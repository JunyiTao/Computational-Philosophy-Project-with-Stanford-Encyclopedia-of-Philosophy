Objections to the Possibility of Survival\u2014Materialism\n\nWhat are the prospects for survival on a materialistic view of\npersons? One possible reason for thinking that materialism is not\nhostile to the prospects of an afterlife is that, historically, the\nstandard view of the afterlife in the major theistic traditions is\nthat it involves the resurrection of bodies. While there is a\nlongstanding theological tradition that links belief in bodily\nresurrection with dualism, many theologians and some philosophers\nargue that dualism is a Platonic import into theistic traditions\n(Cullman 1955), and that it is more in keeping with the Hebrew,\nChristian, and Islamic stress on bodily life to understand the\nafterlife in materialist rather than dualist terms.\n\nThe central logical problem for materialist versions of the\nresurrection is personal identity. On dualist assumptions, personal\nidentity is preserved by the persistence of the soul between death and\nresurrection. But for materialism, nothing bridges the\nspatio-temporal gap between the body that perishes and that body\nresurrected. Without such a bridge, how can the\n\u201cresurrected\u201d person be identical with the person who\ndied? Considerable ingenuity has been expended in the search for an\nanswer to this question.\n\nWithout doubt, the most popular materialist option here is the\n\u201cre-creation\u201d theory, according to which, at some time\nafter a person\u2019s death, God re-creates the person by creating a\nbody with the identical characteristics of the body that perished\n(Hick 1983: 125\u201326). While this may seem rather ghastly in cases\nof violent death, there is no reason why God could not correct any\ninjury and renew the body\u2019s youthfulness, and so on. But can\nthis re-creation preserve the necessity of the identity relation (the\nfact that your persistence over time as you is strict and not\ncontingent)? If you are re-created, the \u201cyou\u201d that comes\ninto existence in the re-creation cannot just contingently happen to\nbe you (as if someone else could do the job of being you). One reason\nto suspect that the identity relationship is not preserved (and this\nis not merely an epistemological matter) is that if God could create\none body that is exactly similar to the body that died, why not two or\nmore? It is not a satisfactory answer to this to say that God, being\ngood, would not (and perhaps could not) do such a thing. On the view\nin question, what is necessary for resurrection is merely that\nmaterial particles be arranged in the correct fashion, and it is\nhardly a necessary truth that only God could do this. (Perhaps a\nreally smart rogue angel could pull it off!) Nor is it feasible to\nguarantee uniqueness by requiring that the identical particles present\nin the dead body make up the resurrected body. On the one hand, the\nbody has no doubt shed, during its life, enough particles to make\nseveral bodies, and it is hardly credible that the replacement of one\nof the atoms present at the time of death with an atom shed by the\nbody a few seconds before death would mean we have a different body\n(assuming other requirements to be satisfied). If, on the other hand,\nonly particles from the body at the time of death may be used, there\nare the long-recognized problems about the availability of some of\nthese particles, which within a few years may have made their ways\ninto a large number of other human bodies. In any case there is a\nhard-to-quell intuition that reassembly, no matter how expertly\ncompleted, would at best produce a replica rather than the identical\nbody that perished. Peter van Inwagen offers a compelling example:\n\n\nSuppose a certain monastery claims to have in its possession a\nmanuscript written in St. Augustine\u2019s own hand. And suppose the\nmonks of this monastery further claim that this manuscript was burned\nby Arians in the year 457. It would immediately occur to us to ask how\nthis manuscript, the one we can touch, could be the very\nmanuscript that was burned in 457. Suppose their answer to this\nquestion is that God miraculously recreated Augustine\u2019s\nmanuscript in 458. We should respond to this answer as follows: the\ndeed it describes seems quite impossible, even as an accomplishment of\nomnipotence. God certainly might have created a perfect duplicate of\nthe original manuscript, but it would not be that one; its\nearliest moment of existence would have been after Augustine\u2019s\ndeath; it would never have known the impress of his hand; it would not\nhave been a part of the furniture of the world when he was alive; and\nso on. Now suppose our monks were to reply by simply asserting that\nthe manuscript now in their possession did know the impress\nof Augustine\u2019s hand; that it was a part of the\nfurniture of the world when the Saint was alive; that when God\nrecreated or restored it, God (as an indispensable component of\naccomplishing this task) saw to it that the object God produced had\nall these properties. [para. break in 1978] \n\nWe confess we should not know what to make of this. We should have to\ntell the monks that we did not see how what they believed could\npossibly be true. (van Inwagen 1992: 242\u201343) \n\n\nGiven these difficulties with the re-creation view, attempts have been\nmade to find other ways of accounting for resurrection in materialist\nterms. One of the more interesting of these is Lynne Rudder\nBaker\u2019s invocation of a constitution view of persons (Baker\n2000, 2001, 2005). On this view persons are not identical with, but\nare constituted by, their bodies. (She discusses the constitution\nrelation at considerable length; the details of this are not relevant\nhere.) What is distinctive of persons is a \u201cfirst-person\nperspective\u201d, roughly, the capacity to think of oneself as\noneself. This ability, which humans possess but other animals\nseem to lack, is an essential component of moral responsibility as\nwell as of our ability to plan for the future and to perform many\nother distinctively personal activities and functions. According to\nBaker, the constitution view opens the way for a doctrine of\nresurrection that avoids the difficulties of the re-creation theory.\nSince persons are not identical with their bodies, it need not be\nmaintained that the resurrected body is the same identical body as the\nbody that died. What is required, however, is that the first-person\nperspective of the resurrected body be the same: \u201cif a\nperson\u2019s first-person perspective were extinguished, the person\nwould go out of existence\u201d (2005: 385). So the first-person\nperspective must somehow be transferred from the original body to the\nresurrection body: \n\n\nperson P1 at t1 is the same person as person P2\nat t2 if and only if P1 and P2 have the same\nfirst-person perspective. (2000: 132) \n\n\nBaker holds that there is indeed a fact of the matter as to whether a\ngiven future person has the same first-person perspective as I now\nhave, though there is no \u201cinformative\u201d way of specifying\ncriteria of identity between the two.\n\nAlthough Baker\u2019s account is intriguing, it seems problematic\nwhen one takes a closer look at the idea of a first-person\nperspective. Arguably, to have a first-person perspective, one has to\nbe a person. To have a first-person perspective is to have the\ncapacity to experience things; to act, think, speak, and so on with\nintention. Such acts can in principle be qualitatively identical in\ndifferent thinkers and speakers; what individuates them is the\nperson who\u2019s doing the thinking or speaking. In other\nwords, intentional acts derive their identity from the person\nperforming them. But if this is true of the acts themselves it is also\ntrue of the first-person perspectives, which are nothing but the\ncapacities of various persons to perform such acts. So to say that\nP1 and P2 have the same first-person perspective is just\nto say that P1 and P2 are the same person, and the\ncriterion reduces to a tautology. Regrettably, we have not yet been\ngiven any help in understanding how a person, with her\nfirst-person perspective, can occupy first one body and then\nanother.\n\nAnother proposal is offered by Kevin Corcoran (2005). Corcoran, like\nBaker, is a constitution theorist, but, unlike Baker, he does not\nbelieve persons can be transferred from one body to another. Corcoran\nproposes that the body of a resurrected person does need to be\nidentical with the body of the person when he died. Corcoran advances\nseveral proposals about how this might be possible. The one to be\nnoted here is what might be termed a \u201cbrute force\u201d\nsolution: \n\n\nIf God causes that body to exist once, why could God not cause it to\nexist a second time? \u2026 But what makes the first stage of the\npost-gap body a different stage of the same body that perished is just\nthat God makes it so. (2005: 172) \n\n This comes extremely close to making identity over time a matter\nof convention\u2014divine convention, to be sure, but convention all\nthe same. (It is reminiscent of Jonathan Edwards\u2019 view that we\nare justly punished for Adam\u2019s sin in the Garden of Eden because\nGod has decreed that the segment of Adam\u2019s life including the\nsin is a segment of our own lives also.) It is difficult to measure\nwhen an appeal to divine fiat is philosophically licit or illicit. The\nchallenge facing Corcoran\u2019s position may be similar to the one\nHick faces: how would God distinguish between re-creating the same\nbody that was destroyed earlier and creating an exact duplicate? For a\nrecent treatment of survival from a materialist perspective, see\nMerrick 2022.\n\nWe have left until last van Inwagen\u2019s own proposal for a\nmaterialist resurrection. For in spite of his criticisms of the common\nview, van Inwagen is himself a Christian and a believer in the\nresurrection. Here is his proposal:\n\n\nPerhaps at the moment of each man\u2019s death, God removes his\ncorpse and replaces it with a simulacrum which is what is burned or\nrots. Or perhaps God is not quite so wholesale as this: perhaps He\nremoves for \u201csafekeeping\u201d only the \u201ccore\nperson\u201d\u2014the brain and central nervous system\u2014or even\nsome special part of it. These are details. (van Inwagen 1992:\n245\u201346)\n\n\nContinuity is maintained, then, through the preservation of the body\n(or crucial body-part, such as the brain), and when the time comes for\nresurrection to occur, God restores life to the body in question and\none\u2019s resurrected life can begin. In fairness, it should be\npointed out that van Inwagen originally advanced this proposal only in\norder to demonstrate the logical possibility of a materialist\nresurrection. In this he may well have succeeded. But as a proposal\nthat is supposed to represent the actual way in which God enables\nhumans to live again, the account has very little to recommend it. In\nthis view, God assumes the role of contemporary practitioners of\ncryonics, preserving the dead body until such time as it is revived\nand restored to health. But this is bad news for the actual\npractitioners, since the \u201cbodies\u201d they are preserving are\nmere simulacra and presumably incapable of being revived, even if all\nthe technology functions flawlessly. Furthermore, the feature of the\naccount that makes it unacceptable\u2014that God \u201cspirits\naway\u201d the crucial part of the person\u2019s body, leaving\nbehind a simulacrum\u2014is essential to the view\u2019s success in\ndepicting a possible way of resurrection. In the Author\u2019s Note\nappended in 1992, van Inwagen writes:\n\n\nIf I were writing a paper on this topic today, I should not make the\ndefinite statement \u201cI think this is the only way such a\nbeing could accomplish it\u201d. I am now inclined to think that\nthere may well be other ways, ways that I am unable even to form an\nidea of because I lack the conceptual resources to do so. (1992:\n246)\n\n\nA more recent, and extremely ingenious, account of an afterlife from a\nmaterialist point of view has been proposed by Dean Zimmerman. The\nproposal goes roughly like this: at the instant of death, each\nelementary particle in a person\u2019s body undergoes\n\u201cbudding\u201d in which it produces another particle of the\nsame kind. The newly produced particle takes its place in a\nresurrection body, existing in a resurrection \u201cspace\u201d; at\nthe same time the original particle remains in place as part of the\ncorpse. Since it is the resurrection body, and not the corpse, which\ncontinues the life of the subject, the resurrection body rather than\nthe corpse is the \u201cclosest continuer\u201d of the pre-death\nbody. It is, then, the resurrection body and not the corpse that is\nthe same body as the one that previously lived, and personal identity\nis preserved. This proposal abandons strict (Leibnizian) identity in\nfavor of a \u201cclosest continuer\u201d theory. It also shares an\ninteresting feature with van Inwagen\u2019s account: the remaining\ncorpse is not the same body as the one that previously lived.\n(Zimmerman 1999 and 2010; Hasker 2011). For a critical analysis of\nZimmerman and van Inwagen thought experiments, see Taliaferro &\nKnuths 2017 and Knuths 2018.\n\nIt has not been shown conclusively that an identity-preserving\nmaterialist resurrection is impossible, but the difficulties, as\noutlined above, are formidable (Hasker 1999: 211\u201331). Proponents\nof an afterlife, it seems, would be better served if they were able to\nespouse some variety of mind-body dualism. This entry cannot undertake\nan assessment of the comparative merits of dualism and materialism. It\nis worth noting, however, that recent philosophy has seen an increased\nrecognition in some quarters of the difficulties resulting from\nmaterialist views, and a corresponding interest in different (not\nnecessarily Cartesian) varieties of dualism. (See Koons & Bealer\n(eds.) 2010; Batthyany & Elitzur (eds.) 2009; Loose, Menuge, &\nMoreland 2018; and Lofton 2017.) Given even the apparent coherence of\ndualism in which the person and her body are contingently related\n(metaphysically, it becomes more difficult to argue that it is known\nthat the annihilation of the body entails the annihilation of the\nperson).\n",
