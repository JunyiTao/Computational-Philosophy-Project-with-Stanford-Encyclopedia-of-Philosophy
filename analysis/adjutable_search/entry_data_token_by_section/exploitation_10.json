    "main_text": "Applied Issues in Exploitation Theory || Universal Basic Income\n4.1 Universal Basic Income\n\nSome theorists, such as Philippe van Pairjs, have argued that justice\nrequires that the state institute a universal basic income (UBI). A\nUBI is a cash transfer, funded by taxes, that would be paid to all\ncitizens regardless of need, and regardless of whether they are\nworking, or even willing to work (van Parijs 1995). Against this, some\ncritics have charged that a basic income would facilitate a form of\nexploitation. As Stuart White argues,\n\n\nwhere others bear some cost in order to contribute to a scheme of\ncooperation, then it is unfair for one to willingly enjoy the intended\nbenefits of their cooperative efforts unless one is willing to bear\nthe cost of making a relevantly proportionate contribution to this\nscheme of cooperation in return. (White 1997: 317\u2013318)\n\n\nAs is so often the case in dealing with exploitation claims, assessing\nthis objection requires us to grapple with a complicated mix of\nempirical and normative claims. On the empirical side, for instance,\nwe might ask whether a basic income really would lead to a\nnet increase in reciprocity-violating transfers. Some theorists have\nargued that a basic income would actually increase incentives to work\nrelative to currently existing welfare programs, by lowering the\neffective marginal tax rate faced by low-wage workers (Tobin 1966).\nOthers have emphasized the role of unpaid labor in the economy, such\nas domestic labor, and argued that a basic income would lead to a\nfairer application of the reciprocity principle than welfare systems\nthat condition benefits on doing paid work (Pateman 2004).\nNormatively, the objection challenges us to think about both what the\nideal of reciprocity requires and how it fits within a system of\nbroader distributive justice. Some advocates of basic income have\nargued that a liberal-egalitarian theory of justice is correct and\nrequires an equal distribution of scarce resources such as land rent\nand the rent component of wages (van Parijs 1997: 329). Reciprocity\nmay be an important political value, such theorists argue, but it is\none that is to be applied only after people have been given\nwhat they are due at the basic level of justice.\n",
