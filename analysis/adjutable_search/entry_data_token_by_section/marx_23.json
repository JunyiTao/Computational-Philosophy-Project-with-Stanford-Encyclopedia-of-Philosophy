    "main_text": "Ideology || Characteristics\n6.3 Characteristics\n\nFor Marx ideological beliefs are social in that they are widely\nshared, indeed so widely-shared that for long periods they constitute\nthe \u201cruling\u201d or \u201cdominant\u201d ideas in a given\nclass-divided society (MECW 5: 59). And they are social in\nthat they directly concern, or indirectly impact upon, the\naction-guiding understandings of self and society that individuals\nhave. These action-guiding understandings include the dominant legal,\npolitical, religious, and philosophical views within particular\nclass-divided societies in periods of stability (MECW 29: 263).\n\nNot all false or misleading beliefs count for Marx as ideological.\nHonest scientific error, for example can be non-ideological. And\nideological belief can be misleading without being strictly false. For\nexample, defenders of the capitalist economy portray what Marx calls\nthe \u201cwage form\u201d, with its exchange of equivalents, as the\nwhole (rather than a part) of the story about the relation between\ncapital and labour, thereby ignoring the exploitation which occurs in\nthe sphere of production. Indeed, the notion of the\n\u201cfalsity\u201d of ideology needs to be expanded beyond the\ncontent of the \u201cideas\u201d in question, to include cases where\ntheir origins are in some way contaminated (Geuss 1981: 19\u201322).\nPerhaps the only reason I believe something to be the case is that the\nbelief in question has a consoling effect on me. Arguably such a\nbelief is held ideologically, even if it happens to be true.\nNevertheless paradigmatic examples of ideology have a false content.\nFor example, ideology often portrays institutions, policies, and\ndecisions which are in the interests of the economically dominant\nclass, as being in the interests of the society as a whole\n(MECW 5: 60); and ideology often portrays social and\npolitical arrangements which are contingent, or historical, or\nartificial, as being necessary, or universal, or natural\n(MECW 35: 605).\n\nIn addition to false or misleading content, ideological beliefs\ntypically have at least two additional characteristics, relating to\ntheir social origin and their class function. By the \u201csocial\norigin\u201d of ideology is meant that Marx thinks of these ideas as\noften originating with, and being reinforced by, the complex structure\nof class-divided societies\u2014a complex structure in which a\ndeceptive surface appearance is governed by underlying essential\nrelations (Geras 1986: 63\u201384). Capitalism is seen as especially\ndeceptive in appearance; for example, Marx often contrasts the\nrelative transparency of \u201cexploitation\u201d under feudalism,\nwith the way in which the \u201cwage form\u201d obscures the ratio\nof necessary and surplus labour in capitalist societies. Ideology\nstems, in part, from this deceptive surface appearance which makes it\ndifficult to grasp the underlying social flaws that benefit the\neconomically dominant class. Marx portrays the striving to uncover\nessences concealed by misleading appearances as characteristic of\nscientific endeavour (MECW 37, 804). And, in this context, he\ndistinguishes between classical political economy, which\nstrove\u2014albeit not always successfully\u2014to uncover the\nessential relations often concealed behind misleading appearances, and\nwhat he calls vulgar economy, which happily restricts itself to the\nmisleading appearances themselves (MECW 37, 804).\n\nBy the \u201cclass function\u201d of ideology is meant that Marx\nholds that the pervasiveness of ideology is explained by the fact it\nhelps stabilise the economic structure of societies. All sorts of\nideas might get generated for all sorts of reasons, but the ones that\ntend to \u201cstick\u201d (become widely accepted) in class-divided\nsocieties do so, not because of their truth, but because they conceal\nor misrepresent or justify flaws in that society in ways which redound\nto the benefit of the economically dominant class (Rosen & Wolff\n1996: 235\u2013236).\n\nIn response critics often see this as just another example of sloppy\nfunctional reasoning\u2014purportedly widespread in the Marxist\ntradition\u2014whereby a general pattern is asserted without the\nidentification of any of the mechanisms which might generate that\npattern. In the present case, it is said that Marx never properly\nexplains why the ruling ideas should be those of the ruling class\n(Elster 1985: 473). Yet there are obvious possible mechanisms here. To\ngive two examples. First, there is the control of the ruling class\nover the means of mental production, and in particular the print and\nbroadcast media which in capitalist societies are typically owned and\ncontrolled by the very wealthy (MECW 5, 59). A second\npossible mechanism appeals to the psychological need of individuals\nfor invented narratives that legitimise or justify their social\nposition; for instance, Marx identifies a widespread need, in flawed\nsocieties, for the consolatory effects of religion (MECW 3,\n175).\n",
