    "main_text": "Civil and Canon Law\n6. Civil and Canon Law\n\nHistorians point to another \u201crenaissance\u201d (i.e., another\nstage in the re-appropriation of the culture of antiquity) during the\ntwelfth century. This \u201crenaissance of the twelfth century\u201d\nincluded a revival in the study of civil law, i.e., the Roman law as\ncodified and digested by Justinian and his officials (the Corpus\niuris civilis, 533/4),[21]\n and this stimulated and influenced the study of canon law, beginning\nwith Gratian\u2019s\n Decretum.[22]\n\n\nIdeas that medieval political thinkers took\u2014in different ways\nand to different degrees\u2014from the law texts included the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\nA distinction among kinds of laws, namely natural law (ius\nnaturale), law of nations (ius gentium), and civil law\n(i.e., the law of a particular community). The law textbooks were\nperhaps the main source of the idea of natural law, so important to\nlater medieval political thought. This idea can be traced back to\nCicero, to the Stoics, and to Aristotle, but most medieval political\nphilosophers encountered it in Gratian\u2019s Decretum. (As\na rule, medieval theologians and philosophers evince a greater\nfamiliarity with the collections of canon law than with the Corpus\niuris civilis.)\n\n\nA notion of rights, including natural rights (\u201chuman\nrights\u201d as we would say), attributable to individuals. It is\nnoteworthy that the language of rights, without which many people\nthese days would not know how to talk about politics, did not fully\nenter political philosophy until the fourteenth century as a borrowing\nfrom the\n law.[23]\n\n\n\nA belief in \u201cthe one liberty of all men\u201d, that is, the\nidea that human beings are basically equal and that slavery is\ncontrary to natural law, though in accordance with the law of\n nations.[24]\n\n\n\nAn account, or rather two accounts, of the origin of property:\naccording to some Roman law texts, property originated by natural law;\naccording to others by the law of\n nations.[25]\n According to canon law, property exists by human law (which includes\nthe law of nations and the civil law); compare Augustine\u2019s\nstatement that property exists by the laws of the emperors\n (\u00a74.3\n above).[26] \n\n\nA canon law doctrine that human law cannot altogether abolish the\noriginal commonness of things under natural law. Property owners must\nhelp the poor (see Ambrose, end of\n \u00a73\n above), and in cases of necessity, a person may assert the natural\nright to use anything needed to sustain\n life.[27]\n\n\n\nThe doctrine that the source of political authority is the people, who\nhave, however, entrusted their power to the emperor or other\n ruler.[28]\n\n\n\nThe doctrine that either the pope or emperor (or both) has a\n\u201cfullness of power\u201d (see\n \u00a78\n below).\n\n\nThe doctrine that natural law permits an individual to resist force by\nforce (Digest 1.1.3; D. 1 c. 7, trans. in Gratian [c. 1140]\n1993: 7). This doctrine would provide a premise for arguments for the\nright to resist a tyrannical government, used later by\n Locke.\n\n\nA distinction between Church and State\u2014more exactly, between the\npriesthood and the power of the emperor, each independent in its own\nsphere, though the priesthood has the higher function. The classic\nplace for this doctrine is the canon Duo\n sunt.[29]\n Another canon, Cum ad verum, gave reasons for the\nseparation: mutual limitation of their powers would restrain the pride\nof priest and emperor, and those on God\u2019s service (the clergy)\nshould be kept free of worldly entanglements (D. 96 c. 6; translated\nin Tierney 1980: 14\u201315). This was also the force of the canons\nSicut enim and Te\n quidem.[30]\n\n\n\nVarious legal ideas relating to\n corporations[31]\n and representation (including the distinction between a head\u2019s\ncapacity as head and his private capacity), the need for meetings to\ndeal with common concerns (\u201cwhat touches everyone must be\ndiscussed and approved by\n everyone\u201d),[32]\n and majority decision (or some qualified version thereof) when there\nis no unanimity (decision by \u201cthe greater and sounder\n part\u201d).[33]\n\n\n\nOf these points, what was probably most important for medieval\npolitical philosophy was the idea of natural law.\n",
