    "main_text": "Historical Background || Historical-Philological Semantics\n2.2 Historical-Philological Semantics\n\nHistorical-philological semantics incorporated elements from all the\nabove classical traditions and dominated the linguistic scene roughly\nfrom 1870 to 1930, with the work of scholars such as Michel\nBr\u00e9al, Hermann Paul, and Ars\u00e8ne Darmesteter (Gordon\n1982). In particular, it absorbed from speculative etymology an\ninterest in the conceptual mechanisms underlying the formation of word\nmeaning, it acquired from rhetorical analysis a taxonomic toolkit for\nthe classification of lexical phenomena, and it assimilated from\nlexicography and textual philology the empirical basis of descriptive\ndata that subsequent theories of word meaning would have to account\nfor (Geeraerts 2013).\n\nOn the methodological side, the key features of the approach to word\nmeaning introduced by historical-philological semantics can be\nsummarized as follows. First, it had a diachronic and pragmatic\norientation. That is, it was primarily concerned with the historical\nevolution of word meaning rather than with word meaning statically\nunderstood, and attributed great importance to the contextual\nflexibility of word meaning. Witness Paul\u2019s (1920 [1880])\ndistinction between usuelle Bedeutung and okkasionelle\nBedeutung, or Br\u00e9al\u2019s (1924 [1897]) account of\npolysemy as a byproduct of semantic change. Second, it looked at word\nmeaning primarily as a psychological phenomenon. It assumed that the\nsemantic properties of words should be defined in mentalistic terms\n(i.e., words signify \u201cconcepts\u201d or \u201cideas\u201d in\na broad sense), and that the dynamics of sense modulation, extension,\nand contraction that underlie lexical change correspond to broader\npatterns of conceptual activity in the human mind. Interestingly,\nwhile the classical rhetorical tradition had conceived of tropes as\nmarginal linguistic phenomena whose investigation, albeit important,\nwas primarily motivated by stylistic concerns, for\nhistorical-philological semantics the psychological mechanisms\nunderlying the production and the comprehension of figures of speech\nwere part of the ordinary life of languages, and engines of the\nevolution of all aspects of lexical systems (Nerlich 1992).\n\nThe contribution made by historical-philological semantics to the\nstudy of word meaning had a long-lasting influence. First, with its\nemphasis on the principles of semantic change, historical-philological\nsemantics was the first systematic framework to focus on the dynamic\nnature of word meaning, and established contextual flexibility as the\nprimary explanandum for a theory of word meaning (Nerlich & Clarke\n1996, 2007). This feature of historical-philological semantics is a\nclear precursor of the emphasis placed on context-sensitivity by many\nsubsequent approaches to word meaning, both in philosophy (see\n Section 3)\n and in linguistics (see\n Section 4).\n Second, the psychologistic approach to word meaning fostered by\nhistorical philological-semantics added to the agenda of linguistic\nresearch the question of how word meaning relates to cognition at\nlarge. If word meaning is essentially a psychological phenomenon, what\npsychological categories should be used to characterize it? What is\nthe dividing line separating the aspects of our mental life that\nconstitute knowledge of word meaning from those that do not? As we\nshall see, this question will constitute a central concern for\ncognitive theories of word meaning (see\n Section 5).\n",
