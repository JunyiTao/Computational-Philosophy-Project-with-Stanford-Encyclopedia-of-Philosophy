    "main_text": "Objections to Fictionalism and Responses || Mysterious Extra Content\n2.6 Mysterious Extra Content\n\nThomasson (2013) raises an objection to Yablo\u2019s specific version\nof fictionalism. As we saw above, Yablo (2005, 2002a, 2002b)\ndistinguishes between the literal contents and the real\ncontents of sentences like \n\n(M) The number of Martian moons is 2.\n\nThomasson argues that Yablo is committed to the claim that\nsomething more is needed for the truth of the literal\ncontents of sentences like (M) than is needed for the truth of the\nreal contents of these sentences. But what could this extra\nsomething be? According to Thomasson, this is obscure, and unless\nYablo can say something more about this, we ought not to accept his\nview. \n\nOne response to this\u2014given by Contessa (2016, p. 771)\u2014is\nthat it\u2019s obvious what more is needed; it needs to be the case\nthat there are \u201cmind-independent, non-spatiotemporally located,\ncausally inert abstract objects.\u201d \n\nA different response is given by Plebani (2018). He argues that\nregardless of whether Yablovian fictionalists can articulate two\ndifferent truth conditions for sentences like (M), the real and\nliteral contents of these sentences can be distinguished because they\nhave different subject matters. \n",
