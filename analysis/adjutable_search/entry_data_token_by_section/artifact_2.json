    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Do Artifacts Exist?\n2.1 Do Artifacts Exist?\n\nSkepticism about the existence of artifacts goes back at least to\nAristotle. For him, the primary existents are\nsubstances\u2014independent things on which all other things depend.\nIndividual things, such as horses or houses, are compounds of matter\nand form, but it is not entirely clear whether the substance of the\nthing is the form, the matter, or the compound (Shields 2022). That\nsaid, Aristotle is clearly ambivalent as to whether artifacts have\nwhat it takes. In the Physics (192b8\u201339), for instance,\nhe says that some things, such as chipmunks or geraniums, exist by\nnature and that each such thing is a substance. He follows this up in\nthe Metaphysics (1043b15\u201325), saying that perhaps\nonly such things as exist by nature are substances, thus\nimplying that things made by art, such as pots or pincushions, are\nnot. Exactly why Aristotle thinks artifacts are not substances is not\nentirely clear\u2014he suggests different reasons in different places\n(Katayama 1999, 18\u201319). But it is clear that he doubts that\nthey really exist in the full sense enjoyed by things that exist by\nnature.\n\nAristotle\u2019s invidious ontological downgrading of artifacts fed\nstraight into 20th century trends in metaphysics that\ntended to downgrade ordinary objects in general (Thomasson 2009). Even\nafter the baleful anti-metaphysical influence of logical positivism\nwaned, metaphysics took itself to be merely working out the details of\nwhat the dominant scientific theories, particularly in physics and\nbiology, say exists. Since there is no science of artifacts, let alone\nof sticks and stones and rivers, such ordinary objects had to be\neliminated from our ontologies. On the radical left fringe of the\neliminativist spectrum is a startling long list of theorists who deny\nthe existence of ordinary objects tout court, including even\nliving organisms and persons (for the list, see Korman\n2015, 19\u201323). In the moderate middle are theorists such as\nTrenton Merricks (2001), who denies the existence of artifacts and\nother inanimate macrophysical objects, as well as living organisms,\nwith the exception of humans; Peter van Inwagen (1990), who denies the\nexistence of artifacts and other inanimate macrophysical objects, but\naccepts the existence of living organisms, including humans; and Simon\nEvnine (2016), who denies the existence of inanimate natural objects,\nbut accepts the existence of artifacts and living organisms.\n\nThe arguments for these varieties of eliminativism are themselves\nvarious, but they revolve around what Daniel Korman\n(2015, 4\u20137) calls debunking arguments. Why do we think that\nordinary objects exist? Only because they correspond to our human\nneeds and interests, as embodied in our biology and enshrined in our\ncultural practices. But there is no good reason to think that the\nobjects we pick out in accordance with our needs and interests\ncorrespond to the objects that actually exist in reality. Debunking\narguments go back to the very beginning of Western philosophy.\nParmenides declared that what truly is\u2014Being, or the\nOne\u2014cannot be multiple, changing and transient after the fashion\nof ordinary objects. Plato followed up with the doctrine of the\neternal and unchanging Forms, which truly exist, and of which ordinary\nobjects are at best ontologically deficient copies. Thus the idea that\nwe have no good reason to think that ordinary objects exist is\nentrenched in our metaphysical tradition.\n\nOn the other hand, prima facie grounds for rehabilitating\nordinary objects also have ancient roots in atomism, which holds that\nmacrophysical objects are composed of particles which, while multiple,\ndo meet the other criteria for true being laid down by Parmenides. On\nthe assumption that composition follows regular principles, then,\nordinary objects may be said to exist insofar as they are wholes\ncomposed of existing proper parts. This brings us face to face with\nwhat Peter van Inwagen (1990, 21 ff.) calls the Special\nComposition Question\u2014under what conditions do unified\nwholes arise out of parts? Answering this question has turned out to\nbe far from simple, and has latterly given rise to mereology, a\nspecial area of metaphysics devoted to investigating the principles of\ncomposition. Most of the other main arguments against the existence of\nartifacts and other ordinary objects reflect problems arising in the\ncourse of these investigations. For example, there is the material\nconstitution problem. An artifact such as a cookie is made out of\ndough. So everywhere there is a cookie there is a coincident lump of\n(baked) dough, which shares all of its parts with the cookie. But this\ncoincidence violates our intuitions about the identity of ordinary\nobjects. Considerations of this sort have been used by van Inwagen\n(1990, 124 ff.) and others to argue that there are no artifacts.\nCookie makers do not bring anything new into existence; they merely\nmove pre-existing elementary things around. Thus, while debunking\narguments show that we have no good reason to believe ordinary objects\ndo exist, mereological problems show that we have good\nreasons to believe they do not.\n\nA growing chorus of voices has been raised against this ontological\ndowngrading of ordinary objects, several of whom have been especially\nconcerned to rehabilitate artifacts. Lynne Rudder Baker\u2019s\nMetaphysics of Everyday Life (2007) foregrounds artifacts as\nparadigmatic examples of existing ordinary objects. Baker subscribes\nto a constitution view, according to which material things are\nnon-reductively made up of other material things.\n\n\nThe fundamental idea of constitution is this: when a thing of one\nprimary kind is in certain circumstances, a thing of another primary\nkind\u2014a new thing, with new causal powers\u2014comes to exist.\nWhen an octagonal piece of metal is in circumstances of being painted\nred with white marks of the shape S-T-O-P, and is in an environment\nthat has certain conventions and laws, a new thing\u2014a traffic\nsign\u2014comes into existence. (Baker 2007, 32)\n\n\nImportantly, for Baker artifacts are intention-dependent (ID)\nobjects\u2014they cannot exist in the absence of beings with relevant\nintentional states. Thus the cosmic ray striking a sheet of scrap\nmetal in the proverbial swamp and turning it red with white lettering\nhas not created any artifact at all, let alone a stop sign. Baker\nbuilds the intentional states into the specification of the required\ncircumstances in terms of a relationship between the construction\nmaterials and the intentions and knowledge of the constructor. For a\nstop sign to exist, for example, it must be constructed from metal and\npaint by someone who understands the function of stop signs, knows how\nto construct one, intends to construct one to fulfill this function,\nand is reasonably successful in executing her intentions\n(2007, 53\u201355). This view puts Baker at odds with\nAristotle\u2019s view that only things with an internal principle of\nmovement truly exist, as well as with the common view that ID objects\ndo not truly exist. Both of these views are aimed at first\ndistinguishing natural from artificial objects and then downgrading\nthe latter. Baker argues that the distinction itself is suspect, both\nin light of technologies such as genetic engineering and the natural\nstatus of the beings with intentional states who create artifacts\n(2007, 59\u201366). In short, the whole process of making\nartifacts is internal to nature and cannot be legitimately considered\nseparate from it by those inclined to be judgmental in ontological\nmatters.\n\nSimon Evnine (2016) argues for a version of hylomorphism that is very\nsimilar to the constitution view espoused by Baker. Evnine abandons\ntraditional notions of form and focuses instead on the intertwining of\nthe causes that bring a thing into existence and make it the thing it\nis. Artifacts thus take pride of place in his metaphysics, because, he\nclaims, they typically have a specifiable origin in the intentions of\na maker who chooses material and works it up in accordance with an\nenvisioned function and shape. Evnine\u2019s account of organisms as\nexistents rests on an analogy between this paradigmatic intentional\nmaking and organic development. But he does not try to account for\nnon-living natural objects, whose existence he denies. On the other\nhand, Evnine deploys his account of artifacts in an interesting way to\nargue that actions are artifacts\u2014artifactual events rather than\nartifactual objects. Higher-level actions such as turning on a light\nare governed by the agent\u2019s intention and constructed ultimately\nout of the \u201cmatter\u201d of basic, bodily actions.\n\nAmie Thomasson (2007a; and for a succinct summary, 2009) takes a\ndifferent tack, arguing that the existence of artifacts and other\nordinary objects is established by the connection between our terms on\nthe one hand, and facts about the world on the other. On her view, the\nmeaning of our terms includes a specification of the conditions for\ntheir application. If we then determine empirically that the\napplication conditions of a term are met, the thing to which it refers\nexists. For example, \u201cspoon\u201d refers to a utensil\nintentionally made by humans for the purposes of stirring, serving and\neating food, consisting of a shallow bowl with a long handle. A quick\ncheck of any kitchen will assure you that these conditions are in fact\nsatisfied, and that spoons therefore exist. On the other hand,\n\u201cdevil\u2019s tuning fork\u201d refers to an implement\nconsisting of three cylindrical prongs on one end and two rectangular\nprongs on the other, intentionally made by devils for the purpose of\ntuning their instruments, one would suppose. Check the music studios\nand the concert halls as thoroughly as you like, you will not find\nthese conditions satisfied. So devil\u2019s tuning forks do not\nexist. Thomasson\u2019s approach does not privilege artifacts as\nparadigmatic existents the way Baker\u2019s and Evnine\u2019s\naccounts do. But she makes the intention-dependent status of artifacts\nequally comprehensible, since the intentional states of makers figure\nprominently in the application conditions of concepts.\n",
