    "main_text": "Possibilities || Domain Restrictions\n5.1 Domain Restrictions\nSometimes, in the nature of the alternatives under consideration\nand how individual preferences among them are determined, not all\nindividual preferences can arise. When studying such a case within\nArrow\u2019s framework there is no need for a social welfare function that\ncan handle each and every \\(n\\)-tuple of individual orderings. Some but\nnot all profiles are admissible, and the domain is said to\nbe restricted. In fortunate cases, it is then possible to find a\nsocial welfare function that meets all assumptions and conditions of\nArrow\u2019s theorem\u2014apart, of course, from U. Such domains\nare said to be Arrow consistent. This Section considers some\nimportant examples of Arrow consistent domains.\nFor a simple illustration, consider the following profile: \n\nABC\nABC\nCBA\n\nHere, two of the three people have the same strict preference\nordering. Reckoning the collective preference by pairwise majority\ndecision, it is easy to see that the result is the ordering of this\nmajority: ABC. Consider now a domain made up entirely of\nsuch profiles, in which most of the three voters share the same\nstrict preferences. On such a domain, pairwise majority decision\nalways derives an ordering and so it satisfies SO. This\nsocial welfare function is nondictatorial as well provided the\ndomain, though restricted, still retains a certain variety. In the\nabove profile, voter \\(3\\) strictly prefers \\(B\\) to \\(A\\). Both of the\nothers strictly prefer \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), though, and that is the\nsocial preference: with this profile in the domain, \\(3\\) is no\ndictator. Pairwise majority\ndecision satisfies \nD if each of the voters disagrees in this way with both of\nthe others, in some or other profile.[10]\nIt always satisfies WP\nand I. On such a domain, we have now seen, this aggregation\nprocedure satisfies all of Arrow\u2019s non-domain conditions. Such a\ndomain is Arrow consistent.\nFull identity of preferences is not needed for Arrow\nconsistency. It can be enough that everybody\u2019s preferences are\nsimilar, even if they never entirely agree. An example illustrates the\ncase of single peaked domains.\nSuppose three bears get together to decide how hot their common pot\nof porridge will be. Papa bear likes hot porridge, the hotter the\nbetter. Mama bear likes cold porridge, the colder the better. Baby\nbear most likes warm porridge; hot porridge is next best as far as he\nis concerned (\u201cit will always cool off\u201d), and he doesn\u2019t\nlike cold porridge at all. These preferences among hot, warm and cold\nporridge can be represented as a preference profile:\n\nPapa: Hot Warm Cold\nMama: Cold Warm Hot\nBaby: Warm Hot Cold\n\nOr else they can be pictured like this:\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThis preference profile is single peaked. Each bear has a\n\u201cbliss point\u201d somewhere along the ordering of the options\nby their temperature, and each bear likes options less and less as we\nmove along this common ordering away from the bliss point, on either\nside. Single peaked preferences arise with respect to the\nleft-right orientation of political candidates, the cost of\nalternative public projects, and other salient attributes of\noptions. Single peaked profiles, in which everybody\u2019s\npreferences are single peaked with respect to a common ordering, arise\nnaturally when everybody cares about the same thing in the options\nunder consideration\u2014temperature, left-right orientation, cost,\nor what have you\u2014even if, as with the bears, there is no further\nconsensus about which options are better than which.\nDuncan Black (1948) showed that if the number of\nvoters is odd, and their preference profile is single peaked,\npairwise majority decision always delivers up an\nordering.[11]\nFurthermore, he showed, the maximum of this ordering is the bliss\npoint of the median voter\u2014the voter whose bliss point\nhas, on the common ordering, as many voters\u2019 bliss points to one side\nas it has to the other. In the example this is Baby bear, and warm\nporridge is the collective maximum.  This example illustrates the way\nin which single peakedness can facilitate compromise.\nSay the number of voters is odd. Now consider a\nsingle-peaked domain\u2014one that is made up entirely of\nsingle peaked profiles. Black\u2019s result tells us that pairwise\nmajority decision on this domain satisfies SO. Provided the\ndomain is sufficiently inclusive (so that for each \\(i\\) there is\nwithin the domain some profile in which \\(i\\) is not the median voter)\nit also satisfies D. Pairwise majority decision always\nsatisfies WP and I, so such a domain is Arrow\nconsistent. With an even number of voters, single peakedness\ndoes not ensure satisfaction of SO. For example, suppose\nthere are just two voters and that their individual orderings are:\n\nCAB\nBCA\n\nPairwise majority decision derives from this profile a weak social\npreference for \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), since there is one who weakly prefers \\(A\\)\nto \\(B\\), and one who weakly prefers \\(B\\) to \\(A\\). Similarly, it derives\na weak social preference for \\(B\\) to \\(C\\). Transitivity requires a weak\nsocial preference for \\(A\\) to \\(C\\), but there is none. On the contrary,\nthere is a strict social preference for \\(C\\) above \\(A\\), since that is\nthe unanimous preference of the voters.  Still, this profile is\nsingle peaked with respect to the common ordering \\(BCA\\):\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nMajority decision with \u201cphantom\u201d voters can be used to\nestablish Arrow consistency when the number of people is even. Let\nthere be \\(2n\\) people, and let each profile in the domain be single\npeaked with respect to one and the same ordering of the\nalternatives. Let \\(R_{2n+1}\\) be an ordering that also is single peaked\nwith respect to this common ordering.  \\(R_{2n+1}\\) represents the\npreferences of a \u201cphantom\u201d voter. Now take each profile\n\\(\\langle R_{1},\\ldots, R_{2n}\\rangle\\) in the domain and expand it\ninto \\(\\langle R_{1},\\ldots, R_{2n}, R_{2n+1}\\rangle\\), by adding\n\\(R_{2n+1}\\). The set of all the expanded profiles is a single peaked\ndomain and, because the real voters together with the phantom are odd\nin number, Black\u2019s result applies to it. Let \\(g\\) be pairwise majority\ndecision for the expanded domain. We obtain a social welfare function\n\\(f\\) for the original domain by assigning to each profile the ordering\nthat \\(g\\) assigns to its expansion. That is, we put:\n\n\\[\nf\\langle R_{1},\\ldots, R_{2n}\\rangle = \n g\\langle R_{1},\\ldots, R_{2n}, R_{2n+1}\\rangle.\n\\]\n\nThis \\(f\\) satisfies SO because \\(g\\) does. It\nsatisfies WP because there are more real voters than\nphantoms (\\(2n\\) to \\(1\\); we could have used any odd number of phantoms\nsmaller than \\(2n\\)). \\(f\\) satisfies I because the phantom\nordering is the same in all profiles of the expanded domain. If the\ndomain includes sufficient variety among profiles then \\(f\\) also\nsatisfies D and is Arrow consistent. This nice idea of\nphantom voters was introduced by Moulin (1980), who used it to\ncharacterize a class of voting schemes that are non-manipulable, in\nthat they do not provide opportunities for strategic\nvoting. \nDomain restrictions have been the focus of much\nresearch in recent decades. Gaertner (2001) provides a general\noverview. Le Breton and Weymark (2006) survey work on domain\nrestrictions that arise naturally when analyzing economic problems in\nArrow\u2019s framework. Miller (1992) suggests that deliberation can\nfacilitate rational social choice by transforming initial preferences\ninto single peaked preferences.  List and Dryzek (2003) argue that\ndeliberation can bring about a \u201cstructuration\u201d of\nindividual preferences that facilitates democratic decision making\neven without achieving full single-peakedness. List et al. (2013)\npresent empirical evidence that deliberation sometimes does have this\neffect.\nAs Samuelson described it, the single profile approach might seem\nto amount to the most severe of domain restrictions:\n\n\n[O]ne and only one of the [\u2026] possible\npatterns of individuals\u2019 orderings is needed. [\u2026]\nFrom it (not from each of them all) comes a social\nordering. (Samuelson 1967: 48\u201349)\n\n According to Sen (1977), though, the\nBergson-Samuelson social welfare function has more than a single\nprofile in its domain. It has in fact a completely unrestricted\ndomain, for while according to Samuelson only one profile is needed\n\u201cit could be any one\u201d (Samuelson 1967: 49). What\ndistinguishes the single profile approach, on Sen\u2019s way of\nunderstanding it, is that there is to be no coordinating the behavior\nof the social welfare function at several different profiles, by\nimposing on it interprofile conditions such as I\nand SN (see Section 4.5). Either\nway, though, and just as Samuelson insisted, Arrow\u2019s theorem does not\nlimit the single profile approach because one of its conditions is\ninappropriate in connection with it. Either U is\ninappropriate (if there is a single profile in the domain) or\nelse I is inappropriate (if there are no interprofile\nconstraints).\nCertain impossibility theorems that are closely related to Arrow\u2019s\nhave been thought relevant to single-profile choice even so. These\ntheorems do not use Arrow\u2019s interprofile condition \\(I\\) but\nuse instead an intraprofile neutrality condition. This\ncondition says that whenever within any single profile the\npattern of individual preferences for one pair \\(x\\),\\(y\\) of options is\nthe same as for another pair \\(z,w\\), the social ordering derived\nfrom this profile must also be the same for \\(x\\), \\(y\\) as it is for \\(z\\),\n\\(w\\):\n\nSingle-Profile Neutrality (SPN): For any \\(\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle\\), and any alternatives \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\) and \\(w\\): IF for all\n\\(i: xR_{i}y\\) if and only if \\(zR_{i}w\\), and \\(yR_{i}x\\) if and only if\n\\(wR_{i}z\\), THEN \\(x f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle y\\) if and only if \\(z f\\langle\nR_{i}\\rangle w\\), and \\(y f\\langle R_{i}\\rangle x\\) if and only if \\(w\nf\\langle R_{i}\\rangle z\\).\n\nSPN follows from the strong neutrality (SN)\ncondition of Section 4.5, on identifying\n\\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) with \\(\\langle R_{i}^*\\rangle\\). Parks (1976),\nand independently Kemp and Ng (1976), showed that there are\n\u201csingle profile\u201d versions of Arrow\u2019s theorem\nusing SPN instead of I. These theorems were\nsupposed to block the Bergson-Samuelson approach. In fact,\ncondition SPN is just as easily set aside as SN,\nand for the same reason: both exclude non-welfare information that is\nrelevant to the comparison of social states from an ethical\nstandpoint. Samuelson (1977) ridiculed SPN using an example\nabout redistributing chocolate. It is similar in structure to the\nexample of Peter and Paul, in\n Section 4.5.\n",
