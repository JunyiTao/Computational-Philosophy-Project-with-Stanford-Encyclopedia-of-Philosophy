    "main_text": "Evolution, Development, and Culture || Convergent Evolution\n1.1 Convergent Evolution\n\nThe evolution of wings is a paradigm case of convergent evolution.\nWings have the function of sustaining flight and have evolved in many\ndifferent organisms, including birds, bats, and insects. The\nstructures comprising wings differ across these groups\u2014bat wings\nconsist of extended digits, bird wings evolved from an extended\nforelimb, and insect wings are outgrowths of exoskeleton. Although\nwings in these groups differ in their underlying structures, they\nshare features like rigidity, which allow them to perform the same\nfunction\u2014producing lift and enabling flight. Similarities in\ntraits such as these can be explained in part by appealing to shared\nselection pressures.\n\nAdaptive considerations such at these guide theorizing in comparative\ncognition. In this case, a \u201cpsychological trait is treated as a\ndesign problem\u201d (Ereshefsky 2007: 670). One determines the\nfunction that a psychological trait serves and asks what selection\npressures might have led to that evolutionary outcome. For example,\nresearch on western scrub jays suggests that they have episodic-like\nmemory or the ability to remember the \u201cwhat, where, and\nwhen\u201d features of specific events (Clayton et al. 2001). Scrub\njays are \u201cscatter-hoarders\u201d, hiding food in multiple\nplaces for later recovery. Caching behavior such as this enables\nindividuals to survive in environments with fluctuating food supplies.\nWhen recovering their caches, scrub jays remember where and when they\nhave cached a specific food item. For example, they avoid searching\nfor perishable food (like a worm) if its window of freshness has\nelapsed (Clayton & Dickinson 1998). Recent work on cuttlefish\nsuggests that they face similar foraging challenges to\nscatter-hoarding birds. They live in environments with variable food\nsupplies and appear to keep track of what they have eaten, as well as\nwhere and when they ate (Jozet-Alves, Bertin, & Clayton 2013;\nSchnell, Clayton, et al. 2021a). Cuttlefish are cephalopod mollusks\nand diverged from vertebrates like scrub jays over 550 million years\nago\n (Figure 1).\n Given this phylogenetic distance, if cuttlefish and western scrub\njays share the capacity for episodic-like memory, this cognitive trait\nmay have evolved independently in these two taxa as a common solution\nto similar ecological problems.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Distantly related organisms\nmay share similar cognitive abilities because they face similar\nsocioecological selection pressures over evolutionary time. Image\nadapted from Schnell, Amodio, Boeckle, and Clayton (2021b: 4). [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAlexandra Schnell and colleagues argue that studying phylogenetically\ndistant species like chimpanzees, corvids, and cephalopods, allows\nresearchers to better understand the selection pressures that give\nrise to \u201ccomplex cognition\u201d like episodic-like memory,\nfuture planning, causal reasoning, and imagination (Schnell et al.\n2021b; see also van Horik et al. 2012, Powell et al. 2017, Amodio et\nal. 2019). For example, the Social Intelligence Hypothesis holds that\ncomplex cognition is a product of selection pressures that arise from\nliving in complex social groups (see Byrne & Whiten 1988).\nHowever, many cephalopods live short and solitary lives. If these\ncephalopods do have cognitive capacities such as causal reasoning,\nthese may have evolved in response to selective pressures emerging\nfrom something other than complex social environments. Focusing on\nsocially complex vertebrates like chimpanzees and corvids alone makes\nit \u201cdifficult to uncouple the effects of ecological and social\npressures on cognitive evolution\u201d (Schnell et al. 2021a: 172).\nIf it can be shown that organisms such as corvids and cephalopods\n(e.g., the octopus) have the same cognitive capacities (e.g., causal\nreasoning), then researchers might be better placed to infer the\nenvironmental demands that led to the emergence of adaptations in\nthese distantly related taxa.\n",
