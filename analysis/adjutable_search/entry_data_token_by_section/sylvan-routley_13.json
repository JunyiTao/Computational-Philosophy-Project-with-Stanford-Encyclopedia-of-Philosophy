    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Deep Green Ethics\n4.2 Deep Green Ethics\n\n\nWhile Sylvan views the development of deep ecology sympathetically, he\ndistances himself from the positions being argued for under that\nbanner. His own \u201cdeep green ethics\u201d is described most\nclearly in Sylvan and Bennett (1994, ch. 5). Like deep ecology, the\nposition is, using the term originally coined in Naess (1973),\n\u201cdeep\u201d since it rejects the sole value assumption and\ngreater value thesis. But unlike deep ecology Sylvan rejects, in\nparticular:\n\nbiocentrism\u2014\u201call and only life is valuable\u201d\n\n\n\narguing instead that some non-living things have intrinsic value and\nthat not all life is intrinsically valuable; and\n\nbiospherical egalitarianism\u2014\u201cthe equal value of all life\u201d\n\n\n\narguing instead for eco-impartiality, thus not valuing members of one\nspecies over those of another simply on the basis of species\nmembership, and noting that evaluative impartiality with respect to\nspecies does not entail their equal value. More generally, Sylvan\n(1985) argues that under the strong West Coast US influence deep\necology commits to an assortment of dubious metaphysical and\npsychological themes\u2014often leading to an anthropocentric\n\u201cperson- and consciousness-oriented souffl\u00e9\u201d. And\nlinks to religion, in particular pantheism and nature mysticism,\nthreaten to \u201cconvert deep ecology into a new religion\u201d.\nWhat results is a \u201cdeep ecology\u201d that is\n\u201cconceptually murky\u201d and subject to\n\u201cdegeneration\u201d. As noted in Section 1, laying out these\npoints of difference with deep ecologists in uncompromising style\nearned him the title \u2018the bad boy of deep ecology\u2019 (Orton\n2005, Other Internet Resources). For responses, see Fox (1986) and\nAttfield (1993).\n\n\nHis deep green theory is, following his metaphysical and logical\npluralism (cf. Sylvan 2000b), also pluralistic \u201callow[ing] for\nthe requisite theory dependence and cultural relativity of\nvalues\u201d (1980a, 156), \u201cthere is no uniquely determined\ncorrect value system \u2026 there are various overlapping\nsystems\u201d though he denies that ethical relativism follows from\nthis (Sylvan 1986, 13). He sees the ongoing cultural project of\ndeveloping an adequate environmental ethic as being in its early\nstages.\n\n\nGrey (2000) contends that the (proto)theory faces numerous problems;\nfor further analysis as to whether Sylvan\u2019s position has been\nproperly targeted see Lamb (2018, 565\u201380 passim).\n\n\nNot content with mere theory, as noted in section 1, Sylvan also\nengaged in ambitious practical conservation work, acquiring high-value\nconservation properties for rehabilitation and protection. But the\nvalue of such rehabilitated landscapes is contested in Elliot (1982)\nand Katz (1992). Defending the idea that naturalness of origin is a\nvaluable aspect of wild nature, they argue that not only is restored\nnature of lesser value than any wilderness that it replaces, but the\nrestored copy could be described as \u201ca fake or a forgery\u201d\n(Elliot 1982, 84); restoration involves a \u201cbig lie\u201d as\nKatz puts it. Sylvan thinks they have grossly overstated their case\nand responds in Sylvan (1994)\u2014restored landscapes are not mere\nartifact or fakery. They are not contrived gardens devoid of natural\nvalues, artificial nature falsely presented as the real thing.\n\n\nConsider an area of restored bushland \u2026 The restoration results\nprimarily by nature doing its own thing; it is nothing like furniture\nor pottery making. An ecological restorer, unlike an artisan, does not\nproduce the item, there is no making \u2026 Rather there is\nadjustment at margins \u2026 and there is helping in\nhealing (Sylvan 1994, 68).\n\n\nSylvan argues that Elliot and Katz have illicitly extended the notion\nof an artifact, which is widely and wrongfully deployed in such\ndescriptions of restored natural areas and what they (especially Katz)\nhave failed to grasp is the value-enhancing role that restoration\nplays in the many situations where the damage has already been\ndone. Such restoration \u201cis an addition, an attempt \u2026 to\nclaim back much more of what has [already] been grabbed and degraded\nor ruined\u201d (Ibid., 75). In many cases restoration\nassists nature in reasserting itself and taking control once\nmore. What results lacks certain properties of the original, to be\nsure, especially natural continuity, but contributing to the\nrestoration of something to close-to-original value (as opposed to\nsome low-value fake) is, Sylvan argues, worthwhile and can result in\nnear-natural areas of enormous value. That is value enough.\n\n\nThough Sylvan is uneasy using the term \u2018wilderness\u2019\n\u201cdue to its long history of unfavourable associations and\nconnotation\u201d, he agrees with the broader point being made by\nElliot and Katz\u2014\u201cecological restoration is not an\nalternative to retaining wilderness, to remnant wildernesses\u201d\n(Sylvan 1994, 75). However, they have overstated their case concerning\nthe value of restored landscapes. Elliot was persuaded, admitting that\nhe paid too little attention to the types of restoration that can be\nachieved and underestimated the value and degree of naturalness that\ncan result. In a book-length response to Sylvan and other critics and\nfellow travellers, Elliot (1997) clarifies his argument. Its Preface\nacknowledged the enormous debt to Sylvan. He is, Elliot came to think,\nquite right. \u201cMucking with nature\u201d can result in something\nof significant value and it is, Elliot argued, in many cases\nobligatory to try to undo the damage we have done.\n\n\nA further practical issue which Sylvan sees as requiring theoretical\njustification is predation: the killing of animals for\nfood. \u201cThe vegetarian options face, it certainly seems,\ninsuperable difficulties, especially concerning such issues as animal\npredation (which is an important, immensely frequent, and\noften desirable, ecological fact), and concerning the\nreduction in numbers of animals, especially introduced animals, which\nbuild up to \u2018pest proportions\u2019 (some reduction is often\nrequired for vegetable growing to operate successfully)\u201d\n(Routley 1982, 5). Sylvan himself, for example, culled feral rabbits\n(a damaging, introduced species in Australia) and he consumed the\nanimals killed. While his environmental ethic demands respect for\nintrinsically valuable non-humans, he argues that the\n\n\nrespect position is not a reverence position \u2026 interference is\nacceptable [in certain cases] \u2026 The lives, preferences,\nchoices, and considerations of other species or objects of moral\nconcern are not to be taken as sacred or inviolable [though we]\nrequire that good reasons be given for interfering with the\nenvironment (Sylvan and Bennett 1994, 149).\n\n\nSee Routley (1982, \u00a74) for a defence (a paper which also presents\na moral defence of limited cannibalism). For a similar view see\nCallicott (1980) and for defence of the contrary claim that we ought,\nwhere possible, act to eliminate predation, even cases of wild animals\ntaking prey for food, see Nussbaum (2007, ch. 6).\n",
