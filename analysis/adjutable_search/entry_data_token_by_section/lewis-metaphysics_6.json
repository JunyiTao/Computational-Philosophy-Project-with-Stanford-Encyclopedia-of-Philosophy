A complicated question; I will limit discussion to just two\nimportant worries. Let\u2019s begin by noting the obvious influence of\na certain scientifically-informed conception of the world in shaping\nLewis\u2019s picture of reality. Lewis himself is quite explicit about\nthis influence:\n\nThe picture is inspired by classical physics. Humean Supervenience\ndoesn\u2019t actually say that physics is right about what local\nqualities there are, but that\u2019s the case to keep in mind. But if\nwe keep physics in mind, we\u2019d better remember that physics\nisn\u2019t really classical. \u2026The point of defending Humean\nSupervenience is not to support reactionary physics, but rather to\nresist philosophical arguments that there are more things in heaven\nand earth than physics has dreamt of. (1994, p. 474)\n\n\nBut there is a less acknowledged influence of first-order predicate\nlogic\u2014an influence that is not entirely salutary. It is\nundoubtedly tempting, for philosophers steeped in the use of\nfirst-order logic as a clarifying tool, to assume that the proper\nrepresentation of the ultimate structure of reality must be by means\nof some (interpreted) first-order language\u2014a language whose\nvarious predicates could be taken to express the various\nfundamental properties and relations that characterize\nreality at its most basic level. But if we look to physics\ninstead\u2014as we surely ought to\u2014we find that the basic\nrepresentational tools are variables, that correspond to\nphysical magnitudes. Taking seriously the picture of\nfundamental ontology suggested by these representations turns out to\nmatter quite a bit: in particular, there are reasons to think that\nnone of the first three theses about natural properties and\nrelations\u2014that they are minimal, non-modal, and\nintrinsic\u2014is tenable without some modification. This\nissue\u2014which we will mostly pass over in what follows, except\nwhere it matters\u2014is explored in more detail in the\nsupplementary document on\n\nPhysical Magnitudes\n\n\nThe second significant source of concern about Lewis\u2019s conception\nof fundamental ontology is the role\u2014or rather lack\nthereof\u2014that modal notions have in it. This concern has\ntwo aspects. First, one might hold that some, at least, of the\nfundamental properties and relations that characterize reality have\nmodal aspects that are ontologically basic. Consider mass:\none might hold that it is metaphysically impossible for there to be a\nworld containing just two massive particles, accelerating away from\neach other\u2014and that this impossibility somehow flows from the\nnature of mass itself.\n\nSecond, one might hold that it is one thing to state a thesis\nconcerning what the fundamental structure of reality in fact\nhappens to be; but that it is another, separate matter to\nstate how reality could be. Indeed, most metaphysicians, I\nsuspect, take it to be just blindingly obvious that these are\nconceptually distinct tasks. Granted that one\u2019s views on what\nthere is, and what it is like, will have ramifications for one\u2019s\nviews on what there could be and what it could be\nlike (most obviously, because things could be the way they\nare; but there may be more interesting and subtle connections\nas well); still, the project of laying out the former views does not\nautomatically complete the project of laying out the\nlatter.\n\nOf course there is a sense in which Lewis agrees: he takes it as\nobvious, after all, that he must supply an account of modality. But\nthe strikingly reductionist character of that account shows that such\nagreement as there is is mighty thin.\n",
