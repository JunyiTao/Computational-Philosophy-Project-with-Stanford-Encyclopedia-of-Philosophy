    "main_text": "Descartes || Motion and Dynamics\n3.2 Motion and Dynamics\n\nThere is an interpretational tradition which holds that Descartes only\ntook the first, \u2018ordinary\u2019 sense of motion seriously, and\nintroduced the second notion to avoid conflict with the Catholic\nChurch. Such conflict was a real concern, since the censure of\nGalileo\u2019s Copernicanism took place only 11 years before\npublication of the Principles, and had in fact dissuaded\nDescartes from publishing an earlier work, The World. Indeed,\nin the Principles (III.28) he is at pains to explain how\n\u2018properly speaking\u2019 the Earth does not move, because it is\nswept around the Sun in a giant vortex of matter \u2013 the Earth\ndoes not move relative to its surroundings in the vortex.\n\nThe difficulty with the reading, aside from the imputation of\ncowardice to the old soldier, is that it makes nonsense of\nDescartes\u2019 mechanics, a theory of collisions. For instance,\naccording to his laws of collision if two equal bodies strike each\nother at equal and opposite velocities then they will bounce off at\nequal and opposite velocities (Rule I). On the other hand, if the very\nsame bodies approach each other with the very same relative\nspeed, but at different speeds then they will move off together in the\ndirection of the faster one (Rule III). But if the operative meaning\nof motion in the Rules is the ordinary sense, then these two\nsituations are just the same situation, differing only in the choice\nof reference frame, and so could not have different outcomes \u2013\nbouncing apart versus moving off together. It seems\ninconceivable that Descartes could have been confused in such a\ntrivial\n way.[3]\n\nThus Garber (1992, Chapter 6\u20138) proposes that Descartes actually\ntook the unequivocal notion of motion properly speaking to be the\ncorrect sense of motion in mechanics. Then Rule I covers the case in\nwhich the two bodies have equal and opposite motions relative to\ntheir contiguous surroundings, while Rule VI covers the case in\nwhich the bodies have different motions relative to those\nsurroundings \u2013 one is perhaps at rest in its surroundings.\nThat is, exactly what is needed to make the rules consistent is the\nkind of privileged, true, sense of motion provided by Descartes\u2019\nsecond definition. Insurmountable problems with the rules remain, but\nrejecting the traditional interpretation and taking motion properly\nspeaking seriously in Descartes\u2019 philosophy clearly gives a more\ncharitable reading.\n",
