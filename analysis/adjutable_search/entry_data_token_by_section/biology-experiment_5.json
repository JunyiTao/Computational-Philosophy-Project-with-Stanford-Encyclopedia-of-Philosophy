    "main_text": "Experimental Systems and Model Organisms\n3. Experimental Systems and Model Organisms\n\nThe last two sections have treated experiments primarily as ways of\ntesting theoretical hypotheses and causal claims, which is where\ntraditional philosophy of science saw their principal role. However,\nthere exists a considerable body of scholarship in the history and\nphilosophy of biology that shows that this does not exhaust the role\nof experiments in biology. Experimentation, to echo Ian Hacking\u2019s\nfamous slogan, \u201chas a life of its own\u201d (Hacking 1983).\nMuch that goes on in a biological laboratory does not have the goal of\ntesting a preconceived theory. For example, many experiments play an\nexploratory role, that is, they assist scientists in\ndiscovering new phenomena about which they may not yet have any\ntheoretical account or not even any clear ideas. Exploratory\nexperimentation has been investigated in the history and philosophy of\nphysics (Steinle 1997) as well as biology (Burian 1997, 2007; O\u2019Malley\n2007; Waters 2007). These studies show that the development of any\ndiscipline in experimental biology cannot be understood by focusing on\ntheories and attempts to confirm or refute these theories.\nExperimental practice is simply not organized around theories,\nparticularly not in biology. If this is so, we must ask in what other\nterms this practice can be explained or reconstructed. Recent\nscholarship has focused in particular on two kinds of entities:\nmodel organisms and experimental systems.\n",
