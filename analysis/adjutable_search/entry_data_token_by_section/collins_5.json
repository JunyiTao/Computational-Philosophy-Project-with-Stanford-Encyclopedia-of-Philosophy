    "main_text": "Determinism and Free Will || Background\n3.1 Background\n\nCollins deals in passing with determinism and freedom of the will in\nthe 1707\u201308 correspondence with Samuel Clarke and in his 1707\nbook An Essay concerning the Use of Reason. His A\nPhilosophical Inquiry Concerning Liberty of 1717 is entirely\ndevoted to the issue. From the beginning, Collins is a determinist\nwith a compatibilist account of free action (Clarke 1738 [1928: 872];\nClarke and Collins: 226\u2013227). Clarke attacked Collins\u2019\ndeterminism in the 1707\u201308 correspondence. He also reviewed the\n1717 book and defended a doctrine of libertarian free will as he had\nin the earlier correspondence.\n\nSince the nature of human choices and actions are central to debates\nabout free will and determinism there is a close connection between\npositions about these issues and positions about consciousness and\npersonal identity. The kind of determinism that Collins advocates is a\nnatural extension of his materialist, empirical, and naturalistic\naccount of consciousness. In his account of consciousness, Collins\nmakes the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain the most basic\nmotives of action. This makes happiness and misery necessary\nconcomitants of consciousness, and thus conscious beings are endowed\nwith a desire for happiness. This is true as much of animals as it is\nof human beings and accounts for a large number of similarities in the\nbehavior of humans and animals. Collins holds that if the behavior of\nanimals is determined, then that of humans must be as well. \n",
