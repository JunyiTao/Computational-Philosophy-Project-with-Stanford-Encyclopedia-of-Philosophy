    "main_text": "Common sense\n8. Common sense\n\nCampbell was a leading member of the school of common sense\nphilosophy. For him common sense is an original source of knowledge\ncommon to humankind, by which we are assured of a number of truths\nthat cannot be evinced by reason and \u201cit is equally impossible,\nwithout a full conviction of them, to advance a single step in the\nacquisition of knowledge\u201d (Philosophy of Rhetoric, vol.\n1, p. 114). His account is much in line with that of his colleague\nJames Beattie: \u201cthat power of the mind which perceives truth, or\ncommands belief, not by progressive argumentation, but by an\ninstantaneous, instinctive, and irresistible impulse; derived neither\nfrom education nor from habit, but from nature; acting independently\non our will, whenever its object is presented, according to an\nestablished law, and therefore properly called Sense; and acting in a\nsimilar manner upon all, or at least upon a great majority of mankind,\nand therefore properly called Common Sense\u201d (An\nEssay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, p. 40). We are\nplainly in the same territory as Reid\u2019s account: \u201cthere\nare principles common to [philosophers and the vulgar], which need no\nproof, and which do not admit of direct proof\u201d, and these common\nprinciples \u201care the foundation of all reasoning and\nscience\u201d (Reid [EIP]).\n\nThese philosophers do however disagree about substantive matters. In\nparticular, Reid lists as the first principle of common sense:\n\u201cThe operations of our minds are attended with consciousness;\nand this consciousness is the evidence, the only evidence which we\nhave or can have of their existence\u201d (Reid [EIP], p. 41).\nCampbell on the other hand lists three sorts of intuitive evidence.\nThe first concerns our unmediated insight into the truth of\nmathematical axioms and the third concerns common sense principles.\nThe second concerns the deliverances of consciousness, consciousness\nbeing the faculty through which we learn directly of the occurrence of\nmental acts \u2014 thinking, remembering, being in pain, and so on.\nWhat is listed as a principle of common sense by Reid is, therefore,\naccording to Campbell, to be contrasted with such principles. Aside\nfrom this, however, it is clear that Campbell is philosophically very\nclose to Reid, even if Reid is unquestionably the greater\nphilosopher.\n",
