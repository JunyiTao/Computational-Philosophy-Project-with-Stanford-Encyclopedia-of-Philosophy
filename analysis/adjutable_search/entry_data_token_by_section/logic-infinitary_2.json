    "main_text": "The Compactness Property\n3. The Compactness Property\n\n\nAs we have seen, the compactness theorem in its usual form fails for\nall infinitary languages. Nevertheless, it is of some interest to\ndetermine whether infinitary languages satisfy some suitably modified\nversion of the theorem. This so-called compactness problem\nturns out to have a natural connection with purely set-theoretic\nquestions involving \u201clarge\u201d cardinal numbers. \n\n\nWe construct the following definition. Let \u03ba be an infinite\ncardinal. A language L is said to be\n\u03ba-compact (resp. weakly\n\u03ba-compact) if whenever \u0394 is a set of\nL-sentences (resp. a set of\nL-sentences of cardinality \u2264 \u03ba) and each\nsubset of \u0394 of cardinality < \u03ba has a model, so does\n\u0394. Notice that the usual compactness theorem for\n L\n is precisely the assertion that\n L is \u03c9-compact. One reason for\n according significance to the \u03ba-compactness property is the\n following. Call L \u03ba-complete\n (resp. weakly \u03ba-complete) if there is a\n deductive system\nP for L with deductions of\nlength < \u03ba such that, if \u0394 is a\nP-consistent[4]\n set of\nL-sentences (resp. such that |\u0394| \u2264 \u03ba),\nthen \u0394 has a model. Observe that such a\nP will be adequate for deductions from\narbitrary sets of premises (of cardinality \u2264 \u03ba) in the sense\nof \u00a72. It is easily seen that if L is\n\u03ba-complete or weakly \u03ba-complete, then L is\n\u03ba-compact or weakly \u03ba-compact. Thus, if we can show that a\ngiven language is not (weakly) \u03ba-compact, then there can\nbe no deductive system for it with deductions of length < \u03ba\nadequate for deductions from arbitrary sets of premises (of cardinality\n\u2264 \u03ba).\n\n\nIt turns out, in fact, that most languages\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n fail to be even weakly\n\u03ba-compact, and, for those that are, \u03ba must be an\nexceedingly large cardinal. We shall need some\ndefinitions.\n\n\nAn infinite cardinal \u03ba is said to be weakly\ninaccessible if\n\n\n(a) \u03bb < \u03ba \u2192 \u03bb+ <\n\u03ba, (where \u03bb+ denotes the cardinal successor of\n\u03bb), and \n\n(b) |\u2009I\u2009| < \u03ba and \u03bbi <\n\u03ba (for all i \u2208 I) \u21d2\n\u2211i\u2208I\n\u03bbi < \u03ba.\n\n\n\nIf in addition \n\n\n(c) \u03bb < \u03ba \u21d2 2\u03bb <\n\u03ba,\n\n\n\n\nthen \u03ba is said to be (strongly)inaccessible.\nSince\n \u21350 is inaccessible,\nit is normal practice to confine attention to those inaccessible, or\nweakly inaccessible, cardinals that exceed\n \u21350. Accordingly, inaccessible or weakly\ninaccessible cardinals will always be taken to be uncountable.\nIt is clear that such cardinals\u2014if they exist\u2014must be\nextremely large; and indeed the G\u00f6del incompleteness theorem\nimplies that the existence of even weakly inaccessible cardinals cannot\nbe proved from the usual axioms of set theory. \n\n\nLet us call a cardinal \u03ba compact (resp. weakly\ncompact) if the language\n L(\u03ba,\u03ba)\n is \u03ba-compact (resp. weakly\n\u03ba-compact). Then we have the following results:\n(3.1)\n \u21350\nis compact. This is, of course, just a succinct way of\nexpressing the compactness theorem for first-order languages. \n\n\n\n(3.2) \u03ba is weakly compact \u21d2\n L(\u03ba,\u03c9)\n is weakly\n\u03ba-compact \u21d2 \u03ba is weakly\ninaccessible. Accordingly, it is consistent (with the usual axioms\nof set theory) to assume that no language\n L(\u03ba,\u03c9)\n with \u03ba \u2265 \u03c91\nis weakly \u03ba-compact, or, a fortiori, weakly\n\u03ba-complete.\n\n\n(3.3) Suppose \u03ba is inaccessible. Then \u03ba is weakly\ncompact \u00a0\u21d4\u00a0\n L(\u03ba,\u03c9)\n is weakly\n\u03ba-compact. Also, Also \u03ba is weakly compact \u21d2\nthere is a set of \u03ba inaccessibles before\n\u03ba. Thus a weakly compact inaccessible cardinal is exceedingly\nlarge; in particular it cannot be the first, second, \u2026,\nnth, \u2026 inaccessible.\n\n\n(3.4) \u03ba is compact \u21d2 \u03ba is\ninaccessible. (But, by the result immediately above, the converse\nfails.)\n\n\n\nLet Constr stand for G\u00f6del's axiom of\nconstructibility; recall that Constr is consistent\nwith the usual axioms of set theory. \n(3.5) If Constr holds, then\nthere are no compact cardinals. \n\n\n\n(3.6) Assume Constr and let\n\u03ba be inaccessible. Then \u03ba is weakly\ncompact \u21d4\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) is weakly\n\u03ba-compact for all\nL.\n\n\n(3.7) If Constr holds, then there are\nno cardinals \u03ba for which\nL(\u03c91,\u03c9) is compact.\nAccordingly, it is consistent with the usual axioms of set theory to\nsuppose that there is no cardinal \u03ba such that all languages\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) are\n\u03ba-complete. This result is to be contrasted with the fact that\nall first-order languages are \u03c9-complete.\n\n\n\nThe import of these results is that the compactness theorem fails\nvery badly for most languages\n L(\u03ba,\u03bb)\n with \u03ba \u2265\n\u03c91.\n\n\nSome historical remarks are in order here. In the 1930s\nmathematicians investigated various versions of the so-called\nmeasure problem for sets, a problem which arose in connection\nwith the theory of Lebesgue measure on the continuum. In particular,\nthe following very simple notion of measure was formulated. If\nX is a set, a (countably additive two-valued nontrivial)\nmeasure on X is a map \u03bc on the power set\nPX to the set {0, 1} satisfying:\n(a) \u03bc(X) = 1, \n\n\n\n(b) \u03bc({x}) = \u03bc(\u2205) = 0 for all x\n\u2208X, and\n\n\n(c) if A is any countable family of\nmutually disjoint subsets of X, then\n \u03bc(\u222aA) =\n\u2211{\u03bc(Y) : Y \u2208\nA}.\n\n\n\nObviously, whether a given set supports such a measure depends only\non its cardinality, so it is natural to define a cardinal \u03ba to be\nmeasurable if all sets of cardinality \u03ba support a\nmeasure of this sort. It was quickly realized that a measurable\ncardinal must be inaccessible, but the falsity of the converse was not\nestablished until the 1960s when Tarski showed that measurable\ncardinals are weakly compact and his student Hanf showed that the\nfirst, second, etc. inaccessibles are not weakly compact (cf. (3.3)).\nAlthough the conclusion that measurable cardinals must be monstrously\nlarge is now normally proved without making the detour through weak\ncompactness and infinitary languages, the fact remains that these ideas\nwere used to establish the result in the first instance.\n",
