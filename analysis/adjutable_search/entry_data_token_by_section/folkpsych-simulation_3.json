    "main_text": "What is Meant by \u201cMental Simulation\u201d? || Mental Simulation as Reuse\n2.2 Mental Simulation as Reuse\n\nClearly,\n RES-2\n is a better definition of \u201cmental simulation of\u201d than\n RES-1.\n Hurley (2008), however, argued that it won\u2019t do either, since\nit fails to distinguish ST from its main competitor, i.e., the\nTheory-Theory (TT), according to which mindreading depends on a body\nof information about mental states and processes\n (section 5).\n The crux of Hurley\u2019s argument is this. Suppose that a token\nvisual image V* resembles a token visual experience V\nand, in doing so, fulfils one of its functions. In this case,\n RES-2\n is satisfied. But now suppose further that visualization works like a\ncomputer simulation: it generates its outputs on the basis of a body\nof information about vision. On this assumption,\n RES-2\n still categorizes V* as a mental simulation of V,\neven though V* has been generated by exactly the kind of\nprocess described by TT: a theory-driven and information-rich\nprocess.\n\nAccording to Hurley (who follows here a suggestion by Currie &\nRavenscroft 2002), the solution to this difficulty lies in the\nrealization that \u201cthe fundamental \u2026 concept of simulation\nis reuse, not resemblance\u201d (Hurley 2008: 758, emphasis\nadded). Hurley\u2019s reuse-based definition of \u201cmental\nsimulation of\u201d can be articulated as follows:\n\n\n(REU) Token state M* is a mental simulation of token state\nM if and only if:\n\n Both M and M* are mental states\n M is generated by token cognitive process P\n M* is generated by token cognitive process P*\n P is implemented by the use of a token cognitive\nmechanism of type C\n P* is implemented by the reuse of a token\ncognitive mechanism of type C\n\n\n\nTo have a full understanding of REU, we need to answer three\nquestions: (a) What is a cognitive process? (b) What is a\ncognitive mechanism? (c) What is the difference between\nusing and reusing a certain cognitive mechanism?\nLet\u2019s do it!\n\nIt is a commonplace that explanation in cognitive science is\nstructured into different levels. Given our aims, we can illustrate\nthis idea through the classical tri-level hypothesis\nformulated by David Marr (1982). Suppose that one wants to explain a\ncertain cognitive capacity, say, vision (or mindreading, or\nmoral judgment). The first level of explanation, the most abstract\none, consists in describing what the cognitive capacity\ndoes\u2014what task it performs, what problem it solves, what\nfunction it computes. For example, the task performed by vision is\nroughly \u201cto derive properties of the world from images of\nit\u201d (Marr 1982: 23). The second level of analysis specifies\nhow the task is accomplished: what algorithm our mind uses to\ncompute the function. Importantly, this level of analysis abstracts\nfrom the particular physical structures that implement the algorithm\nin our head. It is only at the third level of analysis that the\ndetails of the physical implementation of the algorithm in\nour brain are spelled out.\n\nWith these distinctions at hand, we can answer questions (a) and (b).\nA cognitive process is a cognitive capacity considered as an\ninformation-processing activity and taken in abstraction from its\nphysical implementation. Thus, cognitive processes are individuated in\nterms of what function they perform and/or in terms of what algorithms\ncompute these functions (fair enough, the \u201cand/or\u201d is a\nvery big deal, but it is something we can leave aside here). This\nmeans that the same (type of) cognitive process can be multiply\nrealized in different physical structures. For example, parsing\n(roughly, the cognitive process that assigns a grammatical structure\nto a string of signs) can be implemented both by a human brain and a\ncomputer. On the contrary, cognitive mechanisms are\nparticular (types of) physical structures\u2014e.g., a certain part\nof the brain\u2014implementing certain cognitive processes. More\nprecisely, cognitive mechanisms are organized structures carrying out\ncognitive processes in virtue of how their constituent parts interact\n(Bechtel 2008; Craver 2007; Machamer et al. 2000).\n\nWe now turn to question (c), which concerns the distinction between\nuse and reuse of a cognitive mechanism. At a first approximation, a\ncognitive mechanism is used when it performs its primary\nfunction, while it is reused when it is activated to perform\na different, non-primary function. For example, one is using\none\u2019s visual mechanism when one employs it to see, while one is\nreusing it when one employs it to conjure up a visual image\n(see Anderson 2008, 2015 for further discussion of the notion of\nreuse). All this is a bit sketchy, but it will do.\n\nLet\u2019s now go back to\n REU.\n The main idea behind it is that whether a mental state is a mental\nsimulation of another mental state depends on the cognitive\nprocesses generating these two mental states, and on the\ncognitive mechanisms implementing such cognitive processes.\nMore precisely, in order for mental state M* to be a mental\nsimulation of mental state M, it has to be case that:\n(i) cognitive processes P* and P, which\nrespectively generate M* and M, are both implemented by\nthe same (type of) cognitive mechanism C; (ii) P is\nimplemented by the use of C, while P* is\nimplemented by the reuse of C. \n\nNow that we know what\n REU\n means, we can consider whether it fares better than\n RES-2\n in capturing the nature of the relation of mental simulation. It\nwould seem so. Consider this hypothetical scenario. Lisa is seeing a\nyellow banana, and her visual experience has been generated by\ncognitive process V1, which has been implemented by\nthe use of her visual mechanism. I am visualizing a yellow banana, and\nmy visual image has been generated by cognitive process\nV2, which has been implemented by the reuse of my\nvisual mechanism. Rosanna-the-Super-Reasoner is also visualizing a\nyellow banana, but her visual image has been generated by an\ninformation-rich cognitive process: a process drawing upon\nRosanna\u2019s detailed knowledge of vision and implemented by her\nincredibly powerful reasoning mechanism.\n REU\n correctly predicts that my visual image is a mental simulation of\nLisa\u2019s visual experience, but not vice versa. More importantly,\nit also predicts that Rosanna\u2019s visual image does not count as a\nmental simulation of Lisa\u2019s visual experience, given that\nRosanna\u2019s cognitive process was not implemented by the reuse of\nthe visual mechanism. In this way,\n REU\n solves the problem faced by\n RES-2\n in distinguishing ST from TT.\n\nShould we then conclude that \u201cmental simulation of\u201d has to\nbe defined in terms of reuse, rather than in terms of resemblance?\nGoldman (2008a) is still not convinced. Suppose that while Lisa is\nseeing a yellow banana, I am using my visual mechanism to visualize\nthe Golden Gate Bridge. Now, even though Lisa\u2019s visual\nexperience and my visual image have been respectively generated by the\nuse and the reuse of the visual mechanism, it would be bizarre to say\nthat my mental state is a mental simulation of Lisa\u2019s. Why?\nBecause my mental state doesn\u2019t resemble Lisa\u2019s (she is\nseeing a yellow banana; I am visualizing the Golden Gate Bridge!)\nThus\u2014Goldman concludes\u2014resemblance should be taken as\nthe central feature of mental simulation.\n",
