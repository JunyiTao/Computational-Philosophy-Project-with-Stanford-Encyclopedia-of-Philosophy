    "main_text": "Khayyam the Mathematician and Scientist || Solutions of Cubic Equations\n4.1 Solutions of Cubic Equations\nKhayyam seems to have been attracted to cubic equations originally through his consideration of the following geometric problem: in a quadrant of a circle, drop a perpendicular from some point on the circumference to one of the radii so that the ratio of the perpendicular to the radius is equal to the ratio of the two parts of the radius on which the perpendicular falls. In the short \u201cTreatise on the division of a quadrant of a circle,\u201d Khayyam leads us from one case of this problem to the equation \\(x^3 + 200x = 20x^2 + 2000\\).[11] Khayyam states that an exact solution is not possible and provides an approximation. Khayyam also generates a direct geometric solution: he uses the numbers in the equation to determine intersecting curves of two conic sections (a circle and a hyperbola) and demonstrates that the solution \\(x\\) is equal to the length of a particular line segment in the diagram.\nSolving algebraic problems using geometric tools was not new; in the case of quadratic equations these geometric methods date back as far as the Greeks and even to the Babylonians. Khayyam\u2019s predecessors such as al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (early 9th century) and Th\u0101bit ibn Qurra (late 9th century) already had solved quadratic equations using the straightedge and compass geometry of Euclid\u2019s Elements. Since negative numbers were avoided in Arabic mathematics, Muslim mathematicians needed to solve several different types of quadratic equations with positive coefficients: for instance, \\(x^2 = mx + n\\) was fundamentally different from \\(x^2 + mx = n\\). For cubic equations, fourteen distinct types of equations cannot be reduced to a linear or quadratic form after dividing by \\(x\\) or \\(x^2\\). In his \u201cTreatise on Algebra\u201d[12] Khayyam notes that four of these fourteen types had been solved and says that al-Kh\u0101zin (ca. 900\u2013971) had solved a problem from Archimedes\u2019 treatise On the Sphere and Cylinder that al-M\u0101h\u0101n\u012b (fl. ca. 860) had previously converted into a cubic equation and solved using conic sections. Khayyam also states that al-Layth (fl. 10th century) had not treated these cubic forms exhaustively.\nIn the Algebra, Khayyam claims to be the first to deal systematically with all fourteen types of cubic equations. He solves each one in turn, again through the use of intersecting conic sections. Khayyam also considers circumstances when certain cubic equations have multiple solutions. Although he does not handle this topic perfectly, his effort nonetheless exceeds previous efforts. In an algebra where powers of \\(x\\) corresponded to geometrical dimensions, the solution of cubic equations was the apex of the discipline. Nevertheless, even here Khayyam advanced algebra by considering its unknowns as dimension-free abstractions of continuous quantities.[13]\nA geometric solution to a polynomial equation may seem peculiar to modern eyes, but the study of cubic equations (and indeed much of medieval algebra) was motivated by geometric problems. Khayyam was explicitly aware that the algebraic solution of the cubic equation remained to be solved. He never produced such a solution, nor did anyone else until Scipione del Ferro, Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia, and Gerolamo Cardano in the mid-16th century.\nKhayyam\u2019s work intersecting algebra and geometry is a precursor to the analytic geometry popularized in Descartes\u2019 La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie published in 1637. Descartes\u2019 La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie refines and generalizes Khayyam\u2019s methods and forms a bridge from the medieval mathematics of Khayyam to the modern mathematics of Newton and Leibniz (Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000, 20\u201329).\n",
