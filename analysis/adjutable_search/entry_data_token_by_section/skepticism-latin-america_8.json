    "main_text": "History of ancient skepticism\n9. Skepticism and literature\n\nPerhaps it should also be mentioned some other studies on the history\nof skepticism. On the one hand, there are some literary studies.\nMachado de Assis, one of the best Brazilian writers, has been seen as\na skeptic by many people. One reason is that Machado read and used\nextensively Montaigne\u2019s skepticism. Jos\u00e9 Raimundo de Maia\nNeto (1994) published a book on the topic. The novelty of his book is\nthat it was the first discussion on Machado\u2019s skepticism based\non the history of skepticism. Paulo Roberto Margutti Pinto (2007) and\nGustavo Bernardo Krause (2007a) discussed Maia Neto\u2019s\ninterpretation, and Maia Neto replied to them. Krause is a Brazilian\nnovelist as well as a professor of literature who published many books\nand papers on skepticism and literature (Krause 2004), on Machado\n(Krause 2006) and other writers such as the well-known Brazilian poet\nCarlos Drummond de Andrade (Krause 2007b). On the other hand, Paulo\nRoberto Margutti Pinto has been studying the history of Brazilian\nphilosophy, in which he sees an important role for skepticism long\nbefore Porchat brought it to center stage. In Pinto 2010, he argues\nfor the influence of Francisco Sanches on Brazilian colonial thought.\nOne of the reasons for Porchat\u2019s success is that it seems that\nBrazilian thought has always had, at least in some places, a tendency\ntowards skepticism. Machado de Assis would not be an exception.\n",
