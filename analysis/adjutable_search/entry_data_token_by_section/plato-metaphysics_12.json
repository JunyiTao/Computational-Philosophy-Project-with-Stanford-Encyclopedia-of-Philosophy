    "main_text": "Sun, Line and Cave\n13. Sun, Line and Cave\n\n\nThe argument at the end of Book Five is a prelude to the argument and\nanalogies of Sun, Line and Cave in Books Six and Seven. The point of\nSun is to contrast the visible and intelligible realms. The former is\ngenerated, nurtured and governed by the sun, which also provides the\nlight required by the eye to gain access to the physical world.\nCorresponding to the sun in the intelligible realm is the Good:\n\u201cWhat gives truth to the things known and the power to know to\nthe knower is the Form of the Good. And though it is the cause of\nknowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge.\u201d (508e).\nIndeed, the Good is responsible for the very \u2018being\u2019 of\nthe knowable objects, though Plato never says in what sense the Good\nis responsible for the knowability and being of the objects of\nknowledge (see Santas 1980).\n\n\nLine starts from the broad division stipulated by Sun: there is the\nintelligible realm and the visible realm. Each of these is again\ndivided into two (unequal) parts. At the bottom of the visible one\nfinds images, shadows and such. The ordinary physical objects of which\nthe images are images occupy the upper portion. Set over the images is\nthe faculty of eikasia, imagination. Set over the physical\nworld is the faculty of pistis, literally faith or conviction,\nbut generally regarded as belief. Plato next turns to the lower segment\nof the intelligible portion of Line:\nIn (this) subsection, the soul, using as images the things\nthat were imitated before, is forced to investigate from hypotheses,\nproceeding not to a first principle, but to a conclusion. In the other\nsubsection, however, it makes its way to a first principle that is not\na hypothesis, proceeding from a hypothesis, but without the images used\nin the previous subsection, using Forms themselves and making its\ninvestigation through them (510b).\n\n\nThe top-most segment of Line is clear enough. The objects are Forms\nand the faculty set over Forms is Nous, Knowledge or Understanding.\nIncluded in this group is the Good itself, best regarded as having the\nstatus of first among equals. Precisely what to make of the objects in\nthe third section, the faculty of dianoia, and the nature of\nhypotheses are matters of great controversy. Given Plato's examples,\nthe capacity of dianoia seems distinctive of scientific or\nmathematical reasoning. (On the question of hypotheses and the\nrelation of this passage to the hypothetical method of\nthe Phaedo, see \u00a715 supra.) The objects\nof dianoia are then, roughly, the objects of the\nsciences. There appear to be two basic approaches to the\n\u2018objects\u2019 of dianoia, depending on how one\nunderstands the participial phrase \u201cusing as images the things\nthat were imitated before\u201d: 1) The objects of this segment are\nsome kind of \u2018abstract\u2019 image of ordinary material things\n- a kind of image different from the kind that are shadows and\nreflections; or 2) the objects are either the material objects\nthemselves though now treated (abverbially, as it were) in a special,\ndifferent way, or they are Forms, though treated in a way different\nfrom that way in which no\u00fbs treats Forms (see Burnyeat\n1987).\n\n\nCave, arguably the most famous analogy in the history of philosophy,\nreinforces the message of line. Seated prisoners, chained so that they\ncannot move their heads, stare at a cave wall on which are projected\nimages. These images are cast from carved figures illuminated by a fire\nand carried by people on a parapet above and behind the prisoners. A\nprisoner is loosed from his chains. First he sees the carved images and\nthe fire. Then he is led out of the cave into \u2018the real\u2019 world.\nBlinded by the light of the sun, he cannot look at the trees, rocks and\nanimals around him, but instead looks at the shadows and reflections\n(in water) cast by those objects. As he becomes acclimatized, he turns\nhis gaze to those objects and finally, fully acclimatized, he looks to\nthe source of illumination, the sun itself.\n\n\nIn the analogy of Cave, corresponding to the physical objects over\nwhich belief is set are the carved statues in the cave. Corresponding\nto the \u2018using as images what before were imitated\u2019 are the\nreflections in the pond. If, however, Cave is our guide, these\ndematerialized images are generated not from the carved statues but\nfrom the animals, i.e., the Forms themselves.\n",
