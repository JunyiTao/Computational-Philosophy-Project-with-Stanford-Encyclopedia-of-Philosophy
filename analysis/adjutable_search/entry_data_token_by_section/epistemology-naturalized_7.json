    "main_text": "Critical Reactions to Quine || Some responses, and further clarification of the issues\n3.2 Some responses, and further clarification of the issues\n\nVarious responses to the preceding objections have been suggested.\nAddressing the first will give us occasion to clarify typical current\nnaturalists\u2019 motivations, as well as\u2014and\nrelatedly\u2014to get a better sense of what is, and is not, central\nto NE. Addressing the fourth and fifth will carry us beyond Quine and\ninto the heart of current disagreements with, and within, NE.\n\n(1) Recall, first, the non sequitur\nobjection, according to which Quine falsely equates TE with Cartesian\nepistemology. One response is that Quine\u2019s arguments\nsurvive\u2014at least in spirit\u2014the recognition that many\nepistemologists had/have already moved away from infallibilistic\nrequirements on foundational beliefs, and that even in its more\nlenient forms, \u201c[f]oundationalism has simply failed to deliver\nthe goods\u201d (Kornblith 1995: 238). For the looser we make the\nrequirements on justified beliefs in answer to our pretheoretic\nintuitions, the less we\u2019re learning about knowledge, the less\nwe\u2019re seriously engaged with answering the skeptic, and the less\nwe stand to gain any substantial epistemic advice (beyond, \u201ckeep\nbelieving more or less what you already believed\u201d) (1995: 239).\nSo foundationalism, in whatever form, \u201cis an idea which [has]\nsimply failed to work out\u201d (1995:\n 239).[9]\n\nA different line of response to the non sequitur objection is\nsimply to grant the point, but observe that, Quine\u2019s arguments\nnotwithstanding, more recent naturalists have not been motivated by\nthe failure of Cartesian epistemology. Rather, they have\nsought to find an alternative to what was seen as a stagnating or\notherwise unsatisfactory traditional approach. For instance, failed\nattempts to solve the Gettier problem by requiring more, and more\nsubtle, logical relations among propositions, seemed to ignore the\nfact that, unless the subject\u2019s psychology aligns with the\nsuggested requirements, the proposed analysis will fail (Kitcher 1992:\n59\u201360). Thus, Goldman\u2019s early causal theory of\nknowing\u2014an early appearance of NE in the aforementioned Roth\n& Galis volume\u2014was expressly presented as an alternative\nto\n\n\na well-established tradition in epistemology, the view that\nepistemological questions are questions of logic or justification, not\ncausal or genetic questions. (Goldman 1967: 82)\n\n\nAlong the same lines, when, at the end of his \u201cDiscrimination\nand Perceptual Knowledge\u201d, Goldman contrasts his approach with\nthat of Descartes, it\u2019s not the latter\u2019s infallibilism\nthat gets special attention, but rather issues of a broadly\nexplanatory-methodological nature:\n\n\nThe trouble with many philosophical treatments of knowledge is that\nthey are inspired by Cartesian-like conceptions of justification or\nvindication. There is a consequent tendency to overintellectualize or\noverrationalize the notion of knowledge. In the spirit of naturalistic\nepistemology, I am trying to fashion an account of knowing that\nfocuses on more primitive and pervasive aspects of cognitive life, in\nconnection with which, I believe, the term \u201cknow\u201d gets its\napplication. A fundamental facet of animate life, both human and\ninfra-human, is telling things apart, distinguishing predator from\nprey, for example, or a protective habitat from a threatening one. The\nconcept of knowledge has its roots in this kind of cognitive activity.\n(Goldman 1976: 102)\n\n\nOther naturalistic treatments of knowledge were similarly motivated.\nFor instance, Dretske\u2019s (1981) information-theoretic account was\nan attempt to move beyond justification-centered accounts of\nknowledge\u2014accounts which took it for granted that knowledge\nrequired justification, the task then being to find what special\ncombination of other ingredients must be added to yield knowledge.\nAccording to Dretske, such an approach faces \u201ca variety of\ncrippling objections\u201d (1981: 85). In addition, \u201c[t]he\nconcept of justification (or some related epistemic notion)\nis often taken to be primitive\u201d, with theorists using\n\n\nfirmer intuitions about when, and whether, someone knows something to\ndetermine when, and whether, someone has a satisfactory level of\njustification. (1981: 249)\n\n\nFinally, like Goldman, Dretske associates justificationist accounts of\nknowledge with a tendency to over-intellectualize epistemic phenomena,\nto focus on \u201cfancier\u201d cases of knowing, cases which bring\nin (what he sees as) extraneous factors. The result is that the\ntheorist is left having to reject some very clear cases of\nknowledge\u2014in children, non-human animals, and unreflective\nadults\u2014as not genuine knowledge at all (Dretske 1991). His own\naccount of knowledge,\n\n\nis an attempt to get away from the philosopher\u2019s usual bag of tricks\n(justification, reasons, evidence, etc.) in order to give a more\nrealistic picture of what perceptual knowledge is. (1983: 58)\n\n\nThe same kind of broad methodological concerns are evident as well in\nnaturalistic accounts of justification (warrant, etc.), rather than\nknowledge. Goldman\u2019s reliabilism about justification (1979), for\nexample, has among its starting points a critique of\n\u201cahistorical\u201d, apsychological accounts of\njustification\u2014i.e., accounts which state conditions on a\nbelief\u2019s being justified\n\n\nwithout restriction on why the belief is held, i.e., on what\ncausally initiates the belief or causally sustains\nit. (1979:\n 112)[10]\n\n\nAlso worth noting here are a pair of more strictly\nmeta-epistemological desiderata Goldman announces at the\nstart of the same paper. The first is that an account of justification\nshould be \u201csubstantive\u201d\u2014i.e., that it should specify\nin non-epistemic terms when a belief is justified (p. 105). This\nrecalls, of course, meta-epistemic NE\n (Section 1.2)\u2014i.e.,\n the thought that evaluative epistemic properties are, or must be,\nreducible or otherwise appropriately related to (e.g., supervene on)\n\u201cnatural\u201d properties. And it is sometimes suggested that\nthis\u2014the demand, as Maffie puts it, that\n\u201cepistemic value [be] anchored to descriptive fact, no longer\nentering the world autonomously as brute, fundamental fact\u201d\n(1990a: 284)\u2014is central to the debate over NE (ibid.;\nSteup 1996: 185\u20136). According to Kim, that epistemic properties\ndo plausibly supervene on \u201cnatural facts\u201d is what\nmakes normative epistemology possible, and naturalistically\nrespectable, even if no\n reduction[11]\n is forthcoming:\n\n\n\u2026is there a positive reason for thinking that normative\nepistemology is a viable program?\u2026. The short answer is this:\nwe believe in the supervenience of epistemic properties on\nnaturalistic ones, and more generally, in the supervenience of all\nvaluational and normative properties on naturalistic\nconditions\u2026. That [a given belief] is a justified belief cannot\nbe a brute fundamental fact unrelated to the kind of belief it is.\nThere must be a reason for it, and this reason must be\ngrounded in the factual descriptive properties of that particular\nbelief. Something like this, I think, is what we believe. (Kim 1988:\n399)\n\n\nAs others have observed, however, it is doubtful that the question of\nwhether epistemic properties at least supervene upon natural\nproperties\u2014hence, meta-epistemic NE, as written\u2014sheds much\nlight on the NE-vs-TE controversy (see Foley 1994: 243\u2013244;\nFeldman 2012: Section 4; Maffie 1990a: 289; Kappel 2011: 839). For\nvirtually everyone on both sides of that debate can be seen as\nagreeing that epistemic properties supervene. (The notable exception\nhere is Lehrer 1997.) For example, Chisholm, who is hardly thought to\nbe an advocate of NE, is explicit in holding that epistemic facts\nsupervene on non-epistemic ones (1989: 42\u201343; cf. 1957:\n31\u201339; 1982: 12)\u2014for instance, that being appeared to in\ncertain ways makes it evident to S that he is appeared to by\nan F, or makes S justified in believing that there\nis an F before him. And Feldman (2012) argues that\nevidentialism\u2014which is usually regarded as an instance of TE,\nnot NE\u2014respects supervenience as well. (Evidentialism has it\nthat what determines whether one is justified is a function of the\nevidence possessed, where one\u2019s evidence, on the view Feldman\nhimself favors, is some combination of one\u2019s experiences,\nmemories and other beliefs.)\n\nSo we do not yet have a plausible candidate, in the vicinity of\nmeta-epistemic NE, of something on which proponents of TE and NE might\nclearly divide. Taking Goldman as our representative of NE, we find a\nsuggestion in his second desideratum\u2014namely, that an\naccount of justification be genuinely explanatory, or\n\u201cappropriately deep and revelatory\u201d (1979: 106). He\nwrites:\n\n\nSuppose, for example, that the following sufficient condition of\njustified belief is offered: \u201cIf S senses redly at\nt and S believes at t that he is sensing\nredly, then S\u2019s belief at t that he is sensing\nredly is justified\u201d. This is not the kind of principle I seek;\nfor, even if it is correct, it leaves unexplained why a\nperson who senses redly and believes that he does, believes this\njustifiably. (1979: 106)\n\n\nSo, while the stated Chisholmian principle itself respects\nsupervenience\u2014what\u2019s mentioned in its antecedent is,\nplausibly, wholly psychological\u2014it fails to be genuinely\nilluminating. As Feldman says, Chisholm holds that, underlying\nparticular epistemic facts such as the one Goldman mentions are\n\u201cprinciples of evidence other than the formal principles of\ndeductive logic and inductive logic\u201d (Chisholm 1977: 67) which\nare themselves fundamental. Further, Feldman continues,\nsomething similar is true of traditionalists more generally:\n\n\nIn addition to facts about particular people being justified in\nbelieving particular propositions, [traditionalists] are committed to\nthe existence of epistemic facts about what beliefs are supported by a\nparticular body of evidence. It remains unclear whether these are\nnatural facts. Traditionalists often regard these facts as necessary\ntruths, and it is their necessity that enables evidentialists to\nendorse the supervenience thesis. [On standard definitions of\nsupervenience, necessary truths supervene on any facts\u2014so,\ntrivially, they supervene on natural facts.]\u2026.[But it] is\nlegitimate to ask whether they count as natural facts. (Feldman 2012:\nSection 4)\n\n\nHowever, regardless of the answer to the latter question, construed as\na metaphysical query, it is clear that the relevant\nmeta-epistemological concern of Goldman\u2019s, at least, is\nmethodological: he wants to explain justification,\nand thinks that an appeal to the reliability of the processes which\ngenerate and sustain a belief, for example, does just that, whereas an\nappeal to Chisholmian\u2014or, presumably,\nevidentialist\u2014principles does not. Similar concerns would apply\nto Chisholm\u2019s (1977) taking reasonableness as\n primitive[12]\n and casting other central epistemic notions in terms of it (as Lehrer\nwould later do; see his 1990: 127): while this is compatible with\nthere in fact being some naturalistic basis for\n reasonableness[13]\u2014i.e.,\n with reasonableness being part of the real, natural world\u2014the\nresulting account would not be \u201cappropriately deep and\nrevelatory\u201d.\n\nOf course, opponents of NE may contest this claim and hold that there\njust are brute epistemic principles and sui generis epistemic\nproperties\u2014as Chisholm, Lehrer, and perhaps many other\ntraditionalists believe (Fumerton, e.g., is quite explicit about this;\n1988: 454\u2013455). And, as Feldman (2012: Section 4) notes, the\ndisagreement here appears to be over what is natural, as opposed to\nover whether extra-natural facts exist. Nevertheless, the present\npoint is that the attempt to avoid any such fundamental epistemic\nproperties or principles in one\u2019s theorizing appears to be a\nreal difference between NE and TE, and seems to be of more central\nimportance than a concern for reduction-or-supervenience per\nse. In any case, it should now be clear that current naturalists\nare not directly inspired by the failure of specifically Cartesian\nepistemology. So even if it\u2019s a mistake on Quine\u2019s part to\nrepresent NE as having such a source, that point does not seem\ndirectly relevant here.\n\n(2) Turning now to the circularity objection, Quine\nhimself addresses it when he says:\n\n\nIf the epistemologist\u2019s goal is validation of the grounds of\nempirical science, he defeats his purpose by using psychology or other\nempirical science in the validation. However, such scruples against\ncircularity have little point once we have stopped dreaming of\ndeducing science from observations. (1969b: 75\u201376)\n\n\nMoreover, this rejoinder aside, it may be that \u201cwe should expect\nquestion begging when the issue concerns our most fundamental methods\nof inquiry\u201d (Foley 1994: 256). Further, there is no guarantee\nanyway that a given method will vindicate itself\u2014a method may\ngenerate evidence that undermines its own reliability\n(ibid.). Finally, just when (if ever) circularity is\nepistemically bad, and why, is a matter of some controversy. (For\ngeneral discussion and references, see Lammenranta n.d. in Other\nInternet Resources; see too Kappel 2011: 843.)\n\n(3) Broadly similar remarks have been suggested in reply to the\nobjection that Quine\u2019s response to skepticism is\nunsatisfactory. While that response may involve blatant\ncircularity, for the reasons just given it\u2019s an open question\nwhether that circularity is vicious. Further, Quine claims, in pointing out that\nskeptical doubts are scientific doubts, he did not take himself to be\nrefuting the skeptic or subjecting skepticism to a reductio\n(1975: 68). More generally, questions might be raised about the\nunderlying assumption that responding to the skeptic in such a way as\nto not beg any questions is an achievable end to begin with, and so\nwhether it is something that deserves as much attention as it has traditionally been\nafforded. Here, proponents of NE diverge somewhat. Kornblith states\nthat the project of responding to the skeptic is \u201ca dead\nend\u201d (1999: 166). In a similar vein, Kitcher says that\n\u201c[s]keptics who insist that we begin from no\nassumptions are inviting us to play a mug\u2019s game\u201d (1993:\n35). Dretske (1970, 1981) is more conciliatory, offering an\nexplanation that grants certain skeptical claims their power, even\ncorrectness, while defending our knowledge nonetheless. And both\nGoldman (1986: 39\u201341, 55\u201357; 1976: 101) and Pollock (1986:\n1\u20137) take it to be a task of epistemology to address\nskepticism\u2014even if our goal therein is to understand and learn\nfrom skepticism rather than to refute it, and even if the topic deserves less\nattention than it has historically received.\n\n(4) Kornblith sums up the normativity objection as\nfollows: \u201cEpistemology without normativity\u2026is just\nHamlet without the prince of Denmark\u201d (1995: 250). As\nwe saw above, it looks as though handing epistemology off to\npsychology (replacement NE) makes epistemology a purely descriptive\nenterprise (hence, yields eliminative NE). Certainly, Quine\nis hardly friendly to epistemology as standardly practiced.\nFor example, he thinks that, as it\u2019s usually understood, the\nnotion of knowledge is so beset by imprecision that, for theoretical\npurposes, we should \u201cgive [it] up\u2026 as a bad job\u201d\n(1989: 109; see too Johnsen 2005: 92\u201393). And no doubt\n\u201cEpistemology Naturalized\u201d encourages the standard\ninterpretation of Quine as jettisoning a concern for normative\nepistemic matters. Nonetheless, as recent commentators have pointed\nout (see, e.g., Foley 1994 and Johnsen 2005; both cite numerous\nexamples of the standard interpretation), in his later work, Quine\ninsists that \u201c[t]he normative is naturalized, not dropped\u201d\n(1990: 229). He writes:\n\n\nNaturalization of epistemology does not jettison the normative and\nsettle for the indiscriminate description of ongoing procedures. For\nme normative epistemology is a branch of engineering. It is the\ntechnology of truth-seeking, or, in a more cautiously epistemological\nterm, prediction. Like any technology, it makes free use of whatever\nscientific findings may suit its purpose. It draws upon mathematics in\ncomputing standard deviation and probable error and in scouting the\ngambler\u2019s fallacy. It draws upon experimental psychology in\nexposing perceptual illusions, and upon cognitive psychology in\nscouting wishful thinking. It draws upon neurology and physics, in a\ngeneral way, in discounting testimony from occult or parapsychological\nsources. There is no question here of ultimate value, as in morals; it\nis a matter of efficacy for an ulterior end, truth or prediction. The\nnormative here, as elsewhere in engineering, becomes descriptive when\nthe terminal parameter is expressed. (Quine 1986: 664\u2013665)\n\n\nFor Quine, then, epistemic normativity is simply a matter of\ninstrumental efficacy towards the relevant end\u2014viz., truth or\nprediction. Thus, normative epistemology \u201cgets naturalized into\na chapter of engineering: the technology of anticipating sensory\nstimulation\u201d (1992: 19). He continues:\n\n\nThe most notable norm of naturalized epistemology actually coincides\nwith that of traditional epistemology. It is simply the watchword of\nempiricism: nihil in mente quod non prius in sensu. This is a\nprime specimen of naturalized epistemology, for it is a finding of\nnatural science itself, however fallible, that our information about\nthe world comes only through the impact of our sensory receptors. And\nstill the point is normative, warning us against telepaths and\nsoothsayers. (Quine 1992: 19)\n\n\n(5) So Quine does have an account of epistemic normativity after all,\nand thus a response to the normativity objection to (his version of)\nNE. And yet, one might see that response as inviting once again the\ncharge of self-defeat. For example, one might wonder\nwhy it is truth, or prediction\u2014rather than\npleasure, say, or monetary gain\u2014that is the epistemic end. Is\nthat a result of science, discovered a posteriori\n(compare Foley 1994: 249)? A friend of TE is likely to see it, rather,\nas a conceptual truth that is knowable, intuitively, a priori. Similarly, one can wonder whether natural science per\nse really does underwrite the putative empiricist\n\u201cwatchword\u201d. Much recent developmental psychology, for\ninstance, seems to suggest that at least some empirical\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (or empirical \u201ctheories\u201d or\n\u201cassumptions\u201d) is native, rather than sensorily acquired\n(see Samet and Zaitchik 2014 for an overview).\u2014Not that such a\ncontrary finding, or theoretical disagreement on the matter within the\nrelevant sciences, would itself pose a problem for Quine\u2019s\ngeneral approach to NE. The relevant point, rather, is that the matter\nand disagreement in question are theoretical, and that it is\nnot immediately clear whether it is something that can be settled\nwithout the help of \u201cold-fashioned\u201d methods such as\narmchair reflection, some of it perhaps a priori, on the\nrelevant data and issues. (The present worry could be developed along\nother lines\u2014e.g., that natural science presupposes that\ntruth or prediction is the end, that the senses are what give us\ninformation about the world, etc. This would take us back to worries\nabout circularity. As we\u2019ve already seen, there is inter-play\nbetween the concerns to which NE gives rise.)\n\nNonetheless, while he is best-known for taking psychology\u2014and,\nwhat\u2019s more, behavioristic psychology (\u201cneural receptors\nand their stimulation rather than sense of\n sensibilia\u201d[14]\n (Quine 1992: 19))\u2014to be the successor to TE, Quine has a\nvery broad conception of science. Science for Quine includes\nhumble, everyday common sense thinking, after all. Further, while he\nsometimes speaks of one discipline replacing another, Quine also\nexpresses his idea in terms of the \u201crubbing out\u201d (1969b:\n90) or \u201cblurring\u201d (1995: 257) of disciplinary boundaries\nsuch as that between epistemology and science. Finally, given his\nrejection of analyticity, his consequent rejection of the a\n priori,[15]\n and his holism about both meaning and confirmation, it is quite\nunclear how Quine could maintain any hard and fast\ndistinction between philosophy and science (Gregory 2006: 660). For\nthese reasons, it is unclear whether the entirety of traditional\nphilosophical methods per se would\u2014or could\u2014be\nexcluded from a respectable Quinean\n epistemology.[16]\n Unfortunately, Quine himself does not provide a clear and direct\naccount of what, notwithstanding the rejection of the a\npriori, might indeed remain of TE and its method within\n\u201cepistemology naturalized\u201d.\n\nWhere we are left, then, is needing a way of understanding how, within\nthe constraints of NE, truth (or prediction) comes to be fixed as the\nepistemic end, such that the normativity objection can be fully met.\nMore generally, we need some respectable naturalistic version of traditional\nphilosophical methods (reflecting on cases, consulting our intuitions,\nand so on), or of alternative methods closely approximating them. For\nit seems that it is only if we have something playing those\nmethods\u2019 usual role\u2014constructing and arbitrating between\ntheories, directing our more obviously empirical inquiries, and so\non\u2014that the charge of self-defeat can be avoided.\n\nBoth of these matters\u2014the ability of NE to account for epistemic\nnormativity, and to accommodate or find a suitable replacement for the\ntraditional philosophical methodology that some see as indispensable\nto epistemological theorizing\u2014are at the center of current\ndebate both about, and within, NE. Over the next two sections we\nconsider two prominent means of addressing these matters\u2014those\noffered by Hilary Kornblith and by Alvin Goldman\u2014and the\nchallenges that each faces.\n",
