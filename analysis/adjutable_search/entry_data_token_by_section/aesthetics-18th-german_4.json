    "main_text": "Gottsched and His Critics: Truth and Imagination || Gottsched\n2.1 Gottsched\n\nJohann Christoph Gottsched (1700\u201366) was born in K\u00f6nigsberg\nand studied philosophy there.  He began teaching philosophy there in\n1723, but fled the Prussian draft the next year and settled in the\nSaxon city of Leipzig, where Leibniz had earlier studied. Leipzig is\nonly thirty kilometers away from Halle, the Prussian city where Wolff\nhad been teaching for two decades; but Wolff had been driven from\nHalle in 1722 by the reaction to his argument that the\n\u201catheistic\u201d Chinese could arrive at the same moral truths\nas Christian Europeans by the use of human reason alone. So Gottsched\nmay never have met Wolff. Nevertheless, he had already been exposed to\nWolffian philosophy in K\u00f6nigsberg, and his two-volume Erste\nGr\u00fcnde der gesamten Weltweisheit (\u201cFirst Principles of\nall Philosophy,\u201d 1733\u201334), which includes an extensive\nreview of natural science as well as logic, metaphysics, and ethics,\nbecame the most widely adopted textbook of Wolffian\nphilosophy. However, although he eventually held the professorship in\nlogic and metaphysics in Leipzig, Gottsched was also the professor of\npoetry, and by far the greatest part of his boundless energy was\ndevoted to literature and philology. In the history of aesthetics, his\nreputation rests on his Versuch einer critischen Dichtkunst vor\ndie Deutschen (\u201cEssay toward a Critical Poetics for the\nGermans,\u201d 1730, with further editions in 1737, 1742, and\n1751).\n\n\nThe practical aim of the Critical Poetics was to elevate the\ntone of German popular theater and moderate the Baroque excesses of\nthe upper-class theater by recommending the model of the classical\nFrench theater of Racine and Corneille. The theoretical basis of the\nwork was the Wolffian principle that the theater and other forms of\npoetry (Gottsched had little to say about the emerging medium of the\nnovel) should be used to convey important moral truths through images\nthat would make them accessible and engaging for a wide audience.\nGottsched stated his position a year before the Critical\nPoetics in a speech with the anti-Platonic title \u201cPlays and\nespecially tragedies are not to be banished from a well-ordered\nrepublic\u201d where he defined a tragedy as\nan instructive moral poem, in which an important\naction of preeminent persons is imitated and presented on the\nstage. (Gottsched, Schriften, p. 5)\n\n\nHe revealed the underlying premise of his\nargument when he observed that\nThe improvement of the human heart is not a work\nwhich can happen in an hour. It requires a thousand preparations, a\nthousand circumstances, much knowledge, conviction, experiences,\nexamples and encouragement\u2026. (Schriften, p. 9)\n\n\nIt would become a central theme of German\nEnlightenment aesthetics that even if people know the general truths\nof morality in some abstract way, the arts can make those truths\nconcrete, alive, and effective for them in a way that nothing else\ncan. The Critical Poetics opens with a brief history of\npoetry rather than with a statement of theoretical principles, but its\nfirst chapter concludes with a similar suggestion that the point of\npoetry is to make moral truths alive through their presentation in a\nform accessible to our senses: \u201cThe arousal of affects\nis\u2026much livelier\u201d in tragedy and comedy than anywhere\nelse,\nbecause the visible representation of persons is\nfar more sensibly touching than the best description. The manner of\nwriting is, especially in tragedy, noble and sublime, and it has\nrather a superfluity than a lack of instructive sayings. Even comedy\nteaches and instructs the observer, although it arouses\nlaughter. (Schriften, p. 33)\n\n\nThe details of Gottsched\u2019s view emerge in the\nsucceeding chapters on \u201cThe character of a poet\u201d and\n\u201cOn the good taste of a poet.\u201d\n\n\nIn the first of these chapters, Gottsched defines a poet as one who\nproduces imitations of nature:\n\n\nA poet is a skilled imitator of all natural things; and this he has in\ncommon with painters, connoisseurs of music, etc. He is however\ndistinguished from these by the manner of his imitation and the means\nthrough which he achieves it. The painter imitates nature with brush\nand colors; the musician through beat and harmony; the poet, however,\nthrough a discourse that is rhythmic or otherwise well arranged; or,\nwhich is much the same, through a harmonious and good-sounding text,\nwhich we call a poem. (Schriften, p.  39)\n\n\n\nGottsched goes on to argue that a poet must have a sharp wit or\nacumen, a \u201cpower of mind which readily perceives the similarity\nof things and thus can make a comparison among them,\u201d but also\nthat such a \u201cnatural gift\u201d is \u201cin itself still raw\nand imperfect if it is not awaked and cleansed of the incorrectness\nthat clings to it\u201d (Schriften, p. 44).\n\n\nFor the wit of a poet to lead to good results, it must therefore be\naccompanied with \u201cart and learning,\u201d \u201cextensive\nscholarship,\u201d and a strong \u201cpower of judgment,\u201d\nincluding sound moral judgment, because his task is to make moral\ntruths accessible to his audience through his imitations.  All of\nthese capacities require cultivation; once they have been cultivated,\nthe artist can better fulfill his double task of imitation: through\nthe imitation of worthy deeds in the medium of his art, he is to\nencourage his audience to the performance of similarly worthy deeds\nthemselves.\n\n\nThus far, Gottsched has not made special use of Wolffian terms. His\nensuing discussion of the \u201cgood taste of a poet\u201d is more\nexplicitly Wolffian. Gottsched begins by characterizing taste in its\nliteral sense\u2014the taste of food or drink\u2014as a form of\nrepresentation \u201cthat for all of its clarity has nothing distinct\nin it.\u201d He then states that in its \u201cmetaphorical\u201d\nsense taste is always associated with the \u201cliberal arts and\nother sensible things,\u201d such as \u201cpoetry, oratory, music,\npainting, and architecture, likewise in dress, gardens, household\nfurnishings, etc.,\u201d not with subjects \u201cwhere it is a\nmatter of reason alone\u201d and \u201cwhere it is possible to make\nthe strictest demonstrations from distinctly cognized fundamental\ntruths,\u201d such as \u201carithmetic and geometry or other\nsciences\u201d (Schriften, pp. 60\u20131).  Thus\n\u201cmetaphorical as well as ordinary taste has to do only with\nclear but not entirely distinct concepts of things, and distinguishes\nfrom one another the sort of things that one judges in accordance with\nmere sensation.\u201d However, although it follows from the fact that\njudgments of taste are made on the basis of \u201cclear but not\nentirely distinct concepts\u201d that \u201cpeople who judge merely\non the basis of taste\u201d can arrive at opposite conclusions,\nGottsched holds that such opposed judgments cannot both be true, and\nthat there must be a true fact of the matter to which one but not the\nother of them corresponds. In other words, although judgments of taste\nare made on the basis of clear but indistinct concepts, which is to\nsay sensory perceptions and feelings rather than clear and distinct\nconcepts, they nevertheless\nhave their ground in the unalterable nature of\nthings themselves; in the concordance of the manifold; in order and\nharmony. These laws, which are investigated, discovered, and confirmed\nthrough lengthy experience and much reflection, are unbreakable and\nfirm, even if someone who judges in accordance with his taste\nsometimes gives preference to those works which more or less violate\nthem. (Schriften, pp.  62\u20133)\n\n\nIn Gottsched\u2019s view, judgments of taste, even if\n they are not made on the basis of explicit knowledge of objective\n rules about the perfection of things, track those objective rules\n when they are in fact correct. Experts in the relevant art can make\n those rules explicit. The \u201ctouchstone\u201d for judgments of\n taste\nis thus found in the rules for perfection that are\nsuitable for every particular kind of beautiful things, whether\nbuildings, paintings, music, etc., and which can be distinctly\nconceived and demonstrated by genuine masters\nthereof. (Schriften, pp. 64\u20135)\n\n\nThus judgments of taste are not to be attributed\nto \u201cwit, nor to imagination, nor to memory,\u201d nor to any\n\u201csixth sense,\u201d but to \u201cunderstanding,\u201d\nalthough not to \u201creason\u201d (Schriften,\npp. 63\u20134)), since these judgments track the rules that the\nexperts know but are not explicitly derived from those rules.\n\n\nAnd what are the rules in accordance with which judgments of taste are\ntacitly made? The most general rule is simply that art should imitate\nnature, so that in order to be beautiful art must imitate what is\nbeautiful in nature. Poets in particular must give truthful but lively\ndescriptions of \u201cnatural things,\u201d and in the case of\npoetry destined for the theater they must give their characters\n\u201csuch words, gestures, and actions\u201d as are\n\u201cappropriate to their circumstances\u201d (Schriften,\np. 81). Gottsched does not interpret this rule to mean that poets can\ndescribe only the actual actions and feelings of actual people; of\ncourse poetry can present fables as well as history. But for Gottsched\na fable is\nan occurrence that is possible in certain\ncircumstances although it has not actually taken place, in which a\nuseful moral truth lies hidden. Philosophically one could say that it\nis a piece of another possible world (Schriften, p. 86)\n\n\nInsofar as it does not recount an actual event a\n fable is \u201cprobable\u201d rather than \u201ctrue.\u201d But\n for Gottsched probability depends upon the consistency of the\n fictional event with the actual laws of nature, in particular the\n laws of human nature, even though the circumstances of the fictional\n world differ in some regard from those of the actual world. In this\n regard even the fable must still be an imitation of nature with all\n its perfections. Of course Gottsched\u2019s rider that the fable must\n contain a hidden moral truth means that it must also be consistent\n with the real rules of moral perfection, and indeed that the point of\n poetic indulgence in fable or fiction is precisely to make a moral\n truth alive and forceful to us by showing that it holds even in a\n possible world that differs from the actual world in certain of its\n facts but not in its principles.\n",
