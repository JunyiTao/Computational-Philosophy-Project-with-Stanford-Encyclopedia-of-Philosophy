    "main_text": "Empiricism and nativism about concepts || Empiricism about concepts\n3.2 Empiricism about concepts\n\nTraditionally, empiricists have argued that all concepts derive from\nsensations. Concepts were understood to be formed from copies of\nsensory representations and assembled in accordance with a set of\ngeneral-purpose learning rules, e.g., Hume\u2019s principles of\nassociation (Hume 1739/1978). On this view, the content of any concept\nmust be analyzable in terms of its perceptual basis. Any purported\nconcept that fails this test embodies a confusion. Thus David Hume\nends his Enquiry with the famous remark:\n\nWhen we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc\nmust we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school\nmetaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any\nabstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it\ncontain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and\nexistence? No. Commit it then to the flames: For it can contain\nnothing but sophistry and illusion. (1748/1975, p. 165)\n\n\nA similar doctrine was maintained by the logical positivists in the\nearly Twentieth Century, though the positivists couched the view in\nlinguistic terms (Ayer 1959). Their principle of verification required\nfor a sentence or statement to be meaningful that it have empirical\nconsequences, and, on some formulations of the principle, that the\nmeaning of a sentence is the empirical procedure for confirming it\n(see the entry\n Vienna Circle).\n Sentences that have no empirical consequences were deemed to be\nmeaningless. Since a good deal of philosophy purports to express\npropositions that transcend all possible experience, the positivists\nwere happy to say that these philosophical doctrines are entirely\ndevoid of content and are composed of sentences that aren\u2019t\nmerely false but are literally gibberish.\n\nDespite the unpopularity of verificationism (though see Dummett 1993,\nWright 1989, and Dennett 1991), a growing number of philosophers are\nattracted to modified forms of empiricism, forms that primarily\nemphasize psychological relations between the conceptual system and\nperceptual and motor states, not semantic relations. An example is\nLawrence Shapiro\u2019s defense of the claim that the type of body\nthat an organism has profoundly affects its cognitive operations as\nwell as the way that the organism is likely to conceptualize the world\n(Shapiro 2004). Shapiro\u2019s claim is directed against\nphilosophical theories that willfully ignore contingent facts about\nhuman bodies as if a human mind could inhere in wildly different body\ntypes. Drawing on a number of empirical research programs, Shapiro\ncites examples that appear to support what he calls the embodied\nmind thesis, viz., that \u201cminds profoundly reflect the\nbodies in which they are contained\u201d (Shapiro 2004, p. 167).\n\nJesse Prinz (2002) also defends a modified form of empiricism. Prinz\nclaims that \u201call (human) concepts are copies or combinations of\ncopies of perceptual representations\u201d (Prinz 2002, p. 108).\nThough the reference to copies is a nod to Hume, Prinz certainly\ndoesn\u2019t buy into Hume\u2019s verificationism. In fact, Prinz\nadopts a causal theory of content of the kind that is usually\nassociated with atomistic theories of concepts (e.g., Fodor 1998);\nthus Prinz\u2019s theory of intentional content doesn\u2019t require\na concept to inherit the specifically perceptual content of its\nconstituents. Nonetheless, Prinz thinks that every concept derives\nfrom perceptual representations. Perhaps the best way to understand\nthe claim is that the mental representations that are activated when\nsomeone thinks about something\u2014no matter what the\nthought\u2014are representations that originate in neural circuits\nwith perceptual or motor functions and that the mental process is\naffected by that origin. Suppose, for example, that one is thinking\nabout a hammer. Then she is either activating representations that\ninhere in visual circuits, or representations involved in circuits\nthat control hand shape, etc., and her thought is affected in some way\nby the primary function of these circuits. Following Lawrence Barsalou\n(1999; see also Barsalou et al. 2003), Prinz characterizes concept\npossession as a kind of simulation \u201ctantamount to entering a\nperceptual state of the kind one would be in if one were to experience\nthe thing it represents\u201d (Prinz 2002, p. 150).\n\nOne challenge to this view of cognition is its implication for\nabstract concepts. It\u2019s one thing to say that the concept HAMMER\ninvolves the activation of circuits related to hand shape; it\u2019s\nquite another to identify representations tied to a particular sensory\nmodality underlying such concepts as TRUTH, DEMOCRACY, ENTROPY, and\nNINETEEN (Adams & Campbell 1999, Brewer 1999). Logical concepts\nare also a challenge. Prinz suggests as a perceptual basis for the\nconcept of disjunction that it is based on feelings of hesitation.\nHowever, his more considered view seems to be that logical concepts\nare best understood as operations, not representations. The resulting\ntheory is one in which thoughts lack logical form. The trouble is that\nthis makes it difficult to see how to distinguish logically equivalent\nthoughts. A related problem is that, since composition for Prinz does\nnot yield structurally complex representations, there seems to be\nnothing to distinguish the type of contents associated with judgements\n(propositional contents) from those associated lists or even single\nconcepts (for related discussion Fodor 2003). Finally, there are\ndifficulties regarding how to interpret behavioral and neurological\nevidence that is supposed to support Prinz and Barsalou\u2019s case\nagainst amodal representations. For example, Machery (2007) points out\nthat proponents of amodal representations typically suppose that\nimagery is useful in solving certain types of problems. So to argue\nagainst amodal representations, it is not enough to show that sensory\nrepresentations show up in a task in which experimental subjects are\nnot explicitly told to visualize a solution, since the use of\nsensory-based imagery in a task is perfectly compatible with there\nalso being amodal representations in play. (For further critical\ndiscussion of the form of empiricism that is opposed to amodal\nrepresentations, see Weiskopf 2007, Dove 2009, and Mahon 2015).\n",
