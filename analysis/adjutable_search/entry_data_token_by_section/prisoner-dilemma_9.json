    "main_text": "Transparency\n10. Transparency\n\nAnother way that conditional moves can be introduced into the PD is by\nassuming that players have the property that David Gauthier has\nlabeled transparency. A fully transparent player is one whose\nintentions are completely visible to others. Nobody holds that we\nhumans are fully transparent, but the observation that we can often\nsuccessfully predict what others will do suggests that we are at least\n\u201ctranslucent.\u201d Furthermore agents of larger scale, like\nfirms or countries, which may have to publicly deliberate before\nacting, may be more transparent than we are. Thus there may be some\ntheoretical interest in investigations of PDs with transparent\nplayers. Such players could presumably execute conditional strategies\nmore sophisticated than those of the (non-transparent) extended game\nplayers, strategies, for example that are conditional on the\nconditional strategies employed by others. There is some difficulty,\nhowever, in determining exactly what strategies are feasible for such\nplayers. Suppose Row adopted the strategy \u201cdo the same as\nColumn\u201d and Column adopted the strategy \u201cdo the opposite\nof Row\u201d. There is no way that both these strategies could be\nsatisfied. On the other hand, if each adopted the strategy\n\u201cimitate the other player\u201d, there are two ways the\nstrategies could be satisfied, and there is no way to determine which\nof the two they would adopt. Nigel Howard, who was probably the first\nto study such conditional strategies systematically, avoided this\ndifficulty by insisting on a rigidly typed hierarchy of games. At the\nbase level we have the ordinary PD game, where each player chooses\nbetween \\(\\bC\\) and \\(\\bD\\). For any game \\(G\\) in the hierarchy we\ncan generate two new games \\(RG\\) and \\(CG\\). In \\(RG\\), Column has\nthe same moves as in game \\(G\\) and Row can choose any function that\nassigns \\(\\bC\\) or \\(\\bD\\) to each of Column's possible moves.\nSimilarly in \\(CG\\), Row has the same moves as in \\(G\\) and Column has\na new set of conditional moves. For example, if [PD] is the base level\ngame, then \\(C\\)[PD] is the game in which Column can choose from among\nthe strategies \\(\\bCu\\), \\(\\bDu\\), \\(\\bI\\) and \\(\\bO\\) mentioned\nabove. Howard observed that in the two third level games \\(RC\\)[PD]\nand \\(CR\\)[PD] (and in every higher level game) there is an\nequilibrium outcome giving each player \\(R\\). In particular, such an\nequilibrium is reached when one player plays \\(\\bI\\) and the other\ncooperates when his opponent plays \\(\\bI\\) and defects when his\nopponent plays \\(\\bCu\\), \\(\\bDu\\) or \\(\\bO\\). Notice that this last\nstrategy is tantamount to Danielson's reciprocal cooperation\ndescribed in the last section.\n\nThe lesson of all this for rational action is not clear. Suppose two\nplayers in a PD were sufficiently transparent to employ the\nconditional strategies of higher level games. How do they decide what\nlevel game to play? Who chooses the imitation move and who chooses\nreciprocal cooperation? To make a move in a higher level game is\npresumably to form an intention observable by the other player. But\nwhy should either player expect the intention to be carried out if\nthere is benefit in ignoring it?\n\nConditional strategies have a more convincing application when we take\nour inquiry as directed, not towards playing the PD, but as designing\nagents who would play it well with a variety of likely opponents. This\nis the viewpoint of Danielson. (See also J.V. Howard for an earlier\nenlightening discussion of this viewpoint.) A conditional strategy is\nnot an intention that a player forms as a move in a game, but a\ndeterministic algorithm defining a kind of player. Indeed, one of the\nlessons of the PD may be that transparent agents are better off if\nthey can form irrevocable \u201caction protocols\u201d rather than\nalways following the intentions they may form at the time of action.\nDanielson does not limit himself a priori to strategies\nwithin Howard's hierarchy. An agent is simply a computer program,\nwhich can contain lines permitting other programs to read and execute\nit. We could easily write two such programs, each designed to\ndetermine whether its opponent plays \\(\\bC\\) or \\(\\bD\\) and to do the\nopposite. What happens when these two play a PD depends on the details\nof implementation, but it is likely that they will be\n\u201cincoherent,\u201d i.e., they will enter endless loops and be\nunable to make any move at all. To be successful a program\nshould be able to move when paired with a variety of other\nprograms, including copies of itself, and it should be able to get\nvaluable outcomes. Programs implementing \\(\\bI\\) and \\(\\bO\\) in a\nstraightforward way are not likely to succeed because when paired with\neach other they will be incoherent. Programs implementing \\(\\bDu\\) are\nnot likely to succeed because they get only \\(P\\) when paired with\ntheir clones. Those implementing \\(\\bCu\\) are not likely to succeed\nbecause they get only \\(S\\) when paired with programs that recognize\nand exploit their unconditionally cooperative nature. There is some\nvagueness in the criteria of success. In Howard's scheme we could\ncompare a conditional strategy with all the possible alternatives of\nthat level. Here, where any two programs can be paired, that approach\nis senseless. Nevertheless, certain programs seem to do well when\npaired with a wide variety of players. One is a version of the\nstrategy that Gauthier has advocated as constrained\nmaximization. The idea is that a player \\(j\\) should cooperate if\nthe other would cooperate if \\(j\\) did, and defect otherwise. As\nstated, this appears to be a strategy for the \\(RC\\)[PD] or \\(CR\\)[PD]\ngames. It is not clear how a program implementing it would move (if\nindeed it does move) when paired with itself. Danielson is able to\nconstruct an approximation to constrained maximization,\nhowever, that does cooperate with itself. Danielson's program (and\nother implementations of constrained maximization) cannot be\ncoherently paired with everything. Nevertheless it does move and score\nwell against familiar strategies. It cooperates with \\(\\bCu\\) and\nitself and it defects against \\(\\bDu\\). If it is coherently paired it\nseems guaranteed a payoff no worse than \\(P\\).\n\nA second successful program models Danielson's reciprocal\ncooperation. Again, it is not clear that the strategy (as\nformulated above) allows it to cooperate (or make any move) with\nitself, but Danielson is able to construct an approximation that does.\nThe (approximate) reciprocal cooperation does as well as\n(approximate) constrained maximization against itself,\n\\(\\bDu\\) and constrained maximization. Against \\(\\bCu\\) it\ndoes even better, getting \\(T\\) where constrained\nmaximization got only \\(R\\).\n",
