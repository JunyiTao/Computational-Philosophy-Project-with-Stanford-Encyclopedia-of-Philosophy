However, there are also other\naccounts in the psychology literature. Robert Goldstone\u2019s\naccount of perceptual learning, for instance, agrees with\nGibson\u2019s account in many respects, but it additionally offers a\nstory of why perceptual changes occur. On his account, \n\n\nPerceptual learning involves relatively long-lasting changes to an\norganism\u2019s perceptual system that improve its ability to respond\nto its environment and are caused by this environment. (1998:\n587, italics added for emphasis) \n\n\nThis definition offers an answer to the question as to why perceptual\nlearning occurs at all. On Goldstone\u2019s account, perceptual\nlearning occurs to improve an organism\u2019s ability to respond to\nthe environment.\n\nGoldstone\u2019s account admits of two different interpretations. On\none interpretation, the account places a condition on perceptual\nlearning: that to count as an instance of perceptual learning, a\nlong-term perceptual change has to improve an organism\u2019s ability\nto respond to the environment. Such an account gains plausibility if\none thinks of \u201clearning\u201d as a success-term. The idea then\nis that each genuine instance of perceptual learning leads to success\nfor the organism, namely, it improves the organism\u2019s ability to\nrespond to the environment. On a second interpretation of\nGoldstone\u2019s account, however, it is not that each instance of\nperceptual learning has to improve an organism\u2019s ability to\nrespond to the environment. Rather, it is that perceptual learning is\na general capacity for improving an organism\u2019s ability to\nrespond to the environment, even if perceptual learning fails to do so\nin some instances. Why might organisms have such a capacity? One\npossibility is that the capacity is a trait that improves fitness and\nis the product of natural selection. However, the biological origin of\nperceptual learning is an area of research that still needs to be\ncarefully explored. \n",
