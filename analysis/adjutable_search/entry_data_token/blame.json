A paradigm case, perhaps, would be\nwhen one person wrongs another, and the latter responds with\nresentment and a verbal rebuke, but of course we also blame others for\ntheir attitudes and characters (see, e.g., Smith 2005). Thus blaming\nscenarios typically involve a wide range of inward and outward\nresponses to a wrongful or bad action, attitude, or character (such\nresponses include: beliefs, desires, expectations, emotions,\nsanctions, and so on). In theorizing about blame, then, philosophers\nhave typically asked two questions:\n\n Which precise reactions and interactions constitute blame?\n Under what conditions is it appropriate to respond in these\nways?\n\n\nMany theorists approach these questions with a larger theoretical\nagenda in mind: for example, in an effort to understand the conditions\nof moral responsibility more generally and the nature of freedom\n(e.g., Wallace 1994), or in an effort to articulate the content of\nmoral properties (e.g., Gibbard 1990). But the questions are\ninteresting in their own right, especially since blame is such a\ncommon feature of moral experience. This entry will critically discuss\nthe answers that have been offered in response to the above questions\nconcerning blame, with the aim of shedding some light on blame\u2019s\nnature, ethics, and significance. (A common but by no means universal\nassumption is that praise is the counterpart of blame; still, it is\nblame that is often taken to be the more significant phenomenon for\nmoral philosophy.)\n", "toc": [{"#WhaBla": "1.

What is Blame?\n\nTo begin, note that almost all philosophical discussions of blame\nignore (or mention only to set aside) the form of blame sometimes\ncharacterized as causal or explanatory responsibility (Kenner 1967;\nHart 1968; Beardsley 1969). It is this notion of blame that is at\nstake when we say that Hurricane Hugo is to blame for the destruction\nof Charleston\u2019s harbor, or that the cat is to blame for knocking over\nthe vase. Theorists contrast this sense of \u201cblame\u201d with\nthe sort of interpersonal blame that, for example, one gives\nup when one forgives. (As Pamela Hieronymi (2001) has pointed out,\nforgiveness in fact requires not giving up one\u2019s judgment\nthat the other person is explanatorily to blame.) But just\nwhat the relation is between causal blame and interpersonal blame is\nan important question that has not been well-explored. Nevertheless,\nin this entry the focus will be on the latter form of blame, which is\na response to moral agents on the basis of their wrong, bad, or\notherwise objectionable actions, attitudes, or characters.\n\nTheories of blame could be organized in a number of different ways,\ndepending on one\u2019s purposes. Consider three of these possible ways.\nFirst, we could categorize theories of blame according to the\ncontent of blaming attitudes. On this way of dividing up\nthings, the view put forth by Pamela Hieronymi (2004)\u2014which\nholds that the force of blame is located in judgments of ill\nwill\u2014would be categorized with that of R. Jay Wallace (1994,\n2011)\u2014which holds that blame is an emotional response to ill\nwill displayed in others\u2019 actions. Alternatively, we could categorize\ntheories of blame according to those psychological states or\ndispositions that are thought to constitute blame. This\nsecond way of dividing things up emphasizes an important difference\nbetween Hieronymi\u2019s and Wallace\u2019s theories: for Hieronymi, blame can\nbe identified primarily with a judgment, but for Wallace, blame is\nprimarily an emotion. A third way might instead focus on\nobjects of blaming attitudes and behaviors. Is blame directed\nexclusively at actions? Or can it instead be directed at attitudes,\nincluding beliefs, as in the case of epistemic blame (see, e.g.,\nRettler 2018)? Here a theory that emphasizes the significance of\nemotions might opt for a more circumscribed account, since it\u2019s not\nclear that indignation or other forms of blaming anger are really apt\nresponses to, say, culpable epistemic failures. By contrast, a theory\n(like Hieronymi\u2019s or Angela Smith\u2019s (2005)) that has a more\nminimal conception of blame can more easily account for blame for\nattitudes. \n\nOf course, any scheme for categorizing theories has its advantages and\ndisadvantages, and by selecting one scheme over the other, one\nnecessarily emphasizes certain aspects of blame while ignoring other\naspects of blame that might be equally important. Nevertheless, the taxonomy to follow is consonant with much of the literature in classifying theories according to the\nactivity or mental state that is thought to constitute blame. According to this way of\ncarving things up, we get four categories: cognitive, emotional,\nconative, and functional accounts of blame.\n1.1 Cognitive Theories of Blame\n\nCognitive theories of blame hold that blame is fundamentally a\njudgment or evaluation that we make about an agent in light of their\nactions, attitudes, or character. One of the earliest cognitive theories of blame\nis due to J. J. C. Smart (1961), who develops his analysis of blame\nindirectly, since he begins by distinguishing between praise and\ndispraise (rather than with the more natural distinction\nbetween praise and blame). According to Smart, to praise or dispraise\nan individual is simply to grade them as a member of a\nparticular kind. And as Smart says, this sort of grading is no\ndifferent than the sort of grading involved in judging one apple to be\nbetter than the others at the supermarket. Crucially, Smart notes\nthat though you might dispraise a young philosopher for their poor\nwriting in a letter of recommendation, you are not thereby blaming\nthem for it. Thus for Smart, blame is distinct from dispraise. Unlike\ndispraise, blame involves more than merely grading someone\u2019s actions\nor character (morally), since blame carries with it the implication\nthat the person is responsible for their action or character. Blame,\nthen, is a negative evaluative judgment that implies\nresponsibility.\n\nIn a similar vein, Gary Watson (1996) has suggested that there is an\nevaluative form of blame connected with what he calls the\n\u201caretaic perspective\u201d. To blame someone in this way is to\njudge that they have failed with respect to some standard of\nexcellence (aret\u00e9). It is also to insist that the agent is\nresponsible for their action in the sense that the action is\nattributable to the agent\u2014it represents their\nevaluative standpoint, their practical identity, what they\n\u201cstand for\u201d (Watson 1996). Like Smart, Watson recognizes\nthat it is possible to make such a judgment dispassionately. Thus, on\nthe grading and evaluative theories of blame developed by Smart and\nWatson, there is nothing about blame that requires a blamer to be\nemotionally exercised in any way. However, unlike Smart\u2014who\nidentifies blame with a form of grading that implies moral\nresponsibility\u2014Watson does not take aretaic blame to be a\ngeneral analysis of blame. Rather, for Watson, aretaic blame\nis just one way among many that we blame others for their actions.\n\n\nEven though many have resisted thinking of blame as a form of grading,\na number of contemporary accounts of blame retain the core idea in\nSmart\u2019s (and Watson\u2019s) account that blame is a kind of evaluative\njudgment. But what sort of evaluative judgment will do? Many theorists\nhave identified blame with judgments that essentially implicate how\nthe blamed agent\u2019s moral or practical self was involved in the\nproduction of action. This allows cognitive theories to explain the\nspecial force of blame. After all, as T.M. Scanlon puts it,\n\u201cgiven that most people care about\u201d their moral selves\n(and others\u2019 opinions about their moral selves), judgments that\nimplicate these aspects of a person are not \u201cmere\ndescriptions\u201d (Scanlon 1986: 170). Michael Zimmerman (1988) and\nIshtiyaque Haji (1998) make this point more vividly when they argue\nthat to blame someone is to judge that in virtue of their attitudes,\nactions, or character, they have a stain on their moral self\nor a mark against their moral ledger. As Zimmerman puts it, when we\nblame someone, we judge\n\n\nthat there is a \u201cdiscredit\u201d or \u201cdebit\u201d in his\nledger \u2026 that his \u201cmoral standing\u201d has been\n\u201cdiminished\u201d (Zimmerman 1988: 38).\n\n\nOne need not endorse the idea of an actual moral ledger in\norder to hold a cognitive theory of blame. Pamela Hieronymi (2004),\nfor example, articulates a cognitive account of blame, where the\njudgment in question is a judgment that the blamed agent has shown the blamer (or\nanother) ill will. Since we care deeply about other people\u2019s judgments\nabout the quality of our wills, this judgment can also carry the\ndistinctive force of blame.\n\nDespite a number of supporters, there are many who are less sanguine\nabout the prospects of a purely cognitive account of blame. One\npotential problem for cognitive accounts is that they risk conflating\nblaming with judging blameworthy (Kenner 1967;\nCoates and Tognazzini 2012). After all, it seems quite possible to\njudge, for example, that another has displayed ill will or that they\nhave a mark against their moral ledger (and so, judge that they are\nblameworthy), without actually blaming that individual. The\nco-conspirator\u2019s recognition of the wrongness of a partner\u2019s criminal\nactivity might, in fact, underlie admiration for the partner\u2019s\nskillful execution of a heinous crime that most of us couldn\u2019t\nstomach. The fact that the same judgment could elicit such different\nresponses (repulsion and resentment in those of us who are committed\nto the values of morality and admiration in those who are not)\nsuggests that the judgment alone cannot constitute blame. More\nrecently, Hanna Pickard (2013) has argued that since it is possible to knowingly\nblame others inappropriately (i.e., to blame others even when we know\nthat they are not really blameworthy for their actions), the judgment\nthat another is blameworthy, or that they have shown ill will or\ndisregard, is not necessary for blame. It looks, then, that judgments\nof the sort discussed above are neither necessary nor sufficient for\nblame.\n\nA further problem for cognitive accounts is one suggested by Gary\nWatson (1987). According to Watson, attempts to identify or reduce\nblame exclusively to its cognitive components (recall that\nalthough Watson thinks that aretaic blame takes the form of judgments,\nit does not exhaust the phenomenon of blaming) make it seem \n\n\nas though in blaming we were mainly moral clerks, recording moral\nfaults \u2026 from a detached and austerely \u201cobjective\u201d\nstandpoint (1987 as reprinted in Watson 2004: 226\u201327).\n\n\nHere Watson argues that blame issues from the perspective of a participant in human\nrelationships, one in which we are not merely observing the moral\norder but are actively involved in a moral community. These sorts of\nconsiderations form the basis for emotional theories of blame. \n1.2 Emotional Theories of Blame\n\nDespite the fact that P. F. Strawson\u2019s \u201cFreedom and\nResentment\u201d (1962) contains little sustained discussion of blame\nas such, many take it to be the contemporary genesis of emotional\ntheories of blame. According to Strawson, our status as morally\nresponsible agents is grounded in the non-detached attitudes and\nemotions that are (in part) constitutive of ordinary interpersonal\nrelationships. Regarding others as morally responsible agents, for\nStrawson, is not a matter of judgment but of emotional response. (Note that according to cognitivist theories of the emotions, emotional\nstates are identified with a suite of judgments (Solomon 1993;\nNussbaum 2001). Thus, if the cognitivist theory of emotions were\ncorrect, there would be no fundamental difference between cognitive\nand emotional theories of blame. However, cognitivist theories of the\nemotions are very controversial, and so we will set this important\nquestion aside.)\n\nR. Jay Wallace (1994) has developed this idea into an account of\n\u201cholding responsible\u201d according to which we hold others\nmorally responsible just in case we experience resentment,\nindignation, or (in the self-regarding case) guilt as a response to\ntheir actions, or judge that such a response would be appropriate.\nThus, for Wallace, (a specific subset of) Strawson\u2019s \u201creactive\nattitudes\u201d are essentially implicated in the stance we take up\nwhen we hold others responsible. But though it is possible to take up\nthe stance of \u201cholding responsible\u201d without being\nemotionally exercised, Wallace stresses (and reiterates this in\nWallace 2011) that to actually blame an agent, one must be\nexercised emotionally. \n\nOf course, Strawson and Wallace are hardly alone in endorsing\nemotional theories of blame. While these \u201cStrawsonian\u201d\naccounts of blame focus on the reactive attitudes (particularly\nresentment, indignation, and guilt), other emotional theories of blame\nare more inclusive. Susan Wolf (2011), David Shoemaker (2015, 2017), and\nLeonhard Menges (2017), for example, defend accounts of blame that\nemphasize anger (in the case of Shoemaker, it\u2019s actually three\ndistinct species of anger). Similarly, Macalester Bell (2013a, 2013b)\nargues for a \u201chostile attitudes\u201d account of blame that\nincludes the attitude of contempt as a blaming attitude. Consequently,\nwhat holds emotional theories of blame together is not widespread\nagreement over which emotions constitute blame. Rather, it is a shared\ncommitment to thinking that to blame is to respond to others\u2019 actions\nwith a negative emotion.\n\nThough it\u2019s very plausible that we blame others by responding to their\nactions with anger, resentment, indignation, or even contempt, there\nare a number of objections to emotional theories of blame. George Sher\n(2006) argues that emotional responses are unnecessary for blame. For\nexample, Sher argues that we can blame a loved one without feeling\nnegative emotional reactions. So too, we can blame villains from whom\nwe are temporally distant without any emotional response. The thought\nhere is simply that it is possible to blame Nero for the burning of\nRome, even though we do not feel any resentment or indignation towards\nNero for his cruelty. In response, defenders of emotional theories\nmight simply argue that despite appearances, without the emotions, one\nis simply not blaming Nero but instead merely judging blameworthy (see\nWallace 1994, 2011). Alternatively, a defender of emotional theories\ncould argue (plausibly, but by no means uncontroversially) that one\ncan be in an emotional state even if one does not experience any felt\naffect.\n\nA second objection to emotional theories of blame might be called the\n\u201cforce objection\u201d. Pamela Hieronymi develops this\nobjection by noting that\n\n\nan affective accompaniment of a judgment would be a certain unpleasant\nemotional disturbance \u2026 but, the force of blame seems deeper, more\nserious or weightier (Hieronymi 2004: 121).\n\n\nThus, in Hieronymi\u2019s view, the normative force of blame must be grounded in the cognitive\nelements of blaming emotions, since it is these elements that are\nresponsive to and reflect our concern for morality. But if the force\nof blame is grounded in the cognitive elements of the emotion, then\nwhy wouldn\u2019t a judgment with the same content constitute an instance\nof blame? It seems that while emotions might be concomitant with\nblame, it is the cognitive element\u2014one that can be present even\nif the blamer is not emotionally exercised\u2014and not the emotion\nitself that constitutes one\u2019s blame. In response to this sort of\nobjection, Wallace (2011) has argued that the reactive emotions are\nnot superfluous add-ons to the judgment, but instead they serve to\nchange the meaning of the judgment, imbuing the judgment with the sort\nof expressive significance that is characteristic of blame and that\nwould otherwise be lacking from a mere judgment.\n\nMore recently, Miranda Fricker (2016) has argued that our blaming\npractices evince too much internal diversity to be so neatly\nidentified with the narrow set of attitudes that emotion theorists\nfocus on. Because blame in one context can vary so significantly from\nblame in another context\u2014self-blame is different than direct\nsecond-personal blame, and each of these forms of blame is importantly\ndifferent than third-party blame\u2014there is very little that is\npresent in all instances of blame. And surely no specific emotional\nexperience will be present in all cases. In response to this, Leonhard\nMenges (2017) has claimed that there is actually less diversity in our\nblaming practices than Fricker supposes, and that to the degree there\nis any diversity in how we blame, it does nothing to undermine the\nrationale for emotional accounts of blame.\n1.3 Conative Theories of Blame\n\nConative theories of blame emphasize motivational elements, like\ndesires and intentions, as essential to blame. Two of the most\ndeveloped extant theories of blame\u2014those due to George Sher\n(2006) and T. M. Scanlon (2008, 2013)\u2014fall in this category. And\nthough we will focus on these two theories, other conative theories\nare possible. \n1.3.1 Dispositions Around a Belief-Desire Pair\n\nAs mentioned above, George Sher (2006) is skeptical of emotional\ntheories of blame. However, he is also skeptical about accounts of\nblame that are merely cognitive. There is more to blame than a mere\njudgment that an agent has acted wrongly, but one need not be\nemotionally exercised in order to blame. Sher prefers a happy medium\nbetween these two widely accepted alternatives.\n\nAccording to Sher, what must be added to judgments of wrongness is a\nbackwards-looking desire \u201cthat the person in question not have\nperformed his past bad act\u201d (2006: 112). But it\u2019s not enough\nthat the blamer simply wish that the bad action not have happened; the\ndesire must be one that issues from the blamer\u2019s general commitment to\nmorality, since what we really want is that the wrongdoer not have\n\u201cexercised his own decision-making capacities in a certain\nway\u201d, and that \u201che have responded, or that he be disposed\nto respond, to what we consider a compelling moral reason\u201d\n(2006: 105). On the resulting view, when the cognitive component of\njudging blameworthy is accompanied by this desire, which reflects our\ngeneral commitment to morality, then we are blaming. (See also Arpaly\n2006 and Arpaly & Schroeder 2014 for a similar view, according to\nwhich blame requires having a conative orientation \u201cagainst the\nwrong or bad\u201d (Arpaly & Schroeder 2014: 161).) Moreover,\nSher argues that the belief-desire pair in question is itself the\nbasis of those affective and behavioral dispositions that are commonly\nassociated with blame. For example, a blamer\u2019s disposition to feel\nhostile attitudes like anger towards the agent and to also reprimand,\nrebuke, and seek apology are to be explained by the presence of the\nbelief-desire pair.\n\nDespite the elegance of Sher\u2019s view, it has generated a number of\ncritical replies. Pamela Hieronymi (2008) objects to the link between\nthe belief-desire pair and attendant affective and behavioral\ndispositions. To her mind, the link is too weak: though she accepts\nSher\u2019s claim that the belief-desire pair is essentially implicated in\none\u2019s general commitment to morality, she does not think he has\nadequately shown that the characteristic dispositions are implicated\nin the same way. After all, \u201csurely our commitment to morality\ncould be affirmed or clarified in ways that do not involve hostile\nbehavior or reproach\u201d (2008: 25). But if this is correct, then\nit looks like blame\u2019s characteristic dispositions need not be present, even in those who are genuinely and sincerely committed to moral\nnorms. As a result, Hieronymi concludes that Sher has failed to show\nthat blame\u2014which must involve such\ndispositions\u2014is essentially tied to a more general commitment to\nmorality.\n\nA second objection to Sher\u2019s view is due to Angela Smith (2008). Smith\nrejects Sher\u2019s claim that a desire component is part of what\nconstitutes an attitude as blame. To defend this, she invites us to\nconsider an ordinary case of blame, say the blame we feel for a\npolitician who leads us into a disastrous war. While we no doubt\ndesire that the politician hadn\u2019t led us into the war because we are\ngenerally committed to morality (and we therefore don\u2019t enjoy the\nsuffering of innocents), it is not clear how this desire is itself\npart of our blame. By Smith\u2019s lights, the desire component of the\nbelief-desire pair, like the attendant affective and behavioral\ndispositions, seems to be something that is above and beyond blame\nitself. In more recent work, Smith has also argued that in some cases,\nsay in \u201cthe reactions of a mother whose son is blameworthy for\n[a] crime\u201d (Smith 2013: 35), the relevant belief-desire pair\nmight be present without blame. Other challenges to Sher\u2019s theory\ninclude the worry that it is too \u201csanitized\u201d because it\ncompromises psychological realism by \u201cstripping away [blame\u2019s]\nunsavory features\u201d (McGeer 2013: 166).\n1.3.2 Attitude Adjustment in Response to Impairment\n\nT. M. Scanlon (2008) has developed an influential account of blame\nthat represents something of a shift from his earlier, more cognitive,\naccount (see Scanlon 1986). In developing this new account, Scanlon\u2019s\ninitial motivation is similar to that of Sher, since Scanlon thinks\nthat an adequate account of blame must fit somewhere between a mere\njudgment that another has acted in some objectionable way and\na sanction (of which expressed reactive emotions are but one\nparadigm case). But unlike Sher, Scanlon does not think that we can\navoid these (putatively) unattractive alternatives simply by\nsupplementing the belief that another has acted wrongly or badly with\na desire that they did not so act. Indeed, for Scanlon, the belief\nthat another has acted wrongly is not part of blame at all. Instead,\nthe cognitive component of blame is provided by a judgment that\nanother has acted in a way that impairs meaningful interpersonal\nrelations; this is a judgment of blameworthiness. (For Scanlon, blame\nis a response to the meaning of someone\u2019s actions, rather\nthan the permissibility of those actions. For more on this\ndistinction, see the first three chapters of Scanlon 2008.) But this\njudgment itself is insufficient for blame (for reasons similar to\nthose that Sher gives), so in addition to judging that the agent is\nblameworthy, blame requires you \u201cto take your\nrelationship with him or her to be modified in a way that [a judgment\nof blameworthiness] holds to be appropriate\u201d (Scanlon 2008:\n128\u201329). In other words, blaming someone involves not just the\nbelief that they have acted in a way that impairs your relationship\nwith them, but also, that you take yourself to have reasons to revise\nyour intentions and attitudes towards them, and accordingly that you\nrevise these intentions and attitudes on the basis of such reasons.\n\n\nLike Sher, then, Scanlon has provided an initially plausible account\nof what it is to blame. But also like Sher, his account has been\nwidely criticized. The most common line of criticism is best summed up\nby R. Jay Wallace\u2019s (2011) slogan that Scanlon\u2019s account \u201cleaves\nthe blame out of blame\u201d. More precisely, Wallace argues that\n\n\nblame has a quality of opprobrium that is not captured by the\nconsiderations about the normative significance of impaired\nrelationships that are at the center of Scanlon\u2019s approach (Wallace\n2011: 349; see also Mason 2011). \n\n\nSusan Wolf (2011) has also argued that in some cases, such as the case\nof a hot-headed but ultimately loving family, it seems that you can\nblame another without taking yourself to have impairments in your\nrelationship or attendant reasons to revise your intentions or\nattitudes towards that person. The characteristic features of\nScanlon\u2019s interpretation of blame, then, seem to be unnecessary. More\nrecently, Sher (2013) has argued that Scanlon\u2019s emphasis on\nrelationships is problematic. After all, many cases of wrongdoing\ninvolve strangers\u2014e.g., in most car thefts, the victim does not\nknow the criminal. Nevertheless, it still seems that it is possible to\nblame those with whom we have no standing relationship. So blame\ncannot essentially implicate interpersonal relationships. Scanlon, in\nresponse (2008, 2013), insists that all rational agents stand in the\n\u201cmoral relationship\u201d to one another. However, whether this\nkind of relationship is sufficient to explain the blame of strangers\nis unclear. And indeed, as Sher points out, even if there is some\nrelationship between a victim and the stranger who victimizes them,\nit\u2019s not clear that this relationship plays any role at all\nin grounding the blame.\n1.4 Functional Theories of Blame\n\nFunctional accounts of blame are analogous to functionalist theories\nof mental states or properties. Instead of identifying blame with any\nparticular attitude (like a judgment or emotion) or combination of\nattitudes (like a belief-desire pair), functional accounts of blame\nidentify blame by its functional role. This way of proceeding leaves\nopen the particular attitude or combination of attitudes that\nconstitute blame. In this way, functional accounts can be more\nflexible.\n\nAccording to one functional account of blame, the function of blame is\nprotest. In other words, what we\u2019re doing when we blame others is\nprotesting their actions or character. But this, of course, means that\nany number of attitudes or combination of attitudes could be\npresent in blame. Pamela Hieronymi (2001), Matthew Talbert (2012), and\nVictoria McGeer (2013) argue that reactive attitudes like resentment\n(and the expressions of these attitudes) serve as powerful forms of\nprotest. Angela Smith (2013), on the other hand, argues that when we\nmodify our attitudes and intentions as Scanlon envisions, but do so\nas a form of protest, then we are actually blaming. In other\nwords, for Smith, it\u2019s not enough that we modify our attitudes and\nintentions; the modification in question must serve a particular\nfunction, namely that of protest, to count as an instance of blame.\nAnd in order to count as a protest, it need not involve any particular\nemotional state. (See Franklin (2013) and Houston (1992) for more on\nthe way in which blame allows us to stand up for our values.)\n\nThere are at least two sources of concern for those theories that take\nprotest to be the function of blame. First, it\u2019s not clear that\nprotest is independent of blame, such that one could specify what it\nis to protest without appealing to blaming attitudes. But if this is\nso, it\u2019s not clear that appealing to the notion of protest will help\nus clarify the nature of blame. Second, protest seems paradigmatically\nexpressed. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to make sense of unexpressed\nprotest. Do workers protest unfair labor conditions simply through\ntheir beliefs or attitudes? Or must they make such beliefs and\nattitudes known? And if it is the latter, then it\u2019s not clear that\nprotest could be the function of blame. After all, not all blame is\nexpressed. These objections are not decisive, of course, but they do suggest that there is more work to be done in defense of protest views to help us better understand what the nature of protest is, such that appeals to protest can provide a non-circular account of blame. \n\nOf course, there might be other functions of blame: to express or\ncommunicate condemnation or disapproval, for example. Michael McKenna\n(2012, 2013) has argued for such an account. In fact, he has claimed\nthat blame is conversational, and thus functions to continue\na conversation started by the blamee\u2019s wrongful action. In particular,\nMcKenna claims that the reactive attitudes and their expressions serve\nthis function. Antony Duff has proposed a similar understanding of the\naim of blame, according to which it is \n\n\nan attempt to communicate to the wrong-doer a moral understanding of\nhis wrong-doing; to bring him to recognize his guilt and repent what\nhe has done (Duff 1986: 70).\n\n\nAlong these lines Coleen Macnamara (2011, 2015) has also argued that\nour practices of holding others morally responsible more generally (a\nset of practices that includes blame) are communicative in their\nfunction. In a similar vein, Christopher Bennett (2013) claims that\nblame functions symbolically to express our disapproval. Like Smith,\nhe develops this account by supplementing Scanlon\u2019s theory of blame,\nbut it seems that one could adapt Bennett\u2019s expressive apparatus even\noutside of a Scanlonian framework, since the distinctive aspect of it\nis that it expresses something important about our stance\ntowards the blamee\u2019s actions. Most recently, Miranda Fricker (2016)\nclaims that communicative blame, which identifies and communicates\nfaults, is the paradigmatic case of blame.\n\nBecause of their relative newness to the scene, there is not much\ncriticism of these views. However, one potential problem with these\nviews is that many (perhaps most) instances of blame are not expressed\nor communicated. In what sense are those instances of blame\ncommunicative? And if they are not, how can blame be essentially\ncommunicative in its nature? Gary Watson suggests that resentment is\n\u201cincipiently communicative\u201d and says that \u201cin some\nelusive sense, resentment is \u2018meant to be\nexpressed\u2019\u201d (Watson 2011: 328). (That sense remains\nelusive, but see McKenna (2012) and Macnamara (2015) for more discussion.)\n2. When is Blame Appropriate?\n\nBlame is easily abused and misused, so a complete understanding of the\nphenomenon will require looking not just at what blame is but\nalso when it\u2019s appropriate. (We use \u2018appropriate\u2019\nas a broad normative term to cover all sorts of evaluations, such as\nwhether any particular instance of blame is fitting, warranted,\npermissible, required, effective, and so on.) As Miranda Fricker puts\nit: \u201cLike most things in life, our practice of blame is\nsusceptible to the vices of being done from the wrong sort of motive,\nin the wrong degree, in the wrong way, or with the wrong sort of\nobject\u201d (Fricker 2016: 168). This list provides a nice initial\ntaxonomy of ways that blame can go awry: an ethics of blame will need\nto take into consideration (a) facts about the blamer, (b) facts about\nthe blaming interaction itself, and (c) facts about the person being\nblamed. (We\u2019re lumping \u201cin the wrong degree\u201d together with\n\u201cin the wrong way\u201d, since disproportionality will be one\nway in which the blaming interaction can be problematic.) Keep in\nmind, too, that how you answer the question of what blame is\nwill influence these ethical questions, since the propriety conditions\nof a judgment are plausibly distinct from the propriety conditions of\na rebuke. Because we are not here endorsing a particular theory of\nblame, our characterization of the norms in question will operate at a\nlevel of abstraction that floats free of substantive commitments\nconcerning the nature of blame. (It\u2019s also worth noting that the\nconditions on appropriate blame outlined below may perhaps be\nlegitimately ignored if the stakes are high enough and the likely\nconsequences of blame so valuable. In other words, there may be cases\nwhere it is appropriate to blame for the \u2018wrong\u2019 sort of\nreason. We set these cases aside for the purposes of our\ndiscussion.)\n2.1 Facts about the Person Being Blamed\n\nBegin by considering potentially relevant facts about the person who\nis being blamed. A natural answer to the question of when blame is\nappropriate is to say that blame is only appropriate when the person\nblamed is in fact blameworthy. This may sound at first like\nan unhelpful tautology\u2014after all, what could it mean to be\nworthy of blame if not simply that you can be appropriately\nblamed?\u2014but the emphasis on worthiness is meant to draw\nattention to the fact that it\u2019s only appropriate to blame a person\nwhen they have earned it or when they deserve it.\nThat is, only when certain facts about the person being\nblamed are in place. Which facts? What does one have to do to\nearn blame?\n2.1.1 Moral Agency\n\nAs we noted in section 1 above, being to blame (i.e.,\ncausally responsible; see Beardsley 1969 and Kenner 1967) is not\nsufficient for being blameworthy because often, the best or\nmost salient causal explanation doesn\u2019t even involve a moral agent at\nall. Earthquakes and mosquitoes can be to blame for various negative\noutcomes, but neither can be blameworthy because neither can, as Gary\nWatson puts it, \u201cact effectively and competently in moral\nmatters\u201d (2013a: 3322). Only certain creatures are even\ncandidates for blame in the first place, and though it is a matter of\nsome controversy which precise capacities are required, the list\ncertainly includes the capacities for reflection, deliberation,\ndecision-making, and self-determination. But earthquakes and\nmosquitoes are the easy cases; the harder cases are children and\npsychopaths, individuals who haven\u2019t (or haven\u2019t yet) developed an\nunderstanding of or an appreciation for moral norms. These\nindividuals, it seems, can still act in morally significant\nways\u2014indeed, in ways we would naturally describe as cruel and\neven evil\u2014but whether they can earn moral blame (as opposed\nmerely to giving us good reason to protect ourselves from them) is a\nvexed question (see Watson 2011 and Shoemaker 2015 for insightful\ndiscussion). But regardless of how one answers that question, it is\nwidely accepted that potentially blameworthy agents must be capable of\nreflecting upon, reasoning about, and executing a decision about how\nto behave. If someone lacks these capacities, they are\nexempted from blame.\n2.1.2 Freedom and Responsibility\n\nIn addition to having the general capacity for practical reasoning,\nhowever, it is often thought that an individual is appropriately\nblamed only if they had (and, on the occasion, exercised) free will.\nThe excuse \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it\u201d or \u201cI was forced to\ndo it\u201d is often sufficient to render blame inappropriate, so\nit\u2019s a natural thought that someone can only be blamed for those\nthings that they could have helped, or weren\u2019t\nforced into\u2014in other words, for those things that they chose of\ntheir own free will. (But note that this is primarily a condition applied\nto actions for which one is thought to be blameworthy. Taking\nseriously the possibility that we can be blameworthy for our attitudes\nas well might naturally lead one to downplay the importance of free\nwill, or reconceive what it involves. See, for example, Smith 2005.)\nTypically, free will is thought of as a sort of control: as\nthe ability to control (by selecting) which of two possible futures\nobtains, for example, or as the ability to control (by guiding) one\u2019s\nactions in light of one\u2019s considered judgments about what one ought to\ndo. (See van Inwagen 1983; Fischer 1994; Nelkin 2011; Franklin 2018.)\nThe question of whether control of the right\nsort is compatible with determinism has proven to be a difficult one to answer; hence it\u2019s a difficult question\nwhether blame would ever be appropriate in a deterministic world.\nThere are less sweeping threats to freedom, however. We are all\nvulnerable to coercion, manipulation, situational pressures, and\nvarying degrees of temptation or compulsion, and the extent to which\nthese factors rob us of our freedom is the extent to which we may not be deserving of blame.\n\nIf you add the capacity for practical reasoning to the right sort of\ncapacities for control (which will likely include not just volitional\ncapacities but cognitive capacities, too), you end up with a morally\nresponsible agent\u2014that is to say, an individual who has the\ncapacities that render them a sensible target of blame (see Fischer\n& Ravizza 1998; Vargas 2013). If, in performing a morally reprehensible action, they exercise those capacities, then they are morally\nresponsible for that action\u2014that is to say, they are a\nsensible target of blame for that action (they are neither exempted\nnor excused from our blaming practices).\n\nThere are further subtleties here, but they are inessential to the\nmain point, which is simply that most theorists think that it is only\nappropriate to blame someone if they have certain capacities for\ncontrol, practical reasoning, moral understanding, etc., and exercised\nthem on the occasion in question. (One of the subtleties is that even\nif an agent satisfies all the relevant control conditions, they may\nstill fail to be responsible if they fail to meet an independent\nepistemic condition. Non-culpable ignorance (perhaps even culpable ignorance) of the consequences of one\u2019s actions seems to excuse bad behavior as much as lack of control. See Ginet 2000, Mele 2011, and Robichaud & Wieland 2017.) Likewise, most\ntheorists think that if someone has and exercises these capacities,\nthen they are blameworthy\u2014that is, they have earned\nblame. But just because someone has earned blame doesn\u2019t mean that\nblame is necessarily the right response. To see why, let\u2019s turn now to\nfacts about the blaming interaction itself.\n2.2 Facts about the Blaming Interaction\n\nEven if someone is blameworthy, not just any blaming\ninteraction is called for. If we think of blame as a\n\u201cmove\u201d made through moral space, or as a contribution to a\nmoral conversation (see McKenna 2012), then one dimension of normative\nquestions will concern the moves or messages that are called for. We\nmight think of these as procedural norms (Coates and\nTognazzini 2012).\n2.2.1 Proportionality\n\nAnalogous to the common thought that the punishment must fit the\ncrime, it is plausible to suppose that the blame must, in some\nsense, fit the transgression. Perhaps it\u2019s legitimate to be annoyed at\nyour friend for forgetting your birthday one year, but you shouldn\u2019t (at\nleast in the absence of some special context) vow never to speak to\nthem again as a result of that one lapse. What will count as a\nproportional blaming response to a transgression will no doubt vary\nwith different relationships and different transgressions, but there\nwill likely always be some responses that take the transgression too\nseriously, and some that don\u2019t take it seriously enough.\n\nWhat counts as a proportional blaming response won\u2019t depend just on\nthe nature of the transgression, though; it will likely also depend on\nthe way the wrongdoer has responded to their own transgression. As\nAngela Smith puts it:\n\n\nIf someone has an objectionable attitude toward me, for example, but\nis already reproaching herself for it and making efforts to change,\nthen I may judge that I have no reason to adopt or express any blaming\nattitudes toward her at all. Her own self-reproach shows me that she\nalready recognizes that I have moral standing and deserve better\ntreatment, and therefore I may no longer see her attitude as posing a\nchallenge to me or my status. In cases of this sort, the faulty\nattitude is still attributable to the agent and she is open to\nlegitimate moral criticism for it; but the agent is already responding\nappropriately to this fact and therefore there may be no grounds for\nfurther criticism on the part of others (Smith 2007: 482).\n\n\nRelatedly, in the case of third-party blame\u2014where your blame is\ndirected at someone who has wronged someone else\u2014there are\nprocedural questions concerning how the intensity of your blame\nmatches up with the intensity of the blame from the person who was\nwronged. If I suspect that your failure to blame someone who has\nwronged you stems from a lack of self-respect or a lack of feeling\nempowered, then perhaps I can appropriately be more outraged than you\nare. But in other cases it seems as though I need to temper my blame\nin light of how you yourself view the wrong that has been done to you.\nFor example, what if you have forgiven the wrongdoer? Does that by\nitself render third-party blame out of order? Maura Priest (2016)\nsuggests that we distinguish between \u201cSpectator Blame\u201d and\n\u201cAssociate Blame\u201d to help deal with this issue. While\nforgiveness might render blaming on behalf of the victim\ninappropriate, there is still a more detached form of blame that could\nbe appropriately maintained. \n2.2.2 Epistemic Considerations\n\nImaginary philosophical examples are always told by an omniscient\nnarrator, but of course real-life cases of blame are never like that,\nand we have to rely on our fallible judgments about the obscure\nmotivations of other human beings. Sometimes we are confident that\nsomeone has done wrong; other times we let our anger hamper our\nimagination and our generosity in searching for possible excuses for\napparent wrongdoing. Having too quick a temper is itself something for\nwhich one can be open to criticism, and what makes a temper count as\ntoo quick is often that it outstrips the evidence for\nwrongdoing. The realm of interpersonal blame is not perfectly\nanalogous to the realm of legal responsibility, of course, so\n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d may be too demanding a\nrequirement, but nevertheless there is some epistemic standard that\nmust be met before blame is appropriate, even if the potential target\nof blame is in fact blameworthy (this point is developed in more\ndetail by D. Justin Coates (2016)).\n\nGideon Rosen has also appealed to epistemic considerations on blame,\nexcept he uses them to argue for a general sort of skepticism about\nmoral responsibility:\n\n\nWhat must you think in order to judge that Bill, for example, is\nresponsible for lying to his wife? You must think that at the time of\naction, either he knew that he had decisive reason not to lie, or if\nhe did not know this, that his ignorance was the upshot of some prior\nbad action done in full knowledge of every pertinent fact or norm. You\nmust think, in other words, that his bad action either is, or derives\nfrom, an episode of genuine, full-strength akrasia.\n\nI suggest that given the opacity of the mind\u2014of other minds and\neven of one\u2019s own mind\u2014it is almost always unreasonable to place\nsignificant confidence in such a judgment (Rosen 2004: 308).\n\n\nRosen\u2019s skepticism here relies on arguments presented earlier in his\narticle for the conclusion that the epistemic requirements on moral\nresponsibility are quite stringent (in order for ignorance to be\nculpable, it must eventually trace back to clear-eyed akratic action;\nsee also Levy 2011), but for our purposes the important point is\nsimply that \u201cthe opacity of mind\u201d, as Rosen puts it, can\nmake it hard to tell when someone is genuinely blameworthy, and thus\ncan render unjustified the judgment of wrongdoing on which appropriate\nblame rests. Of course, one need not accept Rosen\u2019s skeptical\nconclusion to agree that blamers must not jump to conclusions about\nwrongdoing.\n2.3 Facts about the Blamer\n\nEven if some agent is blameworthy, and even if no procedural norm\nwould be violated, it\u2019s not the case (or, at least, not\nalways the case) that everyone can blame. As Roger Wertheimer\npoints out,\n\n\nsome matters\u2014like other folks\u2019 intimate intrafamilial\nrelations\u2014may be none of your business, not your affair, no\n(proper) concern of yours, so, whatever your evidence and emotions, it\nis not your place to bear ill will (Wertheimer 1998: 499).\n\n\nG. A. Cohen echoes the sentiment from a different perspective:\n\n\n[Moral] admonition may be sound, and in place, but some may be poorly\nplaced to offer it. When a person replies to a critic by saying:\n\u201cWhere do you get off criticizing me for\nthat?\u201d, she is not denying (or, of course, affirming)\nthe inherent soundness of the critic\u2019s criticism. She is denying her\ncritic\u2019s right to make that criticism, in a posture of judgment (Cohen\n2006: 118).\n\n\nThe general idea here is that there may be facts about the person who\nis expressing blame that make their blame inappropriate. It\u2019s not their place,\nthey aren\u2019t well positioned, they don\u2019t have the authority, and so on.\nMarilyn Friedman (2013: 272) puts the point nicely by saying that not\neveryone is blamerworthy. To continue with the legal analogy\nfrom above: whereas the blaming interaction raises questions of\nprocedure, we might think of facts about the blamer as giving\nrise to questions about jurisdiction. Granted that the\nwrongdoer is blameworthy and that the blaming procedures would be in\norder, who exactly can enact those procedures? \n2.3.1 Standing\n\nThere has recently been an explosion of work on the so-called\nstanding to blame, which is often taken to be the primary\nfact about the blamer that is relevant to whether an instance of blame\nis appropriate. Hypocritical blame is usually treated as a paradigm\nexample, and the most basic thought is simply that there seems to be\nsomething inappropriate about blame issued by a blamer who is guilty\nof the same transgression to which they are reacting. The standard way\nof talking about what\u2019s going wrong in this sort of case is to use the\nlabel \u2018standing\u2019: the hypocritical blamer lacks the\nstanding to blame. But before we look closer at the notion of standing\nin general, and hypocrisy in particular, it\u2019s worth making a brief\nnote about terminology.\n\nNot everyone who writes about standing uses the term in the same way.\nAs best we can tell, there are three distinct usages of the term, and\nthis has resulted in theorists sometimes talking past each other.\nEveryone seems to agree that \u2018standing\u2019 is a label to be\napplied to some fact about the blamer that enables appropriate blame\n(or, more modestly, that \u2018lack of standing\u2019 is a label to\nbe applied to some fact about the blamer that renders blame\ninappropriate). But from that common foundation, usage diverges.\n\nFor some, \u2018standing\u2019 is a term that indicates any\ncondition about the blamer that is relevant to appropriate blame.\nIn this broad sense, the notion of standing serves as a way to mark a\ncontrast with facts about the blamed person, such as whether\nthe blamed person is blameworthy. To invoke Friedman\u2019s terminology\nagain: the notion of standing is sometimes applied broadly to anything\nthat pertains to whether a blamer is blamerworthy. But other theorists\nuse the term in a narrower way.\n\nFor others, standing is more specifically tied to whatever it is\nthat makes hypocritical blame inappropriate. We said above that\nhypocritical blame is often treated as a paradigm case of standingless\nblame, so it makes sense that some theorists would see the case of the\nhypocrite as what provides content to the notion of standing. Other\ninstances of standingless blame would then be other scenarios that are\nrelevantly similar to whatever is happening in the case of the\nhypocrite. This way of understanding standing leaves open the\npossibility that there may be some facts about the blamer that are\nindependent of standing but which render blame inappropriate.\n\nFinally, there are those who associate the notion of standing with a\nparticular objection that the blamed person can apparently\nsometimes raise. In particular, in response to hypocritical or\nmeddlesome blame (to take two common examples), it seems like the\nperson being blamed can sometimes appropriately dismiss the blame (or,\nperhaps better, silence the blamer) with the retort: \u201cWho are\nyou to blame me for that?\u201d. In this sort of exchange, the\nthought goes, the person being blamed is challenging the standing of\nthe blamer. For those who take this view of the notion of standing,\nthe only facts about the blamer that count as the standing facts are\nthose whose absence would underwrite the legitimacy of this \u201cwho\nare you?\u201d response.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that all three of these questions\u2014(1) what\nblamer-based facts are relevant to the propriety of blame and why, (2)\nwhat goes wrong in cases of hypocritical blame, and (3) what\nblamer-based facts are relevant to the legitimacy of the \u201cwho\nare you?\u201d charge\u2014are worth asking, and will likely have overlapping\nanswers. But there\u2019s a serious risk of misunderstanding if we don\u2019t\ndistinguish among these questions. Since hypocrisy plays such a\ncentral role in recent scholarship on these questions, we\u2019ll begin\nthere.\n2.3.2 Hypocrisy\n\nAt least sometimes, we blame others with the aim of getting them to\nsee the error of their ways and change their behavior in the future.\nOne sure way to fail at this is to be guilty of the very same (or a\nrelevantly similar) transgression as the one you are condemning. The\nhypocritical blamer is perhaps the paradigm example of someone whose\nblame somehow goes awry. For one thing, it\u2019s unlikely that\nhypocritical blame will be effective (see Dworkin 2000; Roadevin\n2018), but the problem seems to go deeper than that. (Another way to\nput it: hypocritical blame would still be problematic even if it\nwere effective.) In line with the distinctions we made at the\nend of the last section, let\u2019s separate two questions here: first,\nwhat\u2019s wrong with hypocritical blame, and second, what is the nature\nof the \u201cwho are you\u201d rebuttal of hypocritical blame. \n\nSo, first: what precisely is the problem with hypocritical\nblame? (See Szabados and Soifer 2004 for a book length treatment of\nthe ethics of hypocrisy in general.) The answer to this question will\nlikely depend on the nature of blame. R. Jay Wallace, for example, who\nadvocates a Strawsonian account of blame, explains the problem with\nhypocrisy by an appeal to the underlying commitments of the reactive\nattitudes. For Wallace (2010: 326), \u201cblame carries with it a\nkind of practical commitment to critical self-scrutiny\u201d, a\ncommitment that the hypocritical blamer fails to live up to. Given\nthat \u201cwe all have an interest in being protected from the kind\nof social disapproval and opprobrium that are involved in\nblame\u201d, the hypocritical blamer\u2014as long as they aren\u2019t\nalso blaming themselves, in which case they might not count as\nhypocritical\u2014treats their own interest in avoiding blame as more\nimportant than the interest of the target of their blame. As Wallace\nputs it (2010: 328): \u201cThis offends against a presumption in\nfavor of the equal standing of persons that I take to be fundamental\nto moral thought\u201d. Thus, for Wallace, the problem with\nhypocritical blame is that it is morally wrong (and thus inappropriate\neven if the target is blameworthy). Kyle Fritz and Daniel Miller\n(2018) also think that hypocritical blaming is morally objectionable\nbecause it involves an unfair \u201cdifferential blaming\ndisposition\u201d, which \u201ccontravenes the equality of\npersons\u201d (2018: 123). They argue that their account, unlike\nWallace\u2019s, can account not only for what\u2019s objectionable about\nhypocritical moral address, but also for why even\nunexpressed hypocritical blame is morally problematic.\n\nT. M. Scanlon, on the other hand, takes blame to be an adjustment of\nattitudes in response to an impaired relationship, so the problem with\nhypocritical blame is that it distorts the facts. The adjustment of\nattitudes and expectations that constitutes blame purports to be a\nresponse to some way in which the blamed person has impaired their\nrelationship with the blamer. But, as Scanlon says (2008: 177),\n\u201cthere is something false in [the hypocritical blamer\u2019s]\nsuggesting that it is [the blamee\u2019s] unwillingness to act in ways that\nindicate untrustworthiness that impairs [their] moral\nrelationship,\u201d since the past attitudes and actions of the\nhypocritical blamer already impaired the relevant\nrelationship. Thus, for Scanlon, we might say that the problem with\nhypocritical blame is that it is unfitting (or untrue to the\nfacts).\n\nEven if hypocritical blame is unfitting and/or unfair, it\u2019s not\nobvious how that would help us to make sense of the \u201cwho are\nyou\u201d charge that motivates so much recent work on standing. When\nI challenge your credentials to cast blame by accusing you of\nhypocrisy, I\u2019m not simply trying to tell you that you are doing\nsomething morally wrong, nor that you are making false assumptions.\nAlthough those would presumably count as reasons to cease blaming, the\n\u201cwho are you\u201d charge is more pointed than the claim that\nthe blamer has a reason to stop. Instead, it seems like I am trying to\nsilence your blame in some way. (It\u2019s this further thought\nthat drives Macalester Bell\u2019s (2013a) skepticism about the idea of\nstanding.) Our second question, then, is how exactly to make sense of\nthe \u201cwho are you\u201d charge when applied to a hypocritical\nblamer.\n\nThere are two general proposals for making sense of the way in which\nhypocrisy seems to make a blamer lose their moral voice, so to speak.\nWe saw above that Fritz & Miller largely agree with Wallace that\nhypocritical blaming is unfair because the hypocrite harbors a\n\u201cdifferential blaming disposition\u201d. But they go a step\nfurther by suggesting that the normative upshot of the\nunfairness of hypocritical blame is that the blamer \u201cforfeits\nthe right to blame others\u201d for violations of the norm with\nrespect to which the hypocrisy arises (Fritz & Miller 2018: 125).\nThis thought fits quite naturally with some ways in which the\n\u201cwho are you\u201d charge tends to be formulated. When I ask\nthe rhetorical question, \u201cWho are you to blame me?\u201d,\nperhaps what I\u2019m trying to say is that although others may\nhave the right to blame me for this transgression, you do not\nhave such a right. Your hypocrisy has taken it from you. However, even this might be too strong. Perhaps your hypocrisy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve forfeited your right to blame, but only that you have a distinctive pro tanto reason to refrain from blaming. Since blame\u2013even hypocritical blame\u2013can sometimes be morally imperative, this reason won\u2019t always be decisive. But its existence might suffice to explain the sense that the hypocrite is in some sense overstepping her bounds in many instances. \n\nOf course, you might worry about supposing that there is such a thing\nas a general right or entitlement to blame in the first place. Matt\nKing (forthcoming) argues on these grounds in favor of skepticism\nabout the notion of standing. According to King, there is nothing\ndistinctive about the \u201cwho are you\u201d charge, and he offers\nan account of what goes wrong with hypocritical blame by appealing not\nto the idea of standing but instead to the idea that the\nhypocrite is violating norms of priority (or perhaps norms of\ninvolvement) that specify where our critical focus ought to be. The\nhypocrite\u2019s focus is in the wrong place, and this provides the\nhypocrite with a weighty moral reason not to blame. \n\nThe second proposal, recently developed by Ori Herstein, for making\nsense of the \u201cwho are you\u201d charge doesn\u2019t appeal to a\ngeneral right to blame, but instead begins from the insight that\nblaming is, in part, an attempt to give reasons to the person\nbeing blamed\u2014reasons to stop what they are doing, to apologize,\nto acknowledge wrongdoing. Even without being blamed, a wrongdoer\nwould presumably have these reasons, but what blame does is add\nanother type of reason to the mix\u2014specifically, a directive\nreason. This richer account of the blaming transaction opens up a\nnew way of understanding the \u201cwho are you\u201d charge. In\nHerstein\u2019s view, although a hypocritical blamer does still issue a\nvalid directive through their blame, that directive can nevertheless\nbe permissibly ignored \u201cwithout substantive deliberation on\n[its] merits\u201d (Herstein 2017: 3110). \n2.3.3 Other Blamer-Based Worries\n\nAlthough hypocrisy is the most frequently discussed blamer-based fact\nthat would render blame problematic, there are certainly others worth\nexploring. Here we\u2019ll briefly discuss four: complicity, meddling,\nmoral luck, and claimant injustice.\n\nTo charge someone with blaming hypocritically is to allege that they\nare blaming (or, at least, pretending to blame) in response to\ntransgressions similar to those (or perhaps type-identical to those)\nthat they have committed in the past. A somewhat related charge, but\nworth distinguishing, is the claim that the blamer is somehow\nobjectionably involved in the very act that they are, at this very\nmoment, condemning. This is to charge the blamer with\ncomplicity, and such a charge might take many forms. G. A.\nCohen (2006: 126) gives a nice sample: \u201cyou ordered me to do it,\nyou asked me to do it, you forced me to do it, you left me with no\nreasonable alternative, you gave me the means to do it\u201d. The\nsuperior officer who orders a subordinate to do something morally\nreprehensible is not in a position to blame the subordinate for\ncarrying out the order, even if civilians are. And this is not\nnecessarily because the superior officer has done similar things in\nthe past, but instead because they are too closely involved in the\nvery act they are purporting to condemn.\n\nThe issue of complicity has recently been discussed in connection with\nwhether the state has the standing to blame certain\ncriminals. Gary Watson (2015) and Gustavo A. Beade (forthcoming) each\nraise worries about the fact that criminality is correlated with\ncertain social disadvantages that the state itself may be responsible\nfor. If complicity in wrongdoing undermines the standing to blame, and\nif the state is\u2014as seems plausible\u2014at least partly\nresponsible for the social conditions that partly explain criminal behavior,\nthen it suddenly becomes unclear that the state is in a position to\npunish certain law-breakers. (Watson also considers the more worrisome\nconclusion that certain disadvantaged criminals aren\u2019t even bound by\nthe laws in the first place, due to the structural disadvantages in\nwhich the state is complicit.)\n\nAlthough it is helpful for some purposes to distinguish hypocrisy from\ncomplicity, it may be that at a more fundamental level they are\nproblematic for the same reason. This is the view that Patrick Todd\n(2012, forthcoming) advocates. According to Todd, the reason we can\nraise the \u201cwho are you\u201d charge against both hypocrites and\nthose who are complicit in our wrongdoing is that in both cases, the\nblamer\u2019s own behavior demonstrates a lack of commitment to the\nrelevant moral norm.\n\nEven if a blamer isn\u2019t a hypocrite and isn\u2019t involved in the action\nthey are condemning, their blame can nevertheless be inappropriate if\nthe wrong in question is just none of their business. Linda\nRadzik gives a nice description of our common moral attitudes toward\nthese situations:\n\n\nFor example, a group of co-workers will often insist that the romantic\ninfidelity of one of their members is none of their business (and then\nfeel a bit ashamed when they continue to gossip about it). Neighbors\nand teachers hesitate to interfere with a parent\u2019s treatment of her\nchild although they judge the treatment to be wrongful, unless the\nwrong reaches a certain level of severity. Even within close\nrelationships, we are sometimes uncertain whether we should express\nour negative moral judgment of a friend\u2019s behavior. True, the\nhesitancy to sanction in these cases is sometimes based on laziness,\nself-interest, cowardice or uncertainty about the moral judgments at\nissue, none of which contradict the claim that we have the standing to\nsanction. But, at other times, our hesitancy seems to be based on the\nsense that it would be wrong to sanction. We say, \u201cIt\nisn\u2019t my place to interfere even though I can see what she is doing is\nwrong\u201d. We do not feel entitled to sanction every wrongdoer for\nevery wrong (Radzik 2011: 582).\n\n\nAnd the thought, of course, is that we do not feel entitled\nto sanction every wrongdoer for every wrong because we aren\u2019t\nso entitled. Radzik describes three situations in which only a limited\ngroup of individuals could appropriately blame: (1) cases where agents\nwrong themselves, (2) cases where the wrong is \u201ccommitted within\nspecial relationships, such as romantic partnerships, familial bonds,\nand friendships\u201d (2011: 593), and (3) cases where third-party\nblame \u201cwould interfere with the victim\u2019s ability to find\nvindication in the aftermath of wrongdoing\u201d (2011: 597).\n\nIt\u2019s a good question exactly why appropriate blame would be\nrestricted only to certain individuals in these sorts of case. Perhaps\nthere are norms of privacy at play (Smith 2007; Nagel 1998), or\nperhaps there\u2019s an illuminating analogy to be made here with the\nnotion of standing in the law (Sabini and Silver 1982, though see also\nBell 2013a and King forthcoming), or perhaps if we see blame as a\nresponse which presupposes that the person blamed is in some way\naccountable to the members of their moral community, then we\ncan distinguish between several (overlapping) moral communities, only\nsome of which any one person belongs to, and thus only some of which\nunderwrite one\u2019s ability to blame appropriately (Duff 2010: 126). If\nwe adopt Scanlon\u2019s recent account of blame (2008), then perhaps we can\nsay that some wrongs are none of our business because they don\u2019t\nimpair any of our relationships, and hence don\u2019t render\nappropriate any blame-constituting modifications in those\nrelationships. (The so-called \"Business Condition\" on appropriate\nblame\u2014that blame is inappropriate if the wrong is none of your business\u2014is another place where it is helpful to distinguish the question\nof why meddlesome blame is problematic from the question of the\nprecise nature of the \"who are you\" charge that might be raised by the\nperson being blamed.)\n\nMoral luck (in all its forms) provides another perspective from\nwhich to see how blame might be inappropriate. Consider Gary Watson\u2019s\n(1987) influential discussion of Robert Harris, who is at once an\nunequivocally cruel murderer and also, in a real sense, a victim of\nhis tragic formative circumstances. It\u2019s a legitimate question, given\nhis history, whether Harris is even the sort of creature who is a\nsensible target of blame - that is, whether Harris is even a morally\nresponsible agent in the first place - but even if we grant that he\nis, there\u2019s another potential obstacle to blame at work here. Watson\nexpresses it like this:\n\n\nThe fact that Harris\u2019s cruelty is an intelligible response to his\ncircumstances gives a foothold not only for sympathy, but for the\nthought that if I had been subjected to such circumstances, I\nmight well have become as vile. What is unsettling is the thought that\none\u2019s moral self is such a fragile thing. One tends to think of one\u2019s\nmoral sensibilities as going deeper than that (though it is not clear\nwhat this means). This thought induces not only an ontological\nshudder, but a sense of equality with the other: I too am a potential\nsinner (Watson 1987, as reprinted in Watson 2004: 245).\n\n\nThe obstacle to blame that Watson is describing here is not the\nthought that Harris might not be blameworthy (though he might not be),\nbut rather the thought expressed well by the phrase \u201cThere but\nfor the grace of God go I\u201d. It\u2019s a humbling perspective to take\non one\u2019s agency, one that may \u201ctaint one\u2019s own view of one\u2019s\nmoral self as an achievement\u201d (2004: 246), and make one feel\nthat \u201cindignation on one\u2019s part would be self-righteous and\nindulgent\u201d (2004: 254). For want of a better term, we might say\nthat this is a worry about subjunctive hypocrisy, since it\ncertainly has a similar flavor to the hypocrisy worry discussed above.\nThe thought is something like this: \u201cIf I were as bad as him,\nI\u2019d have no standing to blame him. But the difference between us is\nsimply a matter of luck, and surely my good moral luck can\u2019t serve as\nthe basis for my moral standing to blame. So I lack the standing to\nblame even though I\u2019ve never done the terrible things in\nquestion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning one final fact about the blamer that can\ncomplicate a blaming interaction, though this one fits less well into\nthe framework we\u2019ve been exploring because it\u2019s not something that\nmakes blame inappropriate so much as it is something that\nmakes blame unheard. We have in mind an idea introduced by\nVanessa Carbonell (forthcoming), which she dubs \u201cclaimant\ninjustice\u201d. According to Carbonell, claimant injustice\n\u201c\u2026occurs when social prejudices or structural inequalities\nundermine a moral agent\u2019s ability to engage in felicitous moral\naddress\u2014to make moral claims, to call out wrongdoing, to judge\nor condemn others for their action, to hold responsible, to seek\nredress, to blame or punish, to participate in any of the social\npractices associated with the participant and vicarious reactive\nattitudes\u201d (forthcoming: 16). The idea here is that the very\npower to engage in moral address is something that requires a social\ncontext where the blamer is recognized as (and believes themselves to\nbe) a valid source of moral claims, but this context can be absent for\nmembers of marginalized groups, thus rendering them unable to hold\nmembers of dominant groups responsible. Thus it may be that yet\nanother fact about the blamer\u2014the fact that they are\nmarginalized\u2014can render blame infelicitous. (See Hornsby 1995 for related discussion.) Again, it\u2019s not that\ntheir blame is dismissed so much as simply not heard as\nmoral address in the first place.\n2.4 Varieties of Blame\n\nBecause the nature of blame is controversial, we have tended in this\nsection simply to use the word \u201cblame\u201d, but it\u2019s important\nto remember that one\u2019s views about the ethics of blame will very much\ndepend on what one takes blame to be. For instance, although\nhypocritical moral address (to use Wallace\u2019s term) seems clearly to\nunderwrite the legitimacy of a \"who are you\" charge, it is less clear\nwhether merely harboring a hypocritical blaming judgment is likewise\ninappropriate, or inappropriate in quite the same way. In general, the\ndifference between expressed and unexpressed blame\nis an important distinction to keep in mind when theorizing about the\nways in which blame can go wrong (see Fritz and Miller 2018; Todd\nforthcoming). \n\nMoreover, blame seems to be just one among many ways that we respond\nto wrongdoing, and it\u2019s still an open question just how blame relates\nto activities like holding responsible, demanding answers, punishing,\nand so on. (For some attempted taxonomies, see Macnamara 2011;\nShoemaker 2011; Smith 2012; Tognazzini 2015.) So, answers to the above\nquestions about the ethics of blame will not automatically double as\nanswers to analogous questions about the ethics of these other ways of\ninteracting.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Arpaly, N., 2006, <em>Merit, Meaning, and Human Bondage: An Essay\non Free Will</em>, Princeton: Princeton University Press.", "Arpaly, N. and T.
