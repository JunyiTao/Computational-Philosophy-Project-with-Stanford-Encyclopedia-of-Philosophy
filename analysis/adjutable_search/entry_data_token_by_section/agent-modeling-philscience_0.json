    "main_text": "Origins\n1. Origins\n\nThe method of agent-based modeling was originally developed in the\n1970s and \u201980s with models of social segregation (Schelling\n1971; Sakoda 1971; see also Hegselmann 2017) and cooperation (Axelrod\n& Hamilton 1981) in social sciences, and under the name of\n\u201cindividual-based modeling\u201d in ecology (for an overview\nsee Grimm & Railsback 2005). Following this tradition, ABMs drew\nthe interest of scholars studying social aspects of scientific\ninquiry. By representing scientists as agents equipped with rules for\nreasoning and decision-making, agent-based modeling could be used to\nstudy the social dynamics of scientific research. As a result, ABMs of\nscience have been developed across various disciplines that include\nscience in their subject domain: from sociology of science,\norganizational sciences, cultural evolution theory, the\ninterdisciplinary field of meta-science (or \u201cscience of\nscience\u201d), to social epistemology and philosophy of science.\nWhile ABMs developed in philosophy of science often tackle themes that\nare similar or related to those examined by ABMs of science in other\ndomains, they are motivated by philosophical questions\u2014issues\nembedded in the broader literature in philosophy of science. Their\nintroduction was influenced by several parallel research lines:\nanalytical modeling in philosophy of science, computational modeling\nin related philosophical domains, and agent-based modeling in social\nsciences. In the following, we take a brief look at each of these\nprecursors.\n\nOne of the central ideas behind the development of formal social\nepistemology of science is succinctly expressed by Philip Kitcher in\nhis The Advancement of Science:\n\n\nThe general problem of social epistemology, as I conceive it, is to\nidentify the properties of epistemically well-designed social systems,\nthat is, to specify the conditions under which a group of individuals,\noperating according to various rules for modifying their individual\npractices, succeed, through their interactions, in generating a\nprogressive sequence of consensus practices. (Kitcher 1993: 303) \n\n\nSuch a perspective on social epistemology of science highlighted the\nneed for a better understanding of the relationship between individual\nand group inquiry. Following the tradition of formal modeling in\neconomics, philosophers introduced analytical models to study tensions\ninherent to this relationship, such as the tension between individual\nand group rationality. In this way, they sought to answer the\nquestion: how can individual scientists, who may be driven by\nnon-epistemic incentives, jointly form a community that achieves\nepistemic goals? Most prominently, Goldman and Shaked (1991) developed\na model that examines the relationship between the goal of promoting\none\u2019s professional success and the promotion of\ntruth-acquisition, whereas Kitcher (1990, 1993) proposed a model of\nthe division of cognitive labor, showing that a community consisting\nof scientists driven by non-epistemic interests may achieve an optimal\ndistribution of research efforts. This work was followed by a number\nof other contributions (e.g., Zamora Bonilla 1999; Strevens 2003).\nAnalytic models developed in this tradition endorsed economic\napproaches to the study of science, rooted in the idea of a\n\u201cgenerous invisible hand\u201d, according to which individuals\ninteracting in a given community can bring about consequences that are\nbeneficial for the goals of the community without necessarily aiming\nat those consequences (M\u00e4ki 2005).\n\nAround the same time, computational methods entered the philosophical\nstudy of rational deliberation and cooperation in the context of game\ntheory (Skyrms 1990, 1996; Grim, Mar, & St. Denis 1998), theory\nevaluation in philosophy of science (Thagard 1988) and the study of\nopinion dynamics in social epistemology (Hegselmann & Krause 2002,\n2005; Deffuant, Amblard, Weisbuch, & Faure 2002). Computational\nmodels introduced in this literature included ABMs: for instance, a\ncellular automata model of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, or models\nexamining how opinions change within a group of agents.\n\nAgent-based modeling was first applied to the study of science in\nsociology of science, with the model developed by Nigel Gilbert (1997)\n(cf. Payette 2011). Gilbert\u2019s ABM aimed at reproducing\nregularities that had previously been identified in quantitative\nsociological research on indicators of scientific growth (such as the\ngrowth rate of publications and the distribution of citations per\npaper). The model followed an already established tradition of\nsimulations of artificial societies in social sciences (cf. Epstein\n& Axtell 1996). In contrast to abstract and highly-idealized\nmodels developed in other social sciences (such as economics and\narchaeology), ABMs in sociology of science tended towards an\nintegration of simulations and empirical studies used for their\nvalidation (cf. Gilbert & Troitzsch 2005).\n\nSoon after, ABMs were introduced to the philosophy of science through\npioneering works by Zollman (2007), Weisberg and Muldoon (2009), Grim\n(2009), Douven (2010)\u2014to mention some of the most prominent\nexamples. In contrast to ABMs developed in sociology of science, these\nABMs followed the tradition of abstract and highly-idealized modeling.\nSimilar to analytical models, they were introduced to study how\nvarious properties of individual scientists\u2014such as their\nreasoning, decision-making, actions and relations\u2014bring about\nphenomena characterizing the scientific community\u2014such as a\nsuccess or a failure to acquire knowledge. By representing inquiry in\nan abstract and idealized way, they facilitated insights into the\nrelationship between some aspects of individual inquiry and its impact\non the community while abstracting away from numerous factors that\noccur in actual scientific practice. But in contrast to analytical\nmodels, ABMs proved to be suitable for scenarios often too complex for\nanalytical approaches. These scenarios include heterogeneous\nscientific communities, with individual scientists differing in their\nbeliefs, research heuristics, social networks, goals of inquiry, and\nso forth. Each of these properties can change over time, depending on\nthe agents\u2019 local interactions. In this way ABMs can show how\ncertain features characterizing individual inquiry suffice to generate\npopulation-level phenomena under a variety of initial conditions.\nIndeed, the introduction of ABMs to philosophy of science largely\nfollowed the central idea of generative social science: to explain the\nemergence of a macroscopic regularity we need to show how\ndecentralized local interactions of heterogeneous autonomous agents\ncan generate it. As Joshua Epstein summed it up: \u201cIf you\ndidn\u2019t grow it, you didn\u2019t explain its emergence\u201d\n(2006).\n",
