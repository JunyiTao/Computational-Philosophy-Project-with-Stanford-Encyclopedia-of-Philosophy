    "main_text": "Values and Emotions || Meinong\u2019s Initial Theory \u2014 Value Subjectivism\n7.1 Meinong\u2019s Initial Theory \u2014 Value Subjectivism\n\nMeinong\u2019s early theory of value is influenced by Carl\nMenger\u2019s subjectivist interpretation of value in economics as\nsomething that is not inherent in the goods but determined by\npeople\u2019s subjective valuation. According to Menger (1871, Chapt.\n3, \u00a71), values are not independent real things which exist\noutside the consciousness of men; value is rather the importance\n[Bedeutung] that people attribute to something to the extent\nthat it satisfies their needs. Meinong criticises and modifies,\ngeneralizes and extends that view. He is not only concerned with\neconomic value but with value in general, and he tries to apply\ngeneral value theory to other fields than economics, for instance to\nethics and aesthetics. Already in his early courses on practical\nphilosophy, Meinong bases ethics mainly on general value theory and\nvalue theory on psychology.\n\nMeinong\u2019s early theory of value (1894; 1895) can be dubbed a\nsubjectivist theory insofar as Meinong holds the thesis that\nvalue experiencies are explanatorily prior to values, that is, things\nhave values because of our value attitudes [Werthaltungen],\nand not that we would value things because they have a value per\nse. A value attitude is a value-feeling\n[Wertgef\u00fchl], for instance, the feeling that rescuing\nthis person from a tricky situation is good or meritorious. Value\nattitudes themselves are neither judgements about one\u2019s\nvalue-feelings nor judgements about the values of objects. A\nvalue-feeling is an emotional response to believed states of affairs\nand presupposes, therefore, judgements and representations (ideas) of\nthe intended objects as so-called \u201cpsychological\npresuppositions\u201d (1894, \u00a711). The objects of emotions are\nset up before the mind by those judgements and ideas. Genuine value\nerrors (i.e., false emotional responses to presented objects) are not\npossible. Errors can only occur in those judgements that are\npsychological presuppositions of value attitudes (that the person is\nin a perilous situation if she is not, for instance) and in\nmisjudgements about one\u2019s own (manifest and latent) value\nattitudes (1894: 77\u201381; 1895).\n\nMeinong (1894; 1895) thinks that there are no absolute, impersonal\nvalues, and thus values cannot be defined without the concept of a\nsubject being able to have value-feelings. Values can be seen as a\nspecial relation between the object that has value and\nthe subject for whom the object has value (1894: 71\u20132).\nAlthough Meinong considers himself to be a value subjectivist at this\nstage, he already includes some kind of non-subjective,\nnamely intersubjective and dispositional, conditions in the definition\nof values. Values are conceptually determined by value-feelings, but a\nvalue cannot simply be characterized as an assemblage of\nvalue-feelings. A value judgement [Werturteil], that is,\njudging that something has value or disvalue, goes far beyond the\nactual value feeling, and therefore the decision about its truth value\nis primarily a matter for cognition and not for emotion (1895,\n\u00a74). The verbal expression of a value judgement is neither the\nverbal expression of one\u2019s actual value feeling nor the verbal\njudgement about one\u2019s actual appreciation or aversion. It\nexpresses the judgement that the thing in question has the ability to\ninvoke appreciation or aversion by an adequately oriented subject with\na normal disposition under appropriate circumstances (1894: 25; 1895:\n328).\n\nValues are always personal or interpersonal values, that is, values\nfor an individual or a collective of individuals, respectively. In\ndiscussing moral values, Meinong attaches them not to an individual\nsubject as such but to a collective subject, to the \u201csurrounding\ntotality\u201d [umgebende Gesamtheit] to which the\nindividuals in question belong \u2014 in the end up to the totality\nof mankind \u2014 (1894: 168ff, 205, 216\u20137), or, in a more\npersonified form to the representative of social interests\n(1894: 187). The constitutive nature of values (and value-feelings,\nrespectively) itself is indefinable or unanalyzable insofar as it\ncannot be derived from concepts like utility, happiness, pleasantness,\nbiological needs or cost (1894, \u00a7\u00a72\u20134; 1923, I,\n\u00a7\u00a72\u20135). The value properties of an object are not its\nintrinsic, fundamental properties like common physical or\npsychological properties, they are higher order properties and\nexternal to the object, something dependent upon the underlying\nproperties of the object and the subject.\n\nMeinong, being an ethical relativist and cognitivist, emphasizes that\nthe presence of moral values is an empirical fact (1894: 170), and\nethics, like value theory in general, is an empirical science\n(1894: 225). Against the reproach for having fallen victim to a kind\nof naturalistic fallacy, Meinong could reply, first, the he does not\nconfuse the intellectual, cognitive side with the emotional one, and\nsecond, that some facts are constituted by the intentional (emotional\nand intellectual) attitudes of an individual or the members of a\ncommunity and, because of that, acquire a valuative character and a\nnormative strength.\n\nMeinong bases values on feelings and not on desires, and he critically\ncontrasted his kind of emotivism to Ehrenfels\u2019 voluntarism, a\nmore conative, desire-based theory of values. For Meinong, things have\nvalue because we value things, and we desire things because they have\nvalue for us. (1894: 15, 25; 1895: 341, where he comes closer to\nEhrenfels. Cf. Fabian & Simons 1986: 57\u201375; Schuhmann 2001,\nReicher 2009.)\n",
