    "main_text": "Terminology and Definitions || What is a Genome?\n1.2 What is a Genome?\n\nLooking at the history and the etymology of a term does not, of\ncourse, necessarily tell us a lot about how it is used in the context\nof current science. So what is a genome in today\u2019s life\nsciences? Is it the (haploid) set of chromosomes we find in the\nnucleus of a eukaryotic cell, in line with the original definition by\nWinkler? Or is it the totality of genes we find in an organism or the\ntotality of DNA present in a cell? And if so, which DNA? Most\ndefinitions that are currently in circulation are an intricate mix of\ndifferent ways of approaching the issue. This can be illustrated by\nlooking at the definitions given in several key online resources (for\nmore definitions of the term \u2018genome\u2019 see Table 1 in\nKeller 2011).\n\nThe term is defined on the genome.gov website glossary:\n\n\nThe genome is the entire set of genetic instructions found in a cell.\nIn humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs of chromosomes, found in\nthe nucleus, as well as a small chromosome found in the cells\u2019\nmitochondria. Each set of 23 chromosomes contains approximately 3.1\nbillion bases of DNA sequence. (Talking Glossary: genome, in the\nOther Internet Resources)\n\n\nAnd this is how the U.S. National Library of Medicine defines it:\n\n\nA genome is an organism\u2019s complete set of DNA, including all of\nits genes. Each genome contains all of the information needed to build\nand maintain that organism. In humans, a copy of the entire\ngenome\u2014more than 3 billion DNA base pairs\u2014is contained in\nall cells that have a nucleus. (NIH 2016)\n\n\nSimilarly the education portal of the journal Nature:\n\n\nA genome is the complete set of genetic information in an organism. It\nprovides all of the information the organism requires to function. In\nliving organisms, the genome is stored in long molecules of DNA called\nchromosomes. (Scitable: genome, in the Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nAll of these definitions refer both to information and to instructions\nfor the development and/or functioning of an organism. In the first\ntwo, the genome is also identified with a material entity, in the\nfirst case the chromosomes, in the second a sequence of base pairs.\nNature allows only that the information is \u201cstored\nin\u201d the chromosomes.\n\nThe combination of these two aspects is highly problematic. The\ndefinition from the U.S. National Library of Medicine implies that\n\u201call of the information needed to build and maintain that\norganism\u201d is contained in the\n DNA,[2]\n which is certainly false: many environmental factors, not to mention\nfactors in the maternal cytoplasm, are required for the first task,\nand even more obviously (food, light, etc.) for the second. Moreover\nwhen, as is almost always the case, an organism requires symbiotic\npartners for its proper functioning, such a definition will imply that\nthe DNA of these symbionts is part of the genome of the first\norganism, a result that few would\n welcome.[3]\n The Nature definition commits the same error in its second\nsentence. The genome.gov definition appears to identify the\nchromosomes both with a set of instructions and a material entity,\nwhich appears rather problematically to conflate a material object\nwith an abstract entity. \n\nThe problem is not hard to see. Attempting to combine aspects of the\nmaterial base of the genome and its informational content, as all\nthese definitions do, inevitably assume some simple relation between\nthese two; but in fact the relationship is extremely complex. Because\nthe informational content of the genome is dependent in multiple ways\non elements that are not, on any account, part of the genome, an\naccount in terms purely of informational content seems a hopeless\nproject.\n\nOne commonly held view that can be quickly dismissed, is the idea that\nthe genome is just the sum total of an organism\u2019s genes. The\nproblem here is just that even passing over the well-known problems\nwith saying what a gene is (see Barnes & Dupr\u00e9 2008; SEP\nentry on the\n gene),\n on any tenable account of genes, there is far more to the genome than\ngenes, and only a fraction of the actual DNA contained in the\nchromosomes would be part of the genome, at least in the case of\nhumans and other organisms that have a relatively large amount of\nnon-coding DNA (Barnes & Dupr\u00e9 2008:\n 76).[4]\n Even if \u2018gene\u2019 is interpreted in the widest possible\nsense, including any section of the genome that has some identifiable\nfunction, no one denies that a significant amount of DNA is not\nfunctional. The rest of the DNA would not form part of the genome, an\noutcome that contradicts all definitions of the genome of which we are\naware, and makes nonsense of such familiar concepts as\n\u2018whole-genome sequencing\u2019, which refers to the analysis of\nall the DNA found in the chromosomes.\n\nThere are, we suggest, two initially tenable approaches to the\n problem.[5]\n The first, and one that is often implicitly or explicitly assumed to\nbe correct, is to define the genome as the sequence of nucleotides.\nThis may or may not contain extranuclear DNA, as in mitochondria or\nchloroplasts; the genome.gov definition explicitly includes the\nformer. This last question figured largely in debates over the moral\npermissibility of so-called mitochondrial transplants (a designation\nthat speaks volumes, incidentally, about the almost magical importance\nattached to DNA as opposed to the remaining contents of the cell), but\nit is not one of great philosophical significance. The alternative\napproach is to understand the genome strictly as a material object,\npresumably, in most cases, the nuclear chromosomes. \n\nThe problem with the first approach is that it is largely motivated by\nthe assumption that the nucleotide sequence is what contains all the\nimportant information in the genome. But in fact it has become\nincreasingly clear that this is not the case, especially as a result\nof the growing understanding of epigenetics. Epigenetics is the study\nof material modifications of the genome that affect what parts of the\ngenome sequence are or are not transcribed into RNA, the first stage\nof the process by which the genome influences the containing organism.\nThe two most well-studied classes of epigenetic modification are\nmethylation, the attachment of a methyl group (-CH3) to one\nof the four nucleotides, cytosine, and various chemical modifications\nof the histone proteins, proteins that form the core structure of the\nchromosomes, and around which the DNA double helix is wrapped\n(Bickmore & van Steensel 2013; Cutter & Hayes 2015). The\nnucleotide sequence, then, provides the (extremely large) set of\npossible transcripts that the genome can produce, but the epigenetic\nstate of the genome determines which transcripts are actually produced\n(Jones 2012). Both features of the genome (qua material\nobject) must be specified, therefore, if we want to understand the\nbiologically relevant behavior of the whole system.\n\nSo if the motivation for defining the genome in terms of sequence is\nto capture its informational content, the definition fails to serve\nits goal. Indeed, the definition that will come closest to this goal\nis that which identifies the genome as the material object, the set of\nchromosomes (this interpretation of the genome is defended in detail\nin Barnes & Dupr\u00e9 2008). An implication of this definition\nthat is often taken to be counterintuitive by biologists is that the\ngenome will on this account encompass not only DNA, but the histone\nproteins that are material parts of the chromosomes. But of course the\npoint of the preceding discussion is that the variable chemical states\nof the histones are, in fact, essential bases for some of the\ninformation inherent in the genome.\n\nThe phenomenon of methylation makes a similar point in a slightly\ndifferent way. The nucleotides that comprise the familiar sequence are\ncytosine, thymine, adenine and guanine). When a methyl group attaches\nto the cytosine molecule the resultant nucleotide is not, strictly\nspeaking, cytosine, but 5-methyl cytosine. So unless one takes the\nletter \u2018C\u2019 in the standard representation of sequence to\nmean, rather counterintuitively, \u201ccytosine or 5-methyl\ncytosine\u201d, it is only a partially accurate representation of the\nfeature of the genome it purports to represent. More importantly, it\nis a representation that fails to capture crucial functional aspects\nof the genome.\n\nA final telling point is that it has recently become clear that there\nare functions of the genome, as material object, that go well beyond\neven the broadest interpretation of the genetic (Bustin & Misteli\n2016). It appears that the genome plays an essential role in a range\nof cellular processes. First, its physical arrangement into domains of\nvarying sizes plays a central role in the coordination of gene\nexpression. But much further from the genetic, it is a large object\nthe mechanical forces of which are involved in various cellular\nprocesses and cellular homeostasis, and the chromatin fiber provides a\nscaffolding for both proteins and membranes (Bustin & Misteli\n2016). Unless we are to introduce a new word to refer to this\nbiologically vital entity, only a material conception of the genome\ncan capture the full range of its activities.\n\nOne might be tempted to object to the argument above concerning\nmethylation, that whereas methylation is a somewhat transitory state,\nthe underlying four-letter sequence is extremely durable, lasting\nacross many generations. Richard Dawkins (1976) famously emphasized\nthe importance of this durability in arguing for the importance of\nthis stability in evolution, even going so far as to describe genes as\n\u201cimmortal\u201d. So perhaps there is a good reason for\nunderstanding \u201cC\u201d as referring to a disjunction.\n\nThis is not the place to address the quasi-theological view of gene\nimmortality. However, this does point to a fundamental issue about the\nnature of genes. Even if genes, somehow, were unchanging immortal\nsubstances, the genome is nothing of the sort. It is an extremely\ndynamic entity, constantly changing its properties in generally\nadaptive response to it environment. Moreover even the constancy of\nits nucleotide sequence is something maintained only by the continuous\napplication of various editing and repair mechanisms. Indeed, far from\nbeing an eternal substance, we suggest it is much better seen as a\nprocess, a highly complex set of dynamic activities crucial in\nmaintaining the structural and functional stability not only of the\norganism but also, through its role in reproduction, of the lineage.\nImportantly, these relations are bi-directional and, specifically, the\norganism is also crucial to maintaining the necessary aspects of\nstability of the\n genome.[6]\n",
