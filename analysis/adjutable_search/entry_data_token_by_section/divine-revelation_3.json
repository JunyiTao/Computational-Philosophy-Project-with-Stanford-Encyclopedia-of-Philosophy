We have already seen that\npropositional (or non-manifestational) revelation can be subdivided\ninto \u201cthe causation model\u201d and \u201cthe communication\nmodel\u201d. Beyond this, the theologian Avery Dulles has suggested a\ntypology useful for categorizing theories of manifestational\nrevelation. He divides contemporary theological accounts of revelation\ninto five major classes depending on \u201ctheir central vision of\nhow and where revelation occurs\u201d (Dulles 1992: 27). Besides\npropositional revelation (which he calls \u201cRevelation as\nDoctrine\u201d), Dulles discerns four basic models for\nmanifestational revelation.\n\nRevelation as History. This model identifies revelation with\nGod\u2019s \u201cgreat deeds\u201d in salvation history. The Bible\nis seen as the record of these deeds, for example the Exodus or the\nresurrection of Jesus. The biblical text itself, however, is not part\nof revelation. Some representatives of this approach hold that\nrevelation must include a supernatural cognitive assistance\n(illumination) so that the historical events can be interpreted\ncorrectly (Baillie 1956: 65). Others deny that this is necessary\n(Pannenberg 1968). \n\nRevelation as Inner Experience. According to this model,\nrevelation consists in some kind of \u201cprivileged interior\nexperience of grace or communion with God\u201d (Dulles 1992: 27).\nSome proponents claim that the interior experience is\n\u201cpre-conceptual\u201d and occurs at a depth-level of\nconsciousness that transcends and embraces our ordinary experience of\nthe world (Schleiermacher 1799 [1996: 25\u201326]; 1830 [1999:\n16\u201317]; Rahner 1978: Ch. V). Others take the relevant\nexperiences to be conceptually structured and more like perceptual\nexperiences (Alston 1991; Pike 1992). The pre-conceptual view\nencounters epistemological puzzles about how non-conceptual inner\noccurrences can justify beliefs about God, or how the experiences can\nbe about God in the first place (Proudfoot 1985).\n\nRevelation as Dialectical Presence. This model intends to\ncapture the thought of Karl Barth\u2014who is one of the most\ninfluential figures of revelation-theology in the twentieth\ncentury\u2014and his followers in the school of \u201cdialectical\ntheology\u201d. For Barth, revelation is a\n\u201cnon-objectifiable\u201d encounter with God himself in Christ,\nan event that is mediated by the Bible and the church\u2019s\nproclamation about Christ. The Bible itself, however, is not\nrevelation but merely the channel through which revelation\n\u201cflows\u201d whenever God wills this to happen. Moreover, since\nGod is \u201cWholly Other\u201d and as such unknowable for humans,\nrevelation must be described in terms of a paradoxical dialectic of\nsimultaneous \u201cunveiling\u201d and \u201cveiling\u201d.\n\u201cRevelation\u201d, says Barth, \u201cmeans the self-unveiling,\nimparted to men, of the God who by nature cannot be unveiled to\nmen\u201d (Barth 1975: 320; see also Hart 2000). It is unclear\nwhether this model manages to present a coherent account of divine\nrevelation (for a sympathetic discussion, see McCormack 2008:\n28\u201335). The intention behind the model, however, is to reconcile\nthe claim that revelation provides real, objective knowledge of God\nwith the claim that God radically transcends all human categories and\nall created media of revelation.\n\nRevelation as New Awareness. According to this model,\nrevelation means a transformation of human subjectivity, a\n\u201cfulfillment of the inner drive of the human spirit toward\nfuller consciousness\u201d. Revelation does not disclose God as an\n\u201cobject\u201d, even though God might be \u201cmysteriously\npresent as the transcendent dimension of human engagement in creative\ntasks\u201d. In essence, revelation is more about seeing the self and\nthe world in a new light than about knowledge of God (Dulles 1992: 98,\n99, 28).\n\nDulles\u2019s models are theoretical constructions or\n\u201cideal-types\u201d, and elements from different models can be\ncombined. For example, theologians like Paul Tillich and Karl Rahner\ncombine the \u201cnew awareness\u201d model with experiential and\nhistorical elements (Tillich 1951: 111\u2013118, 120\u2013122;\nRahner 1966). It has been argued, however, that none of the\nmanifestational models presented above can provide\u2014either\nseparately or in combination\u2014a reasonable account of how\nknowledge of God\u2019s \u201ctheistic properties\u201d\n(omnipotence, omniscience and infinite goodness) comes about. Such an\naccount requires appeal to propositional revelation at some point, or\nat least to traditional natural theology (Wahlberg 2014: Ch. 3).\n2.The Justification of Revelatory Claims\n\nA revelatory claim is a claim to the effect that a certain divine\nrevelation (propositional or manifestational) has taken\nplace\u2014that God has revealed x to P (Menssen &\nSullivan 2007: 69). The existence of revelatory claims in different\nreligions raises the question of epistemic justification: Could such\nclaims be justified, and in that case, how? \u201cBeing\njustified\u201d will here be understood in the very general sense of\nhaving \u201cpositive epistemic status\u201d (the status of being\n\u201cright, or proper, or acceptable, or approvable or up to\nstandard\u201d (Plantinga 1988: 1). \n\nIn the contemporary debate, there are both non-inferential and\ninferential (evidentialist) models of justification for revelatory\nclaims. In addition, there are positions that some might characterize\nas fideistic, but that are perhaps better described as portraying the\njustification of revelation as \u201ctotally sui\ngeneris\u201d. Below non-inferential, inferential and \u201csui\ngeneris\u201d positions will be treated in turn. However, since the\ncontemporary debates about justification draw inspiration from a long\ntradition of reflection within theology, it will be useful first to\nconsider some historical background.\n2.1 Traditional Views\n\nIn historical Christian thought, the concepts of (special) revelation\nand faith go together. Faith is the believing response to the\ndivine revelation (Dulles 1992: 4). There has been a broad consensus\nthat the act of faith requires grace in the sense of an internal,\ndivine influence or assistance. However, classical Christian thinkers\nalso agree that the act of faith is reasonable, and that Christian\nbelief is epistemically justified to an eminent degree (Lamont 2004:\n46). In modern parlance, \u201cfaith\u201d is often understood as\nsynonymous with \u201cunsupported belief\u201d, but this\nunderstanding is alien to the historical tradition, for which faith\nconstitutes a form of knowledge. It is traditionally agreed, moreover,\nthat faith has this rational status because it is based on the\nauthority of God\u2019s own testimony. In much pre-modern theology it\nis unclear, however, exactly how God\u2019s testimony or speech is\nidentified as such, and what warrants this identification. \n\nImportant church fathers such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen,\nChrysostom and Augustine all held that there are good arguments from\npublicly accessible evidence for the veridicality of the Christian\nrevelation\u2014arguments that establish the claim that God has\nspoken beyond reasonable doubt. Patristic arguments typically appeal\nto fulfilled prophecies, miracles, \n\n\nthe extension and holiness of the Church, the transformative power of\nthe Christian message and the independently establishable goodness and\ntruth of Christian teaching. (Lamont 2004: 46, 38) \n\n\nHowever, the major church fathers did not seem to view these\napologetic arguments as necessary for proper faith, or as the\nepistemic basis for faith. Instead, the divine revelation\nitself\u2014the word of God\u2014is often portrayed as having the\npower to non-inferentially justify Christian beliefs. As Clement of\nAlexandria writes, \n\n\nHe who has believed in the divine Scriptures, with a firm judgement,\nreceives as an irrefutable demonstration the voice of God who gave us\nthose Scriptures. So faith is no longer something that is confirmed by\ndemonstration. (Stromate II, 2, 9, quoted in Lamont 2004: 32)\n\n\n\nAugustine, likewise, emphasized that Christian belief is produced by\nGod working internally in the believer through grace.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas affirms both the supernatural,\ngrace-induced character of Christian belief and its rational warrant.\nSince Aquinas is a common reference point in contemporary discussions\nabout faith and revelation, it will be helpful to consider his thought\nin a bit more detail. (For a comparison between Aquinas\u2019s\nthought on revelation with Jewish and Islamic medieval perspectives,\nsee Dobie 2019.) Aquinas believes that the Christian revelatory claim\ncan be justified, at least to a significant degree, by inferential\narguments (see, e.g., Summa Contra Gentiles I, Ch. 6).\nSometimes he seems to suggest that arguments are necessary for\nrational assent to revelation (Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 2,\na. 9, ad. 3). At other times, however, it appears that faith is\njustified without arguments (ST II-II, q. 27, a. 3, ad. 2.\nSee also Niederbacher 2012: 342\u2013343). Due to this tension, there\nare different interpretations of Aquinas. John Jenkins has helpfully\ndistinguished between the Naturalist Interpretation, the\nVoluntarist Interpretation, and the Supernatural\nExternalist Interpretation (Jenkins 1997: Ch. 6). These\ninterpretations emphasize different elements of Aquinas\u2019s\nthought that are also found in traditional theology in general. As we\nwill see in the following sections, similar elements recur in\ncontemporary theories. \n\nAccording to the Naturalist Interpretation, at least some\npersons assent to the articles of the Creed because, first, they\naccept a cluster of arguments from natural theology, second, they\nbelieve on the basis of human testimony and other evidence that\nmiracles and other signs have occurred in biblical history and in the\nhistory of the church. From these considerations they conclude that\nGod has made a revelation in history, which is contained, in its\nessence, in the Creed. The Christian revelatory claim is justified on\nthis inferential basis. Grace and God\u2019s supernatural influence\nhas little epistemic significance in this process\u2014grace just\nmakes the believer accept God\u2019s revelation without\nreluctance (Penelhum 1977: 146; see also Hick 1988:\n11\u201331).\n\nThe Voluntarist Interpretation, on the other hand, claims\nthat a consideration of the evidence is insufficient to elicit firm\nassent to revelation. What brings this forth, instead, is something\nlike \u201cwishful thinking\u201d or utilitarian considerations.\nAquinas says: \n\n\nWe are moved to believe the words of God insofar as the reward of\neternal life is promised to us if we have believed; and this moves the\nwill to assent. (De Veritate, q. 14, a. 1, quoted in Jenkins\n1997: 176) \n\n\nAn act of the will compensates for the \u201cgap in the\nevidence\u201d. However, since the activity of the will\u2014when it\ncomes to belief in God\u2014is part of a reliable belief-forming\nprocess put in place by grace, the beliefs that it produces are\nwarranted. Aquinas, hence, was an epistemological reliabilist of\nsorts, according to this view (Ross 1985; Stump 1991).\n\nThe Supernatural Externalist Interpretation gives arguments\nfrom public evidence a role in preparing a person for the assent of\nfaith. However, the actual assent is the product of a supernaturally\ninfused cognitive habit. The supernatural \u201clight of faith\u201d\nmakes it possible for a person immediately and non-inferentially to\ngrasp the articles of the Creed as divinely revealed. Belief\nin the revelatory claim is hence a basic belief, and it is\njustified \n\n\nbecause it was arrived at by the proper operation of a cognitive\nprocess which, though infused and not [natural], was nevertheless\ndesigned to attain the truth in this sphere. (Jenkins 1997:\n190\u2013191)\n\n\nMost contemporary Aquinas scholars now reject the Naturalist\nInterpretation, which cannot do justice to the textual evidence.\nHence, even though Aquinas indeed presents a collection of credibility\narguments, he seems to have held that belief in divine revelation can\nbe\u2014and usually is\u2014justified in some other, non-inferential\nway. It is therefore unfortunate that the view represented by the\nNaturalist Interpretation is sometimes taken to be \u201cthe\ntraditional view\u201d of how revelatory claims are justified\n(Penelhum 1997: 67\u201386). \n\nAlthough Aquinas might not be a good fit for \u201cthe traditional\nview\u201d, some later thinkers are. Starting with Duns Scotus, the\nrole of inferential arguments in the rational acceptance of revelation\nwas gradually expanded and made more precise in mainstream Christian\nthought. From the seventeenth century to the mid-twentieth century,\nmost Catholic theologians saw \u201ccredibility arguments\u201d as\nnecessary for faith and as capable of establishing beyond reasonable\ndoubt that God has revealed the Christian religion (Lamont 2004:\n87\u201388). The act of faith was reduced to the drawing of the\nnecessary inference from this insight to the conclusion that Christian\nbeliefs are true. On the Protestant side, this development continued\nand culminated in thinkers such as William Chillingworth, John\nTillotson and John Locke, whose views\u2014ironically\u2014are the\nclosest matches to what Penelhum describes as the \u201ctraditional\nview\u201d. As we have seen, however, the church fathers and Thomas\nAquinas held more complex views in which elements of both inferential\nand non-inferential justification are found, and where supernatural\ngrace and the will play important epistemic roles. Below we will\nencounter again these elements in the accounts of contemporary\nphilosophers and theologians. \n2.2 Non-Inferential Justification\n\nA claim is non-inferentially justified when its positive epistemic\nstatus is a result of some form of direct cognition, as opposed to\nbeing achieved through a process of inference from evidence. The\nnotion of \u201cdirect cognition\u201d includes having a belief that\nis \u201cproperly basic\u201d, but also having a belief that\ndirectly represents the content of a perceptual experience (assuming\nthat experiences have conceptual content). \n\nThere are non-inferential views concerning both the justification of\n\u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d revelation. In this\nsection, three varieties of non-inferential justification will be\naddressed: Perceptual models, Plantinga\u2019s A/C-model, and\ntestimonial models.\n2.2.1 Perceptual Models\n\nSome philosophers have suggested a perceptual interpretation of\nnatural revelation, according to which \u201cintentional\ndesign\u201d is a property that can be directly perceived in nature\nas well as in human behavior and art. Since intentional design by\ndefinition entails a designer, this means that our experiences of\nnature could give us immediate knowledge of the existence of a creator\n(Ratzsch 2003; Wahlberg 2012; Plantinga 2011: Ch. 8). For related\nviews, see Mullen 2004 and Evans 2010).\n\nThe putative plausibility of this hypothesis depends on the\nphenomenological observation that the appearance of design in\nnature is something that forcefully strikes most people, even\natheists. As Hume lets Cleanthes say: \n\n\nConsider, anatomize the eye \u2026 and tell me, from your own\nfeeling, if the idea of a contriver does not immediately flow in\nupon you with a force like that of a sensation?. (Dialogues\nConcerning Natural Religion, Part III, (p. 65)) \n\n\nPsychological research, moreover, indicates that teleological beliefs\nabout nature come natural to humans. Some even argue that humans are\n\u201cintuitive theists\u201d (Kelemen 2004; Barrett 2012). A\nrelated consideration in favor of design-perception is that it could\npotentially explain why beliefs about design in nature are so\nwidespread and often held so persistently, even though they have\nturned out to be hard to justify by argument (Ratzsch 2003:\n135\u2013136).\n\nA standard move by those who claim that belief in revelation is\nnon-inferentially justified, is to appeal to the\n\u201cparity-argument\u201d (first found in Thomas Reid\n[1710\u20131796], see Wolterstorff 2001: 197\u2013206; see also\nPlantinga 1990: 271; Alston 1983). Adapted to the present context, the\nargument runs something like this: Since beliefs about intentional\ndesign in nature arise in a similar way as (ordinary) perceptual\nbeliefs and memory beliefs, there is no reason to discriminate among\nthese classes of beliefs with respect to their prima facie\nepistemic status. Hence, if we regard perceptual and memory beliefs as\nprima facie justified without argument, we should regard\ndesign-beliefs in the same way. \n\nIt could be objected that in order to have beliefs about design, a\nrather complex conceptual background is necessary. Design beliefs,\ntherefore, cannot be understood as perceptual. However, the necessity\nof a conceptual background for having a certain kind of perceptual\nbeliefs does not necessarily entail that those beliefs are\ninferentially derived from the background (McDowell 2004: 296;\nWahlberg 2012: 128\u2013130. See also McGrath 2008: Ch. 5). Even the\nmost primitive perceptual beliefs (\u201cred here now\u201d)\npresuppose a network of concepts.\n\nIs evolution a defeater for the idea of design-perception? (De Cruz\nand De Smedt 2014: 195). Perhaps not. The hypothesis that God creates\nindirectly, through the evolutionary process, entails that God exerts\na certain control over the outcomes of that process. This means that\nGod has intended at least certain features of the outcome, and these\nfeatures would hence count as divinely designed. Since divine design\nin this sense seems to be compatible with evolution, design-perception\nmight be as well (Wahlberg 2012: 172\u2013190; Kojonen 2018). \n\nAnother objection proceeds from the claim that design-beliefs about\nnature are generated by mechanisms that are too unreliable to confer\npositive epistemic status. One version of this argument contends that\nthe \u201chyperactiveness\u201d of our HADD (\u201cHyper-Active\nAgency Detection Device\u201d)\u2014which is an evolutionary\nadaptation for detecting possibly dangerous agency in the natural\nenvironment\u2014means that it produces too many false positives to\nbe trusted when it \u201cdetects\u201d design in natural structures.\nThe debate about this is ongoing (Barrett 2004: 31; Visala 2011: Ch.\n5; De Smedt and De Cruz 2020).\n\nIn the realm of special revelation, there are also theories\nof direct, perceptual justification. William Alston has argued for the\npossibility that God could be (nonsensorially) perceived, and that\nsuch \u201cmystical perception\u201d can justify beliefs about God\n(Alston 1991). Different religions have different, socially\nestablished \u201cdoxastic practices\u201d (belief-forming habits)\nbuilt on purported experiences of God. Appealing to the parity\nargument, Alston contends that such mystical practices can be on more\nor less equal footing, epistemically, with basic doxastic practices\nsuch as sense-perceptual and memory-based belief-forming. In general,\nbasic doxastic practices cannot be shown to be reliable without\ncircularity, but if they are socially established and their outputs\nare reasonably internally consistent and consistent with the outputs\nof other practices, they can be rationally engaged in. The case for\nthe rationality of a doxastic practice is also strengthened if it\ngenerates significant \u201cself-support\u201d\u2014for example by\nmaking predictions that are later confirmed.\n\nBeliefs generated by rational doxastic practices can, however, be\ndefeated by \u201cover-rider\u201d-systems internal to the practices\nthemselves. In the case of \u201cmystical perception\u201d, the\noverrider-system includes a religion\u2019s doctrinal teaching, by\nwhich the veridicality of purported mystical perceptions is tested.\nAlston argues that the \u201cChristian mystical practice\u201d,\nwhich generates significant self-support by the way it can\n\u201cpredict\u201d or guide spiritual development, can be\nrationally engaged in, and hence produce beliefs about God that are\nprima facie justified. While mystical perceptions of the kind\nAlston deals with are often regarded as rare, Michael Rea has argued\nthat experiences of God\u2019s presence and of communication from God\nmight be \u201cwidely available\u201d (Rea 2018: Ch. 6\u20137). He\nsuggests that the ability to experience God can be improved through\nspiritual practices and disciplines\u2014an idea that is common in\nmystical traditions (see also Wynn 2013: 73\u201374).\n\nThe main problem for the idea of direct perceptual encounters with God\nis the fact of religious diversity and the seeming incompatibility\nbetween the outputs of rival mystical practices. One approach to this\nproblem is to view the incompatibility as merely apparent. Building on\nKant\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena, Hick argues\nthat God or ultimate reality is unknowable in itself, and that the\ndifferent descriptions of this reality produced by different religions\nonly apply within the realm of human experience (1989: Ch. 14. For\ncritique of the Kantian picture, see Plantinga 2000b: Ch. 1\u20132;\nMenssen and Sullivan 2007: 22\u201330; Macdonald 2009b: Ch. 2).\nNevertheless, those descriptions allow people to respond to and\ninteract with the Real in ways that are conducive to salvation.\n\nHick\u2019s solution to the problem of religious diversity is bought\nat the price of denying the incompatibility that religious believers\nthemselves see between their religious beliefs and those of other\nreligions. Finding this price too high, Alston takes the disagreements\nbetween religions to be real, and argues that there could be realms of\nreality \n\n\nthat are so difficult for us to discern that widespread agreement is\nextremely difficult or impossible to attain, even if some\nveridical cognition of that realm is achieved. (Alston 1991: 267)\n\n\nA position that lies between Hick\u2019s non-cognitivist pluralism\nand Alston\u2019s cognitivist exclusivism is Keith Ward\u2019s\n\u201copen theology\u201d that is attentive to the possibility of\nrevelation in all religions. This possibility entails, for Ward, that\nbelievers must be prepared to critically question their own tradition\nin light of insights from other religions (Ward 1994: 339\u2013340).\nAnother option is Griffiths\u2019 \u201copen inclusivism\u201d,\nbased on the claim that \u201cit is possible that alien religions\nteach truths of religious significance to the Church\u201d (2001:\n63).\n\nBesides experiences that have God as their putative object, other\nkinds of religious experiences could be revelatory as well. Mark Wynn\nhas drawn attention to the \u201cmaterially mediated or sacramental\ncharacter of much religious experience\u201d and suggested that the\nexperiential impact of certain \u201cmaterial contexts\u201d (such\nas special places with an existentially charged history) could mediate\nan awareness of God (Wynn 2009: 147; see also Wynn 2013: Ch. 3). \n2.2.2 The A/C-Model\n\nNon-inferential justification of revelatory claims need not be\nconstrued as perceptual. Alvin Plantinga, while sympathetic to\nperceptual theories of natural revelation (2000b: 286\u2013289; 2011:\nCh. 8), has proposed a broader account involving both general and\nspecial revelation. He suggests that humans have a natural cognitive\nfaculty which \u201cin a wide variety of circumstances produces in us\nbeliefs about God\u201d. Those beliefs are \u201coccasioned\u201d\nby the circumstances\u2014for example by the sight of a mighty\nscenery or a beautiful sunset\u2014but they are not conclusions from\nthem, not even \u201cquick and sotto voce inferences\u201d.\nHowever, the theistic beliefs thus caused could have positive\nepistemic status if the cognitive faculty that produces them is\n\u201cfunctioning properly in a congenial epistemic environment\naccording to a design plan successfully aimed at truth\u201d\n(Plantinga 2000: 172, 175, 178). Beliefs generated by such a\nfaculty\u2014which Plantinga, following Calvin, calls a\n\u201csensus divinitatis\u201d\u2014would be\n\u201cproperly basic\u201d in the sense that they are\nnon-inferentially warranted as long as they are undefeated. \n\nPlantinga\u2019s model for the justification of natural revelation is\nexternalist, and he does not claim to be able to demonstrate that it\nis true. His agenda, instead, is to defend theistic belief from the\n\u201cde jure objection\u201d, which attacks the rational\nstatus of theism while leaving open the question of its truth.\nPlantinga claims that this attack fails. If theism is true, it is very\nlikely that there is a sensus divinitatis, and in that case,\nbelief in God would be warranted.\n\nPlantinga\u2019s model also includes the justification of special\nrevelation. In what he calls the \u201cExtended A/C-model\u201d\n(after Aquinas and Calvin), Plantinga posits, besides the natural\nsensus divinitatis, a supernatural belief-forming mechanism\nconsisting mainly in the \u201cinternal instigation of the Holy\nSpirit\u201d. This mechanism is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation\nthat also includes the divine teaching of the Scriptures, and the\ndivine repair of the cognitive and affective damage caused by sin.\nWhen confronted with the teachings of Scripture, the Holy Spirit can\ninstigate people to accept them as true by creating faith. Plantinga\nsees the beliefs accepted in this way as \u201crevealed to our\nminds\u201d (Plantinga 2000: 241). Even though this process is not an\nin-built part of human nature, it is (ex hypothesi) \u201ca\nreliable belief-producing process\u201d, and its deliverances will\ntherefore be warranted and qualify as knowledge (Plantinga 2000: 257,\n206).\n\nThe debate about Plantinga\u2019s proposals is extensive, and\ncritique comes from both theological and philosophical quarters (Baker\n2005). Some criticize Plantinga\u2019s model for being\nphenomenologically inadequate: Many believers seem to be looking for\ngrounds for their faith and feel the need for partial support from\nother beliefs (Beilby 2005: 195\u2013197). Other critics attack the\nvery idea that religious beliefs can be properly basic, which\nPlantinga defends by means of a version of the parity-argument (see\n section 2.2.1).\n Grigg, for example, argues that a major difference between religious\nbeliefs and ordinary perceptual beliefs is that people may have a bias\nin favor of religious beliefs, since there is a psychological benefit\nto be gained from believing that God exists (Grigg 1983: 126). In\nresponse, it has been argued that the same is true of some perceptual\nbeliefs (e.g., seeing high numbers in one\u2019s bank account)\n(McLeod 1987: 5). \n\nA related critique is that more or less absurd belief-systems could\nclaim to be based on properly basic beliefs. This is often referred to\nas the \u201cGreat Pumpkin Objection\u201d (see DeRose 1999 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Michael Martin, developing a version of it, claims that \n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s proposal would generate many different communities\nthat could legitimately claim that their basic beliefs are rational,\n\n\n\nsuch as voodoo or astrological communities (Martin 1990: 272). In\nresponse, Plantinga can point out that basic beliefs are defeasible,\nand that the basic beliefs of what we take to be obviously irrational\nbelief systems might be easily defeated (Baker 2007: 88\u201389).\n\nClosely related to the Great Pumpkin Objection is the objection from\nreligious diversity, perhaps the greatest challenge for\nPlantinga\u2019s as well as for Alston\u2019s theories. Why could\nnot proponents of other religions copy Plantinga\u2019s\nepistemological moves and adapt them to their own religions? (Hill\n2001). Helm, accordingly, suggests that Plantinga\u2019s argument\n\u201cleaves his defense of the rationality of Christian theism not\nso much open to refutation as to imitation\u201d (Helm 2001: 1112).\nIn response, it could be argued that if a religion is false, defeaters\nwill probably arise.\n\nAnother type of objections focus on the epistemic consequences of\nreligious disagreement. Some critics argue that if other religions\n\u201ccan make as good a case of being knowledge-if-true as\nChristianity\u201d, it is hard to see why people should remain\nChristians in the absence of some religiously neutral grounds (Forrest\n2002: 111.) Basinger suggests that religious believers who want to\nmaximize truth and avoid error are \u201cunder a prima facie\nobligation to attempt to resolve significant epistemic peer\nconflict\u201d (Basinger 2002: 11). However, it might not always be\neasy to determine when people are true \u201cepistemic peers\u201d,\nand the crucial question is what happens if the disagreement, despite\nefforts of resolution, remains (Plantinga 1997). Should disagreement\nbe taken as a defeater of belief? Plantinga has claimed that this idea\nis a \u201cphilosophical tar baby\u201d, since it would mean the\ndefeat of the religious pluralist position as certainly as that of his\nown (2000a: 177; see also Alston 1988). Still, it could be argued that\nwhile disagreement is not a defeater of belief, it should lead people\nto believe with less confidence. \n\nA different kind of charge against Plantinga\u2019s model is that it\nleaves unaddressed the question of actual warrant (Baker 2007:\n87\u201389). \n\n\nThere is \u2026 a monumental issue which Plantinga does not discuss,\nand which a lot of people will consider needs discussing. This is\nwhether Christian beliefs do have warrant \u2026 He has shown that\nthey do, if they are true; so we might hope for discussion of whether\nthey are true. (Swinburne 2001: 206) \n\n\nMaybe the sense of dissatisfaction expressed by Swinburne can be\nsomewhat mitigated by attending to the distinction between\n\u201cbeing rational in holding a theistic belief\u201d and\n\u201cshowing that theistic belief is rational\u201d\n(Sudduth 2003: 311).\n2.2.3 Testimonial Models\n\nThe idea of divine testimony is at the core of traditional\nconceptions of revelation in both Jewish-Christian and Islamic thought\n(for the latter, see Adeel 2019: 30\u201335). However, testimony and\nthe justification of testimonial beliefs can be understood in\ndifferent ways. Within contemporary philosophy of testimony, there are\ntwo basic schools. Reductionists hold that beliefs acquired\nthrough testimony must be justified by an (implicit or explicit)\nargument from evidence that establishes the trustworthiness of the\nwitness. Anti-reductionists deny this and regard testimony as\na basic, sui generis source of epistemic justification, like\nperception and memory. Hence, for anti-reductionists, testimonial\nbeliefs are non-inferentially justified. This view has interesting\nimplications for the issue of belief in divine revelation.\n\nInspired by Aquinas as well as by contemporary anti-reductionism\n(especially John McDowell), Lamont argues that the ability to gain\nknowledge from truthful testimony is an intellectual virtue, together\nwith perception and memory (Lamont 2004: Ch. 5). When a hearer\nH believes a speaker S testifying that p, the\nvery fact that S knows p and sincerely testifies to\np gives H knowledge of p, which entails that\nH has a knowledge-constituting justification for p. This\njustification is not reducible to H\u2019s evidence for the\ntrustworthiness of S.\n\nLamont argues, on theological grounds, that God speaks through the\nChurch, and that the Bible is part of this divine speech (Lamont 2004:\nCh. 7). When a person believes a biblical statement because it is\nspoken by God, what the person acquires is testimonial knowledge. This\nknowledge is justified and counts as knowledge by the very fact that\nit comes from God\u2019s own testimony. However, a condition for\nbelieving a biblical statement because it is spoken by God,\nis that the hearer is able to recognize it as God\u2019s\nspeech. This recognition happens, according to Lamont, through the\neffects that the divine message has on the hearer. Following John\nOwen, Lamont appeals to the moral enlightenment and transformation of\nthe hearer that result when the divine message is heard. These\neffects, argues Lamont, can only happen through divine power, and they\nare therefore clear signs that allow the hearer to recognize the\ndivine identity of the speaker (Lamont 2004: 198\u2013206).\nThe hearer, hence, can believe God, and so acquire the\nsatisfactory epistemic standing that God\u2019s testimony\nprovides.\n\nIt can be questioned whether there are moral transformations that\nprove the involvement of a divine power (King 2008: 74).\nHowever, supposing that the divine origin of the Christian message\ncould really be established in this way, it seems to follow that\nLamont\u2019s anti-reductionist account of testimony has no important\nepistemic role to play in his analysis of revealed knowledge. If we\ncan infer, from certain effects of the message, that it is God who has\nspoken, then we can also infer that the message is true (since God\nwould not lie or be mistaken). This seems to make appeal to testimony\nas a basic source of knowledge/justification superfluous.\n\n\nWahlberg (2014) has attempted to formulate a consistently\nanti-reductionist theory of knowledge by divine testimony. He suggests\nthat one can identify divine speech by relying on God\u2019s own\nsay-so. An example would be if a person believes Jesus when Jesus\nclaims to speak for God (supposing that his claim is true). In such a\nscenario, one would acquire testimonial knowledge from God\u2019s\ntestimony (through Jesus) without (initially) knowing that it is God\nwho speaks (Wahlberg 2014: Ch. 6; see also Lamont 1996).\n\nHowever, wouldn\u2019t it be irrational just to believe a guy who\nclaims to speak for God? Wahlberg acknowledges that normally, it\nwould. He argues that in order for a Hearer H to be able to\nabsorb trustworthy testimony from a speaker S in such as way\nthat knowledge ensues, H must exercise doxastic\nresponsibility. This means that she must be sensitive to and on\nthe lookout for evidence and considerations that speak\nagainst the trustworthiness of S. If H fails to\ndisplay such sensitivity, she cannot acquire knowledge from\nanyone\u2019s testimony, even if it happens to be true. Now, doxastic\nresponsibility clearly demands that testimony that purports to come\nfrom God be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism. In order for\na responsible hearer to be able to absorb such testimony in a way that\nyields knowledge (supposing that the testimony really transmits\nrevelation), there must be some circumstance that defeats the natural\nreasons for mistrust (such as the possibility that a putative prophet\nlies or is deluded).\n\nWahlberg claims that a miracle can constitute such a circumstance. If\nJesus in fact rose from the dead, his closest disciples who saw his\npost-mortem appearances would have been in a position to believe\n(without doxastic irresponsibility) Jesus\u2019 claim to speak for\nGod. This means that they could have known the truth of a revelatory\nclaim on the basis of God\u2019s own testimony.\n\nBut what about those people who do not witness a miracle? Wahlberg\nargues that knowledge of Jesus\u2019 resurrection could be available,\nthrough the biblical testimony, to non-witnesses, for example to\npeople who live today. The biblical testimony about the resurrection,\nin turn, can be believed without doxastic irresponsibility by people\nwho live today due to the historical-critical evidence that supports\nit and defeats the natural reasons for skepticism. According to\nWahlberg, knowledge of the resurrection gained in this way would be\nnon-inferentially justified by testimony (as a basic or sui\ngeneris source of justification), rather than by inference from\nthe available historical-critical evidence. The latter evidence is not\ngood enough for knowledge, but only for enabling responsible belief.\n\n\nWahlberg\u2019s case for doxastic responsibility depends on a\ncontroversial assessment of the strength of the historical-critical\ncase for Jesus\u2019 resurrection. Another potential problem is the\nfact that most Christians do not know the historical-critical evidence\nfor the resurrection. Does it follow that most Christians do not\nbelieve in divine revelation responsibly? (Griffiths 2018). To address\nthis difficulty, Wahlberg appeals to the social nature of knowledge,\nand argues that individuals can satisfy the requirements of doxastic\nresponsibility in virtue of the epistemic competence inherent in the\ncommunities they belong to.\n2.3 Inferential Justification\n\nThis section will continue, for a while, with the theme of divine\ntestimony, but now from a reductionist perspective. The accounts\nstudied so far work with an anti-reductionist (non-inferential) view\nof testimonial justification. However, it can be argued that when it\ncomes to believing purportedly divine testimony, the stakes are too\nhigh for it to be rational to trust without positive evidence of\ntrustworthiness (King 2008: 78).\n\nAccording to King, rational belief in divine self-testimony requires\nthat God gives us \u201csufficient evidence to trust in him\u201d\n(King 2008: 176). We can know by a priori reasoning what kind\nof evidence God must provide in order to win our trust, and so we can\nanticipate that God (if he exists) will provide this kind of evidence.\nImportantly, a divine revelation must be \u201cdiscrete\u201d and\navailable only to a few people at first, since a \u201cmajor\u201d\nrevelation immediately apparent for a global audience would obscure\nGod\u2019s love with overwhelming power. King provides a list of\npossible evidences that satisfy the requirement of discreetness,\nincluding \u201ca sense of [divine] presence\u201d, \u201cinternal\ncommunication (including dreams, visions)\u201d, \u201cfulfilled\nprophecies, Resurrection, Incarnation\u201d. Any conceivable\nrevelation must choose its means from this list and hence conform to a\nnecessary structure, which accommodates the cognitive limitations of\nhuman beings and makes it possible for them to trust in a rational\nway. King refers to his epistemological model as\n\u201ctrust-evidentialism\u201d (2008: 174, 176).\n\nEven though King\u2019s account is ostensibly different from the\nnon-inferential testimonial models presented above, the differences\nmight be smaller than first appears. As we have seen, \u201cdoxastic\nresponsibility\u201d requires extensive reasoning from evidence in\nWahlberg\u2019s account, even though such reasoning is construed as\ndefeater-deflecting rather than as trust-grounding.\n\nAs the example of King illustrates, inferential models for the\njustification of revelation can be construed as testimonial, if\ntestimonial justification is understood in a reductionist way. John\nLocke is a classic example of this. \n\n\nFaith \u2026 is the assent to any proposition \u2026 upon the\ncredit of the proposer, as coming from God, in some extraordinary way\nof communication. This way of discovering truths to men we call\nRevelation. (Essay Concerning Human Understanding,\nIV, xviii, 2) \n\n\nHowever, testimonial justification, for Locke, is reducible to\nargument from evidence.\n2.3.1 A Probabilistic Argument\n\nIn order to see the general strengths and problems of inferential\nmodels of justification, it will be helpful to focus on a paradigmatic\nexample in the tradition of Tillotson and Locke. Perhaps the most\ninfluential evidentialist account of the justification of revelatory\nclaims is the one proposed by Richard Swinburne. His argument can be\nformalized using probability calculus and Bayes Theorem (Swinburne\n2007: 345\u2013356), but the discussion below will proceed\ninformally. After a presentation of Swinburne\u2019s argument, some\ncritical and complementary perspectives will be addressed. \n\nFor Swinburne, rational acceptance of a revelatory claim must be based\non evidence, and how strong the evidence needs to be depends on what\nbackground beliefs we have. If we have good reason to believe,\nindependently of any purported revelation, that God exists and that a\nrevelation from him is to be expected, then rational acceptance of a\nrevelatory claim can be based on more modest evidence than would\notherwise be the case. It is hence important for Swinburne to build a\ncase for the existence of God based on natural theology, and then\nestablish the likelihood of a revelation on the basis of a\npriori reasoning about what God is likely to do.\n\nSwinburne thinks that natural theological arguments make God\u2019s\nexistence at least as probable as his non-existence, and that a\npriori reasoning about God leads to the conclusion that a\nrevelation is to be expected. A God who has made rational creatures\nwould want to interact with them, and for this to be possible, they\nwould need to know more about God\u2019s nature and character than\nwhat is naturally accessible to them. Furthermore, it would be good\nfor humans to receive moral enlightenment from God, and encouragement\nto live morally good lives. Since God is good, these considerations\nmake a revelation likely. Moreover, Swinburne argues that a good God\nwould have reason to become incarnate in order to atone for\nsin and to identify with our suffering. If this is to be effectual, a\nrevelation that tells us about the incarnation and atonement is\nnecessary. It is also to be expected that a divine revelation would\nnot come with overwhelming evidence in its favor but require some\nsearching activity on the part of humans. This would encourage human\ncooperation and co-responsibility and strengthen desire for the goal\nof salvation. Since a revelation would have to be translated between\ndifferent cultures and across time, there must also be included in the\nrevelation some means of continuing guidance\u2014a church that can\nensure that interpretations and translations are correct (Swinburne\n2007: 103\u2013104. For a more fully developed perspective on the\necclesial mediation of revelation, see Levering 2014).\n\nArmed with the purported background knowledge that a certain kind of\nrevelation is likely, Swinburne suggests four \u201ctests\u201d or\ncriteria for credible revelatory claims (Swinburne 2007: Ch. 6). The\nfirst criterion is that the content of a purported revelation concerns\nthings that are important for our deepest well-being, and that this\ncontent is not very improbable on grounds independent of revelation.\nThis \u201ccontent test\u201d must be complemented by a\n\u201cmiracle test\u201d, which is the second criterion. If God\nwants us to be able to identify a divine revelation as such, he must\ndeliver it in a way that only God could do. This requires a divine\nsignature in the form of a confirming miracle, in the sense of a\nviolation of a natural law. Third, if a revelation is to have a\ndeterminate content that is not endlessly open to interpretation, a\ngenuine revelation must contain instructions for how an interpretive\nchurch is to be constituted, and the interpretations of this church\nmust be plausible as interpretations of the original revelation. The\nfourth test is that the church\u2019s interpretations of revelation\nmust not be very implausible on other, independent grounds.\n\nWhen applying these tests to the great world religions, Swinburne\nclaims to find that the purported Christian revelation is the only\nserious candidate. No other religion can point to a reasonable amount\nof evidence for a foundational, authenticating miracle like the\nresurrection of Jesus, nor does any other religion satisfy the other\nthree tests. This shows that the coincidence of the satisfaction of\nall four tests (even to a moderate degree) \u201cis an extremely\nunlikely event in the normal course of things\u201d (Swinburne 2007:\n337). Since Christianity satisfies all four tests, according to\nSwinburne, it is very probable that its purported revelation is true.\nIn order to show that Christianity satisfies the tests, Swinburne\nproduces a complex argument based on evidence from many sources (for\nexample, historical arguments about the acts and teachings of Jesus,\nevidence for the resurrection, arguments for the moral goodness of\nChristian teachings, etc.). It is the cumulative force of the total\nevidence that makes belief in the Christian revelatory claim\njustified.\n\nA general criticism that can be directed against Swinburne\u2019s\naccount\u2014as well as other inferential accounts (e.g., King\n2008)\u2014is that it seems to draw on the Christian religion as a\nkind of intuition-pump for what are supposed to be \u201ca\npriori\u201d features of any genuine revelation. For example,\nSwinburne argues that it is a priori likely that God will\nbecome incarnated and atone for human sin, and that this therefore is\na part of the content-criterion by which to test purported\nrevelations. Many would argue, however, that this reasoning is\n\u201cad hoc and post eventum\u201d and biased in\nfavor of the Christian tradition (Abraham 2006: 73. See also Stump\n1994: 740; McLean 2013).\n\nSwinburne\u2019s argument invites detailed objections on practically\nevery point, but he has also defended every step of the argument\nextensively in separate works about natural theology, the incarnation,\natonement theory, and the resurrection (2004a; 1994; 1989; 2003).\nEspecially the historical argument for a resurrection is crucial for\nSwinburne\u2019s case. The debates generated by criticism of\nSwinburne\u2019s historical claims and claims about natural theology\ncannot be addressed here. However, the very fact that\nSwinburne\u2019s argument, in order to succeed, needs to establish\nmany controversial propositions has been seen, by some, as a fatal\nweakness (Plantinga 2000b, 271\u2013280; Hasker 2002: 256\u2013257).\n\nAppealing to a general \u201cprinciple of dwindling\nprobabilities\u201d, Plantinga has argued that complex inferential\ncases for Christianity of the kind Swinburne presents must necessarily\nfail. Such complex arguments chain together a number of logically\nindependent propositions, most of which are merely probable given the\nevidence. For every merely probable proposition that is needed to\nreach the conclusion, the probability of the hypothesis as a whole\nwill decrease, since the probabilities at each stage of the argument\nmust be multiplied. Plantinga argues that even if the probabilities of\nthe individual propositions are given a very generous\nestimate\u2014for example, if we assign the probability 0.9 to the\nproposition that God exists (on our background knowledge)\u2014the\noverall conclusion about the Christian revelation will still have a\nprobability well below 0.5. Plantinga, therefore, concludes that the\ninferential case for the Christian revelation \n\n\nisn\u2019t strong enough to produce warranted belief \u2026 at\nmost, it could produce the warranted belief that the main lines of\nChristian teaching aren\u2019t particularly improbable. (Plantinga\n2000b: 271)\n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s argument seems to threaten the whole inferential\nproject. In response, however, it can be argued that it proves too\nmuch. All historical arguments (even secular ones) link together\npropositions that are merely probable. If the principle of dwindling\nprobabilities is valid and has the implications that Plantinga claims,\nit could be applied to all historical arguments, with the result that\nno historical argument could succeed. This, however, is a conclusion\nthat many would be reluctant to draw (Swinburne 2004b: 540; 2007:\n356).\n\nTim and Lydia McGrew have provided what many take to be a strong\nresponse to Plantinga\u2019s argument from dwindling probabilities\n(McGrew 2004; McGrew and McGrew 2006). Basically, they argue that at\nleast the steepness of the \u201cdwindling\u201d is an illusion\ncreated by the way Plantinga (mis)represents the\ninferential-historical case for a Christian revelation. Among other\nshortcomings, Plantinga\u2019s construal fails to bring out how\nevidence for a proposition that is \u201cdownstream\u201d in the\nargument (such as \u201cGod raised Jesus from the dead\u201d) is\nrelevant for assessing the probability of a proposition that is\n\u201cupstream\u201d (such as \u201cGod exists\u201d). While\nPlantinga concedes ground to some of the critique (2006), he\nnevertheless stands by his general argument (2015: 262. For an\noverview of the debate, see Nickel 2015: 225\u2013235 and Crisp\n2009.)\n2.3.2 Holism\n\nAnother response to the purported threat of dwindling probabilities is\nsuggested by Menssen and Sullivan (2007). They defend a basically\nSwinburnian inferential project, but criticize Swinburne for being\ninsufficiently holistic, in a sense to be explained below (2007:\n55\u201356). With respect to the argument about dwindling\nprobabilities, they acknowledge that a complex proposition cannot have\na greater probability than any of its constituent claims. However,\nthey argue that in certain cases, the complex proposition \u201ccould\nstill be more believable\u201d (2007: 61). For example, the\nclaim that \u201cthere is a heavenly body beyond Uranus that is\nperturbing its orbit\u201d is more complex than the weaker claim that\n\u201cthere is a heavenly body beyond Uranus\u201d. Nevertheless,\nscientists did not first attempt to prove the weaker claim, and then\nwent on to prove the stronger (more complex) claim. Instead, they\nestablished the truth of the weaker claim by establishing the\ntruth of the stronger.\n\nThe lesson to learn from this, according to Menssen and Sullivan, is\nthat the project of justifying revelatory claims should not await the\nestablishing of God\u2019s existence by means of traditional natural\ntheology (as suggested by Swinburne 2004b: 538 and Mavrodes 1988: 102). Instead,\nrevelatory claims should be investigated as part of the project of\njustifying theism\u2014the only condition for such investigation\nbeing that the existence of a world-creator is not highly unlikely. In\nfact, \n\n\na negative conclusion concerning the existence of a good God is not\njustified unless the content of a reasonable number of leading\nrevelatory claims has been seriously considered. (Menssen and Sullivan\n2007: 63) \n\n\nThis is because the \u201cproblem of evil\u201d counts as evidence\nagainst God\u2019s existence. To exclude putative revelations from\nconsideration before God\u2019s existence has been established would\nbe to refuse to \u201clisten to the voice of the accused\u201d. What\nif a putative revelation contains an acceptable explanation of evil,\nthat blocks or weakens the atheistic arguments? Not to take this\npossibility into account would, arguably, be to handicap the\nevidentialist project by forcing it to proceed without a \u201cfull\ndatabase\u201d (Kwan 2011: 472). Hence, the \u201cholistic\u201d\napproach of Menssen and Sullivan might be seen as an improvement in\nrelation to the more traditional, \u201clayered\u201d approach of\nSwinburne. (However, Swinburne\u2019s distinction between\n\u201cbare\u201d and \u201cramified\u201d natural theology point\nin a holistic direction, see 2004b: 533\u2013535.)\n2.3.3 Voluntarism\n\nOther critics of Swinburne point out that he ignores the role played\nby emotions, desires and the will in coming to faith (Hasker 2002:\n257\u2013258). Is belief in a divine revelation only a matter of\nBayesian calculation of probabilities? This lacuna in\nSwinburne\u2019s thought\u2014as well as in much evidentialist\nreflection in general\u2014has been addressed by Paul Moser, who\nintroduces an existential-affective dimension in the inferential\nproject. His central claim is that our access to evidence for\nGod\u2019s existence might depend on our volitional and affective\nstates (2008; 2010. See also Wainwright 2006).\n\nMoser believes that God is \u201chidden\u201d, at least for some\npeople some of the time, in the sense that his existence is not beyond\nreasonable doubt. This fact should not be taken as a reason for\nskepticism, however, since it is to be expected that a perfectly\nloving God would only make evidence of his existence available when\nthis is likely to elicit the right human response. God does not reveal\nhimself simply in order to slake our curiosity, but only with the\npurpose of accomplishing, in a non-coercive way, a moral\ntransformation of humans to align their wills and character with\nGod\u2019s character and purposes. We should hence expect evidence\nfor God to be purposively available.\n\nMoser claims that his emphasis on the volitional element in our\nepistemic responses to divine revelation constitutes \u201ca\nCopernican Revolution in cognitive matters about God\u2019s\nexistence\u201d (2008: 4). However, it would be more accurate to say\nthat he revives a classical theme, found in the church fathers and\nAquinas (Macdonald 2009a: 137). For Aquinas, for example, it is the\nwill that moves the intellect to the assent of faith (as emphasized by\nthe \u201cvoluntarist interpretation\u201d, see\n section 2.1\n above).\n\nAnother philosopher who stresses the personal dimension of faith and\nits epistemic relevance is Abraham, who notes that revelation is a\n\u201cthreshold concept\u201d. By accepting a revelatory claim,\none\u2019s perception of the world changes in a fundamental way. This\nis a \u201cprofoundly self-involving experience\u201d and a\n\u201cmassive cognitive and spiritual revolution\u201d (Abraham\n2006: 87, 89). \n2.3.4 Hybridism\n\nFinally, it must be considered whether a \u201chybrid\u201d approach\nto revelatory claims\u2014combining inferential and non-inferential\nmodes of justification\u2014might be fruitful. Abraham (2006 and\n1982) suggests that this is the case. Inspired by Plantinga\u2019s\ntheory of a sensus divinitatis, Abraham claims that we come\nequipped with an oculus contemplationis, \u201ca\nspiritually discerning eye\u201d that allows us to discern\nGod\u2019s presence and activity in nature and history through a\n\u201cbasic cognitive act\u201d (2006: 69). \n\nHowever, Abraham considers arguments from evidence to be\n\u201csupplementary to the appeal to the oculus\ncontemplationis\u201d. Miracles, for example, have a genuine\nepistemic freight and the kind of data appealed to in evidentialist\nreasoning about revelation can \n\n\noperate as corroborating evidence that coheres with and thus\nstrengthens the initial beliefs legitimately formed independently of\npropositional evidence. (2006: 72, 77)\n\n\nAbraham\u2019s portrayal of revelation as a \u201cthreshold\nconcept\u201d also seems to open up the possibility of a kind of\n\u201cretroactive\u201d justification: Once a revelatory claim has\nbeen accepted, the new perspective one has gained will make one\ncapable of seeing the cognitive errors of one\u2019s previous\nposition. Charles Taylor has described this kind of retroactive\njustification as a \u201csupersession argument\u201d (2005:\n340\u2013341).\n2.4 Sui Generis Approaches\n\nA possibility (or purported possibility) that has not been considered\nso far, is that belief in divine revelation could be justified in a\nway that is totally sui generis. Inspired by Kierkegaard,\nKarl Barth seems to suggest something like this. Human nature is not\nin any way adapted to receive knowledge of God, according to Barth,\nand hence there can be no philosophical explanation of how knowledge\nof God comes about. However, God himself could provide such knowledge\nwithout respecting the criteria of any epistemological canon. Barth\nwriters:\n\n\nTo say \u201cGod with us\u201d is to say something which has no\nbasis or possibility outside itself, which can in no sense be\nexplained in terms of man and man\u2019s situation, but only as\nknowledge of God from God, as free and unmerited grace. As the Bible\nbears witness to God\u2019s revelation and as Church proclamation\ntakes up this witness in obedience, both renounce any foundation apart\nfrom that which God has given once and for all by speaking (Barth\n1975: 119\u2013120).\n\n\nCritics have accused Barth of portraying revelation \n\n\nas something having full authority over the insights of reason and\nsensibility, and as not in any way subject to them. (Quash 2007: 334)\n\n\n\nAccording to Pannenberg, this is equivalent to fideism. \n\n\nBarth\u2019s apparently so lofty objectivity about God and\nGod\u2019s word turns out to rest on no more than the irrational\nsubjectivity of a venture of faith with no justification outside\nitself. (1976: 273)\n\n\nIn response to this kind of criticism, theologians in the\n\u201cpostliberal\u201d tradition (inspired by Barth) have argued\nthat revelation is not an epistemological concept at all. The\nChristian doctrine of revelation does not purport to explain how\nChristina beliefs are justified. Instead, it provides an\nintra-theological explication of God\u2019s prevenient grace\n(Thiemann 1985: 4). Some have even gone so far as to say that\n\u201cthe very idea that the Bible is revealed \u2026 is a claim\nthat creates more trouble than it is worth\u201d (Hauerwas 1981: 57).\nFor postliberal theologians in general, Christian beliefs are\njustified by being part of a coherent web of beliefs (Marshall\n2000).\n\nHowever, perhaps a better way of defending Barth is suggested by Hans\nUrs von Balthasar. He shares Barth\u2019s general view of revelation\nas epistemically self-authenticating and as providing its own warrant,\nindependently of human preconceptions (Chapp 2004: 11). However,\nBalthasar attempts to make this view intelligible by suggesting an\nanalogy with aesthetic experience. In Mozart\u2019s Jupiter\nSymphony, for example, every note seems to be necessary in the\nsense that any change would make the symphony less beautiful. However,\nnobody (except Mozart himself) could have said in advance that\nprecisely this combination of notes is necessary in order to\nproduce such beauty. Hence, our recognition of the beauty or\nperfection of the symphony happens without reference to any criteria\nor rules that we could have stated independently of encountering the\nsymphony itself. In a similar way, revelation possesses its own\nintrinsic credibility, rooted in the self-authenticating glory of God.\n\u201cDivine love\u201d, writes Balthasar, \n\n\ncan appear in such an overwhelming way that its glorious majesty\nthrows one to the ground; it shines out as the last word and leaves\none no choice but to respond in the mode of pure, blind obedience.\n(Balthasar 2004: 53, 57) \n",
