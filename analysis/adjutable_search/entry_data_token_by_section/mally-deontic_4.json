    "main_text": "Surprising Consequences\n5. Surprising Consequences\n\nMally called theorems (1), (2), (7), (22) and (27)\u2013(35)\n\u201csurprising\u201d (befremdlich) or even\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d (paradox). He viewed (34) and (35)\nas the most surprising of his surprising theorems. But Mally\u2019s reasons\nfor calling these theorems surprising are puzzling if not\nconfused.\n\nConsider, for example, theorem (1). Mally interpreted this theorem as\nfollows: \u201cif A requires B, then A requires everything that is\nthe case\u201d (Mally 1926, p.\u00a020). He regarded this as a\nsurprising claim, and we agree. However, Mally\u2019s interpretation of (1)\nis not warranted. (1) only says that if A requires B, then A requires\nthe Verum. The expression \u201cif A requires B, then A\nrequires everything that is the case\u201d is to be formalized as\n\n\n(1\u2032)\n(A f B) \u2192 (C \u2192 (A f C)) \n\n\nThis formula is an immediate consequence of (1) in virtue of\nAxiom\u00a0I. In other words, Mally should have reasoned as follows:\n(1\u2032) is surprising; but (1\u2032) is an immediate consequence\nof (1) in virtue of Axiom\u00a0I; Axiom\u00a01 is uncontroversial; so\n(1) is to be regarded as surprising.\n\n\nA similar pattern is to be seen in many of Mally\u2019s other remarks about\ntheorems which surprised him. He generally read too much into them and\nconfused them with some of the consequences they had in his\nsystem:\n\nMally was surprised by (2) because he thought that it says that if\nA requires B and B is not the case, then A requires every state of\naffairs whatsoever (Mally 1926, p.\u00a021). But (2) says no such\nthing. Mally\u2019s paraphrase is a paraphrase of (A f B) \u2192 (\u00acB\n\u2192 (A f C)) (a consequence of (2) in virtue of Axiom\u00a0I)\nrather than (2).\nMally paraphrased (7) as \u201cif anything is required, then\neverything that is the case is required\u201d (Mally 1926,\np.\u00a028), which is indeed surprising. However, Mally\u2019s paraphrase\ncorresponds with !A \u2192 (B \u2192 !B) (a consequence of (7) in\nvirtue of Axiom\u00a0I) rather than (7).\nMally paraphrased (22) as \u201cthe facts ought to be the\ncase\u201d (Mally 1926, p.\u00a024). We grant that this is a\nsurprising claim. But the corresponding formula in Mally\u2019s language is\nA \u2192 !A (a consequence of (22) in virtue of Axiom\u00a0I), not\n(22).\nMally read (27) as \u201cif something which ought not to be the\ncase is the case, then anything whatsoever ought to be the case\u201d\n(Mally 1926, pp.\u00a024, 33), but this is a paraphrase of !\u00acA\n\u2192 (A \u2192 !B) (a theorem of Mally\u2019s system) rather than\n(27).\nMally paraphrased (33) as \u201cwhat is not the case is not\nobligatory\u201d (Mally 1926, p.\u00a025) and as \u201ceverything\nthat is obligatory is the case\u201d (Mally 1926, p.\u00a034). These\nassertions are indeed surprising, but Mally\u2019s readings of (33) are not\nwarranted. They are paraphrases of !A \u2192 A rather than (33).\nMally made the following remark about (34) and (35):\n\n\n\nThe latter sentences, which seem to identify being obligatory with\nbeing the case, are surely the most surprising of our\n\u201csurprising\n consequences.\u201d[4]\n\n\nHowever, (34) and (35) do not assert that being obligatory is\nequivalent with being the case, for the latter statement should be\nformalized as A \u2194 !A. The latter formula is a theorem of Mally\u2019s\nsystem, as will be shown in a moment, but it is not to be found in\nMally\u2019s book. \n\n\nMally regarded theorems (28)\u2013(32) as surprising because of their\nrelationships with certain other surprising theorems:\n\n(28)\u2013(30) are instantiations of (27). But this is not sufficient\nto call these theorems surprising. Mally actually viewed (28) as less\nsurprising than (27): one might use it to justify retaliation and\nrevenge (Mally 1926, p.\u00a024).\n(31) implies (28)\u2013(30) and is therefore at least as surprising as\nthose theorems.\nMally viewed (32) as surprising because the surprising theorem\n(33) is an immediate consequence of (32) and the apparently\nnon-surprising theorem (25).\n\n\nMally\u2019s list of surprising theorems seems too short: for example, (24)\nis equivalent with A \u2192 !A in virtue of Def.\u00a0f. But A \u2192\n!A may be paraphrased as \u201cthe facts ought to be the case,\u201d\nan assertion which Mally regarded as surprising (Mally 1926,\np.\u00a024). So then why didn\u2019t he call (24) surprising? Did it not\nsurprise him after (22)?\n\nEven though Mally regarded many of his theorems as surprising, he\nthought that he had discovered an interesting concept of\n\u201ccorrect willing\u201d (richtiges Wollen) or\n\u201cwilling in accordance with the facts\u201d which should not be\nconfused with the notions of obligation and willing used in ordinary\ndiscourse. Mally\u2019s \u201cexact system of pure ethics\u201d was\nmainly concerned with this concept, but we will not describe this\nsystem because it belongs to the field of ethics rather than deontic\nlogic.\n",
