    "main_text": "The Concept of a Mechanism || Parts\n2.2 Parts\nMechanists have struggled to find a concise way to express the idea\nof parthood required of the components in a mechanism. The project is\nto develop an account that is both sufficiently permissive to include\nthe paradigmatic mechanisms from diverse areas of science and yet not\nvacuous.\nFormal mereologies are difficult to apply to the material parts of\nbiological mechanisms. Axioms of mereology, such as reflexivity\n(everything is a part of itself) and unrestricted composition (any two\nthings form a whole) do not apply in standard biological uses of the\n\u201cpart\u201d concept.\nGlennan (1996) recognized the difficulty of defining parthood very\nearly on. His proposal:\nThe parts of mechanisms must have a kind of\nrobustness and reality apart from their place within that\nmechanism. It should in principle be possible to take the part out of\nthe mechanism and consider its properties in another context. (1996:\n53)\n\n Yet even this is perhaps too strong, given that some parts of a\nmechanism might become unstable when removed from their mechanistic\ncontext. Later, Glennan (2002: S345) says that the properties of a\npart must be stable in the absence of interventions, or that parts\nmust be stable enough to be called objects. This notion is perhaps too\nstrong to accommodate the more ephemeral parts of some biochemical\nmechanisms or of the mechanisms of natural selection (Skipper and\nMillstein 2005; but see Illari and Williamson 2010).\n",
