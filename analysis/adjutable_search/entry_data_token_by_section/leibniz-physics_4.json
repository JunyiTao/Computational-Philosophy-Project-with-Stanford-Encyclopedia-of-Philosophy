    "main_text": "Leibniz on matter || The passive powers of bodies\n2.3 The passive powers of bodies\n\n\nMuch about Leibniz\u2019s own positive conception of matter as it is \nstudied by physics can be gleaned from his criticisms of his \npredecessors. So, for example, his critique of atomism already \nsuggests that Leibnizian bodies must always be flexible or \n\u201csoft\u201d to some \n degree,[13]\n fill every region of the natural world, and be infinitely divisible, \nindeed, be infinitely divided. Likewise, his critique of the \nCartesian conception of matter implies that the properties of bodies \nare not limited to their passive powers, that bodies must always \nadmit of intrinsic variety, and that ordinary physical objects such \nas desks and chairs must be ontologically dependent upon a deeper \nlevel of metaphysical reality. Nonetheless, we should be able to get \nan even better grip on Leibniz\u2019s positive conception of matter by \nlooking more explicitly at four passive powers, or forces, which he \nattributes to bodies as they are studied by the physicist. \n\n\n(1) As we noted above, the physics of the TMA assigns to bodies no \nresistance to motion, and thus predicts that under idealized \nconditions it should be no harder to move something massive than \nsomething minuscule. In distancing himself from this early view, \nLeibniz comes to argue that, in fact, matter \u201cresists being \nmoved through a certain natural inertia it has \u2026 so \nthat it is not indifferent to motion and rest, as is commonly \nbelieved, but requires more active force for motion in proportion to \nits size\u201d (G IV.510/AG 161). In short, Leibniz came to maintain\nthat bodies have an intrinsic power resistant to motion, which he \ncalls, following Kepler, \u201cnatural inertia.\u201d \nSignificantly, Leibnizian natural inertia is a force which is opposed\nto motion itself, and not merely, as Newton held, to changes in \nvelocity. Thus, while Newton maintains that no active force is \nrequired to keep a body moving with a constant velocity under \nidealized conditions, Leibniz maintains that a body in motion in the \nabsence of any countervailing active force will naturally come to \nrest. \n\n\n(2) In addition to offering resistance to motion, Leibniz thought it\nessential to bodies that they resist mutual collocation \u2013 to\nsome degree, they must be \u201csolid\u201d or impenetrable.  In\nattributing solidity to bodies, Leibniz rejects the Cartesian\nsuggestion that impenetrability simply follows from the property of a\nbody\u2019s being extended. For, Leibniz argues, it could be the case\nthat a body\u2019s solidity is due to a body\u2019s having a certain\nreluctance \u2013 but not an unconquerable one \u2013 to share a\nplace with another body, and thus he implies that it is, for example,\nat least conceivable that two bodies might be forced to overlap in\nmuch the same way that we generally imagine bodies and regions of\nspace to coincide (NE, Book II, Ch. iv). Having distinguished solidity\nfrom extension, Leibniz goes on to further distinguish solidity from\nhardness. He suggests that whereas solidity concerns the ability of a\nbody to resist being collocated with another body, hardness concerns\nthe ability of a body to resist changing its shape or structure. Thus\na body, according to Leibniz, might be perfectly solid\n(i.e. impenetrable) and yet not hard, a point he illustrates by noting\nthat \u201cif two bodies were simultaneously inserted into the two\nopen ends of a tube, into which each of them fitted tightly, the\nmatter which was already in the tube, however, fluid [or\n\u2018soft\u2019] it might be, [the matter] would resist just\nbecause of its sheer impenetrability [i.e.\n\u2018solidity\u2019]\u201d (NE, Book II, Ch. iv).\n\n\n(3) In addition to the (relatively) basic powers of natural inertia \nand solidity, Leibniz recognizes two further derived passive powers \nof bodies. The first, which we might call \u201cfirmness\u201d or \n\u201ccohesiveness,\u201d concerns the ability of a body to resist \nbeing scattered or torn into pieces. (An egg and a baseball differ \nnot only with respect to their \u201cnatural inertia\u201d and \nimpenetrability, but also with respect to their ability to hold \nthemselves together, as it were, under impact.) In the New \nEssays, Leibniz writes:\n\n\nBut now a new element enters the picture, namely firmness or\nthe bonding of one body to another. This bonding often results in \none\u2019s being unable to push one body without at the same time pushing \nanother which is bonded to it, so that there is a kind of \ntraction of the second body. Because of this bonding, there \nwould be resistance even if there were no inertia or manifest \nimpetus. For \u2026 if space were full of small cubes, a hard body \nwould encounter resistance to its being moved among them. This is \nbecause the little cubes \u2013 just because they were hard, i.e. \nbecause their parts were bonded together \u2013 would be difficult \nto split up finely enough to permit circular movement in which the \nposition being evacuated by the moving body would at once be refilled\nby something else. (NE Book II, Ch. iv)\n\n\nAlthough Leibniz recognizes \u201cfirmness\u201d as an important \npassive power attributable to bodies, like many other mechanists, he \nis reluctant to posit the existence of primitive attractive forces \nin nature (SD II.52/AG 136; see also Leibniz\u2019s Fifth Letter to \nClarke, paragraph 35/Alexander 66). He thus insists that firmness is \na derived passive power of bodies since \u201cwe should not explain \nfirmness except through the surrounding bodies pushing a body \ntogether\u201d (SD II.52/AG 136). \n\n\n(4) A final passive property of bodies might go without mention if \nnot for the special twist that Leibniz puts on it. Even while arguing\nagainst the Cartesian thesis that the whole essence of matter is \nextension, Leibniz could hardly deny that bodies as they are studied \nby physicists are extended, or if one prefers, that they have the \nproperty of physical extension. Nonetheless, Leibniz intriguingly \nsuggests that physical extension \u2013 far from constituting the \nwhole essence of matter \u2013 is not even a basic property of \nbodies. In an informative piece dated to 1702, Leibniz writes:\n\n\n\u2026 I believe that the nature of body does not consist in \nextension alone \u2026 since extension is a continuous and \nsimultaneous repetition \u2026 it follows that whenever the same \nnature is diffused through many things at the same time, as, for \nexample, malleability or specific gravity or yellowness is in gold, \nwhiteness is in milk, and resistance or impenetrability is generally \nin body, extension is said to have place \u2026 From this, it is \nobvious that extension is not an absolute predicate, but is relative \nto that which is extended or diffused, and therefore it cannot be \nseparated from the nature of that which is diffused \u2026 (G \nIV.393f/AG 251; see also GP II 269/AG 179, and GP II 183/L 519).\n\n\n\nLeibniz thus grants that while physical extension is to be ascribed \nto the bodies of physics, it is not to be treated as a basic or \nfundamental property of matter. Rather, physical extension itself is \nto be understood as a repetition, or distribution, of more basic \nforces. Leibniz\u2019s radical suggestion would, in effect, turn the \nCartesian understanding of matter on its head: whereas, for example, \nDescartes attempted to explain solidity in terms of physical \n extension,[14]\n Leibniz proposes to explain physical extension in terms of solidity \n\u2013 a body isn\u2019t solid because it is extended, it is \nextended because it has the ability to exclude other bodies! \n",
