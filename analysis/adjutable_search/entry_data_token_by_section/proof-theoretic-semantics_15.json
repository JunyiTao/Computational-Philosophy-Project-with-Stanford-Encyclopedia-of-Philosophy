    "main_text": "Extensions and alternatives to standard proof-theoretic semantics || Classical logic\n3.5 Classical logic\n\nProof-theoretic semantics is intuitionistically biased. This is due to\nthe fact that natural deduction as its preferred framework has certain\nfeatures which make it particularly suited for intuitionistic logic.\nIn classical natural deduction the ex falso quodlibet\n\n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$\\bot$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nis replaced with the rule of classical reductio ad\nabsurdum \n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$[A\\to \\bot]$}\n\\noLine\\UnaryInfC{$\\bot$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nIn allowing to discharge \\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\) in order to infer\n\\(A\\), this rule undermines the subformula principle.\nFurthermore, in containing both \\(\\bot\\) and \\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\),\nit refers to two different logical constants in a single rule, so\nthere is no separation of logical constants any more.\nFinally, as an elimination rule for \\(\\bot\\) it does not follow the\ngeneral pattern of introductions and eliminations. As a consequence,\nit destroys the introduction form property that every closed\nderivation can be reduced to one which uses an introduction rule in\nthe last step.\n\nClassical logic fits very well with the multiple-succedent sequent\ncalculus. There we do not need any additional principles beyond those\nassumed in the intuitionistic case. Just the structural feature of\nadmitting more than one formula in the succedent suffices to obtain\nclassical logic. As there are plausible approaches to establish a\nharmony between right-introduction and left-introduction in the\nsequent calculus (see section\n 3.3),\n classical logic appears to be perfectly justified. However, this is\nonly convincing if reasoning is appropriately framed as a\nmultiple-conclusion process, even though this does not correspond to\nour standard practice where we focus on single conclusions. One could\ntry to develop an appropriate intuition by arguing that reasoning\ntowards multiple conclusions delineates the area in which truth lies\nrather than establishing a single proposition as true. However, this\nintuition is hard to maintain and cannot be formally captured without\nserious difficulties. Philosophical approaches such as those by\nShoesmith and Smiley (1978) and proof-theoretic approaches such as\nproof-nets (see Girard, 1987; the entry on\n linear logic)\n are attempts in this direction.\n\nA fundamental reason for the failure of the introduction form property\nin classical logic is the indeterminism inherent in the laws for\ndisjunction. \\(A\\lor B\\) can be inferred from \\(A\\) as well as from\n\\(B\\). Therefore, if the disjunction laws were the only way of\ninferring \\(A\\lor B\\), the derivability of \\(A\\lor \\neg A\\), which is\na key principle of classical logic, would entail that of either \\(A\\)\nor of \\(\\neg A\\), which is absurd. A way out of this difficulty is to\nabolish indeterministic disjunction and use instead its classical de\nMorgan equivalent \\(\\neg(\\neg A \\land \\neg B)\\). This leads\nessentially to a logic without proper disjunction. In the quantifier\ncase, there would be no proper existential quantifier either, as\n\\(\\exists xA\\) would be understood in the sense of \\(\\neg \\forall\nx\\neg A\\). If one is prepared to accept this restriction, then certain\nharmony principles can be formulated for classical logic.\n\nAs Karl Popper was the first to observe (see Binder et al., 2022), the\nsimple combination of rules for classical and intuitionistic\nconnectives collapses into the classical system. More sophisticated\ntheories that combine classical and intuitionistic systems in a\nfaithful way are found in ecumenical systems (see Pimentel\nand Pereira 2021). Approaches to classical logic originally developed\nin computer science by algorithmic considerations, in particular in\nthe context of proof search, are Michel Parigot\u2019s \\(\\lambda\n\\mu\\)-calculus (Parigot 1992) and the application of the focusing\nmethod to classical logic (Liang and Miller, 2009; 2023). Both\napproaches rest on the idea that by certain indexing techniques a\nsingle formula in the multiple-formula succedent of a classical\nsequent can be distinguished and dealt with individually.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor classical logic in general see the entry on\n classical logic.\n",
