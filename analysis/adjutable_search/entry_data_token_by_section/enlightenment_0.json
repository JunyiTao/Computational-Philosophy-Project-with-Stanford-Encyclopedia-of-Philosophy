    "main_text": "The True: Science, Epistemology and Metaphysics in the Enlightenment\n1. The True: Science, Epistemology and Metaphysics in the Enlightenment\n\nIn this era dedicated to human progress, the advancement of the\nnatural sciences is regarded as the main exemplification of, and fuel\nfor, such progress. Isaac Newton\u2019s epochal accomplishment in his\nPrincipia Mathematica (1687), which, very briefly described,\nconsists in the comprehension of a diversity of physical phenomena\n\u2013 in particular the motions of heavenly bodies, together with\nthe motions of sublunary bodies \u2013 in few relatively simple,\nuniversally applicable, mathematical laws, was a great stimulus to the\nintellectual activity of the eighteenth century and served as a model\nand inspiration for the researches of a number of Enlightenment\nthinkers. Newton\u2019s system strongly encourages the Enlightenment\nconception of nature as an orderly domain governed by strict\nmathematical-dynamical laws and the conception of ourselves\nas capable of knowing those laws and of plumbing the secrets of nature\nthrough the exercise of our unaided faculties. \u2013 The conception\nof nature, and of how we know it, changes significantly with the rise\nof modern science. It belongs centrally to the agenda of Enlightenment\nphilosophy to contribute to the new knowledge of nature, and to\nprovide a metaphysical framework within which to place and interpret\nthis new knowledge.\n",
