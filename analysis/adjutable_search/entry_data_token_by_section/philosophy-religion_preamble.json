    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy of religion is the philosophical examination of the themes\nand concepts involved in religious traditions as well as the broader\nphilosophical task of reflecting on matters of religious significance\nincluding the nature of religion itself, alternative concepts of God\nor ultimate reality, and the religious significance of general\nfeatures of the cosmos (e.g., the laws of nature, the emergence of\nconsciousness) and of historical events (e.g., the 1755 Lisbon\nEarthquake, the Holocaust). Philosophy of religion also includes the\ninvestigation and assessment of worldviews (such as secular\nnaturalism) that are alternatives to religious worldviews. Philosophy\nof religion involves all the main areas of philosophy: metaphysics,\nepistemology, value theory (including moral theory and applied\nethics), philosophy of language, science, history, politics, art, and\nso on. Section 1 offers an overview of the field and its significance,\nwith subsequent sections covering developments in the field since the\nmid-twentieth century. These sections address philosophy of religion\nas practiced primarily (but not exclusively) in departments of\nphilosophy and religious studies that are in the broadly analytic\ntradition. The entry gives significant attention to theism, but it\nconcludes with highlighting the increasing breadth of the field, as\nmore traditions outside the Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity,\nand Islam) have become the focus of important philosophical work. \n",
