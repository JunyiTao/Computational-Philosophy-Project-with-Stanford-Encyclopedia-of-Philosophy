    "main_text": "Default Interpretations in Semantics and Pragmatics || Presumptive Meanings and Cancellability\n1.3 Presumptive Meanings and Cancellability\n\nStephen Levinson (1995, 2000) argues for default interpretations that\nhe calls presumptive meanings and classifies as implicatures.\nHe uses the term borrowed from Grice, generalized conversational\nimplicatures (GCIs), but ascribes some properties to them that\ndifferentiate them from Grice\u2019s GCIs. For Levinson, GCIs are\nneither properly semantic nor properly pragmatic. They should not be\nregarded as part of semantics as, for example, in Discourse\nRepresentation Theory (Kamp and Reyle 1993), nor should they be seen\nas a result of context-dependent inference performed by the hearer in\nthe process of the recovery of the speaker\u2019s intention. Instead,\n\u201cthey sit midway, systematically influencing grammar and\nsemantics on the one hand and speaker-meaning on the other.\u201d\n(Levinson 2000: 25).\n\nSuch presumed meanings are the result of rational, communicative\nbehaviour and arise through three assumed heuristics: (1) \u2018What\nisn\u2019t said, isn\u2019t\u2019; (2) \u2018What is expressed\nsimply is stereotypically exemplified\u2019, and (3)\n\u2018What\u2019s said in an abnormal way isn\u2019t normal\u2019,\ncalled Q, I, and M heuristics (principles) respectively.\nLevinson\u2019s GCIs, unlike their Gricean progenitors, can arise at\nvarious stages in utterance processing: the hearer need not have\nprocessed the whole proposition before arriving at some presumed\nmeanings. Also, unlike Grice\u2019s GCIs that are taken to be\nspeaker\u2019s intended meanings, Levinson\u2019s presumptive\nmeanings seem to be hearer\u2019s meanings, obtained by the\nhearer as a result of the assumptions he or she made in the process of\nutterance interpretation (see Saul 2002 and Horn 2006 for discussion).\nOn the other hand, like Grice\u2019s GCIs, they are cancellable\nwithout contradiction.\n\nNow, when defaults are delimited by contextual salience, arguably,\ncancellation may not occur except for cases of miscommunication. In\nother words, when the meaning is salient in a given context, it is\nlikely that it had been meant by the speaker unless the speaker\nmisjudged the common ground. But when they are understood as\nlanguage-system-driven meanings, \u00e0 la Levinson\u2019s GCIs,\ncancellability constitutes direct evidence of such defaultness.\nSalient components of meaning added to the overtly expressed content\n(in the form of additional information or choices of interpretation)\ntend to be entrenched and as such difficult to cancel. But as\nJaszczolt (2009a, 2016a) demonstrates, cancellability is a property\nthat does not side with implicit as opposed to explicit content but\nrather with salience. If the main intended message is communicated\nindirectly, as in (8b), then it is the implicature (8c) that is\ndifficult to cancel.\n\n(8)(Fred and Wilma talking about Wilma\u2019s piano recital)\n(8a)Fred: Was the recital a success?\n(8b)Wilma: Lots of people left before the end.\n(8c)The recital was not a success.\n\nThe presence or absence of cancellation in utterance interpretation is\nstill a matter of dispute. It is difficult at present to decide\nbetween the rival views (i) that a particular GCI arose and was\nsubsequently cancelled or (ii) that it did not arise at all due to\nbeing blocked by the context. There is not sufficient experimental\nevidence to support either stance. The answer to this question is\nclosely dependent on the answer to the so-called globalism-localism\ndispute. If, as Levinson claims, default interpretations arise\n\u2018locally\u2019, out of the processing of a pre-propositional\nunit such as a word or a phrase, then they have to be subjected to\nfrequent cancellation once the proposition has been processed. If,\nhowever, despite the incrementality of the interpretation process they\narise post-propositionally, or \u2018globally\u2019, in accordance\nwith Grice\u2019s original assumption, then utterance interpretation\ncan proceed without costly backtracking (see Geurts 2009; Jaszczolt\n2008, 2009a, 2016a; Noveck & Sperber 2004).\n",
