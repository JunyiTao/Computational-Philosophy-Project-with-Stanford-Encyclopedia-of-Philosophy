    "main_text": "Interaction with Other Notions\n4. Interaction with Other Notions\n\nIn this section we focus on how grounding might be related to the\nnotions of necessity, essence, and fundamentality. There are\ninteresting issues concerning the relationship between grounding and\nother phenomena that we don\u2019t have the space to discuss here. In\naddition to the examples listed at the beginning of this entry (e.g.,\nreal definition and truthmaking), one such issue concerns the relation\nbetween grounding and degrees of reality. Indeed, K. McDaniel\n(2017: Ch. 8) sketches an account of the former in terms of the\nlatter.\n",
