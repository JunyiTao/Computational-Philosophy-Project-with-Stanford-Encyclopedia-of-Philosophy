Hilbert\u2019s Program and G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems\n\nThere has been some debate over the impact of\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems\n on Hilbert\u2019s Program, and whether it was the first or the\nsecond incompleteness theorem that delivered the coup de\ngr\u00e2ce. Undoubtedly the opinion of those most directly\ninvolved in the developments were convinced that the theorems did have\na decisive impact. G\u00f6del announced the second incompleteness\ntheorem in an abstract published in October 1930: no consistency proof\nof systems such as\n Principia,\n Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, or the \nsystems investigated by Ackermann and von\nNeumann is possible by methods which can be formulated in these\nsystems. In the full version of his paper,\n G\u00f6del (1931)\n left open the possibility that there could be finitary methods which\nare not formalizable in these systems and which would yield the\nrequired consistency proofs. Bernays\u2019s first reaction in a\nletter to G\u00f6del in January 1931 was likewise that \u201cif, as\nvon Neumann does, one takes it as certain that any and every finitary\nconsideration may be formalized within the system \\(P\\)\u2014like\nyou, I regard that in no way as settled\u2014one comes to the\nconclusion that a finitary demonstration of the consistency of \\(P\\)\nis impossible\u201d\n (G\u00f6del, 2003a,\n 87).\n\nHow do G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems impact Hilbert\u2019s program?\nThrough a careful (\u201cG\u00f6del\u201d-) coding of sequences of\nsymbols (formulas, proofs), G\u00f6del showed that in theories \\(T\\)\nwhich contain a sufficient amount of arithmetic, it is possible to\nproduce a formula \\(Pr(x, y)\\) which \u201csays\u201d that \\(x\\) is\n(the code of) a proof of (the formula with code) \\(y\\). Specifically,\nif \\(\\ulcorner 0 = 1\\urcorner\\) is the code of the formula \\(0 = 1\\),\nthen \\(Con_T = \\forall x \\neg Pr(x,\\ulcorner 0 = 1\\urcorner)\\) may be\ntaken to \u201csay\u201d that \\(T\\) is consistent (no number is the\ncode of a derivation in \\(T\\) of \\(0 = 1)\\). The second incompleteness\ntheorem (G2) says that under certain assumptions about \\(T\\) and the\ncoding apparatus, \\(T\\) does not prove \\(Con_T\\). Now suppose there\nwere a finitary consistency proof of \\(T\\). The methods used in such a\nproof would presumably be formalizable in \\(T\\).\n(\u201cFormalizable\u201d means that, roughly, if the proof uses a\nfinitary operation \\(f\\) on derivations which transforms any\nderivation \\(D\\) into a derivation \\(f (D)\\) of a simple form; then\nthere is a formula \\(F(x, y)\\) so that, for all derivations \\(D,T\n\\vdash F(\\ulcorner D\\urcorner ,\\ulcorner f (D)\\urcorner)\\).) The\nconsistency of \\(T\\) would be finitarily expressed as the general\nhypothetical that, if \\(D\\) is any given sequence of symbols, \\(D\\) is\nnot a derivation in \\(T\\) of the formula \\(0 = 1\\). The formalization\nof this proposition is the formula \\(\\neg Pr(x,\\ulcorner 0 =\n1\\urcorner)\\) in which the variable \\(x\\) occurs free. If there were a\nfinitary proof of the consistency of \\(T\\), its formalization would\nyield a derivation in \\(T\\) of \\(\\neg Pr_T (x,\\ulcorner 0 =\n1\\urcorner),\\) from which \\(Con_T\\) can be derived in \\(T\\) by simple\nuniversal generalization on \\(x\\). Yet, a derivation of \\(Con_T\\) in\n\\(T\\) is ruled out by G2.\n\nAs mentioned above, initially G\u00f6del and Bernays thought that the\ndifficulty for the consistency proof of \\(\\PA\\) could be overcome by\nemploying methods which, although not formalizable in \\(\\PA\\), are\nnonetheless finitary. Whether such methods would be considered\nfinitary according to the original conception of finitism or\nconstitute an extension of the original finitist viewpoint is a matter\nof debate. The new methods considered included a finitary version of\nthe \\(\\omega\\)-rule proposed by Hilbert\n (1931b;\n 1931a). It is fair to say, however, \nthat after about 1934 it\nhas been almost universally accepted that the methods of proof\naccepted as finitary prior to G\u00f6del\u2019s results are all\nformalizable in \\(\\PA\\). Extensions of the original finitist\nstandpoint have been proposed and defended on broadly finitary\ngrounds, e.g.,\n Gentzen (1936)\n defended the use of transfinite induction up to \\(\\varepsilon_0\\) in\nhis consistency proof for \\(\\PA\\) as \u201cindisputable,\u201d\n Takeuti (1987)\n gave another defense.\n G\u00f6del (1958)\n presented another extension of the finitist standpoint; the work of\nKreisel mentioned above may be seen as another attempt to extend\nfinitism while retaining the spirit of Hilbert\u2019s original\nconception.\n\nA different attempt at providing a way around G\u00f6del\u2019s\nsecond theorem for Hilbert\u2019s Program was proposed by Detlefsen\n (1986;\n 2001;\n 1979).\n Detlefsen presents several lines of defense, one of which is similar\nto the one just described: arguing that a version of the\n\\(\\omega\\)-rule is finitarily acceptable, although not capable of\nformalization (however, see\n Ignjatovic 1994).\n Detlefsen\u2019s other argument against the common interpretation of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s second theorem focuses on the notion of\nformalization: That the particular formalization of \u201c\\(T\\) is\nconsistent\u201d by G\u00f6del\u2019s formula \\(Con_T\\) is not\nprovable does not imply that there couldn\u2019t be other formulas,\nwhich are provable in \\(T\\), and which have as much right to\nbe called \u201cformalizations of the consistency of \\(T\\).\u201d\nThese rely on different formalizations of the provability predicate\n\\(Pr_T\\) than the standard ones. It is known that formalized\nconsistency statements are unprovable whenever the provability\npredicate obeys certain general derivability conditions. Detlefsen\nargues that these conditions are not necessary for a predicate to\ncount as a genuine provability predicate, and indeed there are\nprovability predicates which violate the provability conditions and\nwhich give rise to consistency formulas which are provable in\ntheir corresponding theories. These, however, depend on non-standard\nconceptions of provability which would likely not have been accepted\nby Hilbert (see also\n Resnik 1974,\n Auerbach 1992 and\n Steiner 1991).\n\nSmorynski (1977)\n has argued that already the first incompleteness theorem defeats\nHilbert\u2019s Program. Hilbert\u2019s aim was not merely to show\nthat formalized mathematics is consistent, but to do so in a specific\nway by showing that ideal mathematics can never lead to conclusions\nnot in accord with real mathematics. Thus, to succeed, ideal\nmathematics must be conservative over the real part: whenever\nformalized ideal mathematics proves a real formula \\(P, P\\) itself (or\nthe finitary proposition it expresses) must be finitarily provable.\nFor Smorynski the real formulas include not just numerical equalities\nand combinations thereof, but also general formulas with free\nvariables but without unbounded quantifiers.\n\nNow G\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem (G1) states that\nfor any sufficiently strong, consistent formal theory \\(S\\) there is a\nsentence \\(G_S\\) which is true but not derivable in \\(S\\). \\(G_S\\) is\na real sentence according to Smorynski\u2019s definition. Now\nconsider a theory \\(T\\) which formalizes ideal mathematics and its\nsubtheory \\(S\\) which formalizes real mathematics. \\(S\\) satisfies the\nconditions of G1 and hence \\(S\\) does not derive \\(G_S\\). Yet, \\(T\\),\nbeing a formalization of all of mathematics (including what is\nrequired to see that \\(G_S\\) is true), does derive \\(G_S\\). Hence, we\nhave a real statement which is provable in ideal mathematics and not\nin real mathematics.\n\nDetlefsen\n (1986,\n Appendix; see also\n 1990)\n has defended Hilbert\u2019s Program against this argument as well.\nDetlefsen argues that \u201cHilbertian\u201d instrumentalism escapes\nthe argument from G1 by denying that ideal mathematics must be\nconservative over the real part; all that is required is\nreal-soundness. Hilbertian instrumentalism requires only that the\nideal theory not prove anything which is in conflict with the real\ntheory; it is not required that it prove only real statements\nwhich the real theory also proves.\n\nFranks (2009)\n has provided a related defense and re-evaluation of Hilbert\u2019s\nproject, and\n McCarthy (2016)\n an alternative approach to the provability of consistency and G2 due\nto G\u00f6del himself.\n Kripke (forthcoming)\n shows how Hilbert\u2019s own approach to consistency proofs\nnaturally lead to G\u00f6delian incompleteness.\n Santos et al. (forthcoming),\n expanding on work by\n Artemov (2020),\n argue that a \u201cpartial finitism\u201d allows for consistency\nproofs compatible with G2, and is in line with Hilbert\u2019s own\npost-G\u00f6delian views. See also\n Schirn and Niebergall (2001)\n and\n Schirn (2019) for\n related proposals.\n Zach (2004)\n provides historical detail on the issue of conservativity and\nconsistency in Hilbert\u2019s program. See the entries on\n G\u00f6del\n and\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem,\n as well as\n Cheng (2021),\n for further discussion on G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems and consistency\nproofs.\n",
