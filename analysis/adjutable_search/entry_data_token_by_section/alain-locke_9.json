Conversely, pressure acculturation and the mass\ntransplanting of culture, the stock procedure of groups with\ntraditions of culture \u2018superiority\u2019 and dominance, are\ncounterindicated as against both the interests of cultural efficiency\nand the natural trends of culture selectivity. (CRIP 73)\n\n\nAll value-types are independent of any given value-content; any given\nvalue-type can be joined with any value-content. This fact of\nvaluation is what grounds cross-cultural transformation. The extent to\nwhich cultures are modified by their interactions with other cultures,\nis in part a function of how stringently the cultures in question\nassociate their own value-forms with specific value-content. At a\nhigher level, Locke indicates that associations might even be made\nbetween a value and its institutional form, by which he seems to mean\nthe manner in which the value is organized into the social structure\nof a value community. If specific values are correlated with\nparticular institutional forms, a necessary connection may be assumed\nto exist between them where it does not.\n",
