Gentzen\u2019s Consistency Proof \n\nCut elimination fails for first-order arithmetic (i.e.,\nPA), not even partial cut elimination is possible\nsince the induction axioms have unbounded complexity. Gentzen,\nhowever, found an ingenious way of dealing with purported\ncontradictions in arithmetic. In Gentzen 1938b he showed how to effectively\ntransform an alleged PA-proof of an inconsistency\n(the empty sequent) in his sequent calculus into another proof of the\nempty sequent such that the latter gets assigned a smaller ordinal\nthan the former. Ordinals are a central concept in set theory as well\nas in proof theory. To present Gentzen\u2019s work we shall first\ndiscuss the notion of ordinal from a proof-theoretic point of\nview.\n",
