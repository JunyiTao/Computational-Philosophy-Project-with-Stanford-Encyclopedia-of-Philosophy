    "main_text": "Naked Statistical Evidence\n6. Naked Statistical Evidence\n\nThe puzzles of naked statistical evidence consist of hypothetical\nscenarios in which the probability of the defendant\u2019s civil or\ncriminal liability, given the evidence, is above the requisite\nthreshold. Yet many have the intuition that the defendant should not\nbe found liable. The question is how to justify this intuition despite\nthe fact that the probability of liability meets the threshold. The\npuzzles of naked statistical evidence concern the question of\nsufficiency, namely, whether a body of evidence is enough to\nmeet the proof standard applicable in a case. They are not about\nwhether some evidence should be admissible at trial (on the\ndistinction, see Picinali 2016).\n",
