    "main_text": "Judgment and Propositions\n5. Judgment and Propositions\n\nThe mental act of judging includes both affirming one idea agrees with\nanother and denying such agreement. In affirmation, the result is a\njoining of the ideas; they are judged to agree with each other. In\ndenial, the result is a separation of the ideas; they are judged to be\n\u201crepugnant\u201d to each other. \u201cAgreement\u201d and\n\u201crepugnance\u201d are unpacked in terms of the crucial notions\nof comprehension and extension. When one judges that \u201cs\nis P\u201d, affirms that the comprehension of s\nincludes the comprehension of P and that s is\nincluded in the extension of P. Because ideas are\ncharacterized by their objects, a judgment is true when the ideas are\nrelated as the objects are related. As usual, this works\nstraightforwardly only when the ideas are sufficiently clear and\ndistinct. If one\u2019s idea of Arnauld confusedly contains the\nattribute of being married, then one might erroneously judge that the\nidea of Arnauld agrees with the idea of being married.\n\nJudgments are also called propositions, so propositions are mental\nentities. The priority of thought to language thus includes the point\nthat linguistic expressions of mental propositions are propositions in\na derivative, verbal sense. Verbal propositions are usually simply\ncalled \u201cpropositions\u201d and the reader is expected to sort\nthis out by context. Additionally supposing that the reader will not\nforget the distinction between thought and language, the authors use\nthe terms \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cpredicate\u201d to refer\nboth to the ideas making up a judgment and to the linguistic\nexpressions of the subject and predicate ideas. Because every simple\njudgment is composed of a subject idea and a predicate idea that are\nrelated by an act of affirmation or denial, the subject and predicate\nideas are expressed linguistically in the simplest case by a proper or\nsubstantive noun and a common noun or adjective. The affirmation is\nexpressed by a verb; expressions of denial add a negative word (II.3,\n82\u20133). Arnauld and Nicole criticize Aristotle and other\nphilosophers who combine the copula with features of the predicate\n(time) and subject (person); in a language mirroring Cartesian\nthought, there would be only one substantive verb, namely\nto be. In fact, natural languages often combine the predicate\nwith the verb, as in \u201cPeter lives\u201d, and Latin verbs\nsometimes express all three elements of judgment in one word, as in\ncogito and sum. Such verbs as \u201clives\u201d\ncan always be expressed with verb phrases including \u201cis\u201d\nand a noun phrase. The proposition \u201cPeter lives\u201d for\nexample, can be linguistically rendered as \u201cPeter is\nliving.\u201d\n\nThe doctrine that judgment arises exclusively from mental acts of\naffirmation and denial raises some important philosophical questions.\nFirst, if it is an act of affirmation or denial that\nresults in a proposition, there seems to be no room for doubting or\nsuspending judgment on a proposition. The Logic proposes a\n\u201cone act\u201d theory of affirmation and denial. Another kind\nof theory would require two acts: first, the formulation of a\njudgment, and second, affirming or denying it. In much post-Fregean\nphilosophy it is a requirement that propositions can be thought\nwithout asserting them and that mental \u201cattitudes\u201d such as\nbelieving, hoping, fearing, etc. can be taken regarding a proposition\nthat is neither affirmed nor denied.\n\nIn the Logic, however, things are different because of the\noft-cited sense in which thought is prior to language. Well formulated\nmental propositions can, in principle, be thought wordlessly\u2014a\nlinguistic sentence will rarely mirror the form of a thought with\nperfect accuracy. This means that to affirm a verbal proposition is\nnot always to have a clear and distinct perception of it. In a\ngenerally Cartesian theory of the mind, what is plausibly called\n\u201centertaining\u201d or \u201csuspending judgment\u201d on a\nproposition does not require a mental act apart from affirming or\ndenying. Suppose one thinks the proposition,\nP, but simultaneously thinks much more\nclearly the proposition, \u201cI should investigate the truth of\nP\u201d, or the proposition\nQ where Q is\nincompatible withP. Those states of mind\nseems to answer at least as well to the description \u201cmerely\nentertaining P\u201d as does a special\nmental act of entertaining or \u201csuspending judgment\non\u201d P. The authors could even claim\nthat one never does merely entertain a proposition\nP without the further concomitant judgment\nthat P is to some extent doubtful, or that\nit would be rash to act on P without further\ninvestigating whether P is true, etc.\n\nA second set of related questions is raised by the treatment of\nlogical operations in modern quantificational logic.\n\n\nIndeed, a loose chronicle of the role of the proposition in modern\nphilosophy runs as follows: Most of the important Early Moderns\nconflated the formation of a thought that has propositional content\nwith endorsement of that content and simply failed to see the\ndisastrous logical and epistemological implications of this\nconflation. Part of Frege\u2019s genius, the story goes, was to see\nthrough this mess and clearly distinguish propositional content from\njudgment from assertoric force. (Maru\u0161i\u0107 2014: 255)\n\n\nComplex propositions are subject to a generalized version of what is\nnow called the Frege-Geach problem. In a conditional proposition, for\nexample, it might seem that one could affirm the conditional without\nseparately affirming its components. But in the Logic, the\npropositions constituting the antecedent and consequent are formed by\nan act of affirmation (or denial). The proposition, \u201cIf the\nEarth is flat, then astronomy needs revision\u201d should be\naffirmable without one\u2019s accepting the antecedent as true, i.e.,\nwithout affirming it.\n\nThe authors take no notice of this problem and do not directly address\nit. When discussing complex propositions, the Logic shifts\nfrom explicit considerations of comprehension and extension to truth\nconditions. A conditional is false when the antecedent is true and the\nconsequent false and true when both are true; a conjunction is true\nwhen both conjuncts are true and false otherwise, and so on in the\nfamiliar way. Regarding conditional propositions, the Logic\nadditionally relates them to inferences. To think \u201cIf\nP then Q\u201d is\nto think of deducing the consequent from the antecedent (II.9, 100).\nFrom the perspective of Kant (for example), these problems stem from\nsupposing that mental propositions are formed by merely combining or\n\u201cfusing\u201d elements together. If conditionalizing,\ndisjoining, predicating, etc. are taken to be mental operations\ndistinct from affirmation and denial, a closer connection between\nmental and verbal propositions becomes possible (see Section 1 of\n Kant\u2019s theory of judgment).\n\nA different device comes into play for modal judgments of possibility\nand necessity (II.8). Verbal propositions including modal terms such\nas \u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d express mental\npropositions in which the basic acts of affirmation and denial are\nmodified. The ideas entering into modal propositions are not\nthemselves modified (Van der Scharr 2008: 334\u2013335;\nMaru\u0161i\u0107 2014: 277\u2013278). The authors label such acts\n\u201ctacit\u201d or \u201cvirtual\u201d affirmations (II.7, 93).\nIt seems open to the authors to regard such complex thoughts as\nconditionals, conjunctions, and disjunctions as similarly involving\nmodified affirmations, but they do not explicitly endorse this\nstrategy.\n\nNegation also raises interesting questions for the theory in the\nLogic. The act of denial extends to the entire judgment; this\nis expressed by the linguistic \u201cnot\u201d attaching to the\nverb. As Frege points out in his essay \u201cNegation\u201d (1918),\nthis account does not neatly fit with the requirement that a false\nthought be recognized as false. It seems that propositions must be\naffirmed (as true) or denied (as a true negation). For example, to\nrecognize that \u201c3 is greater than 5\u201d is false requires\nhaving a complete thought, and not merely fragments of a thought.\nSimilarly, there seems to be no room for true thoughts that have false\nthoughts as their components, such as true conditionals with false\nantecedents. In addition, the Logic seems to have trouble\nwith double negation. If denying separates the thought into its parts,\nthen double negation would function as a sword that magically unites\nthe parts it had sundered (Frege 1918 [1952: 122\u2013129]). From a\nmodern perspective, the root problem in treating negation as denial is\nonce again the failure to distinguish the thought or proposition that\nis grasped from the act of judging it.\n\nFrege\u2019s problems here stem from his requirement that the\nstructure of thought conform perfectly with a notation for expressing\nthe thought. The Logic \u201cpsychologistically\u201d\nprioritizes the theory of thought over the theory of symbolization. If\nthe authors had faced Frege\u2019s objections, they could have\ninsisted on inherent limitations in verbal expressions of thought.\nWhen one clearly and distinctly perceives that \u201c5 is greater\nthan 3\u201d it is always affirmed. It is psychologically impossible\nto affirm \u201c3 is greater than 5\u201d unless the ideas are badly\nconfused. If someone were to verbally assert \u201c3 is greater than\n5\u201d, it would be a mystery what they were thinking\nunless it was a proposition about the words. Asserting a well-formed\nverbal expression corresponds to a well-formed thought only insofar as\nthe thought is clear and distinct. Double negations are common in\ncomplex verbal propositions, but the Logic is not committed\nto these words signifying iterated \u201cseparations\u201d that\nresult in rejoinings. They can simply stand for affirmations. This\nmeans that when denial is described as \u201cseparating\u201d ideas,\nthat should be understood metaphorically. Denial in the Logic\nis perhaps better described as the recognition that the idea of the\npredicate is not among those included in the comprehension of the idea\nof the subject. And as usual, thoughts that are confused need to be\nsorted out before they can be precisely expressed. The same holds for\ntriple negations and denials. (For a further discussion, see section\n2.7.1 of the entry on\n Frege.)\n\nThe Logic\u2019s view of proposition formation also suggests\na problem for embedded generality (Buroker 1994). Subordinate clauses\nmust be located in either the subject or the predicate. But some\nembedded clauses make assertions and some do not. Despite the two\nverbs in the complex proposition \u201cMen who are pious are\ncharitable\u201d, for example, it is clear that one is not affirming\nof all men or even some men that they are pious. On the other hand,\n\u201cGod who is invisible created the world which is visible\u201d\npermits three assertions, \u201cGod is invisible\u201d, \u201cThe\nworld is visible\u201d, and \u201cGod created the world\u201d\n(II.5, 87). The Logic explains the difference between these\ntwo kinds of embedding in terms of \u201cdeterminative\u201d and\n\u201cexplicative\u201d subordinate clauses (or, as they say,\nrelative pronouns, see II.6\u20138). Determinative subordinate\nclauses restrict the signification of the antecedent of the relative\npronoun (e.g., \u201cmen who are pious\u201d) whereas explicative\nclauses do not (e.g., \u201cGod who is invisible\u201d). In fact\nboth determinations and explications can be carried out as well\nwithout embedded or subordinate clauses, as in the sentences\n\u201cPious men are charitable\u201d and \u201cThe invisible God\ncreated the visible world.\u201d When working these cases out, as\nusual in the Logic,\n\n\nit is often necessary to pay more attention to the meaning and the\nspeaker\u2019s intention than to the expression alone. (II.6, 90)\n\n\nPart II on judgment concludes in Chapters 17\u201320 with rules for\nthe conversion of verbal propositions, which is the exchanging of\nsubject and predicate terms. These operations on propositions are the\nLogic\u2019s reworking of the traditional theory of the\ndistribution of terms which in turn depended on a complicated theory\nof \u201csupposition\u201d (Spade 1982, Parsons 2006, Martin 2020).\nIn traditional logic, elaborate rules of conversion were necessary to\nrelate the premises of a syllogism to each other and to the\nconclusion. This is mostly unnecessary in the Logic\u2019s\ntreatment of syllogistic inference in Part III, but the authors take\nthe opportunity to display simplified conversion rules developed on\nthe basis of a few \u201caxioms\u201d regarding the containment\nrelationships between the comprehensions and extensions of terms.\n",
