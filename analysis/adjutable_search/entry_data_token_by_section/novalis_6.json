    "main_text": "Political Thought\n7. Political Thought\n\nIf there is a relative distinction between poetry and philosophy in\nNovalis\u2019s work\u2014the two need one another, yet answer to\ndifferent human needs and capacities\u2014the situation is more\ncomplicated with regard to art and politics. From Heinrich Heine\nonwards, the aestheticization of politics has been one of the\nstrongest cards played out by the critics of romantic philosophy. And\neven among the most sympathetic readers of Novalis\u2019s work, the\nliberally minded will have a hard time swallowing his attempt to\ncreate a higher union between politics, art, and religion, and his\ntendency to valorize religion over philosophy and art. The same\napplies for the way in which he, for example in a lyrical work such as\n\u201cHymns to the Night,\u201d written in response to the death of\nhis young fianc\u00e9e, infuses the erotic yearning for the beloved with a\nlonging for religious redemption. That said, Novalis\u2019s political\nthinking neither can nor should be reduced to these potentially\nreactionary sentiments. Novalis\u2019s idea of a synthesis of art and\npolitics is far more complex than is typically acknowledged by its\ncritics.\n\nWhile Novalis was always sympathetic to the ideals of the French\nrevolution, he grew increasingly skeptical in his assessment of their\nactual realization in late eighteenth-century France. In his view, the\nproponents of libert\u00e9, egalit\u00e9, and\nfraternit\u00e9 had failed to live up to their celebrated ideals.\nFor all its good intentions, the revolution had resulted in\ninequality, injustice, and terror. It is characteristic of\nNovalis\u2019s political philosophy that he not only offers a\nprincipled discussion of this predicament, but also a historical\ncritique. Novalis sees the revolution in continuity with the\nEnlightenment, and worries that these movements cultivate a notion of\nreason that fails to take historical reality into account. The\nproponents of the revolution had forgotten to ask if the people were\nready to take on the admirable ideals of liberty, equality, and\nsolidarity. Novalis wishes not only to endorse the ideals of the\nrevolution, but also to offer reflections on how the people can be\nbrought to a stage where they can responsibly take on the principles\nof the revolution and make its ideals their own. This is the ultimate\ntask and purpose of Bildung.\n\nThe first political pamphlet of the romantic movement was\nSchleiermacher\u2019s On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured\nDespisers, and Novalis is thoroughly influenced by this work. In\nOn Religion, Schleiermacher advocates an egalitarian,\norganic, and ecumenical religion, and professes that only such a\nreligious-political system can provide a framework within which the\nindividual can fully grow into and take responsibility for itself. At\nthe same time, such a religion is only possible\u2014it can only be\nrealized in concreto\u2014when the individuals of a given\nsociety have generally reached at least a minimal stage of\nself-understanding and respect for others. Hence there is a close\nconnection between the existence of a broad-spanning group of educated\nand mature individuals and the possibility of introducing a sensible\nreligious and ultimately also political order. The problem, according\nto Schleiermacher, is that modern religion has been dominated by\nphilistines who have placed themselves in between the people and the\ntrue democratic truths of the New Testament. What is needed is a\nrethinking of religious life\u2014and, as part of this, a rethinking\nof the relationship to tradition. This is why On Religion\nanticipates Schleiermacher\u2019s later writings in hermeneutics. And\nthis point, as it is appropriated by Novalis, also establishes a\nconnection between his hermeneutic historicism and his political\nphilosophy.\n\nNovalis\u2019s political reflections inform the Miscellaneous\nObservations, get more poignantly voiced in Faith and\nLove and the \u201cPolitical Aphorisms\u201d (written in 1798),\nand find their quasi-religious culmination in Christianity or\nEurope, the 1799-text that even his Athenaeum friends\ndeemed problematic in its call for a new Catholic unity in Europe. In\nspite of Schlegel\u2019s willingness to publish the text, the furore\nit caused amongst Novalis\u2019s peers, including Goethe, Schelling,\nand Schiller, held him back, and Christianity or Europe\nremained unpublished till 1826.\n\nThere is an overall unity in Novalis\u2019s political writings, as\nthey span almost the entire ten years of his productive period: the\nidea that democracy can only be effectively realized among a people\nthat is historically ready for it, that such readiness takes a\ncapacity for critique and independent thinking, and that\nBildung is the way in which independent thinking is best\nachieved. In combining critical skills, analytic abilities, and the\nmotivational force provided by art and cultured discourse, Novalis is\nhopeful that romantic philosophy will find a way to retain the ideals\nof the revolution without, at the same time, repeating its\nmistakes.\n\nRomanticism, in his view, aims at preserving the enlightenment\ncommitment to self-determination and freedom without turning it into a\nmerely abstract and alienating discourse. Individuality and\nself-determination can only be achieved in organic communion with\nother self-determining individuals. It needs to be realized as part of\nan ongoing discussion of the ultimate meaning, goals, and\nself-understanding of a given, historical society. A healthy\nintersubjectivity makes up a presupposition for a mature and\nwell-developed personality. Conversely, the organically developed\ncommunity consists of unique, yet mutually recognizing individuals and\ntheir bonds of interaction. Diversity is a condition for the sought\nunity. As such, the ideal society is likened to a work of art. No\nmechanical rules or abstract theories can guarantee the successful\nrealization of the community as a unity in manifold. This is the\nlesson Novalis takes from Schleiermacher, and which serves as the\ndetermining ground for his political theory. This is also the thought\nthat undergirds his lasting commitment to republicanism.\n\nIn the period between Faith and Love and Christianity or\nEurope, written only two years before Novalis\u2019s death,\nthere is a significant change in Novalis\u2019s views on how a good\nsociety is best achieved. In 1798 Novalis was inspired by the idea of\na democracy from above and connected the idea of education to the\nmotivational force of monarchy. By positing their own lives and\nactions as examples, the king and the queen, representing at one and\nthe same time the community of living individuals and the larger whole\nof the tradition, should inspire the people to strive for\nself-understanding and freedom through education. That is, by setting\nan example of autonomous thinking while, all the same, representing a\ncontinuity with the past, the royal couple would turn the monarchy\ninto a symbol of the democratic state itself. Around 1799, however,\nNovalis\u2019s view changes. He now imagines that this motivational\nforce can only be led back to the unifying power of the church, or,\nmore precisely, that of the papal state. At this point, the democratic\nethos of his thinking is considerably weakened.\n\nNovalis\u2019s turn to the church is indisputably problematic when\njudged from a 21st century perspective. Yet it is important to see\nthat within his own time, most of his political writing, up until\naround 1798, is representative of the progressive reformist movement\nin Germany. Furthermore, Novalis\u2019s democratic, pluralistic, and\negalitarian ideals should not be dismissed because of his later, more\nconservative sentiments, nor should the connection he sees between\nthese ideals and a commitment to Bildung. It is this notion\nof Bildung, the idea that democracy requires a triad of\nindividual education, societal plurality, and, not least, a capacity\nfor impartial judging, that will remain Novalis\u2019s most valuable\ncontribution to political thought.\n",
