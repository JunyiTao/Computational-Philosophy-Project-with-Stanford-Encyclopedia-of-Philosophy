Surprisingly, this\nassumption does not rule out strategic voting. To the contrary, voters\nmay vote against what they believe to be correct in order to\nfacilitate a correct aggregate decision.\n\nThis can be called epistemic-strategic voting, because voters\nstrategise out of a shared epistemic objective rather than conflicting\ninterests. How is this even possible? Suppose a 9-member jury reaches\na guilty-or-innocent verdict by majority. A juror reasons:\n\n\nI believe in guilt. My vote only makes a difference if it is pivotal,\ni.e., if my jury colleagues are split 4:4. So, let me assume this\nsplit. But then four (competent) colleagues believe in innocence. So\ninnocence is more likely than I thought. The higher probability of\ninnocence justifies an \u201cinnocent\u201d verdict. So I shall vote\ninnocent.\n\n\nShe votes on the basis, not of her beliefs, but her conditional\nbeliefs assuming pivotality. If everyone reasons alike, no one reveals\ntheir genuine judgment. Votes reflect no private information or\ninsights, and collective decision are arbitrary. Defendants are\nunanimously acquitted even when everyone believes in guilt.\n\nFortunately, this absurd situation is no more stable than sincere\nvoting. Why? The strategic reasoning leading to non-sincere voting\ncannot be universalised: it assumes others vote sincerely. Indeed, our\nexample juror assumes her colleagues are sincere in her \u201cBut\nthen\u201d inference.\n\nEpistemic-strategic voting has been addressed game-theoretically,\nusing jury models enriched by voters\u2019 private information; see\nAusten-Smith and Banks (1996), Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1999), Peleg\nand Zamir (2012), Bozbay, Dietrich, and Peters (2014), and many\nothers. The generic finding is that sincere voting by everyone is no\n(Nash) equilibrium, but that the rationality of sincere voting can be\nrestored by carefully adjusting the aggregation rule, raising a\nproblem of procedure (\u201cmechanism\u201d) design rather than\ngroup\n design.[20]\n\nBut is epistemic-strategic reasoning and voting really plausible?\nThere are three very different objections. Firstly, voters may be\nboundedly rational and unable (or unwilling) to strategise. Secondly,\nvariations of the decision procedure, possibly introducing pre-voting\ndeliberation can make strategic voting less likely (e.g., Coughlan\n2000; Gerardi & Yariv 2007). Thirdly, and most interestingly,\nsincere voting becomes perfectly rational under a richer and arguably\nmore realistic picture of voter motivation, where the narrowly\nconsequentialist concern for correct collective outcomes is replaced\nor complemented by a concern about the act of voting itself, often an\nintrinsic concern for being sincere, or for expressing one\u2019s\nopinion, or for complying with norms of sincerity. The literature\ncontrasts instrumental and expressive voting (Brennan & Lomasky\n1993; Schuessler 2000). Why do expressive concerns (even if just\nsmall) easily crowd out instrumental concerns, so that sincerity\nbecomes rational? The reason is that, in sufficiently large groups,\nthe probability of being pivotal, i.e., of affecting the outcome, is\nsmall, so that the instrumental concern almost cancels out when\nsolving the voter\u2019s optimisation problem. So, strategic voting\nmay well be a game-theoretic artifact of ascribing purely instrumental\npreferences to voters.\n",
