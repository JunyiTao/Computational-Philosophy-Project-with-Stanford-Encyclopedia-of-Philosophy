    "main_text": "Interpretative Studies: Gestalten und Kreise\n8. Interpretative Studies: Gestalten und Kreise\n\nIn 1954, Susman published a collection of essays she had written in\nthe period from 1921 to 1953. The anthology, titled Gestalten und\nKreise (Figures and Circles), features interpretative\nstudies on Jewish authors such as Moses Mendelssohn, Freud, Bergson,\nFranz Rosenzweig, Franz Kafka, and Karl Wolfskehl. The volume also\nincluded studies on other authors, such as Goethe and Nietzsche, as\nwell as essays on Chassidism, Women\u2019s Emancipation, and\nAnarchism. The essays exemplify Susman\u2019s approach to doing\nphilosophy, or her way of working, philosophically, by means of\nexploring the paradigmatic significance of historical constellations.\nHer method is a kind of deep reading focusing on how authors and their\ntexts negotiate the challenges of the historical moment in which they\nlive and write, and which they have come to exemplify. The book as a\nwhole, Susman notes in her preface, is \u201can attempt to offer with\nthe demise of an old world an entry point to a new one\u201d (GK\n5).\n\nUnlike Dilthey\u2014Simmel\u2019s \u201cantipode\u201d (Ich\nhabe viele Leben gelebt, 1964: 65)\u2014Susman stays close to\nSimmel in interpreting individuals and intellectual movements in their\nhistorical context. While Susman feels historical configurations\ndeserve our utmost appreciation, she does not take them to exude the\nkind of normative validity that Dilthey\u2019s approach suggests they\ndo. For her, \u201cthe act of understanding is itself temporal,\nhistorical\u201d; the\n\n\nunity it creates is nothing more than the life of an ephemeral moment.\nAnd yet, all our truth and the entire relationship of our time to our\neternity rests on this moment. (AW 352)\n\n\nInformed by an approach to death that resonates with\nRosenzweig\u2019s Star of Redemption, Simmel\u2019s\nLebensanschauung (Views of Life 1918), and Heidegger\u2019s\nBeing and Time (whose approach considering death initially\ntakes its cue from Simmel), Susman views human mortality as that which\ninforms human sense-making, which, as a project, is defined by its own\ntemporality (AW 352 and 336\u201338). Her approach dovetails here\nwith Rosenzweig, whose thought limns death as the marker of the\nfinitude that enables human existence\u2019s forward-looking\nviewpoint \u201cinto life\u201d (Ins Leben, the concluding\ntwo words of Rosenzweig\u2019s Star of Redemption). This\nforward-looking perspective oriented towards life that takes death as\nlife\u2019s point of departure rather than its end allows for an\nunderstanding of temporality and meaning pointedly opposed to the\norientation towards death guiding Heidegger (\u201cFranz\nRosenzweig\u201d, 1930 [GK 297\u201398]).\n\nSusman first highlighted the significance and innovative impetus of\nRosenzweig\u2019s Star of Redemption in a review essay\nentitled \u201cDer Exodus aus der Philosophie\u201d (\u201cThe\nExodus from Philosophy\u201d) that appeared only months after the\nbook\u2019s publication. A month later, in a review of the book\npublished in Der Jude (1922), she offered a more detailed\ndiscussion, which led to Rosenzweig\u2019s enthusiastic response\n (quoted above in Section 1).\n Nine years later, in the wake of Rosenzweig\u2019s death, Susman\ngave the first comprehensive account of Rosenzweig\u2019s\nintellectual legacy (\u201cFranz Rosenzweig\u201d, 1930). Over two\ndecades later, in Gestalten und Kreise, she revisited\nRosenzweig\u2019s life and thought as one of the great testimonies of\nJewish history (GK 311). For Susman, Rosenzweig\u2019s magnum opus is\nan avowal or profession (Bekenntnis, GK 296); it is more than\nmere knowledge (Erkenntnis). For Rosenzweig, the question of\nphilosophy is no longer \u201cwhat is?\u201d but is instead that of\nthe \u201cwhole, living and dying human\u201d whose concern is:\n\u201cWhere is a truth that can redeem me?\u201d (GK 298). The\nconsternation this book produced was based, Susman observed, on the\nradical turn in thinking caused by the thinker\u2019s return or\nteshuva (Umkehr, GK 302). It is the particular and\ncreative combination of Jewish and German thought that gives rise to a\nnew thinking that reimagines the project of philosophy at the\ninterface of faith and knowledge as a task committed to attending to\nthe existential exigencies of life.\n\n\u201cMoses Mendelssohn and His Decision\u201d first appeared in\n1932; it appeared in revised form in 1946. Both dates indicate\nhistorical watersheds bookending the beginning and end of Nazi\npersecution and the demise of Jewish life in central Europe, along\nwith the end of the prolific period of German Jewish culture that had\nbegun with Mendelssohn,\n\n\nthe beginning of the famous salons of the Romantic period\u2014and\nhence the beginning of German intellectual sociability in general. (GK\n269)\n\n\nMore than his writing, Susman suggests, Mendelssohn\u2019s life\nexemplified the decision to embrace German culture and the project of\nEnlightenment in whose creation he played a crucial role. By embracing\nmodernity while solidly grounded in the Jewish tradition (whose first\nmodern representative he would become), he courageously set out to\njustify his commitment to both as a choice. Mendelssohn\u2019s\ndecision to live as a modern individual who celebrates Judaism by\nchoice answered Lavater\u2019s challenge to explain how he could\nremain Jewish and at the same time be a modern citizen of the world.\nMendelssohn\u2019s decision, however, put the burden on the\nindividual to justify adherence to Judaism in terms of an individual\nchoice rather than by belonging to the communal reality of a people.\nIn the wake of the Shoah, Mendelssohn may thus only appear as a figure\nof a world that has come to its tragic end. However, Susman argues,\nMendelssohn\u2019s choice is a vision that points beyond what, in the\nmiddle of the twentieth century, could only be seen as a cataclysmic\nend. Challenging hindsight analyses that cast Mendelssohn\u2019s\ntrajectory as opportunistically reformist at best and a calamitous\nbetrayal of Jewish tradition at worst, Susman instead highlights how\nMendelssohn\u2019s predicament ultimately represents and adumbrates\nthe challenges each Jew continues to face today.\n\nGestalten und Kreise concludes with a lightly edited version\nof \u201cDas Hiob-Problem bei Franz Kafka\u201d (\u201cThe Problem\nof Job in Franz Kafka\u201d, 1929), the first Kafka interpretation\nattending to the role of Jewish tradition in his writing.\n\n\nThis is in what consists the so strange, so profoundly religiously\nharrowing of Kafka\u2019s world removed from God: this world is not\nseen from the perspective of the world, from life, it is seen from the\nperspective of God, the law, measured and judged according to it.\n[\u2026] The presentation of his God-forsaken world, immersed into\nnothing in its whole painful and sinister truth is ultimately nothing\nelse but the presentation of his messianic longing. (GK 364;\ntranslated RPE 69)\n\n\nBenjamin and Scholem\u2019s Kafka interpretations follow\nSusman\u2019s discussion in often quasi-verbatim ways. The concluding\naphorism of Adorno\u2019s Minima Moralia (1951, itself\nmodelled on Adorno\u2019s reading of Kafka) bears a striking\nresemblance to the epistemologically critical gesture that informs\nSusman\u2019s Kafka interpretation.\n\nWhile universal in outlook and range, Gestalten und Kreise\ncarries a distinctly Jewish note that underscores the\ninterconnectedness of philosophical and Jewish themes in\nSusman\u2019s approach.\n\nEmbracing interpretation as sense-making, Susman practices an\nexplicitly receptive, dialogical form of doing philosophy and writing;\nher writing, for instance, negotiates the relationship between the\nuniversal and particular through its performative dimensions as it\nproceeds. Making this receptivity a generative feature of her writing\nand thinking, Gestalten und Kreise exemplifies this\nparticular mode of Susman\u2019s writing, which might well be\nconsidered Susman\u2019s particular form of \u00e9criture\nf\u00e9minine.\n",
