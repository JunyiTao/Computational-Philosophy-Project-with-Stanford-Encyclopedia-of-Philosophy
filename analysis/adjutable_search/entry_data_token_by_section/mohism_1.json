    "main_text": "The Ten Mohist Doctrines\n2. The Ten Mohist Doctrines\n\n\nAs their movement developed, the Mohists came to present themselves as\noffering a collection of ten key doctrines, divided into five pairs.\nThe ten doctrines correspond to the titles of the\n ten triads,\n the ten sets of three essays\nthat form the core of the Mozi. Although the essays in each\ntriad differ in detail, the gist of each doctrine may be briefly\nsummarized as follows. \n\n\u201cPromoting the Worthy\u201d and \u201cIdentifying\nUpward.\u201d The purpose of government is to achieve a stable\nsocial, economic, and political order (zhi, pronounced \u201cjr\u201d)\nby promulgating a unified conception of morality (yi). This\ntask of moral education is to be carried out by encouraging everyone to\n\u201cidentify upward\u201d to the good example set by social and political\nsuperiors and by rewarding those who do so and punishing those who do\nnot. Government is to be structured as a centralized, bureaucratic\nstate led by a virtuous monarch and managed by a hierarchy of appointed\nofficials. Appointments are to be made on the basis of competence and\nmoral merit, without regard for candidates\u2019 social status or\norigins.\n\u201cInclusive Care\u201d and \u201cCondemning\nAggression.\u201d To achieve social order and exemplify the key\nvirtue of ren (benevolence, goodwill), people must inclusively\ncare for each other, having as much concern for others\u2019 lives,\nfamilies, and communities as for their own, and in their relations with\nothers seek to benefit them. Military aggression is wrong for the same\nreasons that theft, robbery, and murder are: it harms others in pursuit\nof selfish benefit, while ultimately failing to benefit Heaven, the\nspirits, or society as a whole.\n\u201cModeration in Use\u201d and \u201cModeration in\nBurial.\u201d To benefit society and care for the welfare of the\npeople, wasteful luxury and useless expenditures must be eliminated.\nSeeking always to bring wealth to the people and order to society, the\nren (benevolent) person avoids wasting resources on extravagant\nfunerals and prolonged mourning (customs promoted by the Ru and others).\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s Intent\u201d and \u201cUnderstanding\nGhosts.\u201d Heaven is the noblest, wisest moral agent, so its\nintent is a reliable, objective standard of what is morally righteous\n(yi) and must be respected. Heaven rewards those who obey its\nintent and punishes those who defy it, hence people should strive to\nbe benevolent and do what is righteous. Social and moral order (zhi)\ncan be advanced by encouraging belief in ghosts and spirits who reward\nthe good and punish the wicked.\n\u201cCondemning Music\u201d and \u201cCondemning\nFatalism.\u201d The benevolent (ren) person opposes the\nextravagant musical entertainment and other luxuries enjoyed by rulers\nand high officials, because these waste resources that could otherwise\nbe used for feeding and clothing the common people. Fatalism is not\nren, because by teaching that our lot in life is predestined\nand human effort is useless, it interferes with the pursuit of economic\nwealth, a large population, and social order (three primary goods that\nthe benevolent person desires for society). Fatalism fails to meet a series\nof justificatory criteria and so must be rejected.\n\n\n\nWhen an audience with the ruler of a state was secured, different\ndoctrines might be advocated first, depending on the circumstances in\nthat state:\nIf the state is in disorder, then expound \u201cpromoting the\nworthy\u201d and \u201cidentifying upward\u201d; if the state is poor, then expound\n\u201cmoderation in use\u201d and \u201cmoderation in burial\u201d; if the state\noverindulges in musical entertainment, then expound \u201ccondemning music\u201d\nand \u201ccondemning fate\u201d; if the state is dissolute and indecorous, expound\n\u201chonoring Heaven\u201d and \u201cserving ghosts\u201d; if the state is devoted to\naggression and intimidation, then expound \u201cinclusive care\u201d and\n\u201ccondemning aggression.\u201d (Book 49, \u201cQuestions of\n Lu\u201d).[3]\n\n\nAs this passage and the capsule summaries of their ten core\ndoctrines indicate, the Mohists saw themselves primarily as a moral,\npolitical, and religious advocacy group devoted to realizing what they\nsaw as a morally right society and way of life, one that promotes\n\u201cbenefit\u201d (l\u00ec) and eliminates \u201charm\u201d (hai) for\nall the world. \u201cBenefit\u201d (l\u00ec) for them is a loose\nconception of general welfare comprising material prosperity, an\nabundant population, and sociopolitical \u201corder\u201d (zhi). This\nlatter term denotes social conditions in which crime, deceit,\nharassment, strife, and military aggression are absent, people\ncooperate with and assist each other, those without family to support\nthem are cared for, and individuals manifest the virtues appropriate to\ntheir roles as rulers, subjects, fathers, sons, and brothers. The\nMohists\u2019\n ethical theory\n is an interesting,\ncomplex form of consequentialism that posits a plurality of intrinsic\ngoods, which are to be promoted through a variety of strategies.\n\n\nAside from their ethical and\n political doctrines\n \u2014 the aspects of their philosophy they themselves see as\ncentral \u2014 the Mohists\u2019 explicit theories and implicit assumptions\nabout language,\n knowledge,\n reasoning,\n and moral psychology are of great\nphilosophical interest. Many aspects of their views in these areas are\nprobably not distinctively Mohist, but instead reflect background\nassumptions widely shared by other classical Chinese thinkers. Thus a\ngreater understanding of Mohist thought advances our understanding of\nearly Confucianism, Daoism, and other schools as well.\n",
