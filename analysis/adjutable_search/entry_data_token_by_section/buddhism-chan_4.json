    "main_text": "Ethical Dimensions of Chan\n5. Ethical Dimensions of Chan\n\nFrom the perspective of Chan practice, the merits of cutting off\nconceptual craving and calculation are immediately evident. But\nclaiming no-thought and unquestioning participation as norms can be\nseen as promoting unreflective and potentially uncaring and unjust\nactions, as well as generating liabilities for authoritarian abuse.\nGiven that ethics seemingly requires reasoned reflection on how to\nrealize the good life as persons and as communities, is Chan finally\nun-ethical or anti-ethical? If there is really nothing to seek or\nattain, as so many Chan masters have averred, and if enlightenment is\nnot so much a substantive change as it is a gestalt shift, is this not\nto simply leave untreated and likely worsening all of the ills and\ninjustices plaguing us?\n\nThere is little in Chan literature that could plausibly warrant\npositioning Chan wholly within any one of the standard Western\ncategories of consequentialist, deontological and virtue ethics, or,\nfor that matter, within such alternatives as communitarian or care\nethics. Chan literature is notoriously silent about the kinds of\nquestions to which ethics typically offers answers. Indeed, the\nrecurrent valorizations of non-thinking (wunian), non-abiding\n(wuzhu, \u7121\u4f4f) and non-reliance (wuyi,\n\u7121\u4f9d) in the context of Chan\u2019s nondualistic\nmetaphysics and its idealization of responsive virtuosity suggest that\nif there is such a thing as Chan ethics it is an ethics of relational\nimprovisation.\n\nThe mainstream of Western ethics takes the individual, decision-making\nagent as the basic unit of concern, and a primary concern is to\ndevelop a universally applicable method of arbitrating among the often\ndisparate interests of individual agents, establishing\nrationally-guided means to determining and practically realizing the\nmeaning of the good life. Chan nonduality shifts concern from\nindividual agents to relationality, and in particular to the kind of\nrelationality that fully manifests our original Buddha-nature. In this\nsense, the basic method of Chan ethics might be thought to be\nemulation\u2014a method of deliberately acting as the Buddha did. But\nthis would imply a goal orientation that is entirely at odds with\nChan\u2019s cautions against objectifying enlightened/enlightening\nconduct or making Buddha-hood a goal or destination. As the example of\nJuzhi\u00a0and his attendant makes strikingly evident, the method of\nChan is not to imitate or mimic the behavior of either past or present\nexemplars. Rather, it is to exemplify ourselves the dramatic clarity\nand relational virtuosity of bodhisattvas who are able, in any\nsituation whatsoever to bring about a liberating inflection of ongoing\nrelational dynamics. If Chan ethics involves emulation, it is\nemulation of something like an improvisational style rather than\nmastery of a specific deliberative or behavioral repertoire.\n\nIt can be said, then, that freedom is a primary ethical value in Chan.\nBut Chan freedom is not identified with the exercise of control or\nchoice; neither is it rooted in rational determinations of whether a\ngiven course of action is good or will have good results. That is,\nfreedom is not associated with independence (which is imaginable only\nin ignorance of the interdependence and interpenetration of all\nthings), nor is it conceived essentially as a property of individual\nagency. In keeping with the bodhisattva ideal, freedom consists in\nembodying superlative capacities-for and\ncommitments-to realizing the conditions for relating\nfreely: the improvisational expression of relational\nvirtuosity oriented toward the resolution of conflict, trouble\nand suffering. Chan ethics is not a function of living in accord with\npredetermined means-to and meanings-of the good, but rather of\nimprovisational genius\u2014a creative marriage of fluid vigilance\nand unwavering care: an ethics of ever-intensifying appreciative and\ncontributory virtuosity.\n\nThis, of course, is a distillation of Chan ideals. Extant evidence is\nthat life within Chan monastic communities was conducted in adherence\nwith the disciplining precepts of Buddhist ordination, and that\ninteractions with the lay community were for the most part consistent\nwith prevailing moral and social norms. Chan rhetoric notwithstanding,\nChan practice seems to have been more norm-respecting rather than\nnorm-eliding. In keeping with this, when the famous Tang poet,\nBai\u00a0Juyi (772\u2013846) asked Chan master\nNiaoke\u00a0(741\u2013824) about the true meaning of Chan,\nNiaoke\u00a0responded, \u201cAs for doing evil, avoid it; as for the\ngood, practice sharing it\u201d. When Bai\u00a0Juyi derisively\ndismissed this as the kind of advice given to three-year-old children,\nNiaoke\u00a0didn\u2019t disagree, but simply added that although it\nwas advice that rolled easily off the tongue, it was also advice that\nmost eighty-year-olds failed to put into practice.\n\nYet, when Niaoke\u00a0extols sharing the good, he is not referring to\nsome fixed or predetermined ideal or attribute. Like the Sanskrit\nku\u015bala for which it served as a translation, the Chinese\nword he uses, shan (\u5584), connotes the superlative:\n\u201cgood\u201d in the sense of being expert or virtuosic.\nMoreover, he does not advocate \u201cbeing\u201d good or even\n\u201cdoing\u201d good, but rather sharing it. Chan ethics is thus\nnot a knowing-that something is or will be good, but rather\nknowing-how to extend the horizons of virtuosity in ways\ndeemed valuable by others (on this distinction, see Varela 1999). And\nthis knowing-how is not an intellectually-attained method, but rather\nthe result of embodied, relationship-attuning practice.\n\nWith this in mind, it is interesting to note that among its signal\nachievements Chan came to include the Chan Rules of Purity (Chan\njinggui), attributed to Baizhang (749\u2013814), which\nestablished a comprehensive code of conduct for Chan monastics. Even\nin the radical Hongzhou lineage, living in accordance with these rules\nwas seen as essential to holding open the circuit of mutual\ncontribution that made the privilege of monastic life possible.\nWeishan Lingyou (771\u2013853), for example, explicitly urges monks\nin his community gratefully and with a lofty and peaceful spirit to\nrepay the kindnesses of their parents, their donors, the emperor and\nthe Buddha, without whose offerings they would not have the\nopportunity to realize Chan awakening (Weishan jingce, T.\n48:1042b-43c), primarily by adhering to established rules of\ncomportment for those embracing the bodhisattva ideal. The emphasis on\nbodily comportment is crucial.\n\nAs the Pali and Sanskrit texts of the Vinaya division of the Buddhist\ncanon make clear, the norms of Buddhist monastic life were not arrived\nat in an a priori or purely rational fashion, but rather in\nsituated response to tensions arising within the early monastic\ncommunity and in its interactions with the rest of society. This\nsituational approach to the development of norms for conduct and\ndemeanor resonated well with indigenous Chinese approaches to ethics.\nThe moral and ethical norms of the Confucian tradition around which\nsocial relations have been structured throughout much of China\u2019s\nhistory do not consist in rationally-derived principles and virtues,\nbut rather in standards of ritual performance (li, \u79ae)\nwithin the roles\u2014as fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, friends\nand societal participants\u2014that are the constitutive means-to and\nmeanings-of being authentic and valued persons-in-community (see Ames\n2011). These standards are, of course, behavioral. They provide a\nsocial grammar to which recourse is made in shaping one\u2019s\nrelationships in meaningful and situationally appropriate ways. But\nmore importantly, these standards are also qualitative\u2014standards\nof intention, attitude and energy as they pertain to relational\nenhancement. Although any grammar is by nature restrictive, the\npurpose of Confucian norms is to provide a structure for the\nprogressive personification of consummate conduct (ren,\n\u4ec1). Ethics is ultimately inseparable from aesthetics.\n\nUnderstood in this context, monastic discipline provides a basic\ngrammar for living as persons-in-Buddhist-community. Abiding by\nmonastic rules of behavior and comportment are a kind of \u201cbasic\ntraining\u201d on the way of developing relational virtuosity. That\nsaid, Chan virtuosity involves much more than\n\u201cgrammatical\u201d proficiency. An intimation of what this\nmeans is presented in this beautifully crafted passage in the\ndiscourse records of Mazu.\n\n\nBuddhas are capable of authoritative personhood (ren). Having\nrealized kind wisdom and the excellent nature of opportunities and\ndangers, you can break through the net of doubts snaring all sentient\nbeings. Departing from \u201cis\u201d and \u201cis-not\u201d and\nother such bondages\u2026.leaping over quantity and calculation, you\nwill be without obstruction in whatever you do. When your situation\nand its pattern are penetrated, [your actions] are like the sky giving\nrise to clouds; suddenly they exist, and then they don\u2019t. Not\nleaving behind any obstructing traces, they are like phrases written\non water. (Xu zangjing, Vol. 119.406b)\n\n\nThe Chan ethical ideal is liberating intimacy and efficacy without\nagency.\n",
