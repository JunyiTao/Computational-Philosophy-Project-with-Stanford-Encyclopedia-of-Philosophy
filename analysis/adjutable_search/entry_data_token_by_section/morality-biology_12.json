    "main_text": "Evolutionary Biology and Normative Ethics: Prescriptive Evolutionary Ethics, Corrective Evolutionary Ethics, and the Question of Moral Progress || The Question of Moral Progress\n3.4 The Question of Moral Progress\n\nThe idea of moral progress features prominently in reflection on the\nhistory and future of moral thought and practice. While it may be\ndifficult to assess whether a society has made moral progress on\nthe whole over some period, it is not hard to find plausible\nexamples of progress along particular dimensions. The elimination of\nthe Atlantic slave trade, for example, and the development of the\nmodern human rights movement are compelling examples of widespread\nmoral progress. There are also plausible avenues to further\nprogress through improved conformity with legitimate moral norms\nand through improvements in moral concepts, reasoning, and\nunderstanding. We might then wonder: what are the drivers of such\nmoral progress (and likewise of moral regression when it occurs)? And\nhow might evolutionary biology bear on the prospects and strategies\nfor achieving moral progress (and avoiding moral regression)? Allen\nBuchanan and Russell Powell take up these issues in wide-ranging\ntheoretical work that potentially has practical implications for a\nnumber of current social and political problems, as discussed below\n(Buchanan and Powell 2018, 2019; Buchanan 2020; see also the symposium\ndiscussion of the 2018 book in Analyse & Kritik 41(2),\n2019).\n\nDifferent metaethical stances (see section 4) yield different\nunderstandings of what moral progress might consist in as well as\ndifferent explanations for how moral progress has historically come\nabout. A moral realist, for example, will tend to conceive of moral\nprogress in terms of achieving a more accurate grasp of objective\nmoral truths and refining of our practices and institutions to align\nmore closely with them; and plausible examples, such as the widespread\nliberalization of moral practices over the past few centuries, will be\nexplained largely by appeal to growing insight into moral truth\n(Huemer 2016). By contrast, those who reject such appeals to objective\nmoral truths but wish to retain some notion of moral progress (perhaps\none that is extensionally very similar) will formulate a different\nconception of progress and offer socio-cultural explanations of\nprogressive changes that do not rely on appeals to improved insights\ninto moral truth (Kitcher 2011). We will here set aside the many\ncomplex issues attending these different approaches and focus on\nthis question: what bearing might our evolutionary past have on our\nprospects and strategies for achieving the sorts of changes most agree\nwould constitute moral progress?\n\nSuppose that the trend toward greater inclusivity with respect to the\nscope of moral consideration\u2014i.e., the elimination of racial and\ngender barriers to the attribution of full human moral status, and the\nextension of substantial moral considerability to a wide range of\nnon-human animals\u2014counts as moral progress. One pessimistic\nthought that might arise here on the basis of evolutionary\nconsiderations is that human moral psychology may have evolved in such\na way as to place inevitable constraints on the possibilities for\nachieving robust and sustained progress in these respects. While our\nevolved moral psychology may contain certain altruistic elements,\nthese may be ultimately parochial, given the nature of the selection\npressures faced by our Pleistocene ancestors and assuming, as most\ndiscussions do, that the long Pleistocene Epoch (roughly 2.6 million\nyears ago to 11,700 years ago, is the one primarily relevant to the\nbiological evolution of human psychological\n traits).[11]\n That is, these elements may be focused on kin and members of a\nperceived in-group, with other countervailing dispositions posing\nstrong obstacles to extending that altruism to outside groups. Even if\nwe have some capacity for autonomous moral thought, enabling at least\nsome to grasp more inclusive moral truths, there may be such powerful\nevolutionary constraints built into human moral psychology that such\nideas are unlikely to take hold and motivate progressive changes in a\nwidespread and sustainable way. There may be evolutionary limits to\nthe basic moral progress that we evolved primates can realistically\nhope to achieve: we may just be saddled with a largely\nexclusivist, tribalist morality.\n\nBuchanan and Powell refer to this pessimistic idea as\n\u201cevoconservatism,\u201d and they note that it has been used\nto argue against social and political movements organized around such\n\u201ccosmopolitan moral reform.\u201d And on the other side of\nthat same evolutionary coin, \u201cevoliberals\u201d share the same\npremise about the constraints imposed by evolution on human moral\npsychology but instead argue that since the progressive goals are\nsufficiently desirable, we should look for biotechnological\ninterventions to alter human nature in such a way as to make them\nrealistically achievable. Buchanan and Powell reject both views\nbecause they reject the underlying picture of evolved human moral\nnature. Instead, they argue that the striking shifts that have already\noccurred toward more inclusive morality, as well as consideration of\nthe conditions under which moral regression has occurred, support a\nvery different, more nuanced picture of evolved human moral\npsychology\u2014one without such pessimistic implications for deep\nand lasting moral progress.\n\nOn their \u201cbiocultural\u201d view, it is not just that human\nrationality allows significant scope for autonomous moral reasoning\nthat can lead to greater inclusivity (as discussed in section 2.4\nabove), but that our evolved moral psychology itself contains the\nseeds for such a shift (though it equally contains the seeds for\npotential moral regression). They key idea is that our evolved moral\nnature is neither inherently tribalist nor inherently inclusivist, but\ncontains both dispositions; their expression, however,\nis conditional on the particular socio-institutional environmental\nconditions that obtain (or are at least perceived to obtain). In some\nconditions tribalistic dispositions will be engaged, while in other\nconditions inclusivist dispositions can dominate. This is their\n\u201cadaptive plasticity\u201d model of evolved human moral\npsychology, according to which evolution has disposed us to think and\nbehave in certain ways under one set of (perceived) conditions, and in\nvery different ways under another set of (perceived)\nconditions\u2014this having been fitness-enhancing in our\nevolutionary history. In particular, our tribalist tendencies are\nactivated when \u201ccues of out-group threat\u201d are perceived\n(whether real or not), involving competition, disease, undermining of\nin-group cohesion, and so on; by contrast, our inclusivist tendencies\nare activated when such cues are less abundant or salient.\n\nThe hypothesis is that these adaptively plastic traits served the\nbiological interests of Pleiostocene humans well, achieving the joint\nbenefits of tribalism under conditions where it was fitness-enhancing\nand more inclusive morality under conditions where tribalism was\ncounterproductive and greater inclusivity was beneficial. For us\ntoday, this constitutes a mixed inheritance: on the one hand, it\nprovides us with the seeds for moral progress insofar as we can foster\nand maintain the socio-institutional contexts that allow more\ninclusive dispositions to flourish; on the other hand, it saddles us\nwith vulnerability to destructive tribalism when we find ourselves (or\neven just perceive ourselves to be) in circumstances\ncharacterized by sufficient out-group threat cues. Buchanan and Powell\nargue that this makes human beings dangerously susceptible to moral\nregression due to the manipulation of perceptions through demagogic\npopulism, for example\u2014a danger that is exacerbated where\ndisinformation is rapidly spread through social media. If they are\nright, then the situation is ripe for media-savvy politicians to\nmanipulate popular beliefs in ways designed to trigger the threat cues\nthat energize tribalist tendencies in thought, feeling and behavior\nfor political gain\u2014from reflexive anti-immigrant nationalist\nsentiment to racially charged scapegoating during a pandemic.\n\nWhile these dangers cast doubt on the conviction that moral\nprogress is inevitable or even the natural default, the model proposed\nby Buchanan and Powell leaves open a realistic hope for continued and\ndeepening moral progress: it is possible for humanity to make and\nsustain deep moral progress, without being hamstrung by any inbuilt\nevolutionary constraints; but it will require ongoing cultural efforts\nto foster and sustain the socio-institutional circumstances that\nenable the better aspects of human moral nature to predominate\n(Buchanan, forthcoming). This is the practical message of this\nbiocultural theory of moral progress: moral progress is possible for\nus without the need for biotechnological modifications of human\nnature; but such progress is also fragile and cannot be taken for\ngranted (Buchanan and Powell 2018).\n",
