    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language || Early Contemporary Views\n3.1 Early Contemporary Views\n\nBy taking the connection of thoughts and truth as the basic issue of\nsemantics and regarding sentences as \u201cthe proper means of\nexpression for a thought\u201d (Frege 1979a [1897]), Frege paved the\nway for the 20th century priority of sentential meaning\nover lexical meaning: the semantic properties of subsentential\nexpressions such as individual words were regarded as derivative, and\nidentified with their contribution to sentential meaning. Sentential\nmeaning was in turn identified with truth conditions, most explicitly\nin Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus logico-philosophicus\n(1922). However, Frege never lost interest in the \u201cbuilding\nblocks of thoughts\u201d (Frege 1979b [1914]), i.e., in the semantic\nproperties of subsentential expressions. Indeed, his theory of sense\nand reference for names and predicates may be counted as the inaugural\ncontribution to lexical semantics within the analytic tradition (see\nthe entry on\n Gottlob Frege).\n It should be noted that Frege did not attribute semantic properties\nto lexical units as such, but to what he regarded as a\nsentence\u2019s logical constituents: e.g., not to the word\n\u2018dog\u2019 but to the predicate \u2018is a dog\u2019. In\nlater work this distinction was obliterated and Frege\u2019s semantic\nnotions came to be applied to lexical units.\n\nPossibly because of lack of clarity affecting the notion of sense, and\nsurely because of Russell\u2019s (1905) authoritative criticism of\nFregean semantics, word meaning disappeared from the philosophical\nscene during the 1920s and 1930s. In Wittgenstein\u2019s\nTractatus the \u201creal\u201d lexical units, i.e., the\nconstituents of a completely analyzed sentence, are just names, whose\nsemantic properties are exhausted by their reference. In\nTarski\u2019s (1933) work on formal languages, which was taken as\ndefinitional of the very field of semantics for some time, lexical\nunits are semantically categorized into different classes (individual\nconstants, predicative constants, functional constants) depending on\nthe logical type of their reference, i.e., according to whether they\ndesignate individuals in a domain of interpretation, classes of\nindividuals (or of n-tuples of individuals), or functions\ndefined over the domain. However, Tarski made no attempt nor felt any\nneed to represent semantic differences among expressions belonging to\nthe same logical type (e.g., between one-place predicates such as\n\u2018dog\u2019 and \u2018run\u2019, or between two-place\npredicates such as \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018left of\u2019). See\nthe entry on\n Alfred Tarski.\n\nQuine (1943) and Church (1951) rehabilitated Frege\u2019s distinction\nof sense and reference. Non-designating words such as\n\u2018Pegasus\u2019 cannot be meaningless: it is precisely the\nmeaning of \u2018Pegasus\u2019 that allows speakers to establish\nthat the word lacks reference. Moreover, as Frege (1892) had argued,\ntrue factual identities such as \u201cMorning Star = Evening\nStar\u201d do not state synonymies; if they did, any competent\nspeaker of the language would be aware of their truth. Along these\nlines, Carnap (1947) proposed a new formulation of the sense/reference\ndichotomy, which was translated into the distinction between\nintension and extension. The notion of intension was\nintended to be an explicatum of Frege\u2019s\n\u201cobscure\u201d notion of sense: two expressions have the same\nintension if and only if they have the same extension in every\npossible world or, in Carnap\u2019s terminology, in every state\ndescription (i.e., in every maximal consistent set of atomic\nsentences and negations of atomic sentences). Thus,\n\u2018round\u2019 and \u2018spherical\u2019 have the same\nintension (i.e., they express the same function from possible worlds\nto extensions) because they apply to the same objects in every\npossible world. Carnap later suggested that intensions could be\nregarded as the content of lexical semantic competence: to know the\nmeaning of a word is to know its intension, \u201cthe general\nconditions which an object must fulfill in order to be denoted by\n[that] word\u201d (Carnap 1955). However, such general conditions\nwere not spelled out by Carnap (1947). Consequently, his system did\nnot account, any more than Tarski\u2019s, for semantic differences\nand relations among words belonging to the same semantic category:\nthere were possible worlds in which the same individual a\ncould be both a married man and a bachelor, as no constraints were\nplaced on either word\u2019s intension. One consequence, as Quine\n(1951) pointed out, was that Carnap\u2019s system, which was supposed\nto single out analytic truths as true in every possible world,\n\u201cBachelors are unmarried\u201d\u2014intuitively, a\nparadigmatic analytic truth\u2014turned out to be synthetic rather\nthan analytic.\n\nTo remedy what he agreed was an unsatisfactory feature of his system,\nCarnap (1952) introduced meaning postulates, i.e.,\nstipulations on the relations among the extensions of lexical items.\nFor example, the meaning postulate\n\n(MP)\\(\\forall x\n(\\mbox{bachelor}(x) \\supset \\mathord{\\sim}\\mbox{married}\n(x))\\)\n\n\nstipulates that any individual that is in the extension of\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 is not in the extension of\n\u2018married\u2019. Meaning postulates can be seen either as\nrestrictions on possible worlds or as relativizing analyticity to\npossible worlds. On the former option we shall say that \u201cIf Paul\nis a bachelor then Paul is unmarried\u201d holds in every\nadmissible possible world, while on the latter we shall say\nthat it holds in every possible world in which (MP) holds.\nCarnap regarded the two options as equivalent; nowadays, the former is\nusually preferred. Carnap (1952) also thought that meaning postulates\nexpressed the semanticist\u2019s \u201cintentions\u201d with\nrespect to the meanings of the descriptive constants, which may or may\nnot reflect linguistic usage; again, today postulates are usually\nunderstood as expressing semantic relations (synonymy, analytic\nentailment, etc.) among lexical items as currently used by competent\nspeakers.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Montague (1974) and other\nphilosophers and linguists (Kaplan, Kamp, Partee, and D. Lewis among\nothers) set out to apply to the analysis of natural language the\nnotions and techniques that had been introduced by Tarski and Carnap\nand further developed in Kripke\u2019s possible worlds semantics (see\nthe entry on\n Montague semantics).\n Montague semantics can be represented as aiming to capture the\ninferential structure of a natural language: every inference that a\ncompetent speaker would regard as valid should be derivable in the\ntheory. Some such inferences depend for their validity on syntactic\nstructure and on the logical properties of logical words, like the\ninference from \u201cEvery man is mortal and Socrates is a man\u201d\nto \u201cSocrates is mortal\u201d. Other inferences depend on\nproperties of non-logical words that are usually regarded as semantic,\nlike the inference from \u201cKim is pregnant\u201d to \u201cKim is\nnot a man\u201d. In Montague semantics, such inferences are taken\ncare of by supplementing the theory with suitable Carnapian meaning\npostulates. Yet, some followers of Montague regarded such additions as\nspurious: the aims of semantics, they said, should be distinguished\nfrom those of lexicography. The description of the meaning of\nnon-logical words requires considerable world knowledge: for example,\nthe inference from \u201cKim is pregnant\u201d to \u201cKim is not\na man\u201d is based on a \u201cbiological\u201d rather than on a\n\u201clogical\u201d generalization. Hence, we should not expect a\nsemantic theory to furnish an account of how any two expressions\nbelonging to the same syntactic category differ in meaning (Thomason\n1974). From such a viewpoint, Montague semantics would not differ\nsignificantly from Tarskian semantics in its account of lexical\nmeaning. But not all later work within Montague\u2019s program shared\nsuch a skepticism about representing aspects of lexical meaning within\na semantic theory, using either componential analysis (Dowty 1979) or\nmeaning postulates (Chierchia & McConnell-Ginet 2000).\n\nFor those who believe that meaning postulates can exhaust lexical\nmeaning, the issue arises of how to choose them, i.e., of\nhow\u2014and whether\u2014to delimit the set of meaning-relevant\ntruths with respect to the set of all true statements in which a given\nword occurs. As we just saw, Carnap himself thought that the choice\ncould only be the expression of the semanticist\u2019s intentions.\nHowever, we seem to share intuitions of analyticity, i.e., we\nseem to regard some, but not all sentences of a natural language as\ntrue by virtue of the meaning of the occurring words. Such intuitions\nare taken to reflect objective semantic properties of the language,\nthat the semanticist should describe rather than impose at will. Quine\n(1951) did not challenge the existence of such intuitions, but he\nargued that they could not be cashed out in the form of a\nscientifically respectable criterion separating analytic truths\n(\u201cBachelors are unmarried\u201d) from synthetic truths\n(\u201cAldo\u2019s uncle is a bachelor\u201d), whose truth does not\ndepend on meaning alone. Though Quine\u2019s arguments were often\ncriticized (for recent criticisms, see Williamson 2007), and in spite\nof Chomsky\u2019s constant endorsement of analyticity (see e.g. 2000:\n47, 61\u20132), within philosophy the analytic/synthetic distinction\nwas never fully vindicated (for an exception, see Russell 2008).\nHence, it was widely believed that lexical meaning could not be\nadequately described by meaning postulates. Fodor and Lepore (1992)\nargued that this left semantics with two options: lexical meanings\nwere either atomic (i.e., they could not be specified by\ndescriptions involving other meanings) or they were holistic,\ni.e., only the set of all true sentences of the language could count\nas fixing them.\n\nNeither alternative looked promising. Holism incurred in objections\nconnected with the acquisition and the understanding of language: how\ncould individual words be acquired by children, if grasping their\nmeaning involved, somehow, semantic competence on the whole language?\nAnd how could individual sentences be understood if the information\nrequired to understand them exceeded the capacity of human working\nmemory? (For an influential criticism of several varieties of holism,\nsee Dummett 1991; for a review, Pagin 2006). Atomism, in turn, ran\nagainst strong intuitions of (at least some) relations among words\nbeing part of a language\u2019s semantics: it is because of what\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 means that it doesn\u2019t make sense to\nsuppose we could discover that some bachelors are married. Fodor\n(1998) countered this objection by reinterpreting allegedly semantic\nrelations as metaphysically necessary connections among extensions of\nwords. However, sentences that are usually regarded as analytic, such\nas \u201cBachelors are unmarried\u201d, are not easily seen as just\nmetaphysically necessary truths like \u201cWater is\nH2O\u201d. If water is H2O, then its\nmetaphysical essence consists in being H2O (whether we know\nit or not); but there is no such thing as a metaphysical essence that\nall bachelors share\u2014an essence that could be hidden to us, even\nthough we use the word \u2018bachelor\u2019 competently. On the\ncontrary, on acquiring the word \u2018bachelor\u2019 we acquire the\nbelief that bachelors are unmarried (Quine 1986); by contrast, many\nspeakers that have \u2018water\u2019 in their lexical repertoire do\nnot know that water is H2O. The difficulties of atomism and\nholism opened the way to vindications of molecularism (e.g., Perry\n1994; Marconi 1997), the view on which only some relations among words\nmatter for acquisition and understanding (see the entry on\n meaning holism).\n\nWhile mainstream formal semantics went with Carnap and Montague,\nsupplementing the Tarskian apparatus with the possible worlds\nmachinery and defining meanings as intensions, Davidson (1967, 1984)\nput forth an alternative suggestion. Tarski had shown how to provide a\ndefinition of the truth predicate for a (formal) language L:\nsuch a definition is materially adequate (i.e., it is a definition of\ntruth, rather than of some other property of sentences of\nL) if and only if it entails every biconditional of the\nform\n\n(T) S is true in\nL iff p,\n\n\nwhere S is a sentence of L and p is its\ntranslation into the metalanguage of L in which the definition\nis formulated. Thus, Tarski\u2019s account of truth presupposes that\nthe semantics of both L and its metalanguage is fixed\n(otherwise it would be undetermined whether S translates into\np). On Tarski\u2019s view, each biconditional of form (T)\ncounts as a \u201cpartial definition\u201d of the truth predicate\nfor sentences of L (see the entry on\n Tarski\u2019s truth definitions).\n By contrast, Davidson suggested that if one took the notion of truth\nfor granted, then T-biconditionals could be read as collectively\nconstituting a theory of meaning for L, i.e., as stating truth\nconditions for the sentences of L. For example,\n\n(W) \u201cIf the\nweather is bad then Sharon is sad\u201d is true in English iff either\nthe weather is not bad or Sharon is sad\n\n\nstates the truth conditions of the English sentence \u201cIf the\nweather is bad then Sharon is sad\u201d. Of course, (W) is\nintelligible only if one understands the language in which it is\nphrased, including the predicate \u2018true in English\u2019.\nDavidson thought that the recursive machinery of Tarski\u2019s\ndefinition of truth could be transferred to the suggested semantic\nreading, with extensions to take care of the forms of natural language\ncomposition that Tarski had neglected because they had no analogue in\nthe formal languages he was dealing with. Unfortunately, few of such\nextensions were ever spelled out by Davidson or his followers.\nMoreover, it is difficult to see how, giving up possible worlds and\nintensions in favor of a purely extensional theory, the Davidsonian\nprogram could account for the semantics of propositional attitude\nascriptions of the form \u201cA believes (hopes, imagines, etc.) that\np\u201d.\n\nConstrued as theorems of a semantic theory, T-biconditionals were\noften accused of being uninformative (Putnam 1975; Dummett 1976): to\nunderstand them, one has to already possess the information they are\nsupposed to provide. This is particularly striking in the case of\nlexical axioms such as the following:\n\n(V1)  Val(x,\n\u2018man\u2019) iff x is a man;\n(V2)  Val(\\(\\langle\nx,y\\rangle\\), \u2018knows\u2019) iff x knows\ny.\n\n\n(To be read, respectively, as \u201cthe predicate \u2018man\u2019\napplies to x if and only if x is a man\u201d and\n\u201cthe predicate \u2018know\u2019 applies to the pair \\(\\langle\nx, y\\rangle\\) if and only if x knows y\u201d). Here\nit is apparent that in order to understand (V1) one must know what\n\u2018man\u2019 means, which is just the information that (V1) is\nsupposed to convey (as the theory, being purely extensional,\nidentifies meaning with reference). Some Davidsonians, though\nadmitting that statements such as (V1) and (V2) are in a sense\n\u201cuninformative\u201d, insist that what (V1) and (V2) state is\nno less \u201csubstantive\u201d (Larson & Segal 1995). To prove\ntheir point, they appeal to non-homophonic versions of lexical axioms,\ni.e., to the axioms of a semantic theory for a language that does not\ncoincide with the (meta)language in which the theory itself is\nphrased. Such would be, e.g.,\n\n(V3)\nVal(x, \u2018man\u2019) si et seulement si\nx est un homme.\n\n\n(V3), they argue, is clearly substantive, yet what it says is exactly\nwhat (V1) says, namely, that the word \u2018man\u2019 applies to a\ncertain category of objects. Therefore, if (V3) is substantive, so is\n(V1). But this is beside the point. The issue is not whether (V1)\nexpresses a proposition; it clearly does, and it is, in this sense,\n\u201csubstantive\u201d. But what is relevant here is informative\npower: to one who understands the metalanguage of (V3), i.e., French,\n(V3) may communicate new information, whereas there is no circumstance\nin which (V1) would communicate new information to one who understands\nEnglish.\n",
