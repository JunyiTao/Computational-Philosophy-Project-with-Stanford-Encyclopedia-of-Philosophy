Introduction\n\n\nThe most general conception of change is simply difference or\nnonidentity in the features of things. Thus we speak of the change of\ntemperature from place-to-place along a body, or the change in\natmospheric pressures from place-to-place as recorded by isobars, or\nthe change of height of the surface of the earth as recorded by a\ncontour map. Contour lines record sameness in quantities (such as 100\nmetres) from the same quantity-kind (such as height), and the\ndifferences recorded by different contour lines are\nquantity-differences (100 metres as opposed to 200 metres). The\nphilosophical question here is how to construe such statements of\nidentity and nonidentity, and it seems that the problem of universals\nis the main issue.\n\n\nA narrower usage of \u201cchange\u201d is exemplified by change in\nthe properties of a body over time, that is temporal change. This\nessay will focus on temporal change. We begin by separating the\nconcept of change from several cognate concepts, specifically cause,\ntime and motion. Then we briefly survey attempts by such thinkers as\nParmenides and McTaggart to deny change. There follows an account of\nthe problem of the instant of change, where it is concluded that the\nproblem is too general to admit a single solution, but requires\nspecification of further metaphysical principles envisaged as\nconstraints on a type of solution. The final three sections, the bulk\nof the essay, consider the question of the consistency or\ninconsistency of change, which in one way or another looms over all\nour discussions. It emerges that the case for change as an\ninconsistent process is stronger than might be expected.\n2. Change, Cause, Time, Motion\n\n\nOur interest in this essay will be on the special case of temporal\nchange. So construed, the notion of change is obviously bound up with\nnotions of cause, time and motion. Now a distinction between change\nand cause can certainly be drawn. It is clear that uncaused change is\nconceptually possible, and arguably actual in such things as\nradioactive decay. Conversely, the operation of a sustaining cause\nresults in no change in a thing, if the thing would otherwise be\nundergoing a change which the sustaining cause prevents. Hence, the\noperation of a cause on a thing is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor change in that thing. Accordingly, we put the topic of cause in\nthe background when discussing change.\n\n\nTime cannot be so backgrounded. The thesis that time could pass\nwithout change in anything at all has proved controversial, and we\nhave adopted the usage that change in a thing implies the passage of\ntime. Aristotle nonetheless argued that change is distinct from time\nbecause change occurs at different rates, whereas time does not\n(Physics IV,10). This essay focusses on the topic of change,\nwhile not denying that the topic of time is inseparable from\nit. Motion, as change in place, will figure prominently in our\ndiscussion.\n\n\nOne well-known idea is that of Cambridge change. This can be arrived\nat by following the well-tried analytical technique of re-casting\nphilosophically important discussions and concepts in the\nmeta-language. Thus a Cambridge change in a thing is a change in the\ndescriptions (truly) borne by the thing. The phrase \u201cCambridge\nchange\u201d seems to be due to Geach (1969, 71\u20132), who so named it\nto mark its employment by great Cambridge philosophers such as\nRussell and McTaggart. It is apparent that Cambridge change includes\nall cases ordinarily thought of as change, such as change of colour,\nfrom \u201cred\u201d to \u201cnon-red.\u201d But it also includes\nchanges in the relational predicates of a thing, such as when I\nchange from having \u201cnon-brother\u201d true of me to having\n\u201cbrother\u201d true of me, just when my mother gives birth to a\nsecond son. It might seem faintly paradoxical that there need be no\n(other) changes in me (height, weight, colouring, memories,\ncharacter, thoughts) in this circumstance, but it is simply a\nconsequence of the above piece of metalinguistic ascent. It does\npoint up, though, that in attempting to capture the object-language\nconcept, one should take note of the distinction between the monadic\nor internal or intrinsic properties of a thing, and its relations or\nexternal or extrinsic features. Thus the natural view of change is\nthat real, metaphysical change in a thing would be change in the\nmonadic or internal or intrinsic properties of the thing. We will\nreturn to this point in Section 5.\n3. Denying Change\n\n\nIt is on the face of it extremely implausible to deny change, but\nextreme implausibility has not always deterred philosophers. The\nEleatics (C5th BCE), particularly Parmenides, appear to have been the\nfirst to do so. Parmenides maintained that whatever one speaks about\nor thinks about must in some sense exist; if it did not exist then it\nis nothing, so one would be speaking or thinking about nothing, which\nwould be empty. From this thesis, it is deduced that the existing\nthing cannot have come into existence, because to say that it could\nwould be to speak of a time when it did not exist. By similar\nreasoning, existing things are eternal because they cannot go out of\nexistence. It is now a small step to conclude that change is an\nillusion, on the grounds that a change in a thing implies that there\nwas a time when the thing-as-changed did not exist. However, this\nargument is not persuasive: the premiss that the non-existent cannot\nbe thought or spoken about is dubious.\n\n\nParmenides\u2019 disciples Melissus and Zeno developed this\ntheme. Melissus argued that motion implies empty space to move into,\nbut empty space is a nothing and so cannot exist, so that motion is\nimpossible since it implies a contradiction. This argument requires\nthe dubious premisses (1) that empty space is a nothing (which is\ndenied by realists from Newton to Nerlich), and (2) that motion would\nhave to be change relative to space. Even those who have held that\nempty space is a nothing (relationists from Leibniz to Mach and\nonward) have not generally denied motion, proposing instead that\nmotion of a thing is change in the spatial relations between that\nthing and other things.\n\n\nZeno\u2019s brilliant paradoxes are generally accounted as attempts to\ndefend Parmenides. We will not look at these in detail, but his\nparadox of the arrow is relevant to what follows. This is the argument\nthat an arrow in flight could not really be moving because at any\ngiven instant it would be at a place identical with itself (and not\nanother place); something at just one (self-identical) place could not\nbe described as moving, and an arrow which is motionless at every\ninstant in a temporal interval must be motionless throughout the\ninterval. Discussion of this subtle argument is deferred until\ndiscussion in a later section of Graham Priest\u2019s position, which turns\non similar premisses.\n\n\nMcTaggart\u2019s well-known argument (1908) that time is unreal applies\nequally to the unreality of (temporal) change it seems. McTaggart\ndistinguished between two ways of attributing temporal\ncharacteristics to events. The \\(A\\)-series of events is given\nby the descriptions \u201cpast,\u201d \u201cpresent\u201d and\n\u201cfuture,\u201d while the \\(B\\)-series is strictly in terms\nof the relational concepts \u201cearlier,\u201d\n\u201csimultaneous\u201d and \u201clater.\u201d Now the\n\\(B\\)-series is insufficient to define change, because\n\\(B\\)-series relations apply unchangingly if they apply at all;\nwhatever is earlier than something is always earlier than\nit. Moreover, the \\(B\\)-series presupposes the \\(A\\)-series\nsince if \\(X\\) precedes \\(Y\\) then there must be a time\nwhen \\(X\\) is past and \\(Y\\) present. This step in the\nargument is not at all absurd: the discovery of spacetime, the\nrelativistic realisation of the \\(B\\)-series, has impelled many\nfrom Minkowski on to describe it as a \u201cstatic\u201d conception\nof time. A genuinely dynamic conception of change would thus need to\nhave things coming into and going out of existence with the passage\nof time, whereas spacetime invites quantification over it all\n\u201cat once\u201d as it were.\n\n\nThus according to McTaggart the source of time and change must be\nfound in the \\(A\\)-series. But the \\(A\\)-series implies a\nvicious regress. Any event must have all three properties, pastness,\npresentness and futurity, but this is a contradiction. The only way\nout of the contradiction is to say that the event is past, present\nand future at different times; but the same question arises about the\ntemporal instants themselves, which would force us to appeal to a\nfurther time series to avoid the contradiction.\n\n\nWhatever we make of this argument, and much has been written about it,\nit highlights the baffling nature of the apparent passage of time. In \nparticular, if temporal flux is denied then at the least an explanation \nof its intuitive naturalness is mandatory. For a close analysis, see the \nentry Savitt (2006) in this Encyclopedia. \n \n\nHowever, one thing can be said about all the above denials of change:\nthey all argue against change on the ground that it implies a\ncontradiction. But the assumption of the consistency of change has\nbeen denied by a number of influential figures, as we will see.\n4. The Instant of Change\n\n\nConsider a car moving off from rest at exactly noon. What is its\nstate of motion at the instant of change? If it is in motion, when\ndid it start? And if it is motionless, when could it ever begin? This\nproblem was explored by Medlin (1963), Hamblin (1969), and\nothers. Put this way, a solution for at least some special cases is\nreadily available. Locate the time origin \\(t = 0\\) at noon. If\nthe car\u2019s position function \\(f\\) is given by, say,\n\\(f(t) = t^{2}\\), then its speed is\n\\(2t\\). If motion is defined as having non-zero speed, then the\ncar is motionless at \\(t=0\\). On the other hand, at all\n\\(t \\gt 0\\) it is in motion, so there is surely no puzzle about\nwhen it could ever begin: there is no first instant of motion.\n\n\nHowever, there are more troublesome special cases. Suppose that the\ncar\u2019s position function is given by: \\(f(t)=0\\) for all \\(t \\lt\n0\\), else \\(f(t)=t\\). Then speed is zero for all \\(t \\lt 0\\), and\nspeed is 1 for all \\(t \\gt 0\\). But what of \\(t = 0\\)? One should\navoid \u201carbitrary\u201d solutions, which attribute one speed\nrather than another, but do not give a reason for so\nprivileging. There is of course at least one simple solution that is\nnon-arbitrary, namely that it is neither in motion nor motionless,\nsince its speed is indeterminate at \\(t = 0\\).  This solution derives\nfrom the fact that according to classical calculus there is no\nderivative of such a function at \\(t = 0\\).\n\n\nBut can we do no better? The present author (1985) proposed to set\naside the problem until more is said about various possible\nconstraints on the solution. Unless we had some reason to think that\nsuch functions really did describe the world, we might well feel that\na solution was less than imperative and less than unique. For\nexample, the world might be described wholly with \\(C^{\\infty}\\)\nfunctions \\((n\\)-th derivatives exist for all \\(n\\), e.g.,\ncos, sin, log, exponential functions). The above function is not\namong these, since its derivative is discontinuous. But then it isn\u2019t\nclear what we might say of it if the example is counterfactual. There\nmight be different things to say depending on what further principles\ndescribe the possible world. Hence we would need to supplement the\noriginal statement of the problem with an argument to the effect that\nwe might expect such functions to describe the real world, or\nalternatively supply additional metaphysical principles to be\nregarded as constraints on the solution.\n\n\nA related problem is the fracture problem, described by\nMedlin. Imagine fracturing a material body such as a piece of wood,\nregarded as a plenum (full of matter). What is the state of the two\nnew surfaces after the fracture? Unless matter is to be created or\ndestroyed, we seem to have to say that the break is half-open, with\none new matter-surface being topologically closed and the other being\ntopologically open. But which surface is which? There seems to be no\nprinciple to determine which. In response, it can be asked how\nseriously we have to take the postulation of a plenum. If for example\nmatter is as Boscovich suggested, punctate and surrounded by fields,\nthen there are no plena, and the problem is no more than\nhypothetical. Or again, there might be plena but other principles\nmight apply. For example, mass-density functions might drop smoothly\nto zero at the boundaries between matter and empty space, which would\nmean that all surfaces were open. On the other hand, it might be\ninstead that as a matter of fact all surfaces are topologically\nclosed. This would need an inconsistent solution (see below, sections\n5\u20137).\n5. Consistent and Inconsistent Change\n\n\nIf a changing thing has different and incompatible properties then a\ncontradiction is threatened. The obvious move to make when confronted\nwith the fact that things change, is to say with Kant (1781) that\nthey change in relation to time, which avoids the inconsistency. But\nthen another problem emerges. In what sense can one thing persist\nthrough change? Identity across time and space is the mark of\nuniversals, but we also account particulars such as billiard balls\nand persons as having self-identity across time.\n\n Aristotle\u2019s views on the persistence of things are worth noting here.\nAt the risk of gross oversimplification of what is treated thoroughly\nelsewhere (see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics, it\ncan be said that early on he took the view that what persists over\ntime and through change, the substrate, can be identified\nwith matter, and that it is the form of matter which\nis acquired or lost (Physics I, 5\u20137). When he wrote the\nCategories, it is substance which is said to be\nsusceptible of contrary attributions; and as such substance itself has\nno opposites. (Categories 4a10). In the Metaphysics \\(Z\\), a more\ncomplex doctrine of substance, that which \\(is\\), is worked\nout. Substance is not the substrate, matter, since that lacks\nparticularity. Its substance, what it is to be that\nthing, that without which it does not exist, is its\nessence. Aristotle then links essence with his theory of\ncauses, being identified variously with its final cause and with its\nformal cause. \n\n Although Aristotle\u2019s views about change \u2014 in particular, his\ndistinction between essence and accident \u2014 have sometimes been\nthought to contain a solution to the problem of persistent identity\nthrough change, it seems to this author that they do not really get a\ngrip on the problem in its most fundamental form. This is perhaps\nclearest in the Categories, where the ability of substance to admit\nincompatible accidental features is more-or-less definitional.\n\n The problem can be made sharper by reflection upon the law of the\nindiscernibility of identicals. If a thing-at-\\(t_{1}\\)\nwere identical with a thing-at-\\(t_{2}\\), then they\nshould share all their properties. What sort of identity is it, if\nnot that? But if the properties at different times are incompatible,\nthen a contradiction follows. Because they emphatically took the view\nthat contradictions are never true, the great Buddhist logicians\nDharmakirti (C7th CE) and his commentator Dharmottara (C8\u20139th CE),\nwho had certainly read their Aristotle, deduced that identity over\ntime does not exist (see Scherbatsky (1930) vol 2). This is the\nBuddhist doctrine of moments, essentially an ontology of\ninstantaneous temporal slices. The doctrine of the momentariness of\nexistence is felicitously in accord with the core Buddhist doctrine\nof the impermanence of all things. The doctrine of moments might seem\nto be an unnecessarily strong application of impermanence, certainly\nunnecessary for soteriological purposes, were it not for the evident\nstrength of the argument in its favour, not to mention its accord\nwith the spacetime ontology of modern physics. On the other hand, it\nis of course psychologically very difficult to believe that one\u2019s own\nself, as something genuinely self-identical, has not endured from\nmoment-to-moment in the past. Even so, the thesis of the\nmomentariness of human existence has had a recent defender in Derek\nParfit (1984), who asks what sort of principle could unify the\ntemporal stages sufficiently closely to be worth calling identity. He\nargues that none could, and proposes that internalising the\nmomentariness of our lives has a beneficial effect on how we should\nface our deaths.\n\n This theme is echoed in a recent debate on the topic of\n\u2018temporary intrinsics\u2019, which also connects with the\nearlier-mentioned concept of Cambridge change. Cambridge change in a\nthing is still change in something or other, but it is not\nalways change in the thing itself. Thus we might seek to\nisolate change in the thing itself by change in its\nintrinsic properties. But then we have the problem of in\nwhat sense it continues to be just one thing through a change in its\nintrinsic properties. Now obviously this raises the question of how\nto define the concept of intrinsicality. We do not address that here,\nsince it is discussed elsewhere in this Encyclopedia, see\nWeatherson (2002). So assuming a prima facie distinction\nbetween the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of a thing, how does a\nthing persist through changes in its intrinsic properties? David\nLewis and others debated this question, e.g., Lewis\n(1986), (1988). Several options for a solution were canvassed, three\nof which were as follows.\n\n (1) The basic existents are things indexed by times, that is\ntime-slices. What primarily exist are things-at-a-time:\n\u201c\\(a\\) is red at \\(t\\)\u201d is rendered\n\u201c\\(a\\)-at-\\(t\\) is red\u201d. Things that persist over\ntime are then wholes made up of such parts, and one says that\npersisting things perdure rather than endure. This\nis the solution favoured by Lewis, by the present author, and by\nspace-time theory.\n\n (2) A second option is to say that, instead of indexing things, one\nindexes properties: \u201c\\(a\\) is red at \\(t\\)\u201d is\nrendered as \u201c\\(a\\) is red-at-\\(t\\)\u201d. This option\ndoes not seem to have had any defenders, perhaps because those\nproperties which are universals are supposed to be wholly in each of\ntheir instances, which the indexing apparently denies.\n\n (3) A third option takes as its basic minimal idea that the index\nmodifies the whole event: \\((a\\)\u2019s being red) holds at \\(t\\). A\nvariant is to take the index as modifying the exemplification\n\u2018relation\u2019: \\(a\\) exemplifies-at-\\(t\\) redness. Versions\nof this position were urged by several contributors: Johnston (1987),\nLowe (1987), (1988), Haslanger (1989). However, the problem for\nadverbial-style analyses anywhere is to provide enough semantics,\nenough logical structure for the event, to account for the logical\nimplications of the sentences under analysis, as Davidson (1967)\npointed out. So for example one has things like: \\((((Fa)\\) at \\(t)\n\\amp a=b)\\) implies \\(((Fb)\\) at \\(t)\\); or \\((((Fa)\\) at \\(t_{1})\n\\amp((Ga)\\) at \\(t_{2}) \\amp(F\\) is incompatible with \\(G))\\) implies\nnot \\(t_{1}=t_{2}\\); or \\((((Fa)\\) at \\(t) \\amp((Gb)\\) at \\(t)\n\\amp(F\\) is incompatible with \\(G))\\) implies not \\(a=b\\). One thus\ncannot rest with a minimalist position. At least Lewis\u2019 has the\nmerit of providing a viable semantics, a direct parallel with\ncounterpart theory in modal semantics. Of course, the basic ontology\nof Lewis\u2019 favoured position was Dharmakirti\u2019s though Lewis\ndid not note that fact. More to the point, Dharmakirti\u2019s\nstrategy did not depend on the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction. The\nproblem of contradictory attributions occurs even if the attributions\nare extrinsic, and Dharmakirti\u2019s argument is a straightforward\napplication of Leibniz\u2019 law to things-at-a-time. If time-slices\nare admitted at all, and it is hard not to do so if they are\nsanctioned by relativity theory, then Dharmakirti\u2019s argument\ngoes through. \n\n\nOthers have taken a different course on the issue of the consistency\nof change. Herakleitos (C6th BCE) wrote in a suggestive fashion, with\nhis doctrine of the unity of opposites. However, his few surviving\nsentences are too obscure and fragmentary to give much confidence in\ninterpretation. He spoke of the same river having different waters at\ndifferent times, but there is no development of the\nobservation. Similarly he spoke of the sea as being at one time both\nlife-preserving (to fish) and death-dealing (to humans), and\n\u201cthe path up and the path down are one and the same.\u201d These\nexamples hardly force one to believe in true contradictions,\nhowever.\n\n\nThere is also in Herakleitos the idea that everything is in a state\nof flux, always changing, and that it is the struggle between\nopposites (opposed tendencies) which drives change. This can be seen\nas an early version of the Marxist dynamic of dialectical\nmaterialism. But without a separate argument for the inconsistency of\nchange, there is no reason to think that it remains anything but a\nformally consistent theory.\n\n\nHegel was more explicit. In The Science of Logic he said\nthat only insofar as something has contradiction in itself does it\nmove, have impulse or activity. Indeed, movement is existing\ncontradiction itself. \u201cSomething moves not because at one moment\nof time it is here and at another there, but because at one and the\nsame moment it is here and not here.\u201d (Hegel (1812) p. 440).\n\n\nThere is something appealing in this argument. As Priest and Routley\nput it, \u201cin change\u2026 there is at each stage a moment when\nthe changing item is both in a given state, because it has just\nreached that state, but also not in that state, because it is not\nstationary but moving through and beyond that state\u201d (Priest,\nRoutley and Norman, 1989, p. 7). Think of a body coming to rest at a\ngiven time, and compare it with the same body proceeding on to\nfurther motion. There must be something about the body at that\ninstant which distinguishes the two scenarios, or there could be\nnothing at the time to count as continuing change. Cause cannot do\nit, for a body can continue in its state of motion without being\nimpressed by an external force, as Newton taught us. Nor can mere\nvelocity do it, since velocity is a relation to surrounding\npoints. Indeed, there is no difference in velocity between a body\nmomentarily at rest, and a body at rest for a period around the\ninstant; yet one is changing and the other not.\n\n\nWe will look more closely at this argument in the next\nsection. However, here we can remind ourselves of Hegel\u2019s\nidealism. Just about everyone agrees that contradictions within ideas\nare easier to swallow than contradictions in the external world. In\nthe special case of the phenomenology of motion, it is not such an\nabsurd speculation that what distinguishes the direct perception of\nmotion from the mere static memory of difference in position, is that\nnearby small variations in the stimulus are read into a kind of\nbuffer where they are not compared as static memory does so much as\noverlapped or superimposed in the way that contradictions are. After\nall, we are not at all good at discriminating small intervals of\ntime, as the success of 25 frames per second makes apparent. Thus,\nthe mind constructs a kind of contradictory theory which undergoes\nconstant update. Indeed, this may well be the source of the\ntroublesome intuition we noted earlier, that it is one and the same\nthing which endures through change, even though it is acknowledged\nthat it has different properties at different (nearby) times. If this\nis right, then if one thinks with Hegel that the world is a kind of\nidea, then the contradictoriness of ideas such as motion is apt to\nspill over to the contradictoriness of their realisations in the\nworld. Indeed, even without the assumption of full-blown idealism,\nthere is always the caution that if a theory (consistent or not) can\nbe made out which describes an epistemic state, i.e., a cognitive\nstate, then how can we be entirely confident that the world simply\ncould not be that way? \n\n\nTaking a far less ambitious view than Hegel, Von Wright (1968)\nnonetheless proposed an interesting account of conditions in which\nchange would have to be regarded as inconsistent. The account\nrequires two conditions. The first condition is that time is regarded\nas structured as nested intervals rather than an assemblage of atomic\npoint-instants. This is an attractive proposal, if only because\nno-one has ever seen a temporal or spatial point. Of course, standard\nrelativity theory proposes that spacetime is punctate, as does the\nusual mathematics of the continuum. But a successful non-punctate\nmathematics using intervals instead can be worked out, albeit with\nconsiderably extra complexity. (see e.g., Weyl 1960). Now in the\nontology of intervals, since there are no atomic points to attach a\nunique proposition to, the most one can say is that a proposition\nholds somewhere in the interval, with the limiting case that it holds\nthroughout the interval.\n\n\nVon Wright\u2019s second condition was then to suppose that an interval\nmight be so structured that a given proposition \\(p\\) and its\nnegation \\(\\neg p\\) are dense in each other throughout the\ninterval. This means that no subinterval, no matter how small, can be\nfound in which just \\(p\\) holds throughout that subinterval, and\nno subinterval can be found in which just \\(\\neg p\\) holds\nthroughout the subinterval: every subinterval in which one holds, the\nother holds as well. From an external point of view admitting\ninstants, we can see that this is a genuine consistent possibility, if\nfor example we think of\n\\(p\\) as the proposition that a rational number of seconds has\npassed, and \\(\\neg p\\) as the proposition that an irrational\nnumber of seconds has passed. These are dense in each other on the\nclassical real line regarded as time. Thus, there is no subinterval\nwhich is purely \\(p\\) throughout and no subinterval which is\npurely \\(\\neg p\\) throughout.\n\n\nThis was von Wright\u2019s proposed account of a continuous change in\nan ontology of intervals. The state \\(\\neg p\\) changes continuously to\n\\(p\\) if there is a preceding interval which is \\(\\neg p\\) throughout,\nthen an interval with \\(\\neg p\\) and \\(p\\) dense in each other, then a\nsucceeding interval with p holding throughout. Von Wright described\nthis as a kind of inconsistency. Unfortunately it is not clear from\nhis written words whether he had in mind that the situation was\ninconsistent or only possibly inconsistent. His argument seems to be\nthis. In an ontology of intervals we begin with descriptions like\n\u201cIt rained here yesterday\u201d which means that it rained\nsometime here yesterday. The basic description is thus \u201c\\(p\\)\nholds (somewhere) in the interval \\(I\\).\u201d The special case where\n\\(p\\) holds throughout \\(I\\) is noted, where to hold throughout is for\nthere to be no subinterval in which \\(\\neg p\\) holds. Now\n\\(p\\)\u2019s holding in \\(I\\) is of course compatible with \\(\\neg\np\\)\u2019s holding in \\(I\\). But there is no contradiction here, as\nlong as there is a partition of \\(I\\) into subintervals such that\n\\(p\\) holds throughout the subinterval or \\(\\neg p\\) holds throughout\nthe subinterval. Thus if we take in that a disjunction holds in an\ninterval just in case there is a partition in which each of the\ndisjuncts holds throughout its subintervals, we can say that if there\nis such a partition for \\(p\\), then the law of excluded middle \\(p\n\\vee \\neg p\\) holds throughout the interval. Von Wright introduced the\nmodal operator \\(Np\\) for \u201cNecessarily \\(p\\).\u201d If we\ndefine \u201c\\(Np\\) holds in \\(I\\)\u201d to mean that \\(p\\) holds\nthroughout \\(I\\), we can say that if there is no continuous change in\nthe above sense, then Excluded Middle LEM holds necessarily, \\(N(p\n\\vee \\neg p)\\). However, defining the modal \u201cPossibly\u201d in\nthe usual way as \\(M =df \\neg N\\neg\\) and assuming de Morgan\u2019s\nLaws, Double Negation and Commutativity, we get the result that in an\ninterval in which there is continuous change, \\(M(p \\amp \\neg p)\\)\nholds, i.e.. a contradiction is possible. Presumably it further\nfollows that in a subinterval which has continuous change throughout,\n\\(N(p \\amp \\neg p)\\) holds. Needless to say this implies that a\ncontradiction is true in that subinterval. We might note that the\nresult that continuous change is a true contradiction follows without\nthe detour through modal logic, since if LEM is false then \\(\\neg(p\n\\vee \\neg p)\\) holds for some \\(p\\), and so by de Morgan and Double\nNegation, \\(p \\amp \\neg p\\) holds (throughout).\n\n\nThis ingenious construction has its problems. It is certainly\ndangerous to assume De Morgan\u2019s Laws and Double Negation when the\nlogic of intervals is the case in point. They both fail for open set\nlogic, which is to say intuitionism, just as they both fail for its\ntopological dual, closed set logic. On the other hand, what is one to\nsay if the world is structured as intervals, non-punctate, and if\nthere are subintervals in which propositions and their negations are\ndense in each other, interspersed with intervals where one of the\npropositions holds throughout? The latter are clearly periods of\nnon-change, and the former are reasonably described as intervals of\nchange. And yet it would seem that the best one can do is to say that\n\\(p \\amp \\neg p\\) holds in the transition periods: there\nappears to be no consistent way of describing what is happening in the\nsituation which adheres to intervals and eschews points.\n6. Inconsistent Motion\n\n\nMany of the above themes come together in Graham Priest\u2019s\ninconsistent account of motion in In Contradiction (1987). Priest\nsets up the opposing consistent account of change as what he calls\nthe cinematic view of change. This is the view that an object in\nmotion does no more than simply occupy different points of space at\ndifferent times, like a succession of stills in a film only\ncontinuously connected. He attributes the view to Russell and\nHume. It is an extrinsic view of change, in the sense that change is\nseen as a matter of a relation to states at nearby instants of time.\nThe best-worked-out version of this view is the usual mathematical\ndescription of change of position by a suitable function of time; and\nthen motion as velocity, that is rate of change of position, is given\nby the first derivative, which is a relation to nearby intervals.\n\n\nPriest wishes instead to have an intrinsic account of change, in which\nit is a matter of the features of the object solely at the instant\nwhether it is changing at the instant. He offers three arguments\nagainst the extrinsic account. First there is the\n\u201cabutment\u201d argument (p. 203). Taking the usual view of\ntime as a continuously distributed collection of point-instants, in\nany change there must be an interval throughout which \\(p\\) holds\nabutting an interval throughout which \\(\\neg p\\) holds. It makes\nno difference whether there is a last instant for \\(p\\) and no\nfirst instant for \\(\\neg p\\), or no last instant for \\(p\\)\nand a first instant for \\(\\neg p\\); either way there is no room\nfor a time at which the system is changing. For example, if we said\nthat the change was at the boundary point, then there would be nothing\nabout that point to distinguish it from the situation where there was\nno change at all because the abutting intervals had the same\nproposition holding throughout each. Hence says Priest there is no\nchange at all in the cinematic view: for change there would have to be\na time when change was occurring, and that is absent in this case.\n\n\nPriest\u2019s second argument (p. 217) appeals to causation. It is at least\nimaginable that the universe is \u201cLaplacean,\u201d by which he\nmeans that the state at any time is determined by the states at prior\ntimes. But if change is cinematic, then there is no sense to saying\nthat the instantaneous state of the world at the prior time determines\nits state at subsequent times: for example, not even velocity is\ndetermined by the intrinsic instantaneous state of a body. Now a\nLaplacean universe is possible, but the cinematic view makes Laplacean\nchange a priori false. Hence Priest concludes by rejecting\nthe Laplacean view. \n\n\nPriest\u2019s third argument (p. 218) is his version of Zeno\u2019s arrow\nargument mentioned earlier. In the cinematic view of change, there is\nnothing about the arrow at any instant to contribute to its motion:\nit is indistinguishable from an arrow at rest. But then there is\nnothing to constitute its motion: an infinite number of zero motions\ndoes not add up to anything but zero motion. In response to the reply\nthat according to measure theory a (nondenumerably) infinite number\nof points of measure zero can have a non-zero measure, Priest argues\nthat this is just mathematics: \u201c\u2026it does not ease the\ndiscomfort \u2026 when one tries to understand how the arrow actually\nachieves its motion. At any point in its motion it advances not at\nall. Yet in some apparently magical way, in a collection of these it\nadvances. Now a sum of nothings, even infinitely many nothings, is\nnothing. So how does it do it?\u201d (pp. 218\u20139)\n\n\nSetting aside questions about the strength of these arguments for the\npresent, how then are we to give an acceptable intrinsic account of\nmotion? According to Priest, the only acceptable answer is Hegel\u2019s:\nthat motion is inconsistent. Support comes from Leibniz\u2019 Continuity\nCondition (LCC). This is essentially the thesis, suitably qualified,\nthat whatever holds up to a limit, holds at the limit. Priest\u2019s\nargument for the LCC appeals to causality. He describes change\nviolating the LCC as \u201ccapricious\u201d (p. 210). Humeans might\nbe able to accept it, but for them there are no connections, nothing\nto constitute past states\u2019 determination of future states. He also\nargues if the LCC fails, change would occur, but \u201cat no\ntime\u201d (p. 210): for a proposition switching values\ndiscontinuously at a boundary there would be no instant identifiable\nby its intrinsic properties alone as the one at which the change\noccurred.\n\n\nPriest\u2019s qualification to the LCC is that it applies only to atomic\nsentences and their negations: otherwise we would have to admit the\ncase where a disjunction \\(p \\vee q\\) held right up to a limit in virtue\nof \\(p\\) holding at the rational points and \\(q\\) holding at\nthe irrational points: this would be capricious behaviour in which we\ncan make no sense of the past determining the future. We would also\nadmit problems if we allowed the LCC to apply to tense operators:\nFuture-\\(p\\) can obviously hold up to a limit without holding at\nthe limit.\n\n\nBut now we observe that the LCC so qualified implies that continuous\nchange is contradictory. For consider any particle with equation of\nmotion \\(x = f(t)\\). Then at \\(t = a\\) its position \\(x =\nf(a)\\). However if it is in motion then in the neighbourhood we have\n\\(\\neg(x = f(a))\\), so by the LCC at the limit also \\(\\neg(x =\nf(a))\\), along with of course \\(x = f(a)\\) as well. Priest amplifies\nthis account by proposing that no moving body can be consistently\nlocalised. Rather, in moving at time \\(t\\) it inconsistently occupies\na small finite (Planck length) lozenge of space, which is made up of\nthe positions it takes in the corresponding lozenge of time\nsurrounding \\(t\\). This gives a natural intrinsic account of\nmotionlessness at \\(t\\), namely that there is no contradiction in its\nposition at \\(t\\). One can propose an account of velocity, as varying\nwith the length of the lozenge or spread of position in the direction\nof motion. There are applications in Quantum Theory, too. The\nHeisenberg uncertainty of position may simply be the size of the\nspread or smeared position. Moreover, there is a possibility for\nbackward causation implicit in the advanced wave front of\ninconsistency affecting earlier states in the inconsistently\nidentified smear of spatial positions; and backward causation may be\nthe way to go with quantum nonlocality, as Huw Price (1996) has\nargued.\n\n\nOne quick objection does not succeed. One might argue that since\nmotion and rest are not relativistically invariant, neither could the\ncontradictoriness in motion be part of the absolute character of\nreality. This may be so, but it does not prevent the concept being of\nuse in the analysis of phenomena by means of frames: frame-relative\ninconsistencies would still be a (relational) part of the world. More\nimportantly, the concept may find its natural home in QM rather than\nGR. It is well-known that there are deep incompatibilities between\nthem as they now stand, but the jury is still out on how to resolve\nthem, and it may well be that absolute motion is a part of the\nsolution.\n\n\nIn asking how strong are the arguments in favour of this well-crafted\nposition, we return to Priest\u2019s three arguments against the rival,\nconsistent, extrinsic, cinematic view. We recall the first argument\nwas the \u201cabutment\u201d argument: consistent change cannot allow\nthat there is a (single) time at which the change takes place. This\nwill not sway the opposition, who will reply that it is the nature of\nchange, even change at a point, that it is relational in that it\nrequires comparison with nearby points; hence the demand for an\nintrinsic conception of change is a mistake.\n\n\nThe second argument was that the cinematic view is incompatible with\nthe Laplacean view that the past determines the present. The way\nPriest puts it is not so plausible: he says that Laplaceanism is\npossible, whereas the cinematic view rules it out \u201ca\npriori\u201d (p. 217). But this is a modal fallacy: the\ncinematic view is only ruled out when one adopts the Laplacean view,\nand so that is only relatively apriori.\n\n\nThe third argument, Zeno\u2019s arrow, has greater force though. How can\nany number, even an infinite number, of zeros add up to a nonzero?\nThe mathematics of measure theory may say that intervals have a\nnon-zero measure whereas individual points are zero, but so what?\nWhat is needed is a story which makes its application intelligible\nand non-arbitrary. If this is not forthcoming, there is the strong\ncounter-intuition that zero marks the absence of existence; and no\nnumber of absent or non-existent things or quantities makes a\npresent, existent thing or quantity.\n\n\nSo Zeno\u2019s argument after all seems to be the most resilient. But the\nLaplacean universe also has appeal. Many philosophers have felt\nuneasy about Hume\u2019s views on causation: if the past does not\ndetermine the future then the universe is indeed capricious. \n\n\nNow one might endeavour to support Russell\u2019s contrary view by arguing\nthat non-zero speed is both necessary and sufficient for motion. But\nboth sides of this equivalence might be disputed. On the necessity of\nnon-zero speed for motion, a challenge might be mounted that zero\nspeed but non-zero acceleration is motion. On the question of the\nsufficiency of non-zero speed for motion, Priest in the second edition\nof In Contradiction (2006) says that he does not deny this. But this\nopens him up a possible objection, namely that if non-zero (speed or\nacceleration) is necessary and sufficient for motion, then the extra\nelement of inconsistency would seem to be explanatorily otiose, since\nthere is no need to add the extra element of inconsistency in order to\nconstitute motion. Such an objection does not refute his view, but it\nwould seem to make it unsimple. Moreover, one might still adopt an\ninconsistent view coupled with the denial of sufficiency, which avoids\nthis objection.\n\n\nIn (2006), Priest extends his account to time itself. Hitherto,\nquantities other than times were regarded as changing to the extent\nthat they were inconsistently smeared out in a small lozenge or spread\nof time. In 2006, even the identity conditions for times are smeared\nout: if \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) are in the same spread then both \\(t_1 =\nt_2\\) and not-\\((t_1 = t_2)\\) hold, and in particular not-\\((t=t)\\)\nholds for each \\(t\\). Priest proposes that this gives explanations of\nseveral perennially puzzling features of time, specifically its flow,\nhow it differs from space, and its direction. Focussing just on flow,\nit is the fact that not-\\((t=t)\\) is constant for all t which supplies\nthe intrinsic feature of time necessary in Hegelian terms for its\nchangingness or flow. The view faces some interesting objections, one\nof which is a sorites-like problem that if times in the same spread\nare (inconsistently) identical with each other, then since any time\nwill be identical with others in the same spread, and those others\nidentical with further times in other spreads, identity will be spread\neverywhere.  Of course, many replies have been made to the sorites,\nbut one might also observe that none are particularly appealing. At\nleast, the arguments need to be worked through for the particular\ncase. \n7. Discontinuous Change and the Leibniz Continuity Condition\n\n\nIf the LCC is to have a chance of being applicable, then it needs\nfurther restriction, beyond atomic sentences and their negations. This\nis because it has implausible consequences when applied to certain\natomic sentences. Consider any increasing function \\(f(t)\\). Then\nsentences of the form \\(f(t) \\lt f(a)\\) will hold for \\(t \\lt a\\). By\nthe LCC then, \\(f(a) \\lt f(a)\\). This is surely a gratuitous\nconclusion even before the contradicting sentence \\(-f(a) \\lt f(a)\\)\nis taken into account. The present author (1997) therefore proposed to\nrestrict the application to the atomic sentences of equational\ntheories, that is to sentences of the form \\(f(t) = 0\\). This is not\nso unreasonable on independent grounds, since the basic laws of nature\nare expressed in equational form.\n\n\nSo restricted, we can note that far from being unreasonable, it turns\nout that the LCC is satisfied in a large class of reasonable models,\nspecifically the C-infinity worlds mentioned earlier, in which every\nfunction is continuous. These include all those of GR. Now a\nC-infinity world gives us a kind of half-way house for cause. It\nmight be that all correlations are coincidences, but at least if\nfunctions are continuous then causation is a distinctive correlation\nin that it is transmitted locally. This can be applied beneficially\nto produce not a general account of inconsistent change, but a\nparticular account of certain inconsistent changes, as follows.\n\n\nQuantum measurement has long been problematic, for more than one\nreason. One reason has been that it represents an irreducibly\ndifferent kind of process from Schr\u00f6dinger evolution. Another is that\nit is change which is discontinuous and yet causal: one can make\nthings to happen with measurement, even though one cannot determine\nthe exact outcome. A third reason is nonlocality itself: the nonlocal\nis ipso facto the discontinuous, and yet the nonlocal is\ngoverned by a kind of statistical causality. But now, to settle at\nleast some of these issues, it has been proposed to utilise the\ntheory of inconsistent continuous functions. These arise when a\nfunction is classically discontinuous, but we inconsistently identify\nthe limit of the function (assuming it has a limit) with its value at\nthe limit. Such functions, by virtue of being continuous, can be\nshown to satisfy the LCC. But granted that the formal details exist,\nwhat reason is there to apply them? It is precisely that we want to\npreserve a degree of causality, that is LCC-causality, while yet\nretaining the essential discontinuity and unpredictability of the\nprocess. Thus the slogan \u201cnonlocality is inconsistent\nlocality,\u201d which is intended not to apply to change in general\nbut to discontinuous change which we nonetheless have reason to think\nof as causal.\n8. Cognition of Motion\n\nAs we saw earlier, the basic case for the inconsistency of change\nturns on the following premisses: (i) \\(Fa\\), (ii) \\(Gb\\),\n(iii) \\(Fx \\rightarrow {\\sim}Gx\\), (iv)\n\\(a=b\\). Up to the last premiss all is consistent, but the\nidentification of the entities a and b from different times gives one\nand the same thing incompatible properties. It was suggested in\nSection 5, taking a lead from Hegel, that even if we say that change\nis a consistent process, the perception of change might well\ninvolve inconsistent representations. It is time to take a closer look\nat what cognitive science can tell us about this. It turns out that\nthe argument is inconclusive, but suggestive. It is useful to\nconcentrate on the example of the perception of motion. A thorough\nsurvey can be found in Palmer (1999), Chapter 10.\n\nA basic mechanism for perceived motion is the Reichardt detector. It\nseems not to be entirely settled whether there are such mechanisms in\nthe CNS. On the other hand, as we see, it is so simple that it is hard\nto imagine that we don\u2019t have Reichardt detectors in our brains. \n\nThe original Reichardt detector involved two spatially-separated\nretinal transducers responding to intensities \\(I_{1}\\), \\(I_{2}\\) of\nincident light respectively at times \\(t_{1}\\),\n\\(t_{2}\\). Essentially, I measures the number of incident photons on a\nsingle retinal cell at a time. (For convenience we can regard the\ninput into a given retinal cell as the same as its output, though the\noutput is electrochemical, as befits a transducer.) One of the two\ninputs, say \\(I_{1}\\), undergoes a delay, and so is compared at a\nlater time \\(t_{2}\\) with the other input \\(I_{2}\\) undelayed. There\nare different ways to make the comparison: Reichardt suggested both\naddition and multiplication, but it is more reasonable to consider\nsubtraction of one from the other (a fixed operation for a given\nReichardt detector). The difference between \\(I_{1}\\) and \\(I_{2}\\) is\nthen propagated further into the CNS. Thus we have a change\ndetector, there is no change in intensity from \\(I_{1}\\) at\n\\(t_{1}\\) to \\(I_{2}\\) at \\(t_{2}\\) iff \\(I_{2} - I_{1}=0\\).\n To see better what this means, we notice that the above detector\ncan be pulled apart into two even simpler mechanisms.\n\nThe first of these is a spatial change or spatial\ndifference detector. This consists of two transducers whose\noutputs without a delay are compared by subtraction. If the two\ninput cells have positions \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), then\nthe quotient \\((I_{2} - I_{1}) / (x_{2} - x_{1})\\) measures the\ndifference in simultaneous values of I over the spatial\ndistance \\(x_{2}-x_{1}\\). This can be written as the derivative \\(dI /\ndx\\). It, and its numerator, are zero iff there is no difference in\n\\(I\\) measured by the two input cells at the same time. The temporal\nvariable \\(t\\) is fixed here. In passing, we can also see a mechanism\nhere for the perception of spatial relations as emphasised\nby Gestalt psychologists.\n\nThe second of these simpler mechanisms is a  temporal change\ndetector. It consists of a single input cell, whose output \\(I_{1}\\)\nat \\(t_{1}\\) is split into two, one of which passes through a delay,\nthen compared with the undelayed signal \\(I_{2}\\) from the next moment\n\\(t_{2}\\). The quotient \\((I_{2}-I_{1}) / (t_{2}-t_{1})\\) measures\nchange in I at a single input over the time period. This can be\nwritten \\(dI / dt\\). This, and its numerator, are zero iff there is no\nchange in the intensities presented to the same cell at different\ntimes. The spatial variable \\(x\\) is fixed here.\n\nThese two mechanisms give ways to register and measure spatial and\ntemporal change. Now it is clear that these two mechanisms, when\ncoupled together, are exactly the original Reichardt detector. But now\nwe can see exactly what that measures. Calculus allows us to write\n\\(dx/dt =(dI/dt)/(dI/dx)\\). But \\(dx/dt\\) is the rate change of\nposition over time, which is speed. Importantly, it is the\nintensity variable \\(I\\) which is fixed here. Thus what this measures\nis how a single intensity, such as that of a moving dot, an\nedge, or a shadow, is varying its spatial position over time. This\nis motion. For a given pair of input cells, the direction of\nthe motion is fixed (different detectors for different directions), so\nwe have a register for velocity.\n\nIn passing, acceleration detection is also straightforward to explain:\nsplit the output from a motion-detector, delay one signal, and\ncompare.\n\nWe can see that the sense in which information about different times\nis compared, is by delaying information from one time. A delay is a\nkind of buffer. Then the information is \u201csuperimposed\u201d on the\ninformation from the next time, by presenting the two informations\ntogether at the one comparator. A \u201ccomposite picture\u201d is obtained by\nsubtracting one from the other. This is conjunction of sorts, since it\nputs two pieces of information together. But it does not obviously\nmake for a state with contradictory content. Indeed, it does not make\nfor a picture of a thing enduring over time, since the same intensity\n\\(I\\) at different place-times might be due to quite unrelated events. But\nthere is more to be said about perceived motion\n\nWe can learn more by considering a family of phenomena known\ncollectively as phi, which is in turn more generally classified\nunder the heading of apparent motion. The simplest example is\nof two intermittently illuminated lights, flashing back-and-forth. We\nnaturally represent it as a single, moving light. This is not\nmere sameness of intensity, but representation as an enduring\nthing. Moreover, it is not surprising that we should evolve to have\nthis response, if we are to successfully track game, or danger,\nthrough intermittent presentations. Or think of a row of lights, as in\na neon sign, with either a single bulb illuminated but its position\nvarying, or a single bulb unilluminated, again with systematically\nvarying position. Or think of a clock dial, with one bulb out, moving\naround the circle. The content of our experience is as an enduring\nsingle thing, having different positions at different times. This is\nthe phi phenomenon. Speed things up (sometimes\ncalled magni-phi), and it ceases to look discrete, instead\npresenting as a continuously moving thing, which enhances the\neffect.\n\nThink of the example of a black dot moving across our visual\nfield. Recalling our general rubric for change at the beginning of\nthis section, we can affirm the first three premisses as statements\nabout the content of our experience: (i) \\(a\\) is at \\(x_{1}\\) at\n\\(t_{1}\\), (ii) \\(b\\) is at \\(x_{2}\\) at \\(t_{2}\\), (iii) if anything\nis at place \\(x_{1}\\) at a time \\(t_{1}\\), then it is not at place\n\\(x_{2}\\) at \\(t_{2}\\). Now add in the content of the phi-experience:\n(iv) \\(a=b\\), and we deduce that \\(a\\) is also not at \\(x_{1}\\) at\n\\(t_{1}\\).\n\nA consistentist about the phenomenology of motion might support (iii)\nand challenge (iv), borrowing from Dharmakirti, or from Lewis\u2019\nperdurance/counterpart account. An alternative consistentist position\nwould be to challenge (iii) and support (iv). In favour of (iii), it\nmight be said that if the moving black dot is slowed down\nsufficiently, and particularly if its positions are discrete, or it\njumps about, then (iii) finds intuitive assent: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) just\nare the sorts of things (events) that occupy distinct places at\ndistinct times. This may be what happens. Again, imagine perception\ncut off after \\(t_{1}\\) but before \\(t_{2}\\) (close the eyes, or\notherwise vanish the dot). Then (iii) holds, the phenomenal dot at\n\\(t_{1}\\) is a distinct existence from a dot at \\(t_{2}\\). Our\ncognitive system responds to stimuli both as events, where (iii)\nholds; and as enduring objects, where (iv) holds. If nothing moves,\nthen there is no contradiction, but when we see motion, the\nobject-recognition mechanism identifies distinct things at different\ntimes and so a contradictory content is born. That, I suspect, is the\nphenomenological content of motion.\n\n\nThis model has a number of features, which are only briefly summarised\nhere. A now box is postulated, distinguished by its distinctive\nmulti-modal inputs and outputs. Information enters the now box and is\nretained for a brief time, the \u201cspecious\npresent\u201d. Dismissal from the now box cannot be instantaneous,\nbut takes some time to \u201cfade\u201d or reduce in intensity. Thus\nthe now contains new contents and fading, older contents; and a\nnatural direction of time. The delay and comparisons of Reichardt\ndetectors are enlisted in this process. The endurance or persistence\nof contents suggests an account of apparent motion, phi or beta, in\nwhich identical states close in time and space but not identical, are\ncounted as identical. The important thing for our purposes is that the\nidentity of different and changing temporal stages of a perceptual\nprocess (the perceived moving dot), gives the necessary premiss for\ninconsistency, as discussed earlier.\n\nIn passing, this model gives natural accounts of akinetopsia, and of\nthe \u201cmoving now\u201d. Akinetopsia, that is motion blindness,\nhas a \u201cstop-start\u201d phenomenology where a thing is\nperceived as distant, then suddenly up close, without any awareness of\nthe in-between. This suggests that something has gone wrong with the\nfade mechanism, and the contents of the now do not fade, but persist\nfull strength for a time, crowding out new updates. Eventually it\ncollapses, and then no in-between has been registered. As for the\nmoving now, it is noted that the contents of the now change over time,\nbut it seems to the experiencer as if the now is a single thing\npersisting or enduring over time, and moving from event to\nevent. These matters are expanded on in Mortensen (2013). \n\nAn independent account of the flow of time, with striking similarities\nis to be found in Gruber, Bach and Block (2015). The flow of time has\ntwo levels of explanation, and is described as an\n\u201cillusion\u201d insofar as experience is in conflict with\nmeasurement (compare Muller-Lyer). It would appear that the levels,\nupper and lower, correspond to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) concepts respectively,\nso that the upper level, the passage of time, is an illusion. The\nauthors postulate two mechanisms, perceptual completion and object\npersistence, to account for the flow of time. Perceptual completion\ninvolves adding to an experience to complete it some way, for example\napparent motion, that is phi or beta. Object persistence requires that\nan object be perceived as the same (thing) now as it was then. It is\nessentially the same mechanism that identifies an object at a time,\nwith itself at a later time. This is conceptually necessary for an\norder of past/present/future, the \\(A\\) series. This account also has\na specious present or now, which is similar to our now box.\n\nWe cannot hope to do justice to this complex paper here. However,\nfocussing on the theme of inconsistency, one question that could be\nasked is how much these mechanisms, perceptual completion and object\npersistence, are really different, as against being species of the\nsame genus. It would seem that the illusion is pervasive because of\nthe mechanism of identification of earlier/later stages. But this is\nwhat we saw was sufficient for contradiction. If these models of\nmotion perception are right, it follows that contradiction is\npervasive in our experience as the phenomenology of change, which is\nto say, everywhere.\n9. Conclusion\n \n\nThere remain many loose ends from our discussion.
