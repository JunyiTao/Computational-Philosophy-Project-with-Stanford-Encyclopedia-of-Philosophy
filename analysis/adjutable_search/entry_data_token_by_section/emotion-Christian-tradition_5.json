    "main_text": "Some Christian emotions || Contrition\n3.2 Contrition\n\nNext, consider contrition. Again, we can get a good idea of the\nqualities and actions that this emotion attributes to God by\nconsidering a prayer from the Book of Common Prayer (in this\nemotion, much of what the believer attributes she attributes to\nherself; however, attributes of God, such as God\u2019s holiness and\nstatus as judge, and God\u2019s redeeming action, are essential posits of\nthe believer\u2019s construal):\n\nAlmighty God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Maker of all things,\nJudge of all men; we acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and\nwickedness, which we, from time to time, most grievously have\ncommitted, by thought, word, and deed, against thy Divine Majesty,\nprovoking most justly thy wrath and indignation against us. We do\nearnestly repent, and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings; the\nremembrance of them is grievous unto us; the burden of them is\nintolerable. Have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, most merciful\nFather; For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ\u2019s sake, forgive us all that\nis past\u2026 (p. 73).\n\n\nThis emotion again fits very well Schleiermacher\u2019s characterization of\nreligious emotion as a \u201cself-consciousness,\u201d but it is at\nthe same time, as Otto suggests, a consciousness of a God who has\ndefinite, positive features. Salient in the consciousness of the\ncontrite person are her misdoings and her sullied moral status before\nthe divine judge. Contrary to Otto\u2019s isolation of religious experience\nfrom ethics, in contrition God is thought of as an eminently moral\nfigure. But if we take this prayer as canonical for the emotion, then\nboth the notion of God as creator (opening sentence) and Otto\u2019s\nprivileged attribute of the divine majesty are also in the believer\u2019s\nconstrual of God, though they seem to be less salient than the\nattribute of moral judge. Another attribute that is very much in the\ncontent of Christian contrition is God\u2019s mercy. Thus a serenity and\nhonesty about the grievousness and intolerable burden of sin are\ncharacteristic of contrition that are not characteristic of a plain\nfeeling of guilt. The contrite believer feels herself, in her sin, to\nbe welcomed and embraced by a loving and forgiving God, a merciful\nFather.\n",
