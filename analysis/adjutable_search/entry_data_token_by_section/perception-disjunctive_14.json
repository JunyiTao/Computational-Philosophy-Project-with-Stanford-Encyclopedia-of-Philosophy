    "main_text": "Objections to Disjunctivism || The Causal Argument Against Disjunctivism\n4.2 The Causal Argument Against Disjunctivism\n\n\nAn influential argument against disjunctivism is the causal\nargument, first proposed by Howard Robinson (see Robinson 1985 and\n1994). The simplest version of the argument appeals to the following\ntwo claims: (i) It is theoretically possible, by activating some brain\nprocesses involved when a subject genuinely perceives the world, to\ncause a hallucination subjectively indistinguishible from that\nperception\u2014a \u2018causally matching\u2019 hallucination.\n(ii) It is necessary to give the same account of the experiences\ninvolved in genuine perception and hallucination when they have the\nsame neural causes. So we should accept that the kind of\nexperience that occurs when a subject perceives the world is one the\nsubject could be having if she were hallucinating.\n\n\nThe general principle behind this second claim is \u2018same\nproximate cause, same immediate effect\u2019. It is likely that the\ndisjunctivist will simply reject this principle. The disjunctivist may\ninsist that in a case of genuine perception, even if the objects of\nperception are distal causes of the subject\u2019s experience, they\nare also figure non-causally as essential constituents of it. So the\noccurrence of the relevant brain processes won\u2019t be sufficient to\nproduce the kind of mental event involved in perception, unless further\nnon-causal conditions necessary for the occurrence of that kind of\nmental effect also obtain. At this point, the disjunctivist and her\nopponent may simply disagree as to whether there are any psychological\neffects that have significant non-causal constitutive conditions\nattached. And this connects with familiar debates as to the tenability\nof externalist views in the philosophy of mind. (For further discussion\nof the causal argument see Langsam 1997, Snowdon 2005b, and Martin\n2004).\n",
