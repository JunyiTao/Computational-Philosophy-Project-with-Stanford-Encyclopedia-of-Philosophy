    "main_text": "Montaigne\u2019s Legacy from Charron to Hobbes\n6. Montaigne\u2019s Legacy from Charron to Hobbes\n\n  Pierre Charron was Montaigne\u2019s friend and official heir. In De\nla sagesse (1601 and 1604), he re-organized many of his master\u2019s\nideas, setting aside the most disturbing ones. His work is now usually\ndismissed as a dogmatic misrepresentation of Montaigne\u2019s\nthought. Nevertheless, his book was given priority over the\nEssays themselves during the whole XVIIth century, especially\nafter Malebranche\u2019s critics conspired to have the Essays\nincluded in the Roman Index of 1677.  Montaigne\u2019s historical influence\nmust be reckoned through the lens of this mediation.  Moreover,\nCharron\u2019s reading is not simply faulty. According to him, wisdom\nrelies on the readiness of judgment to revise itself towards a more\nfavorable\n outcome:[55]\n this idea is one of the most remarkable readings of the\nEssays in the early history of their reception. \n\nThe critical conception of the essay was taken up by the English\nscientist and philosopher Francis Bacon, who considered his own Essays\nas \u201cfragments of [his] conceits\u201d and \u201cdispersed meditations\u201d, aiming\nto stimulate the reader\u2019s appetite for thinking and knowledge rather\nthan satisfying it with expositions of dogmas and \nmethods.[56]\n Even in his more scientific works, such as The Advancement of\nLearning, Bacon\u2019s writing was inconclusive. He posited that this open\nand fragmentary style was the best way to inspire further thought and\nexamination: \u201cAphorisms, representing a knowledge broken, do invite\nmen to inquire \n further\u201d.[57]\n Bacon\u2019s reflections allow us to appreciate\nthe scientific value of Montaigne\u2019s Essays, insofar as they are\nincomplete works, always calling for subsequent reflections by the\nauthor and the reader, thus inspiring and promoting the development of\nideas and the advancement of research.\n\n  The influence Montaigne had on Descartes has been commented upon by\nmany critics, at least from the XIXth century on, within the context of\nthe birth of modern science. As a sceptic, calling into question the\nnatural link between mind and things, Montaigne would have won his\nposition in the modern philosophical landscape.  The\nscepticism in the \u201cApologie\u201d is, no doubt, a main source\nof \u201csolipsism\u201d, but Descartes cannot be called a disciple\nof Montaigne in the sense that he would have inherited a\ndoctrine. Above all, he owes the P\u00e9rigourdin gentleman a way of\neducating himself. Far from substituting Montaigne for his Jesuit\nschoolteachers, Descartes decided to teach himself from scratch,\nfollowing the path indicated by Montaigne to achieve independence and\nfirmness of judgment. The mindset that Descartes inherited from the\nEssays appears as something particularly obvious, in the two\nfirst parts of the Discours de la m\u00e9thode. As the\nyoung Descartes left the Coll\u00e8ge de La Fl\u00e8che, he\ndecided to travel, and to test his own value in action. \u201cI\nemployed the rest of my youth to travel, to see courts and armies, to\nmeet people of varied humors and conditions, to collect varied\nexperiences, to try myself in the meetings that fortune was offering\n me (\u2026).\u201d[58]\n  Education, taken out of a school context, is presented as an essay\nof the self through experience. The world, as pedagogue, has been\nsubstituted for books and teachers. This new education allows\nDescartes to get rid of the prejudice of overrating his own customs, a\nwidespread phenomenon that we now call ethnocentrism. Montaigne\u2019s\nlegacy becomes particularly conspicuous when Descartes draws the\nlesson from his travels, \u201chaving acknowledged that those who have\nvery contrary feelings to ours are not barbarians or savages, but that\nmany of them make use of reason as much or more so than we\ndo\u201d. And also : \u201cIt is good to know something of different\npeople, in order to judge our own with more sanity, and not to think\nthat everything that is against our customs and habits is ridiculous\nand against reason, as usually do those who have never seen\n anything.\u201d[59]\n Like Montaigne, Descartes begins by philosophizing on life with no\nother device than the a discipline of judgment: \u201cI was\nlearning not to believe anything too firmly, of which I had been\npersuaded through example and\n custom.\u201d[60]\n He departs nevertheless from Montaigne when he will equate with error\nopinions that are grounded on\n custom.[61]\n The latter would not have dared to speak of error: varied opinions,\nhaving more or less authority, are to be weighed upon the scale of\njudgment. It is thus not correct to interpret Montaigne\u2019s philosophy\nas a \u201ccriticism of prejudice\u201d from a Cartesian\nstance. \n\nIn recent years, critics have stressed the importance of the\nconnection between Montaigne and Hobbes for the development of a\nmodern vision of politics, rooted in a criticism of traditional\ndoctrines of man and society. At the time when Shakespeare was writing\nhis plays, the first English translation of\nMontaigne\u2019s Essays by John Florio (1603) became a widely-read\nclassic in England. As a former student of Magdalen Hall (Oxford) and\nSaint John\u2019s College (Cambridge), and as a young tutor and secretary\nto aristocratic and wealthy families, Thomas Hobbes had many\nopportunities to read Montaigne in the libraries he frequented. In his\ncapacity as tutor, he traveled widely in Europe and spent several\nsojourns in France, before the English Civil War forced him into exile\nin Paris (1641\u20131651). During this period, Hobbes moved in skeptical\nand libertine circles and met scholars such as Sorbi\u00e8re, Gassendi, and\nLa Mothe Le Vayer, all influenced by a shared reference to Montaigne\u2019s\nskepticism. Historical documents and comparative research confirm the\nrelevance of Montaigne\u2019s influence on Hobbes\u2019s work, from Elements\nof Law to \n Leviathan.[62]\n The two authors share a\nphilosophical conception of man as driven by desire and imagination,\nand relentlessly striving for self-conservation and power. Montaigne\nidentified human life with movement and instability, and pointed to\nthe power that our passions have to push us toward imaginary future\naccomplishments (honor, glory, science, reason, and so \n on).[63]\n In Leviathan, Hobbes builds on this position to assert, as\na general inclination of all mankind, \u201ca perpetual and restless desire\nof power after power, that ceases only in \n death\u201d.[64]\n This shared\nanthropology shows the extent to which Montaigne and Hobbes refute the\nScholastic and Renaissance anthropocentric idea of man as a rational\nbeing at the summit of creation. On the contrary, they underline his\ninstinctive and passionate nature, which eventually leads to violence\nand conflict wherever the political community collapses. This negative\nanthropology is to be understood in the light of the historical\nexperience of the civil wars upsetting both their \n countries.[65]\n The threat of political turmoil imbued both Montaigne and Hobbes\u2019\nlives. Whereas Hobbes quoted the ancient saying homo homini\nlupus, and described the human condition outside the civil state\nas a war \u201cwhere every man is enemy to every\n man\u201d,[66]\n Montaigne seemed to\ngo further, \u201chaving learned by experience, from the cruelty of some\nChristians, that there is no beast in the world to be feared by man as\n man\u201d.[67]\n In order to avoid the outburst of violence, they both recognize\nthe necessity of laws and obedience, a necessity that does not rely on\nany ontological or moral foundation. The normative force of law\nresults from its practical necessity, as it is the rational condition\nof life in\n society.[68]\n As Montaigne wrote: \u201cNow laws remain in credit\nnot because they are just, but because they are\n laws\u201d.[69]\n Questioning the Aristotelian vision of politics as a natural goal for humanity,\nMontaigne and Hobbes pointed out the man-made nature of civil\nauthority, as founded in the need to preserve life and peace, avoiding\nviolence and war.\n",
