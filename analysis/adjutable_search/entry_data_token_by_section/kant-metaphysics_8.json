    "main_text": "God and Rational Theology\n5. God and Rational Theology\n\nThe metaphysical drive, and the demand for the unconditioned, seem to\nfind their natural resting place in the idea of God, an absolutely\nnecessary and supremely real being, the concept of which\n\u201ccontains a therefore for every wherefore\u201d (A585/B613). It\nis here, in the concept of God, that the demands for systematic unity\nand completeness of knowledge find their \u201cobjective\ncorrelate.\u201d Kant refers to this idea as an Ideal, suggesting it\ndefines itself as a \u201cconcept of an individual object which is\ncompletely determined through the mere idea\u201d (A574/B602). The\nIdeal represents the highest singular manifestation of reason\u2019s\ndemand for the unconditioned.\n\nThe last area of metaphysics under attack, then, is Rational Theology.\nKant\u2019s criticism of rational theology is complicated by his\ndesire to elucidate the sources of the dialectical errors,\nwhich he will expose in relation to the specific arguments for\nGod\u2019s existence. (\u201c\u2026Merely to describe the\nprocedure of our reason and its dialectic does not suffice; we must\nalso endeavor to discover the sources of this dialectic, that we may\nexplain\u2026the illusion to which it has given rise\u201d\n(A581/B607).) Kant thus spends a considerable amount of time tracing\nthe idea of God back to its rational, speculative, sources. According\nto Kant, \u201c\u2026.the Ideal \u2026is based on a natural, not\na merely arbitrary idea\u201d (A581/B607). On this score, Kant wants\nto tell us that we are compelled to think the idea of God (the ens\nrealissimum) when pursuing certain speculative or philosophical\ninterests. More specifically, the idea of a supremely real being (the\nens realissimum) is one to which we are inevitably led during\nour attempts to account for the pure possibility of things in general.\nThe upshot that the idea of the ens realissimum is not an\narbitrary or easily dispensable one. Instead, Kant suggests that\nreason is philosophically constrained to move to such an idea in its\nefforts to thoroughly determine every thing. Such efforts require\nthinking the totality, or \u201cAll\u201d of reality (the\nomnitudo realitatis). Such an idea is philosophically\nrequired because, in our efforts to thoroughly determine each thing\n(to know it completely, specify it exhaustively), we must be able to\nsay, of every possible predicate and its contradictory (p v\n\u02dcp) which of the two holds of the thing in question.\n(For every object, it is either A or not A, either\nB or not B, etc., and this process is iterated until\neach predicate pair (each positive reality) is exhausted \u2014 Kant\nclearly has a Leibnizian procedure of complete determination in mind\nhere.) This process is parasitic upon the idea of \u201csum total of\nall predicates of things in general.\u201d Or, put in another way, we\nrepresent \u201cevery thing as deriving its own possibility from the\nshare it has in the whole of possibility\u201d (A572/B600). Such an\nidea, the All of reality, however, defines itself as an individual\nthing, and leads us to the representation of the \u201csupremely real\nbeing.\u201d The problem seems to come in, according to Kant, when\nthe \u201cAll\u201d of reality gets hypostatized, and (eventually)\npersonified, thus yielding the ens realissimum (cf.\nA583/B611n). Here again, Kant thinks that this idea itself gets\ntransmuted into the notion of a given object by virtue of a unique\nsubreption, whereby we dialectically substitute for a principle that\nis only meant for empirical employment one which holds of things in\ngeneral. The argument Kant offers is excruciating, but the essential\npoint is that, just as the idea of the soul involved the subreption of\nthe hypostatized consciousness, so too, the idea of the ens\nrealissimum is generated by both a subrepted principle and a\nhypostatization.\n\nAs in the cases of both rational psychology and rational cosmology,\nthen, one central problem thus has to do with the assumption that pure\n(speculative) reason yields any access to a transcendent object (in\nthis case, God) about which it is entitled to seek a priori\nknowledge. Despite his insistence that the idea of God is\nindispensable and \u201cinescapable\u201d (cf. A584/B612), Kant\nagain denies that we can acquire any theoretical knowledge of the\nalleged \u201cobject\u201d thought through such an idea. On the one\nhand, then, the idea of God is \u201cthe crown of our\nendeavors.\u201d On the other, as in the cases of both rational\npsychology and cosmology, the idea answers to no given and\ntheoretically knowable object (A339/B397). Indeed, according to Kant,\nthe idea of God should not lead us to \u201cpresuppose the existence\nof a being that corresponds to this ideal, but only the idea of such a\nbeing, and this only for the purpose of deriving from an unconditioned\ntotality of complete determination the conditioned totality. i.e., the\nlimited\u2026\u201d (A578/B606). As in the other disciplines of\nmetaphysics, Kant suggests that we are motivated (perhaps even\nconstrained) to represent the idea as a real object, to hypostatize\nit, in accordance the demand for the unconditioned:\n\nNotwithstanding this pressing need of reason to presuppose something\nthat may afford the understanding a sufficient foundation for the\ncomplete determination of its concepts, it is yet too easily conscious\nof the ideal and merely fictitious character of such a presuppostion\nto allow itself, on this ground alone, to be persuaded that a mere\ncreature of its own thought is a real being \u2014 were it not that\nit is impelled from another direction to seek a resting place in the\nregress from the conditioned, which is given, to the unconditioned\n(A584/B612)\n\n\nThis demand for the unconditioned, according to Kant, links up with a\ndemand for some ultimately necessary being. Reason, that is,\nceaselessly demands the ground of all the contingent beings in\nexistence, and will not rest until it settles on the absolutely\nnecessary being which grounds them. The idea of the ens\nrealissimum plays a singular role in satisfying this desire of\nreason, for of all concepts, it is that \u201cwhich best squares with\nthe concept of an unconditionally necessary being\u201d (A586/B614).\nIn fact, according to Kant rational theology is based on the\ncoincidence of the rational demands for a supremely real being and for\na being with absolutely necessary existence. If the movement to the\nidea of God, as the unconditioned ground, is inevitable, it is\nnevertheless as troublesome as the other rational ideas:\n\nThis unconditioned is not, indeed, given as being in itself real, nor\nas having a reality that follows from its mere concept; it is,\nhowever, what alone can complete the series of conditions when we\nproceed to trace these conditions to their grounds. This is the course\nwhich our human reason, by its very nature, leads all of us\n(A584/B612; cf. A584/B612n).\n\n\nThus, although Kant is most well known for his attacks on the specific\narguments for God\u2019s existence, his criticisms of rational\ntheology are in fact more detailed, and involve a robust critique of\nthe idea of God itself. This account of the rational origin and the\nimportance of the idea of God clears the way for Kant\u2019s\nrejection of the metaphysical arguments about God\u2019s existence.\nKant identifies three traditional arguments, the ontological, the\ncosmological, and the physico-theological (the argument from design).\nWhat all such arguments do is attempt to wed the idea of the ens\nrealissimum with the notion of necessary existence. Whereas the\nOntological argument moves from the concept of the ens\nrealissimum to the claim that such a being exists\nnecessarily, the Cosmological and physico-theological arguments move\nfrom some necessary being to the conclusion that such a being\nmust be the ens realissimum.\n",
