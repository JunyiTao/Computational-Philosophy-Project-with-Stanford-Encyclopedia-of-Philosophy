    "main_text": "Modern Philosophy\n4. Modern Philosophy\n\n\nEurope experienced a second Renaissance when scholars fled\nConstantinople after its capture by the Muslims in 1453, and brought\nwith them Greek manuscripts that were previously inaccessible. In\nFlorence Marsilio Ficino (1433\u201399) identified Plato as the\nprimary ancient teacher of wisdom, and (like Bonaventure) cited\nAugustine as his guide in elevating Plato in this way. His choice of\nPlato was determined by the harmony he believed to exist between\nPlato's thought and the Christian faith, and he set about making Latin\ntranslations of all the Platonic texts so that this wisdom could be\navailable for his contemporaries who did not know Greek. He was also\nthe first Latin translator of Plotinus, the Neo-Platonist.\n\n\nMany of the central figures in the Reformation were humanists in the\nRenaissance sense (where there is no implication of atheism). But\nthere is also a fundamental similarity in the way the relation between\nmorality and religion is conceived between Scotus and the two\nReformers Martin Luther (1483\u20131546) and John Calvin\n(1509\u201364), though neither of them make the distinctions about\nnatural law that Scotus (the \u2018subtle doctor\u2019) does. Luther\nsays \u2018What God wills is not right because he ought or was bound\nso to will; on the contrary, what takes place must be right, because\nhe so wills.\u2019 (Bondage of the Will, Works,\npp. 195\u20136). Calvin says \u2018God's will is so much the highest\nrule of righteousness that whatever he wills, by the very fact that he\nwills it, must be considered righteous\u2019 (Institutes\n3. 23. 2). The historical connection between Scotus and the Reformers\ncan be traced through William of Ockham (d. 1349) and Gabriel Biel\n(1410\u201395). The Counter-Reformation in Roman Catholic Europe, on\nthe other hand, took the work of Aquinas as authoritative for\neducation. Francisco de Suarez (1548\u20131617) claimed that the\nprecepts of natural law can be distinguished into those (like\n\u2018Do good and avoid evil\u2019) which are known immediately and\nintuitively by all normal human beings, those (like \u2018Do no\ninjury to anyone\u2019) which require experience and thought to know\nthem, but which are then self-evident, and those (like \u2018Lying is\nalways immoral\u2019) which are not self-evident but can be derived\nfrom the more basic precepts (De Legibus, 2. 7. 5). However,\nSuarez accepted Scotus's double account of motivation.\n\n\nThe next two centuries in European philosophy can be described in\nterms of two lines of development, rationalism and empiricism, both of\nwhich led, in different ways, to the possibility of a greater\ndetachment of ethics from theology. The history of rationalism from\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) is a history of re-establishing human knowledge on\nthe foundation of rational principles that could not be doubted, after\nmodern science started to shake the traditional foundations supported\nby the authority of Greek philosophy and the church. Descartes was not\nprimarily an ethicist, but he located the source of moral law\n(surprisingly for a rationalist) in God's will. The most important\nrationalist in ethics was Benedict de Spinoza (1623\u201377). He was\na Jew, but was condemned by his contemporary faith community as\nunorthodox. Like Descartes, he attempted to duplicate the methods of\ngeometry in philosophy. Substance, according to Spinoza, exists in\nitself and is conceived through itself (Ethics, I, def. 3);\nit is consequently one, infinite, and identical with God\n(Ethics, I, prop. 15). There is no such thing as natural law,\nsince all events in nature (\u2018God or Nature\u2019) are equally\nnatural. Everything in the universe is necessary, and there is no free\nwill, except in as far as Spinoza is in favor of calling someone free\nwho is led by reason ( Ethics, I, prop. 32). Each human mind\nis a limited aspect of the divine intellect. On this view (which has\nits antecedent in Stoicism) the human task is to move towards the\ngreatest possible rational control of human life. Leibniz was, like\nDescartes, not primarily an ethicist. He said, however, that\n\u2018the highest perfection of any thinking being lies in careful\nand constant pursuit of true happiness\u2019 (New Essays on Human\nUnderstanding, XXI, 51). The rationalists were not denying the\ncentrality of God in human moral life, but their emphasis was on the\naccess we have through the light of reason rather than through sacred\ntext or ecclesiastical authority.\n\n\nAfter Leibniz there was in Germany a long-running battle between the\nrationalists and the pietists, who tried to remain true to the goals\nof the Lutheran Reformation. Examples of the two schools are Christian\nWolff (1679\u20131754) and Christian August Crusius (1715\u201375),\nand we can understand Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804), like his\nteacher Martin Knutzen (1713\u201351), as trying to mediate between\nthe two. Wolff was a very successful popularizer of the thought of\nLeibniz, but fuller in his ethical system. He took from Leibniz the\nprinciple that we will always select what pleases us most, and the\nprinciple that pleasure is the apprehension of perfection, so that the\namount of pleasure we feel is proportional to the amount of perfection\nwe intuit (New Essays on Human Understanding, XXI, 41). He\nthought we are obligated to do what will make us and our condition, or\nthat of others, more perfect, and this is the law of nature that would\nbe binding on us even if (per impossible) God did not\nexist. He saw no problem about the connection between virtue and\nhappiness, since both of them result directly from our perfection, and\nno problem about the connection between virtue and duty, since a duty\nis simply an act in accordance with law, which prescribes the pursuit\nof perfection. His views were offensive to the pietists, because he\nclaimed that Confucius already knew (by reason) all that mattered\nabout morality, even though he did not know anything about\nChrist. Crusius by contrast accepted Scotus's double theory of\nmotivation, and held that there are actions that we ought to do\nregardless of any ends we have, even the end of our own perfection and\nhappiness. It is plausible to see here the origin of Kant's\ncategorical imperative. But he also added a third motivation, what he\ncalled \u2018the drive of conscience\u2019 which is \u2018the\nnatural drive to recognize a divine moral law\u2019 (\u201cA Guide\nto Rational Living,\u201d\nMoral Philosophy from Montaigne to Kant, \u00a7132, 574). His idea\nwas that we have within us this separate capacity to recognize divine\ncommand and to be drawn towards it out of a sense of dependence on the\nGod who prescribes the command to us, and will punish us if we disobey\n(though our motive should not be to avoid punishment) (Ibid.,\n\u00a7135). \n\n\nThe history of empiricism in Britain from Hobbes to Hume is also the\nhistory of the attempt to re-establish human knowledge, but not from\nabove (from indubitable principles of reason) but from below (from\nexperience and especially the experience of the senses). Thomas Hobbes\n(1588\u20131649) said that all reality is bodily (including God), and\nall events are motions in space. Willing, then, is a motion, and is\nmerely the last act of desire or aversion in any process of\ndeliberation. His view is that it is natural, and so reasonable, for\neach of us to aim solely at our own preservation or pleasure. In the\nstate of nature, humans are selfish, and their lives are\n\u2018solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u2019, a war of all\nagainst all (Leviathan, Ch. 13). The first precept of the law\nof nature is then for each of us, pursuing our own interest, \u2018to\nendeavor peace, as far as he has hope of attaining it; and when he\ncannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps, and advantages\nof war.\u2019 (Ibid., Ch. 14). The second precept is that\neach of us should be willing to lay down our natural rights to\neverything to the extent that others are also willing, and Hobbes\nconcludes with the need to subordinate ourselves to a sovereign who\nalone will be able to secure peace. The second and longest portion\nof Leviathan is devoted to religion, where Hobbes argues for\nthe authority of Scripture (\u2018God's word\u2019), which he thinks\nis needed for the authority of law. He argues for the authority in\nthe interpretation of Scripture to be given to that same\nearthly sovereign, and not to competing ecclesiastical authorities\n(whose competition had been seen to exacerbate the miseries of war\nboth in Britain and on the continent) (Ibid., Ch. 33).\n\n\nJohn Locke (1632\u20131704) followed Hobbes in deriving morality from\nour need to live together in peace given our natural discord, but he\ndenied that we are mechanically moved by our desires. He agreed with\nHobbes in saying that moral laws are God's imposition, but disagreed\nby making God's power and benevolence both necessary\nconditions for God's authority in this respect (Treatises,\nIV. XIII. 3). He also held that our reason can work out counsels or\nadvice about moral matters; but only God's imposition makes\nlaw (and hence obligation), and we only know about God's\nimposition from revelation (The Reasonableness of\nChristianity, 62\u20135). He therefore devoted considerable attention\nto justifying our belief in the reliability of revelation.\n\n\nThe deists (e.g., William Wollaston, 1659\u20131724) believed that\nhumans can reason from their experience of nature to the existence and\nsome of the attributes of God, that special revelation is accordingly\nunnecessary, that God does not intervene in human affairs (after\ncreation) and that the good life for humans finds adequate guidance in\nphilosophical ethics. Frances Hutcheson (1694\u20131746) was not a\ndeist, but does give a reading of the sort of guidance involved\nhere. He distinguished between objects that are naturally good, which\nexcite personal or selfish pleasure, and those that are morally good,\nwhich are advantageous to all persons affected. He took\nhimself to be giving a reading of moral goodness as agape,\nthe Greek word for the love of our neighbor that Jesus\nprescribes. This love is benevolence, Hutcheson said, and it is\nformulated in the principle \u2018That Action is best, which procures\nthe greatest Happiness for the greatest Numbers\u2019\n(Inquiry II, III, VIII). Because these definitions of natural\nand moral good produce a possible gap between the two, we need some\nway to believe that morality and happiness are coincident. Hutcheson\nthought that God has given us a moral sense for this purpose\n(Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions, II). This\nmoral sense responds to examples of benevolence with approbation and a\nunique kind of pleasure, and benevolence is the only thing it responds\nto, as it were the only signal it picks up. It is, like Scotus's\naffection for justice, not confined to our perception of\nadvantage. The result of our having moral sense is that when intending\nthe good of others, we \u2018undesignedly\u2019 end up promoting our\nown greatest good as well because we end up gratifying ourselves along\nwith others. God shows benevolence by first making us\nbenevolent and then giving us this moral sense that gets joy from the\napprobation of our benevolence. To contemporary British opponents of\nmoral sense theory, this seemed too rosy or benign a picture; our joy\nin approving benevolence is not enough to make morality and happiness\ncoincident. We need also obligation and divine sanction.\n\n\nJoseph Butler (1692\u20131752, Bishop of Bristol and then of Durham)\nheld that God's goodness consists in benevolence, in wanting us to be\nhappy, and that we should want the same for each other. He made the\nimportant point that something can be good for an agent because it is\nwhat he wants without this meaning that the content of what\nhe wants has anything to do with himself (Fifteen Sermons,\n126\u201327).\n\n\nDavid Hume (1711\u201376) is the first figure in this narrative who\ncan properly be attached to the Enlightenment, though this term means\nvery different things in Scotland, in France and in Germany. Hume held\nthat reason cannot command or move the human will. Since morals\nclearly do have an influence on actions and affections, \u2018it\nfollows that they cannot be derived from reason; and that because\nreason alone, as we have already proved, can never have any such\ninfluence\u2019 (Treatise III.1). For Hume an action, or\nsentiment, or character, is virtuous or vicious \u2018because its\nview causes a pleasure or uneasiness of a particular kind\u2019\n(Ibid., III.2). The denial of motive power to reason is part\nof his general skepticism. He accepted from Locke the principle that\nour knowledge is restricted to sense impressions from experience and\nlogically necessary relations of ideas in advance of experience (in\nLatin, a priori). From this principle he derived more radical\nconclusions than Locke had done. For example, we cannot know about\ncausation or the soul. The only thing we can know about morals is that\nwe get pleasure from the thought of some things and pain from the\nthought of others. Since the idea of morality implies something\nuniversal, there must be some sentiment of sympathy or (he later says)\nhumanity, which is common to all human beings, and which\n\u2018recommends the same object to general approbation\u2019\n(Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,\nIX. I. 221). Hume thought we could get conventional moral conclusions\nfrom these moral sentiments, which nature has fortunately given us. He\nwas also skeptical about any attempt to derive conclusions containing\n\u2018ought\u2019 from premises containing only \u2018is\u2019,\nthough scholars debate about the scope of the premises he is talking\nabout here. Probably he included premises about God's will or nature\nor action. This does not mean he was arguing against the existence of\nGod. He thought (like Calvin) that we cannot rely on rational proofs\nof God's existence, even though humans have what Calvin called a sense\nof the divine and Human called \u2018true religion\u2019. But Hume\nnever identified himself as an atheist, though he had opportunity in\nthe atheist circles he frequented in Paris, and his Dialogues on\nNatural Religion end with the sentiment that \u2018to be a\nphilosophical skeptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most\nessential step towards being a sound, believing Christian\u2019\n(Dialogues, part XII, penultimate paragraph). Some scholars\ntake this remark (like similar statements in Hobbes) as purely ironic,\nbut this goes beyond the evidence.\n\n\nThe Enlightenment in France had a more anti-clerical flavor (in part\nbecause of the history of Jansenism, unique to France), and for the\nfirst time in this narrative we meet genuine atheists, such as Baron\nd'Holbach (1723\u201389) who held not only that morality did not need\nreligion, but that religion, and especially Christianity, was its\nmajor impediment. Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Voltaire (1694-1778) was,\nespecially towards the end of his life, opposed to Christianity, but\nnot to religion in general (Letters of Voltaire and Frederick the\nGreat, letter 156). He accepted from the English deists the idea\nthat what is true in Christian teachings is the core of human values\nthat are universally true in all religions, and (like the German\nrationalists) he admired Confucius. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-78)\nsaid, famously, that mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in\nchains (The Social Contract, Ch. 1). This supposes a\ndisjunction between nature and contemporary society, and Rousseau held\nthat the life of primitive human beings was happy inasmuch as they\nknew how to live in accordance with their own innate needs; now we\nneed some kind of social contract to protect us from the corrupting\neffects of society upon the proper love of self. Nature is understood\nas the whole realm of being created by God, who guarantees its\ngoodness, unity, and order. Rousseau held that we do not need any\nintermediary between us and God, and we can attain salvation by\nreturning to nature in this high sense and by developing all our\nfaculties harmoniously. Our ultimate happiness is to feel ourselves at\none with the system that God created.\n\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) is the most important figure of the\nEnlightenment in Germany, but his project is different in many ways\nfrom those of his French contemporaries. He was brought up in a\npietist Lutheran family, and his system retains many features from,\nfor example, Crusius. But he was also indebted through Wolff to\nLeibniz. Moreover, he was \u2018awoken from his dogmatic\nslumbers\u2019 by reading Hume, though Kant is referring here to\nHume's attack on causation, not his ethical theory\n(Prolegomena, 4:260). Kant's mature project was to limit\nhuman knowledge \u2018in order to make room for faith\u2019\n(KrV, B xxx). He accepted from Hume that our knowledge is\nconfined within the limits of possible sense experience, but he did\nnot accept skeptical conclusions about causation or the soul. Reason\nis not confined, in his view, to the same limits as knowledge, and we\nare rationally required to hold beliefs about things as they are in\nthemselves, not merely things as they appear to us. In particular, we\nare required to believe in God, freedom and immortality. These are\nthree \u2018postulates of practical reason\u2019, required to make\nrational sense of the fact of moral obligation, the fact that we are\nunder the moral law (the \u2018categorical imperative\u2019) that\nrequires us to will the maxim of an action (the prescription of the\naction together with the reason for it) as a universal law (removing\nany self-preference) and to treat humanity in any person as always at\nthe same time an end and never merely as a means (Groundwork,\n4.421, 429). Kant thought that humans have to be able to believe that\nmorality in this demanding form is consistent in the long run with\nhappiness (both their own and that of the people they affect by their\nactions), if they are going to be able to persevere in the moral life\nwithout rational instability. He did not accept the three\ntraditional theoretical arguments for the existence of God\n(though he was sympathetic to a modest version of the teleological\nargument). But the practical argument was decisive for him,\nthough he held that it was possible to be morally good without being a\ntheist, despite such a position being rationally unstable.\n\n\nIn Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason he undertook\nthe project of using moral language in order to translate the four\nmain themes of Biblical revelation (accessible only to particular\npeople at particular times) into the revelation to Reason (accessible\nto all people at all times). This does not mean that he intended to\nreduce Biblical faith to morality, though some scholars have taken him\nthis way. The translated versions of Creation, Fall, Redemption and\nSecond Coming are as follows (see Hare 1996): Humans have an initial\npredisposition to the good, which is essential to them, but is\noverlaid with a propensity to evil, which is not essential to\nthem. Since they are born under \u2018the Evil Maxim\u2019 that\nsubordinates duty to happiness, they are unable by their own devices\nto reverse this ranking, and require \u2018an effect of grace\u2019\n(Religion, 6.53). Providence ushers in progress (though not\ncontinuous) towards an \u2018ethical commonwealth\u2019 in which we\ntogether make the moral law our own law, by appropriating it as\nauthoritative for our own lives (this is what Kant means by\n\u2018autonomy\u2019) (Religion, 6.98\u201399;\nGroundwork, 4.433\u201334). \n\n\nA whole succession of Kant's followers tried to \u2018go\nbeyond\u2019 Kant by showing that there was finally no need to make\nthe separation between our knowledge and the thing-in-itself beyond\nour knowledge. One key step in departing from the surviving influence\nin Kant of Lutheran pietism was taken by Johann Gottlieb Fichte\n(1762\u20131814), who identified (as Kant did not) the will of the\nindividual with the infinite Ego which is ordering the universe\nmorally. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831) accomplished\na somewhat similar end by proposing that we should make the truth of\nideas relative to their original historical context against the\nbackground of a history that is progressing towards a final stage of\n\u2018absolute knowledge\u2019, in which Spirit (in\nGerman Geist, which means also \u2018mind\u2019)\nunderstands that reality is its own creation and there is no\n\u2018beyond\u2019 for it to know. Hegel is giving a philosophical\naccount of the Biblical notion of all things returning to God,\n\u2018so that God may be all in all.\u2019 (I Cor. 15:28)\nIn this world-history, Hegel located the Reformation as \u2018the\nall-enlightening sun\u2019 of the bright day that is our modern time\n(The Philosophy of History, 412). He thought that Geist moves\nimmanently through human history, and that the various stages of\nknowledge are also stages of freedom, each stage producing first its\nown internal contradiction, and then a radical transition into a new\nstage. The stage of absolute freedom will be one in which all members\nfreely by reason endorse the organic community and the concrete\ninstitutions in which they actually live (Phenomenology, BB,\nVI, B, III).\n\n\nOne of Hegel's opponents was Arthur Schopenhauer (1799\u20131860),\nthe philosopher of pessimism. Schopenhauer thought that Hegel had\nstrayed from the Kantian truth that there is a thing-in-itself beyond\nappearance, and that the Will is such a thing. He differed from Kant,\nhowever, in seeing the Will as the source of all our endless\nsuffering, a blind striving power without ultimate purpose or design\n(The World as Will and Representation, \u00a756 p. 310 and\n\u00a757 p. 311). It is, moreover, one universal Will that underlies\nthe wills of all separate individuals. The intellect and its ideas are\nsimply the Will's servant. On this view, there is no happiness for us,\nand our only consolation is a (quasi-Buddhist) release from the Will\nto the limited extent we can attain it, especially through aesthetic\nenjoyment.\n\n\nHegel's followers split into what are sometimes called \u2018Right\nHegelians\u2019 and \u2018Left Hegelians\u2019 (or \u2018Young\nHegelians\u2019). Right Hegelians promoted the generally positive\nview of the Prussian state that Hegel expressed in the Philosophy\nof Right. Left Hegelians rejected it, and with it the Protestant\nChristianity which they saw as its vehicle. In this way Hegel's\npeculiar way of promoting Christianity ended up causing its vehement\nrejection by thinkers who shared many of his social ideals. David\nFriedrich Strauss (1808\u201374) wrote The Life of Jesus\nCritically Examined, launching the historical-critical method of\nBiblical scholarship with the suggestion that much of the Biblical\naccount is myth or \u2018unconscious invention\u2019 that needs to\nbe separated out from the historical account. Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach\n(1804\u201372) wrote The Essence of Christianity in which he\npictured all religion as the means by which \u2018man projects his\nbeing into objectivity, and then again makes himself an object to this\nprojected image of himself\u2019 (The Essence of\nChristianity, 30). Feuerbach thought religion resulted from\nhumanity's alienation from itself, and philosophy needed to destroy\nthe religious illusion so that we could learn to love humankind and\nnot divert this love onto an imaginary object. Karl Marx\n(1818\u201383) followed Feuerbach in this diagnosis of religion, but\nhe was interested primarily in social and political relations rather\nthan psychology. He became suspicious of theory (for example Hegel's),\non the grounds that theory is itself a symptom of the power structures\nin the societies that produce it. \u201cTheory,\u201d Marx writes,\n\u201cis realized in a people only in so far as it is a realization\nof the people's needs\u201d (\u201cCritique of Hegel's Philosophy of\nRight,\u201d Early Writings, 252). And\n\u2018ideologies\u2019 and \u2018religion,\u2019 he believes,\narise from \u201cconditions that require [these] illusions\u201d\n(Ibid., 244). Marx returned to Hegel's thoughts about work revealing\nto the worker his value through what the worker produces, but Marx\nargues that under capitalism the worker was alienated from this\nproduct because other people owned both the product and the means of\nproducing it. Marx urged that the only way to prevent this was to\ndestroy the institution of private property (\u201cEconomic and\nPhilosophic Manuscripts,\u201d Early Writings, 348). Thus he\nbelieved, like Hegel, in progress through history towards freedom, but\nhe thought it would take Communist revolution to bring this about.\n\n\nA very different response to Hegel (and Kant) is found in the work of\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813\u201355), a religious thinker who\nstarted, like Hegel and Kant, from Lutheranism. Kierkegaard mocked\nHegel constantly for presuming to understand the whole system in which\nhuman history is embedded, while still being located in a particular\nsmall part of it. On the other hand, he used Hegelian categories of\nthought himself, especially in his idea of the aesthetic life, the\nethical life and the religious life as stages through which human\nbeings develop by means of first internal contradiction and then\nradical transition. Kierkegaard's relation with Kant was problematic\nas well. In Either/Or he caricatured Kant's ethical thought\n(as well as Hegel's) in the person of Judge William, who is stuck\nwithin the ethical life and has not been able to reach the life of\nfaith. On the other hand, his own description of the religious life is\nfull of echoes of Kant's Religion within the Boundaries of Mere\nReason. Kierkegaard wrote most of his work pseudonymously, taking\non the names of characters who lived the lives he describes. In the\naesthetic life the goal is to keep at bay the boredom that is\nconstantly threatening, and this requires enough distance from one's\nprojects that one is not stuck with them but can flit from engagement\nto engagement without pain (Either/Or, II. 77). This life\ndeconstructs, because it requires (in order to sustain interest) the\nvery commitment that it also rejects. The transition is accomplished\nby making a choice for one's life as a whole from a position that is\nnot attached to any particular project, a radical choice that requires\nadmitting the aesthetic life has been a failure. In this choice one\ndiscovers freedom, and thus the ethical life (Either/Or,\nII. 188). But this life too deconstructs, because it sets up the goal\nof living by a demand, the moral law, that is higher than we can live\nby our own human devices. Kierkegaard thought we have to realize that\nGod is (contrary to Fichte) \u2018another\u2019 (Sickness unto\nDeath xi 128), with whom we have to relate, and whose assistance\nis necessary even for the kind of repentance that is the transition\ninto the religious life. He also suggested that within the religious\nlife, there is a \u2018repetition\u2019 of the aesthetic life and\nthe ethical life, though in a transformed version.\n\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) was the son of a Lutheran pastor\nin Prussia. He was trained as a classical philologist, and his first\nbook, The Birth of Tragedy, was an account of the origin and\ndeath of ancient Greek tragedy. Nietzsche was deeply influenced by\nSchopenhauer, especially his view of the will (which Nietzsche called\n\u2018the Will to Power\u2019), and was first attracted and then\nrepelled by Wagner, who was also one of Schopenhauer's disciples. The\nbreaking point seems to have been\nWagner's Parsifal. Nietzsche by this time was opposed to\northodox Christianity and was promoting Ancient Greece instead, and he\nthought that Wagner was betraying his integrity by using an\n\u2018anti-Greek\u2019 Christian story for the opera. Nietzsche saw\nclearly the intimate link between Christianity and the ethical\ntheories of his predecessors in Europe, especially Kant. In On the\nGenealogy of Morals, he says, \u2018The advent of the Christian\nGod, as the maximum god attained so far, was therefore accompanied by\nthe maximum feeling of guilty indebtedness on earth. Presuming we have\ngradually entered upon the reverse course, there is no small\nprobability that with the irresistible decline of faith in the\nChristian God, there is now also a considerable decline in mankind's\nfeeling of guilt\u2019 (On the Genealogy of Morals,\n90\u20131). This is the \u2018death of God\u2019 which Nietzsche\nannounced, and which he predicted would also be the end of Kantian\nethics (The Gay Science, \u00a7108, 125, 343). It is harder\nto know what Nietzsche was for, than what he was against. This is\npartly an inheritance from Schopenhauer, who thought any system of\nconstructive ethical thought a delusion. But Nietzsche clearly admired\nthe Ancient Greeks, and thought we would be better off with a\n\u2018master\u2019 morality like theirs, rather than a\n\u2018slave\u2019 morality like Christianity. \u2018Mastery over\nhimself also necessarily gives him mastery over circumstances, over\nnature, and over all more short-willed and unreliable creatures\u2019\n(Genealogy, 59-60). By this last clause, he meant mastery\nover other people, and the model of this mastery is the\n\u2018overman\u2019 who is free of the resentment by the weak of the\nstrong that Nietzsche thought lay at the basis of Christian\nethics.\n\n\nTo return to Britain, Hume had a number of successors who accepted the\nview (which Hume took from Hutcheson) that our fundamental obligation\nis to work for the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Four are\nespecially significant. William Paley (1743\u20131805) thought he\ncould demonstrate that morality derived from the will of God and\nrequired promoting the happiness of all, that happiness was the sum of\npleasures, and that we need to believe that God is the final granter\nof happiness if we are to sustain motivation to do what we know we\nought to do (The Principles of Moral and Political\nPhilosophy, II. 4). Jeremy Bentham (1748\u20131832) rejected\nthis theological context. His grounds were radically empiricist, that\nthe only \u2018real\u2019 entities are publicly observable, and so\ndo not include God (or, for that matter, right or time or relations or\nqualities). He thought he could provide a scientific calculus of\npleasures, where the unit that stays constant is the minimum state of\nsensibility that can be distinguished from indifference. He thought we\ncould then separate different \u2018dimensions\u2019 in which these\nunits vary, such as intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity (how\nsoon the pleasures will come), fecundity (how many other pleasures\nthis pleasure will produce) and purity. Discarding the theological\ncontext made moral motivation problematic, for why should we expect\n(without God) more units of pleasure for ourselves by contributing to\nthe greater pleasure of others? Bentham's solution was to hope that\nlaw and social custom could provide individuals with adequate motives\nthrough the threat of social sanctions, and that what he called\n\u2018deontology\u2019 (which is personal or private morality) could\nmobilize hidden or long-range interests that were already present but\nobscure.\n\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806\u201373) was raised on strict utilitarian\nprinciples by his father, a follower of Bentham. Unlike Bentham,\nhowever, Mill accepted that there are qualitative differences in\npleasures simply as pleasures, and he thought that the higher\npleasures were those of the intellect, the feelings and imagination,\nand the moral sentiments. He observed that those who have experienced\nboth these and the lower pleasures, tend to prefer the former. At the\nage of twenty he had a collapse and a prolonged period of\n\u2018melancholy\u2019. He realized that his education had neglected\nthe culture or cultivation of\nfeelings, of which hope is a primary instance\n(Autobiography, 1. 84). In his Three Essays on\nReligion (published posthumously in 1874) he returned to the idea\nof hope, saying that \u2018the indulgence of hope with regard to the\ngovernment of the universe and the destiny of man after death, while\nwe recognize as a clear truth that we have no ground for more than a\nhope, is legitimate and philosophically defensible\u2019; without\nsuch hope, we are kept down by \u2018the disastrous feeling of\n\u201cnot worth while\u201d\u2019 (Three Essays\n249\u201350). Mill did not believe, however, that God was omnipotent,\ngiven all the evil in the world, and he insisted, like Kant, that we\nhave to be God's co-workers, not merely passive recipients of God's\nassistance.\n\n\nHenry Sidgwick (1838\u20131900) in Methods of Ethics\ndistinguished three methods: Intuitionism (which is, roughly, the\ncommon sense morality that some things, like deliberate ingratitude to\na benefactor, are self-evidently wrong in themselves independently of\ntheir consequences), Egoistic Hedonism (the view that self-evidently\nan individual ought to aim at a maximum balance of happiness for\nherself, where this is understood as the greatest balance of pleasure\nover pain), and Utilitarianism or Universalistic Hedonism, (the view\nthat self-evidently she ought to aim at the maximum balance of\nhappiness for all sentient beings present and future, whatever the\ncost to herself). Of these three, he rejected the first, on the\ngrounds that no concrete ethical principles are self-evident, and that\nwhen they conflict (as they do) we have to take consequences into\naccount in order to decide how to act. But Sidgwick found the relation\nbetween the other two methods much more problematic. Each principle\nseparately seemed to him self-evident, but when taken together they\nseems to be mutually inconsistent. He considered two solutions,\npsychological and metaphysical. The psychological solution was to\nbring in the pleasures and pains of sympathy, so that if we do good to\nall we end up (because of these pleasures) making ourselves\nhappiest. Sidgwick rejected this on the basis that sympathy is\ninevitably limited in its range, and we feel it most towards those\nclosest to us, so that even if we include sympathetic pleasures and\npains under Egoism, it will tend to increase the divergence between\nEgoistic and Utilitarian conduct, rather than bring them closer\ntogether. The metaphysical solution was to bring in a god who desires\nthe greatest total good of all living things, and who will reward and\npunish in accordance with this desire. Sidgwick recognized this as a\nreturn to the utilitarianism of Paley (Compare Methods of\nEthics, II. 1, 2 and IV. 4, 5). He thought this solution was both\nnecessary and sufficient to remove the contradiction in ethics. But\nthis was only a reason to accept it, if in general it is reasonable to\naccept certain principles (such as the Uniformity of Nature) which are\nnot self-evident and which cannot be proved, but which bring order and\ncoherence into a central part of our thought. Sidgwick did not commit\nhimself to an answer to this, one way or the other.\n",
