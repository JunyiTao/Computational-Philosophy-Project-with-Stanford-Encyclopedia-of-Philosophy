    "main_text": "Original Contributions by Latin American Analytic Philosophers || Applied Ethics, Bioethics, and Philosophy of Law\n3.2 Applied Ethics, Bioethics, and Philosophy of Law\n\nLatin American analytic philosophers have made important contributions\nto ethics, political philosophy, and philosophy of law (for overviews,\nsee Rivera L\u00f3pez 2010; Navarro 2010; V\u00e1squez 2012; and\nthe entry\n Liberalism in Latin America).\n This section presents a few contributions that apply analytic tools\nto address moral and political issues that are tied to the\nsociopolitical circumstances of Latin American countries.\n\nAbortion is not legal in most Latin American countries. Indeed, many\nwomen have died or been imprisoned due to this fact. However, abortion\nwas legalized in Mexico City in 2007 and decriminalized by the\nNational Supreme Court of Justice in 2021. Some analytic philosophers\nhave played a role in this change. Vald\u00e9s (2002) critically\nexamines the arguments of the Catholic Church against abortion. In\nVald\u00e9s (2001), she calls the public\u2019s attention to the\nproblems that arise from child and adolescent pregnancy and pregnancy\nthat results from rape. She also offers a critical assessment of the\nmain arguments for and against the legalization of abortion. She\ndistinguishes three concepts of a person (a biological concept, a\nconcept related to a potential person, and a moral concept of a\nperson), and argues that the concept of a person implicit in pro-life\nviews\u2014namely, that a person is present at the very moment of\nconception\u2014is not the moral concept that matters to this\n debate.[109]\n\nFlorencia Luna\u2019s views on vulnerability have been influential in\nbioethics. For many years, codes of ethics and research ethics\ntheories adopted a subpopulation approach. They used vulnerability\nas a label to refer to subjects of\nsome groups: women, racial minorities, the poor, the very sick, and so\non. This approach was subject to severe criticism, though. Some\nobjected that it promotes the creation of stereotypes that cannot be\neasily removed, and that reliance on labels does not offer sufficient\nprotection to vulnerable subjects. After all, it only exhorts\nresearchers and ethics committees to pay special attention to members\nof those groups when recruiting them as subjects in their studies.\nLuna (2004, 2009, 2019a) develops an account of vulnerability\nthat avoids these problems. On her\nview, vulnerability is a \u201clayered\nconcept\u201d: one and the same subject can have one or several\nlayers of vulnerability, those layers are not only determined by the\nsubject\u2019s membership in a group but also by their own context,\nand those layers can be modified and\u2014in some\ncases\u2014removed. Hence, being a woman does not entail per\nse being vulnerable. However, being a woman living in a country\nthat is intolerant to reproductive rights confers on that woman one\nlayer of vulnerability. If, on top of that, that woman is poor, she\nhas an extra layer of vulnerability. And so on. Since the layered\nconcept does not work as a label that singles out an essential\nproperty of members of some groups, it does not promote the creation\nof stereotypes. Given that the layered account does not treat vulnerability\nas a general and fixed category, it\nenables researchers to develop fine-grained analyses of specific\nlayers of vulnerability and\u2014on a case-by-case basis\u2014take\neffective action to mitigate them. For example, in a given country,\nwomen may have trouble negotiating the use of condoms with their\npartners. In such cases, the use of the female condom is not an\noption. Other contraceptive methods that preserve the secrecy that\nwomen may desire would be preferable. However, the use of those\ncontraceptive methods might not mitigate another layer of\nvulnerability, namely, the risk of HIV-AIDS\n infection.[110]\n\nCarlos Nino is the main representative of the Argentinian school of\nphilosophy of law. His influential work on human rights was a response\nto the human rights violations perpetrated by the \u201cmilitary\njuntas\u201d that governed the country from 1976 to 1983: thousands\nof people were tortured, assassinated, and subject to enforced\ndisappearance. As an advisor of Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn\u2014the\nArgentinian president from 1983 to 1989\u2014, Nino helped designing\nnew laws to promote human rights and prevent their violation and\ndevelop a strategy to punish the militaries responsible for human\nrights violations during the dictatorship (Malem Se\u00f1a 1994).\nNino\u2019s philosophical work provided a theoretical framework to\njustify these\n programs.[111]\n Moreover, Nino himself played a decisive role in their\n implementation.[112]\n Nino defended a form of moral constructivism according to which\nmorality is a social practice that seeks to overcome conflicts and\nfavor cooperation through consensus. He thought of moral practice as a\ndiscourse where individuals freely accept principles to guide their\nactions and attitudes towards the actions of others. Those principles\nenjoy an intrinsic validity that could be used to confer final\njustification on human rights independently of any legal order. He\nproposed a principle of the inviolability of the person,\nwhich prohibits the imposition on humans\u2014against their\nwill\u2014of sacrifices and privations that do not lead to their own\nbenefit, a principle of autonomy of the person, which\nemphasizes a person\u2019s capacity to choose freely a model of life\nand imposes a limit on any interventions by the State and others, and\na principle of the dignity of the person, which says that\nhumans should be treated in accordance with their own decisions,\nintentions, or manifestations of consent. These three principles,\ndevised in the 1970s and developed in Nino (1984), offered the\ntheoretical foundation for Alfons\u00edn\u2019s legal reforms to\npromote human rights and prevent their\n violation.[113]\n As for past violations of human rights by the State, Alfons\u00edn\nand his collaborators created a committee to inquire into those crimes\n(Comisi\u00f3n Nacional sobre la Desaparici\u00f3n de\nPersonas, CONADEP) and urged the competent bodies to prosecute\nand condemn some of the militaries responsible for those crimes (the\n\u201cJuicio a las\n Juntas\u201d).[114]\n They faced a problem, though: there were so many people involved in\nthose human rights violations that trying to prosecute them all\ninvolved a serious risk of destabilizing the fragile democratic\ninstitutions and provoking a military coup. Nino\u2019s\n(1985, 1991b) views on punishment proved useful. Given a retributivist\nconception of punishment, the right thing to do was to punish them\nall. However, Nino opposed that view on the ground that the sum of two\nills (the offender\u2019s act and the punishment) could not give rise\nto a good. His alternative view was instrumentalist. If punishment was\na means to prevent future human rights violations, one could attain\nthat goal by punishing a select number of responsible\n agents.[115]\n\nThe presence of indigenous peoples in Latin America has given rise to\npolitical, social, and cultural tensions. In the 1990s, the Mexican\nphilosopher Luis Villoro joined the Zapatist movement against the\nexploitation, discrimination, and oppression that indigenous peoples\nhad suffered for more than 500\n years.[116]\n In a 1997 book, he defended a novel conception of the State inspired\nby the idea of community, a form of organization that is key to\nindigenous peoples. In this form of social organization, power is\nconstrained by value and the individual is conceived as part of a\ncollectivity, without any relation of domination or subordination of\none entity to\n another.[117]\n In a subsequent 2007 book, Villoro defended a moderate\nmulticulturalism that sought to reconcile the universality of human\nrights with the respect and tolerance of cultural diversity. He also\ndefended a communitarian democracy and urged national states to\nrespect the self-determination of indigenous peoples.\n\nMore recently, some Latin American analytic philosophers have\ncontributed to the global discussion about the distribution of\nvaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, have helped develop protocols\nfor the allocation of scarce therapeutic resources (triage),\nand have discussed the social organization of science during the\n pandemic.[118]\n",
