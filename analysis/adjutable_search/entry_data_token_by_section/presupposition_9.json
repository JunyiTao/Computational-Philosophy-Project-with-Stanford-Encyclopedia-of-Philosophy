    "main_text": "Accommodation\n5. Accommodation\n\nThe most important feature of the satisfaction model not covered in\nthe description above is accommodation. Accommodation was first\ndiscussed by Karttunen (1974) and Stalnaker (1974), though only named\nas such by Lewis (1979). Karttunen introduces the concept as\nfollows:\n\nOrdinary conversation does not always proceed in the ideal orderly\nfashion described earlier. People do make leaps and shortcuts by using\nsentences whose presuppositions are not satisfied in the\nconversational context. This is the rule rather than the exception\n[\u2026] I think we can maintain that a sentence is always taken to\nbe an increment to a context that satisfies its presuppositions. If\nthe current conversational context does not suffice, the listener is\nentitled and expected to extend it as required. (Karttunen 1974: 191)\n\n\nIf this looks reasonably straightforward, the reader should be warned\nthat accommodation is among the more contentious topics in\npresupposition theory.\n [20]\n\nTo begin with, there are various notions of accommodation, some of\nwhich are stricter than others. To explain, consider the following\nexample by Heim (1982):\n\n(33)\nJohn read a book about Schubert and wrote to the author.\n\n\nIn order to determine the intended meaning of \u201cthe\nauthor\u201d, the hearer has to infer (i) that there is an\nauthor and (ii) that the said author wrote the book read by\nJohn. Whereas on a broad understanding of accommodation, all of this\nis accommodated, on a strict construal only (i) is, and\n(ii) is a bridging inference. This is not just a matter of\nterminology. If we choose to be strict, we can argue that there is\nsomething like an \u201caccommodation module\u201d, which as such\nhas nothing to do with world knowledge; whereas if the notion is\nconstrued more broadly, accommodation is of a piece with bridging. To\nfacilitate the following discussion, we will adopt a strict notion of\naccommodation, and take the naive view that what is accommodated is\nthe presupposition as triggered by, e.g., a definite NP or factive\nverb.\n",
