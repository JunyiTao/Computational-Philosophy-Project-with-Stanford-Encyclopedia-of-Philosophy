Logical matrices\n\nIn the last section, we saw that to provide a logic with an algebraic\nsemantics we need in many cases to consider in every algebra a set of\ndesignated elements instead of a single designated one. In the\nexamples we discussed, the set of designated elements was definable in\nthe algebras by one equation. This motivated the definition of\nalgebraic semantics in\n Section 5.\n For many logics, to obtain a semantics similar to an algebraic\nsemantics using the class of algebras naturally associated with them\none needs for every algebra a set of designated elements that cannot\nbe defined using only the equations of the algebraic language or is\nnot even definable by using this language only. As we already\nmentioned, one example where this happens is the local consequence of\nthe normal modal logic \\(K\\). Also, recall that there are logics with no algebraic semantics at all.\n\nTo endow every logic with a semantics of an algebraic kind\none has to consider, at least, algebras together with a set of\ndesignated elements, without any requirement about its definability\nusing the corresponding algebraic language. These pairs are the\nlogical matrices. Tarski defined the general concept of logical matrix\nin the 1920s but the concept was already implicit in previous work by\n\u0141ukasiewicz, Bernays, Post and others, who used truth-tables,\neither in independence proofs or to define logics different from\nclassical logic. A logical matrix is a pair \\(\\langle \\bA, D\n\\rangle\\) where \\(\\bA\\) is an algebra and \\(D\\) a\nsubset of the universe \\(A\\) of \\(\\bA\\); the elements\nof \\(D\\) are called the designated elements of\nthe matrix and accordingly \\(D\\) is called the set\nof designated elements (and some authors call it the truth\nset of the matrix). Logical matrices were first used as models of\nthe theorems of specific logic systems, for instance in the work of\nMcKinsey and Tarski, and also to define sets of formulas with similar\nproperties to those of the set of theorems of a logic system, namely\nclosure under substitution instances. This was the case of the \\(n\\)-valued\nlogics of \u0141ukasiewicz and of his\ninfinite-valued logic. And it was Tarski who first considered logical\nmatrices as a general tool to define this kind of sets.\n\nThe general theory of logical matrices explained in this entry is due\nmainly to Polish logicians, starting with \u0141o\u015b 1949 and\ncontinuing in \u0141o\u015b & Suszko 1958, building on previous\nwork by Lindenbaum. In \u0141o\u015b and Suszko\u2019s paper matrices\nare used for the first time both as models of logic systems (in our\nsense) and to define systems of these kind.\n\nIn the rest of the section, we present the relevant concepts of the\ntheory of logical matrices using modern terminology.\n\nGiven a logic \\(\\bL\\), a logical matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is\nsaid to be a model of \\(\\bL\\) if wherever \\(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\), then every valuation \\(v\\) on\n\\(\\bA\\) that maps the elements of \\(\\Gamma\\) to some designated value\n(i.e., an element of \\(D)\\) also maps \\(\\phi\\) to a designated value.\nWhen \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) it is said that\n\\(D\\) is an \\(\\bL\\)-filter of the algebra\n\\(\\bA\\). The set of \\(\\bL\\)-filters of an algebra \\(\\bA\\) plays a\ncrucial role in the theory of the algebraization of logic systems. We\nwill come to this point later.\n\nA class \\(\\bM\\) of logical matrices is said to be a matrix\nsemantics for a logic \\(\\bL\\) if\n\n(*)\n\\( \\Gamma \\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tD\n\\rangle \\in \\bM\\) and every valuation \\(v\\) on \\(\\bA\\), if\n\\(\\bv[\\Gamma] \\subseteq D\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in D\\). \n\n\nThe implication from left to right says that \\(\\bL\\) is sound relative\nto \\(\\bM\\), and the other implication says that it is complete. In\nother words, \\(\\bM\\) is a matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\) if and only if\nevery matrix in \\(\\bM\\) is a model of \\(\\bL\\) and moreover for every\n\\(\\Gamma\\) and \\(\\phi\\) such that \\(\\Gamma \\not\\vdash_{\\bL } \\phi\\)\nthere is a model \\(\\langle \\bA, \\tD \\rangle\\) of \\(\\bL\\) in \\(\\bM\\)\nthat witnesses the fact, namely there is a valuation on the model that\nsends the formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\) to designated elements and \\(\\phi\\)\nto a non-designated one.\n\nLogical matrices are also used to define logics semantically. If \\(\\cM\n= \\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is a logical matrix, the relation defined\nby\n\n\n\\(\\Gamma \\vdash_{\\cM } \\phi\\txtiff\\) for every valuation \\(v\\)\non \\(\\bA\\) if \\(\\bv(\\psi) \\in D\\) for all \\(\\psi \\in\n\\Gamma\\), then \\(\\bv(\\phi) \\in D\\)\n\n\nis a consequence relation which is substitution-invariant; therefore\n\\(\\langle L, \\vdash_{\\cM } \\rangle\\) is a logic system. Similarly, we\ncan define the logic of a class of matrices \\(\\bM\\) by taking\ncondition (*) as a definition of a consequence relation. In the entry\non\n many-valued logic\n the reader can find several logics defined in this way.\nEvery logic (independently of how it is defined) has a matrix semantics. Moreover, every logic has a matrix semantics whose elements have the property of being reduced in the following sense: A matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is reduced if there are no two different elements of \\(A\\) that behave in the same way. We say that \\(a, b \\in A\\) behave in the same way in \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) if for every formula \\(\\phi (q, p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\) and all elements \\(d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n \\in A\\) \\[\\phi^{\\bA }[a, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n] \\in D \\txtiff \\phi^{\\bA }[b, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n] \\in D.\\] Thus \\(a, b \\in A\\) behave differently if there is a formula \\(\\phi(q, p_1 , \\ldots ,p_n)\\) and elements \\(d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n \\in A\\) such that one of \\(\\phi^{\\bA }[a, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n]\\) and \\(\\phi^{\\bA }[b, d_1 , \\ldots ,d_n]\\) belongs to \\(D\\) but not both. The relation of behaving in the same way in \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) is a congruence relation of \\(\\bA\\). This relation is known after Blok & Pigozzi 1986, 1989 as the Leibniz congruence of the matrix \\(\\langle \\bA, D \\rangle\\) and is denoted by \\(\\bOmega_{\\bA }(D)\\). It can be characterized as the greatest congruence relation of \\(\\bA\\) that is compatible with \\(D\\), that is, that does not relate elements in \\(D\\) with elements not in \\(D\\). The concept of Leibniz congruence plays a fundamental role in the general theory of the algebraization of the logic systems developed during the 1980s by Blok and Pigozzi. The reader is referred to Font, Jansana, & Pigozzi 2003 and Czelakowski 2001 for extensive information on the developments around the concept of Leibniz congruence during this period.\n\nEvery matrix \\(\\cM\\) can be turned into a reduced matrix by\nidentifying the elements related by its Leibniz congruence. This\nmatrix is called the reduction of \\(\\cM\\) and is usually\ndenoted by \\(\\cM^*\\). A matrix and its reduction are models of the\nsame logic systems, and since reduced matrices have no redundant\nelements, the classes of reduced matrices that are matrix semantics\nfor logic systems are usually taken as the classes of matrices that\ndeserve study; they are better suited to encoding in algebraic-like\nterms the properties of the logics that have them as their matrix\nsemantics.\n\nThe proof that every logic system has a reduced matrix semantics\n(i.e., a matrix semantics consisting of reduced matrices) is as\nfollows. Let \\(\\bL\\) be a logic system. Consider the matrices\n\\(\\langle \\bFm_L, T \\rangle\\) over the formula algebra, where \\(T\\)\nis a theory of \\(\\bL\\). These matrices are known as\nthe Lindenbaum matrices of \\(\\bL\\). It is not difficult to\nsee that the class of those matrices is a matrix semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\). Since a matrix and its reduction are models of the same\nlogics, the reductions of the Lindenbaum matrices of \\(\\bL\\)\nconstitute a matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\) too, and indeed a reduced\none. Moreover, any class of reduced matrix models of \\(\\bL\\) that\nincludes the reduced Lindenbaum matrices of \\(\\bL\\) is automatically a\ncomplete matrix semantics for \\(\\bL\\). In particular, the class of all\nreduced matrix models of \\(\\bL\\) is a complete matrix semantics for\n\\(\\bL\\). We denote this class by \\(\\bRMatr(\\bL)\\).\n\nThe above proof can be seen as a generalization of the\nLindenbaum-Tarski method for proving algebraic completeness theorems\nthat we will discuss in the next section.\n\nThe class of the algebras of the matrices in \\(\\bRMatr(\\bL)\\) plays a\nprominent role in the theory of the algebraization of logics and it is\ndenoted by \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\). It has been considered for a long time the\nnatural class of algebras that has to be associated with a given logic\n\\(\\bL\\) as its algebraic counterpart. For instance, in the examples\nconsidered above the classes of algebras that were given as algebraic\nsemantics of the different logics (Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras,\netc.) are exactly the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) of the corresponding logic\n\\(\\bL\\). And in fact, the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) coincides with what was\ntaken to be the natural class of algebras for all the logics \\(\\bL\\)\nstudied up to the 1990s. In the 1990s, due to the knowledge acquired\nof several logics not studied before, some authors proposed another\nway to define the class of algebras that has to be counted as the\nalgebraic counterpart to be associated with a given logic \\(\\bL\\). For\nmany logics \\(\\bL\\), it leads exactly to the class \\(\\bAlg^*\\bL\\) but\nfor others it gives a class that extends it properly. We will discuss\nit in\n Section 8.\n",
