    "main_text": "History\n4. History\n\n\nIn the early years of NF studies (1937\u20131952) it was not known whether\nor not NF proved the axiom of infinity. Specker showed that it did,\nthough he never published his proof: the (quite different) proof in\nSpecker [1953] is of his stronger result that NF proves that the\nuniverse cannot be wellordered (and is therefore infinite) and the\nfirst published proof is in Henson [1973a])\n\n\nSo NF refutes AC. However \u2013 so far \u2013 it seems that (apart from\nsome weird weak formulations that make no sense outside an NF context\nand which all arise from refinements of Specker\u2019s proof) it is only\nfull AC that fails, so that some strong consequences of AC\nremain on the cards for the moment. In particular, no-one has refuted\nthe prime ideal theorem or countable choice or DC. Further, it is\nstriking that all known failures of AC involve big sets. An axiom\nsaying that all wellfounded sets are wellordered might \u2013 for all\nwe know \u2013 be consistent with NF. In particular there is no reason\nto suppose that NF refutes the weak forms of AC needed in the study of\nthe reals and complexes (\u201cAnalysis\u201d). Indeed as far as we\nknow we can safely add to NF some axioms to say that the wellfounded\nsets form a model of ZFC. According to this view, NF does not so much\ncontradict ZFC as cover extra topics, such as the universal set\n \u2013  phenomena about which ZF has nothing to say. This underpins\nthe view held by both Church and Quine, albeit in different ways, that\na synthesis of ZFC and NF could be obtained along these lines.\n\n\nQuite early on Quine added classes to NF to obtain a theory of\nsets-with-classes known as ML. In the ZF context, adding classes is a\nnatural thing to do, for it enables one to reduce the infinite\nreplacement scheme to a single set-existence axiom: \u201cthe image\nof a set in a class is a set\u201d if augmented with suitable\nclass-existence axioms. However, none of the axioms of NF refer to\nclasses in the way the replacement scheme of ZF does, so there is\nnothing for the class existence axioms to do. For this reason ML is\nnowadays regarded as a pointless syntactic complication of NF with no\nnew mathematics, and it is not the subject of any research. At best\nthe classes can be a harmless halo of epiphenomena (Wang\n[1950]). However, at worst \u2013 if the set existence axioms are\nallowed to have bound class variables (as in the 1940 first edition of\nQuine [1951a]) \u2013 then the class of total orders that are genuinely\n(\u201cexternally\u201d) wellordered (no subclasses without\nleast members) becomes a set and we have the Burali-Forti paradox\n(Rosser [1942]). The rumours still occasionally surfacing among\nmathematicians of the inconsistency of NF probably have their origin\nin a misreporting of this result, but the result itself concerns ML\nonly so it has no bearing on the consistency question for NF. If NF is\ninconsistent it is for totally different reasons. There is recent\nwork suggesting that NF is consistent but it has not yet been\nconfirmed. A paper containing an alleged proof of Con(NF) is working\nits way through the refereeing process as this entry is being revised\nin 2018.\n\n\nIn [1944] Hailperin gave the first of a number of finite\naxiomatisations of NF now known. Many of them exploit the function \\(x\n\\mapsto \\{y : x \\in y\\}\\) which is injective and total and is an\n\\(\\in\\)-isomorphism. This function was known to Whitehead, who\nsuggested to Quine that \\(\\{y : x \\in y\\}\\) should be called the\n\u201cessence\u201d of \\(x\\) (a terminology clearly suggested by a\nview of sets as properties-in-extension).\n\n\nAnother early result was the observation of Rosser [1952] that NF\nadmitted a type-level ordered pair iff the axiom of infinity was a\ntheorem of NF. (see Forster [1994])\n\n\nThe second major development was Scott\u2019s [1962] application of\nRieger-Bernays independence methods to NF. If \\(\\langle X, E\\rangle\\)\nis a binary structure with \\(E\\) an extensional relation on \\(X\\) (so\nthat \\(\\langle X, E\\rangle\\) is a model of a set theory of some kind)\nand \\(\\pi\\) is a permutation of \\(X\\), then \\(\\{\\langle x,\n\\pi(y)\\rangle : \\langle x, y\\rangle \\in E\\}\\) is also an extensional\nrelation on \\(X\\) and gives us a new model of some kind of set\ntheory. If certain constraints are respected, this method outputs\nmodels of ZF when given models of ZF (and was first invented in order\nto prove the independence of the axiom of foundation from the other\naxioms of ZF) but it works even better with NF, since the construction\npreserves stratified formul\u00e6.\n\n\nThe third major development came when Specker (in [1958] and [1962])\nplaced the narrative in Quine [1937a] recounted above on a firm\nmathematical footing. (For an illustrated translation, with\ncommentary, of Specker [1958], see Forster [2000], in the Other\nInternet Resources section below.) We\u2019ve seen that \\(\\Phi^+\\)\nis the result of raising all the type subscripts on all variables in\n\\(\\Phi\\) by one. Then \\(\\Phi \\leftrightarrow \\Phi^+\\) is an axiom of\ntypical ambiguity. Specker established that the consistency of NF\nis equivalent to the consistency of TST + the scheme of all axioms of\ntypical ambiguity. This reduction of the consistency question of NF to\nthe consistency of TST + the axiom scheme of typical ambiguity\nclarifies matters but doesn\u2019t actually solve anything, since the\naxioms of typical ambiguity turn out to be quite strong \u2013 as are\ntheir analogues in other languages (such as geometry) that admit\nendomorphisms. Notice that the mere fact that if \\(\\phi\\) is provable\nthen so is \\(\\phi^+\\) is not enough to ensure that \\(\\phi \\rightarrow \\phi^+\\) is provable, so the axioms of typical ambiguity are\nprima facie nontrivial and we should not be surprised that\nthey turn out to be strong.\n\n\nKaye [1991] generalised Specker\u2019s method to show how any typed\ntheory of sets, garnished with the axioms of typical ambiguity, turns\nout to be equiconsistent with a one-sorted theory. Various weak\nfragments of NF can be shown consistent by this kind of\nanalysis. Oswald ([1976], [1981] and [1982]) introduced a notation\naccording to which \\(NF_n\\) is the system axiomatised by the\n\\(n\\)-stratified axioms of NF, and \\(N_n F\\) is extensionality\nplus the existence of \\(\\{x : \\phi(x)\\}\\) where \\(\\phi\\) is\n\\(n\\)-stratified (parameters are allowed). Oswald showed that\n\n\\[\nN_1 F \\subseteq NF_2 \\subseteq N_2 F \\subseteq NF_3 \\subseteq N_3 F = \\mathrm{NF}\n\\]\n\n\nand that the inclusions are all proper. The consistency of \\(NF_3\\) is\na result of Grishin [1969].\n\n\nCrabb\u00e9 [1982a] proved the consistency of two predicative\nfragments of NF: NFP and NFI. Both are extensionality plus existence\nof \\(\\{y : \\phi(y, x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\}\\) where \\(\\phi\\) is stratified\nand there are extra restrictions on the variables in \\(\\phi\\). All\nvariables (bound or free) are restricted to type no higher than that\nof the set being defined; bound variable are not to be of any type\nexceeding the type of \\(y\\) (NFP) or (type of \\(y) + 1\\) (NFI). NFP +\nAxiom of sumset = NF. They are distinguished from the other subsystems\nof NF known to be consistent by the circumstance that they allow a\nproof of the axiom of infinity which makes essential use of\nSpecker\u2019s proof of the axiom of infinity. In NFP we argue:\neither the axiom of sumset holds, in which case we have NF and can run\nSpecker\u2019s proof of the Axiom of infinity, or (ii) it\ndoesn\u2019t, in which case \u2013 since finite sets have\nsumsets \u2013 not every set is finite.\n\n\nThe most dramatic result obtained by a\ntype-theory-plus-ambiguity-axiom analysis came when Ronald Jensen\n[1969] noticed that if we weaken TST to a theory called TSTU by\nallowing the existence of urelemente (distinct empty sets)\nthen it is easy to prove the consistency of the axioms of typical\nambiguity. The result is a model of NFU, which is NF with\nextensionality weakened to allow urelemente. Jensen referred\nto NFU as \u201cslight(?) modification of Quine\u2019s NF\u201d,\nbut \u2013 as he showed \u2013 the modification has huge effects:\nSpecker\u2019s proof of the axiom of infinity no longer works, and AC is\nnot refutable either.\n \n\nJensen\u2019s consistency proof for TSTU (and thereby NFU) combines Ramsey\ntheory with a technique that had been developed originally by Abraham\nRobinson [1939] to obtain a proof of the independence of\nextensionality from the other axioms of ZF.\n\n\nBoffa [1988] noticed another consistency proof of NFU. If\n\\(\\langle V, \\in \\rangle\\) is a model of \\(Z\\) (Zermelo set\ntheory) with an external automorphism \\(\\sigma\\) and an ordinal \\(\\kappa\\)\nsuch that \\(\\kappa \\rangle \\sigma(\\kappa)\\), then\n\\(V_{\\kappa}\\) is the domain of a model of NFU\nwhose membership relation is\n\n\\[\n\\{\\langle x, y\\rangle : \\sigma(x) \\in y \\amp \\varrho(y) \\le \\sigma(\\kappa) + 1\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\((\\varrho\\) is set-theoretic rank.) Remarkably, as Holmes showed, one can\neven recover from this model of NFU the nonstandard model of ZF that\ngave rise to it. He does this by exploiting the idea of set pictures.\nWe saw earlier the idea that set theory is the theory of one\nextensional binary relation (with equality of course: extensionality\ncannot be defined in a language without equality). Thus one could say\nthat a set (or, better, a set picture) is a isomorphism class\nof binary structures consisting of a domain, an extensional binary\nrelation, and a designated element of the carrier set. Relational\nstructures of this kind look like transitive closures of sets and the\ndesignated element of the domain indicates the set whose transitive\nclosure is being depicted. (Consequently there is an accessibility\ncondition for the designated element: if one thinks of the extensional\nrelation as a graph, there must be a directed path from any element to\nthe designated element).\n\n\nAlthough it was Aczel\u2019s [1988] book that made the idea of Accessible Pointed Graph common\ncurrency, the idea goes back at least to Hinnion\u2019s Ph.D. thesis [1974]\nand in a less developed form to Specker\u2019s (unpublished)\nHabilitationsschrift and quite possibly earlier. Aczel used\nthis technique to provide models of Forti-Honsell\u2019s antifoundation\naxiom [1983]; Hinnion\u2019s idea was to use isomorphism classes of\nwellfounded pointed extensional relational types to interpret\ntheories of wellfounded sets in NF. With wellfounded extensional\nrelations one does not need to make the pointing explicit, since the\nwellfoundedness ensures that at most one element of the carrier set\ncan satisfy the accessibility condition. (This is not so in general:\nthe two sets \\(x = \\{y\\}\\); \\(y = \\{x, \\varnothing \\}\\) have set pictures that have the same binary\nrelation but different pointing.) In NFU each set picture is a set (a\nbig set, as it happens) and Holmes showed that in a model arising\n\u00e0 la Boffa the set pictures reproduce the sets of the\noriginal nonstandard model. This striking phenomenon \u2013 which has\nno parallel in the study of NF \u2013 justifies Holmes\u2019 dictum that\n\u201cNFU can be understood as the theory of certain nonstandard\nmodels of Zermelo-style set theory with automorphisms.\u201d\n\n\nThere is a widespread misapprehension that Cantor\u2019s theorem shows\nthat there cannot be a consistent set theory with a universal set. That\nerror can be refuted by Jensen\u2019s construction of his models for NFU,\nbut by far the most appealing demonstration is a later construction of\na model of a set theory with a universal set by Church and Oswald\nindependently and roughly simultaneously in the early 1970s. It has the advantage over NFU\nof respecting extensionality: it is a genuine model of a theory of pure\nsets. The construction is a refinement of Rieger-Bernays methods. It\ngoes as follows: start with a model of something like ZF, and a\nbijection \\(k\\) between \\(V\\) and \\(V \\times \\{0, 1\\}\\). We\nnow define a new membership relation \\(E\\) so that \\(xEy\\)\niff either the second component of \\(k(y)\\) is 1 and\n\\(x \\in\\) first component, or the second component of\n\\(k(y)\\) is 0 and \\(x \\not\\in\\) first component.\n\\(k^{-1}(\\varnothing)\\) is now the universal set. In fact\n \\(k^{-1}(\\langle x,0\\rangle)\\) and\n \\(k^{-1}(\\langle x,1\\rangle)\\) are\nset-complements in this new structure.\n\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, given that constructions like this provide\ncomplements for all sets, they give a central r\u00f4le to the concept\nof wellfounded set in that the wellfounded sets of the new\nmodel can be made to be an isomorphic copy of the wellfounded sets in\nthe structure one starts with. Further, these models satisfy a scheme\nof replacement for wellfounded sets: anything the same size as a\nwellfounded set is a set.
