    "main_text": "Avicenna\n4. Averroes\n\n\n Averroes (Abu\u2019l-Wal\u00eed Muhammad b.\nAhmad ben Rushd, 1126\u201398) hews closer to the Peripatetic tradition than\nhis predecessors, and it is as The Commentator on Aristotle that he was\nknown in Europe. He commented on De anima three times, and\nwrote an epitome of the Parva Naturalia. His Short Commentary\non De anima is also, and more correctly, an epitome, being a\nsummary of Aristotle's work rather than a precise and more\nliteral commentary, as are his Middle and Long, or\nGrand,\n commentaries.[44]\nIn the Short Commentary, Averroes sets the stage for Aristotle's\ndescription of the soul by offering a capsule summary of his main\nteachings in physics, meteorology, and physiology. These mainly concern\nthe hylomorphic composition of all bodies; the nature of the four\nelements; and the generative role in an organism caused by the heavenly\nbodies and by the innate heat, or pneuma, of a\n body.[45]\nThe soul,\nAverroes thus indicates, is the product of natural causes, both\nproximate and remote, terrestial and celestial. Among the latter is the\nAgent Intellect, whose relation to bodies, like that of the other\nheavenly intelligences, is \u201cincidental\u201d (or\n\u201caccidental,\u201d bi\u2019l-\u2018ara\u1e0d), since it is\nessentially \u201cseparate\u201d from them, being immaterial.\n\n\n Averroes stresses the hierarchical\nstructure of the soul, beginning with the nutritive faculty. It serves\nas a substrate for the sensory faculties, their matter\n\u201cdisposed\u201d to receive sensory perceptions. This disposition\nis the first perfection or actuality of the sensory faculty, rendering\nthat faculty's potentiality an actual, if still unrealized, state\nof being. The higher faculty is thus present, albeit potentially, in\nthe lower.\n\n\n Each faculty is similarly sustained by one\nmore material, or less \u201cspiritual,\u201d than it: the senses\nserve as substrate for the common sense, it the substrate for the\nimagination, and that faculty the substrate for the rational\n faculty.[46]\nAs such, the\nimagination follows the senses in providing the intellect with images\nthat have intelligible dimensions, or \u201cintentions\u201d\n(ma\u2018\u00e2n\u00ee), which term Averroes uses more broadly than\nheretofore. These intentions are present in the form presented to the\nsenses, but must wait upon an intellect to appreciate them, being\nrepresented first as sensible and then imaginative intentions to the\nsenses and imagination, respectively. Averroes thus employs\n\u201cintentions\u201d to convey not the form of the perceptible\nobject as it is, but as it is sensed, imagined, remembered or\nintellected by the respective faculties of the soul.\n\n\n Averroes' contribution to the\nphilosophy of mind lies primarily in his attempt to refine and redefine\nthe activities of the internal senses, and to determine the nature of\nthe hylic, or material, intellect. He discusses the role of the\ninternal senses primarily in his De anima commentaries as well\nas in his epitomes on the senses and memory. His work builds on\nAristotle and the psychological writings of his Andalusian predecessor\nIbn B\u00e2jjah (d. 1138), known to the West as\n Avempace.[47]\nAverroes'\nwork also incorporates a response and rebuke to Avicenna, rejecting,\namong other things, his elevation of wahm, estimation, to the\nstatus of an additional internal sense. For Averroes, imagination and\nmemory can do the work of Avicenna's estimative faculty.\n\n\n Aristotle had begun his\ntreatise On Memory by distinguishing between the acts of remembering\nand recollecting. He saw both as related to, though distinct from, the\ninternal senses (common sense and imagination) and the\nrational\n faculty.[48]\n\n\n In Aristotle's view, the\nimagination internalizes and copies an object originally presented to\nthe senses and assembled into a single sensation by the common sense;\nand the memorative faculty receives \u201csome such thing as a\npicture\u201d (z\u00f4graph\u00eama ti), \u201ca sort of\nimpression\u201d (tupon tina) of that percept (transmitted\nthrough the\n imagination).[49]\nRecollection is a deliberative act that joins\nthe impression retained in memory with the percept as originally\nimagined.\n\n\n Elaborating on Aristotle's text,\nAverroes regards memory as created by a process of continuous\nabstraction, or \u201cspiritualization.\u201d The form of an\nexternal object is sensed at first with its many \u201crinds\u201d or\nhusks of corporeality (qush\u00fbr), for which read\nparticularity. The common sense and then the imaginative\n faculty[50]\nreceive\n(intentional adaptations of) this form in an increasingly immaterial\nmanner, followed by a \u201cdiscriminating faculty,\u201d i.e., the\ncogitative faculty, treated as another internal\n sense.[51]\nThis faculty actually serves\nas a bridge between imagination and intellect, dealing with particular\nimages as it does, but selecting out the most distinctive aspect of\neach percept. It brings the purification process to a close, memory\n(dhikr) receiving an essentialized notion or intention of a\nparticular\n percept.[52]\n\n\n Memory stores these dismembered\nessentialized images and is able to remember them at will, that is,\nwith an act of will. Recollection (tadhakkur) rejoins them in\nthe cogitative faculty with full images that flesh out the corporeal\nfeatures of the sought object. As described, there is a parallel\nbetween the activity of memory and that of the intellect in\nhabitu as developed by Alexander of Aphrodisias, for both retain\nthe essential notions that form respectively the previously apprehended\ncontents of a given particular percept (the role of memory) or of a\nuniversal concept (the intellect in habitu).\n\n\n While generally restricting the memorative\nfaculty to the intentions of a given imagined form, Averroes\nacknowledges that it also relates to universals. This is done through\nthe cogitative faculty, associating the universal with some particular\nimage, recollected with the assistance of the intention stored in the\nmemorative faculty; an \u201cintention\u201d that is the distinctive\ncharacter or nature of that\n image.[53]\nThat is to say, one remembers a universal\nidea by remembering an image that connotes it. As Aristotle says,\n\u201cwithout an image, thinking is\n impossible.\u201d[54]\n\n\n Averroes thus understands\nrecollection as a three-fold operation: the cogitative faculty employs\nthe intentions of an imagined form retained in memory, and combines\nthem with the original sensory image to elicit a full recollection of\nthe percept\n desired.[55]\nThe similarity of this scheme to that\ndeveloped by Avicenna is striking, though Averroes' scheme is\nmore parsimonious.\n\n\n Averroes recognizes with Avicenna\nthat animals have an acute intentional sense, and are able to identify\nnon-sensible qualities in the nature of others immediately, thereby\nenhancing their survival. Averroes considers this a function of the\nimagination, abetted by memory, and doesn\u2019t grant it the status\nof an independent \u201cestimative\u201d faculty (wahm), not\nwanting to multiply the soul's faculties more than Aristotle\nhad\n done.[56]\n\n\n Averroes follows Galen and \u201cthe\nconsensus of opinion\u201d rather than Aristotle in locating the\ninternal senses and memory in various parts of the brain: the common\nsense and imaginative faculty in the forward lobe, the cogitative\nfaculty in the middle, and memory in the\n rear.[57]\nGood memory is said to depend\non dryness in the front and back of the brain, poor memory due to\nmoisture that prevents images and ideas from retaining their hold. The\nbest disposition, manifest mostly in youth, is of a middle kind,\nenabling both quickness of understanding (the positive benefit of\nmoisture) and a long\n memory.[58]\n\n\n While the internal senses, as of course the\nexternal senses, have physical locations in the organs of the body, the\nrational faculty has not. That does not prevent Averroes from\nconceiving it as being structured in the hylomorphic pattern that is\ncharacteristic of Aristotle's physics. As expressed in the\nEpitome to De anima, it is the cogitative faculty, there\ncalled simply the practical intellect, which first processes sensory\nand imaginative intentions, exercising choice and deliberation along\nrational lines both inductive and deductive. This practical intellect\nthen serves as matter or substrate for its theoretical counterpart,\nwhich abstracts the universal idea or proposition from the particular\nsubject formerly\n addressed.[59]\n\n\n The theoretical intellect's striving\nfor universal truth is the acme of the soul's perfection, which\nAverroes calls a \u201cvery divine\u201d\n pursuit,[60]\nthough he believes relatively\nfew individuals succeed at it. The ultimate knowledge sought is of the\nAgent Intellect itself. Mankind as a whole has not reached this level,\nbut it will one day, since \u201cnature refuses\u201d to allow all\ntrue (and finite) possibilities not to be eventually realized (given an\neternal\n universe).[61]\n\n\n While this statement is not repeated in his\nother two commentaries on De anima, Averroes' belief in the attainment\nof personal perfection through knowledge of the Agent Intellect\nremained constant. Every cognition of an intelligible is an act of\nidentification of subject and object, no material barrier existing\nbetween\n them.[62]\nKnowledge of the Agent Intellect,\nhowever, is thought to surpass everything else, its content uniquely\nand totally comprehensive. The species of all forms on earth are found\nunified in it in a way that renders it a single intelligible being.\n\n\n Averroes held to the view of the Agent\nIntellect as a form of (earthly) forms throughout his life, though his\nunderstanding of the relationship between it and the forms on earth\nunderwent change. While first thinking the Agent Intellect an emanative\nsubstance that bestowed forms on all sub-lunar substances, he later\nregarded it in Aristotelian terms simply as an efficient cause of\nintellection, \u201cilluminating\u201d or actualizing both the\npotentially intelligent subject and intelligible\n object.[63]\nHowever, as the\nultimate object of humanity's quest for knowledge, the Agent\nIntellect served as a final cause of intellection, conjunction with it\noffering a person the greatest felicity (sa\u2018\u00e2dah) one's\nsoul could have.\n\n\n For Averroes, as for his predecessors, the\nintellectual potentiality of a person, represented by the hylic or\nmaterial intellect, is brought into actuality by the Agent Intellect.\nThis creates a latent store of ideas, the intellect in habitu\n(al-\u2018aql bi\u2019l malakah), which become operationally the\nacquired intellect (al-\u2018aql al-mustaf\u00e2d). It is in this\nlast stage of the intellect's development that conjunction,\nittis\u00e2l, with the Agent Intellect, is experienced, it\nbeing a unification (ittih\u00e2d) of subject and\n object.[64]\n\n\n Averroes struggled more than his\npredecessors with the notion of the potential or \u201cmaterial\u201d\nintellect. In the Epitome of De anima, he presents two positions, at\nfirst following an Alexandrian-Ibn B\u00e2jjahian view that saw the\nmaterial intellect as a disposition in the body or imaginative faculty;\nand then, to guarantee its immaterial objectivity, as a substance\nessentially outside the\n soul.[65]\nThis latter view, reflecting that held by\nThemistius, is the one offered in the Long Commentary, to which he\nrefers the reader in what is an obvious recommendation of the position\nhe there\n holds.[66]\n\n\n Averroes, however, has a third position on\nthe nature of the material intellect. That is the view presented in his\nMiddle Commentary, which he may well have written after the Long\nCommentary, or, as more likely, after a first draft of\n it.[67]\nThe Latin West\nhad only the Long Commentary in translation, and was ignorant of the\nphilosophical alternative view of the material intellect presented in\nthe Middle commentary. Though of importance only to Averroistically\ninclined Jewish philosophers, who read it in Hebrew translation and\nlacked a Hebrew translation of the Long Commentary, the Middle\nCommentary's position has a certain coherence worth noting.\n\n\n As in his initial presentation in the Short\nCommentary, Averroes considers the material intellect, in the Middle\nCommentary, as relating directly to the imaginative faculty, or rather\nto the intelligible intentions to which that corporeal faculty is\ndisposed. Now, however, Averroes emphasizes that this relation to the\nimaginative faculty is \u201cincidental\u201d to the nature of the\nmaterial intellect, its essential relation being with the Agent\nIntellect. The material intellect is a temporary, discrete appearance\nin human beings of the eternal and always actual Agent intellect. It is\nour \u201cfirst perfection,\u201d while the Agent Intellect\nrepresents an ultimate perfection, or \u201cfinal form\u201d\nfor\n us.[68]\n\n\n The Middle Commentary fashions the material\nintellect from a fusion of the views of Alexander of Aphrodisias and\nThemistius. With Alexander, Averroes believes the material or potential\nintellect is a disposition or ability that the soul possesses to\nrepresent imaginative forms as abstract\n intelligibles;[69]\nwhile with Themistius,\nAverroes views the material intellect as a separate immaterial\nsubstance. It is, however, for Averroes in the Middle Commentary, but\nthe substrate of this separate substance, the Agent Intellect being its\nfull and eternally actual expression.\n\n\n In the Long Commentary, Averroes retains\nthe separate, i.e., immaterial yet substantial nature of the material\nand Agent intellects, and their relation of potential to actual\nintelligibility. However, he treats them as two separate substances,\nnot two aspects of the same intelligence. The material intellect is\nthus hypostatized, treated as a \u201cfourth kind of being,\u201d the\ncelestial principle of matter qua potentiality that, together\nwith the formal principle represented by the Agent Intellect, explains\nthe nature and activity of intelligible forms; even as sensible objects\nare constituted by similar hylomorphic\n principles.[70]\n\n\n The Long Commentary thus sees the material\nintellect as \u201cthe last of the separate intellects in the\n(celestial) hierarchy,\u201d following the Agent\n Intellect.[71]\nThis physical\nrelocation of the material intellect may guarantee its incorruptibility\nand objectivity, for Averroes, but it does not explain the presence in\nhuman beings of a rational faculty, a presence that Averroes\nrecognizes. To that purpose, he enlarges the role of cogitation\n(fikr) in the cognitive process. As mentioned above, he sees\nit as a corporeal faculty located in the brain that is able to receive\nand process both the imaginative intentions found in sensation, and the\nintelligible intentions of the imagination, thereby initiating the\nprocess of abstraction and universalization that the material and Agent\nintellects\n complete.[72]\nAverroes also introduces in the Long\nCommentary a \u201cpassible intellect\u201d that has a similar\ncorporeal nature and function, that of bridging the particular and\nuniversal domains of images and\n intelligibles.[73]\n\n\n Yet, for all his attempts in\nthe Long Commentary to distance the material intellect from an\nindividual corruptible body through what may be seen as surrogate\nintellectual powers, Averroes involves the material intellect, and even\nthe Agent Intellect, with a person's intellectual development.\nTheir presence is essential to the individual striving for rational\nperfection, however non-essential from the standpoint of the universal\nsubstances themselves. The location of these immaterial faculties in\nthe soul is nowhere explicit, neither in the Middle or Long\ncommentaries, but their function and internal dynamic is similarly\npresented. The individual perfects his/her intellect, and the more it\nis perfected, i.e., the more abstract truths accumulate, the less\nparticular and individual it is, the less it \u201cbelongs\u201d to\nthat person. Ultimately, a person's fully realized intellect is\nable theoretically to conjoin with the Agent Intellect, all traces of\nindividuality excised.\n\n\n Averroes was aware that very few if any\nindividuals reach intellectual perfection, i.e., mastery of all there\nis to know, and even that person cannot maintain the state of\nconjunction indefinitely, being human and requiring food, drink, and\nnon-intellectual pursuits. So it is that Averroes, in all his\ncommentaries and other writings on the subject, does not deprecate the\nexistence in living beings of intellectual individuation. This was\nthought by many to be denied by Averroes' theory of monopsychism,\nin which there is but one material as well as agent intellect.\n\n\n In one of his minor essays on the topic,\nAverroes portrays the fully realized acquired intellect of a person as\nlosing its identity upon attaining conjunction with the\nAgent\n Intellect,[74]\nbeing totally absorbed in it. This can happen to the rare individual\nwhile alive, though it is a temporary state of being then. Upon the\ndemise of a body, however, the immaterial intellect of every one,\nhowever much or little developed, is enveloped within the one Agent\nIntellect. The contingent and material circumstances that brought the\nindividual to recognize universal truths and which affected the\nparticular composition of that person's soul do not endure, and\nthe universal intelligibles acquired have no substance with which to\nremain other than the Agent Intellect, where they are always\nrepresented.\n\n\n In conclusion, one may say that the\npsychology of the classical Muslim philosophers was torn between\nAristotelian and Neoplatonic perspectives, with attempted syntheses\nthat favored one perspective or another. The naturalism of Aristotle\nwas frequently subverted in the quest for a knowledge of universal\ntruths that promised eternal bliss, however philosophically difficult\nthat concept proved to be.\n",
