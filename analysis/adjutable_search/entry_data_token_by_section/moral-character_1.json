    "main_text": "Some ancient Greek views || Why character matters\n2.1 Why character matters\n\nThe views of moral character held by Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and\nthe Stoics are the starting point for most other philosophical\ndiscussions of character. Although these ancient moralists differed on\nsome issues about virtue, it makes sense to begin with some points of\nsimilarity. These points of similarity will show why the Greek\nmoralists thought it was important to discuss character.\n\nMany of Plato\u2019s dialogues (especially the early or so-called\n\u201cSocratic\u201d dialogues) examine the nature of virtue and the\ncharacter of a virtuous person. They often begin by having Socrates\nask his interlocutors to explain what a particular virtue is. In\nreply, the interlocutors usually offer behavioral accounts of the\nvirtues. For example, at the beginning of Plato\u2019s\nLaches the character Laches suggests that courage consists of\nstanding one\u2019s ground in battle. In the Charmides,\nCharmides suggests that temperance consists in acting quietly. In the\nRepublic, Cephalus suggests that justice consists in giving\nback what one has borrowed. In each of these cases, Plato has Socrates\nreply in the same way. In the Republic Socrates explains that\ngiving back what one has borrowed cannot be what justice is, for there\nare cases where giving back what one has borrowed would be foolish,\nand the just person recognizes that it is foolish. If the person from\nwhom you have borrowed a sword goes mad, it would be foolish for you\nto return the sword, for you are then putting yourself and others in\ndanger. The implication is that the just person can recognize when it\nis reasonable to return what he has borrowed. Similarly, as Socrates\nexplains in the Laches, standing firm in battle cannot be\ncourage, for sometimes standing firm in battle is simply a foolish\nendurance that puts oneself and others at needless risk. The\ncourageous person can recognize when it is reasonable to stand his\nground in battle and when it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe trouble one encounters in trying to give a purely behavioral\naccount of virtue explains why the Greek moralists turn to character\nto explain what virtue is. It may be true that most of us can\nrecognize that it would be foolish to risk our lives and the lives of\nothers to secure a trivial benefit, and that most of us can see that\nit is unjust to harm others to secure power and wealth for our own\ncomfort. We don\u2019t have to be virtuous to recognize these things.\nBut the Greek moralists think it takes someone of good moral character\nto determine with regularity and reliability what actions are\nappropriate and reasonable in fearful situations and that it takes\nsomeone of good moral character to determine with regularity and\nreliability how and when to secure goods and resources for himself and\nothers. This is why Aristotle states in Nicomachean Ethics\nII.9 that it is not easy to define in rules which actions deserve\nmoral praise and blame, and that these matters require the judgment of\nthe virtuous person.\n",
