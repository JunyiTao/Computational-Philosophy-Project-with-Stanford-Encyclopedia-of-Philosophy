    "main_text": "Desert and Intrinsic Value\n4. Desert and Intrinsic Value\n\nHere is a natural and appealing idea: it is a good thing when people\nget what they deserve. If I am distributing raises, and only Jones\ndeserves a raise, then it would be better for me to give the raise to\nJones than to anyone else.\n\nAs simple and straightforward as this idea is, given certain\nbackground assumptions it raises difficult questions about the\nconnection between desert and \u201cgoodness,\u201d or intrinsic\nvalue. \n\nSome consequentialist moral theories make use of (and so presuppose\nthe intelligibility of) the notion of the \u201cintrinsic value of a\nstate of affairs,\u201d or the \u201cintrinsic value of a possible\nworld.\u201d This notion of intrinsic value is a quantitative one:\nconsequentialists usually assume that we can choose a unit for\nmeasuring intrinsic value, and in terms of that unit we can say that\nthe intrinsic value of one possible world is 100 units, while the\nintrinsic value of another is, say, merely 10 units. \n\nCommon forms of consequentialism go on to say that whether an action A\nis permissible or impermissible is determined by how the intrinsic\nvalue of the world that would be actual if A were performed compares\nto the intrinsic values of the worlds that would be actual if the\nalternatives to A were performed instead. (The alternatives to A are\nthe actions other than A that are \u201copen\u201d to the agent at\nthe time he performs A.) One standard form of consequentialism says\nthat an act A is permissible if and only if none of the worlds that\nwould be actual were the agent to perform one of the alternatives to A\nhas a greater intrinsic value than the world that would be actual were\nhe to perform A. Thus, in a consequentialist framework, if one holds\nthat facts about desert make a difference to intrinsic value, one may\nalso hold that facts about desert make a difference to whether an act\nis permissible or impermissible. If, in virtue of the fact that only\nJones deserves a raise, it is better to give a raise only to Jones,\nthen the right thing to do is to give the raise only to Jones. \n\nThis section started with the generalization that, other things being\nequal, it is a good thing when people get what they deserve. We have\njust seen that in a consequentialist framework this generalization\nabout value leads naturally to another one, about moral obligation:\nother things being equal, one ought to ensure that people get what\nthey deserve. But one might endorse the second generalization without\nthe first. Some opponents of consequentialism hold that talk of\n\u201cthe intrinsic value of a possible world\u201d makes no sense\n(for example, Thomson 2008). They could still accept that, other\nthings being equal, one ought to ensure that people get what they\ndeserve. One could hold, for example, that the obligation to ensure\nthat people get what they deserve is a prima facie duty, in\nthe sense that W. D. Ross (2002) attaches to this phrase. \n\nSome consequentialists have hoped that basing their theory of\nobligation on a \u201cdesert-sensitive\u201d theory of intrinsic\nvalue will make their theory immune to certain common objections. To\nget a sense of what these philosophers hope to accomplish we will need\na more detailed statement of a theory of intrinsic value. We will make\nuse of the notion of individual welfare, or well-being. Talk of\nsomeone\u2019s well-being is talk of how good their life is for them.\nWe may speak of how good someone\u2019s life is at a particular\nmoment, or how good their life is as a whole; our focus here is on\nwelfare-values of entire lives. Let us assume, as is common in\ndiscussions of desert, that welfare is a quantitative notion. We can\nchoose a unit for measuring welfare; then for each person there is,\nrelative to that choice of unit, a number that represents how good\nthat person\u2019s life is for them. One simple\n(non-desert-sensitive) theory of intrinsic value for possible worlds\nsays that the (number representing) the intrinsic value of a world is\nequal to the sum of the numbers representing the \u201cwelfare\nvalues\u201d of the lives of the people in that world. \n\nAccording to standard consequentialism, combined with this theory of\nintrinsic value, \u201cdistribution does not matter.\u201d All that\nmatters, for determining whether an act is right, is the sum total of\nthe welfare in the world that would be actual if that act were\nperformed, and how that sum total differs from the totals in the\nworlds that would be actual if some alternative act were performed; it\ndoes not matter how good any particular individual\u2019s life is.\nJohn Rawls famously argued that this is an objectionable feature of\nthe theory (Rawls 1971, 26; his target is a slightly different theory\nof intrinsic value). \n\nA desert-adjusted theory of intrinsic value might yield a version of\nstandard consequentialism that evades this objection. If worlds in\nwhich people get what they deserve are better than worlds in which\npeople do not, then it is not true that distribution does not matter.\nA desert-adjusted theory of intrinsic value could say that, if Smith\nand Jones each deserves 25 units of welfare, then a world in which\nthey each receive 25 units is better than a world in which Smith\nreceives 50 and Jones receives 0. \n\nFeldman (1995a, 567) is explicit that the goal of his desert-sensitive\nversion of consequentialism is to respond to Rawls\u2019 objection.\nHe suggests that his theory can handle many of the examples commonly\nthought to raise problems for consequentialism, such as the Organ\nTransplant. In another paper Feldman suggests that a desert-adjusted\ntheory of intrinsic value can avoid Parfit\u2019s Repugnant\nConclusion (see Feldman 1995c; for the Repugnant Conclusion, see\nParfit 1984; for reservations about Feldman\u2019s response to\nRawls\u2019 objection, and an alternative, see McLeod 2006). \n\nWhat might a desert-adjusted theory of intrinsic value, one that might\nform the basis for a desert-sensitive version of consequentialism,\nlook like? To evaluate desert-adjusted theories of intrinsic value we\nneed to see them stated at a greater level of detail than we have seen\nso far. Presumably, if it is a good thing when people get what they\ndeserve, then if the people in world w1 are closer\nto getting what they deserve than the people in world\nw2, w1 is better (has a greater\nintrinsic value) than w2 (other things being equal).\nBut, again, intrinsic value is a quantitative notion. So it makes\nsense to ask: how much better is w1 than\nw2? 10 units? 100 units? Even if we say a lot more\nabout what worlds w1 and w2 are\nlike, the answers to these questions are not obvious. \n\nTo make a start let us go back to an assumption we quietly made three\nparagraphs back: that welfare levels are among the things that people\ndeserve. This claim does not seem controversial. It follows from the\ncommon idea that the wicked deserve to suffer, and the saintly deserve\nto prosper, for to prosper is to have a relatively high welfare level.\nBut philosophers who attempt to formulate (welfarist) desert-sensitive\ntheories of intrinsic value often make a stronger assumption: that\nwhen it comes to determining the intrinsic value of a possible world,\nall that matters is the extent to which people get the\nwelfare levels they deserve. Suppose I deserve an apology from my\nneighbor in virtue of the fact that he (inadvertently) tore up some of\nthe plants in my yard. But suppose also that I do not really care\nabout my yard, or about the quality of my relationship with my\nneighbor. Getting the apology would mean nothing to me, nor would I be\nupset if my neighbor did not apologize. The apology would not make my\nlife better or worse. Then on the stronger assumption, the intrinsic\nvalue of the world is not higher if I get the apology than if I\ndon\u2019t \u2013 even though only if I get the apology do I get\nsomething I deserve. \n\nOne possible justification for this assumption goes as follows. Even\nthough we may deserve all sorts of things, only instances of\nsomeone\u2019s deserving a certain welfare level are instances of\n\u201cmoral desert.\u201d And only moral desert\n\u201cmatters\u201d for the intrinsic value of a possible world. A\ntheory that says the world is no better if I get that apology is not\nfalse-but-legitimately-oversimplified. It is saying the truth.\nAccording to this line of thought, it is not, in fact, always better\nwhen people get what they deserve. It is only better if they get what\nthey morally deserve. (Shelly Kagan focuses on moral desert,\npresumably to the exclusion of other kinds of desert, in chapter 1 of\nhis 2012.) \n\nJustified or not, most work on desert-sensitive theories of intrinsic\nvalue does assume that the only instances of desert that matter are\ninstances of deserved welfare. What should a desert-sensitive theory\nof intrinsic value that makes this assumption look like? If the value\nof a possible world is a function, not just of the welfare levels of\nthe people in that world, but also of the welfare levels they deserve,\njust which function is it? \n\nProducing a theory that answers this question and is initially\nplausible is not easy. One way to approach the problem is to start\nwith another simplifying assumption. The simple non-desert-sensitive\ntheory of intrinsic value stated above is \u201ctotalist\u201d; the\nintrinsic value of a possible world is got by summing up\n\u201ccontributions\u201d made by each individual\n\u201cseparately.\u201d The amount of intrinsic value contributed by\nan individual is equal to (or proportional to) that person\u2019s\nwelfare level. We could try for a desert-sensitive theory that is also\ntotalist. The contribution made by an individual will not (or not\nalways) be equal to their welfare level; the amount they deserve will\nalso be relevant. Still, the value of the world as a whole will just\nbe the sum of the individual contributions.\n\nHere is a sketch of a theory like this. It treats someone\u2019s\ndesert level as a \u201cmultiplier.\u201d The value an individual\ncontributes to the intrinsic value of a possible world is equal to the\nproduct of the welfare level they receive in that world and the\nwelfare level they deserve. (A more sophisticated treatment of the\nidea of \u201cdesert-as-multiplier\u201d may be found in Kagan 2012,\nsection 2.4.) \n\nThis theory says plausible things about simple cases. If Smith\ndeserves 10 units of welfare and Jones deserves 20, and you can either\nensure that Smith receives 10 units, or that Jones receives 10 units,\nthe theory says that it is better to ensure that Jones receives the 10\nunits. For if Smith receives the welfare, the total value of the world\nwill be equal to 100, while if Jones does, the total value will be\nequal to 200. These facts are summarized in the table below (the\nmultiplications in the contribution columns are \u201cwelfare level\ntimes desert level\u201d): \n\n\nWho gets the welfare?\nSmith\u2019s contribution\nJones\u2019s contribution\nTotal value\n\nSmith\n10 \u00d7 10 = 100\n0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n100\n\nJones\n0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n10 \u00d7 20 = 200\n200\n\n\nThe idea behind using deserved welfare levels as multipliers is that\nthe welfare of more deserving people is worth more than that of less\ndeserving people. As far as the quality of the lives of the\nindividuals involved are concerned, 10 units of welfare is 10 units of\nwelfare, no matter who it \u201cgoes to\u201d: if Smith\u2019s life\nis made better by 10 units of welfare, his life is made better by the\nsame amount as if Jones\u2019 life is made better by 10 units. But as\nfar as the world is concerned, it does make a difference who\nthe 10 units goes to. When 10 units of welfare goes to someone highly\ndeserving, someone who deserves a high welfare level, the value of\nthat 10 units is \u201caugmented,\u201d so that 10 units of welfare\ncorresponds to a much larger number of units of value-for-the-world.\n\n\nWhile the desert-as-multiplier idea gets some cases right, it gets\nother cases very wrong. Think again of Smith and Jones, deserving 10\nand 20 units of welfare, respectively. Suppose that, if you do\nnothing, Jones will live a life worth 100 units, and Smith will live a\nlife worth 0 units. Your only two options are to act so that Jones\nlives a life worth 110 and Smith \u201cstays where he would have\nbeen\u201d (he lives a life worth 0), or act so that Jones stays\nwhere he would have been, and Smith lives a life worth 10. The table\nbelow shows the values of the worlds that correspond to each of your\noptions, according to this theory:\n\n\nOption \nSmith\u2019s contribution\nJones\u2019 contribution\nTotal value\n\nDo nothing\n0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n100 \u00d7 20 = 2000\n2000\n\nAugment Smith \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n10 \u00d7 10 = 100\n100 \u00d7 20 = 2000\n2100\n\nAugment Jones\n0 \u00d7 10 = 0\n110 \u00d7 20 = 2200\n2200\n\n\nThe theory says you should augment Jones. This is implausible. Even if\nyou do nothing, Jones will be living a life far better than the one he\ndeserves to be living. What sense is there in making his life better,\nwhen instead you could cause Smith to be living a life he deserves,\nrather than one worse than he\n deserves?[3]\n\n\nIt seems wrong to multiply every bit of welfare Jones receives by 20,\neven bits of welfare that put him way above the level of welfare he\ndeserves, when computing his contribution to the intrinsic value of\nthe world. This failure of the desert-as-multiplier view suggests an\nalternative mathematical role for deserved welfare levels. What is\nimportant is not the welfare level you deserve, but how close\nyou are to the welfare level you deserve: how good the\n\u201cfit\u201d is between what you get and what you deserve. A\nnatural way to measure fit is to look at the distance between what you\nget and what you deserve: the absolute value of the difference between\nyour welfare level and your deserved welfare level. (So when Jones\ndeserves 20 units and gets 100, his \u201cfit value\u201d is the\nnumber 80.) \n\nHaving latched on to the importance of fit values, how should we make\nuse to them? The simplest way to implement the idea that \u2018the\ncloser one is to getting what one deserves, the better\u2019 defines\nthe contribution made to intrinsic value by an individual as follows:\n\n \nContribution = welfare level \u2212 fit value.\n\n\nThe minus sign is there because someone\u2019s fit value goes up as\ntheir welfare level gets farther away from their deserved welfare\nlevel. Thus increases in the fit value correspond to worse states of\naffairs; so we want fit values to make a negative impact on\ncontributions. \n\nThis new theory gives a plausible judgment about our second\nSmith/Jones case. Here are the values it assigns: \n\n\nOption\nSmith\u2019s contribution\nJones\u2019 contribution\nTotal value\n\n\nDo nothing \n\u00a00 \u2212 |10\u22120| = \u221210 \n100 \u2212 |20\u2212100| = 20 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n10 \n\n\nAugment Smith \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n10 \u2212 |10\u221210| = 10 \n100 \u2212 |20\u2212100| = 20 \n30 \n\n\nAugment Jones \n\u00a00 \u2212 |10\u22120| = \u221210 \n110 \u2212 |20\u2212110| = 20 \n10 \n\n\n\nPhilosophers have articulated other principles they think a\ndesert-sensitive theory of value should entail, and have proposed yet\nmore complicated \u201ccontribution formulas\u201d as parts of\ntheories of that sort. For example, Eric Carlson holds that if you\nhave a bunch of people with the same desert level, and you \u201chave\na fixed amount of welfare to distribute between them\u201d (really,\nin each world that you can \u201cmake actual\u201d the sum of their\nwelfare levels is the same), then the world in which they all receive\nthe same welfare level should have the greatest intrinsic value. Equal\nlevels of welfare are best, when everyone is equally deserving. The\ntheory we just described is incompatible with this idea. (For\nCarlson\u2019s theory, which does entail this principle, see Carlson\n1997. Feldman 1995a articulated many ideas about how intrinsic values\nshould be adjusted to take desert into account. Persson 1997\ndistinguished the idea of desert as a multiplier (he called it the\n\u201cmerit idea\u201d) from the idea that what matters is the fit\nbetween desert and receipt; he sees both ideas at work in\nFeldman\u2019s paper. Other constraints people have wanted to place\non a desert-sensitive theory may be found in Carlson 1997, Arrhenius\n2006, and Skow 2012.) \n\nThe theories we have discussed so far aim to be \u201coverall\u201d\ntheories of intrinsic value, theories of intrinsic value all things\nconsidered, even if they may make some simplifying assumptions about\nwhat is valuable. Another approach to theorizing about desert aims to\ndo something different. Shelly Kagan, in his book The Geometry of\nDesert (2012), aims at a theory of \u201cintrinsic value from\nthe perspective of desert.\u201d To have a complete theory of\nintrinsic value one would have to take Kagan\u2019s theory and find a\nway to combine it with theories of value from other perspectives. \n\nKagan\u2019s book is by far the most comprehensive discussion of the\nrole of desert in the theory of value. He discusses both\n\u201cnoncomparative desert\u201d and \u201ccomparative\ndesert.\u201d Without trying to be too precise about this\ndistinction, comparative desert concerns how the fit between one\nperson\u2019s welfare level and desert level compares to that of\nothers; noncomparative desert ignores these comparisons. His theory of\nnoncomparative desert comprises several claims, the core of which are\nthese: \n\nIt is best, from the perspective of noncomparative desert, when\nsomeone gets exactly the welfare level they deserve. (That is, a world\nin which he gets exactly what he deserves is better than a world in\nwhich he gets more or less, other things being equal.)\nIf someone has a positive desert level, then it is better, from the\nperspective of noncomparative desert, if they get more than they\ndeserve, than if they get less (by the same amount); moreover, the\ndegree to which it is better to get more than one deserves increases\nas one\u2019s desert level increases. The opposite is true if someone\nhas a negative desert level.\n\n\nThe image below illustrates these claims. Each \u201cmountain\u201d\nplots an individual\u2019s value, from the perspective of\nnon-comparative desert, as a function of their welfare level. The\n\u201cpeak\u201d of a person\u2019s mountain sits directly above\nthe welfare level that person (non-comparatively) deserves; this\nillustrates claim 1, that things are best when someone gets they\nwelfare level they deserve. Note also that the mountain on the\nleft-hand side of the y-axis has a steeper eastern slope than western\nslope. This illustrates part of claim 2. It indicates that if you\ncould either overcompensate a person who deserves a negative amount of\nwelfare, or undercompensate him, by the same amount, it is better to\nundercompensate him. The mountain on the right-hand side of the y-axis\nillustrates the corresponding claim about someone with \u201cpositive\ndesert\u201d: it is better to overcompensate than to undercompensate\nsuch a person. The image also illustrates a claim that Kagan calls\n\u201cBell Motion\u201d (this claim is also part of 2): the\nmountains \u201cswing\u201d in a counter-clockwise direction, as\nthey move from left to right in the diagram. Mountains farther to the\nright have shallower eastern slopes and steeper western slopes. This\nmeans, among other things, that if you have to overcompensate one\nperson by a fixed amount, it is best to overcompensate the person with\nthe highest desert level. Overcompensating makes things worse from the\nperspective of non-comparative desert; overcompensating the most\ndeserving person is, however, less bad, brings about a smaller\nvertical drop in the graph, than overcompensating anyone else would.\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nSo far we have been discussing Kagan\u2019s theory of non-comparative\ndesert. His theory of comparative desert is meant to answer questions\nlike the following: suppose that there are two people, that one of\nthem is getting more welfare than he deserves, and that there is\nnothing we can do about that. What must the welfare level of the other\nperson be, if the demands of comparative desert are to be perfectly\nsatisfied? Kagan advocates what he calls the \u201cY-gap\u201d view.\nThe image below illustrates this view. Suppose that the mountain on\nthe left represents the person whose welfare level we cannot control,\nand the mountain on the right represents the person whose welfare\nlevel we can control. Then we should overcompensate the person on the\nright by that amount which results in his Y-gap being the same as that\nof the person on the left. A person\u2019s Y-gap is the vertical\ndistance between the peak of his mountain, and his actual location (in\nthis case) on the eastern slope. The vertical bars in the diagram\ndepict the two Y-gaps. In this case, although the person on the left\nis over-compensated by amount A, the person on the right must be\nover-compensated by a greater amount B, to achieve the same Y-gap, and\nso to perfectly satisfy the demands of comparative desert, as Kagan\nsees them. \n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nOne question about Kagan\u2019s theory is, what exactly are we\nmeasuring when we measure intrinsic value from the perspective of\ndesert? In his book Kagan remains agnostic about whether it is better\nif a more deserving person gets exactly what he deserves than if a\nless deserving person does. Maybe this is better; but maybe, on the\nother hand, a situation in which someone who deserves a high welfare\nlevel gets exactly what he deserves is just as good as a situation in\nwhich someone who deserves a low (but still positive) welfare gets\nexactly what he deserves (2012, section 4.3). However, on one natural\nunderstanding of the perspective of desert, there is not much room for\ndebate here. It is natural to think that \u2018from the perspective\nof desert,\u2026\u2019 just means \u2018taking into account only\nhow close people are to getting what they deserve,\u2026\u2019 If\nthis is right then it is obvious that a situation in which someone who\ndeserves a welfare level of 50 and gets a welfare level of 50 is just\nas good, from the perspective of desert, as a situation in which\nsomeone who deserves a welfare level of 200 gets a welfare level of\n200. (One who held this view can, of course, say that in another sense\nthe second situation is better: it is better all-things-considered,\nbecause the total amount of welfare in that situation is higher.) The\nfact that Kagan does not think it obvious that the two situations are\nequally good from the perspective of desert is evidence that he\nrejects this account of what the perspective of desert is. (For more\non this question about Kagan\u2019s theory, see Appendix I of Feldman\n2003, and Skow 2014.) \n",
