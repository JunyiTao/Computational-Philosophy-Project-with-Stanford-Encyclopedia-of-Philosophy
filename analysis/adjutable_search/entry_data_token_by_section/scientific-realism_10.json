    "main_text": "Antirealism: Foils for Scientific Realism || Empiricism\n4.1 Empiricism\n\nThe term \u201cantirealism\u201d (or \u201canti-realism\u201d)\nencompasses any position that is opposed to realism along one or more\nof the dimensions canvassed in\n section 1.2:\n the metaphysical commitment to the existence of a mind-independent\nreality; the semantic commitment to interpret theories literally or at\nface value; and the epistemological commitment to regard theories as\nfurnishing knowledge of both observables and unobservables. As a\nresult, and as one might expect, there are many different ways to be\nan antirealist, and many different positions qualify as antirealism\n(cf. Kitcher 2001: 161\u2013163). In the historical development of\nrealism, arguably the most important strains of antirealism have been\nvarieties of empiricism which, given their emphasis on experience as a\nsource and subject matter of knowledge, are naturally set against the\nidea of knowledge of unobservables. It is possible to be an empiricist\nmore broadly speaking in a way that is consistent with\nrealism\u2014for example, one might endorse the idea that knowledge\nof the world stems from empirical investigation and contend that on\nthis basis, one can justifiably infer certain things about\nunobservables. In the first half of the twentieth century, however,\nempiricism came predominantly in the form of varieties of\n\u201cinstrumentalism\u201d: the view that theories are merely\ninstruments for predicting observable phenomena or systematizing\nobservation reports.\n\nAccording to the best known, traditional form of instrumentalism,\nterms for unobservables have no meaning all by themselves; construed\nliterally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth\nor falsity (cf. a more recent proposal in Rowbottom 2011). The most\ninfluential advocates of this view were the logical empiricists (or\nlogical positivists), including Carnap and Hempel, famously associated\nwith the Vienna Circle group of philosophers and scientists as well as\nimportant contributors elsewhere. In order to rationalize the\nubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to\nunobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal\nsemantics according to which these terms acquire meaning by being\nassociated with terms for observables (for example,\n\u201celectron\u201d might mean \u201cwhite streak in a cloud\nchamber\u201d), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view\ncalled \u201coperationalism\u201d). Insuperable difficulties with\nthis semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of\nlogical empiricism and the growth of realism. The contrast here is not\nmerely in semantics and epistemology: a number of logical empiricists\nalso held the neo-Kantian view that ontological questions\n\u201cexternal\u201d to the frameworks for knowledge represented by\ntheories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made\nsolely on pragmatic grounds), thereby rejecting the metaphysical\ndimension of realism (as in Carnap 1950). (Duhem [1906] 1954 was\ninfluential with respect to instrumentalism; for a critique of logical\nempiricist semantics, see H. Brown 1977: ch. 3; on logical empiricism\nmore generally, see Giere & Richardson 1997 and Richardson &\nUebel 2007; on the neo-Kantian reading, see Richardson 1998 and\nFriedman 1999.)\n\nVan Fraassen (1980) reinvented empiricism in the scientific context,\nevading many of the challenges faced by logical empiricism by adopting\na realist semantics. His position, \u201cconstructive\nempiricism\u201d, holds that the aim of science is empirical\nadequacy, where \u201ca theory is empirically adequate exactly if\nwhat it says about the observable things and events in the world, is\ntrue\u201d (1980: 12; p. 64 gives a more technical definition in\nterms of the embedding of observable structures in scientific models).\nCrucially, unlike logical empiricism, constructive empiricism\ninterprets theories in precisely the same manner as realism. The\nantirealism of the position is due entirely to its\nepistemology\u2014it recommends belief in our best theories only\ninsofar as they describe observable phenomena, and is satisfied with\nan agnostic attitude regarding anything unobservable. The constructive\nempiricist thus recognizes claims about unobservables as true or\nfalse, but feels no need to believe or disbelieve them. In focusing on\nbelief in the domain of the observable, the position is similar to\ntraditional instrumentalism, and is for this reason sometimes\ndescribed as a form of instrumentalism. (For elaborations of the view,\nsee van Fraassen 1985, 2001 and Rosen 1994.) There are also affinities\nhere with the idea of fictionalism, according to which things in the\nworld are and behave as if our best scientific theories are\ntrue (Vaihinger [1911] 1923; Fine 1993).\n",
