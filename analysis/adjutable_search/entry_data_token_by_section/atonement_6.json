    "main_text": "How to Atone || Giving a True Account\n2.3 Giving a True Account\n\nTo give a true account of a wrong is to accurately describe what\nhappened and to explain the motivations, intents, desires, passions,\nand thinking behind the wrong action. Ideally, the wrongdoer would\ncome to understand a true and relatively complete account of their\nwrongdoing and communicate that understanding to the victim, who would\nthen incorporate it into their own understanding of the event. In this\nideal situation, the understanding and exchange of a true account of\nthe wrongdoing helps bring about reconciliation. First, for the\noffender to repent and genuinely apologize, he needs to be aware of\nthe extent of his culpability for the wrong action and this awareness\nrequires something approaching a true account of his\n action.[18]\n For similar reasons, an offender\u2019s awareness of a true account\nof their wrongdoing assists in personal moral reformation and\ntransformation, which can also atone.\n\nSecond, victims can experience a variety of negative consequences that\nresult due in part to a lack of awareness of a true account of the\nwrongdoing (Volf 2006). Victims are often confused about why someone\nwould wrong them in the way they did. This confusion can be\nintrinsically painful. Worse, victims often feel that they are in some\nway to blame for the event, or feel shame at having been victimized.\nLacking a true account of what happened, victims can also feel greater\nfear of being victimized again without any good idea of how to prevent\nit from happening. Receiving a true account of the wrong action from\nthe offender can help heal these negative consequences. \u201cIt\ntakes knowing the truth to be set free from the psychic injury caused\nby wrongdoing\u201d (Volf 2006: 75).\n\nThird, it is difficult enough to know why we ourselves do what we do,\nbut even more difficult to know why someone else does what they do.\nAnd when we have been victimized, it can be immensely tempting to\nreconstruct an account of what happened that demonizes the offender.\nWe can hold offenders more culpable than they deserve. We can fail to\nsympathize with their personal weaknesses and circumstances which have\nled them to form poor adaptational strategies (M. Adams 1991), and\nwith common human frailties we share (Garrard & McNaughton 2010).\nVictims can thus, understandably and often nonculpably, form views of\nthe offender that erect a barrier to reconciliation. By giving a true\naccount, wrongdoers can help break down this barrier to\nreconciliation, thus atoning for their wrongdoing.\n",
