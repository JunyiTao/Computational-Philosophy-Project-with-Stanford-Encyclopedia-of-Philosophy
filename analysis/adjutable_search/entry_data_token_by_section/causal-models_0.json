    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nCausal modeling is an interdisciplinary field that has its origin in\nthe statistical revolution of the 1920s, especially in the work of the\nAmerican biologist and statistician Sewall Wright (1921). Important\ncontributions have come from computer science, econometrics,\nepidemiology, philosophy, statistics, and other disciplines. Given the\nimportance of causation to many areas of philosophy, there has been\ngrowing philosophical interest in the use of mathematical causal\nmodels. Two major works\u2014Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000\n(abbreviated SGS), and Pearl 2009\u2014have been particularly\ninfluential.\n\nA causal model makes predictions about the behavior of a system. In\nparticular, a causal model entails the truth value, or the\nprobability, of counterfactual claims about the system; it predicts\nthe effects of interventions; and it entails the probabilistic\ndependence or independence of variables included in the model. Causal\nmodels also facilitate the inverse of these inferences: if we have\nobserved probabilistic correlations among variables, or the outcomes\nof experimental interventions, we can determine which causal models\nare consistent with these observations. The discussion will focus\non what it is possible to do in \u201cin principle\u201d. For\nexample, we will consider the extent to which we can infer the correct\ncausal structure of a system, given perfect information about the\nprobability distribution over the variables in the system. This\nignores the very real problem of inferring the true probabilities from\nfinite sample data. In addition, the entry will discuss the application of\ncausal models to the logic of counterfactuals, the analysis of\ncausation, and decision theory.\n",
