The light spreads out\nfrom its source, but does not diminish its source. Similarly, the\ngeneration of emanated entities and hypostases in no way diminishes\nthe source of each emanation. Israeli accounts for the increasing\ncorporeality and particularity and imperfection of each emanated\nhypostasis by adding the idea of shadow or shade to emanation. Each\nemanated hypostasis has a lighter region closer to the source of its\nemanation, but it also contains regions of shade or shadow in areas\nfurther from their source. It is in these shaded regions that the\nemanation of the next sequential entity begins. Further, each emanated\nhypostasis receives light from its source but also shadow, which grows\ndenser as the ontological distance from the source of emanation\nincreases.\n",
