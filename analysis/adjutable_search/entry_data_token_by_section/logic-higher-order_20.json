    "main_text": "Higher Order Logic vis-\u00e0-vis Type Theory\n12. Higher Order Logic vis-\u00e0-vis Type Theory\n\nThere are many ways to further extend second-order logic. The most\nobvious is third, fourth, and so on order logic. The general\nprinciple, already recognized by Tarski (1933 [1956]), is that in\nhigher order logic one can formalize the semantics\u2014define\ntruth\u2014of lower order logic. Therefore one certainly gains\nexpressive power by using higher order logic. Let us take number\ntheory as an example. With first order logic we can express properties\nsuch as \u201cn is a prime number\u201d and propositions such\nas \u201cthere are infinitely many prime numbers\u201d,\nFermat\u2019s Last Theorem and Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture. First\norder properties of natural numbers fall into a natural hierarchy\ncalled the arithmetical hierarchy the levels of which are\ndenoted \\(\\Sigma^0_n\\) and \\(\\Pi^0_n\\). With second-order logic we can\ntalk about properties of sets of natural numbers, or in other words,\nproperties of real numbers. In particular, we can define the\nrationals. A continuous function on the real numbers is determined by\nits values on rationals. Also, an open set is determined by which\nrational points it contains. Using these observations we can talk\nabout continuous functions and open sets of reals. Basic facts in\ncalculus, such as Bolzano\u2019s Theorem stating that \u201cIf a\ncontinuous function has values of opposite sign inside an interval,\nthen it has a root in that interval\u201d are expressible in\nsecond-order logic over the structure \\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\) of natural\nnumbers. Second-order properties of natural numbers fall into a\nnatural hierarchy called the analytical hierarchy and its\nlevels are denoted \\(\\Sigma^1_n\\) and \\(\\Pi^1_n\\). With third order\nlogic we can talk about sets of real numbers. We can write\nthe Continuum Hypothesis in third order logic and ask the hard\nquestion, whether the model \\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\) satisfies this sentence.\nThird order properties of natural numbers have again a natural\nhierarchy and its levels are denoted \\(\\Sigma^2_n\\) and\n\\(\\Pi^2_n\\).\n\nIt is obvious that if we keep a base model, such as \\((\\oN,+,\\cdot)\\)\nfixed, and move to higher and higher order logic, we can express more\nand more complicated concepts and propositions. However,\nthird order logic over  \n\n\\[\\mn_1=(\\oN,+,\\cdot)\n\\]\n\n\nis nothing more than second order logic over \n\n\\[\\mn_2=(\\P(\\oN),E,\\oN,+,\\cdot),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(E\\subseteq \\oN\\times\\P(\\oN)\\) is the relation \\(nEr\\iff n\\in\nr\\), which again is nothing more than first order logic over\n \n\n\\[\\mn_3=(\\P(\\P(\\oN))),E',\\P(\\oN),E,\\oN,+,\\cdot),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(E'\\subseteq \\P(\\oN)\\times\\P(\\P(\\oN)\\) is the relation\n\\(rE'X\\iff r\\in X\\). Moreover, second-order logic over \\(\\mn_1\\) is\nnothing more than first order logic over \\(\\mn_2\\). When this line of\nthought is taken to its limit we can see that first order logic over\nthe cumulative hierarchy of sets covers higher order logic over any\nindividual level \\(V_\\alpha\\) of the hierarchy. In a sense, first\norder logic over the cumulative hierarchy of sets is a very very high\norder logic over \\(\\mn_1\\).\n\nThere is a marked similarity in the way \\(\\mn_2\\) arises from\n\\(\\mn_1\\) and in the way \\(\\mn_3\\) arises from \\(\\mn_2\\). In both\ncases we simply add a power set construction on top of what the model\nalready has. Second-order logic alone is very good with power sets as\nwe saw in\n \u00a75.3.\n A consequence of this is that all the higher order logics (of any\nfinite order and up to a point also of infinite order) from\nsecond-order on have Turing-equivalent decision problems and the same\nHanf- and L\u00f6wenheim numbers (see\n \u00a74).\n Thus, even though higher than second-order logics are strictly\nspeaking stronger than second-order logic no difference can be seen by\nthe usual criteria of strength of expressive power.\n\nType theory is a systematic approach to higher order logics.\nVariables are assigned types just as in second-order logic we have\nvariables for individual type, relation type and function type. In a\nhigher order logic it would make sense to have variables for relations\nbetween objects of any lower types as well as functions mapping\nobjects of lower type to objects of lower type. In set theory objects\nhave a rank. Elements of a set have a lower rank than the set itself.\nHowever, the difference between set-theoretical rank and typing in\ntype theory is that in set theory the rank can be computed when the\nset is known while in type theory the type of an object can be seen\nfrom the type of the variable that the object is the value of. In a\nsense type theory imposes from the syntax a type for each object\nconsidered while in set theory a set has a rank given by the\nsemantics. Arguably set theory gained dominance over type theory after\nthe 1930s because of its simpler syntax and semantics. On the other\nhand type theory is used in computer science, especially in the theory\nof programming languages (see SEP entry on\n type theory).\n\n",
