    "main_text": "Jus in Bello || Killing Combatants\n4.2 Killing Combatants\n\nJust war theory has meaning only if we can explain why killing some\ncombatants in war is allowed, but we are not thereby licensed to kill\neveryone in the enemy state. Here the competing forces of realism and\npacifism are at their most compelling. It is unsurprising, therefore,\nthat so much recent work has focused on this topic. We cannot do\njustice to all the arguments here, but will instead consider three kinds of\nresponse: all-out revisionist; moderate traditionalist; and all-out\ntraditionalist.\n\nThe first camp faces two challenges: to justify intentionally killing\napparently non-liable unjust combatants; but to do this without\nreopening the door to Combatant Equality, or indeed further\nundermining Discrimination. Their main move is to argue that, despite\nappearances, all and only unjust combatants are in fact liable to be\nkilled.\n\nMcMahan argues that liability to be killed need not, in fact,\npresuppose responsibility for an unjustified threat. Instead, unjust\ncombatants\u2019 responsibility for just combatants\u2019 reasonable\nbeliefs that they are liable may be enough to ground forfeiture of their rights\n(McMahan 2011a). Some argue that combatants\u2019 responsibility for\nbeing in the wrong place at the wrong time is enough (likening them to\nvoluntary human\n shields).[22]\n More radically still, some philosophers abandon the insistence on\nindividual responsibility, arguing that unjust combatants are\ncollectively responsible for contributing to unjustified threats, even\nif they are individually ineffective (or even counterproductive) (Kamm\n2004; Bazargan 2013).\n\nLazar (forthcoming-a) suggests these arguments are\nunpersuasive. Complicity might be relevant to the costs one is\nrequired to bear in war, but most liberals will baulk at the idea of\nlosing one\u2019s right to life in virtue of things that other people\ndid. And if combatants can be complicitously liable for what their\ncomrades-in-arms did, then why shouldn\u2019t noncombatants be\ncomplicitously liable also?\n\nBlameworthy responsibility for other people\u2019s false beliefs does\nseem relevant to the ethics of self- and other-defence. That said,\nconsider an idiot who pretends to be a suicide bomber as a prank, and\nis shot by a police officer (Ferzan 2005; McMahan 2005c). Is killing\nhim objectively permissible? It seems doubtful. The officer\u2019s justified\nbelief that the prankster posed a threat clearly diminishes the\nwrongfulness of killing him (Lazar 2015a). And certainly the\nprankster\u2019s fault excuses the officer of any guilt. But killing\nthe prankster still seems objectively wrong. Even if someone\u2019s\nblameworthy responsibility for false beliefs could make killing him\nobjectively permissible, most philosophers agree that many unjust\ncombatants are not to blame for the injustice of their wars (McMahan\n1994; Lazar 2010). And it is much less plausible that\nblameless responsibility for beliefs can make one a permissible\ntarget. Even if it did, this would count in favour of moderate\nCombatant Equality, since most just combatants are also blamelessly\nresponsible for unjust combatants\u2019 reasonable beliefs that they\nare liable to be killed.\n\nModerate traditionalists think we can avoid the realist and pacifist\nhorns of the responsibility dilemma only by conceding a moderate form\nof Combatant Equality. The argument proceeds in three stages. First,\nendorse a non-comparative, high threshold of responsibility for\nliability, such that most noncombatants in most conflicts are not\nresponsible enough to be liable to be killed. This helps explain why\nkilling civilians in war is so hard to justify. Of course, it also\nentails that many combatants will be innocent too. The second step,\nthen, is to defend the principle of Moral Distinction,\naccording to which killing civilians is worse than killing soldiers.\nThis is obviously true if the soldiers are liable and the civilians\nare not. But the challenge is to show that killing non-liable\ncivilians is worse than killing non-liable soldiers. If we\ncan do that, then the permissibility of intentionally killing\nnon-liable soldiers does not entail that intentionally killing\nnon-liable noncombatants is permissible. Of course, one might still\nargue that, even if Moral Distinction is true, we should endorse\npacifism. But, and this is the third stage, the less seriously\nwrongful some act is, the lesser the good that must be realised by\nperforming that act, for it to be all things considered permissible.\nIf intentionally killing innocent combatants is not the worst kind of\nkilling one can do, then the good that must be realised for it to be\nall things considered permissible is less than is the case for, for\nexample, intentionally killing innocent civilians, which philosophers\ntend to think can be permissible only in a supreme emergency. This\ncould mean that intentionally killing innocent soldiers is permissible\neven in the ordinary circumstances of war.\n\nWarfare can be justified, then, by a combination of liability and\nlesser evil grounds. Some unjust combatants lose their rights not to\nbe killed. Others\u2019 rights can be overridden without that\nimplying that unjust noncombatants\u2019 rights may be overridden\ntoo. We can reject the pacifist horn of the responsibility dilemma.\nBut a moderate Combatant Equality is likely to be true: since killing\ninnocent combatants is not the worst kind of killing, it is\ncorrespondingly easier for unjust combatants to justify using lethal\nforce (at least against just combatants). This increases the range of\ncases in which they can satisfy Discrimination, Proportionality, and\nNecessity, and so fight permissibly.\n\nMuch hangs, then, on the arguments for Moral Distinction. Some focus\non why killing innocent noncombatants is especially wrongful; others\non why killing innocent combatants is not so bad. This section\nconsiders the second kind of argument, returning to the first in the\nnext section.\n\nThe revisionists\u2019 arguments mentioned above might not ground\nliability, but do perhaps justify some reason to prefer\nharming combatants. Combatants can better avoid harm than\nnoncombatants. Combatants surely do have somewhat greater\nresponsibilities to bear costs to avert the wrongful actions of their\ncomrades-in-arms than do noncombatants. And the readiness of most\ncombatants to fight\u2014regardless of whether their cause is\njust\u2014likely means that even just combatants have somewhat\nmuddied status relative to noncombatants. They conform to their\nopponents\u2019 rights only by accident. They have weaker grounds for\ncomplaint when they are wrongfully killed than do noncombatants, who\nmore robustly respect the rights of others (on robustness and respect,\nsee Pettit 2015).\n\nAdditionally, when combatants kill other combatants, they typically\nbelieve that they are doing so permissibly. Most often they believe\nthat their cause is just, and that this is a legitimate means to bring\nit about. But, insofar as they are lawful combatants, they will also\nbelieve that international law constrains their actions, so that by\nfighting in accordance with it they are acting permissibly. Lazar\n(2015c) argues that killing people when you know that doing so is\nobjectively wrong is more seriously objectionable than doing so when\nyou reasonably believe that you are acting permissibly.\n\nThe consent-based argument for Combatant Equality fails because of its\nempirical, not its normative premise. If combatants in fact waived\ntheir rights not to be killed by their adversaries, even when fighting\na just war, then that would clearly affect their adversaries\u2019\nreasons for action, reducing the wrongfulness of killing anyone who\nhad waived that right. The problem is that they have not waived their\nrights not to be killed. However, they often do offer a more limited\nimplicit waiver of their rights. The purpose of having armed forces,\nand the intention of many who serve in them, is to protect civilians\nfrom the predations of war. This means both countering threats to and\ndrawing fire away from them. Combatants interpose themselves between\nthe enemy and their civilian compatriots, and fight on their\ncompatriots\u2019 behalf. If they abide by the laws of war, they\nclearly distinguish themselves from the civilian population, wearing a\nuniform and carrying their weapons openly. They implicitly say to\ntheir adversaries: \u201cyou ought to put down your weapons. But if\nyou are going to fight, then fight us\u201d. This\nconstitutes a limited waiver of their rights against harm. Like a full\nwaiver, it alters the reasons confronting their\nadversaries\u2014under these circumstances, other things equal it is\nworse to kill the noncombatants. Of course, in most cases unjust\ncombatants ought simply to stop fighting. But this conditional waiver\nof their opponents\u2019 rights means that, if they are not going to\nput down arms, they do better to target combatants than\nnoncombatants.\n\nOf course, one might think that in virtue of their altruistic\nself-sacrifice, just combatants are actually the least\ndeserving of the harms of war (Tadros 2014). But, first, warfare is\nnot a means for ensuring that people get their just deserts. More\nimportantly, given that their altruism is specifically intended to\ndraw fire away from their compatriot noncombatants, it would be\nperverse to treat this as a reason to do precisely what they are\ntrying to prevent. \n\nThese arguments and others suggest that killing innocent combatants is\nnot the worst kind of killing one can do. It might therefore be all\nthings considered permissible in the ordinary circumstances of war,\nprovided enough good is achieved thereby. If unjust combatants attack\nonly just combatants, and if they achieve some valuable objective by\ndoing so\u2014defence of their comrades, their co-citizens, or their\nterritory\u2014they therefore might fight permissibly, even though\nthey violate the just combatants\u2019 rights (Kamm 2004; Hurka 2005;\nKamm 2005; Steinhoff 2008; Lazar 2013). At least, it is more plausible\nthat they can fight permissibly than if we regarded every just\ncombatant\u2019s death as equivalent to the worst kind of murder.\nThis does not vindicate Combatant Equality\u2014it simply shows that,\nmore often than one might think, unjust combatants can fight\npermissibly. Add to that the fact that all wars are morally\nheterogeneous, involving just and unjust phases (Bazargan 2013), and\nwe quickly see that even if Combatant Equality in the laws of war\nlacks fundamental moral foundations, it is a sensible approximation of\nthe truth.\n\nSome philosophers, however, seek a more robust defence of Combatant\nEquality. The three most prominent lines are institutionalist. A\ncontractualist argument (Benbaji 2008, 2011) starts by observing that\nstates (and their populations) need disciplined armies for the\npurposes of national defence. If soldiers always had to decide for\nthemselves whether a particular war was just, many states could not\nraise armies when they need to. They would be unable to deter\naggression. All states, and all people, benefit from an arrangement\nwhereby individual combatants waive their rights not to be killed by\none another\u2014allowing them to obey their state\u2019s commands\nwithout second-guessing every deployment. Combatants tacitly consent\nto waive their rights in this way, given common knowledge that\nfighting in accordance with the laws of war involves such a waiver.\nMoreover, their assent is \u201cmorally effective\u201d because it\nis consistent with a fair and optimal contract among states.\n\nInternational law does appear to change the moral standing of\ncombatants. If you join the armed forces of a state, you know that, at\ninternational law, you thereby become a legitimate target in armed\nconflict. This has to be relevant to the wrongfulness of harming you,\neven if you are fighting for a just cause. But Benbaji\u2019s\nargument is more ambitious than this. He thinks that soldiers waive\ntheir rights not to be killed by one another\u2014not the limited,\nconditional waiver described above, but an outright waiver, that\nabsolves their adversaries of any wrongdoing (though it does not so\nabsolve their military and political leaders).\n\nThe first problem with this proposal is that it rests on contentious\nempirical speculation about whether soldiers in fact consent in this\nway. But setting that aside, second, it is radically statist, implying\nthat international law simply doesn\u2019t apply to asymmetric\nconflicts between states and non-state actors, since the latter are\nnot part of the appropriate conventions. This gives international law\nshallow foundations, which fail to support the visceral outrage that\nbreaches of international law typically evoke. It also suggests that\nstates that either don\u2019t ratify major articles of international\nlaw, or that withdraw from agreements, can escape its strictures. This\nseems mistaken. Third, we typically regard waivers of fundamental\nrights as reversible when new information comes to light. Why\nshouldn\u2019t just combatants be allowed to withdraw their\nrights-waiver when they are fighting a just war? Many regard the right\nto life as inalienable; even if we deny this, we must surely doubt\nwhether you can alienate it once and for all, under conditions of\ninadequate information. Additionally, suppose that you want to join\nthe armed forces only to fight a specific just war (McMahan 2011b).\nWhy should you waive your rights against harm in this case, given that\nyou plan only to fight now? Fourth, and most seriously, even if\nBenbaji\u2019s argument explained why killing combatants in war is\npermissible regardless of the cause you are serving, it cannot explain\nwhy unintentionally killing noncombatants as a side-effect of\none\u2019s actions is permissible. By joining the armed forces of\ntheir state, soldiers at least do something that implies\ntheir consent to the regime of international law that structures that\nrole. But noncombatants do not consent to this regime. Soldiers\nfighting for unjust causes will inevitably kill many innocent\ncivilians. If those deaths cannot be rendered proportionate, then\nCombatant Equality does not hold.\n\nThe second institutionalist argument starts from the belief that we\nhave a duty to obey the law of our legitimate state. This gives unjust\ncombatants, ordered to fight an unjust war, some reason to obey those\norders. We can ground this in different ways. Estlund (2007) argues\nthat the duty to obey orders derives from the epistemic authority of\nthe state\u2014it is more likely than an individual soldier to know\nwhether this war is just (see Renzo 2013 for criticism); Cheyney Ryan\n(2011) emphasizes the democratic source of the state\u2019s\nauthority, as well as the crucial importance of maintaining civilian\ncontrol of the military. These are genuine moral\nreasons that should weigh in soldiers\u2019 deliberations. But are\nthey really weighty enough to ground Combatant Equality? It seems doubtful.\nThey cannot systematically override unjust combatants\u2019\nobligations not to kill innocent people. This point stands regardless\nof whether these reasons weigh in the balance, or are exclusionary\nreasons that block others from being considered (Raz 1985). The rights\nof innocent people not to be killed are the weightiest, most\nfundamental rights around. For some other reason to outweigh them, or\nexclude them from deliberation, it would have to be extremely\npowerful. Combatants\u2019 obligations to obey orders simply are not\nweighty enough\u2014as everyone recognises with respect to obedience\nto unlawful in bello commands (McMahan 2009: 66ff).\n\nLike the first argument, the third institutionalist argument grounds\nCombatant Equality in its long-term results. But instead of focusing\non states\u2019 ability to defend themselves, it emphasizes the\nimportance of limiting the horrors of war, given that we know that people\ndeceive themselves about the justice of their cause (Shue 2008, 2010;\nDill and Shue 2012; Shue 2013; Waldron 2016). Since combatants and\ntheir leaders almost always believe themselves to be in the right, any\ninjunction to unjust combatants to lay down their arms would simply be\nignored, while any additional permissions to harm noncombatants would\nbe abused by both sides. In almost all wars, it is sufficient\nto achieve military victory that you target only combatants. If doing\nthis will minimize wrongful deaths in the long run, we should enjoin\nthat all sides, regardless of their aims, respect Discrimination.\nAdditionally, while it is extremely difficult to secure international\nagreement even about what in fact constitutes a just cause for war\n(witness the controversy over the Rome statute on crimes of aggression, which took many years of negotiation before diplomats agreed an uneasy compromise), the traditionalist principles\nof jus in bello already have broad international support.\nThey are hard-won concessions that we should abandon only if we are\nsure that the new regime will be an improvement (Roberts 2008).\n\nAlthough this argument is plausible, it doesn\u2019t address the same\nquestion as the act-focused arguments that preceded it. One thing we\ncan ask is: given a particular situation, what ought we to do? How\nought soldiers to act in Afghanistan, or Mali, or Syria, or Somalia?\nAnd when we ask this question, we shouldn\u2019t start by assuming\nthat we or they will obviously fail to comply with any exacting moral\nstandards that we might propose (Lazar 2012a; Lazar and Valentini\nforthcoming). When considering our own actions, and those of people over whom\nwe have influence, we should select from all the available options,\nnot rule some out because we know ourselves to be too immoral to take\nthem. When designing institutions and laws, on the other hand, of\ncourse we should think about how people are likely to respond to them.\nWe need to answer both kinds of questions: what really ought\nI to do? And what should the laws be, given my and others\u2019\npredictable frailty?\n\nA moderate Combatant Equality, then, is the likely consequence of\navoiding the pacifist horn of the responsibility dilemma. To show that\nkilling in war is permissible, we need to show that intentionally\nkilling innocent combatants is not as seriously wrongful as\nintentionally killing innocent noncombatants. And if killing innocent\ncombatants is not the worst kind of killing, it can more plausibly be\njustified by the goods achieved in ordinary wars, outside of supreme\nemergencies. On this view, contrary to the views of both Walzer and\nhis critics, much of the intended killing in justified wars is\npermissible not because the targets are liable to be killed, but\nbecause infringing their rights is a permissible lesser evil. But this\nprinciple applies regardless of whether you are on the just or the\nunjust side. This in turn increases the range of cases in which\ncombatants fighting on the unjust side will be able to fight\npermissibly: instead of needing to achieve some good comparable to\naverting a supreme emergency in order to justify infringing the rights\nof just combatants, they need only achieve more prosaic kinds of\ngoods, since these are not the worst kinds of rights infringements. So\nunjust combatants\u2019 associative duties to protect one another and\ntheir compatriots, their duties to obey their legitimate governments,\nand other such considerations, can sometimes make intentionally\nkilling just combatants a permissible lesser evil, and unintentionally\nkilling noncombatants proportionate. This means that the existing laws\nof war are a closer approximation of combatants\u2019 true moral\nobligations than many revisionists think. Nonetheless, much of the\nkilling done by unjust combatants in war is still objectively\nwrong.\n",
