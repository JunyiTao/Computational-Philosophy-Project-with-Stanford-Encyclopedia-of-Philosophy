    "main_text": "\nIt has become a sinological dogma to\ndistinguish between the so-called Taoist school (Daojia),\nsaid to have produced the classical mystical texts \u2026, and the\nso-called Taoist religion (Daojiao), often said to have begun\nin the Later Han period [i.e., the 1st\u20132nd\ncenturies CE]. The successive\nDaozang [Daoist Canons] never made this distinction. When we\nlook at the way the terms Daojia and Daojiao occur\nin the texts preserved in the Ming Canon [published in 1445], we see\nthat they are practically synonymous and interchangeable. \n \u2014Kristofer Schipper (Schipper and Verellen 2004: 6)\n\n\nThere could be no better introduction to the present article than the\npassage quoted above from one of the main Western scholarly works on\nDaoism (or Taoism), even though it calls into question not only the\nrelevance of this article, but also the actual existence of its subject.\nDaoist texts do not speak of \u201cphilosophy\u201d or\n\u201creligion\u201d, two words that do not even exist in the\npremodern Chinese language. They speak, instead, of what they call the\n\u201chouse\u201d, \u201cfamily\u201d or \u201clineage of the\nDao\u201d (daojia; also translatable in the plural), and of\nwhat they call the \u201cteachings of the Dao\u201d or\n\u201cteachings on the Dao\u201d (daojiao). Daoists, who\nobviously have understood these terms in their literal senses, have\nseen them as defining the same entity: there cannot be\n\u201cteaching\u201d without \u201clineage\u201d, and vice\nversa.\n\nEven if the term \u201creligious Daoism\u201d is accepted, it is not\nclear which entity it should define, and different scholars might explain\nits meaning in different ways. Should \u201creligion\u201d include\nall of Daoism except for its \u201cphilosophy\u201d? This would\nprobably exclude the views of the Daode jing (Book of the Way\nand Its Virtue;\n \u00a71.1\n below), which Daoists have seen as an integral part\u2014in fact, as\nthe source\u2014of their tradition. Omitting these views would be\nsomething like writing a survey of Christianity that intentionally\nneglects to consider the thought and works of the theologians. Should\n\u201creligion\u201d only include communal ritual with the related\npantheons of gods, on the one hand, and the priestly and monastic\ninstitutions, on the other? If so, an article on \u201creligious\nDaoism\u201d would exclude meditation, alchemy, and other individual\npractices that Daoists\u2014including those who did not practice\nthem\u2014have seen as major components of their tradition.\n\nDaoism is a tradition as complex and heterogeneous as Buddhism, Islam,\nJudaism, or Christianity. The modern categories of philosophy and\nreligion can help to comprehend its \u201cotherness\u201d (Seidel\n1997: 39) by interpreting its different manifestations according to a\nsupposedly familiar framework. Yet, the use of these categories can\nalso lead an observer to look only at the aspects of the tradition\nthat fit the chosen framework, and only within the terms of that\nframework. This may result in creating distinctions and boundaries\nthat do not exist within the tradition itself. Even worse, the whole\nissue might simply consist of imposing one cultural model over a\ndifferent one.\n\nThe present article attempts to take into account the Western\nscholarly views on Daoism as well as the Daoists\u2019 views of their\nown tradition. As a consequence, it is based on a broad definition of\nwhat we might call Daoist religion (a term that should replace the more\nwidely-used \u201creligious Daoism\u201d), and also includes views that pertain\nto what we might call Daoist philosophy (or Daoist thought, a term\nmore appropriate than \u201cphilosophical\nDaoism\u201d).\n",
