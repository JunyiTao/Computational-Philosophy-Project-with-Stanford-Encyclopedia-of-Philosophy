One and the same proposition or idea can, as\nBolzano says, appear in the minds of different thinking beings or also\nat different times in the mind of one and the same thinking being,\nwithout thereby being multiplied (WL I, 217, WL III, 13, 112). Bolzano\nsays, in such a case, that the thinking being and its mind\n\u201cgrasp\u201d the proposition or idea in question (the\ncorresponding German word being \u2018erfassen\u2019 or\n\u2018auffassen\u2019). What happens in such a case is that\nin the mind of the thinking being under consideration a mental\nphenomenon occurs, or a mental process takes place in it, that is\ncalled by Bolzano a \u2018Gedanke\u2019\n(\u2018thought\u2019); it can be a subjective idea\nor a subjective proposition, depending on whether an idea or\na proposition \u201cappears\u201d in it.\n\nIn contrast to ideas and propositions (i.e., \u201cobjective\u201d\nideas and \u201cobjective\u201d propositions), subjective ideas and\nsubjective propositions belong to the real world, in particular to\nWorld 2 of mental phenomena and mental processes. For Bolzano, a\nsubjective idea as well as a subjective proposition is a real property\n(or \u201cadherence\u201d) of the thinking being in whose mind it\nappears, or rather of this being\u2019s mind or \u201csoul\u201d\nitself (WL III, 6, 10 f., 109). A subjective idea is a mental\nphenomenon \u2014 i.e., an attribute of a mind \u2014 that\n\u201cgrasps\u201d an idea (in the \u201cobjective\u201d sense of\nthe word); and a mental phenomenon that \u201cgrasps\u201d a\nproposition is called \u2018Urteil\u2019\n(\u2018judgment\u2019) by Bolzano (WL III, 108). In\naddition to judgments, there is a second kind of subjective\npropositions, viz. propositions that are \u201cmerely thought\u201d\n(blo\u00df gedacht); a \u201cmerely thought\nproposition\u201d is in fact a subjective idea of a proposition, i.e.\na mental phenomenon which grasps an idea whose object is a proposition\n(WL I, 155). Merely having a subjective idea of a proposition does not\nrequire that we assert the truth of the proposition in question,\nwhereas a judgment is an act (Handlung) of asserting the\ntruth of the proposition grasped by the judgment (WL III, 108,\n199).\n\nWhen we say of a subjective idea or a judgment that it\n\u201cgrasps\u201d an idea or proposition, respectively, the word\n\u2018grasp\u2019 is used in a more restrictive sense than before,\nwhere it was a thinking being or its mind of which it was said that it\n\u201cgrasps\u201d an idea or proposition. This stricter relation of\n\u201cgrasping\u201d, holding between subjective ideas and ideas,\nand between judgments and propositions is fundamental for\nBolzano\u2019s epistemology. Instead of saying in this sense\n\u2018\\(p\\) grasps \\(o\\)\u2019, Bolzano will synonymously also use\nthe phrase \u2018\\(o\\) is the \u201cmaterial\u201d (Stoff)\nof \\(p\\)\u2019. Both formulations, however, are \u2014 as Bolzano\nemphasizes \u2014 to be understood merely metaphorically (Bolzano\n1935, 84 f.). The corresponding relation is introduced as a primitive\nconcept in Bolzano\u2019s epistemology. Let us use the symbol\n\u2018\\(\\mathbf{G}\\)\u2019 for this relation, whereby \u2018\\(p\n\\mathbf{G} o\\)\u2019 is to be read as \u2018\\(p\\) grasps\n\\(o\\)\u2019 or, alternatively, \u2018\\(o\\) is the\n\u201cmaterial\u201d of \\(p\\)\u2019.\n\nIn terms of \u2018\\(\\mathbf{G}\\)\u2019, i.e., the strict relation of\n\u201cgrasping\u201d, the weaker relation of \u201cgrasping\u201d\nbetween a thinking being and an idea or proposition can be defined as\nfollows: a thinking being \\(x\\) \u201cgrasps\u201d (in the weaker\nsense of this word) an idea or proposition \\(o\\) iff there is a\nsubjective idea or a judgment \\(p\\) in \\(x\\)\u2019s mind such that\n\\(p \\mathbf{G} o\\). The relation \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) is the link between\nthe mental phenomena of World 2 on the one hand and the World 3 of\nideas and propositions on the other hand. Via relation \\(\\mathbf{G}\\),\nitems of World 3 can have a certain, non-causal influence on the\nmental phenomena of World 2, and these on their part stand in causal\nrelations to other mental phenomena and also to the physical phenomena\nof World 1.\n\nDue to the domain and the range of \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) being disjunctive\nsets, the relation \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) has the following formal features:\nit is irreflexive, asymmetric, and (trivially) transitive; moreover,\n\\(\\mathbf{G}\\) is many-one, but not one-many. Due to\n\\(\\mathbf{G}\\)\u2019s being many-one, by each subjective idea and\neach judgment an idea or a proposition, respectively, is uniquely\ndetermined as its material (WL III, 8 f., 108). Most of the important\nproperties, relations and distinctions, which were defined by Bolzano\nprimarily for ideas and propositions, can therefore easily be\ntransferred from the sphere of ideas and propositions to the sphere of\nsubjective ideas and judgments. We therefore will say of a subjective\nidea that it is simple or complex, empty, singular or general, an\nintuition, a concept or \u201cmixed\u201d according as the idea\ngrasped by it has the corresponding property; and the same goes for\njudgments.\u00a0\n",
