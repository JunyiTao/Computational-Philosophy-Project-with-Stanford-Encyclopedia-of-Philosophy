    "main_text": "Specific Moral Challenges at the Cultural Level || Malware, Spyware and Informational Warfare\n3.3 Malware, Spyware and Informational Warfare\n\nMalware and computer virus threats continue to grow at an astonishing\nrate. Security industry professionals report that while certain types\nof malware attacks such as spam are falling out of fashion, newer\ntypes of attacks such as Ransomware and other methods focused on\nmobile computing devices, cryptocurrency, and the hacking of cloud\ncomputing infrastructure are on the rise outstripping any small relief\nseen in the slowing down of older forms of attack (Cisco Systems\n2018; Kaspersky Lab 2017, McAfee 2018, Symantec 2018). What is clear is\nthat this type of activity will be with us for the foreseeable\nfuture. In addition to the largely criminal activity of malware\nproduction, we must also consider the related but more morally\nambiguous activities of hacking, hacktivism, commercial spyware, and\ninformational warfare. Each of these topics has its own suite of\nsubtle moral ambiguities. We will now explore some of them here. \n\nWhile there may be wide agreement that the conscious spreading of\nmalware is of questionable morality there is an interesting question\nas to the morality of malware protection and anti-virus software. With\nthe rise in malicious software there has been a corresponding growth\nin the security industry which is now a multibillion dollar market.\nEven with all the money spent on security software there seems to be\nno slowdown in virus production, in fact quite the opposite has\noccurred. This raises an interesting business ethics concern; what\nvalue are customers receiving for their money from the security\nindustry? The massive proliferation of malware has been shown to be\nlargely beyond the ability of anti-virus software to completely\nmitigate. There is an important lag in the time between when a new\npiece of malware is detected by the security community and the\neventual release of the security patch and malware removal tools.\n\n\nThe anti-virus modus operandi of receiving a sample, analyzing the\nsample, adding detection for the sample, performing quality assurance,\ncreating an update, and finally sending the update to their users\nleaves a huge window of opportunity for the adversary \u2026 even\nassuming that anti-virus users update regularly. (Aycock and Sullins\n2010)\n This lag is constantly exploited by malware producers\nand in this model there is an ever-present security hole that is\nimpossible to fill. Thus it is important that security professionals\ndo not overstate their ability to protect systems, by the time a new\nmalicious program is discovered and patched, it has already done\nsignificant damage and there is currently no way to stop this (Aycock\nand Sullins 2010).\n\n\nIn the past most malware creation was motivated by hobbyists and\namateurs, but this has changed and now much of this activity is\ncriminal in nature (Cisco Systems 2018; Kaspersky Lab 2017, McAfee\n2018, Symantec 2018). Aycock and Sullins (2010) argue that relying on\na strong defense is not enough and the situation requires a\ncounteroffensive reply as well and they propose an ethically motivated\nmalware research and creation program. This is not an entirely new\nidea and it was originally suggested by the Computer Scientist George\nLedin in his editorial for the Communications of the ACM,\n\u201cNot Teaching Viruses and Worms is Harmful\u201d (2005). This\nidea does run counter to the majority opinion regarding the ethics of\nlearning and deploying malware. Many computer scientists and\nresearchers in information ethics agree that all malware is unethical\n(Edgar 2003; Himma 2007a; Neumann 2004; Spafford 1992; Spinello\n2001). According to Aycock and Sullins, these worries can be mitigated\nby open research into understanding how malware is created in order to\nbetter fight this threat (2010).\n\nWhen malware and spyware is created by state actors, we enter the\nworld of informational warfare and a new set of moral concerns. Every\ndeveloped country in the world experiences daily cyber-attacks, with\nthe major target being the United States that experiences a purported\n1.8 billion attacks a month in 2010 (Lovely 2010) and 80 billion\nmalicious scans world wide in 2017 (McAfee 2018). The majority of\nthese attacks seem to be just probing for weaknesses but they can\ndevastate a countries internet such as the cyber-attacks on Estonia in\n2007 and those in Georgia which occurred in 2008. While the Estonian\nand Georgian attacks were largely designed to obfuscate communication\nwithin the target countries more recently informational warfare has\nbeen used to facilitate remote sabotage. The famous Stuxnet virus used\nto attack Iranian nuclear centrifuges is perhaps the first example of\nweaponized software capable of creating remotely damaging physical\nfacilities (Cisco Systems 2018). The coming decades will likely see\nmany more cyber weapons deployed by state actors along well-known\npolitical fault lines such as those between Israel-America-western\nEurope vs Iran, and America-Western Europe vs China (Kaspersky Lab\n2018). The moral challenge here is to determine when these attacks are\nconsidered a severe enough challenge to the sovereignty of a nation to\njustify military reactions and to react in a justified and ethical\nmanner to them (Arquilla 2010; Denning 2008, Kaspersky Lab 2018).\n\nThe primary moral challenge of informational warfare is determining\nhow to use weaponized information technologies in a way that honors\nour commitments to just and legal warfare. Since warfare is already a\nmorally questionable endeavor it would be preferable if information\ntechnologies could be leveraged to lessen violent combat. For\ninstance, one might argue that the Stuxnet virus used undetected from\n2005 to 2010 did damage to Iranian nuclear weapons programs that in\ngenerations before might have only been accomplished by an air raid or\nother kinetic military action that would have incurred significant\ncivilian casualties\u2014and that so far there have been no reported\nhuman casualties resulting from Stuxnet. Thus malware might lessen the\namount of civilian casualties in conflict. The malware known as\n\u201cFlame\u201d is an interesting case of malware that evidence\nsuggests was designed to aid in espionage.  One might argue that more\naccurate information given to decision makers during wartime should\nhelp them make better decisions on the battlefield. On the other hand,\nthese new informational warfare capabilities might allow states to\nengage in continual low level conflict eschewing efforts for\npeacemaking which might require political compromise.\n",
