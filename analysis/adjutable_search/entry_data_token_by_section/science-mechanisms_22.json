    "main_text": "Relations between Scientific Disciplines: From Theory Reduction to Mechanism Integration || Philosophical Work to Be Done\n5.3 Philosophical Work to Be Done\nThe Nagel model of theory reduction offers a clear vision of the\n\u201cunity of science\u201d\n(see the entry on unity of science).\nAccording to the model, the unity among scientific disciplines is\nachieved by reducing theories of higher-level disciplines to the\ntheories of lower-level disciplines. Integration, on that vision, is\nunderstood as progress toward a grand, unified body of scientific\nknowledge. For mechanists, in contrast, integration is piecemeal,\nlocal, and pluralistic. What sort of unity could such an\n\u201cintegration\u201d sustain? This question plays out in a\nback-and-forth between Longino and Tabery concerning disciplinary\nrelationships in the behavioral sciences. Tabery argues that\ndisciplines as disparate as neurobiology and quantitative genetics\ncould pluralistically co-exist and co-inform one another\u2019s causal\nexplanations of complex behaviors by way of mechanism integration.\nLongino counters that Tabery\u2019s pluralism is only a\n\u201cmoderate\u201d sort because the push for integration\nultimately is a push for unification (Longino 2013, 2014; Tabery\n2014a,b).  Sullivan (2009) also challenges the push for mechanism\nintegration; she argues that there are significant barriers to the\nkind of integration mechanists envision. Different laboratories use\ndifferent experimental protocols to study what they assume to be the\nsame phenomenon; however, these different protocols often in fact\ntarget different phenomena, so the integration achieved by combining\nresults is only illusory. These discussions are symptomatic of more\ngeneral philosophical questions faced by mechanists: How are mechanism\nintegrations actually achieved (as opposed to just asserted)? And what\nis the relationship between mechanism integration and unification? The\nnew mechanical philosophy stands to benefit from future efforts to\nsituate mechanistic integration into more general philosophical views\nof integration and pluralism.\n",
