    "main_text": "Critical Methods || Reconstructive Critique\n2.3 Reconstructive Critique\n\nThose who subscribe to the model of reconstructive critique\nemphasize the downsides of uncoupling normative argument from social\nanalysis and social theory. In Axel Honneth\u2019s work, this shift\ntakes two forms. In his earlier work (1992), he argues that the\nrelatively narrow rationalist focus on communicative reason occludes\nmore fundamental and often prelinguistic experiences and\nintersubjective relations that give rise to struggles for recognition\nand that his Hegel-inspired theory is better able to articulate, thus\nreestablishing the link between theory and social reality in more\nsubstantial ways. Relatedly, Honneth insists that critical theory can\nbe distinguished from other normative enterprises by its reference to\n\u201cthe pretheoretical resource in which its own critical viewpoint\nis anchored extra-theoretically as an empirical interest or moral\nexperience\u201d (Honneth 1994 [2007, 63\u201364]).\n\nExpanding on this earlier commitment, in his later work Honneth argues\nagainst the division of theoretical labor in which (constructivist)\nphilosophy engages in normative theorizing while empirical sociology\ninvestigates our social reality (2011). By contrast, he undertakes a\n\u201cnormative reconstruction\u201d of how modern society \u2013\nits legal, moral, political as well as social and economic practices\nand institutions \u2013 came to be centered around individual freedom\nas the highest value of this cultural formation. Honneth wants to show\nthat we can only gain an adequate theoretical understanding of, and\ncritical perspective on, modern society if we analyze its different\nsocial spheres as attempts to institutionalize the value of freedom.\nIn contrast to both revolutionary and conservative approaches, he\nwants to show that the structure of this institutionalization allows\nfor a progressive realization of the value of freedom as social actors\nappeal to the constitutive idea of freedom to challenge the concrete\nforms of unfreedom that remain characteristic of our social\nreality.\n\nSimilar to Honneth methodologically, Rahel Jaeggi argues, in her\nreconstructive approach to the critique of forms of life, that\nbracketing the question of how to rationally evaluate and criticize\nforms of life as a whole, as Rawlsians do in the name of liberal\nneutrality and Habermasians in the name of \u201cethical\nabstinence,\u201d ends up hindering precisely the kind of\nexperimental learning processes that are crucial for forms of life to\nremain dynamic and avoid stagnation and failure (2014 [2018,\n9\u201324, 318\u2013319]). But Jaeggi places a greater emphasis on\ncontradictions, crises, and conflicts than the later Honneth (see also\nSchaub 2015).\n\nThe approaches of both Honneth and Jaeggi exemplify a conception of\nimmanent critique that closely links analysis and critique, issuing in\na critique that is neither a mere description of what exists nor a\nnormative demand imposed on what exists from the outside. Accordingly,\nit does not proceed in a free-standing, normative way, but relies on a\nspecific combination of philosophical reflection and\nsocial-theoretical as well as empirical research that is grounded in\nsocial developments and crises and actual social experiences and\nself-understandings. This methodological reorientation has also led to\na more substantial engagement with questions of the economy and the\nsphere of work, both from a more Durkheim-inspired (Honneth 2022,\n2023, Celikates, Honneth, and Jaeggi 2023) and a more Marx-inspired\n(Fraser 2022) position that has also resulted in a fundamental\n(non-reformist) critique of capitalism (Fraser and Jaeggi 2018).\n",
