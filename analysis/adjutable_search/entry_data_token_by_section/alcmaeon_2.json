    "main_text": "Life and Works || Date\n1.3 Date\n\nNo issue concerning Alcmaeon has been more controversial than his\ndate. Some have sought to date him on the basis of his address to\nBrotinus (e.g., Zhmud 2012a, 122). Brotinus\u2019 dates are too\nuncertain to be of much help, however. If he is Theano\u2019s father\nand Theano was Pythagoras\u2019 wife, he could be a contemporary of\nPythagoras (570\u2013490) or even older. If he is Theano\u2019s\nhusband and she was a student of Pythagoras in his old age and thus\ntwenty in 490, Brotinus could have been born as late as 520. This\nsuggests that Brotinus could have been the addressee of the book any\ntime between 550 and 450 BCE. The center of controversy, however, has\nbeen a sentence in the passage of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics discussed above:\n\nAlcmaeon of Croton also seems to have thought along similar lines, and\neither he took this theory over from them [i.e. the Pythagoreans] or\nthey from him. For in age Alcmaeon was in the old age of\nPythagoras, and his views were similar to theirs\n(986a27\u201331).\n\n\nThe sentence in bold above is missing in one of the major manuscripts\nand Alexander makes no mention of it in his commentary on the\nMetaphysics. It does appear in the other two major\nmanuscripts and in Asclepius\u2019 commentary. A number of scholars\nhave regarded it as a remark by a later commentator, which has crept\ninto the text (e.g., Ross 1924, 152; Burkert 1972, 29, n.60) and this\nis the view of the most recent editor (Primavesi 2012, 447\u20138).\nIt is a surprising remark for Aristotle to make, since he only refers\nto Pythagoras once elsewhere in all his extant writings and throughout\nthis passage of the Metaphysics refers to the Pythagoreans or\nItalians in the plural. Other scholars regard the remark as genuine\n(e.g., Wachtler 1896; Guthrie 1962, 341\u20133; Zhmud 2012a, 122).\nEven if we accept the remark as genuine, the assertion that Alcmaeon\n\u201cwas\u201d (egeneto) in the old age of Pythagoras is\nambiguous. Does it mean that Alcmaeon was born in the old age of\nPythagoras, or that he lived (flourished?) in the old age of\nPythagoras? Diels emended the sentence to say that Alcmaeon was\n\u201cyoung\u201d in the old age of Pythagoras and this emendation\nis supported by a similar remark found in Iamblichus (VP\n104). Although Diels accepted the text as Aristotelian, others have\nseen the parallel with Iamblichus as evidence that it is a remark by a\nlater commentator and have pointed out that the report in Iamblichus\ninvolves several chronological impossibilities (e.g., that Philolaus\nwas young in the old age of Pythagoras). Moreover, Diels\u2019 text\nsuggests that the purpose of the remark was to show Alcmaeon\u2019s\ndependence on Pythagoras, which would show that the remark cannot be\ndue to Aristotle, who has just distinguished Alcmaeon from the\nPythagoreans and expressed doubts as to who influenced whom (Primavesi\n2012, 447\u20138). Even if the remark is unlikely to go back to\nAristotle, his doubts about who influenced whom suggest that Alcmaeon\nbelonged to the late sixth or early fifth century (Schofield 2012,\n156), which would argue against the late date of 440 adopted by\nMansfeld (2013, 78, n. 1). One group of scholars thus dates the\npublication of Alcmaeon\u2019s book to around 500 (Burkert 1972, 292;\nKirk, Raven, Schofield 1983, 339 [early 5th]; Zhmud 2012a,\n122 [not later than 490]) so that he would have been born around 540.\nAnother group has him born around 510 so that his book would have been\npublished in 470 or later (Guthrie 1962, 358 [480\u2013440 BCE];\nLloyd 1991, 168 [490\u2013430 BCE]). In either case Alcmaeon probably\nwrote before Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Philolaus. He is either the\ncontemporary or the predecessor of Parmenides. Attempts to date him on\nthe basis of internal evidence alone, i.e. comparison of his doctrines\nwith those of other thinkers, have led to the widest divergence of\ndates. Edelstein says that he may have lived in the late fifth century\n(1942, 372), while Lebedev makes him active in the late 6th\n(1993).\n",
