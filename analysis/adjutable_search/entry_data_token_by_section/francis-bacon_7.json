Science and Social Philosophy\n\n\nIn Bacon's thought we encounter a relation between science and\nsocial philosophy, since his ideas concerning a utopian transformation\nof society presuppose an integration into the social framework of his\nprogram concerning natural philosophy and technology as the two forms\nof the maker's knowledge. From his point of view, which was\ninfluenced by Puritan conceptions, early modern society has to make\nsure that losses caused by the Fall are compensated for, primarily by\nman's enlargement of knowledge, providing the preconditions for a\nnew form of society which combines scientia nova and\nthe millennium, according to the prophecy of Daniel 12:4 (Hill 1971,\n85\u2013130). Science as a social endeavor is seen as a collective\nproject for the improvement of social structures. On the other hand, a\nstrong collective spirit in society may function as a conditio sine\nqua non for reforming natural philosophy. Bacon's famous\nargument that it is wise not to confound the Book of Nature with the\nBook of God comes into focus, since the latter deals with God's\nwill (inscrutable for man) and the former with God's work, the\nscientific explanation or appreciation of which is a form of Christian\ndivine service. Successful operations in natural philosophy and\ntechnology help to improve the human lot in a way which makes the\nhardships of life after the Fall obsolete. It is important to note that\nBacon's idea of a\u2014to a certain extent\u2014Christian\nsociety by no means conveys Christian pessimism in the vein of\npatristic thinkers but rather displays a clear optimism as the result\nof compounding the problem of truth with the scope of human freedom and\nsovereignty (Brandt 1979, 21).\n\n\nWith regard to Bacon's Two Books\u2014the Book of God and\nthe Book of Nature\u2014one has to keep in mind that man, when given\nfree access to the Book of Nature, should not content himself with\nmerely reading it. He also has to find out the names by which things\nare called. If man does so, not only will he be restored to his status\na noble and powerful being, but the Book of God will also lose\nimportance, from a traditional point of view, in comparison to the Book\nof Nature. This is what Blumenberg referred to as the \u201casymmetry\nof readability\u201d (Blumenberg 1981, 86\u2013107). But the process\nof reading is an open-ended activity, so that new knowledge and the\nexpansion of the system of disciplines can no longer be restricted by\nconcepts such as the completeness and eternity of knowledge (Klein\n2004a, 73).\n\n\nAccording to Bacon, the Book of God refers to his will, the Book of\nNature to his works. He never gives a hint in his works that he has\nconcealed any message of unbelief for the sophisticated reader; but he\nemphasized: (1) that religion and science should be kept separate\nand,  (2) that they were nevertheless complementary to each other.\nFor Bacon, the attack of theologians on human curiosity cannot be\nfounded on a rational basis. His statement that \u201call knowledge is\nto be limited by religion, and to be referred to use and action\u201d\n(Bacon III [1887], 218)  does not express a general verdict on\ntheoretical curiosity, but instead provides a normative framework for\nthe tasks of science in a universal sense. Already in the dedicatory\nletter to James I in his Advancement of Learning, Bacon\nattacks \u201cthe zeal and jealousy of divines\u201d (Bacon III, \n264) and in his manuscript Filum Labyrinthi of 1607, he\n\u201cthought  \u2026 how great opposition and prejudice\nnatural philosophy had received by superstition, and the immoderate and\nblind zeal of religion\u201d (Bacon VI [1863], 421). As Calvin\nhad done long before him in the Institutes, Bacon stated that\nsince God created the physical world, it was a legitimate object of\nman's knowledge, a conviction which he illustrated with the\nfamous example of King Solomon in The Advancement of Learning\n(Zagorin 1999, 49\u201350; see also Kocher 1953,\n27\u20138). Bacon praises Solomon's wisdom, which seems to\nbe more like a game than an example of man's God-given thirst for\nknowledge: \n\nThe glory  of God is to conceal a thing, but the\nglory of the king is to find it out; as if, according to the innocent\nplay of children, the Divine Majesty took delight to hide his works, to\nthe end to have them found out; and as if kings could not obtain a\ngreater honour than to be God's playfellows in that game,\nconsidering the great commandment of wits and means, whereby nothing\nneedeth to be hidden from them. (Bacon III [1887], 299;\nBlumenberg, 1973, 196\u2013200)\n\nFrom this perspective, the punishment of mankind on account of the\nvery first disobedience by Adam and Eve can be seen in a different\nlight from that of theological interpretations. In Bacon's view, this\ndisobedience and its consequences can be remedied in two ways: (1) by\nreligion and moral imperatives, and (2) by advancement in the arts and\nsciences: \u201cthe purpose in advancing arts and sciences is the\nglory of God and the relief of man's estate\u201d (Wormald 1993,\n82).\n\n\nThe two remedies, which are interconnected with the moral dimension,\nrefer to the advancement of learning and religion. All three together\n(the advancement of learning, religion, and morality) are combined in\nsuch a way that they promote each other mutually; consequently, limited\noutlooks on coping with life and knowledge are ruled out completely in\nthese three fields.\n",
