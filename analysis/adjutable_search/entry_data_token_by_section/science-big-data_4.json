Big Data and Evidence\n\nOne thing that the representational and relational views agree on is\nthe key epistemic role of data as empirical evidence for knowledge\nclaims or interventions. While there is a large philosophical\nliterature on the nature of evidence (e.g., Achinstein 2001; Reiss\n2015; Kelly 2016), however, the relation between data and evidence has\nreceived less attention. This is arguably due to an implicit\nacceptance, by many philosophers, of the representational view of\ndata. Within the representational view, the identification of what\ncounts as data is prior to the study of what those data can be\nevidence for: in other words, data are \u201cgivens\u201d, as the\netymology of the word indicates, and inferential methods are\nresponsible for determining whether and how the data available to\ninvestigators can be used as evidence, and for what. The focus of\nphilosophical attention is thus on formal methods to single out errors\nand misleading interpretations, and the probabilistic and/or\nexplanatory relation between what is unproblematically taken to be a\nbody of evidence and a given hypothesis. Hence much of the expansive\nphilosophical work on evidence avoids the term \u201cdata\u201d\naltogether. Peter Achinstein\u2019s seminal work is a case in point:\nit discusses observed facts and experimental results, and whether and\nunder which conditions scientists would have reasons to believe such\nfacts, but it makes no mention of data and related processing\npractices (Achinstein 2001).\n\nBy contrast, within the relational view an object can only be\nidentified as datum when it is viewed as having value as evidence.\nEvidence becomes a category of data identification, rather than a\ncategory of data use as in the representational view (Canali 2019). Evidence is thus constitutive of the very notion of data\nand cannot be disentangled from it. This involves accepting that the\nconditions under which a given object can serve as evidence\u2014and\nthus be viewed as datum - may change; and that should this evidential\nrole stop altogether, the object would revert back into an ordinary,\nnon-datum item. For example, the photograph of a plant taken by a\ntourist in a remote region may become relevant as evidence for an\ninquiry into the morphology of plants from that particular locality;\nyet most photographs of plants are never considered as evidence for an\ninquiry into the features and functioning of the world, and of those\nwho are, many may subsequently be discarded as uninteresting or no\nlonger pertinent to the questions being asked.\n\nThis view accounts for the mobility and repurposing that characterises\nbig data use, and for the possibility that objects that were not\noriginally generated in order to serve as evidence may be subsequently\nadopted as such. Consider Mayo and Spanos\u2019s \u201cminimal\nscientific principle for evidence\u201d, which they define as\nfollows: \n\n\nData x0 provide poor evidence for H if they\nresult from a method or procedure that has little or no ability of\nfinding flaws in\nH, even if H is false. (Mayo & Spanos 2009b) \n\n\nThis principle is compatible with the relational view of data since it\nincorporates cases where the methods used to generate and process data\nmay not have been geared towards the testing of a hypothesis H: all it\nasks is that such methods can be made relevant to the testing of H, at\nthe point in which data are used as evidence for H (I shall come back\nto the role of hypotheses in the handling of evidence in the next\nsection).\n\nThe relational view also highlights the relevance of practices of data\nformatting and manipulation to the treatment of data as evidence, thus\ntaking attention away from the characteristics of the data objects\nalone and focusing instead on the agency attached to and enabled by\nthose characteristics. Nora Boyd has provided a way to conceptualise\ndata processing as an integral part of inferential processes, and thus\nof how we should understand evidence. To this aim she introduced the\nnotion of \u201cline of evidence\u201d, which she defines as: \n\n\na sequence of empirical results including the records of data\ncollection and all subsequent products of data processing generated on\nthe way to some final empirical constraint. (Boyd 2018:406) \n\n\nShe thus proposes a conception of evidence that embraces both data and\nthe way in which data are handled, and indeed emphasises the\nimportance of auxiliary information used when assessing data for\ninterpretation, which includes \n\n\nthe metadata regarding the provenance of the data records and the\nprocessing workflow that transforms them. (2018: 407) \n\n\nAs she concludes, \n\n\ntogether, a line of evidence and its associated metadata compose what\nI am calling an \u201cenriched line of evidence\u201d. The\nevidential corpus is then to be made up of many such enriched lines of\nevidence. (2018: 407)\n\n\nThe relational view thus fosters a functional and contextualist\napproach to evidence as the manner through which one or more objects\nare used as warrant for particular knowledge items (which can be\npropositional claims, but also actions such as specific decisions or\nmodes of conduct/ways of operating). This chimes with the contextual\nview of evidence defended by Reiss (2015), John Norton\u2019s work on\nthe multiple, tangled lines of inferential reasoning underpinning\nappeals to induction (2003), and Hasok Chang\u2019s emphasis on the\nepistemic activities required to ground evidential claims (2012).\nBuilding on these ideas and on Stephen Toulmin\u2019s seminal work on\nresearch schemas (1958),\nAlison Wylie has gone one step further in evaluating the inferential\nscaffolding that researchers (and particularly archaeologists, who so\noften are called to re-evaluate the same data as evidence for new\nclaims; Wylie 2017) need to make sense of their data, interpret them\nin ways that are robust to potential challenges, and modify\ninterpretations in the face of new findings. This analysis enabled\nWylie to formulate a set of conditions for robust evidential\nreasoning, which include epistemic security in the chain of evidence,\ncausal anchoring and causal independence of the data used as evidence,\nas well as the explicit articulation of the grounds for calibration of\nthe instruments and methods involved (Chapman & Wylie 2016; Wylie\nforthcoming). A similar conclusion is reached by Jessey Wright\u2019s\nevaluation of the diverse data analysis techniques that\nneuroscientists use to make sense of functional magnetic resonance\nimaging of the brain (fMRI scans): \n\n\ndifferent data analysis techniques reveal different patterns in the\ndata. Through the use of multiple data analysis techniques,\nresearchers can produce results that are locally robust. (Wright 2017:\n1179) \n\n\nWylie\u2019s and Wright\u2019s analyses exemplify how a relational\napproach to data fosters a normative understanding of \u201cgood\nevidence\u201d which is anchored in situated judgement\u2014the\narguably human prerogative to contextualise and assess the\nsignificance of evidential claims. The advantages of this view of\nevidence are eloquently expressed by Nancy Cartwright\u2019s critique\nof both philosophical theories and policy approaches that do not\nrecognise the local and contextual nature of evidential reasoning. As\nshe notes, \n\n\nwe need a concept that can give guidance about what is relevant to\nconsider in deciding on the probability of the hypothesis, not one\nthat requires that we already know significant facts about the\nprobability of the hypothesis on various pieces of evidence.\n(Cartwright 2013: 6) \n\n\nThus she argues for a notion of evidence that is not too restrictive,\ntakes account of the difficulties in combining and selecting evidence,\nand allows for contextual judgement on what types of evidence are best\nsuited to the inquiry at hand (Cartwright 2013, 2019). Reiss\u2019s\nproposal of a pragmatic theory of evidence similarly aims to \n\n\ntakes scientific practice [..] seriously, both in terms of its greater\nuse of knowledge about the conditions under which science is practised\nand in terms of its goal to develop insights that are relevant to\npractising scientists. (Reiss 2015: 361)\n\n\nA better characterisation of the relation between data and evidence,\npredicated on the study of how data are processed and aggregated, may\ngo a long way towards addressing these demands. As aptly argued by\nJames Woodward, the evidential relationship between data and claims is\nnot a \u201ca purely formal, logical, or a priori matter\u201d\n(Woodward 2000: S172\u2013173). This again sits uneasily with the expectation that\nbig data analysis may automate scientific discovery and make human\njudgement redundant.\n",
