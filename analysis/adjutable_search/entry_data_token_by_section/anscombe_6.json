    "main_text": "Testimony\n7. Conclusion\n\nG. E. M. Anscombe\u2019s work ranged over many years and many\ndifferent areas in philosophy. The breadth of her work is impressive.\nShe was systematic in her thinking, seeing and developing connections\nbetween metaphysics, moral psychology, and ethics that exhibited not\nsimply a grasp of one particular problem, but a world view. Much of\nher works remains unpublished, although newly accessible through the\nAnscombe Papers Project at the Collegium Institute for Catholic\nThought & Culture. Anscombe\u2019s legacy is one of the broadest\nand deepest left by a 20th century philosopher.\n",
