    "main_text": "A glance at present-day investigations || From paradoxes to theorems\n6.1 From paradoxes to theorems\n\nAs noticed many years ago by Kreisel and quite aptly recalled by Dean\n2020, p. 541, the right question to deal with is not how to get\nrid of paradoxes or to solve them: instead, the fruitful\nproblem is to get something out of them. Indeed, paradoxes\ncan be converted into plain undecidability/undefinability theorems,\nand this is the consequence of a systematic methodology: with the work\nof G\u00f6del and Tarski, paradoxical arguments are reshaped into\nfixed point results, while the semantic conception of truth gives rise\nto a formalization of semantics itself, yielding firm grounds\nfor systematic metamathematical investigations, as can be seen from\nseveral early contributions by a number of logicians, e.g. Kreisel\n1950, Wang 1955. For instance, arithmetizing semantics yields a\nrefinement of the completeness theorem, the so-called arithmetized\ncompleteness theorem ART: every recursive consistent theory has a\nmodel in which the function symbols are replaced by primitive\nrecursive functions and the predicate symbols are replaced by\npredicates which are definable with just 2 quantifiers in a\nversion of formal number theory (cf. Hilbert and Bernays 1939, p. 293\nand Feferman 1960). By adding an arithmetic sentence Con(S) expressing\nthe consistency of a set theory S as a new axiom to\nelementary number theory, one can prove in the resulting system\narithmetic translations of all theorems of S. A by-product of\nthis metamathematical formalization is a de facto unification\nof set theoretic and semantic theoretic paradoxes, in the sense that\nparadoxes of either sort become tools for proving incompleteness and\nundecidability. Typically, a given paradoxical notion is formalized as\na predicate in a language of a theory interpreting (at least a\nfragment of) number theory Z; one then applies diagonalization,\nself-reference, etc., in order to get statements which correspond to\nnumber theoretic sentences that becomes undecidable or unprovable\ngiven a consistency assumption.\n",
