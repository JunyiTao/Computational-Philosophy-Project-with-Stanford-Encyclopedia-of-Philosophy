One has\nthe same consciousness of self no matter what else one is conscious of\n\u2014 thinking, perceiving, laughing, being miserable, or whatever.\nKant expressed the thought this way,\nthrough the \u2018I\u2019, as simple representation,\nnothing manifold is given. [B135]\n\n\nAnd this,\nthe I that I think is distinct from the I that it \u2026\nintuits \u2026; I am given to myself beyond that which is given in\nintuition. [B155]\n\n\nWe now have the fifth thesis to be found in Kant:\n\nWhen one is conscious of oneself as subject, one has a bare\nconsciousness of self in which \u201cnothing manifold is\ngiven.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince, on Kant\u2019s view, one can refer to oneself as oneself without knowing any properties of oneself, not just identifying properties, \u2018non-ascriptive reference to self\u2019 might capture what is special about this form of consciousness of self better than Shoemaker\u2019s \u2018self-reference\nwithout identification\u2019.\n",
