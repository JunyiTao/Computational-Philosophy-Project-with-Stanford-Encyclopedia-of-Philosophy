    "main_text": "Quaker feminism || Arguments against women\u2019s preaching\n3.1 Arguments against women\u2019s preaching\n\n\nCritics of women\u2019s preaching typically appealed to the natural\ninferiority of the female sex, the biblical tale of Eve\u2019s\ntransgression, and Pauline injunctions against women speaking in\nchurch. In the anonymous A Spirit moving in the Women\nPreachers (1646), the author asserts that women preachers\ntransgress not only the rules of nature but also of modesty, divinity,\ndiscretion, and civility. On these grounds, the author concludes that\nwomen preachers cannot possibly be moved by the spirit of God but must\npartake in the spirit of darkness, ignorance, and gross error. To\nsupport his point, the author notes that the Serpent approached Eve\nfirst, because he knew that women were \u201cthe silly and weaker\nSex\u201d and \u201cnaturally apt unto all mischiefe\u201d\n(Anonymous 1646, 2). In his Antichrist in Man (1655), Joshuah\nMiller explicitly takes issue with the Quaker practice of permitting\nwomen to speak in church by citing two New Testament passages that\nseemingly forbid women\u2019s spiritual leadership: 1 Corinthians\n14:34, \u201cLet your women keep silence in the churches: for it is\nnot permitted unto them to speak\u201d, and 1 Timothy 2:11\u201312,\n\u201cLet the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer\nnot a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in\nsilence\u201d. He asks:\n\n\n\nWhat monstrous Doctrine is this? to suffer Women to be Preachers by\nway of authority, condemned as against nature Isaiah 3.12. I\nCor. 14. 34, 35. 1 Tim. 2. 12. 14. This opinion was\nfirst held by the Pepuzians, that women might Preach, because they\nwickedly affirmed Christ assumed the form of a woman, and not of a man.\nIn France, they allow not a woman to bee a ruler over the\naffairs of mens goods: But with us some women will be rulers over, and\ndirecters of mens consciences; for so amongst the Quakers, women\ncommonly teach as well as men. (Miller 1655, 27)\n\n\n\nMiller\u2019s reference to the \u201cmonstrous Doctrine\u201d of\nwomen preachers calls to mind the arguments of Protestant reformer John\nKnox (c. 1514\u20131572) a generation before. In his 1558 work, The\nFirst Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of\nWomen, Knox urges his readers to rebel against female authority.\nHe points out that it is repugnant to nature that the weak shall lead\nthe strong, or that the foolish and mad shall govern the \u201csober\nof mind\u201d (Knox 1558, 9). Nature informs us that women are\nphysically frail, mentally feeble, and generally lacking in the\nnecessary leadership virtues. Knox supports this view with reference to\nscriptural claims that it is a virtue for women to be submissive and\nsubject to men. As part of the legacy of Eve\u2019s transgression, he\npoints out, the Bible states that man shall be lord and governor over\nwoman (Genesis 3:16). He also observes that the apostle Paul (again, in\nTimothy and Corinthians) deprives women of \u201call power and\nauthoritie, to speake, to reason, to interprete, or to teache, but\nprincipallie to rule or to judge in the assemblie of men\u201d (Knox\n1558, 16).\n",
