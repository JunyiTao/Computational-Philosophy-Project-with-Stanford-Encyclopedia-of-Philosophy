    "main_text": "Foundations of the Harm Principle || Perfectionist/Value-Pluralist Foundations\n6.2 Perfectionist/Value-Pluralist Foundations\n\nIn recent years, value-pluralist perfectionism has been more\ninfluential than utilitarianism as a foundation for the harm\nprinciple, whether argued for explicitly or assumed (Raz 1986; Gardner\n& Shute 2000; Simester & Von Hirsch 2011; Edwards 2014, 2018\n[2021]). Joseph Raz\u2019s classic work The Morality of\nFreedom contains a defence of the harm principle (Raz 1986; cf.\nRaz 1989\u2014other leading accounts of perfectionism include Hurka\n1993 and Sher 1997). Raz claims that\n\n\nthe autonomy-based principle of freedom is best regarded as providing\nthe moral foundation for the harm principle. (Raz 1986: 400)\n\n\nAt first sight this may be surprising, given the openness of\nperfectionists to moral reasons in general, an openness that might\nsuggest legal moralism is its natural home so far as the limits of law\nare concerned. Raz asserts that there is \u201cno fundamental\nprincipled inhibition on governments acting for any moral\nreason\u201d (Raz 1989: 1230, emphasis added). Even reasons that are\nnot \u201cneutral\u201d, or not \u201cpublic\u201d or some such\nare not in principle excluded by perfectionism (cf. G. Dworkin 2007).\nAgain: \u201cIt makes no sense to say of a state of affairs that it\nis good, but that fact is no reason to do anything about it\u201d\n(Raz 1989: 1230). By the same token, presumably, one could substitute\nthe word \u201cbad\u201d for \u201cgood\u201d in the previous\nsentence and the proposition would remain accurate. Thus our starting\npoint is that the law should have available to it any moral reason and\nhas the function to promote the quality of life, including the moral\nquality of life, of those whose lives and actions the government can\naffect (Raz 1986: 415). This aspect of perfectionism is apt to make\nsome fear the oppressive imposition of styles of life on unwilling\nindividuals (Sher 1997: 106).\n\nHowever, such alarmism cannot fairly be applied to a perfectionist\nview such as Raz\u2019s. It is not that anything one might\ndescribe, rightly or wrongly, as a moral reason will do. Raz\u2019s\nconcern is limited to states with \u201cautonomy-respecting\ncultures\u201d and with what it is to live a good life in such\nsocieties. The key, as the phrase \u201cautonomy-respecting\nculture\u201d would suggest, is autonomy. It is a state\u2019s\nprimary duty in the relevant kind of society to promote, protect and\nfoster the autonomy of all citizens. This requires\u2014on\nRaz\u2019s account\u2014furnishing all with, or preserving for all,\nan \u201cadequate range of valuable options\u201d. It also requires\nseeing to it that persons have the appropriate mental and other\ncapacities to be genuine choosers in conditions of freedom and\nindependence (Raz 1986: 372\u2013373).\n\nGiven, then, that Raz\u2019s starting point is that there is no\nprincipled inhibition to the law deploying any valid moral reason, an\naccount is plainly needed of how that can be reconciled with his\nsupport for the harm principle, a large part of the point of which is\nto rule out certain moral reasons. But before coming to that, it will\nbe helpful to dwell on autonomy a little longer. In\n section 2.2\n above, the familiar distinction between two kinds of liberty,\nnegative and positive, and a similar distinction within liberal\nfeminist writing, were noted. Autonomy-based accounts plainly go\nbeyond negative liberty as the absence of obstacles, barriers or\nconstraints, and embrace the notions of positive liberty, in terms of\nauthorship (or part-authorship) of one\u2019s own life, ability to\nchoose between options, realize purposes within bounds as the case may\nbe. Furthermore, autonomy is often contrasted with heteronomy. As\nMarilyn Friedman puts it,\n\n\nheteronomy\u2026involves behaving or living in accord with what is\nin some important sense not, or other than,\none\u2019s own. (Friedman 2005: 155, author\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nThere are at least two senses, as she continues, of heteronomy, one\nwhose sources \u201carise within the self, considered in abstract\nsocial isolation;\u201d the other whose sources \u201cderive from\ninterpersonal relations and the treatment of a self by others\u201d\n(Friedman 2005: 155). The first sense is of course important. It\nrelates, for one thing, to the very real problems that can emerge when\nan agent\u2019s \u201cdesires, emotions, passions, inclinations,\ndrives\u201d are not in good order, or where the agent is addicted or\nin the grip or a compulsion (Friedman 2005: 155). However, for all its\nimportance, Friedman argues that heteronomy in this sense has been the\n\u201calmost exclusive\u201d focus in mainstream philosophy. The\nsorts of heteronomy that are by contrast based on interpersonal\nrelations and the way some agents are treated by others, has been\nlargely neglected outside of liberal feminist circles, where\n\u201crelational autonomy\u201d has received considerable attention\n(Friedman 2005: 171; cf. Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000; Friedman 2003;\nStoljar 2018). This has led to the underplaying of such phenomena of\nconsiderable importance to autonomy as male dominance. Interestingly,\nFriedman explicitly cites Raz\u2019s account of autonomy as a rare\nexception to the neglect by the mainstream of the social or\ninterpersonal aspects of autonomy ((Friedman 2005: 171).\n\nThus the criticism sometimes levelled at perfectionist accounts of the\ngood life, government or law, that they imply the oppressive\nimposition of styles of life, looks unlikely to get much traction on a\nform of liberal perfectionism, such as Raz\u2019s, with autonomy for\nall so embedded in it. This, however, does not explain how an account\nsuch as Raz\u2019s can explain its adoption of an anti-moralist harm\nprinciple in tandem with its in-principle openness to all valid moral\nreasons. In other words, how can one derive an anti-moralist harm\nprinciple from a position that takes any valid moral ground as in\nprinciple available to the state and the law?\n\nRaz\u2019s answer focusses on the coercive means at the\nlaw\u2019s disposal:\n\nThere are no principled limits to the pursuit of moral goals by\nthe law or the enhancement of the well-being of individuals on the\npart of the law.\nThere are (nevertheless) limits to the means that can\nlegitimately be adopted in promoting the well-being of people and in\nthe pursuit of moral ideals (Raz 1986: 420; George 1993:\n161\u2013188).\n\n\nHis autonomy principle \u201cpermits and even requires governments to\ncreate morally valuable opportunities, and to eliminate repugnant\nones\u201d (Raz 1986: 417). It must, however, respect the harm\nprinciple in doing this. It must not use coercion to\neliminate repugnant, wrongful opportunities if they are not also\nharmful in the relevant sense. Coercive interference is a special\nthreat to autonomy. It often violates autonomy in two ways:\n\n\nFirst it violates the condition of independence and expresses a\nrelation of domination and an attitude of disrespect for the coerced\nindividual. Second, coercion by criminal penalties is a global and\nindiscriminate invasion of autonomy. (Raz 1986: 418)\n\n\nLet us consider both points, beginning with the second. In what sense\nis the use of coercion a \u201cglobal and indiscriminate invasion of\nautonomy\u201d? There is no doubt that sometimes it is.\n\u201cDepriving a person of opportunities or of the ability to use\nthem is\u201d, as Raz says, \u201ca way of causing him harm\u201d.\nAgain \u201cfrustrating [a person\u2019s] pursuit of projects and\nrelationships he has set upon\u201d can cause harm (Raz 1986: 413).\nRaz alludes to the most common context for the invocation of the harm\nprinciple, namely the criminal law. Much behaviour that is\ncriminalized is done under the threat of imprisonment and imprisonment\ncan cut off a very large range of options; or it can reduce\nthem considerably by various forms of disruption or destruction: of\nfamily life, deep personal relations, work opportunities, pursuit of\nvaluable outdoor activities, political participation and so on.\nRichard Lippke distinguishes between the material and the symbolic\ndimensions of imprisonment. The symbolic dimensions relate to what\nmessage the fact of imprisonment conveys to the public and to the\nprisoner. The material dimensions break down into\n\nrestrictions on freedom of movement,\nlow levels of comfort and amenity\nidleness, especially a paucity of opportunities for labour,\nrelative isolation from family members, friends, and the larger\ncommunity,\nsignificant diminution of autonomy especially insofar as prisons\nsubject their inhabitants to a degree of bureaucratic control which\nmight be categorised as the \u201csubservience of youth\u201d\nand\ndiminishment of privacy (Lippke 2008: 408; cf. Lippke 2007).\n\n\nThough only one of Lippke\u2019s six material dimensions explicitly\nmentions autonomy, all have some significant effect on it. Moreover, a\nsimilar point applies to the compulsory detention in certain\ncircumstances of mentally disordered persons under the civil law. All\nof Lippke\u2019s material dimensions can be present there too; and,\nwhile the symbolic dimensions of a criminal conviction and punishment\nare absent, the often-attendant stigma can compromise the autonomy of\nthe detained mentally disordered person in question still further\n(Stanton-Ife 2012).\n\nRaz, then, is right that coercion by criminal penalties can be\n\u201ca global and indiscriminate invasion of autonomy\u201d,\nHowever, there seem to be two problems with this as a basis for\nreconciling perfectionism and the harm principle. First, the scope of\nthe justification seems significantly limited; while the criminal\npenalties can have such an effect, they often will not. For\nthere are many more forms of criminal law coercion in regular use than\nimprisonment: fines, community service orders and electronic tagging\norders are three examples. These methods short of imprisonment can\naffect options, without necessarily leaving the convicted criminal\nshort of an adequate range of valuable options\u2014in\nRaz\u2019s terminology; the assault on autonomy will not in most be\ntotal or near-total. Take the last-mentioned example: the mandatory\nwearing of electronic tagging devices. There have been several\nhigh-profile cases of sports stars and other celebrities being\nrequired to wear such devices. An early example is the English soccer\nplayer, Jermaine Pennant. He broke into the first team of a top\nprofessional team\u2014the stuff that most English lads\u2019 dreams\nare made of!\u2014but, soon after, was convicted of a drunk-driving\noffence. His sentence required him to wear an electronic tag but\nallowed him to play in top division games with his tag under his\n sock.[12]\n Despite the cloud he was under he certainly did not appear to have an\ninadequate range of valuable options. The argument at best seems to\nsupport the deployment of the harm principle only where lengthy\nperiods of incarceration are deployed or threatened.\n\nRaz does acknowledge that \u201cother forms of coercion may be less\nsevere\u201d. However, he adds that\n\n\nthey all invade autonomy, and they all, at least in this world, do it\nin a fairly indiscriminate way. That is, there is no practical way of\nensuring that the coercion will restrict the victims\u2019 choice of\nrepugnant options but will not interfere with their other choices.\n(Raz 1986: 418\u2013419)\n\n\nLeaving the criminal law to one side, there are other legal contexts\nwhere Raz intends the harm principle to apply where this argument\nappears overstated. Consider tax. Of the operation of the harm\nprinciple in relation to taxation, Raz writes:\n\n\nthe measures I [support] avoid direct coercion for perfectionist\ncauses. The coercion that they involve can be fully justified on the\ngrounds of protecting and promoting individual autonomy. The simplest\nexample is that of taxation. Taxation is coercive. It is justified in\nmy view only inasmuch as it is useful for the promotion and protection\nof autonomy for all. (Raz 1989: 1232)\n\n\nRaz takes taxation to be coercive (indirectly) and argues it should be\nraised only subject to the terms of the harm principle. But the\nderivation of a perfectionist harm principle here cannot be based on\nany \u201cglobal and indiscriminate\u201d invasion of autonomy,\nbecause tax\u2014except in extreme cases where imposed\noppressively\u2014does not attack autonomy that hard and, if\nsuitably progressive, should leave the person taxed with her abilities\nto choose between an adequate range of valuable options intact\n(Stanton-Ife 2017). Of course, taxation, conceived in this way, does\nnot imply what Raz elsewhere describes as \u201ca coercive imposition\nof a style of life\u201d (Raz 1986: 161). This seems to reveal that a\nmuch more nuanced account of coercion, in its various manifestations,\nis required, not that coercion \u201cin this world\u201d is always\n\u201cglobal and indiscriminate\u201d,\n\nThe second problem with Raz\u2019s (correct) observation that\ncoercion by criminal penalties can on occasion be \u201ca global and\nindiscriminate invasion of autonomy\u201d, is summarized in the\nquestion \u201cwhat follows when it is?\u201d What does\nfollow, surely, is that such coercion must shoulder a large burden of\njustification. What does not appear to follow is anything to do with\nwhat kind of valid moral reason\u2014be it harm-based or\nwrong-based\u2014should be doing the needed justificatory work. The\nperfectionist starting point, as we have seen, is that there are no\nprincipled limits to the pursuit of moral goals by the law. It is the\njob of the harm principle to provide them if the harm principle can be\nsuccessfully derived. Pointing to global and indiscriminate coercion\npoints us to something that requires justification, but not yet to\nwhat kind of justification is needed.\n\nAs noted above Raz has another argument for liberal\nperfectionism\u2019s right to claim the harm principle for its own:\nnamely coercion\n\n\nviolates the condition of independence and expresses a relation of\ndomination and an attitude of disrespect for the coerced individual.\n(Raz 1986: 418)\n\n\nMight this argument make up the slack? Gerald Dworkin counters that\ncoercing someone based on their wrongful or immoral behaviour need not\nshow disrespect for such a person, \u201cbut merely for his\nconduct\u201d (G. Dworkin 2007: 447). Alternatively, if it be\naccepted that coercion is disrespectful and expresses a\nrelation of domination, one might again ask why that is not true of\nsomeone one coerces out of harming others as much as it is true of\ncoercing someone out of some morally wrongful conduct? In both cases,\ndoes the legitimacy of the coercion not turn on the presence of\nsufficient justification, be that harm-based or wrong-based?\nFurthermore, if the key argument for the harm principle is really\nbased on respect for independence and opposition to domination, it may\nseem particularly puzzling to identify how it is really a\nharm-based argument at all. It is true that independence, is\nfor Raz, part and parcel of his understanding of autonomy (Raz 1986:\n377\u2013378); and it is also true that he understands harm in terms\nof setbacks to autonomy. However, if the argument turns on\nindependence alone, the question arises of whether it does not\ncollapse into\u2014or keep sufficient distance from\u2014certain\nprinciples devised in explicit opposition to the harm principle, such\nas Arthur Ripstein\u2019s \u201csovereignty principle\u201d?\nRipstein argues that conduct should not be legally coerced if it does\nnot wrongfully interfere with the sovereignty of others (Ripstein\n2006: 231; for critique, see Tadros 2011).\n\nRaz\u2019s \u201cone simple reason\u201d why \u201cthe harm\nprinciple is defensible in the light of the principle of\nautonomy\u201d, viz. that \u201cthe means used, coercive\ninterference, violates the autonomy of its victim\u201d (Raz 1986:\n418) runs into the difficulty that often coercion does not do that or\ndoes not do that very significantly, let alone globally and\nindiscriminately. Furthermore, where coercion does violate autonomy\nglobally and indiscriminately, it is either wrongful all things\nconsidered or justifiable only on the basis of strong valid reasons,\nwhich may include (exclusively) wrongness-based reasons for all that\nis as yet established. Finally, to the extent that the argument turns\non independence it is not clear that harm is really doing the\nwork.\n",
