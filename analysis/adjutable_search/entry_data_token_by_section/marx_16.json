    "main_text": "Economics || Labour Theory of Value\n4.2 Labour Theory of Value\n\nCapital Volume 1 begins with an analysis of the idea of\ncommodity production. A commodity is defined as a useful external\nobject, produced for exchange on a market. Thus, two necessary\nconditions for commodity production are: the existence of a market, in\nwhich exchange can take place; and a social division of labour, in\nwhich different people produce different products, without which there\nwould be no motivation for exchange. Marx suggests that commodities\nhave both use-value\u2014a use, in other words\u2014and an\nexchange-value\u2014initially to be understood as their price. Use\nvalue can easily be understood, so Marx says, but he insists that\nexchange value is a puzzling phenomenon, and relative exchange values\nneed to be explained. Why does a quantity of one commodity exchange\nfor a given quantity of another commodity? His explanation is in terms\nof the labour input required to produce the commodity, or rather, the\nsocially necessary labour, which is labour exerted at the average\nlevel of intensity and productivity for that branch of activity within\nthe economy. Thus the labour theory of value asserts that the value of\na commodity is determined by the quantity of socially necessary labour\ntime required to produce it.\n\nMarx provides a two-stage argument for the labour theory of value. The\nfirst stage is to argue that if two objects can be compared in the\nsense of being put on either side of an equals sign, then there must\nbe a \u201cthird thing of identical magnitude in both of them\u201d\nto which they are both reducible. As commodities can be exchanged\nagainst each other, there must, Marx argues, be a third thing that\nthey have in common. This then motivates the second stage, which is a\nsearch for the appropriate \u201cthird thing\u201d, which is labour\nin Marx\u2019s view, as the only plausible common element. Both steps\nof the argument are, of course, highly contestable.\n\nCapitalism can be distinguished from other forms of commodity\nexchange, Marx argues, in that it involves not merely the exchange of\ncommodities, but the advancement of capital, in the form of money,\nwith the purpose of generating profit through the purchase of\ncommodities and their transformation into other commodities which can\ncommand a higher price, and thus yield a profit. Marx claims that no\nprevious theorist has been able adequately to explain how capitalism\nas a whole can make a profit. Marx\u2019s own solution relies on the\nidea of exploitation of the worker. In setting up conditions of\nproduction the capitalist purchases the worker\u2019s labour\npower\u2014his or her ability to labour\u2014for the day. The cost\nof this commodity is determined in the same way as the cost of every\nother; that is, in terms of the amount of socially necessary labour\npower required to produce it. In this case the value of a day\u2019s\nlabour power is the value of the commodities necessary to keep the\nworker alive for a day. Suppose that such commodities take four hours\nto produce. Accordingly the first four hours of the working day is\nspent on producing value equivalent to the value of the wages the\nworker will be paid. This is known as necessary labour. Any work the\nworker does above this is known as surplus labour, producing surplus\nvalue for the capitalist. Surplus value, according to Marx, is the\nsource of all profit. In Marx\u2019s analysis labour power is the\nonly commodity which can produce more value than it is worth, and for\nthis reason it is known as variable capital. Other commodities simply\npass their value on to the finished commodities, but do not create any\nextra value. They are known as constant capital. Profit, then, is the\nresult of the labour performed by the worker beyond that necessary to\ncreate the value of his or her wages. This is the surplus value theory\nof profit.\n\nIt appears to follow from this analysis that as industry becomes more\nmechanised, using more constant capital and less variable capital, the\nrate of profit ought to fall. For as a proportion less capital will be\nadvanced on labour, and only labour can create value. In\nCapital Volume 3 Marx does indeed make the prediction that\nthe rate of profit will fall over time, and this is one of the factors\nwhich leads to the downfall of capitalism. (However, as pointed out by\nPaul Sweezy in The Theory of Capitalist Development (1942),\nthe analysis is problematic.) A further consequence of this analysis\nis a difficulty for the theory that Marx did recognise, and tried,\nalbeit unsuccessfully, to meet also in the manuscripts that make up\nCapital Volume 3. It follows from the analysis so far that\nlabour-intensive industries ought to have a higher rate of profit than\nthose which use less labour. Not only is this empirically false, it is\ntheoretically unacceptable. Accordingly, Marx argued that in real\neconomic life prices vary in a systematic way from values. Providing\nthe mathematics to explain this is known as the transformation\nproblem, and Marx\u2019s own attempt suffers from technical\ndifficulties. Although there are sophisticated known techniques for\nsolving this problem now there is a question about the degree to which\nthey do rescue Marx\u2019s project. If it is thought that the labour\ntheory of value was initially motivated as an intuitively plausible\ntheory of price then when the connection between price and value is\nrendered as indirect as it is in the final theory, the intuitive\nmotivation of the theory drains away. Others consider this to be a\nsuperficial reading of Marx, and that his general approach allows us\nto see through the appearances of capitalism to understand its\nunderlying basis, which need not coincide with appearances. How\nMarx\u2019s theory of capitalism should be read remains an active\narea of scholarly debate (Heinrich 2012).\n\nA further objection is that Marx\u2019s assertion that only labour\ncan create surplus value is unsupported by any argument or analysis,\nand can be argued to be merely an artefact of the nature of his\npresentation. Any commodity can be picked to play a similar role.\nConsequently, with equal justification one could set out a corn theory\nof value, arguing that corn has the unique power of creating more\nvalue than it costs. Formally this would be identical to the labour\ntheory of value (Roemer 1982). Nevertheless, the claims that somehow\nlabour is responsible for the creation of value, and that profit is\nthe consequence of exploitation, remain intuitively powerful, even if\nthey are difficult to establish in detail.\n\nHowever, even if the labour theory of value is considered discredited,\nthere are elements of his theory that remain of worth. The Cambridge\neconomist Joan Robinson, in An Essay on Marxian Economics\n(1942), picked out two aspects of particular note. First, Marx\u2019s\nrefusal to accept that capitalism involves a harmony of interests\nbetween worker and capitalist, replacing this with a class-based\nanalysis of the worker\u2019s struggle for better wages and\nconditions of work, versus the capitalist\u2019s drive for ever\ngreater profits. Second, Marx\u2019s denial that there is any\nlong-run tendency to equilibrium in the market, and his descriptions\nof mechanisms which underlie the trade-cycle of boom and bust. Both\nprovide a salutary corrective to aspects of orthodox economic\ntheory.\n",
