The Evaluative Tradition in Affective Science: Appraisal Theories \n\nRoughly around the time when the Evaluative Tradition became popular\nin philosophy, a parallel tradition emerged in affective science\nthrough the pioneering work of Magda Arnold and Richard Lazarus. What\npowered this development was in part the cognitivist revolution, the\nintellectual movement that replaced behaviorism in the 1960s and put\nthe cognitive processing of mental representations at the heart of the\nscience of psychology.\n\nArnold argued that emotion research had neglected to explain how\nemotions are elicited. To shed light on the matter, she introduced the\nnotion of appraisal, the process through which the\nsignificance of a situation for an individual is determined. Appraisal\ngives rise to attraction or aversion, and emotion is equated for\nArnold with this \n\n\nfelt tendency toward anything intuitively appraised as good\n(beneficial), or away from anything intuitively appraised as bad\n(harmful). (Arnold 1960: 171)\n\n\nSeveral authors prior to Arnold had acknowledged that emotions must be\nproduced by some sort of cognitive evaluation of the eliciting\ncircumstances, either in the form of a judgment, a thought, a\nperception, or an act of imagination. After all, it is quite clear\nthat the same stimulus can generate different emotions in different\npeople, or in the same person at different times, which suggests that\nit is not stimuli as such that elicit emotions, but stimuli as\nappraised.\n\nArnold (1960) was the first to subject the internal structure of the\nappraisal process to scientific investigation. Appraisals, she\nsuggested, are made along three primary dimensions: eliciting\ncircumstances can be evaluated as good or bad, present or absent, and\neasy to attain or avoid. For example, the cognitive evaluation that\ncauses fear can be described as the appraisal of an event as bad,\nabsent but possible in the future, and hard to avoid; whereas the\ncause of joy can be described as the appraisal of an event as good,\npresent and easy to maintain.\n\nBroadly speaking, appraisal theories of emotions are accounts of the\nstructure of the processes that extract significance from stimuli and\ndifferentiate emotions from one another. It is also frequently assumed\nthat appraisal is a dynamic process: appraisals are followed by\nre-appraisals, which follow changes in the environment and in internal\nvariables, and incrementally shape emotions over time.\n\nIt should be noted that appraisal theories do not properly qualify as\ntheories of what emotions are, even though individual appraisal\ntheorists often articulate such theories as a complement to their\ntheories of the structure of appraisal. More specifically, appraisal\ntheories are in principle compatible with theories of emotions that\nidentify them as evaluations, feelings, or motivations, as long as\nsuch theories acknowledge that appraisals play an essential role in\ndifferentiating emotions from one another. This being said, a great\nmany influential appraisal theorists\u2014including Arnold, Lazarus\nand Scherer\u2014offer theories of emotions that would best fit into\nthe Motivational Tradition.\n\nScientific theories have significantly developed our understanding of\nthe nature of appraisal, endowing it with even more structure than\nArnold originally envisioned (e.g., C. Smith & Ellsworth 1985;\nFrijda 1986; Lazarus 1991a,b; Roseman 1996; Scherer 2001; Ellsworth\n& Scherer 2003; Roseman & Smith 2001; Oatley &\nJohnson-Laird 1987).\n\nLazarus (1991b), for instance, introduced six structural dimensions of\nassessment, including (1) goal-relevance, (2) goal-congruence or\nincongruence, (3) type of ego-involvement, (4) blame or credit, (5)\ncoping potential, and (6) future expectancy. For example, guilt is\nassumed to be caused by the appraisal of an event as goal relevant,\ngoal-incongruent, involving a moral transgression, and one for which\nthe self is to blame (coping potential and future expectancy\nappraisals are left open). Lazarus\u2019 own theory of emotions is\nlabeled as cognitive-relational-motivational, because it holds that\n\n\n\nemotion is a complex state, an AB, with [appraisal] A as cause and B\nas a combination of an action tendency, physiological change, and\nsubjective affect, (Lazarus 1991a: 819) \n\n\nwhereby the appraisal is not just a cause of emotion but also a part\nof it (see Moors 2013 for a critique of this assumption).\n\nScherer et al. (2001) distinguished between sixteen dimensions of\nappraisal, labeled Stimulus Evaluation Checks (SECs), which can be\ngrouped into four classes: appraisals of relevance, appraisals of\nconsequences, appraisals of coping potential, and appraisals of\nnormative significance. On Scherer\u2019s component process model,\n\n\n\n[e]motion is defined as an episode of interrelated, synchronized\nchanges in the states of all or most of the five organismic subsystems\nin response to the evaluation of an external or internal stimulus\nevent as relevant to major concerns of the organism. (Scherer 2005:\n697) \n\n\nThe five organismic subsystems underlie five emotion components which,\nwhen engaged in coordinated changes, instantiate emotions: an\nappraisal, autonomic physiological changes, an action tendency, a\nmotor expression, and a subjective feeling. In his more recent\ncollaborative work (Moors & Scherer 2013), Scherer has suggested that\nthe point of each stimulus evaluation check is actually to determine\naction tendencies, which would give pride of place to the motivational\ncomponent and make his theory an evaluative-motivational hybrid (see\nalso Scherer & Moors forthcoming).\n\nA variant of appraisal theories has recently attracted some interest in\naffective computing, an interdisciplinary approach that combines\ninsights from affective science and computer science (see Picard\n1997). This is the Belief and Desire Theory of Emotions (BDTE)\ndeveloped by Reisenzein (2009a,b; see also Miceli & Castelfranchi\n2015). The BDTE holds that emotions are caused by a combination of\ncognitive evaluations (beliefs) and conative motivations (desires),\nwhereas standard appraisal theories postulate cognitive evaluations of\nmotive-congruence, which in effect assesses the degree to which the\nstimulus is congruent with the goals/desires of the agent.\n\nBDTE\u2019s core thesis is that emotions are elicited by hardwired\nmechanisms whose evolutionary function is to compare newly acquired\nbeliefs with existing desires and existing beliefs, thereby monitoring\nand updating the central representational system of humans (the\nbelief\u2013desire system). For example, suppose you have a belief\nthat your favorite candidate will lose the election and a desire that\nshe win the election (Reisenzein 2009a). Once new information that she\nhas in fact won the election is acquired, a belief-belief-comparator\nsystem produces a belief disconfirmation signal subjectively\nexperienced as surprise, and a belief-desire-comparator system\nproduces a desire fulfillment signal subjectively experienced as\npleasure. This in turn leads to adaptive responses which include a\nrefocusing of attention to the new content that one\u2019s favorite\ncandidate won, the deletion of the belief that one\u2019s favorite\ncandidate was going to lose, and the subjective experience of\nhappiness.\n\nTo generalize, emotions are for the BDTE combinations of belief\ndisconfirmation/confirmation signals and desire\nfulfillment/frustration signals experienced as, respectively,\nsurprise/expectancy confirmation and pleasure/displeasure, which blend\ninto an emergent experience of a specific emotion (e.g., happiness,\nfear, hope, etc.). These signals are non-conceptual, in the sense that\nthey do not presuppose concept use, and they bring about redirection\nof attention, updates of the belief and desire store, and, when above\nthreshold, distinctive subjective experiences.\n\nA challenge faced by appraisal theories concerns whether appraisals\nare causes of emotions, entailments of emotions, parts of emotions, or\nsome combination of the above. These questions raise complex conceptual issues we\ncannot address here (see Moors 2013), but they are essential for\nassessing the evidentiary support for appraisal theory. A long-running\ncritique of the research program (Oatley 1992; Parkinson &\nManstead 1992; Parkinson 1997; Russell 1987; Frijda 1993) has been\nthat the self-report evidence commonly taken to support a causal\ninterpretation of the relation between appraisals and emotions only\nsupports a relation of conceptual entailment between them because it\nunveils people\u2019s beliefs about what makes emotions\nappropriate rather than what causes emotions (see\nScherer 2009 for a response). \n",
