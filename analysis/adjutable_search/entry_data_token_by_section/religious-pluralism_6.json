    "main_text": "Religious Diversity and the Eternal Destiny of Humankind\n7. Religious Diversity and the Eternal Destiny of Humankind\n\nThe discussion of religious diversity thus far has been framed in\nterms of truth claims (in terms of justified belief) because it is\nincreasingly recognized by philosophers as the best way to access the\nmost important questions that the reality of such diversity forces\nupon us. Historically, however, there has been one specific\n\u201cdiversity issue\u201d with which philosophers of religion have\nbeen most concerned: the question of the eternal destiny of humankind,\nthat is, the question of who can spend eternity in God\u2019s\npresence\u2014who can obtain salvation.\n\nThose who are religious exclusivists on this question claim that\nthose, and only those, who have met the criteria set forth by one\nreligious perspective can spend eternity in God\u2019s\n presence.[7]\n Adherents of other religious perspectives, it is acknowledged, can\naffirm truth related to some or many issues. But with respect to the\nquestion of salvation (one\u2019s eternal destiny), a person must\ncome to understand and adhere to the unique way. Or, to be more\nspecific, as salvific exclusivists see it, the criteria for salvation\nspecified by the one correct religious perspective are both\nepistemologically necessary in the sense that those seeking salvation\nmust be aware of these conditions for salvation and ontologically\nnecessary in the sense that these conditions must really be met\n(Peterson et al. 2013,\n 322).[8]\n\nIt is important to note, though, that not only Christians are salvific\nexclusivists. For example, just as Christian salvific exclusivists\nmaintain that only those who respond appropriately to requirements set\nfor in Christian belief can spend eternity in God\u2019s presence,\nMuslim salvific exclusivists maintain that \u201cwhether a person is\n\u2018saved\u2019 or not is principally determined by whether he or\nshe responded appropriately to Islamic belief\u201d (Aijaz 2014,\n194).\n\nAlso important to note is that differing, sometimes even conflicting,\nexclusivistic claims can exist within the same world religion. For\ninstance, significant intra-Christian debate has centered historically\non the eternal fate of young children who die. For some, the answer\nwas (and still is) that all children who die are separated from God\neternally. Others have believed that God \u201celects\u201d some for\nheaven and allows the rest to spend eternity in hell, while still\nothers have held that only the deceased children of believers are\nallowed to enter heaven or that salvation for children who die is tied\nto the sacrament of baptism. A more common belief today among\nChristians, though, is that all those who die in early childhood (or\ndie having possessed only the mental capacities of young children)\nenter automatically into God\u2019s eternal presence (Basinger 1992,\n4).\n\nBut what of those \u201cadults\u201d who die having never been aware\nof the salvific conditions of the one true religion? Is it not clearly\nunjust for exclusivists to claim that they cannot spend eternity with\nGod because they have not met the criteria for salvation stipulated by\nthis religion? For salvific inclusivists, the answer is yes. Like\nexclusivists, inclusivists believe that eternal existence in\nGod\u2019s presence is only possible because of the salvific\nprovisions noted in the one true religion. However, they do not\nmaintain \u201cthat only the believers or practitioners of that religion,\nduring their earthly lives, will be redeemed\u201d (Benton 2020).\nReligious inclusivists allow that some adherents of other religions\ncan be saved because of these provisions, even if the individuals in\nquestion haven\u2019t made the personal commitments normally\nstipulated as necessary to appropriate these salvific provisions. Put\nin philosophical language, as inclusivists see it, particular salvific\nevents may be ontologically necessary for salvation in the sense that\nsalvation cannot occur without them but not epistemically necessary in\nthe sense that one need not know about them to be saved or liberated\n(Moser 2011; Peterson et al. 2013, 334).\n\nProbably the best known Christian proponent of this inclusivist\nperspective is Karl Rahner. Christianity, he argues, cannot recognize\nany other religion as providing the way to salvation. However, since\nGod is love and desires everyone to be saved, God can apply the\nresults of Jesus\u2019s atoning death and resurrection to everyone,\neven to those who have never heard of Jesus and his death or have\nnever acknowledged his lordship. Just as adherents to pre-Christian\nJudaism were able, through the redemptive acts of Jesus of which they\nwere not aware, to enter God\u2019s presence, so, too, is it possible\nfor adherents of other religions to enter God\u2019s presence, even\nthough they are not aware of the necessary redemptive acts of Jesus\nthat makes this possible (Peterson et al. 2013, 334\u2013335).\n\nInclusivists, it should be noted, differ on the conditions such\n\u201canonymous Christians\u201d must meet. Some stipulate, for\ninstance, that those who have never heard \u201cthe gospel\u201d\nstill have both some innate knowledge of God and the freedom to\nestablish a relationship with God and, therefore, that the eternal\ndestiny of those in this category is dependent on the extent to which\nthey commit as much as they know of themselves to as much as they know\nof God through, or even apart from, a religion other than\nChristianity. Other inclusivists don\u2019t want to be as specific,\nmaintaining only that, because God is just, there will surely be some\nadherents of other religions who will be in God\u2019s presence\nbecause they have met some set of divine conditions they have it\nwithin their power to meet. But all agree these \u201canonymous\nChristians\u201d are the recipients of supernatural grace.\n\nMurtadha Mutahhari is a respected proponent of Muslim inclusivism. He\nmaintains that non-Muslims are at a disadvantage because it is the\nIslamic Divine Law that leads people to God. Those who fully\nunderstand this law (Islam) but choose not to accept the truth will be\ndamned. However, in accordance with Islamic jurisprudence, God will be\nmerciful to those who seek the truth but from whom, through no fault\nof their own, the reality of Islam remains hidden. Such people cannot\nbe called unbelievers; they are rather \u201cdispositional Muslims\u201d\nsince it is possible to possess the requisite spirit of submission\nwithout being Muslim in name. These individuals will receive the\ndivine grace necessary to achieve salvation from Hell (Mutahhari\n2006; Legenhausen 1997). Others go so far as to question whether\nMuslims can justifiably be exclusivists (Aijaz 2014).\n\nSalvific pluralists, however, find such reasoning no more convincing\nthan that offered by exclusivists. Inclusivists are right, pluralists\ngrant, to say that individuals need not necessarily know of or fulfill\ncertain requirements normally specified in a given religion to attain\nsalvation. But inclusivists, like exclusivists, are wrong to argue\nthat this salvation is, itself, possible only because of certain\nconditions or events described in the one true religion. There is no\none true religion and, therefore, no single path to eternal existence\nwith God.\n\nWhy, though, ought we consider this pluralistic salvific hypothesis\nmore plausible than that offered by the exclusivist or inclusivist?\nAccording to Hick, the most influential proponent of pluralism, three\nfactors make a pluralistic perspective the only plausible option.\nFirst, and foremost, he argues, is the reality of transformation\nparity. An efficacious salvific process is not just other-world\ncentered\u2014does not simply give individuals a \u201cticket\u201d\nto eternal existence with God. It begins \u201cthe transformation\nfrom self-centeredness to Reality-centeredness\u201d in this life\n(Hick 1984, 229). That is, an efficacious salvific process changes\nlives in the sense that it begins to turn people from thinking about,\nand acting only to enhance, their own personal well-being to viewing\nthemselves as responsible participants in a much greater, more\nexpansive reality. In short, an efficacious salvific process makes its\nparticipants better people. And all the evidence we have, Hick\nmaintains, shows that many religions are equally transformational,\ngiven any general standard for positive transformation we might want\nto consider (Hick 1989, chapter 3).\n\nThere continues to be debate, however, over whether the same basic\npersonal transformation actually does occur within various\nreligions\u2014over whether there is real transformational parity.\nFew claim that there is a strong experiential basis for denying such\ntransformational parity or that it can be demonstrated on other\nobjective, nonquestion-begging grounds that such parity does not\nexist. However, proponents of many basic theistic systems claim that\nwhile transformational parity may appear to be the case, this is\nactually not so\u2014that is, claim that the transformation within\ntheir systems actually is qualitatively different than that produced\nby allegiance to other systems. It is sometimes argued, for instance,\nthat the transformation within other systems will not last, or at\nleast that this transformation, while possibly real and even lasting\nfor a given individual, is not what it could have been for that\nindividual within the one true theistic system. And some exclusivists\nhave argued that unless it can be demonstrated in an objective,\nnonquestion-begging sense that they are not justified in affirming a\nreligious perspective that makes such claims (which even Hick does not\nattempt to demonstrate), they are justified in denying that such\nparity actually exists (Clark 1997, 303\u2013320).\n\nIt can also be argued that focusing on transformational parity can be\nused as an argument against salvific pluralism. The basis for this\nclaim is the fact that people making a \u201csecular\u201d\n(non-religious) commitment to some goal, value, or metaphysical\nperspective\u2014be it concern for the environment or world hunger or\nemotional health\u2014often appear to have their lives transformed in\nways quite similar to the ways in which the lives of religious\nbelievers are transformed. They, too, appear to have changed from\nself-centeredness to a focus on reality outside of self. If this is\nso, however, then might it not be that the religious transformational\nparity we observe is simply a sub-set of the general transformational\nparity we find among individuals who commit themselves to any\nperspective on life that centers reality outside of self, and thus\nthat it is just as plausible to assume that all religious\ntransformational parity is the result of some form of internal\nconceptual realignment than the result of some form of connection with\nan external divine reality? And if this is the case, then\ntransformational parity is at least weakened as support for any\nsalvific perspective, whether pluralistic, inclusivistic, or\nexclusivistic.\n\nSeeming transformational parity is not, however, Hick\u2019s only\nreason for believing non-pluralistic salvific perspectives to be\nuntenable. A credible perspective, he tells us, must account for the\nfact, \u201cevident to ordinary people (even though not always taken\ninto account by theologians) that in the great majority of\ncases\u2014say 98 to 99 percent\u2014the religion in which a person\nbelieves and to which he adheres depends upon where he was born\u201d\n(Hick 1980, 44). Given this fact\u2014given that \u201creligious\nallegiance depends in the great majority of cases on the accident of\nbirth\u201d\u2014it seems implausible to hold that \u201cbeing born\nin our particular part of the world carries with it the privilege of\nknowing the full religious truth\u201d (Hick 1997a, 287).\n\nThis contention, though, has also been challenged. No one denies that\nthe admittedly high correlation between where and when individuals are\nborn and the religious perspective they affirm is relevant and might\nin fact negatively affect an exclusivist\u2019s confidence. But many\nexclusivists deny that a pluralistic explanation should be seen as the\nonly plausible option. As they see it, exclusivists need not consider\nthe high place-time/religious allegiance correlation in question in\nisolation from other relevant beliefs. For example, Christian\nexclusivists need not consider this correlation in isolation from\ntheir basic belief that the Bible is an authoritative source of truth\nand that the Bible teaches that only the Christian perspective\ncontains a totally accurate view of reality. And it is justifiable,\nsome maintain, for exclusivists to consider the plausibility of such\nrelevant background beliefs to outweigh the seeming counterevidence\nposed by the correlation in question (Plantinga 2000, 187; Plantinga\n1997, 198).\n\nFinally, Hick argues, a credible religious hypothesis must account for\nthe fact, of which \u201cwe have become irreversibly aware in the\npresent century, as the result of anthropological, sociological, and\npsychological studies and the work of philosophy of language,\u201d\nthat there is no one universal and invariable pattern for the\ninterpretation of human experience, but rather a range of\nsignificantly different patterns or conceptual schemes \u201cwhich\nhave developed within the major cultural streams.\u201d When\nconsidered in this light, a \u201cpluralistic theory becomes\ninevitable\u201d (Hick 1984, 232).\n\nWhile no one denies that culture shapes reality to some extent, it can\nagain be argued that when comparing the plausibility of specific\nbeliefs, we must consider not only these specific beliefs themselves\nbut also the basic background beliefs in which they are embedded.\nThus, even if we grant that a pluralistic response to the obvious\nshaping power of culture is preferable to any exclusivistic response\nwhen such shaping power is considered in isolation, it isn\u2019t\nclear that exclusivists must acknowledge that Hick\u2019s hypothesis\nis so strong that it renders implausible the whole set of basic\nbackground beliefs out of which the exclusivist\u2019s response to\nthe profound shaping influence of culture on religious belief arises.\nHence, it isn\u2019t clear that exclusivists can\u2019t justifiably\nreject Hick\u2019s contention that a pluralistic cultural/religious\ninterpretation of reality must inevitably be considered superior.\n\nHick argues for salvific pluralism on what might best be called\nmetaphysical or epistemological grounds. Other philosophers, however,\nhave attempted to make a moral case for salvific pluralism (or at\nleast against salvific exclusivism.) For instance, Kenneth Himma has\nargued that moral considerations require Christian salvific\nexclusivism to be rejected (Himma 2002, 1\u201333). It follows both\nfrom God\u2019s perfection and conceptual truths about punishment,\nHimma maintains, that God would not punish individuals who are not\nmorally culpable for their behavior. But those with non-Christian\nbeliefs are generally not morally culpable for the fact that they hold\nthese beliefs. Not only is it not the case that any objective line of\nreasoning demonstrates the Christian (or any other religious) path to\nsalvation to be the correct one, religious traditions are, themselves,\nextremely elastic. That is, because of the shaping, foundational\nnature of basic religious belief, devout proponents of any given\nreligion are capable of (in fact, usually simply find themselves)\noffering self-consistent responses to almost any challenge to their\nsalvific perspective, no matter how strong or damaging this challenge\nmight seem on the surface. Furthermore, sociological, psychological,\nand anthropological studies have confirmed that while one\u2019s\nbasic religious beliefs are not inevitable, they are quite often to a\nsignificant extent \u201cbeyond the direct volitional control of the\nbeliever\u201d (Himma 2002, 18). So we must conclude, argues Himma,\nthat it would not be morally just for the Christian God to deny\nsalvation to devout people of other faiths.\n\nNot surprisingly, many inclusivists and pluralists will find this\nbasic line of reasoning persuasive. However, some (although not all)\nexclusivists reject the basic moral assumption on which Himma\u2019s\nargument is based: that we are in a position to correctly identify\nsome of the basic moral principles that guide God\u2019s interaction\nwith us as humans. Specifically, while many Christian exclusivists do\nbelieve that God\u2019s behavior is guided by the same basic\nprinciples of justice and fairness that are so fundamental to our\nhuman moral thinking, this is not true for all. There is a strong\nChristian tradition that holds that God is under no obligation to\ntreat any individual in what we would consider a just, fair fashion.\nGod can do what God wants (including how God responds to those who\nhaven\u2019t affirmed Christian beliefs) for whatever purposes God\nhas. What God does is right simply because God does\n it.[9]\n Even among those Christian exclusivists who come to acknowledge\nHimma\u2019s basic point\u2014that a just God cannot condemn those\nwho aren\u2019t culpable for their non-Christian beliefs\u2014the\nresponse has normally not been to reject their overall exclusivistic\nperspective. It is often simply assumed, rather, that\n\u201cGod\u2019s ways are above our ways\u201d in some manner\nunfathomable to the human mind.\n\nHowever, even if we were to agree with pluralists that both\nexclusivists and inclusivists are wrong to claim that the basis for\ntrue salvation can be found in only one religion, the question of what\ntype of pluralistic hypothesis we ought to affirm remains. Hick,\nhimself, favors what might be called a selective pluralism that\ncenters on the world\u2019s great religions. Hick has never denied\nthat the major world religions\u2014Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism,\nIslam\u2014make conflicting truth claims. In fact, he believes that\n\u201cthe differences of belief between (and within) the traditions\nare legion\u201d and has often discussed these conflicts in great\ndetail (Hick 1983, 487). His basic pluralistic claim, rather, is that\nsuch differences are best seen as differing ways in which differing\ncultures have conceived of and experienced the one ultimate divine\nReality. Each major religious perspective \u201cconstitutes a valid\ncontext of salvation/liberation; but none constitutes the one and only\nsuch context\u201d (Hick 1984, 229, 231).\n\nWhy, however, select only the paths offered by the world\u2019s great\nreligions as ways to salvation? For Hick, the answer lies in the fact\nthat, unlike \u201cSatanism, Nazism, the Order of the Solar Temple,\netc.,\u201d the world\u2019s great religions offer paths that lead\nus away from \u201chatred, misery, aggression, unkindness,\nimpatience, violence, and lack of self-control\u201d to love, joy,\npeace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and\nself-control (Hick 1997b, 164). Some, though, see this sort of ethical\nstandard for acceptable salvific perspectives to be as arbitrary as\nthe standard for acceptable paths to salvation set forth by\nexclusivists or inclusivists (Meeker 2003, 5). In fact, some have\nquestioned whether, given this rather specific ethical criterion for\nassessing the salvific adequacy of religions, Hick\u2019s perspective\nshould actually be considered pluralistic at all.\n\nS. Mark Heim, for instance, argues that pluralists such as Hick are\nreally inclusivists in disguise in that they advocate only one path to\nsalvation\u2014the transformation from self-centeredness to\nReality-centeredness\u2014and thus in essence deny that diverse\nreligions have real, fundamental salvific differences. A better, more\nhonest salvific pluralism, we are told, is to acknowledge that each\nreligion has its own path to salvation that may be either similar to\nor different from that of other religions. That is, a more honest\npluralistic perspective is to deny that the seemingly different\nsalvific paths offered by various religious traditions are all just\nculturally distinct manifestations of the same fundamental path and\nmaintain instead that salvific paths of various religions remain\nincompatible, but equally valid ways to achieve salvation. It is\nacknowledged that this is not to say, of course, that all the details\nof all the salvific paths are actually true since some of the relevant\nclaims are inconsistent. But the appropriate response to this is not\nto claim there is one true path to salvation. It is rather to claim\nthat many distinct paths, while remaining distinct, can lead to\nsalvation (Heim 1995).\n\nCritics, however, wonder whether part of this seeming disagreement is\nverbal in nature. Heim can appear to be bypassing the question of\nwhether there is some sort of final, ultimate eschatological salvific\nstate that the proponents of various religious perspectives will all\nexperience, emphasizing rather that many distinct religious paths can\nliberate people (produce salvation) here and now (Peterson et al.\n2013, 333). Hick, on the other hand, seems most concerned with the\nnature of salvific reality\u2014with what it means to experience\nsalvation\u2014while not denying that there exist in this world\ndistinct ways that remain distinct to access this ultimate\nreality.\n",
