Introduction\n\nAristotle was not the first thinker to engage in a causal\ninvestigation of the world around us. Quite the opposite: from the\nvery beginning, and independently of Aristotle, the investigation of\nthe natural world consisted in the search for the relevant causes of a\nvariety of natural phenomena. From the Phaedo, for example,\nwe learn that the so-called \u201cinquiry into nature\u201d\nconsisted in a search for \u201cthe causes of each thing; why each\nthing comes into existence, why it goes out of existence, why it\nexists\u201d (96 a 6\u201310). In this tradition of investigation,\nthe search for causes was a search for answers to the question\n\u201cwhy?\u201d.\n\nBoth in the Physics and in the Metaphysics Aristotle\nplaces himself in direct continuity with this tradition. At the\nbeginning of the Metaphysics, Aristotle offers a concise\nreview of the results reached by his predecessors (Metaph. I\n3\u20137). From this review we learn that all his predecessors were\nengaged in an investigation that eventuated in knowledge of one or\nmore of the following causes: material, formal, efficient, and final\ncause.\n\nHowever, Aristotle makes it very clear that all his predecessors (no\none excluded) merely touched upon these causes (Metaph. I 7,\n988 a 22\u201323). He equates them to boxers who lack boxing\ntechnique: while sometimes they can throw a nice punch, any punch that lands is only a lucky one (Metaph. I 4, 985 a 10\u201319). In other\nwords, even when his predecessors had valuable insights into\ncausality, they spoke without having proper knowledge. His view is\nthat they spoke about causes without making the relevant distinctions\nand without conveying clarity (they spoke amudr\u00f4s kai outhen\nsaph\u00f4s, Metaph I 4, 985 a 13).\n\nBy Aristotle\u2019s lights, all his predecessors engaged in their\ncausal investigation without a firm grasp of causality. They lacked a\ncomplete understanding of the range of possible causes and their\nsystematic interrelations. Put differently, their use of\ncausality was not supported by an adequate theory of\ncausality. According to Aristotle, this explains why their\ninvestigation, even when it resulted in important insights, was never\nentirely successful.\n\nThis insistence on the doctrine of the four causes as an indispensable\ntool for a successful investigation of the world around us explains\nwhy Aristotle provides his reader with a general account of the four\ncauses. This account is found, in almost the same words, in\nPhysics II 3 and Metaphysics V 2.\n2. The Four Causes\n\nIn the Posterior Analytics, Aristotle places the following\ncrucial condition on proper knowledge: we think we have knowledge of a\nthing only when we have grasped its cause (APost. I 2, 71 b\n9\u201311. Cf. APost. II 11, 94 a 20). That proper knowledge\nis knowledge of the cause is repeated in the Physics: we\nthink we do not have knowledge of a thing until we have grasped its\nwhy, that is to say, its cause (Phys. II 3, 194 b\n17\u201320). Since Aristotle obviously conceives of a causal\ninvestigation as the search for an answer to a why-question, and a\nwhy-question is a request for an explanation, it can be useful to\nthink of a cause as a certain type of explanation.\n\nThis last statement calls for a few words of elaboration. To be sure,\nnot all why-questions are requests for an explanation that identifies\na cause, let alone a cause in the particular sense envisioned by\nAristotle. Still, Aristotle is clearly committed to the view that\ngiving the relevant causes is necessary and sufficient for offering a\nscientific explanation. His conception of a cause has both a\nmetaphysical and an epistemological  component. Part\nof the challenge for us is to do justice to both components. Following\na recent suggestion, we may say that \u201ccauses are not ways in\nwhich we explain things, except derivatively, in virtue of the fact\nthat they are ways in which some elements of the natural world explain\nothers.\u201d (Stein 2012a: 705)\n\nIn Physics II 3 and Metaphysics V 2, Aristotle\noffers his general account of the four causes. This account is general\nin the sense that it applies to everything that requires an\nexplanation, including artistic production and human action. Here\nAristotle recognizes four different explanatory roles that a thing can\nplay. As a result, there are four different (kinds of) causes :\n\nThe material cause or that which is given in reply to the\nquestion \u201cWhat is it made out of?\u201d What is singled out in\nthe answer need not be material objects such as bricks, stones, or\nplanks. By Aristotle\u2019s lights, A and B are the material cause of\nthe syllable BA.\nThe formal cause or that which is given in reply to the\nquestion \u201c\"What is it?\u201d. What is singled out in the answer\nis the essence or the what-it-is-to-be something.\nThe efficient cause or that which is given in reply to\nthe question: \u201cWhere does change (or motion) come from?\u201d.\nWhat is singled out in the answer is the whence of change (or\nmotion).\nThe final cause is that which is given in reply to the\nquestion: \u201cWhat is its good?\u201d. What is singled out in\nthe answer is that for the sake of which something is done or takes\nplace.\n\n\nAll the four (kinds of) causes may enter in a non-coincidental way in\nthe explanation of something. Consider the production of an artifact\nlike a bronze statue. The bronze enters in the explanation of the\nproduction of the statue as the material cause. Note that the\nbronze is not only the material out of which the statue is made but it\nis also the subject of change, that is, the thing that undergoes the\nchange and results in a statue. The bronze is melted and poured in\norder to acquire a new shape, the shape of the statue. This shape\nenters in the explanation of the production of the statue as the\nformal cause. However, an adequate explanation of the production\nof a statue requires also a reference to the efficient cause\nor the principle that produces the statue. For Aristotle, this\nprinciple is the art of bronze-casting the statue (Phys. II\n3, 195 a 6\u20138. Cf. Metaph. V 2, 1013 b 6\u20139).\n\nThis result is mildly surprising and requires a few words of\nelaboration. There is no doubt that the art of bronze-casting resides\nin an individual artisan who is responsible for the production of the\nstatue. According to Aristotle, however, all the artisan does in the\nproduction of the statue is the manifestation of specific knowledge.\nThis knowledge, not the artisan who has mastered it, is the salient\nexplanatory factor that one should pick as the most accurate\nspecification of the efficient cause (Phys. II 3, 195 b\n21\u201325). \n\nBy picking the art, not the artisan, Aristotle is not just trying to\nprovide an explanation for the production of the statue which is not\ndependent upon the desires, beliefs, and intentions of the individual\nartisan; rather, he is trying to offer an entirely different type of\nexplanation\u2013namely, an explanation that does not make a\nreference (implicit or explicit) to desires, beliefs, and intentions.\nMore directly, the art of bronze-casting the statue enters in the\nexplanation as the efficient cause because it helps us to understand\nwhat it takes to produce a statue; that is to say, what steps are\nrequired to produce a statue starting from a piece of bronze.\n\nThe question for us is this: can an explanation of the kind outlined\nabove be given without reference to the final outcome of the\nproduction, namely the statue? The answer is emphatically\n\u201cno\u201d. A model is made for producing the statue. A mold is\nprepared for producing the statue. The bronze is melted and poured for\nproducing the statue. Both the prior and the subsequent stage are for\nthe sake of a certain end, the production of the statue. Clearly, the\nstatue enters in the explanation of each step of the artistic\nproduction as the final cause or that for the sake of which\neverything in the production process is done.\n\nIn thinking about the four causes, we have come to understand that\nAristotle offers a teleological explanation of the production\nof a bronze statue; that is to say, an explanation that makes a\nreference to the telos or end of the process. Moreover, a\nteleological explanation of the type sketched above does not crucially\ndepend upon the application of psychological concepts such as desires,\nbeliefs, and intentions. This is important because artistic production\nprovides Aristotle with a teleological model for the study of natural\nprocesses, whose explanation does not involve beliefs, desires,\nintentions, or anything of this sort. Some have objected that\nAristotle explains natural process on the basis of an inappropriately\npsychological teleological model; that is to say, a teleological model\nthat involves a purposive agent who is somehow sensitive to the end.\nThis objection can be met if the artistic model is understood in\nnon-psychological terms. In other words, Aristotle does not\npsychologize nature because his study of the natural world is based on\na teleological model that is consciously free from psychological\nfactors. (For a philosophically-minded reflection on the role that\nartistic production plays in developing an explanatory model for the\nstudy of nature, see Broadie 1987, pp. 35\u201350.)\n\nBy insisting on the art of bronze-casting as the most accurate\nefficient cause of the production of the statue, Aristotle does not\nmean to preclude an appeal to the beliefs and desires of the\nindividual artisan. On the contrary, there are cases where the\nindividual realization of the art obviously enters in the explanation\nof the bronze statue. For example, one may be interested in a\nparticular bronze statue because that statue is the great achievement\nof an artisan who has not only mastered the art but has also applied\nit with a distinctive style. In this case it is perfectly appropriate\nto make reference to the beliefs and desires of the artisan. Aristotle\nseems to make room for this case when he says that we should look\n\u201cfor general causes of general things and for particular causes\nof particular things\u201d (Phys. II 3, 195 b 25\u201326).\nNote, however, that the idiosyncrasies that may be important in\nstudying a particular bronze statue as the great achievement of an\nindividual artisan may be extraneous to a more central (and more\ninteresting, at least for Aristotle) case. To understand why let us\nfocus on the study of nature. When the student of nature is concerned\nwith the explanation of a natural phenomenon like the formation of\nsharp teeth in the front and broad molars in the back of the mouth,\nthe student of nature is concerned with what is typical about\nthat phenomenon. In other words, the student of nature is expected to\nprovide an explanation of why certain animals typically have\na certain dental arrangement. We shall return to this example in due\ncourse. For the time being, it is important to emphasize this\nimportant feature of the explanatory project attempted by Aristotle; a\nfeature that we must keep in mind in trying to understand his theory\nof causality. This theory has in fact been developed primarily (but\nnot exclusively) for the study of nature.\n\nSo far we have been looking at what Aristotle calls intrinsic\ncauses, where \u201cintrinsic\u201d is a translation of the\nGreek kath\u2019hauton. However, Aristotle contrasts these\n(kinds of) causes with the coincidental ones, where\n\u201ccoincidental\u201d is a translation of the Greek kata\nsumbeb\u00eakos.\n\nThis distinction can be appreciated by reflecting on our example of\nbronze-casting a statue. We have seen that the whence of motion is the\nartisan insofar as this person has mastered the art of bronze-casting\na statue. By Aristotle\u2019s light, the art of bronze-casting\ninsofar as is present in the artisan is the most accurate description\nof the efficient cause of the statue. This is also an intrinsic\nefficient cause of the statue. However, the person who is\nresponsible for bronze-casting the statue may be described in many\nother ways. For example, this person may be described as a woman, the\nsister of X, or the daughter of Y. Aristotle makes\nit very clear that these descriptions, important as they are, are not\nrelevant when it comes to giving the efficient cause of the statue\nbecause they do not enter in an explanatory relationship with the\nfinal outcome of the production process brings about, namely the\nbronze statue. In other words, saying that the daughter of X\nproduced the bronze statue does not convey any information as to how\nthe statue has come into being. In other words, this description is\nextrinsic to the production process. It just so happens, by\ncoincidence, that the artisan is the daughter of X or the\nsister of Y.\n\nThe distinction between intrinsic and coincidental causes helps us\nunderscore that the Aristotelian causes are expected to have\nexplanatory power.\n3. The Four Causes and the Study of Nature\n\nIn the Physics, Aristotle builds on his general account of\nthe four causes by developing explanatory principles that are specific\nto the study of nature. Here Aristotle insists that all four causes\nare involved in the explanation of natural phenomena. By his lights,\nthe job of \u201cthe student of nature is to bring the why-question\nback to them all in the way appropriate to the science of\nnature\u201d (Phys. II 7, 198 a 21\u201323). The best way\nto understand this methodological recommendation is the following: the\nstudy of nature is concerned with natural bodies insofar as they are\nsubject to change, and the job of the student of nature is to provide\nthe explanation of their natural change. The factors that are involved\nin the explanation of natural change turn out to be matter, form, that\nwhich produces the change, and the end of this change. Note that\nAristotle does not say that all four explanatory factors are involved\nin the explanation of each and every instance of natural change.\nRather, he says that an adequate explanation of natural change may\ninvolve a reference to all of them.\n\nAristotle goes on by adding a specification on his doctrine of the\nfour causes: the form and the end often coincide, and they are\nformally the same as that which produces the change (Phys. II\n7, 198 a 23\u201326). This is one of the several times where\nAristotle offers the slogan \u201cit takes a human being to generate\na human being\u201d (for example, Phys. II 2, 194 b 13;\nMetaph. VII 7, 1032 a 25; VII 8, 1033 b 32; IX 8, 1049 b 25;\nXII 3, 1070 a 8; XIV 5, 1092 a 16). This slogan is designed to draw\nattention to the following, fundamental fact: the generation of a\nhuman being can be understood only in light of the end of the process;\nthat is to say, the fully developed human being. The question thus\narises as to what it takes for a human being to be fully developed.\nAristotle frames his answer in terms of the human form, maintaining\nthat a human form is fully realized at the end of the generative\nprocess. This process does not end at birth but continues until the\nhuman being reaches its acme. But this does not explain why it takes\na human being to generate a human being. Note, however, that\na fully developed human being is not only the final outcome of the\ngenerative process; it is also what initiates the entire process. For\nAristotle, the ultimate moving principle responsible for the\ngeneration of a human being is a fully developed living creature of\nthe same kind; that is, a human being who is formally the same as the\nfinal result of the generative process. (A final clarification is in\norder here: Aristotle is committed to a hylomorphic explanation of\nanimal generation. His considered view is that the father supplies the\nform whereas the mother provides the relevant matter.) \n\nThus, the student of nature is often left with three types of causes:\nthe formal/final cause, the efficient cause, and the material cause.\nHowever, the view that there are in nature causes besides material and\nefficient causes was controversial in antiquity. According to\nAristotle, most of his predecessors recognized only the material and\nthe efficient cause. This explains why Aristotle cannot be content\nwith saying that formal and final causes often coincide, but he also\nhas to defend his thesis against an opponent who denies that final\ncausality is a genuine mode of causality.\n4. Final Causes Defended\n\nPhysics II 8 contains Aristotle\u2019s most general defense\nof final causality. Here Aristotle establishes that explaining nature\nrequires final causality by discussing a difficulty that may be\nadvanced by an opponent who denies that there are final causes in\nnature. Aristotle shows that an opponent who claims that material and\nefficient causes alone suffice to explain natural change fails to\naccount for their characteristic regularity. Before considering how\nthe defense is attempted, it is important to clarify that this defense\ndoes not perform the function of a proof. By showing that an approach\nto the study of nature that ignores final causality cannot account for\na crucial aspect of nature, Aristotle does not thereby prove that\nthere are final causes in nature. Strictly speaking, the only way to\nprove that nature exhibits final causality is to establish it on\nindependent grounds. But this is not what Aristotle does in\nPhysics II 8. Final causality is here introduced as the best\nexplanation for an aspect of nature which otherwise would remain\nunexplained.\n\nThe difficulty that Aristotle discusses is introduced by considering\nthe way in which rain works. It rains because of material processes\nwhich can be specified as follows: when the warm air that has been\ndrawn up is cooled off and becomes water, then this water comes down\nas rain (Phys. II 8, 198 b 19\u201321). It may happen that\nthe corn in the field is nourished or the harvest is spoiled as a\nresult of the rain, but it does not rain for the sake of any good or\nbad result. The good or bad result is just a coincidence\n(Phys. II 8, 198 b 21\u201323). So, why cannot all natural\nchange work in the same way? For example, why cannot it be merely a\ncoincidence that the front teeth grow sharp and suitable for tearing\nthe food and the molars grow broad and useful for grinding the food\n(Phys. II 8, 198 b 23\u201327)? When the teeth grow in just\nthis way, then the animal survives. When they do not, then the animal\ndies. More directly, and more explicitly, the way the teeth grow is\nnot for the sake of the animal, and its survival or its death is just\na coincidence (Phys. II 8, 198 b 29\u201332).\n\nAristotle\u2019s reply is that the opponent is expected to explain\nwhy the teeth regularly grow in the way they do: sharp teeth\nin the front and broad molars in the back of the mouth. Moreover,\nsince this dental arrangement is suitable for biting and chewing the\nfood that the animal takes in, the opponent is expected to explain the\nregular connection between the needs of the animal and the\nformation of its teeth. Either there is a real causal connection\nbetween the formation of the teeth and the needs of the animal, or\nthere is no real causal connection and it just so happens that the way\nthe teeth grow is good for the animal. In this second case it is just\na coincidence that the teeth grow in a way that it is good for the\nanimal. But this does not explain the regularity of the\nconnection. Where there is regularity there is also a call for an\nexplanation, and coincidence is no explanation at all. In other words,\nto say that the teeth grow as they do by material necessity, and to\nsay that this is good for the animal by coincidence is to leave\nunexplained the regular connection between the growth of the teeth and\nthe needs of the animal. Aristotle offers final causality as his\nexplanation for this regular connection: the teeth grow in the way\nthey do for biting and chewing food and this is good for the animal.\n(See Code 1997: 127\u2013134.)\n\nOne thing to be appreciated about Aristotle\u2019s reply is that the\nfinal cause enters in the explanation of the formation of the parts of\nan organism like an animal as something that is good either\nfor the existence or the flourishing of the animal. In the first case,\nsomething is good for the animal because the animal cannot survive\nwithout it; in the second case, something is good for the animal\nbecause the animal is better off with it. This helps us to understand\nwhy in introducing the concept of end (telos) that is\nrelevant to the study of natural processes Aristotle insists on its\ngoodness: \u201cnot everything that is last claims to be an end\n(telos), but only that which is best\u201d (Phys.\nII 8, 194 a 32\u201333).\n\nOnce his defense of the use of final causes is firmly in place,\nAristotle can make a step further by focusing on the role that matter\nplays in his explanatory project. Let us return to the example chosen\nby Aristotle, the regular growth of sharp teeth in the front and broad\nmolars in the back of the mouth. What explanatory role is left for the\nmaterial processes involved in the natural process? Aristotle does not\nseem to be able to specify what material processes are involved in the\ngrowth of the teeth, but he is willing to recognize that certain\nmaterial processes have to take place for the teeth to grow in the\nparticular way they do. In other words, there is more to the formation\nof the teeth than these material processes, but this formation does\nnot occur unless the relevant material processes take place. For\nAristotle, these material processes are that which is necessary to the\nrealization of a specific goal; that which is necessary on the\nhypothesis that the end is to be obtained.\n\nHypothetical necessity is often equated to conditional necessity. But\nthis equation can be a first approximation at best. Stating the\nconditions under which something is the case is not yet giving a\nsuccessful explanation. In other words, conditional necessity is a\nwider, and indeed weaker, notion than hypothetical necessity (I refer\nthe reader to Stein 2016: 353\u2013382 for a lucid reflection on this\npoint).\n\nPhysics II 9 is entirely devoted to the introduction of the\nconcept of hypothetical necessity and its relevance for the\nexplanatory ambition of Aristotle\u2019s science of nature. In this\nchapter, matter is reconfigured as hypothetical necessity. By so doing\nAristotle acknowledges the explanatory relevance of the material\nprocesses, while at the same time he emphasizes their dependency upon\na specific end.\n5. The Explanatory Priority of Final Causes\n\nIn the Physics, Aristotle builds on his general account of\nthe four causes in order to provide the student of nature with the\nexplanatory resources indispensable for a successful investigation of\nthe natural world. However, the Physics does not provide\nall the explanatory resources for all natural\ninvestigations. Aristotle returns to the topic of causality in the\nfirst book of the Parts of Animals. This is a relatively\nindependent and self-contained treatise entirely devoted to developing\nthe explanatory resources required for a successful study of animals\nand animal life. Here Aristotle completes his theory of causality by\narguing for the explanatory priority of the final cause over the\nefficient cause.\n\nSignificantly enough, there is no attempt to argue for the existence\nof four fundamental modes of causality in the first book of the\nParts of Animals. Evidently, Aristotle expects his reader to\nbe already familiar with his general account of the four causes as\nwell as his defense of final causality. The problem that here concerns\nAristotle is presented in the following way: since both the final and\nthe efficient cause are involved in the explanation of natural\ngeneration, we have to establish what is first and what is second\n(PA 639 b 12\u201313). Aristotle argues that there is no\nother way to explain natural generation than by reference to what lies\nat the end of the process. This has explanatory priority over the\nprinciple that is responsible for initiating the process of\ngeneration. Aristotle relies on the analogy between artistic\nproduction and natural generation, and the teleological model that he\nhas developed for the explanation of artistic production. Consider,\nfor example, house-building. There is no other way to explain how a\nhouse is built, or is being built, than by reference to the final\nresult of the process, the house. More directly, the bricks and the\nbeams are put together in the particular way they are for the sake of\nachieving a certain end: the production of the house. This is true\nalso in the case of natural generation. In this context\nAristotle\u2019 slogan is \u201cgeneration is for the sake of\nsubstance, not substance for the sake of generation\u201d\n(PA 640 a 18\u201319). This means that the proper way to\nexplain the generation of an organism like an animal, or the formation\nof its parts, is by reference to the product that lies at the end of\nthe process; that is to say, a substance of a certain type.\n\nFrom Aristotle we learn that Empedocles explained the articulation of\nthe human spine into vertebrae as the result of the twisting and\nturning that takes place when the fetus is in the womb of the mother.\nAristotle finds this explanation unacceptable (PA 640 a\n19\u201326). To begin with, the fetus must have the power to twist\nand turn in the way it does, and Empedocles does not have an\nexplanation for this fact. Secondly, and more importantly, Empedocles\noverlooks the fact that it takes a human being to generate a\nhuman being. That is to say, the originating principle of the\ngeneration is a fully developed human being which is formally the same\nas the final outcome of the process of generation. It is only by\nlooking at the fully developed human being that we can understand why\nour spine is articulated into vertebrae and why the vertebrae are\narranged in the particular way they are. This amounts to finding the\nrole that the spine has in the life of a fully developed human being.\nMoreover, it is only by looking at the fully developed human being\nthat we can explain why the formation of the vertebrae takes place in\nthe particular way it does. (For further information about the\nexplanatory priority of the final over the efficient cause, see Code\n1997: 127\u2013143.)\n\nPerhaps we are now in the position to understand how Aristotle argues\nthat there are four kinds of causes and at the same time says that\nproper knowledge is knowledge of the cause or knowledge of\nthe why (APost. I 2, 71 b 10\u201312, II 11, 94 a\n20; Phys. II 3, 194 b 17\u201320; Metaph. I 1, 981\na 28\u201330). Admittedly, at least at first sight, this is a bit\nconfusing. Confusion dissolves when we realize that Aristotle\nrecognizes the explanatory primacy of the final/formal cause over the\nefficient and material cause. Of course this does not mean that the\nother causes can be eliminated or reduced to the formal cause. Quite\nthe contrary: Aristotle is adamant that, for a full range of cases,\nall four causes must be given in order to give an explanation. More\nexplicitly, for a full range of cases, an explanation which fails to\ninvoke all four causes is no explanation at all. At the same time,\nhowever, the final/formal cause is the primary cause and knowledge of\nthis cause amounts to knowledge of the why.\n6. The Explanation of a Lunar Eclipse\n\nWe have already seen that Aristotle is not committed to the view that\neverything has all four kinds of causes, Rather, his view is that a\nscientific explanation requires up to four kinds of causes. We may\nillustrate this point with the help of an example. Consider, in\nparticular, the case of a lunar eclipse. In the Metaphysics,\nAristotle says that an eclipse of the moon does not have a final cause\n(Metaph. VIII 4, 1044 b 12). He also says that, strictly\nspeaking, a lunar eclipse does not have matter. Rather, it has a cause\nthat plays a role analogous to matter. This second claim can\nbe inferred from what Aristotle says about the things that exist by\nnature but are not substances. With respect to these things, Aristotle\nsays that they do not have matter but rather something that underlies\n(Metaph. VIII 4, 1044 b 8\u20139). In the case of a lunar\neclipse, that which underlies is the subject affected by the eclipse,\nthat is, the moon. The moon is not strictly speaking the matter of the\neclipse but rather the subject that undergoes an eclipse when the\nearth comes in the middle between the moon and the sun. Should we give\nthe earth as the efficient cause of a lunar eclipse? We have to be\ncareful here. By saying that the moon is a deprivation of light caused\nby the earth, we distinguish this particular deprivation of light from\nother kinds of deprivation of light. Still, by citing the earth as the\nefficient cause of a lunar eclipse, we are not yet giving the most\nprecise description of the efficient cause. More directly, we are not\nyet saying what the earth is doing to cause a lunar eclipse. A lunar\neclipse is a deprivation of light caused by the interposition of the\nearth between the sun and the moon. By coming in the middle of the\nmoon and the sun the earth blocks the light and causes the moon to\nsuffer an eclipse. Hence, it is the interposition of the earth between\nthe sun and the moon is the proximate efficient cause of a\nlunar eclipse. Citing the proximate efficient cause is also giving the\nmost accurate description, and indeed the full explanation, of a lunar\neclipse. (An insightful discussion of how Aristotle explains natural\nphenomena such as a lunar eclipse and sleep can be found in Code 2015:\n11\u201345).\n\nThis brief discussion of the explanation of an eclipse of the moon\nbrings us back to a point that was already made in connection with\nAristotle\u2019s explanation of the production of an artifact such as\na bronze statue. There too we are required to look for the most\naccurate description of the efficient cause, which is to be identified\nwith the art of bronze-casting a statue rather than the artisan. It is\npossible to build on both examples to conclude that Aristotle is\nconcerned not only with finding the relevant kinds of causes but also\nwith giving the most accurate description of those causes. By his\nlights, it is only the most accurate description of all the relevant\ncauses that gives us the full explanation, and thereby scientific\nknowledge, of something.\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe study of nature was a search for answers to why-questions before\nand independently of Aristotle. A critical examination of the language\nof causality used by his predecessors, together with a careful study\nof natural phenomena, led Aristotle to elaborate a theory of\ncausality. This theory is presented in its most general form in\nPhysics II 3 and in Metaphysics V 2. In both texts,\nAristotle argues that a final, formal, efficient or material cause can\nbe given in answer to a why-question.\n\nAristotle further elaborates on the topic of causality in the rest of\nPhysics II and in Parts of Animals I. Aristotle\nexplores the systematic interrelations among the four modes of\ncausality and argues for the explanatory priority of the final cause.\nIn so doing Aristotle not only expands on his theory of causality; he\nalso builds explanatory principles that are specific to the study of\nnature. Aristotle considers these principles an indispensable\ntheoretical framework for a successful investigation of the natural\nworld. Both Physics II and Parts of Animals I have a\nfoundational character. More directly, Aristotle expects the student\nof nature to have mastered the principles advanced in these two texts\nbefore engaging in the investigation of the natural world.\n\nAlthough Aristotle\u2019s theory of causality is developed in the\ncontext of his science of nature, its application goes well beyond the\nboundaries of natural science. This is already clear from the most\ngeneral presentation of the theory in Physics II 3 and in\nMetaphysics V 2. Here the four causes are used to explain\nhuman action as well as artistic production. In addition, any\ntheoretical investigation that there might be besides natural science\nwill employ the doctrine of the four causes. \n\nConsider, briefly, the case of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics.\nHere Aristotle is seeking wisdom. Part of the argument of the\nMetaphysics is in an attempt to clarify what sort of wisdom\nAristotle is seeking. Suffice it to say that Aristotle conceives of\nthis wisdom as a science of substance that is, or is a part of, a\nscience of being qua being (for further information about this\nargument, see the entry Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, especially\nSections 1 and 3.) What is important is that this science consists in\na causal investigation, that is, a search for the relevant causes.\nThis helps us to understand why the most general presentation of\nAristotle\u2019s theory of causality is repeated, in almost the same\nwords, in Physics II 3 and in Metaphysics V 2.\nAlthough the Physics and the Metaphysics belong to\ntwo different theoretical enterprises, in both cases we are expected\nto embark on an investigation that will eventuate in causal knowledge,\nand this is not possible without a firm grasp of the interrelations\nbetween the four (types of) causes.\n8.
