In particular, does a group-centered conception of moral\nknowledge that is based on social interactive reasoning help to\naddress the six main clusters of problems raised earlier about the\npossibility of moral knowledge? My answer is positive but\nqualified. Consider the clusters of problems in order.\n\n\nThe first cluster concerns the sociological reality of moral\ndisagreement. Obviously the group-centered conception of moral\nknowledge does not eliminate differences in moral outlook, but it may\nalter how we should think about these differences. I said early on\nthat I would assume that we have knowledge of some non-moral\ntruths. An example would be knowledge that the Earth is round rather\nthan flat. There are pockets of people who still believe that the\nEarth is flat. Should most remain confident in knowing that the Earth\nis round? The reason they should is the social interactive reasoning\nabout the issue over centuries from diverse perspectives leading to\nnear universal agreement. Can a similar conclusion be drawn in certain\nimportant cases of moral agreement, for example, about moral\nprogress?\n\n\nAllen Buchanan and Russell Powell (2018) cite ten examples of moral\nprogress. Among them are these four: \u201c\u2026the large reduction,\nbeginning with the British abolition, of the incidence of the most\nextreme forms of slavery\u2026the increasing recognition and\ninstitutionalization of the equal rights of women in some countries,\nbetter treatment of some non-human animals, abolition of at least the\ncruellest punishments\u201d (p. 47). While not everyone would agree even\nwith these examples, there exists, parallel to the non-moral case,\nextremely broad agreement among diverse groups who have reasoned\nfreely and interactively over extended periods. As Buchanan and Powell\nmake clear, moral progress in such cases goes hand in hand with moral\nregress in many areas and unresolved deep moral differences about\nother issues. On the other hand, if what is in question is the bare\npossibility of moral knowledge, a positive answer seems warranted.\n\n\nThe second, psychological cluster of problems focuses on the dual\nfunction of moral judgment as motivation and belief. The problem is\nhow a judgment can be both at once. A resolution that we examined is\nthat moral judgment can be a hybrid of the two states. That suggestion\nis much easier to defend for moral knowledge when it is embodied in a\ngroup of individuals who have distinct beliefs and motivations. The\ngroup as a whole is motivated by a collection of internalized moral\nnorms that the group believes to be justified. Even if no mental state\nof an individual in a group performs both functions at once, the group\nas a whole can serve both functions of belief and motivation as they\nare differently embodied in the mental states of its members.\n\n\nThe ontological cluster is a different matter. While the subjective\npart of knowledge shifts from individual judgment to the\ninternalization of norms within the group and a reasoned consensus\nthat the norms are justified, the reality that the knowledge is about\nremains a difficult issue: Is moral truth to be treated as\ntheological, non-natural, or natural? There is, however, a subtle\ndifference. The truth in question is about whether the emotionally\nembodied norms can withstand the scrutiny of the whole group under\nsustained interactive reasoning in light of relevant non-moral\nknowledge. Some will complain that such rendering of the object of\nmoral knowledge is too subjective, since it turns moral knowledge into\na form of group self-knowledge. A similar worry was noted when we\ndiscussed group-based justification (Copp 1995) and pragmatic\nnaturalism (Kitcher 2011). We should concede that such worries need to\nbe answered.\n\n\nThe fourth, fifth, and sixth clusters concerning evolutionary,\nmethodological, and moral problems are easier to address, since the\nnew understanding of moral knowledge is based on (a) current knowledge\nof evolution, (b) the methodologies of (i) naturalized epistemology,\n(ii) reflective equilibrium when expanded to include moral consistency\nreasoning (Campbell 2014, 2017), and (iii) pragmatic naturalism, and\n(c) moral concerns raised by feminists. When moral knowledge is\ninterpreted to be consistent with psychological and evolutionary\nstudies of morality, these studies and the methodologies listed tend\nto reinforce the group-centered conception of moral knowledge. Issues\nwill remain, such as the ontological one just noted, but on balance\nthe problems for moral knowledge are diminished. The moral problems of\nbias raised in feminist epistemology are no exception, since the\nfeminist literature cited above emphasizes the social nature of moral\nknowledge. That said, resolution of the bias paradox in feminist\nepistemology may require a realist moral ontology (as noted in section\n6) and it may be unclear how to provide it. Our view that moral\nknowledge is possible is therefore qualified.\n",
