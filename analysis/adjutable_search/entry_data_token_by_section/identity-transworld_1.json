    "main_text": "What is transworld identity? || Transworld identity and conceptions of possible worlds\n1.2 Transworld identity and conceptions of possible worlds\n\nTo say that there is a transworld identity between A and\nB is to say that there is some possible world\nw1, and some distinct possible world\nw2, such that A exists in\nw1, and B exists in\nw2, and A is identical with B.\n(Remember that we are treating the actual world as one of the possible\nworlds.) In other words, to say that there is a transworld identity is\nto say that the same object exists in distinct possible\nworlds, or (more simply) that some object exists in more than one\npossible world.\n\nBut what does it mean to say that an individual exists in a merely\npossible world? And\u2014even if we accept that paraphrases of modal\nstatements in terms of possible worlds are in general\nacceptable\u2014does it even make sense to say that actual\nindividuals (like you and your neighbour\u2019s cat and the Eiffel\nTower) exist in possible worlds other than the actual world? To know\nwhat a claim of transworld identity amounts to, and whether such\nclaims are acceptable, we need to know what a possible world is, and\nwhat it is for an individual to exist in one.\n\nAmong those who take possible worlds seriously (that is, those who\nthink that there are possible worlds, on some appropriate\ninterpretation of the notion), there is a variety of conceptions of\ntheir nature. On one account, that of David Lewis, a non-actual\npossible world is something like another universe, isolated in space\nand time from our own, but containing objects that are just as real as\nthe entities of our world; including its own real concrete objects\nsuch as people, tables, cows, trees, and rivers (but also, perhaps,\nreal concrete unicorns, hobbits, and centaurs). According to Lewis,\nthere is no objective difference in status between what we call\n\u2018the actual world\u2019 and what we call \u2018merely possible\nworlds\u2019. We call our world \u2018actual\u2019 simply because\nwe are in it; the inhabitants of another world may, with equal right,\ncall their world \u2018actual\u2019. In other words,\naccording to Lewis, \u2018actual\u2019 in \u2018the actual\nworld\u2019 is an indexical term (like \u2018here\u2019 or\n\u2018now\u2019), not an indicator of a special ontological status\n(Lewis 1973, 84\u201391; Lewis 1986, Ch. 1).\n\nOn Lewis\u2019s \u2018extreme realist\u2019 account of possible\nworlds, it looks as if, for Clover to exist in another possible world\nas well as the actual world would be for her to be a part of such a\nworld: Clover would somehow have to exist as a (concrete) part of two\nworlds, \u2018in the same way that a shared hand might be a common\npart of two Siamese twins\u2019 (Lewis 1986, 198). But this is\nproblematic. Clover actually has four legs, but could have had three\nlegs. Should we infer that Clover is a part of some world at which she\nhas only three legs? If so, then how many legs does Clover have: four\n(since she actually has four legs), or seven (since she has four in\nour world and three in the alternative world)? Worse still, we appear\nto be ascribing contradictory properties to Clover: she has\nfour legs, and yet has no more than three.\n\nThose who believe in the \u2018extreme realist\u2019 notion of\npossible worlds may respond by thinking of Clover as having a\nfour-legged part in our world, and a three-legged part at some other\nworld. This is Yagisawa\u2019s (2010) view (cf. Lewis 1986,\n210\u2013220). Yagisawa thinks of concrete entities\u2014everyday\nthings such as cats, trees and macbooks\u2014as extended across\npossible worlds (as well as across times and places), in virtue of\nhaving stages (or parts) which exist at those worlds (and\ntimes and places). Ordinary entities thus comprise spatial, temporal\nand modal stages, all of which are equally real. Metaphysically, modal\nstages (and the worlds at which they exist) are on a par with temporal\nand spatial stages (and the times and places at which they exist).\n(This view is the modal analogue of the \u2018perdurance\u2019\naccount of identity over time, according to which an object persists\nthrough time by having \u2018temporal parts\u2019 that are located\nat different times.) Thus, when we say that Clover has four legs in\nour world but only three in some other world, we are saying that she\nhas a four-legged modal stage and a distinct three-legged modal stage.\nClover herself is neither four-legged nor three-legged. (However,\nthere is a sense in which Clover herself\u2014the entity comprising\nmany modal stages\u2014has awfully many legs, even though she\nactually has only four.)\n\nAnother option for the \u2018extreme realist\u2019 about possible\nworlds is to hold that Clover is four-legged relative to our world,\nbut three-legged relative to some other world. In general, qualities\nwe would normally think of as monadic properties are in fact relations\nto worlds. McDaniel (2004) defends a view\u00a0along these lines. A\nfeature of this account is that one and the same entity may exist\naccording to many worlds, for that entity may bear the\nexists-at relation to more than one world. Accordingly, the\nview is sometimes called genuine modal realism with overlap\n(McDaniel 2004). This view, transposed to the temporal case, is\nprecisely what the endurantist says: objects do not have\ntemporal parts; each object is wholly present at each time. (See the\nseparate entry on Temporal Parts.)\n\nLewis rejects both of these options. He rejects the overlap view\nbecause of what he calls \u2018the problem of accidental\nintrinsics\u2019. On the overlap view, having four legs is a\nrelation to a world, and hence not one of Clover\u2019s intrinsic\nproperties. In fact, any aspect of a particular that changes across\nworlds turns out to be non-intrinsic to that particular. As a\nconsequence, every particular has all its intrinsic properties\nessentially, which Lewis thinks is unacceptable (1986,\n199\u2013209).\n\nLewis himself combines his brand of realism about possible worlds with\na denial of transworld identities. According to Lewis, instead of\nsaying that George Eliot (in whole or in part) inhabits more than one\nworld, we should say that she inhabits one world only (ours), but has\ncounterparts in other worlds. And it is the existence of counterparts\nof George Eliot who go in for a career in science rather than novel\nwriting that makes it true that she could have been a scientist rather\nthan a novelist (Lewis 1973, 39\u201343; 1968; 1986, Ch. 4).\n\nHowever, Lewis\u2019s version of realism is by no means the only\nconception of possible worlds. According to an influential set of\nrival accounts, possible worlds, although real entities, are not\nconcrete \u2018other universes\u2019, as in Lewis\u2019s theory,\nbut abstract objects such as (maximal) possible states of affairs or\n\u2018ways the world might have been\u2019. (See Plantinga 1974;\nStalnaker 1976; van Inwagen 1985; Divers 2002; Melia 2003; Stalnaker\n1995; also the separate entry on Possible Worlds. A state of affairs\nS is \u2018maximal\u2019 just in case, for any state of\naffairs S*, either it is impossible for both S and\nS* to obtain, or it is impossible for S to obtain\nwithout S*: the point of the restriction to the maximal is\njust that a possible world should be a possible state of affairs that\nis, in a relevant sense, complete.)\n\nOn the face of it, to treat possible worlds as abstract entities may\nseem only to make the problem of transworld identity worse. If it is\nhard to believe that you (or a table or a cat) could be part of\nanother Lewisian possible world, it seems yet harder to believe that a\nconcrete entity like you (or the table or cat) could be part of an\nabstract entity. However, those who think that possible\nworlds are abstract entities typically do not take the existence in a\nmerely possible world of a concrete actual individual to involve that\nentity\u2019s being literally a part of such an abstract thing.\nRather, such a theorist will propose a different interpretation of\n\u2018existence in\u2019 such a world. For example, according to\nPlantinga\u2019s (1973, 1974) version of this account, to say that\nGeorge Eliot exists in some possible world in which she is a scientist\nis just to say that there is a (maximal) possible state of affairs\nsuch that, had it obtained (i.e., had it been actual), George Eliot\nwould (still) have existed, but would have been a scientist. On this\n(deflationary) account of existence in a possible world, it appears\nthat the difficulties that accompany the idea that George Eliot leads\na double life as an element of another concrete universe as well as\nour own (or the idea that she is partially present in many such\nuniverses) are entirely avoided. On Plantinga\u2019s account, to\nclaim that an actual object exists in another possible world with\nsomewhat different properties amounts to nothing more risqu\u00e9\nthan the claim that the object could have had somewhat different\nproperties: something that few will deny. (Note that according to this\naccount, if the actual world is to be one of the possible worlds, then\nthe actual world must be an abstract entity. So, for example, if a\nmerely possible world is \u2018a way the world might have\nbeen\u2019, the actual world will be \u2018the way the world\nis\u2019; if a merely possible world is a maximal possible state of\naffairs that is not instantiated, then the actual world will be a\nmaximal possible state of affairs that is instantiated. It\nfollows that we must distinguish the actual world qua\nabstract entity from \u2018the actual world\u2019 in the sense of\nthe collection of spatiotemporally linked entities including you and\nyour surroundings that constitutes \u2018the universe\u2019 or\n\u2018the cosmos\u2019. The sense in which you exist in this\nconcrete universe (by being part of it) must be different from the\nsense in which you exist in the abstract state of affairs that is in\nfact instantiated (cf. Stalnaker 1976; van Inwagen 1985, note 3;\nKripke 1980, 19\u201320).)\n\nThe discussion so far may suggest that whether the notion of\ntransworld identity (that an object exists in more than one world) is\nproblematic depends solely on whether one adopts an account of\npossible worlds as concrete entities such as Lewis\u2019s (in which\ncase it is) or an account of possible worlds as abstract entities such\nas Plantinga\u2019s (in which case it is not). However, matters are\nnot so simple, for a variety of reasons (to be discussed in Sections\n3\u20135 below).\n",
