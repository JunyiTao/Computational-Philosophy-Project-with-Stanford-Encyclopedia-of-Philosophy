Sensation in the Essay\n\nMost early modern philosophers were impressed by the facts of\ngeometrical optics, which teach that light imprints an inverted,\nleft-right reversed image of the external world on the concave surface\nof the back of the eye. If we accept that the eye is the means of\nvisual perception, then this teaching appears to imply that the eyes\nfilter out information about the distance at which objects are set\noutwards from us and transmit just information about position along\nthe horizon and the azimuth to the mind. After all, while points at\ndifferent angles of inclination upwards or downwards from the horizon,\nor at different compass directions will project light to different\nparts of the retina, points that differ only with reference to their\ndistance outwards from the eye will project light onto the same part\nof the eye. But if differences in distance outwards make no difference\nto the impression on the eye, and the mind is only affected as a\nconsequence of how the eye is affected, then information about outward\ndistances is not conveyed to the mind. It would seem, therefore, that\nvisual perception must originally lack information about distance\noutwards. It must consist of an awareness of images that are only\ntwo-dimensional projections of solid objects in a three dimensional\nspace. \n\nBut the Condillac of the Essay was not impressed by these\nconsiderations. Though he admitted that the image imprinted by light\non the eye is merely two-dimensional, he denied that the mind must\ntherefore only be aware of a two-dimensional image (Essay\nI.vi \u00a72). However he had little to say about how the mind might\nacquire information about outward distances, and instead confined\nhimself to attacking the standard\n account.[2]\n On the standard account, when I perceive a three dimensional object,\nsuch as a uniformly coloured globe, I must really see a two\ndimensional projection of that object, variously shaded in its\ndifferent parts, and then judge that this two-dimensional, variously\ncoloured image is a representation of a uniformly coloured\nthree-dimensional object (the classic presentation of this view is to\nbe found in Locke\u2019s Essay, book II, chapter ix,\nparagraph 8). But I am not conscious of seeing a flat, variously\ncoloured circle, nor am I conscious of making a judgment about what\nthis image represents. Instead, I seem to immediately see a uniformly\ncoloured, three-dimensional object. Moreover, try as I might, I cannot\nmake myself aware of drawing an inference. And I have so little\nawareness of the flat, variously coloured circle that I supposedly see\nthat, without the aid of instruction in drawing or painting, I would\nhave no idea that it bears any relation to a uniformly coloured globe.\nCondillac found this insupportable. The mind, he maintained, cannot be\nso deeply ignorant of what it senses or of what it does\n(Essay I.vi \u00a7\u00a73\u20135).\n\nConsistently with the view that we do not need to learn to perceive\ndepth, Condillac maintained that we do not need to learn to perceive\nseparation in any other spatial dimension. Consequently, a previously\nblind person, made to see for the first time, should see colours to be\nextended over all three dimensions. The alternative, in\nCondillac\u2019s view is that the newly sighted person would\nexperience just a \u201cmathematical point\u201d of colour, and he\nrejected this as patently absurd (Essay I.vi.\n\u00a7\u00a712\u201314).\n\nCondillac was aware that these claims had been challenged by such\nempirical studies of recovered vision as were available at the time.\nIn 1728, the English surgeon, William Chesselden, had reported to the\nBritish Royal Society that subjects recovering from operations to\nremove cataracts that had blinded them since birth appeared to need to\nlearn to associate what they saw with tactile experience before they\ncould recognize shapes or objects. Condillac replied to this contrary\nevidence by claiming that it would take some time for newly sighted\nsubjects to learn how to focus the eyes in order to perceive colours\ndistinctly, and so to see their outlines. It would then take time for\nthe subjects to attend to the shapes that distinctly seen colours\nexhibit, since we can expect that at first they would be overwhelmed\nand confused by the variety of information presented by the eyes, much\nlike a person gaining a first glimpse of a Bosch painting. Finally,\neven after they came to see colours as, say, outlining square or round\nshapes, they might still hesitate to assume that simply because an\nobject looks to have a certain shape, that therefore it must be felt\nto have that shape as well. For all of these reasons, time might pass\nand the subject might appear to be learning to associate visual\nexperiences with tangible objects, even though the colours that are\noriginally seen are already extended and shaped in three dimensions\n(Essay I.vi. \u00a716).\n",
