    "main_text": "The Nature of Moral Disagreement || Relativist Accounts\n1.2 Relativist Accounts\n\n\nThe fact that moral realists are cognitivists enables them to\nconstrue moral disagreements as conflicts of belief, but some\ncognitivists may also, just like non-cognitivists, need a conception\nwhich is different from the realist one. Moral realism is associated\nwith the absolutist view that the truth conditions or contents of moral\nsentences and moral convictions remain constant across speakers. For\nexample, the realist Richard Boyd insists that there is \u201ca single\nobjective property which we\u2019re all talking about when we use the\nterm \u2018good\u2019 in moral contexts\u201d (1988, 312). However,\nthere are also cognitivists who are relativists and think that the\ntruth conditions of moral sentences vary, depending for example on the\ncultural or social groups which the speakers or believers belong to\n(see, e.g., Harman 1978 and Wong 1984).\n\n\nA crude version of relativism is the simple type of subjectivism\nwhich holds that to state that an action is right or wrong is to report\nsomething about one\u2019s own attitudes towards it. On such a view, if Jane states that meat-eating\nis wrong while Eric claims that it is permitted, then Jane expresses\nthe belief that she disapproves of meat-eating while Eric expresses the\nbelief that he does not disapprove of it. Since both those beliefs can\nbe true, they are not incompatible. A common objection to subjectivism\nis that it therefore, implausibly, represents paradigm cases of moral\ndisagreement as being merely apparent (Moore 1912, ch. 3), which\nillustrates how facts that have to do with moral disagreement can help\na moral realist.\n\n\nSimilar objections can be raised against other forms of relativism,\nalthough it may be easier for some of them to construe cases of moral\ndisagreement as conflicts of belief than for others. For example, on\none type of relativist view, what a speaker claims by stating that an\nact is right is, roughly, that it is permitted by his or her moral\nstandards. So, if the speaker\u2019s claim is rejected by someone who\nshares those standards, then they do after all have incompatible\nbeliefs (for this point, see Harman 1978; and Lo\u0301pez de Sa 2015).\nDisagreements between persons who do not share standards remain to be\naccounted for, however.\n\n\nIn response to such objections, relativists can dissociate\nthemselves from the conception that a moral disagreement essentially\ninvolves a conflict of belief and instead adopt the non-cognitivist\nview which takes such disagreements to be clashes of conative\nattitudes. They may do so, for example, by assuming that the moral\nstandards of a person consist in such attitudes (see, e.g., Wong 1984;\nDreier 1999; Bjo\u0308rnsson and Finlay 2010 and Marques 2014). That\nwould enable them to describe the situation with Jane and Eric as a\ngenuine moral dispute even if they concede that Jane\u2019s and\nEric\u2019s statements about the morality of meat-eating can both be\ntrue. One might think that a relativist who chooses that path is left\nwith little reason to remain a cognitivist. But there are further forms\nof relativism that allow for other options.\n\n\nSome of those are explored in the debate regarding so-called\nfaultless disagreements (e.g., K\u00f6lbel 2003 and McFarlane 2014, ch.\n6). On a view which is inspired by the more general position known as\n\u201cassessor relativism\u201d, the propositions that constitute the\ncontents of moral beliefs are the same independently of who the\nbeliever is. But the truth-values of those contents nevertheless vary\ndepending on the standards of those who assess them (e.g., K\u00f6lbel\n2004; and Schafer 2012). That view allows its advocates to remain\nfaithful to their relativist inclinations and still construe\nJane\u2019s and Eric\u2019s dispute as concerning one and the same\nproposition which is affirmed by Jane and rejected by Eric. It also\nallows them to claim that, for any spectator of the case, at most one\nof Jane\u2019s and Eric\u2019s statements is true (since both cannot\nbe true relative to the same standards). This leaves them with a\nconception of a moral disagreement which has at least some semblance to\nthe realist one. (For further discussion and criticism of the pertinent\naccount of disagreement, see Dreier 1999; and Franc\u00e9n 2010.)\n\n\nThe fact that different theorists thus ultimately employ different\nideas about what a moral disagreement amounts to may make one suspect\nthat they risk talking past each other when discussing further\nquestions, such as how much disagreement there is and how it is to be\nexplained. However, note that the disputes in question take place at a\nquite theoretical level and are consistent with significant overlap\nregarding what counts as a paradigm case of moral disagreement and\nabout the types of behavior such disagreements typically manifest\nitself in. For example, both realists, non-cognitivists and others can\nagree that moral disagreements are typically accompanied with clashes\nof desires and that they are often causally rooted in conflicts of\nnon-moral belief (for example regarding the consequences of the\nactions). That overlap helps to secure a shared subject matter for\ndiscussions about (e.g.) how much disagreement there is.\n",
