    "main_text": "Revisiting Biological Complexity || Evolutionary Systems Biology\n3.3 Evolutionary Systems Biology\n\nSystems biology is often defined as an approach primarily concerned\nwith functional questions (Boogerd et al. 2007). Evolutionary systems\nbiology (ESB) explicitly seeks to expand this focus through\ninvestigations of the evolutionary dynamics of interacting networks\n(Soyer 2012). ESB aims to put the results of systems biology in a\nproper evolutionary context and also to enhance and extend current\nevolutionary biology. Specifically, ESB aims to develop more detailed\nmodels of genotype-phenotype maps to study causal changes over\nevolutionary time-scales and to enhance the predictive potential of\nevolutionary models. These aims are pursued by combining methods from\nmolecular and evolutionary biology with in silico evolution,\ncomparative genomic analysis, as well as with dynamical modeling of\nnetwork architectures (Bapteste and Papale 2021; Soyer &\nO\u2019Malley 2013).\n\nESB can be considered a meeting ground not only for systems biology\nand evolutionary biology but also for the integrated study of\ndevelopmental phenomena in an evolutionary perspective (O\u2019Malley\net al. 2015). Systems biology complements statistical sequence\nanalysis in population genetics and studies of constraints on\nevolutionary pathways in Evolutionary Developmental biology\n(EvoDevo)\u00a0through in silico modelling of large data-sets\n(Jaeger & Crombach 2012; Kim et al. 2011; see also Brigandt 2015).\nSome projects also draw on synthetic modelling of intracellular\nnetworks to investigate how the evolutionary potential of a lineage is\naffected by specific combinations of mutations (Palmer & Kishony\n2013).\n\nEvolutionary network modeling contributes to conceptual development in\nevolutionary biology, e.g., by throwing new light on discussions on\nthe unit of selection (Bapteste and Papale 2021). Another important\nline of investigation in ESB examines the evolutionary background for\nglobal network architectures, modular structures, and recurring\nnetwork motifs\n (Section 1.1.1;\n see also Krohs 2009). The structures may have arisen due to natural\nselection, but ESB also takes seriously the possibilities that\npatterns can arise as side-effects of genomic evolution and drift, or\nfrom a combination of selective and non-selective factors (Steinacher\n& Soyer 2012). An example of an insight from simulations of\nevolving yeast networks is that hierarchical structures with an\noverabundance of network motifs (feedforward loops) can emerge by\nnon-selective tinkering with promoter regions (Cordero &\nHogeweg 2006). In extended models, the integrated effects of selective\nand non-selective factors can be studied at multiple levels (Hogeweg\n2012). With the emphasis on pattern-generation and the potential for\nfuture evolutionary change, ESB takes up Hugo de Vries\u2019\nchallenge to explain not only the survival of the fittest but\nalso the arrival of the fittest (Wagner 2012, 2014). The hope\nis that evolutionary simulations can extend evolutionary biology by\nproviding a forward-looking account.\n\nEvolutionary biology has traditionally been considered as a historical\ndiscipline that provides explanations without giving predictions. ESB\noffers an opportunity to develop more detailed models of evolving\ngenotype-phenotype relations and to explore whether some evolutionary\npathways are predictable given enough information about the network\nstructures, dynamic states, and environmental conditions. Unlike\nforward engineering in synthetic biology, the aim is not to shape new\ndesigns but to understand the possible trajectories of change under\ndifferent conditions. That is, ESB goes beyond historical accounts in\nexploring the potential for evolvability or innovation\u2014what some\nhave called the \u2018tinkering potential\u2019 of system evolution\n(Koonin & Wolf 2010). Research on evolvability can, however, also\ninform and inspire functional analysis and design in synthetic biology\n(Calvert & Frow 2015; Lewens 2013). Thus, also in this context,\nthe relation between biology and engineering must also be\nreexamined.\n\nThe phenomena of tinkering and contingency in evolution are typically\ntaken to highlight the limitations of engineering approaches\nin biology (Jacob 1977; Lynch 2007). Interestingly, however, some\nsystems biologists and philosophers emphasize that a non-adaptationist\nframework can be reached through further cross-fertilization of\nbiology and engineering (Calcott et al. 2015). ESB and synthetic\nbiology can provide a broader perspective on engineering by\nconsidering how design often operates through modification of existing\nsystems. For instance, there are interesting similarities between\nevolvability in biology and a diachronic\nengineering goal in software engineering, where the aim is to\ndesign systems that can be adapted to serve future functional\nrequests, without having to rewrite the code from scratch (Calcott\n2014; see also Sol\u00e9 and Valverde 2020).\n\nThe ambition to predict evolutionary trajectories, even for simple\norganisms, may turn out to be extremely difficult. But ESB provides\nnew ways to investigate whether evolutionary pathways follow some\nrecognizable dynamical patterns. Simulations of how gene regulatory\nnetworks change over evolutionary time-scales can be coupled to\nexperimental evolution in bacteria or insects. For instance, the\ndevelopment of bacterial antibiotic resistance has been shown to be\nconstrained by interactions between different mutations, which may\nmake evolutionary biology informative also for the development and\ncombination of antibiotics used in medical treatment (Palmer &\nKrishony 2013; Weinreich et al. 2006).\n\nSome proponents expect that ESB will uncover regularities or stable\nevolutionary patterns across various types of networks and species.\nSuch regularities may not resemble universal laws, but the hope is\nthat some general principles underlying evolutionary dynamics can be\nidentified, referred to as \u201claws of evolution\u201d (Koonin\n2011), \u201cevolutionary design principles\u201d (Steinacher &\nSoyer 2012) or \u201cgeneric principles\u201d of evolution (Jaeger\n& Monk 2013). ESB thus offers excellent cases for debating the\npossibility of turning evolutionary biology into a more predictive\nfield with generalizable principles (Lobkovsky & Koonin 2012; Papp\net al. 2011). Moreover, it is a rich field for discussing the\nimplications of an \u2018extended modern synthesis\u2019 that\ncombines molecular, mathematical, computational, synthetic, and\npopulation genetic approaches to evolution (Pigliucci 2007;\nO\u2019Malley et al. 2015).\n",
