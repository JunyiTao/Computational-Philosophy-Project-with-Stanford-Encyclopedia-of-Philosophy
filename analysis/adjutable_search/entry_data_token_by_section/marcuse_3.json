    "main_text": "The Search for a Philosophical Foundation for Marxism and the Radical Subject || Philosophical Anthropology and Radical Subjectivity\n3.2 Philosophical Anthropology and Radical Subjectivity\n\n\nIn 1932 Marcuse published one of the first reviews of the newly\npublished 1844 Manuscripts entitled \u201cNeue Quellen zur\nGrundlegung des historischen Materialismus\u201d (New Sources on the\nFoundation of Historical Materialism). According to Marcuse, the\n1844 Manuscripts had the possibility to accomplish two things.\n\n\nThese manuscripts could put the discussion about the origins and\noriginal meaning of historical materialism, and the entire theory of\n\u201cscientific socialism,\u201d on a new footing. They also\nmake it possible to pose the question of the actual connections between\nMarx and Hegel in a more fruitful way. (Wolin 2001: 86)\n\n\nHowever, these manuscripts also provided Marcuse with the necessary\ntheoretical tools needed for developing a critical, philosophical\nanthropology that would aid him in the development of his own brand of\ncritical theory.\n\nIn this context, \u201canthropology\u201d does not refer to the\nstudy of past cultures, as it often does in the United\nStates. Instead, it refers to the German idea of anthropology which is\nmore of a philosophical and social scientific examination of human\nnature.  The 1844 Manuscripts are important for Marcuse\nbecause in them Marx provides a philosophical foundation for his later\ncritique of political economy as well as an action-theoretic,\nphilosophical anthropology. Philosophical categories such as labor,\nobjectification, alienation, sublation, property, and others all\nexplored in Hegel\u2019s philosophy were scrutinized dialectically by\nMarx (Kellner 1984: 79). \n\nIn a nutshell, what Marcuse sees in the 1844 Manuscripts is\nan analysis of the social conditions for a communist revolution. \nThe revolution itself requires the development of radical\nsubjectivity. Radical subjectivity refers to the development of a\nform of self-consciousness that finds present social and economic\nconditions intolerable. The radical act is a refusal of these\nconditions and an orientation toward social transformation. To make\nsense of Marcuse\u2019s position we must ask: what are these\nintolerable conditions and how are they produced? Philosophical\nanthropology and radical subjectivity are connected here insofar as the\nintolerable conditions that must be overcome by revolution or the\nradical act represent social distortions of the human essence. It\nis Marx and Hegel who provided Marcuse with a philosophical\nanthropology that discloses human essence and the social mechanisms by\nwhich it is distorted. The key category here is that of\n\u201calienation\u201d which cannot be understood without examining\nthe role of labor and objectification.\n\nAccording to Marcuse, Hegel, and Marx, human beings develop through\na self-formative process wherein the external world (nature) is\nappropriated and transformed according to human needs. Labor is\none of the main areas for this self-formative activity. The idea\nthat labor is an essential part of a self-formative process is what\ndistinguishes Marx from the classical economists such as Smith,\nRicardo, etc. In classical economics, labor is simply the means\nby which individuals make provisions for themselves and their\nfamilies. In these theories labor is not viewed as that activity\nby which the human subject is constituted. The Marxian view of\nlabor as a self-formative process is what makes possible the Marxian\ntheory of alienation and revolution.\n\nMarcuse argues that in the 1844 Manuscripts Marx shows how\nthe role of labor as a self-realization or self-formative process gets\ninverted. Instead of having his or her subjectivity affirmed, the\nindividual becomes an object that is now shaped by external, alien\nforces. Hence, Marx\u2019s theory makes a transition from an\nexamination of the self-formative process of labor to a critique of the\nforms of alienation caused by the historical facticity of capitalism.\nWithin the historical facticity of capitalism\n\n\nthis fact appears as the total inversion and concealment of what\ncritique had defined as the essence of man and human labor. Labor is\nnot \u201cfree activity\u201d or the universal and free\nself-realization of man, but his enslavement and loss of reality. The\nworker is not man in the totality of his life-expression, but\nsomething unessential [ein Unwesen], the purely physical\nsubject of \u201cabstract\u201d activity. The objects of labor are\nnot expressions and confirmations of the human reality of the worker,\nbut alien things, belonging to someone other than the\nworker\u2014\u201ccommodities.\u201d (Marcuse 2005b: 104)\n\nMarcuse will spend the rest of his life carrying out the\ninvestigations started in these early works. What distinguishes his\nproject from Marx\u2019s is the way in which each will deal with the\nproblem of concealment mentioned in the above quote. Marx will\ndevelop two different but related approaches. His critique of\npolitical economy is an attempt to disclose the inner logic of\ncapitalism (how it works) as well as the contradictions that will lead\nto the collapse of capitalism. The second approach is to work out\na theory of revolution which presupposes the awakening of\nself-consciousness in the working class. In both approaches\nconcealment will give way to disclosure and social\ntransformation. We saw earlier that Marx\u2019s predictions did\nnot come true on either account. This failure in part led to what\nhas been called the crisis of Marxism to which the birth of the\nFrankfurt School was a response. Marcuse\u2019s work will go\nthrough many phases as he tries to unlock the key to revolutionary\naction. The next key move for him is to engage in a deeper study\nof Hegel as a source for critical social theory.\n",
