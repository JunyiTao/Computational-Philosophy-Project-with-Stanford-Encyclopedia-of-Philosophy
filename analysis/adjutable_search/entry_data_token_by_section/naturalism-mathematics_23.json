Sometimes ontological naturalism is motivated by metaphysical\ndoctrines, for instance by the principle that everything that exists\nhas causal powers. Subscribers to this principle include Armstrong\n(1997) who calls it the Eleatic Principle; for criticism, see Colyvan\n(2001 ch. 3) and Papineau (2009).\n\n\nThe most popular argument for ontological naturalism is\nepistemological, and consequently ontological naturalism is often\nallied with epistemological naturalism. If there are abstract entities\nthen it seems we cannot know nor form reliable beliefs about them\n(Benacerraf 1973, Field 1989), because of their causal isolation from\nus. Most philosophers take this to be the main problem afflicting\nplatonism. Note that the argument typically leads to agnosticism\nrather than denial of abstract mathematical objects' existence. This\nis not the place to engage with the argument\u2014for more details,\nsee Balaguer (2009)\u2014save to sketch how a platonist who is also a\nscientific or mathematical-cum-scientific naturalist\u2014e.g.,\nQuine\u2014responds to it.\n\n\nThe naturalist-platonist response is two-pronged (Burgess and Rosen\n1997, 2005; for criticism, see Linnebo 2006, Chihara 2006). The first\nprong is that no simple criterion for knowledge (or reliable belief or\njustified belief) has ever been devised that succeeds in ruling out\nknowledge of the abstract without thereby ruling out types of knowledge\nmost naturalists would accept (Steiner 1975). A couple of examples: (i)\nthe condition that p is a cause of the belief that p\nis too strong, as it rules out knowledge of the future; (ii) as the\nnaturalist-platonist sees it, that abstract mathematical reality is\nthus-and-so is in fact part of the best explanation for the belief that\np; hence an explanatory condition of this kind turns out to be\ncompatible with platonism. Moreover, naturalist-platonists complain\nthat even if a criterion were found that draws the line where the\nnominalist wishes it to be drawn, it would beg the question against\nplatonism.\n\n\nSecondly, naturalist-platonists run a standard Quinean line by\nconstruing any challenge to the reliability of our beliefs about\nplatonic mathematical objects as a general challenge to the scientific\nmethod's reliability. (This is from the point of view of the\nscientific naturalist; the scientific-cum-mathematical naturalist can\nrun the same line with corresponding adjustments.) However, by our best\nlights\u2014according to our best theory of the world, i.e., natural\nscience, which posits abstract mathematical objects\u2014belief in\nabstract mathematical entities is arrived at by a reliable method,\nnamely the scientific method. This is not simply self-vindication, since the\nscientific method is here being used to explain the reliability of\nmathematical beliefs, albeit holistically. But of course if the\nreliability of the scientific method itself is put into question, the\nnaturalist has no choice but to use the scientific method itself to\nexplain its own reliability. The naturalist-platonist may add that we\ncan do no better, and that anyone who questions the scientific\nmethod's reliability has thereby abandoned the naturalist camp.\nFrom this perspective, then, there is no epistemological problem for\nplatonism once it is settled that platonist mathematics is part of best\nscience.\n",
