    "main_text": "Approaches to AI || The Intelligent Agent Continuum\n3.1 The Intelligent Agent Continuum\n\nAs Russell and Norvig (2009) tell us in the Preface of AIMA:\n\n\nThe main unifying theme is the idea of an intelligent agent. We define\nAI as the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment\nand perform actions. Each such agent implements a function that maps\npercept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent\nthese functions\u2026 (Russell & Norvig 2009, vii)\n\n\nThe basic picture is thus summed up in this figure:\n\n\n\nImpressionistic Overview of an Intelligent Agent\n\n\nThe content of AIMA derives, essentially, from fleshing out\nthis picture; that is, the above figure corresponds to the different\nways of representing the overall function that intelligent agents\nimplement. And there is a progression from the least powerful agents\nup to the more powerful ones. The following figure gives a high-level\nview of a simple kind of agent discussed early in the book. (Though\nsimple, this sort of agent corresponds to the architecture of\nrepresentation-free agents designed and implemented by Rodney Brooks,\n1991.)\n\n\n\nA Simple Reflex Agent\n\n\nAs the book progresses, agents get increasingly sophisticated, and the\nimplementation of the function they represent thus draws from more and\nmore of what AI can currently muster. The following figure gives an\noverview of an agent that is a bit smarter than the simple reflex\nagent. This smarter agent has the ability to internally model the\noutside world, and is therefore not simply at the mercy of what can at\nthe moment be directly sensed.\n\n\n\nA More Sophisticated Reflex Agent\n\n\nThere are seven parts to AIMA. As the reader passes through\nthese parts, she is introduced to agents that take on the powers\ndiscussed in each part. Part I is an introduction to the agent-based\nview. Part II is concerned with giving an intelligent agent the\ncapacity to think ahead a few steps in clearly defined environments.\nExamples here include agents able to successfully play games of\nperfect information, such as chess. Part III deals with agents that\nhave declarative knowledge and can reason in ways that will be quite\nfamiliar to most philosophers and logicians (e.g., knowledge-based\nagents deduce what actions should be taken to secure their goals).\nPart IV of the book outfits agents with the power to handle\nuncertainty by reasoning in probabilistic\n fashion.[19]\n In Part V, agents are given a capacity to learn. The following figure\nshows the overall structure of a learning agent.\n\n\n\nA Learning Agent\n\n\nThe final set of powers agents are given allow them to communicate.\nThese powers are covered in Part VI. \n\nPhilosophers who patiently travel the entire progression of\nincreasingly smart agents will no doubt ask, when reaching the end of\nPart VII, if anything is missing. Are we given enough, in general, to\nbuild an artificial person, or is there enough only to build a mere\nanimal? This question is implicit in the following from Charniak and\nMcDermott (1985): \n\nThe ultimate goal of AI (which we are very far from achieving) is to\nbuild a person, or, more humbly, an animal. (Charniak & McDermott\n1985, 7)\n\n\nTo their credit, Russell & Norvig, in AIMA\u2019s Chapter\n27, \u201cAI: Present and Future,\u201d consider this question, at\nleast to some\n degree.[]\n They do so by considering some challenges to AI that have hitherto\nnot been met. One of these challenges is described by R&N as\nfollows: \n\n[M]achine learning has made very little progress on the important\nproblem of constructing new representations at levels of abstraction\nhigher than the input vocabulary. In computer vision, for example,\nlearning complex concepts such as Classroom and Cafeteria would be\nmade unnecessarily difficult if the agent were forced to work from\npixels as the input representation; instead, the agent needs to be\nable to form intermediate concepts first, such as Desk and Tray,\nwithout explicit human supervision. Similar concepts apply to learning\nbehavior: HavingACupOfTea is a very important high-level step\nin many plans, but how does it get into an action library that\ninitially contains much simpler actions such as RaiseArm and Swallow?\nPerhaps this will incorporate deep belief networks \u2013\nBayesian networks that have multiple layers of hidden variables, as in\nthe work of Hinton et al. (2006), Hawkins and Blakeslee (2004),\nand Bengio and LeCun (2007). \u2026 Unless we understand such\nissues, we are faced with the daunting task of constructing large\ncommonsense knowledge bases by hand, and approach that has not fared\nwell to date. (Russell & Norvig 2009, Ch. 27.1)\n\n\nWhile there has seen some advances in addressing this challenge (in\nthe form of deep learning or representation learning),\nthis specific challenge is actually merely a foothill before a range\nof dizzyingly high mountains that AI must eventually somehow manage to\nclimb. One of those mountains, put simply, is\n reading.[21]\n Despite the fact that, as noted, Part V of AIMA is devoted to\nmachine learning, AI, as it stands, offers next to nothing in the way\nof a mechanization of learning by reading. Yet when you think about\nit, reading is probably the dominant way you learn at this stage in\nyour life. Consider what you\u2019re doing at this very moment.\nIt\u2019s a good bet that you are reading this sentence because,\nearlier, you set yourself the goal of learning about the field of AI.\n Yet\n the formal models of learning provided in AIMA\u2019s Part IV\n(which are all and only the models at play in AI) cannot be applied to\nlearning by\n reading.[22]\n These models all start with a function-based view of learning.\nAccording to this view, to learn is almost invariably to produce an\nunderlying function \\(\\ff\\) on the basis of a restricted set of\npairs \n\n\\[\n \\left\\{\\left\\langle x_1, \\ff(x_1)\\right\\rangle,\\left\\langle x_2, \\ff(x_2)\\right\\rangle, \\ldots, \\left\\langle x_n, \\ff(x_n)\\right\\rangle\\right\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nFor example, consider receiving inputs consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, and\n5, and corresponding range values of 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25; the goal is\nto \u201clearn\u201d the underlying mapping from natural numbers to\nnatural numbers. In this case, assume that the underlying function is\n\\(n^2\\), and that you do \u201clearn\u201d it. While this narrow\nmodel of learning can be productively applied to a number of\nprocesses, the process of reading isn\u2019t one of them. Learning by\nreading cannot (at least for the foreseeable future) be modeled as\ndivining a function that produces argument-value pairs. Instead, your\nreading about AI can pay dividends only if your knowledge has\nincreased in the right way, and if that knowledge leaves you\npoised to be able to produce behavior taken to confirm sufficient\nmastery of the subject area in question. This behavior can range from\ncorrectly answering and justifying test questions regarding AI, to\nproducing a robust, compelling presentation or paper that signals your\nachievement. \n\nTwo points deserve to be made about machine reading. First, it may not\nbe clear to all readers that reading is an ability that is central to\nintelligence. The centrality derives from the fact that intelligence\nrequires vast knowledge. We have no other means of getting systematic\nknowledge into a system than to get it in from text, whether text on\nthe web, text in libraries, newspapers, and so on. You might even say\nthat the big problem with AI has been that machines really don\u2019t\nknow much compared to humans. That can only be because of the fact\nthat humans read (or hear: illiterate people can listen to text being\nuttered and learn that way). Either machines gain knowledge by humans\nmanually encoding and inserting knowledge, or by reading and\nlistening. These are brute facts. (We leave aside supernatural\ntechniques, of course. Oddly enough, Turing didn\u2019t: he seemed to\nthink ESP should be discussed in connection with the powers of minds\nand machines. See Turing,\n 1950.)[23]\n\nNow for the second point. Humans able to read have invariably also\nlearned a language, and learning languages has been modeled in\nconformity to the function-based approach adumbrated just above\n(Osherson et al. 1986). However, this doesn\u2019t entail that an\nartificial agent able to read, at least to a significant degree, must\nhave really and truly learned a natural language. AI is first and\nforemost concerned with engineering computational artifacts that\nmeasure up to some test (where, yes, sometimes that test is from the\nhuman sphere), not with whether these artifacts process information in\nways that match those present in the human case. It may or may not be\nnecessary, when engineering a machine that can read, to imbue that\nmachine with human-level linguistic competence. The issue is\nempirical, and as time unfolds, and the engineering is pursued, we\nshall no doubt see the issue settled. \n\nTwo additional high mountains facing AI are subjective consciousness\nand creativity, yet it would seem that these great challenges are ones\nthe field apparently hasn\u2019t even come to grips with. Mental\nphenomena of paramount importance to many philosophers of mind and\nneuroscience are simply missing from AIMA. For example,\nconsciousness is only mentioned in passing in AIMA, but\nsubjective consciousness is the most important thing in our lives\n\u2013 indeed we only desire to go on living because we wish to go on\nenjoying subjective states of certain types. Moreover, if human minds\nare the product of evolution, then presumably phenomenal consciousness\nhas great survival value, and would be of tremendous help to a robot\nintended to have at least the behavioral repertoire of the first\ncreatures with brains that match our own (hunter-gatherers; see Pinker\n1997). Of course, subjective consciousness is largely missing from the\nsister fields of cognitive psychology and computational cognitive\nmodeling as well. We discuss some of these challenges in the\n Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence\n section below. For a list of similar challenges to cognitive science,\nsee the relevant\n section of the entry on cognitive science.[24]\n\n\nTo some readers, it might seem in the very least tendentious to point\nto subjective consciousness as a major challenge to AI that it has yet\nto address. These readers might be of the view that pointing to this\nproblem is to look at AI through a distinctively philosophical prism,\nand indeed a controversial philosophical standpoint. \n\nBut as its literature makes clear, AI measures itself by looking to\nanimals and humans and picking out in them remarkable mental powers,\nand by then seeing if these powers can be mechanized. Arguably the\npower most important to humans (the capacity to experience) is nowhere\nto be found on the target list of most AI researchers. There may be a\ngood reason for this (no formalism is at hand, perhaps), but there is\nno denying the state of affairs in question obtains, and that, in\nlight of how AI measures itself, that it\u2019s worrisome. \n\nAs to creativity, it\u2019s quite remarkable that the power we most\npraise in human minds is nowhere to be found in AIMA. Just as\nin (Charniak & McDermott 1985) one cannot find\n\u2018neural\u2019 in the index, \u2018creativity\u2019\ncan\u2019t be found in the index of AIMA. This is particularly\nodd because many AI researchers have in fact worked on creativity\n(especially those coming out of philosophy; e.g., Boden 1994,\nBringsjord & Ferrucci 2000). \n\nAlthough the focus has been on AIMA, any of its counterparts\ncould have been used. As an example, consider Artificial\nIntelligence: A New Synthesis, by Nils Nilsson. As in the case of\nAIMA, everything here revolves around a gradual progression\nfrom the simplest of agents (in Nilsson\u2019s case, reactive\nagents), to ones having more and more of those powers that\ndistinguish persons. Energetic readers can verify that there is a\nstriking parallel between the main sections of Nilsson\u2019s book\nand AIMA. In addition, Nilsson, like Russell and Norvig,\nignores phenomenal consciousness, reading, and creativity. None of the\nthree are even mentioned. Likewise, a recent comprehensive AI textbook\nby Luger (2008) follows the same pattern. \n\nA final point to wrap up this section. It seems quite plausible to\nhold that there is a certain inevitability to the structure of an AI\ntextbook, and the apparent reason is perhaps rather interesting. In\npersonal conversation, Jim Hendler, a well-known AI researcher who is\none of the main innovators behind Semantic Web (Berners-Lee, Hendler,\nLassila 2001), an under-development \u201cAI-ready\u201d version of\nthe World Wide Web, has said that this inevitability can be rather\neasily displayed when teaching Introduction to AI; here\u2019s how.\nBegin by asking students what they think AI is. Invariably, many\nstudents will volunteer that AI is the field devoted to building\nartificial creatures that are intelligent. Next, ask for examples of\nintelligent creatures. Students always respond by giving examples\nacross a continuum: simple multi-cellular organisms, insects, rodents,\nlower mammals, higher mammals (culminating in the great apes), and\nfinally human persons. When students are asked to describe the\ndifferences between the creatures they have cited, they end up\nessentially describing the progression from simple agents to ones\nhaving our (e.g.) communicative powers. This progression gives the\nskeleton of every comprehensive AI textbook. Why does this happen? The\nanswer seems clear: it happens because we can\u2019t resist\nconceiving of AI in terms of the powers of extant creatures with which\nwe are familiar. At least at present, persons, and the creatures who\nenjoy only bits and pieces of personhood, are \u2013 to repeat\n\u2013 the measure of\n AI.[25]\n\n",
