    "main_text": "\n\nThe concept of race has historically signified the division of\nhumanity into a small number of groups based upon five criteria: (1)\nRaces reflect some type of biological foundation, be it Aristotelian\nessences or modern genes; (2) This biological foundation generates\ndiscrete racial groupings, such that all and only all members of one\nrace share a set of biological characteristics that are not shared by\nmembers of other races; (3) This biological foundation is inherited\nfrom generation to generation, allowing observers to identify an\nindividual\u2019s race through her ancestry or genealogy; (4)\nGenealogical investigation should identify each race\u2019s\ngeographic origin, typically in Africa, Europe, Asia, or North and\nSouth America; and (5) This inherited racial biological foundation\nmanifests itself primarily in physical phenotypes, such as skin color,\neye shape, hair texture, and bone structure, and perhaps also\nbehavioral phenotypes, such as intelligence or delinquency.\n\nThis historical concept of race has faced substantial scientific and\nphilosophical challenge, with some important thinkers denying both the\nlogical coherence of the concept and the very existence of races.\nOthers defend the concept of race, albeit with substantial changes to\nthe foundations of racial identity, which they depict as either\nsocially constructed or, if biologically grounded, neither discrete\nnor essentialist, as the historical concept would have it.\n\nBoth in the past and today, determining the boundaries of discrete\nraces has proven to be most vexing and has led to great variations in\nthe number of human races believed to be in existence. Thus, some\nthinkers categorized humans into only four distinct races (typically\nwhite or Caucasian, Black or African, yellow or Asian, and red or\nNative American), and downplayed any biological or phenotypical\ndistinctions within racial groups (such as those between Scandinavians\nand Spaniards within the white or Caucasian race). Other thinkers\nclassified humans into many more racial categories, for instance\narguing that those humans \u201cindigenous\u201d to Europe could be\ndistinguished into discrete Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean\nraces.\n\nThe ambiguities and confusion associated with determining the\nboundaries of racial categories have led to the widespread position\nthat discrete or essentialist races are socially constructed, not\nbiologically real. However, significant scholarly debate persists\nregarding whether reproductive isolation, either during human\nevolution or through modern practices barring miscegenation, may have\ngenerated sufficient genetic isolation as to justify using the term\nrace to signify the existence of non-discrete human groups that share\nnot only physical phenotypes but also clusters of genetic material. In\naddition, scholarly debate exists concerning the formation and\ncharacter of socially constructed, discrete racial categories. For\ninstance, some scholars suggest that race is inconceivable without\nracialized social hierarchies, while others argue that egalitarian\nrace relations are possible. Finally, substantial controversy\nsurrounds the moral status of racial identity and solidarity and the\njustice and legitimacy of policies or institutions aimed at\nundermining racial inequality.\n\nThis entry focuses primarily on contemporary scholarship regarding the\nconceptual, ontological, epistemological, and normative questions\npertaining to race, with an introductory section on the history of the\nconcept of race in the West and in Western philosophy. Aside from some\ndiscussion in Section 5, it does not focus in depth on authors such as\nFrederick Douglass, W.E.B. DuBois, or Frantz Fanon, or movements, such\nas N\u00e9gritude, Critical Race Theory, Black Identity, Philosophy\nof Liberation, or Feminist Perspectives on Race. Interested readers\nshould consult the relevant entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy for insight into these and other topics important to the\nstudy of race in philosophy.\n\nIn Section 1, we trace the historical origins and development of the\nconcept of race. Section 2 covers contemporary philosophical debates\nover whether races actually exist. Thereafter, in Section 3 we examine\nthe differences between race and ethnicity. Section 4 surveys debates\namong moral, political and legal philosophers over the validity of\nracial identity, racial solidarity, and race-specific policies such as\naffirmative action and race-based representation. Section 5 outlines\nengagement with the concept of race within Continental philosophy.\n",
