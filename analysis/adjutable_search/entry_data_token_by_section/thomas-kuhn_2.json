    "main_text": "The Concept of a Paradigm\n3. The Concept of a Paradigm\nA mature science, according to Kuhn, experiences alternating phases\nof normal science and revolutions. In normal science the key theories,\ninstruments, values and metaphysical assumptions that comprise the\ndisciplinary matrix are kept fixed, permitting the cumulative\ngeneration of puzzle-solutions, whereas in a scientific revolution the\ndisciplinary matrix undergoes revision, in order to permit the\nsolution of the more serious anomalous puzzles that disturbed the\npreceding period of normal science.\nA particularly important part of Kuhn\u2019s thesis in The Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions focuses upon one specific component of\nthe disciplinary matrix. This is the consensus on exemplary instances\nof scientific research. These exemplars of good science are what Kuhn\nrefers to when he uses the term \u2018paradigm\u2019 in a narrower\nsense.  He cites Aristotle\u2019s analysis of motion, Ptolemy\u2019s\ncomputations of plantery positions, Lavoisier\u2019s application of the\nbalance, and Maxwell\u2019s mathematization of the electromagnetic field as\nparadigms (1962/1970a, 23). Exemplary instances of science are\ntypically to be found in books and papers, and so Kuhn often also\ndescribes great texts as paradigms\u2014Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest,\nLavoisier\u2019s Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de\nchimie, and Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica and\nOpticks (1962/1970a, 12).  Such texts contain not only the\nkey theories and laws, but also\u2014and this is what makes them\nparadigms\u2014the applications of those theories in the solution of\nimportant problems, along with the new experimental or mathematical\ntechniques (such as the chemical balance in Trait\u00e9\n\u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de chimie and the calculus in\nPrincipia Mathematica) employed in those applications.\nIn the postscript to the second edition of The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions Kuhn says of paradigms in this sense that\nthey are \u201cthe most novel and least understood aspect of this\nbook\u201d (1962/1970a, 187). The claim that the consensus of a\ndisciplinary matrix is primarily agreement on paradigms-as-exemplars\nis intended to explain the nature of normal science and the process of\ncrisis, revolution, and renewal of normal science. It also explains\nthe birth of a mature science. Kuhn describes an immature science, in\nwhat he sometimes calls its \u2018pre-paradigm\u2019 period, as\nlacking consensus. Competing schools of thought possess differing\nprocedures, theories, even metaphysical presuppositions. Consequently\nthere is little opportunity for collective progress. Even localized\nprogress by a particular school is made difficult, since much\nintellectual energy is put into arguing over the fundamentals with\nother schools instead of developing a research tradition. However,\nprogress is not impossible, and one school may make a breakthrough\nwhereby the shared problems of the competing schools are solved in a\nparticularly impressive fashion. This success draws away adherents\nfrom the other schools, and a widespread consensus is formed around\nthe new puzzle-solutions.\nThis widespread consensus now permits agreement on\nfundamentals. For a problem-solution will embody particular theories,\nprocedures and instrumentation, scientific language, metaphysics, and\nso forth. Consensus on the puzzle-solution will thus bring consensus\non these other aspects of a disciplinary matrix also. The successful\npuzzle-solution, now a paradigm puzzle-solution, will not solve all\nproblems. Indeed, it will probably raise new puzzles. For example, the\ntheories it employs may involve a constant whose value is not known\nwith precision; the paradigm puzzle-solution may employ approximations\nthat could be improved; it may suggest other puzzles of the same kind;\nit may suggest new areas for investigation. Generating new puzzles is\none thing that the paradigm puzzle-solution does; helping solve them\nis another. In the most favourable scenario, the new puzzles raised by the paradigm\npuzzle-solution can be addressed and answered using precisely the\ntechniques that the paradigm puzzle-solution employs. And since the\nparadigm puzzle-solution is accepted as a great achievement, these\nvery similar puzzle-solutions will be accepted as successful solutions\nalso. This is why Kuhn uses the terms \u2018exemplar\u2019 and\n\u2018paradigm\u2019. For the novel puzzle-solution which\ncrystallizes consensus is regarded and used as a model of exemplary\nscience. In the research tradition it inaugurates, a\nparadigm-as-exemplar fulfils three functions: (i) it suggests new\npuzzles; (ii) it suggests approaches to solving those puzzles; (iii)\nit is the standard by which the quality of a proposed puzzle-solution\ncan be measured (1962/1970a, 38\u20139). In each case it is similarity to\nthe exemplar that is the scientists\u2019 guide.\nThat normal science proceeds on the basis of perceived similarity\nto exemplars is an important and distinctive feature of Kuhn\u2019s new\npicture of scientific development. The standard view explained the\ncumulative addition of new knowledge in terms of the application of\nthe scientific method. Allegedly, the scientific method encapsulates\nthe rules of scientific rationality. It may be that those rules could\nnot account for the creative side of science\u2014the generation of\nnew hypotheses. The latter was thus designated \u2018the context of\ndiscovery\u2019, leaving the rules of rationality to decide in the\n\u2018context of justification\u2019 whether a new hypothesis should,\nin the light of the evidence, be added to the stock of accepted\ntheories. \nKuhn rejected the distinction between the context of discovery and\nthe context of justification (1962/1970a, 8), and correspondingly\nrejected the standard account of each. As regards the context of\ndiscovery, the standard view held that the philosophy of science had\nnothing to say on the issue of the functioning of the creative\nimagination. But Kuhn\u2019s paradigms do provide a partial explanation,\nsince training with exemplars enables scientists to see new\npuzzle-situations in terms of familiar puzzles and hence enables them\nto see potential solutions to their new puzzles. \nMore important for Kuhn was the way his account of the context of\njustification diverged from the standard picture. The functioning of\nexemplars is intended explicitly to contrast with the operation of\nrules. The key determinant in the acceptability of a proposed\npuzzle-solution is its similarity to the paradigmatic\npuzzle-solutions. Perception of similarity cannot be reduced to rules,\nand a fortiori cannot be reduced to rules of rationality. This\nrejection of rules of rationality was one of the factors that led\nKuhn\u2019s critics to accuse him of irrationalism\u2014regarding science\nas irrational. In this respect at least the accusation is wide of the\nmark. For to deny that some cognitive process is the outcome of\napplying rules of rationality is not to imply that it is an irrational\nprocess: the perception of similarity in appearance between two\nmembers of the same family also cannot be reduced to the application\nof rules of rationality. Kuhn\u2019s innovation in The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions was to suggest that a key element in\ncognition in science operates in the same fashion.\n",
