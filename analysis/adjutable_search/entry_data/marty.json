    "preamble": "\n\nAnton Marty (October 18, 1847\u2013October 1, 1914) was a philosopher\nof language, psychologist, and ontologist.

His oldest\nbrother went into the priesthood and became a missionary to the Sioux\nin North America. Though Marty himself was ordained, he left the\npriesthood shortly after Brentano had done so (in 1873, a few years\nafter the declaration of papal infallibility) and pursued an academic\ncareer instead.

    "main_text": "\n1. Marty as a Follower of Brentano\n\nMarty\u2019s career can be best viewed from the perspective of his\nrelationship to Brentano. Already in 1867, before Marty began to study\nat a university, he had written a prize winning essay \u201cSt.\nThomas\u2019 Doctrine of Abstraction of Supersensory Ideas from\nSensory Images, with an Exposition and Critique of Other Theories of\nKnowledge\u201d, in which he cited Brentano\u2019s recently\npublished works on Aristotle (Brentano 1862 and Brentano 1867). He was\nso inspired by these works that he requested permission from his\nbishop to study in W\u00fcrzburg, where Brentano, also at the time a\nCatholic priest, had just been appointed lecturer after triumphantly\nengaging in a formal disputation with a disciple of Schelling. One of\nthe theses that Brentano defended in this disputation was: \u201cThe\ntrue method of philosophy is none other than that of the natural\nsciences\u201d (Brentano, [ed.] Kraus 1929, 147). In the autumn of\n1868 Marty began attending Brentano\u2019s lectures in which this\nthesis was applied to various areas of philosophy. He and Carl Stumpf,\nwho had already been studying in W\u00fcrzburg, became friends with\neach other and disciples of Brentano in the renewal of philosophy and\nreligion (Stumpf 1919, 88 ff.). In such a renewal all the speculative\nexcesses of German Idealism from earlier in the century had to be\npurged and replaced with rigor and clarity of thought, not to mention\na relentless adherence to the empirical source of knowledge.\n\nIn 1869 Marty became a teacher in a secondary school in his home town\nand received higher orders the next year, though he continued to stay\nin contact with Brentano. Marty was hardly aware, however, that\nBrentano was having misgivings about his Catholic faith, especially in\nthe light of the doctrine of infallibility that was declared in 1870.\nThough Brentano became a professor in W\u00fcrzburg in 1872, he\nresigned from this position and left the church in the following year.\nBoth Stumpf and Marty were soon to follow him in abandoning their\npursuit of a profession as clergymen. This was not as damaging to\nStumpf, who had never been ordained, as it was to Marty. As a\nconsequence, he never married in order to avoid disappointing his\nfamily more than he already had done. His circumstances thus allowed\nhim little choice but to pursue an academic career, as he did by\nreceiving a doctorate in G\u00f6ttingen with Rudolf Hermann Lotze as\nhis dissertation advisor (as Stumpf had also done). An expanded\nversion of the resulting work (Marty 1875) was subsequently published\nand he took a position at the newly established university in\nCzernowitz.\n\nBrentano in the meantime had become a professor in 1874 in Vienna,\nwhere he continued to develop his philosophical views in the same\nspirit as he did in W\u00fcrzburg, with no other method but that of\nthe natural sciences. An important distinction that Brentano came to\nmake in his lectures in Vienna, however, was that between two branches\nof psychology (Brentano, [eds.] Baumgartner and Chisholm 1982). One of\nthese was descriptive psychology, also called descriptive\nphenomenology or psychognosy, and was concerned with analyzing\nconsciousness into its elements and specifying their modes of\ncombination. The other branch, genetic psychology, was to be concerned\nwith causal explanations of mental phenomena. Though Brentano\nmaintained that the latter branch required physiological\ninvestigations and also that physiology was not yet developed enough\nto deal with matters in genetic psychology, he thought that he had\nalready contributed to descriptive psychology in his Psychology\nfrom an Empirical Standpoint (Brentano 1874) and continued making\nfurther elaborations in this area through his lectures.\n\nAs Brentano characterized philosophy as including all the disciplines\nwhich involve descriptive psychology, Marty did the same as the rector\nof the University of Prague in his inaugural address in 1897 (Marty,\n[eds.] Eisenmeier et al., 69\u201393). On this view, philosophy\nencompasses at least three practical disciplines, namely logic\n(concerned with what judgments should be made), aesthetics (concerned\nwith what ideas or, as we shall say, presentations we should have),\nand ethics (concerned with what to love and what to hate). As regards\nthe theoretical branches of philosophy, Brentano and Marty considered\nthem to be descriptive psychology itself and also metaphysics. While\nit may seem unacceptable to characterize metaphysics as involving\npsychological concepts, Marty says:\n\nA closer consideration, however, yields the result that also\nmetaphysics and psychology, in spite of the difference of their\nsubject matters, closely belong together from a heuristic viewpoint\nand that the psychologist is the very one, more than any other\nresearcher, who appears to be suited to formulate and solve\nmetaphysical problems. Already with Kant, it is asked whether we have\nbesides analytic judgments also synthetic ones a priori, and\nwhether the latter are perhaps, like the former, everywhere necessary\nfor scientific progress. In contrast to leaving them empty and void\nupon leaving the phenomenal sphere, however, it is clear that only\npsychological investigation can decide this matter. It is a question\nwhose answer is a prerequisite for every ontological and cosmological\ninvestigation. Psychological experience and analysis is accordingly\nalso that which leads to the source and the true sense of the most\nimportant metaphysical concepts such as those of causality and of\nsubstance. And as regards that problem which occupied Aristotle,\nDescartes, and Leibniz so intensely, the question whether an analogue\nof the understanding and the tactical will forms the last hidden cause\nof all being and occurrence, it is obvious that this could not arise\non any other basis but a psychological one. The concepts of the\nunderstanding and the will are themselves taken from the domain of\nmind. What Aristotle says here is confirmed, that what is the first\nand earliest by nature is for our knowledge the last, for the area of\npsychology, in which the greatest complication and dependence obtains\nwith regard to its processes, is for us the starting point for the\ninvestigation of what is most simple and independent. (Marty, [eds.]\nEisenmeier et al. 1916, 79 f.)\n\n\nThus we see Marty defending the Brentanian conception of philosophy in\ngeneral and metaphysics in particular, with an appeal to Aristotle,\nwho was indeed Brentano\u2019s life-long guide through the labyrinth\nof philosophy. Moreover, though Marty\u2019s publications were mainly\nconcerned with applying Brentanian descriptive psychology to the study\nof language, he lectured on all the branches of philosophy, both\ntheoretical and practical, as well as history of philosophy. (See\nBokhove and Raynaud 1990, 247\u2013250.) It will be seen further\nbelow that metaphysics was indeed a very important concern of his.\n\nAs regards some of the particulars of Brentano\u2019s descriptive\npsychology, most important for understanding Marty\u2019s philosophy\nof language are 1) Brentano\u2019s thesis that mental phenomena (or\nacts of consciousness) are intentionally directed (as consciousness\nof an object), 2) his classification of mental phenomena into\nthree basic groups: presentations (Vorstellungen), judgments\n(Urteile), and phenomena of love (Liebe) and hate\n(Ha\u00df), as already indicated in the division of\npractical philosophy into three corresponding disciplines, 3) his\ncharacterization of all judgments as instances of acceptance or\nrejection which can be formulated in existential statements (\u201cA\nexists\u201d, \u201cA does not exist\u201d), and 4) his view that\nevery act of consciousness is inwardly perceived (innerlich\nwahrgenommen), though never inwardly observed (innerlich\nbeobachtet)in the sense of being an object of attention. In\naddition, 5) an important ontological position held by Brentano in his\nVienna period should be mentioned here, namely his distinction between\nreality and existence. While he held that existence corresponds to\ntruth in all cases, reality is limited to substances and everything\nthat pertains to substances (i.e. whatever belongs to the Aristotelian\ncategories). Accordingly anything that can be accepted in a true\njudgment can correctly be said to exist, including possibilities and\nimpossibilities, whereas not everything that exists in this sense is\nreal. During this time Brentano allowed for a host of\nirrealia, such as a lack, a possibility, an impossibility,\netc.\n\nAfter publishing his work on the perception of color (Marty 1879),\nMarty became a professor in Prague, where some of his students (such\nas Oskar Kraus, Alfred Kastil, Hugo Bergmann, and even for a brief\nperiod Franz Kafka) also came to be followers of Brentano. In the\nfollowing year Brentano had to resign as a professor in Vienna because\nhe got married. Since he had earlier received holy orders, including\nof course the vow of celibacy, his marriage was not acceptable in\nAustria, where there was no institution of civil marriage and\nCatholicism was dominant. Nevertheless, Brentano continued to lecture\nin Vienna until his full resignation in 1895. In the later nineteenth\ncentury and early in the twentieth century Brentano developed a\nphilosophical standpoint which Marty found objectionable. This was the\nview that only real things are conceivable and only real things can\nexist. Brentano therefore spent much of his philosophical effort\nduring his retirement analyzing away all the talk of\nirrealia, which he had accepted in his Vienna period. Marty,\nby contrast, retained the irrealia, though with certain\nrevisions in light of his correspondence with Brentano. Marty also\ncorresponded with other students of Brentano, such as Stumpf and\nEdmund Husserl (see Schuhmann [ed.] 1994, 69\u201396), and of course\nwith others in the wider philosophical and scientific community. Still\nthe fact remains that Brentano was the dominant philosopher in his\ncareer.\n\nMarty\u2019s writings often contain very extensive polemics against\nhis opponents and those of Brentano. Sometimes these polemics resulted\nin bitter animosity, as in his interchange with Christoph Sigwart (see\ne.g. Marty 1884 and Sigwart 1889). Sometimes Marty\u2019s criticisms\nwere received in good humor, as in the case of his very thorough-going\nand penetrating review of William James\u2019 Principles of\nPsychology (Marty 1892b). Whatever effects Marty\u2019s\npolemical style had on his contemporaries, the great misfortune from a\npresent-day standpoint is that his own positive views become\novershadowed by his criticisms of the views of others. With patience,\nhowever, it is possible to sift out from such criticisms his positive\nviews on a number of philosophical issues. The extent to which these\nviews are original cannot be fully assessed until Brentano\u2019s\nliterary remains are more adequately edited and published. Many of the\nviews which were developed in his later work nonetheless diverged from\nBrentano\u2019s earlier positions (as well as his own), but also from\nBrentano\u2019s later positions.\n2. Color Names and the Development of Color Perception\n\nOne of Marty\u2019s early works (Marty 1879) is concerned with a\nproblem that differs from the ones he treats in his other writings. In\nthe work under consideration he addresses the question whether the\nusage of color names in ancient Greek literature, especially Homer,\nprovides us with reasons to assume that human color perception has\nevolved in the last couple of thousand years. Homer sometimes clearly\nuses one and the same color term for very different colors and\nsometimes describes colors of everyday objects in a way which is\nsurprisingly incompatible with our contemporary color descriptions.\nThe description of the color of the sea as \u201cwine dark\u201d and\nmany other such instances in Homer, as has had been pointed out\n(Gladstone 1858, vol. III, 457 ff.), can be taken as a strong\nindication that the ancient Greeks perceived colors in a way that\ndiffers from our color perception. Some of Marty\u2019s\ncontemporaries thought that this is not only the case (Wenning 1990),\nbut also that the evidence suggested that the evolution of color\nperception starts with dark and bright and proceeds through the color\nspectrum. This would mean that the ancient Greeks could see red and\nperhaps yellow, though probably not green, blue, and violet. On the\nbasis of the physiological work of Ewald Hering on color perception\n(Hering 1878), Marty argued that such a development could not take\nplace. For it was a result of Hering\u2019s work that the perception\nof red and green was the result of the same neural system and that of\nthe perception of blue and yellow was the result of a distinct one.\nBlindness to red consequently goes together with blindness to green,\nas does blindness to blue with blindness to yellow. Moreover, Marty\nargues from various data, most notably ancient paintings, that the\nancient Greeks perceived all the colors that we do. However, if\nancient Greeks perceived the same colors as we do, how do we explain\nthe great difference between Homer\u2019s and our usage of color\nterms? Marty gives various reasons, but two seem to be specially\nimportant. Firstly, Marty insists that the proponents of the evolution\nof color perception fail to distinguish between color sensation and\njudgments in which colors are classified. They also forget to take\ninto account that language is primarily a means for communication, not\na tool for isolated theoretical descriptions. When people feel no\nspecial need to communicate about certain colors, they feel no need to\nclassify them with special terms. One term can therefore cover a wider\narea of color sensations (Marty 1879, 97 ff., see also Funke 1924,\n14). Secondly, Marty brings the poetic function of language and its\npoetic inner form into focus (Marty 1879, 78\u201394). The main goal\nof Homer\u2019s poetry was not to communicate exact observations, but\nto evoke powerful and aesthetically pleasing presentations with the\nhelp of metaphor and metonymy. This leads to a surprising and unusual\npoetic use of color terms employed in comparisons and presentation\nthrough relations. The fact that Marty elaborates on such distinctions\nis of particular significance because it already exemplifies how\nBrentanian descriptive psychology was being applied in his early work.\nThis was of course to be done more elaborately and systematically in\nhis later writings, especially his main work (Marty 1908a).\n3. Language\n\nMarty\u2019s philosophy of language deserves our attention for at\nleast two reasons. First of all, while his predecessors and\ncontemporaries were for the most part concerned with the development\nof language through history, e.g. phonological and semantic change,\nMarty devoted much more attention to language as it is. In his own\nterms, his investigations concerning language were primarily\ndescriptive rather than genetic. In contemporary terms, his focus was\nsynchronic rather than diachronic. In this regard he was a precursor\nof structuralism (Kiesow 1990). The second reason why Marty\u2019s\nphilosophy of language is worth examining lies in the fact that in\ncontrast to many others, who approached language as a product of\neither an alleged supra-human intelligence or lower psychological and\nphysiological mechanisms such as association and reflex, he\ninvestigated language as something that arises from individual human\nminds as intentionally directed to objects. Not only does\nintentionality in the usual sense of consciousness of\nsomething become focal in Marty\u2019s philosophy of language; he is\nalso concerned first and foremost with language \u201cin the sense of\nthe purposeful manifestation of inner life through certain\nsigns, especially through sounds and in particular those which \u2013\nlike most words of our spoken languages \u2013 are not intrinsically\nintelligible, but owe their significant power to custom and\ntradition\u201d (Marty 1908a, 3). His emphasis here on purposeful\nmanifestation (absichtliche Kundgabe) not only involves\nintention in the sense of the speaker\u2019s communicative goal of\nevoking similar psychical phenomena as those expressed by linguistic\nsigns in the hearer, but is also intention in the narrow sense of\ndirectedness toward intentional contents of expressed psychical\nphenomena (Formigari 2004, 162ff.; Cesalli & Mulligan 2017, 259\nff.). In this regard Marty was a precursor of yet another later\nmovement in the study of language, namely intentional semantics\n(Liedtke 1990).\n\nAs already indicated, Marty conceives of philosophy just as Brentano\ndid, namely as a discipline involving psychological considerations in\nall of its branches, both theoretical and practical. Philosophy of\nlanguage is accordingly restricted by him to that domain of linguistic\ninquiry which is tied up with the science of mind or consciousness.\nThose areas of linguistics which can be investigated independently of\npsychology, e.g. phonology, are no part of philosophy of language. It\nis altogether unacceptable to Marty to regard philosophy of language\nas distinct from the science of language, as if they were two\nendeavors concerned with one and the same subject matter and yet\ndiffering in their methods (Marty 1908a: 4 f.). In this regard he\nnever swayed from Brentano\u2019s precept that the true method of\nphilosophy is no different from that of the natural sciences.\n\nThough Marty\u2019s psychological approach differs from that of many\nother philosophers of language in the late nineteenth century as well\nas the early twentieth, one of the reasons why his work has been\nneglected by philosophers lies in their turn away from psychological\nconsiderations, as this can already be seen in Husserl\u2019s\ncritique of \u201cpsychologism\u201d (Husserl 1900) and also in\nFrege\u2019s anti-psychologistic work on logic and language, which\nhas had an especially profound effect on a good many philosophers in\nthe twentieth century and into the present one. (As regards the\npossibility of related charges of \u201cmentalism\u201d and\n\u201cintrospectionism\u201d, see Rollinger 2008: 73\u201386.)\nDuring his lifetime he had already been under suspicion from the\nNeo-Kantian camp as a proponent of psychologism, though he vehemently\ninsisted that he did not succumb to such a tendency in any invidious\nsense such as the one formulated by Husserl (Marty 1908a, 6\u201318).\nAbove all, it must be remembered that for Husserl psychologism\nentailed relativism. Both Marty and Brentano pointed out that their\napplications of psychology in philosophy in no way involved relativism\n(Brentano 1925, 179\u2013183). In view of the fact that consciousness\nand specific cognitive operations, particularly with an interest in\nintentionality, have become thematic in recent decades, it seems to be\nquite in order to take a new look at Marty\u2019s philosophy of\nlanguage as not entirely unrelated to the philosophical landscape of\nour times.\n3.1 The Origin of Language\n\nThough Marty did, as already indicated, focus much of his work on the\ndescription of language as it is, his first book On the Origin of\nLanguage (Marty 1875) was concerned with its origin. In this\nbook, Marty already applies some of the main ideas of his later\ndescriptive semasiology (see the following section) to refute two\nopposing views on the origin of language \u2013 nativism and\nempiricism \u2013 and to establish his own alternative, more\nteologically oriented explanation of the beginnings of language.\n\u201cNativism\u201d was represented especially by Heymann\nSteinthal, Moritz Lazarus, and Wilhelm Wundt, (See also the lengthy\nappendix against Wundt in Marty 1908a, 543\u2013738) \u2013 and goes\nback to Wilhelm Humboldt\u2019s concept of unconscious and inborn\nlanguage instinct and to his view of the essential relation of\nthinking to speaking. Nativism claims that language develops out of\nsound-producing reflexes and associations of these sounds with certain\nsensations and images. Thus, on the nativist view, language as the\npurposeful manifestation of inner life arose from behavior which was\noriginally altogether unintended (Marty 1875, 19). In other words,\nlanguage is originally \u201cnative\u201d and not something created\nor \u201cinvented\u201d in human conscious activity.\n\u201cEmpiricism\u201d, represented by Herbart, Grimm, Lotze, and\nWhitney, denies necessary connection of thinking to speaking as well\nas all inborn relations between certain thoughts and certain\narticulated sounds (Marty 1875, 44\u201345). Marty cannot accept\nnativism for the complete lack of empirical evidence in its favor and\ndiscusses many conceptual confusions on its part (Marty 1875,\n18\u201343). While he feels much more at home in the camp of\nempiricism and shares its critical stance toward nativism, he insists\nthat language is teleological in character rather than mechanistic and\nis of course supported by the psychology of intentionality. Marty\nmaintains that language originated from the basic human need to\ncommunicate and cooperate and was purposeful from the outset. This\nneed motivated conscious, but unplanned and unreflected formation of\nsyntactic forms and lexical means for purposeful externalization of\ninner life through articulated signs. Moreover, he uses associative\nmechanisms to explain origins of syntactic forms of language and to\ndescribe how new syntactic forms and vocabulary were suggested and\nbrought about by using already established meanings of expressions in\nnew contexts (see also the explanation of Marty\u2019s concept of\ninner form below). Marty later published a series of ten articles\n\u201cOn Speech Reflex, Nativism, and Purposeful Formation of\nLanguage\u201d (Marty 1884b, Marty 1886, Marty 1889, Marty 1890,\nMarty 1891, Marty 1892a) in which he continued to defend his this view\nand engaged in extensive polemics against new formulations of the\nopposing views. These views were in large measure developed out of\nHerbartian psychological theories and also meshed in with the whole\nprogram of a \u201cpsychology of peoples\u201d\n(V\u00f6lkerpsychologie). Much of the psychology, including\nalleged observations of children and so-called primitive people, used\nto support nativism is on his view highly erroneous. Marty\u2019s\ndefense of his theory in opposition to nativism involves descriptive\nsemasiology, which was to be developed more fully in his subsequent\nwritings, especially his main work, and is indeed the center piece of\nhis philosophical endeavors.\n3.2 Descriptive Semasiology\n\nIn the nineteenth century the term \u201csemasiology\u201d\n(Semasiologie) was often used in reference to linguistic\ninvestigations concerning meaning. Marty often uses this term in order\nto designate his philosophical investigations concerning language\nwhich are indeed by and large concerned with meaning. Other terms\nwhich are used by him more or less synonymously are\n\u201csemantics\u201d (Semantik) and \u201cuniversal\ngrammar\u201d (allgemeine Grammatik), especially in\nreference to his synchronic undertaking. Among Marty\u2019s\ncontemporaries Husserl spoke of \u201cpure grammar\u201d (reine\nGrammatik), which was, however, conceived of as part of formal\nlogic (Husserl 1901, 286\u2013321). Insofar as Marty\u2019s\nuniversal grammar is a semasiology developed in the framework of\nBrentanian descriptive psychology and with a look to universal forms\nunderlying communicative intention, Marty thinks that his endeavor is\nquite distinct from \u2013 and of greater philosophical significance\nthan \u2013 Husserl\u2019s foray into the grammatical domain which\nattempts to single out and describe pure logical grammar a\npriori and in abstraction from the communicative function of\nlanguage (Husserl 1901, Marty 1908a, 56\u201363, Seron 2017,\n309\u2013324, Leblanc 2017, 325\u2013344).\n\nA crucial distinction in Marty\u2019s descriptive semasiology is that\nbetween those expressions which have meaning independently and those\nwhich do not (Marty 1908a, 205 ff.). He calls the former\n\u201cautosemantic expressions\u201d (autosemantische\nAusdr\u00fccke) or simply \u201cautosemantica\u201d\n(Autosemantika), as exemplified by names and sentences of\nvarious kinds, whereas he calls the latter \u201csynsemantic\nexpressions\u201d (synsemantische Ausdr\u00fccke) or simply\n\u201csynsemantica\u201d (Synsemantika), as exemplified by\nparticles (\u201cand\u201d, \u201cif\u201d, etc.) as well as\ninflected nouns and verbs.\n\nIt is also of importance here to understand Marty\u2019s concept of\ninner linguistic form. This concept had been introduced by Wilhelm von\nHumboldt in order to designate the total worldview\n(Weltanschauung) of a people who speaks the language in\nquestion and even tied with the notion of the spirit of a people\n(Volksgeist), but also with imagery that occurs in the usage\nof a language. While such notions as worldview and the spirit of a\npeople play no role in Marty\u2019s descriptive semasiology, he still\nfinds it appropriate to designate the inner linguistic form (or\n\u201cetymon\u201d), understood as \u201ca presentation which\nserves as a link of association between the outwardly perceivable sign\nand its meaning\u201d (Marty 1884: 298), whether it be autosemantic\nor synsemantic. Outstanding examples of inner linguistic form are\nprovided by the ideas behind various figurative expressions which are\nbuilt into a language, e.g. \u201cto give hand\u201d and \u201cto\nsweep an opinion aside\u201d. Here images are called to mind, as can\nreadily be confirmed by inner perception, and are useful in making us\nunderstand what is meant, without resorting to more complex\nexpressions. In his later work Marty differentiated the figurative\ninner form of expression, as this has just been indicated, from the\nconstructive inner form (Marty 1908, 144\u2013150). Since our\nunderstanding of utterances in communication is a gradual process,\nouter expression of uncompleted utterances bring about certain\naccessory presentations which build expectation with regard to the\nwhole meaning of the not yet finished utterances. Different languages,\nor, for example, different rhetorical styles and artistic means of\nexpression use different typical forms of preparatory constructions of\nmeanings. These preparatory presentations (inner constructive forms)\nbound with outer forms of partial expressions cannot be equated with\nthe meaning of the utterance which appertains only to the whole\nexpression once its utterance is finished. Though Marty was by no\nmeans unique among the linguists and philosophers of language after\nvon Humboldt in making use of such a concept, he was also critical of\nmany of his contemporaries, especially the nativists, who were, on his\nview, conflating the inner linguistic forms of expressions and their\nmeanings. Such a conflation, he maintains, was already made by von\nHumboldt, for the worldview of a people who speaks a given language is\nmore accurately identified with the meanings conveyed by applications\nof language and not with images or other inner forms which link these\nexpressions with the meanings. Moreover, Marty finds some of his\ncontemporaries, such as Berthold Delbr\u00fcck, to be involved in a\nconfusion between inner and outer linguistic form (i.e. the\nperceivable part of linguistic sign). This last point is also related\nto Marty\u2019s efforts to argue that there is a distinction between\na linguistic expression and its meaning. As obvious as this may be at\npresent, some of Marty\u2019s contemporaries wished to identify the\ntwo \u2013 perhaps as an after-effect of Schelling\u2019s\n\u201cidentity philosophy\u201d which Brentano had already laid to\nrest in W\u00fcrzburg. Accordingly Marty\u2019s semasiology is\nconcerned with the complex unity (not identity) of\n\u201clinguistic expression \u2013 inner linguistic form \u2013\nmeaning\u201d.\n\nAs already noted, Marty\u2019s approach to language differs from that\nof many others insofar as he makes the notion of intentionality\ncentral in his investigations. In his earlier work he followed\nBrentano in adopting an immanentist version of this notion. That is to\nsay, for the early Marty the thesis that every mental phenomenon\nintentionally refers to an object is equivalent to saying that there\nis an object (content) immanent to every phenomenon of mind. In his\nletter to Husserl (reprinted in Schuhmann 1994, 71\u201374, English\ntranslation in Mulligan 1990, 228\u2013232), Marty points out the\nproblem of non-existing objects as the main motivation of this theory.\nIntention, as any proper relation, requires the existence of its\nterms. If an intention exists, its intentional object must exist as\nwell. However, the actual object of the intentional presenting does\nnot always exist. Therefore the actually non-existing presented object\ndoes not exist really but only intentionally and immanently\n\u201cin\u201d the presentation. While the transcendent object of\npresentation sometimes exist and sometimes does not, the immanent\nobject (or immanent content as it was also called) of presentation\nalways exists. Furthermore, judgments and phenomena of love and hate\nhave their own immanent contents \u2013 the judged as such (the being\nor non-being of the presented object) and the loved and hated as such\n(the positive or negative value of the presented object). Marty was of\nconsequently critical of other philosophers, such as William James (in\nconnection with the thesis that an idea never occurs twice in\nconsciousness, as stated in James 1890, especially Chapter XII), for\nfailing to distinguish between the object immanent to an act of\nconsciousness and the real object allegedly external to consciousness\n(Marty 1916a, 139 ff.). As the immanentist understanding of\nintentionality was eventually abandoned by Brentano and other students\nof his (see for example posthumously published collection of\nBrentano\u2019s texts, Brentano 1966), Marty is no exception in this\nregard. In his main work he accordingly attempted another formulation\nof the notion of intentionality. The consciousness of an object is\ntaken by Marty to be a similarity (\u00c4hnlichkeit),\n\u201csimilarizing\u201d (Ver\u00e4hnlichung), likeness\n(Gleichheit), conformity (Konformit\u00e4t), or\nadequation (Ad\u00e4quation) between the mental act and its\nobject, though he stresses that this similarity (to use one of his\nterms) is purely mind-dependent (ideell) and indeed\naltogether unique to these phenomena (Marty 1908a, 333, 406 ff.,\n413\u2013418, 423 ff., 430, 444, 453, 481, 487). As stated, the ideal\nsimilarity or ideal (\u00c4hnlichkeit),\n\u201csimilarizing\u201d appertains to the intentional act, not to\nthe immanent object, for there are no immanent objects. These are now\nviewed by Marty as linguistic fictions suggested by the inner form of\nsuch expressions as \u201cpresented object\u201d, \u201cjudged\nobject\u201d, \u201cloved object\u201d etc. Marty\u2019s\nalternative concept of intentionality as similarity is, without a\ndoubt, one of the most difficult aspects of his descriptive\npsychology. Ideal similarity is for him in no way the same as the\nsimilarity to be found among physical objects (Marty 1908a, 408).\nWhile similarity in the ordinary sense has a negative character and\nallows for degrees of more and less, ideal similarity holding between\nthe act and its object lacks these features (Marty 1908a). However,\nthe fact that ideal and ordinary similarity are both grounded\nrelations and that in both cases we find a relative determination next\nto a correlation (Marty 1908a, 413) makes it possible to use the word\n\u201csimilarity\u201d in an analogical way to characterize\n\u201cintentional directedness\u201d of mental phenomena (for\nfurther explanations see Chrudzimski 2001, Cesalli & Taieb 2013,\nCesalli 2017b, Majolino 2017). It should be noted that correlation of\nthe act and its object is now formulated by Marty in counterfactual\nterms: if the object of the mental act existed, it would necessarily\nbe the correlate of that act. Therefore the intentional being of the\nin-existing immanent object is not required for the act to count as\nintentional. Marty is very critical of philosophers who make\nintentionality central in their treatment of mind and yet fail to take\ninto account mind-dependent likeness. Such a philosopher, according to\nMarty, is Husserl, who allegedly construes intentionality in terms of\nthe relation of sign to signified object and thereby falls into an\nunacceptable semanticism (Semantizismus) (Marty 1908a, 762;\nfor a discussion of Marty and Husserl, see Rollinger 1999,\n209\u2013244). It is, however, fortunate that a good deal of what he\nsays of mind and language does not require an understanding of this\nconcept.\n\nIt is difficult to state Marty\u2019s theory of meaning for two\nreasons. First of all, he speaks of meaning in at least two different\nsenses. In the \u201cnarrower\u201d sense, Marty regards the\ncontents of mental acts as the meaning of an expression. In the second\nsense, which might be called the meaning in the wider sense (Marty\n1908a, 291\u2013292), he also considers the meaning of an expression\nto be its communicative function. In this wider sense the meaning of a\nstatement, for instance, is not merely something contained in the\nconsciousness of the speaker who makes the statement or even some sort\nof entity that exists outside of his or her consciousness. The meaning\nof the statement can rather only be formulated by saying that the\ninterlocutor intends to evoke a like judgment on the side of the\nhearer \u2013 what he or she judges should be accepted. This is the\nso called primary communicative intention of the speaker. Moreover, by\nuttering a statement the speaker secondarily manifests that he or she\njudges that such and such is the case. This manifestation of the act\nof judging is the so called secondary communicative intention of the\nspeaker, which serves as means for attaining the primary goal (Marty\n1908a, 284n.; Cesalli & Mulligan 2017, 260; Janou\u0161ek 2017,\n243). Here, however, we confront the second reason why it is difficult\nto shortly state Marty\u2019s theory of meaning in general terms. The\nprimary communicative function of an expression will vary according to\nthe type of expression in question. It is thus indispensable to\nelaborate on meaning as communicative function by examining its\nvariety. This will be done here with respect to the autosemantica, as\nindeed Marty does at length in his main work.\n\nIt is in the classification of autosemantica where Brentanian\ndescriptive psychology especially comes into play in Marty\u2019s\ndescriptive semasiology. While Brentano had maintained that every act\nof the mind belongs to one of three classes, namely presentations,\njudgments, and acts of love and hate, Marty says that autosemantica\nlikewise fall into three classes, namely names\n(Vorstellungssuggestive), statements (Aussagen) and\nexpressions of interest (Emotive), each one corresponding to\na class of mental phenomena. In the elaboration of his view he opposes\nthree alternative views concerning the division of such phenomena held\nby certain predecessors and contemporaries: 1) the prevailing view of\nthe nineteenth century in the German speaking world, namely that the\nphenomena of mind are to be divided into thinking, feeling, and\nwilling, 2) the view attributed to Herbart as well as other\nphilosophers, namely that the mind consists only of presentations (or,\nas one might also say, ideas), and 3) the view of Meinong and his\nfollowers in the Graz school, that there is a class of mental\nphenomena, called \u201cassumptions\u201d (Annahmen), which\nlies \u201cbetween\u201d presentations and judgments (see Meinong\n1902, Marty 1905, Meinong 1906, Meinong 1910). We will begin with a\nbrief discussion of Marty\u2019s treatment of statements, then we\nwill briefly address emotives and conclude with names.\n\nStatements (Aussagen) make up the autosemantica which express\njudgments. This class of expressions received considerable attention\nfrom Marty in his early work (Marty 1884), especially with regard to\nthe problem of statements which apparently have no subject, so-called\n\u201cimpersonals\u201d (Impersonalien). While statements\nof this kind were a grave embarrassment to the traditional conception\nof judgment as predication, Marty argued at length, in opposition to\nthe views of many philosophers, psychologists, and linguists, that the\nimpersonals are best understood as expressing judgments in which\nsomething is accepted or rejected or, as one may alternatively\nformulate his view, regarded as existent or non-existent. If, for\ninstance, the impersonal \u201cIt is raining\u201d is under\nconsideration, there is no need to theorize about a mysterious entity\nto which \u201cit\u201d refers, for this statement only expresses\nthe judgment that there exists the event of raining within the\nspeakers vicinity. Such an approach to impersonals had already been\nadvanced by a specialist in the Slavic languages (Miklosich 1883; cf.\nBrentano 1889: 109\u2013133). Marty cites this philological work with\napproval, but it is clear that the main inspiration behind his\napproach is Brentano.\n\nIn his attempt to defend the Brentanian theory of judgment in the\nlinguistic domain Marty makes an effort to reformulate various\nstatements in order to show that they are actually instances of\naccepting or rejecting. As Brentano maintained that the judgments in\nthe traditional square of opposition are to be exhibited by construing\nthe universal ones as negative (\u201cEvery A is\nB\u201d = \u201cThere is no A which is not\nB\u201d, \u201cNo A is B\u201d =\n\u201cThere is no A which is B\u201d) and the\nparticular ones as affirmative (\u201cSome A is\nB\u201d = \u201cThere is an A which is\nB\u201d, \u201cSome A is not B\u201d =\n\u201cThere is an A which is not B\u201d), Marty\nfinds such reformulations acceptable. Moreover, he identifies a class\nof judgments such as \u201cThis tree is green\u201d or \u201cThis\ntree is not green\u201d as double judgments (Doppelurteile),\nwhich is again a notion he explicitly takes from Brentano (Marty 1897:\n179 ff.). What is peculiar about double judgments is that the subject\nterm, e.g. \u201cthis tree\u201d, already expresses an instance of\nacceptance (the tree is) and there is another affirmation or rejection\n(Zuerkennen, Aberkennen) of \u201cBeing-so\u201d expressed\nby the grammar form of a predicate, e.g. \u201cis green\u201d, built\nupon this acceptance. The double judgment then, according to Marty,\ncould be formulated as having the form \u201c the green-being of the\n[already existentially affirmed] tree is\u201d for the predicative\naffirmation and \u201c the green-being of the [already existentially\naffirmed] tree is not\u201d for the predicative negation (Marty 1895,\n263f., see also Chrudzimski 2009). It follows that for Marty all\npredication of \u201cBeing-so\u201d involves existential affirmation\nof the subject. While the statements which belong to the four classes\nidentified in the traditional square of opposition are regarded as\n\u201cpseudo-categorical\u201d (i.e. having the appearance of being\npredicative without actually being so) because they are better\nexpressed in the existential form rather than the predicative one,\ndouble judgments on Marty\u2019s view are to be considered\ncategorical because they cannot be properly expressed without the\nsubject-predicate grammar form. Moreover, he also identifies certain\nstatements as \u201ccategoroid\u201d, namely those disjunctive and\nhypothetical statements which do not express double judgments.\nMarty\u2019s attempt to regard these as instances of acceptance and\nrejection, which can ultimately be reformulated existentially,\ninvolves him in some rather intricate considerations.\n\nWhile Marty ascribes to statements the communicative function (and\nthus in one, normatively viewed, sense the meaning) \u201cthat one\nshould judge as the speaker does\u201d, he points out that a demand\non the interlocutor\u2019s will is not thereby made as it is in the\ncase of certain other linguistic expressions, e.g. commands. A\nstatement is, by contrast to these, only \u201ca suggestive of\njudging\u201d (ein Suggestiv zum Urteilen) (Marty\n1908a 288). Moreover, there are certain aspects of the judgment which\ncannot be communicated in a statement, namely whether the judgment is\nevident or blind and whether it is apodictic or assertoric (Marty\n1908a 289 ff.). As Marty further elaborates, he says:\n\nIn a narrower sense, however, we call \u2026 something in addition\nthe meaning of a statement. Whoever states, \u201cA\nis\u201d, provided that he himself judges so, treats A as an\nentity and asks of the interlocutor as well that he, with trust in\nthis externalized conduct of the speaker, should treat A as\nan entity. In this regard we say also that the statement makes known\nthe being of A and aims at making it known or believes that\nit is doing so and means it in this sense. And since we often\nalso designate the being of A or that A is, also\nA\u2018s being-B or that A is B,\nas the content of the judgment \u201cA is\u201d or\n\u201cA is B\u201d and again designate the\nnon-being of A and A\u2018s not-being-B as\nthe content of the judgment \u201cA is not\u201d or\n\u201cA is not B\u201d, we can also say: the\nstatement makes known the content of judgment and means it in\nthis sense. (Marty 1908a: 292)\n\n\nWhen Marty speaks of the meaning of a statement as the content of the\njudgment which is thereby expressed, he is well aware of opening the\npossibility of comparisons with similar concepts in the work of\nvarious philosophers, e.g. the proposition in itself (Satz an\nsich) (Bolzano), the state of affairs (Sachverhalt)\n(Stumpf and Husserl), and the objective (Objektiv) (Meinong).\nAccordingly he faces the same difficulty that these others also had to\nface, i.e. determining the ontological status of such a thing (or\nnon-thing). It is Marty\u2019s view that contents of judgment exist\nin the sense that it is correct to accept them and are furthermore\nnon-real. What it means to be real for the mature Marty is to be\ninvolved in a causal nexus. (On his earlier view, real was whatever\ncould be subsumed under the Aristotelian categories.) While he regards\nphysical and mental things or events as real, he maintains that\ncontents of judgment, i.e. the meanings of statements \u201cin the\nnarrower sense\u201d, have only a co-becoming (Mitwerden),\nwhich does not allow them to be characterized as real. Thus, in\nworking out a descriptive semasiology of statements Marty puts forward\na very important ontological thesis.\n\nThe ontological thesis that there are in addition to real objects also\nnon-real ones such as contents of judgment was for Marty an important\ndeparture from Brentanian doctrine. Though Brentano and the early\nMarty had allowed for irrealia strictly as objects immanent\nto consciousness, Brentano came to reject this theory in favor of\nsaying that the non-real consists only of linguistic fictions. Marty\nhimself came to have misgivings about the notion of immanent objects\nand his term \u201ccontent of judgment\u201d in his main work must\nnot be taken as an indication of something that actually or\n\u201cintentionally\u201d exists in consciousness. However, Marty,\nwho never accepted Brentano\u2019s explanation of truth in terms of\nevidence, kept the mind-independent contents of judgments to ground\nhis theory of the correctness or objectivity of judgments. A judgment\nis correct when it is ideally adequate to the judgment content, that\nis to the state of affairs (Marty 1916, 155\u2013156, see also Smith\n1995, Chrudzimski 2014, Cesalli & Mulligan, 2017). When we\napprehend judgment as being evident we co-apprehend its ideal adequacy\nwith the content judgment Marty 1908, 314), or in other words, in\nevidence correctness of judgments manifests itself (Marty 1916, 157).\nIt should be noted that Marty\u2019s contents of judgment must not be\nconstrued as ideal universal objects, such as meanings according to\nHusserl\u2019s view in the Logical Investigations. While\nHusserl maintains that meanings are species (of meaning-giving acts or\nof certain parts of such acts) and are as such timeless (Husserl 1901:\n23\u2013105), Marty ascribes to them a co-becoming which of course\ninvolves temporality and certainly does not characterize them as\nself-subsisting species, but rather as founded or supervenient\nentities. Contents of judgment and other non-real entities, as Marty\nunderstands them, do not include universals of any kind, whether these\nbe genera or species. In short, Husserl\u2019s view on such matters\nis closer to some sort of Platonism than Marty\u2019s is. There\nremains a very definite alliance with Aristotle in Marty\u2019s\nontology (Marty 1908a, 337 f.).\n\nAs Marty regards statements as autosemantica which manifest judgments\nand communicate to the interlocutor that he or she is to judge in the\nsame way, he characterizes emotives or interest-demanding expressions\n(interesseheischende Ausdr\u00fccke) as those autosemantic\nwhich manifest not only emotions, but also volitions (which for him\nand Brentano belong to one and the same class), and communicate to the\ninterlocutor that he or she is to feel or will in the same way. The\nanalogy between statements and judgments is upheld by Marty to great\nlengths.\n\nIn view of this analogy the following passage is of particular\ninterest:\n\nIs an analogue of the judgment-content really missing in the realm of\ninterest? I don\u2019t believe it is. To be sure, a thoroughly\nsubjectivistic and in this sense erroneously\n\u201cpsychologistic\u201d view is very widespread, which does not\naccept the distinction between what is merely loveable as a matter of\nfact and what is worthy of love and between a blind compulsion and an\n\u201cought\u201d in the sense of a norm of correctness in this\nrealm. However, even though it calls itself \u201cvalue\ntheory\u201d, it is still unable to give a satisfactory account of\nthe concept of value and disvalue just as the analogous psychologistic\ndoctrine in the realm of epistemology is unable to give such an\naccount of the concept of the true and the false. Only if value and\ndisvalue are truly analogues of the true and the false \u2026 can\nthere also be in the realm of interest an analogue of correctness and\nincorrectness, and both are possible only if there is something\nindependent of the subjective phenomenon of loving and hating and in\nthis sense objective that establishes that correctness of mental\nconduct, just as the being of the object is the objective foundation\nfor the correctness of the acceptance thereof, its non-being for the\nrejection thereof. Without such a firm basis and standard all talk of\nvalue and disvalue, good and evil, and also of what is in accordance\nwith duty and what is against it, etc. would be without natural\njustification and sanction (Marty 1908, 370).\n\n\nThus we see that in his descriptive semasiology of emotives Marty puts\nforward a very important axiological thesis. Certain acts of love and\nhate can be correct as well. This correctness manifests itself in\nevident acts of love and hate and consists in their ideal adequacy to\nthe value and disvalue of the object, or a state of values\n(Wertverhalt) as Marty sometimes calls these contents. The\nmention of epistemology in the passage quoted should also not go\nunnoticed. There is accordingly a very strong sense in which\nMarty\u2019s descriptive semasiology involves a very forcefully\nstated anti-psychologism in all domains of philosophy. The price of\nthis anti-psychologism, however, is an ontology that allows for\nnon-real entities, whether they be the objective correlates of\njudgments or interest.\n\nThe final class of autosemantica for Marty consists of names and other\nexpressions which serve to express presentations. He calls these\n\u201cpresentational suggestives\u201d\n(Vorstellungssuggestive) and devotes a very extensive chapter\nof his main work to the treatment of them. (See Marty 1908,\n383\u2013489). He ascribes to these a communicative function just as\nhe did to the other autosemantica. \u201cAs the direct purpose of a\nstatement is to evoke in the interlocutor a certain judgment\u201d,\nsays Marty, \u201ca presentational suggestive also and especially a\nname primarily in its proper usage aims at awakening in him a certain\npresentation, and as that primary intention is ultimately designated\nas the meaning of a statement, the analogue is called the meaning of\nthe name\u201d (Marty 1908a, 384 f.). The autosemantica which have\nsuch function (meaning in the wider sense) and are everywhere\nacknowledged as being able to stand as subjects in a predicative\nconnection are called \u201cnames\u201d, as exemplified by \u201ca\ntriangle\u201d, \u201ca rectangle\u201d, \u201can equilateral\ntriangle\u201d, \u201ca human being who has committed a\ncrime\u201d, \u201csomething red\u201d, \u201csomething\nround\u201d, \u201ca red thing that is round\u201d, and also\ninfinitives such as \u201cto get up early\u201d and \u201cto have\none\u2019s hands full\u201d. As regards the presentational\nsuggestives which are not names, Marty points out the usage of\nlanguage in poetry and fiction (Marty 1908, 474 ff.). While the\nsentences used in such instances may resemble statements, for the most\npart they have the function of expressing and evoking presentations\nand are not actually statements. However, these whole sentences are\npeculiar insofar as the relevant presentations have contents of\njudgment as their objects. Such presentations of contents of judgment\nare on Marty\u2019s view the acts of consciousness which Meinong\nerroneously identified as assumptions (Marty 1905).\n\nWhile it is thus possible to present contents of judgment and\npresentational suggestives also have a communicative function that is\nanalogous to that of statements and emotives, the question arises as\nto whether there are also contents (i.e. special objects) of\npresentation analogous to the contents (states of affairs, states of\nvalues) in the other two cases of mental acts. In this regard Marty\nundertakes to criticize his older view that there are indeed such\ncontents under the heading of \u201cimmanent objects\u201d (Marty\n1908a 384\u2013406). He no longer holds this view in his later\nwritings and also rejects the notion of a thorough-going analogy\nbetween presentations and mental acts of the other two classes. As\nregards the old thesis that consciousness is always the consciousness\nof something, he endeavors to preserve this by appealing to the\nalready mentioned notion of mind-dependent conformity to an object,\nwhich may be either actually or potentially named by the\npresentational suggestive (Marty 1908a 407\u2013431). Thus Marty\ndiffers the meaning (Bedeutung) in the sense of the\nconceptual presentation to be evoked and the reference of names\n(das Gennante). He further offers interesting discussions of\nthe differences concerning reference of general and singular names\n(definite descriptions and proper names). General names refer via\ntheir conceptual presentative content (mediantibus conceptibus \u2013\nMarty 1908, 436) to indefinitely many objects of the extension fixed\nby the conceptual presentation. Singular descriptions are for Marty\nnames which name via their complex conceptual concept definitely, but\nessentially incompletely, since a concept, however complex it is, can\nnever \u201cexhaust\u201d the individuality of the object. Therefore\nvarious complex concepts can be used for one individual \u2013\n\u201cfor example, teacher of Alexander the Great and founder of the\nperipatetic School for Aristotle\u201d (Marty 1908, 438). Proper\nnames refer definitely, but they leave completely undecided what\nobjects is to be named by them and even what individual presentation\nis to be evoked by their use (Marty 1908, 439). The reference is fixed\nin the context of their introduction and the individual presentation\nevoked by the name can never be considered as the meaning of the\nproper name (Landgrebe 1934, 83\u201390, Gabriel 1990). Finally, it\nis also noteworthy that the autosemantic character of names does not\nstand on an equal footing with the autosemantic character of fictive\nstatements, actual statements and emotives. To form an actual or\nfictive (merely presented) speech, which both are for Marty practical\nautosemantic expressions (praktische Autosemantica), we never\nuse names in isolation. However even when used in isolation, names\nstill have a certain kind of complete meaning in contrast to, for\ninstance, mere particles or flexed substantives \u2013 due to this\ncompleteness Marty views names as theoretical autosemantic expressions\n(theoretische Autosemantica). (Marty 1908, 476\u2013477,\nFunke 1924, 23) Moreover, he continues to uphold the thesis, as\nalready found in Brentano\u2019s work, that all mental acts which are\nnot themselves presentations are founded on presentations (Marty\n1908a: 479\u2013489).\n4. Space and Time\n\nThough Marty\u2019s publications are almost exclusively concerned\nwith linguistic matters, he lectured extensively in all areas of\nphilosophy. Most of his literary remains have indeed been left\nunpublished. (See the catalogue in Bokhove and Raynaud 1990:\n250\u2013264.) The extensive correspondence with Brentano, most of\nwhich is also unpublished, is of course of great interest in\nconnection with both of these philosophers. No ultimate assessment of\nMarty\u2019s philosophical accomplishment will be possible until this\nmaterial, including lecture notes, letters, and other manuscripts of\ninterest, becomes accessible. A couple of years after his death,\nhowever, a work by him on space and time was published (Marty, [eds.]\nEisenmeier et al. 1916c). This work gives us a rare look into\nMarty\u2019s mature ontology. Though the resulting ontology of space\nand time is very much in line with Newtonian physics, it should be\nnoted that Marty\u2019s work on space and time was published\nposthumously in the same year in which Einstein\u2019s celebrated\npaper on general relativity appeared (Einstein 1916). Unlike Brentano,\nhe did not have the advantage of living long enough to have the chance\nof responding to the new concept of space-time that won the day in\nphysics (Brentano, [ed.] K\u00f6rner and Chisholm 1976: 29 f.). The\nwork may nonetheless prove of to be of value at least insofar as it\ncontains criticisms of the views of such outstanding philosophers as\nLeibniz, Berkeley, Kant, and Lotze.\n\nIn the work under consideration Marty argues for the thesis that space\nand time exist objectively as non-real entities. This thesis is\nmaintained in opposition not only to the various philosophical systems\nin which space or time is regarded as subjective, e.g. as an a\npriori form of intuition, but also in opposition to\nBrentano\u2019s later view, according to which space and time is to\nbe regarded as a linguistic fiction used to describe real things in\ntheir various modes. While it is indeed a misfortune that Marty is\nrelying on a discarded view from the standpoint of physics, his thesis\nthat space and time are non-real entities and his defense of a\ncontainer conception of space (Johansson 2019, 99) must be\ndistinguished from his Newtonian presuppositions. Just as followers of\nKant have managed to adhere to his views on space and time in spite of\nemergence of non-Euclidean geometries and the theory of relativity,\nMarty\u2019s basic ontological view on these matters can be\nconsidered apart from such developments, however important they may be\n(for a contemporary defense of Marty\u2019s conception of space see\nJohansson 2019).\n5. Marty\u2019s Legacy\n\nAs a professor in Prague Marty managed to exercise considerable\ninfluence, though this influence in many cases amounted to winning\nconverts to Brentano\u2019s philosophy, even on points where he and\nBrentano diverged. Among these converts were Oskar Kraus, Alfred\nKastil, and Hugo Bergmann. The former two were of course very active\nin editing Brentano\u2019s writings, many of which were taken from\nhis literary remains. Though the resulting editions were not done\naccording to the standards of critical editing and will ultimately\nhave to be replaced, they served for a long time to keep\nBrentano\u2019s thought alive. Marty was accordingly very important\nin the continued interest among philosophers in Brentano through two\nworld wars and an ever-changing philosophical climate that has not\nalways been entirely conducive to the intellectual orientation of\nBrentano, Marty, or other students of Brentano.\n\nAs regards the reception of Marty\u2019s own philosophical views,\nthis can be found in the case of the Prague Linguistic Circle which\narose after his death (Le\u0161ka 1995) and also to some extent in\nPolish philosophy (Wole\u0144ski 1990). Moreover, Marty was by no\nmeans unknown among the Munich phenomenologists (Schuhmann 1990) and\nmay well, with his emphasis on communicative function, have had a hand\nin their theories of speech acts. The most salient case of the\nreception of Marty, however, is that of Karl B\u00fchler\u2019s\ntheory of language, in which Marty\u2019s contribution is explicitly\nacknowledged (B\u00fchler 1934). Be this as it may, Marty\u2019s\nviews still await further examination and possibly further absorption\ninto the continuing developments of linguistics and philosophy of\nlanguage. The lament which was expressed more than eighty years ago\n(Funke 1924), that Marty\u2019s work had not been sufficiently\nappreciated by the linguists of that time, can still very well be\nexpressed today. The main obstacle here, aside from the already\nmentioned charge of psychologism, is the difficulty involved in\nreading his writings. While Meinong and Husserl wrote sentences which\nseem to go on forever, the polemics that Marty incessantly conducts\nmake his works even less palatable than theirs for many a reader,\nespecially since the targets of his polemics are in many cases authors\nwho are either forgotten or known by less than a handful of\nspecialists. It is thus no wonder that no extensive philosophical text\nof his has been translated into English until recently (Marty\n2010a\u20132010d). Nevertheless, a case can be made, as this has\nbriefly been indicated in the foregoing discussion, that the voice of\nMarty was unique in philosophy of mind and especially in philosophy of\nlanguage and perhaps in ontology as well. By no means have the\npossibilities of drawing philosophical sustenance from his work been\nexhausted.\n",
