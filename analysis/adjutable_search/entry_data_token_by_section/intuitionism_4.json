    "main_text": "Mathematics || The BHK-interpretation\n3.1 The BHK-interpretation\n\nIn intuitionism, knowing that a statement A is true means\nhaving a proof of it. In 1934 Arend Heyting, who had been a student of\nBrouwer, introduced a form of what became later known as the\nBrouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov-interpretation, which captures the\nmeaning of the logical symbols in intuitionism, and in constructivism\nin general as well. It defines in an informal way what an\nintuitionistic proof should consist of by indicating how the\nconnectives and quantifiers should be interpreted. \n\n\\(\\bot\\) is not provable.\nA proof of \\(A\\wedge B\\) consists of a proof of \\(A\\) and a proof\nof \\(B\\).\nA proof of \\(A \\vee B\\) consists of a proof of \\(A\\) or a proof of\n\\(B\\).\nA proof of \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is a construction which transforms\nany proof of \\(A\\) into a proof of \\(B\\).\nA proof of \\(\\exists x A(x)\\) is given by presenting an element\n\\(d\\) of the domain and a proof of \\(A(d)\\).\nA proof of \\(\\forall x A(x)\\) is a construction which transforms\nevery proof that \\(d\\) belongs to the domain into a proof of\n\\(A(d)\\).\n\n\nThe negation \\(\\neg A\\) of a formula \\(A\\) is proven once it has been\nshown that there cannot exist a proof of \\(A\\), which means providing\na construction that derives falsum from any possible proof of \\(A\\).\nThus \\(\\neg A\\) is equivalent to \\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\). The\nBHK-interpretation is not a formal definition because the notion of\nconstruction is not defined and therefore open to different\ninterpretations. Nevertheless, already on this informal level one is\nforced to reject one of the logical principles ever-present in\nclassical logic: the principle of the excluded middle \\((A\\vee \\neg\nA)\\). According to the BHK-interpretation this statement holds\nintuitionistically if the Creating Subject knows a proof of \\(A\\) or a\nproof that \\(A\\) cannot be proved. In the case that neither for \\(A\\)\nnor for its negation a proof is known, the statement \\((A \\vee \\neg\nA)\\) does not hold. The existence of open problems, such as the\nGoldbach conjecture or the Riemann hypothesis, illustrates this fact.\nBut once a proof of \\(A\\) or a proof of its negation is found, the\nsituation changes, and for this particular \\(A\\) the principle \\((A\n\\vee \\neg A)\\) is true from that moment on.\n",
