    "main_text": "Psychology and Cognition || Three Degrees of Evidence\n4.3 Three Degrees of Evidence\n\nWhat then does all this mean for the question of certitude and the\npossibility of building a genuine and trustworthy science based on\nthese foundational impressions received from the natural world?\nWodeham defended the reliability of our immediate simple\napprehensions, but he also admitted the possibility that the\nimagination can severely distort these impressions such that we are\ninclined to assent to what the simple apprehension itself does not\nwarrant.\n\nWodeham discusses the question of evidence for a proposition which can\nbe built from these initial apprehensions in the sixth question of the\nprologue. He says that the idea of \u201ccomplex evidence\u201d can\nbe understood in two ways: either as referring to the apprehension of\nan evident proposition itself or to the so-called \u201cevident\njudgment\u201d which has been caused by this evident proposition.\n\nWhat Wodeham means by an evident proposition is complicated and\nrequires that we have a clear sense of the distinction between\napprehension and judgment, which are for Wodeham two distinct and\nseparate acts. An evident proposition for Wodeham can be of three\nkinds. The first and lowest degree of evidence is identified with the\napprehension of the proposition (or what it signifies). Wodeham uses\nas his example the proposition, \u201ca stick submerged in water is\nbroken\u201d. The apprehension of this state of affairs has all the\ntrappings of an evident proposition, to such an extent that it\ninclines us to perform the separate act of producing an affirmative\njudgment. Nevertheless, this type of proposition is one that can still\nbe false, despite the fact that it has all the appearance of truth.\nThis lingering possibility, however, allows the intellect to suspend\nits judgment on the basis of other experiences or reasons. Distinctive\nof such propositions is their contingent nature. Though they can\nappear true, it remains possible that they are false.\n\nThe second degree of certainty associated with evident propositions is\nexemplified by a proposition that not only appears certain and\ninclines the judgment to assent, but is also a proposition that cannot\nfail to signify correctly. According to Wodeham all propositions of\nthis type are categorical and necessary. And, he distinguishes them\nfrom those contingent types of propositions which may have every\nappearance of being true but yet may turn out to be false (LS II:163,\nll.17\u201320).\n\nFinally, Wodeham distinguishes this second type of evident proposition\nfrom a third type of proposition which is also categorical and\nnecessary. This third type of proposition is the highest degree of\nevidence, because, not only can it not fail to appear and be\ntrue, but it also cannot be doubted. That is, it not only inclines to\nassent, but necessitates the intellect to assent. For Wodeham, this is\ndistinct from the second and less-evident type of proposition. While\nthis second type cannot fail to be true, it nevertheless can still be\ndoubted owing to the fact that other conflicting propositions also\nappear to be true. The third type cannot be doubted in this way, no\nmatter what other propositions appear to be true. If other evident\npropositions are genuinely in conflict with (i.e., are inconsistent\nwith) the proposition in question, those propositions cannot be\nevident in the highest degree. But nor can these conflicting\npropositions be evident in the second highest degree since the second\nand third types are both supposed to be necessary. Therefore they\ncannot actually be in conflict, though it is still possible that they\nmay appear to be in conflict. For Wodeham, propositions of the third\nand highest type can be known in themselves and are necessarily\nper se nota (LS I:164, 36).\n",
