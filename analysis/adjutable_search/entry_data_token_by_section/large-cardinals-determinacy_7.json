    "main_text": "Classical Descriptive Set Theory || Basic Notions\n2.2  Basic Notions\n2.2.1  Hierarchies of Definability\n\nIn descriptive set theory it is convenient to work with the\n\u201clogician's reals\u201d, that is, Baire space:\n\u03c9\u03c9. This is the set of all infinite sequences\nof natural numbers (with the product topology (taking \u03c9 as\n discrete)).[9] \n In\nwhat follows, when we write \u2018\u211d\u2019 we shall always mean\n\u2018\u03c9\u03c9\u2019. \n\n We are interested in sets of reals that are\n\u201cdefinable\u201d or \u201cbuilt up from below by simple\noperations.\u201d We shall discuss three central regions of the\nhierarchy of definability\u2014the Borel sets of reals,\nthe projective sets of reals, and the sets of reals\nin L(\u211d). \n\n The Borel sets of reals (or sets of k-tuples of\nreals) are obtained by starting with the closed subsets of\n\u03c9\u03c9 (or\n(\u03c9\u03c9)k for some k <\n\u03c9) and closing under the operations of countable union and\ncountable intersection. This can be described level by level as\nfollows: Let k < \u03c9. At the base level,\nlet \u03a3\u033001\nconsist of the open subsets of\n(\u03c9\u03c9)k and\nlet \u03a0\u033001\nconsist of the closed subsets of\n(\u03c9\u03c9)k. For each ordinal\n\u03b1 such that 0 < \u03b1 < \u03c91, recursively\ndefine \u03a3\u03300\u03b1\nto consist of the sets that are countable unions of sets appearing in\nsome \u03a0\u03300\u03b2,\nfor \u03b2 < \u03b1, and\ndefine \u03a0\u03300\u03b1\nto consist of the sets that are countable intersections of sets\nappearing in\nsome \u03a3\u03300\u03b2,\nfor \u03b2 < \u03b1. The Borel sets of (k-tuples of) reals\nare the sets appearing in this \n hierarchy.[10] \n In 1905 Lebesgue employed Cantor's notion\nof a universal set and technique of diagonalization to show that the\nhierarchy of Borel sets is a proper hierarchy (that is, new\nsets appear at each level). \n\n The projective sets of reals (or sets of k-tuples\nof reals) are obtained by starting with the closed subsets of\n(\u03c9\u03c9)k and iterating the\noperations of complementation and projection. For A \u2286\n(\u03c9\u03c9)k,\nthe complement of A is simply\n(\u03c9\u03c9)k\n\u2212 A. For A \u2286\n(\u03c9\u03c9)k+1,\nthe projection of A is \np[A] = {\u27e8x1,\u2026, xk\u27e9 \u2208 (\u03c9\u03c9)k | \u2203y \u27e8x1,\u2026, xk, y\u27e9 \u2208 A}.\n\n (Think of the case where k + 1 = 3. Here A is a\nsubset of three-dimensional space and p[A] is the result\nof \u201cprojecting\u201d A along the third axis onto the\nplane spanned by the first two axes.)  We can now define the hierarchy\nof projective sets as follows: At the base level,\nlet \u03a3\u033010\nconsist of the open subsets of\n(\u03c9\u03c9)k and\nlet \u03a0\u033010\nconsist of the closed subsets of\n(\u03c9\u03c9)k. For each n such\nthat 0 < n < \u03c9, recursively\ndefine \u03a0\u03301n\nto consist of the complements of sets\nin \u03a3\u03301n,\nand\ndefine \u03a3\u03301n+1\nto consist of the projections of sets\nin \u03a0\u03301n. The\nprojective sets of (k-tuples of) reals are the sets appearing\nin this hierarchy. This hierarchy is also a proper hierarchy, as can\nbe seen using universal sets and diagonalization. \n\n It is useful to also introduce\nthe \u0394\u03301n\nsets. A set of (k-tuples of) reals\nis \u0394\u03301n\niff it is\nboth \u03a3\u03301n\nand \u03a0\u03301n. In\n1917, Suslin showed that the Borel sets are precisely\nthe \u0394\u033011\nsets. Thus, the projective hierarchy extends the Borel hierarchy. \n\n It might seem odd to refer to the above hierarchies as hierarchies\nof definability. However, as the notation indicates, the above\nhierarchies can be recast in terms of definability. For example, the\nprojective sets are exactly the sets which are definable (with\nparameters) in second-order arithmetic. In the\nnotation \u03a3\u03301n,\nthe superscript indicates that we are allowing quantification over\nobjects of second-order (that is, sets of integers (or, equivalently,\nreal numbers)), \u2018\u03a3\u2019 indicates that the starting\nquantifier is existential, the subscript indicates that there\nare n-alternations of quantifiers, and \u2018\u223c\u2019\nindicates that we are allowing real parameters. In the case where real\nparameters are prohibited, the corresponding pointclasses are\ndenoted \u03a31n, \u03a01n,\nand \u03941n. The\nformer hierarchy (where real parameters are allowed) is called\na boldface hierarchy, while the latter (where real parameters\nare prohibited) is called a lightface hierarchy. In a similar\nmanner one can define a lightface version of the Borel\n hierarchy.[11]\n Thus, we really have two hierarchies of definability: the lightface\nhierarchy and the boldface hierarchy. \n\n The projective hierarchy can be extended into the transfinite as\nfollows: For a set X, let Def(X) consist of the subsets\nof X that are definable over X using parameters\nfrom X. This is the definable powerset operation. The\nhierarchy L(\u211d) is the result of starting with \u211d and\niterating the definable powerset operation along the ordinals; more\nprecisely, we let L0(\u211d)\n= V\u03c9+1, L\u03b1+1(\u211d)\n=\nDef(L\u03b1(\u211d)), L\u03bb(\u211d)\n=\n\u22c3\u03b1<\u03bbL\u03b1(\u211d)\nfor limit ordinals \u03bb, and, finally, \nL(\u211d) = \u22c3\u03b1\u2208On L\u03b1(\u211d).\n\n We are interested in the sets of (k-tuples of) reals\nappearing in this hierarchy, that\nis, P((\u03c9\u03c9)k)\n\u2229 L\u03b1(\u211d) for \u03b1 \u2208\nOn. Notice that in the definition of the projective sets,\ncomplementation corresponds to negation and projection corresponds to\nexistential quantification over real numbers. It follows that the\nprojective sets of (k-tuples of) reals are\nexactly P((\u03c9\u03c9)k)\n\u2229 L1(\u211d). Thus, the hierarchy of\nsets P((\u03c9\u03c9)k)\n\u2229 L\u03b1(\u211d) (for \u03b1 \u2208 On) does\nindeed yield a transfinite extension of the projective sets. \n\n One can pass beyond the above hierarchy of sets of reals by\nconsidering richer notions of definability. We shall say little about\nthese stages, except to note that there are natural limits to the\nlightface and boldface hierarchy, namely that of being definable from\nordinal parameters (OD) and that of being definable from ordinal\nparameters and real numbers (OD(\u211d)). To see that the notion\nof ordinal definability is a limiting case of the lightface\nhierarchy notice first that any notion of definability which does not\nrender all of the ordinals definable can be transcended (as can be\nseen by considering the least ordinal which is not definable according\nto the notion) and second that the notion of ordinal definability\ncannot be so transcended (since by reflection OD is ordinal\ndefinable). (Similar considerations apply to the boldface hierarchy.)\nIt is for this reason that G\u00f6del proposed the notion of ordinal\ndefinability as a candidate for an \u201cabsolute\u201d notion of\ndefinability. As a limiting case of the lightface and boldface\nhierarchy we therefore have the sets of reals that are OD and the sets\nof reals that are OD(\u211d), respectively. \n2.2.2  Regularity Properties\n\nThere are many properties shared by \u201cwell-behaved\u201d sets\nof reals. These are called regularity properties. We shall\nconcentrate on the three most central regularity\nproperties\u2014the perfect set property, the property\nof Baire, and Lebesgue measurability. \n\n A set of reals is perfect iff it is nonempty, closed and\ncontains no isolated points. The key feature of this for our purposes\nis that if a set of reals contains a perfect subset then it must have\nthe same size as the continuum (i.e., the reals). A set of reals is\nsaid to have the perfect set property iff it is either\ncountable or contains a perfect subset. The interest of this property\nis that the sets of reals with the perfect set property satisfy CH. In\nearly work, Cantor and Bendixson established (in 1883) that all closed\nsets have the perfect set property. Thus, there is no closed\ncounter-example to the continuum hypothesis. Later, in 1903, Young\nshowed that\nthe \u03a0\u033002\nsets have the perfect set property. A central question was how far\nthis property propagates. Do all of the Borel sets of reals have the\nperfect set property? Do all of the projective sets of reals have the\nperfect set property? \n\n A set of reals is nowhere dense iff its closure under\nlimits contains no open sets. A set of reals is meager iff it\nis the countable union of nowhere dense sets. Finally, a set of\nreals A has the property of Baire iff it is\n\u201calmost open\u201d in the sense that there is an open\nset O such that the region where O and A do not\noverlap (that is, the symmetric difference (O \u2212 A)\n\u222a (A \u2212 O)) is meager. It is straightforward to\nshow that all Borel sets have the property of Baire. Do all of the\nprojective sets have the property of Baire? \n\n The property of Lebesgue measurability is familiar from\nanalysis and here we shall be more brief. To begin with, one\nintroduces a probability measure over sets of reals. A set of reals\nis null iff it has measure zero. A set of reals A\nis Lebesgue measurable iff it is \u201calmost Borel\u201d\nin the sense that there is a Borel set B such that the region\nwhere B and A do not overlap is null. The interest of\nthis notion can perhaps be best brought out by recalling a theorem of\nBanach and Tarski. Banach and Tarski showed that it is possible to cut\nthe unit sphere into finitely many pieces, and shift those pieces\naround (using only translations and rotations) to bring them back\ntogether into a sphere of twice the size. This requires a key\napplication of the Axiom of Choice. It is immediate that such pieces\ncannot be Lebesgue measurable. The question is \u201cHow complex must\nsuch pieces be?\u201d and this amounts to the question \u201cWhich\nsets are Lebesgue measurable?\u201d It is clear that the Borel sets\nare Lebesgue measurable. Are the projective sets Lebesgue\nmeasurable? \n\n In all three cases it is straightforward to use the Axiom of\nChoice to show that there are sets of reals without the regularity\nproperty. The question is whether all definable sets of reals\nhave these properties. \n2.2.3  Structural Properties\n\nThere are many structural properties connected with sets of\nreals\u2014the uniformization property, the separation property, the\nprewellordering property, the basis property, the existence of scales,\nSuslin cardinals, the existence of homogeneous representations,\netc. We shall concentrate on just one such property\u2014the\nuniformization property. \n\n Let A and B be subsets of the plane\n(\u03c9\u03c9)2. A uniformizes B\niff A \u2286 B and for all x \u2208\n\u03c9\u03c9, there exists y such that\n\u27e8x,y\u27e9 \u2208 B iff there is\na unique y such that \u27e8x,y\u27e9\n\u2208 A. In other words, A yields a choice function\nfor B. Using AC it is clear that every set B has a\nuniformizing set A. However, the question of whether\nuniformizations exist becomes interesting when one imposes a\ndefinability constraint. Let \u0393 be a collection of\n(k-tuples of) sets of reals. Such a class is called\na pointclass. The pointclass \u0393 has uniformization\nproperty (Unif(\u0393)) iff every subset of the plane that is in\n\u0393 admits a uniformization that is also in \u0393. \n",
