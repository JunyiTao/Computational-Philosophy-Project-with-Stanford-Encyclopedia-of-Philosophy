    "main_text": "Doxastic Norms || Degrees of reflective access\n2.3 Degrees of reflective access\n\nSo far the norms involved in the ethics of belief have been\ncharacterized without attention to reflective access requirements. A\nreflective access requirement has to do with the\nsubject\u2019s own reflective awareness of some of the relevant\nfacts.\n\nIn order to see how such requirements can play a role, consider the\nfollowing prudential doxastic norm:\n\n(A) If S has end E, and if S's believing\nthat p is likely to make E obtain, then S has a\nprima facie prudential obligation to believe that p.\n\n\nThis is a purely objective or \u2018unreflective\u2019 account of\nthe prudential obligation in question: it is simply concerned with\nwhether the subject in fact has a certain end and whether\nin fact the belief that p is likely to lead to the\naccomplishment of that end. If (A) were the right way to articulate\nobligations in the ethics of belief, then we would have far more\nprima facie doxastic obligations than we realize.\n\nReflective or \u2018subjective\u2019 components can be added to\nnorms in order to make the results more plausible:\n\n(B) If S knows that she has an end\nE, and if S knows that believing that p is\nlikely to make E obtain, then S has a prima facie\nprudential obligation to believe that p.\n\n\n(B) is towards the top of the scale in terms of reflective access\nrequirements: S has to know that he has E and that believing\nthat p is likely to make E obtain . As a sufficient\ncondition for having a doxastic obligation, it may be acceptable, but\nmost ethicists of belief will not want to make the reflective\nknowledge necessary in order for there to be genuine\nprima facie prudential obligations.\n\nIntermediate positions would replace \u201cknows\u201d in one or\nboth parts of the antecedent of (B) with something weaker: \u201cis\nin a position to know,\u201d \u201cjustifiably believes,\u201d\n\u201cis justified in believing,\u201d, believes, and so on.\n\nNote that an ethicist of belief who wants to include a reflective\naccess requirement in a doxastic norm would need to do so in a way\nthat doesn't generate an infinite regress. Note too that the norms we\nconsidered above govern the positive formation of belief. An\naccount of the plausible conditions of reflective access may be\nsomewhat different for norms of maintaining, suspending, and\nrelinquishing belief (for suspending, see Tang 2015 and Perin\n2015).\n",
