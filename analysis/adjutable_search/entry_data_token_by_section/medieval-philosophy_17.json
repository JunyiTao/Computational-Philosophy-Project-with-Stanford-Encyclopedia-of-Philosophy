    "main_text": "When Was Medieval Philosophy?\n5. When Was Medieval Philosophy?\n\nWhereas specialists are mostly agreed, in theory at least, about the\nnew, broad conception of the geography of medieval philosophy, opinion\nabout the period\u2019s chronology remains divided. There is, indeed,\na widespread view (e.g., De Rijk 1985: 1\u201364; Luscombe 1997: 1;\nFlasch 1986 [2000: 27\u201329]; Lagerlund 2020: v) that period\ndivisions are unimportant and are chosen for purely practical reasons\nin order to allow for a division of labour. But, as will emerge below,\nthe choice of period divisions makes a great difference to how the\nhistory of philosophy is written, and arguments can be made from the\ncontinuity and breaks in traditions for different periodizations\n(Marenbon 2011).\n5.1 When Did Medieval Philosophy Begin?\n\nThere are three main points commonly chosen for the beginning of\nmedieval philosophy:\n\nc. 500, a date often chosen by historians for the start of the\nMiddle Ages and corresponding roughly to the end of the Roman Empire\nin the West (the last Emperor was deposed in 476);\nwith the earliest Christian philosophers in the second century\n(but usually omitting the pagan Greek tradition; or\naround 800, because this was the time of both the philosophical\nstirrings at Charlemagne\u2019s court and the start of\nfalsafa in\n Baghdad.[40]\n\n\nThere are problems with each view:\n\nThe justification for c. 500 applies only to Latin philosophy,\nand\nthat for the second century only to Christian philosophy;\nwhile\nignores Greek philosophy and also threatens to leave Latin\nphilosophy between 500 and 800, which historians of classical\nphilosophy disdain, outside consideration.\n\n\nIf the medieval tradition is being envisaged in all four of its main\nbranches, there is some virtue in seeing the point of departure in the\nwork of Plotinus (d. 270) and Porphyry (d. 305?) and including too the\nother Greek pagan material. All four branches are rooted in the\nso-called Platonic Schools, and they took their orientation from these\ntwo philosophers. Of course, historians of ancient philosophy will\nalso want to include some of the thinkers in the earliest centuries of\nthis period in their field, but that is not a problem, because there\nis no reason why periods in the history of philosophy should not\noverlap.\n5.2 When Did Medieval Philosophy End?\n\nMany different answers might be given to this question, but a\nplausible (and to many people surprising) one is: around about 1700,\nexcept that the Arabic tradition, in logic especially, lasted rather\nlonger.\n\nThe Arabic tradition continued, especially in Persia, Turkey and India\nthrough the seventeenth century and, especially in logic (see\n \u00a74.1),\n beyond. The outstanding centre was Safavid Iran, where \u1e62adr\nal-Din Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b (known as\n Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101,\n 1571\u20131636) developed an original system of thought on the basis\nof Avicennian Aristotelianism itself, and as modified by\nSuhraward\u012b, and the mystical ideas of Ibn \u2018Arabi. New\nresearch shows that in the seventeenth century the Ottoman Empire,\ntoo, was the home to innovative philosophizing, sometimes taking the\nearlier Iranian tradition as its starting point (El-Rouayheb\n2015).\n\nThe tradition of Jewish philosophy in Hebrew in Christian Europe\nlargely came to an end with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in\n1492, though it continued for another century in Turkey (see\nTirosh-Samuelson 1997: 529\u2013545). But Jewish philosophy in Europe\ncontinued with the Dialogues of Love by\n Judah Abrabanel,\n known as Leone Ebreo (d. after 1521), preserved and probably written\nin Italian. If, as proposed below, the Latin tradition of medieval\nphilosophy is considered to stretch on until around 1700, then perhaps\n Spinoza\n (1632\u201377), who wrote in Latin and, rarely, in Dutch, an outcast\nfrom his people and a critical admirer of Descartes, but also steeped\nin the thought of Maimonides and \u1e24asdai Crescas, should be\nregarded as the last of the medieval Jewish philosophers.\n\nThe Byzantine tradition was afflicted by the Fall of Constantinople in\n1453, but theological and philosophical speculation in Greek continued\nunder Turkish rule, strongly linked with the earlier tradition, but\ninfluenced by Latin scholastic thinking in the seventeenth century,\nand by new trends in European thinking in the eighteenth (Podskalsky\n1988).\n\nFixing the end point of the Latin medieval tradition is difficult.\nAlthough the traditional and still widespread date of 1500 is often\ntoday said to have no significance, that year has often been chosen by\ngeneral historians to mark the beginning of modern times, as a round\nfigure near to 1492, the date of Columbus\u2019s first voyage to the\nNew World, and 1517, the beginning of the Reformation, which would\ndestroy the apparent unity of Catholic Europe. Many medieval\nhistorians now, however, do not wish to place a boundary at this time\nand stress the continuities in economic and social life that lasted\nuntil the Industrial Revolution. In any case, there is no reason why\nperiodizations in the history of philosophy should coincide with those\nin other areas.\n\nIn many multi-part or multi-volume presentations, Medieval Philosophy\nis followed by Renaissance Philosophy and then by (Early) Modern\nPhilosophy, beginning with Descartes. \u201cRenaissance\nphilosophers\u201d are identified as usually working outside the\nuniversities; many of them enthusiasts for Plato and other ancient\nphilosophers, as well as, or instead of, Aristotle; many eager to\nwrite elegant classical Latin and to learn Greek, and to use literary\nforms such as the dialogue. There was indeed a group of such\nphilosophers, but they do not fit into a chronology that places\nRenaissance Philosophy after Medieval Philosophy: the most famous of\nthem are Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola\n (\u00a72.8),\n neither of whom survived until\n 1500.[41]\n\nUniversity philosophy continued in its established patterns, with some\nimportant changes (such as dropping study of the Metaphysics)\nin Protestant countries, until late in the seventeenth century. In the\nIberian peninsula, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the\nperiod in which philosophical theology, studied in the established\nuniversity manner, flourished (see entry on the\n School of Salamanca).\n The tradition is continuous with the earlier Parisian one, since its\nfounder, Francisco de Vitoria (1486\u20131546) was a pupil of the\nlast of the great Paris University theologians, the Scot John Major\n(1467\u20131550). Among Vitoria\u2019s well-known successors were\nDomingo de Soto (d. 1560), Luis de Molina (d. 1600)\u2014who held\nthat God has a special knowledge of the choices we shall make, but\nthat he does not control these choices, and\n Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n (b. 1548), one of the deepest and most powerful thinkers in the whole\nLatin tradition. One of the few big differences from earlier medieval\nuniversity thinking was the central importance given to Aquinas\n(although Su\u00e1rez was also influenced by Scotus and Ockham),\nwhose Summa Theologiae was now an object of commentary.\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s death in 1617 (more than twenty years\nafter\u00a0Descartes\u2019s birth) does not mark the end of this\nuniversity tradition, but its development into the adventurous\nthought, striking out in new directions in metaphysics and\nmeta-ethics, of until recently forgotten thinkers such as Pedro\nHurtado de Mendoza (d. 1641), his pupil, Rodrigo de Arriaga (d. 1667)\nand Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz (d. 1682).\n\nThe interest of this \u201cbaroque scholasticism\u201d is now\nbeginning to be recognized (see Novotn\u00fd 2009). At the same\ntime, some of the best scholars in the field have written studies that\ndeliberately cut across the usual medieval to modern philosophy\ndivide, looking at metaphysics from 1274 to 1671 (Pasnau 2011) or\ntheories about emotion from 1270 to 1670 (Perler 2011 [2018]). These\napproaches still tend to accept the standard idea that medieval\nphilosophy ended, and modern philosophy began sometime around 1500 or\nat least before 1600, underlining continuities or pleading for the\nexistence of \u201cmedieval philosophy after the Middle\n Ages\u201d.[42]\n A radical suggestion, however, would be to place the ending of\nmedieval Latin philosophy round about 1700 (allowing, of course, for\nan overlap with early modern philosophy), since it was only by then\nthat the effects of the New Science and Cartesianism had worked their\nway into university education and the Aristotelian tradition was\ndisappearing (although by no means everywhere in\n Europe).[43]",
