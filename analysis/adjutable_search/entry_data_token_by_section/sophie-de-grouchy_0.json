    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nMarie-Louise-Sophie de Grouchy, Marquise de Condorcet was born in 1764\nat the Chateau de Meulan. She died in 1822 of an unknown disease. Her\nparents were Marie Gilberte Henriette Fr\u00e9teau de P\u00e9ny\nand Francois-Jacques, Marquis de Grouchy. She was the eldest of four.\nHer sister, Charlotte, married Grouchy\u2019s close friend and\ncollaborator, Pierre-Georges Cabanis. One of her two brothers,\nEmmanuel de Grouchy, Marshall under Napoleon, was reputedly\nresponsible for the French losing at Waterloo because he chose to\nfinish a dish of strawberries before answering a call to battle.\n\nGrouchy was educated at home, benefiting from her brothers\u2019\ntutors and her highly cultured mother\u2019s teachings. At eighteen,\nshe was sent to the Chanoinesse school of Neuville, a convent\nfinishing school for the very rich. There she continued her studies,\nreading Rousseau and Voltaire and learning English and Italian by\ntranslating texts by Edward Young and Torquato Tasso. This is also\nwhere she became an atheist.\n\nAt the age of 22, she married Nicolas, Marquis de Condorcet,\nmathematician and philosopher, who held the post of officer of the\nmint under Turgot. Together they moved to the Hotel of the Mint in\nParis, and there they started a salon, hosting members of the\npolitical and literary international scene.\n\nIn 1791, together with Condorcet, Thomas Paine, the Girondin Brissot,\nand a few others, she started a journal designed to raise awareness of\nrepublican political thought in France. This journal, Le\nR\u00e9publicain, only lasted a few months as Condorcet\ndemanded it be discontinued after the Champ de Mars massacre, at which\nGrouchy and her daughter, Eliza, born in 1790, had been present.\n\nGrouchy contributed several pieces to that publication (unsigned or\nsigned \u201cLa V\u00e9rit\u00e9\u201d\u2014Truth) and she also\ntranslated others by Paine. It was probably around that time that\nGrouchy wrote the first draft of her Letters on Sympathy, a\nresponse to and commentary on Adam Smith\u2019s The Theory of\nMoral Sentiments.\n\nIn 1793, Condorcet was added to a list of men and women who were\n\u201cproscribed\u201d by the government of the Terror and had to go\ninto hiding to evade arrest. Condorcet remained in hiding until spring\nof 1794 when he attempted to run and died under an assumed name in a\nsmall town outside Paris. During his time in hiding, he completed the\nintroduction to a encyclopedic work on the progress of humanity which\nhe had started several decades earlier. There is evidence that Grouchy\nhelped him with this work during her frequent visits. At the very\nleast, she edited an incomplete manuscript, adding several passages\nwhich were deleted by a later editor.\n\nAfter Condorcet\u2019s death, Grouchy, whose wealth had been\nconfiscated, lived by painting miniature portraits. By the time the\nTerror was over, she decided to publish her Letters on\nSympathy, addressed to her her brother-in-law, Cabanis, together\nwith a translation of Adam Smith\u2019s The Theory of Moral\nSentiments which greatly surpassed existing translations.\n\nFrom 1795 until her death in 1822, she dedicated her writing time to\nediting her husband\u2019s works. She continued to participate in\nFrance\u2019s philosophical life through her salon and kept in\nregular touch with Cabanis who worked on physiology and later,\nStoicism.\n",
