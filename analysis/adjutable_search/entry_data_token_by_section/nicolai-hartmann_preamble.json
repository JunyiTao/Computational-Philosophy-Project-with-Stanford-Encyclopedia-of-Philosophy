    "main_text": "\n\nNicolai Hartmann (1882\u20131950) was one of the leading German\nphilosophers of the first half of the twentieth century. Originally a\nstudent of Marburg Neo-Kantianism, Hartmann departed from this\ntradition and spearheaded the resurgence of ontology in the early\ntwentieth century. Hartmann was in many respects a classical\nphilosopher and wrote book-length works scrutinizing and developing\nall the major fields of philosophy, including the philosophy of\nhistory, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics, although his chief\ninterest was ontology. He held teaching posts in Marburg, K\u00f6ln,\nBerlin, and G\u00f6ttingen, was president of the German Philosophical\nAssociation after the second World War, and had a major influence on a\ngeneration of German philosophers through his ongoing discussion\ngroups. Hartmann discouraged discipleship by inviting students to\nthink through problems for themselves. Over the last twenty years,\nafter a long period of neglect, his work has been attracting more\nattention by an international group of scholars. Perhaps unique in the\nearly twentieth century, Hartmann developed a pluralistic, humanistic\nrealism that attempted to do justice to both the sciences and the\nhumanities. Hartmann may be regarded as the first genuine ontological\npluralist of the twentieth century.\n",
