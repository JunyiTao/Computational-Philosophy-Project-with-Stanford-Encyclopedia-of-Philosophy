    "main_text": "Peirce: Basing the Algebra of Logic on Subsumption\n5. Peirce: Basing the Algebra of Logic on Subsumption\n\nPeirce started his research into the algebra of logic in the late\n1860s. In his paper \u201cOn an Improvement in Boole\u2019s calculus of\nLogic\u201d (Peirce 1867), he arrived independently at the same\nconclusion that Jevons had reached earlier, that one needed to replace\nBoole\u2019s partial operation of addition with the total operation of\nunion (see CP 3.3.6). In his important 1880 paper, \u201cOn the\nAlgebra of Logic\u201d, Peirce quietly broke with the traditional\nextensional semantics and introduced a usual assumption of modern\nsemantics: the extension of a concept, understood as a class, could be\nempty (as well as the universe), and stated the truth values of the\ncategorical propositions that we use today. For example, he said the\nproposition \u201cAll \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\u201d is true if \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are both the empty class. Conversion by Limitation, that is, the\nargument \u201cAll \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\u201d therefore \u201cSome \\(B\\)\nis \\(A\\)\u201d, was no longer a valid inference. Peirce said nothing\nabout the reasons for and merits of his departure from the traditional\nsemantic assumption of existence.\n\nPeirce also broke with Boole\u2019s and Jevons\u2019 use of equality as the\nfundamental primitive, using instead the relation of\n\u201csubsumption\u201d interpretable in different ways (subclass\nrelation, implication, etc.). He stated the partial order properties\nof subsumption and then proceeded to define the operations of + and\n\u00d7 as least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds\u2014he\nimplicitly assumed such bounds existed\u2014and listed the key\nequational properties of the algebras with two binary operations that\nwe now call lattices. Then he claimed that the distributive law\nfollowed, but said the proof was too tedious to include. The\nfruitfulness of this perspective is evident in his seminal paper from\n1885. There Peirce introduced a system for propositional logic based\non five axioms for implication (represented by the sign\n\u2018\\(-\\kern-.4em<\\)\u2019), including what is now called\nPeirce\u2019s law. It certainly made the algebra of logic more elegant.\n",
