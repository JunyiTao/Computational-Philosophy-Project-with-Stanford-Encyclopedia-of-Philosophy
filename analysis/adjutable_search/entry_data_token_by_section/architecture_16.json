Architectural Ethics\nSome problems of architectural ethics are characteristic of a range\nof typical moral dilemmas\u2014agent-centered, norms-oriented\nconcerns\u2014as may arise for architects. In addition to a\ntraditional set of questions applied to the architectural domain,\narchitectural ethics also addresses problems special to the discipline\nand practice\u2014as shaped by its social, public, practical, and\nartistic nature. \nAs conceptually prior to a normative ethics of architectural\npractice, a meta-ethics of architecture assesses alternate ethical\nmodalities, such as whether architecture might be considered moral or\nimmoral relative to its objects (built structures) or to its practices\nas a set of institutions or social phenomena. Another meta-ethical\nissue concerns whether moralism or autonomism best characterizes the\nrelationship of aesthetics to ethics, as that plays out in\narchitecture.\nEthical modalities of architecture. There are\nthree typical candidate modalities of ethics in architecture. For one,\nthere is the establishment of criteria for ethical norms of the\nenterprise such as architects in practice may observe. For example,\narchitects can craft designs in ways that lower the likelihood of cost\noverruns and enhance safety. In an interpersonal vein, architects can\nrepresent their work honestly to clients or contractors. Another\nmodality\u2014beyond enterprise-defined ethical norms\u2014is\npursuit of criteria to gauge architects as moral agents broadly\nproducing or doing good or bad in the world. For example, architects\nmay create objects that uplift or constrain individual users and\ninhabitants; other architects may promote social utility by designing\nhousing for those in need of shelter. Finally, there is the modality\nof seeking criteria to judge architectural objects as morally good or\nbad insofar as they directly produce pleasure or pain. As an\nindirect example, a hospital design is intended to facilitate\nthe minimizing of pain, by fostering environmental conditions\nconducive to excellence in health care and patient well-being. As a\nmore direct case, a bus shelter is intended to reduce exposure to the\nelements and corresponding discomfort. This last candidate may be\nattractive if we see architecture primarily as a product rather than\nas a practice; it is noxious if we are unwilling to assign moral\nvalues to artifacts as we do to actions or their properties. A built\nstructure might be inhumane in that it is bleak or uninhabitable,\nthough it does not follow that the structure itself bears inhumane\nvalues. \nValue Interaction. Vitruvian principles underlying\nmuch of architectural theory suggest a tendency to link the aesthetic\nand the utility-promoting. So, too, functional beauty theory\nrecommends that aesthetic and ethical considerations are linked in\narchitecture. To crystallize the matter, we may ask if it is possible\nfor a built structure to be good though not aesthetically so. The\nquestion as to how aesthetic and ethical value might be related is a\nsubject of broader concern, with a \u201cmoralist\u201d stance that\nsays the two sorts of value are or should be connected (Carroll 1996,\nGaut 1998) and an \u201cautonomist\u201d stance that takes the two\nas (or better off as) independent (Anderson and Dean 1998, Kieran\n2001).\nIn this debate, architecture would seem a promising domain in which\nto find robust relations. At a moralist extreme, there is the\nsuggestion\u2014supported by some traditions in architectural theory\n(Pugin 1841, Ruskin 1849)\u2014that aesthetic tasks in architecture\nsimply are ethical tasks, reflecting ethical choices.  One\nprominent moralist perspective locates the ethical element of\naesthetic architectural choice in obligations to a sort of honesty, in\ndesigning works that accurately represent underlying structural\nprinciples or operational capacities. Harries (1997) and Scruton\n(1979/2013) arrive at similar ethical commitments to architectural\ndesign as expressive in a particular fashion, though of shared\ncommunity values, rather than of function or structural features.\nFrom another angle, moralists point to the emotional impact of built\nenvironments as indicative of a union of the aesthetically gripping\nand morally compelling (Ginsburg 1994), though it may be noted that\neven where we detect such a union we need not judge the aesthetics of\nthe architectural object on the basis of any ethical import so\ncommunicated.\nAt the other extreme, autonomists propose that problems of ethics\nand aesthetics neither need arise at once, nor need be resolved at\nonce, in architectural design. If we see a correlation in some\narchitectural objects of ethically and aesthetically compelling design\nsolutions, we see in other objects no correlation at all. Thus, the\nmodern city is replete with instances of built structures that are\nwell-functioning, high-utility, and facilitate much good in the world\nyet meet no one\u2019s standards of aesthetically worthy design.\nThere is good reason to uncouple these values just in case they\nmust conflict. Suppose there is an ethical premium, for\nexample, on the need to create environmentally sustaining structures,\nand that we identify resolutions of that problem as generally bearing\nthe greatest mark of moral worth. Suppose further that crafting the\noptimal moral solution (vis-\u00e0-vis the environment)\nalways generates the most unattractive design\u2014and that the\ninverse holds as well (the better the design aesthetically, the worse\nthe design for the environment). Then a connection between ethics and\naesthetics in architecture seems improbable.\nA third position altogether proposes a pluralism. Sometimes ethical\nand aesthetic value march hand-in-hand, other times not\u2014and\ntheir ways of matching up are diverse and run in various\ndirections. So one architectural design may be aesthetically\ncompelling as it reflects its ethically upstanding character, whereas\nanother design may be aesthetically compelling as it reflects its\nethically deficient character. What is required for cases of this last\nsort is that the evaluator can identify the aesthetic success as\ngrounded, per functional beauty theory, in effective\nexpression of the structure\u2019s ethically deficient function\n(Sauchelli 2012b).  An even more generalized pluralism would suggest\nthat a wide range of aesthetic and ethical valences can be matched up\nin different ways; we might value a war memorial for the way it grimly\nexpresses the horrors of war.\nTraditional questions of architectural ethics. One\nreason that architectural ethics is central to philosophy of\narchitecture is that architects\u2019 actions bear great influence\nover other people\u2019s moral lives. Architects design structures\nand environments for people, with concomitant effects on personal\nbehavior, capacity to choose courses of action, and ability to satisfy\npreferences, visit harm, generate benefit, or exercise rights. As\narchitects\u2019 acts shape spaces, boundaries, and pathways that\nstructure individual behaviors and social acts, they prompt normative\nethical exploration along traditional lines.\nTo begin with, a traditional architectural ethics requires an\naccount of architectural responsibilities. Any such account\nshould outline architects\u2019 obligations to other persons, ethical\nstandards on which such obligations may be based, how to ensure such\nstandards might be met, and any other sorts of obligations architects\nmight have, as for example, to historic preservation or environmental\nprotection. As concerns obligations to persons, the range of\nstakeholders in architecture is great, hence ethical responsibility is\ndiffuse.\nA further set of questions concerns rights.  It is\nrelatively novel to speak of authorial or community rights in\narchitecture; owner or client rights are historically parasitic on\nproperty or sovereign rights. Other possibilities include rights of\ndevelopers, builders, engineers, environments, and societies.  As that\nlist grows, two further questions concern the sorts of rights that can\nbe attributed to such parties or entities, and the criteria for\ndistributing and prioritizing them given aesthetic as well as moral\nconsiderations.\nArchitectural utility is familiar as a Vitruvian concept\nbut has a wholly other sense in an agent-centered normative ethics,\nwith a possible moral weighting not found in classic architectural\ntheory. Guidelines are needed to determine the usefulness of\narchitectural goods such as built structures, restorations,\nreconstructions, or plans. These might include their social character,\nor individual preferences of the architect, owner, end-users, or\npublic. A utilitarian approach to architectural ethics is attractive\nin capturing the aims of architecture to promote well-being, and\nrelying on a ready marker of architectural value. However, it also\ndiscounts other traditional architectural imperatives such as a\nVitruvian-style pluralist may honor, including beauty and structural\nintegrity (Spector 2001). \nFinally, a traditionalist picture of architectural ethics requires\nan account of virtues in the domain (though these may be\northogonal to normative ethics). Here is potential consonance with the\nVitruvian tradition (and similarly virtue-oriented non-Western\ntraditions)\u2014if we see the \u201cgood\u201d, morally educated\narchitect\u2019s virtue and character as our best guarantee of proper\nand productive weighting of values under differing circumstances\n(Spector 2001).\nFuture-Focused Architectural Ethics. The focus of\nethical rights and responsibilities in architecture is typically taken\nas relative to present or past. Thus, we speak of obligations to\ndesign and build in ethically responsible fashion, or preserve past\narchitectural objects. There are future-focused obligations, as\nwell. Sustainable design is forward-looking even as it is centered on\nwhat we design and build today. Further ethical issues may arise\nrelative to future architectural objects. As to obligations to future\narchitectural objects, we see as much in the short-term\ninstance of planning around near-future buildings. More puzzling is\nwhether we might have \u201clong-haul\u201d future-facing\nobligations\u2014apart from utility or prudential\nconsiderations\u2014in planning, for example, new cities or\naccommodations to climate change.\nSpecial ethical questions of architecture.\nArchitectural practice generates special moral issues as befit its\nproper, idiosyncratic features, distinctive among the arts, the\nprofessions, and social practices. Most notably, an array of ethical\nissues of social import arises from architecture\u2019s commitments\nto creation of a socially beneficial and functional art. Such issues\ninclude the nature of \u201cbetter\u201d housing (and under varying\nconditions), what (if anything) makes housing an obligation, and ways\nthat such an obligation may accrue to, or be satisfied by,\narchitects. Yet other ethical issues special to architecture range\nover matters of personal and social spaces and the articulations\nthereof, including criteria for designing around concerns related to\nprivacy, accessibility (for the public generally and handicapped in\nparticular), respecting community and neighborly preferences, and\npromoting civic values.\nOther ethical matters special to architecture are particularly\nvisible in global perspective. For example, there is inequitable\ndistribution of housing across the developed and developing nations,\nand part of the solution may be architectural (Caicco 2005).  Further,\narchitecture incurs special environmental obligations given that waste\nand degradation affect, and are affected by, architectural design. One\nconceptual challenge of sustainability facing architects is to\ndetermine whether development is, in principle, a countervailing\ninterest. This is to ask, once environmental obligations are defined,\nhow they may be factored into or weighed against infrastructural and\ndesign interests and preferences.\nProfessional Ethics. Architectural professional\nethics focuses on architects\u2019 moral choices in the context of\npractice (Wasserman, Sullivan, and Palermo 2000; T. Fisher\n2010). Professional ethical codes govern conduct in (and thereby\nprotect) the architectural profession and avert problems related to\nbusiness, fiduciary, insurance, or liability functions; the design\nfunction is an ethical focus relative to disability. Architectural law\nhighlights professional ethics matters as concern property, liability,\nand honesty. The law clarifies responsibilities among parties to\narchitectural practice; defines who or what in commercial\narchitectural interactions has moral agency\u2014hence rights; and\ndescribes utility-wise or financial measures of distribution in\narchitecture.  Legal regulations and judgments prompt conceptual\nquestions regarding such issues as intellectual property in\narchitecture, architects as arbitrators, and architects\u2019\nresponsibilities to others (S. Fisher 2000a).\nIntellectual Property.  One conceptual issue concerning\narchitectural intellectual property is how such rights are to be\nweighed against other sorts of property rights, such as domestic or\ncommercial rights. A further issue is determined on the basis of\njudging architecture to be a service or product. Taking architecture\nas service means that architects do not have a stake on\ncopyright, as they would then be creators-by-contract; tradition has\nit that rights to expression of ideas so created accrue to the\ncontracting party. Taking architecture as product supports\narchitects\u2019 claim to copyright, given that expression is their\ncreation\u2014whatever services are performed (Greenstreet 1998;\nCushman and Hedemann 1995). Copyright raises other concerns. Even as\nthe law may license creation of an architectural object reflecting\ncore design aspects found in another object created by a different\narchitect, we may find morally blameworthy any cognizant\n\u201cborrowing\u201d without attribution or\npermission. Alternatively, we might view this as a routine episode in\nthe history of architectural copying without attribution or\npermission. The challenge is to define relevant obligations of one\narchitect to others, present or past.\nArchitect as judge in owner-contractor disputes.\nArchitects have a dual role, serving as designer and administrator of\narchitectural projects, and in this capacity may adjudicate between\nowner and contractor in matters of dispute.  Standard issues concern\nconflicts of interest, grounds for adjudication, and criteria of\nfairness. Ethical issues of a particularly architectural\nstripe include the degree to which specifications are poorly satisfied\nsuch as warrants reckoning; maintenance of fealty to owners\u2019\ninterests alongside fairness to contractors and to satisfactory\nrealization of one\u2019s own design; and identification of virtues\nappropriate to judgment in design-related disputes, along with facets\nof being an architect that promote (or limit) such virtues.\nResponsibility to others\u2019 design. Architectural\nobjects often develop over time in cumulative and mutable fashion,\nthrough additions and alterations that\u2014perhaps more frequently\nthan not\u2014change the design of a different, original architect\n(or that of a prior alteration). For any particular changes, or in\nconsideration of design changes overall, we may stipulate obligations\nto respect original or prior intent and execution. One brand of such\nobligations, recognized in historic preservation and landmark laws,\nrequires that aesthetic concerns in the public interest trump private\ninterests. Key conceptual questions concern how to determine the\nsource and conditions of any such obligations\u2014and the sorts of\nresponsibilities architects should have to existing structures. Those\nresponsibilities may extend to commitment to the integrity of work by\nfellow architects.\n",
