    "main_text": "Work\n2. Work\n\n\nFicino\u2019s wide ranging conception of what it meant to practice, rather\nthan only to theorize about, philosophy inflected his entire career,\nmarked as it was by a series of works, from translations, to letters,\nto philosophical treatises. Ficino\u2019s initial activity, in the late 1450s, included short\ntreatises, mostly epistolary, on certain basic philosophical\nmatters. The 1460s saw him come into his own as a translator; these\nyears also represent the beginnings of his work as a commentator and\nexegete. In 1464, when Cosimo de\u2019 Medici was in the final stages of\nhis life, Ficino read to him his new translations of certain Platonic\ndialogues (some of which are now considered spurious). And it is\nnoteworthy that, by this point in the fifteenth century, Platonic\nsources seemed suitable for traditional, Christian end of life\npreparation; admittedly it is Ficino\u2019s own much later account from\nwhich this story is drawn, but he would hardly have mentioned it had\nsuch a scenario been wholly implausible (Hankins 1989,\n267\u201368). As that decade wore on Ficino authored commentaries on\nand summaries of Plato\u2019s writings, many of which he continued to work\non for the rest of his career; these included\nthe Timaeus, Phaedrus,\nSymposium (less a commentary and more of a free-standing\ndialogue), and the Philebus.\n",
