Recent literature has seen a number of games whose design is\nconnected to logic, yet they are not meant to analyze logical notions\nper se. Many of these games are played on graphs, as underlying game\nboards where players can perform different moves. Graph games are\nwidely used in the computational literature for analyzing logical and\nalgorithmic tasks ( Flum, Gr\u00e4del &\nWilke 2007). However, in this section, we merely highlight one\nparticular kind of graph game for its fruitful connections with logic\nwhich suggests a number of unusual issues.\n\nExample Sabotage Games.\n\nSabotage games were proposed to analyze algorithmic tasks in adverse\ncircumstances. Consider the below network between some European\ncities:\n\n\n\nFigure 24.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nIt is easy to travel either way between Amsterdam and the German town\nof Saarbruecken. Now, let a malevolent Demon start canceling\nconnections in the network. At every stage, let the Demon take out one\nlink, while the Traveler can afterwards follow one of the remaining\nlinks. This turns a one-agent planning problem into a two-player\nsabotage game. Zermelo-style reasoning shows that, from Saarbruecken,\na German Traveler still has a winning strategy, while in Amsterdam,\nthe Demon has the winning strategy against the Dutch Traveler, by\nfirst cutting a link close to Saarbruecken. The symmetry of the\noriginal search problem is broken.\n\nThe sabotage game has been applied to a variety of scenarios,\nincluding learning (Gierasimczuk, Kurzen, &\nVel\u00e1zquez-Quesada 2009), and communication networks\n(Aucher, van Benthem, & Grossi\n2018). On finite graphs, the game is clearly determined, with\nthe computational complexity of identifying who has a winning strategy\nbeing Pspace-complete (L\u00f6ding & Rohde\n2003).\n\nThe existence of this winning strategy can be expressed by a\nfirst-order formula. More specifically, winning conditions can be\ndefined in a bimodal logic that combines a standard modality for\ntravel steps with a new modality for one-step arrow deletion,\ninterpreted in models \\(M = (W, R, V)\\):\n\n\\(M, s \\vDash [{-}]\\varphi\\quad\\) For each edge \\((u, v)\\) in \\(R:\\,\n\\, (W, R {-} \\{(u. v)\\}, V) \\vDash \\varphi\\)\n\nThis logic fits the sabotage game closely. On top, it is a natural\nfragment of the first-order language of graphs. Surprisingly, this\nlogic is undecidable (L\u00f6ding & Rohde\n2003), making it one of the simplest examples of an undecidable\nmodal logic over arbitrary models.\n\nFurther graph games in a similar spirit exist, including the poison\ngame of Duchet and Meyniel (1993), where\nthe Demon poisons nodes, rather than deleting edges. Extensive studies\nof modal logics for changing graphs, and \u03bc-calculi for defining\ngeneric solutions to graph games are given in Areces,\nFigueira et al. (2011); Areces, Fervari, and\nHoffmann (2015); and Aucher, van Benthem & Grossi (2018). A\nclassification of graph games including the effects of complex goal\nformulas and imperfect information is found in van\nBenthem and Liu (2019).\n\nOne perspective on such logics for reasoning about model change is the\nsemantic games approach of\n Section 6.1.\n In standard evaluation games, the initial model does not change.\nModalities for model change, however, require a process of formula\nevaluation where the model of evaluation changes as, say, witnesses\nfor quantifiers are not replaced (unlike in standard semantics for\nfirst-order logic), or moves change facts by causing damage to\naccessibility relations. In other contexts, similar modalities are\njustified by physical measurements that change the phenomenon under\ninvestigation, (Hintikka 2002; Renardel 2001;\n\u00c5gotnes & W\u00e1ng 2017), while another natural\nexample are the dynamic-epistemic logics for information update\nmentioned in the discussion of game play (Baltag & Renne 2016). Such generalized form of semantics\nare of independent logical interest.\n\nExample Knowledge Games.\n\nNew logical games also arise naturally within the dynamics of\ninformation, knowledge or belief as triggered by the process of game\nplay (cf.\n Section 4).\n In particular, information update suggests conversation games between\nparticipants with similar or different goals. These games may be\ncooperative, with players aiming to pool their information, thereby\nturning distributed knowledge into common knowledge (Meyer\n& van der Hoek 1995). But they can\nalso be competitive, say, when players strive to be the first to know\nwhether some relevant proposition holds. Mixtures between both modes\nalso occur, for instance with some players aiming to communicate a\nfact that outsiders should not learn about (van\nDitmarsch 2003).\n\nA concrete example are the \u2018announcement games\u2019 of \u00c5gotnes\nand van Ditmarsch (2011).\nPlayers speak simultaneously and only once, while pursuing goal that\nare specified as epistemic formulas. Speaking is modeled by public\nannouncement, and players preferences are binary. They prefer final\nmodels where their goal formula holds over those where it is\nfalse.\n\nThese games are conducted under imperfect information, as players may\nnot know the true state of their epistemic model. Accordingly, the\nrelevant strategies need to be uniform. Players must say the same\nthing in all states they cannot distinguish. In general, then, many\nsolution concepts produce mixed strategy outcomes. In fact, it can be\nshown that there exists simple announcement games without any unique\nequilibrium in pure strategies. However, there is a relevant role for\nlogic to play. Suppose that the goal statements are all\n\u2018universal\u2019, i.e., constructed from literals by applying\nonly conjunction, disjunction, knowledge operators, and dynamic\nmodalities with universal announcements. Truth of such formulas is\npreserved when transitioning from a model to a submodel. Consequently,\nepistemic uncertainty becomes less harmful and knowledge games with\nuniversal goals have equilibria in pure strategies. Recently,\nknowledge games have been expanded further to include both questions\nand answers as separate actions of issue change and information change\n(\u00c5gotnes, van Benthem et al.\n2012).\n\nExample Boolean games.\n\nA third example of game design in between game logics and logic games\nare the Boolean games of Harrenstein et al.\n(2001) and Gutierrez, Harrenstein, and\nWooldridge (2015) that have been mentioned several times\nalready. Each player is handed control over a subset of the\npropositional variables, and can pick truth values for these at will.\nUsing goals specified in temporal logics, these games can model a\nlarge number of relevant scenarios of agency. By now, a growing body\nof work addresses various aspects of Boolean games including their\ncomputational characteristics (both single-shot and iterated), their\ngame-theoretic properties and equilibria (Gutierrez,\nHarrenstein, & Wooldridge\n2015), and their connections with games played on social\nnetworks (Seligman & Thompson 2015).\nFurther discussion can be found in the entry on\n coalitional powers.\n",
