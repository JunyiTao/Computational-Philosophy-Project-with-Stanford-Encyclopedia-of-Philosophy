    "main_text": "\n\nThe St. Petersburg paradox was introduced by Nicolaus Bernoulli in\n1713. It continues to be a reliable source for new puzzles and\ninsights in decision theory.\n\nThe standard version of the St. Petersburg paradox is derived from the\nSt. Petersburg game, which is played as follows: A fair coin is\nflipped until it comes up heads the first time. At that point the\nplayer wins \\(\\$2^n,\\) where n is the number of times the coin\nwas flipped. How much should one be willing to pay for playing this\ngame? Decision theorists advise us to apply the principle of\nmaximizing expected value. According to this principle, the value of\nan uncertain prospect is the sum total obtained by multiplying the\nvalue of each possible outcome with its probability and then adding up\nall the terms (see the entry on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility).\n In the St. Petersburg game the monetary values of the outcomes and\ntheir probabilities are easy to determine. If the coin lands heads on\nthe first flip you win $2, if it lands heads on the second flip you\nwin $4, and if this happens on the third flip you win $8, and so on.\nThe probabilities of the outcomes are \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\),\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\), \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\),\u2026. Therefore, the expected\nmonetary value of the St. Petersburg game is \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 4 + \\frac{1}{8}\\cdot 8 + \\cdots &= 1+1+1+ \\cdots \\\\\n&= \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\cdot 2^n \\\\\n&= \\infty.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n(Some would say that the sum approaches infinity, not that it\nis infinite. We will discuss this distinction in\n Section 2.)\n\nThe \u201cparadox\u201d consists in the fact that our best theory of\nrational choice seems to entail that it would be rational to pay\nany finite fee for a single opportunity to play the St.\nPetersburg game, even though it is almost certain that the player will\nwin a very modest amount. The probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) that the\nplayer wins no more than $2, and \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) that he or she wins\nno more than $4.\n\nIn a strict logical sense, the St. Petersburg paradox is not a paradox\nbecause no formal contradiction is derived. However, to claim that a\nrational agent should pay millions, or even billions, for playing this\ngame seems absurd. So it seems that we, at the very least, have a\ncounterexample to the principle of maximizing expected value. If\nrationality forces us to liquidate all our assets for a single\nopportunity to play the St. Petersburg game, then it seems unappealing\nto be rational.\n",
