Nei-wai \u5167\u5916 and Gendered Differentiation\n\nSince being a man or a woman is concomitant with one\u2019s\nembodiment of familial/social roles through ritual learnings, the\ninterrogation of how these roles are inscribed ritually would be a\nmuch more fruitful way into the study of gender in Confucian\nphilosophy. Ritualization marks not only the beginning of the process\nof genderization, but more fundamentally the beginning of\nhumanity/civility. The concept of xing \u6027\u2014a\nstand-in for human nature or animal nature\u2014is not what sets one\nclass of people apart from the other, or humans from\n animals.[2]\n As Confucius said in the Analects, \u201cBy nature we are\nsimilar; learned habits set us apart\u201d (17.2; for other\ntranslations see Ames & Rosemont 1998). Similarly, according to\nthe Xunzi,\n\n\nAs regards to raw material, nature, awareness and capability,\njunzi and petty persons are equal [\u2026] Rather, it is\nthe way they employ these to make decisions make them different.\n(Xunzi 4.9; for other translations see Knoblock & Zhang\n1999)\n\n\nSages and the rest of us are of the same kind (lei \u985e),\nand there is little distinguishing difference between humans\n(ren \u4eba) and birds/beasts (qinshou\n\u79bd\u7378), since raw materials and in-born propensities are\npossessed in common by humans and animals\n alike.[3]\n Ritual (li \u79ae) differentiation (bie \u522b)\nis that slight differentiation separating humans from animals.\nAccording to the Xunzi,\n\n\nThe reason why humans are human is [\u2026] because they have the\nability to make distinctions. Whereas birds/beasts have father and\nson, they don\u2019t have the affection between father and son; and\nwhereas birds/beasts have male and female (pinmu\n\u725d\u7261), they don\u2019t have the differentiation between\nman and woman (nann\u00fc \u7537\u5973). Hence, the way\nof humanity cannot be without distinctions. (Xunzi 5.9)\n\n\nThe most important distinction that humans make, as the same passage\ngoes on to say, is ritual differentiation (Xunzi 5.10).\n",
