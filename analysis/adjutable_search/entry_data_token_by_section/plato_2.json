    "main_text": "Dialogue, setting, character\n3. Dialogue, setting, character\n\nThere is another feature of Plato\u2019s writings that makes him\ndistinctive among the great philosophers and colors our experience of\nhim as an author. Nearly everything he wrote takes the form of a\ndialogue. (There is one striking exception: his Apology,\nwhich purports to be the speech that Socrates gave in his\ndefense\u2014the Greek word apologia means\n\u201cdefense\u201d\u2014when, in 399, he was legally charged and\nconvicted of the crime of impiety. However, even there, Socrates is\npresented at one point addressing questions of a philosophical\ncharacter to his accuser, Meletus, and responding to them. In\naddition, since antiquity, a collection of 13 letters has been\nincluded among his collected works, but their authenticity as\ncompositions of Plato is not universally accepted among scholars, and\nmany or most of them are almost certainly not his (see Burnyeat and\nFrede 2015). Most of them purport to be the outcome of his involvement\nin the politics of Syracuse, a heavily populated Greek city located in\nSicily and ruled by tyrants.)\n\nWe are of course familiar with the dialogue form through our\nacquaintance with the literary genre of drama. But Plato\u2019s\ndialogues do not try to create a fictional world for the purposes of\ntelling a story, as many literary dramas do; nor do they invoke an\nearlier mythical realm, like the creations of the great Greek\ntragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Nor are they all\npresented in the form of a drama: in many of them, a single speaker\nnarrates events in which he participated. They are philosophical\ndiscussions\u2014\u201cdebates\u201d would, in some cases, also be\nan appropriate word\u2014among a small number of interlocutors, many\nof whom can be identified as real historical figures (see Nails 2002);\nand often they begin with a depiction of the setting of the\ndiscussion\u2014a visit to a prison, a wealthy man\u2019s house, a\ncelebration over drinks, a religious festival, a visit to the\ngymnasium, a stroll outside the city\u2019s wall, a long walk on a\nhot day. As a group, they form vivid portraits of a social world, and\nare not purely intellectual exchanges between characterless and\nsocially unmarked speakers. (At any rate, that is true of a large\nnumber of Plato\u2019s interlocutors. However, it must be added that\nin some of his works the speakers display little or no character. See,\nfor example, Sophist and Statesman\u2014dialogues\nin which a visitor from the town of Elea in Southern Italy leads the\ndiscussion; and Laws, a discussion between an unnamed\nAthenian and two named fictional characters, one from Crete and the\nother from Sparta.) In many of his dialogues (though not\nall), Plato is not only attempting to draw his readers into a\ndiscussion, but is also commenting on the social milieu that he is\ndepicting, and criticizing the character and ways of life of his\ninterlocutors (see Blondell 2002). Some of the dialogues that most\nevidently fall into this category are Protagoras,\nGorgias, Hippias Major, Euthydemus, and\nSymposium.\n",
