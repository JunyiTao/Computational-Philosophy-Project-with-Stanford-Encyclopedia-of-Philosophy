    "main_text": "Philosophical Foundations\n2. Philosophical Foundations\n\nPreliminary to the analysis of existing legal systems and the\nconstruction of the utilitarian pannomion, in 1776 Bentham\nbegan drafting \u201cPreparatory Principles\u201d (of censorial\njurisprudence or what the law ought to be). In these over 600 pages of\nmanuscript, now published in authoritative form in the Collected\nWorks (2016b), he offered a series of disquisitions on the\ndefinitions, distinctions, axioms, and aphorisms intended as tools for\ndemystifying the \u201cfictions\u201d of English law and legal\npractice, fictions which he found uncritically reiterated in\nBlackstone\u2019s Commentaries. In these and other early\nwritings we see Bentham striving to emulate in the moral world the\ngreat advances made in physical science. In the process he consciously\nallied himself with the more progressive elements of the Enlightenment\nand made plain the intellectual influences that shaped his thought,\nnotably Bacon, Locke, Hume, and the French philosophes.\n\nInfluenced by the empiricism of Bacon and Locke, Bentham held that all\nknowledge is derived from sensation: the intellect has no material to\nwork with apart from that obtained by the senses. In the second half\nof the 17th century, the Royal Society had emphasized the\nrole of experiment and empiricist epistemology in the development of\nthe natural sciences. Suitably impressed by the progress made in this\ndepartment of knowledge, Bentham carried over into moral science the\nbasic principle that people can only know, in any certain or\nscientific sense of that term, that which can be observed and\nverified. He argued that legal science ought to be built on the same\nimmovable basis of sensation and experience as that of medicine,\ndeclaring \u201cwhat the physician is to the natural body, the\nlegislator is to the political: legislation is the art of medicine\nexercised upon a grand scale\u201d (UC xxxii, 168).\n\nThis was the core of the \u201cexperimental method\u201d for\nBentham; it was an approach implicitly associated in his mind with a\nmaterialist ontology and a representational theory of meaning. He\nrejected all forms of idealism in philosophy and insisted that in\nprinciple all matter is quantifiable in mathematical terms, and this\nextends to the pains and pleasures that we experience\u2014the\nultimate phenomena to which all human activity (and social concepts,\nsuch as rights and duty) could be reduced and explained.\n\nIn Bentham\u2019s theory of language general terms have no\ncorresponding reality: words, ideas and propositions must represent or\ndescribe \u201creal entities\u201d, which may be either\n\u201cperceptions\u201d or \u201csubstances\u201d (UC lxix,\n62\u201363), otherwise they are \u201cfictitious entities\u201d.\nThis was a distinction Bentham learnt from d\u2019Alembert\n(1838\u201343, III, 286), though he turned it to a more radical\nontological purpose. He defined a fictitious entity as \u201ca mere\nnothing\u201d and \u201cno proposition by which any property is\nascribed to it can therefore be in itself and of itself a true one,\nnor therefore an instructive one\u201d. If there is any truth\nassociated with a fictitious entity it \u201ccan not belong to it in\nany other character than that of the intended and supposed equivalent\nof \u2026 some proposition having for its subject some real\nentity\u201d (1838\u201343, VIII, 246). The technique of\n\u201cparaphrasis\u201d was the key instrument Bentham employed to\ndemystify fictitious entities. Some fictitious entities are necessary\nfor human discourse, but their meaning can only be revealed through\ntheir connection to real entities (1977, 495n; 2010b, 287\u201388,\n317\u201318); if a fictitious entity proves impervious to this\nparaphrastic technique it is shown to be a meaningless abstraction\nunrelated to demonstrable reality. Concepts such as\n\u201cobligation\u201d and \u201c interests\u201d, for example,\ncan be rendered meaningful in terms of the perceptible pains and\npleasures experienced and anticipated by specific individuals.\nConcepts like \u201ccommunity\u201d derive their meaning from the\nsum of individuals that compose an actual community, and the happiness\nof a community is nothing but the aggregate happiness of the\nindividuals that constitute the community in question. On the other\nhand, theological propositions, having no correlation with material\nreality, deal not with the facts of ordinary experience but with a\nsupposed \u201creality\u201d that transcends the physical world, and\njust as the language of opinion ought to have no place in the\ndiscourse of physical science, so the untestable and unverifiable\npropositions of theology have no place in moral science.\n\nIn IPML, Bentham directed this analysis against a host of\nethical propositions he sought to eliminate as competing alternatives\nto the utility principle, such as \u201cmoral sense\u201d,\n\u201ccommon sense\u201d, \u201claw of reason\u201d,\n\u201cnatural justice\u201d, and \u201cnatural equity\u201d. All\nare dismissed on the grounds that they are merely empty phrases that\nexpress nothing beyond the sentiment of the person who advocates them.\nNot representing verifiable reality, such phrases could not be\nconsidered useful. Indeed, they were surely pernicious, serving as a\n\u201cpretense, and aliment, to despotism; if not \u2026 in\npractice, a despotism however in disposition\u201d (1970, 28n). By\ncomparison, \u201cutility\u201d was a principle rooted in the\nempirical and verifiable facts of the felt experience of pains and\npleasures.\n",
