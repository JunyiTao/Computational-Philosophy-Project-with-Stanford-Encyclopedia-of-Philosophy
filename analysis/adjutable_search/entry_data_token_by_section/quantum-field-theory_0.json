    "main_text": "What is QFT?\n1. What is QFT?\n In contrast to many other physical theories there is no canonical\ndefinition of what QFT is. Instead one can formulate a number of\ntotally different explications, all of which have their merits and\nlimits. One reason for this diversity is the fact that QFT has grown\nsuccessively in a very complex way. Another reason is that the\ninterpretation of QFT is particularly obscure, so that even the\nspectrum of options is not clear. Possibly the best and most\ncomprehensive understanding of QFT is gained by dwelling on its\nrelation to other physical theories, foremost with respect to QM, but\nalso with respect to classical electrodynamics, Special Relativity\nTheory (SRT) and Solid State Physics or more generally Statistical\nPhysics. However, the connection between QFT and these theories is\nalso complex and cannot be neatly described step by step.\n\nIf one thinks of QM as the modern theory of one particle (or, perhaps,\nvery few particles), one can then think of QFT as an extension of QM\nfor the analysis of systems with many particles\u2014and therefore with a large number of degrees of freedom. In this respect going from QM to\nQFT is not inevitable but rather beneficial for pragmatic\nreasons. However, a general threshold is crossed when it comes to\nfields, like the electromagnetic field, which are not merely difficult\nbut impossible to deal with in the frame of QM. Thus the transition\nfrom QM to QFT allows treatment of both particles and fields within a\nuniform theoretical framework. (As an aside, focusing on the number of\nparticles, or degrees of freedom respectively, explains why the famous\nrenormalization group methods can be applied in QFT as well as in\nStatistical Physics. The reason is simply that both disciplines study\nsystems with a large or an infinite number of degrees of freedom,\neither because one deals with fields, as does QFT, or because one\nstudies the thermodynamic limit, a very useful artifice in Statistical\nPhysics.) Moreover, issues regarding the number of particles under\nconsideration yield yet another reason why we need to extend\nQM. Neither QM nor its immediate relativistic extension with the\nKlein-Gordon and Dirac equations can describe systems with a\nvariable number of particles. However, obviously this is essential for\na theory that is supposed to describe scattering processes, where\nparticles of one kind are destroyed while others are created.\n\nOne gets a very different kind of access to what QFT is when focusing\non its relation to QM and SRT. Historically, QFT resulted from the\nsuccessful reconciliation of QM and SRT. In order to understand the\ninitial problem one has to realize that QM is not only in\na potential conflict with SRT, more exactly: the locality\npostulate of SRT, because of the famous EPR correlations of entangled\nquantum systems. There is also a manifest contradiction between QM and\nSRT on the level of the dynamics. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\ni.e., the fundamental law for the temporal evolution of the quantum\nmechanical state function, cannot possibly obey the relativistic\nrequirement that all physical laws of nature be invariant under\nLorentz transformations. The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations,\nresulting from the search for relativistic analogues of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation in the 1920s, do respect the requirement of\nLorentz invariance. Nevertheless, ultimately they are not satisfactory\nbecause they do not permit a description of fields in a principled\nquantum-mechanical way.\n\nFortunately, for various phenomena it is legitimate to neglect the\npostulates of SRT, namely when the relevant velocities are small in\nrelation to the speed of light and when the kinetic energies of the\nparticles are small compared to their mass energies\n\\(mc^2\\). And this is the reason why non-relativistic\nQM, although it cannot be the correct theory in the end, has its\nempirical successes. But it can never be the appropriate framework for\nelectromagnetic phenomena because electrodynamics, which prominently\nencompasses a description of the behavior of light, is already\nrelativistically invariant and therefore incompatible with\nnon-relativistic QM. Relativistic scattering experiments are another context in which QM\nfails. Since the involved particles often travel close to\nthe speed of light, relativistic effects can no longer be\nneglected. For that reason high-energy scattering experiments can only be\ncorrectly confronted by QFT.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the catchy characterization of QFT as the successful\nmerging of QM and SRT has its limits. On the one hand, as already\nmentioned above, there also is a relativistic QM, with the\nKlein-Gordon- and the Dirac-equation among their most famous\nresults. On the other hand, and this may come as a surprise, it is\npossible to formulate a non-relativistic version of QFT (see Bain\n2011). The nature of QFT thus cannot simply be that it reconciles QM\nwith the requirement of relativistic invariance. Consequently, for a\ndiscriminating criterion it is more appropriate to say that only QFT,\nand not QM, allows describing systems with an infinite number of\ndegrees of freedom, i.e., fields (and systems in the thermodynamic\nlimit). According to this line of reasoning, QM would be the modern\n(as opposed to classical) theory of particles and QFT the modern\ntheory of particles and fields. Unfortunately however, and\nthis shall be the last turn, even this gloss is not untarnished.\nThere is a widely discussed no-go theorem by Malament (1996) with the\nfollowing proposed interpretation: Even the quantum mechanics of one\nsingle particle can only be consonant with the locality principle of\nspecial relativity theory in the framework of a field theory, such as\nQFT. Hence ultimately, the characterization of QFT, on the one hand,\nas the quantum physical description of systems with an infinite number\nof degrees of freedom, and on the other hand, as the only way of\nreconciling QM with special relativity theory, are intimately\nconnected with one another.\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe diagram depicts the relations between different theories, where\nNon-Relativistic Quantum Field Theory is not a historical theory but\nrather an ex post construction that is illuminating for conceptual\npurposes. Theoretically, [(i), (ii), (iii)], [(ii), (i), (iii)] and\n[(ii), (iii), (i)] are three possible ways to get from Classical\nMechanics to Relativistic Quantum Field Theory. But note that this is\nmeant as a conceptual decomposition; history didn\u2019t go all these steps\nseparately. On the one hand, by good luck, so to say, Maxwell\u2019s equations of classical\nelectrodynamics were relativistically covariant from inception. The\nsuccessful quantization of that theory lead directly to the early Relativistic Quantum Field Theories. On the other hand, some would argue (e.g., Malament 1996) that\nthe only way to reconcile QM and SRT is in terms of a field theory, so\nthat (ii) and (iii) would coincide. Note that the steps (i), (ii) and\n(iii), i.e., quantization, transition to an infinite number of degrees\nof freedom, and reconciliation with SRT, are all ontologically\nrelevant. In other words, by these steps the nature of the physical\nentities the theories talk about may change fundamentally. See Huggett\n2003 for an alternative three-dimensional \u201cmap of\ntheories\u201d.\n\nFurther Reading on QFT and Philosophy of QFT. Mandl\nand Shaw (2010), Peskin and Schroeder (1995), Weinberg (1995) and\nWeinberg (1996) are standard textbooks on QFT. Teller (1995) and\nAuyang (1995) are the first systematic monographs on the philosophy of\nQFT. The anthologies Brown and Harr\u00e9 (1988), Cao (1999) and\nKuhlmann et al. (2002) are anthologies with contributions by\nphysicists and philosophers (of physics), the last of which\nfocuses on ontological issues. The literature on the philosophy of QFT\nhas increased significantly in the last decade. Besides several papers there are a few new monographs, Cao (2010), Kuhlmann (2010), Ruetsche (2011) and Duncan (2012) and a special issue (May 2011) of Studies in History\nand Philosophy of Modern Physics. Bain (2011), Huggett (2000), Ruetsche (2002) and Swanson (2017) provide article length discussions on a number of\nissues in the philosophy of QFT.\nSee also the following supplementary document: \n\nThe History of QFT.\n\n",
