    "main_text": "The Critique of Traditional Aesthetics\n1. The Critique of Traditional Aesthetics\n\n\nWittgenstein's opening remark is double-barreled: he states that\nthe field of aesthetics is both very big and entirely misunderstood. By\n\u201cvery big\u201d, I believe he means both that the aesthetic\ndimension weaves itself through all of philosophy in the manner\nsuggested above, and that the reach of the aesthetic in human\naffairs is very much greater than the far more restricted reach of the\nartistic; the world is densely packed with manifestations of\nthe aesthetic sense or aesthetic interest, while the number of works of\nart is very much smaller. There is good reason, in his discussions that\nfollow, to believe that he intends that any comprehensive account of\nthe aesthetic would acknowledge the former, and not just \u2013 as a\ngood number of philosophical accounts have so restricted themselves\n\u2013 the latter. By \u201centirely misunderstood\u201d, it\nemerges that he means both (1) that aesthetic questions are of a\nconceptual type very distinct from empirical questions and the\nkind of answer, or conceptual satisfaction, we want is very unlike what\nwe might get from an experiment in empirical psychology, and (2) that\nthe philosophically traditional method of essentialistic definition\n\u2013 determining the essence that all members of the class\n\u201cworks of art\u201d exhibit and by virtue of which they are so\nclassified \u2013 will conceal from our view more than it\nreveals.\u00a0\n",
