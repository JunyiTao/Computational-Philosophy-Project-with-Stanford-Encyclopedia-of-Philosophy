    "main_text": "Modernity || Modernity contra Modernization\n4.3 Modernity contra Modernization\n\nOnce things were different, Weber claimed. An unflinching sense of\nconviction that relied on nothing but one\u2019s innermost\npersonality once issued in a highly methodical and disciplined conduct\nof everyday life \u2013 or, simply, life as a duty. Born in the\ncrucible of the Reformation, this archetypal modern subjectivity drew\nits strength solely from within in the sense that one\u2019s\nprinciple of action was determined by one\u2019s own psychological\nneed to gain self-affirmation. Also, the way in which this deeply\nintrospective subjectivity was practiced, that is, in self-mastery,\nentailed a highly rational and radically methodical attitude towards\none\u2019s inner self and the outer, objective world. Transforming\nthe self into an integrated personality and mastering the world with\ntireless energy, subjective value and objective rationality once\nformed \u201cone unbroken whole\u201d [Weber 1910/1978, 319]. Weber\ncalls the agent of this unity the \u201cperson of vocation\u201d\n(Berufsmensch) in his religious writings,\n\u201cpersonality\u201d (Pers\u00f6nlichkeit) in the\nmethodological essays, \u201cgenuine politician\u201d\n(Berufspolitiker) in the political writings, and\n\u201ccharismatic individual\u201d in Economy and Society.\nThe much-celebrated Protestant Ethic thesis was indeed a genealogical\nreconsturction of this idiosyncratic moral agency in modern times\n[Goldman 1992].\n\nOnce different, too, was the mode of society constituted by and in\nturn constitutive of this type of moral agency. Weber\u2019s social\nimagination revealed its keenest sense of irony when he traced the\nroot of the cohesive integration, intense socialization, and severe\ncommunal discipline of sect-like associations to the isolated and\nintrospective subjectivity of the Puritan person of vocation. The\nirony was that the self-absorbed, anxiety-ridden and even antisocial\nvirtues of the person of vocation could be sustained only in the thick\ndisciplinary milieu of small-scale associational life. Membership in\nexclusive voluntary associational life is open, and it is such\nmembership, or \u201cachieved quality,\u201d that guarantees the\nethical qualities of the individuals with whom one interacts.\n\u201cThe old \u2018sect spirit\u2019 holds sway with relentless\neffect in the intrinsic nature of such associations,\u201d Weber\nobserved, for the sect was the first mass organization to combine\nindividual agency and social discipline in such a systematic way.\nWeber thus claimed that \u201cthe ascetic conventicles and sects\n\u2026 formed one of the most important foundations of modern\nindividualism\u201d [Weber 1920/1946, 321]. It seems clear that what\nWeber was trying to outline here is an archetypical form of social\norganization that can empower individual moral agency by sustaining\ngroup disciplinary dynamism, a kind of pluralistically organized\nsocial life we would now call a \u201ccivil society\u201d [Kim 2007,\n57\u201394].\n\nTo summarize, the irony with which Weber accounted for rationalization\nwas driven by the deepening tension between modernity and\nmodernization. Weber\u2019s problem with modernity\noriginates from the fact that it required a historically unique\nconstellation of cultural values and social institutions, and yet,\nmodernization has effectively undermined the cultural basis for modern\nindividualism and its germinating ground of disciplinary society,\nwhich together had given the original impetus to modernity. The modern\nproject has fallen victim to its own success, and in peril is the\nindividual moral agency and freedom. Under the late modern\ncircumstances characterized by the \u201ciron cage\u201d and\n\u201cwarring deities,\u201d then, Weber\u2019s question becomes:\n\u201cHow is it at all possible to salvage any remnants of\n\u2018individual\u2019 freedom of movement in any sense\ngiven this all-powerful trend\u201d [Weber 1918/1994, 159]?\n",
