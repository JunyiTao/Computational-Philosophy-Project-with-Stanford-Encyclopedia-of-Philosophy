Not concerning himself here\nwith the abstract concepts of space and time, Herbart instead looks to\nthe genesis of spatial perception (r\u00e4umliche\nAuffassungen) in earliest childhood. He notes that children\nirreversibly acquire, through practice, such\nperception:\n\n\nThe child\u2019s hand first learns to grasp, the eye first\nlearns to direct itself appropriately; but the adult\ninvoluntarily achieves what he learned; moreover, the pure sensible\nperception [of the child] is obscured by additions that his\ntraining [Ausbildung] mixes in. (SW VI:\n86)[54]\nSimilarly, although there are those who can do without\nsophisticated, acquired concepts of temporal magnitudes, roughly\nnoting the slower and the faster, yet once we learn rhythm and the\ndivision of time, we cannot return to the more primitive\nstate. Herbart thus disputes the notion that space and time are\noriginary facilities or faculties: the spatial and temporal are\nrather acquired, \u201ctrained, even artificial\nconceptions\u201d (SW VI: 86).\nHerbart now faces a problem. All spatial and temporal differences,\nsuch as right and left, or earlier and later, lie in the\nrepresentation, not in the act of representing (SW VI: 87). Yet\nbecause representing must precede the represented,\nthe soul must, through its representational activity\u2014which,\nitself, exhibits no spatio-temporal differences\u2014introduce\nspatio-temporal relations into the representation. Yet the\nrepresentation is not real; and, qu\u0101\nrepraesent\u0101tum, it cannot \u201creally\n[wirklich] be separated out in space or time\u201d:\n\u201cthe actual [wirkliche] psychological event of spatial\nrepresenting is something altogether non-spatial\u201d, just as\n\u201cthe representing of the temporal is something in which there\nis nothing of the thereby represented time\u201d (SW VI:\n89).[55]\nHerbart addresses the problem by appeal to the laws of reproduction\n(treated in the section on psycho-mechanics, above) (SW VI: 89). The\nrepresenting (activity) of the spatial must in some\nway resemble the spatial itself, or else its\nspatial repraesent\u0101tum would in no way be\n\u201cspatial\u201d.  And this resemblance lies in the\nmulti-dimensional nature of the interweaving of representational\nseries. As Stout simplifies Herbart\u2019s presentation,\n  interweaving means that from each term of a\ngiven series[,] trains of reproduction start, which are in their turn\nat once separated and interconnected by cross-series. On the side of\nthe presented content[,] regular mechanical interweaving is\ncorrelated with the consciousness of a spatial order\u2026. (Stout\n1888a: 338; SW VI: 89)\nIt is in this interconnection of \u201ccross-series\u201d that\nHerbart identifies the appearance of a lateral or\n\u201cneighboring\u201d ordering (eines Neben\neinander geordneten). The crucial element in this order\n(which applies not only to space but also to time and number\n(cf. Natorp 1910, and esp. SW VI: 110, ff. (\u00a7116)) is the\n\u201cgradation in the representations\u2019 connection\n[Abstufung in der Verbindung der Vorstellungen]\u201d laid\nout in psycho-mechanics (above) (SW VI: 90). Only now, as we apply\nthat abstract doctrine to experience, we see that the small number of\nrepresentations used for illustrative purposes \\((a, b, c, d,\n\\ldots)\\), together with their dimmed remainders \\((r, R, \\rho,\n\\mathfrak{r} \\ldots)\\), are far too few to account for the innumerable\nrepresentations generated by the minima visibilia\nand tangibilia of actual experience (SW VI: 90). Herbart\nwrites:\n\nWith every sense-contact of the spatial, every\nlittle colored or touchable place [Stelle] produces its own\nrepresentation; and every representation fuses with every other. (SW\nVI: 90)\n\n The picture he paints here is astonishing: as we\nsee and touch the world\u2014in particular, as one \u201cmoves the\nobserving eye and the touching finger forwards\nand backwards\u201d\u2014not only do we generate an\nunfathomable manifold of visible and tangible representations at any\ntime t, but each of these representations in turn produces a\ntrain of innumerable fading, graded fusions with all the others (SW\nVI: 90).  Thus innumerable series are generated and become interwoven\n(Weiss 1928: 92). The constantly generated perceptual representations\ngradually sink and shade away, fusing less and less with those\ntrailing after (SW VI: 90). But at the slightest return (i.e., due to\nthe finger or eye moving in reverse of its initial direction), all\nthe earlier percepts, now aided by the very similar new-comers, begin\nto rise, which rising is associated with\n\na nisus [upward pressure] to reproduce\nall those remaining [representation], whose [rising] velocity has\nexactly the same gradations as the earlier [graded] fusions. (SW VI:\n90)\nHow does this picture begin to explain the spatial character of\nvisual and tangible representations? The key is that any of\nthe earlier acquired percepts can, in rising, pull up over\nthe limen all the others, to wit, in their ordered\nplaces next to or between each other, and this all the while that\nthe act of representing remains \u201cpurely\nintensive\u201d (SW VI: 91). Thus the spatiality of our (visual)\nrepresentations is a function not of immediate sensation, but of an\ninterior process that lends perception \u201cspatial form\u201d,\nnamely those already present representations that reappear, governed\nby a law according to which each representation affects, in a regular\nway, the appearance of the others connected to it (SW VI: 91). Herbart\nwrites:\n\nInsofar as the instantaneous [new]\nsense-perception [Wahrnehmung] fuses with the already ordered\nrepresentation, it too becomes ordered; and in this way the persisting\nperception is incorporated in a continuous transition to spatial\nform. (SW VI: 91)\n\n Temporal representations are generated in a\nsimilar way, viz., in accordance with the laws governing the\nreproduction of the continuously woven tissue of representations (for\na more detailed account of the generation of temporal representation,\nsee Stout 1888b: 474, ff.).\n",
