In a well known passage, Donald\nDavidson summarizes his position as follows:\n\nWe have the idea of belief only from the role of belief in the\ninterpretation of language, for as a private attitude it is not\nintelligible except as an adjustment to the public norm provided by\nlanguage. It follows that a creature must be a member of a speech\ncommunity if it is to have the concept of belief. And given the\ndependence of other attitudes on belief, we can say more generally\nthat only a creature that can interpret speech can have the concept of\na thought.\n\n\nCan a creature have a belief if it does not have the concept of\nbelief? It seems to me it cannot, and for this reason. Someone cannot\nhave a belief unless he understands the possibility of being mistaken,\nand this requires grasping the contrast between truth and\nerror\u2014true belief and false belief. But this contrast, I have\nargued, can emerge only in the context of interpretation, which alone\nforces us to the idea of an objective, public truth. (Davidson 1975,\np. 170).\n\n\nThe argument links having beliefs and concepts with having the concept\nof belief. Since Davidson thinks that non-linguistic creatures\ncan\u2019t have the concept of belief, they can\u2019t have other\nconcepts as well. Why the concept of belief is needed to have other\nconcepts is somewhat obscure in Davidson\u2019s writings (Carruthers\n1992). And whether language is necessary for this particular concept\nis not obvious. In fact, there is an ongoing research program in\ncognitive science that addresses this very issue. A variety of\nnon-linguistic tasks have been given to animals and infants to\ndetermine the extent to which they are able to attribute mental states\nto others (see Andrews & Beck 2018 for work on animals and\nBaillargeon et al. 2015 for work on infants). These and related\nstudies provide strong evidence that at least some aspects of theory\nof mind are nonlinguistic.\n\nDavidson offers a pair of supplementary arguments that may elucidate\nwhy he is hesitant to turn the issue over to the cognitive scientists.\nHe gives the example of a man engaging in a non-linguistic task where\nthe man indicates his answer by making a choice, for example,\nselecting an apple over a pear. Davidson comments that until the man\nactually says what he has in mind, there will always be a question\nabout the conceptualization guiding his choice. \u201cRepeated tests\nmay make some readings of his actions more plausible than others, but\nthe problem will remain how to determine when he judges two objects of\nchoice to be identical\u201d (1975, p. 163). The second argument\npoints to the difficulties of settling upon a specification of what a\nnon-linguistic creature is thinking. \u201cThe dog, we say, knows\nthat its master is home. But does it know that Mr. Smith (who is the\nmaster) is home? We have no real idea how to settle, or make sense of,\nthese questions\u201d (1975, p, 163). It\u2019s not clear how\nseriously Davidson himself takes these arguments. Many philosophers\nhave been unconvinced. Notice that both arguments turn on an\nunderdetermination claim\u2014e.g., that the interpretation of the\nman\u2019s action is underdetermined by the non-linguistic evidence.\nBut much the same thing is true even if we add what the man says (or\nto be more precise, if we add what the man utters). The linguistic\nevidence doesn\u2019t guarantee a correct interpretation any more\nthan the non-linguistic evidence does.\n\nDavidson appears to be employing a very high standard for attributing\nconcepts to animals. In effect, he is asking for proof that our\nattributions are correct. In contrast, most philosophers who are happy\nto attribute concepts to animals do so because of a wealth of data\nthat are best explained by appealing to an internal system of\nrepresentation (e.g., Bermudez 2003, Carruthers 2006, Camp 2009; for\noverviews within cognitive science, see Gallistel 1990, Bekoff, Allen,\n& Burghardt 2002, and Shettleworth 2010). For example, many\nspecies of birds cache food for later retrieval. Their very survival\ndepends upon their ability to successfully recover, in some cases,\nmore than 10,000 different caches in a single season. Researchers\nstudying one species of caching birds have shown that not only do the\nbirds represent the location of the food, but they integrate this\ninformation with information about the quality of the food, its\nperishability, and whether their caching was observed by other birds.\nEvidence here comes from demonstrations of selective retrieval and\nrecaching of food items under experimentally controlled conditions.\nBirds will retrieve more perishable items first. When highly valued\nfood items become highly perishable, they shift strategies to retrieve\na higher percentage of less perishable food items. And birds that have\nthemselves stolen food from other birds will selectively recache\nstored food when they are observed caching it (see Clayton, Bussey,\n& Dickinson 2003, Emery, Dally, & Clayton 2004). Experimental\ndata of this kind provide evidence for particular concepts in birds\n(of food types, locations, and so on) as well as surprisingly\nsophisticated cognitive operations that make use of them.\n\nThere is a great deal of controversy among philosophers about the\nimplications of this type of research. Proponents of RTM are, of\ncourse, entirely happy with the idea that the scientific theories of\nwhat birds are doing can be taken at face value. Other philosophers\nmaintain that if the scientific theories say that birds are computing\nan algorithm for determining a caching strategy, then this can only be\nread as a fa\u00e7on de parler. Still others will grant that animals\nhave representations but go on to claim that these representation are\nof a lesser status, not to be confused with concepts (Brandom 1994,\n2000, McDowell 1994).\n\nThis raises an interesting question about whether there is a motivated\nand principled difference between concepts in humans and mere\nrepresentations in animals (Laurence & Margolis 2012).\nPhilosophers who maintain that there is such a difference often cite\nthe role of concepts in reasoning. For example, Robert Brandom claims\nthat representations in animals do little more than act as reliable\nmechanisms of discrimination. These representations are supposed to be\nlike thermometers, responding to specific environmental features yet\nwithout entering into appropriate inferential processes. However,\nit\u2019s not clear what counts as an appropriate inferential\nprocess, and certainly there is room for differing opinions on this\npoint. Moreover, whatever reasoning amounts to, comparative psychology\nis replete with examples that suggest that animals are capable of far\nmore than reliable detection. Animals may not be as smart as humans,\nbut that doesn\u2019t mean they are as dumb as thermometers (see\nHurley & Nudds 2006 and Carruthers 2006 on reasoning in\nanimals).\n",
