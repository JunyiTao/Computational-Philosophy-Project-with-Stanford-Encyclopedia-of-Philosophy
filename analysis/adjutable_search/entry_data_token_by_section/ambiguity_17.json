The Random House Dictionary, for\nexample, gives (amongst many others) the following two definitions for\n\u2018dog\u2019:\n\nany carnivore of the dog family Canidae, having prominent canine\nteeth and, in the wild state, a long and slender muzzle, a\ndeep-chested muscular body, a bushy tail, and large, erect ears.\nCompare canid.\nthe male of such an animal.\n\n\nIgnoring for now whether or not dictionaries manage to report\nanalyticities (is having a bushy tail really an analytic necessary\ncondition for being a dog?), it looks like sense (ii) and (iii) differ\nmerely by specification of gender, and so if this makes for ambiguity,\nit may well be hard to test for. Similarly for verbs that allow a\nfactive and non-factive reading such as \u2018report\u2019 where the\nfactive reading entails the non-factive. If I say \u2018the police\nreported that the criminal was apprehended but the police didn\u2019t\nreport that the criminal was apprehended\u2019 there is at least one\nreading that is anomalous, but largely out of contradiction engendered\nby entailment rather than univocality: it takes subtle intuitions to\ntrain one\u2019s ear to hear ambiguities when the meanings are\nlargely overlapping. As mentioned above, Pietroski and Hornstein\n(2002) make a similar point regarding syntactic ambiguities. Noting\nthat the two putative readings of \u2018every man loves a\nwoman\u2019 are such that the wide scope \u2018a woman\u2019\nreading entails the narrow, they ask whether or not we should be\ncountenancing a structural ambiguity or chalking up the two\n\u2018readings\u2019 to confusion over the specific and general\ncase. If these sorts of factors can interfere, we will indeed have to\napply our tests gingerly.\n4.6.2 The Inconsistency of Zeugma\n\nA problem for the conjunction reduction test involves the\ncontext-sensitivity of zeugma. As noted by Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk\n(following Cruse 1986), the following two are different in terms of\nzeugma:\n\n?Judy\u2019s dissertation is thought provoking and yellowed with\nage.\nJudy\u2019s dissertation is still thought provoking although\nyellowed with age.\n\n\nSimilarly, from the literature on generics:\n\nBees thrive in warm environments and hence are swarming my\nporch.\n\n\nThese cases looks like a problem for the conjunction reduction test,\ndepending on how one thinks we should treat the ambiguity in generics.\nOne might think that this provides evidence against ambiguity in bare\nplurals.\n",
