    "main_text": "Logical Nihilism\n3. Logical Nihilism\n\nThe pluralist\u2019s response to the generality objection has\ngenerated interest in a related view: logical nihilism\u2014the view\nthat there is no correct logic (Russell 2017, 2018a,b; Cotnoir 2018;\nsee also predecessors in Estrada-Gonz\u00e1les 2012 and Mortensen\n1989). Nihilism fits naturally into the spectrum that includes monism\n(exactly one correct logic) and pluralism (more than one correct\nlogic). As with monism and pluralism, what nihilism amounts to will\ndepend on what counts as a logic, and what it takes for one to be\ncorrect.\n\nOn the version most relevant here, the nihilist holds that the set of\ncorrect logical principles of the form \\(\\Gamma \\vDash A\\) is empty,\nso that there are no laws of logic (see Russell [2018a: 309\u201311]\nfor a nihilism-focused discussion of the form taken by laws of logic).\n\n\nIn the next subsection, we will look at one argument for logical\nnihilism, but before doing that, we should address the fact that many\npeople\u2019s initial reaction to nihilism is that there is no point\nin considering arguments for it, because the view is manifestly\nabsurd, or because it is somehow self-defeating.\n\nPeople sometimes think that nihilism is absurd because it appears to\nconflict with obvious truths about logic, things that students learn\nwhen they are first introduced to the subject. For example, it might\nbe suggested that the following simple argument is just obviously\ntruth-preserving and hence any view on which this is not the case is\nnot worth further consideration: \n\n\nIf snow is white, then grass is green. \n\nSnow is white. \n\nGrass is green. \n\n\nBut it\u2019s important to realise that the nihilist has no need to\nreject this simple instance of modus ponens. Their view is\nthat modus ponens is not a law of logic, which would require that\nevery instance of the argument form modus ponens is\ntruth-preserving. That\u2019s a much stronger and more general claim.\nLike other proponents of weaker logics, the nihilist can reject the\nvalidity of a putative law based on some quite rare and unusual cases,\nand then\u2014following the intuitionists and dialetheists discussed\nin the section on breaking metalogical harmony above\u2014engage in a\nproject of strength recapture that allows them to employ the\nprinciples of a stronger logic in circumstances where the esoteric\ncounterexamples don\u2019t threaten. The nihilist thinks that\narguments needn\u2019t be logically valid to be good\u2014in part\nbecause the requirement of logical validity is so strong.\n\nA second reason people sometimes think that nihilism deserves no\nfurther thought is that they regard it as self-defeating. After all,\npeople sometimes say, if the nihilist were right, there would be no\ngood arguments. Nihilism therefore undermines any argument for itself,\nand so there is no need to consider arguments for it.\n\nBut, as we have already seen, a nihilist needn\u2019t think that\nthere are no good arguments, only that there are no logically\nvalid arguments. This leaves open three kinds of argument that a\nnihilist can employ. First, an argument might be useful merely because\nit is valid according to their opponents; that at least permits an\nargument for nihilism that the opponents should accept by their own\nlights. Second, there can be good arguments which don\u2019t even\npretend to be logically valid; perhaps they employ inference to the\nbest explanation instead. Anti-exceptionalists, for example, often\nexpect the correct logic to be justified abductively, and so would not\nexpect the argument for the correct logic to be a logically valid one\n(Hjortland 2017). And third\u2014and most crucially for understanding\nthe nihilist\u2019s position\u2014the argument form employed might\nbe not be truth-preserving over all cases (and so not logically valid)\nbut still be truth-preserving in the case under consideration.\n\nWith these preliminaries out of the way, we examine one argument for\nlogical nihilism.\n",
