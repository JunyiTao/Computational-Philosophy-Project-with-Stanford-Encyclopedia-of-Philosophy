The Philosophical Physicists: Helmholtz and Planck\n\n\nAlthough Schlick was originally trained in Physics, it is important\nto remember that, in late 19th Century Germany, physicists\nwere deeply interested in philosophical issues, especially at\nBerlin. Schlick was the intellectual heir of both\n Hermann von Helmholtz,\na major figure among 19th Century physicists and a\nchampion of the zur\u00fcck zu Kant movement and Max\nPlanck. In 1889, Planck succeeded Gustav Kirchhoff and became\nHelmholtz\u2019 colleague. Both Helmholtz and Planck integrated\nKantian themes in their philosophical thinking and there can be no\ndoubt that, even though Schlick could never be considered much of a\nKantian, he was deeply sympathetic with many of Kant\u2019s\nideas. To begin with, Kant\u2019s interests in epistemological\nconcerns arising from the advanced mathematical sciences attracted\nSchlick\u2019s admiration and respect, much as it had drawn the\ninterests of Helmholtz and Planck. And all three embraced the\ngoal of developing a philosophical understanding of recent developments\nin physical science in the spirit, if not the letter, of Kant\u2019s\nthought. For the most part, their departures from Kant\u2019s\noriginal doctrines may be viewed as innovations or improvements of\nKant\u2019s insights, introduced without abandoning their own most\nfundamental philosophical commitments. \n\n\nFor instance, one of Helmholtz\u2019 most well-known innovations is\nthe study of perception in his monumental Handbook of Physiological\nOptics (1856\u20131867) (Helmholtz 1924\u20135). This work was the\nsource of his so-called \u2018sign-theory\u2019, based on the idea\nthat perceptions are signs or place-holders for what they signify, but\ndo not resemble or copy them in any way. In his early writings,\nHelmholtz thought sensations are signs of their external causes, so the\nassociations among sensations represent corresponding regularities\namong their sources. Consequently, it is the regular changes of\nsigns, their serial structure, which reflects the order of their\nunderlying causes. But this latter consequence implies a causal\ntheory of perception which is fundamentally antithetical to\nKant\u2019s understanding of causality. After all, Kant had\nrestricted the operations of causality to the realm of appearances,\nthus excluding unobservable causes lying behind and causing observable\nphenomena. But this departure from a basic tenet of Kant\u2019s\nthought was compounded by the fact that Helmholtz\u2019 account of the\nknowledge of the location of objects in space is thoroughly empiricist,\nand also rests on the principle of causality, understood as a causal\nrealist would. But in his 1881 notes to his memoir, Helmholtz\ncorrected himself, recalling that Kant\u2019s views on causality were\nlimited to lawfulness among appearances (Friedman 2010, 631; Friedman\n1997, 30\u20131). What Helmholtz then asserted, in his classic essay\n\u201cOn the Facts of Perception,\u201d is that the inference to a\nhypostasized reality lying behind the appearances goes beyond what is\nwarranted by the lawfulness obtaining among appearances. Indeed,\nall localizations of objects in space are really nothing more than the\ndiscovery of the lawfulness of the connections obtaining among our\nmotions and our perceptions. The difference between what is\ngenuinely perceived and its realistic interpretation is just the\ndifference between the regularities in our perceptions and the\nhypothesis of enduring, substantial sources of the perceived\nregularities (Helmholtz 1977, 138\u2013140). \n\n\nAlthough Helmholtz\u2019 philosophical work was not particularly\nwell-received by professional philosophers like\n Hermann Cohen,\nco-founder of the Marburg School of neo-Kantians, it exerted a powerful\ninfluence on physicists (Cohen 1885, 202\u2013204). In particular, Max\nPlanck was an early supporter of the sign-theory. But Planck\nnever interpreted the sign-theory causally, like Helmholtz had in his\nearliest writings. Rather, Planck recognized that \u201cour\nperceptions provide, not a representation of the external world\u201d\nbut, rather, \u201cmeasurements furnish the physicist with a sign\nwhich he must interpret\u201d (Planck 1960, 53; Planck 1933,\n84). Furthermore, Planck generalized the sign-theory, arguing that\nit is not objects, in and of themselves, which are known, but the\nstructural relations in which they stand to one another. His\nfundamental idea was that what is known are not the natures of\n\u2018things\u2019 but complex structures of relations connecting\n\u2018things\u2019 to one another (Planck 1933, 84ff. and 1960,\n53). Thus, the \u2018objects of knowledge\u2019 are not objects\nat all but, rather, what is known are the relata of the structural\nnetworks of relations in which they stand to other relata. And,\nas recent developments have increased the level of abstraction of\nscientific thought, it has become further removed from its\nanthropomorphic origins. So the unification of the scientific\nworld-picture is achieved through increasing abstraction which, in\nturn, drives structural representation, thus reducing the\nanthropomorphic elements in the scientific image of the\nworld (Planck 1949, 105).  The result of\nPlanck\u2019s effort is a theory of knowledge which is structuralist,\ngeneralized from Helmholtz\u2019 sign-theory of perception, but which\nnonetheless preserves the themes of unification and objectivity derived\nfrom Kant.\n\n\nThese themes are particularly evident in Planck\u2019s celebrated\n(1908) Leiden lecture on \u201cThe Unity of the Physical\nUniverse\u201d, directed at Ernst Mach\u2019s phenomenalistic\nNaturphilosophie (Planck 1960, 1\u201326). Without going into\ndetails, Mach regarded physical objects as unnecessary\nhypostasizations, implying that the mechanical view underlying physics\nis little more than an elaborate myth. The physics of the matter\nwere effectively settled when Planck secured the mechanical foundations\nof irreversibility in his Radiation Law of 1900 by relying on Ludwig\nBoltzmann\u2019s statistical approach to thermodynamics which, in\nturn, implied atomism. Yet it remained to establish the\nphilosophical implications of these achievements. In his Leiden\nlecture, Planck argued that this result presented an objective\nworld-picture abstracted from its anthropomorphic origins to produce a\nsynthetically unified image of the world (Planck 1960, 6). Such a view, Planck argued, can\nonly be produced through the unification of the diverse fields of\nphysical phenomena if they are synthesized by means of mathematical\nabstraction. Such abstraction generalizes the sign-theory to\napply to theoretical as well as perceptual representations, resulting\nin a full-blown structuralist epistemology (Planck 1933, 84ff.; Planck\n1949, 105). And it is this method of abstraction that\nproduces the synthetic unity grounding scientific objectivity. \nThe result is that physical entities are \u2018objective\u2019, in\nthe Kantian sense, since they embody the lawfulness of\nappearances. Indeed, Planck insisted that what is\n\u2018objective\u2019 is precisely what the heroes of the history of\nscience, from Copernicus to Faraday, would have regarded as\n\u2018real\u2019 (Planck 1970, 25\u20136).  Despite the\nstrident Kantian themes of Planck\u2019s argument, his conclusion has\nalways been regarded as a particularly virulent form of convergent\nrealism (St\u00f6lzner 2010).\n",
