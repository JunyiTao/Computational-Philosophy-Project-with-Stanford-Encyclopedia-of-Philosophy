Stuff as a Special Kind of Thing or Things\n\nA natural thought to have about sentences with referring nominal\nconcrete mass expressions (e.g., \u201cAlvin drank the water\nthat Roderick poured\u201d or \u201cThe coffee in that cup\nis too hot\u201d) is that the expressions refer to portions of\nmatter, which are themselves made up of smaller bits of matter. It\nseems obvious that thinking this is what taking such\nsentences at face value amounts to. Not obvious, though, is what\nmetaphysical commitments this requires, and what metaphysical problems\nmight come along with this thought.\n\nA general consensus has been reached that it is helpful to think\nthrough these issues about matter within the framework of\nmereology, or the logic of parts and wholes, even though there is much\ndisagreement about what the correct mereology is.\n",
