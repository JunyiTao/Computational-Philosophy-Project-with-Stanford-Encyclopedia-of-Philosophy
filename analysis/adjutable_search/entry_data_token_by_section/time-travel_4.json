    "main_text": "The Grandfather Paradox || Can and Cannot\n2.1 Can and Cannot\nA problem remains. Suppose Tim, a time-traveller, is facing his\ngrandfather with a loaded gun. Can Tim kill Grandfather? On the one\nhand, yes he can. He is an excellent shot; there is no chaperone to\nstop him; the laws of logic will not magically stay his hand; he hates\nGrandfather and will not hesitate to pull the trigger; etc. On the\nother hand, no he can\u2019t. To kill Grandfather would be to change\nthe past, and no-one can do that (not to mention the fact that if\nGrandfather died, then Tim would not have been born). So we have a\ncontradiction: Tim can kill Grandfather and Tim cannot kill\nGrandfather. Time travel thus leads to a contradiction: so it is\nimpossible.\n\n\nNote the difference between this version of the Grandfather paradox\nand the version considered above. In the earlier version, the\ncontradiction happens if Tim kills Grandfather. The solution was to\nsay that Tim can go into the past without killing\nGrandfather\u2014hence time travel does not entail a\ncontradiction. In the new version, the contradiction happens as soon\nas Tim gets to the past. Of course Tim does not kill\nGrandfather\u2014but we still have a contradiction anyway: for he\nboth can do it, and cannot do it. As Lewis puts it:\n Could a time traveler change the past? It seems not:\nthe events of a past moment could no more change than numbers\ncould. Yet it seems that he would be as able as anyone to do things\nthat would change the past if he did them. If a time traveler visiting\nthe past both could and couldn\u2019t do something that would change\nit, then there cannot possibly be such a time traveler. (Lewis, 1976,\n149)\n\n\n\nLewis\u2019s own solution to this problem has been widely\naccepted.[16] It\nturns on the idea that to say that something can happen is to\nsay that its occurrence is compossible with certain facts, where\ncontext determines (more or less) which facts are the relevant\nones. Tim\u2019s killing Grandfather in 1921 is compossible with the\nfacts about his weapon, training, state of mind, and so on. It is not\ncompossible with further facts, such as the fact that Grandfather did\nnot die in 1921. Thus \u2018Tim can kill Grandfather\u2019 is true\nin one sense (relative to one set of facts) and false in another sense\n(relative to another set of facts)\u2014but there is no single sense\nin which it is both true and false. So there is no contradiction\nhere\u2014merely an equivocation.\n\n\nAnother response is that of Vihvelin (1996), who argues that there is\nno contradiction here because \u2018Tim can kill Grandfather\u2019\nis simply false (i.e. contra Lewis, there is no legitimate sense in\nwhich it is true). According to Vihvelin, for \u2018Tim can kill\nGrandfather\u2019 to be true, there must be at least some occasions\non which \u2018If Tim had tried to kill Grandfather, he would or at\nleast might have succeeded\u2019 is true\u2014but, Vihvelin argues,\nat any world remotely like ours, the latter counterfactual is always\nfalse.[17]\n",
