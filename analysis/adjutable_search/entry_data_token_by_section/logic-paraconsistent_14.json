    "main_text": "Systems of Paraconsistent Logic || Adaptive Logics\n3.4 Adaptive Logics\n\nOne may think not only that an inconsistency needs to be isolated but\nalso that a serious need for the consideration of inconsistencies is a\nrare occurrence. The thought may be that consistency is the norm until\nproven otherwise: we should treat a sentence or a theory as\nconsistently as possible. This is essentially the motivation for\nadaptive logics, pioneered by Diderik Batens in Belgium.\n\nAn adaptive logic is a logic that adapts itself to the situation at\nthe time of application of inference rules. It models the dynamics of\nour reasoning. There are two senses in which reasoning is dynamic:\nexternal and internal. Reasoning is externally dynamic if as\nnew information becomes available expanding the premise set,\nconsequences inferred previously may have to be withdrawn. The\nexternal dynamics is thus the non-monotonic character of some\nconsequence relations: \\(\\Gamma \\vdash A\\) and \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta\n\\not\\vdash A\\) for some \\(\\Gamma , \\Delta\\) and \\(A\\). However, even\nif the premise-set remains constant, some previously inferred\nconclusion may be considered as not derivable at a later stage. As our\nreasoning proceeds from a premise set, we may encounter a situation\nwhere we infer a consequence provided that no abnormality, in\nparticular no contradiction, obtains at some stage of the reasoning\nprocess. If we are forced to infer a contradiction at a later stage,\nour reasoning has to adapt itself so that an application of the\npreviously used inference rule is withdrawn. In such a case, reasoning\nis internally dynamic. Our reasoning may be internally\ndynamic if the set of valid inferences is not recursively enumerable\n(i.e., there is no decision procedure that leads to \u2018yes\u2019\nafter finitely many steps if the inference is indeed valid). It is the\ninternal dynamics that adaptive logics are devised to capture.\n\nIn order to illustrate the idea behind adaptive logics, consider the\npremise set \\(\\Gamma = \\{p, \\neg p \\vee r, \\neg r \\vee s, \\neg s, s\n\\vee t\\}\\). One may start reasoning with \\(\\neg s\\) and \\(s \\vee t\\),\nusing the Disjunctive Syllogism (DS) to infer \\(t\\), given that \\(s\n\\wedge \\neg s\\) does not obtain. We then reason with \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg\np \\vee r\\), to infer \\(r\\) with the DS, given that \\(p \\wedge \\neg p\\)\ndoes not obtain. Now, we can apply the DS to \\(\\neg r \\vee s\\) and\n\\(r\\) to derive \\(s\\), provided that \\(r \\wedge \\neg r\\) does not\nobtain. However, by conjoining \\(s\\) and \\(\\neg s\\), we can obtain \\(s\n\\wedge \\neg s\\). Hence we must withdraw the first application of DS,\nand so the proof of \\(t\\) lapses. A consequence of this reasoning is\nwhat cannot be defeated at any stage of the process.\n\nA system of adaptive logic can generally be characterised as\nconsisting of three elements:\n\nA lower limit logic (LLL)\nA set of abnormalities\nAn adaptive strategy\n\n\nLLL is the part of an adaptive logic that is not subject to\nadaptation. It consists essentially of a number of inferential rules\n(and/or axioms) that one is happy to accept regardless of the\nsituation in a reasoning process. A set of abnormalities is a set of\nformulas that are presupposed as not holding (or as absurd) at the\nbeginning of reasoning until they are shown to be otherwise. For many\nadaptive logics, a formula in this set is of the form \\(A \\wedge \\neg\nA\\). An adaptive strategy specifies a strategy of handling the\napplications of inference rules based on the set of abnormalities. If\nLLL is extended with the requirement that no abnormality is logically\npossible, one obtains the upper limit logic (ULL). ULL essentially\ncontains not only the inferential rules (and/or axioms) of LLL but\nalso supplementary rules (and/or axioms) that can be applied in the\nabsence of abnormality, such as DS. By specifying these three\nelements, one obtains a system of adaptive logic.\n",
