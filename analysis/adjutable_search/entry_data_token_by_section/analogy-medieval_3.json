    "main_text": "Divisions of Equivocation\n4. Divisions of Equivocation\n\nIn order to understand the way in which theories of analogy developed,\nwe need to consider the divisions of equivocation found in medieval\nauthors. In his commentary on the Categories, Boethius\npresented a series of divisions which he took from Greek authors. The\nfirst division was into chance equivocals and deliberate equivocals.\nIn the first case, the occurrences of the equivocal term were totally\nunconnected, as when a barking animal, a marine animal, and a\nconstellation were all called \u2018canis\u2019 (dog).\nChance equivocation was also called pure equivocation, and it was\ncarefully distinguished from analogy by later writers. In the second\ncase, that of deliberate equivocation, some intention on the part of\nthe speakers was involved, and the occurrences of the equivocal term\ncould be related in various ways. Boethius himself gave four\nsubdivisions. These are found in various later sources, including\nOckham\u2019s commentary on the Categories, but as we shall\nsee, other subdivisions became more popular.\n\nThe first of Boethius\u2019s four subdivisions was similitude, used\nof the case of the noun \u2018animal\u2019 said of both real human\nbeings and pictured human beings. Medieval logicians seem to have been\ntotally unaware of the fact that the Greek word used by Aristotle was\ngenuinely polysemous, meaning both animal and image, and they\nexplained the extended use of \u2018animal\u2019 in terms of a\nlikeness between the two referents \u2014 a likeness which had\nnothing to do with the significate of the term \u2018animal\u2019,\nwhich picks out a certain kind of nature, but which was nonetheless\nmore than metaphorical in that the external shape of the pictured\nobject does correspond to that of the living object. Those medieval\nauthors whose discussion of equivocation was very brief tended to use\nthis example, and they often claimed that Aristotle introduced it in\norder to accommodate analogy as a kind of equivocation. On the other\nhand, authors whose discussion was more extensive tended to drop both\nthe example and the subdivision of similitude.\n\nBoethius\u2019s second type of equivocation is\n\u2018analogia\u2019 in the Greek sense, and the standard\nexample was the word \u2018principium\u2019 (principle or\norigin), which was said to apply to unity with respect to number and\nto point with respect to a line, or to both the source of a river and\nthe heart of an animal. \u2018Principium\u2019 is a noun\nand, as such, might be expected to pick out a common nature, but\nalthough a unity, a point, a source and a heart can all be called\n\u2018principium\u2019 with equal propriety, there is no\ncommon nature involved. Mathematical objects, rivers, and hearts,\nrepresent not merely different natural kinds, but different\ncategories, in that mathematical objects fall under the category of\nquantity, and hearts at least under the category of substance. What\nallows these disparate things to be grouped together is a similarity\nof relations: a source is to a river as a heart is to an animal\n\u2014 or so it was claimed. While theologians, including Aquinas\nhimself in De veritate, and the fourteenth-century Dominican\nThomas Sutton, occasionally make use of this type of analogy, most\nlogicians do not even mention it.\n\nThe last two subdivisions found in Boethius are \u2018of one\norigin\u2019 (ab uno), with the example of the word\n\u2018medical\u2019, and \u2018in relation to one\u2019 (ad\nunum), with the example of the word \u2018healthy\u2019. These\nsubdivisions correspond to Aristotle\u2019s pros hen\nequivocation. The example \u2018healthy\u2019 (sanum) as\nsaid of animals, their diet, and their urine is particularly important\nhere. \u2018Sanum\u2019, like other adjectives, was classified as a\nconcrete accidental term. As such, it did not fall within an\nAristotelian category, since its primary signification had two\nelements whose combination was variously explained. On the one hand,\nsome kind of reference is made to the abstract entity health, which\nbelongs to the category of quality; on the other hand, some kind of\nreference is made to an external object which belongs to the category\nof substance. This dual reference precludes the term from picking out\na natural kind, though in the case of other adjectives, such as\n\u2018brown\u2019, no problem is caused thereby. Brown things may\nnot form a natural kind, but at least they are all physical objects,\nand \u2018brown\u2019 is used in the same sense of each one.\n\u2018Healthy\u2019, however, is more complicated. To say that Rover\nis healthy is to say that Rover is a thing having health, and\nobviously this analysis can\u2019t be applied to diet, which is\ncalled healthy only because it causes health in an animal, or to\nurine, which is called healthy only when it is the sign of health in\nan animal. Whatever the properties which characterize urine and food,\nthey are different from those characterizing the animal.\n\nWe should also note that in the same passage of his commentary on the\nCategories, Boethius linked deliberate equivocation with\nmetaphor, in which the sense of one word with an established\nsignification was extended to apply improperly to something else. A\nfavourite medieval example was \u2018smiling\u2019 said of flowering\nmeadows. Later logicians supported this link between equivocation and\nmetaphor by an appeal to Aristotle\u2019s divisions of equivocation\nin his Sophistical Refutations, where he remarked that the\nsecond type was based on common usage. As we shall see, the question\nof metaphor\u2019s relation to analogy became particularly important\nin post-thirteenth-century discussions.\n",
