    "main_text": "The Transcendental Deduction || Representations of Objects and the Single-Substantive-Premise Interpretation of the B-Deduction\n1.2 Representations of Objects and the Single-Substantive-Premise Interpretation of the B-Deduction\n\nAccording to one widespread reading of the B-Deduction,\n\u00a7\u00a715\u201320 comprise a an argument whose only assumption\nis the premise about self-consciousness that Kant defends in \u00a716.\nStrawson, for example, is a proponent of such an interpretation\n(1966), as are Robert Paul Wolff (1963), Jonathan Bennett (1966),\nHenry Allison (1983), Edwin McCann (1985), and Dennis Schulting\n(2012a). Demonstrating that we represent objects or an objective world\nhas a key role in most versions of this reading. On Strawson\u2019s\ninterpretation, for instance, \u201cthe fact that my experience is of\na unified objective world is a necessary consequence of the fact that\nonly under this condition could I be conscious of my diverse\nexperiences as one and all my own\u201d (1966: 94). Some interpreters\ndissent; Karl Ameriks, for example, contends that Strawson\u2019s\nconception of the Deduction is motivated by a desire to see it as\nshowing that the skeptic about the external world is mistaken, while\nin fact refuting this sort of skeptic is not one of Kant\u2019s aims\nfor this argument (Ameriks 1978; also Allais 2011, 2015). Patricia\nKitcher (2011: 115\u201318) argues against the single premise about\nself-consciousness interpretation on historical and textual\ngrounds.\n\nAn uncontroversial role of \u00a717 is to provide a characterization\nof an object, or more to the point, of a representation of an object,\nthat facilitates a challenge to Humean associationism. Kant\u2019s\nproposal is that an object is \u201cthat in the concept of which a\nmanifold of a given intuition is united\u201d (B137). Here\n\u2018object\u2019 should be read in the broad sense of\nobjective feature of reality \u2013 a feature whose\nexistence and nature is independent of how it is perceived (B 142;\nBird 1962/1973 130\u201331; Strawson 1966: 98\u2013104; Guyer 1987:\n11\u201324). Allison is a proponent of the view that \u00a717 contain\nnot only this challenge to Hume, but also an attempt to demonstrate\nthat we represent objects on the basis of the conclusions about\nself-consciousness established in \u00a716. This interpretation is a\ncomponent of Allison\u2019s broader vision of the B-Deduction,\naccording to which Kant demonstrates that the unity of apperception\nentails that we represent objects, and, conversely, that our\nrepresenting objects entails the necessary unity of apperception\n(Allison 1983: 144ff; 2015: 352\u201355; 2015: 335\u201355, esp. 352)\nIndeed, the crucial claim for Allison\u2019s interpretation is that\nthe unity of apperception is not only a necessary but also sufficient\ncondition for our representing of objects. This he calls the\nreciprocity thesis. Other commentators, including Richard\nAquila (1989: 159), Howell (1992: 227\u20138) and Schulting (2012a)\nagree that the B-Deduction features the reciprocity thesis and an\nattempt to establish its truth, while Ameriks (1978) disagrees. On an\naccount of the sort Ameriks favors, the unity of apperception, and\nmore exactly, the synthesis that explains our consciousness of the\nidentity of the subject, is only a necessary condition for the\nrepresentation of objects (cf. Allais 2011).\n\nAllison\u2019s interpretation is attractive particularly because it\npromises leverage against the skeptic who denies that we represent\nobjects, and also because this leverage is generated by premises about\nself-consciousness that this skeptic is likely to accept.\nNevertheless, there are textual and charitable reasons to resist this\nreading (Ameriks 1978, Pereboom 1995; Patricia Kitcher 2011:\n115\u201360; Vinci 2014: 193\u201394). First of all, in\n\u00a7\u00a718\u201320 Kant makes significant assumptions about\nfeatures of our representations of objects that exceed anything that\nhe has argued for in \u00a717 or earlier. In particular, \u00a718 he\nassumes that our representations of objects manifest a certain kind of\nnecessity and universality, and this he does not purport to establish\nin \u00a717 or earlier. Moreover, in the summary of the preceding\nsteps of the B-Deduction in \u00a720 Kant does not include premises\nfrom \u00a7\u00a715\u201316. What we actually encounter in \u00a720\nindicates that Kant intends \u00a7\u00a717\u201320, with some help\nfrom \u00a713, to constitute a single, self-contained argument that\ndoes not depend on the conclusions about self-consciousness developed\nin \u00a7\u00a715\u201316.\n\nOn Allison\u2019s conception, the argument from the unity of\napperception (or, equivalently, from the unity of consciousness) for\nour representing objects occurs in the following passage:\n\n(A) Understanding is, to use general terms, the faculty of cognitions\n(Erkenntnisse). They consist (bestehen) in the\ndeterminate relation of given representations to an object: and an\nobject is that in the concept of which the manifold of a given\nintuition is united. Now all unification of representations demands\nunity of consciousness in the synthesis of them. Consequently it is\nthe unity of consciousness that alone constitutes the relation of\nrepresentations to an object, and therefore their objective validity\nand the fact that they are cognitions (Erkenntnisse): and\nupon it therefore rests the very possibility of the understanding.\n(B137)\n\n\nAllison himself presents a problem for his interpretation of this\npassage. He contends, first of all, that the reciprocity thesis is\nencapsulated in this sentence:\n\nIt is the unity of consciousness that alone constitutes\n[ausmacht] the relation of representations to an object, and\ntherefore their objective validity.\n\n\nand that Kant presents (1) as a direct consequence of the premise\nthat\n\nall unification of representations demands unity of consciousness\nin the synthesis of them.\n\n\nAllison points out that on this reading Kant\u2019s reasoning appears\nto involve a non sequitur, since (2) supports only\nKant\u2019s having in mind that the unity of consciousness is a\nnecessary condition for the representation of an object, and not for\nits also being a sufficient condition. Howell raises a similar\nconcern: \u201cIn \u00a717 Kant simply does not make this inference\nclear, and an air of blatant fallacy hovers over this part of his\nreasoning\u201d (Howell 1992: 228; for an opposing view see Keller\n1998: 80). But Ameriks argues that the B-Deduction should not be\ninterpreted as providing an argument for the sufficiency claim, and a\nrespectable case can be made for his reading (Ameriks 1978; Pereboom\n1995; Patricia Kitcher 2011: 115\u201360).\n\nAllison and Howell both argue that (1) should be read as a statement\nof the sufficiency claim. Now in (A) Kant contends that cognitions of\nobjects consist in a determinate relation of representations to\nobjects, and as (1) indicates, this relation is constituted or\nproduced by a synthesis that essentially involves the unity of\nconsciousness. However, (1) does not indicate that the synthesis that\ninvolves unity of consciousness cannot occur without its resulting in\na relation of a representation to an object. By analogy, the smelting\nand molding of steel are processes that constitute or produce steel\ngirders, but from this one should not conclude that the processes of\nsmelting and molding steel cannot take place without the production of\nsteel girders. Just as producing steel girders also requires molds of\nparticular shapes, so producing representations of objects might\nrequire, in addition to the synthesis that involves the unity of\nconsciousness, particular concepts of objects.\n\nIf the sufficiency claim, and with it the reciprocity thesis, is\ndenied, we need an alternative account of how \u00a717 functions in\nthe overall argument of the B-Deduction. It may be that the role of\nthis section is largely to provide a characterization of an object\nthat has a key role in the ensuing challenge to Humean associationism,\nand thereby initiates an argument from below. Kant\u2019s proposal is\nthat an object is \u201cthat in the concept of which a manifold of a\ngiven intuition is united\u201d (B137). The subsequent claim is that\nthe unification of a manifold requires synthesis; immediately\nfollowing the characterization of an object he states that \u201call\nunification of representations demands unity of consciousness in the\nsynthesis of them\u201d (B137). It seems consistent with these texts\nthat Kant\u2019s characterization of an object is designed just to\npresent his anti-Humean theory of the mental processing required for\nrepresenting objects, and that the subsequent claim for the need for\nsynthesis does not express a view he expects us to accept without\nfurther argument, but rather one he aims to confirm in\n\u00a7\u00a718\u201320. If this argument succeeds, it will turn out\nthat the a priori synthesis required to account for the\nfeatures of our representations of objects Kant singles out is the\nsame process that yields my consciousness of the identity of myself as\nsubject of different self-attributions.\n",
