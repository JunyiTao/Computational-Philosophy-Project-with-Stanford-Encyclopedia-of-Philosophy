    "main_text": "Perception, Concepts and Sense-Object Relations || Types of Sense-Object Relation\n7.2 Types of Sense-Object Relation\n\nThe Manual of Reason (TS 48) reports the standard Ny\u0101ya\nview, which is due to Uddyotakara, that there are exactly six types of\nsense-object relation which ground perceptual experiences:\n\nContact or conjunction (sa\u1e43yoga). Ordinary\nperceptions, e.g. of a pot. If by \u2018contact\u2019 we understand\nsome sort of causal relation, then the Ny\u0101ya can be said to have\na causal theory of perception. However, they may mean that the eye is\nin contact with the object in some more literal sense.\nInherence-in-the-conjoined\n(sa\u1e43yukta-samav\u0101ya). We noted above that, in\n\u2018non-qualificative\u2019 perception, one sees the object and\nits feature together. The relation between the feature and the\nperceiver is an indirect one\u2014the feature inheres in the object,\nwith which the perceiver is in contact.\nInherence-in-the-inherent-in-the-conjoined\n(sa\u1e43yukta-samaveta-samav\u0101ya). If the feature in\n(2) is a quality (gu\u1e47a), e.g. a particular shade of\nblue, then inhering in it is a universal, blueness, which can itself\napparently be perceived.\nInherence (samav\u0101ya). The\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas have a rather strange doctrine, that\neach sense-faculty is made out of the type of substance with which it\nis particularly associated. The auditory faculty is thus made out of\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba, and, as sounds inhere in\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba, the relation between the hearer and the\nsound is inherence.\nInherence-in-the-inherent (samaveta-samav\u0101ya). By\nthis indirect relation, the hearer is related to properties such as\nsound-hood inhering in sound.\nQualifier-qualificand relation\n(vi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e47a-vi\u015be\u1e63ya-bh\u0101va).\nThis is an important one. The Ny\u0101ya believe that absences are\n\u2018real\u2019 objects, e.g. the absence of an elephant in the\nroom now, and that they can be perceived. Absences are said to qualify\ntheir substrata, and are perceived indirectly, by the perceiver seeing\nthe substratum. The Buddhist Dharmak\u012brti argued that this is\nreally an inference from non-apprehension (anupalabdhi-hetu)\nrunning thus: \u201cI perceive the walls of the room; if there were an\nelephant, I would not see it, and my perceptual faculties are working\nnormally; therefore, there is no elephant\u201d.\n\n",
