    "main_text": "General Philosophical Questions about Moral Reasoning || Moral Learning and the Revision of Moral Views\n2.7 How Can We Reason, Morally, With One Another?\n\nSo far, we have mainly been discussing moral reasoning as if it were a\nsolitary endeavor. This is, at best, a convenient simplification. At\nworst, it is, as J\u00fcrgen Habermas has long argued, deeply\ndistorting of reasoning\u2019s essentially dialogical or\nconversational character (e.g., Habermas 1984; cf. Laden 2012). In any\ncase, it is clear that we often do need to reason morally with one\nanother. \n\nHere, we are interested in how people may actually reason with one\nanother \u2013 not in how imagined participants in an original\nposition or ideal speech situation may be said to reason with one\nanother, which is a concern for moral theory, proper. There are two\nsalient and distinct ways of thinking about people morally reasoning\nwith one another: as members of an organized or corporate body that is\ncapable of reaching practical decisions of its own; and as autonomous\nindividuals working outside any such structure to figure out with each\nother what they ought, morally, to do. \n\nThe nature and possibility of collective reasoning within an organized\ncollective body has recently been the subject of some discussion.\nCollectives can reason if they are structured as an agent. This\nstructure might or might not be institutionalized. In line with the\ngloss of reasoning offered above, which presupposes being guided by an\nassessment of one\u2019s reasons, it is plausible to hold that a\ngroup agent \u201ccounts as reasoning, not just rational, only if it\nis able to form not only beliefs in propositions \u2013 that\nis, object-language beliefs \u2013 but also belief about\npropositions\u201d (List and Pettit 2011, 63). As List and Pettit\nhave shown (2011, 109\u2013113), participants in a collective agent\nwill unavoidably have incentives to misrepresent their own preferences\nin conditions involving ideologically structured disagreements where\nthe contending parties are oriented to achieving or avoiding certain\noutcomes \u2013 as is sometimes the case where serious moral\ndisagreements arise. In contexts where what ultimately matters is how\nwell the relevant group or collective ends up faring, \u201cteam\nreasoning\u201d that takes advantage of orientation towards the\ncollective flourishing of the group can help it reach a collectively\noptimal outcome (Sugden 1993, Bacharach 2006; see entry on\n collective intentionality).\n Where the group in question is smaller than the set of persons,\nhowever, such a collectively prudential focus is distinct from a moral\nfocus and seems at odds with the kind of impartiality typically\nthought distinctive of the moral point of view. Thinking about what a\n\u201cteam-orientation\u201d to the set all persons might look like might bring\nus back to thoughts of Kantian universalizability; but recall that\nhere we are focused on actual reasoning, not hypothetical reasoning.\nWith regard to actual reasoning, even if individuals can take up such\nan orientation towards the \u201cteam\u201d of all persons, there is serious\nreason, highlighted by another strand of the Kantian tradition, for\ndoubting that any individual can aptly surrender their moral judgment\nto any group\u2019s verdict (Wolff 1998). \n\nThis does not mean that people cannot reason together, morally. It\nsuggests, however, that such joint reasoning is best pursued as a\nmatter of working out together, as independent moral agents, what they\nought to do with regard to an issue on which they have some need to\ncooperate. Even if deferring to another agent\u2019s verdict as to\nhow one morally ought to act is off the cards, it is still possible\nthat one may licitly take account of the moral testimony of others\n(for differing views, see McGrath 2009, Enoch 2014).\n\nIn the case of independent individuals reasoning morally with one\nanother, we may expect that moral disagreement provides the occasion\nrather than an obstacle. To be sure, if individuals\u2019 moral\ndisagreement is very deep, they may not be able to get this reasoning\noff the ground; but as Kant\u2019s example of Charles V and his\nbrother each wanting Milan reminds us, intractable disagreement can\narise also from disagreements that, while conceptually shallow, are\ncircumstantially sharp. If it were true that clear-headed\njustification of one\u2019s moral beliefs required seeing them as\nbeing ultimately grounded in a priori principles, as G.A. Cohen argued\n(Cohen 2008, chap. 6), then room for individuals to work out their\nmoral disagreements by reasoning with one another would seem to be\nrelatively restricted; but whether the nature of (clearheaded) moral\ngrounding is really so restricted is seriously doubtful (Richardson\n2018, \u00a79.2). In contrast to what such a picture suggests,\nindividuals\u2019 moral commitments seem sufficiently open to being\nre-thought that people seem able to engage in principled \u2013 that\nis, not simply loss-minimizing \u2013 compromise (Richardson 2018,\n\u00a78.5). \n\nWhat about the possibility that the moral community as a whole \u2013\nroughly, the community of all persons \u2013 can reason? This\npossibility does not raise the kind of threat to impartiality that is\nraised by the team reasoning of a smaller group of people; but it is\nhard to see it working in a way that does not run afoul of the concern\nabout whether any person can aptly defer, in a strong sense, to the\nmoral judgments of another agent. Even so, a residual possibility\nremains, which is that the moral community can reason in just one way,\nnamely by accepting or ratifying a moral conclusion that has already\nbecome shared in a sufficiently inclusive and broad way (Richardson\n2018, chap. 7). \n",
