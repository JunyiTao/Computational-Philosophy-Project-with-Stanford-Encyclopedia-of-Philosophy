Problems\n\nThere is a lot of Croce\u2019s aesthetics that we have not discussed,\nincluding his criticisms of the discipline of Rhetoric (Aes.\n67\u201373; PPH 233\u201335), his disparagement of\n\u2018genre criticism\u2019\u2014that is, his doctrine that there\nare ultimately no aesthetic differences amongst different kinds of art\n(Aes. 111\u201317, EA 53\u201360, PPH\n229\u201333)\u2014and his condemnation of psychological and other\nnaturalistic views of art (Aes.87\u201393; EA\n41\u20137). There is also his magnificent if contentious\npr\u00e9cis of the history of aesthetics (Aes.\n155\u2013474). But these are points of relative detail; the theory is\nwhole is sufficiently well before us now to conclude by mentioning\nsome general lines of criticism.\n",
