    "main_text": "Applications || Bioethics\n8. Conclusion\n\n\nFor more than two decades, feminist philosophy has had a productive\nbut sometimes uneasy engagement with the facts and theory of\ndisability. Some feminists who view feminist theorizing from a\ndisability perspective, such as Morris and Wendell, are disturbed by\nevidence that feminism has not overcome a residual allegiance to\nnormalcy. And indeed some discussions of disability by feminists seem\nto proceed by laying aside feminism's own affiliations with\nliberation, self-affirmation, and inclusiveness. In general, however,\nphilosophy has benefited from applying feminism's theoretical lenses\nto better understand disability. Polishing those lenses with the cloth\nof which disabled people's lives are made promises to achieve more\nfinely nuanced and perspicacious philosophical accounts, and theories\nbroader in scope and farther seeing, than during the centuries when\nphilosophy overlooked disability.\n",
