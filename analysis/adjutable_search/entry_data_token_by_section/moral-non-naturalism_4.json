    "main_text": "Motivation\n5. Motivation\n\n\nIt is often held that moral goodness has a kind of \u201cmagnetism.\u201d\nIntuitively, the recognition of moral properties like goodness bears\nsome sort of intimate connection to motivation\u2014not in the sense of\nbeing sufficiently motivated by such recognition that one actually does the relevant thing\nbut in the sense of being motivated to some degree to do it. The\ngeneral idea that there is some intimate connection between moral\njudgement and motivation is usually referred to as \u201cjudgement\ninternalism.\u201d (see Darwall 1983: 54). It is not obvious how the\nnon-naturalist can explain how the recognition of moral properties can\nmotivate. Mackie famously argues that the defender of objective values\nmust implausibly maintain that moral properties have a kind of special\ncausal power to motivate people simply in virtue of their recognition\nof them. He argues that the recognition of moral properties must have a\nsort of direct influence on the will so that anyone who recognizes them\nis thereby motivated. Since a property with this sort of causal power\nwould be unlike anything else with which we are familiar and fits\npoorly into our scientific conception of the world, Mackie argues that\nwe should not believe in such properties. Mackie\u2019s official target is\nthe thesis that moral properties are objective, but it is clear from\nhis discussion that non-naturalist interpretations of moral properties\nare supposed to be especially vulnerable to his line of argument.\nIndeed, Mackie\u2019s argument seems to have two stages. First, he in effect\nargues that any plausible interpretation of our pre-theoretical beliefs\nabout morality will presuppose non-naturalism. Second, he argues that\nnon-naturalism is itself untenable.\n The non-naturalist has a number of possible replies to Mackie\u2019s\nobjection. First, the non-naturalist might simply deny that moral\nproperties are motivating in Mackie\u2019s sense. Mackie\u2019s argument seems\nto \u201cload up\u201d the concept of a moral property with a lot of\nbaggage that the non-naturalist need not accept. After all, some\npeople seem to make perfectly sound moral judgements but remain\nunmoved to action by them.  Some people care about morality and other\npeople do not; one need not ascribe any mysterious motivational power\nto moral properties to explain why moral properties motivate when they\ndo (see, e.g., Savavarsdottir 1999). This reply is fair enough so far\nas Mackie\u2019s initial challenge goes, but it does suggest another\nrelated problem. For now we need some account of why some people care\nabout morality and other people do not, since it is clear enough that\nthis depends in some way on the person\u2019s environment and\nconstitution. The non-naturalist may well be able to give such an\naccount but neither will this be a trivial task.\n\n\nSecond, the non-naturalist might argue that the motivating power of\nmoral judgements is a trifling semantic truth rather than a deep\nmetaphysical one. On this account, moral judgements are individuated\nnot just in terms of their content but in terms of the motivations of\nthe person making the judgement (see Tresan 2006, though he develops this approach on behalf of naturalism). So on this account someone who\nrecognizes the property of goodness but is completely unmoved by it\ndoes not thereby have a moral belief. Only when the person has the\nappropriate motivations does the belief count as moral. It is unclear,\nhowever, whether this account adequately meets the objection insofar\nas it leaves it a mystery why we should individuate moral beliefs in\njust this way. Intuitively, it is something about the special nature\nof the content of moral judgement that explains why they are\naction-guiding, but on this account the content need not play any role\nwhatsoever in the explanation.\n\n\nA third reply to Mackie is similar to the second one but tries to\nimprove on it by offering an explanation of the relationship between\nthe content of a moral judgement and the appropriate motivation. The\ngeneral idea is that moral properties can be recognized only by someone\nwith certain motivations. It might be held that one cannot recognize\nsomething as cruel, for example, unless one disapproves of it (at least\na little bit) and that cruelty is a non-natural moral property. This\nproposal differs from the second one in that it holds that moral\njudgements are individuated entirely in terms of their content and not\neven partly in terms of their motivational context. It just claims that\njudgements with certain contents cannot be made without certain\nmotivational states (see, e.g., McDowell 1998). Whereas the second\nsuggestion was semantic (\u201cmotivation on the cheap,\u201d one might say),\nthis reply is in part metaphysical and requires substantial work in the\nphilosophy of mind. In adopting this strategy, the non-naturalist takes\non the burden of explaining why judgements with a distinctively moral\ncontent require appropriate motivations and this is likely to be no\neasy task. Cruelty, for example, presumably is a moral concept but\nintuitively someone can believe that an action would be cruel and\nsimply not give a damn. Indeed, intuitively it seems possible for\nsomeone to take the cruelty of an action to be an attractive feature or\na reason to perform the action\u2014schoolyard bullies nicely illustrate\nthis possibility (a similar point is made in Blackburn 1998: 100) . Nor\ndoes the thesis that cruelty is a non-natural property make the defense\nof this view in the philosophy of mind any easier.\n\n\nMackie\u2019s objection relies on the highly controversial premise that\nmoral judgements necessarily are motivating and as we have seen the\nnon-naturalist might reasonably just deny that premise (that was the\nfirst of the three replies discussed above). However, one might instead\nappeal to the much more modest premise that if an agent judges that\nsome possible action of hers is morally required then she will be\nmotivated to perform that action unless she is practically\nirrational. Michael Smith refers to this as the \u201cpracticality\nrequirement on moral judgement\u201d (see Smith 1994: 61). This requirement\nseems plausible because the recognition that an action is right\nplausibly is the recognition that the action is well-supported (perhaps\nconclusively supported) by justifying moral reasons for action, and\nsuch a recognition should motivate someone unless the agent is\npractically irrational. For present purposes, the point is that even if\nMackie\u2019s challenge can be bypassed or met in one of the three ways just\ndiscussed, a further challenge concerning motivation still faces the\nnon-naturalist. For if the practicality requirement on moral judgement\nis correct then the non-naturalist needs to provide some account of why\nan agent\u2019s recognition that one of the actions available to her has the\nnon-natural property of rightness is such that her recognition of this\nfact rationally requires that she be motivated to perform the\naction.  In particular, some account of why judging that something is well supported by reasons (understood in non-naturalist terms) is appropriately connected to motivation.\n\n\nIf either of the last two replies to Mackie\u2019s objection works then\nit can be redeployed against this objection. For if either of those\nreplies works then the non-naturalist can explain why the relevant\nmoral judgements necessarily are motivating, which trivially entails\nthat anyone who makes the relevant moral judgements either is\nappropriately motivated or is practically irrational. If, for example,\nit is an analytic truth that a judgment does not count as moral unless\nit is appropriately motivating then it trivially follows that anyone\nwho accepts a moral judgment is appropriately motivated or is\npractically irrational simply because it follows that anyone who\naccepts such a judgment is appropriately motivated. However, these\nstrategies are problematic in part for just the reason that Mackie\u2019s\nversion of internalism is problematic\u2014both seem to make a certain\nkind of practical irrationality impossible by asserting that making a\nmoral judgment guarantees appropriate motivation. In particular, it\nseems possible, though irrational, for an agent to judge that he is\nrequired to do something and yet not be motivated at all to do it. So\nperhaps non-naturalists should instead either try to accommodate\nSmith\u2019s practicality requirement on moral judgement without committing\nthemselves to a form of judgement internalism as strong as the one\nMackie seemed to have in mind or argue against the practicality\nrequirement. Of course, if Smith\u2019s practicality requirement on moral\njudgement is sound then accommodating it is a challenge faced by every\nmeta-ethical theory, but consideration of how the requirement might be\naccommodated suggests that the problem is especially pronounced for the\nnon-naturalist.\n\n\nThe non-naturalist could simply deny the practicality requirement on\nmoral judgement (this would be similar to the first reply to Mackie\u2019s\nobjection). This is considerably more controversial than denying the\nvery strong link between motivation and moral judgement presupposed by\nMackie\u2019s objection, but may nonetheless be defensible. The idea would\nbe that an agent can judge that she is morally required to do something\nand not be motivated accordingly without being guilty of any kind of\nirrationality. One might hold this on the grounds that the belief that\none is morally required to do something does not commit one to the\nbelief that there is conclusive reason to do it or on the grounds that\nthe belief that there is conclusive reason for one to do something\nsimply does not commit one to being motivated to do it on pain of\nirrationality. Unfortunately, a full discussion of the issues\nsurrounding the truth of the practicality requirement on moral\njudgement goes beyond the present scope. For useful discussion, see\nBrink 1986, Foot 1972 and Smith 1994.\n\n\nAlternatively, the non-naturalist might maintain that the\npracticality requirement on motivation is a trifling semantic truth.\nThe idea would be that to be fully rational in part just means\ndoing what one believes to be right. However, this move differs from\nthe second reply considered above in that it is a clear attempt to\ndefine a normative notion (rationality) in purely naturalistic terms.\nThis last claim assumes we can give a naturalistic account of\nrationality, which is not obviously correct given non-naturalism about\nrightness, but neither is it obviously incorrect. In any event, such an\nanalysis of rationality sits poorly with the non-naturalist\u2019s standard\nappeal to the Open Question Argument. For if the Open Question Argument\nis sound for moral predicates like \u2018morally required\u2019 then\none might have thought that analogous arguments would go through for\n\u2018rational\u2019 and \u2018irrational\u2019. After all,\nrationality is plausibly a normative notion and on some accounts (see above) it is the idea of\nnormativity that gives the Open Question Argument its force. This is\none reason the practicality requirement on moral judgement is\nespecially a problem for non-naturalists, since naturalists are not\ncommitted to accepting the soundness of the Open Question Argument in\nthe moral case.\n\n\nFinally, a more recent reply to such objections form motivation is that they misunderstand the role of the relevant non-natural properties in the motivational economy of a virtuous agent.  On this view (defended in Chappell 2019), the virtuous agent is not motivated by some simple non-natural property like goodness.  That, on this view, would be a sort of fetishism.  Rather, the virtuous agent is motivated by the purely natural facts that make the action morally right, e.g. that it spares someone emotional distress.  The role of the relevant non-natural property, here the property of being a reason for a given action, is to mark  the relevant properties as the ones it is correct to be motivated by.  One reply to this argument is suggested by Max Hayward (Hayward 2019). Hayward argues that our commitment to e.g. the value of our partner should not be conditional on the existence and distribution of non-natural properties.  Yet non-naturalist moral realism is committed to the view that all value is contingent on the existence of such properties.  Transposed to Chappell\u2019s emphasis on normative properties as markers of our reasons, Hayward\u2019s argument would imply the correctness of treating the relevant facts as reasons should not depend on the sort of obscure metaphysics posited by non-naturalist moral realists.\n",
