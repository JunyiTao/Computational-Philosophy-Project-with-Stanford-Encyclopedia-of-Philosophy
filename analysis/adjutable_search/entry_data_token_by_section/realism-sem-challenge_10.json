    "main_text": "Realist Responses || Models and Reality\n4.4 Models and Reality\n\nIf metaphysical realism is to be tenable, it must be possible for even\nthe best theories to be mistaken. Or so metaphysical realists have\nthought. Whence, such realists reject the Model-Theoretic Argument MTA\nwhich purports to show that this is not possible. Here is an informal\nsketch of the MTA due to van Fraassen [1997]:\n\nLet \\(T\\) be a theory that contains all the sentences we insist are\ntrue, and that has all other qualities we desire in an ideal theory.\nSuppose moreover that there are infinitely many things, and that \\(T\\)\nsays so. Then there exist functions (interpretations) which assign to\neach term in \\(T\\)\u2019s vocabulary an extension, and which satisfy\n\\(T\\). So we conclude, to quote Putnam, \u201c\\(T\\) comes out true,\ntrue of the world, provided we just interpret \u2018true\u2019 as\nTRUE(SAT)\u201d.\n\n\nHere \u2018TRUE(SAT)\u2019 means \u201ctrue relative to a mapping\nof the terms of the language of \\(T\\) onto (sets of) items in the\nworld\u201d.\n\nBut why should we interpret \u2018true\u2019 as TRUE(SAT)? Because\ntruth is truth in an intended model and, Putnam argues, amongst all\nthe models of \\(T\\) that make all its theses come out true there is\nguaranteed to be at least one that passes all conceivable constraints\nwe can reasonably impose on a model in order for it to be an intended\nmodel of \\(T\\). \n\nRealists have responded to the argument by rejecting the claim that a\nmodel \\(M\\) of the hypothetical ideal theory \\(T\\) passes every\ntheoretical constraint simply because all of the theory\u2019s theses\ncome out true in it. For there is no guarantee, they claim, that terms\nstand in the right relation of reference to the objects to which \\(M\\)\nlinks them. To be sure, if we impose another theoretical constraint,\nsay:\n\nRight Reference Constraint (RRC): Term \\(t\\) refers to object \\(x\\) if\nand only if \\(Rtx\\) where \\(R\\) is the right relation of reference,\n\n\nthen \\(M\\) (or some model based on it) can interpret this RRC\nconstraint in such a way as to make it come out true.\n\nBut there is a difference between a model\u2019s making some\ndescription of a constraint come out true and its actually conforming\nto that constraint, metaphysical realists insist [Devitt 1983, 1991;\nLewis 1983, 1984].\n\nFor their part, anti-realists have taken the metaphysical\nrealist\u2019s insistence on a Right Reference Constraint to be\n\u2018just more theory\u2019\u2014what it is for a model to conform\nto a constraint is for us to be justified in asserting that it does.\nUnfortunately, this has led to something of a stand-off. Metaphysical\nrealists think that anti-realists are refusing to acknowledge a clear\nand important distinction. Anti-realists think realists are simply\nfalling back on dogmatism at a crucial point in the argument.\n\nOn the face of it, the Permutation Argument presents a genuine\nchallenge to any realist who believes in determinate reference. But it\ndoes not refute metaphysical realism unless such realism is committed\nto determinate reference in the first place and it is not at all\nobvious that this is so.\n\nRealist responses to this argument vary widely. At one extreme are the\n\u2018determinatists\u2019, those who believe that Nature has set up\nsignificant, determinate referential connections between our mental\nsymbols and items in the world. They contend that all the argument\nshows is that the distribution of truth-values across possible worlds\nis not sufficient to determine reference [van Cleve 1992].\n\nAt another extreme are \u2018indeterminatists\u2019, realists who\nconcede the conclusion, agreeing that it demonstrates that word-world\nreference is massively indeterminate or \u2018inscrutable\u2019. The\nlocus classicus for inscrutability of reference is Quine 1964 [See\nalso Quine 1969, 1992; Davidson 1979]. \n\nSome infer from this that reference could not possibly consist in\ncorrespondences between mental symbols and objects in the world. For\nthem all that makes \u2018elephant\u2019 refer to elephants is that\nour language contains the word \u2018elephant\u2019. This is\nDeflationism about reference. Vann McGee presents a strong case for\ninscrutability on a deflationary view of reference, one that is\ngrounded in a \u201c\u2026 peculiarly egocentric conception of\nsemantics\u2014questions of others\u2019 meanings are settled by\nasking what I mean by the words of my language\u201d [McGee\n2015].\n\nIn between these two extremes are those prepared to concede the\nargument establishes the real possibility of a significant and\nsurprising indeterminacy in the reference of our mental symbols but\nwho take it to be an open question whether other constraints can be\nfound which pare down the range of reference assignments to just the\nintuitively acceptable\n ones.[7]\n\n\nThe simplest and most direct response to the MTA questions its\nvalidity. Thus Devitt and Lewis claim that Putnam\u2019s alternative\nmodel \\(M\\) has not been shown to satisfy every theoretical\nconstraint merely by making some description of each\ntheoretical constraint true.\n\nSkolem\u2019s Paradox in set theory seems to present a striking\nillustration of Lewis\u2019s distinction. The L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\nTheorem states that every consistent, countable set of first-order\nformulae has a denumerable model, in fact a model in the set of\nintegers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Now in ZF one can prove the existence of sets\nwith a non-denumerable number of elements such as the set\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) of real numbers. Yet the ZF axioms comprise a\nconsistent, countable set of first-order formulae and thus by the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem has a model in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). So\nZF\u2019s theorem \\(\\phi\\) stating that \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is\nnon-denumerable will come out true in a denumerable model \\(\\mu\\) of\nZF.\n\nHow can this be? One explanation is that \\(\\mu\\) makes \\(\\phi\\) true\nonly at the cost of re-interpreting the term\n\u2018non-denumerable\u2019 so that it no longer means\nnon-denumerable. Thus \\(\\mu\\) is not the intended model\n\\(M^*\\) of ZF. It looks as if the metaphysical realist has a clear\nillustration of Lewis\u2019s distinction at hand in set theory.\n\nUnfortunately for the realist, this is not the only explanation. In\nfact, Putnam used this very example in an early formulation of the\nMTA. Just because there are different models that satisfy \\(\\phi\\) in\nsome of which \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is non-denumerable but in others of which\n(such as \\(\\mu\\)) \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is denumerable, Putnam argued, it is\nimpossible to pin down the intended interpretation of\n\u2018set\u2019 via first-order axioms. Moreover, well before\nPutnam, Skolem and his followers had taken the moral of Skolem\u2019s\nParadox to be that set-theoretic notions are indeterminate [For\nfurther discussion, see the entry on\n Skolem\u2019s paradox].\n\nThe question of how to interpret Skolem\u2019s Paradox merely raises\nanew the question of what it is for a theory such as the hypothesized\nideal theory \\(T\\) to satisfy a right reference constraint, (RRC).\n\nPutnam [1985] regards it as simply question-begging for a realist to\nassume her notion of an intended model is determinate: i.e. that terms\nsuch as \u2018satisfaction\u2019 or \u2018correspondence\u2019\nrefer to those relations to which she wishes them to refer. That her\nterm \u2018refers\u2019 refers to her desired reference relation is\n\u2018just more theory\u2019. Realists have responded that Putnam is\nwilfully re-interpreting their semantic terms as he sees\n fit.[8]\n\n\nIs there some independent way to validate Lewis\u2019s distinction?\nMichael Resnick thinks so [Resnick 1987]. Putnam maintained that\n\\(M\\), the model he constructs of the ideal theory \\(T\\), is an\nintended model because it passes every operational and theoretical\nconstraint we could reasonably impose. It passes every theoretical\nconstraint, he argues, simply because it makes every thesis of \\(T\\)\ntrue. But unless the Reflection Principle (RP) below\nholds, Resnick argues, this inference is just a\nnon-sequitur:\n\n(RP) \nTo any condition \\(f\\) that a model of a theory satisfies, there\ncorresponds a condition \\(C\\) expressible in the theory that that\ntheory satisfies. \n\n\nHowever, this principle is false. The simplest counterexample to it,\nResnick points out, is Tarskian truth. Suppose we impose on\n\\(T\\)\u2019s model \\(M\\) a condition \\(f^*\\) that \\(M\\) makes all of\n\\(T\\)\u2019s theses come out true. Then, unless \\(T\\) is either\ninconsistent or too weak to express elementary arithmetic no truth\npredicate will be definable in \\(T\\). Whence there will be no\ncondition \\(C\\) expressible in \\(T\\) corresponding to this condition\n\\(f^*\\) on \\(T\\)\u2019s model(s) \\(M\\).\n\nResnick concludes (ibid):\n\nAny true interpretation of \\(T\\) whatsoever\u2014even one which does\nnot satisfy \\(C\\)\u2014will make true every thesis of \\(T\\),\nincluding T\u2019s assertion that \\(C\\) is satisfied. Which suffices\nto block the \u2018just more theory\u2019 gambit.\n\n\nThe philosophical consensus appears to be that Lewis and Resnick are\nright. Apart from the authors already discussed, important criticisms\nof the MTA were advanced in Hale and Wright 1997, van Cleve 1992 and\nBays 2008. However, some very sophisticated anti-realist attempts to\nbuttress the Model-Theoretic Argument against Lewis-styled criticisms\nhave appeared. Igor Douven reconstructs Putnam\u2019s argument,\ndefending it against standard objections [Douven 1999]. Barry Taylor\npresents a detailed explication and defence of Putnam\u2019s Just\nMore Theory reply [Taylor 2006], as does Tim Button [Button 2013].\nWhether these newer formulations of the MTA succeed in answering the\nLewis/Resnick objection is an open\n question.[9]\n\n",
