Stage two: establishment and consolidation\n\nThe first phase of Africana philosophy\u2019s emergence eventually\ngives way to a period of establishment and consolidation for the field\nas a field. During this time the themes and concerns from the earlier\nphilosophies born of struggle, inflected by regional concerns, make\ntheir way into the orbit of professional philosophy. Along the way,\nthey get translated into the distinctive vocabularies of the\ndiscipline\u2019s subfields and methodological schools, creatively\nexpanding those vocabularies in the process. (Or they acknowledge the\npossibility of this translation and resist or complicate it.)\n\nWe can say that the first phase ends and emergence gives way to\nestablishment when the field begins to get traction among teachers and\nresearchers in academic philosophy. Kwasi Wiredu explains in his\nclassic Companion to African Philosophy that this\ndidn\u2019t begin to happen in African universities until the middle\nto late sixties, as independence ushered in \u201csignificant numbers\nof post-independence African academics\u201d (Wiredu 2004, 2).\nSimilarly, Outlaw points out that the field has become more\nestablished as \u201csuccessive generations of persons of African\ndescent have entered the profession\u201d in the wake of anti-racist\nliberation struggles, and as these persons organized conferences and\nother mechanisms for networking and scholarly exchange, often across\nnational and regional boundaries (Outlaw 2017, \u00a710, par. 2).\n\nIf establishment begins with the arrival of Wiredu\u2019s and\nOutlaw\u2019s academics, it reaches its apex in the 1980s. This is\nthe point at which a number of germinal contributions make their way\ninto print. Think here of Richard A. Wright\u2019s African\nPhilosophy: An Introduction (1984), Cornel West\u2019s\nProphesy Deliverance! (1982), Angela Davis\u2019s Women,\nRace, and Class (1983), the first edition of Leonard\nHarris\u2019s Philosophy Born of Struggle (1983), V. Y.\nMudimbe\u2019s The Invention of Africa (1988), and Edouard\nGlissant\u2019s Caribbean Discourses (1989).\n\nThe 1990s and early 2000s were the years of consolidation. This is the\npoint at which a wave of more securely positioned scholarly\nprofessionals produced work destined for wider influence than the work\nof the previous era. Think here of Kwame Anthony Appiah\u2019s In\nMy Father\u2019s House (1993), Charles W. Mills\u2019s The\nRacial Contract (1997), Lucius T. Outlaw Jr.\u2019s On Race\nand Philosophy (1996), Lewis R. Gordon\u2019s Bad Faith and\nAntiblack Racism (1995), Paget Henry\u2019s Caliban\u2019s\nReason (2000), Kwame Gyekye\u2019s Tradition and\nModernity (1997), the first edition of Patricia Hill\nCollins\u2019s Black Feminist Thought (1990), and the\nrevised edition of Bernard R. Boxill\u2019s Blacks and Social\nJustice (1992).\n\nAs Africana philosophy becomes a professionally recognized field (as\nopposed to a vibrant but heterodox enterprise or tradition,\noverlapping only slightly with mainstream knowledge production), the\nwork begins, one might say, to riff on the discipline\u2019s accepted\nmovements and schools. Africana professional philosophers put\nmainstream professional resources into conversation with many of the\nconcerns and innovations that animated the earlier philosophies born\nof struggle. Far from simply applying sophisticated resources to\npre-philosophical raw material, this exercise at its best blends two\nmodes of philosophical reflection. One enjoys mainstream recognition,\nwhile the other benefits from testing and refinement by application in\nareas that its counterpart ignores; and each can, in principle,\ncompensate for shortcomings in the other. What results is work that\noften\u2014as Moten, following Robinson, says of Black radical\nMarxism\u2014involves both \u201cretention and disruption,\noriginality and response\u201d (Moten 2017,\n 9\u201310).[3]\n (It is also what one might say of the difference that Afro-diasporic\nmusical practices made in and to European traditions, producing new\nforms like samba and jazz along the way. Hence the appeal to\n\u201criffing.\u201d)\n\nUnderstanding this transformative, improvisational relationship is a\nprecondition to properly locating the contributions to the periods of\nemergence and consolidation. With this in mind one can acknowledge\nthat Davis and Outlaw both contribute to and draw from the tradition\nof critical theory, without diminishing either their originality or\ntheir traditional fluency. In similar ways, West and Harris riff on\nthe pragmatist tradition, Mudimbe and Glissant creatively appropriate\nand employ post-structuralist resources, Gordon and Henry, following\nWilliam R. Jones and\n others,[4]\n develop an Africana form of existential phenomenology, and Appiah and\nBoxill represent Africana thought in an analytic key.\n\nI\u2019ll somewhat arbitrarily nominate 2003\u20132004 as the cutoff\nbetween the period of consolidation and the contemporary moment. These\nyears saw the publication of Tommy L. Lott and John P. Pittman\u2019s\nCompanion to African-American Philosophy and Wiredu\u2019s\nCompanion to African Philosophy. I would say of both volumes\nsomething like what Afolayan and Falola say of the Wiredu volume: that\nthey constitute \u201ca significant nod to the appearance of\nAfrican[a] philosophy in \u2026 global academe\u201d (Afolayan and\nFalola 2017, 1).\n",
