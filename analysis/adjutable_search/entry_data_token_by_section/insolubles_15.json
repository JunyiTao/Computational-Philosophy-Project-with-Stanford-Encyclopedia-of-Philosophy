    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century || William Heytesbury\n3.4 William Heytesbury\n\nIn 1335, the Mertonian logician and philosopher of nature William\nHeytesbury wrote an important treatise entitled Rules for Solving\nSophisms (Regulae solvendi\n sophismata).[26]\n The first of its six chapters is on insolubles. The Rules as\na whole, and this first chapter in particular, were widely read and\ncommented on, particularly in Italy in the late-fourteenth and\nfifteenth centuries (see, e.g.,\n Section 4.4\n below). Indeed, Heytesbury\u2019s theory is a competitor to\nBradwardine\u2019s as the most influential theory of insolubles in\nthe whole of the Middle\n Ages.[27]\n\nHeytesbury treated insolubles as paradoxical only with respect\nto certain assumed circumstances (what he calls the\ncasus or \u201cscenario\u201d). For example, the\nproposition \u2018Socrates is uttering a falsehood\u2019 is not\nparadoxical in the abstract, all by itself, but only in contexts\nwhere, say, it is Socrates who utters that proposition, the\nproposition is the only proposition Socrates utters (it is\nnot an embedded quotation, for instance, part of some larger statement\nhe is making), and where his proposition signifies just as it normally\ndoes. Spoken and written language are thoroughly arbitrary, for\nmedieval authors, so that the vocal sequence or inscription\n\u2018Socrates is uttering a falsehood\u2019 could theoretically\nsignify any way you want. It might, for example, signify that 2 + 2 =\n4, in which case it would not be insoluble at all but\nstraightforwardly true.\n\nIt is the last condition that is the focal point for\nHeytesbury\u2019s attack. He holds that in the casus where\nSocrates himself says just \u2018Socrates is uttering a\nfalsehood\u2019 and nothing else, his proposition cannot, on\npain of contradiction, signify just as it normally does\n(precise sicut verba communiter pretendunt, as he puts it).\nIf it does signify as it normally does, it must signify some other way\nas well.\n\nHow else might it signify? Heytesbury did not think it was up to him\nto answer that question, as Bradwardine had. The proposition\u2019s\nadditional signification cannot be predicted, given the arbitrariness\nof spoken and written language. Depending on what else it signifies,\ndifferent verdicts about the proposition are appropriate. In short,\nHeytesbury\u2019s strategy is to say,\n\n\nYou tell me exactly what Socrates\u2019s statement\nsignifies, and I\u2019ll tell you first of all whether the case you\ndescribe is possible, and if it is, I\u2019ll tell you whether his\nstatement is true or false.\n\n\nThis \u201cshift the burden\u201d strategy is a consequence of the\nfact that Heytesbury, even more than Bradwardine and Swyneshed, views\nthe question of insolubles in the context of obligationes, a\nhighly formalized medieval disputation context that is a subject of\nmuch recent\n discussion.[28]\n But Heytesbury shares one claim at least with Bradwardine: that no\nproposition, in a suitable scenario, can signify only and precisely\nthat it itself is false. It must signify something more than just\nthis. See Heytesbury [H-OI] \u00a750 and Bradwardine [B-I] \u00a7\nA4.3.\n",
