    "main_text": "Primary Ideas and a Principle of Representation\n4. Primary Ideas and a Principle of Representation\n\nSome scholars believe that in Descartes\u2019 brief discussion of\nprimary ideas there is suggested a principle of representation (Wilson\n1978, Clatterbaugh 1980, Chappell 1986, Smith 2005a, 2010a). The\nprinciple is notoriously difficult to formulate, and there is no\nconsensus among scholars as to how it is best understood. However, a\nlarge number of scholars agree on one component of the principle,\nwhich can be expressed as a necessary (though not a sufficient)\ncondition for representation. This principle of representation\n(PR) can be expressed as follows:\n\n(PR) Primary idea A represents object B only if the objective\nreality of idea A has its origin in the formal reality of object B.\n\n\nPR is at work in Descartes\u2019 analyses of all primary\nideas, which includes all innate and adventitious ideas. The innate\nidea of his (i.e., Descartes\u2019) mind is said to be of or\nto represent his mind insofar as the idea\u2019s objective\nreality has its origin in the formal reality of his mind. The innate\nidea of God is said to represent God insofar as the idea\u2019s\nobjective reality has its origin in the formal reality of God (an\ninfinite substance). The innate idea of a body is said to represent a\nbody insofar as the idea\u2019s objective reality has its origin in\nthe formal reality of a corporeal substance. The adventitious idea of\nthe Sun is said to represent the Sun insofar as the idea\u2019s\nobjective reality has its origin in the formal reality of the Sun. And\nthe list could go on. \n\nThe following analogy may be instructive. Suppose that Socrates stands\nbefore a mirror. Both Socrates and the mirror are actual things, so\nboth, using Descartes\u2019 terminology, would possess formal\nreality. Each can presumably exist independently of the other. The\nimage of Socrates arises as a relation between Socrates and\nthe mirror. It cannot exist independently of Socrates or the mirror.\nDestroy Socrates or the mirror, and this image of Socrates is\ndestroyed. Using Descartes\u2019 terminology, the image is\nan objective being insofar as it is a representation of\nSocrates. Although the image represents Socrates, it is nevertheless\n\u201clocated\u201d on the mirror\u2019s surface. And, since the\nsurface is a mode of the mirror, there is a sense in which this image\nwould be too. The mirror is the bearer of the image. This is a sense\nin which the image \u201cbelongs to\u201d the mirror. The\nrelationship to Socrates is different. The image is said to be an\nimage of Socrates. The image is about him. He is not\nthe bearer of the image, but is what this image represents.\nSo, the relation that Socrates has to this image must be importantly\ndifferent from the relation that the mirror has to this image.\nEmploying Descartes\u2019 terminology, and in light of PR, the\nimage is of Socrates insofar as this objective being (the\nimage) has its origin in the formal reality of Socrates. To be sure,\nthe image derives its existence, or its formal reality, from the\nformal reality of the mirror, but its objective being has its origin\nnot in the mirror but in Socrates. \n",
