    "main_text": "Computational Philosophy by Example || Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy of Mind\n3.6 Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy of Mind\n\nThe Dartmouth conference of 1956 is standardly taken as marking the\ninception of both the field and the term \u201cartificial\nintelligence\u201d (AI). There were, however, two distinct\ntrajectories apparent in that conference. Some of the participants\ntook as their goal to be the development of intelligent or thinking\nmachines, with perhaps an understanding of human processing as a\nbegrudging means to that end. Others took their goal to be a\nphilosophical and psychological understanding of human processing,\nwith the development of machines a means to that end. Those in the\nfirst group were quick to exploit linear programming: what came to be\nknown as \u201cGOFAI\u201d, or \u201cgood old-fashioned artificial\nintelligence\u201d. Those in the second group rejoiced when\nconnectionist and neural net architectures came to maturity several\ndecades later, promising models directly built on and perhaps\nreflective of mechanisms in the human brain (Churchland 1995).\n\nAttempts to understand perception, conceptualization, belief change,\nand intelligence are all part of philosophy of mind. The use of\ncomputational models toward that end\u2014the second strand\nabove\u2014thus comes close to computational philosophy of mind.\nDaniel Dennett has come close to saying that AI is philosophy\nof mind: \u201ca most abstract inquiry into the possibility of\nintelligence or knowledge\u201d (Dennett 1979: 60; Bringsjord &\nGovindarajulu 2018 [2019]).\n\nThe bulk of AI research remains strongly oriented toward producing\neffective and profitable information processing, whether or not the\nresult offers philosophical understanding. So it is perhaps better not\nto identify AI with philosophy of mind, though AI has often been\nguided by philosophical conceptions and aspects of AI have proven\nfruitful for philosophical exploration. Philosophy of AI and\nphilosophy of mind inspired by and in response to\nAI, which are not the topic here, have both been far more common than\nphilosophy of mind developed with the techniques of AI.\n\nOne example of a program in artificial intelligence that was\nexplicitly conceived in philosophical terms and designed for\nphilosophical ends was the OSCAR project, developed by John Pollock\nbut cut short by his death (Pollock 1989, 1995, 2006). The goal of\nOSCAR was construction of a computational agent: an \u201cartificial\nintellect\u201d. At the core of OSCAR was implementation of a theory\nof rationality. Pollock was explicit regarding the intersection of AI\nand philosophy of mind in that project: \n\n\nThe implementability of a theory of rationality is a necessary\ncondition for its correctness. This amounts to saying that philosophy\nneeds AI just as much as AI needs philosophy. (Pollock 1995: xii;\nBringsjord & Govindarajulu 2018 [2019])\n\n\nAt the core of OSCAR\u2019s rationality is implementation of\ndefeasible non-monotonic logic employing prima facie reasons and\npotential defeaters. Among its successes, Pollock claims an ability to\nhandle the lottery paradox and preface paradoxes. Informally, the fact\nthat we know that one of the many tickets in a lottery will win means\nthat we must treat \u201cticket 1 will not win\u2026\u201d,\n\u201cticket 2 will not win\u2026\u201d and the like not as items\nof knowledge but as defeasible beliefs for which we have strong prima\nfacie reasons. Pollock\u2019s formal treatment in terms of collective\ndefeat is nicely outlined in a supplement on OSCAR in Bringsjord &\nGovindarajulu (2018 [2019]).\n",
