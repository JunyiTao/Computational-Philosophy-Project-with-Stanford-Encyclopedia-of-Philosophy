    "main_text": "Love as Valuing\n4. Love as Valuing\n\nA third kind of view of love understands love to be a distinctive mode\nof valuing a person. As the distinction between eros and\nagape in\n Section 1\n indicates, there are at least two ways to construe this in terms of\nwhether the lover values the beloved because she is valuable, or\nwhether the beloved comes to be valuable to the lover as a result of\nher loving him. The former view, which understands the lover as\nappraising the value of the beloved in loving him, is the\ntopic of\n Section 4.1,\n whereas the latter view, which understands her as bestowing\nvalue on him, will be discussed in\n Section 4.2.\n",
