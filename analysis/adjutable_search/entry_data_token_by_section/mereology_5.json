    "main_text": "Decomposition Principles || Supplementation\n3.1 Supplementation\n\nLet us begin with the first sort of extension. And let us start by\ntaking a closer look at the intuition according to which a whole\ncannot be decomposed into a single proper part. There are various ways\nin which one can try to capture this intuition. Consider the following\n(from Simons 1987: 26\u201328):\n\n\n(P.4a)\nCompany\n\nPPxy \u2192 \u2203z(PPzy \u2227\n\u00acz=x) \n\n(P.4b)\nStrong Company\n\nPPxy \u2192 \u2203z(PPzy \u2227\n\u00acPzx) \n\n(P.4)\nSupplementation[13]\n\nPPxy \u2192 \u2203z(Pzy \u2227\n\u00acOzx).  \n\n\nThe first principle, (P.4a), is a literal rendering of the\nidea in question: every proper part must be accompanied by another.\nHowever, there is an obvious sense in which (P.4a) only\ncaptures the letter of the idea, not the spirit: it rules out the\nunintended model mentioned above (see Figure 2, left) but not, for\nexample, an implausible model with an infinitely descending chain in\nwhich the additional proper parts do not leave any remainder at all\n(Figure 2, center). \n\nThe second principle, (P.4b), is stronger: it rules out\nboth models as unacceptable. However, (P.4b) is still too\nweak to capture the intended idea. For example, it is satisfied by a\nmodel in which a whole can be decomposed into several proper parts all\nof which overlap one another (Figure 2, right), and it may be argued\nthat such models do not do justice to the meaning of \u2018proper\npart\u2019: after all, the idea is that the removal of a proper part\nshould leave a remainder, but it is by no means clear what would be\nleft of x once z (along with its parts) is\nremoved.\n\n\nFigure 2. Three unsupplemented models. (Here and in\nthe diagrams below, connected lines going downwards represent proper\nextension relationships, i.e., the inverse of proper parthood. Thus,\nin all diagrams parthood behaves reflexively and transitively.)\n\n\nIt is only the third principle, (P.4), that appears to provide a full\nformulation of the idea that a whole cannot be decomposed into a\nsingle proper part. According to this principle, every proper part\nmust be \u201csupplemented\u201d by another, disjoint part,\nand it is this last qualification that captures the notion of a\nremainder. Should (P.4), then, be incorporated into M\nas a further fundamental principle on the meaning of\n\u2018part\u2019? \n\nMost authors (beginning with Simons himself) would say so. Yet here\nthere is room for genuine disagreement. In fact, it is not difficult\nto conceive of mereological scenarios that violate not only (P.4), but\nalso (P.4b) and even (P.4a). A case in point\nwould be Brentano's (1933) theory of accidents, according to which a\nmind is a proper part of a thinking mind even though there is nothing\nto make up for the difference. (See Chisholm 1978, Baumgartner and\nSimons 1993.) Similarly, in Fine's (1982) theory of\nqua-objects, every basic object (John) qualifies as the only\nproper part of its incarnations (John qua philosopher, John\nqua husband, etc.). Another interesting example is provided\nby Whitehead's (1929) theory of extensive connection, where no\nboundary elements are included in the domain of quantification: on\nthis theory, a topologically closed region includes its open interior\nas a proper part in spite of there being no boundary elements to\ndistinguish them\u2014the domain only consists of extended regions.\n(See Clarke 1981 for a rigorous formulation, Randell et al.\n1992 for developments.) Finally, consider the view, arguably held by\nAquinas, according to which the human person survives physical death\nalong with her soul (see Brown 2005 and Stump 2006, pace\nToner 2009). On the understanding that persons are hylomorphic\ncomposites, and that two things cannot become one, the view implies\nthat upon losing her body a person will continue to exist,\npre-resurrection, with only one proper part\u2014the soul. (This is\nalso the view of some contemporary philosophers; see e.g. Oderberg\n2005 and Hershenov and Koch-Hershenov 2006.) Indeed, any case of\nmaterial coincidence resulting from mereological diminution, as in the\nStoic puzzle of Deon and Theon (Sedley 1982) and its modern variant of\nTibbles and Tib (Wiggins 1968), would seem to be at odds with\nSupplementation: after the diminution, there is nothing that makes up\nfor the difference between what was a proper part and the whole with\nwhich it comes to coincide, short of holding that the part has become\nidentical to the whole (Gallois 1998), or has ceased to exist (Burke\n1994), or did not exist in the first place (van Inwagen 1981). One may\nrely on the intuitive appeal of (P.4) to discard all of the above\ntheories and scenarios as implausible. But one may as well turn things\naround and regard the plausibility of such theories as a good reason\nnot to accept (P.4) unrestrictedly, as argued e.g. by D. Smith (2009),\nOderberg (2012), and Lowe (2013). As things stand, it therefore seems\nappropriate to regard such a principle as providing a minimal but\nsubstantive addition to (P.1)\u2013(P.3), one that goes beyond the\nbasic characterization of \u2018part\u2019 provided by\nM. We shall label the resulting mereological theory\nMM, for Minimal Mereology.\n\nActually MM is now redundant, as Supplementation\nturns out to entail Antisymmetry so long as parthood is transitive and\nreflexive: if x and y were proper parts of each\nother, contrary to (P.3), then every z that is part of one\nwould also be part of\u2014hence overlap\u2014the other, contrary to\n(P.4). For ease of reference, we shall continue to treat (P.3) as an\naxiom. But the entailment is worth emphasizing, for it explains why\nSupplementation tends to be explicitly rejected by those who\ndo not endorse Antisymmetry, over and above the more classical\nexamples mentioned above. For instance, whoever thinks that a statue\nand the corresponding lump of clay are part of each other will find\nSupplementation unreasonable: after all, such parts are coextensive;\nwhy should we expect anything to be left over when, say, the clay is\n\u201csubtracted\u201d from the statue? (Donnelly 2011: 230).\nIndeed, Supplementation has recently run into trouble also\nindependently of its link with Antisymmetry, especially in the context\nof time-travel and multilocation scenarios such as those already\nmentioned in connection with each of (P.1)\u2013(P.3) (see Effingham\nand Robson 2007, Gilmore 2007, Eagle 2010, Kleinschmidt 2011, Daniels\n2014). As a result, a question that is gaining increasing attention is\nwhether there are any ways of capturing the supplementation intuition\nthat are strong enough to rule out the models of Figure 2 and yet\nsufficiently weaker than (P.4) to be acceptable to those who do not\nendorse some M-axiom or other\u2014be it\nAntisymmetry, Transitivity, or Reflexivity.\n\nTwo sorts of answer may be offered in this regard (see e.g. Gilmore\n2016). The first is to weaken the Supplementation conditional by\nstrengthening the antecedent. For instance, one may simply rephrase\n(P.4) in terms of the stricter notion of proper parthood defined in\n(20\u2032), i.e., effectively:\n\n\n(P.4c)\nStrict Supplementation\n\n(Pxy \u2227 \u00acPyx) \u2192\n\u2203z(Pzy \u2227 \u00acOzx). \n\n\nIn M this is equivalent to (P.4). Yet it is logically\nweaker, and it is easy to see that this suffices to block the\nentailment of (P.3) even in the presence of (P.1)\u2013(P.2) (just\nconsider a two-element model with mutual parthood, as in Figure 3,\nleft). Still, (P.4c) is sufficiently stronger than\n(P.4a) and (P.4b) to rule out all three patterns\nin Figure 2, and it obviously preserves the spirit of (P.4)\u2014if\nnot the letter. The second sort of answer is to weaken Supplementation\nby adjusting the consequent. There are various ways of doing this, the\nmost natural of which appears to be the following:\n\n\n(P.4d)\nQuasi-supplementation\n\nPPxy \u2192 \u2203z\u2203w(Pzy\n\u2227 Pwy \u2227 \u00acOzw). \n\n\nAgain, this principle is stronger than (P.4a) and\n(P.4b), since it rules out all patterns in Figure 2, and in\nM it is equivalent to (P.4). Indeed,\n(P.4d) says, literally, that if something has a proper\npart, then it has at least two disjoint parts, which Simons\n(1987: 27) takes to express the same intuition captured by (P.4). Yet\n(P.4d) is logically weaker than (P.4), since it admits the\nnon-antisymmetric model in Figure 3, middle, and for that reason it\nmay be deemed more suitable in the context of theories that violate\n(P.3). Note also that (P.4d) does not admit the symmetric\nmodel on Figure 3, left, so in a way it is stronger than\n(P.4c). In another way, however, it is weaker, since it\nadmits the model in Figure 3, right, which (P.4c) rules out\n(and which someone who thinks that, say, the clay is part of the\nstatue, but not vice versa, might want to retain).\n\n\nFigure 3. More unsupplemented patterns.\n\n\nThere are other options, too. For instance, in some standard\ntreatments, the Supplementation principle (P.4) is formulated using\n\u2018PP\u2019 also in the consequent:\n\n\n(P.4\u2032)\nProper Supplementation\n\nPPxy \u2192 \u2203z(PPzy \u2227\n\u00acOzx). \n\n\nIn M this is once again equivalent to (P.4), but the\nequivalence depends on Reflexivity and Symmetry. Absent (P.1) or\n(P.2), (P.4\u2032) is logically stronger. Yet again one may rely on\nthe alternative definition of \u2018PP\u2019 to obtain variants of\n(P.4\u2032) that are stronger than (P.4c) and weaker than\n(P.4). Similarly for (P.4d), which may be further weakened\nor strengthened by tampering with the parthood predicates occurring in\nthe antecedent and in the consequent.\n",
