    "main_text": "Naturalizing Social Construction || The Social Construction of Representations\n3.1 The Social Construction of Representations\n\nIn talking about the construction of representations, we address the\nrange of mental states, group beliefs, scientific theories, and other\nrepresentations that express concepts or propositions. Such\nrepresentations are, among other things, the vehicles of our thought\nas well as the means by which we store, organize, and further our\nknowledge of the world, and we do this in virtue of their role as\nbearers of meaning. A number of commentators have noted that many\nprovocative constructionist claims are, in the first instance, claims\nthat some sort of representation is constructed (e.g. Andreasen 1998,\nHacking 1999, Haslanger 2012, Mallon 2004). Specifically, these are\nclaims that social causes produce or control the selection of some\nrepresentations with some meanings rather than others: for example,\nwhen Pickering (1984) writes of the construction of quarks or Laqueur\n(1990) suggests that sex is \u201cmade up,\u201d they seem to be\nmost directly addressing the process by which the theories of\nthe quark or theories of sex are produced, viz. they are\nshowing how a theory with one meaning was selected or endorsed rather\nthan another theory or no theory at all. Where we limit the objects of\nconstructionist claims to representations (such as theories), the\nclaims cease to be particularly metaphysically provocative though\ndetailed constructionist accounts of how certain representations came\nto be selected may still teach us much about science (e.g. Latour and\nWoolgar 1979l Collins and Pinch 2012).\n\nIn light of this, philosophers may be wont to diagnose some\nconstructionist talk as a careless (or even an intentionally\nprovocative) error of talking about the object of construction\nusing a representation when one should be mentioning\nit (thereby expressing a view about the referent of the representation\nrather than the representation itself). When Claudius Ptolemy offered\na geo-centric theory of the universe in the second century CE, he\nthereby contributed to the social construction of something: namely,\na geocentric theory of the universe. We can talk about how\nand when that theory arose, and how it changed over time, but in doing\nso we are simply talking about a representation (or perhaps a lineage\nof related representations). It would be a mistake simply to slip from\nthose claims into saying that in constructing this theory he thereby\nconstructed a geocentric universe. Hence, charity in\ninterpretation alone may suggest attributing only the weaker claim to\na constructionist\n author.[10]\n\nStill some constructionists endorse a stronger claim as\nwell\u2014that in constructing the theories, the facts described by\nthose theories are thereby made to be. But if we leave at least the\nglobal versions of these additional claims aside as impossible to\nreconcile with naturalism, the distinctive feature of social\nconstructionist explanations of representations is that they explain\nhow we came to have those representations not by reference to the\nfacts in the world they represent (as in realism), nor by reference to\nassociations among our sensations (as in some forms of empiricism),\nnor by reference to innate knowledge or concepts (as in rationalism),\nnor by reference to the conditions of our thought or experience (as in\ntranscendental arguments) but rather by reference to social and\ncultural background facts.\n\nNaturalist work on constructionist approaches to representations can\nbe grouped according to the debate the naturalist is addressing.\nNaturalists addressing the challenge posed by social construction to\nthe authority of science have attempted to respond to this challenge\nin a variety of ways that pit various versions of realism and\nempiricism against constructionism (e.g. Boyd 1992; see\n Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge).\n Because naturalists are typically committed to science as a central,\nif fallible, avenue of knowledge about the world (i.e. some variety of\nepistemic fundamentalism), naturalists will want to explain how this\ncan be if, as social constructionists about scientific representations\nnote, empirical observation is theory-laden and scientific theories\nare themselves subject to massive social influences.\n\nFor example, Jerry Fodor\u2019s account of the modularity of\nperception (e.g. 1983, 1984, 1988) is, in part, a response to the\nimplication that perception is so theory-laden that it lacks the\nindependence required to constrain belief (see above for this\nimplication in such diverse thinkers as Kuhn 1962/1970 and Laqueur\n1990). Fodor suggests that sensory perception is modular by which he\nmeans (in part) \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cinformationally\nencapsulated\u201d in its operations\u2014i.e., it operates\nindependently of our will and of our background theories and\nexpectations. Fodor illustrates this effect by pointing to cases of\noptical illusions like the Muller-Lyer illusion (Fodor 1984). Here,\ntwo parallel line segments continue to appear to be different lengths\neven when one knows them be the same length, suggesting the\nindependence of the process that produces sensory phenomena from\none\u2019s background theoretical beliefs. And while some\nphilosophers (e.g. Churchland 1988, cf. Fodor 1988) have resisted this\nconclusion, some social scientists of knowledge have attempted to\nrestate a constructionist view in ways that allow that Fodor may be\ncorrect. Barry Barnes, David Bloor and John Henry, for example, shift\nfrom emphasis on the determination of perceptual experience by culture\nto an emphasis on the underdetermination of belief by perceptual\nexperience (a view which leaves room for cultural determination of\nbelief) (1996, Ch. 1). More generally, epistemologists and\nphilosophers of science have taken up the project of accommodating\nsocial influence in the production of knowledge, and this project is\nwell underway in contemporary social epistemology and philosophy of\nscience (e.g. Boyd 1992; Kitcher 1993, 2001). These issues are taken\nup elsewhere\n (Social Epistemology)\n so we address them no further here. Instead, I focus on attempts by\nnaturalists to accommodate the cultural and personal processes at the\nheart of constructionist phenomena in naturalistic terms.\n\nIn contrast to naturalistic responses to the threat of scientific\nanti-realism, naturalistic responses to constructionist claims about\nrepresentations (including beliefs) understood as human traits have\nbeen far more sympathetic to constructionist approaches. Indeed, an\nemphasis on the cultural and social causes of belief is quite amenable\nto range of naturalists, and naturalistic approaches to these causes\nare well represented in constructionist precursors, including such\nluminaries as Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche (see the section on the\ncritique of the descriptive component of MPS in\n Nietzsche\u2019s Moral and Political Philosophy),\n and Karl Mannheim (1936). In contemporary naturalistic philosophy of\nscience and psychology, the naturalistic explanation of culturally\nproduced cognition is picked up by at least three distinct strands of\nwork taking up constructionist themes of culture. The first is\ncentered on the idea that culture can be understood by analogy with\npopulation genetics, and that cultural items might be understood to be\nmore or less successful based upon their success in spreading in a\npopulation. Various versions of this sentiment find expression in such\ndiverse thinkers as Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson (1985, 2005a,\n2005b), D.T. Campbell (1960), Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Marcus Feldman\n(1981), David Hull (1988), Jesse Prinz (2007, Ch. 6), Daniel Sperber\n(1996), and one version of it has a substantial popular following\n(Richard Dawkins\u2019s (1976) widely read discussion of\n\u201cmemes\u201d). While only some of these thinkers link the\nproject to the understanding of constructionist research themes, the\nproject in every case is to formally model cultural processes,\nunderstanding these complex processes as depending on simpler ones\n(See also\n Cultural Evolution.)\n \n\nThe second, overlapping strand of naturalistic inquiry also views\nculture as a system of representations upon which selection acts, but\nattempts to integrate this idea with the idea, common in evolutionary\ncognitive psychology, that the mind is comprised of a great many\ndomain-specific mental mechanisms, and uses these as the selective\nmechanisms that act as a primary mechanism of selection (so called\n\u201cmassive modularity\u201d; see\n Evolutionary Psychology: Massive Modularity;\n cf. Carruthers 2006), and it is most firmly represented among\ncognitive anthropologists and psychologists like Scott Atran (1998),\nPascal Boyer (1994, 2001), Laurence Hirschfeld (1996), and Daniel\nSperber (1996). Such an approach represents naturalism in most (or\nperhaps all) of the above senses, and it is finding its way into the\nwork of naturalist philosophers of science and psychology (Machery and\nFaucher 2005, Mallon 2013, Nichols 2002, Prinz 2007, Sripada 2006,\nSterelny 2003).\n\nA third, philosophically underdeveloped strand naturalizes crucial\nelements of critical constructionist approaches by suggesting\nthe influence of sometimes implicit evaluations on judgments and\ntheoretical activities. For example, a growing body of empirical\nevidence on so-called \u201cmotivated cognition\u201d (cf. Kunda\n1999) suggests mechanisms for (and some empirical validation of) the\ncritical social constructionist tradition of explaining the content of\naccepted theories in part by appeal to the interests of the theorists.\n\n",
