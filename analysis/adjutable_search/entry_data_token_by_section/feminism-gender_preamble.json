    "main_text": "\n\nFeminism is said to be the movement to end women\u2019s oppression\n(hooks 2000, 26). One possible way to understand \u2018woman\u2019\nin this claim is to take it as a sex term: \u2018woman\u2019 picks\nout human females and being a human female depends on various\nbiological and anatomical features (like genitalia). Historically many\nfeminists have understood \u2018woman\u2019 differently: not as a\nsex term, but as a gender term that depends on social and cultural\nfactors (like social position). In so doing, they distinguished sex\n(being female or male) from gender (being a woman or a man), although\nmost ordinary language users appear to treat the two interchangeably.\nIn feminist philosophy, this distinction has generated a lively\ndebate. Central questions include: What does it mean for gender to be\ndistinct from sex, if anything at all? How should we understand the\nclaim that gender depends on social and/or cultural factors? What does\nit mean to be gendered woman, man, or genderqueer? This entry outlines\nand discusses distinctly feminist debates on sex and gender\nconsidering both historical and more contemporary positions.\n",
