Christianity, for Norris, was a highly personal\nrelationship with one\u2019s God. Being a good Christian involves the\nopening of one\u2019s mind to a comprehension of God. \u201cFor Passion is\nthe great Contrariety to Reason, and will draw a cloud over the\nbrightest Mind. The quiet and sedate Soul is most fit for the\nContemplation of Truth, as the calmest Weather is commonly the most\nserene\u201d (Two Treatises in Treatises upon Several\nSubjects 353).\n\nOne truth the meditative Christian comes to understand is that God is\nlove. Norris believes love is a natural tendency of the soul, and\nanalogizes love to motion in The Theory and Regulation of\nLove. There he writes: \u201cSo that upon the whole to speak\nmore explicitly the most general and Comprehensive Notion of\nLove will be found to be, a motion of the Soul towards\nGod\u201d (12). Regarding the objects of love, one can love the\ngeneral, universal good, viz. God, or particular goods, which reflect\nthe goodness of God, \u201cFor God having unfolded his Perfections in\nthe Creation with almost infinite Variety, and as it were drawn out\nhimself into a numerous issue of Secondary goods, our Love\nbecomes also Multiplied\u201d (12). Regarding the act of love, one\ncan love with benevolence or with desire. Concupiscence, or loving\nwith desire, is a general tendency towards good. Benevolent love is\nwilling a specific good for a person. Benevolent love is further\ndivided into self-love and other-love, which Norris also calls the\n\u201clove of charity.\u201d All concupiscence proceeds from\nindigence so it is rooted in self-love, whereas love of charity does\nnot have to proceed from self-love. He explains why God is a\nnarcissistic God: \u201cFor as GOD is to himself his own good, his\nown Center and Beatifick Object, so the Love of GOD can be no other\nthan Love of himself\u201d (Letters 226). Since God wants\nnothing, God cannot exhibit concupiscence, but only love of charity\nfor humanity. The correct object of our love is also God, especially\ngiven the occasionalism thesis that God is the genuine cause of all\nthe secondary goods we might desire. It is only in God that one finds\nfull satisfaction of desire, \u201che is also the true final Cause of\nthe Will of Man; which I take to be nothing else but that continual\nImpression whereby the Author of Nature moves him towards\nhimself\u201d (227). It is important to keep in mind that God is\ninfinite love; echoing again the Thomistic theme running throughout\nNorris\u2019 works, it is impossible to understand exactly how God\nloves.\n\nContrary to this Thomistic theme, the Socinians believed all Christian\ndoctrine should be comprehensible. Socinianism was advanced in John\nToland\u2019s 1696 Christianity not Mysterious. Socinianism\nrejected inexplicable Christian doctrine, such as the divinity of\nChrist as man. Norris believed Socinianism to be a dangerous view\nbecause it leads to either deism or atheism. This threatening\nentailment led him to respond to the doctrine in An Account of\nReason and Faith, which he published in 1697. In the piece,\nNorris defines some truths as above reason, such as the existence of\nthe Trinity. Other claims are blatantly \u201cContrary to Reason when\nwe do positively comprehend that it cannot be\u201d (117); these\nclaims should be rejected. However, there are many claims we should\nnot reject so quickly:\n\nYou know very well that in the great Problem of the Divisibility of\nQuantity there are Incomprehensibilities on both sides, it being\ninconceivable that Quantity should, and it being also inconceivable\nthat it should not be divided infinitely. And yet you know again that\nas being parts of a Contradiction one of them must necessarily be\ntrue. Possibly you may not be able with the utmost Certainty and\nwithout all hesitation to determine which that is, but however you\nknow in the general that One of them, indeterminately, must be true.\n(322)\n\n\nNeither option presents itself as true, but Norris proceeds to ask the\nSocinian if he would accept it as an article of faith if God were to\nreveal the correct option. Human ignorance does not entail falsity.\nMoreover, human ignorance does not entail divine ignorance just as a\nneophyte mathematician\u2019s inability to demonstrate \u201cthe\nDiameter of a Square is incommensurable to the Side\u201d does\nnot entail the lack of a demonstration (321). Norris concludes that\nthe Socinians improperly hold the human intellect to be the standard\nfor truth. Truth is understood and determined by God, who possesses an\ninfinite intellect. The fact that the Trinity is incomprehensible does\nnot warrant its rejection:\n\nYou have our leave to suppose it as incomprehensible as you please.\nBut then you are to Consider\u2026that this is a Revelation of God\nconcerning Himself, and do you pretend to Comprehend the\nNature and Essence of God? If you do, then your Understanding is as\ninfinite as the Divine. But if you do not, then the\nincomprehensibility of this Mysterious Article ought to be no\nObjection with you against the Belief of it, since if it be, you must\nbe driven to say that you Comprehend the Nature of God, which I hope\nyou have too much Religion as well as Reason to affirm.\n(324\u2013325)\n\n\nReason is reliable, but limited. The Socinians have gone too far in\ntheir support of reason. On the other hand, Norris believes that the\nQuakers have gone too far in the other direction.\n\nNorris was familiar with Roger Barclay and George Keith\u2019s expositions\nof Quakerism, and argued against the view in Reflections upon the\nConduct of Human Life. The Quakers had an affinity for the ideal\nphilosophy because they believed the divine light that enlightens the\nhuman mind supported their view. Norris delineates the many\ndifferences between Quaker thought and his own, but perhaps the main\ndifference is: \u201cThe Quakers represent this light within as a\nsort of Extraordinary Inspiration (whence they have the name\nof Enthusiasts) whereas I suppose it to be a Man\u2019s\nNatural and Ordinary way of Understanding\u201d\n(Two Treatises 365). Also, Norris identifies their\ninspiration as limited to moral and spiritual truths. Norris also\nconcludes that the Quakers render the divine light a creature because\nit cannot be God on the Quakers\u2019 view. God and creatures are the only\ntwo possibilities for existing things, hence, the divine light of the\nQuakers is a creature. Also, the divine light must be considered\nmaterial since it is described as a \u201cVehiculum\nDei\u201d and it is \u201cdivisible into Measures and\nPortions\u201d (437). These attributes cannot be maintained;\ndivisibility and motion cannot \u201cwith any tolerable Congruity\nagree to a Spiritual Substance, strictly so call\u2019d\u201d (438).\nFinally, Norris argues that the Quakers\u2019 divine light is contingent\nbecause it is a creature, so it cannot convey necessary and eternal\ntruths; only an infinite being can be the source of the eternal truths\n(453\u2013454). The proper way to live a good Christian life, morally\nand intellectually, is to engage one\u2019s intellect, \u201cthe greatest\nadvantage of thinking is yet behind, that it improves our Morals as\nwell as our Intellectuals; and serves to make us Better, as well as\nWiser\u201d (Miscellanies 151). The Quakers, by emphasizing\nthe passions, takes the Christian far from the intelligible world.\n\nNorris also believed that the Quakers were guilty of the sin of\nschism. Certain nonconformist Christian groups were exempted from\nprosecution by the Toleration Act of 1689, and the Quakers were\namongst these. Norris firmly believed that schism from the Anglican\nChurch was a sin, and believed the Toleration Act merely removed the\nearthly punishment. In The Charge of Schism Continued, Norris\ncites Ephesians 4.3\u20136, and emphasizes St. Paul\u2019s words\nto the Ephesians to preserve unity. God commands unity, and schism is\na sin where there is an established Church. Norris divides a law into\na preceptive and a punitive element. The basis of the punishment is\nthe rationale of a law, or the preceptive aspect of a law. The\nToleration Act merely removes the punitive aspect, leaving the\nrationale of the law, which is God\u2019s commandment. Furthermore, the\njustification of all human law lies in divine law, \u201cIf it be\nfurther askt, whence has the Law-giver his Authority? I answer, if he\nbe a Creature, he has it from God, whom I suppose to be the sole\nFountain of all Power. But if the Law-giver be God, he has it\nOriginally and Independently in himself\u201d (The Charge\n312). Norris held the Toleration Act to be a violation of divine\nlaw.\n\nOther than his writings on toleration, his sole other published\npolitical work is A Murnival of Knaves issued in 1683 against\nthe Parliamentarians. Norris was a Royalist, but he was not much\nengaged in the volatile politics of his day. A poem in his\nMiscellanies reveals his attitude towards politics:\n\nNO, I shan\u2019t envy him whoe\u2019er he be\n\nThat stand upon the Battlements of State,\n\nStand there who will for me,\n\nI\u2019d rather be secure than great.\n\nOf being so high the pleasure is but small,\n\nBut long the Ruine if I chance to fall. (29)\n\n\nThe ruination of one\u2019s soul for the chance to achieve temporary\ngreatness runs against Norris\u2019 basic convictions, the foremost of\nwhich was a life dedicated to the service of God focused upon the\nafterlife. This dearth of political writings reveals a philosopher who\nengaged in intellectual activity because it reveals an orderly\nuniverse governed by the Christian God. Humility is also an important\nvirtue for the Christian, as Norris explains in A Practical\nTreatise concerning Humility published in 1707. In Creation,\nhumanity has a humble role to play \u2013 to love and serve God.\nPolitical and intellectual endeavors are tools to achieve that end.\nAll human thought and institutions should be utilized to serve God\u2019s\npurposes. This theme is also reflected in Norris\u2019 1705 The\nDistinction between High Church and Low Church, distinctly considered\nand fairly treated.\n",
