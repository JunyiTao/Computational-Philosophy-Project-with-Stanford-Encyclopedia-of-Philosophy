    "main_text": "Critical work on language and philosophy of language || Sex-marking\n1.4 Sex-marking\n\nEnglish, like most\u2014but not all\u2014languages, requires a great\ndeal of what Marilyn Frye calls \u2018sex marking\u2019 (Frye 1983).\nFor example, one cannot use pronouns to refer to a particular\nindividual without knowing their sex. (Frye, in common with most\nfeminists of the early 1980s, does not consider trans issues.  She\nalso does not consider the possibility that pronouns like\n\u2018he\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019 might be a matter of gender,\nnot sex.) Frye notes the absurdity of this.\n\n\nIf I am writing a book review, the use of personal pronouns to refer\nto the author creates the need to know whether that person\u2019s\nreproductive cells are the sort which produce ova or the sort which\nproduce sperm. (Frye 1983: 22)\n\n\nSingular personal pronoun usage, Frye argues, is impossible without\nknowing the sex of the person one is discussing, and in many cases sex\nwould otherwise be utterly irrelevant. Frye takes this to be an\ninstance of a general tendency to make sex relevant where it need not\nbe, which she takes to be a key feature of sexism. In addition, she\nsuggests, the constant need to know and indicate sex helps to\nperpetuate the conviction that sex is a tremendously important matter\nin all areas. For Frye, this is a key factor in perpetuating male\ndominance: male dominance requires the belief that men and women are\nimportantly different from each other, so anything that contributes to\nthe impression that sex differences are important is therefore a\ncontributor to male dominance.\n",
