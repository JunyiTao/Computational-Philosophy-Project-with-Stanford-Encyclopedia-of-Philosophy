    "main_text": "The Anti-Realist Challenges to Metaphysical Realism || Language Acquisition\n3.2 Language Acquisition\n\nThe second challenge to be considered concerns our acquisition of\nlanguage. The challenge to realism is to explain how a child could\ncome to know the meanings of certain sentences within his/her\nlanguage: the ones which the realist contends have undetectable\ntruth-makers associated with them. How could the child learn the\nmeanings of such sentences if these meanings are determined by states\nof affairs not even competent speakers can detect?\n\nConsider the sentence (S) once more:\n\n(S)  Socrates sneezed\nin his sleep the night before he took the hemlock. \n\n\nRealists say (S) is either true or false even though we may (and\nalmost certainly will) never know which it is. The state of affairs\nwhich satisfies (S)\u2019s truth-condition when it is true, its\n\u2018truthmaker\u2019, and the state of affairs which satisfies the\ntruth-condition of the negation of (S) when (S) is false are supposed\nto be able to hold even though competent speakers cannot detect\nwhether they do. How could the child ever learn about this\nundetectable relation?\n\nSuppose God (or nature) had linked our mental representations to just\nthe right states of affairs in the way required by the realist. If so,\nthis is a semantically significant fact. Anyone learning their native\nlanguage would have to grasp these correspondences between sentences\nand states of affairs. How can they do this if even the competent\nspeakers whom they seek to emulate cannot detect when these\ncorrespondences hold? In short, competence in one\u2019s language\nwould be impossible to acquire if realism were true [Dummett 1978,\n1993; Wright 1993]. This is the Language Acquisition challenge.\n\nThis challenge is exacerbated by the anti-realist\u2019s assumption\nthat since the linguistic meaning of an expression \\(E\\) is determined\nsolely by competent speakers\u2019 use of \\(E\\) the child\u2019s\ntask in all cases is to infer the meaning of \\(E\\) from its use. Thus\nDummett [1978 pp. 216\u2013217], in discussing the meaning of\nmathematical statements, proposes a thesis he argues holds for the\nmeanings of every kind of statement:\n\n\nThe meaning of a mathematical statement determines and is exhaustively\ndetermined by its use. The meaning of a mathematical statement cannot\nbe, or contain as an ingredient, anything which is not manifest in the\nuse made of it, lying solely in the mind of the individual who\napprehends that meaning: if two individual agree completely about the\nuse to be made of the statement, then they agree about its meaning.\nThe reason is that the meaning of a statement consists solely in its\nrole as an instrument of communication between individuals, just as\nthe powers of a chess-piece consist solely in its role in the game\naccording to the rules.\n\n\nW.V.O. Quine is even more insistent on the public nature of linguistic\nmeaning. Displaying his unshakable faith in Skinnerian models of\nlanguage-learning he writes [1992, pp. 37\u201338]:\n\nIn psychology one may or may not be a behaviourist, but in linguistics\none has no choice \u2026 There is nothing in linguistic meaning\nbeyond what is to be gleaned from overt behaviour in observable\ncircumstances.\n\n",
