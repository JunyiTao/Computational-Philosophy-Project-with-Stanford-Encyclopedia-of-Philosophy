    "main_text": "Anarchism and Political Activity || Disobedience, Revolution, and Reform\n3.2 Disobedience, Revolution, and Reform\n\nThe question of violence leads us to a further issue: the question of\nobedience, disobedience, resistance, and political obligation. Much\ncould be said here about the nature of political obligation and\nobedience: including whether obedience is merely pragmatic and\nstrategic or based upon notions about loyalty and claims about\nidentification with the nation and its laws. But it is clear that\nanarchists have no principled reason for political obedience. If the\nanarchist views the state as illegitimate, then obedience and\nparticipation are merely a matter of choice, preference, and\npragmatism\u2014and not a matter of loyalty or duty.\n\nChristian anarchists will look, for example, to the case of Jesus and\nhis idea of rendering unto Caesar what is due to Caesar (Matthew\n22:15\u201322). The anarchist interpretation of this passage claims\nthat this is an indication both of Jesus\u2019s disaffection with the\nstate and with his grudging acquiescence to political authority.\nChristoyannopoulos argues, \u201cJesus\u2019 political subversion is\ncarried out through submission rather than revolt\u201d\n(Christoyannopoulos 2010: 156). The crucifixion, on this\ninterpretation, is a subversive event, which \u201cunmasks\u201d\npolitical power as \u201cdemonic\u201d and illegitimate. Jesus does\nnot recognize the ultimate moral and religious authority of Caesar or\nPilate. But he goes along with the political regime. Thus some\nanarchists may simply be compliant and submissive.\n\nBut politically motivated anarchists encourage resistance to state\npower, including strategic and principled disobedience. Such\ndisobedience could involve symbolic actions\u2014graffiti and the\nlike\u2014or acts of civil resistance, protests, tax resistance and\nso on\u2014up to, and possibly including, sabotage, property crime,\nand outright violence. Again, there is overlap with the discussion of\nviolence here, but let\u2019s set that question aside and focus on\nthe notion of civil disobedience.\n\nOne important example is found in Thoreau, who famously explained his\nact of disobedience by tax resistance as follows:\n\n\nIn fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after my fashion,\nthough I will still make what use and get what advantage of her I can,\nas is usual in such cases. (Thoreau 1849 [1937: 687])\n\n\nThoreau\u2019s disobedience is principled. He recognizes that a\ndeclaration of war against the state is a criminal act. He willingly\ngoes to jail. But he also admits that he will cooperate with the state\nin other cases\u2014since there is something advantageous about\ncooperation. This indicates the complexity of the question of\ncooperation, protest, and disobedience. Thoreau\u2019s essay,\n\u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d (1849), is often viewed as an\nanarchist manifesto. Kropotkin discussed him as an anarchist\n(Kropotkin 1927 [2002]). And Tolstoy admired his act of civil\ndisobedience\u2014as did Gandhi.\n\nAnarchists continue to discuss strategies and tactics of disobedience.\nOne problem throughout this discussion is the degree to which\ndisobedience is effective. If there were to be successful anarchist\ncampaigns of disobedience they would have to be organized and\nwidespread. Whether such campaigns would actually work to disassemble\nthe state apparatus remains an open question.\n\nUntil their dreamed-of revolution comes, anarchist must consider the\ndegree to which cooperation with the state involves \u201cselling\nout\u201d to the political status quo. Perhaps there are reforms and\nshort-term gains that can be obtained through traditional political\nmeans: voting, lobbying legislators, etc. But anarchists have often\nheld to an all-or-nothing kind of approach to political participation.\nWe noted above that the Christian anarchist Jacques Ellul has said\nthat he does not vote because anarchy implies conscientious objection.\nBut herein lies a strategic conundrum. If progressively minded\nanarchists opt out of the political system, this means that less\nenlightened policies will prevail. By not voting or otherwise engaging\nin ordinary politics, the anarchist ends up with a system that he or\nshe will be even less happy with than if he or she had actively\nparticipated in the system.\n\nThis is, really, a problem of revolution versus reform. The\nrevolutionary wants revolution now, believing that it will occur by\nway of direct action of various sorts. Perhaps the revolutionary is\nalso thinking that the psychological, cultural, and spiritual\nevolution toward revolutionary consciousness can only occur when\ndirect action is taken: in order for anarchism to emerge, the\nanarchist may think, one ought to behave and think like an anarchist.\nBut without a concerted and nation-wide revolution, revolutionary\naction begins to look like mere selfishness, Epicurean opting out, or\nwhat Bookchin criticized as \u201clifestyle anarchism\u201d.\nMeanwhile those reform-minded folks who work within the system of\npolitical power and legality can end up supporting a system that they\nhave doubts about. This philosophical problem of reform vs. revolution\nexists for all radical political agendas. But the problem is\nespecially acute for anarchists, since anarchism is often an\nall-or-none proposition: if the state is justified then gradualism and\nreformism make sense; but if no state can be justified, then what is\nsometimes called \u201creformist anarchism\u201d is a non-starter\n(see L. Davis 2012).\n3.3. Utopian Communities and Non-Revolutionary Anarchism\n\nMany anarchists are revolutionaries who want change to be created\nthrough direct action. But given our preceding discussion of violence,\ndisobedience, and the potential for success of revolutionary activity,\nthe question arises about opting-out of political life. The Epicureans\nand Cynics pointed in this direction. The history of anarchism is\nreplete with efforts to construct anarchist communes that are\nindependent and separated from the rest of state centered political\nlife.\n\nWe might pick up the history here with the Christian anarchists and\npacifists of the Reformation: the Mennonites, for example; or the\nQuakers who refused to doff their hats for political authorities and\nwho sought a refuge in Pennsylvania. Indeed, there is an anarchist\nthread to the colonization of North America, as those who were\ndisgruntled with European political and religious hierarchy left for\nthe \u201cnew world\u201d or were forced out by the European\nauthorities. In the Seventeenth Century, Anne Hutchinson was cast out\nof the Massachusetts Bay Colony and forced to found a new community,\nwhen she concluded that the idea of government was flawed. Hutchinson\nis considered as one of the first anarchists of North America (see\nStringham 2007). Separatist communities were founded by the New\nEngland abolitionists and transcendentalists, by Josiah Warren, and by\nothers.\n\nAnarchist communes were formed in Europe during the Nineteenth Century\nand in Spain during the 1930s. There have been ongoing movements and\norganizations of indigenous peoples and others who inhabit the margins\nof mainstream political life. In the 1960s and 70s, anarchist\nseparatism was reiterated in the Hippy communes and attempts to live\noff the grid and get back to nature. Alternative communes, squats, and\nspontaneous gatherings continue to occur.\n\nSeparatist communities have to consider: the degree to which they give\nup on anarchist direct action against dominant political forces, the\nextent to which they have to accommodate themselves to political\nreality, and the risk that customary hierarchies will be reinstated\nwithin the commune. For the revolutionary anarchist, separatism is a\nstrategy of avoidance that impedes political action. Separatist\ncommunes must often obey the rules of the dominant political\norganization in order to trade and get connected to the rest of the\nworld. Finally, a complaint made about separatist communes is that\nthey can end up being structured by sexist, classist, and other\nhierarchical organizing principles. One might argue that until the\ndominant culture is revolutionized, separatism will only be a pale\nreflection of the anarchist ideal. And yet, on the other hand,\nadvocates of separatism will argue that the best way for anarchist\nideals to take hold is to demonstrate that they work and to provide an\ninspiration and experimental proving ground for anarchism.\n\nIf revolutionary activity is taken off the table, then anarchists are\nleft with various forms of gradualism and reformism. One way this\nmight occur is through the creation of \u201ctemporary autonomous\nzones\u201d such as those described by Bey. Along these lines David\nGraeber provides a description of the cultural and spiritual work that\nwould be required in order to prepare the way for anarchist\nrevolution. Graeber says that this would require \u201cliberation in\nthe imaginary\u201d, by which he means that through activism, utopian\ncommunities, and the like there can be a gradual change in the way\npolitical power is imagined and understood (Graeber 2004).\nRevolutionary anarchists will respond to this by arguing that\nliberation in the imaginary is simply imaginary liberation: without\nactual change in the status quo, oppression and inequality continue to\nbe a problem.\n4. Objections and Replies\n\nLet\u2019s conclude by considering some standard objections to\nanarchism and typical replies.\n4.1 Anarchism is Nihilistic and Destructive\n\nObjection: This objection holds that anarchism is\nmerely another name for chaos and for a rejection of order. This\nobjection holds that anarchists are violent and destructive and that\nthey are intent on destroying everything, including morality\nitself.\n\nReply: This objection does not seem to recognize that\nanarchists come in many varieties. Many anarchists are also\npacifists\u2014and so do not advocate violent revolution. Many other\nanarchists are firmly committed to moral principles such as autonomy,\nliberty, solidarity, and equality. Some anarchists do take their\ncritique of arch\u00e9 in a nihilistic direction that\ndenies ethical principles. But one can be committed to anarchism,\nwhile advocating for caring communities. Indeed, many of the main\nauthors in the anarchist tradition believed that the state and the\nother hierarchical and authoritarian structures of contemporary\nsociety prevented human flourishing.\n4.2 Anarchy Will Always Evolve Back into the State\n\nObjection: This objection holds that anarchism is\ninherently unstable. Hobbes and other early modern social contract\ntheories maintain that the state emerges as a necessary response to\nnatural anarchy which keeps order and protects our interests. A\ndifferent theory comes from Nozick, who argues that the\n\u201cnight-watchman state\u201d would emerge out of anarchy by an\ninvisible hand process: as people will exercise their liberty and\npurchase protection from a protection agency, which would eventually\nevolve into something like a minimal state.\n\nReply: Anarchists may argue that the state of nature\nis simply not a state of war and so that Hobbes\u2019s description is\nfalse. Some anarcho-primitivists will argue that things were much\nbetter for human beings in the original state of nature in small\ncommunities living close to the land. Other anarchists might argue\nthat the disadvantages of state organizations\u2014the creation of\nhierarchies, monopolies, inequalities, and the like\u2014simply\noutweigh the benefits of state structures; and that rational agents\nwould choose to remain in anarchy rather than allow the state to\nevolve. Some anarchists may argue that each time a state emerges, it\nwould have to be destroyed. But others will argue that education and\nhuman development (including technological development) would prevent\nthe reemergence of the state.\n4.3 Anarchism is Utopian\n\nObjection: This objection holds that there simply is\nno way to destroy or deconstruct the state. So exercises in anarchist\npolitical theory are fruitless. It would be better, from this point of\nview to focus on critiques of hierarchy, inequality, and threats to\nliberty from within liberal or libertarian political theory\u2014and\nto engage in reforms that occur within the status quo and mainstream\npolitical organization.\n\nReply: Ideal theory is always in opposition to\nnon-ideal theory. But utopian speculation can be useful for clarifying\nvalues. Thus philosophical anarchism may be a useful exercise that\nhelps us understand our values and commitment, even though political\nanarchism has no hope of succeeding. Furthermore, there are examples\nof successful anarchist communities on a small local scale (for\nexample, in the separatist communities discussed above). These\nconcrete examples can be viewed as experiments in anarchist theory and\npractice.\n4.4 Anarchism is Incoherent\n\nObjection: This objection holds that a political\ntheory that abolishes political structures makes no sense. A related\nconcern arises when anarchism is taken to be a critique of authority\nin every case and in all senses. If anarchists deny then that there\ncan be any arch\u00e9 whatsoever, then the claim\ncontradicts itself: we would have a ruling theory that states that\nthere is no ruling theory. This sort of criticism is related to\nstandard criticisms of relativism and nihilism. Related to this is a\nmore concrete and mundane objection that holds that there can be no\nanarchist movement or collective action, since anarchism is\nconstitutionally opposed to the idea of a movement or collective\n(since under anarchism there can be no authoritative ruler or set of\nrules).\n\nReply: This objection only holds if anarchism is\ntaken to be an all-or-nothing theory of the absolutist variety.\nPolitical anarchists do not necessarily agree with the skeptical\npost-foundationalist critique which holds that there can be no ruling\nprinciple or authority whatsoever. Rather, political anarchists hold\nthat there are legitimate authorities but that political power quickly\nloses its authoritativeness and legitimacy. Furthermore, anarchists\ntend to advocate for a principle and procedure for organization based\nupon voluntarism and mutual aid, as well as unanimity and/or\nconsensus. From this point of view anarchist communities can work very\nwell, provided that they avoid coercive authority. To support this\npoint anarchists will point to historical examples of successful\nanarchist communes. They will also point to ordinary human\nrelations\u2014in families and civil society relationship\u2014which\noperate quite well apart form coercive and hierarchical political\nauthority\n4.5 Philosophical Anarchism is \u201cToothless\u201d\n\nObjection: One objection to philosophical anarchism\nof the sort discussed throughout this essay is that it remains merely\ntheoretical. Some political anarchists have little patience for\nabstract discourses that do not engage in direct action. One worry\nabout philosophical anarchism is that in failing to act\u2014and in\nfailing to take responsibility for the actions that ought to follow\nfrom thought\u2014philosophical anarchism remains a bourgeois\nconvenience that actually serves the status quo. Thus when\nphilosophical anarchists remain uncommitted in terms of the concrete\nquestions raised by anarchism\u2014whether they should obey the law,\nwhether they should vote, and so on\u2014they tend to support the\ninterests of defenders of the status quo.\n\nReply: In response to this objection, one might\ndefend the importance of philosophical reflection. It is important to\nbe clear about principles and ideas before taking action. And with\nanarchism the stakes are quite high. The puzzles created by\nphilosophical anarchism are profound. They lead us to question\ntraditional notions of sovereignty, political obligation, and so on.\nThey lead us to wonder about cultural and ethical conventions,\nincluding also our first principles regarding the theory and\norganization of social life. Given the difficulty of resolving many of\nthese questions, the philosophical anarchist may hold that caution is\nin order. Moreover, the philosophical anarchist might also defend the\nimportance of wonder. The anarchist critique gives us reason to wonder\nabout much that we take for granted. Wonder may not change the world\nin immediate ways or lead to direct action. But wonder is an important\nstep in the direction of thoughtful, ethical action.",
