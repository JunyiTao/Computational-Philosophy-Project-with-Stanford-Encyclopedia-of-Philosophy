    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nWe do not know much about Protagoras\u2019 life, and even less about\nhis death: as the most famous sophist, he became the object of many,\noften unreliable, anecdotes. He was born in Abdera in Thrace, in the\nnorth coast of the Aegean Sea. In Plato\u2019s Protagoras\n(317c) he says that he is old enough to be the father of anyone\npresent, including Hippias and Prodicus. This confirms that he was one\nof the earliest sophists and suggests the 490s BCE as his birth year.\nAccording to an anecdote in Diogenes Laertius (IX.53) he was a porter\nuntil Democritus taught him. Democritus was also from Abdera, but was\nyounger by about thirty years and criticised Protagoras\u2019 thesis\nof the \u201cMan measure\u201d (see below) on the charge of being\nself-refuting. It is therefore highly improbable that Protagoras was\none of his pupils. The anecdote, probably derived from some comic\npoets (such as Eupolis or Hermippus) due to possible connections\nbetween their epistemological theories, also served to point to\nProtagoras\u2019 humble origins; an alternative testimony from\nPhilostratus (Lives of the Sophist I.10.1\u20132) about his\nfamily hosting Xerxes at the time of the Persian wars goes in the\nopposite direction. This testimony also reports that Xerxes granted\nProtagoras\u2019 family the rare privilege of having their son\nProtagoras educated by the Magi (this anecdote was also used to\nexplain his agnosticism, as if it was impossible for a Greek to\nendorse similar ideas, see below). Even if we regard this story as\nspurious, it still seems to confirm the contacts between Protagoras\nand the culture of the Ionian colonies and of the Near East. As Plato\nrepeatedly reports, he later travelled around Greece as a teacher and\na \u201csophist\u201d (most importantly, again according to Plato,\nhe was the first to explicitly present himself as such,\nProtagoras 316c\u2013317b), earning great fame and amassing\nconsiderable riches. It is equally certain that Protagoras sojourned\nat least twice in Athens in Pericles\u2019 time, establishing with\nhim personal ties. It is more difficult to tell whether these contacts\nalso led to a direct involvement in the democratic politics of the\ngreat statesman. Evidence in this direction is apparently provided not\njust by some of the sophist\u2019s surviving fragments, but also by\nthe fact that in 444 BCE, Pericles entrusted him with drafting the\nconstitution of the new pan-Hellenic colony of Thurii in South Italy\n(clearly, an appointment of this sort implies that the two men shared\nthe same political outlook). This connection with Pericles can also be\nconfirmed by the upheavals that marked the last years of\nProtagoras\u2019 life: the crisis of Periclean politics seems to find\na counterpart in the downfall of Protagoras, who\u2014like other\npersonalities close to the statesman\u2014was put on trial. By the\nsame account, the sophist died in a shipwreck during his flight.\nHowever, this is very questionable. First, that he had a trial seems\nto be confirmed also by other sources; but these sources (in\nparticular Aristotle, see Diogenes Laertius IX.54) do not seem to\nrelate the trial to political issues (Diogenes actually relates the\ntrial to the charge of impiety, which would justify the story about\nthe shipwreck as divine punishment); at stake was rather a controversy\nwith a pupil. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that the trial with the\nstudent was also a fiction. Second, the story of the trial and flight\nfrom Athens differs from what Plato writes in his dialogues, where he\nspeaks of Protagoras as though he had died as a universally esteemed\nfigure in old age. From Plato we know that Protagoras lived\napproximately 70 years (Meno 91e; other sources state 90\nyears), which would place his death at around 420 BCE. Protagoras'\npupils include Antimoerus of Mende, Carmidas and Euathlus of Athens,\nand Theodore of Cyrene. Protagoras\u2019 influence has also been\nposited in relation to Prodicus and the Dissoi Logoi,\nalthough it is difficult to measure its extent.\n",
