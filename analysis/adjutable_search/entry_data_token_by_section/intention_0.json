Intending as Doing\n\nIn \u2018Actions, Reasons and Causes,\u2019 Donald Davidson gave a\nreductive theory of \u2018intention with which\u2019 as\n\u2018syncategorematic\u2019: the phrase does not refer to an event\nor state of the agent, but is a way of redescribing what she is doing\nin terms of a \u2018primary reason,\u2019 where this is understood\nas a pro-attitude towards actions having some feature, F,\nalong with the belief that the original action has that feature\n(Davidson 1963, pp. 5\u20138). It is in virtue of its relation to a\nprimary reason that the action counts as intentional, and this reason\ngives the intention with which the action is done. Davidson thereby\nunified, or took himself to have unified, intentional action and\nintention-with-which.\n\nAs he came to see, however, this story neglects and cannot easily\nincorporate prospective intention or intention for the future\n(Davidson 1978). There are apparent cases of \u2018pure\nintending\u2019 in which no steps of any kind are taken. Suppose that\nI intend to write a book review but have yet to open the book. On the\nface of it, such pure intending cannot be reduced to intentional\naction. What is more, once we recognize the existence of pure\nintending, \u2018there is no reason not to allow that intention of\nexactly the same kind is also present when the intended action\neventuates\u2019 (Davidson 1978, p. 89). If what I am doing\nintentionally takes time, as almost everything does, there will be\nearly phases in which I stand to the completion of the deed as I stand\nto future actions I intend to perform but have yet to begin.\n\nThe majority of work since Davidson\u2019s conversion has followed\nhim in acknowledging the state of prospective intention as irreducible\nto action, and has been led to seek unity in the forms of intention by\nexplaining the others\u2014intentional action and\nintention-with-which\u2014in terms of intending as a mental state.\nRecently, however, philosophers inspired by Anscombe\u2019s\nIntention have offered resistance to this move. Anscombe\ndenies that there is a sharp distinction between \u2018I am doing\nA\u2019 and \u2018I am going to do A\u2019\noffered as answers to the question \u2018Why are you doing\nB?\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, pp. 39\u201340). Nor does she\nregard intention for the future as needing further explanation once\nintentional action and intention-with-which have been understood\n(Anscombe 1963, pp. 90\u20134). Thus, Anscombe appears to solve the\nproblem of unity without acknowledging intention as a mental\nstate.\n\nThe simplest version of this approach would emphasize the\n\u2018openness\u2019 of the progressive, that \u2018He is doing\nA\u2019 does not imply that he will succeed in doing\nA, or that he has or will get very far with it. (That I am\ncrossing the road is consistent with being hit by a car the moment I\nstep off the curb.) It then identifies the fact that S\nintends to do A with the fact that S is doing\nA intentionally, though perhaps he has barely begun. If I\nintend to visit the zoo next Thursday, I am already on the way to\ndoing so. Here it is striking that we sometimes employ the present\nprogressive in anticipation: \u2018Kieran is visiting the zoo next\nThursday\u2019 sounds perfectly fine when said today, before I have\ntaken any overt steps (see Falvey 2000 pp. 25\u20136; Thompson 2008,\npp. 140\u20131; Moran and Stone 2009, pp. 145\u20136).\n\nA more subtle line would concede that we do not always use the\nprogressive quite so liberally, but insist that doing so carves nature\nat its joints. According to Michael Thompson (2008, pp. 91\u20132,\n133\u201346), intending to do A is not a mental state\nbecause it is not static; instead it is a form of imperfectivity or\nbeing in progress towards the intentional completion of an act, where\nthe progress may be so vestigial or ineffectual or interrupted that it\nwould be odd to remark, \u2018He is doing A.\u2019 (See\nThompson 2008, pp. 91\u20132, 133\u201345; Moran and Stone 2009, pp.\n146\u20138; Ferrero 2017; Russell 2018.) The unity of prospective\nintention and \u2018doing A intentionally\u2019 is that the\nlatter, too, consists of being in progress, though perhaps with the\nimplication of some success.\n\nAlong with this unity, and the hint supplied by the use of the\nprogressive in anticipation, there are two main arguments for the\ntheory of intending as being embarked on intentional action. First, it\nreadily explains why intending is always intending to do\nsomething. (For this argument, see Thompson 2008, pp. 120\u20133,\n127\u20138, 130\u20131, drawing on Baier 1970; Moran and Stone 2009,\npp. 143, 147.) Although we sometimes report intention as a\npropositional attitude\u2014\u2018I intend that\np\u2019\u2014such reports can be recast as \u2018intending\nto\u2026\u2019 as when I intend to bring about that p. By\ncontrast, it is difficult to rephrase such mundane expressions as\n\u2018I intend to go home\u2019 in propositional terms. \u2018I\nintend that I am (will be) going home\u2019 suggests indifference to\ngetting there. \u2018I intend that I (will) have got home\u2019\nsuggests indifference to my own agency. \u2018I intend that I go\nhome\u2019 can only be read as an intention with a habitual object,\ndescribing a general practice of going home; it is not directed at a\nparticular action. If intending is being on the way to intentional\naction, it is no surprise that its proper object\u2014what one is on\nthe way to doing\u2014is not a proposition or state of affairs, but\nsomething one might do.\n\nSecond, the theory of intending as being embarked on intentional\naction explains the unity of what Thompson calls\n\u2018na\u00efve\u2019 and \u2018sophisticated\u2019\nrationalization. (For this argument, see Thompson 2008, pp.\n97\u20139, 118\u20139, 132\u20134.) As well as explaining action by\nintention\u2014\u2018He is doing A because he intends to do\nB\u2019\u2014we explain action by action\u2014\u2018He is\ndoing A because he is doing B\u2019\u2014intention\nby intention\u2014\u2018He intends to do A because he\nintends to do B\u2019\u2014and intention by\naction\u2014\u2018He intends to do A because he is doing\nB.\u2019 On the face of it, moreover,\n\u2018na\u00efve\u2019 explanations in terms of what someone is\ndoing entail \u2018sophisticated\u2019 explanations that appeal to\nintention. At least when we are using the \u2018because\u2019 of\nrationalization, \u2018He is doing A because he is doing\nB\u2019 arguably entails \u2018He is doing A\nbecause he intends to do B.\u2019 The same point holds for\nwhat is explained: \u2018He is doing A\nbecause\u2026\u2019 entails \u2018He intends to do A\nbecause\u2026\u2019 If intending is being on the way to intentional\naction, these are all forms of explanation by, and of, such progress.\nSo, again, it is no surprise that they are bound together in just the\nway that they appear to be.\n\nIf we help ourselves to the \u2018because\u2019 of rationalization,\nwe can further exploit the unity of its \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 and\n\u2018sophisticated\u2019 forms to give a simple theory of\nintention-with-which. An intention with which one is doing A\nis an intentional-action-in-progress that explains one\u2019s doing\nit. We thus complete the task of unification that was set by the\nthreefold division of intention for the future, intention-with-which,\nand intentional action, all of which are modes of, or modes of\nexplanation by, being embarked on intentional action.\n\nA final virtue of this account is that it captures the element of\ncommitment in intention, emphasized by Michael Bratman, among others\n(Bratman 1987, pp. 18\u201320). Intention is not merely predominant\ndesire. When I decide to do something, and so intend to do it, I am\nembarked upon doing it. This vindicates the Aristotelian view that\naction itself is the conclusion of practical thought.\n\nBecause of its relatively recent recovery, and the prevalent\nacceptance of intention as a mental state, there has been little\nexamination of the present alternative. But some observations can be\nmade. First, it is in fact controversial that intending to do\nA is necessary for doing A intentionally, as the\npresent theory predicts. This raises complications best considered\nlater on, in sections 2 and 4. (They are briefly discussed at Thompson\n2008, pp. 102\u20133.)\n\nSecond, and more obviously, there is room to doubt whether intending\nto do A is sufficient for me to count as doing it\nintentionally, even when we admit that I can be doing what I will\nnever successfully do. Isn\u2019t there a distinction between taking\npreparatory steps towards doing A and beginning to do it, as\nin the contrast between buying flour and eggs with the intention of\nbaking, and turning on the oven the following week? This distinction\nmay be significant in ethics and the criminal law (Paul 2014a). There\nis also the prospect of plans that require no preparatory steps, as\nfor instance, to blink tomorrow at 3:00pm. Isn\u2019t some intending\nutterly pure, as Davidson thought? Once we move away from the simple\ntheory of intending as doing, however, and introduce the abstract\nnotion of imperfectivity or being in progress, it is more difficult to\nsay what such examples show. That the theory is false? Or just how\nliminal being in progress can be?\n\nMore telling, perhaps, is the possibility of making a mistake, as when\nI intend to walk home by the shortest possible route, but have taken a\nwrong turn. Do I count as being embarked on walking home by the\nshortest route? If not, the theory stands refuted. If so, I can be on\nthe way not only to doing something I will never do because I will be\ninterrupted, but something it is now impossible for me to do. Can we\nexplain how my doings are directed at that impossible outcome except\nby appeal to the intention with which they are performed?\n\nThe arguments that motivate the theory of intending as being embarked\non intentional action are in any case inconclusive. As to the second,\nwhile it is a constraint on any theory of intention to show the unity\nof \u2018na\u00efve\u2019 and \u2018sophisticated\u2019\nrationalization, insofar as they are really unified, it would take\nmuch further argument to show that this cannot be done while thinking\nof intention as a mental state (cf. Setiya 2007a, pp. 51\u20132).\nFurther demands for unity push towards that view. So, for instance, if\nwe hope to bring out what is common to the explanations \u2018He is\ndoing A because he is doing B\u2019 and \u2018He\nis doing A because p\u2019 where these entail,\nrespectively, \u2018He is doing A because he intends to do\nB\u2019 and \u2018He is doing A because he\nbelieves that p,\u2019 we will have to relate intention to\nthe mental state of belief. If intention is not itself a mental state,\nbut a way of being in progress, such relations are more puzzling. They\nare taken up again in section 5.\n\nAs to the first, those who think of intention as a mental state could\nexplain why its objects are restricted to actions by saying more about\nthe kind of state it is. For instance, if intention is a\nrepresentation that is such as to guide and control what it\nrepresents, its object must be as such as to be guided: it must be the\nsort of thing that can be in progress and move towards completion,\nsomething that can be done, not a mere proposition or state of\naffairs. Alternatively, the restriction could be denied (as it is by\nDavis 1984, pp. 131\u20132; Ferrero 2013). Intending that p\nis fundamental, and intending to go home can be explained in terms of\nit: I intend that I will get home by going home.\n\nFinally, whatever view we take about the basic objects of\nintention\u2014actions or propositions\u2014it is a problem for the\ntheory of intending as being embarked on intentional action that these\nobjects can be logically complex. I intend not to be hit by a car as I\nwalk home. I intend to drink with dinner or have dessert, but not\nboth. I intend to read a book tonight if there\u2019s nothing on the\nradio. In none of these cases can we say, without contrivance, what\naction I am now on the way to performing. Until it is supplied with an\naccount of these cases, and of the relation between intention and the\nmental states with which it interacts, the theory of intending as\nbeing embarked on intentional action remains incomplete.\n",
