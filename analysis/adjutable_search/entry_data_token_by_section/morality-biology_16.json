    "main_text": "Evolutionary Metaethics || Selective Evolutionary Debunking Arguments\n4.3 Evolutionary Biology and Expressivism\n\nA less ambitious claim made by some antirealists is that the account\nin section 2.3 of the origins of our capacity for normative guidance\nat least lends support to or fits naturally with an\nexpressivist metaethical view\u2014the view that moral\njudgments do not even purport to state moral facts, but instead\nexpress non-cognitive states such as attitudes or acceptance of\ncertain norms, etc. (Gibbard 1990; Kitcher 2006a). Suppose the human\ncapacity for normative guidance is indeed an adaptation that evolved\nin connection with social coordination, cooperation and stability.\nThis capacity involves being in the state of accepting a\nnorm, which we should thus expect to be a standard part of human\nmoral psychology and its capacity for \u201clinguistically infused\nmotivation\u201d (Gibbard 1990, 55). This may lend support to a\nnorm-expressivist approach to normative judgment, insofar as such an\napproach focuses precisely on the notion of accepting a norm, and the\nevolutionary story provides good reason to suppose that accepting a\nnorm is a \u201cnatural, biological phenomenon\u201d (61).\n\nIt is less clear, however, whether anything stronger than this can be\nsaid. Suppose it\u2019s true that we evolved a capacity and tendency\nfor normative guidance because of the coordinating social function\nachieved by the expression of norm acceptance. Not only does this\nleave open what we now use that capacity to do, but it even\nleaves open what exactly our ancestors did with it. One possibility is\nthat the activity they were engaged with was non-cognitive:\nthey were merely expressing non-cognitive states comprising attitudes\nand states of norm acceptance. Kitcher (2006a) suggests that this is\nthe metaethical picture best supported by the evolutionary story. But\nJoyce (2006, 175\u201376) has disputed this. Even granting that the\nbiological function of moral judgment is social coordination,\nthe linguistic function of moral judgments could go either\nway: it may be that the biological function was carried out through\nnon-cognitive expressions of norm acceptance, but it may equally\ninstead be that it was carried out through cognitive\njudgments involving claims to objective validity. Indeed, the\nsocial function might be all the better served if those making moral\njudgments firmly believe in objective values and assert those beliefs,\neven if they are in fact making a projective error in doing so, as\nerror theorists claim. Compare: even if religious belief has a\nbiological function (e.g., reducing anxiety), it wouldn\u2019t follow\nthat religious assertions are non-cognitive and so aren\u2019t really\nassertions, and the story might be more plausible if it is assumed\nthat they are genuine assertions (Joyce 2006, 176, 208; Ruse\n2006).\n\nThus, although the evolutionary story fits naturally with a merely\nnon-cognitivist metaethical view, it may fit equally well with a\ncognitivist view. If one rejects the existence of moral truths, the\nlatter would then lead to an error theory (Mackie 1977). But as\ndiscussed in section 4.1, it is far from clear how much support\nevolutionary biology itself lends to moral anti-realism or irrealism.\nIt is consistent with plausible evolutionary stories that although our\ncapacities for normative guidance originally evolved for reasons that\nhad nothing to do with moral truths as such, we now regularly employ\nthem to deliberate about and to communicate moral truths. So all three\nmetaethical views discussed here\u2014expressivism, error theory and\nmoral realism\u2014remain on the table.\n",
