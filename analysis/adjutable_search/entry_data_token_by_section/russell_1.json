Russell\u2019s Work in Logic\n\nRussell\u2019s main contributions to logic and the foundations of\nmathematics include his discovery of\n Russell\u2019s paradox,\n also known as the Russell-Zermelo paradox (Linsky 2013), his development (together with Whitehead) of the\n theory of types,\n his championing of logicism (the view that mathematics is, in some\nsignificant sense, reducible to formal logic), his impressively\ngeneral theory of logical relations, his formalization of the\nmathematics of quantity and of the real numbers, and his refining of\nthe first-order predicate calculus. \n\nRussell discovered the paradox that bears his name in 1901, while\nworking on his Principles of Mathematics (1903). The paradox\narises in connection with the set of all sets that are not members of\nthemselves. Such a set, if it exists, will be a member of itself if\nand only if it is not a member of itself. In his 1901 draft of the\nPrinciples of Mathematics, Russell summarizes the problem as\nfollows:\n\nThe axiom that all referents with respect to a given relation form a\nclass seems, however, to require some limitation, and that for the\nfollowing reason. We saw that some predicates can be predicated of\nthemselves. Consider now those \u2026 of which this is not the case.\n\u2026 [T]here is no predicate which attaches to all of them and to\nno other terms. For this predicate will either be predicable or not\npredicable of itself. If it is predicable of itself, it is one of\nthose referents by relation to which it was defined, and therefore, in\nvirtue of their definition, it is not predicable of itself.\nConversely, if it is not predicable of itself, then again it is one of\nthe said referents, of all of which (by hypothesis) it is predicable,\nand therefore again it is predicable of itself. This is a\ncontradiction. (CP, Vol. 3, 195)\n\n\nThe paradox is significant since, using classical logic, all sentences\nare entailed by a contradiction. Russell\u2019s discovery thus\nprompted a large amount of work in logic, set theory, and the\n philosophy and foundations of mathematics.\n\nRussell\u2019s response to the\n paradox\n came between 1903 and 1908 with the development of his\n theory of types.\n It was clear to Russell that some form of restriction needed to be\nplaced on the original comprehension (or abstraction) axiom of\nna\u00efve set theory, the axiom that formalizes the intuition that\nany coherent condition (or property) may be used to determine a set.\nRussell\u2019s basic idea was that reference to sets such as the\nso-called Russell set (the set of all sets that are not members of\nthemselves) could be avoided by arranging all sentences into a\nhierarchy, beginning with sentences about individuals at the lowest\nlevel, sentences about sets of individuals at the next lowest level,\nsentences about sets of sets of individuals at the next lowest level,\nand so on. Using a vicious circle principle similar to that adopted by\nthe mathematician Henri Poincar\u00e9, together with his so-called\n\u201cno class\u201d theory of classes (in which class terms gain\nmeaning only when placed in the appropriate context), Russell was able\nto explain why the unrestricted comprehension axiom fails:\n propositional functions,\n such as the function \u201cx is a set,\u201d may not be\napplied to themselves since self-application would involve a vicious\ncircle. As a result, all objects for which a given condition (or\npredicate) holds must be at the same level or of the same\n\u201ctype.\u201d Sentences about these objects will then always be\nhigher in the hierarchy than the objects themselves.\n\nAlthough first introduced in 1903, the theory of types was further\ndeveloped by Russell in his 1908 article \u201cMathematical Logic as\nBased on the Theory of Types\u201d and in the three-volume work he\nco-authored with\n Alfred North Whitehead,\n Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913). The theory thus admits of two\nversions, the \u201csimple theory\u201d of 1903 and the\n\u201cramified theory\u201d of 1908. Both versions of the theory\ncame under attack: the simple theory for being too weak, the ramified\ntheory for being too strong. For some, it was important that any\nproposed solution be comprehensive enough to resolve all known\nparadoxes at once. For others, it was important that any proposed\nsolution not disallow those parts of classical mathematics that\nremained consistent, even though they appeared to violate the vicious\ncircle principle. (For discussion of related paradoxes, see Chapter 2\nof the Introduction to Whitehead and Russell (1910), as well as the\nentry on\n paradoxes and contemporary logic\n in this encyclopedia.)\n\nRussell himself had recognized several of these same concerns as early\nas 1903, noting that it was unlikely that any single solution would\nresolve all the known paradoxes. Together with Whitehead, he was also\nable to introduce a new axiom, the axiom of reducibility, which\nlessened the vicious circle principle\u2019s scope of application and\nso resolved many of the most worrisome aspects of type theory. Even\nso, critics claimed that the axiom was simply too ad hoc to be\njustified philosophically. (For additional discussion see Linsky\n(1990), Linsky (2002) and Wahl (2011).)\n\nOf equal significance during this period was Russell\u2019s defense\nof logicism, the theory that mathematics is in some important sense\nreducible to logic. First defended in his 1901 article \u201cRecent\nWork on the Principles of Mathematics,\u201d and later in greater\ndetail in his Principles of Mathematics and in Principia\nMathematica, Russell\u2019s logicism consisted of two main\ntheses. The first was that all mathematical truths can be translated\ninto logical truths or, in other words, that the vocabulary of\nmathematics constitutes a proper subset of the vocabulary of logic.\nThe second was that all mathematical proofs can be recast as logical\nproofs or, in other words, that the theorems of mathematics constitute\na proper subset of the theorems of logic. As Russell summarizes,\n\u201cThe fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic Logic is one of the\ngreatest discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been\nestablished, the remainder of the principles of mathematics consists\nin the analysis of Symbolic Logic itself\u201d (1903, 5).\n\nLike\n Gottlob Frege,\n Russell\u2019s basic idea for defending logicism was that numbers\nmay be identified with classes of classes and that number-theoretic\nstatements may be explained in terms of quantifiers and identity. Thus\nthe number 1 is to be identified with the class of all unit classes,\nthe number 2 with the class of all two-membered classes, and so on.\nStatements such as \u201cThere are at least two books\u201d would be\nrecast as statements such as \u201cThere is a book, x, and\nthere is a book, y, and x is not identical to\ny.\u201d Statements such as \u201cThere are exactly two\nbooks\u201d would be recast as \u201cThere is a book, x,\nand there is a book, y, and x is not identical to\ny, and if there is a book, z, then z is\nidentical to either x or y.\u201d It follows that\nnumber-theoretic operations may then be explained in terms of\nset-theoretic operations such as intersection, union, and difference.\nIn Principia Mathematica, Whitehead and Russell were able to\nprovide many detailed derivations of major theorems in set theory,\nfinite and transfinite arithmetic, and elementary measure theory. They\nwere also able to develop a sophisticated theory of logical relations\nand a unique method of founding the real numbers. Even so, the issue\nof whether set theory itself can be said to have been successfully\nreduced to logic remained controversial. A fourth volume on geometry\nwas planned but never completed.\n\nRussell\u2019s most important writings relating to these topics\ninclude not only his Principles of Mathematics (1903),\n\u201cMathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types\u201d\n(1908), and Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913), but\nalso his earlier Essay on the Foundations of Geometry (1897)\nand his Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy (1919a), the\nlast of which was written while Russell was serving time in Brixton\nPrison as a result of his anti-war activities. Coincidentally, it was\nat roughly this same time that\n Ludwig Wittgenstein,\n Russell\u2019s most famous pupil, was completing his Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus (1921) while being detained as a prisoner of\nwar at Monte Cassino in Italy during World War I. \n\nAnyone needing assistance in deciphering the symbolism found in the\nmore technical of Russell\u2019s writings is encouraged to consult\nthe\n Notation in Principia Mathematica\n entry in this encyclopedia.\n",
