    "preamble": "\n\nJacques Derrida (1930\u20132004) was the founder of\n\u201cdeconstruction,\u201d a way of criticizing not only both\nliterary and philosophical texts but also political institutions.\nAlthough Derrida at times expressed regret concerning the fate of the\nword \u201cdeconstruction,\u201d its popularity indicates the\nwide-ranging influence of his thought, in philosophy, in literary\ncriticism and theory, in art and, in particular, architectural theory,\nand in political theory. Indeed, Derrida\u2019s fame nearly reached\nthe status of a media star, with hundreds of people filling\nauditoriums to hear him speak, with films and television programs\ndevoted to him, with countless books and articles devoted to his\nthinking. Beside critique, Derridean deconstruction consists in an\nattempt to re-conceive the difference that divides self-consciousness\n(the difference of the \u201cof\u201d in consciousness of oneself).\nBut even more than the re-conception of difference, and perhaps more\nimportantly, deconstruction attempts to render justice. Indeed,\ndeconstruction is relentless in this pursuit since justice is\nimpossible to achieve.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nDerrida was born on July 15, 1930 in El-Biar (a suburb of Algiers),\nAlgeria (then a part of France), into a Sephardic Jewish family.\nBecause Derrida\u2019s writing concerns auto-bio-graphy (writing\nabout one\u2019s life as a form of relation to oneself), many of his\nwritings are auto-biographical. So, for instance in Monolingualism\nof the Other (1998), Derrida recounts how, when he was in the\n\u201clyc\u00e9e\u201d (high school), the Vichy regime in France\nproclaimed certain interdictions concerning the native languages of\nAlgeria, in particular Berber. Derrida calls his experience of the\n\u201cinterdiction\u201d \u201cunforgettable and\ngeneralizable\u201d (1998, p. 37). In fact, the \u201cJewish\nlaws\u201d passed by the Vichy regime interrupted his high school\nstudies.\n\nImmediately after World War II, Derrida started to study philosophy.\nIn 1949, he moved to Paris, where he prepared for the entrance exam in\nphilosophy for the prestigious \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure.\nDerrida failed his first attempt at this exam, but passed it in his\nsecond try in 1952. In one of the many eulogies that he wrote for\nmembers of his generation, Derrida recounts that, as he went into the\ncourtyard toward the building in which he would sit for the second\ntry, Gilles Deleuze passed him, smiling and saying, \u201cMy thoughts\nare with you, my very best thoughts.\u201d Indeed, Derrida entered\nthe \u00c9cole Normale at a time when a remarkable generation of\nphilosophers and thinkers was coming of age. We have already mentioned\nDeleuze, but there was also Foucault, Althusser, Lyotard, Barthes, and\nMarin. Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Levi-Strauss, Lacan,\nRic\u0153ur, Blanchot, and Levinas were still alive. The Fifties in\nFrance was the time of phenomenology, and Derrida studied closely\nHusserl\u2019s then published works as well as some of the archival\nmaterial that was then available. The result was a Masters thesis from\nthe academic year 1953\u201354 called The Problem of Genesis in\nHusserl\u2019s Philosophy; Derrida published this text in 1990.\nMost importantly, at the \u00c9cole Normale, Derrida studied Hegel\nwith Jean Hyppolite. Hyppolite (along with Maurice de Gandillac) was\nto direct Derrida\u2019s doctoral thesis, \u201cThe Ideality of the\nLiterary Object\u201d; Derrida never completed this thesis. His\nstudies with Hyppolite however led Derrida to a noticeably Hegelian\nreading of Husserl, one already underway through the works of\nHusserl\u2019s assistant, Eugen Fink. Derrida claimed in his 1980\nspeech \u201cThe Time of a Thesis\u201d (presented on the occasion\nof him finally receiving his doctorate) that he never studied\nMerleau-Ponty and Sartre and that especially he never subscribed to\ntheir readings of Husserl and phenomenology in general. With so much\nMerleau-Ponty archival material available, it is possible now however\nto see similarities between Merleau-Ponty\u2019s final studies of\nHusserl and Derrida\u2019s first studies. Nevertheless, even if one\nknows Merleau-Ponty\u2019s thought well, one is taken aback by\nDerrida\u2019s one hundred and fifty page long Introduction to his\nFrench translation of Husserl\u2019s \u201cThe Origin of\nGeometry\u201d (1962). Derrida\u2019s Introduction looks to be a\nradically new understanding of Husserl insofar as Derrida stresses the\nproblem of language in Husserl\u2019s thought of history.\n\nThe 1960s is a decade of great achievement for this generation of\nFrench thinkers. 1961 sees the publication of Foucault\u2019s\nmonumental History of Madness (Madness and\nCivilization). At this time, Derrida is participating in a\nseminar taught by Foucault; on the basis of it, he will write\n\u201cCogito and the History of Madness\u201d (1963), in which he\ncriticizes Foucault\u2019s early thought, especially Foucault\u2019s\ninterpretation of Descartes. \u201cCogito and the History of\nMadness\u201d will result in a rupture between Derrida and Foucault,\nwhich will never fully heal. In the early 60s, Derrida reads Heidegger\nand Levinas carefully. The recently published lecture course from\n1964\u20131965, Heidegger: The Question of Being and\nHistory, allows us to see how Derrida developed his questions to\nHeidegger. In 1964, Derrida publishes a long two part essay on\nLevinas, \u201cViolence and Metaphysics.\u201d It is hard to\ndetermine which of Derrida\u2019s early essays is the most important,\nbut certainly \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d has to be a\nleading candidate.\n\nWhat comes through clearly in \u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d\nis Derrida\u2019s great sympathy for Levinas\u2019s thought of\nalterity, and at the same it is clear that Derrida is taking some\ndistance from Levinas\u2019s thought. Despite this distance,\n\u201cViolence and Metaphysics\u201d will open up a lifetime\nfriendship with Levinas. In 1967 (at the age of thirty-seven), Derrida\nhas his \u201cannus mirabilis,\u201d publishing three books at once:\nWriting and Difference, Voice and Phenomenon, and\nOf Grammatology. In all three, Derrida uses the word\n\u201cdeconstruction\u201d (to which we shall return below) in\npassing to describe his project. The word catches on immediately and\ncomes to define Derrida\u2019s thought. From then on up to the\npresent, the word is bandied about, especially in the Anglophone\nworld. It comes to be associated with a form of writing and thinking\nthat is illogical and imprecise. It must be noted that Derrida\u2019s\nstyle of writing contributed not only to his great popularity but also\nto the great animosity some felt towards him. His style is frequently\nmore literary than philosophical and therefore more evocative than\nargumentative.\n\nCertainly, Derrida\u2019s style is not traditional. In the same\nspeech from 1980 at the time of him being awarded a doctorate, Derrida\ntells us that, in the Seventies, he devoted himself to developing a\nstyle of writing. The most clearest example is his 1974 Glas\n(\u201cDeath Knell\u201d would be an approximate English\ntranslation; the current English translation simply uses the word\n\u201cglas\u201d); here Derrida writes in two columns, with the left\ndevoted to a reading of Hegel and the right devoted to a reading of\nthe French novelist-playwright Jean Genet. Another example would be\nhis 1980 Postcard from Socrates to Freud and Beyond; the\nopening two hundred pages of this book consist of love letters\naddressed to no one in particular. It seems that sometime around this\ntime (1980), Derrida reverted back to the more linear and somewhat\nargumentative style, the very style that defined his texts from the\nSixties. He never however renounced a kind of evocation, a calling\nforth that truly defines deconstruction. Derrida takes the idea of a\ncall from Heidegger. Starting in 1968 with \u201cThe Ends of\nMan,\u201d Derrida devoted a number of texts to Heidegger\u2019s\nthought. But, it is really with the 1978 publication of The Truth\nin Painting, and then throughout the 1980s, that Derrida\nintensified his reading of Heidegger. In particular, he wrote a series\nof essays on the question of sex or race in Heidegger\n(\u201cGeschlecht I\u2013IV\u201d). While frequently critical,\nthese essays often provide new insights into Heidegger\u2019s\nthought. The culminating essay in Derrida\u2019s series on Heidegger\nis his 1992 Aporias.\n\nWhile Derrida\u2019s intensive work on Husserl and phenomenology was\nprimarily limited to the late 1960s, and to the publication of\nVoice and Phenomenon in 1967, this one book produced many\ncriticisms of his reading of Husserl. Most notable is J. Claude\nEvans\u2019 Strategies of Deconstruction: Derrida and the Myth of\nthe Voice in 1991 (for other criticisms, see Bernet 1988, Brough\n1993, Mohanty 1997, and Zahavi 1999). Although throughout his career\nDerrida would mention Husserl in passing, he surprisingly wrote a\nchapter on Husserl in his Touching: Jean-Luc Nancy. One of\nthe places where he mentions Husserl is his 1971 address to a\ncommunication conference in Montreal, \u201cSignature Event\nContext.\u201d He publishes this article as the final chapter of\nMargins of Philosophy in 1972. While \u201cSignature Event\nContext\u201d contains a short discussion of Husserl, its real focus\nis Austin\u2019s speech act theory. The connection Derrida makes\nbetween Husserl\u2019s phenomenology and Austin\u2019s speech act\ntheory is that both reject citations from the realm of meaningfulness\n(Husserl) or of the performative (Austin). (Speech theory had a\nsubstantial influence on French philosophy at this moment, and Derrida\nwould continue to refer to the constative/performative distinction\nthroughout his career.) In any case, the English translation of\n\u201cSignature Event Context\u201d appeared in the first volume of\nthe new journal Glyph in 1977. The editor of Glyph,\nSam Weber, invited John Searle to write a response to \u201cSignature\nEvent Context.\u201d In his response, \u201cReiterating the\nDifferences: A Reply to Derrida,\u201d Searle points out a number of\nflaws in Derrida\u2019s argumentation and his understanding of\nAustin. For the second volume of Glyph (also published in\n1977), Derrida contributed a response to Searle\u2019s\n\u201cReply\u201d called \u201cLimited Inc a b c.\u201d In\ncontrast to Searle\u2019s ten page \u201cReply,\u201d\nDerrida\u2019s \u201cLimited Inc\u201d ran to ninety pages.\nDerrida\u2019s \u201cLimited Inc\u201d is an almost merciless\ncriticism of Searle, whom he calls \u201cSarl.\u201d For instance,\nhe points out that Searle in his \u201cReply\u201d hardly mentions\nsignature, event, or context. \u201cLimited Inc\u201d indicates\nDerrida\u2019s growing frustration with the reception of his work,\nespecially in the Anglophone world. His frustration must have\nculminated when he was offered an honorary degree at Cambridge\nUniversity in 1992. A group of analytic philosophers wrote an open\nletter\n (available online)\n to the Times of London, in which they objected to Derrida\nreceiving this honorary degree. Despite the letter, Cambridge\nUniversity awarded Derrida the degree.\n\nThroughout the Sixties, having been invited by Hyppolite and\nAlthusser, Derrida taught at the \u00c9cole Normale. In 1983, he\nbecame \u201cDirector of Studies\u201d in \u201cPhilosophical\nInstitutions\u201d at the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en\nSciences Sociales in Paris; he will hold this position until his\ndeath. Starting in the Seventies, Derrida held many appointments in\nAmerican universities, in particular Johns Hopkins University and Yale\nUniversity. From 1987, Derrida taught one semester a year at the\nUniversity of California at Irvine. Derrida\u2019s close relationship\nwith Irvine led to the establishment of the Derrida archives there.\nAlso during the Seventies, Derrida associated himself with GREPH\n(\u201cLe Groupe de Recherche sur l\u2019Enseignement\nPhilosophique,\u201d in English: \u201cThe Group Investigating the\nTeaching of Philosophy\u201d). As its name suggests, this group\ninvestigated how philosophy is taught in the high schools and\nuniversities in France. Derrida wrote several texts based on this\nresearch, many of which were collected in Du droit \u00e0 la\nphilosophie (1990, one part of this book has been translated into\nEnglish as Eyes of the University. Right to Philosophy 2). In\n1982, Derrida was also one of the founders of the Coll\u00e8ge\nInternationale de Philosophie in Paris, and served as its first\ndirector from 1982 to 1984.\n\nIn the 1990s, Derrida\u2019s works went in two simultaneous\ndirections that tend to intersect and overlap with one another:\npolitics and religion. These two directions were probably first\nclearly evident in Derrida\u2019s 1989 \u201cForce of Law.\u201d\nBut one can see them better in his 1993 Specters of Marx,\nwhere Derrida insisted that a deconstructed (or criticized) Marxist\nthought is still relevant to today\u2019s world despite globalization\nand that a deconstructed Marxism consists in a new messianism, a\nmessianism of a \u201cdemocracy to come.\u201d But, even though\nDerrida was approaching the end of his life, he produced many\ninteresting texts in the Nineties and into the new century. For\ninstance, Derrida\u2019s 1996 text on Levinas, \u201cA Word of\nWelcome,\u201d lays out the most penetrating logic of the same and\nother through a discussion of hospitality. In his final works on\nsovereignty, in particular, Rogues (2003), Derrida shows that\nthe law always contains the possibility of suspension, which means\nthat even the most democratic of nations (the United States for\nexample) resembles a \u201crogue state\u201d or perhaps is the most\n\u201croguish\u201d of all states. Based on lectures first presented\nduring the summer of 1998,The Animal that Therefore I am)\nappeared as the first posthumous work in 2006; concerning animality,\nit indicates Derrida\u2019s continuous interest in the question of\nlife. We see this interest in life also in Derrida\u2019s lectures on\nthe death penalty, where he questions the meaning of cruelty (which is\nmore cruel, the death penalty or life in prison?). Animal life and\npower is the theme of Derrida\u2019s last lecture courses on\n\u201cThe Beast and the Sovereign.\u201d (For a study of this final\ncourse, see Krell 2013.)\n\nSometime in 2002, Derrida was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He\ndied on October 8, 2004. Since his death two biographies have appeared\n(Powell 2006 and Peeters 2013).\n2. \u201cThe Incorruptibles\u201d\n\nAs we noted, Derrida became famous at the end of the 1960s, with the\npublication of three books in 1967. At this time, other great books\nappear: Foucault\u2019s Les mots et les choses (The\nOrder of Things is the English language title) in 1966;\nDeleuze\u2019s Difference and Repetition in 1968. It is hard\nto deny that the philosophy publications of this epoch indicate that\nwe have before us a kind of philosophical moment (a moment perhaps\ncomparable to the moment of German Idealism at the beginning of the\n19th century). H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous calls this\ngeneration of French philosophers \u201cthe incorruptibles.\u201d In\nthe last interview Derrida gave (to Le Monde on August 19,\n2004), he provided an interpretation of \u201cthe\nincorruptibles\u201d: \u201cBy means of metonymy, I call this\napproach [of \u2018the incorruptibles\u2019] an intransigent, even\nincorruptible, ethos of writing and thinking \u2026,\nwithout concession even to philosophy, and not letting public opinion,\nthe media, or the phantasm of an intimidating readership frighten or\nforce us into simplifying or repressing. Hence the strict taste for\nrefinement, paradox, and aporia.\u201d Derrida proclaims that today,\nmore than ever, \u201cthis predilection [for paradox and aporia]\nremains a requirement.\u201d How are we to understand this\nrequirement, this predilection for \u201crefinement, paradox, and\naporia\u201d?\n\nIn an essay from 1998, \u201cTypewriter Ribbon,\u201d Derrida\ninvestigates the relation of confession to archives. But, before he\nstarts the investigation (which will concern primarily Rousseau), he\nsays, \u201cLet us put in place the premises of our question.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cWill this be possible for us? Will we one day be able\nto, and in a single gesture, to join the thinking of the event to the\nthinking of the machine? Will we be able to think, what is called\nthinking, at one and the same time, both what is happening (we call\nthat an event) and the calculable programming of an automatic\nrepetition (we call that a machine). For that, it would be necessary\nin the future (but there will be no future except on this condition)\nto think both the event and the machine as two compatible or even\nin-dissociable concepts. Today they appear to us to be\nantinomic\u201d (Without Alibi, p. 72). These two concepts\nappear to us to be antinomic because we conceive an event as something\nsingular and non-repeatable. Moreover, Derrida associates this\nsingularity to the living. The living being undergoes a sensation and\nthis sensation (an affect or feeling for example) gets inscribed in\norganic material. The idea of an inscription leads Derrida to the\nother pole. The machine that inscribes is based in repetition;\n\u201cIt is destined, that is, to reproduce impassively,\nimperceptibly, without organ or organicity, the received commands. In\na state of anaesthesis, it would obey or command a calculable program\nwithout affect or auto-affection, like an indifferent automaton\u201d\n(Without Alibi, p. 73). The automatic nature of the inorganic\nmachine is not the spontaneity attributed to organic life. It is easy\nto see the incompatibility of the two concepts: organic, living\nsingularity (the event) and inorganic, dead universality (mechanical\nrepetition). Derrida says that, if we can make these two concepts\ncompatible, \u201cyou can bet not only (and I insist on not only)\nwill one have produced a new logic, an unheard of conceptual form. In\ntruth, against the background and at the horizon of our present\npossibilities, this new figure would resemble a monster.\u201d The\nmonstrosity of this paradox between event and repetition announces,\nperhaps, another kind of thinking, an impossible thinking: the\nimpossible event (there must be resemblance to the past which cancels\nthe singularity of the event) and the only possible event (since any\nevent in order to be event worthy of its name must be singular and\nnon-resembling). Derrida concludes this discussion by saying:\n\u201cTo give up neither the event nor the machine, to subordinate\nneither one to the other, neither to reduce one to the other: this is\nperhaps a concern of thinking that has kept a certain number of\n\u2018us\u2019 working for the last few decades\u201d (Without\nAlibi, p. 74). This \u201cus\u201d refers to Derrida\u2019s\ngeneration of thinkers: \u201cthe incorruptibles.\u201d What Derrida\nsays here defines a general project which consists in trying to\nconceive the relation between machine-like repeatability and\nirreplaceable singularity neither as a relation of externality\n(external as in Descartes\u2019s two substance or as in\nPlatonism\u2019s two worlds) nor as a relation of homogeneity (any\nform of reductionism would suffice here to elucidate a homogeneous\nrelation). Instead, the relation is one in which the elements are\ninternal to one another and yet remain heterogeneous. Derrida\u2019s\nfamous term \u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d (to which we shall return\nbelow) refers to this relation in which machine-like repeatability is\ninternal to irreplaceable singularity and yet the two remain\nheterogeneous to one another.\n\nOf course, Cixous intends with the word \u201cincorruptibles\u201d\nthat the generation of French philosophers who came of age in the\nSixties, what they wrote and did, will never decay, will remain\nendlessly new and interesting. This generation will remain pure. But,\nthe term is particularly appropriate for Derrida, since his thought\nconcerns precisely the idea of purity and therefore contamination.\nContamination, in Derrida, implies that an opposition consisting in\ntwo pure poles separated by an indivisible line never exists. In other\nwords, traditionally (going back to Plato\u2019s myths but also\nChristian theology), we think that there was an original pure state of\nbeing (direct contact with the forms or the Garden of Eden) which\naccidentally became corrupt. In contrast, Derrida tries to show that\nno term or idea or reality is ever pure in this way; one term always\nand necessarily \u201cinfects\u201d the other.\n\nNevertheless, for Derrida, a kind of purity remains as a value. In his\n1992 The Monolingualism of the Other, Derrida speaks of his\n\u201cshameful intolerance\u201d for anything but the purity of the\nFrench language (as opposed to French contaminated with English words\nlike \u201cle weekend\u201d). Derrida says, \u201cI still do not\ndare admit this compulsive demand for a purity of language except\nwithin boundaries of which I can be sure: this demand is neither\nethical, political, nor social. It does not inspire any judgment in\nme. It simply exposes me to suffering when someone, who can be myself,\nhappens to fall short of it. I suffer even further when I catch myself\nor am caught \u2018red-handed\u2019 in the act. \u2026 Above all,\nthis demand remains so inflexible that it sometimes goes beyond the\ngrammatical point of view, it even neglects \u2018style\u2019 in\norder to bow to a more hidden rule, to \u2018listen\u2019 to the\ndomineering murmur of an order which someone in me flatters himself to\nunderstand, even in situations where he would be the only one to do\nso, in a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the idiom, the final\ntarget: a last will of the language, in sum, a law of the language\nthat would entrust itself only to me. \u2026I therefore admit to a\npurity which is not very pure. Anything but a purism. It is, at least,\nthe only impure \u2018purity\u2019 for which I dare confess a\ntaste\u201d (Monolingualism, p. 46). Derrida\u2019s taste\nfor purity is such that he seeks the idioms of a language. The idioms\nof a language are what make the language singular. An idiom is so pure\nthat we seem unable to translate it out of that language. For example,\nDerrida always connects the French idiom \u201cil faut,\u201d\n\u201cit is necessary,\u201d to \u201cune faute,\u201d \u201ca\nfault\u201d and to \u201cun d\u00e9faut,\u201d \u201ca\ndefect\u201d; but we cannot make this linguistic connection between\nnecessity and a fault in English. This idiom seems to belong alone to\nFrench; it seems as though it cannot be shared; so far, there is no\nbabble of several languages in the one sole French language. And yet,\neven within one language, an idiom can be shared. Here is another\nFrench idiom: \u201cil y va d\u2019un certain pas.\u201d Even in\nFrench, this idiom can be \u201ctranslated.\u201d On the one hand,\nif one takes the \u201cil y va\u201d literally, one has a sentence\nabout movement to a place (\u201cy\u201d: there) at a certain pace\n(\u201cun certain pas\u201d: a certain step). On the other hand, if\none takes the \u201cil y va\u201d idiomatically (\u201cil y\nva\u201d: what is at issue), one has a sentence (perhaps more\nphilosophical) about the issue of negation (\u201cun certain\npas\u201d: \u201ca certain kind of not\u201d). This undecidability\nin how to understand an idiom within one sole language indicates that,\nalready in French, in the one French language, there is already\ntranslation and, as Derrida would say, \u201cBabelization.\u201d\nTherefore, for Derrida, \u201ca pure language\u201d means a language\nwhose terms necessarily include a plurality of senses that cannot be\nreduced down to one sense that is the proper meaning. In other words,\nthe taste for purity in Derrida is a taste for impropriety and\ntherefore impurity. The value of purity in Derrida means that anyone\nwho conceives language in terms of proper or pure meanings must be\ncriticized.\n3. Basic Argumentation and its Implications: Time, Hearing-Oneself-Speak, the Secret, and Sovereignty\n\nAlready we are very close to Derrida\u2019s basic argumentation. The\nbasic argumentation always attempts to show that no one is able to\nseparate irreplaceable singularity and machine-like repeatability (or\n\u201citerability,\u201d as Derrida frequently says) into two\nsubstances that stand outside of one another; nor is anyone able to\nreduce one to the other so that we would have one pure substance (with\nattributes or modifications). Machine-like repeatability and\nirreplaceable singularity, for Derrida, are like two forces that\nattract one another across a limit that is indeterminate and\ndivisible. Yet, to understand the basic argumentation, we must be, as\nDerrida himself says in Rogues, \u201cresponsible guardians\nof the heritage of transcendental idealism\u201d (Rogues, p.\n134; see also Limited Inc, p. 93). Kant had of course opened\nup the possibility of this way of philosophizing: arguing back (Kant\ncalled this arguing back a \u201cdeduction\u201d) from the givenness\nof experience to the conditions that are necessarily required for the\nway experience is given. These conditions would function as a\nfoundation for all experience. Following Kant (but also Husserl and\nHeidegger), Derrida then is always interested in necessary and\nfoundational conditions of experience.\n\nSo, let us start with the simplest argument that we can formulate. If\nwe reflect on experience in general, what we cannot deny is that\nexperience is conditioned by time. Every experience, necessarily,\ntakes place in the present. In the present experience, there is the\nkernel or point of the now. What is happening right now is a kind of\nevent, different from every other now I have ever experienced. Yet,\nalso in the present, I remember the recent past and I anticipate what\nis about to happen. The memory and the anticipation consist in\nrepeatability. Because what I experience now can be immediately\nrecalled, it is repeatable and that repeatability therefore motivates\nme to anticipate the same thing happening again. Therefore, what is\nhappening right now is also not different from every other\nnow I have ever experienced. At the same time, the present\nexperience is an event and it is not an event because it is\nrepeatable. This \u201cat the same time\u201d is the crux of the\nmatter for Derrida. The conclusion is that we can have no experience\nthat does not essentially and inseparably contain these two agencies\nof event and repeatability.\n\nThis basic argument contains four important implications.\nFirst, experience as the experience of the present is never a\nsimple experience of something present over and against me, right\nbefore my eyes as in an intuition; there is always another agency\nthere. Repeatability contains what has passed away and is no longer\npresent and what is about to come and is not yet present. The\npresent therefore is always complicated by non-presence. Derrida calls\nthis minimal repeatability found in every experience \u201cthe\ntrace.\u201d Indeed, the trace is a kind of proto-linguisticality\n(Derrida also calls it \u201carche-writing\u201d), since language in\nits most minimal determination consists in repeatable forms.\nSecond, the argument has disturbed the traditional structure\nof transcendental philosophy, which consists in a linear relation\nbetween foundational conditions and founded experience. In traditional\ntranscendental philosophy (as in Kant for example), an empirical event\nsuch as what is happening right now is supposed to be\nderivative from or founded upon conditions which are not\nempirical. Yet, Derrida\u2019s basic argument demonstrates that the\nempirical event is a non-separable part of the structural or\nfoundational conditions. Or, in traditional transcendental philosophy,\nthe empirical event is supposed to be an accident that overcomes an\nessential structure. But with Derrida\u2019s argument, we see that\nthis accident cannot be removed or eliminated. We can describe this\nsecond implication in still another way. In traditional philosophy we\nalways speak of a kind of first principle or origin and that origin is\nalways conceived as self-identical (again something like a Garden of\nEden principle). Yet, here we see that the origin is immediately\ndivided, as if the \u201cfall\u201d into division, accidents, and\nempirical events has always already taken place. In Of\nSpirit, Derrida calls this kind of origin\n\u201corigin-heterogeneous\u201d: the origin is heterogeneous\nimmediately (Of Spirit, pp. 107\u2013108). Third,\nif the origin is always heterogeneous, then nothing is ever given\nas such in certainty. Whatever is given is given as other\nthan itself, as already past or as still to come. What becomes\nfoundational therefore in Derrida is this \u201cas\u201d: origin as\nthe heterogeneous \u201cas.\u201d The \u201cas\u201d means that\nthere is no knowledge as such, there is no truth as such, there is no\nperception, no intuition of anything as such. Faith, perjury, and\nlanguage are already there in the origin. Fourth, if\nsomething like a fall has always already taken place, has taken place\nessentially or necessarily, then every experience contains an aspect\nof lateness. It seems as though I am always late for the origin since\nit seems to have always already disappeared. Every experience then is\nalways not quite on time or, as Derrida quotes Hamlet, time is\n\u201cout of joint.\u201d Late in his career, Derrida will call this\ntime being out of joint \u201canachronism\u201d (see for instance\nOn the Name, p. 94). As we shall see in a moment, anachronism\nfor Derrida is the flip side of what he calls \u201cspacing\u201d\n(espacement); space is out of place. But we should also keep\nin mind, as we move forward that the phrase \u201cout of joint\u201d\nalludes to justice: being out of joint, time is necessarily unjust or\nviolent.\n\nSo far, we can say that the argument is quite simple although it has\nwide-ranging implications. It is based on an analysis of experience,\nbut it is also based in the experience of what Derrida has called\n\u201cauto-affection.\u201d We find the idea of auto-affection (or\nself-affection) in ancient Greek philosophy, for example in\nAristotle\u2019s definition of God as \u201cthought thinking\nitself.\u201d Auto-affection occurs when I affect myself, when the\naffecting is the same as the affected. As we said above, Derrida will\nfrequently write about autobiography as a form of auto-affection or\nself-relation. In the very late The Animal that Therefore I\nam, Derrida tells us what he is trying to do with auto-affection:\n\u201cif the auto-position, the automonstrative autotely of\nthe \u2018I,\u2019 even in the human, implies the \u2018I\u2019 to\nbe an other that must welcome within itself some irreducible\nhetero-affection (as I [that is, Derrida] have tried to demonstrate\nelsewhere [my emphasis]), then this autonomy of the\n\u2018I\u2019 can be neither pure nor rigorous; it would not be able\nto form the basis for a simple and linear differentiation of the human\nfrom the animal\u201d (The Animal that Therefore I am, p.\n95). Always, Derrida tries to show that auto-affection is\nhetero-affection; the experience of the same (I am thinking about\nmyself) is the experience of the other (insofar as I think about\nmyself I am thinking of someone or something else at the same time).\nBut, in order to understand more fully the basic argumentation, let us\nlook at three of these \u201cother places\u201d where Derrida has\n\u201cattempted\u201d to show that an irreducible hetero-affection\ninfects auto-affection.\n\nThe first occurs in Voice and Phenomenon, Derrida\u2019s\n1967 study of Husserl. While this is a small book, it aims to\ncriticize what Husserl calls the \u201cprinciple of all\nprinciples\u201d for phenomenology, that is, that evidentness is\nbased in an intuition, intuition being different from a sign (Husserl\n2014, 43\u201344, paragraph 24). In Voice and Phenomenon\nDerrida recognizes that perception, for Husserl, is that of\nadumbrations, with an intentional meaning unifying the different\nprofiles. However, Derrida sees in the principle of all principles and\nin Husserl\u2019s introduction of an Idea in the Kantian sense\n(Husserl 2014, 284\u2013285, paragraph 143) the imposition of a telos\nfor perception towards a pure intuition, pure presence or givenness,\nuncontaminated by signification.\n\nMore specifically, Derrida argues that, when Husserl describes\nlived-experience (Erlebnis), even absolute subjectivity, he\nis speaking of an interior monologue, auto-affection as\nhearing-oneself-speak. According to Derrida, hearing-oneself-speak is,\nfor Husserl, \u201can auto-affection of an absolutely unique\ntype\u201d (Voice and Phenomenon, p. 67). It is unique\nbecause there seems to be no external detour from the hearing to the\nspeaking; in hearing-oneself-speak there is self-proximity. It seems\ntherefore that I hear myself speak immediately in the very\nmoment that I am speaking. According to Derrida,\nHusserl\u2019s own description of temporalization however undermines\nthe idea that I hear myself speak immediately. On the one hand,\nHusserl describes what he calls the \u201cliving present,\u201d the\npresent that I am experiencing right now, and yet Husserl also says\nthat the living present is thick. The living present is thick because\nit includes phases other than the now, in particular, what Husserl\ncalls \u201cprotention,\u201d the anticipation (or\n\u201cawaiting,\u201d we might say) of the approaching future and\n\u201cretention,\u201d the memory of the recent past. As is well\nknown, Derrida focuses on the status of retention in Voice and\nPhenomenon. Retention in Husserl has a strange status since\nHusserl wants to include it in the present as a kind of perception and\nat the same time he recognizes that it is different from the present\nas a kind of non-perception. For Derrida, Husserl\u2019s descriptions\nimply that the living present, by always folding the recent past back\ninto itself, by always folding primary memory into the present\nperception, involves a difference in the very middle of it\n(Voice and Phenomenon, p. 56). In other words, in the very\nmoment, when silently I speak to myself, it must be the case that\nthere is a minuscule hiatus differentiating me into the speaker and\ninto the hearer. There must be a hiatus that differentiates me from\nmyself, a hiatus or gap without which I would not be a hearer as\nwell as a speaker. This hiatus also defines the trace, a minimal\nrepeatability. And this hiatus, this fold of repetition, is found in\nthe very moment of hearing-myself-speak. Derrida stresses that\n\u201cmoment\u201d or \u201cinstant\u201d translates the German\n\u201cAugenblick,\u201d which literally means \u201cblink of the\neye.\u201d When Derrida stresses the literal meaning of\n\u201cAugenblick,\u201d he is in effect \u201cdeconstructing\u201d\nauditory auto-affection into visual auto-affection. When I look in the\nmirror, for example, it is necessary that I am \u201cdistanced\u201d\nor \u201cspaced\u201d from the mirror. I must be distanced from\nmyself so that I am able to be both seer and seen.\nThe space between, however, remains obstinately invisible.\nRemaining invisible, the space gouges out the eye, blinds it. I see\nmyself over there in the mirror and yet, that self over there is other\nthan me; so, I am not able to see myself as such. What Derrida is\ntrying to demonstrate here is that this \u201cspacing\u201d\n(espacement) or blindness is essentially necessary for all\nforms of auto-affection, even tactile auto-affection which seems to be\nimmediate.\n\nNow, let us go to another \u201cother place,\u201d which can be\nfound in \u201cHow to Avoid Speaking.\u201d Here Derrida discusses\nnegative theology by means of the idea of\n\u201cd\u00e9n\u00e9gation,\u201d \u201cdenegation\u201d or\n\u201cdenial.\u201d The French word\n\u201cd\u00e9n\u00e9gation\u201d translates Freud\u2019s term\n\u201cVerneinung.\u201d Both words\u2019 prefixes imply an emphasis\nof negation (although the French prefix also implies a negation of a\nnegation). Yet, within psychoanalysis and in particular in Freud, the\nterm ,\u201cVerneinung\u201d implies that when the patient denies a\ndesire or wish, he or she has indicated to the analyst precisely what\nhe or she unconsciously desires or wishes. The denial then functions\nas a sort of disguised confirmation of the analyst\u2019s\ninterpretation of the patient\u2019s symptoms or problem. In short,\nand this is what Derrida is most interested in, psychoanalysis has\nisolated a negation which is in fact an affirmation. The fundamental\nquestion then for negative theology, but also for psychoanalysis, and\nfor Derrida is how to deny and yet also not deny. This\nduality between not telling and telling is why Derrida takes up the\nidea of the secret. In \u201cHow to Avoid Speaking,\u201d Derrida\nsays, and this is an important comment for understanding the secret in\nDerrida: \u201cThere is a secret of denial\n[d\u00e9n\u00e9gation] and a denial\n[d\u00e9n\u00e9gation] of the secret. The secret as\nsuch, as secret, separates and already institutes a negativity;\nit is a negation that denies itself. It de-negates itself\u201d\n(Languages of the Unsayable, p. 25, my emphasis). Here\nDerrida speaks of a secret as such. A secret as such is\nsomething that must not be spoken; we then have the first negation:\n\u201cI promise not to give the secret away.\u201d And yet,\nin order to possess a secret really, to have it\nreally, I must tell it to myself. Here we can see the\nrelation of hearing-oneself-speak that we just saw in Voice and\nPhenomenon. Keeping a secret includes necessarily auto-affection:\nI must speak to myself of the secret. We might however say more, we\nmight even say that I am too weak for this speaking of the secret to\nmyself not to happen. I must have a conceptual grasp of it; I have to\nframe a representation of the secret. With the idea of a\nre-presentation (I must present the secret to myself again in\norder to possess it really), we also see retention, repetition, and\nthe trace or a name. A trace of the secret must be formed, in which\ncase, the secret is in principle shareable. If the secret must be\nnecessarily shareable, it is always already shared. In other words, in\norder to frame the representation of the secret, I must negate the\nfirst negation, in which I promised not to tell the secret: I must\ntell the secret to myself as if I were someone else. I thereby make a\nsecond negation, a so to speak \u201cde-\u201d or\n\u201cun-negation,\u201d which means I must break the promise not to\ntell the secret. In order to keep the secret (or the promise), I must\nnecessarily not keep the secret (I must violate the promise). So, I\npossess the secret and do not possess it. This structure has the\nconsequence of there being no secret as such. A secret is\nnecessarily shared. As Derrida says in \u201cHow to Avoid\nSpeaking,\u201d\n\nThis denial [d\u00e9n\u00e9gation] does not happen [to\nthe secret] by accident; it is essential and originary. \u2026 The\nenigma \u2026 is the sharing of the secret, and not only shared to\nmy partner in the society but the secret shared within itself, its\n\u2018own\u2019 partition, which divides the essence of a secret\nthat cannot even appear to one alone except in starting to be lost, to\ndivulge itself, hence to dissimulate itself, as secret, in showing\nitself: dissimulating its dissimulation. There is no secret as such; I\ndeny it. And this is what I confide in secret to whomever allies\nhimself to me. This is the secret of the alliance. (Languages of\nthe Unsayable, p. 25)\n\n\nNow, finally, let us go to one of the most recent of Derrida\u2019s\nwritings, to his 2002 \u201cThe Reason of the Strongest,\u201d the\nfirst essay in the book called Rogues. There Derrida is\ndiscussing the United Nations, which he says combines the two\nprinciples of Western political thought: sovereignty and democracy.\nBut, \u201cdemocracy and sovereignty are at the same time, but also\nby turns, inseparable and in contradiction with one another\u201d\n(Rogues, p. 100). Democracy and sovereignty contradict one\nanother in the following way. And here Derrida is speaking of pure\nsovereignty, the very \u201cessence of sovereignty\u201d\n(Rogues, p. 100). On the one hand, in order to be sovereign,\none must wield power oneself, take responsibility for its use by\noneself, which means that the use of power, if it is to be sovereign,\nmust be silent; the sovereign does not have to give reasons; the\nsovereign must exercise power in secret. In other words, sovereignty\nattempts to possess power indivisibly, it tries not to share,\nand not sharing means contracting power into an instant\u2014the\ninstant of action, of an event, of a singularity. We can see the\noutline here of Derrida\u2019s deconstruction not only of the\nhearing-oneself-speak auto-affection but also of the auto-affection of\nthe promising-to-oneself to keep a secret. On the other hand,\ndemocracy calls for the sovereign to share power, to give reasons, to\nuniversalize. In democracy the use of power therefore is always an\nabuse of power (see Haddad 2013, pp. 51\u201365). Derrida can also\nsay that sovereignty and democracy are inseparable from one another\n(the contradiction makes them heterogeneous to one another) because\ndemocracy even though it calls for universalization (giving reasons in\nan assembly) also requires force, freedom, a decision, sovereign\npower. For Derrida, in democracy, a decision (the use of power) is\nalways urgent; and yet (here is the contradiction), democracy takes\ntime, democracy makes one wait so that the use of power can be\ndiscussed. Power can never be exercised without its communication; as\nDerrida says, \u201cAs soon as I speak to the other, I submit to the\nlaw of giving reason(s), I share a virtually universalizable medium, I\ndivide my authority\u201d (Rogues, p. 101). There must be\nsovereignty, and yet, there can be no use of power without the sharing\nof it through repetition. More precisely, as Derrida says,\n\u201cSince [sovereignty] never succeeds in [not sharing] except in a\ncritical, precarious, and unstable fashion, sovereignty can only\ntend, for a limited time, to reign without sharing. It can\nonly tend toward imperial hegemony. To make use of the time is already\nan abuse\u201d (Rogues, p. 102, Derrida\u2019s emphasis).\nThis tendency defines what Derrida calls \u201cthe worst,\u201d a\ntendency toward the complete appropriation or extermination of all the\nothers.\n4. Elaboration of the Basic Argumentation: The Worst and Hospitality\n\nThroughout his career, Derrida elaborates on the basic argumentation\nin many ways. But Derrida always uses the argumentation against one\nidea, which Derrida calls \u201cthe worst\u201d (le pire).\nWe can extract a definition of the worst from \u201cFaith and\nKnowledge\u201d (Religion, p. 65). It revolves around an\nambiguous phrase \u201cplus d\u2019un,\u201d which could be\ntranslated in English as \u201cmore than one,\u201d \u201cmore of\none,\u201d or \u201cno more one.\u201d On the one hand, this phrase\nmeans that in auto-affection, even while it is \u201cauto,\u201d the\nsame, there is more than one; immediately with one, there is two, the\nself and other, and others. On the other hand, it means that there is\na lot more of one, only one, the most one. The worst derives from this\nsecond sense of \u201cplus d\u2019un.\u201d The worst is a\nsuperlative; it is the worst violence. Derrida, it seems,\ndistinguishes the worst violence from what Kant had called\n\u201cradical evil.\u201d Radical evil is literally radical, evil at\nthe root. It consists in the small, \u201cinfinitesimal\ndifference\u201d (see Of Grammatology, p. 234) between me\nand an other, even between me and an other in me. Derrida would\ndescribe this infinitesimal hiatus as the address, the\n\u201c\u00e0\u201d or the \u201cto\u201d; it is not only\ndifference, across the distance of the address, it is also repetition.\nAnd, it is not only a repetition; this self-divergence is also\nviolence, a rending of oneself, an incision. Derrida\u2019s\nappropriation of Kant\u2019s idea of radical evil has led certain\ncommentators to stress a kind of fundamental atheism in Derrida\ndespite the fact that he seems very interested in religion and faith\n(see H\u00e4gglund, 2008, pp. 112\u2013113; for an opposing\nviewpoint, see Caputo, 1999, p. 312). Despite this controversy around\nDerrida\u2019s alleged theism or atheism, it looks as though, for\nhim, radical evil is not absolute evil (see Philosophy in a Time\nof Terror, p. 99). The worst violence occurs when the\nother to which one is related is completely appropriated to\nor completely in one\u2019s self, when an address reaches\nits proper destination, when it reaches only its\nproper destination. Reaching only its proper destination, the\naddress will exclude more, many more, and that \u201cmany\nmore,\u201d at the limit, amounts to all. It is this\ncomplete exclusion or this extermination of the most\n\u2013 there is no limit to this violence\u2014that makes this\nviolence the worst violence. The worst is a relation that makes of\nmore than one simply one, that makes, out of a division, an\nindivisible sovereignty. We can see again that the worst resembles the\n\u201cpure actuality\u201d of Aristotle\u2019s Prime Mover, the One\nGod: the sphere, or better, the globe of thought thinking\nitself (Rogues, p. 15).\n\nWhat we have just laid out is the structure of the worst in\nDerrida\u2019s thinking. But the structure, for Derrida, can always\nhappen as an event. Derrida thinks that today, \u201cin a time of\nterror,\u201d after the end of the Cold War, when globalization is\ntaking place, the fragility of the nation-state is being tested more\nand more. Agencies such as the International Criminal Court, the\ndemand for universal human rights encroach on nation-state\nsovereignty. But the result of this universalization or\n\u201cworlding\u201d (\u201cmondialisation\u201d is the French\nword for globalization) is that the concept of war, and thus of world\nwar, of enemy, and even of terrorism, along with the distinctions\nbetween civilian and military or between army, police, and militia,\nall of these concepts and distinctions are losing their pertinence. As\nDerrida says here in Rogues \u201cwhat is called September\n11 will not have created or revealed this situation, although it will\nhave surely media-theatricalized it\u201d (Rogues, pp.\n154\u201355). Now, with globalization, there is no identifiable enemy\nin the form of a \u201cstate\u201d territory with whom one (in\nRogues Derrida uses this phrase: \u201cthe United States and\nits allies\u201d) would wage what could still be called a\n\u201cwar,\u201d even if we think of this as a war on international\nterrorism. The balance of terror of the Cold War that insured that no\nescalation of nuclear weapons would lead to a suicidal operation,\nDerrida says, \u201call that is over.\u201d Instead, \u201ca new\nviolence is being prepared and in truth has been unleashed for some\ntime now, in a way that is more visibly suicidal or auto-immune than\never. This violence no longer has to do with world war or\neven with war, even less with some right to wage war. And\nthis is hardly re-assuring \u2013 indeed, quite the contrary\u201d\n(Rogues, p. 156).\n\nWhat does it mean to be \u201cmore suicidal\u201d? To be more\nsuicidal is to kill oneself more. The \u201cmore\u201d\nmeans that, since there is only a fragile distinction between states\n(there is no identification of the enemy), one\u2019s state or self\nincludes more and more of the others. But, if one\u2019s self\nincludes others that threaten (so-called \u201cterrorist\ncells,\u201d for example), then, if one wants to immune oneself, then\none must murder more and more of those others that are inside. Since\nthe others are inside one\u2019s state or one\u2019s self,\none is required to kill more and more of oneself. This context is very\ndifferent from the rigid and external opposition, symbolized by the\nso-called \u201cIron Curtain,\u201d that defined the Cold War. There\nand then, \u201cwe\u201d had an identifiable enemy, with a\nname, which allowed the number of the enemies to be limited.\nBut here and now, today, the number of \u201cenemies\u201d is\npotentially unlimited. Every other is wholly other\n(\u201ctout autre est tout autre\u201d [cf. The\nPolitics of Friendship, p. 232]) and thus every single other\nneeds to be rejected by the immune system. This innumerable rejection\nresembles a genocide or what is worse an absolute threat. The absolute\nthreat can no longer be contained when it comes neither from an\nalready constituted state nor even from a potential state that might\nbe treated as a rogue state (Rogues, p. 105). What Derrida is\nsaying here is that the worst is possible, here and now, more\npossible than ever.\n\nAs I said, Derrida always uses the basic argumentation that we have\nlaid out against the idea of the worst; today the tendency towards the\nworst is greater than ever. The purpose in the application \u2013\nthis purpose defines deconstruction\u2014is to move us towards, not\nthe worst violence, not the most violence, but the least violence\n(Writing and Difference, p. 130). How does the application of\nthe argumentation against the worst work? Along with globalization,\nthe post-Cold War period sees, as Derrida says in \u201cFaith and\nKnowledge,\u201d a \u201creturn of the religious\u201d\n(Religion, pp. 42\u201343; see also Caputo 1997, pp.\n152\u2013159). So, in \u201cFaith and Knowledge,\u201d Derrida lays\nout the etymology of the Latin word \u201creligion\u201d (he\nacknowledges that the etymology is problematic). The etymology implies\nthat there are \u201ctwo sources\u201d of religion:\n\u201creligio,\u201d which implies a holding back or a being\nunscathed, safe and sound; and \u201cre-legere,\u201d which implies\na linking up with another through faith (Religion, p. 16). We\ncan see in this etymology the inseparable dualities we examined above:\nsingular event and machine-like repeatability; auto-affection as\nhetero-affection. Most importantly, Derrida is trying to understand\nthe \u201clink\u201d that defines religion prior to the link between\nman as such and the divinity of God. What we can see in this attempt\nto conceive the link as it is prior to its determination in terms of\nman and God is an attempt to make the link be as open as possible.\nDerrida is attempting to \u201cun-close,\u201d as much as possible,\nthe sphericity or englobing of thought thinking itself \u2013 in\norder to open the link as wide as possible, open it to every single\nother, to any other whatsoever. Throughout his career, Derrida is\nalways interested in the status of animality since it determines the\nlimit between man and others. As his final book demonstrates,\nL\u2019animal que donc je suis, Derrida is attempting to\nopen the link even to animals. Animals are other and, because\n\u201cevery other is wholly other\u201d (tout autre est tout\nautre), the link must be open to them too. Here despite the\nimmense influence they have had on his thought, Derrida breaks with\nboth Heidegger and Levinas both of whom did not open the link this\nwide (see Points, p. 279). Here, with the \u201cdoor\u201d\nor \u201cborder\u201d open as wide as possible, we encounter\nDerrida\u2019s idea of \u201cunconditional hospitality,\u201d which\nmeans letting others in no matter what, without asking them for\npapers, without judging them, even when they are uninvited. All are to\nbe treated not as enemies who must be expelled or exterminated, but as\nfriends. Nevertheless, as Derrida constantly stresses, we cannot\nreally identify the friend as such. Unconditional hospitality is\ndangerous.\n\nThis danger explains why unconditional openness of the borders is not\nthe best (as opposed to what we were calling the worst above); it is\nonly the less bad or less evil, the less violence. Indeed, it looks as\nthough the unconditional opening is not possible. There always seems\nto be factual conditions. Among all the others we must decide, we must\nassign them papers, which means that there is always, still,\nnecessarily violence at the borders. At once, in hospitality, there is\nthe force that moves towards to the other to welcome and the force to\nremain unscathed and pulled back from the other, trying to keep the\ndoor closed. Here too, in hospitality, we see Derrida\u2019s idea of\na \u201cmessianicity without messiah.\u201d Because letting all the\nothers in is impossible (but we must note that Derrida\u2019s concept\nof possibility or virtuality, of the \u201cperhaps,\u201d is\ncomplicated; see in particular Politics of Friendship, p.\n29), this de-closing is always to come in the future like the messiah\ncoming or coming back (Derrida plays on the French word for the\nfuture, \u201cl\u2019avenir,\u201d which literally means \u201cto\ncome,\u201d \u201c\u00e0 venir\u201d). We must make one more\npoint. The impossibility of unconditional hospitality means that any\nattempt to open the globe completely is insufficient. Being\ninsufficient, every attempt therefore requires criticism; it must be\n\u201cdeconstructed,\u201d as Derrida would say. But this\ndeconstruction would be a deconstruction that recognizes its own\ninsufficiency. Deconstruction, to which we now turn, never therefore\nresults in good conscience, in the good conscience that comes with\nthinking we have done enough to render justice.\n5. Deconstruction\n\nAs we said at the beginning, \u201cdeconstruction\u201d is the most\nfamous of Derrida\u2019s terms. He seems to have appropriated the\nterm from Heidegger\u2019s use of \u201cdestruction\u201d in\nBeing and Time. But we can get a general sense of what\nDerrida means with deconstruction by recalling Descartes\u2019s First\nMeditation. There Descartes says that for a long time he has been\nmaking mistakes. The criticism of his former beliefs both mistaken and\nvalid aims towards uncovering a \u201cfirm and permanent\nfoundation.\u201d The image of a foundation implies that the\ncollection of his former beliefs resembles a building. In the First\nMeditation then, Descartes is in effect taking down this old building,\n\u201cde-constructing\u201d it. We have also seen how much Derrida\nis indebted to traditional transcendental philosophy which really\nstarts here with Descartes\u2019 search for a \u201cfirm and\npermanent foundation.\u201d But with Derrida, we know now, the\nfoundation is not a unified self but a divisible limit between myself\nand myself as an other (auto-affection as hetero-affection:\n\u201corigin-heterogeneous\u201d).\n\nDerrida has provided many definitions of deconstruction. But three\ndefinitions are classical. The first is early, being found in\nthe 1971 interview \u201cPositions\u201d and in the 1972 Preface to\nDissemination: deconstruction consists in \u201ctwo\nphases\u201d (Positions, pp. 41\u201342,\nDissemination, pp.4\u20136). At this stage of his career\nDerrida speaks of \u201cmetaphysics\u201d as if the Western\nphilosophical tradition was monolithic and homogeneous. At times he\nalso speaks of \u201cPlatonism,\u201d as Nietzsche did. Simply,\ndeconstruction is a criticism of Platonism, which is defined by the\nbelief that existence is structured in terms of oppositions (separate\nsubstances or forms) and that the oppositions are hierarchical, with\none side of the opposition being more valuable than the other. The\nfirst phase of deconstruction attacks this belief by\nreversing the Platonistic hierarchies: the hierarchies\nbetween the invisible or intelligible and the visible or sensible;\nbetween essence and appearance; between the soul and body; between\nliving memory and rote memory; between mn\u0113m\u0113 and\nhypomn\u0113sis; between voice and writing; between finally\ngood and evil. In order to clarify deconstruction\u2019s \u201ctwo\nphases,\u201d let us restrict ourselves to one specific opposition,\nthe opposition between appearance and essence. Prior to Derrida,\nNietzsche had also criticized this opposition, and it is criticized in\na lot of Twentieth Century philosophy. So, in Platonism, essence is\nmore valuable than appearance. In deconstruction however, we reverse\nthis, making appearance more valuable than essence. How? Here we could\nresort to empiricist arguments (in Hume for example) that show that\nall knowledge of what we call essence depends on the experience of\nwhat appears. But then, this argumentation would imply that essence\nand appearance are not related to one another as separate oppositional\npoles. The argumentation in other words would show us that essence can\nbe reduced down to a variation of appearances (involving the roles of\nmemory and anticipation). The reduction is a reduction to what we can\ncall \u201cimmanence,\u201d which carries the sense of\n\u201cwithin\u201d or \u201cin.\u201d So, we would say that what\nwe used to call essence is found in appearance, essence is\nmixed into appearance. Now, we can back track a bit in the\nhistory of Western metaphysics. On the basis of the reversal of the\nessence-appearance hierarchy and on the basis of the reduction to\nimmanence, we can see that something like a decision (a perhaps\nimpossible decision) must have been made at the beginning of the\nmetaphysical tradition, a decision that instituted the hierarchy of\nessence-appearance and separated essence from appearance. This\ndecision is what really defines Platonism or\n\u201cmetaphysics.\u201d After this retrospection, we can turn now\nto a second step in the reversal-reduction of Platonism, which is the\nsecond \u201cphase\u201d of deconstruction. The previously inferior\nterm must be re-inscribed as the \u201corigin\u201d or\n\u201cresource\u201d of the opposition and hierarchy itself. How\nwould this re-inscription or redefinition of appearance work? Here we\nwould have to return to the idea that every appearance or every\nexperience is temporal. In the experience of the present, there is\nalways a small difference between the moment of now-ness and the past\nand the future. (It is perhaps possible that Hume had already\ndiscovered this small difference when, in the Treatise, he\nspeaks of the idea of relation.) In any case, this infinitesimal\ndifference is not only a difference that is non-dualistic, but also it\nis a difference that is, as Derrida would say,\n\u201cundecidable.\u201d Although the minuscule difference is\nvirtually unnoticeable in everyday common experience, when we in fact\nnotice it, we cannot decide if we are experiencing a memory\nor a present perception, if we are experiencing a present perception\nor an anticipation. (Bergson makes a similar claim in his\n\u201cMemory of the Present and False Recognition\u201d\n[Mind-Energy, pp. 109\u2013151] and Deleuze extends\nBergson\u2019s insight in his \u201cThe Actual and the\nVirtual\u201d [Dialogues, pp. 148\u2013152].) When we\nnotice the difference, we are indeed experiencing the present, but the\npresent is recognized as \u201ccontaminated\u201d by the past and\nfuture. Insofar as the difference is undecidable (perception \u2013\nwhat we see right now \u2013 contaminated with memory or the present\ncontaminated with the past: the experienced difference is an\nexperience of what Derrida would call the \u201ctrace\u201d), the\ndifference destabilizes the original decision that instituted the\nhierarchy. After the redefinition of the previously inferior term,\nDerrida usually changes the term\u2019s orthography, for example,\nwriting \u201cdiff\u00e9rence\u201d with an \u201ca\u201d as\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d in order to indicate the\nchange in its status. Diff\u00e9rance (which is found in appearances\nwhen we recognize their temporal nature) then refers to the\nundecidable resource into which \u201cmetaphysics\u201d\n\u201ccut\u201d in order to makes its decision. In\n\u201cPositions,\u201d Derrida calls names like\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d \u201cold names\u201d or\n\u201cpaleonyms,\u201d and there he also provides a list of these\n\u201cold terms\u201d: \u201cpharmakon\u201d;\n\u201csupplement\u201d; \u201ctrace\u201d; \u201chymen\u201d;\n\u201cgram\u201d; \u201cspacing\u201d; and \u201cincision\u201d\n(Positions, p. 43). These names are old because, like the\nword \u201cappearance\u201d or the word \u201cdifference,\u201d\nthey have been used for centuries in the history of Western philosophy\nto refer to the inferior position in hierarchies. But now, they are\nbeing used to refer to the resource that has never had a name in\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d; they are being used to refer to the\nresource that is indeed \u201colder\u201d than the metaphysical\ndecision.\n\nThis first definition of deconstruction as two phases gives way to the\nrefinement we find in the \u201cForce of Law\u201d (which dates from\n1989\u20131990). This second definition is less metaphysical\nand more political. In \u201cForce of Law,\u201d Derrida says that\ndeconstruction is practiced in two styles (Deconstruction and the\nPossibility of Justice, p. 21). These \u201ctwo styles\u201d do\nnot correspond to the \u201ctwo phases\u201d in the earlier\ndefinition of deconstruction. On the one hand, there is the\ngenealogical style of deconstruction, which recalls the history of a\nconcept or theme. Earlier in his career, in Of Grammatology,\nDerrida had laid out, for example, the history of the concept of\nwriting. But now what is at issue is the history of justice. On the\nother hand, there is the more formalistic or structural style of\ndeconstruction, which examines a-historical paradoxes or aporias. In\n\u201cForce of Law,\u201d Derrida lays out three aporias, although\nthey all seem to be variants of one, an aporia concerning the unstable\nrelation between law (the French term is \u201cdroit,\u201d which\nalso means \u201cright\u201d) and justice.\n\nDerrida calls the first aporia, \u201cthe epoche of\nthe rule\u201d (Deconstruction and the Possibility of\nJustice, pp. 22\u201323). Our most common axiom in ethical or\npolitical thought is that to be just or unjust and to exercise\njustice, one must be free and responsible for one\u2019s actions and\ndecisions. Here Derrida in effect is asking: what is freedom. On the\none hand, freedom consists in following a rule; but in the case of\njustice, we would say that a judgment that simply followed the law was\nonly right, not just. For a decision to be just, not only must a judge\nfollow a rule but also he or she must \u201cre-institute\u201d it,\nin a new judgment. Thus a decision aiming at justice (a free decision)\nis both regulated and unregulated. The law must be conserved and also\ndestroyed or suspended, suspension being the meaning of the\nword \u201cepoche.\u201d Each case is other, each decision is\ndifferent and requires an absolutely unique interpretation which no\nexisting coded rule can or ought to guarantee. If a judge\nprogrammatically follows a code, he or she is a \u201ccalculating\nmachine.\u201d Strict calculation or arbitrariness, one or the other\nis unjust, but they are both involved; thus, in the present, we cannot\nsay that a judgment, a decision is just, purely just. For Derrida, the\n\u201cre-institution\u201d of the law in a unique decision is a kind\nof violence since it does not conform perfectly to the instituted\ncodes; the law is always, according to Derrida, founded in violence.\nThe violent re-institution of the law means that justice is\nimpossible. Derrida calls the second aporia \u201cthe ghost\nof the undecidable\u201d (Deconstruction and the Possibility of\nJustice, pp. 24\u201326). A decision begins with the initiative\nto read, to interpret, and even to calculate. But to make such a\ndecision, one must first of all experience what Derrida calls\n\u201cundecidability.\u201d One must experience that the case, being\nunique and singular, does not fit the established codes and therefore\na decision about it seems to be impossible. The undecidable, for\nDerrida, is not mere oscillation between two significations. It is the\nexperience of what, though foreign to the calculable and the rule, is\nstill obligated. We are obligated \u2013 this is a kind of\nduty\u2014to give oneself up to the impossible decision, while taking\naccount of rules and law. As Derrida says, \u201cA decision that did\nnot go through the ordeal of the undecidable would not be a free\ndecision, it would only be the programmable application or unfolding\nof a calculable process\u201d (Deconstruction and the Possibility\nof Justice, p. 24). And once the ordeal is past (\u201cif this\never happens,\u201d as Derrida says), then the decision has again\nfollowed or given itself a rule and is no longer presently just.\nJustice therefore is always to come in the future, it is never\npresent. There is apparently no moment during which a decision could\nbe called presently and fully just. Either it has not followed a rule,\nhence it is unjust; or it has followed a rule, which has no\nfoundation, which makes it again unjust; or if it did follow\na rule, it was calculated and again unjust since it did not\nrespect the singularity of the case. This relentless injustice is why\nthe ordeal of the undecidable is never past. It keeps coming back like\na \u201cphantom,\u201d which \u201cdeconstructs from the inside\nevery assurance of presence, and thus every criteriology that would\nassure us of the justice of the decision\u201d (Deconstruction\nand the Possibility of Justice, pp. 24\u201325). Even though\njustice is impossible and therefore always to come in or from the\nfuture, justice is not, for Derrida, a Kantian ideal, which brings us\nto the third aporia. The third is called \u201cthe urgency\nthat obstructs the horizon of knowledge\u201d (Deconstruction and\nthe Possibility of Justice, pp. 26\u201328). Derrida stresses\nthe Greek etymology of the word \u201chorizon\u201d: \u201cAs its\nGreek name suggests, a horizon is both the opening and limit that\ndefines an infinite progress or a period of waiting.\u201d Justice,\nhowever, even though it is un-presentable, does not wait. A just\ndecision is always required immediately. It cannot furnish itself with\nunlimited knowledge. The moment of decision itself remains a finite\nmoment of urgency and precipitation. The instant of decision is then\nthe moment of madness, acting in the night of non-knowledge and\nnon-rule. Once again we have a moment of irruptive violence. This\nurgency is why justice has no horizon of expectation (either\nregulative or messianic). Justice remains an event yet to come.\nPerhaps one must always say \u201ccan-be\u201d (the French word for\n\u201cperhaps\u201d is \u201cpeut-\u00eatre,\u201d which\nliterally means \u201ccan be\u201d) for justice. This ability for\njustice aims however towards what is impossible.\n\nEven later in Derrida\u2019s career he will formalize, beyond these\naporias, the nature of deconstruction. The third definition of\ndeconstruction can be found in an essay from 2000 called \u201cEt\nCetera.\u201d Here Derrida in fact presents the principle that\ndefines deconstruction:\n\nEach time that I say \u2018deconstruction and X (regardless of the\nconcept or the theme),\u2019 this is the prelude to a very singular\ndivision that turns this X into, or rather makes appear in this X,\nan impossibility that becomes its proper and sole\npossibility, with the result that between the X as possible and the\n\u2018same\u2019 X as impossible, there is nothing but a relation of\nhomonymy, a relation for which we have to provide an account\u2026.\nFor example, here referring myself to demonstrations I have already\nattempted \u2026, gift, hospitality, death itself (and therefore so\nmany other things) can be possible only as impossible, as the\nim-possible, that is, unconditionally (Deconstructions: a\nUser\u2019s Guide, p. 300, my emphasis).\n\n\nEven though the word \u201cdeconstruction\u201d has been bandied\nabout, we can see now the kind of thinking in which deconstruction\nengages. It is a kind of thinking that never finds itself at the end.\nJustice \u2013 this is undeniable \u2013 is impossible (perhaps\njustice is the \u201cimpossible\u201d) and therefore it is necessary\nto make justice possible in countless ways.\n\nFinally, with the publication of the death penalty lectures, we have\nanother definition of deconstruct, one also dating from 2000 (lecture\ndated March 1/8, 2000). Here is what Derrida says:\n\nTo deconstruct death, then, that is the subject, while recalling that\nwe do not know what it is, if and when it happens, and to whom. ...\nThe dream of deconstruction, a convulsive movement to have done with\ndeath itself. Not to put into question again the question, what is\ndeath? when and where does it take place? etc. What comes afterward?\nand so forth. But to deconstruct death. Final period. And with the\nsame blow, to come to blows with death and put it out of action. No\nless than that. Death to death (The Death Penalty (Volume 1),\npp. 240\u2013241).\n\n\n\u201cNo less than that. Death to death\u201d: This shows us that\nperhaps even more than justice deconstruction values (if we can speak\nof a moral value) life more than anything else. But, this life is not\nunscathed; it is life in its irreducible connection to death. Thus\nwhat deconstruction values is survival.\n",
