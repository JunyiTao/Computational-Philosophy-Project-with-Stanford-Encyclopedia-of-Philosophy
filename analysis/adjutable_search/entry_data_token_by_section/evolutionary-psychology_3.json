Most of\nthese critics are philosophers of biology who argue that the research\ntradition suffers from an overly zealous form of\n adaptationism\n (Griffiths 1996; Richardson 1996; Grantham and Nichols 1999; Lloyd\n1999; Richardson 2007), an untenable reductionism (Dupre 1999; Dupre\n2001), a \u201cbad empirical bet\u201d about modules (Sterelny 1995;\nSterelny and Griffiths 1999; Sterelny 2003), a fast and loose\nconception of fitness (Lloyd 1999; Lloyd and Feldman 2002); and most\nof the above and much more (Buller 2005) (cf. Downes\n 2005).[6]\n All of these philosophers share one version or other of\nBuller\u2019s view: \u201cI am unabashedly enthusiastic about\nefforts to apply evolutionary theory to human psychology\u201d (2005,\n x).[7]\n But if philosophers of biology are not skeptical of the fundamental\nidea behind the project, as Buller\u2019s quote indicates, what are\nthey so critical of? What is at stake are differing views about how to\nbest characterize evolution and hence how to generate evolutionary\nhypotheses and how to test evolutionary hypotheses. For evolutionary\npsychologists, the most interesting contribution that evolutionary\ntheory makes is the explanation of apparent design in nature or the\nexplanation of the production of complex organs by appeal to natural\nselection. Evolutionary psychologists generate evolutionary hypotheses\nby first finding apparent design in the world, say in our\npsychological make up, and then presenting a selective scenario that\nwould have led to the production of the trait that exhibits apparent\ndesign. The hypotheses evolutionary psychologists generate, given that\nthey are usually hypotheses about our psychological capacities, are\ntested by standard psychological methods. Philosophers of biology\nchallenge evolutionary psychologists on both of these points. I\nintroduce a few examples of criticisms in each of these two areas\nbelow and then look at some responses to philosophical criticisms of\nevolutionary psychology.\n\nAdaptation is the one biological concept that is central to most\ndebates over evolutionary psychology. Every theoretical work on\nevolutionary psychology presents the research tradition as being\nprimarily focused on psychological adaptations and goes on to give an\naccount of what adaptations are (see e.g. Tooby and Cosmides 1992;\nBuss et al. 1998; Simpson and Campbell 2005; Tooby and Cosmides 2005).\nMuch of the philosophical criticism of evolutionary psychology\naddresses its approach to adaptation or its form of adaptationism. Let\nus quickly review the basics from the perspective of philosophy of\nbiology.\n\nHere is how Elliott Sober defines an adaptation: \u201ccharacteristic\nc is an adaptation for doing task t in a population\nif and only if members of the population now have c because,\nancestrally, there was selection for having c and c\nconferred a fitness advantage because it performed task\nt\u201d (Sober 2000, 85). Sober makes a few further\nclarifications of the notion of adaptation that are helpful. First, we\nshould distinguish between a trait that is adaptive and a\ntrait that is an adaptation. Any number of traits can be\nadaptive without those traits being adaptations. A sea turtle\u2019s\nforelegs are useful for digging in the sand to bury eggs but they are\nnot adaptations for nest building (Sober 2000, 85). Also, traits can\nbe adaptations without being currently adaptive for a given organism.\nVestigial organs such as our appendix or vestigial eyes in cave\ndwelling organisms are examples of such traits (Sterelny and Griffiths\n1999). Second, we should distinguish between ontogenic and\nphylogenetic adaptations (Sober 2000, 86). The adaptations of interest\nto evolutionary biologists are phylogenetic adaptations, which arise\nover evolutionary time and impact the fitness of the organism.\nOntogenetic adaptations, including any behavior we learn in our\nlifetimes, can be adaptive to the extent that an organism benefits\nfrom them but they are not adaptations in the relevant sense. Finally,\nadaptation and function are closely related terms. On one of the\nprominent views of function\u2014the etiological view of\nfunctions\u2014adaptation and function are more or less coextensive;\nto ask for the function of an organ is to ask why it is present. On\nthe Cummins view of functions adaptation and function are not\ncoextensive, as on the Cummins view, to ask what an organ\u2019s\nfunction is, is to ask what it does (Sober 2000, 86\u201387) (cf.\nSterelny and Griffiths 1999, 220\u2013224).\n\nEvolutionary psychologists focus on psychological adaptations. One\nconsistent theme in the theoretical work of evolutionary psychologists\nis that \u201cadaptations, the functional components of organisms,\nare identified [\u2026] by [\u2026] evidence of their design: the\nexquisite match between organism structure and environment\u201d\n(Hagen 2005, 148). The way in which psychological adaptations are\nidentified is by evolutionary functional analysis, which is a type of\nreverse\n engineering.[8]\n \u201cReverse engineering is a process of figuring out the design of\na mechanism on the basis of an analysis of the tasks it performs.\nEvolutionary functional analysis is a form of reverse engineering in\nthat it attempts to reconstruct the mind\u2019s design from an\nanalysis of the problems the mind must have evolved to solve\u201d\n(Buller 2005, 92). Many philosophers object to evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019 over attribution of adaptations on the basis of\napparent design. Here some are following Gould and Lewontin\u2019s\n(1979) lead when they worry that accounting for apparent design in\nnature in terms of adaptation amounts to telling just-so stories but\nthey could just as easily cite Williams (1966), who also cautioned\nagainst the over attribution of adaptation as an explanation for\nbiological traits. While it is true that evolutionary functional\nanalysis can lend itself to just-so story telling, this is not the\nmost interesting problem that confronts evolutionary psychology,\nseveral other interesting problems have been identified. For example,\nElisabeth Lloyd (1999) derives a criticism of evolutionary psychology\nfrom Gould and Lewontin\u2019s criticism of sociobiology, emphasizing\nthe point that evolutionary psychologists\u2019 adaptationism leads\nthem to ignore alternative evolutionary processes. Buller takes yet\nanother approach to evolutionary psychologists\u2019 adaptationism.\nWhat lies behind Buller\u2019s criticisms of evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019 adaptationism is a different view than theirs\nabout what is important in evolutionary thinking (Buller 2005). Buller\nthinks that evolutionary psychologists overemphasize design and that\nthey make the contentious assumption that with respect to the traits\nthey are interested in, evolution is finished, rather than\nongoing.\n\nSober\u2019s definition of adaptation is not constrained only to\napply to organs or other traits that exhibit apparent design. Rather,\nclutch size (in birds), schooling (in fish), leaf arrangement,\nforaging strategies and all manner of traits can be adaptations (cf.\nSeger and Stubblefield 1996). Buller argues the more general point\nthat phenotypic plasticity of various types can be an adaptation,\nbecause it arises in various organisms as a result of natural\n selection.[9]\n The difference here between Buller (and other philosophers and\nbiologists) and evolutionary psychologists is a difference in the\nexplanatory scope that they attribute to natural selection. For\nevolutionary psychologists, the hallmark of natural selection is a\nwell functioning organ and for their critics, the results of natural\nselection can be seen in an enormous range of traits ranging from the\nspecific apparent design features of organs to the most general\nresponse profiles in behavior. According to Buller, this latter\napproach opens up the range of possible evolutionary hypotheses that\ncan account for human behavior. Rather than being restricted to\naccounting for our behavior in terms of the joint output of many\nspecific modular mechanisms, we can account for our behavior by\nappealing to selection acting upon many different levels of traits.\nThis difference in emphasis on what is important in evolutionary\ntheory also is at the center of debates between evolutionary\npsychologists and behavioral ecologists, who argue that behaviors,\nrather than just the mechanisms that underlie them, can be adaptations\n(cf. Downes 2001). Further, this difference in emphasis is what leads\nto the wide range of alternate evolutionary hypotheses that Sterelny\n(Sterelny 2003) presents to explain human behavior. Given that\nphilosophers like Buller and Sterelny are adaptationists, they are not\ncritical of evolutionary psychologists\u2019 adaptationism. Rather,\nthey are critical of the narrow explanatory scope of the type of\nadaptationism evolutionary psychologists adopt (cf. Downes 2015).\n\nBuller\u2019s criticism that evolutionary psychologists assume that\nevolution is finished for the traits that they are interested in\nconnects worries about the understanding of evolutionary theory with\nworries about the testing of evolutionary hypotheses. Here is Tooby\n& Cosmides\u2019 clear statement of the assumption that Buller is\nworried about: \u201cevolutionary psychologists primarily explore the\ndesign of the universal, evolved psychological and neural architecture\nthat we all share by virtue of being human. Evolutionary psychologists\nare usually less interested in human characteristics that vary due to\ngenetic differences because they recognize that these differences are\nunlikely to be evolved adaptations central to human nature. Of the\nthree kinds of characteristics that are found in the design of\norganisms \u2013 adaptations, by-products, and noise \u2013 traits\ncaused by genetic variants are predominantly evolutionary noise, with\nlittle adaptive significance, while complex adaptations are likely to\nbe universal in the species\u201d (Tooby and Cosmides 2005, 39). This\nline of thinking also captures evolutionary psychologists\u2019 view\nof human nature: human nature is our collection of universally shared\nadaptations. (See Downes and Machery 2013 for more discussion of this\nand other, contrasting biologically based accounts of human nature.)\nThe problem here is that it is false to assume that adaptations cannot\nbe subject to variation. The underlying problem is the constrained\nnotion of adaptation. Adaptations are traits that arise as a result of\nnatural selection and not traits that exhibit design and are universal\nin a given species (cf. Seger and Stubblefield 1996). As a result, it\nis quite consistent to argue, as Buller does, that many human traits\nmay still be under selection and yet reasonably be called adaptations.\nFinally, philosophers of biology have articulated several different\ntypes of adaptationism (see e.g. Godfrey-Smith 2001; Lewens 2009;\nSober 2000). While some of these types of adaptationism can be\nreasonably seen placing constraints on how evolutionary research is\ncarried out, Godfrey-Smith\u2019s \u201cexplanatory\nadaptationism\u201d is different in character (Godfrey-Smith 2001).\nExplanatory adaptationism is the view that apparent design is one of\nthe big questions we face in explaining our natural world and natural\nselection is the big (and only supportable) answer to such a big\nquestion. Explanatory adaptationism is often adopted by those who want\nto distinguish evolutionary thinking from creationism or intelligent\ndesign and is the way evolutionary psychologists often couch their\nwork to distinguish it from their colleagues in the broader social\nsciences. While explanatory adaptationism does serve to distinguish\nevolutionary psychology from such markedly different approaches to\naccounting for design in nature, it does not place many clear\nconstraints on the way in which evolutionary explanations should be\nsought (cf. Downes 2015). So far these are disagreements that are\nlocated in differing views about the nature and scope of evolutionary\nexplanation but they have ramifications in the discussion about\nhypothesis testing.\n\nIf the traits of interest to evolutionary psychologists are\nuniversally distributed, then we should expect to find them in all\nhumans. This partly explains the stock that evolutionary psychologists\nput in cross cultural psychological tests (see e.g. Buss 1990). If we\nfind evidence for the trait in a huge cross section of humans, then\nthis supports our view that the trait is an adaptation \u2014on the\nassumption that adaptations are organ-like traits that are products of\nnatural selection but not subject to variation. But given the wider\nscope view of evolution defended by philosophers of biology, this\nmethod of testing seems wrong-headed as a test of an evolutionary\nhypothesis. Certainly such testing can result in the very interesting\nresults that certain preference profiles are widely shared cross\nculturally but the test does not speak to the evolutionary hypothesis\nthat the preferences are adaptations (cf. Lloyd 1999; Buller\n2005).\n\nAnother worry that critics have about evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019 approach to hypothesis testing is that they give\ninsufficient weight to serious alternate hypotheses that fit the\nrelevant data. Buller dedicates several chapters of his book on\nevolutionary psychology to an examination of hypothesis testing and\nmany of his criticisms center around the introduction of alternate\nhypotheses that do as good a job, or a better job, of accounting for\nthe data. For example, he argues that the hypothesis of assortative\nmating by status does a better job of accounting for some of\nevolutionary psychologists\u2019 mate selection data than their\npreferred high status preference hypothesis. This debate hangs on how\nthe empirical tests come out. The previous debate is more closely\nconnected to theoretical issues in philosophy of biology.\n\nI said in my introduction that there is a broad consensus among\nphilosophers of science that evolutionary psychology is a deeply\nflawed enterprise and some philosophers of biology continue to remind\nus of this sentiment (see e.g. Dupre 2012). However the relevant\nconsensus is not complete, there are some proponents of evolutionary\npsychology among philosophers of science. One way of defending\nevolutionary psychology is to rebut criticism. Edouard Machery and\nClark Barrett (2007) do just that in their sharply critical review of\nBuller\u2019s book. Another way to defend evolutionary psychology is\nto practice it (at least to the extent that philosophers can, i.e.\ntheoretically). This is what Robert Arp (2006) does in a recent\narticle. I briefly review both responses below.\n\nMachery and Barrett (2007) argue that Buller has no clear critical\ntarget as there is nothing to the idea that there is a research\ntradition of evolutionary psychology that is distinct from the broader\nenterprise of the evolutionary understanding of human behavior. They\nargue that theoretical tenets and methods are shared by many in the\nbiology of human behavior. For example, many are adaptationists. But\nas we saw above, evolutionary psychologists and behavioral ecologists\ncan both call themselves adaptationist but their particular approach\nto adaptationism dictates the range of hypotheses that they can\ngenerate, the range of traits that can be counted as adaptations and\nimpacts upon the way in which hypotheses are tested. Research\ntraditions can share some broad theoretical commitments and yet still\nbe distinct research traditions. Secondly, they argue against\nBuller\u2019s view that past environments are not stable enough to\nproduce the kind of psychological adaptations that evolutionary\npsychologists propose. They take this to be a claim that no\nadaptations can arise from an evolutionary arms race situation, for\nexample, between predators and prey. But again, I think that the\ndisagreement here is over what counts as an adaptation. Buller does\nnot deny that adaptations\u2014 traits that arise as a product of\nnatural selection\u2014arise from all kinds of unstable environments.\nWhat he denies is that organ-like, special purpose adaptations are the\nlikely result of such evolutionary scenarios. \n\nArp (2006) defends a hypothesis about a kind of module\u2014scenario\nvisualization\u2014a psychological adaptation that arose in our\nhominid history in response to the demands of tool making, such as\nconstructing spear throwing devices for hunting. Arp presents his\nhypothesis in the context of demonstrating the superiority of his\napproach to evolutionary psychology, which he calls \u201cNarrow\nEvolutionary Psychology,\u201d over \u201cBroad Evolutionary\nPsychology,\u201d with respect to accounting for archaeological\nevidence and facts about our psychology. While Arp\u2019s hypothesis\nis innovative and interesting, he by no means defends it conclusively.\nThis is partly because his strategy is to compare his hypothesis with\narchaeologist Steven Mithen\u2019s (see e.g. 1996) non-modular\n\u201ccognitive fluidity\u201d hypothesis that is proposed to\naccount for the same data. The problem here is that Mithen\u2019s\nview is only one of the many alternative, evolutionary explanations of\nhuman tool making behavior. While Arp\u2019s modular thesis may be\nsuperior to Mithen\u2019s, he has not compared it to Sterelny\u2019s\n(2003; 2012) account of tool making and tool use or to Boyd and\nRicherson\u2019s (see e.g. 2005) account and hence not ruled these\naccounts out as plausible alternatives. As neither of these\nalternative accounts rely on the postulation of psychological modules,\nevolutionary psychology is not adequately defended.\n",
