    "main_text": "Objections || The Incompleteness Objection\n6.1 The Incompleteness Objection\n\nMany critics of public justification claim it cannot address critical\npolitical issues. This problem arises from restrictions on permissible\nreasoning in public life. (De Marneffe 1994, Reidy 2000; Schwartzman\n2004). Critics here object to consensus views, which restrict the set\nof justifying reasons. Citizens may not have shared reasons and\ninstead appeal to personal considerations, so the convergence view\nmakes this objection less pressing.\n",
