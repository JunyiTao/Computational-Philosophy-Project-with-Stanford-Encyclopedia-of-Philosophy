While precise measurement is achievable in the\nbiochemistry lab, the practical and philosophical challenges are\nthornier when doing measurement at the level of the whole person or\nthe population. What is well-being (Alexandrova 2017)? By\nwhat standards can we call a population healthy (Hausman 2015)? What\nsorts of social structures, policies, and interventions are effective\nfor promoting health (Valles 2018)? How do we identify which subgroups\nare left out of the benefits and prevent injustices being done to them\n(Maglo 2010, 2012)? What sorts of values are at stake when we debate\nbiomedical evidence surrounding culturally issues such as birthing\npractices (McClimans 2017)? A common theme shared by these critiques\nis a concern about the fickleness and contingency of measurement\nleaving much room for practitioners\u2019 values and motivations to\nshape the results of the measurement process, for good or for ill.\n\nThe biomedical quest for precise and objective measurements leaves\nsome unsatisfied with the little room left for patient input in\nclinical care decision-making. What roles are there for patient input\nin the process of deciding the best course of treatment (Chin-Yee\n& Upshur, 2018)? According to critiques, by trying to sideline\nsubjective factors in medical care and replace them with increasingly\nobjective factors, EBM especially (even among than other biomedical\nperspectives), risks losing the humanistic aspects of medicine, an\nethical loss and an epistemic loss. By treating patients\u2019\ndesires, goals, and values as largely irrelevant or a source of\ninterference with an objective process, EBM loses sight of medicine as\na means of helping real humans\u2019 real problems. Relatedly, by\nshutting the patient out of the process, the notion of the best or\nright treatment becomes hollowed out (McClimans forthcoming).\n\nIn the background is the important\u2014and\nmeta-epistemic\u2014problem that physicians are not educated to be\ncomfortable with uncertainty, and what to do in an objective\nmeasurement-focused field when one finds oneself lacking the desired\nevidence: inconclusive tests, treatments designed for patients unlike\nthe one being treated, etc. The very topic of uncertainty is\nconspicuously absent from medical education (Tonelli & Upshur\n2019).\n",
