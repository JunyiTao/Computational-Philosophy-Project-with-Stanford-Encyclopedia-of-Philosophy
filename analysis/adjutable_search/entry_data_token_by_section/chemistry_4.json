    "main_text": "Substances, Elements, and Chemical Combination || Complications for the Periodic System\n1.4 Complications for the Periodic System\n\nMendeleev\u2019s periodic system was briefly called into question with the\ndiscovery of the inert gas argon in 1894, which had to be placed\noutside the existing system after chlorine. But William Ramsay\n(1852\u20131916) suspected there might be a whole group of chemically\ninert substances separating the electronegative halogen group 17 (to\nwhich chlorine belongs) and the electropositive alkali metals, and by\n1898 he had discovered the other noble gases, which became group 18 on\nthe modern Table.\n\nA more serious challenge arose when the English radiochemist Frederick\nSoddy (1877\u20131956) established in 1913 that according to the\natomic weight criterion of sameness, positions in the periodic table\nwere occupied by several elements. Adopting Margaret Todd\u2019s\n(1859\u20131918) suggestion, Soddy called these elements\n\u2018isotopes,\u2019 meaning \u201csame place.\u201d At the same\ntime, Bohr\u2019s conception of the atom as comprising a positively charged\nnucleus around which much lighter electrons circulated was gaining\nacceptance. After some discussion about criteria (van der Vet 1979),\ndelegates to the 1923 IUPAC meeting saved the Periodic Table by\ndecreeing that positions should be correlated with atomic number\n(number of protons in the nucleus) rather than atomic weight.\n\nCorrelating positions in the Periodic Table with whole numbers finally\nprovided a criterion determining whether any gaps remained in the\ntable below the position corresponding to the highest known atomic\nnumber. The variation in atomic weight for fixed atomic number was\nexplained in 1932 when James Chadwick (1891\u20131974) discovered the\nneutron\u2014a neutral particle occurring alongside the proton in\natomic nuclei with approximately the same mass as the proton.\n\nContemporary philosophical discussion about the nature of the elements\nbegins with the work of Friedrich Paneth (1887\u20131958), whose work\nheavily influenced IUPAC standards and definitions. He was among the\nfirst chemists in modern times to make explicit the distinction\nbetween the last point of analysis and actual components analyses, and\nargued that the last point in analysis thesis could not be the proper\nbasis for the chemical explanation of the nature of compounds.\nSomething that wasn\u2019t actually present in a substance couldn\u2019t be\ninvoked to explain the properties in a real substance. He went on to\nsay that the chemically important notion of element was\n\u201ctranscendental,\u201d which we interpret to mean \u201can\nabstraction over the properties in compounds\u201d (Paneth\n1962).\n\nAnother strand of the philosophical discussion probes at the\ncontemporary IUPAC definition of elements. According to IUPAC, to be\ngold is to have atomic number 79, regardless of atomic weight. A\nlogical and intended consequence of this definition is that all\nisotopes sharing an atomic number count as the same element. Needham\n(2008) has recently challenged this identification by pointing to\nchemically salient differences among the isotopes. These differences\nare best illustrated by the three isotopes of hydrogen: protium,\ndeuterium and tritium. The most striking chemical difference among the\nisotopes of hydrogen is their different rate of chemical reactions.\nBecause of the sensitivity of biochemical processes to rates of\nreaction, heavy water (deuterium oxide) is poisonous whereas ordinary\nwater (principally protium oxide) is not. With the development of more\nsensitive measuring techniques, it has become clear that this is a\ngeneral phenomenon. Isotopic variation affects the rate of chemical\nreactions, although these effects are less marked with increasing\natomic number. In view of the way chemists understand these\ndifferences in behavior, Needham argues that they can reasonably be\nsaid to underlie differences in chemical substance. He further argues\nthat the criteria of sameness and difference provided by\nthermodynamics also suggest that the isotopes should be considered\ndifferent substances. However, notwithstanding his own view, the\nplaces in Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table were determined by atomic number\n(or nuclear charge), so a concentration on atomic weight would be\nhighly revisionary of chemical classification (Hendry 2006a). It can\nalso be argued that the thermodynamic criteria underlying the view\nthat isotopes are different substances distinguish among substances\nmore finely than is appropriate for chemistry (Hendry 2010c).\n",
