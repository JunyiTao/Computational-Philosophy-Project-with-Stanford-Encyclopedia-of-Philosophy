This\nserves to correct for inequalities in the commonly adopted standard of\ntime, the solar day, which most people mistakenly believe\nto be uniform. The solar day, defined as the period of time it takes\nthe sun to return to zenith, varies by as much as 20 minutes over the\ncourse of a year. The standard of correction in the equation of time\nused in Ptolemaic astronomy was based upon the assumption that the\nsidereal day\u2014the period of time it takes a fixed star to return\nto zenith\u2014is constant, because the celestial sphere on which\nthe fixed stars are located should not be assumed to speed up and slow\ndown. With the demise of the Ptolemaic system and Aristotelian\ncosmology, this rationale was no longer compelling, and at least some\nastronomers, most notably Kepler, called into doubt whether the rate of\nrotation of the earth remained constant over the course of the\nyear. (Kepler considered that its rotation would be faster when closer\nto the sun due to an excitatory effect of the sun.) Thus, the issue of\nthe correct measure of time occupied considerable attention in 17th\nCentury astronomy, especially because the ability to measure the rate\nof rotation of the earth is equivalent to the problem of determining\nlongitude, which, for sea-faring nations, was critical for navigation\n(and hence military and economic dominance). Huygens' pendulum clock\nprovided the first terrestrial candidate for a decently accurate\nmeasure of uniform time. Newton mentions this, as well as the eclipses\nof the moons of Jupiter, an alternative method based on Kepler's\nperiod law.  \n\n The invocation of the need for an equation of time in astronomy is\nnot just an appeal to a well entrenched scientific practice. In the\ncourse of his discussion, Newton explains why he thinks the need is\njustified. Although he will argue in Book\nIII of the Principia that the diurnal rotation of the earth\nis  uniform, this is a contingent fact. It could have been otherwise.\nIndeed, it could have been that there are\nno uniform motions to serve as accurate measures of\ntime. The reason is that all motion is subject to being accelerated or\nretarded (by the application of external forces). In contrast,\nabsolute time (which is nothing other than duration or the\nperseverance of the existence of things) remains the same, whether the\nmotions be be swift, slow, or null.  \n",
