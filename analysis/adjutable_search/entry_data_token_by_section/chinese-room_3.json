    "main_text": "Historical Background || The Chinese Nation\n2.3 The Chinese Nation\n\nA fourth antecedent to the Chinese Room argument are thought\nexperiments involving myriad humans acting as a computer. In 1961\nAnatoly Mickevich (pseudonym A. Dneprov) published \u201cThe\nGame\u201d, a story in which a stadium full of 1400 math students are\narranged to function as a digital computer (see Dneprov 1961 and the\nEnglish translation listed at Mickevich 1961, Other Internet\nResources). For 4 hours each repeatedly does a bit of calculation on\nbinary numbers received from someone near them, then passes the binary\nresult onto someone nearby. They learn the next day that they\ncollectively translated a sentence from Portuguese into their native\nRussian. Mickevich\u2019s protagonist concludes \u201cWe\u2019ve\nproven that even the most perfect simulation of machine thinking is\nnot the thinking process itself, which is a higher form of motion of\nliving matter.\u201d Apparently independently, a similar\nconsideration emerged in early discussion of functionalist theories of\nminds and cognition (see further discussion in section 5.3 below),\nFunctionalists hold that mental states are defined by the causal role\nthey play in a system (just as a door stop is defined by what it does,\nnot by what it is made out of). Critics of functionalism were quick to\nturn its proclaimed virtue of multiple realizability against it. While\nfunctionalism was consistent with a materialist or biological\nunderstanding of mental states (arguably a virtue), it did not\nidentify types of mental states (such as experiencing pain, or\nwondering about OZ) with particular types of neurophysiological\nstates, as \u201ctype-type identity theory\u201d did. In contrast\nwith type-type identity theory, functionalism allowed sentient beings\nwith different physiology to have the same types of mental states as\nhumans \u2013 pains, for example. But it was pointed out that if\nextraterrestrial aliens, with some other complex system in place of\nbrains, could realize the functional properties that constituted\nmental states, then, presumably so could systems even less like human\nbrains. The computational form of functionalism, which holds that the\ndefining role of each mental state is its role in information\nprocessing or computation, is particularly vulnerable to this\nmaneuver, since a wide variety of systems with simple components are\ncomputationally equivalent (see e.g., Maudlin 1989 for discussion of a\ncomputer built from buckets of water). Critics asked if it was really\nplausible that these inorganic systems could have mental states or\nfeel pain.\n\nDaniel Dennett (1978) reports that in 1974 Lawrence Davis gave a\ncolloquium at MIT in which he presented one such unorthodox\nimplementation. Dennett summarizes Davis\u2019 thought experiment as\nfollows:\n\nLet a functionalist theory of pain (whatever its details) be\ninstantiated by a system the subassemblies of which are not such\nthings as C-fibers and reticular systems but telephone lines and\noffices staffed by people. Perhaps it is a giant robot controlled by\nan army of human beings that inhabit it. When the theory\u2019s\nfunctionally characterized conditions for pain are now met we must\nsay, if the theory is true, that the robot is in pain. That is, real\npain, as real as our own, would exist in virtue of the perhaps\ndisinterested and businesslike activities of these bureaucratic teams,\nexecuting their proper functions.\n\n\nIn \u201cTroubles with Functionalism\u201d, also published in 1978,\nNed Block envisions the entire population of China implementing the\nfunctions of neurons in the brain. This scenario has subsequently been\ncalled \u201cThe Chinese Nation\u201d or \u201cThe Chinese\nGym\u201d. We can suppose that every Chinese citizen would be given a\ncall-list of phone numbers, and at a preset time on implementation\nday, designated \u201cinput\u201d citizens would initiate the\nprocess by calling those on their call-list. When any citizen\u2019s\nphone rang, he or she would then phone those on his or her list, who\nwould in turn contact yet others. No phone message need be exchanged;\nall that is required is the pattern of calling. The call-lists would\nbe constructed in such a way that the patterns of calls implemented\nthe same patterns of activation that occur between neurons in\nsomeone\u2019s brain when that person is in a mental state \u2013\npain, for example. The phone calls play the same functional role as\nneurons causing one another to fire. Block was primarily interested in\nqualia, and in particular, whether it is plausible to hold that the\npopulation of China might collectively be in pain, while no individual\nmember of the population experienced any pain, but the thought\nexperiment applies to any mental states and operations, including\nunderstanding language.\n\nThus Block\u2019s precursor thought experiment, as with those of\nDavis and Dennett, is a system of many humans rather than one. The\nfocus is on consciousness, but to the extent that Searle\u2019s\nargument also involves consciousness, the thought experiment is\nclosely related to Searle\u2019s. Cole (1984) tries to pump\nintuitions in the reverse direction by setting out a thought\nexperiment in which each of his neurons is itself conscious, and fully\naware of its actions including being doused with neurotransmitters,\nundergoing action potentials, and squirting neurotransmitters at its\nneighbors. Cole argues that his conscious neurons would find it\nimplausible that their collective activity produced a consciousness\nand other cognitive competences, including understanding English, that\nthe neurons lack. Cole suggests the intuitions of implementing systems\nare not to be trusted. \n",
