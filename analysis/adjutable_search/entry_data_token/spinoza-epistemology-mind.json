Guiding commitments\n1.1 Universal intelligibility\n\nOne of Spinoza\u2019s most fundamental epistemological and\nmethodological commitments is a commitment to universal\nintelligibility. In his most influential treatise, the\nEthics, Spinoza expresses this commitment in two ways: first,\nas the axiom that there is nothing that cannot be\n\u201cconceived\u201d, either \u201cthrough itself\u201d or\nthrough \u201canother thing\u201d (Ethics [=\nE] 1ax2); second, as the claim that there is a\n\u201creason or [i.e.] cause\u201d for the \u201cexistence\nor nonexistence\u201d of every thing (E1p11atld1).\n\nThese formulations immediately raise several questions. What does it\nmean for something to be conceived \u201cthrough itself\u201d, i.e.,\nin some sense be self-explanatory? Does the equivalence of\ncauses and reasons suggested by E1p11altd1 mean that only appeals to\ncauses can furnish reasons? Indeed, what counts as a\n\u201creason\u201d (cf. Lin 2018)? It\u2019s often assumed that in\nSpinoza\u2019s view to give a \u201creason\u201d for something\nrequires engaging in the sort of apriori deductions that fill large\nswathes of the Ethics. The opening definition of the\ntreatise, according to which something is a \u201ccause of\nitself\u201d if its existence is implied by its essence (E1def1),\nsuggests that at least some of the relevant \u201creasons\u201d will\nindeed be accessible apriori. But could sense experience also furnish\nus with reasons? Is seeing my dog play with a stick enough of a\n\u201creason\u201d to \u201cconceive\u201d of her as existing, or\nmust I deduce her necessary existence from the infinitely long series\nof prior causes (E1p28), a task Spinoza admits is impossible for\nfinite minds like ours (Treatise on the Emendation of the\nIntellect [= TIE] \u00a7100)?\n\nControversially but influentially, Michael Della Rocca 2008 has argued\nthat Spinoza\u2019s philosophy as a whole can be derived from his\ncommitment to intelligibility. (For criticisms see e.g. Laerke 2011,\nNewlands 2018, Renz 2018.)\n1.2 Attribute barrier\n\nA second guiding but unintuitive commitment of Spinoza\u2019s\nepistemology has come to be known as the \u201cattribute\nbarrier\u201d. A Spinozistic \u201cattribute\u201d is a descendant\nof the Cartesian \u201cprincipal attribute\u201d (AT 8a.25):\nroughly, it is the most basic qualitative kind under which something\ncan fall. For example, to say that something is a mental thing or a\nphysical thing \u2013 or, in Spinoza\u2019s and Descartes\u2019s\nterminology, \u201cthinking\u201d or \u201cextended\u201d \u2013\nis to understand it in terms of its particular\n\u201cattribute\u201d.\n\nMost commentators take Spinoza to uphold a total explanatory\nclosure of mental and physical realms: pace Descartes, no\nphysical thing can enter into conceptual or explanatory relations with\nanything mental, and vice versa. For example, regardless of how we\nmight experience things, no physical occurrence, such as shaking a\nfist at someone, can be made intelligible by appealing to anything\nmental, like a menacing intention. Analogously, no bodily injury can\nmake intelligible the feeling of pain.\n\nThis prohibition on any \u201cexplanatory flow\u201d (Bennett 1984)\nbetween mental and physical realms is the core meaning of\nSpinoza\u2019s attribute barrier doctrine. Given Spinoza\u2019s\ncommitment to universal intelligibility (see 1.1), derivatively, the\nimpossibility of conceptual relations between minds and bodies implies\nthe impossibility of causal relations between them (E3p2s).\nFor if something is in principle unintelligible (as any purported\ncausal relation between minds and bodies would be), it is also\nmetaphysically impossible. This prohibition on causal interactions\nbetween mental and physical things is the key secondary meaning of the\nbarrier doctrine.\n\nGiven that ordinarily we do appeal to intentions in\nexplaining our physical actions and to bodily states in explaining\nsensations, what would lead Spinoza to such a prima facie implausible\ndoctrine? The reason ultimately has to do with how Spinoza understands\nthe nature of the most fundamental entity in his metaphysics,\n\u201csubstance\u201d. Building on philosophical tradition that goes\nback to Aristotle, Spinoza associates being a \u201csubstance\u201d\nwith existential and explanatory self-sufficiency or independence\n(E1def3). Each essential quality or \u201cattribute\u201d of\nsubstance also must, Spinoza believes, manifest this independence\nproper to substance: \u201cEach attribute of a substance must be\nconceived through itself\u201d (E1p10). As a result, we cannot look\nfor an explanation of the fact that substance thinks, or of how it\nthinks, anywhere else but in substance\u2019s thinking nature (for\nexample, we cannot appeal to the fact that it is also a material\nthing, i.e., a substance with the attribute of\n\u201cextension\u201d). In this sense substance as thinking is\n\u201cconceived through itself\u201d. The same reasoning will be\ntrue of any other substantial attribute.\n\nThis gives us the basic application of the barrier doctrine: the fact\nthat God is a physical thing cannot explain God\u2019s nature as a\nthinking thing; nor is explanation possible in the other direction.\nBut the barrier doctrine also extends to creaturely\nintentions, sensations, and movements. Ontologically, all the things\nfamiliar to us from ordinary experience \u2013 animals, plants,\ninanimate objects \u2013 are for Spinoza merely modifications or\n\u201cmodes\u201d of the single substance, \u201cways\n[modis]\u201d that God is, just as (to borrow examples from\nLin 2018) a wrinkle in a rug is one way a rug can be, and a fist one\nway a hand can be. Spinoza explicitly applies the barrier doctrine\nalso to modes, stating that no modification of the thinking substance\ncan require for its explanation the concept extension, and no\nmodification of the extended substance can require for its explanation\nthe concept thought:\n\neach attribute is conceived through itself without any other (by\n1p10). So the modes of each attribute involve the concept of their own\nattribute, but not of another one. (E2p6d)\n\n\n(On attributes, see e.g. Gueroult 1958, Deleuze 1968, Shein 2009, Lin\n2019.)\n1.3 The priority of an infinite thinker\n\nAs we just saw, Spinoza derives his prohibition of mental explanations\nof physical actions from what he takes to be true of the relation\nbetween the mental and the physical in the case of God. This\nis an instance of a more general methodological and epistemological\nprinciple Spinoza holds dear, that of the explanatory\npriority of claims about substance (God) to claims about modes\n(creatures) (E1p1, E1p15). To return to our toy analogy, we can only\nunderstand what it is to be a wrinkle in a rug if we first understand\nwhat it is to be a rug. For Spinoza, philosophizing in proper order\nalways requires us to start with God (E2p10s).\n\nGiven this explanatory priority of substance, to understand what it\nmeans to think or to have a mind we also cannot\nsimply extrapolate from our own case (for example, from\nintrospection, or from observing the behavior of fellow humans).\nRather, to understand thought and mindedness we first have to\nunderstand the nature of divine thought, i.e., what it means\nto be an \u201cinfinite\u201d \u2013 unlimited and self-sufficient\n\u2013 thinker. This is the fundamental case of thinking for\nSpinoza.\n\nWhat does this infinite thought amount to? In one sense, it is simply\nan endorsement of the traditional doctrine of divine omniscience. In\nSpinoza\u2019s framework, this doctrine becomes the claim that, as a\nthinking thing (i.e., a substance with the attribute of thought) God\nnecessarily produces an \u201cinfinite idea\u201d, that is,\nan infinite modification of God\u2019s nature as a thinking thing\n(E2p1, E2p3, E2p7c). This infinite idea is a complete and veridical\nrepresentation of everything that is, every bit of reality (E2p32).\n(Spinoza also calls this infinite mode an \u201cinfinite\nintellect\u201d [E2p11c], seemingly without distinguishing the two\nterms.)\n\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Spinoza is making here two\ndistinct claims: to say that God is a substance with the attribute of\nthought (that is, a thing whose essential nature it is to think) is\nontologically and explanatorily prior to the claim that this\nthinking substance also produces an actual representation or\nidea of everything (which is a claim about the existence of a certain\nkind of infinite mode). So although Spinoza faithfully\nfollows tradition in endorsing the claims that God thinks and is\nomniscient, he also ends up with a quite nontraditional result: the\ndivine \u201cinfinite intellect\u201d is not part of, or identical\nwith, divine nature or essence. In terms of its\nontological status, the divine intellect is on par with finite minds\ninsofar as these too are merely modes.\n\nThe belief that the metaphysically basic instance of thinking is the\nthinking done by an infallible and omniscient thinker goes some way\ntoward explaining why Spinoza seems unconcerned about the threat of\nskepticism, so salient for Descartes (see also 3.1). For Spinoza\nthought in its fundamental instance is necessarily true; it\n\u201cagrees\u201d (E1ax6) with how things really are. So\nglobal skepticism is simply a metaphysical impossibility; all\nthat remains of the skeptical threat is to be on guard against local\ninstances of confusion and error that become possible in the\nderivative case of finite thought. Moreover, all such confusion and\nerror need some further cause beyond the intrinsic nature of thought.\n(Indeed, one might worry that Spinoza lets the pendulum swing too far\nin the opposite direction: global skepticism might no longer be\npossible, but it might now be hard to see how error could be\npossible, if, in Spinoza\u2019s substance-monistic framework, all\nideas are ultimately God\u2019s own [see 3.2.2].)\n\n(On Spinoza\u2019s understanding of thinking, see e.g. Melamed 2013,\nNewlands 2018, Renz 2018; on his two proofs that God thinks, e.g.\nDella Rocca 1996, Gueroult 1974; on skepticism, e.g. Carriero 2020,\nPerler 2018, Primus 2017.)\n1.4 Philosophy as a way of life\n\nLast but not least, we should not forget that Spinoza\u2019s magnum\nopus carries the title Ethics. For him knowledge is not\nmerely a theoretical achievement, as if we were solving\nconceptual puzzles for their own sake. For Spinoza, what is at stake\nin understanding anything, including thinking and knowledge, is a\nwhole slew of practical goods: freedom, virtue, blessedness.\nOf the infinity of knowable things, Spinoza writes, he wants to write\nonly about \u201cthose that can lead us, by the hand, as it were, to\nthe knowledge of the human Mind and its highest blessedness\u201d\n(E2pref).\n2. Philosophy of mind\n2.1 Minds\n2.1.1 Minds as bundles\n\nOne reason why Spinoza might not care about distinguishing between\ncalling something God\u2019s \u201cidea\u201d and calling it\nGod\u2019s \u201cintellect\u201d (see 1.3) is that, like Hume, he\nappears to endorse what we today would call the \u201cbundle\ntheory\u201d of mind. On this theory, there is nothing more to\n\u201cminds\u201d and \u201cintellects\u201d than collections of\nideas of various complexity. (For example, the \u201cidea that\nconstitutes the formal being of the human mind is\u2026composed of a\ngreat many ideas\u201d [E2p15].) In particular, minds do not contain\nany specialized \u201cfaculties\u201d, such as will or intellect\n(E2p48). If notions of such faculties are to have any validity at all,\nthey must be understood as mere abstractions from particular\nideas and particular volitions (E2p48s; G/II/130).\n\nFor Spinoza, what individuates one bundle of ideas from\nanother seem to be their intentional objects, i.e., what they represent\n(E2p13s; see 2.1.3\u20134). For example, the aforementioned highly\ncomposite idea that is the \u201chuman mind\u201d has a certain\n\u201cactually existing body\u201d as its essential object (see\n2.2).\n\n(On Spinoza\u2019s bundle view of the mind, see e.g. Della Rocca\n1996; H\u00fcbner 2019; Renz 2018. On abstraction, see 3.2.4; on the\nrelation between ideas and affirmations, see 2.4; on the human mind\nspecifically see 2.2.)\n2.1.2 Minds as parts\n\nSpinoza\u2019s ground-floor commitment to substance monism (i.e., to\nthe metaphysical possibility of only one \u201csubstance\u201d, or\nexistentially and explanatorily independent thing) leaves him with the\nproblem of how to understand the ontological status of finite\nthought. If only one substance exists, what are we to make of human\nminds? These cannot be thinking substances as they are, say,\nfor Descartes or Leibniz. Short of condemning all finite thinking as\nillusory, Spinoza seems to have only one option left: to identify\ncertain instances of God\u2019s own thoughts with finite\nthinking. And this is exactly what Spinoza does: he proposes that we\nregard all finite ideas, and all the finite \u201cminds\u201d these\nideas compose (see 2.1.1), as \u201cparts\u201d of the divine\n\u201cinfinite intellect\u201d:\n\nthe human mind is a part [pars] of the infinite intellect of\nGod. Therefore, when we say that the human mind perceives this or\nthat, we are saying nothing but that God, not insofar as he is\ninfinite, but insofar as he is explained through the nature of the\nhuman mind, or insofar as he constitutes the essence of the human\nmind, has this or that idea. (E2p11c)\n\n\nFinite minds are thus for Spinoza both modes of a thinking\nsubstance and parts of an infinite\nmode that is God\u2019s own \u201cintellect\u201d.\n\nThe claim that finite minds are parts of the divine intellect may\nanswer the question of the ontological status of finite thought, but\nit creates another puzzle: in what sense can a non-extended mind or\nintellect be a \u201cpart\u201d, or have \u201cparts\u201d,\nmoreover parts that are themselves \u201cminds\u201d?\n2.1.3 Panpsychism\n\nAs we just saw, Spinoza accommodates human minds within his\nsubstance-monistic framework by carving up God\u2019s \u201cinfinite\nintellect\u201d into \u201cparts\u201d. But he isn\u2019t\nconcerned solely with making room in his metaphysics for\nhuman minds:\n\nthe things we have shown so far are completely general and do not\npertain more to man than to other individuals, all of which, though in\ndifferent degrees, are nevertheless animate [animata]. For of\neach thing there is necessarily an idea in God, of which God is the\ncause in the same way as he is of the [human mind] (E2p13s)\n\n\nThis is Spinoza\u2019s thesis of panpsychism, or universal mindedness\n(more precisely, universal at least for all \u201cindividuals\u201d\nor composite entities [E2def; G/II/100]). Panpsychism follows because\nall it takes for there to be a finite \u201cmind\u201d in\nSpinoza\u2019s view is that there be some \u201cpart\u201d of the\nomniscient divine intellect \u2013 some component idea of it \u2013\nthat represents some discernible bit of being. So not only is there\nnothing more to minds than ideas (2.1.1), there is nothing more to\ncreaturely minds than God\u2019s ideas.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s panpsychism may certainly seem more morally\nappealing than the vivisection-friendly Cartesian view that animals\nare just more complex versions of tables and clocks. Yet one may also\nwonder whether an account that can explain how human\nmindedness is possible only by instituting a general principle \u2013\nnamely, the divisibility of an omniscient infinite intellect into\ncomponent ideas \u2013 that ushers in also plant and mineral minds\nhas diluted the meaning of \u201cmind\u201d beyond recognition or\nusefulness. Can an account that sees mindedness everywhere explain\nphenomena that, to all appearances, are particular to human\nrationality and self-consciousness? And is Spinoza not guilty here\nsimply of a profound confusion of categories: how can my\nmind just be God\u2019s idea of something? Margaret\nWilson expressed the classic version of these worries, pessimistically\njudging against Spinoza (1999: ch.9).\n\n(On Spinozistic minds, see e.g. Alanen 2011, Koistinen 2018, Lin 2017,\nNewlands 2012; on mind-relativity of representing, see e.g. Matheron\n1969, Donagan 1988, Della Rocca 1996; on individuation of subjects,\nRenz 2018.)\n2.2 Human minds\n2.2.1 Ideas of bodies\n\nAny plausible panpsychism will have to say something about how human\nminds differ from all other minds that populate reality. Spinoza\naccounts for the distinctiveness of the human mind in two ways. First,\nas already noted, he underscores its complexity as a mental\noperation or act of thinking. Using the Scholastic term \u201cformal\nbeing\u201d to pick out this aspect of thinking, he writes,\n\u201cthe idea that constitutes the formal being of the human mind\nis\u2026composed of a great many ideas\u201d (E2p15). Second,\nSpinoza proposes that human minds are also distinct by virtue of what\nthey essentially represent: the essential intentional object\nof the human mind is an actually existing body:\n\n\nThe object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body,\nor a certain mode of Extension which actually exists, and\nnothing else (E2p13)\n\nthe essence of the mind consists in this\u2026that it affirms the\nactual existence of its body (E3GenDefAff [G/II/204]; cf. E2p11,\nE2p17s [G/II/105/32])\n\n\nIn other words, a certain (itself complex) \u201cpart\u201d of the\ndivine infinite intellect will count as a \u201chuman mind\u201d iff\nit essentially represents a certain physical existent. It is in this\nintentional or representationalrelation (and not for example, per\nimpossibile, in some causal relation [see 1.2]) that the\nmind-body \u201cunion\u201d consists in Spinoza\u2019s view:\n\u201cWe have shown that the Mind is united to the Body from the fact\nthat the Body is the object of the Mind\u201d (E2p21d) (cf. Renz\n2018).\n\nA few clarifications are in order. First, on hearing of\nSpinoza\u2019s view we might be inclined to protest that human minds\nrepresent all sorts of things other than our own bodies:\nideas, abstractions, other bodies, etc. (Wilson 1999: ch. 9). But, to\nbe clear, Spinoza isn\u2019t proposing here, rather\nimplausibly, that we represent nothing but our own bodies.\nHis claim is rather about what constitutes the essential\nintentional object of the human mind: other ideas composing my mind\nmay come and go, but to remain the same mind across time, and distinct\nfrom other equally complex bundles of ideas, my mind must continue to\nrepresent a particular physical entity. Moreover, Spinoza holds that\nwe are able to represent all the other things we represent only\nbecause we first conceive of our own body (for details, see 3.2 and\n4).\n\nSecond, that my mind has some actually existing body for its essential\nintentional object also doesn\u2019t mean that I know this\nbody adequately. Far from it: \u201cwe have only completely\nconfused cognition of our body\u201d (E2p13s; cf. E2p27). There are\nseveral reasons Spinoza is led to this pessimistic verdict. For one,\nas we saw, the human mind is essentially an idea of some existing body\nand of \u201cnothing else\u201d (E2p13). In particular, the human is\nnot essentially an idea of the many causes\nresponsible for that body\u2019s composition and continued\nfunctioning. But, on Spinoza\u2019s conception of knowledge,\nunderstanding these causes would be necessary for a complete knowledge\nof that body (E1ax4; cf. Donagan 1988: 129).\n\nHere is another reason why the idea that makes our minds our minds is\n\u201ccompletely confused\u201d. According to Spinoza, the only way\nI can cognize my own body as a particular thing existing in time (as\nopposed to knowing its atemporal \u201cessence\u201d, or knowing the\ngeneral properties of all bodies) is through its modes or\n\u201caffections\u201d \u2013 that is, through the changes or\ndeterminations that this body undergoes, mostly under the influence of\nexternal causes (E2p19). \u201cWe feel that a certain body is\naffected in many ways\u201d (E2ax4): we stub our toes, hear a voice,\nare warmed by the sun, etc. But what we grasp in such experiences is,\naccording to Spinoza, only a \u201cconfused\u201d amalgam\nof the nature of our own body and the nature of the external\ncauses affecting it (for details, see 3.2.2). But, however confused,\nmy first-personal \u201cfeeling\u201d of what happens to my body\nsuffices for distinguishing my \u201cmind\u201d from my ideas of\nother bodies: I don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d in the same way what\nhappens to my sister\u2019s equally complex body (her mind\ndoes), even if I can observe it (and even imitate it empathetically;\nsee E3p27).\n\n(See 4 for continuation of this account; on sense experience and\nerror, see 3.1.2, 3.2.3.)\n2.2.2 Knowing your pancreas and other problems\n\nRecognition that the idea of the body that essentially constitutes a\nhuman mind is \u201ccompletely confused\u201d (E2p13s) goes some way\ntoward defusing Spinoza\u2019s otherwise baffling assertion that we\n\u201cperceive\u201d \u201c[w]hatever happens\nin\u201d that body (E2p12, emphasis added). Prima facie this\nproposition ascribes, implausibly, a godlike omniscience to human\nminds. But experience clearly tells against such a proposal: we\ncertainly aren\u2019t aware of all of the affections of our\nbodies (i.e., of all that \u201chappens in\u201d them), down to the\ncellular (and even quantum) level of each organ. It\u2019s much more\nplausible to take Spinoza\u2019s claim to be that we have such\nperceptions, but their utter confusedness or lack of clarity and\ndistinctness makes them indiscernible to us.\n\nThe initial implausible appearance of E2p12 dissolves even further\nonce we make note of Spinoza\u2019s functional understanding\nof bodies: not everything that we might ordinarily consider a\n\u201cpart\u201d of a body falls under this concept for Spinoza (cf.\nDonagan 1988:123):\n\nparts composing the human Body pertain to the essence of the Body\nitself only insofar as they communicate their motions to one another\nin a certain fixed manner\u2026and not insofar as they can be\nconsidered as Individuals, without relation to the human Body.\n(E2p24d)\n\n\nAccordingly, Spinoza will have a suitably narrower understanding of\nthe scope of \u201cwhatever happens in\u201d the parts of our own\nbodies: we will \u201cperceive\u201d only those affections of the\npancreas, say (to use Della Rocca\u2019s example [2018]), that bear\non the whole body\u2019s ability to function as an integrated\norganism (cf. Garrett 2018: ch.14).\n\nEven if we manage to make sense of the apparent ascription of\nomniscience to human minds, at least two other problems for\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the mind-body relation remain.\n\nFirst, although tying the individuation of certain \u201cparts\u201d\nof the infinite intellect to certain bits of reality that these parts\nessentially represent may well solve the problem of individuating\nfinite minds in a substance-monistic framework (see 2.1.2), it also\nseems to generate a new problem. This is that to explain the nature of\nthe human mind we must now appeal to the existence of\nbodies:\n\nto determine what is the difference between the human Mind and the\nothers, and how it surpasses them, it is necessary for us, as we have\nsaid, to know the nature of its object, i.e., of the human body\n(E2p13s)\n\n\nThe problem is that, as we know (1.2), Spinoza prohibits\ncross-attribute explanations: no physical thing can explain anything\nmental, and vice versa. Yet Spinoza\u2019s own account of the\nessential constitution of human minds seems not just to allow\nfor such cross-attribute explanations, but to require\nthem.\n\nHere is another interpretative problem that seems to plague\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the human mind. How should we understand\nthe relation between 1) the intentional or representational relation\nthat human minds essentially bear to bodies, and 2) Spinoza\u2019s\nclaim that minds and bodies are \u201cone and the same thing\u201d\n(E2p7s)? The doctrine of mind-body identity seems to follow directly\nfor Spinoza from substance\u2019s identity under different\nattributes: since thinking substance and extended substance are in\nfact just a single substance considered or described in two different\nways, so also all of substance\u2019s modifications will be\nsubject to that same sort of multiplicity of descriptions.\nAccordingly, the human mind and the human body are numerically\n\u201cone and the same thing\u201d (namely, a certain finite mode)\nbut this mode can be veridically described as a mind or as a\nbody. But when we pair this doctrine of mind-body identity with the\nthesis of an essential representational relation between the mind and\nthe body, we are faced with the question, Why should a mind represent\nwhat it is numerically identical with, or be identical with what it\nrepresents? How do we make this twofold nature of the mind-body\nrelation intelligible?\n\n(On mind-body identity, see e.g. Delahunty 1985; Della Rocca 1996;\nJarrett 1991; C. Marshall 2009; on its relation to mind-body\nintentionality, Garrett 2018: ch.15; H\u00fcbner forthcoming; for\nsolutions to the barrier violation, e.g. Della Rocca 1996, H\u00fcbner\nforthcoming, 2019.)\n2.3 Consciousness and ideas of ideas\n\nGiven the importance of the concept of consciousness to contemporary\nphilosophy of mind, it is perhaps unsurprising that Spinoza\u2019s\nreaders have tried to extract a full-blown theory of consciousness\nalso from the rare appearances of terms such as conscius and\nconscientia in his writings. Such efforts are also\nunsurprising given Spinoza\u2019s historical placement between\nDescartes (often taken to define thought in terms of consciousness)\nand Leibniz (who distinguishes thinking as a perfectly general\nproperty from consciousness as a property of higher minds alone) (cf.\nLeBuffe 2010). Interpreters return again and again to certain\nquestions: did Spinoza even have a theory of consciousness in\na recognizable sense? If he did, was it an internally consistent and\nadequately defended theory? Was it meant to distinguish conscious and\nunconscious ideas (and so also conscious and unconscious minds [see\n2.1.1])? Did Spinoza posit universal (but perhaps scalar or graded)\nconsciousness, just as he posited universal (but scalar or graded)\nmindedness (see 2.1.3)?\n\nThe existing array of interpretations ranges widely, from\nCurley\u2019s 1969 conclusion that for Spinoza\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d picks out higher order ideas\n(that is, ideas of ideas); through proposals that the term is intended\nto track the complexity (Nadler 2008) or the power\n(D. Garrett 2018: ch.14, E. Marshall 2013) of ideas; to the claim that\nSpinoza uses conscius and conscientia in several\ndifferent senses (LeBuffe 2010b).\n\nThe ideas-of-ideas reading of consciousness gets going because of\npassages like E4p8d, where Spinoza characterizes\n\u201ccognition\u201d of good and evil as\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d of certain emotions (given that\nSpinozistic emotions or \u201caffects\u201d are already themselves\nconstituted in part by \u201cideas\u201d [E3def3]) and E3p9s, where\nSpinoza characterizes \u201cdesire\u201d as \u201cappetite together\nwith consciousness of appetite\u201d (given that\n\u201cappetite\u201d is already \u201crelated to the mind\u201d\n[E3p9s]). In both cases the implication seems to be that consciousness\nis or involves higher order ideas.\n\nOf course, this interpretation of consciousness is of no use to\nsomeone looking to Spinoza for a theory of selective\nconsciousness, on which consciousness distinguishes some mental states\nfrom others. This is because in Spinoza\u2019s framework there is no\nidea of which there is no higher order idea. This follows, first, from\ndivine omniscience (an all-knowing God has ideas of all things,\nincluding all ideas) and, second, from Spinoza\u2019s understanding\nof ideas of ideas as ways of regarding the\nfirst-order ideas, not numerically distinct from them. More precisely,\nfor Spinoza, an idea of idea A is just A considered only as an\nact of thinking (leaving aside its representational content)\n\u2013 or, to use his Scholastic terminology, it is the original idea\nconsidered in its \u201cformal reality\u201d alone: it is \u201cthe\nform of the idea\u2026considered as a mode of thinking without\nrelation to the object\u201d (E2p21s).\n\nInterpretations on which consciousness is a scalar property tracking\ncomplexity or power fare much better in accounting for texts in which\nSpinoza depicts consciousness as a matter of selective causal and\ncognitive achievement, as in the following:\n\nHe who, like an infant or child, has a body capable of very few things\nand very heavily dependent on external causes, has a mind which\nconsidered solely in itself is conscious of almost nothing of itself,\nor of God, or of things. On the other hand, he who has a body capable\nof a great many things, has a mind which considered only in itself is\nvery much conscious of itself, and of God, and of things (E5p39s)\n\n\n(On consciousness see also Miller 2007.)\n2.4 Willing or affirming\n\nSpinoza\u2019s account of willing is developed in opposition to\nDescartes\u2019s account, on several fronts. First, and perhaps most\nfamously, Spinoza denies that human beings have a free\n(undetermined) will (E1app; G/II/78). The freedom that Descartes finds\nundeniable in introspection is for Spinoza only a manifestation of the\ndepths of our ignorance about how we actually have been determined to\nact. Second, Descartes had proposed that we distinguish intellect as a\nfaculty for forming representations, from will as a faculty for\njudging the truth value of these representations. Spinoza rejects both\nthe idea that there are any faculties over and above\nparticular ideas and volitions (cf. 2.1.1), and the separation of the\nrepresentational and volitional elements. Instead he proposes that we\nsee the volitional element as intrinsic to representation,\nsuch that we \u201caffirm insofar as [we] perceiv[e]\u201d (E2p49s\n[III.B(ii)]; G/II/134). In consequence Spinozistic ideas are\nbelief-like: they \u201caffirm\u201d \u2013 posit the\nexistence of \u2013 the things they represent. On this picture, in\nthinking of my dog, for example, I thereby affirm her existence.\n\nOne obvious objection a Cartesian might make to this account is that\nit seems incapable of explaining the familiar experience of merely\nentertaining (imagining, hypothesizing, exploring, etc.) some idea\nwithout committing ourselves to its truth or falsity. As Spinoza puts\nthe objection in the mouth of an imaginary opponent,\n\nsomeone who feigns a winged horse does not on that account grant that\nthere is a winged horse, i.e., he is not on that account\ndeceived\u2026Therefore, experience seems to teach\u2026that the\nwill, or faculty of assenting, is free, and different from the faculty\nof understanding. (E2p49s [III.A.(ii)])\n\n\nTo fend off this objection Spinoza must find a way of explaining the\npossibility of representing something (such as a winged horse) without\ncommitting to its existence, while drawing solely on the resources of\nparticular, intrinsically affirmative ideas. His proposal focuses on\ncountervailing ideas: ideas that affirm or posit something\nthat negates or \u201cexcludes [tollere]\u201d the\nexistence of an object represented by other ideas. For example, a\nchild \u201cimagining a winged horse, and not perceiving anything\nelse\u2026that excludes the existence of the horse\u2026.will\nnecessarily regard the horse as present\u201d (E2p49s [III.B.(ii)];\nG/II/134). But, with some schooling, the child\u2019s original idea\nof a winged horse can be offset by another idea (say, by the rational\nrepresentation of equine bones as, in general, too heavy to be lifted\nby feathers). Spinoza\u2019s proposal explains not only how the\nordinary experience of mere entertainment of ideas is possible, but,\nmore significantly, it arguably offers a genealogy of\nnegation as a basic mental operation derived from affirmation\n(cf. Donagan 1988:46).\n\nThe obvious question Spinoza\u2019s account raises is why, in such\ncases of mental conflict, in which certain ideas \u201cexclude\u201d\none another, should one of these ideas prevail? As Diane Steinberg\nnotes, Spinoza cannot have in mind purely logical\ninconsistency or contradiction between ideas, since this doesn\u2019t\nyet give us a reason to nonarbitrarily prefer one idea over another\n(2003). The psychology of \u201cexclusion\u201d must involve not\nmerely such logical incompatibility of contents, but something that\nwould asymmetrically tip the scales in favor of one idea. Commentators\nhave proposed that greater causal power as the best candidate\nfor this role: the winning idea is the idea with more power to\ncontinue existing and to produce further ideas (in short, greater\npower to \u201cstrive\u201d [E3p7]), or greater power to determine\nthe mind\u2019s activity or causal power as a whole (e.g. Della Rocca\n2003; J. Steinberg 2018b).\n\n(On affirmation, will and excluding ideas see also 3.2.2. On\n\u201cfictions\u201d, see e.g. D. Garrett 2018: ch. 5, J. Steinberg\n2018b; on striving, see e.g. Carriero 2011, Kisner 2011, LeBuffe 2010,\nViljanen 2011, Youpa 2020 and entry on\n Spinoza\u2019s psychological theory.)\n3. Epistemology\n3.1 Truth and adequacy\n\nSpinoza is often taken to endorse the correspondence theory of truth,\nthat is, roughly, the view that truth consists in some sort of\nconformity of thought to reality. Spinoza himself puts the point in\nterms of \u201cagreement\u201d: \u201cA true idea must agree with\n[convenire] its object\u201d (E1ax6).\n\nHowever, this relational property of \u201cagreement\u201d is not\nthe only way Spinoza characterizes truth. True Spinozistic ideas also\nhave an intrinsic and, arguably, introspectable (cf. Garrett\n2018: ch.5) property which distinguishes them as true without\nrequiring us to look beyond the ideas themselves. An\n\u201cadequate\u201d idea is one with this intrinsic property:\n\nBy adequate idea I understand an idea which, insofar as it is\nconsidered in itself, without relation to an object, has all the\nproperties, or intrinsic denominations of a true idea. Exp.:\nsay intrinsic to exclude what is extrinsic, viz. the agreement of the\nidea with its object. (E2def4)\n\n\nConsequently, truth can be \u201cits own standard\u201d, such that\n\u201che who has a true idea at the same time knows that he has a\ntrue idea, and cannot doubt the truth of the thing\u201d (E2p43, cf.\nTIE \u00a736).\n\nThe view is surely puzzling: How is it that just by considering an\nidea on its own, we can be certain that it in fact conforms to what it\nrepresents? What might these intrinsic signs of truth be?\n\nOne plausible answer is that Spinoza has in mind here something like\nclarity and distinctness (cf. e.g. E2p38c), and so is in broad\nagreement with Descartes\u2019s \u201crule\u201d that true ideas\ncan appear to us as clear and distinct. Don Garrett has suggested\nthat, in addition to clarity and distinctness, we should understand\nadequacy as the \u201clogical consistency of the represented\nobject\u201d (2018: ch.6). On this reading, true ideas are\nself-evidently true insofar as we can clearly and distinctly perceive\nthe logical consistency of what they represent. This proposal has the\nvirtue of tying together Spinoza\u2019s two characterizations of\ntruth \u2013 the extrinsic and the intrinsic one \u2013 into one\nneat package: given Spinoza\u2019s commitment to necessitarianism\n(E1p33, E1p35), any logically consistent idea will represent not just\na possible object but a necessary and actual one; hence we can know\nfrom the logical consistency of an idea alone that it in fact\ncorresponds to its object.\n\nThe above definition of adequate idea in terms of a true idea\u2019s\nintrinsic or nonrelational properties is, however, not the only way\nSpinoza characterizes mental \u201cadequacy\u201d. He also gives\nwhat we could call a mind-relative account of adequacy. It is\nmade possible by his belief that finite minds are \u201cparts\u201d\nof the omniscient \u201cinfinite intellect\u201d (see 2.1.2). As he\nexplains, \u201cthere are no inadequate or confused ideas except\ninsofar as they are related to the singular mind of someone\u201d\n(E2p36d):\n\nwhen we say that God has this or that idea, not only insofar as he\nconstitutes the nature of the human Mind, but insofar as he also has\nthe idea of another thing together with the human Mind, then we say\nthat the human Mind perceives the thing only partially, or\ninadequately (E2p11c)\n\n\nIn other words, if ideas constituting a given finite mind suffice for\nrepresenting x in the same way that a perfect\nintellect would represent x, the mind in question represents\nx \u201cadequately\u201d. Eugene Marshall has usefully\nexpressed this point in terms of part-whole \u201ccontainment\u201d:\nideas are adequate iff they are entirely a part of, i.e., contained in,\nthe relevant finite mind (2013:26).\n\nHere is an example of how this might work. Consider once again\nSpinoza\u2019s claim that the idea of the body that essentially\nconstitutes a human mind is \u201ccompletely confused\u201d (see\n2.2.1). We can put this point in terms of inadequacy: a human\nmind knows its body as a particular in duration only by perceiving how\nit is \u201caffected\u201d or changed. This idea of the body is\n\u201cinadequate\u201d in Spinoza\u2019s technical sense because\nGod\u2019s conception of that body includes many components that are\nnot also part of the human mind\u2019s conception of it: God\nconceives of all the many bodies that go into composing, preserving,\nand \u201cregenerating\u201d the affected human body, as well as of\nall the affecting external bodies, and of the infinite series of\ncauses on which these bodies in turn depend (E2p19d).\n\nConfronted with Spinoza\u2019s account of mental adequacy, we might\nwonder how his two characterizations of this concept are supposed to\nhang together: why should an idea entirely contained in a mind also\nhave certain intrinsic markings of truth, such as clarity and\ndistinctness? One way to reconcile these two claims is to infer that\nfor Spinoza only ideas whose \u201cpremises\u201d, so to speak, are\nwholly contained in a given mind can also appear as manifestly or\nself-evidently true. (One might also wonder if finite minds like ours\ncan ever manage to think anything truly \u201cadequately\u201d, if\nthis requires that all of the \u201cpremises\u201d of a\ngiven idea be contained in our minds [cf. Della Rocca 1996]. We come\nback to this question in 3.2.1.)\n\nFinally, some commentators have concluded, further, that an\n\u201cadequate\u201d idea must be contained in a mind insofar as it\nmust also have been \u201cadequately caused\u201d \u2013 i.e.,\nself-sufficiently or autonomously caused \u2013 by the mind in\nquestion, and as such counts as a true \u201caction\u201d of that\nmind, in Spinoza\u2019s technical sense of these terms\n(E3def1\u20132). If that\u2019s right, then adequate ideas must all\nbe innate (LeBuffe 2010, E. Marshall 2013, J. Steinberg\n2018a: ch.8). For having a cause external to the mind \u2013 for\nexample, arising from experience \u2013 would be incompatible by\ndefinition with having been \u201cadequately caused\u201d. On such\nreadings, what we might experience as an acquisition of an\nadequate idea (say, in a philosophy class) is in fact only a matter of\nbecoming more conscious of it (J. Steinberg 2018a: ch.8; see\n2.3).\n\n(See also Kisner 2011.)\n3.2 Knowledge (cognitio)\n\nThe common English translation of Spinoza\u2019s cognitio as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d does not do justice to his understanding of the term,\nwhich includes not just true and adequate ideas, but also inadequate\nand false ones.\n3.2.1 Cognition and causation\n\nPerhaps the most important epistemological principle standardly\nascribed to Spinoza is that to conceive of or cognize x, one\nmust conceive of or cognize its causes. The text cited most\nfrequently in support of this causal interpretation of Spinozistic\ncognition is E1ax4: \u201cCognition of an effect depends on, and\ninvolves, cognition of its cause\u201d (transl. altered). The\ninterpretation finds further support in what has come to be known as\nSpinoza\u2019s \u201cparallelism doctrine\u201d, the proposition\nstating that \u201cThe order and connection of ideas is the same as\nthe order and connection of things\u201d (E2p7). Spinoza\u2019s\nappeal to E1ax4 in the demonstration of this proposition makes clear\nthat the \u201corder and connection of things\u201d he has in mind\nin E2p7 is a causal order and connection (cf.\nE2p9d). The idea that at least for the omniscient\n\u201cinfinite intellect\u201d the connections between ideas\nperfectly mirror the causal connections between things in nature\nfurther supports the thought that for Spinoza cognizing something\nrequires tracking its causes.\n\nDespite the fact that commentators often appeal to E1ax4, the meaning\nof this important axiom is far from clear. There are two main\ninterpretive problems (leaving aside the question of what sorts of\ncauses, out of the rich panoply envisioned by the Aristotelians,\nSpinoza might allow in his metaphysics). The first problem concerns\nthe kind of cognition at stake in E1ax4. Some readers (e.g.\nBennett 1984; Gueroult 1969) have proposed that the axiom governs\nadequate cognition alone. So understood, the axiom expresses\na version of the traditional view that truly \u201cscientific\u201d\nknowledge requires a knowledge of causes \u2013 the knowledge\nwhy something happened, not merely that it happened.\nBut, as Margaret Wilson points out (1999: ch.10), this restricted\nreading of the scope of the axiom can\u2019t be correct, since in\nSpinoza\u2019s view even inadequate ideas formed in sense\nexperience \u201cinvolve\u201d their causes. (For example, the\ninadequate knowledge I have of any bodily change\n\u201cinvolves\u201d the inadequate knowledge of its external cause\n[E2ax1\u2019, E2p25, E2p28].)\n\nA second interpretive problem concerns the meaning of the two terms\n\u2013 \u201cdependence\u201d and \u201cinvolvement\u201d \u2013\nused by Spinoza to characterize the relation between causes and\ncognitions in E1ax4. \u201cInvolvement\u201d is most often glossed\nas \u201cimplication\u201d. But Wilson has argued that in key\npassages (e.g. E2p45) involvere stands more specifically for\nthe relation of implication between an attribute concept\n(e.g. extension, thought) and cognition of a mode (1999:\nch.10). On this reading of \u201cinvolvement\u201d, Spinoza\u2019s\nclaim in E1ax4 that cognition of effects \u201cinvolves\u201d a\ncognition of causes amounts to the relatively intuitive claim that\nconceiving of extension or thought is necessary for conceiving of any\nparticular mind or body. So understood, the axiom doesn\u2019t direct\nus to discover the causes of things so that we may have truly\nscientific knowledge of them, but instead merely describes what is\nentailed by even the most minimal and inadequate conception of\nanything whatsoever.\n\nIn addition to E1ax4 and E2p7, the claim that for Spinoza all\ncognition is cognition of causes also fits with his definition of\n\u201cadequate cause\u201d as one \u201cwhose effect can be clearly\nand distinctly perceived through it\u201d (E3def1), which suggests\nthat causes are at least sufficient for adequately conceiving\nof a thing. Likewise, in E1p11altd1, Spinoza appears to\nidentify the \u201ccauses\u201d of a thing\u2019s\nexistence or nonexistence with \u201creasons [ratio]\u201d\nfor that existence or nonexistence by means of the conjunction\nsive.\n\nNonetheless, the claim that for Spinoza to conceive of x, one\nmust conceive of its causes, faces at least two problems.\nFirst, it\u2019s not clear how to reconcile this position with\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the human mind. As we saw (2.2), cognition\nof the essence of human minds requires reference to actually existing\nbodies; yet, given Spinoza\u2019s commitment to the attribute barrier\n(1.2), bodies cannot stand in a causal relation to anything mental. So\neither Spinoza\u2019s account of the human mind is invalid by his own\nlights or (more likely) Spinoza allows for cognitions that do\nnot depend on a thing\u2019s causes. Second, since each\nfinite thing depends on an \u201cinfinite\u201d series of prior\nfinite causes (E1p28), if cognition of a thing (or at least\nadequate cognition of it) requires a grasp of all\nits causes, this would put an implausible, \u201cstratospherically\nhigh\u201d (Bennett 1984) requirement on cognition. Indeed it would\nput such cognition outside the reach of minds like ours, since, as\nSpinoza admits, we simply cannot know the entire infinite series of\nfinite things responsible for any given state of affairs in nature\n(TIE \u00a7100). Here Wilson\u2019s insight about how Spinoza uses\n\u201cinvolvement\u201d is helpful: we can have adequate\ncausal cognition of particular things, as long as we look to God (the\nfirst and universal cause of all things) and not to the infinite\nseries of prior finite things as the relevant cause, and as\nlong as we attempt to explain the essence of the particular,\nnot its durational states. Spinoza\u2019s doctrine of \u201ccommon\nnotions\u201d (see 3.2.3) guarantees that we have adequate ideas of\nGod under the attributes of extension and thought. And to know God as\nthe cause of the essence of a particular thing is just to have what\nSpinoza calls \u201cintuitive cognition\u201d (see 3.2.5.)\n\n(On causal cognition, see e.g. Koistinen 1996, Morrison 2013, 2015; on\nreconciling it with mind-body account, Della Rocca 1996, H\u00fcbner\n2020; on possibility of adequate cognition, e.g. Marshall 2013.)\n3.2.2 Kinds of cognition I: Imagination and falsity\n\nSpinoza divides cognition into three kinds: imagination;\nreason [ratio]; and intuition [scientia intuitiva].\nThis section focuses on the first of these.\n\nFirst, a terminological warning: what Spinoza calls\n\u201cimagination\u201d shouldn\u2019t be confused with what\nwe are likely to mean by that term today. By\nimaginatio Spinoza understands sense experience (including\ncognition from signs and testimony) and derivative mental processes\n(including memory and the sort of manipulation of mental imagery we\nindeed might call \u201cimagination\u201d). Spinozistic\nimaginatio is distinct in virtue of both its content and its\ncauses. First, it is cognition of external bodies as\npresent; secondly, it is cognition acquired through ideas of\naffections, i.e., changes, of our own body, caused by\nother bodies:\n\naffections of the human body whose ideas present external bodies as\npresent to us, we shall call images of things, even if they do not\nreproduce the [NS: external] figures of things. And when the mind\nregards bodies in this way, we shall say that it imagines (E2p17s;\nG/II/106)\n\n\n(NB: \u201cimage\u201d is another potential terminological trap for\ntoday\u2019s readers: it\u2019s Spinoza\u2019s label for something\nphysical, a modification of the body. In contrast,\n\u201cimagination\u201d names something mental: the act or operation\nof representing, or forming ideas of, these physical\n\u201cimages\u201d.)\n\nOne of the most important claims Spinoza makes about imaginative\ncognition is that it comprises \u201call those ideas which are\ninadequate and confused and so\u2026is the only cause of\nfalsity\u201d (E2p41d). That is, only ideas derived from sense\nexperience alone can give rise to false beliefs. The list of\nobjects of which, Spinoza thinks, we have only such inadequate and\nconfused cognition is staggering: it includes our own bodies; external\nbodies; the affections, parts, and durations of both; finally, even\nour minds (E2p19\u201331) (cf. 2.2.1). As Spinoza concludes\npessimistically, \u201call the notions by which ordinary people are\naccustomed to explain nature are only modes of imagining, and do not\nindicate the nature of anything\u201d (E1app; G/II/83).\n\nWhat sort of \u201cconfusion\u201d does Spinoza have in mind in\nE2p41d? Recall that imaginative cognition consists in ideas of\naffections of, or changes in, our own bodies that also\npresent us, indirectly, with the external causes of\nthese changes. (As Spinoza puts it, all our ideas of our own,\nexternally-caused bodily affections \u201cinvolve\u201d the nature\nof the external cause [E2p16].) So the \u201cconfusion\u201d\ninherent to imaginative cognition seems to do, first, with the fact\nthat imaginative ideas have a content that is an amalgam of\ntwo distinct things: the current condition of some part of my body\nand the properties of the external cause (E2p16, E2p25; cf.\nDella Rocca 1996). For example, when I\u2019m warmed by the sun, the\nnature of that bodily change depends on the nature of the sun\ntogether with the nature and current state of my own body. My\nperception of the bodily affection \u2013 of the increased warmth\n\u2013 tells me something about my own body and\nsomething about the sun; I have some insight into the\nrelative properties of both things. But it doesn\u2019t tell\nme about the intrinsic or fundamental nature either of my own body or\nthe sun. It also doesn\u2019t allow me to clearly separate out the\nrelative contributions of the external cause and of my own body.\n(Indeed, Spinoza goes so far as to propose that that such ideas\n\u201cindicate the condition of our own body more\nthan the nature of the external bodies\u201d [E2p16c2;\nemphasis added].)\n\nWhat about Spinoza\u2019s characterization of imaginative ideas as\n\u201cinadequate\u201d (E2p41d)? Recall that \u201cadequate\u201d\nideas are manifestly true ideas fully explained by the\nmind they help constitute (3.1). So, first, a lack of\nadequacy is a lack of an intrinsic marker of truth, and hence of\ncertainty that we are dealing with true ideas. Hence when\ndealing with imaginative ideas we\u2019re not yet able to\n\u201cdistinguish\u201d with certainty \u201cbetween the true and\nthe false\u201d (E2p402). Of course, we may stumble on the right\nresult (as when we correctly apply a memorized mathematical rule\naccepted on authority [cf. E2p40s2]). But we cannot yet be sure that\nour ideas manage to \u201cagree\u201d with, or correspond to,\nreality.\n\nSecond, as inadequate, imaginative ideas won\u2019t fully\nexplain what they purport to be about. Arguably, the mind thinking\nthem won\u2019t possess all of the \u201cpremises\u201d that\nnecessarily conclude in the idea in question. Instead, that idea will\nhave been produced by, and so will \u201cinvolve\u201d, the natures\nof the external causes that brought about the relevant affection of\nthe body. Instead of being orderly connected to all their premises in\nthe mind (according to what Spinoza calls the \u201corder of the\nintellect\u201d), imaginative ideas will be connected to one another\naccording to the \u201ccommon order of Nature\u201d (E2p29s), that\nis in a way that reflects the order of our happenstance encounters\nwith other bodies, and the idiosyncratic psychological associations\nsuch encounters generate:\n\nFor example, a soldier, having seen traces of a horse in the sand,\nwill immediately pass from the thought of a horse to the thought of a\nhorseman, and from that to the thought of war, etc. But a Farmer will\npass from the thought of a horse to the thought of a plow, and then to\nthat of a field, etc. And so each one, according as he has been\naccustomed to join and connect the images of things in this or that\nway, will pass from one thought to another. (E2p18s)\n\n\nIt is fairly easy to see how ideas whose premises are only partially\ngrasped, and which are haphazardly connected together, could become a\n\u201ccause of falsity\u201d \u2013 that is, could easily generate\nerroneous inferences and associations, as long as we have not yet\ngrasped ideas that would be needed to offset or \u201cexclude\u201d\n(see 2.4) such erroneous inferences and associations:\n\nthe mind does not err from the fact that it imagines, but only insofar\nas it is considered to lack an idea which excludes the existence of\nthose things which it imagines to be present to it (E2p17s)\n\n\nTo take an example important for the history of philosophy, our belief\nin free will, on Spinoza\u2019s analysis, is precisely a false belief\nthat follows from sense experience not offset by countervailing ideas:\nit arises because \u201cwe are conscious of [our] actions and\nignorant of [their] causes\u201d (E2p35s). Any perception of my own\naction will be \u201cinadequate\u201d (i.e., merely partial or\n\u201cmutilated\u201d by comparison to God\u2019s infallible idea\nof that same action) if the ideas of all the necessitating causes of\nthat action are not also part of my mind. Such a\n\u201cmutilated\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d idea of my own\naction can generate a false belief in free will as long as I lack\npotentially offsetting ideas \u2013 say, of the general\nnecessity of all actions in nature (e.g. E1p33), together with an\nunderstanding of myself as subject to the very same laws as\nany other natural thing (E3pref; G/II/138).\n\nThis picture of falsehood as the result of the confusion and\nmutilation of ideas generated by sense experience, combined with the\nabsence of countervailing ideas, is behind Spinoza\u2019s claim that\n\u201cfalsity\u201d is \u201cnothing positive\u201d, only a\nrelative \u201cprivation of knowledge\u201d (E2p35) about the matter\nat hand. (Falsity so understood must also be distinguished from an\n\u201cabsolute\u201d \u201cignorance\u201d of something\n[E2p35d].)\n\nThe lack of ideas that could exclude or offset false conclusions\ncarries another epistemic danger, and contributes to the loss of our\n\u201cpower\u201d to think in yet another way: any ideas we have\nfailed to exclude lie in the mind ready to be combined with any\nadequate ideas we\u2019ve managed to secure, thereby\nundermining the epistemic good that the latter bring with them. For\nexample, if we have not yet excluded the ideas of divine\ngoodness or divine purposiveness from our\nminds (see E1app), we can easily \u201cjoin\u201d such inadequate\nideas to the concept God.\n3.2.3 Kinds of cognition II: Intellect, common notions and reason\n\nSpinoza contrasts confused and falsehood-inviting imagination with\n\u201cintellect\u201d, which he subdivides further into\n\u201creason\u201d and \u201cintuition\u201d. Given\nSpinoza\u2019s bundle-theoretic approach to minds (2.1.1), talk of\n\u201cintellect\u201d is not intended to conjure up here some sort\nof mental \u201cfaculty\u201d over and above particular ideas.\n\u201cIntellect\u201d is instead Spinoza\u2019s name for a certain\ntype of cognition, namely cognition that is \u201cnecessarily\ntrue\u201d (E2p41). That is, intellectual ideas necessarily\n\u201cagree\u201d with, or correspond to, represented objects\n(E1ax6; see 3.1). This \u201cagreement\u201d with how things really\nare in the world allows intellectual ideas to both be \u201cthe same\nin all men\u201d (E2p18s), and to reflect the actual causal order of\nthings in nature. Hence Spinoza can also describe intellect as\ncognition of things \u201cthrough their first causes\u201d (E2p18s,\ncf. E2p7), that is, ultimately through the all-necessitating divine\nessence that determines the causal order of things (E1p15, E1p16).\nIntellectual ideas are also \u201cadequate\u201d (E2p41d), that is,\nmanifestly true and fully explained by the mind they help constitute\n(3.1). Because intellectual ideas of truth and falsity in particular\nare manifestly true, intellectual cognition enables us to\n\u201cdistinguish the true from the false\u201d with certainty\n(E2p42).\n\nSo how do we get our hands on this cornucopia of epistemic goods?\nSpinoza warns that \u201cideas which are clear and distinct in\nus\u201d (i.e., \u201cadequate\u201d, or manifestly true, ideas)\n\u201ccannot follow from mutilated and confused ideas\u201d\n(E5p28d; emphasis added). This would seem to preclude any\npossibility of progressing from imagination to intellect. Fortunately\nSpinoza leaves an escape hatch in the form of \u201ccommon\nnotions\u201d, which he calls, appropriately, the\n\u201cfoundations\u201d of reason, i.e., of the first of two kinds of\nintellectual cognition (E2p40s1). We may not be able to generate clear\nand distinct ideas from confused ideas, but not all is yet\nlost, because according to Spinoza even brute sense experience\nfurnishes us with some necessarily true and adequate ideas\n(or, on innatist readings [see 3.1], triggers or activates such\nideas).\n\nMore precisely, in Spinoza\u2019s view, in every encounter with\nanother thing, not matter how confused my ideas of both my own body\nand the external body (3.2.2), I also form necessarily\nadequate ideas of any properties that are both 1)\n\u201ccommon\u201d to the interacting bodies and 2) \u201cequally\nin the part and in the whole\u201d (E2p38). That is, I form\nnecessarily adequate ideas of any properties wholly and without\ndistinction present in each particular thing. For example, the\nproperty of being extended is one such property: extension is\nextension is extension, whether it belongs to me or to a mosquito\nbiting me; I am neither more nor less of a physical thing than a\nmosquito is. Likewise, every body possesses the property of having a\ncapacity for \u201cmotion and rest\u201d (\u201call bodies\nagree\u2026in that they can move now more slowly, now more quickly,\nand that now they move, now they are at rest\u201d [E2Ld]). For\nSpinoza, all such properties that are both universally instantiated\n(\u201ccommon\u201d to all things) and non scalar (\u201cequally in\nthe part and in the whole\u201d) are necessarily grasped correctly by\nany mind. And all ideas of such properties \u2013 all\n\u201ccommon notions\u201d \u2013 are necessarily adequate.\n\nWhat is Spinoza\u2019s argument for this rather implausible claim,\nthat we simply cannot get certain properties (such as extension,\nthought, motion and rest) wrong? As we have seen, a lot\nhinges on this doctrine: nothing less than the very possibility of\nintellectual emendation, of transcending the confusion and inadequacy\nof mere imagination. The answer has to do with how Spinoza thinks\nabout what is responsible for the absence of adequacy. As we\nsaw above (3.2.2), in his view, any ideas of external bodies that I\nform through mere sense experience will in fact be ideas of how those\nbodies affect me. (For example, my empirical idea of the sun\nin fact only represents one way the sun can affect my body in its\ncurrent state.) But common properties like extension are\n\u201cequally in the part and in the whole\u201d: wholly and without\ndistinction in each thing. So for the adequacy of my idea of the sun\nas extended it does not matter if I\u2019m representing\nextension as it is in the sun, or as it is in my body, or as it is in\nthe \u201cconfused\u201d amalgam of the two. Extension is extension\nis extension. Because common notions are insulated against error in\nthis way, and because no idea inferable from an adequate idea can\nitself be inadequate (E2p40), these notions can indeed form a\n\u201cfoundation\u201d of reasoning, and so be our entry point into\nthe realm of the intellect.\n\nWhat is sometimes overlooked in discussions of common notions is that\nSpinoza allows for two kinds of common notions: what we could\ncall 1) universal common notions, notions of truly\nuniversally instantiated non-scalar properties, such as extension; and\n2) relative common notions, ideas of properties \u201ccommon\nto, and peculiar to [proprium], the human body and certain\nexternal bodies by which the human Body is usually affected\n[affici solet], and is equally in the part and in the whole\nof each of them\u201d (E2p39). It\u2019s not obvious what to make of\nthis characterization of the second type of common notion. What counts\nas being \u201cpeculiar\u201d to what \u201cusually\u201d affects\nus? For example, are the general ideas Spinoza relies on in his\naccount of the human mind and human emotions (\u201caffects\u201d)\ncommon notions in this more circumscribed sense? We could pose the\nsame question of universal common notions: what should we\ninclude in that list, beyond the fairly uncontroversial examples of\nextension, thought, motion-and-rest?\n\nOne interesting upshot of Spinoza allowing for this second, relative\ntype of common notion is that our ability to transcend mere sense\nexperience into the realm of reason is not simply a function of the\ninvariable ontological make-up of the world, of there being only so\nmany truly universal on/off properties. We can also do\nsomething to increase the number of common notions that it is possible\nfor beings like us to have given our \u201cusual\u201d environments.\nThe more we can make it the case that we have something in common with\nthings around us \u2013 and in part this means, the more diverse\nwe ourselves are (cf. Sharp 2011: 98\u20139) \u2013 the\nbroader the epistemic \u201cfoundation\u201d on which we can rely in\nreasoning.\n\nFinally, once again, the fact that no common notion on its\nown can be a cause of falsity doesn\u2019t mean that we cannot\nput common notions, of either kind, to bad use: we can still\n\u201cjoin\u201d adequate ideas to ideas of more dubious value,\nproducing more complex inadequate representations (cf.\n3.2.2). Hence even if we necessarily adequately conceive of God as\na thinking thing, we still are in danger of joining this adequate\nidea to that of a benign or vengeful ruler as the referent of the name\nGod.\n\n(On reason, see e.g. Kisner 2011; LeBuffe 2017, Malinowski-Charles\n2010; on common notions, Donagan 1988; Primus 2017.)\n3.2.4 Generality and abstraction\n\nSpinoza\u2019s doctrine of common notions is inseparable from a\nlarger interpretative puzzle. This puzzle concerns Spinoza\u2019s\nstance on the validity of general concepts more broadly\n\u2013 in particular, of concepts of kinds, such as horse,\nanimal, or being.\n\nCertain things are fairly clear. For example, it\u2019s clear that in\nhis ontology, Spinoza is committed to the existence of particulars\nalone (that is, roughly, things that cannot exist in many places at\nthe same time). It is also clear that, in his view, conceptual\ngenerality \u2013 and in particular the operation of\nabstracting from particulars \u2013 are rife with the\npossibility of error. (For example, we can be led to overlook\ndifferences among particulars [TIE \u00a776], or mistake the products\nof our own abstraction for \u201creal beings\u201d, when in fact the\nresulting ideas present only mind-dependent \u201cbeings of\nreason\u201d [Metaphysical Thoughts [= CM]\n1.1; TIE \u00a793]). Finally, it\u2019s also clear that for Spinoza\nideas of universals and abstractions often have lower\nepistemic value than ideas of particulars (e.g. TIE \u00a793).\n\nThese considerations have led some readers to take Spinoza to reject\nall general and abstract ideas as inadequate (e.g. Curley\n1973; Savan 1958). Such readings have trouble explaining\nSpinoza\u2019s own reliance on words that seem to refer to general\nconcepts (such as mode, idea, body, etc.). In particular,\nmany of Spinoza\u2019s moral and socio-political doctrines \u2013\nand so the whole enterprise of the Ethics (see 1.4) \u2013\nseem to hinge on the validity of the general idea of \u201chuman\nnature\u201d. Spinoza seems to believe that human beings share an\nessential nature, even if they realize it to different degrees, and\nhence also a common good. Here is a representative passage:\n\nthe greatest good of those who seek virtue is to know God,\ni.e.\u2026a good that is common to all men, and can be possessed\nequally by all men insofar as they are of the same nature (E4p36d; cf.\nE4p35, E4AppIX)\n\n\nOne interpretative option here is to conclude that for Spinoza general\nand abstract ideas such as \u201chuman nature\u201d have only some\npragmatic value (cf. Carriero 2005). Spinoza clearly\nrecognizes usefulness as an epistemic good (for example, he describes\nAristotelian ideas of genera and species as handy mnemonic devices\n[CM1.1]). On such a reading, it might not be strictly speaking true\nthat there is a common human nature, instantiated by each particular\nhuman being; nonetheless, for ethical or political ends it might be\nuseful to invoke such an idea. But even this reading will have trouble\nexplaining how Spinoza can nonetheless insist that the \u201ctrue\nknowledge we have of good and evil\u201d \u2013 again, hardly a\nminor issue for an Ethics \u2013 is \u201cabstract,\nor universal\u201d (E4p62s; G/II/257).\n\nIt helps to be precise about the nature of Spinoza\u2019s\ncriticisms of general and abstract ideas: falling short of an\nepistemic ideal is not the same as utter inadequacy. Likewise,\nmind-dependence is not the same as illusion or error. (Neither Leibniz\nnor Kant, for example, would want to say that the idea or form of\nspace is an error or an illusion.) Finally, Spinoza\u2019s most\nextensive criticism of general ideas, in E2p40s2, is not a criticism\nof general ideas simpliciter, but only of most general ideas\nderived from sense experience (cf. Bennett 1984). In Spinoza\u2019s\nview, as finite and embodied beings whose minds are essentially ideas\nof what happens to our bodies (2.2.1), we can\u2019t avoid\nthinking in general terms. When our bodies interact with other bodies\n\u2013 when we smell roses, or stub our toes \u2013 these encounters\nleave impressions (\u201cimages\u201d) on our bodies; the finitude\nof our bodies allows them to retain only a limited number of\ndistinct \u201cimages\u201d since over time they get\noverlaid and confused. The ideas we form by thinking the resulting\ncomposite \u201cimages\u201d, and then predicate of indefinitely\nmany other entities \u2013 ideas such as horse,\nanimal, or being \u2013 represent distinctly only\nwhat the bodies we happen to come across have in common insofar as\nthey can affect a human body. General ideas formed in this way are\njust as \u201cconfused\u201d, inadequate and idiosyncratic, as any\nother imaginative idea (see 3.2.2). So, contrary to what the\nAristotelians held, sense experience doesn\u2019t suffice\nfor true ideas of the essences of things. (Rather it gives rise to\nunending philosophical controversies, as each one of us fashions\ngeneral types according to what we have experienced.)\n\nMoreover, we also can\u2019t forget that, as we know from our\ndiscussion of common notions (3.2.3), Spinoza doesn\u2019t think that\nall general ideas grounded in sense experience alone result\nin confused representations. Indeed, beyond this foundational\nsphere of common notions, Spinoza seems to think of\n\u201creason\u201d on the whole as a necessarily adequate\nway of forming general ideas:\n\nit is clear that we perceive many things and form universal\nnotions: I. from singular things which have been\nrepresented to us through the senses\u2026 II. from\nsigns\u2026 These two ways of regarding things I shall henceforth\ncall knowledge of the first kind, opinion or imagination. III.\nFinally, from the fact that we have common notions and adequate\nideas of the properties of things\u2026This I shall call reason\nand the second kind of knowledge (E2p40s2; emphases added)\n\n\nIn other words, for Spinoza both (confused and inadequate) imagination\nand (necessarily adequate) reason are ways of forming general ideas;\nwhat distinguishes reason and imagination is in part the epistemic\nvalue of their respective \u201cuniversal notions\u201d. The general\nideas that belong to imagination are, as we have seen, confused and\ninadequate and can lead us into error (3.2.2). The general ideas that\nbelong to reason \u2013 in particular, common notions and their\nderivatives \u2013 are, like all ideas of reason, necessarily\nadequate (3.2.3). The question that remains is whether Spinoza\nrecognizes any other rational and general \u201cadequate ideas of\nproperties\u201d beyond those implied by common notions.\n\n(See also e.g. Newlands 2015, H\u00fcbner 2016.)\n3.2.5 Kinds of cognition III: Intuition\n\nSpinoza characterizes scientia intuitiva as the kind of\ncognition that \u201cproceeds from an adequate idea of the formal\nessence of certain attributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the\n[NS: formal] essence of things\u201d (E2p40s2). Given Spinoza\u2019s\nclaim that only infinite things can follow from infinite things\n(E1p21\u201323), it seems that the \u201cformal essences\u201d of\nparticular things that intuition infers from the essences of divine\nattributes must themselves be infinite (D. Garrett 2018:ch.7).\n\nAs noted above (3.2.3), Spinoza classifies intuition, alongside\nreason, as intellectual rather than imaginative cognition. As such,\nintuition is \u201cnecessarily true\u201d (E2p41); allows us to\n\u201cdistinguish the true from the false\u201d (E2p42); is\n\u201cthe same in all men\u201d (E2p18s); and is cognition of things\n\u201cthrough their first causes\u201d (E2p18s). Yet intuition also\nclearly exceeds reason as an epistemic achievement in\nSpinoza\u2019s eyes: it is intuition and not reason that he describes\nas \u201cthe greatest virtue of the mind\u201d (E5p25) and the\n\u201cgreatest human perfection\u201d (E5p27d), capable of affecting\nthe mind with a unique degree of force (E5p36s). Intuition is also the\nonly cognition on which Spinoza bestows the traditional honorific of\n\u201cscientia\u201d (D. Garrett 2018:ch.7).\n\nWhat is responsible for this singular place of intuition? Commentators\nare divided. Some (e.g. Soyarslan 2016) propose that it allows us to\nknow truths that reason doesn\u2019t. Others (e.g. Nadler 2003) think\nintuition is superior to reason as an epistemic method alone.\nThis latter interpretation is a natural way to understand\nSpinoza\u2019s own mathematical illustration of the ways all\nkinds of cognition, from imagination to intuition, can achieve the\nsame correct result (E2p40s2). Likewise, as many of Spinoza\u2019s\npredecessors have also held, intuition is an immediate\nknowledge, an insight \u201cin one glance\u201d (E2p40s2) into\nessences. The principal superiority of intuition seems to stem from\nthe fact that it is in the business of cognizing essences\ndirectly, without the mediation of ideas of mere properties\nof things, whether \u201ccommon\u201d properties or other\n\u201cadequate ideas of properties\u201d, which form, as we have\nseen, the foundations of reason (3.2.3).\n\n(See also e.g. Carriero 2020, Primus 2017, Wilson 1999: ch.11.)\n4. Eternity of the mind\n\nSpinoza\u2019s doctrine of the eternity of the mind, one of last\nsubjects of the Ethics, has occasioned some of the most\nimpatient and uncharitable comments on the part of his readers (most\nfamously perhaps, Bennett 1984 describes it as \u201crubbish\u201d\nleading others to write rubbish). The cause for this impatience is\nSpinoza\u2019s declaration that in Part 5 he will discuss \u201cthe\nmind\u2019s duration without relation to the body\u201d (E5p20s), a\ndeclaration some see as a blatant violation of his commitment to\nmind-body identity in Part 2 (E2p7s). But of course an identity of one\nthing with another doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility of\ndiscussing one but not the other, a procedure in which\nSpinoza engages again and again (for example, in introducing the\npossibility of ideas of ideas [see 2.3]). Spinoza is moreover quite\nexplicit that there is no eternity of human minds without a\ncorresponding eternity of bodies, and, far from contradicting any\ncommitments about mind-body relations made in Part 2, the doctrine of\nthe eternity of the mind in Part 5 arguably brings to light the full\nmeaning of those earlier commitments.\n\nTo recall (2.2.1), in Part 2 Spinoza proposes that the \u201cfirst\nthing\u201d that constitutes this \u201cactual being\u201d of a\nhuman mind is an idea of an \u201cactually exist[ing]\u201d body\n(E2p11\u201313). Only in Part 5 does Spinoza clarify that\n\u201cactual\u201d being or existence can be understood in two ways:\nfirst, in the temporal or durational sense key to the claims made in\nPart 2, and second, in an atemporal or purely ontological sense of\nsimply having being or reality at all (as opposed to, for example,\nbeing merely possible):\n\nWe conceive things as actual in two ways: either insofar as we\nconceive them to exist in relation to a certain time and place, or\ninsofar as we conceive them to be contained in God and to follow from\nthe necessity of the divine nature. But the things we conceive in this\nsecond way as true, or real, we conceive under a species of\neternity (E5p29s)\n\n\nGiven these two senses of \u201cactuality\u201d, Spinoza\u2019s\noriginal claim in Part 2 that the \u201cactual being\u201d of the\nhuman mind is an idea of an \u201cactually exist[ing]\u201d body can\nalso be understood in two ways. First, it can be understood as a claim\nabout what it takes for a human mind to begin existing in\ntime, as we have done in 2.2.1: any human mind starts to\nactually exist in a durational sense when the nexus of bodily causes\nin nature generates a new body, which then begins to be variously\naffected or changed by external causes. The infinite intellect, in its\nindefatigable omniscience, begins to represent these affections or\nchanges. The relevant \u201cpart\u201d of God\u2019s omniscient\nidea (see 2.1.2) is a new, temporally existing human mind. More\nplainly put, a human \u201cinfant\u201d is born, with \u201ca body\ncapable of very few things, and\u2026a mind\u2026conscious of\nalmost nothing\u201d (E5p39s).\n\nThis is the first, more intuitive sense in which human minds can be\nsaid to \u201cactually exist\u201d, the sense in which your mind\nexists now when processing these words. But however much we may be\nattached to our temporal selves and all that they feel, for Spinoza\nthere is another sense of \u201cactual existence\u201d. In that\nsecond sense, a human mind is still essentially an \u201cactually\nexisting\u201d idea of a certain \u201cactually existing\u201d bit\nof extension. But the relevant bit of extension is not the living\nhuman body, but its eternal essence \u2013 a certain\neternally possible way that divine extension can modify itself to take\non a certain ratio of motion and rest (cf. E2def[8]; G/II/100), i.e., a\ncertain determinate functional pattern of physical activity. In its\nomniscience, the divine substance eternally understands itself as\nbeing capable of being modified in such more determinate ways \u2013\nthat is, of manifesting its own physical being as this or that snail\nor sunflower or human infant. Ideas of these eternal bodily\nessences are eternal \u201cparts\u201d of substance\u2019s\ninfinite intellect (E2p8). That is, for each bodily essence there is a\ndivine idea that \u201cexpresses the essence of the body under a\nspecies of eternity\u201d (E5p23s), as an eternal part of the\ninfinite intellect.\n\nThe eternal idea of a bodily essence is not only a part of God\u2019s\nintellect (as all ideas are), it is also an eternal \u201cpart\u201d\nof the relevant human mind, a \u201cpart\u201d that\n\u201cremains\u201d (E5p23) even after the body\u2019s demise, when\nthere are no more ideas of bodily affections to be \u201cfelt\u201d.\nThis then is all there is also to human immortality, in\nSpinoza\u2019s view: the eternal existence of the essences of our\nbodies, and of ideas of those bodies. As Nadler emphasizes (2002), we\nare far here from any traditional doctrine of personal immortality:\nnothing that does not belong to us essentially, and nothing that\ndepends on sense experience, such as memories, persists beyond\ndeath.\n\nSpinoza attaches an epistemic challenge to this ontological\npicture. He writes that we always \u201cunderstand\u201d and\n\u201cfeel\u201d \u201cthat we are eternal\u201d (E5p23s):\npresumably this means that we have some joyful, i.e., empowering\n(E3p11d), intellectual grasp of our own eternity (even if we often\njoin these adequate ideas with inadequate ones [see 3.2.2], such as\nreward or punishment). But he also suggests, prima\nfacie puzzlingly, that we can increase the degree of our own\neternity: \u201cthe more the mind understands things by the second\nand third kind of cognition, the greater the part [maxima\npars] of it that remains\u201d after the destruction of the body\n(E5p38d). This suggestion might seem puzzling if we assume that the\n\u201ceternal part\u201d of my mind is just the eternal\nidea of the eternal essence of my own body. For then there\nseems to be nothing that would be subject to improvement or\nenlargement: my eternal essence just is my eternal essence.\n\nBut arguably this is not how Spinoza understands the eternal part of\nthe mind. The idea of the eternal essence of the body is just the\n\u201cfirst thing [primum]\u201d (cf. E2p11) that grounds\nmy mind\u2019s eternal existence: it is the foundation of\neternal ideas of other things, just as the durational idea of this\nbody as changing is the foundation of imaginative ideas of other\nthings. \u201c[T]he Mind is eternal, insofar as it conceives things\nunder a species of eternity\u201d (E5p31s). Since for Spinoza any\nhuman mind is essentially an idea of a certain \u201cactually\nexisting\u201d body, cognition of that body is the foundation of\nall cognition whatsoever. This is true whether we are talking\nabout imaginative cognition of the external bodies we bump up against\nin duration; or about intellectual cognition of eternally existing\nessences: \u201cWhatever the mind understands under a species of\neternity, it understands\u2026from the fact that it conceives the\nbody\u2019s essence under a species of eternity\u201d (E5p29). In\nshort, for Spinoza all cognition of eternal truths rests on a\ncognition of our own body as an eternal essence. We can thus\nunderstand the idea of enlarging or maximizing the eternal\n\u201cpart\u201d of our minds in terms of the number of eternal\ntruths, intuitive and rational, that we can acquire in the course of\nour existence \u2013 or, as on innatist readings (see 3.1), the\nnumber of eternal truths that we can make into powerful\n\u201cparts\u201d of our minds.\n\n(On consciousness, see 2.3; on imaginative cognition of the body see\n2.2 and 3.2.2. On eternity of the mind, see also e.g. Garrett 2018:\nch.9.
