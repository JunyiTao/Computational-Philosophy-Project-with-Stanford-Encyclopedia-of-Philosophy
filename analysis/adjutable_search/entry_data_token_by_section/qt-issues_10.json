Ontological Issues\n\nAs mentioned, a central question of interpretation of quantum\nmechanics concerns whether quantum states should be regarded as\nrepresenting anything in physical reality. If this is answered in the\naffirmative, this gives rise to new questions, namely, what sort of\nphysical reality is represented by the quantum state, and whether a\nquantum state could in principle give an exhaustive account of\nphysical reality.\n",
