Method in Practice\n\nAttention to scientific practice, as we have seen, is not itself new.\nHowever, the turn to practice in the philosophy of science of late can\nbe seen as a correction to the pessimism with respect to method in\nphilosophy of science in later parts of the 20th century,\nand as an attempted reconciliation between sociological and\nrationalist explanations of scientific knowledge. Much of this work\nsees method as detailed and context specific problem-solving\nprocedures, and methodological analyses to be at the same time\ndescriptive, critical and advisory (see Nickles 1987 for an exposition\nof this view). The following section contains a survey of some of the\npractice focuses. In this section we turn fully to topics rather than\nchronology.\n",
