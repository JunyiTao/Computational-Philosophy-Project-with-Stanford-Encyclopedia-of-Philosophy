    "main_text": "Basic Questions || Good, Better, Bad\n1.2 Good, Better, Bad\n1.2.1 Good and Better\n\nOn a natural view, the relationship between \u201cgood\u201d,\n\u201cbetter\u201d, and \u201cbest\u201d would seem to be the same\nas that between \u201ctall\u201d, \u201ctaller\u201d, and\n\u201ctallest\u201d. \u201cTall\u201d is a gradable adjective, and\n\u201ctaller\u201d is its comparative form. On standard views,\ngradable adjectives are analyzed in terms of their comparative form.\nAt bottom is the relation of being taller than, and someone is\nthe tallest woman\u00a0just in case she is taller than every woman.\nSimilarly, someone is tall, just in case she is taller than a\ncontextually appropriate standard (Kennedy [2005]), or taller than\nsufficiently many (this many be vague) in some contextually\nappropriate comparison class.\n\nMuch moral philosophy appears to assume that things are very different\nfor \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cbetter\u201d, and \u201cbest\u201d.\nInstead of treating \u201cbetter than\u201d as basic, and something\nas being good just in case it is better than sufficiently many in some\ncomparison class, philosophers very often assume, or write as if they\nassume, that \u201cgood\u201d is basic. For example, many theorists\nhave proposed analyses of what it is to be good\u00a0which are\nincompatible with the claim that \u201cgood\u201d is to be\nunderstood in terms of \u201cbetter\u201d. In the absence of some\nreason to think that \u201cgood\u201d is very different from\n\u201ctall\u201d, however, this may be a very peculiar kind of claim\nto make, and it may distort some other issues in the theory of\nvalue.\n1.2.2 Value\n\nMoreover, it is difficult to see how one could do things the other way\naround, and understand \u201cbetter\u201d in terms of\n\u201cgood\u201d. Jon is a better sprinter than Jan not because it\nis more the case that Jon is a good sprinter than that Jan is a good\nsprinter \u2014 they are both excellent sprinters, so neither one of\nthese is more the case than the other. It is, however, possible to see\nhow to understand both \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d in\nterms of value. If good is to better as tall is to taller, then the\nanalogue of value should intuitively be height. One person is taller\nthan another just in case her height is greater; similarly, one state\nof affairs is better than another just in case its value is greater.\nIf we postulate something called \u201cvalue\u201d to play this\nrole, then it is natural (though not obligatory) to identify value\nwith amounts of values \u2014 amounts of things like pleasure\nor knowledge, which \u201cvalue\u201d claims claim to be good.\n\nBut this move appears to be implausible or unnecessary when applied to\nattributive \u201cgood\u201d. It is not particularly plausible that\nthere is such a thing as can-opener value, such that one can-opener is\nbetter than another just in case it has more can-opener value. In\ngeneral, not all comparatives need be analyzable in terms of something\nlike height, of which there can be literally more or less. Take, for\nexample, the case of \u201cscary\u201d. The analogy with height\nwould yield the prediction that if one horror film is scarier than\nanother, it is because it has more of something \u2014 scariness\n\u2014 than the other. This may be right, but it is not obviously so.\nIf it is not, then the analogy need not hold for \u201cgood\u201d\nand its cognates, either. In this case, it may be that being better\nthan does not merely amount to having more value than.\n1.2.3 Good and Bad\n\nThese questions, moreover, are related to others. For example,\n\u201cbetter\u201d would appear to be the inverse relation of\n\u201cworse\u201d. A is better than B just in case B is worse than\nA. So if \u201cgood\u201d is just \u201cbetter than sufficiently\nmany\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d is just \u201cworse than\nsufficiently many\u201d, all of the interesting facts in the\nneighborhood would seem to be captured by an assessment of what stands\nin the better than relation to what. The same point goes if to\nbe good is just to be better than a contextually set standard. But it\nhas been held by many moral philosophers that an inventory of what is\nbetter than what would still leave something interesting and important\nout: what is good.\n\nIf this is right, then it is one important motivation for denying that\n\u201cgood\u201d can be understood in terms of \u201cbetter\u201d.\nBut it is important to be careful about this kind of argument.\nSuppose, for example, that, as is commonly held about\n\u201ctall\u201d, the relevant comparison class or standard for\n\u201cgood\u201d is somehow supplied by the context of utterance.\nThen to know whether \u201cthat is good\u201d is true, you do\nneed to know more than all of the facts about what is better than what\n\u2014 you also need to know something about the comparison class or\nstandard that is supplied by the context of utterance. The assumption\nthat \u201cgood\u201d is context-dependent in this way may therefore\nitself be just the kind of thing to explain the intuition which drives\nthe preceding argument.\n",
