    "main_text": "The System of Positive Polity and the Complete Positivism || The religion of Humanity\n5.3 The religion of Humanity\n\nThe System\u2019s subtitle is Treatise on Sociology\nInstituting the Religion of Humanity. While the different forms\nof deism preserve the idea of God and dissolve religion into a vague\nreligiosity, Comte proposes exactly the contrary: a religion with\nneither God nor the supernatural. His project had little success; he\neven accomplished a tour de force by uniting both believers\nand non-believers against him. The many ridiculous details of\nComte\u2019s religion made the task of his opponents even easier. But\nthis aspect of Comte\u2019s thought deserves better than the\ndiscredit into which it has fallen (Wernick 2000; de Lubac 1945).\n\nComte defines religion as \u2018the state of complete harmony\npeculiar to human life [\u2026] when all the parts of Life are\nordered in their natural relations to each other\u2019 (1851, v. 2,\n8; E.,v. 2, 8). Comte also defines religion as a consensus, analogous\nto what health is for the body. Religion has two functions, according\nto the point of view from which one considers existence: in its moral\nfunction, religion should govern each individual; in its political\nfunction, it should unite all individuals. Religion also has three\ncomponents, corresponding to the threefold division of the cerebral\ntable: doctrine, worship, and moral rule (discipline).\nComte\u2019s discussion is mainly about the first two. If one\nconsiders the first to be related to faith and the second to love,\ntheir relation takes two forms: \u2018Love comes first and leads us\nto the faith, so long as the growth is spontaneous; but when it\nbecomes systematic, then the belief is constructed in order to\nregulate the action of love\u2019 (1852, v. 2, 152; E., v. 2, 83). At\nfirst, Comte had followed the traditional order and presented doctrine\nbefore worship, but he soon gave priority to worship, and saw this\nchange as a considerable step forward.\n\nIn the positivist religion, worship, doctrine and moral rule all have\nthe same object, namely Humanity, which must be loved, known, and\nserved. Already the General Conclusions of the\nCourse compared the concept of Humanity to that of God,\naffirming the moral superiority of the former. But only in 1847 does\nComte make the substitution explicitly; sociological synthesis comes\nto replace theological synthesis. Membership of Humanity is\nsociological, not biological. In order to belong to what is defined as\nthe continuous whole of convergent beings \u2014 Comte\u2019s term\nfor (mainly human) beings who tend to agree \u2014 one has to be\nworthy of it. All \u2018producers of dung\u2019 are excluded;\nconversely, animals that have rendered important services can be\nincluded. Strictly speaking, it is to sociology that one should turn\nfor knowledge of the laws of the human order but, as the final science\nrecapitulates all others, it is the whole encyclopedic scale\n(\u00e9chelle ; it is the result of the classification of\nsciences), that constitutes the doctrine of the new religion, which\nthereby becomes demonstrated and is no longer revealed or\ninspired.\n\nThe principal novelty of Comte\u2019s religion therefore resides in\nworship, which is both private (taking place within the family) and\npublic. The positivists set up a whole system of prayers, hymns, and\nsacraments (Wright 1986). As these were all largely inspired by\nCatholic worship, it was said that it was \u2018catholicism without\nChrist\u2019, to which the positivists replied that it was\n\u2018catholicism plus science\u2019. The best known and most\noriginal aspects of Comte\u2019s religion are found in its public\nworship, and in the positivist liturgical calendar. As Humanity\nconsists more of dead than living beings, positivism designed a whole\nsystem of commemorations, which were to develop the sense of\nHumanity\u2019s historical continuity. The most prominent form of the\nworship of Humanity is the worship of great men. Unlike the French\nrevolutionary calendar, which followed the rhythm of the seasons, the\npositivist calendar takes its inspiration from history and pays homage\nto great men and women from all nations and all times.\n\nUsually, when dealing with positivist religion, one focuses on the\nfeatures classically associated with religion, as we have just done.\nIt is then easy to miss one of its most original aspects, namely a\npurely sociological approach (Bourdeau 2020). From this point of view,\nthree types of societies must be distinguished: the family, the State\n(Greek polis, Latin Civitas), and the Church. The\nState is made up of families, the Church is made up of States. Each is\nbased on different ties: affective for the first, active for the\nsecond, and intellectual for the third. Each also has a different\nrelationship to space. Hence the necessity to separate the State and\nthe Church. The religious society is by its nature catholic, in the\nsense of universal, and therefore has no boundaries other than those\nof the planet; the surface of a State meets different demands, which\nimpose rather strict geographic limits. The contrast between French\npolitical history and English political history, which was a common\nplace in Comte\u2019s time (see for instance Tocqueville or Guizot;\nit is already present in Montesquieu and Voltaire) illustrates the\npoint: there is no separation of Church and State in Great Britain, in\nthat sense that the Queen is also the head of the Anglican Church.\nNevertheless, its main application is related to the issue:\ncentralization against local powers, which is another aspect of the\nspatial dimension of politics. Of the two political models constantly\nconfronted in the Course, Comte clearly prefers the French\none. Its characteristic alliance of the monarchy with the people\nagainst the aristocracy was accompanied by a centralization that the\nRevolution contented itself with consolidating. One might therefore be\nled to believe that Comte was a partisan of centralized political\n(that is: temporal) power, whereas the contrary was in fact the case,\nas he proposed to divide France into seventeen administrative regions,\nmore or less equivalent to the old provinces (1851, v. 4, 421; Vernon\n1984). Centralization applies only to the spiritual power.\n",
