Critics\nhowever have been highly skeptical that liberal eugenics proposals can\nescape the charge of being problematically eugenic. For instance,\nBennett (2008) notes that an obligation to bring to birth the best\nchildren possible can only be established by placing a lower moral\nvalue on people with disabilities and that this obligation strongly\nargues for the introduction of eugenic policies.\n\n\nKoch (2011) highlights similarities to past\neugenic policies and accuses the central theorists of hubris \u2013 even\na \u201chuckster\u2019s promise\u201d (p. 199) \u2013 in presuming not only\nthat we will be able to engineer complex traits like intelligence, but\nthat they can know the appropriate regulatory limits and speak for all\nparents. In fact, the title of one of Persson and Savulescu\u2019s\nbook \u2013 Unfit for the Future (2012) \u2013 combined\nwith its thesis regarding the need for tightened controls on liberal\nsocieties to preserve human security, makes comparisons to eugenicists\nideas about unworthy lives unavoidable. (For a chilling review of\nPersson and Savulescu\u2019s book, see Munsterhjelm 2011).\n\n\nButtressing these concerns, critics have also\ncalled attention to other potentially troubling assumptions in the\ntheoretical framework of liberal eugenics that undermine claims about\nthe differences with the old eugenics. Bennett (2008), for instance,\ncontends that an appeal to impersonal or non-person-affecting harm\ncannot get supporters of liberal eugenics out of the non-identity\nproblem without resorting to troubling social justifications. Insofar\nas the liberal eugenic project is not interested in the welfare of\nparticular people but in producing what liberal eugenicists believe is\nthe best world possible, it is difficult to see the differences with\nthe old eugenics which aimed at promoting social and not personal\ngoods.\n\n\nSo, even though advocates of liberal eugenics\nclaim to value people equally (while acknowledging that their lives can\ngo better or worse), this does not square with the idea of some worlds\nbeing morally preferable simply because they do not\ncontain people with even mild disabilities or other presumably\nundesirable traits.\n\n\nSimilarly, Sparrow (2011a) points out the profound\ntension between the consequentialist justifications favored by liberal\neugenics advocates and their assurances about the preservation of\nreproductive liberties. For example, taking Savulescu to task, Sparrow\ndraws attention to the fact that in order to address concerns about\ncolluding with unjust social norms \u2013 which Savulescu does by\nadmitting that in certain cases parents ought not choose the\n\u201cbest\u201d child for their social environment, given sexism,\nracism, etc. \u2013 Savulescu must revert to attending to social\nconsequences, rather than individual welfare.  But, this would\ncommit proponents to sacrifice the well-being of individuals for the\nsake of social goals (2011a: 35\u201336). At a minimum, this calls for\nsome justification about what social goods would trump the reproductive\nchoices of individual prospective parents and about who should be\nmaking those decisions.\n\n\nSparrow also questions the justification for the\nassumption that parents ought to have the best\nchild they could have. If we are morally obligated\nto produce the best, and if any embryos we can produce are not likely\nto rank very high relative to those of others, wouldn\u2019t there also be\nan obligation to use a donated embryo (or a clone\nof the embryo that is the best)\n(Sparrow 2011a)? To be fair, Savulescu argues that other moral reasons\ncan trump prospective parents\u2019 moral obligations to choose the\nbest child, and some degree of reproductive autonomy will surely fit\nthere. Nonetheless, the tension between parental choices and\nconsequentialist demands is difficult to escape. Moreover, as Sparrow\npoints out, even if advocates of an obligation to enhance \u2013 like\nSavulescu and Harris \u2013 deny any requirement for the government to\ncoerce individuals to participate in genetic interventions for the sake\nof enhancement, governments might still be obligated to implement\npolicies that are not strictly coercive, e.g., systems of incentives\nand targeted health campaigns. Doing so would be a form of\nstate-sponsored control \u2013 even if only through non-coercive\npressure \u2013 of reproduction, and thus much more like troubling\nold-style eugenics.\n\n\nLiberal eugenics proponents, particularly those\nwho argue for a moral obligation to use reprogenetic technologies to\nimprove our offspring, also have difficulties responding to concerns\nabout the ways in which societal norms can lead toward homogeneity,\neven without state-sponsored programs. Parents who are free to choose\ncharacteristics for their offspring may be inclined to choose\nsimilarly, either because they agree (perhaps wrongly) that those\ncharacteristics are better, or because they worry their child will be\nat a substantial disadvantage relative to other children if they choose\nwhat is unpopular (or simply fail to intervene to ensure what is\npopular). If so, societal pressures on parental choices will have\neffects similar to policies enforced by a state \u2013 homogeneity of\ntraits selected across the population (Duster 1990).   \n\n\nIndeed, some liberal eugenics proponents, aware of\nthis concern, are willing to defend restrictions on parental\nreproductive freedom (Agar 2004). But here again, such restrictions are\nproposed in the name of ensuring a social good. Thus advocates of\nliberal eugenics face a dilemma: if parents should be the ones\ndetermining the future well-being of their children, then they will\nlikely choose in ways that a) some liberals find counter-intuitive,\ni.e., choosing a Deaf child, and b) may, through market pressures and\nsocial norms, lead to homogeneity from \u201ctyranny of the\nmajority\u201d (Sparrow 2011b: 515). If, on the other hand, parents\nshould not have this leeway, if some restrictions prevent them from\nchoosing in certain ways, then reproductive decisions about improving\nour offspring fall in the hands of the state. While, as mentioned\nearlier, most advocates of liberal eugenics express concern about the\nproblem of aggregate effects of individual choices, they often end up\nseeming to dismiss them (Green 2007), presuming that education or other\nmodes of dealing with the problems will be sufficient (Savulescu 2001),\nor just adding a qualification about the need to avoid reinforcing\nunjust social norms (Agar 2004), without fully exploring the difficulty\nof doing so.\n",
