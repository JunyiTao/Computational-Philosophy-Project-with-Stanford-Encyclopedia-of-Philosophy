    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Early Du Bois: The Period of The Souls of Black Folk\n4.1 Early Du Bois: The Period of The Souls of Black Folk\n\nSouls is Du Bois\u2019s still influential answer to the\nquestion, \u201cWhat kind of politics should African Americans\nconduct to counter white supremacy?\u201d Historically rooted in the\nsegregationist era of Jim Crow, Souls authority has reached\nwell beyond its origins, so much so that its compelling ideas and\narguments continue to be taken up by contemporary theorists of black\npolitics.\n4.1.1 Uplift and Political Expressivism\n\nIn Souls, Du Bois contends that a politics fit to respond to\nthe American, Jim Crow version of racial apartheid must satisfy two\nconditions. The first relates to Du Bois\u2019s description of\nAfrican Americans as \u201cmasses:\u201d to wit, to his\ncharacterization of African Americans as an aggregate of uncultured,\npre-modern slaves or former slaves. The second relates to his\ndescription of African Americans as a \u201cfolk:\u201d that is, to\nhis characterization of African Americans as a group united by a\ncollectively shared ethos, or spirit.\n\nFor Du Bois, a politics suitable to counter Jim Crow had to uplift the\nblack masses\u2014to assimilate them to the constitutive norms of\nmodernity\u2014and to heed the ethos of the black folk. In short, it\nhad to be a politics that embraced and promoted the core values of\nmodern life while expressing the spiritual identity of the folk. Du\nBois envisions black elites\u2014the so-called \u201ctalented\ntenth\u201d (1903b)\u2014as deploying a politics of expressive\nmodernization to uplift the black masses. Elite control of black\npolitics can be authoritative and effective, he argues, only if it\nexpresses a collective spirit that unites black people.\n\nThe young Du Bois\u2019s political philosophy rests on the social\nphilosophy he outlines in \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d and\n\u201cThe Study of Negro Problems.\u201d In arguing that talented\ntenth elites could enjoy political legitimacy and efficacy only if\ntheir actions expressed a distinctive message that spiritually\ndistinguished the Negro from other spiritually distinct races and that\nunited all African Americans, he presupposes his earlier answer to the\nquestion, \u201cWhat is a Negro?\u201d In arguing that talented\ntenth elites needed to attack racial prejudice and cultural\nbackwardness alike in order to uplift and modernize the black masses,\nhe presupposes his earlier, causal analysis of Negro problems\n(Gooding-Williams, 2009, chapter 1).\n4.1.2 The Du Bois-Washington Debate\n\nDu Bois\u2019s extended critique of Booker T. Washington\u2019s\npolitical thought (see Souls, chapter 3) likewise presupposes\nhis earlier, causal analysis of Negro problems. Du Bois\u2019s\nargument immediately drew attention, for when Du Bois published\nSouls Washington had securely established himself \u201cas\nan educational statesman, the primary spokesman of black America, and\nthe leader of a large network of disciples\u2014the \u2018Tuskegee\nMachine\u2019\u2014who edited newspapers, owned businesses, and\ndirected schools modeled on Tuskegee\u201d(Blight and\nGooding-Williams, 1997, 16).\n\nWashington held that if blacks endeavored to help themselves\u2014to\ndiscipline their bodies, to cultivate entrepreneurial virtues (e.g.\nthrift, spirit of industry, and economy), and to acquire the knowledge\nof a trade\u2014they would thrive in the capitalist market and, due\nto their business success, bring an end to Jim Crow and win the\nfranchise. In short, he believed that black self-help efforts were\nsufficient to engender business success, and that business success was\nsufficient to persuade whites to extend to blacks the civil and\npolitical rights they required for incorporation into the mainstream\nof American society (Washington,\n 1901).[36]\n\nContra Washington, Du Bois argued that self-help efforts, while\nnecessary for black social progress, were not sufficient. Assuming\nthat both racial prejudice and cultural backwardness cause Negro\nproblems, Du Bois claims that a self-help politics that attends to the\nbackwardness of the Negro group itself without attacking racial\nprejudice is doomed to fail. Washington had argued that there was no\nneed to attack prejudice for the present, because self-help efforts\nthat contended with entrepreneurial-economic backwardness (for Du\nBois, a form of cultural backwardness) would suffice to defeat it. Du\nBois rejects this argument on the grounds that the persistent,\nprejudice-sustained denial of rights to blacks undermines their\nself-help efforts and prospects for business success.\nWashington\u2019s program amounts to a partial, one-sided attack on\nthe Negro problems. In Du Bois\u2019s view, black uplift and social\nprogress required that black political elites attack both prongs of\nthe Negro problem\u2014racial prejudice no less than backwardness. It\nalso required institutions of higher learning to train these elites.\nThus, Du Bois takes Washington to task for promoting an educational\nphilosophy that emphasized vocational education at the expense of\nhigher, liberal arts education (Du Bois, 1903a, chapter 3).\n4.1.3 Political Leadership and Double-Consciousness\n\nIn Souls, Du Bois sketches a biographical portrait of his\nmentor, Alexander Crummell, and a fictional portrait of a tragic hero,\nJohn Jones, to show how double-consciousness can compromise black\nelite political\n leadership.[37]\n Specifically, Du Bois represents double-consciousness as a form of\nalienation that estranges black elites from their followers, thereby\neroding their ability to promote ends expressing the collectively\nshared spirit of the black folk and undermining their legitimacy and\nefficacy as leaders (Du Bois, 1903a, chapters 1, 12\u201313;\nGooding-Williams, 2009, chapter 3).\n4.1.4 The Post-Jim Crow Inheritance of the Early Du Bois\n\nThe early Du Bois\u2019s defense of a black elite-led politics of\nexpressive modernization has exerted considerable influence on\npost-Jim Crow political philosophical appraisals of black American\npolitics. Indeed, it is all but impossible to grasp the point of those\nappraisals without taking account of their engagements, both explicit\nand implicit, with key elements of Du Bois\u2019s early political\nthought. For extended discussion of the issues central to the post-Jim\nCrow inheritance of Du Bois\u2019s early political thought, see,\nespecially, Reed, 1999 and Gooding-Williams, 2009, chapter 6.\n",
