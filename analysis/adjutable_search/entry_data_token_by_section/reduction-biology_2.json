    "main_text": "Models of (Epistemic) Reduction\n3. Models of (Epistemic) Reduction\n\nMost discussion in contemporary philosophy of science has centered on\nthe issue of\n epistemic reduction\n (rather than ontological or methodological reduction; see\nHoyningen-Huene 1989). The basic idea that the knowledge (or other\nepistemic units) pertaining to one scientific domain can be reduced to\nanother body of knowledge (or its epistemic units) has been spelled\nout in different ways. It is useful to group different approaches to\nreduction into two basic categories: (1) models of\n theory reduction,\n which maintain that a higher level theory can be logically deduced\nfrom a lower level theory, and, (2) models of\n explanatory reduction,\n which focus on whether representations of higher level features can\nbe explained by representations of lower level features, typically by\ndecomposing a higher level system into parts (Sarkar 1992).\n Models of theory reduction\n were of primary interest in post-positivist philosophy of science\nthat emerged in the 1960s and have received the most sustained\nattention (Schaffner 1993). More recently, accounts of explanatory\nreduction have been developed to remedy the inadequacies of theory\nfocused accounts, so that theory reduction has been displaced as the\ncentral issue by competing accounts of explanatory reduction (but see\nDizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010 and Sarkar 2015).\n",
