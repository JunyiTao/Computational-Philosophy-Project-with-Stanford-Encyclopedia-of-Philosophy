    "main_text": "\n\nThe notion of preference has a central role in many disciplines,\nincluding moral philosophy and decision theory. Preferences and their\nlogical properties also have a central role in rational choice theory,\na subject that in its turn permeates modern economics, as well as\nother branches of formalized social science. The notion of preference\nand the way it is analysed vary between these disciplines. A treatment\nis still lacking that takes into account the needs of all usages and\ntries to combine them in a unified approach. This entry surveys the\nmost important philosophical uses of the preference concept and\ninvestigates their compatibilities and conflicts.\n",
