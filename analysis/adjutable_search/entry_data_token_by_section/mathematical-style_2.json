    "main_text": "National styles in mathematics\n3. National styles in mathematics\n\nSomething less ambitious than the previous attempts at a general\nhistory of human cultural productions or far-reaching parallels\nbetween art and mathematics consists in a use of the notion of style\nas an historiographical category in the history of mathematics without\nparticular reference to art or other human cultural activities. If one\ngoes back to the beginning of the twentieth century, one finds that\n\u201cnational styles\u201d were often referred to for categorizing\ncertain features characterizing mathematical production that seemed to\nfall squarely within national lines. In the history of science such\ncases of \u201cnational styles\u201d have often been studied. One\nshould recall here J. Harwood\u2019s book Styles of Scientific\nThought (1993) and the contributions Nye 1986, Maienschein 1991,\nand Elwick 2007. A case of interest for mathematics is the opposition\nbetween French and German style in mathematics studied by Herbert\nMehrtens.\n\nMehrtens (1990a, 1990b, 1996) describes, in terms of styles, the\nconflict in mathematics between \u201cformalists\u201d and\n\u201clogicists\u201d on the one hand and\n\u201cintuitionists\u201d on the other hand as a battle between two\nconceptions of mathematics (see also Gray 2008 for a critical take on\nof Mehrtens\u2019s approach while emphasizing the\n\u201cmodernist\u201d transformation of mathematics). Hilbert and\nPoincar\u00e9 are used as paradigms for the sources of the\nopposition that later led to the Hilbert-Brouwer foundational debate\nin the 1920s (on the history of the Brouwer-Hilbert debate see Mancosu\n1998). Mehrtens also points out that this opposition did not\nnecessarily run along national lines as, for instance, Klein could be\nseen as close to Poincar\u00e9. Indeed, a certain internationalism\nin mathematics was dominant at the end of the nineteenth century and\nthe early part of the twentieth century. However, WWI was to change\nthe situation and gave rise to strong nationalistic conflicts. A\ncentral player in \u2018nationalizing\u2019 the opposition was\nPierre Duhem who opposed the esprit de finesse of the French\nto the esprit de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie of the Germans:\n\nTo start from clear principles\u2026then to make progress step by\nstep, patiently, painstakingly, at a pace that the rules of deductive\nlogic discipline with extreme severity: this is what German genius\nexcels at; the German esprit is essentially esprit de\ng\u00e9om\u00e9trie\u2026The Germans are geometers, they\nare not subtle [fin]; the Germans completely lack esprit\nde finesse. (Duhem 1915, 31\u201332)\n\n\nDuhem intended his model to apply to the natural sciences but also to\nmathematics. Kleinert 1978 showed that Duhem\u2019s book was only\npart of a reaction by French scientists to the 1914 declaration\n\u201cAufruf an die Kulturwelt\u201d signed by 93 prominent\nGerman intellectuals. This led to the so called \u201cKrieg der\nGeister\u201d in which the polarization between Germany and\nFrance reached the point not only of criticizing the specific ways of\nmaking use of science (say practicing science with military aims) but\nalso led to a characterization of scientific knowledge as essentially\ndetermined by national characteristics. In fact this strategy was\nbasically used by the French in criticizing \u201cLa Science\nAllemande\u201d but it will, twenty years later, be used by the\nGermans with the replacement of \u201cnational\u201d by\n\u201crassisch\u201d. The best known case is that of\n\u201cDeutsche Physik\u201d but here the focus will be on\n\u201cDeutsche Mathematik\u201d (see also Segal 2003 and\nPeckhaus 2005).\n\nThe most extreme form of this ideological confrontation, which\nironically reversed the role of Germans and French in the comparison\nused by Duhem, is found in the writings of Ludwig Bieberbach, the\nfounder of the so-called \u201cDeutsche Mathematik\u201d.\nTaking his start from the dismissal of Landau from the mathematical\nFaculty in G\u00f6ttingen, Bieberbach tried to rationalize why the\nstudents had forced Landau\u2019s dismissal. In a\nKurzreferat for his talk he summarized his aims as\nfollows:\n\nMy considerations aim at describing the influence for my own science,\nmathematics, of the people [Volkstum], of blood and race, on\nthe style of creation by using several examples. For a\nnational-socialist this requires of course no proof at all. It is\nrather an insight of great obviousness. For all our actions and\nthoughts are rooted in blood and race and receives from them their\nspecificity. That there are such styles is also familiar to every\nmathematician. (Bieberbach, 1934a, 235)\n\n\nIn his two papers 1934b and 1934c, he claimed that the mathematics\npracticed by Landau was foreign to the German spirit. He compared\nErhard Schmidt and Landau and claimed that in the first case\n\nThe system is directed towards the objects, the construction is\norganic. By contrast, Landau\u2019s style is foreign to reality,\nantagonistic to life, inorganic. The style of Erhard Schmidt is\nconcrete, intuitive and at the same time it satisfies all the logical\ndemands. (Bieberbach 1934b, 237)\n\n\nOther important oppositions brought forward by Bieberbach as\n\u201cevidence\u201d for his claims were Gauss vs. Cauchy-Goursat on\ncomplex numbers; Poincar\u00e9 vs. Maxwell in mathematical physics;\nLandau vs. Schmidt; and Jacobi vs. Klein.\n\nBy relying on the psychology of types by the notorious Marburg\npsychologist Jaensch he then went on to oppose Jewish/Latin and German\npsychological types. The fault line, so to speak, was between a\nmathematics driven by intuition, typical of German mathematics, and\nthe formalism allegedly espoused by the Jewish/Latin mathematicians.\nObviously, Bieberbach was forced to do a lot of gerrymandering to make\nsure that important German mathematicians did not end up on the wrong\nside of the equation (see what he says of Weierstrass, Euler and\nHilbert). The basis of these mathematical differences was to be found\nin racial characteristics:\n\nIn my considerations I have tried to show that in mathematical\nactivity there are issues of style and that therefore blood and race\nare influential in the way of mathematical creation. (Bieberbach\n1934c, 358\u2013359)\n\n\nThe reason for discussing Bieberbach in this context is that his case\nexemplifies an attempt at rooting the notion of style in something\nmore fundamental, such as national characteristics interpreted in\nterms of psychology and racial features. Moreover, his case is also of\ninterest as his approach to style shows how such theorizing can be put\nin the service of a twisted political program.\n\nFortunately, talk of national styles in mathematics does not have to\ncarry with it all the implications that were found in Bieberbach.\nIndeed, when historians today refer to national styles they do so\nwithout the nationalism that motivated the older contributions.\nRather, they are concerned with describing how \u201clocal\u201d\ncultures play a role in the constitution of knowledge (see also Larvor\n2016). While increased mobility and email communications make it\nharder for national styles to thrive, special political conditions\nmight also favor the persistence of such a style. This is the case,\nfor instance, of the Russian style in algebraic geometry and\nrepresentation theory. As Robert MacPherson has pointed out to the\nauthor, this case of national style would deserve a more extensive\ninvestigation and it would be interesting to study how the fall of the\nSoviet Union impacted this style. By contrast, an instance of a\nnational style that has been extensively studied is that of Italian\nstyle algebraic geometry. This case has been studied with care by a\nnumber of historians of mathematics and in particular by Aldo\nBrigaglia (see also Casnati et al. 2016). For instance in a recent\narticle, Brigaglia writes:\n\nMoreover, the Italian school was not strictly a national\n\u2018school,\u2019 but rather a working style and a methodology,\nprincipally based in Italy, but with representatives to be found\nelsewhere in the world. (Brigaglia 2001, 189)\n\n\nThe scare quotes highlight the problem of trying to grasp the\ndifference between \u2018schools\u2019, \u2018styles\u2019,\n\u2018methodologies\u2019 etc. (see Rowe 2003) There has been no\nattempt to discuss analytically the notion of \u2018national\nstyle\u2019 for the history of mathematics\u2014in any case, nothing\ncomparable to what Harwood 1993 does in the first chapter of his book.\nThe situation is also complicated by the fact that different authors\nuse different terminologies while perhaps referring to the same issue.\nFor instance, there has been much talk recently of \u2018images of\nmathematics\u2019 (Corry 2004a, 2004b, Bottazzini and Dahan\nDalmedico, 2001). In the last section, we shall return to reflect on\nthese different usages of style in the historiographical literature on\nmathematics and how they compare with those in the natural\nsciences.\n",
