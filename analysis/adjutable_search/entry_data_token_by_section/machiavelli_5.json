The Discourses on Livy: Liberty and Conflict\n\nWhile The Prince is doubtless the most widely read of his\nworks, the Discourses on the Ten Books of Titus Livy perhaps\nmost honestly expresses Machiavelli\u2019s personal political beliefs\nand commitments, in particular, his republican sympathies. The\nDiscourses certainly draw upon the same reservoir of language\nand concepts that flowed into The Prince, but the former\ntreatise leads us to draw conclusions quite different from\u2014many\nscholars have said contradictory to\u2014the latter. In particular,\nacross the two works, Machiavelli consistently and clearly\ndistinguishes between a minimal and a full conception of\n\u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201ccivil\u201d order, and thus\nconstructs a hierarchy of ends within his general account of communal\nlife. A minimal constitutional order is one in which subjects live\nsecurely (vivere sicuro), ruled by a strong\ngovernment which holds in check the aspirations of both nobility\n(grandi) and people (Popolo), but is in turn\nbalanced by other legal and institutional mechanisms. In a fully\nconstitutional regime, however, the goal of the political order is the\nfreedom of the community (vivere libero), created by\nthe active participation of, and contention between, the nobility and\nthe people (Pedull\u00e0 2011 [2018]). As Quentin Skinner (2002,\n189\u2013212) has argued, liberty forms a value that anchors\nMachiavelli\u2019s political theory and guides his evaluations of the\nworthiness of different types of regimes. Only in a republic, for\nwhich Machiavelli expresses a distinct preference, may this goal be\nattained.\n\nMachiavelli adopted this position on both pragmatic and principled\ngrounds. During his career as a secretary and diplomat in the\nFlorentine republic, he came to acquire vast experience of the inner\nworkings of French government, which became his model for the\n\u201csecure\u201d (but not free) polity. Although Machiavelli makes\nrelatively little comment about the French monarchy in The\nPrince, he devotes a great deal of attention to France in the\nDiscourses.\n\nWhy would Machiavelli effusively praise (let alone even analyze) a\nhereditary monarchy in a work supposedly designed to promote the\nsuperiority of republics? The answer stems from Machiavelli\u2019s\naim to contrast the best-case scenario of a monarchic regime with the\ninstitutions and organization of a republic. Even the most excellent\nmonarchy, in Machiavelli\u2019s view, lacks certain salient qualities\nthat are endemic to properly constituted republican government and\nthat make the latter constitution more desirable than the former.\n\nMachiavelli asserts that the greatest virtue of the French kingdom and\nits king is the dedication to law. \u201cThe kingdom of France is\nmoderated more by laws than any other kingdom of which at our time we\nhave knowledge\u201d, Machiavelli declares (Discourses CW\n314, translation revised). The explanation for this situation\nMachiavelli refers to the function of the Parlement. \u201cThe\nkingdom of France\u201d, he states,\n\nlives under laws and orders more than any other kingdom. These laws\nand orders are maintained by Parlements, notably that of Paris: by it\nthey are renewed any time it acts against a prince of the kingdom or\nin its sentences condemns the king. And up to now it has maintained\nitself by having been a persistent executor against that nobility.\n(Discourses CW 422, translation revised)\n\n\nThese passages of the Discourses suggest that Machiavelli has\ngreat admiration for the institutional arrangements that obtain in\nFrance (Nederman 2023: 52\u201355). Specifically, the French king and\nthe nobles, whose power is such that they would be able to oppress the\npopulace, are checked by the laws of the realm which are enforced by\nthe independent authority of the Parlement. Thus, opportunities for\nunbridled tyrannical conduct are largely eliminated, rendering the\nmonarchy temperate and \u201ccivil\u201d.\n\nYet such a regime, no matter how well ordered and law-abiding, remains\nincompatible with vivere libero. Discussing the\nability of a monarch to meet the people\u2019s wish for liberty,\nMachiavelli comments that\n\nas far as the \u2026 popular desire of recovering their liberty, the\nprince, not being able to satisfy them, must examine what the reasons\nare that make them desire being free. (Discourses CW 237).\n\n\nHe concludes that a few individuals want freedom simply in order to\ncommand others; these, he believes, are of sufficiently small number\nthat they can either be eradicated or bought off with honors. By\ncontrast, the vast majority of people confuse liberty with security,\nimagining that the former is identical to the latter: \u201cBut all\nthe others, who are infinite, desire liberty in order to live securely\n(vivere sicuro)\u201d (Discourses CW 237).\nAlthough the king cannot give such liberty to the masses, he can\nprovide the security that they crave:\n\nAs for the rest, for whom it is enough to live securely\n(vivere sicuro), they are easily satisfied by making\norders and laws that, along with the power of the king, comprehend\neveryone\u2019s security. And once a prince does this, and the people\nsee that he never breaks such laws, they will shortly begin to live\nsecurely (vivere sicuro) and contentedly\n(Discourses CW 237).\n\n\nMachiavelli then applies this general principle directly to the case\nof France, remarking that\n\nthe people live securely (vivere sicuro) for no\nother reason than that its kings are bound to infinite laws in which\nthe security of all their people is comprehended. (Discourses\nCW 237)\n\n\nThe law-abiding character of the French regime ensures security, but\nthat security, while desirable, ought never to be confused with\nliberty. This is the limit of monarchic rule: even the best kingdom\ncan do no better than to guarantee to its people tranquil and orderly\ngovernment.\n\nMachiavelli holds that one of the consequences of such vivere\nsicuro is the disarmament of the people. He comments that\nregardless of \u201chow great his kingdom is\u201d, the king of\nFrance \u201clives as a tributary\u201d to foreign mercenaries.\n\nThis all comes from having disarmed his people and having preferred\n\u2026 to enjoy the immediate profit of being able to plunder the\npeople and of avoiding an imaginary rather than a real danger, instead\nof doing things that would assure them and make their states\nperpetually happy. This disorder, if it produces some quiet times, is\nin time the cause of straitened circumstances, damage and irreparable\nruin (Discourses CW 410).\n\n\nA state that makes security a priority cannot afford to arm its\npopulace, for fear that the masses will employ their weapons against\nthe nobility (or perhaps the crown). Yet at the same time, such a\nregime is weakened irredeemably, since it must depend upon foreigners\nto fight on its behalf. In this sense, any government that takes\nvivere sicuro as its goal generates a passive and\nimpotent populace as an inescapable result. By definition, such a\nsociety can never be free in Machiavelli\u2019s sense of\nvivere libero, and hence is only minimally, rather\nthan completely, political or civil.\n\nConfirmation of this interpretation of the limits of monarchy for\nMachiavelli may be found in his further discussion of the disarmament\nof the people, and its effects, in The Art of War. Addressing\nthe question of whether a citizen army is to be preferred to a\nmercenary one, he insists that the liberty of a state is contingent\nupon the military preparedness of its subjects. Acknowledging that\n\u201cthe king [of France] has disarmed his people in order to be\nable to command them more easily\u201d, Machiavelli still concludes\n\u201cthat such a policy is \u2026 a defect in that kingdom, for\nfailure to attend to this matter is the one thing that makes her\nweak\u201d (Art CW 584, 586\u2013587). In his view,\nwhatever benefits may accrue to a state by denying a military role to\nthe people are of less importance than the absence of liberty that\nnecessarily accompanies such disarmament. The problem is not merely\nthat the ruler of a disarmed nation is in thrall to the military\nprowess of foreigners. More crucially, Machiavelli believes, a\nweapons-bearing citizen militia remains the ultimate assurance that\nneither the government nor some usurper will tyrannize the populace:\n\u201cSo Rome was free four hundred years and was armed; Sparta,\neight hundred; many other cities have been unarmed and free less than\nforty years\u201d (Art CW 585). Machiavelli is confident\nthat citizens will always fight for their liberty\u2014against\ninternal as well as external oppressors. Indeed, this is precisely why\nsuccessive French monarchs have left their people disarmed: they\nsought to maintain public security and order, which for them meant the\nelimination of any opportunities for their subjects to wield arms. The\nFrench regime, because it seeks security above all else (for the\npeople as well as for their rulers), cannot permit what Machiavelli\ntakes to be a primary means of promoting liberty.\n\nThe case of disarmament is an illustration of a larger difference\nbetween minimally constitutional systems such as France and fully\npolitical communities such as the Roman Republic, namely, the status\nof the classes within the society. In France, the people are entirely\npassive and the nobility is largely dependent upon the king, according\nto Machiavelli\u2019s own observations. By contrast, in a fully\ndeveloped republic such as Rome\u2019s, where the actualization of\nliberty is paramount, both the people and the nobility take an active\n(and sometimes clashing) role in self-government (McCormick 2011;\nHolman 2018). The liberty of the whole, for Machiavelli, depends upon\nthe liberty of its component parts. In his famous discussion of this\nsubject in the Discourses, he remarks,\n\nTo me those who condemn the tumults between the Nobles and the Plebs\nseem to be caviling at the very thing that was the primary cause of\nRome\u2019s retention of liberty\u2026. And they do not realize\nthat in every republic there are two different dispositions, that of\nthe people and that of the great men, and that all legislation\nfavoring liberty is brought about by their dissension\n(Discourses CW 202\u2013203).\n\n\nMachiavelli knows that he is adopting an unusual perspective here,\nsince customarily the blame for the collapse of the Roman Republic has\nbeen assigned to warring factions that eventually ripped it apart. But\nMachiavelli holds that precisely the same conflicts generated a\n\u201ccreative tension\u201d that was the source of Roman liberty.\nFor \u201cthose very tumults that so many inconsiderately\ncondemn\u201d directly generated the good laws of Rome and the\nvirtuous conduct of its citizens (Discourses CW 202).\nHence,\n\nEnmities between the people and the Senate should, therefore, be\nlooked upon as an inconvenience which it is necessary to put up with\nin order to arrive at the greatness of Rome. (Discourses CW\n211)\n\n\nMachiavelli thinks that other republican models (such as those adopted\nby Sparta or Venice) will produce weaker and less successful political\nsystems, ones that are either stagnant or prone to decay when\ncircumstances change.\n",
