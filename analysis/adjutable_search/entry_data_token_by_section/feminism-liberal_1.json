    "main_text": "Egalitarian-Liberal Feminism || Personal Autonomy\n1.1 Personal Autonomy\n1.1.1 Procedural Accounts of Personal Autonomy\n\nEgalitarian-liberal feminists hold that women should enjoy personal\nautonomy. That is, they hold that women should live lives of their own\nchoosing. Some offer \u201cprocedural\u201d accounts of personal\nautonomy (Mackenzie & Stoljar discuss these, 2000a: 13\u201319).\nThese accounts suggest that to say women should enjoy personal\nautonomy means they are entitled to a broad range of autonomy-enabling\nconditions. On this view, the women\u2019s movement should work to\nidentify and promote these conditions. Identifying these enabling\nconditions requires careful attention to the particular ways in which\nautonomy deficits are produced in diverse women\u2019s lives.\nProcedural accounts avoid judging directly the substance of\nwomen\u2019s choices or the arrangements that ensue. The following\nlist of enabling conditions is representative.\n\nBeing free of violence and the threat of violence: Violence\nand the threat of violence violate women\u2019s dignity; they make\nwomen do what others want or reduce women\u2019s sphere of activity\nto avoiding harm. In some cases violence fractures the self and takes\nfrom women their sense of self-respect (Brison 1997). The feminist\nliterature on violence against women documents the particular role\nthat violence and the threat of violence play in unfairly\ndisempowering and limiting women (Cudd 2006: 85\u2013118).\n\nHaving access to options: On the egalitarian-liberal feminist\nview, women are entitled to access to options (Alstott 2004: 52).\nWomen\u2019s access to options is frequently and unfairly restricted\ndue to economic deprivation, in particular due to the\n\u201cfeminization of poverty\u201d (Pearce 1978; see also Cudd\n2006: 119\u2013154). Other sources of unfairly reduced options for\nwomen are stereotyping and sex discrimination in education and\nemployment (Smith 2004; Rhode 1997). Such stereotyping and\ndiscrimination affect some racial, ethnic and cultural groups in\nparticularly pernicious ways. Egalitarian-liberal feminists also point\nto the way cultural homogeneity unfairly limits women\u2019s options\n(Cudd 2006: 234), for example when culture assigns identities and\nsocial roles according to sex (Okin 1989: 170ff; Alstott 2004; Meyers\n2004; Cornell 1998: x; Chambers 2008).\n\nBeing free of the limits set by patriarchal paternalistic and\nmoralistic laws and policies: Patriarchal paternalistic laws and\npolicies restrict women\u2019s options on the grounds that such\nlimits are in women\u2019s interest. Think for example of laws that\nlimit women\u2019s employment options on the grounds that taking\ncertain jobs is not in women\u2019s interest (Smith 2004).\nPatriarchal moralistic laws and policies restrict women\u2019s\noptions on the grounds that certain options should not be available to\nwomen because morality forbids women\u2019s choosing them. Think for\nexample of laws that prohibit abortion, or laws that favor certain\nkinds of sexual expression or family forms (Cornell 1998; Brake 2004).\nWelfare state programs that distinguish between the supposedly\n\u201cdeserving\u201d and \u201cundeserving\u201d poor are\nmoralistic responses to poverty among women (Folbre 1984). Together,\npatriarchal paternalistic and moralistic laws and policies steer women\ninto socially preferred ways of life. These are unfair restrictions on\nwomen\u2019s choices, on the egalitarian-liberal feminist view,\nbecause women\u2019s choices should be guided by their own sense of\ntheir self-interest and by their own values. (But see Chambers [2008:\n203\u2013231] for egalitarian-liberal feminist uses of\npaternalism.)\n\nSome emphasize the importance of internal, psychological enabling\nconditions as well, for example the ability to assess one\u2019s\nown preferences and imagine life otherwise (Meyers 2002: 168;\nCudd 2006: 234\u2013235; Mackenzie 2000). Without the ability to\nassess the preferences on the basis of which one makes choices and to\nimagine life otherwise, one can\u2019t meaningfully be said to have\noptions other than affirming the status quo (see also Chambers 2008:\n263\u20134). These internal enabling conditions are related to the\nexternal ones. Violence and the threat of violence, stereotyping and\ndiscrimination, material deprivation, and cultural homogeneity all can\nhave the effect of closing down reflection and imagination.\n\nOn this view, the women\u2019s movement should work to identify and\npromote autonomy-enabling conditions. Identifying these conditions\nrequires careful attention to the particular ways in which autonomy\ndeficits are produced in particular women\u2019s lives. On the\negalitarian-liberal feminist view, the state has an important role to\nplay in promoting these conditions (see\n \u00a71.1.4,\n \u00a71.2.1, and\n \u00a71.2.2).\n Some egalitarian-liberal feminists emphasize that there is much that\ncannot be done by the state (Cudd 2006: 223). For example, while the\nstate can refrain from blocking such endeavors, women themselves must\ndevelop new \u201calternative emancipatory imagery\u201d (Meyers\n2002: 168), and fashion new ways of being a woman and new kinds of\nrelationships through experiments in living (Cudd 2006: 234; Cornell\n1998).\n\nSome critics argue that freedom is of limited value because, even when\nenabling conditions like these are in place, women may choose limiting\nand disadvantaging social arrangements. Some point to the phenomenon\nof deformed preferences: when attractive options are limited or\narrangements unfair, people may develop preferences for those limits\nor for less than their fair share (Nussbaum 1999a: 33, 50; Cudd 2006:\n152). This phenomenon makes changing preferences through increased\nfreedom problematic and leads some feminists to reject theories that\nprioritize free choice (Yuracko 2003). Advocates of procedural\naccounts of autonomy concede that the enabling conditions do not rule\nout that a woman could choose, for example, to undergo clitorectomy\n(Meyers 2004: 213) or become a pornographic model (Cudd 2004: 58). As\nAnn Cudd explains, possibilities like these must be accepted because\nliberal feminism values freedom and thus cannot advocate direct\n\u201cpreference education\u201d (Cudd 2004: 57). Liberal feminism\nmust offer only a\n\n\ngradualist approach. Individuals and groups will make various\nexperiments in living that we cannot now precisely imagine. They\n\u2026 will sometimes go on a mistaken path. (2004: 57)\n\n\nBut they must be freed up to find their own way. As Diana Meyers\nexplains, the moral imagination of feminist theorists and activists is\nlimited (as is everyone\u2019s); they cannot know with certainty what\nsubstantive choices are compatible with personal autonomy (Meyers\n2004: 213). Moreover, one should expect autonomous lives to take\ndiverse forms in diverse cultural contexts. On this view, \u201ca\nmorally defensible and politically viable conception of autonomy for\nan era of global feminism\u201d must be agnostic about the content of\nwomen\u2019s choices as long as they do not close off autonomy (2004:\n205).\n1.1.2 Fairness in Personal Relationships\n\nSome egalitarian-liberal feminists hold that the social arrangements\nof personal life should not only be freely chosen but should be\ncharacterized by fairness or justice. Jean Hampton draws on the\ncontractualist tradition in moral and political philosophy to describe\none way in which heterosexual intimate relationships often fail to be\nfair or just (Hampton 1993). (For extended discussion of\nHampton\u2019s feminism, see Abbey 2011: 120\u2013151. For more on\nfeminist uses of contractualism, see\n \u00a71.2.1.)\n\nOn Hampton\u2019s view, a personal relationship is fair only if both\nparties to it could\n\n\nreasonably accept the distribution of costs and benefits (that is, the\ncosts and benefits that are not themselves side effects of any\naffective or duty-based tie between us) if it were the subject of an\ninformed, unforced agreement in which we think of ourselves as\nmotivated solely by self-interest. (Hampton 1993: 240)\n\n\nOf course, many women choose to enter or remain in relationships in\npart because of affective benefits; for example women often get\nsatisfaction from satisfying others or fulfilling a duty. Why set\naside these affective benefits, as Hampton recommends, when evaluating\nthe fairness of a relationship? Hampton does not set them aside out of\na conviction that a woman\u2019s affective nature is not part of her\nessential self. Nor does she set them aside out of a conviction that\nthis aspect of a woman\u2019s nature is not valuable. (For criticism\nof Hampton, see Sample 2002.) Her test sets them aside because\naffective benefits of relationships are not received from the\nother; they are benefits that flow from one\u2019s own nature (Radzik\n2005: 51). Thus while they may, and probably should, figure in a\nwoman\u2019s overall decision about whether to enter or remain in a\nparticular relationship, Hampton believes they should not figure in\nthe evaluation of a relationship\u2019s fairness. As Linda Radzik\nexplains in her defense of Hampton, a relationship is fair or just if\nthe benefits that flow from each to the other are on\npar, that is, if each gives as much as she gets (2005: 51). When one\nparty gets from the other significantly more than he gives, he is\ndenying the other her legitimate entitlement to reciprocation.\n\nThis test formalizes an important insight of the women\u2019s\nmovement: personal relationships, in particular traditional\nheterosexual relationships, are often unfair to women, indeed often\nexploit women\u2019s tendency to care about others. Injustice of this\nsort is not uncommon. Thus Hampton\u2019s test invites criticism of a\nwide swath of human social life (Sample 2002: 271). But Hampton does\nnot call on women to cease valuing others\u2019 satisfaction or the\nfulfillment of duty (Hampton 1993: 227). Instead, she calls on the\nwomen\u2019s movement to cultivate in women and men a sensitivity and\nan aversion to this kind of injustice and to develop remedies. (For an\nearly feminist articulation of this idea, see Alex Kates\nShulman\u2019s \u201cA Marriage Agreement\u201d (1970) in Shulman\n2012.)\n\nProcedural accounts of personal autonomy (see\n \u00a71.1.1)\n do not require that relationships be just in the way Hampton\nrecommends. According to procedural accounts, it is possible that a\nchoice to enter or remain in a personal relationship in which one\ngives more than she gets from the other can be autonomous. Therefore,\nthe focus should be on ensuring that women are not pressured into or\nunable to exit them.\n\nTo be sure, Hampton\u2019s account of justice in personal\nrelationships can be a resource to women and men reflecting on their\nown preferences. It invites reflection on how one\u2019s own\npreferences affect the distribution of benefits and burdens within a\nrelationship. Also, moral criticism of relationships that exploit\nwomen\u2019s preferences reminds us that relationships can be\notherwise (because ought implies can). This reminder enhances personal\nautonomy by broadening the imagination. Thus procedural accounts of\npersonal autonomy can include Hampton\u2019s test, not as definitive\nof the acceptability of social arrangements, but as a contribution to\nthe kind of reflection about the good life on which the personal\nautonomy of individuals depends.\n1.1.3 Personal Autonomy and Human Flourishing\n\nMartha Nussbaum proposes an account of the good life that has\n\n\nat its heart, a profoundly liberal idea \u2026 the idea of the\ncitizen as a free and dignified human being, a maker of choices.\n(Nussbaum 1999a: 46)\n\n\nEchoing procedural accounts of personal autonomy\n (\u00a71.1.1),\n Nussbaum explains:\n\n\nif one cares about people\u2019s powers to choose a conception of the\ngood, then one must care about the rest of the form of life that\nsupports those powers. (1999a: 45)\n\n\nBut for Nussbaum personal autonomy is merely one of the \u201cmajor\nhuman functionings\u201d (1999a: 43) which define \u201ca good human\nlife\u201d (1999a: 42). These functionings include, among other\nthings, bodily health and integrity, affiliation, and political\nparticipation (1999a: 41\u201342). To be sure, personal autonomy, or\nin Nussbaum\u2019s words \u201cpractical reason\u201d, is a good\nthat \u201csuffuses all the other functions\u201d (1999a: 44). But\npersonal autonomy is not prioritized. A good life is one in which one\nis able to enjoy all of the major human functionings, that is, to\nflourish.\n\nNussbaum\u2019s approach takes on the problem of deformed preferences\n(see\n \u00a71.1.1)\n directly. To be sure, some may choose lives that do not include the\nactual exercise of some of the functionings\u2014an ascetic may\nchoose to compromise bodily health, for example. But, Nussbaum\nexplains, one must be able to function in each of these ways.\nSocial arrangements are to be criticized if they render their\nparticipants unable to function in the valued ways regardless\nof their preferences (1999a: 50). The women\u2019s movement should\nsensitize women and men to the injustice of denying women the ability\nto function in these valued ways, identify arrangements that are\nunjust to women by paying careful attention to diverse women\u2019s\nlives, and recommend remedies. Nussbaum holds that her account is\ncompatible with global moral pluralism and thus may function as a\nfoundation for a global feminism (Nussbaum 1999a: 40).\n\nNussbaum\u2019s \u201ccapabilities approach\u201d may be compared\nwith procedural accounts of autonomy (see\n \u00a71.1.1).\n Procedural accounts suggest that the women\u2019s movement should\nwork to protect and promote women\u2019s ability to live lives of\ntheir own choosing by identifying particular autonomy deficits in\nwomen\u2019s lives and promoting the conditions that enable autonomy.\nThese approaches avoid directly judging the substance of the choices\nwomen make or the arrangements that result. They leave it to\nindividuals and groups to fashion new, diverse, non-oppressive ways of\nlife. The list of enabling conditions for personal autonomy is not\nunlike Nussbaum\u2019s list of human functionings. But advocates of\nprocedural approaches may worry that the goal of the women\u2019s\nmovement, according to the capabilities approach, is to bring to women\na particular way of life, namely one in which women can\nfunction in these ways, instead of freeing women up to find their own\nway (Cudd 2004: 50). As Drucilla Cornell, an advocate of a procedural\napproach explains, \u201csocial equality [should be] redefined so as\nto serve freedom\u201d (Cornell 1998: xii) because \u201cthere is\nnothing more fundamental for a human being\u201d (1998: 17; see also\nCudd 2004: 51\u201352). Procedural accounts of autonomy can include\nNussbaum\u2019s approach, not as definitive of the kinds of lives\nwomen should live, but as an important contribution to the kind of\nreflection on the good life on which personal autonomy depends. (There\nis a large literature on Nussbaum\u2019s liberal feminism; see for\nexample Abbey 2011: 152\u2013205; and Robeyns 2007.)\n1.1.4 Personal Autonomy and the State\n\nThere is substantial agreement among egalitarian-liberal feminists\nthat the gender system\u2014that is, inherited patriarchal traditions\nand institutions\u2014plays an important role in perpetuating morally\nobjectionable deficits in personal autonomy in women\u2019s lives and\nthat the state can and should take action to remedy them. There is\nalso substantial agreement concerning what the state should do. There\nis disagreement about some hard cases, however, that pit liberal\nvalues against one another.\n\nEgalitarian-liberal feminists agree that the state must effectively\nprotect women from violence, regardless of where that violence takes\nplace (Cudd 2006: 85\u2013118, 209; Rhode 1997: 1193\u201395). They\nalso hold that sexist paternalistic and moralistic laws and policies\nare an unjust use of state power. Such laws place control over\nwomen\u2019s lives in the hands of others and steer women into\npreferred ways of life. Laws restricting access to birth control and\nabortion are of particular import in this context because they take an\nextremely momentous choice away from women and, together with the\ncultural assignment of caregiving duties to women, steer women into\nthe social role of mother. Women must have a legal right, and\nmeaningful access, to birth control and abortion services. In\naddition, egalitarian-liberal feminists hold that the state must not\ngrant preferential treatment to particular family forms (Brake 2004:\n293; Lloyd 1995: 1328; McClain 2006: 60) which means giving gay and\nlesbian partnerships the same recognition currently available to\nheterosexuals (Brake 2012; Hartley & Watson 2010; McClain 2006:\n6). Others argue for removing marriage\u2019s privileged legal status\naltogether or treating it legally more like other associations (Case\n2006; Chambers 2017; Metz 2010).\n\nEgalitarian-liberal feminists also support laws against sex\ndiscrimination in education, employment, and public accommodations.\nAccording to egalitarian-liberal feminists, the refusal to hire or\npromote a woman or do business with her because she is a woman is a\nmorally objectionable limit on her options. So are workplaces that are\nhostile to women. Liberal feminists argue that laws prohibiting sexual\nharassment and requiring affirmative action and comparable worth\npolicies are often called for to remedy past and ongoing sex\ndiscrimination (Williams 2000: 253).\n\nEgalitarian-liberal feminists agree also that a significant source of\nwomen\u2019s reduced options is the structure of the workplace which\nassumes that workers are free of caregiving responsibilities (Okin\n1989: 176; Williams 2000). Women, and increasingly men, do not fit\nthis model. The effect of not fitting the model is dramatic. As Anne\nL. Alstott explains: \u201cCaretakers at every income level have\nfewer options than noncaretakers at the same income level\u201d\n(Alstott 2004: 97). She continues: \u201cI am worried that\nchild-rearing too dramatically contracts the options among which\nmothers can choose\u201d (2004: 23). Alstott and others argue that\nthe state must ensure that the socially essential work of providing\ncare to dependents does not unreasonably interfere with the personal\nautonomy of caregivers. Policies proposed to ensure sufficient\npersonal autonomy for caregivers include parental leave, state\nsubsidized, high quality day care, and flexible work schedules (Cudd\n2006: 228; Eichner 2021; Okin 1989: 175). Joan Williams has\nargued for legal recognition of the right to not be discriminated\nagainst in employment on the basis of one\u2019s caregiving\nresponsibilities. Williams recommends, if necessary, legal action\nalleging failure to recognize this right as an incentive to employers\nto accommodate caregivers (Williams 2000: 274). (See\n \u00a71.2.1\n for discussion of caregiving and distributive justice.)\n\nThe egalitarian-liberal feminist literature concerned with\nwomen\u2019s personal autonomy emphasizes the role the state should\nplay in protecting women from violence and discrimination; the\nimportance of ridding the law and policy of patriarchal paternalism\nand moralism; and the role the state can play in restructuring the\nworkplace, including ensuring access to childcare. Note, however, that\negalitarian-liberal feminists are egalitarian-liberals and, as such,\nhold that among the proper uses of state power is to ensure that all\nindividuals can enjoy a decent standard of living, including access to\nadequate income, education and healthcare (Eichner 2010; on a\nguaranteed minimum income, see Cudd 2006: 154; see also Stark\n2021). Egalitarian-liberals also tend to support the right to\ncollective bargaining to secure decent wages and working conditions\n(Cornell 1998: 57; Cudd 2006: 211). (For more on distributive justice,\nsee\n \u00a71.2.1.)\n\nThere is disagreement among egalitarian-liberal feminists about some\nhard cases that pit liberal values against one another. Several hard\ncases concern autonomy and the body. Consider pornography.\nEgalitarian-liberal feminists tend to reject legal limits on\npornography (Cornell 1998: 57\u201358). But some hold that arguments\nfor restricting violent pornography are not unreasonable (Laden 2003:\n148\u2013149; Watson 2019 and 2007: 469; for what such a not\nunreasonable argument might look like, see Eaton 2007) and that the\nbest arguments for freedom of expression fail to show that it should\nnot be limited (Brison 1998). Indeed some argue that violent\npornography can undermine the autonomy of viewers (Scoccia 1996) and\nthe status of women as equal citizens (Spaulding 1988\u201389; see\nalso Watson 2015). Prostitution is a similar case. Egalitarian-liberal\nfeminists tend to reject laws prohibiting prostitution and advocate,\ninstead, the legal regulation of the sex trade prioritizing\nwomen\u2019s safety and women\u2019s control over their own working\nconditions (Cornell 1998: 57; Nussbaum 1999a, 295). But some\negalitarian-liberal feminists suggest that liberal values can support\nan argument for criminalizing the purchase of sex (Watson &\nHartley 2018: 163\u2013188). Surrogate motherhood is another case\naround which there is egalitarian-liberal feminist disagreement with\nsome arguing that women have a right to sell procreative bodily\nservices (see for example Church 1997) and others raising serious\nconcerns (see for example Anderson 1990 and Satz 2010).\n\nSome hard cases concern the role of the state in family life. Family\nlife has dramatic effects on the personal autonomy of its adult\nmembers. Assuming the role of caregiver, for example, can dramatically\ncontract options. On an egalitarian-liberal feminist view, the state\nhas an interest in ensuring that family life does not undermine\nwomen\u2019s personal autonomy. Some hold that the state should\npromote justice in the family\u2014for example, the sharing of paid\nand unpaid labor by its adult members (Okin 1989: 171). Others hold\nthat the state may not be guided by a substantive ideal of family life\n(Alstott 2004: 114; see also Nussbaum 2000a: 279\u2013280; and\nWolf-Devine 2004). In response to the disadvantage and vulnerability\nto which full-time care-givers in the home are commonly exposed, some\negalitarian-liberal feminists suggest guaranteeing a non-wage-earning\nspouse one half of her wage-earning spouse\u2019s paycheck (Okin\n1989: 181). Others propose financial support for caregivers, for\nexample state-funded care-giver allowances (Alstott 2004: 75ff; Baehr\n2021; compare Eichner 2010: 77\u201380). Some warn against\ncare-giver allowances however because, if women took disproportionate\nadvantage of them\u2014which is not unlikely\u2014the gendered\ndivision of labor might be reinforced (Schouten 2021; see also\nGheaus 2008 and Gheaus & Robeyns 2011). (See\n \u00a71.2.1\n for more discussion of this issue.)\n\nGirls\u2019 participation in families is, especially in the early\nyears, nonvoluntary. The family affects the development of\ngirls\u2019 sense of self-worth as well as their preferences and the\ncapacities, like the capacity for reflection and imagination, on which\ntheir ability to live lives of their own choosing depends (Okin 1989:\n97). Egalitarian-liberal feminists hold that the state must protect\nand promote the development of autonomy capacities in children,\nespecially girls. For example they hold that child-marriage should be\nlegally prohibited (McClain 2006: 79); girls should have access to\nabortion without parental consent or notification (Rhode 1994: 1204);\ngirls must receive a formal education free of sexist stereotyping,\nincluding instruction in the legal equality of women (McClain 2006:\n81; Lloyd 1995: 1332), including autonomy-promoting sex education\n(McClain 2006: 57\u201358), and ensuring that girls are prepared to\nbe economically independent (Lloyd 1995: 1332). Beyond this, some hold\nthat girls\u2019 interest in developing autonomy capacities requires\nthat families be internally just, that is, that there be an equal\ndivision of paid and unpaid labor between adults so that families are\nnot characterized by \u201cdependence and domination\u201d (Okin\n1989: 99\u2013100; see also Follesdal 2005). Others are not convinced\nthat there is a necessary connection between this kind of justice in\nfamilies and the development of girls\u2019 autonomy capacities\n(Lloyd 1995: 1335\u20131343) and hold that the state may not be\nguided by a substantive ideal of family life (Alstott 2004: 114; see\nalso Nussbaum 2000a: 279\u2013280; and Wolf-Devine 2004). (See\n \u00a71.2.1\n for more discussion of this issue).\n1.2 Political Autonomy\n\nSome egalitarian-liberal feminists emphasize the importance of\npolitical autonomy, that is, being co-author of the conditions under\nwhich one lives. Some use contractualist political theory to argue\nthat the state should ensure that the basic structure of society\nsatisfies principles of justice that women, as well as men, could\nendorse (see\n \u00a71.2.1).\n And some argue that the democratic legitimacy of the basic conditions\nunder which citizens live depends on the inclusion of women in the\nprocesses of public deliberation and electoral politics (see\n \u00a71.2.2).\n1.2.1 Distributive Justice\n\nSome egalitarian-liberal feminists, inspired by John Rawls\u2019\ncontractualist liberal theory of justice (Rawls 1971; 1993; 2001),\nargue that the state should ensure that the basic structure of society\ndistributes the benefits and burdens of social cooperation fairly,\nthat is, in a manner that women as well as men could endorse (for\nexample Alstott 2004; Baehr 2021; Bhandary 2019; Bojer 2002;\nLloyd 1998; McClain 2006; Okin 1989; Thompson 1993; for an overview of\nfeminist responses to Rawls, see Abbey 2013a). They argue that the\nbasic structure currently distributes benefits and burdens unfairly,\nin part due to the gender system, that is, inherited patriarchal\ntraditions and institutions.\n\nAs Rawls puts it, the basic structure of society is\n\n\nthe way in which the major social institutions distribute fundamental\nrights and duties and determine the division of advantages from social\ncooperation. By major institutions I understand the political\nconstitution and the principal economic and social\narrangements.\u2026 Competitive markets and the monogamous family\n[are] examples of major social institutions.\u2026 The basic\nstructure is the primary subject of justice because its effects are so\nprofound and present from the start. The intuitive notion here is that\nthis structure contains various social positions and that men born\ninto different positions have different expectations of life\ndetermined, in part, by the political system as well as by economic\nand social circumstances. In this way the institutions of society\nfavor certain starting places over others. (Rawls 1971: 6\u20137)\n\n\nRawls argues that the fairness of the basic structure of society may\nbe assessed by asking what principles representatives of citizens\n(parties) would choose to determine the distribution of primary goods\nin society if they were behind a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d\n(Rawls 1971: 12). The veil of ignorance blocks from the parties\nknowledge of their place in society: for example their socio-economic\nstatus, religion, and sex. (Rawls does not include sex in A Theory\nof Justice (Rawls 1971), but adds it in \u201cFairness to\nGoodness\u201d (Rawls 1975: 537).) Susan Okin proposes we\n\n\ntake seriously both the notion that those behind the veil of ignorance\ndo not know what sex they are and the requirement that the family and\nthe gender system, as basic social institutions, are to be subject to\nscrutiny. (Okin 1989: 101)\n\n\nRawls argues that parties behind a veil of ignorance would choose two\nprinciples: a liberty principle providing for the \u201cmost\nextensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a\nsimilar system of liberty for all\u201d and a principle of equality\nrequiring equality of opportunity and permitting inequalities in\nwealth and income only if they are to the benefit of the least well\noff (Rawls 1971: 302\u2013303).\n\nOkin argues that the gender system violates both the liberty and\nequality of opportunity principles because by effectively assigning\nroles to citizens according to sex it circumvents citizens\u2019\n\u201cfree choice of occupation\u201d (Okin 1989: 103). On\nOkin\u2019s view, this means that in a just society \u201cgender\ncould no longer form a legitimate part of the social structure,\nwhether inside or outside the family\u201d (1989: 103). None of the\ninstitutions of the basic structure, including the family, could\nassign roles according to sex. It is common to argue that the state,\neducational institutions and workplaces should not assign roles\naccording to sex. But Okin argues that this applies to the family as\nwell. Gender blindness must play the same role in the family that it\nplays in these institutions. In Okin\u2019s words, there must be\n\u201ccongruence\u201d between the principles that govern these\ninstitutions and those that govern family life (1989: 21). That is,\nfamilies must be just.\n\nOkin offers a second argument to support the claim that families must\nbe just. Rawls explains that a society satisfying his two principles\nof justice can be stable because within it citizens develop a sense of\njustice (Rawls 1971: 453ff). For our purposes consider that citizens\nmust develop the conviction that citizens generally are due the rights\nof equal citizenship. Okin argues that when children are raised within\nunjust families, families that lack \u201cequality and\nreciprocity\u201d and are sites of \u201cdependence and\ndomination\u201d, they are not likely to develop the requisite sense\nof justice (Okin 1989: 99\u2013100; see also McClain 2006:\n73\u201384). Instead, girls and boys may grow to believe that women\nare not entitled to equal citizenship. Therefore, if the society\ngoverned by Rawls\u2019 two principles of justice is to be stable,\nfamilies must be just.\n\nSo, Okin\u2019s view is that the state may and should promote a\nparticular ideal of family life. She tells us that the state\nshould\n\n\nencourage and facilitate the equal sharing by men and women of paid\nand unpaid work, or productive and reproductive labor. (1989: 171)\n\n\nOkin discusses several measures that might contribute to ensuring that\ngender no longer forms \u201cpart of the social structure, whether\ninside or outside the family\u201d (Okin 1989: 103), including state\nsubsidized daycare, a legal entitlement to parental leave and flextime\n(1989: 176, 186), as well as autonomy-promoting public education for\nchildren (1989: 177). She also recommends protecting from\nvulnerability those women who do choose traditional roles by making\nthem legally entitled to half of their spouse\u2019s paycheck (1989:\n181). While Okin argues that what is desired is a \u201cfuture in\nwhich all will be likely to choose this mode of life\u201d\n(1989: 171, my emphasis), the fact that many people currently\ndon\u2019t choose egalitarian family life is not, for Okin, a reason\nfor the state to not take measures to promote it (1989: 172). At the\nsame time, Okin does not endorse simply any and all state involvement;\nfor example, while she thinks justice requires the 50-50 sharing of\ndomestic work, she doesn\u2019t recommend that the state enforce it\n(1989: 171) (on this issue, see Neufeld & van Schoelandt 2014: and\nBaehr 2017: 18\u201319). (There is a substantial literature on\nOkin\u2019s use of Rawls\u2019 theory of justice. See for example\nAbbey 2011; Reich & Satz 2009.)\n\nSince Okin published these arguments (1989), a substantial literature\nhas developed by other egalitarian-liberal feminists\u2014more or\nless in the Rawlsian tradition\u2014which argues that women\u2019s\nshouldering a disproportionate share of the costs of social\nreproduction is unjust. (See for example: Alstott 2004; Baehr\n2021; Barclay 2013; Bhandary 2019; Brighouse & Wright 2008;\nEichner 2010; Engster 2001, 2010; Gheaus 2009, 2012; Gheaus &\nRobeyns 2011; Gornick & Meyers 2008; Lloyd 1995, 1998; Nussbaum\n2006: 96\u2013223; Robeyns 2007; Reiheld 2015; Schouten 2017, 2019;\nStark 2021; Watson & Hartley 2018; and Wright 2008.)\nOkin\u2019s claim that the state should promote a particular,\nsubstantive ideal of family life is a central matter for discussion in\nthis literature. So, for example, while Lloyd and Alstott endorse many\nof Okin\u2019s policy proposals (Lloyd 1995: 1332; 1998: 218; Alstott\n2004), they reject her claim that the state should promote a\nparticular substantive ideal of family life (Lloyd 1995:\n1340\u20131341; Lloyd 1998: 218; McClain 2006: 78). Alstott\nwrites:\n\n\nThe egalitarian family is, even in principle, a troubling ideal.\nStrictly equal sharing seems unduly constraining, not merely because\nfamilies today deviate from the ideal, but because free people might\nwant to organize their lives differently. (Alstott 2004: 113)\n\n\nOther egalitarian-liberal feminists have voiced similar concerns. Ann\nCudd worries that state action intended to promote gender fairness and\nfoster women\u2019s autonomy could impose a homogenizing conception\nof the good life and stifle the very reinventions of self and\nexperiments in living that women\u2019s liberation requires (Cudd\n2006: 209, 223; see also Wolf-Devine 2004). Elizabeth Anderson\nwrites:\n\n\nThe plurality of conceptions of the good that are likely to survive in\na world in which the state has done all it can be reasonably and\njustly expected to do will include a host of unreasonable conceptions\nof the good, some of which may well be patriarchal. In the face of\nsuch injustices, liberals counsel feminists to redirect their claims\nfrom the state to those promulgating such unreasonable conceptions of\nthe good, and to redirect their activism from a focus on state action\nto other domains, including civil society, churches, and the family. I\nthink this counsel is wise, which is why I am a liberal feminist.\n(Anderson 2009: 131; see also 141\u2013144)\n\n\nRecent work by egalitarian-liberal feminists Lori Watson and Christie\nHartley (2018) and Gina Schouten (2019), however, may be understood as\nresponding to these concerns as it aims to establish that some state\naction to undermine the gendered division of labor and promote\negalitarian family life is both reasonable and just.\n\nThe gendered division of labor allocates to women the work of\nproviding care for individuals who cannot care for themselves or who\nrequire help doing so. A full accounting of justice in caregiving\nfocuses not only on the fairness of the distribution of caregiving\nwork but also on the needs of individuals who receive care. Some\negalitarian-liberal feminist work includes this dual focus. Asha\nBhandary argues that the whole \u201csystem of practices\u201d\nthrough which care is given and received must be subject to liberal\nevaluation with an eye to both those who provide and those who receive\ncare (Bhandary 2019: 71, quoting Rawls 1958: 169). Elizabeth Brake\nargues that doing so requires recognizing \u201cthe social bases of\ncaring relationships [as] primary goods\u201d (2012: 175). And Martha\nNussbaum argues that liberal political theory must begin with a\n\u201cpolitical conception of the person [that] holds that human\nbeings are vulnerable temporal creatures, both capable and\nneedy\u201d (Nussbaum 2006: 221). (See also the essays in Bhandary\nand Baehr (2021) on caregiving and liberalism).\n\nRawlsian political philosophy provides the framework for the bulk of\negalitarian-liberal feminist writing on distributive justice. The\nfocus of much of that writing has been to explore Rawlsian resources\nfor criticizing the role gender has and continues to play in the basic\nstructure of societies like the United States and to lay out what a\ngender just society might look like. However, as Nancy Holmstrom\nwrites (in a rather different context),\n\n\na feminism concerned only with ending the oppression women based\non gender would be a very limited version, far from the\nemancipatory vision at its core. (Holmstrom 2011: 137)\n\n\nThus we should note that although egalitarian-liberal feminists are\negalitarian-liberals, and as such hold that the state should ensure\nthat all individuals enjoy a decent standard of living, poverty has\nnot been a major focus of much egalitarian-liberal feminist work (but\nsee Bhandary 2019; Cudd 2006; Eichner 2010; Stark 2021; Watson\n& Hartley 2018: 167\u2013168, 228\u20139). Nor has much\negalitarian-liberal feminist work attended directly to the role race\nhas played and continues to play in the basic structure of societies\nlike the United States (but see Bhandary 2019; and Mills 2017).\n1.2.2 Public Deliberation and Electoral Politics\n\nSome egalitarian-liberal feminists who emphasize the importance of\npolitical autonomy\u2014that women be co-authors of the conditions\nunder which they live\u2014focus in particular on participation in\nthe processes of democratic self-determination. These processes\ninclude both political deliberation in the many arenas of public\npolitical discourse and electoral politics. Some egalitarian-liberal\nfeminists hold that the conditions under which women live lack\nlegitimacy because women are inadequately represented in these\nprocesses. They hold that this political autonomy deficit is, in large\npart, due to the \u201cgender system\u201d (Okin 1989: 89), that is,\ninherited patriarchal traditions and institutions, and that the\nwomen\u2019s movement should work to identify and remedy it.\n\nAttempts to increase women\u2019s participation in public\ndeliberation and electoral politics confront a vicious circle of\nwomen\u2019s exclusion. The gender system leads to women\u2019s\nbeing underrepresented in influential forums of public deliberation,\nincluding in elected law-making bodies. For example women have less\nfree time to engage in public deliberation because of the\ndouble-burden of paid and unpaid labor; sex stereotyping leads many to\nthink that women (especially women from particular ethnic and cultural\ngroups) are less capable of leadership than men; the behavior called\nfor in agonistic public deliberation and electoral politics is\nunderstood to be masculine; issues of particular interest to women are\nseen as personal and not political issues; and women lack power in the\nmany institutions (like churches, universities, and think tanks) that\ninfluence political debate. But when women are underrepresented in\nthese forums and law-making bodies, it is unlikely that the justice of\nthe gender system will become the subject of public conversation or\nits dismantling a target of legislative action.\n\nSome egalitarian-liberal feminists explore ways to escape this vicious\ncircle. Because women are excluded from important forums of public\ndeliberation and electoral politics in complex ways, remedies must\naddress a variety of problems. Justice in the distribution of benefits\nand burdens in society would go some way towards enabling women to\naccess forums of public debate on equal terms with men (Okin 1989:\n104). But cultural change is necessary as well if stereotypes about\nwomen\u2019s abilities are not to interfere with their participation,\nif women\u2019s needs and interests are to be understood as\nlegitimate claims on democratic power, and if men\u2019s dominance in\ninstitutions of influence is to be overcome. Seyla Benhabib argues\nthat the women\u2019s movement, along with other new social movements\nlike the gay and lesbian liberation movement, has begun this work\n(Benhabib 1992). While much of this change is cultural, the state has\na role to play. Linda McClain argues that all children must receive\ncivic education\u2014to equip them for democratic\ncitizenship\u2014including instruction in women\u2019s equality\n(McClain 2006: 81). She also argues that the state may use its\npersuasive power to put traditionally excluded issues, like violence\nagainst women or the dilemma of balancing work and family, on the\nagenda for public deliberation (2006: 78).\n\nOthers take on the vicious circle of women\u2019s exclusion by\nrecommending legal mechanisms for the inclusion of women in electoral\npolitics (see Rhode 1994: 1205\u20131208; Phillips 1991). Some\nsuggest that legal mechanisms for including those who have been\nsystematically excluded may be justified as remedies for the unjust\ndisproportionate political power enjoyed by others (Phillips 2004:\n6\u201310). Suggested mechanisms include targets or quotas for women\nand other underrepresented groups on party slates, or proportional\nrepresentation in elected bodies. Karen Green, for example, argues for\n\u201cguaranteed equal representation of both sexes in\nparliament\u201d (Green 2006). There is diversity of opinion,\nhowever, among egalitarian-liberal feminists about the justice and\nefficacy of such mechanisms (Rhode 1994: 1205; and Mansbridge\n1997).\n1.3 Justification\n\nJohn Rawls distinguishes between what he calls comprehensive and\npolitical liberal doctrines (Rawls 1993). This distinction has been of\ninterest to egalitarian-liberal feminist philosophers. (For explicit\ndiscussion of the distinction in liberal feminism, see for example\nAbbey 2007; 2011: 72\u201382, 226\u2013247; Baehr 2008; 2013;\nChambers 2008: 159\u2013201; Enslin 2003; Lloyd 1998; Neufeld 2009;\nNeufeld & Schoelandt 2014; Nussbaum 1999b: 108; 2000b: 76 fn38;\nOkin 1994; 1999: 129\u2013130; Watson & Hartley 2018.)\n\nComprehensive egalitarian-liberal feminisms are grounded in particular\nmoral doctrines. As we have seen, egalitarian-liberal feminists\ntypically claim that some social and institutional arrangements are\nunjust and that such arrangements should be remedied; some claim that\nstate power is an appropriate tool for such remediation. For example,\nand as we have seen, egalitarian-liberal feminists argue that families\nshould foster women\u2019s and girls\u2019 personal autonomy and\nthat domestic associations should distribute benefits and burdens\nfairly; and, as we have seen, some argue that state power may and\nshould be used to these ends. Comprehensive egalitarian-liberal\nfeminisms ground such claims in particular moral doctrines.\n\nAmong comprehensive liberal feminists we may count Jean Hampton, Carol\nHay, Drucilla Cornell, Ann Cudd, Susan Okin, and Clare Chambers.\nKantian moral theory serves as a foundation for Hampton\u2019s\nfeminist contractualist account of justice in personal relationships\n(Hampton 1993: 241; see Abbey 2011: 120\u2013151) (see\n \u00a71.1.2)\n and for Hay\u2019s liberal feminist theory of oppression (Hay 2013),\nas well as for Cornell\u2019s psychoanalytically informed liberal\nfeminism that focuses on the right to intimate and sexual\nself-determination (Cornell 1998: 17\u201318; 2003; see also\nThurschwell 1999: 771\u2013772). Cudd explains that her liberal\nfeminist account of oppression as harm is grounded in a\n\u201cbackground moral theory\u201d, namely\n\n\na liberal contractarian view of the sort developed by John Rawls in A\nTheory of Justice, or the more libertarian version of David\nGauthier in Morals by Agreement. (Cudd 2006: 231)\n\n\nOkin\u2019s liberal feminism draws on Rawls\u2019 A Theory of\nJustice, which Rawls himself claims is a comprehensive liberalism\n(Okin 1999: 129; Rawls 1993: xvii). (But note that Okin claims hers is\n\u201cin between\u201d comprehensive and political liberalism (Okin\n1999: 129\u2013130).) Chambers\u2019 liberal feminism\u2014which\nexplores the relationship between social construction and\nchoice\u2014may also be counted among comprehensive liberal feminisms\nas it is grounded in personal autonomy as a moral value (Chambers\n2008).\n\nPolitical liberal feminisms are accounts of how state power may and\nshould be used to feminist ends that are grounded in public political\nvalues. Public political values are not the particular values of any\none moral doctrine; they are values that are shared by the many\nreasonable comprehensive moral doctrines citizens hold (Rawls 1993:\n227\u2013230). Advocates of political liberal feminism hold that\nstate power is used justly when supported by values that are\nendorsable by all reasonable citizens.\n\nAmong political liberal feminists we may count S.A. Lloyd, Linda\nMcClain, Martha Nussbaum, Gina Schouten, Christie Hartley, Lori\nWatson, and Amy Baehr. Lloyd constructs an argument based on public\npolitical values to the conclusion that \u201cwomen\u2019s\ndisproportionate burden in social reproduction [must] be\neliminated\u201d (Lloyd 1998: 214). McClain argues that sex equality\nis a public and constitutional value (2006: 60; see also 22\u201323,\n60\u201362, and 76) which requires state opposition to relations of\nsubordination and domination in the family (2006: 62); state support\nfor autonomy in intimate matters (2006: 22); and support for the\ndevelopment of autonomy capacities in children, especially girls\n(2006: 109). Nussbaum (see\n \u00a71.1.3)\n also presents her \u201ccapabilities approach\u201d as a political,\nand not a comprehensive, liberalism. The capabilities list, Nussbaum\nargues, can be shared by citizens holding a wide variety of\ncomprehensive conceptions of the good life, and thus should be able to\nfunction as a foundation for a political liberalism (Nussbaum 2000b:\n76 fn38). Schouten argues that the political liberal value of\nreciprocity undergirds state measures to alleviate the gendered\ndivision of labor (Schouten 2019). And Watson and Hartley argue that\npublic deliberation based on shared values is incompatible with\n\u201cpervasive social hierarchies\u201d (Hartley & Watson 2010:\n8; see also Watson & Hartley 2018). As Watson puts it,\n\n\na central task of public reason arguments, in the context of social\nhierarchy and inequality, is to expose the ways in which background\nconditions (inequalities) undermine the necessary conditions for\nreasonable deliberations among citizens to occur. (Watson 2007:\n470)\n\n\nPolitical liberal feminists suggest some advantages of political\nliberal over comprehensive liberal feminism. According to S.A.\nLloyd,\n\n\nit\u2019s true that confining the argument to talk of socially\nrecognized values requires operating with one hand tied behind\none\u2019s back, so to speak. Conclusions that would be quite easy to\nreach from stronger feminist principles, or other comprehensive\nprinciples, are much harder to reach using the sparse \u2026 toolbox\n[of public reason]. (Lloyd 1998: 210)\n\n\nBut if we can reach feminist conclusions on these sparse grounds, they\nwill be much more difficult to reject. Amy Baehr suggests that\narguments to feminist ends from public political values can move the\npolitical community toward a more reasonable understanding of those\nvalues (Baehr 2013; see also Rawls 1993: 227). Comprehensive liberal\nfeminists, in turn, worry that the public political values on which\nfeminist political liberalism must rely render the latter\ninsufficiently critical of precisely those hierarchies and forms of\ndisadvantage egalitarian liberal feminism aims to criticize and\nundermine (Abbey 2007; Baehr 1996; Chambers 2008: 12, 159\u2013201;\nEnslin 2003; Hay 2013: 34\u201339; Okin 1994; see also Munoz-Darde\n1998: 347).\n1.4 Criticism\n\nEgalitarian-liberal feminism has been subject to a variety of\ncriticisms. Addressing some of these criticisms is a focus of some\negalitarian-liberal feminist work.\n\nSome reject egalitarian-liberal feminism because, they argue, feminist\ntheory must rely on a much more robust feminist ideal of the good life\nthan egalitarian-liberal feminism is able to provide (Yuracko 2003;\nJaggar 1983). Some argue that liberalism\u2019s focus on the\nindividual renders it unable to adequately conceptualize injustice to\ngroups (I. Young 1990: 18). Some argue that liberalism\u2019s focus\non distribution neglects relations of power (I. Young 1990: 37) and\nthe eroticization of domination and subordination (MacKinnon 1987;\n1989) which are the true linchpins of the gender system. Lori Watson\nand Christie Hartley\u2019s recent feminist political liberal work\nmay be profitably read as a response to worries like these as it aims\nto show how feminist political liberalism can conceptualize injustice\nto groups as a matter of relations of domination and subordination\n(Watson & Hartley 2018).\n\nCritics have focused on the role played by ideals in liberal political\nphilosophy, especially in Rawlsian liberalism. For example, Lisa\nSchwartzman argues that Rawls\u2019 ideal of the fully just society\nobscures race and sex as \u201csocial markers of inequality\u201d\n(Schwartzman 2006: 59). Charles Mills argues that a focus on\ndismantling an \u201cexisting unjust basic structure\u201d requires\na shift from\n\n\nideal theory [which] asks what justice demands in a perfectly just\nsociety\u2026[to] non-ideal theory [which] asks what justice demands\nin a society with a history of injustice. (Mills 2017: 34; see also\nPateman & Mills 2007; but compare Mills 2017: 201\u2013215)\n\n\nEgalitarian liberal feminist Asha Bhandary addresses these concerns by\ndeveloping what she calls a \u201ctwo-level contract theory\u201d\nwhich is attentive to non-ideal contexts (Bhandary 2019).\n\nSome are concerned that egalitarian-liberal feminist embrace of the\nideal of the egalitarian family effectively elevates one particular\ncomprehensive conception of the good life over the many others found\nin multicultural societies and across the globe (Shachar 2009; for\ndiscussion see Okin 1999 and Khader 2011). As we have seen\n (\u00a71.2.1)\n some egalitarian-liberal feminists eschew the ideal of the\negalitarian family and thus avoid this criticism. Some argue that an\negalitarian-liberal feminism that holds that women\u2019s\nindependence and self-sufficiency are central feminist ideals fails to\nrecognize many relational goods on which many women depend for their\nwell-being, and thus a women\u2019s movement guided by such an ideal\nmay harm many of the very women it aims to benefit (Khader 2018). Care\nethicists also raise a concern about an egalitarian-liberal feminism\nfor which independence and self-sufficiency are central ideals. They\nargue that centering such ideals obscures the fact that human beings\ncome into the world dependent upon others and that many are dependent\non others throughout their lives; this, in turn, obscures the value of\nbeing cared for and the role that caregiving plays in a good society\n(Held 1987, 2006b; Kittay 1999). Conceptualizing personal autonomy as\nrelational, and thus downplaying independence and self-sufficiency,\nhas been a focus of some recent egalitarian liberal feminist work (see\nthe end of\n \u00a71.1.1;\n see also the essays in Bhandary and Baehr (2021).)\n\nEgalitarian-liberal feminism has been subject to socialist feminist\ncritique. Nancy Fraser, for example, has issued a\n\u201cprovocation\u201d by \u201ccontending that feminism has\nentered a dangerous liaison with neoliberalism\u201d, that is, with\npolitical forces that promote largely unfettered capitalism (Fraser\n2013: 14, see also 209\u2013226). Arruzza, Bhattacharya and Fraser\nargue that a non-elite feminism, a \u201cfeminism for the 99%\u201d,\nmust eschew such a liaison (Arruzza, Bhattacharya, & Fraser 2019;\nsee also Holmstrom 2011). Egalitarian-liberal feminists have not\nfocused a great deal of attention on capitalism. But as some\negalitarian-liberals embrace \u201cliberal socialism\u201d, it is\nnot clear that egalitarian-liberal feminism couldn\u2019t do the same\n(Rawls 2001: 138; see also Edmundson 2017; Baehr 2017: 10\u201312;\nRobeyns 2012; and Stark 2021).\n\nConservative critics of egalitarian-liberal feminism argue that\nreformers can do more harm than good when they undermine the\ninstitutions and norms which, while surely offending in many ways,\nalso serve as the foundation for many people\u2019s well-being\n(Muller 1997a; see also Fox-Genovese 1996). Such conservatives worry\nabout the radical implications of egalitarian-liberal feminism, its\nwillingness to put women\u2019s autonomy ahead of institutions and\nnorms on which, they believe, many people rely for their well-being.\nWhile Ann Cudd suggests that the expansion of opportunity and equality\npromised by liberal feminism \u201cmakes us all better off\u201d\n(Cudd 2006: 237), conservatives encourage us to consider also the loss\nthat is in liberation.\n\nClassical-liberal critics of egalitarian-liberal feminism argue\nthat\n\n\nthe very arguments that rightly led to the legal reforms affecting the\nstatus of women during the 19th century militate against\nthe demands for reform from the late 20th century\nwomen\u2019s movement. (Epstein 2002: 30; see also Tomasi 2009)\n\n\nThat is, they hold that the defense of equal rights and independence\nfor women promulgated by these early feminists is incompatible with\nthe tendency of the contemporary women\u2019s movement to call on the\nstate to improve the lives of women (see\n \u00a72).\n2. Classical-Liberal Feminism\n\nIn this article the term classical-liberal feminism is used\nfor a family of doctrines that range from libertarian feminist\ndoctrines that endorse very little (if any) state power to doctrines\nthat endorse more, yet still limited state power, largely unfettered\nmarkets, and an expansive understanding of individual rights. The\ndoctrines in this family share the following. They conceive of freedom\nas freedom from coercive interference; they hold that women, as well\nas men, have a right to freedom from coercive interference due to\ntheir status as self-owners; and they hold that coercive state power\nis justified only to the extent necessary to protect the right to\nfreedom from coercive interference. Equity feminists are\nclassical-liberal feminists who hold that, in societies like the\nUnited States, the only morally significant source of oppression of\nwomen is the state. They hold that feminism\u2019s political role is\nto bring an end to laws that limit women\u2019s freedom in\nparticular, but also to laws that grant special privileges to women.\nSome equity feminists see a nonpolitical role for feminism, helping\nwomen to benefit from their freedom by developing beneficial character\ntraits or strategies for success, or navigating among their increasing\noptions. Other equity feminists are socially conservative and argue\nthat, while the state should not enforce them, traditional values\nfunction as bulwarks against state power and produce independent and\nself-restraining citizens. Cultural libertarian feminists are\nclassical-liberal feminists who hold that the culture of societies\nlike the United States is patriarchal and a significant source of\noppression of women. They hold that the patriarchal culture and the\nstate are complementary systems of oppression. Cultural libertarian\nfeminists hold that much of the oppression women suffer today is\nnoncoercive, however, and thus should not be met with state remedies\nbut with a nonviolent movement for feminist social change.\n\nClassical-liberal feminists understand themselves as heirs to the\nfirst generation of feminist political philosophers, for example Mary\nWollstonecraft, Harriet Taylor Mill, and John Stuart Mill (Taylor\n1992: 25\u201339); the first generation of feminist political\nreformers in the United States, for example the abolitionist feminists\nElizabeth Cady Stanton and Sarah Grimke (McElroy 2002a: 6\u20137));\nand the tradition of 19th century anarchist feminism which\nincludes figures such as Voltairine de Cleyre (McElroy 2002a: 8;\nPresley 2000; Presley & Sartwell 2005). Equity feminists (see\n \u00a72.2.1)\n stress the extent to which these early thinkers and activists\nidentify women\u2019s liberation with equal respect for women\u2019s\nright against coercive interference (Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth\n2001: 1\u20132). Cultural libertarian feminists (see\n \u00a72.3)\n emphasize the extent to which these thinkers and activists challenged\nboth coercive state power and the patriarchal culture (Presley 2000;\nLong & Johnson 2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n2.1 Self-Ownership and Women\u2019s Rights\n\nClassical liberalism holds that women and men are self-owners capable\nof acquiring property rights over things. As such women and men,\nequally, have the right to freedom from coercive interference with\ntheir person and property. This right to freedom from coercive\ninterference consists in, at least, rights to freedom of conscience\nand expression, freedom to control what happens to one\u2019s body,\nfreedom of association, freedom to acquire, control and transfer\nproperty, freedom of contract, as well as the right to compensation\nwhen rights are violated. The state\u2019s role is, exclusively, to\nprotect citizens from coercive interference by protecting their\nrights. Some reject even a limited state, however, holding that\nnongovernmental means of protecting rights are to be preferred.\n\nClassical-liberal feminists hold that the right to freedom from\ncoercive interference has powerful implications for women\u2019s\nlives. It implies that women have the right to freedom in intimate,\nsexual and reproductive matters. This includes sexual autonomy (the\nright to engage in sexual activity of one\u2019s choosing including\nthe buying and selling of sex (Almodovar 2002; Lehrman 1997: 23), and\nthe right to defend oneself against sexual aggression, including the\nuse of firearms (Stevens, Teufel, & Biscan 2002)); freedom of\nexpression (the right to appear in, publish, and consume pornography\nfree of censorship (McElroy 1995; Strossen 2000)); freedom of intimate\nassociation (the right to partner or enter into a private marriage\ncontract (McElroy 1991a: 20)); and reproductive freedom (the right to\nuse birth control, have an abortion (on the minority of pro-life\nlibertarians see Tabarrok 2002: 157), and buy and sell bodily\nreproductive services, for example as in surrogate motherhood (Lehrman\n1997: 22; McElroy 2002c; Paul 2002)). Freedom from interference with\nperson and property also means that women have the right to engage in\neconomic activity, entering contracts, and acquiring, controlling and\ntransferring property free of sexist state limits (Epstein 2002; Kirp,\nYudof, & Franks 1986: 204).\n\nOne way to characterize the wrong involved when states fail to\nrecognize these rights of women is as a failure to respect\nwomen\u2019s right to be treated as men\u2019s equal, or the right\nto equal treatment under the law. To be sure, classical-liberal\nfeminists hold that the law should not treat women and men\ndifferently. But this is because they believe everyone has the same\nrights, not because they believe women have a right to be treated the\nsame as men. This is clear when we note that, for classical-liberal\nfeminism, equal treatment under unjust law is not justice (McElroy\n1991a: 3).\n\nSame treatment under the law does not guarantee same outcomes.\nClassical-liberal feminists hold that women\u2019s rights are not\nviolated when citizens exercise their rights in ways that create\nunequal outcomes (Epstein 2002: 30). A woman\u2019s rights are\nviolated only when she is interfered with coercively, that is, when\nthere is, or is a threat of, forced loss of freedom, property or life\n(which does not serve as just restraint or compensation).\n2.2 Equity Feminism\n\nEquity feminism is a form of classical-liberal feminism that holds\nthat feminism\u2019s political role is simply to ensure that\neveryone\u2019s, including women\u2019s, right against coercive\ninterference is respected (Sommers 1994: 22). Wendy McElroy, an equity\nfeminist writes:\n\n\nI\u2019ve always maintained that the only reason I call myself a\nfeminist is because of [the] gov[ernment]. By which I mean, if the\ngovernment (or an anarchist defense assoc[iation]) acknowledged the\nfull equal rights of women without paternalistic protection or\noppression, I would stop writing about women\u2019s issues. (McElroy\n1998c\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nFeminism\u2019s political role involves assuring that women\u2019s\nright against coercive interference by private individuals is\nrecognized and protected by the state (for example women\u2019s right\nagainst groping on the street or rape within marriage (McElroy\n1991b)), and that women\u2019s right against coercive interference by\nthe state itself is respected. The latter means feminists should\nobject to laws that restrict women\u2019s liberty in particular (for\nexample laws that limit women\u2019s employment options (Taylor 1992:\n228)), and laws that protect women in particular (for example laws\ngranting preferential treatment to women (Paul 1989)). Equity\nfeminists suggest that this has been largely accomplished in countries\nlike the United States. Joan Kennedy Taylor explains: feminism\u2019s\n\u201cgoal of equal political liberty for women has been pretty much\nreached in the United States\u201d (Taylor 2001; see also Sommers\n1994: 274).\n2.2.1 Equity Feminism on the Oppression of Women\n\nOn the equity feminist view, the feminist slogan \u201cthe personal\nis political\u201d is accurate when the state fails to recognize\nwomen\u2019s right against coercive interference, especially in\nwomen\u2019s personal lives. So, for example, in some countries\nhusbands have legal control over their wives\u2019 persons and\nproperty. (Some equity feminists argue that the women\u2019s movement\nin Western countries should not hesitate to criticize countries in\nwhich this occurs (Sommers 2007).) But in countries like the United\nStates, where the right of women against this sort of coercive\ninterference is recognized and protected by law, equity feminists hold\nthat \u201cthe personal is no longer political\u201d (Lehrman 1997:\n5; see also 21).\n\nIf an individual or group of individuals suffers sustained and\nsystematic denial of their rights, on the equity feminist view, we may\ncall them oppressed. Women were oppressed in the United States during\nmost of its first two centuries; people of African descent were\noppressed before the dismantling of Jim Crow laws. While the culture\nof the United States supported this denial of rights, equity feminists\nhold that the oppressor was the state (McElroy 1998cc\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources),\n which refused to recognize and protect the right of women and people\nof African descent to treatment as self-owners. When the state\nrecognizes and protects this right of women and Americans of African\ndescent, they are no longer oppressed, even if the culture\ndisadvantages them. So, for example, in a discussion of whether Muslim\nwomen are oppressed, Cathy Young focuses on whether women\u2019s\nconformity with a religious tradition that subordinates them is\nenforced by law. If it is, then women are oppressed (C. Young\n2006).\n\nIf women are to be described as currently oppressed in societies like\nthe United States, on the equity feminist view, one must show that the\nstate fails to protect women, as a group, from sustained and\nsystematic rights violations. Some feminists have argued that violence\nagainst women is pervasive in societies like the United States so\nthat, even though the law recognizes women\u2019s right against it,\nthat right is insufficiently protected and thus women endure sustained\nand systematic denial of their right to bodily integrity (Dworkin\n1991). Equity feminists endeavor to refute this claim by showing that\nthe prevalence of violence against women has been exaggerated. For\nexample Rita Simon contests the claim that as many as 154 out of 1,000\nwomen have been raped. On her accounting, the number is closer to 19\nper 1,000; and \u201crape is less common than other violent\ncrimes\u201d (Simon 2002: 235). In addition, she claims, \u201cthe\ncriminal justice system does not ignore or make light of crimes\nagainst females\u201d (2002: 236). Katie Roiphe argues that date rape\nis not a significant threat to women (Roiphe 1994). Concurring with\nRoiphe, Cathy Young writes:\n\n\nwomen have sex after initial reluctance for a number of\nreasons.\u2026 [F]ear of being beaten up by their dates is rarely\nreported as one of them. (C. Young 1992)\n\n\nWomen have also been said to be oppressed because their right to be\ntreated the same as men by employers, educational institutions, and\nassociations has been violated in a sustained and systematic way. That\nis, some argue, women have been regularly denied the right to equal\naccess to opportunities because they are women. Equity feminists\ngenerally hold that no rights are violated when employers, educational\ninstitutions, public accommodations or associations discriminate\nagainst women. Nonetheless, equity feminists argue that discrimination\nagainst women is not a serious problem. Diana Furchtgott-Roth and\nChristine Stolba argue that \u201ccomplaints about systematic\neconomic discrimination against women simply do not square with the\nevidence\u201d (Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 1999: xi; see also\n2001). They argue that \u201cwomen\u2019s wages and education levels\nare closing the gap with those of men\u201d (1999: xii). In addition,\nStolba and Furchtgott-Roth claim that women have \u201csurpassed men\nin education\u201d (23; see also 23\u201343). Christina Hoff Sommers\nconcurs, arguing that, rather than failing to provide girls with an\neducation equal to that of boys, our current educational system\ndisproportionately benefits girls (Sommers 2000: 20\u201323,\n178).\n\nEquity feminists argue that the differences in outcomes between women\nand men can be explained, not by violence against women and sex\ndiscrimination, but by differences in the preferences of women and men\n(Epstein 2002: 33; Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 1999: xii). \u201cIn\nmany cases where women remain behind men, personal choices explain\noutcomes more readily than does overt discrimination\u201d (Stolba\n& Furchtgott-Roth 1999: xii). To be sure, classical-liberal\nfeminists hold that women and men are sufficiently the same that they\nhave the \u201csame political interests\u201d, in particular the\ninterest in being treated as a self-owner (McElroy 2002a:\n14\u201315). But, for some equity feminists, biological differences\nbetween the sexes largely explain the sex segregation in the workplace\nand in family roles still common in countries like the United States\n(Epstein 2002; Lehrman 1997: 5, 31).\n\nOther equity feminists think biological sex differences alone do not\nexplain this phenomenon (C. Young 2004). Women\u2019s preferences may\nreflect the effects of socialization or incentives: for example women\nmay be socialized to prefer stereotypically female roles, or the\nrewards associated with such roles for women may provide motivation\nfor women to take them up. But equity feminists hold that, because\nwomen are not legally required, or actually forced in some other way,\nto choose traditional roles, their choices are not coerced and thus\nstate remedies are inappropriate. On the equity feminist view, a law\nprohibiting women from becoming surgeons is coercive because it\nconstitutes a threat of loss of liberty or property. But if one is\nsocialized to prefer stay-at-home motherhood, or one discovers that\none prefers to stay home with children given the other real options,\none may still choose to become a surgeon without risking loss of\nliberty or property. As Stolba and Furchtgott-Roth put it (using the\nword \u201cprevents\u201d in a very strong sense): \u201cNothing\nprevents women from choosing the surgical specialty\u201d\n(Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 1999: 60; my emphasis).\n2.2.2 Feminism\u2019s Nonpolitical Role\n\nWhile equity feminists hold that feminism\u2019s political\ntask\u2014securing for women the right to freedom from coercive\ninterference\u2014is nearly completed, some equity feminists believe\nthat feminism has a nonpolitical role to play in\nwomen\u2019s personal lives. In its nonpolitical role, feminism can\nhelp women to develop character traits and strategies that will help\nthem benefit from their freedom; and it can help women to navigate\npersonally among their increasing options.\n\nKaren Lehrman writes:\n\n\nMen have typically held title to quite a few traits that women can now\nput to good use. In addition to ambition, assertiveness, and\nindependence, there\u2019s also decisiveness. (Lehrman 1997: 33; see\nalso 62)\n\n\nOther character traits emphasized by equity feminists include\n\u201cself-confidence\u201d (Stevens et al. 2002: 255), being able\nto think and argue independently (McElroy 1998a), and taking\nresponsibility for oneself (Taylor 1992: 86). Some equity feminists\nsuggest that feminism offers individual women and men the opportunity\nfor freedom from conformity with sex roles (Lehrman 1997: 6; Taylor\n1992: 23\u201324).\n\nEquity feminists recommend strategies for success for women in\neducation and employment as alternatives to state regulation. In male\ndominated fields, for example, equity feminists recommend that women\nmentor one another or organize supportive associations, making use of\nthe techniques of 1960\u2019s feminism like consciousness-raising\n(Taylor 1992: 100\u2013101). Some recommend that, instead of being\nambivalent about work outside of the home, women should \u201clean\nin\u201d to it (Sandberg 2013). In What You Can Do About Sexual\nHarassment When You Don\u2019t Want to Call the Cops, Joan\nKennedy Taylor argues that women can avoid sexual harassment or lessen\nits impact if they learn to diffuse conflicts with men and understand\nthe role of sexual banter in male culture (Taylor 1999). Equity\nfeminists also recommend that women make full use of their right to\ncontract by turning their preferences\u2014for example the preference\nfor being paid and/or promoted on the basis of one\u2019s job\nperformance and not on the basis of sexual favors\u2014into rights\nthrough contract (Epstein 2002: 40; Taylor 1992: 169).\n\nSome equity feminists stress that women need not give up their gender\ndifference to benefit from their freedom (Lehrman 1997: 198). As Karen\nLehrman writes, \u201ccompleting the feminist\nrevolution\u2026primarily involves [women] completing their own\npersonal evolutions\u201d (1997: 35). Lehrman quotes Elizabeth Cady\nStanton:\n\n\nthe strongest reason for giving woman \u2026 a complete emancipation\nfrom all forms of bondage of custom, dependence, superstition \u2026\nis the solitude and personal responsibility of her own individual\nlife. (1997: 201, quoting \u201cThe Solitude of Self\u201d\n[1892])\n\n\nAn important part of this individual life, on Lehrman\u2019s view, is\nnavigating among sexual difference and sameness in the personal\nconstruction of a satisfying life.\n2.2.3 Socially Conservative Equity Feminism\n\nSome equity feminists are socially conservative (Morse 2001; Sommers\n2000). To be sure, equity feminism as described here is a form of\nclassical-liberalism. As such it involves the claim that traditional\nvalues should not be imposed on citizens by the state. For example,\nthe state should not tax citizens to support institutions that promote\ntraditional values; nor should the criminal or civil law create\nincentives for adherence to such values. But some equity feminists\nhold that it is best when citizens voluntarily adhere to traditional\nvalues. They hold that widespread voluntary adherence to traditional\nvalues is conducive to well-being in society because traditional\nvalues make possible the reproduction of independent and\n\u201cself-restraining citizens\u201d who are \u201cthe basis of\nfree institutions, both economic and political\u201d (Morse 2001:\n161).\n\nSocially conservative equity feminists do not take the classical\nliberal theory of the limits of state power to imply endorsement of a\nlibertine cultural ethos. So, for example, while socially conservative\nequity feminists hold that the state should not force citizens to\naccept traditional family forms (because individuals have a right\nagainst such coercive interference), they hold that society should\nstrongly discourage disfavored ways of life and encourage favored ones\nthrough noncoercive, nonstate means. Socially conservative equity\nfeminists hold that when feminism strays from its political role of\nassuring equal rights and ventures into women\u2019s personal lives\nit tends to discourage in women the kinds of delayed gratification and\nself-sacrifice on which vital social institutions, like the family,\ndepend (Morse 2001: 133).\n\nTo be sure, there are political conservatives who take equity\nfeminism\u2019s claim that women and men should be treated the same\nby the law as a rule of thumb. Elizabeth Fox-Genovese is an example of\nsuch a political conservative (Fox-Genovese 1991; 1996). The\ndifference between political conservatives who embrace the equity\nfeminist account of women\u2019s equality and socially conservative\nequity feminists is that the former endorse the use of state power to\npromote traditional values while the latter do not. Also, socially\nconservative equity feminists hold that individuals\u2019 political\nrights derive from their status as self-owners (Morse 2001: 57) while\npolitical conservatives hold that citizens\u2019 political rights\nderive from their status as members of communities (Fox-Genovese 1991:\n9). In contemporary popular political discourse it is often hard to\ndistinguish these two, as they are in political coalition. To appeal\nto both classical liberal and socially conservative constituencies, on\noccasion theorists help themselves to a bit of both traditions. For\nexample, Jennifer Roback Morse identifies herself as a libertarian:\n\u201cWhen the topic is the proper relationship between the\nindividual and the state, libertarianism is pretty much the right\npath\u201d (Morse 2001: 4). But she also makes the un-libertarian and\npolitically conservative recommendation that the state should\nintervene in personal relationships by making it \u201ccostly to\ndivorce\u201d (2001: 164, see also 104, 111).\n2.3 Cultural Libertarian Feminism\n\nCultural libertarianism is a form of classical liberalism that is\n\n\nconcerned about constraints on individual freedom from government as\nwell as from traditionalist familial, religious, and community\ninstitutions\u2014the same civil institutions that conservatives see\nas necessary for ordered liberty to thrive. (C. Young 2007)\n\n\nCultural libertarian feminism holds that these institutions reflect\nthe patriarchal nature of society and oppress women. Thus cultural\nlibertarian feminism recognizes sources of women\u2019s oppression\nother than the state (Presley 2000; Long & Johnson 2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n As Charles Johnson and Roderick Long put it, patriarchal culture and\nthe state are \u201cinterlocking systems of oppression\u201d (Long\n& Johnson 2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources),\n both of which should be opposed by feminists. They explain:\n\n\nThere is nothing inconsistent or un-libertarian in holding that\nwomen\u2019s choices under patriarchal social structures can be\nsufficiently \u201cvoluntary,\u201d in the libertarian sense, to be\nentitled to immunity from coercive legislative interference, while at\nthe same time being sufficiently \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d in a\nbroader sense, to be recognized as morally problematic and as a\nlegitimate target of social activism. (Long & Johnson\n2005\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\n\nCalling this view \u201canarchist feminism\u201d, Sharon Presley\nwrites: \u201cWhat the anarchist feminists are calling for is a\nradical restructuring of society, both in its public and private\ninstitutions\u201d (Presley 2000). Such feminists hold that much of\nthe oppression women currently suffer is noncoercive, however. Laws\nagainst prostitution are coercive\u2014the state can put a violator\nin jail or force her to pay a fine. But on the cultural libertarian\nfeminist view much of the pressure to conform to gender roles is not\ncoercive. Noncoercive oppression can be resisted, although it is often\nnot easy to do so. Cultural libertarian feminists hold that\nnoncoercive oppression should not be remedied by the state (see also\nTomasi 2009). As Presley and Kinsky explain, on the cultural\nlibertarian view, to try to remedy the noncoercive oppression of women\nwith coercive state action \u201cjust changes the sort of oppression,\nnot the fact\u201d (Presley & Kinsky 1991: 78). This oppression\nshould be opposed by a nonviolent movement for feminist social\nchange.\n\nCultural libertarian feminists target the patriarchal culture by, for\nexample, developing in individuals (especially women) the ability to\nbe independent. This involves enabling individuals to resist authority\nand think for themselves (Presley 2001). Cultural libertarian\nfeminists also recommend the development of more deeply consensual\nrelationships and institutions (Heckert 2004\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources),\n relationships and institutions in which there is an equality of\nauthority (Long 2001\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n While some equity feminists (see\n \u00a71.2)\n would applaud this work, they would call it \u201cpersonal\u201d,\nreserving the term \u201cpolitical\u201d for the work of securing\nfor women their right against coercive interference. Equity feminist\nWendy McElroy writes:\n\n\nI understand that there is a cultural form of feminism and many women\nwould still fight for improved prestige or status, and I\nwouldn\u2019t criticis[e] them for doing so. It just wouldn\u2019t\ngrip me. Guess I\u2019m a political animal after all. (McElroy\n1998c\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nBut cultural libertarian feminists consider this work to be an\nintegral part of a larger political struggle for women\u2019s\nfreedom.\n2.4 Anti-Discrimination Law and Preferential Treatment\n\nClassical-liberal feminism requires same treatment of women and men\nunder just law. This means that sex discrimination by the state, for\nexample when the state functions as an employer, is impermissible\n(Block 1991: 102; Epstein 2002: 34; Warnick 2003: 1608). But\nclassical-liberal feminists oppose laws that prohibit discrimination\nagainst women by nonstate actors, for example in employment,\neducation, public accommodations, or associations (McElroy 1991b:\n22\u201323; Epstein 2002). They hold that the interaction of citizens\nshould be subject to state control only to the extent necessary to\nprotect citizens\u2019 right against coercive interference.\nBusinesses violate citizens\u2019 right against coercive interference\nif they steal from their customers or employees; associations violate\nit if they extort their members; colleges violate it if they kidnap\nstudents. But businesses do not violate this right if they refuse to\ndo business with women, pay women less for the same work, or create a\nworking environment that is hostile to them because of their sex.\nPrivate educational institutions do not violate this right if they\nrefuse to educate girls or women, offer them an inferior education, or\ncreate a learning environment that is hostile to them because of their\nsex. Business and professional associations do not violate this right\nif they refuse to admit women as members or make them feel unwelcome\nbecause of their sex.\n\nClassical-liberal feminism, as described here, clearly implies\nrejection of the legal prohibition against private discrimination in\nemployment, education, public accommodations, and associations. But in\nthe literature one finds a range of views. Some categorically reject\nany legal protection against private discrimination (Taylor 1992: 62).\nOthers accept basic protections such as those afforded in U.S. law by\nthe Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\nand Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972; but reject more\nrobust protections, such as non-remedial affirmative action or\ncomparable worth (Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 2001: 179; see also\n107\u2013108).\n\nClassical-liberal feminism holds that private businesses, educational\ninstitutions, and associations are free to give or withhold\npreferential treatment to women. But the state may not treat women\npreferentially because the state must treat citizens the same\nregardless of sex. Nor may the state require that private businesses,\neducational institutions, or associations treat women preferentially.\nThis is because, on the classical-liberal feminist view, failure to\ntreat women preferentially is not a violation of anyone\u2019s right\nagainst coercive interference. Examples of preferential treatment\nunder the law, which classical-liberal feminists oppose, include\naffirmative action in employment and education (Lehrman 1997: 25),\ncomparable worth (Paul 1989) and advantages for women in the legal\ntreatment of custody and domestic violence (Simon 2002).\n\nWhile classical-liberal feminists resist state remedies for private\ndiscrimination against women, they also hold that such discrimination\nis not currently a serious problem in countries like the United\nStates. In addition, they argue,\n\n\neven where discrimination may exist, we find little, if any, evidence\nthat expanded government intervention would serve any useful purpose.\n(Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 1999: xii)\n\n\nand speculate that freer markets would make whatever discrimination\ncurrently takes place even more rare (McElroy 2002b, 187).\n2.5 Justification\n\nMuch of the classical-liberal feminist literature, especially the\nequity feminist literature, is written for public policy and popular\naudiences, so emphasis is on policy implications rather than\nphilosophical justifications. Nonetheless, we find in the literature a\nvariety of justifications, some consequentialist and some\nnon-consequentialist.\n\nThe most common justification offered in the classical-liberal\nfeminist literature is consequentialist. This argument says that the\npolitical arrangements recommended by classical-liberalism, as\ncompared with the alternatives, will provide women with more of what\nis good for them: for example safety, income and wealth, and options.\nLiberalizing guns laws will make women safer (Stevens, et al. 2002);\nlegalizing prostitution and pornography will improve the lives of\nwomen in those trades (Almodovar 2002; Strossen 2000) and open\nopportunities for others; freer markets will root out discrimination\nagainst women and stimulate the proliferation of amenities essential\nto working women, like daycare centers (Epstein 2002: 33; Paul 2002:\n208\u2013209; Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 2001: 124, 180; Conway\n1998). Indeed, some argue that liberalizing the market will release\nsuch an \u201cexplosion of prosperity\u201d that women will not need\nhelp from a welfare state (Long 1997\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nA variety of non-consequentialist arguments are offered as well. Kirp,\nYudof, and Franks, for example, refer to Kant\u2019s categorical\nimperative and claim that treating individuals as self-owners is what\nis meant by treating individuals as ends in themselves ((Kirp, et al.\n1986: 13\u201314). Wendy McElroy grounds her thought in the natural\nlaw tradition (McElroy 1998b). Some imply a perfectionist\njustification according to which the perfection of the human being\nrequires being treated as a self-owner (Presley 2001).\n2.6 Criticism\n\nSome criticism of classical-liberal feminism addresses the\nconsequentialist argument offered in support of classical-liberal\nfeminism. The consequentialist argument says that the political\narrangements recommended by classical-liberalism, as compared with the\nalternatives, will provide women with more of what is good for them\n(see\n \u00a72.5).\n Following Ashlie Warnick, we can distinguish the claim that\nparticular liberty-restricting policies are bad for women (and that\nsome liberty-enhancing policies are good for women) from the claim\nthat all liberty-restricting policies harm women, or that a minimal\nstate (or no state) would be better for women overall (Warnick 2003).\nIt is surely possible to cite liberty-restricting policies that are\nbad for women\u2014laws limiting women\u2019s employment\noptions\u2014and thus to cite liberty-enhancing policies that are\ngood for women\u2014not having such laws. But it is also possible to\ncite liberty-restricting policies that are good for women\u2014for\nexample the legal prohibition against sex discrimination in\nemployment, education, and public accommodations (which\nclassical-liberal feminists recommend dismantling (see\n \u00a72.4)).\n Of course, if sex discrimination is rare, as some classical-liberal\nfeminists contend (see\n \u00a72.2.1),\n laws prohibiting it will not produce much benefit. But, as\negalitarian-liberal feminists Deborah Rhode and Ann Cudd argue, sex\ndiscrimination remains a significant problem (Rhode 1997: 156; Cudd\n2006: 140\u2013142). Think also of the classical-liberal feminist\nrecommendation that women and men be treated exactly the same by the\nstate (see\n \u00a72.1\n and\n \u00a72.4).\n While different treatment can stigmatize and entrench stereotypes,\nsame treatment can disadvantage women if they are not similarly\nsituated to men\u2014which, arguably, is the case (Minow 1990). So\nthe larger case\u2014that all liberty-restricting policies harm\nwomen, or that a minimal state (or no state) would be better for women\noverall\u2014has not been made convincingly (Warnick 2003). Another\nconcern about the larger case is that much of the support offered is\nspeculative, for example Roderick Long\u2019s assertion that\n\u201cthe explosion of prosperity\u201d classical liberal\narrangements would bring about \u201dwould go a long way toward\nproviding women with an economic safety net more effective than any\ngovernment welfare program\u201d (Long 1997\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nSome criticism addresses non-consequentialist arguments for\nclassical-liberal feminism. These arguments say that, regardless of\nthe consequences, women and men should be treated as self-owners with\nrights to property justly acquired and to freedom from coercive\ninterference because this is what they deserve as ends in themselves,\nbecause this is what insight into natural law teaches, or because this\nis what their perfection requires (see\n \u00a72.5).\n Critics contend that even if we concede the relevant\nclassical-liberal premises\u2014that women and men should be treated\nin ways they deserve as ends in themselves, or as natural law teaches,\nor in ways their perfection requires\u2014it does not follow that the\nstate should treat individuals merely as self-owners entitled only to\nproperty justly acquired and freedom from coercive interference. For\nexample, egalitarian-liberal feminism suggests that treating\nindividuals as ends in themselves requires legal measures to protect\nwomen\u2019s personal and political autonomy\u2014measures such as\nanti-discrimination law, workplace changes to accommodate caregiving\nresponsibilities, and adequate material means (see\n \u00a71.1.4\n and\n \u00a71.2.1).\n Since classical-liberal feminism rejects such measures,\negalitarian-liberal feminism suggests that it fails to treat women as\nends in themselves. Also, that treating individuals as ends in\nthemselves means treating them as entitled merely to protection from\ncoercive interference is plausible only if one ignores the fact of\nhuman dependency. By the fact of human dependency is meant the fact\nthat all human beings are utterly dependent on the caregiving of\nothers for many years at the start of life, that many come to need the\ncaregiving of others due to temporary or permanent disability later in\nlife, and that many require caregiving when they become infirm at the\nend of life; and also, that those who provide caregiving for those who\ncannot care for themselves become dependent on others for support\n(Kittay 1995: 10). If human beings are dependent in these ways, then\ntreating them as ends in themselves will, at least for some of the\ntime, mean something other than merely leaving them alone. Failure to\nrecognize this suggests that classical-liberal feminism assumes that\nthere is a nonpolitical \u201crealm of private life in which the\nreproductive and nurturant needs of human beings are taken care\nof\u201d (Okin 1989: 75). Such an assumption makes it impossible to\nevaluate the justice of the arrangements under which caregiving is\ngiven and received and removes from our consideration the nature of\nobligations to, and entitlements of, members of society who require\ncaregiving to survive and thrive. Some worry that one form of\nclassical liberalism\u2014libertarianism\u2014seriously\nmisunderstands the political relevance of caregiving because it\nconstrues one key caregiving arrangement, the parent-child\nrelationship, as one of ownership (see Okin 1989: 80\u201385; see\nalso Nozick 1974; Andersson 2007; and Jeske 1996). As Jennifer Roback\nMorse, herself a libertarian puts it: \u201dI think it is well to\nadmit\u2026 that our inattention to family life and community\nresponsibility has left libertarians open to the charge that we do not\ncare very much about these matters\u201d (Morse 2001: 28).",
