    "main_text": "Blair\u2019s Christian stoicism\n10. Blair\u2019s Christian stoicism\n\nSmith devotes considerable space to the Stoic virtue of self-command.\nAnother eighteenth century Scottish thinker who devotes considerable\nspace to it is Hugh Blair (1718\u20131800), minister of the High Kirk\nof St Giles in Edinburgh and first professor of rhetoric and belles\nlettres at Edinburgh University. Blair\u2019s sermons bear ample\nwitness to his interest in Stoic virtue. For example, in the sermon\n\u2018On our imperfect knowledge of a future state\u2019 he wonders\nwhy we have been left in the dark about our future state. Blair\nreplies that to see clearly into our future would have disastrous\nconsequences. We would be so spellbound by the sight that we would\nneglect the arts and labours which support social order and promote\nthe happiness of society. We are, believes Blair, in \u2018the\nchildhood of existence\u2019, being educated for immortality. The\neducation is of such a nature as to enable us to develop virtues such\nas self-control and self-denial. These are Stoic virtues, and\nBlair\u2019s sermons are full of the need to be Stoical. In his\nsermon \u2018Of the proper estimate of human life\u2019 he says:\n\u201cif we cannot control fortune, [let us] study at least to\ncontrol ourselves.\u201d Only through exercise of self- control is a\nvirtuous life possible, and only through virtue can we attain\nhappiness. He adds that the search for worldly pleasure is bound to\nend in disappointment and that that is just as well. For it is through\nthe failure of the search that we come to a realisation both of the\nessential vanity of the life we have been living and also of the need\nto turn to God and to virtue. For many, the fact of suffering is the\nstrongest argument there is against the existence of God. Blair on the\ncontrary holds that our suffering provides us with a context within\nwhich we can discover that our true nature is best realised by the\nadoption of a life-plan whose overarching principle is religious.\n",
