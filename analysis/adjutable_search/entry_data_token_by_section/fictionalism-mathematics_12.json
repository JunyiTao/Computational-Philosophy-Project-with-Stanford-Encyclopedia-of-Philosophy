    "main_text": "Objections to Fictionalism and Responses || Other Objections\n2.7 Other Objections\n\nThere are, of course, other objections to fictionalism. Probably the\nmost widely discussed is based on the claim that fictionalism is not a\ngenuinely nominalistic view because the very formulation of\nfictionalism includes statements that involve ontological commitments\nto abstract objects. It would be difficult to address this objection\nhere, though, because it takes a different form in connection with\neach different version of fictionalism, and as the foregoing\ndiscussion makes clear, there are many different versions of\nfictionalism (e.g., one can endorse either hard-road fictionalism or\neasy-road fictionalism; and both of these views can be combined with\neither formalistic fictionalism or non-formalistic fictionalism; and\nany of these views can be combined with hermeneutic fictionalism or\nrevolutionary assertional fictionalism or non-revolutionary\nassertional fictionalism; and so on). It should be noted, though, that\nseveral different defenders of fictionalism have responded to worries\nabout the nominalistic status of their own particular versions of\nfictionalism. In particular, Field (1989) defends his version of\nfictionalism against the charge that it is commits to the existence of\nspacetime points, which one might think are not\nnominalistically kosher; and Balaguer (1998a) defends his version\nagainst the charge that it (and, indeed, Field\u2019s version) are\ncommitted to the existence of stories, which would presumably\nbe abstract objects if they existed; and finally, Rosen (2001) defends\nhis view against the charge that it commits to theories and\npossible worlds. Balaguer and Rosen are both concerned with\nthe worry that ficitionalists are committed to the existence of\nsentence types, which would presumably be abstract objects.\nDaly presents a version of this worry in his (2008), and he provides a\ncounter to Balaguer\u2019s response to the worry. He also provides a\ncounter to a response that Rosen had given earlier, in his (1990).\n\nAnother objection to fictionalism (or, more precisely, to easy-road\nfictionalism) is raised by Szabo (2001). Let S be some mathematical\nsentence like \u20184 is even\u2019. Szabo argues against easy-road\nfictionalists on the grounds that if they deny that S is true but\ncontinue to use it in ways that seem indistinguishable from the ways\nthat platonists use it, then they\u2019re essentially committed to\nsaying things like \u20184 is even, but I don\u2019t believe\nit\u2019\u2014which, according to Szabo, gets them into trouble with\nrespect to Moore\u2019s paradox. \n\nFinally, Chihara (2010) raises objections to the fictionalist views of\nboth Field and Balaguer. \n",
