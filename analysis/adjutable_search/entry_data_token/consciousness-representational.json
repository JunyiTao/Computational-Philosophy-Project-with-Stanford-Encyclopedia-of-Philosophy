But only more recently has it begun\nplaying a wider role in the philosophy of mind, particularly in\ntheories of consciousness. Indeed, there are now multiple\nrepresentational theories of consciousness, corresponding to different\nuses of the term \u201cconscious,\u201d each attempting to explain\nthe corresponding phenomenon in terms of representation. More\ncautiously, each theory attempts to explain its target phenomenon in\nterms of intentionality, and assumes that intentionality is\nrepresentation.\n\nAn intentional state represents an object, real or unreal (say, Mage\nor Pegasus), and typically represents a whole state of affairs, one\nwhich may or may not actually obtain (say, that Mage wins the Kentucky\nDerby again in 2024). Like public, social cases of representation such\nas writing or mapmaking, intentional states such as beliefs have\ntruth-value; they entail or imply other beliefs; they are (it seems)\ncomposed of concepts and depend for their truth on a match between\ntheir internal structures and the way the world is; and so it is\nnatural to regard their aboutness as a matter of mental referring or\ndesignation. Sellars (1956, 1967) and Fodor (1975) argue that\nintentional states are states of a subject that have semantical\nproperties, and the existent-or-nonexistent states of affairs that are\ntheir objects are just representational contents.\n\nSo much is familiar and not very controversial. But problems of\nconsciousness are generally felt to be less tractable than matters of\nintentionality. The aim of a representationalist theory of\nconsciousness is to extend the treatment of intentionality to that of\nconsciousness, showing that if intentionality is well understood in\nrepresentational terms, then so can be the phenomena of consciousness\nin whichever sense of that fraught term.\n\nThe notions of consciousness most commonly addressed by philosophers\nare the following: (1) \u201cConscious states\u201d in the very\nspecific sense of: states whose subjects are directly, internally\naware of them. (2) Introspection and one\u2019s privileged access to\nthe internal character of one\u2019s experience itself. (3) Being in\na sensory state that has a distinctive qualitative property, such as\nthe color one experiences in having a visual experience, or the timbre\nof a heard sound. (4) The phenomenal matter of \u201cwhat it\u2019s\nlike\u201d for the subject to be in a particular mental state,\nespecially what it is like for that subject to experience a particular\nqualitative property as in (3). Block (1995) and others have used\n\u201cphenomenal consciousness\u201d for sense (4), without\ndistinguishing it from sense (3). (A further terminological\ncomplication is that some theorists, such as Dretske (1995) and Tye\n(1995), have used the expression \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to\nmean the qualitative property itself, rather than the present\nhigher-order property of that property. This entry will mainly use\n\u201cqualitative\u201d to allude to sensory qualities of the sort\nthat figure in (3), and \u201cphenomenal\u201d as applying to\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like.\u201d)\n\nFor each of the four foregoing notions of consciousness, some\nphilosophers have claimed that that type of consciousness is entirely\nor largely explicable as a kind of representing. This entry will deal\nmainly with representational theories of consciousness in senses (3)\nand (4). The leading representational approaches to (1) and (2) are\n\u201chigher-order representation\u201d theories, which divide into\n\u201cinner sense\u201d or \u201chigher-order perception\u201d\nviews, \u201cacquaintance\u201d accounts, and \u201chigher-order\nthought\u201d theories.

Qualitative Character as Representation\n\nQualitative properties and phenomenal features of mental states are\neach often called \u201cqualia\u201d (singular,\n\u201cquale\u201d). In recent philosophy of mind that term has been\nused in a number of confusingly different ways. There is a specific,\nfairly strict sense that comes to us from C.I. Lewis (1929) by way of\nGoodman (1951) (though there is plenty of room for exegetical\ndisagreement about Lewis\u2019 own usage). A quale in this sense is a\nqualitative property inhering in a sensory state: the color of an\nafter-image, or that of a more ordinary patch in one\u2019s visual\nfield; the pitch or volume or timbre of a subjectively heard sound;\nthe smell of an odor; a particular taste; the perceived texture of an\nobject encountered by touch. (The term \u201cinhering in\u201d in\nthe preceding sentence is deliberately vague, and neutral on as many\nmetaphysical issues as possible. In particular, qualia may be\nproperties of the experiences in which they inhere, or they\nmay be related to those experiences in some other way.) For reasons\nthat will become clear, we may call this sense of \u201cqualia\u201d\nthe \u201cfirst-order\u201d sense. Notice that it differs from the\nbroader and vaguer sense defined in the entry on\n qualia\n (\u201cthe introspectively accessible, phenomenal aspects of our\nmental lives\u201d), and from the much more heavily laden\nsense of Block (1990, 1995, 1996), according to which\n\u201cqualia\u201d are by stipulative definition neither functional\nnor intentional properties. To avoid further confusion, let us speak\nof sensory qualities.\n\nA sensory quality can be thought of as the distinctive property of an\napparent phenomenal individual. An \u201capparent phenomenal\nindividual\u201d is anything of the sort that Bertrand Russell would\nhave taken to be a \u201csense-datum,\u201d such as (again) a\ncolored region of one\u2019s visual field, or a heard sound or an\nexperienced smell. But it is important to see that qualities of this\nkind do not presuppose the existence of sense-data or other exotica.\nSensory fields are pervaded by such qualities both in everyday\nveridical experience and in less usual cases. In our first-order sense\nof the \u201cq\u201d-word, the latter point is the merest common\nsense, and to deny it would be to take a very radical position. Of\ncourse philosophers will immediately debate the nature of these\ncommonsensical qualities and further claims about them, but it is\ngenerally agreed that that they are introspectible,\napparently monadic or nonrelational, and describable in\nordinary English words such as \u201cgreen,\u201d\n\u201cloud,\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d (though it may be\nquestioned whether those words have just the same senses as when they\nare applied to physical objects and events).\n\nSensory qualities pose a serious problem for materialist theories of\nthe mind. For where, ontologically speaking, are they located? Suppose\nBertie is experiencing a green after-image as a result of seeing a red\nflash bulb go off; the greenness of the after-image is the quality.\nActual Russellian sense-data are immaterial individuals; so the\nmaterialist cannot admit that the greenness of the after-image is a\nproperty of an actual sense-datum. Nor is it plausible to suggest that\nthe greenness is exemplified by anything physical in the brain (if\nthere is some green physical thing in your brain, you are probably in\nbig trouble). To sharpen the problem:\n\nBertie is experiencing a green thing.\nSuppose that there is no physical green thing outside\nBertie\u2019s head. But\nThere is no physical green thing inside Bertie\u2019s head\neither.\nIf it is physical, the green thing is either outside\nBertie\u2019s head or inside it. Thus,\nThe green thing is not physical. [1,2,3,4] Thus,\nBertie\u2019s experience contains a nonphysical thing. [1,5]\nThus,\nBertie\u2019s experience is not, or not entirely, physical.\n[6]\n\n\nThis is a valid deductive argument against materialism, and its\npremises are hard to deny.\n\nThe modern representational theory of sensory qualities originates\nwith Hall (1961), Anscombe(1965) and Hintikka (1969); early adherents\ninclude Kraut (1982), Lewis (1983), Lycan (1987, 1996), Harman (1990),\nShoemaker (1994), Tye (1994, 1995, 2003a), Dretske (1995), Clark\n(2000), Byrne (2001), Crane (2001, 2003), and Thau (2002). The\nrepresentational theory is usually (though not always) an attempt to\nresolve the foregoing dilemma compatibly with materialism. According\nto the theory, sensory qualities are actually intentional contents,\nrepresented properties of represented objects. Suppose Ludwig is\nseeing a real tomato in good light, and naturally it looks red to him;\nthere is a corresponding red patch in his visual field. He is visually\nrepresenting the actual redness of the tomato, and the redness of the\n\u201cpatch\u201d is just the redness of the tomato itself. But\nsuppose George Edward is hallucinating a similar tomato, and there is\na tomato-shaped red patch in his visual field just as there is in\nLudwig\u2019s. George Edward too is representing the redness of an\nexternal, physical tomato. It is just that in his case the tomato is\nnot real; it and its redness are nonactual intentional contents. But\nthe redness is still the redness of the illusory tomato. (Note that\nthe representation going on here is good old first-order\nrepresentation of environmental features, not higher-order as in the\n\u201chigher-order representation\u201d theories of awareness.)\n\nWhat about Bertie\u2019s green after-image? On the\nrepresentationalist (sometimes \u201cintentionalist\u201d) analysis,\nfor Bertie to experience the green after-image is for Bertie to be\nvisually representing a green blob located at such-and-such a spot in\nthe room. Since in reality there is no green blob in the room with\nBertie, his visual experience is unveridical; after-images are\nillusions. The sensory quality, the greenness of the blob, is (like\nthe blob itself) a nonactual intentional content. Of course, in cases\nof veridical perception, the color and the colored object are not\nmerely intentional contents, because they actually exist, but\nthey are still intentional objects, representata.\n\nAnd that is how the representationalist resolves our dilemma. As P1\nhas it, there is a green thing that Bertie is experiencing, but it is\nnot an actual thing. That \u201cthere is\u201d is the same lenient\nnon-actualist \u201cthere is\u201d that occurs in \u201cThere is\nsomething that Bertie believes in but that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d\nand in \u201cThere is at least one mythical god that the Greeks\nworshipped but that no one worships anymore.\u201d (In defending his\nsense-data, Russell mistook a nonactual material thing for an actual\nimmaterial thing.) Thus, P5, understood as delivering an\nactual green entity, does not follow.\n\nA slightly surprising but harmless consequence of the representational\nview as formulated here is that sensory qualities\n(\u201cqualia\u201d in our strict first-order sense) are not\nthemselves properties of the experiences that present them:\nSensory qualities are represented properties of represented objects,\nand so they are only intentionally present in experiences. The\nrelevant properties of the experiences are, representing this\nquality or that. Of course, one could shift the meaning slightly and\nspeak of \u201cqualia\u201d as properties of experiences,\nidentifying them with representational features, such as the feature\nof representing this strict-sense sensory quality or that; nothing\nmuch hangs on this terminological choice. (As before, \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d properties are something else again.)\n\nMost representationalists agree that the perceptual representation of\ncolor and other sensible properties is \u201cnonconceptual\u201d in\nsome sense\u2014at least in that the qualitative representations need\nnot be easily translatable into the subject\u2019s natural language.\nOf course, some psychosemantics would be needed to explain what it is\nin virtue of which a brain item represents greenness in particular.\nDretske (1995) offers one, as does Tye (1995); both accounts are\nteleologized versions of \u201cindicator\u201d semantics.\n2. Varieties of Representationalism\n\nThe mere representation of redness does not suffice for\nsomething\u2019s looking red to a subject, much less for a sensory\nquality of red and still less for a phenomenal \u201csomething it is\nlike\u201d to experience that quality. One could say the word\n\u201cred\u201d aloud, or semaphore it from a cliff, or send it in\nMorse code, or write the French word \u201crouge\u201d on a\nblackboard, or point to a color chip. The representation must be\nspecifically a visual representation, produced by either a normal\nhuman visual system or by something functionally like one. Similar\npoints would be made for nonvisual qualities, such as subjective\nbitterness, which would require alluding to the gustatory system.\n\nThus, the representational theory of sensory qualities cannot be\npurely representational, but must appeal to some further factor, to\ndistinguish visual representations from other sorts of representations\nof redness. Dretske (1995) cites only the fact that visual\nrepresentation is sensory and what he calls \u201csystemic.\u201d\nTye (1995) requires that the representation be nonconceptual and\n\u201cpoised,\u201d though he also argues that visual\nrepresentations of color would differ from other sorts of\nrepresentations in being accompanied by further representational\ndifferences. Lycan (1996) appeals to functional role.\n2.1 Pure, Strong, and Weak Representationalism\n\nThus we may distinguish different grades of representationalism about\nsensory qualities.\n\nPure representationalism would be the view that\nrepresentation alone suffices for a sensory quality. But no one holds\nthat view, for the reason just given: representation alone is cheap\nand ubiquitous. (Lloyd (1991) and Thau (2002) perhaps come close; Thau\nsuggests that representing a certain special sort of content does\nsuffice for a sensory quality.)\n\nStrong representationalism (defended by Dretske, Tye and\nLycan) is the view that representation of a certain kind\nsuffices for a sensory quality, where the kind can be specified in\nfunctionalist or other familiar materialist terms, without recourse to\nproperties of any ontologically \u201cnew\u201d sort. (A mixed\nrepresentational-functional view is what Block (1996) calls\n\u201cquasi-representationism.\u201d) We might further contrast (a)\ntheories that appeal to functional considerations only to separate\nsensory qualities from other represented properties with (b) theories\nthat use functional considerations more ambitiously, to distinguish\nqualitatively different experiences that have the same intentional\ncontent.\n\nWeak representationalism says only that qualitative states\nnecessarily have representational content, which admission is\ncompatible with sensory qualities also necessarily involving features\nthat are ontologically \u201cnew\u201d (Block (1990, 1996), Chalmers\n(1996)). Weak representationalism has been fairly uncontroversial\n(though it would have been denied by Russell, who showed no sign of\nthinking that his sense-data represented anything, and by behaviorists\nand Wittgensteinians who are hostile to the whole idea of mental\nrepresentation). At the very least, one who rejects it must try to\nexplain why we distinguish between veridical and unveridical\nexperiences; but more recently new opponents such as Campbell (2002),\nTravis (2004), No\u00eb (2005), Brewer (2006), and Fish (2009) have\nattempted just that.\n\nThroughout the rest of this entry, unless otherwise noted,\n\u201crepresentationalism\u201d shall mean the strong\nrepresentationalist view. The mixed sort of account that Block calls\n\u201cquasi-representationism\u201d is a version of strong\nrepresentationalism, since it does rule out qualitative features that\nare both nonintentional and nonfunctional.\n\nAlso, we shall consider strong representationalism as applying to all\nsensory states, including bodily sensations as well as visual and\nother perceptions. Weak representationalism is somewhat controversial\nfor pains, itches and other sensations, since it is not obvious that\nsuch sensations represent anything at all. Accordingly, strong\nrepresentationalism will be all the less defensible for them.\n\nThere are further issues that divide strong representationalists,\ngenerating different versions of the view. One is the question, of\nwhether sensory qualities themselves, in our very specific sense,\nexhaust all of what has usually been thought of as a sensory\nstate\u2019s overall phenomenal character. Dretske and Tye maintain\nthat they do; Lycan (1998) and others argue that they do not. This\nmatter will be discussed below, in the context of what is called the\n\u201ctransparency\u201d thesis.\n2.2 Narrow and Wide Representationalism\n\nA more important division is that of \u201cnarrow\u201d vs.\n\u201cwide.\u201d In the literature on propositional attitudes\nbeginning with Putnam (1975), the representational content of an\nattitude is generally thought to be \u201cwide\u201d in that it does\nnot supervene on the contents of the subject\u2019s head; on this\nview, two molecularly indistinguishable people could have different\nbelief or desire contents, determined in part by objects in their\nrespective environments. Since according to the representational\ntheory, sensory qualities themselves are real or unreal environmental\nproperties, the theory suggests that the qualities too are wide, and\nmolecularly identical subjects could experience different qualities.\nDretske (1996) and Lycan (1996, 2001) have explicitly defended this\n\u201cphenomenal externalism,\u201d though in our present\nterminology it should be called \u201cqualitative\u201d externalism.\nSome other representationalists reject this idea and believe sensory\nqualities to be narrow, necessarily shared by molecular duplicates.\nShoemaker (1994), Horgan (2000), Kriegel (2002b), Levine (2003) and\nChalmers (2004) defend narrow representationalism. (Rey (1998) calls\nhis view \u201ca narrow representationalist account of qualitative\nexperience,\u201d but it is not an account of sensory qualities in\nthe present sense; if anything Rey favors the elimination of those\nqualities.) For some arguments on each side, see Section 4.6.\n2.3 Representational Contents\n\nWithin wide representationalism or within narrow, there may be\ndisagreement about what kinds of properties are represented. In the\nprevious section, it was assumed that the putative representata are\nenvironmental features such as the colors of physical objects. But\nothers have been suggested (Byrne (2001), Levine (2003)): e.g.,\nperceptual experience might instead represent sense-data, or\nnonexistent colorish properties that physical objects do not really\nhave. Shoemaker (1994) defends the view that a color experience\nrepresents a dispositional property, viz., the disposition to cause an\nexperience of just that type. (Kriegel (2002b) and Levine (2003)\ndefend versions of Shoemaker\u2019s view in order to keep sensory\nqualities narrow and to handle various inversion cases.) On one\ninterpretation at least, Thau (2002) posits a special sort of\nquasi-color property, distinct from but related to actual colors.\n\nNotice that even on the straightforward view that the representata are\nthe ostensible colors of physical objects, the representational theory\ndoes not presuppose color realism. It is true that we have been using\ncolor words such as \u201cgreen\u201d to mean public properties of\nphysical objects, and one could not (without circularity) explicate\nphenomenal greenness in terms of represented real-world public color\nand then turn around and construe the latter real physical greenness\nas a mere disposition to produce sensations of phenomenal greenness,\nor in any other way that presupposed phenomenal greenness. But one may\nhold an error theory of physical color, taking the colors of physical\nobjects to be ultimately illusory, and yet maintain that physical\ncolor concepts are explanatorily and/or conceptually prior to\nphenomenal ones.\n\n(There can be more general issues, in other sense modalities, of\nidentifying the relevant worldly representata. E.g., Gray (2003)\nargues that sensations of heat represent neither heat, nor\ntemperature, nor conductivity, nor energy.)\n\nChalmers (2004) calls attention to the distinction between Russellian\ncontents and Fregean contents. The former can be a singular\nproposition or a configuration of objects and their properties. Though\nthe proposition may be believed (etc.) under a mode of presentation,\nthe mode of presentation is not part of the content itself. By\ncontrast, a Fregean content includes the mode of presentation, and\ndoes not include individual objects themselves. Representationalists\nhave most often thought in Russellian terms about perceptual contents,\nbut Chalmers argues that the content of a perceptual experience is\nFregean. Because it neglects the objects themselves, the Fregean\noption would lend itself to a narrow representationalist account, if\nsuch is wanted; also, it helps to accommodate inversion examples\n(Section 4.4).\n2.4 Reductive vs. Nonreductive\n\nAs Crane (2003) and Chalmers (2004) have pointed out,\nrepresentationalism need not be reductive. One might agree with the\nstrong representationalist that sensory qualities are identical with\nintentional contents, but also contend that the latter intentional\ncontent properties cannot be characterized without reference to\nsensory qualities, so despite the identity there cannot be reduction\nwithout circularity. Maintaining in this vein that\n\u201cqualia\u201d require a special phenomenal manner of\nrepresentation and holding that that manner cannot be reduced to the\nfunctional, Chalmers defends a nonreductive representationalism.\nRepresentationalists who sympathize with the view (of, e.g., Searle\n(1990) and Siewert (1998)) that intentionality requires consciousness\nwould also be motivated to remain nonreductive. Levine (2003) argues\nthat Shoemaker\u2019s (1994) view is nonreductive, on the grounds\nthat it explicates the qualitative character of an experience in terms\nof representing a property that is in turn characterized in terms of\nexperiences having that qualitative character (Levine does not\nconsider the apparent circularity vicious). But many other\nrepresentationalists are motivated by materialism and by the desire to\nreduce sensory qualities to intentionality, holding that\nintentionality is the more materialistically tractable of the two.\n3. Arguments in Favor of the Representational Theory of Sensory Qualities\n\nThere are at least four direct arguments in favor of the\nrepresentational theory.\n3.1 The Argument from Materialism\n\nMany representationalists hold that the theory not only preserves\nmaterialism while accommodating sensory qualities, but is the only\nvery promising way of doing so. For the only viable alternative\nresolution of our Bertie dilemma seems to be belief in actual\nRussellian sense-data or at least in immaterial properties. The\nanti-materialist may not mind sense-data ontologically, but s/he will\nalso inherit the nasty epistemological problems that Russell never\nsucceeded in overcoming: If sensory experience presents us with\nsense-data and nothing but, the sense-data wall us off from whatever\nmay be the rest of reality, and we are left with a justificatory gap\nbetween our beliefs about sense-data and our beliefs about the\nexternal world.\n\nMore likely, an opponent will hold the line at property dualism, as do\nJackson (1982) and Chalmers (1996). That is quite bad enough for the\nmaterialist, but of course one who holds no brief for materialism in\nthe first place will not be convinced by the present argument.\n\nThere are still nonrepresentationalist alternatives. For example, a\nmaterialist might suggest a type-identity of Bertie\u2019s phenomenal\ngreenness with something neurophysiological, but it is not plausible\nto think that a smoothly and monadically green patch in one\u2019s\nvisual field just is a neural state or event in one\u2019s\nbrain. At best, the type-identity theorist would have to do away with\nthe important claim that greenness itself, rather than some surrogate\nproperty, figures in Bertie\u2019s experience; the suggestion would\nbe an error theory, and would have to explain away the intuition that,\nwhatever the ultimate ontology, Bertie really is experiencing an\ninstance of greenness.\n\nTwo further alternate materialist treatments of sensory qualities are\nan \u201cadverbial\u201d theory of the sort recommended by Chisholm\n(1957) and Sellars (1967), and outright eliminativism.\n\nAccording to the adverbial theory, Bertie\u2019s experience involves\nno thing, either actual or nonactual, that is green. Rather, Bertie\nsenses greenly, greenly-sensing being just a type of visual\nsensing. Our main question, \u201cWhere, ontologically, is the green\nthing?,\u201d thus has a false presupposition and there is no\nproblem. Adverbialism dominated materialists\u2019 thinking for so\nlong that the latter question was hardly ever raised. But (as was not\noften noticed), adverbialism is a semantical thesis about the logical\nforms of sensation statements, and as such it has been severely and\ntellingly criticized, e.g., by Jackson (1977), Butchvarov (1980) and\nLycan (1987).\n\nEliminativism about sensory qualities is suggested if not championed\nby Dennett (1991) and by Rey (1983, 1998). But if Bertie or anyone\nelse says, \u201cI am visually experiencing greenness,\u201d it is\nhard either to call that person a liar or to explain how s/he could be\nsubject to so massive a delusion. (Levine (2001) discusses\neliminativism at more length.)\n\nDretske (1996) maintains that there is nothing intrinsic to the brain\nthat constitutes the difference between a red quality and a green one.\nUnless there are Russellian sense-data or at least immaterial\nproperties, what distinguishes the two qualities must be relational,\nand the only obvious candidate is, representing red or green.\nBut as before, if one has no objection to sense-data or immaterial\nproperties, one will be unmoved. The neurophysiological type-identity\ntheorist would protest here too, though the same rejoinders apply. A\nless commissive objection is that, contra Dretske, there are candidate\nrelations besides that of representing: some wide functional relation,\nperhaps, or a typical-cause relation (where neither of these is itself\ntaken to constitute representing).\n3.2. The Argument from Veridicality\n\nWe distinguish between veridical and nonveridical visual experiences.\nHow so? It is fairly uncontentious that Bertie\u2019s experience is\nas of a green blob and has greenness as an intentional object, and\nthat what the experience reports is false. That is hard to dispute. If\none instead accepts Russellian sense-data, and thinks of the\nafter-image itself as an actually and independently existing\nindividual\u2014indeed one of the world\u2019s basic building\nblocks\u2014one then need not also think of it as representational.\nBut one will then have to give an oblique account of the notion of\nveridicality. If one joins Campbell (2002) et al. in rejecting\nperceptual representation entirely, one will still have to reconstruct\nveridicality in some ad hoc way.\n\nThe representationalist further argues that the experience\u2019s\nveridicality condition, i.e., there being a green blob where there\nseems to Bertie to be one, seems to exhaust not only its\nrepresentational content but its qualitative content. Once the\ngreenness has already been accounted for, what qualitative\ncontent is left?\n\nSince weak representationalism does not entail strong, opponents may\noffer serious nonrhetorical answers to the argument\u2019s concluding\nrhetorical question. For example, Block (1996) maintains that Bertie\ncould introspect a certain qualitative property in addition to the\ngreenness of the after-image. And we shall definitely encounter a\nfurther kind of content in Section 4.5 below, that may or may not be\nthe same sort of property Block has in mind.\n3.3 The Argument from Transparency\n\nHarman (1990) offers the transparency argument: We normally \u201csee\nright through\u201d perceptual states to external objects and do not\neven notice that we are in perceptual states; the properties\nwe are aware of in perception are attributed to the objects perceived.\n\u201cLook at a tree and try to turn your attention to intrinsic\nfeatures of your visual experience. I predict you will find that the\nonly features there to turn your attention to will be features of the\npresented tree, including relational features of the tree \u2018from\nhere\u2019\u201d (p. 39). Tye (1995) and Crane (2003) extend this\nargument to bodily sensations such as pain.\n\nThe transparency argument can be extended also to the purely\nhallucinatory case. Suppose you are looking at a real, richly red\ntomato in good light. Suppose also that you then hallucinate a second,\nidentical tomato to the right of the real one. (You may be aware that\nthe second tomato is not real.) Phenomenally, the relevant two sectors\nof your visual field are just the same; the appearances are just the\nsame in structure. The redness involved in the second-tomato\nappearance is exactly the same property as is involved in the first.\nBut if we agree that the redness perceived in the real tomato is just\nthe redness of the tomato itself, then the redness perceived in the\nhallucinated tomato\u2014the red quality involved in the\nsecond-tomato appearance\u2014is just the redness of the hallucinated\ntomato itself.\n\nThe appeal to transparency makes it immensely plausible that visual\nexperience represents external objects and their apparent properties.\nBut as noted above, that weak representationalist thesis is not\nterribly controversial. What the transparency argument as it stands\ndoes not show, but only claims, is that experience has no other\nproperties that pose problems for materialism. The argument needs to\nbe filled out, and typically is filled out by a further appeal to\nintrospection. The obvious additional premises are: (i) If a\nperceptual state has relevant mental properties in addition to its\nrepresentational properties, they are introspectible. But (ii) not\neven the most determined introspection ever reveals any such\nadditional properties.\n\n(ii) is the transparency thesis proper. (Kind (2003) calls it\n\u201cstrong transparency\u201d and usefully distinguishes it from\nweaker claims, such as that we are very hard put to introspect\nadditional properties or that we only rarely or abnormally do.)\nTransparency is vigorously defended by Tye (1995, 2002) and by Crane\n(2003). Dretske (2003) endorses a radical version of it: that we\ncannot introspect anything about a perceptual experience, if\n\u201cintrospect\u201d has its usual meaning of internally attending\nto the experience.\n\nObjections to the transparency thesis typically take the form of\ncounterexamples, mental features of our experiences that can be\nintrospected but allegedly are nonrepresentational. Harman (1990) and\nBlock (1996) speak of \u201cmental paint,\u201d alluding to\nintrospectible intrinsic features of a perceptual representation in\nvirtue of which it represents what it does. Harman precisely denies\nthe existence of mental paint, but Block holds that, in particular, he\ncan introspect the nonintentional, nonfunctional items that he calls\n\u201cqualia\u201d in a sense quite different from that of sensory\nqualities. Loar (2003) grants that vision is normally transparent, but\nargues that we can therapeutically adopt what he calls the\n\u201cperspective of oblique reflection,\u201d perform a certain\nimaginative exercise, and thereby come to detect \u201cqualia\u201d\nin something like Block\u2019s heavily laden sense of that term.\n\nBlock further mentions bodily sensations and moods whose\nrepresentational contents are minimal but which are vividly\nintrospectible. Lycan (1998) argues on similar grounds that the\nqualities inhering in a sensory experience are only part of that\nexperience\u2019s \u201coverall feel\u201d or phenomenal character\nin sense (4). Kriegel (2017) adds that, in particular, sensory\nexperiences have affective components that are part of the mode or\nmanner of representing rather than of the representatum.\n\nTurning back to perception, Block notes that if one\u2019s vision is\nblurry, one can introspect the blurriness as well as the visual\nrepresentata. (More on blurriness in Section 4.5.2 below.) The point\nmay also be made that the vividness of a perception, say of color, can\nbe introspected over and above the sensed content, but Bourget (2017b)\noffers to explain vividness in terms of representata.\n\nA more straightforward objection to transparency is that in perceptual\nexperience, we can introspect the relevant sense modality in addition\nto the content, i.e., whether the representatum is sensed visually,\naurally, olfactorily, or whatever. It may be claimed, as by Lycan\n(1996), that those differences are functional only. However, Tye\n(2002) has maintained that they can be captured in terms of\nrepresentational contents. Moreover, Bourget (2017a) argues in some\ndetail that only by individuating the sense modalities in terms of\ncontents can we give the best account of \u201cmultimodal\u201d or\nmulti-sensory experiences, ones which unify distinct sub-experiences\noccurring in different modalities, such as those of drinking a cup of\ncoffee or encountering a barking dog. (Related arguments had been made\nby Tye (2007) and Speaks (2015).)\n\nFinally, it would seem that for any sensory quality, one can\nintrospect the higher-order property of what it is like to experience\nthat quality (cf. notion (4) listed in the fourth paragraph of this\nentry). Indeed, doing that seems to be one of introspection\u2019s\nstandard tasks.\n\nThese apparent counterexamples take a lot of overcoming. Tye (2003a)\naddresses some of them, arguing in each case that what appears to be a\nnonrepresentational difference between two experiences is actually a\ndifference in representata.\n\nAs representationalism has been defined here, it does not require the\ntransparency thesis. Representationalism itself is a claim only about\nsensory qualities, while transparency is about features of experience\nmore generally. Even if transparency fails and there are\nintrospectible nonrepresentational features of experiences, those\nfeatures are presumably not sensory qualities. (Though some of the\nforegoing examples have also been used against representationalism;\nsee Section 4.) Of course, if representationalism should be construed\nas applying to features of experience more broadly, then the existence\nof some such features may be troublesome for the view so construed;\nbut they may be acceptable to the materialist, e.g., because they are\nfunctional.\n3.4 The Argument from Seeming\n\nByrne (2001) and Thau (2002) appeal to the notion of the way the world\nseems to a subject. Very briefly, as Byrne puts it: \u201cif the way\nthe world seems to him hasn\u2019t changed, then it can\u2019t be\nthat the phenomenal character of his experience has\nchanged\u201d (p. 207), where by \u201cphenomenal character\u201d\nin the context Byrne means sensory qualities. Suppose a subject has\ntwo consecutive experiences that differ in qualitative character. If\nshe is \u201ccompetent\u201d in the sense of having no cognitive\nshortcomings (in particular, her memory is in good working order) and\nis slightly idealized in one or two other ways, she will notice the\nchange in qualitative character. If so, Byrne argues, the way things\nseems to her when she has the second experience must differ from the\nway they seemed to her while she was having the first. For suppose\nthat consecutive experiences are the same in content. Then the world\nseems exactly the same to the subject during both. She \u201chas no\nbasis for\u201d noticing a change in qualitative character either,\nand by the previous premise it follows that there was no change in\nqualitative character (p. 211). The argument generalizes in each of\nseveral natural ways, and Byrne concludes that experiences cannot\ndiffer in qualitative character without differing in representational\ncontent.\n\nIf this sounds too close to being another simple appeal to\ntransparency\u2014and/or to beg the question against mental\npaint\u2014Byrne hastens to add that his argument does not require\ntransparency and is compatible with the existence of mental paint (pp.\n212\u201313). So far as a subject is aware of mental paint, her\nexperience is \u201cpartly reflexive\u201d and represents its own\npaint. Therefore, a difference in paint would be another difference in\nrepresentatum, not a qualitative difference unaccompanied by a content\ndifference.\n\nFrom the orthodox representationalist point of view, that may seem a\ndangerous concession. Byrne does hew to the\nrepresentationalist\u2019s line of supervenience (no qualitative\ndifference without an intentional difference), but if his argument\ndoes not rule out mental paint, an anti-representationalist may\nconstruct inversion cases such as that of Block\u2019s (1990)\n\u201cInverted Earth\u201d (see Section 4.4 below), and argue that\nthe paint is a nonfunctional intrinsic mental feature of the\nexperience given in introspection, which is close enough to a\n\u201cquale\u201d in Block\u2019s special sense, even if the\nfeature does happen to be reflexively represented by the experience\nitself.\n\nAn anti-representationalist might also complain that Byrne has\nequivocated on \u201cseems.\u201d Block (1996) argued that\n\u201clooks\u201d (as in \u201cThat thing looks red to me\u201d)\nis ambiguous, as between an intentional or representational sense and\na separable phenomenal sense, and he believes inversion cases show\nthat the two sorts of looking can come apart. No doubt he would hold\nthe same of \u201cseems.\u201d Whether or not one is persuaded of\nthat claim, Byrne\u2019s argument presupposes that it is false. While\ndoing that does not strictly beg the question, the argument does help\nitself to an assumption that is unlikely to be granted by the\nanti-representationalist.\n3.5 The Argument from Hallucination\n\nPautz (2007, 2010) appeals to hallucinatory experience. Suppose you\nhallucinate (simultaneously) a red ellipse, an orange circle, and a\ngreen square, without ever previously having encountered any of those\ncolors or shapes. That experience directly gives you the capacity to\nform beliefs about the external world, e.g., that there is a red\nellipse, that red is more like orange than like green, and that\nellipses are more like circles than like squares. This\n\u201cgrounding property\u201d of the experience motivates a\n\u201crelational\u201d view of it, according to which having the\nexperience puts the subject in a relation to \u201citems involving\nproperties which, if they are properties of anything at all, are\nproperties of extended objects\u201d (2007, p. 524). Pautz offers two\nfurther arguments for relationality, based respectively on the\n\u201cmatching property\u201d and the \u201ccharacterization\nproperty.\u201d\n\nGiven relationality, representationalism still has three rivals:\nsense-data, Peacocke\u2019s (2008) \u201csensationalist\u201d\ntheory, and Alston\u2019s (1999) \u201ctheory of appearing.\u201d\nBut each of the rivals succumbs to objections; so representationalism\nis true of hallucinatory experience. Now, why not extend\nrepresentationalism to experience across the board? At this point\nthere is just one still unrefuted opponent: the \u201cpositive\u201d\ndisjunctivist who maintains that veridical experience differs\nradically in kind from hallucination. Pautz argues that that view is\nnot worth the complications it enforces.\n\nIt remains to show that an experience\u2019s characteristic\nqualitative properties can be identified with its representational\nproperties. At this point Pautz appeals to the assumption that for any\nqualitative difference between two visual experiences, the difference\nhas a spatial component, either in distinguishing two subregions of\none\u2019s visual field or in attending to one rather than another.\nIn no case, Pautz maintains, is there going to be an experiential\ndifference without a representational difference.\n\nSince Pautz has proceeded by objecting to various competing views, we\nmust hear what their respective proponents will say in rebuttal.\n3.6 Awareness of sensory qualities\n\nThe discussion in this past section and in the next focus on the\nnature of sensory qualities themselves. According to the\nrepresentationalist, the qualities are not mental; the corresponding\nmental property of a sensory state is that of representing\nthe relevant quality. Of course, it is sensory states and experiences\nthemselves that interest philosophers of mind, and some critics of\nrepresentationalism will protest that merely representing a quality\ncannot be all there is to having the qualitative character that needs\nexplaining; we shall return to that complaint in section 4.2\nbelow.\n\nAs yet we have said nothing about what it is to be aware of a\nquality.\n\nIf a sensory quality is an intentional object of a mental state, then\npresumably the state\u2019s owner is aware of the quality in whatever\nway a person is aware of the intentional contents of her/his mental\nstates generally, including those of nonsensory propositional\nattitudes. The general issue is problematic and is much discussed in\nthe \u201cself-knowledge\u201d literature. There are various\noptions: higher-order representation; self-representation; attentional\nmodulation; \u201cacquaintance\u201d of some sort more intimate than\nany of the foregoing; or the automatic replication of a first-order\nstate\u2019s content in any other state directed upon the first. In\nany case, however, the problems of awareness of content are already\nwith us, and do not afflict the representational theory of sensory\nqualities in particular.\n4. Objections to the Representational Theory\n\nThe (strong) representational theory entails the obvious supervenience\nclaim: that there can be no difference in sensory qualities without a\nrepresentational difference. Objections to the theory have most often\ncome in the form of counterexamples to that thesis. But we shall begin\nwith four more general complaints.\n4.1 Objections to the Nonactual\n\nSome philosophers are squeamish about the representationalist\u2019s\ncommitment to nonactual objects in cases of hallucination or\nperceptual illusion. For example, Loar (2003) imagines comparing the\nexperience of seeing a lemon and a subjectively indistinguishable case\nof hallucinating an exactly similar lemon. \u201cA way of putting\nthis is representational: the two experiences present the real lemon\nand a merely intentional object as exactly similar, and that is what\nmakes the experiences indistinguishable\u2026. At the same time, one\nhas a good sense of reality, and so wants to hold that the merely\nintentional lemon is nothing at all, and so not something that can\nresemble something else\u201d (p. 84). A similar sentiment is\nsympathetically attributed to Fred Dretske by Levine (2003, p. 59n).\nThe representational theory is sometimes assimilated to Alexius\nMeinong\u2019s fanciful view that along with the many things that\nactually exist, there are plenty of other things that are like the\nthings that exist except for happening to lack the property of\nexisting. (Thus, Mage exists but does not have wings; Pegasus lacked\nexistence but had wings.)\n\nBut it is important to see that the metaphysics of nonexistence is\neveryone\u2019s problem, not peculiarly that of the\nrepresentationalist (or of one\u2019s current opponent on whatever\nissue in the philosophy of mind). There are things that do not exist,\nsuch as a hallucinated pink rat or a hallucinated lemon. However\ntroublesome it is for fundamental ontology, that fact does not entail\nMeinong\u2019s exegesis of it, or David Lewis\u2019 concretist\ninterpretation, or any other particular metaphysical account of it.\nThe representational theory of sensory qualities is neutral on such\nunderlying issues; it says only that when you hallucinate a lemon, the\nyellowness you experience is that of the lemon. Of course, neither the\nlemon nor its color actually exists, but as before, there are plenty\nof things that do not exist. (And one should question whether, as Loar\nmaintains, nonactual things and people cannot resemble actual\nones.)\n4.2 Unconscious Representation\n\nSturgeon (2000), Kriegel (2002a) and Chalmers (2004) argue that\nrepresentation cannot suffice for a sensory quality (or for there\nbeing something it is like for the subject to do the representing, but\nthat is not our topic for now), because representation can occur\nunconsciously. This appears to refute pure representationalism, since\naccording to that view representation of the relevant sort of property\ndoes necessarily constitute a sensory quality. The point is not highly\nsignificant, since as before, pure representationalism is an\nunoccupied position. The real question is, whether the concern behind\nthis objection carries over to \u201cquasi-\u201d or other strong\nrepresentationalism.\n\nSturgeon does seem to hold the stronger view that not even\nrepresentation of whatever special sort is appealed to by the\nquasi-representationalist can suffice for a sensory quality, because\nany such representation can occur unconsciously. Since the\nquasi-representationalist maintains precisely that a sensory quality\nis simply a representatum of the relevant sort, this would be an\noutright refutation.\n\nThis objection rests on the crucial assumption that sensory qualities\ncan occur only consciously. That assumption shares the usual multiple\nambiguity of \u201cconscious.\u201d The interpretation on which the\nobjection\u2019s premise is most obviously true is that of sense (1)\nor sense (2) above: Representation can occur without its\nsubject\u2019s being aware of it, and/or without the subject\u2019s\nintrospecting it. But if we then understand the tacit assumption in\nthe same way, it would be independently rejected by most\nrepresentationalists, who already hold that a sensory quality can\noccur without being noticed by its host. (Consider the driver driving\n\u201con autopilot\u201d who obviously saw the red light, and saw\nits redness in particular, but who was daydreaming and quite unaware\nof the redness, or even of applying the brake.) If, rather, sense (3)\nis intended, the assumption would be fine, because tautologous (a\nquality cannot occur without a quality occurring); but the\nobjection\u2019s premise would be, in effect, a flat and\nquestion-begging denial of strong representationalism, saying that the\nrelevant representation can occur without a sensory quality\noccurring.\n\nWhat of sense (4)? Here the objection gets a slightly better foothold.\nThe premise is true; representation can occur without there being\nsomething that representing is like for the subject. And there is at\nleast a sense of the phrase \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d in\nwhich the tacit assumption is true also: Recall that some theorists\nhave used that phrase simply to mean a sensory quality (in sense (3));\nso again the assumption would be tautologous. But the present concern\nis for sense (4), and at this point the objection breaks down. For so\nfar as has been shown, a (first-order) quality can occur without there\nbeing anything it is like for the subject to experience that quality\non that occasion; the subject may be entirely unaware of it.\n\nIn virtue of what, then, does an experience contain, or have inhering\nwithin it, a sensory quality? The representationalist\u2019s answer\nis, in virtue of representing that quality in a distinctive way. What\nare distinctive about that mode of representation are (a) the\nfunctional considerations needed to specify the relevant sense\nmodality, and (b) assuming \u201cexperience\u201d implies\nawareness of the sensory quality, whatever is called for by\none\u2019s account of awareness-of.\n4.3 \u201cPhenomenal Intentionality\u201d\n\nTerry Horgan and co-authors, beginning with Horgan (2000) and Horgan\nand Tienson (2002), inaugurated the \u201cPhenomenal Intentionality\nResearch Program.\u201d (The view was anticipated by Siewert (1998),\nand see, e.g., the essays collected in Kriegel (2013), as well as\nMendelovici (2018).) It was inspired in part by an idea of\nLoar\u2019s (1987, 2003), but its approach is different and its\nclaims are much more ambitious. Its proponents defend an internal,\nnarrow type of intentionality that (Horgan and Tienson say) is not\nonly determined by phenomenology but is constituted by it\n(pp. 520, 524); indeed, they contend (p. 529) that their internal\nintentionality is \u201cthe fundamental kind of\nintentionality: the narrow, phenomenal kind that is a prerequisite for\nwide content and wide truth conditions.\u201d And by\n\u201cphenomenal,\u201d they seem to mean \u201cwhat it\u2019s\nlike\u201d properties in the higher-order sense.\n\nThis would imply that \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d properties\nare conceptually or at least metaphysically prior to intentionality.\nPut together with representationalism about sensory qualities, it\nwould follow that \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d properties are\nprior to those, which is quite contrary to the spirit of (though not\nflatly incompatible with) representationalism, and certainly it poses\na general threat of circularity. Moreover, some proponents concede\nthat it is anti-naturalistic and may require a departure from\nmaterialism; but Mendelovici and Bourget (2014) argue that\nnaturalistic considerations actually favor phenomenal\nintentionality.\n\nAn obvious objection is that many perceptual states and other clearly\nintentional occurrent states are not conscious in sense (1) above;\ntheir subjects are entirely unaware of them, and they have no\nphenomenology at all. Kriegel (2011) replies, contending that the\nintentionality of such states is not \u201cintrinsic\u201d but\n\u201cinterpretivist,\u201d merely charitable interpretation\n\u00e0 la Donald Davidson and D.C. Dennett. Mendelovici (2018, Ch.\n8) reviews several further strategies and proposes a combination of\nthose.\n\nA further objection is that since phenomenal intentionality is narrow,\nthe view cannot account for the wide intentionality of everyday mental\nstates. Proponents reply either that wide \u201ccontents\u201d are\nnot really contents (e.g., Horgan and Tienson, Bourget (2010)), or\nthat they are derived in a deflationary way from the narrow phenomenal\ncontents (e.g., Siewert, Kriegel, Farkas (2008)). \n\nThe \u201cphenomenal intentionality\u201d view will have to be\nconsidered on its merits, and after we have seen what account it\naffords of the sensory qualities. (However, it blocks any direct\nargument for representationalism based on transparency. Indeed,\nKriegel (2007, p. 321) appeals to transparency in support of\nphenomenal intentionality.) For further discussion, see the entry on\n phenomenal intentionality.\n4.4 \u201cLaws of appearance\u201d\n\nPautz (2017) points out that there are restrictions on sensory\nappearances that have no parallel for other intentional states such as\nbeliefs. For example, a surface cannot appear both round and square,\nor both pure red and pure yellow at the same place at the same time;\nnor can anything seem round or red but not extended. Pautz contends\nthat such impossibilities are metaphysical in strength. In contrast,\nthere is nothing metaphysically or even nomologically impossible, but\nonly irrational, about contradictory or otherwise anomalous beliefs or\ndesires. How is a representationalist to explain the existence of such\nlaws?\n\nSpeaks (2017) responds by questioning whether the laws are\nmetaphysically necessary. Perhaps they arise simply from how we are\nbuilt. We might have had sense modalities that worked differently, in\nsuch a way as to allow representation of the anomalous states of\naffairs.\n\nFurther, even if the impossibilities are metaphysical, they may arise\nfrom the metaphysics of functional roles of sensory states rather than\nfrom the sense modalities\u2019 representational capacities.\n4.5 Counterexamples\n\nNow we come to the cases in which, allegedly, either two experiences\ndiffer in their sensory qualities without differing in intentional\ncontent or they differ entirely in their intentional content but share\nsensory qualities. Let us start with the degenerate case in which\n(supposedly) there is no intentional content to begin with.\n4.5.1 Nonintentional mental states\n\nIf every sensory quality is a represented property, then phenomenal\ncharacter in sense (3) is exhausted by the intentionality of the\nrelevant experience. Since vision is pretty plainly representational,\nit is no surprise that representationalists have talked mainly about\ncolor qualities. But many other mental states that have phenomenal\ncharacter are not intentional and do not represent anything: bodily\nsensations, and especially moods. Rey (1998): \u201cMany have noted\nthat states like that of elation, depression, anxiety, pleasure,\norgasm seem to be just overall states of oneself, and not\nfeatures of presented objects\u201d (p. 441, italics original). For\nthat matter, it is hardly obvious that every specifically perceptual\nexperience represents\u2014smell, for example, does not clearly do\nso.\n\nThe representationalist has several options here. First, s/he could\nrestrict the thesis to perceptual experiences, or to states that are\nadmitted to be intentional. But that would be ad hoc, and would leave\nthe phenomenal character of the excluded mental states entirely\nunexplained.\n\nSecond, representationalists such as Lycan (1996, 2001) and Tye (1995,\n2003b) have, in some detail, defended Brentano\u2019s thesis that in\nfact every mental state is intentional, including bodily sensations\nand moods. It is easy enough to argue that pains and tickles and even\norgasms have some representational features (see Tye (1995) and Lycan\n(1996)). For example, a pain is felt as being in a certain part of\none\u2019s body, as if that part is disordered in a certain\nway; that is why pains are described as \u201cburning,\u201d\n\u201cstabbing,\u201d \u201cthrobbing\u201d and the like. Though\nit is harder to maintain that a mood has intentional content, it is\nplausible to say that a state of elation, for example, represents\none\u2019s surroundings as being beautiful and exciting, and\nfree-floating anxiety represents that something bad is about to\nhappen. However, this does not answer the previous objection that even\nwhen it is admitted that a pain, a tickle, or a general depression\ndoes represent something, that representational content does not loom\nvery large in the overall phenomenal character of the mental state in\nquestion.\n\nThird, if transparency is rejected, other introspectible features of\nan experience can be allowed to count as part of its phenomenal\ncharacter. Lycan (1998) argues that for some mental states, sensory\nqualities do not exhaust their \u201coverall feel.\u201d Consider\npains. Armstrong (1968) and Pitcher (1970) argued convincingly that\npains are representational and have intentional objects, real or\nunreal as usual, which objects are unsalutary conditions of body\nparts; pain is a kind of proprioception. But those intentional objects\nare not all I can introspect about a pain. I can also introspect its\nawfulness, its urgency. We should distinguish the pain\u2019s sensory\nquality, its specifically sensory core (say, the throbbing character\nof a headache) from the pain\u2019s affective and conative aspect\nthat constitutes its awfulness. Those are not normally felt as\ndistinct, but two different neurological subsystems are responsible\nfor the overall experience, and they can come apart. The quality is\nwhat remains under morphine; what morphine blocks is the affective\naspect\u2014the desire that the pain stop, the distraction, the urge\nto pain-behave. It is then open to the materialist to treat the\naffective components as functional rather than representational, and\nthat is not ad hoc.\n\nFourth, recall the distinction between senses (3) and (4) of the\ntricky term \u201cphenomenal character.\u201d As always, the\nrepresentational theory addresses only sense (3). But sense (4), that\nof \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to entertain a given sensory\nquality, can be generalized: It is not only qualities that have the\nhigher-order what-it\u2019s-like property; arguably propositional\nattitudes and other states that do not involve qualities in sense (3),\nsuch as occurrent thoughts, have it too (Siewert (1998), Pitt (2004)).\nSo the representationalist can accuse the present objection of\nconfusing (4) with (3). It remains to be argued how plausible that\naccusation would be.\n4.5.2 Same intentional contents, different sensory qualities\n\nPeacocke (1983) gave three examples of this kind, Block (1995, 1996) a\nfew others; for discussion of those, see Lycan (1996). Tye (2003a)\nprovides an extensive catalogue of further cases, and rebuts them on\nthe representationalist\u2019s behalf. In each case, the\nrepresentationalist tries to show that there are after all intentional\ndifferences underlying the qualitative differences in question.\n\nTrees. In Peacocke\u2019s leading example, your experience\nrepresents two (actual) trees, at different distances from you but as\nbeing of the same physical height and other dimensions; \u201c[y]et\nthere is also some sense in which the nearest tree occupies more of\nyour visual field than the more distant tree\u201d (p. 12). That\nsense is a qualitative sense, and Peacocke maintains that the\nqualitative difference is unmatched by any representational\ndifference.\n\nTye (1995) and others have rejoined that there are after all\nidentifiable representational differences constituting the qualitative\ndifferences in the trees example. Tye points to the fact that one of\nthe trees subtends a larger visual angle from the subject\u2019s\npoint of view, and he argues that this fact is itself\n(nonconceptually) represented by the visual experience. Lycan contends\nthat perceptual representation is layered, and vision in particular\nrepresents physical objects such as trees by representing\nitems called \u201cshapes,\u201d most of which are nonactual; in the\ntrees case differing shapes are represented. Much more promisingly,\nSchellenberg (2008) appeals to \u201csituation-dependent\u201d\nproperties of external objects, by perceiving which we also perceive\nthe high-level properties of the same objects. Byrne (2001) merely\nobserves that one of the trees is represented as being farther from\nthe subject than the other. Bourget (2015) even less commissively\npoints out that your experience represents fewer small features of the\nfarther tree. For further discussion, see Millar (2010).\n\nPeacocke\u2019s second and third examples concern, respectively,\nbinocular vision and the Necker reversible-cube illusion. On the\nformer, see Tye (1992) and Lycan (1996). The latter has given rise to\na distinctive literature.\n\nAspect-perception and attention. The Necker cube is one of a\ngrowing family of alleged counterexamples involving aspect-perception\nor selective attention. Others include ambiguous pictures such as the\nfamous duck-rabbit; arrays of dots or geometric figures which can be\n\u201cgrouped\u201d by vision in alternate ways; or other displays\nwhich can be attended to in multiple ways. In each case, a single and\nunchanging figure that seems to be univocally represented by vision\nnonetheless gives rise to differing visual experiences.\n\nRepresentationalists of course respond by trying to specify distinct\nproperties as characteristic representata in the differing\nexperiences. For example, a \u201cduck\u201d experience of the\nduck-rabbit will represent the property of being a bill without\nrepresenting that of being an ear; the \u201crabbit\u201d experience\nwill do the opposite. One way of grouping dots will mobilize the\nconcept of a row but not that of a column, etc. Macpherson (2006)\noffers a rich survey of such examples and rebuts representationalist\nreplies both existing and anticipated.\n\nOne of the most interesting recent examples (not discussed by\nMacpherson) is offered by Nickel (2007):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\u00a01\u00a0\n\u00a02\u00a0\n\u00a03\u00a0 \n\n\u00a04\u00a0\n\u00a05\u00a0\n\u00a06\u00a0 \n\n\u00a07\u00a0\n\u00a08\u00a0\n\u00a09\u00a0  \n   \n\n\n\nNickel says we can see an arbitrarily chosen set of constituent\nsquares \u201cas prominent.\u201d For example, in Figure 1 we can\nsee the squares corresponding to 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 as prominent, or\nalternately see 2, 4, 6, and 8 as prominent, without changing where we\nlook and, it seems, while representing just the same figure and its\nelements all the while. In particular, we need not change the focus of\nour vision, but leave it on the center of Figure 1, yet have different\nexperiences.\n\nThe representationalist has several options here. First, focusing on\nNickel\u2019s phrase \u201csee as prominent,\u201d s/he could claim\nthat a distance illusion is created, so that the \u201cfarther\naway\u201d relation is represented; or, noting that the preposition\n\u201cas\u201d seems already to be representational language, s/he\ncould appropriate Nickel\u2019s own term \u201cprominent\u201d as\ndesignating a property and just leave it unexplicated. Second, the\nrepresentationalist could insist that the figure is pictorial, and\nthen invoke some version of figure-ground, or assimilate the case to\nseeing-as of some other sort (assuming s/he had already provided a\nrepresentational account of seeing-as more generally). Third, s/he\nmight reject Nickel\u2019s assumption that the whole figure is\nactually seen at one time, writing off the contrary impression as what\nNo\u00eb (2004) calls \u201cpresence as absence.\u201d And there are\nother possibilities, though each is bound to be contentious.\n\nBlock (2010) offers cases in which shifts of attention seem to change\nsensory qualities (Carrasco (2006)). \u201cThe effect of attention is\nexperienced in terms of appearance of contrast, speed, size, color\nsaturation, etc. Attended things look bigger, faster, more saturated,\nand higher in contrast\u201d (p. 44). Realism about contrast, speed\nand the rest being assumed, it would seem clear that if an attended\nthing looks (e.g.) bigger than its actual size, that is just a false\nor inaccurate representation. But Block takes pains to forestall that\ninference. For further defense of representationalism against\nthese and still more examples of subjective differences in\n\u201cgrouping\u201d and/or \u201cprominence,\u201d see Green\n(2016).\n\n\nBlurry vision. We must revisit that case (which actually was\nintroduced as a problem for representationalism by Boghossian and\nVelleman (1989)), because it requires a wrinkle in the\nrepresentationalist strategy. The normal representationalist move\nwould be to say that the visual experience represents the relevant\npart of the world as being blurry, but here we want to concede that\nthere is a phenomenal difference between seeing an object as being\nblurry and blurrily seeing a nonblurry object. Tye (2003a) points out\nthat that difference can be characterized informationally: In the\nformer case, as when looking at a blurry painting, vision represents\nthe blurred edges as such, and just where they lie. But in the latter,\nvision provides less information, and fails to represent the sharp\nedges. Tye distinguishes similarly between nonveridically seeing a\nsharp object as blurry, which experience incorrectly represents the\nboundaries as fuzzy, and seeing the same object blurrily, which does\nnot represent them, except to place them within broad limits. Allen\n(2013) contends, to the contrary, that a blurry visual experience\nrepresents objects as having multiple boundaries. Bourget (2015)\nargues that, whatever the positive details, a blurry experience\nloses some of the content that would be represented by a\nsharper experience of the exact same scene.\n4.5.3 Inversions\n\nInversion examples in the tradition of Locke\u2019s \u201cinverted\nspectrum\u201d form a special category of alleged counterexamples to\nrepresentationalism. Some fit the foregoing model (same intentional\ncontents, different sensory qualities), some do not. Lockean inversion\nwas that of color qualities with respect to behavioral dispositions,\nwhich is regarded as possible by everyone except behaviorists and\nWittgensteinians. To find an inversion counterexample to the\nrepresentational theory, the objector would have to posit qualities\ninverted with respect to all representational contents, or, in the\ncase of \u201cmixed\u201d or \u201cquasi-\u201d\nrepresentationalism, qualities inverted with respect to all\nrepresentational contents and all the relevant functional\netc. properties. (It is important to see that the latter inversion\nhypothesis is much more ambitious and should be much more\ncontroversial than the original Lockean idea.)\n\nShoemaker (1991) contends that this strong sort of inversion is\npossible, i.e., that sensory qualities could invert with respect to\nrepresentational contents. But his only argument seems to be that such\nan inversion is imaginable, or conceivable in a thin sense. Since the\nrepresentationalist\u2019s claim is precisely that sensory qualities\njust are representational contents of a certain kind, but not that\nthis is analytically or conceptually true, Shoemaker has given her/him\nno reason to think that the inversion is really, metaphysically,\npossible. (Also, it is too easy to think of color looks inverting with\nrespect to mere representation; cf. the opening paragraph of\nSection 2. One has to try to imagine their inverting with respect to\nvisual representation of the appropriate type.) Yet there are\nfurther inversion scenarios, supported by argument, that the\nrepresentationalist must take seriously.\n\nFish-heads. Building on an example of Byrne\u2019s (2001),\nLevine (2003) supposes that there are creatures whose eyes are on\nopposite sides of their heads and whose heads are fixed, so that they\nnever look at an object with both eyes. Now, imagine one such creature\nwhose eyes\u2019 lenses are color-inverted with respect to each\nother. (It is not that one lens has been inverted; the creatures are\nborn thus mismatched.) It seems that identically colored objects\nsimultaneously presented will look, say, green to one eye but red to\nthe other. Yet the same worldly color property (i.e., a reflectance\nproperty of whatever sort) is being represented by each eye. Now,\nevery eye is normal within the population, so neither can easily be\ndescribed as misrepresenting the colors of red objects. Each\neye just sees the colors differently, and so the difference is not\nexhausted by the common representatum.\n\nThe first point to be made on the representationalist\u2019s behalf\nis that, as Levine goes on to admit (p. 71), the eyes seem to be\nrepresenting the world differently; \u201cspace appears differently\nfilled on the two sides of the head.\u201d Also, if the fish-head\nwere able to turn and look at the same object first with one eye and\nthen with the other and back again, the object would successively\nappear to it to be different colors. So we do not here have a\ncase of phenomenal difference without representational difference.\n\nBut there is still a puzzle. If the two eyes are representing\ndifferent properties and neither is misrepresenting, and only the one\nsurface reflectance property is involved, what are the two distinct\nrepresentata? Several options are available. (i) One could try to find\na basis for saying that one of the eyes is (after all)\nmisrepresenting, though it is hard to imagine what basis that might\nbe. (ii) As Levine points out, one could fall in with the view of\nShoemaker (1994) mentioned in Section 2, that the eyes are\nrepresenting distinct dispositions even though the\ndispositions are realized by the same physical properties. (iii) If\nthe eyes are mutually color-inverted, then they differ functionally. A\npsychosemantics such as Dretske\u2019s (1986) that makes essential\nreference to function might therefore distinguish representata here.\n(iv) To the extent that each creature\u2019s two eyes differ\nfunctionally from each other, the creature has two different and\nnonequivalent visual systems. Perhaps, then, we cannot say that either\neye represents its red object as red, or as green; the same\nreflectance property is one color for one of the visual systems and a\ndifferent color for the other, as it might be between two different\nspecies of organism, and we do not know what those colors are. That\nthe realizing reflectance property is the same in each case does not\nestablish sameness of representatum, because that property may be a\ncommon disjunct of each of two distinct disjunctive properties that\nare respectively colors for the two types of visual system.\n\nInverted Earth. Block (1990) appeals to an \u201cInverted\nEarth,\u201d a planet exactly like Earth except that its real\nphysical colors are (somehow) inverted with respect to ours. The\nInverted Earthlings\u2019 speech sounds just like English, but their\nintentional contents in regard to color are inverted relative to ours:\nWhen they say \u201cred,\u201d they mean green (if it is green\nInverted objects that correspond to red Earthly objects under the\ninversion in question), and green things look green to them\neven though they call those things \u201cred.\u201d Now, an\nEarthling victim is chosen by the customary mad scientists, knocked\nout, fitted with color inverting lenses, transported to Inverted\nEarth, and repainted to match that planet\u2019s human skin and hair\ncoloring. Block contends that after some length of time\u2014a few\ndays or a few millennia\u2014the victim\u2019s word meanings and\npropositional-attitude contents and all other intentional contents\nwill shift to match the Inverted Earthlings\u2019 contents, but,\nintuitively, the victim\u2019s color qualities will remain the same.\nThus, sensory qualities are not intentional contents.\n\nA natural representationalist reply is to insist that if the\nintentional contents would change, so too would the qualitative\ncontents. Block\u2019s nearly explicit argument for denying this is\nthat \u201cqualia\u201d (he fails to distinguish sensory qualities,\nsense (3), from their higher-order \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d\nproperties, sense (4)) are narrow, while the intentional contents\nshift under environmental pressure precisely because they are wide. If\nsensory qualities are indeed narrow, and all the intentional contents\nare wide and would shift, then Block\u2019s argument succeeds.\n(Stalnaker (1996) gives a version of Block\u2019s argument that does\nnot depend on the assumption that the qualities are narrow; Lycan\n(1996) rebuts it.)\n\nThree replies are available, then: (i) To insist that the visual\nintentional contents would not shift. Word meanings would shift, but\nit does not follow that visual contents ever would. (ii) To hold that\nalthough all the ordinary intentional contents would shift, there is a\nspecial class of narrow though still representational contents\nunderlying the wide contents; sensory qualities can be identified with\nthe special narrow contents. (iii) To deny that qualitative content is\nnarrow and argue that it is wide, i.e., that two molecularly\nindistinguishable people could indeed experience different qualities.\nThis last is the position that Dretske (1996) has labelled\n\u201cphenomenal externalism,\u201d though (again) in our\nterminology that would have been \u201cqualitative\u201d\nexternalism.\n\nReply (i) has not been much pursued. (ii) has, a bit, by Tye (1994)\nand especially Rey (1998). Rey argues vigorously that\n\u201cqualia\u201d are narrow, and then offers a narrow\nrepresentational theory. (But as previously mentioned, it turns out\nthat Rey\u2019s theory is not a theory of sensory qualities; see\nSection 4.5.) Note that Fregean as opposed to Russellian\nrepresentationalism is well suited to (ii); even if the Russellian\ncontents shift, the Fregean contents need not. Chalmers (2004)\nadvocates such a view. (Papineau (2014) offers a fourth alternative:\nto say that although sensory states do represent worldly properties\nsuch as color and shape, the sensory qualities themselves are simply\nnot representata and do not shift when the environment is inverted;\nrather, they are just narrow properties of subjects. He tries to\nexplain away our feeling that sensory qualities are presented to the\nmind as worldly.)\n\nReply (iii) has been defended by Dretske (1995, 1996), Tye (1995) and\nLycan (1996, 2001). A number of people (even Tye himself (1998)) have\nsince called the original contrary assumption that sensory qualities\nare narrow a \u201cdeep / powerful / compelling\u201d intuition, but\nit proves to be highly disputable. Here are two arguments, though not\nvery strong arguments, for the claim that the qualities are wide.\n\nFirst, if the representational theory is correct, then sensory\nqualities are determined by whatever determines a psychological\nstate\u2019s intentional content; in particular, the color properties\nrepresented are taken to be physical properties instanced in the\nsubject\u2019s environment. What determines a psychological\nstate\u2019s intentional content is given by a\npsychosemantics, in Fodor\u2019s (1987) sense. But every\nknown plausible psychosemantics makes intentional contents wide. Of\ncourse, the representational theory is just what is in question; but\nif one grants that it is independently plausible or at least\ndefensible, the further step to externalism is not a giant step.\n\nSecond, suppose sensory qualities are narrow. Then Block\u2019s\nInverted Earth argument is plausible, and it would show that either\nthe qualities are narrow functional properties or they are properties\nof a very weird kind whose existence is suggested by nothing else we\nknow (see Ch. 6 of Lycan (1996)). But sensory qualities are not\nfunctional properties, at least not narrow ones: recall the Bertie\ndilemma. Also, they are ostensibly monadic properties, while\nfunctional properties are all relational; and see further\nBlock\u2019s anti-functionalist arguments in Block (1978). So, either\nsensory qualities are wide or weirdness is multiplied beyond\nnecessity. Of course, that dichotomy will be resisted by anyone who\noffers a narrow representationalist theory as in (ii) above.\n\nThe Scrambler. Biggs (2009) constructs a complicated example\nin which a human-like species has evolved in such a way that the\nsensory qualities inhering in its members\u2019 perceptual states are\nentirely disconnected both functionally and causal-historically from\ntheir worldly environments. Biggs argues that those states simply lack\nrepresentational content, and he anticipates and rebuts the most\nlikely replies. \n4.6 Arguments against Wide Representationalism\n\nAlthough until the mid-1990s the assumption that sensory qualities are\nnarrow had been tacit and undefended, opponents of wide\nrepresentationalism have since defended the assumption with vigor.\nHere are (only) some of their arguments, with sample replies. (For a\nfuller discussion, see Lycan (2001).)\n\nIntrospection. Block\u2019s Earthling suddenly transported\nto Inverted Earth or some other relevant sort of Twin Earth would\nnotice nothing introspectively, despite a change in representational\ncontent; so the sensory quality must remain unchanged and so is\nnarrow.\n\nReply: The same goes for propositional attitudes, i.e., the\ntransported Earthling would notice nothing introspectively. Yet the\nattitude contents are still wide. Wideness does not entail\nintrospective change under transportation.\n\nNarrow content. In the propositional-attitude literature, the\ncorresponding transportation argument has been taken as the basis of\nan argument for \u201cnarrow content,\u201d viz., for something that\nis intentional content within the meaning of the act but is narrow\nrather than, as usual, wide. The self-knowledge problem\naforementioned, and the problem of \u201cwide causation\u201d (Fodor\n(1987), Kim (1995)), have also been used to motivate narrow content.\nAnd, indeed, any general argument for narrow content will presumably\napply to sensory representation as well as to propositional attitudes.\nIf there is narrow content at all, and sensory content is\nrepresentational, then probably sensory states have narrow content\ntoo. Thus, sensory qualities can and should be taken to be the narrow\ncontents of such states.\n\nReplies: First, this begs the question against the claim that the\nqualities are wide. Even if there are indeed narrow contents impacted\nwithin sensory states, independent argument is needed for the\nidentification of sensory qualities with those contents rather than\nwith wide contents. Second and more strongly, narrow sensory contents\nstill would not correspond to sensory qualities in our sense. So far\nas has been shown, the redness of a patch in my visual field is still\na wide property, even if some other, narrow property underlies it in\nthe same way that (mysterious, ineffable) narrow contents are supposed\nto underlie beliefs and desires.\n\nModelling a shift of qualities. If perceptual contents are\nwide and the environment is subject to change, we should expect a\nshift, even if the perceptual contents would not shift as readily as\nattitude contents would. Perhaps they would eventually shift after\nseveral centuries on Inverted Earth, if a subject could stay alive\nthat long. But how would a distinctive quality even imaginably undergo\nsuch a shift? For example, suppose that a quality is supposed to shift\nfrom blue to yellow. A shift from blue to yellow might reasonably be\nsupposed to be a smooth and gradual shift along the spectrum that\npasses through green. But it is hardly plausible that one would\nexperience such a shift, or a period of unmistakable greenness in\nparticular.\n\nReply: We have no plausible model for a shift of everyday attitude\ncontent either. How would a type of belief state smoothly go from\nbeing about blue to being about yellow? Presumably not by being about\ngreen in between. So our presumed quality shift is no worse off than\nthe attitudinal shift in this regard; if the present argument works\nfor the former case, it also works for the latter, contrary to\nhypothesis.\n\nTo this it may be rejoined that attitude contents are more tractable,\nin that they may yield to some view of aboutness according to which\nreference can divide for a time between contents such as blue\nand yellow. (E.g., Field\u2019s (1973) theory of \u201cpartial\nreference.\u201d) It is harder to imagine \u201cdivided\u201d\nphenomenology.\n\nModes of presentation (Rey (1998); Chalmers (2004) defends a\nsimilar view). There is no such thing as representation without a mode\nof presentation. If a sensory quality is a representatum, then it is\nrepresented under a mode of presentation, and modes of presentation\nmay be narrow even when the representational content itself is wide.\nIndeed, many philosophers of mind take modes of presentation to be\ninternal causal or functional roles played by the representations in\nquestion. Surely they are strong candidates for qualitative content.\nAre they not narrow qualitative features?\n\nReply: Remember, the sensory qualities themselves are properties like\nsubjective greenness and redness, which according to the\nrepresentational theory are representata. The modes or guises\nunder which greenness and redness are represented in vision\nare something else again.\n\nBut it can plausibly be argued that such modes and guises are\nqualitative or phenomenal properties of some sort, perhaps\nhigher-order properties. See the next section.\n\nMemory (Block (1996)). \u201c[Y]ou remember the color of the\nsky on your birthday last year, the year before that, ten years before\nthat, and so on, and your long-term memory gives you good reason to\nthink that the phenomenal character of the experience has not\nchanged\u2026. Of course, memory can go wrong, but why\nshould we suppose that it must go wrong here?\u201d\n(pp. 43\u201344, italics and boldface original). The idea is that\nmemory acts as a check on the sensory qualities, and can be used to\nsupport the claim that the qualities have remained unchanged despite\nthe wholesale shift in representational contents.\n\nReply: Memory contents are wide, and so by Block\u2019s own reasoning\nthey will themselves undergo the representational shift to the\nInverted-Earth complementary color. Thus, your post-shift memories of\ngood old Earth are false. When you say or think to yourself,\n\u201cYes, the sky looks as blue as it did thirty years ago,\u201d\nyou are not expressing the same memory content as you would have when\nyou had just arrived on Inverted Earth. You are now remembering or\nseeming to remember that the sky looked yellow, since for you\n\u201cblue\u201d now means yellow. And that memory is false, since\non the long-ago occasion the sky looked blue to you, not yellow;\nmemory is not after all a reliable check on the sensory qualities.\n(Lycan (1996) takes this line; Tye (1998) expands it in more\ndetail.)\n\nStructural mismatch. Following Hardin (1988) and others,\nPautz (2014, 2019) argues that the structural properties of a sensory\nfield, paradigmatically resemblance relations, match the neural\nsubstrates of the relevant experiences rather than the chemical or\nphysical properties of the representata. For example, the sensory\nquality blue resembles purple more strongly than it resembles green,\nbut the reflectances underlying worldly objects are the other way\naround: the blue reflectance type resembles the green reflectance type\nmore than it does the purple. Even more dramatic mismatches obtain in\nthe case of smell. Therefore, it seems that a sensory quality is a\nnarrow property rather than the wide worldly one predicted by standard\nexternalist psychosemantics.\n\nReply: First, that a sense modality represents two worldly properties\nas being similar to degree n does not entail that they are\nthus similar; there may be illusion regarding resemblance. Second,\nthere will be room for debate regarding exactly what chemical or\nphysical properties do constitute the representata, and regarding what\npsychosemantics connects those properties to the sensory\nexperience.\n\nHardly anyone will accept all of the foregoing replies. But no one\nshould now find it uncontestable either that sensory qualities are\nnarrow or that they are wide. The matter is likely to remain\ncontroversial for some time to come.\n5. What It\u2019s Like\n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Dretske (1995), Tye (1995)) use this\ntroublesome expression simply to mean a sensory quality, and this is\none of the two meanings it has had in recent philosophy of mind. But\nin the fourth paragraph of this entry, the phrase was introduced in\nthe context, \u201c\u2018what it\u2019s like\u2019 for the subject\nto be in a particular mental state, especially what it is like for\nthat subject to experience a particular qualitative property,\u201d\nwhich indicates that there is another sense (4) in which (when the\nmental state does involve a sensory quality) the \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d is something over and above the quality itself.\nIn fact, since this second \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d is\nitself a property of the quality, it cannot very well be identical\nwith the quality. It is the property of what it is like to\nexperience that quality; alternately, the relevant introspectible\nproperty of the experience itself. Let us now just speak of\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d (WIL) properties, meaning just this\nhigher-order phenomenal sort.\n5.1 Higher-order \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like,\u201d Distinct from Sensory Qualities\n\nBlock (1995), like many other writers, fails to distinguish WIL\nproperties from sensory qualities. But Carruthers (2000) elaborates\nnicely on the distinction: A quality in the first-order sense presents\nitself as part of the world, not as part of one\u2019s mind. It is,\ne.g., the apparent color of an apparently physical object (or, if you\nare a Russellian, the color of a sense-datum that you happen to have\nencountered as an object of consciousness). A sensory quality is what\nthe world is or seems like. But what it is like to experience\nthat color is what your first-order perceptual state is like,\nintrinsically mental and experienced as such.\n\nHere are two further reasons for maintaining such a distinct sense of\nthe phrase. First, a sensory quality can be described in one\u2019s\npublic natural language, while what it is like to experience the\nquality seems to be ineffable. Suppose Ludwig asks Bertie, \u201cHow,\nexactly, does the after-image look to you as regards color?\u201d\nBertie replies, \u201cI told you, it looks green.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Ludwig, \u201cbut can you tell me what\nit\u2019s like to experience that \u2018green\u2019 look?\u201d\n\u201cWell, the image looks the same color as that,\u201d says\nBertie, pointing to George Edward\u2019s cloth coat. \u201cNo, I\nmean, can you tell me what it\u2019s like intrinsically, not\ncomparatively?\u201d \u201cUm,\u2026.\u201d \u2014In one way,\nBertie can describe the phenomenal color, paradigmatically as\n\u201cgreen.\u201d But when asked what it is like to experience that\ngreen, he goes mute. So there is a difference between (a) \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d in the bare sense of the quality, the\nphenomenal color that can be described using ordinary color words, and\n(b) \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to experience that phenomenal\ncolor, the WIL property, which cannot easily be described in public\nnatural language at all.\n\nSecond, Armstrong (1968), Nelkin (1989), Rosenthal (1991), and Lycan\n(1996) have argued that sensory qualities can fail to be conscious in\nthe earlier sense of awareness; a quality can occur without its being\neven slightly noticed by its subject. But in such a case, there is a\ngood sense in which it would not be like anything for the subject to\nexperience that quality. (Of course, in the first, Dretske-Tye sense\nthere would be something it was like, since the quality itself is\nthat. But in another sense, if the subject is entirely\nunaware of the quality, it is odd even to speak of the subject as\n\u201cexperiencing\u201d it, much less of there being something it\nis like for the subject to experience it.) So even in the case in\nwhich one is aware of one\u2019s quality, the second type of\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like,\u201d the WIL property, requires\nawareness and so is something distinct from the quality itself.\n5.2 Arguments against Materialism Based on \u201cWhat It\u2019s Like\u201d\n\nIt is the second sense of \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d that\nfigures in anti-materialist arguments from subjects\u2019\n\u201cknowing what it\u2019s like,\u201d primarily Nagel\u2019s\n(1974) \u201cBat\u201d argument and Jackson\u2019s (1982)\n\u201cKnowledge\u201d argument, Chalmers\u2019 (1996, 2003)\nConceivability argument, and Levine\u2019s (1983, 2001) Explanatory\nGap arguments. To begin with the first of those: Jackson\u2019s\ncharacter Mary, a brilliant color scientist trapped in an entirely\nblack-and-white laboratory, nonetheless becomes omniscient as regards\nthe physics and chemistry of color, the neurophysiology of color\nvision, and every other public, objective fact conceivably relevant to\nhuman color experience. Yet when she is finally released from her\ncaptivity and ventures into the outside world, she sees colors for the\nfirst time, and learns something: namely, she learns what it is like\nto see red and the other colors. Thus she seems to have learned a new\nfact, one that by hypothesis is not a public, objective fact. It is an\nintrinsically perspectival fact. This is what threatens materialism,\nsince according to that doctrine, every fact about every human mind is\nultimately a public, objective fact.\n\nUpon her release, Mary has done two things: She has at last hosted a\nred sensory quality, and she has learned what it is like to experience\na red quality. In experiencing it she has experienced a \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d in the first of our two senses. But the fact\nshe has learned has the ineffability characteristic of our second\nsense of \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d; were Mary to try to pass\non her new knowledge of a WIL property to a still color-deprived\ncolleague, she would not be able to express it in English.\n\nWe have already surveyed the representational theory of sensory\nqualities. But there are also representational theories of \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d in the second sense (4). A common reply to the\narguments of Nagel and Jackson (Horgan (1984), Van Gulick (1985),\nChurchland (1985), Tye (1986), Lycan (1987, 1990, 1996, 2003), Loar\n(1990), Rey (1991), Leeds (1993)) is to note that a knowledge\ndifference does not entail a difference in fact known, for one can\nknow a fact under one representation or mode of presentation but fail\nto know one and the same fact under a different mode of presentation.\nSomeone might know that water is splashing but not know that\nH2O molecules are moving, and vice versa; someone might\nknow that person X is underpaid without knowing that she herself is\nunderpaid, even if she herself is in fact person X. Thus, from\nMary\u2019s before-and-after knowledge difference, Jackson is not\nentitled to infer the existence of a new, weird fact, but at most that\nof a new way of representing. Mary has not learned a new fact, but has\nonly acquired a new, introspective or first-person way of representing\none that she already knew in its neurophysiological guise.\n\n(As noted above, the posited introspective modes of presentation for\nsensory qualities in the first-order sense are strong candidates for\nthe title of \u201cqualia\u201d in a distinct, higher-order sense of\nthe term, and they may well be narrow rather than wide. This is what\nRey (1998) seems to be talking about.)\n\nThis attractive response to Nagel and Jackson\u2014call it the\n\u201cperspectivalist\u201d response\u2014requires that the\nfirst-order qualitative state itself be represented (else how could it\nbe newly known under Mary\u2019s new mode of presentation?). And that\nhypothesis in turn encourages a representational theory of\nhigher-order conscious awareness and introspection. However,\nrepresentational theories of awareness face powerful objections, the\nperspectivalist must either buy into such a theory despite its\nliabilities, or find some other way of explicating the idea of an\nintrospective or first-person perspective without appealing to\nhigher-order representation. The latter option does not seem\npromising. And a further question raised by the perspectivalist\nresponse concerns the nature of the alleged first-person\nrepresentation itself.\n\nIt has become popular, especially among materialists, to speak of\n\u201cphenomenal concepts,\u201dand to suppose that Mary has\nacquired one which she can now apply to her first-order qualitative\nstate; it is in that way that she is able to represent the old fact in\na new way. Phenomenal concepts figure also in responses to the\nConceivability and Explanatory Gap arguments.\n\nThe Conceivability argument (Chalmers 1996, 2003) has it that\n\u201czombies\u201d are conceivable\u2014physical duplicates of\nordinary human beings, that share all the human physical and\nfunctional states but lack phenomenal consciousness in sense (4);\nthere is nothing it is like to be a zombie. The argument then moves\nfrom bare conceivability to genuine metaphysical possibility, which\nwould refute materialism. According to the Explanatory Gap argument\n(Levine 1983, 2001), no amount of physical, functional or other\nobjective information could explain why a given sensory state feels to\nits subject in the way it does, and the best explanation of this in\nturn is that the feel is an extra fact that does not supervene on the\nphysical.\n\nLormand (2004) offers a very detailed linguistic analysis of the\nformula \u201cThere is something it is like for [creature] c\nto have [mental state] M,\u201d and on its basis defends the claim\nthat instances of that formula as well as more specific attributions\nof WIL properties can in fact be conceptually deduced at least from\n\u201cnonphenomenal\u201d facts about subjects.\n\nWhat the Knowledge, Conceivability and Explanatory Gap arguments have\nin common is that they move from an alleged epistemic gap to a\nwould-be materialism-refuting metaphysical one. Though some\nmaterialists balk at once and refuse to admit the epistemic gap, more\ngrant the epistemic gap and resist the move to the metaphysical one.\nThe epistemic gap, on this view, is created by the \u201cconceptual\nisolation\u201d of phenomenal concepts from all others, and it is\nconceptual only rather than metaphysical. Stoljar (2005) calls this\nthe \u201cphenomenal concept strategy\u201d. There are a number of\ndistinct positive accounts of phenomenal concepts and how they work;\nsuch concepts are: \u201crecognitional\u201d (Loar (1990),\nCarruthers (2000), Tye (2003c)); proprietary lexemes of an internal\nmonitoring system (Lycan (1996)); indexical (Perry (2001), O\u2019Dea\n(2002), Schellenberg (2013)); demonstrative (Levin (2007), Stalnaker\n(2008), Schroer (2010)); \u201cquotational\u201d or\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d (Papineau (2002), Balog (2012));\n\u201cunimodal\u201d (Dove and Elpidorou (2016)). Some of those\naccounts are minimal, aspiring only to block the key inferences in the\nanti-materialist arguments aforementioned. Others, particularly the\nconstitutive account, are more detailed and offer to explain more\nspecific features of WIL properties. For example, Papineau points out\nthat the constitutive account explains the odd persistent\nattractiveness of some of the obviously fallacious antimaterialist\narguments. He and Balog each argue that the account, according to\nwhich a phenomenal concept token is at least partly constituted by the\nvery mental state-token that is its referent, explains the special\ndirectness of the reference: no feature of the state is appealed to\n(and a fortiori no neural, functional, causal etc. feature);\nBalog adds that since the referent is literally contained and present\nin the concept token, \u201cthere will always be something it is\nlike\u201d to do the tokening (p. 7).\n\nThe phenomenal concept strategy is criticized by Raffman (1995),\nStoljar (2005), Prinz (2007), Chalmers (2007), Ball (2009), Tye\n(2009), Demircioglu (2013), and Shea (2014). For further works and\nreferences see Alter and Walter (2007), Sundstr\u00f6m (2011) and\nElpidorou (2015). Chalmers offers a \u201cMaster Argument\u201d\nmeant to refute any version of the strategy: it is a dilemma based on\nwhether it is conceivable that the complete fundamental physical truth\nholds yet we possess no phenomenal concepts (having whichever\nfeatures). The argument is criticized by Papineau (2007), Carruthers\nand Veillet (2007), and Balog (2012).\n5.3 \u201cIllusionism\u201d\n\nIt is possible simply to deny the existence of WIL properties, as do\nDennett (1991) and Dretske (1995); see also Humphrey (1992, 2011),\nHall (2007), Pereboom (2011) and Tartaglia (2013). To do that is of\ncourse not to defend a representational theory or any other theory of\nthem. But it would be good to explain away the majority belief in such\nproperties, and some theorists do that in representational terms,\narguing that other, real properties are misrepresented in\nintrospection as WIL properties; Frankish (2016) calls this strategy\n\u201cillusionism.\u201d An obvious instance of such a\nmisrepresentation would be to mistake a sensory quality for a WIL\nproperty; since the conflation of the two is already rife even among\nsophisticated philosophers, WIL deniers may suggest that what was\nintrospected was only a sensory quality. (That is one way of\nunderstanding Dretske\u2019s position, bar his resistance to the very\nnotion of introspection as in Dretske (2003).) And as before, the\nphrase \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d has nontendentiously been\nused as referring to a sensory quality rather than to a property of a\nwhole experience. Several authors point out that to reject WIL\nproperties is not to grant Chalmers\u2019 (1996) claim that for a\nzombie lacking WIL properties, \u201call is dark inside\u201d (pp.\n95\u20136).\n\nRey (1992) suggests that introspection mistakes the lack of detail it\ndelivers for the accurate representation of a simple ineffable\nproperty. Alternately or in addition (1995), having detected stable\nand identifiable complexes of involuntary responses to states of\nourselves and to living creatures who look and behave like us, for\nexample the commonsense causal, representational, conative and\naffective syndrome we lump together using the word \u2018pain\u2019,\nwe project a simple quality onto the others and into ourselves. Rey\nand Pereboom each compare the projection of WIL properties into the\nmind by introspection to vision\u2019s projection of simple\nhomogeneous color properties onto environmental objects.\n\nIllusionism is criticized by Strawson (2006), Prinz (2016), Balog\n(2016), Nida-R\u00fcmelin (2016), Schwitzgebel (2016), and Chalmers\n(2018). Though highly sympathetic to illusionism, Kammerer (2018)\nargues that no previously existing account can explain the strength of\nthe illusion. For general discussion, see the essays collected in\nFrankish (2017), and for further defense, see Shabasson (2022).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allen, K., 2013. \u2018Blur\u2019, <em>Philosophical\nStudies</em>, 162: 257\u201373.", "Alston, W., 1999. \u2018Back to the Theory of Appearing\u2019,\nin J.
