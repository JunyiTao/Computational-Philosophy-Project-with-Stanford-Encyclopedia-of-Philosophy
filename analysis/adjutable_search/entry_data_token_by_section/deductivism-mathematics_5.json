    "main_text": "Historical Accounts || Pasch\n3.3 Pasch\n\nThis brings us to Moritz Pasch himself, another contemporary of\nRussell and Hilbert\u2019s who defended a flavour of deductivism.\nPasch is best known for his axiomatisation of geometry in his 1882\nVorlesungen \u00fcber neuere Geometrie. A key passage found\nin the 1882 first edition and, with minimal changes, also in the 1926\nsecond edition, reads as follows:\n\n\nIndeed, if geometry is to be truly deductive [deduktiv],\ndeduction [Deduktion] must be independent everywhere from the\nmeaning of the geometric terms, just as it must be independent of\ndiagrams; only the relations between the geometric terms specified in\nthe utilised theorems and definitions may be considered. During\nthe deduction [Deduktion] it is permitted and useful, but in\nno way necessary, to think of the meanings of the geometric\nterms; in fact, if it is necessary to do so, this makes plain the\ngaps in the deduction, and under certain circumstances even\nthe inadequacy of the theorems invoked in the proof (1882/1926, our\ntranslation and\n emphasis).[8]\n\n\nThis passage does two things: it maintains that the meaning of\ngeometrical terms has no role to play in geometry at its most\nrigorous; and it emphasises proof. So it can be seen as advocating\ndeductivism or, possibly, formalism. \u201cFormalism\u201d here\nmeans what is sometimes called \u201cgame formalism\u201d, i.e., the\nthesis that mathematics is a mere play with symbols according to\ndefined rules. However, other passages in Pasch\u2019s corpus favour\na deductivist interpretation:\n\n\nMathematics is a system with two parts that must be clearly\ndistinguished. The first, the properly mathematical part, is\ndevoted entirely to deduction. The second makes deduction\npossible by introducing and elucidating a series of insights\nthat are to serve as material for deduction, preparing new material\nwhenever the deductive part requires it. This second part, dwarfed by\nthe properly mathematical one, can be called the pre-mathematical\npart, while I might refer to the other as the rigid part,\nsince it forms a structure characterized by the absolute rigor of\nits inference rules. Though it is tempting to ignore how rigorous\nthese rules are, that does not make them any less rigorous. The\nrigid part is, as I said, mathematics proper. It proceeds by\nmathematical proof and mathematical definition. (Pasch 1918\n[2010: 51], our emphasis)\n\n\nPasch thus distinguished between mathematics and what we may call\n\u201cpre-mathematics\u201d. Mathematics is entirely deductive,\nwhereas pre-mathematics serves to motivate the \u201cmaterial for\ndeduction\u201d. Mathematics \u201cdwarfs\u201d pre-mathematics and\nis characterised by \u201cabsolute rigor of its inference\nrules\u201d, which is why Pasch calls it \u201crigid\u201d\n(starr). In light of the above passages, and others, Pasch\nmay reasonably be classified as a deductivist.\n\nPasch takes a notably different view from Hilbert as to what, among\nall the possible sets of axioms a deductivist could adopt,\ncharacterises a \u201cgood\u201d set of axioms. Hilbert\u2019s\nresponse to this question foreshadows his future formalism. In\n\u201cAbout the Concept of Number\u201d, he maintains that, once the\nset of axioms has been proven to be consistent, any further doubt\nabout the existence of the concept number \u201closes all\njustification\u201d (Hilbert 1900a: 184). Classically, consistency is\na necessary condition for a good axiom set, so all forms of\nclassical-logic-based deductivism will adopt it. But whether or not\nconsistency is also sufficient is a matter over which various\ndeductivisms may differ. From a modern perspective, we can think about\nthe sufficiency claim as follows: absent a completeness proof, the\nconsistency of a set of axioms does not in general entail that they\nhave a model. To spell out the familiar argument, let PA2 be the set\nof second-order Peano Axioms, and Con(PA2) a consistency statement for\nPA2. Then \\(\\textrm{PA2} \\cup \\{\\neg \\textrm{Con}(\\textrm{PA2})\\}\\) is\nconsistent provided PA2 is, since \\(\\textrm{PA2} \\not\\vdash\n\\textrm{Con}(\\textrm{PA2})\\) by G\u00f6del\u2019s second\nincompleteness theorem. However, \\(\\textrm{PA2} \\cup\n\\{\\neg\\textrm{Con}(\\textrm{PA}2)\\}\\) lacks a model, and so, under a\ntraditional language-world picture, the language of the axiom system\ndoes not pick out anything in the world. But for a deductivist who\nasserts that only consistency matters, the alleged absence of\nsuccessful reference is of no significance.\n\nWhat distinguishes Pasch\u2019s deductivism from Hilbert\u2019s is\nthat Pasch simultaneously maintained an empiricism about the axioms\n(Schlimm 2010: 95\u201396). He held that the axioms are to have\nindependent empirical grounding (\u201cthe pre-mathematical\npart\u201d above). For example, Pasch grants the possibility of other\nconsistent axiom sets for geometry, but maintains that without\nempirical grounding such a system constitutes merely\n\u201chypothetical geometry\u201d (1917 [2010: 46]). In particular,\nPasch maintains, the hypothetical sentences derived in such a geometry\nmay lack applicability (1917 [2010: 46]; Schlimm 2010: 101).\n",
