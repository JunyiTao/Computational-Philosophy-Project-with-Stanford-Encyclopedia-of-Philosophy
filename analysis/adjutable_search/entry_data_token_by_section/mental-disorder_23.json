The new brain sciences will magnify this\ndisempowerment, it is argued, with the agency and authority previously\nattributed to persons replaced by a bio-scientific \u201cmanagement\nof the mind\u201d (Phillips 2009, 2013; Rose and Abi-Rached 2013). A\nmore recent descendant of mid-twentieth century writing is the\ncollection of concerns known as critical psychiatry: critiques of the\ninfluence of the pharmacological industry (Phillips 1996, 2013;\nMoncrieff 2008; Whitaker & Cosgrove 2015; Karp 2017); a discourse\naround mental disorder that, influenced by hermeneutics, aims to be\nmore sensitive to the meaning of symptoms (Bracken & Thomas 2010);\nand the promotion of a more equal and collaborative relationship\nbetween carers and those they treat (Double 2006; Cohen & Timimi\n2008).\n\nAssociated with these ideas is growing recognition of the unique\nexpertise of \u201cservice users\u201d or \u201csurvivors\u201d\nfor understanding mental disorder, and the importance of its inclusion\nfor research (Faulkner & Leyzell 2000; Gergel 2012; Cooper 2017;\nBueter 2018). These innovations have been analyzed appealing to\ncritical theory, narrative research methods, the impediments to\nrepresentational authority, and the co-production of knowledge\n(Voronka 2016; Russo & Sweeney 2016).\n",
