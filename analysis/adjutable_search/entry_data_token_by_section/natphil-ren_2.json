The close\nrelationship between natural philosophy and medicine had already been\nstressed by Aristotle himself at the beginning of On Sense and\nSensible (436a19\u2013436b2). Medicine often competed with\nnatural philosophy within the universities: philosophy was a\ncurricular requirement for those who wanted to study medicine in the\nItalian universities and many of the greatest Renaissance natural\nphilosophers were also physicians (e.g., Alessandro Achillini\n(1463\u20131512) and Simone Porzio (1496\u20131554); there were also\nprofessional physicians who wrote on natural philosophy, such as\nBalthassar Pisanellus (fl. 1559) and Daniel Furlanus (d. 1600)).\nUbi desinit philosophus (or physicus), incipit\nmedicus (\u201cwhere the philosopher ends, the physician\nbegins\u201d): so went a proverb which implied an ambiguous boundary\nbetween the two disciplines: on the one hand, it reflected the need to\nmove beyond the theory represented by philosophy and into the actual\npractice of medicine; on the other, it affirmed the idea that natural\nphilosophy was necessary in order to prepare for medical studies. From\nthis perspective, natural philosophy represented either a mere\npreparatory stage on the way to the more perfect and concrete\nknowledge of medicine, or, alternatively, medicine was subordinate to\nnatural philosophy (others, like the philosopher Jacopo Zabarella\n(1533\u20131589), preferred to distinguish natural philosophy from\nmedicine because these two disciplines did not share subject and\nmethod).\n\nThe Renaissance debate over the superiority of Aristotle or Galen was\npart of this rivalry: Aristotle was regarded by physicians as an\nimportant authority because of his philosophical system, but Galen had\noffered in his works more precise observations of the human body.\nNonetheless, since many points of their disagreement (e.g., the\nlocalization of the brain functions) were merely founded on\nspeculation, some doctors preferred to demonstrate the harmony between\nAristotle and Galen in order to overcome this impasse.\n\nAnother discipline often compared to natural philosophy was astrology.\nThe Jesuit Benito Pereira (1536\u20131610) stated that natural\nphilosophy is different from astrology because, among other reasons,\nthe former studies things a priori, the latter a\nposteriori. Pereira also claimed that natural philosophy was not\ncapable of delineating its own sphere of inquiry, something which was\npossible for other disciplines such as logic and metaphysics.\n\nUniversity courses on the Physics traditionally began with a\nlecture on ethical themes. This arrangement was inspired by\nAverroes\u2019 proem to the text, which argued for the moral\nperfection of the speculative man. The connection between ethics and\nnatural philosophy also appeared in discussions of subjects like the\nimmortality of the soul or the human will, and consequently ethical\ndiscussions could occupy large sections both in reportationes\nof lessons and commentaries.\n",
