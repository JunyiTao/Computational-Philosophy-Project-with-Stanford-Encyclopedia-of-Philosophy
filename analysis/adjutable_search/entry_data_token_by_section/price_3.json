By\n\u201cempiricism\u201d, he seems to mean two things:\n\nFirst, if we understand a notion (or concept) then we should be able\nto recognise when it applies should the right experiences present\nthemselves. Price (1953a: especially 78, 117, 136, 231, 260, 270,\n355\u2013358) extensively defends his view that understanding,\nconcepts, and ideas themselves are recognitional capacities of\n\u201cconscious creature[s], human or animal\u201d (1959c: 483; for\ndiscussion: Burgener 1957: 157; Warnock [1995: 756] emphasises its\ncentrality for Price). Price links this to the much-discussed slogan,\nwhich he accepts, that to understand a claim is to know what would be\nthe case if it is true (1953a: 208\u2013209; 1938: 442). A key\ncontribution of his is that he thinks that this kind of knowledge\nincorporates a recognitional capacity. \n\nBut second, the test for a theory or conviction lies ultimately in how\nit engages with experience. Regarding religious belief, he recommends\nthat you should try it out and see how the experience of doing so\nstrikes you (1964c: 25\u201325; 1969: 455\u2013488; see\n \u00a76.8).\n He sums up the empiricist programme which he endorses thus: \n\n\nto show that all ideas are ultimately cashable by impressions, that is\nby data which we are acquainted with in sense or introspection, or in\nany other sort of acquaintance there may be [such as, controversially,\n\u201cmystical experience\u201d]. (1940b: 11\u201312) \n\n\nHe also writes: \n\n\nAn empiricist is a man who says \u201cit all comes down to\nostensive definition in the end.\u201d (1959c: 483)\n\n\nAlso, Hume and Locke are his two main philosophical heroes; see Kneale\n1996: xix. In 1959 (1959c: 481), Price writes \u201cI am really just\nan old-fashioned British empiricist\u201d (agreeing with Burgener\n1957), and \u201c[Thinking and Experience, 1953a] protests\nagainst the transformation of the empiricist epistemology into a\nlinguistic epistemology\u201d.\n",
