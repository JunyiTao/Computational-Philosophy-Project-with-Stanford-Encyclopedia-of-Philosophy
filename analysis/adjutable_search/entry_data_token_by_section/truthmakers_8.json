    "main_text": "Which range of truths are eligible to be made true (if any are)? || Optimalism\n2.2 Optimalism\n\nOne way to respond to these difficulties is to abandon maximalism in\nfavour of optimalism, to deny that universal and negative statements\nneed truth-makers. But Merricks argues the optimalist \u201cway\nout\u201d is blocked. Negative truths need truth-makers if any truths\ndo, but they can\u2019t have them. So we must give up thinking that\ntruths need truth-makers in the first place (2007: 39\u201367).\n\nHere\u2019s why Merricks thinks so. In order to avoid the\nover-generation of truth-makers for necessary truths (etc.)\nMerricks imposes a relevance constraint: \u201ca truth-maker must be\nthat which its truth is about\u201d (2007: 28). But can this\nconstraint be satisfied in the case of negative existentials, such as\nthe statement there are no hobbits? This statement isn\u2019t about\nhobbits, because there aren\u2019t any, and other apparent\ncandidates, such as the universe\u2019s exhibiting the global\nproperty of being such that there are no hobbits in it,\nappear hoaxed up and artificial (2007: 43\u201355). Even if one\nfollows Merricks this far, one may still think that negative\nexistentials are the principled exception that proves the rule that a\ntruth-maker for a positive truth must be what its truth is about. But,\nso far as Merricks is concerned, this is throwing the baby out with\nthe bathwater: \n\n\nI deny that if we set aside the intuition that \u201ca truth, any\ntruth\u201d depends on being we are left with the equally compelling\nintuition that all truths except negative existentials depend\non being. (2007: 41) \n\n\nHe also suggests that this position is theoretically disingenuous\nbecause no one would consider retreating to it from full-blown\nmaximalism unless he or she had already been \u201cspooked\u201d by\nhis or her failure to find truth-makers for negative truths; or if\nthey held onto the view that truth is correspondence (Merricks 2007:\n40\u20131; Dodd 2007: 394; Cameron 2008a: 411). Merricks surmises\nthat if we have any reason to commit to truth-makers, we have only\nreason to commit outright to a truth-maker for every truth\n(maximalism). But since maximalism cannot be sustained because of the\nlack of things for negative existentials to be about, Merricks\nrecommends the rejection of truth-makers altogether.\n\nBut optimalists aren\u2019t just \u201cspooked\u201d or\n\u201ctimid\u201d maximalists. They stand on their two feet with a\nprincipled position of their own that need neither be based upon\n\u201cgerrymandered intuition\u201d nor adopted as a consequence of\na forced retreat from maximalism. If maximalism is intellectual heir\nto Russell\u2019s logical atomism, then optimalism (at least in the\nform under consideration) is heir to Wittgenstein\u2019s version of\nthe doctrine according to which it is only atomic propositions that\nrepresent the existence of states of affairs. The optimalists\u2019\nidea is that once truth-makers have been supplied for the atomic\ntruths there is simply no need to posit further truth-makers\nfor the molecular ones. All we need to recognise is that an atomic\nstatement P is true whenever a truth-maker for P\nexists, that P is false if and only if no truth-maker for\nP exists. Once the existence and non-existence of the\ntruth-makers has settled the truth-values of all the atomic\nstatements, the logical operations described by the truth-tables then\nsettle the truth and falsity of all the molecular statements (another\nstory must be told about what the truth-makers are for the\nnon-extensional constructions\u2014another elephant in the room). In\nparticular, the truth-table for negation\u2014that tells us what\n\u201c~\u201d means\u2014assures us that if P is false\nthen ~P is true. So all it takes to make ~P true is\nthat no truth-maker for P exists. Thus Mulligan, Simons, and\nSmith: \n\n\nit seems more adequate to regard sentences of the given kind as true\nnot in virtue of any truth-maker of their own, but simply in virtue of\nthe fact that the corresponding positive sentences have no\ntruth-maker. (1984: 315; see also Mellor 2003: 213\u20134, 2009;\nSimons 2000:7\u20138, 2005: 255\u20136)\n\n\nSimons offers the illuminating reflection: \n\n\nThis is the truth-maker end of Wittgenstein\u2019s insight that\npropositions are bi-polar: if a proposition has one truth-value,\nhowever it gets it, its contradictory opposite has the opposite\ntruth-value without further ado; \n\n\nSimons dubs the truth functional mechanism whereby the negation of an\natomic statement gets the value true, \u201ctruth by default\u201d\n(2008: 14).\n\nOptimalists also think that general truths are true by default so\nthere is no need for bespoke truth-makers for them (like totality\nfacts). Universal quantifications \u2200xFx are logically\nequivalent to negative statements of the form\n\u223c\u2203x\u223cFx. Since the latter are negative,\nthey\u2019re true, if they are, only by default. Then because the\nformer statements are logically equivalent to them, the optimalists\nsurmise that universal quantifications are true by default too (Mellor\n2003: 214; Simons 2008: 14\u20135).\n\nFurther challenges for the optimalist or non-maximalist are discussed\nin Jago 2012, Simpson 2014, Jago 2018 (81\u2013102). \n",
