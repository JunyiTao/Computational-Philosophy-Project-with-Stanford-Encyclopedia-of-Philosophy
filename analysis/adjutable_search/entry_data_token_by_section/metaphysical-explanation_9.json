    "main_text": "Models of metaphysical explanation || The pragmatics of metaphysical explanation\n6.4 The pragmatics of metaphysical explanation\n\nPragmatic accounts of metaphysical explanation hold that whether\nsomething counts as an explanation or not is context-dependent. This\ngoes deeper than thinking that explanatory information is\ncontext-dependent; that there are pragmatic constraints on how much,\nhow little, or what kind of explanatory information to request or give\nin a particular conversation is fairly widely accepted. It also goes\ndeeper than noting that which relation the term \u201cexplains\u201d\npicks out differs from context of utterance to context of utterance\n(since, perhaps, one takes the term \u201cunderstands\u201d to be\ncontext-sensitive in this way, and one takes the conferral of\nunderstanding to be necessary to explanation). The thesis is rather\nthe far more controversial one that metaphysical explanation is\nitself a context-sensitive phenomenon in the sense that the\nfactors relevant to evaluating the truth of a statement of\nmetaphysical explanation, once the context of utterance has settled\nthat statement's truth-conditions, involve facts about actual or\npossible (types of) explanation givers or receivers, such as facts\nabout their interests, conceptual proficiencies, background knowledge,\nand the like.\n\nIn the literature on causal explanation, the most famous proponent of\npragmatic explanation is van Fraassen (1980) who argues that\nexplanations are answers to why-questions. A fairly straightforward\nanalogue for metaphysical explanation would be to hold that\nmetaphysical explanations are answers to what-makes-it-the-case-that\nquestions. There are then various different ways in which aspects of\ncontext become salient. First, the context might focus the question.\nWhen we ask \u201cWhat makes it the case that the ball is\nred?\u201d, we will expect different answers depending on the\ncontrast class we had in mind (e.g., red rather than some other color,\nor red rather than merely appearing to be red). Second, the context\nalso determines the kinds of answers that are acceptable, which might\ndiffer based on (for example) the background knowledge of the\nexplanation-seeker and explanation-receiver. An artist will typically\nhave a far more finely-grained conception of what particular shade\nmakes a certain Rothko painting red than your average schoolchild\nwould, and so a particular answer might count as explanatory for the\nartist but not for a child (who may not even possess the relevant\ncolor concept).\n\nThere has, as of yet, been comparatively little discussion of\npragmatic accounts of metaphysical explanation in the literature. One\nexception is Thompson (2019), who develops an account along the lines\ndescribed above, where metaphysical explanations are pairs of\ncontext-sensitive questions and answers. Because the role of context\nis ineliminable, there is no sense to be made of a notion of\nmetaphysical explanation free from pragmatic constraints. However,\nThompson accounts for the correctness of particular explanations (in\npart) by appeal to worldly dependence relations, and so that\nmetaphysical explanation is pragmatic does not imply that it is wholly\nunconstrained by worldly dependence. A different kind of pragmatic\ntheory of metaphysical explanation is defended by Miller and Norton\n(2017). Their \u201cpsychologistic\u201d account of metaphysical\nexplanation locates the truth conditions for metaphysically\nexplanatory claims in the psychological states of the agents\nevaluating the relevant \u201cbecause\u201d claims, alongside\nworldly necessitation relations. The relevant psychological states are\ndispositions towards particular beliefs, which are expected to vary\nbetween individuals. Claims about what metaphysically explains what\nare thus only true relative to a specific (type of) context within\nwhich the claim's truth is being assessed.\n",
