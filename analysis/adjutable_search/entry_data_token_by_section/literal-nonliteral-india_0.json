Conceptions of language in Indian philosophy\nBefore delving into the various disputes in Indian philosophy over what is commonly termed \u201cliteral meaning,\u201d let us first identify the cluster of concepts and corresponding terms Indian philosophers use in their analysis of meaning. The Sanskrit term for \u201cmeaning,\u201d artha, has a semantic range that includes also \u201cobject,\u201d \u201cwealth,\u201d and \u201cgoal.\u201d It can be used both for external referents of words as well as meanings \u201cin the head,\u201d although the term for occurrent mental states is frequently j\u00f1\u0101na, usually translated as \u201ccognition\u201d or \u201cawareness.\u201d Both words and sentences are said to have meanings, although in what manner they have them, and how word- and sentence-meanings interrelate are subjects of debate.\n",
