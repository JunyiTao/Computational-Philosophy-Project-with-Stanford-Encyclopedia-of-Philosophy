One argument infers it from the motivational\negoist claim that each of us is always motivated to maximize what we\ntake to be our own good, plus the claim that we each accept that our\ngood is our maximal or sufficient balance of pleasure over displeasure.\nBut motivational egoism is at best controversial (see entry on\n egoism).\n Also controversial is the psychological\nthesis that each of us accepts hedonism about our own good. For one\nthing, it ungenerously implies that those who think they reject\nhedonism about their own good do not even know their own minds on this\nmatter.\n\n\nAnother argument for motivational hedonism is this: sometimes we are\nmotivated by pleasure, every case can be accounted for in this\nway, the more unified the account the better, and hedonism is the most\nunified account. But at most, this argument shows only that in the\nunification respect hedonism is the best account of our motivation.\nEven if that is so, unification is not the only feature that it is\ndesirable for theories of motivation to have, and the argument is\nsilent on how motivational hedonism scores on any other desirable\nfeature. The argument consequently fails to establish the overall\nplausibility of motivational hedonism, let alone the thesis that it is\nthe most plausible theory of motivation. In addition, parallel\narguments arguably \u2018show\u2019 that we are sometimes motivated\nto improve ourselves, to survive, to attend to our near-and-dear, to\nlive with integrity, and so forth; that every case can be narrated in\nsuch terms; and thus that all these rival views are just as unified as\nis motivational hedonism.\n\n\nA third argument for motivational hedonism claims that it is a truth\nof everyday meaning that the words \u2018is motivated\u2019 just mean\nsome such thing as \u2018aims for the greatest balance of pleasure\nover pain\u2019. The core trouble here is that motivational hedonism\nis not a truth of everyday meaning. Even if it were such a truth, the\nmain issue of substance would remain. Rivals would simply re-state the\nongoing central issue using neighbouring concepts; for example:\n\u2018however it might be with the narrower concept\n\u201cmotive\u201d, the claim that we are always moved by\npleasure is false\u2019. Nor would it help motivational hedonists to\nmake a Humpty Dumpty move here (see Carroll: ch. 6): \u2018when\nI use the words \u201cis motivated\u201d, said Humpty\nDumpty, they mean just what I choose them to mean, namely\n\u201cis aimed at pleasure\u201d\u2019. Such stipulation does not\nidentify any good reason for anyone to join Humpty Dumpty in his\neccentric word usage.\n\n\nEven if all of the above arguments for motivational hedonism fail,\nother arguments for it could be made. Even if every argument for\nmotivational hedonism fails, failure of a positive is not success of a\nnegative. What then of the arguments against this relatively modest\nform of psychological hedonism?\n",
