    "main_text": "Risk Aversion || Proposals\n5.2 Proposals\n\nThere have been a number of descriptive attempts to explain global\nsensitivity, by those who are either uninterested in normative\nquestions or assume that EU is the correct normative theory. The most\nwell-known of these are prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky 1979;\nTversky & Kahneman 1992) and generalized utility theory (Machina\n1982, 1983, 1987); others are mentioned in the discussion below. See\nStarmer (2000) for an overview.\n\nSome normative proposals seek to accommodate global sensitivity\nwithin expected utility theory, by making the inputs of the\nutility function more fine-grained. Proponents of this\n\u201crefinement strategy\u201d hold that decision-makers prefer\n\\(L_4\\) to \\(L_3\\) because the $0 outcome in \\(L_3\\) would induce\nregret that one forewent a sure $1M (alternatively, because \\(L_4\\)\nincludes psychological certainty) and therefore that the\nconsequence-descriptions should include these facts. Thus, the correct\ndescription of \\(L_3\\) is: \n\n\\[L_3 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 0.89; \\$5,000,000, 0.1; \\$0 \\textit{ and regret, } 0.01\\}\\]\n\n\nOnce these gambles are correctly described, there is no direct\nconflict with EU maximization (Raiffa 1986, Weirich 1986, Schick 1991,\nBroome 1991, Berm\u00fadez 2009, Pettigrew 2015, Buchak 2015). The\nproblem of when two outcomes that appear the same should be\ndistinguished is taken up by Broome (1991), Pettit (1991), and Dreier\n(1996).\n\nThe thought that the value of a consequence depends on what might have\nbeen is systematized by Bradley and Stef\u00e1nsson (2017). Their\nproposal uses a version of expected utility theory developed by\nJeffrey (1965) and axiomatized by Bolker (1966). Jeffrey replaces the\nutility function by a more general \u201cdesirability\u201d function\nDes, which applies not just to consequences but also to prospects;\nindeed, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between \u201cultimate\u201d\nconsequences and prospects, since its inputs are propositions. Bradley\nand Stef\u00e1nsson propose to widen the domain of Des to include\ncounterfactual propositions, thus allowing that preferences for\npropositions can depend on counterfacts. For example, a decision-maker\ncan prefer \u201cI choose the risky options and get nothing, and I\nwouldn\u201dt have been guaranteed anything if I had chosen\ndifferently\u2019 to \u201cI choose the risky option and get\nnothing, and I would have been guaranteed something if I had chosen\ndifferently\u201d, which will rationalize the Allais preferences.\n(Incidentally, their proposal can also rationalize preferences that\nseemingly violate EU because of fairness considerations, as in an\nexample from Diamond (1967).)\n\nIn a different series of articles (Stef\u00e1nsson & Bradley\n2015, 2019), these authors again employ Jeffrey\u2019s framework, but\nthis time widen the domain of Des to include chance\npropositions (in addition to factual prospects), propositions\nlike \u201cthe chance that I get $100 is 0.5\u201d. They hold that a\nrational decision-maker can have a preference between various chances\nof \\(X,\\) even on the supposition that \\(X\\) obtains (she need not\nobey \u201cChance Neutrality\u201d). They capture the idea of\ndisliking risk as such by holding that even though a rational agent\nmust maximize expected desirability, she need not have a \\(\\Des\\)\nfunction of \\(X\\) that is expectational with respect to the Des\nfunction of chance propositions about \\(X\\) (she need not obey\n\u201cLinearity\u201d). For example, \\(\\Des(\\text{\u201cI get\n\\$100\u201d})\\) need not be equal to \\(2(\\Des(\\text{\u201cthe chance\nthat I get \\$100 is 0.5\u201d})).\\) (This does not conflict with\nmaximizing expected desirability, because it concerns only the\nrelationship between particular inputs to the \\(\\Des\\) function, and\ndoes not concern the decision-maker\u2019s subjective\nprobabilities.). This proposal can also rationalize the Ellsberg\npreferences\n (section 4.1),\n because it allows the decision-maker to assign different\nprobabilities to the various chance propositions (see also Bradley\n2015).\n\nOther proposals hold that we should reject the aggregation norm of\nexpected utility. The earliest of these came from Allais himself, who\nheld that decision-makers care not just about the mean utility of a\ngamble, but also about the dispersion of values. He proposes that\nindividuals maximize expected utility plus a measure of the riskiness\nof a gamble, which consists in a multiple of the standard deviation of\nthe gamble and a multiple of its skewness. Formally, if \\(s\\) stands\nfor the standard deviation of \\(L\\) and \\(m\\) stands for the skewness\nof \\(L,\\) then the utility value of \\(L\\) will be (Allais 1953, Hagen\n1979): \n\n\\[\\text{AH}(L) = \\EU(L) + F(s, m/s^2) + \\varepsilon\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\varepsilon\\) is an error term. He thus proposes that\nriskiness is an independently valuable property of a gamble, to be\ncombined with (and traded off against) its expected utility. This\nproposal essentially treats the riskiness of a gamble as a property\nthat is (dis)valuable in itself (see also Nozick 1993 on symbolic\nutility).\n\nA final approach treats global sensitivity as a feature of the\ndecision-maker\u2019s way of aggregating utility values. It might be\nthat a decision-maker\u2019s utility and probability function are not\nyet enough to tell us what he should prefer; he must also decide how\nmuch weight to give to what happens in worse states versus what\nhappens in better states. In risk-weighted expected utility\n(Buchak 2013), a generalization of Quiggin\u2019s (1982)\nanticipated utility and a member of the rank-dependent family\n(see\n section 4.3.2),\n this decision is represented by his risk function.\n\nFormally, let \\(g' = \\{E_1, x_1;\\ldots; E_n, x_n\\}\\) be a re-ordering\nof act \\(g\\) from worst event to best event, so that \\(u(x_1) \\le\n\\ldots \\le u(x_n).\\) Then the risk-weighted expected utility\nof \\(g\\) is: \n\n\\[\n\\REU (g') = u(x_{1}) + \\sum_{i = 2}^{n} r\n\\left(\\sum_{j = i}^{n} p(E_{j})\\right) \\left(u(x_{i}) - u( x_{i - 1})\\right)\\]\n\n\nwith \\(0 \\le r(p) \\le 1,\\) \\(r(0) = 0\\) and \\(r(1) = 1,\\) and \\(r(p)\\)\nnon-decreasing.\n\nThe risk function measures the weight of the top \\(p\\)-portion of\nconsequences in the evaluation of an act\u2014how much the\ndecision-maker cares about benefits that obtain only in the top\n\\(p\\)-portion of states. (One could also think of the risk function as\ndescribing the solution to a distributive justice problem among\none\u2019s future possible selves\u2014it says how much weight a\ndecision-maker gives to the interests of the top \\(p\\)-portion of his\nfuture possible selves.) A risk-avoidant person is someone\nwith a convex risk function: as benefits obtain in a smaller and\nsmaller portion of states, he gives proportionally less and less\nweight to them. A risk-inclined person is someone with a\nconcave risk function. And a globally neutral person is\nsomeone with a linear risk function, i.e., an EU maximizer.\n\nDiminishing marginal value and global sensitivity are captured,\nrespectively, by the utility function and the risk function.\nFurthermore, the Allais preferences can be accommodated by a convex\nrisk function (Segal 1987, Prelec 1998, Buchak 2013; but see Thoma\n& Weisberg 2017). Thus, REU maximization holds that\ndecision-makers have the Allais preferences because they care more\nabout what happens in worse scenarios than better scenarios, or are\nmore concerned with the minimum value than potential gains above the\nminimum.\n\nThe representation theorem for REU combines conditions from two\nexisting theorems (Machina & Schmeidler 1992, K\u00f6bberling and\nWakker 2003), replacing the separability condition with two weaker\nconditions. One of these conditions fixes a unique probability\nfunction of events (Machina & Schmeidler\u2019s \u201cStrong\nComparative Probability\u201d, 1992) and the other fixes a unique\nrisk function of probabilities; the latter is a restricted version of\nthe separability condition (K\u00f6bberling & Wakker\u2019s\n[2003] \u201cComonotonic\u201d Tradeoff Consistency; see\n section 4.3.2).\n Since the representation theorem derives a unique probability\nfunction, a unique risk function, and a unique (up to positive affine\ntransformation) utility function, it separates the contribution of\ndiminishing marginal value and global sensitivity to a given\npreference ordering. One can disprefer mean-preserving spreads as a\nresult of either type of risk-aversion, or a combination of both.\n",
