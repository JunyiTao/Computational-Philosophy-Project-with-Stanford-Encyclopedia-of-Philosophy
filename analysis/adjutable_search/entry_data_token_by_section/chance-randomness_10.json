    "main_text": "Chance Without Randomness || Bias\n4.3 Bias\n\n\nThe two previous problems notwithstanding, many have found the most\ncompelling cases of chance without randomness to be situations in which\nthere is a biased chance process. A sequence of unfair coin tosses will\nhave an unbalanced number of heads and tails, and such a sequence\ncannot be random. But such a sequence, and any particular outcome in\nthat sequence, happens by chance.\n\n\nThat such sequences aren\u2019t random can be seen by using both\nMartin-L\u00f6f- and Kolmogorov-style considerations. In the latter\ncase, as we have already seen, a biased sequence will be more\ncompressible than an unbiased sequence, if the sequence is long enough,\nbecause an efficient coding will exploit the fact that biased sequences\nwill typically have longer subsequences of consecutive digits, and\nhence will not be random. In the former case, a biased sequence will\nviolate at least one measure one property, on the standard Lebesgue\nmeasure on infinite binary sequences\u2014in particular, a measure one\n subset of the Cantor space will be Borel normal\n (\u00a72.1),\n but no biased sequence is Borel normal. So on the\nstandard account of randomness, no sequences of outcomes of a biased\nchance process are random, but of course these outcomes happened by\nchance.\n\n\nOne response to this problem is to try and come up with a\ncharacterisation of randomness which will permit the outcomes of\nbiased chances to be random. It is notable that von Mises\u2019 initial\ncharacterisation of randomness was expressly constructed with this in\nmind\u2014for him, a random sequence is one for which there is no\nadmissible subsequence having a frequency differing from the frequency\nin the original sequence. This account is able to handle any value for\nthe frequency, not only the case where each of two outcomes are\nequifrequent. Given that the Martin-L\u00f6f approach is a\ngeneralisation of von Mises\u2019, it is not surprising that it too can be\nadapted to permit biased sequences to be random. Consider a binary\nprocess with outcome probabilities \\((p, 1 - p)\\). The law of large numbers in a general form tells\nus that a measure one set of sequences of independent trials of such a\nprocess will have limit frequencies of outcomes equal to \\((p, 1 - p)\\). This measure is not the standard Lebesgue\nmeasure, but rather a measure defined by the chance function in\nquestion. We can similarly re-interpret the other effective\nstatistical tests of randomness. Drawing as we did above\n(\u00a72.1.2) on the language of statistical\ntesting, we can characterise the random sequences as those which are\nnot significant with respect to the hypothesis that the outcome\nchances are \\((p, 1 - p)\\)\u2014those which, as\nit were, conform to our prior expectations based on the underlying\nchances.\n\n\nTo approach the topic of randomness of biased sequences through\nKolmogorov complexity, suppose we are given\u2014somehow\u2014any\ncomputable probability measure \\(\\lambda\\) over the set of infinite\nbinary sequences (that is, the probability of a given sequence can be\napproximated arbitrarily well by a recursive function). A sequence\n\\(\\sigma\\) is \\(\\lambda\\)-incompressible iff for each \\(n\\), the\nKolmogorov complexity of the length \\(n\\) initial subsequence of\n\\(\\sigma\\) (denoted \\(\\sigma_n )\\) is greater than or\nequal to \\({-}\\log_2 (\\lambda(\\sigma_n ))\\). Where \\(\\lambda\\) is the\nLebesgue measure\n(supplement B.2), it\nfollows that\n\n\\[\n{-}\\log_2 (\\lambda(\\sigma_n )) = {-}\\log_2 (1/2^n ) = n,\n\\]\n\n\nso we get back the original\ndefinition of Kolmogorov complexity in that special case. With this\ngeneralised definition of Kolmogorov randomness in hand, it turns out\nthat we can show a generalisation of Schnorr\u2019s theorem\n(\u00a72.3): a sequence \\(\\sigma\\) is\n\\(\\lambda\\)-incompressible iff \\(\\sigma\\) is ML-random with respect to\n\\(\\lambda\\).[15] In\nthe framework of\nsupplement B.1.1, a\nsequence is ML-random in this generalised sense iff the measure, under\nour arbitrary computable measure \\(\\lambda\\), of the \\(n\\)th\nsequential significance test is no greater than\n\\(1/2^n\\). (There are some potential pitfalls,\nsuggesting that perhaps the generalisation to an arbitrary computable\nmeasure is an overgeneralisation: see\nsupplement B.1.3 for\nsome details.)\n\n\nWhile the above approach, with the modifications suggestion in the\nsupplement taken on board, does permit biased random sequences, it\ncomes at a cost. While the Lebesgue measure is a natural one that is\ndefinable on the Cantor space of sequences directly, the\ngeneralisation of ML-randomness requires an independent computable\nprobability measure on the space of sequences to be provided. While\nthis may be done in cases where we antecedently know the chances, it\nis of no use in circumstances where the existence of chance is to be\ninferred from the existence of a random sequence of outcomes, in line\nwith RCT\u2014for every sequence there is some chance measure\naccording to which it is random, which threatens to trivialise the\ninference from randomness to chance. As Earman (1986: 145) also\nemphasises, this approach to randomness seems to require essentially\nthat the chanciness of the process producing the random sequence is\nconceptually prior to the sequence being random. This kind of process\napproach to randomness has some intuitive support, and we will return\nto it below (\u00a76.2), but it risks turning RCT\ninto an uninformative triviality. By contrast, the Lebesgue measure\nhas the advantage of being intrinsically definable from the\nsymmetries of the Cantor space, a feature other computable measures\nlack.\n\n\nThe main difficulty with the suggested generalisation to biased\nsequences lies in the simple fact that biased sequences, while they\nmight reflect the probabilities in the process which produces them,\nsimply don\u2019t seem to be random in the sense of disorderly and\nincompressible. The generalisation above shows that we can define a\nnotion of disorderliness that is relative to the probabilities\nunderlying the sequence, but that is not intrinsic to the sequence\nitself independently of whatever measure we are considering. As Earman\nputs it (in slightly misleading terminology): \n\n[T]here is a concept of randomness and a separable concept of\ndisorder. The concept of disorder is an intrinsic notion; it takes the\nsequence at face value, caring nothing for genesis, and asks whether\nthe sequence lacks pattern.\u2026 By contrast, the concept of\nrandomness is concerned with genesis; it does not take the sequence at\nface value but asks whether the sequence mirrors the probabilities of\nthe process of which it is a product. There is a connection between\nthis concept of randomness and the concept of disorder, but it is not\na tight one. (Earman 1986: 145)\nAs we might put it: Kolmogorov randomness is conceptually linked to\ndisorderliness, and while we can gerry-rig a notion of \u2018biased\ndisorder\u2019, that doesn\u2019t really answer to what we already know\nabout the incompressibility of disorderly sequences. While we might\nwell regard a sequence featuring even numbers of heads and tails, but\nproduced by successive tosses of an unfair coin, to be biased\nin some sense with respect to the underlying measure of process behind\nit, it is still plausible that this unrepresentativeness of\nthe sequence isn\u2019t conceptually connected with disorder in any\ninteresting sense. It is very intuitive, as this remark from Dasgupta\nsuggests, to take that biasedness\u2014the increased orderliness of\nthe sequence\u2014to contrast with randomness:\n\nif for a sequence \\(x\\) this limiting frequency exists but is not\nequal to 1/2, then, in view of our underlying fair coin\nmodel, \\(x\\) would clearly be biased, not random. \u2026 Thus,\nit is natural to view this \u2018stochastic law of\nunbiasedness\u2019 as a \u2018stochastic law of\nrandomness\u2019. (Dasgupta 2011: \u00a73.2)\n\n\n\nAs the bias in a chance process approaches extremal values, it is very\nnatural to reject the idea that the observed outcomes are random. (As\nan example, we may consider human behaviour\u2014while people aren\u2019t\nperfectly predictable, and apparently our behaviour doesn\u2019t obey\nnon-probabilistic psychological laws, nevertheless to say that people\nact randomly is incorrect.) Moreover, there is a relatively\nmeasure-independent notion of disorder or incompressibility of\nsequences, such that biased sequences really are less disorderly. We\ncan define a measure-dependent notion of disorder for biased sequences\nonly by ignoring the availability of better compression techniques\nthat really do compress biased sequences more than unbiased ones. To\ngeneralise the notion of randomness, as proposed above, permits highly\nnon-random sequences to be called random as long as they reflect the\nchances of highly biased processes. So there is at least some\nintuitive pull towards the idea that if randomness does bifurcate as\nEarman suggests, the best deserver of the name is Kolmogorov\nrandomness in its original sense. But this will be a sense that\ncontrasts with the natural generalisation of ML-randomness to deal\nwith arbitrary computable probability measures, and similarly\ncontrasts with the original sense of randomness that von Mises must\nhave been invoking in his earliest discussions of randomness in the\nfoundations of probability.\nIn light of the above discussion, while there has been progress on\ndefining randomness for biased sequences in a general and\ntheoretically robust way, there remain difficulties in using that\nnotion in defence of any non-trivial version of RCT, and difficulties\nin general with the idea that biased sequences can be genuinely\ndisorderly. But the generalisation invoked here does give some succour\nto von Mises, for a robust notion of randomness for biased sequences\nis a key ingredient of his form of frequentism.\n\n",
