    "main_text": "A Priori Justification and Late 20th Century Naturalism || Analytic Naturalism\n4.2 Analytic Naturalism\n\nCornell realism holds that moral properties cannot be a\npriori analyzed as any natural properties, though they can be\nempirically discovered to be identical to certain natural properties.\nIn contrast, analytic naturalism holds that moral properties can be\nanalyzed in terms of natural properties. One influential version of\nanalytic naturalism applies to moral properties a strategy that was\ndeveloped for dealing with mental properties, which is why the view is\nalso called moral functionalism, flagging the similarity to\nfunctionalism in the philosophy of mind. We will focus on this version\nof analytic naturalism, specifically Frank Jackson\u2019s (1998)\nexposition. (For another version see Stephen Finlay 2014.)\n\nTo a first approximation, analytic naturalism holds the following:\nThere are many statements containing moral terms that we find obvious\nor intuitive\u2014moral platitudes, if you will. These statements\nconstitute a sort of folk moral theory. Here are some examples:\n\u201cintentional killing is normally wrong\u201d, \u201cpain is\nbad\u201d, \u201cvirtuous people are more likely to do the right\nthing than vicious people\u201d, \u201ca person who judges that she\nought to do something normally feels some motivation to do it\u201d.\nCollectively, such statements fix the reference of moral terms, i.e.,\nthey determine what moral terms refer to. If a person denied enough of\nthese statements, we would conclude that the person did not use moral\nterms with the same meaning as the rest of us. According to analytic\nnaturalism, moral terms have their meaning holistically, as a result\nof the role they play in the system of moral statements that make up\nfolk morality. Significantly, many of these statements relate moral\nproperties to each other, as does the statement that virtuous people\nare more likely to do the right thing.\n\nThere is an immediate problem. Since current folk morality is made up\nof all the moral statements that many people find obvious, given the\nlevel of moral disagreement, folk morality is unlikely to be\nconsistent. If it contains inconsistent statements folk morality will\nnot be able to determine the reference of moral terms, since an\ninconsistent description does not apply to anything. Moreover, parts\nof it that seem obvious to many people are likely to be grounded in\nsuperstitions, depend upon empirical views that are mistaken, and in\nvarious other ways not be able to stand up to critical reflection. So\ncurrent folk morality must be cleaned up. One way to think about\ncleaning up folk morality is as trying to bring it into reflective\nequilibrium. But however it is done, the point is to mold current folk\nmorality into a coherent, reflectively defensible system of moral\nbeliefs: a mature folk morality. Analytic naturalism claims that the\nmeaning of moral terms is given by the role they occupy in the\nstatements that constitute mature folk morality.\n\nTo see more specifically how this works, imagine writing down all the\nstatements of mature folk morality as one long conjunction.\nSimplifying, suppose mature folk morality consists of only the first\nthree examples above:\n\n\nIntentional killing is normally wrong and pain is\nbad and virtuous people are more likely to do the right thing\nthan vicious people. \n\n\nWe can transform these statements so that they explicitly reference\nmoral properties and replace each moral property term with a distinct\nvariable:\n\n\nIntentional killings normally have the property w and\npain has the property b and people with the\nproperty v1 are more likely to perform actions\nhaving the property r than people having the property\nv2. \n\n\nWe then bind all these variables with existential quantifiers to\nget:\n\n\nThere exists a property w and a property b and a\nproperty v1 and a property r and a property\nv2 such that intentional killings normally have\nthe property w and pain has the property b\nand people with the property v1 are more likely\nto perform actions having the property r than people having the\nproperty v2. \n\n\nWe now have a sentence that says there are five properties that\nfulfill the roles played by the moral properties we began with. But\nthat\u2019s not good enough to single out moral properties by their\nplaying these roles, since there might be other properties that also\nplay these roles. To exclude this possibility, we need to add a claim\nsaying that only one property plays each role, i.e., a clause that\nstates that any property that makes all the statements containing\nw true is identical to w, any property that makes all\nthe sentences containing b true is identical to b, and\nso on. We can abbreviate this clause as Uniqueness. It is now\npossible to define any moral term using the complicated sentence we\nhave just constructed. For example:\n\n\nWrongness is the property w such that: there exists a property\nb and a property v1 and a property r\nand a property v2 such that intentional killings\nnormally have the property w and pain has the property\nb and people with the property v1\nare more likely to perform actions having the property r than\npeople having the property v2 and\nUniqueness. \n\n\nThe claim that this simple statement correctly analyzes wrongness is\nnot very plausible. But that is because we simplified, including only\nthree statements from mature folk morality. Analytic naturalism holds\nthat the extremely complex sentences constructed in the same way using\nall of mature folk morality provide analyses of moral terms.\nThis position is much more plausible, although still\ncontroversial.\n\nOne might at this point question why the analyses of moral terms\nanalytic naturalism constructs would be naturalistic, i.e., define\nmoral terms in purely \u201cdescriptive\u201d terms, given that the\nroles played by moral terms are partly determined by their relations\nto other moral terms. A crucial element of the view that we must now\nexplain addresses this question. Analytic naturalism holds that a\ncentral tenet of folk morality is that moral properties\nsupervene on natural properties. This means that it is\nimpossible for two situations to differ morally without there also\nbeing some natural difference. Jackson argues that the supervenience\nof the moral on the natural, or as he prefers, on the\n\u201cdescriptive\u201d, entails that moral properties are natural\nproperties.\n\nTake any ethical statement E. Since moral properties are\nsupervenient or consequent upon descriptive properties, no\npossible world where E is true can be made up only of moral\nfacts. There will also have to be descriptive facts about this world,\nso there will be a sentence, likely an extremely long and complex\nsentence, that completely specifies the descriptive facts about the\nworld. There will be such a purely descriptive sentence for every\npossible world where E is true. Let these sentences be\nD1, D2, D3,\n\u2026 We can disjoin all these descriptive sentences to get\nD = (D1 or D2 or\nD3 or \u2026). D will also be a descriptive\nsentence; it is made up entirely of descriptive sentences put together\nusing \u201cor\u201d, which is not a moral term.\n\nNow, although it is an odd sentence\u2014a very long\ndisjunction\u2014there is an important fact about D: it\nentails E and it is entailed by E. If E is true,\nthen one of the disjuncts of D must be true, because D\ncontains a disjunct describing every world where E is true;\nhence, D will be true as well. On the other hand, if D\nis true, then one of its disjuncts must be true, say it is\nDn. E could not be false in a world\ndescribed by Dn because\nDn is included as a disjunct of D.\nHence, if E were false in a world described by\nDn it would be possible for there to be two\nworlds that were exactly alike in all descriptive respects with the\nmoral statement E being true in one of these worlds but false\nin the other. The supervenience of the moral on the descriptive tells\nus that this cannot happen\u2014there can be no moral difference\nunless there is some descriptive difference. So D entails\nE.\n\nJackson concludes,\n\n\nThe same line of argument can be applied mutatis mutandis to\nethical and descriptive predicates and open sentences: for any ethical\npredicate there is a purely descriptive one that is necessarily\nco-extensive with it. \n\n\n\nIt follows that ethical properties are descriptive properties. (1998:\n122\u2013123) \n\n\nOne could question Jackson\u2019s assumption that necessarily\nco-extensive properties are the same, but we cannot here pursue that\nissue. What analytical naturalism offers so far is an analysis of\nmoral terms and an argument that moral properties are natural, or\ndescriptive. But exactly which descriptive properties are identical to\nthe moral properties? Analytic naturalism does not tell us this now.\nIt claims that once we have attained a mature folk morality, we will\nbe able to determine which natural properties fulfill (closely enough)\nthe roles of the various moral\n properties.[7]\n\nGiven that analytic naturalism provides analyses of moral\nterms\u2014more exactly, a procedure for constructing such analyses\nonce we have a mature folk morality\u2014one might conclude that\nvarious moral propositions will be a priori justified, most\nsignificantly, the definitions of moral terms. Jackson claims as much.\nExplaining the \u201ca priori\u201d supervenience of moral\non descriptive properties, e.g., he writes, \n\n\nIt is an implicit part \u2026 of our understanding of ethical terms\nand sentences that they serve to mark distinctions among the\ndescriptive ways things are. (1998: 125) \n\n\nHe also claims that the characterization of the role played by\nrightness and the other moral terms in mature folk morality is a\npriori while the identification of exactly which natural\nproperties play these roles is a posteriori, since this would\nrequire empirical investigation. Jackson describes mature folk\nmorality as \n\n\nthe best we will do by way of making good sense of the raft of\nsometimes conflicting intuitions about particular cases and general\nprinciples that make up current folk morality. (1998: 133) \n\n\nMature folk morality is just the result of subjecting current folk\nmorality to sustained critical reflection.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that although Jackson\u2019s description\nof the status of the supervenience of the moral on the natural is\nsuggestive, he does not explicitly claim that even this is\nself-evident. Although his descriptions of folk morality, e.g., as\n\n\n\nthe network of moral opinions, intuitions, principles and concepts\nwhose mastery is part and parcel of having a sense of what is right\nand wrong, and of being able to engage in meaningful debate about what\nought to be done (1998: 130) \n\n\nsuggest that one could determine, a priori, the content of\nfolk morality, folk morality is also clearly something held by a\ncommunity of people rather than an individual. This suggests that\nempirical inquiry would be needed to determine what belongs to the\nfolk morality of a community, including even the community to which\none belongs. Finally, there is the critical reflection that produces\nmature folk morality. Jackson does not describe this reflection in\nmuch detail. He mentions reflective equilibrium as one example, but\nreflective equilibrium is understood in various ways, and most include\nempirical elements. So while there are some reasons to think\nanalytical naturalism allows for significant a priori moral\njustification and knowledge, there are also grounds for doubt. (For an\nargument that analytic naturalists must make use of a priori\nequivalences between moral and descriptive features, see Smith\n2000.)\n",
