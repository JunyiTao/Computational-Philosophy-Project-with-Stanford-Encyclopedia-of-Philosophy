    "main_text": "Dao and Cosmos || Cosmology\n4.4 Cosmology\n\nAfter the cosmos is generated, it is subject to the laws of cosmology.\nThe Chinese cosmological system\u2014often called \u201ccorrelative\ncosmology\u201d by Western scholars\u2014is a structured and\ncoherent corpus of knowledge that uses abstract emblems\n(xiang, lit. \u201cimages\u201d) to analyze and explain the\nfeatures of the cosmic domain and the relations that occur among its\ncomponents (Schwartz 1985: 350\u201382; Graham 1989: 319\u201356;\nKalinowski 1991). Among the main emblems are the following:\n\n The Northern Dipper (beidou, Ursa Major), which\nrepresents the center and the unity of the cosmos. Through its\napparent rotation around itself, the Dipper distributes its vital\nenergy (or \u201cbreath\u201d, qi) throughout the compass\nof space and the cycles of time.\n Yin and Yang, which are the main emblems of\nduality. They denote the two complementary forces\u2014one\n\u201cpositive\u201d, the other \u201cnegative\u201d\u2014that\nperform two main functions: they generate entities and phenomena\nthrough their conjunction, and they regulate the functioning of the\ncosmos through their cyclical alternation.\n The five agents (or five phases, wuxing), which serve to\nclassify and relate items belonging to different domains to one\nanother. Their names are Wood (mu), Fire (huo), Soil\n(tu), Metal (jin), and Water (shui). The\nagent Wood, for instance, classifies the direction east, the season\nspring, the numbers 3 and 8, the color green (or blue), the planet\nJupiter, the organ liver, and the acoustic phenomenon jue in\nthe same category. Four of the five agents also represent different\nstates of Yin and Yang: \u201cminor\nYang\u201d (Wood), \u201cgreat Yang\u201d (Fire),\n\u201cminor Yin\u201d (Metal), and \u201cgreat\nYin\u201d (Water). In the Daoist view, the five agents\nemblematize different modes or states taken on by the Original Breath\n(yuanqi) or the One Breath (yiqi) of the Dao in the\ncosmos. The function of the fifth agent, Soil, is especially\nimportant: being placed at the center, Soil stands for the source from\nwhich the other four agents derive, and guarantees the conjunction of\nthe world of multiplicity to Unity.\n The eight trigrams of the Yijing (Book of Changes),\nwhich are formed by different combinations of three broken\n(Yin) or solid (Yang) lines. Their names are\nZhen \u2633, Li \u2632, Dui \u2631,\nQian \u2630, Xun \u2634, Kan \u2635,\nGen \u2636, and Kun \u2637. The trigrams are\nrelated to divination practices, but their primary use in Daoism is\npurely emblematic; in particular, they represent different states of\nYin and Yang. With regard to space, for instance,\nthe trigrams refer to the directions; in this case, four of them\nrepresent the cardinal directions (just like four of the five agents),\nand the other four represent the intermediate directions.\n\n\nIn addition to those mentioned above, Daoist traditions draw several\nother images, concepts, and terms from the standard Chinese\ncosmological system, but one point requires mention. Cosmology\nprovides Daoism with tools to represent the unfolding of Unity into\nmultiplicity; to express the relation between Dao, cosmos, and human\nbeing; and to frame practices supported by microcosmic\nframeworks\u2014the ritual area, the alchemical laboratory, or the\nhuman body itself. These practices aim to provide means for\n\u201creturning to the Dao\u201d. This implies that, while the\nemblems of cosmology are suitable to represent the differentiation of\nUnity into the \u201cten thousand things\u201d, they also serve as\npointers for reverting from the \u201cten thousand things\u201d to\nUnity. To give one example, alchemists often represent the return to\nUnity as the reduction of the five agents to three and then to\none.\n",
