    "main_text": "The Microfoundations Debate\n3. The Microfoundations Debate\n\nThe microfoundations debate gained prominence around the beginning of\nthe 1980s when a number of philosophers and social scientists began to\ndefend the view that purely holist explanations, as they may be\ntermed, should be supplemented by an account of the underlying\nindividual-level mechanisms. Jon Elster and Daniel Little, among\nothers, argued in favor of this view in the context of Marxist social\ntheorizing (Elster 1983, 1985, 1989; Little 1986, 1991, 1998). Raymond\nBoudon was also an early and important proponent (Boudon 1976, 1979).\nTheir contention that social theorists must pay attention to\nindividual-level microfoundations was soon met by opposition from\nmethodological holists, and a debate developed. Within current\nphilosophical discussions, the advocacy of the methodological\nindividualist stance is often associated with the approach of\nanalytical sociology or with key representatives thereof\n(Hedstr\u00f6m 2005; Hedstr\u00f6m and Swedberg 1996; Demeulenaere\n2011). Yet the view is also defended by others, both from within and\noutside sociology. Arguments in support of the opposing holist stance\nare not tied to any specific approach within the social sciences or\nphilosophy.\n\nThere are two basic positions within the microfoundations debate:\n\n\nMethodological holism: Purely holist explanations may\nsometimes stand on their own; they need not always be supplemented by\naccounts of the underlying individual-level microfoundations.\n\nMethodological individualism: Purely holist explanations may\nnever stand on their own; they should always be supplemented by\naccounts of the underlying individual-level microfoundations.\n\n\nThe debate may be further characterized by considering its key\nnotions, possible qualifications of the individualist stance, and the\nstandard motivation behind the demand for microfoundations.\n\nTo begin, purely holist explanations are ones in which both the\nexplanans and the explanandum are expressed in terms of social\nphenomena. They are exemplified by claims such as \u201cthe\nprotestant ethic caused the rise of capitalism in Western\nEurope\u201d, or \u201cthe country\u2019s high economic growth was\npartly due to its stable political environment\u201d. Drawing on the\ndiscussion of holist explanations in connection with the\ndispensability debate, the explanans and explanandum may be said to be\nin terms of social phenomena when they contain social terms,\ndescriptions, or predicates set apart by their reference to, and focus\non, social phenomena. In turn, social phenomena may then be specified\nas social entities, social processes and social properties as\nexemplified by universities, revolutions, the literacy rate, and so\non. Moreover, it is possible to distinguish between different types of\npurely holist explanation. For instance, purely holist explanations\nmay be classified according to whether they are of the functional,\nintentional, or straightforward causal type, as introduced above. Or,\npurely holist explanations may be individuated according to their\nfocus on, say, organizations, the statistical properties of groups,\netc.\n\nTurn now to the accounts of the individual-level microfoundations.\nThese are specifications of the underlying individual-level mechanisms\nunderstood as causal chains of events, that occur at the level of\nindividuals, and that link some cause in the form of a social\nphenomenon to its effect in the form of another social phenomenon.\nVery often, accounts of this sort are taken to consist of three parts.\nPart I lays out how a social phenomenon resulted in individuals\nforming various beliefs and desires, and having certain opportunities.\nPart II states how these beliefs, desires, and opportunities gave rise\nto individuals acting and interacting in a certain manner. Part III\noutlines how these actions and interactions, intentionally or\nunintentionally, brought about a certain social phenomenon. As an\nillustration of an account along these lines, consider the example of\nthe purely holist explanation that \u201cthe protestant ethic caused\nthe rise of capitalism in the West\u201d. A very rough three-part\naccount of the underlying individual-level mechanisms might go as\nfollows. The protestant ethic compelled individuals to adopt certain\nvalues. These, in turn, induced them to engage in certain new forms of\neconomic behavior. Those, finally, caused the rise of capitalism in\nthe West. Frequently, Coleman\u2019s well-known boat model is used to\ndepict how purely holist explanations must include such three-part\naccounts of the underlying individual-level mechanisms (Coleman 1986,\n1990). The model uses a boat form to illustrate the move from one\nsocial phenomenon down to individual-level events and up again to\nanother social phenomenon.\n\nAs may already be clear, the accounts of the underlying mechanisms are\nindividual-level accounts in the sense that they invariably contain\ndescriptions of what happens to, and what is made to happen by,\nindividuals. It is standard to invoke descriptions of individuals by\nreference to their roles and other properties they possess as a result\nof being part of social organizations. In this sense, a permissive\nnotion as to what counts as individual-level descriptions is endorsed.\nThe accounts of individuals may draw on different theories of the\nactor. In earlier phases of the debate, there was a clear tendency to\nbase the accounts on rational-choice models. Today, other models are\nused as well.\n\nThe claim that purely holist explanations are in need of\nmicrofoundations may be qualified in various ways. Sometimes, it is\nmade clear that purely holist explanations should always be\naccompanied by accounts of the underlying individual-level mechanisms.\nVery often, this position is motivated by appeal to the\n\u201cmechanism model\u201d of explanation. It states that to\nexplain is to show how one phenomenon, via underlying mechanisms,\nbrought about another phenomenon; to borrow Elster\u2019s words, to\nexplain is \u201cto provide a mechanism, to open up the black box and\nshow the nuts and bolts, the cogs and wheels\u201d (Elster 1985: 5).\nAccordingly, purely holist explanations do not actually constitute\nexplanations unless they are supplemented by accounts of the\nunderlying individual-level mechanisms. In other instances, it is only\nheld that purely holist explanations must be supplemented by accounts\nof the underlying individual-level mechanisms in order to qualify as\nsatisfying or complete explanations. This view is\ncommonly motivated by a weaker version of the mechanism model of\nexplanation, according to which a satisfactory or complete\nexplanation, rather than an explanation as such, must describe how one\nphenomenon, via underlying mechanisms, brought about another.\n\nHowever qualified, the assertion that purely holist explanations are\nalways in need of microfoundations is a weaker form of methodological\nindividualism than the one defended within the indispensability\ndispute. Methodological individualists who are engaged in the\nmicrofoundations debate do not insist that holist explanations should\nbe dispensed with. The target is only purely holist explanations,\ni.e., ones in which both the explanans and the explanandum are\nexpressed in terms of social phenomena, and it is simply held that\nthese explanations are in need of supplementation by accounts of\nindividual-level mechanisms. Also, there is no objection to the use of\nholist explanations in which the explanans is stated in terms of\nsocial phenomena and the explanandum is described in terms of\nindividuals, their actions, etc. In fact, explanations along these\nlines are offered as part of the accounts of the individual-level\nmechanisms when it is specified how a social phenomenon resulted in\nindividuals forming various beliefs and desires, and having certain\nopportunities. Even though the demand for microfoundations is a weaker\nform of methodological individualism, the position has nonetheless met\nwith opposition. As noted, methodological holists who are engaged in\nthe microfoundations debate insist that purely holist explanations may\nsometimes stand on their own in that they need not be supplemented by\naccounts of the individual-level mechanisms; purely holist\nexplanations qualify as explanations, or as satisfying or complete\nexplanations.\n",
