The Possibility of Time Travel Redux\n\nThe toy models above all treat billiard balls, fields, and other\nobjects propagating through a background spacetime with CTCs. Even if\nwe can show that a consistent solution exists, there is a further\nquestion: what kind of matter and dynamics could generate CTCs to\nbegin with? There are various solutions of Einstein\u2019s equations\nwith CTCs, but how do these exotic spacetimes relate to the models\nactually used in describing the world? In other words, what positive\nreasons might we have to take CTCs seriously as a feature of the\nactual universe, rather than an exotic possibility of primarily\nmathematical interest?\n\nWe should distinguish two different kinds of \u201cpossibility\u201d\nthat we might have in mind in posing such questions (following Stein\n1970). First, we can consider a solution as a candidate cosmological\nmodel, describing the (large-scale gravitational degrees of freedom of\nthe) entire universe. The case for ruling out spacetimes with CTCs as\npotential cosmological models strikes us as, surprisingly, fairly\nweak. Physicists used to simply rule out solutions with CTCs as\nunreasonable by fiat, due to the threat of paradoxes, which we have\ndismantled above. But it is also challenging to make an observational\ncase. Observations tell us very little about global features, such as\nthe existence of CTCs, because signals can only reach an observer from\na limited region of spacetime, called the past light cone. Our past\nlight cone\u2014and indeed the collection of all the past light cones\nfor possible observers in a given spacetime\u2014can be embedded in\nspacetimes with quite different global features (Malament 1977,\nManchak 2009). This undercuts the possibility of using observations to\nconstrain global topology, including (among other things) ruling out\nthe existence of CTCs.\n\nYet the case in favor of taking cosmological models with CTCs\nseriously is also not particularly strong. Some solutions used to\ndescribe black holes, which are clearly relevant in a variety of\nastrophysical contexts, include CTCs. But the question of whether the\nCTCs themselves play an essential representational role is subtle: the\nCTCs arise in the maximal extensions of these solutions, and can\nplausibly be regarded as extraneous to successful applications.\nFurthermore, many of the known solutions with CTCs have symmetries,\nraising the possibility that CTCs are not a stable or robust feature.\nSlight departures from symmetry may lead to a solution without CTCs,\nsuggesting that the CTCs may be an artifact of an idealized model.\n\nThe second sense of possibility regards whether\n\u201creasonable\u201d initial conditions can be shown to lead to,\nor not to lead to, the formation of CTCs. As with the toy models\nabove, suppose that we have a partial Cauchy surface \\(S\\), such that\nall the temporal funny business lies to the future. Rather than simply\nassuming that there is a region with CTCs to the future, we can ask\ninstead whether it is possible to create CTCs by manipulating\nmatter in the initial, well-behaved region\u2014that is, whether it\nis possible to build a time machine. Several physicists have pursued\n\u201cchronology protection theorems\u201d aiming to show that the\ndynamics of general relativity (or some other aspects of physics)\nrules this out, and to clarify why this is the case. The proof of such\na theorem would justify neglecting solutions with CTCs as a source of\ninsight into the nature of time in the actual world. But as of yet\nthere are several partial results that do not fully settle the\nquestion. One further intriguing possibility is that even if general\nrelativity by itself does protect chronology, it may not be possible\nto formulate a sensible theory describing matter and fields in\nsolutions with CTCs. (See SEP entry on Time Machines; Smeenk and\nW\u00fcthrich 2011 for more.)\n\nThere is a different question regarding the limitations of these toy\nmodels. The toy models and related examples show that there are\nconsistent solutions for simple systems in the presence of CTCs. As\nusual we have made the analysis tractable by building toy models,\nselecting only a few dynamical degrees of freedom and tracking their\nevolution. But there is a large gap between the systems we have\ndescribed and the time travel stories they evoke, with Kurt traveling\nalong a CTC with murderous intentions. In particular, many features of\nthe manifest image of time are tied to the thermodynamical properties\nof macroscopic systems. Rovelli (unpublished) considers a extremely\nsimple system to illustrate the problem: can a clock move along a CTC?\nA clock consists of something in periodic motion, such as a pendulum\nbob, and something that counts the oscillations, such as an escapement\nmechanism. The escapement mechanism cannot work without friction; this\nrequires dissipation and increasing entropy. For a clock that counts\noscillations as it moves along a time-like trajectory, the entropy\nmust be a monotonically increasing function. But that is obviously\nincompatible with the clock returning to precisely the same state at\nsome future time as it completes a loop. The point generalizes,\nobviously, to imply that anything like a human, with memory and\nagency, cannot move along a CTC.\n",
