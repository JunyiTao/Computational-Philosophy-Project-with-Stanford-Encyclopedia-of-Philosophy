    "main_text": "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) || General Theorems of Boole\u2019s Algebra in MAL\n3.8 General Theorems of Boole\u2019s Algebra in MAL\n\n\nBeginning with the chapter Properties of Elective Functions, Boole \ndeveloped general theorems for working with elective functions and equations\n in his algebra of logic\u2014the Expansion (or Development) \nTheorem (described above in Section 3.5) and the properties of constituents \nare discussed in this chapter. \nHe used the power series expansion of an elective function in his proof of the \none-variable \ncase of the Expansion Theorem (MAL, p. 60), perhaps intending to apply it \nto rational elective functions. \n\nThe operation of division with polynomial \nfunctions was introduced in MAL but never successfully developed \nin his algebra of logic\u2014there are no equational \nlaws for how to deal with division. It was abandoned in LT \nexcept for being \nfrequently used as a mnemonic device when solving a polynomial equation. \n \nFrom the Expansion Theorem and the properties of constituents he showed that the\nmodulii of the sum/difference/product of two elective functions are\nthe sums/differences/products of the corresponding modulii of the two\nfunctions. \n\n\nThe Expansion Theorem is used (MAL, p. 61) to prove an important result, \nthat p(x) and q(x) are equivalent in Boole\u2019s algebra if and only if corresponding \nmodulii are the same, that is, \\(p(1)=q(1)\\) and \\(p(0)=q(0)\\). This result \ngeneralizes to functions of several variables. It will not be stated as such in \nLT, but will be absorbed in the much more general (if somewhat opaquely \nstated) result that will be called the Rule of 0 and 1.\n\n\nUsing the Expansion Theorem Boole showed (MAL, p. 64)\nthat every elective equation \\(p = 0\\) is equivalent to the collection\nof constituent equations \\(r = 0\\) where the modulus (coefficient) of\n\\(r\\) in the expansion of \\(p\\) is not zero, and thus every\nelective equation is interpretable. Furthermore this led\n(MAL, p. 65) to the fact that \\(p = 0\\) is equivalent to the\nequation \\(q = 0\\) where \\(q\\) is the sum of the constituents in the\nexpansion of \\(p\\) whose modulus is non-zero. \n\n  As examples, consider\nthe equations \\(x + y = 0\\) and \\(x - y = 0\\). The following table\ngives the constituents and modulii of the expansions:\n\n\n\\(x\\)\n\\(y\\)\nconstituents\n\\(x + y\\)\n\\(x - y\\)\n\n\n1\n1\n\\(xy\\)\n2\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n\\(x(1 - y)\\)\n1\n1\n\n\n0\n1\n\\((1 - x)y\\)\n1\n\\(-1\\)\n\n\n0\n0\n\\((1 - x)(1 - y)\\)\n0\n0\n\n\n\nThus \\(x + y = 0\\) is equivalent to the collection of constituent\nequations \n\n\\[\nxy = 0,\\ x(1 - y) = 0,\\ (1 - x)y = 0\n\\]\n\nas well as to the single equation\n\n\\[\nxy + x(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = 0,\n\\]\n\nand \\(x - y = 0\\) is equivalent to the collection of constituent\nequations \n\n\\[\nx(1 - y) = 0,\\ (1 - x)y = 0\n\\]\n\nas well as to the single equation\n\n\\[\nx(1 - y) + (1 - x)y = 0.\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe Solution Theorem described how to solve an elective equation \nfor one of its symbols in terms of the others, often introducing constraint\nequations on the independent variables. In his algebra of logic he could always \nsolve an elective equation for any one of its elective symbols. For example, \nthe equation \\(q(x)y = p(x)\\) was solved by using formal division \n \\(y = p(x)/q(x)\\) and then using formal expansion to obtain \\(y = ax + b(1-x)\\)\nwhere \\(a = p(1)/q(1)\\) and \\(b = p(0)/q(0)\\), and then decoding the\nfractional coefficients. This theorem will be discussed in more detail in \nStep 7 of Section 6.2. \n\n\nBoole\u2019s final example (MAL, p. 78) was solving three\nequations in three unknowns for one of the unknowns in terms of the\nother two.  This example used a well known technique for handling side\nconditions in analysis called Lagrange Multipliers\u2014this method\n(which reduced the three equations in the example to a single equation\nin five unknowns) reappeared in LT (p. 117), but was only\nused once.  It was superseded by the sum of squares reduction\n(LT, p. 121) which does not introduce new variables.  Using\nthe Reduction and Elimination Theorems in LT one discovers\nthat Boole\u2019s constraint equations (3) (MAL, p. 80) for\nhis three equation example are much too weak\u2014each of the\nproducts should be 0, and there are additional constraint equations.\n\n\nMAL shows more clearly than LT how closely Boole\u2019s\nalgebra of logic is based on Common Algebra plus the idempotent law. \nThe Elimination Theorem that he borrowed from common algebra\nturned out to be weaker than what his algebra offered, and his method\nof reducing equations to a single equation was clumsier than the main\none used in LT, but the Expansion Theorem and Solution\nTheorem were the same. One sees that MAL contained not only\nthe basic outline for LT, but also some parts fully\ndeveloped. Power series were not completely abandoned in LT\u2014they\nappeared, but only in a footnote (LT, p. 72).\n",
