    "main_text": "Early Responses || Sommerfeld\n4.1 Sommerfeld\n\nOne of the earliest and most forceful critics of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle was Arnold Sommerfeld (1868\u20131951). As\nDarrigol has recounted in detail, Sommerfeld was never comfortable\nwith Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle, and only begrudgingly\nadmitted its fertility (Darrigol 1992, pp. 138\u2013145). Sommerfeld\npreferred to view quantum theory as a self-contained set of formal\nrules, and wanted to derive the selection rules \u201cby a remarkably\nrigorous manner of deduction, reminiscent of the incontrovertible\nlogic of numerical calculations\u201d (Sommerfeld [1919] 1923, pp.\n265\u2013266). In the first edition of his book Atombau und\nSpektrallinen (Atomic Structure and Spectral Lines)\nSommerfeld disparagingly refers to Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple as a \u201cmagic wand\u201d:\n\nBohr has discovered in his principle of correspondence a\nmagic wand (which he himself calls a formal principle), which allows\nus immediately to make use of the results of the classical wave theory\nin the quantum theory. (Sommereld [1919] 1923, p.\n 275)[8]\n\n\nIn the second edition of Atombau Sommerfeld softens his\ncriticism of the correspondence principle, noting its great fertility.\nIn a letter written to Bohr in November of 1920 Sommerfeld writes,\n\nIn the appendices of my book, you can see that I have taken some pains\nto show the value of your correspondence principle better than in the\n1. edition\u2026 Nonetheless, I must confess that the origin of your\nprinciple, which is foreign to quantum theory, is still distressing to\nme, however much I recognize that through it a most important\nconnection between quantum th. and classical electrodynamics is\nrevealed. (Sommerfeld to Bohr, 11 November 1920; BCW 3, p. 690)\n\n\nSuman Seth (2008) has argued that Sommerfeld\u2019s dissatisfaction\nwith the correspondence principle stemmed not so much from a\ncommitment to formal rules as Darrigol suggests, but more from his\ngeneral distrust of analogical thinking and what he took to be an\nillegitimate mixing of quantum and classical concepts. We see this,\nfor example, in Sommerfeld\u2019s 1924 article on Bohr\u2019s atomic\nmodels, where he writes,\n\nThe magic of the correspondence principle has proved itself generally\nthrough the selection rules of the quantum numbers, in the series and\nband spectra\u2026 Nonetheless I cannot view it as ultimately\nsatisfying on account of its mixing of quantum-theoretical and\nclassical viewpoints. (Sommerfeld 1924, p. 1048; quoted also in Seth\n2008, p. 345).\n\n\nSommerfeld\u2019s critical attitude toward the correspondence\nprinciple would prove influential on Wolfgang Pauli and Werner\nHeisenberg, both of whom were his doctoral students.\n",
