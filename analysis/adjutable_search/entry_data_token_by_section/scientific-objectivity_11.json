    "main_text": "Objectivity as Freedom from Personal Biases || Statistical Evidence\n4.2 Statistical Evidence\n\nThe appraisal of scientific evidence is traditionally regarded as a\ndomain of scientific reasoning where the ideal of scientific\nobjectivity has strong normative force, and where it is also\nwell-entrenched in scientific practice. Episodes such as\nGalilei\u2019s observations of the Jupiter moons, Lavoisier\u2019s\ncalcination experiments, and Eddington\u2019s observation of the 1919\neclipse are found in all philosophy of science textbooks because they\nexemplify how evidence can be persuasive and compelling to scientists\nwith different backgrounds. The crucial question is therefore: can we\nidentify an \u201cobjective\u201d concept of scientific evidence\nthat is independent of the personal biases of the experimenter and\ninterpreter?\n\nInferential statistics\u2014the field that investigates the validity\nof inferences from data to theory\u2014tries to answer this question.\nIt is extremely influential in modern science, pervading experimental\nresearch as well as the assessment and acceptance of our most\nfundamental theories. For instance, a statistical argument helped to\nestablish the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson. We now compare the\nmain theories of statistical evidence with respect to the objectivity\nof the claims they produce. They mainly differ with respect to the\nrole of an explicitly subjective interpretation of probability.\n4.2.1 Bayesian Inference\n\nBayesian inference quantifies scientific evidence by means of\nprobabilities that are interpreted as a scientist\u2019s subjective\ndegrees of belief. The Bayesian thus leaves behind Carnap\u2019s\n(1950) idea that probability is determined by a logical relation\nbetween sentences. For example, the prior degree of belief in\nhypothesis \\(H\\), written \\(p(H)\\), can in principle take any value in\nthe interval \\([0,1]\\). Simultaneously held degrees of belief in\ndifferent hypotheses are, however, constrained by the laws of\nprobability. After learning evidence E, the degree of belief in \\(H\\)\nis changed from its prior probability \\(p(H)\\) to the conditional\ndegree of belief \\(p(H \\mid E)\\), commonly called the posterior\nprobability of \\(H\\). Both quantities can be related to each other by\nmeans of\n Bayes\u2019 Theorem.\n\nThese days, the Bayesian approach is extremely influential in\nphilosophy and rapidly gaining ground across all scientific\ndisciplines. For quantifying evidence for a hypothesis, Bayesian\nstatisticians almost uniformly use the Bayes factor,\nthat is, the ratio of prior to posterior odds in favor of a\nhypothesis. The Bayes factor in favor of hypothesis \\(H\\) against its\nnegation \\(\\neg\\)\\(H\\) in the light of evidence \\(E\\) can be written\nas \n\n\\[\\tag{3}\\label{eqn:BF} BF (E) := \\frac{p(H \\mid E)}{p(\\neg H \\mid E)} \\cdot \\frac{p(\\neg H)}{p(H)} = \\frac{p(E \\mid H)}{p(E \\mid \\neg H)},\\]\n\n\nor in other words, as the likelihood ratio between \\(H\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\)\\(H\\). The Bayes factor reduces to the likelihoodist\nconception of evidence (Royall 1997) for the case of two competing\npoint hypotheses. For further discussion of Bayesian measures of\nevidence, see Good (1950), Sprenger and Hartmann (2019: ch. 1) and the\nentry on\n confirmation and evidential support.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the idea to measure scientific evidence in terms of\nsubjective probability has met resistance. For example, the\nstatistician Ronald A. Fisher (1935: 6\u20137) has argued that\nmeasuring psychological tendencies cannot be relevant for scientific\ninquiry and sustain claims to objectivity. Indeed, how should\nscientific objectivity square with subjective degree of belief?\nBayesians have responded to this challenge in various ways:\n\n\n\nHowson (2000) and Howson and Urbach (2006) consider the objection\nmisplaced. In the same way that deductive logic does not judge the\ncorrectness of the premises but just advises you what to infer from\nthem, Bayesian inductive logic provides rational\nrules for representing uncertainty and making inductive inferences.\nChoosing the premises (e.g., the prior distributions)\n\u201cobjectively\u201d falls outside the scope of Bayesian\nanalysis. \n\n\nConvergence or merging-of-opinion theorems guarantee\nthat under certain circumstances, agents with very different initial\nattitudes who observe the same evidence will obtain similar posterior\ndegrees of belief in the long run. However, they are asymptotic\nresults without direct implications for inference with real-life\ndatasets (see also Earman 1992: ch. 6). In such cases, the choice of\nthe prior matters, and it may be beset with idiosyncratic bias and\nmanifest social values. \n\n\nAdopting a more modest stance, Sprenger (2018) accepts that Bayesian\ninference does not achieve the goal of objectivity in the sense of\nintersubjective agreement (concordant objectivity), or being free of\npersonal values, bias and subjective judgment. However, he argues that\ncompeting schools of inference such as frequentist inference face this\nproblem to the same degree, perhaps even worse. Moreover, some\nfeatures of Bayesian inference (e.g., the transparency about prior\nassumptions) fit recent, socially oriented conceptions of objectivity\nthat we discuss in\n section 5.\n\n\n\nA radical Bayesian solution to the problem of personal bias is to\nadopt a principle that radically constrains an agent\u2019s rational\ndegrees of belief, such as the Principle of Maximum\nEntropy (MaxEnt\u2014Jaynes 1968; Williamson 2010).\nAccording to MaxEnt, degrees of belief must be probabilistic and in\nsync with empirical constraints, but conditional on these constraints,\nthey must be equivocal, that is, as middling as possible. This latter\nconstraint amounts to maximizing the entropy of the probability\ndistribution in question. The MaxEnt approach eliminates various\nsources of subjective bias at the expense of narrowing down the range\nof rational degrees of belief. An alternative objective Bayesian\nsolution consists in so-called \u201cobjective\npriors\u201d: prior probabilities that do not represent an\nagent\u2019s factual attitudes, but are determined by principles of\nsymmetry, mathematical convenience or maximizing the influence of the\ndata on the posterior (e.g., Jeffreys 1939 [1980]; Bernardo 2012).\n\nThus, Bayesian inference, which analyzes statistical evidence from the\nvantage point of rational belief, provides only a partial answer to\nsecuring scientific objectivity from personal idiosyncrasy.\n4.2.2 Frequentist Inference\n\nThe frequentist conception of evidence is based on the idea of the\nstatistical test of a hypothesis. Under the influence\nof the statisticians Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, tests were often\nregarded as rational decision procedures that minimize the relative\nfrequency of wrong decisions in a hypothetical series of repetitions\nof a test (hence the name \u201cfrequentism\u201d). Rudner\u2019s\nargument in\n section 3.2\n has pointed out the limits of this conception of hypothesis tests:\nthe choice of thresholds for acceptance and rejection (i.e., the\nacceptable type I and II error rates) may reflect contextual value\njudgments and personal bias. Moreover, the losses associated with\nerroneously accepting or rejecting that hypothesis depend on the\ncontext of application which may be unbeknownst to the\nexperimenter.\n\nAlternatively, scientists can restrict themselves to a purely\nevidential interpretation of hypothesis tests and leave decisions to\npolicy-makers and regulatory agencies. The statistician and biologist\nR.A. Fisher (1935, 1956) proposed what later became the orthodox\nquantification of evidence in frequentist statistics. Suppose a\n\u201cnull\u201d or default hypothesis \\(H_0\\) denotes that an\nintervention has zero effect. If the observed data are\n\u201cextreme\u201d under \\(H_0\\)\u2014i.e., if it was highly\nlikely to observe a result that agrees better with \\(H_0\\)\u2014the\ndata provide evidence against the null hypothesis and for the efficacy\nof the intervention. The epistemological rationale is connected to the\nidea of severe testing (Mayo 1996): if the intervention were\nineffective, we would, in all likelihood, have found data that agree\nbetter with the null hypothesis. The strength of evidence against\n\\(H_0\\) is equal to the \\(p\\)-value: the lower it is,\nthe stronger evidence \\(E\\) speaks against the null hypothesis\n\\(H_0\\).\n\nUnlike Bayes factors, this concept of statistical evidence does not\ndepend on personal degrees of belief. However, this does not\nnecessarily mean that \\(p\\)-values are more objective. First,\n\\(p\\)-values are usually classified as \u201cnon-significant\u201d\n(\\(p > .05\\)), \u201csignificant\u201d (\\(p < .05\\)),\n\u201chighly significant\u201d, and so on. Not only that these\nthresholds and labels are largely arbitrary, they also promote\npublication bias: non-significant findings are often\nclassified as \u201cfailed studies\u201d (i.e., the efficacy of the\nintervention could not be shown), rarely published and end up in the\nproverbial \u201cfile drawer\u201d. Much valuable research is\nsuppressed. Conversely, significant findings may often occur when the\nnull hypothesis is actually true, especially when researchers have\nbeen \u201chunting for significance\u201d. In fact, researchers have\nan incentive to keep their \\(p\\)-values low: the stronger the\nevidence, the more convincing the narrative, the greater the\nimpact\u2014and the higher the chance for a good publication and\ncareer-relevant rewards. Moving the goalpost by\n\u201cp-hacking\u201d outcomes\u2014for example by eliminating\noutliers, selective reporting or restricting the analysis to a\nsubgroup\u2014evidently biases the research results and compromises\nthe objectivity of experimental research.\n\nIn particular, such questionable research practices\n(QRP) increase the type I error rate, which measures the rate\nat which false hypotheses are accepted, substantially over its nominal\n5% level and contribute to publication bias (Bakker et al. 2012).\nIoannidis (2005) concludes that \u201cmost published research\nfindings are false\u201d\u2014they are the combined result of a low\nbase rate of effective causal interventions, the file drawer effect\nand the widespread presence of questionable research practices. The\nfrequentist logic of hypothesis testing aggravates the problem because\nit provides a framework where all these biases can easily enter\n(Ziliak and McCloskey 2008; Sprenger 2016). These radical conclusions\nare also confirmed by empirical findings: in many disciplines\nresearchers fail to replicate findings by other scientific teams. See\n section 5.1\n for more detail.\n\nSumming up our findings, neither of the two major frameworks of\nstatistical inference manages to eliminate all sources of personal\nbias and idiosyncrasy. The Bayesian considers subjective assumptions\nto be an irreducible part of scientific reasoning and sees no harm in\nmaking them explicit. The frequentist conception of evidence based on\n\\(p\\)-values avoids these explicitly subjective elements, but at the\nprice of a misleading impression of objectivity and frequent abuse in\npractice. A defense of frequentist inference should, in our opinion,\nstress that the relatively rigid rules for interpreting statistical\nevidence facilitate communication and assessment of research results\nin the scientific community\u2014something that is harder to achieve\nfor a Bayesian. We now turn from specific methods for stating and\ninterpreting evidence to a radical criticism of the idea that there is\na rational scientific method.\n4.3 Feyerabend: The Tyranny of the Rational Method\n\nIn his writings of the 1970s,\n Paul Feyerabend\n launched a profound attack on the rationality and objectivity of\nscientific method. His position is exceptional in the philosophical\nliterature since traditionally, the threat for objective and\nsuccessful science is located in contextual rather than epistemic\nvalues. Feyerabend turns this view upside down: it is the\n\u201ctyranny\u201d of rational method, and the emphasis on\nepistemic rather than contextual values that prevents us from having a\nscience in the service of society. Moreover, he welcomes a diversity\nof different personal, also idiosyncratic perspectives, thus denying\nthe idea that freedom from personal \u201cbias\u201d is\nepistemically and socially beneficial.\n\nThe starting point of Feyerabend\u2019s criticism of rational method\nis the thesis that strict epistemic rules such as those expressed by\nthe VFI only suppress an open exchange of ideas, extinguish scientific\ncreativity and prevent a free and truly democratic science. In his\nclassic \u201cAgainst Method\u201d (1975: chs. 8\u201313),\nFeyerabend elaborates on this criticism by examining a famous episode\nin the history of science. When the Catholic Church objected to\nGalilean mechanics, it had the better arguments by the standards of\nseventeenth-century science. Their conservatism in their position was\nscientifically backed: Galilei\u2019s telescopes were unreliable for\ncelestial observations, and many well-established phenomena (no fixed\nstar parallax, invariance of laws of motion) could not yet be\nexplained in the heliocentric system. With hindsight, Galilei managed\nto achieve groundbreaking scientific progress just because he\ndeliberately violated rules of scientific reasoning. Hence\nFeyerabend\u2019s dictum \u201cAnything goes\u201d: no methodology\nwhatsoever is able to capture the creative and often irrational ways\nby which science deepens our understanding of the world. Good\nscientific reasoning cannot be captured by rational method, as Carnap,\nHempel and Popper postulated.\n\nThe drawbacks of an objective, value-free and method-bound view on\nscience and scientific method are not only epistemic. Such a view\nnarrows down our perspective and makes us less free, open-minded,\ncreative, and ultimately, less human in our thinking (Feyerabend 1975:\n154). It is therefore neither possible nor desirable to have an\nobjective, value-free science (cf. Feyerabend 1978: 78\u201379). As a\nconsequence, Feyerabend sees traditional forms of inquiry about our\nworld (e.g., Chinese medicine) on a par with their Western\ncompetitors. He denounces appeals to \u201cobjective\u201d standards\nas rhetorical tools for bolstering the epistemic authority of a small\nintellectual elite (=Western scientists), and as barely disguised\nstatements of preference for one\u2019s own worldview:\n\n\nthere is hardly any difference between the members of a\n\u201cprimitive\u201d tribe who defend their laws because they are\nthe laws of the gods [\u2026] and a rationalist who appeals to\n\u201cobjective\u201d standards, except that the former know what\nthey are doing while the latter does not. (1978: 82)\n\n\nIn particular, when discussing other traditions, we often project our\nown worldview and value judgments into them instead of making an\nimpartial comparison (1978: 80\u201383). There is no purely rational\njustification for dismissing other perspectives in favor of the\nWestern scientific worldview\u2014the insistence on our Western\napproach may be as justified as insisting on absolute space and time\nafter the Theory of Relativity.\n\nThe Galilei example also illustrates that personal perspective and\nidiosyncratic \u201cbias\u201d need not be bad for science.\nFeyerabend argues further that scientific research is accountable to\nsociety and should be kept in check by democratic institutions, and\nlaymen in particular. Their particular perspectives can help to\ndetermine the funding agenda and to set ethical standards for\nscientific inquiry, but also be useful for traditionally value-free\ntasks such as choosing an appropriate research method and assessing\nscientific evidence. Feyerabend\u2019s writings on this issue were\nmuch influenced by witnessing the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S.\nand the increasing emancipation of minorities, such as Blacks, Asians\nand Hispanics.\n\nAll this is not meant to say that truth loses its function as a\nnormative concept, nor that all scientific claims are equally\nacceptable. Rather, Feyerabend advocates an epistemic\npluralism that accepts diverse approaches to acquiring\nknowledge. Rather than defending a narrow and misleading ideal of\nobjectivity, science should respect the diversity of values and\ntraditions that drive our inquiries about the world (1978:\n106\u2013107). This would put science back into the role it had\nduring the scientific revolution or the Enlightenment: as a liberating\nforce that fought intellectual and political oppression by the\nsovereign, the nobility or the clergy. Objections to this view are\ndiscussed at the end of\n section 5.2.\n5. Objectivity as a Feature of Scientific Communities and Their Practices\n\nThis section addresses various accounts that regard scientific\nobjectivity essentially as a function of social practices in science\nand the social organization of the scientific community. All these\naccounts reject the characterization of scientific objectivity as a\nfunction of correspondence between theories and the world, as a\nfeature of individual reasoning practices, or as pertaining to\nindividual studies and experiments (see also Douglas 2011). Instead,\nthey evaluate the objectivity of a collective of studies, as\nwell as the methods and community practices that structure and guide\nscientific research. More precisely, they adopt a meta-analytic\nperspective for assessing the reliability of scientific results\n(section 5.1), and they construct objectivity from a feminist\nperspective: as an open interchange of mutual criticism, or as being\nanchored in the \u201csituatedness\u201d of our scientific practices\nand the knowledge we gain\n (section 5.2).\n5.1 Reproducibility and the Meta-Analytic Perspective\n\nThe collectivist perspective is especially useful when an entire\ndiscipline enters a stage of crisis: its members become convinced that\na significant proportion of findings are not trustworthy. A\ncontemporary example of such a situation is the replication\ncrisis, which was briefly mentioned in the previous section\nand concerns the reproducibility of scientific knowledge\nclaims in a variety of different fields (most prominently: psychology,\nbiology, medicine). Large-scale replication projects have noticed that\nmany findings which we considered as an integral part of scientific\nknowledge failed to replicate in settings that were designed to mimic\nthe original experiment as closely as possible (e.g., Open Science\nCollaboration 2015). Successful attempts at replicating an\nexperimental result have long been argued to provide evidence of\nfreedom from particular kinds of artefacts and thus the\ntrustworthiness of the result. Compare the\n entry on experiment in physics.\n Likewise, failure to replicate indicates that either the original\nfinding, the result of the replication attempt, or both, are\nbiased\u2014though see John Norton\u2019s (ms., ch. 3\u2014see\nOther Internet Resources) arguments that the evidential value of\n(failed) replications crucially depends on researchers\u2019 material\nbackground assumptions.\n\nWhen replication failures in a discipline are particularly\nsignificant, one may conclude that the published literature lacks\nobjectivity\u2014at a minimum the discipline fails to inspire trust\nthat its findings are more than artefacts of the researchers\u2019\nefforts. Conversely, when observed effects can be replicated in\nfollow-up experiments, a kind of objectivity is reached that goes\nbeyond the ideas of freedom from personal bias, mechanical\nobjectivity, and subject-independent measurement, discussed in\n section 4.1.\n\nFreese and Peterson (2018) call this idea statistical\nobjectivity. It grounds in the view that even the most\nscrupulous and diligent researchers cannot achieve full objectivity\nall by themselves. The term \u201cobjectivity\u201d instead applies\nto a collection or population of studies, with\nmeta-analysis (a formal method for aggregating the\nresults from ranges of studies) as the \u201capex of\nobjectivity\u201d (Freese and Peterson 2018, 304; see also Stegenga\n2011, 2018). In particular, aggregating studies from different\nresearchers may provide evidence of systematic bias and questionable\nresearch practices (QRP) in the published literature. This diagnostic\nfunction of meta-analysis for detecting violations of objectivity is\nenhanced by statistical techniques such as the funnel plot and the\n\\(p\\)-curve (Simonsohn et al. 2014).\n\nApart from this epistemic dimension, research on statistical\nobjectivity also has an activist dimension: methodologists urge\nresearchers to make publicly available essential parts of their\nresearch before the data analysis starts, and to make their methods\nand data sources more transparent. For example, it is conjectured that\nthe replicability (and thus objectivity) of science will increase by\nmaking all data available online, by preregistering experiments, and\nby using the registered reports model for journal articles (i.e., the\njournal decides on publication before data collection on the basis of\nthe significance of the proposed research as well as the experimental\ndesign). The idea is that transparency about the data set and the\nexperimental design will make it easier to stage a replication of an\nexperiment and to assess its methodological quality. Moreover,\npublicly committing to a data analysis plan beforehand will lower the\nrate of QRPs and of attempts to accommodate data to\nhypotheses rather than making proper predictions.\n\nAll in all, statistical objectivity moves the discussion of\nobjectivity to the level of population of studies. There, it takes up\nand modifies several conceptions of objectivity that we have seen\nbefore: most prominently, freedom of subjective bias, which is\nreplaced with collective bias and pernicious conventions, and the\nsubject-independent measurement of a physical quantity, which is\nreplaced by reproducibility of effects.\n5.2 Feminist and Standpoint Epistemology\n\nTraditional notions of objectivity as faithfulness to facts or freedom\nof contextual values have also been challenged from a feminist\nperspective. These critiques can be grouped in three major research\nprograms: feminist epistemology, feminist standpoint theory and\nfeminist postmodernism (Crasnow 2013). The program of feminist\nepistemology explores the impact of sex and gender on the\nproduction of scientific knowledge. More precisely, feminist\nepistemology highlights the epistemic risks resulting from the\nsystematic exclusion of women from the ranks of scientists, and the\nneglect of women as objects of study. Prominent case studies are the\nneglect of female orgasm in biology, testing medical drugs on male\nparticipants only, focusing on male specimen when studying the social\nbehavior of primates, and explaining human mating patterns by means of\nimaginary neolithic societies (e.g., Hrdy 1977; Lloyd 1993, 2005). See\nalso the\n entry on feminist philosophy of biology.\n\nOften but not always, feminist epistemologists go beyond pointing out\nwhat they regard as androcentric bias and reject the value-free ideal\naltogether\u2014with an eye on the social and moral responsibility of\nscientific inquiry. They try to show that a value-laden science can\nalso meet important criteria for being epistemically reliable and\nobjective (e.g., Anderson 2004; Kourany 2010). A classical\nrepresentative of such efforts is Longino\u2019s (1990)\ncontextual empiricism. She reinforces Popper\u2019s\ninsistence that \u201cthe objectivity of scientific statements lies\nin the fact that they can be inter-subjectively tested\u201d (1934\n[2002]: 22), but unlike Popper, she conceives scientific knowledge\nessentially as a social product. Thus, our conception of scientific\nobjectivity must directly engage with the social process that\ngenerates knowledge. Longino assigns a crucial function to social\nsystems of criticism in securing the epistemic success of science.\nSpecifically, she develops an epistemology which regards a method of\ninquiry as \u201cobjective to the degree that it permits\ntransformative criticism\u201d (Longino 1990: 76).\nFor an epistemic community to achieve transformative criticism, there\nmust be:\n\n\n\navenues for criticism: criticism is an essential part\nof scientific institutions (e.g., peer review); \n\n\nshared standards: the community must share a set of\ncognitive values for assessing theories (more on this in\n section 3.1);\n\n\n\nuptake of criticism: criticism must be able to\ntransform scientific practice in the long run; \n\n\nequality of intellectual authority: intellectual\nauthority must be shared equally among qualified practitioners.\n\n\n\nLongino\u2019s contextual empiricism can be understood as a\ndevelopment of John Stuart Mill\u2019s view that beliefs should never\nbe suppressed, independently of whether they are true or false. Even\nthe most implausible beliefs might be true, and even if they are\nfalse, they might contain a grain of truth which is worth preserving\nor helps to better articulate true beliefs (Mill 1859 [2003: 72]). The\nunderlying intuition is supported by recent empirical research on the\nepistemic benefits of a diversity of opinions and perspectives (Page\n2007). By stressing the social nature of scientific knowledge, and the\nimportance of criticism (e.g., with respect to potential androcentric\nbias and inclusive practice), Longino\u2019s account fits into the\nbroader project of feminist epistemology.\n\nStandpoint theory undertakes a more radical attack on\ntraditional scientific objectivity. This view develops Marxist ideas\nto the effect that epistemic position is related to, and a product of,\nsocial position. Feminist standpoint theory builds on these ideas but\nfocuses on gender, racial and other social relations. Feminist\nstandpoint theorists and proponents of \u201csituated\nknowledge\u201d such as Donna Haraway (1988), Sandra Harding\n(1991, 2015a, 2015b) and Alison Wylie (2003) deny the internal\ncoherence of a view from nowhere: all human knowledge is at base\nhuman knowledge and therefore necessarily perspectival. But\nthey argue more than that. Not only is perspectivality the human\ncondition, it is also a good thing to have. This is because\nperspectives, especially the perspectives of underprivileged classes\nand groups in society, come along with epistemic benefits. These ideas\nare controversial but they draw attention to the possibility that\nattempts to rid science of perspectives might not only be futile but\nalso costly: they prevent scientists from having the epistemic\nbenefits certain standpoints afford and from developing knowledge\nfor marginalized groups in society. The perspectival stance\ncan also explain why criteria for objectivity often vary with context:\nthe relative importance of epistemic virtues is a matter of goals and\ninterests\u2014in other words, standpoint.\n\nBy endorsing a perspectival stance, feminist standpoint theory rejects\nclassical elements of scientific objectivity such as neutrality and\nimpartiality (see\n section 3.1\n above). This is a notable difference to feminist epistemology, which\nis in principle (though not always in practice) compatible with\ntraditional views of objectivity. Feminist standpoint theory is also a\npolitical project. For example, Harding (1991, 1993) demands that\nscientists, their communities and their practices\u2014in other\nwords, the ways through which knowledge is gained\u2014be\ninvestigated as rigorously as the object of knowledge itself. This\nidea she refers to as \u201cstrong\nobjectivity\u201d replaces the \u201cweak\u201d conception\nof objectivity in the empiricist tradition: value-freedom,\nimpartiality, rigorous adherence to methods of testing and inference.\nLike Feyerabend, Harding integrates a transformation of epistemic\nstandards in science into a broader political project of rendering\nscience more democratic and inclusive. On the other hand, she is\nexposed to similar objections (see also Haack 2003). Isn\u2019t it\ngrossly exaggerated to identify class, race and gender as important\nfactors in the construction of physical theories? Doesn\u2019t the\nfeminist approach\u2014like social constructivist\napproaches\u2014lose sight of the particular epistemic qualities of\nscience? Should non-scientists really have as much authority as\ntrained scientists? To whom does the condition of equally shared\nintellectual authority apply? Nor is it clear\u2014especially in\ntimes of fake news and filter bubbles\u2014whether it is always a\ngood idea to subject scientific results to democratic approval. There\nis no guarantee (arguably there are few good reasons to believe) that\ndemocratized or standpoint-based science leads to more reliable\ntheories, or better decisions for society as a whole.\n6. Issues in the Special Sciences\n\nSo far everything we discussed was meant to apply across all or at\nleast most of the sciences. In this section we will look at a number\nof specific issues that arise in the social sciences, in economics,\nand in evidence-based medicine.\n6.1 Max Weber and Objectivity in the Social Sciences\n\nThere is a long tradition in the philosophy of social science\nmaintaining that there is a gulf in terms of both goals as well as\nmethods between the natural and the social sciences. This tradition,\nassociated with thinkers such as the neo-Kantians Heinrich Rickert and\nWilhelm Windelband, the hermeneuticist Wilhelm Dilthey, the\nsociologist-economist Max Weber, and the twentieth-century\nhermeneuticists Hans-Georg Gadamer and Michael Oakeshott, holds that\nunlike the natural sciences whose aim it is to establish natural laws\nand which proceed by experimentation and causal analysis, the social\nsciences seek understanding (\u201cVerstehen\u201d) of\nsocial phenomena, the interpretive examination of the meanings\nindividuals attribute to their actions (Weber 1904 [1949]; Weber 1917\n[1949]; Dilthey 1910 [1986]; Windelband 1915; Rickert 1929; Oakeshott\n1933; Gadamer 1960 [1989]). See also the entries on\n hermeneutics\n and\n Max Weber.\n\nUnderstood this way, social science lacks objectivity in more than one\nsense. One of the more important debates concerning objectivity in the\nsocial sciences concerns the role value judgments play and,\nimportantly, whether value-laden research entails claims about the\ndesirability of actions. Max Weber held that the social sciences are\nnecessarily value laden. However, they can achieve some degree of\nobjectivity by keeping out the social researcher\u2019s views about\nwhether agents\u2019 goals are commendable. In a similar vein,\ncontemporary economics can be said to be value laden because it\npredicts and explains social phenomena on the basis of agents\u2019\npreferences. Nevertheless, economists are adamant that economists are\nnot in the business of telling people what they ought to value. Modern\neconomics is thus said to be objective in the Weberian sense of\n\u201cabsence of researchers\u2019\nvalues\u201d\u2014a conception that we discussed in detail\nin\n section 3.\n\nIn his widely cited essay \u201c\u2018Objectivity\u2019 in Social\nScience and Social Policy\u201d (Weber 1904 [1949]), Weber argued\nthat the idea of an aperspectival social science was meaningless:\n\n\nThere is no absolutely objective scientific analysis of [\u2026]\n\u201csocial phenomena\u201d independent of special and\n\u201cone-sided\u201d viewpoints according to which expressly or\ntacitly, consciously or unconsciously they are selected, analyzed and\norganized for expository purposes. (1904 [1949: 72])\n\nAll knowledge of cultural reality, as may be seen, is always knowledge\nfrom particular points of view. (1904 [1949:. 81])\n\n\nThe reason for this is twofold. First, social reality is too complex\nto admit of full description and explanation. So we have to select.\nBut, perhaps in contraposition to the natural sciences, we cannot just\nselect those aspects of the phenomena that fall under universal\nnatural laws and treat everything else as \u201cunintegrated\nresidues\u201d (1904 [1949: 73]). This is because, second, in the\nsocial sciences we want to understand social phenomena in their\nindividuality, that is, in their unique configurations that have\nsignificance for us.\n\nValues solve a selection problem. They tell us what research questions\nwe ought to address because they inform us about the cultural\nimportance of social phenomena:\n\n\nOnly a small portion of existing concrete reality is colored by our\nvalue-conditioned interest and it alone is significant to us. It is\nsignificant because it reveals relationships which are important to\nuse due to their connection with our values. (1904 [1949: 76])\n\n\nIt is important to note that Weber did not think that social and\nnatural science were different in kind, as Dilthey and others did.\nSocial science too examines the causes of phenomena of interest, and\nnatural science too often seeks to explain natural phenomena in their\nindividual constellations. The role of causal laws is different in the\ntwo fields, however. Whereas establishing a causal law is often an end\nin itself in the natural sciences, in the social sciences laws play an\nattenuated and accompanying role as mere means to explain cultural\nphenomena in their uniqueness.\n\nNevertheless, for Weber social science remains objective in at least\ntwo ways. First, once research questions of interest have been\nsettled, answers about the causes of culturally significant phenomena\ndo not depend on the idiosyncrasies of an individual researcher:\n\n\nBut it obviously does not follow from this that research in the\ncultural sciences can only have results which are\n\u201csubjective\u201d in the sense that they are valid for one\nperson and not for others. [\u2026] For scientific truth is\nprecisely what is valid for all who seek the truth. (Weber 1904 [1949:\n84], emphasis original)\n\n\nThe claims of social science can therefore be objective in our third\nsense\n (see section 4).\n Moreover, by determining that a given phenomenon is \u201cculturally\nsignificant\u201d a researcher reflects on whether or not a practice\nis \u201cmeaningful\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d, and not\nwhether or not it is commendable: \u201cProstitution is a cultural\nphenomenon just as much as religion or money\u201d (1904 [1949: 81]).\nAn important implication of this view came to the fore in the\nso-called \u201cWerturteilsstreit\u201d (quarrel concerning\nvalue judgments) of the early 1900s. In this debate, Weber maintained\nagainst the \u201csocialists of the lectern\u201d around Gustav\nSchmoller the position that social scientists qua scientists should\nnot be directly involved in policy debates because it was not the aim\nof science to examine the appropriateness of ends. Given a policy\ngoal, a social scientist could make recommendations about effective\nstrategies to reach the goal; but social science was to be value-free\nin the sense of not taking a stance on the desirability of the goals\nthemselves. This leads us to our conception of objectivity as freedom\nfrom value judgments.\n6.2 Contemporary Rational Choice Theory\n\nContemporary mainstream economists hold a view concerning objectivity\nthat mirrors Max Weber\u2019s (see above). On the one hand, it is\nclear that value judgments are at the heart of economic theorizing.\n\u201cPreferences\u201d are a key concept of rational choice theory,\nthe main theory in contemporary mainstream economics. Preferences are\nevaluations. If an individual prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), she\nvalues \\(A\\) higher than \\(B\\) (Hausman 2012). Thus, to the\nextent that economists predict and explain market behavior in terms of\nrational choice theory, they predict and explain market behavior in a\nway laden with value judgments.\n\nHowever, economists are not themselves supposed to take a stance about\nwhether or not whatever individuals value is also\n\u201cobjectively\u201d good in a stronger sense:\n\n\n[\u2026] that an agent is rational from [rational choice\ntheory]\u2019s point of view does not mean that the course of action\nshe will choose is objectively optimal. Desires do not have to align\nwith any objective measure of \u201cgoodness\u201d: I may want to\nrisk swimming in a crocodile-infested lake; I may desire to smoke or\ndrink even though I know it harms me. Optimality is determined by the\nagent\u2019s desires, not the converse. (Paternotte 2011:\n307\u20138)\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Gul and Pesendorfer write:\n\n\nHowever, standard economics has no therapeutic ambition, i.e., it does\nnot try to evaluate or improve the individual\u2019s objectives.\nEconomics cannot distinguish between choices that maximize happiness,\nchoices that reflect a sense of duty, or choices that are the response\nto some impulse. Moreover, standard economics takes no position on the\nquestion of which of those objectives the agent should pursue. (Gul\nand Pesendorfer 2008: 8)\n\n\nAccording to the standard view, all that rational choice theory\ndemands is that people\u2019s preferences are (internally)\nconsistent; it has no business in telling people what they ought to\nprefer, whether their preferences are consistent with external norms\nor values. Economics is thus value-laden, but laden with the values of\nthe agents whose behavior it seeks to predict and explain and not with\nthe values of those who seek to predict and explain this behavior.\n\nWhether or not social science, and economics in particular, can be\nobjective in this\u2014Weber\u2019s and the contemporary\neconomists\u2019\u2014sense is controversial. On the one hand, there\nare some reasons to believe that rational choice theory (which is at\nwork not only in economics but also in political science and other\nsocial sciences) cannot be applied to empirical phenomena without\nreferring to external norms or values (Sen 1993; Reiss 2013).\n\nOn the other hand, it is not clear that economists and other social\nscientists qua social scientists shouldn\u2019t participate in a\ndebate about social goals. For one thing, trying to do welfare\nanalysis in the standard Weberian way tends to obscure rather than to\neliminate normative commitments (Putnam and Walsh 2007). Obscuring\nvalue judgments can be detrimental to the social scientist as policy\nadviser because it will hamper rather than promote trust in social\nscience. For another, economists are in a prime position to contribute\nto ethical debates, for a variety of reasons, and should therefore\ntake this responsibility seriously (Atkinson 2001).\n6.3 Evidence-based Medicine and Social Policy\n\nThe same demands calling for \u201cmechanical objectivity\u201d in\nthe natural sciences and quantification in the social and policy\nsciences in the nineteenth century and mid-twentieth century are\nresponsible for a recent movement in biomedical research, which, even\nmore recently, have swept to contemporary social science and policy.\nEarly proponents of so-called \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d\nmade their pursuit of a downplay of the \u201chuman element\u201d in\nmedicine plain:\n\n\nEvidence-based medicine de-emphasizes intuition, unsystematic clinical\nexperience, and pathophysiological rationale as sufficient grounds for\nclinical decision making and stresses the examination of evidence from\nclinical research. (Guyatt et al. 1992: 2420)\n\n\nTo call the new movement \u201cevidence-based\u201d is a misnomer\nstrictly speaking, as intuition, clinical experience and\npathophysiological rationale can certainly constitute evidence. But\nproponents of evidence-based practices have a much narrower concept of\nevidence in mind: analyses of the results of randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs). This movement is now very strong in biomedical\nresearch, development economics and a number of areas of social\nscience, especially psychology, education and social policy, and\nespecially in the English speaking world.\n\nThe goal is to replace subjective (biased, error-prone, idiosyncratic)\njudgments by mechanically objective methods. But, as in other areas,\nattempting to mechanize inquiry can lead to reduced accuracy and\nutility of the results.\n\nCausal relations in the social and biomedical sciences hold on account\nof highly complex arrangements of factors and conditions. Whether for\ninstance a substance is toxic depends on details of the metabolic\nsystem of the population ingesting it, and whether an educational\npolicy is effective on the constellation of factors that affect the\nstudents\u2019 learning progress. If an RCT was conducted\nsuccessfully, the conclusion about the effectiveness of the treatment\n(or toxicity of a substance) under test is certain for the particular\narrangement of factors and conditions of the trial (Cartwright 2007).\nBut unlike the RCT itself, many of whose aspects can be (relatively)\nmechanically implemented, applying the result to a new setting\n(recommending a treatment to a patient, for instance) always involves\nsubjective judgments of the kind proponents of evidence-based\npractices seek to avoid\u2014such as judgments about the similarity\nof the test to the target or policy population.\n\nOn the other hand, RCTs can be regarded as \u201cdebiasing\nprocedure\u201d because they prevent researchers from allocating\ntreatments to patients according to their personal interests, so that\nthe healthiest (or smartest or\u2026) subjects get the\nresearcher\u2019s favorite therapy. While unbalanced allocations can\ncertainly happen by chance, randomization still provides some warrant\nthat the allocation was not done on purpose with a view to\npromoting somebody\u2019s interests. A priori, the\nexperimental procedure is thus more impartial with respect to the\ninterests at stake. It has thus been argued that RCTs in medicine,\nwhile no guarantor of the best outcomes, were adopted by the U.S. Food\nand Drugs Administration (FDA) to different degrees during the 1960s\nand 1970s in order to regain public trust in its decisions about\ntreatments, which it had lost due to the thalidomide and other\nscandals (Teira and Reiss 2013; Teira 2010). It is important to\nnotice, however, that randomization is at best effective with respect\nto one kind of bias, viz. selection bias. Important other epistemic\nconcerns are not addressed by the procedure but should not be ignored\n(Worrall 2002).\n7. The Unity and Disunity of Scientific Objectivity\n\nIn sections 2\u20135, we have encountered various concepts of\nscientific objectivity and their limitations. This prompts the\nquestion of how unified (or disunified) scientific objectivity is as a\nconcept: Is there something substantive shared by all of these\nanalyses? Or is objectivity, as Heather Douglas (2004) puts it, an\n\u201cirreducibly complex\u201d concept?\n\nDouglas defends pluralism about scientific\nobjectivity and distinguishes three areas of application of\nthe concept: (1) interaction of humans with the world, (2) individual\nreasoning processes, (3) social processes in science. Within each\narea, there are various distinct senses which are again irreducible to\neach other and do not have a common core meaning. This does not mean\nthat the senses are unrelated; they share a complex web of\nrelationships and can also support each other\u2014for example,\neliminating values from reasoning may help to achieve procedural\nobjectivity. For Douglas, reducing objectivity to a single core\nmeaning would be a simplification without benefits; instead of a\ncomplex web of relations between different senses of objectivity we\nwould obtain an impoverished concept out of touch with scientific\npractice. Similar arguments and pluralist accounts can be found in\nMegill (1994), Janack (2002) and Padovani et al. (2015)\u2014see also\nAxtell (2016).\n\nIt has been argued, however, that pluralist approaches give up too\nquickly on the idea that the different senses of objectivity share one\nor several important common elements. As we have seen in section\n 4.1\n and\n 5.1,\n scientific objectivity and trust in science are\nclosely connected. Scientific objectivity is desirable because to the\nextent that science is objective we have reasons trust scientists,\ntheir results and recommendations (cf. Fine 1998: 18). Thus, perhaps\nwhat is unifying among the difference senses of objectivity is that\neach sense describes a feature of scientific practice that is able to\ninspire trust in science.\n\nBuilding on this idea, Inkeri Koskinen has recently argued that it is\nin fact not trust but reliance that we are after (Koskinen\nforthcoming). Trust is something that can be betrayed, but only\nindividuals can betray whereas objectivity pertains to institutions,\npractices, results, etc. We call scientific institutions, practices,\nresults, etc. objective to the extent that we have reasons to rely on\nthem. The analysis does not stop here, however. There is a distinct\nview about objectivity that is behind Daston and Galison\u2019s\nhistorical epistemology of the concept and has been defended by Ian\nHacking: that objectivity is not a\u2014positive\u2014virtue but\nrather the absence of this or that vice (Hacking 2015: 26). Speaking\nof objectivity in imaging, for instance, Daston and Galison write that\nthe goal is to\n\n\nlet the specimen appear without that distortion characteristic of the\nobserver\u2019s personal tastes, commitments, or ambitions. (Daston\nand Galison 2007: 121)\n\n\nKoskinen picks up this idea of objectivity as absence of\nvice and argues that it is specifically the aversion of\nepistemic risks for which the term is reserved. Epistemic\nrisks comprise \u201cany risk of epistemic error that arises anywhere\nduring knowledge practices\u2019 (Biddle and Kukla 2017: 218) such as\nthe risk of having mistaken beliefs, the risk of errors in reasoning\nand risks related to operationalization, concept formation, and model\nchoice. Koskinen argues that only those epistemic risks that relate to\nfailings of scientists as human beings are relevant to objectivity\n(Koskinen forthcoming: 13):\n\n\nFor instance, when the results of an experiment are incorrect because\nof malfunctioning equipment, we do not worry about\nobjectivity\u2014we just say that the results should not be taken\ninto account. [...] So it is only when the epistemic risk is related\nto our own failings, and is hard to avert, that we start talking about\nobjectivity. Illusions, subjectivity, idiosyncrasies, and collective\nbiases are important epistemic risks arising from our imperfections as\nepistemic agents.\n\n\nKoskinen understands her account as a response to Hacking\u2019s\n(2015) criticism that we should stop talking about objectivity\naltogether. According to Hacking, \u201cobjectivity\u201d is an\n\u201celevator\u201d or second-level word, similar to\n\u201ctrue\u201d or \u201creal\u201d\u2014\u201cInstead of\nsaying that the cat is on the mat, we move up one story and and say\nthat it is true that the cat is on the mat\u201d (2015: 20). He\nrecommends to stick to ground-level questions and worry about whether\nspecific sources of error have been controlled. (A similar elimination\nrequest with respect to the labels \u201cobjective\u201d and\n\u201csubjective\u201d in statistical inference has been advanced by\nGelman and Hennig (2017).) In focussing on averting specific epistemic\nrisks, Koskinen\u2019s account does precisely that. Koskinen argues\nthat a unified account of objectivity as averting epistemic risks\ntakes into account Hacking\u2019s negative stance and explains at the\nsame time important features of the concept\u2014for example, why\nobjectivity does not imply certainty and why it varies with\ncontext.\n\nThe strong point of this account is that none of the threats to a\npeculiar analysis puts scientific objectivity at risk. We can (and in\nfact, we do) rely on scientific practices that represent the world\nfrom a perspective and where non-epistemic values affect outcomes and\ndecisions. What is left open by Koskinen\u2019s account is the\nnormative question of what a scientist who cares about her experiments\nand inferences being objective should actually do. That is, the\nphilosophical ideas we have reviewed in this section stay mainly on\nthe descriptive level and do not give an actual guideline for working\nscientists. Connecting the abstract philosophical analysis to\nday-to-day work in science remains an open problem.\n8. Conclusions\n\nSo is scientific objectivity desirable? Is it attainable? That, as we\nhave seen, depends crucially on how the term is understood. We have\nlooked in detail at four different conceptions of scientific\nobjectivity: faithfulness to facts, value-freedom, freedom from\npersonal biases, and features of community practices. In each case,\nthere are at least some reasons to believe that either science cannot\ndeliver full objectivity in this sense, or that it would not be a good\nthing to try to do so, or both. Does this mean we should give up the\nidea of objectivity in science?\n\nWe have shown that it is hard to define scientific objectivity in\nterms of a view from nowhere, value freedom, or freedom from personal\nbias. It is a lot harder to say anything positive about the matter.\nPerhaps it is related to a thorough critical attitude concerning\nclaims and findings, as Popper thought. Perhaps it is the fact that\nmany voices are heard, equally respected and subjected to accepted\nstandards, as Longino defends. Perhaps it is something else\naltogether, or a combination of several factors discussed in this\narticle.\n\nHowever, one should not (as yet) throw out the baby with the\nbathwater. Like those who defend a particular explication of\nscientific objectivity, the critics struggle to explain what makes\nscience objective, trustworthy and special. For instance, our\ndiscussion of the value-free ideal (VFI) revealed that alternatives to\nthe VFI are as least as problematic as the VFI itself, and that the\nVFI may, with all its inadequacies, still be a useful heuristic for\nfostering scientific integrity and objectivity. Similarly, although\nentirely \u201cunbiased\u201d scientific procedures may be\nimpossible, there are many mechanisms scientists can adopt for\nprotecting their reasoning against undesirable forms of bias, e.g.,\nchoosing an appropriate method of statistical inference, being\ntransparent about different stages of the research process and\navoiding certain questionable research practices.\n\nWhatever it is, it should come as no surprise that finding a positive\ncharacterization of what makes science objective is hard. If we knew\nan answer, we would have done no less than solve the problem of\ninduction (because we would know what procedures or forms of\norganization are responsible for the success of science). Work on this\nproblem is an ongoing project, and so is the quest for understanding\nscientific objectivity.",
