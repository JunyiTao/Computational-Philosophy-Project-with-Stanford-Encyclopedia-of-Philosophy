    "main_text": "Challenges to moral responsibility\n1. Challenges to moral responsibility\n\nMoral responsibility is about human action and its intentions and\nconsequences (Fisher 1999, Eshleman 2016, Talbert 2022). Generally\nspeaking a person or a group of people is morally responsible when\ntheir voluntary actions have morally significant outcomes that would\nmake it appropriate to blame or praise them. Thus, we may consider it\na person\u2019s moral responsibility to jump in the water and try to\nrescue another person, when she sees that person drowning. If she\nmanages to pull the person from the water we are likely to praise her,\nwhereas if she refuses to help we may blame her. Ascribing moral\nresponsibility establishes a link between a person or a group of\npeople and someone or something affected by the actions of this person\nor group. The person or group that performs the action and causes\nsomething to happen is often referred to as the agent. The\nperson, group or thing that is affected by the action is referred to\nas the patient. Establishing a link in terms of moral\nresponsibility between the agent and the patient can be done both\nretrospectively as well as prospectively. That is, sometimes\nascriptions of responsibility involve giving an account of who was at\nfault for an accident and who should be punished. It can also be about\nprospectively determining the obligations and duties a person has to\nfulfill in the future and what she ought to do.\n\nHowever, the circumstances under which it is appropriate to ascribe\nmoral responsibility are not always clear. On the one hand the concept\nhas varying meanings and debates continue on what sets moral\nresponsibility apart from other kinds of responsibility (Hart 1968,\nTalbert 2022, Tigard 2021a). The concept is intertwined and sometimes\noverlaps with notions of accountability, liability, blameworthiness,\nrole-responsibility and causality. Opinions also differ on which\nconditions warrant the attribution of moral responsibility; whether it\nrequires an agent with free will or not and whether humans are the\nonly entities to which moral responsibility can be attributed (see the\nentry on\n moral responsibility).\n \n\nOn the other hand, it can be difficult to establish a direct link\nbetween the agent and the patient because of the complexity involved\nin human activity, in particular in today\u2019s technological\nsociety. Individuals and institutions generally act with and in\nsociotechnical systems in which tasks are distributed among\nhuman and technological components, which mutually affect each other\nin different ways depending on the context (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch\n1987, Felt et al. 2016). Increasingly complex technologies can\nexacerbate the difficulty of identifying who or what is\n\u2018responsible\u2019. When something goes wrong, a retrospective\naccount of what happened is expected and the more complex the system,\nthe more challenging is the task of ascribing responsibility (Johnson\nand Powers 2005). Indeed, Matthias argues that there is a growing\n\u2018responsibility gap\u2019: the more complex computer\ntechnologies become and the less human beings can directly control or\nintervene in the behavior of these technologies, the less we can\nreasonably hold human beings responsible for these technologies\n(Matthias, 2004).\n\nThe increasing pervasiveness of computer technologies poses various\nchallenges to figuring out what moral responsibility entails and how\nit should be properly ascribed. To explain how computing complicates\nthe ascription of responsibility we have to consider the conditions\nunder which it makes sense to hold someone responsible. Despite the\nongoing philosophical debates on the issue, most analysis of moral\nresponsibility share at least the following three conditions (Eshleman\n2016; Jonas 1984):\n\nThere should be a causal connection between the person and the\noutcome of actions. A person is usually only held responsible if they\nhad some control over the outcome of events.\nThe subject has to have knowledge of and be able to consider the\npossible consequences of her actions. We tend to excuse someone from\nblame if they could not have known that their actions would lead to a\nharmful event.\nThe subject has to be able to freely choose to act in certain way.\nThat is, it does not make sense to hold someone responsible for a\nharmful event if her actions were completely determined by outside\nforces.\n\n\nA closer look at these three conditions shows that computing can\ncomplicate the applicability of each of these conditions.\n",
