    "main_text": "John of Paris\n11. John of Paris\n\nJohn of Paris (d. 1306) reasserts the traditional distinction between\nownership and\n rulership.[59]\n The fact that a ruler adjudicates property disputes does not make him\nsupreme owner. A community (a state, or the Church, or particular\ncommunities) acquires property only from individuals, and the head of\nthe community is the administrator of the community\u2019s property,\nnot its owner. This is true also of the pope, who does not have\nunrestricted power over Church property, still less over the\nproperties of lay people\n (96\u2013105).[60]\n John\u2019s assumption that original appropriation is by\nindividuals, and his remark that individuals acquire property by\n\u201clabour and industry\u201d (86, 103), have led to suggestions\nthat he anticipated Locke\u2019s theory of property. However, John\nindicates that individuals acquire property under human law (148, 154,\n 225\u20136),[61]\n which is the view traditional among medieval theologians, following\nAugustine (see\n \u00a74.3).\n Property is acquired under human law, but it is acquired by\nindividuals, not directly by rulers.\n\nAs for rulership, John argues that the pope cannot be the supreme\ntemporal ruler because the spiritual and temporal powers should be\nheld by different persons. John gives the traditional reasons (see\n \u00a76),\n emphasizing the argument that the priest should be exclusively\ndevoted to spiritual affairs (117\u20138). The temporal power is not\nestablished by, or in any way caused by, the spiritual power. Both\ncome from God, but neither comes through the other. The spiritual is\nin some sense superior, but not as being the cause of the temporal\npower (93, 192). The basis of the distinction between the two powers\nis not subject matter or ends, but means. Each power is limited to its\nown appropriate means of action; the secular power uses natural means,\nthe Church uses supernatural means (142\u201361). This is very much\nlike Thomas Aquinas\u2019s picture of two powers leading mankind\ntoward the goals of human life in ordered hierarchy, one using natural\nmeans and the other supernatural. Thomas infers from the fact that the\nChurch is concerned with the highest end the conclusion that the pope\nought to direct the secular ruler (see above,\n \u00a79.1).\n John explicitly rejects this line of argument. Teaching is a\nspiritual function, but in a household the teacher does not direct the\nphysician. The physician exercises a higher art than the pharmacist,\nbut, though the physician guides the pharmacist, he cannot give\nauthoritative directions or dismiss the pharmacist. Such officials in\na great household do not direct one another, but are all under the\ndirection of the head of the family. Similarly both pope and prince\nderive their authority from God, who sets the limits of their power,\nand he has not subordinated one to the other (182, 184\u201393).\n",
