    "main_text": "A glance at present-day investigations || Foundational frameworks and paradoxes\n6.2 Foundational frameworks and paradoxes\n\nPhilosophical motivations are strongly influential in contemporary\nlogical investigation of paradoxes and hence it is natural to wonder\nwhat is surviving of the initial Fregean theory of concepts, as based\nupon an inconsistent principle of abstraction and the logicistic\noutlook. Well, the answer is that a non-trivial legacy is still alive:\nthis is especially clear from the Neo-Fregean approach based on\nHume\u2019s principle and variations thereof. Consistent subsystems\nof Frege\u2019s Grundgesetze have been isolated and are currently\nstudied: see Burgess 2005, also for a comprehensive reference list to\npreceding work by Boolos, Wright and Hale, Heck, Wehmeier, Ferreira,\nAntonelli and May (see the essays contained in Reck and Cook 2016, and\nalso the entry\n logicism and neologicism).\u00a0In\n addition, work in the Neo-Fregean tradition has shown that the\ninconsistency of the principle of extensional abstraction (Basic\nLaw\u00a0V) in Grundgesetze is only an instance of a more general\nresult on the inconsistency in second order logic (extended with a\nsymbol for a function f from concepts to objects) of any abstraction\nprinciples that satisfy a condition called \u201cpart-whole\u201d:\nif A is strictly\u00a0included in B then f(A)\u2260f(B) (see Mancosu and\nSiskind 2019).\n\nOn the other hand, once we set apart the ideological inspiration of\nlogicism, we might believe that the development of logic and set\ntheory in the 20th century has fully sterilized paradoxes, and that\ncontradictions in logical systems are phenomena of the years of\nfoundational crisis only. But this is not true: paradoxes have been\ndiscovered in logical systems related to computer science. For\ninstance, half a century ago, Girard showed that a constructive theory\nof types, due to Per Martin-L\u00f6f 1971, and based on the\nCurry-Howard correspondence, is inconsistent with the existence of a\ntype of all types; the contradiction follows by means of a\ntype-theoretic reconstruction of an argument related to the\nBurali-Forti antinomy and the Mirimanoff paradox of grounded sets.\nLater, Coquand 1986 proved that certain extensions of the calculus C\nof constructions are inconsistent. Very roughly, C is a higher order\nimpredicative type theory, extending Girard\u2019s system F, a\npowerful second-order typed lambda calculus with abstraction on types\nwhich is suitable for representing proofs of impredicative\nintuitionistic second-order logic. Coquand 1994 offered a new paradox\naffecting type theory, which refines Reynold\u2019s result that there\nis no classical set-theoretic model of polymorphism (read:\nGirard\u2019s system F, see the entries\n Type Theory,\n set theory: constructive and intuitionistic ZF). On the other side, a general type-free development of\nthe theory of constructions as a foundation for constructive\nprovability in logic and mathematics was originally proposed by\nKreisel and Goodman, but it turned out to be affected by an antinomy,\nwhich has been recently reconsidered by Dean and Kurokawa 2016.\n\nOn the borderline between foundational issues and applications in\ncomputer science, arguments with typical paradoxical flavor occur in\nthe investigation of Feferman\u2019s explicit mathematics\n(EM), a theory of (self-applicable) operations and non-extensional\nclassifications. For instance, the existence of a strong power type\nconstruction leads to inconsistency in the so-called \u201ctheories\nof types and names\u201d, a development of EM introduced by\nJ\u00e4ger 1997. Paradoxical arguments are also useful for assessing\nthe role of universes and refuting non-extensionality in EM,\nin presence of forms of uniform na\u00efve comprehension (see\nCantini and Minari 1999). Indeed, the role of uniformity is essential\nin previous investigations. Concerning na\u00efve comprehension, it is\nknown since the seventies (Malitz 1976) and the eighties (Weydert\n1988, Forti and Hinnion 1989) that there exist nice topological models\nof extensionality and non-uniform na\u00efve\ncomprehension restricted to generalized positivity\nconditions. This has led to the study of so-called\nhyperuniverses. Additional consistency/inconsistency results\nabout the relationship between extensionality and uniform vs.\nnon-uniform comprehension principles can be found, e.g., in Hinnion\nand Libert 2003, Libert and Esser 2005. In a similar direction, recent\ntheoretical proposals combine anew ideas from combinatory logic and\nlambda calculus with \u201cinductive\u201d reinterpretations of\nna\u00efve comprehension and unrestricted truth schema, along a path\nalready opened by Fitch in the late forties (see Scott 1975, Flagg and\nMyhill 1987, Aczel 1980, and Feferman 1984). Beginning with 1992,\nthere was an attempt, due to K. Grue, to resurrect Church\u2019s\nlambda calculus as a foundation of mathematics. Grue 2002 presents a\nvery strong extension of lambda calculus, the so-called map\ntheory, in which standard axiomatic set theory becomes\ninterpretable, and which can be used to shed light on the difference\nbetween Russell\u2019s and Burali-Forti\u2019s paradoxes.\n",
