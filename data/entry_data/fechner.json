    "main_text": "\n1. A Divided Soul\n\nGustav Theodor Fechner (1801\u20131887) is one of the most enigmatic\nthinkers of nineteenth century German philosophy. His intellectual\nsoul was fractured, torn into two deeply divided halves, each of which\nclaimed dominance over the other. His entire career was an attempt to\nunite these warring sides. But, despite his best efforts, he never\nsucceeded. \n\nWhat were these halves? On the one hand, Fechner had deep positivist\nproclivities, which made him advocate the strictest standards of\nobservation and measurement in science, and which led him to adopt\nearly versions of phenomenalism and verificationism in philosophy. On\nthe other hand, Fechner also had a desperate longing for metaphysics,\nfor a complete vision of the entire cosmos, which his piecemeal\nscientific work could never satisfy. The problem facing him was\ndaunting: How to be both a cautious and sober scientist and a daring\nand imaginative metaphysician?\n\nThese two sides of Fechner represent conflicting currents of his age.\nGrowing up in the early nineteenth century, Fechner was exposed to the\nrise of romanticism and the growth of the empirical sciences. He was\nan early student of romantic Naturphilosophie, the writings\nof Schelling, Oken and Steffans, which were Faustian attempts to grasp\nnature as a whole. But he was also a student of physics and physiology\nat the University of Leipzig, where his mentors, Alfred Volkmann and\nErnst Weber, were at the forefront of experimental work on the\npsychology of perception. Fechner learned early that the speculative\nmethods of Naturphilosophie were insufficient to yield\ncareful and substantive results in science; despite that, he never\nlost the longing for unity, the desire for a complete vision of\nthings, which is characteristic of Naturphilosophie.\n\nEach side of Fechner\u2019s personality bore its characteristic\nfruit. The product of his positivist side was his early scientific\nwork on the psychology of perception, and his massive two volume work\nElemente der Psychophysik (1860), which attempts to describe\nin precise laws the relationship between the psychic and physical.\nBecause it stressed the dependence of the mental on its physical\nexpression and embodiment, Fechner\u2019s philosophy of mind has been\ndescribed as a form of materialism. The product of his metaphysical\nside is his so-called \u201cpanpsychism\u201d, the the doctrine that\nthe cosmos is psychic, that it is an embodiment of the psychic (for a\nmore precise definition of this term,\n see below, section 4).\n Fechner put forward this doctrine in his two most famous works:\nNanna oder \u00fcber das Seelenleben der Pflanzen (1848a) and\nZend-Avesta oder \u00fcber die Dinge des Himmels und des\nJenseits (1851). \n\nFechner\u2019s effort to harmonize the two sides of his nature came\nwith his inductive metaphysics, i.e., the attempt to reach\ngeneral metaphysical conclusions on the basis of the methods and\nresults of the empirical sciences. Like other philosophers of his\ngeneration, viz., Lotze, Trendelenburg and Hartmann, Fechner rejected\nthe synthetic methods of the German idealists (Fichte, Schelling,\nHegel), who attempted to derive their conclusions by a priori\nmethods. In his view, metaphysics should follow, not lead the\nempirical sciences, which are autonomous and stand on their own\nfoundation independent of philosophy. The crucial question was whether\ngeneral metaphysical principles really could be based on the empirical\nsciences, whose results are always piecemeal and tentative. \n\nAny attempt to understand Fechner must come to terms with both sides\nof his personality. We must do justice to his panpsychism as well as\nhis positivism. We can dismiss the panpsychism on positivist grounds,\nas many have done; but if we do that, we beg questions against\nFechner. He insisted that his conclusions are based on well-grounded\ninferences from facts of experience, and he pointed out (rightly) that\nresistance to his views was often based on little more than prejudice.\nFar from a reckless metaphysician, Fechner himself applied positivist\nstandards to his own metaphysics. We can dispute whether he met those\nstandards; but we can can do so only after a careful examination of\nhis argument. Even where his conclusions extend beyond the empirical\nevidence for them, they at least raise interesting questions and\npossibilities. Fechner\u2019s panpsychism raises the important\nquestion of the limits of consciousness: Is consciousness limited to\nhuman beings and animals? Or should we extend it to plants and indeed\nall organic beings?\n\nMany studies of Fechner are one-sided, emphasizing one side of him at\nthe expense of the other. Older scholarship tended to focus on his\nmetaphysical side, especially his panpsychism (see, for example,\nAdolph 1923; Bruchmann 1887; Pastor 1901a,b; Wille 1905; and Wentscher\n1924: 18\u201372). In reaction to such work, a more recent book by\nMichael Heidelberger finds \u201cthe heart of Fechner\u2019s\nphilosophy\u201d in his non-metaphysical side, and it stresses his\n\u201cnon-reductive materialism\u201d as the main achievement of his\nphilosophy (2004: 73\u201374). While Heidelberger\u2019s work is an\nimportant corrective to older scholarship, it still makes the same\nmistake: it too is one-sided. It is unconvincing because it\ndrastically underplays Fechner\u2019s panpsychism, which it simply\ndismisses as \u201cone of his most notorious ideas\u201d (2004: 3).\nThough odd by contemporary standards, panpsychism was Fechner\u2019s\ngeneral worldview, and its exposition and defense would preoccupy him\nfor much of his life. It is also deeply misleading to describe the\nheart of Fechner\u2019s philosophy as any form of materialism, even\nif it is a \u201cnon-reductive\u201d kind. Fechner not only had a\ndeep aversion to materialism, but he also insisted that belief in the\nexistence of matter is only the reification of an abstraction. There\nare indeed passages, which Heidelberger duly cites, where Fechner\ndescribes his philosophy as \u201cvery materialist\u201d; but in\nthose very same passages he also describes his philosophy as\n\u201cvery\n idealist\u201d.[1]\n\n\nThe chief purpose of this introductory article is to provide a brief\nsurvey of Fechner\u2019s most important philosophical\nwritings. No attempt is made to consider his writings on physics and\npsychology, which is the task for another article. The most important\nphilosophical writings are, in my opinion, Nanna,\nZend-Avesta and Ueber die physikalische und\nphilosophische\n Atomlehre.[2]\n These writings represent the two sides of Fechner\u2019s philosophy,\nthe metaphysical and positivist. There is also no attempt to provide\nan account of Fechner\u2019s Elemente der\nPsychophysik\u2014even though some contemporaries regarded it as\nhis most important work\u2014since its results are essentially\nempirical and have, on Fechner\u2019s own reading (see Fechner 1860:\nI, 6), little philosophical relevance. Because Fechner\u2019s\nphilosophy is incomprehensible without knowing about his life, this\narticle also includes two biographical sections, one on his early life\nand another on his mental breakdown. The latter section, though\nseemingly superfluous, is crucial because it is the source and\nmotivation for Fechner\u2019s mature philosophy. The article\nconcludes with a short analysis of Fechner\u2019s theory of mind,\nwhich is probably that aspect of his philosophy of most contemporary\ninterest. Finally,\n a supplement: \u201cDr. Mises\u2019 Merry Pranks\u201d\n contains a survey of Fechner\u2019s early pseudonymous writings,\nwhich should shed light on his philosophical development.\n2. Early Years\n\nGustav Theodor Fechner was born on April 19, 1801, in the then Saxon\nvillage of Gro\u00dfs\u00e4rchen. His father, Samuel Traugott Fischer\n(1765\u20131806), and indeed grandfather, were pastors in the\nvillage; and his mother, Dorothea Fechner (1744\u20131806), was also\nfrom a pastoral family. This religious background had a profound\neffect on Fechner, who would attempt to rationalize it in his\nphilosophy. \n\nGustav was the second of five children. He had an older brother,\nEduard Clemens (1799\u20131861), who was an artist, and who moved to\nParis in 1825; he had three younger sisters, Emilie, Clementine, and\nMathilde. Though only a village pastor, Samuel Fechner was a man of\nthe Enlightenment: he was the first in his village to inoculate his\nchildren; he put a lightning rod on the village church; and he was the\nfirst to give sermons without wearing a wig. By all accounts he was a\ncherished father; but he died when Gustav was only five. His death\nleft the family destitute. \n\nFechner showed great promise from an early age. He could speak Latin\neven as a boy. He learned quickly and studied avidly. When he was only\nfifteen, the Rektor of his Gymnasium said to him: \u201cFechner, you\nare still very young; you must leave because there is nothing more\nthat we can teach you\u201d (Kuntze 1892: 5). But, simply because he\nwas too young for the university, he had to stay an extra year in the\nGymnasium. When he was only sixteen, he went to the University of\nLeipzig. Since he could receive little help from his family, he had to\nrely on stipends and to give tutorials. Later Fechner would support\nhimself through translations and literary work. This reliance on hack\nliterary work, as we shall soon see, would prove fateful.\n\nFechner was, in the truest sense of the word, \u201cein\nLeipziger\u201d. Though he spent his childhood in\nGro\u00dfs\u00e4rchen and Dresden, he lived almost his entire life in\nLeipzig, from 1817 to 1887. He travelled outside it only for\nvacations, and only once for a short sojourn, a three month stay in\nParis in 1827. Leipzig was not intellectually restricting, however,\nsince, in the first half of the nineteenth century, it was in many\nrespects the cultural center of Germany. It was famous for its musical\nlife, for its book trade, and for its literary salons. It was called\n\u201cthe Paris of Germany\u201d. Fechner enjoyed this cultural life\nand was fully integrated into it.\n\nFechner first studied medicine, taking his Baccalaureate and doctoral\nexams in 1822. But he quickly became dissatisfied with the subject.\nAlthough he had the right to practice medicine, he confessed that he\ndid not have the least idea how to bleed an artery, to deliver\nchildren, or to apply a bandage (Kuntze 1892: 38). Medicine also did\nnot satisfy him as an intellectual discipline because its theories\nwere based more on authority and tradition rather than observation and\nexperiment. Because of his intellectual interests, Fechner soon\ngravitated toward physics, which applied higher standards and more\nrigorous methods than medicine. He gave up most of his lectures on\nmedicine and attended only the lectures of the physiologist Ernst\nHeinrich Weber (1795\u20131878) and the mathematician Karl Mollweide\n(1774\u20131825). For a while Fechner became Mollweide\u2019s\nassistant, but he confessed that he had little talent for mathematics\n(Kuntze 1892: 37). Weber\u2019s and Mollweide\u2019s work on\nperception would prove to be a profound influence on Fechner\u2019s\nlater psychophysics. \n\nA crucial event in Fechner\u2019s intellectual development came in\n1820 with his reading of Lorenz Oken\u2019s Lehrbuch zur\nNaturphilosophie (1809). Oken was an admirer of Schelling\u2019s\nNaturphilosophie, and in his Lehrbuch he set out to\nprovide a systematic exposition of its basic ideas and to reconcile\nits many opponents (in his \u201cVorrede\u201d [1809:\n v\u2013vi]).[3]\n Fechner was excited by Oken\u2019s breathtaking speculations about\nthe whole of nature. From his study of medicine he had become\naccustomed to see nature as a mechanism; but Oken gave him an exciting\nnew way of conceiving nature as an organic whole. Fechner later said\nof his first reading of Oken\u2019s book: \u201cA new light seemed\nto me to illuminate the whole world and the sciences of the world; I\nwas dazzled by it\u201d (Kuntze 1892: 39).\n\nFor the next four years, Fechner devoted himself to\nNaturphilosophie. Although he said that he little understood\nOken\u2019s book, of which he read only the first chapter, he went on\nto read other Naturphilosophen, especially Schelling and\nSteffens. He was indeed so involved in Naturphilosophie that\nin 1823 he wrote his PhD dissertation on it, Praemissae ad\ntheoriam organismi generalem (a summary is provided by Marilyn\nMarshall 1974b), which was a general theory of organisms. In 1824, in\na collection of essays, Stapelia mixta, he made his own\nproposals for the method of Naturphilosophie\n (1824).[4]\n\n\nIn the midst of his fascination with Naturphilosophie,\nFechner started writing satires under the pseudonym \u201cDr.\nMises\u201d. His first two publications were spoofs of the\npretensions and practices of the medicine of his day: Beweis,\nda\u00df der Mond aus Jodine bestehe (1821) and Panegyrikus\nder jezigen Medicin und Naturgeschichte (1822). These satires\nalso contain a critique of the methods of Naturphilosophie,\nwhich Dr. Mises chastened for its hasty analogies and its lack of\ncareful experimentation. Despite his awareness of its flaws, Fechner\ndid not lose his enthusiasm for Naturphilosophie. He believed\nthat its problems could be overcome by finding and employing the\nproper methodology. Hence the proposals in Stapelia mixta,\nwhich were designed to put Naturphilosophie on a sounder\nmethodological footing.\n\nHowever, in 1824, the very year in which Stapelia mixta\nappeared, Fechner seemed to have lost further confidence in\nNaturphilosophie. In that year he had begun to translate the\nFrench physicists Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard (1777\u20131857) and\nJena Baptiste Biot (1774\u20131862), whose work deeply impressed him\n(Th\u00e9nard 1813\u201316 [trans. 1825\u201328] and Biot 1817\n[trans. 1828\u201329]). By following careful methods of\nexperimentation and observation, the French physicists seemed to\nproduce definite results. Fechner asked himself if Oken and Schelling\ncould ever have produced the precise laws of optics found in\nBiot\u2019s work? (Kuntze 1892: 39\u201340). \n\nDespite such disillusionment, Naturphilosophie would remain a\nprofound influence on Fechner. There are two fundamental ideals of\nNaturphilosophie which would have an enduring effect on him:\nfirst, its ideal of a unified worldview; and, second, its organic\nconcept of nature. However much Fechner rejected the methods of\nNaturphilosophie, he was still excited by these ideals, which\nhe would never renounce. Already by 1824, then, there is a basic\ntension in Fechner\u2019s intellectual life: the hankering for\nspeculative Naturphilosophie and the demand for exact\nscience. \n\nIn the Winter Semester 1823\u201324, at the tender age of twenty-two,\nFechner began his academic career by lecturing on physiology for the\nfaculty of medicine. After the death of Ludwig Gilbert\n(1769\u20131824), the Leipzig professor of physics, in 1824, Fechner\nserved as his temporary substitute. Because he was still so young, the\nposition could not be made permanent. It was only in 1834 that Fechner\nfinally became professor of physics in Leipzig. \n\nDuring the 1820s, Fechner began his first experimental work, taking as\nhis subject the new and exciting field of electricity. He conducted\nexperiments to test, and to perfect the measurements for, Ohm\u2019s\n law,[5]\n which had been discovered in 1826, but which was at first very\ncontroversial. Fechner\u2019s exact observations and experiments were\nhighly praised and contributed to the general acceptance of\nOhm\u2019s law. The experiments were collected under the title\nMa\u00dfbestimmungen \u00fcber die galvanische Kette\n(Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1831). \n\nIn 1827 Fechner took a long journey through Bavaria, Salzburg, Tirol,\nand Switzerland, which finally ended with his three month stay in\nParis. There he finally met Biot and Th\u00e9nard as well as\nAndr\u00e9 Marie Amp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836); their exacting\nexperimental work served as a model for him. Fechner\u2019s\ntranslations of Biot and Th\u00e9nard played an important role in\ndisseminating French mathematical science in Germany. \n\nFrom 1838 to 1840 Fechner undertook experiments on the psychology of\nsense perception. In doing so he became part of a Leipzig tradition:\nin the 1830s Alfred Volkmann (1801\u20131877), and Ernst Heinrich\nWeber (1795\u20131878) and Eduard Friedrich Weber (1806\u20131871)\nhad conducted experiments on the psychology and physiology of sense\nperception. Fechner continued in that tradition by conducting\nexperiments on color perception. He wanted to investigate the\nconnection between the objective phenomenon of light and its\nsubjective perception. He discovered that the appearance of many color\nphenomena is due more to retinal fatigue rather than any property of\nlight itself. Fechner\u2019s results proved fruitful and were later\ntaken up by\n Helmholtz.[6]\n\nAlthough Fechner was making a name for himself, he was still nearly\ndestitute. His lecturing posts were either poorly paid or not paid at\nall, so he somehow had to make up for the lack of income. To keep the\nwolf from the door, he engaged in various translation and writing\nprojects. The most questionable of these projects was his editing\nBreitkopf and H\u00e4rtel\u2019s Hauslexikon, a household\nguide (1834). This work consisted in eight volumes, each containing\neight to nine hundred pages; a third of the articles had to be written\nby Fechner himself. So our philosopher found himself writing on the\nbest way to set the table and how to cut meat. Fechner\u2019s motive\nfor undertaking this work was totally financial: previous editions of\nthe Hauslexikon had been very profitable. But, as fortune\nwould have it, this edition proved to be a bust. Fechner\u2019s\nmighty labors were for very little gain. It was working on such\nprojects that so exhausted him, leading to his breakdown in 1840.\n3. The Breakdown\n\nThe most dramatic and fateful event in Fechner\u2019s life was his\nmental breakdown, which lasted for nearly four years, beginning in\nDecember 1839 and ending in October 1843. The breakdown was extremely\nsevere, leading to near death and loss of sanity. His mental and\nphysical collapse was the talk of Leipzig. No one expected Fechner to\ncome out of it. But, remarkably, he did. That he survived it at all,\nand then continued in a productive career, is astonishing. Fechner\nhimself regarded it as \u201ca miracle\u201d. \n\nFechner\u2019s breakdown was a watershed in his intellectual\ndevelopment. It forced him to reevaluate the orientation of his work.\nFrom now on, he would write on only what was important to him. No more\nhackwork. More importantly, during his recovery Fechner had a mystical\nexperience which it became his mission to spell out in philosophical\nprose. Some of Fechner\u2019s iconic works are the direct result of\nthis experience. \n\nThe story of the breakdown was told by Fechner himself in a memoir,\nentitled \u2018Krankheitsgeschichte\u2019, written in 1845\n(reproduced in Kuntze 1892: 106\u2013126). What follows are the\nhighlights of his story. \n\nIn the Autumn of 1839 the strain of overwork was beginning to take its\ntoll on Fechner. There were acute physical symptoms of mental stress.\nHe was suffering from headaches, insomnia and lethargy. But there were\nalso symptoms of neurosis. His thought was obsessive and compulsive.\nHe complained that his thinking was leading nowhere, that he would\nconstantly come back to the same point, that in doing so he was\nexhausting himself. It was impossible for him to stop thinking; he\ncould not relax or distract himself. Rather than he controlling his\nthinking, it was as if his thinking were controlling him. \n\nThe worst physical symptom of Fechner\u2019s growing illness was near\nblindness. He had strained his eyes doing his experimental work. He\nhad to look through colored glasses at the sun, so that images of\nbright objects would remain in his eyes. He also had to stare for long\nperiods at very fine measurement scales, which taxed his vision. His\nsight received \u201cits final blow\u201d in 1840. His eyes became\nso sensitive to light that he could not open them. He had to live in a\ncompletely darkened room and to wear a blindfold. Because of the\ndeterioration of his sight, he had to abandon reading and writing; and\nbecause he could not read or write, he could not work. His great enemy\nbecame boredom. All could have been bearable to him if he could only\nsleep; but his insomnia was relentless. \n\nThough Fechner could not read himself, someone could still read to\nhim. For a while, this was his only source of stimulation. His wife\nwould often read to him; so would a friend, who would visit him daily.\nThat friend was no less than the young Hermann Lotze, who was just\nthen beginning his writing career. But, eventually, even his visits\nhad to stop. Fechner could not bear the strain of listening. There\ncould be only complete silence in that darkened room.\n\nAnything that involved mental effort was now unbearable to Fechner.\nBecause even conversation was impossible for him, he avoided all\ncontact with others, even his wife. And so Fechner became completely\nisolated, from the world and others. He was utterly alone in that\nblack and silent room. \n\nDesperate, Fechner finally made the fateful decision to listen to his\ndoctors. They would attempt an experimental remedy from traditional\nChinese medicine. They would apply to his back moxa\u2014a down of\ndried leaves from the plant Artemisia moxa. The immediate\neffect was to create swellings, which left scars on his back; but the\nlong-term effect was much worse: digestion became impossible. Now\nFechner could not eat or drink; he quickly became emaciated. He was on\nthe brink of starvation. \n\nFechner was rescued from starvation by a woman who was acquainted with\nhis family. She had read of his illness, and dreamed of a remedy for\nit. She sent him pieces of dried ham, cleaned of all fat. To his\nsurprise, Fechner enjoyed eating it, and he gradually recovered his\nstrength through it. \n\nSome of the symptoms Fechner describes in the depths of his illness\nsound like schizophrenia. He complained that his thoughts were beyond\nhis control. They would arise from very incidental reasons and he\ncould not stop them. As he wrote of his state of mind: \u201cMy inner\nbeing divided itself into two parts: in my self and in my\nthoughts.\u201d (114)\n\nFechner later wrote that only two things prevented him from sinking\ninto complete oblivion: the care of his wife and his religious faith.\nHe was especially strengthened and comforted by the thought that there\nwas compensation in another life for the sorrows endured in this life.\nThese eschatological themes will later play a central role in his\ntheory of religion. \n\nThe worst month of his illness, Fechner later wrote, was August 1843.\nIt seemed he could not sink any further into depression, and that\nthere could be neither rescue nor redemption from all his suffering.\nBut, slowly and gradually, a process of recovery began in October. He\nfound that he could now speak without having unpleasant sensations,\nand that the more he spoke, the more he liked speaking. With\nself-confidence and prudence, his powers gradually strengthened. For a\nfew seconds, he could open his eyes without feeling any pain; he later\nfound that he could do this for longer moments. Fechner told himself\nthat he was not merely passive, that he had the power to exercise his\neyes, and that he could make them stronger. Eventually, he wrote, they\nfelt \u201ca real hunger for light\u201d. \n\nThus Fechner cured himself. It was as if it were all a question of\nwill power. He found a source of strength within himself, a power to\ngo out and meet the world. He now believed that he had allowed himself\nto sink into nothingness; if he was the source of his\nself-annihilation, he reasoned, he could also be the source of his\nself-affirmation. And so by Christmas of 1843, full of hope and\nconfidence, Fechner walked out of his dark night, a new man. He would\nbe a productive writer for the next forty four years.\n4. The Soul of Plants\n\nFechner has gone down in history as \u201cthe father of\npanpsychism\u201d. But that phrase is problematic. We should drop the\nclaim to paternity since the doctrine is very old and has had a wealth\nof followers, both in ancient and modern times. The more important\nquestion is whether it is accurate to describe Fechner\u2019s\nphilosophy as \u201cpanpsychism\u201d. The label is correct if it\nmeans the following: the doctrine that all living beings are psychic,\ni.e., have the power of\n consciousness.[7]\n\n\nWe should distinguish panpsychism from organicism. The panpsychist\nholds that all living beings are psychic where the psyche involves the\npower of consciousness; the organicists holds that living beings are\nnot necessarily psychic, that their living powers might not be\nconscious but only be subconscious drives. Organicism is ambiguous: it\ncan mean \n\n the doctrine that everything in the universe is alive; or \n the doctrine that the universe is organic in structure, i.e.,\nforms a whole where the whole precedes the parts and makes them\npossible.\n\n\nIt is possible to hold (a) and (b); but it is also possible to hold\n(b) and not (a) if one thinks that there are inorganic parts within\nthe organic whole. Organicists are not necessarily panpsychists\nbecause they might hold that there are living creatures who are not\nconscious; panpsychists are organicists at least in sense (b) but not\nnecessarily in sense (a). Fechner was an organicist in sense (b) but\nnot (a) because he held that there is such a thing as inorganic nature\n(Fechner 1879: 37). \n\nFechner\u2019s first exposition of panpsychism is his Nanna oder\n\u00fcber das Seelenleben der Pflanzen, which he first published\nin 1848. Nanna took the first step toward panpsychism by\narguing that plants are conscious beings, having a life of feeling and\nvolition. In his Zend-Avesta, which first appeared in 1851,\nFechner took his panpsychism a giant step further by contending that\nplanets, and indeed the cosmos as a whole, are also psychic or mental.\nFechner defended and elaborated his panpsychism in two works of the\nearly 1860s: Ueber die Seelenfrage (1861) and Die Drei\nMotive and Gr\u00fcnde des Glaubens (1863). His final exposition\nof his doctrine appears in his Die Tagesansicht gegen\u00fcber der\nNachtansicht (1879).\n\nFechner\u2019s panpsychism originated from a mystical experience\nwhich came at the end of his mental\n breakdown.[8]\n The day he began to see again, 5 October 1843, he walked into the\ngarden of his house to look at the plants and flowers. Now the whole\nworld appeared alive to him; it seemed for the first time to reveal\nitself to him. The flowers were all illuminated, as if from within.\nThe light they shed seemed to come from their very souls. \n\n\nThe whole garden seemed to me transformed, as if not I but all of\nnature were arisen anew; and I thought, it is only a matter of opening\nmy eyes again to allow a nature grown old to become young again.\n(Nanna: 65) \n\n\nFrom that day onward, Fechner made it his mission to be true to that\nexperience, to capture its meaning in philosophical prose. The\nultimate results of his efforts were Nanna and\nZend-Avesta. \n\nThough Fechner\u2019s panpsychism arose from a mystical experience,\nit is not based upon it; that experience was the origin of his view,\nnot the rationale for it. Fechner insisted in both Nanna and\nZend-Avesta that his doctrine was based upon the best natural\nscience. While he did not claim certainty or finality for his\ndoctrine, he still maintained that it was the most \u201clikely\nstory\u201d given the latest findings of empirical research. \n\nFechner explains the title of his work in his forward (Nanna:\nxi). He wanted a short and catchy name for his book. He first\nconsidered \u201cFlora\u201d and \u201cHamadryas\u201d; but then\nhe found the first too botanical and the second too archaic. Just the\nright name came from Uhland\u2019s work on Nordic mythology (1836:\n147\u2013148). Nanna was the goddess of flowers, the wife of Baldur,\nthe god of light. \n\nFechner writes that it is the purpose of his work to show how plants\nare part of a world ensouled by God (Nanna: xiii). It then\nseems as if panpsychism can be proven simply from the omnipresence of\nGod. But Fechner explicitly rejects this strategy because it would\nmake the question of the soul of plants depend on general metaphysical\nquestions, such as the relationships between God and nature or mind\nand body (Nanna: 7). Furthermore, even if we could prove the\nomnipresence of the divine mind, Fechner adds, it still would not\nprove that each individual thing is conscious. It would still be\npossible for the divine mind to be omnipresent in nature even though\nno individual thing is conscious (Nanna: 3). For these\nreasons, Fechner will investigate the question of the soul of plants\non its own, apart from any general metaphysics; he asks: What evidence\ndo we have for the common view that only humans and animals but not\nplants have souls? \n\nAll belief in the existence of other minds, Fechner reminds us, is\nbased on analogy. We assume that other humans have minds because their\nspeech and actions are like our own; and we infer that animals have\nminds because, in crucial respects, their actions are like our own.\nBut we must be careful with analogy, Fechner warns, because we cannot\ndemand that other creatures be exactly like ourselves in all respects.\nThe very nature of analogy means that they are like us in some\nrespects but unlike us in others. We are permitted to infer, because\nanalogies do not exactly hold, that other creatures have minds\nsimilar to our own; but similarity does not mean identical or\nalike in all respects. Their minds could still be, in other respects,\nvery different from our own. Though we assume that worms have souls,\nwe recognize that they are very different ones from our own\n(Nanna: 6). Why cannot we then say that plants too have\nsouls, though very different ones from us?\n\nFechner makes it his business to argue that all the reasons for\nascribing souls to animals also hold for plants (Nanna: 7).\nPlants and animals have very similar structures and functions. They\nshare a similar pattern of development (birth, maturity, death); both\nhave similar cellular structures; both require nutrition, both engage\nin digestion, excretion, respiration. All that we can infer from the\ndifferences in their organic structure, function and development is\nthat plants have different souls than our own, not that they\nhave no souls at all (Nanna: 9).\n\nThe most common reason for denying souls to plants, Fechner notes, is\nthat they do not have a central nervous system. If one destroys the\nnerves of a human or animal, they show no signs of life. It therefore\nseems that plants cannot a have a soul because they have no nervous\nsystem. But here Fechner raises an interesting question: Are nerves\nthe only possible organs to produce sensation? Nature has many means\nto the same end, and we should not assume that there is only one way\nto produce sensation. If we cut all the strings of a violin, it\nproduces no sound; but not all instruments are stringed. We can\nproduce sound from wind instruments. Similarly, nature might have many\nmeans of creating sensations apart from a nervous system\n(Nanna: 28). The fibers of plants could perform the same\nfunction as nerves.\n\nAnother common reason for denying souls to plants is that they are not\ncapable of locomotion, of changing their position, as humans and\nanimals are (Nanna: 41, 71). But why should motion to\ndifferent places be necessary for life?, Fechner asks. Plants move\ntoo, its just that they move vertically rather than horizontally. One\nmaintains that the movements of plants are not voluntary, like that of\nhumans and animals, because they are subject to physical necessity.\nBut Fechner replies that the actions of animals too can be shown to be\nphysically necessary. The mere necessity of an action\u2014its\nexplicability according to mechanical causes\u2014does not show that\nit cannot be also accompanied by internal or mental events\n(Nanna: 79). \n\nA weak point of Fechner\u2019s argument is that he never sufficiently\nclarifies what he means by the soul or mind. His argument is cast in\nthe language of having \u201ca soul\u201d, which makes it seem as if\nhe means a special kind of substance. He tells us that by a soul\n(Seele) he means the same thing as mind (Geist); but\nthis only kicks the can down the road: What are the criteria of a\nmind? The crucial consideration for Fechner seems to be sentience,\nconsciousness or awareness, or at least the possibility of it. Even\nthe most primitive plants, he argues, have consciousness or feeling;\nthough it might not be on the level of humans and animals, it is still\nat least as lively and intense (Nanna: 188). This is\ninteresting because Fechner seems to exclude the possibility of the\nsubconscious; he does not allow, as Leibniz famously did, the\nexistence of subconscious living creatures. In some places, Fechner\nseems to hold that having feelings and desires are sufficient for the\npresence of a mind; but he also writes that there can be sensation and\ndesire without consciousness (Nanna: 53). In other places, he\nmakes purposive activity a necessary condition of having a mind. Only\na being with a soul has a purpose, he says (Nanna: 152). The\ncrucial consideration for an organism, he also contends, is that its\norganization allows it to effectively achieve its ends\n(Nanna: 191). But this too becomes troubled because Fechner\nconcedes that there can be purposive or organic development without\nany awareness of it (Nanna: 87).\n\nOne of the most important differences between Fechner\u2019s\npanpsychism and Schelling\u2019s and Hegel\u2019s idealism is that,\nfor Schelling and Hegel, the ideal does not necessarily imply the\npresence of consciousness. What makes a creature living is its\npurposive activity, which need not imply that its activity is directed\nby consciousness. These differences with the idealist tradition\neventually became public in Fechner\u2019s sharp criticism of Eduard\nvon Hartmann\u2019s Die Philosophie des Unbewussten, which\nput forward a strong case for the presence of subconscious life\nthroughout nature (see Fechner 1879:\n 22).[9]\n\n5. The Soul of the Universe\n\nZend-Avesta is Fechner\u2019s most personal work, the\nstatement of his fundamental beliefs. It is nineteenth century\nmetaphysics in the grand style, on a par with Schopenhauer\u2019s\nDie Welt als Wille und Vorstellung and Lotze\u2019s\nMikrokosmus. It is a much more ambitious work than\nNanna. Whereas Nanna would deal strictly with the\nrealm of botany, Zend-Avesta would consider the cosmos as a\nwhole. While Nanna would prove only that plants have souls,\nZend-Avesta would attempt to show that the entire\norganic universe has a\n soul.[10]\n Although this panpsychic doctrine was the inspiration for\nNanna, Fechner, as we have seen, refused to make it the basis\nof his argument. Now, in Zend-Avesta, it will be his purpose\nto prove this doctrine. \n\nZend-Avesta is unapologetically religious. Fechner conceives\nit as a defense of ancient natural religion. In his preface he writes\nthat its purpose is to restore an old belief: \u201cthat all of\nnature is living and divinely ensouled\u201d (ZA: vi).\nZend-Avesta, which means \u201cliving word\u201d in ancient\nPersian, was the sacred text of Zoroastrianism. Fechner hopes that his\nwork will be a new Zend-Avesta (ZA: vii).\n\nAlthough it has a religious agenda, Zend-Avesta was no\ndefense of the Christian faith. Fechner\u2019s natural religion was\ndecidedly not Christianity. His denial of a transcendent dimension\nbeyond nature, his insistence that the mental be embodied in the\nphysical, and his affirmation of a God of nature, all depart\ndrastically from Christian dogma. Still, Fechner was sympathetic to\nChristianity\u2014the faith of his family and fathers\u2014and\nattempted to interpret many of its beliefs in terms of his\n philosophy.[11]\n He conceived his own religion as a synthesis of Christianity and\npaganism (Fechner 1879: 71).\n\nDespite his religious agenda, Fechner insists that he intends to base\nhis faith upon the best science. This work follows a different course\nfrom most Naturphilosophie, he writes, because it does not\nbegin from universal principles and descend to matter of fact; rather,\nit begins from an examination of the particulars of experience and\nascends to the universal. \u201cThe whole tendency of this\nwriting\u201d, he says in the preface, \u201cis that the universal\nrests on the particular rather than the particular on the\nuniversal.\u201d (ZA: xiii) It will show that the realm of\nthe soul is much wider than usually thought, and then proceed to\ndemonstrate that it extends to the universe as a whole. \n\nThere was some equivocation on Fechner\u2019s part on the basis for\nhis natural religion. Although he insisted that it had to be based on\nscience, he had to admit that it could not be based on \u201cexact\nresearch\u201d (ZA: vii, xiv). The very nature of the\nsubject matter did not permit \u201cempirical confirmation and\nmathematical calculation\u201d. Furthermore, he vacillates concerning\nhow it is based on empirical fact. He insists that he will allow only\ninferences based on experience; but then he says that his theory is in\norder as long as it does not contradict the results of science\n(ZA: xiv). He then went on to admit that to believe in the\nsoul of the stars would be always \u201ca matter of faith\u201d\n(Glaubenssache; ZA: 7). \n\nWe should contrast Fechner\u2019s attitude toward religion and\nscience with the materialists of his day (Feuerbach, Vogt,\nB\u00fcchner, Moleschott). It was a major advantage of his philosophy,\nFechner claimed, that it could reconcile science with religion. The\nmaterialists saw this as no advantage at all; they insisted that\nmodern science was moving in the direction of materialism, which made\nit necessary to reject all the religious dogmas of the past. Fechner\nwas well aware of the threat of materialism and did his best to\ncounter it. His constant appeal to science was an attempt to meet the\nmaterialists on their own ground. \n\nTo prove that the universe has a soul, Fechner again follows the\nguiding thread of analogy, just as he did in Nanna. He begins\nby considering the body closest to us: the earth. He finds many\nsimilarities between the earth and our body: both are self-enclosed\npurposive wholes; both consist in solid, fluid, gaseous materials in\nmanifold connections; both go through cycles of changes; both go\nthrough processes of development whereby they become differentiated\nand more finely organized (ZA: 29\u201331). Furthermore, the\nearth has a circulatory system like that of our body (ZA:\n73\u201374). Because of these many similarities, we are justified in\nconcluding, Fechner argues, that the earth is an individual organism\n(ZA: 35). Of course, because it is a much greater organism,\nthere is much in the earth that one does not find in man; but there is\nnothing in man that one does not already find in the earth\n(ZA: 37). The main difference between the human body and the\nearth is that the earth is a higher organism than the body; this is\nbecause it is more independent, self-sufficient, massive and powerful\n(ZA: 31). All the characteristics of the human\norganism\u2014unity, multiplicity, organization and development from\nwithin\u2014the earth has to a greater degree (ZA:\n35\u20136). \n\nHaving demonstrated that the earth is an organism, Fechner proceeds to\nargue that it also has a soul. Because the earth has a body much like\nour own, we are justified, on the basis of analogy, to assume that it\nhas a soul much like our own (ZA: 110\u2013111). If we\nregard freedom as a necessary characteristic of the soul, we should\nalso attribute it to the earth, which is an even more self-sufficient\nand independent being (ZA: 113). All the respects in which\nthe earth is unlike us are only reasons to attribute to it a higher\nsoul (ZA: 115). To the objection that the earth does not have\na nervous system and other organic functions like ours, Fechner\nreplies that, though the presence of these functions proves a soul,\ntheir absence does not disprove the soul either but only the lack of\nan animal or human soul (ZA: 130). It is\neasier to prove that the earth has a soul than plants do, Fechner\nclaims, for the simple reason that we have souls and are part of the\nearth (ZA: 120). We are all parts of the earth, Fechner\nargues at length, and just for that reason the earth must have also a\nsoul, because a soul cannot arise from matter but only another soul\n(ZA: 140\u20131). \n\nFechner conceives the soul of the earth as present within all\nindividual souls, much like Averro\u00ebs famous doctrine of the\nuniversal intellect. All the different representations in one mind\npresuppose a single general consciousness; but the same is the case\nfor the different representations in different minds: they too\npresuppose a general consciousness (ZA: 160\u20131). What we\nperceive or think as an individual mind we perceive or think through\nthe general mind (ZA: 164). This single common consciousness\nin all individual consciousness explains, Fechner believes, how mutual\nunderstanding and communication are possible. Although we are\nindependent and self-sufficient with respect to one another, that is\nnot with respect to the higher mind. That I know myself and only\nmyself, and that you know yourself and only yourself, does not prevent\nthe higher spirit from knowing both of us. What is separation\n(Scheidung) for us is only a distinction\n(Unterscheidung) for it. \n\nThe earth is only one planet in the cosmos, and as such only one\norganism within an infinite one, one mind within an infinite one. The\nuniversal organism is nothing less than God, who is the tree of life,\nfrom which everything grows and upon which everything depends\n(ZA: 23). God is not above space and time, Fechner\ninsists, but he is within them. He not only does\neverything in all things, but he is everything in all things\n(ZA: 200). \u201cGod is the one and all\u201d (ZA:\n223), Fechner says, endorsing the hen kai pan of the\nGoethezeit. The external world of appearances is not opposed\nto God, but it is simply his external side (ZA: 201).\nGod\u2019s spirit does not stand outside the material world but\nexpresses itself in and through it. Fechner distinguishes between a\nnarrower and broader concept of God: the narrow concept is God as\nspirit alone; the broader concept is spirit and its\nembodiment in the world (ZA: 200\u20131). In the same way,\nhe says, we talk about a person as a personality but also as a whole\nbeing involving its body. But it is noteworthy that Fechner says that\nGod in the narrow sense, i.e., God as a pure spirit, is only an\nabstraction (ZA: 204). The concept of the world in a broad\nsense, in which it includes spiritual and physical existence,\ncoincides with the concept of God (ZA: 204). Fechner admits\nthat, in this sense, his view is pantheistic, but he insists that it\nis not so in the Hegelian sense in which the spirit exists\nonly in its individual manifestations. \n6. The Existence of Atoms\n\nIn 1855 Fechner published a book much less famous than Nanna\nand Zend-Avesta but one just as important for the exposition\nof his philosophy: \u00dcber die physikalische und philosophische\nAtomlehre. While Nanna and Zend-Avesta make up\nthe speculative or metaphysical side of Fechner\u2019s philosophy,\nthe Atomlehre represents its positivist side. It is in this\nwork that Fechner puts forward his phenomenalism and verificationism.\nAll that exists, and all that we can meaningfully talk about, it now\nturns out, is an object of possible experience. It is as if the soul\nof the universe were swept away with a positivist broom\n\nThe Atomlehre was Fechner\u2019s contribution to a major\ncontroversy in the mid nineteenth century: the existence of the atom.\nFechner argued that, by the best standards of observation and\nexperiment then current in physics, the most probable view is that\natoms really do exist; they are not only a convenient fiction or a\nfallacious hypostasis. The simplest and most consistent interpretation\nof the data of observation and experiment is that there are atoms\nbehind the laws of experience. \n\nThe question of the existence of the atom had divided philosophy and\nnatural science against one another. The philosophers held that atoms\nare only a fiction or hypostasis, while the physicists claimed that\nthey are a reality, the best inference from observation and\nexperiment, even though they are unobservable themselves. This\ndisagreement among philosophers and scientists reflected their wider\ndisagreements about the nature of matter and scientific method. They\nwere opposed on three fronts. First, the philosophers held that matter\nis infinitely divisible and continuous, while the scientists\nmaintained that it is indivisible and discrete. Second, the\nphilosophers made forces fundamental, analyzing matter into powers of\nattraction and repulsion; the scientists, however, made matter the\nbasis of force, claiming that forces inhere in matter and that they\nare only a way of accounting for its law-like regularities. Third, the\nphilosophers stated that the fundamental questions about nature cannot\nbe settled by observation and experiment and have to be determined\na priori; the physicists insisted that every question of\nnatural science has to be determined by observation and experiment and\nthat questions about its very possibility are not the concern of\nnatural science. The chief philosophers, who were all Germans, were\nSchelling, Hegel and Herbart; their philosophy of nature was in the\ntradition of Kant\u2019s Metaphysische Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der\nNaturwissenschaften. The main scientists, who were French, were\none and all experimental physicists, men like Andr\u00e9\nAmp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836), Augustin Cauchy (1858\u20131898) and\nAugustin Fresnel (1788\u20131827).\n\nAtomism had become such a controversial issue in the mid nineteenth\ncentury partly because of the rise of materialism, and partly because\nof the traditional reputation of atomism. Materialism had become a\nrising force in German philosophy in the early 1850s; and by\n1855\u2014the very year Fechner published his work\u2014Karl Vogt,\nHeinrich Czolbe, and Ludwig B\u00fcchner published their manifestos of\nmaterialism (Vogt 1855; B\u00fcchner 1855; Czolbe 1855). The German\nmaterialists were not unqualified champions of atomism. Though Czolbe\nhad explicitly defended it (1855: 105 and 1875: 95), B\u00fcchner was\nmore cautious, stating only that the atom was still a working\nhypothesis (1855 [1904: 39\u201340]). Nevertheless, the reputation of\natomism as a materialist doctrine had been formed since antiquity.\nAtomism, whose chief exposition was Lucretius\u2019 De rerum\nnaturae, stood for a completely naturalistic worldview.\n\nAs one could surmise from the author of Nanna and\nZend-Avesta, Fechner was not sympathetic to materialism and\nlamented its rising power in German life and letters. It was one of\nthe most interesting features of his book that it would attempt to\nbreak the traditional association of atomism with materialism. Fechner\nargued that atomism does not necessarily support materialism, and that\nit is indeed ultimately a better support for the beliefs in the\nexistence of God and immortality than the opposing view of the\nphilosophers. Part I of Atomlehre lays out the experimental\nevidence for physical atomism; but Part II states the case\nfor a philosophical atomism which supports a metaphysics\navowing the existence of God and immortality. The battle between\nphilosophy and physics about the existence of the atom should not be\nseen, at least in Fechner\u2019s view, as a struggle between faith\nand science. \n\nThe most remarkable feature of Fechner\u2019s book is that it is a\ndefense of atomism at all. In Nanna and Zend-Avesta\nFechner had expounded the organic vision of the universe so\ncharacteristic of romanticism. The support for that organic vision, as\nset forth by the Naturphilosophen (Schelling, Hegel, and\nHerbart), had been the dynamic theory of matter, according to which\nmatter consists essentially in living force. If matter consists in\nforce, the Naturphilosophen argued, then there is no\nfundamental difference in kind between mind and matter, because they\nare only different degrees of development and organization of force.\nIt was just this view of matter, however, that Fechner had rejected in\nhis Atomlehre. He was very explicit that force presupposes\nthe existence of matter, that trying to analyze matter into these\nforces was like trying to analyze sounds into the intervals between\nthem (Atom: 112, 113). But this repudiation of dynamicism\ninevitably poses the question: Did Fechner\u2019s atomism not\nundermine his\n organicism?[12]\n\n\nThe chief reason that Fechner advocates atomism is because he thinks\nthat it better explains the facts than its rival, dynamicism. Atomism\nis not simply a good model of explanation but the correct ontology,\ni.e., the right account of what exists in the world. That is to say,\natomism does not work simply on a hypothetical basis: if\natoms exist, then we can account for the phenomena; rather, it\npostulates that atoms do exist, and that only as such do they explain\nphenomena. The atomist knows that the existence of atoms cannot be\nconfirmed by experience; but he still insists that the only way to\nexplain what we do know about experience is to assume the existence of\natoms (Atom: 25, 30). Here again the natural scientist\nfollows the guide of analogy. He assumes that the same laws that hold\nfor the macroscopic world also hold for the microscopic, an assumption\nwhich brings consistency into his general worldview (Atom:\n33, 35\u20136, 88). Fechner concedes that many phenomena explicable\naccording to atomism are also explicable according to dynamicism; but\nhe insists that there always comes a point where phenomena reveal\nthemselves that dynamicism cannot explain (Atom: 13, 21, 24).\nWhen we examine mass macroscopic phenomena in greater\ndetail\u2014taking them apart into their microscopic\nconstituents\u2014we find that the facts we then discover are\nexplicable according to atomism alone. \n\nFechner cites the following experiments and phenomena in favor of\natomism. \n\nThe refraction of a ray of light into different colors was often\nregarded as a difficulty of the wave theory of light. Why should a\nsingle transparent ray suddenly transform itself into a multitude of\ncolors? The investigations of Cauchy have shown, however, that\nrefraction into different colors follows from, and is not\nonly consistent with, wave theory if one supposes that there\nare discrete particles in the aether (Atom:\n 18).[13]\n\nA heat ray (W\u00e4rmestralung) and heat conduction\n(W\u00e4rmefortpfanzung) seem to be very different phenomena.\nBut Fourier has demonstrated that conduction follows under the same\nlaws that hold for rays provided that one assumes rays consist in\ndiscrete particles (Atom: 22). \nThe phenomena of isomery\u2014objects having the same mass and\nchemical constitution but producing different experimental\nresults\u2014are explicable only according to atomism. The atomist\nassumes that there is something more to atoms beside their mass and\nchemical constitution: namely, their direction or positions. The\ndifferent results are then ascribed to the different directions or\npositions of the atoms (Atom: 37). The dynamicist, however,\ncan refer to only mass and chemical constitution.\nTwo crystal formations can be exactly alike in their parts and\nstructure even though they are incongruous with one another. The\natomist explains their incongruity from the different directions of\ntheir constituent atoms (Atom: 43)\nA rubber band, when stretched, eventually breaks in one place. The\ndynamicist cannot explain this break in a single place; his adherence\nto the principle of continuity forces him to claim that the rubber\nband stretches ad infinitum or breaks in all places. The\natomist explains the break from the growing distance between particles\ninside the band; the attraction between the particles lessens as the\nband stretches and the distance between the particles grows\n(Atom: 54\u201355) \nWhen a body expands because of heat, its density diminishes as its\nvolume increases (Atom: 45). The atomist can easily explain\nthis: the particles spread further apart from one another as the body\nis heated. \nThe atomist can explain organic development\u2014the\ndifferentiation of a primal mass into a multitude of organs and\nfunctions\u2014better than the dynamicist, because he claims that the\noriginal apparently undifferentiated mass in fact consists in many\ndifferent kinds of particles with their different structures\n(Atom: 60\u201362). The dynamicist, who chastens the atomist\nfor speculation beyond experience, can refer to only the small visible\ndifferences between primal masses, which are not sufficient to explain\ndifferentiation or the differences between individuals. \n\n\nAs case 1 demonstrates, Fechner still holds an aether theory. He even\nincludes the aether into his summary of his doctrine, according to\nwhich ponderable matter consists in spatially discrete parts, in\nbetween which there is an imponderable substance or aether\n(Atom: 79). Fechner admits, however, that there is much\nuncertainty about the relation of ponderable to imponderable matter.\nHe knew that the aether theory was problematic, though this did not\nstop him from referring to Cauchy\u2019s experiments. In the\nintroduction to Part I of Atomlehre, he is explicit that\natomism does not depend on the theory of aether (Atom:\n14\u201315). The question whether light or heat are atomistically\nexplicable is independent of the existence of the aether, he insists.\n\n\nIt was a crucial aspect of Fechner\u2019s defense of atomism that it\nmade no philosophical claims about the nature of matter itself. Its\nfoundation lies simply with its explanation of empirical phenomena; it\ndoes not attempt to answer deeper philosophical questions about the\npossibility of matter and experience. As Fechner put it: the physicist\ndoes not worry about a philosophical analysis of matter anymore than a\nbuilder troubles himself about the chemical analysis of his brick and\nmortar (Atom: 72). The philosopher always claimed that the\natomist did not go far enough in his analysis of matter, that he did\nnot try to answer ultimate questions. What he fails to see, however,\nis that the physicist does not attempt to answer such questions; he is\nonly trying to explain the data given in experience. From this modest\nempirical point of view, Fechner was willing to make significant\nconcessions to the dynamicist: perhaps matter did ultimately consist\nin forces of attraction and repulsion (Atom: 72); perhaps the\nspaces between matter were ultimately filled, so that everything is\ncontinuous after all (Atom: 76). \n\nBut this modest empiricist defense of atomism was disingenuous. It was\nonly half the story. For Fechner had a more aggressive philosophical\ndefense of atomism, a positivist-style counterattack which claimed\nthat the questions posed by the philosopher are meaningless. Unlike\nthe physicist, the philosopher does not intend to stay within the\nlimits of experience; he attempts to go beyond these limits to find\nthe conditions of their possibility. What makes experience possible\nfor him is the unconditioned, the thing-in-itself; and his\nspeculations therefore are so many attempts to know the\nthing-in-itself. But the thing-in-itself, Fechner insists, is an\nillusion, something which does not really exist (Atom: 94,\n98). The world does not consist in the appearances of a\nthing-in-itself but in nothing more than appearances (Atom:\n94). Matter is only what appears, or what would appear under certain\ncircumstances (Atom: 95). The idea that there is something\nbehind the appearances, something that makes them all one thing, is\nsimply an hypostasis, the reification of a concept that unites all\nthese appearances into one (Atom: 96). As part of this\ncounterattack, Fechner went on to argue that the dynamicist\u2019s\nconcept of force or power is only a reification of the concept of a\nlaw (Atom: 106). It did not even make sense to analyze a body\ninto its powers because power is only a relational concept between\nbodies; to attempt to construct matter from powers would be like\nconstructing sound from tone intervals (Atom: 112). \n\nAlso in the spirit of this counterattack, Fechner sets out a\ndefinition of matter which spurns any philosophical account of it.\nMatter is defined as what resists the sense of touch; it is nothing\nmore nor less than \u201ctangibility\u201d\n(Handgreiflichkeit) (Atom: 90). In response to the\nphilosopher, who asks what is it that is so tangible, Fechner replies\nthat it is nothing more than what he feels and what he infers from\nthat feeling (Atom: 92). Fechner does not then allow the\nphilosopher to speculate about the sources or conditions of that\nfeeling. Rather, he claims the very idea that there is something\nbehind this feeling, that there is a reality that that makes it\npossible, is an illusion (Atom: 94). \n\nHence Fechner\u2019s defense of atomism is not what it first appears\nto be, or at least not what he pretends it to be. It does not carve\nout a realm of experience in which atomism holds, then leaving aside a\ntranscendent realm which is the proper domain of metaphysics. Instead,\nFechner argues that there is no such transcendent realm and that\nmetaphysics deludes itself when it speculates about it. In this\nrespect, Fechner\u2019s attack on metaphysics anticipates exactly\nwhat Otto Liebmann would write ten years later in his famous Kant\nund die Epigonen (1865). \n\nThough he was very aggressive in his attack on the philosophers,\nFechner insisted that he had nothing against philosophy per\nse; his target was only contemporary philosophy,\nspecifically the metaphysics of Schelling, Hegel, and Herbart\n(Atom: xiii). The second part of his book was indeed devoted\nto his own philosophy, his own metaphysics of matter. It would give up\nthe empirical limits on physical atomism, and then attempt to\nprovide a philosophical atomism, which would give \u201cthe\nultimate construction of matter itself\u201d (Atom: viii).\nFechner reassured his readers that he was not sacrificing their\ndemands for a worldview and that he would sketch one of his own. He\nexpressed his complete agreement with the philosophers about the need\nto investigate \u201cthe most universal, the highest and the\nultimate\u201d; he said that he differed from them only in\nhow he wanted to conduct such an investigation. While\nSchelling, Hegel and Herbart had followed an a priori\nmethodology, which preceded natural science, Fechner insisted on an\na posteriori methodology which would be based upon the\nnatural sciences. His metaphysics would come after, not\nprior to or before, physics (Atom: 126).\nThe foundation for his metaphysics would be nothing less than the\nwhole of natural science (Atom: 127). \n\nThe great hope of Fechner, like many other philosophers of his age\n(Trendelenburg, Lotze, Hartmann), was that the natural sciences could\nprovide a worldview more reliable than the a priori methods\nof the old metaphysics. The old metaphysics here was not simply the\nrationalism of Leibniz and Wolff but the metaphysics of natural\nscience of Kant, Schelling, Hegel and Herbart, which was still\nindebted to the old rationalism in its faith in pure reason. This new\nworldview would still be able to satisfy the interests of morality and\nreligion; and it would disarm the threat of materialism, which\nregarded the old morality and religion as little more than\nsuperstition. \n\nThe distinguishing feature of Fechner\u2019s new metaphysics is his\ninsistence that it is based upon experience alone rather than the\na priori reasoning of the old Naturphilosophie.\nAccordingly, the basic principle of his philosophical atomism is that\natoms are \u201climiting concepts\u201d in the analysis of\nexperience. This means that they represent the ultimate units of\nanalysis hitherto, so that they involve no claim that the\nanalysis is complete. Atoms must be defined strictly in relation to\nthe empirically given; they are not points behind or beyond space and\ntime but within it; but there is always the stipulation that however\nsmall they are represented to be is never enough (Atom: 132).\nThey appear to our representation as the smallest visible and tangible\npoints; yet they are are smaller than the smallest we can see and\ntouch (Atom: 156). \n\nFechner\u2019s new metaphysics did not avoid the problems or the\nconcepts of the old metaphysics; it simply cast them in a\nquasi-empirical dress. Though Fechner adamantly insists that his atoms\nbe defined empirically, he goes on to attribute to them the classic\nproperties of the monad, all of which transcend the empirically given.\nThus he writes that his atoms are utterly simple beings, having no\ncharacteristics (Atom: 133); that they are extensionless\npoints (Atom: 120); and that they are completely independent\nof one another, so that they cannot be connected to one another\n(Atom: 142). Now Fechner confronts the old conundrum which\ncaused so much trouble for Leibniz: How do unextended points give rise\nto the extended entities of experience? Fechner breezily dismisses the\nproblem. Extension does not arise from the atoms themselves but the\nrelationships between them; it is their aggregation which gives rise\nto their spatial appearance (Atom: 156\u2013157). But this\nquick solution still did not explain how spatial relationships could\narise from spaceless beings. \n7. Theory of Mind\n\nBeginning in Zend-Avesta Fechner set forth a theory of\nmind-body relations, which he then expounded in greater detail in his\nUeber die Seelenfrage and Elemente der Psychophysik.\nThis theory has been explained in great detail by Michael Heidelberger\n(2004: 73\u2013115), who regards it as Fechner\u2019s most important\ncontribution to philosophy. There is no necessary connection between\nthis theory and Fechner\u2019s panpsychism: the theory could be true\neven if human minds where the only minds in the universe; panpsychism\nis more about the extent rather than the nature of mind.\n\nFechner\u2019s theory begins with a distinction between two\nstandpoints, two ways of observing or knowing a human being. There is\nan internal and external standpoint, corresponding to which there are\ntwo kinds of appearances of a human being, internal and external\nappearances. An internal appearance is how I appear to myself or\nself-appearance; an external appearance is how I appear to\nothers. There are two kinds of knowledge corresponding to each kind of\nappearance. We know ourselves as minds immediately, i.e., intuitively\nor directly and without the need to make an inference; but we know\nothers mediately, i.e., intellectually or indirectly, through\ninferences we make from certain signs, viz., actions or words.\n\nThe main point that Fechner makes about these standpoints is that\ntheir appearances belong to one and the same thing. There are not two\ndistinct entities, a mind corresponding to internal appearances and a\nbody corresponding to external appearances; rather, there is one and\nthe same thing that appears inwardly to myself and outwardly to\nothers. \u201cInwardly it appears to itself thus; and outwardly it\nappears thus; but what appears is one and the same\u201d\n(ZA: 253). Hence Fechner\u2019s theory has been described as\na \u201ctwo aspect theory\u201d of the self. \n\nThis is the simplest formulation of the theory. It becomes more\ncomplicated, however, when Fechner adds other claims to it. The most\nstriking of these claims is that the mind and body are nothing but\ntheir appearances. The mind is nothing but its (actual and possible)\nappearances to itself; and the body is nothing but its (actual and\npossible) appearances to others. There is no mind in itself beyond how\nit appears to itself; and there is no body in itself, apart from and\nprior to how it appears to others. The theory then is a form of\n\u201cneutral monism\u201d, according to which there is one and the\nsame kind of thing which has two aspects or attributes depending on\nhow it is\n viewed.[14]\n This thing consists in only its appearances, whether internal or\nexternal.\n\nAnother claim that Fechner adds to his theory is that the two\nappearances are connected to one another in a causal or law-like way\n(see 1861: 211 and ZA: 253). Hence he says explicitly that\nthey are in a relation of interchange (Wechselbedingheit),\nthat they are intimately connected with one another (solidarisch\nzusammenhangen) (1861: 211). This is notable because some dual\naspect theories exclude the possibility of any interaction between the\nmental and physical appearances precisely because they are such\ndifferent kinds of attribute. Spinoza, for example, forbade any causal\ninteraction between the mental and physical because they were such\ndifferent kinds of attribute of substance (Spinoza 1677: Pars Prima,\nPropositio VI & X). Fechner saw the interaction as problematic, as\ndifficult to explain, but he did not forbid its possibility. Despite\nall the differences between mental and physical characteristics, he\nassumed that they referred to distinct events which, somehow, could\ninteract. The whole purpose of his Psychophysik was to\nexplain the interaction between them. \n\nStill another puzzling claim added to Fechner\u2019s theory is what\nhe calls \u201cthe most universal law of psychophysics\u201d: that\nnothing exists, originates or acts in the mind without something\nexisting, originating or acting in the body; in other words,\neverything mental has its expression in the physical (1861: 211). This\nprinciple seems to bias the connection between mind and body, so that\nthe mind appears as the body but not conversely; but the theory\noriginally called for a reciprocal connection or interaction\nbetween mind and body (as we have just seen above).\n\nIt is on the basis of this universal law that Fechner\u2019s theory\nhas been described as \u201cmaterialist\u201d (Heidelberger 2004:\n98, 107). This is an odd description, though, because the law seems to\npostulate that the mind has an efficacy on the body rather than the\nconversely. Materialist theories are often epiphenomenal, allowing the\ncausal direction to move only from the body to the mind. But\nFechner\u2019s law seems to say the opposite. \n\nWe will leave aside, for reasons of space, further complications in\nFechner\u2019s theory. To avoid serious confusion, though, it is\nnecessary to consider, if only briefly, the origins of the\n theory.[15]\n Fechner himself stated that his theory had its roots in\nSchelling\u2019s Naturphilosophie (Atom: xiv).\nThere is a certain plausibility to Fechner\u2019s genealogy. In the\nearly 1800s Schelling had developed his own dual aspect theory of the\nmind and body, according to which the mental and physical, the ideal\nand the real, are two equal and independent appearances of the\nabsolute. We need not cast doubt on Fechner\u2019s genealogy. The\ninitial impetus for his dual aspect theory might indeed have\nbeen Schelling; perhaps, if he had not read Schelling, he would never\nhave suggested a dual aspect theory. Still, it is important to see\nthat Fechner developed his theory along lines completely different\nfrom Schelling\u2019s. It was a fundamental principle of\nSchelling\u2019s theory that the mental and physical are one and the\nsame because they are different manifestations or appearances of\nliving force; the mental is the highest organization and development\nof that force, the physical is its lowest organization and\ndevelopment. His theory therefore rested upon the dynamic theory of\nmatter central to his Naturphilosophie. But Fechner, as we\nhave seen, rejected this theory, which was in conflict with his\natomism. Furthermore, Schelling, like Spinoza, forbade the possibility\nof interaction between the mental and physical, the very possibility\nthat Fechner wanted to investigate (Schelling 1859: I/4, 344). \n",
