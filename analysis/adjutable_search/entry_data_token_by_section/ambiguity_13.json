    "main_text": "Detecting Ambiguity || Ellipsis\n4.2 Ellipsis\n\nEllipsis tests work in a manner similar to conjunction reduction\ntests. For example:\n\nI saw his duck and swallow under the table and I saw hers too.\n(Zwicky and Sadock 1975)\n\n\n(55) can mean that I saw their birds under the table or that I saw\ntheir activities of ducking and swallowing but it can\u2019t mean\nthat I saw one\u2019s birds and the other\u2019s activities. Similar\nfeatures hold for structural ambiguities:\n\nI\u2019m happy that every man met two women and Jim is too.\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t possible to interpret (56) as having \u2018every\nman\u2019 with wide scope in one but narrow in the other. This\nsuggests a real ambiguity in the scope of the two quantifiers. This\ntest has led people some philosophers to surprising results. For\nexample, Atlas (1989) argues that the acceptability of the following\nsuggest that negation does not interact scopally with descriptions in\nthe ways we have come to expect:\n\nJohn thinks that the King of France is not bald and Bob thinks so\ntoo.\n\n\nThe purported availability of both readings suggests that sentences\nwith negation(s) and descriptions are sense-general rather than\nambiguous, contradicting many standard assumptions about the\navailable truth conditions these structures should make available. Alternatively, it may lead us to\nthink that there weren\u2019t as many readings as we initially\nthought there were (or that we have the wrong theory of\ndescriptions).\n",
