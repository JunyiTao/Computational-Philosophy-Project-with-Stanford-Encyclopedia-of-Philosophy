    "main_text": "Conditions for Receiving Evidence: What Counts as Evidence in Law? || Materiality and Facts-in-issue\n2.2 Materiality and Facts-in-issue\n\nWe have just considered the first condition of receivability, namely,\nrelevance. That fact A is relevant to fact B is not\nsufficient to make evidence of fact A receivable in court. In\naddition, B must be a \u201cmaterial\u201d fact. The\nmateriality of facts in a particular case is determined by the law\napplicable to that case. In a criminal prosecution, it depends on the\nlaw which defines the offence with which the accused is charged and at\na civil trial, the law which sets out the elements of the legal claim\nthat is being brought against the defendant (Wigmore 1983a,\n15\u201319; Montrose 1954: 536\u2013537).\n\nImagine that the accused is prosecuted for the crime of rape and the\nalleged victim\u2019s behaviour (fact A) increases the\nprobability that she had consented to have sexual intercourse with the\naccused (fact B). On the probabilistic theory of relevance\nthat we have considered, A is relevant to B. Now\nsuppose that the alleged victim is a minor. Under criminal law, it\ndoes not matter whether she had consented to the sexual intercourse.\nIf B is of no legal consequence, the court will not allow\nevidence of A to be adduced for the purpose of proving\nB: the most obvious reason is that it is a waste of time to\nreceive the evidence.\n\nNot all material facts are necessarily in dispute. Suppose the\nplaintiff sues the defendant for breach of contract. Under the law of\ncontract, to succeed in this action, the plaintiff must prove the\nfollowing three elements: that there was a contract between the\nparties, that the defendant was in breach of the contract, and that\nthe plaintiff had suffered loss as a result of that breach. The\ndefendant may concede that there was a contract and that he was in\nbreach of it but deny that the plaintiff had suffered any loss as a\nresult of that breach. In such a situation, only the last of the\nmaterial facts is disputed. Following Stephen\u2019s terminology, a\ndisputed material fact is called a \u201cfact in issue\u201d\n(Stephen 1872: 9).\n\nThe law does not allow evidence to be adduced to prove facts that are\nimmaterial. Whether evidence may be adduced to prove a material fact\nmay depend on whether the material fact is disputed; for\ninstance, the requirement that it must be disputed\nexists under Rule 210 of the Evidence Code of California but not\nRule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence in the United States.\n\u201cRelevance\u201d is often used in the broader sense that\nencompasses the concepts under discussion. Evidence is sometimes\ndescribed as \u201cirrelevant\u201d not for the reason that no\nlogical inference can be drawn to the proposition that is sought to be\nproved (in our example, A is strictly speaking relevant to\nB) but because that proposition is not material or not\ndisputed (in our example, B is not\n material).[10]\n This broader usage of the term \u201crelevance\u201d, though\notherwise quite harmless, does not promote conceptual clarity because\nit runs together different concepts (see James 1941: 690\u2013691;\nTrautman 1952: 386; Montrose 1954: 537).\n",
