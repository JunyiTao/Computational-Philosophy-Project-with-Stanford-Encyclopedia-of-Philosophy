    "main_text": "Plato\u2019s myths\n2. Plato\u2019s myths\n\nThere are in Plato identifiable traditional myths, such as the story\nof Gyges (Republic 359d\u2013360b), the myth of Phaethon\n(Timaeus 22c7) or that of the Amazons (Laws 804e4).\nSometimes he modifies them, to a greater or lesser extent, while other\ntimes he combines them\u2014this is the case, for instance, of the\nNoble Lie (Republic 414b\u2013415d), which is a combination\nof the Cadmeian myth of autochthony and the Hesiodic myth of ages.\nThere are also in Plato myths that are his own, such as the myth of Er\n(Republic 621b8) or the myth of Atlantis (Timaeus\n26e4). Many of the myths Plato invented feature characters and motifs\ntaken from traditional mythology (such as the Isles of the Blessed or\nthe judgment after death), and sometimes it is difficult to\ndistinguish his own mythological motifs from the traditional ones. The\nmajority of the myths he invents preface or follow a philosophical\nargument: the Gorgias myth (523a\u2013527a), the myth of the\nandrogyne (Symposium 189d\u2013193d), the Phaedo\nmyth (107c\u2013115a), the myth of Er (Republic\n614a\u2013621d), the myth of the winged soul (Phaedrus\n246a\u2013249d), the myth of Theuth (Phaedrus\n274c\u2013275e), the cosmological myth of the Statesman\n(268\u2013274e), the Atlantis myth (Timaeus 21e\u201326d,\nCritias), the Laws myth (903b\u2013905b).\n\nPlato refers sometimes to the myths he uses, whether traditional or\nhis own, as muthoi (for an overview of all the loci\nwhere the word muthos occurs in Plato see Brisson 1998\n(141ff.)). However, muthos is not an exclusive label. For\ninstance: the myth of Theuth in the Phaedrus (274c1) is\ncalled an ako\u0113 (a \u201cthing heard\u201d,\n\u201creport\u201d, \u201cstory\u201d); the myth of Cronus is\ncalled a ph\u0113m\u0113 (\u201coracle\u201d,\n\u201ctradition\u201d, \u201crumour\u201d) in the Laws\n(713c2) and a muthos in the Statesman (272d5, 274e1,\n275b1); and the myth of Boreas at the beginning of the\nPhaedrus is called both mutholog\u0113ma (229c5) and\nlogos (d2).\n\nThe myths Plato invents, as well as the traditional myths he uses, are\nnarratives that are non-falsifiable, for they depict particular\nbeings, deeds, places or events that are beyond our experience: the\ngods, the daemons, the heroes, the life of soul after death, the\ndistant past, etc. Myths are also fantastical, but they are not\ninherently irrational and they are not targeted at the irrational\nparts of the soul. Kahn (1996, 66\u20137) argues that between\nPlato\u2019s \u201cotherworldly vision\u201d and \u201cthe values\nof Greek society in the fifth and fourth centuries BC\u201d was a\n\u201cradical discrepancy\u201d. In that society, Plato\u2019s\nmetaphysical vision seemed \u201calmost grotesquely out of\nplace\u201d. This discrepancy, claims Kahn, \u201cis one explanation\nfor Plato\u2019s use of myth: myth provides the necessary literary\ndistancing that permits Plato to articulate his\nout\u2013of\u2013place vision of meaning and truth.\u201d\n\nThe discussion of the Symposium ends with Aristophanes and\nAgathon falling asleep while Socrates is trying to prove that\n\u201cthe skilful tragic dramatist should also be a comic poet\u201d\n(223d). Plato himself seems to be such an author, as some of his\ndialogues read like tragedies (e.g. the Phaedo), while others\nmix arguments with irony and humour (e.g. the Euthydemus,\nLesser Hippias, or Ion). For the link between drama\nand philosophy in Plato\u2019s dialogues see Puchner (2010), Folch\n(2015), Zimmermann (2018), and Fossheim, Songe-M\u00f8ller and\n\u00c5gotnes (2019); for the importance of comedy and laughter in the\ndialogues see Tanner (2017) and Naas (2018b); and for the theory and\npractice of narrative in Plato see Halliwell (2009). And now to go\nback to Kahn\u2019s claim (see the above paragraph) that in Plato\n\u201cmyth provides the necessary literary distancing that permits\nPlato to articulate his out\u2013of\u2013place vision of meaning and\ntruth.\u201d This may well be the case. But we have to keep in mind\nthat Plato\u2019s dialogues are a mix of various literary genres\n(philosophy, comedy, tragedy, poetry, mythology, rhetoric), and that\nthis mix is also (to use Kahn\u2019s expression)\nout-of-place. In other words, both the content and the\nform of Plato\u2019s dialogues were, and still are, rather\nextraordinary\u2014and that, I reckon, was meant to free his readers\nfrom conventions and encourage them to think for themselves about the\nissues that, he, Plato, discusses in his dialogues.\n\nThe Cave, the narrative that occurs in the Republic\n(514a\u2013517a), is a fantastical story, but it does not deal\nexplicitly with the beyond (the distant past, life after death etc.),\nand is thus different from the traditional myths Plato uses and the\nmyths he invents. Strictly speaking, the Cave is an analogy, not a\nmyth. Also in the Republic, Socrates says that until\nphilosophers take control of a city \u201cthe politeia whose story we\nare telling in words (muthologein) will not achieve its\nfulfillment in practice\u201d (501e2\u20135; translated by Rowe\n(1999, 268)). The construction of the ideal city may be called a\n\u201cmyth\u201d in the sense that it depicts an imaginary polis\n(cf. 420c2: \u201cWe imagine the happy state\u201d). In the\nPhaedrus (237a9, 241e8) the word muthos is used to\nname \u201cthe rhetorical exercise which Socrates carries out\u201d\n(Brisson 1998, 144), but this seems to be a loose usage of the\nword.\n\nMost (2012) argues that there are eight main features of the Platonic\nmyth. (a) Myths are a monologue, which those listening do not\ninterrupt; (b) they are told by an older speaker to younger listeners;\n(c) they \u201cgo back to older, explicitly indicated or implied,\nreal or fictional oral sources\u201d (17); (d) they cannot be\nempirically verified; (e) their authority derive from tradition, and\n\u201cfor this reason they are not subject to rational examination by\nthe audience\u201d (18); (f) they have a psychologic effect:\npleasure, or a motivating impulse to perform an action \u201ccapable\nof surpassing any form of rational persuasion\u201d (18); (g) they\nare descriptive or narrative; (h) they precede or follow a dialectical\nexposition. Most acknowledges that these eight features are not\ncompletely uncontroversial, and that there are occasional exceptions;\nbut applied flexibly, they allow us to establish a corpus of at least\nfourteen Platonic myths in the Phaedo, Gorgias,\nProtagoras, Meno, Phaedrus,\nSymposium, Republic X, Statesman,\nTimaeus, Critias and Laws IV. The first\nseven features \u201care thoroughly typical of the traditional myths\nwhich were found in the oral culture of ancient Greece and which Plato\nhimself often describes and indeed vigorously criticizes\u201d\n(19).\n\nDorion (2012) argues that the Oracle story in Plato\u2019s\nApology has all these eight features of the Platonic myth\ndiscussed by Most (2012). Dorion concludes that the Oracle story is\nnot only a Platonic fiction, but also a Platonic myth, more\nspecifically: a myth of origin. Who invented the examination of the\nopinions of others by the means of elenchus? Aristotle (see\nSophistical Refutations 172a30\u201335 and Rhetoric\n1354a3\u20137) thought that the practice of refutation is, as Dorion\nputs it, \u201clost in the mists of time and that it is hence vain to\nseek an exact origin of it\u201d (433). Plato, however, attempts to\nconvince us that the dialectical elenchus \u201cwere a form\nof argumentation that Socrates began to practice spontaneously as soon\nas he learned of the Oracle\u201d (433); thus, Plato confers to it a\ndivine origin; in the Charmides he does the same when he\nmakes Socrates say that he learned an incantation (a metaphor for the\nelenchus) from Zalmoxis; see also the Philebus 16c\n(on Socrates mythologikos see also Miller (2011)).\n\nWe have a comprehensive book about the people of Plato: Nails (2002);\nnow we also have one about the animals of Plato: Bell and Naas (2015).\nAnyone interested in myth, metaphor, and on how people and animals are\nintertwined in Plato would be rewarded by consulting it. Here is a\nquotation from the editors\u2019 introduction, \u201cPlato\u2019s\nMenagerie\u201d:\n\nAnimal images, examples, analogies, myths, or fables are used in\nalmost every one of Plato\u2019s dialogues to help characterize,\ndelimit, and define many of the dialogues\u2019 most important\nfigures and themes. They are used to portray not just Socrates\n[compared to a gadfly, horse, swan, snake, stork, fawn, and torpedo\nray] but many other characters in the dialogues, from the wolfish\nThrasymachus of the Republic to the venerable racehorse\nParmenides of the Parmenides. Even more, animals are used\nthroughout the dialogues to develop some of Plato\u2019s most\nimportant political or philosophical ideas. [\u2026] By our\nreckoning, there is but a single dialogue (the Crito) that\ndoes not contain any obvious reference to animals, while most\ndialogues have many. What is more, throughout Plato\u2019s dialogues\nthe activity or enterprise of philosophy itself is often compared to a\nhunt, where the interlocutors are the hunters and the object of the\ndialogue\u2019s search\u2014ideas of justice, beauty, courage,\npiety, or friendship\u2014their elusive animal prey.
