Finally, because the ingredients are\ngenuinely basic entities in the sense required to ground a rational\ncosmology in the Eleatic sense, they must be stable natures in the\nParmenidean sense (for a related account, see Marmodoro\n2015). Anaxagoras is committed to the arguments that ground Eleatic\nmetaphysics; thus he can claim an a priori reason to think\nthat the ingredients can be knowable in the sense required by the\nPrinciple of Predominance.  His epistemological view that humans can\nreach understanding through beginning with sense experience then fits\nwith these metaphysical commitments.\n4. Science: The Anaxagorean Cosmos\n\n\nAnaxagoras gave a complete account of the universe: of the heavens,\nthe earth, and geological and meteorological phenomena. The accounts\nof the action of nous and the original rotation and its\nconsequences appear in the fragments: B9 describes the force and\nvelocity of the rotation, B12 and 13 explain the beginning of the\nrotation and the subsequent breaking up and remixing of the mass of\ningredients, while B15 and 16 specify the cosmological consequences of\nthe continued rotation (Curd 2007 and 2008, Graham 2006, Gregory\n2007). Most of the other information comes from the testimonia, but\nthere is enough in the remaining fragments to make it clear that\neverything is ultimately explained by the great rotation set in motion\nby nous.  Further, and intriguingly, Anaxagoras claims that\nthe cosmic rotary motion could produce other worlds like our own.\n4.1 Cosmology\n\n\nThe rotation of the mixture begins in a small area, and then spreads\nout through the mass (B12). As the extent of the mixture is unlimited\n(or infinite, apeiron), the rotation and expansion will\ncontinue forever, bringing more and more ingredients into the whirl (a\nsummary of the process is in Gregory 2007). The force and speed of the\nrotation is (according to B9) much faster at the edges, where the\nexpanding rotation meets the as-yet-unmoved mass of ingredients: what\nwe perceive of the rotation (probably the motions of the heavens) is\nmuch slower than the unobserved rotation. The force is enough to pull\napart and rearrange the ingredients:\n\n\nWhen nous began to move [things], there was separation\noff from the multitude that was being moved, and whatever\nnous moved, all this was dissociated; and as things\nwere being moved and dissociated, the revolution made them dissociate\nmuch more. (B13)\n\n\nThere are two sorts of dissociation. First, as the rotation enters the\nas-yet-unmoved mass of ingredients, that mass begins to break up and\nthe ingredients start to shift in their concentrations. This causes\nthe original arrangement of ingredients to break up and begin to be\nrearranged. Because the mixture is a plenum, any separation is at the\nsame time a rearrangement of ingredients. Then, those new\nrearrangements are themselves subject to further break-up and further\nrearrangement. Anaxagoras indicates this in the fragments by using\ndifferent terms for different stages in the process (although he is\nnot completely consistent in these uses). Normally, he uses the notion\nof being separated off (forms of the verb apokrinesthai) for the\ninitial breaking apart of the mass. Re-arrangements are referred to as\nmixing (summisgesthai) or compacting\n(sump\u00eagnusthai). He also uses \u201cjoining\ntogether\u201d (proskrinesthai) as a contrast to the\nseparating off process (apokrinesthai) in B4a and B4b.  When,\nin B17, he claims that passing-away is really dissociation, he uses\nthe word diakrinesthai. This is a later stage than the\nearliest separations off of B1. The primary terms are compound forms\nof the verb krinein, to distinguish. The word can also mean\n\u201cto judge\u201d or \u201cto determine,\u201d and through the\nuse of these compound terms, Anaxagoras reminds his readers that all\nof the changes are ultimately traceable to the action of\nnous, or Mind, that sets the mass moving in the first\ninstance.\n\n\nOver time, the rotation throws lighter ingredients towards the edges\nof the whirl and pushes the heavier ones to the center (B15), thus\nputting more dark and heavy ingredients like earth in the center and\nthrowing air and aether (fire) away from the center. This gives the\ntraditional Greek picture of our Earth (itself a mixture of all\ningredients, with earth and heavy ores and minerals predominating)\ncovered (in many places) by water, with air and the fiery reaches of\nthe heavens.\n\n\nThe sun is a mass of fiery metal, and the moon is an earthy lump\n(with no light of its own). The same rotation ultimately produces\nthe stars and planets as well. Sometimes the force of the\nrotation snatches up stones from the surface of the Earth and spins\nthem around the Earth as they gradually rise higher through the force\nof the rotation. Until these bodies are high enough, they remain\nunseen between the Earth and the moon and so sometimes intervene to\nprevent heavenly bodies from being seen by terrestrial observers.\nThe force and shaking of the rotation can cause slippage, and so\nsometimes a star (a flaming mass of rock and iron) is thrown downwards\ntoward the earth as a meteor (such as the one Anaxagoras is supposed to\nhave predicted at Aegospotami; see Galzerano 2019). The fullest account of\nAnaxagoras\u2019 view on meteors can be found in Plutarch\u2019s\nLife of Lysander 12 (59 A12). Anaxagoras is also credited\nwith discovering the causes of eclipses \u2014 the interposition of\nanother body between earth and the sun or the moon: sometimes he\ncredits this to the \u201cunseen bodies\u201d mentioned above (see\nGraham and Hintz, 2007, Graham 2013a and 2013b, Taub 2003). According\nto the ancient sources (see esp. A1 and A42), Anaxagoras also gave\nexplanations for the light of the Milky Way, the formation of comets,\nthe inclination of the heavens, the solstices, and the composition of\nthe moon and stars.\n4.2 Meteorology and Geology\n\n\nThe rotation begun by nous ultimately affects phenomena\non the earth and above the surface of the earth. Anaxagoras claims\nthat the earth is flat, rests on air, and remains where it is because\nof its size (A42; a number of geological and meteorological views\nattributed to Anaxagoras were also apparently held by Anaximenes;\nwhether this is because Anaxagoras was following Anaximenes or because\nthe commentators conflate the two is unclear). Despite the manner of\nits formation, the earth is stationary, not spinning. The (relative)\nflatness of the earth allows water to spread over the earth, with\nmountains and plains rising above the level of the water. The levels\nchange as water is evaporated or added by rain, and as water that has\nbeen trapped in the earth by the rotation makes its way out through\nrivers to the sea. Because the air under the earth is also moving\n(pushed along by the cosmic rotation), it sometimes gets caught up in\nthe crevices of the earthy stuff. When this air cannot make its way\nout, the force of the moving air causes earthquakes. Anaxagoras seems\ndetermined to explain everything. The extant sources report views on\nthunder and lightning, the source of the Nile, the first correct\naccount of the nature of hail, and inquiry into why the sea is\nsalty. He also offered accounts of sense perception and made\ninquiries into embryology.\n4.3 Other Worlds?\n\n\nOne of the more curious aspects of Anaxagoras\u2019 theory is hinted\nat in B4a:\n\n\nSince these things are so, it is right to think that there are many\ndifferent things present in everything that is being combined, and\nseeds of all things, having all sorts of forms, colors, and flavors,\nand that humans and also the other animals were compounded, as many as\nhave soul. Also that there are cities that have been constructed\nby humans and works made, just as with us, and that there are a sun and\na moon and other heavenly bodies for them, just as with us, and the\nearth grows many different things for them, the most valuable of which\nthey gather together into their household and use. I have said\nthis about the separation off, because there would be separation off\nnot only for us but also elsewhere.\n\n\nWhere is the \u201celsewhere\u201d where there would also be\nseparation off, and where there are sun and moon \u201cfor them, just\nas with us\u201d? Surprisingly, no ancient sources discuss this\n(although Simplicius, who quotes the fragment, is clearly puzzled by\nit, and argues for a neo-Platonic metaphysical interpretation). Modern\ncommentators have suggested that the other worlds are on the moon\nand/or other planets (J\u00f6hrens 1939, Zeller 1923), elsewhere on\nthe face of our Earth (Cornford, 1934), or even contained within\nourselves (and all other things) so that there are infinite worlds\nwithin worlds (Mansfeld 1980, Schofield 1996, Sisko 2003). There is\nalso the possibility that Anaxagoras has no commitment to the reality\nof these other worlds, but is simply engaging in a thought experiment\nto show how the rotation would work (Fr\u00e4nkel 1969, Vlastos 1975,\nSchofield 1996).  There may be another possibility (Curd 2007). The\nunlimited rotation begins in a small area and expands indefinitely,\npulling more and more of the unlimited mass of as-yet-unmixed\ningredients into the whirl. Such an action could produce smaller local\nrotations within the larger whirl (especially at the expanding edges,\nas in the rotations of hurricane winds) and there, too, separation,\nmixture, and dissociation would occur. Such processes would result in\nthe formation of systems like our own. This is not a\nthought-experiment on Anaxagoras\u2019 part, but a commitment to the\nlaw-likeness of the rotations controlled by\nnous, and an awareness that similar processes will\nproduce similar phenomena.  Our world-system is not unique in the\nuniverse, although there is but one universe (constituted by the\nentire limitless mass of ingredients).\n5. Knowledge\n\n\nBoth ancient and modern critics have complained that Anaxagoras is\nunclear about the nature of nous (Mind/Intelligence) and its\nrole in his theory (Laks 1993, 2002; Lesher 1995). In B12 Anaxagoras\nclaims that\nnous has all discernment, and that nous \u201cknew\nthem all: the things that are being mixed together, the things that\nare being separated off, and the things that are being\ndissociated.\u201d Further, Anaxagoras remarks that there is\nnous in many things, and that it is alike in all the\nthings that it is in, both large and small (presumably those with\nsoul, i.e., living things). Aristotle says that Anaxagoras conflates\nsoul and mind, and B12 seems to confirm this, insofar as Anaxagoras\nthere treats nous primarily as a mover, yet also says\nthat it controls all things that have soul. It seems likely that in\nthings other than cosmic nous, those compacted or\nmixed-together natural constructs that have soul, the powers of\nnous include both knowing and perceiving. Nowhere do we have\nan analysis of the process of thinking for Anaxagoras, and although\nAristotle and Theophrastus say that earlier thinkers identified\nthinking and sense perception, there is little evidence for this view\nin Anaxagoras (Laks 1999, Warren 2007).\n\n\nIt seems clear that if nous is to have all discernment and\nto order the cosmos, it must have some knowledge of the contents of the\noriginal mixture (Lesher 1995, Curd 2004). Further, if the\ningredients are fundamentally real things they must have stable and\nknowable natures. (This follows from Parmenides\u2019 arguments\nabout the connection between what-is and what is knowable.) Thus,\nthere is a match between the natures of the ingredients and the\ncognitive power of cosmic nous, but Anaxagoras leaves the\nmechanism unexplained. It seems likely that cosmic nous\njust has a direct intellectual grasp of these nature and acts in\naccordance with that knowledge.\n5.1 Mind in Us\n\n\nOnly a few fragments and testimonia discuss Anaxagoras\u2019\nviews on perception and knowledge in living things. Aristotle and\nTheophrastus give us some account of his theory of perception, saying,\nmost surprisingly, that for Anaxagoras all sensation is accompanied by\ndiscomfort or pain (A92). Theophrastus links this to\nAnaxagoras\u2019 belief that like is perceived by unlike; on\nTheophrastus\u2019 view, perception is via touch, and unlike things\nproduce some irritation when touched. Theophrastus adduces loud noises\nand very bright light as producers of pain in perceivers, and suggests\nthat the mechanism is the same in all cases of sensation. Some\nirritation will be below the level of awareness for most perceivers,\nwhich is why humans do not normally feel pain when\nperceiving (see Warren 2007 for a good discussion of Anaxagoras on perception).\n\n\nWhat is the relation between perception and knowledge?\nAnaxagoras does not claim that perception alone is sufficient for\nknowing; nor does he seem to embrace skepticism. Sextus\nEmpiricus, always on the lookout for arguments for and against any\ndogmatic position, gives us most of the evidence for Anaxagoras\u2019\nviews. Says Sextus, of the skeptic\u2019s methodology, \u201cWe\nset what is thought in opposition to what appears, as Anaxagoras set\nthe appearance that snow is white in opposition to the claim that snow\nis frozen water, water is black, and therefore snow is black\u201d\n(A97; but see the passage from Cicero in the same testimonium).\nHere Anaxagoras accepts that snow seems to us to be white, but claims\nthat the reality must be that snow is black. The evidence of the\nsenses must be corrected by what we know through thought. In B21,\nAnaxagoras recognizes the weakness of the senses (\u201cOwing to\nfeebleness [of the senses], we are not able to determine the\ntruth\u201d), but in B21a he accepts that sense perception can be a\nstep towards understanding: \u201cappearances are a sight of the\nunseen.\u201d This follows from his own theory, for the evidence\nof our own control of our bodies by our minds, the facts of nutrition\nand growth, and the local revolutions of the heavens are evidence for\nthe workings of cosmic nous, the No-Becoming principle, and\nthe great cosmic revolution. Like other Presocratics, Anaxagoras\nleaves us with no detailed account of how knowledge derives from\nperception through the refinements of thought: Anaxagoras\u2019\naccount can be compared with that of Democritus, where the relation of\nsense-perception and thought is similar and similarly unexplained.\n6. Anaxagoras\u2019 Influence\n\n\nReportedly the first of the Presocratic philosophers to settle\nin Athens, Anaxagoras was a significant figure, not only for later\nphilosophical thinkers, but also for the wider civic culture of his\ntime. He was clearly an important influence on Pericles.\nPlutarch reports:\n\n\nBut Anaxagoras of Clazomenae was the one who most associated with\nPericles and who most bestowed on him that dignity and wisdom more\nweighty than demagoguery, and on the whole raised up and exalted the\nworthiness of his character \u2026These are not the only advantages\nthat Pericles enjoyed because of his connection with Anaxagoras. It\nseems that Pericles rose above superstition, that attitude of\nastonishment about celestial occurrences which is produced in those\nwho are ignorant about the causes of things and who are crazed by\ndivinity and divine interventions because of their inexperience in\nthese areas. Natural philosophy substitutes for festering superstition\nthat unshaken piety that is attended by good hopes. (A15,\nA16)\n\n\nThat naturalism appears in the dramas of Euripides, who is often\ndescribed as a pupil of Anaxagoras, and in the comedies of\nAristophanes, who satirizes the views of Anaxagoras as well as the\nfigure of Socrates in Clouds. Anaxagoras\u2019 theory\nof the floods of the Nile was known to Herodotus (and may be referred\nto in Aeschylus). Despite stories that they did not get along,\nthere are signs of influence of Anaxagoras on Democritus (in his\naccounts of perception and knowledge) and Anaxagoras\u2019 scientific\nclaims and discoveries affected all the thinkers of his time.\nOnce his views about meteors, hail, and eclipses became known, such\ntopics were always included in scientific accounts of astronomical and\nmeteorological phenomena. In the testimonia, Anaxagoras\u2019\neven temperament was taken as a model of good behavior, and he was\nfamous as a prognosticator of everything from meteor falls to rain\nshowers. \n\n\nAnaxagoras\u2019 views appear among Socrates\u2019 survey of\nprevious naturalistic theories of explanation (Phaedo 96a6\nff.). More ominously, Meletus seems to have attributed Anaxagoras\u2019\nclaims about the earthy nature of the moon and stars to Socrates at his\ntrial (see Plato\u2019s Apology 26e7ff., 59 A35). Although\nAnaxagoras\u2019 alleged indictment for impiety was probably as much political\nas a sign of his danger to public religion (attacking Anaxagoras was an\nindirect attack on Pericles), he was seen as important and influential\nenough to qualify to some as an enemy of the polis.\n\n\nPhilosophically, Anaxagoras\u2019 theories were also widely known and\ninfluential. Some scholars have thought that the author of the Derveni\nPapyrus (found in Northern Greece) was familiar with Anaxagoras\u2019\ntheories (Betegh 2004; Kouremenos et al. 2006), and once he introduced\nMind as a cause, other thinkers followed him. Diogenes of Apollonia\nclaimed that air (as mind and god) directs all things. Zeno of Elea\n(perhaps) and Melissus (certainly) criticize his theory. Anaxagoras\u2019\nview that \u201ceach one is and was most manifestly those things of\nwhich there are the most in it\u201d (the principle of Predominance)\nis echoed in Plato\u2019s claims that sensible things acquire their\ncharacters and names from the Forms in which they participate\n(Phaedo 102a10 ff.). Plato even adopts Anaxagoras\u2019 language\nof sharing or participating in (see Furley 2002), and like Anaxagoras\u2019 nous,\nPlatonic forms are \u201cthemselves by themselves\u201d in being\nself-explanatory (see Herrmann, 2007). Aristotle, although impatient\nwith the gaps in Anaxagoras\u2019 account of nous, expresses\nadmiration for his recognition that mind has a role to play in guiding\nthe cosmos, and he treats Anaxagoras\u2019 explanation of eclipses as a\nmodel of scientific explanation.",
