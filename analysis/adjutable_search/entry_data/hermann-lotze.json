    "preamble": "\n\nRudolph Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) mediated the\ntransition from the exuberance of German idealism, in the first half\nof the nineteenth century, to the sober, scholarly and scientific\nethos that came to prevail in the second half. He adapted the notion\nof \u201cchief\u201d or defining problems in the philosophical\nsub-disciplines, inherited from Herbart, and brought opposing\napproaches to bear on them, in a quasi-systematic way, preparing the\nway for the modern textbook. A professor in a changing situation,\nmoving toward bureaucratic centralization in an encompassing national\nstate, he mostly restricted his attention to academic issues,\nappealing to his peers (but not the public) in the now rising\nprofessional journal (while maintaining a lively interest in things\nquotidian). Given the increasing amounts of data and the rising\nimportance of the burgeoning new disciplines, Lotze hoped to preserve\na special place for philosophy as a value-theoretic investigation.\nLotze\u2019s influence was far-reaching and not yet widely admitted\nor well understood. While he accidentally inspired numerous\nmaterialists (and was simultaneously claimed by the idealists), his\nstrong association with certain traditionalist preachers, on the one\nhand, and liberal theological movements, on the other, blunted his\ninterest for the philosophical revolutionaries of the twentieth\ncentury, while simultaneously preserving a continued line of\nsubterranean influence.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Brief Chronology\n\n1817, born 21 May at Bautzen, in Saxony\n1819, family moves to Zittau, near Bohemia. While attending the\nhumanistic Gymnasium [secondary school] there, Lotze pens a\nyouthful Romantic novel, Die Deutschen [The\nGermans]\n1834, begins university studies in medicine and philosophy at\nLeipzig and, while enrolled, makes the acquaintance of Fechner\n1837, Lotze\u2019s philosophy teacher, C. H. Wei\u00dfe\n(1801\u20131866) gives an academic address calling for greater\nattention to be paid to the philosophy of Kant\n1838, achieves dual degrees in medicine and philosophy from\nLeipzig\n1839, first practices, then teaches medicine at Leipzig\n1840, Lotze\u2019s Habilitationsschrift [second\ndissertation], De summis continuorum (on infinite series),\naccepted at Leipzig, and publication of his Gedichte\n[Poetry]\n1841, the first or \u201clesser\u201d Metaphysics\npublished\n1843, the first or \u201clesser\u201d Logic\npublished\n1844, becomes the successor to Herbart at G\u00f6ttingen\n1852, Medical Psychology published\n1854, Materialismusstreit [\u201cthe materialism\ncontroversy\u201d] at G\u00f6ttingen\n1857, Polemical Writings published, including his reply\nto the younger Fichte, and Lotze translates Sophocles\u2019\nAntigone into Latin\n1868, History of Aesthetics in Germany published\n1874, the second or \u201cgreater\u201d Logic\npublished\n1876, made Privy Counselor under Bismarck\u2019s\nReich\n1879, the second or \u201cgreater\u201d Metaphysics\npublished\n1880, accepts offer, conveyed by Zeller, to move to university at\nBerlin\n1881, dies 1 July in Berlin and, later, buried beside his wife in\nG\u00f6ttingen\n1882ff, dictata of his lectures on various subjects\npublished (the so-called \u201cGrundz\u00fcge\u201d)\n1885\u201391, an edition, in four volumes, of his Kleine\nSchriften [Lesser Writings] appears\n\n2. Preface: philosophy before modernism\n\nAfter modernism, philosophy changed. But the change was slow in coming\nand, well before the full impact of high modernism, Hermann Lotze\nreigned as the single most influential philosopher in Germany, perhaps\neven the world. Although almost completely unread today, his\nsubstantial body of work exemplifies the new academic philosophy\n(\u201cKathederphilosophie\u201d) that flourished between\nthe demise of the post-Kantian idealisms and the rise of scientific\nphilosophy proper; he is usually credited with assisting \u201cthe\nrejection of Hegel and Absolute Idealism within the bounds of academic\nphilosophy\u201d (Schn\u00e4delbach, 1984, p. 169). Although the time\nperiod under discussion is sometimes denominated by the phrase\n\u201cbetween idealism and positivism,\u201d it might be more\naccurate to describe it as a transitory stage between the various\nideological groupings of the post-Enlightenment (romanticism,\nmaterialism, et al.) and those diverging philosophical\nmovements that only emerged in modernism proper (logical analysis,\nphenomenology, etc.). Thus, as a prominent figure within an\nessentially transitional period, Lotze\u2019s long shadow was,\nperhaps, predestined to gradually fade from the scene.\n\nWere we unsympathetic, Lotze might be uncharitably (and falsely)\ncaricatured with the appellation \u201cBiedermeier,\u201d\nespecially if one took seriously the oft-repeated charge of\nmethodological eclecticism (implicit in the all-to-common adoption of\n\u201cideal-realism\u201d as an adequate descriptor of Lotze\u2019s\nproject). It is true that Lotze refused to give pride of place to any\nparticular method or theoretical approach. But this fact entails\nneither that Lotze himself possesses no particular method nor that he\ndraws no determinate theoretical conclusions. Lotze\u2019s actual\ntechnique involves, instead, a peculiar dialectic, one which while\nattempting to give consideration to each side of a seeming antinomy,\nresolves ultimately in favor for one side, albeit one which is\nfundamentally transformed. Moreover, Lotze\u2019s\napproach\u2014which takes place against the backdrop of significant\npolitical reaction and social revolution\u2014exhibits a striking\nmodernity in his patient discussions of competing approaches to\nvarious \u201cproblems,\u201d one that proceeds without regard to\ntheir source in physiology, psychology or philosophy of mind. (We\nwould do well to recall that it was precisely to such figures that the\ntask of distinguishing amongst the heady mixture of early\nnineteenth-century science and pseudo-science fell.) His seminal\ninterventions, according to one of his students, belong to \u201ca\nperiod of transition and uncertainty; much of the light which the\npreceding age thought it possessed has vanished and the new light has\nnot yet dawned\u201d (Merz, 1907\u201314, p. 493). Accordingly,\nLotze\u2019s work looks both forward and backward, anticipating both\nthe methods and the emphases of the new philosophical spirit while\nclinging, nonetheless, to certain key assumptions of the very romantic\nWeltanschauung (cf. Richards, 2002) that he helped\n(ultimately) to undo.\n\nIt would be useful to further note something else that might appear,\nat first glance, as purely trivial; this is the critical shift in tone\nand temper, from the prior hostile and polemical one, to one much more\ntentative and hesitant effected by Lotze:\n\nIn his reviews, criticisms, and polemical writings he is as dignified\nas Kant and Herbart had been; he is never impolite as Fichte and\nSchelling frequently were; nor does he fasten upon his opponents any\nstigma as Hegel frequently succeeded in doing; he is quite above that\nvirulent and unmannerly invective by which Schopenhauer tries to\ncrush, but never actually damages, the arguments of thinkers whom he\nchooses to regard as enemies. But the style of Lotze reflects one\ncharacteristic trait of modern thought. The confidence and\nself-assurance of Kant, Fichte, Hegel. Schopenhauer, and of the\nearlier Schelling have disappeared. (Merz, 1907\u201314, p. 493)\n\n\nThe new model of the academic researcher demands the replacement of\nprominent personalities\u2014i.e., romantic\n\u2018geniuses\u2019\u2014by the new exemplar of the sober\nscientist. Significant, as well, are the new material constraints on\nthe practice of philosophy: not just the rise of the university\nprofessor\u2014after Kant\u2014as the most prominent representative\nfigure, but the correlative emergence of the professional journal as\nthe typical venue of presentation and publication. Of course, the\natmosphere of political repression, following the failed revolutions\nof 1815 and 1848, surely played a crucial role in limiting the wider\nambitions of philosophers and reinforcing the need for a more neutral\ntenor. Indeed, the same political pressures and bureaucratic demands\nassociated with the state professor\u2019s status as \u201ccivil\nservant\u201d began to figure prominently during the first half of\nthe nineteenth century, harkening back to the Fichte\u2019s\ndifficulties in the Atheismusstreit (1798/99) and leading up\nto, among other things, the dismissal of the \u201cG\u00f6ttingen\nSeven\u201d (1837)\u2014just to enumerate a few salient events from\nthe German situation alone.\n\nThe efficient causes of this portentous change were not limited to the\nsocial-political sphere: in the numerous departments that came to make\nup the philosophical, or lower, faculty of the university, other\nimportant developments were also afoot. First, and foremost, there\nmust be numbered the emergence of new, separate disciplines\u2014such\nas geology, chemistry, biology and psychology\u2014and the resulting\nsquabbles over relative positions, proper boundaries, and the\nsubsequent agon of \u201crole purification\u201d (see\nKusch, 1995). In addition, the rapid advances in the scientific\ndiscovery had multiplied the previously manageable amounts of data\nand, hence, suggested to some that the task of philosophy was now to\nrestrict itself to explaining \u201chow the problems of speculation\nstill connect themselves with the ever increasing mass of special\nknowledge that the labours of the new generation have\naccumulated\u201d (Adamson, 1885b, p. 573). In this context, the\ncognate conceptions of philosophy as a synthesizing or supervisory\nendeavor began to gather adherents. Indeed, the \u201crehabilitation\nof philosophy\u201d [Rehabilitierung der Philosophie] (see\nSchn\u00e4delbach, 1984, pp. 103ff) is perhaps the central\nfoundational issue of the day and names \u201cthe attempt to allot to\nphilosophy, in a scientific age, a domain of problems that would be\nindependent of the special sciences\u201d (ibid., p. 103).\nHere, as elsewhere, Lotze emulates Fichte: while science can surely\nexplain what is, it can never elucidate the ultimate value or meaning\nof the phenomena it reveals\u2014that alone is the task of philosophy\n(cf. ibid., p. 178).\n\nOddly\u2014despite his one-time pre\u00ebminence\u2014Lotze founded\nno enduring school. However, his teaching directly influenced such\nprominent students as Windelband and Frege and his ideas were still\nbeing considered and debated as late as the 1920s by a numerous\nnotables, including Heidegger and Carnap. Even in his own day,\nLotze\u2019s reputation soon spread beyond the continent. As a\nresult, he became a substantial force in the English-speaking world\naffecting, among others, Green, Bradley, and Bosanquet, in Britain,\nand Royce, James, and Santayana, in America. Indeed, it is principally\nby this latter means that he came to hold some sway with both the\nearly Moore and the early Russell. Furthermore, because his influence\nextended through both Anglo-America and the Continent, some have\npostulated his unconscious but seminal presence in the emergence of\nanalytic philosophy (cf. Sluga, 1980, Gabriel, 2002, Milkov, 2000);\nand, likewise, studies of Lotze by historians of phenomenology\n(Rollinger, 2001, Hauser, 2003) have also begun to emerge.\n\nFinally, in this same moment, when philosophy was only beginning its\n(eventual and complete) confinement to the academy\u2014and becoming\nsimultaneously more specialized and less provincial\u2014Lotze was\n(notably) the darling of numerous Protestant theologians and\npreachers: both conservatives who sought to popularize him as a\nfanatical opponent of mid-century materialism, and others, of a more\nliberal character, who fastened on to his \u201cpersonalism\u201d as\nthe proper antidote to the dangerous heterodoxies of pantheism,\nrationalism, agnosticism and atheism (cf. Hall, 1912, pp. 94n-96n).\nWhile Lotze himself may not have endorsed these distortions, there\nwas, nonetheless, something about his work that permitted such misuse.\nSantayana, a keen observer of this very phenomena, insisted on\ninserting an important cautionary note: he remarked dryly that one\nought not to be misled by Lotze\u2019s continuous reference to\n\u201csouls\u201d or \u201cGod\u201d as \u201ca certain\nacceptance which Lotze has found in conservative circles is perhaps\ndue to insufficient considerations of his meaning\u201d:\n\nLotze is inclined to give old names to new things; he is fond of a\nmetaphysical nomenclature, and his terms are generally more mysterious\nand old-fashioned than his ideas. Thus he speaks of the soul, of\nsubstance, of free will, of efficient causation, of a personal God;\nbut these phrases stand in his system for comparatively modest and\nlegitimate conceptions. The words may please us in themselves; but we\nshall be disappointed if we welcome the things for love of the names\nthey bear. (Santayana, 1971, p. 153)\n\n\nIf correct, this suggests that Lotze, once again, followed the lead of\nFichte in using traditional language to mask more deeply naturalistic\nconceptions than the surface meaning of the ordinary wording might\ninitially suggest. (This peculiar feature of the expression of his\nthought must be made continually present by the active reader.) In any\nevent, Lotze\u2019s continuing influence in the twentieth century\n(ironically) came mostly through the theological curriculum of\nclassical liberal Protestantism, still in evidence until the\nlate-1960s (cf. Reardon, 1968).\n\nAlthough it is tempting to regard the Post-Enlightenment period as a\nconfused interregnum, serving only as a prelude to the revolutionary\nbreakthroughs of philosophical modernism \u2013 that is, those\nmovements that organized and flourished after the Great War \u2013\nthe fact is that Lotze (and in particular the Logik) was\nstill a relevant and wholly viable topic for philosophical seminars\nwell into the 1920s. As a result, there is a related trend that augurs\nfor treating Lotze as if he were a contemporary and thus subjecting\nhim to our own expectations and standards. On those terms, however,\nLotze presents mostly an unappealing and enigmatic tangle.\n\nThe only viable way to proceed is to see him as consciously continuing\nto practice some of the sly deception and willful obfuscation of those\nEnlightenment thinkers still subject to vigorous state repression and\nsocial persecution. For this tack there are, of course, a grab bag of\ntechniques, on display in a wide variety of modern thought, that all\nresult in the same, highly desired end: plausible deniability. Without\ncultivating our own sensitivity to the highly provocative nature of\ncontroversies that to our minds may be considered settled, we cannot\nsee how Lotze attempts to subtly open up the minds of his readers to\nany number of heterodox possibilities.\n\nThe name naturally associated with this sort of inquiry is, of course,\nthat of Leo Strauss. Yet the work of his students invariably comes to\nan end with post-Enlightenment thinkers, terminating typically at the\nend of the Enlightenment, with \u201cRousseau, Lessing, and\nKant\u201d (Strauss, 1988, p. 33). But if we consider that a further\nline of repression runs from Fichte up to the widespread institutional\nsuccesses of the neo-Kantians, on the continent, and the British\nIdealists, elsewhere, then Lotze is situated squarely in this\ninterregnum. It thus seems natural to wonder if the state actions of\nthe sort noted above, when combined with the obvious sensitivities of\nthe university appointment process, may not have suggested to Lotze\nthat a certain circumspection and discretion might still provide the\noutlines of the best course of action. In a period of political\nreaction and repression, civil servants needed to proceed cautiously\n(compare Beiser, 2014, pp. 178ff).\n\nTo this purpose, the structure of the entry now takes the following\nform: first, an investigation of three controversies, addressed by\nLotze (that are, quite naturally, not controversies for us); second,\nan exposition of three contributions Lotze made to the academic\ndiscipline of philosophy, which are incorporated, sometimes as wholes,\nsometimes in parts, usually unacknowledged, by the modernist movements\nthat displaced him; and, finally, a discussion, naturally somewhat\nspeculative and incomplete, as to the ways that, faute de\nmieux, Lotze still exerts an underground influence on issues of\nsome undisputed currency. These I deem his \u201clegacies.\u201d\n\nNow that our own new century is well underway, [u]nderstanding and\nincorporating the insights and achievements of the twentieth century\nreturn us, perforce, to their roots in the prior century. But so long\nas the nineteenth century remains \u201cstill the most obscure of all\nthe centuries of the modern age up to now\u201d (Heidegger, 1977, pp.\n139\u2013140), even the true significance of our present endeavors\nmay remain yet unknown and unknowable to us. The only alternative is\nblank incomprehension, the sort already possible within about fifty\nyears of his death; for when Wittgenstein\u2019s student Drury\ncomplained about the inclusion of Lotze as a special author in the\nsecond part of his Tripos, Wittgenstein could only reply:\n\u201cProbably a man who shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to write\nphilosophy\u201d (Rhees, 1981, p. 121).\n3. Three Controversies\n3.1 Polygenesis\n\nA good example of the twists and turns intrinsic to Lotze\u2019s\ndialectic may be illustrated by a brief excursus on his treatment of\nthe \u201cproblem\u201d of \u201crace.\u201d (On this topic, the\nfirst question that might occur to contemporary readers concerns the\nproper domain and ultimate provenance of this \u201cproblem\u201d:\nis it biological, anthropological, sociological or political? does it\nname a theoretical or a practical difficulty?) Although often\ntorturous, these passages provide a sometimes unique insight into the\nmonogenesis-polygenesis debate in the post-Enlightenment. Lotze begins\nhis discussion quite skeptically, averring that the \u201cmuch\ndiscussed problem of the specific unity or diversity of the whole\nhuman race cannot as yet be definitely solved\u201d and he heartily\ncommends this attitude as \u201cthe impression of unprejudiced\npeople\u201d (Micro, I, p. 506). He immediately follows this\nadmonition, however, with a lengthy list of cogent reasons for\nmonogenesis, noting that \u201cin the varieties of the human race\n\u2026 the differences are not so excessive as to render impossible\na historical derivation from a single source\u201d:\n\nIt is true that no race of men possesses any physiologically important\norgan denied to another race; in none is the normal number of multiple\nparts, such as teeth or fingers, different from what it is in another;\nno single joint of the skeleton, no muscular layer, is formed or\nsituated on different plans in different races; all are formed erect,\nall capable of speech; to all physiological processes are assigned on\na common plan; in the duration of life, of pregnancy, in the\nattainment of puberty, along with numerous fluctuations to which, as\nregards each of these points, the human race is liable, there are no\nconstant differences of time distinguishing one race from another. The\nactual differences are varieties in the proportion of size of the\nparts of the body, and more especially in the form and colour of the\nexternal coverings. Assuredly, if Nature had not made the Negro black,\nthe Indian red, the rest of the organisation of these races (whatever\nmight have been the case with the analysis-loving naturalist) would\nnever have suggested to the imagination of men in general any reason\nfor treating them as distinct species, and excluding them from an\norigin common to all \u2026 Finally, let us add that the different\nraces can be propagated by crossing, and as the result of all, it will\nappear that these varieties of the human race are connected together\nby the closest analogy of physical formation (Micro, I, pp.\n508\u2013509).\n\n\nLotze next goes on to consider but reject the very old idea that these\nsuperficial changes (size and color) have been effected by variations\nin such environmental factors as habitat or climate. In this\nsupposition, Lotze believes that the central difficulty for all such\ninvestigations in this area is an inevitable but nonetheless unsavory\ndependence upon \u201cuncertain causes of which we can form no\nconception\u201d (Micro, I, p. 514). Consequently,\n\u201cthe hypothesis of the original unity of the human race cannot\nbe absolutely disproved\u201d (ibid.). The choice between monogenesis\nand polygenesis remains squarely at the level of scientific conjecture\nand no one can determine a priori which hypothesis to rule\nout. What we would prefer is a reliance upon \u201cthe actual facts\nfor which we have the evidence of the senses\u201d (Micro,\nI, p. 524). But even a brief consideration of this data forces upon us\nthe realization that we have, at our disposal, a very small collection\nindeed.\n\nLotze\u2019s seeming indifference and impartiality regarding these\ncompeting hypotheses masks his real and over-arching interests, namely\nestablishing that: (1) much of this debate is actually rooted in\nlogical errors and linguistic difficulties, and (2) value-theoretic\nconclusions are simply not derivable from either scientific theory or\nfact. First, errors arise in the logic of the very process of\nclassification (Micro, I, p. 507) and, then, the very choices\nof terminology\u2014kind, variety, species, genus, etc.\u2014are\nopen to logical or linguistic manipulation completely unconnected from\nthe question at hand, namely \u201cwhether they can all have actually\nsprung from one and the same primitive stock by generation and\nclimactic influences\u201d (Micro, I, p. 522). Second, such\nmere manipulations are not facts and, furthermore, even were strong\nempirical evidence available, it would not provide the upshot its\nproponents suppose. To show this, Lotze constructs the following\ngruesome and impossibly racist scenario:\n\nSupposing it could be proved by irrefragable evidence that the\nancestors of the Negroes were really true undoubted apes, but at the\nsame time the fact remained that the present Negroes walk erect,\nspeak, think, and in general possess the degree of intelligence (be it\ngreat or small) which we know from experience they do\u2014what moral\nexcuse could there be for the cruelty of accommodating the treatment\nof them not to what they are, but to what their ancestors were,\nor\u2014to speak logically\u2014to the kind or species to which by\ntheir descent they belong? (Micro, I, p. 524).\n\n\nWhen we recall that racism was often clothed in the respectability of\nbeing scientific and \u201cup to date,\u201d we can discern\nLotze\u2019s canny move in blocking any ethical conclusion\nbeing derived from seemingly scientific evidence. (And when we recall\nthe subtitle of the Microcosmus \u2013 \u201cattempt at an\nanthropology [Versuch einer Anthropologie]\u201d \u2013\nLotze\u2019s actual motives begin to shine through.)\n\nUltimately, this is part and parcel of Lotze\u2019s overarching\nstrategy of driving a wedge between scientific fact, on the one hand,\nand human significance, meaning and value, on the other: science, to\nwhich falls the task of describing what is, can never provide\nus with the ultimate meaning of or reason behind\nwhat is. Lotze remained convinced that no value theory could be\nderived from science and that, yet, the teleological impulse was\nintrinsic to and irreplaceable in human existence. On more than one\noccasion, he avers to the following line of reasoning:\n\n\u2026 the contemplation of the whole series of graded periods\nduring which formless matter may have been undergoing processes of\nformation would but add to the splendour and variety of the scenes in\nwhose outward pomp our admiring phantasy might revel, but it would not\nexplain the wondrous drama as a whole more adequately than the modest\nbelief which sees nothing but the immediate creative will of God from\nwhich the races of living beings can have been derived\n(Micro, I, p. 527).\n\n\nThe varieties of human beings\u2014should we choose to cast that in\nthe terminology of race or not\u2014appears to be the expression of\nsome formative principle [Bildungstrieb], one whose meaning\nand purpose can never be exhausted by the technical complexity of the\nstory we may adduce about the process of that formation. (For another\ndiscussion along similar lines see Appiah, 2014, pp. 94\u201398).\n3.2 Panpsychism\n\nPanpsychism is widely taken to provide a possible answer to the\nmind-body problem and the by now (merely repetitive) reiteration of\nLotze\u2019s commitment to panpsychism is easy to document. The fact that\nLotze said praiseworthy things about his former teacher, Fechner,\nafter the latter\u2019s mental breakdown, is usually highlighted and we\nare informed that \u201cLotze\u2019s main criticism of Fechner is that\nhe is not bold enough \u2026 there were deeper metaphysical reasons\nfor thinking that all reality is alive\u201d (Beiser, 2013, p. 235).\nBut this approach forces us to take Lotze\u2019s equivocal statements at\nface value when there are numerous clear indications that we should\nnot.\n\nFirst of all, almost all of the quotations typically drawn from the\nMikrokosmus in support of panpsychism are actually phrased in\nthe form of questions (and not assertions), viz.\n\nIf we cannot account for the appearance of a mental state\n[geistigen Zustandes] by those properties in virtue of which\nwe call matter matter, what hinders us from supposing that besides\nthose properties there is a store of inner life which usually escapes\nour attention, and finds no other opportunity of manifestation than in\nwhat we call mental life [geistiges Lebens]? (Micro,\nI, p. 150)\n\n\nWhy, in opposition to matter as an ever dead substance, should all\nmental activity [geistiges Regsamkeit] be condensed into the\nspecial nature of a soul [Seele], destitute on its side of\nthe properties by means of which the physical elements make themselves\nof account in Nature? (ibid.)\n\n\nMight not the visible substance have directly a double life, appearing\noutwardly as matter, and as such manifesting no property other than\nthose mechanical ones with which we are familiar, \u2013 internally\non the other hand moved mentally [geistig bewegt], aware of\nthe changes in its states, and accompanying with efforts the activity,\nwhose general subjection to law it is certainly not in its power\narbitrarily to alter? (ibid.)\n\n\nHave things by their motions, while themselves destitute of enjoyment,\nonly to minister to souls [Seelen] as mere stimuli to this\nmental life [innerlichen Leben]? (Micro, I, p. 353)\n\n\nHas the one half of creation, that which we comprise under the name of\nthe material world, no function whatever save that of serving the\nother half, the realm of mind [des Reiches des Geister], and\nare we justified in longing to find the lustre of sense\n[Sinnlichkeit] in that also whence we seem always to derive\nit? (ibid.)\n\n\nIn the Mikrokosmus, Lotze emphasizes that panpsychism is\nstrongly motivated from the impetus to counter, in some fashion, the\nexcesses of materialism. But this very \u201cjustification,\u201d he\ncomments, is simultaneously \u201cthe source of the barrenness of\nthis view\u201d (Micro, I, p. 151): we don\u2019t like\nmaterialism, so we appeal to panpsychism, adopting the\ncounter-hypothesis that simply \u201cascribes to matter a secret\nmental life\u201d (ibid.). But why in the world ought we do that?\n\nAt best, panpsychism, under this pretext, is merely an empty and vain\nidea, \u201ca conception \u2026 that, [may be counted] among the\ndreams of our imagination\u201d; it names a belief about which the\nmost we may say is that it \u201cmay be one of those which do not\ncontradict actual facts\u201d (Micro, I, p. 360). In a word, it\nis possible, but scarcely probable and in no wise to be considered\nactual. After all, were it quite literally to be true, then we would\nhave to adjust ourselves to the following curious state of affairs:\n\u201cWho could endure the thought that in the dust trodden by our\nfeet, in the prosaic texture of the cloth that forms our clothing, in\nthe materials shaped into all sorts of utensils \u2026 there is\neverywhere present the fulness of animated life \u2026?\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 361). Who could truly inhabit such a ghastly\nand ghostly realm?\n\nConsequently, neither science nor philosophy has any need of such an\nhypothesis, one that indeed bears an uncanny relation to mythological\nthinking (remnants of which are still preserved in our culture,\nthrough the influence of Greek art and thought). Nonetheless, whatever\nits storied pedigree, \u201cwe \u2026 must not introduce it into\nscience.\u201d From the sole requirements of knowledge alone,\n\u201cnothing remains for us but to gather from experience the laws\nfound valid in the ultimate ramifications of reality\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 363). Among our philosophical inheritance from\nGerman Romanticism, thus, cannot be counted \u201cSchiller\u2019s\nG\u00f6tter Griechenlands\u201d (Micro, I, p. xiv) and\nthe like.\n\nNor can we, in any fashion, seek to derive this view from purely\nself-interested metaphysical motives, viz.\n\nThe dislike to look on one part of the cosmos as but a blind and\nlifeless instrument for the ends of another, the desire to diffuse\nover all the joy of animation, and to vindicate a universe enjoying at\nevery point throughout its own existence a more perfect than one in\nwhich a divided structure shows mentality [des Geistigen]\nabove an unconscious basis \u2013 in this we have but one series of\nmotives inviting us beneath the unruffled surface of matter behind the\nrigid and regular repetitions of its workings, to seek the warmth of\nmental activity [geistigen Regsamkeit] (Micro, I, p.\n362).\n\n\nIn a word, fear of nihilism is also no justification. Indeed, at long\nlast, the only rationale that can be offered for the panpsychist\n\u201cwager\u201d is purely aesthetic in nature: \u201cnothing but\nthe beauty of the living form is made to us more intelligible by this\nhypothesis\u201d (Micro, I, p. 366). Indeed, in the end, we\nmay only admit that our scientific work \u201cneither wants nor needs\npanpsychism \u2013 rather, it is needed to satisfy the human spirit,\nto make the nature of soul comprehensible\u201d (Skrbina, 2007, p.\n128).\n\nAt first glance, however, this explanation superficially suggests that\nLotze may be nothing more than a beautiful soul. Panpsychism must, at\nbottom, be shown to possess some truly special significance, far\noutstripping the utterly false assistance it would pretend to offer to\nthe natural sciences. For assisting the science of psychology, even\nthe very possibility of panpsychism is \u201cwholly immaterial\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 365). Rather, Lotze asserts, to be painfully\nrepetitive, that \u201cnothing but the beauty of the living form\n[die Sch\u00f6nheit der lebendigen Gestalt] is made to us more\nintelligible by this hypothesis\u201d (Micro, I, p. 366).\nBut what, precisely, could this gnomic utterance be taken to mean?\n\nIt appears that Lotze\u2019s terminology cashes out directly as follows:\n\u201cThe image which we now have to form of the living form [die\nlebendige Gestalt] and its mental life is that of an association\nof many beings\u201d (Micro, I, p. 367). Lotze then extends\nthe figure by analogizing each human individual to our species\nbeing:\n\nAll that we prize in life, and that is the source of nobler\nenjoyments, rests on this mode of combination in a manifold; the human\nrace, embodies in countless individuals, leads the life of constant\nreciprocal action, of mutual fellow-feeling in love and hatred, of\nuninterrupted progress, that make all share in the gain of one part\n(Micro, I, p. 368).\n\n\nBut this does not entail any submerging of the many into some one:\n\u201cThe unity in which we long to be knit with another is always\ncompleteness of intercourse, reciprocal enjoyment of what is without,\nnever the confused mingling in which all joy of union perishes\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nConsequently, as applied to each unique individual, we must admit that\nontogeny really does recapitulate phylogeny, by admitting that\n\u201c\u2026 its inner life never becomes ours and when the union\nof different beings on which our living form [unsere lebendige\nGestalt] depends falls to pieces, while we shall all have gone\nthrough something together, it will be as beings originally different\nthat after a passing contact again separate\u201d (ibid.).\n\nPanpsychism emerges hence as an aesthetic hypothesis that can be\ncalled on to account for one thing and one thing only: the realization\nforced earlier in the century by the French physiologists that life,\nwhatever it was, was a union of separate and quite heterogeneous\nprocesses, held together in the most fragile of unions:\n\nBichat\u2019s physiological conclusions grew primarily out of his\nstudy of death, in which we identified death as a fragmented process,\nconsisting of the extinction of different organs and processes: the\ndeath of locomotion, of respiration, of sense perceptions, of the\nbrain. If death was thus a multiple, dispersed event, then so was\norganic life. According to Georges Canguilhem, \u201cThe genius of\nBichat was to decentralize the notion of life, to incarnate it in the\nparts of organisms.\u201d With Bichat begins the progressive\nparcelization and division of the body into separate and specific\nsystems and functions that would occur in the first half of the\nnineteenth century (Crary, 1992, pp. 78\u201379).\n\n\nEach of us is then, quite literally, composed of others, who, while\ncoming together for a time, to work upon a common purpose, ultimately\ndisperse, returning to a more basic (and decomposed) form of\nexistence. That is the ultimate and, indeed, the only point of the\npanpsychist perspective: we may view our individual being on analogy\nwith the cooperative workings of multiple entities, as in a larger\nsociety. Society is simultaneously an image of the self, and vice\nversa.\n\nNow Lotze did his best to sugar coat this physiological revelation but\nnot, it seems, in order to make it more palatable; instead he wanted\nto show, simultaneously, how little we have gained and how little we\nhave lost in its acknowledgement. In reality, the best gloss of\nLotze\u2019s overarching strategy \u2013 as wrested from its original\npoint of reference \u2013 is that \u201c\u2026 Lotze takes his\nreader to the abyss only to pull him back and teach him a lesson. The\nexercise in metaphysical brinkmanship is designed to show the reader\nthat the only salvation from nihilism, the only way forward in\nmetaphysics, lies in ethics \u2026\u201d (Beiser, 2013, p.\n155).\n\nScience has given and science has taken away. But, in reality, nothing\nhas changed. What matters is how we look at it. The nihilistic\nconclusions of the natural sciences can\u2019t change (or undermine\nthe truth of) human experience, no matter how deep our investigation\ndescends. Our situation is thus akin to that given admirable (if\nsomewhat dated meteorological) literary expression as follows:\n\nA barometric low hung over the Atlantic. It moved eastward toward a\nhigh-pressure area over Russia without as yet showing any inclination\nto bypass this high in a northerly direction. The isotherms and\nisotheres were functioning as they should. The air temperature was\nappropriate relative to the annual mean temperature and to the\naperiodic monthly fluctuations of the temperature. The rising and\nsetting of the sun, the moon, the phases of the moon, of Venus, of the\nrings of Saturn, and many other significant phenomena were all in\naccordance with the forecasts in the astronomical yearbooks. The water\nvapor in the air was at its maximal state of tension, while the\nhumidity was minimal. In a word that characterizes the facts fairly\naccurately, even if it is a bit old-fashioned: It was a fine day in\nAugust 1913 (Musil 1930\u20131945 [1965], p. 3).\n\n\nThe poetic and the evaluative may appear resolutely old-fashioned in a\ncold, utilitarian universe. But it names precisely an impulse of human\nknowers that can never be replaced, supplanted or repressed.\nPractically speaking, we are value-finding beings. We will continue to\nutter such strange and human constructions as \u201cthe sun is coming\nup\u201d or \u201cit was a very fine day,\u201d for our world is both poetry\nand prose. And it can never be simply one or the other for human\nexistence.\n3.3 Vitalism\n\nAs highlighted in the chronology, Lotze officially began as a student\nof medicine and, after attaining the doctorate in philosophy, he\nquickly followed with a degree in medicine, awarded for his\ndissertation De futurae biologiae principibus philosophicis\n(1838). There later commenced other medically-oriented works,\nincluding his Allgemeine Pathologie und Therapie als mechanische\nNaturwissenschaften (1st: 1842, 2nd: 1848), Allgemeine\nPhysiologie des K\u00f6rperlichen Lebens (1851), and\nMedicinische Psychologie, oder Physiologie der Seele (1852).\nLotze\u2019s output\u2014in and around the\nV\u00f6rmarz\u2014betrays a continuing preoccupation with\nboth the theory and application of the biological sciences in\nmedicine, physiology and psychology. But it is within this same time\nperiod that Lotze makes a fateful contribution, one later portrayed,\nby Lange, as his \u201cinvoluntary service to materialism.\u201d (Of\ncourse, from similar premises, Lotze drew sharply different\nconclusions than the materialistic thinkers he inadvertently\ninspired.) This \u201cservice\u201d was his trenchant attack on the\nconcept of \u201cvital force\u201d [Lebenskraft], widely\nheld, by a variety of thinkers of differing orientations, to have\nstruck the decisive blow (cf. Gregory, 1977, pp. 131f).\n\nLotze\u2019s medical dissertation was, under one description, his\nopening salvo in this attack, for in it he advocated the abandonment\nof key concepts of Naturphilosophie including, inter\nalia, \u201cpolarity\u201d and \u201cvital oscillation\u201d\n(cf. Woodward & Pester, 1994, p. 167 and Pester, 1997, p. 58). But\nhis targets also included the diagnostic terminology favored by the\nmedical nosology of the day\u2014most prominently,\n\u201casthenia\u201d (and its cognate notions) and, as already\nmentioned, \u201cvital force.\u201d While the former was a\ncontribution of the Brunonian theory, further elaborated in Germany by\nnumerous (and peculiar) enthusiasts, the latter was a more widespread\nassumption of biological thought generally speaking. Yet despite such\nimportant differences, both might be pegged with the same fundamental\nflaw: both could be characterized as empty \u201cabstractions\u201d\nthat falsely paraded as causally \u201cexplanatory\u201d notions.\nPut in Kantian terms, they were both treated (wrongly) as though they\nwere truly \u201cconstitutive\u201d principles of human\ncognition.\n\nTeleology, and teleological notions generally, while licit for certain\nheuristic purposes, pace Kant, cannot be raised to the level\nof cognitive principle. Hence, while enquiries into the biological\nrealm may safely assume purposive function, as a necessary theoretical\nposit, such assumptions may serve only as regulative\u2014not\nconstitutive\u2014principles in biological thought. Teleological\nnotions, such as \u2018order\u2019 and \u2018purpose\u2019, are,\nas necessary presuppositions of our theorization generally,\nineliminable. But such notions cannot be used explanatorily or, more\nprecisely, in a way that effectively precludes further investigation\ninto the actual causes of organic phenomena. In other words, from the\nperspective of scientific explanation itself, vital force has no role\nto play. Furthermore, philosophy itself always outstrips science and\nindicates \u201cthe need to go beyond what is already known and given\nin the direction of something as yet unknown and not given\u201d\n(Schn\u00e4delbach, 1984, p. 172).\n\nThe basic Kantian insight was further ramified by Lotze: mechanism and\nteleology are coexisting, compatible modes of explanation, each with\ntheir own proper sphere, and not contradictory opposites:\n\u201c[b]oth \u2026 are limited, and both imply one another.\nMechanism is therefore no power controlling reality, but rather the\nway in which a purposeful reality realizes itself\u201d (Robins,\n1900, p. 11). A lazy reliance on hypothetical posits, Lotze suspected,\nmerely betrays our unwillingness to engage in the difficult work of\nreal scientific discovery. Furthermore by \u201cmechanism\u201d\nLotze meant not a blind naturalistic or reductionist technique;\nrather, he used this word to signify a hypothetical-deductive method\nof explanation of phenomena (cf. Woodward & Pester, 1994, p. 165).\nThis has important ramifications for the emerging biological sciences:\nif the essence of science lies in the employ of the\nhypothetical-deductive method of explanation\u2014and not\nmathematization, as Kant had insisted\u2014then biology and medicine,\nfor instance, both might admit of a rigorous treatment worthy of the\nname \u2018science\u2019. Teleology does not replace explanation: it\nsupplements it (cf. Lenoir, 1982, pp. 168ff).\n\nHowever, materialists such as Czolbe were inspired by the elimination\nof vital force to continue metaphysical \u201chouse-cleaning\u201d\ninto the remaining parts of the super-sensual. But Lotze saw no\nconnection between the rightful rejection of empty, and hence,\nun-scientific notions, on the one hand, and respectable, metaphysical\nconcepts proper, on the other. And so, he believed it possible to be a\nphysiologist, investigating the brain and the nervous system, and a\nmetaphysician, of the soul, simultaneously. There is only one clear\nand consistent view in natural science: that of hypothetical-deductive\nphysical science. Within this framework, the notion of vital force is,\nas already noted, dispensable, replaceable by physico-chemical\nexplanations. This substitution had no effect, however, on the\nmetaphysical concepts of necessity, finality and purpose, which must\nboth be part of and govern any (proper) investigation. Materialism was\nthus forestalled, from Lotze\u2019s perspective, by his overriding\ncommitment to a value-theoretic teleology.\n\nWith this proviso firmly in mind, one would have to admit that a\nproperly scientific account could never rule out the existence of such\nthing as a \u201csoul.\u201d And yet traditional philosophical\nexplanations, rooted in the spontaneity of thought, in practical\nreason, or in the freedom of the will, argued Lotze, cannot suffice to\nestablish this \u201cuniversal prejudice.\u201d Nor may we rest\ncontent with the obvious fact that deductive explanations seem\nirrelevant when it comes to understanding mental life generally. There\nis, nonetheless, a \u201cdecisive fact of experience\u201d which may\nserve to legitimate this posit: the unity of consciousness\n(Micro, I, p. 152). But it is not our perception of unity\n(consciousness) that underwrites this ulterior unity (the soul).\nRather, \u201cour belief in the soul\u2019s unity rests not on our\nappearing to ourselves as a unity, but in our being able to appear to\nourselves at all\u201d (Micro, I, p. 157). As Lotze further\ndetails his (transcendental) argument: \u201cWe did not conclude that\nthe soul is one, because we appear to ourselves as a unity; but\n\u2026 by the fact that anything can appear to us\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 163). This, teleology is further supplemented\nby Kantian-style arguments which may further rebuff positivist\nimpulses to construe philosophical investigations as superfluous.\nPerhaps, for this reason, Lotze\u2019s views are sometimes\ncategorized under the very title that he, on occasion, used:\n\u201cteleological idealism\u201d (cf. Wagner, 1987, p. 75 &\nSchn\u00e4delbach, 1984, p. 177). Further, because Lotze comes to see\nnature itself as comprehensible as the life of a cosmic\nindividual\u2014or God\u2014the unity of consciousness is part and\nparcel of the ultimate unity of the very cosmos itself (cf. Santayana,\n1971, pp. 211ff).\n4. Three Contributions\n4.1 Intuition\n\nThe Lotzean soul functions as \u201ca genuine stable point\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 143); thus, as a substantial and\nself-determining principle of unity in consciousness, it is the\nfunctional equivalent of Kant\u2019s \u201ctranscendental unity of\napperception.\u201d The soul is, further, \u201cthe abiding source\nof sensation [i.e., cognition], of feeling [i.e., of emotion], of\neffort [i.e., volition]\u201d (Micro, I, p. 184). But it is\nalso, Lotze emphasized in contradistinction to Kant, always a\nparticular, embodied consciousness, living entwined in concrete and\nmanifold relatedness. And, even more importantly, it is equally\ncharacterized by its innate capacities for emotion and volition, and\nnot just cognition: the soul encompasses all of the capacities of\nhuman consciousness and is not restricted to merely intellectual\nfunctions. Further, the soul is insofar as it lives (cf.\nOutMet, pp. 43\u201344). (Indeed, one interpreter goes as\nfar as to suggest that Lotze embraced a\n\u201cphenomenological\u201d\u2014rather than a traditional\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d\u2014notion of the soul, citing the\nstriking utterance: \u201cInsofern ist der Name der Seele ein\nphaenomologischer Ausdruck\u201d (cf. Sachs-Hombach, 1993, p.\n256).) But that there is such a soul is an undeniable conviction\ninspired by the only credible apprehension of human selfhood and\nagency.\n\nThe Lotzean standpoint was created both to appeal to certain\nHerbartian emphases and to contrast sharply with others, for Herbart\nhad modeled the soul (in part) on a Leibnizian monad: for him, it was\na single, simple, independent, unchanging, indestructible substance.\nAs such, it is utterly analogous to the one thing that, qua substance,\nunderlies the many, shifting properties, which it bears. Such\n\u201creals,\u201d which are absolutely simple, can, nonetheless,\nenter into causal relationships with other \u201creals\u201d (be\nthey souls or not). Hence, complex mental processes and psychological\nproperties are constructed on the basis of the properties and\nrelations of those \u201creals\u201d we may identify as souls. (As\nshall soon become apparent, this conception is utterly abhorrent to\nLotze, who embraces in its place, something that, at first glance,\nappears to be a form of phenomenalism, i.e., that to be a substance is\nnothing more than to appear as a substance.)\n\nA strong commitment to the concept of soul\u2014or mind or\nconsciousness as distinct from brain activity\u2014leads to a\nmetaphysical question about the very possibility of exact spatial\nlocality qua immaterial being. This, in turn, moves naturally to the\nprior epistemological issue of how the very perception of space is\npossible in the first place, given the essentially non-spatial\ncharacter of mental representations. As Lotze begins with the\nassumption that these representations are non-spatial, he must account\nfor how the soul can take the manifold of sensation and, subsequently,\nre-create the relative location of its elements in space. For if the\nbrain and the soul are indeed distinct, then no spatial configuration\nin the brain could account for our mental apprehension of spatiality.\nIndeed, an even more basic problem is to account for the way in which\n\u201cthe fixed situation of the variously stimulated nerve\nextremities\u201d becomes an object of consciousness at all\n(Micro, I, p. 307, cf. pp. 308\u2013309).\n\nSince spatial relations cannot proceed directly to consciousness,\nspatial localization is possible only if the non-spatial\nrepresentations are accompanied by \u201ca qualitative property of\nsome kind which the impression acquires \u2026 in virtue of the\npeculiar nature of the place at which it comes into contact with the\nbody\u201d (Micro, I, p. 309). Consciousness takes up this\naccompanying qualitative information, such that \u201cthey act as\nmarks or as local signs, under whose guidance it proceeds in spreading\nout the impressions into an image occupying space\u201d\n(ibid.). As one contemporary commentator observes: Lotze\ntheorized \u201ca close connection between the muscle sensation\nassociated with a sense organ and the local signs that accompany the\nsensations produced through stimulation of the sensory nerves of that\norgan\u201d conceived of as a \u201can innate anatomical\nmechanism\u201d (Hatfield, 1990, p. 160). This localization, Lotze\nbelieved, resulted from the \u201ccoloration\u201d produced not by\nany innate characteristics of the stimulated nerve but by the\nassociated motor impulses that will accompany stimulation of the nerve\n(cf. ibid.). It is only in such a way, Lotze contended, that\nnon-spatial perceptions can be reconstructed, in our intuition, into a\nspatial dimension (cf. Micro, II, p. 605). It is a matter of\nfurther discussion whether Lotze\u2019s theory of\nLokalzeichen accords best with contemporary (and competing)\nempiricist or nativist accounts (cf. Woodward, 1978).\n\nIn typical Lotzean fashion, the preceding discussion is held to be\nstrictly irrelevant in assessing the epistemic nature of spatial\nrepresentation. This stems, in part, as shall be discussed in the next\nsection, from the fact that Lotze insisted that mere stimuli\u2014and\ntheir concomitant relations of association\u2014do not, by\nthemselves, attain to the level of judgmental validity: the mental\nrepresentations which compose judgments proper are an accomplishment\nof the mind (consciousness, soul) alone. Hence, space is, as Kant had\nmaintained, epistemically ideal. In a rare, uncharacteristically\ncandid agreement, he admitted that \u201cthis kernel of Kant\u2019s\ndoctrine I accept unreservedly\u201d: \u201cspace and all spatial\nconnections are merely forms of our subjective intuition, not\napplicable to those things and those relations of things which are the\nefficient causes of all particular sensuous intuitions\u201d\n(Micro, II, pp. 603\u2013604). But Lotze affirmed this\npremises for reason quite different from Kant, for he believed that\nKant had rested his claim of \u201cthe ideality of space on the\nargument that the spatial form of the intuition must be innate\u201d\n(Hatfield, 1990, p. 163). While Lotze agreed that \u201c\u2026 it\nis not we who are in space, but it is space which is in us\u201d\n(OutRel, p. 53), this statement engenders no commitments\nabout the ultimate justification of intuitive statements.\n\nThe upshot of this approach is that not only does this remove\nconsiderations of spatiality from the noumenal realm, but also to\naccord a new epistemic status to intuition simpliciter: Lotze spoke as\nthough \u201cit is simply given to us in intuition (by inspection)\nthat between any two points only one straight line can be drawn; he\nreferred the \u2018first principles\u2019of geometry to the same\nbasis in intuition\u201d (Hatfield, 1990, p. 163). Hence, Lotze\ncounted the axioms of geometry as \u201cself-evident truths,\u201d\ntheir very self-evidence being grounded in their intuitive nature:\n\u201che conceived the role of intuition as that of revealing the\nself-evident\u201d (ibid.). This picture is further enriched\nwith Lotze\u2019s distinction of justification (logical) from genesis\n(psychological). On this view, psychological genesis (or the context\nof discovery) was irrelevant to the question of logical justification\n(or the context of justification). It is this approach that gives rise\nto an axiomatics, where the axioms were to be numbered among those\nthings identified as the self-evident truths. (However,\n\u201cself-evident,\u201d for Lotze, was often times invoked for an\naccomplishment of thought and, hence, not strictly identifiable with\nthe ordinary notion of the plainly \u201cobvious.\u201d)\n4.2 Thought\n\nAs the last section made clear, Lotze made important contributions to\nthe emerging project of neo-Kantian epistemology, including the new\nconcept of validity (as detached and detachable from questions of\npsychological origin). Further, in his Logic, Lotze included\nmuch that would normally be considered under the separate heading of\n\u2018epistemology\u2019. Yet Lotze resolutely refused the mantle of\n\u201cthe theory of knowledge\u201d for a simple but compelling\nreason: what went under that title in the 1850s and 1860s was a\npsycho-physiological investigation, for some early figures in the\nneo-Kantian revival (prominently, Helmholtz and Lange) construed the\nM\u00fcllerian doctrine of \u201cspecific nerve energies\u201d as\nproof positive of the Kantian emphasis on the contributions of\ntranscendental subjectivity in our apprehension of objects. Lotze\ncontinuously rebuffed such associations. If \u201ctheory of\nknowledge\u201d named a psychological investigation, then validity\nwould be subordinated to \u201cthe history of the psychological\ndevelopment of our thought\u201d (Phil, p. 467). But\npsychology was to be counted \u201clast\u201d and not\n\u201cfirst\u201d in epistemic priority and it \u201ccan never be\nthe foundation of our whole philosophy\u201d (ibid., p.\n468).\n\nAccordingly, many subsequent philosophers both recognized and credited\nLotze with helping to make some of the earliest forays against the\nlooming spectre of psychologism (cf. Heidegger, 2000, p. 29ff). Most\ncritical here is, perhaps, Lotze\u2019s act-content distinction (cf.\nMicro, II, 630), one which followed Herbart, but preceded\nBrentano by decades. Furthermore, concept-formation is conceived to be\na logical process over and above the mere psychological course of our\nideas (further discussed below). Also, Lotze clearly opposed the\npan-logicist deduction of Absolute Idealism with something\napproximating the regressive analysis favored by the subsequent\nneo-Kantians: \u201cthe more urgent and the greater work of\nphilosophy must, I think, bear the shape of a regressive investigation\nwhich seeks to discover and to fix securely what principle is to be\nrecognised and used as the living principle in the construction and\ncourse of the world\u201d (Phil, p. 452). Discovery of\ntruths of absolute and universal validity describes the a\npriori project Lotze first adumbrated, later embraced in the\nlogicist program of his student Frege and in varieties of\ntranscendentalism espoused by various neo-Kantians.\n\nAs just mentioned, concept-formation is freed from the peculiarities\nof the subjective psychological process by concentration on the\ncreation and refining of objective thought contents. This logical\nprocess may proceed by reference to the \u201cgrammatical\u201d\ncategories of substantive, adjective and verb that may be taken to\n\u201cmirror\u201d the logical categories of object, concept and\nrelation, respectively. As it has been explained, this picture allows\nfor both an act-content distinction and the minimal structure required\nto get our metaphysics off the ground:\n\nThe three logical forms thus indicate the minimum amount of structure\nwe must presuppose in order to come to any deeper understanding of\nreality. That is, one must minimally posit: (i) things, which serve as\n\u201cfixed points\u201d which may support and to which we may\nappend (ii) dependent properties, \u2026 which may connect or relate\nto other such \u201cfixed points\u201d by means of (iii) relations\n\u2026 [further] [b]y naming part of our sensory-manifold, we\nseparate out that part and make it a content which can be grasped by\nothers. (Sullivan, 1991, p. 260)\n\n\nIn this way, Lotze made headway and yet, ironically, appeared\nretrograde to those who came after, those who found little comfort in\nthe seeming correspondence of grammar and thought-contents.\nNevertheless Lotze\u2019s actual contributions to the emergence of\nSprachphilosophie are typically unappreciated, if not ignored\naltogether. This is strange for although, by mid-century, many\ndifferent theoretic approaches to the study of language were\navailable, Lotze is undoubtedly the most important of the mainstream\nacademic philosophers to turn his attention to this topic. In his\nMicrocosmus, Lotze devoted numerous pages to the connection\nhe hoped to help establish, that between language and thought. A\nnumber of his important consideration and conclusions will be\nsummarized and discussed in what follows. (For a further discussion of\nsome of these points, particularly in relation to Frege, see Sullivan,\n1991.)\n\nFirst, Lotze denies that language is primarily a phonemic enterprise,\ninsisting instead that there is a dual dependence between language and\nthought: language cannot exist without there being meanings\n[Bedeutungen] correlated to its words and yet thought also\nrelies directly upon the syntactic abilities of a given natural\nlanguage to provide the basic form by which apprehension may take\nplace. For this reason, language cannot be portrayed as emerging as a\nspecies of \u201cventing,\u201d designed only to communicate bodily\npassions and excite animal sympathies. Language too is an inadequate\nexpression of our thought and in our actual speech we omit much,\nrelying on the abilities of our hearers to reconstruct that which is\nnot explicitly expressed in words. Likewise, for effective\ncommunication, much is dependent upon such things as gestures,\nemphases, and other modulations of voice. But Lotze remained immovable\non his central motif: \u201cthe peculiar nature of thought and the\nvery close connection between it and language\u201d (Micro,\nI, 619).\n\nFor Lotze, the merely accidental associations of ideas do\nnot\u2014and cannot\u2014constitute thought. The animal mind is\ncapable of linking associations but it can neither explain nor justify\nthese perceived connections (for instance, on the basis of an\nobjectively valid law). Thought is dependent in its architectonic on a\ncertain process of formation to occur so that \u201cbuilding\u201d\ncan begin. As construction cannot begin with a mere \u201cpile of\nstones,\u201d there first must be a process of \u201ccutting and\nshaping\u201d so that the basic elements of thought may be properly\n\u201cfitted together,\u201d forming interlocking pieces:\n\u201cLanguage exhibits this first operation of thought in the\ndistinction of its parts of speech\u201d (Micro, I, p. 622)\nand the three forms of substantive, adjective, and verb compose\n\u201cthe minimum of organization and division of presented matter\nwith which thought can attempt to begin its operations\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 623). Furthermore, this syntactic organization\nis the very element that gives \u201csignificance\u201d to our\nwords:\n\nNow this is what we signified above as the peculiar function through\nwhich the significant sound really becomes a word; for it is not made\nsuch by its significance; on the contrary, the interjections which\nmost purely and directly express psychic excitement form an\nunorganized residue of the material of language. The sound becomes\na word by means of the logical accessory thoughts displayed in the\ncharacter of the parts of speech; they serve as uniting surfaces\nand joints for the various contents, which thus become capable of\nsyntactic combination in the service of thought (ibid., my\nemphases).\n\n\nThus, to reiterate again, the three linguistic forms of substantive,\nadjective, and verb are required to express thought\u2019s\napprehension of (independent) objects, (dependent) properties, and\nrelations (respectively). And for such formative purposes, syntax is\ncritical, not sound. This is because \u201cthought cannot directly\nmake use of sensations, feelings, moods, simple or complex images, as\nmaterials for its structure\u201d (Micro, I, p. 622).\n\nNevertheless, and despite the multiple riches of linguistic\nexpression, grammatical syntax often falls short of logical structure\n(\u201cmay lag behind its logical articulation\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 624)). Indeed, linguistic form is responsible\nboth for a certain superstition and a mythology being imported into\nhuman thinking. The first (superstition) occurs because the very\nprocess of naming seems to bestow a quality on reality that is, in\npoint of fact, quite possibly lacking:\n\nThe sound of the name seems to dispel \u2026 obscurity, though it\nadds nothing to the content\u2014does not even always bring the light\nimplied in indicating the particular place belonging to the object in\na series, or within the sphere of some wider notion. Young botanists\ndelight in learning the Latin names of wayside flowers, and go\ncontented on their way only to be presently disturbed by a mountain\nthat, strange to say, has no name, and so has properly speaking no\nright to be there. Now, what do they miss in the one case? What did\nthey gain in the other? I cannot look on this fancy as so\ninsignificant as it appears\u2014nay, I see in it a counterpart or\ncontinuation of the genuinely human mode of conception \u2026 We are\nnot satisfied with the perception of an object; its existence becomes\nlegitimate only when it forms part of a regular system of things that\nhas its own significance apart from our perception (Micro, I,\np. 627).\n\n\nAs a result, for Lotze, an arbitrarily given name is, in fact, no name\nat all: a mere \u201cname\u201d is utterly insufficient. What is\nrequired is for that name to provide \u201cevidence of its having\nbeen received into the world of the universally known and\nrecognised\u201d (Micro, I, p. 628). While remaining\nsomewhat obscure, it should now be apparent, as in the earlier remarks\nabout \u201crace,\u201d that the mere enumeration of terminology is\nsurely not sufficient for this larger requirement.\n\nWe go well beyond mere superstition into a full blown mythology,\nhowever, once we add in the fact that language has a history and,\nthus, has accumulated, over time, a large reserve of possible\nexpressions including those made possible by what Lotze dubs\n\u201cthe syntactic pliability of language\u201d (ibid.).\nConsequently, even utter nonsense can deceive us by means of the\nsurface correctness of its grammatical form. The prime candidates here\nare those expressions which emerge by means of the nominalization of\npredicates. For example,\n\n\u2026 we have almost ceased to speak of beautiful objects,\ni.e., we forget that what we call beautiful is\noriginally a mere adjective determination not existing apart from a\nsubject; we speak now of the Beautiful, or at best of\nBeauty, and our aesthetic thinkers are quite convinced that\nwhat can exist only as an attribute is correctly apprehended only when\nit has unnaturally been apprehended as something substantive which is\neverywhere identical (Micro, I, p. 629).\n\n\nIt thus appears that Lotze is among those figures who diagnosis\ncircumstances where logical form ought not to follow\n(\u201cmodel\u201d) grammatical syntax, despite the undeniable work\nthat grammar makes possible for thought:\n\nIn all \u2026 [such] cases language creates for us a mythology, from\nwhich, of course, in the use of language we can never wholly set\nourselves free without becoming pedantically precise, but against the\ninfluence of which on the moulding of our thoughts we ought to be\ncarefully on our guard. Logic does not always assist us in this\ndirection, nay, sometimes in its methods makes pernicious concessions\nto this false tendency arising from the use of language\n(Micro, I, p. 630).\n\n\nUnlike Frege, however, Lotze sees little prospect for a logic freed\nfrom the constraints of linguistic syntax. Further, because Lotze\nfigures mathematical logic as contiguous with the Leibnizian project\nof a lingua characteristica, his doubts about the latter\nextend to the former, which he dubs the \u201clogical\ncalculus.\u201d This new symbolism\u2014e.g., the Boolean expression\nof universal affirmative judgements with \u201cy =\nvx\u201d\u2014is only \u201can ineffectual indication of\nwhat we knew before\u201d (Log, p. 276). In his eyes, the\nLeibnizian project entailed the search for a logical language which\nwould provide \u201ca universal mode of characterizing\nconceptions\u201d (ibid., p. 272). But Lotze\u2019s\nepistemological holism focused on the judgement, and its ultimate\nderivation from a priori principles, rather than the analysis\nof conceptual content. Furthermore, as just mentioned, Lotze\u2019s\nanalysis of content may be easily exhausted in a quasi-grammatical\nanalysis and precludes, of course, a more complex construal involving,\nsay, quantification and other second-order functions. (It is important\nto note, however, his introduction of a functional notation for the\nanalysis of the relation of part-concepts.)\n\nNow despite his rejection of symbolic logic as an unfruitful and\nunnecessary novelty, Lotze nonetheless held fast to the existence of\n\u201cnecessary laws of thought\u201d as the strongest bulwark\nagainst relativistic skepticism. Indeed, the various kinds of\nskepticism, whatever there other differences, share a fatal flaw: they\nall must articulate a possible standard of truth and the very same\ntime that they deny or demur the actual existence of such truth.\nLikewise, objections that such laws have only \u201csubjective\nvalidity\u201d (i.e., are valid only for us) and, hence, inadequate\napproximations of the external world presuppose some realist thesis\n(about the nature and existence of the external world) that has not\nyet been established (cf. Foster, 1882, pp. 43ff). Accordingly, Lotze\nmust refuse the charms of any correspondence theory of truth and\nembrace, in their stead, a variant of the coherence theory. However,\nalthough coherence is a relation that is descriptive of ideal\nthought-contents, we must not expect that coherence entails the\npossibility of a completely coherent world-picture being graspable by\nany particular human knower. Hence, the laws of coherence are ideal\nlaws of thought and philosophy must disclaim all ambition of arriving\nat a consummate and perfect system.\n4.3 Existence\n\nOnce we abandon the project of further articulating relations between\nworld and idea, as adumbrated in the preceding section, however, we\nmight appear to be stymied by charges of vicious\n\u201ccircularity\u201d once we refuse to go outside the sphere of\nour own presentations. Lotze acknowledges this \u201ccircle\u201d\nbut deems it unavoidable:\n\nThe circle is inevitable, so we had better perpetrate it with out eyes\nopen; the first thing we have to do is to endeavour to establish what\nmeaning it is possible for us to attach to knowledge in its widest\nsense, and what sort of relation we can conceive to subsist between\nthe subject which knows, and the object of its knowledge, consistently\nwith those yet more general notions which determine the mode in which\nwe have to conceive the operation of anything whatever upon anything\nelse. What we have to do is to obtain the last-mentioned conception,\nwhich amounts to a metaphysical doctrine, and to treat the relation of\nsubject and object as subordinate to it. (Log., p. 451)\n\n\nWhat is needed, within logic, is to concern ourselves with the general\na priori structures of human cognition (for it is this\ninvestigation that leads one ineluctably to the existence of certain\ngeneral yet necessary truths, which must frame our entire\nepistemological enterprise). This transcendental project is, however,\nsubordinate to one constraint: a metaphysical system which can limit\nand constrain the realm of the possible which might make up our circle\nof ideas. Hence, we come ineluctably to the concept of being.\n\nAny post-Kantian discussion of the relation of thought to being must\ncome to grips with Kant\u2019s rigid bifurcation between phenomenal\nappearance and noumenal reality. Of course, without strict adherence\nto this distinction, Kant\u2019s own position would collapse into\nBerkleyan phenomenalism. Accordingly, post-Kantians such as Herbart,\nwho wanted to maintain a strong realism, had to rethink this central\nfeature of Kantian metaphysics. But while Herbart maintained the\npossibility of some relation between noumena and phenomena, Lotze went\nfurther in dissociating the two; hence, Lotze was led to oppose, as\nwell, the notion of a single unchangeable substance lying at the base\nof the thing and constituting its essence. Accordingly, phenomenal\nproperties, which say nothing about the true nature of a thing, say\neverything about our peculiar capacity of perception. Yet Lotze\nassumed that changes at the phenomenal level must reflect changes at\nthe noumenal and he persisted in the belief that although appearance\nis not like reality it does, nevertheless, provide knowledge of\nreality. And so, he mustered adherence to Herbart\u2019s realist\nstandpoint while rejecting all correlative claims about the\nimmutability of substance (cf. Santayana, 1971, pp. 152ff). Our only\nconclusion must be Santayana\u2019s: \u201c\u2026 although he\nretains the word substance he abandons the notion for which it\ncommonly stands\u201d (Santayana, 1971, p. 153). Hence, we might be\ntempted to see Lotze as inaugurating the reign of the\nFunktionsbegriff over the Substanzbegriff (cf.,\nCassirer, 1923).\n\nAdditionally, the notion of being favored by Kant (and his realistic\ndisciple Herbart) rested in the belief that the meaning of existence\nsimpliciter could by captured in the formulation\n\u201cabsolute position.\u201d As this standpoint has been\nencapsulated:\n\nThe Herbartian view is indicated in the notion of \u2018pure\nbeing\u2019 as Setzung: that \u2018what we call the true\nBeing should be found only in pure \u201cposition,\u201d void of\nrelation\u2019. In fact, on this view, it is only because pure being\nlacks relation that existing things are able to enter into relations\nat all. Herbart concludes that reality is composed of something\nplural, simple and indestructible: what he called \u2018the\nReals\u2019. Since reality is compounded of substances that can\nsuffer no change, and are hence immutable, the relations (into which\nthings \u2018enter in\u2019) must be utterly external and\naccidental. (Sullivan, 1998, p. 841)\n\n\nLotze rejects this portrayal of reality composed of simple\nunchangeable substances for, first, the concept of\n\u2018position\u2019 ascribed to them is meaningless in\nabstracto and, second, utterly dependent upon the correlative\nnotion of \u2018relation\u2019; conceptual relations are a creation\nof our thought, which stipulates a connection between otherwise\ndivergent individual things. Subsequently it has no more claim to\nreality than spatiality, for it too simply implicates a mere\nform of perception. Also, the na\u00efve conception of\nrelations as metaphysically primitive gives rise to numerous problems\nof infinite regress (cf. Robins, 1900, pp. 88\u201389). In its place,\nLotze substituted for this creation of pure thought a kind of\nlinguistic contextualism: instead of affirmation of a particular\nconcept, affirming, as an act, belongs to \u201cnothing but a\nproposition in which the content of the notion is brought into\nrelation with that of another\u201d (Micro, II, p. 582).\nNotably, the contrasting conceptual folly has a metaphysical analogue,\nthe insistence that \u201c\u2026 things must be, before they can\nstand in the relations in which indeed alone their reality can become\nperceptible to us\u201d (Micro, II, p. 583).\n5 Three Legacies\n5.1 Monism\n\nIt might be supposed\u2014wrongly\u2014that interest in Lotze cannot\nbe justified except on historical or antiquarian grounds. And, of\ncourse, if combined with a Quinean attitude, enforcing a divergence\nbetween the history of philosophy and philosophy proper, Lotze could\nbe dismissed without even a further thought. However, such objections\nmight be blunted if it can be shown that the work of Lotze continues\nto influence contemporary thought, albeit in a disguised, even\nunderground fashion, through the thought of those thinkers who came\nafter him. Lotze\u2019s main (and enduring) contributions are\nevidenced in the emergence of what others have dubbed \u201cthe\nneo-Kantian paradigm\u201d. This philosophical approach (composed by\nparts of orientation, attitude and technique) provides the shared\nbackdrop against which the analytic-continental split emerges.\nParticularly important for both Frege and Husserl, Lotze\u2019s\ninfluence extends, partly via the British Idealists (see Sullivan,\n2008), to Russell, Moore, and Carnap, on the analytic side of the\nequation, as already noted in the Preface.\n\nMost of these continued influences remain unacknowledged, even\nsubterranean. And it is only possible to isolate a few of them here.\nBeginning with the most obvious, Lotze, via the British Idealists,\nenriched the concept of the Absolute in a number of interesting ways.\nThis can be shown if we further investigate two key aspects of\nLotze\u2019s metaphysics: how his functionalist approach entails\nboth, on the one hand, monism and, on the other, a sort of\ninstrumentalism.\n\nLotze seeks to finess the problem of causality\u2014in its relation\nto the phenomena/noumena distinction\u2014by replacing it with the\nnotion of ground, or logical consequence. He is led to this conception\nby, among other things, the difficulties associated with the notion of\nmetaphysical or transeunt causality. As he framed it, the\nproblem was: if there were many separate, independently existing\nthings, then there is no credible account forthcoming about how any\nsingle given thing may causally interact with any other single given\nthing. Further, Lotze\u2019s solution aims at, once again, making\nsense of the process of our thinking and not explicating any supposed\nrelation of mind and world. Hence, he insists that the very\nindispensability of cause and effect in human cognition entails a\nnecessary rejection of metaphysical pluralism: we must abandon\n\u201cour preconceived idea that they [i.e., things] are originally\nmany and self-existent, and \u2026 [instead adopt] the view that\nthere is a truly existent being m \u2026 [and that] this\nm is the ground and basis of all individual beings\na, b, c, \u2026\u201d (OutRel,\np. 39).\n\nLotze therefore utilizes Humean-style arguments, without thereby\nconcurring with Humean conclusions (in particular Hume\u2019s radical\npsychologism). If Hume dissolved causality into a mental\npredisposition\u2014a psychological expectation of\nuniformity\u2014then Lotze reduced it, instead, to the efficient\ncausality found in a regularly occurring sequence, which expresses a\nrule or law. Hence, while it makes no sense to inquire into the deeper\nbases of causality, there remains, nonetheless, plenty of work to do;\nfor while it is utterly \u201cidle\u201d to \u201clook for the\nreason of that causality\u201d (Santayana, 1971, p.190) yet,\nnonetheless,\n\n\u2026 [t]o note and describe sequences is all we can do in such a\ncase; the ground for these sequences is simply the nature of the given\nthing, which is nothing but the law which those sequences exemplify\nand actualize. We have no business to ask for any further ground for\nthese sequences; they are the nature of things. All we can do is\nreconcile our will and imagination to this given and unexplained\norder, by showing that it gives rise to aesthetic and moral values.\n(ibid.)\n\n\nThis commitment to explaining the given by reference to ultimate\nvalues has a number of important ramifications for the unfolding of\nLotze\u2019s metaphysics. First, as there cannot be a plurality of\nmutually distinct, independently existing things, we must encourage a\nmonistic conception. Recall the aforementioned issue of how thing\na (if such existed) might causally interact with thing\nb (ditto). James provides the most admirable gloss of\nLotze\u2019s manner of reply:\n\nThe multiple independent things cannot be real in that shape, but all\nof them, if reciprocal action is to be possible between them, must be\nregarded as parts of a single real being, M. The pluralism\nwith which our view began has to give place to a monism; and the\n\u2018transeunt\u2019 interaction, being unintelligible as such, is\nto be understood as an immanent operation.\n\n\nThe words \u2018immanent operation\u2019 seem here to mean that the\nsingle real being M, of which a and b are\nmembers, is the only thing that changes, and that when it changes, it\nchanges inwardly and all over at once. When part a in it\nchanges, consequently, part b must also change, but without\nthe whole M changing this would not occur. (James, 1977, p.\n31)\n\n\nOf course, James himself strongly repudiated this argument and its\nconclusion, painting the former as verbal sophistry. But for Lotze\nthis conclusion was inevitable if the universe and its elements were\nto be properly conceptualized as \u201ca unity\u201d or\nkosmos (i.e., an aesthetic demand).\n\nSecond, things (and their posited but unproven existence) remain\nnothing but \u201cideas indispensable for the intelligibility of the\nchangeable phenomenal world\u201d (Micro, II, p. 584). The\nsubject of metaphysics is reality but reality only as it can be made\nintelligible to human knowers. Also, there are limits and paradoxes\ninvolved in our previous commitment to \u201cthis absolute existence\nwhich we symbolise as m\u201d (OutRel, p. 40). Beyond its\noneness and existence we cannot\u2014from within\nmetaphysics\u2014go. The \u2018absolute\u2019 thus functions as\n\u201ca limiting conception\u201d (ibid., p. 41).\nFurthermore, metaphysics has no intrinsic method for support and, in\nparticular, is not preceded by epistemology. In this way, among\nothers, Lotze\u2019s metaphysics attempted to chart a middle course,\none set somewhere between the absolute idealism of Hegel and his\nfollowers, on the one hand, and the critical realism of Herbart and\nhis disciples, on the other. But, most importantly, it attempted to\ncarve out the requisite space for a conception that seemed\nnaturalistic in its assumptions but which was wedded to the idealist\nnotion of \u201cunity\u201d that was founded in self-consciousness\nor personality, whether this be attained by the philosopher-scientist\nalone or as supported by the continued consciousness of God.\n\nAs we have just seen, Lotze\u2019s monism\u2014or his belief in the\nsubstantial unity of everything that exists\u2014stands opposed to\nHerbart\u2019s earlier pluralistic atomism. His redescription of\ncausality likewise coheres with his prior conviction that there must\nexist a human soul endowed with freedom of the will. Correlatively,\nLotze encourages us to think of the world as the product of the will\nof God, of an infinite spirit: reality is, hence, that which\ncorresponds to (a) self-consciousness. But is this particular\nself-consciousness or spirit\u2014which we may identify with the\nabsolute\u2014also personal in nature? Our first impulse yields a\nnegative response simply because personality normally is associated\nwith the notion of fixed limits (which would, of course, be\ninappropriate in an infinite, unlimited being). And yet, Lotze\ncontends that we must conceive of God as the preeminent personality\nand so, once again, God\u2019s own personality is \u201can immediate\ncertainty,\u201d grasped only as a necessity of the human mind. And,\nhence, we come to the concept of personality.\n\nThe reduction of cognition, emotion and volition to values was to fit\nhand-in-hand with other thinkers\u2019 preoccupation with the spectre\nof relativism. So although Lotze himself took refuge in a\nquasi-Platonic account, some neo-Kantians pushed farther in the\nattempt to ground value in some account of the nature of consciousness\nitself. Windleband, for example, developed the notion of a\n\u201cnormal [i.e., normative] consciousness,\u201d which\nis to say a consciousness that was itself productive of norms or\nvalues. The further particulars here must await another occasion. But\nSchn\u00e4delbach\u2019s observations of a fundamental shift from\nLotze\u2019s to Windelband\u2019s position\u2014or, from a\n\u201cteleological value\u2014relevance of reality \u2026 as a\nrelation of transcendental constitution in which value stood to\nvaluation\u201d to one which emphasized \u201cthe evaluating normal\nconsciousness \u2026 [as] the basis of both axiology and\nontology\u201d (cf. Schn\u00e4delbach, 1984, p. 182)\u2014surely\ncalls out for a detailed investigation in the near future.\n5.2 Persons\n\nWhile the centrality of \u2018person\u2019 stands in most natural\naffinity with the name of Kant, the idea undergoes a number of\ncritical developments in the various strands of post-Kantian idealism.\nOn the one hand, Kant had relied on personality in distinguishing\nrational being from mere things, by reference to the former\u2019s\ncapacity for self-government or autonomy. Further, Kant had insisted\nthat persons have \u201cworth\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d and that\nthis serves as a critical characteristic separating them from mere\nthings (which may be said to have only a \u201cprice\u201d). On the\nother, the scientific approach, when applied directly to human beings,\nappear to have rendered the notion of personality incomprehensible and\nsuperfluous. (Indeed, Lotze would probably not be at all surprised by\nthe threat posed to personal identity resulting from reflection on the\nquantum theory!). Also, if Christianity is re-described as an ethical\nreligion\u2014stressing the essential aspects of interior life and,\nhenceforth, abandoning all claims to metaphysical or cosmological\nsignificance\u2014then it cannot stand simply as a bulwark against\nthe materialist onslaught on inessential aspects of our\nsubjectivity.\n\nAgainst these and similar considerations Lotze argued that our own\nsubjectivity is not founded in opposition to objectivity: the subject\n(the \u2018I\u2019) is not opposed and formed in reaction to the\nobject (the \u2018not-I\u2019) but rather in its encounter with\nanother subject (a \u2018thou\u2019) (OutRel, pp. 65ff).\nConsequently, personality is an ethical concept par\nexcellance and is, qua ethical, identifiable as the\n\u201cultimate reality.\u201d Of course we cannot identify the world\nwith our own subjective consciousness without falling into either\nsolipsism or subjective idealism. Hence, we arrive, instead, at the\nnecessary conclusion of objective idealism. Lotze\u2019s view\nSantayana aptly encapsulates as follows:\n\nThe seat of the value of the world is consciousness, but of course not\nexclusively human consciousness. These moments that contain the sense\nof things, the consciousness of the cosmic law,\u2014those in fact\nthat contain the personality of cosmic life\u2014contain also its\nvalue, and the happiness to which it gives rise. To us the divine life\nis revealed in beauty, in our own seasons of happiness, and our faith\nin the deep roots that good has in nature. Our consciousness, however,\nconstitutes but an echo of that consciousness in which the purpose of\nthe world is realized; the goal of things is the happiness of\nGod\u2026. (Santayana, 1971, p. 223)\n\n\nReality is purposive and its contents collectively form an ideal unity\nand this conclusion is fostered by an awareness of the view of the\nworld comprised sub specie aeternitatis in the nature of\nsupreme consciousness.\n\nFurther, Lotze\u2019s peculiar investigations into morality provide\nyet another case study in Lotzean dialectic. Moral rules cannot be\nunderstood as merely prudential maxims or as essentially\nself-regarding in nature: moral principles must possess an\n\u201cintrinsic worth.\u201d However, this fact should not\ncapitulate us into either a mystical or religious position, on the one\nhand, or the \u201cempty formalism\u201d of Kantianism, on the\nother. For both utilitarians and egoists are so far right when they\ninsist upon the necessary presence of pleasure and pain (as concrete\ncontent) in moral deliberation. But to escape such subjective egoism\nin morality is possible only if we shift our perspective by changing\n\u201cour conception of our personality and its position in the\nworld\u201d (OutRel, p. 159). Characteristically, our\nuntutored convictions suggest the idea that moral laws express and\nembody the will of God. To escape the subsequent\nEuthyphro-style questions and difficulties, we must identify\nGod with the supreme Good:\n\nGod is nothing else than that will whose purport and mode of action\ncan be conceived of in our reflection as that which is good in\nitself\u2014as a will which can only be separated by abstraction from\nthe living form in which it exists in the real God. (ibid.,\np. 161)\n\n\nLikewise our will expresses its moral nature in the ability to freely\nchoose between competing values, without compulsion. But this choice\nis always rooted in a concrete reality\u2014our\nfeeling, for instance, that truth is rightfully to be pursued\nbecause it is good.\n\nAs already noted, by means of his enduring presence in liberal\nProtestant thought and literature, Lotze continued to be a topic of\ninterest even in post-war American theological schools and seminaries.\nIndeed, through the impress of \u201cpersonalism,\u201d\nLotze\u2019s thought\u2014handed down through Bowne and\nBrightman\u2014appears to have imposed upon Martin Luther King the\nconception of a personal god and the metaphysical underpinnings for an\ninsistence upon the \u201cdignity and worth\u201d of all\n\u201chuman personality.\u201d But this underscores the\nunacknowledged fact that it is Lotze, and not Kant, that is the most\nlikely source of King\u2019s insistence on the dignity of the human\nperson (cf. Burrow, 1999, pp. 76ff).\n\nLikewise, Lotze\u2019s contributions to the topic of polygenesis,\nwith its obvious consequences for projects of scientific racism, may\nhelp explain Lotze\u2019s line of influence, extending through the\nhistory of African American philosophy, beginning with Du Bois\u2019\nThe Souls of Black Folk (1903). While \u201cfolk\u201d has\nobvious Herderian overtones, for \u201csoul\u201d Du Bois would have\ndrawn more naturally on Lotze, under the tutelage of McCosh and James\n(cf. Rampersad, 1990, p. 74). In point of fact, it appears that it is\none of Lotze\u2019s leading ideas that provides a key impetus to Du\nBois cultural project.\n\nDu Bois practices modernist collage, invariably beginning each chapter\nof his work with an excerpt of lyric, drama or poetry, combined with\nbars of musical notation from what he dubs \u201cthe Sorrow\nSongs.\u201d Through this simple act of ostension, Du Bois directly\nposits the cultural parity of European American and African American\nculture, even as he is at pains to voice his revolutionary\nassertion:\n\nWe the darker ones come even now not altogether empty-handed:\u2026\nhere is no true American music but the wild sweet melodies of the\nNegro slave; the American fairy tales and folk-lore are Indian and\nAfrican;\u2026 Will America be poorer if she replace\u2026 her\nvulgar music with the soul of the Sorrow Songs? (Du Bois, 1903, pp.\n11\u201312).\n\n\nLittle of beauty has America given the world save the rude grandeur\nGod himself stamped on her bosom; the human spirit in this new world\nhas expressed itself in vigor and ingenuity rather than in beauty. And\nso by fateful chance the Negro folk-song\u2014the rhythmic cry of the\nslave\u2014stands to-day not simply as the sole American music, but\nas the most beautiful expression of human experience born this side\nthe seas. It has been neglected, it has been, and is, half despised,\nand above all it has been persistently mistaken and misunderstood; but\nnotwithstanding, it still remains as the singular spiritual heritage\nof the nation and the greatest gift of the Negro people (Ibid., p.\n251).\n\n\nAfrican Americans had contributed mightily in the realm of art but\nlittle, to date, in thought or politics, for the obvious reasons. But\nLotze provided a metaphysical basis for equalizing and explaining such\ncontributions to human culture: as noted above, for Lotze, the human\nsoul (or human consciousness) is equally cognition, emotion, and\nvolition. Descartes was wrong: we are not just thinking things, but\nalso feeling and willing things.\n\nThis tripartite division was expressed by Lotze in numerous\nways\u2014sometimes as concept, feeling, and sensation or, at others,\nas ideas, emotions and aspirations [Strebungen]. While\nattention has focused quite naturally on Du Bois famous \u201cdouble\nconsciousness,\u201d he articulates this in the terminology of\nLotzean tripartition: \u201ctwo souls [emotions], two thoughts\n[cognition], two unreconciled strivings [volition]\u201d (Ibid., p.\n3). While \u201ctwoness\u201d in African Americans was a pernicious\n\u201cwaste\u201d (Ibid., p. 55) of energies, they shared equally\nwith European Americans in the human experience of\n\u201cmeaning\u2026 passion\u2026 and\u2026 struggle\u201d\n(Ibid., p. viii).\n\nThe very terminology (of Streben) points us to the centrality\nof Fichte for Lotze, a leitmotiv only suggested in the\nmargins of this entry till now. Although sometimes pegged as either an\nHegelian or Herbartian, Lotze is quite clear that Fichte\u2019s\ninfluence was the decisive one \u2014 \u201cThe teaching of Fichte\nhad been different\u201d:\n\nThe problem of the spirit, he held, does not lie in the cognition of a\nblind \u2018Being\u2019 (the conception of which appeared to him as\nimpossible as it appears to us), but in action. The aforesaid world\nexternal is not, but appears to us in order to serve as material of\nour duty, as inducement or object of our action (OutMet, p.\n150).\n\n\nThis is, of course, the well-known Fichtean subjugation of theoretical\nto practical reason. But Lotze believes that action here is\nmerely a formal concept and so he seeks the following emendation:\n\nFor the aforesaid \u2018action\u2019 of Fichte we substitute the\nmorally Good, for which the action is simply the indispensable form of\nactualization; we besides conceive of the \u2018beautiful,\u2019\ntoo, and the \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018blessedness,\u2019 as\nunited with this Good into one complex of all that has Value\n(OutMet, p. 151).\n\n\nThe \u2018morally good\u2019 [das sittlich-Gute] can only\nbe realized \u2014be actualized\u2014 through action of\npersons. Although all of the words used to describe the purpose\nof life\u2014including happiness or blessedness\u2014point us\ntowards a super-ordinate concept, that of the valuable, the focus\nrests squarely on the human person.\n\nBut are we now not confined within a realm of pure subjectivity,\n\u201csince all the Value of what is valuable has existence only in\nthe spirit that enjoys it\u201d (OutMet, p. 152)? Certainly\nnot.\n\nThe objectivity of our cognition consists, therefore, in this, that it\nis not a meaningless play of mere seeming; but it brings before us a\nWorld whose coherency is order in pursuance of the injunction of the\nSole Reality in the world,\u2014to wit, of the Good. Our cognition\nthus possesses more of truth than it copied exactly a world of objects\nthat has no value in itself. Although it does not comprehend in what\nmanner all that is phenomenon is presented to its view, still it\nunderstands what is the meaning of it all; and is like to a spectator\nwho comprehends the aesthetic significance of that which takes place\non the stage of a theatre, and would gain nothing essential if he were\nto see besides the machinery by means of which the changes are\neffected on that stage (ibid.).\n\n\nThe metaphysical claim here is clear even if not to contemporary\ntastes: the \u201cobjectivity of our cognition\u201d lies in the\nfact that it is not a meaningless game of mere appearance, but that it\npresents to us a world whose nexus is ordered in accordance with the\ncommandments of the only Real [Realen] in the world, the Good\n[des Guten]. And thus we come, inexorably, to value.\n5.3 Value Theory\n\nTo recapitulate, briefly: First, we must abandon the mere prejudice\nthat the external world exists complete and independent of our minds,\nand that our thinking is merely a \u201cuseless appendage\u201d\nwhich merely reproduces the contents of the world, as a fruitless\nactivity. Nor should we fall into the trap of absolute idealism, which\nso reduces the world of things that they can easily be fitted into the\nformal categories of our thinking (that is, reduce metaphysics to\nlogic). The right way was indicated by Fichte: our minds are not for\nthe mere cognitive reproduction of meaningless things, but rather a\n\u201cworld\u201d only appears to us in order to serve as a stage\ninducing us to meaningful action. But action characterizes only the\nsubjective side of things: on the other side, we must identify the\nmoral good, and our action becomes, hence, merely a means of realizing\nthis end.\n\nThe terminology of \u201cmoral good\u201d is thus shorthand for the\nentire complex of values (and, hence, can be identified with what\nearlier thinkers called the good, the beautiful, happiness, or\nblessedness). But although this apprehension of the world is dependent\nupon mind, it is not subjective. Instead, our cognition of the world\nand its value is objective: a world can only be a system of the truly\nreal, that is to say, a system ordered according to the good. For this\npurpose, we need not understand the mechanics of our cognition and,\nindeed, we would gain little from this knowledge, for the central\nthing is the apprehension of meaningfulness present to us in a world\nof mere physical objects.\n\nFinally, then we come to the subject of value and validity, which\ndescribes an immense topic.The following restricts itself to but one\nsmall part of the continental side, briefly discussing the case of\nHeidegger. Heidegger\u2019s long engagement with the Lotzean\nfoundations of his neo-Kantian teachers has not yet received\nwidespread acknowledgement (see, however, Crowell, 2001). The early\nHeidegger seemingly operated wholly within the neo-Kantian paradigm\nand even the first emergence of the phenomenological impulse was\ndirected, at least in part, at a reconceptualization of neo-Kantian\ntopics and questions. Especially revealing is the lecture course of\nSummer Semester 1919, which aimed at nothing less than \u201ca\nphenomenological critique of transcendental philosophy of value\u201d\n(Heidegger, 2000, p. 108). Thereby, Heidegger intended to utilize\nBrentano, Dilthey and Husserl, among others, to combat and reconstruct\nthe insights of Windelband, Rickert and Lask, on the one hand, and\nalso the Marburgers (and even Simmel), on the other. And the common\nroot of these heterogeneous schools and thinkers had to begin with\nLotze\u2019s decisive contribution (cf. ibid., pp.\n116\u2013118).\n\nAccording to Heidegger, in the midst of the nineteenth century two\nglobal errors emerged, only to attain prominence in philosophical\npractice of that day: naturalism and historicism. The only school that\navoided these two was \u201cspeculative theism\u201d and it was\nunder their influence that Lotze\u2019s breakthrough emerged: the\ndecisive repudiation of naturalism without falling into mere\n\u201chistory of philosophy.\u201d This was accomplished by\nLotze\u2019s revival of the non-sensory while avoiding \u201cthe\nextravagant naturalistic supra-sensoriness of the old\nmetaphysics\u201d (Heidegger, 2000, p. 117). In his articulation of a\nphilosophy of value, Lotze \u201ckilled two birds with one\nstone\u201d: \u201ca safeguarding of the continuity and connection\nwith German idealism, but simultaneously a critical deflection of\nspeculative idealism\u201d (ibid., p. 118). (But this\nassessment would not stand, for by the Nietzsche lectures (cf.\nHeidegger, 1977, esp. pp. 70ff) of 1936\u201340, Heidegger has come\nto believe that a reliance on the terminology of value and values was\nsimply the positivist version of the metaphysical (which was supposed\nto have been thoroughly vanquished) (cf. Schn\u00e4delbach, 1984, pp.\n190f).)\n\nFurther substantiation of Heidegger\u2019s deep and continuing\nstruggle with Lotze (and the neo-Kantian paradigm he helped engender)\nis now available in English in the newly translated 1925/26 lecture\ncourse on Logic (Heidegger, 2010). Here Heidegger makes\nexplicit the exact same thesis, later elaborated by Gillian Rose,\nnamely that Lotze is indeed the founder of the paradigm so excellently\ndeveloped and exploited by the neo-Kantians: \u201cThe\n\u2018neo-Kantian paradigm\u2019 refers to those who attempted a new\nanswer to the Kantian questions of validity within the framework of\nvalidity and values first developed by Lotze\u201d (Rose, 1981, p.\n6). Coincident with this is a shift, by these later thinkers, to\nphilosophy as a kind of purified methodologism, a pure and general\n(but not at all formal) logic, directed towards a vision of\nscience \u201cas an ideal network of propositions\u201d\n(Heidegger, 2010, p. 50). By Heidegger\u2019s later lights, all of\nneo-Kantianism and much of Husserl was sharply inflected by this\n(unconscious) prejudice.\n\nWhile a fuller discussion of this interesting topic is not possible\nhere, some light is nevertheless shed by a brief consideration of the\ntwentieth-century reaction to neo-Kantianism, as found in the\nthought of (mostly) later thinkers (inter alia, Heidegger\nhimself):\n\nDilthey, Heidegger, Mannheim, Benjamin and Gadamer have this criticism\nin common: the neo-Kantian answers to the question of validity debase\nthe question of being, reality, life or history \u2026 [they] return\nto the Kantian question of validity, \u2018What are the preconditions\nof experience?\u2019, but judge that the Kantian reference to the\ncategories and their application itself has a precondition:\n\u2018life\u2019 (Dilthey), \u2018social-situation\u2019\n(Mannheim), \u2018Dasein\u2019 (Heidegger),\n\u2018history\u2019 (Gadamer). These become the presupposition of\nthe use of the categories or of meaning, the \u2018a\npriori\u2019 of a new kind of ontology (Rose, 1981, pp.\n22\u201323).\n\n\n(Note that from the analytic side, the emergence of concepts such as\n\u2018form of life\u2019 and \u2018ordinary language\u2019 may be\nseen to play similar roles.) As a consequence, whether continental (or\nanalytic) philosophy deserve the appellation of neo-neo-Kantianism\nremains an open question.\n\nHeidegger\u2019s rejection of Lotze and neo-Kantianism by means of a\nreturn to a more basic or primodial notion is quite explicit in the\nLogic lectures:\n\nLotze uses the word \u201cbeing\u201d as equivalent to\n\u201cout-there-ness,\u201d and therefore he uses\n\u201cbeing\u201d for sensible beings, material beings in the widest\nsense. I have already stressed that the currently common term\n\u201csensible entity\u201d does not characterize being\n[Sein], but only determines the way of apprehending being\n\u2026 I use \u201cbeing\u201d in the exact opposite sense, and in\nconnection with the genuine tradition of Greek philosophy broadly\nspeaking (Heidegger, 2010, p. 53).\n\n\n(A few pages later, Heidegger also makes clear where the necessary\nreturn in philosophy lies\u2014\u201cThe need to return to\nAristotle\u201d (Heidegger, 2010, p. 90)\u2014with, of course, the\nimportant proviso that \u201c[t]he Greeks had no suspicion of this\nunfathomable problematic, which opens up before us once we have seen\nthis connection [between being and time]\u201d (Heidegger, 2010, p.\n163).)\n\nUnfortunately, there are grounds for thinking that this turn to\nmetacritique\u2014i.e., the application of neo-Kantian style\ncriticism to neo-Kantianism (and its unacknowledged\npresuppositions)\u2014nevertheless, \u201cin spite of its radical\nintentions, remains within the paradigm of Geltung and cannot\nmake the transition to a speculative position\u201d (Rose, 1981, p.\n24). Instead, almost all the lines of thought, dominant in the\ntwentieth century, ultimately converge and terminate at \u201ca\nneo-Fichtean station\u201d (ibid.). And there, it appears, we\nremain.\n",
