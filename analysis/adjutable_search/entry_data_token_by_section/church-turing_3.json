    "main_text": "The 1936 Thesis and its Context || Formulations of Turing\u2019s thesis in terms of numbers\n1.3 Formulations of Turing\u2019s thesis in terms of numbers\n\nIn his 1936 paper, which he titled \u201cOn Computable Numbers, with\nan Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\u201d, Turing wrote:\n\n\nAlthough the subject of this paper is ostensibly the computable\nnumbers, it is almost equally easy to define and investigate\ncomputable functions \u2026 I have chosen the computable numbers for\nexplicit treatment as involving the least cumbrous technique. (1936\n[2004: 58])\n\n\nComputable numbers are (real) numbers whose decimal representation can\nbe generated progressively, digit by digit, by a Turing machine.\nExamples are:\n\nany number whose decimal representation consists of a finite\nnumber of digits (e.g., 109, 1.142)\nall rational numbers, such as one-third, two-sevenths, etc.\nsome irrational real numbers, such as \u03c0 and e.\n\n\nSome real numbers, though, are uncomputable, as Turing\nproved. Turing\u2019s proof pointed to specific examples of\nuncomputable real numbers, but it is easy to see in a general way that\nthere must be real numbers that cannot be computed by any\nTuring machine, since there are more real numbers than there\nare Turing-machine programs. There can be no more Turing-machine\nprograms than there are whole numbers, since the programs can be\ncounted: 1st program, 2nd program, and so on;\nbut, as Cantor proved in 1874, there are vastly more real numbers than\nwhole numbers (Cantor 1874).\n\nAs Turing said, \u201cit is almost equally easy to define and\ninvestigate computable functions\u201d: There is, in a certain sense,\nlittle difference between a computable number and a computable\nfunction. For example, the computable number .14159\u2026 (formed of\nthe digits following the decimal point in \u03c0, 3.14159\u2026)\ncorresponds to the computable function: \\(f(1) = 1,\\)\u00a0\\(f(2) =\n4,\\) \\(f(3) = 1,\\)\u00a0\\(f(4) = 5,\\)\u00a0\\(f(5) = 9,\\)\u2026 .\n\nAs well as formulations of Turing\u2019s thesis like the one given\nabove, Turing also formulated his thesis in terms of numbers:\n\n\n[T]he \u201ccomputable numbers\u201d include all numbers which would\nnaturally be regarded as computable. (Turing 1936 [2004: 58])\n\n\nand\n\n\nIt is my contention that these operations [the operations of an\nL.C.M.] include all those which are used in the computation of a\nnumber. (Turing 1936 [2004: 60])\n\n\nIn the first of these two formulations, Turing is stating that every\nnumber which is able to be calculated by an effective method (that is,\n\u201call numbers which would naturally be regarded as\ncomputable\u201d) is included among the numbers whose decimal\nrepresentations can be written out progressively by one or another\nTuring machine. In the second, Turing is saying that the operations of\na Turing machine include all those that a human mathematician needs to\nuse when calculating a number by means of an effective method.\n",
