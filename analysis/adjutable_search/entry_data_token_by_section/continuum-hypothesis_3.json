    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || The Foreman-Magidor Program\n2.2 The Foreman-Magidor Program\nThe goal of the Foreman-Magidor program was to show that large\ncardinal axioms also implied that the third version of CH held for all\nsets in L(\u211d) and, more generally, all universally Baire sets. In\nother words, the goal was to show that large cardinal axioms implied\nthat \u0398L(\u211d) \u2264 \u21352 and, more\ngenerally, that \u0398L(A,\u211d)\n\u2264 \u21352 for each universally Baire\nset A. \n The motivation came from the celebrated results of Foreman,\nMagidor and Shelah on Martin's Maximum (MM), which showed that\nassuming large cardinal axioms one can always force to obtain a\nprecipitous ideal on \u21352 without collapsing\n\u21352 (see Foreman, Magidor & Shelah (1988)). The program involved a two-part strategy: \n\nStrengthen this result to show that assuming large\ncardinal axioms one can always force to obtain a saturated\nideal on \u21352 without collapsing\n\u21352. \nShow that the existence of\nsuch a saturated ideal implies that \u0398L(\u211d)\n\u2264 \u21352 and, more generally that\n\u0398L(A,\u211d) \u2264 \u21352 for every\nuniversally Baire set A.\n\nThis would show that show that \u0398L(\u211d)\n\u2264 \u21352 and, more generally that\n\u0398L(A,\u211d) \u2264 \u21352 for every\nuniversally Baire set A.[4]\n\n In December 1991, the following result dashed the hopes of this\nprogram. \n\nTheorem 2.1\n(Woodin). Assume that the non-stationary ideal\non \u21351 is saturated and that there is a\nmeasurable cardinal. Then \u03b4\u033012 =\n\u21352. \nThe point is that the hypothesis of this theorem can always be\nforced assuming large cardinals. Thus, it is possible to have\n\u0398L(\u211d) > \u21352 (in fact,\n\u03b4\u033013\n> \u21352). \n Where did the program go wrong? Foreman and Magidor had an\napproximation to (B) and in the end it turned out that (B) is\ntrue. \n\nTheorem 2.2\n(Woodin). Assume that there is a proper\nclass of Woodin cardinals and that there is a saturated ideal\non \u21352. Then for every A\n\u2208 \u0393\u221e,\n\u0398L(A,\u211d)\n\u2264 \u21352. \nSo the trouble is with (A). \n This illustrates an interesting contrast between our three\nversions of the effective continuum hypothesis, namely, that they can\ncome apart. For while large cardinals rule out definable\ncounterexamples of the first two kinds, they cannot rule out definable\ncounterexamples of the third kind. But again we must stress that they\ncannot prove that there are such counterexamples. \n But there is an important point: Assuming large cardinal axioms\n(ADL(\u211d) suffices), although one can produce outer\nmodels in which \u03b4\u033013\n> \u21352 it is not currently known how to\nproduce outer models in which \u03b4\u033013\n> \u21353 or even \u0398L(\u211d)\n> \u21353. Thus it is an open possibility that\nfrom ZFC +ADL(\u211d) one can prove\n\u0398L(\u211d) \u2264 \u21353. Were this to\nbe the case, it would follow that although large cardinals cannot rule\nout the definable failure of CH they can rule out\nthe definable failure of 2\u21350 =\n\u21352. This could provide some insight into the size\nof the continuum, underscoring the centrality of\n\u21352. \nFurther Reading: For more on the three effective versions\nof CH see Martin (1976); for more on the Foreman-Magidor program see\nForeman & Magidor (1995) and the introduction to Woodin (1999). \n3. The Case for \u00acCH\nThe above results led Woodin to the identification of a\n\u201ccanonical\u201d model in which CH fails and this formed the\nbasis of his an argument that CH is false. In Section 3.1 we will\ndescribe the model and in the remainder of the section we will present\nthe case for the failure of CH. In Section 3.2 we will introduce\n\u03a9-logic and the other notions needed to make the case. In\nSection 3.3 we will present the case. \n",
