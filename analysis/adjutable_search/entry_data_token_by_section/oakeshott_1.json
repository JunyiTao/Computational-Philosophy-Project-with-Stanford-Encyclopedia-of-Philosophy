    "main_text": "Modes of Experience\n2. Modes of Experience\n\n\nPhilosophers have used the word \u201cmode\u201d to refer to an\nattribute that a thing can possess or the form a substance can\ntake. For Oakeshott, this thing or substance is experience, by which\nhe means both the activity of experiencing and what is experienced,\nunderstood as inseparable and therefore as a unity. Looked at from\neither side, experience involves thinking and therefore ideas. He has\nin mind the kind of mutually correlated subject-object relationship\nthat Hegel examines in the Phenomenology (which Oakeshott\nread in his 20s), according to which what is experienced\u2014the\nobject\u2014is itself thought. Where a body of ideas has achieved a\nsubstantial degree of integrity and differentiation, a mode of thought\ncan be said to have emerged. Sometimes, a mode is understood to be an\naspect of something larger or more real than itself (Descartes 1641:\n27\u201328, 31). In Experience and Its Modes there are\ntraces of the view, also discernible in Spinoza and Hegel, that this\n\u201clarger thing\u201d is everything that exists, the sum total of\nexperience identified as God or the Absolute. Oakeshott does not use\nthe word \u201cmode\u201d in later writings in a way that postulates\na universal or ultimate reality. But neither is a mode of thought just\nany kind of thinking. It is an \u201cautonomous\u201d kind of\nthinking, one that is \u201cspecifiable in terms of exact\nconditions\u201d and \u201clogically incapable of denying or\nconfirming the conclusions of any other mode\u201d (OH 2). A\nmode constitutes a distinct and self-consistent \u201cwhole of\ninterlocking meanings\u201d (VLL 38), a world of ideas\nresting on its own criteria of truth, factuality, and reality. A\npuzzle, then, is how the modes can talk to one another, and the\nsolution is that as modes they don't. There is a difference between\nthe modes as ideal types and their instantiation in actual thoughts\nand actions, and therefore between philosophically differentiating\nthem and investigating them historically or sociologically. \n \n\nThinking that is involved in acting is one such mode, which Oakeshott\ncalls \u201cpractice\u201d. Another is \u201chistory\u201d, by\nwhich he means neither \u201cthe notional grand total of all that has\never happened\u201d nor some part of it, whose makers are the\nparticipants in the occurrences that constitute it, but rather a\ndistinct kind of inquiry into and understanding of events. Because\nevents are not given but must be inferred from what the historian\ntreats as evidence, history is made by the historian (OH\n1\u20132). It is, moreover, an inquiry that aims to account for past\nevents as intelligible outcomes of antecedent events. In contrast to\nhistory, understood in this way, \u201cscience\u201d as a mode is\ndefined by its search for regularities that can account for the\noccurrence of repeatable events and for ways to express these\nregularities as relationships between quantities. This way of\ndistinguishing between history and science locates Oakeshott in the\ntradition of German Neo-Kantian of the previous generation, Windelband\nand Rickert especially, in which the Naturwissenschaften and\nGeisteswissenschaften were treated as distinct\nepistemological forms. History and science are both inherently\nexplanatory, but the kinds of explanations they provide are\ndifferent. Genuine history is also distinguished from ideas about the\npast that are shaped by current practical concerns (the\n\u201cpractical past\u201d). The same holds for science: as a mode\nof inquiry, science is different from the practical application of\nscientific knowledge. From this perspective, we might see engineering\nas a practical discipline rather than a scientific one. \n\n\nModes, then, are distinct and provisionally coherent kinds of\nknowledge. In Experience and Its Modes, Oakeshott aims to\nidentify the presuppositions in terms of which a mode can be made\ncoherent and distinguished from other modes. Modal distinctions are\ncategorial. A categorial distinction is one of kind rather than\ndegree. Philosophers have disagreed about whether the identified kinds\nare natural (ontological) or conceptual (epistemological): the former\nare categories of being (Aristotle), the latter categories of\nunderstanding (Kant). Philosophers have also disagreed about whether a\ncategorial scheme must be exhaustive and fixed or, alternatively, can\nbe open and mutable. The modes that Oakeshott identifies in\nExperience and Its Modes\u2014history, science, and\npractice, to which he later added \u201cpoetry\u201d (aesthetic\nexperience)\u2014can from one angle be seen as epistemological\ncategories, not ontological ones. But from another angle the\ndistinction between being and knowing does not make sense\n(Hegel). There can be no absolute difference between what a thing is\nand how it is conceived in a particular context because there are no\n\u201cthings in themselves\u201d in the Kantian sense that are\nindependent of thought. And though the modes are mutually exclusive,\nOakeshott does not think that they form a closed set. The modes he\nidentifies are intellectual constructions that have appeared in the\ncourse of human experience. This suggests that they could change or\neven disappear, and that new modes might emerge. But here we must\ndistinguish between a mode and its instantiation. History was a\npossible form of thinking before anyone started to think historically\nand would remain a possibility even if human beings were to cease\nthinking historically. \n\n\nA number of other conclusions follow from this understanding of\nmodality. First, a mode of experience implies a distinct and\nautonomous kind of understanding. It implies a universe of discourse\nwith its own arguments and ways of assessing and grounding\nthem. Because propositions in one mode of discourse have no standing\nin another, truth is coherence, however defined, within a given\nmode. To argue across a modal boundary is to commit the fallacy of\nignoratio elenchi (irrelevance). If there is any relationship\nbetween the modes it is conversational, not argumentative: cross-modal\nencounters yield differences, not supra-modal conclusions. Oakeshott\nsometimes makes this point by speaking of modes as\n\u201cvoices\u201d in an inter-modal conversation (RP\n488\u2013491, 497). In conversation the rules of relevance are\nrelaxed: a conversation is not an argument. Second, because what\ncounts as rational in discourse depends on the mode of discourse\nitself, there is no extra-modal definition of reason or\nrationality. The illusion that there is arises from privileging what\ncounts as reasonable within a given mode and denigrating what is\nconsidered reasonable in other modes. This illusion of superiority\ngenerates the narrowness, and at times hubris, characteristic of each\nmode connoted by the labels \u201chistoricism\u201d,\n\u201cscientism\u201d, \u201cpragmatism\u201d, and\n\u201caestheticism\u201d. A conversational as opposed to\nargumentative juxtaposition of modal voices is respectful of\ndifferences and for that reason inherently civilized, which means that\nto insist on the primacy of any single mode is not only boorish but\nbarbaric. And because the modes are independent of one another, and\nnone is more expressive of an imagined mode-independent reality than\nany other, there can be no hierarchy of modes.\n\n\nIn making these points, Oakeshott differs from philosophical Idealists\nin Germany, Italy, and England who were proposing similar categorial\nschemes around the same time. These include Benedetto Croce, who\ndistinguishes the theoretical modes of art, history, and philosophy\nfrom the practical modes of economics and ethics, and R.G.\nCollingwood, who in Speculum Mentis, an early work, begins\nwith Hegel\u2019s triad of art, religion, and philosophy, identifying\nphilosophy broadly defined with \u201cknowledge\u201d and\ndistinguishing three kinds of knowledge\u2014science, history, and\nphilosophy narrowly defined\u2014to generate a fivefold hierarchy of\nmodes. In Collingwood\u2019s scheme, art is at the bottom, followed\nby religion, the former concerned to imagine or \u201csuppose\u201d\nand the latter to \u201cassert\u201d, and then by the three kinds of\ngenuine knowledge, which are distinguished from art and religion in\nbeing critical. Philosophy proper is the most critical of all because\nit aims to transcend the other forms (Collingwood 1924; Connelly\n2015). Oakeshott, partly in response to Collingwood, folds art and\nreligion into practice, denies that modes can be ordered\nhierarchically, and defines philosophy as the activity of\ninterrogating presuppositions, including its own, and therefore not\nitself a mode. But despite characterizing philosophy as supramodal, he\nsevers the tie between philosophy and unqualified\nknowledge\u2014\u201cthe Absolute\u201d\u2014that one finds in\nIdealist metaphysics from Hegel to Collingwood. The distinction\nbetween modal thinking and philosophy that Oakeshott asserts in\nExperience and Its Modes reappears in On Human\nConduct as a distinction between \u201cconditional\u201d and\n\u201cunconditional\u201d theorizing, the former resting on\nassumptions that the latter questions. \n\n\nThe idea of a hierarchy of modes is not particular to Idealism. Where\nthere are different understandings, someone interested in reconciling\nthem might argue that they represent different levels of\nunderstanding, some more inclusive and in that sense higher than\nothers. In contrast to unifying philosophies, including philosophical\nIdealism, Oakeshott\u2019s position is pluralist and\nanti-hierarchical. In this respect he has more in common with Wilhelm\nDilthey, who struggled with the issue of relativity in metaphysics and\nhow to distinguish the human from the natural sciences, than with the\nBritish Idealists\u2014Bradley, Bosanquet, and McTaggart among\nothers\u2014with whom he is often associated (Boucher 2012). For\nOakeshott, all knowledge is conditional. Theorizing is \u201can\nengagement of arrivals and departures\u201d in which \u201cthe\nnotion of an unconditional or definitive understanding may hover in\nthe background, but \u2026 has no part in the adventure\u201d\n(OHC 2\u20133). In attempting to construct a coherent view\nof the world the philosopher \u201cputs out to sea\u201d\n(OHC 40) and is perpetually en voyage: there are no\n\u201cfinal solutions\u201d in philosophy any more than in practical\naffairs. \n",
