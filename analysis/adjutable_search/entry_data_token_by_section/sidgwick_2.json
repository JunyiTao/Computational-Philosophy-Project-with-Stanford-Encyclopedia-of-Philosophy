    "main_text": "The Methods Of Ethics And Philosophy || Reconstruction and Reconciliation\n2.2 Reconstruction and Reconciliation\n\nFor better or worse, Sidgwick uses the language of hedonism to label\ntwo out of the three methods with which he will be chiefly\nconcerned\u2014namely, egoistic hedonism (or rational egoism) and\nuniversal hedonism (or utilitarianism). The third method is variously\ncalled dogmatic or intuitional morality, which is somewhat ambiguously\nconstrued as either the (mostly negative) precepts of common-sense\nmorality or the somewhat more refined version of these set out in the\ntheories of such moral theorists as Whewell, T. R. Birks, or Henry\nCalderwood (Whewell 1864; Birks 1874; Calderwood 1876; Donagan 1977,\n1992). The main point of such views is that conformity to such moral\nduties as truth-telling, promise-keeping, temperance etc. is held to\nbe \u201cthe practically ultimate end of moral actions\u201d and\nthese duties are \u201cunconditionally prescribed\u201d and\ndiscernible with \u201creally clear and finally valid\nintuition\u201d, though it is the job of the moral theorist to set\nthem out with proper precision and \u201cto arrange the results as\nsystematically as possible, and by proper definitions and explanations\nto remove vagueness and prevent conflict\u201d. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907:\n101]). Indeed, the plain person is apt to be rather confused about the\ndifferences between the methods of ethics, arbitrarily deploying one\nor another without recognizing any inconsistency.\n\nThe three methods of ethics\u2014egoism, intuitional morality, and\nutilitarianism\u2014respectively form the subject matter of books two\nthrough four of the Methods, which brackets them with an\nopening book reviewing the whole work and a concluding chapter on\n\u201cThe Mutual Relations of the Three Methods\u201d. Each of these\nbooks represents in itself a classic treatment of the view at issue,\nthough it is the chapter on utilitarianism that has perhaps most often\nbeen treated as such. This architectonic can, however, make it\nsomewhat difficult to follow the thread of Sidgwick\u2019s thought,\nparticularly on the more philosophical points having to do with\nintuitionism. Indeed, intuitionism figures in both the second method\nof ethics, and, in a more philosophical form, in the treatment of all\nthe methods of ethics, particularly when it comes to the discussion of\nfundamental principles. As Sidgwick explains, although some might\nthink that conscience delivers immediate judgments on particular\nacts\u2014a view he variously calls aesthetic, perceptional or ultra\nintuitionism\u2014\u201creflective persons, in proportion to their\nreflectiveness, come to rely rather on abstract universal intuitions\nrelating to classes of cases conceived under general notions\u201d.\nHence, dogmatic intuitional morality, which in the Methods is\nrather awkwardly taken to cover both more deontological views and\nnon-hedonistic teleological ones, on the ground that the latter tend\nto construe virtue in the same fashion as the simply the done thing,\nwhatever the consequences. But the process of reflection should not\nstop there: there is another, more sophisticated phase of\nintuitionism. Without \n\n\nbeing disposed to deny that conduct commonly judged to be right is so,\nwe may yet require some deeper explanation why it is so. \n\n\nThus, philosophical intuitionism, \n\n\nwhile accepting the morality of common sense as in the main sound,\nstill attempts to find for it a philosophic basis which it does not\nitself offer: to get one or more principles more absolutely and\nundeniably true and evident, from which the current rules might be\ndeduced, either just as they are commonly received or with slight\nmodifications and rectifications. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 102])\n\n\nThe ascent to this philosophical intuitionism is especially evident in\nthe treatment of common-sense or intuitional morality. As Sidgwick\nexplained in reply to Calderwood\u2019s critical review of the\nMethods, which asked why he had not simply confined himself\n\u201cto the consideration of Intuitionism in its most philosophical\nform\u201d, that tactic \n\n\nwould have led me at once to Utilitarianism: because I hold that the\nonly moral intuitions which sound philosophy can accept as ultimately\nvalid are those which at the same time provide the only possible\nphilosophical basis of the Utilitarian creed. I thus necessarily\nregard Prof. Calderwood\u2019s Intuitionism as a phase in the\ndevelopment of the Intuitional method, which comes naturally between\nthe crude thought of Butler\u2019s \u201cplain man\u201d and the\nRational Utilitarianism to which I ultimately endeavor to lead my\nreader. \n\n\nThat is, allowing that the morality of common sense is his as well, he\nmust as a philosopher nonetheless\n\n\nask myself whether I see clearly and distinctly the self-evidence of\nany particular maxims of duty, as I see that of the formal principles\n\u201cthat what is right for me must be right for all persons in\nprecisely similar circumstances\u201d and \u201cthat I ought to\nprefer the greater good of another to my own lesser good\u201d: I\nhave no doubt whatever that I do not. I am conscious of a strong\nimpression, an opinion on which I habitually act without hesitation,\nthat I ought to speak truth, to perform promises, to requite benefits,\n& c., and also of powerful moral sentiments prompting me to the\nobservance of these rules; but on reflection I can now clearly\ndistinguish such opinions and sentiments from the apparently immediate\nand certain cognition that I have of the formal principles above\nmentioned. But I could not always have made this distinction; and I\nbelieve that the majority of moral persons do not make it: most\n\u201cplain men\u201d would probably say, at any rate on the first\nconsideration of the matter, that they saw the obligations of Veracity\nand Good Faith as clearly and immediately as they saw those of Equity\nand Rational Benevolence. How then am I to argue with such persons? It\nwill not settle the matter to tell them that they have observed their\nown mental processes wrongly, and that more careful introspection will\nshow them the non-intuitive character of what they took for\nintuitions; especially as in many cases I do not believe that the\nerror is one of misobservation. Still less am I inclined to dispute\nthe \u201cprimitiveness\u201d or \u201cspontaneousness\u201d or\n\u201coriginality\u201d of these apparent intuitions. On the\ncontrary, I hold that here, as in other departments of thought, the\nprimitive spontaneous processes of the mind are mixed with error,\nwhich is only to be removed gradually by comprehensive reflection upon\nthe results of these processes. Through such a course of reflection I\nhave endeavored to lead my readers in chaps. 2\u201310 of Book III of\nmy treatise: in the hope that after they have gone through it they may\nfind their original apprehension of the self-evidence of moral maxims\nimportantly modified. (Sidgwick 1876: 564)\n\n\nAnd as he explained in another important commentary on the\nMethods, \u201cThe Establishment of Ethical First\nPrinciples\u201d, he accepts Aristotle\u2019s distinction between\nlogical priority and priority in the knowledge of a particular person,\nsuch that we \n\n\nare thus enabled to see that a proposition may be self-evident, i.e.,\nmay be properly cognisable without being viewed in connexion with any\nother propositions; though in order that its truth may be apparent to\nsome particular mind, there is still required some rational process\nconnecting it with propositions previously accepted by that mind. \n\n\nThis latter can be done in two ways: by showing how \u201csome\nlimited and qualified statement\u201d supposed to be self-evident is\nonly part of a \u201csimpler and wider proposition\u201d, on which\nthe limitations turn out to be arbitrary, and by establishing some\ngeneral criteria \u201cfor distinguishing true first\nprinciples\u201d that are then used to \n\n\nconstruct a strictly logical deduction by which, applying their\ngeneral criteria to the special case of ethics, we establish the true\nfirst principles of this latter subject. (Sidgwick 1879: 106\u20137)\n\n\n\nTruth being one, both tactics should ultimately converge on the same\nconclusions.\n\nWhether Sidgwick succeeded in avoiding mere \u201chostile criticism\nfrom the outside\u201d in his analysis of common-sense morality is\nopen to debate; certainly, the critical reflection can seem quite\nremorseless, with the utilitarian repeatedly demonstrating to the\ndogmatic intuitionist\n\n\nthat the principles of Truth, Justice, etc. have only a dependent and\nsubordinate validity: arguing either that the principle is really only\naffirmed by Common-Sense as a general rule admitting of exceptions and\nqualifications, as in the case of Truth, and that we require some\nfurther principle for systematising these exceptions and\nqualifications; or that the fundamental notion is vague and needs\nfurther determination, as in the case of Justice; and further, that\nthe different rules are liable to conflict with each other, and that\nwe require some higher principle to decide the issue thus raised; and\nagain, that the rules are differently formulated by different persons,\nand that these differences admit of no Intuitional solution, while\nthey show the vagueness and ambiguity of the common moral notions to\nwhich the Intuitionist appeals. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 421])\n\n\nTime and again, common sense collapses into utilitarian thinking, or\nis shown to presuppose it, or is at least revealed as requiring\nsomething very like it. This effort to criticize and assimilate\ncommon-sense moral rules went far beyond the efforts of J. S. Mill and\nhas served as a template for the utilitarian or consequentialist work\nof Smart (1973), Brandt (1979), Hare (1981), Parfit (1984,\n2011\u20132017), Hardin (1988), Gibbard (1982, 1990), de Lazari-Radek\nand Singer (2014, 2016, 2021), and Woodard (2019). Like so many in the\nutilitarian tradition, Sidgwick ended up recognizing the moral\nstanding of non-human animals, puzzling over questions of suicide,\ndefending a notion of intention covering all foreseen consequences,\nrejecting purely retributive accounts of punishment, embracing a\ncosmopolitan (rather than nationalistic) outlook, and\nthinking\u2014though not public insisting\u2014that orthodox\nreligion and its morality were often dogmatic and superstitious. More\noriginally, he initiated the (modern) philosophical discussion of the\nproblem of future generations and optimal population growth, arguing\nthat \n\n\nstrictly conceived, the point up to which, on Utilitarian principles,\npopulation ought to be encouraged to increase, is not that at which\naverage happiness is the greatest possible \u2026 but that at which\nthe product formed by multiplying the number of persons living into\nthe amount of average happiness reaches its maximum. (Sidgwick 1874\n[1907: 415\u201316]) \n\n\nSidgwick was not always consistent in his treatment of this issue of\naverage versus total utility, but even so, had he done nothing more\nthan formulate this issue, his philosophical fame would have been\nsecured. The flourishing fields of population ethics and justice for\nfuture generations, which received an enormous boost from Parfit,\nespecially his Reasons and Persons (1984), reflect the\nseminal Sidgwickian influence at many, many points, though as with\nhedonism, the controversies have often deepened rather than dissipated\n(McMahan, Campbell, Goodrich, & Ramakrishnan [eds] 2022).\n\nSidgwick made other original contributions as well. Although it can\nseem strained and anachronistic to apply the classification of\n\u201cact\u201d or \u201crule\u201d utilitarianism to him, the\nscholarly consensus does for the most part classify him as an act\nutilitarian (Gray 1984; Williams 1995; Hooker 2000a,b; de Lazari-Radek\n& Singer 2014, 2021; Crisp 2015). But he does not fit the stock\nstereotype of that position. Among other things, it is quite clear\nthat he defended a very \u201cindirect\u201d form of utilitarianism,\ngoing so far as to defend the possibility of utilitarianism entailing\na self-effacing, even esoteric morality:\n\n\nThus, on Utilitarian principles, it may be right to do and privately\nrecommend, under certain circumstances, what it would not be right to\nadvocate openly; it may be right to teach openly to one set of persons\nwhat it would be wrong to teach to others; it may be conceivably right\nto do, if it can be done with comparative secrecy, what it would be\nwrong to do in the face of the world; and even, if perfect secrecy can\nbe reasonably expected, what it would be wrong to recommend by private\nadvice or example. These conclusions are all of a paradoxical\ncharacter: there is no doubt that the moral consciousness of a plain\nman broadly repudiates the general notion of an esoteric morality,\ndiffering from the one popularly taught; and it would be commonly\nagreed that an action which would be bad if done openly is not\nrendered good by secrecy. We may observe, however, that there are\nstrong utilitarian reasons for maintaining generally this latter\ncommon opinion\u2026. Thus the Utilitarian conclusion, carefully\nstated, would seem to be this; that the opinion that secrecy may\nrender an action right which would not otherwise be so should itself\nbe kept comparatively secret; and similarly it seems expedient that\nthe doctrine that esoteric morality is expedient should itself be kept\nesoteric. \u2026 a Utilitarian may reasonably desire, on Utilitarian\nprinciples, that some of his conclusions should be rejected by mankind\ngenerally; or even that the vulgar should keep aloof from his system\nas a whole, in so far as the inevitable indefiniteness and complexity\nof its calculations render it likely to lead to bad results in their\nhands. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 489\u201390])\n\n\nSuch provocative remarks, which flatly contradict any Kantian\ninsistence on the necessary publicity of fundamental moral principles,\nmay reflect a consistent interpretation of the different\n\u201clevels\u201d of moral thinking, critical versus everyday, but\nthey have generated much criticism, with Williams insinuating that\nSidgwick was a \u201cGovernment House\u201d utilitarian whose views\ncomported well with colonialism (Williams 1995). Yet even on the count\nof esoteric morality, Sidgwick\u2019s views have attracted some\nforceful recent defenders (de Lazari-Radek & Singer 2010, 2014,\n2016) who strike at the very heart of the Kantian and neo-Kantian\npublicity requirement. Their argument owes much to Parfit\u2019s\ndemonstration that an ethical theory could be self-effacing without\nbeing self-defeating, incoherent or untrue (Parfit 1984).\n\nAs noted, however, for all his originality, Sidgwick has often been\ncharged with slanting his discussion against a wide range of\nalternatives (Donagan 1977, 1992; Irwin 1992, 2007, 2011; Hurka\n2014b). And at times it is very far from clear whose views he is\ncriticizing. Thus, his account of \u201caesthetic intuitionism\u201d\nwould seem to be trained on a certain form of Aristotelianism\nstressing the contextual and particularist nature of practical wisdom\n(McDowell 1979; Irwin 1992), but, in a curiously neglected work on the\nhistory of ethics that was in some ways a successor to\nSidgwick\u2019s own Outlines (and contained an extended\ntreatment of Sidgwick\u2019s views), Reginald A. P. Rogers identified\naesthetic intuitionism with the moral sense theory of Shaftesbury\n(Rogers 1911). Furthermore, of special concern to recent intuitionists\nhas been the effort to combine Sidgwick\u2019s views with those of\nRoss on prima facie intuitions, acknowledging that\nSidgwick\u2019s account of intuitional morality did not address such\nan option (Hurka 2014a, 2014b; Crisp 2015). Hurka has developed this\ncritique forcefully, expanding on his claim that Sidgwick\u2019s\nframing of ethical theory was slanted from the start: Sidgwick\n\n\ntook it to be a serious objection to a pluralist deontology that it\ncannot always judge acts determinately because it cannot weigh duties\nprecisely, but no objection to hedonistic theories that they cannot\ncompare pleasures precisely. He tested deotontological principles\nrigorously with his four conditions but barely applied those\nconditions to his own principles. And though one of his main\nobjections to deontological principles turned on the difference\nbetween their other-things-equal and all-things-considered forms, his\ndefence of his axioms equivocated on the same point and involved the\nsame ambiguity. In arguing against deontology and for consequentialism\nhe applied, and not just once, a double standard. (Hurka 2014b:\n151\u20132)\n\n\nFor others, however, it is clear enough that Sidgwick\u2019s\nhedonistic utilitarianism does not require any Rossian apparatus for\nrecognizing apparent conflicts of duties. De Lazari-Radek and Singer,\nin response to Crisp\u2019s defense of Rossian prima facie\nintuitions, argue that \n\n\nRoss starts by assuming that, as he puts it, \u201cthe main moral\nconvictions of the plain man\u201d are \u201cnot opinions which it\nis for philosophy to prove or disprove, but knowledge from the\nstart\u201d. As we have already indicated both in our book and in\nthis response, we are skeptical about the validity of most of our\nmoral intuitions. (Singer & de Lazari-Radek 2016) \n\n\nAs Crisp allows, Sidgwick would probably not have deemed the Rossian\ngambit to the point for purposes of dealing with the problems that\nmost troubled him.\n\nMore generally, it must be said that Sidgwick, under the influence of\nHegel and other historically-minded philosophers, did not claim that\nhe was impartially addressing all historically important methods of\nethics, but only those that in his estimate had become the live\noptions as humanity had progressed (Schultz 2013; Phillips 2022). He\nmay have been somewhat misguided in identifying those, but that is not\nthe same as being blind to the content of the alternatives.\n\nAt any rate, fair or not, Sidgwick\u2019s reconciliation of\nintuitional morality and utilitarianism obviously deploys a\nsophisticated form of intuitionist epistemology, one allowing for the\nfallibilism of its conclusions. He formulates four criteria or\nconditions \n\n\nthe complete fulfillment of which would establish a significant\nproposition, apparently self-evident, in the highest degree of\ncertainty attainable: and which must be approximately realised by the\npremises of our reasoning in any inquiry, if that reasoning is to lead\nus cogently to trustworthy conclusions. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 338])\n\n\n\nThe first, often called simply the \u201cCartesian Criterion\u201d,\ndemands that the \u201cterms of the proposition must be clear and\nprecise\u201d, and the second requires that the \u201cself-evidence\nof the proposition must be ascertained by careful reflection\u201d,\nwhich is especially important in ethics because \n\n\nany strong sentiment, however purely subjective, is apt to transform\nitself into the semblance of an intuition; and it requires careful\ncontemplation to detect the illusion. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 339]) \n\n\nThird, the \u201cpropositions accepted as self-evident must be\nmutually consistent\u201d, since it \u201cis obvious that any\ncollision between two intuitions is a proof that there is error in one\nor the other, or in both\u201d. (Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 341]). And\nfourth, since \n\n\nit is implied in the very notion of Truth that it is essentially the\nsame for all minds, the denial by another of a proposition that I have\naffirmed has a tendency to impair my confidence in its validity. \n\n\nThis last adds an important social dimension to Sidgwick\u2019s\nepistemology: \n\n\nthe absence of such disagreement must remain an indispensable negative\ncondition of the certainty of our beliefs, \n\n\nfor \n\n\nif I find any of my judgements, intuitive or inferential, in direct\nconflict with a judgment of some other minds, there must be error\nsomewhere: and if I have no more reason to suspect error in the other\nmind than in my own, reflective comparison between the two judgments\nnecessarily reduces me temporarily to a state of neutrality. (Sidgwick\n1874 [1907: 341\u201342]) \n\n\nIn other, more purely epistemological works, Sidgwick collapsed the\nfirst two conditions into one, such that his philosophical\nintuitionism involved the three-pronged demand for clarity and ability\nto withstand critical reflection, consistency or coherence, and\nconsensus of experts. He was also apt to explain that these conditions\nonly afforded the best means for reducing the risk of error, rather\nthan establishing indubitable truth. On this count, such posthumous\nworks as Lectures on the Philosophy of Kant (1905) and\nPhilosophy, Its Scope and Relations (1902) provide important\nsupplements to the Methods. Marcus G. Singer (2000) provides\nan excellent edited collection of those of Sidgwick\u2019s essays and\nreviews most relevant to the Methods. Unfortunately, much\notherwise excellent work on Sidgwick\u2019s intuitionism has been\ncompromised by a failure to recognize the significance of these other\nworks.\n",
