Cyclic Families \u2217370\u2013\u2217375\n\n\n\nA fourth volume on geometry was begun but never completed (Russell\n1959: 99).\n\nOverall, the three volumes not only represent a major leap forward\nwith regard to modern logic, they are also rich in early\ntwentieth-century mathematical developments. To give one example,\nWhitehead and Russell were the first to define a series as a set of\nterms having the properties of being asymmetrical, transitive and\nconnected (1912 [1927: 497]). To give another, it is in\nPrincipia that we find the first detailed development of a\ngeneralized version of Cantor\u2019s transfinite ordinals, which the\nauthors call \u201crelation-numbers\u201d. The resulting\n\u201crelation-arithmetic\u201d in turn led to significant\nimprovements in our understanding of the general notion of structure\n(1912: Part IV).\n\nAs T.S. Eliot points out, the book also did a great deal to promote\nclarity in the use of ordinary language in the early part of the\ntwentieth century:\n\n\nhow much the work of logicians has done to make of English a language\nin which it is possible to think clearly and exactly on any subject.\nThe Principia Mathematica are perhaps a greater contribution\nto our language than they are to mathematics. (1927: 291)\n\n\nThe book is also not without some self-deprecating humour. As\nBlackwell points out (2011: 158, 160), the authors twice poke fun at\nthe length and tedium of the project\u2019s many logical derivations.\nIn Volume I, the authors explain that one cannot list all the\nnon-intensional functions of \\(\\phi \\bang \\hat{z}\\) \u201cbecause\nlife is too short\u201d (1910 [1925: 73]); and in Volume 3, after\nover 1,800 pages of dense symbolism, the authors end Part IV, Section\nD, on Cyclic Families, with the comment,\n\n\nWe have given proofs rather shortly in this Section, particularly in\nthe case of purely arithmetical lemmas, of which the proofs are\nperfectly straightforward, but tedious if written out at length. (1913\n[1927: 461])\n\n\nEvidence that the humour originates more with Russell than with\nWhitehead is perhaps found in not dissimilar remarks that appear in\nRussell\u2019s other writings. Russell\u2019s comment when\ndiscussing the axiom of choice, to the effect that given a collection\nof sets, it is possible to \u201cpick out a representative\narbitrarily from each of them, as is done in a General Election\u201d\n(1959: 92), is perhaps a case in point.\n\nReaders today (i.e., those who have learned logic in the last few\ndecades of the twentieth century or later) will find the book\u2019s\nnotation somewhat antiquated. Readers wanting assistance are advised\nto consult the entry on the\n notation in Principia Mathematica.\n Even so, the book remains one of the great scientific documents of\nthe twentieth century.\n",
