How well a\ntheory performs any of these tasks need not depend upon the truth or\naccuracy of its basic principles. Thus according to Osiander\u2019s\npreface to Copernicus\u2019 On the Revolutions, a locus\nclassicus, astronomers \u201c\u2026 cannot in any way attain to true\ncauses\u201d of the regularities among observable astronomical\nevents, and must content themselves with saving the phenomena in the\nsense of using\n\n\u2026 whatever suppositions enable \u2026 [them] to be computed\ncorrectly from the principles of geometry for the future as well as\nthe past \u2026 (Osiander 1543, XX)\n\n\nTheorists are to use those assumptions as calculating tools without\ncommitting themselves to their truth. In particular, the assumption\nthat the planets revolve around the sun must be evaluated solely in\nterms of how useful it is in calculating their observable relative\npositions to a satisfactory approximation. Pierre Duhem\u2019s\nAim and Structure of Physical Theory articulates a related\nconception. For Duhem a physical theory\n\n\u2026 is a system of mathematical propositions, deduced from a small\nnumber of principles, which aim to represent as simply and completely,\nand exactly as possible, a set of experimental laws. (Duhem 1906, 19)\n\n\n\u2018Experimental laws\u2019 are general, mathematical descriptions\nof observable experimental results. Investigators produce them by\nperforming measuring and other experimental operations and assigning\nsymbols to perceptible results according to pre-established\noperational definitions (Duhem 1906, 19). For Duhem, the main function\nof a physical theory is to help us store and retrieve information\nabout observables we would not otherwise be able to keep track of. If\nthat is what a theory is supposed to accomplish, its main virtue\nshould be intellectual economy. Theorists are to replace reports of\nindividual observations with experimental laws and devise higher level\nlaws (the fewer, the better) from which experimental laws (the more,\nthe better) can be mathematically derived (Duhem 1906, 21ff).\n\nA theory\u2019s experimental laws can be tested for accuracy and\ncomprehensiveness by comparing them to observational data. Let EL be\none or more experimental laws that perform acceptably well on such\ntests. Higher level laws can then be evaluated on the basis of how\nwell they integrate EL into the rest of the theory. Some data that\ndon\u2019t fit integrated experimental laws won\u2019t be\ninteresting enough to worry about. Other data may need to be\naccommodated by replacing or modifying one or more experimental laws\nor adding new ones. If the required additions, modifications or\nreplacements deliver experimental laws that are harder to integrate,\nthe data count against the theory. If the required changes are\nconducive to improved systematization the data count in favor of it.\nIf the required changes make no difference, the data don\u2019t argue\nfor or against the theory.\n",
