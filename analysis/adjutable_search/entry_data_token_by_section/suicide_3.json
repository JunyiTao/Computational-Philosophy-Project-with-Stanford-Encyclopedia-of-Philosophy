    "main_text": "Highlights of Historical Western Thought || The Christian Prohibition\n2.2 The Christian Prohibition\n\nThe advent of institutional Christianity was perhaps the most\nimportant event in the philosophical history of suicide, for Christian\ndoctrine has by and large held that suicide is morally wrong, despite\nthe absence of clear Scriptural guidance regarding suicide. Although\nthe early church fathers opposed suicide, St. Augustine is generally\ncredited with offering the first justification of the Christian\nprohibition on suicide (Amundsen 1989). He saw the prohibition as a\nnatural extension of the fifth commandment:\n\nGod\u2019s command \u2018Thou shalt not kill,\u2019 is to be taken\nas forbidding self-destruction, especially as it does not add\n\u2018thy neighbor\u2019, as it does when it forbids false witness,\n\u2018Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\u2019\n(Augustine, book I, chapter 20)\n\n\nSuicide, Augustine determined, was an unrepentable sin. St. Thomas\nAquinas later defended this prohibition on three grounds. (1) Suicide\nis contrary to natural self-love, whose aim is to preserve us. (2)\nSuicide injures the community of which an individual is a part. (3)\nSuicide violates our duty to God because God has given us life as a\ngift and in taking our lives we violate His right to determine the\nduration of our earthly existence (Aquinas 1271, part II, Q64, A5).\nThis conclusion was codified in the medieval doctrine that suicide\nnullified human beings\u2019 relationship to God, for our control\nover our body was limited to usus (possession, employment)\nwhere God retained dominium (dominion, authority). Law and\npopular practice in the Middle Ages sanctioned the desecration of the\nsuicidal corpse, along with confiscation of the individual\u2019s\nproperty and denial of Christian burial.\n\nThe rediscovery of numerous texts of classical antiquity was one of\nthe spurs of the Renaissance, but for the most part, Renaissance\nintellectuals generally affirmed the Church\u2019s opposition to\nsuicide and were not sympathetic to the more permissive attitudes\ntoward suicide found among the ancient pagans. Two intriguing\nsixteenth century exceptions were Thomas More and Michel de Montaigne.\nIn his Utopia, More appears to recommend voluntary suicide\nfor those suffering from painful and incurable diseases, though the\nsatirical and fantastical tone of that work makes it doubtful that\nMore supported this proposal in reality. In his Essais,\nMontaigne relates several anecdotes of individuals taking their own\nlives and intersperses these anecdotes with quotations from Roman\nwriters praising suicide. While his general skepticism prevented\nMontaigne from staking out a firm moral position on suicide, he gives\nonly a nod to the orthodox Christian position and conceptualizes the\nissue not in traditional theological terms but as a matter of personal\njudgment or conscience (Minois 1999, 89\u201392).\n\nThe Protestant Reformers, including Calvin, condemned suicide as\nroundly as did the established Church, but held out the possibility of\nGod treating suicide mercifully and permitting repentance. Interest in\nmoral questions concerning suicide was particularly strong in this\nperiod among England\u2019s Protestants, notably the Puritans (Sprott\n1961). Nonetheless, the traditional Christian view prevailed well into\nthe late seventeenth century, where even an otherwise liberal thinker\nsuch as John Locke echoed earlier Thomistic arguments, claiming that\nthough God bestowed upon us our natural personal liberty, that liberty\ndoes not include the liberty to destroy oneself (Locke 1690, ch. 2,\npara. 6).\n\nIn all likelihood, the first comprehensive modern defense of suicide\nwas John Donne\u2019s Biathanatos (c. 1607). Not intended\nfor publication, Biathanatos drew upon an array of classical\nand modern legal and theological sources to argue that Christian\ndoctrine should not hold that suicide is necessarily sinful. His\ncritique is in effect internal, drawing upon the logic of Christian\nthought itself to suggest that suicide is not contrary to the laws of\nnature, of reason, or of God. Were it contrary to the law of nature\nmandating self-preservation, all acts of self-denial or privation\nwould be similarly unlawful. Moreover, there may be circumstances in\nwhich reason might recommend suicide. Finally, Donne observes, not\nonly does Biblical Scripture lack a clear condemnation of suicide,\nChristian doctrine has permitted other forms of killing such as\nmartyrdom, capital punishment and killing in wartime (Minois 1999,\n20\u201321).\n",
