    "main_text": "\n\n \nAll histories of Jewish philosophy include an entry on Abraham Ibn\nEzra, and, judging from his impact on the field, he certainly deserves\nthe recognition that he has received. Just how he earned it, however,\nposes a difficult historical problem. Ibn Ezra contributed virtually\nnothing to any of the branches of philosophy; he authored little in\nthe way of strictly philosophical tracts and, indeed, there is no\nreason for us to suppose that he enjoyed any rigorous training in\nphilosophy.  Yet he certainly left his mark on Jewish thought, and his\npronouncements are recorded and treated with respect by those who came\nafter him.\n\n\nIbn Ezra\u2019s philosophical legacy consists in the main of the following,\nrather short list of doctrines. The deity governs the terrestrial\nworld by means of the heavenly bodies. Humans toil under astral\ndestiny; though the stars are subservient, formally at least, to God,\ntheir domination over the material universe is for all practical\npurposes complete. Neither the precise structure of the human soul,\nnor the mode of its bonding with the body, may be known with\ncertainty.  However, one component or aspect of the human soul is of\nthe same fiber as the supernal realm that is above the stars; nothing\nin existence is more similar to God. Nurturing this spiritual\ncomponent offers the one hope of refuge from this world. Ibn Ezra\u2019s\npoetry in particular gives very powerful expression to the themes of\nthe soul\u2019s alienation and longing to return to its heavenly abode. To\nbe sure, weighty questions are involved in all of these teachings, but\nIbn Ezra does not take any of them up in depth.\n\n\nIn sum, it appears that Ibn Ezra, much like Sa\u2018adiah\u2014the\nJewish thinker who probably influenced him most strongly\u2014adopted a mix of\nkalam and philosophical doctrines. There simply is no evidence that he\ntrained in philosophy or studied anything more than a small sampling\nof the literature available in his day, which was considerable. His\nacknowledged sources are nearly all brief, gaonic, writings, which\ndisplay the first grapplings of medieval Jewry with theological\nissues.\n\n\nNonetheless, Ibn Ezra achieved the status of the sage whose remarks,\ncurt and enigmatic though they may be, carry weight and authority. In\na way, his role in philosophy, or, perhaps better put, in spreading\ncertain philosophical teachings, is not that different from the one he\nplayed in mathematics, astronomy, and astrology. His copious writings\non those subjects are not distinguished by any depth or originality;\nyet there can be no doubt that their role was pivotal in the spread of\nknowledge throughout Europe, most especially within the Jewish\ncommunities, though by no means limited to them. While not pretending\nto offer a complete and completely satisfying answer, we suggest a\ncombination of factors that facilitated his success: industriousness,\nwide travels, the very popular vehicle of bible commentary, rational\nthought that gives a prominent place to astrology, and a soteriology\nthat focuses upon the individual rather than the collective.\n",
