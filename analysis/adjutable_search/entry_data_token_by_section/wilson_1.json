    "main_text": "Ancient Philosophy\n2. Ancient Philosophy\n\nCook Wilson published over 50 papers in Ancient philosophy, in\nscholarly journals such as Classical Review, Classical\nQuarterly, Transactions of the Oxford Philological\nSociety and Philologische Rundschau, and a few\nbook-length studies on Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics\n(AS) and on Plato\u2019s Timaeus. His main philological\nclaim concerning the structure of the seventh book of Nicomachean\nEthics was that it contained traces of three versions probably\nwritten by some Peripatetic later than Eudemus. To this he added a\nyear later a discussion (ASV) of interpolations in\nCategories, Posterior Analytics and Eudemian\nEthics. In a postscript to the revised version of AS (1912), he\nclaimed, however, that the variants were probably different drafts\nwritten by Aristotle himself. His pamphlet on the Timaeus\n(IPT) was mainly polemical, painstakingly detailing R. D.\nArcher-Hind\u2019s \u2018obligations\u2019 in his 1888 edition of\nthe Timaeus to earlier authors, J. G. Stallbaum more than any\nother.\n\nCook Wilson is mainly remembered today for two contributions to Plato\nstudies, foremost for his paper \u2018On the Platonist Doctrine of\nthe \u1f00\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\n\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u2019 (OPD), which bears\non the debate on \u2018intermediates\u2019 in Plato. This issue\noriginates in Aristotle\u2019s claim in Met. A 6\n987b14\u201317 that Plato believed that the objects of mathematics\noccupy an \u201cintermediate position\u201d between sensible things\nand Ideas/Forms. Since there is no explicit commitment to this claim\nin Plato, scholars either rejected Aristotle\u2019s testimony or\nlooked for passages where Plato might be said to have implicitly\nendorsed it, such as the Line at the end of Book VI of the\nRepublic. Cook Wilson argued against reading this passage as\nimplicitly endorsing \u2018intermediates\u2019, claiming that\nobjects of thought (\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1) are\nIdeas, because Plato stated in Rep. 511d2\u20133 that they\nare \u201cintelligible given a principle\u201d\n(\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\n\u03bd\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f42\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u2019 \u1f00\u03c1\u03ba\u1fc6\u03c2), and, as\nCook Wilson saw the matter: \u201cnothing but an\n\u03b9\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1 can be an object of\n\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2\u201d (OPD, 259).\n\nHe also argued that universals being \u2018one\u2019 in contrast\nwith the \u2018many\u2019 to which they correspond, there could be\nonly one \u2018Circularity\u2019, one \u2018number Two\u2019, etc.\nThis means that, for example, \u2018the number Two\u2019 or the\nuniversal \u2018twoness\u2019 being one, it cannot be a plurality\ncomposed of units and thus that \u2018two and two make four\u2019 is\nnot an addition of universals such as \u2018twoness and twoness make\nfourness\u2019 or \u2018the number Two added to the number Two makes\nthe number Four\u2019. These expressions have no sense according to\nCook Wilson, for whom \u2018two and two make four\u2019 merely means\nthat \u2018any two things added to any other two things make four\nthings\u2019 (OPD, 249). This is why numbers qua universals\nare \u2018unaddible\u2019 or \u2018uncombinable\u2019\n(\u1f00\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9) as\nAristotle put it in, e.g., Met. M 8 1083a34, a view that Cook\nWilson takes to be \u201cexactly the Platonic doctrine\u201d (OPD,\n250).\n\nThe need to posit \u2018intermediates\u2019 can be seen as arising\nfrom the fact that one cannot perform arithmetical operations on these\n\u2018Idea numbers\u2019, as Cook Wilson called them, while one\nwould need entities that are \u2018in between\u2019 (\u03c4\u03ac\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03cd) sensible things and Idea numbers\nto account for arithmetical truths as elementary as \u2018two and two\nmake four\u2019. Cook Wilson nevertheless argued against commitment\nto \u2018intermediates\u2019 (OPD, \u00a74), his view being that\narithmetical operations are always on particulars and if the\n\u2018monadic numbers\u2019 of arithmetic are plurality of units,\nIdea numbers are properties of these numbers. That Plato had reached\nthis view of Idea numbers as\n\u1f00\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03b2\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\n\u1f00\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03af at the time he wrote the\nRepublic or later on would be yet another issue.\n\nCook Wilson also argued (OPD, \u00a75) that Idea numbers form a series\nordered by a relation of \u2018before and after\u2019\n(\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76\n\u1f54\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd) and, following\nAristotle\u2019s testimony in Eth. Nic. I 6,\n1096a17\u201319 and Met. B 3, 999a6\u201314, that there\ncould be no genus of the species forming such ordered series (for a\ncritique of this reading of Aristotle, see Lloyd (1962)). In other\nwords, there can be no Form or universal of the Idea numbers. He would\nthus claim that in the proposition \u2018The number Two is a\nuniversal\u2019, the expression \u2018a universal\u2019 cannot\ndenote in turn a particularization of \u2018universalness\u2019,\nbecause the latter is not a true universal as it lacks an\n\u201cintrinsic character\u201d (SI, 342 n.1 & 351), and this he\ntook to be the point of Plato\u2019s doctrine of \u201cunaddible\nnumbers\u201d (SI, 352).\n\nCook Wilson not only believed that these views are the true\ninterpretation of Plato, but also that they are true\nsimpliciter and he criticized Dedekind\u2019s definition of\ncontinuity in Stetigkeit und die irrationale Zahlen (Dedekind\n1872) for \u201cnot realising the truth attained so long ago in Greek\nphilosophy that [numbers] are Universals\u201d and not magnitudes\n(OPD, 250, n.1 & SI, ciii) (Joseph 1948, 59\u201360). He never\nexplained in any details how this critique is supposed to work against\nDedekind, but provided instead lengthy and unconvincing arguments for\nalso rejecting Russell\u2019s logicist definition of natural numbers\non similar ground (see section 8).\n\nDespite the fact that he drew such preposterous consequences from it,\nCook Wilson\u2019s reading of Plato and Aristotle in OPD remained\ninfluential, albeit controversial, throughout the last century,\nthrough Ross\u2019 edition of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\n(1924, liii\u2013lvii, ad B 3, 999a6\u201310 & M 6,\n1080a15\u2013b4) and especially through its advocacy by Harold\nCherniss in Aristotle\u2019s Criticism of Plato and the\nAcademy (Cherniss 1944, App. vi) and The Riddle of the Early\nAcademy (Cherniss 1945, 34\u201337 & 76). Cherniss\u2019\nstudent Reginald Allen still claimed in the 1980s that Cook\nWilson\u2019s is the \u201ctrue view of Plato\u2019s\narithmetic\u201d (Allen 1983, 231\u2013233). (For further\nendorsements of Cook Wilson\u2019s reading see (Joseph 1948, 33 &\nchap. v), (Klein 1968, 62) or (Tar\u00e1n 1981, 13\u201318) and for\ncriticisms see (Hardie 1936, chap. vi), (Austin 1979, 302) or\n(Burnyeat 2012, 166\u2013167).)\n\nCook Wilson\u2019s other notable contribution is the provision, in\n\u2018On the Geometrical Problem in Plato\u2019s Meno, 86e\nsqq.\u2019 (GPP), of a key addition to S. H. Butcher\u2019s\nclarification (1888) of the notoriously obscure geometrical\nillustration of Meno 86e\u201387b, showing that Plato did\nnot intend to offer an actual solution to the problem of the\ninscription of an area as a triangle within a circle, but simply to\ndetermine, while alluding to the method of analysis, the possibility\nof its solution. An analogous explanation of that passage was provided\nlater on by T. L. Heath (1921, 298\u2013303) and A. S. L. Farquharson\n(1923), while Knorr (1986, 71\u201374) and Menn (2002, 209\u2013214)\ndefended this interpretation without mention of Cook Wilson. (See also\nthe critical discussion of the \u2018Cook Wilson/Heath/Knorr\ninterpretation\u2019 in (Lloyd 1992), as well as (Scott 2006,\n133\u2013137) and (Wolfsdorf 2008, 164\u2013169).)\n\nApart from these, Cook Wilson\u2019s impact seems to have been\nlimited to minute points of philology, such as the references to his\ncritical comments on Apelt\u2019s edition of De Melisso Xenophane\nGorgia (APT) in (Kerferd 1955) or to his pamphlet on the\nTimaeus in A. E. Taylor\u2019s and F. M. Cornford\u2019s\nown commentaries of that dialogue, and the critical discussion of his\nviews in Ross\u2019 edition of Aristotle\u2019s Prior and\nPosterior Analytics (Ross 1949, 496\u2013497).\n\nGiven that Cook Wilson\u2019s views on knowledge and belief (see\nsection 5) are linked to Plato\u2019s own distinction between\n\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b7 and\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b1, it is worth mentioning that they also had an\nimpact on the study of Plato\u2019s dialogues. For example, although\nA. D. Woozley held a different view of knowledge as \u201cnot\nsomething generically different from belief, but as the limited case\nof belief\u201d (Woozley 1949, 193), Cook Wilson\u2019s distinction\nbetween knowledge and belief is introduced as an interpretative tool\nin chapter 8 of R. C. Cross and A. D. Woozley, Plato\u2019s\nRepublic. A Philosophical Commentary (Cross & Woozley 1964),\nwhile the idea that knowledge involves \u2018reflection\u2019 (the\n\u2018accretion\u2019 described in section 5) and the concept of\n\u2018being under the impression that\u2019 are involved in\nRyle\u2019s discussion of knowledge in Plato\u2019s\nTheaetetus (Ryle 1990, 23 & 27\u201328). (For a similar\nclaim about Theaetetus, see Prichard (1950, 88), and for Ryle\non Cook Wilson on Parmenides, see end of section 7.) The\nimpact of Cook Wilson\u2019s views was at any rate not limited to\nPlato studies: they form, for example, the basis for H. A.\nPrichard\u2019s critique of Kant in his Kant\u2019s\nTheory of Knowledge (Prichard 1909) or of his lectures on the\nDescartes, Locke, Berkeley and Hume on knowledge (Prichard 1950, chap.\n5). (See in particular Prichard (1909, 245), quoted below or (1950,\n86, 88 & 96) for statements of the distinction between knowledge\nand belief.)\n",
