    "main_text": "A Bounded Utility Function?\n4. A Bounded Utility Function?\n\nArrow (1970: 92) suggests that the utility function of a rational\nagent should be \u201ctaken to be a bounded function.\u2026 since\nsuch an assumption is needed to avoid [the St. Petersburg]\nparadox\u201d. Basset (1987) makes a similar point; see also\nSamuelson (1977) and McClennen (1994).\n\nArrow\u2019s point is that utilities must be bounded to avoid the St.\nPetersburg paradox and that traditional axiomatic accounts of the\nexpected utility principle guarantee this to be the case. The\nwell-known axiomatizations proposed by Ramsey (1926), von Neumann and\nMorgenstern (1947), and Savage (1954) do, for instance, all entail\nthat the decision maker\u2019s utility function is bounded. (See\n section 2.3 in the entry on decision theory\n for an overview of von Neumann and Morgenstern\u2019s\naxiomatization.)\n\nIf the utility function is bounded, then the expected utility of the\nSt. Petersburg game will of course be finite. But why do the axioms of\nexpected utility theory guarantee that the utility function is\nbounded? The crucial assumption is that rationally permissible\npreferences over lotteries are continuous. To explain the\nsignificance of this axiom it is helpful to introduce some symbols.\nLet \\(\\{pA, (1-p)B\\}\\) be the lottery that results in A with\nprobability p and B with probability \\(1-p\\). The\nexpression \\(A\\preceq B\\) means that the agent considers B to\nbe at least as good as A, i.e., weakly prefers B to\nA. Moreover, \\(A\\sim B\\) means that A and B are\nequi-preferred, and \\(A\\prec B\\) means that B is preferred to\nA. Consider:\n\n\nThe Continuity Axiom: Suppose \\(A \\preceq B\\preceq C\\).\nThen there is a probability \\(p\\in [0,1]\\) such that \\(\\{pA,\n(1-p)C\\}\\sim B\\).\n\n\n\nTo explain why this axiom entails that no object can have infinite\nvalue, suppose for reductio that A is a prize check\nworth $1, B is a check worth $2, and C is a prize to\nwhich the agent assigns infinite utility. The decision maker\u2019s\npreference is \\(A\\prec B\\prec C\\), but there is no probability\np such that \\(\\{pA, (1-p)C\\sim B\\). Whenever p is\nnonzero the decision maker will strictly prefer \\(\\{pA, (1-p)C\\}\\) to\nB, and if p is 0 the decision maker will strictly prefer\nB. So because no object (lottery or outcome) can have infinite\nvalue, and a utility function is defined by the utilities it assigns\nto those objects (lotteries or outcomes), the utility function has to\nbe bounded.\n\nDoes this solve the St. Petersburg paradox? The answer depends on\nwhether we think a rational agent offered to play the St. Petersburg\ngame has any reason to accept the continuity axiom. A possible view is\nthat anyone who is offered to play the St. Petersburg game has reason\nto reject the continuity axiom. Because the St. Petersburg game has\ninfinite utility, the agent has no reason to evaluate lotteries in the\nmanner stipulated by this axiom. As explained in Section 3, we can\nimagine unboundedly valuable payoffs.\n\nSome might object that the continuity axiom, as well as the other\naxioms proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern (and Ramsey and\nSavage), are essential for defining utility in a\nmathematically precise manner. It would therefore be\nmeaningless to talk about utility if we reject the continuity\naxiom. This axiom is part of what it means to say that something has a\nhigher utility than something else. A good response could be to\ndevelop a theory of utility in which preferences over lotteries are\nnot used for defining the meaning of the concept; see Luce (1959) for\nan early example of such a theory. Another response could be to\ndevelop a theory of utility in which the continuity axiom is\nexplicitly rejected; see Skala (1975).\n",
