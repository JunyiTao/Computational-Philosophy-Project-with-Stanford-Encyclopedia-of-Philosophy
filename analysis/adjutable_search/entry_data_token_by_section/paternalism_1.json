    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues\n2. Conceptual Issues\n\nThe analysis of paternalism involves at least the following elements.\nIt involves some kind of limitation on the freedom or autonomy of some\nagent and it does so for a particular class of reasons. As with many\nother concepts used in normative debate determining the exact\nboundaries of the concept is a contested issue. \n\nAnd as often is the case the first question is whether the concept\nitself is normative or descriptive. Is application of the concept a\nmatter for empirical determination, so that if two people disagree\nabout the application to a particular case they are disagreeing about\nsome matter of fact or of definition? Or does their disagreement\nreflect different views about the legitimacy of the application in\nquestion?\n\nWhile it is clear that for some to characterize a policy as\npaternalistic is to condemn or criticize it, that does not establish\nthat the term itself is an evaluative one. As a matter of methodology\nit is preferable to see if some concept can be defined in\nnon-normative terms and only if that fails to capture the relevant\nphenomena to accept a normative definition.\n\nI suggest the following conditions as an analysis of X acts\npaternalistically towards Y by doing (omitting)\nZ:\n\nZ (or its omission) interferes with the liberty or autonomy\nof Y.\nX does so without the consent of Y.\nX does so only because X believes Z will\nimprove the welfare of Y (where this includes preventing his\nwelfare from diminishing), or in some way promote the interests,\nvalues, or good of Y.\n\n\nCondition one is the trickiest to capture. Clear cases include\nthreatening bodily compulsion, lying, withholding information that the\nperson has a right to have, or imposing requirements or conditions.\nBut what about the following case? A father, skeptical about the\nfinancial acumen of a child, instead of bequeathing the money\ndirectly, gives it to another child with instructions to use it in the\nbest interests of the first child. The first child has no legal claim\non the inheritance. There does not seem to be an interference with the\nchild\u2019s liberty nor on most conceptions the child\u2019s\nautonomy.\n\nOr consider the case of a wife who hides her sleeping pills so that\nher potentially suicidal husband cannot use them. Her act may satisfy\nthe second and third conditions but what about the first? Does her\naction limit the liberty or autonomy of her husband?\n\nThe second condition is supposed to be read as distinct from acting\nagainst the consent of an agent. The agent may neither consent nor not\nconsent. He may, for example, be unaware of what is being done to him.\nThere is also the distinct issue of whether one acts not knowing about\nthe consent of the person in question. Perhaps the person in fact\nconsents but this is not known to the paternaliser.\n\nThe third condition also can be complicated. There may be more than\none reason for interfering with Y. In addition to concern for\nthe welfare of Y there may be concern for how Y\u2019s\nactions may affect third-parties. Is the \u201cjust for\u201d\ncondition too strong? Or what about the case where a legislature\npasses a legal rule for paternalistic reasons but there are sufficient\nnon-paternalistic reasons to justify passage of the rule? \n\nIf, in order to decide on any of the above issues, one must decide a\nnormative issue, e.g., does someone have a right to some information,\nthen the concept is not purely descriptive. Ultimately the question of\nhow to refine the conditions, and what conditions to use, is a matter\nfor philosophical judgment. The term \u201cpaternalism\u201d as used\nin ordinary contexts may be too amorphous for thinking about\nparticular normative issues. One should decide upon an analysis based\non a hypothesis of what will be most useful for thinking about a\nparticular range of problems. One might adopt one analysis in the\ncontext of doctors and patients and another in the context of whether\nthe state should ban unhealthy foods. \n\nGiven some particular analysis of paternalism there will be various\nnormative views about when paternalism is justified. The following\nterminology is useful.\n",
