Collective Responsibility and the Structure of Groups\n\nWhile Gilbert, May, List, Pettit, and others who concentrate on\nredeeming collective responsibility as an intellectual construct do so\nby defending the coherence of collective actions and group intentions,\nthey do not go as far as to assert that all kinds of groups are\ncapable of acting and intending collectively. Nor do they go as far as\nto assert that all kinds of groups can be understood as collectively\nresponsible for bringing about harm. Instead, they assert that only\nparticular kinds of groups are capable of acting and intending\ncollectively and that only particular kinds of groups are capable of\nbeing collectively responsible for harm. What kinds of groups are\nthese?\n\nThe most common approach taken to distinguishing between appropriate\nand inappropriate sites of collective responsibility has been to focus\non nations, corporations, and other groups that have well-ordered\ndecision-making procedures in place, since, it is argued, these groups\nare, by virtue of their well-ordered decision-making procedures, able\nto demonstrate two things that are often assumed to be necessary to\ncollective responsibility. The first is a set of group actions that\nhave an identifiable moral agent, e.g., a governing board or a\nrepresentative body, behind them capable of carrying out a group\naction. The second is a set of decisions that are made\nself-consciously on a rational basis\u2014or at least\npurposively\u2014by the group that take the form of group intentions\nor group choices.\n\nPeter French considers groups that are so organized to be especially\nappropriate sites of collective responsibility because of three\nsalient features that they all share. The first is a series of\norganizational mechanisms through which courses of concerted action\ncan be, though not necessarily are, chosen on a rational basis. The\nsecond is a set of enforced standards of conduct for individuals that\nare more stringent than those usually thought to apply in the larger\ncommunity of individuals, standards that enable us to talk about both\ngroup conduct and group discipline. The third is a configuration of\n\u201cdefined roles by which individuals can exercise certain powers\n\u201d (French 1984, pp. 13\u201314) All three of these features,\naccording to French, signal the existence of purposeful and controlled\nactions that are capable of rendering groups collectively responsible\nfor harm.\n\nA second approach to the location of appropriate sites of collective\nresponsibility has been to use groups such as ethnic communities,\nclubs, and social movements as paradigmatic cases of appropriate\ncollective responsibility on the grounds that these groups have\nmembers who share interests or needs in common. Two assumptions\nprevail here. The first is that groups whose members share interests\nor needs in common show signs of group solidarity, which Joel Feinberg\ndefines in this context as a matter of individuals taking a strong\ninterest in each others\u2019 interests (Feinberg 1968). The second\nis that groups that show signs of group solidarity understood in this\nway are capable of acting and intending in the sense relevant to\ncollective responsibility, since while they are made up of\nindividuals, they pursue projects together.\n\nNot surprisingly, group solidarity is generally thought to exist\nprimarily in either cases where group members identify themselves as\ngroup members and assert their shared interests and needs or in cases\nwhere group members exhibit collective consciousness to the extent\nthat they are inclined to take pride or feel shame in group actions\nwithout prompting. But, according to at least some of those who make\nuse of the concept of group solidarity here, e.g. Larry May (1987) and\nHoward McGary (1986), group solidarity does not require group\nself-consciousness. Indeed, according to both May and McGary, group\nsolidarity can be understood as present in what McGary calls\n\u201cloosely structured groups\u201d, such as privileged racial\ngroups whose members provide support or benefits to other members\nqua group members, even though they may not, in\nMcGary\u2019s words, \u201csee themselves as interested in one\nanother\u2019s interests\u201d (McGary 1986, p. 158). In these\ngroups, McGary contends, mutual benefits, as well as practices that\nmay, unbeknownst to those who participate in them, maintain forms of\noppression such as racism and sexism, signal group solidarity of the\nsort relevant to collective responsibility.\n\nA third approach here is to pick up on shared attitudes among\ngroup members as something that renders the group itself an\nappropriate site of collective responsibility. The attitudes taken to\nbe relevant here are generally those that both produce serious harm in\nsociety and that require acceptance by many individuals in a community\ntogether in order to be effective, e.g., attitudes such as racism,\nsexism, and anti-Semitism. May (1987), McGary (1986), Marilyn Friedman\n(Friedman and May 1985) and others cite these attitudes as enough to\nrender groups such as \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cwhite\nAmericans\u201d collectively responsible for the oppression of women\nand black Americans in some, but not all, cases. Other defenders of\ncollective responsibility, e.g., Peter French, refrain from going this\nfar on the grounds that the groups in question are not organized\nenough to be capable of sustaining a sense of moral agency that is\ngenuinely collective (French 1984).\n\nAll three of the above approaches take us in different directions.\nHence, they are sometimes thought to be competing. But they all rest\non a general distinction between aggregate and conglomerate\ncollectivities. An aggregate collectivity, Peter French writes, is\n\u201cmerely a collection of people\u201d (French 1984, p. 5). It is\nnot, from the perspective of most of those now writing on collective\nresponsibility, an appropriate site of collective responsibility. A\nconglomerate collectivity, on the other hand, is an\n\u201corganization of individuals such that its identity is not\nexhausted by the conjunction of the identities of the persons in the\norganization\u201d (French 1984, p. 13). It is, from the perspective\nof most of those now writing on collective responsibility, an\nappropriate site of collective responsibility, since, unlike an\naggregate collectivity, it supplies us with a moral agent capable of\npurposeful action.\n\nWhile most of those who defend collective responsibility as a moral\nconstruct adhere to this distinction in general, they do not all agree\non what counts as an aggregate collectivity in practice. Indeed, there\nis considerable disagreement among those now writing about collective\nresponsibility (including some who take the above three approaches)\nabout two particular kinds of groups that appear to some to be\naggregative groups. One of these kinds of groups is the mob. The other\nis what Virginia Held calls a \u201crandom collection of\nindividuals.\u201d Neither of these kinds of groups has a\ndecision-making procedure in place. Nor do their members show much\nsolidarity. Hence, they are usually rejected as candidates for\ncollective responsibility by many of those who otherwise find the\nnotion of collective responsibility to be very useful. But there are\nthose who put forward both groups as appropriate sites of collective\nresponsibility.\n\nVirginia Held (Held 1970) argues that members of an unorganized group\nmay be said to be responsible for not taking an action that could have\nprevented harm in cases where they could have done something to\nprevent the harm together but chose not to do so. Her particular\nexamples are those of victims of violence who are beaten or killed in\nfull sight of strangers assembled around them, strangers who are\nthemselves neither related to the victim nor there together as part of\nany group-based project. According to Held, while none of these\nindividuals may have been able to prevent the violence on their own,\nthey could have prevented it if they had organized themselves into a\ngroup, i.e., cooperated with at least some of the others. Hence, they\ncan as a group be blamed for the victims\u2019 suffering and/or\ndeath.\n\nHeld acknowledges here that holding a random collection of individuals\nresponsible for harm is more difficult than holding an organized group\nresponsible for it, since the latter, unlike the former, has a method\nfor deciding how to act, whether it is a voting procedure or a set of\nhierarchical authority relations. But, she argues, we can still hold\nthe former group, i.e., that which she calls a random collection of\nindividuals, responsible for the violence done to victims, since, if\nthey had tried, they could have come up with such decision-making\nprocedures themselves. \u201cIn the foregoing examples,\u201d she\nwrites, \u201cwe can say that the random collection of individuals\nwas morally responsible for failing to transform itself into an\norganized group capable of taking action rather than inaction\u201d\nwith respect to the prevention of harm. (Held 1970, p. 479.)\n\nMobs are often thought to be the last groups that we should be tying\nto hold collectively responsible. For, they completely lack\ndecision-making procedures, their members are seemingly not related,\nand they are often chaotic and irrational. But, Larry May (1987),\nRaimo Tuomela (1989), and others argue, we can nevertheless hold mobs\ncollectively responsible if at least some of their members contribute\ndirectly to harm and others either facilitate these contributions or\nfail to prevent them. For, in these cases, all mob members are\n\u201cimplicated\u201d in mob action, even if not all of them\nproduced specific harms or organized together to do so. Tuomela (1989,\n2005, 2006), much like Le Bon (1896) before him, argues that both\ncrowds and rioters are appropriate sites of collective responsibility\nby virtue of the fact that they perform their acts as members of a\ngroup, even if they do not think of themselves as doing so.\n\nCrowds and rioters \u2026 are without much or any structure (and\ndivisions of tasks and activities) \u2026 with respect to the goals\nand interests of the group. \u2026 But they can be said to act in\nvirtue of their members\u2019 actions. \u2026 Thus in a riot the\nmembers of the collective typically perform their destructive actions\nas members of a collective without acting on its behalf.\n(Tuomela 1989, p. 476.)\n\n\nInterestingly enough, in both of these cases\u2014mobs and what Held\ncalls random collections of individuals\u2014the groups in question\nmay not be as unrelated as Held and others suggest they are. Indeed,\nit may be precisely because these groups are made up of individuals\nwho become related to each other in the process of\nproducing harm together (even though they were initially strangers)\nthat they are now potentially appropriate sites of collective\nresponsibility. Stanley Bates suggests as much in his own arguments\nthat Held has presented us with a group that is neither as random nor\nas disconnected as the term \u201crandom\u201d normally suggests,\nbut that is \u201crelated\u201d to the extent that group whose\nmembers share a particular challenge and are capable of communicating\nwith one another (Bates 1971).\n\nTwo aspects of the debate about random collections have resurfaced in\nrecent years in two related debates about collective moral\nresponsibility. The first is the importance of group inaction\nwhen it comes to some cases of collective moral responsibility. The\nsecond is the ability of disorganized groups to constitute the kind of\nmoral agents that can be held morally responsible for not acting.\n\nThe matter of omissions turns out to be particularly challenging for\nthose who want to hold disorganized groups morally responsible for\nanything, since, as Joseph Metz (2021) points out, it is hard to see\nhow an individual contributes anything to a collective omission to\nprevent harm if she could not have made a difference to that\nharm\u2019s coming about (or at least not on her own). But, Metz\nargues, we can scale things up to a model of group capability and\npoint to the ability of a group of individuals who did nothing to,\nsay, prevent global warming, and use that ability to say that they\ncould have acted together to prevent the harm.\n\nMetz may well be right here. But the ability of a collective to\nprevent harm is only one condition of its collective responsibility in\ncases where the collective did not act. Also necessary is that the\ncollective have been morally expected to act.\n\nWhere do these moral expectations come from? The most commonly cited\nsource of them is a collective obligation on the\ncollective\u2019s part to prevent harm. David Copp (2020) underscores\nthe controversial nature of such an obligation and rightfully insists\nthat it be justified in general.\n\nNot surprisingly, a collective obligation to prevent harm is not all\nthat difficult to justify in the case of organized\ncollectives (whether we are talking about actions or omissions), since\nin these cases we can reference group identity, inter- and intra-\ngroup relationships, moral commitments, and promises, as well as\nexpediency. In Group Duties, Stephanie Collins (2019)\nexplores the various ways in which we might justify collective\nobligations in these cases; she also draws out the implications of\nthem for individual group members.\n\nIn \u201cHow Much Can We Ask of Collective Agents?\u201d, Collins\n(2020) goes on to explore the scope of collective obligations and\ndefends them against claims of over-demandedness.\n\nIn cases of yet-to-be-formed collectives, collective obligations are\nmore difficult to justify, since the contours of the collective are by\nnature fuzzy and there is no clear collective moral agent to be\npinpointed. But there have been efforts to justify collective\nobligations in these cases nevertheless. Interestingly enough, they\nhave generally focussed on group capacity. In Violetta\nIgneski\u2019s words (Igneski, 2020), \u201c[W]hen there is evidence\nthat a group of individuals has the capacity to prevent harm or a\nwrong and the individual members are aware (or should be aware) of\nthis, they have a duty, as a group, to prevent the harm or\nwrong\u201d (p. 447).\n\nAs we shall see in Section 7, things may not be quite so simple. For,\neven if a group has the capacity to act if organized, there are other\nfactors that need to be taken into consideration before we can posit a\ncollective obligation and make a subsequent claim of collective\nresponsibility. One of these considerations is whether the prevention\nof the particular case of harm in question ranks high on the list of\nthe many cases of harm prevention that require the group\u2019s\nattention in a situation where choices have to be made. Another is\nwhether, given other demands on the group, including the well being of\nthe group itself, it would be fair to expect the group to pursue this\nparticular project (and hence take it on as a collective\nobligation).\n\nMoreover, even in cases where we agree that the group should\ntake on the project as a collective obligation, we still face a\nfurther challenge, namely, that the groups we are talking about here\nare not (at this point) organized to the point where they can act.\nHence, even if we can expect them to act and they would be\nable to do so if they were organized, they are not at this point able\nto d oso. How, we have to ask, can we transform a disorganized\ncollective into one that is organized enough to be associated with a\ncollective obligation (and hence collective responsibility)? What\nmight motivate such a transformation? Igneski (2020) gestures to the\nplace of individual moral agents with duties of their own as a\nstarting point for getting the requisite collective organized. We\ndiscuss this possibility more fully in Section 7, where the\ntransformation in question becomes key to the coherence and\nworkability of forward looking collective responsibility.\n\nSuffice it to underscore two things here. First of all, when it comes\nto traditional, backward looking, collective responsibility, we need,\nat the very least, to be able to locate a group that is capable of\nbeing construed as a collective moral agent, that could have been\nexpected to prevent the harm in question (by virtue of, say, having a\ncollective obligation to do so), and that was capable of acting in the\nways required. Second, it is much easier for a collective that is\norganized to meet these conditions than a collective that is not.\nThird, in order for a collective that is not organized to meet these\nconditions, it may have to rely on individual members to organize it,\nindividual members who are motivated in some way to do so qua\nindividual moral agents.\n\nIn almost all of the above discussions of collective moral\nresponsibility, the groups being held morally responsible for harm are\nmade up of those individuals who either caused the harm themselves or\nrefrained from preventing it at the time it occurred. But in recent\nyears, a number of efforts have been made to hold groups morally\nresponsible for actions performed by earlier generations. The case of\nslavery tends to take center stage here and is often accompanied by\narguments for reparations. While such efforts have generally taken\nplace in the legal arena, they have not been excluded entirely from\ncontemporary philosophical discussions of collective responsibility.\nIndeed, in recent years, a variety of philosophers have set out to\nascribe moral responsibility to groups whose present members were not\neven alive when the bad actions in question were carried out, even\nthough, as Janna Thompson points out, \u201cnot being born when an\ninjustice took place seems to be a very good reason for denying any\nresponsibility\u201d (Thompson 2006, p. 155).\n\nHow can we possibly hope to hold groups morally responsible for the\nbad actions of previous generations? Farid Abdel-Nour (Abdel-Nour,\n2003) argues that community solidarity is sufficient to render at\nleast some kinds of groups morally responsible for the harms brought\nabout by earlier generations, especially if there is a high level of\ncross-generational identification and pride in one\u2019s\nancestors\u2019 deeds.\n\nNot surprisingly, these kinds of arguments run into trouble when\nquestions of agency arise. For, while the existence of solidarity and\nidentification may allow us to talk about a group over time and even\nlabel its actions morally wrong,they do not allow us to posit the kind\nof agency that is required of moral responsibility as traditionally\nunderstood. For, as Michael Bratman shows in his own work on\ncollective responsibility, the latter requires, not only that\nindividuals share intentions but that they interact. (See\nespecially Bratman 2000).\n\nWhile most of those writing on collective responsibility seem to agree\nwith Bratman here on the necessity of interaction, not all do. Linda\nRadzik (Radzik 2001) claims that we need only show that existing group\nmembers benefit from a past injustice to hold them responsible for it.\nLarry May makes similar claims throughout his work, including in his\narguments that men are collectively responsible for rape and whites in\nthe U.S. are collectively responsible for racism (May and Strikwerda\n1994).\n\nWhat place does benefiting from harm have in the ascription of\ncollective responsibility? As Janna Thompson (2002, 2006) points out,\nto benefit from a harm is not the same thing as to cause it. Hence\nbenefit\u2014as when men benefit from sexism and whites from\nracism\u2014does not appear to be an appropriate source of collective\nresponsibility for the past actions of others. But it might be an\nappropriate source of collective responsibility for the\nprolongation of the harm and/or its consequences into the\nfuture. In other words, it might be an appropriate source of\ncollective responsibility for present and future, if not for past,\ninjustices\u2014including injustices that began with earlier\nwrongs.\n\nMoreover, while groups of persons might not be good candidates for\nmoral responsibility for past injustices, particular kinds of\ncollective entities\u2014e.g., states, corporations, and organized\nreligions\u2014might be. For, the latter have decision-making bodies,\nexecutive processes, and belief systems that extend over time. Surely,\npositing such a collective entity would be very helpful in the case of\nreparations for slavery in the U.S. and elsewhere. As Maeve McKeown\n(2021) argues in her study of collective responsibility and\nreparations, backward looking reparations for racial abuses\ncan\u2014and should\u2014be justified on the basis of state\nliability over time. Janna Thompson (2006) argues therefore that they\ncan be understood as legitimate sites of moral\nresponsibility\u2014although it is not clear that they have the kinds\nof agency that we normally associate with moral responsibility.\n\nHow, if they are not moral agents, can Thompson or anyone else speak\nof groups such as states, corporations and organized religions, as\nmorally responsible? Thompson feels comfortable speaking of these\ngroups as morally responsible for harm on the grounds that they are\nlike moral agents. According to Thompson, \u201cwhether they\ncount as real moral persons or only act as if they were, it seems that\nwe are, at least sometimes, justified in judging these collectives\naccording to the standards that we apply to moral persons\u201d\n(Thompson, 2006, p. 158).\n\nBut it is not clear that likeness is strong enough to sustain\nthe nature of these groups as moral agents of the kind that we\nnormally associate with moral responsibility. For \u201cacting like a\nmoral agent\u201d is not the same thing as being a moral agent. (And\nif one really is a moral agent then there is no need to go to the\nlengths of specifying likeness.)\n\nWe suggest below that the unlikelihood that groups are really moral\nagents does not mean that the latter cannot be held morally\nresponsible for harm. But it does mean that we have to re-think the\nkinds of moral responsibility that we associate with groups in such a\nway that moral agents of the Kantian kind are not necessary.\n",
