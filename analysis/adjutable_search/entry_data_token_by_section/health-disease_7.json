    "main_text": "Health || Health and Biology\n5.1 Health and Biology\n\nAs noted above, conceptions of health, like conceptions of disease,\ntend to go beyond the simple condition that one is biologically in\nsome state. In the case of health, one view is that a healthy\nindividual is just someone whose biology works as our theories say it\nshould. This is the counterpart, in theories of health, to simple\nobjectivism about disease. It is defended at length by Hausman (2015)\nwho calls it \u201cfunctional efficiency\u201d. As with disease,\nhowever, most scholars who write about health add further conditions\nhaving to do with quality of life. For instance, Hausman argues that\nwhat we are concerned to measure is the contribution that functional\nefficiency makes to overall well-being. We track not health but the\nthings that make health important. Hausman thus distinguishes disease,\nhealth and the value of health. Other scholars draw a similar\nthreefold distinction in different ways. One might have a partly\nevaluative view of health, like a hybrid view of disease, while also\nthinking that health should be distinguished from a broader concept\nlike well-being or flourishing. Such views dispute the line we find in\nBoorse and Hausman that a non-evaluative conception of health is\nviable. Alexandrova (2018), for instance, argues that health is one of\nmany partly normative concepts that give rise to what she calls\n\u201cmixed claims\u201c in the social sciences, that relate,\nempirical variables to normatively derived variables. The definition\nand measurement of health, she insists, must depend on normative\njudgments about what it takes to be healthy.\n\nWhat kinds of normative claims are relevant? Carel (2007, 2008) thinks\nthat the important thing about health is one\u2019s lived experience of\none\u2019s own body, and in particular, that one should not feel estranged\nor alienated from one\u2019s body. Carel argues that health should be\nunderstood phenomenologically as the experience of being at home in\none\u2019s lived body, rather than merely the normal functioning of the\nbody seen as a biological unit.\n\nFrom the naturalist perspective, one problem with this proposal is\nthat it ignores the fact that one can feel perfectly at ease with\none\u2019s lived body even if one harbors, unaware, a diseased system.\nIndeed, Carel argues that someone who is ill can be, in her sense,\nhealthy, if they are adapted to their bodily predicament; from her\nperspective, objections like the one just mentioned miss the point,\nsince they privilege a biological perspective rather than a\nphenomenological one. Her project is avowedly revisionist: she wishes\nto replace existing concepts of health with views that aim to capture\nthe experience of being healthy (or unwell).\n\nCarel\u2019s stress on experience is directly challenged by views like\nGadamer\u2019s. He insists (1996, 113) that it is absurd to ask someone if\nthey feel healthy, since health is \u201cnot a condition that one\nintrospectively feels in oneself. Rather, it is a condition of being\ninvolved, of being in the world, of being together with one\u2019s fellow\nhuman beings, of active and rewarding engagement in one\u2019s everyday\ntasks\u201d. Gadamer\u2019s healthy person is someone who is in harmony\nwith their social and natural environment, and disease is a\ndisturbance of this harmony. Canguilhem (1991, 2012) thinks of health\nas flexibility, in the sense that a healthy organism can tolerate\nenvironmental impacts, adapts to new situations and possesses a store\nof energy and audacity. This is not something that can be measured by\nphysiology (2012, p.49). Canguilhem\u2019s approach suggests what is wrong\nwith Gadamer\u2019s objection to phenomenological accounts of health. A\nphenomenological account does not have to hold, as Gadamer seems to have\nsupposed, that there is a special feeling that is the feeling of being\nhealthy. Rather, for a view like Canguilhem or Carel\u2019s, healthy people\nexperience the world as an arena to express themselves in rather than\na bunch of threats. Antonovsky (1987) puts this in terms of a sense of\ncoherence which enables one to understand the environment and mobilize\ninternal resources against external stressors. It may well be that\nperspectives like Carel\u2019s are neglected in contemporary medicine, and\nthat they are especially important in disability studies. However, it\ndoes not follow that the concepts of health and disease, rather than\naspects of our practices that employ those concepts, should be\nreformed along the lines she suggests. In general, though, accounts of\nhealth, compared to those of disease, are less concerned with trying\nto capture a scientific or clinical concept.\n",
