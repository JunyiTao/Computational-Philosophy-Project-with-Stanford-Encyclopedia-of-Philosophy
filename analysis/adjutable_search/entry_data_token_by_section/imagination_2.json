    "main_text": "The Nature of Imagination || Taxonomies of Imagination\n1.2 Taxonomies of Imagination\n\nTo describe the varieties of imaginings, philosophers have given\npartial and overlapping taxonomies.\n\nSome taxonomies are merely descriptive, and they tend to be less\ncontroversial. For example, Kendall Walton (1990) distinguishes\nbetween spontaneous and deliberate imagining (acts\nof imagination that occur with or without the one\u2019s conscious\ndirection); between occurrent and nonoccurrent\nimaginings (acts of imagination that do or do not occupy the\none\u2019s explicit attention); and between social and\nsolitary imaginings (episodes of imagining that occur with or\nwithout the joint participation of several persons).\n\nOne notable descriptive taxonomy concerns imagining from the\ninside versus from the outside (Williams 1973; Wollheim\n1973; see Ninan 2016 for an overview). To imagine from the outside\nthat one is Napoleon involves imagining a scenario in which one is\nNapoleon. To imagine from the inside that one is Napoleon involves\nthat plus something else: namely, that one is occupying the\nperspective of Napoleon. Imagining from the inside is\nessentially first-personal, imagining from the outside is not. This\ndistinction between two modes of imagining is especially notable for\nits implications for thought experiments about the metaphysics of\npersonal identity (Nichols 2008; Ninan 2009; Williams 1973).\n\nSome taxonomies aim to be more systematic\u2014to carve imaginings at\ntheir joints, so to speak\u2014and they, as one might expect, tend to\nbe more controversial.\n\nGregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) distinguishes creative\nimagination (combining ideas in unexpected and unconventional\nways); sensory imagination (perception-like experiences in\nthe absence of appropriate stimuli); and what they call recreative\nimagination (an ability to experience or think about the world\nfrom a perspective different from the one that experience presents).\nNeil Van Leeuwen (2013, 2014) takes a similar approach to delineate\nthree common uses of \u201cimagination\u201d and cognate terms.\nFirst, these terms can be used to refer to constructive\nimagining, which concerns the process of generating mental\nrepresentations. Second, these terms can be used to refer to\nattitude imagining, which concerns the propositional attitude\none takes toward mental representations. Third, these terms can be\nused to refer to imagistic imagining, which concerns the\nperception-like format of mental representations.\n\nAmy Kind and Peter Kung (2016b) pose the puzzle of imaginative\nuse\u2014on the seeming irreconcilability between the\ntranscendent uses of imagination, which enables one to escape\nfrom or look beyond the world as it is, and the instructive\nuses of imagination, which enables one to learn about the world as it\nis. Kind and Kung ultimately resolve the puzzle by arguing that the\nsame attitude can be put to these seemingly disparate uses because the\ntwo uses differ not in kind, but in degree\u2014specifically, the\ndegree of constraint on imaginings.\n\nFinally, varieties of imagination might be classified in terms of\ntheir structure and content. Consider the following three types of\nimaginings, each illustrated with an example. When one imagines\npropositionally, one represents to oneself that something is the\ncase. So, for example, Juliet might imagine that Romeo is by her\nside. To imagine in this sense is to stand in some mental\nrelation to a particular proposition (see the entry on\n propositional attitude reports).\n When one imagines objectually, one represents to oneself a\nreal or make-believe entity or situation (Yablo 1993; see also Martin\n2002; Noordhof 2002; O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000). So, for example,\nProspero might imagine an acorn or a nymph or\nthe city of Naples or a wedding feast. To imagine in\nthis sense is to stand in some mental relation to a representation of\nan (imaginary or real) entity or state of affairs. When one\nimagines X-ing, one simulatively represents to oneself some\nsort of activity or experience (Walton 1990). So, for example, Ophelia\nmight imagine seeing Hamlet or getting herself to a\nnunnery. To imagine in this sense is to stand in a first-personal\nmental relation to some (imaginary or real) behavior or\nperception.\n",
