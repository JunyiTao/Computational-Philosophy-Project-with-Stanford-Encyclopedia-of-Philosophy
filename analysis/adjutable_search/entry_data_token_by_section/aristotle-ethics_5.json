    "main_text": "The Doctrine of the Mean || Ethical Virtue as Disposition\n5.1 Ethical Virtue as Disposition\n\nAristotle describes ethical virtue as a \u201chexis\u201d\n(\u201cstate\u201d \u201ccondition\u201d\n\u201cdisposition\u201d)\u2014a tendency or disposition, induced by\nour habits, to have appropriate feelings (1105b25\u20136). Defective\nstates of character are hexeis (plural of hexis) as\nwell, but they are tendencies to have inappropriate feelings. The\nsignificance of Aristotle\u2019s characterization of these states as\nhexeis is his decisive rejection of the thesis, found\nthroughout Plato\u2019s early dialogues, that virtue is nothing but a\nkind of knowledge and vice nothing but a lack of knowledge. Although\nAristotle frequently draws analogies between the crafts and the\nvirtues (and similarly between physical health and\neudaimonia), he insists that the virtues differ from the\ncrafts and all branches of knowledge in that the former involve\nappropriate emotional responses and are not purely intellectual\nconditions.\n\nFurthermore, every ethical virtue is a condition intermediate (a\n\u201cgolden mean\u201d as it is popularly known) between two other\nstates, one involving excess, and the other deficiency\n(1106a26\u2013b28). In this respect, Aristotle says, the virtues are\nno different from technical skills: every skilled worker knows how to\navoid excess and deficiency, and is in a condition intermediate\nbetween two extremes. The courageous person, for example, judges that\nsome dangers are worth facing and others not, and experiences fear to\na degree that is appropriate to his circumstances. He lies between the\ncoward, who flees every danger and experiences excessive fear, and the\nrash person, who judges every danger worth facing and experiences\nlittle or no fear. Aristotle holds that this same topography applies\nto every ethical virtue: all are located on a map that places the\nvirtues between states of excess and deficiency. He is careful to add,\nhowever, that the mean is to be determined in a way that takes into\naccount the particular circumstances of the individual\n(1106a36\u2013b7). The arithmetic mean between 10 and 2 is 6, and\nthis is so invariably, whatever is being counted. But the intermediate\npoint that is chosen by an expert in any of the crafts will vary from\none situation to another. There is no universal rule, for example,\nabout how much food an athlete should eat, and it would be absurd to\ninfer from the fact that 10 lbs. is too much and 2 lbs. too little for\nme that I should eat 6 lbs. Finding the mean in any given situation is\nnot a mechanical or thoughtless procedure, but requires a full and\ndetailed acquaintance with the circumstances.\n\nIt should be evident that Aristotle\u2019s treatment of virtues as\nmean states endorses the idea that we should sometimes have strong\nfeelings\u2014when such feelings are called for by our situation.\nSometimes only a small degree of anger is appropriate; but at other\ntimes, circumstances call for great anger. The right amount is not\nsome quantity between zero and the highest possible level, but rather\nthe amount, whatever it happens to be, that is proportionate to the\nseriousness of the situation. Of course, Aristotle is committed to\nsaying that anger should never reach the point at which it undermines\nreason; and this means that our passion should always fall short of\nthe extreme point at which we would lose control. But it is possible\nto be very angry without going to this extreme, and Aristotle does not\nintend to deny this.\n\nThe theory of the mean is open to several objections, but before\nconsidering them, we should recognize that in fact there are two\ndistinct theses each of which might be called a doctrine of the mean.\nFirst, there is the thesis that every virtue is a state that lies\nbetween two vices, one of excess and the other of deficiency. Second,\nthere is the idea that whenever a virtuous person chooses to perform a\nvirtuous act, he can be described as aiming at an act that is in some\nway or other intermediate between alternatives that he rejects. It is\nthis second thesis that is most likely to be found objectionable. A\ncritic might concede that in some cases virtuous acts can be described\nin Aristotle\u2019s terms. If, for example, one is trying to decide\nhow much to spend on a wedding present, one is looking for an amount\nthat is neither excessive nor deficient. But surely many other\nproblems that confront a virtuous agent are not susceptible to this\nquantitative analysis. If one must decide whether to attend a wedding\nor respect a competing obligation instead, it would not be\nilluminating to describe this as a search for a mean between\nextremes\u2014unless \u201caiming at the mean\u201d simply becomes\nanother phrase for trying to make the right decision. The objection,\nthen, is that Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the mean, taken as a\ndoctrine about what the ethical agent does when he deliberates, is in\nmany cases inapplicable or unilluminating.\n\nA defense of Aristotle would have to say that the virtuous person does\nafter all aim at a mean, if we allow for a broad enough notion of what\nsort of aiming is involved. For example, consider a juror who must\ndetermine whether a defendant is guilty as charged. He does not have\nbefore his mind a quantitative question; he is trying to decide\nwhether the accused committed the crime, and is not looking for some\nquantity of action intermediate between extremes. Nonetheless, an\nexcellent juror can be described as someone who, in trying to arrive\nat the correct decision, seeks to express the right degree of concern\nfor all relevant considerations. He searches for the verdict that\nresults from a deliberative process that is neither overly credulous\nnor unduly skeptical. Similarly, in facing situations that arouse\nanger, a virtuous agent must determine what action (if any) to take in\nresponse to an insult, and although this is not itself a quantitative\nquestion, his attempt to answer it properly requires him to have the\nright degree of concern for his standing as a member of the community.\nHe aims at a mean in the sense that he looks for a response that\navoids too much or too little attention to factors that must be taken\ninto account in making a wise decision.\n\nPerhaps a greater difficulty can be raised if we ask how Aristotle\ndetermines which emotions are governed by the doctrine of the mean.\nConsider someone who loves to wrestle, for example. Is this passion\nsomething that must be felt by every human being at appropriate times\nand to the right degree? Surely someone who never felt this emotion to\nany degree could still live a perfectly happy life. Why then should we\nnot say the same about at least some of the emotions that Aristotle\nbuilds into his analysis of the ethically virtuous agent? Why should\nwe experience anger at all, or fear, or the degree of concern for\nwealth and honor that Aristotle commends? These are precisely the\nquestions that were asked in antiquity by the Stoics, and they came to\nthe conclusion that such common emotions as anger and fear are always\ninappropriate. Aristotle assumes, on the contrary, not simply that\nthese common passions are sometimes appropriate, but that it is\nessential that every human being learn how to master them and\nexperience them in the right way at the right times. A defense of his\nposition would have to show that the emotions that figure in his\naccount of the virtues are valuable components of any well-lived human\nlife, when they are experienced properly. Perhaps such a project could\nbe carried out, but Aristotle himself does not attempt to do so.\n\nHe often says, in the course of his discussion, that when the good\nperson chooses to act virtuously, he does so for the sake of the\n\u201ckalon\u201d\u2014a word that can mean\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d, \u201cnoble\u201d, or \u201cfine\u201d\n(see for example 1120a23\u20134). This term indicates that Aristotle\nsees in ethical activity an attraction that is comparable to the\nbeauty of well-crafted artifacts, including such artifacts as poetry,\nmusic, and drama. He draws this analogy in his discussion of the mean,\nwhen he says that every craft tries to produce a work from which\nnothing should be taken away and to which nothing further should be\nadded (1106b5\u201314). A craft product, when well designed and\nproduced by a good craftsman, is not merely useful, but also has such\nelements as balance, proportion and harmony\u2014for these are\nproperties that help make it useful. Similarly, Aristotle holds that a\nwell-executed project that expresses the ethical virtues will not\nmerely be advantageous but kalon as well\u2014for the\nbalance it strikes is part of what makes it advantageous. The young\nperson learning to acquire the virtues must develop a love of doing\nwhat is kalon and a strong aversion to its opposite\u2014the\naischron, the shameful and ugly. Determining what is\nkalon is difficult (1106b28\u201333, 1109a24\u201330), and\nthe normal human aversion to embracing difficulties helps account for\nthe scarcity of virtue (1104b10\u201311).\n",
