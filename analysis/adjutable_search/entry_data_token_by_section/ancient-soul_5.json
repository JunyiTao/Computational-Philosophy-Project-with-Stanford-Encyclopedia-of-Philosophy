    "main_text": "Aristotle's Theory of Soul\n4. Aristotle's Theory of Soul\n\n Aristotle's theory, as it is presented primarily in the De\nAnima (for a complete account,\n see Aristotle's Psychology),\n comes very close to providing a comprehensive, fully developed\naccount of the soul in all its aspects and functions, an account that\narticulates the ways in which all of the vital functions of all\nanimate organisms are related to the soul. In doing so, the theory\ncomes very close to offering a comprehensive answer to a question that\narises from the ordinary Greek notion of soul, namely how precisely it\nis that the soul, which is agreed to be in some way or other\nresponsible for a variety of things living creatures (especially\nhumans) do and experience, also is the distinguishing mark of the\nanimate. According to Aristotle's theory, a soul is a particular kind\nof nature, a principle that accounts for change and rest in the\nparticular case of living bodies, i.e. plants, nonhuman animals and\nhuman beings. The relation between soul and body, on Aristotle's view,\nis also an instance of the more general relation between form and\nmatter: thus an ensouled, living body is a particular kind of\nin-formed matter. Slightly simplifying things by limiting ourselves to\nthe sublunary world (cf. De Anima 2.2, 413a32; 2.3, 415a9), we\ncan describe the theory as furnishing a unified explanatory framework\nwithin which all vital functions alike, from metabolism to reasoning,\nare treated as functions performed by natural organisms of suitable\nstructure and complexity. The soul of an animate organism, in this\nframework, is nothing other than its system of active abilities to\nperform the vital functions that organisms of its kind naturally\nperform, so that when an organism engages in the relevant activities\n(e.g., nutrition, movement or thought) it does so in virtue of the\nsystem of abilities that is its soul. \n\n Given that the soul is, according to Aristotle's theory, a system of\nabilities possessed and manifested by animate bodies of suitable\nstructure, it is clear that the soul is, according to Aristotle, not\nitself a body or a corporeal thing. Thus Aristotle agrees with the\nPhaedo's claim that souls are very different from bodies.\nMoreover, Aristotle seems to think that all the abilities that are\nconstitutive of the souls of plants, beasts and humans are such that\ntheir exercise involves and requires bodily parts and organs. This is\nobviously so with, for instance, the abilities for movement in respect\nof place (e.g., by walking or flying), and for sense-perception, which\nrequires sense-organs. Aristotle does not, however, think that there\nis an organ of thought, and so he also does not think that the\nexercise of the ability to think involves the use of a bodily part or\norgan that exists specifically for this use. Nevertheless, he does\nseem to take the view that the activity of the human intellect always\ninvolves some activity of the perceptual apparatus, and hence requires\nthe presence, and proper arrangement, of suitable bodily parts and\norgans; for he seems to think that sensory impressions\n[phantasmata] are somehow involved in every occurrent act of\nthought, at least as far as human beings are concerned (De\nAnima 3.7, 431a14-7; 3.8, 432a7-10; cf. De Memoria 1,\n449b31ff.). If so, Aristotle in fact seems to be committed to the view\nthat, contrary to the Platonic position, even human souls are not\ncapable of existence and (perhaps as importantly) activity\napart from the body (cf. De Anima 1.1, 403a3-25,\nesp. 5-16).\n\n It is noteworthy that Aristotle's theory does not mark off those\nvital functions that are mental by relating them to the soul in some\nspecial way that differs from and goes beyond the way in which vital\nfunctions in general are so related. It is certainly not part of\nAristotle's theory that the soul is specially and directly responsible\nfor mental functions by performing them on its own, whereas it is less\ndirectly responsible for the performance by the living organism of\nother vital functions such as growth. As this aspect of his theory\nsuggests, Aristotle is confident that once one has a proper\nunderstanding of how to explain natural phenomena in general, there is\nno reason to suppose that mental functions like perception, desire and\nat least some forms of thinking cannot be explained simply by\nappealing to the principles in terms of which natural phenomena in\ngeneral are properly understood and explained (cf. Frede 1992,\n97).\n\n It might be thought that since Aristotle's theory treats mental\nfunctions and other vital functions exactly alike, it obscures a\ncrucial distinction. This worry, however, turns out to be unjustified.\nThe theory treats mental and other vital functions alike only in that\nit views both kinds of functions as performed by natural organisms of\nthe right kind of structure and complexity. Viewing mental and other\nvital functions in this way is perfectly compatible with introducing a\ndistinction between mental and other functions if concerns of some\nkind or other call for such a distinction.  Aristotle is perfectly\ncapable, for instance, of setting aside non-mental vital functions as\nirrelevant for the purposes of practical philosophy\n (NE 1.13, 1102b11-12).\n",
