    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion || God\u2019s Moral Attributes\n8.3 God\u2019s Moral Attributes\n\nDemea begins the discussion in Part 10. Attempting to save face from\nhis recent drubbing, he suggests that we don\u2019t accept the truths\nof religion as a result of reasoning, but from what we feel\nwhen confronted with how helpless and miserable we are. Religion is\nbased on feelings of fear and anxiety that arise from awareness of our\n\u201cimbecility and misery\u201d (DCNR 10.1/68). Our forms of\nworship are attempts to appease unknown powers that oppress and\ntorment us.\n\nPhilo joins in, claiming he is convinced that\n\n\nthe best and indeed the only method of bringing everyone to a due\nsense of religion is by just representations of the misery and\nwickedness of men. (DCNR 10.2/68)\n\n\nThey proceed with a joint litany of the misery and melancholy of the\nhuman condition, topping each other with catalogues of woes. Demea\ndoes not realize that Philo may mean very different things by\n\u201cjust representation\u201d and \u201cdue sense of\nreligion\u201d than he does, so he fails to realize that Philo is\njust egging him on.\n\nPhilo maintains that we can\u2019t evade the facts of disease,\nfamine, and pestilence, except by \u201capologies, which still\nfarther aggravate the charge\u201d (DCNR 10.16/72). These apologies\nare theodicies\u2014systematic attempts to reconcile\nGod\u2019s goodness with the existence of evil. Demea is also\nscornful of theodicies, blissfully unaware that all too soon he will\nbe offering his own.\n\nCleanthes finally breaks in to say that he doesn\u2019t feel\noppressively anxious or miserable, and hopes that anguish isn\u2019t\nas common as they claim. But hoping that the extent of human\nmisery is not so widespread is not the same as proving that\nit is. Cleanthes is on weak ground. Philo capitalizes on it,\nchallenging Cleanthes to explain how God\u2019s mercy and benevolence\ncan possibly resemble human mercy and benevolence. Given God\u2019s\nomnipotence, whatever he wills happens, but neither humans nor animals\nare happy, so God presumably does not will their happiness.\n\nCleanthes\u2014\u201csmiling\u201d\u2014grants that if Philo can\nprove that mankind is \u201cunhappy or corrupted\u201d, he\nwill have succeeded in doing in religion (DCNR 10.28/74). He thinks he\nfinally has Philo on the ropes. In forcing a sceptic to prove a\npositive thesis, he must not only succeed at a difficult task, but\nviolates his scepticism in the process. Cleanthes fails to realize\nthat Philo will make his case without needing to prove anything, nor\ndoes he realize that he will soon be the one who needs a\nproof.\n\nDemea objects that Cleanthes exaggerates the dire consequences of\nacknowledging the human condition, and, despite his earlier vehement\nrejection of theodicies, offers his own. Sometimes called \u201cthe\nporch view\u201d, Demea\u2019s theodicy compares our experience of\nthe world to the world as a whole, including the afterlife, to trying\nto determine the structure of a large building from what little we can\nsee from its porch. From our perspective, we suffer, but from a longer\nview, either we don\u2019t suffer at all, or else our suffering is\nfor our greater good or for the greater good of the world.\n\nCleanthes retorts that Demea denies the facts, and offers only empty\nhypotheses, which, if intelligible at all, could only establish their\nbare possibility, but never their reality. The only way to respond to\nchallenges to God\u2019s benevolence is to deny that the human\ncondition is really so miserable.\n\nCleanthes has now put himself in the position in which he thought he\nhad put Philo. He must establish that the facts are as he claims, and\nPhilo is quick to stress how difficult this will be. By resting his\ncase on such an uncertain point, any conclusion he draws will be\nequally uncertain.\n\nPhilo then ups the ante by granting for the sake of argument that\nhuman happiness exceeds human misery. But if God is infinitely\npowerful, wise, and good, why is there any misery at all? There is no\nanswer that preserves all God\u2019s attributes, except to grant that\nthe subject exceeds the limits of our understanding.\n\nPhilo, however, refrains from pressing the question of\nintelligibility; he is more interested in building an even\nstronger case against Cleanthes\u2019 inference to God\u2019s\nbenevolence. Raising the ante higher still, he grants that\npain and suffering are compatible with God\u2019s infinite\npower and goodness. Cleanthes, however, must prove from the\n\u201cmixed and confused phenomena\u201d that God\u2019s\nbenevolence is actual, not merely possible. Doing so\nis doubly difficult, since any inference from finite to infinite is\nshaky at best, even when the data are \u201cpure and unmixed\u201d\n(DCNR 10.35/77).\n\nPhilo concludes by admitting, with less than complete sincerity, that\nwhile he was hard pressed to make his case against Cleanthes when the\ndiscussion concerned God\u2019s natural attributes, where his moral\nattributes are concerned, he is at ease. He challenges Cleanthes\n\u201cto tug the laboring oar\u201d and explain how he can infer\nGod\u2019s moral attributes from the facts about the human condition\n(DCNR 10.36/77).\n\nCleanthes \u201ctugs\u201d, but only for one short paragraph. He\nadmits that if we go beyond their usual meanings when we apply human\nterms to God, what we say is indeed unintelligible. Abandoning all\nhuman analogy is thus to abandon natural religion, but preserving it\nmakes it impossible to reconcile evil with an infinite God.\n\nCleanthes realizes he has painted himself into a corner, but once\nagain he thinks there is a way out. Abandon God\u2019s infinity;\nthink of him as \u201cfinitely perfect\u201d. Then\n\u201cbenevolence, regulated by wisdom, and limited by necessity, may\nproduce just such a world as the present\u201d (DCNR 11.1/78).\n\nCleanthes doesn\u2019t realize that his new theory is worse than his\nold one. He also doesn\u2019t seem to remember Philo\u2019s earlier\nquestion about what \u201cfinitely perfect\u201d might possibly\nmean. Instead of God, he is now committed to some kind of superhero.\nBesides, the story he is telling is itself a theodicy. His\nsuperhero\u2019s limitations explain why he cannot eliminate evil, or\ncreate an evil\u2013free world.\n\nIn any case, Cleanthes is no better off than he was before.\nConjectures may show that the data are consistent with the\nidea of God, but are never sufficient to prove that he actually\nexists.\n\nPhilo then proceeds to outline four possible hypotheses about the\ncause of the universe: it is perfectly good; it is perfectly evil; it\nis both good and evil; it is neither good nor evil. Given the evil we\nknow exists, the data is at best mixed, so we can\u2019t\nestablish either of the first two hypotheses. The regularity and\nuniformity of the general laws we find in experience is sufficient to\ndiscount the third, so the fourth seems the most probable. On that\nhypothesis, the cause of the universe is entirely indifferent to the\namount of good and evil in the world.\n\nThese points about natural evil also apply to moral\nevil. We have no more reason to think that God\u2019s righteousness\nresembles human righteousness than we have to think that his\nbenevolence resembles human benevolence. We have even less reason, in\nfact, since moral evil outweighs moral goodness more than natural evil\noutweighs natural goodness.\n\nIn addition, Cleanthes\u2019 new form of anthropomorphism is saddled\nwith tracing moral evil back to God. Since every effect must have a\ncause, either the chain of causes goes back infinitely, or it stops\nwith the original principle that is the ultimate cause of all\nthings\u2014God.\n\nAt this point, Demea, who has become increasingly agitated during\nPhilo\u2019s speech, interrupts. He finally realizes that the case\nPhilo is making cuts against his own view as much as it cuts against\nCleanthes\u2019. Although it might appear that Demea can retreat to\nsome form of the theodicy he sketched earlier, the extent to which\nPhilo\u2019s argument upsets him suggests that he now realizes it is\ninadequate. If he leans on the mystery\u2013mongering he has\nprofessed until now, Philo has shown that, because of its lack of\nspecific content, it does not point exclusively to a good God. It may\njust as well commit him to a supreme being who is \u201cbeyond good\nand evil\u201d and is totally indifferent to morality. Commitment\nwithout content turns out to be no commitment at all. Demea realizes\nthis, dimly at least, as he leaves the conversation.\n",
