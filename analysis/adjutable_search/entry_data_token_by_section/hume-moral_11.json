    "main_text": "Fidelity to Promises\n11. Fidelity to Promises\n\n\nFidelity is the virtue of being disposed to fulfill promises and\ncontracts. Hume has in mind promises made \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d\nthat parties undertake to promote their own interest, not affectionate\nexchanges of favors between friends. While he identifies the same circularity\npuzzle about the approved motive of fidelity that he tackles at length\nin connection with honesty, in the case of fidelity he concentrates on a\ndifferent conundrum that arises with the misguided attempt to analyze\nfidelity as a non-conventional (natural) virtue. Unlike Hobbes and\nLocke, who help themselves to the concept of a promise or contract in\ntheir imagined state of nature, Hume argues that the performative\nutterance \u201cI promise\u201d would be unintelligible in the\nabsence of background social conventions, and that the moral obligation\nof a promise is dependent upon such conventions as well.\n\n\nSuppose the practice of giving and receiving promises did not depend\non a socially-defined convention. In that case, what could we mean by\nthe utterances we use to make them, and what would be the origin of our\nobligation to fulfill them? Where the words are used\n(uncharacteristically) in a way that does not purport to\nreveal the agent\u2019s will (as when the person is joking or play-acting), we do not think a promise is really being\nmade; we only take a speaker to have promised, and so to be bound to\nperform, if he understands the words he uses, in particular as\npurporting to obligate him. Thus for effective use there must be some\nact of the speaker\u2019s mind expressed by the special phrase \u201cI\npromise\u201d and its synonyms, and our moral obligation results from\nthis act of the mind. (This seems to be Hobbes\u2019s assumption in\nLeviathan, where the implicit signs of covenant \u2014 as\ndistinct from the explicit ones \u2014 are clear signs of the person\u2019s\nwill.) The requisite mental act or mental state, though, could not be\none of mere desire or resolution to act, since it does not follow from\nour desiring or resolving to act that we are morally obligated to do\nso; nor could it be the volition to act, since that does not come into\nbeing ahead of time when we promise, but only when the time comes to\nact. And of course, one can promise successfully (incur obligation by\npromising) even though one has no intention to perform; so the mental\nact requisite to obligation is not the intention to perform. The only likely act of\nmind that might be expressed in a promise is a mental act of\nwilling to be obligated to perform the promised action, as\nthis conforms to our common view that we bind ourselves by choosing to\nbe bound.\n\n\nBut, Hume argues, it is absurd to think that one can actually bring\nan obligation into existence by willing to be obligated. What makes an\naction obligatory is that its omission is disapproved by unbiased\nobservers. But no act of will within an agent can directly change a previously\nneutral act into one that provokes moral disapproval in observers\n(even in the agent herself). Sentiments are not subject to such\nvoluntary control. Even on a moral rationalist view the thesis would be \nabsurd: to create a new obligation would be to change the abstract\nrelations in which actions and persons stand to one\nanother, and one cannot do this \nby performing in one\u2019s own mind an act of willing such a relation to\nexist. Thus, there is no such act of the mind. Even if people in their\nnatural (pre-conventional) condition \u201ccou\u2019d perceive each other\u2019s\nthoughts by intuition,\u201d they could not understand one another to\nbind themselves by any act of promising, and could not be obligated\nthereby. Since the necessary condition for a natural obligation of\npromises cannot be fulfilled, we may conclude that this obligation is\ninstead the product of group invention to serve the interests of\nsociety.\n\n\nPromises are invented in order to build upon the advantages afforded\nby property.  The invention of mere ownership suffices to\nmake possession stable. The introduction of transfer by consent permits some trade, but so far only simultaneous swapping of visible\ncommodities. Great advantages could be gained by all if people could\nbe counted on to provide goods or services later for benefits given\nnow, or exchange goods that are distant or described generically. But\nfor people without the capacity to obligate themselves to future\naction, such exchanges would depend upon the party who performs second doing so\nout of gratitude alone; and that motive cannot generally be\nrelied on in self-interested transactions. However, we can devise better\nways to satisfy our appetites \u201cin an oblique and artificial manner...\u201d\n(T 3.2.5.9). First, people can easily recognize that additional kinds\nof mutual exchanges would serve their interests. They need only\nexpress this interest to one another in order to encourage everyone to\ninvent and to keep such agreements. They devise a form of words to\nmark these new sorts of exchanges (and distinguish them from the\ngenerous reciprocal acts of friendship and gratitude). When someone\nutters this form of words, he is understood to express a resolution to\ndo the action in question, and he \u201csubjects himself to the penalty of\nnever being trusted again in case of failure\u201d (T 3.2.5.10), a penalty\nmade possible by the practice of the group, who enforce the\nrequirement to keep promises by the simple expedient of refusing to\ncontract with those whose word cannot be trusted . This \u201cconcert or\nconvention\u201d (ibid.) alters human motives to act. One is moved by\nself-interest to give the promising sign (in order to obtain the other\nparty\u2019s cooperation), and once one has given it, self-interest demands\nthat one do what one promised to do so as to insure that people will\nexchange promises with one in the future. Some interpreters say that\nthis enlightened self-interest remains the only motive for keeping\none\u2019s promise, once the practice of promising has been created. But\nHume says the sentiment of morals comes to play the same role in\npromise-keeping that it does in the development of honesty with\nrespect to property (T 3.2.5.12); so there is evidence he thinks the\nmoral sentiment not only becomes \u201cannex\u2019d\u201d to\npromise-keeping but further motivates it. In larger, more anonymous\ncommunities, a further incentive is needed besides the fear of\nexclusion; and a sentiment of moral approval of promise-keeping arises\nas the result of sympathy with all who benefit from the practice,\naided by a \u201csecond artifice,\u201d the well-meaning\npsychological manipulation of the people by parents and politicians,\nwhich yields a near-universal admiration of fidelity and shame at\nbreaking one\u2019s word (T 3.2.5.12). This may provide a moral motive for\npromise-keeping even in anonymous transactions.\n",
