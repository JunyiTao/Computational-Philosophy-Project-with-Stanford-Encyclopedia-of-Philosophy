    "main_text": "The \u201cSpheres of Existence\u201d or \u201cStages on Life\u2019s Way\u201d || The Religious and the Life of Faith\n3.3 The Religious and the Life of Faith\n\nWhile Kierkegaard does not explicitly explore faith, hope and love as\nthe three theological virtues, all three notions play important roles\nin his thought, and can be used to amplify his view of the religious\nlife.\n3.3.1 Faith\n\nFaith is a major theme across Kierkegaard\u2019s authorship. It is\nthe central issue of Fear and Trembling (which as noted\nexplores the nature of faith through an investigation of one of its\nkey biblical exemplars, Abraham), while in later writings Kierkegaard\nexplores in various ways the nature of specifically Christian\nfaith.\n\nSince Fear and Trembling is probably the best-known and most\nread of Kierkegaard\u2019s works, the views of its pseudonymous\nauthor are often taken to be Kierkegaard\u2019s own. But since\nJohannes de silentio claims to be an outsider to \u201cfaith\u201d,\nand repeatedly tells us he cannot understand Abraham, this is a\ndangerous move. Johannes\u2019 focus is on the events of Genesis 22,\nwherein Abraham receives the shocking command to sacrifice his\nlong-awaited son Isaac on Mount Moriah. Abraham shows his willingness\nto do so over a three-day journey, right up to the binding and drawing\nof the knife. Yet at the last minute God sends an angel to prevent the\nkilling, Abraham instead sacrificing a ram caught by its horns in a\nthicket.\n\nThis is the exemplar of faith that Johannes struggles to understand.\nHe tells and retells the story of Abraham in multiple versions, aiming\nto get closer to understanding faith by contrasting it with\nsuperficially similar but ultimately different cases of\nwhat-faith-is-not. One development in scholarly interpretation over\nthe decades has been a shift away from a tendency in some earlier\nscholarship to leap instantly to the three Problems in the second part\nof the book (what Johannes calls its \u201cdialectical\u201d\nsections)\u2014especially the first, as to whether the story of\nAbraham contains a \u201cteleological suspension of the\nethical\u201d. The importance of paying attention to the earlier\nsections of the book is now widely recognized. This includes the early\naccount, in the section entitled \u201cAttunement\u201d or\n\u201cTuning Up\u201d (Stemning), of four different\nversions of the Abraham story. We might call them\n\u201csub-Abrahams\u201d (cf. Lippitt 2016). All of them are\nprepared to obey God, but each differs in various ways from the\nAbraham who is the \u201cfather of faith\u201d. This should warn us\noff readings which suggest that the central message of the\ntext\u2014and of faith\u2014is simply the importance of being\nobedient to God. Another key contrast (in the section entitled\n\u201cPreliminary Outpouring from the Heart\u201d) is between faith\nand \u201cinfinite resignation\u201d. The \u201cknight of infinite\nresignation\u201d has an openness and comprehensibility to Johannes\nthat the enigmatic \u201cknight of faith\u201d lacks. In a strategy\nnot uncommon in Kierkegaard\u2019s authorship, faith is illustrated\nby drawing a parallel with love. Specifically, silentio illustrates\nthe distinction between faith and infinite resignation through a story\nof two different versions of a young lad who falls in love with an\nunattainable princess (FT 34ff./SKS 4, 136ff.). Infinite\nresignation\u2014the first move in the \u201cdouble movement\u201d\nof faith\u2014involves the renunciation of important goods or\ncommitments in favor of those considered to be \u201chigher\u201d.\nThis sacrifice, while painful, contains a certain \u201cpeace and\nrest and consolation\u201d (FT 38/SKS 4, 140). Yet the knight of\nfaith manages fully to value finite goods (Isaac or the princess) in a\nway that his infinite resignation counterpart does not. Commentators\nhave disagreed on how to interpret this (see, e.g., Mooney 1991, R.\nHall 2000, and Davenport 2008; for a summary, see Lippitt 2016:\n59\u201373). But a key notion seems to be that whereas infinite\nresignation is something that I can achieve through my own will, the\nknight of faith both recognizes his dependence upon a divine power\nbeyond himself and trusts in God\u2019s promises\u2014even in the\nmost extraordinary \u201ctrial\u201d of the akedah\u2014in\na way that appears to an outsider like Johannes as\n\u201cabsurd\u201d. Remarkably, the knight of faith is able to take\na genuine joy in the finite world, receiving it back (in the form of\nIsaac or the princess) despite having given it up in\n\u201cresignation\u201d. Crucial here is the idea that God\u2019s\npromises are for this life, not just an after-life. The true\nmeasure of Abraham\u2019s faith is less his willingness to sacrifice\nIsaac than his trust and hope that he will \u201creceive him\nback\u201d\u2014in this life, not just in eternity.\n\nEach of the three Problems begins with the idea that \u201cthe\nethical as such is the universal\u201d, a different dimension of\nwhich is brought out in each Problem. Does Abraham\u2019s faith\ncontain a \u201cteleological suspension of the ethical\u201d?\nAbraham seems to offend against \u201cthe universal\u201d in four\nways, all closely related. First, he makes of himself an exception to\nwhat universality demands (one ought not to kill one\u2019s innocent\noffspring). This\u2014secondly\u2014amounts to the\n\u201cparadox\u201d that the \u201csingle individual\u201d stands\nhigher than the universal. Hegelian concerns about the dangers of\nsubjectivity\u2014such that Moralit\u00e4t (concerning an\nindividual\u2019s inner will or intention) needs to be subordinated\nto Sittlichkeit (the customs, norms and institutions of a\nrational society)\u2014are relevant here. The problem with Abraham is\nthat his private relationship to God is given priority over his duties\nas a social creature. Thus\u2014third\u2014Abraham stands in a\ndirect, unmediated relation to God and so\u2014fourth\u2014he cannot\nexplain his actions in publicly available, shareable language. The\nradical privacy of his God-relationship is key to understanding the\ndifference between the knight of faith and the \u201ctragic\nhero\u201d, the next on the list of what-faith-is-not. The stories of\nAgamemnon, Jepthah and Brutus (FT 50\u20132/SKS 4, 151\u20133) each\noffers another case of a father feeling the obligation to sacrifice\nhis own offspring for a cause conceived of as \u201chigher\u201d.\nThe key difference is that each of these can explain himself by giving\na publicly comprehensible account of his actions (such as a military\nleader\u2019s duties to the state overriding those to his own\nfamily). These explanations are within the realm of the ethical\nconceived of as the universal, whereas\u2014according to\nJohannes\u2014Abraham has no such explanation available to him. His\nfaith is a \u201cpurely personal virtue\u201d (FT 52/SKS 4, 153) as\nopposed to the virtue of Sittlichkeit embodied by the tragic\nhero. This relationship between the single individual and the\nuniversal is further explored in Problems II and III. The former\nfocuses on whether our duty to God is absolute; and what that implies\nin the case of the kind of direct God-relationship exemplified by\nAbraham. The lengthy Problem III, which\u2014focusing on\nAbraham\u2019s silence\u2014considers whether concealing his purpose\nfrom others (such as his son, wife and servant) was ethically\ndefensible. Problem III in particular has divided commentators, some\nviewing it as somewhat rambling, others as crucially\nimportant\u2014especially those who attribute significance to the\nbook\u2019s motto, and its apparent suggestion that the book may\ncontain a hidden message not understood by the messenger (Johannes\nhimself?). For these latter, the story of Agnete and the merman (FT\n82ff./SKS 4, 183ff.), with its discussion of sin and\nrepentance\u2014important themes elsewhere in Kierkegaard\u2019s\nauthorship\u2014has seemed particularly important (e.g., Green 1993,\nMulhall 2001, Krishek 2009; for an overview, see Lippitt 2016:\n196\u2013206).\n\nAs noted above, what Climacus in the Postscript labels\nReligiousness A is a religion of immanence that requires no\ntranscendent revelation. Genuine Christianity, on Kierkegaard\u2019s\nview, emphatically does rest on such a revelation. Johannes Climacus,\nin Philosophical Fragments, provides a humorous and ironic\nattempt to \u201cinvent\u201d something that looks suspiciously like\nChristianity. He begins with an account of the Socratic view\n(understood very much in terms of Plato\u2019s Socrates) of\n\u201cthe Truth\u201d and how it is obtained, and then seeks an\nalternative to the Socratic view that the Truth can be found through\n\u201crecollection\u201d. The alternative requires a teacher who is\ndivine, but who out of self-giving love becomes human. (The irony and\nhumor consist in a mock attempt to \u201cinvent\u201d something\nwhose essence is that it cannot be a human invention.)\n\nFragments offers the first delineation in Kierkegaard\u2019s\nauthorship of the idea that Christian faith is centered on the\nincarnation (\u201cthe God-man\u201d). The incarnation is claimed to\nbe the \u201cthe Absolute Paradox\u201d, and it is variously\ndescribed as \u201ca contradiction\u201d, or \u201cthe most\nimprobable\u201d (PF 52/ SKS 4, 256) of all things. Although both\nClimacus and Kierkegaard, in later writings, insist that the\nincarnation must be seen as an historical event, since otherwise we\nare \u201cback to Socrates\u201d, they reject any attempt to base\nfaith in the God-man on historical evidence. Rather, faith in the\nincarnation is seen as something that is given directly to the\ndisciple by the God-man, though the encounter (for later generations)\nis mediated through historical testimony. (Kierkegaard\u2019s\nnon-evidentialist account of faith can be usefully compared to the\nexternalist account of faith found in contemporary \u201cReformed\nepistemology\u201d (Evans 2006: 169\u2013182, 183\u2013205)).\nThough Kierkegaard does not write about epistemology in a systematic\nmanner, he writes about knowledge and belief in many places (see Piety\n2010 for a good overview of his thoughts on such matters). His views\nof moral and religious knowledge can also be compared to the\ncontemporary development of virtue epistemology, which puts more\nemphasis on the character of the knower in the acquisition of\nknowledge, in contrast to most modern epistemologies, which have\nfocused largely on evidence and said little about the traits or\ncharacteristics that might make it possible for a person to grasp the\ntruth.\n\nCalling the incarnation a \u201ccontradiction\u201d has suggested to\nsome that Kierkegaard is a radical fideist who sees Christian faith as\nrequiring a rejection of reason by believing what is logically\ncontradictory, a view applauded by some (e.g., Shestov 1936 [1969]),\nand decried by others (e.g., Pojman 1984). However, it is far from\nobvious that Kierkegaard saw Christian faith this way. To\nKierkegaard\u2019s Danish contemporaries, the term for\n\u201ccontradiction\u201d (Modsigelse) would not have meant\nonly or even mainly a logical contradiction. Rather, Kierkegaard\nfrequently uses the term to describe a tension or incongruity. Human\nexistence itself is described as involving the same\n\u201ccontradiction\u201d as the incarnation, the synthesizing of\ntemporality and eternity, and Kierkegaard also says that all humor\nfocuses on contradictions (by which he clearly means something like\nincongruity (Lippitt 2000: 8\u201311)). Kierkegaard certainly sees\nthe incarnation as something that human reason cannot understand; as\nsuch it poses \u201cthe possibility of offense\u201d for a person\nwho is unwilling to recognize that there could be truth that\ntranscends immanent human capacities. However, Kierkegaard also\ninsists that offense is not more rationally justified than is faith.\nFaith and offense are opposite and rival passions, and neither can be\nfully justified by reason. (For more on these issues, see Evans\n1992.)\n\nIn Kierkegaard\u2019s later writing, both in signed works and in the\nwritings of Anti-Climacus, the offense of faith is often described\nmore in ethical than intellectual terms. In these writings the\nbarriers to faith are seen as pride and selfishness, since faith in\nChrist requires a radical willingness to love the neighbor, a category\nwhich even includes one\u2019s enemies.\n3.3.2 Love\n\nScholarship over the last two decades or so has increasingly\nrecognized the importance and profundity of Kierkegaard\u2019s\nthought on love (see, e.g., R. Hall 2000, Ferreira 2001, A. Hall 2002,\nEvans 2004, Furtak 2005, Krishek 2009, Lippitt 2013a, 2020, Strawser\n2015). The question of what it means to love well is one that runs\nthrough many of his writings, pseudonymous and signed. As alluded to\nabove, Either/Or contrasts the aesthetic picture of erotic\nlove as immediate immersion in the infatuation of \u201cfirst\nlove\u201d or hyper-reflective seduction (\u201clove\u201d as a\nkind of game) with married love as preserving love in time (living\nsimultaneously in \u201chope\u201d and \u201crecollection:\u201d\ndeveloping a shared history, properly related to a shared past and a\nshared future, and thus making love \u201chistorical\u201d.) For the\nJudge, such love may be made \u201ceternal\u201d by being freely\ntaken upon as one\u2019s duty. Related themes are also explored in\nStages on Life\u2019s Way. Fear and Trembling,\noften approached as being about a clash of duties (between\nAbraham\u2019s duty to his God and ethical duties conceived of in\nterms of \u201cthe universal\u201d), may just as well be approached\nas an apparent clash of loves (for God; for Isaac).\n\nHowever, Kierkegaard\u2019s most significant text on love is the\nsigned Works of Love, a series of fifteen\n\u201cdeliberations\u201d, typically on a key New Testament passage\non love. A central issue in this text is the love that is at stake in\nthe command to love our neighbors as ourselves. The form of love that\nfor Kierkegaard is at the root of all true love is\nKjerlighed, which in many of its uses can reasonably be\nunderstood as \u201cneighbor-love\u201d and as a form of\nagape\u2014provided we understand this as a quality that\nhuman beings are capable of manifesting (albeit with a divine source),\nnot just a quality of God himself. Several deliberations contrast\nneighbor-love with forms of \u201cpreferential\u201d love (erotic\nlove [Elskov] and friendship). Contrary to what has often\nbeen claimed (e.g., Adorno 1939 [2003], L\u00f8gstrup 1956 [1997]),\nKierkegaard is not opposed to erotic love and friendship, but\nconcerned about the risks inherent within them, chiefly the way in\nwhich they may often manifest \u201cselfish\u201d forms of\nself-love. The key difference between them and neighbor-love is that\nthe preferential loves arise \u201cnaturally\u201d for humans,\nwhereas neighbor-love does not. \u201cThe neighbor\u201d includes\neveryone, and we are to strive to love all\u2014including our\nenemies. This is so counter-intuitive to the \u201cnatural\u201d\nhuman, Kierkegaard claims, that it needs to be commanded (WL\n24\u20135, SKS 9, 32\u20133). Furthermore, the duty to love must be\ngrounded in divine authority; no human authority is sufficient.\nNeighbor-love\u2014in which God is the \u201cmiddle\nterm\u201d\u2014is often portrayed as a kind of purifying agent,\nwhich is capable of transforming otherwise potentially disordered\nkinds of love and preserving \u201cthe equality of the eternal\u201d\nin love. Precisely how has been a matter of recent scholarly\ncontroversy (for contributions, building on a dispute between Ferreira\n2001 and Krishek 2009, see for instance Lippitt 2013a, Davenport 2017,\nHanson 2022). Nevertheless, Kierkegaard stresses that love is still\ngenuine even when one needs to be loved: in this sense, his\nconception of love is very different from those who would draw a hard\nand fast distinction between, say, agape and eros\n(e.g., Nygren 1930\u201336 [1953]).\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s focus on the works (or deeds) of love is\nalso key. He does not approach love simply as an occurrent feeling,\nbut as a \u201cpassion\u201d, which for him is something like a\npowerful basic disposition that can give shape to a whole life,\nexpressing itself in actions as well as in emotions. Underlying this\npassion is a certain way of seeing: Kierkegaard\u2019s is a\n\u201cvision\u201d view of love (Ferreira 2001, esp. 99\u2013116).\nFar from being a generalized form of benevolence or compassion,\nneighbor-love requires paying attention to the particular\nneighbor we encounter, seeing the other in all her distinctive\nconcreteness and specificity, and desiring what is good for that\nindividual in particular. Relatedly, love has its own epistemic\nstandards rooted in a certain generosity of spirit, a recognition that\nunderpins important discussions on how attitudes of trust or mistrust;\nhope or despair, can help or hinder our interpretation of ambiguous\nevidence about people (cf. the deliberations \u201cLove Believes all\nThings\u2014and Yet Is Never Deceived\u201d and \u201cLove Hopes\nAll Things\u2014and Yet Is Never Put to Shame\u201d.) Another\nimportant theme\u2014at the heart of the second love\ncommandment\u2014is how we should love ourselves. The\ncommandment takes it as a given that we do: like others who have\nwritten on self-love (from Aristotle and Aquinas to Harry Frankfurt),\nKierkegaard is interested in \u201cproper\u201d and\n\u201cimproper\u201d ways of doing so. To love oneself\nproperly\u2014in a non-selfish way\u2014is not only allowed but\nrequired. The neighbor, remember, includes everyone\u2014and everyone\nincludes you. An appropriate kind of hope for and trust in oneself,\nplus self- forgiveness, properly understood, may be taken to be\nimportant modes of proper self-love (Lippitt 2013a: 136\u201380).\n3.3.3 Hope and Other Virtues\n\nDespair\u2014discussed in\n \u00a72,\n \u00a73.1, and\n \u00a73.2\n above\u2014has long been recognized as a key Kierkegaardian theme.\nAlong with anxiety, it remains one of Kierkegaard\u2019s key\npsychological-religious concepts. Hope\u2014which Kierkegaard most\ncommonly discusses under the name of \u201cexpectancy\u201d\n(Forventning)\u2014may be seen as despair\u2019s\nantithesis. Indeed, it has been argued that despair is at root the\nunwillingness to hope, and that hope is essential to the task of\nbecoming a self (Bernier 2015, cf. Lippitt 2015a). On such a view,\nfaith contrasts with despair because faith includes a willingness to\nhope.\n\nIn the discourse literature, Kierkegaard explores the structure of\nvarious other virtues of the ethical\nand\u2014particularly\u2014religious life. Aside from extensive\ndiscussions of faith and love, he also explores hope, courage,\nhumility, patience, honesty, gratitude and meekness\n(Sagtmodighed), amongst others. There are also extensive\ndiscussions of such qualities as joy and contrition, and peculiarly\nKierkegaardian qualities such as (spiritual) sobriety and\n\u201cearnestness\u201d (Alvor). The philosophical task of\nunpacking these qualities is almost always in the service of the role\nthey play in the religious or specifically Christian life. While\nKierkegaard\u2019s approach to these qualities is often not\nexplicitly to talk of them as virtues (perhaps because of the negative\nresonances of talk of \u201cvirtue\u201d in his native Lutheran\ntradition\u2014but see Vos 2020), it makes sense to do so given that\neach may be thought of as contributing to the formation of character.\nBroadly in line with the classical tradition, he typically sees each\nsuch quality as involving certain ways of thinking, feeling and seeing\ncorrectly. One significant difference with the classical Greek\ntradition, however, is that Kierkegaard holds, along with many other\nChristian thinkers, that some of these human excellences cannot be\nachieved merely through human willing but require divine grace and\nassistance. There is a growing recognition of Kierkegaard as being a\nlargely untapped source of insight into understanding the role of\nnumerous virtues in the task of allowing oneself to be \u201cbuilt\nup\u201d. (See, e.g., Lippitt 2020, Roberts 2022: for a contrary\nview, skeptical about associating Kierkegaard with the virtue\ntradition, see Walsh 2018.)\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s theological concerns often influence what he says\nabout human character. One example illustrating this is his view of\nforgiveness. While forgiveness is not (unlike say anxiety or despair)\na topic to which he devotes an entire book, it is a theme that emerges\nin many places in the authorship. Although Kierkegaard\u2019s\ninterest seems to be in what it means to be a forgiving\nperson (an aspect of what it means to be a loving\nperson), the primary lens through which he views forgiveness is the\ndivine forgiveness of sins. This means that he is as interested in the\ndifficulty of our accepting forgiveness as the difficulty of\nour being able to forgive. To accept forgiveness requires\n\u201csin-consciousness:\u201d an awareness of oneself as being in\nthe wrong. For Kierkegaard, this is extremely difficult for such\nprideful creatures as we are. The capacity to forgive sin per\nse (as opposed to individual wrongs) is the \u201cchasmal\nqualitative abyss\u201d (SUD 122/SKS 11, 233) between God and\nhumanity. The refusal of God\u2019s forgiveness is itself a\nmanifestation of pride, rooted in a misguided sense of our\nself-sufficiency and a failure to recognize our radical dependency. In\nThe Sickness Unto Death, Anti-Climacus claims that the\ndespair of the forgiveness of sins is itself a sin\n(\u201coffense\u201d,) which can only be transcended in faith. This\ntheological background plays an important role in what Kierkegaard\ngoes on to claim about self-forgiveness and interpersonal forgiveness\n(such as the need to avoid such vices as pride and self-righteousness,\nand the need to cultivate \u201cbefore God\u201d such capacities as\ngenerosity of spirit, humility and hope). His fundamental approach to\nthese forms of human forgiveness, as well as the divine forgiveness in\nwhich they have their origins, is to explore them as \u201cworks of\nlove\u201d (see Lippitt 2020).\n4. Trajectories in Kierkegaard Scholarship\n\nThe vast range of Kierkegaard\u2019s influences makes the task of\nsummarizing the most important secondary literature close to\nimpossible. For the literature selected would depend upon which\napproaches to Kierkegaard the author finds most fruitful. In this\nsection, we aim to sketch some key trajectories of interpretation,\ngiving sample references of each kind of approach.\n\nOne axis along which Kierkegaard commentators may be divided is\nbetween those for whom the primary task in understanding Kierkegaard\ninvolves locating him accurately in his historical context (e.g.,\nunderstanding his complex relationship to German idealism and\nromanticism, and to contemporaries such as the Danish Hegelian Hans\nLassen Martensen), and those for whom Kierkegaard is interesting\nprimarily because of the ability his texts have to contribute to\nissues of more recent or contemporary interest (philosophical;\ntheological; literary; social or political; etc.). An excellent\nexample of the former approach would be much of the work of Jon\nStewart. For many years, Niels Thulstrup\u2019s\nKierkegaard\u2019s Relation to Hegel (1967 [1980]) was\nthought to have decisively shown that Kierkegaard took little from\nHegel. However, Stewart\u2019s Kierkegaard\u2019s Relations to\nHegel Reconsidered (2003)\u2014note the plural in the\ntitle\u2014argues convincingly that many of the targets Kierkegaard\nhad in mind in his attacks on Hegelianism were Danish followers of\nHegel who may have misunderstood or misapplied Hegel in significant\nways. Thus, Kierkegaard\u2019s relation to Hegel is much more complex\nand nuanced than has sometimes been thought. Stewart aims to show that\nKierkegaard was responding specifically to debates in 1830s and 1840s\nDenmark about Hegel\u2019s philosophy (especially its significance\nfor theology), a milieu in which Martensen was a crucial\nfigure.\n\nThis does not mean, nor does Stewart claim, that there are no\ndisagreements between Kierkegaard and Hegel. Stewart divides the\nKierkegaard corpus into three main periods: up to and including\nEither/Or (where Kierkegaard is most open to Hegel\u2019s\nphilosophy); from Fear and Trembling to the\nPostscript (where the attacks on \u201cHegelianism\u201d\nare most pronounced and polemical); and Works of Love\nonwards, where the waning of Hegel\u2019s influence in Denmark means\nthat Kierkegaard\u2019s criticism diminishes. Here a certain positive\ninfluence of Hegel re-emerges, for example in the method of The\nSickness Unto Death.\n\nCritics have disagreed as to whether Stewart\u2019s analysis closes\nthe gap between Kierkegaard and Hegel excessively, for instance\nregarding the two figures\u2019 different views of the relationship\nbetween philosophy and religion. One central issue concerns the proper\nattitude of the philosopher. As we have noted, Kierkegaard opposes a\nkind of disengaged \u201cobjective\u201d standpoint, while Hegel at\nleast in some places maintains that such an attitude is necessary for\nphilosophy to be \u201cscientific\u201d. Hegel famously claims that\n\u201cphilosophy should beware of the wish to be edifying\u201d\n(Hegel 1977: 6; originally published 1807), which seems directly\ncontrary to the Kierkegaardian claim at the end of Either/Or\nII: \u201cOnly the truth that edifies is truth for you\u201d\n(EO II, 354, translation modified/ SKS 3,331). Another point of\ntension is the Hegelian aim to produce a \u201csystem\u201d\nencompassing the whole of reality, whereas Kierkegaard\u2019s\npseudonym Johannes Climacus insists that a system of existence is\nimpossible for anyone but God (CUP I, 118\u2013125/SKS 7, 114\n-120).\n\nStewart later went on to become general editor of a monumental series:\nKierkegaard Research: Sources, Reception, and Resources,\nwhich includes a huge amount of work of this historically oriented\ntype (amongst others). Michelle Kosch\u2019s work on Kierkegaard in\nrelation to German idealism (Kosch 2006) is another exemplary instance\nof historically oriented work, while Fred Rush\u2019s book on\nKierkegaard in relation to romanticism (esp. Schlegel) and idealism\n(esp. Hegel) also provides helpful historical context (Rush 2016).\n\nExamples of the less historically oriented type of Kierkegaard\nscholarship are highly varied. Some have looked to Kierkegaard as a\nkind of proto-Derrida, a deconstructionist avant la lettre\n(e.g., Poole 1993; for an overview of deconstructionist and\npostmodernist readings of Kierkegaard which does not conflate the two,\nsee Shakespeare 2013). Similarly, the question has been raised as to\nwhether Kierkegaard can plausibly be read as a proto-phenomenologist\ndespite preceding Husserl (e.g., Hanson 2010; see also Welz 2013).\nOthers have seen some intriguing commonalities between Kierkegaard and\nWittgenstein, either the Tractatus or later writings,\nsometimes focusing on the ostensibly narrow but (it is claimed)\nultimately deeply significant question of how we should read the\n\u201crevocation\u201d of the Postscript, and what this\nreveals about the proper method of philosophy with regard to religious\nquestions (e.g., Cavell 1969; Conant 1989, 1993, 1995; Lippitt &\nHutto 1998; Phillips 1999; Mulhall 2001; Sch\u00f6nbaumsfeld 2007).\nMacIntyre\u2019s claims about Kierkegaard\u2019s proper place in the\nhistory of philosophy\u2014allegedly, as a critical figure in the\nfailure of the Enlightenment\u2019s attempt to offer a rational\njustification of morality\u2014spawned a veritable scholarly\nsub-industry, not only aiming to show where MacIntyre was wrong in his\ninterpretation of Kierkegaard, but of how Kierkegaard in fact\nanticipated many highly MacIntyrean themes. As noted above, a central\nfocus of debate has been whether Kierkegaard may be read\u2014like\nMacIntyre\u2014as a proponent of a narrative-based account of\npractical identity, where a \u201cnarrative structure\u201d is\nneeded to make a human life intelligible, actions and intentions\nneeding to be located in a temporal, social and teleological context\nin order to be understood. However, this may be seen as part of a\nbroader school of interpretation, which finds some intriguing\nparallels between Kierkegaard and several major recent anglophone\nmoral philosophers. Besides MacIntyre, these would include Harry\nFrankfurt (see, e.g., Mooney 1996, esp. 65\u201376 and the essays in\nRudd and Davenport 2015); Iris Murdoch (e.g., Martens 2012); Charles\nTaylor (e.g., Khan 2012) and Bernard Williams (e.g., Mooney 1996, esp.\n65\u201376, Compaijen 2018). The shift in moral philosophy during the\nlater decades of the twentieth century and into the\ntwenty-first\u2014from mid-1900s concerns about the nature of ethical\nlanguage and debates about realism versus anti-realism in ethics, to\nbroader concerns about what makes human lives meaningful, the nature\nof human flourishing, and the moral psychology of the\nvirtues\u2014has been seen by many Kierkegaard scholars as a move\n(albeit mostly an unwitting one) in the direction of more\n\u201cKierkegaardian\u201d concerns. Within this school of\ninterpretation, some key claims have been that Kierkegaard holds a\nteleological view of the self; a belief that the quest for\n\u201cnarrative unity\u201d is an important element in achieving\nethical selfhood; and a rich view of the virtues (Davenport and Rudd\n2001; Davenport 2012; Rudd 2012). Even skeptics about the second view\n(e.g., Lippitt 2007, 2015b) have tended to agree on the first and\nthird.\n\nAnother major fault line in Kierkegaard scholarship concerns the\ndivide between scholars who take Kierkegaard\u2019s Christian\ncommitments seriously and those who find them something of an\nembarrassment, and whose approach to the texts seems to be to ask what\ncan be salvaged despite these commitments. The former approach is\nexemplified in much of the work of Evans (1983, 1992, 2009, 2019),\nwhich has consistently tried to show that Kierkegaard\u2019s writings\ncan be helpful in making sense of the religious life in general and\nChristianity in particular. The latter type of work has sometimes\ntaken the form of reading Kierkegaard \u201cagainst\nKierkegaard\u201d (e.g., Adorno 1933 [1989], Theunissen 1993 [2005]).\nFinally, quite a bit of work has also been done on Kierkegaard\u2019s\nview of women and gender (see for instance Walsh 2022.)\n5. Conclusion\n\nKierkegaard is a beguiling but frustrating thinker, full of\nprovocations and insights but also difficult to nail down. He has thus\nbeen interpreted in many\u2014often incompatible\u2014ways, and this\nis likely to continue to be so. Much of his thought remains highly\nrelevant to our day, including his critique of mass society and\nconformism, and his attempt to show emotions and passions as essential\nelements of authentic human life. In his writings on ethical and\nreligious life, he tries to show that a disengaged, objective stance,\nfar from facilitating knowledge, is a barrier to knowing the truth.\nHis perspective on religion and society is likely to elicit objections\nfrom opposite sides of the contemporary political spectrum, since he\nsharply criticizes \u201cChristendom\u201d, including contemporary\nversions of Christian nationalism (see, e.g., Backhouse 2011), while\nalso rejecting the claim of some liberals that religion should be\nexcluded from our common life, which requires a supposedly neutral,\ndisengaged stance that Kierkegaard sees as neither possible nor\ndesirable. If the\n\u201canalytic\u201d\u2014\u201ccontinental\u201d distinction\nstill has any value, then Kierkegaard has appealed to philosophers on\nboth sides, sometimes providing fine conceptual analyses yet also\ndoing philosophy in a highly literary mode. He himself can be seen as\n\u201cthat individual\u201d to whom he dedicated many of his works,\na writer who succeeded in his goal of communicating\n\u201cindirectly\u201d, in a manner that demands\n\u201csubjective\u201d engagement if his work is to be read to\nmaximum advantage.\nChronology of Kierkegaard\u2019s Works\n\n1838\n\n\nFrom the Papers of One Still Living.
