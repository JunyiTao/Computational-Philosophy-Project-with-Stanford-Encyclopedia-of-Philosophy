    "main_text": "\nHenry Nelson Goodman (1906\u20131998) was one of the most\ninfluential philosophers of the post-war era of American philosophy.\nGoodman\u2019s philosophical interests ranged from formal logic and the\nphilosophy of science to the philosophy of art. In all these diverse\nfields Goodman made significant and highly original contributions.\nPerhaps his most famous contribution is the\n\u201cgrue-paradox\u201d, which points to the problem that in order\nto learn by induction, we need to make a distinction between\nprojectible and non-projectible predicates.  Other important\ncontributions include his description of the technique which would\nlater be called \u201creflective equilibrium\u201d, his\ninvestigation of counterfactuals, his \u201cirrealism\u201d, his\ndevelopment of mereology (with Henry S. Leonard), a nominalistic\naccount of logical syntax (with W.V. Quine), his contribution to the\ncognitive turn in aesthetics, and his general theory of symbols.\nIn this article we focus on Goodman\u2019s life, conception of\nphilosophy, philosophy of science, logic, language, and mathematics,\nand metaphysics. For Goodman\u2019s theory of symbols and philosophy of art\nsee the separate entry on\n Goodman\u2019s Aesthetics.\n",
