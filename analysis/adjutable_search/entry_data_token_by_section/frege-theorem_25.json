Philosophical Questions Surrounding Frege\u2019s Theorem\n\nAs we\u2019ve now seen, the proof of Frege\u2019s Theorem can be carried\nout independently of the portion of Frege\u2019s system which led to\ninconsistency. Frege himself never identified \u201cFrege\u2019s\nTheorem\u201d as a \u201cresult\u201d. As previously noted, he\nattempted to derive Hume\u2019s Principle from Basic Law V in\nGg, but once the contradiction became known to him,\nhe never officially retreated to the \u2018fall-back\u2019 position\nof claiming that the proof of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from\nHume\u2019s Principle alone constituted an important result. One of\nseveral reasons why he didn\u2019t adopt this fall-back position is\nthat he didn\u2019t regard Hume\u2019s Principle as a sufficiently\ngeneral principle \u2013 he didn\u2019t believe it was strong\nenough, from an epistemological point of view, to help us answer the\nquestion, \u201cHow are numbers given to us?\u201d. We discuss the\nthinking behind this attitude, and other things, in what follows.\n\nA discussion of the philosophical questions surrounding Frege\u2019s\nTheorem should begin with some statement of how Frege conceived of his\nown project when writing Begr, Gl,\nand Gg. It seems clear that epistemological\nconsiderations in part motivated Frege\u2019s work on the foundations\nof mathematics. It is well documented that Frege had the following\ngoal, namely, to explain our knowledge of the basic laws of arithmetic\nby giving an answer to the question \u201cHow are numbers\n\u2018given\u2019 to us?\u201d without making an appeal to the\nfaculty of intuition. If Frege could show that the basic laws of\nnumber theory are derivable from analytic truths of logic, then he\ncould argue that we need only appeal to the faculty of understanding\n(as opposed to some faculty of intuition) to explain our knowledge of\nthe truths of arithmetic. Frege\u2019s goal then stands in contrast\nto the Kantian view of the exact mathematical sciences, according to\nwhich general principles of reasoning must be supplemented by a\nfaculty of intuition if we are to achieve mathematical knowledge. The\nKantian model here is that of geometry; Kant thought that our\nintuitions of figures and constructions played an essential role in\nthe demonstrations of geometrical theorems. (In Frege\u2019s own\ntime, the achievements of Frege\u2019s contemporaries Pasch (1882),\nPeano (1889b), Pieri (1898), and Hilbert (1899) showed that such\nintuitions were not essential.)\n",
