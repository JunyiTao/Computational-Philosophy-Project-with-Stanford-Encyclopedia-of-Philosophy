    "main_text": "Personality and Legacy || Le\u015bniewski as a Person\n6.2 Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Legacy\n\n \nOf the students that Le\u015bniewski had taught at Warsaw, some went\non to logical and philosophical careers of their own, most notably\nTarski, whom Le\u015bniewski correctly recognized as a genius, and who\nwent on to outshine his teacher. Among those who stayed fairly close\nto Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own views were Jerzy S\u0142upecki, Boles\u0142aw\nSoboci\u0144ski, Czes\u0142aw Lejewski, and Henry Hi\u017c. The first\nthree in particular contributed after World War II to the\nreconstruction of many of the logical results that had been lost in\n1944. Serendipitously recovered students\u2019 notes from\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s lectures, translated and published in 1988, give\nsome idea of the detail of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s teaching, but his\nlectures ranged more widely than the extant works show. At all times\nhowever, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s logical position was a minority one, which\nwas respected while being rejected, and it won few converts after his\ndeath. The reasons for his sidelining have been analysed by\nGrzegorczyk (1955). Le\u015bniewski\u2019s work was developed in the 1920s\nwhen an axiomatic approach was standard, as in Hilbert\u2019s school, but\nhis negative attitude to semantics as a separable part of logic meant\nhe was unsympathetic to the shift towards a semantic approach\ninitiated by Tarski, and he would have remained opposed even had he\nlived longer. His vituperative rejection of set theory made him no\nfriends and many enemies among mathematicians, while his unwillingness\nand inability to find anything worthwhile in the works of philosophers\nlost him their sympathy. His obsessive concern for the minute detail\nof axiomatizations was unattractive to many when more streamlined\nmethods were available, and his radical nominalism made the\npresentation of logic according to his principles a matter of extreme\ninconvenience. Even Tarski, who was initially very much a follower,\nhad to admit that Le\u015bniewski\u2019s conception of logical systems as\nconcrete collections of inscriptions growing in time through the\naddition of new theses made them \u201cthoroughly unrewarding objects\nfor methodological and semantic research\u201d.\n\n In retrospect we can see Le\u015bniewski\u2019s obsession with the\nfine detail of axiomatics and his rejection of semantics as conditioned\nby his own idiosyncratic development and the predominant research\ninterests of the 1910s and 1920s. It is in fact possible to apply more\nstandard metalogical considerations to his systems, such as\ninvestigating them for consistency and completeness. However, the\ndifficulties and complications of working within the confines of a\nfully nominalistic attitude\u2014sans sets, sans\nabstract expression types\u2014have put off all but a very few, and\nthe relative ease with which results can be obtained when fewer\nontological scruples are in play makes Le\u015bniewski\u2019s systems\nand others like them interesting mainly to certain philosophers, while\nmathematicians and mathematical logicians have by-passed them.\n\n On the other hand, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s concerns for the proprieties\nof quotation and use/mention, the object-language/metalanguage\ndistinction, canons of correct definition, and his development of\nMereology as the dominant formal theory of part and whole have all\npassed into the mainstream, and the logical expertise he helped to\ninstil into a generation of Poles contributed in large part to making\nWarsaw the premier interbellum location for mathematical logic. In the\nentrance to the 1999 University of Warsaw Library building stand four\nconcrete pillars and sculptures by Adam Myjak, celebrating the\nphilosophical achievements of Poland. The figures represented are\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s teacher Twardowski, his colleague\n\u0141ukasiewicz, his student Tarski, and Le\u015bniewski himself.\n",
