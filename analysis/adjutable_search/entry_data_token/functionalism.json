What is Functionalism?\n\nFunctionalism is the doctrine that what makes something a thought,\ndesire, pain (or any other type of mental state) depends not on its\ninternal constitution, but solely on its function, or the role it\nplays, in the cognitive system of which it is a part. More precisely,\nfunctionalist theories take the identity of a mental state to be\ndetermined by its causal relations to sensory stimulations, other\nmental states, and behavior.\n\nFor (an avowedly simplistic) example, a functionalist theory might\ncharacterize pain as the state that tends to be caused by\nbodily injury, to produce the belief that something is wrong with the\nbody and the desire to be out of that state, to produce anxiety, and,\nin the absence of any stronger, conflicting desires, to cause wincing\nor moaning. According to this theory, all and only creatures with\ninternal states that can meet this condition, or play this role, are\ncapable of being in pain, and an individual is in pain at time\nt if and only if they are in a state that is playing this\nrole at t.\n\nSuppose that, in humans, there is some distinctive kind of neural\nactivity (C-fiber stimulation, for example) that plays this role. If\nso, then according to this functionalist theory, humans can be in pain\nsimply by undergoing C-fiber stimulation. But the theory permits\ncreatures with very different physical constitutions to have mental\nstates as well: if there are silicon-based states of hypothetical\nMartians or inorganic states of hypothetical androids that also meet\nthese conditions, then these creatures, too, can be in pain. As\nfunctionalists often put it, pain can be realized by\ndifferent types of physical states in different kinds of creatures, or\nmultiply realized. (See entry on\n multiple realizability.)\n Indeed, since descriptions that make explicit reference only to a\nstate\u2019s causal relations with stimulations, behavior, and one\nanother are what have come to be known as \u201ctopic-neutral\u201d\n(Smart 1959) \u2013 that is, as imposing no logical restrictions on\nthe nature of the items that satisfy the descriptions \u2013 then\nit\u2019s also logically possible for non-physical states to\nplay the relevant roles, and thus realize mental states, in some\nsystems as well. So functionalism is compatible with the sort of\ndualism that takes mental states to cause, and be caused by, physical\nstates.\n\nStill, though functionalism is officially neutral between materialism\nand dualism, it has been particularly attractive to materialists,\nsince many materialists believe (or argue; see Lewis, 1966) that it is\noverwhelmingly likely that any states capable of playing the roles in\nquestion will be physical states. If so, then functionalism can stand\nas a materialistic alternative to the Psycho-Physical Identity Thesis\n(introduced in Place 1956, Feigl 1958, and Smart 1959, and defended\nmore recently in Hill 1991, and Polger 2011), which holds that each\ntype of mental state is identical with a particular type of\nneural state. This thesis seems to entail that no creatures\nwith brains unlike ours can share our sensations, beliefs, and\ndesires, no matter how similar their behavior and internal\norganization may be to our own, and thus functionalism, with its claim\nthat mental states can be multiply realized, has been regarded as\nproviding a more inclusive, less \u201c(species-) chauvinistic\u201d\n(Block 1980b) \u2013 theory of the mind that is compatible with\nmaterialism. (More recently, however, some philosophers have contended\nthat the identity thesis may be more inclusive than functionalists\nassume; see Section 6 for further discussion.)\n\nWithin this broad characterization of functionalism, however, a number\nof distinctions can be made. One of particular importance is the\ndistinction between theories in which the functional characterizations\nof mental states purport to provide analyses of the meanings of our\nmental state terms (or otherwise restrict themselves to a priori\ninformation), and theories that permit functional characterizations of\nmental states to appeal to information deriving from scientific\nexperimentation (or speculation). (See Shoemaker 1984c, and Rey 1997,\nfor further discussion and more fine-grained distinctions.) There are\nother important differences among functionalist theories as well.\nThese (sometimes orthogonal) differences, and the motivations for\nthem, can best be appreciated by examining the origins of\nfunctionalism and tracing its evolution in response both to explicit\ncriticisms of the thesis and changing views about the nature of\npsychological explanation.\n2. Antecedents of Functionalism\n\nAlthough functionalism attained its greatest prominence as a theory of\nmental states in the last third of the 20th century, it has\nantecedents in both modern and ancient philosophy, as well as in early\ntheories of computation and artificial intelligence.\n2.1 Early Antecedents\n\nThe earliest view in the Western canon that can be considered an\nancestor of functionalism is Aristotle\u2019s theory of the soul (350\nBCE). In contrast to Plato\u2019s claim that the soul can exist apart\nfrom the body, Aristotle argued (De Anima Bk. II, Ch. 1) that\nthe (human) soul is the form of a natural, organized human\nbody \u2013 the set of powers or capacities that enable it to express\nits \u201cessential whatness\u201d, which for Aristotle is a matter\nof fulfilling the function or purpose that defines it as the kind of\nthing it is. Just as the form of an axe is whatever enables it to cut,\nand the form of an eye is whatever enables it to see, the (human) soul\nis to be identified with whichever powers and capacities enable a\nnatural, organized human body to fulfill its defining function, which,\naccording to Aristotle, is to survive and flourish as a living,\nacting, perceiving, and reasoning being. So, Aristotle argues, the\nsoul is inseparable from the body, and comprises whichever capacities\nare required for a body to live, perceive, reason, and act. (See\nShields, 1990, and Nelson, 1990, for further debate about whether\nAristotle\u2019s view can be considered to be a version of\nfunctionalism.)\n\nA second, relatively early, ancestor of contemporary functionalism is\nHobbes\u2019s (1651) account of reasoning as a kind of computation\nthat proceeds by mechanistic principles comparable to the rules of\narithmetic. Reasoning, he argues, is \u201cnothing but\nreckoning, that is adding and subtracting, of the\nconsequences of general names agreed upon for the marking and\nsignifying of our thoughts.\u201d (Leviathan, Ch.\n5) In addition, Hobbes suggests that reasoning \u2013 along with\nimagining, sensing, and deliberating about action, all of which\nproceed according to mechanistic principles \u2013 can be performed\nby systems of various physical types. As he puts it in his\nIntroduction to Leviathan, where he likens a commonwealth to\nan individual human, \u201cwhy may we not say that all automata\n(engines that move themselves by springs and wheels\u2026) have an\nartificial life? For what is the heart but a spring; and the nerves\nbut so many strings, and the joints but so many wheels\u2026\u201d.\nIt was not until the middle of the 20th century, however, that it\nbecame common to speculate that thinking may be nothing more than\nrule-governed computation that can be carried out by creatures of\nvarious physical types.\n2.2 Thinking Machines and the \u201cTuring Test\u201d\n\nIn a seminal paper (Turing 1950), A.M. Turing proposed that the\nquestion, \u201cCan machines think?\u201d can be replaced by the\nquestion, \u201cIs it theoretically possible for a finite state\ndigital computer, provided with a large but finite table of\ninstructions, or program, to provide responses to questions that would\nfool an unknowing interrogator into thinking it is a human\nbeing?\u201d Now, in deference to its author, this question is most\noften expressed as \u201cIs it theoretically possible for a Turing\nmachine (appropriately programmed) to pass the Turing Test?\u201d\n(See the entry on the\n Turing Test.)\n\nIn arguing that this question is a legitimate replacement for the\noriginal (and speculating that its answer is \u201cyes\u201d),\nTuring identifies thoughts with states of a system defined solely by\ntheir roles in producing further internal states and verbal outputs,\ngiven certain verbal inputs \u2013 a view on which, like\nHobbes\u2019s and subsequent functionalist theories \u2013 many\nphysically different systems could have internal states that play\nthese roles. Indeed, Turing\u2019s work was explicitly invoked by\nmany theorists during the beginning stages of 20th century\nfunctionalism, and was the avowed inspiration for a class of theories,\nthe \u201cmachine state\u201d theories most firmly associated with\nHilary Putnam (1960, 1967) that had an important role in the early\ndevelopment of the doctrine.\n2.3 Behaviorism\n\nOther important recent antecedents of functionalism are the\nbehaviorist theories that emerged in the early-to-mid twentieth\ncentury. These include both the \u201clogical\u201d or\n\u201canalytical\u201d behaviorism of philosophers such as Malcolm\n(1968) and Ryle (1949) (and, arguably, Wittgenstein 1953) and the\nempirical psychological theories associated primarily with Watson and\nSkinner. \n\nLogical behaviorism is a thesis about the meanings of our mental state\nterms or concepts \u2013 in particular, that all statements about\nmental states and processes are equivalent in meaning to statements\nabout behavioral dispositions. So, for (again, an overly simplified)\nexample, \u201cHenry has a toothache\u201d would be equivalent in\nmeaning to a statement such as \u201cHenry is disposed (all things\nbeing equal) to cry out or moan and to rub his jaw\u201d. And\n\u201cAmelia is thirsty\u201d would be equivalent to a statement\nsuch as \u201cIf Amelia is offered some water, she will be disposed\n(all things being equal) to drink it.\u201d These candidate\ntranslations, like all behavioristic statements, eschew reference to\nany internal states of the organism, and thus do not threaten to\ndenote, or otherwise induce commitment to, properties or processes\n(directly) observable only by introspection. In addition, logical\nbehaviorists argued that if statements about mental states were\nequivalent in meaning to statements about behavioral dispositions,\nthere could be an unproblematic account of how mental state terms\ncould be applied both to oneself and others, and how they could be\ntaught and learned. \n\nIn contrast, scientific behaviorism is an empirical theory that\nattempts to explain the behavior of humans (and other animals) by\nappealing solely to behavioral dispositions, that is, to the lawlike\ntendencies of organisms to behave in certain ways, given certain\nenvironmental stimulations. Stimulations and behavior, unlike\nthoughts, feelings, and other internal states that can be directly\nobserved only by introspection, are objectively observable, and are\nindisputably part of the natural world. Thus behavioral dispositions\nseemed to be fit entities to figure centrally in the emerging science\nof psychology, allowing for a science of human behavior as objective\nand explanatory as other \u201chigher-level\u201d sciences such as\nchemistry and biology. Also, behaviorist theories promised to avoid a\npotential regress that appeared to threaten psychological explanations\ninvoking internal representations, namely, that to specify how such\nrepresentations produce the behaviors in question, one must appeal to\nan internal intelligent agent (a \u201chomunculus\u201d) who\ninterprets the representations, and whose skills would themselves have\nto be explained.\n\nBoth varieties of behaviorism, however, faced a common problem.\n\nAs many philosophers have pointed out (e.g. Chisholm 1957; Geach\n1957), logical behaviorism provides an implausible account of the\nmeanings of our mental state terms, since, intuitively, a subject can\nhave the mental states in question without the relevant behavioral\ndispositions \u2013 and vice versa. For example, Gene may believe\nthat it\u2019s going to rain even if he\u2019s not disposed to wear\na raincoat and take an umbrella when leaving the house (or to perform\nany other cluster of rain-avoiding behaviors), if Gene doesn\u2019t\nmind, or actively enjoys, singing in the rain. And subjects with the\nrequisite motivation can suppress their tendencies to pain behavior\neven in the presence of excruciating pain, while skilled actors can\nperfect the lawlike disposition to produce pain behavior under certain\nconditions, even if they don\u2019t actually feel pain. (See e.g.\nPutnam 1965) The problem, these philosophers argued, is that no mental\nstate, by itself, can plausibly be assumed to give rise to any\nparticular behavior unless one also assumes that the subject possesses\nadditional mental states of various types. And so, it seemed, it is\nnot in fact possible to give meaning-preserving translations of\nstatements invoking pains, beliefs, and desires in purely\nbehavioristic terms; one needs to include reference to the\nsubject\u2019s other mental states as well. Nonetheless, the idea\nthat our common sense concepts of mental states reveal an essential\ntie between mental states and their typical behavioral expressions is\nretained, and elaborated, in contemporary \u201canalytic\u201d\nfunctionalist theories.\n\nScientific behaviorism faced similar challenges. The theories of\nWatson, Skinner, et al had some early successes, especially in the\ndomain of animal learning, and its principles are still used, at least\nfor heuristic purposes, in various areas of psychology. But as many\npsychologists (and others, e.g. Chomsky 1959) have argued, the\nsuccesses of behaviorism seem to depend upon the experimenters\u2019\nimplicit control of certain variables which, when made explicit,\ninvolve ineliminable reference to organisms\u2019 other mental\nstates. For example, rats are typically placed into an experimental\nsituation at a certain fraction of their normal body weight \u2013\nand thus can be assumed to feel hunger and to\nwant the food rewards contingent upon behaving in certain\nways. Similarly, it is assumed that humans, in analogous experimental\nsituations, want to cooperate with the experimenters, and\nunderstand and know how to follow the instructions. It seemed\nto the critics of behaviorism, therefore, that theories that\nexplicitly appeal to an organism\u2019s beliefs, desires, and other\nmental states, as well as to stimulations and behavior, would provide\na fuller and more accurate account of why organisms behave as they do.\nThey could do so, moreover, without compromising the objectivity of\npsychology as long as the mental states to which these theories appeal\nare introduced as states that together play a role in the\nproduction of behavior, rather than states identifiable solely by\nintrospection. Thus work was begun on a range of\n\u201ccognitive\u201d psychological theories which reflected these\npresumptions, and an important strain of contemporary functionalism,\n\u201cpsychofunctionalism\u201d (Fodor 1968, Block and Fodor 1972)\ncan be seen a philosophical endorsement of these new cognitive\ntheories of mind.\n3. Varieties of Functionalism\n\nGiven this history, it is helpful to think of functionalist theories\nas belonging to one of three major strains \u2013 \u201cmachine\nstate functionalism\u201d, \u201canalytic functionalism\u201d, and\n\u201cpsychofunctionalism\u201d \u2013 and to see them as emerging,\nrespectively, from early AI theories, empirical behaviorism, and\nlogical behaviorism. It\u2019s important to recognize, however, that\nthere is at least some overlap in the bloodlines of these different\nstrains of functionalism, and also that there are functionalist\ntheories, both earlier and more recent, that fall somewhere in\nbetween. For example, Wilfrid Sellars\u2019s (1956) account of mental\nstates as \u201ctheoretical entities\u201d is widely regarded as an\nimportant early version of functionalism, but it takes the proper\ncharacterization of thoughts and experiences to depend partially on\ntheir role in providing a scientific explanation of behavior, and\npartly on what he calls the \u201clogic\u201d, or the a priori\ninterrelations, of the relevant concepts. Still, it is instructive to\ngive separate treatment to the three major strains of the doctrine, as\nlong as these caveats are kept in mind.\n3.1 Machine State Functionalism\n\nThe early functionalist theories of Putnam (1960, 1967; see also Block\nand Fodor 1972) can be seen as a response to the difficulties facing\nbehaviorism as a scientific psychological theory, and as an\nendorsement of the (new) computational theories of mind which were\nbecoming increasingly significant rivals to it. (But see Putnam 1988,\nfor subsequent doubts about machine functionalism, Chalmers 1996b, for\na response, and Shagrir 2005, for a comprehensive account of the\nevolution of Putnam\u2019s views on the subject)\n\nAccording to machine state functionalism, any creature with a\nmind can be regarded as a Turing machine (an idealized finite state\ndigital computer), whose operation can be fully specified by a set of\ninstructions (a \u201cmachine table\u201d or program) having the\nform:\n\nIf the machine is in state Si, and receives input\nIj, it will go into state Sk\nand produce output Ol (for a finite number of\nstates, inputs and outputs). \n\nA machine table of this sort describes the operation of a\ndeterministic automaton, but most machine state\nfunctionalists (e.g. Putnam 1967) take the proper model for the mind\nto be that of a probabilistic automaton: one in which the\nprogram specifies, for each state and set of inputs, the\nprobability with which the machine will enter some subsequent\nstate and produce some particular output.\n\nOn either model, however, the mental states of a creature are to be\nidentified with such \u201cmachine table states\u201d\n(S1,\u2026,Sn). These states\nare not mere behavioral dispositions, since they are specified in\nterms of their relations not only to inputs and outputs, but also to\nthe state of the machine at the time. For example, if believing it\nwill rain is regarded as a machine state, it will not be regarded\nas a disposition to take one\u2019s umbrella after looking at the\nweather report, but rather as a disposition to take one\u2019s\numbrella if one looks at the weather report and is in the\nstate of wanting to stay dry. So machine state functionalism can avoid\nwhat many have thought to be a fatal difficulty for behaviorism. In\naddition, machines of this sort provide at least a simple model of how\ninternal states whose effects on output occur by means of mechanical\nprocesses can be viewed as representations (though the\nquestion of what, exactly, they represent has been an ongoing\ntopic of discussion (see sections 4.4\u20135). Finally, machine table\nstates are not tied to any particular physical (or other) realization;\nthe same program, after all, can be run on different sorts of computer\nhardware.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see, therefore, why Turing machines provided a\nfruitful model for early functionalist theories. And the idea that\nmental states are best regarded as computational states appears in\nmany theories of the mind (see, for example, Rey 1997; but see\nPiccinini 2004 for dissent and the entry on the\n computational theory of mind\n for a comprehensive discussion of this question). Nonetheless,\nbecause machine table states are total states of a system, most\ncontemporary functionalists \u2013 both analytic functionalists and\npsychofunctionalists \u2013 have adopted another way of\ncharacterizing mental states, namely, as states implicitly defined by\nthe co-called Ramsey-sentence of a psychological theory \u2013 either\none that derives from our commonly held beliefs about the causal roles\nof mental states in the production of behavior, or from the results of\nempirical psychological investigation. This will be the focus of the\nnext section.\n3.2 Functional Definitions and Ramsey-sentences\n\nThe key feature of this now-canonical method, presented initially by\nDavid Lewis (1972), building on a technique introduced by Frank\nRamsey, is to treat mental state terms as being implicitly defined by\nthe so-called Ramsey sentence of one or another psychological\ntheory \u2013 common sense, scientific, or something in between.\n(Analogous steps, of course, can be taken to produce the\nRamsey-sentence of any theory, psychological or otherwise).\nFor (a still simplistic) example, consider the sort of generalizations\nabout pain introduced before: pain tends to be caused by bodily\ninjury; pain tends to produce the belief that something is wrong with\nthe body and the desire to be out of that state; pain tends to produce\nanxiety; pain tends to produce wincing or moaning.\n\nTo construct the Ramsey-sentence of this \u201ctheory\u201d, the\nfirst step is to conjoin these generalizations, then to replace all\nnames of different types of mental states with different variables,\nand then to existentially quantify those variables, as follows:\n\n\u2203x\u2203y\u2203z\u2203w(x\ntends to be caused by bodily injury & x tends to produce\nstates y, z, and w & x tends\nto produce wincing or moaning). \n\nSuch a statement is free of any mental state terms. It includes only\nquantifiers that range over mental states, terms that denote\nstimulations and behavior, and terms that specify various causal\nrelations among them. It can thus be regarded as providing implicit\ndefinitions of the mental state terms of the theory. An individual\nwill have those mental states just in case it possesses a family of\nfirst-order states that interact in the ways specified by the theory.\n(Though functionalists of course acknowledge that the first-order\nstates that satisfy the functional definitions may vary from species\nto species \u2013 or even from individual to individual \u2013 they\nspecify that, for each individual, the functional definitions be\nuniquely satisfied.)\n\nA helpful way to think of the Ramsey sentence of a psychological\ntheory is to regard it as defining a system\u2019s mental states\n\u201call at once\u201d as states that interact with stimulations in\nvarious ways to produce behavior (See Lewis 1972; also see Field 1980\nfor a more technical elaboration of Lewis\u2019s method, and an\naccount of some crucial differences between this kind of\ncharacterization and the one Lewis initially proposed.) It is also\nhelpful to view the differences between analytic and\npsychofunctionalism as differences in the Ramsey-sentences of our\n\u201ccommonsense theory of the mind\u201d versus our empirical\npsychological theories of the roles of mental states in the production\nof other mental states and behavior.\n3.3 Analytic Functionalism\n\nLike the logical behaviorism from which it emerged, the goal of\nanalytic functionalism is to provide dispositional, or other\n\u201ctopic-neutral\u201d, translations or analyses of our ordinary\nmental state terms or concepts. Analytic functionalism, of course, has\nricher resources than logical behaviorism for such translations, since\nit permits reference to certain causal and transitional relations that\na mental state has to stimulations, behavior, and other mental\nstates. So, for example, the statement \u201cBlanca wants some\ncoffee\u201d need not be rendered, as logical behaviorism requires,\nin terms such as \u201cBlanca is disposed to order coffee when it is\noffered\u201d, but rather as \u201cBlanca is disposed to order\ncoffee when it is offered, if she has no stronger desire to\navoid coffee\u201d. But any theory \u2013 and its Ramsey-sentence\n\u2013 that is acceptable to analytic functionalists must include\nonly generalizations about mental states, their environmental causes,\nand their joint effects on behavior that are so widely known and\n\u201cplatitudinous\u201d to count as analyzing our ordinary\nconcepts of the mental states in question. (See Smart 1959,\nArmstrong 1968, Shoemaker 1984a,b,c, Lewis 1972, and Braddon-Mitchell\nand Jackson 1996/2007.) \n\nA major question, of course, is whether a theory that limits itself to\nsuch \u201cplatitudes\u201d about the causal relations between\nstimulations, mental states, and behavior can make the right\ndistinctions among mental states, or even worse, is so\n\u201cliberal\u201d that it can be realized by systems without any\nsort of mentality at all, such as the economy of Bolivia (Block,\n1980b). However, commonsense psychology has more resources than it may\ninitially seem. First, (at least arguably) it need not be restricted\nto the \u201cplatitudes\u201d that can be accessed immediately; it\nmay take a certain amount of Socratic questioning to prompt us to\nrecognize certain similarities and differences among the\ncausal-relational properties of our mental states. The information\naccessed by such questioning, however, was always available to us, at\nleast in principle, and so can count as the deliverances of common\nsense, rather than empirical investigation. Moreover \u2013 and\ncontrary to the claims of some theorists (e.g. Churchland, 1981)\n\u2013 commonsense psychology is not stagnant. It can, over time,\nabsorb information acquired by exposure to empirical theories, while\nnonetheless retaining its platitudinous status. (Not that this is\nalways a good thing: think, for example, of how Freudian theory and\nvarious now discredited theories about the causes of autism,\ndepression, and impulsive behavior once seemed to be the deliverances\nof common sense.)\n\nNonetheless, many functionalists argue that commonsense theories do\nnot have sufficient resources to capture the causal roles of the\ninternal states that differentiate us from other cognitive (and\nnon-cognitive) systems. They look instead to a more empirically\ninformed, and presumably more restrictive, theory of mental states and\ntheir effects on behavior \u2013 psychofunctionalism \u2013 that\nderives primarily from reflection upon the goals and methodology of\nthe \u201ccognitive\u201d psychological theories that are the\ndescendants of scientific behaviorism.\n3.4 Psychofunctionalism\n\nIn contrast to the scientific behaviorists\u2019 insistence that the\nlaws of psychology appeal only to behavioral dispositions, cognitive\npsychologists argue that the best empirical theories of behavior take\nit to be the result of a complex of mental states and processes,\nintroduced and individuated in terms of the roles they play in\nproducing the behavior to be explained. For example (Fodor\u2019s, in\nhis 1968, Ch. 3), a psychologist may begin to construct a theory of\nmemory by postulating the existence of \u201cmemory trace\u201d\ndecay, a process whose occurrence or absence is responsible for\neffects such as memory loss and retention, and which is affected by\nstress or emotion in certain distinctive ways.\n\nOn a theory of this sort, what makes some neural process an instance\nof memory trace decay is a matter of how it functions, or the role it\nplays, in a cognitive system; its neural or chemical properties are\nrelevant only insofar as they enable that process to do what trace\ndecay is hypothesized to do. And similarly for all mental states and\nprocesses invoked by cognitive psychological theories. Cognitive\npsychology, that is, is intended by its proponents to be a\n\u201chigher-level\u201d science like biology, and thus to have\nautonomy from lower-level sciences such as neurophysiology: just as,\nin biology, physically disparate entities can all be hearts as long as\nthey function to circulate blood in a living organism, and physically\ndisparate entities can all be eyes as long as they enable an organism\nto see, disparate physical structures or processes can be instances of\nmemory trace decay \u2013 or more familiar phenomena such as\nthoughts, sensations, and desires \u2013 as long as they play the\nroles described by the relevant cognitive theory.\n\nPsychofunctionalism, therefore, can be seen as straightforwardly\nadopting the methodology of cognitive psychology in its\ncharacterization of mental states and processes as entities defined by\ntheir role in a cognitive psychological theory. What distinguishes it\nfrom analytic functionalism is that the information used in the\nfunctional characterization of mental states and processes\nneedn\u2019t be restricted to what is considered common knowledge or\ncommon sense, but can include information available only by careful\nempirical observation and experimentation. For example, a\npsychofunctional theory might be able to distinguish phenomena such as\ndepression from sadness or listlessness even though the distinctive\ncauses and effects of these syndromes are difficult to untangle solely\nby consulting intuitions or appealing to common sense. And\npsychofunctional theories will not include characterizations of mental\nstates for which there is no scientific evidence, such as\nbuyer\u2019s regret or hysteria, even if the existence and efficacy\nof such states is something that common sense affirms.\n\nThis may seem to be an unmitigated advantage, since psychofunctional\ntheories can avail themselves of all the tools of inquiry available to\nscientific psychology, and will presumably make all, and only, the\ndistinctions that are scientifically sound. This methodology, however,\nleaves psychofunctionalism open to the charge that it, like the\nPsycho-Physical Identity Thesis, may be overly\n\u201cchauvinistic\u201d (Block 1980b), since creatures whose\ninternal states share the rough, but not fine-grained, causal patterns\nof ours wouldn\u2019t count as sharing our mental states. Many\npsychofunctionalists, however, may not regard this as an unhappy\nconsequence, and argue that it\u2019s appropriate to treat only those\nwho are psychologically similar as having the same mental states.\n\nBut there is another serious worry about the thesis, namely, that if\nthe laws of the best empirical psychological theories diverge from\neven the broad contours of our \u201cfolk psychology\u201d \u2013\nthat is, our common sense beliefs about the causal roles of our\nthoughts, sensations, and perceptions \u2013 it will be hard to take\npsychofunctional theories as providing an account of our mental\nstates, rather than merely changing the subject (Loar 1981, Stich\n1983, Greenwood 1991, Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson 1996/2007). Many\ntheorists, however (Horgan and Woodward 1985), argue that it\u2019s\nlikely that future psychological theories will be recognizably close\nto \u201cfolk psychology\u201d, though this question has been the\nsubject of debate (Churchland 1981).\n\nYet another reason that some prefer analytic functionalism derives\nfrom a debate that occurred in the early days of the Psycho-Physical\nIdentity Theory, the thesis that each type of mental state can be\nidentified with some type of brain state or neural activity. For\nexample, early identity theorists (e.g. Smart 1959) argued that it\nmakes perfect sense (and may well be true) to identify pain\nwith C-fiber stimulation. The terms \u2018pain\u2019 and\n\u2018C-fiber stimulation\u2019, they acknowledged, do not have the\nsame meaning, but nonetheless they can denote the same state;\nthe fact that an identity statement is not a priori, they argued, does\nnot mean that it is not true. And just because I need not consult some\nsort of brain scanner when reporting that I\u2019m in pain\ndoesn\u2019t mean that the pain I report is not a neural state that a\nbrain scanner could (in principle) detect.\n\nAn important \u2013 and enduring \u2013 objection to this argument,\nhowever, was raised early on by Max Black (reported in Smart 1959).\nBlack argued, following Frege (1892), that the only way that terms\nwith different meanings can denote the same state is to express (or\nconnote) different properties, or \u201cmodes of presentation\u201d,\nof that state. But this implies, he argued, that if terms like\n\u2018pain\u2019, \u2018thought\u2019 and \u2018desire\u2019 are\nnot equivalent in meaning to any physicalistic descriptions, they can\ndenote physical states only by expressing irreducibly mental\nproperties of them. This argument has come to be known as the\n\u201cDistinct Property Argument\u201d, and was taken by its\nproponents to undermine a thorough-going materialistic theory of the\nmind. \n\nIn response, Smart (1959) and later, Armstrong (1968) countered that\nthere could be relational, \u201ctopic-neutral\u201d terms that are\nequivalent in meaning to terms such as \u2018pain\u2019,\n\u2018thought\u2019, and \u2018desire\u2019, and if so, then there\nare properties distinct from physical properties by virtue of which\nmental state terms can denote brain states, yet are not irreducibly\nmental. However, Smart\u2019s and Armstrong\u2019s suggestions were\nwidely regarded as inadequate. The appeal of meaning-preserving\nfunctional characterizations, therefore, derives from their promise to\nprovide more plausible topic-neutral equivalents of our mental state\nterms and concepts and thereby blunt the anti-materialistic force of\nthe Distinct Property Argument. (See Lewis 1966).\n\nStill, though many regard functional characterizations as an\nimprovement on the earlier attempts by Smart and Armstrong, there is a\ndispute about whether any relational characterizations of our mental\nstates, especially sensations, could fully preserve the meanings of\nour mental state terms. On the other hand, there is a dispute about\nhow seriously to take the Distinct Property objection. (See White 1986\nand 2007, for more recent versions of this objection, and Block 2007,\nand Levin, 2020, for a response; these questions will be addressed\nmore fully in Section 5.5.)\n\nThere is yet another distinction between kinds of functional theory\n\u2013 one that crosscuts the distinctions described so far \u2013\nthat is important to note. This is the distinction between what has\ncome to be known as \u201crole\u201d functionalism and\n\u201crealizer\u201d (or \u201cfiller\u201d) functionalism\n(McLaughlin 2006).\n3.5 Role-functionalism and Realizer-functionalism\n\nTo see the difference between role-functionalism and\nrealizer-functionalism, consider \u2013 once again \u2013 the\n(avowedly simplistic) example of a functional theory of pain\nintroduced in the first section.\n\nPain is the state that tends to be caused by bodily injury,\nto produce the belief that something is wrong with the body and the\ndesire to be out of that state, to produce anxiety, and, in the\nabsence of any stronger, conflicting desires, to cause wincing or\nmoaning. \n\nAs noted earlier, if in humans this functional role is played by\nC-fiber stimulation, then, according to this functionalist theory,\nhumans can be in pain simply by undergoing C-fiber stimulation. But\nthere is a further question to be answered, namely, what is the\nproperty of pain itself? Is it the higher-level relational property of\nbeing in some state or other that plays the \u201cpain role\u201din\nthe theory, or the C-fiber stimulation that actually plays this\nrole?\n\nRole functionalists identify pain with that higher-level relational\nproperty. Realizer functionalists, however, take a functional theory\nmerely to provide definite descriptions of whichever\nlower-level properties satisfy the functional\ncharacterizations. On these views (also called \u201cfunctional\nspecification\u201d theories), if the property that occupies the\ncausal role of pain in human beings is C-fiber stimulation, then pain\n(or at least pain-in-humans) would be C-fiber stimulation,\nrather than the higher-level property of having some lower-level state\nthat plays the relevant role. (This is not to suggest that there is a\ndifference in kind between higher-level \u201crole\u201d properties\nand the lower-level \u201crealizations\u201d of those roles, since\nit may be that, relative to even lower-level descriptions, those\nrealizations can be characterized as functional states themselves\n(Lycan 1987).\n\nSome of the earliest versions of analytic functionalism (Lewis 1966,\nArmstrong 1968 \u2013 but see Lewis 1980, for a modification) were\npresented as functional specification theories, as topic-neutral\n\u201ctranslations\u201d of mental state terms that could pave the\nway for a psycho-physical identity theory by defusing the Distinct\nProperty Argument (see section 3.3). However, if there are differences\nin the physical states that satisfy the functional definitions in\ndifferent (actual or hypothetical) creatures, such theories \u2013\nlike most versions of the identity theory \u2013 would violate a key\nmotivation for functionalism, namely, that creatures with states that\nplay the same role in the production of other mental states and\nbehavior possess, literally, the same mental states.\n\nIt may be that there are some important, more general, physical\nsimilarities between the neural states of seemingly disparate\ncreatures that satisfy a given functional characterization. (This\nissue will be discussed further in Section 6.) However, even if this\nis so, it is unlikely that these similarities hold of all the\ncreatures, including Martians and other hypothetical beings, who could\nshare our functional organization, and thus our theory of mental\nstates would remain, in Block\u2019s (1980) terms, overly\n\u201cchauvinistic\u201d. One could counter the charge of\nchauvinism, of course, by suggesting that all creatures with\nlower-level states that satisfy a given functional characterization\npossess a common (lower-level) disjunctive state or property.\nOr one could suggest that, even if all creatures possessing states\nthat occupy (for example) the pain role are not literally in the same\nmental state, they nonetheless share a closely related higher-level\nproperty (call it, following Lewis 1966 (note 6), \u201cthe attribute\nof having pain\u201d). But neither alternative, for many\nfunctionalists, goes far enough to preserve the basic functionalist\nintuition that functional commonality outweighs physical diversity in\ndetermining whether creatures can possess the same mental states. Thus\nmany functionalists \u2013 both analytic and empirical \u2013\nadvocate role functionalism, which, in addition to avoiding\nchauvinism, permits mental state terms to be rigid designators (Kripke\n1972), denoting the same items \u2013 those higher-level\n\u201crole\u201d properties \u2013 in all possible worlds.\n\nOn the other hand, some functionalists \u2013 here, too, both\nanalytic and empirical \u2013 consider realizer functionalism to be\nin a better position than role functionalism to explain the causal\nefficacy of the mental. If I stub my toe and wince, we believe that my\ntoe stubbing causes my pain, which in turn causes my wincing. But,\nsome have argued (Malcolm 1968; Kim 1989, 1998) that if pain is\nrealized in me by some neural event-type, then insofar as there are\npurely physical law-like generalizations linking events of that type\nwith wincings, one can give a complete causal explanation of my\nwincing by citing the occurrence of that neural event (and the\nproperties by virtue of which it figures in those laws). And thus it\nseems that the higher-level role properties of that event are causally\nirrelevant. This is known as the \u201ccausal exclusion\nproblem\u201d, which is claimed to arise not just for functional role\nproperties, but for dispositional properties in general (Prior,\nPargetter, and Jackson 1982) \u2013 and indeed for any sort of mental\nstates or properties not type-identical to those invoked in physical\nlaws. This problem will be discussed further in Section 5.2.\n4. Constructing Plausible Functional Theories\n\nSo far, the discussion of how to provide functional characterizations\nof individual mental states has been vague, and the examples avowedly\nsimplistic. Is it possible to do better, and, if so, which version of\nfunctionalism is likely to have the greatest success? These questions\nwill be the focus of this section, and separate treatment will be\ngiven to experiential (often called \u2018qualitative\u2019 or\n\u2018phenomenal\u2019) states, such as perceptual experiences and\nbodily sensations, which have a distinctive qualitative character or\n\u201cfeel\u201d, and intentional states, such as thoughts, beliefs,\nand desires, which purport to represent the world in various ways To\nbe sure, there is increasing consensus that experiential states have\nrepresentational contents and intentional states have qualitative\ncharacter and thus that these two groups may not be mutually exclusive\n(see Horgan and Tienson, 2002). Nonetheless I will discuss them\nseparately to focus on what all agree to be the distinctive features\nof each.\n4.1 Characterizing Experiential States\n\nThe common strategy in the most successful treatments of perceptual\nexperiences and bodily sensations (Shoemaker 1984a, Clark 1993;\nadumbrated in Sellars 1956) is to individuate experiences of various\ngeneral types (color experiences, experiences of sounds, feelings of\ntemperature) in part by appeal to their positions in the\n\u201cquality spaces\u201d associated with the relevant sense\nmodalities \u2013 that is, the (perhaps multidimensional) matrices\ndetermined by judgments about the relative similarities and\ndifferences among the experiences in question. So, for example, the\nexperience of a very reddish-orange could be (partially) characterized\nas the state produced by the viewing of a color swatch within some\nparticular range, which tends to produce the judgment or belief that\nthe state just experienced is more similar to the experience of red\nthan of orange. (Analogous characterizations, of course, will have to\nbe given of these other color experiences.) The judgments or beliefs\nin question will themselves be (partially) characterized in terms of\ntheir tendencies to produce sorting or categorization behavior of\ncertain specified kinds.\n\nThis strategy may seem fatal to analytic functionalism, which\nrestricts itself to the use of a priori (or platitudinous) information\nto distinguish among mental states, since it\u2019s not clear that\nthe information needed to distinguish among experiences such as color\nperceptions is available to commonsense. However, this problem may not\nbe as dire as it seems. For example, if sensations and perceptual\nexperiences are characterized in terms of their places in a\n\u201cquality space\u201d determined by a person\u2019s\npre-theoretical judgments of similarity and dissimilarity (and perhaps\nalso in terms of their tendencies to produce various emotional\neffects), then these characterizations may qualify as platitudinous,\neven though they would have to be elicited by a kind of\n\u201cSocratic questioning\u201d.\n\nThere are limits to this strategy, however (see Section 5.5.1 on the\n\u201cinverted spectrum\u201d problem), which seem to leave two\noptions for analytic functionalists: fight \u2013 that is, deny that\nit\u2019s coherent to suppose that there exist the distinctions that\nthe critics suggest, or switch \u2013 that is, embrace another\nversion of functionalism in which the characterizations of mental\nstates, though not platitudinous, can provide information rich enough\nto individuate the states in question. To switch, however, would be to\ngive up the benefits (if any) of a theory that offers\nmeaning-preserving translations of our mental state terms.\n\nThere has been significant skepticism, however, about whether\nany functionalist theory \u2013 analytic or empirical\n\u2013 can capture what seems to be the distinctive qualitative\ncharacter of experiential states such as color perceptions, pains, and\nother bodily sensations; these questions will be addressed in section\n5.5 below.\n4.2 Characterizing Intentional States\n\nOn the other hand, intentional states such as beliefs, thoughts, and\ndesires (sometimes called \u201cpropositional attitudes\u201d) have\noften been thought to be easier to characterize functionally than\nexperiential states such as pains and color experiences (but not\nalways: see Searle 1992, G. Strawson 1994, Horgan and Tienson 2002,\nKriegel 2003, Pitt 2008, and Mendelovici, 2018) who suggest that\nintentional states have qualitative character as well). We can begin\nby characterizing beliefs as (among other things) states produced in\ncertain ways by sense-perception or inference from other beliefs, and\ndesires as states with certain causal or counterfactual relations to\nthe system\u2019s goals and needs, and specify further how (according\nto the relevant commonsense or empirical theory) beliefs and desires\ntend to interact with one another, and other mental states, to produce\nbehavior.\n\nOnce again, this characterization is crude, and needs more detail.\nMoreover, there are some further questions about characterizing\nintentional states \u2013 particularly belief \u2013 that have\nemerged in recent discussions. Once is whether a subject should be\nregarded as believing that p if there is a mismatch between her\navowals that p and the characteristic behaviors associated with\nbelieving that p in standard circumstances: do avowals outweigh\nbehaviors, or vice versa \u2013 or are there pragmatic factors that\ndetermine what the answer should be in different contexts? (See\nGendler, 2008, and Schwitzgebel, 2010). Another question is whether\nthe states that interact with desires (and other mental states) to\nproduce behavior are best regarded as \u201cfull on\u201d or\n\u201coutright\u201d beliefs, or rather as representations of the\nworld for which individuals have varying degrees of confidence. (See\nStaffel, 2013, 2019, and the many contributions to Huber and\nSchmidt-Petri, 2009, and Ebert and Smith, 2012, for further\ndiscussion. Functionalism, at least arguably, can accommodate a number\nof different answers to these questions, but the project of\ncharacterizing beliefs may not be straightforward.\n\nIndependently of these questions, functionalists need to say more\n(outright or not) about what makes a state a particular belief\n(outright or not) or desire, for example, the belief \u2013 or desire\n\u2013 that it will snow tomorrow. Most functional theories describe\nsuch states as different relations (or \u201cattitudes\u201d) toward\nthe same state of affairs or proposition (and to describe the belief\nthat it will snow tomorrow and the belief that it will rain tomorrow\nas the same attitude toward different propositions). This permits\ndifferences and similarities in the contents of intentional states to\nbe construed as differences and similarities in the propositions to\nwhich these states are related. But what makes a mental state a\nrelation to, or attitude toward, some proposition P? And can these\nrelations be captured solely by appeal to the functional roles of the\nstates in question?\n\nThe development of conceptual role semantics may seem to provide an\nanswer to these questions: what it is for Julian to believe that P is\nfor Julian to be in a state that has causal and counterfactual\nrelations to other beliefs and desires that mirror certain\ninferential, evidential, and practical (action-directed) relations\namong propositions with those formal structures (Field 1980; Loar\n1981; Block 1986). This proposal raises a number of important\nquestions. One is whether states capable of entering into such\ninterrelations can (must?) be construed as being, or including\nelements of, a \u201clanguage of thought\u201d (Fodor 1975; Harman\n1973; Field 1980; Loar 1981). Another is whether idiosyncrasies in the\ninferential or practical proclivities of different individuals make\nfor differences in (or incommensurabilities between) their intentional\nstates. (This question springs from a more general worry about the\nholism of functional specification, which will be discussed\nmore generally in Section 5.1.)\n\nYet another challenge for functionalism are the widespread intuitions\nthat support \u201cexternalism\u201d, the thesis that what mental\nstates represent, or are about, cannot be characterized without appeal\nto certain features of the environments in which those individuals are\nembedded. Thus, if one individual\u2019s environment differs from\nanother\u2019s, they may count as having different intentional\nstates, even though they reason in the same ways, and have exactly the\nsame \u201ctake\u201d on those environments from their own points of\nview.\n\nThe \u201cTwin Earth\u201d scenarios introduced by Putnam (1975) are\noften invoked to support an externalist individuation of beliefs about\nnatural kinds such as water, gold, or tigers. Twin Earth, as Putnam\npresents it, is a (hypothetical) planet on which things look, taste,\nsmell, and feel exactly the way they do on Earth, but which have\ndifferent underlying microscopic structures; for example, the stuff\nthat fills the streams and comes out of the faucets, though it looks\nand tastes like water, has molecular structure XYZ rather than\nH2O. Many theorists find it intuitive to think that we\nthereby mean something different by our term\n\u2018water\u2019 than our Twin Earth counterparts mean by theirs,\nand thus that the beliefs we describe as beliefs about water are\ndifferent from those that our Twin Earth counterparts would describe\nin the same way. Similar conclusions, they contend, can be drawn for\nall cases of belief (and other intentional states) regarding natural\nkinds.\n\nThe same problem, moreover, appears to arise for other sorts of belief\nas well. Tyler Burge (1979) presents cases in which it seems intuitive\nthat a person, Oscar, and his functionally equivalent counterpart have\ndifferent beliefs about various syndromes (such as arthritis) and\nartifacts (such as sofas) because the usage of these terms by their\nlinguistic communities differ. For example, in Oscar\u2019s\ncommunity, the term \u2018arthritis\u2019 is used as we use it,\nwhereas in his counterpart\u2019s community \u2018arthritis\u2019\ndenotes inflammation of the joints and also various maladies of the\nthigh. Burge\u2019s contention is that even if Oscar and his\ncounterpart both complain about the \u2018arthritis\u2019 in their\nthighs and make exactly the same inferences involving\n\u2018arthritis\u2019, they mean different things by their terms and\nmust be regarded as having different beliefs. If these cases are\nconvincing, then there are differences among types of intentional\nstates that can only be captured by characterizations of these states\nthat make reference to the practices of an individual\u2019s\nlinguistic community. These, along with the Twin Earth cases, suggest\nthat if functionalist theories cannot make reference to an\nindividual\u2019s environment, then capturing the representational\ncontent of (at least some) intentional states is beyond the scope of\nfunctionalism. (See Searle, 1980, for related arguments against\n\u201ccomputational\u201d theories of intentional states.)\n\nOn the other hand, the externalist individuation of intentional states\nmay fail to capture some important psychological commonalities between\nourselves and our counterparts that are relevant to the explanation of\nbehavior. If my Twin Earth counterpart and I have both come in from a\nlong hike, declare that we\u2019re thirsty, say \u201cI want some\nwater\u201d and head to the kitchen, it seems that our behavior can\nbe explained by citing a common desire and belief. Some theorists,\ntherefore, have suggested that functional theories should attempt\nmerely to capture what has been called the \u201cnarrow\ncontent\u201d of beliefs and desires \u2013 that is, whichever\nrepresentational features individuals share with their various Twin\nEarth counterparts. There is no consensus, however, about just how\nfunctionalist theories should treat these \u201cnarrow\u201d\nrepresentational features (Block 1986; Loar 1987, Yli-Vakkuti and\nHawthorne, 2018), and some philosophers have expressed skepticism\nabout whether such features should be construed as representations at\nall (Fodor 1994; also see the entry on\n narrow mental content).\n Even if a generally acceptable account of narrow representational\ncontent can be developed, however, if the intuitions inspired by\n\u201cTwin Earth\u201d scenarios remain stable, then one must\nconclude that the full representational content of intentional states\ncannot be captured by \u201cnarrow\u201d functional\ncharacterizations alone (and this will be true as well for certain\nsorts of qualitative states, e.g. color experiences, if they too have\nrepresentational content).\n4.3 Characterizing the Inputs and Outputs of a System\n\nConsiderations about whether certain sorts of beliefs are to be\nexternally individuated raise the related question about how best to\ncharacterize the stimulations and behaviors that serve as inputs\nand outputs to a system. Should they be construed as events\ninvolving objects in a system\u2019s environment (such as fire\ntrucks, water and lemons), or rather as events in that system\u2019s\nsensory and motor systems? Theories of the first type are often called\n\u201clong-arm\u201d functional theories (Block 1990), since they\ncharacterize inputs and outputs \u2013 and consequently the states\nthey are produced by and produce \u2013 by reaching out into the\nworld. Adopting a \u201clong-arm\u201d theory would prevent our Twin\nEarth counterparts from sharing our beliefs and desires, and may thus\nhonor intuitions that support an externalist individuation of\nintentional states (though further questions may remain about what\nQuine has called the \u201cinscrutability of reference\u201d; see\nPutnam 1988).\n\nIf functional characterizations of intentional states are intended to\ncapture their \u201cnarrow contents\u201d, however, then the inputs\nand outputs of the system will have to be specified in a way that\npermits individuals in different environments to be in the same\nintentional state. On this view inputs and outputs may be better\ncharacterized as activity in specific sensory receptors and motor\nneurons. But this (\u201cshort-arm\u201d) option also restricts the\nrange of individuals that can share our beliefs and desires, since\ncreatures with different neural structures will be prevented from\nsharing our mental states, even if they share all our behavioral and\ninferential dispositions. (In addition, this option would not be open\nto analytic functionalist theories, since generalizations that link\nmental states to neurally specified inputs and outputs would not,\npresumably, have the status of platitudes.)\n\nPerhaps there is a way to specify sensory stimulations that abstracts\nfrom the specifics of human neural structure enough to include any\npossible creature that intuitively seems to share our mental states,\nbut is sufficiently concrete to rule out entities that are clearly not\ncognitive systems (such as the economy of Bolivia; see Block 1980b).\nIf there is no such formulation, however, then functionalists will\neither have to dispel intuitions to the effect that certain systems\ncan\u2019t have beliefs and desires, or concede that their theories\nmay be more \u201cchauvinistic\u201d than initially hoped.\n\nClearly, the issues here mirror the issues regarding the individuation\nof intentional states discussed in the previous section. More work is\nneeded to develop the \u201clong-arm\u201d and\n\u201cshort-arm\u201d alternatives, and to assess the merits and\ndeficiencies of both.\n5. Objections to Functionalism\n\nThe previous sections were by and large devoted to the presentation of\nthe different varieties of functionalism and the evaluation of their\nrelative strengths and weaknesses. There have been many objections to\nfunctionalism, however, that apply to all versions of the theory. Some\nof these have already been introduced in earlier discussions, but\nthey, and many others, will be addressed in more detail here.\n5.1 Functionalism and Holism\n\nOne difficulty for every version of the theory is that functional\ncharacterization is holistic. Functionalists hold that mental\nstates are to be characterized in terms of their roles in a\npsychological theory \u2013 be it common sense, scientific, or\nsomething in between \u2013 but all such theories incorporate\ninformation about a large number and variety of mental states. Thus if\npain is interdefined with certain highly articulated beliefs and\ndesires, then animals who don\u2019t have internal states that play\nthe roles of our articulated beliefs and desires can\u2019t share our\npains, and humans without the capacity to feel pain can\u2019t share\ncertain (or perhaps any) of our beliefs and desires. In addition,\ndifferences in the ways people reason, the ways their beliefs are\nfixed, or the ways their desires affect their beliefs \u2013 due\neither to cultural or individual idiosyncrasies \u2013 might make it\nimpossible for them to share the same mental states. These are\nregarded as serious worries for all versions of functionalism (see\nStich 1983, Putnam 1988).\n\nSome functionalists, however (e.g. Lewis, 1972; Shoemaker 1984c), have\nsuggested that if a creature has states that approximately\nrealize our functional theories, or realize some more specific\ndefining subset of the theory particularly relevant to the\nspecification of those states, then they can qualify as being mental\nstates of the same types as our own. The problem, of course, is to\nspecify more precisely what it is to be an approximate realization of\na theory, or what exactly a \u201cdefining\u201d subset of a theory\nis intended to include, and these are not easy questions. (They have\nparticular bite, moreover, for analytic functionalist\ntheories, since specifying what belongs inside and outside the\n\u201cdefining\u201d subset of a functional characterization raises\nthe question of what are the conceptually essential, and what the\nmerely collateral, features of a mental state, and thus raise serious\nquestions about the feasibility of (something like) an\nanalytic-synthetic distinction. (Quine 1953, Rey 1997)).\n5.2 Functionalism and Mental Causation\n\nAnother worry for functionalism is the \u201ccausal exclusion\nproblem\u201d, introduced in Section 3.4: the worry about whether\nrole functionalism can account for what we take to be the causal\nefficacy of our mental states (Malcolm 1968, Kim 1989, 1998). For\nexample, if pain is realized in me by some neural state-type, then\ninsofar as there are purely physical law-like generalizations linking\nstates of that type with pain behavior, one can give a complete causal\nexplanation of my behavior by citing the occurrence of that neural\nstate (and the properties by virtue of which it figures in those\nlaws). And thus, some have argued, the higher-level role properties of\nthat state \u2013 its being a pain \u2013 are causally\nirrelevant.\n\nThere have been a number of different responses to this problem. Some\n(e.g. Loewer 2002, 2007, Antony and Levine 1997, Burge 1997, Baker\n1997) suggest that it arises from an overly restrictive account of\ncausation, in which a cause must \u201cgenerate\u201d or\n\u201cproduce\u201d its effect, a view which would count the\nmacroscopic properties of other special sciences as causally\nirrelevant as well. Instead, some argue, causation should be regarded\nas a special sort of counterfactual dependence between states of\ncertain types (Loewer 2002, 2007, Fodor 1990, Block 1997), or as a\nspecial sort of regularity that holds between them (Melnyk 2003). If\nthis is correct, then functional role properties (along with the other\nmacroscopic properties of the special sciences) could count as\ncausally efficacious (but see Ney 2012 for dissent). However, the\nplausibility of these accounts of causation depends on their prospects\nfor distinguishing bona-fide causal relations from those that are\nclearly epiphenomenal, and some have expressed skepticism about\nwhether they can do the job, among them Crane 1995, Kim 2007, Jackson\n1995, Ludwig 1998, and McLaughlin 2006, 2015. (On the other hand, see\nLyons (2006) for an argument that if functional properties are\ncausally inefficacious, this can be viewed as a benefit of\nthe theory.)\n\nYet other philosophers argue that causation is best regarded as a\nrelation between types of events that must be invoked to provide\nsufficiently general explanations of behavior (Antony and Levine 1997,\nBurge 1997, Baker 1997). Though many who are moved by the exclusion\nproblem (e.g. Kim, Jackson) maintain that there is a difference\nbetween generalizations that are truly causal and those that\ncontribute in some other (merely epistemic) way to our understanding\nof the world, theorists who advocate this response to the problem\ncharge that this objection, once again, depends on a restrictive view\nof causation that would rule out too much.\n\nAnother problem with views like the ones sketched above, some argue\n(Kim 1989, 1998), is that mental and physical causes would thereby\noverdetermine their effects, since each would be causally\nsufficient for their production. And, though some theorists argue that\noverdetermination is widespread and unproblematic (see Loewer 2002,\nand also Shaffer, 2003, and Sider 2003, for a more general discussion\nof overdetermination), others contend that there is a special relation\nbetween role and realizer that provides an intuitive explanation of\nhow both can be causally efficacious without counting as\noverdetermining causes. For example, Yablo (1992), suggests that\nmental and physical properties stand in the relation of determinable\nand determinate (just as red stands to scarlet), and argues that our\nconviction that a cause should be commensurate with its\neffects permits us to take the determinable, rather than the\ndeterminate, property to count as causally efficacious in\npsychological explanation. Bennett (2003) suggests, alternatively,\nthat the realizer properties metaphysically necessitate the\nrole properties in a way that prevents them from satisfying the\nconditions for overdetermination. Yet another suggestion (Wilson,\n1999, 2011, and Shoemaker, 2001) is that the causal powers of mental\nproperties are included among (or are proper subsets of) the causal\npowers of the physical properties that realize them. (See also\nMacdonald and Macdonald 1995, Witmer, 2003, Yates, 2012, and Strevens,\n2012, for related views.)\n\nThere has been substantial recent work on the causal exclusion\nproblem, which, as noted earlier, arises for any non-reductive theory\nof mental states. (See the entry on\n mental causation,\n as well as Bennett 2007, and Funkhouser 2007, for further discussion\nand extensive bibliographies.) But it is worth discussing a related\nworry about causation that arises exclusively for role-functionalism\n(and other dispositional theories), namely, the problem of\n\u201cmetaphysically necessitated effects\u201d (Rupert 2006,\nBennett 2007). If pain is functionally defined (either by an\nanalytic or an empirical theory) as the state of being in\nsome lower-level state or other that, in certain circumstances causes\nwincing, then it seems that the generalization that pain causes\nwincing (in those circumstances) is at best uninformative, since the\nstate in question would not be pain if it didn\u2019t. And,\non the Humean view of causation as a contingent relation, the causal\nclaim would be false. Davidson (1980b) once responded to a similar\nargument by noting that even if a mental state M is defined\nin terms of its production of an action A, it can often be\nredescribed in other terms P such that \u2018P\ncaused A\u2019 is not a logical truth. But it\u2019s\nunclear whether any such redescriptions are available to role (vs.\nrealizer) functionalists.\n\nSome theorists (e.g. Antony and Levine 1997) have responded by\nsuggesting that, though mental states may be defined in terms of some\nof their effects, they have other effects that do not follow\nfrom those definitions which can figure into causal generalizations\nthat are contingent, informative, and true. For example, even if it\nfollows from a functional definition that pain causes wincing (and\nthus that the relation between pain and wincing cannot be truly\ncausal), psychologists may discover, say, that pain produces\nresilience (or submissive behavior) in human beings. One might worry,\nnonetheless, that functional definitions threaten to leave too many\ncommonly cited generalizations outside the realm of contingency, and\nthus causal explanation: surely, we may think, we want to affirm\nclaims such as \u201cpain causes wincing\u201d. Such claims could be\naffirmed, however, if (as seems likely) the most plausible functional\ntheories define sensations such as pain in terms of a small subset of\ntheir distinctive psychological, rather than behavioral,\neffects (see section 4.2).\n\nA different line of response to this worry (Shoemaker 1984d, 2001) is\nto deny the Humean account of causation altogether, and contend that\ncausal relations are themselves metaphysically necessary, but this\nremains a minority view. (See also Bird, 2002, and Latham, 2011, for\nfurther discussion.)\n5.3 Functionalism and Introspective Belief\n\nAnother important question concerns the beliefs that we have about our\nown \u201coccurrent\u201d (as opposed to dispositional) mental\nstates such as thoughts, sensations, and perceptions. We seem to have\nimmediately available, non-inferential beliefs about these states, and\nthe question is how this is to be explained if mental states are\nidentical with functional properties.\n\nThe answer depends on what one takes these introspective beliefs to\ninvolve. Broadly speaking, there are two dominant views of the matter\n(but see Peacocke 1999, Ch. 5 for further alternatives). One popular\naccount of introspection \u2013 the \u201cinner sense\u201d model\non which introspection is taken to be a kind of \u201cinternal\nscanning\u201d of the contents of one\u2019s mind (Armstrong 1968)\n\u2013 has been taken to be unfriendly to functionalism, on the\ngrounds that it\u2019s hard to see how the objects of such scanning\ncould be second-order relational properties of one\u2019s neural\nstates (Goldman 1993). Some theorists, however, have maintained that\nfunctionalism can accommodate the special features of introspective\nbelief on the \u201cinner sense\u201d model, since it would be only\none of many domains in which it\u2019s plausible to think that we\nhave immediate, non-inferential knowledge of causal or dispositional\nproperties (Armstrong 1993; Kobes 1993; Sterelney 1993). A full\ndiscussion of these questions goes beyond the scope of this entry, but\nthe articles cited above are just three among many helpful pieces in\nthe Open Peer Commentary following Goldman (1993), which provides a\ngood introduction to the debate about this issue.\n\nAnother account of introspection, identified most closely with\nShoemaker (1996a,b,c,d), is that the immediacy of introspective belief\nfollows from the fact that occurrent mental states and our\nintrospective beliefs about them are functionally interdefined. For\nexample, one satisfies the definition of being in pain only if one is\nin a state that tends to cause (in creatures with the requisite\nconcepts who are considering the question) the belief that one is in\npain, and one believes that one is in pain only if one is in a state\nthat plays the belief role, and is caused directly by the pain itself.\nOn this account of introspection, the immediacy and non-inferential\nnature of introspective belief is not merely compatible with\nfunctionalism, but required by it.\n\nBut there is an objection, most recently expressed by George Bealer\n(1997; see also Hill 1993), that, on this model an introspective\nbelief can only be defined in one of two unsatisfactory ways: either\nas a belief produced by a (second-order) functional state specified\n(in part) by its tendency to produce that very type of belief \u2013\nwhich would be circular \u2013 or as a belief about the first-order\nrealization of the functional state, rather than that state\nitself. Functionalists have suggested, however (Shoemaker 2001,\nMcCullagh 2000, Tooley 2001), that there is a way of understanding the\nconditions under which beliefs can be caused by, and thus be about,\none\u2019s second-order functional states that permits mental states\nand introspective beliefs about them to be non-circularly defined (but\nsee Bealer 2001, for a skeptical response). A full treatment of this\nobjection involves the more general question of whether second-order\nproperties can have causal efficacy, and is thus beyond the scope of\nthis discussion (see section 5.2 and the\n mental causation\n entry). But even if this objection can ultimately be deflected, it\nsuggests that special attention must be paid to the functional\ncharacterizations of \u201cself-directed\u201d mental states.\n5.4 Functionalism and the Norms of Reason\n\nYet another objection to functionalist theories of any sort is that\nthey do not capture the interrelations that we take to be definitive\nof beliefs, desires, and other intentional states. Whereas even\nanalytic functionalists hold that mental states \u2013 and also their\ncontents \u2013 are implicitly defined in terms of their (causal or\nprobabilistic) roles in producing behavior, these critics\nunderstand intentional states to be implicitly defined in terms of\ntheir roles in rationalizing, or making sense of,\nbehavior. This is a different enterprise, they claim, since\nrationalization, unlike causal explanation, requires showing how an\nindividual\u2019s beliefs, desires, and behavior conform, or at least\napproximate, to certain a priori norms or ideals of\ntheoretical and practical reasoning \u2013 prescriptions about which\nbeliefs and desires we should have, how we should\nreason, or what, given our beliefs and desires, we ought to\ndo. (See Davidson 1980c, Dennett 1978, and McDowell 1985 for classic\nexpressions of this view.) Thus the defining\n(\u201cconstitutive\u201d) normative or rational relations among\nintentional states expressed by these principles cannot be expected to\ncorrespond to causal and probabilistic relations among our internal\nstates, sensory stimulations and behavior, since they constitute a\nkind of explanation that has sources of evidence and standards for\ncorrectness that are different from those of empirical theories\n(Davidson 1980c). One can\u2019t, that is, extract facts from\nvalues.\n\nThus, although attributions of mental states can in some sense explain\nbehavior by permitting an observer to \u201cinterpret\u201d it as\nmaking sense, they should not be expected to denote entities that\nfigure in empirical generalizations, either common sense or\nscientific. (This is not to say, these theorists stress, that there\nare no causes, or empirical laws of, behavior. These, however, will be\nexpressible only in the vocabularies of the neurosciences, or other\nlower-level sciences, and not as relations among beliefs, desires and\nbehavior.)\n\nFunctionalists have replied to these worries in different ways. Many\njust deny the intuition behind the objection, and maintain that even\nthe strictest conceptual analyses of our intentional terms and\nconcepts purport to define them in terms of their bona-fide causal\nroles, and that any norms they reflect are explanatory rather than\nprescriptive. They argue, that is, that if these generalizations are\nidealizations, they are the sort of idealizations that occur in any\nscientific theory: just as Boyle\u2019s Law depicts the relations\nbetween the temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas under certain\nideal experimental conditions, our a priori theory of the mind\nconsists of descriptions of what normal humans would do under\n(physically specifiable) ideal conditions, not prescriptions as to\nwhat they should, or are rationally required, to\ndo.\n\nOther functionalists agree that we may advert to various norms of\ninference and action in attributing beliefs and desires to others, but\ndeny that there is any in principle incompatibility between normative\nand empirical explanations. They argue that if there are causal\nrelations among beliefs, desires, and behavior that even approximately\nmirror the norms of rationality, then the attributions of intentional\nstates can be empirically confirmed (Fodor 1990; Rey 1997). In\naddition, many who hold this view suggest that the principles of\nrationality that intentional states must meet are quite minimal, and\ncomprise at most a weak set of constraints on the contours of our\ntheory of mind, such as that people can\u2019t, in general, hold\n(obviously) contradictory beliefs, or act against their (sincerely\navowed) strongest desires (Loar 1981). Still others suggest that the\nintuition that we attribute beliefs and desires to others according to\nrational norms is based on a fundamental mistake; these states are\nattributed not on the basis of whether they rationalize the behavior\nin question, but whether those subjects can be seen as using\nprinciples of inference and action sufficiently like our own \u2013\nbe they rational, like Modus Ponens, or irrational, like the\nGambler\u2019s Fallacy or the now familiar instances of\n\u201cpredictable irrationality\u201d documented in Kahneman, 2011.\n(See Stich 1981, and Levin 1988, for discussion of this question, and\nfor a more general debate about the compatibility of normative and\npsychological principles, see Rey, 2007, and Wedgwood, 2007. See also\nGl\u00fcer and Wikforss, 2009, 2013, and for further discussion, the\nentry on the\n normativity of meaning and content.)\n\nNonetheless, although many functionalists argue that the\nconsiderations discussed above show that there is no in principle bar\nto a functionalist theory that has empirical force, these worries\nabout the normativity of intentional ascription continue to fuel\nskepticism about functionalism (and, for that matter, any scientific\ntheory of the mind that uses intentional notions).\n\nIn addition to these general worries about functionalism, there are\nparticular questions that arise for functional characterizations of\nexperiential or phenomenal states. These questions will be discussed\nin the following section.\n5.5 Functionalism and the Problem of Qualia\n\nFunctionalist theories of all varieties \u2013 whether analytic or\nempirical, role or realizer \u2013 attempt to characterize mental\nstates exclusively in relational, specifically causal, terms. A common\nand persistent objection, however, is that no such characterizations\ncan capture the phenomenal character, or \u201cqualia\u201d, of\nexperiential states such as perceptions, emotions, and bodily\nsensations, since they would leave out certain essential properties of\nthose experiential states, namely, \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d\n(Nagel 1974) to have them. The next three sections will present the\nmost serious worries about the ability of functionalist theories to\ngive an adequate characterization of these states. (These worries, of\ncourse, will extend to intentional states, if, as some philosophers\nargue, \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d to have them is among their\nessential properties as well. (See Searle 1992, G. Strawson, 1986,\nHorgan and Tienson, 2002, Kriegel 2003, Pitt 2008, Mendelovici, 2018,\nfor presentations of this view, and see Bayne and Montague, 2011, and\nSmithies, 2013a and 2013b for more general discussions of whether\nintentional states possess phenomenal character \u2013 often called\n\u201ccognitive phenomenology\u201d \u2013 and if so, what, more\nprecisely, it is.)\n5.5.1 Inverted and Absent Qualia\n\nThe first to be considered are the \u201cabsent\u201d and\n\u201cinverted\u201d qualia objections most closely associated with\nNed Block (1980b; see also Block and Fodor 1972). The \u201cinverted\nqualia\u201d objection to functionalism maintains that there could be\nan individual who (for example) is in a state that satisfies the\nfunctional definition of our experience of red, but is experiencing\ngreen instead \u2013 and similarly for all the colors in the\nspectrum. It is a descendant of the claim, discussed by philosophers\nfrom Locke to Wittgenstein, that there could be an individual with an\n\u201cinverted spectrum\u201d who is behaviorally indistinguishable\nfrom someone with normal color vision; both objections trade on the\ncontention that the purely relational characterizations in question\ncannot make distinctions among distinct experiences with isomorphic\ncausal patterns. (Nida-R\u00fcmelin, 1996, argues that the science of\ncolor vision leaves open the possibility that there could be\nfunctionally equivalent red-green \u201cinverts\u201d, but even if\ninverted qualia are not really an empirical possibility for human\nbeings, given certain asymmetries in our \u201cquality space\u201d\nfor color, and differences in the relations of color experiences to\nother mental states such as emotions (Hardin 1988), it seems possible\nthat there are creatures with perfectly symmetrical color quality\nspaces for whom a purely functional characterization of color\nexperience would fail.)\n\nA related objection, the \u201cabsent qualia\u201d objection,\nmaintains that there could be creatures functionally equivalent to\nnormal humans whose mental states have no qualitative character at\nall. In his well-known \u201cChinese nation\u201d\nthought-experiment, Block (1980b) invites us to imagine that the\npopulation of China (chosen because its size approximates the number\nof neurons in a typical human brain) is recruited to duplicate his\nfunctional organization for a period of time, receiving the equivalent\nof sensory input from an artificial body and passing messages back and\nforth via satellite. Block argues that such a\n\u201chomunculi-headed\u201d system would not have mental states\nwith any qualitative character (other than the qualia possessed by the\nindividuals themselves), and thus that there could be states\nfunctionally equivalent to sensations or perceptions that lack their\ncharacteristic \u201cfeels\u201d. Conversely, some argue that\nfunctional role is not necessary for qualitative character:\nfor example, it seems that one could have mild, but distinctive,\ntwinges that have no typical causes or characteristic effects.\n\nAll these objections purport to have characterized a creature with the\nfunctional organization of normal human beings, but without any, or\nthe right sort, of qualia (or vice versa), and thus to have produced a\ncounterexample to functional theories of experiential states. One line\nof response, initially advanced by Sydney Shoemaker (1994b), is that\nalthough functional duplicates of ourselves with inverted qualia may\nbe possible, duplicates with absent qualia are not, since their\npossibility leads to untenable skepticism about the qualitative\ncharacter of one\u2019s own mental states. This argument has been\nchallenged, however (Block 1980b; but see Shoemaker\u2019s response\nin 1994d, and Balog, 1999, for a related view), and the more common\nresponse to these objections \u2013 particularly to the absent qualia\nobjection \u2013 is to question whether scenarios involving creatures\nsuch as Block\u2019s Chinese nation provide genuine counterexamples\nto functionalist theories of experiential states.\n\nFor example, some theorists (Dennett 1978; Levin 1985; Van Gulick\n1989) argue that these scenarios provide clear-cut counterexamples\nonly to crude functional theories, and that attention to the\nsubtleties of more sophisticated characterizations will undermine the\nintuition that functional duplicates of ourselves with absent qualia\nare possible (or, conversely, that there are qualitative states\nwithout distinctive functional roles). The plausibility of this line\nof defense is often questioned, however, since there is tension\nbetween the goal of increasing the sophistication (and thus the\nindividuative powers) of the functional definitions, and the goal (for\nanalytic functionalists) of keeping these definitions within the\nbounds of the platitudinous (though see Section 4.2), or (for\npsychofunctionalists) broad enough to be instantiable by creatures\nother than human beings. A related suggestion is that absent qualia\nseem possible only because of our imaginative shortcomings, in\nparticular, that it is hard for us to attend, at any one time, to all\nthe relevant features of even the simplest functional characterization\nof experiential states; another is that the intuition that these\ncreatures lack qualia is based on prejudice \u2013 against creatures\nwith unfamiliar shapes and extended reaction times (Dennett 1978), or\ncreatures with parts widely distributed in space (Lycan, 1981,\nSchwitzgebel 2015 and commentary).\n\nThere are other responses to analogous absent qualia arguments that\nare prominent in the literature, but the target of those arguments is\nbroader. Block\u2019s argument was initially presented as a challenge\nexclusively to functionalist theories, both analytic and empirical,\nand not generally to physicalistic theories of experiential states;\nthe main concern was that the purely relational resources of\nfunctional description were incapable of capturing the intrinsic\nqualitative character of states such as feeling pain, or seeing red.\n(Indeed, in Block\u2019s 1980b, p. 291, he suggests that qualitative\nstates may best be construed as \u201ccomposite state[s] whose\ncomponents are a quale and a [functional state],\u201d and\nadds, in an endnote (note 22) that the quale \u201cmight be\nidentified with a physico-chemical state\u201d.) But there are\nsimilar objections that have been raised against all physicalistic\ntheories of experiential states that are important to consider in\nevaluating the prospects for functionalism. These will be discussed in\nthe next two sections.\n5.5.2 Functionalism, Zombies, and the \u201cExplanatory Gap\u201d\n\nOne important objection, advanced by (among others) Kripke (1972) and\nChalmers (1996a), derives from Descartes\u2019s well-known argument\nin the Sixth Meditation (1641) that since he can clearly and\ndistinctly conceive of himself existing apart from his body (and vice\nversa), and since the ability to clearly and distinctly conceive of\nthings as existing apart guarantees that they are in fact distinct, he\nis in fact distinct from his body.\n\nChalmers\u2019s version of the argument (1996a, 2002), known as the\n\u201cZombie Argument\u201d, has been particularly influential. The\nfirst premise of this argument is that it is conceivable, in\na special, robust, \u201cpositive\u201d sense, that there are\nmolecule-for-molecule duplicates of oneself with no qualia (call them\n\u201czombies\u201d, following Chalmers 1996a). The second premise\nis that scenarios that are \u201cpositively\u201d conceivable in\nthis way represent real, metaphysical, possibilities. Thus, he\nconcludes, zombies are possible, and functionalism \u2013 or, more\nbroadly, physicalism \u2013 is false. The force of the Zombie\nArgument is due in large part to the way Chalmers defends its two\npremises; he provides a detailed account of just what is required for\nzombies to be conceivable, and also an argument as to why the\nconceivability of zombies entails their possibility (see also Chalmers\n2002, 2006, 2010, Ch. 6, and Chalmers and Jackson 2002). This account,\nbased on a more comprehensive theory of how we can evaluate claims\nabout possibility and necessity known as \u201ctwo-dimensional\nsemantics\u201d, reflects an increasingly popular way of thinking\nabout these matters, but remains controversial. (For alternative ways\nof explaining conceivability, see Kripke (1986), Hart (1988); for\ncriticism of the argument from two-dimensional semantics, see Yablo\n2000, 2002, Bealer 2002, Stalnaker 2002, Soames 2004, Byrne and Prior\n2006; but see also Chalmers 2006.)\n\nIn a related challenge, Joseph Levine (1983, 1993, 2001) argues that,\neven if the conceivability of zombies doesn\u2019t entail that\nfunctionalism (or more broadly, physicalism) is false, it opens an\n\u201cexplanatory gap\u201d not encountered in other cases of\ninter-theoretical reduction, since the qualitative character of an\nexperience cannot be deduced from any physical or functional\ndescription of it. Such attempts thus pose, at very least, a unique\nepistemological problem for functionalist (or physicalist) reductions\nof qualitative states.\n\nIn response to these objections, analytic functionalists contend, as\nthey did with the inverted and absent qualia objections, that\nsufficient attention to what is required for a creature to duplicate\nour functional organization would reveal that zombies are not really\nconceivable, and thus there is no threat to functionalism and no\nexplanatory gap. A related suggestion is that, while zombies may\nnow seem conceivable, we will eventually find them\ninconceivable, given the growth of empirical knowledge, just as we now\nfind it inconceivable that there could be H2O without water\n(Yablo 1999). Alternatively, some suggest that the inconceivability of\nzombies awaits the development of new concepts that can\nprovide a link between our current phenomenal and physical concepts\n(Nagel 1975, 2000), while others (McGinn 1989) agree, but deny that\nhumans are capable of forming such concepts.\n\nNone of these responses, however, would be an effective defense of\nPsychofunctionalism, which does not attempt to provide analyses of\nexperiential concepts (or suggest that there would, or could, be any\nto come). But there is an increasingly popular strategy for defending\nphysicalism against these objections that could be used to defend\nPsychofunctionalism, namely, to concede that there can be no\nconceptual analyses of qualitative concepts (such as what\nit\u2019s like to see red or what it\u2019s like to feel\npain) in purely functional terms, and focus instead on developing\narguments to show that the conceivability of zombies neither implies\nthat such creatures are possible nor opens up an explanatory gap.\n\nOne line of argument (Block and Stalnaker 1999; Yablo 2000) contends\nthat the conceivability of (alleged) counterexamples to\npsycho-physical or psycho-functional identity statements, such as\nzombies, has analogues in other cases of successful inter-theoretical\nreduction, in which the lack of conceptual analyses of the terms to be\nreduced makes it conceivable, though not possible, that the identities\nare false. However, the argument continues, if these cases routinely\noccur in what are generally regarded as successful reductions in the\nsciences, then it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the\nconceivability of a situation does not entail its possibility.\n\nA different line of argument (Horgan 1984; Loar 1990; Lycan 1990; Hill\n1997, Hill and McLaughlin 1999, Balog 1999, Levin 2018) maintains\nthat, while generally the conceivability of a scenario entails its\npossibility, scenarios involving zombies stand as important\nexceptions. The difference is that the phenomenal, or \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d, concepts used to describe the properties of\nexperience that we conceive zombies to lack are significantly\ndifferent from the third-personal, discursive concepts of our common\nsense and scientific theories such as mass, force or\ncharge; they comprise a special class of non-discursive,\nfirst-personal, perspectival representations of those properties.\nWhereas conceptually independent third-personal concepts x\nand y may reasonably be taken to express metaphysically\nindependent properties, or modes of presentation, no such metaphysical\nconclusions can be drawn when one of the concepts in question is\nthird-personal and the other is phenomenal, since these\nconcepts may merely be picking out the same properties in different\nways. Thus, the conceivability of zombies, dependent as it is on our\nuse of phenomenal concepts, provides no evidence of their metaphysical\npossibility.\n\nKey to this line of defense is the claim that these special phenomenal\nconcepts can denote functional (or physical) properties without\nexpressing some irreducibly qualitative modes of presentation of them,\nfor otherwise it couldn\u2019t be held that these concepts do in fact\napply to our functional (or physical) duplicates, even though\nit\u2019s conceivable that they don\u2019t. This, not surprisingly,\nhas been disputed, and there is currently much discussion in the\nliterature about the plausibility of this claim. If this line of\ndefense is successful, however, it can also provide a response to the\n\u201cDistinct Property Argument\u201d, discussed in section 3.3.\n(See Chalmers 1999, Holman 2013 for criticism of this view, but see\nthe responses of Loar 1999, Hill & McLaughlin 1999, Balog 2012,\nLevin 2008, 2018, Diaz-Leon, 2010, 2014; see also see Levin 2002,\n2008, and Schroer 2010, for the presentation, if not endorsement, of a\nhybrid view.)\n5.5.3 Functionalism and the Knowledge Argument\n\nIn another important, related, challenge to functionalism (and, more\ngenerally, physicalism), Thomas Nagel (1974) and Frank Jackson (1982)\nargue that a person could know all the physical and functional facts\nabout a certain type of experience and still not \u201cknow what\nit\u2019s like\u201d to have it. This is known as the\n\u201cKnowledge Argument\u201d, and its conclusion is that there are\ncertain properties of experiences \u2013 the \u201cwhat it\u2019s\nlike\u201d to see red, feel pain, or sense the world through\necholocation \u2013 which cannot be identified with functional (or\nphysical) properties. Though neither Nagel (2000) nor Jackson (1998)\nnow endorse this argument, many philosophers contend that it raises\nspecial problems for any physicalistic view (see Alter 2007, and, in\nresponse, Jackson 2007).\n\nAn early line of defense against these arguments, endorsed primarily\nbut not exclusively by a priori functionalists, is known as the\n\u201cAbility Hypothesis\u201d. (Nemirow 1990, 2007, Lewis 1990,\nLevin 1986). \u201cAbility\u201d theorists suggest that knowing what\nit\u2019s like to see red or feel pain is merely a sort of\npractical knowledge, a \u201cknowing how\u201d (to imagine,\nremember, or re-identify, a certain type of experience) rather than a\nknowledge of propositions or facts. (See Tye 2000, for a summary of\nthe pros and cons of this position; for further discussion, see the\nessays in Ludlow, Nagasawa, and Stoljar 2004.) An alternative view\namong contemporary functionalists is that coming to know what\nit\u2019s like to see red or feel pain is indeed to acquire\npropositional knowledge uniquely afforded by experience, expressed in\nterms of first-personal concepts of those experiences. But, the\nargument continues, this provides no problem for functionalism (or\nphysicalism), since these special first-personal concepts need not\ndenote, or introduce as \u201cmodes of presentation\u201d, any\nirreducibly qualitative properties. This view, of course, shares the\nstrengths and weaknesses of the analogous response to the\nconceivability arguments discussed above. If it is plausible, however,\nit can also challenge the argument of some philosophers (e.g.,\nChalmers, 2002, Stoljar, 2001, and Alter, 2016) that maintains that no\nphysicalistic theory, not even fundamental physics, can provide\nanything but a relational characterization of the items in their\ndomains \u2013 their structure and dynamics \u2013 and concludes\nthat no physicalistic theory can capture what seems, from the inside,\nto be the intrinsic, non-relational properties of our experiential\nstates. (See the essays in Alter and Nagasawa, 2015, Part III, for\nfurther discussion.)\n\nThere is one final strategy for defending a functionalist account of\nqualitative states against all of these objections, namely,\neliminativism (Dennett 1988; Rey 1997, Pereboom 2011, Frankish 2016).\nOne can, that is, deny that there are any such things as irreducible\nqualia, and maintain that the conviction that such things do,\nor perhaps even could, exist is due to illusion \u2013 or\nconfusion.\n6. The Future of Functionalism\n\nIn the last part of the 20th century, functionalism stood as the\ndominant theory of mental states. Like behaviorism, functionalism\ntakes mental states out of the realm of the \u201cprivate\u201d or\nsubjective, and gives them status as entities open to scientific\ninvestigation. But, in contrast to behaviorism, functionalism\u2019s\ncharacterization of mental states in terms of their roles in the\nproduction of behavior grants them the causal efficacy that common\nsense takes them to have. Moreover, functionalism, in contrast to the\npsychophysical identity thesis, seems to offer an account of mental\nstates that is friendly to materialism without limiting the class of\nthose with minds to creatures with brains like ours.\n\nMore recently, however, there has been a resurgence of interest in the\npsycho-physical (type-) identity thesis. This is fueled in part by the\nobservation that in the actual practice of neuroscience, neural states\nare type-individuated more coarsely than early identity theorists such\nas Place, Feigl, and Smart assumed, and the contention that, contrary\nto the claims of early defenders of functionalism (e.g. Putnam), there\nare relatively few extant creatures that are physically unlike humans\nbut share our functional organization. If this is so, then it may well\nbe that many of our genuine functional equivalents that differ from us\nin their fine-grained neurophysiological make-up can nonetheless share\nour neural, as well as mental, states, and thus that the\npsycho-physical identity thesis can claim some of the scope once\nthought to be exclusive to functionalism. (See Bechtel 2012, Bickle\n2012, McCauley 2012, Shapiro & Polger 2012, and Polger &\nShapiro 2016.)\n\nThe plausibility of this thesis, of course, depends on whether or not\nthese underlying similarities would in fact be (coarse grained)\nneural similarities, and not (fine-grained) psycho-functional\nsimilarities. In addition, functionalists can argue that there are\npossible creatures, both biological and (especially)\nnon-biological, that are functionally equivalent to us but do not\npossess even our coarse-grained neural properties. If so, and if these\ncreatures can plausibly be regarded as sharing our mental states\n\u2013 to be sure, a controversial thesis \u2013 then even if neural\nstates can be individuated more coarsely, some variety of\nfunctionalism will retain its claim to greater universality than the\nidentity thesis.\n\nAnother source of skepticism about the relative universality of\nfunctionalist (versus type-identity) theories derives from the\nsuggestion that \u2013 at least in humans \u2013 the properties that\ncould play the relevant roles in our functional architecture are not\nexclusively electrical impulses of our neurons, but a combination of\nthese impulses plus other features of the brain and body,\nincluding the endocrine system. (See Cao 2022 and Damasio 1999.) If\nthis is so, then there may be fewer extant examples of creatures that\nare functional, but not physical, duplicates of humans, and it may be\nless likely that such creatures are even nomologically possible. They\nmay, of course, be metaphysically possible, existing in fairly distant\npossible worlds, but there is debate about whether this is plausible,\nand if so, whether it would seriously undermine the psycho-physical\nidentity theory.\n\nOn the other hand, some critics of the psycho-physical identity theory\ncontend that only a theory that characterizes mental states as\nhigher-order properties, with causal powers not possessed by the\nstates or properties that realize them, can preserve the explanatory\nhierarchy modeled on the relations between biology and chemistry, and\nchemistry and physics. The identification of mental states with\nfunctional roles would do the trick, whether or not our mental states\nare in fact multiply realized. (See Gillett 2002, Aizawa and Gillett\n2007, 2009, and the essays in DeJoong and Shouten 2007 for further\ndiscussion; see also the entry on\n multiple realizability.)\n These questions remain the subject of active debate.\n\nYet another question is whether Role Functionalism, by itself, is as\nfriendly to materialism as its initial advocates had suggested \u2013\neven if the functional roles to be identified with mental states are\nrealized exclusively by physical states. It is generally agreed that\nthe mere supervenience of the mental on the physical \u2013 that is,\nthe impossibility of there being a mental difference without some\nphysical difference \u2013 leaves open the possibility that mental\nproperties are emergent properties with additional causal powers,\nwhereas the realization of mental states by physical states eliminates\nthis possibility. However, some say, while others deny, that\nmaterialism requires something more, namely, an explanation of how (or\nwhy) those physical properties can occupy the relevant functional\nroles. This too is a contentious question. (See, for further\ndiscussion, Endicott 2016 and Shaffer 2021).\n\nThere remain other substantive questions about functionalism. One is\nwhether it can provide an adequate account of all mental states. Most\ndiscussions of the prospects for functionalism focus on its adequacy\nas an account of familiar experiential states such as sensational and\nperceptual experiences, and familiar intentional states such as\nbeliefs and desires. But what about emotions \u2013 and moods?\nAlthough there is some discussion of these states in the functionalism\nliterature, (e.g. Rey 1990, Nussbaum 2003, deHooge, et al. 2011)\nthere is increasing interest in these questions, and more work needs\nto be done. In addition, there is increasing interest in determining\nwhether there can be plausible functional characterizations of\nnon-standard perceptual experiences, such as synesthesia, and various\nsorts of altered states of consciousness that can arise from the\ningestion of drugs, natural hallucinogenic substances, or focused\nmeditation. (See Gray et al. 2002, 2004, and Deroy 2017, for\ndiscussions of synesthesia. For general discussions of altered states\nof consciousness, see Velmans and Schneider (eds.) 2007, and\nThompson 2015.)\n\nAnother question is whether functional theories can accommodate\nnon-standard views about the location of mental states, such as the\nhypothesis of extended cognition, which maintains that certain mental\nstates such as memories \u2013 and not just their representational\ncontents \u2013 can reside outside the head. This question has\nimplications not only for the viability of a functionalist\ncharacterization of memory, but also of beliefs, emotions,\nhallucinations, and moods. (See Clark and Chalmers 2002, Clark, 2008,\nAdams and Aizawa 2008, Rupert 2009, Sprevack 2009, Byrne and Manzotti\n2022, and the essays in Menary 2010, for further discussion.)\n\nYet another question of increasing interest to philosophers is whether\ngroups of individuals, or entire communities, can possess mental\nstates (e.g. beliefs, desires, intentions, moods, and emotions) that\ncannot be reduced to the mental states of the individuals in those\ncommunities. (See Gilbert 2013.) Is it merely metaphorical to say\nthat a community (and not just the individuals in it) is optimistic,\nor conservative, or believes that human activities cause climate\nchange, or remembers the 60s? Or can claims like this be literally\ntrue \u2013 and if so, how; does it matter how many members of the\ncommunity in question individually possess the belief, intention, or\nemotion in question? It is easy to see, moreover, that answers to\nthese questions would have implications not only for theories of the\nnature of mental states, but also for theories of self-knowledge and\nknowledge of other minds. They would also have implications for\ntheories of moral evaluation: Desires and intentions lead to actions,\nand if a community intends to help resettle new immigrants or block\naccess to a public beach, then whom (or what) can we legitimately\npraise and blame for these actions, and to whom (or what) do we have\nmoral obligations?\n\nIn general, the sophistication of functionalist theories has increased\nsince their introduction, but so has the sophistication of the\nobjections to functionalism, especially to functionalist accounts of\nmental causation \n (section 5.2), \n introspective knowledge \n (Section 5.3),\n and the qualitative character of experiential states \n (Section 5.5).\nFor those unconvinced of the plausibility of dualism, however, and\nunwilling to restrict mental states to creatures physically like\nourselves, the initial attractions of functionalism remain. The\nprimary challenge for future functionalists, therefore, will be to\nmeet these objections to the doctrine, either by articulating a\nfunctionalist theory in increasingly convincing detail, or by showing\nhow the intuitions that fuel these objections can be explained\naway.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, F. and K.
