    "main_text": "Constructivism || Hard Constructivism Against Essentialism\n7.3 Hard Constructivism Against Essentialism\n\nHard constructivism\u2019s main argument against essentialism and\nPCEs is as follows (Katz 1978):\n\n\nPremise A: The conceptual scheme a mystic possesses completely\ndetermines the nature and content of the mystical experience.\n\nPremise B: Mystics from different mystical traditions possess\npervasively different conceptual schemes.\n\nConclusion: Therefore, there cannot be a common experience across\ncultural traditions. That is, essentialism is false.\n\n\nRegarding Premise B, Katz (2013) has edited a massive volume on\nmysticism with the aim of displaying the stark differences between\nmystical experiences of different traditions, due to linguistic,\ncultural, religious, and sociological factors.\n\nSo too, theistic experiences are theory-laden and even their\ninterpretation as theistic is the result of being embedded in a\npropensity to think theistically. That is why, allegedly, such\nexperiences are rarely reported by those not already theists or in\ntheistic communities. Such experiences, then, are \u201cpolluted\u201d by\ntheory (Oppy 2006, 350).\n",
