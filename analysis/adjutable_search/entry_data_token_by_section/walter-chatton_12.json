    "main_text": "Indivisibilism || How Aristotle Attacked Indivisibles\n5.5 How Aristotle Attacked Indivisibles\n\nAristotle\u2019s most famous arguments against the composition of\ncontinua out of indivisibles are in Physics, VI.1. His\ndiscussion is a bit disjointed. It can be difficult to untangle and\narrange the pieces for interpretation, or even to know how and when to\ndistinguish different arguments in the text. Chatton focuses on two\narguments in Chapter 1, the most famous of which is known as the\ntouching argument (Physics, VII.1, 231a21\u2013231b10)\nI present the reasoning of this argument as I think Chatton understood\nit below.\n\nThe main conclusion of the touching argument is this:\n\n\nThere can be no discrete indivisible entities composing a continuous\nextended magnitude.\n\n\nThe argument is by cases, and it tries to show that these three\nconcept-clusters\ndiscrete/indivisible\n/ composing a continuous extended magnitude\n\nare completely incompatible.\n\nUpon assuming for reductio that discrete indivisibles could\ncompose an extended continuum, there are four scenarios Aristotle\nthinks we must consider. To generate them, pick any two such alleged\nindivisibles composing a continuum. Then these indivisibles either (1)\ntouch a third indivisible or (2) do not touch a third indivisible.\nSuppose they do touch a third indivisible. Two subcases appear: they\ntouch it either (1a) both in the same spot, or (1b) each in different\nspots. On the other hand, if they do not touch a third indivisible it\nis for one of two reasons: either (2a) they have gaps in between them,\nor (2b) their extremities are one.\n\nThe touching argument is supposed to show that the assumptions of each\nsubcase pull apart the above concepts at some junction or other. In\narguing through each of the subcases we will boldface\nthe concepts which are being pulled apart or dislodged, and\nunderline the lever being used to do it. The destabilization\nalways comes at the expense of one of the concepts, as we will\ncarefully note.\n\nFor case (1), the lever that pries the concept cluster apart is the\nconcept of touching. Take supposed discrete indivisibles\nA and B, then consider discrete indivisible\nC. (It is easiest if we start by trying to imagine C\nin between them.) That they are all able to touch is presupposed by\nthe fact that they are all discrete. Since it is possible, let us\nassume it is actually the case that A and B touch\nC, and consider the two subcases.\n\n(1a) If they touch C in the same spot, then since C\nis indivisible, A and B must coincide, and hence\ncannot compose an extended magnitude, presumably because if two\ndiscrete indivisibles add nothing to the extension of the\nmagnitude then no amount of them can produce any extension at\nall. In this subcase the fact that they are discrete ensures the\npossibility of touching, but the\nindivisibility of C and its being touched\nin the same spot undermine the claim that they compose a\ncontinuous extended magnitude. The conflict is with the\nextended bit. Allowing \u201c\u21d4\u201d to symbolize\nindivisibles touching and \u201c=\u201d indivisibles coinciding, we\ncould picture the problem like this:\n\nA=B\u21d4C; therefore, A and\nB do not compose an extended magnitude\n\n(1b) If they touch C in different spots, then A and\nB can remain discrete, but we must conclude C has\nmore than one spot on it, hence is not indivisible. Here discrete\nensures the possibility of touching, but touching in\ndifferent spots makes discrete and\nindivisible come apart. We can picture the situation\nlike this:\n\nA\u21d4C\u21d4B; therefore, C is\nnot indivisible\n\n\nBy the law of excluded middle and dilemma, discrete\neither makes indivisible and composing a\ncontinuous extended magnitude inconsistent, or else makes\nitself inconsistent with\nindivisible, assuming that indivisibles touch.\nThe concept cluster is thus completely inconsistent under the\nassumption of touching.\n\nWhat happens when we assume they do not touch? There are two\npossibilities and so two non-touching cases to reason through: (2a)\nthey do not touch because they are separated, or (2b) they do\nnot touch because they have their extrema in\ncommon. Under either assumption we can again undermine at least\none element of the concept cluster.\n\nIf (2a) holds, then since they are separated, they can no\nlonger be seen as composing a continuous extended\nmagnitude. We can picture it like this:\n\nA   C   B; therefore,\nthey are not continuous\n\n\nThe problem now is obviously with the continuous bit\nof that complex concept; the magnitude they would compose is now\n\u2018gappy\u2019.\n\nIf (2b) holds then since A, B, and C have\ntheir extrema in common, they are really one, in which\ncase A, B, and C are no longer\ndiscrete. The situation can be pictured like this (we\ncan no longer really use distinct symbols to illustrate):\n\nABC; therefore, they are not discrete\n\n\nAristotle assumes from previous discussion that there are exactly\nthree ways things can be in a spatial or temporal order, as he puts\nit, can be in succession: two successive items either have\ntheir extremities as one (continuous; e.g., two halves of a\nline) or have their extremities together (contiguous; e.g., a\nbronze sphere immersed in water) or have their extremities such that\nnothing of the same kind intervenes between (merely in\nsuccession; e.g., two houses). Case (1) above shows what would\nhappen if two discrete indivisibles\u2019 extremities were not one but\nstill touched, that is, if they were contiguous but not continuous;\ncase (2a) shows what would happen if they were merely in succession,\nand case (2b) shows what would happen if their boundaries were one,\nthat is, if they were continuous. Hence Aristotle seems to feel he has\ncaptured all relevant cases here.\n\nLet us summarize the incompatibilities. Assuming there could be\ndiscrete indivisibles composing a continuous extended magnitude:\n\n\n(1a) their touching as a whole makes extended\nuntenable;\n\n(1b) their touching by parts makes indivisible\nuntenable;\n\n(2a) their being separated makes continuous\nuntenable;\n\n(2b) their having extremities as one makes\ndiscrete untenable.\n\n\nHence, we may conclude it is impossible that discrete indivisibles\ncompose an extended continuum.\n\nNotice every concept in the cluster gets its due, except the concept\ncomposing, which is never contradicted, but rather\nframes the whole argument; together with his discussion of \u201cin\nsuccession\u201d it gives us the four cases and helps insure they are\nexhaustive. We can detect a nice symmetry in the touching argument\nthus analyzed:\n\n\n(1) Discrete indivisibles that touch have a problem composing extended\ncontinua. There are two ways to view their touching, compositionally\nspeaking: (a) the first undermines the extension of the continuum they\nallegedly compose, (b) the second undermines their own\nindivisibility.\n\n(2) Discrete indivisibles that do not touch also have a problem\ncomposing extended continua. There are two ways to view their\nnon-touching, compositionally speaking: (a) the first undermines the\ncontinuity of the continuum they allegedly compose, (b) the second\nundermines their own discreteness.\n\n\nMoreover, in the same chapter of the Physics Aristotle gives\nanother anti-indivisibilist argument that supplements or works with or\nperhaps overlaps the touching argument (it is not easy to say exactly\nwhat he intended). Chatton tends to treat it as if it is somewhat\nseparable, or at least as if it requires additional response. We might\nview it as an attempt to address the concept of\ncomposing. This second argument connects\ncomposition and infinite divisibility in continua, but in an\nanti-indivisibilist vein, and can be reconstructed as follows:\n\n\nEverything composed of certain realities is divisible into those\nrealities as parts, and everything divisible into parts must have\nthose parts touching each other while they are in it. Now continua are\ncomposed either of divisible realities or indivisible realities. If\ninto divisible realities, then these parts touch by sharing a\nboundary, and there is no problem; they form a continuum and are\nthemselves divisible, in fact infinitely divisible. If into\nindivisible realities, then these realities must touch, and we have\nall the problems the touching argument brought out under cases (1a)\nand (1b). Therefore, continua are composed exclusively of divisibles,\nare divisible exclusively into divisibles, and are infinitely\ndivisible. (see Physics, VII.1, 231b10\u201317)\n\n\nWe can distill all of this into a single statement resembling a\nslogan:\n\n\nDiscrete indivisibles have a problem composing extended continua:\ninsofar as they are indivisible, they cannot compose anything\nextended; insofar as they are discrete, they cannot compose anything\ncontinuous.\n\n\nThe slogan makes it easy to understand why Aristotle\u2019s\nanti-indivisibilist arguments were felt by many in Chatton\u2019s\ntime to be decisive on the issue of indivisibles and the continuum.\nWhen stated in this way anti-indivisibilism sounds almost like common\nsense. But Chatton thought this was an illusion.\n",
