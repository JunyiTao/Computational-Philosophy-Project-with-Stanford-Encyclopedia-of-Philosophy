So, for\ninstance, aesthetic goodness will be determined (in a sense to be\ndiscussed in\n \u00a71.3)\n by the operation of the sense of imagination. Honorable actions will\nbe determined by the operation of the sense of honor. Morally good\nactions will be determined by the operation of the moral sense, and so\non. But one might wonder whether there is such a ready distinction\nbetween the internal senses. Given that we can form new ideas given\ntheir comparison, and derive pleasure from them, why believe that\nthere is such a sharp distinction between, e.g., the sense of\nimagination and the moral sense? Put another way, what\nindividuates these senses, sufficient to distinguish\nevaluative modes?\n\nGenerally, Hutcheson appears to individuate senses by the sorts of\nthings that generate the particular ideas/pleasures involved. For\ninstance, he suggests that \u201cHarmony\u201d \u201cdenotes our\npleasant Ideas arising from Composition of Sounds\u201d\n(Inquiry 23). Here we know it is the sense of harmony, rather\nthan, e.g., the moral sense, because the pleasure we take is given\nrise by the \u201ccomposition of sounds\u201d. The pleasures of the\npublick sense arise as a result of the consideration of others\u2019\nhappiness and misery (Essay, 17). The pleasures of the sense\nof dignity arise from others\u2019 assessment of us, and so on.\n\nHowever, the moral sense has a further characteristic feature that the\nother internal senses, and hence other evaluative modes, do not.\nHutcheson\u2019s earliest reference to the moral sense runs as\nfollows:\n\n\n[S]ome Actions have to Men an immediate Goodness; \u2026by a\nsuperior Sense, which I call a Moral one, we perceive pleasure in the\nContemplation of such Actions in others, and are determin\u2019d to\nlove the Agent, (and much more do we perceive Pleasure in being\nconscious of having done such Actions our selves) without any View of\nfurther natural Advantage from them. (Inquiry, 88)\n\n\nHere it appears that Hutcheson holds that the moral sense is that\nwhich takes pleasure in actions. But it is also the case that\nthe moral sense, aside from a distinctive input, as it were, maintains\na distinctive output: love of the agent. Later editions of\nthe Inquiry also identify this output as \u201cthe simple\nideas of Approbation and Condemnation\u201d (Inquiry,\n217n45) (see Darwall 1995: 210).\n\nBut it would appear that, for Hutcheson, the senses\u2014and with\nthem the evaluative modes\u2014are distinguished by the object\nsortals to which they apply.\n",
