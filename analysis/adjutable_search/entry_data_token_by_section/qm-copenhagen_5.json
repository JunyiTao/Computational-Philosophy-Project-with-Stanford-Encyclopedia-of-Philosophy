    "main_text": "The Interpretation of the Quantum Formalism\n6. The Interpretation of the Quantum Formalism\n\nClassical concepts serve the important function of connecting the\nquantum mechanical symbolism with experimental observations. If one\naccepts that Bohr\u2019s grasp of physics began with his\nunderstanding of the role of physical experiments, this understanding\nhad strong implications for his empirical interpretation of the\nquantum formalism. The modern scholarly debate has taken Bohr to be an\ninstrumentalist, an objective anti-realist (Faye 1991), a\nphenomenological realist (Shomar 2008), or a realist of various sorts\n(Folse 1985, 1994; Favrholdt 1994; MacKinnon 1994; Howard 1994, 2004;\nZinkernagel 2015, 2016). But very often the various participants do\nnot give an exact specification of how they understand these terms and\nhow these terms apply to Bohr\u2019s thinking. The whole discussion\nbecomes confused because different authors use terms like\n\u201crealism\u201d and \u201cantirealism\u201d differently in\nrelation to Bohr. For instance, Faye (1991) holds that Bohr is an\nentity realist but a non-representationalist concerning theories.\nTherefore he calls Bohr an objective antirealist. In contrast, Folse\n(1986) who also sees Bohr as both a entity realist and a theoretical\nnon-representationalist calls him a realist. Moreover, Bohr himself\nwould probably refuse to put any such labels on his own view.\n\nIt is certain that Bohr regarded atomic objects as real\n(ATDN, p.93 and p.103). Their existence has been confirmed by\ncountless experiments. Hence, phrased in a modern terminology Bohr\nmight be classified as an entity realist in the sense that\nexperiments reveal their classical properties in relation to an\nexperimental set-up. Such a view does not fit traditional\ninstrumentalism where the introduction of unobservable entities is a\nlogical construction in order to classify various empirical\nobservations together. But entity realism corresponds with objective\nanti-realism, phenomenological realist, and all other forms of realism\nbecause it does not indicate anything about one\u2019s attitude\ntowards theories. A further issue is then how to interpret a physical\ntheory. Does or doesn\u2019t the quantum formalism, according to\nBohr, represent the world over and above being a tool for prediction?\n\n\nHere are four statements which seem to show that Bohr was an\ninstrumentalist concerning scientific theories in general and the\nquantum formalism in particular.\n\nThe purpose of scientific theories \u201cis not to disclose the\nreal essence of phenomena but only to track down, so far as it is\npossible, relations between the manifold aspects of experience\u201d\n(APHK, p.71).\n\u201cThe ingenious formalism of quantum mechanics, which\nabandons pictorial representation and aims directly at a statistical\naccount of quantum processes \u2026\u201d (CC, p.\n152).\n\u201cThe formalism thus defies pictorial representation and aims\ndirectly at prediction of observations appearing under well-defined\nconditions\u201d (CC, p. 172).\n\u201cThe entire formalism is to be considered as a tool for\nderiving predictions of definite and statistical character\n\u2026\u201d (CC, p. 144).\n\n\nIn these four statements Bohr mentions the absence of \u201cpictorial\nrepresentation\u201d twice in relation to the quantum formalism. The\nterm \u201cpictorial representation\u201d stands for a\nrepresentation that helps us to visualize what it represents in\ncontrast to \u201csymbolic representation\u201d. A pictorial\nrepresentation is a formalism that has an isomorphic relation to the\nobjects it represents such that the visualized structure of the\nrepresentation corresponds to a similar structure in nature.\nConversely, a symbolic representation does not stand for anything\nvisualizable. It is an abstract tool whose function it is to calculate\na result whenever this representation is applied to an experimental\nsituation. With respect to the formalism of quantum mechanics it is\nparticularly one\u2019s interpretation of the wave function that\ndetermines whether one thinks of it symbolically as a tool for\ncalculation of statistical outcomes or thinks of is as representing a\nreal physical field.\n\nIn a close reading of the Como-paper, Dennis Dieks reaches the\nconclusion that \u201cThe notion that the lecture is meant to\npromulgate an instrumentalist interpretation of quantum theory\naccording to which the whole formalism possesses only mathematical and\nno physical descriptive content is thus immediately seen to sit\nuneasily with the textual evidence.\u201d (Dieks 2017, p.305). In\nother words, Dieks goes against the more general interpretation of\nBohr according to which Bohr only believed that the wave function\nformalism is a mere tool for prediction. Just because Bohr writes off\nquantum formalism as a pictoral representation, it still gives us some\ninsight into physical reality. First, Dieks points to another of\nBohr\u2019s argument against seeing Sch\u00f6dinger\u2019s wave\nfunction as representing anything real. This argument concerns the\nfact that the wave function in quantum mechanics cannot represent a\nthree-dimensional entity.\n\n\nBohr himself tells us that his second argument, about the\ndimensionality of configuration space, is the most important one:\n\u201cabove all there can be no question of an immediate\nconnexion with our ordinary conceptions because... the wave equation\nis associated with the so-called co-ordinate space.\u201d In other\nwords, the Schr\u00f6dinger wave in the case of a many-particle system\ncannot be a physical wave in three-dimensional space (which would be\nan \u201cordinary conception\u201d) since it \u201clives\u201d in\na high-dimensional mathematical space (Dieks 2017, p.308).\n\n\nThen Dieks argues that even though this is an argument against wave\nfunction realism, it is not an argument that excludes the wave\nfunction from containing information about the quantum world. Dieks\ncompares this argument to the one that denies phase space realism.\n\u201cWe can consistently deny the physical reality of phase space\nand still be realists with respect to particles. So we should not\nmistake Bohr\u2019s argument for the symbolic character of the wave\nfunction for an argument in favor of instrumentalism tout\ncourt\u201d (Dieks 2017, p. 308). The difference between\nclassical many-particles system placed in a phase space and a system\nof quantum objects placed in the configuration space is, however, that\nthe description of many particles in phase space can be decomposed\ninto a description of single particles in three-dimensional physical\nspace, whereas the sum of the quantum waves associated with many\nparticles in configuration space yields yet another superimposed\nquantum wave, which cannot be decomposed into a description of single\nparticles in three-dimensional space. Dieks then continues to show how\nthe structural features of the quantum formalism guided Bohr in his\ninterpretation of quantum mechanism. Likewise, he argues that\nBohr\u2019s pronouncements on the meaning of quantum mechanics should\nfirst of all be seen as responses to concrete physical problems,\nrather than as expressions of a preconceived philosophical doctrine.\nHis analysis results in a finding that Bohr\u2019s qualitative\ninterpretation is in line with modern non-collapse theories.\n",
