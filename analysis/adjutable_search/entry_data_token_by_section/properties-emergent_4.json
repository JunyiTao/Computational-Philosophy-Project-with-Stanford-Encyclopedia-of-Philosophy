    "main_text": "Weak Emergence\n3. Weak Emergence\n\nWeak emergence affirms the reality of entities and features posited in\nthe special sciences, while also affirming physicalism, the thesis\nthat all natural phenomena are wholly constituted and completely\nmetaphysically determined by fundamental physical phenomena, entailing\nthat any fundamental-level physical effect has a purely fundamental\nphysical cause.\n\nSpecial sciences describe non-ubiquitous, structured phenomena (e.g.,\nplate tectonics, molecular interactions, cellular repair, and\norganismic development) and successfully predict their behavior\nthrough higher-level laws. Weak emergentists take the existence of\nsuch stable and distinctive phenomena, amenable to high-level but not\nlow-level explanation, as reason to accept the taxonomic categories of\nthe special sciences into our ontology of the natural world, no less\nreal than the categories of a final, completed physics. On this view,\nthere are molecules, cells, organisms, and minded creatures,\nand they do not reduce to\u2014are not identical to\u2014complex\ncombinations of basic physical entities or features. Correspondingly,\nexplanations adverting to special science laws are to some extent\nautonomous from the explanations adverting to laws of lower-level\nphysical theories.\n",
