    "main_text": "The Rights and Duties of Gamete Donors\n1. The Rights and Duties of Gamete Donors\n\nThe rights and responsibilities that attach to parenthood are\ngenerally understood to be very weighty. Consequently, determining\nwhether or not gamete donors are parents is a question that has\nattracted much attention. But even if gamete donors are not parents in\nthe deeper ethical sense, they may still have considerable rights and\nobligations towards their biological offspring. While there is\nconsiderable overlap here with the parenthood literature (see the entry on\n parenthood and procreation)\n questions about parenthood in the context of gamete donation have\ngarnered much specific attention. In what follows we will examine\nthree distinctive questions that have emerged: (1) Are gamete donors\nparents? (2) Can parental responsibilities be transferred to others?\n(3) Do gamete providers acquire any non-parental obligations?\n",
