This is one of the\ndifficult questions that chaos theory raises for the epistemology of\ndeterminism.\n\nA deterministic chaotic system has, roughly speaking, two salient\nfeatures: (i) the evolution of the system over a long time period\neffectively mimics a random or stochastic process\u2014it lacks\npredictability or computability in some appropriate sense; (ii) two\nsystems with nearly identical initial states will have radically\ndivergent future developments, within a finite (and typically, short)\ntimespan. We will use \u201crandomness\u201d to denote the first\nfeature, and \u201csensitive dependence on initial conditions\u201d\n(SDIC) for the latter. Definitions of chaos may focus on either or\nboth of these properties; Batterman (1993) argues that only (ii)\nprovides an appropriate basis for defining chaotic systems.\n\nA simple and very important example of a chaotic system in both\nrandomness and SDIC terms is the Newtonian dynamics of a pool table\nwith a convex obstacle (or obstacles) (Sinai 1970 and others). See\n Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Billiard table with convex\nobstacle\n\n\n\nThe usual idealizing assumptions are made: no friction, perfectly\nelastic collisions, no outside influences. The ball\u2019s trajectory\nis determined by its initial position and direction of motion. If we\nimagine a slightly different initial direction, the\ntrajectory will at first be only slightly different. And collisions\nwith the straight walls will not tend to increase very rapidly the\ndifference between trajectories. But collisions with the convex object\nwill have the effect of amplifying the differences. After\nseveral collisions with the convex body or bodies, trajectories that\nstarted out very close to one another will have become wildly\ndifferent\u2014SDIC.\n\n\nIn the example of the billiard table, we know that we are starting out\nwith a Newtonian deterministic system\u2014that is how the idealized\nexample is defined. But chaotic dynamical systems come in a great\nvariety of types: discrete and continuous, 2-dimensional,\n3-dimensional and higher, particle-based and fluid-flow-based, and so\non. Mathematically, we may suppose all of these systems share SDIC.\nBut generally they will also display properties such as\nunpredictability, non-computability, Kolmogorov-random behavior, and\nso on\u2014at least when looked at in the right way, or at the right\nlevel of detail. This leads to the following epistemic difficulty: if,\nin nature, we find a type of system that displays some or all of these\nlatter properties, how can we decide which of the following two\nhypotheses is true?\n\nThe system is governed by genuinely stochastic, indeterministic\nlaws (or by no laws at all), i.e., its apparent randomness is in fact\nreal randomness.\nThe system is governed by underlying deterministic laws, but is\nchaotic.\n\n\nIn other words, once one appreciates the varieties of chaotic\ndynamical systems that exist, mathematically speaking, it\nstarts to look difficult\u2014maybe impossible\u2014for us to ever\ndecide whether apparently random behavior in nature arises from\ngenuine stochasticity, or rather from deterministic chaos. Patrick\nSuppes (1993, 1996) argues, on the basis of theorems proven by\nOrnstein (1974 and later) that \u201cThere are processes which can\nequally well be analyzed as deterministic systems of classical\nmechanics or as indeterministic semi-Markov processes, no matter how\nmany observations are made.\u201d And he concludes that\n\u201cDeterministic metaphysicians can comfortably hold to their view\nknowing they cannot be empirically refuted, but so can indeterministic\nones as well.\u201d (Suppes 1993, p. 254) For more recent works\nexploring the extent to which deterministic and indeterministic model\nsystems may be regarded as empirically indistinguishable, see Werndl\n(2016) and references therein.\n\nThere is certainly an interesting problem area here for the\nepistemology of determinism, but it must be handled with care. It may\nwell be true that there are some deterministic dynamical systems that,\nwhen viewed properly, display behavior indistinguishable from\nthat of a genuinely stochastic process. For example, using the\nbilliard table above, if one divides its surface into quadrants and\nlooks at which quadrant the ball is in at 30-second intervals, the\nresulting sequence is no doubt highly random. But this does not mean\nthat the same system, when viewed in a different way (perhaps\nat a higher degree of precision) does not cease to look random and\ninstead betray its deterministic nature. If we partition our billiard\ntable into squares 2 centimeters a side and look at which quadrant the\nball is in at .1 second intervals, the resulting sequence will be far\nfrom random. And finally, of course, if we simply look at the billiard\ntable with our eyes, and see it as a billiard table, there is\nno obvious way at all to maintain that it may be a truly random\nprocess rather than a deterministic dynamical system. (See Winnie 1997\nfor a nice technical and philosophical discussion of these issues.\nWinnie explicates Ornstein\u2019s and others\u2019 results in some\ndetail, and disputes Suppes\u2019 philosophical conclusions.)\n\nThe dynamical systems usually studied under the label of\n\u201cchaos\u201d are usually either purely abstract, mathematical\nsystems, or classical Newtonian systems. It is natural to wonder\nwhether chaotic behavior carries over into the realm of systems\ngoverned by quantum mechanics as well. Interestingly, it is much\nharder to find natural correlates of classical chaotic behavior in\ntrue quantum systems (see Gutzwiller 1990). Some, at least, of the\ninterpretive difficulties of quantum mechanics would have to be\nresolved before a meaningful assessment of chaos in quantum mechanics\ncould be achieved. For example, SDIC is hard to find in the\nSchr\u00f6dinger evolution of a wavefunction for a system with finite\ndegrees of freedom; but in\n Bohmian quantum mechanics\n it is handled quite easily on the basis of particle trajectories (see\nD\u00fcrr, Goldstein and Zhang\u00ec 1992).\n\nThe popularization of chaos theory in the relatively recent past\nperhaps made it seem self-evident that nature is full of genuinely\nchaotic systems. In fact, it is far from self-evident that such\nsystems exist, other than in an approximate sense. Nevertheless, the\nmathematical exploration of chaos in dynamical systems helps us to\nunderstand some of the pitfalls that may attend our efforts to know\nwhether our world is genuinely deterministic or not.\n",
