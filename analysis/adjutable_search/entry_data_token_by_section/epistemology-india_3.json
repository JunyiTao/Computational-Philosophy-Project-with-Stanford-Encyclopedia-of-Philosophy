    "main_text": "Common Presuppositions of Classical Indian Schools || Knowledge and World-Transcendence\n1.3 Knowledge and World-Transcendence\nThere is much controversy over the religious goal of life among the\nseveral schools, both among schools accepting Vedic culture (liberation\nvs. heaven, individual dissolution into the Absolute Brahman, blissful\nyogic \u201cisolation,\u201d kaivalya, enjoyment of God\u2019s presence) and\namong outsider schools (Buddhist\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a or becoming a\nbodhi-sattva or a Jaina arhat as well as\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka\u2019s entire rejection of soteriology). But from a\ndistance, we can see common conceptions linking at least many of the\nIndian views. One is to draw a distinction between everyday and\nspiritual knowledge and to theorize about their relationship. A\nprominent position is that thinking about the world is an obstacle to\nspiritual enlightenment. Another is that proper understanding of the\nworld helps one disengage and to know oneself as separate from material\nthings, and so is an aid to transcendence. The most distinctive form of\nskepticism in classical Indian thought is that so-called worldly\nknowledge is not knowledge at all but is a perversion or deformation of\nconsciousness. Who seems a philosophical skeptic is really a saint\nhelping us achieve our truly greatest good of world-transcendence by\nhelping us see paradoxes and other failures of theory.\n",
