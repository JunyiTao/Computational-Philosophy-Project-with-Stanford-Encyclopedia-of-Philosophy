    "main_text": "Physics: The Critical Period (Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science) || Mechanics\n2.4 Mechanics\n\nThe third chapter of Kant\u2019s Metaphysical Foundations,\nthe Mechanics, concerns how it is possible to experience matter as\nhaving a moving force, that is, how one matter communicates its motion\nto another by means of its moving force. Kant begins, in Proposition\n1, by clarifying how the quantity of matter is to be estimated before\nstating, in Propositions 2\u20134, three Laws of Mechanics.\n\nAfter first defining the quantity of matter and the quantity of motion\n(or, in contemporary terms, impulse, i=mv), Kant\nasserts that the quantity of matter, in comparison with every\nother matter, can be estimated only by the quantity of motion at a\ngiven speed (4:537). Kant\u2019s proof proceeds by way of\nelimination. The quantity of matter, which is the aggregate of the\nmovable in a determinate space, cannot be estimated by counting the\nnumber of parts it has, since, as was established in the Dynamics,\nevery matter is infinitely divisible. Nor can one estimate the\nquantity of matter merely by considering its volume, since different\nmatters can have different specific densities. As a result, the only\nuniversally applicable way of estimating the quantity of matter is to\nhold the velocity of matter constant.\n\nIn Proposition 2, Kant states his First Law of Mechanics: the total\nquantity of matter remains the same throughout all changes in matter\n(4:541). His proof seems to rely (i) on the principle of the First\nAnalogy of Experience that no substance arises or perishes throughout\nany change in nature and (ii) on the identification of what in matter\nmust be substantial. On this latter point, Kant quickly assumes that\nthe ultimate subject of all accidents inhering in matter must be the\nmovable in space, and that its quantity is the aggregate of the\nmovable in space. In his remark to this proposition, Kant explicitly\nnotes that there is a crucial difference between spatial and\nnon-spatial substances, since the latter, unlike the former, could\ngradually fade away by degrees. (Kant cites the possibility of\nconsciousness as a concrete example.) Kant uses this difference to\nargue that since the quantity of matter consists in a plurality of\nreal things external to each other that cannot fade away (as\nconsciousness might), the only way to decrease its quantity is by\ndivision.\n\nKant\u2019s Second Law of Mechanics, stated in Proposition 3, is that\nevery change in matter has an external cause. (Immediately after this\nprinciple, Kant adds in parentheses a version of the law of inertia\nthat is much closer to Newton\u2019s: \u201cevery body persists in\nits state of rest or motion, in the same direction, and with the same\nspeed, if it is not compelled by an external cause to leave this\nstate\u201d (4:543). Since Kant\u2019s Second Law of Mechanics is\nnot identical to Newton\u2019s law of inertia, it would require\nargument to show that, and by means of what additional assumptions,\nthe former entails the latter.) The proof of the main principle\ndepends on the Second Analogy of Experience (which asserts that all\nchanges occur in accordance with the law of cause and effect and thus\nentails that every change in matter has a cause) as well as on the\nfurther assumption that matter has no internal grounds of\ndeterminations (such as thinking and desiring), but rather only\nexternal relations in space. In his remark to this proposition, which\nclarifies this \u201claw of inertia,\u201d Kant explains that\ninertia is to be contrasted with life or the ability of a substance to\ndetermine itself to act from an internal principle. Thus, a\nbody\u2019s inertia \u201cdoes not mean a positive striving\nto conserve its state\u201d (4:544), but rather what it does\nnot do, its lifelessness.\n\nKant also asserts that the very possibility of natural science proper\ndepends on the law of inertia, since the rejection of it would be\nhylozoism, \u201cthe death of all natural philosophy\u201d (4:544).\nIn a later remark in the Mechanics, Kant explicitly objects that\n\u201cthe terminology of inertial force (vis inertiae) must\nbe entirely banished from natural science, not only because it carries\nwith it a contradiction in terms, nor even because the law of inertia\n(lifelessness) might thereby be easily confused with the law of\nreaction in every communicated motion, but primarily because the\nmistaken idea of those who are not properly acquainted with the\nmechanical laws is thereby maintained and even strengthened\u201d\n(4:550). Kant goes on to point out that if inertia were to entail an\nactive force of resistance, then it would be possible that when one\nmoving body hits another, the moving body has to apply part of its\nmotion solely to overcome the inertia of the one at rest and might not\nhave any motion left over, as it were, to set the body at rest into\nmotion, which is contrary to experience (and Proposition 2).\n\nKant\u2019s Third Law of Mechanics, expressed in Proposition 4,\nasserts the equality of action and reaction in the communication of\nmotion. Kant formulates a version of the Third Analogy of Experience\n(according to which all external action in the world is interaction)\nand suggests that the main point at issue in mechanics is establishing\nthat mutual action is necessarily reaction. Kant\u2019s\nargument for this law is based on the following line of thought: (i)\nif all changes of matter are changes of motion; (ii) if all changes of\nmotion are reciprocal and equal (since one body cannot move closer\nto/farther away from another body without the second body moving\ncloser to/farther away from the first body and by exactly the same\namount); and (iii) if every change of matter has an external cause (a\nproposition that was established as the Second Law of Mechanics), then\nthe cause of the change of motion of the one body entails an equal and\nopposite cause of a change of motion of the other body or, in short,\naction must be equal to reaction.\n\nKant\u2019s Laws of Mechanics have been discussed widely in the\nsecondary literature. Especially helpful discussions are Friedman\n(1989, 1992), Brittan (1995), Westphal (1995), Carrier (2001), and\nWatkins (1997 and 1998b). The most sustained and through discussion of\nthem is in Watkins (2019). Much of the modern tradition of scholarship\nused to regard Kant\u2019s laws of mechanics as derived from, or even\nidentical with, Newton\u2019s three laws in the Principia.\nWatkins (2019) shows that Kant\u2019s formulation and justification\nof his laws was strongly influenced by a philosophy of nature stemming\nfrom Leibniz, not Newton. Stan (2013) further corroborates these\nfindings. As a result, it is safe to say that Kant\u2019s foundations\nof mechanics were significantly shaped by post-Leibnizian rationalism\ntoo, not just Newton\u2019s mechanics. This fact is now reflected in\nFriedman (2013), the most recent and detailed account of Kant\u2019s\ninterpretation of the conceptual foundations of mechanics. Stan (2014)\nexamines the conceptual link between Kant\u2019s theory of matter and\nhis laws of mechanics.\n",
