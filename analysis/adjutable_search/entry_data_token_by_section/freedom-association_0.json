Kinds of Associations\n\nIn taxonomizing the different associations to which we typically\nbelong, we should note the contrast drawn in the literature between\nintimate associations and collective associations.\nThis contrast is somewhat forced since, in reality, these association\ntypes are fluid. First, our various collegial, fraternal, romantic,\npolitical, creedal, professional, recreational, and philanthropic\nassociations can have both intimate and collective aspects (Alexander\n2008: 13). Falling in love at work or at school can change the meaning\nof those associations for the people involved. Second, all\nconsequential associations\u2014be they intimate or\ncollective\u2014are sites in which our beliefs are formed and their\nexpression germinated (Shiffrin 2005: 841). Third, interesting\ncontrasts\u2014such as the contrast between voluntary and\nnon-voluntary associations or between hierarchical and\nnon-hierarchical associations\u2014cut across any distinction we\nmight draw between intimate and collective associations. Both\nnon-voluntary associations and hierarchical associations are to be\nfound in intimate settings, educational settings, and national\nsettings, to name just a few, and these have constitutive power over\nthe ways we view our lives (Walzer 2004: 1\u201320). Finally, a key\nargument for protecting associations\u2014that they help to safeguard\nour individual freedom\u2014applies to all manner of\nassociations.\n\nConsequently, our associations are possibly better understood as\nfalling along a continuum that ranges from the more intimate and\nnon-instrumental at one end to the more impersonal and instrumental at\nthe other (Brownlee 2015: 269). Despite this fluidity, the distinction\nbetween intimate associations and collective\nassociations remains useful since it identifies the central\nfunction of a given association. For instance, while it is possible to\nmeet our spouse at work and to form friendships at work, doing these\nthings is not the primary function of work environments and workplace\nassociations. The fact that workplace settings can serve this\nsecondary, or unintended, function of fostering intimate ties should\nnot dictate or, in some cases, even influence the forms that workplace\nassociations take. Hence, this entry retains the traditional contrast\nbetween intimate associations and collective associations in order to\nhighlight the conceptual and normative issues that are particularly\nsalient to specific paradigmatic forms of associations.\n",
