    "main_text": "What is Behaviorism?\n1. What is Behaviorism?\n\nOne has to be careful with \u201cism\u201d words. They often have\nboth loose and strict meanings. And sometimes multiple meanings of\neach type. \u2018Behaviorism\u2019 is no exception. Loosely\nspeaking, behaviorism is an attitude \u2013 a way of conceiving of\nempirical constraints on psychological state attribution. Strictly\nspeaking, behaviorism is a doctrine \u2013 a way of doing\npsychological or behavioral science itself.\n\nWilfred Sellars (1912\u201389), the distinguished philosopher, noted\nthat a person may qualify as a behaviorist, loosely or attitudinally\nspeaking, if they insist on confirming \u201chypotheses about\npsychological events in terms of behavioral criteria\u201d (1963, p.\n22). A behaviorist, so understood, is someone who demands behavioral\nevidence for any psychological hypothesis. For such a person, there is\nno knowable difference between two states of mind (beliefs, desires,\netc.) unless there is a demonstrable difference in the behavior\nassociated with each state. Consider the current belief of a person\nthat it is raining. If there is no difference in his or her behavior\nbetween believing that it is raining and believing that it is not\nraining, there is no grounds for attributing the one belief rather\nthan the other. The attribution is empirically empty or unconstrained.\n\n\nArguably, there is nothing truly exciting about behaviorism loosely\nunderstood. It enthrones behavioral evidence, an arguably inescapable\npremise not just in psychological science but in ordinary discourse\nabout mind and behavior. Just how behavioral evidence should be\n\u2018enthroned\u2019 (especially in science) may be debated. But\nenthronement itself is not in question.\n\nNot so behaviorism the doctrine. It has been widely and vigorously\ndebated. This entry is about the doctrine, not the attitude.\nBehaviorism, the doctrine, has caused considerable excitation among\nboth advocates and critics. In a manner of speaking, it is a doctrine,\nor family of doctrines, about how to enthrone behavior not just in the\nscience of psychology but in the metaphysics of human and animal\nbehavior.\n\nBehaviorism, the doctrine, is committed in its fullest and most\ncomplete sense to the truth of the following three sets of claims.\n\nPsychology is the science of behavior. Psychology is not the\nscience of the inner mind \u2013 as something other or different from\nbehavior.\nBehavior can be described and explained without making ultimate\nreference to mental events or to internal psychological processes. The\nsources of behavior are external (in the environment), not internal\n(in the mind, in the head).\nIn the course of theory development in psychology, if, somehow,\nmental terms or concepts are deployed in describing or explaining\nbehavior, then either (a) these terms or concepts should be eliminated\nand replaced by behavioral terms or (b) they can and should be\ntranslated or paraphrased into behavioral concepts.\n\n\nThe three sets of claims are logically distinct. Moreover, taken\nindependently, each helps to form a type of behaviorism.\n\u201cMethodological\u201d behaviorism is committed to the truth of\n(1). \u201cPsychological\u201d behaviorism is committed to the truth\nof (2). \u201cAnalytical\u201d behaviorism (also known as\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d or \u201clogical\u201d behaviorism) is\ncommitted to the truth of the sub-statement in (3) that mental terms\nor concepts can and should be translated into behavioral concepts.\n\nOther nomenclature is sometimes used to classify behaviorisms. Georges\nRey (1997, p. 96), for example, classifies behaviorisms as\nmethodological, analytical, and radical, where \u201cradical\u201d\nis Rey\u2019s term for what is here classified as psychological\nbehaviorism. The term \u201cradical\u201d is instead reserved for\nthe psychological behaviorism of B. F. Skinner. Skinner employs the\nexpression \u201cradical behaviorism\u201d to describe his brand of\nbehaviorism or his philosophy of behaviorism (see Skinner 1974, p.\n18). In the classification scheme used in this entry, radical\nbehaviorism is a sub-type of psychological behaviorism, primarily,\nalthough it combines all three types of behaviorism (methodological,\nanalytical, and psychological).\n",
