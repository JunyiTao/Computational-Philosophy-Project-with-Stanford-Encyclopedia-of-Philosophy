    "main_text": "Regularity Theories of Causation || Regularities and Laws\n1.2 Regularities and Laws\n\nMill (1843) refined the Humean Regularity Theory of causation. An\neffect usually occurs only due to several instantiated factors, that\nis, instantiated event types. He distinguishes between positive and\nnegative factors. Let \\(C_1,\\) \\(C_2,\\) \u2026, \\(C_n\\) be a set of\npositive factors and \\(\\overline{D}_1,\\) \\(\\overline{D}_2,\\) \u2026,\n\\(\\overline{D}_m\\) a set of negative factors which are together\nsufficient for an effect \\(E\\). Mill says that the totality of present\npositive and absent negative factors sufficient for an effect to occur\nis the cause of this effect. In symbols, the totality of the token\nevents \\(c_1,\\) \\(c_2,\\) \u2026, \\(c_n\\) and the absence of any\ntoken events of the types \\(D_1,\\) \\(D_2,\\) \u2026, \\(D_m\\) is a\ncause of an occurring event \\(e\\) iff \\(C_1,\\) \\(C_2,\\) \u2026,\n\\(C_n,\\) \\(\\overline{D}_1,\\) \\(\\overline{D}_2,\\) \u2026,\n\\(\\overline{D}_m\\) is sufficient for \\(E\\).\n\nFurthermore, Mill claims that causation requires lawlike regularities.\nMere regular association is not enough. The cry of a cock (as part of\na totality of conditions) precedes the rise of the sun and the former\nis invariably followed by the latter, and yet the cry of a cock does\nnot count as a cause of the sunrise. For the regularity is not a law\nof nature, it is a mere accidental regularity.\n\nThe Millian Regularity Theory (MRT) can be summarized as follows:\n\nThe totality of present positive factors \\(\\{ C_{1-n} \\}\\) and absent\nnegative factors \\(\\{ \\overline{D}_{1-m} \\}\\) is a cause of an event\n\\(e\\) of type \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\n\nthere are events of type \\(C_1,\\) \\(C_2,\\) \u2026, \\(C_n\\) which are\nspatiotemporally contiguous to \\(e\\) and there are no such events of\ntype \\(D_1,\\) \\(D_2,\\) \u2026, \\(D_m\\), \n(ii)\n\n\nthe events of type \\(C_1,\\) \\(C_2,\\) \u2026, \\(C_n\\) precede \\(e\\)\nin time, and \n(iii)\n\n\nit is a law of nature that an instantiation of all positive\nfactors \\(\\{ C_{1-n} \\}\\) is followed by an instantiation of factor\n\\(E\\) when none of the negative factors \\(\\{ D_{1-m} \\}\\) is\ninstantiated. \n\n\nWhat are laws of nature? Well, on a regularity theory of causation, a\nlaw is a regularity understood as a stable pattern of\nevents\u2014nothing more, nothing less. And yet, laws are still\nspecial regularities. According to Mill (1843), regularities which\nsubsume other true regularities are more general than the subsumed\nones. The laws of nature are those regularities which are the most\ngeneral. They thus organise our knowledge of the world in an ideal\ndeductive system which strikes the best balance between simplicity and\nstrength (see, e.g., 1843: Book III, Ch. XII). This best system\naccount of laws has been further developed by Ramsey and Lewis. Ramsey\nputs it as follows,\n\n\neven if we knew everything, we should still want to systematize our\nknowledge as a deductive system, and the general axioms in that system\nwould be the fundamental laws of nature. The choice of axioms is bound\nto some extent to be arbitrary, but what is less likely to be\narbitrary if any simplicity is to be preserved is a body of\nfundamental generalizations, some to be taken as axioms and others\ndeduced. (1928 [1978: 131])\n\n\nEverything else being equal, a system with fewer axioms is simpler.\nSimplicity thus demands the pruning of inessential elements from the\nsystem of laws. A deductive system is stronger when it entails more\ntruths. Strength demands that the deductive system of laws should be\nas informative as possible. Note that simplicity and strength compete.\nA system consisting of only one uncomplicated axiom is simple but not\nvery informative. A system which has one axiom for any truth is very\nstrong but far from simple. To avoid a deductive system that is too\nsimple to be informative and one that is too complicated, we need to\nbalance simplicity and strength. The proper balance between simplicity\nand strength makes the deductive system best.\n\nThere is no guarantee that there is a unique best deductive system. If\nthere is none, the laws of nature are those axioms and theorems that\nare common to all deductive systems that tie with respect to\nsimplicity and strength (or are at least good enough). D. Lewis thus\nsays that\n\n\na contingent generalization is a law of nature if and only if\nit appears as a theorem (or axiom) in each of the true deductive\nsystems that achieves a best combination of simplicity and strength.\n(1973: 73)\n\n\nAs a consequence, laws are simple and yet highly informative as a part\nof each best deductive system. The regularity about the cry of the\ncock and the sunrise is not part of a best deductive system. And\nwhichever regularity is not part of any best system is accidental: it\nis not a law of nature. The dividing line between laws and accidental\nregularities is determined by being a part of any best system. Note\nthat no regularity can be regarded as a law of nature in absence of a\nfull system.\n\nThere is a worry that the best system account of laws is infected by\nepistemic considerations. Of course, what truths a best system entails\nis an objective matter, it does not depend on our knowledge of it.\nWhether a truth is objectively implied by a best system, however,\ndepends on the way this system is organized. And there may be\nconsiderable leeway in choosing the axioms to obtain a simple system.\nThe worry is that the notion of simplicity is not fully objective, and\neven if it were, striking a balance between simplicity and strength is\nnot. Hence, which regularities are laws depends on epistemic criteria,\nour desiderata to organize our knowledge as simple as possible in a\ndeductive system. This is not to say that the lawlike regularities are\nmind-dependent. Laws and regularities are still patterns in the world\nindependent of our knowledge of them. What makes some of the\nregularities laws and some others not, however, is not only determined\nby the world. The law-making feature, striking a proper balance\nbetween simplicity and strength, seems to have an epistemic component.\nThis is presumably the cost for being free of substantive metaphysical\ncommitments. (For details on the best system account of laws, see\nthe entry on\n laws of nature.)\n\nWhat does the epistemic component mean for causation as lawlike\nregularity? The regularity is determined solely by the world, but the\nlawlikeness of a regularity rests, in part, on epistemic criteria. So,\nwhile causation is not arbitrary\u2014there must still be a\nregularity for causation\u2014there is an epistemic element in\nchoosing which regularities constitute causation. In brief, the\nregularities are mind-independent, what causes what is not.\n\nThe Humean regularity theory, where causation is instantiation of\nregularity, presupposes that events can be sorted into types. A type\nis a class of resembling events. Based on the best systems account, we\nmay now appeal to laws of nature in order to determine which events\nare similar and which are dissimilar. Suppose it is a law that all\nevents \\(a\\) of type \\(A\\) are followed by events \\(b\\) of type \\(B\\).\nThen the events or objects similar to \\(a\\) are just the other\ninstantiations of type \\(A\\), and likewise for type \\(B\\). But the\nlaw-making feature depends on epistemic considerations, and so the\ntypes determined by those laws depend on epistemic considerations.\nHence, falling back to a Humean regularity theory does not solve the\nissue. We still need a way to sort events into types. But which events\nresemble each other comes in degrees and depends on the respects of\ncomparison. The degrees of similarity and respects of comparison are\nnot fixed by the world understood as the collection of all particular\nspatiotemporal matters of fact. The degrees and respects are rather\nepistemic components which depend on the categories and classification\nschemes we use. A related problem are gerrymandered categories or\nproperties like \u201cgrue\u201d, as studied by Goodman (1955) in\nhis new riddle of induction.\n\nSome defenders of the regularity theory see the dependence on\nepistemic components as a problem. To solve it, one may want to posit\nthat there are natural properties which carve nature at its joints.\nThe idea is that those natural properties provide a fully objective\nclassification. Those natural properties would ensure that the lawlike\nregularities are free of epistemic components. However, what is\nnatural is notoriously difficult to define. Natural properties, which\nare objectively similar and dissimilar to each other, are thus often\nsimply posited as primitives which are not analysed further, as Lewis\n(1986: 60\u20132) does for example.\n",
