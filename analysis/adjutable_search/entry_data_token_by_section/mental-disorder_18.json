(See Hoffman 2019; Chapman & Carel 2022.) Negative\nsocial attitudes towards observable disorder have led to stigma,\nself-stigma, and discrimination (Hinshaw 2009). The madman and\nmadwoman have been the subject of fear, misunderstanding,\ndisparagement and condemnation, their failings exaggerated and\nhumanity denied (Gilman 1985). With modernity, care and protection\napparently replaced earlier, moralistic and neglectful arrangements.\n(The reforms\u2019 real effects and costs remain an unsettled matter\nof historical\n debate.[7]\n ) At the same time formal exceptions and protections, such as the\ninsanity defense, recognized mental disorder as an exculpating excuse\nfor wrongdoing and negligence. Despite such attitudinal change,\nhowever, these issues around responsibility remain contentious and\nunresolved (Pouncey & Lukens 2010; Singh, Sinnott-Armstrong &\nSavulescu 2013; Schramme 2014).\n\nThe effect of diagnoses on those so distinguished has been\ndemonstrated to be extensive, often personally transformative, and\nusually not benign. The extent of these effects has drawn research\nattention to first-person report, and to the eloquent madness memoirs\nincreasingly available for study. It has led to theorizing within\nformal philosophical writing, and also within the rhetoric of social\nmovements and identity-focused political interest groups (see\n \u00a710).\n The Recovery movement, for example, stresses the way the self and\nidentity are diminished by diagnosis, which erodes and occludes\nequally important and more positive, attributes making up the whole\nperson. (See Davidson 2013.) Critiques of diagnosis place emphasis on\nits dehumanizing and \u201cobjectifying\u201d effects that,\nmagnified by stigmatizing societal attitudes, engender self-stigma (\nHoffman & Hansen 2017; Hinshaw 2009; Thornicroft 2006). More\nrecently, however, social media and our hyperconnected contemporary\nexistence are seen as issuing in a less stigmatizing and\ndiscriminatory world, where some particular disorder diagnoses form\nsocial identities (Sulik 2011).\n",
