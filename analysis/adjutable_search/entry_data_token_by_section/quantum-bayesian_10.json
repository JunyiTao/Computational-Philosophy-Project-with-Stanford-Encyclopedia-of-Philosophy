    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Is the Born Rule a New Bayesian Norm?\n2.4 Is the Born Rule a New Bayesian Norm?\n\nBacciagaluppi (2014) has raised an objection against the claim that\nthe Born rule as formulated in Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) states an\nempirically motivated normative addition to Bayesian coherence\nconditions. His basic objection is that QBism assumes the probability\n\\(q(j)\\) of an actual measurement outcome (as also the probability\n\\(p(j)\\) of a hypothetical measurement outcome) is independent of the\nprocedure by which this measurement is performed. That this is so\nfollows from the usual formulation of the Born Rule relating Born\nprobabilities of measurement outcomes to quantum state assignments.\nBut QBism cannot justify the procedure-independence of \\(q(j)\\) and\n\\(p(j)\\) in this way because it considers the Born Rule in the form of\nEquation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) to be primitive, and so incapable of\nempirical support from the relation between quantum states and\noutcomes of laboratory procedures.\n\nThere are also technical problems with Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\), which\nassumes the existence of SICs in the relevant Hilbert space. But\ninfinite as well as finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are used in\nquantum theory, and SICs have not (yet) been shown to exist in every\nfinite\n dimension.[4]\n Informationally-complete (but not necessarily symmetric) POVMs do\nexist in all finite dimensional spaces. Fuchs and Schack (2015) give a\nschematic alternative to Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) that does not\nrequire symmetry of an informationally-complete POVM representing a\nhypothetical fiducial measurement.\n",
