    "main_text": "Further Results || The Interpolation Theorem\n6.2 The Interpolation Theorem\n\nThe Interpolation Theorem, which according to Wilfrid Hodges has\n\u201cthe longest pedigree of any theorem of model\n theory\u201d,[30]\n plays a relevant role in logic. In the first place, several important\nresults such us Beth\u2019s definability theorem and Robinson theorem\ncould be obtained directly from it (see the entry\n first-order model theory).\n In the second place, interpolation can be seen as a central logical\nproperty which \u201chas been used to reveal a deep harmony between\nsyntax and semantics\u201d (Feferman 2008: 341).\n\nThe one-sorted version of interpolation was proved by William Craig in\n1957a. Roger Lyndon (1959) gave a generalization of Craig\u2019s\ntheorem and, in 1968, Feferman extended the latter formulation to\nmany-sorted logic (see Feferman 2008: 349). Obviously, the one-sorted\nversion is a special case of the many-sorted one. However, many-sorted\ninterpolation cannot be straightforwardly transferred from the\none-sorted case.\n\nThe idea for Craig\u2019s 1957 proof of the Interpolation Theorem\nrests on the completeness theorem for one-sorted first-order logic.\nThe reason is that interpolation \u201clies\u201d somehow in the\nintersection of proof theory (as it follows from some metatheorems\nabout the calculus) and model theory (because of its applications).\nHenkin showed that the other way round also holds: completeness can be\nimmediately obtained from a extended\n version[31]\n of Craig-Lyndon\u2019s theorem.\n\nThe syntactical formulation of Craig\u2019s interpolation theorem\nreads as follows: If \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are sentences and\n\\(\\vdash \\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi\\), then:\n\n\\(\\Rel(\\varphi )\\cap \\Rel(\\psi )\\not=\\varnothing\\) implies that\nthere is an \u201cintermediate\u201d formula \\(\\theta\\) such that\n\\(\\vdash \\varphi \\rightarrow \\theta\\) and \\(\\vdash \\theta \\rightarrow\n\\psi\\) (\\(\\theta\\) is a sentence such that \\(\\Rel(\\theta )\\subseteq\n\\Rel(\\varphi )\\cap \\Rel(\\psi )\\)) and\n\\(\\Rel(\\varphi )\\cap \\Rel(\\psi )=\\varnothing\\) implies \\(\\vdash\n\\lnot \\varphi\\) or \\(\\vdash \\psi\\),\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Rel(\\alpha)\\) is the set of relational symbols in \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe intuition behind is as follows: during the process of proving the\nconditional formula \\(\\varphi \\rightarrow \\psi\\), we make use of what\nis today known as an \u201cinterpolant\u201d, \\(\\theta\\), a kind of\nsyllogism middle term that finally disappears.\n\nThe theorem cannot be established for many-sorted logic by simply\ntranslating \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) to the corresponding formulas of\na one-sorted language. It is easy to see that the logical form of a\nconstructed interpolant for \\(\\vdash \\Trans(\\varphi )\\rightarrow\n\\Trans(\\psi )\\) is not necessarily equivalent to a translation of a\nmany-sorted formula. This is why we said that this result could not be\nstraightforwardly transferred from the one-sorted case (see Otto 2000\nfor more details).\n\nAs in one-sorted logic, the interpolation lemma for a many-sorted\nlogic can be proven in model-theoretic style (as in Kreisel &\nKrivine 1967) or in proof-theoretical style, as in\n Feferman.[32]\n\nFeferman\u2019s proof of interpolation is obtained directly as a\ncorollary of one of his theorems for sequents (see Feferman 1968:\n56\u201362; Theorem 4.3) and its applications are model-theoretical,\nwhat reveals again the peculiar centrality of interpolation.\n",
