    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cMedieval philosophy\u201d has changed its meaning among\nspecialists over the last twenty years. The change is not in\nchronology, where views remain divided (see\n \u00a75):\n most agree that the period stretches at least from 500\u20131500,\nbut some push the starting point back and/or the end point\nforward.\n\nRather, the change is about geography, and so language and culture. In\nthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries, medieval philosophy was\nregarded as having taken place in Western Europe, mostly in Latin,\nwith Paris and Oxford as its greatest centres. Islamic and Jewish\nthinkers writing in Arabic were included only in so far as their works\nwere translated into Latin and influenced Christian thinkers.\nNowadays, however, \u201cmedieval philosophy\u201d is coming to be\nregarded as including not just the work of Christians writing in Latin\n(and sometimes in the European vernaculars), but of Christians in the\nByzantine Empire writing in Greek, Muslims (and some Christians)\nwriting in Arabic, and Jews in the Islamicate world writing in Arabic\nand in Christendom writing in\n Hebrew.[1]\n\nAlthough coverage of the different strands remains uneven, with Latin\nphilosophy still most studied, work on Arabic philosophy increasing\nrapidly and the other areas still somewhat neglected, it is now widely\nrecognized that medieval philosophizing in these different languages\nand countries should (though with some qualification) be seen as\nbranches of a single tradition, going back to Greek antiquity and\ngiven coherence by a series of translation movements between the\ndifferent languages. That is why this tradition (if it is called the\n\u201cWestern\u201d tradition, \u201cWestern\u201d must be\nunderstood much more broadly than usual) should be treated separately\nfrom the great achievements of philosophy from the same period in\nIndia, China, and\n elsewhere.[2]\n\nThis entry begins with a section on the ingredients of medieval\nphilosophy. It explains how medieval philosophy was based especially\non texts and their commentary, and looks at how these texts were\ntransmitted to the four branches of the medieval tradition and between\nthem. The next section looks at the different styles of philosophizing\nin the period, and the following section focuses on three problems\nthat highlight some of the special concerns of medieval philosophy,\nhow religious concerns interact with reasoning and the differences\nbetween the four branches. The penultimate section is devoted to logic\nand its unusual importance during the period, and the last section\ndiscusses the chronological bounds of medieval philosophy.\n",
