    "main_text": "Intention and Specification || Specifications and Functions\n2.3 Specifications and Functions\n\nFully implemented and constructed computational systems are\ntechnical artifacts, i.e., human-made systems designed and\nimplemented with the explicit aim of fulfilling specific functions\n(Kroes 2012). Technical artifacts so defined include tables,\nscrewdrivers, cars, bridges, or televisions, and they are distinct\nboth from natural objects (e.g. rocks, cats, or dihydrogen monoxide\nmolecules), which are not human-made, and artworks, which do not\nfulfill functions. As such, the ontology of computational systems\nfalls under that of technical artifacts (Meijers 2000) characterized\nby a duality, as they are defined by both functional\nand structural properties (Kroes 2009, see also the entry on\n philosophy of technology).\n Functional properties specify the functions the artifact is required\nto perform; structural properties express the physical properties\nthrough which the artifact can perform them. Consider a screwdriver:\nfunctional properties may include the function of screwing and\nunscrewing; structural properties can refer to a piece of metal\ncapable of being inserted on the head of the screw and a plastic\nhandle that allows a clockwise and anticlockwise motion. Functions can\nbe realized in multiple ways by their structural counterparts. For\ninstance, the function for the screwdriver could well be realized by a\nfull metal screwdriver, or by an electric screwdriver defined by very\ndifferent structural properties.\n\nThe layered ontology of computational systems characterized by many\ndifferent LoAs seems to extend the dual ontology defining technical\nartifacts (Floridi et al. 2015). Turner (2018) argues that\ncomputational systems are still artifacts in the sense of (Kroes 2009,\n2012), as each LoA is a functional level for lower LoAs and a\nstructural level for upper LoAs:\n\nthe intention expresses the functions that the system must achieve\nand is implemented by the specification;\nthe specification plays a functional role, explaining in details\nthe concrete functions that the software must implement, and it is\nrealized by an algorithm, its structural level;\u00a0\nthe algorithm expresses the procedures that the high-level\nlanguage program, its structural level, must implement;\ninstructions in high level language define the functional\nproperties for the machine language code, which realizes them;\nmachine code, finally, expresses the functional properties\nimplemented by the execution level, which expresses physical\nstructural properties.\n\n\nIt follows, according to Turner (2018), that structural levels need\nnot be necessarily physical levels, and that the notion of abstract\nartifact holds in computer science. For this reason, Turner (2011)\ncomes to define high-level language programs themselves as technical\nartifacts, in that they constitute a structural level implementing\nspecifications as their functional level\n (see\u00a0\u00a74.2).\n\nA first consequence is that each LoA \u2013\u00a0expressing\nwhat function to accomplish \u2013\u00a0can be realized by a\nmultiplicity of potential structural levels expressing how\nthose functions are accomplished: an intended functionality can be\nrealized by a specification in multiple ways; a computational problem\nexpressed by a specification has solutions by a multiplicity of\ndifferent algorithms, which can differ for some important properties\nbut are all equally valid (see\n \u00a73);\n an algorithm may be implemented in different programs, each written\nin a different high-level programming language, all expressing the\nsame program if they implement the same algorithm (Angius and\nPrimiero 2019); source code can be compiled in a multiplicity of\nmachine languages, adopting different ISAs (Instruction Set\nArchitectures); executable code can be installed and run on a\nmultiplicity of machines (provided that these share the same ISA).\n\nA second consequence is that each LoA as a functional level provides\ncorrectness criteria for lower levels (Primiero 2020). Not just at the\nimplementation level, correctness is required at any LoA from\nspecification to execution, and the cause of malfunctions may be\nlocated at any LoA not correctly implementing its proper functional\nlevel (see\n \u00a77.3\u00a0and\n Fresco, Primiero (2013)). According to Turner (2018), the\nspecification level can be said to be correct or incorrect with\nrespect to intentions, despite the difficulty of verifying their\ncorrectness. Correctness of any non-physical layer can be verified\nmathematically through formal verification, and the execution physical\nlevel can be verified empirically, through testing\n (\u00a76).\n Verifying correctness of specifications with respect to\nclients\u2019 intentions would require instead having access to the\nmental states of the involved agents.\n\nThis latter problem relates to the more general one of establishing\nhow artifacts possess functions, and what it means that structural\nproperties are related to the intentions of agents. The problem is\nwell-known also in the philosophy of biology and the cognitive\nsciences, and two main theories have been put forward as solutions.\nAccording to the causal theory of function (Cummins 1975),\nfunctions are determined by the physical capacities of artifacts: for\nexample, the physical ability of the heart of contracting and\nexpanding determines its function of pumping blood in the circulatory\nsystem. However, this theory faces serious problems when applied to\ntechnical artifacts. First, it prevents defining correctness and\nmalfunctioning (Kroes 2010): suppose the call filtering app installed\non our smartphone starts banning calls from contacts in our mobile\nphonebook; according to the causal theory of function this would be a\nnew function of the app. Second, the theory does not distinguish\nintended functions from side effects (Turner 2011): in case of a\nlong-lasting call, our smartphone would certainly start heating;\nhowever, this is not a function intended by clients or developers.\nAccording to the intentional theory of function (McLaughlin\n2001, Searle 1995), the function fixed by the designer or the user is\nthe intended one of the artifact, and structural properties of\nartifacts are selected so as to be able to fulfill it. This theory is\nable to explain correctness and malfunction, as well as to distinguish\nside effects from intended functions. However, it does not say where\nthe function actually resides, whether in the artifact or in the mind\nof the agent. In the former case, one is back at the question of how\nartifacts possess functions. In the latter case, a further explanation\nis needed about how mental states are related to physical properties\nof artifacts (Kroes 2010). Turner (2018) holds that the intuitions\nbehind both the causal and the intentional theories of function are\nuseful to understand the relation between function and structure in\ncomputational systems, and suggests that the two theories be combined\ninto a single one. On the one hand, there is no function without\nimplementation; on the other hand, there is no intention without\nclients, developers, and users.\n",
