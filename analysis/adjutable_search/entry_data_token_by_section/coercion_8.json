    "main_text": "Contemporary philosophical accounts of coercion || Coercive Offers?\n2.4 Coercive Offers?\n\nWhile the dominant strand in recent theory has associated coercion\nwith threats, and denied that offers can be used to coerce, this sharp\ndifferentiation of these two sorts of proposals has come in for some\ncriticism. The parallel structure of conditional threats and\nconditional offers has led some to deny that there is a deep\ndistinction to be made between them. Others have focused on the role\nof both in the broader political and economic context, and found that\nthese broader conditions make coercive offers a live possibility.\nDealings in capitalist markets are often highly exploitative;\ngovernments often condition the provision of ordinary benefits on the\nsatisfaction of unrelated demands (such as making highway funding\nconditional on states\u2019 passing particular laws). Given the\npotency such offers possess, one might suspect that there are many\noffers that one cannot reasonably refuse, possibly reflecting great\nimbalances in power or prior historical injustices between the\nbargaining parties. (See, for instance, O\u2019Neill 1991; and Berman\n2001.)\n\nOf those who have argued that threats and offers can both be used\ncoercively, David Zimmerman has been most prominent (Zimmerman 1981;\nothers who have argued offers can coerce include Frankfurt 1988\n[1973]; Held 1972; Lyons 1975; Van De Veer 1979; Benditt 1979;\nFeinberg 1986; Stevens 1988; Rocha 2011; for criticism of Zimmerman,\nHeld, and Stevens, see Alexander 1981; Bayles 1974; and Swanton 1989,\nrespectively). Retaining the baseline-approach to coercion found in\nNozick, Zimmerman urges that in setting a baseline for judging a\nproposal, we should take into account the possibility that the\nproposal maker is actively hindering the coercee from obtaining a\nsituation for herself that would be better than the situation the\ncoercer proposes. So, for instance, if a person is destitute on an\nisland, and someone proposes to employ this person for a\nlife-sustaining pittance, this proposal may count as an offer, since\nit is an improvement over the \u201cpre-proposal\u201d situation.\nBut if the person is destitute and unable to obtain better conditions\nonly because the employer actively prevents the person from leaving\nthe island (say, by preventing the building of boats), Zimmerman\nsuggests the offer should be regarded as coercive. That\u2019s\nbecause the appropriate baseline for evaluating the proposal is the\nstate of affairs that the recipient would face in the absence of\nspecial interference by the proposal maker. (In the present case, this\nmight be the situation the island inhabitant would face were she able\nto build a boat and return to the mainland.) If relative to this\nbaseline the offer is less favored, then it should count as coercive,\nZimmerman thinks.\n\nDo such offers coerce? The dispute between those who say offers can\ncoerce, such as Zimmerman, and those who insist only threats coerce\nmay be more verbal than substantive. While Zimmerman, for instance,\nwould label the offer itself coercive, what appears to do the coercing\nhere is whatever means were or are being used to keep the recipient of\nthe offer from reaching a better bargaining state. If the offering\nparty here has created the conditions that make even very unattractive\noffers still the best available, then the coercion, if there is any,\nseems to be vested in the offerer\u2019s actions that prevent the\nrecipient from improving her situation or finding better offers\nelsewhere.\n\nZimmerman grants that even if the offering party does not cause the\nrecipient to be in the position she\u2019s in, we may still want to\ncriticize such offers. In these cases, the offer-maker may be guilty\nof engaging in exploitation, though not coercion. When one\nparty is in a much stronger bargaining position than another, the\nstronger party sometimes uses its advantage to keep for itself most or\nall of the gains to be had from cooperative interaction between the\nparties. So employers who are in a stronger bargaining position than\ntheir employees may exploit them by paying them a small fraction of\nthe value their labor contributes to the production of goods for the\nemployer. This is especially feasible when one party has a relative\nmonopoly position with respect to some valuable good (say, employment\nopportunities). So, reconfiguring Zimmerman\u2019s results somewhat,\nwe might retain the exclusive connection between threats and coercion\nby saying that offers made from a position of superior bargaining\nstrength are very likely to be exploitative; and that sometimes\ncoercion is used to create or maintain one\u2019s bargaining\nadvantages.\n\nNot all, however, would accept that the coerciveness of a large\ndifferential in bargaining power depends upon its causal origins. Joan\nMcGregor, for example, gives an analysis of such offers in an account\nthat eschews the baseline approach. She argues, \u201cthe\n\u2018better off\u2019/\u2018worse off\u2019 distinction ignores\nthe power relationships that occur when there are radically disparate\nbargaining strengths\u201d (McGregor 1988\u201389, 24). To assess\nthe coerciveness of something like an economic transaction, one must\ninstead attend to the relative strengths of the bargaining positions\nbetween parties involved. \u201c[C]oercion involves exercising power\nover another; in the market, it involves exercising superior\nbargaining power\u201d (McGregor 1988\u201389, 25). At least two of\nthe conditions for having bargaining power sufficient to coerce\nanother are that the weaker party is dependent in some way on\nthe stronger party (e.g., there are no other options or potential\nexchange partners), and the stronger party has influence over whether\nsome significant evil occurs to the weaker party (such as\nloss of life, health, security) (McGregor 1988\u201389, 34). If in\naddition the stronger party decides to take advantage of these\nconditions, then this is not just exploitation but coercion. While the\ndetails of her account of bargaining strength may raise difficulties,\nher attempt to incorporate a measure of the coercer\u2019s power into\nthe account of coercion seems a useful if relatively under-explored\napproach. Arguably, a consideration such as this motivates Serena\nOlsaretti in her argument that markets might preserve freedom while\nalso undermining voluntariness in a fashion similar to that of\ncoercive threats (Olsaretti 2004, ch. 6).\n",
