    "main_text": "Contemporary Relevance || Comparative and Environmental Philosophy\n7.5 Comparative and Environmental Philosophy\n\nInterpreting existence in terms of the situated activity of\nbeing-in-the-world not only serves as a rejection of substance ontology\nand the metaphysical dualisms (subject-object; mind-body; inner-outer)\nthat we inherit from Cartesian and empiricist epistemologies; it also\nreveals deep affinities with the nonduality of Buddhism and other\nincarnations of Eastern thought. (Loy 2018; Kalmanson 2020) And the\nrecognition of our enmeshment in the world has informed a range of\nimportant advances in the philosophy of place, deep ecology, and\neco-phenomenology (Brown & Toadvine 2003; Malpas 2017; Morton 2016;\nRentmeester 2016). These endeavors have exposed the limitations of the\nscientific worldview and our uncritical dependence on technological\ninnovation to address the current ecological crisis. Modern science\ngenerally assumes a binary paradigm of the subject as separate and\ndistinct from a value-less domain of objects (or nature), a domain that\ncan, in turn, be mastered and controlled by technoscience. In this way,\nit betrays our ordinary experience, that in our day-to-day lives we are\nnot atomistic, self-certain subjects but beings that are fundamentally\nentwined with the world and the meaning and value that this\nintertwining brings to our experience. For the existentialist, then,\nextricating ourselves from environmental doom requires not a\ntechnoscientific fix but an ontological transformation in our own\nself-understanding, an awaking to the reality of our interdependence\nwith nature, that the earth is not apart from us but rather\npart of us. \n",
