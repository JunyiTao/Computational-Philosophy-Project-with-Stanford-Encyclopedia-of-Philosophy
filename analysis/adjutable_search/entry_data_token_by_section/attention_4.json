John Dashiell\u2019s 1928 Fundamentals of Objective\nPsychology, for example, is a behaviourist work that attempts to\naccount for attention \u201cas a form of posturing\u201d (Ch. 10,\n\u00a73). The project of identifying a behaviour with which to explain\nattention was, nonetheless, an understandably unpopular one. As\nGilbert Ryle notes, it is not only attention, but also \u2018heed\nconcepts\u2019 more generally, that resist simple behaviourist\nanalysis:\n\n[W]hen a man is described as driving carefully, whistling with\nconcentration or eating absent-mindedly the special character of his\nactivity seem to elude the observer, the camera and the Dictaphone.\nPerhaps knitted brows, taciturnity and fixed gaze may be evidence of\nintentness; but these can be simulated, or they can be purely\nhabitual. (1949, 133)\n\n\nIn the middle of the twentieth century behaviourism\u2019s dominance\nwaned, cognitive psychology established itself, and a new theoretical\napproach to the explanation of attention was developed. These three\ndevelopments were intimately related to one another. Instrumental to\nall three was the publication in 1958 of Donald Broadbent\u2019s\nPerception and Communication.\n\nThe year prior to Perception and Communication\u2019s\npublication had seen B.F. Skinner\u2019s attempt, in Verbal\nBehaviour (1957), to apply a behaviourist explanatory approach to\ndistinctively human aspects of cognition. Skinner\u2019s project in\nthat book failed, and Noam Chomsky\u2019s famous 1959 review of the\nbook made its failure conspicuous. Chomsky\u2019s own work in\nSyntactic Structures (1957) went some way towards\nestablishing the new cognitive paradigm for psychology by showing how\ninternal processing could be theorized by describing transformations\non representations in abstraction from the question of how those\nrepresentations were realized. Donald Broadbent\u2019s distinctive\ncontribution to the overthrow of behaviourism was to show how the move\nfrom behavioural data to the postulation of a particular cognitive\narchitecture could be disciplined by the then-new strategy of\nimporting into psychology the intellectual resources used in thinking\nabout information technology. The year in which Broadbent\u2019s book\nwas published was an important year for the development of such\ntechnologies, being the year in which (inter alia) the integrated\ncircuit chip was invented (see Mole, 2012). It was also the year in\nwhich Subscriber Trunk Dialling was introduced to UK telephone\nexchanges. The technology of the telephone exchange was what most\nnaturally suggested itself as a metaphor for attention at the time\nwhen Broadbent was writing.\n\nTowards the end of Perception and Communication Broadbent\nexplicitly sets out the claim that the theoretical resources developed\nin thinking about the transmission of information through telephone\nexchanges provide the basis for an alternative to behaviourism. He\nalso attacks the positivistic methodological principles that had given\nmany behaviourists their motivation. But the central lesson from\nBroadbent\u2019s work, so far as the theory of attention goes, is a\nlesson that he takes to be independent of this attack on behaviourism\nand its positivist foundations. At an early stage in Perception\nand Communication he remarks that:\n\nPerhaps the point of permanent value which will remain in psychology\nif the fashion for communication theory wanes, will be the emphasis on\nproblems of capacity. [\u2026] The fact that any given channel has a\nlimit is a matter of central importance to communication engineers,\nand it is correspondingly forced on the attention of psychologists who\nuse their terms. (1958, 5)\n\n\nThis introduction of the notion of capacity limitations into\ndiscussions of perception and attention was, as Broadbent here\npredicted, hugely and permanently influential.\n\nBroadbent claimed not only that the human brain is subject to capacity\nlimitations of the sort that communications engineers had learnt to\ntheorize, he claimed also that these limitations are clustered so that\nthere is a single bottleneck in capacity that is especially critical\nto the brain\u2019s handling of perceptual information. This\nbottleneck was said to occur at the junction of two systems operating\nin series, with the first system having a large capacity for\ninformation processing, and operating automatically on all of the\nstimuli with which the perceiving subject is presented, while the\nsecond has a much smaller capacity, and therefore needs to be deployed\nselectively.\n\nThose who followed Broadbent took it that the bottleneck that results\nfrom the connection of these two systems corresponds to attention in\nthe sense that, when a representation of a stimulus passes through\nthat bottleneck, the stimulus ipso facto counts as one to\nwhich attention has been paid.\n\nBroadbent himself was cautious about presenting his claims about\ncapacity-bottlenecks as a theory of attention. The word\n\u2018attention\u2019 occurs rarely in Perception and\nCommunication. Broadbent\u2019s later book, Decision and\nStress (1971), does describe his earlier experiments as\n\u2018studies of attention\u2019, but here too Broadbent prefers to\ntalk about \u2018selective perception\u2019 (chapter V) or\n\u2018vigilance\u2019 (chapters II and III). In an article from\n1982, entitled, \u2018Task Combination and Selective Intake of\nInformation\u2019, he admits that: \u201cThe topic of this paper is\none that is often termed \u2018attention\u2019, and it may seem\nunduly artificial to have given it a more cumbrous title.\u201d But\nhe goes on to reassert his qualms:\n\n\u2018Attention\u2019 is a word in ordinary language, that can\nreasonably be used as a label for experiments in a particular area.\nYet it has also been used as a theoretical concept, a mysterious asset\nor energy which is sometimes attached to human functions and sometimes\nnot. This use of attention [\u2026] is not very helpful, and\navoiding the word in the title is a step towards clarity. (1982, 253)\n\n\nWhen Broadbent does use the word \u2018attention\u2019 it is mostly\nin discussions of attention shifting. His view, at least in\nhis early work, seems to have been that where there is a bottleneck in\nour information processing capacity there need to be additional\nmechanisms that control how our limited capacity resources will be\ndeployed. These additional mechanisms of bottleneck-control\nseem to have been what Broadbent thought of as the attention\nmechanisms. He never took himself to have given a theory of them, only\nto have given a theory of where they would be needed. Nor were these\nmechanisms the topic that was at issue in the debates about attention\nthat Broadbent prompted. Those debates were concerned with questions\nabout the nature and location of the bottleneck itself, not about the\nfactors that determine what, on any particular occasion, gets to pass\nthrough it.\n\nIn the decades following Broadbent a great many psychologists devoted\nthemselves to the task of locating the attentional bottleneck that he\nhad postulated. Almost all psychologists writing at this time were\nguided to some degree by Broadbent\u2019s\ntwo-serial-systems-and-a-bottleneck picture of perceptual processing.\nThe question of whether a given task is attention demanding was\ntherefore understood to depend on the question of whether the\nperformance of that task requires the engagement of the small-capacity\nsystem that comes after the bottleneck of attention.\u00a0 Research\ninto the attention-related demands of particular tasks therefore\nbecame another route by which to approach the issue of where the\nattentional bottleneck is located. Broadbent\u2019s\ntwo-systems-and-a-bottleneck model was frequently questioned, but for\nmost research into attention in the second half of the twentieth\ncentury it was very much the orthodox view. This has now changed. In\npsychology\u2019s current paradigm, only a few aspects of\nBroadbent\u2019s picture remain orthodox.\n",
