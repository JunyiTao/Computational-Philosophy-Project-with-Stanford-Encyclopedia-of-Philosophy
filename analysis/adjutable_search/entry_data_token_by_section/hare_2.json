    "main_text": "The Logic of Imperatives\n3. The Logic of Imperatives\n\n\nHare\u2019s attempt to ground a logic of imperatives was innovative, but\nproblematic. One uncertainty is about its field. He supposes that\nthere is a genus of tellings to that extends over commands,\norders, instructions, givings of advice, and even\u2014when the\nimperative is self-addressed\u2014forming desires and\nintentions. These belong together in sharing a direction of\nfit or onus of match that contrasts them\nwith tellings that which convey information and express\nstates of belief or of knowledge. Crudely, if I tell you\nthat p, and p is false, then, if anything, it is my\nutterance that is out of order; if I tell you to do X, and you\ndon\u2019t do X, then, if anything, it is your action that is out of\norder. The general idea is that, just as, if I tell you\nthat p, I am implicitly telling you that q, if it is\ncommon knowledge between us that p entails q, so, if\nI tell you to do X, I am implicitly telling you to do Y,\nif we know that\u2014well, this is what has to be determined.\n\n\nIt is arguable that the notion of implicitly prescribing\nfails to determine any logic of imperatives (Price 2004b: \u00a74).\nLater papers of Hare\u2019s focused upon various problem cases.  I shall\nconsider three of these here, all of which admit possible solutions\neither proposed, or proposable, by Hare.\n\n(1) The simplest examples involve only imperative sentences. These may\ninvite the simple thought that one imperative entails another if the\nfirst cannot be satisfied without the second being satisfied also\n(Hare identifies this as a \u201clogic of satisfaction\u201d, 1971a:\n63). This may seem plausible in the following case:\n\n\n(A)\nDo X and Y. So, do X.\n\n\n\nLess plausible, however, may appear to be this:\n\n\n(B) Do X.\nSo, do X or Y.\n\n(Hare discusses the following instance, \u201cPost the letter; so\npost the letter or burn it\u201d, 1967: 25\u201334). And yet it is\nequally true with (B) as with (A) that the premise cannot be satisfied\nwithout the conclusion being satisfied. Moreover, (B) can be derived\nfrom (A) by contraposition and substitution. If (A) is valid, so\nshould (C) be:\n\n\n(C)\n Don\u2019t do X.\nSo, don\u2019t (do X and Y).\nSo, do not X or not Y.\n\n\nThen we have only to replace \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d by \u201cdo\u201d,\nand we have (B).\n\n\nWilliams (1962/3) judged (B) to be invalid, on the ground that its\nconclusion carried a \u201cpermissive presupposition\u201d that the\nhearer may do X or do Y. Hare defended it on the ground\nthat the permission is a conversational implicature that is cancelled\nin the context defined by the premise\n\u201cDo X\u201d. However, even (A) may be less plausible\nthan it looks. Take this example (which comes from Bob Hale):\n\n(D)\n Light the fuse and step back three paces.\nSo, light the fuse.\n\n\n\nIt is certainly true that the conclusion reiterates part of\nwhat was prescribed in the premise. And yet I may hesitate to tell\nsomeone to light the fuse, even when I am happy to tell him to light\nthe fuse and step back, if I know that, given his tendency to be\ncarried away, he is most likely, if he lights the fuse, not\nto remember to step back. (As we might put the point in terms of\npossible worlds, I won\u2019t tell him to light the fuse if the closest\nworld to this one in which he lights the fuse is one where he forgets\nto step back; indeed, one solution is to require, for the inference to\ngo through, the addition of a factual premise to the effect that if he\nlights the fuse, he will remember to step back.) And how can\nI be telling someone implicitly to do a thing that I would be\nunwilling to tell him to do explicitly?\n\n\nAgain, however, Hare would presumably say that any suggestion,\nimplicit in the entailed \u201cLight the fuse\u201d, that the hearer\nshould focus upon lighting the fuse is corrected in context by the\ninitial instruction that he then step back.\n\n\n(2) New problems arise when we have mixed inferences, involving\nindicative as well as imperative premises. The simplest way of\nextending a logic of satisfaction to these is by the following rule: a\nset of premises entails a conclusion if the premises cannot be true\n(if indicative) or satisfied (if imperative) without the conclusion\nbeing true or satisfied also. However, we also need restrictive rules\nof which an example (already stated in 1952: 28) would be that no\nimperative conclusion can be drawn from purely indicative\npremises\u2014but that is doubtless too simple. Take an example from\nAristotle\u2019s De Motu Animalium (7, 701a19\u201322). It\ninvolves reasoning from one intention to another. Given Hare\u2019s\nwillingness to represent intentions as self-addressed imperatives, we\ncan rewrite it as follows:\n\n(E)\n Let me make a cloak.\nIf I make a cloak, I must do such-and-such.\nSo, let me do such-and-such.\n\n\n\nHere, if the second premise is true, the first premise cannot be\nsatisfied without the conclusion\u2019s being satisfied also; so the\ninference goes through on a logic of satisfaction.\n\n\nNow this evidently needs to be restricted. Take the following:\n\n(F)\n Let me get drunk.\nWhoever gets drunk is bound to have a hangover.\nSo, let me have a hangover.\n\n\nIt is true that, if I advise someone \u201cGet drunk\u201d, he might\nrespond \u201cAre you telling me to have a hangover?\u201d Yet this\ninference is not acceptable as leading from one intention to another;\nfor predicted side-effects of realizing one\u2019s intentions are not\nthereby intended, even if (in another case) they are\nwelcome. Inferences that may take one from one intention to another\nneed rather to relate, as Aristotle intended (E) (though its wording is actually ambiguous), to means towards, or ways of,\nachieving a given goal.\n\n\nYet further problems arise. Suppose that I intend to achieve some\nunforgettable end, and recognize that it will require, in due course,\na presently forgettable means. (Suppose that I am already set on\nmaking a cloak, an end which already looms large in my mind; but some\nsubsidiary means that I know to be necessary in due course can only\nbecome salient when the time approaches\u2014I cannot now form an\nintention to realize the means since I know that I would at once\nforget it until my intention to realize the end reminded me of them at\nan opportune moment.) I then already intend the end,\nbut cannot as yet seriously intend the means; for it is\nplausibly part of having a present intention to do something that one\nexpects one\u2019s intention to play a role in a causal sequence\nculminating in one\u2019s doing it.\n\n\nWhat would Hare say to all this? He can reply that while a\nself-addressed imperative may express an intention, it can also fail\nto do so, and that this puts no limits on a logic of prescriptions. If\nI tell someone to get drunk, knowing that this will produce a\nhangover, I am telling him to have a hangover, even\nwithout intending this. Further, it was already a condition\non a prescription\u2019s expressing an intention that its realization\nappears to the subject to be practicable; it can now be added that I\ncan only form an intention now if I expect it to contribute to the\nsatisfaction of the prescription. This then becomes a refinement, and\nnot an objection.\n\n\n(3) A problem that we all face is how to reconcile the following two\nconditional imperatives. (I take my example from Price 2008: 60; but\nit is of a kind that Hare was long conscious of, and discusses in Hare\n1968.)\n\n(a)\nIf you want to get drunk every evening,\n you should work in a bar.\n(b)\nIf you want to get drunk every evening,\n you shouldn\u2019t work in a bar.\n\n\n\nThese look contradictory, but need not be in any way inconsistent: (a)\nmay be true in that working in a bar is the only way through which you\ncan manage to get drunk every evening; (b) may be true in that, given\nthat you are a potential alcoholic with a weak will, not working in a\nbar is a necessary condition of your maintaining your health (which\nyou either are much concerned about, or ought to\nbe). We can distinguish (a) and (b) most clearly by asking how to\ndetach the consequent. This seems straightforward in the case of (b):\none can detach \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t work in a bar\u201d from (b) by\nasserting \u201cYou (do) want to get drunk every evening\u201d. But\nhow, if at all, can we detach the consequent of (a)?\n \n\n\nOne answer might be that one can\u2019t. Another might be that one can, and by asserting \u201cYou (do) want to get drunk every evening\u201d, but \nonly by deriving the consequent \u201cYou should work in a bar\u201d\nin a heavily qualified and contextualized sense: working in a bar\nmay fit getting drunk every evening as a necessary means;\nhence one might say \u201cYou should work in bar\u201d, but only if\nit is implicit that the fittingness that \u201cshould\u201d connotes\nexists only in relation to the goal in question. (So, of\ncourse, no recommendation of working in a bar follows.)\nHare, however, permits himself a bold solution. He takes the clause\n\u201cyou want to get drunk every evening\u201d to be have different\nmeanings in (a) and (b). In (b), it is an embedded indicative,\nascribing a desire to you\u2014which is why the consequent can be\ndetached by asserting \u201cYou want to get drunk every\nevening\u201d. In (a), it is an embedded imperative, which would\nserve on its own for advising you to get drunk every evening;\ntherefore the consequent can be detached, but only\nby prescribing \u201cGet drunk every evening\u201d.\n\n\nThe logic is then essentially the same as that of (E) above (but with a disambiguation of its second premise):\n\n\nGet drunk every evening.  To get drunk every evening, you must\nwork in a bar.  So, work in a bar.\n\n\n\nThis then invites rewriting, by what Hare takes to be an analogue of a licit logical manoeuvre, as\nfollows:\n\n\nTo get drunk every evening, you must work in a bar.  So, if get\ndrunk every evening, work in a bar.\n\n\n\nHowever, since grammar excludes following \u201cif\u201d by an\nimperative, it is replaced in the antecedent by a special use of\n\u201cyou want\u201d.\n\n\nThis might be thought no less problematic than convenient for Hare:\ndoesn\u2019t it break the simple\u2014if too simple\u2014rule that no\nimperative conclusion can be derived from premises that contain no\nimperative? However, that simple rule lacks application here; for the\noperator with widest scope in the conclusion is \u201cif\u201d, and\nnot an imperative.\n\n\nOf course, this proposal by Hare makes salient what has always been\nthe gravest objection to a prescriptivist analysis of practical\n\u201cought\u201ds (and \u201cmust\u201ds): moral judgments cannot\nentail imperatives; for the content of a moral judgment can occur,\nwhereas an imperative cannot occur, embedded in various\ncontexts, such as an \u201cif\u201d-clause (forming a conditional\nantecedent), or a \u201cthat\u201d-clause (giving the content of a\nbelief or assertion). The objection was made strongly by Peter Geach\nin an article (1965) citing Gottlob Frege; so it has come to be known\nas the \u201cFrege-Geach\u201d objection.  Hare\u2019s response is to be\nfound in Hare (1970). His solution to the problem as it arises with\nconditionals derives from Gilbert Ryle\u2019s notion of \u201cinference\ntickets\u201d (1950). The role of the quasi-English \u201cIf get\ndrunk every evening, work in a bar\u201d is to yield an implicit\nprescription to work in a bar out of any prescription to get drunk\nevery evening. To press the utterer of (a) on what he is\nhypothesizing, and what might make it true, is therefore out of\nplace. What looks like a truth-apt proposition with a complex\nstructure is really playing a quite different role: it is not a\nproposition, but a kind of rule.\n\n\nHare (1989c) further hoped to reduce the paradox of an embedded\nimperative by making a distinction between two elements within the\nexpression of a speech act: when a speaker says\n\u201cDo X\u201d, thereby telling a hearer to do X, he\nboth issues a sentence in the imperative mood, fit for the\ncommunication of a command, and indicates that he intends so to be\nusing it. He calls a sign of the first a tropic, or sign of\nmood; this is to be distinguished from a neustic, or sign of\nsubscription (like Frege\u2019s assertion-sign). When\n\u201cDo X\u201d is embedded within a conditional antecedent,\nas can be expressed in English by \u201cIf you want to\ndo X\u201d, the tropic remains though the neustic disappears.\nThis is why it is the imperative \u201cDo X\u201d, and not\nthe indicative \u201cYou are about to do X\u201d, that\nreleases the consequent.\n\n\nMany attempts have been made since to solve what is essentially the\nsame problem, which arises with any view of moral judgments that\ndenies that they are truth\u2013apt in the substantive sense of\ndescribing things, or presenting possible contents of belief about the\nway things are. Indeed, the topic has come fully to life again during\nthe past ten years or so. Of recent treatments, that which owes the\nmost to Hare, both actually and explicitly, is that of John Eriksson\n(2009); cf. also Eriksson (2015), and for discussion Eggers\n(2016). Take the following example (which is more straightforward than\nEriksson\u2019s):\n\nIt would be bad of you to lie to me.\nIf it would be bad of you to lie to me, it would be bad of me to\nlie to you. Therefore,\nIt would be bad of me to lie to you.\n\n\n\nWe may call the speaker \u201cS\u201d, and the addressee\n\u201cA\u201d. Eriksson\u2019s proposal is that the validity of\nthe reasoning depends upon the descriptive meaning of\n\u201cbad\u201d (one that it has in general, or, more likely, one\nthat it takes on in this context). Suppose that S\njudges A\u2019s lying to him to be bad. This must be because, in\nhis view, it has some general bad\u2013making characteristic (or set\nof characteristics) B*; this lies behind Premise 1. Then, in\na simple case (which should suffice for making the present point),\nwhat lies behind Premise 2. will be the equal but conditional\nascription of B* to A\u2019s lying to him. Premise\n1. becomes the antecedent that discharges the consequent of Premise\n2., and we have the conclusion stated in 3.\n\n\nHare was aware that such an inference goes through unproblematically\n(and uninterestingly) once we limit ourselves to the descriptive\nmeaning of \u201cbad\u201d that is spelled out in B*; but,\nof course, we want to have an inference to a prescriptive, and not\njust a descriptive, conclusion. Eriksson now draws on a point that is\nalready recurrent in Hare: in virtue of universalizability, S\nfaces a problem if he wishes to mean 1. prescriptively while refusing\nto mean 3. prescriptively. If he is to forbid A\u2019s lying to\nhim, but not his lying to A, he will need to identify some\nrelevant alternative to B* that fits A\u2019s lying to\nhim, but not his lying to A; this is where descriptive\nmeaning becomes crucial. What here defines \u201crelevance\u201d? A\nmere difference of identity between S and A is\nexcluded from counting as relevant by universalizability. Yet no\ndoubt S is also distinguishable from A by various\ngeneral features, and any of these might serve to make a permissible\ndistinction between the two cases. Here we need to appeal to the full\nforce of the Golden Rule Argument that we shall come to in the next\nsection: what is likely to exclude the speaker from making some\nartificial distinction that permits him to lie to A, but\nnot A to lie to him, will be his inability sincerely and\nprudently to select his prescriptions in accordance with it.\n \n\nThere can be no doubt that Hare would have welcomed this solution. Two\nobvious objections to it arise from problems that anyway attach to his\nconception of \u201cdescriptive meaning\u201d:\n\nS may have only a vague notion of the content of B*.\nEven if S has a clear (or sufficiently clear) notion of\nB*, A may well have a different notion himself,\nand/or no clear understanding of S\u2019s notion.\n\n\nEvidently, Hare needed to give further thought, within a philosophy of\nthought and language, to what must be a concept of speaker\u2019s\nmeaning. (At reading parties and in informal discussion, he took a\nkeen interest in the work of H.P. Grice; yet, perhaps out of an\nawareness of its complications, he never engaged with it in print, or\nin this connection.) A local reply, which keeps away from any such\ngeneral philosophy, must have to be on the lines of the\nfollowing. Evidently, it wasn\u2019t material to the validity of the\ninference as I presented it how we choose to\nspecify B*. Hence S and A can share a grasp\nof the validity of the inference even if they both lack, or fail to\nshare, any suitable conception of B*. All that Eriksson\noffers, and that I have presented, is a schematic grounding of the\ninference; and, for the reasons given, we can grasp, before we are\nable to spell out the details in a way that can reliably\nunderpin S and A\u2019s reasoning together to an ethical\nconclusion, how the schema confirms the validity of the inference. And\none real possibility that may ease the situation is this: S\nand A may agree that there is no relevant general\ncharacteristic that distinguishes S\u2019s lying to A\nfrom A\u2019s lying to S, though they disagree \u2013 or\nare each unclear \u2013 about what characteristic makes both\nwrong.\n\nDiscussion has focused upon the special problems that arise over\nembeddings within the antecedents of conditionals. With the occurrence\nof moral predicates within indirect speech Hare faced separate\ndifficulties, and ones to which he offers no explicit\nsolution. However, if there is to be any hope of a solution, he\nmay need, in this case, to exploit his notion of descriptive\nmeaning. Take as an example, \u201cS believes that lying is\nwrong\u201d, or alternatively (and indifferently) \u201cS\nholds lying to be wrong.\u201d A direct analysis of what he believes\nin believing this is hardly going to be available. Yet one may be able\nto specify, taking Hare\u2019s analysis of \u201cLying is wrong\u201d as\na hypothesis, what has to be true if S is to count as\nbelieving that lying is wrong. S needs to have a conception\nof some feature that characterizes lying in virtue of which, once he\nis prescribing universally, he forbids it. (Or else, S may be\nunable to say what it is about lying that makes it wrong to lie, yet\nwithout doubting that lying has some feature that does this.) What\nthen gives intelligibility and determinacy to the content of his\n\u201cbelief\u201d is not a set of truth-conditions, but an act of\nwill that rests upon a factual basis, and does not simply reiterate\nwhat his nanny has taught him to will. He holds what is\nstraightforwardly a factual belief about lying (though he may be\nvariably able to articulate it), and forbids lying in the light of\nthat.\n\n\n",
