    "main_text": "Sakya\n3. Sakya\n\nSakya\u2019s theory of two truths is defended in the works of the\nsuccession of Sakya scholars\u2014Sakya Pa\u1e45\u1e0dita\n(1182\u20131251), Rongt\u00f6n Shakya Gyaltsen (Rong ston\n\u015a\u0101kya rgyal tshan, 1367\u20131449), the translator Taktsang\nLotsawa (Stag tsang Lo ts\u0101 ba, 1405\u2013?), Gorampa Sonam Senge\n(Go rams pa Bsod nams seng ge, 1429\u201389) and Shakya Chogden\n(\u015a\u0101kya Mchog ldan, 1428\u20131509). In particular Gorampa\nSonam Senge\u2019s works are unanimously recognised as the authoritative\nrepresentation of the Sakya\u2019s position. Sakya agree with Nyingma and\nKagy\u00fc in maintaining that the distinction between the two truths\nis merely subjective processes, and that the two truths are reducible\nto the two conflicting perspectives (Sakya Pa\u1e45\u1e0dita 1968a:\n72d, Rongt\u00f6n Shakya Gyaltsen n.d. 7f, Taktsang Lotsawa n.d.: 27,\nShakya Chogden 1975a: 3\u20134ff, 15f). \u201cAlthough there\nare not two truths in terms of the object\u2019s ontological mode of being\n(gnas tshul), the truths are divided into two in terms of\n[the contrasting perspectives of] the mind that sees the mode of\nexistence and the mind that does not see the mode of\nexistence\u2026This makes perfect sense\u201d (Gorampa 1969a:\n374ab). Since it emphasizes the subjective nature of the distinction\nbetween the two truths, it proposes \u201cmere mind\u201d (blo\ntsam) to be the basis of the division (Gorampa 1969a: 374ab). It\naruges that \u201cHere in the Madhyamaka system, the object itself\ncannot be divided into two truths. Conventional truth and ultimate\ntruth are divided in terms of the modes of apprehension (mthong\ntshul)\u2014in terms of the subject apprehending unreality and\nthe subject apprehending reality; or in terms of mistaken and\nunmistaken apprehensions (\u2018khrul ma \u2018khrul); or\ndeluded or undeluded apprehensions (rmongs ma rmongs); or\nerroneous or nonerroneous apprehensions (phyin ci log ma\nlog); or reliable cognition or unreliable cognitions (tshad\nma yin min)\u201d (Gorampa 1969a: 375b). He also adds that:\n\u201cThe position which maintains that the truths are divided in\nterms of the subjective consciousness is one that all\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gikas and Sv\u0101tantrikas of India unanimously\naccepted because they are posited in terms of the subjective cognitive\nprocesses depending on whether it is deluded (rmongs) or\nnondeluded (ma rmongs), a perception of unreality (brdzun\npa thong ba) or a perception of reality (yang dag mthong\nba), and mistaken (khrul) or incontrovertible (ma\nkhrul) (1969a: 384c).\n\nSakya\u2019s advances two reasons to support its position. First, since the\nminds of ordinary beings are always deluded, mistaken, and erroneous,\nthey falsely experience conventional truth. Conventional truth is thus\nposited only in relation to the perspective of the ordinary\n beings.[2]\n The wisdom of exalted meditative equipoise is however never mistaken,\nit is always nondeluded, and nonerroneous, hence exalted beings\nflawlessly experience ultimate truth. Ultimate truth is thus posited\nstrictly in relation to the cognitive perspective of exalted beings.\nSecond, the view held by Sakya argues for separate cognitive agents\ncorresponding to each of the two truths. Ordinary beings have direct\nknowledge of conventional truth, but are utterly incapable of knowing\nultimate truth. The exalted beings in training have direct knowledge\nof the ultimate in their meditative equipoise and direct knowledge of\nthe conventional truth in the post meditative states. Fully awakened\nbuddhas, on the other hand, only have access to ultimate truth. They\nhave no access to conventional truth whatsoever from the\nenlightened perspective, although they may access\nconventional truth from the perspective of ordinary deluded\nbeings.\n\nEtymologically Sakya characterizes ultimate (parama) as a\nqualification of transcendent exalted cognitive process\n(\u2018jig rten las \u2018das pa'i ye shes,\nlokottaraj\u00f1\u0101na) that belongs to exalted beings with\nartha as its corresponding object. The sense of ultimate\ntruth (param\u0101rthasatya) grants primacy to the exalted\ntranscendent cognitive process of the noble beings, which supersedes\nthe ontological status of conventional phenomena (Gorampa 1969a:\n377d). \u201cThere is no realization and realized object, nor is there\nobject and subject\u201d (Gorampa 1969b: 714f, 727\u2013729). As\nTaktsang Lotsawa puts it: \u201cA wisdom without dual appearance is\nwithout any object\u201d (Taktsang n.d.: 305f). Strictly speaking,\ntranscendent wisdom itself becomes the ultimate truth. \u201cUltimate\ntruth is to be experienced under a total cessation of dualistic\nappearance through exalted personal wisdom,\u201d and further,\n\u201cAnything that has dualistic appearance, even omniscience,must\nnot be treated as ultimate truth\u201d (Gorampa 1969b:\n612\u201313ff).\n\nTherefore conventionality (sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti, kun rdzob) means\nprimal ignorance (Gorampa, 1969b: 377b, Sakya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita\n1968a: 72b, Shakya Chogden 1975a: 30f, Rongt\u00f6n Shakya Gyaltsen\n1995: 288). In agreement with Nyingma and Kagy\u00fc, Sakya treats\nprimal ignorance as to the villain responsible for projecting the entire\nsystem of conventional truths. It argues ignorance as constituting the\ndefining characteristics of the conventional\n truth.[3]\n (Sakya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita 1968a: 72, Rendawa 1995: 121, Shakya\nChogden 1975b: 378f, 1975c: 220, Taktsang Lotsawa n.d.: 27f,\nRongt\u00f6n Shakya Gyaltsen 1995: 287, n.d: 6\u20137ff) It\nformulates the definitions of the two truths in terms of the\ndistinctions between the ignorant experiences of ordinary beings and\nthe enlightened experiences of noble beings during their meditative\nequipoise. Sakya\u2019s definition is based on three reasons. First, each\nconventionally real phenomenon satisfies only the definition of\nconventional truth because each phenomenon has only a conventional\nnature (in contrast to the two nature theory of Gelug), and that\nultimate truth has a transcendent ontological status. Second, that\neach cognitive agent is potentially capable of knowing only one truth\nexhaustively, being equipped with either the requisite conventionally\nreliable cognitive process or ultimately reliable cognitive process.\nEach truth must be verified by a different individual and that\naccess to the two truths is mutually exclusive\u2014a cognitive agent\nwho knows conventional truth cannot know ultimate truth and vice versa\nexcept in the case of exalted beings who are not fully enlightened.\nThird, that each conventional entity has only one nature, namely, its\nconventional nature, and the so-called ultimate nature must not be\nassociated with any conventionally real phenomenon. If a sprout, for\nexample, actually did possess two natures as proposed in Gelug\u2019s\ntheory of the two truths, then, according to Sakya, each nature would\nhave to be ontologically distinct. Since the ontological structure of\nthe sprout cannot be separated into a so-called conventional and\nultimate nature, the sprout must possess only one phenomenal nature,\ni.e., the conventional reality. As this nature is found only under the\nspell of ignorance, it can be comprehended only under the conventional\ncognitive processes of ordinary beings, and of unenlightened noble\nbeings in their post meditative equipoise. It is therefore not\npossible, in Sakya\u2019s view, to confine the definition of ultimate truth\nto the framework of conventional phenomena.\n\nUltimate truth, on the other hand, requires the metaphysical\ntranscendence of conventionality. Unlike conventional reality, it is\nneither presupposed nor projected by ignorance. Ultimate truth, in\nGorampa\u2019s words: \u201cis inexpressible through words and is beyond\nthe scope of cognition\u201d (1969a: 370a). The cognition is always\nconceptual and thus deluded. \u201cYet ultimate truth is experienced\nby noble beings in their meditative equipoise, and is free from all\nconceptual categories. It cannot be expressed through\ndefinition, through any defined object, or through anything\nelse\u201d (1969a: 370a). In fact, Sakya goes so far as to combine\nthe definition of ultimate truth with that of intrinsic\nreality (rang bzhin, svabh\u0101va). When an\ninterlocutor ask this question: \u201cWhat is the nature of the\nreality of phenomena?\u201d Gorampa replies that reality is\ntranscendent and it has three defining characteristics: namely:\n\u201cIt is not created by causes and conditions, it exists\nindependently of conventions and of other phenomena; and it does not\nchange\u201d (Gorampa, 1969c: 326a). Like N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nhypothetical, not real, intrinsic reality, Sakya claims that\nultimate truth is ontologically unconditioned, and hence it\nis not a dependently arisen phenomenon; it is distinct from\nconventional phenomena in every sense of the word; it is\nindependent of conceptual-linguistic conventions; it is a\ntimeless and unchanging phenomenon.\n\nIt is clear then, according to Sakya view, any duality ascribed to\ntruth is untenable. Since there is only one truth, it cannot be\ndistinguished any further. Like Nyingma and Kagy\u00fc, Sakya holds\nthe view that truth itself is not divisible (Sakya\nPa\u1e47\u1e0dita n.d.: 32ab, Rendawa 1995: 122, Rongt\u00f6n Shakya\nGyaltsen, 1995: 287, n.d.: 22f Taktsang Lotsawa n.d.: 263, Shakya\nChogden 1975a: 7\u20138ff, 1975c: 222f). It agrees with Nyingma and\nKagy\u00fc that the distinction between the two truths is essentially\nbetween two conflicting perspectives, rather than any division within\ntruth as such. In Shakya Chogden\u2019s words: \u201cPrecise enumeration\n(grangs nges) of the twofold truth all the earlier Tibetans\nhave explained rests on the precise enumeration of the mistaken\ncognition (blo \u2018khrul) and unmistaken cognition\n(blo ma \u2018khrul). With this underpinning reason, they\nexplained the precise enumeration through the elimination of the third\nalternative. There is not even a single figure to be found who claims\nthe view comparable with the latter [i.e., Gelug], who asserts a\nprecise enumeration of the twofold truth based on the certification of\nreliable cognitive processes\u201d (1975a: 9\u201310ff).\n\nSakya rejects the reality of conventional truth by treating it as a\nprojection of conventional mind\u2014it is the ignorance of ordinary\nbeings. When asked this question: \u201cIf this were true, even the\nmere term conventional truth would be unacceptable, for\nwhatever is conventional is incompatible with truth,\u201d Gorampa\nReplies: \u201cSince [conventional] truth is posited only in relation\nto a conventional mind, there is no problem. Even so-called real\nconventionalities (yang dag kun rdzob ces pa yang) are\nposited as real with respect to a conventional mind\u201d (1969b:\n606b). By \u201cconventional mind,\u201d Gorampa means the ignorant\nmind of an ordinary being experiencing the phenomenal world. In other\nwords, conventional truth is described as \u201ctruth\u201d only\nfrom the perspective of ignorance. It is a truth projected (sgro\nbrtag pa) by it and taken for granted.\n\nSakya equates conventional truth with \u201cthe appearances of\nnonexistent entities like illusions\u201d (Gorampa 1969c: 287c). It\nfollows Sakya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita on this point who puts it:\n\u201cConventional truths are like reflections of the moon in the\nwater\u2014despite their nonexistence, they appear due to\nthoughts\u201d (Sakya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita 1968a: 72a). According to\nSakya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita \u201cThe defining characteristic of\nconventional truth constitutes the appearances of the nonexistent\nobjects\u201d (1968a: 72a). In this sense, conventional truths\n\u201care things apprehended by the cognition perceiving conventional\nentities. Those very things are found as nonexistent by the cognition\nanalyzing their mode of existence that is itself posited as the\nultimate\u201d (Gorampa 1969a: 377a).\n\nSince mere mind is the basis of the division of the two truths wherein\nultimate truth\u2014wisdom\u2014alone is seen as satisfying the\ncriterion of truth, so conventional truth\u2014ignorance\u2014cannot\nproperly be taken as truth. Wisdom and ignorance are invariably\ncontradictory, and thus the two truths cannot coexist. Sakya argues,\nin fact, that conventional truth must be negated in the ascent to\nultimate truth. Given wisdom\u2019s primacy over ignorance, in the final\nanalysis it is ultimate truth alone that must prevail without its\nmerely conventional counterpart. Conventional truth is an expedient\nmeans to achieve ultimate truth, and the Buddha described conventional\ntruth as truth to suit the mentality of ordinary beings (Gorampa\n1969a: 370b). The two truths are thus categorized as a means\n(thabs) and a result (thabs byung).\nConventional truth is the means to attain the one and only ultimate\ntruth.\n\nAccording to this view, then, the relationship between the two truths\nis equivalent to the relationship between the two conflicting\nperspectives\u2014namely, ignorance and wisdom. The question now\narises: How is ignorance related to wisdom? Or conversely, how does\nwisdom relate to ignorance? It says that the two truths are distinct\nin the sense that they are incompatible with unity, like\nentity and without entity. In the ultimate sense, it argues,\nthe two truths transcend identity and difference (Gorampa, 1969a:\n376d). The transcendence of identity and difference from the ultimate\nstandpoint is synonymous with the transcendence of identity and\ndifference from the purview of the meditative equipoise of noble\nbeings. However, from the conventional standpoint, it claims that the\ntwo truths are distinct in the sense that they are incompatible with\ntheir unity. It likens this relationship to the one between\nentity and without entity (Gorampa, 1969a:\n377a).\n\nSakya\u2019s claim that the two truths are distinct and incompatible\nencompasses both ontological and epistemological distinctions. Since\nwhat is divided into the two truths is mere mind, it is\nobvious that there is no single phenomenon that could serve as the\nobjective referent for both. This also means that the two truths must\nbe construed as corresponding to distinct spheres belonging to\ndistinct modes of consciousness: conventional truth corresponds to\nignorance and ultimate truth to wisdom. It is thus inappropriate to\ndescribe the relationship between the two truths, and their\ncorresponding modes of consciousness, in terms of two ways of\nperceiving the same entity. Although the two truths can be\nthought of as two ways of perceiving, one based on ignorance\nand the other on wisdom, there is no same entity perceived by\nboth. There is nothing common between the two truths, and if they are\nboth ways of perceiving, then they do not perceive the same thing.\n\nAccording to this view, the relationship between conventional truth\nand ultimate truth is analogous to the relationship between the\nappearance of falling hairs when vision is impaired by cataracts and\nthe absence of such hairs when vision is unimpaired. Although this is\na metaphor, it has a direct application to determining the\nrelationship between the two truths. Conventional truth is like seeing\nfalling hairs as a result of cataracts: both conventional truth and\nsuch false seeing are illusory, in the ontological sense that there is\nnothing to which each corresponds, and in the epistemological sense\nthat there is no true knowledge in either case. Ultimate truth is\ntherefore analogous, ontologically and epistemologically, to the true\nseeing unimpaired by cataracts and free of the appearance of falling\nhairs. Just as cataracts give rise to illusory appearances, so\nignorance, according to Sakya, gives rise to all conventional truths;\nwisdom, on the other hand, gives rise to ultimate truth. As each is\nthe result of a different state, there is no common link between them\nin terms of either an ontological identity or an epistemological or\nconceptual identity.\n",
