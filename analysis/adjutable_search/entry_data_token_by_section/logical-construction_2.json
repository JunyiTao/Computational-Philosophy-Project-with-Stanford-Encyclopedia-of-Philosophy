    "main_text": "Natural Numbers\n3. Natural Numbers\n\nRussell\u2019s definition of natural numbers as classes of\nsimilar, or equinumerous, classes, first published in\n(Russell 1901), was his first logical construction, and was the model\nfor those that followed. Similar classes are those that can be mapped\none to one onto each other by some relation. The notion of a\n\u201cone-to-one relation\u201d is defined with logical notions:\n\\(\\rR\\) is one-one when for every \\(x\\) there is a unique \\(y\\) such\nthat \\(x \\rR y\\), and for every such \\(y\\) in the range of \\(\\rR\\)\nthere is a unique such \\(x\\). These notions of existence and\nuniqueness come from logic, and so the notion of number is thus\ndefined solely in terms of classes and of logical notions. Russell\nannounced the goal of his logicist program in The Principles of\nMathematics: \u201cthe proof that all pure mathematics deals\nexclusively with concepts definable in terms of a very small number of\nfundamental logical concepts, and that all its propositions are\ndeducible from a very small number of fundamental logical\nprinciples\u2026\u201d (Russell 1903, xv). If  class\n is also shown to be a logical notion, then this definition would\ncomplete the logicist program for the mathematics of natural numbers.\n\n\nGiuseppe Peano (Peano 1889, 94) had stated axioms for elementary\narithmetic, which were later formulated by Russell (1919, 8) as:\n\n0 is a number.\nThe successor of any number is a number.\nNo two numbers have the same successor.\n0 is not the successor of any number.\nIf a property belongs to 0 and belongs to the successor of \\(x\\)\nwhenever it belongs to \\(x\\), then it belongs to every number.\n\n\nFor Peano these were the axioms of number, which, along with axioms of\nclasses and propositions, describe the properties of these entities\nand lead to the derivation of theorems that express the other\nimportant properties of those entities.\n\nRichard Dedekind (Dedekind 1887) had also listed the properties of\nnumbers with similar looking axioms, using the notion of\nchain, an infinite sequence of sets, each a subset of the\nnext, that is well ordered and has the structure of the natural\nnumbers. Dedekind then proves that the principle of induction (Axiom 5\nabove) holds for chains. (See entry on\n Dedekind).\n Although Russell finds it \u201cmost remarkable that\nDedekind\u2019s previous assumptions suffice to demonstrate this\ntheorem\u201d (Russell 1903, \u00a7236), he compares the two\napproaches, of Peano and Dedekind, with respect to simplicity and\ntheir differing ways of treating mathematical induction, and concludes\nthat:\n\n\nBut from a purely logical point of view, the two methods seem equally\nsound; and it is to be remembered that, with the logical theory of\ncardinals, both Peano\u2019s and Dedekind\u2019s axioms become\ndemonstrable. (Russell 1903, \u00a7241)\n\n\nIt was Peano and Dedekind that Russell had in mind when he later\nspeaks of \u201cthe method of \u2018postulating\u2019\u201d when\nhe compares the \u201cadvantages\u201d of their method over\nconstruction as those of theft over honest toil.\n\nTo complete his project Russell needed to find definitions and some\n\u201cvery small number of fundamental logical principles\u201d\n(Russell 1903, xv) and then produce the required derivations.\nFinding an adequate definition of classes with the \u201cno-classes\ntheory\u201d and the principles of logic needed to derive the\nproperties of numbers and classes was only completed with\nPrincipia Mathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1910\u201313).\nThis construction of numbers was a clear example of defining entities\nas classes of others so as to be able to prove certain properties as\ntheorems of logic rather than having to rest with the theft of\nhypotheses. With the device of contextual definition from the theory\nof descriptions Russell then eliminated classes too, taking as\nfundamental the logical notion of a propositional function and so\nshowing that the principles of classes where a part of logic. \n",
