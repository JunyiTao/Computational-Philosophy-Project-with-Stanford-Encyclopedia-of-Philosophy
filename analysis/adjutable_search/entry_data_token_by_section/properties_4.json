    "main_text": "Properties: Basic Ideas || Properties in Propositions and States of Affairs\n1.4 Properties in Propositions and States of Affairs\n\nWe have talked above in a way that might give the impression that\npredication is an activity that we perform, e.g., when we say\nor think that a certain apple is red. Although some philosophers might\nthink of it in this way, predication, or attribution, may\nalso be viewed as a special link that connects a property to a thing\nin a way that gives rise to a\n proposition,\n understood as a complex\nfeaturing the property and the thing (or concepts of them) as\nconstituents with different roles: the latter occurs in the\nproposition as logical subject or argument, as is\noften said, and the former as attributed to such an argument.\nIf the proposition is true (the predication is veridical), the\nargument exemplifies the property, viz. the former is an instance of\nthe latter. The idea that properties yield propositions when\nappropriately connected to an argument motivates Russell\u2019s\n(1903) introduction of the term\n\u201cpropositional\nfunction\u201d to speak of properties. We\ntake for granted here that predication is univocal. However, according\nto some neo-Meinongian philosophers, there are two modes of\npredication, sometimes characterized as \u201cexternal\u201d and\n\u201cinternal\u201d (Casta\u00f1eda 1972; Rapaport 1978; Zalta\n1983; see entry on\n nonexistent objects).\n Zalta (1983) traces back the distinction to Mally and uses\n\u201cexemplification\u201d to characterize the former and\n\u201cencoding\u201d to characterize the latter. Roughly, the idea\nis that non-existent objects may encode properties that existent\nobjects exemplify. For instance, winged is exemplified by\nthat bird over there and is encoded by the winged horse.\n\nIt is often assumed nowadays that, when an object exemplifies a\nproperty, there is a further, complex, entity, a fact or state of\naffairs (Bergmann 1960; Armstrong 1997, entries on\n facts\n and\n states of affairs),\n having the property (qua attributed) and the object\n(qua argument) as constituents (this compositional conception\nis not always accepted; see, e.g., Bynoe 2011 for a dissenting voice).\nFacts are typically taken to fulfill the theoretical roles of\ntruthmakers (the entities that make true propositions true, see entry\non\n truthmakers)\n and causal relata (the entities connected by causal\nrelations; see entry on\n the metaphysics of causation, \u00a71).\n Not all philosophers, however, distinguish between propositions and\nstates of affairs; Russell (1903) acknowledges only propositions and,\nfor a more recent example, so does Gaskin (2008).\n\nIt appears that properties can have a double role that no other\nentities can have: they can occur in propositions and facts both as\narguments and as attributed (Russell 1903: \u00a748). For example, in\ntruly saying that this apple is red and that red is a color, we\nexpress a proposition wherein red occurs as attributed, and\nanother proposition wherein red occurs as argument.\nCorrespondingly, there are two facts with red in both roles,\nrespectively. This duplicity grounds the common distinction between\ndifferent orders or types of properties:\nfirst-order ones are properties of things that are not\nthemselves predicables; second-order ones are properties of\nfirst-order properties; and so on. Even though the formal and\nontological issues behind this terminology are controversial, it is\nwidely used and is often connected to the subdivision between\nfirst-order and higher-order logics (see, e.g., Thomason 1974; Oliver\n1996; Williamson 2013; entry on\n type theory).\n It originates from Frege\u2019s and Russell\u2019s logical\ntheories, especially Russell\u2019s type theory, wherein distinctions\nof types and orders are rigidly regimented in order to circumvent the\nlogical paradoxes (see\n \u00a76).\n",
