    "main_text": "Optics and metaphysics of light\n7. Harmony and Soul\n\nFrom a philosophical point of view, Kepler considered the HM to be his\nmain work and the one he most cherished. Containing his third\nplanetary law, this work represents definitively a seminal\ncontribution to the history of astronomy. But he did not reduce his\nlong prepared project to an astronomical investigation\u2014his first\nthoughts on the notion of \u201charmony\u201d arose already in 1599,\nalthough he did not publish his work until 1619\u2014but instead\nextensively discussed its mathematical foundations and its\nphilosophical implications, including astrology, natural philosophy\nand psychology. Thus, Kepler\u2019s third planetary law appears in a\ncontext which goes far beyond astronomy and to a great extent takes up\nagain the perspective of his youthful MC. When talking about\n\u201charmony\u201d in Kepler, one needs to keep in mind that the\nbackground giving its full significance to this notion goes far beyond\nmusic theory. Of course, music is involved and plays a determining\nrole \u2013 and along with it the corresponding mathematical concepts\nstemming from the Pythagorean tradition. However, in Kepler\n\u201charmony\u201d represents the most general idea, the very core\nof the world as an ordered whole and, therefore, the ultimate goal to\nbe pursued in his philosophical investigations. Social and political\naspects are also included. It is surely not a minor detail that\nKepler, on the threshold of the Thirty Years\u2019 War, dedicated his\nHM to King James I of England \u201cthe man whom Kepler believed was\nbest suited to apply its lessons to the most pressing harmony of all:\nthe harmony of church and state\u201d (Rothman 2017, p. 6).\n\nAccording to Kepler, it is necessary to distinguish\n\u201csensible\u201d from \u201cpure\u201d harmony. The first is\nto be found among natural, sensible entities, like sounds in music or\nrays of light; both could be in proportion to one another and hence in\nharmony. He resolves this matter by combining three of the\nAristotelian categories: quantity, relation and, finally, quality.\nThrough the function of the category of relation Kepler passes over to\nthe active function of the mind (or soul). It turns out that two\nthings can be characterized as harmonic if they can be compared\naccording to the category of quantity. But the fact that at least two\nthings are needed shows that the property of \u201cbeing\nharmonic\u201d is not a property of an isolated thing. Furthermore,\nthe relationship between the things cannot be found in the things\nthemselves either; rather, it is produced by the mind: \u201cin\ngeneral every relation is nothing without mind apart from the things\nwhich it relates, because they do not have the relation which they are\nsaid to have unless the presence of some mind is assumed, to relate\none to another\u201d (KGW 6, p. 212; Engl. trans., p. 291). This\nprocess takes place through the comparison of different sensible\nthings with an archetype (archetypus) present in the\nmind.\n\nThe next central question directly concerns gnoseology, for Kepler\ngives a psychological account of the path followed by sensible things\ninto the mind. He resumes the scholastic species theory: immaterial\nspecies radiate from the sensible things and affect the sense organs\nby acting firstly on the \u201cforecourts\u201d and then on the\ninternal functions (for the notion of \u2018species\u2019 in Kepler\nsee Rabin 2005, which has found both favorable and critical reception\nin the literature). They arrive at the imagination and from there go\nover to the sensus communis, so that, according to the\ntraditional teaching, the sensible information received is now able to\nbe processed and used in statements. From here onwards, the sensible\nthings are \u201cpreserved in the memory, brought forth by\nrecollection, [and] distinguished by the higher faculty of the\nsoul\u201d (Caspar 1993, p. 269, cf. KGW 6, p. 214, lines\n18\u201323; Engl. trans., p. 293). While harmony arises as an\nactivity of the soul/mind consisting in relating quantitatively,\nKepler adds, taking over the Aristotelian doctrine of categories, that\nharmony is a \u201cqualitative relation\u201d as well, involving the\n\u201cquality of shape, being formed from the regular figures\u201d,\nwhich provides the grounds for comparison (KGW 6, p. 216, lines\n37\u201341; Engl. trans., p. 296). If this is how\n\u201cthings\u201d, i.e., sensible entities, find their way into the\nsoul in order to be compared, it by no means represents\u2014as\nKepler admitted\u2014a sufficient explanation of how non-sensible\nthings, i.e., mathematical entities, find their way into the mind. How\ndo they come into the soul? Kepler accepted Aristotle\u2019s\ncriticism of Pythagorean philosophy concerning numbers: both Kepler\nand Aristotle are convinced that numbers constitute ontologically a\nlower class within mathematical entities (for Kepler, they are derived\nfrom geometrical entities). Nevertheless, Aristotle\u2019s philosophy\nis insufficient to grasp the essence of mathematics. By aligning\nhimself with Proclus, from whom he quotes a long passage of his\nCommentary on Euclides, Kepler defends Plato\u2019s theory\nof anamn\u00easis against Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the\ntabula rasa. His discussion lies at the origin of the\nclassical debate between empiricism and rationalism which was to\ndominate the philosophical scene for generations to come. A connection\nwith idealism is, of course, apparent (see, for instance, Caspar 1993,\nEngl. trans., p. 269), and it is a fact that Kepler was positively\nreceived within German Idealism of the 19th century\n(Schwaetzer 2016, esp. 217\u201319). Historically, however, it seems\nto be more accurate to link his position with the philosophical\ntradition of St. Augustine.\n\nBesides psychology and gnoseology, the other main spectrum of\nquestions Kepler deals with in Book 4 is his theory of\n\u201caspects\u201d, i.e., astrology (HM, IV, Cap. 4\u20137), a\nfurther field of application of his psychology and further evidence of\nthe role of geometry in his philosophy. The \u201caspects\u201d,\ni.e., the angles between the planets, Moon and Sun, are all he wishes\nto save from the old astrology, which he harshly criticizes; for the\naspects are or can be reduced to geometrical structures, the\narchetypes, which can be recognized by the soul. According to Kepler,\nthere is no \u201cmechanical influence\u201d of the heavens (stars\nand constellations are not relevant in his astrology) which exerts a\ndetermining effect on the Earth and on human life. Rather, both the\nEarth and human beings, ultimately, like all other living entities,\nare provided with a soul in which the geometrical archetypes are\npresent. By the formation of an aspect in the heavens, symmetry arises\nand stimulates the soul of the Earth or of human beings. \u201cThe\nEarth,\u201d Kepler writes, responds to \u201cwhat the aspects\nwhistle\u201d (KGW 11.2, p. 48; for his astrology see especially\nField 1984 and Rabin 1997, Boner 2005 and 2006).\n",
