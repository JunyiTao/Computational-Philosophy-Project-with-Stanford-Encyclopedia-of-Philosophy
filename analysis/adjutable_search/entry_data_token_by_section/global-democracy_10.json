    "main_text": "From \u2018Model of Democracy\u2019 to \u2018Values of Democratization\u2019 || Methodological Rationale\n3.1 Methodological Rationale\n\n\nDemocratic models, as should be clear, provide relatively\nparsimonious, holistic, and idealized packages that can be pursued at\nthe global level. Archibugi et al. (2012) describe them as\n\u2018terminal endpoints\u2019 that can be strived toward. Although\nsome models provide more detailed and exact institutional design than\nothers, this general way of thinking has dominated global democracy\nscholarship. However, as Dryzek (2008, 471) has contended, while\n\u201cmodels help in thinking, they also constrain thinking.\u201d\nAs such, various authors have argued that global democracy can more\nusefully be thought of as an on-going process of democratization in\nwhich a set of values are more or less fulfilled.\n\n\nThe core idea of this approach is that, instead of treating democracy\nas an idealized set of institutions which need to be induced beyond\nthe state, we should think about the fundamental principles that\ndemocracy demands and strive for them under existing conditions. Such\nvalues may include inclusiveness, equality, popular control,\ntransparency, accountability, deliberation, or something else. These\nvalues are supposed to be pursued in different institutional locations\nby various actors in an on-going process. It does not demand any\nspecific \u2018end-point\u2019 to work toward. Global politics is\nmore democratic the more these values are fulfilled. This approach has\nseveral key methodological advantages over pursuing models of\ndemocracy.\n\n\nFirst, democracy is often understood as an essentially contested\nconcept (Gallie 1956). Essential contestation does not just mean that\ndifferent models have different strengths and weaknesses that require\nattention. Rather, it means that contestation over the meaning of\ndemocracy is inherent to the concept itself. Because models provide a\nholistic bundle of normative commitments and institutions, this is\noften thought to undercut the dynamic nature of democracy-building\n(Dryzek 2008). Moreover, because the international system is\npluralistic and complex, absolute agreement on any one model to pursue\nseems unlikely. Focusing on how different democratic values arise in\ndifferent contexts helps to allay this concern.\n\n\nSecond, engendering models of democracy beyond the state is often\nderided as being infeasible. This argument stands on several\nsub-claims (discussed above), but a general problem is that each model\nof democracy was developed within the national context. As is fairly\nobvious, the global system is not a state. As such, we cannot know in\nadvance which model is best suited to the global system, or how to go\nabout the initial stages of design. Although scholars such as Mathias\nKoenig-Archibugi (2011) have done terrific and laborious work showing\nhow the necessary conditions for national democracy can all be met at\nthe global level, it might still be preferable to open our conception\nof democracy and think about alternate ways, values, and procedures\nthat should be pursued.\n\n\nFinally, striving for values of democratization helps gain traction on\nthe non-ideal conditions of world politics. Models are, by definition,\nidealizations and thinking about the transformative process toward any\nideal is fraught with difficulties about the nature of the future. In\nthis vein, Amartya Sen (2006) has recently argued that we should not\naim for the full realization of any specified model, but rather we\nshould seek to rank alternative values and arrangements derived from\nthe normative concept in question. Erman (2012) has objected to the\nnotion that democracy can be treated as an aggregate concept composed\nof different democratic values because it fails to recognize that the\ndifferent values are inter-related. While this is true, other scholars\nhave claimed that separating democracy into core values helps to\n\u201cidentify more clearly how different democratic values relate to\neach other, to what extent they are in conflict and how such conflicts\nshould be resolved in particular circumstances\u201d (Dingwerth\n2014, 18).\n",
