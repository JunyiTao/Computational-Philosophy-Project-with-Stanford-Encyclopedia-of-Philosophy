The\nperiod 1866\u20131871 is more or less his formative period. In his first\npaper (1866), Boltzmann set himself the problem of deriving the full\nsecond law from mechanics. The notion of probability does not appear\nin this paper. The following papers, from 1868 and 1871, were written\nafter Boltzmann had read Maxwell's work of 1860 and 1867. Following\nMaxwell's example, they deal with the characterization of a gas in\nthermal equilibrium, in terms of a probability distribution. Even\nthen, he was set on obtaining more general results, and extended the\ndiscussion to cases where the gas is subject to a static external\nforce, and might consist of poly-atomic molecules. He regularly\nswitched between different conceptions of probability: sometimes this\nreferred to a time average, sometimes a particle average or, in an\nexceptional paper (1871b), it referred to an ensemble average. The\nmain result of those papers is that from the so-called\nSto\u00dfzahlansatz (SZA), i.e. an assumption about the\nnumber of collisions (or a closely analogous assumption) the\nMaxwellian distribution function is stationary, and thus an\nappropriate candidate for the equilibrium state. In some cases\nBoltzmann also argued it was the unique such state.\n\n\nHowever, in this period he also presented a completely different\nmethod, which did not rely on the SZA but rather on the ergodic\nhypothesis. This approach led to a new form of the distribution\nfunction that, in the limit \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) reduces to the\nMaxwellian form. In the same period, he also introduced the concept of\nensembles, but this concept would not play a prominent role in his\nthinking until the 1880s.\n\n\nThe next period is that of 1872\u20131878, in which he wrote his two most\nfamous papers: (1872) (Weitere Studien) and\n(1877b) (\u00dcber die Beziehung). The 1872\npaper contained the Boltzmann equation and the\nH-theorem. Boltzmann claimed that the H-theorem\nprovided the desired theorem from mechanics corresponding to the\nsecond law. However, this claim came under a serious objection due to\nLoschmidt's criticism of 1876. The objection was simply that no purely\nmechanical theorem could ever produce a time-asymmetrical\nresult. Boltzmann's response to this objection will be summarized\nlater.\n\n\nThe result was, however, that Boltzmann rethought the basis of his\napproach and in 1877b produced a conceptually very different analysis,\nwhich might be called the combinatorial argument, of\nequilibrium and evolutions towards equilibrium, and the role of\nprobability theory. The distribution function, which formerly\nrepresented the probability distribution, was now conceived of as a\nstochastic variable (nowadays called a macrostate) subject to a\nprobability distribution. That probability distribution was now\ndetermined by the size of the volume in phase space corresponding to\nall the microstates giving rise to the same macrostate, (essentially\ngiven by calculating all permutations of the particles in a given\nmacrostate). Equilibrium was now conceived of as the most probable\nmacrostate instead of a stationary macrostate. The evolution towards\nequilibrium could then be reformulated as an evolution from less\nprobable to more probable states.\n\n\nEven though all commentators agree on the importance of these two\npapers, there is still disagreement about what Boltzmann's claims\nactually were, and whether he succeeded (or indeed even attempted) in\navoiding the reversibility objection in this new combinatorial\nargument, whether he intended or succeeded to prove that most\nevolutions go from less probable to more probable states and whether\nor not he (implicitly) relied on the ergodic hypothesis in these\nworks. I shall comment on these issues in due course. (See Uffink\n(2007) for a more detailed overview.)\n\n\nThe third period is taken up by the papers Boltzmann wrote during\nthe 1880's have attracted much less attention. During this period, he\nabandoned the combinatorial argument, and went back to an approach that\nrelied on a combination of the ergodic hypothesis and the use of\nensembles. For a while Boltzmann worked on an application of this\napproach to Helmholtz's concept of monocyclic systems. However, after\nfinding that concept did not always provide the desired thermodynamical\nanalogies, he abandoned this topic again.\n\n\nNext, in the 1890s the reversibility problem resurfaced again, this\ntime in a debate in the columns of Nature.  This time\nBoltzmann chose an entirely different line of counterargument than in\nhis debate with Loschmidt. A few years later, Zermelo presented\nanother objection, now called the recurrence objection. The same\nperiod also saw the publication of the two volumes of his Lectures\non Gas Theory. In this book, he takes the hypothesis of molecular\ndisorder (a close relative of the SZA) as the basis of his\napproach. The combinatorial argument is only discussed as an aside,\nand the ergodic hypothesis is not mentioned at all. His last paper is\nan Encyclopedia article with Nabl presenting a survey of kinetic\ntheory.\n",
