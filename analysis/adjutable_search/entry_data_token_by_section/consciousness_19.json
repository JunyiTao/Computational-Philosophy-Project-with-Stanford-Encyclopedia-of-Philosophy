    "main_text": "The explanatory question: How can consciousness exist? || Prospects of explanatory success\n5.4 Prospects of explanatory success\n\n\nThe How question thus subdivides into a diverse family of more\nspecific questions depending upon the specific sort or feature of\nconsciousness one aims to explain, the specific restrictions one places\non the range of the explanans and the criterion one uses to define\nexplanatory success. Some of the resulting variants seem easier to\nanswer than others. Progress may seem likely on some of the so called\n\u201ceasy problems\u201d of consciousness, such as explaining the\ndynamics of access consciousness in terms of the functional or\ncomputational organization of the brain (Baars 1988). Others may seem\nless tractable, especially the so-called \u201chard problem\u201d\n(Chalmers 1995) which is more or less that of giving an intelligible\naccount that lets us see in an intuitively satisfying way how\nphenomenal or \u201cwhat it's like\u201d consciousness might arise\nfrom physical or neural processes in the brain.\n\n\nPositive answers to some versions of the How questions seem near at\nhand, but others appear to remain deeply baffling. Nor should we assume\nthat every version has a positive answer. If dualism is true, then\nconsciousness in at least some of its types may be basic and\nfundamental. If so,we will not be able to explain how it arises from\nnonconscious items since it simply does not do so.\n\n\nOne's view of the prospects for explaining consciousness will\ntypically depend upon one's perspective. Optimistic physicalists will\nlikely see current explanatory lapses as merely the reflection of the\nearly stage of inquiry and sure to be remedied in the not too distant\nfuture (Dennett 1991, Searle 1992, P. M.Churchland 1995). To dualists,\nthose same impasses will signify the bankruptcy of the physicalist\nprogram and the need to recognize consciousness as a fundamental\nconstituent of reality in its own right (Robinson 1982, Foster 1989,\n1996, Chalmers 1996). What one sees depends in part on where one\nstands, and the ongoing project of explaining consciousness will be\naccompanied by continuing debate about its status and prospects for\nsuccess.\n",
