The Significance of Past Wrongdoing\n\nIntergenerational justice concerns the relations between generations.\nThis section discusses the three issues that have been central to the\nphilosophical investigation of the relations between past people and\ncurrently living people and to understanding the significance of what\nhappened in the past (and, in particular, of past wrongs) for\ncurrently living (and future) people\u2019s justice claims: First,\nhow can currently living people be understood to be negatively\naffected by historical injustices? Second, can the ongoing effect of\npast wrongs become legitimate when circumstances change? And, thirdly,\nwe need to address the question of the moral status of deceased\npersons and dead victims of injustice in particular.\n",
