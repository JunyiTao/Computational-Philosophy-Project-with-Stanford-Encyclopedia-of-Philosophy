    "main_text": "\n\nMany authors use the term \u2018psychologism\u2019 for what they\nperceive as the mistake of identifying non-psychological with\npsychological entities. For instance, philosophers who think that\nlogical laws are not psychological laws would view it as psychologism\nto identify the two. Other authors use the term in a neutral\ndescriptive or even in a positive sense. \u2018Psychologism\u2019\nthen refers (approvingly) to positions that apply psychological\ntechniques to traditional philosophical problems (e.g. Ellis 1979,\n1990).\n\n\u2018Psychologism\u2019 entered the English language as a\ntranslation of the German word \u2018Psychologismus\u2019,\na term coined by the Hegelian Johann Eduard Erdmann in 1870 to\ncritically characterize the philosophical position of Eduard Beneke\n(Erdmann 1870).\n\nAlthough the term continues to be used today, criticisms and defenses\nof psychologism have mostly been absorbed into wider debates over the\npros and cons of philosophical naturalism. Therefore this entry \nfocuses on a time when, and a place where, psychologism was still a\nmuch-debated distinct issue.\n",
