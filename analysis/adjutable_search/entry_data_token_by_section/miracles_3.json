    "main_text": "Concepts and Definitions || The relevance of religious context\n1.3 The relevance of religious context\n\n\nBeyond all of these considerations, some authors have made a case for the\nrestriction of the term \u201cmiracle\u201d to events that are\nsupernaturally caused and have some palpable religious significance. An\ninsignificant shift in a few grains of sand in the lonesome desert\nmight, if it exceeded the productive powers of nature, qualify as a\nmiracle in some thin sense, but it would manifestly lack religious\nsignificance and could not be used as the fulcrum for any interesting\nargument. Considerations such as this have led many authors to build\nboth the type of agency and some intimation of the purpose into the\ndefinition of a miracle. Thus, Samuel Clarke (1719: 311\u201312) writes\nthat\n\n\nthe true Definition of a Miracle, in the\nTheological Sense of the Word, is this; that it is a work\neffected in a manner unusual, or different from the common and\nregular Method of Providence, by the interposition either of God\nhimself, or of some Intelligent Agent superiour to Man, for the Proof\nor Evidence of some particular Doctrine, or in attestation to the\nAuthority of some particular Person.\n\n\nHume also, in one of his definitions of \u201cmiracle,\u201d\nspeaks of an event brought about \u201cby a particular volition of the\nDeity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent\u201d (Hume\n1748/2000: 87). Since the paradigmatic cases under discussion are for\nthe most part claims that, if true, would answer to the theological\ndimension of Clarke\u2019s description, one might take a supernatural\ncause to be a necessary condition for an event\u2019s being a\nreligiously significant miracle and use the word \u201cmiracle\u201d\nin this sense where there is no danger of confusion. On the other hand, Basinger (2018: 4) argues that incorporating the condition of supernatural agency into the definition of a miracles would have the awkward consequence that the question of whether an event is considered miraculous would depend upon an individual\u2019s psychological sense; and while such definitions are possible, they are out of the main stream of discussion in the literature on miracles.\n\n\nOn the whole, then, the project of giving a definition for the term\n\u201cmiracle\u201d appears to have reached a point where further refinements offer only diminshing returns. A miracle is an event that\nexceeds the productive power of nature, and a religiously significant\nmiracle is a detectable miracle that has a supernatural cause. For\npractical purposes, we need nothing further. The paradigmatic claims\nunder discussion\u2014that a man who has died was raised to life again\nseveral days after his death, for example, or that water was changed\ninstantaneously into wine\u2014satisfy not only this definition but\nalso most of the alternative proposals that have been seriously\nadvanced.\n",
