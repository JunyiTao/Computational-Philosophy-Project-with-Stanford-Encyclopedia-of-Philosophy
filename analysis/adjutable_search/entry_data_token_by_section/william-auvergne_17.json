    "main_text": "The Soul || The Immortality of the Soul\n7.6 The Immortality of the Soul\n\nAccording to William, the immortality of the human soul would be\nevident if not for the fact that the soul has, as it were, been put to\nsleep by the corruption of the body stemming from the punishment for\nsin. In our current state, however, William thinks the human\nsoul\u2019s immortality can be shown by means of philosophical\narguments, to which he devotes considerable attention, both in On\nthe Soul and in a shorter work, On the Immortality of the\nSoul.\n\nHe believes the error that the soul is naturally mortal\n\u201cdestroys the foundation of morality and of all religion\u201d\n(B\u00fclow 1897, 1; Teske 1991, 23), since those who believe in the\nmortality of the soul will have no motive for acting morally and\nhonoring God. Thus, he notes that if the soul is not immortal, the\nhonor of God is pointless in this life, since in the present life it\n\u201cinvolves much torment and affliction for the soul\u201d\n(B\u00fclow 1897, 3; Teske 1991, 25) and receives no reward.\n\nFrom a metaphysical point of view, William argues that the soul does\nnot depend on the body for its being, and therefore the destruction of\nthe body does not entail the non-existence of the soul. The rational\nsoul\u2019s independence from the body is due to the fact it is a\nself-subsistent substance whose proper operations do not involve or\nrequire a human body.\n\nSince William takes the souls of plants and animals to be incorporeal\nsubstances, it might be thought that he would treat them as immortal\ntoo. But William holds that these souls cease to exist upon the death\nof the plant or animal. This is because all their proper operations,\nunlike those of the rational soul, depend on the body, and thus there\nwould be no point for their continued existence after the destruction\nof the body.\n",
