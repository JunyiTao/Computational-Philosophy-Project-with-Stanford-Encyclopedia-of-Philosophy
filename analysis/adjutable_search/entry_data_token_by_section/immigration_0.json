    "main_text": "Arguments for Closed Borders || Preserving Culture\n1.1 Preserving Culture\n\n\nThe most popular argument for the permissibility and importance of\nclosing borders to outsiders is that this exclusion is necessary in\norder to preserve a state\u2019s distinctive culture. The appeal\nof cultural continuity is easy to appreciate. As David Miller\nexplains, \u201cthe public culture of their country is something that\npeople have an interest in controlling: they want to be able to shape\nthe way that their nation develops, including the values that are\ncontained in the public culture. They may not of course succeed:\nvalued cultural features can be eroded by economic and other forces\nthat evade political control. But they may certainly have good\nreason to try, and in particular to try to maintain cultural continuity\nover time, so that they can see themselves as the bearers of an\nidentifiable cultural tradition that stretches backward\nhistorically.\u201d (Miller 2005: 200) Think of the United\nStates, for instance. If the US placed no limits on immigration\nfrom Canada, it is clear neither how many Canadians would move south,\nnor whether their migration would have a discernible affect upon\nAmerican culture. If the United States did not limit immigration\nfrom Mexico, on the other hand, it seems almost certain that much\nlarger numbers of Mexicans would migrate north and that the changes to\nAmerican culture would be regarded by many as rapid and dramatic.\n(Huntington 2005) If so, it seems likely that open borders would\nquickly lead to changes that would leave many Americans less\ncomfortable in their own homeland. Given this, the concern to\npreserve one\u2019s native culture seems to provide a reasonable\njustification for restricting immigration.\n\n\nThis line of argument invites a number of empirical and moral\nquestions. Among the empirical questions, we might ask how\nconfident we can be about the numbers and influence of the potential\nimmigrants. Is the immigrants\u2019 culture really that\ndistinctive? And are we sure that these newcomers will resist\nassimilation? Also, how can we be sure that the cultural changes\nwill be rapid and detrimental? Skeptics of this line of argument\noften object that people tend to (1) exaggerate how\ndistinctive\u2014and distinctively valuable\u2014their existing\ncultures are (it is notoriously difficult to characterize\n\u201cAmerican\u201d culture, for instance), (2) irrationally fear\nchange, and (3) underestimate how much their culture is changing\nanyway, in the absence of immigration. Even if all of these\ndescriptive objections can be definitively answered, important moral\nchallenges remain. In particular, even if citizens have an\nunderstandable interest in maintaining cultural continuity, it\nremains an open question as to whether they have a corresponding moral\nright (and, if so, one might wonder about how weighty this right\nis). These questions matter, because outsiders may also have\ncompeting interests in, and/or rights to, enter the country in\nquestion, and thus they may permissibly be excluded only if the rights\nof insiders to preserve their cultural continuity outweigh any rights\nof foreigners to enter the political territory.\n\n\nFinally, even if each of these moral challenges could also be\nconclusively answered, this approach would not justify excluding all\noutsiders. At most, it could explain only why countries would be\nentitled to limit the flow of culturally distinct\nimmigrants. To put this point in terms of the United States, for\ninstance, even if the aim of preserving American culture would justify\nplacing limits on Mexican immigration, it would not seem to justify\nexcluding all Mexicans, let alone all Canadians.\n",
