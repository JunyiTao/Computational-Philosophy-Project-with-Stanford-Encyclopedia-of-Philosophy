    "main_text": "Moral Reality and Moral Realism || Moral reality as metaphysics\n5.5 Moral reality as metaphysics\n\nA final thread in Murdoch\u2019s view of reality is that it is what\nmetaphysics describes. She understands metaphysics as an\nall-encompassing view of a transcendent reality, of the universe, that\nthe individual must then attempt to come to understand in order to\nwork out her place in it (M&E 1957/EM: 70). In \u201cMetaphysics\nand Ethics\u201d she mentions Thomism, Hegelianism, and Marxism as\nexamples. These metaphysical systems and pictures are deeply ethical\nand evaluative, but, she implies, also provide a broader conception of\nreality. In her 1950s essays, she defends metaphysical thinking not so\nmuch as true, as capturing reality, but as a coherent way of thinking\nabout the moral endeavor of life that is excluded by the linguistic\nturn in philosophical ethics, and which thereby refutes (Hare\u2019s)\nuniversal prescriptivism\u2019s claim to be the sole moral theory\nconsistent with \u201cthe language of morals\u201d. She is\nsympathetic to some moral, political, and philosophical/analytic\ncriticisms of metaphysical systems (especially that they can lose a\nsense of the value of the individual [M&E 1957/EM: 70; Antonaccio\n1996: 115f], and an acknowledgment of ultimate contingency [MGM 1992:\n490]). Nevertheless, her evolving moral views always leave room for\nsome kind of transcendent structure beyond the individual that retains\nethical authority over the moral agent. The title of her final\nsummative work, Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals, expresses\nthis continuing role for metaphysics in her thinking about morality\nand reality. As Diamond argues, she is not thinking of\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d as a non-morally-informed enterprise, as it\nis sometimes understood. In that form, Diamond says, Murdoch would not\nthink it positioned to dictate what possibilities are open to moral\nphilosophy (Diamond 2010). A metaphysics of actual reality cannot\navoid being morally informed.\n\nThe Platonic strand of moral reality can of course be seen as\nexemplifying the metaphysics strand, but the latter remains a more\ngeneral idea within Murdoch\u2019s complex overall view of moral reality. The\n\u201cother persons\u201d strand seems less metaphysical and thus\ncontrary to the final strand. But Murdoch often speaks of the reality\nof other people in \u201ctranscendental\u201d\nterms\u2014transcending the individual ego\u2014and this framing\nthereby retains an element important to her complex and shifting\nunderstanding of metaphysics. All three strands play a role in\nMurdoch\u2019s thinking about (moral) reality, but the other persons\nand the Good are distinctly more prominent.\n",
