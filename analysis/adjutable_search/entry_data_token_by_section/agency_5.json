    "main_text": "Conceptions, theories, and kinds of agency || Agency without mental representations\n2.4 Agency without mental representations\nArguments for the claim that the standard theory does not account\nfor important aspects of agency are usually driven by a focus on\ndistinctively human agency. Once we shift our focus to non-human\nagents, and simpler organisms, a very different challenge\nemerges. When we turn to such agents, it seems that the standard\ntheory is clearly too demanding. The view explains agency in terms of\nthe agent\u2019s desires, beliefs, and intentions. Usually, it is\nassumed that this is an explanation in terms of mental\nrepresentations: in terms of intentional mental states and events that\nhave representational contents (typically, propositional contents). It\nseems, however, that there are beings that are capable of genuine\nagency and that do not possess representational mental states. We can\ndistinguish here between three claims (and three\nchallenges). According to the first, there are non-human beings that\nare capable of agency and that do not possess representational mental\nstates. Second, there are many instances of human agency that can and\nshould be explained without the ascription of representational mental\nstates. Third, all instances of agency can and should be explained\nwithout the ascription of representational mental states. We turn to\neach claim in turn.\nWe have a pervasive tendency to interpret and explain behavior in\nterms of intentional mental states. We tend, even, to interpret the\ninteraction between animated objects in terms of desires, beliefs, and\nintentions (Heider and Simmel 1944). This raises the question of when\nit is appropriate to attribute mental states in the explanation of\nbehavior. According to an instrumentalist stance (Dennett 1987:\nCh. 2), the question of when it is appropriate to ascribe mental\nstates cannot be separated from the question of when it is appropriate\nto ascribe agency, and both questions are to be answered in terms of\npredictive success: it is appropriate to attribute mental states in\nthe explanation of agency when doing so supports successful\npredictions of behavior. However, most proponents of the standard\ntheory presume some form of realism, according to which the ascription\nof mental states is appropriate only if the agent in question\npossesses the right internal states with the right representational\ncontents. The question of what the possession of representational\nmental states consists in is one of the most controversial questions\nin the philosophy of mind and cognitive science, and it is clearly\nbeyond the scope of this entry (see the entries on\nmental representation\nand\ncognitive science). Consider, though, the following remarks. Davidson (1982) held the view\nthat only human agents have the relevant mental attitudes, because he\nthought that having such attitudes requires linguistic\ncompetence. Others have argued that we are justified in ascribing\nrepresentational mental states to non-human agents if doing so\nprovides the best explanation of their behavior (Allen and Bekoff\n1997, for instance). Sometimes it is rather difficult to decide\nwhether or not the best explanation of an agent\u2019s behavior\nrequires the ascription of representational mental states. Sterelny\n(2001: Ch. 11, 12), for instance, has argued that plausible\nexplanations in terms of desires can sometimes be replaced by equally\ngood explanations in terms of drives. The ascription of a desire is\nusually construed as the ascription of a representational mental\nstate, whereas a drive can be construed in terms of more basic\nmechanisms (and without the ascription of representational\ncontent). What is important to bear in mind, here, is that the issue\nconcerns not only the possession of the relevant mental states and\nevents. It concerns, moreover, the capacity to combine or process the\ncontents of such attitudes in rational inferences: the capacity to\ntreat the relevant contents as premises in practical reasoning (as\nemphasized by Anscombe 1957 and Davidson 1970).\nSuppose, for the sake of argument, that it is appropriate to\nascribe representational mental states to non-human beings of various\nkinds. It may still be the case that there are other kinds of\nnon-human beings that are capable of agency and that do not possess\nrepresentational mental states. Would this show that the standard\ntheory is too demanding? Only if the standard theory is construed as\nproviding an account of agency as such. According to a less\ndemanding view, the standard theory provides an account of one\nparticularly interesting and central kind of agency:\nintentional agency (and the kind of unintentional agency that derives\nfrom it; see\nsection 2).[9] On this construal, the standard theory is perfectly compatible with\nthe claim that there are more basic kinds of agency, including kinds\nof agency that do not require the possession of representational\nmental states. It is, for instance, compatible with what Barandiaran\net al. (2009) call \u201cminimal agency\u201d. On their view, an\nagent is a unified entity that is distinguishable from its environment\nand that is doing something by itself in accord with a certain goal\n(or norm). This view departs from the standard conception and theory\nin its characterization of action (\u201cdoing something\u201d) in\nterms of the \u201cadaptive regulation\u201d of the agent\u2019s\n\u201ccoupling with the environment\u201d and in terms of metabolic\nself-maintenance (inspired by Varela et al. 1974). They suggest that\norganisms as simple as bacteria exhibit this minimal kind of\nagency. The crucial point is that this provides an account of\ngoal-directed behavior that does not appeal to the mental\nrepresentation of goals. Barandiaran et al. suggest, rather, that\neven very simple organisms can be said to have the intrinsic\ngoal to be: to bring about the continuation of their\nexistence.\nWe turn now to the second claim, which says that many instances of\nhuman agency can and should be explained without the ascription of\nrepresentational mental states. This view is usually based on and\nmotivated by embodied and enactive approaches in the philosophy of\nmind and cognitive science. Some versions of this approach are\ninspired by the works Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty (Dreyfus\n1991, 2002), others are based on more recent developments in robotics\nand dynamical systems theory (Brooks 1991; Beer 1995). Common to such\nviews is the focus on skillful and \u201conline\u201d engagement with the world:\nthe ability to engage with others and with one\u2019s circumstances\nby responding to the demands of the situation in a skillful and often\neffortless manner, without conscious deliberation, reasoning, or\nplanning (often called \u201cskilled coping\u201d). Examples of\nhuman agency include instances of habitual action, such as the actions\nthat one performs while driving a car, and cases where the agent is\nengaged in a responsive flow of interaction, such as in jazz\nimprovisation or in verbal exchanges. Examples from robotics include\nskills like the coordination of limb movements and the ability to\nnavigate through novel environments. The challenge to the standard\ntheory often involves the following three points. First, it is argued\nthat the explanation of such skills and abilities in terms of mental\nrepresentations is both costly and clumsy: it imposes very high\ndemands on the agent\u2019s information-processing resources and it\nleads to an inelegant and implausible overpopulation of highly\nspecific mental representations. Second, it is pointed out that\ncurrent accounts of mental representation are untenable or, at least,\ncontroversial and that there is no obvious reason to think that there\nwill ever be a generally accepted account of mental\nrepresentation. Third, it is argued that the explanation of skilled\ncoping does not require the ascription of representational mental\nstates, because it can be explained in terms of behavioral\ndispositions and direct guidance by the relevant features of the\nsituation. The proposed conclusion is that we should, therefore,\nexplain instances of skilled coping without reference to\nrepresentational mental states and events.\nIn response, proponents of the standard theory (and of\nrepresentational theories of mind) usually argue as follows. First, it\nis pointed out that the standard theory does not require that the\nagent considers the relevant mental contents in conscious deliberation\nor reasoning. This reduces the information-processing demands to a\nsignificant degree. Second, it is argued that the standard theory is\ncompatible with explanations of habitual actions in terms of motor\nschemata (or motor intentions). Motor schemata are not represented in\nthe contents of personal-level mental states, and they are usually\nrecruited automatically in the service of personal-level goals and\nintentions. The utilization of motor schemata further reduces the\nrequired processing load. Third, it is pointed out that most instances\nof skilled coping do not occur in an intentional vacuum, as it were.\nThey are, rather, usually constrained by and often integrated with the\nagent\u2019s long-term goals and intentions. Given this, it seems\nthat a full explanation of skilled coping must, at some point or\nlevel, make reference to representational mental states after\nall. (For more on this see Clark and Toribio 1994; Antony 2002; Rey\n2002; Adams 2010; Clarke 2010b; Schlosser 2018.)\nAccording to the third claim, all instances of agency, including\nall instances of human agency, can and should be explained without the\nascription of representational mental states. This position is usually\nmotivated by radical versions of the embodied and enactive approach to\nthe mind (Chemero 2009; Silberstein and Chemero 2011; Hutto and Myin\n2014). The main strategy here is usually to generalize the argument\noutlined above: explanations in terms of representational mental\nstates are costly and clumsy; there is no generally accepted account\nof mental representation; and there is reason to think that we will,\neventually, be able to explain all kinds of agency without the\nascription of representational mental states. This radical view raises\nsome obvious and difficult questions. How can one explain our ability\nto deliberate about the future without assuming mental\nrepresentations? How can one explain reasoning about abstract\nconcepts, counterfactuals, and theoretical generalizations? And how\ncan one explain that our agency is to a significant extent motivated,\nguided, and constrained by our long-terms plans and commitments?\nTemporally extended planning agency (Bratman 1987, 2000) is clearly a\n\u201crepresentation-hungry\u201d phenomenon: it is difficult to see\nhow it can be explained without the ascription of representational\nmental states (Clark and Toribio 1994; Schlosser 2018; see also the entry on\nembodied cognition).\n\n",
