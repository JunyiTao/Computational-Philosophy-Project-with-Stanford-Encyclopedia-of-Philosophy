    "main_text": "\nIntuitionistic type theory (also constructive type theory or\nMartin-L\u00f6f type theory) is a formal logical system and philosophical\nfoundation for\n constructive mathematics. It is a\nfull-scale system which aims to play a similar role for constructive\nmathematics as\n Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory\n does for\nclassical mathematics. It is based on the propositions-as-types\nprinciple and clarifies the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation\nof intuitionistic logic. It extends this interpretation to the more\ngeneral setting of intuitionistic type theory and thus provides a\ngeneral conception not only of what a constructive proof is, but also\nof what a constructive mathematical object is. The main idea is that\nmathematical concepts such as elements, sets and functions are\nexplained in terms of concepts from programming such as data\nstructures, data types and programs. This article describes the formal\nsystem of intuitionistic type theory and its semantic foundations.\nIn this entry, we first give an overview of the most important\naspects of intuitionistic type theory\u2014a kind of \u201cextended\nabstract\u201d. It is meant for a reader who is already somewhat\nfamiliar with the theory. Section 2 on the other hand, is meant for a\nreader who is new to intuitionistic type theory but familiar with\ntraditional logic, including propositional and predicate logic,\narithmetic, and set theory. Here we informally introduce several\naspects which distinguishes intuitionistic type theory from these\ntraditional theories. In Section 3 we present a basic version of the\ntheory, close to Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s first published version from\n1972. The reader who was intrigued by the informality of Section 2\nwill now see in detail how the theory is built up. Section 4 then\npresents a number of important extensions of the basic theory. In\nparticular, it emphasizes the central role of inductive (and\ninductive-recursive) definitions. Section 5 introduces the underlying\nphilosophical ideas including the theory of meaning developed by\nMartin-L\u00f6f. While Section 5 is about philosophy and foundations,\nSection 6 gives an overview of mathematical models of the theory. In\nSection 7 finally, we describe several important variations of the\ncore Martin-L\u00f6f \u201cintensional\u201d theory described in\nSection 3 and 4.\n",
