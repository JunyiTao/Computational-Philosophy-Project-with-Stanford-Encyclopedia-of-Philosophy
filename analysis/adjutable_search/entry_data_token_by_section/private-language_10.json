    "main_text": "Kripke\u2019s Sceptical Wittgenstein\n4.1 The Community View Revisited\n\nAlthough, as was just said, the community view is not easily\nreconciled with part of Wittgenstein\u2019s text, the matter is less clear\nthan has been indicated so far. Significantly, even the most careful,\ninsightful and sympathetic of Wittgenstein\u2019s commentators have divided\non this matter (for example, Malcolm for the community view, and Baker\nand Hacker against it). The dispute is partly explained by the fact\nthat the original texts (including some from Wittgenstein\u2019s\nmanuscripts) seem to point two ways, some supporting the account given\nabove (that the burden of the argument is that language must be\npotentially social), others the community view that language is\nessentially social.\n\nThat is, textual support can be found for two apparently conflicting\nexegetical claims:\n\nLanguage is essentially social. \nIt is conceptually (even if not psychologically) possible that a\nlifelong Crusoe (i.e., a human being isolated from birth) should\nemploy some kind of linguistic system and follow rules in so\ndoing.\n\n\nAnd the contending parties share the assumption that the conflict is\ngenuine.\n\nThere is, however, reason to believe that this assumption is false,\nfor investigation of Wittgenstein\u2019s notions of essential,\npossible and lifelong Crusoe shows that admission of\nthe first claim does not commit him to the denial of the second. To\ntake the first notion: on Wittgenstein\u2019s view, while chess is\nessentially a game for two players, this does not exclude the\npossibility of playing it against oneself provided such solitary games\nare not regarded as paradigm instances of chess. Similarly, he can\nclaim that language is essentially social, but still allow the\npossibility of exceptions provided these are peripheral cases. The\nissue is complex, and its pursuit would lead away from the current\narticle\u2019s purpose of articulating the central text. For a detailed\naccount, the reader is referred to Canfield [1996] (to which this\nsection is indebted, and which also contains a useful bibliography of\nthe debate over the community view), and to Hacker [2010].\n",
