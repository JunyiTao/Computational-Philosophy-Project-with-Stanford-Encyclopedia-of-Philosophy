Meaning and Speech Acts\n\nWhat\u2019s needed to decide whether there\u2019s an intentional\nfallacy, whether (1) does or doesn\u2019t provide criterial evidence\nfor (2), is, more than anything else, a theory of meaning. A theory of\nmeaning is a theory of what it is for w (some object, in the\nbroad sense of the term) to mean p. Beardsley was always\naware of the need for a theory of meaning, and in Aesthetics\nhe proposed one, a complicated theory which he later rejected. A few\nyears later, however, in his final paper on the topic,\u00a0he\nembraced a speech-act theory based on the work of William Alston and\nused it to defend the intentional fallacy.\n\nSpeech act theory in general is derived from the work of J.L. Austin,\na British philosopher who flourished shortly after World War II.\nAustin distinguishes three things a person typically does in uttering\na sentence, say, \u201cThe door is open\u201d. He utters certain\nwords\u2014\u201cthe\u201d, \u201cdoor\u201d, \u201cis\u201d,\nand \u201copen\u201d\u2014with certain meanings; this is a\nlocutionary act. He states that the door is open; this is an\nillocutionary act. And he convinces someone that the door is open;\nthis is a perlocutionary act. As Austin says, it is in\nuttering a sentence with a certain meaning (that is, in\nperforming a locutionary act) that we perform an illocutionary act.\nIllocutionary acts have come to be called speech acts. Asserting,\nrequesting, arguing, ordering, promising, and so on are all examples\nof speech acts, but there are many, many different speech acts. Last,\nas Austin also says, it is by uttering a certain sentence\nwith a certain meaning that we perform certain other acts, acts partly\ndefined in terms of their effects on listeners: convincing, enraging,\npleasing, deceiving, and so on. These are perlocutionary acts. I utter\nthe words \u201cThe door is open\u201d; in doing so, I\nstate that the door is open; by so doing, I convince you that\nthe door is open.\n\nThese suggestive distinctions led Alston to believe that the meaning\nof a sentence is the sentence\u2019s total speech act potential, its\npotential for performing all of the various speech acts it could be\nused to perform. In effect, this is to take the slogan \u201cMeaning\nis use\u201d very seriously, and to cash in \u201cuse\u201d in\nterms of the performance of speech acts. Sentence meaning is primary\non this theory, and word meaning secondary and derivative, since\nit\u2019s defined in terms of a word\u2019s contribution to the\nspeech act potential of the sentences into which it can figure.\nBeardsley thought this theory correct and used it to argue that the\nintentional fallacy is indeed a fallacy.\n\nIn \u201cIntentions and Interpretations\u201d (1982), he claims that\nin composing a poem the poet doesn\u2019t perform a speech act, but\nrather represents the performance of a speech act or acts. When\nWordsworth writes\n\n\nMilton! Thou shouldst be living at this hour:\n\nEngland hath need of thee\u2014\n\n\nhis words are ostensibly addressed to a long-dead poet, but to perform\nan illocutionary, any illocutionary action, a person must believe that\nhe can \u201csecure uptake\u201d, that is, secure understanding of\nhis sentence and the speech act performed. Wordsworth, however, knew\nthat Milton was long dead\u00a0and had no such belief. He thus\ndidn\u2019t perform the illocutionary act of addressing Milton or\nstating that England needs him. He does represent the performance of\nthose illocutionary acts, however. What poets and other authors of\nliterary works do, Beardsley thinks, is represent the performance of\nillocutionary acts, not perform illocutionary acts themselves.\n\nTo perform illocutionary acts A, B, and C\nis therefore one thing; to represent the performance of illocutionary\nacts, A, B, and C, quite another. The\nlatter doesn\u2019t entail the former, as the above example shows. In\naddition, even if the performance of an illocutionary act is\nnecessarily intentional in one respect\u2014and Beardsley says that\n\u201conly intentional text production can generate illocutionary\nactions\u201d (II: 195)\u2014it doesn\u2019t follow that the\nperformance of illocutionary act x requires, as a condition\nfor its performance, the intention to perform x. I can\ninadvertently insult or warn someone. Some illocutionary acts are\ndefined in terms of an intention, of course\u2014lying, for instance,\nis defined in terms of the intention to deceive\u2014but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean lying is defined in terms of the intention to lie.\nThat would be circular. And it also doesn\u2019t mean that\nrepresenting the act of lying requires the intention to deceive.\nStorytellers frequently represent the act of lying without having any\nsuch intention. A person could intend to lie, or intend to represent\nthe act of lying, of course, but those are different matters.\n\nThe upshot of this is that\n\n\nit is\u2026 plain that representing [an illocutionary act,\nsuch as] an accusation cannot have as its condition an intention to\naccuse, and indeed these are somewhat at odds, for to take the\nrepresentational stance is to renounce or withhold or suspend the\nillocutionary action. (II: 197)\n\n\nThe complete argument, then, is something like this:\n\n(1)\nThe meaning of a sentence \u2018S\u2019 is its total\nillocutionary act potential, that is, its capacity to be used to\nperform the speech acts, I, J, K.\n(2)\nThe performance of speech acts I, J, K\nin using \u2018S\u2019 does not require the corresponding\nintentions to perform speech acts I, J, K\nin using \u2018S.\u2019\n(3)\nThus, the meaning of \u2018S\u2019 is independent of\nthe intentions of the speaker to perform the speech acts that\nconstitute, as potentially performable acts, the meaning of\n\u2018S.\u2019\n(4)\nDifferently put, the meaning of \u2018S\u2019 is\nlogically independent of the speaker\u2019s intention to mean what\n\u2018S\u2019 does in fact mean.\n(5)\nTherefore, a speaker\u2019s intention that sentence\n\u2018S\u2019 mean p is logically irrelevant to\nwhether it does mean p.\n(6)\nBut even if\n (4)\n were false, and the meaning, M, of a non-literary\nsentence\u2014a sentence not in a work of literature\u2014were\npartly a function of the speaker\u2019s intention that it mean\nM, the same wouldn\u2019t be true of a literary\nsentence.\n\n\nThe proof of\n (6)\n is that\n\n(7)\nAn author does not perform an illocutionary act, I,\nJ, K in uttering (writing, dictating, signing, etc.)\n\u2018S.\u2019\n(8)\nRather, he represents the performance of illocutionary acts\nI, J, K in uttering\n\u2018S.\u2019\n(9)\nRepresenting an illocutionary action involves renouncing,\nwithholding, or suspending the performance of that action.\n(10)\nThus, representing the performance of I, J,\nK doesn\u2019t require the intention to perform I,\nJ, K.\n(11)\nConsequently, even if\n (4)\n were false as far as non-literary sentences were concerned, it would\nbe true as far as literary sentences were concerned, for the meaning\nof \u2018S\u2019 is logically independent of the\nspeaker\u2019s intention to mean what \u2018S\u2019 in\nfact does mean.\n\n\nThis is an interesting and provocative argument, but it can be\nquestioned at several points. One of its limitations is that, even if\nit\u2019s successful, it proves only that an author\u2019s\nintentions are irrelevant to the correct interpretation of his text.\nEssentially employing speech act theory as it does, it doesn\u2019t\napply to the interpretation of works of art other than\nliterature\u2014paintings, sculptures, and dances, for example. This\nis a minor point, though, as analogous concepts are probably\navailable, or could be introduced without too much unnaturalness, in\nall the arts.\n\nMore bothersome is that the key concept here is an unexplained and\nseemingly unexplainable one. No one has provided a rigorous definition\nof a speech act. Even these many years after Austin first introduced\nthe concept in the 1950s, little more has been done to clarify and\nground it than to cite some handy examples, place the foils of\nlocutionary and perlocutionary acts to the left and right of it, and\ninvoke the \u201cin\u201d versus \u201cby\u201d distinction found\nabove and in virtually every other exposition of the notion. Most\nphilosophers are at least somewhat hesitant to make a concept\nthat\u2019s technical yet so little explained or pinned down the\nmainstay of a substantial theory, such as a theory of meaning.\n\nThat aside, speech act theories of meaning have received their own\nshare of criticism over the years. One objection to a theory like\nAlston\u2019s\u2014and the acceptability of his theory can\u2019t\nbe pursued at length here\u2014is that it explicates sentence meaning\nin terms of speech act potential, and thus requires that the\nillocutionary acts that a sentence can be used to perform be\nidentifiable independently of and prior to the meaning of the sentence\nused to perform those illocutionary acts. But that\u2019s impossible,\nthe objection runs, and in fact gets things backward. To identify the\nact of stating that the door is open, rather than, say, the act of\nasking for an ice cream cone, as an act that the sentence \u201cThe\ndoor is open\u201d can be used to perform\u2014to identify the\nformer but not the latter as part of the sentence\u2019s speech act\npotential\u2014requires that the meaning of the sentence first be\nunderstood and identified. Absent an understanding of its meaning,\nit\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what acts it could be used to perform.\nSpeech act potential is a function of meaning, not, as the theory has\nit, meaning a function of speech act potential.\n\nIndependent of these objections is the fact that the argument\ndoesn\u2019t really prove what it\u2019s supposed to. If it\u2019s\ncorrect, it shows that within and/or without literary discourse,\nit\u2019s possible for \u2018S\u2019 to mean M\nwithout it being true that the speaker or author intended that\n\u2018S\u2019 mean M. But all that means is that\n\n\n\u2018S\u2019 means M\n\n\ndoesn\u2019t entail\n\n\nThe speaker or author intended that \u2018S\u2019 mean\nM.\n\n\nIn effect, this is another demonstration that Hirsch is wrong, that\nsentence meaning isn\u2019t identical with speaker meaning. The\nquestion at issue, however, is whether speaker meaning is criterial\nevidence for sentence meaning. For all that the argument shows, it\ncould well be.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of whether literature is representation,\nthat is, as Beardsley uses the term, one kind of \u201cimitation of a\ncompound illocutionary act\u201d. \u201cThe writing of a\npoem\u201d, Beardsley writes elsewhere (PC: 58, 59),\n\n\nis not an illocutionary act; it is the creation of a fictional\ncharacter performing a fictional illocutionary act.\n\n\nBut in his Essay on Man, does Pope create a fictional\ncharacter who details his views, or does he simply speak his mind in\npoetic form? The more intuitive answer is the latter, but Beardsley is\ncommitted to the former. What makes the Essay on Man\ndidactic, he says, is not that it contains arguments put forward by\nPope (arguing is an illocutionary act), but that it contains\nimitations of arguments put forward by a fictional character (PC:\n60\u201361). We know this because Pope\n\n\nembodies his doctrines in a discourse that flaunts its poetic form (in\nsound and meaning) and directs attention to itself as an object of\nrewarding scrutiny.\n\n\nThe \u201cillocutionary fuse is [therefore] drawn\u201d, and the\npoem\n\n\nrelinquishes its illocutionary force for aesthetic status, and takes\non the character of being an appearance or a show of living language\nuse. (PC: 60)\n\n\nAlthough this position can\u2019t be definitively refuted, it\u2019s\nimplausible\u00a0and subject to the rejoinder that what Pope did is\nhimself speak in the poem, making sure that neither aesthetic interest\nnor useful instruction were ever altogether lacking. Independent of\nstrong theoretical reasons for thinking otherwise, that\u2019s a\nsimpler and better explanation than Beardsley\u2019s. The point can\nbe reinforced if didactic literary works other than poems are\nconsidered. Aldous Huxley\u2019s essays are literary works, but\nit\u2019s even more implausible to posit a fictional speaker for\nthem, and to think of them as imitations of compound illocutionary\nacts, rather than simply as compound speech acts performed by\nHuxley.\n\nBut even if Beardsley\u2019s view that a literary work is a\nrepresentation or imitation of a speech act is acceptable, still\nanother curious feature of the argument concerns his treatment of the\ndistinction between performing a speech act and representing the\nperformance of a speech act. Beardsley writes as if the two were\nmutually exclusive. They\u2019re not. While it\u2019s true that\nit\u2019s one thing to state that p and quite another to\nrepresent that someone is stating that p, representing (in\nlanguage) is itself a speech act just as much as stating is.\nRepresenting that someone is stating that p is like stating\nthat someone is stating that p\u2014just a speech act with a\nmore complicated conceptual content and structure than simply stating\nthat p. Given that that\u2019s so, the two halves of\nBeardsley argument,\n (1)\u2013(5)\n and\n (6)\u2013(11),\n merge.\n\nAnd it\u2019s probably a good thing that representing is a speech\nact. If \u201cMilton!\u201d in Wordsworth\u2019s poem were being\nused in a representation that wasn\u2019t the performance of any\nspeech act at all, that would presumably be because it had no speech\nact potential. On the Alston/Beardsley theory of meaning, it would\nthen have no meaning. Since it evidently does have meaning, it has to\nhave some speech act potential. And since it seems to share a good\ndeal of its meaning with \u201cMilton!\u201d as bellowed by a\nseventeenth century fish-monger hailing the poet, its speech act\npotentials within and without the poem must overlap to a fair\nextent\u2014all this on the assumption that the Alston/Beardsley\ntheory of meaning is correct. The gulf that Beardsley sees between\nliterary discourse and non-literary discourse, as far as speech acts\nare concerned, thus isn\u2019t nearly as wide as he seems to think,\neven if a literary work is a representation or imitation of a speech\nact.\n",
