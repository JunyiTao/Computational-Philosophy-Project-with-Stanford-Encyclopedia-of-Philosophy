We now wish to enact a social minimum to\nensure that all members of a society have reasonable access to the\nresources necessary to lead such a life. A key term here is\n\u201creasonable access\u201d. What is meant by this term? Why not\nsay simply that society should ensure that its members have the\nresources they need to lead a minimally decent life? Why take this\napparently roundabout way of expressing things by saying that they\nought to have reasonable access to such resources, rather than the\nresources themselves?\n\nWe use this formulation so as to keep open at this stage some\nimportant questions about the terms on which people may/ought to\nreceive these resources. It is tempting to think of enacting a social\nminimum as introducing institutions and policies that will\ngive people the resources necessary to lead a minimally\ndecent life in their society. However, this is possibly too\nrestrictive an understanding of what it can mean to enact a social\nminimum. To see why, consider the following case. There is an\nindividual, called Arya, who is unemployed and hence unable to buy\nfood and shelter. As things stand, Arya lacks the resources necessary\nto lead a minimally decent life; they are living, as we might say,\nbelow the social minimum. However, the government responds to their\nplight by offering them a job with a wage equal to the level of the\nsocial minimum. Now, provided that Arya is able to work, and the work\nin question is not demeaning or punitive, or the terms of employment\notherwise unfair, we can reasonably say that if the government does\nthis for all those in Arya\u2019s position then, for them, it has enacted a\nsocial minimum. But clearly it has not given Arya and others\nlike them a social minimum. Rather, it has intervened in a way that\nprovides Arya and these others with reasonable access to the\nsocial minimum.\n\nNow it might well be that in some cases\u2014perhaps, in the majority\nof cases\u2014the most appropriate way to ensure reasonable access to\nthe social minimum is precisely to give people the resources in\nquestion. If, say, Arya is simply unable to do a job, then offering\nthem the job will not provide reasonable access to the social minimum.\nIt will be appropriate just to give them the social minimum. And, as\nwe shall see below (see section\n 3.2),\n some philosophers argue that the ethically most defensible policy is\nto give everybody a social minimum, rather than conditioning the\nsocial minimum on work or some other kind of behavior. However, this\nis just one view of the form that the social minimum policy regime\nshould take, and it would be inappropriate to build this specific view\ninto our very definition of what a social minimum policy regime is,\nand thus, of what it means to enact a social minimum. The substantive\nethical debate about the desirability of\n\u201cconditionality\u201d\u2014making resources conditional on\nbehaviour, such as work-related activity\u2014is one we shall return\nto below (see section\n 3.2).\n",
