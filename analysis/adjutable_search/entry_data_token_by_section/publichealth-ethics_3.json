    "main_text": "What Makes Public Health, And Therefore Public Health Ethics, Distinctive? || Concluding Remarks\n1.3 Concluding Remarks\n\nCommon to both features of public health is the question of how\nbroadly or narrowly to understand what public health entails (Powers\nand Faden 2006; Coggon 2012; Anomaly 2011; Dees 2018). In many\nnational contexts, there is no sharp divide between what some consider\nthe traditional functions of public health, such as ensuring that the\nwater and food supply are safe, protecting the public from infectious\ndisease, and health promotion, and the organization and financing of\npersonal medical care services. This is especially the case when the\nprovision or financing of personal medical care is solely or primarily\na state function. In the bioethics literature, the ethics of health\ncare policy is sometimes distinguished from the ethics of public\nhealth. As we will see in Section 2, much of the literature on justice\nand health has focused on medical care and the criteria that should be\nused to determine coverage decisions about specific personal medical\ncare interventions that are delivered to individual patients in\nclinical facilities. One way to think about this is to conceptualize\nthe ethics of health care policy as an intersecting territory between\npublic health ethics and the ethics of clinical practice. Although we\nhave focused in this section on two features of public health that\ndistinguish it from clinical care, it is worth noting that there are\nthese intersecting territories and that they have implications for\npublic health ethics. For example, in the many contexts where\ngovernment agencies have ultimate authority over what medical care\nservices patients can receive, the ethics of coverage decisions must\ntake account of their impact on the ethics of the doctor-patient\nrelationship in addition to efficiency and other considerations of\njustice that public health allocation decisions standardly engage.\n\n\nThere are also intersecting territories between public health and\nbiomedical science, again with implications for public health ethics.\nFor example, advances in AI-assisted big data analysis, genomic\ndatabase, and gene editing offer potentially unprecedented\nopportunities for public health to better predict and respond to\nhealth threats. (Geller et al., 2014) Questions are emerging about\nwhether the use of these scientific advances in service of public\nhealth adds anything new or different from the ways in which the\nlegitimacy issues discussed in Section 3 should be evaluated.\n\nThat there are overlapping territories between public health, clinical\ncare and biomedical science is, of course, to be expected as these\nenterprises are all committed to advancing human health. The major\nchallenge is to answer the question of how broadly or narrowly to\nunderstand what public health entails. Given a wide understanding of\nhealth and the factors affecting prospects for population health,\npublic health can be viewed as being so expansive as to have no\nmeaningful institutional, disciplinary, or social boundaries.\nEverything from crime, war, and natural disasters; to population\ngenetics, environmental hazards, marketing and other corporate\npractices; to political oppression, income inequality, and individual\nbehavior has been claimed under the rubric of public health. Although\nall of these threats to human well-being affect health, it would be\nhard to conceptualize public health as encompassing all of the\nsocietal resources that these threats demand for their mitigation. For\nexample, while reducing violence is critical to population health,\nthat does not mean that law enforcement, the criminal justice system,\ndiplomacy and international relations should be considered tools of\npublic health.\n\nWhether or under what conditions it is ethically appropriate to frame\nor re-frame a social problem in public health terms is morally\ncomplex. For example, taking a public health rather than criminal\njustice orientation to gun violence or substance abuse can sometimes\ncontribute to defusing tensions, decreasing negative impacts on racial\nor other minority groups, and leading to better overall outcomes\n(Dorfman and Wallack 2009). At the same time, however, interventions\ngenerally outside the purview of public health institutions and\nprofessionals such as early childhood education, income supports,\nliteracy initiatives for girls, and safe housing programs all can be\neffective in preventing illness and injury. In some cases, such\ninterventions may be more effective and efficient in achieving health\ngains than paradigmatic public health programs.\n\nMorally responsible public health policy requires attentiveness to the\nmultiple determinants of health. This requirement does not signal that\npublic health has no boundaries. Rather, public health has a unique\nrelationship of stewardship to health, and to the particular\ndeterminants that have a special strategic significance for health.\nSome of those determinants are the classic focus of public health,\nsuch as infectious disease control and the securing of safe food,\nwater, and essential medications. However, exercising that stewardship\nrequires responsiveness to the best available evidence about all the\ndeterminants, across the landscape of an interconnected social\nstructure, that have a special strategic relation to health. These\ndeterminants often lie outside the conventional remits of public\nhealth agencies and authorities. Policies governing education, foreign\nassistance, agriculture, and the environment can all have a\nsignificant impact on health, just as health policies can impact\ninternational relations and national and global economies. \n\nOne worry raised by this interconnectedness across spheres of social\nlife and policy is that classifying something as a public health\nmatter could be an effective way of taking it out of the realm of\nlegitimate discussion. (Anomaly 2011; Coggon 2012) If the goal of\nprotecting public health is seen as clearly good, government actions\naimed at securing health may be less scrutinized than actions aimed at\nmore controversial ends, leaving public health officials with too much\npower and too little democratic accountability. As a practical matter,\nhowever, these concerns may not be realistic. Consider the recent\nexample of climate change. Early in 2020, the American Medical\nAssociation and 23 other health and medical organizations sent a\nletter to the President of the United States calling climate change a\npublic health emergency and declaring that \u201cthere is no single\nstep that will do more for the health of all Americans than remaining\nin and meeting our obligations to the Paris Climate Agreement.\u201d\n(Robeznieks 2020) It seems unlikely that framing climate change as a\npublic health crisis risks taking climate policy out of the realm of\nlegitimate discussion. Indeed, although data on this point are hard to\ncome by, it is likely that the reverse is true: public health agencies\nand workers are more likely to have insufficient political power,\nauthority, and resources at their disposal to achieve important and\npressing goals than to wield too much. It is not usually individuals\u2019\ncivil rights to which public health interventions stand in opposition,\nbut rather private, corporate economic interests such as the tobacco\nindustry, the meat and dairy industry, and so on. Nonetheless, it is\nworth raising these worries at least to keep them in view as a\npossible issue for public health ethics to address. And even if the\nworry that expanding the classification of something as a public\nhealth matter in some way threatens civil liberties is nothing more\nthan fear-mongering, the breadth of what falls under public health may\nraise concerns about legitimacy, concerns taken up Section 3. But\nfirst, we turn to questions about justice in public health of the sort\npresaged in our discussion of the first distinctive characteristic of\npublic health, its focus on the health of populations, not\nindividuals.\n",
