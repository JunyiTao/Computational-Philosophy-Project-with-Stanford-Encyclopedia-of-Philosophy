    "main_text": "Hippias Major\n16. Hippias Major\n\nThe authenticity of this dialogue has been questioned (see\n Section 17).\n A dialogue of definition, the Hippias Major takes up the\nsubject of the fine or beautiful (to kalon), one of the two\nmost general terms of commendation in ancient Greek, the other being\nagathon, good, nearly a synonym. Being kalon is the\nprimary feature of each of the virtues, and, by implication, the\ndialogue points to an important Socratic idea about ethics: That in\nbeing kalon a virtue is beneficial.\n\nHippias is a sophist from Elis, in the northwest corner of the\nPeloponnesus; he takes pride in being a polymath, an expert on many\nsubjects including rhetoric, history, and mathematics. The question of\ndefining to kalon arises because Hippias boasts about the\nhigh quality of a speech he will soon make, and he invites Socrates to\nattend, along with others capable of judging a speech. Socrates by\nimplication invokes the\n priority of definition:\n How can anyone judge what is fine or foul in a speech, without\nknowing what it is to be fine (286c)? \u201cFine\u201d translates\nthe Greek kalon, a general term of commendation that is often\nrendered as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201camiable,\u201d or\n\u201cnoble,\u201d but often simply means \u201cgood.\u201d Its\nopposite, aischron means \u201cugly,\u201d\n\u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201cshameful,\u201d or\n\u201cfoul.\u201d\n\nAt this point Socrates introduces a strikingly unique feature of the\ndialogue, the Questioner\u2014someone who, Socrates says, will not\nallow him to get away with claims that imply knowledge, but persists\nin asking him shame-inducing questions such as this one about defining\nto kalon. Since the Questioner meets Socrates in the privacy\nof his home, we must imagine that he is Socrates\u2019 alter ego, and\nthat the process referred to is the self-elenchus by which Socrates is\ndriven to his famous disclaimer of knowledge.\n\nThe dialogue reviews seven possible definitions, three proposed by\nHippias, and four more sophisticated ones proposed by Socrates. All\nare refuted, and the dialogue ends at an impasse (aporia), as\nis usual for works in this group.The final arguments do, nevertheless,\npoint to the idea that a good (such as a virtue, probably) can be\nbeneficial by replicating itself.\n\nHippias makes three category mistakes, one in each of his answers to\nthe question, \u201cWhat is the Fine?\u201d (287e\u2013293c) He\nidentifies three kinds of entity that can be fine\u2014a particular\n(a fine girl), a mass substance (gold), and a universal (living the\ntraditional good life). Socrates\u2019 double strategy is the same in\neach case: (1) To show that the answer fails the generality\nrequirement; it does not explain all the cases of being fine. (2) To\nshow that the fine entity to which Hippias refers is not fine in every\ncontext. This violates the exclusion requirement, for it does not\nexclude non-fine things. It also implies that the answer fails to\nsatisfy the explanation requirement; generally, to explain\nXness, something must be X no matter what (synonymy\nrequirement). If fire explains heat, that is because it is always hot;\nbut gold cannot explain fineness, because gold is not always fine; it\nis foul as material for cookware. All of these answers fail for two\nkinds of reasons: because they are merely examples of fine things, and\nbecause they identify things that are fine only in certain contexts,\nleaving unanswered the question of what makes them fine in those\ncontexts but not in others.\n\nHippias\u2019 three answers have much in common, but they range over\nthree different metaphysical types, particulars, mass substances, and\nuniversals. Hippias has attempted greater degrees of generality in his\nsecond and third answers (gold and living the good life), but the more\ngeneral answers still fail. What Socrates seeks is not so much\ngenerality as it is explanatory power.\n\nThe remaining four answers are better candidates and come (as in the\nEuthyphro) from Socrates, though in this case he attributes\nthem to the Questioner, his alter ego. They are that the fine is (1)\nthe appropriate, (2) the able, (3) the beneficial, and (4) pleasure\nthrough sight and hearing. These represent a single strategy, which\ntries to tease out the deeper meaning in the intuition that fine and\ngood things are beneficial. The appropriate and the able are\nattractive answers, but only when they are taken to imply that the\nfine is beneficial. This answer, however, leads to an odd result: if\nto be fine is to be beneficial, then the fine will be productive of\nthe good, and if it is productive of the good, then (apparently) the\nfine cannot be good, because cause and effect cannot be the same. But\nthat is unacceptable; the fine must be good. The conclusion invites us\nto ask whether a good can be beneficial in being able to replicate\nitself. (See Section 6 on\n instrumentality.)\n The last answer (pleasure through sight and hearing) attempts an\naesthetic construction of the fine, and founders on the problem of\ndisjunctive definition. \u201cWhat\u2019s fine is hard,\u201d\nSocrates concludes, resigned to being unable to judge what is fine or\nfoul in a speech until he learns what the fine is.\n",
