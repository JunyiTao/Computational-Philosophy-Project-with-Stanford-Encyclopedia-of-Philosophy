    "main_text": "Possible Contributions to Philosophy at Large || Philosophy: Wissenschaft or Way?\n5.1 Philosophy: Wissenschaft or Way?\n\nJapanese philosophy presents alternative models to today\u2019s\ncommon paradigm of philosophy as a Wissenschaft, a form of\ndetached knowing that functions as a \u201cscientific\u201d\ndiscipline within the modern academy. When Japanese philosophy\nconsiders itself a Way rather than a Wissenschaft, it\nstresses engagement over detachment. As an enterprise that may\ntransform both knower and known through a bodymind theory-praxis, that\nJapanese version of philosophy seems to parallel some aspects of\nWestern philosophy in its original, ancient Greek form which also\nemphasized loving wisdom rather than detached knowledge as well as\nknowing oneself rather than impersonal analysis. Thus, the study of\nJapanese philosophy raises not only philosophical questions, but also\nopens into metaphilosophical questions about what philosophy is,\nwhether there are different kinds of philosophy, and how different\nmodels of philosophy may interrelate.\n",
