The History of the St. Petersburg Paradox\n\nThe St. Petersburg paradox is named after one of the leading\nscientific journals of the eighteenth century, Commentarii\nAcademiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae [Papers of\nthe Imperial Academy of Sciences in Petersburg], in which Daniel\nBernoulli (1700\u20131782) published a paper entitled \u201cSpecimen\nTheoriae Novae de Mensura Sortis\u201d [\u201cExposition of a New\nTheory on the Measurement of Risk\u201d] in 1738. Daniel Bernoulli\nhad learned about the problem from his cousin Nicolaus I\n(1687\u20131759), who proposed an early but unnecessarily complex\nversion of the paradox in a letter to Pierre R\u00e9mond de Montmort\non 9 September 1713 (for this and related letters see J. Bernoulli\n1975). Nicolaus asked de Montmort to imagine an example in which an\nordinary dice is rolled until a 6 comes up:\n\n\n[W]hat is the expectation of B \u2026 if A promises to\nB to give him some coins in this progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\netc. or 1, 3, 9, 27 etc. or 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 etc. or 1, 8, 27, 64\ninstead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. as beforehand. Although for the most\npart these problems are not difficult, you will find however something\nmost curious. (N. Bernoulli to Montmort, 9 September 1713)\n\n\nIt seems that Montmort did not immediately get Nicolaus\u2019 point.\nMontmort responded that these problems \n\n\nhave no difficulty, the only concern is to find the sum of the series\nof which the numerators being in the progression of squares, cubes,\netc. the denominators are in geometric progression. (Montmort to N.\nBernoulli, 15 November 1713) \n\n\nHowever, he never performed any calculations. If he had, he would have\ndiscovered that the expected value of the first series (1, 2, 4, 8,\n16, etc.) is: \n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{5^{n-1}}{6^n}\\cdot 2^{n-1}.\n\\]\n\n\nFor this series it holds that \n\\[\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left|\\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\\right| \\gt 1,\n\\]\n\n\nso by applying the ratio test it is easy to verify that the series is\ndivergent. (This test was discovered by d\u2019Alembert in 1768, so\nit might be unfair to criticize Montmort for not seeing this.)\nHowever, the mathematical argument presented by Nicolaus himself was\nalso a bit sketchy and would not impress contemporary mathematicians.\nThe good news is that his conclusion was correct:\n\n\nit would follow thence that B must give to A an infinite sum\nand even more than infinity (if it is permitted to speak thus) in\norder that he be able to make the advantage to give him some coins in\nthis progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 etc. (N. Bernoulli to Montmort, 20\nFebruary 1714)\n\n\nThe next important contribution to the debate was made by\nCram\u00e9r in 1728. He read about Nicolaus\u2019 original problem\nin a book published by Montmort and proposed a simpler and more\nelegant formulation in a letter to Nicolaus:\n\n\nIn order to render the case more simple I will suppose that A\nthrow in the air a piece of money, B undertakes to give him a\ncoin, if the side of Heads falls on the first toss, 2, if it is only\nthe second, 4, if it is the 3rd toss, 8, if it is the 4th toss, etc.\nThe paradox consists in this that the calculation gives for the\nequivalent that A must give to B an infinite sum, which\nwould seem absurd. (Cram\u00e9r to N. Bernoulli, 21 May 1728)\n\n\nIn the very same letter, Cram\u00e9r proposed a solution that\nrevolutionized the emerging field of decision theory. Cram\u00e9r\npointed out that it is not the expected monetary value that\nshould guide the choices of a rational agent, but rather the\n\u201cusage\u201d that \u201cmen of good sense\u201d can make of\nmoney. According to Cram\u00e9r, twenty million is not worth more\nthan ten million, because ten million is enough for satisfying all\ndesires an agent may reasonably have:\n\n\nmathematicians value money in proportion to its quantity, and men of\ngood sense in proportion to the usage that they may make of it. That\nwhich renders the mathematical expectation infinite, is the prodigious\nsum that I am able to receive, if the side of Heads falls only very\nlate, the 100th or 1000th toss. Now this sum, if I reason as a\nsensible man, is not more for me, does not make more pleasure for me,\ndoes not engage me more to accept the game, than if it would be only\n10 or 20 million coins. (21 May 1728)\n\n\nThe point made by Cram\u00e9r in this passage can be generalized.\nSuppose that the upper boundary of an outcome\u2019s value is\n\\(2^m.\\) If so, that outcome will be obtained if the coin lands heads\non the mth flip. This means that the expected value\nof all the infinitely many possible outcomes in which the\ncoin is flipped more than m times will be finite: It is \\(2^m\\)\ntimes the probability that this happens, so it cannot exceed \\(2^m\\).\nTo this we have to add the aggregated value of the first m\npossible outcomes, which is obviously finite. Because the sum of any\ntwo finite numbers is finite, the expected value of\nCram\u00e9r\u2019s version of the St. Petersburg game is\nfinite.\n\nCram\u00e9r was aware that it would be controversial to claim that\nthere exists an upper boundary beyond which additional riches do not\nmatter at all. However, he pointed out that his solution\nworks even if he the value of money is strictly increasing but the\nrelative increase gets smaller and smaller (21 May 1728): \n\n\nIf one wishes to suppose that the moral value of goods was as the\nsquare root of the mathematical quantities \u2026 my moral\nexpectation will be \n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{1} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\sqrt{4} + \\frac{1}{16} \\cdot \\sqrt{8} \\ldots \n  \\]\n\n\n\nThis is the first clear statement of what contemporary decision\ntheorists and economists refer to as decreasing marginal utility: The\nadditional utility of more money is never zero, but the richer you\nare, the less you gain by increasing your wealth further.\nCram\u00e9r correctly calculated the expected utility (\u201cmoral\nvalue\u201d) of the St. Petersburg game to be about 2.9 units for an\nagent whose utility of money is given by the root function.\n\nDaniel Bernoulli proposed a very similar idea in his famous 1738\narticle mentioned at the beginning of this section. Daniel argued that\nthe agent\u2019s utility of wealth equals the logarithm of the\nmonetary amount, which entails that improbable but large monetary\nprizes will contribute less to the expected utility of the game than\nmore probable but smaller monetary amounts. As his article was about\nto be published, Daniel\u2019s brother Nicolaus mentioned to him that\nCram\u00e9r had proposed a very similar idea in 1728 (in the letter\nquoted above). In the final version of the text, Daniel openly\nacknowledged this: \n\n\nIndeed I have found [Cram\u00e9r\u2019s] theory so similar to mine\nthat it seems miraculous that we independently reached such close\nagreement on this sort of subject.
