    "main_text": "The specious present\n4. The specious present\n\nThe term \u2018specious present\u2019 was first introduced by the\npsychologist E.R. Clay, but the best known characterisation of it was\ndue to William James, widely regarded as one of the founders of modern\npsychology. He lived from 1842 to 1910, and was professor both of\npsychology and of philosophy at Harvard. His definition of the\nspecious present goes as follows: \u2018the prototype of all\nconceived times is the specious present, the short duration of which\nwe are immediately and incessantly sensible\u2019 (James 1890). How\nlong is this specious present? Elsewhere in the same work, James\nasserts \u2018We are constantly aware of a certain duration\u2014the\nspecious present\u2014varying from a few seconds to probably not more\nthan a minute, and this duration (with its content perceived as having\none part earlier and another part later) is the original intuition of\ntime.\u2019 This surprising variation in the length of the specious\npresent makes one suspect that more than one definition is hidden in\nJames\u2019 rather vague characterisation. \n\nThere are two sources of ambiguity here. One is over whether\n\u2018the specious present\u2019 refers to the object of the\nexperience, namely a duration in time, or the way in which that object\nis presented to us. The second is over how we should interpret\n\u2018immediately sensible\u2019. James\u2019 words suggest that\nthe specious present is the duration itself, picked out as the object\nof a certain kind of experience. But \u2018 immediately\nsensible\u2019admits of a number of disambiguations. So we could\ndefine the specious present as:\n\nthe span of short-term memory;\nthe duration which is perceived, not as duration, but as\ninstantaneous;\nthe duration which is directly perceived \u2014 i.e. not through\nthe intermediary of a number of other, perhaps instantaneous,\nperceptions;\nthe duration which is perceived both as present and as extended in\ntime.\n\n\nIf James means the first of these, that would certainly explain his\nsuggestion that it could last up to a minute. But this does not seem\nto have much to do specifically with the experience of\npresentness, since we can certainly hold something in the\nshort-term memory and yet recognise it as past. James may be thinking\nof cases where we are listening to a sentence: if we did not somehow\nhold all the words in our conscious mind, we would not understand the\nsentence as a whole. But it is clear that the words are not\nexperienced as simultaneous, for then the result would be an\nunintelligible jumble of sounds. (2) is illustrated by the familiar\nfact that some movements are so fast that we see them as a blur, such\nas when we look at a fan. What is in fact taking place at different\ntimes is presented as happening in an instant. But this is not\nstandardly what is meant by the specious present. (3) is a construal\nthat is found in the literature (see, e.g., Kelly 2005), but it is not\nobvious that that is what James had in mind, since James is concerned\nwith the phenomenology of time perception, and whether or not an\nexperience constitutes a direct or indirect perception of an interval\ndoes not seem to be a phenomenological matter. (Besides which, as\nKelly points out, we might think it odd to suppose that past parts of\nthe interval could be directly perceived.)\n\nThat leaves us with (4): a duration which is perceived both as present\nand as temporally extended. This present of experience is\n\u2018specious\u2019 in that, unlike the objective present (if there\nis such a thing \u2014 see\n The metaphysics of time perception\n below) it is an interval and not a durationless instant. The real or\nobjective present must be durationless for, as Augustine argued, in an\ninterval of any duration, there are earlier and later parts. So if any\npart of that interval is present, there will be another part that is\npast or future.\n\nBut is it possible to perceive something as extended and as present? If\nwe hear a short phrase of music, we seem to hear the phrase as\npresent, and yet \u2014 because it is a phrase rather than a single\nchord \u2014 we also hear the notes as successive, and therefore as\nextending over an interval. If this does not seem entirely convincing,\nconsider the perception of motion. As Broad (1923) puts it, \u2018to\nsee a second-hand moving is quite a different thing from \"seeing\" that\na hour-hand has moved.\u2019 It is not that we see the current\nposition of the second hand and remember where it was a second ago: we\njust see the motion. That leads to the following argument:\n\n\n(1) What we perceive, we perceive as present.\n\n\n(2) We perceive motion. \n\n(3) Motion occurs over an interval. \n\nTherefore: What we perceive as present occurs over an interval. \n\n\nStill, there is more than an air of paradox about this. If successive\nparts of the motion (or musical phrase, or whatever change we\nperceive) are perceived as present, then surely they are perceived as\nsimultaneous. But if they are perceived as simultaneous, then the\nmotion will simply be a blur, as it is in cases where it is too fast\nto perceive as motion. The fact that we do not see it as motion\nsuggests that we do not see the successive parts of it as\nsimultaneous, and so do not see them as present. But then how do we\nexplain the distinction to which Broad directs our attention?\n\nOne way out of this impasse is to suggest that two quite distinct\nprocesses are going on in the perception of motion (and other kinds of\nchange). One is the perception of successive states as successive, for\nexample the different positions of the second hand. The other is the\nperception of pure movement. This second perception, which may involve\na more primitive system than the first, does not contain as part the\nrecognition of earlier and later elements. (Le Poidevin 2007, Chapter\n5.) Alternatively, we might attempt to explain the phenomena of temporal experience without appeal to the notion of the specious present at all (see Arstila, 2018).\n",
