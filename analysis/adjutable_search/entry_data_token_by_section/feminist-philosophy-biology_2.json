These objectives include (1)\nrevealing gender bias in biological accounts of sex and gender, (2)\nanalyzing science as a social, value-laden practice and (3) exploring\nhow the social and material situation of biologists affects knowledge\nproduction.\n\nBias. The largest body of work in feminist philosophy of\nbiology concerns revealing and eliminating sexist and androcentric\nbias. Central and early work in the field documented the presence of\nassumptions of female passivity and male activity in a wide range of\nbiological accounts of sex and gender. Examples include critique of\nresearch on sex determination (Birke 1986, Bleier 1984), fertilization\n(Martin 1991), human evolution (Bleier 1984, Fausto-Sterling\n1985/1992, Hubbard 1990) and the discipline of primatology (Hrdy 1986,\n1997, and Haraway 1989). More recently, Elisabeth Lloyd (1993, 2005)\nhas studied biological explanations of women's orgasm. She\ndemonstrates that these accounts often rely on two false assumptions,\nassumptions that involve (1) presupposing that these explanations need to\nbe based on natural selection and (2) presupposing a tight link\nbetween women's sexuality and reproduction. Feminist research on\nsexist bias in biology focuses on eliminating myths of female biology\nthat are colored by contemporary social values and facilitating the\nproduction of biological research that more accurately reveals the\nfacts about sex and gender. In this sense a feminist perspective is\nseen as a sort of control, with the goal of removing gender bias,\ni.e., sexist and androcentric social values, from scientific\nresearch. For example, The Biology and Gender Study Group (1988,\n61\u201362) write that,\n\n\nWe have come to look at feminist critique as we would any other\nexperimental control. Whenever one performs an experiment, one\nsets up all the controls one can think of in order to make as certain\nas possible that the result obtained does not come from any other\nsource. One asks oneself what assumptions one is making. Have I\nassumed the temperature to be constant? Have I assumed that the pH\ndoesn't change over the time of the reaction? Feminist critique\nasks if there may be some assumptions that we haven't checked\nconcerning gender bias. In this way feminist critique should be\npart of normative science. Like any control, it seeks to provide\ncritical rigor, and to ignore this critique is to ignore a possible\nsource of error.\n\n\n\nThe Biology and Gender Study Group (BGSG) point out that old models\nof sex determination simply assumed that female developmental patterns\nwere neutral and passive, while male developmental patterns required\nsome sort of active switch to initiate their development (1988).\nThe BGSG refer with approval to the 1980's work of Eva Eicher and\nLinda Washburn, who created a developmental model that did not make the\nsexist assumption of female passivity and was based on genetic\nevidence. In this model both male and female development had\npassive and active components. Further, Eicher and Washburn demonstrate\nthat although there had been significant research on testes\ndetermination, there had been practically no work on ovary\ndetermination. As a result of this androcentrism, claims about\nthe passivity of female sexual development were made in the absence of\nevidence. The BGSG sees Eicher and Washburn as an example of a\nfeminist-influenced critique of cell and molecular biology because they\ncontrolled for gender bias. This allowed them to be \u201copen to\ndifferent interpretations of one's data\u201d and gave them\n\u201cthe ability to ask questions that would not have occurred within\nthe traditional context\u201d (68).\n\n\nA focus on bias is only one of several epistemic approaches within\nfeminist philosophy of biology. Sarah Richardson (2010), while\npointing out the value of case studies of gender bias, is critical of\ntendencies to focus solely on revealing and removing bias. She\npoints out that there is institutional pressure to work on bias:\n\u201cwithin philosophy of science as a whole, the most central and\nwidely-accepted philosophical question related to gender in science is\nthe issue of gender bias in science.\u201d Richardson argues that\nbecause it is customary in the philosophy of science to see good\nscience as value neutral, analyses of bias fall clearly within a\ntraditional philosophical approach. However, even in the face of\nthese professional incentives, she argues that a primary or sole focus\non bias is a limiting epistemic position. It is limited because\nit fails to take into account feminist work, in epistemology and\nphilosophy of science, that considers how values, including\ngender values, not only limit but also facilitate knowledge\nproduction. Such an account complicates the traditional view that\nvalues should be identified solely in order to guard against their\nimpact and leads to a second epistemic perspective, analyses of science\nas a social value-laden practice.\n\nScience as a social value-laden practice. Helen\nLongino has developed an influential social account of scientific\nknowledge production, critical contextual empiricism (1990,\n2002). Her development of this view is informed by her early work\nwith Ruth Doell (1983) on a case study of biological models of the role\nof hormones in the development of sexual behavior. Longino points out\nthat there is an inferential gap between a theory and the evidence\nresearchers use to assess that theory. Longino argues that researchers\nclose the gap between evidence and theories with background assumptions\nof which they may not be aware. Background assumptions include\nboth epistemic and contextual values, and contextual values can include\ngendered social values. She argues that scientific communities maximize\nobjectivity and justification when they (1) include members who differ\nfrom one another in terms of the background assumptions they hold and\n(2) take dissenting views seriously. Critical discourse among\nthose who hold assumptions that differ from one another improves\njustification or objectivity because it can facilitate researchers\nbecoming aware of and critically evaluating the background assumptions\n(including those that are sexist and androcentric) that inform their\nresearch practices. Communities can then decide whether or not\nthose assumptions are acceptable given their research goals. Using\nexamples including sex differences in human evolution, behavioral\nendocrinology and neurobiology, Longino demonstrates that gendered\nassumptions structure a range of research programs in biology.\nShe writes \u201cThe long standing devaluation of women's voices\nand those of members of racial minorities means that such [racist and\nsexist] assumptions have been protected from critical scrutiny\u201d\n(1990, 78\u201379). The implication is that these racist and sexist\nassumptions, had they received critical scrutiny, would have been\ndeemed unacceptable.\n\nSituated knowledge. Donna Haraway coined the term\n\u2018situated knowledge\u2019, this view has become very influential\nin academic feminism, including feminist epistemology. In her\nbook Primate Visions (1989) she explores the ways that\nprimatology constructs political narratives about the categories of\nnature, gender, and race, and the ways that those categories are\nintegrated with particular perspectives situated in social and material\nlocations. She also reveals the ways that feminist primatologists\nhave turned primatology into what some call a feminist science.\n\n\nIn Haraway's account of situated knowledge, the knowing\nsubject, including the biologist, is embodied, meaning that one has a\nparticular material and social location (for example one's\nlocation can include being a woman, feminist, scientist, Anglo\nAmerican, heterosexual,\u2026). As a result Haraway argues that\nit is illusory to think that there is an impartial view from\nnowhere. Because of particularities of material and social\nlocation, the perspective(s) from which we know and the knowledge we\nproduce are partial. According to Haraway, objectivity involves\nnot only describing the world as faithfully as one can, but also\nacknowledging the particularities of one's perspective and being\nresponsible for the partial perspective (chosen from the multitude of\nfeatures of our location) that we employ. Haraway argues\nthat there is a multitude of ways for dividing the world into objects\nand categories. One's perspective does not just influence\none's interests, the questions one asks and the methods, theories\nand strategies that one uses to answer those questions; it also\ninfluences one's ontology, in terms of the objects and kinds of\nthings that one investigates. The job of achieving objectivity then\nbecomes one of negotiating or translating what we know across different\nsubject locations, which can include different political, epistemic and\nontological commitments.\n\n\nHaraway's account of feminist primatologists shows not only\nthat a partial (as opposed to impartial) feminist perspective was\nproductive in terms of asking new questions, of illuminating new\nobjects and categories of objects, and developing new theories.\nIt also shows that what, at the time, were more mainstream perspectives\nwere, as all viewpoints, also partial. If those more mainstream\nviews seemed impartial, it was because those who held them had long\npossessed institutional and social power such that they did not need to\nconsider the alternatives and because the discipline had previously\nexcluded many who held different partial perspectives.\n\n\nWe can see situated knowledge in Jeanne Altmann's working from\nthe perspective of a woman, a mother, and a feminist to develop\nmethodologies that allowed for the systematic study of the often\nlow-drama interactions among female primates and between mothers and\ntheir offspring, which were previously not salient to\nresearchers. Another example from Primate Visions (1989)\nis Adrienne Zihlman's critique of associations of sexual\ndimorphism with, usually male, dominance. Zihlman, who is best known\nfor her development, with Nancy Tanner, of Woman the Gatherer theory of\nearly human evolution, consciously developed a feminist stance toward\ngender and science. Zihlman argued that sexual dimorphism was not\na unitary phenomenon. Different species can be sexually dimorphic\nnot only to different degrees, but in different ways, including bone\nlength and structure, tendencies to build muscle or fat tissue, and/or\ncanine size. These different kinds of sexual dimorphism can be\nrelated to differences in aggressive capacities and differences in\nforaging strategies, both of which had been associated with\nevolutionary accounts of gender differences. Zihlman's\nstance as a feminist scientist allowed her to focus on heterogeneity\nand complexity, which made generalizations about sexual dimorphism\nhighly problematic and undermined associations of general sexual\ndimorphism with male dominance.\n\n\nAs discussed in this section, epistemic perspectives in feminist\nphilosophy of biology range across work on gender bias, considerations\nof biology a social and value-laden practice, and Haraway's\ndevelopment and use of the idea of situated knowledge.\n",
