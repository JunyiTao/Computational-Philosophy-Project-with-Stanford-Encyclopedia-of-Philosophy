    "main_text": "Egalitarianism and Justice || Relational Egalitarianism\n6.3 Relational Egalitarianism\n\nWe have seen that equality can sometimes be understood as required by\njustice; but it can also be valued independently. Indeed there can be\ncircumstances in which the two values collide, because what justice\ndemands is inequality of outcome. The kind of inequality that is\nindependently valuable is social equality, best understood as a\nproperty of the relationships that prevail within a society: people\nregard and treat each other as social equals, and the society\u2019s\ninstitutions are designed to foster and reflect such attitudes. A\nsociety of equals contrasts with one in which people belong to\ndifferent ranks in a social hierarchy, and behave towards one another\nas their relative ranking prescribes. Different reasons can be given\nfor objecting to social inequality, and conversely for valuing social\nequality (see Scanlon 2003).\n\nThose who find equality valuable for reasons other than reasons of\ndistributive justice are often described as \u2018relational\negalitarians\u2019 (see Anderson 1999, Wolff 1998, Fourie, Schuppert\nand Wallimann-Helmer 2015). It is tempting to regard relational\negalitarianism as a rival theory of justice to the luck egalitarian\ntheory outlined in \u00a76.2, but it may be more illuminating to see\nit instead as providing an alternative account of why we should care\nabout limiting material inequality. Thus, faced with a world like the\none we currently inhabit in which income differences are very large,\njustice theorists are likely to criticize these inequalities on\ngrounds that they are not deserved, or arise from brute luck, etc.,\nwhereas relational egalitarians will say that they create a divided\nsociety in which people are alienated from each other, and cannot\ninteract in a mutually respectful way. Relational equality does not\naddress issues of distribution directly, and so cannot function as a\ntheory of justice itself, but it can provide grounds for preferring\none theory of justice to its rivals \u2013 namely that implementing\nthat particular theory is more likely to create or sustain a society\nof equals.\n",
