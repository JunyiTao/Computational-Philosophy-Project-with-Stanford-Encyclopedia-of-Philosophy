    "main_text": "The ultimate question: is reality directed?\n7. Institutionalization\n\nProcess thought constituted a prominent sector of the active\nphilosophical scene in the USA during the first half of the 20th\ncentury. Apart from the proliferation of books and articles on the\ntopic, it has achieved considerable institutionalization in the USA\nduring the years after World War II. Indications of this phenomenon\ninclude the formation of the Society for Process Studies, as\nwell as the prominence of process philosophizing within the aegis of\nthe Society for American Philosophy and the American\nMetaphysical Society. Another clear token is the journal\nProcess Studies, published by the Center for Process\nStudies in Claremont CA, and founded in 1971 by Lewis S. Ford and\nJohn B. Cobb, Jr., a publication that has become a major vehicle for\narticle-length discussions in the field. Representatives of process\nphilosophy occupy influential posts in departments of philosophy and\nof religious studies in many of American universities and colleges,\nand some half-dozen doctoral dissertations are produced annually in\nthis field. But contemporary process philosophy is not geographically\nconfined. In 2002, the publishing house Ontos in Frankfurt, Germany,\nlaunched a book series on \u201cProcess Thought\u201d; though taken\nover by DeGruyter in 2015, over 25 volumes have appeared. In Europe\nthe Center for Practical Philosophy at the Universit\u00e9\ndu Louvain, Belgium, directed by Michel Weber, is a focal point for\nresearch on, and applications of, international process philosophy.\nThe Bulgarian Academy of Science recently created a Center for\nProcess Studies for philosophers and computer scientists. The\nGerman Whitehead Society regularly organizes conferences and\nsummer schools on both Whiteheadian and non-Whiteheadian process\nthought. The International Process Network, recently launched\nby Mark Dibben at the University of Tasmania, Australia, is a new web\ncommunity of international process philosophers of all philosophical\nproveniences East and West. Even though process philosophy is not\ninstitutionalized as such everywhere in the global field of\nphilosophy, it is a research paradigm that currently is in use all\naround the world.\n",
