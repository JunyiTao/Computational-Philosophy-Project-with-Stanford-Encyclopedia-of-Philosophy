Important Daoist Concepts\n\nSome important concepts that have played a role in the doctrines of\nDaoism are: \n\n9.1 Dao and de : The Ethical Concepts\n\n9.1.1 Dao (Way, Guide, Road)\n9.1.2 De (Virtuosity, Virtue, Power)\n \n9.2 Ming (Name)\n9.3 Chang (Constant)\n9.4 Wei & wu-wei (Deeming Action & Non-deeming Action)\n9.5 Pusimplicity (Pre-linguistic Purity)\n\n9.1 Dao and de: The Ethical Concepts\n9.1.1 Dao (Way, Guide, Road) \u9053\n\nDaoism has a reputation of being impenetrable mainly because of its\ncentral concept, dao. Yet surprisingly, the almost universal\ntranslation in English uses one of the smallest, simplest, most\nfamiliar and least consciously noticed terms of the\nlanguage\u2014\u2018way.\u2019 This common translation,\n\u2018way\u2019, is apt in several ways. Dao (Tao) is a\npivotal concept of ancient Chinese thought. \u2018Way\u2019 is\nsimilarly primitive (it resists analytic definition). We can only\noffer synonyms: e.g., \u2018course\u2019, \u2018method\u2019,\n\u2018manner\u2019, \u2018mode\u2019, \u2018style\u2019,\n\u2018means\u2019, \u2018practice\u2019, \u2018fashion\u2019,\n\u2018technique\u2019 and so on. We discover the circularity when we\ntry to analyze one of the synonyms without recourse to the term\n\u2018way\u2019 with which we began.\n\nThe partial synonyms, however, remind us of a second way in which\n\u2018way\u2019 is an apt translation of dao. A way is the\nanswer to a \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhat-to-do\u201d question. We\ntypically use talk of ways in advising someone. Ways are deeply\npractical (i.e., prescriptive or normative). \n\nDao is also used concretely to refer to a road or path in Chinese,\ne.g., Queen\u2019s Road. Again, \u2018way\u2019 fits this metaphorical\nrole\u2014as in highway and Broadway. In figurative\nEnglish use they are interchangeable\u2014the road/way to salvation.\nRoads guide us and facilitate our arrival at a desired destination.\nThey are, as it were, physically real guiding or\nprescriptive structures.\n\nThough practical, describing something as a dao or a way need\nnot be to recommend it. The Zhuangzi reminds us that thievery\nhas a dao . We can use both dao and\n\u2018way\u2019 mainly to describe\u2014as when a Confucian\nundertakes to pursue his father\u2019s dao for three years after\nhis death or we say \u201cI saw the way you did that.\u201d \n\nThere are interesting differences between dao and\n\u2018way\u2019. Chinese nouns lack pluralization, so dao\nfunctions grammatically like a singular or mass term and semantically\nlike a plural. The first tempts translators to render all occurrences\nas \u201cthe way.\u201d One is better advised to treat\ndao as a collective noun\u2014as the part-whole sum of ways.\nWhat we think of as one way would be one\npart of dao. \n\nWe partition dao by modification. So we can talk about, e.g.,\nmy-dao, Sage-King\u2019s-dao, natural-dao,\npast-time\u2019s-dao and so forth. This feature explains why\ndao appears more metaphysical than \u2018way\u2019 and\ninvites the familiar Daoist spatial metaphors like \u201chumans\ninteract in dao as fish do in water\u201d (Zhuangzi\nCh. 6). Dao is a little like the\nwater\u2014an expanse constituting the realm in which humans live,\nwork and play. To be human is to be in a realm of ways to guide us.\nDaoists are more likely to play with these metaphysical metaphors than\nare Confucians or Mohists\u2014who mainly point to (their favored\npart of) dao. \n\nAnother difference is that while both dao and\n\u2018way\u2019 are almost ineliminable terms in their respective\nlanguages, We have hardly noticed the word \u2018way\u2019 in\nphilosophy. It\u2019s barely visible in the history of Western\nphilosophy\u2014more like a bit of grammatical filler. Western\nphilosophers have endlessly analyzed and dissected a cluster of terms\nthought to be central to our thinking, e.g., \u2018good\u2019,\n\u2018right\u2019, \u2018being\u2019 (to be), \u2018know\u2019,\n\u2018believe\u2019, \u2018true\u2019, \u2018beautiful\u2019,\n\u2018reason\u2019, \u2018change\u2019, \u2018subject\u2019,\n\u2018mind\u2019, \u2018meaning\u2019, \u2018refer\u2019,\n\u2018object\u2019, \u2018property\u2019, and so forth. Some\ntrends have focused on sub-types and partial counterparts like\n\u2018methods\u2019, \u2018modes\u2019, \u2018practices\u2019,\n\u2018manners\u2019, \u2018plans\u2019 and in some sense even\n\u2018forms\u2019. Yet one looks in vain to find a Western\nphilosopher showering her analytic attention on the more general\nconcept of \u2018way\u2019. \n\nDao, by contrast, was the center of Chinese\nphilosophical discussion. It occupies the position at the center of\nthought that in Western philosophy is filled by terms like\n\u2018being\u2019 or \u2018truth\u2019. The centrality tempts\ninterpreters to identify dao with the central concepts of the\nWestern philosophical agenda, but that is to lose the important\ndifference between the two traditions. Metaphysics and epistemology\ndominated early Western philosophy while ethics, politics and\nphilosophy of education/psychology dominated Chinese thought. Although\nit\u2019s insightful to say humans live in dao as fish do in\nwater, the insight is lost if we simply treat dao as being or\nsome pantheistic spiritual realm. Dao remains essentially a\nconcept of guidance, a prescriptive or normative term. In the late\nClassical period, dao paired with devirtuosity\nto form the Chinese term for\n\u2018ethics\u2019 \u201cdao-de.\u201d Dao is\nthe pivot of Chinese philosophy\u2014but it still translates as\n\u2018way\u2019, not \u2018being\u2019.\n\nA third difference is that unlike \u2018way\u2019, dao may\nbe used as a verb. The best known example is the famous first line of\nthe Daode Jing. Literally \u201cdao can be\ndao not constant dao.\u201d For the dao in\nthe middle of the three daos in the passage, roughly one out\nof three translators uses \u2018speak\u2019, another third use\n\u2018tell\u2019 and the rest use near synonyms such as\n\u2018expressed\u2019, \u201cdefined in words\u201d, or\n\u2018stated\u2019. In a famous Confucian example of this use,\nConfucius criticizes dao-ing the people with laws rather than\ndao-ing them with ritual. (This verbal sense is now often\nmarked by a graphic variation daoto\ndirect).\n\nThroughout classical texts, we find that daos are spoken,\nheard, forgotten, transmitted, learned, studied, understood and\nmisunderstood, distorted, mastered, and performed with pleasure.\nDifferent countries and historical periods have different\ndao. Footprints of the linguistic component of the concept of\ndao are scattered through all kinds of modern Chinese\ncompound words. \u2018Preach\u2019 is jiang-dao\u2014speak a\ndao. To know is to know a dao. The character\ndao is part of compounds translated as\n\u2018doctrine\u2019, \u2018truth\u2019, \u2018principle\u2019,\n\u2018law\u2019 and of course, \u2018morality\u2019 or\n\u2018ethics\u2019, \u2018reason\u2019, \u2018religion\u2019,\n\u2018philosophy\u2019, \u2018orthodoxy\u2019,\n\u2018thank\u2019, \u2018apologize\u2019, \u2018tell\u2019,\n\u2018explain\u2019, \u2018inform\u2019 and so on. \n\nIs \u2018speak\u2019 the right way to translate these verbal uses of\ndao? It is in some ways too narrow and in others too broad.\nWe can write, gesture, point, and exemplify as well as speak\ndaos. On the other hand, not all speaking (writing etc.) is\ndao-ing\u2014particularly not if we think of language as\ndescribing, representing, picturing, expressing, defining, or\n\u201ccapturing\u201d some reality. The Chinese verbal use, is more\naccurately translated normatively as \u201cto guide\u201d, \u201cto\nrecommend, advocate, acknowledge, endorse\u201d, etc. The activity of\ndao-ing is primarily normative: giving guidance. To\ndao is to put guidance into language\u2014including body\nlanguage (e.g. pointing as meaning something in our \u201cform of\nlife.\u201d) \n\nConsider, again, the concrete translation for dao:\n\u2018road\u2019 or \u2018path\u2019. A woodsman with an ax\ndaos when he chops bark from the trees as he enters the\nforest; He is dao-ing when \u201cblazing\u201d the trail.\nWe grasp this concept best if we resist treating roads as simple\nnatural objects\u2014they are, like the woodman\u2019s blazes, akin to\ntexts that we \u201cread\u201d for guidance as we proceed that\nway. Roads or paths are embodied in a physical\nreality, but are not simply the reality. They are objectively real\nnormative structures that guide or invite us to \u201cpass this\nway\u201d. \n\nOne feature that dao and speech share is the need for\ninterpretation. But with dao the interpretation takes the\nform of xingwalk:conduct,\nnot that of a theory or a belief. In this respect, the relevant notion\nof interpretation is aesthetic. It is the kind of interpretation done\nwhen a conductor interprets a score, an actor a character in a play, a\nsoldier his orders in the course of battle. A complete metaphysics of\ndao requires a distinction between normative way\ntypes and interpretive, real-time tokens . Daoist\ntheory does introduces the tokens most dramatically with Shen Dao who\nfocuses on what he calls Great Dao\u2014the actual history of the\nworld past, present and future. That image draws our attention to a\npurely descriptive way\u2014a way that is not a (normative) way (not\na guide). \n\nTo talk, however, about a way of interpreting a way, is to remind\nourselves of Zhuangzi\u2019s point. That we can never free normative ways\nfrom ways of choosing and interpreting them. In selecting it from the\nalternative \u201cinvitations\u201d open to us, and then in\ninterpreting in our actual \u201cwalking\u201d we always rely on\nsome higher-order dao to justify our choice and execution of\nit. We are in a sea of dao. \n\nBesides the Great Dao (the actual history of the universe),\nwe can speak of tiannature:sky\ndaos, which are\nalso descriptive. Daos that advise us to accept or live by\nour nature, in effect, choose among equally natural daos.\nSince we have natural ways to reform or compensate for our natures.\nAny dao we can choose or interpret is natural in the sense\nthat it has for us at the time some physical realization\u2014sound\nwaves or pixels on a computer screen. All daos available for\nchoice or recommendation are natural. If determinism is true, the\nGreat Dao is the only tiannature:sky\ndao and every available\ndao for normative choice is a proper part of Great Dao. \n9.1.2 De (Virtuosity, Virtue, Power) \u5fb7\n\nA Daoist formula for de is \u201cdao within.\u201d\nIt may be the result of innate skill or of careful cultivation and\ntraining. Translators most commonly use \u201cvirtue\u201d as a\ntranslation but hurry to remind us that it is \u2018virtue\u2019 in\nthe ancient Greek sense of an excellence. \u2018Power\u2019 is an\nalternative translation that reflects the link between de and\nsuccessful action or achievement for its possessor. Given our use of\nan aesthetic conception of interpretation of dao, we may\nthink of one\u2019s de as her \u2018virtuosity\u2019. Virtuosity\nexhibits itself in a performer by making his\n\u201cinterpretation\u201d of the thing performed (a ceremony, chant\nor ritual) work in the context. Thus de links dao\nwith correct performance. This elegantly blends in the perceived\novertones of \u201cpower\u201d in the form of the performer\u2019s\nability to respond to clues in the context that make the performance\n\u201cwork.\u201d The \u201cpowerful\u201d performance achieves\nthe dao\u2019s goal in real time.\n9.2 Ming (Name) \u540d\n\nThe character mingnames\nreally includes all words. Grammatically, Chinese common nouns share\nmore features with proper names and one-place predicates (transitive\nverbs and adjectives) than do familiar Indo-European nouns. Chinese\ncommon nouns lack case and gender markings and Chinese grammar\nrequires no grammatical noun-verb agreement. Like mass nouns, Chinese\ncommon nouns do not undergo pluralization and can stand alone as noun\nphrases. For related reasons, Chinese analysis postulated no\nsubstance-attribute structure to adjective-noun relations. So the\ntranslation \u2018name\u2019 is not inept nor is the ancient Chinese\ntheory assumption that all words name the part of reality which the\nword \u201cpicks out\u201d\u2014roughly \u201cnaming\u201d what\nwe think of as its denotation or scope. Thus \u2018white\u2019 is a\nname and \u2018horse\u2019 is a name. Each names a region\nor part of the world. \n\nThe most familiar statement of a widely shared implicit theory of\nnames in ancient China is expressed beautifully in the Daode\nJing. Call it the \u201ccontrast theory\u201d of names. It\ntreats all words (norms or values) as \u201ccoming with\u201d a\ncomplement, converse or opposite. To learn and understand a word is to\nknow what is and what is not picked out by it. In the Daode\nJing, the theory lends itself to a linguistic idealist\ninterpretation. Names literally \u201ccreate\u201d things. This line\nof interpretation informs the \u201cchaos\u201d interpretation of\nDaoist metaphysics in which reality is an undifferentiated stuff which\nhumans divide into \u201cthings\u201d by the use of\nmingnames. \n\nAn interesting near homonym is mingcommand-fate\nwhich was routinely used as a\nverbal form of mingnames.\nThe familiar practice is to translate it as either\n\u2018command\u2019 (reminding us of the Chinese view that the role\nof language and names is guiding and coordinating behavior) or as\n\u2018fate\u2019. Another meaning-related near homonym is\nmingdiscerning:clear.\n9.3 Chang (Constant, Eternal) \u5e38\n\nThere is less controversy about the meaning of\nchangconstant, but its uses\nand importance in Chinese thought are not well understood. We can\nbetter appreciate the uses of changconstant\nin ancient Chinese by analogy with\ncausal and reliability theories in epistemology and semantics. Hu Shih\nspeculated that in this use, changconstant\nresembled a pragmatic conception of\n\u2018true\u2019. He pointed to a related use in the Mozi\nwhich advocates that we should changconstant\nlanguage that promotes [good?]\nbehavior. This quasi-imperative use underlies its role in Daoist\nrelativistic and skeptical analysis. The Daode Jing has the\nmost famous example of its use in the parallel opening couplet where\nit modifies both dao and mingnames.\n\n\nMohist use of the concept is instructive.\nTiannature:sky is a\nparadigm of constancy. The Mohists alluded to its regularity and\nuniversality to contrast with the temporary and local authority of\nsocial conventions and guidance by authority. They cast their\ndisagreement with Confucians in terms of who offered a constant\ndao. This seems to bridge three measures of constancy. \n\nA constant dao should apply equally to people of all\ncultures, times, and levels of social development. \nA constant dao should be operationally\nunambiguous\u2014like measurements operations. Its interpretation\ninto action should not invite variability. \nA constant dao should be consistent with natural\ntendencies; it should reinforce and draws reinforcement from them\nrather than encounter resistance in practice. \n\n\nDaoists, as the Laozi famously puts it, suggest that any\ndao that can dao (guide or be used as a guide) will\nnot be a constant dao. It follows this claim with a parallel\nclaims about mingnames. Any\nname that can name is an inconstant name. This is arguably offered as\nthe explanation of the inconstancy of dao asserted in the earlier\nsentence. \n9.4 Wei & Wu-wei (Deeming Action & Non-deeming Action) \u7121\u70ba\n\nLaozi\u2019s famous slogan has puzzled interpreters for centuries and has\ngiven rise to numerous analyses. The first character is not the main\nproblem. Wu is simply \u201cdoes not exist.\u201d In this\nphrase, however, interpreters treat it as a negative prescription:\n\u201cavoid wei.\u201d The harder problem is to understand\nwei.\n\nIn modern Mandarin, the character has two different tones. The fourth\ntone reading is usually translated as \u201cfor the sake of.\u201d\nIn the second tone reading, the character would normally be translated\nas \u2018to act\u2019. Textbook interpretations say wei\nmeans \u2018purpose\u2019 as well as \u2018action\u2019, so the\nslogan means \u201cnon-purposive action.\u201d The second tone\nreading, however, has another important use. Some grammar textbooks\ncall it the putative sense\u2014\u201cto deem, regard or\ninterpret.\u201d Wei functions in this sense in Literary\nChinese belief ascriptions which focus on the predicate. So a belief\nthat S is P takes the de re form [believer] takes S to be\n(wei) P. Wei also figures in a related way in\nknowledge contexts with nominal predicates\u2014\u201cknow to deem\nas (wei) [noun].\u201d \n\nAncient Chinese has several meaning-related homonyms, including weiis-only,\nweito\nbe called, and weiartificial.\nThe latter adds a\n\u2018human\u2019 radical to weido:deem.\nTypical translations of this character\ninclude \u2018artificial\u2019 or \u2018false\u2019. The cluster\nof concepts correspond to the pivotal Daoist contrast between\ntian (nature) and ren (the human). Wei is\nsomething done by human conceptualizing rather than something\n\u201cnatural.\u201d If we include this content in our explanation\nof Laozi\u2019s use of wei, we can explain its role more fully\nthan does the theory on acts while lacking \u2018purpose\u2019 or\ndeliberation. Little in the Laozi (or earlier Chinese\nthought) suggests any development of a distinction between voluntary,\ndeliberate, or purposive action and its opposite. To act without\nwei is to remove the social, conceptual character from our\nbehavior and act on \u201cnatural\u201d instinct or intuition. This\nmakes the concept cohere nicely with Laozi\u2019s analysis of names and\nknowledge as forms of social control.\n\nAs we noted, the \u201cinner chapters\u201d of the Zhuangzi\nrarely mentions the slogan. However, its use in the \u201couter\nchapters\u201d invites us to construct a possible Zhuangzi version of\nthe slogan. One tempting view associates wu-wei with the\n\u201cinner chapter\u201d discussions of skillful behavior that\ndevelops into a kind of satisfying and tranquil state of harmony with\naction that we might describe as \u201csecond nature.\u201d In\neffect one acts while in an aesthetic or performative trance. The most\nfamous expression of this ideal comes in the paean to the butcher who\ncarved oxen with the grace of a dancer. Such behavior requires a focus\nand absorption that is incompatible with ordinary self-consciousness,\npurpose and rehearsal of instructions. Besides this loss of a sense of\nthe ego, the experience is credited with creating a unity between the\nactor and the external world, and with a sense of heightened awareness\nand tranquility that comes with the masterful practice of an acquired\nskill. We experience mastery as \u201cbecoming one with the\nactivity.\u201d In some sense, our weiing has become\n[second?] natural!\n\nThe wu-wei ideal also informs the Neo-Daoist slogan\n\u201cSage within; king without.\u201d It suggests (following\nZhuangzi) that Daoist wu-wei may be consistent with being a\ngood Confucian. Being a scholar-official is as much a skill as being a\nbutcher and one may practice it with the same attitude of inner\nemptiness. As long as one takes the \u201cright\u201d attitude, one\nmay pursue any activity consistent\nwith Daoism. Neo-Daoists conform to Confucian roles without regarding\nor interpreting them as ultimately right\u2014or as anything\nelse.\n\nWith the importation of Indo-European Buddhism from India,\nwu-wei started to be interpreted via the Western conceptual\napparatus contrasting desire or purpose and reason. This shaped the\nmodern Chinese interpretation and probably undermined the ideal. It\nbecame the target of attack among \u201cmodern\u201d Chinese who\nregarded Daoist \u201cnon-striving\u201d or\n\u201cpurposelessness\u201d as the source of Chinese passivity. The\nactivist 19th century reformer, Kang You-wei (Kang\nhave-wei) took the denial of the slogan as his scholarly\nname.\n9.5 Pusimplicity (Pre-linguistic Purity) \u6a38\n\nThe Daoist \u201cprimitivist\u201d ideal as expressed mainly in the\nLaozi. It metaphorically represents the result of forgetting\nmingnames and desires (See\n Wu-wei).\n Translations include simplicity, \u201craw\u201d wood, and D. C.\nLau\u2019s more elaborate \u201cuncarved block.\u201d The detailed\ntranslation more sensitively expresses Laozi\u2019s point in using the\nmetaphor in the context of a view of names as \u201ccutting\u201d\nthings into types and Laozi\u2019s distinctive theory that such socially\nconstructed distinctions (institutions) control us by controlling our\ndesires. When societies adopt names or terms, it does so in order to\ninstill and regulate desires for one of the pair created by the\nname-induced distinction. Thus Daoist forgetting requires forgetting\nnames and distinctions, but in doing so, frees itself from the\nsocially induced, unnatural desires that cause strife and unhappiness\nin society (e.g. status, rare objects, fame, authority). Hence:\n\u201cThe Nameless uncarved block thus amounts to freedom from\ndesire.\u201d (Daode Jing 37)\n10. Texts and Textual History\n\nQuestions of textual theory are the focus of the bulk of modern\nscholarship. They include these kinds of questions.\n\nExistence (did Laozi or Zhuangzi actually exist)\nAuthorship (did they write the texts attributed to them?) \nDating (when did they exist or write their texts?)\nRelations (did Laozi influence Zhuangzi?)\n\n\nTraditional \u201cfantastic\u201d textual stories dominated\nexplanations of religious Daoism. This effectively replaces\nphilosophical content with mythical narrative and claims of pedigree\nor status of the founder. This aversion to exposition is compounded\nwith the traditional view that Daoist philosophy defies rational\nclarification. This philosophical site, accordingly, will give only\nabbreviated attention to these textual theories. \n\nThe traditional story centers on Laozi and the Daode Jing. It\ncredits the text to Laozi who was stopped at the pass while attempting\nto leave China (to go to India and come to be known as Buddha). The\nkeeper of the pass required him to leave his dao behind so\nLaozi dashed off 5000-odd quick characters of poetry. Zhuangzi\ninherited the insights and developed the Daoist outlook in parable\nform. \n\nModern text detectives, Chinese and Western, have successfully cast\ndoubt on this traditional view. However, their alternative scenarios,\nwhile collectively more plausible than the traditional story, are\ndiverse enough to lead a skeptic to conclude that no one\nknows the correct textual theories\u2014even if some of them\nturn out to be true. The time is too remote and the evidence too\nscarce to warrant using \u201cknow\u201d of any detailed textual\ntheory.\n\nTextual theorists themselves tend more toward interpretive skepticism.\nThey argue that textual theory is prior to and more certain than\ninterpretation\u2014which they treat as subjective projection. They\nwould reject textual skepticism as defeatism and as self-defeating for\nan interpretive theorist. \n\nCurrent textual thinking tends toward the view that all the classical\nChinese texts were being continuously edited and maintained in textual\ncommunities over sometimes hundreds of years. This editing and\nemendation often reflected interaction with other text communities as\nthey worked out alternative answers to shared questions. Clearly such\nan accretion theory undermines the traditional goal of uncovering the\n\u201coriginal\u201d in the sense of the earliest version of the\ntext. Text selection for interpretive and theoretical purposes becomes\na more normative issue\u2014which text is best? \n\nTextual theory was further complicated when archeologists unearthed\nnew copies of the Daode Jing. The traditionally dominant text\nwas named after one of the earliest commentators\u2014the Wang Bi\nversion. Most translations deviated only slightly from that\ntraditional version prior to the first archeological discovery in\n1973. In that year, two versions of the Daode Jing were\nunearthed in a Mawang Dui tomb site. The discovery energized textual\ntheorists who reasoned that as the earliest physically extant text,\nthe Mawang Dui must be closer to the original should be treated as\nauthoritative. The discovery was quickly followed by a rash of new\ntranslations of the Dedao Jing (the two parts of the text\nwere reversed in the newly discovered manuscripts). \n\nThe argument for its authoritative status was weak. The enthusiasm\nrested on the traditional attachment to an \u201coriginal\u201d text\n(earlier in time). In fact, the discovery tended to confirm the\nevolutionary, multiple-editor view, while this enthusiasm treated\ntextual evolution as if it took place by successive operations on a\nsingle physical text item. Like physiological evolution, text\nevolution more probably operated on a population or\n\u201cstream\u201d of copies, abridgements and additions. \n\nWang Bi probably had access to a range of that population in selecting\nhis version. The archeological discovery was of a single\ninstance\u2014a branch of the stream. The historical circumstances of\nthe presumed time of burial further undermined the optimistic\nassumption that the Mawang Dui was the original. The tomb\u2019s date\nplaces the texts after a radical disruption of textual\nhusbandry\u2014in 200 BCE when the Qin \u201cburned books and buried\nscholars.\u201d \n\nThe Qin had set out to destroy traditional learning. The later Han\nostensibly cherished and tried to recover textual scholarship. In the\nsucceeding Han, text collection, veneration preservation (and copying)\nbecame the norm. The theory that the Mawang Dui was the authoritative\ntext assumes that the destructive political frenzy at the end of\nclassical period had not affected the integrity of transmission that\nproduced the Mawang Dui instances. Then it must insist that in the\nsucceeding period of textual veneration and\npreservation, radical changes were introduced into the entire\npopulation of copies and versions of the text so that all\nthose on which Wang Bi drew on after the Han were corrupted\u2014and\nin similar ways\u2014from the orthodox Mawang Dui version. \n\nThe opposite story is more probable\u2014the sample was a version\nwritten with punctuation and interpretive emendation for a member of\nthe superstitious ruling class. Taking it as representing of the whole\npopulation of texts at the time is an elementary sampling error. \n\nThe Mawang Dui fervor was further undermined in 1993 when another\ndiscovery of a still older pair of abridged texts (dating from before\n200 BCE) turned out to be more like the traditional text (the order of\nselection reflected the traditional daode arrangement). Even\nmore notably, it strongly confirmed the gradual accretion view of the\ntext suggesting that the Daode Jing was still in the process\nof being compiled at that late date. This locates the composition of\nthe Daode Jing and the Zhuangzi almost\nside-by-side.\n\nLaozi\u2019s existence is widely disputed partly because the traditional\nstory seems impossible for one person to satisfy. That only entails,\nhowever, that not all the things in the story are true of him, not\nthat he didn\u2019t exist. On the other hand, there is little positive\nevidence that he did and there are many alternative stories of how he\ncame to be regarded as the author of the Daode Jing. It is\ncommon for theorists to treat \u2018Laozi\u2019 as a definite\ndescription referring to \u201cwhoever wrote the Daode\nJing.\u2014\u201dMany thus regard the question of his existence\nas equivalent to the question of his authorship of at least a part of\nthe text\u2014hence improbable given current textual theory. The\nissues, however, are also separate. Laozi could have existed and not\nwritten any of the text attributed to him. On balance, the existence\nof Zhuangzi is considerably more probable, though little is known of\nhim that is not from the text bearing his name\u2014many of whose\nstories are obviously fanciful. \n\nIn China today, parts of the traditional theory have been resurrected.\nSome scholars are arguing for a pre-Confucius date for Laozi on\nvarious textual grounds (especially poetic structure). Traditional as\nwell as modern scholarship tends to attribute the first eight\n\u201cinner\u201d chapters to Zhuangzi and there has been little\ndoubt about his existence. So far, one important implication of modern\ntextual theory has had little effect on popular interpretations. If we\ninevitably rely on the stories in the Zhuangzi\u2014for\nour knowledge about him, then the known chief intellectual\ninfluence on Zhuangzi should be treated as the sophist and linguistic\ntheorist, Hui Shi, not Laozi or the Daode Jing.\n\nTextual theories of the Zhuangzi are more elaborate and\nconsistent. Though they differ in details and identification of parts,\ntext scholars largely converge on attributing the chapters, outside of\nthe eight assigned to Zhuangzi himself, to students of Zhuangzi, to\nprimitivists who are associated with Yang Zhu (Yangists), and to other\nmore eclectic and religious writers associated probably with the\nproduction of the other texts associated with Daoism. To be strict,\nhowever, despite the prevalence of the opinion, there is nothing\nresembling a convincing argument that Zhuangzi wrote all eight of the\nso called \u201cinner chapters.\u201d \n\nProbably the association of the Laozi and Zhuangzi texts began when\nstudents of Zhuangzi noticed some shared or reinforcing themes\nexpressed in a contemporary anonymous textual group working\non the evolving Daode Jing. Perhaps both groups appreciated\nthe affinity and began to exchange themes, expressions, and related\nlines of thought. Graham argued that the association of Laozi with the\nDaode Jing dates from a conspiratorial attempt to gain\nauthority over Confucianism by claiming that the Daode Jing\nstemmed from Confucius\u2019 teacher who was known in legend as Laozi.\n\nThis is a rough table of the state of textual theories of the two\ndefining texts of Daoism. There are four main questions; the table\nlists, for each question, the traditional story, the range of\ntheories, and the most plausible answer to the question.\n\nExistence\n\n\nTraditional story: Laozi and Zhuangzi like\nteacher-student or prophet-disciple.\nRange of theories: Zhuangzi inspired the\nformulation of the myth of Laozi and the attribution.\nMost plausible answer: Zhuangzi knew only the\nConfucian story of Laozi. Laozi\u2019s actual existence merely\npossible.\n \nAuthorship\n\n\nTraditional story: Laozi wrote the Daode\nJing before traveling to India to found Buddhism. Zhuangzi wrote\nthe Zhuangzi.\nRange of theories: Zhuangzi wrote only chapter\ntwo. Daode Jing a product of Huang-Lao ruler-mysticism.\nMost plausible answer: Both books the product of\ntextual communities who continually edit and add to the text. Zhuangzi\nwrote at most eight chapters.\n \nDating\n\n\nTraditional story: The Daode Jing was\nwritten before Confucius. Zhuangzi inspired to expand on its mystical\ninsight.\nRange of theories: Daode Jing being\nedited well into the Han dynasty. Miscellaneous and Outer chapters of\nthe Zhuangzi edited or composed into the Han.\nMost plausible answer: Both being edited through\nand beyond the classical period.\n \nRelation\n\n\nTraditional story: Laozi prophet/teacher,\nZhuangzi disciple/pupil.\nRange of theories: Zhuangzi formulated his\ntheories first and the chief influence was his sophist friend Hui\nShi.\nMost plausible answer: Textual communities began\nto borrow from each other after the inner chapters completed.\n \n\n\nOther textual theories address the authorship, dating and relations to\nthe two canonical Daoist texts to the later \u201creligious\u201d\ntexts mentioned above. Essentially the upshot is that they borrowed\nheavily from the two classical texts, often changing the context and\nfailing to understand the philosophical point. The quotations they\nused were embedded in popular cosmological and religious contexts.\n",
