Despite its centrality to evolutionary theory, and\nits historical importance, population genetics is not without its\ncritics. Some argue that population geneticists have devoted too much\nenergy to developing theoretical models, often with great mathematical\ningenuity, and too little to actually testing the models against\nempirical data (Wade 2005). This was probably a fair criticism at one\ntime, however the recent flourishing of molecular population genetics\nhas changed the situation, allowing much greater contact between\ntheory and data (Hahn 2018). Others argue that population-genetic\nmodels are usually too idealized to shed any real light on the\nevolutionary process, and are limited in what they can teach us about\nphenotypic evolution (Pigliucci 2008). Still others have argued that,\nhistorically, population genetics has had a relatively minor impact on\nthe actual practice of most evolutionary biologists, despite the\nlip-service often paid to it (Lewontin 1980). However, not all\nbiologists accept these criticisms. Thus the geneticist Michael Lynch\n(2007), for example, has written that \u201cnothing in biology makes\nsense except in the light of population genetics\u201d, in a twist on\nDobzhansky\u2019s famous dictum; see Bromham (2009) and Pigliucci\n(2008) for discussion of Lynch\u2019s arguments. And in a recent\nsurvey of 50 years of population genetics, Charlesworth and\nCharlesworth (2017) argue that population-genetic analysis has not\nonly enabled us to understand the nature and causes of molecular\ngenetic variation, but has also provided deep insights into a variety\nof topics in evolutionary biology.\n\nPopulation-genetic models of evolution have sometimes been criticised\non the grounds that few phenotypic traits are controlled by genotype\nat a single locus, or even two or three loci. (Multi-locus\npopulation-genetic models do exist, but they are inevitably very\ncomplicated.) There is an alternative body of theory, known as\nquantitative genetics, which deals with so-called\n\u2018polygenic\u2019 or \u2018continuous\u2019 traits, such as\nheight, which are thought to be affected by genes at many different\nloci in the genome, rather than just one or two; see Falconer (1995)\nor Walsh and Lynch (2018) for good overviews. Quantitative genetics\nemploys a quite different methodology from population genetics. The\nlatter, as we have seen, aims to track gene and genotype frequencies\nacross generations. By contrast, quantitative genetics does not\ndirectly deal with gene frequencies; the aim is to track the phenotype\ndistribution, or moments of the distribution such as the mean or the\nvariance, across generations. Though widely used by animal and plant\nbreeders, quantitative genetics is usually regarded as a less\nfundamental body of theory than population genetics, given its\n\u2018phenotypic\u2019 orientation. Nonetheless, the relationship\nbetween population and quantitative genetics is essentially\nharmonious.\n\nA different criticism of the population-genetic approach to evolution\nis that it ignores embryological development; this criticism really\napplies to the evolutionary theory of the \u2018modern\nsynthesis\u2019 era more generally, which had population genetics at\nits core. As we have seen, population-genetic reasoning assumes that\nan organism\u2019s genes somehow affect its phenotype, and thus its\nfitness, but it is silent about the details of how genes actually\nbuild organisms, i.e., about embryology. The founders of the modern\nsynthesis treated embryology as a \u2018black box\u2019, the details\nof which could be ignored for the purposes of evolutionary theory;\ntheir focus was on the transmission of genes across generations, not\nthe process by which genes make organisms (see the entry on\n evolution and development).\n This strategy was perfectly reasonable, given how little was\nunderstood about development at the time. But since the 1990s, great\nstrides have been made in molecular developmental genetics, which has\nrenewed hopes of integrating the study of embryological development\nwith evolutionary theory and has led to the emergence of the\ndiscipline of \u2018evolutionary developmental biology\u2019, or\nevo-devo (see Arthur 2021 for a recent overview or the entry on\n evolution and development). \nIt is sometimes argued that evo-devo is in tension with traditional\nneo-Darwinism (e.g., Amundson 2007), but it is more plausible to view\nthem as complementary ways of studying evolution that have different\nemphases.\n\nIn a 2005 book, Sean Carroll, a leading evo-devo researcher, argued\nthat population genetics no longer deserves pride-of-place on the\nevolutionary biology curriculum. He writes: \u201cmillions of biology\nstudents have been taught the view (from population genetics) that\n\u2018evolution is change in gene frequencies\u2019 \u2026 This\nview forces the explanation toward mathematics and abstract\ndescriptions of genes, and away from butterflies and zebras, or\nAustralopithecines and Neanderthals\u201d (2005 p. 294). A similar\nargument has been made by Pigliucci (2008). Carroll argues that\ninstead of defining evolution as \u2018change in gene\nfrequencies\u2019, we should define it as \u2018change in\ndevelopment\u2019, in recognition of the fact that most morphological\nevolution is brought about through mutations that affect organismic\ndevelopment. Carroll may be right that evo-devo makes for a more\naccessible introduction to evolutionary biology than population\ngenetics, and that an exclusive focus on gene frequency dynamics is\nnot the best way to understand all evolutionary phenomena; but\npopulation genetics arguably remains indispensable to a full\nunderstanding of the evolutionary process.\n\nIn recent years, a vigourous debate has opened up about whether the\n\u201cmodern synthesis\u201d (MS) is still adequate to the needs of\nbiology. The MS, or neo-Darwinian synthesis, is the intellectual\nedifice that arose in the 20th century from the integration of\nDarwin\u2019s theory of evolution with Mendelian genetics, which had\npopulation genetics at its core, as we have seen. Proponents of the\n\u201cextended evolutionary synthesis\u201d, or EES, argue that the\nmain principle of the MS\u2014that adaptive evolution arises from\nnatural selection acting on sporadic genetic mutation\u2014is not\nwrong but is not the whole story either, and needs supplementation in\nthe light of recent discoveries (Pigliucci and Muller eds. 2010;\nLaland et al. 2014, 2015). They point to phenomena such as niche\nconstruction, epigenetic inheritance, multi-level selection,\nphenotypic plasticity and developmental bias, which, they claim, do\nnot fit easily with the MS\u2019s emphasis on gene-based evolution.\nThe EES\u2019s proponents are typically somewhat suspicious of\npopulation genetics, and seek to downplay its explanatory\nsignificance. However, their views are controversial. Defenders of the\ntraditional MS argue that the empirical phenomena in question are of\nrelatively minor evolutionary importance and / or that they can be\naccommodated within the MS without any major paradigm shift (Wray et\nal. 2014; Walsh and Lynch 2018; Charlesworth, Barton and Charlesworth\n2017). This debate looks set to continue.\n\nDespite the criticisms levelled against it, population genetics has\ncertainly had a major influence on our understanding of evolution. For\nexample, the well-known \u2018gene\u2019s eye\u2019 view of\nevolution, developed by G.C. Williams (1966), W. D. Hamilton (1964)\nand R. Dawkins (1976), stems directly from population-genetic\nreasoning; indeed, important aspects of gene\u2019s eye thinking were\nalready present in Fisher\u2019s writings (Okasha 2008, Ewens 2011).\nProponents of the gene\u2019s eye view argue that genes are the real\nbeneficiaries of the evolutionary process; genotypes and organisms are\nmere temporary manifestations. Natural selection is at root a matter\nof competition between gene lineages for greater representation in the\ngene pool; creating organisms with adaptive features is a\n\u2018strategy\u2019 that genes have devised to secure their\nposterity (Dawkins 1976, 1982). Gene\u2019s eye thinking has\nrevolutionised many areas of evolutionary biology in the last fifty\nyears, particularly in the field of animal behaviour (cf. Agren 2021),\nbut in many ways it is simply a colourful gloss on the conception of\nevolution implicit in the formalisms of population genetics.\n6. Philosophical and Conceptual Issues in Population Genetics\n\nPopulation genetics raises a number of interesting conceptual and\nphilosophical issues. One such issue concerns the concept of the gene\nitself. As we have seen, population genetics came into being in the\n1920s and 1930s, long before the molecular structure of genes had been\ndiscovered. In these pre-molecular days, the gene was a theoretical\nentity, postulated in order to explain observed patterns of\ninheritance in breeding experiments; what genes were made of, how they\ncaused phenotypic changes, and how they were transmitted from parent\nto offspring were not known. Today we do know the answers to these\nquestions, thanks to the spectacular success of molecular genetics and\ngenomics. The gene has gone from being a theoretical entity to being\nsomething that can actually be manipulated in the laboratory.\n\nThe relationship between the gene of classical (pre-molecular)\ngenetics, and the gene of modern molecular genetics is a subtle and\nmuch discussed topic (Beurton, Falk and Rheinberger (eds.) 2000,\nGriffiths and Stotz 2006, Moss 2003, Meunier 2022). In molecular\ngenetics, \u2018gene\u2019 refers, more or less, to a stretch of DNA\nthat codes for a particular protein\u2014so a gene is a unit of\nfunction. But in classical population genetics, \u2018gene\u2019\nrefers, more or less, to a portion of hereditary material that is\ninherited intact across generations\u2014so a gene is a unit of\ntransmission, not a unit of function. In many cases, the two concepts\nof gene will pick out roughly the same entities\u2014which has led\nsome philosophers to argue that classical genetics can be\n\u2018reduced\u2019 to molecular genetics (Sarkar 1998). But it is\nclear that the two concepts do not have precisely the same extension;\nnot every molecular gene is a classical gene, nor vice-versa. Some\ntheorists go further than this, arguing that what molecular biology\nreally shows is that there are no such things as classical genes.\n\nWhatever one\u2019s view of this debate, it is striking that\nvirtually all of the central concepts of population genetics were\ndevised in the pre-molecular era, when so little was known about what\ngenes were; the basic structure of population-genetic theory has\nchanged little since the days of Fisher, Haldane and Wright\n(Charlesworth and Charlesworth 2017). This reflects the fact that the\nempirical presuppositions of population-genetic models are really\nquite slim; the basic presupposition is simply the existence of\nhereditary particles that obey the Mendelian rules of transmission,\nand that somehow affect the phenotype. Therefore, even without\nknowing what these hereditary particles are made of, or how they exert\ntheir phenotypic effects, the early population geneticists were able\nto devise an impressive body of theory. That the theory continues to\nbe useful today illustrates the power of abstract models in\nscience.\n\nThis leads us to another facet of population genetics that has\nattracted philosophers\u2019 attention: the way in which abstract\nmodels, that involve simplifying assumptions known to be false, can\nilluminate actual empirical phenomena. Idealized models of this sort\nplay a central role in many sciences, including physics, economics and\nbiology, and raise interesting methodological issues. In particular,\nthere is often a trade-off between realism and tractability; the more\nrealistic a model the more complicated it becomes, which typically\nlimits its usefulness and its range of applicability. This general\nproblem and others like it have been extensively discussed in the\nphilosophical literature on modelling (e.g., Godfrey-Smith 2006,\nWeisberg 2006, Frigg and Hartmann 2006), and are related to population\ngenetics by Plutynski (2006).\n\nIt is clear that population genetics models rely on assumptions known\nto be false, and are subject to the realism / tractability trade-off.\nThe simplest population-genetic models assume random mating,\nnon-overlapping generations, infinite population size, perfect\nMendelian segregation, frequency-independent genotype fitnesses, and\nthe absence of stochastic effects; it is very unlikely (and in the\ncase of the infinite population assumption, impossible) that any of\nthese assumptions hold true of any actual biological population. More\nrealistic models, that relax one of more of the above assumptions,\nhave been constructed, but they are invariably much harder to analyze.\nIt is an interesting historical question whether these\n\u2018standard\u2019 population-genetic assumptions were originally\nmade because they simplified the mathematics, or because they were\nbelieved to be a reasonable approximation to reality, or both. This\nquestion is taken up by Morrison (2004, 2014) in relation to\nFisher\u2019s early population-genetic work.\n\nAnother philosophical issue raised by population genetics is\nreductionism. It is often argued that the population-genetic view of\nevolution is inherently reductionistic, by both its critics and its\ndefenders. This is apparent from how population geneticists define\nevolution: change in gene frequency. Implicit in this definition is\nthe idea that evolutionary phenomena such as speciation, adaptive\nradiation and diversification, as well as phenotypic evolution, can\nultimately be reduced to gene frequency change. But do we really know\nthis to be true? Many biologists, particularly \u2018whole\norganism\u2019 biologists, are not convinced, and thus reject both\nthe population-genetic definition of evolution and the primacy\ntraditionally accorded to population genetics within evolutionary\nbiology (Pigliucci 2008).\n\nThis is a large question, and is related to the issues discussed in\nsection 5 above. The question can be usefully divided into two: (i)\ncan microevolutionary processes explain all of evolution?; (ii) can\nall of microevolution be reduced to population genetics?\n\u2018Microevolution\u2019 refers to evolutionary changes that take\nplace within a given population, over relatively short periods of time\n(e.g., a few hundred generations). These changes typically involve the\nsubstitution of a gene for its alleles, of exactly the sort modelled\nby population genetics. So over microevolutionary time-scales, we do\nnot typically expect to see extinction, speciation or major\nmorphological change \u2014 phenomena which are called\n\u2018macroevolutionary\u2019. Many biologists believe that\nmacroevolution is simply \u2018microevolution writ large\u2019, but\nthis view is not universal. Authors such as Gould (2002) and Eldredge\n(1989), for example, have argued persuasively that macroevolutionary\nphenomena are governed by autonomous dynamics, irreducible to a\nmicroevolutionary basis. Philosophical discussions of this issue\ninclude Sterelny (1996), Grantham (1995) and Okasha (2006). A useful\noverview is provided by Turner and Havstad (2019).\n\nSetting aside the reducibility of macro to microevolution, there is\nstill the issue of whether an exclusively population-genetic approach\nto the latter is satisfactory. Some reasons for doubting this have\nbeen discussed already; they include the complexity of the\ngenotype-phenotype relation, the fact that population genetics treats\ndevelopment as a black-box, and the idealizing assumptions that its\nmodels rest on. Another point, not discussed above, is the fact that\npopulation genetics models are (deliberately) silent about the\ncauses of the fitness differences between genotypes whose\nconsequences they model (Sober 1984, Glymour 2006). For example, in\nthe simple one-locus model of section 3.1, nothing is said about why\nthe three genotypes leave different numbers of successful gametes. To\nfully understand evolution, the ecological factors that lead to these\nfitness differences must also be understood. While this is a valid\npoint, the most it shows is that an exclusively population-genetic\napproach cannot yield a complete understanding of the evolutionary\nprocess. This does not really threaten the traditional view that\npopulation genetics is fundamental to evolutionary theory.\n\nA final suite of philosophical issues surrounding population genetics\nconcerns causation. Evolutionary biology is standardly thought of as a\nscience that yields causal explanations: it tells us the causes of\nparticular evolutionary phenomena (Okasha 2009, Otsuka 2016a). This\ncausal dimension to evolutionary explanations is echoed in population\ngenetics, where selection, mutation, migration and random drift are\noften described as causes, or \u2018forces\u2019, that lead to gene\nfrequency change (Sober 1984). The basis for this way of speaking is\nobvious enough. If the frequency of allele \\(A\\) in a population\nincreases from one generation to another, and if the population obeys\nthe rules of Mendelian inheritance, then as a matter of logic one of\nthree things must have happened: (I) migrants bearing allele\n\\(A\\) entered the population (II); there was mutation to allele\n\\(A\\) from another allele; (III) the average number of\ndescendants left by each copy of \\(A\\) in the parental generation\nexceeded the average for all genes. It is straightforward to verify\nthat if none of (I)\u2013(III) occurred, then the frequency of allele\n\\(A\\) would have been unchanged. Note that case (III) covers both\nselection and random drift, depending on whether copies of \\(A\\)\nleft more descendants than average by chance, or because of some\nsystematic effect of \\(A\\) on organismic fitness.\n\nDespite this point, a number of philosophers have objected to the idea\nthat evolutionary change can usefully be thought of as caused by\ndifferent factors, including natural selection (e.g., Matthen and\nAriew 2009, Walsh 2007). A variety of objections to this apparently\ninnocent way of speaking have been levelled; some of these seem to be\nobjections to the metaphor of \u2018forces\u2019 in particular,\nwhile others turn on more general considerations to do with causality\nand chance. The status of these objections is a controversial matter;\nsee Reisman and Forber (2005), Brandon and Ramsey (2007), Sarkar\n(2011) and in particular Otsuka (2016b) for critical discussion. The\n\u2018non-causal\u2019 (or \u2018statisticalist\u2019 as it is\nsometimes called) view of evolution is certainly a radical one, since\nthe idea that natural selection, in particular, is a potential cause\nof evolutionary change is virtually axiomatic in evolutionary biology,\nand routinely taught to students of the subject. As Millstein (2002)\npoints out, if one abandons this view it becomes hard to make sense of\nimportant episodes in the history of evolutionary biology, such as the\nselectionist / neutralist controversy mentioned above.\n\nA full resolution of this issue cannot be attempted here; however, it\nis worth making one observation about the idea that mutation,\nselection, migration and drift should be regarded as\n\u2018causes\u2019 of gene frequency change. There is an important\ndifference between drift on the one hand and the other three factors\non the other. This is because mutation, selection and migration are\ndirectional; they typically lead to a non-zero expected change in gene\nfrequencies (Rice 2004 p. 132). Random drift on the other hand is\nnon-directional; the expected change due to drift is by definition\nzero. As Rice (2004) points out, this means that mutation, selection\nand migration can each be represented by a vector field on the space\nof gene frequencies; their combined effects on the overall\nevolutionary change is then represented by ordinary vector addition\n(which arguably lends substance of the \u201cforce\u201d metaphor).\nBut drift cannot be treated this way, for it has a magnitude but not a\ndirection. In so far as proponents of the \u2018non-causal\u2019\nview are motivated by the oddity of regarding drift, or chance, as a\nforce, they have a point. However this line of argument is specific to\nrandom drift; it does not generalize to all the factors that affect\ngene frequency change. And it does not alter the fact that, in\nattributing the spread of a gene to random drift, we have given a\nbona fide scientific explanation that is potentially falsifiable; for\nwe have said that the gene\u2019s spread was not due to any\nsystematic advantage that the gene conferred on organisms that had it.\n\n\nA final area of philosophical concern to which population genetics is\nrelevant is the debate over the status of racial categories. This is a\ncentral topic within the philosophy of race, a burgeoning sub-field of\nphilosophy (see the entry on\n race\n for an overview). One influential line of argument has it that racial\ncategories are social constructions rather than natural kinds. On this\nview, the division of the human species into distinct\n\u201craces\u201d (which can be done in multiple ways), should be\nunderstood primarily in terms of the social and political role that such\nracial categories play. This view is sometimes called\n\u201canti-realism\u201d about race, since it holds that the usual\nways of dividing humans into races (as employed in national censuses,\nfor example) are conventional rather than real. Opponents of\nanti-realism have sometimes drawn on human population genetics to\nbolster the rival position that racial divisions are in fact real\n(Andreasen 2007, Sesardic 2010, Spencer 2015). Empirical studies of\nhow genetic variation in humans is structured, using machine learning\ntechniques, have found genetic clusters that appear to roughly\ncorrespond to certain broad racial groupings (such as\n\u201cAfrican\u201d and \u201cEurasian\u201d) (Rosenberg et al.\n2002, Li et al. 2008). However, the precise bearing of these empirical\nresults on the question of the reality versus conventionality of\nracial divisions is a matter of ongoing philosophical dispute (Kopec\n2014, Winther 2014).\n\nTo conclude, there are a number of interesting philosophical issues\nsurrounding population genetics discussed in the recent literature. In\naddition to these, population genetics is indirectly relevant to a\nstill broader set of philosophical concerns, given its centrality to\nevolutionary biology, a science replete with implications for many\nbranches of philosophy.",
