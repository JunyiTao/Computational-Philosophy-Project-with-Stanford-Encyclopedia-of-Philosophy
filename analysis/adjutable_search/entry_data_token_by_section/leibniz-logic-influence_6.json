    "main_text": "The Discovery of Leibniz in Mathematical Logic\n5. The Discovery of Leibniz in Mathematical Logic\n\n\nThe discovery of Leibniz in mathematical logic can be shown by\nexample in the case of George Boole, the founder of the algebra of\nlogic (cf. Peckhaus 1997, 185\u2013232; on Ernst Schr\u00f6der\u2019s\ndiscovery of Leibniz cf. ibid., 233\u2013287). In his first writing on\nlogic, the booklet The Mathematical Analysis of Logic of 1847,\nhe gave an algebraic interpretation of traditional logic. His fame as\none of the founders of modern logic goes back to his An\nInvestigation of the Laws of Thought of 1854. According to\nBoole\u2019s own evaluation, his main innovation was the Index Law\n(1847), later revised to the Law of Duality, also called\n\u201cBoole\u2019s Law\u201d. This law expresses idempotence:\n\nA = AA\n\n\nWhat are the connections to Leibniz\u2019s logic? Are there\nanticipations of the Boolean calculus in the work of Leibniz? One of\nthose authors looking for anticipations was Robert Leslie Ellis\n(1817\u20131859), who edited Francis Bacon\u2019s Novum\nOrganon in The Works of Francis Bacon (1858\u20131874;\nvol. 1: 1858). During his editorial works he found a parallel to\nBoole\u2019s Law (p. 281, footnote 1): \u201cMr. Boole\u2019s\nLaws of Thought contain the first development of ideas of\nwhich the germ is to be found in Bacon and Leibnitz; to the latter of\nwhom the fundamental principle in logic a2 =\na was known.\u201d As reference he gave Erdmann\u2019s\nedition (Erdmann 1840, p. 130). Robert Harley (1828\u20131910),\nBoole\u2019s first biographer, discussed this information in a paper\nentitled \u201cRemarks on Boole\u2019s Mathematical Analysis of\nLogic\u201d (1867). He did not find the proper quote at the place\nindicated by Ellis, but he found other relevant texts. About the\nsignificance of Ellis\u2019 remark he wrote: \u201cBoole did not\nbecome aware of these anticipations by Leibnitz until more than twelve\nmonths after the publication of the \u2018Laws of Thought,\u2019 when\nthey were pointed out to him by R. Leslie Ellis\u201d (p. 5).\n\n\nHarley\u2019s research was taken up by the Manchester economist and\nphilosopher William Stanley Jevons (1825\u20131882). Jevons formulated\nhis philosophy of science, as found in the Principles of\nScience (1874), against John Stuart Mill\u2019s\npredominant inductive logic. His alternative to inductive logic was the\n\u201cPrinciple of Substitution\u201d. He included a section\n\u201cAnticipations of the Principle of Substitution\u201d, which was\nenlarged in the later edition with a long discussion of Leibniz\u2019s\nanticipations. There he expressed his thanks to Robert Adamson for the\ninformation that the Principle of Substitution can be traced back to\nLeibniz. Jevons asked what were the reasons for the long ignorance of\nLeibniz\u2019s anticipations. Only Dutens\u2019 edition was available\nin Owens College Library, Manchester. He regretted having overlooked\nErdmann\u2019s edition, but noted that this was also done by other\n\u201cmost learned logicians\u201d.\n\n\nFinally, John Venn (1834\u20131923) has to be mentioned. His\nSymbolic Logic (1881) is important for the historical\ncontextualization of the new logic. He criticized Jevons\u2019\nstatement on the Law of Duality according to which \u201cthe late\nProfessor Boole is the only logician in modern times who has drawn\nattention to this remarkable property of logical terms\u201d as being\nsimply false. Besides, Leibniz, Lambert, Ploucquet and Segner had\nanticipated the law \u201cperfectly explicitly\u201d and he had no\ndoubts \u201cthat any one better acquainted than myself with the\nLeibnitzian and Wolfian logicians could add many more such\nnotices\u201d (Venn 1881, xxxi, footnote 1).\n",
