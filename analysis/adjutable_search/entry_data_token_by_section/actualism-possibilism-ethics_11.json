    "main_text": "Actualism || A Contextualist Formulation of Actualism\n3.3 A Contextualist Formulation of Actualism\n\nIn contrast to the views of Goldman and Sobel, other forms of\nactualism embrace the possibility of jointly unfulfillable obligations\nwhile simultaneously resisting the claim that actualism implies the\npossibility of obligation dilemmas, i.e., scenarios in which all of\nthe options available to an agent over time result in a failure to\nfulfill at least one obligation. Consider Frank Jackson and Robert\nPargetter\u2019s (1986: 233) formulation of actualism.\n\n\n[T]he values that should figure in determining which option is best\nand so ought to be done out of a set of options are the values of what\nwould be the case were the agent to adopt or carry out the\noption, where what would be the case includes of course what the agent\nwould simultaneously or subsequently in fact do: the (relevant) value\nof an option is the value of what would in fact be the case were the\nagent to perform it.\n\n\nJackson and Pargetter (1986: 244\u2013245) maintain that there are\ndifferent sets of options out of which different obligations arise.\nFor instance, from the set of all \\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_3\\) act-sets\navailable to Jones at \\(t_1\\), the option with the highest value\nconsists of the act-set that includes \u27e8Jones\u2019s voting for\nthe language requirement\u27e9 at \\(t_3\\). Therefore, out of the\n\\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_3\\) act-set, at \\(t_1\\) Jones is obligated to\n\u27e8go to the office, then go to the faculty meeting, and then\nvote for the language requirement\u27e9. This is because what would\nhappen if this act-set were to occur is better than what would happen\nif some other \\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_3\\) act-set were to occur. But on the\nother hand, from the set of immediately performable acts available to\nJones at \\(t_1\\), the option with the highest value consists of\nJones\u2019 \u27e8staying home\u27e9 because what would happen if\nJones were to \u27e8stay home\u27e9 is better than what would\nhappen if Jones were to \u27e8go to the office\u27e9. Therefore,\nout of the performable \\(t_1\\) acts, at \\(t_1\\) Jones is obligated to\n\u27e8stay home\u27e9. Like\n (G),\n Jackson and Pargetter\u2019s view does not assess an act\u2019s\ndeontic status in the procedural manner with which Goldman\u2019s\n (G*1)\n or Sobel\u2019s\n (S)\n assesses an act\u2019s deontic status. Moreover, like (G), Jackson\nand Pargetter\u2019s view implies the possibility of obligations that\ncannot be jointly fulfilled. We will henceforth refer to their view as\ncontextualist actualism because what an agent is obligated to do\ndepends on the set of options being considered within a certain\ncontext.\n",
