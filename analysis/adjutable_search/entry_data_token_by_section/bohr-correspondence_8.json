Interpretations in the Current Physics Literature\n\nOne typically finds a very different understanding of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle in the current physics literature. Even as\nearly as Max Born\u2019s classic text on the new quantum\n theory,[12]\n first published in 1933, one finds the correspondence principle\ndefined as follows:\n\nThe leading idea (Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle,\n1923) may be stated broadly as follows. Judged by the test of\nexperience, the laws of classical physics have brilliantly justified\nthemselves in all processes of motion\u2026 It must therefore be\nlaid down as an unconditionally necessary postulate, that the new\nmechanics \u2026 must in all these problems reach the same results\nas the classical mechanics. In other words, it must be demanded that,\nfor the limiting cases of large masses and of orbits of large\ndimensions, the new mechanics passes over into classical mechanics.\n(Born [1933] 1957, p. 103).\n\n\nThere are two strands to Born\u2019s rereading of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle that have become quite common in the physics\nliterature: first, the correspondence principle as a very general\nrequirement that quantum mechanics ought to be able to recover the\nempirical successes of classical mechanics; and, second, the more\nspecific requirement that it recover the predictions of classical\nmechanics in the limit of large masses and orbits of large\ndimension\u2014this latter limit is typically expressed as \\(n\n\\rightarrow \\infty\\).\n\nIn David Bohm\u2019s classic textbook on standard quantum mechanics,\nthe correspondence principle is similarly interpreted as a general\nrelation between the two theories: \u201c[T]he correspondence\nprinciple, which was first given by Bohr \u2026 states that the laws\nof quantum physics must be so chosen that in the classical limit,\nwhere many quanta are involved, the quantum laws lead to the classical\nequations as an average\u201d (Bohm 1951, p. 31).\n\nIn his 1984 Physics Today article \u201cThe Correspondence\nPrinciple Revisited,\u201d Richard Liboff argues that Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle is not a general claim about recovering\nclassical mechanics from quantum mechanics, but the following more\nrestricted claim: \u201cthe quantum frequency spectrum of a periodic\nsystem approaches the classical spectrum in the limit of large\n\\(n\\)\u201d (Liboff 1984, p. 52). Liboff goes on to note that even\nthis restricted form of the correspondence principle is violated for\nsystems such as a particle in a box and a rigid rotor. He notes that\n\u201c[i]n both of these cases, the limit \\(h \\rightarrow 0\\) leads\nto frequency correspondence, but the limit \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\)\ndoes not\u201d (Liboff 1984, p. 52).\n\nFollowing on Liboff, Ghazi Hassoun and Donald Kobe (1989) have argued\nthat in order to obtain a meaningful classical limit of quantum\nmechanical eigenvalues it is necessary that \u201cboth formulations\n[of the correspondence principle] are used concurrently in the sense\nthat the Planck constant goes to zero and the appropriate quantum\nnumber goes to infinity \u2026 subject to the constraint that \\(nh =\nJ\\), where \\(J\\) is the appropriate classical action\u201d (Hassoun\nand Kobe 1989, p. 658). On this reading, Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple is construed simply as the limit \\(n \\rightarrow\n\\infty\\). Although they call this limit \u201cBohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle\u201d, they note that Bohr was able to\nobtain the correct classical orbital frequency precisely\n\u201cbecause he did not take the mathematical limit as the quantum\nnumber goes to infinity. Instead, Bohr considered that for large\nquantum numbers the quantum result was very nearly the classical\nresult. Thus the quantum number \\(n\\), say, was \\(n \\gg 1\\), but was\nnot infinite\u201d (Hassoun and Kobe 1989, p.  661). They conclude\nthat the correspondence principle is \u201coften thought to be\nimprecise because of Bohr\u2019s use of large, but not infinite,\nquantum numbers. However, when the Bohr and Planck formulations are\nsynthesized, as shown in this article, the correspondence principle\nhas a precise mathematical form\u201d (Hassoun and Kobe 1989,\np. 661). The correspondence principle on this reading is understood\nbroadly as the attempt to get a mathematically precise formulation of\nthe classical limit.\n\nMuch of the contemporary physics community\u2019s interest in\nBohr\u2019s correspondence principle (variously understood) is in\nprima facie violations of this principle by particular classes of\nphysical systems. For example, Joseph Ford and Giorgio Mantica, in\ntheir article, \u201cDoes Quantum Mechanics Obey the Correspondence\nPrinciple? Is It Complete?\u201d define the correspondence principle\nas requiring that \u201cany two valid physical theories which have an\noverlap in their domains of validity must, to relevant accuracy, yield\nthe same predictions for physical observations\u201d (Ford and\nMantica 1992, p. 1087). Their concern is whether quantum mechanics can\naccount for the behavior of chaotic classical systems. Similarly,\nWojciech Zurek defines the correspondence principle as a demand for an\nagreement between the \u201cquantum and classical expectation\nvalues\u201d (Habib et al. 1998), arguing that without the phenomenon\nof decoherence, the correspondence principle is violated.\n\nWhile the contemporary physics literature\u2019s understanding of the\ncorrespondence principle is largely in line with Max Born\u2019s\nconstrual of this principle (given above), it was not what Bohr\nhimself meant by the correspondence principle. Although Bohr agreed\nthat quantum mechanics ought to be able to recover the empirically\nconfirmed predictions of classical mechanics, he explicitly rejected\nthis reading of the correspondence principle. Indeed L\u00e9on\nRosenfeld recounts Bohr\u2019s frustration at the continued\nmisunderstanding of his principle. When Rosenfeld off-handedly\nsuggested to Bohr that the correspondence principle was about the\nasymptotic agreement of quantum and classical predictions, Bohr\nemphatically protested and replied, \u201cIt is not the\ncorrespondence argument. The requirement that the quantum theory\nshould go over to the classical description for low modes of\nfrequency, is not at all a principle. It is an obvious requirement for\nthe theory\u201d (Rosenfeld 1973, p. 690).\n",
