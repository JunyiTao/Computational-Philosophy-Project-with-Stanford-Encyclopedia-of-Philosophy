    "main_text": "Language and Thought\n6. Language and Thought\n\nIn Hartley\u2019s account, at birth we enter the world already\nhumming with \u201coriginally automatic\u201d motions. Thanks to the\nactivity of our brain and nerves, these motions are self-regulating\nand homeostatic, responsive to bodily feedback and external stimuli.\nThen, as we grow, we gain voluntary control over some of our\nmovements, perfect those that become secondarily automatic, and learn\nto carry out decomplex actions that draw on repertoires of secondarily\nautomatic components.\n\nIn Hartley\u2019s account of human nature, the concept of the\n\u201cassociation of ideas\u201d plays a central role. But the\nparadigmatic instances of \u201cassociation\u201d are, first, the\n\u201cjoint impressions\u201d that generate \u201cideas\u201d\n(including complex movements), and second, the flowing cascades of\nmovement that are decomplex actions. Such decomplex actions are\ncentral to the lives we lead. And foremost among decomplex actions are\nthe sentences we speak.\n\nFor Hartley, language is a highly \u201cdecomplex\u201d motor\nactivity that involves the cementing of associations between perceived\nand created sounds, and, for the literate, perceived and created\nmarks: \u201cimpressions made on the ear,\u201d \u201cactions of\nthe organs of speech,\u201d \u201cimpressions made upon the\neye,\u201d and \u201cactions of the hand in writing\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 79). Further connections must be made between\nperceived or created sounds and features of the world, especially the\nactions of oneself and of other people. Hartley\u2019s approach is\nnearly the opposite of Locke\u2019s, who writes as if language were a\ndictionary, in which each word marks an idea known prelinguistically\nto the speaker: \u201cwords being voluntary signs, they cannot be\nvoluntary signs imposed by [the speaker] on things he knows\nnot\u2026 . Till he has some ideas of his own, he cannot suppose\nthem to correspond with the conceptions of another man; nor can he use\nany signs for them\u201d (Locke [1690] 1975, 3.2.2).\n\nThus while Locke seems to be saying that individuals first have ideas,\nand then turn to language to communicate them to others, Hartley\ndescribes a process whereby, as children, we burble and cry and\nlisten\u2014and gradually gain motor control of our burbling and\ncrying, associate it with what we hear and handle and do, and\neventually learn the meaning of what we say. Once again, the process\nof association\u2014here the activity of hearing and speaking, and\nlater reading and writing\u2014generates ideas: we have ideas because\nwe use language, in concrete social interactions; we do not create\nlanguage to express the ideas we, as lone individuals, already\nhave.\n\nIn this regard, consider Hume\u2019s assertion that, if we are unsure\nabout the meaning of a word, \u201cwe need but enquire, from what\nimpression is that supposed idea derived?\u201d (Hume [1748]\n1975, 22), and his recommendation that we abandon words that lack such\nderivations. From Hartley\u2019s point of view, this is manifestly\nbad advice.\n\nFor Hartley, complex and decomplex ideas are wholes that do not\n\u201cbear any relation to [their] compounding parts.\u201d\nSpecifically, \u201cthe decomplex idea belonging to any sentence is\nnot compounded merely of the complex ideas belonging to the words in\nit\u201d (OM 1, prop. 12). The meaning of an utterance is a\nproperty of the whole\u2014of the performance of a specific decomplex\naction in a social and pragmatic context. Moreover, \u201cboth\nchildren and adults learn the ideas belonging to whole sentences many\ntimes in a summary way, and not by adding together the ideas of the\nseveral words in the sentence.\u201d Consequently, children and\nilliterate adults find it hard to \u201cseparate sentences into the\nseveral words which compound them\u201d (OM 1, prop.\n80).\n\nThus the meanings of sentences are not simply derivable from the\nmeanings of the words in them, and the meanings of those words are not\nderivable from the \u201cimpressions\u201d to which they refer. When\nchildren begin to speak, they utter \u201csentences\u201d that,\nthough short (Mommy!) are whole, complete, and meaningful\nexpressions. It is only when they learn to read that they realize\nsentences are composed of individual words. Over time, the sentences\nincrease in decomplexity, as people participate in the activities of\nlife. As adults, people speak a vast variety of highly decomplex\nexpressions\u2014including, for example, those involved in the\npractice of a science, or a religion.\n",
