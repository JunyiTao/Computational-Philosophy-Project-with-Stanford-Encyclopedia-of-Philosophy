    "main_text": "Overview\n2. Overview\n\nThe Laws comprises a conversation in 12 books, set on Crete,\namong three interlocutors: an unnamed Athenian Visitor (Plato\u2019s\nspokesman in the Laws), Megillus, a Spartan, and Kleinias, a\nCretan. The Athenian proposes that the three discuss governance and\nlaws as they walk along the long road to the temple of Zeus. The first\ntwo books of the dialogue consider the proper goal or end\n(telos) of legislation, which turns out to be the virtue of\nthe citizens. They also contain discussion of topics, such as ethical\npsychology and education, which will help them to understand how a\ncity could achieve this goal. The third book turns to a discussion of\nthe origins of political systems (politeia) and of changes in\nthose political systems, and attempts to draw lessons for the lawmaker\nfrom the histories of various actual states, including Persia, Sparta,\nCrete, and Athens. At the end of Book 3 (Laws\n702B4\u2013D5), Kleinias reveals that he has a practical use for just\nthe kinds of discussions they\u2019ve been having: the cities of\nCrete have decided to found a new city, to be named Magnesia, in a\nlong abandoned part of Crete, and he, along with nine others, is to be\nresponsible for doing so. He asks the Athenian to help in the\nconstruction of the new city\u2019s constitution and laws. The\nAthenian agrees, and proposes that they use a new method of law-giving\n\u2013 one in which preludes which aim at persuading the citizens\ncome before the laws themselves. Books 4\u20135 contain an argument\nfor the use of preludes and the Great Prelude to the laws in general.\nThe Great Prelude to the laws in general ends in the latter part of\nBook 5, after which the Athenian proceeds to sketch, often in\nconsiderable detail, the constitution, the political and social\ninstitutions, and the laws of this new city, along with the political\nand ethical principles that justify them.\n\nA brief sketch of the content and structure of the first 5 books of\nthe Laws follows. From that point on (after the end of the\nGreat Prelude), we will organize our discussion topically rather than\ngoing book by book.\nBook 1\n\nThe dialogue begins with an investigation into the reasons for the\nlaws and social practices of Sparta and Crete. The Athenian argues\nthat laws ought to be justified not by reference to war \u2013 which\nis how both Megillus and Kleinias first attempt to justify the laws of\ntheir own cities \u2013 but rather by reference to what is best,\nwhich is complete virtue (that is, courage, justice, moderation, and\nwisdom, rather than courage alone). In fact, the Athenian says that\nthe complete virtue of the citizens as a whole should be the single\ngoal of the lawgiver (Laws 630C3\u20136; see also e.g.,\n705D3\u2013706A4,\n 963A).[4]\n The Athenian also tells us that laws are true laws insofar as they\npromote the happiness (eudaimonia) of the citizens\n(Laws 631B; see also 715B, 743C\u2013D). Immediately after\nhe first makes this latter claim, he draws a distinction between human\nand divine goods and tells us that the human goods \u2013 like wealth\nand health \u2013 are dependent upon the divine goods, of which\nwisdom is first, then moderation, then justice, and finally courage;\nhe later describes this dependency by saying that the human goods are\ngood for someone who is virtuous but bad for bad men (Laws\n661B\u2013C). The dependency thesis helps Plato bring together the\ntwo characterizations of the goal of the laws in terms of the\ncitizens\u2019 virtue and happiness, respectively: if virtue is\nnecessary for benefit and thus for happiness, promoting the happiness\nof the citizens will require making them virtuous. This dependency\nthesis, as well as the dual characterization of the goal of the laws,\nraises but leaves unanswered questions about the precise relation\nbetween virtue and happiness, however: for example, is virtue actually\nsufficient for happiness, or is it simply\n necessary?[5]\n\nThe remainder of Book 1 is concerned with ethical psychology and\neducation: that is, with beginning the project of showing how a city\ncould produce citizens who possess complete virtue. This discussion\nheavily emphasizes the importance of feeling pleasure and pain\ncorrectly; the Athenian, in fact, claims that \u201c[For] human\nbeings who inquire into laws almost their entire inquiry concerns\npleasures and pains, in cities and in private dispositions. These two\nsprings flow forth by nature, and he who draws from the right one, at\nthe right time, and in the right amount is happy.\u201d\n(Laws 636D5\u2013E1). This phase of the discussion begins\nwith the Athenian announcing his intention to discuss the institutions\nwhich promote courage, which he swiftly notes should cover the ability\nto resist pleasure in addition to the ability to resist pain. He\nproposes controlled symposia (drinking parties) as the institution\nwhich will train this ability to resist pleasure, to the surprise of\nhis interlocutors. As this sort of training will serve as an important\npart of ethical education, this suggestion leads the Athenian to\ndiscuss education in general. Education involves the direction of a\nchild\u2019s pleasures, desires, and love towards his adult\noccupation; in the case of the citizens, education must draw their\nsouls to a desire and love of being a perfect citizen who rules and is\nruled in accordance with justice (Laws 643C\u2013D).\nPleasure is clearly central to the account of ethical psychology and\neducation in the Laws, and one important question to ask of\nthe Laws is why this is so. Is coming to have the correct\npleasures simply of instrumental value (insofar as it blocks one route\nto akratic action and vice or focuses the child on the things which he\nmust come to find valuable), or are at least some of these pleasures\ngood in their own right, e.g. in virtue of their\n contents?[6]\n\nThe discussion of Book 1 closes with a model of the soul which, the\nAthenian says, will make it clearer what virtue and vice are, and will\nhelp us to understand what effects various sorts of educational\npractices, such as the symposia, should be expected to have on the\nhuman soul (Laws\n 645C).[7]\n The model is one of a puppet\n (thauma)[8]\n made by the gods, possessing three cords, two, hard and iron,\nrepresenting the expectations of pleasure and pain, and one, soft and\ngold, representing reason or calculation (Laws 644D). This\nmodel differs in noteworthy ways from the image of the soul as\ncomposed of a human, a lion, and a hydra-headed beast in the\nRepublic and the charioteer and two horses of the\n Phaedrus.[9]\n The three elements in the puppet image are affections rather\nthan possessors of affections; and the most important\ndivision here is between the two iron cords and the golden cord, with\nno fundamental difference (of the sort that we see when spirit is\ncalled reason\u2019s natural ally in the Republic) between\nthe two iron cords. How to explain the differences in the model of the\nsoul that we get here from the ones we get in other dialogues is\nanother important question for interpreters of the\n Laws.[10]\nBook 2\n\nBook 2 begins by returning to the definition of education; the\nAthenian here tells us that education consists in training a child to\nfeel pleasure and pain, and to love and hate, correctly, before he can\nunderstand the reason why (Laws 653B\u2013C). Education in\nmusic and gymnastics is particularly crucial for the project of\nethical education. The Athenian tells us that young children naturally\ndesire to move and to make noise, and are naturally capable of taking\npleasure in order in movement and sound (Laws\n653D\u2013654A); one explanation for the centrality of music and\ngymnastics in the educational program, then, could appeal to the role\nof music and gymnastics in training this capacity to perceive and take\npleasure in\n order.[11]\n Book 2 focuses primarily on musical education and the standard of\ncorrectness in music; Book 7 returns to the topic of education in\ngymnastics, and lays out the rest of the educational program. These\ntopics will be discussed further in section 7 of this article (Poetry\nand Education).\n\nPart of the discussion of poetry in Book 2 deals with its content. The\nAthenian praises the Spartans and the Cretans for compelling poets to\nteach that the good man is happy and for giving no attention to the\nbad man; he also asserts that the poet ought also to teach that human\ngoods are dependent upon virtue and that the most pleasant life, the\nmost just life, and the happiest (most eudaim\u00f4n) life\ncoincide (Laws 662C\u2013E). This latter doctrine has great\nsignificance given that, as the Athenian says next, no man will\nvoluntarily do anything unless it involves more pleasure than pain;\nthis passage has also been thought to provide evidence that Plato\nremains a rational eudaimonist in the\n Laws.[12]\n The Athenian tells us that the views that the poet is to be compelled\nto espouse are both most true and most useful for persuading the\ncitizens to live virtuously (Laws 664C).\nBook 3\n\nBook 3 abruptly moves to a discussion of the origin of government,\nbeginning from the disorganized condition in which human beings would\nhave been left after one of the great catastrophes which the Athenian\ntakes to have destroyed human society over and over again. After\ndescribing how cities would have first come about out of this\ndisorder, the Athenian turns to the discussion of the histories of\nactual states. He first focuses on the histories of Sparta, Argos, and\nMessene, with particular attention to the features of the Spartan\nconstitution which saved it from the corruption which afflicted its\nneighbors. This discussion highlights the destructive power of\nignorance about what is to be valued (Laws 688C) and the\ndanger of entrusting too much power to a single, corruptible,\nindividual (Laws 691C\u2013D). The Athenian then turns to a\ndiscussion of Persia and Athens. The Athenian begins this discussion\nby reminding us that a lawgiver ought to aim at his city\u2019s being\nfree, wise, and a friend to itself (Laws 693B). He then\nclaims that there are two forms of constitution from which the rest\nare derived, monarchy and democracy, and attempts to show the virtues\nof the moderate forms, and the vices of the extreme forms, of each\nconstitution by considering Persia\u2019s development from a moderate\nto an extreme monarchy and Athens\u2019s development from a moderate\nto an extreme democracy. The moral of this discussion is that only a\nmixture of monarchy and democracy can allow a state to be both wise\nand free (Laws 693E) \u2013 a state which is strikingly\ncharacterized in the case of the earlier, more moderate form of\nAthenian democracy, as voluntary slavery to the laws (Laws\n 700A).[13]\n After this discussion has been completed, Kleinias announces that the\ndiscussion has had a practical point: he, along with nine others, is\nto craft laws for a new Cretan colony. He asks for the help of the\nAthenian and Megillus in building up the laws and institutions of this\nnew state, which is the project of the rest of the Laws.\nBook 4\n\nBook 4 opens with a discussion of the way in which the geographical\nlocation and features of the proposed city of Magnesia affect the ease\nor difficulty of creating a virtuous city. It then turns to consider\nthe method of settlement of the proposed city, and the practical\nchallenges of forming a group of settlers (whether they be from one or\nmany states) into a genuinely new society. Here, the Athenian suggests\nthat the easiest way to form new and good institutions in a society is\nfor it to be blessed with a good tyrant who wishes to create\ninstitutions conducing to virtue. The Athenian moves on to ask what\ntype of polity they ought to form; he answers by saying that the best\nruler a city can have is god, and that they ought to imitate the rule\nof god by ordering their city in obedience to reason, the immortal\nelement within themselves. These regulations set down by reason are to\nbe called law (Laws\n 714A).[14]\n\nThe Athenian then imagines their address to the new settlers. He\nbegins by emphasizing the power of god over human affairs and suggests\nthat each man ought therefore to become dear to god. The way to do\nthis, he says, is to come to be like god, i.e. to become virtuous\n(Laws 716A\u2013E). After discussing the worship of the gods\nand the veneration of parents, the Athenian pauses to reflect on the\nway in which the laws that he is beginning to describe are to make the\ncity happy (Laws 718B). He distinguishes between two methods\nof law-giving, one appropriate to free men and another to slaves,\nillustrating this by means of a distinction between a slave doctor who\nsimply prescribes what he thinks to be right to each of his patients,\nand a free doctor who investigates the ailment with his patient and\ninstructs him as to the nature of his disease as much as possible,\nprescribing a treatment only with the patient\u2019s consent\n(Laws 720A\u2013720E). The analogous method in the case of\nlaw-giving, the Athenian tells us, is to offer preludes to the laws\nthat aim at persuasion, and it is this method that he proposes to\nfollow in establishing the laws of Magnesia, condemning the\nalternative as the employment of mere force (Laws\n722B\u2013C). After illustrating this \u2018double method\u2019 in\nthe case of marriage laws, the three decide to proceed systematically\nfor the rest of the dialogue, giving first the preludes and then the\nlaws. Issues connected with the preludes will be discussed in greater\ndetail in section 5 (Preludes in the Laws).\nBook 5\n\nBook 5 continues the Great Prelude to the laws in general which\nstarted with the discussion of gods and ancestors in Book 4. The\nAthenian begins this next phase of the address by telling the citizens\nthat they ought to honor their souls above all their other\npossessions, as their souls are both most their own and the most\ndivine of all their possessions. To honor one\u2019s soul, he tells\nthem, is to follow virtue and, in general, good things, rather than to\nallow it to satisfy any desires and to enjoy any pleasures it might\nwant; and, at the end of the discussion, this ability of the soul to\nfollow the good is identified as that which explains why the soul is\nto be so highly honored. Next on the list comes the body, which ought\nto be honored by being put in a moderate state, as that is what best\nsupports the good state of the soul; third are money and property,\nwhich also ought to be held in moderation, for the same reason. After\na very brief discussion of relations with friends and strangers, the\nAthenian turns to the character of the person who leads the finest or\nmost noble (kallista) life. There, he describes various\npraiseworthy or blameworthy traits of character, before giving a\ngeneral warning to all citizens to avoid excessive self-love as\n\u201cthe greatest of all evils\u201d and \u201cthe cause of all of\neach man\u2019s wrongdoings on every occasion\u201d (Laws\n731D6\u2013E5). Instead, he encourages each citizen to love not\nhimself or his own possessions but rather what is just, whether it\nbelongs to himself or to someone else. This claim will be discussed\nfurther in section 9 (Ethics).\n\nThe prelude then moves from the \u201cdivine things\u201d with which\nit has been occupied to the \u201chuman things\u201d, chief among\nthem pleasure and pain, explaining that \u201cto these every mortal\nanimal is, as it were, inextricably attached and bound in the most\nserious ways\u201d (Laws 732E5\u20137). The Athenian then\nsets out the types of pleasures and pains which characterizes moderate\nand immoderate lives, with the aim of arguing that those which\ncharacterize the moderate life should be preferred and thus that the\nlife of virtue is the most pleasant life. This ends the Great Prelude\nto the laws in general, and the Athenian announces that they must now\nsketch the organization of the state (Laws 734E). The rest of\nBook 5 is concerned primarily with the citizens\u2019 properties\n\u2013 the number of households there shall be, the degree of\nvariance in wealth that the citizens shall be allowed to attain, and\nthe way that the citizens should engage with money \u2013 and with\njustifying those precepts with reference to the citizens\u2019\nhappiness. The rest of the Laws continues to describe and to\njustify the organization and the laws of this new city.\n",
