    "main_text": "Models of Disability || Medical and Social Models\n1.1 Medical and Social Models\n\nIn their extreme forms, the medical and social\nmodels serve to chart the space of possible relationships between\nbodily difference and functional limitation more than to reflect the\nactual views of individuals or institutions. (A variety of more formal\nmodels, described in Altman 2001, graphically represent the causal\ncomplexity of disability.)\n\nThe medical model explains disability disadvantage in terms\nof pathological states of the body and mind themselves. It regards the\nlimitations faced by people with disabilities as resulting primarily\nfrom their bodily differences. The medical model is rarely defended\nexplicitly, but aspects of it are often adopted unreflectively, when\nhealth care professionals, bioethicists, and philosophers ignore or\nunderestimate the contribution of social and other environmental\nfactors to the limitations faced by people with disabilities.\n\nIn contrast, the social model explains the characteristic\nfeatures of disability in terms of a relation between an individual\nand her social environment: the exclusion of people with certain\nphysical and mental characteristics, or \u201cimpairments\u201d,\nfrom major domains of social life. Their exclusion is manifested not\nonly in deliberate segregation, but in a built environment and\norganized social activity that preclude or restrict the participation\nof people seen or labeled as having disabilities. A variety of social\nmodels are embraced by disability scholars and activists in and\noutside of philosophy. The \u201cBritish social model\u201d\nassociated with the Union of the Physically Impaired against\nSegregation (UPIAS 1976) appears to deny any causal role to impairment\nin disability:\n\n\nIn our view, it is society which disables physically impaired\npeople. Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments\nby the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full\nparticipation in society. Disabled people are therefore an oppressed\ngroup in society. Disability [is] the disadvantage or restriction of\nactivity caused by a contemporary social organization which takes no\nor little account of people who have physical impairments and thus\nexcludes them from participation in the mainstream of social\nactivities.\n\n\nTwo features of this influential statement are worth noting, although\nwe will only discuss the second at length. First, it limits itself to\nphysical impairments; second, it contrasts\nimpairments, individual characteristics or conditions, with\ndisabilities, disadvantages imposed by society on those with\nimpairments. The first feature inaugurates a long tradition in\ndisability activism and scholarship of focusing exclusively on\n\u201cphysical\u201d disability, to the neglect, if not the\nexclusion, of intellectual, psychiatric, and other\n\u201cmental\u201d disabilities. Both scholars and activists have\nlong criticized, and sought to broaden, this narrow focus, and even\nthose philosophers who continue to focus on physical disability\nrecognize that adequate models and definitions must include mental\ndisabilities as well. In the rest of this entry, we will not\ndistinguish between the two types of disability except when it is\nrelevant to a particular model or definition; we will note when an\naccount is limited to physical disabilities or criticizes other\naccounts for that limitation.\n\nThe second feature, the distinction between impairment and disability,\nwill be more central to our discussion. It is through those terms that\nthe medical and social models have been distinguished, and it is this\n\u201canatomy\u201d of disability that several recent philosophical\ndefinitions have rejected or significantly modified.\n\nImplicit in the UPIAS understanding of disability are two ways that\nsociety imposes limitations on disabled people, corresponding to two\ndistinct strands that might be a part of any social model. When the\nUPIAS claims that society \u201cexcludes\u201d people with\nimpairments, this suggests the minority group model, which\nsees people with impairments as a minority population subject to\nstigmatization and exclusion. On this view, the main reason people\nwith disabilities encounter hardship is because they suffer\ndiscrimination along the same lines as racial or ethnic minorities.\nAccordingly, civil rights protections and anti-discrimination laws are\nthe proper responses to disability (e.g., Hahn 1987 [1997] and Oliver\n1990). Perhaps the most familiar expression of the minority-group\nmodel is found in the preamble to the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(ADA), which describes people with disabilities as \u201ca discrete\nand insular minority\u201d\u2014an explicit invocation of the legal\ncharacterization of racial minorities.\n\nThe UPIAS also asserts that \u201ccontemporary social\norganization\u201d fails to \u201ctake into account\u201d people\nwith disabilities. This suggests the human variation model,\naccording to which many of the challenges faced by disabled people do\nnot result from their deliberate exclusion, but from a mismatch\nbetween their characteristics and the physical and social environment.\nOn this view, disability is\n\n\nan extension of the variability in physical and mental attributes\nbeyond the present\u2014but not the potential\u2014ability of social\ninstitutions to routinely respond. (Scotch & Schriner 1997)\n\n\nThis view of disabilities as the result of human variations is closely\nrelated to the view that disability is a universal human condition\n(Zola 1989) or shared human identity (L. Davis 2002: Ch. 1). The claim\nthat disability is universal can be taken as nothing more than a\nprediction that we will all acquire familiar disabilities at some\npoint in our lives. But that claim is better construed as one about\nthe nature of disability; as maintaining that all human beings have\nphysical or mental variations that can become a source of\nvulnerability or disadvantage in some settings.\n\nThese two versions of the social model are not incompatible, differing\nmainly in emphasis. The discrimination stressed by the minority group\nmodel generally leads to, and is expressed in, the societal failure to\naccommodate people with various differences. In some contexts, it is\nappropriate to analogize people with disabilities to racial or other\nminorities; in others, it is important to reject a dichotomy between\ndisability and normality and treat impairments as continuous\nvariations. If one goal of social policy is to remove discrimination\nand its enduring disadvantages, another is to encompass the full range\nof human variation in the design of the physical environment and\nsocial practices.\n\nAlthough the social model, in one version or another, is now the\ndominant legislative, social-science, and humanities paradigm for\nunderstanding disability, stronger versions of it \u2013 particularly\nthe British Social Model exemplified by UPIAS \u2013 have been\nsubject to extensive criticism. Some argue that an adequate\nconceptualization of disability requires a recognition of impairments\nas an objective basis for classification, to distinguish disability\ndiscrimination from other types of discrimination (Bickenbach 1993).\nSeveral critics argue that extreme versions of the model implausibly\ndeny or understate the role of impairment itself as a source of\ndisadvantage (Anastasiou & Kauffman 2013; Terzi, 2004, 2009;\nShakespeare 2006). Others, however, contend that this criticism is\nmisplaced, because the British Social Model does not deny the\nimportance of impairments but rather seeks to restrict the application\nof the term \u201cdisability\u201d to social exclusion and\noppression (Beaudry 2016).\n\nAnother objection is that the social as well as the medical model both\nrest on a false dichotomy between biological impairments and social\nlimitations. There are two versions of this objection. One maintains\nthat disability is a complex phenomenon, in which biological\nimpairment and social exclusion are deeply interwoven and difficult to\ntease apart (Martiny 2015; Anastasiou & Kauffman 2013). The other\nversion of this objection rejects the treatment of impairment as a\n(strictly) biological phenomenon. \u201cImpairment\u201d, the\nargument goes, is no less a social construction than the barriers\nfaced by people so classified (more on this below). Claims that there\nis a stable biomedical basis for classifying a variation as an\nimpairment are called into question by shifting classifications; by\nthe \u201cmedicalization\u201d of some conditions (shyness) and\n\u201cdemedicalization\u201d of others (homosexuality). Moreover,\nthe social environment appears to play a significant role in\nidentifying and, arguably, in constituting some impairments (dyslexia)\n(Cole 2007; Shakespeare 2006; L. Davis 2002: Ch 1; Tremain, 2001,\n2017; Amundson 2000). What counts as an impairment may depend on which\nvariations appear to be disadvantageous in familiar or salient\nenvironments, or on which variations are subject to social prejudice:\nLess-than-average height may be more readily classified as an\nimpairment than greater-than-average height because the former is more\noften disadvantageous in environments designed for people of average\nheight, or because it is generally seen as less desirable. For such\nreasons, it is difficult to establish the objectivity of the\nimpairment classification by appeal to a clear and undisputed\nbiomedical norm. Amundson (2000), indeed, goes so far as to deny that\nthere is any biological basis for a concept of functional\nnormality\u2014a claim emphatically rejected by Boorse (2010).\n",
