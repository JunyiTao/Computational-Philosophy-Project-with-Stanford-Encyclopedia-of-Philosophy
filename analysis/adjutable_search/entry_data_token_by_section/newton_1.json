    "main_text": "Newton's Life || Newton's Early Years\n1.1 Newton's Early Years\n\n\nNewton was born into a Puritan family in Woolsthorpe, a small village\nin Linconshire near Grantham, on 25 December 1642 (old calendar), a few\ndays short of one year after Galileo died. Isaac's father, a\nfarmer, died two months before Isaac was born. When his mother\nHannah married the 63 year old Barnabas Smith three years later and\nmoved to her new husband's residence, Isaac was left behind with his\nmaternal grandparents. (Isaac learned to read and write from his\nmaternal grandmother and mother, both of whom, unlike his father, were\nliterate.) Hannah returned to Woolsthorpe with three new children in\n1653, after Smith died. Two years later Isaac went to boarding\nschool in Grantham, returning full time to manage the farm, not very\nsuccessfully, in 1659. Hannah's brother, who had received an M.A.\nfrom Cambridge, and the headmaster of the Grantham school then\npersuaded his mother that Isaac should prepare for the\nuniversity. After further schooling at Grantham, he entered\nTrinity College in 1661, somewhat older than most of his\nclassmates.\n\n\nThese years of Newton's youth were the most turbulent in the history of\nEngland. The English Civil War had begun in 1642, King Charles\nwas beheaded in 1649, Oliver Cromwell ruled as lord protector from 1653\nuntil he died in 1658, followed by his son Richard from 1658 to 1659,\nleading to the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II in\n1660. How much the political turmoil of these years affected\nNewton and his family is unclear, but the effect on Cambridge and other\nuniversities was substantial, if only through unshackling them for a\nperiod from the control of the Anglican Catholic Church. The\nreturn of this control with the restoration was a key factor inducing\nsuch figures as Robert Boyle to turn to Charles II for support for what\nin 1660 emerged as the Royal Society of London. The intellectual\nworld of England at the time Newton matriculated to Cambridge was thus\nvery different from what it was when he was born.\n",
