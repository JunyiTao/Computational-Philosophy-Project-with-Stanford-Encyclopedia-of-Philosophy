    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy: Theory of the Idols and the System of Sciences || The Idols\n3.1 The Idols\n\n\nBacon's doctrine of the idols not only represents a stage in\nthe history of theories of error (Brandt 1979) but also functions as\nan important theoretical element within the rise of modern empiricism.\nAccording to Bacon, the human mind is not a tabula rasa.\nInstead of an ideal plane for receiving an image of the world in toto,\nit is a crooked mirror, on account of implicit distortions (Bacon IV\n[1901], 428\u201334). He does not sketch a basic epistemology but\nunderlines that the images in our mind right from the beginning do not\nrender an objective picture of the true objects. Consequently, we have\nto improve our mind, i.e., free it from the idols, before we start any\nknowledge acquisition.\n\n\nAs early as Temporis partus masculus, Bacon warns the\nstudent of empirical science not to tackle the complexities of his\nsubject without purging the mind of its idols: \n\nOn waxen tablets\nyou cannot write anything new until you rub out the old. With the mind\nit is not so; there you cannot rub out the old till you have written in\nthe new. (Farrington 1964, 72)\n\n\nIn Redargutio Philosophiarum Bacon reflects on his method,\nbut he also criticizes prejudices and false opinions, especially the\nsystem of speculation established by theologians, as an obstacle to the\nprogress of science (Farrington 1964, 107), together with any\nauthoritarian stance in scholarly matters.\n\n\nBacon deals with the idols in the Second Book of The Advancement\nof Learning, where he discusses Arts intellectual\n(Invention, Judgment, Memory, Tradition). In his paragraph on judgment\nhe refers to proofs and demonstrations, especially to induction and\ninvention. When he comes to Aristotle's treatment of the\nsyllogism, he reflects on the relation between sophistical fallacies\n(Aristotle, De Sophisticis Elenchis) and the idols (Bacon III\n[1887], 392\u20136). Whereas induction, invention, and judgment\npresuppose \u201cthe same action of the mind\u201d, this is not true\nfor proof in the syllogism. Bacon, therefore, prefers his own\ninterpretatio naturae, repudiating elenches\nas modes of sophistical \u2018juggling\u2019 in order to persuade\nothers in redargutions (\u201cdegenerate and corrupt use\n\u2026 for caption and contradiction\u201d). There is no finding\nwithout proof and no proof without finding. But this is not true for\nthe syllogism, in which proof (syllogism: judgment of the consequent)\nand invention (of the \u2018mean\u2019 or middle term) are distinct.\nThe caution he suggests in relation to the ambiguities in\nelenches is also recommended in face of the idols:\n\nthere is yet a much more important and profound kind of\nfallacies in the mind of man, which I find not observed or enquired at\nall, and think good to place here, as that which of all others\nappertaineth most to rectify judgment: the force whereof is such, as it\ndoth not dazzle or snare the understanding in some particulars, but\ndoth more generally and inwardly infect and corrupt the state thereof.\nFor the mind of man is far from the nature of a clear and equal glass,\nwherein the beams of things should reflect according to their true\nincidence, nay, it is rather like an enchanted glass, full of\nsuperstition and imposture, if it be not delivered and reduced. For\nthis purpose, let us consider the false appearances that are imposed\nupon us by the general nature of the mind \u2026. (Bacon III\n[1887], 394\u20135)\n\n\nBacon still presents a similar line of argument to his reader in\n1623, namely in De Augmentis (Book V, Chap. 4; see Bacon IV\n[1901], 428\u201334). Judgment by syllogism presupposes\u2014in a\nmode agreeable to the human mind\u2014mediated proof, which, unlike\nin induction, does not start from sense in primary objects. In order to\ncontrol the workings of the mind, syllogistic judgment refers to a\nfixed frame of reference or principle of knowledge as the basis for\n\u201call the variety of disputations\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 491).\nThe reduction of propositions to principles leads to the middle term.\nBacon deals here with the art of judgment in order to assign a\nsystematic position to the idols. Within this art he distinguishes the\n\u2018Analytic\u2019 from the detection of fallacies (sophistical\nsyllogisms). Analytic works with \u201ctrue forms of consequences in\nargument\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 429), which become faulty by variation and\ndeflection. The complete doctrine of detection of fallacies, according\nto Bacon, contains three segments:\n\n Sophistical fallacies, \nFallacies of interpretation, and \n False appearances or Idols.\n\n\nConcerning (1) Bacon praises Aristotle for his excellent handling of\nthe matter, but he also mentions Plato honorably. Fallacies of\ninterpretation (2) refer to \u201cAdventitious Conditions or Adjuncts\nof Essences\u201d, similar to the predicaments, open to physical or\nlogical inquiry. He focuses his attention on the logical handling when\nhe relates the detection of fallacies of interpretation to the wrong\nuse of common and general notions, which leads to sophisms. In the last\nsection (3) Bacon finds a place for his idols, when he refers to the\ndetection of false appearances as \n\nthe deepest fallacies of the\nhuman mind: For they do not deceive in particulars, as the others do,\nby clouding and snaring the judgment; but by a corrupt and ill-ordered\npredisposition of mind, which as it were perverts and infects all the\nanticipations of the intellect. (IV, 431)\n\nIdols are productions of the human imagination (caused by the crooked\nmirror of the human mind) and thus are nothing more than\n\u201cuntested generalities\u201d (Malherbe 1996, 80).\n\n\nIn his Preface to the Novum Organum Bacon promises the\nintroduction of a new method, which will restore the senses to their\nformer rank (Bacon IV [1901], 17f.), begin the whole labor of the mind\nagain, and open two sources and two distributions of learning,\nconsisting of a method of cultivating the sciences and another of\ndiscovering them. This new beginning presupposes the discovery of the\nnatural obstacles to efficient scientific analysis, namely seeing\nthrough the idols, so that the mind's function as the subject of\nknowledge acquisition comes into focus (Brandt 1979, 19).\n\n\nAccording to Aphorism XXIII of the First Book, Bacon makes a\ndistinction between the Idols of the human mind and the Ideas of the\ndivine mind: whereas the former are for him nothing more than\n\u201ccertain empty dogmas\u201d, the latter show \u201cthe true\nsignatures and marks set upon the works of creation as they are found\nin nature\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 51).\n3.1.1 Idols of the Tribe\n\n\nThe Idols of the Tribe have their origin in the production of false\nconcepts due to human nature, because the structure of human\nunderstanding is like a crooked mirror, which causes distorted\nreflections (of things in the external world).\n3.1.2 Idols of the Cave\n\n\nThe Idols of the Cave consist of conceptions or doctrines which are\ndear to the individual who cherishes them, without possessing any\nevidence of their truth. These idols are due to the preconditioned\nsystem of every individual, comprising education, custom, or accidental\nor contingent experiences.\n3.1.3 Idols of the Market Place\n\n\nThese idols are based on false conceptions which are derived from\npublic human communication. They enter our minds quietly by a\ncombination of words and names, so that it comes to pass that not only\ndoes reason govern words, but words react on our understanding.\n3.1.4 Idols of the Theatre\n\n\nAccording to the insight that the world is a stage, the Idols of the\nTheatre are prejudices stemming from received or traditional\nphilosophical systems. These systems resemble plays in so far as they\nrender fictional worlds, which were never exposed to an experimental\ncheck or to a test by experience. The idols of the theatre thus have\ntheir origin in dogmatic philosophy or in wrong laws of\ndemonstration.\n\n\nBacon ends his presentation of the idols in Novum Organum,\nBook I, Aphorism LXVIII, with the remark that men should abjure and\nrenounce the qualities of idols, \u201cand the understanding [must be]\nthoroughly freed and cleansed\u201d (Bacon IV [1901], 69). He\ndiscusses the idols together with the problem of information gained\nthrough the senses, which must be corrected by the use of experiments\n(Bacon IV [1901], 27).\n",
