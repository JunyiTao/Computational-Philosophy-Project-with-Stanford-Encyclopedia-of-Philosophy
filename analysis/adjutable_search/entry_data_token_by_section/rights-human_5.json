    "main_text": "Which Rights are Human Rights? || Social Rights\n3.2 Social Rights\n\nThe Universal Declaration included social (or \u201cwelfare\u201d)\nrights that address matters such as education, food, health services,\nand employment. Their inclusion has been the source of much\ncontroversy (see Beetham 1995). The European Convention did not\ninclude them (although it was later amended to include the right to\neducation). Instead they were put into a separate treaty, the\n European Social Charter.\n When the United Nations began the process of putting the rights of\nthe Universal Declaration into international law, it followed the same\npattern by treating economic and social standards in a treaty separate\nfrom the one dealing with civil and political rights. This treaty, the\n International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights\n (the \u201cSocial Covenant,\u201d 1966), treated these standards as\nrights\u2014albeit rights to be progressively realized.\n\nThe Social Covenant\u2019s list of rights includes nondiscrimination\nand equality for women in economic and social life (Articles 2 and 3),\nfreedom to work and opportunities to work (Article 4), fair pay and\ndecent conditions of work (Article 7), the right to form trade unions\nand to strike (Article 8), social security (Article 9), special\nprotections for mothers and children (Article 10), the right to\nadequate food, clothing, and housing (Article 11), the right to basic\nhealth services (Article 12), the right to education (Article 13), and\nthe right to participate in cultural life and scientific progress\n(Article 15).\n\nArticle 2.1 of the Social Covenant sets out what each of the parties\ncommits itself to do about this list, namely to \u201ctake steps,\nindividually and through international assistance and\nco-operation\u2026to the maximum of its available resources, with a\nview to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights\nrecognized in the present Covenant.\u201d In contrast, the Civil and\nPolitical Covenant commits its signatories to immediate compliance, to\n\u201crespect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory\nthe rights recognized in the present Covenant\u201d (Article 2.1).\nThe contrast between these two levels of commitment has led some\npeople to suspect that economic and social rights are really just\nvaluable goals. Why did the Social Covenant opt for progressive\nimplementation and thereby treat its rights as being somewhat like\ngoals? The main reason is that many of the world\u2019s countries\nlacked the economic, institutional, and human resources to realize\nthese standards fully or even largely. For many countries,\nnoncompliance due to inability would have been certain if these\nstandards had been treated as immediately binding.\n\nSocial rights have often been defended with linkage arguments that\nshow the support they provide to adequate realization of civil and\npolitical rights. This approach was first developed philosophically by\nHenry Shue (Shue 1996; see also Nickel 2007 and 2016). Linkage\narguments defend controversial rights by showing the indispensable or\nhighly useful support they provide to uncontroversial rights. For\nexample, if a government succeeds in eliminating hunger and providing\neducation to everyone this promotes people\u2019s abilities to know,\nuse, and enjoy their liberties, due process rights, and rights of\npolitical participation. Lack of education is frequently a barrier to\nthe realization of civil and political rights because uneducated\npeople often do not know what rights they have and what they can do to\nuse and defend them. Lack of education is also a common barrier to\ndemocratic participation. Education and a minimum income make it\neasier for people near the bottom economically to follow politics,\nparticipate in political campaigns, and to spend the time and money\nneeded to go to the polls and vote.\n\nDo social rights yield a sufficient commitment to equality?\nObjections to social rights as human rights have come from both the\npolitical right and the political left. A common objection from the\nleft, including liberal egalitarians and socialists, is that social\nrights as enumerated in human rights documents and treaties provide\ntoo weak of a commitment to material equality (Moyn 2018; Gilabert\n2015). Realizing social rights requires a state that ensures to\neveryone an adequate minimum of resources in some key areas but that\ndoes not necessarily have strong commitments to equality of\nopportunity, to strong redistributive taxation, and to ceilings on\nwealth (see the entries\n equality,\n equality of opportunity,\n distributive justice,\n and\n liberal feminism).\n\nThe egalitarian objection cannot be that human rights documents and\ntreaties showed no concern for people living in poverty and misery.\nThat would be wildly false. One of the main purposes of including\nsocial rights in human rights documents and treaties was to promote\nserious efforts to combat poverty, lack of education, and unhealthy\nliving conditions in countries all around the world (see also Langford\n2013 on the UN Millennium Development Goals). The objection also cannot\nbe that human rights facilitated the hollowing out of systems of\nwelfare rights in many developed countries that occurred after 1980.\nThose cuts in welfare programs were often in violation of the\nrequirements of adequately realizing social rights.\n\nPerhaps it should be conceded that human rights documents and treaties\nhave not said enough about positive measures to promote equal\nopportunity in education and work. A positive right to equal\nopportunity, like the one Rawls proposed, would require countries to\ntake serious measures to reduce disparities between the opportunities\neffectively available to children of high-income and low-income\nparents (Rawls 1971).\n\nA strongly egalitarian political program is best pursued partially\nwithin but mostly beyond the human rights framework. One reason for\nthis is that the human rights movement will have better future\nprospects for acceptance and realization if it has widespread\npolitical support. That requires that the rights it endorses appeal to\npeople with a variety of political views ranging from center-left to\ncenter-right. Support from the broad political center will not emerge\nand survive if the human rights platform is perceived as mostly a\nleftist program.\n\nDo social rights protect sufficiently important human\ninterests? Maurice Cranston opposed social rights by suggesting\nthat social rights are mainly concerned with matters such as holidays\nwith pay that are not matters of deep and universal human interests\n(Cranston 1967, 1973. Treatments of objections to social rights\ninclude Beetham 1995; Howard 1987; and Nickel 2007). It is far from\nthe case, however, that most social rights pertain only to superficial\ninterests. Consider two examples: the right to an adequate standard of\nliving and the right to free public education. These rights require\ngovernments to try to remedy widespread and serious evils such as\nsevere poverty, starvation and malnutrition, and ignorance. The\nimportance of food and other basic material conditions of life is easy\nto show. These goods are essential to people\u2019s ability to live,\nfunction, and flourish. Without adequate access to these goods,\ninterests in life, health, and liberty are endangered and serious\nillness and death are probable. Lack of access to educational\nopportunities typically limits (both absolutely and comparatively)\npeople\u2019s abilities to participate fully and effectively in the\npolitical and economic life of their country. \n\nAre social rights too burdensome? Another objection to social\nrights is that they are too burdensome on their dutybearers. It is\nvery expensive to guarantee to everyone basic education and minimal\nmaterial conditions of life. Frequently the claim that social rights\nare too burdensome uses other, less controversial human rights as a\nstandard of comparison, and suggests that social rights are\nsubstantially more burdensome or expensive than liberty rights.\nSuppose that we use as a basis of comparison liberty rights such as\nfreedom of communication, association, and movement. These rights\nrequire both respect and protection from governments. And people\ncannot be adequately protected in their enjoyment of liberties such as\nthese unless they also have security and due process rights. The costs\nof liberty, as it were, include the costs of law and criminal justice.\nOnce we see this, liberty rights start to look a lot more costly. \n\nFurther, we should not generally think of social rights as simply\ngiving everyone a free supply of the goods they protect. Guarantees of\nthings like food and housing will be intolerably expensive and will\nundermine productivity if everyone simply receives a free supply. A\nviable system of social rights will require most people to provide\nthese goods for themselves and their families through work as long as\nthey are given the necessary opportunities, education, and\ninfrastructure. Government-implemented social rights provide\nguarantees of availability (or \u201csecure access\u201d), but\ngovernments should have to supply the requisite goods in only a small\nfraction of cases. Note that education is often an exception to this\nsince many countries provide free public education irrespective of\nability to pay.\n\nCountries that do not accept and implement social rights still have to\nbear somehow the costs of providing for the needy since these\ncountries\u2014particularly if they recognize democratic rights of\npolitical participation\u2014are unlikely to find it tolerable to\nallow sizeable parts of the population to starve and be homeless. If\ngovernment does not supply food, clothing, and shelter to those unable\nto provide for themselves, then families, friends, and communities\nwill have to shoulder this burden. It is only in the last hundred or\nso years that government-sponsored social rights have taken over a\nsubstantial part of the burden of providing for the needy. The taxes\nassociated with social rights are partial replacements for other\nburdensome duties, namely the duties of families and communities to\nprovide adequate care for the unemployed, sick, disabled, and aged.\nDeciding whether to implement social rights is not a matter of\ndeciding whether to bear such burdens, but rather of deciding whether\nto continue with total reliance on a system of informal provision that\ndistributes assistance in a very spotty way and whose costs fall very\nunevenly on families, friends, and communities.\n\nAre social rights feasible worldwide? Another objection to\nsocial rights alleges that they are not feasible in many countries (on\nhow to understand feasibility see Gilabert 2009). It is very expensive\nto provide guarantees of subsistence, measures to protect and restore\npeople\u2019s health, and education. Many governments will be unable\nto provide these guarantees while meeting other important\nresponsibilities. Rights are not magical sources of supply (Holmes and\nSunstein 1999).\n\nAs we saw earlier, the Social Covenant dealt with the issue of\nfeasibility by calling for progressive implementation, that is,\nimplementation as financial and other resources permit. Does this view\nof implementation turn social rights into high-priority goals? And if\nso, is that a bad thing?\n\nStandards that outrun the abilities of many of their addressees are\ngood candidates for treatment as goals. Viewing them as largely\naspirational rather than as imposing immediate duties avoids problems\nof inability-based noncompliance. One may worry, however, that this is\ntoo much of a demotion for social rights because goals seem much\nweaker than rights. But goals can be formulated in ways that make them\nmore like rights. They can be assigned addressees (the parties who are\nto pursue the goal), beneficiaries, scopes that define the objective\nto be pursued, and a high level of priority (see Langford 2013 and\nNickel 2013; see also\n UN Human Rights and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals).\n Strong reasons for the importance of these goals can be provided. And\nsupervisory bodies can monitor levels of progress and pressure\nlow-performing addressees to attend to and work on their goals.\n\nTreating very demanding rights as goals has several advantages. One is\nthat proposed goals that greatly exceed our abilities are not so\nfarcical as proposed duties that do so. Creating grand lists of social\nrights that many countries cannot presently realize seems farcical to\nmany people. Perhaps this perceived lack of realism is reduced if we\nunderstand that these \u201crights\u201d are really goals that\ncountries should seriously promote. Goals coexist easily with low\nlevels of ability to achieve them. Another advantage is that goals are\nflexible: addressees with different levels of ability can choose ways\nof pursuing the goals that suit their circumstances and means. Because\nof these attractions it may be worth exploring sophisticated ways to\ntransform very demanding human rights into goals. The transformation\nmay be full or partial. It is possible to create right-goal mixtures\nthat contain some mandatory elements and that therefore seem more like\nreal rights (see Brems 2009). A right-goal mixture might include some\nrights-like goals, some mandatory steps to be taken immediately, and\nduties to realize the rights-like goals as quickly as possible. \n",
