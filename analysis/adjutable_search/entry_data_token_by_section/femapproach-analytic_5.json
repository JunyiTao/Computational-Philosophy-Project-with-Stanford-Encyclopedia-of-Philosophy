    "main_text": "Characteristics of Analytic Feminism || Bridge Building\n4.2 Bridge Building\n\nAnalytic feminists\u2019 use of these toolkits and concepts and their\nfeminist reading of the work of traditional analytic philosophers\nallow them to converse with and build bridges among different groups\nof scholars, for example, traditional analytic philosophers, other\nfeminist philosophers, and, in some cases, scientists or scholars in\nsocial studies of science. This is sometimes an explicit goal of their\nwork (see Fricker and Hornsby 2000, 4\u20135 and Superson 2011), but\nis more often implied. Two analytic feminist philosophers of science\nfor whom this is an explicit goal are Lynn Hankinson Nelson and Helen\nLongino. Nelson sees her work in feminist empiricism that builds upon\nQuine as a way to engage philosophers of science, scientists and\nfeminists in constructive conversation (Nelson 1990 and subsequent\nessays, e.g., 1996). Longino, in The Fate of Knowledge (2002)\ntakes bold steps to dissolve the rational-social dichotomy by\nuntangling the assumptions made by social and cultural studies of\nscience scholars, historians and philosophers of science, and\nscientists. Interestingly, Longino\u2019s 2002 and 2013 books are not\ncast in \u201cfeminist\u201d terms, but build on her overtly\nfeminist work from the 1980s and 1990s and are informed by many\ndecades of feminist philosophy conversations.\n\nAnalytic feminists\u2019 styles of writing also have implications for\nbridge building. Because analytic feminists value explicit\nargumentation and clear, literal, and precise uses of language their\nwork \u201clooks like philosophy\u201d to nonfeminist analytic\nphilosophers; it makes nonfeminist philosophers feel more comfortable\nengaging in feminist discussion. At the same time, feminist\nphilosophers from various philosophical traditions often engage with\neach other\u2019s work outside their own \u201cpreferred\nmethod\u201d because of feminists\u2019 shared values and goals.\nThus non-analytic feminists who might find an analytic writing style\ntediously overqualified or otherwise confining still\nengage\u2014along with nonfeminist analytic philosophers\u2014in\nfruitful bridge-building conversations. Editors of analytic feminist\nanthologies and special issues of journals often have explicit\nbridge-building intentions that rest both on authors\u2019 style and\n content.[6]\n Examples of anthologies and journal issues that tie well with\ntraditional analytic philosophy are Antony and Witt (1993 [2002]),\nCudd and Klenk (1995), Haslanger (1995a), Fricker and Hornsby (2000),\nSuperson and Brennan (2005), Crasnow and Superson (2012), and Garavaso\n(2018); examples of books or symposia that intentionally build bridges\nacross feminist methods include Superson (2003), Witt (2011b), Garry,\nKhader, and Stone (2017).\n",
