    "main_text": "The Truthmaker Defense\n5. The Truthmaker Defense\n\nProponents of DDS affirm such sentences as \u2018God is his\nomniscience\u2019 and\u2018God is his omnipotence.\u2019 If the\nsingular terms \u2018his omniscience\u2019 and \u2018his\nomnipotence\u2019 in such sentences are taken to refer to properties,\nthen such sentences assert the identity of God and a property, an\nexemplifiable entity. This is unacceptable for the reasons rehearsed\nin section 2 above. Briefly, God is an individual and not a property.\nIf, however, the singular terms in question could be taken to refer to\nindividuals, then this particular objection to the coherence of DDS\nwould collapse. Clearly, if \u2018God\u2019 and \u2018his\nomniscience\u2019 both refer to an individual, God, then the\ncoherence of \u2018God is his omniscience\u2019 will be beyond\nquestion.\n\nEnter the truthmaker defense. The truthmaker defense hinges on a\ntheory of predication that Bergmann and Brower (2006) put as\nfollows:\n\nP*: The truth of all true predications, or at least of all\ntrue predications of the form \u2018a is F,\u2019\nis to be explained in terms of truthmakers.\n\n\nP* is to be understood by contrast to a theory of predication\naccording to which every true predication of the form\n\u2018a is F\u2019 is to be explained in terms of\nan individual\u2019s exemplifying of a property. Now consider the\nessential predication, \u2018God is omniscient.\u2019 Given that a\ntruthmaker of a truth t is an entity whose existence broadly\nlogically necessitates the truth of t, God himself is\nplausibly viewed as the truthmaker of \u2018God is omniscient\u2019\nand like essential predications. For in every possible world in which\nGod exists, these essential predications (or the propositions they\nexpress) are true. In the case of essential as opposed to accidental\npredications, truthmakers need not be taken to be concrete states of\naffairs, and so need not be taken as involving exemplifiable entities.\nSocrates himself is not plausibly taken to be the truthmaker of the\naccidental \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019 (or the proposition it\nexpresses) because there are possible worlds in which Socrates exists\nbut the predication is not true; Socrates is, however, plausibly taken\nto be the truthmaker of the essential \u2018Socrates is\nhuman.\u2019\n\nNow \u2018God\u2019s omniscience\u2019 and \u2018Socrates\u2019\nhumanity\u2019 are abstract nominalizations of \u2018God is\nomniscient\u2019 and \u2018Socrates is human,\u2019 respectively.\nSo given that God and Socrates are the truthmakers of the respective\nessential predications, the nominalizations can be taken to refer, not\nto properties, but to these very same truthmakers. Accordingly, to say\nthat God is identical to his omniscience is just to say that God is\nidentical to the truthmaker of \u2018God is omniscient.\u2019 And\nthat amounts to saying that God is identical to God. In this way one\navoids the absurdity of saying that God is identical to a property.\nWhat God is identical to is not the property of omniscience but the\nreferent of \u2018God\u2019s omniscience,\u2019 which turns out to\nbe God himself. And similarly for the rest of God\u2019s intrinsic\nand essential attributes.\n",
