    "main_text": "Implicatures and Game Theory || Signaling games\n2.1 Signaling games\n\nDavid Lewis (1969) introduced signaling games to explain how messages\ncan be used to communicate something, although these messages do not\nhave a pre-existing meaning. In pragmatics we want to do something\nsimilar: explain what is actually communicated by an expression whose\nactual interpretation is underspecified by its conventional semantic\nmeaning. To account for pragmatic inferences in game theory, Parikh\n(1991, 1992) introduced games of partial information. These games are\nmuch like Lewis\u2019s original signalling games, except that\nmessages are taken to have a conventional semantic meaning, and\nspeakers are assumed to say only messages that are true. In the\ninterest of a broad overview, we gloss over interesting but subtle\ndifferences between Lewis' signaling games and Parikh's games of\npartial information.\n\nA signaling game, then, is a game of asymmetric information between a\nsender \\(s\\) and a receiver \\(r\\). The sender observes the state \\(t\\)\nthat \\(s\\) and \\(r\\) are in, while the receiver has to perform an\naction. Sender \\(s\\) can try to influence the action taken by \\(r\\) by\nsending a message. \\(T\\) is the set of states, \\(F\\) the set of forms,\nor messages. The messages already have a semantic meaning, given by\nthe semantic interpretation function \\(\\llbracket \\cdot \\rrbracket\\)\nwhich assigns to each form a subset of \\(T\\). The sender will send a\nmessage/form in each state, a sender strategy \\(S\\) is thus a\nfunction from \\(T\\) to \\(F\\). The receiver will perform an action\nafter hearing a message with a particular semantic meaning, but for\npresent purposes we can think of actions simply as interpretations. A\nreceiver strategy \\(R\\) is then a function that maps a\nmessage to an interpretation, i.e., a subset of \\(T\\). A utility\nfunction for speaker and hearer represents what interlocutors\ncare about, and so the utility function models what speaker and hearer\nconsider to be relevant information (implementing Grice\u2019s Maxim\nof Relevance). For simplicity, it is normally assumed that the utility\nfunctions of \\(s\\) and \\(r (U_s\\) and \\(U_r)\\) are the same\n(implementing Grice\u2019s cooperative principle), and that they\ndepend on (i) the actual state \\(t\\), (ii) the receiver\u2019s\ninterpretation, \\(i\\), of the message \\(f\\) sent by \\(s\\) in \\(t\\)\naccording to their respective strategies \\(R\\) and \\(S\\), i.e., \\(i =\nR(S(t))\\), and (iii) (in section 2.3) the form \\(f = S(t)\\) used by\nthe sender. Nature is taken to pick the state according to some\n(commonly known) probability distribution \\(P\\) over \\(T\\). With\nrespect to this probability function, the expected, or average,\nutility of each sender-receiver strategy combination \\(\\langle\nS,R\\rangle\\) for player \\(e \\in \\{s,r\\}\\) can be determined as\nfollows: \n\n\\[ \\text{EU}_e (S,R)= \\sum_{t\\in T} P(t) \\times U_e (t,S(t),R(S(t))). \\]\n\n\nA signaling game is taken to be a (simplified, abstract) model of a\nsingle utterance and its interpretation, which includes some of the\narguably most relevant features of a context for pragmatic reasoning:\nan asymmetry of information (speaker knows the world state, hearer\ndoes not), a notion of utterance alternatives (in the set of\nmessages/forms) with associated semantic meaning, and a flexible\nrepresentation of what counts as relevant information (via utility\nfunctions). If this is not enough, e.g., if we want the listener to\nhave partial information not shared by the speaker as well (such as\nwhen the speaker is uncertain about what is really relevant for the\nlistener), that can easily be accommodated into a more complex game\nmodel, but we refrain from going more complex here. The strategies of\nsender and receiver encode particular ways of using and interpreting\nlanguage. The notion of expected utility evaluates how good ways of\nusing and interpreting language are (in the given context).\nGame-theoretic explanations of pragmatic phenomena aim to single out\nthose sender-receiver strategy pairs that correspond to empirically\nattested behavior as optimal and/or rational solution of the game\nproblem.\n\nThe standard solution concept of game theory is Nash\nequilibrium. A Nash equilibrium of a signaling game is a pair of\nstrategies \\(\\langle\\)S\\(^*\\),R\\(^*\\)\\(\\rangle\\)\nwhich has the property that neither the sender nor the receiver could\nincrease his or her expected utility by unilateral deviation. Thus,\nS\\(^*\\) is a best response to R\\(^*\\) and\nR\\(^*\\) is a best response to S\\(^*\\). There are\nplenty of refinements of Nash equilibrium in the game-theoretic\nliterature. Moreover, there are alternatives to equilibrium analyses,\nthe two most prominent of which are: (i) explicit formalizations of\nagents\u2019 reasoning processes, such as is done in epistemic game\ntheory (e.g., Perea 2012), and (ii) variants of evolutionary game\ntheory (e.g., Sandholm 2010) that study the dynamic changes in\nagents\u2019 behavioral disposition under gradual optimization\nprocedures, such as by imitation or learning from parents. These\nissues are relevant for applications to linguistic pragmatics as well,\nas we will demonstrate presently with the example of\nM-implicatures/Horn\u2019s division of pragmatic labor.\n",
