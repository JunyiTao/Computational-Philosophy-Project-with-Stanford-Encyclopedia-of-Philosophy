    "main_text": "Epistemology || Evaluation of the Disanalogy Arguments\n9.4 Evaluation of the Disanalogy Arguments\n\nAlthough Alston defends the perceptual character of mystical\nexperiences of God for his Doxastic Practice Approach, there is no\nrestriction that the experiential input of a doxastic\npractice must be perceptual in nature. Any cognitive input will do.\nHence, disanalogies between experiences of God and sense-perception,\neven if great, would not be directly harmful to this approach\n(Alston 1994).\n\nRegarding the bearing of the alleged disanalogies on the Argument from\nExperience, the disanalogists take the evidential credentials of\nsense-perception as paradigmatic for epistemology. They equate\nconfirming and disconfirming evidence only when evidence strongly\nanalogous to the kind for sensory perception is available. However,\nthe evidential requirement should be only \u201cconfirming\nexperiential evidence,\u201d be what it may. If God-sightings have\nconfirming evidence, even if different from the kind available for\ndualistic sense-perception, they will then be evidentially\nstrengthened. If God-sightings do not have much confirming empirical\nevidence, be it what it may, they will remain unjustified for that\nreason, and not because they lack cross-checks appropriate to\nsense-perception.\n\nPerhaps the justification of physical-object claims should not be\nour evidential standard since our ordinary physical-object\nbeliefs are far over-supported by confirming evidence. We have\nextremely large constellations of confirming networks there.\nHence, it does not follow that were mystical claims justified to a\nlesser degree than that, or not by similar procedures, that they would\nbe unjustified at all.\n\nA problem with the argument from God\u2019s lack of dimensionality is\nthat the practice of identifying physical objects proceeds by way of\nan interplay between qualitative features and relative positions to\ndetermine both location and identity. The judgments we make reflect a\nholistic practice of making identifications of place and identity\ntogether. There is no obvious reason why the identification of God\ncannot take place within its own holistic practice, with its own\ncriteria of identification, not beholden to the holistic practice\ninvolved in identifying physical objects.
