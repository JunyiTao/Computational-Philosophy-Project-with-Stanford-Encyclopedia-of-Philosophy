Other Related Writings\nAlthough none of Mill\u2019s other essays\u2014save, perhaps, \u201cThe Church, and Its Reform\u201d (1835)\u2014proved so controversial, each expands upon points made in passing in the Essay on Government. Jurisprudence deals extensively with rights\u2014what they are, by whom they are defined, and how they are best protected. In a similar vein and in a way that anticipates (and arguably influenced) the younger Mill\u2019s On Liberty (1859) Liberty of the Press defends the right of free speech and discussion against arguments in favor of restriction and censorship. Free government requires the free communication of ideas and opinions, and good government requires an informed and critical citizenry. For both, a free press is an indispensable instrument.\nIn the essay on Education Mill describes the conditions most conducive to creating good men and, more particularly, good citizens. Civic or \u201cpolitical education,\u201d he says, is \u201cthe key-stone of the arch; the strength of the whole depends upon it\u201d (Mill 1992, 193). Mill was fond of quoting Helvetius\u2019s dictum l\u2019\u00e9ducation peut tout (\u201ceducation makes everything possible\u201d). And certainly no other political thinker, save perhaps Plato and Thomas Jefferson, set greater store by education than did James Mill. As we discuss in Section 6, by \u201ceducation\u201d Mill meant not only domestic education or formal schooling, but all the influences that go into forming one\u2019s character and outlook, including the influence of social and political instituions.\nIn Prisons and Prison Discipline Mill applies his theory of education to penal reform. Just as one\u2019s character can be well moulded by a good education, so too may one\u2019s character be badly moulded through miseducation. The latter, Mill maintains, is especially evident in the criminal class. Criminals commit crimes and are sent to prison because they have been badly educated. Punishment, properly understood, is a kind of remedial education, and prison, properly structured, presents the opportunity to re-mould inmates\u2019 misshapen characters. Prisons and Prison Discipline delineates the types of punishments likely to deter offenders or, failing that, to re-mould and re-educate criminals to be productive members of society. In these and other respects Mill\u2019s theory of punishment mirrors Plato\u2019s. Like Plato, Mill draws a sharp distinction between punishing someone and harming him. The purpose of punishment is to reform (literally re-form) the soul or character of the inmate so that he may be released into society without fear that he will harm others. But to harm someone is to make him worse, and an even greater danger to society (Ball 1995, ch. 7).\nMill envisaged a society inhabited by active citizens, always on their guard against rulers or representatives who would violate their rights and deprive them of their liberties. This, after all, is the central theme of the Essay on Government, and the thrust of the argument of Mill\u2019s article The Ballot, published in 1830 as a contribution to the public debate preceding the passage of the 1832 Reform Act. Mixing logical acuity with withering ridicule, Mill restates and refutes arguments against extending the franchise and introducing the secret ballot. Only those with sinister interests could oppose such reform.\n6. The Essay on Education\nThe early nineteenth century in Britain was an age increasingly preoccupied with education, especially the public, though not state, provision of education for the lower ranks. Mill\u2019s educational activism in establishing schools for all commenced with his association with Bentham and Place (Burston 1973, ch. 3). For the next two decades, Mill and associates (including William Allen, Edward Wakefield, and Zachary Macaulay \u2013 the father of Mill\u2019s famous critic \u2013 as well as James Mackintosh \u2013 the recipient of Mill\u2019s 1835 harsh criticism) promoted the cause of public education at all levels, from Robert Owen\u2019s infant school to the projected Chrestomathic School in Bentham\u2019s garden and, famously, the University of London \u2013 that \u201cgodless school,\" the \u201cinfidel College in Gower street\u201d (The Standard, 19 June 1828 (issue 340), p. 2). And though Mill kept a low public profile in all these endeavors, \u201cit was always to him that recourse was had, when difficulties came\u201d (Bain 1882, 86).\nMill had put his pen to good use in Edinburgh Review, the Philanthropist and the Eclectic Review throughout the 1810s in the debate over the monitorial systems of Joseph Lancaster (in London endorsed by Mill and associates) and Andrew Bell (backed by the Church of England). However, his Essay on Education (originally published in 1819) bears no mark of that bitter controversy. Not only was Education, like Government, written in a deductive or synthetic style. But also, the abstract, theoretical treatment had important concrete, practical implications for social policy \u2013 implications at which, like Government, Mill only hinted rather than explicitly draw. There are further similarities between Education and Government. For example, even though Mill aimed at a comprehensive view of education, he confined himself \u201cto a skeleton\u201d (Mill 1992, 141). He also began his analysis by defining the subject-matter in connection to the pursuit of happiness. The end of education, he asserted, \u201cis to render the individual, as much as possible, an instrument of happiness, first to himself, and next to other beings\u201d (Mill 1992, 139). What\u2019s more, like Government, Education chose to underplay its Benthamite, radical or utilitarian pedigree. It was quite out of character, for a staunch Benthamite, to point out that wherein happiness \u201cconsists, [is] not yet determined\u201d (Mill 1992, 156), especially since happiness was identified as the end to which education aims.\nEducation, like Government, however, fooled no one where its author\u2019s loyalties lay. Twice Mill contrasted two \u201cclasses of philosophers\u201d: \u201cHartley and his followers in England, Condillac and his followers in France\u201d and \u201cDr Reid and his followers in this country, Kant and the German school of metaphysicians in general on the Continent.\u201d The first disagreement between these two sets of philosophers involved the range of what Mill called \u201csimple feelings.\u201d The first thought impressions and ideas the only simple or original feelings. Though often difficult to analyze a \u201ccomplex feeling\u201d to its constituent simple feelings, for this class of philosophers, perception came in advance of conception. The second class of philosophers did not think impressions and ideas the only \u201coriginal feelings,\u201d incapable of further analysis. They added a third category: \u201cthose [feelings] which correspond to the words remember, believe, judge, space, time, &c.\u201d For Mill, the third category of \u201coriginal feelings\u201d complicated analysis, and, consequently, education by blurring the lines (and order) between perception and conception (Mill 1992, 144). The second disagreement between these two sets of philosophers came up at the attempt to analyze the end of education. The first, Mill claimed, admitted a humble or corporeal origin of happiness, tracing happiness back to simple sensations and their transformation into ideas. For them, combinations of these simple feelings make up all the intellectual and moral phenomena of human nature. The second, Mill argued, go after happiness at a higher plane than \u201cthe grosser elements of sense.\u201d For these philosophers, the mind recognizes truth and right and wrong independently of human experience, \u201cwithout the aid of the senses\u201d (Mill 1992, 157). It was clear that Mill sided with the former philosophical group. However, for his purposes in Education the \u201cdivide\u201d between the a posteriori and a priori schools on this issue mattered little. It was sufficient that his readers assented to the link between happiness and education.\n6.1 Mill on the \u201cHuman Mind\u201d\nThe Essay on Education outlines and anticipates the main themes of Mill\u2019s Analysis, his most comprehensive inquiry into what his son would later call \u201cethology, or the science of character formation\u201d (A System of Logic, Book VI; Ball 2010). Since John Stuart Mill situated his father\u2019s Analysis in the debate between the \u201ca priori view of human knowledge, and of the knowing faculties\u201d and its \u201copposite doctrine\u2014that which derives all knowledge from experience, and all moral and intellectual qualities principally from the direction given to the associations,\u201d let\u2019s for a moment focus on this work. For the younger Mill, much like his own A System of Logic, his father\u2019s Analysis tried to combat a philosophical theory which made \u201cevery inveterate belief and every intense feeling, of which the origin is not remembered, [\u2026] into its own all-sufficient voucher and justification\u201d (J.S. Mill 1873, 233). In 1869, John Stuart Mill published a second edition of this essay with extended comments by himself, Alexander Bain, George Grote and Andrew Findlater, a noted philologist.\nFor James Mill, knowledge comes from sense experience. There are two kinds of sensations, he argued. The first kind is experienced when the object of sense is present. The sources of this kind of experience are the senses and the experience of those sensations which accompany muscle and digestive activity. The second kind is experienced when the object of sense is no longer present. Even after the sensation is gone, some sensory content, a \u201cbare fact,\u201d remains: \u201ca copy, an image, of the sensation, sometimes a representation, or trace, of the sensation,\" i.e. its idea (Mill 1829a, I.40\u201341). \u201c[D]uring the whole of our lives,\u201d James Mill argued, \u201ca series of those two states of consciousness, called sensations, and ideas, is constantly going on.\u201d He highlighted that ideas do not derive from objects but from sensations. And as sensations are either synchronous or successive, \u201c[o]ur ideas spring up, or exist, in the order in which the sensations existed,\u201d in space (simultaneous existence) and/or in time (antecedent and consequent existence) (Mill 1829a, I.52, 55\u201356).\nAssociation Psychology, as thus expounded, examines the links between experience as registered by a conscious mind and the ideas, or trains of ideas, which registered experience springs up. The strength or weakness of associations between a sensation and an idea or between ideas varies, depending on how permanent or vivid they are. Some associations are so firm and constant that they become indissoluble or inseparable, fusing the different aspects of the complex experience into a single cluster of associations. The vividness of a part of the cluster might engross the attention of the conscious mind. Sometimes the cluster is dominated by a sensation, sometimes by an idea. Generally speaking, Mill noted, sensations are more vivid than ideas, the painful or pleasurable sensations or ideas are more vivid than indifferent ones, and the more recent are more vivid than less recent ones (Mill 1829a, I.60\u201363). The perceiving mind attends only to a part of the sense experience, both at the moment of sensation and, consequently, in its copy, image or representation. In History of British India, Mill used this \u201claw\u201d of human nature to explain how a philosophic historian never had to set foot in a foreign country to write its history:\nIn a cursory survey, it is understood, that the mind, unable to attend to the whole of an infinite number of objects, attaches itself to a few; and overlooks the multitude that remain. But what, then, are the objects to which the mind, in such a situation, is in preference attracted? Those which fall in with the current of its own thoughts; those which accord with its former impressions; those which confirm its previous ideas.\nSifting through different testimonies of the same phenomenon, as a judge, one might thus compound a more comprehensive idea of it rather than by being an actual eye witness (Mill 1818, I.xii-xiv; Loizides 2019b).\nFor James Mill, the individual maintains some command over sensations (i.e. in a controlled environment) as they derive from sensible objects. However, one cannot recall ideas or trains of ideas at will, Mill pointed out: \u201cThoughts come into the mind unbidden.\u201d But ideas can be linked with sensible objects, such as sounds, smells, sights, and so on. Language thus provides signs, e.g. audible and visible, which mark sensations and recall ideas (Mill 1829a, I.86\u201389). This way knowledge acquired from the past can be used to guide the future. For example, certain words recall certain ideas and trains of ideas. These ideas or trains of ideas, with or without additional links, might lead to certain behavioral responses, e.g. thoughts, emotions, actions. Analyses of chains of associations identify the links between elicited responses (last step) and actual experience (first step). This is almost impossible to do in cases of indissoluble association, as sensations, ideas and trains of ideas are fused together indiscriminately. Hence, even though most children associate darkness with ghosts, Mill offered an example, \u201c[i]n some this association is soon dissolved,\u201d in others \u201cit continues for life,\u201d especially come the night (Mill 1829a, I.60, 286\u201387). Even a mind like Bentham\u2019s had failed to dissolve such an association.\n6.2 The Formation of Character\nMill\u2019s Education (and Analysis) was criticized for blending together two different projects: epistemology and psychology. The confusion, Wyndham Hedley Burston argued, was due to Mill\u2019s failure to acknowledge the synthetic/analytic or conceptual/empirical distinction (Burston 1973, chs. 5\u20136; Wilson 1990, ch. 4), a critique which was also levelled at his son\u2019s A System of Logic. However, given that epistemology concerns itself, not only with what knowledge is, but also with questions such as how it can be attained and with which cognitive processes do actually allow the attainment of knowledge, James Mill\u2019s enterprise in both Education and Analysis might not appear as suspect as on first glance from a philosophical point of view. Still, Mill\u2019s interest laid indeed primarily in the shaping of the mind, the beliefs, and the behavior of the \u201cknowing subject.\u201d His fundamental doctrine in psychology, his son reported, \u201cwas the formation of all human character by circumstances, through the universal Principle of Association, and the consequent unlimited possibility of improving the moral and intellectual condition of mankind by education\u201d (J.S. Mill 1873, 109, 111). For James Mill, education was all-powerful: \u201cif education does not perform every thing, there is hardly anything which it does not perform\u201d (Mill 1992, 160).\nMill\u2019s argument was straightforward: both individual and social wellbeing depends upon individual action. Actions depend upon one\u2019s feelings and thoughts (the last step in the chain of association prior to action). Education must thus be structured upon the \u201cknowledge of the sequences which take place in the human feelings or thought.\u201d Such knowledge enables the preceptor \u201cto make certain feelings or thoughts take place instead of others\u201d in the student. The kinds of mental succession, upon which education works, Mill urged, make \u201call the difference between the extreme of madness and of wickedness, and the greatest attainable heights of wisdom and virtue\u201d (Mill 1992, 147; Mill 1813a, 98). As one\u2019s bent of mind is revealed in the sequences of its ideas, the object of education is \u201cto provide for the constant production of certain sequences, rather than others,\u201d either through repetition and the inculcation of certain habits, or through association with ideas of pleasure or pain, including those of praise and blame (Mill 1992, 151).\nThe Essay on Education identified two sorts of circumstances that form character: physical and moral. Unlike moral circumstances, not all physical circumstances were amenable to human will. Still, Mill pointed out, the most important of them were: \u201call education is impotent\u201d unless nutrition and labor (and, consequently, health) are of appropriate quality and quantity. He pressed on the point that \u201cnature herself forbids that you shall make a wise and virtuous people, out of a starving\u201d or an over-worked people (Mill 1992, 172\u2013174). Especially as regards the latter, Mill painted a strikingly Platonic picture in 1813, discussing the influence of labor upon factory workers:\nShut up for almost the whole of that period of time which they pass without sleep, with their eyes and all their faculties exclusively fastened day after day upon one and the same narrow circle of objects and operations, their minds are accessible to a smaller number of ideas, and get less of any thing which can be called mental exercise, than any other set of human being, even than the savages in the forest (Mill 1813a, 94).\nThe \u201ceffects of their situation upon their minds are, if possible, still more deplorable\u201d than upon their body, he argued. \"[U]nless care is taken,\" he highlighted in Education, \"by means of the other instruments of education, to counteract\" these dreadful effects of economic progress, the minds \"of the great body of the people are in danger of really degenerating, while the other elements of civilization are advancing\" (Mill 1992, 173).\nAs far as the moral circumstances were concerned, rather than waste time debating final ends, Mill focused on accepted middle principles. The stable production of those mental sequences which fulfil the ends of education, he argued, depends upon cultivating four virtues: intelligence, temperance, justice and generosity. The first two promote individual well-being. Intelligence referred to \"bringing within our ken what is capable, and what is not capable of being used as means,\" but also \"seizing and combining, at the proper moment, whatever is the fittest as means to each particular end.\" More generally, rational practice requires a collection of observations of past acts, with a justified expectation (i.e. that similar causes produce similar effects) for specific results. Temperance entailed the ability of controlling one\u2019s appetites and desires, preventing them from leading to a \"hurtful direction,\" allowing the constant pursuit of what one \"deliberately approves.\" The latter two cardinal virtues, justice and generosity, promote social wellbeing, by avoiding doing harm and by doing positive good to others (i.e. acting supererogatorily) respectively. Of course, Mill insisted, that \"[i]n reality, as the happiness of the individual is bound up with that of his species, that which affects the happiness of the one, must also, in general, affect that of the other (Mill 1992, 154\u2013156, 179; Loizides 2019c).\n6.3 Education, Power and Liberty of the Press\nIn short, Mill thought character depends on \u201cthe direction given to the desires and passions of men.\u201d To this effect, the \u201cbusiness of good education\u201d is to associate the \u201cgrand objects of desire\u201d \u2013 e.g., wealth, power, dignity \u2013 with \u201cadmirable qualities\u201d in individuals (e.g. \u201cgreat intelligence, perfect self-command, and over-ruling benevolence\u201d), not wicked ones (e.g. \u201cflattery, back-biting, treachery\u201d) (Mill 1992, 193; Mill 1829a, II.245). Since the political (and legal) arrangements in a society are very powerful in solidifying such associations through various institutions and practices, \u201cPolitical Education\u201d is \u201cthe key-stone of the arch\u201d (Mill 1992, 193). Not only is government responsible for fostering proper habits and associations with good laws, justice and the eradication of corruption, according to Mill; but also, government should be held accountable when it failed to do so.\nGiven that \u201cour opinions are the fathers of our actions,\u201d Mill argued amidst the debate on parliamentary representation, it is vital that individuals do not take the opinions of others upon trust or let others choose for them what is in their interest to pursue. It was thus quite an important educational task to foster habits of examining the evidence which grounds opinions (Mill 1826, 10\u201311, 13\u201314; Mill 1992, 122, 126\u2013130). Inattention to evidence made the detection of fallacious thinking, lying underneath a host of prejudices, impossible. Especially since those \u201cwho stand on the vantage ground of power,\u201d Mill warned, had made an art of defending power through, what he called, \u201cthe logic of power\u201d: the misrepresentation of facts, suppression of evidence, begging the question, argument from authority, appealing to fear, and inter alia, ridicule (Mill 1824, 465). Due to the ever-present danger that political, legal and social institutions might foster \u201chabits of servility and toleration of arbitrary power,\u201d the \u201cLiberty of the Press\u201d is a vital counteracting social influence, and, for that reason, \u201can inestimable blessing\u201d to good government (Mill 1813b, 211\u2013212, Mill 1992, 117\u2013123; Grint 2017). The press functions thus as a sort of \u201chigh and constant observer\u201d of government acts (Mill 1992, 107) through apt diffusion of praise and blame to public functionaries.\n6.4 Education and Happiness\nJames Mill thought that \u201cof all the circumstances which affect the happiness, the beauty, and order, and well-being of society, by far the most important\u201d is individual character (Mill 1813a, 97). The shaping of character was no simple matter. From the domestic to the political sphere, many institutions played a part in the \u201celevation of the people\u201d: elevation \u201cabove ignorance, above swinishness, above prostitute servility, above oppression, above delusion religious or political, above grovelling vice, above subjection to the irrational passions\u201d (Mill 1813c, 345; Plassart 2008 and 2019). To adapt a famous Stoic idea, as we move from the inner to the outer concentric circles of affection and concern for one's self and for others, it becomes increasingly difficult (impossible even without conducive physical and moral circumstances), to abstain from doing harm or do positive good to others. As we saw, without strong associations, the knowing subject\u2019s mind hardly takes cognizance of the interests or even the existence of others outside the narrow circle of one's self, family, friends and associates.\nThe effects of misguided associations, Mill urged, require \u201cthe greatest attention in Education, and Morals\u201d: the \u201clove of our Fellow-creatures\u201d is \u201ccompletely impotent\u201d against the \u201clove of Wealth, or of Power.\u201d Good education strengthens virtuous motives so that they do not \u201cgive way, habitually, whenever they are opposed by any other motive even of moderate strength\u201d (Mill 1829a, II.241). As he put it:\nWhen the grand sources of felicity are formed into the leading and governing Ideas, each in its due and relative strength, Education has then performed its most perfect work; and thus the individual becomes, to the greatest degree, the source of utility to others, and of happiness to himself (Mill 1829a, II.303).\nOnly when one cares enough to sacrifice that \u201cpart of the self which the good of our species requires\u201d (Mill 1818, V.527) can individual exertion be directed towards the pursuit of social happiness. But it was a pursuit neither for the narrow-minded nor for the faint-hearted. For this reason, Mill thought that no great public good could \u201crest with safety on any thing so precarious, as the chance of extraordinary virtue in particular men\u201d (Mill 1816, 248). \u201cIs it according to the experience of human nature, that men with the powers of government in their hands are angels and have never any propensity to oppress?\u201d, he wondered (Mill 1813d, 464).\n7. Conclusion: Mill\u2019s Legacy\nIn\u00a01822, James Mackintosh found much that was admirable in Mill\u2019s essays on government and education. However, Mackintosh protested, they were founded on an erroneous method (Mackintosh to Napier, 1822). Less than a decade later, Macaulay devastatingly drew out the implications of that method for Mill\u2019s \u201cutilitarian logic and politics.\u201d In\u00a0 reviewing the quarrel between Mill and Macaulay today, the modern reader may well experience a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, not because the question of parliamentary reform remains relevant and timely, but because the epistemological and methodological questions raised by this debate are with us still. What is the nature of political knowledge, and how is it to be obtained? What sort of \u201cscience\u201d can \u201cpolitical science\u201d aspire to be? What is the connection between political theory and the practice of politics? Mill\u2019s answers rather resemble those of modern \u201crational choice\u201d theorists, and Macaulay\u2019s those of their empirically minded critics. After all, Mill maintains that any scientific theory worthy of the name must proceed from a finite set of assumptions about human nature, with the self-interest axiom at their center. From these one can deduce conclusions about the ways in which rational political actors will (or at any rate ought to) behave. Macaulay, by contrast, claims that people act for all sorts of reasons, including\u2014but by no means limited to\u2014considerations of self-interest.\nMill\u2019s Essay on Government\u2014and Macaulay\u2019s attack\u2014earned for its author an unenviable reputation as an egregious simplifier of complex matters. Yet Mill remained unrepentant since such simplification was, in his view, the very purpose and point of theorizing. After all, to theorize is to simplify. But, as his critics were quick to note, it is one thing to simplify and quite another to oversimplify. In a modern echo of Macaulay\u2019s estimate, Joseph Schumpeter contrasts Mill\u2019s \u201cmonumental, and indeed path-breaking, History of British India\u201d with the Essay on Government, which \u201ccan be described only as unrelieved nonsense\u201d because of its simplistic assumptions and its equally simplistic conclusions (Schumpeter 1954, 254). A more charitable estimate is provided by Brian Barry. Barry observes:\nThe results [of Mill\u2019s reasoning] may appear somewhat crude, and yet it seems to me a serious question whether James Mill\u2019s political theory is any more of an oversimplification than, say, Ricardo\u2019s economics. The difference is, of course, that Ricardo\u2019s ideas were refined by subsequent theorists, whereas James Mill\u2019s Essay on Government had no successors until the last decade or so (Barry 1970, 11).\nThese successors, on Barry\u2019s telling, include such rational choice theorists as Mancur Olson and Anthony Downs, amongst others. Alan Ryan concurs. Although \u201can eminently dislikable document,\u201d Ryan writes, Mill\u2019s Essay on Government \u201chas virtues that ought not to be neglected.\u201d One of these is that it \u201cstands at the head of a line of thought extending down to Joseph Schumpeter and Anthony Downs, a line of thought that provides many of the explicit or implicit assumptions with the aid of which we still practice political science\u201d (Ryan 1972, 82\u201383).\nAlthough right in one respect, Barry\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s reassessments are rather wide of the mark in another. It is true that there is, methodologically speaking, a family resemblance between Mill\u2019s axiomatic deductive reasoning in Government and, say, Anthony Downs\u2019s An Economic Theory of Democracy (1957). But it is important to note that Mill, unlike Downs and other ostensible successors of the rational choice school, was never content to interpret interests as wants, desires or \u201crevealed preferences.\u201d On the contrary, Mill was concerned with distinguishing between sinister and non-sinister interests, supplying causal explanations of their origins and development, rendering judgments about them, and attempting to alter the conditions that shape (or more often misshape) men\u2019s and women\u2019s characters. Hence his abiding interest in law, education, punishment, penology, psychology, and other avenues of \u201ccharacter-formation.\u201d Mill\u2019s aims were not only explanatory but critical, educative, and, by his lights, emancipatory. The point of almost everything he wrote\u2014from his massive \u201ccritical, or judging\u201d History of British India to the shortest essay\u2014was, to borrow a phrase from Marx, not merely to understand the world but to change it. Not for Mill the vaunted \u201cvalue-neutrality\u201d of modern social and political science.",
