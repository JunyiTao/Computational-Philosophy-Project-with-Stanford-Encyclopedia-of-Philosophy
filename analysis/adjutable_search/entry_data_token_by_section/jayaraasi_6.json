    "main_text": "The Method and Philosophy of Jayar\u0101\u015bi || Scepticism and Definitions\n2.3 Positive Views below).\n\nThere is also some external evidence corroborating to a certain degree\nthe thesis about C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata affiliation of\nJayar\u0101\u015bi. Vidy\u0101nanda who first mentions\nJayar\u0101\u015bi brings some interesting details to light (alluded\nto above). In his A\u1e63\u1e6da-\u015bat\u012b (A\u1e63S\n29.20\u201336.7), he explicitly indicates a category of nihilistic thinkers\nwho reject a number of vital principles and claim that \u2018There is\nno [reliable] omniscient authority (t\u012brtha-k\u0101ra), there is\nno [reliable] cognitive criterion (pram\u0101\u1e47a), there is no\n[reliable] authoritative doctrine (samaya) or [reliable] Vedas, or any\nkind of [reliable] reasoning (tarka), because they contradict each\nother,\u2019 and he quotes a popular verse: \u2018Reasoning is not\nestablished, testimonies differ, there is no sage whose words are a\ncognitive criterion (i.e., authoritative), the essence of the moral\nlaw (dharma) is concealed in a secret place (i.e., is not available).\nThe [proper] path is that taken by the majority of\n people\u2019[3].\n Whether the verse comes from an unidentified Lok\u0101yata source,\nwhich is not impossible, or not, it is echoed by Jayar\u0101\u015bi in\nthe above mentioned verse at the beginning of his work and the\nexpression \u2018the worldly path\u2019 (laukiko m\u0101rga\u1e25).\nInterestingly, the verse has an obvious sceptical underpinning. The\ncategory of such \u2018nihilists\u2019 includes (1) the followers of\nthe Lok\u0101yata school (lauk\u0101yatika, A\u1e63S 29.26), also\nknown as the C\u0101rv\u0101ka (A\u1e63S 30.25), who are associated\nwith the view that there is just one cognitive criterion, i.e.\nperception, and (2) the category of \u2018those who propound the\ndissolution of [all] categories\u2019\n(tattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din, A\u1e63S 31.2). Vidy\u0101nanda\n(A\u1e63S 31.2 ff.) explains who the latter are: \u2018Some who are\nthose who propound the dissolution of [all] categories take (1) all\nthe categories of cognitive criteria such as perception etc. and (2)\nall the categories of the cognoscibles as dissolved (i.e., not\nestablished)\u2019. Throughout his text, Vidy\u0101nanda keeps these\ntwo traditions \u2013 the Lok\u0101yata and the Tattv\u00f4paplava \u2014\nseparate, although he does acknowledge that they are genetically\nrelated, the main difference between them being whether one recognises\nat least one cognitive criterion (C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata)\nor none (Jayar\u0101\u015bi). Further on, Vidy\u0101nanda begins the\nexposition of materialism (A\u1e63S, p. 35.22 ff.) which is\ndesignated with a generic term \u2018cognitive criteria-free\nassumption\u2019 (apram\u0101\u1e47ik\u0101 \u2026\ni\u1e63\u1e6di), among which the first variety represents standard\nmaterialists who accept perception as the only cognitive criterion\n(A\u1e63S, p. 35.19\u201337.9), and the second variety concerns\n\u2018those who propound the dissolution of [all] categories\u2019\n(tattv\u00f4paplava-v\u0101din) who do not accept any cognitive\ncriteria (pram\u0101\u1e47a) (A\u1e63S, p. 37.10 ff.). Also\nAnantav\u012brya explicitly classifies Jayar\u0101\u015bi as a\nmaterialist by making a pun the the word c\u0101rv\u0101ka: \u2018The\nauthor of \u201c[The Lion Destroying] the Delusion of\nCategories\u2019\u201d says what is charmingly chastised by the\nC\u0101rv\u0101kas\u2019 (SVi\u1e6c, p. 277.19:\ntattv\u00f4paplava-k\u1e5bd \u0101ha \u2013\nc\u0101rv\u0101kai\u015b c\u0101ru carcitam\u2026).\n\nA typical charge against Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s affiliation to\nmaterialists (C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata), known for two main\nclaims \u2013 that there is only one cognitive criterion\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a), namely perception, and the four elements compose\nall the universe, including consciousness \u2013 would the apparent\nparadox: Jayar\u0101\u015bi seems to acknowledge neither. This led\nBhattacharya (2017: 353\u2013354) to dispute, on philologically\nimplausible grounds, that Jayar\u0101\u015bi refers to B\u1e5bhaspati\nand the B\u1e5bhaspati-s\u016btra as his own tradition. However, the\nearliest external recipients of Jayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s ideas, the\nJaina thinkers Vidy\u0101nanda and Anantav\u012brya, importantly\nascribe to Jayar\u0101\u015bi or to his immediate materialist\ntradition a saying that \u2018B\u1e5bhaspati\u2019s aphorisms are\nprimarily meant to refute the opponents with respect to all\n [issues].\u2019[4]\n This serves as an external evidence that Jayar\u0101\u015bi did\nacknowledge the authority of\u00a0 B\u1e5bhaspati and his aphorisms\nbut interpreted them in the spirit of his own methodological\nscepticism.\n\nThat there must have been some strain among the materialists prior to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi which both admitted that the world is composed of\nthe four elements and at the same time apparently doubted that there\nis any cognitive criterion (pram\u0101\u1e47a) is reflected by\nAkala\u1e45ka, who points to the following paradox such a materialist\nwould have to face: \u2018As a result of the absence of cognitive\ncriteria (pram\u0101\u1e47a) [the materialist] cannot ascertain that\nperception, and nothing else, is the only one [cognitive criterion],\nor [ascertain] the essence of cognoscible objects. Since, when other\ncognitive criteria are negated, a [proper] definition of perception\nbecomes inexplicable, what [cognoscible objects] by what [cognitive\ncriteria] could be established or negated, on account of which [one\ncould maintain that] the world is composed of the four\nelements?\u2019 (SVi 4.12, p. 272.3\u20135).\n\nOf significance is that Vidy\u0101nanda puts Jayar\u0101\u015bi on par\nwith the Buddhist doctrine of Emptiness (\u015b\u016bnya-v\u0101da),\nas represented by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, and with Ved\u0101ntic\nidealists (brahma-v\u0101da), as three kinds of self-refuting theories\n(T\u015aVA 80.22\u201381.14; 195.14\u201316). This might\ntheoretically be taken as evidence that all three represented\nscepticism. However, since there is no hint that Ved\u0101ntic\nidealists were sceptics at all at that\n time,[5]\n and we have strong evidence that Jayar\u0101\u015bi was not a\nsceptic, what Mills (2018) takes to be the three pillars of skepticism\nin classical India, namely N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, Jayar\u0101\u015bi and\n\u015arihar\u1e63a, represented here by a forerunner, cannot be\nclassified as sceptics, despite their commonalities, as noticed by\nVidy\u0101nanda.\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi can be therefore taken as a genuine representative\nof an offshoot of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata tradition,\nprimarily because he himself thought he was a follower of\nB\u1e5bhaspati\u2019s materialist tradition, and probably because he had\noriginally been trained in the materialist system. It also seems very\nlikely that the representatives of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka /\nLok\u0101yata system occasionally had sceptical inclinations prior to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi, which helped him to abandon typically materialist\nclaims and undertake his sceptical project. However, neither he nor\nhis work can be taken as typical representatives of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata school or a first-hand source of\ninformation about that tradition. Despite this, the work remains the\nonly authentic, albeit not \u2018orthodox\u2019 treatise of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka / Lok\u0101yata tradition that has come down to\nus.\n2. The Method and Philosophy of Jayar\u0101\u015bi\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi can be classified as a sceptic \u00a0only in a\nqualified sense (\u2018qualified sceptic\u2019), namely as a kind of\nmethodological sceptic, who consistently avails himself of a\nparticular method to analyse theories and the contents of\npropositions, but at the same time retains a set of positive\nbeliefs.\n2.1 Use of Reductio Arguments\n\nThe point of departure of his methodology is a sophisticated and\nhighly elaborated reductio type of argument (prasa\u1e45ga),\ndeveloped earlier within the Madhyamaka school of Buddhism and its\nprominent adherent Nag\u0101rjuna (c. 150 CE).\n\nIn his method, Jayar\u0101\u015bi analyses a particular thesis T of\nhis opponent by, first, listing all logical implications or all\ndoctrinally possible conclusions C1, C2,\nC3, \u2026 Cn, admissible within the\nopponent\u2019s system, that follow from thesis T. Then he demonstrates how\nand why each of such conclusions C1, C2,\nC3, \u2026 Cn either leads to an\nundesired consequence (logically problematic or unwelcome within the\nopponent\u2019s system) or contradicts the initial thesis T:\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nT \u2192 C1 \u2227 C2 \u2227 C3\n\u2227 \u2026 \u2227 Cn \n\n(2)\n|C1| = 0\n\n|C2| = 0\n\n|C3| = 0\n\n\u2026\n\n|Cn| = 0 \n\n(3)\n|T| = 0  \n\n\n\nwhere \u20180\u2019 stands not simply for \u2018false\u2019\n(logically), but may also stand for \u2018not admissible within the\nopponent\u2019s specific set of beliefs\u2019, or \u2018not compatible\nwith the opponent\u2019s specific set of beliefs\u2019. To analyse the\ntruth value or admissibility of each of the conclusions C1,\nC2, C3, \u2026 Cn, if their\nstructure is complex, Jayar\u0101\u015bi analyses the conclusions in\ntheir turn using exactly the same method.\n\nWhat may look like a well-known logical law that underlies the\nreductio ad absurdum argument, i.e.,\n\n[(~p\u2192q) \u2227 ~q] \u2192 p,\n\n\nor like other typical laws of the proof by contradiction, i.e.,\n\n\n[(~p\u2192q) \u2227 (~p\u2192~q)] \u2192\np,\n\n[~p \u2192 (q\u2227~q)] \u2192 p, or\n\n[~p \u2192 (q\u2261~q)] \u2192 p ,\n\n\nseems at first closely mirrored by Jayar\u0101\u015bi. However, his\napproach is significantly different in one particular aspect. First,\nJayar\u0101\u015bi analyses positive theses in order to disprove them.\nSecondly, the reductio or the proof by contradiction, whereby p is\nrejected, does not commit one to admitting ~p in the sense of\naccepting a positive state of affairs contrary to p.\nJayar\u0101\u015bi is satisfied merely with a rejection of a thesis,\nwithout postulating his own solution to a problem. In other words,\nwhen Jayar\u0101\u015bi disproves thesis T by demonstrating that its\nconclusions C1, C2, C3, \u2026\nCn are all wrong (either false or doctrinally\ninadmissible), he does not commit himself to the contrary thesis ~T\nwith some kind of ontological entailment. The better way to describe\nhis method would be the following patterns:\n\n\n[(p\u2192q) \u2227 ~q] \u2192 ~p,\n\n[(p\u2192q) \u2227 (p\u2192~q)] \u2192\n~p,\n\n[p \u2192 (q\u2227~q)] \u2192 ~p, or\n\n[p \u2192 (q\u2261~q)] \u2192 ~p ,\n\n\nTo give an example, Jayar\u0101\u015bi first skillfully demonstrates\nthat the universal cannot exist by mentioning three possible\nconclusions: If (T) the universal exists, then (C1) the\nuniversal is different from the individuals in which it is\ninstantiated, (C2) it is not different from the\nindividuals, or (C3) it is different from the individuals\nin some aspects and it is not different from the individuals in other\naspects. Each of these options is then analysed into further options,\nall being eventually shown as wrong or impossible. Since all the three\nconclusions C1, C2 and C3 are\nrejected, the initial thesis T (\u2018the universal exists\u2019) is\nalso rejected. However, he does not say what at all exists, if there\nare no universals.\n\nIn his method, Jayar\u0101\u015bi does not mention all logically\nconceivable conclusions entailed by a thesis he wants to disprove. In\nmost cases, he limits himself just to those implications which are\nrelevant to the discussion with a particular philosophical school, and\nall other logical or thinkable implications of which we know that the\nopponent would never admit for a variety of reason are simply\nignored.\n\nInterestingly, the critical method of analysis of the reductio type\n(prasa\u1e45ga) which Jayar\u0101\u015bi so amply uses is basically\nabsent in the works of the Digambara philosopher Akala\u1e45ka,\nwhereas the method is regularly used by his commentator\nVidy\u0101nanda and all subsequent Jaina thinkers, which may have its\nhistorical relevance and suggest that Jayar\u0101\u015bi was posterior\nto Akala\u1e45ka.\n\nThe reductionist tactics, which Jayar\u0101\u015bi shared with the\nM\u0101dhyamika Buddhists, was traditionally classified by Brahmanic\nphilosophers, e.g. the Naiy\u0101yikas, as an eristical dispute or\nrefutation-only debate (vita\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101) and considered as a\nnon-genuine argument, because the goal of an authentic debate was to\nstrive for truth, understood of course in positive terms. Were such\ncriticisms denying Jayar\u0101\u015bi a genuine argumentative value\njustified? Clearly not, and for a variety of reasons, the most\nimportant being that the main objective of Jayar\u0101\u015bi is\nindicated in the title of his treatise: the dissolution of all\ncategories. How should we understand it? Was his approach purely\nnegative, eristical, nihilistic or agnostic? His main objective, it\nseems, was not necessarily the strong claim that no truths can ever be\nknown. Rather his intention was to show the fundamental dependence of\nour knowledge of reality on cognitive means and categories we accept\nmore or less arbitrarily. The dissolution of all categories implies\nthat the criteria on which all philosophical systems and theories of\nthe world rest are in need of further evidence, which itself is not\npossible without adopting some of these categories or some other\ncategories which again call for further evidence, but which categories\nand methods we chose is ultimately our arbitrary decision. To engage\nin what Brahmanic philosophers would call a \u2018genuine\ndebate\u2019 (v\u0101da) one would necessarily have to accept that\nsuch an arbitrary decision is ultimate and justified, thus giving up\nthe further search for truth, even though the process would be\ninfinite and doomed to terminate untimely. In other words,\ncontradictions and inconsistencies are, in fact, inherently systemic\nin the sense that they are generated by a body of propositions each\nadopted arbitrary for this or other reason, and the systemic knowledge\nultimately lacks reliable and coherent foundations. Just as with\nPyrrhonism in Sextus\u2019 interpretation, Jayar\u0101\u015bi seems to be a\nperpetual investigator: he discards all theories and propositions that\nare neither consistent nor proof-tight, for which there is also no\ncompelling evidence. But it would probably be far-fetched to claim\nthat the idea of truth did not represent any value for him.\n2.2 Scepticism and Definitions\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi may be arguably claimed to represent what has been\nonce labelled epistemological scepticism, or ontological scepticism\n(Hankinson 1995, 13ff), i.e., the position in which one refuses to\naccept the truth of some proposition or to affirm the existence of\nsomething, without denying it, as distinguished from negative\n(ontological) dogmatism, i.e., the attitude in which one actually\nrejects the truth of some proposition and denies the existence of the\nalleged objects. Further, Jayara\u015bi\u2019s qualified methodological\nscepticism should not be confused with what is covered by the term\ne.g. in the case of Descartes\u2019 approach to seek ultimately firm\nfoundations after all beliefs liable to doubt have been successfully\neliminated. Jayar\u0101\u015bi seeks neither ultimate foundations for\nhis system or firm basis for his epistemology, ontology or ethics,\nbecause he never, even vaguely, intimates he would have any. He is\nsatisfied with demonstrating that all we, the philosophers, have so\nfar established, does not hold. But contrary to Descartes\u2019\nmethodological scepticism, Jayar\u0101\u015bi does not really cast\ndoubt on what comes to us from the senses.\n\nAt the outset of his work (TUS 1), he points out the major deficiency\nof our knowledge: \u2018To establish cognitive criteria\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a, instruments of knowledge) depends on proper\ndefinitions. Further, to establish objects of cognitive criteria\ndepends on cognitive criteria. When proper definitions are absent, how\nis it possible that one would treat both the cognitive criteria and\ntheir objects as genuinely real?\u2019 To adopt certain definitions\nwe first have to adopt certain definitions and criteria of validity.\nThat has to be done vis-\u00e0-vis the external reality and tested\nfor validity with respect to phenomena that have all the appearance of\nreal, for Indian philosophers en bloc accepted the correspondence\ntheory of truth. To test the definitions, criteria of validity and\ncognitive criteria with respect to real objects, we should first know\nwhat these real objects really are. To know that we have to have\nreliable instruments of knowledge (cognitive criteria) and criteria of\nvalidity at our disposal. We land in vicious circle: we can neither\nknow cognizable real objects nor determine what genuine cognitive\ncriteria are, nor be actually able to define them without having the\nidea of validity first. Without it we cannot even properly distinguish\nbetween valid cognitive procedures and invalid ones.\n\nSince it is vital to have a proper definition of a cognitive\ncriterion, or a valid cognitive procedure and criterion of truth for\nphilosophical enterprise, Jayar\u0101\u015bi analyses such definitions\nwhich were formulated within most important philosophical schools in\nIndia. The cognitive criteria whose various definitions are one by one\nexamined are perception (pratyak\u1e63a), inference (anum\u0101na),\npresumption (arth\u0101patti), reasoning based on analogy\n(upam\u0101na), negative proof based on absence (abh\u0101va),\nequivalence (sambh\u0101va), tradition (aitihya), and verbal or\nscriptural testimony (\u015babda, \u0101gama). In terms of\nargumentative structure and nature, they all can be reduced to three:\nperception, inference and testimony. The philosophical schools which\nJayar\u0101\u015bi most frequently refers to and criticises their\ndefinitions of the cognitive criteria are the Ny\u0101ya,\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika, S\u0101\u1e41khya, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101\nas well as Buddhist and Jaina schools.\n\nHe demonstrates that no one so far has offered an irrefutable\ndefinition of perception (which does not have to mean that perception\nas such has to be completely unreliable). All definitions of\nperception are seriously flawed and we cannot rely on it in the way it\nis defined: we do not have even a reliable method or a dependable\ncriterion to distinguish a genuine perception from a mirage, optical\nillusion or a mental image (e.g. in hallucination, reminiscence or\ndream). However, Iit is not the case that Jayar\u0101\u015bi argues\nthat \u2018there is simply no way \u2026 to know that our\nsense-perceptions are true\u2019 (King 1999: 19). What he is up to is\nto demonstrate that, given our present definitions of perception and\ncategories on which our epistemology rests, there is no way to\ndetermine which of our sense-perceptions are true.\n\nWhat is considered inference (anum\u0101na) relies on data provided by\nperception which makes inference doubtful. But inference the way it\nhas so far been defined is flawed for a number of other reasons. There\nis no reliable way to relate properties or facts in a truth-conducive\nway. For instance, to infer the cause from the effect one would have\nto first define what causality is, which as Jayar\u0101\u015bi\ndemonstrates cannot be done with the categories we have at our\ndisposal: there is actually no reliable way to relate A and B as cause\nand effect. Further, what do we relate in inference: universals with\nuniversals, universals with a particular, or a particular with a\nparticular? Since universals do not exist, inferences which are based\non such notions are intrinsically flawed. We are left with the idea\nthat inferences depend on particular-to-particular relation. That\nbeing the case, there is no method to establish any kind of valid\nrelationship of universal\u00a0 character between two particulars\nwhich could allow us to draw any sound inferences from\nsingle-instantiated cases. Further, inferences will have to rely on\ncases of inductive reasoning which are logically not valid and cannot\nbe demonstrated to be universally valid. Also testimony of an\nauthority cannot be a legitimate source of knowledge because, first,\nsuch testimony would have to rely on other cognitive criteria and,\nsecond, we would have no means to determine what a reliable testimony\nis or who an authoritative person can be. Therefore, given all\navailable definitions and criteria\u00a0admitted by the tradition,\nnothing can be known for certain (Balcerowicz (2019:\n918\u2013\u00ad924)).\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s undertaking is not restricted to the examination\nof valid cognitive procedures, or cognitive criteria\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) and their definitions. In the course of his work,\nhe analyses a number of fundamental ideas and demonstrates that their\ndefinitions are inadequate and they cannot exist as understood and\ndefined by philosophers. These include such notions as validity and\nnonerroneousness, sublation of previous knowledge by a subsequent\nexperience, universals, the relation of composite wholes to their\nparts, production of cognitions, ontological categories such as\ninherence of properties in their substrata, the nature of illusion,\nthe definition of what exists (e.g. the real object\u2019s ability to\nexecute causally efficient action, artha-kriy\u0101), the nature of\nsense-object contact, memory and recollection, momentariness and\npermanence, conceptuality or conceptual state of mind, relation of the\nconceptual image in cognition to the external thing represented, the\nnature of consciousness (rejection of non-material character), rebirth\nand karmic retribution, causality, visible and invisible objects,\nabsences, rules of inference etc. All these ideas, as\nJayar\u0101\u015bi demonstrates, stand in need of proper definition\nand as long as we do not have them cannot be maintained in their\npresent form.\n\nImportantly, as a recent publication demonstrates, he strictly applies\nfundamental principles of logic, including a range of standard,\nclassical laws of logic, such as: the law of non-contradiction, the\nlaw of excluded middle,\u00a0 the law of identity,\u00a0 De\nMorgan\u2019s laws,\u00a0 Leibniz\u2019s law (the indiscernibility\nof identicals), and other basic axioms of logic, including patterns of\na priori reasoning whose validity is solely determined by their\nlogical form and structure, and not necessarily by their empirical\nrelevance or validation through empirical observation. At least on one\noccasion he also makes use of the fourfold division of logically\npossible alternatives of p, i.e. the tetralemma\n(catu\u1e63-ko\u1e6di) in an argument directed against the Buddhists\n(who themselves accept the tetralemma as a standard procedure):\np, ~p, p\u2227~p, ~(p\u2227~p)\n(Balcerowicz (2019: 924\u2013931). He also takes the conclusions\nderived from premisses through such reasoning based on logic\nprinciples and range of rules (formulated as laws of logic) as valid.\nErgo, he accepts inference \u2013\u00a0but not anum\u0101na \u2013\nas legitimate means of arriving at truth, and these consistently\nremain beyond his criticism. This analysis sheds important light on\nthe nature of his criticism of what was traditionally accepted in\nclassical India as \u2018inference\u2019 (anum\u0101na), which is\ndeficient for two main reasons: its definitions formulated by\nphilosophers are faulty, and its validity is rooted in empirical\nconditions. Indian anum\u0101na is just a sub-theory of logic and\nshould be understood as inference in a qualified sense and of a\nnarrower scope, applied to empirically relevant claims, based on\nempirically observed regularities and advancing arguments involving\nthe problem of induction; anum\u0101na completely excludes deduction\nand all varieties of a priori reasoning and analytic judgements. What\nis termed anum\u0101na should therefore be called \u2018disputational\ninference\u2019 or \u2018debational inference\u2019, in view of its\norigins in the context of debate. We can observe that\nJayar\u0101\u015bi\u2019s case does not present that of a genuine\nsceptic who would put to doubt the possibility of arriving at truth\nper se and would point to fundamental impossibility to know facts. His\napproach is not scepticism, which questions the epistemic principles\nhe himself also employs. Instead, with the logical apparatus that\nrests in one domain the validity of which he takes for granted,\nJayar\u0101\u015bi finds fault with another, quite different domain:\nthat of the principles of traditional Indian epistemological and\nlogical model, rooted in reasonings which are based on empirical\nobservation and are not a priori (Balcerowicz (2019:\n931\u2013943).\n2.3 Positive Views\n\nJayar\u0101\u015bi, as we noted, is cautious not to affirmatively\nstate anything, and nowhere does he use such expressions as\n\u2018thus it was established that\u2019 (iti sthitam) or similar\nexpressions typical of all other philosophical works. Despite this,\ncan we reconstruct any positive views he affirms or is his scepticism\nall-embracing? It seems there a few such views. His clear rejection of\nkarmic retribution, afterlife and the supernatural (\u2018human\nactions do no bring otherworldly results, such as rebirth in heaven\netc.\u2019) and the claim the ultimate reality for us is what we\nexperience and what surrounds us concerns both metaphysics and ethics.\nMetaphysically, there is no supernatural reality of any relevance to\nus. Ethically, the only criterion to determine what is right and wrong\nis what people agree to accept as such (\u2018the worldly path should\nbe followed\u2019). Quite frequently, he uses examples of\nnon-existent entities such as demons (pi\u015b\u0101ca), atoms\n(param\u00e2\u1e47u) and god (mah\u00ea\u015bvara), taking their\nfictitious character for granted, which indicates that he apparently\nrejected invisible reality which is intrinsically beyond our\nsenses.\n\nA recent publication enumerates altogether more than a dozen such\npositive views that can be possibly reconstructed and ascribed to\nJayar\u0101\u015bi (Balcerowicz (2020: 599\u2013600)). On one\noccasion (in the Buddhist section, TUP, p.57\u201388 = Franco (1987:\n269\u2013271) = Solomon (2010: 120) = Jha (2013: 228\u2013229)),\nwhile refuting the view that \u2018the first moment of consciousness\n[of the newly born], immediately after the exit from the mother\u2019s\nwomb, is preceded by another moment of consciousness\u2019, he\nconcludes that \u2018the first moment of consciousness in the womb\netc. [i.e., of the newly born], must come from the combination of the\nelements\u2019, which is a typically materialist view. He further\ntakes consciousness to be a product of matter; rejects the existence\nof the soul or any kind of conscious entity that might exist\nindependently of the material body, and all that is supernatural and\nimperceptible, such as demons (pi\u015baca), atoms\n(param\u00e2\u1e47u) or god (mah\u00ea\u015bvara); dismisses\nafterlife, transmigration, karmic retribution (karman), virtue\n(pu\u1e47ya) or vice (p\u0101pa); denies heavens, hells, liberation,\nomniscient beings and omniscience; rejects ritualism and and the\npurposefulness of religious cult, religious revelation, religious\nauthority (\u0101pta), the concept of righteousness (dharma);\ndismisses the validity of the pram\u0101\u1e47a model of\nepistemology, but accepts the validity of direct experience\n(anubhava).\n\nHe plainly states that \u2018universals do not exist\u2019 (TUP, 4.5\nff.), which does not seem to be a mere thesis which he rejects just\nfor the sake of argument, because throughout his work he will refer to\nthis claim (\u2018we have already shown that universals do not\nexist\u2019). He is a nominalist in accepting only particulars which\nfor him are external, macroscopic, non-momentary and material objects.\nOn another occasion (TUS 24) he criticises the view that composite\nmacroscopic wholes cannot exist, and what exists instead are their\nparts only (a typical Buddhist nominalist position). He concludes\nthere is no way to demonstrate that composite wholes are non-existent.\nInterestingly, he nowhere links the idea of composite wholes (and the\nparadox of the whole and its parts), which he seems to accept, to idea\nthe universal (and the paradox of the universal and the particulars as\nits instantiations), which he clearly rejects. These two concepts, the\nwholes and universals, were generally analysed in India jointly as two\naspects of the same problem: just as the whole exists (or does not\nexist) through its parts, in the very same way also the universal\nexists (or does not exist) through its particulars. Interestingly,\nJayar\u0101\u015bi never links these two issues, precisely because, it\nseems, he admitted the existence of macroscopic objects of our\nexperience (i.e., composite wholes) whereas he rejected the existence\nof universals. Being a sceptic, he does seem to accept a\n\u2018commonsensical view\u2019 of the world that consists of such\nmacroscopic objects, but not of invisible atoms or universals, demons\nand god. In line with this approach, he seemed also to maintain that\nconsciousness is a product or combination of the four elements (see\nabove). It should not come as a surprise to discover that all these\nviews he shared with genuine materialists of the C\u0101rv\u0101ka /\nLok\u0101yata tradition.\n\nWhat may appear as a truly sceptical thesis is his assumption that all\nphilosophical claims are always made within a particular set of\nbeliefs, i.e., within a particular system which is based on\narbitrarily accepted criteria, definitions and categories. His\npragmatic, \u2018commonsensical attitude\u2019 is highlighted in a\nverse he quotes: \u2018with respect to everyday practice of the\nworld, the fool and the wise are similar\u2019 (see above), because\nultimately we all have to rely on our experience and defective and\npartial knowledge of reality.\n\nThe conclusion of his work: \u2018Thus, when all categories are\ncompletely dissolved in the above manner, all practical actions (which\nentails thought, speech and activity) can be enjoyable, without being\nreflected upon\u2019, is quite meaningful. On the one hand it could\nbe taken to imply some kind of a carpe diem attitude: given our\nlimitations and intrinsic inability to know with certainty, the only\noption we are left with is to enjoy the world the way it appears to\nus. On the other hand, the statement could also suggest that what\nJayar\u0101\u015bi had in mind was that for all our practical\nactivities, including thinking, verbal communication, behaviour or\nordinary life, the world of our actions \u2014 as long as it is\nrelevant to us \u2014 is \u2018here and now\u2019 and retains its\nultimate validity, even though we are incapable of its proper\nphilosophical analysis.\n",
