    "main_text": "\n\n\nHistorically, few of the philosophers who defended justice in the\npublic political realm argued for just family structures. Instead, most\nviewed the family as a separate realm that needed to be protected from\nstate intrusion. The private sphere and the public sphere were\ndichotomized into separate realms with the latter beyond the reach\nof public action. Where these philosophers did not legitimate private\npower in the family, they simply ignored it.\n\n\nJohn Stuart Mill was a notable exception, arguing in The\nSubjection of Women, that the inequality of women in the\nfamily was incompatible with their equality in the wider social world.\nConsider, he asks, the consequences of \u201cthe self-worship, the\nunjust self preference\u201d nourished in boys growing up in male\ndominated households in which \u201cby the mere fact of being born\nmale he is by right the superior of all and every one of an entire\nhalf of the human race\u201d (1869, 86\u201387). How will such\nboys grow up into men who treat women as equals? Feminist scholarship\nhas continued, extended and deepened this attack on the conception of\nthe family as a private personal realm. Indeed, the idea that\n\u201cthe personal [that is, the family] is political\u201d is the\ncore idea of most contemporary feminism.\n",
