In addition to his importance as a\nmoral philosopher Butler was also an influential Anglican theologian.\nUnsurprisingly his theology and philosophy were connected \u2014 his\nmain writings in moral philosophy were published sermons, a work of\nnatural theology, and a brief dissertation attached to that work.\nAlthough most of Butler\u2019s moral arguments make rich use of\npassages from scripture and familiar Christian stories and concepts,\nthey make little reference to \u2014 and depend little on the reader\nhaving \u2014 any particular religious commitments. Indeed many of\nhis arguments do not rest on the reader having any religious\ncommitments at all. His Analogy of Religion was aimed to\nconvince deists of the truth of core doctrines of natural and revealed\ntheology but the argument only assumes the premises Butler shared with\nthem. This has led to his philosophy being of interest to both secular\nand Christian moralists, and to debate as to how much and what of his\nethics rests on his Christian commitments.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life, Works, and General Overview\n\nButler was born in 1692 and attended a dissenting academy where he\nread current philosophy \u2014 including up to date logic, and works\nof John Locke and Samuel Clarke. While a student there Butler wrote a\nletter to Clarke pointing out two problems in Clarke\u2019s arguments\nfor God\u2019s unicity and God\u2019s omnipresence in Demonstration\nof the Being and Attributes of God. Butler\u2019s criticisms led to a\nmutually admiring correspondence. Clarke arranged to have the\ncorrespondence published in 1716, although Butler\u2019s letters\nappeared anonymously. Shortly thereafter Butler joined the Church of\nEngland, attended Oxford, and was ordained. This led to his\nappointment as preacher at Rolls Chapel, the chapel associated with\nthe London equity courts, where he served until 1726. During this\nperiod he also earned a law degree. In 1726 he published a selection\nof his sermons as Fifteen Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel. It\nappeared in a second edition in 1729 with corrections and with the\naddition of an important synoptic \u201cPreface.\u201d In 1736\nButler published his major work of natural theology, the Analogy\nof Religion, the work for which he was best known in his\nlifetime, with two brief but important dissertations: \u201cOf\nPersonal Identity\u201d and \u201cOf the Nature of Virtue\u201d\n(hence \u201cDissertation on Virtue\u201d). In the same year he was\nappointed Queen Caroline\u2019s cleric, and after her death the\nfollowing year he rose to become Bishop of Bristol (1738) and\neventually Bishop of Durham (1750). A number of his sermons from the\nlatter part of his career were published individually. Some of them\nwere collected as Six Sermons on Public Occasions and published in\n1749. This was followed by the \u201cDurham Charge\u201d (a work\nexhorting the clergy of his diocese) published a year before\nButler\u2019s death in 1752 (For more on Butler\u2019s life see\nCunliffe 2008, from which most of the above information is derived;\nsee also Cunliffe 1992 and Tennant 2011).\n\nButler\u2019s moral philosophy is characterized by a very high degree\nof analytic rigor and argumentative care. This is all the more\nsurprising for the fact that many of these rigorous arguments are\npresented in sermons (and particularly in footnotes to sermons). The\nmanner in which Butler argues, and the details of the particular\narguments, are indeed what many philosophers who have engaged with him\nhave found most inspiring, even when they have rejected his\nconclusions whole-heartedly. Butler\u2019s first three sermons\nprovide a general framework for his moral philosophy via a\nteleological account of human nature. On the basis of this account of\nhuman nature Butler argues that self-love and benevolence or virtue --\nprinciples that other moral philosophers have seen as in tension\n\u2014 are not only not in tension but mutually supporting when\nproperly understood. The remaining sermons consider a number of key\nfeatures of moral psychology \u2014 self-deception, benevolence,\nforgiveness, compassion \u2014 and further develop the discussions of\nself-love and virtue initiated in the first three sermons. They make\nmanifest that Butler thought that the details of moral psychology when\ncarefully presented and rigorously sorted ruled out many questionable\ncommitments that looser philosophers took them to warrant. These\nparticular moral psychological inquiries are followed by a discussion\nof love of God. For Butler this was a central and unifying sentiment\nthat showed the continuity between morals and natural religion. Butler\nconcluded the Sermons with a discussion of human ignorance, which in\nconjunction with his discussions of self-deceit underscored one of his\ncentral themes: the limits of human self-knowledge and knowledge of\ndivine design, limits that had to be continuously in mind when making\nmoral arguments. Butler\u2019s later sermons, the \u201cDissertation\non Virtue,\u201d and the sections of the Analogy of Religion\nthat concern moral philosophy, also continue to develop many of these\nthemes.\n2. Moral Science\n\nIn his \u201cPreface\u201d to the 2nd edition of his Sermons Butler\nsketched his vision of \u201cMorals, considered as a Science,\u201d\n(\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a76) \u2014 i.e. speculative moral\nphilosophy in need of defense from speculative objections as opposed\nto practical moral counsel or revealed religion. Morals considered as\na science proceeds either from abstract relations of things or from\nmatters of fact (\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a712). Clarke and William\nWollaston were influential philosophers who argued primarily from\nabstract relations to moral obligations, duties, virtues, etc. in\ntheir moral systems. Clarke in particular had argued that we have a\npriori access to the eternal \u201cfitnesses\u201d of things through\ncertain, abstract, and necessary quasi-mathematical arguments (Clarke\n1706) that entail necessary moral obligations and duties insofar as\nactions accord with or fail to accord with eternal and immutable\nrealities. In his correspondence with Clarke, the young Butler noted\nhis discovery of a new method for establishing truths in morals\n(Butler/Clarke 1716, \u00a71). Although the correspondence took place\na few years before Butler delivered the Sermons, it seems likely that\nthe method he alluded to in the correspondence was the nascent method\nthat he would deploy in the first three sermons (which Butler stressed\nwere argued strictly from matters of fact) (\u201cPreface\u201d\n\u00a713).\n\nButler had little doubt that arguments from abstract relations and\narguments from matters of fact were complementary, but he held that\nthe latter had major advantages over the former as a method in ethics.\nFirst it was in \u201ca peculiar Manner adapted to satisfie a fair\nMind; and is more easily applicable to the several particular\nRelations and Circumstances in Life\u201d (\u201cPreface,\u201d\n\u00a712). In other words, arguments from matters of fact allowed us\nto discern moral standards in human actions and for the standards to\nbe accessible to and motivating for ordinary reflecting agents (to be\ndiscussed in 3.). Whereas the abstract relations of things might\nestablish for Clarke or Wollaston that \u201cVice is contrary to the\nNature and Reasons of Things\u201d (\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a712),\narguments of matter of fact established that vice is \u201ca\nviolation or breaking in upon our own Nature,\u201d\n(\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a712). These fitnesses or proportions were\nto be discovered in our nature and although they might be consistent\nwith a priori metaphysical relations, the norms and values that they\ndetermined were obliging and motivating in absence of access to said\nrelations. As such they were relativized to human nature,\nauthoritative for it, and accessible via reflection on and observation\nof our actions and those of others\n\nBut one might still worry that moral judgments that rested on probable\nmatters of fact were less secure than those found to be in accordance\nwith eternal fitnesses, even with the aforementioned advantages. Seven\nyears later, Butler offered a methodological argument in the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to the Analogy that might respond\nto this objection if applied to morals (although Butler framed the\npoint more generally). Although deductive arguments like those\nchampioned by Clarke were secure when considered abstractly, they were\nopen to doubt when applied to matters of fact about actions or\ncharacters. This was because one needed a hypothesis of how to apply\nthe abstract demonstrative truths to observed facts\n(\u201cIntroduction\u201d \u00a77) \u2014 how to fit the fitnesses\nto actions so to speak \u2014 and this hypothesis itself was not\ndeductively secure. Butler offered the analogy of Cartesian\nphysiology. Cartesian physiology applies Cartesian geometry to living\nbodies. But one needs a probable hypothesis to move from the abstract\ntruths of Cartesian geometry to actual bodies and diseases. For\nexample, \u201cthis spleen is roughly an oval and the way it\ninteracts with the liver roughly results in this sort of\nmechanism.\u201d The mechanism itself as represented abstractly is a\ncertain geometrical relationship. But in order to apply the mechanism\nto blood and guts, one needs to have a probable, i.e. not certain,\nhypothesis about how the ideal mechanism fits with the facts on the\nground \u2014 that this arrangement of blood and guts is best\ncaptured by this mechanism not that one. A similar problem arises when\napplying eternal and abstract relations to particular moral\ncircumstances and actions. The need for a hypothesis as to how the\nrelations might fit actual actions rendered the evaluation of the\naction merely probable even though the rightness and wrongness to\nwhich the action was to conform \u2014 the eternal fitness \u2014\nwas known certainly.\n\nSince both Clarke\u2019s method and Butler\u2019s method were\nprobable, Clarke\u2019s probable in application to actions and\nButler\u2019s in relying on matters of fact about human nature in\nestablishing facts about vice and virtue, one might conclude\nskeptically that both failed. But Butler argued that a probable course\nof action could still be morally obligatory. He claimed that probable\nreasoning could result in sufficient certainty for moral action when\nan action could be shown to be more probably good than either inaction\nor an opposed action. Lacking further evidence the more probably good\naction is morally obligatory. This suggested a way in which probable\nevidence, for example probable evidence for the existence of an\nafterlife, could be obliging on us and was crucial to his arguments\nfor the reasonableness of basic Christian teachings in the\nAnalogy.\n3. Human Nature\n\nBecause of the absence of a priori demonstrative premises, a moral\nphilosopher arguing from matters of fact had to have detailed\nknowledge of the principles of action in human nature and of moral\npsychology as well as arguments to show how these principles had\nbearing on virtue and vice. Human beings, according to Butler, had\nwithin their nature various instincts and principles of action:\ndesires for particular pleasures, benevolence, self-love, and\nconscience. The practitioner of moral science aimed to discover what\nthese principles are and the ways in which these desires, reasons, and\nmotivations fit together. This is difficult in practice since the\nactions that we observe in ourselves and in others almost always draw\non more than one principle. For example both self-love and the\nparticular passions often go into the motivation or justification for\nparticular actions. Consequently the moral scientist could be said to\nbring a version of Locke\u2019s negative program of underbrush\nclearing in the theory of knowledge to moral philosophy, by analyzing\nand disambiguating principles, motivations, and passions which give\nrise to actions which we judge to be virtuous and vicious. At the same\ntime Butler\u2019s way of thinking about morality as dictated by\nnature had strong resonances with the Stoics and other ancient\nmoralists.\n\nIn order to show how these principles, motivations, and passions bear\non virtue and vice Butler distinguished between three senses of\n\u201cnature\u201d (Sermon 2). Nature (N1) can refer to any\nprinciple or element that belongs to or motivates human beings. It can\nalso refer (N2) to the strongest among a group of principles, i.e., it\nis in our nature to get angry, not to giggle, when unjustly accused.\nFinally it can refer (N3) to natural supremacy, i.e., that a principle\nacts as a law, guide, or authority to other principles or passions.\nButler suggests that whatever is naturally supreme unites various\nprinciples in a teleological system. Consequently Butler can be seen\nto be arguing that when we take a survey of all that belongs to human\nnature (N1) we discover that conscience has natural supremacy (N3) in\na united hierarchy (although see Section Five for Butler\u2019s claim\nthat self-love is also a supreme principle). N1 principles can be\nidentified piecemeal, particular passions that belong to the human\nframe. N2 principles are relational, i.e. the strongest of a group of\nprinciples. N3 principles are relational as well but they are also\nrational and they unify other sorts of principles. By educing a\nhierarchy in the principles of human nature, and by showing that the\nhierarchy is independent of the strength (N2) of the principles as\nmotivations for action, we can demonstrate that what we ought to do\nmorally (N3) may differ from what we are most strongly motivated to do\n(N2) without reflection.\n\nButler\u2019s best-known arguments for the natural hierarchy of\nprinciples draw on a number of analogies: to a watch\n(\u201cPreface\u201d), to a civil constitution (Sermon III), to a\ntree, and to a machine (Sermon 3 Note 1). Just as a clock is not an\nindividual gear, or a pile of gears, but is what it is due to the ways\nin which the gears move together towards an end, so too human nature\nis not a particular principle of action, or a bundle of principles,\nbut the interaction of principles, desires, and reasons, as a system\ntowards ends. That our nature is structured towards ends, which Butler\ntakes to be empirically evident, gives evidence of a hierarchy of\nprinciples to attain the ends, a hierarchy where some principles must\nbe naturally subordinate to others (N3). This shows that there is\nsomething natural to us in the sense of N3, in addition to N1 and N2\n(both of which are a matter of observed fact). \u201cA civil\nconstitution implies in it united strength, various subordinates under\none direction \u2026 a superior faculty whose office it is to\nadjust, manage, and preside over them\u201d (Sermon III \u00a72). The\ngoverning faculty has authority. When a civil constitution is violated\nor overthrown by \u201cmeer power\u201d this goes against the nature\nof the constitution. When a machine\u2019s or a tree\u2019s parts no\nlonger bear proportionate relations among themselves and are no longer\nguided by superior principles, it is broken or sick. By analogy, when\nforceful principles and passions (N2) go against authoritative\nprinciples (N3), or when the principles and passions no longer bear\nthe same relations or are in conflict this goes against our nature and\nis unnatural.\n\nThe analogy suggests that it is unnatural when a N2 principle\noverpowers a N3 principle. The subordination of N2 principles to N3\nprinciples is natural and preserves and guides our natures. N3\nprinciples are what we ought to act on or act in accordance with.\nDeciding whether Butler holds that we ought to act on them just\nbecause they are in accordance with our nature or we ought to act on\nthem because they are morally right and in accordance with our nature\nhas led to some of the most salient objections to Butler\u2019s moral\nphilosophy (see Section 4).\n\nThe supremacy of conscience in human nature can also be shown by a\ncomparison of the constitutions and natures of animals with human\nnature. Animals are driven by principles similar to (or identical to)\nthose that give rise to human actions: they share many of our passions\nand they too are driven by self-interest. When animals act according\nto these principles they act appropriately to their natures (in senses\nN1 and N2). But humans have a principle, conscience, which animals\nlack. This suggests that when humans act only from those principles\nthat they share with animals and not according to conscience they do\nnot act suitably to what is distinctive to their whole nature, and in\nparticular suitable to that end which draws on many of the principles\nof human nature .\n\nInterpreters of Butler have disagreed about the degree to which\nButler\u2019s teleological and hierarchical account of human nature\nrelies on theological premises, and on what sort of teleology is at\nplay. Some interpreters hold that Butler\u2019s arguments that there\nare N3 principles only go through if we assume that God created human\nbeings for a purpose and in accordance with providence (Darwall 1995;\nPenelhum 1985). On this account what human beings ought to be or ought\nto do follows from what they were designed for. Humans were designed\nfor virtue and so they ought to be virtuous. Others suggest that the\nargument has support without recourse to theological arguments, and\nthat the teleological facts about human nature imply norms and values\nthat are obliging without reference to design (Wedgwood 2007; Irwin\n2008).\n4. Conscience and the principles of human nature\n\nLike Shaftesbury, Butler held that conscience is a reflective\nprinciple. Shaftesbury asserted that \u201cevery reasoning or\nreflecting Creature is, by his Nature, forc\u2019d to endure the\nReview of his own Mind, and Actions; and to have Representations of\nhimself, and his inward Affairs, constantly passing before him,\nobvious to him, and revolving in his Mind\u201d (Shaftesbury 1699\nII.1 [119]). For Butler conscience is more specifically a reflection\non prospective or retrospective actions of oneself and others\naccording to moral principles. When we judge characters we reflect on\nactions in relation to the capacities of agents (\u201cDissertation\non Virtue\u201d \u00a75). Butler presumes that all ordinary human\nbeings have a sense of right and wrong in presuming that the moral\nprinciples are accessible for reflection, and that the many ways of\ndescribing this sense of right and wrong all point to one and the same\ncapacity: \u201cConscience, moral Reason, moral sense, or divine\nReason\u2026 as a Sentiment of the Understanding, or as a Perception\nof the Heart\u201d (\u201cDissertation on Virtue\u201d \u00a71).\nThere are a number of elements in the natural supremacy of conscience\nthat help us to understand the nature of its authority.\n\nFirst, according to Butler conscience has a unique authority among the\nprinciples belonging to human nature. As evidenced in the civil\nconstitution analogy, we recognize that it should direct other\nprinciples and not vice-versa and that the authority is proper to\nconscience and no other principle. Further we recognize that any\nordinary reasonable person has a conscience and ought to obey it. The\nterm \u201cconscience\u201d was commonly employed in both\ntheological and philosophical contexts (Shaftesbury identified it with\nreflective reason) but was also a legal term of art among the equity\nlawyers to whom Butler preached his sermons. In the legal context it\nhad the sense of acting minimally as an ordinary reasonable person\nwould and maximally as a fully informed, ideal reasoner would (see\nGarrett 2012).\n\nNext, conscience is closely connected to autonomy: when we act\naccording to conscience we act as a law unto ourselves or according to\na law of our own nature. By being a law unto oneself Butler seemed to\nmean being motivated by our inner sense of moral rightness and\nwrongness and not being motivated by considerations external to the\nrightness or wrongness of acting or not acting (Sermon III \u00a76).\nFor Butler, like Clarke, moral law, duty, obligation, or virtue, is\nright or wrong, morally good or bad independent of any punishment or\nreward (\u201cPreface\u201d \u00a7 29; \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue\u201d \u00a78). Butler criticized those forms of natural law\nand Hobbesian accounts of motivation that held that I am morally\nmotivated and given an authoritative reason for acting by a law\nsanctioned with rewards and punishments by a divine or civil\nlegislator. He argued that insofar as sanctions are superadded to the\nmoral rightness or wrongness of the act there is no connection between\nthe sanction and the rightness or wrongness of the action beyond the\narbitrary will of the legislator. This connection is insufficient for\nmoral motivation. When I act primarily or only due to an external\nsanction I am not acting from a law unto myself (see Darwall\n1992).\n\nThis law of conscience is readily accessible to us \u2014 \u201cthe\nmost near and intimate, the most certain and known\u201d\n(\u201cPreface,\u201d \u00a7 26) \u2014 in a way that probable\nconsequences of prudential or interested actions are not. That an\nauthoritative principle dictates that we ought to intend a good action\ndoes not depend on external factors that might prevent or mitigate the\ndesired prudential outcome (but see McNaughton 2012). Relatedly, ends\nmay vary but conscience is \u201cfixed, steady, and\nimmovable.\u201d\n\nButler argued in the Sermons that conscience was a principle superior\nto and governing of the particular passions, affections, and instincts\nand established a hierarchy among them (Sermon XIII \u00a77). As\npreviously discussed the hierarchy is natural. But due to ambiguities\nin Butler\u2019s presentation, in particular due to differences in\nthe aims of individual sermons, there are a number of ways to\nunderstand the relation between conscience and the other principles.\nOn one reading conscience is authoritative over the other main\nprinciples discussed by Butler \u2014 self-love and benevolence (if\nit is a principle \u2014 see Section 5) \u2014 and all when properly\nunderstood promote the same actions in accordance with our nature.\nWhen we seek our own goods and those of others in accordance with\nconscience or reflection we act virtuously and we also promote our\nprivate happiness. But, there are also passages that suggest that\nButler held self-love to be a principle on par with conscience\n(Sidgwick III.12 \u00a72) or even above it (Sermon IX \u00a715). And\nthere are passages where Butler suggests that benevolence contains all\nthe virtues, and consequently this too seems to be a principle on par\nwith or identical with conscience. Consequently there are multiple\nplausible hierarchies. Interpreters who advocate hierarchies which\nplace self-love or benevolence on par with (or even above) conscience\nnormally either argue that they are still consistent with the\nsupremacy of conscience or see this as showing a serious problem in\nButler\u2019s arguments.\n\nHere are few of the problems. If it is reasonable to obey conscience,\nthen \u201cthe rules that Conscience lays down\u201d are either\nreasonable in and of themselves or they are \u201cthe dictates of an\narbitrary authority\u201d (Sidgwick, III.13 \u00a72). If the latter,\nthen it is hard to see what justifies this arbitrary authority. But if\nthe former, then Sidgwick argues that there is no independent moral\nauthority for conscience \u2014 a conclusion which Sidgwick thought\nperfectly reasonable \u2014 and Butler is caught in the same\njustificatory circle that the Stoic arguments for life according to\nnature were: \u201cit is reasonable to live according to Nature, and\nit is natural to live according to Reason\u201d (ibid.). A related\nobjection is that since both conscience and self-love are rational\nprinciples and in general cannot be in conflict, conscience just\ndictates whatever self-love dictates and vice-versa. Consequently\nconscience cannot have a distinctive authority. Sturgeon identified a\ndifferent circularity connected with the justification of the\nsupremacy of conscience. Since Butler held that virtuous actions are\nthose in conformity to the nature of the agent and vicious ones not in\nconformity, according to Sturgeon \u201cthe doctrine of natural\nauthority of conscience is entirely superfluous\u201d (Sturgeon,\n316). This is because if conscience points to the wrongness of an\naction the wrongness must be due to the action\u2019s conformity or\nnon-conformity with our nature \u2014 i.e. due to a conflict among\nprinciples. Conscience can\u2019t be pointing to a conflict with\nitself since that would be circular. So it must be a conflict with the\nnext highest principle: self-interest. But then conscience just\nasserts what self-interest dictates, and so the testimony of\nconscience is redundant and has no special authority. Put differently,\nButler assumes that his argument that virtue is natural entails an\nargument for the supremacy of conscience. But there is no good reason\nto assume the entailment \u2014 in fact the two are not only\nindependent, but in conflict. There have been a number of responses to\nSturgeon. Penelhum, notably, denied that Butler was committed to the\n\u201cFull Naturalistic Thesis\u201d and argued that Butler instead\nheld \u201cthe independent existence of the judgments of right and\nwrong\u201d from judgments of \u201cnaturalness and\nunnaturalness\u201d (Penelhum 1990, 68; see also Irwin 2008 \u00a7707\nand McNaughton 2012).\n5. Self-Love and Benevolence\n\nAs previously noted, Butler discusses two other important constituents\nof human nature in addition to conscience and the particular passions:\nself-love and benevolence. Butler\u2019s extremely influential\ndismissal of psychological egoism was central to his analysis of\nself-love. C. D. Broad claimed that \u201che killed the theory so\nthoroughly that he sometimes seems to the modern reader to be flogging\ndead horses\u201d (Broad 1930, 55). For Butler the kind of egoism\nexemplified by Hobbes \u2014 \u201cthe selfish theory\u201d in\neighteenth-century parlance \u2014 rests on a failure to distinguish\nprinciples from passions (for context see Maurer 2019). There is a\ntrivial sense in which all of our passions are our own and the\npleasure we have in discharging or pursuing any passion is\n\u201cself\u201d love. But it is also uninteresting: we can\u2019t\nconclude much from the fact that every passion we take pleasure in is\nour passion. We certainly can\u2019t conclude that human beings are\nalways motivated by selfishness. That selfish theorists thought we\ncould was due in part to their confusing the \u201cownership of an\nimpulse with its object\u201d (Broad 1930, 65)\u2014the inference\nfrom that the passions are ours to that we are the objects of the\npassions. Although the passions belong to us it does not therefore\nfollow that our \u201cself,\u201d or our self-gratification, is the\nobject of the passion.\n\nOne of the most discussed passages from the Sermons, the so-called\n\u201cstone argument\u201d (Sober 1992) has often been taken as an\nargument against psychological hedonism. In the passage Butler\npurports to establish that \u201call particular appetites and\npassions are towards external things themselves, distinct from the\npleasure arising from them\u201d due to the fact \u201cthat there\ncould not be this pleasure, were it not for that prior suitableness\nbetween the object and the passion\u201d (Sermon XI \u00a76). Butler\nthen concludes were this not the case then \u201cthere could be no\nenjoyment or delight from one thing more than another, from eating\nfood more than from swallowing a stone, if there were not an affection\nor appetite to one thing more than another\u201d (Sermon XI \u00a76).\nThe upshot of the stone argument seems to be that appetites and\npassions must have something more than, or other than, pleasure as\ntheir object. That said not everyone has seen Butler\u2019s argument\nas valid (Penelhum 1985; Henson 1988; Sober 1992; Tilley 2018) and\nthere is disagreement on what exactly it is an argument against.\n\nThese mistakes are connected to another: confusing the principle of\nself-love, which has the happiness of the self as its object, with\nparticular passions and desires. Once we recognize that \u201cthe\npain of hunger and shame, and the delight from esteem, are no more\nself-love than they are any thing in the world\u201d (Sermon I, Note\n3) \u2014 they are particular passions and desires with particular\nobjects \u2014 we see that from the fact that we take pleasure in our\npassions and that they are our passions it does not follow that we are\nguided by selfish principles. Passions do make us happy or unhappy.\nBut that we have an interest in being happy or unhappy is distinct\nfrom the particular passions, their objects, or the happiness arising\nfrom the passions \u2014 although it may be a reason to prefer one\npassion over another. This was connected to Butler\u2019s belief that\npassions are not interested in themselves. They have particular ends\nwhereas self-love is our general interest in securing our\nhappiness.\n\nLike Shaftesbury and Francis Hutcheson, Butler thought it prima facie\nevident that human beings had benevolent motivations, and he thought\nit obvious that these benevolent motivations could make us happy and\nbe consistent with self-interest. The onus was on advocates of the\nselfish theory to provide a compelling case against. Butler placed\nmore stress on the exceptions than Shaftesbury had and stressed that\nthey are \u201cnaturally\u201d consistent, i.e. that they are\nconsistent in our nature and the natural course of things although the\nunnatural and intemperate actions of others might interfere locally\n(Analogy III \u00a75; \u00a727). He saw Hobbes\u2019\nreduction of all other-directed motivations -- such as compassion --\nto selfish motivations in disguise to deny an evident matter of fact\nfor theoretical reasons, i.e. in order to reconcile benevolence and\ncompassion with Hobbes\u2019 general hypothesis about human nature.\nBut once a compassionate motivation is recast as a selfish motivation,\nfor Hobbes as a type of fear, it conflicts with the sense of the term\nbeing explained to the point that it engenders contradiction. For\nexample: we feel compassion strongly towards our friends. If\ncompassion were a fear then we would fear our friends strongly, which\nseems to conflict with the agreed use of the word\n\u201ccompassion.\u201d\n\nWhich was not to deny of course that people act from selfishness,\nself-partiality, and confused self-interest. Selfishness and\nself-partiality often mix with benevolent motivations to give rise to\nbenevolent and even compassionate actions (Sermon V Note 1). Unlike\nShaftesbury and Hutcheson, Butler stressed that human beings often act\nfrom mixed and opaque motives (as will be discussed in Section 6). But\nthe existence of mixed motivations presumes non-interested motivations\nwith which selfishness is mixed, not the reducibility of all\nmotivations to selfishness or self-partiality. This also has the\nvirtue of being a simpler explanation than the more complicated\nselfish motivations offered by Hobbes\u2019 theory.\n\nAccording to Butler, once clarified self-love is properly understood\nas \u201cregard to our own Interest, Happiness, and private\nGood\u201d (Sermon IX \u00a78). Butler further suggests that\nself-love can be pursued better and worse, and that it is best\nreflected on via reason in a cool and impartial way. By\n\u201ccool\u201d Butler understood \u201cimpartial\u201d in the\nsense of not being swayed away from the truth by particular loves and\nhates or by self-partiality. And by \u201creason\u201d Butler\nunderstood the faculty of discerning truth (Sermon XIII \u00a75).\nSelf-love worked best and our interest was best served when we\nimpartially seek what is truly in our interest. When understood in\nthis way it can clearly suggest actions that conflict with\nselfishness. Conversely resolute selfishness and self-partiality are\nnot the best course for self-love. To satisfy a particular desire may\nor may not make us happy in either the short or long-term and may not\neduce to our private good. And although satisfying a desire may make\nus happy, and all of our happiness may be the result of particular\npassions, no particular passion has happiness in general as its\nobject.\n\nConversely we might fruitlessly seek our interest but have no\nparticular object in mind. Or we might obsess over our interest to\nsuch a degree that we would continually be exercising the principle of\nself-love but not actually satisfying our particular passions and\nconsequently not be happy. \u201cHappiness consists in the\nGratification of certain Affections, Appetites, Passions, with Objects\nwhich are by Nature adapted to them,\u201d (Sermon IX \u00a716).\nSelf-love is a principle governing actions leading to the satisfaction\nor avoidance of the particular passions. Both self-love and the\nparticular passions are necessary for the proper natural functioning\nof human beings.\n\nOnce self-love is distinguished from selfishness, self-partiality and\nthe particular passions it becomes clearer that the conflict between\nself-love and benevolence is mostly an illusion when considered in the\nlong term. Particular passions like compassion are perfectly\nconsistent with self-love, indeed Butler held that to take pleasure in\nbenevolent and virtuous acts and view them as part of one\u2019s\nhappiness is \u201citself the Temper of Satisfaction and\nEnjoyment.\u201d In the Analogy, Butler provided further\narguments that the natural tendency of virtue was the reward of\nhappiness, and the natural punishment for vice, misery. We often fail\nto see this natural tendency because we focus on accidents or a\nlimited range of examples to the detriment of the consistent long-term\ntendencies. Butler suggested a thought experiment of a monarchy run on\nvirtuous principles (Analogy III \u00a720) and argued that it\nwould tend to be happier and more powerful than other regimes if\nallowed to flourish, eventually becoming a universal monarchy. The\nnatural tendency of happiness, power, and virtue all coincide in its\nflourishing, growth, and moral governance. And happiness as coupled to\nvirtue in this life points to happiness as the consistent reward for\nvirtue in the next when accidents do not threaten to derail the\nnatural tendency.\n\nWhich is not to suggest that conscience, virtue, and self-love are\nidentical, although Butler connected them very deeply (Frey 1992 and\nn.p.). Although virtue tends to coincide with interest it tends to\ncoincide because a virtuous life is a life with the right balance of\nbenevolent passions and dispositions to make one happy and a life\nwhich responds to the unchanging and immediate moral authority of\nconscience \u2013 although they are approved of and motivated by\nself-love as well.\n\nButler uses benevolence mainly to refer to a particular passion or a\ncluster of passions (McNaughton 1992), although sometimes he also\nrefers to it and cognate terms (\u201clove of thy neighbor\u201d) as\nprinciples that might have particular passions as their objects. There\nis still a fair amount of scholarly disagreement as to which sense is\nmore central in Butler\u2019s arguments (nicely summarized in Irwin\n2008). Benevolence as a particular passion, like ambition or revenge,\nis never interested or disinterested in and of itself. It is only\ninterested or disinterested in so far as it is guided by or in\naccordance with our self-love. Acting in a benevolent manner might\nmake us happy. Indeed it seems to be the case that benevolent actions\nand affections often do make people happy. And we might initially\ndecide to gratify the passions of benevolence from self-love. But the\npassions themselves have no more or less connection to interest than\nany other passion does.\n\nNot being made happy by benevolent actions would point to a defect of\ntemper or a lack of balance in one\u2019s nature if the result was\ndiminished happiness and going against the dictates of conscience. As\nnoted, for both Butler and Shaftesbury, self-love and virtue converge\nwhen properly understood. But importantly according to Butler,\nShaftesbury erred in not recognizing that they could conflict in\nparticular cases, and if they did conflict the distinctive authority\nof conscience would trump our apparent prudential motivations. This\ndid not mean that our general interest conflicted with conscience, but\nrather that local prudential information could give reasons for\nparticular reasons for action that conflicted with conscience.\n\nThere is also some (more contested) evidence that Butler thought of\nbenevolence as a ruling principle (Rorty 1978). Butler referred to the\ngeneral principle of charity or \u201clove of our neighbor as\nthyself\u201d as a virtuous principle or as the reason-guided\nendeavor to promote the happiness of proximate others to the same\ndegree that one attempts to promote one\u2019s own good (although he\nalso identified \u201clove of neighbor\u201d with the particular\npassion of compassion). This was a regulating principle of action,\nperhaps distinct from benevolent passions. Butler suggested in Sermon\nIX that we have a fundamental obligation to the happiness of sensible\ncreatures other than ourselves insofar as they are capable of pleasure\nand pain, an obligation that can only be ignored in order to bring\nabout greater happiness (to be further discussed in Section 6).\nAlthough this appears to be a fundamental moral obligation to maximize\nwelfare a few years later Butler strongly criticized theories on which\nthe overall happiness is what makes an action good or evil and argued\nthat our conscience holds actions to be morally good or bad\nindependent of the expected or actual consequences for happiness\n(\u201cDissertation,\u201d \u00a75). Most of the secondary\nliterature takes Butler to generally be an anti-utilitarian (but see\nLouden 1995 and in a different way see Frey 1992, for a historical\noverview of interpretations see Garrett 2019), but there is\ndisagreement as to whether Butler held a consistent position or\nchanged his mind (see McPherson 1948\u20139). Some even argue that he\nmight be able to embrace a form of consequentialism (see McNaughton\n2017).\n\nFinally, Butler claimed that benevolence is the whole of virtue in\nSermon XII, although he qualified the claim later in Sermon XII and\nqualified it even more strongly in the \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue.\u201d Butler did not mean that to act benevolently in each\nand every action was the entirety of virtue, for example as we shall\nsee in the next section moral resentment was an appropriate attitude\nfor a virtuous agent. Rather he meant that to act according to and to\nbe motivated by the principle of loving one\u2019s neighbor generally\nleads to virtuous and morally approved actions. Although\nself-partiality tends in the opposite direction, benevolence offsets\nthis tendency and brings benevolent and self-partial affections in\nproper proportion. Conversely self-partiality brings benevolence in\nline with self-love such that it balances properly in our nature.\n\nAccording to Butler when we approve of virtue in an agent this gives\nrise to benevolence towards the agent. The ultimate object of this\nlove of benevolent moral agents is our love of God, the most\nbenevolent agent. In stressing the continuity between love of neighbor\nand love of God, Butler also stressed the continuity between our\napproval of moral agents and natural theology. Finally, to have a\ncharacter such that benevolent actions make one happy is normally to\nhave a character that encompasses all of the virtues.\n6. Compassion, Resentment, and Forgiveness\n\nCompassion was besides the love of God the most important of the\nparticular passions involving benevolence for Butler. He defined\ncompassion as \u201creal sorrow and concern for the misery of our\nfellow creatures\u201d giving rise to the desire to relieve their\ndistress (Sermon V Note 1). The passion of compassion arose from the\nimaginative ability to substitute another for oneself and thereby to\nbe affected by the distresses of that other with whom one\ncompassionates as towards oneself (Sermon V Note 1). Butler readily\nadmitted that the psychological process that gives rise to compassion\nincluded both pleasure in the fact that we were not suffering the\ndistress as well and awareness of our own susceptibility to the ills\nprompting distress in the object of our compassion. But although the\nprocess of giving rise to compassion also gives rise to and even\nincludes self-partial thoughts, \u201ccompassion\u201d refers\nstrictly to a \u201creal sorrow and concern for the misery of our\nfellow creatures\u201d (Sermon V Note 1). To identify it with a\nself-partial pleasure in the fact that we were not in distress or with\nthe desire to alleviate distress in order to no longer be annoyed by\nit was to be confused about the meaning of word. Although according to\nButler compassion, like any affection, must be governed by reason, the\nmotivation to virtuous actions that compassion gives rise to would not\nbe given rise to by reason alone. Consequently the passion of\ncompassion has a central role in our moral actions. Moreover, the\nprinciple of private self-love is not sufficient to serve our welfare\nwithout compassion, i.e., compassion is an important ingredient in our\nwell being in addition to being an important moral passion. Its\nimportance for our well being can be seen, according to Butler, in the\nfact that those who lack compassion, who have \u201chardness of\nheart,\u201d tend to have diminished happiness due to \u201chardness\nof heart\u201d (Sermon X, \u00a77) blocking the scope and degree of\ntheir happiness.\n\nResentment or anger was somewhat more difficult for Butler to deal\nwith insofar as it was ubiquitous to human beings but conflicted with\nthe Christian command to love our enemies. Butler made two\ndistinctions, between settled (or deliberate) and hasty (or sudden)\nresentment and between resentment raised by non-moral harm or\nresentment raised by moral injury. He further distinguished between\nresentment and the negative passion of malice (although he denies the\nexistence of disinterested, cool, direct ill-will or malice). Hasty\nresentment is an immediate response to \u201cmere harm without\nappearance of wrong or injustice\u201d (Sermon VIII, \u00a76). It can\nbe excessive and misguided, and one can be morally culpable for\nexcessive and misguided expressions of it, but hasty resentment serves\nan important end of self-preservation and care of one\u2019s near and\ndear. Settled resentment is an affection that has moral evil or\ninjustice as its object. Although moral evil gives rise to pain which\ncan strengthen this settled resentment, the object of the resentment\nis not the pain or harm done but instead the design or intention to\nmorally injure, harm, do wrong and injustice. And the goal of\nresentment is to cause appropriate injury in a wrongdoer, not malign\ninjury or revenge that are distinguished from resentment. For Butler,\nsettled resentment has an important moral end in drawing men together\nto pursue justice, in making them fear engendering resentment in\nmankind due to their actions, and to extirpate moral wickedness: it is\n\u201cone of the common bonds by which society is held together; a\nfellow-feeling, which each Individual has in behalf of the whole\nspecies, as well as of himself\u201d (Sermon VIII, \u00a78). Indeed\nButler goes so far as to suggest that communal moral resentment and\nthe justice it gives rise to is what separates us from the state of\nnature where each man is arbiter of his own punishment which quickly\ndevolves into revenge (a point developed further in Six Sermons).\n\nThis raises a central problem for resentment as a moral sentiment or\npassion: unless kept strictly within bounds it devolves into revenge\nand conflicts with benevolence and virtue. Part of the answer is that\nhowever extreme an injury done, and however settled the resentment\nrising in response, the execution of justice does not supersede the\nprior obligation of good will we have to all humans insofar as they\nare capable of happiness and misery. Rather we harm wrong doers to\npreserve \u201cthe quiet and happiness of the world\u201d and this\n\u201cgeneral and more enlarged obligation destroys a more particular\nand confined one of the same kind, inconsistent with it. Guilt and\ninjury then does not dispense with or supersede the duty of\ngoodwill,\u201d (Sermon IX \u00a715). Another part of the answer is\nthat since the proper object is the injustice, to resent\nsomeone\u2019s whole character as opposed to the particular aspect of\ncharacter that gave rise to the harm, i.e. to portray them as wholly\nmonstrous, is to move beyond the appropriate bounds. This pitfall is\neasier to avoid when we recognize our own mixed characters and flaws.\nRelatedly, and perhaps most importantly one must recognize that\nself-partiality is often fueling a desire for revenge against those we\nresent insofar as they have injured us. We ought to attempt to view\ninjuries to us from as distant and unprejudiced a human viewpoint as\npossible \u2014 with full awareness of our own future non-existence\nand final judgment \u2013 and when we do we will be able to recognize\nthat our enemies are as often as not mistaken or acting\ninadvertently.\n\nThe awareness of our own flaws, and our acceptance of the\nnon-existence of cool, disinterested and malign wills as well as our\nrecognition of the ubiquity of mixed characters also gives rise to\ncompassion and the desire to forgive. But notably for Butler\nforgiveness does not entail giving up resentment for moral wrongs\n(Griswold 2008; Garcia 2011). Rather it entails checking inappropriate\nresentment, anger, and revenge, being aware when what appears to be a\nmoral harm is in fact an inadvertent injury whose putative moral\ninjustice is inflated by our own partiality, and treating others who\nharm us with the same compassion that we hold all humans due good-will\nshould be treated (Radzik 2014).\n7. Self-Deceit and Ignorance\n\nButler devoted three of his Sermons to issues connected with\nself-deceit (IV, VI, X). The focus on the pervasiveness of self-deceit\nas a serious moral problem is an important difference between Butler\nand his more optimistic confreres Hutcheson and Shaftesbury. For\nButler we are often self-deceived even when we think we are doing what\nis morally right (in fact if we think we are wholly in the right we\nare almost always deceived (Sermon X \u00a713)) and we often only\nrecognize our self-deception \u2014 if at all \u2014 upon later\nreflection. That we are so prone to self-deception is mainly due to a\nlack of reflection when acting prompted by self-partiality.\n\nAccording to Butler, most of us can access what the right thing is to\ndo in most circumstances, and most of us often wish to do the right\nthing when it doesn\u2019t conflict with our self-partiality. But we\nare also susceptible to engage in self-deceit in order to justify\nacting on self-partial motives even when it conflicts with what is\nmorally right. Butler illustrated this sort of self-deceit by\nreference to the example of Balaam, a prophet who had been asked to\ncurse the Israelites by the Moabites. Even though God expressly\nforbade Balaam, he still considered cursing the Israelites when\ngreater rewards were offered by Moabite ambassadors. The puzzle was\nhow could Balaam know what was right but still be motivated to do what\nwas wrong? Butler\u2019s answer was not so much to try to solve the\nproblem of akrasia as to describe the moral psychology of\nself-deceit.\n\nBalaam\u2019s moral failure was effected by his avoiding reflecting\non his actions, by a pervasive asymmetry in how we view ourselves and\nhow we view others due to native self-partiality that can only be\ncorrected by reflection, and by a difficulty in discerning the exact\ndegree to which we are obliged to act morally. The three are\ninterconnected. We are normally happy to unreflectively cut more slack\nfor ourselves than we are willing to cut for others due to\nself-partiality or an \u201coverfondness for ourselves\u201d (Sermon\nX \u00a76). When a morally right action is a matter of degree, it is\neasy and common to avoid reflection and to err on the side of\nself-partiality in the degree in which the moral action is undertaken.\nThis allows one to engage in more and more immoral acts while\nconvincing oneself that each undermining of the rule is justified and\nreasonable. In the story of Balaam, Balaam invites the ambassadors to\nstay the night under the aegis of hospitality. By analogy for Butler\nwe undermine rules under the aegis of ordinary sociability and\ncivility \u2014 for example we engage in self-serving malicious\ngossip under the aegis of being sociable \u2014 and gradually\nundermine our capacity to act from the dictate of conscience when\ncalled upon to do so.\n\nSince conscience is authoritative and proximate for Butler, and since\nthe dictates of conscience coincide with our self-love, self-deceit\nonly gets off the ground if we avoid reflection or if we reflect\npoorly. In addition to the oversimplifying and bad faith just\ndescribed, we give self-deceit a foothold by refusing to look at or\navoiding the facts of the matter when we feel these facts will go\nagainst our self-partial desires \u2014 Butler gives the example of\nprofligate spenders not looking at the state of their finances (Sermon\nX \u00a711) \u2014 and by relying piecemeal on the counsel of others\nwhen these counsels serve our interest.\n\nIn one of his less read sermons (Sermon IV) Butler suggests that\ncareful government of the tongue is important to one\u2019s moral\nwell being. The role of others \u2014 both our oppositions to and\nagreements with others \u2014 and its relation to self-governance is\nparticularly crucial for Butler in explaining this sort of\nself-deceit. Our tendency to paint the characters of others in black\nand white allows us to justify our immoral actions by virtue of the\nfact that we self-deceptively (and self-righteously) cast ourselves\nand our motivations as wholly good in opposition to our opponent who\nis wholly evil, and so we can treat them however we see fit. We also\ndraw on the idle comments of others that conform with our self-partial\ndesires to serve as external justification of our immoral actions.\n\nThe problem then is given human beings\u2019 great capacity for\nself-deceit, how can it be prevented? Is not the attempt to prevent\nself-deceit as prone to self-deceit as anything else? Butler\u2019s\nanswer is that habitual and systematic self-reflection and\nself-governance by rigid rules are the best response. In a manner\nreminiscent of Epictetus\u2019 famous maxim one must watch oneself as\nan enemy lying in ambush, and view one\u2019s actions as an enemy\nwould judging them harshly, Butler suggests a two part rule to this\nend \u201cOne is, to substitute another for yourself, when you take a\nsurvey of any part of your behavior, or consider what is proper and\nfit and reasonable for you to do on any occasion: the other part is,\nthat you\u2026 consider yourself as the person affected by such a\nbehavior,\u201d (Sermon X \u00a715). The rule \u201citself may be\ndishonestly applied\u201d but even the misguided attempt to apply it\nmay reveal more truth than not applying it at all. In the\nAnalogy Butler argued that one of the central moral purposes\nof this life is as a probationary period in the acquisition of habits\nof self-governance (Analogy V). That these habits are not\nfool-proof is a consequence of the fact that our ability to apply them\nseriously to ourselves is one of the bases for our ultimate punishment\nand reward.\n\nThe problem of self-deceit is connected to another of Butler\u2019s\nabiding themes, human ignorance of the larger design of God. In Sermon\nXV \u201cUpon Human Ignorance\u201d (notably the final sermon of the\ncollection), the Analogy and the \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue,\u201d Butler stressed that our knowledge of design is\nprobable at best. Sermon XV concludes with an exhortation reminiscent\nof Locke. Since we have such limited knowledge of providence and of\nGod\u2019s design, we should turn our attention to that which we can\nhave knowledge of: our nature insofar as it bears on our moral\ngovernance and conduct.\n\nThe argument of the Analogy and the \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue\u201d were both premised on this. In the Analogy,\nButler argued that we have probable evidence that our morally right\nand wrong actions will be judged and rewarded and punished by God and\nthat this life is a probationary period where we act in ways that will\nultimately be judged.\n8. Influence\n\nButler\u2019s Sermons were read in the eighteenth century, in\nparticular after the publication of the Analogy, and went\nthrough multiple editions. The Analogy was reprinted many\ntimes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as were\nButler\u2019s works. His initial influence seems to have been\ngreatest on Scottish philosophers, including (perhaps) his\ncontemporary Francis Hutcheson, George Turnbull, David Fordyce, David\nHume, Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, and their fellow travellers \u2014\nnotably Edmund Burke. Hume sought to meet Butler and emended the\nmanuscript copy of A Treatise on Human Nature he gave to him\nfor fear it would cause offense. Hume\u2019s and Smith\u2019s\naccounts of sympathy, compassion, resentment, justice, and their\nempirical attitude towards moral psychology (and to the centrality of\nmoral psychology for ethics) and the limits of metaphysical\nexplanations in morals bear Butler\u2019s influence. Hume\u2019s\ndiscussion of induction in his Treatise has also been seen as\na criticism of Butler\u2019s procedure in the Analogy\n(Russell 2008). Butler was also widely read in Germany. Solomon\nMaimon, for example, quotes Butler\u2019s \u201cDissertation on\nVirtue\u201d in the Preface to his Autobiography. In the\nlate nineteenth and early twentieth century Butler\u2019s\nSermons became more influential than the Analogy,\ndue to their influence at Oxford and Cambridge and particularly on\nWilliam Whewell (see Tennant 195\u2013199) and Sidgwick. Throughout\nthe later nineteenth century and the twentieth century they were\ndiscussed by and had great impact on many of the central moral\nphilosophers of the Anglo-American tradition \u2014 G. E. Moore, H.\nA. Pritchard, and particularly W. D. Ross, among many. Butler\u2019s\ninfluence and importance has persisted (see, for example, the section\non Butlerian Accounts in the entry on\n forgiveness).\n",
