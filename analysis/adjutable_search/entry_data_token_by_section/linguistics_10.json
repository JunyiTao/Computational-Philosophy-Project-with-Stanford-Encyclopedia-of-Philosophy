    "main_text": "The Subject Matter of Linguistic Theories || Components of linguistic theories\n2.5 Components of linguistic theories\n\nLinguists\u2019 conception of the components of the study of language\ncontrast with philosophers\u2019 conceptions (even those of\nphilosophers of language) in at least three ways. First, linguists are\noften intensely interested in small details of linguistic form in\ntheir own right. Second, linguists take an interest in whole topic\nareas like the internal structure of phrases, the physics of\npronunciation, morphological features such as conjugation classes,\nlexical information about particular words, and so on\u2014topics in\nwhich there is typically little philosophical payoff. And third,\nlinguists are concerned with relations between the different\nsubsystems of languages: the exact way the syntax meshes with the\nsemantics, the relationship between phonological and syntactic facts,\nand so on.\n\nWith regard to form, philosophers broadly follow Morris (1938), a\nfoundational work in semiotics, and to some extent Peirce (see SEP\nentry: Peirce, semiotics), in thinking of the theory of language as\nhaving three main components:\n\nsyntax, which treats of the form of signs;\nsemantics, which deals with the relations of signs to\ntheir denotations; and\npragmatics, which concerns the contextualized use of\ninterpreted signs.\n\n\nLinguists, by contrast, following both Sapir (1921) and Bloomfield\n(1933), treat the syntactic component in a more detailed way than\nMorris or Peirce, and distinguish between at least three kinds of\nlinguistic form: the form of speech sounds (phonology), the form of\nwords (morphology), and the form of sentences. (If syntax is about the\nform of expressions in general, then each of these would be an element\nof Morris\u2019s syntax.)\n\nEmergentists in general deny that there is a distinction between\nsemantics and pragmatics\u2014a position that is familiar enough in\nphilosophy: Quine (1987: 211), for instance, holds that \u201cthe\nseparation between semantics and pragmatics is a pernicious\nerror.\u201d And generally speaking, those theorists who, like the\nlater Wittgenstein, focus on meaning as use will deny that one can\nseparate semantics from pragmatics. Emergentists such as Paul Hopper\n& Sandra Thompson agree:\n\n[W]hat is called semantics and what is called pragmatics are an\nintegrated whole. (Hopper and Thompson 1993: 372)\n\n\nSome Essentialists\u2014notably Chomsky\u2014also deny that\nsemantics can be separated from pragmatics, but unlike the\nEmergentists (who think that semantics-pragmatics is a starting point\nfor linguistic theory), Chomsky (as we noted briefly in section 1.3)\ndenies that semantics and pragmatics can have any role in\nlinguistics:\n\n\nIt seems that other cognitive systems\u2014in particular, our system\nof beliefs concerning things in the world and their\nbehavior\u2014play an essential part in our judgments of meaning and\nreference, in an extremely intricate manner, and it is not at all\nclear that much will remain if we try to separate the purely\nlinguistic components of what in informal usage or even in technical\ndiscussion we call \u2018the meaning of [a] linguistic\nexpression.\u2019 (Chomsky 1979; 142)\n\n\nRegarding the theoretical account of the relation between words or\nphrases and what speakers take them to refer to, Chomsky says,\n\u201cI think such theories should be regarded as a variety of\nsyntax\u201d (Chomsky 1992: 223).\n\nNot every Essentialist agrees with Chomsky on this point. Many believe\nthat every theory should incorporate a linguistic component that\nyields meanings, in much the same way that many philosophers of\nlanguage believe there to be such a separate component. Often,\nalthough not always, this component amounts to a truth-theoretic\naccount of the values of syntactically-characterized sentences. This\ntypically involves a translation of the natural language sentence into\nsome representation that is \u201cintermediate\u201d between natural\nlanguage and a truth-theory\u2014perhaps an augmented version of\nfirst-order logic, or perhaps a higher-order intensional language. The\nEssentialists who study semantics in such ways usually agree with\nChomsky in seeing little role for pragmatics within linguistic theory.\nBut their separation of semantics from pragmatics allows them to\naccord semantics a legitimacy within linguistics itself, and not just\nin psychology or sociology.\n\nSuch Essentialists, as well as the Emergentists, differ in important\nways from classical philosophical logic in their attitudes towards\n\u201cthe syntactic-semantic interface\u201d, however. Philosophers\nof language and logic who are not also heavily influenced by\nlinguistics tend to move directly\u2014perhaps by means of a\n\u201csemantic intuition\u201d or perhaps from an intuitive\nunderstanding of the truth conditions involved\u2014from a natural\nlanguage sentence to its \u201cdeep, logical\u201d representation.\nFor example, they may move directly from (EX1) to (LF1):\n\n(EX1)\nEvery linguist admires P\u0101nini.\n(LF1)\nx(Linguist(x) \u2283 Admires(x,\np))\n\n\nAnd from there perhaps to a model-theoretic description of its\ntruth-conditions. A linguist, on the other hand, would aim to describe\nhow (EX1) and (LF1) are related. From the point of view of a\nsemantically-inclined Essentialist, the question is: how should the\nsyntactic component of linguistic theory be written so that the\nsemantic value (or, \u201clogical form representation\u201d) can be\nassigned? From some Emergentist points of view, the question is: how\ncan the semantic properties and communicative function of an\nexpression explain its syntactic properties?\n\nMatters are perhaps less clear with the Externalists\u2014at least\nwith those who identify semantic value with distribution in terms of\nneighboring words (there is a tradition stemming from the\nstructuralists of equating synonymy with the possibility of\nsubstitution in all contexts without affecting acceptability).\n\nMatters are in general quite a bit more subtle and tricky than (EX1)\nmight suggest. Philosophers have taken the natural language sentence\n(EX2) to have two logical forms, (LF2a) and (LF2b):\n\n(EX2)\nEvery linguist admires a philosopher.\n(LF2a)\n\u2200x(Linguist(x) \u2283\n\u2203y(Philosopher(y) \u2227\nAdmires(x,y)))\n(LF2b)\n\u2203x(Philosopher(x) \u2227\n\u2200y(Linguist(y) \u2283\nAdmires(y,x)))\n\n\nBut for the linguist interested in the syntax-semantics interface,\nthere needs to be some explanation of how (LF2a) and (LF2b) are\nassociated with (EX2). It could be a way in which rules can derive\n(LF2a) and (LF2b) from the syntactic representation of (EX2), as some\nsemantically-inclined Essentialists would propose, or a way to explain\nthe syntactic properties of (EX2) from facts about the meanings\nrepresented by (LF2a) and (LF2b), as some Emergentists might want. But\nthat they should be connected up in some way is something that\nlinguists would typically count as non-negotiable.\n",
