    "main_text": "Problems with Reductionism\n4. Problems with Reductionism\n\nDifferent accounts of theory reduction and explanatory reduction face\nseveral potential problems. Some critiques of (epistemic) reductionism\nemphasize that the effects of molecular processes strongly depend on\nthe context in which they occur, so that one molecular kind\ncan correspond to many higher level kinds\n (Section 4.1).\n Another significant challenge to reductionism stems from the fact\nthat higher level biological structures and processes can be (and\ntypically are) realized by different kinds of molecular processes, so\nthat many molecular kinds can correspond to one\nhigher level kind\n (Section 4.2).\n Finally, because biological processes must be represented before they\ncan be explained (Sarkar 1998), two further features become salient as\nissues for explanatory reduction: temporality and intrinsicality\n (Section 4.3).\n",
