    "main_text": "The intelligibility of the new geometries || Poincar\u00e9 versus Russell\n7. Concluding remarks\n\nThis essay has examined the main branches in the development of\ngeometry until the early years of the 20th century under\nthe headings of theoretical or abstract knowledge, empirical and other\nanalyses of the intelligibility of such knowledge, and the deductive\ncharacter of that knowledge.\n\nThe status of the straight line in elementary Euclidean geometry as\nboth the shortest curve joining any two of its points and as the curve\nthat points always in the same direction was disentangled. One line of\nenquiry led to geometries that emphasised straightness as the\nfundamental property (typically, projective geometry) and the other to\ngeometries that emphasised the shortest aspect. The former approach\nwas seen from the start as a non-metrical one, and became the favoured\narena for formal, even axiomatic investigations of geometry as a\ndeductive enterprise. The price was having less and less to say about\nphysical space (as Poincar\u00e9 observed). The concept of geometry\nwas radically enlarged, but in ways that were not intended to be\naccounts of physical space or experiential space.\n\nThe metrical account led to a progressive elucidation of a significant\nobscurity in Euclid\u2019s Elements: the parallel postulate.\nFor much of the 19th century, non-Euclidean geometries\n(like Lobachevskii's) were the only alternative to Euclid\u2019s that\nwas proposed as an intelligible geometry, even though it was generally\nagreed that only the most delicate experiments could hope to decide\nthe matter. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s contested view was that no\nexperiment could so decide, and this raised important issues about the\nway abstract terms are to be interpreted and the role of hypotheses in\nscientific theory.\n\nBeyond the eye-catching and thought-provoking idea of a physical\ngeometry alternative to Euclid\u2019s system, which had stood for two\nthousand years, there was the panoply of metrical geometries hinted at\nin work on differential geometry by Gauss and above all by Riemann.\nHere it finally proved possible to explain the relationship between\nstraightest and shortest in a suitably general setting. It also became\npossible to discuss geometry as a body of ideas that grew out of naive\nideas of length, angle, shape, and size, and to do so in a\nsophisticated and rigorous way. What had been regarded as inescapable\naxiomatic truths, necessary truths, now became hypothetical\nassumptions that could be modified in many ways; the old notion of an\naxiom yielded gradually to the modern one. It was also possible to\ncontemplate all kinds of theoretical structures as\n\u2018spaces\u2019, whether or not they were presented axiomatically\nor intended as distillations of intelligible experience. In this way,\nit became possible to apply geometrical ideas in novel settings and in\nnovel ways. Geometrisation has been ubiquitous in maths and science\never since.\n\nAfter 1900, it was clear that Euclidean geometry had lost its\npre-eminent position. This ancient system lost its certainty, and\nthere were better formal, axiomatic systems, such as those proposed by\nHilbert and some mathematicians in the school around Peano. There\nwere rich systems that were more fundamental, in the sense of using\nfewer properties of the figures of traditional geometry such as the\nstraight line (the many versions of projective geometry). And there\nwas a profusion of metrical geometries with more natural starting\npoints and deeper theories.\n\nAs a result, ideas about how theoretical geometry of whatever kind\nrelates to the space around us had become much more sophisticated.\nFrom the standpoint of pure mathematics, the situation was one of\npluralism. The truth of geometry was no longer to be taken for\ngranted, notoriously the Kantian viewpoint was generally abandoned.\nChoosing a physical geometry had become, in some measure, an empirical\nquestion \u2014if we assume Poincar\u00e9 was not right. Philosophical\nideas about the intelligibility of geometry had also deepened. Perhaps\nalso from the standpoint of general science one ought to consider a\npluralistic outlook.\n",
