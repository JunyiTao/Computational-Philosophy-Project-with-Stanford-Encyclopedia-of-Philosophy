    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nArthur has the measles and stays in a closed environment with his\nsister Mafalda. If Mafalda ends up contracting the measles herself\nbecause of her staying in close contact with Arthur, there must be\nsomething\u2014the measles virus\u2014which is transmitted from\nArthur to Mafalda in virtue of a relation\u2014the relation of\nstaying in close contact with one another\u2014instantiated by the\ntwo siblings. Epistemologists have been devoting their attention to\nthe fact that epistemic properties\u2014like being justified\nor known\u2014are often transmitted in a similar way. An example (not\ndiscussed in this entry) is the transmission of knowledge via\ntestimony. A different but equally important phenomenon (which\noccupies center stage in this entry) is the transmission of epistemic\njustification across an inference or argument from one proposition to\nanother.\n\nConsider proposition \\(q\\) constituting the conclusion of an argument\nhaving proposition \\(p\\) as premise (where \\(p\\) can be a set or\nconjunction of propositions). If \\(p\\) is justified for a subject\n\\(s\\) by evidence \\(e\\), this justification may transmit to \\(q\\) if\n\\(s\\) is aware of the entailment between \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). When this\nhappens, \\(q\\) is justified for \\(s\\) in virtue of her\njustification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) and her knowledge of the\ninferential relation from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\). Consider this example from\nWright (2002):\n\nToadstool\n\n\\(\\rE_1\\).\n Three hours ago, Jones inadvertently consumed a large risotto of\nBoletus Satana.\n\\(\\rP_1\\).\n Jones has absorbed a lethal quantity of the toxins that toadstool\ncontains.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_1\\).\n Jones will shortly die.\n\n\n\nHere \\(s\\) can deductively infer\n \\(\\rQ_1\\)\n from\n \\(\\rP_1\\)\n given background information.[1]\n Suppose \\(s\\) acquires justification for \\(\\rP_1\\) by learning\n \\(\\rE_1\\).\n \\( s\\) will also acquire justification for \\(\\rQ_1\\) in virtue of her\nknowledge of the inferential relation from \\(\\rP_1\\) to \\(\\rQ_1\\) and\nher justification for\n \\(\\rP_1\\).[2]\n Thus, \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(\\rP_1\\) will transmit to\n\\(\\rQ_1\\).\n\nIt is widely recognized that epistemic justification sometimes\nfails to transmit across an inference or argument. In\ninteresting cases of transmission failure, \\(s\\) has justification for\nbelieving \\(p\\) and knows the inferential link between \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\), but \\(s\\) has no justification for believing \\(q\\) in\nvirtue of her justification for \\(p\\) and her knowledge of the\ninferential link. Here is an example from Wright (2003). Suppose\n\\(s\\)\u2019s background information entails that Jessica and Jocelyn\nare indistinguishable twins. Consider this possible reasoning:\n\nTwins\n\n\\(\\rE_2\\). \nThis girl looks just like Jessica.\n\\(\\rP_2\\).\n This girl is actually Jessica.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_2\\).\n This girl is not Jocelyn.\n\n\n\nIn Twins\n\\(\\rE_2\\)\n can give \\(s\\) justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n only if \\(s\\) has independent justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\n in the first instance. Suppose that \\(s\\) does have independent\njustification for believing \\(\\rQ_2\\), and imagine that \\(s\\) learns\n\\(\\rE_2\\). In this case \\(s\\) will acquire justification for believing\n\\(\\rP_2\\) from \\(\\rE_2\\). But it is intuitive that \\(s\\) will acquire\nno justification for \\(\\rQ_2\\) in virtue of her justification\nfor believing \\(\\rP_2\\) based on \\(\\rE_2\\) and her knowledge of the\ninferential link between \\(\\rP_2\\) and \\(\\rQ_2\\). So, Twins\ninstantiates transmission failure when \\(\\rQ_2\\) is independently\njustified.\n\nAn argument incapable of transmitting to its conclusion a\nspecific justification for its premise(s)\u2014e.g., a\njustification based on evidence \\(e\\)\u2014may be able to transmit to\nthe same conclusion a different justification for its\npremise(s)\u2014e.g., one based on different evidence \\(e^*\\).\nReplace for instance\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n with \n\n\\(\\rE_2^*.\\)\n This girl\u2019s passport certifies she is Jessica.\n\n\nin Twins,\n \\(\\rE_2^*\\)\n can provide \\(s\\) with justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n even if \\(s\\) has no independent justification for\n \\(\\rQ_2\\).\n Suppose then that \\(s\\) has no independent justification for\n\\(\\rQ_2\\), and that she acquires \\(\\rE_2^*\\). It is intuitive that\n\\(s\\) will acquire justification from \\(\\rE_2^*\\) for \\(\\rP_2\\) that\ndoes transmit to \\(\\rQ_2\\). Now the inference from \\(\\rP_2\\) to\n\\(\\rQ_2\\) instantiates epistemic transmission.\n\nAlthough many of the epistemologists participating in the debate on\nepistemic transmission and transmission failure speak of transmission\nof warrant, rather than justification, almost all of\nthem use the term \u2018warrant\u2019 to refer to some kind of\nepistemic justification (in\n Sect. 3.3\n we will however consider an account of warrant transmission failure\nin which \u2018warrant\u2019 is interpreted differently.) Most\nepistemologists investigating epistemic transmission and transmission\nfailure\u2014e.g., Wright (2011, 2007, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 1985),\nDavies (2003, 2000 and 1998), Dretske (2005), Pryor (2004), Moretti\n(2012) and Moretti & Piazza (2013)\u2014broadly identify the\nepistemic property capable of being transmitted with\npropositional\n justification.[3]\n Only a few authors explicitly focus on transmission of\ndoxastic justification\u2014e.g., Silins (2005), Davies\n(2009) and Tucker (2010a and 2010b\n [OIR]).\n In this entry we follow the majority in discussing transmission and\ntransmission failure of justification as phenomena primarily\npertaining to propositional justification. (See however the supplement\non\n Transmission of Propositional Justification versus Transmission of Doxastic Justification.)\n\nEpistemologists typically concentrate on transmission of\n(propositional or doxastic) justification across deductively\nvalid (given background information) arguments. The fact that\njustification can transmit across deduction is crucial for our\ncognitive processes because it makes the advancement of\nknowledge\u2014or justified belief\u2014through deductive reasoning\npossible. Suppose evidence \\(e\\) gives you justification for believing\nhypothesis \\(p\\), and you know that \\(p\\) entails another proposition\n\\(q\\) that you haven\u2019t directly checked. If the justification\nyou have for believing \\(p\\) transmits to its unchecked prediction\n\\(q\\) through the entailment, you acquire justification for believing\n\\(q\\) too.\n\nEpistemologists may analyze epistemic transmission across\ninductive (or ampliative) inferences too. Yet this\ntopic has received much less attention in the literature on epistemic\ntransmission. (See however interesting remarks in Tucker 2010a.) \n\nIn the remaining part of this entry we will focus on transmission and\ntransmission failure of propositional justification across deductive\ninference. Unless differently specified, by \u2018epistemic\njustification\u2019 or \u2018justification\u2019 we always mean\n\u2018propositional justification\u2019.\n",
