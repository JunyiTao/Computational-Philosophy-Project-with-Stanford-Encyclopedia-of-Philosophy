    "main_text": "The Tractatus Politicus || Constitutionalism and Model Regimes\n4.3 Constitutionalism and Model Regimes\n\n\nTo see how Spinoza provides a general response to the question of how\npeace or civic agreement is promoted, we must bear in mind that the\nrelation of agreement comes in degrees (see Blom 1993; Steinberg\n2009). Total agreement, what Blom calls \u201cmaximal\nagreement,\u201d is possible only to the extent that men are fully\nrational (EIVP31\u2013EIVP35). A society of free men would be a perfect\nunion (EIVP67\u201373). However, the free man exists only as an ideal; all\nactual men are imperfectly rational. The concern of the state is to\nbring it about that the actual relationships between people most\nclosely approximate the ideal society of free men. That is, the aim of\nthe state is to make irrational, selfish men as rational and virtuous\nas possible. (For tension between idealist and realist features of\nSpinoza\u2019s political thought, see Armstrong 2009).\n\n\nSpinoza\u2019s solution, in broad form, is to adopt constitutional measures\nand institutional procedures that channel the natural passions of men\ntowards the common good. The vision here is one of mechanizing reason\nin much the same way the Venetian Republic is said to have\nmechanized virt\u00f9 (Pocock 1975, 284), a vision much\nindebted to the works of the De la Courts. Civil rationality is the\nproduct of a republican set of institutions that encourage broad\nparticipation, public deliberation, and the adoption of a variety of\naccountability-promoting mechanisms. A rationally organized state will\nnot only promote the common good, in so doing it will also strengthen\nthe civic commitment of its citizens; this is one key way in which the\nstate contributes to the reorientation of the affects of its citizens\nand increases the level of agreement between citizens, the product of\nwhich is harmony or peace (Steinberg 2009; Steinberg 2018a)\n4.3.1 Monarchy\n\n\nGiven that the fundamental aim of the state is peace, the question\nthat Spinoza seeks to address in chapters 6 and 7 of the\nPolitical Treatise is how a monarchy is to be\norganized so as to be maximally peaceful. He begins by repeating the\nclaim that men are largely irrational and selfish. And since the\npassions of common men must be regulated, it is tempting to suppose, as\nHobbes does, that heavy-handed governance is required. But Spinoza\nclaims that even if a despot is able to minimize violence and dissent,\nas the Turkish Sultans were (6/4), this produces only \u201cslavery,\nbarbarism, and desolation,\u201d not the sort of peace or agreement\namong men that is the true end of the state. Indeed, Spinoza claims\nthat the more completely authority is vested in one man the worse off\neveryone is, including the despot himself (6/8). This is because the\nKing is likely to look after his advantage alone, neglecting the\ngeneral welfare, which will ultimately result in the weakening of the\ncivitas. In order to overcome this condition, it is essential\nfor there to be constitutional checks on the behavior of the monarch.\nThese foundational laws are to be understood as the king\u2019s\n\u201cpermanent decrees\u201d [aeterna decreta], expressing\nhis real interests, which are not to be contravened. Spinoza likens\nthese \u201cdecrees\u201d to Ulysses\u2019 order that his oarsmen\nkeep him bound to the mast of his ship even when he is beckoned by the\nSirens\u2019 song (7/1). One of the central constitutional checks is\nthat the King deliberate with, and in some sense answer to, a large\ncouncil composed of citizens (6/15\u201330). Moreover, since the council\nmembers too are likely to be selfish and venal, it is important that\ntheir private interests are bound up with the common good (7/4; cf. 7/27\u201329). As\nMcShea puts it, a properly constituted state will be like a\n\u201chomeostatic mechanism\u201d (1968, 109), correcting divisive or\ndestructive tendencies by ensuring that an individual\u2019s interests\nis always tied to the interests of others. For instance, Spinoza writes\nthat in a properly constituted state:\n\n\nThe king\u2026whether motivated by fear of the people or by his\ndesire to win over the greater part of an armed populace, or whether\nhe is led by nobility of spirit to have regard to the public interest,\nwill always ratify the opinion that is supported by most votes-i.e.,\n(by Section 5 of this Chapter), that is of the greater advantage to\nthe greater part of the state; or else he will try, if possible, to\nreconcile the differing opinions submitted to him so as to gain\npopularity with all (7/11).\n\n\nUltimately, a model monarchy will be a constitutional monarchy that will strongly resemble a democracy. This fits with\nMatheron\u2019s suggestion that, because state power is fundamentally\nbased in the power of the people, those states that deviate least from\na democracy will be most powerful (Matheron 1997). Nevertheless, the\nfact that Spinoza countenanced the possibility that \u201ca people can\npreserve a considerable degree of freedom under a king\u201d (7/31), can be\nseen as a resignation to the reality of Orangism after the events of\n1672 (Blom 2007; Steinberg 2008).\n4.3.2 Aristocracy\n\n\nSpinoza discusses two types of aristocracy and the best forms of\neach. The first is a centralized aristocracy that appears to have been\nmodeled on the Venetian Republic (McShea 1968, 117; Haitsma Mulier\n1980). The second is a decentralized aristocracy, in which sovereignty\nis held by several cities. This type of aristocracy, which Spinoza\ntakes to be superior (9/15), is evidently modeled on the\nUnited Provinces. While Spinoza\u2019s recommendations vary between these\ntwo types of aristocracy, many of the general features remain the\nsame. Spinoza argues, in proto-Madisonian fashion, that the council of\npatricians must be sizable so as to reduce the potential for\nfactionalism (e.g., 8/1; 8/38). He also claims that a large council\nwill protect against selfish or irrational governance (8/6; 9/14). As\nis the case in Spinoza\u2019s discussion of monarchy, the emphasis here is\non finding mechanisms that balance the interests of participants and\nencourage cohesion (e.g., 8/19\u20138/24). One important way in which\ncohesion is encouraged is through the promulgation of the\n\u201cuniversal faith\u201d or civil religion set out in TTP 16\n(8/46).\n\n\nGiven that there will generally be more checks on authority and a\ngreater diffusion of political power in aristocracies than in\nmonarchies, we should not find it surprising that Spinoza claims that\naristocracies are likely to be more absolute than monarchies (8/7),\nsince a state is \u201cabsolute\u201d to the extent that it\nincorporates the rights of all its members and minimizes the basis for\ndissent (8/3, 8/4, 8/7; Steinberg 2018b).  Absoluteness thus indicates a norm very much\nlike peace, the cardinal civil norm; so to say that one regime form is\nmore absolute than another amounts to declaring its superiority.\n\n\nWhile Spinoza clearly indicates that aristocracies are, on the whole\nand in most cases, superior to monarchies, a more interesting and\nsomewhat more vexed question is how aristocracies compare with\ndemocracies. Raia Prokhovnik, for example, has claimed that\naristocracy is \u201cthe form of government [Spinoza] on mature\nreflection prefers\u201d (2004, 210; cf. Feuer 1987 and Melamed 2013). I believe that\nthere are strong reasons for denying that aristocracy displaces\ndemocracy in the TP as Spinoza\u2019s preferred regime. Spinoza does note\nthat the election of patricians as opposed to the birthright\nprivileges of participants in a democracy gives aristocracies an\nadvantage in theory (11/2). However, this advantage is offset by the\nbiased, self-serving practices of most patricians (ibid.). And since\nSpinoza claims that democracy is the most absolute form of regime\n(e.g., 11/1), it would seem that\u2014again, on the whole and in most\ncases\u2014Spinoza favors democracy. Ultimately, though, Spinoza is\nless interested in rank-ordering regimes than he is in determining how\neach regime-type must be organized in order to maximize freedom and\nthe common good.\n4.3.3 Democracy\n\n\nSpinoza had barely begun writing the first of what would likely have\nbeen two chapters on democracy when he died on February 21, 1677. His\nconception of democracy includes any system of popular governance in\nwhich the governing members acquire the right to participate by virtue\nof their civil status rather than by election. This conception of\ndemocracy is broad enough to include even variants of timocracy.\nSpinoza\u2019s own model democracy excludes all those who are not\nsui iuris\u2014e.g., women, servants (servos), and\nforeigners\u2014as well those who do not lead \u201crespectable lives\u201d\n(honesteque vivunt) (11/3). These elitist and exclusionary\naspects of Spinoza\u2019s democracy taint what would otherwise appear to be\na rather progressive form of democracy, from as much as we can glean\nfrom remarks scattered throughout the text.\n\n\nThe general tenor of Spinoza\u2019s democracy is easy to infer from his\ndiscussions of monarchy and aristocracy, both of which include strong\ndemocratic elements. What is particularly interesting is how Spinoza\ndefends these democratic features, since this gives us insight into\nhow democracies are to be defended in general. In the TTP Spinoza seems to\nprovides both principled and instrumental arguments in favor of\ndemocracy. The principled reason is that democracies preserve men\u2019s\nnatural equality (TTP 16, 202) and natural freedom (TTP 5/65). The major\ninstrumental defense of democracy is that \u201cthere is less reason\nin a democratic state to fear absurd proceedings\u201d (16/184). In\nthe TP, Spinoza focuses exclusively on the instrumental defense,\nhighlighting what has recently been called the epistemic advantage of\ndemocracy, i.e., the tendency of popular assemblies to legislate more\nwisely than other legislative bodies (e.g., Cohen, 1986; Estlund 1997;\nSteinberg 2010a; cf. entry on\n democracy. \nFor instance, he repeats his claim that larger councils are more\nlikely to be rational because collective decisions force members to\n\u201chave as their objective what is honourable, or at least appears\nso\u201d (8/6).  He claims that the deliberative features of\nlarge governing bodies improve competency, since \u201cmen\u2019s wits are\ntoo obtuse to get straight to the heart of every question, but by\ndiscussing, listening to others, and debating, their wits are\nsharpened\u201d (9/14). Spinoza also rebuffs those who claim that\nthere is \u201cno truth or judgment in the common people\u201d\n(7/27), claiming that \u201call men share in one and the same\nnature\u201d and that differences in competency stem primarily from\nthe fact that the masses are kept ignorant of the most important\naffairs of the state (ibid.; cf. 7/4). Contrary to Feuer\u2019s suggestion\nthat events such as the murders of the de Witts led to an\nanti-democratic turn in Spinoza\u2019s thought, these passages reveal the\ndepth of Spinoza\u2019s commitment to democracy and his refusal to endorse\nthe thesis that some men are innately more fit to govern than\nothers. So despite the fact that the explicit discussion of democracy\nin the TP was largely preempted by the author\u2019s death, this work\nremains a significant contribution to democratic theory.\n5. The Place of the State in Spinoza\u2019s Ontology\n\n\nIn recent years a lively discussion has emerged in the scholarly\nliterature concerning whether or not Spinoza\u2019s state is an individual\nwith its own conatus. At issue in this debate is whether Spinoza was\nmore of a collectivist or an individualist. The answer to this\nquestion is thought to carry implications for how we conceive of\nSpinoza\u2019s relationship to the liberal tradition. Some of the strongest\nevidence in support of the conception of the state as an individual\ncomes from the so-called physical digression between IIP13 and IIP14,\nwhere Spinoza directly discusses individuality. In this section,\nSpinoza tells us that an individual is a composite body whose parts\n\u201ccommunicate their motion to each other in a certain fixed\nmanner\u201d (II/100, A2, def, A3). The parts of an individual may be\nreplaced, but the individual will persist, provided that the\n\u201csame ratio of motion and rest\u201d is retained (ibid., L5,\nL4). Moreover, individuals who come together to act in a fixed way\nform larger individuals, terminating ultimately in the\nsupreme-individual: the whole of nature (II/101-102, L7). Elsewhere in\nthe Ethics, when remarking on the benefits of human\nassociations, Spinoza claims that \u201cif\u2026two individuals of\nentirely the same nature are joined to one another, they compose an\nindividual twice as powerful as each one\u201d (IVP18S). Here, once\nagain, Spinoza delineates a picture of composite, higher-order\nindividuals, opening up the possibility of viewing the state itself as\nan individual.\n\n\nAlexandre Matheron\u2019s Individu et Communaut\u00e9 chez\nSpinoza contains perhaps the most influential interpretation of\nSpinoza\u2019s account of individuality (1969, esp. Ch. 3). Matheron\nidentifies political societies as individuals, characterized by their\nown \u201cformal element,\u201d i.e., their own unique ratio of\nmotion and rest (see e.g., p. 42, 58).  Following Matheron, Etienne\nBalibar views the state as a highly composite individual, as an\n\u201cindividual of individuals, having a \u2018body\u2019\nand a \u2018soul\u2019 or mind\u201d (1998, 64), a status that he\ncalls elsewhere \u201ctransindividuality\u201d (1997). Others who\nhave espoused this view include Meinecke (1965) and Blom (2007).\n\n\nThis interpretation has been challenged in a number of ways. One\nargument against the view is that in the opening passages of TTP 17\nSpinoza, in contrast to Hobbes, claims that individuals always retain a\n\u201cconsiderable part\u201d of their own natural right; in other\nwords, human beings are never fully integrated into the\nsuper-individual, or state (Den Uyl 1983, 70). The problem with this\nobjection is that there is no reason to suppose that all individuals\nare characterized by complete integration of parts. Matheron, for\ninstance, describes the state as complex individual whose parts are\nonly integrated to a limited degree (1969, 58). Balibar, too, claims\nthat the \u201cautonomy\u201d of individuals is maintained even when\none is a part of a larger collective whole (1997, 21). It is perfectly\nconsistent to recognize the discrete individuality of humans while\nallowing that, under certain conditions of association, individuals can\nsimultaneously be members of larger units. One can be both\na collectivist and an individualist. The real\nanti-individualists are the idealists, who read Spinoza as maintaining\nthat \u201chuman individuality is illusory and untrue\u201d (Joachim\n1901, 130).\n\n\nA second objection to the view that the state is an individual is\nthat, whereas singular things can only be destroyed by external causes\n(IIIP4), \u201ca commonwealth is always in greater danger from its\ncitizens than from its enemies\u201d (e.g., TP 6/6).  If we assume\nthat all individuals are singular things (for a helpful discussion of\nthe relationship between these concepts, see D. Garrett 1994), then\nthe fact that states can ostensibly be destroyed by their parts (i.e.,\ncitizens) would be a sufficient basis for denying that they are\nindividuals (Barbone and Rice 2000, 26\u20137). This is a forceful\nobjection. However, it seems that an analysis of the apparent\nself-destruction of the commonwealth could be provided that parallels\nSpinoza\u2019s attempt to explain how suicide is possible in light of the\nconatus doctrine (EIVP20S). An apparently self-destructive state could\nbe regarded as one that is so affected by \u201chidden external\ncauses,\u201d so overwhelmed by destructive passions, that it takes\non a new nature that is contrary to its original nature (ibid.).\nSpecifically, Spinoza could explain cases of apparent civil\nself-destruction by maintaining that they occur only at the hands of\npoorly-integrated individuals who stand, at least to some degree,\noutside of the body politic. While this form of explanation is not\nwithout problems (see Bennett 1984, \u00a756), it is not obvious that\nthese problems are peculiar to collectivist interpretations of the\nstate.\n\n\nA third challenge to the collectivist interpretation is that if the\nstate is an individual, it should have a mind of its own. But Steven\nBarbone points out that references to the mind of the state are\ntypically preceded by qualifying phrases like veluti\n(\u201cas it were\u201d) and\nquasi (\u201cas if\u201d), indicating that the state has a\nmind only in a metaphorical sort of way (Barbone 2001, pp. 104\u2013105).\nThis objection might be mitigated by arguing that individuality is\nitself a matter of degree and that states are at best\n\u201cloose\u201d individuals (Della Rocca 1996, Ch. 2), with limited\ncohesion or regularity of action. This is consistent with the claim,\nnoted above, that integration into a larger union is itself a matter of\ndegree.\n\n\nUltimately, it seems to me that far less hinges on the success or\nfailure of the collectivist interpretation than has been assumed by\nits opponents. The primary concern expressed by critics like Den Uyl\nand Barbone seems to be that Spinoza not be understood as treating the\nstate as an individual with its own interests that might trump the\ninterests of its constituents. Isaiah Berlin condemned Spinoza along\nwith other positive liberty theorists precisely because he took\nSpinoza to be reifying the state and putting state interests above\nindividual interests (1969). But even if the state is an individual,\nit does not follow that its interests would supersede the interests of\nits citizens. Certainly from the perspective of a citizen, there is no\nreason why one would have to put the interests of the state above\none\u2019s own interests if these two were genuinely to come into to\nconflict. In short, the collectivist can embrace the normative primacy\nof the individual human being. If this is allowed, the matter of\nwhether the state is a literal or merely metaphorical individual seems\nto matter far less than many scholars have supposed.\n6. The Reception and Influence of Spinoza\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\n\nIn is difficult to assess adequately the scope of influence of\nSpinoza\u2019s political thought. Even where Spinoza\u2019s influence\non subsequent political thinkers is direct and indisputable, it is not\nalways easy to tease out the extent to this influence is due to his own\npolitical philosophy, as opposed to his metaphysics. Further\ncomplicating the assessment is the fact that Spinoza and Spinozism\nremained a bugbear throughout Europe for much of the late\n17th and 18th centuries, during which time\nSpinozism was widely associated with atheism. For this reason, even\nsympathetic philosophers often sought to distance their views\nfrom Spinoza\u2019s, positioning themselves as critics or downplaying\nfamiliarity with his texts. Nevertheless, we find traces of the\ninfluence of Spinoza\u2019s political writings throughout the\nEnlightenment, along with an array of hostile responses.\n\n\nThe publication of the unfinished TP in Spinoza\u2019s posthumous\nOpera was met with relative indifference, upstaged as it was\nby the simultaneous appearance of Ethics (Laerke 2010, 122).\nHowever, the TTP was read, discussed, and condemned in the decades\nfollowing its publication. The critical reception tended to focus on\nthe perceived anti-religious features of the work\u2014for instance,\nthe refutation of miracles and the denial of the divine origin of the\nPentateuch\u2014but the naturalistic account of right and law and the\narguments for the freedom to philosophize also provoked debate.\n\n\nJakob Thomasius, Leibniz\u2019s teacher in Leipzig, composed a\nwork, Adversus Anonymum, de Libertate Philosophandi,\ndevoted entirely to the refutation of the TTP and its underlying\nnaturalism. Leibniz too seems to have regarded Spinoza\u2019s views on\nright and law as more dangerous even than Hobbes\u2019, for while Hobbes at\nleast allowed conceptual space for a divine legislator, Spinoza did\nnot (Laerke 2010, 125). Even relatively liberal natural lawyers like Lambert van Velthuysen\n(1622\u20131685) and Samuel Pufendorf (1632\u20131694), regarded\nSpinoza\u2019s treatment of right and obligation as fundamentally\ndestructive. Velthuysen objects that, without a divine legislator,\nthere is \u201cno room left for precepts and commandments\u201d (Ep.\n42) in Spinoza\u2019s philosophy. And Pufendorf maintains that Spinoza\u2019s\nconception of right is defective in that it fails to produce a\n\u201cmoral effect\u201d or to put others under obligations\n(Pufendorf 1934, 391; see Curley 1995).\n\n\nWhile Spinoza\u2019s views on right and law were generally met with\ncontempt, his views on the freedom to philosophize [libertas\nphilosophandi] provoked a more balanced reaction. The doctrine\nhad its critics (see e.g., Israel 2010, 81\u20132), but it also had\nits admirers, perhaps including some of the most prominent early-modern\ntolerationists. Bayle, Locke, and Toland, for instance, were familiar\nwith Spinoza\u2019s defense and likely found some inspiration in it,\neven while they denied deep acquaintance (Locke) or situated themselves\nas critics (Bayle and Toland). Toland\u2019s use in\nPantheisticon of the same epigram from the opening of\nTacitus\u2019 Histories\u2014\u201crare are the happy times\nwhen we may think what we wish and say what we think [rara\ntemporum felicitas ubi sentire quae velis et quae sentias dicere\nlicet]\u201d\u2013 that Spinoza draws from in the title of TTP,\nCh. 20 indicates an affinity between the two thinkers on matters of\nfreedom of speech and thought (for more on the use of this epigram in\nthe 17th and 18th centuries, see Paul Russell\n2010, Ch. 7),\n\n\nLater enlightenment thinkers reprise Spinoza\u2019s claim that\nwhereas the freedoms of thought and expression should be protected, one\nought to obey the sovereign\u2019s decisions on matters of action (TTP\n20, 251\u20132). Echoes of this view may be found in Moses\nMendelssohn\u2019s separation of action and conviction in\nJerusalem (Mendelssohn 1983, 40; Gottlieb 2011, 50), a work\nfor which one scholar maintains that the TTP \u201cserves, if not as\nmodel, at least as decisive subtext\u201d (Goetschel 2004, 168). This\ndivision was even adopted by Frederick the Great, whose policy that men\nmay argue about whatever they wish, provided that they obey is famously\ncelebrated in Kant\u2019s essay \u201cWhat is Enlightenment?\u201d\n[Was ist Aufkl\u00e4rung?].\n\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning Spinoza\u2019s influence on the\ndemocratic thought of the French Enlightenment. Jonathan Israel has\nexamined the myriad ways in which Spinoza\u2019s philosophy shaped\negalitarian political thought, including, perhaps most significantly,\nthe political thought of the encyclop\u00e9distes (Israel 2011).\nSpinoza\u2019s influence here is primarily due to his naturalism,\nwhich inspired the materialist metaphysics that underpinned French\ndemocratic thought, rather than to his political arguments. And\nSpinoza\u2019s realist and arguably anti-revolutionary political\nmethod suggests that even if Spinoza\u2019s philosophy influenced\nrevolutionary democratic thought, it may have had little to do with his\nactual political philosophy. (For divergent assessments of\nSpinoza\u2019s attitude towards revolution, see Rosenthal 2013 and\nSharp 2013). Nevertheless, one finds more than a whiff of\nSpinoza\u2019s absolutist conception of democracy in the accounts of the general will\n[volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale] found in\nRousseau (see Ekstein 1944; Williams 2010) and Diderot (Israel\n2011).\n\n\nMore recently, Spinoza\u2019s political philosophy has figured\nprominently in post-1968 leftist French political thought (for a\nsurvey, see van Bunge 2012). However, in the United States, few\npolitical philosophers have seriously engaged Spinoza\u2019s work,\neven while scholarly interest has grown. There is reason to hope,\nhowever, that as Spinoza continues to emerge from Hobbes\u2019 shadow,\npolitical philosophers here may begin to appreciate the rich,\nconsistent, and resourceful arguments contained in his political\nwritings.",
