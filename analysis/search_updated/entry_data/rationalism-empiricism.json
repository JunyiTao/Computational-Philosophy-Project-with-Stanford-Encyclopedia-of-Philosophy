    "preamble": "\n\nIn its most general terms, the dispute between rationalism and\nempiricism has been taken to concern the extent to which we are\ndependent upon experience in our effort to gain knowledge of the\nexternal world. It is common to think of experience itself as being of\ntwo kinds: sense experience, involving our five world-oriented senses,\nand reflective experience, including conscious awareness of our mental\noperations. The distinction between the two is drawn primarily by\nreference to their objects: sense experience allows us to acquire\nknowledge of external objects, whereas our awareness of our mental\noperations is responsible for the acquisition of knowledge of our\nminds. In the dispute between rationalism and empiricism, this\ndistinction is often neglected; rationalist critiques of empiricism\nusually contend that the latter claims that all our ideas originate\nwith sense experience.\n\nIt is generally agreed that most rationalists claim that there are\nsignificant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained\nindependently of sense experience. To be a rationalist, however, does\nnot require one to claim that our knowledge is acquired independently\nof any experience: at its core, the Cartesian Cogito\ndepends on our reflective, intuitive awareness of the existence of\noccurrent thought. Rationalists generally develop their view in two\nsteps. First, they argue that there are cases where the content of our\nconcepts or knowledge outstrips the information that sense experience\ncan provide. Second, they construct accounts of how reason, in some\nform or other, provides that additional information about the external\nworld.\n\nMost empiricists present complementary lines of thought. First, they\ndevelop accounts of how experience alone -- sense experience,\nreflective experience, or a combination of the two -- provides the\ninformation that rationalists cite, insofar as we have it in the first\nplace. Second, while empiricists attack the rationalists\u2019\naccounts of how reason is a primary source of concepts or knowledge,\nthey show that reflective understanding can and usually does supply\nsome of the missing links (famously, Locke believed that our idea of\nsubstance, in general, is a composite idea, incorporating elements\nderived from both sensation and reflection, e.g. Essay,\n2.23.2).\n\nThe distinction between rationalism and empiricism is not without\nproblems. One of the main issues is that almost no author falls neatly\ninto one camp or another: it has been argued that Descartes, for\ninstance, who is commonly regarded as a representative rationalist (at\nleast with regard to metaphysics), had clear empiricist leanings\n(primarily with regard to natural philosophy, where sense experience\nplays a crucial role, according to Clarke 1982). Conversely, Locke,\nwho is thought to be a paradigmatic empiricist, argued that reason is\non equal footing with experience, when it comes to the knowledge of\ncertain things, most famously of moral truths (Essay,\n4.3.18). In what follows, we clarify what this distinction has\ntraditionally been taken to apply to, as well as point out its (by\nnow) widely-recognized shortcomings.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nThe dispute between rationalism and empiricism takes place primarily\nwithin epistemology, the branch of philosophy devoted to studying the\nnature, sources, and limits of knowledge. Knowledge itself can be of\nmany different things and is usually divided among three main\ncategories: knowledge of the external world, knowledge of the internal\nworld or self-knowledge, and knowledge of moral and/or aesthetical\nvalues. We may find that there are category-specific conditions that\nmust be satisfied for knowledge to occur and that it is easier or more\ndifficult to shape certain questions and answers, depending on whether\nwe focus on the external world or on the values. However, some of the\ndefining questions of general epistemology include the following.\n\nWhat is the nature of propositional knowledge, knowledge that a\nparticular proposition about the world, ourselves, morality, or beauty\nis true?\n\nTo know a proposition, we must believe it and it must be true, but\nsomething more is required, something that distinguishes knowledge\nfrom a lucky guess. Let\u2019s call this additional element\n\u2018warrant\u2019. A good deal of philosophical work has been\ninvested in trying to determine the nature of warrant. \nHow can we gain knowledge?\n\nWe can form true beliefs just by making lucky guesses. How to gain\nwarranted beliefs is less clear. Moreover, to know the external world\nor anything about beauty, for instance, we must be able to think about\nthe external world or about beauty, and it is unclear how we gain the\nconcepts we use in thought or what assurance, if any, we have that the\nways in which we divide up the world using our concepts correspond to\ndivisions that actually exist. \nWhat are the limits of our knowledge?\n\nSome aspects of the external world, ourselves, or the moral and\naesthetical values may be within the limits of our thought but beyond\nthe limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions of\nthem, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the\nexternal world, ourselves, or the moral and aesthetical values may\neven be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form\nintelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular\ndescription is true. \n\n\nThe disagreement between rationalism and empiricism primarily concerns\nthe second question, regarding the sources of our concepts and\nknowledge. In some instances, the disagreement on this topic results\nin conflicting responses to the other questions as well. The\ndisagreement may extend to incorporate the nature of warrant or where\nthe limits of our thought and knowledge are. Our focus here will be on\nthe competing rationalist and empiricist responses to the second\nquestion.\n\nThere are three main theses that are usually seen as relevant for\ndrawing the distinction between rationalism and empiricism, with a\nfocus on the second question. While the first thesis has been\ntraditionally seen as distinguishing between rationalism and\nempiricism, scholars now mostly agree that most rationalists and\nempiricists abide by the so-called Intuition/Deduction\nthesis, concerning the ways in which we become warranted in\nbelieving propositions in a particular subject area.\n\nThe Intuition/Deduction Thesis: Some propositions in a\nparticular subject area, S, are knowable by us by intuition alone;\nstill others are knowable by being deduced from intuited propositions.\n\n\nIntuition is a form of direct, immediate insight. Intuition has been\nlikened to (a sort of internal) perception by most rationalists and\nempiricists alike. Intellectually grasping a proposition, we just\n\u201csee\u201d it to be true in such a way as to form a true,\nwarranted belief in it. (As discussed in Section 2 below, the nature\nof this intellectual \u201cseeing\u201d needs explanation.)\nDeduction is a process in which we derive conclusions from intuited\npremises through valid arguments, ones in which the conclusion must be\ntrue if the premises are true. We intuit, for example, that the number\nthree is prime and that it is greater than two. We then deduce from\nthis knowledge that there is a prime number greater than two.\nIntuition and deduction thus provide us with knowledge that is\nindependent, for its justification, of experience. This type of\nknowledge, since Kant, is commonly called \u201ca\npriori\u201d.\n\nWe can generate different versions of the Intuition/Deduction thesis\nby substituting different subject areas for the variable\n\u2018S\u2019. Several rationalists and empiricists take mathematics\nto be knowable by intuition and deduction. Some place ethical truths\nin this category. Some include metaphysical claims, such as that God\nexists, we have free will, and our mind and body are distinct\nsubstances.\n\nThe second thesis that is relevant to the distinction between\nrationalism and empiricism is the Innate Knowledge\nthesis.\n\nThe Innate Knowledge Thesis: We have knowledge of some truths\nin a particular subject area, S, as part of our nature.\n\n\nThe Innate Knowledge thesis asserts the existence of knowledge whose\nsource is our own nature: we are born with this knowledge; it\ndoesn\u2019t depend, for its justification, on our accessing it via\nparticular experiences. Our innate knowledge is not learned through\neither experience or intuition/deduction. It is just part of our\nnature. Experiences may trigger a process by which we bring this\nknowledge to consciousness, but these experiences do not provide us\nwith the knowledge itself. It has in some way been with us all along.\nAccording to some rationalists, we gained the knowledge in an earlier\nexistence. According to others, God provided us with it at creation.\nStill others say it is part of our nature through natural\nselection.\n\nWe get different versions of the Innate Knowledge thesis by\nsubstituting different subject areas for the variable \u2018S\u2019.\nThe more subjects included within the range of the thesis or the more\ncontroversial the claim to have knowledge in them, the more radical\nthe form of rationalism. Stronger and weaker understandings of warrant\nyield stronger and weaker versions of the thesis as well. Empiricists\nreject this thesis: Locke, for instance, dedicates the whole first\nbook of the Essay to show that such knowledge, even if it\nexisted, would be of little use to us.\n\nThe third important thesis that is relevant to the distinction between\nrationalism and empiricism is the Innate Concept thesis.\n\nThe Innate Concept Thesis: We have some of the concepts we\nemploy in a particular subject area, S, as part of our rational\nnature.\n\n\nAccording to the Innate Concept thesis, some of our concepts are not\ngained from experience. They are part of our rational nature in such a\nway that, while sense experiences may trigger a process by which they\nare brought to consciousness, experience does not provide the concepts\nor determine the information they contain. Some claim that the Innate\nConcept thesis is entailed by the Innate Knowledge Thesis; a\nparticular instance of knowledge can only be innate if the concepts\nthat are contained in the known proposition are also innate. This is\nLocke\u2019s position (Essay, 1.4.1). Others, such as\nCarruthers, argue against this connection (1992, pp. 53\u201354). The\ncontent and strength of the Innate Concept thesis varies with the\nconcepts claimed to be innate. The more a concept seems removed from\nexperience and the mental operations we can perform on experience the\nmore plausibly it may be claimed to be innate. Since we do not\nexperience perfect triangles but do experience pains, our concept of\nthe former is a more promising candidate for being innate than our\nconcept of the latter.\n1.1 Rationalism\n\nThe Intuition/Deduction thesis, the Innate Knowledge thesis, and the\nInnate Concept thesis are essential to rationalism. Since the\nIntuition/Deduction thesis is equally important to empiricism, the\nfocus in what follows will be on the other two theses. To be a\nrationalist is to adopt at least one of them: either the Innate\nKnowledge thesis, regarding our presumed propositional innate\nknowledge, or the Innate Concept thesis, regarding our supposed innate\nknowledge of concepts.\n\nRationalists vary the strength of their view by adjusting their\nunderstanding of warrant. Some take warranted beliefs to be beyond\neven the slightest doubt and claim that intuition provide beliefs of\nthis high epistemic status. Others interpret warrant more\nconservatively, say as belief beyond a reasonable doubt, and claim\nthat intuition provide beliefs of that caliber. Still another\ndimension of rationalism depends on how its proponents understand the\nconnection between intuition, on the one hand, and truth, on the\nother. Some take intuition to be infallible, claiming that whatever we\nintuit must be true. Others allow for the possibility of false\nintuited propositions.\n\nTwo other closely related theses are generally adopted by\nrationalists, although one can certainly be a rationalist without\nadopting either of them. The first is that sense experience cannot\nprovide what we gain from reason.\n\nThe Indispensability of Reason Thesis: The knowledge we gain\nin subject area, S, by intuition and deduction, as well as the ideas\nand instances of knowledge in S that are innate to us, could not have\nbeen gained by us through sense experience.\n\n\nThe second is that reason is superior to sense experience as a source\nof knowledge.\n\nThe Superiority of Reason Thesis: The knowledge we gain in\nsubject area S by intuition and deduction or have innately is superior\nto any knowledge gained by sense experience.\n\n\nHow reason is superior needs explanation, and rationalists have\noffered different accounts. One view, generally associated with\nDescartes (Rules, Rule II and Rule III, pp. 1\u20134), is\nthat what we know by intuition is certain, beyond even the\nslightest doubt, while what we believe, or even know, on the basis of\nsense experience is at least somewhat uncertain. Another view,\ngenerally associated with Plato (Republic 479e-484c), locates\nthe superiority of a priori knowledge in the objects known.\nWhat we know by reason alone, a Platonic form, say, is superior in an\nimportant metaphysical way, e.g. unchanging, eternal, perfect, a\nhigher degree of being, to what we are aware of through sense\nexperience.\n\nMost forms of rationalism involve notable commitments to other\nphilosophical positions. One is a commitment to the denial of\nscepticism for at least some area of knowledge. If we claim to know\nsome truths by intuition or deduction or to have some innate\nknowledge, we obviously reject scepticism with regard to those truths.\nRationalism in the form of the Intuition/Deduction thesis is also\ncommitted to epistemic foundationalism, the view that we know some\ntruths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we\nthen use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.\n1.2 Empiricism\n\nEmpiricists also endorse the Intuition/Deduction thesis, but in a more\nrestricted sense than the rationalists: this thesis applies only to\nrelations of the contents of our minds, not also about empirical\nfacts, learned from the external world.  By contrast, empiricists\nreject the Innate Knowledge and Innate Concept theses. Insofar as we\nhave knowledge in a subject, our knowledge is gained, not\nonly triggered, by our experiences, be they sensorial or\nreflective. Experience is, thus, our only source of ideas. Moreover,\nthey reject the corresponding version of the Superiority of Reason\nthesis. Since reason alone does not give us any knowledge, it\ncertainly does not give us superior knowledge.  Empiricists need not\nreject the Indispensability of Reason thesis, but most of them do.\n\nThe main characteristic of empiricism, however, is that it endorses a\nversion of the following claim for some subject area:\n\nThe Empiricism Thesis: We have no source of knowledge in S or\nfor the concepts we use in S other than experience.\n\n\nTo be clear, the Empiricism thesis does not entail that we have\nempirical knowledge. It entails that knowledge can only be gained,\nif at all, by experience. Empiricists may assert, as some do\nfor some subjects, that the rationalists are correct to claim that\nexperience cannot give us knowledge. The conclusion they draw from\nthis rationalist lesson is that we do not know at all. This is,\nindeed, Hume's position with regard to causation, which, he argues, is\nnot actually known, but only presupposed to be holding true, in virtue\nof a particular habit of our minds.\n\nWe have stated the basic claims of rationalism and empiricism so that\neach is relative to a particular subject area. Rationalism and\nempiricism, so relativized, need not conflict. We can be rationalists\nin mathematics or a particular area of mathematics and empiricists in\nall or some of the physical sciences. Rationalism and empiricism only\nconflict when formulated to cover the same subject. Then the debate,\nRationalism vs. Empiricism, is joined. The fact that philosophers can\nbe both rationalists and empiricists has implications for the\nclassification schemes often employed in the history of philosophy,\nespecially the one traditionally used to describe the Early Modern\nPeriod of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries leading up to Kant.\nIt is standard practice to group the philosophers of this period as\neither rationalists or empiricists and to suggest that those under one\nheading share a common agenda in opposition to those under the other.\nThus, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are the Continental Rationalists\nin opposition to Locke, Hume, and Reid, the British Empiricists. Such\ngeneral classification schemes should only be adopted with great\ncaution. The views of the individual philosophers are a lot more\nsubtle and complex than the simple-minded classification suggests.\n(See Loeb (1981) and Kenny (1986) for important discussions of this\npoint.) Locke rejects rationalism in the form of any version of the\nInnate Knowledge or Innate Concept theses, but he nonetheless adopts\nthe Intuition/Deduction thesis with regard to our knowledge of\nGod\u2019s existence, in addition to our knowledge of mathematics and\nmorality. Descartes and Locke have remarkably similar views on the\nnature of our ideas, even though Descartes takes many to be innate,\nwhile Locke ties them all to experience. The rationalist/empiricist\nclassification also encourages us to expect the philosophers on each\nside of the divide to have common research programs in areas beyond\nepistemology. Thus, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are mistakenly seen\nas applying a reason-centered epistemology to a common metaphysical\nagenda, with each trying to improve on the efforts of the one before,\nwhile Locke, Hume, and Reid are mistakenly seen as gradually rejecting\nthose metaphysical claims, with each consciously trying to improve on\nthe efforts of his predecessors. It is also important to note that the\nrationalist/empiricist distinction is not exhaustive of the possible\nsources of knowledge. One might claim, for example, that we can gain\nknowledge in a particular area by a form of Divine revelation or\ninsight that is a product of neither reason nor sense experience. In\nshort, when used carelessly, the labels \u2018rationalist\u2019 and\n\u2018empiricist,\u2019 as well as the slogan that is the title of\nthis essay, \u2018Rationalism vs. Empiricism,\u2019 can impede\nrather than advance our understanding.\n\nAn important wrinkle for using this classification scheme in the\nhistory of philosophy is that it leaves out discussions of\nphilosophical figures who did not focus their efforts on understanding\nwhether innate knowledge is possible or even fruitful to have.\nPhilosophy in the early modern period, in particular, is a lot richer\nthan this artificial, simplifying distinction makes it sound. There is\nno clear way of grouping Hobbes with either camp, let alone Elizabeth\nof Bohemia, Anne Conway, George Berkeley, \u00c9milie du\nCh\u00e2telet, or Mary Shepherd. This distinction, initially applied\nby Kant, is responsible for giving us a very restrictive philosophical\ncanon, which does not take into account developments in the philosophy\nof emotions, philosophy of education, and even disputes in areas of\nphilosophy considered more mainstream, like ethics and aesthetics.\n\nUnless restricted to debates regarding the possibility of innate\nknowledge, this distinction is best left unused. The most interesting\nform of the debate occurs when we take the relevant subject to be\ntruths about the external world, the world beyond our own minds. A\nfull-fledged rationalist with regard to our knowledge of the external\nworld holds that some external world truths are and must be innate and\nthat this knowledge is superior to any that sense experience could\never provide. The full-fledged empiricist about our knowledge of the\nexternal world replies that, when it comes to the nature of the world\nbeyond our own minds, experience is our sole source of information.\nReason might inform us of the relations among our ideas, but those\nideas themselves can only be gained, and any truths about the external\nreality they represent can only be known, on the basis of experience.\nThis debate concerning our knowledge of the external world will\ngenerally be our main focus in what follows.\n\nHistorically, the rationalist/empiricist dispute in epistemology has\nextended into the area of metaphysics, where philosophers are\nconcerned with the basic nature of reality, including the existence of\nGod and such aspects of our nature as free-will and the relation\nbetween the mind and body. Several rationalists (e.g., Descartes,\nMeditations) have presented metaphysical theories, which they\nhave claimed to know by intuition and/or deduction alone. Empiricists\n(e.g., Hume, Treatise) have rejected the theories as either\nspeculation, beyond what we can learn from experience, or nonsensical\nattempts to describe aspects of the world beyond the concepts\nexperience can provide. The debate raises the issue of metaphysics as\nan area of knowledge. Kant puts the driving assumption clearly:\n\nThe very concept of metaphysics ensures that the sources of\nmetaphysics can\u2019t be empirical. If something could be known\nthrough the senses, that would automatically show that it\ndoesn\u2019t belong to metaphysics; that\u2019s an upshot of the\nmeaning of the word \u2018metaphysics.\u2019 Its basic principles\ncan never be taken from experience, nor can its basic concepts; for it\nis not to be physical but metaphysical knowledge, so it must be beyond\nexperience. (Prolegomena, Preamble, I, p. 7)\n\n\nThe possibility then of metaphysics so understood, as an area of human\nknowledge, hinges on how we resolve the rationalist/empiricist debate.\nThe debate also extends into ethics. Some moral objectivists (e.g.,\nRoss 1930 and Huemer 2005) take us to know some fundamental objective\nmoral truths by intuition, while some moral skeptics, who reject such\nknowledge (e.g., Mackie 1977), find the appeal to a faculty of moral\nintuition utterly implausible. More recently, the\nrationalist/empiricist debate has extended to discussions (e.g.,\nBealer 1999 and Alexander & Weinberg 2007) of the very nature of\nphilosophical inquiry: to what extent are philosophical questions to\nbe answered by appeals to reason or experience?\n2. The Intuition/Deduction Thesis\n\nThe Intuition/Deduction thesis claims that we can know some\npropositions by intuition and still more by deduction. Since\ntraditionally this thesis was thought to be rejected by empiricists\nand adopted only by rationalists, it is useful to become more familiar\nwith it. In a very narrow sense, only rationalists seem to adopt it.\nHowever, the current consensus is that most empiricists (e.g., Locke,\nHume, Reid) have been willing to accept a version of the thesis,\nnamely inasmuch as it is restricted to propositions solely about the\nrelations among our own concepts. We can, they agree, know by\nintuition that our concept of God includes our concept of omniscience.\nJust by examining the concepts, we can intellectually grasp that the\none includes the other. The debate between rationalists and\nempiricists is joined when the former assert, and the latter deny, the\nIntuition/Deduction thesis with regard to propositions that contain\nsubstantive information about the external world. Rationalists, such\nas Descartes, have claimed that we can know by intuition and deduction\nthat God exists and created the world, that our mind and body are\ndistinct substances, and that the angles of a triangle equal two right\nangles, where all of these claims are truths about an external reality\nindependent of our thought. Such substantive versions of the\nIntuition/Deduction thesis are our concern in this section.\n\nOne defense of the Intuition/Deduction thesis assumes that we know\nsome substantive external world truths, adds an analysis of what\nknowledge requires, and concludes that our knowledge must result from\nintuition and deduction. Rationalists and empiricists alike claim that\ncertainty is required for scientia (which is a type of\nabsolute knowledge of the necessary connections that would explain why\ncertain things are a certain way) and that certainty about the\nexternal world is beyond what empirical evidence can provide.\nEmpiricists seem happy to then conclude that the type of knowledge of\nthe external world that we can acquire does not have this high degree\nof certainty and is, thus, not scientia. This is because we\ncan never be sure our sensory impressions are not part of a dream or a\nmassive, demon orchestrated, deception. A rationalist like Descartes\nof the Meditations, claims that only intuition can provide\nthe certainty needed for such knowledge. This, after his arguing in\nthe Rules that, when we \u201creview all the actions of the\nintellect by means of which we are able to arrive at a knowledge of\nthings with no fear of being mistaken,\u201d we \u201crecognize only\ntwo: intuition and deduction\u201d (Rules, Rule III,\np. 3).\n\nThis line of argument is one of the least compelling in the\nrationalist arsenal. First, the assumption that knowledge requires\ncertainty comes at a heavy cost, as it rules out so much of what we\ncommonly take ourselves to know. Second, as many contemporary\nrationalists accept, intuition is not always a source of certain\nknowledge. The possibility of a deceiver gives us a reason to doubt\nour intuitions as well as our empirical beliefs. For all we know, a\ndeceiver might cause us to intuit false propositions, just as one\nmight cause us to have perceptions of nonexistent objects.\nDescartes\u2019s classic way of meeting this challenge in the\nMeditations is to argue that we can know with certainty that\nno such deceiver interferes with our intuitions and deductions. They\nare infallible, as God guarantees their truth. The problem, known as\nthe Cartesian Circle, is that Descartes\u2019s account of how we gain\nthis knowledge begs the question, by attempting to deduce the\nconclusion that all our intuitions are true from intuited premises.\nMoreover, his account does not touch a remaining problem that he\nhimself notes (Rules, Rule VII, p. 7): Deductions of any\nappreciable length rely on our fallible memory.\n\nA more plausible argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis again\nassumes that we know some particular, external world truths, and then\nappeals to the nature of what we know, rather than to the nature of\nknowledge itself, to argue that our knowledge must result from\nintuition and deduction. Leibniz, in New Essays, tells us the\nfollowing:\n\nThe senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge,\nare not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never\ngive anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual\ntruths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however\nnumerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal\nnecessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what\nhappened before will happen in the same way again. \u2026 From which\nit appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics,\nand particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles\nwhose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the\ntestimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never\nhave occurred to us to think of them\u2026 (New Essays,\nPreface, pp. 150\u2013151)\n\n\nLeibniz goes on to describe our mathematical knowledge as\n\u201cinnate,\u201d and his argument is more commonly directed to\nsupport the Innate Knowledge thesis rather than the\nIntuition/Deduction thesis. For our purposes here, we can relate it to\nthe latter, however: We have substantive knowledge about the external\nworld in mathematics, and what we know in that area, we know to be\nnecessarily true. Experience cannot warrant beliefs about what is\nnecessarily the case. Hence, experience cannot be the source of our\nknowledge. The best explanation of our knowledge is that we gain it by\nintuition and deduction. Leibniz mentions logic, metaphysics, and\nmorals as other areas in which our knowledge similarly outstrips what\nexperience can provide. Judgments in logic and metaphysics involve\nforms of necessity beyond what experience can support. Judgments in\nmorals involve a form of obligation or value that lies beyond\nexperience, which only informs us about what is the case rather than\nabout what ought to be.\n\nThe strength of this argument varies with its examples of purported\nknowledge. Insofar as we focus on controversial claims in metaphysics,\ne.g., that God exists, that our mind is a distinct substance from our\nbody, the initial premise that we know the claims is less than\ncompelling. Taken with regard to other areas, however, the argument\nclearly has legs. We know a great deal of mathematics, and what we\nknow, we know to be necessarily true. None of our experiences warrants\na belief in such necessity, and we do not seem to base our knowledge\non any experiences. The warrant that provides us with knowledge arises\nfrom an intellectual grasp of the propositions which is clearly part\nof our learning. Similarly, we seem to have such moral knowledge as\nthat, all other things being equal, it is wrong to break a promise and\nthat pleasure is intrinsically good. No empirical lesson about how\nthings are can warrant such knowledge of how they ought to be.\n\nThis argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis raises additional\nquestions which rationalists must answer. Insofar as they maintain\nthat our knowledge of necessary truths in mathematics or elsewhere by\nintuition and deduction is substantive knowledge of the external\nworld, they owe us an account of this form of necessity. Many\nempiricists stand ready to argue that \u201cnecessity resides in the\nway we talk about things, not in the things we talk about\u201d\n(Quine 1966, p. 174). Similarly, if rationalists claim that our\nknowledge in morals is knowledge of an objective form of obligation,\nthey owe us an account of how objective values are part of a world of\napparently valueless facts.\n\nPerhaps most of all, any defenders of the Intuition/Deduction thesis\nowe us an account of what intuition is and how it provides warranted\ntrue beliefs about the external world. What is it to intuit a\nproposition and how does that act of intuition support a warranted\nbelief? Their argument presents intuition and deduction as an\nexplanation of assumed knowledge that can\u2019t\u2014they\nsay\u2014be explained by experience, but such an explanation by\nintuition and deduction requires that we have a clear understanding of\nintuition and how it supports warranted beliefs. Metaphorical\ncharacterizations of intuition as intellectual \u201cgrasping\u201d\nor \u201cseeing\u201d are not enough, and if intuition is some form\nof intellectual \u201cgrasping,\u201d it appears that all that is\ngrasped is relations among our concepts, rather than facts about the\nexternal world, as the empiricists defenders of intuition and\ndeduction argue. One current approach to the issue involves an appeal\nto Phenomenal Conservatism (Huemer 2001), the principle that if it\nseems to one as if something is the case, then one is prima facie\njustified in believing that it is so. Intuitions are then taken to be\na particular sort of seeming or appearance: \u201c[A]n intuition that\np is a state of its seeming to one that p that is not dependent on\ninference from other beliefs and that results from thinking about p,\nas opposed to perceiving, remembering, or introspecting\u201d (Huemer\n2005, p. 102). Just as it can visually seem or appear to one as if\nthere\u2019s a tree outside the window, it can intellectually seem or\nappear to one as if nothing can be both entirely red and entirely\ngreen. This approach aims to demystify intuitions; they are but one\nmore form of seeming-state along with ones we gain from sense\nperception, memory, and introspection. It does not, however, tell us\nall we need to know. Any intellectual faculty, whether it be sense\nperception, memory, introspection or intuition, provides us with\nwarranted beliefs only if it is generally reliable. The reliability of\nsense perception stems from the causal connection between how external\nobjects are and how we experience them. What accounts for the\nreliability of our intuitions regarding the external world? Is our\nintuition of a particular true proposition the outcome of some causal\ninteraction between ourselves and some aspect of the world? What\naspect? What is the nature of this causal interaction? That the number\nthree is prime does not appear to cause anything, let alone our\nintuition that it is prime. As Michael Huemer (2005, p. 123) points\nout in mounting his own defense of moral intuitionism, \u201cThe\nchallenge for the moral realist, then, is to explain how it would be\nanything more than chance if my moral beliefs were true, given that I\ndo not interact with moral properties.\u201d\n\nThese issues are made all the more pressing by the classic empiricist\nresponse to the argument. The reply is generally credited to Hume and\nbegins with a division of all true propositions into two\ncategories.\n\nAll the objects of human reason or inquiry may naturally be divided\ninto two kinds, to wit, \u201cRelations of Ideas,\u201d and\n\u201cMatters of Fact.\u201d Of the first are the sciences of\nGeometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic, and, in short, every affirmation\nwhich is either intuitively or demonstratively certain. That the\nsquare of the hypotenuse is equal to the square of the two sides is a\nproposition which expresses a relation between these figures. That\nthree times five is equal to half of thirty expresses a relation\nbetween these numbers. Propositions of this kind are discoverable by\nthe mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere\nexistent in the universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle\nin nature, the truths demonstrated by Euclid would forever retain\ntheir certainty and evidence. Matters of fact, which are the second\nobjects of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner, nor\nis our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with\nthe foregoing. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible,\nbecause it can never imply a contradiction and is conceived by the\nmind with the same facility and distinctness as if ever so conformable\nto reality. (Enquiry, 4.1, p. 24)\n\n\nIntuition and deduction can provide us with knowledge of necessary\ntruths such as those found in mathematics and logic, but such\nknowledge is not substantive knowledge of the external world. It is\nonly knowledge of the relations of our own ideas. If the rationalist\nshifts the argument so it appeals to knowledge in morals, Hume\u2019s\nreply is to offer an analysis of our moral concepts by which such\nknowledge is empirically gained knowledge of matters of fact.\n\nMorals and criticism are not so properly objects of the understanding\nas of taste and sentiment. Beauty, whether moral or natural, is felt\nmore properly than perceived. Or if we reason concerning it and\nendeavor to fix the standard, we regard a new fact, to wit, the\ngeneral taste of mankind, or some other fact which may be the object\nof reasoning and inquiry. (Enquiry, 12.3, p. 122)\n\n\nIf the rationalist appeals to our knowledge in metaphysics to support\nthe argument, Hume denies that we have such knowledge.\n\nIf we take in our hand any volume--of divinity or school metaphysics,\nfor instance--let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning\nconcerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental\nreasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then\nto the flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.\n(Enquiry, 12.3, p. 123)\n\n\nAn updated version of this general empiricist reply, with an increased\nemphasis on language and the nature of meaning, is given in the\ntwentieth-century by A. J. Ayer\u2019s version of logical positivism.\nAdopting positivism\u2019s verification theory of meaning, Ayer\nassigns every cognitively meaningful sentence to one of two\ncategories: either it is a tautology, and so true solely by virtue of\nthe meaning of its terms and provides no substantive information about\nthe world, or it is open to empirical verification. There is, then, no\nroom for knowledge about the external world by intuition or\ndeduction.\n\nThere can be no a priori knowledge of reality. For \u2026\nthe truths of pure reason, the propositions which we know to be valid\nindependently of all experience, are so only in virtue of their lack\nof factual content \u2026 [By contrast] empirical propositions are\none and all hypotheses which may be confirmed or discredited in actual\nsense experience. (Ayer 1952, pp. 86; 93\u201394)\n\n\nThe rationalists\u2019 argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis\ngoes wrong at the start, according to empiricists, by assuming that we\ncan have substantive knowledge of the external world that outstrips\nwhat experience can warrant. We cannot.\n\nThis empiricist reply faces challenges of its own. Our knowledge of\nmathematics seems to be about something more than our own concepts.\nOur knowledge of moral judgments seems to concern not just how we feel\nor act but how we ought to behave. The general principles that provide\na basis for the empiricist view, e.g. Hume\u2019s overall account of\nour ideas, the Verification Principle of Meaning, are problematic in\ntheir own right.\n\nIn all, rationalists have an argument for the Intuition/Deduction\nthesis relative to our substantive knowledge of the external world,\nbut its success rests on how well they can answer questions about the\nnature and epistemic force of intuition made all the more pressing by\nthe classic empiricist reply.\n3. The Innate Knowledge Thesis\n\nThe Innate Knowledge thesis asserts that we have a priori\nknowledge, that is knowledge independent, for its justification, of\nsense experience, as part of our rational nature. Experience may\ntrigger our awareness of this knowledge, but it does not provide us\nwith it. The knowledge is already there.\n\nPlato presents an early version of the Innate Knowledge thesis in the\nMeno as the doctrine of knowledge by recollection. The\ndoctrine is motivated in part by a paradox that arises when we attempt\nto explain the nature of inquiry. How do we gain knowledge of a\ntheorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by\ninquiry seems impossible (Meno, 80d-e). We either already\nknow the theorem at the start of our investigation or we do not. If we\nalready have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack\nthe knowledge, we don\u2019t know what we are seeking and cannot\nrecognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of\nthe theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems.\n\nThe doctrine of knowledge by recollection offers a solution. When we\ninquire into the truth of a theorem, we both do and do not already\nknow it. We have knowledge in the form of a memory gained from our\nsoul\u2019s knowledge of the theorem prior to its union with our\nbody. We also lack some knowledge because, in our soul\u2019s\nunification with the body, it has forgotten the knowledge and now\nneeds to recollect it. Thus, learning the theorem allows us, in\neffect, to recall what we already know.\n\nPlato famously illustrates the doctrine with an exchange between\nSocrates and a young slave, in which Socrates guides the slave from\nignorance to mathematical knowledge. The slave\u2019s experiences, in\nthe form of Socrates\u2019 questions and illustrations, are the\noccasion for his recollection of what he learned previously.\nPlato\u2019s metaphysics provides additional support for the Innate\nKnowledge Thesis. Since our knowledge is of abstract, eternal Forms,\nwhich clearly lie beyond our sensory experience, it is independent,\nfor its justification, of experience.\n\nContemporary supporters of Plato\u2019s position are scarce. The\ninitial paradox, which Plato describes as a \u201ctrick\nargument\u201d (Meno, 80e), rings sophistical. The\nmetaphysical assumptions in the solution need justification. The\nsolution does not answer the basic question: Just how did the\nslave\u2019s soul learn the theorem? The Intuition/Deduction thesis\noffers an equally, if not more, plausible account of how the slave\ngains this type of knowledge that is independent of experience.\nNonetheless, Plato\u2019s position illustrates the kind of reasoning\nthat has caused many philosophers to adopt some form of the Innate\nKnowledge thesis. We are confident that we know certain propositions\nabout the external world, but there seems to be no adequate\nexplanation of how we gained this knowledge short of saying that it is\ninnate. Its content is beyond what we directly gain in experience, as\nwell as what we can gain by performing mental operations on what\nexperience provides. It does not seem to be based on an intuition or\ndeduction. That it is innate in us appears to be the best\nexplanation.\n\nNoam Chomsky argues along similar lines in presenting what he\ndescribes as a \u201crationalist conception of the nature of\nlanguage\u201d (1975, p. 129). Chomsky argues that the experiences\navailable to language learners are far too sparse to account for their\nknowledge of their language. To explain language acquisition, we must\nassume that learners have an innate knowledge of a universal grammar\ncapturing the common deep structure of natural languages. It is\nimportant to note that Chomsky\u2019s language learners do not know\nparticular propositions describing a universal grammar. They have a\nset of innate capacities or dispositions which enable and determine\ntheir language development. Chomsky gives us a theory of innate\nlearning capacities or structures rather than a theory of innate\nknowledge. His view does not support the Innate Knowledge thesis as\nrationalists have traditionally understood it. As one commentator puts\nit, \u201cChomsky\u2019s principles \u2026 are innate neither in\nthe sense that we are explicitly aware of them, nor in the sense that\nwe have a disposition to recognize their truth as obvious under\nappropriate circumstances. And hence it is by no means clear that\nChomsky is correct in seeing his theory as following the traditional\nrationalist account of the acquisition of knowledge\u201d (Cottingham\n1984, p. 124). Indeed, such a theory, which places nativism at the\nlevel of mental capacities or structures enabling us to acquire\ncertain types of knowledge rather than at the level of knowledge we\nalready posses, is akin to an empiricist take on the issue. Locke and\nReid, for instance, believe that the human mind is endowed with\ncertain abilities that, when developed in the usual course of nature,\nwill lead us to acquire useful knowledge of the external world. The\nmain idea is that it is part of our biology to have a digestive system\nthat, when fed the right kind of food, allows us to process the\nrequired nutrients to enable us to continue to live for a while.\nSimilarly, it is part of our biology to have a mental architecture\nthat, when fed the right kind of information and experiences, allows\nus to process that information and transform it into knowledge. The\nknowledge itself is no more innate than the processed nutrients are.\nOn a view like this, no knowledge is innate; however, we are born with\ncertain capabilities and disposition that enable us to acquire\nknowledge, just as we are equipped with certain organs that allow our\nbodies to function well while we\u2019re alive.\n\nPeter Carruthers (1992) argues that we have innate knowledge of the\nprinciples of folk-psychology. Folk-psychology is a network of\ncommon-sense generalizations that hold independently of context or\nculture and concern the relationships of mental states to one another,\nto the environment and states of the body and to behavior (1992, p.\n115). It includes such beliefs as that pains tend to be caused by\ninjury, that pains tend to prevent us from concentrating on tasks, and\nthat perceptions are generally caused by the appropriate state of the\nenvironment. Carruthers notes the complexity of folk-psychology, along\nwith its success in explaining our behavior and the fact that its\nexplanations appeal to such unobservables as beliefs, desires,\nfeelings, and thoughts. He argues that the complexity, universality,\nand depth of folk-psychological principles outstrips what experience\ncan provide, especially to young children who by their fifth year\nalready know a great many of them. This knowledge is also not the\nresult of intuition or deduction; folk-psychological generalizations\nare not seen to be true in an act of intellectual insight. Carruthers\nconcludes, \u201c[The problem] concerning the child\u2019s\nacquisition of psychological generalizations cannot be solved, unless\nwe suppose that much of folk-psychology is already innate, triggered\nlocally by the child\u2019s experience of itself and others, rather\nthan learned\u201d (1992, p. 121).\n\nEmpiricists, and some rationalists, attack the Innate Knowledge thesis\nin two main ways. First, they offer accounts of how sense experience\nor intuition and deduction provide the knowledge that is claimed to be\ninnate. Second, they directly criticize the Innate Knowledge thesis\nitself. The classic statement of this second line of attack is\npresented in Locke\u2019s Essay. Locke raises the issue of\njust what innate knowledge is. Particular instances of knowledge are\nsupposed to be in our minds as part of our rational make-up, but how\nare they \u201cin our minds\u201d? If the implication is that we all\nconsciously have this knowledge, it is plainly false. Propositions\noften given as examples of innate knowledge, even such plausible\ncandidates as the principle that the same thing cannot both be and not\nbe, are not consciously accepted by children and those with severe\ncognitive limitations. If the point of calling such principles\n\u201cinnate\u201d is not to imply that they are or have been\nconsciously accepted by all rational beings, then it is hard to see\nwhat the point is. \u201cNo proposition can be said to be in the\nmind, which it never yet knew, which it never yet was conscious\nof\u201d (Essay, 1.2.5). Proponents of innate knowledge\nmight respond that some knowledge is innate in that we have the\ncapacity to have it. That claim, while true, is of little interest,\nhowever. \u201cIf the capacity of knowing, be the natural impression\ncontended for, all the truths a man ever comes to know, will, by this\naccount, be every one of them, innate; and this great point will\namount to no more, but only an improper way of speaking; which whilst\nit pretends to assert the contrary, says nothing different from those,\nwho deny innate principles. For nobody, I think, ever denied, that the\nmind was capable of knowing several truths\u201d (Essay,\n1.2.5). Locke thus challenges defenders of the Innate Knowledge thesis\nto present an account of innate knowledge that allows their position\nto be both true and interesting. A narrow interpretation of innateness\nfaces counterexamples of rational individuals who do not meet its\nconditions. A generous interpretation implies that all our knowledge,\neven that clearly provided by experience, is innate.\n\nDefenders of innate knowledge take up Locke\u2019s challenge. Leibniz\nresponds in New Essays by appealing to an account of\ninnateness in terms of natural potential to avoid Locke\u2019s\ndilemma. Consider Peter Carruthers\u2019 similar reply.\n\nWe have noted that while one form of nativism claims (somewhat\nimplausibly) that knowledge is innate in the sense of being present as\nsuch (or at least in propositional form) from birth, it might also be\nmaintained that knowledge is innate in the sense of being innately\ndetermined to make its appearance at some stage in childhood. This\nlatter thesis is surely the most plausible version of nativism. (1992,\np. 51)\n\n\nCarruthers claims that our innate knowledge is determined through\nevolutionary selection (p. 111). Evolution has resulted in our being\ndetermined to know certain things (e.g. principles of folk-psychology)\nat particular stages of our life, as part of our natural development.\nExperiences provide the occasion for our consciously believing the\nknown propositions but not the basis for our knowledge of them (p.\n52). Carruthers thus has a ready reply to Locke\u2019s\ncounterexamples of children and cognitively limited persons who do not\nbelieve propositions claimed to be instances of innate knowledge. The\nformer have not yet reached the proper stage of development; the\nlatter are persons in whom natural development has broken down (pp.\n49\u201350).\n\nA serious problem for the Innate Knowledge thesis remains, however. We\nknow a proposition only if it is true, we believe it and our belief is\nwarranted. Rationalists who assert the existence of innate knowledge\nare not just claiming that, as a matter of human evolution,\nGod\u2019s design or some other factor, at a particular point in our\ndevelopment, certain sorts of experiences trigger our belief in\nparticular propositions in a way that does not involve our learning\nthem from the experiences. Their claim is even bolder: In at least\nsome of these cases, our empirically triggered, but not empirically\nwarranted, belief is nonetheless warranted and so known. How can these\nbeliefs be warranted if they do not gain their warrant from the\nexperiences that cause us to have them or from intuition and\ndeduction?\n\nSome rationalists think that a reliabilist account of warrant provides\nthe answer. According to Reliabilism, beliefs are warranted if they\nare formed by a process that generally produces true beliefs rather\nthan false ones. The true beliefs that constitute our innate knowledge\nare warranted, then, because they are formed as the result of a\nreliable belief-forming process. Carruthers maintains that\n\u201cInnate beliefs will count as known provided that the process\nthrough which they come to be innate is a reliable one (provided, that\nis, that the process tends to generate beliefs that are true)\u201d\n(1992, p. 77). He argues that natural selection results in the\nformation of some beliefs and is a truth-reliable process.\n\nAn appeal to Reliabilism, or a similar causal theory of warrant, may\nwell be the best way to develop the Innate Knowledge thesis. Even so,\nsome difficulties remain. First, reliabilist accounts of warrant are\nthemselves quite controversial. Second, rationalists must give an\naccount of innate knowledge that maintains and explains the\ndistinction between innate knowledge and non-innate knowledge, and it\nis not clear that they will be able to do so within such an account of\nwarrant. Suppose for the sake of argument that we have innate\nknowledge of some proposition, P. What makes our knowledge\nthat P innate? To sharpen the question, what difference\nbetween our knowledge that P and a clear case of non-innate\nknowledge, say our knowledge that something is red based on our\ncurrent visual experience of a red table, makes the former innate and\nthe latter not innate? In each case, we have a true, warranted belief.\nIn each case, presumably, our belief gains its warrant from the fact\nthat it meets a particular causal condition, e.g., it is produced by a\nreliable process. In each case, the causal process is one in which an\nexperience causes us to believe the proposition at hand (that\nP; that something is red), for, as defenders of innate\nknowledge admit, our belief that P is \u201ctriggered\u201d\nby an experience, as is our belief that something is red. The insight\nbehind the Innate Knowledge thesis seems to be that the difference\nbetween our innate and non-innate knowledge lies in the relation\nbetween our experience and our belief in each case. The experience\nthat causes our belief that P does not \u201ccontain\u201d\nthe information that P, while our visual experience of a red\ntable does \u201ccontain\u201d the information that something is\nred. Yet, exactly what is the nature of this containment relation\nbetween our experiences, on the one hand, and what we believe, on the\nother, that is missing in the one case but present in the other? The\nnature of the experience-belief relation seems quite similar in each.\nThe causal relation between the experience that triggers our belief\nthat P and our belief that P is contingent, as is\nthe fact that the belief-forming process is reliable. The same is true\nof our experience of a red table and our belief that something is red.\nThe causal relation between the experience and our belief is again\ncontingent. We might have been so constructed that the experience we\ndescribe as \u201cbeing appeared to redly\u201d caused us to\nbelieve, not that something is red, but that something is hot. The\nprocess that takes us from the experience to our belief is also only\ncontingently reliable. Moreover, if our experience of a red table\n\u201ccontains\u201d the information that something is red, then\nthat fact, not the existence of a reliable belief-forming process\nbetween the two, should be the reason why the experience warrants our\nbelief. By appealing to Reliabilism, or some other causal theory of\nwarrant, rationalists may obtain a way to explain how innate knowledge\ncan be warranted. They still need to show how their explanation\nsupports an account of the difference between innate knowledge and\nnon-innate knowledge. So, Locke's criticism -- that there is no true\ndistinction between innate versus non-innate knowledge that\nrationalists may draw -- still stands, in the face of the best\nrationalist defense of the Innate Knowledge thesis.\n4. The Innate Concept Thesis\n\nAccording to the Innate Concept thesis, some of our concepts have not\nbeen gained from experience. They are instead part of our rational\nmake-up, and experience simply triggers a process by which we\nconsciously grasp them. The main concern motivating the rationalist\nshould be familiar by now: the content of some concepts seems to\noutstrip anything we could have gained from experience. An example of\nthis reasoning is presented by Descartes in the Meditations.\nAlthough he sometimes seems committed to the view that all our ideas\nare innate (Adams 1975 and Gotham 2002), he there classifies our ideas\nas adventitious, invented by us, and innate. Adventitious ideas, such\nas a sensation of heat, are gained directly through sense experience.\nIdeas invented by us, such as our idea of a hippogriff, are created by\nus from other ideas we possess. Innate ideas, such as our ideas of\nGod, of extended matter, of substance, and of a perfect triangle, are\nplaced in our minds by God at creation. Consider Descartes\u2019s\nargument that our concept of God, as an infinitely perfect being, is\ninnate. Our concept of God is not directly gained in experience, as\nparticular tastes, sensations, and mental images might be. Its content\nis beyond what we could ever construct by applying available mental\noperations to what experience directly provides. From experience, we\ncan gain the concept of a being with finite amounts of various\nperfections, one, for example, that is finitely knowledgeable,\npowerful and good. We cannot however move from these empirical\nconcepts to the concept of a being of infinite perfection. (\u201cI\nmust not think that, just as my conceptions of rest and darkness are\narrived at by negating movement and light, so my perception of the\ninfinite is arrived at not by means of a true idea but by merely\nnegating the finite,\u201d Third Meditation, p. 94.) Descartes\nsupplements this argument by another. Not only is the content of our\nconcept of God beyond what experience can provide, the concept is a\nprerequisite for our employment of the concept of finite perfection\ngained from experience. (\u201cMy perception of the infinite, that is\nGod, is in some way prior to my perception of the finite, that is\nmyself. For how could I understand that I doubted or\ndesired\u2014that is lacked something\u2014and that I was not wholly\nperfect, unless there were in me some idea of a more perfect being\nwhich enabled me to recognize my own defects by comparison,\u201d\nThird Meditation, p. 94).\n\nAn empiricist response to this general line of argument is given by\nLocke (Essay, 1.4.1\u201325). First, there is the problem of\nexplaining what it is for someone to have an innate concept. If having\nan innate concept entails consciously entertaining it at present or in\nthe past, then Descartes\u2019s position is open to obvious\ncounterexamples. Young children and people from other cultures do not\nconsciously entertain the concept of God and have not done so. Second,\nthere is the objection that we have no need to appeal to innate\nconcepts in the first place. Contrary to Descartes\u2019s argument,\nwe can explain how experience provides all our ideas, including those\nthe rationalists take to be innate, and with just the content that the\nrationalists attribute to them.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s New Essays offers a rationalist reply to the\nfirst concern. Where Locke puts forth the image of the mind as a blank\nslate on which experience writes, Leibniz offers us the image of a\nblock of marble, the veins of which determine what sculpted figures it\nwill accept (New Essays, Preface, p. 153). Leibniz\u2019s\nmetaphor contains an insight that Locke misses. The mind plays a role\nin determining the nature of its contents. This point does not,\nhowever, require the adoption of the Innate Concept thesis. Locke\nmight still point out that we are not required to have the concepts\nthemselves and the ability to use them, innately. In contemporary\nterms, what we are required to have is the right hardware that allows\nfor the optimal running of the actual software. For Locke, there are\nno constrains here; for Leibniz, only a particular type of software\nis, indeed, able to be supported by the extant hardware. Put\ndifferently, the hardware itself determines what software can be\noptimally run, for a Leibnizian.\n\nRationalists have responded to the second part of the empiricist\nattack on the Innate Concept thesis\u2014the empiricists\u2019 claim\nthat the thesis is without basis, as all our ideas can be explained as\nderived from experience\u2014by focusing on difficulties in the\nempiricists\u2019 attempts to give such an explanation. The\ndifficulties are illustrated by Locke\u2019s account. According to\nLocke, experience consists in external sensation and inner reflection.\nAll our ideas are either simple or complex, with the former being\nreceived by us passively in sensation or reflection and the latter\nbeing built by the mind from simple materials through various mental\noperations. Right at the start, the account of how simple ideas are\ngained is open to an obvious counterexample acknowledged, but then set\naside, by Hume in presenting his own empiricist theory. Consider the\nmental image of a particular shade of blue. If Locke is right, the\nidea is a simple one and should be passively received by the mind\nthrough experience. Hume points out otherwise:\n\nSuppose therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years\nand to have become perfectly acquainted with colors of all kinds,\nexcept one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has\nbeen his fortune to meet with; let all the different shades of that\ncolor, except that single one, be placed before him, descending\ngradually from the deepest to the lightest, it is plain that he will\nperceive a blank where that shade is wanting and will be sensible that\nthere is a greater distance in that place between the contiguous\ncolors than in any other. Now I ask whether it be possible for him,\nfrom his own imagination, to supply this deficiency and raise up to\nhimself the idea of that particular shade, though it had never been\nconveyed to him by his senses? I believe there are but few will be of\nthe opinion that he can\u2026 (Enquiry, 2, pp. 15\u201316)\n\n\nEven when it comes to such simple ideas as the image of a particular\nshade of blue, the mind seems to be more than a blank slate on which\nexperience writes. The main question is whether the veins in\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphor should count as part of the knowledge or just\nas part of our biological mental architecture: all the knowledge we\ncan ever acquire is constrained by the type of beings we are. This does\nnot require our positing that concepts be part of the inner workings,\nat the beginning of our lives.\n\nOn the other hand, consider, too, our concept of a particular color,\nsay red. Critics of Locke\u2019s account have pointed out the\nweaknesses in his explanation of how we gain such a concept by the\nmental operation of abstraction on individual cases. For one thing, it\nmakes the incorrect assumption that various instances of a particular\nconcept share a common feature. Carruthers puts the objection as\nfollows:\n\nIn fact problems arise for empiricists even in connection with the\nvery simplest concepts, such as those of colour. For it is false that\nall instances of a given colour share some common feature. In which\ncase we cannot acquire the concept of that colour by abstracting the\ncommon feature of our experience. Thus consider the concept\nred. Do all shades of red have something in common? If so,\nwhat? It is surely false that individual shades of red consist, as it\nwere, of two distinguishable elements a general redness together with\na particular shade. Rather, redness consists in a continuous\nrange of shades, each of which is only just distinguishable\nfrom its neighbors. Acquiring the concept red is a matter of\nlearning the extent of the range. (1992, p. 59)\n\n\nFor another thing, Locke\u2019s account of concept acquisition from\nparticular experiences seems circular: \u201cFor noticing or\nattending to a common feature of various things presupposes that you\nalready possess the concept of the feature in question.\u201d\n(Carruthers 1992, p. 55)\n\nConsider in this regard Locke\u2019s account of how we gain our\nconcept of causation.\n\nIn the notice that our senses take of the constant vicissitude of\nthings, we cannot but observe, that several particulars, both\nqualities and substances; begin to exist; and that they receive this\ntheir existence from the due application and operation of some other\nbeing. From this observation, we get our ideas of cause and effect.\n(Essay, 2.26.1)\n\n\nWe get our concept of causation from our observation that some things\nreceive their existence from the application and operation of some\nother things. Yet, to be able to make this observation, we must have\nour minds primed to do so. Rationalists argue that we cannot make this\nobservation unless we already have the concept of causation.\nEmpiricists, on the other hand, argue that our minds are constituted\nin a certain way, so that we can gain our ideas of causation and of\npower in a non-circular manner.\n\nRationalists would argue that Locke\u2019s account of how we gain our\nidea of power displays a similar circularity.\n\nThe mind being every day informed, by the senses, of the alteration of\nthose simple ideas, it observes in things without; and taking notice\nhow one comes to an end, and ceases to be, and another begins to exist\nwhich was not before; reflecting also on what passes within itself,\nand observing a constant change of its ideas, sometimes by the\nimpression of outward objects on the senses, and sometimes by the\ndetermination of its own choice; and concluding from what it has so\nconstantly observed to have been, that the like changes will for the\nfuture be made in the same things, by like agents, and by the like\nways, considers in one thing the possibility of having any of its\nsimple ideas changed, and in another the possibility of making that\nchange; and so comes by that idea which we call power.\n(Essay, 2.21.1)\n\n\nWe come by the idea of power though considering the possibility of\nchanges in our ideas made by experiences and our own choices. Yet, to\nconsider this possibility\u2014of some things making a\nchange in others\u2014we must already have a concept of power,\nrationalists would say. Empiricists, on the other hand, would point\nout, again, that what we actually need is for our minds to be able to\nrecognize this, by having the correct abilities and faculties. Just as\nwe don\u2019t need to have a concept telling us how it is that we\nhave binocular vision, being able to recognize change would be cashed\nout by us having the requisite faculty enabling us to do so.\n\nAnother way to meet at least some of these challenges to an empiricist\naccount of the origin of our concepts is to revise our understanding\nof the content of our concepts so as to bring them more in line with\nwhat experience will clearly provide. Hume famously takes this\napproach. Beginning in a way reminiscent of Locke, he distinguishes\nbetween two forms of mental contents or \u201cperceptions,\u201d as\nhe calls them: impressions and ideas. Impressions are the contents of\nour current experiences: our sensations, feelings, emotions, desires,\nand so on. Ideas are mental contents derived from impressions. Simple\nideas are copies of impressions; complex ideas are derived from\nimpressions by \u201ccompounding, transposing, augmenting or\ndiminishing\u201d them. Given that all our ideas are thus gained from\nexperience, Hume offers us the following method for determining the\ncontent of any idea and thereby the meaning of any term taken to\nexpress it.\n\nWhen we entertain, therefore, any suspicion that a philosophical term\nis employed without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent), we\nneed but inquire from what impression is that supposed idea\nderived? And if it be impossible to assign any, this will confirm\nour suspicion. (Enquiry, 2, p. 16)\n\n\nUsing this test, Hume draws out one of the most important implications\nof the empiricists\u2019 denial of the Innate Concept thesis. If\nexperience is indeed the source of all ideas, then our experiences\nalso determine the content of our ideas. Our ideas of causation, of\nsubstance, of right and wrong have their content determined by the\nexperiences that provide them. Those experiences, Hume argues, are\nunable to support the content that many rationalists and some\nempiricists, such as Locke, attribute to the corresponding ideas. Our\ninability to explain how some concepts, with the contents the\nrationalists attribute to them, are gained from experience should not\nlead us to adopt the Innate Concept thesis. It should lead us to\naccept a more limited view of the contents for those concepts, and\nthereby a more limited view of our ability to describe and understand\nthe world.\n\nConsider, for example, our idea of causation. Descartes takes it to be\ninnate. Hume\u2019s empiricist account severely limits its content.\nOur idea of causation is derived from a feeling of expectation rooted\nin our experiences of the constant conjunction of similar causes and\neffects.\n\nIt appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connection among\nevents arises from a number of similar instances which occur, of the\nconstant conjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be\nsuggested by any one of these instances surveyed in all possible\nlights and positions. But there is nothing in a number of instances,\ndifferent from every single instance, which is supposed to be exactly\nsimilar, except only that after a repetition of similar instances the\nmind is carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect\nits usual attendant and to believe that it will exist. This\nconnection, therefore, which we feel in the mind, this\ncustomary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual\nattendant, is the sentiment or impression from which we form the idea\nof power or necessary connection. (Enquiry, 7.2, p. 59)\n\n\nThe source of our idea in experience determines its content.\n\nSuitably to this experience, therefore, we may define a cause to be an\nobject followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the\nfirst are followed by objects similar to the second\u2026 We may,\ntherefore, suitably to this experience, form another definition of\ncause and call it an object followed by another, and whose\nappearance always conveys the thought of the other.\n(Enquiry, 7.2, p. 60)\n\n\nOur claims, and any knowledge we may have, about causal connections in\nthe world turn out, given the limited content of our empirically based\nconcept of causation, to be claims and knowledge about the constant\nconjunction of events and our own feelings of expectation. Thus, the\ninitial disagreement between rationalists and empiricists about the\nsource of our ideas leads to one about their content and thereby the\ncontent of our descriptions and knowledge of the world.\n\nLike philosophical debates generally, the rationalist/empiricist\ndebate ultimately concerns our position in the world, in this case our\nposition as rational inquirers. To what extent do our faculties of\nreason and experience support our attempts to know and understand our\nsituation?\n",
