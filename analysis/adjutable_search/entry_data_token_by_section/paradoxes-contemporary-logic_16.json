    "main_text": "Paradoxes: between metamathematics and type-free foundations (1930\u20131945) || \u201cThe inconsistency of certain formal logics\u201d\n5.3 \u201cThe inconsistency of certain formal logics\u201d\n\nIn the twenties and in the early thirties, the orthodox view of logic\namong mathematical logicians was more or less type- or set theoretic.\nHowever, there was an effort to develop new grand logics as\nsubstitutes for the logic of Principia Mathematica. These\nframeworks arose both as attempts to recover the simplicity of the\ntype-free approach, as derived from the so-called naive comprehension\nprinciple, as well as in order to satisfy metamathematical needs, such\nas the clarification of fundamental concepts underlying the notions of\n\u201cformal system,\u201d \u201cformalism,\u201d\n\u201crule,\u201d etc. In particular, Church and Curry proposed\ntheories which (i) assume as primitive the notions of self-applicable\nfunction-in-intension (operation), and (ii) stress the very mechanism\nof definition/combination of concepts. If one looks closely at the\ndevelopment of these systems, one can see that paradoxical\nconstructions have become essential tools for defining objects and\nproving non-trivial logical mathematical facts. Following ideas\nof Sch\u00f6nfinkel and aiming at a mathematical analysis of the\nsubstitution process, Curry\u2019s 1930 thesis introduced a formal\nlanguage based on basic general operators, the so-called\ncombinators \\(B\\) (composition), \\(C\\) (permutation), \\(W\\)\n(duplication), \\(K\\) (cancellation), \\(Q\\) (equality), and logical\nconstants like the universal quantifier and implication. Expressions\nare then inductively generated by application from constants;\nintuitively, a term \\(M\\) stands for a function, and the applicative\nterm \\(MN\\) (juxtaposition plays the role of application and\nparentheses are associated to the left) denotes the value of the term\nobtained by replacing the first variable of \\(M\\) with \\(N\\).\nSelf-application \\(MM\\) is admissible and this feature tells us that\nthe objects of combinatory logic cannot be simply interpreted as\nset-theoretic functions. The formal system consists of standard\nequations on combinators (e.g, \\(Bxyz=x(yz), Wxy=xyy\\), or\n\\(Cxyz=xzy)\\), rules for equality and the logical constants; its main\ngoal is to derive equalities \\(X=Y\\) and to make assertions of the\nform \\(\\vdash X (= X\\) is provable). Combinatory logic is a theory\nwhich analyzes the modes of combinations of formal objects,\nsubstitution, and the notions of proposition and propositional\nfunction (see the entry on\n combinatory logic\n for a proper introduction to variants of the formalism and an\noverview of the properties of related calculi). For Curry, the root of\nthe paradoxes is found in assuming that combinations of concepts\nare always propositions. The notion of proposition becomes a\ntheoretical concept, which is decided by the theory. Types\nare not assigned to the expressions of the formal system at the\noutset, but are instead inferred by means of the system itself, which\nhas a dual nature: it can derive identities, but also truths. In\nparticular, if \\(\\vdash MN\\) is derived, this can be read as\n\u201c\\(N\\) is of type \\(M\\)\u201d or \u201c\\(N\\) is an element of\n\\(M\\)\u201d. These ideas foreshadow fundamental developments such as\nthe so-called formulas-as types interpretation (see Howard\n1968).\n\nChurch\u2019s formalism\u2014originally introduced in Church 1932,\n1933 as a set of postulates for the foundation of formal\nlogic\u2014includes conversion (i.e., computational) rules, which\nallow the replacement of terms with intensionally equivalent ones, and\nrules for asserting certain terms as \u201ctrue\u201d. The syntax\nyields a general notation system for functions, based on an\napplicative language, where there is one basic category of terms\n(well-formed formulas in his terminology). Some terms are formally\nprovable (or assertable) and are classified as true. Terms are\ninductively defined from a set of basic constants and variables by\nmeans of application and the characteristic lambda abstraction\noperator: if \\(M\\) is a term containing the variable \\(x, \\lambda\nx.M\\) is a term, naming the function defined by \\(M\\). The basic\nconstants designate logical operations: (a kind of restricted) formal\nimplication; existential quantifier, conjunction, negation,\ndescription operation, and generalized abstraction (i.e., if \\(F\\) is\nformal logical equivalence, \\(A(F, M)\\) is \u201cwhat \\(M\\) has in\ncommon with any \\(N\\) formally equivalent to \\(M\\)\u201d). It turns\nout that Church\u2019s logic can interpret naive class theory and\nhence the system is suspiciously strong and expressive (strength and\nexpressivity are inherited by the formalism which was devised out of\nChurch\u2019s: see the entry on\n the lambda calculus).\n Church\u2019s hope was that contradictions could be avoided by\nensuring the possibility that a propositional function be\nundefined for some argument.\n\nHowever, the theories of Curry and Church were almost immediately\nshown inconsistent in 1934, by Kleene and Rosser, who (essentially)\nproved a version of the Richard paradox (both systems can provably\nenumerate their own provably total definable number theoretic\nfunctions). The result was triggered by Church himself in 1934, when\nhe used the Richard paradox to prove a kind of incompleteness theorem\n(with respect to statements asserting the totality of number theoretic\nfunctions).\n\nThe reason for the inconsistencies was eventually clarified by\nCurry\u2019s 1941 essay. There he distinguishes two basic\ncompleteness notions: a system \\(S\\) is deductively complete,\nif, whenever it derives a proposition \\(B\\) from the hypothesis \\(A\\),\nthen it also derives the implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) (deduction\ntheorem or introduction rule for implication); \\(S\\) is\ncombinatorially complete (Curry 1941, p. 455.) if, whenever\n\\(M\\) is a term of the system possibly containing an indeterminate\n\\(x\\), there exists a term (Church\u2019s \\(\\lambda x.M)\\) naming the\nfunction of \\(x\\) defined by \\(M\\). Curry then remarks that the\nparadox of Kleene-Rosser arises because Church\u2019s and\nCurry\u2019s systems satisfy both kinds of completeness, thus showing\nthat the two properties are incompatible. In the more\ntechnical part of the paper, Curry carefully axiomatizes the main\ningredients exploited by Kleene and Rosser and carries out a lot of\nnon-trivial work both on the logical side and the mathematical side\n(e.g, to develop a portion of recursive arithmetic, to define the\nexistence of an enumerator, i.e., a term \\(T\\) such that, if \\(a\\) is\nthe G\u00f6del number of a closed term \\(M\\) and \\(Z_a\\) is the term\nformally representing \\(a\\), then \\(TZ_a =M\\) is provable in \\(S\\),\netc.). Curry\u2019s proof of the inconsistencies of combinatory\nsystems is unsatisfactory because it heavily uses a detour through\nnumber theory and G\u00f6delization, which, as a matter of fact, is\nunnecessary as Curry himself soon discovered and presented in a paper\nwith the same title as the one by Kleene and Rosser, \u201cin\ndeference to the original discoverers of the contradiction\u201d\n(Curry 1942). The main result in it is the following theorem\n(Curry\u2019s paradox, see the entry\n Curry\u2019s Paradox):\n\nassume that we have a combinatorially complete system, i.e.,\nessentially a system of combinatory logic which contains the standard\nproperties of equality and the basic axioms ensuring the definability\nof Church\u2019s lambda with the corresponding axioms defining \\(B,\nC, I, W\\);\nassume also that the system contains an implication operator \\(\\supset\\) satisfying, for arbitrary terms \\(M, N\\) \\[\\begin{align*} & \\vdash M \\supset M \\\\ & \\vdash M \\supset( M\\supset N) \\Rightarrow \\vdash M \\supset N \\\\ & \\vdash M \\text{ and } \\vdash M\\supset N\\Rightarrow \\vdash N. \\\\ & \\text{Then } S \\vdash M, \\text{ for every term } M. \\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nFor the proof, it is enough to find, for any given term B, a term A\nsuch that \\(A=A\\supset B\\). Curry notes that a twofold construction is\npossible. By direct self-reference, we can choose: \\(A = HH\\), where\n\\(H=\\lambda Y (N(YY))\\) and \\(N = \\lambda X (X\\supset B)\\). On the\nother hand, one can apply indirect self-reference and exploit the\nmachinery of Curry 1941 and Kleene-Rosser: using an enumerator \\(T\\),\none sets \\(U = \\lambda X (TXX \\supset B)\\) and \\(A=UZ_u\\), being \\(u\\)\nthe G\u00f6del number of \\(U\\). Curry suggests that these two routes\nare akin, respectively, to Russell\u2019s paradox and to the Liar. It\nis interesting to note that the two ways correspond to by-now standard\ntools, the so-called first fixed point theorem and second\nfixed point theorem of combinatory logic and lambda calculus\n(Barendregt 1984, p. 131 and p. 143; see also the distinction between\nthe first recursion theorem and the second recursion theorem of\nclassical recursion theory, in this SEP, entry\n recursive functions).\n\nCurry\u2019s analysis of the solutions to the paradox would lead us\ninto the realm of the theory of functionality, the history of\ncombinatory logic and proof theory. Here it is enough to recall that\naccording to him, a remedy would be to formulate within the system the\nvery notion of proposition, and a way to avoid the contradictions\nwould lead to a hierarchy of canonical propositions (or to a theory of\nlevels of implication, already adumbrated by Church). Related ideas\nhave been developed since the seventies by Scott 1975, Aczel 1980,\nFlagg and Myhill 1987, and others.\n",
