    "main_text": "Dynamic Epistemic Paradoxes || Dogmatism paradox: A puzzle about losing knowledge\n6.3 The Future of Epistemic Paradoxes\n\nWe cannot predict that any specific new epistemic paradox awaits\ndiscovery. To see why, consider the prediction Jon Wynne-Tyson\nattributes to Leonardo Da Vinci: \u201cI have learned from an early\nage to abjure the use of meat, and the time will come when men such as\nI will look upon the murder of animals as they now look upon the\nmurder of men.\u201d (1985, 65) By predicting this progress, Leonardo\ninadvertently reveals he already believes that the murder of\nanimals is the same as the murder of men. If you believe that a\nproposition is true but will be first believed at a later time, then\nyou already believe it \u2013 and so are inconsistent. (The actual\ntruth is irrelevant.)\n\nSpecific regress can be anticipated. When I try to predict my first\nacquisition of a specific truth, I pre-empt myself. When I try to\npredict my first acquisition of a specific falsehood, there is no\npre-emption.\n\nThere would be no problem with predicting progress if Leonardo thinks\nthe moral progress lies in the moral preferability of the vegetarian\nbelief rather than the truth of the matter. One might admire\nvegetarianism without accepting the correctness of vegetarianism. But\nLeonardo is endorsing the correctness of the belief. This sentence\nembodies a Moorean absurdity. It is like saying \u2018Leonardo took\ntwenty five years to complete The Virgin on the Rocks but I\nwill first believe so tomorrow\u2019. (This absurdity will prompt\nsome to object that I have uncharitably interpreted Leonardo; he must\nhave intended to make an exception for himself and only be referring\nto men of his kind.)\n\nI cannot specifically anticipate the first acquisition of the true\nbelief that \\(p\\). For that prediction would show that\nI already have the true belief that \\(p\\). The truth\ncannot wait. The impatience of the truth imposes a limit on the\nprediction of discoveries.\n",
