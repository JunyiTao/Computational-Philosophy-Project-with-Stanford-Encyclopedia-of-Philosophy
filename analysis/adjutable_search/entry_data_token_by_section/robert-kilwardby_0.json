    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nRobert Kilwardby was an Englishman born either in Leicestershire or in\nYorkshire, probably, in 1215. He started his university studies in\nParis around 1231, becoming a Master of Arts around 1237. He taught\nthere until 1245, when he moved back to England, at which time he\nentered into the Dominican Order. This marked the beginning of a\nrather successful ecclesiastic career. At Oxford (from ca. 1254\nonwards), he studied and taught theology until 1261, when he was\nelected Prior Provincial of the English Dominicans. In 1269 he\nparticipated in the Dominican General Chapter in Paris where he,\ntogether with Thomas Aquinas (and other members), was responsible for\nanalyzing the process of Bartholomew of Tours (MOPH I, 155). During\nthis period he was also involved in a polemic about the nature of\npoverty with the Franciscans, after sending a letter on this topic to\nthe novices of his Dominican Order. Kilwardby\u2019s letter is now lost, so\nour knowledge of this dispute comes from a response by the Franciscan\nJohn Pecham, who rebuts Kilwardby\u2019s claims, while citing extensively\nfrom the Dominican\u2019s text. Pecham\u2019s hostility towards Kilwardby would\ncontinue later on, when he accuses Kilwardby of stealing\ndocuments\u2014the register and the records of the See and objects\nfrom the See of Canterbury\u2014after Kilwardby\u2019s departure from the\nSee of Canterbury. Kilwardby was nominated Archbishop of Canterbury in\n1272. Two of his acts as Archbishop were the coronation of Edward I,\nat Westminster Abbey, on the 19th of August 1274 and the issuing of\nthe Prohibitions of Oxford on the 18th of March 1277 (see Silva\n2012).\n\nKilwardby\u2019s participation in this last event is at the same time the\nsource of his fame and disgrace. The episode itself consisted in the\nissuing of a list of 30 denounced articles focusing on the subjects of\ngrammar (4), logic (10), and natural philosophy (16). Despite\nconstituting a major episode of academic censorship in the medieval\nperiod, there are two formal points which should not be overlooked:\nfirst, the prohibitory rather than condemnatory nature of the\nlist\u2014Kilwardby was explicit that these articles were to be\nprohibited for being primarily philosophical mistakes and only\nsecondarily against Christian dogma. Anyone found guilty of defending\nand disseminating these mistakes was, if a Master, to be removed from\nhis teaching position, and if not yet a Master, never to become one\nand to be expelled from the university. Second, this list was not the\nresult of the Archbishop\u2019s visit to the University of Oxford and a\nsubsequent ill-will towards it, but rather it expressed the consensus\nof all the regent and non-regent Masters of the University, if the\nofficial documents are to be believed.\n\nThe proximity to the the Condemnations of Paris, issued just eleven\ndays earlier, gave rise to substantial speculation about the relation\nbetween these two episodes of censorship. However, no proof of\nconnection between them has been presented, nor does it seem that\nKilwardby was acting under Papal orders. The direct targets of these\npropositions are still to be identified. Nevertheless, already in\nKilwardby\u2019s time, some of the propositions in naturalibus\nwere interpreted as aimed at the teaching of Thomas Aquinas, namely\nthose propositions related to his doctrine of the unicity of\nsubstantial form. The first reaction came in a letter written by Peter\nof Conflans, a disciple of Aquinas, to which Kilwardby replies in a\ndetailed manner. (Peter\u2019s letter has not survived but passages are\nquoted by Kilwardby.) Kilwardby\u2019s answer constitutes the clearest\nexpression of his theory of the plurality of substantial forms in\nhuman beings and perhaps the first explicit defense of such a theory.\nA more institutional reaction took place when the General Chapter of\nthe Order, to which both Aquinas and Kilwardby belonged, met in Milan\n(1278) and decided to send a commission in order to investigate and\npunish those who blackened the writings of Thomas Aquinas scandalizing\nthe order (in scandalum ordinis). The results of this\ncommission are unknown. The next Chapter, held in Paris, repeated the\nrecommendation and urged the praise of Thomas\u2019 works. Meanwhile, Pope\nNicholas III appointed Kilwardby to the post of Cardinal of Porto and\nS. Rufina in 1278, which allowed him to move from England to Italy.\nThis nomination can be understood either as an attempt to protect\nKilwardby from his own Order or as a way of stopping Kilwardby\u2019s\nactions against Thomas and Thomism. The Oxford Prohibitions were later\ninterpreted as a campaign against Thomism (Callus 1955), but this\ninterpretation has been challenged (Wilshire 1964). A conciliatory\napproach could be that in the Prohibitions Kilwardby was criticizing a\npresumed interpretation of Aristotle that made Aristotle\u2019s doctrine\nincompatible with his own reading of Augustine. Kilwardby died in\n1279, soon after his arrival at the Papal court in Viterbo, where he\nlies buried. (For more bibliographical details, see\nSommer-Seckendorff, 1937; see also Silva 2011; and Silva 2020.)\n\nTwo final remarks about Kilwardby\u2019s life and thought. First, although\nhe came to be known as a polemicist, the leitmotif of his work was to\nharmonize/reconcile Aristotle and Augustine\u2014a certain\nunderstanding of Aristotle with a certain understanding of Augustine,\nthat is. Second, his life\u2019s work seems to move against the mainstream\nof the century he lived in. Most authors had adopted the new\nAristotelian philosophy that new translations of known works and\nespecially recently discovered ones (to the Latin West, that is) just\nmade available. Many an author, challenged by these texts, changed\ntheir philosophical alliances from traditional Augustinian thought to\na more modern and progressive Aristotelianism, \u201cspiced up\u201d\nby its Arabic commentators. Kilwardby, however, started his career by\nbeing a faithful Aristotelian, as his commentaries (mostly on logic)\non the works of the Greek philosopher testify. It is only after he had\nbeen for some time a Master of Arts at the University of Paris that\nhis philosophical views changed to become more and more influenced by\nAugustine. If one were to define Kilwardby\u2019s philosophical\ncommitments, it would be more correct to say that he was originally an\nAristotelian and converted to Augustinianism without ever ceasing to\nbe an interpreter of Aristotle. Once we keep in mind that he remained\nan Aristotelian throughout his career\u2014of an eclectic type, it\nmust be said\u2014his thought becomes easier to understand because we\nare not drawing him against an anti-Aristotelian background that\ndoesn\u2019t fit the theoretical framework he developed during his academic\ncareer.\n\nA complete list of works by Kilwardby includes texts on logic,\ngrammar, theology, and natural philosophy. These texts vary greatly in\nterms of the influence they exerted on later thought, with the logical\ncommentaries occupying a place of relevance. Kilwardby\u2019s works are\nspread over three main periods: the Parisian period between 1237 and\n1245; the middle period, around 1245\u20131250; and the Oxonian\nperiod from 1250 to 1279.\n\nIn the Parisian period Kilwardby wrote mainly logical commentaries,\namong which should be counted those included in the Course on the\nLogica Vetus (Lewry 1978): on the Isagoge,\nPraedicamenta, Perihermeneias, Liber Sex\nPrincipiorum, and Liber divisionum Boethii. The edition\nof the whole course was started by the late Patrick Osmund Lewry and\nis currently being completed by Alessandro Conti (University of\nL\u2019Aquila,\n Italy).[1]\n The commentary on the Isagoge has been the object of a\ncomparative study by David Pich\u00e9 (2002), and the commentary on\nthe Categories is available on-line in a provisory edition by\nAlessandro Conti. Kilwardby also wrote commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nPrior and Posterior Analytics (the former published\nunder the name of Giles of Rome), as well as the commentaries In\nlibrum topycorum (partialy edited by Weijers, 1995; the\nattribution of this work still remains uncertain), De Sophistici\nElenchi, In Priscianus Minor, and Notulae libri\nPrisciani De accentibus (ed. Lewry, 1988). The commentary on the\nPrior Analytics was recently edited and translated by Paul\nThom and John Scott\u2014having received careful examination in Thom\n2007\u2014and the Commentary on the Posterior Analytics has\nreceived a provisory critical edition in an unpublished PhD\ndissertation by Debora Cannone (2003\u20132004) and more recently\nexamined in Thom 2019. The commentary on the Priscianus Minor\nremains unedited, but has been examined by Ir\u00e8ne Rosier (1994),\nwho transcribes the most relevant passages. Kilwardby is also the\nauthor of a Commentary on the Old and New Ethics; the edition\nof this commentary, which was started by Lewry and continued by\nAnthony Celano (Stonehill College), is now\n forthcoming.[2]\n\nFrom the same period, and previously thought to be Kilwardby\u2019s but now\ngenerally regarded as unauthentic, are the In Priscianus\nMaior and the Sophismata grammaticalia. Also the\nauthorship of In Donati artem maiorem III (ed.\nSchm\u00fccker, 1984) and Sophismata logicalia is now highly\n disputable.[3]\n The commentaries on the Physics and on the\nMetaphysics that were identified by G\u00e1l (1953) are now\nsecurely attributed to Geoffrey of Aspall (Macrae 1968).\n\nIn the period around 1245\u20131250, when he was moving from Paris to\nOxford, Kilwardby wrote the encyclopaedic treatise De ortu\nscientiarum (ed. Judy, 1976), a treatise on the nature of time\n(De tempore), and a work on perception entitled De\nspiritu fantastico (both works were edited by Lewry, 1987).\n\nDuring the Oxford period (after 1250) Kilwardby wrote an array of\ndisparate works: De natura relationis, Quaestiones in\nquattuor libros Sententiarum, De 43 questionibus, and\nEpistola ad Petrum de Confleto. All these works have been\nedited, even if not all in a critical edition. From the same period\nare also some minor theological works such as De confessione,\nDe necessitate Incarnationis, De conscientia et de\nsynderesi, the Tabulae super originalia patrum, the\nArbor consanguinitatis et affinitatis, and some\nsermons\u2014the Sermo in capite ieiunii and the Sermo\nin dominica in Passione. The two sermons have been edited, as\nwell as the work on the necessity of the Incarnation. Worth mentioning\nis a letter expressing some criticism over Franciscan poverty\n(Epistola ad novitios de excellentia Ordine Praedicatorum),\nwhich survives in John Pecham\u2019s answer (Tractatus contra fratrem\nRobertum Kilwardby), edited in Pecham\u2019s Tractatus tres de\npaupertate.\n\nEarly lists of works, such as the Stams Catalogue, attribute\nto Kilwardby the De unitate formarum, De physica,\nand De metaphysica, whereas Nicholas Trivet mentions the\ntreatise De universali. This latter work is possibly a\nreference to a passage in Kilwardby\u2019s Notule Libri\nPosteriorum\u2014\u201cHec est pars in qua Aristotiles\ndeterminat de uniuersali\u201d (Cannone 2002, 132)\u2014which might\nhave circulated isolated from the rest of the work. In the same way,\nthe work De unitate formarum clearly is the last (7th)\narticle of Kilwardby\u2019s answer to a letter sent to him by Peter of\nConflans, and it is found alone in some manuscripts.\n\nRecent years have exhibited an increased interest in Kilwardby\u2019s\nthought and this has been accompanied by substantial editorial work,\neven if much remains to be done. The texts from the middle and later\nperiods are almost all edited. With the edition of his commentaries on\nthe Prior and Posterior Analytics, as well as on the\nEthics, only the commentaries of the old logic and the\ngrammatical works remain unpublished. Recent work by\nMora-M\u00e1rquez, Thom, Hansen, Conti, Silva and Th\u00f6rnqvist to\nname just a few (see Bibliography), has focused on logical aspects of\nKilwardby\u2019s thought in relation to some of his philosophical\ninterlocutors, such as John Pagus, Nicholas of Paris, and Albert the\nGreat. In this article I will focus on a cursory presentation of\nKilwardby\u2019s main philosophical doctrines. A fuller account of these,\nwith exception to 5.2.4, 6, and 7, can be found in Silva 2007, 2008,\n2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2020.\n",
