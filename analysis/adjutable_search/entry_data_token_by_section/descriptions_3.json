Accordingly,\nthere is a kind of ambiguity in (4): on one reading it can be\ninterpreted as asserting that it is not the case that the present king\nof France exists, while on another reading it can be interpreted as\nasserting, about the present king of France, that he doesn't\nexist. These two reading can be captured by a difference in logical\nform, i.e., by representing the difference using the following two\nlogical forms.\n\n(4a) not ([the x: x is a present king of France]\nx exists)\n\n\n(4b) [the x: x is a present king of France] not\n(x exists)\n\n\nHere we are using the restricted quantifier notation adopted\nin Neale (1990). So for example, we read:\n\n(5) [the x: Fx](Gx)\n\n\nas saying \u201cthe x such that x is F, is\nsuch that x is G\u201d. The material in the square\nbrackets gives the restriction on the quantifier, and the\nformula in parentheses after the bracket constitutes the scope of the\nrestricted quantifier. (We sometimes drop the outer parentheses when\nit is clear what the scope of the restricted quantifier is, and we\nsometimes add parentheses around the entire formula for\ndisambiguation.) Thus, (4a) captures the fact that the negation has\nwide scope in a manner that can be glossed thus: it is not the case\nthat the x such that x is the present king of France\nexists. Whereas (4b) gives the restricted quantifier wide scope, in a\nmanner that can be glossed this way: the x such that\nx is the present king of France does not exist.\n\nIf one wants to avoid the ontological entanglements of nonexistent\nobjects, then one is free to say that (4b) is false (since it involves\nquantifying over things that don\u2019t exist) but that (4a) is true\n(since it is not the case that there is a present king of France).\nWhat is negated in (4a) is not a claim about some particular\nindividual, but rather a general claim about the world\u2014in effect\na claim that the world contains exactly one individual that is\npresently the king of France and that whoever is presently the king of\nFrance exists.\n",
