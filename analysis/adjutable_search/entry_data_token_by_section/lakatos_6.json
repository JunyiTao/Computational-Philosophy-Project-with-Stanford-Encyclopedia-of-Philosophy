Here Popper predominates and Hegel\nrecedes. Regress is a critique of both logicism and\nformalism proper (that is, Hilbert\u2019s programme), concentrating\nprimarily on Russell. Russell sought to rescue mathematics from doubt\nand uncertainty by deriving the totality of mathematics from\nself-evident logical axioms via stipulative definitions and\nwater-tight rules of inference. But the discovery of Russell\u2019s\nParadox and the felt need to deal with the Liar and related paradoxes\nblew this ambition sky-high. For some of the axioms that Russell was\nforced to posit\u2014the Theory of Types which Lakatos sees, in\neffect, as a monster-barring definition (elevated into an axiom) that\navoids the paradoxes by excluding self-referential propositions as\nmeaningless; the Axiom of Reducibility which is needed to relax the\nunduly restrictive Theory of Types; the Axiom of Infinity which posits\nan infinity of objects in order to ensure that every natural number\nhas a successor; and the Axiom of Choice (which Russell refers to as\nthe multiplicative axiom)\u2014were either not self-evident,\nnot logical or both. Russell\u2019s fall-back position was\nto argue that mathematics was not justified by being derivable from\nhis axioms but that his axioms were justified because the truths of\nmathematics could be derived from them whilst avoiding\ncontradictions:\n\n\nWhen pure mathematics is organized as a deductive system\u2026it\nbecomes obvious that, if we are to believe in the truth of pure\nmathematics, it cannot be solely because we believe in the truth of\nthe set of premises. Some of the premises are much less obvious than\nsome of their consequences, and are believed chiefly because of their\nconsequences. (Russell 2010 [1918]: 129)\n\n\nAs Lakatos amply documents in Renaissance, a\nsurprising number of labourers in the foundationalist\nvinyard\u2014Carnap and Quine, Fraenkel and G\u00f6del, Mostowski and\nvon Neumann\u2014were prepared to make similar noises. Lakatos dubs\nthis development \u201cempiricism\u201d (or\n\u201cquasi-empiricism\u201d) and hails it on the one hand whilst\ncondemning it on the other.\n\nWhy \u201cempiricism\u201d? Not because it revives Mill\u2019s idea\nthat the truths of arithmetic are empirical generalizations, but\nbecause it ascribes to mathematics the same kind of\nhypothetico-deductive structure that the empirical sciences supposedly\ndisplay, with axioms playing the part of theories and their\nmathematical consequences playing the part of observation-statements\n(or in Lakatos\u2019s terminology, \u201cpotential\nfalsifiers\u201d).\n\nWhy does Lakatos hail the \u201cempiricism\u201d that he also\ncondemns? Because it means that mathematics has the same kind\nepistemic structure that science has according to Popper. It\u2019s a\nmatter of axiomatic conjectures that can be mathematically refuted.\n(The difference between science and mathematics consists in the\ndifferences between the potential falsifiers.)\n\nWhy does Lakatos condemn the \u201cempiricism\u201d that he also\ncommends? Because Russell, like most of his supporters, succumbs to\nthe \u201cinductivist\u201d illusion that the axioms can be\nconfirmed by the truth of their consequences. In Lakatos\u2019s\nopinion this is simply a mistake. Truth can trickle down from the\naxioms to their consequences and falsity can flow upwards from the\nconsequences to the axioms (or at least to the axiom set). But neither\ntruth nor probability nor justified belief can flow up from the\nconsequences to the axioms from which they follow. Here Lakatos\nout-Poppers Popper, portraying not just science but even mathematics\nas a collection of unsupported conjectures that can be refuted but not\nconfirmed, anything else being condemned as to\n\u201cinductivism\u201d. However the inductivism that Lakatos\nscornfully rejects in Renaissance is just the kind of\ninductivism that he would be recommending to Popper just a few years\nlater.\n",
