    "main_text": "Queer Theory and the Social Construction of Sexuality\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe debates about homosexuality, in part because they often involve\npublic policy and legal issues, tend to be sharply polarized. Those\nmost concerned with homosexuality, positively or negatively, are also\nthose most engaged, with natural law theorists arguing for gays and\nlesbians having a reduced legal status, and queer theorists engaged in\ncritique and deconstruction of what they see as a heterosexist regime.\nYet the two do not talk much to one another, but rather ignore or talk\npast one another. There are some theorists in the middle. For example,\nMichael Sandel takes an Aristotelian approach from which he argues\nthat gay and lesbian relationships can realize the same goods that\nheterosexual relationships do (Sandel, 1995). He largely shares the\naccount of important human goods that natural law theorists have, yet\nin his evaluation of the worth of same-sex relationships, he is\nclearly sympathetic to gay and lesbian concerns. Similarly, Bruce\nBawer (1993) and Andrew Sullivan (1995) have written eloquent defenses\nof full legal equality for gays and lesbians, including marriage\nrights. Yet neither argue for any systematic reform of broader\nAmerican culture or politics. In this they are essentially\nconservative. Therefore, rather unsurprisingly, these centrists are\nattacked from both sides. Sullivan, for example, has been criticized\nat length both by queer theorists (e.g., Phelan, 2001) and natural law\ntheorists (e.g., George, 1999a).\n\nYet as the foregoing also clearly shows, the policy and legal debates\nsurrounding homosexuality involve fundamental issues of morality and\njustice. Perhaps most centrally of all, they cut to issues of personal\nidentity and self-definition. Hence there is another, and even deeper,\nset of reasons for the polarization that marks these debates.\n",
