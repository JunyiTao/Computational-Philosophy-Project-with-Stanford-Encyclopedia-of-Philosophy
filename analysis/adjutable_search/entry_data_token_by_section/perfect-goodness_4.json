Is necessary perfect goodness possible?\n\nSuppose that it is allowed that there is no obstacle to the coherence\nof the notion that God is perfectly good. Whatever the morally\nrelevant reasons that bear on divine agency, that agency is perfectly\nresponsive to those reasons. As we saw above, it is standard within\nperfect being theology to conclude from the fact that exhibiting some\nfeature is a great-making feature that necessarily exhibiting that\nfeature is a great-making feature as well. As we also saw, an\nimpediment to this reasoning would be the incoherence of exhibiting\nthat feature necessarily. So we might ask whether there is any such\nimpediment to holding that God is necessarily perfectly morally\ngood.\n",
