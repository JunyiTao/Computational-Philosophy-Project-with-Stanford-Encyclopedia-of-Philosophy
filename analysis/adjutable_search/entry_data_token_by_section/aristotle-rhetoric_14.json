    "main_text": "The Enthymeme || Formal Requirements\n6.2 Formal Requirements\n\nIn general, Aristotle regards deductive arguments as a set of\npropositions in which some sentences are premises and one is the\nconclusion, and the inference from the premises to the conclusion is\nguaranteed by the premises alone. Since enthymemes in the proper sense\nare expected to be deductive arguments, the minimal requirement for\nthe formulation of enthymemes is that they have to display the\npremise-conclusion structure of deductive arguments. This is why\nenthymemes have to include a statement as well as a kind of reason for\nthe given statement. Typically this reason is given in a conditional\n\u2018if\u2019-clause or a causal \u2018since\u2019- or\n\u2018for\u2019-clause. Examples of the former, conditional type\nare: \u201cIf not even the gods know everything, human beings can\nhardly do so.\u201d \u201cIf the war is the cause of present evils,\nthings should be set right by making peace.\u201d Examples of the\nlatter, causal type are: \u201cOne should not be educated, for one\nought not be envied (and educated people are usually envied).\u201d\n\u201cShe has given birth, for she has milk.\u201d Aristotle\nstresses that the proposition \u201cThere is no man among us who is\nfree\u201d taken by itself is a maxim, but becomes an enthymeme as\nsoon as it is used together with a reason such as \u201cfor all are\nslaves of money or of chance (and no slave of money or chance is\nfree).\u201d Sometimes the required reason may even be implicit, as\ne.g. in the proposition \u201cAs a mortal, do not cherish immortal\nanger\u201d the reason why one should not cherish mortal anger is\nimplicitly given in the term \u201cimmortal,\u201d which alludes to\nthe rule that it is not appropriate for mortal beings to have such an\nattitude.\n",
