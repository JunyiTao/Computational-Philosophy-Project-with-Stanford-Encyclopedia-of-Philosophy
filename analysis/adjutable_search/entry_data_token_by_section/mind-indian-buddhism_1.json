    "main_text": "History of the Issue || The Soteriological Dimension of the Not-Self Doctrine\n1.2 The Soteriological Dimension of the Not-Self Doctrine\n\n\nIn espousing the doctrine of not-self with its aggregated view of \npersons, the Buddha claims to be offering a solution to the problem \nof human suffering. Not only is the idea of a permanent self a \nconceptual fiction, but adopting such a view leads to grasping after \nnotions such as \u2018I,\u2019 \u2018me,\u2019 and \n\u2018mine\u2019 with deleterious effects for our psychological \nwell being: attachment to such a fictional \u2018I\u2019 is the \nroot cause of a range of negative emotions, including selfishness, \ncraving, hatred, conceit, and ill-will. These negative emotions, in \nturn, fuel the general feeling of unsatisfactoriness that pervades \nthe unenlightened human condition, and ultimately are responsible for\nall the troubles that ordinarily afflict our world. The not-self \ndoctrine offers not merely an enlightened metaphysical perspective on\nthe ultimate nature of things, but also an effective remedy for \neradicating ignorance and achieving nirv\u0101\u1e47a, the \nsummum bonum of the Buddhist path and the antithesis of \ncyclical existence (with the caveat that Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist \ntraditions generally place less emphasis on \nnirv\u0101\u1e47a, focusing instead on the enlightened and \ncompassionate attitude of the Buddhist saint or \n\u2018bodhisattva\u2019).\n",
