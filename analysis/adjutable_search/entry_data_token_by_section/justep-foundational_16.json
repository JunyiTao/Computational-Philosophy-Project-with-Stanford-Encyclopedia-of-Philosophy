    "main_text": "Objections to Externalist Versions of Foundationalism || A Challenge to Necessity: The New Evil Demon Problem\n8. The Problem of Easy Knowledge\n\nWe end by presenting the \u201cproblem of easy knowledge\u201d that\nhas been raised against both internalist and externalist alternatives\nto classical foundationalism (see Cohen 2002 for an initial\nformulation of the problem). The problem as presented there has two\nmain forms. The first involves cases of deductive closure. Suppose, to\nuse an example from Cohen (2002), that I am looking to acquire a red\ntable for my room and do not want to end up with a table that only\nlooks red\u2014e.g., a white table illuminated by red lights. Suppose\nthat upon looking at a particular table I find that it seems red to\nme. If phenomenal conservatism is true, then I can arrive at\nknowledge, or at least justified belief, by the following simple\ninference:\n\nThis table is red. (Formed on the basis of perception.)\nIf this table is red then it is not a white table illuminated by\nred lights.\nSo, this table is not a white table illuminated by red\nlights.\n\n\nThe same goes for the following inference:\n\nI have a hand. (Formed on the basis of a perception.)\nIf I have a hand, then I am not a handless brain in a vat being\nfed illusory experiences of hands.\nSo, I am not a handless brain in a vat being fed illusory\nexperiences of hands.\n\n\nThe problem is that it seems implausible that I could come to be\njustified in believing\u2014let alone know\u2014that the table is\nnot a white table illuminated by red lights merely on the\nbasis of its looking or seeming to be red. Of course, I may and often\ndo have independent reasons to trust that the colors of tables are\nnormally the way they look (colored lights are rare, I don\u2019t\nnotice any such lights, etc.), and the above argument makes no mention\nof that. But given phenomenal conservatism or dogmatism, a perceptual\nseeming alone would confer justification for beliefs of the form (1)\nin the absence of defeaters, whether or not one had good independent\nreasons to take the seeming to be trustworthy. Similarly, given\nreliabilism, a reliable perceptual process alone would confer\njustification for beliefs of form (1) in the absence of defeaters. The\nsame applies to the second inference: it is implausible that I could\ncome to be justified in believing that I am not a handless\nbrain-in-a-vat that merely seems to have hands on the basis of a\nperception or perceptual seeming that I have hands.\n\nIt is difficult to see how these views can deny that (3) could be\njustified in this way. Let\u2019s make this explicit: suppose that in\neach case (1) is indeed noninferentially justified for me on the basis\nof the corresponding seeming or reliable perceptual process, that I\nknow the obvious entailment (2) a priori, and that on the basis of\nthis I infer (3). Suppose also that we accept the following\nintuitively plausible principle of closure: if S is justified\nin believing that P, knows that P entails that\nQ, and infers on the basis of this that Q, then\nS is justified in believing that Q. (This is a\nprinciple that phenomenal conservatives and dogmatists themselves tend\nto accept. A few externalists, such as Dretske (1970) and Nozick\n(1981) deny the closure principle at work in the objection, but many\nexternalists are reluctant to deny that something like it holds, for\nthey do not want to deny that we could be justified in inferring (3)\nfrom (1).) It then follows that I am justified in believing (3). The\nobjector who uses this against phenomenal conservatism or reliabilism\ntakes the lesson here to be that mere seemings or reliable processes\n(respectively) cannot be a source of foundational or noninferential\njustification. Justification can\u2019t be that easy.\n\nThe problem of easy knowledge (or easy justification) comes in a\nsecond form as well: phenomenal conservatism and reliabilism allow one\nto acquire justification in the reliability of one\u2019s perceptual\nappearances in a way that appears to be illegitimate: by relying on\nthose very appearances themselves. If phenomenal conservatism is true,\nthen I can arrive at knowledge or at least justified belief in the\nreliability of my apparent perceptions in the following way:\n\n\nP. (Formed on the basis of a perceptual seeming that\nP)\nIt seems to me that P. (Formed by introspection)\nQ. (Formed on the basis of a perceptual seeming that\nQ)\nIt seems to me that Q. (Formed by introspection)\netc\u2026\n\n\nTherefore (probably), my perceptual seemings are true.\n\n\nGiven some plausible principle of justification by induction, I can\ninfer from the premises that my perceptual seemings are (probably)\nreliable. The problem is that it is intuitively implausible that I\ncould come to acquire justification for the reliability of my seemings\nby relying on the very seemings whose reliability I am attempting to\njustify. But it\u2019s not clear how the phenomenal conservative can\ndeny that this is a legitimate way to acquire justification in the\nreliability of one\u2019s seemings.\n\nExternalists also seem vulnerable to the second form of the problem of\neasy knowledge. They must apparently allow that a circular\ntrack-record argument could provide justification for belief in the\nreliability or trustworthiness of fundamental sources of belief. For\nexample, the reliabilist can rely on perception to justify the\nreliability of perception, memory to justify the reliability of\nmemory. And it seems implausible that one could acquire justification\nfor the reliability of such sources in this way (see Vogel 2008b for\nan argument against reliabilism along these lines).\n\nOne possible reply is to grant that such arguments are\nquestion-begging and epistemically useless if presented to someone who\ndoubts the reliability or trustworthiness of such seemings or apparent\nperceptions, but hold that it can still provide a subject who lacks\nthat doubt with justification. While the argument is question-begging\nagainst the skeptic, that is no reason to deny that one could, in the\nabsence of defeaters, acquire knowledge or justification on the basis\nof such arguments (Pryor 2004; Markie 2005; Bergmann 2008). However,\nsome object that such arguments remain intuitively\nproblematic\u2014the arguments seem not to justify at all, whether or\nnot they should persuade skeptics. (Cohen 2005; see also Vogel 2008a:\n539\u201342, for further examples of cases for which dogmatism allows\nsubjects to have justification that they really lack).\n\nOne might begin to wonder whether the problem of easy knowledge is a\nproblem for all foundationalist views if it is a problem for\nany. Indeed, some have argued that classical foundationalists are in\nno better a position than phenomenal conservatives and externalists\nwith respect to the problem, for they too will have to allow that one\ncould rely on acquaintance with facts to justify the existence and\ntrustworthiness of acquaintance. First, consider a parallel case of\ndeductive closure:\n\n\nThis is a pain. (Formed on the basis of acquaintance)\nIf this is a pain, then it is not a mere itch that I am mistaking\nfor a pain.\nSo, this is not a mere itch that I am mistaking for a pain.\n\n\nAnd a parallel case of circularity:\n\nP. (Formed on the basis of my acquaintance with the fact\nthat P)\nI am acquainted with the fact that P. (Formed on the\nbasis of my acquaintance with the fact that I am acquainted with the\nfact that P)\nQ. (Formed on the basis of my acquaintance with the fact\nthat Q)\nI am acquainted with the fact that Q. (Formed on the\nbasis of my acquaintance with the fact that I am acquainted with the\nfact that Q.)\netc.\n\n\nTherefore (probably), acquaintance is a source of true beliefs.\n\n\nClassical foundationalists might respond that the problem is not one\nof permitting some source to justify propositions about itself or its\nepistemic credentials. The problem is that some alleged sources make\nthe justification implausibly easy. Classical foundationalism does\nnot; the intuition that the knowledge or justification acquired is\nimplausibly easy or unsatisfying in the argument forms just presented\nis absent or at least much weaker (see Fumerton 2006). The problem\nthat classical foundationalism faces is that it makes justification\ntoo hard, not too easy.\n",
