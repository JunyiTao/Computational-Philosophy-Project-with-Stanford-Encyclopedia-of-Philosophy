    "main_text": "Origins of the Doctrine\n1. Origins of the Doctrine\n\n\nThe phrase methodische Individualismus was actually coined by\nWeber\u2019s student, Joseph Schumpeter, in his 1908 work Das Wesen und\nder Hauptinhalt der theoretischen National\u00f6konomie. The\nfirst use of the term \u201cmethodological individualism\u201d in\nEnglish was again by Schumpeter in his 1909 Quarterly Journal of\nEconomics paper, \u201cOn the Concept of Social Value\u201d\n(see Udehn 2001, 214). However, the theoretical elaboration of the\ndoctrine is due to Weber, and Schumpeter uses the term as a way of\nreferring to the Weberian view.\n\n\nIn Economy and Society, Weber articulates the central precept\nof methodological individualism in the following way: When discussing\nsocial phenomena, we often talk about various \u201csocial\ncollectivities, such as states, associations, business corporations,\nfoundations, as if they were individual persons\u201d(Weber 1922,\n13).  Thus we talk about them having plans, performing actions,\nsuffering losses, and so forth. The doctrine of methodological\nindividualism does not take issue with these ordinary ways of\nspeaking, it merely stipulates that \u201cin sociological work these\ncollectivities must be treated as solely the resultants and modes of\norganization of the particular acts of individual persons, since these\nalone can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively\nunderstandable action\u201d (Weber 1922, 13).\n\n\nFor Weber, the commitment to methodological individualism is very\nclosely related to the commitment to verstehende (or\ninterpretive) patterns of explanation in sociology. The reason for\nprivileging individual action in sociological explanation is that only\naction is \u201csubjectively understandable.\u201d Weber reserves\nthe term \u201caction\u201d to refer to the subset of human behavior\nthat is motivated by linguistically formulated or\n\u201cmeaningful\u201d mental states. (Generally speaking: coughing\nis behavior, apologizing afterwards is action.) Updating the\nterminology somewhat, we can say that the defining characteristic of\nan action is that it is motivated by a mental state with propositional\ncontent, i.e., an intentional state. The importance of action for\nWeber is that we have interpretive access to it, by virtue of our\ncapacity to understand the agent\u2019s underlying motive. This permits the\nsocial scientist to \u201caccomplish something which is never\nattainable in the natural sciences, namely the subjective\nunderstanding of the action of the component individuals\u201d (Weber\n1922, 15). Action-theoretic explanation is central to\nsocial-scientific analysis, therefore, because without knowing\nwhy people do what they do, we do not really understand why\nany of the more large-scale phenomena with which they are embroiled\noccur.\n\n\nThus methodological individualism is a slightly misleading term, since\nthe goal is not to privilege the individual over the collective in\nsocial-scientific explanation, but rather to privilege the\naction-theoretic level of explanation. This privileging of the\naction-theoretic level is methodological because it is imposed by the\nstructure of interpretive social science, where the goal is to provide\nan understanding of social phenomena. Actions can be\nunderstood in a way that other social phenomena cannot, precisely\nbecause they are motivated by intentional states. Yet only individuals\npossess intentional states, and so the methodological privileging of\nactions entails the methodological privileging of individuals. Thus\nthe \u201cindividualism\u201d in methodological individualism is\nmore a byproduct of its central theoretical commitment than a\nmotivating factor. This is what defenders to the doctrine have tried\nto communicate, with greater or lesser degrees of success, by claiming\nthat it is politically or ideologically neutral.\n\n\nIt is worth emphasizing the difference between methodological\nindividualism, in Weber\u2019s sense, and the older traditions of atomism\n(or unqualified individualism) in the social sciences. Many writers\nclaim to find the origins of methodological individualism amongst\neconomists of the Austrian School (especially Carl Menger), and\ndoctrines articulated during the Methodenstreit of the 1880s\n(Udehn 2001). Others trace it back to Thomas Hobbes, and the\n\u201cresolutive-compositive\u201d method elaborated in the opening\nsections of the Leviathan (Lukes 1968, 119). Yet the\ndistinctive character of this type of atomism was summed up quite\nclearly by Hobbes, with his injunction to \u201cconsider men as if\nbut even now sprung out of the earth, and suddainly (like Mushromes)\ncome to full maturity without all kind of engagement to each\nother\u201d (1651, 8:1). The atomistic view is based upon the\nsuggestion that it is possible to develop a complete characterization\nof individual psychology that is fully pre-social, then deduce what\nwill happen when a group of individuals, so characterized, enter into\ninteraction with one another. Methodological individualism, on the\nother hand, does not involve a commitment to any particular claim\nabout the content of the intentional states that motivate\nindividuals, and thus remains open to the possibility that human\npsychology may have an irreducibly social dimension. Thus one way of\naccentuating the difference between atomism and methodological\nindividualism is to note that the former entails a complete reduction\nof sociology to psychology, whereas the latter does not.\n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that Weber\u2019s commitment to methodological\nindividualism is closely related to his more well-known methodological\ndoctrine, viz., the theory of ideal types. Historical explanation may\nmake reference to the actual content of the intentional states that\nmotivated particular historical actors, but the sociologist is\ninterested in producing much more abstract explanatory\ngeneralizations, and so cannot appeal to the specific motives of\nparticular individuals. Thus sociological theory must be based upon a\nmodel of human action. And because of the constraints that\ninterpretation imposes, this model must be a model of\nrational human action (Weber writes: \u201cit is convenient\nto treat all irrational, affectually determined elements of behavior\nas factors of deviation from a conceptually pure type of rational\naction\u201d [1922, 6].)\n\n\nThus one of the most important consequences of Weber\u2019s methodological\nindividualism is that it puts rational action theory at the core of\nsocial-scientific inquiry. This is why subsequent generations of\nsocial theorists, under Weber\u2019s influence, sought to bring about the\nmethodological unification of the social sciences by producing what\ncame to be known as a \u201cgeneral theory of action\u201d \u2013\none that would broaden the economic model of action in such a way as\nto incorporate the central action-theoretic insights of (primarily)\nsociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists. The work of Talcott\nParsons in the first half of the century was the most important in\nthis regard, with the unification movement reaching its apogee in the\ncollaborative publication in 1951 of Toward a General Theory of\nAction, co-edited by Parsons and Edward Shils. Yet shortly\nthereafter, partly due to problems with the unification program,\nParsons abandoned his commitment to both methodological individualism\nand action theory, adopting a purely systems-theoretic view. This led\nto an overall lapse in the project of producing a general theory of\naction, until it was revitalized in 1981 by the publication of\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s The Theory of Communicative\nAction.\n",
