    "main_text": "History of sortal from 1690\u20131959 || Is identity weakly sortal relative?\n3.4 Is identity weakly sortal relative?\n\nWiggins and others argue that identity is dependent on a sortal in a\nweaker sense. The criterion for the identity of sets is perhaps the\none clear and uncontroversial case: Two sets are identical, the same\nset, if and only if they have the same members. (Notice that while the\ncriterion is clear, the appeal to identity reappears with reference to\nthe members.) While it is perhaps less uncontroversial, my car is the\nsame as the car I owned five years ago even though the oil, tires,\nbattery and have been replaced; the car can remain the same even\nthough some parts change. My friend is the same person as he was five\nyears ago in spite of many natural changes in the molecules composing\nhis body, some dental fillings, an artificial hip and a new cornea\nlens. Two natural numbers are the same if they gave the same\nsuccessor, and two real numbers are identical iff they bear all of the\nsame order relations to the other numbers, =3.14\u2026. Notice that\nin all of these cases appeal to identity recurs with reference to\nparts (whether body or automotive) or relations to other objects of\nthe same category. \n\nThe weak sortal relativity claim consists of saying that the identity\nrelation for sets is different from those for numbers, which is\ndifferent from those for people and artifacts like cars, and numbers.\nFor sets it involves members of whatever kind, for numbers relations\nto numbers and for persons and artifacts continuity of life and of\nfunction. For abstract non-mathematical things the relation is even\nless clear\u2014the question when two ideas are the same idea is\noften only settled in a court case about copyright or patent\ninfringement. \n\nIn other words, there are two conceptions of identity: On one the\ngeneral identity relation is pieced together from the different\nidentity relations for different categories of things. For a\nand b to be identical is for them to be the same person or the\nsame number or the same artifact or \u2026. On the other conception,\nthere is a general notion of identity, perhaps given by the identity\nlaws discussed in\n Section 3.2,\n and the specific ones are ways of instantiating that relation. The\nbest argument for the first view is that the pieces seem too diverse\nto be parts of the same general relation. The best argument for the\nsecond is that as we move from domain to domain, and even invent new\nones, the general identity scheme guides our development of an\nunderstanding of the more local notion. For a detailed analysis of\nWiggins\u2019 claims see Snowdon 2009.\n",
