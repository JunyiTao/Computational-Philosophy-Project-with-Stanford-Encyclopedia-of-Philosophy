Such information can be of\nsignificant interest to policy makers, who might choose to implement\npolicies that push toward some future scenarios and away from others,\nand to many other decision makers as well (e.g., insurance companies\ndeciding which policies to offer). Climate models have emerged as an\nimportant tool for making projections of future conditions. For a\ngiven scenario, it is common to make an ensemble of\nprojections using different climate models or model versions; this is\nmotivated in part by uncertainty about how to construct a climate\nmodel that can deliver highly accurate projections (Parker 2006; Betz 2009). This uncertainty in turn stems both from limited theoretical\nunderstanding of some processes operating within the climate system as\nwell as from limited computing power, which constrains how existing\nknowledge can be implemented in models (see the discussion of\nparameterization in\n Section 4.2).\n\nDifferent types of ensemble study explore the consequences of\ndifferent sources of uncertainty in modeling. A\nmulti-model ensemble (MME) study probes structural\nuncertainty, which is uncertainty about the form that modeling\nequations should take as well as how those equations should be solved.\nAn example of an MME study is the Coupled Model Intercomparison\nProject Version 5 (CMIP5), which produced projections using a few\ndozen climate models developed at different modeling centers around\nthe world (see Flato et al. 2013: Table 9.1). A perturbed-physics\nensemble (PPE) consists of multiple versions of the same climate\nmodel, where the versions differ in the numerical values assigned to\none or more parameters within the model. Examples of studies employing\nPPEs include the climateprediction.net project (Stainforth et al.\n2005) and the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) project (Murphy et al.\n2009). PPEs probe parameter uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty\nabout the numerical values that should be assigned to parameters\nwithin a given model structure. In an initial condition\nensemble (ICE), the same model or model version is assigned\ndifferent initial conditions. ICEs can probe initial condition\nuncertainty, which is uncertainty about the initial model state\nfrom which simulations should be launched, and they are often used in\ncombination with one of the other two types of ensemble (see Werndl forthcoming for further discussion).\n\nWhen it comes to interpreting ensemble projections, a range of views\nand methodologies have emerged. At one end of the spectrum, there are\nstatistical methodologies used to infer probabilities (of future\nchanges in climate) from ensemble results. For instance, some MME\nstudies have adopted what amounts to a \u201ctruth-plus-error\u201d\nframework: probabilities are estimated by treating ensemble members as\nrandom draws from a distribution of possible models centered on truth\n(e.g., Tebaldi et al. 2005). The performance of today\u2019s MMEs on\npast data, however, suggests that they are not centered on truth\n(Knutti et al. 2010a). An alternative\n\u201cstatistically-indistinguishable\u201d framework allows for the\nestimation of probabilities by assuming that ensemble members and\ntruth (i.e., perfect observations of future conditions) are drawn from\nthe same statistical distribution. Examining past data, Annan and\nHargreaves (2010) find this assumption to roughly hold for one\nprominent MME (the CMIP3 ensemble), at least for some variables.\nBishop and Abramowitz (2013), however, argue that results from\ntoday\u2019s MMEs lack some statistical properties that should be\npresent if the assumption of indistinguishability is accurate. They\npropose an alternative \u201creplicate-Earth\u201d framework, which\ninvolves post-processing MME projections so that they display those\ndesired statistical properties; Bishop and Abramowitz do not seem to\ninsist, however, that the post-processed distribution be considered a\nprobability distribution. Bayesian methodologies have also been\ndeveloped. The UKCP09 project, for example, used a Bayesian PPE\nmethodology to produce probabilistic climate change projections out to\n2100 at a fine spatiotemporal resolution for the United Kingdom\n(Murphy et al. 2009). That methodology treated parameter uncertainty\nas uncertainty about which model was the best (on given metrics of\nperformance) in a given model class, and attempted to account for the\ndifference between the best model and a perfect model with the help of\nresults from an MME (Rougier 2007; Sexton et al. 2012). \n\nScientists and philosophers have raised a number of criticisms of\nmethods that infer probabilities from ensemble results. As implied\nabove, some lines of criticism cite evidence that the statistical\nassumptions underlying the studies are not met. Others argue that\nuncertainty about future climate change is deeper than precise\nprobabilities imply, either because of challenges associated with\nquantifying structural model uncertainty (e.g., Stainforth et al.\n2007; \nHillerbrand 2014; Parker 2014a) or, relatedly, because the possible future states of\nthe climate system (i.e., the outcome space) is itself uncertain\n(Katzav et al. 2012). In other words, these critics contend that\nprobabilistic uncertainty estimates have a false precision and, in that sense, are misleading about the actual\nstate of knowledge. Frigg et al. (2013, 2014, 2015a) argue that, for\nPPE studies like UKCP09, such probabilities are also likely to be\nmisleading in a different sense, namely, because they differ markedly\nfrom the probabilities that would be obtained from a model with no\nstructural error. They illustrate that, for nonlinear systems, even a\nsmall amount of structural model error can give rise to very\nmisleading probabilities\u2014a consequence they dub the\n\u201chawkmoth effect\u201d (taking inspiration from the\n\u201cbutterfly effect\u201d, which relates to initial condition\nerror; see also Mayo-Wilson 2015, Lawhead forthcoming). Winsberg and\nGoodwin (2016), however, contend that more work is needed to establish\nthat the hawkmoth effect is as devastating for probabilistic climate\nprojection as Frigg et al. claim (see also Goodwin & Winsberg\n2016).\n\nSome of these critics of probabilistic approaches advocate a very\ndifferent interpretation of results from today\u2019s ensemble\nprojection studies, according to which the projections indicate\nchanges that are (merely) plausible or possible in\nlight of current understanding. Stainforth et al. (2007), for example,\nsuggest that the range of projections produced using state-of-the-art\nclimate models constitutes a \u201cnon-discountable envelope\u201d\nof future changes, a set of possible changes that should not be\ndisregarded; this does not imply that changes outside the envelope are\ndiscountable. Likewise, Katzav (2014) argues that climate change\nprojections can often be interpreted as indicating real\npossibilities: \n\n\na state of affairs in a target domain is\u2026a real possibility\nrelative to time t if and only if (a) its realisation is\ncompatible with the basic way things are in the target domain over the\nperiod during which it might be realised and (b) our knowledge at\nt does not exclude its realisation over that period. (2014:\n236) \n\n\nBetz (2015), however, argues that even a possibilistic interpretation\nof ensemble results may be hard to justify, since it is difficult to\nshow that contrary-to-fact assumptions employed in climate models do\nnot lead to projections that are inconsistent with background\nknowledge; on his view, though not on Katzav\u2019s, this consistency\nis necessary for projections to indicate serious possibilities. Part\nof the disagreement here thus hinges on what it takes for something to\nbe a serious/real possibility.\n\nThere are also intermediate views. One such view sees today\u2019s\nensemble projection studies as imperfect investigations of\nuncertainty, whose results should be considered by experts alongside\nall other available information when reaching conclusions about future\nclimate change; those conclusions might take various forms, depending\non the variable under consideration (see, e.g., Kandlikar et al. 2005;\nMastrandrea et al. 2010). For example, in its recent\nassessment reports, the IPCC relied on ensemble modeling results,\nbackground knowledge and expert judgment to arrive at\n\u201clikely\u201d ranges for changes in near-surface global mean\ntemperature under different scenarios; the experts judged it to be\nlikely (i.e., probability >0.66) that the temperature\nchange would fall within the 5% to 95% range of the CMIP5 ensemble\nresults (Collins et al. 2013: 1031). For the moderate emission\nscenario known as RCP6.0, for instance, the conclusion was that the\nglobal mean temperature during 2081\u20132100 would likely\nbe between 1.4 and 3.1 degrees Celsius warmer than during\n1986\u20132005 (ibid.). The IPCC thus asserted more than that the\nchanges projected by the CMIP5 ensemble were possibilities, but they\ndid not go so far as to assign a single, full probability density\nfunction over temperature change values.\n\nIntertwined with the issue of ensemble interpretation is the issue of weighting, i.e., \nwhether to assign greater weight to some projections than others.\nThis is part and parcel of some methods, but in MME studies it has\nbeen common to give equal weight to participating models, as the IPCC approach\nillustrates. This is sometimes referred to as \u201cmodel\ndemocracy\u201d or \u201cone-model one-vote\u201d (Knutti 2010).\nPart of the original motivation for model democracy was the difficulty\nof determining which of the state-of-the-art models included in MMEs\nwould give the most accurate projections of future conditions (see\n Section 4.4).\n This difficulty notwithstanding, recently weighting has been\nadvocated on the grounds that, for at least some projected variables,\nthere is good reason to think that some models are more skillful than\nothers and, moreover, the one-model one-vote approach fails to take\naccount of dependence among models, i.e., of the fact that an MME can\ninclude several models that are variants of one another (Knutti et al.\n2017). A key challenge, however, is to select and combine\nrelevant metrics of performance and other criteria to assign appropriate\nweights for a given projected variable (Gleckler et al. 2008; Knutti et al. 2010b; Weigel et al. 2010). The basic\nissue of interpretation discussed above also remains, i.e., how to\ninterpret the weighted ensemble results.\n\nThere are many other philosophically-interesting questions related to\nensemble climate projection (Frame et al. 2007); just a few will be\nmentioned here. First, how can ensemble studies be designed so that\nthey probe uncertainty in desired ways? Today\u2019s MME studies do\nnot probe structural uncertainty systematically, and it is unclear\nwhat it would mean to do so; there are questions about how to define\nthe space of relevant models and how to sample it (Murphy et al. 2007). Second, how significant are robust results? Climate\nscientists often assume that agreement among projections has special\nepistemic significance\u2014e.g., that we can be substantially more\nconfident in those projected changes (Pirtle et al. 2010)\u2014but\nParker (2011) argues that it is difficult to make the case for this.\nThere are also questions about how to quantify the extent of agreement\nor robustness (see Collins et al. 2013: Box 12.1) and about what it\nmeans for ensemble members to be independent, an important factor in\ninterpreting the significance of robustness (Annan and Hargreaves\n2017). Finally, to what extent do non-epistemic values influence\nensemble results? Winsberg (2010, 2012; see also Biddle & Winsberg\n2009) identifies pathways of influence via model construction (see\n Section 3.2),\n which in turn affect probabilistic uncertainty estimates produced\nfrom ensemble results, though not necessarily in a way that raises\nconcerns about \u201cwishful thinking\u201d. Parker (2014a) suggests that this influence\nmight be dampened by representing uncertainty in coarser ways that\nalso better reflect the extent of actual uncertainty, e.g., by using\nthe IPCC imprecise probability intervals; the extent to which the value influence is escapable in practice, however, remains unclear.\n",
