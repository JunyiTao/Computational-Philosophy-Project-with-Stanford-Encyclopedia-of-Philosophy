The main\nquestion here has been what makes knowledge more valuable than true\nbelief? Further such value questions might be asked. For instance,\nwhat if anything makes understanding more valuable than knowledge? Or,\nif understanding is a species of knowledge, what if anything makes it\nmore valuable than knowledge that does not qualify as understanding?\nAnd what makes wisdom especially epistemically valuable?\n\nAnswers to these questions tend to home in on properties either of the\ncontent or of the cognizer. For example, there is a long tradition in\nthe philosophy of science on the nature of scientific explanation. In\nthis tradition, explanations provide understanding by communicating\nknowledge of causes (Lipton 1991; Salmon 1984; Khalifa & Gadomski\n2013; Turri 2015b). By contrast, epistemologists, especially virtue\nepistemologists, have tended to argue that understanding is a special\nstatus that arises from acts of intellectual virtue. For instance,\nPritchard (2016b) argues that understanding arises from \u201cseeing\nit for oneself\u201d, which manifests the virtue of intellectual\nautonomy. Stephen Grimm (2006) argues that understanding is a special\nkind of knowledge that arises from \u201cgrasping\u201d, a\ndistinctive psychological act that manifests intellectual virtue.\nCarter and Gordon (2014a,b) argue that objectual understanding, in\nparticular, has a special value knowledge lacks, and further that this\nkind of understanding is needed in order to explain why certain\ntraits, such as open-mindedness, are intellectual virtues. And on\nZagzebski\u2019s view, understanding is closely tied to mastery of an\nart or skill, does not pertain to discrete propositions but to\npatterns or systems, and consequently takes a nonpropositional object.\nUnderstanding does not result from mere acquisition of information, as\ncan propositional knowledge. She thinks of understanding as \u201cthe\nstate of comprehension of nonpropositional structures of\nreality\u201d (Zagzebski 2001: 242). She also conjectures that we can\ndefine understanding analogously to how she defined knowledge. The\nmain difference would be in the relevant virtues that produce the\ndifferent states. Whereas knowledge derives from virtues that aim at\ntruth, understanding derives at least partly from different virtues,\nspecial ones hitherto \u201cunanalyzed, even unrecognized\u201d\n(Zagzebski 2001: 248).\n\nLooking beyond even understanding, Zagzebski further hopes that one\nday epistemologists will turn their attention to wisdom. Further, she\nclaims, VE makes it easier to \u201crecover\u201d interest in and\nanalyze understanding and wisdom. For more on wisdom and its potential\nconnection to the virtue of epistemic humility, see Ryan (2014).\n",
