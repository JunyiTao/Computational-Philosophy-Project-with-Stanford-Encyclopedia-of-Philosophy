    "main_text": "Contemporary Ethical Concerns about Social Networking Services || Democracy, Freedom and Social Networking Services in the Public Sphere\n3.4 Democracy, Freedom and Social Networking Services in the Public Sphere\n\nAs is the case with privacy, identity, community and friendship on\nSNS, ethical debates about the impact of SNS on civil discourse,\nfreedom and democracy in the public sphere must be seen as extensions\nof a broader discussion about the political implications of the\nInternet, one that predates Web 2.0 standards. Much of the literature\non this subject focuses on the question of whether the Internet\nencourages or hampers the free exercise of deliberative public reason,\nin a manner informed by J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s (1992/1998)\naccount of discourse ethics and deliberative democracy in the public\nsphere (Ess 1996 and 2005b; Dahlberg 2001; Bohman 2008). A related\ntopic of concern is SNS fragmentation of the public sphere by\nencouraging the formation of \u2018echo chambers\u2019 and\n\u2018filter bubbles\u2019: informational silos for like-minded\nindividuals who deliberately shield themselves from exposure to\nalternative views. Early worries that such insularity would promote\nextremism and the reinforcement of ill-founded opinions, while also\npreventing citizens of a democracy from recognizing their shared\ninterests and experiences (Sunstein 2008), have unfortunately proven\nto be well-founded (as noted in section 2.3.2). Early optimism that\nSNS would facilitate popular revolutions resulting in the overthrow of\nauthoritarian regimes (Marturano 2011; Frick and Oberprantacher 2011)\nhave likewise given way to the darker reality that SNS are perhaps\neven more easily used as tools to popularize authoritarian and\ntotalitarian movements, or foster genocidal impulses, as in the use of\nFacebook to drive violence against the Rohingya minority in Myanmar\n(BBC 2018).\n\nWhen SNS in particular are considered in light of these questions,\nsome distinctive considerations arise. First, sites like Facebook and\nTwitter (as opposed to narrower SNS utilities such as LinkedIn)\nfacilitate the sharing of, and exposure to, an extremely diverse range\nof types of discourse. On any given day on Facebook a user\nmay encounter in her NewsFeed a link to an article in a respected\npolitical magazine followed by a video of a cat in a silly costume,\nfollowed by a link to a new scientific study, followed by a lengthy\nstatus update someone has posted about their lunch, followed by a\nphoto of a popular political figure overlaid with a clever and\nsubversive caption. Vacation photos are mixed in with political rants,\ninvitations to cultural events, birthday reminders and data-driven\ngraphs created to undermine common political, moral or economic\nbeliefs. Thus while a user has a tremendous amount of liberty to\nchoose which forms of discourse to pay closer attention to, and tools\nwith which to hide or prioritize the posts of certain members of her\nnetwork, the sheer diversity of the private and public concerns of her\nfellows would seem to offer at least some measure of protection\nagainst the extreme insularity and fragmentation of discourse that is\nincompatible with the public sphere.\n\nYet in practice, the function of hidden platform algorithms can defeat\nthis diversity. Trained on user behavior to optimize for engagement\nand other metrics that advertisers and platform companies associate\nwith their profit, these algorithms can ensure that I experience only\na pale shadow of the true diversity of my social network, seeing at\nthe top of my feed only those posts that I am most likely to find\nsubjectively rewarding to engage with. If, for example, I support the\nBlack Lives Matter movement, and tend to close the app in frustration\nand disappointment whenever I see BLM denigrated by someone I consider\na friend, the platform algorithm can easily learn this association and\noptimize my experience for one that is more conducive to retaining my\npresence. It is important to note, however, that in this case the\neffect is an interaction between the algorithm and my own behavior.\nHow much responsibility for echo chambers and resulting polarization\nor insularity falls upon users, and how much on the designers of\nalgorithms that track and amplify our expressed preferences?\n\nPhilosophers of technology often speak of the affordances or\ngradients of particular technologies in given contexts\n(Vallor 2010) insofar as they make certain patterns of use more\nattractive or convenient for users (while not rendering alternative\npatterns impossible). Thus while I can certainly seek out\nposts that will cause me discomfort or anxiety, the platform gradient\nwill not be designed to facilitate such experiences. Yet it is not\nobvious if or when it should be designed to do so. As Alexis\nElder notes (2020), civic discourse on social media can be furthered\nrather than inhibited by prudent use of tools enabling disconnection.\nAdditionally, a platform affordance that makes a violent white\nsupremacist feel accepted, valued, safe and respected in their social\nmilieu (precisely for their expressed attitudes and beliefs\nin white supremacist violence) facilitates harm to others, in a way\nthat a platform affordance that makes an autistic person or a\ntransgender woman feel accepted, valued, safe and respected for who\nthey are, does not. Fairness and equity in SNS platform design do not\nentail neutrality. Ethics explicitly demands non-neutrality\nbetween harm and nonharm, between justice and injustice. But ethics\nalso requires epistemic anchoring in reality. Thus even if my own\nattitudes and beliefs harm no one, I may still have a normative\nepistemic duty to avoid the comfort of a filter bubble. Do SNS\nplatforms have a duty to keep their algorithms from helping me into\none? In truth, those whose identities are historically marginalized\nwill rarely have the luxury of the filter bubble option; online and\noffline worlds consistently offer stark reminders of their\nmarginalization. So how do SNS designers, users, and regulators\nmitigate the deleterious political and epistemic effects of filter\nbubble phenomena without making platforms more inhospitable to\nvulnerable groups than they already are?\n\nOne must also ask whether SNS can skirt the dangers of a plebiscite\nmodel of democratic discourse, in which minority voices are dispersed\nand drowned out by the many. Certainly, compared to the\n\u2018one-to-many\u2019 channels of communication favored by\ntraditional media, SNS facilitate a \u2018many-to-many\u2019 model\nof communication that appears to lower the barriers to participation\nin civic discourse for everyone, including the marginalized. However,\nSNS lack the institutional structures necessary to ensure that\nminoritized voices enjoy not only free, but substantively\nequal access to the deliberative function of the public\nsphere.\n\nWe must also consider the quality of informational exchanges on SNS\nand the extent to which they promote a genuinely dialogical\nand deliberative public sphere marked by the exercise of\ncritical rationality. SNS norms tend to privilege brevity and\nimmediate impact over substance and depth in communication; Vallor\n(2012) suggests that this bodes poorly for the cultivation of those\ncommunicative virtues essential to a flourishing public sphere. This\nworry is only reinforced by empirical data suggesting that SNS\nperpetuate the \u2018Spiral of Silence\u2019 phenomenon that results\nin the passive suppression of divergent views on matters of important\npolitical or civic concern (Hampton et. al. 2014). In a related\ncritique, Frick and Oberprantacher (2011) claim that the ability of\nSNS to facilitate public \u2018sharing\u2019 can obscure the deep\nambiguity between sharing as \u201ca promising, active participatory\nprocess\u201d and \u201cinterpassive, disjointed acts of having\ntrivia shared.\u201d (2011, 22)\n\nThere remains a notable gap online between the prevalence of\ndemocratic discourse and debate\u2014which require only the open\nvoicing of opinions and reasons, respectively\u2014and the relative\nabsence of democratic deliberation, which requires the joint\nexercise of collective intentions, cooperation and compromise as well\nas a shared sense of reality on which to act. The greatest moral\nchallenges of our time\u2014responding to the climate change crisis,\ndeveloping sustainable patterns of economic and social life, managing\nglobal threats to public health\u2014aren\u2019t going to be solved\nby ideological warfare but by deliberative, coordinated exercise of\npublic wisdom. Today\u2019s social media platforms are great for\ncultivating the former; for the latter, not so much.\n\nAnother vital issue for online democracy relates to the contentious\ndebate emerging on social media platforms about the extent to which\ncontroversial or unpopular speech ought to be tolerated or punished by\nprivate actors, especially when the consequences manifest in\ntraditional offline contexts and spaces such as the university. For\nexample, the norms of academic freedom in the U.S. were greatly\ndestabilized by the \u2018Salaita Affair\u2019 (in which a tenured\njob offer by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to Steven\nSalaita was withdrawn on the basis of his tweets criticizing Israel)\nand several other cases in which academics were censured or otherwise\npunished by their institutions as a result of their controversial\nsocial media posts (Protevi 2018). Yet how should we treat a post by a\nprofessor that expresses a desire to sleep with their students, or\nthat expresses their doubts about the intelligence of women, or the\nintegrity of students of a particular nationality? It remains to be\nseen what equilibrium can be found between moral accountability and\nfree expression in communities increasingly mediated by SNS\ncommunications. A related debate concerns the ethical and social value\nof the kind of social media acts of moral policing frequently derided\nas insincere or performative \u2018virtue signaling.\u2019 To what\nextent are social media platforms a viable stage for moral\nperformances, and are such performances merely performative?\nAre they inherently \u2018grandstanding\u2019 abuses of moral\ndiscourse (Tosi and Warmke 2020), or can they in fact be positive\nforces for social progress and reform (Levy 2020, Westra 2021)?\n\nIt also remains to be seen to what extent civic discourse and activism\non SNS will continue to be manipulated or compromised by the\ncommercial interests that currently own and manage the technical\ninfrastructure. This concern is driven by the growing economic and\npolitical influence of companies in the technology sector, what\nLuciano Floridi (2015b) calls \u2018grey power,\u2019 and the\npotentially disenfranchising and disempowering effects of an economic\nmodel in which most users play a passive role (Floridi 2015a). Indeed,\nthe relationship between social media users and service providers has\nbecome increasingly contentious, as users struggle to demand more\nprivacy, better data security and more effective protections from\nonline harassment in an economic context where they have little or no\ndirect bargaining power (Zuboff 2019).\n\nThis imbalance was powerfully illustrated by the revelation in 2014\nthat Facebook researchers had quietly conducted psychological\nexperiments on users without their knowledge, manipulating their moods\nby altering the balance of positive or negative items in their News\nFeeds (Goel 2014). The study added yet another dimension to existing\nconcerns about the ethics and validity of social science research that\nrelies on SNS-generated data (Buchanan and Zimmer 2012), concerns that\ndrive an increasingly vital and contested area of research ethics\n(Woodfield 2018, franzke et al. 2020).\n\nIronically, in the power struggle between users and SNS providers,\nsocial networking platforms themselves have become the primary\nbattlefield, where users vent their collective outrage in an attempt\nto force service providers into responding to their demands. The\nresults are sometimes positive, as when Twitter users, after years of\ncomplaining, finally shamed the company in 2015 into providing better\nreporting tools for online harassment. Yet by its nature the process\nis chaotic and often controversial, as when later that year, Reddit\nusers successfully demanded the ouster of CEO Ellen Pao, under whose\nleadership Reddit had banned some of its more repugnant\n\u2018subreddit\u2019 forums (such as \u201cFat People\nHate\u201d).\n\nThe only clear consensus emerging from the considerations outlined\nhere is that if SNS are going to facilitate any enhancement of a\nHabermasian public sphere, or the civic virtues and praxes of reasoned\ndiscourse that any functioning public sphere must presuppose, then\nusers will have to actively mobilize themselves to exploit such an\nopportunity (Frick and Oberprantacher 2011). Such mobilization may\ndepend upon resisting the \u201cfalse sense of activity and\naccomplishment\u201d (Bar-Tura, 2010, 239) that may come from merely\nclicking \u2018Like\u2019 in response to acts of meaningful\npolitical speech, forwarding calls to sign petitions, or simply\n\u2018following\u2019 an outspoken social critic on Twitter whose\n\u2018tweeted\u2019 calls to action are drowned in a tide of\ncorporate announcements, celebrity product endorsements and personal\ncommentaries. Some argue that it will also require the cultivation of\nnew norms and virtues of online civic-mindedness, without which online\n\u2018democracies\u2019 will continue to be subject to the\nself-destructive and irrational tyrannies of mob behavior (Ess\n2010).\n",
