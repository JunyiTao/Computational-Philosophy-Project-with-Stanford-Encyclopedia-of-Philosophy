    "main_text": "\n\nAll of us engage in and make use of valid reasoning, but the reasoning\nwe actually perform differs in various ways from the inferences\nstudied by most (formal) logicians. Reasoning as performed by human\nbeings typically involves information obtained through more than one\nmedium. Formal logic, by contrast, has thus far been primarily\nconcerned with valid reasoning which is based on information in one\nform only, i.e., in the form of sentences. Recently, many\nphilosophers, psychologists, logicians, mathematicians, and computer\nscientists have become increasingly aware of the importance of\nmulti-modal reasoning and, moreover, much research has been undertaken\nin the area of non-symbolic, especially diagrammatic, representation\n systems.[1]\n This entry outlines the overall directions of this new research area\nand focuses on the logical status of diagrams in proofs, their\nrepresentational function and adequacy, different kinds of\ndiagrammatic systems, and the role of diagrams in human cognition.\n\n",
