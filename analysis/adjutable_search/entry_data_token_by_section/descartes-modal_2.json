    "main_text": "The Eternal Truths\n3. The Eternal Truths\n\nDescartes is infamous for his doctrine of the creation of the eternal\ntruths:\n\nYou ask me by what kind of causality God established the eternal\ntruths. I reply: by the same kind of causality as he created all\nthings, that is to say, as their efficient and total cause. (\u201cTo\n[Mersenne], 27 May 1630,\u201d AT 1:152, CSMK 25)\n\n\nOn the surface the position is baffling, especially when considered in\nconjunction with Descartes\u2019 view that God is omnipotent. The\nauthor of Fifth Objections, Pierre Gassendi, complained that\nthe view is very difficult to conceive. Descartes\u2019 reply is\ninteresting:\n\nYou say that you think it is \u2018very hard\u2019 to propose that\nthere is anything immutable and eternal apart from God. You would be\nright to think this if I was talking about existing things, or if I\nwas proposing something as immutable in the sense that its\nimmutability was independent of God. But just as the poets suppose\nthat the Fates were originally established by Jupiter, but that after\nthey were established he bound himself to abide by them, so I do not\nthink that the essences of things, and the mathematical truths which\nwe can know concerning them, are independent of God. Nevertheless I do\nthink that they are immutable and eternal, since the will and decree\nof God willed and decreed that they should be so. Whether you think\nthis is hard or easy to accept, it is enough for me that it is true.\n(Fifth Replies, AT 7:380, CSM 2:261)\n\n\nDescartes holds that each and every thing depends on God for its\nexistence and that, as things, eternal truths depend on God as well.\nOne of Gassendi\u2019s worries is that if God can do anything and\nthus can alter any item that He creates, nothing that He creates is\nimmutable.\n\nAnother reason that Descartes\u2019 view is difficult to conceive is\nthat he takes eternal truths to be necessary. That is, it is difficult\nto conceive how eternal truths could be necessary if they were created\nby a free act of God. Descartes is clear that the eternal truths are\nnecessary: he says that \u201cthe necessity of these truths does not\nsurpass our knowledge\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 6 May 1630,\u201d\nAT 1:150, CSMK 25). If eternal truths are necessary, however, it\nshould not be the case that they could have been otherwise. Yet\nDescartes\u2019 commitment to divine omnipotence appears to commit\nhim to this view:\n\nYou ask what necessitated God to create these truths; and I reply that\nhe was free to make it not true that all the radii of the circle are\nequal \u2013 just as free as he was not to create the world. And it\nis certain that these truths are no more necessarily attached to his\nessence than are other created things. (\u201cTo [Mersenne], 27 May\n1630,\u201d AT 1:152, CSMK 25)\n\n\nIt appears that something in Descartes\u2019 comments about the\neternal truths has to give. It might be that, since Descartes is\nclearly not prepared to adjust his commitment to divine omnipotence,\nhe instead has to abandon his view that they are necessary (Frankfurt\n1977; Plantinga 1980, 110\u2013113). On this interpretation,\ndeveloped and defended by Harry Frankfurt, all eternal truths are\ninherently contingent because they could have been false, and they\ncould have been false because God could have made their\ncontradictories true. Frankfurt\u2019s interpretation is motivated\nnot only by Descartes\u2019 commitment to divine omnipotence; there\nare also some texts:\n\n\u2026 God cannot have been determined to make it true that\ncontradictories cannot be true together, and therefore\u2026 he\ncould have done the\n opposite.[8]\n\n\nI do not think that we should ever say of anything that it cannot be\nbrought about by God. For since every basis of truth and goodness\ndepends on his omnipotence, I would not dare to say that God cannot\nmake a mountain without a valley, or bring it about that 1 and 2 are\nnot\n 3.[9]\n\n\nIf Frankfurt is right, Cartesian eternal truths are not really\nnecessary; they \u201care inherently as contingent as any other\npropositions\u201d (42). They may appear to be necessary to our\nrational faculties, but this is just a function of the makeup of our\nrational faculties and not of the necessity of the truths themselves.\nFrankfurt then argues more generally that Descartes holds that for all\nwe know our rational faculties may be wrong about other things as\nwell. After all, we are mistaken about the necessity of the eternal\ntruths, which seems so very obvious, and so we might might be mistaken\nabout anything else that is similarly evident. If Frankfurt is\ncorrect, Descartes holds that there is a way that reality appears from\nthe viewpoint of the clearest of human reasoning, and the best that we\ncan do as rational agents is to take up that viewpoint. But we can\nnever get outside of it to see how things are\n absolutely.[10]\n\nIf Descartes holds that eternal truths are necessary in any robust\nsense, Frankfurt\u2019s view has an obvious drawback. It also suffers\nfrom the problem that it [Frankfurt\u2019s view] cannot be formulated\nwithout supposing that Descartes allows that there is a human\nperspective from which eternal truths can be seen to be non-necessary,\nbut an important component of Frankfurt\u2019s view is the thesis\nthat Descartes thinks that it is part of the structure of a human mind\nto regard eternal truths as wholly necessary.\n\nAnother drawback for Frankfurt\u2019s view is that it is\nself-contradictory in postulating that, according to Descartes, we\ncannot make claims about what reality is like absolutely. On\nFrankfurt\u2019s view, Descartes holds that God is omnipotent in the\nsense that He can do anything at all and has authority over even the\neternal truths. That is to say, Descartes holds that absolutely\nspeaking it is true that God can do anything at all and has\nauthority over the eternal truths. Frankfurt\u2019s Descartes is not\nentitled to say that. He is only entitled to say that from a finite\nhuman perspective it appears to be true that God can do anything and\nhas authority over the eternal truths. If Frankfurt is right, what is\nmaximally obvious to a finite mind is just that \u2013 what is\nmaximally obvious to a finite mind. It is not a guarantee of actual\ntruth.\n\nAn alternative view (developed and defended by Edwin Curley) is that\nDescartes holds that eternal truths are necessary, but that they are\nnot necessarily so. On this reading, Descartes\u2019 view involves\niterated modalities: a number of truths are possibly necessary, but\nGod chooses only some of these possibilities to be the actual\nnecessary truths (Curley 1984, 579\u2013603). One of the passages\nthat supports such a reading is from the already-cited letter to\nMesland:\n\nAnd even if God has willed that some truths should be necessary, this\ndoes not mean that he willed them necessarily; for it is one thing to\nwill that they be necessary, and quite another to will this\nnecessarily, or to be necessitated to will\n it.[11]\n\n\nOn Curley\u2019s reading, Descartes secures the necessity of eternal\ntruths by arguing that God willed them to be necessary, and hence it\ncan be said that it is false that they could have been otherwise. But\nDescartes also holds that God created the possibility that they not be\nnecessary, and that is why they are not necessarily necessary, as it\ncould have been the case that they could have been otherwise. Some\ncommentators have argued that a problem for Curley\u2019s view is\nthat it cannot allow Descartes to hold that eternal truths are\nabsolutely necessary \u2013 if it could have been the case that a\ngiven truth could have been otherwise, then it is not a necessary\n truth.[12]\n Curley indeed admits that, on his view, Descartes was confused about\nthe modal status of eternal truths (Curley 1984, 589). They might be\nhypothetically necessary, but nothing more than\n that.[13]\n Another problem is that Curley\u2019s view appears to put a severe\nconstraint on divine omnipotence: if God wants to make an eternal\ntruth false, He cannot make it false without first willing that it not\nbe necessary, for a necessary truth cannot be made false. If God\nalters the status of the truth so that it is no longer a necessary\ntruth, He can make it false, but He cannot make it false straightaway.\nA final problem is that Curley\u2019s reading supposes that there is\nsome point at which God\u2019s will could have been otherwise, but\nGod is eternal, and part of His essential perfection is to be wholly\nimmutable (Principles II.36, AT 8A:62).\n\nAn alternative reading of Descartes\u2019 comments on the eternal\ntruths suggests still another interpretation. Jonathan Bennett has\npointed out that in some of the key passages in question Descartes\ndoes not say that God can make contradictories true, but that we\nshould not say that God cannot make contradictories true (Bennett\n1994, 653\u201355). In such passages, for example in the\nalready-cited 1648 letter to Arnauld, Descartes is not saying anything\nabout God\u2019s power but about us and what we ought not say.\nPresumably, he is just invoking his Fourth Meditation rule for judging\nin these passages, as he is very explicit that when we do metaphysics\nwe ought not affirm what we do not clearly and distinctly\n understand.[14]\n Since we do not come close to understanding what it would be for one\nand two to add up to something other than three, and since we do not\nunderstand God\u2019s being unable to do something, the prospect that\nGod cannot make 1 and 2 not add to 3 is hopelessly confused.\nAccordingly, we ought not speak of it. The same analysis also applies\nto the important passage in the 1644 Mesland letter. Immediately after\nsaying that God can make contradictories true together, Descartes\ntakes it back: \u201c\u2026 even if this be true, we should not try\nto comprehend it, since our nature is incapable of doing so.\u201d\nDescartes\u2019 claim that God can make contradictories true is\nsomething that we ought not affirm when doing metaphysics and thus\nsomething that should have no bearing on our interpretation of\nDescartes\u2019 system. He tentatively flirts with the claim that God\ncould have made it possible for contradictories to be true together,\nbut then for systematic reasons he retracts it: he says that \u201cwe\nshould not put these thoughts before our minds\u201d and that in God\nthere is \u201conly a single activity, entirely simple and entirely\npure.\u201d Perhaps in a nod to divine omnipotence he says that God\ncould have made contradictories to be true together, but then he\nchecks himself and remembers that God wills by a single act that is\nimmutable and eternal. God is omnipotent, for Descartes, but as in any\nother case he understands omnipotence in way that squares with the\nother pillars of his system.\n\nBennett is right to emphasize the passages in which Descartes says of\na number of incoherent states of affairs that we ought not say that\nGod cannot bring them about. Bennett extends his view in ways that\nlead to some of the same problems that arise for Frankfurt, however.\nAccording to Bennett, Descartes does not take true modal claims to\napply or conform to real possibilities or necessities. In particular,\nthey do not apply to God. Instead, modality is just a function of how\nour minds have been constructed. Bennett thus arrives at a conclusion\nthat is similar to the one in Frankfurt, but from a different point of\ndeparture. Frankfurt supposes that for Descartes God is omnipotent in\nsuch a way that He can make eternal truths false, and thus that for\nany truth that we find to be necessary, its necessity is merely\napparent. But Bennett does not think that any modal truths\npertain to God. He grounds his interpretation on a text in which\nDescartes appears to offer the conceptualist account straightaway:\n\nIf by \u2018possible\u2019 you mean what everyone commonly means,\nnamely \u2018whatever does not conflict with our human\nconcepts\u2019, then it is manifest that the nature of God, as I have\ndescribed it, is possible in this sense, since I supposed it to\ncontain only what, according to our clear and distinct perceptions,\nmust belong to it; and hence it cannot conflict with our concepts.\nAlternatively, you may well be imagining some other kind of\npossibility which relates to the object itself; but unless this\nmatches the first sort of possibility it can never be known by the\nhuman intellect, and so it does not so much support a denial of\nGod\u2019s nature and existence as serve to undermine every other\nitem of human knowledge. (Second Replies, CSM 2:107; Bennett\n1994, 647\u2013648)\n\n\nLike Frankfurt, Bennett concludes that any claims that we make about\nGod and His necessary existence, or about the impossibility of His\nbeing a deceiver, are not a reflection of real possibilities and\nnecessities that pertain to God, but just a reflection of our minds\nand how we are compelled to think (Bennett 1994, 656\u2013658). A\nworry for Bennett (which as we have seen is also a worry for\nFrankfurt) is that Descartes appears to want to secure at least some\nresults that are true absolutely speaking \u2013 for example, that\nGod is supremely independent and that God has created finite minds in\na way that puts constraints on what we take to be possible. In\naddition, a textual concern for Bennett is that in the passage that he\ntakes to be the \u201cstrongest evidence for [his] reading\u201d\n(Bennett 1994, 647) Descartes does not say that possibility has no\nrelation to the \u201cobject itself.\u201d He says that any serious\naccount of possibility must coincide with what our concepts tell us is\npossible; otherwise, there would be no way for our minds to know\npossibility, and \u201cevery other item of human knowledge\u2026\n[would be] undermine[d]\u201d as a result. This is an evidential\nmisfire, and even worse \u2013 Bennett\u2019s interpretation\nsupposes that there is an unbridgeable gap between what we take to be\ntrue and what is actually true, and as such it would appear to\nundermine all human knowledge from the very start. It rules out all\nhuman knowledge from the start by supposing that for Descartes we can\nnever obtain any assurance that our clearest and most compelling\nperceptions of reality correspond to the way that reality is in fact.\nIf there is an interpretation of Descartes according to which there is\nno such gap, Cartesian knowledge would have at least some chance at\n vindication.[15]\n\nLilli Alanen has proposed an interpretation along these lines. She\nobjects to all of the views considered above: if they do not downplay\nthe necessity of Descartes\u2019 eternal truths by making them merely\nhypothetical, the interpretations eliminate their necessity altogether\nand at the same time commit Descartes to saying that best we can do\nepistemologically speaking is to arrive at results that seem to be\ntrue from human our point-of-view (Alanen 2008, 359\u2013364). Alanen\nherself concludes that in Descartes\u2019s system there are necessary\ntruths that are fully necessary and that have been authored by God.\nShe adds, however, that our understanding of divine activity is\nlimited in such a way that we have no understanding of how necessities\n(or possibilities) could be the product of His free will\n(ibid., 364\u2013367). A fulcrum point of Alanen\u2019s\nview is that there are no modal claims that apply to divine activity\nbecause God is always the author of any modal claims and hence they\nare always the subsequent product of that activity:\n\nThe idea that I take Descartes\u2019s controversial claims to express\nis, roughly, that it would be a mistake to assume some notion of\nmodality in terms of which Descartes\u2019s concept of divine power\ncould be explicated, and that we should not even try to do so. There\nis no modality prior to or independently of God\u2019s act of\nexercising his power\u2026. (ibid., 364)\n\n\nAlanen argues that for Descartes we are being hasty if we attempt to\npoint to considerations that we do not at all understand \u2013 for\nexample divine activity and any modalities that we think might apply\nto it \u2013 and if we then appeal to those considerations as a basis\nfor understanding the necessity of eternal truths. But that does not\nmean that we should conclude that truths about the necessary and the\npossible are merely subjective. Eternal truths like that two and two\nadd to four are in fact necessary, even if we do not understand the\nbackstory of God\u2019s production of them (ibid.,\n365\u2013367).\n\nAlanen\u2019s view is ingenious, but a serious worry that arises for\nit is that Descartes appears to hold (and without the slightest bit of\nequivocation) that there are modal claims that pertain to God and that\nare useful for explicating His behavior. For example, we conclude in\nthe Fourth Meditation that God cannot be a deceiver and therefore that\nwhatever we clearly and distinctly perceive is true. We would also\nappear to be entitled to include that because God is wholly immutable,\nthe laws of nature are utterly constant (Principles of\nPhilosophy II.36, CSM 1:240). Alanen is certainly right that none\nof the necessary truths that God wills would apply to His activity,\nbut that does not mean that no modal notions at all apply to His\nactivity \u2013 especially if Descartes himself makes so clear that\ndivine immutability and the impossibility of divine deception are data\nthat are to guide us in inquiry. And they are not simply guides in the\nsense of regulative principles or heuristics. We cannot once and for\nall lay down a result, for Descartes, unless we recognize that it is\ntrue that God exists and that it is impossible for Him to be\na deceiver. Descartes holds that there are modal claims that apply to\nGod, and he holds that God does not author these claims. Instead, they\napply to God by His nature. God is not the cause of any aspect of His\nessence or existence: His \u201cessence is so immense that he does\nnot need an efficient cause in order to exist\u201d (Fourth\nReplies, AT 7:241, CSM 2:168); \u201che has existed for eternity\nand will abide for eternity\u201d (The Fifth Meditation, AT 7:67, CSM\n2:46); \u201cHis essence is such that He possesses from\neternity\u201d all the divine attributes, and \u201cit is impossible\nfor such a being to have the power and will to give itself something\nnew\u201d (Fourth Replies, AT 7:241, CSM 2:168). For\nexample, God does not decide His own immutability, and He does not\ndecide any other attributes that apply to His nature, but as in all\ncases there are no truths about modality that are independent of\nHim.\n\nAnother attempt to preserve the necessity of eternal truths in\nDescartes\u2019 system is to run with such data and argue that if God\nwills a truth for eternity and His will is wholly immutable, the truth\nis eternal and necessary, and there does not exist the possibility\nthat it be otherwise. Such a possibility would not exist automatically\n\u2013 for it would only exist if God created it \u2013 and if\nDescartes holds that eternal truths are necessary, that is a signal\nthat he supposes that God never created that possibility at all.\n\nOne important passage is in the 1644 letter to Mesland (quoted above)\nin which Descartes says that \u201cGod cannot have been determined to\nmake it true that contradictories be true together, and therefore that\nhe could have done the opposite.\u201d As has already been noted,\nlater in the paragraph he takes it all back. In the larger passage, he\nwrites,\n\nBut if we would know the immensity of his power we should not put\nthese thoughts before our minds, nor should we conceive any precedence\nor priority between his intellect and will; for the idea which we have\nof God teaches us that there is in him only a single activity,\nentirely simple and entirely pure. This is well expressed by the\ndoctrine of St. Augustine: \u2018They are so because thou\nsee\u2019est them to be so\u2019; because in God seeing and willing\nare one and the same thing.\n\n\nThere are similar passages elsewhere in Descartes\u2019 corpus, where\nthe view that Descartes that takes himself to be able to express, and\nto express intelligibly, is that \u201cthere is always a single\nidentical and perfectly simple act by means of which he [God]\nsimultaneously understands, wills, and accomplishes everything.\u201d\nIf God is wholly immutable and wills the truths of mathematics and\ngeometry in a single act for eternity, it would appear that we are\nentitled to infer the result that those truths are necessary, just as\nwe can infer from the impossibility of divine deception that our clear\nand distinct perceptions are true. We must also consider the Third\nMeditation passage in which Descartes says that in God there is\nabsolutely nothing that is potential (AT 7:47, CSM 2:32). If there is\njust a single activity in God, and if it is simple and eternal, and\nalso immutable, then it makes no sense to talk of God as changing\ncourse and actualizing an alternative set of possibilities aside from\nthan the one that actually obtains (Cunning 2023, 192\u2013211). It\nmight be tempting to think that although God wills all of creaturely\nreality by a single immutable and eternal volition, God might have had\na different immutable and eternal volition. But in God there is\nabsolutely no potential being \u2013 a kind of being that Descartes\nsays \u201cstrictly speaking is nothing\u201d (ibid.). If\nso, there do not exist alternative possible eternal truths, and there\ndoes not exist the possibility of a change in God\u2019s eternal and\nimmutable will, and so (contra Frankfurt et al) eternal truths are\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nA final consideration to mention in favor of the view that Descartes\nholds that eternal truths are absolutely necessary is that it is\nsensitive to the important worry raised by Broughton (1987) and Nadler\n(1987) \u2013 that if Descartes holds that the eternal truths of\nmathematics, etc., could have been otherwise, then he is committed to\nthe conclusion that physical laws admit of more necessity than (for\nexample) the truth that two and two add to four. Descartes is clear\nthat physical laws follow from God\u2019s nature (for example\nPrinciples II.36\u201337, CSM 1:240\u2013241), and so they\nare absolutely necessary, but that would mean that he supposes that\nphysical laws are more necessary than eternal truths. If anything, we\nwould expect the story to go the other way around \u2013 that eternal\ntruths would be necessary and that physical laws would be wholly\ncontingent. In Descartes\u2019 system it would appear that laws of\nphysics are necessary and that eternal truths are necessary as\nwell.\n\nStill, we need to contend with the passage in which Descartes says\nthat God was free to make the radii of a circle unequal, and with the\npassages in which Descartes says more generally that God is free with\nrespect to each and every thing that He does. One way to read these\npassages is to make the assumption that Descartes has a libertarian\nconception of divine freedom and then conclude that if Descartes says\nthat God is free to do something, there exists the possibility that He\ndo it and also the possibility that He do something else (perhaps the\n opposite).[16]\n Descartes himself appears to understand divine freedom in very\ndifferent terms, however. He writes,\n\nAs for the freedom of the will, the way in which it exists in God is\nquite different from the way in which it exists in us. It is\nself-contradictory to suppose that the will of God was not indifferent\nfrom eternity with respect to everything that has happened or will\never happen; for it is impossible to imagine that anything is thought\nof in the divine intellect as good or true, or worthy of belief or\naction or omission, prior to the decision of the divine will to make\nit so. (Sixth Replies, AT 7:431\u201332, CSM 2:291)\n\n\nDescartes holds that God is free in creating the eternal truth that\nthe radii of a circle are equal. If God\u2019s freedom in this and\nother cases just consists in His complete indifference and\nindependence, then the Cartesian claim that God is free to do\nx does not entail that there exists the possibility that God\nnot do x or that there exists the possibility that God do\nsomething\n else.[17]\n\nDescartes makes a number of otherwise puzzling claims about\nGod\u2019s freedom to create the eternal truths, but if we interpret\nthese in the light of Descartes\u2019 stated conception of divine\nfreedom, they begin to look fairly mundane. A problem, however, is\nthat taken together the claims encourage the reading that Descartes is\na necessitarian. We consider for example the following comment that\nDescartes makes to Mersenne:\n\nIt will be said that if God had established these truths he could\nchange them as a king changes his laws. To this the answer is: Yes he\ncan, if his will can change. \u2018But I understand them to be\neternal and unchangeable.\u2019 \u2013 I make the same judgment\nabout God. \u2018But his will is free.\u2019 \u2013 Yes, but his\npower is beyond our grasp. (\u201cTo Mersenne, 15 April 1630,\u201d\nAT 1:145\u201346, CSMK 23).\n\n\nHere Descartes allows that there exists the possibility that God\ncreate alternate eternal truths only if God\u2019s will is mutable,\nbut of course Descartes holds that God\u2019s will is wholly\nimmutable, and immutable for eternity. God is still free of course,\nbut in a way that squares with His immutability: divine freedom is to\nbe understood in terms of indifference and independence. The worry\nthat is starting to arise is that if God is the immutable and eternal\nauthor of all reality \u2013 the eternal truths and everything else\nthat exists \u2013 then there does not exist the possibility that God\nwill an alternate series of creatures, and hence God does not author\nthat possibility, but instead everything that happens happens\nnecessarily. Descartes subscribes to a version of the Spinozistic view\nthat divine freedom is a matter of\n indifference,[18]\n and there is also some systematic evidence that Descartes accepts the\nSpinozistic doctrine of necessitarianism. As Descartes recognizes in\nthe 15 April 30 letter to Mersenne, we might encounter some cognitive\ndissonance in recognizing God\u2019s freedom as\n omnipotence.[19]\n He appears to subscribe to the view that the eternal truths are\nnecessary and that everything else that happens is necessary as\n well.[20]\n As he is reported to have said in Conversation with\nBurman:\n\nConcerning ethics and religion,\u2026 the opinion has prevailed that\nGod can be altered, because of the prayers of mankind; for no one\nwould have prayed to God if he knew, or had convinced himself, that\nGod was unalterable\u2026. From the metaphysical point of view,\nhowever, it is quite unintelligible that God should be anything but\ncompletely unalterable. It is irrelevant that the decrees could have\nbeen separated from God; indeed, this should not really be asserted.\nFor although God is completely indifferent with respect to all things,\nhe necessarily made the decrees he did, since he necessarily willed\nwhat was best, even though it was of his own will that he did what was\nbest. We should not make a separation here between the necessity and\nthe indifference that apply to God\u2019s decrees; although his\nactions were completely indifferent, they were also completely\nnecessary. Then again, although we may conceive that the decrees could\nhave been separated from God, this is merely a token procedure of our\nown reasoning: the distinction thus introduced between God himself and\nhis decrees is a mental, not a real one. In reality the decrees could\nnot have been separated from God: he is not prior to them or distinct\nfrom them, nor could he have existed without them. (AT 5:166, CSMK\n348)\n\n\nWe must repeat again, however, that this latter passage is from\nConversation with Burman, which was an interview in which\nDescartes reported his views, and not a primary text that Descartes\nwrote himself. The view that Descartes puts forward in the passage is\nvery much in line with the texts in which Descartes says that God is\nsimple and immutable, and creates by way of a single unchanging act\nfor all eternity, and indeed it pushes those texts to their logical\nconclusion. The passage is from an interview, however, and some might\nworry that it is not fully authoritative.\n\nIf Descartes holds in the final analysis that everything that happens\nhappens necessarily, it is easy to see how he can hold that eternal\ntruths are necessary and created by a God that is free (in the\nCartesian sense). However, Descartes will still have to contend with\nthe objection that there are texts in which he seems to be committed\nto the existence of unactualized possibilities and, in particular,\ntexts in which he appears to be committed to a non-compatibilist view\nof human\n freedom.[21]\n This objection will be discussed in sections four and six below.\n\nThus far we have considered the interpretive issue of whether or not\nDescartes\u2019 eternal truths could have been otherwise. A question\nthat still remains to be considered concerns the ontological status of\nDescartes\u2019 eternal truths, regardless of whether or not they\ncould have been otherwise.\n\nOne view is that since Descartes\u2019 eternal truths are neither\nfinite mental things, finite physical things, nor God, they must be\nsomething akin to Platonic forms (Kenny 1970, 692\u2013700). A\nproblem with this view, of course, is that it does violence to\nDescartes\u2019 parsimonious dualism. Another problem with the view\nis that Descartes says that eternal truths are beings which\n\u201chave no existence outside our thought\u201d\n(Principles I.48, AT 8A:23, CSM 1:208).\n\nA second view is that eternal truths are to be located in God\n(Schmaltz 1991, 135; Rozemond 2008, 41\u201363). One of the merits of\nthis view is that it provides for eternal truths to be eternal in a\nvery robust sense. God is eternal, and anything else is eternal if it\nis housed in His eternal mind. Still, the view conflicts with the fact\nthat Descartes holds that eternal truths are creatures and are housed\nin finite minds only.\n\nA third reading of Descartes on eternal truths is that they are ideas\nin finite minds. If truth is the conformity of thought with its object\n(\u201cTo Mersenne, 16 October 1639,\u201d AT 2:597, CSMK 139), then\neternal truths are ideas. But Descartes has also said that eternal\ntruths have no existence outside of our thought. They are true ideas,\nbut not true ideas in the mind of God because eternal truths are\ncreatures. A problem with this third reading, however, is that,\nalthough it allows eternal truths to be truths, it is not\nclear that it allows them to be eternal (Chappell 1997,\n123\u201327). In some passages Descartes does distance himself from\nthe appellation \u2018eternal truth\u2019: he refers to \u201cthose\ntruths which are called eternal\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 27 May\n1638,\u201d AT 2:138, CSMK 103) and to \u201c[t]he mathematical\ntruths which you call eternal\u201d (To Mersenne, 15 April 1630, AT\n1:145, CSMK 23). And he allows that things can be identified as\n\u2018eternal\u2019 so long as they \u201care always the\nsame\u201d (Fifth Replies, AT 7:381, CSM 2:262). So a\ndeflationary view of the eternality of Cartesian eternal truths might\nbe in order. However, Descartes says to Mersenne that \u201cfrom all\neternity [God] willed them [eternal truths] to be, and by that very\nfact he created them\u201d (\u201cTo [Mersenne], 27 May 1630,\u201d\nAT 1:152, CSMK 25). Descartes as a rule shies away from making claims\nabout theological matters, but it is not clear that we want to\nattribute to him the view that finite minds are co-eternal with\n God.[22]\n Perhaps he holds that human minds exist at every point in the series\nthat God wills, or perhaps his understanding of the eternality of\neternal truths is more deflationary: God wills a single series for all\neternity, and that series includes unchanging true ideas in finite\nminds.\n",
