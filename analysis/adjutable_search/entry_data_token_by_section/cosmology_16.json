    "main_text": "Origins of the Universe || Theories of the Initial State\n3.4 Theories of the Initial State\n\nThere are three main approaches to theories of the initial state, all\nof which have been pursued by cosmologists since the late 60s in\ndifferent forms. Expectations for what a theory of initial conditions\nshould achieve have been shaped, in particular, by inflationary\ncosmology. Inflation provided a natural account of the three otherwise\npuzzling features of the initial state emphasized in the previous\nsection. Prior to inflation, these features were regarded as\n\u201cenigmas\u201d (Dicke & Peebles 1979), but after inflation,\naccounting for these features has served as an eligibility requirement\nfor any proposed theory of the early universe.\n\nThe first approach aims to reduce dependence on special initial\nconditions by introducing a phase of attractor dynamics. This phase of\ndynamical evolution \u201cwashes away\u201d the traces of earlier\nstates, in the sense that a probability distribution assigned over\ninitial states converges towards an equilibrium distribution. Misner\n(1968) introduced a version of this approach (his \u201cchaotic\ncosmology program\u201d), proposing that free-streaming neutrinos\ncould isotropize an initially anisotropic state. Inflationary\ncosmology was initially motivated by a similar idea: a\n\u201cgeneric\u201d or \u201crandom\u201d initial state at the\nPlanck time would be expected to be \u201cchaotic\u201d, far from a\nflat FLRW model. During an inflationary stage, arbitrary initial\nstates are claimed to converge towards a state with the three features\ndescribed above.\n\nThe second approach regards the initial state as extremely special\nrather than generic. Penrose, in particular, has argued that the\ninitial state must be very special to explain time\u2019s arrow; the\nusual approaches fail to take seriously the fact that gravitational\ndegrees of freedom are not excited in the early universe like the\nothers (Penrose 2016). Penrose (1979) treats the second law as arising\nfrom a law-like constraint on the initial state of the universe,\nrequiring that it has low entropy. Rather than introducing a\nsubsequent stage of dynamical evolution that erases the imprint of the\ninitial state, we should aim to formulate a \u201ctheory of initial\nconditions\u201d that accounts for its special features.\nPenrose\u2019s conjecture is that the Weyl curvature tensor\napproaches zero as the initial singularity is approached; his\nhypothesis is explicitly time asymmetric, and implies that the early\nuniverse approaches an FLRW solution. (It does not account for the\nobserved perturbations, however.) Later he proposed the idea of\nConformal Cyclic Cosmology, where such a special initial state at the\nstart of one expansion epoch is the result of expansion in a previous\nepoch that wiped out almost all earlier traces of matter and radiation\n(Penrose 2016).\n\nA third approach rejects the framework accepted by the other two\nproposals, and regards the \u201cinitial state\u201d as a misnomer:\nit should instead by regarded as a \u201cbranch point\u201d where\nour pocket universe separated off from a larger multiverse. (There are\nstill, of course, questions regarding the initial state of the\nmultiverse ensemble, if one exists.) We will return to this approach\nin\n \u00a75\n below.\n\nA dynamical approach, even if it is successful in describing a phase\nof the universe\u2019s evolution, arguably does not offer a complete\nsolution to the problem of initial conditions: it collapses into one\nof the other two approaches. For example, an inflationary stage can\nonly begin in a region of spacetime if the inflaton field and the\ngeometry are uniform over a sufficiently large region, such that the\nstress-energy tensor is dominated by the potential term (implying that\nthe derivative terms are small) and the gravitational entropy is\nsmall. There are other model-dependent constraints on the initial\nstate of the inflaton field. One way to respond is to adopt\nPenrose\u2019s point of view, namely that this reflects the need to\nchoose a special initial state, or to derive one from a previous\nexpansion phase. The majority of those working in inflationary\ncosmology instead appeal to the third approach: rather than treating\ninflation as an addition to standard big-bang evolution in a single\nuniverse, we should treat the observed universe as part of a\nmultiverse, discussed below. But even this must have a theory of\ninitial conditions.\n",
