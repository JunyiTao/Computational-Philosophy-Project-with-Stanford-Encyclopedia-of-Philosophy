    "main_text": "\nBut to proceed in this reconciling project with regard to the question of liberty and necessity; the most contentious question of metaphysics, the most contentious science\u2026 \u2014David Hume (EU 8.23/95)\nIt is widely accepted that David Hume\u2019s contribution to the free will debate is one of the most influential statements of the \u201ccompatibilist\u201d position, where this is understood as the view that human freedom and moral responsibility can be reconciled with (causal) determinism. Hume\u2019s arguments on this subject are found primarily in the sections titled \u201cOf liberty and necessity\u201d, as first presented in A Treatise of Human Nature (2.3.1\u20132) and, later, in a slightly amended form, in the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (sec. 8). Although both contributions share the same title, there are, nevertheless, some significant differences between them. This includes, for example, some substantial additions in the Enquiry discussion as it relates to problems of religion, such as predestination and divine foreknowledge. These differences should not, however, be exaggerated. Hume\u2019s basic strategy and compatibilist commitments remain much the same in both works.\nThis article will be arranged around a basic contrast between two alternative interpretations of Hume\u2019s compatibilist strategy: the \u201cclassical\u201d and \u201cnaturalistic\u201d interpretations. According to the classical account, Hume\u2019s effort to articulate the conditions of moral responsibility, and the way they relate to the free will problem, should be understood primarily in terms of his views about the logic of  the concepts of \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cnecessity\u201d. In contrast with this, the naturalistic approach maintains that what is essential to Hume\u2019s account of the nature and conditions of responsible conduct is his description of the role that moral sentiment plays in this sphere. How we interpret Hume\u2019s core arguments relating to the free will debate must be understood, on this view, with reference to these psychological claims and concerns (which also accounts for the use of the label \u201cnaturalism\u201d in this context). On either account, the contrast between these two interpretations will be of importance, not only for our general understanding of Hume\u2019s philosophical system, but also for any adequate assessment of the contemporary value and relevance of Hume\u2019s views on this subject.\nThe first two sections of this article present and contrast the classical and naturalistic interpretations. Hume\u2019s views on causation and necessity are highly relevant to both these interpretations. The following three sections sections consider the contemporary significance of Hume\u2019s contribution, particularly as interpreted by the naturalistic account. The sixth and final section examines the relevance of Hume\u2019s views on free will for matters of religion.\n",
