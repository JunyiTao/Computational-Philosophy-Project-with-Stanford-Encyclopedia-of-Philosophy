    "main_text": "\n\nEvery action we take leaves a trail of information that could, in\nprinciple, be recorded and stored for future use. For instance, one\nmight use the older forms of information technologies of pen and paper\nand keep a detailed diary listing all the things one did and thought\nduring the day. It might be a daunting task to record all this\ninformation this way but there are a growing list of technologies and\nsoftware applications that can help us collect all manner of data,\nwhich in principle, and in practice, can be aggregated together for\nuse in building a data profile about you, a digital diary with\nmillions of entries. Some examples of which might be: a detailed\nlisting of all of your economic transactions; a GPS generated plot of\nwhere you traveled; a list of all the web addresses you visited and\nthe details of each search you initiated online; a listing of all your\nvital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate; all of your dietary\nintakes for the day; and any other kind of data that can be\nmeasured. As you go through this thought experiment you begin to see\nthe complex trail of data that you generate each and every day and how\nthat same data might be efficiently collected and stored though the\nuse of information technologies. It is here we can begin to see how\ninformation technology can impact moral values. As this data gathering\nbecomes more automated and ever-present, we must ask who is in control\nof collecting this data and what is done with it once it has been\ncollected and stored? Which bits of information should be made public,\nwhich held private, and which should be allowed to become the property\nof third parties like corporations? Questions of the production,\naccess, and control of information will be at the heart of moral\nchallenges surrounding the use of information technology.\n\nOne might argue that the situation just described is no different from\nthe moral issues revolving around the production, access, and control\nof any basic necessity of life. If one party has the privilege of the\nexclusive production, access, and/or control of some natural resource,\nthen that by necessity prohibits others from using this resource\nwithout the consent of the exclusive owner. This is not necessarily so\nwith digital information. Digital information is nonexclusory, meaning\nwe can all, at least theoretically, possess the same digital\ninformation without excluding its use from others. This is because\ncopying digital information from one source to another does not\nrequire eliminating the previous copy. Unlike a physical object,\ntheoretically, we can all possess the same digital object as it can be\ncopied indefinitely with no loss of fidelity. Since making these\ncopies is often so cheap that it is almost without cost, there is no\ntechnical obstacle to the spread of all information as long as there\nare people willing to copy it and distribute it. Only appeals to\nmorality, or economic justice might prevent the distribution of\ncertain forms of information. For example, digital entertainment\nmedia, such as songs or video, has been a recurring battleground as\nusers and producers of the digital media fight to either curtail or\nextend the free distribution of this material. Therefore,\nunderstanding the role of moral values in information technology is\nindispensable to the design and use of these technologies (Johnson,\n1985, Moore, 1985, Nissenbaum, 1998, Spinello, 2001). It should be\nnoted that this entry will not directly address the phenomenological\napproach to the ethics of information technology since there is a\ndetailed entry on this subject available (see the entry on\n phenomenological approaches to ethics and information technology).\n",
