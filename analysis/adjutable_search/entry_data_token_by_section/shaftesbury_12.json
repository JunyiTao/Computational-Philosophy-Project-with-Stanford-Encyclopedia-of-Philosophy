    "main_text": "Politics || Toleration\n5.3 Toleration\n\nShaftesbury\u2019s commitment to liberty extends to toleration of\nreligious difference (see Carey 2006: 144\u20135 and Klein 1994:\n137). His reasons for this are consonant with his reasons for thinking\nthe best the state can do with regard to personal morality is create\nthe conditions for people to achieve virtue on their own. Just as it\nis impossible to force people to virtue because virtue essentially\ninvolves acting from reasons other than external reward and\npunishment, so too is it impossible to force people to true religious\ndevotion because true religious devotion essentially involves an\ninward feeling of love\u2014\u201cthe disinterested Love of\nGod\u201d (C 2.271), the \u201clove of God\nfor his own sake\u201d (C\n2.58)\u2014and not merely the kind of external behavior that can be\nenforced. Forcing people to love God is no more possible than forcing\nsomeone to romantically love another person (C 1.17\u201319). In\nfact, attempts to force religious uniformity\u2014\u201ca hopeful\nProject!\u201d Shaftesbury sarcastically calls it\u2014are bound to\nfailure, likely resulting only in in the further corruption of\npeople\u2019s characters (C 1.19).\n\n\nBut a new sort of Policy, which extends it-self to another World, and\nconsiders the future Lives and Happiness of Men rather than the\npresent, has made us leap the Bounds of natural Humanity; and out of a\nsupernatural Charity, has taught us the way of plaguing one another\nmost devoutly. It has rais\u2019d an Antipathy which no temporal\nInterest cou\u2019d ever do; and entail\u2019d upon us a mutual\nHatred to all Eternity. (C 1.18\u201319)\n\n\nRestrictions on religious practices are likely to be as\ncounterproductive as attempts to enforce virtue. Shaftesbury is not,\nhowever, opposed to state-established religion. \u201cPeople\nshou\u2019d have a Publick Leading in Religion,\u201d he\nwrites.\n\n\nFor to deny the Magistrate a Worship, or take away a National Church,\nis as mere Enthusiasm as the Notion which sets up Persecution. For why\nshou\u2019d there not be publick Walks, as well as private Gardens?\n(C 1.17)\n\n",
