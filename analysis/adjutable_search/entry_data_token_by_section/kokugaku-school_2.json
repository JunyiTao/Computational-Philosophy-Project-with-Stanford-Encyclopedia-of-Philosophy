    "main_text": "The Emergence of Kokugaku || Kada no Azumamaro (1666\u20131736)\n2.2 Kada no Azumamaro (1666\u20131736)\n\nRaised in the environment of the Inari Shinto Shrine in Fushimi just\nsouth of Kyoto, Azumamaro moved to Edo in 1700 lecturing on Shinto\ntopics to a small school of mostly priests, and establishing a\nreputation as an authority on antiquarian matters. Perhaps inspired by\nIt\u014d Jinsai\u2019s success during the 1680s in establishing a\nConfucian private academy in Kyoto, and also perhaps by the Hayashi\nfamily\u2019s success in garnering Bakufu support for a Confucian\nacademy in Edo, Azumamaro also sought potential sponsors for his dream\nof founding a school dedicated to Japanese studies.\n\nReturning to Fushimi and the Shrine in 1713, Azumamaro\u2019s later\nwritings spanned the entire range of what would become the Kokugaku\ncurriculum: commentaries on prose and poetry classics, studies of\nancient histories (especially the 720 CE Nihon shoki),\nhistorical linguistics, and antiquarian matters generally. The core of\nhis scholarship, however, was Shinto and Shinto-related topics.\nAzumamaro\u2019s focus was on the most ancient texts, seeking to\ndisentangle the Shinto of his day from centuries of Buddhist\nsyncretism and, less successfully, more recent decades of\nConfucianized Shinto. Nonetheless, he did champion Shinto and its\nancient links with the monarchy as the native Japanese Way, the\nessence of Japaneseness, and the principal factor behind the\nhistorical stability of the Japanese polity.\n\nAzumamaro\u2019s contributions to later Kokugaku lie in the Shinto\ntone he set, the methodology of historical linguistics he championed,\nthe binary opposition with Chinese studies he established, the\ninstitutional development of the nativist private academy, and the\naccomplishments of his students. \n\nMany scholars credit Azumamaro with petitioning the Bakufu in 1728 to\nfound a school of Kokugaku. Though nothing came of it, the Petition\nrepresents a succinct statement of Kokugaku\u2019s aims and the Kada\nSchool\u2019s vigorous rationale for it:\n\n\nAlas, how ignorant the Confucian scholars were of the past, not\nknowing a single thing about the imperial Japanese learning\u2026.\nFalse doctrines are rampant, taking advantage of our weakness\u2026.\nIf the old words are not understood, the old meanings will not be\nclear. If the old meanings are not clear, the old learning will not\nrevive. The Way of the former kings is disappearing; the ideas of the\nwise men of antiquity have almost been abandoned. The loss will not be\na slight one if we fail now to teach philology. (SJTa:\n401\u2013402)\n\n\nAfter Azumamaro\u2019s death in 1736, the center of native studies\nshifted from Kyoto to Edo, where Azumamaro\u2019s scholarship was\nalready represented by his adopted son Arimaro (1706\u201351).\nArimaro was then joined in Edo by another of his father\u2019s\nstudents, Kamo no Mabuchi, whose magnum opus would be a\ncomprehensive study of Man\u2019y\u014dsh\u016b and the\neffort to glean from it an authentic ancient native Way believed to be\nencoded within its verses.\n",
