    "main_text": "Reception || Arabic\n9.1 Arabic\n\nIbn Rushd is often described as a philosopher who failed to attract\nthe attention of his first audience, resulting in the death of his\nphilosophy at the hands of its intended Islamic readers, a state of\naffairs that is said to have continued until its revival in the\nideological debates of the Arab Renaissance (nah\u1e0da)\n(K\u00fcgelgen 1994, al-J\u0101bir\u012b 1998). To be sure, Ibn\nRushd\u2019s influence in Muslim contexts cannot compare to the\noverwhelming influence of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, nor even to Ibn\nRushd\u2019s own influence in Europe. Still, the commonly heard claim\nthat he had no influence on Islamic thought is false.\n\nFirst, recent scholarship has shown that Ibn Rushd had successors. Ben\nShar\u012bfa (1999) identifies 39 direct disciples of Ibn Rushd, most\nof whom were faithful, and some of whom continued his work in\nphilosophy and related sciences.\n\nSecond, after Ibn Rushd\u2019s death, his works were hardly ignored\nby the leading scholars in Andalusia and Morocco. Theologians,\nmathematicians, suf\u012bs, historians, physicians, philosophers and\nliterary figures used Ibn Rushd\u2019s works extensively. In medicine\nand logic, his influence on Ibn \u1e6cuml\u016bs has recently become\napparent (Ibn \u1e6cuml\u016bs 2020; Ben Ahmed 2016, 2017, 2019c,\n2020a). His influence also extended to Ash\u02bfarite theology, as\nwhen Ab\u016b al-\u1e24ajj\u0101j Y\u016bsuf al-Mikl\u0101t\u012b\nquoted Ibn Rushd\u2019s epitome on the Metaphysics and the\nIncoherence of the Incoherence to refute the philosophers\n(\u1e24amd\u0101n 2005). The same can be said of certain Maghrebi\nmathematicians who benefited from the conceptual arsenal provided by\nIbn Rushd\u2019s philosophical writings. In this context, one can\ncite the example of Ibn Hayd\u016br al-T\u0101dil\u012b, who put\nforward the concept of \u201cthe one\u201d (al-w\u0101hid)\nas crystallized by Ibn Rushd (Ibn Hayd\u016br 2018). Ibn\n\u1e6cuml\u016bs, al-Mikl\u0101ti, Ibn \u02bfAm\u012bra\nal-Makhz\u016bm\u012b, and Ibn Hayd\u016br, among others, appropriate\nIbn Rushd\u2019s philosophical analysis without naming him, whereas\nIbn Sab\u02bf\u012bn on occasion uses Ibn Rushd\u2019s writings\nwithout name even while in other places he criticizes him by\nname\u2014thus complicating the task of identifying the texts used.\nSome of these texts, in particular in jurisprudence and religion, were\npart of the curriculum in Andalusia until its fall (Ben Shar\u012bfa\n1999; Akasoy 2008; Ben Ahmed 2019b). Indeed, in Muslim contexts, some\nof Ibn Rushd\u2019s works have been in constant use from the\nlatter\u2019s lifetime until today. They formed part of the training\nof scholars such as Ibn al-Tilims\u0101n\u012b and Ibn Khald\u016bn,\nas well as part of the curriculum of important teachers such as\nAb\u016b \u02bfAbd al-L\u0101h al-\u0100bil\u012b (Ibn\nal-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb 1975, iii: 507; Ibn Khald\u016bn 2004).\n\nThird, evidence has emerged that some of Ibn Rushd\u2019s books were\ntransmitted east, to Egypt and the Levant, and used by philosophers\nand scholars there. In addition to copies of the Kashf and\nthe Incoherence found in Turkey, Egypt, and India, and the\ntestimony of\n Maimonides,\n who from Egypt was able to acquire most of Ibn Rushd\u2019s\ncommentaries (Davidson 2005, 108\u201310), we can identify the spread\nof Ibn Rushd\u2019s ideas among some philosophers, as is the case\nwith the theory of the unity of truth adopted by\n Abd al-Lat\u012bf al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b\n (Ben Ahmed 2019a). Moreover, some of Ibn Rushd\u2019s philosophical\nand metaphysical positions concerning causality and location were\nadopted by thinkers who were generally regarded as enemies of\nphilosophical and rational thought, as is the case with Ibn Taymiyya,\nwho made extensive and explicit use of Ibn Rushd\u2019s texts and\nadopted some of his positions in his crystallization of his conception\nof the history of philosophy and kal\u0101m (Ben Ahmed 2019b,\n2020b, 2020d; Hoover 2018).\n\nFourth, we now also have evidence that Ibn Rushd\u2019s texts reached\nIran in the sixteenth century and became widely known to scholars in\nthe seventeenth century. The catalogues indicate that dozens of them\nwere transcribed during this time. The large number of copies reflects\nanother phenomenon that we should not continue to ignore: the demand\nfor the teaching of these books and their use by students and teachers\nin madrasas in Safavid Iran. Some thinkers and philosophers used them\nin their debates and teaching. Suffice it to mention here Abd\nal-Razz\u0101q al-L\u0101h\u012bj\u012b, Mullah Rajab \u02bfAl\u012b\nTabr\u012bz\u012b, and Mu\u1e25ammad \u1e6c\u0101hir\nWa\u1e25\u012bd al-Zam\u0101n Qazw\u012bn\u012b (Endress 1999, 2001,\n2006; Pourjavady and Schmidtke, 2015; Ben Ahmed forthcoming).\n",
