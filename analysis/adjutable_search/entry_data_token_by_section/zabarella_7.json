    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy and Medicine\n8. Natural Philosophy and Medicine\n\n\nAmong the Paduan Aristotelians Zabarella was probably the author who\ndiscussed most thoroughly the relationship between the philosophy of\nnature and medical art. While in subject-matter these disciplines were\nclose to each other, in their essence and methodology they were far\napart. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Zabarella did not consider\nmedicine to subalternated to the philosophy of nature. Nor did he see\nthe distinction between theoretical and practical medicine as\naccidental; instead he wanted to consider the whole art of medicine as\noperational. In spite of medicine\u2019s prominent place among the arts;\nZabarella sharply denied its scientific status, and insisted that\nwriters who claim that medicine is a science are mistaken. Neither the\nart of medicine nor its singular parts can be considered as science.\nFor him it was enough to admit that it is the noblest of all arts.\n\n\nIn his De natura logicae (part of the Opera logica)\nZabarella attacks writers who put medicine alongside the philosophy of\nnature among the sciences. Contemplative philosophy appropriates\nnothing from the productive arts, but instead the arts adopt\neverything from philosophy. No matter how valuable and precise\nmedicine may be, it could never be a science because it is practised\nnot for the sake of knowledge, but for an end product: that is, the\nmaintenance or restoration of health. If knowledge of the human body\nis considered purely for its own sake, rather than for curative\npurposes, it should be called natural philosophy rather than\nmedicine. Even if it were admitted that medicine could be practised\nfor the sake of knowledge, it could not be called a pure science,\nbecause it does not explain the first causes, and without this\ncomprehension the other causes cannot be clearly apprehended. Health\ncannot be fully comprehended and the goal of medicine cannot be\nachieved, if a physician does not comprehend all the parst of a human\nbody and their nature, composition, purpose, and function.\n\n\nZabarella recognizes two different ways in which a physician can know\nthe parts of a human body. First, he may learn them through perceptive\nknowledge and anatomical observations, thereby assimilating the matter\nof his discipline without understanding its rationale. A physician can\nalso become familiar with the parts of human body through philosophy\nof nature where he may learn the reasons, which lie behind what he\nactually sees. Zabarella thinks Aristotle made the same distinction in\nhis books the History of Animals and the Parts of\nAnimals. In the first he relies on sense perception to classify\nthe different parts of animals. In the second, he offers causal\nexplanations for what he is considering. In Zabarella\u2019s opinion this\norder of understanding results from our own inability to comprehend\neverything at once. It is thus better to progress gradually from\nconfuse to distinct knowledge. In De rebus naturalibus\nZabarella points out that the art of medicine adopts the physiological\npart from the philosophy of nature. If medical writers want to know\nthe anatomy of the human body, they must therefore follow Aristotle\nmethodologically. Therefore they should not study the History of\nAnimals, but instead the Parts of Animals, which shows\nus the functions of different parts of the bodies in question. The\nsubject-matter of medicine involves maintaining or recovering health\nonly in human beings, not in other animals. Since the whole discipline\ndeals only with the human body, it cannot be a science in Zabarella\u2019s\nview. What a natural philosopher writes about animals, a medical\nwriter should apply to human beings.\n\n\nZabarella moves from the universal and scientific discussion of\nnatural philosophy to a consideration of its particular aspects from\nthe standpoint of operation, not knowledge. Moreover, Zabarella\nbelieved that natural philosophy and medicine differ not only in their\naims and subject-matters, but also in their methods. The resolutive\nmethod is proper to medicine and the compositive method to the\nphilosophy of nature. A physician does not use demonstrations, and if\nhe does, he borrows them from natural philosophy. In medical art the\nresolutive order of presentation proceeds from knowledge to cure. The\nend, that is maintaining or recovering health, is broken down into\nprinciples, on which the operation is then based. In the order of\npresentation Zabarella wants to differentiate between the presentation\nof a whole discipline and that of a part of it. For example, the first\npart of the art of medicine, physiology, has a compositive order as\nagainst the medicine as a whole, which is arranged according to a\nresolutive order. In Zabarella\u2019s view this shows that physiology\ndoes not really belong to medicine at all, but to natural philosophy,\nbecause in physiology the nature of a human body is studied apart from\noperation.\n\n\nZabarella\u2019s conclusion about the relationship between the art\nof medicine and natural philosophy is that the latter must consider the\nuniversal qualities of health and sickness, while the former\nconcentrates on finding remedies for particular diseases. Zabarella\nsuggests that Aristotle wrote a book of health and sickness of which\nnothing but a small fragment remains. These fragments are on the\nborderline of these two disciplines. Zabarella sums this up: where the\nphilosopher ends, there the physician begins (ubi desinit\nphilosophus, ibi incipit medicus). From the universal\nconsideration of sickness and health the physician descends to the\ntreatment of all particular diseases and to knowledge of their causes.\nWhile discussing the principles of medical art Zabarella compares\nanatomical principles with principles derived from natural philosophy.\nIn his view, only the philosophy of nature, not anatomy, can provide a\nsolid basis for medical practioners (Mikkeli 1997, pp. 221\u2013225).\n",
