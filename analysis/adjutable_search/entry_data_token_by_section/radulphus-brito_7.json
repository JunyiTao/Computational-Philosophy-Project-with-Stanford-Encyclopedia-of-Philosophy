The discussion is directly related to the debate between those\n(like Albert the Great) who describe the soul as the extrinsically\ngiven perfection of the living body, and those (like Thomas Aquinas)\nwho describe it as the living body\u2019s intrinsic substantial form.\nThe first group of commentators refrained from describing the soul as\nthe substantial form of the body because this seemed too close to the\nmaterialist account of Alexander of Aphrodisias, who seemingly would\ndeny the possibility of the separation of the human soul after the\nbody\u2019s death. Albert therefore describes the soul as that which\nextrinsically perfects (perficit) a material body that has\nlife potentially\u2014a material body capable of performing the\noperations causally related to being alive. Aquinas, however, opts for\na description more in accordance with Aristotelian doctrine: the soul\nis the intrinsic substantial form of the living body, for that which\nseparates animate from inanimate bodies must belong essentially, and\nintrinsically, to animate bodies as their form. Brito, in turn, sides\nwith Aquinas and describes the soul as the substantial form of the\nbody. His position is supported by two arguments: a substantial form\nis that due to which something receives its specific name (e.g.,\n\u2018horse\u2019); when this form is removed, its subject is called\nby that name only equivocally (e.g., a dead horse is called \u2018a\nhorse\u2019 only equivocally); since the soul is that due to which an\nanimate body is said to be animate per se, and since its removal makes\nthe body animate only equivocally, the soul must be the substantial\nform of the animate body (QDA-2012-II: 319). More\nimportantly, the substantial form is that due to which individuals\nbelonging to a natural kind can perform the specific operations that\ndistinguish them from other kinds belonging to the same genus. Hence,\nsince the soul is that due to which the animate body can perform its\nspecific operations of growth, nutrition, sensation, and\nunderstanding, the soul must be described as the substantial form of\nthe animate body (QDA-2012-II: 320).\n\nAccordingly, Brito also considers the animate body\u2014the\nhylomorphic composition of body and soul\u2014to be an essential\nunity\u2014a unity where the body is the material part and the soul\nis the formal part (QDA-2012-II: 325). Like Aristotle, Brito\ndismisses as misleading the question about the metaphysical link that\nbinds soul and body together into an essential unity. In fact, there\nis no such link that could belong essentially and intrinsically to the\nanimate body. If there were, it would be either material or formal. It\ncannot be material, because whatever is material is also potential,\nand whatever is potential is unable to actually connect body and soul.\nIf it were formal, it would be either a substantial or an accidental\nform. It cannot be a substantial form, for then the animate body would\nhave two substantial forms\u2014a possibility that Brito\ncategorically rejects. And it cannot be an accidental form, because\nthe possession of accidents naturally implies the possession of a\nsubstantial form that serves as their support. Hence, we end up with\nan additional substantial form that supports the accident that binds\nbody and soul. Consequently, the cause of the union of body and soul\ncan only be an extrinsic agent that does not belong essentially to the\nanimate body (QDA-2012-II: 326).\n\nBrito defends, then, the correctness of Aristotle\u2019s definition\nof the soul as the act of an organic physical body that has life\npotentially. In keeping with the description of the soul as a\nsubstantial form, the soul is defined as that which essentially\nconstitutes the first actualization of the animate body. The rest of\nthe definition singles out the specific kind of body the soul\nactualizes. First, the body in question is natural and not artificial,\nfor the actualization of the body by the soul creates an individual\nbelonging to a natural kind and not an artifact like a table. Second,\nit is organized (i.e., organic), for it involves an interconnected set\nof fundamentally different parts whereby the different operations of\nthe animate body are carried out (QDA-2012-II: 328). Finally,\nit has life potentially, quite simply because there cannot be\nsomething actual in a certain respect that was not previously\npotential in the very same respect. In other words, one could not be\nan actual living being if one\u2019s body did not first possess the\npotential to be alive (QDA-2012-II: 329). Consequently,\naccording to Brito, Aristotle\u2019s definition of the soul correctly\nplaces the soul in the class of substantial acts or forms, just as it\ncorrectly singles out the specific kind of matter that this act or\nform actualizes\u2014an organic physical body that has life\npotentially.\n",
