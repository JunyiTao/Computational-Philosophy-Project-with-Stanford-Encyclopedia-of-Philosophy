    "main_text": "The Argument From Expectation\n3. The Argument From Expectation\n\nHe continues:\n\nLet us see. Since there is an equal risk of gain and of loss, if you\nhad only to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager. But\nif there were three lives to gain, you would have to play (since you\nare under the necessity of playing), and you would be imprudent, when\nyou are forced to play, not to chance your life to gain three at a\ngame where there is an equal risk of loss and gain. But there is an\neternity of life and happiness.\n\n\nUnderstanding \u201cequal risk\u201d here\u00a0as \u201cequal\nprobability\u201d, the probability of gain (winning the wager) and of\nloss (losing the wager) must each be 1/2.\u00a0His hypothetically\nspeaking of \u201ctwo lives\u201d and \u201cthree lives\u201d may\nstrike one as odd. It is helpful to bear in mind Pascal\u2019s\ninterest in gambling (which after all provided the initial motivation\nfor his study of probability) and to take the gambling model quite\nseriously here. Indeed, the Wager is permeated with gambling\nmetaphors: \u201cgame\u201d, \u201cstake\u201d, \u201cheads or\ntails\u201d, \u201ccards\u201d and, of course, \u201cwager\u201d.\nNow, recall our calculation of the expectations of the two dollar and\nthree dollar gambles. Pascal apparently assumes now that utility is\nlinear in number of lives, that wagering for God costs\n\u201cone life\u201d, and then reasons analogously to the way we did\nin our expectation calculations above! This is, as it were, a warm-up.\nSince wagering for God is rationally required even in the hypothetical\ncase in which one of the prizes is three lives, then all the more it\nis rationally required in the actual case, in which one of the prizes\nis an eternity of life (salvation).\n\nSo Pascal has now made two striking assumptions:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(1). The probability of God\u2019s existence is\n1/2.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(2). Wagering for God brings infinite\nreward if God exists.\n\nMorris 1994 is sympathetic to (1), while Hacking 1972 finds it\n\u201ca monstrous premiss\u201d (189). One way to defend it is via\nthe classical interpretation of probability, according to which all\npossibilities are given equal weight. The interpretation seems\nattractive for various gambling games, which by design involve an\nevidential symmetry with respect to their outcomes; and Pascal even\nlikens God\u2019s existence to a coin toss, evidentially speaking.\nHowever, unless more is said, the interpretation yields implausible,\nand even contradictory results. (You have a one-in-a-million chance of\nwinning the lottery; but either you win the lottery or you\ndon\u2019t, so each of these possibilities has probability 1/2?!)\nPascal\u2019s argument for (1) is presumably that \u201c[r]eason can\ndecide nothing here\u201d. (In the lottery ticket case, reason can\ndecide something.) But it is not clear that complete\nignorance should be modeled as equiprobability. Morris imagines,\nrather, an agent who does have evidence for and against the existence\nof God, but it is equally balanced. In any case, it \\(is\\) clear that\nthere are people in Pascal\u2019s audience who do not assign\nprobability 1/2 to God\u2019s existence. This argument, then, does\nnot speak to them.\n\nHowever, Pascal realizes that the value of 1/2 actually plays no real\nrole in the argument, thanks to (2). This brings us to the third, and\nby far the most important, of his arguments.\n",
