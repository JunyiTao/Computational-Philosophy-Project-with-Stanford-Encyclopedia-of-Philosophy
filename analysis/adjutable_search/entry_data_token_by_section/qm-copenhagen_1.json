    "main_text": "Classical Physics\n2. Classical Physics\n\nBohr saw quantum mechanics as a generalization of classical physics\nalthough it violates some of the basic ontological principles on which\nclassical physics rests. Some of these principles are:\n\nThe principles of physical objects and their identity:\n\n\nPhysical objects (systems of objects) exist in space and time and\nphysical processes take place in space and time, i.e., it is a\nfundamental feature of all changes and movements of physical objects\n(systems of objects) that they happen on a background of space and\ntime;\nPhysical objects (systems) are localizable, i.e., they do not\nexist everywhere in space and time; rather, they are confined to\ndefinite places and times;\nA particular place can only be occupied by one object of the same\nkind at a time;\nTwo physical objects of the same kind exist separately; i.e., two\nobjects that belong to the same kind cannot have identical location at\nan identical time and must therefore be separated in space and\ntime;\nPhysical objects are countable, i.e., two alluded objects of the\nsame kind count numerically as one if both share identical location at\na time and counts numerically as two if they occupy different\nlocations at a time;\n\nThe principle of separated properties, i.e., two objects\n(systems) separated in space and time have each independent inherent\nstates or properties;\nThe principle of value determinateness, i.e., all\ninherent states or properties have a specific value or magnitude\nindependent of the value or magnitude of other properties;\nThe principle of causality, i.e., every event, every\nchange of a system, has a cause;\nThe principle of determination, i.e., every later state\nof a system is uniquely determined by any earlier state;\nThe principle of continuity, i.e., all processes\nexhibiting a difference between the initial and the final state have\nto go through every possible intervening state; in other words, the\nevolution of a system is an unbroken path through its state space; and\nfinally\nThe principle of the conservation of energy, i.e., the\nenergy of a closed system can be transformed into various forms but is\nnever gained, lost or destroyed.\n\n\nDue to these principles it is possible within, say, classical\nmechanics, to define a state of a system at any later time with\nrespect to a state at any earlier time. So whenever we know the\ninitial state consisting of the system\u2019s position and momentum,\nand know all external forces acting on it, we also know what will be\nits later states. The knowledge of the initial state is usually\nacquired by observing the state properties of the system at the time\nselected as the initial moment. Furthermore, the observation of a\nsystem does not affect its later behavior or, if observation somehow\nshould influence this behavior, it is always possible to incorporate\nthe effect into the prediction of the system\u2019s later state.\nThus, in classical physics we can always draw a sharp distinction\nbetween the state of the measuring instrument being used on a system\nand the state of the physical system itself. It means that the\nphysical description of the system is objective because the definition\nof any later state is not dependent on measuring conditions or other\nobservational conditions.\n\nMuch of Kant\u2019s philosophy can be seen as an attempt to provide\nsatisfactory philosophical grounds for the objective basis of\nNewton\u2019s mechanics against Humean scepticism. Kant thus argued\nthat classical mechanics is in accordance with the transcendental\nconditions for objective knowledge. Kant\u2019s philosophy\nundoubtedly influenced Bohr in various ways, as many scholars in\nrecent years have noticed (Hooker 1972; Folse 1985; Honner 1987; Faye\n1991; Kaiser 1992; and Chevalley 1994). Bohr was definitely neither a\nsubjectivist nor a positivist philosopher, as Karl Popper (1967) and\nMario Bunge (1967) have claimed. He explicitly rejected the idea that\nthe experimental outcome is due to the observer. As he said: \u201cIt\nis certainly not possible for the observer to influence the events\nwhich may appear under the conditions he has arranged\u201d\n(APHK, p.51). Not unlike Kant, Bohr thought that we could\nhave objective knowledge only in case we can distinguish between the\nexperiential subject and the experienced object. It is a precondition\nfor the knowledge of a phenomenon as being something distinct from the\nsensorial subject, that we can refer to it as an object without\ninvolving the subject\u2019s experience of the object. In order to\nseparate the object from the subject itself, the experiential subject\nmust be able to distinguish between the form and the content of his or\nher experiences. This is possible only if the subject uses causal and\nspatial-temporal concepts for describing the sensorial content,\nplacing phenomena in causal connection in space and time, since it is\nthe causal space-time description of our perceptions that constitutes\nthe criterion of reality for them. Bohr therefore believed that what\ngives us the possibility of talking about an object and an objectively\nexisting reality is the application of those necessary concepts, and\nthat the physical equivalents of \u201cspace,\u201d\n\u201ctime,\u201d \u201ccausation,\u201d and\n\u201ccontinuity\u201d were the concepts \u201cposition,\u201d\n\u201ctime,\u201d \u201cmomentum,\u201d and \u201cenergy,\u201d\nwhich he referred to as the classical concepts. He also\nbelieved that the above basic concepts exist already as preconditions\nof unambiguous and meaningful communication, built in as rules of our\nordinary language. So, in Bohr\u2019s opinion the conditions for an\nobjective description of nature given by the concepts of classical\nphysics were merely a refinement of the preconditions of human\nknowledge.\n",
