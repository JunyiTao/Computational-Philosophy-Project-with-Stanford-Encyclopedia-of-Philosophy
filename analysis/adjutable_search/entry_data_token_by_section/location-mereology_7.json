    "main_text": "Interpenetration || For Interpenetration #3: from Bosons\n4.3 For Interpenetration #3: from Bosons\n\nOne question that has been raised in the recent philosophical\nliterature is whether contemporary physics provides us with examples\nof disjoint fundamental particles that have the same, or overlapping,\nexact locations. Hawthorne and Uzquiano apparently claim that the\nanswer is \u2018Yes\u2019. They write that\n\n\nparticles having integral spin\u2014otherwise known as\nbosons\u2014in modern particle physics \u2026 are generally thought\nto be point-sized. Moreover, according to the spin statistics theorem,\nwhile fermions\u2014point-particles with half integer\nspin\u2014cannot be colocated, bosons are perfectly well able to\ncohabit a single spacetime point. (2011: 3\u20134)\n\n\nSchaffer suggests otherwise:\n\n\n[a] more sophisticated treatment of these cases involves field theory.\nInstead of there being two bosons co-located at region r, there\nis a bosonic field with doubled intensity at r. (2009: 140)\n\n\nWhereas Hawthorne and Uzquiano apparently take bosons to provide\nactual examples of interpenetration, McDaniel suggests that\nthey at least reinforce the conceivability of such\ncounterexamples:\n\n\nwhat this example shows is that [disjoint] co-located material objects\nare not merely conceivable, but that a tremendously detailed\nconception of them has been formed: [disjoint] co-located objects play\na role in the interpretation of certain physical theories. It might be\nthat at the end of the day speculative physics will postulate\nco-located material objects. It seems to me that we should not\ndisregard this possibility a priori. (2007a: 240)\n\n\nIf one's goal, in constructing a theory of location, is to articulate\nthe necessary and a priori truths governing location and its\ninteraction with parthood, then even McDaniel's modest point still\ncounts against including No Interpenetration in one's theory. For if\nMcDaniel is right, then that principle is at best an a\nposteriori truth, though perhaps still a necessary truth. (See\nSimons (1994a, 2004a) for further discussion of bosons and for related\nconsiderations in support of interpenetration. For further discussion\nof Hawthorne and Uzquiano, see Cotnoir (2016).)\n",
