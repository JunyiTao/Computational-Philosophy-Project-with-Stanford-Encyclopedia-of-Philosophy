    "main_text": "Classical Theories of the Doctrine of Atonement || Penal Substitution\n4.4 Penal Substitution\n\nPenal substitution has been defended by many in the Reformed and more\nbroadly evangelical tradition. It has strong roots in Luther and\nCalvin; there has been considerable debate about whether there are\nearlier\n precursors.[40]\n On this view Christ, instead of paying satisfaction for human sin,\nsuffers punishment on behalf of humans for human sin. God\u2019s\njustice is thus satisfied, enabling God and humans to be reconciled\n(Schreiner 2006a).\n\nWilliam Lane Craig, however, defines the view more broadly\n\n\nas the doctrine that God inflicted upon Christ the suffering that we\ndeserved as the punishment for our sins, as a result of which we no\nlonger deserve punishment. (2020: 147)\n\n\nOn this definition one could hold that Christ was not punished; he\nmerely experienced sufferings that would have constituted punishment\nif we mere humans had endured them. Somehow, though, in virtue of his\nenduring these sufferings, \u201cwe no longer deserve\npunishment\u201d. How could that be? One option is to say that we\nmere humans are punished through Christ enduring these sufferings. M.\nMurphy (2009) calls this a \u201cvicarious punishment\u201d view,\nwhich he distinguishes from penal substitution. A second option is to\nsay that the debt of punishment is a collective debt humanity owes to\nGod and that Christ, through his death, pays it on behalf of the human\ncommunity. Humanity is punished, but Christ is not, on this view\n(Thurow 2015). A third option is to say that nobody is punished. Hard\ntreatment can be endured by an innocent third party\u2014and this\nisn\u2019t regarded as punishment of the third party or anyone\nelse\u2014in virtue of which the guilty party\u2019s debt of\npunishment is canceled (Quinn 1994: 298). We can call this the\n\u201cpenal cancellation\u201d view.\n\nAdvocates of penal substitution tend to defend it on three grounds.\nFirst, they argue that a proper interpretation of scripture demands a\npenal substitutionary view (see, e.g., Craig 2020; S. Jeffrey et al.\n(2007); Schreiner 2006a; Stott 1986). This claim has been widely\ncontested (see, e.g., Belousek-Snyder 2011; Eberhart 2011). Second,\nthey accept something like what Purtill (1990) calls \u201cstrict\nretributionism\u201d\u2014the demands of justice require that proper\npunishment be delivered\u2014alongside the idea that if mere humans\nreceived this justice they would be separated from God forever in\neternal damnation. Strict retributionism has also been widely\ncontested (see, e.g., Purtill 1990). Third, some (Porter 2002; 2004)\nreject strict retributionism in favor of what we might call\n\u201cpenal goodness\u201d\u2014it is good for sinners to be\npunished, even if they have repented, apologized, and made reparation,\nas it sends a message about the seriousness of sin. Although\nGod\u2019s justice does not require that he punish sinners, because\nof this good aspect of punishment, he does\n punish.[41]\n\nPenal substitution faces a host of objections. Some of the objections\nto satisfaction theory also target penal\n substitution.[42]\n Others specifically target penal substitution; three have been\nparticularly influential.\n\nOne objection is that penal substitution is incoherent because\npunishment necessarily expresses condemnation of the person punished,\nbut Christ surely is not condemned when he suffers and dies on the\ncross.\n Section 2.8\n above discusses this objection and some replies. Here one further\nreply should be mentioned. Some defenders of penal substitution, such\nas the Reformed theologian Turretin, believe that human sins are\nimputed to Christ\u2014that is, Christ is treated legally as if he\nhad sinned, or human guilt for sin is transferred or replicated in\nChrist. If sins are imputed to Christ, then Christ may well be\ncondemned for sin since he then would at least bear guilt for human\nsin (Craig 2020: 161). Imputation has been objected to on the grounds\nthat there is no area of morality where imputation seems possible (M.\nMurphy 2009; Crisp 2020a. Craig replies that God, as the ultimate\nlawgiver, has sole authority to impute sins and so it isn\u2019t\nsurprising we don\u2019t accept it in other areas of morality or law.\nHe also finds analogies to imputation in our law from legal fictions\n(e.g., treating a ship as a person) and vicarious liability (e.g.,\nholding employers liable for acts done by employees in their role as\nemployees).\n\nA second objection is that, on the penal substitution view, justice\nisn\u2019t done because the full punishment isn\u2019t paid by the\nsubstitute. The full punishment due for sin, according to penal\nsubstitution, is eternal separation from God. However, Christ plainly\ndoes not suffer eternal separation from God.\n\nOne reply is that during and while dead, Christ endures enough\nsuffering to match the suffering of those eternally separated from God\n(Craig 2020: 209). However, the punishment for sin isn\u2019t just\nthe suffering\u2014it\u2019s the eternal separation. No amount of\nsuffering matches eternal separation (Stump 2018: 78). A second reply\nis that God, in his divine authority, may accept a lesser punishment\nin place of full punishment (Turretin\n 1978).[43]\n\nThe third objection is perhaps the most influential: penal\nsubstitution of the sort supposedly involved in the atonement is\nimmoral. Perhaps an innocent person paying a guilty person\u2019s\npenal fine is morally acceptable, but punishment that involves hard\ntreatment such as the death penalty, imprisonment, and lashings cannot\nbe justly leveled upon an innocent, even willing, third party. We do\nnot have the hint of an intuition that it would be just, say, for an\ninnocent mother to willingly take on the death penalty due her son for\nmurder.\n\nOne reply is that God in his authority\u2014in virtue of divine\ncommand theory\u2014can accept what he will to fulfill justice. If he\nchooses to accept a substitute, then that is just (Craig 2020:\n 177).[44]\n The second reply is that, although penal substitution is rarely\njustified, there are plausible conditions in which it would be\njustified and in the case of human sin and Christ being God incarnate,\nthose conditions are met (Strabbing 2016).\n",
