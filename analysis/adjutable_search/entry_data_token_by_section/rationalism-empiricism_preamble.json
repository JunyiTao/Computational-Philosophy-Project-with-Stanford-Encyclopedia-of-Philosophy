    "main_text": "\n\nIn its most general terms, the dispute between rationalism and\nempiricism has been taken to concern the extent to which we are\ndependent upon experience in our effort to gain knowledge of the\nexternal world. It is common to think of experience itself as being of\ntwo kinds: sense experience, involving our five world-oriented senses,\nand reflective experience, including conscious awareness of our mental\noperations. The distinction between the two is drawn primarily by\nreference to their objects: sense experience allows us to acquire\nknowledge of external objects, whereas our awareness of our mental\noperations is responsible for the acquisition of knowledge of our\nminds. In the dispute between rationalism and empiricism, this\ndistinction is often neglected; rationalist critiques of empiricism\nusually contend that the latter claims that all our ideas originate\nwith sense experience.\n\nIt is generally agreed that most rationalists claim that there are\nsignificant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained\nindependently of sense experience. To be a rationalist, however, does\nnot require one to claim that our knowledge is acquired independently\nof any experience: at its core, the Cartesian Cogito\ndepends on our reflective, intuitive awareness of the existence of\noccurrent thought. Rationalists generally develop their view in two\nsteps. First, they argue that there are cases where the content of our\nconcepts or knowledge outstrips the information that sense experience\ncan provide. Second, they construct accounts of how reason, in some\nform or other, provides that additional information about the external\nworld.\n\nMost empiricists present complementary lines of thought. First, they\ndevelop accounts of how experience alone -- sense experience,\nreflective experience, or a combination of the two -- provides the\ninformation that rationalists cite, insofar as we have it in the first\nplace. Second, while empiricists attack the rationalists\u2019\naccounts of how reason is a primary source of concepts or knowledge,\nthey show that reflective understanding can and usually does supply\nsome of the missing links (famously, Locke believed that our idea of\nsubstance, in general, is a composite idea, incorporating elements\nderived from both sensation and reflection, e.g. Essay,\n2.23.2).\n\nThe distinction between rationalism and empiricism is not without\nproblems. One of the main issues is that almost no author falls neatly\ninto one camp or another: it has been argued that Descartes, for\ninstance, who is commonly regarded as a representative rationalist (at\nleast with regard to metaphysics), had clear empiricist leanings\n(primarily with regard to natural philosophy, where sense experience\nplays a crucial role, according to Clarke 1982). Conversely, Locke,\nwho is thought to be a paradigmatic empiricist, argued that reason is\non equal footing with experience, when it comes to the knowledge of\ncertain things, most famously of moral truths (Essay,\n4.3.18). In what follows, we clarify what this distinction has\ntraditionally been taken to apply to, as well as point out its (by\nnow) widely-recognized shortcomings.\n",
