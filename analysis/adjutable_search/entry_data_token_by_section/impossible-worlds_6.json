    "main_text": "Applications of Impossible Worlds || Counterpossible Reasoning\n2.5 Counterpossible Reasoning\n\nPerhaps the most important application of impossible worlds has to do\nwith counterpossible reasoning, understood as counterfactual reasoning\nfrom impossible antecedents. As we saw in\n section 1,\n this kind of reasoning is often taken to provide independent\nmotivation for believing in impossible worlds. (For a recent overview\nof the literature on counterpossibles, see Kocurek 2021.) In\nLewis-Stalnaker theories of counterfactuals, a conditional of the\nform, \u201cif it were the case that \\(A\\), then it would be the case\nthat \\(B\\)\u201d is true if and only if, at the closest world (or\nclosest worlds) at which \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is also true. (This is a\nsimplification of the truth conditions provided in the full-fledged\nsemantics of Lewis 1973.)\n\nWhile the standard conditional logics based on this idea have been\nquite successful in the treatment of counterfactuals, the approach\nentails that any counterfactual whose antecedent is impossible is\nvacuously true. For if there are no possible worlds at which \\(A\\) is\ntrue, then trivially, all closest \\(A\\)-worlds (worlds where \\(A\\) is\ntrue) are \\(B\\)-worlds. This is unsatisfying in many respects, for we\noften need to reason nontrivially about theories that (perhaps\nunbeknownst to us) cannot possibly be correct; and we often need to\nreason from antecedents that may turn out to be not only false, but\nnecessarily so. (Compare the conditionals (1.1) and (1.2) in\n section 1\n for an example.) Recent defences of the view that counterpossibles\nare not all vacuously true include Send\u0142ak 2021 and McLoone\n2021.\n\nThree contexts in which theories of this kind show up are discourses\non (1) alternative logics, (2) mathematical conjectures, and (3)\nmetaphysical views. We will now say a few words on each of them.\n\n(1) A famous Quinean motto has it that \u201cto change the logic is\nto change the subject\u201d: apparently disagreeing logical parties\nare actually speaking of different things. So when intuitionists deny\nthat the Law of Excluded Middle holds in non-finitary contexts, they\nare actually changing the meaning of logical operators; when\nparaconsistentists claim that some formula can be true (in some weird\ncircumstances) together with its negation, they are not talking of\nnegation anymore (see e.g., Berto 2008).\n\nBut this does not make good sense of many disputes between\nintuitionists, classical logicians, paraconsistentists, quantum\nlogicians, etc. It is more fruitful to assume that each party\ngenerally understands the rival logics as intelligible, albeit\nnecessarily false, theories. Even if classical logic actually is the\none true logic, one can reason counterpossibly about what would be the\ncase if a certain non-classical logic were the correct one (e.g.,\n\u201cif intuitionistic logic were correct, then the Law of Excluded\nMiddle would fail\u201d is true and \u201cif intuitionistic logic\nwere correct, then the Law of Explosion would fail\u201d is false).\nOne can take into account situations in which the Law of Excluded\nMiddle fails and argue about what would and would not be the case in\nthem. These situations are, by classical standards, just impossible\nworlds (of the third kind: Classical Logic Violators).\n\n(2) Similar claims can be made for mathematical conjectures. Different\nset theorists have different views on controversial subjects such as\nnon-well-founded sets, the\n Continuum Hypothesis,\n the Axiom of Choice, the set/(proper-)class distinction, etc. If one\nembraces the Platonic view (subscribed to, at least implicitly, by\nmany set theorists) that there is One True Universe of sets, then at\nmost one of the alternative set theories can be correct: the others\nare wrong, and necessarily so. But people can work under the\nhypothesis that a necessarily false basic mathematical principle\nholds, and reason coherently from this:\n\nIt is doubtless true that nothing sensible can be said about how\nthings would be different if there were no number 17; that is largely\nbecause the antecedent of this counterfactual gives us no hints as to\nwhat alternative mathematics is to be regarded as true in the\ncounterfactual situation in question. If one changes the example to\n\u201cNothing sensible can be said about how things would be\ndifferent if the axiom of choice were false\u201d, it seems wrong\n\u2026 : if the axiom of choice were false, the cardinals\nwouldn\u2019t be linearly ordered, the Banach-Tarski theorem would\nfail and so forth. (Field 1989: 237\u20138)\n\n\nField takes this as an argument to the effect that mathematical\nnecessity is not coextensive with logical necessity. But we can turn\nthe tables around: mathematical necessity is unrestricted and false\nmathematical theories are just impossible theories.\n\n(3) The third area in which counterpossible reasoning comes into play\nare metaphysical disputes (and more broadly, any philosophical dispute\nwhose subject matter is necessarily true or necessarily false). Much\nmetaphysical talk is made with our quantifiers \u201cwide\nopen\u201d, that is, aiming at stating truths about all that there\nwas, is, or could possibly be. This is evident in modal ontology, when\npeople advance a theory on the totality of worlds and on their nature.\nBut other metaphysical debates easily come to mind. Suppose a\nphilosopher wants to evaluate metaphysical theories which she\nconsiders wrong (say, in order to draw unpalatable consequences by way\nof criticism), such as Spinoza\u2019s monism or Hegel\u2019s\nmetaphysics of the Absolute. She must envisage situations where such\nmetaphysics are correct and wonder what would be the case according to\nthem: situations at which there is only one substance, or at which the\nAbsolute Geist necessarily shapes the teleological\ndevelopment of history. These situations will be, under the hypotheses\nwe have made, impossible worlds.\n\nCounterpossible reasoning may also show up in philosophical analyses\nof various kinds. For example, Boris Kment (2014) has proposed an\naccount of modal notions which grounds them in explanatory reasoning,\nin particular of the counterfactual kind. To account for non-trivial\ncounterpossibles, Kment uses impossible worlds taken as as collections\nof structured Russellian propositions.\n\nSemantic structures for counterfactual conditionals involving\nimpossible worlds were first introduced by Routley 1989, and have been\nproposed e.g. by Read 1995, Mares and Fuhrmann 1995, Mares 1997, Nolan\n1997, Brogaard and Salerno 2013, Bjerring 2014, Berto et al. 2018.\nMost of these are natural extensions of Lewis\u2019s 1973 semantics\nfor counterfactuals and capture several intuitions about\ncounterpossible reasoning. The main task for such theories consists in\naccounting for the concepts of closeness and qualitative similarity\nbetween worlds once impossible worlds enter the stage. How to\nfine-tune these notions is not a trivial matter (for an extensive\ndiscussion, see Vander Laan 2004; we will say more in\n section 4.2).\n\nNon-trivial treatments of counterpossibles require the failure of\nseveral logical principles which hold in the standard Lewis-Stalnaker\napproach to counterfactuals (Williamson 2007 chapter 5, Brogaard and\nSalerno 2013). (Williamson uses these failures to argue that\ncounterpossibles are always trivially true.) One important principle\nthat fails is the entailment from a strict conditional, \u201cif\n\\(A\\) then-strictly \\(B\\)\u201d, to the corresponding counterfactual,\n\u201cif it were the case that \\(A\\) then it would be the case that\n\\(B\\)\u201d. Normally, the former entails the latter. A strict\nconditional is true when all the (accessible) possible worlds where\nthe antecedent is true also make the consequent true. If all the\npossible \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds, then in particular all the\nclosest possible \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds. In an account which\nadmits impossible worlds, however, we can have closest impossible\nworlds where \\(A\\) obtains and \\(B\\) fails, making the counterpossible\nfalse even though the corresponding strict conditional is true.\n\nThe ensuing anarchy can be mitigated to some extent, e.g., by assuming\nwhat Nolan 1997 calls the Strangeness of Impossibility\nCondition (SIC): any possible world, however weird, should be\ncloser to any possible world \\(w\\) than any impossible world is to\n\\(w\\). Reality will be turned upside down before logical laws or\nmathematical truths abandon us. Then it is plausible that the\nLewis-Stalnaker principles will still hold whenever the relevant\nantecedent is possible. For then we will consider only the\nclosest antecedent-worlds when we evaluate the conditional, all of\nwhich will be possible worlds: the impossible ones will be too far\naway (Berto et al. 2018).\n",
