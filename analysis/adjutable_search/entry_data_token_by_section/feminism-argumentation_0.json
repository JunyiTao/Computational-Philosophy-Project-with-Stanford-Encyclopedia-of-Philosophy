    "main_text": "Arguing to Win\n1. Arguing to Win\n\nTheories about arguing generally assume that arguers disagree, and\nsometimes arguing operates as a type of battle among ideas that may be\npreferred over physical combat among people. Adversarial orientation\namong people arguing may, however, marginalize women\u2019s patterns\nof communication and discount social norms of \u201cfemininity\u201d\n(that regularly attach to women and girls but vary across time and\nculture). The connection between \u201cmasculinity\u201d (understood\nalso as a social norm, ideal, or role) and adversarial processes for\nreasoning may be heightened and even become stylized as a disciplinary\nmethod in contemporary Euro-American philosophy (Moulton 1983; Burrow\n2010; Rooney 2010; Alcoff\n 2013).[1]\n When reasoners treat arguing as a contest, each aiming to win by\ndefeating the other\u2019s claim, it can become\n\u201ceristic\u201d, which is to say that the goal of winning takes\nover from other purposes that arguing serves. In the same way as\nadversarial reasoning and eristics, other discursive norms can\ncomplicate the ways that women may be marginalized and marginalize\nother groups of people, including men. Little attention has been given\nin Euro-American philosophy to the gendered dimensions of arguing in\nother cultures. However, feminists regularly suggest that where\nadversarial arguing dominates, non-dominant styles of reasoning can\nprovide productive alternatives or complements to it, and this often\ninvolves styles gendered as \u201cfeminine\u201d.\n\nSome feminist philosophers suggest that an aggressive culture\nassociated with masculinity poorly serves processes of reasoning and\nhinders the discipline of philosophy insofar as it sidelines,\ndowngrades, and even excludes people\u2019s non-adversarial\nengagement with each other and with each other\u2019s reasoning.\nEvidence for this problem emerges in various places, beginning with\nthe prevalence of military and aggressive language to describe\nphilosophical discourse and rational arguing more generally (Lakoff\n& Johnson 1980; Ayim 1988; Cohen 1995).\n\nJanice Moulton (1983) argues that a particular style she calls\n\u201cthe Adversary Method\u201d dominates the discipline of\nphilosophy, and this goes beyond a set of attitudes or styles of\ninteraction to include prioritizing a particular discursive logic.\nFurther evidence for Moulton\u2019s characterization of disciplinary\npractices in philosophy comes from Phyllis Rooney (2012) and Catherine\nHundleby (2010).\n",
