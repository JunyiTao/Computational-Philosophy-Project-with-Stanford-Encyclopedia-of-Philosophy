    "main_text": "Chan and the Nature of Reality\n3. Chan and the Nature of Reality\n\nChan iconoclasm seems to have been largely rhetorical insofar as the\ntargets of Chan invective shifted from teacher to teacher and from\ngeneration to generation, and insofar as Chan teachings and practices\ndid not generally evidence anything like the radical breaks from\nBuddhist tradition that famous Chan texts like the thirteenth-century\nGateless Barrier (Wumenguan, \u7121\u9580\u95dc) might\nsuggest. On the contrary, daily life in Chan communities followed\nstandard Chinese monastic precedents and even in the writings\nassociated with the Hongzhou lineage of Mazu, renowned for his use of\nphysical \u201cshock tactics\u201d like kicking and punching,\nreferences to works in the Buddhist canon are quite common. Among the\nkey texts frequently invoked by Chan teachers were the\nVimalak\u012brti Sutra, the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a Sutra, the Flower\nOrnament Sutra, the Lotus Sutra, the Lank\u0101vatar\u0101 Sutra, and\nvarious Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 texts like the Diamond\nSutra.\n\nThe nature of reality as depicted in these texts, and for the most\npart assumed as valid in Chan circles, does not fit comfortably into\nsuch customary Western philosophical categories as idealism,\nmaterialism and dualism. Common to all Buddhist traditions are the\nteachings of interdependence and karma. Strongly interpreted, to claim\nthat all things arise and abide interdependently is to claim that\nrelationality is ontologically more basic than\n\u201cthings-being-related\u201d. That is, interdependence is not a\ncontingent, external relation among essentially separate entities; it\nis internal or constitutive. As it came to be understood in China,\ninterdependence entails interpenetration and individual existents are\nthus abstractions from already ongoing relational dynamics. Existence\nis relationality.\n\nThis strong reading was reinforced in China by indigenous Confucian\nand Daoist conceptions of a thing\u2019s nature (xing,\n\u6027) as dispositional and of the world as an auto-poetic or\nself-creating (ziran, \u81ea\u7136) system of\ncontinually-evolving relational patterns (dao,\n\u9053)\u2014not a divine creation, an objective determinant of\nuniversal physical laws, or a material expression of transcendent\nprinciples. These indigenous Chinese conceptions of reality resonated\nwell with Buddhist notions of interdependence and impermanence. But\nBuddhism added to them the teaching of karma, directing attention to\nthe dramatic character of phenomenal reality.\n\nStated as a conditional, the Buddhist teaching of karma is that if we\npay close and sustained enough attention to the dynamics of our\nexperience, a meticulous consonance becomes manifest between the\ncomplexion of our own values, intentions and actions, and the patterns\nof outcomes and opportunities we are experiencing. In short, all\nexperienced realities imply responsibility. But because our values,\nintentions and actions are always open to revision, all experienced\nrealities also express opportunities for responsively altering the\ncharacter and disposition of the relational dynamics that constitute\nus as persons and as communities.\n\nOne objection to this view of reality is that, if the world is\nself-generating and without any specific point or moment of origin, if\nwe are truly relational and thus ultimately intergenerational beings,\nand if experience is karmically-conditioned, how is enlightenment or\nliberation from conflict, trouble and suffering possible? If we have\nhad an infinite amount of time to act with ill intent or in accord\nwith misguided and perhaps conflicting values, do we not have an\ninfinite amount of troubling experiential consequences to work\nthrough\u2014an infinite burden of \u201cbad\u201d karma to bear\nand eventually suffer and make good on?\n\nFor the historical Buddha, the answer was quite simple: it is karma\nitself that makes the realization of liberation possible. We may not\nbe able to change what we have done in the past, but at this\nvery moment we can change the meaning of what we have done,\nestablishing a new dramatic trajectory that carries us beyond the\nreach of much of what we otherwise would have been\n\u201cdestined\u201d to experience. Thus, although the serial killer\nAngulim\u0101la did experience some violence from villagers affected\nby his prior rampages after having met the Buddha, become a monk, and\npracticed well enough to realize liberation, being pummeled with small\nstones and rotten fruit was minor suffering in comparison to what\notherwise was due him based on his ruthless and proud slaughter of\ndozens of people (Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, no. 86).\n\nAs Xuanzang\u2019s arduous journey to India and the controversy\nmotivating it make clear, however, not all Buddhists were satisfied by\nthis explanation. After all, the Buddha was the greatest of all\nteachers and this was clearly a factor in his disciples\u2019\nabilities to realize liberation under his guidance. Indeed, the body\nof literature detailing the Buddha\u2019s prior lives (the Jataka\nTales) portrays the Buddha\u2019s closest disciples as having\ntraveled with him over time as members of an ensemble of\n\u201ccharacters\u201d in a drama of liberation playing out over\ndozens of lifetimes. What of less karmically fortunate people living a\nhundred or a thousand years after the Buddha had died? If all beings\nhave \u201cno-self\u201d or abiding essence, if all things are\ncharacterized by emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) or the\nabsence of any intrinsic nature\u2014basic teachings of both early\nand later Buddhist traditions\u2014and if we have been living the\nignorance-biased lives of \u201csinners\u201d rather than\n\u201csaints\u201d, how is liberation ever possible? Without the\nlive guidance of a teacher like the Buddha, the possibility of\nenlightenment would seem to be purely theoretical.\n\nOne response to this\u2014variously expressed in a range of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na texts and variously understood by those\ninterpreting them as Buddhism spread from India through Central Asia\nand into China\u2014was that all sentient beings have\n\u201cwithin\u201d them a \u201cseed\u201d or \u201cembryo\u201d\n(garbha) of enlightenment: the innate capacity to be like the\nBuddha himself, a \u201cthus come one\u201d\n(t\u0101thagatha). Texts espousing some version of this\nt\u0101thagatha-garbha thesis\u2014the\nNirv\u0101\u1e47a, \u015arim\u0101l\u0101devimhan\u0101da and\nLank\u0101vatar\u0101 sutras, for example, and the apocryphal\ncommentary, the Awakening of Mahayana Faith\u2014became some of the\nmost influential Buddhist texts in China, and especially in the\ndevelopment of Chan. Many of these texts also drew connections between\nt\u0101thagatha-garbha teachings and the notion of\nbuddhadh\u0101tu, literally \u201cbuddha-element\u201d,\n\u201cbuddha-substance\u201d or \u201cbuddha-realm\u201d. This\nconcept seems to have developed through a merger of justifications for\nrelic veneration practices and assertions about the originally\nluminous nature of the mind that are found in both very early\nPali-language and Mahayana Buddhist texts. These texts maintain that\nmind is originally pure and that it only appears impure because of\nexperiential pollutants (kle\u015bas) caused by actions\nundertaken in ignorance or out of anger, hatred and greed. This idea\nof the original luminosity of mind was seemingly grafted onto the idea\nof an ineradicable \u201celement\u201d or \u201csubstance\u201d\n(dh\u0101tu) of enlightened being, eventually resulting in\nclaims that all sentient beings have already within them a seed of\nenlightenment\u2014a luminous capacity for awakening\n(budh).\n\nFor some Buddhists, the \u201csubstantial\u201d character of this\ncapacity seemed to imply the presence in each of us of a \u201ctrue\nself\u201d\u2014not the egoistic self that appears as a function of\nignorance, habit formations and craving forms of desire, and that is\ndissolved through Buddhist training and the realization of no-self\n(anatman), but rather an unassailably aware core of\nbeing-present. In China, however, the term that was used to translate\nbuddhadh\u0101tu\u2014\u4f5b\u6027 or\nfo-xing\u2014opened other interpretative possibilities. In\ncontrast with the connotations of the Sanskrit dh\u0101tu,\nwhich has connotations ranging from an individual component of\nexistence to a realm of existents, fo-xing literally means\n\u201cBuddha-nature\u201d and carries with it dispositional or\nrelational accents deriving from the indigenous Chinese notion of\n\u201cnature\u201d (xing, \u6027). Thus, Buddha-nature\ncould be seen as a propensity for entering into enlightening forms of\nconduct and relationship, rather than as a substantial essence.\nBuddha-nature is not something hidden \u201cin\u201d each of us, but\nrather something that manifests as a distinctive pattern and quality\nof interactive conduct. Chan strenuously endorsed this interpretation,\nand illustrating it became the distinctive feature of the\ngong\u2019an (\u516c\u6848) or \u201cpublic case\u201d\nliterature of master-student encounters expressing the\n\u201cbone\u201d and \u201cmarrow\u201d of Chan: communicating the\nmeaning of enlightenment is not a matter of saying, but of\nshowing.\n\nJust as significantly, the Buddha-nature thesis also came to be allied\nwith teachings about nonduality that were found both in key\nt\u0101thagatha-garbha texts and in the profoundly\ninfluential Vimalak\u012brti Sutra. The key figure of this sutra is a\nlayman, Vimalak\u012brti, who feigns illness as a pretext for being\nvisited by the Buddha\u2019s key disciples and other eminent Buddhist\nfigures\u2014each of whom he engages and surpasses in sophisticated\ndebate about core Mahayana concepts and practices. The sutra climaxes\nboth dramatically and philosophically when the bodhisattva of wisdom,\nMa\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b, asks Vimalak\u012brti to explain the\nmeaning of nonduality and Vimalak\u012brti responds by simply\nremaining silently and unwaveringly present.\n\nIn the history of Western and certain branches of Indian philosophy,\nclaims about nonduality have often taken the form of monistic\nchallenges to metaphysical dualisms asserting the incommensurability\nof, for example, mind and body or spirit and matter. Nondualism denies\nthe presence of the implied ontological gap separating these\nconstituents of reality, asserting instead that everything is\n(ultimately) one or the same. Buddhist nondualism, as it came to be\nunderstood in China, does not involve an erasure of difference or a\ndenial of its reality, but rather a restoration of the otherwise\n\u201cexcluded ground\u201d between \u201cbeing\u201d and\n\u201cnonbeing\u201d.\n\nThe great Indian Buddhist thinker, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (c.\n150\u2013250 CE), set the stage for this conception of nonduality by\nfamously pointing out the logical inconsistencies of reality claims\nabout being; nonbeing; both being and nonbeing; and neither being nor\nnonbeing. Blending early Buddhist insights into interdependence and\nthe Mahayana conception of emptiness\n(\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nMadhyamaka philosophy stressed the unreality of svabh\u0101va\nor \u201cown being\u201d to advance what he described as a\n\u201cmiddle path\u201d between existence and non-existence that\noffered an alternative to both dualism and monism, but also to any\npluralisms affirming the ultimate reality of some (perhaps indefinite)\nnumber of independent existents. This logical approach to the Middle\nWay had powerful impacts on the development of Chinese Buddhism. But\nit was seen by some as offering an apophatic or negative nonduality\nthat, while successful in undermining metaphysical foundationalism,\ndid little to address ethical and more broadly karmic concerns or to\nsupport the bodhisattva ideal of resolutely compassionate wisdom.\nConceptually linking emptiness and Buddha-nature opened possibilities\nfor a relationally positive nondualism consistent with the\nvalorization of meaning-generating mutual responsiveness.\n\nWith great impact on the development of Chan, this was the approach\ntaken by the Chinese Huayan thinker, Fazang (643\u2013712). Although\nproponents of Chan often stressed its distinctiveness, Chan monastics\nlived in community with monks and nuns who had allegiances to other\nBuddhist traditions. Indeed, rather than being a source of doctrinal\nschisms, the scriptural commentaries and philosophical essays being\nproduced by thinkers from the full range of Buddhist traditions can be\nthought of as constituting a shared scaffolding for engagement in\n\u201cBuddhist studies\u201d. Fazang was among the most respected\nBuddhist intellectuals of his time. In contrast with those who\nunderstood the Mah\u0101y\u0101na assertion of the emptiness\n(\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) of all things as an assertion about\nthe absence or negation of identity\u2014an assertion that denied\nultimate actuality to things as individual existents\u2014Fazang\nlinked realizing the emptiness of all things to realizing that\ninterdependence is an internal or constitutive relationship. That is,\ninterdependence consists in dynamic interpenetration. In a move that\nparalleled the description in the Awakening of Faith of the \u201cone\nmind\u201d (yixin, \u4e00\u5fc3) of ultimate reality as\nhaving two aspects\u2014ti (\u9ad4), \u201cembodied\nstructure\u201d and yong (\u7528)\n\u201cfunction\u201d\u2014Fazang held that the\ndharmadh\u0101tu or realm of truth/ultimate reality should be\nseen nondualistically in terms of both informing principles\n(li, \u7406) and phenomenal experiences (shi,\n\u4e8b). That is the dharmadh\u0101tu or realm of\ntruth/ultimate reality is at once a realm of shi or\nexperiential matters (\u4e8b\u6cd5\u754c, shi fajie); a\nrealm of li or informing patterns/principles\n(\u7406\u6cd5\u754c, li fajie); a realm of the mutual\nnon-obstruction of li and shi\n(\u7406\u4e8b\u7121\u7919\u6cd5\u754c, li-shi wuai\nfajie); and a realm of the mutual non-obstruction of shi\nand shi (\u4e8b\u4e8b\u7121\u7919\u6cd5\u754c,\nshi-shi wuai fajie). Thus, very much in keeping with the fact\nthat the Sanskrit term, \u201cdharma\u201d, can mean a specific\nexistent, a phenomenal unit or a teaching, the nonduality of the\ndharmadh\u0101tu implies a relationship of mutual\ndetermination between the domains of metaphysics and epistemology.\n\nTo help clarify the significance of this, Fazang made metaphorical use\nof a traditional, timber-framed building that is held together without\nany fasteners by the compressing force of gravity on all of its parts\n(Huayan wujiao zhang, in Taish\u014d shinsh\u014d\ndaiz\u016bkyu, Vol. 45, no. 1866). Removing the clay roofing tiles and\ntheir immense weight would destabilize such a building, eventually\ncausing it to collapse. But the roofing tiles are placed on top of\npurlins that are placed perpendicularly on rafters resting on a\ncentral ridge beam and on rim joists that are themselves resting on\ncolumns placed atop individual foundation stones. Since removing the\nroofing tiles of such a structure would cause the entire building to\ncollapse, the tiles can be said to be the cause of the totality of the\nbuilding. But the same is true for all of the other parts of the\nbuilding. Similarly, each particular in the world (shi)\nconsists at once in causing and being caused by the dynamic patterning\n(li) of the totality of all things. Each thing ultimately\nis what it means for all others.\n\nIt can be said, then, that all things are the same, but this is true\nonly insofar as each thing differs meaningfully from and for one\nanother. Nonduality does not mean that all things are reducible to\nsome common essence or substance, but rather that each thing or being\nis part of an emergent ecological matrix through which the\nfunctioning of each thing or being serves as a distinctive\ncause of the totality of the real. Reality ultimately\nconsists in dynamically evolving mutual contribution. The\ndharmadh\u0101tu is not something we have in common,\na foundational essence; it is something in which we each have a\ndistinct and indispensable contributory share. Thus,\nBuddha-nature is not an adamantine and ineradicable element of who we\nare; it consists in the uninterrupted expression of enlightened and\nenlightening relationality.\n\nChan embraced this account of nonduality and Buddha-nature, but\ndistinctively used it to qualify the meaning of Buddhist practice and\nthe personal ideal of the bodhisattva. In the Platform Sutra\nattributed to Huineng, he insists that\n\n\nmeditation is the embodiment (ti) of wisdom, and wisdom is\nthe functioning (yong) of meditation.\n\n\nThe point of Chan is to see one\u2019s own \u201coriginal\nnature\u201d (benxing, \u672c\u6027) and realize\n\u201cauthentic heartmind\u201d (zhenxin,\n\u771e\u5fc3), and in doing so the dualities of thought and\nreality, of passion and enlightenment, and of the impure and pure all\ndissolve. Then,\n\n\ntrue suchness (zhenru, \u771f\u5982) is the embodied\nstructure (ti) of thinking, while thinking is the functioning\n(yong) of true suchness. (Platform Sutra, 13\u201317)\n\n\nTo see our own original nature is to see that true suchness and\nthinking are as intimately related as the bodily structure of a horse\nand its customary activities. Just as the bodily structure of the\nhorse establishes the conditions of possibility for grazing and\ngalloping, it is only the proven evolutionary advantage of grazing and\ngalloping in horse-like ways that have made this bodily structure\npossible. True suchness or ultimate reality is not a preexistent\nsomething \u201cout there\u201d that can be grasped intellectually\nor accessed through some mystical vision; it can only be enacted.\n\nHuangbo Xiyun (d. 850) describes this as demonstrating\nno-\u201cmind\u201d (wuxin, \u7121\u5fc3) or freedom\nfrom conceptual impositions that would define or limit reality. But\nthis is not a lapse into mental blankness or indiscriminate presence.\nRealizing no-\u201cmind\u201d restores our originally whole mind\n(yixin, \u4e00\u5fc3) that Huangbo qualifies as the\n\u201csilent bond\u201d (moqi, \u9ed8\u5951) of\n\u201cconducting oneself as all Buddhas have\u201d (in Taish\u014d\nshinsh\u014d daiz\u016bkyu, Vol.48, 2012.380b to 383c). Significantly,\nthe term \u201cqi\u201d originally referred to notches or\ntally marks on a strip of bamboo that record the terms of a trade\nagreement and the bonding that Huangbo invokes is thus one of mutually\nentrusted obligation and responsibility. True suchness consists in the\npersonification of the bodhisattva ideal of realizing liberating forms\nof relationality. Ultimate reality consists in enacting the\nmorally-inflected nonduality of wisdom and compassion.\n\nRegarding reality as a dynamically-manifested relational quality\nrather than as something to be \u201cknown\u201d or\n\u201cattained\u201d disposed Chan to valorize responsiveness as an\nindex of liberating presence. Thus, while Mazu iconoclastically\nproclaimed that \u201cordinary, everyday mind is Buddha\u201d\n(Xu zangjing, 119.406), he also identified this with\n\u201cresponding to situational dynamics and dealing with people as\nthey come\u201d, no matter where one is or with whom one is\ninteracting (Xu zangjing, 119.406). And Linji, founder of one\nof the two Chan lineages that have remained continuous to the present\nday, urged his students to become \u201ctrue persons of no\nrank\u201d (zhenren wuwei, \u771f\u4eba\u7121\u4f4d)\nwho refrain from taking any fixed position, improvising as needed in\nany situation to contribute to the emergence of enlightening\nrelational dynamics.\n",
