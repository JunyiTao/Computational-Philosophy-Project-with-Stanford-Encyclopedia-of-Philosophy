    "main_text": "The Rejection of Special Metaphysics and the Transcendental Dialectic\n2. The Rejection of Special Metaphysics and the Transcendental Dialectic\n\nKant\u2019s rejection of the more specialized branches of metaphysics\nis grounded in part on this earlier claim, to wit, that any attempt to\napply the concepts and principles of the understanding independently\nof the conditions of sensibility (i.e., any transcendental use of the\nunderstanding) is illicit. Thus, one of Kant\u2019s main complaints\nis that metaphysicians seek to deduce a priori synthetic\nknowledge simply from the unschematized (pure) concepts of the\nunderstanding. The effort to acquire metaphysical knowledge through\nconcepts alone, however, is doomed to fail, according to Kant, because\n(in its simplest formulation) \u201cconcepts without intuitions are\nempty\u201d (A52/B76).\n\nAlthough this general charge is certainly a significant part of\nKant\u2019s complaint, the story does not stop there. In turning to\nthe specific disciplines of special metaphysics (those concerning the\nsoul, the world, and God), Kant devotes a considerable amount of time\ndiscussing the human interests that nevertheless pull us into the\nthorny questions and controversies that characterize special\nmetaphysics. These interests are of two types, and include theoretical\ngoals of achieving completeness and systematic unity of knowledge, and\npractical interests in securing the immortality of the soul, freedom,\nand the existence of God. Despite their contributions to metaphysical\nillusion, Kant tells us that the goals and interests in question are\nunavoidable, inevitable, and inherent in the very nature of human\nreason. In the Introduction to the Transcendental Dialectic Kant thus\nintroduces \u201creason\u201d as the locus of these metaphysical\ninterests.\n",
