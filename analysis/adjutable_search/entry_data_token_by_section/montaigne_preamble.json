But in\nthe Essays, his aim is above all to exercise his own\njudgment properly.  Readers who might want to convict him of ignorance\nwould find nothing to hold against him, he said, for he was exerting\nhis natural capacities, not borrowed ones. He thought that too much\nknowledge could prove a burden, preferring to exert his \u201cnatural\njudgment\u201d to displaying his erudition.  \n",
