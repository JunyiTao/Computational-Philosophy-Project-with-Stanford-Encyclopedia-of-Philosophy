But Kant tells us that it is\nunnecessary to subject mathematics to such a critique because the use\nof pure reason in mathematics is kept to a \u201cvisible track\u201d\nvia intuition: \u201c[mathematical] concepts must immediately be\nexhibited in concreto in pure intuition, through which\nanything unfounded and arbitrary instantly becomes obvious\u201d\n(A711/B739). Nevertheless, the practice and discipline of mathematics\ndoes require an explanation, in order both to account for its success\nat demonstrating substantive and necessary truths, and also to license\nits invocation as a model of reasoning. Kant thus directs himself, as\nhe did in the pre-critical period, to the question of what accounts\nfor the \u201chappy and well grounded\u201d mathematical method, and\nalso of whether it is useful in any discipline other than mathematics.\nTo answer this latter question in the negative, Kant must explain the\nuniqueness of mathematical reasoning.\n\nThe central thesis of Kant\u2019s account of the uniqueness of\nmathematical reasoning is his claim that mathematical cognition\nderives from the \u201cconstruction\u201d of its concepts: \u201cto\nconstruct a concept means to exhibit a\npriori the intuition corresponding to it\u201d (A713/B741)\n(Friedman 1992, 2010; Shabel 2006). For example, while the concept\n<triangle> can be discursively defined as a rectilinear figure\ncontained by three straight lines (as is done in Euclid\u2019s\nElements), the concept is constructed, in\nKant\u2019s technical sense of the term, only when a\ncorresponding intuition is exhibited; in this case, the corresponding\nintuition is a singular and immediately evident representation of\na three-sided figure. Kant argues that when one so renders a triangle\nfor the purposes of performing the auxiliary constructive steps\nnecessary for geometric proof, one does so a priori, whether\nthe triangle is produced on paper or only in the imagination. This is\nbecause in neither case does the object displayed borrow its pattern\nfrom any experience (A713/B741). Moreover, one can derive universal\ntruths about all triangles from such a singular display of an\nindividual triangle since the particular determinations of the\ndisplayed object, e.g., the magnitude of its sides and angles, are\n\u201centirely indifferent\u201d to the rendered triangle as an\nexhibition of the general concept <triangle> (A714/B742).\nKant\u2019s account must thus be defended against the commonly held\nposition that universal truths cannot be derived from\nreasoning that depends on particular representations (Friedman 2012,\n2020). Relatedly, the less than perfectly straight sides of an\nempirically rendered triangle are similarly \u201cindifferent\u201d\nto the general concept <triangle> and so such an empirical\nintuition is considered adequate for geometric proof. This raises\nquestions about how one can be sure that an intuition adequately\ndisplays the content of a concept (Dunlop 2012); the relation between\npure and empirical intuition (Friedman 2012; Shabel 2003); and,\nin particular, which of the intuitively displayed features can safely\nbe ignored (Friedman 2010, 2012). These features of Kant\u2019s\ntheory of construction also invite discussion about the acquisition\nconditions of mathematical concepts (Callanan 2014); the role of\nconstruction in indirect reductio proofs (Goodwin\n2018); the relation between construction and definition (Heis\n2014, 2020; Nunez 2014); and the role of imagination in construction\n(Land 2014).\n\nUltimately, Kant claims that it is \u201conly the concept of\nmagnitudes\u201d (quantities) that can be constructed in pure\nintuition, since \u201cqualities cannot be exhibited in anything but\nempirical intuition\u201d (A714/B742) (Sutherland 2004a, 2004b,\n2005a, 2021). This leads to a principled distinction between\nmathematical and philosophical cognition: while philosophical\ncognition is confined to the results of an abstract conceptual\nanalysis, mathematical cognition is the result of a \u201cchain of\ninferences that is always guided by intuition\u201d, that is, by a\nconcrete representation of its objects (Hintikka 1967; Parsons 1969;\nFriedman 1992; Hogan 2020). Kant strains somewhat to explain how the\nmathematician constructs arithmetic and algebraic magnitudes, which\nare distinct from the spatial figures that are the object of geometric\nreasoning. Drawing a distinction between \u201costensive\u201d and\n\u201csymbolic\u201d construction, he identifies ostensive\nconstruction with the geometer\u2019s practice of showing or\ndisplaying spatial figures, whereas symbolic construction correlates\nto the act of concatenating arithmetic or algebraic symbols (as when,\nfor example, \u201cone magnitude is to be divided by another,\n[mathematics] places their symbols together in accordance with the\nform of notation for division\u2026\u201d) (A717/B745) (Brittan\n1992; Shabel 1998).\n\nKant claims further that the pure concept of magnitude is suitable for\nconstruction because, unlike other pure concepts, it does not\nrepresent a synthesis of possible intuitions, but\n\u201calready contains a pure intuition in itself.\u201d But since\nthe only candidates for such \u201cpure intuitions\u201d are space\nand time (\u201cthe mere form of appearances\u201d), it follows that\nonly spatial and temporal magnitudes can be exhibited in pure\nintuition, i.e., constructed. Such spatial and temporal magnitudes can\nbe exhibited qualitatively, by displaying the shapes of things, e.g.\nthe rectangularity of the panes of a window, or they can be exhibited\nmerely quantitatively, by displaying the number of parts of things,\ne.g., the number of panes that the window comprises. In either case,\nwhat is displayed counts as a pure and \u201cformal intuition\u201d,\ninspection of which yields judgments that \u201cgo beyond\u201d the\ncontent of the original concept with which the intuition was\nassociated. Such judgments are paradigmatically synthetic a\npriori judgments (to be discussed at greater length below) since\nthey are ampliative truths that are warranted independent of\nexperience (Shabel 2006).\n\nKant argues that mathematical reasoning cannot be employed outside the\ndomain of mathematics proper for such reasoning, as he understands it,\nis necessarily directed at objects that are\n\u201cdeterminately given in pure intuition a priori and\nwithout any empirical data\u201d (A724/B752). Since only\nformal mathematical objects (i.e. spatial and temporal magnitudes) can\nbe so given, mathematical reasoning is useless with respect to\nmaterially given content (though the truths that result from\nmathematical reasoning about formal mathematical objects are\nfruitfully applied to such material content, which is to say that\nmathematics is applicable to and a priori true of the\nappearances (Shabel 2005). Consequently, the \u201cthorough\ngrounding\u201d that mathematics finds in its definitions, axioms,\nand demonstrations cannot be \u201cachieved or imitated\u201d by\nphilosophy or physical sciences (A727/B755).\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s theory of mathematical concept construction can be\nthought of as providing an explanation of mathematical practice as\nKant understood\n it[2],\n the theory is intertwined with Kant\u2019s broader commitments to\nstrict distinctions between intuitions and concepts, as modes of\nrepresentation (Smyth 2014); between synthetic and analytic judgments\n(Anderson 2004, 2015; Hogan 2020); between the roles of different\ncognitive faculties (Land 2014; Laywine 2014); and between a\npriori and a posteriori evidence and reasoning (Anderson\n2015). Ultimately, the picture of mathematics developed in the\n\u201cDiscipline of Pure Reason in Dogmatic Use\u201d depends on the\nfull theory of judgment that the Critical philosophy aims to\nprovide, and crucially on the theory of sensibility that Kant offers\nin The Transcendental Aesthetic (Parsons 1992; Carson 1997; Risjord\n1991), as well as in corresponding passages in the\nProlegomena\u2019s Main Transcendental Question, First Part,\nwhere he investigates the \u201corigin\u201d of the pure sensible\nconcepts of mathematics, and the \u201cscope of their validity\u201d\n (A725/B753).[3]\n",
