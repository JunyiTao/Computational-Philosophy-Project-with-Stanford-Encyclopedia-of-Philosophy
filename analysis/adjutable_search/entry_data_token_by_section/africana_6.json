More than a few African and African-descendant persons\nwould engage in concerted intellectual and practical actions directed against\nthe enterprise of enslavement in all of its forms. Their considerations\nand articulations can be found in various repositories of\nphilosophizings: in the lyrics and rhythmic structures and timings of\nvarious genres of music-making; in newspaper writings and pamphlets;\nin poetry and other modes of creative writing; in letters; in slave\nnarratives and autobiographies; in the legacies and documentary\nhistories of institutions, those of Black churches and church\ndenominations especially; in those of women\u2019s and men\u2019s\nservice organizations; in the documentary histories of conventions and\nconvention movements; etc. For from the earliest instances of the\nenslavement of Africans in the colonies in the 1600s and continuing\nthrough the 1800\u20131865 Civil War between forces of the Union of\nNorth and East and forces of the Confederacy of the South, militant\nagitation for the abolition of slavery was a prominent endeavor among\npersons of color both \u201cfree\u201d and enslaved, as were efforts\nto achieve greater respect and freedom for Black women from male\ndomination and oppression and from sexual exploitation as well as from\nracism. Phillis Wheatley (1753?-1784), a young, lettered house-slave\nin Boston, Massachusetts, wrote poems \u201con various subjects,\nreligious and moral,\u201d in one of which she expounded on the\nsignificance of \u201cBeing Brought from Africa to America\u201d and\nextolled Christians to remember that though Negroes be \u201cblack as\nCain,\u201d they, too, can be \u201crefin\u2019d and join th\u2019\nangelic train\u201d (Wheatley [1773] 1997). Aside from\nWheatley\u2019s highly polished and thoughtfully probing poetry,\nthe fact that she had penned the verses prompted such\ndisbelief that her master, and a prominent group of White men of the\ncity, including the governor and lieutenant governor of the state,\nfelt compelled to write letters to the publisher and the reading\npublic to attest that Wheatley had mastered the English language and\nwas, indeed, the author of the verses. Lettered articulation, in high\nverse no less, was a significant counter to claims of Negro\ninferiority, hence the need for legitimation of Wheatley\u2019s\nwritings by White persons of significant standing in order for those\nwritings to enter a race- and gender-constricted literary public\nsphere.\n\n\nWheatley was the first in what would become a long and continuing\nline of enslaved persons of African descent in the United States who\ntook up creative and other genres of writing as a means for engaging in\nresisting oppression and for reclaiming and exercising their humanity\nthrough thoughtful articulation. Slaves\u2019 narrations of the\nstories of their lives and of the conditions of enslavement and of their\naspirations and quests for freedom, constitute an extraordinarily rich\nbody of literature to be studied for philosophizings born of\nstruggles. Olaudah Equiano\u2019s The Interesting Narrative\nof the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African. Written\nby Himself (1789) is but one example of such narratives. Consider\ncarefully Equiano\u2019s recounting having to wrestle with and reclaim\nhis sense of self, even his name, after having been stolen into slavery\nas a child, transported to the New World, and being renamed\n\u201cGustavus Vassa.\u201d A profound and consequential instance of\nexistential philosophizing, Equiano\u2019s Narrative, one that discloses the significance of a\ncompelled struggle to reclaim and exercise a person\u2019s right, and\npower, of identification of self and social being\u2026\n\n\nFor a Negro, slave or free, to indulge in the articulation of\ncritical reflections on the nature of their being and the conditions of\ntheir life was a bold contradiction of prevailing characterizations of\nAfrican peoples and their descendants in the racialized ontologies of\nWhite Racial Supremacy, and a dangerous threat to the enterprise. David\nWalker (1785\u20131830) exemplified the threat. He sent shockwaves of fear\nacross the slaveholding South, especially, with the publication and\nwide distribution of his Appeal in Four Articles; Together with a\nPreamble, to the Coloured Citizens of the World, but in Particular and\nVery Expressly, to Those of the United States of America (1829) in\nwhich he advocated forcefully that Coloured people rise up in armed\nstruggle against their oppressors. Moreover, in articulating his\nprovocative appeal in a written document, Walker employed with great\nskill and impact a strategic use of rhetoric to gain leverage in the\npublic sphere: while ostensibly directing the Appeal to an\naudience of \u201cColoured Citizens\u201d almost none of whom were\nregarded as citizens and very few of whom, among those enslaved\ncertainly, could read and, if they could, would have been prohibited\nfrom getting their hands and minds on such an appeal, in truth was also\ndirected at White slaveowners and oppressors. This strategy would\nbecome a staple in the arsenal of discursive strategies Black folks would\nuse to engage in the work of articulating their considerations and\nadvocating for life-enhancing changes.\n\n\nFrederick Douglass (1817\u20131895), a passionate and indefatigable\nopponent of enslavement, the institution of slavery, and of the\nsubordination of women (\u201cWhat Are the Colored People Doing for\nThemselves?\u201d 1848; \u201cPrejudice Not Natural,\u201d 1849;\n\u201cThe Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered,\u201d\n1854), would use the strategy with superbly nuanced skill. An\nespecially brilliant thinker and prolific writer, he was also\nbrilliant in his oppositional eristic engagements over the\nconstitutional, biblical, and ethnological justifications of Negro\ninferiority and enslavement and over a wide range of other subjects,\nincluding the compelling need for appropriate education (directed at\npreparing the formerly enslaved for productive, economically\nself-sustaining labor), good character, and political equality.\nDouglass was an astute critical thinker and speech-maker, and was a\nforemost thinker with regard to such matters as the constitutionality\nof slavery, of the meanings of freedom and justice,\nand of the implications of both for enslaved, free, and freed Negroes\n(Douglass 1845).  Maria Stewart (1803\u20131879), likewise committed\nto freedom and justice for Black people, was a pioneering feminist in\nspeaking out publicly (\u201cReligion and the Pure Principles of\nMorality, the Sure Foundation on Which We Must Build,\u201d 1831) and\nthus took advantage of cracks in the public sphere to advance the\ncause for abolition and the liberation of women (Stewart\n1831). Sojourner Truth (Isabella Baumfree, 1797\u20131883) was a\nlegendary unlettered but unnervingly bodacious itinerant intellectual\nprovocateur who agitated for ending enslavement and the subordination\nof women (\u201cWoman\u2019s Rights,\u201d 1851). On one celebrated\noccasion, Truth walked uninvited into a Women\u2019s Rights\nConvention of assembled White people, sat down on the edge of the\nspeakers\u2019 stage until she simply had to be recognized, and then\ndelivered her now famous \u201cAr\u2019n\u2019t I a Woman?\u201d\nspeech (Truth 1851).\n\n\nIf slavery were abolished, what did the vocal Negro advocates think\nwould be the most appropriate modes and ends of life for Negro men and\nwomen?\n\n\nFor some it would or should involve assimilation, that is,\nprocesses by which one racial and/or ethnic group is absorbed by\nanother, for some physically as well as socio-culturally, with one\ngroup relinquishing its own racial and/or ethnic cultural\ndistinctiveness to take on the defining life-world character and\npractices of another. For early African American assimilationists this\nwould have meant accepting as appropriate and sufficient goals for\nAfrican American life the country\u2019s pronounced cultural, social,\npolitical, and economic ideals\u2014though generally without\nendorsements of the superiority of the White race\u2014as proof of\ntheir humaneness and of their having \u201crisen\u201d from a\ncondition of \u201csavagery\u201d to having become\n\u201ccivilized,\u201d particularly by having become\nChristianized.\n\n\nHowever, particular care must be taken in characterizing an engaged\nthinker\u2019s commitments and aspirations as\n\u201cassimilationist.\u201d While appropriate and useful in some\ninstances, in others the label is often misused or misplaced, for\nvarious thinkers were quite nuanced in articulating their positions on\nvarious matters: for example, in advocating assimilation of prevailing\neconomic ideas, principles, and practices while advocating social,\ncultural, and political independence for Black people. Douglass, one\nof the most well-known of African American cultural and political\nassimilationists, is an instructive example. He was not an advocate of\nthe assimilation of the Negro race into the White race; rather, he\npreferred, at the extreme, the assimilation of all distinct races into\na single, blended race, so to speak, so that there would no longer be\ndistinct races in which aspirations for super-ordination and\nsubordination could be invested. Similar views on cultural and\neconomic assimilation were articulated by T. Thomas Fortune\n(1856\u20131928), the journalist and advocate of Black unionizing and\npolitical independence (\u201cPolitical Independence of the\nNegro,\u201d 1884), and by the radical abolitionist Henry Highland\nGarnet (1815\u20131881), who at one point was convinced that\n\u201cThis western world is destined to be filled with a mixed\nrace\u201d (\u201cThe Past and the Present Condition and the\nDestiny of the Colored Race,\u201d (1848; 1996, p. 200), emphasis in\nthe original).\n\n\nOn the other hand, there were Negro women and men of the\nseventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries of enslavement for\nwhom the prospect of assimilating with White people in any fashion or\non any terms was to be firmly rejected. Such sentiments were especially\nprominent during the decades leading up to the Civil War as conditions\nbecame even more constraining for supposedly free-born and freedpersons\nwith the passage in 1850 of the Fugitive Slave Law that stripped away\nany legal protection for escaped and former slaves who made it to free\nstates by declaring it legal for any White person to apprehend any\nNegro who could not document their free status and return the person to\nenslavement. Garnet, responding to the circumstances the law created,\nis representative of those Black folks who became advocates of the\nemigration of Negro people to Africa. He was the founder of the African\nCivilization Society, an organization that promoted emigration of\nAmerican Negroes to Africa in keeping with a more positive agenda than\nwas the case with the American Colonization Society, which was\norganized by White people to foster the relocation of troublesome\nabolitionist free Negro people to Liberia, the colony founded with\nfederal support by White Americans intent on preserving the institution\nof slavery and White Racial Supremacy.\n\nEmigrationist considerations and projects thus became\nprominent ventures during this period, advocated with persuasive force\nby other very able activist thinkers, among them Edward Blyden\n(1832\u20131912), James T. Holly (1829\u20131911), and Martin Delany\n(1812\u20131883).  Delany\u2019s The Condition, Elevation,\nEmigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United\nStates (1852) was an especially well-reasoned critique of notions\nof citizen prevailing in the United States and a detailing of\nconditions affecting Colored people, including, in his estimation,\ntheir overreliance on \u201cmoral theorizing\u201d and not enough on\npragmatic political reasoning informed by comparative studies of the\nhistories of oppression of other \u201cnations\u201d within\nnation-states dominated by an antagonistic national (i.e., racial)\ngroup (Delany 1852; 2004). Based on his analysis, Delany was convinced\nthat people of color could not enjoy lives as full citizens with full\nrespect and rights in the United States. Hence, he reasoned, people of\ncolor should leave the country for South America\u2014though later he\nwould advocate emigrating to Africa\u2014to establish their own\nindependent nation-state. (However, when the Civil War erupted, Delany\nwas persuaded by Frederick Douglass, his former colleague in\npublishing The North Star newspaper, to join other Black men\nin forming a regiment to aid the Union forces in defeating the\nConfederate Army and the South\u2019s agenda for the continuation of\nthe enslavement and oppression of Black people.)\n\n\nIt is important to note, however, that emigrationists were often\nmotivated not only by desires to escape the various modes and\nintensities of disrespect for their racial being and humanity by\nrelocating to Africa, in particular, but also in order to fulfill\naspirations to engage in missionary work among native peoples on that\ncontinent in order to \u201craise\u201d them from\n\u201csavagery\u201d to \u201ccivilization\u201d through education\nand Christianization. Edward Blyden, for example, spent a large portion\nof his life engaged in educational and missionary work in Liberia.\nJames T. Holly, who advocated emigration to, and himself subsequently\nsettled in, Haiti and authored a lengthy work devoted to\n\u201cdefending the inherent capabilities of the Negro race, for\nself-government and civilized progress\u201d (A Vindication of the\nCapacity of the Negro Race for Self-Government and Civilized\nProgress, 1857), was a clergyman. So, too, was the indomitable\nQueen\u2019s College of Cambridge University-educated Alexander\nCrummell (1819\u20131898), who devoted twenty years of his life to\neducational and missionary work in Liberia and Sierra Leone followed by\nyears of pastoral work in the United States. Crummell (\u201cThe\nRelations and Duties of Free Colored Men in America to Africa,\u201d\n1860; \u201cThe Race Problem in America,\u201d 1888) was a formidable\nand very articulate thinker, author, speechmaker, and organizer with\ncommanding presence. He was a principal founder of the American Negro\nAcademy (1897\u20131924), a gathering of astute minds and engaged Negro men\ndevoted to analyzing the conditions of life of Negroes in the United\nStates, to determining how best to protect them from the continuing\nravages of centuries of enslavement, and to determining how best to\ndevelop the race to achieve political and social equality and economic\njustice.\n\n\nWorthy of critical exploration in the case of these figures: the\nextent to which, and on what terms, each of them embraced (assimilated)\nprevailing European and Euro-American conceptions of\ncivilization and the processes and conditions, states of\ncharacter in particular, by which a person or people could be said to\nbe \u201ccivilized.\u201d It is apparent in their writings and the\nlogic of their missionary work, in other lands as well as within the\nUnited States, that neither figure accepted the long-prevailing\narguments that the Negro race was inherently and ineradicably\ninferior. To the contrary, close scrutiny of their articulations will\nreveal that each was convinced that the civilizational inferiority of\ncontinental Africans, and of the ignorant, brutally constrained Negroes\nof deficient character in the United States, was due to conditions of\ndeprivation fostered by the enslavement and racism perpetrated by White\npeople. At the core of the missionary work of these men, and of many of\ntheir female and male contemporaries and successors, including persons\nwho worked at \u201cuplifting\u201d enslaved and freedpersons in the\nUnited States, was a principled and dedicated commitment to\nwell-reasoned and forcefully articulated belief in the God-given\nhumanity and inherent worth of persons of the Negro race, and fervent\nand equally dedicated belief in the ameliorative and progressive\nbenefits of education and racial independence. And each of these\nseminal figures took himself or herself as a living example of the\nactualization of the potentiality for substantial, qualitative\ndevelopment and advancement by Negroes, contrary to the\ncharacterizations of the race by those who rationalized and otherwise\nsought to justify enslavement and constrictions of the range of\npossibilities for Negro development. The articulations of a significant\nnumber of such persons have been preserved in the vast body of writings\ncontending with enslavement, with aspirations and quests for freedom\nand justice, with what a constitutionally democratic and multiracial\nUnited States of America ought to be in order to include\nColoured people as full citizens and fully respected human beings.\nTheirs are, indeed, philosophizings born of struggles.\n",
