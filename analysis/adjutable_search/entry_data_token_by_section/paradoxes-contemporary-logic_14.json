However,\nself-referential constructions attained an adequate degree of\nmathematical rigor and became genuine mathematical tools only when non\ntrivial number-theoretic techniques were put to work (see the entry\n recursive functions),\n for instance in the analysis of syntactical substitution and in\nproviding arithmetical models of formal provability (the crucial role\nof substitution for producing contradictions was already noticed by\nRussell, although he did not publish this; see Pelham and Urquhart\n1994). Conceptually, it is clear from G\u00f6delian constructions that\nself-reference by itself is innocuous if it is understood in the\nindirect sense: one can have formulas \\(\\phi(x)\\), expressing\nproperties of their own \u201cname\u201d \\(\\ulcorner \\phi\n\\urcorner\\), but no dangerous circularity arises.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s construction was soon given a general form, as a\ngeneral diagonalization lemma, which refers to arbitrary definable\nproperties. This is to be found in Carnap 1934b, p. 91, Carnap 1934a,\np. 270, and in Rosser 1939, p. 57, Lemma 1:\n\n\nFor every formula \\(\\psi(v)\\) with only \\(v\\) free, there exists a\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) such that \n\n\\[ \\phi \\leftrightarrow \\psi(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner) \\]\n\n\nis provable (see also the entry on\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems).\n\n\nAs a matter of fact the lemma has become the standard tool for\nproducing self-referential statements and for transforming the\nsemantical paradoxes into indefinability and (formal) undecidability\nresults (see the entry on\n self-reference).\n The algebra underlying the G\u00f6delian constructions will be\ngrasped only much later during the 1970\u2019s. It is also important\nto stress that a few years later (1938) an analog of the\ndiagonalization lemma (the so-called second recursion theorem) was\ndiscovered by Kleene and was soon to become a basic tool in the\nfoundations of recursion theory and computability theory.\n",
