    "main_text": "Future Contingents || A Fatalist Argument\n6.1 A Fatalist Argument\n\nWhat philosophers call the problem of future contingents goes\ntogether naturally with the related and more well-known problem of\nfree will and determinism. In the Middle Ages, as now, we really\nfind a cluster of several related problems radiating from a single\ncommon conundrum or paradox. One important difference is that the\nmediaeval problem has some theological branches that today receive\nless philosophical attention. For example, few modern philosophers\nseriously consider the seeming inconsistency between veridical\nprophecy and the contingency of the future, or whether angels of high\nrank can reveal future contingents to inferior angels, but these were\nimportant issues with their own test cases in the Middle Ages.\nMoreover, the problem was far more stark, severe, and difficult for\nmediaeval Christian thinkers than for modern secular philosophers,\nsince it was doctrinally unacceptable to solve the problem by ejecting\nsome element of the paradox \u2013 all elements of the\nparadox were important pieces of Christian doctrine. One felicitous\nconsequence of this struggle is that some very original and deep\nphilosophy was created and employed in an attempt to find a stable\nsolution. I will briefly present the conundrum at the heart of the\nmatter, and then examine Chatton\u2019s own radical and relatively\noriginal solution to the\n problem.[8]\n\nConsider the following grouping of ideas, objects, and events in our\nuniverse (Chatton\u2019s usual Latin terms for certain cognates are\ndistinguished in parentheses):\n\n\n\nRIGID\nOPEN \n\n1.\nnecessity\n8.\ncontingency (f. sg. contingentia, \u2013ae)\n\n\n2.\nuniversal causality\n9.\nhuman free will \n\n3.\nuniversal bivalence (=every proposition is determinately either\ntrue or false)\n10.\ncontingent things (n. pl.\ncontingentia,-um) \n\n4.\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge\n11.\nplanning and working for the future \n\n5.\nveridical prophecy\n12.\nfuture contingent propositions (propositiones contingentes\nde futuro) \n\n6.\npredestination\n13.\nthe undetermined future \n\n7.\nprovidence\n14.\nmerit for good acts, freely done  \n\n\nNo kind of strict paring between list entries across from each other\non the right and left is intended here. Rather, we should notice three\nthings. (1) All of the putative objects and phenomena on the left-hand\nunder the heading RIGID are elements of the universe that are firm and\nunchanging, and their existence seems to entail a kind of immutability\nof reality; the world cannot be otherwise. (2) Those putative objects\nunder OPEN, by contrast, seem indeterminate and loose, and their\nexistence demands recognition of alternatives; the world can be\notherwise. (3) It is common and quite attractive to believe in the\nexistence of many of the elements on the left and on the right\nsimultaneously, but it seems clear that the implications of that\nbelief are often contradictory, entailing that one and the same piece\nof reality both can be otherwise and cannot be otherwise in the same\nway at the same time. In short, certain mixtures of these elements,\nright and left, are nearly irresistible parts of our total outlook on\nthe universe, but unfortunately they seem to yield contradictions. Not\nevery pairing of items yields a paradox, e.g., 1 and 8 do not. There\ncan be both necessity and contingency in the world. The reader is\ninvited to consider, however, just how many left-right pairings from\nthese lists do seem both attractive and impossible.\n\nThere are as many possible solutions to these paradoxes as may be\nimagined, but there are really only three ways out; either: (1) accept\nthe rigid element of reality at the expense of the open element, or\n(2) accept the open element at the expense of the rigid element, or\n(3) show that the contradiction between the two is only a seeming\ncontradiction. Most mediaeval philosophers took this third approach in\ntheir solutions.\n\nBy the time Chatton was writing, it was quite common to present a\nbasic fatalist or necessitarian argument to show that God\u2019s\nforeknowledge, which seems deeply connected to his providence, is not\nconsistent with future contingent things and events. Here is\nChatton\u2019s version of this standard fatalist argument:\n\nHerein lies the difficulty of this question \u2013 if it were\nconsistent with the contingency of future events that God knows future\ncontingents, then this consequence would follow: \u2018God knew that\nthe Antichrist will come; therefore the Antichrist will come\u2019.\nThe antecedent of this consequence is necessary, as is the consequence\nitself, hence the consequent is necessary. But the [necessary]\nconsequent \u2018the Antichrist will come\u2019 is not consistent\nwith the contingency [of the future event the Antichrist\ncomes]. Therefore [God\u2019s knowledge is not consistent with\nthe contingency of the future]. (Reportatio I, 10\u201348,\nd. 38, paragraph 2, p. 347)\n\n\nTwo things to note. (1) The coming of the Antichrist is a\nstandard example of a future event that is anticipated but which seems\ncontingent; however, there is no special importance attached to the\ncontent of the example; equally popular was the less dramatic example\n\u2018Socrates will sit\u2019. (2) A consequence is what we\ncall a consecution today (something of the form \u2018\\(p\\)\ntherefore \\(q\\)\u2019), but in this case we can, without distortion,\nmodel the reasoning by treating it as a conditional. The fatalist\nargues that (IF God knew the Antichrist will come THEN the Antichrist\nwill come) is necessary, and moreover, the antecedent, \u2018God\nknows the Antichrist will come\u2019, is also necessary, since\nGod\u2019s knowledge is certain and firm. But if (IF \\(p\\) THEN\n\\(q)\\) is necessary, and furthermore the antecedent \\(p\\) is\nnecessary, it follows by uncontroversial logical principles that the\nconsequent \\(q\\) is necessary; hence we can conclude that the coming\nof the Antichrist is necessary, which violates our assumption that the\nfuture is open. Chatton summarizes the fatalist argument this way:\n\nThis whole thing can also be made more compact with the formula:\n\u2018God knew that \\(a\\) will be; therefore \\(a\\) will necessarily\nbe\u2019. (Reportatio I, 10\u201348, d. 38, paragraph 2, p.\n347)\n\n\nThis is the argument to be defeated. After brief consideration of some\nother views, including Peter Auriol\u2019s, which seems to have\ninfluenced him in certain respects, Chatton draws together the threads\nof his discussion into a solution that is quite original and radical,\nbut which he supports only hesitantly, not apparently out of\nintellectual reservations but out of fear of falling into heresy.\nAlthough his hesitation makes it difficult to pin him down, a\nreasonably secure reconstruction of his ideas seems possible. His\nsolution has two parts: (1) He offers a counter-argument to the\nfatalist\u2019s reasoning, and (2) he clarifies the way God\nknows future contingents.\n",
