    "main_text": "Contemporary Accounts of Personal Identity || Assessing Theories of Personal Identity in Light of Fission\n2.6 Assessing Theories of Personal Identity in Light of Fission \nFission is a challenge to any theory of personal identity that\npurports to preserve a tight relation between identity and our\npractical concerns. The Psychological Criterion will be a clear\ncasualty, for instance.  As for the Biological Criterion, it seems\nmost plausible, in light of fission, to adopt an extreme version of\nthe IDM stance, maintaining (as does Olson 1997, as noted earlier)\nthat our numerical identity just doesn't ground our practical concerns\nat all (which are instead a function of a \u201csame person\nrelation\u201d that need not adhere to the demands of a strict\nnumerical identity relation).\nWhat, though, about the Anthropological View?  Schechtman offers an\ninteresting take on fission: Such a procedure hasn't yet occurred, so\nwithout filling in the social conditions and practices we can't state\nin advance what the identity of the survivors would be.  If fission\nhappened all the time, all of those future humans would likely be very\ndifferent sorts of creatures from us, as they would be living a\ndifferent form of life, and so the identity conditions for individuals\nlike us simply wouldn't apply to them.  If it happened only\nonce or very rarely, the survivors would be sufficiently like us (as\nwe could still engage with them interpersonally, and our interactions\nwith them could still make sense from within our current form of life)\nthat they would be one of us, but they couldn't be identical to the\noriginal person.  This is because there would be such a huge range of\ndifferences in how they would be treated \u2013 by the spouse, children,\nfriends, bank, and employer of the pre-fission person \u2013 that each\nperson's relation to the pre-fission person would now just be too\ndifferent to count as identity (Schechtman 2014, 159\u2013166).  The\nAnthropological View thus seems as if it can deal with fission while\nnevertheless preserving a tight relation between identity and\npractical concerns.\nIt seems difficult to arbitrate between the IDM and the\nAnthropological View, and one reason is that they seem to be taking\ndifferent methodological approaches to identifying the identity\nconditions for different kinds of entities.  Regarding the latter,\nParfit asks the first-person question, \u201cWhat matters\nto me in fission?\u201d and this presupposes that we are\ntalking about the type of creatures (pre- and post-fission) that are\nindividuals like us in terms of our full-fledged forensic (Lockean\npersonhood) capacities.  Schechtman, on the other hand, asks the\nthird-person question, about how such fission products would be\ntreated, which allows for their being creatures who are indeed\ndifferent from us.  Furthermore, Schechtman is interested in\nidentifying (from the start) the unified locus of our practical\nconcerns and then subsequently figuring out that thing's\nidentity conditions, whereas Parfit is interested in what antecedent\ntheories of personal identity would imply for our practical\nconcerns in light of fission.  This latter difference in methodology\nwill be discussed in a later section.  The former difference in the\nobject of our practical concerns, however, may be irreconcilable.\nIndeed, from my perspective in fission, once I'm a Lockean\nperson, it may seem that nothing internal to that perspective will be\nlost (holding instead twice over).  But I can also understand how\ndifferently the survivors might well be treated in a number of\nrespects by others.  It may thus be unclear which perspective we ought\nto privilege here.\n",
