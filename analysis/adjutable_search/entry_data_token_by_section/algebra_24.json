    "main_text": "Free algebras || Free logical structures\n6.4 Free logical structures\n\nBoolean algebras are traditionally defined axiomatically as\ncomplemented distributive lattices, which has the benefit of showing\nthat they form a variety, and furthermore a finitely axiomatizable\none. However Boolean algebras are so fundamental in their own right\nthat, rather than go to the trouble of defining lattice, distributive,\nand complemented just for this purpose, it is easier as well as more\ninsightful to obtain them from the initial Boolean algebra. It\nsuffices to define this as the two-element set \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\), the\nconstants (zeroary operations) 0 and 1, and the \\(2^{2^2} = 16\\)\nbinary operations. A Boolean algebra is then any algebra with those 16\noperations and two constants satisfying the equations satisfied by the\ninitial Boolean algebra.\n\nAn almost-definitive property of the class of Boolean algebras is that\ntheir polynomials in the initial Boolean algebra are all the\noperations on that algebra. The catch is that the inconsistent class\nconsisting of only the one-element or inconsistent algebra also has\nthis property. This class is easily ruled out however by adding that\nBoolean algebra is consistent. But just barely\u2014adding any new\nequation to Boolean algebra (without introducing new operations)\naxiomatizes the inconsistent algebra.\n\nSheffer has shown that the constants and the 16 operations can be\ngenerated as polynomials in just one constant, which can be 0 or 1,\nand one binary operation, which can be NAND, \\(\\neg(x\\wedge y)\\), or\nNOR, \\(\\neg(x\\vee y)\\). Any such sufficient set is called a\nbasis. Along the same lines Stone has shown that conjunction,\nexclusive-or, and the constant 1 form a basis. The significance of\nStone\u2019s basis over Sheffer\u2019s is that Boolean algebras\norganized with those operations satisfy all the axioms for a\ncommutative ring with identity with conjunction as multiplication and\nexclusive-or as addition, as well as the law \\(x^2 = 1\\). Any ring\nsatisfying this last condition is called a Boolean ring.\nBoolean rings are equivalent to Boolean algebras in the sense that\nthey have the same polynomials.\n\nAn atom of a Boolean algebra is an element \\(x\\) such that for all\n\\(y, x\\wedge y\\) is either \\(x\\) or 0. An atomless Boolean algebra is\none with no atoms.\n\nThere is exactly one Boolean algebra of cardinality every finite power\nof 2, and it is isomorphic to the Boolean algebra of a power set\n\\(2^X\\) of that cardinality under the set operations of union,\nintersection, and complement relative to \\(X\\). Hence all finite\nBoolean algebras have cardinality a power of 2. This situation changes\nwith infinite Boolean algebras; in particular countable Boolean\nalgebras exist. One such is the free Boolean algebra on countably many\ngenerators, which is the only countable atomless Boolean algebra. The\nfinite and cofinite (complement of a finite set) subsets of the set\n\\(N\\) of natural numbers form a subalgebra of the powerset Boolean\nalgebra \\(2^N\\) not isomorphic to the free Boolean algebra, but it has\natoms, namely the singleton sets.\n\nThe free Boolean algebra \\(F(n)\\) on \\(n\\) generators consists of all\n\\(2^2 n\\) \\(n\\)-ary operations on the two-element Boolean algebra.\nBoolean algebras therefore form a locally finite variety.\n\nThe equational theory of distributive lattices is obtained from that\nof Boolean algebras by selecting as its operations just the monotone\nbinary operations on the two-element algebra, omitting the constants.\nThese are the operations with the property that if either argument is\nchanged from 0 to 1, the result does not change from 1 to 0. A\ndistributive lattice is any model of those Boolean equations between\nterms built solely with monotone binary operations. Hence every\nBoolean algebra is a distributive lattice.\n\nDistributive lattices can be arbitrarily \u201cthin.\u201d At the\nextreme, any chain (linear or total order, \\(e.g\\). the reals\nstandardly ordered) under the usual operations of max and min forms a\ndistributive lattice. Since we have omitted the constants this\nincludes the empty lattice, which we have not excluded here as an\nalgebra. (Some authors disallow the empty set as an algebra but this\nproscription spoils many good theorems without gaining any useful\nones.) Hence there exist distributive lattices of every possible\ncardinality.\n\nEvery finite-dimensional vector space is free, being generated by any\nchoice of basis. This extends to infinite-dimensional vector spaces\nprovided we accept the Axiom of Choice. Vector spaces over a finite\nfield therefore form a locally finite variety when scalar\nmultiplication is organized as one unary operation for each field\nelement.\n",
