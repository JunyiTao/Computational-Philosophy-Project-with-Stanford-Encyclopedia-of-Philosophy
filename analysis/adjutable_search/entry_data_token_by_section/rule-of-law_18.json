    "main_text": "Controversies about Application || Rules and Standards\n8.2 Rules and Standards\n\nA similar question arises with regard to the use of norms that have\nthe character of standards rather than rules. (A rule is like a\nnumerical speed limit, whereas a standard is like a norm that requires\npeople to drive at a \u201creasonable\u201d speed.) Legal systems\nuse both types of norm (Sunstein 1994); they use standards for cases\nwhere the appropriate decision may vary with ambient circumstances and\nit seems better to trust the judgment of those who face a particular\nsituation, rather than laying it down in advance. There is an element\nof respect for individuals\u2019 powers of discernment conveyed in\nthe use of a standard. At the same time standards allow for less\ncertainty in the law, especially when it is difficult for the person\nattempting to comply with the norm to predict how his judgment will be\nviewed by an official or by a court. Hayek suggests that \n\n\n[o]ne could write a history of the decline of the Rule of Law \u2026\nin terms of the progressive introduction of these vague formulas into\nlegislation and jurisdiction. (1972 [1944]: 78) \n\n\nWhether he is right depends partly on how far we take the Rule of Law\nto be wedded to predictability: is predictability the be-all and\nend-all, or does the Rule of Law also promise a kind of legal system\nthat frames and facilitates reason and thoughtfulness in human\naffairs?\n",
