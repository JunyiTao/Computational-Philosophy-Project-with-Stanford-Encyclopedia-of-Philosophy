Orders of Presentation and Methods of Discovery\n\n\nFor Zabarella method also serves to differentiate the sciences from\nthe arts. The term can be understood in two ways, either in a wide\nsense as a method of presenting existing knowledge, which he prefers\nto call an order (ordo) of presentation, or in a narrow sense\nas a method of discovering knowledge, for which he reserves method\n(methodus) in its proper understanding. According to\nZabarella, ordo is an instrumental habitus through\nwhich we are prepared so to dispose the parts of each discipline so\nthat the discipline may be taught as well and easily as possible.\n\n\nAs regards these methods of presentation, Zabarella denies Galen\u2019s\nview that these are four in number. Zabarella himself recognizes only\ntwo orders, the compositive and the resolutive. The order starts with\nwhat is either necessary or useful for teaching and learning. In the\ncontemplative (or theoretical) sciences, which aim at perfect\nknowledge, order of presentation follows the so-called way of\ncomposition (compositio) from general principles to\nparticular beings; in moral philosophy and in the arts, which aim at\naction or production, order follows the so-called way of resolution\n(resolutio) from the desired end to its first principles.\n\n\nFor Zabarella the methods in the strict sense of the word are\nintellectual instruments proceeding from the known to produce\nknowledge of the unknown. Such methods have argumentative force and\nthey deal with specific problems of the disciplines instead of\narranging the contents of a whole discipline, as do the orders of\npresentation. As with orders, Zabarella denied the possibility of more\nthan two methods.  He shows that other procedures, like the\ncomposition and division used in the hunt of definitions as well as\nthe so-called dialectical syllogisms are not genuinely productive of\nknowledge and therefore not methods in the proper sense of the\nterm.\n\n\nTherefore he recognized only two methods, which he labeled\ndemonstrative and resolutive. Demonstrative method (or composition)\nproceeds from cause to effect and involves demonstration \u201cof the\nreasoned fact\u201d or \u201cmost powerful\u201d demonstration,\nbest exemplified in the mathematical sciences. Resolutive method (or\nresolution) proceeds from effect to cause and, despite its name, also\ninvolves demonstration, but of an inferior kind, that is called\ndemonstration \u201cof the fact\u201d or \u201cfrom a sign\u201d.\nRelated to this alter type of demonstration is the process of\ninduction (inductio), which is helpful for discovering\nprinciples that are known naturally but are not immediately\nevident. Zabarella believes that, by the force of induction, human\nintellect is capable of distinguishing the universal, which is hidden\nin particulars.  Induction, or resolutive method makes up the first\nphase in the regressus-method, which was, in his opinion, the\nonly proper method for natural philosophy.\n\n\nIt is this very distinction between the method of inquiry and the\norder of teaching that led Zabarella to a bitter controversy with his\nPaduan college Francesco Piccolomini (1523\u20131607). They both agreed\nthat ethical inquiry must proceed by deduction from an understanding\nof the end. In Zabarella\u2019s view all the disciplines whose end is\naction should be explained in this same way. But Piccolomini could\nnot bring himself to admit that the order of teaching, in ethics as well\nas in in other practical disciplines, should follow this order of\napprehension.  Thus the fundamental question embedded in this dispute\nis the following: Is the order of teaching a particular discipline\nnecessary or contingent? Zabarella argued for the former: both in\ndiscovery and in teaching, one should follow the synthetic order in\nthe sciences and the analytic order in the arts. By making a sharp\ndistinction between the method of discovery and the order of teaching,\nPiccolomini instead embraced a contingent view of pedagogical\nmethod. Wishing to teach others, Piccolomini saw his duty as that of\nstarting out from first principles (a primis principiis). In\nsuch a case it is better to begin with the simpler matters and\nprogress toward the end or goal.  (Lines 2002, pp. 254\u2013263)\n\n\nThrough their rival claims about ordo doctrinae Zabarella and\nPiccolomini revealed as well very different perceptions of academic\nand civil order, and very different ways of conceiving and pursuing\nthe office of philosopher within that order. Zabarella wholeheartedly\nendorsed the purely contemplative nature of philosophy and the\nsuperiority of the contemplative life (Mikkeli 1992, pp. 25\u201335). He\nalso was frequently dismissive in his treatment of the disciplines he\nregarded as active or operative, for example law, medicine, ethics,\npolitics and mechanics. Piccolomini\u2019s position was sharply\nopposed. For him, philosophy is, indeed, crucial for the spiritual\nperfection of man. However, in the form of scientia civilis\nit is also the key to the this-wordly perfection that can be attained\nin the just administration of the Venetian republic (Jardine\n1997).\n",
