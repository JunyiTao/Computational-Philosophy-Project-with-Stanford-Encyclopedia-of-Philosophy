    "main_text": "Conclusions, Open Issues, and Future Directions || The Role of Causation\n7.1 The Role of Causation\n\nOne issue concerns the role of causal information in scientific\nexplanation. All of the traditional models considered above attempt to\ncapture causal explanations, although some attempt to capture\nnon-causal explanations as well. It is a natural thought (endorsed by\nmany) that many of the difficulties faced by the models described\nabove derive at least in part from their reliance on inadequate\ntreatments of causation.[15]\n The problems of explanatory asymmetries and explanatory irrelevance\ndescribed in\n Section 2.5\n seem to show that the holding of a law between C and E\nis not sufficient for C to cause E; hence not a\nsufficient condition for C to figure in an explanation of\nE. If the argument of\n section 3.3\n is correct, a fundamental problem with the SR model is that\nstatistical relevance information is insufficient to fully capture\ncausal information in the sense that different causal structures can\nbe consistent with the same information about statistical relevance\nrelationships. Similarly, the CM model faces the difficulty\nthat information about causal processes and interactions is also\ninsufficient to fully capture causal relevance relations and that\nthere is a range of cases in which causal relationships hold between\nC and E (and hence in which C figures in an\nexplanation of E) although there is no connecting causal\nprocess between C and E. Finally, a fundamental problem\nwith unificationist models is that the content of our causal judgments\ndoes not seem to fall out of our efforts at unification, at least when\nunification is understood along the lines advocated by Kitcher. For\nexample, as discussed above, considerations having to do with\nunification do not by themselves explain why it is appropriate to\nexplain effects in terms of their causes rather than vice-versa.\n\nThese observations suggest that insofar as we are interested in causal\nforms of scientific explanation progress may require more attention to\nthe notion of causation and a more thorough-going integration of\ndiscussions of explanation with the burgeoning literature on\ncausation, both within and outside of\n philosophy.[16]\n A number of steps in this direction have been taken. (cf. Woodward\n2003).\n\nDoes this mean that a focus on causation should entirely replace the\nproject of developing models of explanation or that philosophers\nshould stop talking about explanation and instead talk just about\ncausation? Despite the apparent centrality of causation to many\nexplanations, it is arguable that completely subsuming the latter into\nthe former loses connections with some important issues. For one\nthing, causal claims themselves seem to vary greatly in the extent to\nwhich they are explanatorily deep or illuminating. Causal claims found\nin Newtonian mechanics seem deeper or more satisfying from the point\nof view of explanation than causal claims of \u201cthe rock broke the\nwindow\u201d variety. It is usually supposed that such differences\nare connected to other features\u2014for example to how general,\nstable, coherent with background knowledge a causal claim is. However,\nnotions like \u201cgenerality\u201d are vague and not all forms of\ngenerality seem to be connected to explanatory goodness. So even if\none focuses only on causal explanation, there remains the important\nproject of trying to understand better what sorts of distinctions\namong causal claims matter for goodness in explanation. To the extent\nthis is so, the kinds of concerns that have animated traditional\ntreatments of explanation don\u2019t seem to be entirely subsumable\ninto standard accounts of causation, which have tended to focus\nlargely on the project of distinguishing causal from non-causal\nrelationships rather than on the features that make causal\nrelationships \u201cgood\u201d for purposes of explanation.\n\nAnother important question has to do with whether there are forms of\nwhy-explanation that are non-causal. If so, how important are these\nare in science and what is their structure? Hempel seems to have\nthought of causal explanations simply as those DN explanations that\nappeal to causal laws which he regarded as a proper subset of all\nlaws. Thus on his view, causal and non-causal explanations share a\ncommon structure. Kitcher\u2019s unificationist model was also\nintended to apply to both causal and non-causal explanations such as\nunifying argument patterns in linguistics. More recently, there has\nbeen a great upsurge of interest in whether there are non-causal forms\nof explanation, with some claiming they are ubiquitous in science\n(e.g., Lange 2017, Reutlinger & Saatsi 2018). If there are such explanations, this\nraises the issue of what distinguishes them from causal explanations\nand whether there is some overarching theory that subsumes both causal\nand non-causal explanations. \n",
