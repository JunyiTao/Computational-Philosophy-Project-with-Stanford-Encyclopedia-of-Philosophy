    "main_text": "The Problems of Personal Identity\n1. The Problems of Personal Identity\n\nThere is no single problem of personal identity, but rather a wide\nrange of questions that are at best loosely connected and not always\ndistinguished. Here are the most familiar:\n\nCharacterization. Outside of philosophy, the term\n\u2018personal identity\u2019 commonly refers to properties to which\nwe feel a special sense of attachment or ownership. My personal\nidentity in this sense consists of those properties I take to\n\u201cdefine me as a person\u201d or \u201cmake me the person I\nam\u201d. (The precise meaning of these phrases is hard to pin down.)\nTo have an \u201cidentity crisis\u201d is to become unsure of what\nmy most characteristic properties are\u2014of what sort of person I\nam in some deep and fundamental sense. This individual personal\nidentity contrasts with my gender, ethnic, and national identity,\nwhich consist roughly of the sex, ethnic group, or nation I take\nmyself to belong to and the importance I attach to this.\n\nSomeone\u2019s personal identity in this sense is contingent and\ntemporary: the way I define myself as a person might have been\ndifferent, and can vary from one time to another. It is a subset,\nusually a small one, of the properties someone has: it could happen\nthat being a philosopher and a parent belong to my identity but not\nbeing a man or a cyclist, while someone else has the same four\nproperties but feels differently towards them, so that being a man and\na cyclist belong to his identity but not being a philosopher or a\nparent. Someone may not even need to have the properties\nbelonging to her identity: if I become convinced that I am Napoleon,\nbeing an emperor could be one of the properties central to the way I\ndefine myself and thus part of my identity, even though the belief is\nfalse.\n\nWhat determines someone\u2019s personal identity in this sense is\nsometimes called the characterization question (Schechtman\n1996: 1). It asks, in the expectation of a deep and revealing\npsychological answer, Who am I? (Glover 1988: part 2 and Ludwig 1997\nare useful discussions.)\n\nPersonhood. What is it to be a person, as opposed to\na nonperson? What have we people got that nonpeople haven\u2019t got?\nThe question often arises in connection with specific cases: we may\nask, for example, at what point in our development from a fertilized\negg there comes to be a person, or what it would take for a chimpanzee\nor a Martian or a computer to be a person, if they could ever be. An\nideal account of personhood would be a definition of the word\n\u2018person\u2019, filling the blanks in the formula\n\u2018Necessarily, x is a person at time t if and\nonly if \u2026 x \u2026 t \u2026\u2019.\n\nThe most common answer is that to be a person is to have certain\nspecial mental properties. Locke, for instance, said that a person is\n\u201ca thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection,\nand can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in\ndifferent times and places\u201d (1975: 335; Baker 2000: ch. 3 is a\ndetailed account of this sort). Others propose a less direct\nconnection between personhood and these special mental properties: for\nexample that to be a person is be capable of acquiring them (Chisholm\n1976: 136f.), or to belong to a kind whose members typically have them\nwhen healthy and mature (Wiggins 1980: ch. 6). (A very different\nanswer is mentioned in section 6.)\n\nPersistence. What does it take for a person to\npersist from one time to another\u2014to continue existing rather\nthan cease to exist? What sorts of things is it possible, in the\nbroadest sense of the word \u2018possible\u2019, for you to survive,\nand what sort of event would necessarily bring your existence to an\nend? What determines which past or future being is you? Suppose you\npoint to a child in an old class photograph and say,\n\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d What makes you that one rather than one\nof the others? What is it about the way she relates then to you as you\nare now that makes her you? For that matter, what makes it the case\nthat anyone at all existing back then is you? This is sometimes called\nthe question of personal identity over time, as it has to do\nwith whether the earlier and the later being are one thing or\ntwo\u2014that is, whether they are numerically identical. An answer\nto it is an account of our persistence conditions.\n\nHistorically this question often arises from the thought that we might\ncontinue existing after we die (as in Plato\u2019s Phaedo).\nWhether this could happen depends on whether biological death\nnecessarily brings our existence to an end. Imagine that after your\ndeath there really will be someone, in this world or the next, who\nresembles you in certain ways. How would she have to relate to you as\nyou are now in order to be you, rather than someone else?\nWhat would the Higher Powers have to do to keep you in existence after\nyour death? Or is it even possible? The answer to these questions\ndepends on the answer to the persistence question.\n\nEvidence. How do we find out who is who? What\nevidence bears on the question of whether the person here now is the\none who was here yesterday? One source of evidence is first-person\nmemory: if you remember doing some particular action (or seem to), and\nsomeone really did do it, this supports the claim that that person is\nyou. Another source is physical resemblance: if the person who did it\nlooks just like you\u2014or better, if she is in some way physically\nor spatio-temporally continuous with you\u2014that too supports her\nbeing you. Which of these sources is more fundamental? Does\nfirst-person memory count as evidence all by itself, or only insofar\nas we can check it against physical facts? What should we do when\nthese considerations support opposing verdicts?\n\nSuppose Charlie\u2019s memories are erased and replaced with accurate\nmemories (or apparent memories) of the life of someone long\ndead\u2014Guy Fawkes, say (Williams 1956\u20137). Ought we to\nconclude on these grounds that the resulting person is not actually\nCharlie, but Guy Fawkes brought back to life? Or should we instead\ninfer on the basis of physical continuity that he\u2019s just Charlie\nwith different memories? What principle would answer this\nquestion?\n\nThe evidence question dominated the anglophone literature on personal\nidentity from the 1950s to the 1970s (Shoemaker 1963, 1970 and\nPenelhum 1967 are good examples). It\u2019s important to distinguish\nit from the persistence question. What it takes for you to persist\nthrough time is one thing; how we ought to evaluate the relevant\nevidence is another. If the criminal had fingerprints just like yours,\nthe courts may rightly conclude that he is you, but having your\nfingerprints is not what it is for a past or future being to\nbe you: it\u2019s neither necessary (you could survive without any\nfingers at all) nor sufficient (someone else could have fingerprints\njust like yours).\n\nPopulation. If the persistence question is about\nwhich of the characters introduced at the beginning of a story have\nsurvived till the end of it, we may also ask how many are on the stage\nat any one time. What determines how many of us there are right now?\nIf there are eight billion people on the earth at present, what\nfacts\u2014biological, psychological, or what have you\u2014make\nthat the right number?\n\nYou may think the number of people at any given time (or at least the\nnumber of human people) is simply the number of human\norganisms there are then. But this is disputed. Some say that cutting\nthe main connections between the cerebral hemispheres results in\nradical disunity of consciousness so that two people share a single\norganism (Nagel 1971; for skeptical views see Wilkes 1988: ch. 5 and\nvan Inwagen 1990: 188\u2013212). Others say that a human being with\nmultiple personality could literally be the home of two or more\nthinking beings (Wilkes 1988: 127f., Rovane 1998: 169ff.; see also\nOlson 2003, Snowdon 2014: ch. 7). Still others argue that two people\ncan share an organism in cases of conjoined twinning (Campbell and\nMcMahan 2016; see also Olson 2014).\n\nThe population question is sometimes called the problem of\n\u201csynchronic identity\u201d, as opposed to the \u201cdiachronic\nidentity\u201d of the persistence question; but these terms need\ncareful handling. They are apt to give the mistaken impression that\nidentity comes in two kinds, synchronic and diachronic. The truth is\nsimply that there are two kinds of situations where we can ask how\nmany people (or other things) there are: those involving just one\nmoment and those involving several. To make matters worse, the term\n\u2018synchronic identity\u2019 is sometimes used to express the\npersonhood question.\n\nPersonal ontology. What are we? What properties of\nmetaphysical importance do we human people have, in addition to the\nmental properties that make us people? What, for instance, are we made\nof? Are we composed entirely of matter, as stones are, or are we\npartly or wholly immaterial? Where do our spatial boundaries lie, if\nwe are spatially extended at all? Do we extend all the way out to our\nskin? If so, what fixes those boundaries? Do we have temporal as well\nas spatial parts? Are we substances\u2014metaphysically independent\nbeings\u2014or is each of us a state or an activity of something\nelse?\n\nHere are some of the main proposed accounts of what we are (Olson\n2007):\n\nWe are biological organisms (\u201canimalism\u201d: van Inwagen\n1990, Olson 1997, 2003a).\nWe are material things \u201cconstituted by\u201d organisms: a\nperson is made of the same matter as a certain animal, but they are\ndifferent things because what it takes for them to persist is\ndifferent (Baker 2000, Johnston 2007, Shoemaker 2011).\nWe are temporal parts of animals: each of us stands to an organism\nas your childhood stands to your life as a whole (Lewis 1976).\nWe are spatial parts of animals: something like brains, perhaps\n(Campbell and McMahan 2016, Parfit 2012), or temporal parts of brains\n(Hudson 2001, 2007).\nWe are partless immaterial substances\u2014souls\u2014as Plato,\nDescartes, and Leibniz thought (Unger 2006: ch. 7), or compound things\nmade up of an immaterial soul and a biological organism (Swinburne\n1984: 21).\nWe are collections of mental states or events: \u201cbundles of\nperceptions\u201d, as Hume said (1978 [1739]: 252; see also Quinton\n1962, Campbell 2006).\nThere is nothing that we are: we don\u2019t really exist at all\n(Russell 1985: 50, Unger 1979, Sider 2013).\n\n\nThere is no consensus or even a dominant view on this question.\n\nWhat matters in survival. What is the practical\nimportance of facts about our persistence? Why does it\nmatter? If you had to choose between continuing to exist or\nbeing annihilated and replaced by someone else exactly like you, what\nreason would you have to prefer one over the other? And what reason do\nyou have to care about what will happen to you, as opposed to what\nwill happen to other people? Or is there any such reason? Imagine that\nsurgeons are going to put your brain into my head and that neither of\nus has any choice about this. The resulting person will be in terrible\npain after the operation unless one of us pays a large sum in advance.\nIf we were both entirely selfish, which of us would have a reason to\npay? Will the resulting person\u2014who will think he is you\u2014be\nresponsible for your actions or for mine? (Or both, or neither?) These\nquestions are summarized in the phrase what matters in\nsurvival.\n\nThe answer may seem to turn entirely on whether the resulting person\nwould be you or I. Only I can be responsible for my\nactions. The fact that some person is me, by itself, gives me a reason\nto care about him. Each person has a special, selfish interest in her\nown future and no one else\u2019s. Identity itself (numerical\nidentity) is what matters in survival. But some say that I could have\nan entirely selfish reason to care about someone else\u2019s future\nfor his own sake. Perhaps what gives me a reason to care about what\nhappens to the man people will call by my name tomorrow is not that he\nis me, but that he is then psychologically continuous with me\nas I am now (see Section 4). If someone else were psychologically\ncontinuous tomorrow with me as I am now, he would have what\nmatters to me and I ought to transfer my selfish concern to him.\nLikewise, someone else could be responsible for my actions, and not\nfor his own. Identity itself has no practical importance. (Sosa (1990)\nand Merricks (2022) argue for the importance of identity; Parfit\n(1971, 1984: 215, 1995) and Martin (1998) argue against.)\n\nThat completes our survey. Though some of these questions may bear on\nothers, they are to a large extent independent. Many discussions of\npersonal identity leave it unclear which one is at stake.\n",
