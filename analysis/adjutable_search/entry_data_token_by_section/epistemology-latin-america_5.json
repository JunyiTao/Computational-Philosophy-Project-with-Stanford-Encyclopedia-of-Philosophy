    "main_text": "Epistemology of Law\n6. Epistemology of Law\n\nWe can also briefly refer to an area that has received some attention\nin recent years, namely, the epistemology of law. In this area, we can\nmention the work of Andr\u00e9s P\u00e1ez and Eleonora Cresto.\n\nP\u00e1ez obtained his B.A. in philosophy from the Universidad de\nlos Andes (Colombia) and his M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from The\nCity University of New York. He is currently a professor at the\nUniversidad de los Andes. While in P\u00e1ez (2014) he examines the\nrelevance of the epistemological debate between reductionism and\nanti-reductionism about testimony to the problem of the reliability of\ntestimonial evidence by focusing on both Colombian and American\nlegislation, in P\u00e1ez (2016) he explores the nature of legal\nreputation from the point of view of social epistemology by\nconsidering recent views on group beliefs.\n\nWe have already discussed Cresto\u2019s work in epistemology in\nprevious sections. Concerning the epistemology of law, while Cresto\n(2015b) outlines a theory of evidence in the legal context by focusing\non a particular model of the inference to the best explanation that is\nbased on elements of decision theory, Cresto (2016) proposes a\nsolution to the problem of judgment aggregation that can be applied to\nthe problem of opinion aggregation in the context of a court of\nappeals or a jury.",
