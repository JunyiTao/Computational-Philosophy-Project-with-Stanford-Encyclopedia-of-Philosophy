    "main_text": "\n\nXenocrates (of Chalcedon, a city on the Asian side of the Bosporus\nopposite Byzantium, according to Diogenes Laertius (D.L.) iv 14),\nbecame head of the Academy after Speusippus died, in 339/338\n(\u201cin the second year of the 110th Olympiad\u201d). D.L. says he\nheld that position for twenty-five years, and died at 82. So his dates\nwork out to 396/395\u2013314/313.\n\nOn the death of Plato, when Speusippus became head of the Academy,\nXenocrates and Aristotle may have left Athens together at the\ninvitation of Hermeias of Atarneus (see Strabo XIII 57, printed in\nGaiser 1988, 380\u2013381, discussed at 384\u2013385), and\nXenocrates returned to succeed Speusippus. According to D.L. (iv 3),\nthis was at Speusippus\u2019 request, while the Academicorum Index\nHerculanensis (cols. VI-VII: Mekler 1902, 38\u201339, Gaiser\n1988, 193) tells us that the younger members of the Academy voted on\nthe succession and confirmed Xenocrates by a narrow margin. These two\naccounts, although not incompatible, do not tell the same story, and\nit does not appear\u00a0 possible to get behind them to what really\nhappened.\n\nD.L.\u2019s bibliography (iv 11\u201314) lists over 70 titles; nothing\nwhatever of these has survived, even in the form of identifiable\nquotations in other authors. Reconstruction of Xenocrates\u2019 views\nturns, as in the case of Speusippus, on Aristotle, and, again as in\nthe case of Speusippus, this is made the more difficult by Aristotle\u2019s\nfrequent failure actually to name Xenocrates when talking about his\nviews. In fact, Aristotle never mentions Xenocrates by name in\ndiscussing his metaphysical views.\n\nWhat is left of Xenocrates\u2019 views is here divided up under three\nheadings: Metaphysics, Theory of Knowledge, and Ethics. Sextus\nEmpiricus tells us (Adversus mathematicos vii 16; fr. 1H,\n82IP: here and in the sequel \u2018H\u2019 refers to the collection\nof fragments in Heinze 1892 and \u2018IP\u2019 to that in Isnardi\nParente 1982) that Xenocrates was explicit about the division of\nphilosophical topics implicit in Plato, into \u2018physics\u2019,\n\u2018ethics\u2019, and \u2018logic\u2019; this became the norm in\nStoicism and Hellenistic philosophy in general. We have a great deal\nmore to work with under the first heading than under the other two. As\nis standard with this terminology, what we are accustomed to refer to\nas metaphysics and theory of knowledge are included in\n\u2018physics\u2019 and \u2018logic\u2019, respectively.\n\nSextus\u2019 report about the standard division of philosophy coming\nthrough Xenocrates but ultimately from Plato is typical of much of\nwhat we hear about Xenocrates: he appears to have been at least as\nconcerned to carry on the thought of Plato as to promulgate ideas of\nhis own.\n",
