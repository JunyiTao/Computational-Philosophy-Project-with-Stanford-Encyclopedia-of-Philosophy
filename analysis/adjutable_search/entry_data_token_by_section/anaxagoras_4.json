    "main_text": "Metaphysical Principles || No Smallest or Largest\n2.3 No Smallest or Largest\n\n\nB1\u2019s claim that \u201call things were together\u201d before the\noriginal rotation occurred does not guarantee the truth of the\nEverything-in-Everything principle. If separation occurs within an\noriginal mixture of everything with everything, as a result of the\nmotion imparted by nous, then it could be that, given enough\ntime, ingredients would be segregated from one another (as they are in\nEmpedocles during the triumph of Strife, when the four roots are\ncompletely separated). Anaxagoras needs to block this, so that he can\nmaintain his commitment to the No Becoming principle. In some region\nthat came by separation to contain, say, nothing but bone, there would\ncome to be pure bone (as a new entity), in replacement for and\ndestruction of the mixture that was previously there. He blocks this\npossibility by claiming that there is no smallest (and no largest). If\nthere is no lower limit on the density of an ingredient, then no\ningredient will be completely removed from any region of the mixture\nthrough the force of the rotary motion caused by\nnous. Here are Anaxagoras\u2019 claims:\n\n\n\nNor of the small is there a smallest, but always a smaller (for\nwhat-is cannot not be) \u2014 but also of the large there is always a\nlarger. And [the large] is equal to the small in extent\n(pl\u00eathos), but in relation to itself each thing is both\nlarge and small.\n (B3[3])\n\n\nSince the shares of the large and the small are equal in number, in\nthis way too, all things will be in everything; nor is it possible that\n[anything] be separate, but all things have a share of\neverything. Since it is not possible that there is a least, it\nwould not be possible that [anything] be separated, nor come to be by\nitself, but just as in the beginning, now too all things are together.\n(B6 [in part])\n\n\n\nThe passage from B6 makes clear that the \u201cno smallest\u201d\nprinciple is connected to the principle of Everything-in-Everything,\nand B3 asserts that the \u201cno smallest\u201d claim depends on the\nimpossibility of what-is-not. Here is one way to interpret what\nAnaxagoras is saying: if there were a smallest (particle, density,\namount) of any ingredient (call it S), we could in principle\nthrough separation reduce the amount of S in some area of the\nmixture to that smallest, and then induce further separation through\nrotation, which would remove that ingredient from a particular area of\nthe mixture. That would leave some area without \u201ceverything\nin everything.\u201d The area would cease to be S to\nany degree and so would be not-S. In that area, the\nexplanation of coming-to-be in terms of emergence from a previous\nmixture would fail. Note that Anaxagoras \u2014 like other Greek\nthinkers, including Plato \u2014 assumes that anything that is\nmust be something or other and so slides easily between \u201cwhat is\nnot f\u201d and \u201cwhat is not\u201d (Furley\n2002).\n\n\nAnaxagoras\u2019 solution is to deny that there is any lower limit\non smallness. Adopting the model of density described above, he\ncan say that there is no lowest degree of density in the mixture.\nThis emphasis on density makes it clear that Anaxagoras\u2019\ntechnical sense of smallness is not one of particle size but of degree\nof submergence or emergence in the mixture. For an ingredient to\nbe small is for there to be a comparatively low density of that\ningredient in a particular area of the mixture in comparison with all\nthe other ingredients (everything else) in that area. The\ncorresponding assertion that there is no upper limit on largeness can\nthen be interpreted as the claim that no matter how emergent from the\nmixture (standing out from the background mixture) an ingredient is, it\ncan become still more emergent. So, no matter how sweet some water\ntastes, there is still some salt in it. The salt in the sample is\nsmall, i.e., submerged in the mixture of water and other ingredients,\nbut there will never cease to be salt in the sample.\nCorrespondingly, no matter how salty another sample is, it can always\nbecome more salty and even \u201cturn to salt\u201d because there is\nno upper limit to the degree of emergence from the background. As\nthe salt emerges, other ingredients will submerge, but will never\ndisappear, so that the wet itself is deeply submerged in the mix, and\nwe are left with an apparently solid block of salt (though that salt\nwill itself contain all other ingredients, with most of them in such\nsmall concentrations that they are completely submerged and not\napparent to an observer). This account of large and small is\nimplied in Schofield 1980, and worked out more fully in Inwood 1986 and\nFurth 1991; it is accepted in Curd 2007; see also Marmodoro 2017.\n",
