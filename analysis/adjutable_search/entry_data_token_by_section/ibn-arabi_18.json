    "main_text": "Human Perfection\n6. Human Perfection\n\nLike the philosophers, Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee sees the human soul as\nan unlimited potential and understands the goal of life to lie in the\nactualization of that potential. Avicenna sums up the philosophical\nview in a passage found in two of his major works:\n\nThe perfection specific to the rational soul is for her to become an\nintellective world within which is represented the form of the All,\nthe arrangement intelligible in the All, and the good that is effused\nupon the All\u2026. She turns into an intelligible world, parallel\nwith the entire existent world, and witnesses what is unconditioned\ncomeliness, unconditioned good, and real, unconditioned beauty while\nshe is unified with it, imprinted with its likeness and guise, strung\nupon its thread, and coming to be of its substance. (Avicenna,\nal-Shif\u00e2\u2019, 350; Avicenna,\nal-Naj\u00e2t, 3:293)\n\n\nIbn \u2018Arab\u00ee agrees with this general picture, but he\nconsiders it barren, because it fails to take into account those\ndimensions of reality\u2014the vast majority of dimensions, as he\nsees it\u2014that do not properly belong to the world of\nintellection; all the intermediary realms, not to speak of the\nsensible realm itself, are essentially imaginal, not intelligible. He\ninsists, in fact, that \u201cImagination is the widest known\nthing\u201d because \u201cit exercises its properties through its\nreality over every thing and non-thing. It gives form to absolute\nnonexistence, the impossible, the Necessary, and possibility; it makes\nexistence nonexistent and nonexistence existent\u201d (Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee, al-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition,\n1:306.17, 306.6).\n\nIn several passages, Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee describes the ascent of\nthe soul on the ladder (mi\u2018r\u00e2j) to God. One of\nthese is Chapter 167 of the Openings, called \u201cOn the true\nknowledge of the alchemy of happiness\u201d. Here he contrasts the\nparallel ladders of a philosopher and a prophet\u2019s follower. In\neach stage, the follower meets what Muhammad met in his Night Journey,\nbut the philosopher finds only what his knowledge of the natural world\nallows him to find; in short, when seekers pass through the ascending\nrealms of the mundus imaginalis, they gain what accords with\ntheir own cognitive preparation. In the first heaven, for example, the\nfollower meets the prophet Adam, whom God had \u201ctaught all the\nnames\u201d, and he benefits from Adam\u2019s omniscience, but the\nphilosopher meets only the moon. In each successive level, the\nfollower encounters a prophet and assimilates his knowledge, but the\nphilosopher finds the celestial spheres (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, Chapter 167, 1997, 2019). It is worth\nnoting that Avicenna himself had written an interpretation of\nMuhammad\u2019s night journey in philosophical terms that runs\nparallel to what Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee ascribes to the philosopher\nhere, but the text was in Persian, so Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee would not\nhave seen it (Heath 1992).\n",
