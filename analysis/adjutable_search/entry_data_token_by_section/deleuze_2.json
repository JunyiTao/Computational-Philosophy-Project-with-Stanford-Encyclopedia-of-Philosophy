    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Difference || Difference and Repetition\n3.1 Difference and Repetition\n\nDeleuze\u2019s historical monographs were, in a sense, preliminary\nsketches for the great canvas of Difference and Repetition\n(1968), which marshaled these resources from the history of philosophy\nin an ambitious project to construct a \u201cphilosophy of\ndifference.\u201d Following Maimon\u2019s critique, Difference\nand Repetition produces a two-fold shift from the Kantian project\nof providing the universal and necessary conditions for possible\nexperience. First, rather than seeking the conditions for\npossible experience, Deleuze wants to provide an account of\nthe genesis of real experience, that is, the experience of\nthis concretely existing individual here and now. Second, to respect\nthe demands of the philosophy of difference, the genetic principle\nmust itself be a differential principle.\n\nHowever, despite these departures, Deleuze maintains a crucial\nalignment with Kant; Difference and Repetition is still a\ntranscendental approach. Here we should remind ourselves that the\nterms \u201ctranscendent\u201d and \u201ctranscendental\u201d have\nopposing significations. Transcendental philosophy in fact critiques\nthe pretensions of other philosophies to transcend experience by\nproviding strict criteria for the use of syntheses immanent to\nexperience. On this score, at least, Deleuze aligns himself with\nKant\u2019s critical philosophy.\n\nThree further preliminary notes are in order here. First, as we will\ndiscuss in section 4 below, the Capitalism and Schizophrenia\nproject of Deleuze and Guattari will bring to the fore naturalist\ntendencies that are only implicitly present in the still-Kantian\nframework of Difference and Repetition. So, although there is\nsome risk of reading backwards in this formulation, we can say that\nthe \u201cof\u201d in the phrase \u201cthe experience of this\nconcretely existing individual here and now\u201d is both subjective\nand objective. It is the experience by human subjects of this\nindividual object in front of it, and it is the experience enjoyed by\nthe concretely existing individual itself, even when that individual\nis non-human or even non-living. (Deleuze\u2019s panpsychism is\ntreated briefly in Protevi 2011.) Second, then, in the demand for\ngenetic principles to account for the real experience of concrete\nindividuals, Deleuze is working in the tradition of the Principle of\nSufficient Reason. Third, the notion of \u201cgenesis\u201d is\nitself double; in Chapter 3, Deleuze lays out a dynamic genesis that\nmoves from an encounter with intensity in sensation to the thinking of\nvirtual Ideas, while Chapters 4 and 5 lay out a static genesis that\nmoves from the virtual Idea through an intensive individuation process\nto an actual entity.\n\nWe are now ready to discuss the book itself. Murphy 1992 suggests that\nthe first part of the book (the Introduction and Chapters 1 and 2)\nconstitutes Deleuze\u2019s treatment of the history of philosophy,\nwhile in the second part of the book (Chapters 4 and 5) Deleuze is\ndoing philosophy in his own name. From this point of view, Chapter 3,\non the \u201cimage of thought,\u201d plays a pivotal role, leading\nus into Deleuze\u2019s own philosophy. This transitional role of\nChapter 3 is confirmed elsewhere when Deleuze says that the study of\nthe image of thought is the \u201cprolegomena to philosophy\u201d\n(Negotiations, 149).\n\nIn Chapters 1 and 2, to find a differential genetic principle, Deleuze\nworks through the history of philosophy to isolate the concepts of\n\u201cdifference in itself\u201d and \u201crepetition for\nitself\u201d that the assumptions of previous philosophies had\nprevented from being formulated. \u201cDifference in itself\u201d is\ndifference that is freed from identities seen as metaphysically\nprimary. Normally, difference is conceived of as an empirical relation\nbetween two terms which each has a prior identity of its own (\u201cx\nis different from y\u201d). Deleuze inverts this priority: identity\npersists, but is now a something produced by a prior relation between\ndifferentials (dx rather than not-x). Difference is no longer\nan empirical relation but becomes a transcendental principle that\nconstitutes the sufficient reason of empirical diversity (for example,\nit is the difference of electrical potential between cloud and ground\nthat constitutes the sufficient reason of the phenomenon of\nlightning).\n\nIn Chapter 2, the concept of \u201crepetition for itself\u201d is\nproduced as repetition that is freed from being repetition of an\noriginal self-identical thing so that it can be the repetition of\ndifference. Following the formula of Deleuze\u2019s reading of\nNietzsche\u2019s eternal return, repetition is the return of the\ndifferential genetic condition of real experience each time there is\nan individuation of a concrete entity. Ultimately, then,\nDifference and Repetition will show that the individuation of\nentities is produced by the actualization, integration, or resolution\n(the terms are synonymous for Deleuze) of a differentiated virtual\nfield of Ideas or \u201cmultiplicities\u201d that are themselves\nchanged, via \u201ccounter-effectuation,\u201d in each individuating\nevent.\n\nChapter 3 lays out 8 postulates of the \u201cdogmatic image of\nthought.\u201d Between the first four and last four postulates we\nfind a theory of the faculties, which is thus at the crossroads of\nboth the chapter and the book.\n\nLet us take up the first four postulates. The first postulate concerns\nour supposed natural disposition to think; the denial of this is what\nnecessitates our being forced to think. The second and third\npostulates concern subjective and objective unity. Subjective unity is\ncaptured by the notion of \u201ccommon sense\u201d such that our\nfaculties of sensation, memory, imagination, and thought work in\nharmony, while objective unity is captured by the notion of\n\u201crecognition\u201d such that it is the same object that is\nsensed, remembered, imagined, and thought. The fourth postulate\nconcerns \u201crepresentation\u201d, a key target of Deleuze\u2019s\ncritique. Here difference is submitted to a fourfold structure that\nrenders difference subordinate to identity: 1) identity in the\nconcept; 2) opposition of predicates; 3) analogy in judgment; and 4)\nresemblance in perception. A good way to approach Deleuze\u2019s\nnotion of representation is via Aristotle and Porphyry. Specific\ndifferences are the opposed predicates that function on a horizon of\nidentity in the concept under division; thus animal is the genus that\nis divided into rational and irrational as specific differences that\nenable the isolation of the species \u201chuman.\u201d Then, we find\nthat the difference between individuals of the same species is\ninfra-conceptual and can only be made via the perception of\nresemblances; Theaetetus looks like Socrates but not so much that they\ncannot be distinguished. Finally, the relation of substance to the\nother categories is analogical, such that being is said in many ways,\nbut with substance as the primary way in which it is said.\n\nAfter the first four postulates, we find the theory of the faculties,\nwhich will be Deleuze\u2019s account of what it means to be\n\u201cforced\u201d to think in differential rather than identitarian\nterms. To free a notion of \u201cdifference in itself\u201d such\nthat difference need not be thought on the basis of a prior horizon of\nidentity, Deleuze looks for an \u201cencounter,\u201d a sensation\nthat cannot be thought, that cannot find the empirical category under\nwhich an object can be recognized, and thus forces the\n\u201ctranscendent exercise\u201d of the faculty of sensibility,\nwhen something can only be sensed.\n\nHere we see the dynamic genesis from intensity in sensation to the\nthinking of virtual Ideas. Each step here has a distinct Kantian echo.\nThe faculties are linked in order; here Deleuze as well as Kant look\nto the privilege of sensibility as the origin of knowledge\u2014the\n\u201ctruth of empiricism.\u201d With sensibility, pure difference\nin intensity is grasped immediately in the encounter as the\nsentiendum, that which can only be sensed. In the\ndifferential theory of the faculties, sensibility, imagination,\nmemory, and thought all \u201ccommunicate a violence\u201d from one\nto the other\u2014here Deleuze works with the Kantian notion of the\nsublime as discordant accord of the faculties. The \u201cfree form of\ndifference\u201d in intensity moves each faculty and communicates its\nviolence to the next, though in this case there is no supernatural\nvocation that will redeem the conflict of imagination and reason, as\nthere is in the resolution to the discussion of the sublime in the\nCritique of Judgment. Rather than a reconciliation of the\nfaculties, with thought, a \u201cfractured self\u201d\u2014here\nDeleuze takes up Kant\u2019s notion of the split between the\nempirical ego and the Transcendental subject\u2014is constrained to\nthink \u201cdifference in itself\u201d in Ideas.\n\nWe won\u2019t discuss the last four postulates in detail, as they\nconcern the theory of Ideas, the topic of Chapter 4, which we will\nshortly discuss. For now, let us note that two of Deleuze\u2019s\ntechnical terms, intensity and virtuality, occupy two different places\non this line of dynamic genesis. Intensity is the characteristic of\nthe encounter, and sets off the process of thinking, while virtuality\nis the characteristic of the Idea.\n\nWith the notions of intensive and extensive we come upon a crucial\ndistinction for Deleuze that is explored in Chapters 4 and 5 of\nDifference and Repetition. Extensive quantities, such as\nlength, area or volume, are divisible. A volume of matter divided into\ntwo equal halves produces two volumes, each having half the extent of\nthe original one. Intensive magnitudes, by contrast, refer to\nproperties such as temperature or pressure that cannot be so divided.\nIf a volume of water whose temperature is 90\u00ba is divided in half,\nthe result is two volumes at the original temperature, not two volumes\nat 45\u00ba. However, the important property of intensity is not that\nit is indivisible, but that it is a property that cannot be divided\nwithout involving a change in kind. The temperature of a volume of\nwater, for instance, can be \u201cdivided\u201d by heating the\ncontainer from below, causing a temperature difference between the top\nand the bottom. In so doing, however, we change the system\nqualitatively; moreover, if the temperature differences reach a\ncertain threshold (if they attain a certain \u201cintensity\u201d in\nDeleuze\u2019s terms), the system will undergo a \u201cphase\ntransition,\u201d losing symmetry and changing its dynamics, entering\ninto a periodic pattern of motion\u2014convection\u2014which\ndisplays extensive properties of size: X centimeters of length and\nbreadth. Drawing on these kinds of analyses, Deleuze will assign a\ntranscendental status to the intensive: intensity, he argues,\nconstitutes the genetic condition of extensive space. Intensive\nprocesses are themselves in turn structured by Ideas or\nmultiplicities.\n\nAn Idea or multiplicity is really a process of progressive\ndetermination of differential elements, differential relations, and\nsingularities. Let us take these step-by-step. \u201cElements\u201d\nmust have no independent existence from the system in which they\ninhere; phonemes as the elements of the virtual linguistic Idea are an\nexample Deleuze uses in Difference and Repetition. When\nphonemes are actualized, they enter into differential relations that\ndetermine the patterns of individual languages; thus the English\nphoneme /p/ is reciprocally determined by its differences from /t/,\n/b/, /d/, and so on. Finally, these differential relations of an\nindividual language determine singularities or remarkable points at\nwhich the pattern of that language can shift: the Great Vowel Shift of\nMiddle English being an example, or more prosaically, dialect\npronunciation shifts.\n\nFor another example\u2014and here, in the applicability of his schema\nto widely divergent registers, is one of the aspects of Deleuze as\nmetaphysician\u2014let us try to construct the Idea of hurricanes.\nThe differential elements would be material \u201cflows\u201d driven\nby intensive differences in temperature and pressure but undetermined\nin form (neither smooth nor turbulent, neither big nor small) and\nfunction (neither forming nor destroying of weather events). These\nflows qua differential elements enter into relations of reciprocal\ndetermination linking changes in any one element to changes in the\nothers; thus temperature and pressure differences will link changes in\nair and water currents to each other: updrafts are related to\ndowndrafts even if the exact relations (the tightness of the links,\nthe velocity of the flows) are not yet determined. Finally, at\nsingular points in these relations singularities are determined that\nmark qualitative shifts in the system, such as the formation of\nthunderstorm cells, the eye wall, and so on. But this is still the\nvirtual Idea of hurricanes; real existent hurricanes will have\nmeasurable values of these variables so that we can move from the\nphilosophical realm of sufficient reason to that of scientific\ncausation. A hurricane is explained by its Idea, but it is caused by\nreal wind currents driven by real temperature supplied by the sun to\ntropical waters.\n\nTo see how Ideas are transcendental and immanent, we have to\nappreciate that an Idea is a concrete universal. In an early article\non Bergson (\u201cThe Conception of Difference in Bergson\u201d\n[1956]), Deleuze gave a particularly helpful example of this notion.\nIn La Pens\u00e9e et le Mouvant, Bergson had shown that\nthere are two ways of determining what the spectrum of\n\u201ccolors\u201d have in common. (1) You can extract from\nparticular colors an abstract and general idea of color (\u201cby\nremoving from the red that which makes it red, from the blue what\nmakes it blue, from the green what makes it green\u201d). Or, (2) you\ncan make all these colors \u201cpass through a convergent lens,\nbringing them to a single point,\u201d in which case a \u201cpure\nwhite light\u201d is obtained that \u201cmakes the differences\nbetween the shades stand out.\u201d The former case defines a single\ngeneric \u201cconcept\u201d with a plurality of objects; the\nrelation between concept and object is one of subsumption; and the\nstate of difference remains exterior to the thing. The second case, on\nthe contrary, defines a differential Idea in the Deleuzean sense: the\ndifferent colors are no longer objects under a concept, but constitute\nan order of mixture in coexistence and succession within the Idea; the\nrelation between the Idea and a given color is not one of subsumption,\nbut one of actualization and differenciation; and the state of\ndifference between the concept and the object is internalized in the\nIdea itself, so that the concept itself has become the object. White\nlight is still a universal, but it is a concrete universal, and not a\ngenus or generality.\n\nThe Idea of color is thus like white light, which\n\u201cperplexes\u201d within itself the genetic elements and\nrelations of all the colors, but which is actualized in the diverse\ncolors and their respective spaces. (Like the word\n\u201cproblem,\u201d Deleuze uses the word \u201cperplexion\u201d\nto signify, not a coefficient of doubt, hesitation, or astonishment,\nbut the multiple and virtual state of Ideas. Indeed, Deleuze adopts a\nnumber of Neoplatonic notions to indicate the structure of Ideas, all\nof which are derived from the root word pli [fold]:\nperplication, complication, implication, explication, and\nreplication.) Similarly, the Idea of sound could be conceived of as a\nwhite noise, just as there is also a white society or a white\nlanguage, which contains in its virtuality all the phonemes and\nrelations destined to be actualized in the diverse languages and in\nthe remarkable parts of a same language.\n\nWe can now move to discuss Chapter 5, on the individuation of\nconcretely existing real entities as the actualization of a virtual\nIdea. In isolating the conditions of genesis, Deleuze sets up a\ntripartite ontological scheme, positing three interdependent\nregisters: the virtual, intensive, and actual. Deleuze\u2019s basic\nnotion is that in all realms of being intensive morphogenetic\nprocesses follow differential virtual multiplicities to produce\nlocalized and individuated actual substances with extensive\nproperties. Simply put, the actualization of the virtual proceeds by\nway of intensive processes. Beneath the actual (any one state of a\nsystem), we find \u201cimpersonal individuations\u201d or intensive\nmorphogenetic processes that produce system states and beneath these\nwe find \u201cpre-individual singularities\u201d (that is, the key\nelements in virtual fields, marking system thresholds that structure\nthe intensive morphogenetic processes). We thus have to distinguish\nthe intense \u201cimpersonal\u201d field of individuation and its\nprocesses from the virtual \u201cpre-individual\u201d field of\ndifferential relations and singularities that make up an Idea or\nmultiplicity.\n\nTying together the themes of difference, multiplicity, virtuality and\nintensity, at the heart of Difference and Repetition we find\na theory of Ideas (dialectics) based neither on an essential model of\nidentity (Plato), nor a regulative model of unity (Kant), nor a\ndialectical model of contradiction (Hegel), but rather on a\nproblematic and genetic model of difference. Ideas define the being of\na thing, but one cannot attain an Idea through the Socratic question\n\u201cWhat is \u2026 ?\u201d (which posits Ideas as transcendent\nand eternal), but rather through \u201cminor\u201d questions such as\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d \u201cHow many?\u201d \u201cIn which\ncase?\u201d \u201cFrom which viewpoint?\u201d\u2014all of which\nallow one to define the differential Ideas immanent in the intensive\nprocesses they structure.\n\nFrom these examples we can see that Ideas structure the intensive\nprocesses that give rise to the behavior patterns of systems, and\ntheir singularities mark the thresholds at which systems change\nbehavior patterns. In a word, the virtual Idea is the transformation\nmatrix for material systems or bodies. Bodies are determined\n\u201csolutions\u201d to the \u201cproblem\u201d that lays out the\nmanifold options for incarnating bodies of that nature. Ideas then\nrespond to the question \u201cwho?\u201d (who is it that incarnates\nthe Idea in this case?) rather than the essentialist \u201cwhat\nis?\u201d (what are the properties of the substance that provide the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the class of\nwhich the object is a member?)\n\nFor orientation purposes, it\u2019s useful to consider Gilbert\nSimondon\u2019s theory of individuation as a very simple model for\nwhat Deleuze calls \u201cactualization.\u201d For Simondon,\ncrystallization is a paradigm of individuation: a supersaturated\nsolution is metastable; from that pre-individual field, replete with\ngradients of density that are only implicit \u201cforms\u201d or\n\u201cpotential functions,\u201d individual crystals precipitate\nout. The Deleuzean virtual is composed of \u201cIdeas\u201d or\n\u201cmultiplicities\u201d involving differential relations among\nheterogeneous components, whose rates of change are connected with\neach other. For an example of such heterogeneity, let us return to\nhurricane formation, the Idea of which we sketched above. Here it\nshould be intuitively clear that there is no central command, but a\nself-organization of multiple processes of air and water movement\npropelled by temperature and pressure differences. All hurricanes form\nwhen intensive processes of wind and ocean currents reach singular\npoints. These singular points, however, are not unique to any one\nhurricane, but are virtual for each actual hurricane, just as the\nboiling point of water is virtual for each actual pot of tea on the\nstove. In other words, all hurricanes share the same virtual structure\neven as they are singular individuations or actualizations of that\nstructure.\n\nIn this treatment, we have concentrated on only some of the\nmetaphysics in Difference and Repetition; much more could be\nsaid about the role that Nietzsche\u2019s thought of the eternal\nreturn plays therein, in addition to Deleuze\u2019s remarks on a\ndizzying array of figures from Plato and Scotus to Freud and Artaud.\nIn the interests of space, however, let us move to a brief treatment\nof Deleuze\u2019s second major work of the late 1960s, Logic of\nSense.\n",
