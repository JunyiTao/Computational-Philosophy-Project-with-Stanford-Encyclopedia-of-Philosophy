    "main_text": "Instrumental Coherence\n3. Instrumental Coherence\n\nNow we consider instrumental rationality understood as a matter of\nrational coherence. It is often said that someone is being locally\ninstrumentally incoherent insofar as he intends an end, believes,\nroughly, that something is a means to it, but refuses to intend that\nmeans. More precisely, it seems that this is so only when the relevant\nbelief is about necessary means. Suppose that I intend to go\nto Alaska, but believe that flying there is a sufficient, but not\nnecessary, means to going to Alaska. Am I being instrumentally\nincoherent in refusing to intend to fly there? Not obviously: perhaps\nI believe that going by sea is cheaper, and I intend that.\n\nSome suggest that this focus, on intentions and beliefs about\nnecessary means, inspired by Kant\u2019s initial discussion of\nhypothetical imperatives (see\n \u00a74.4\n below), is overly narrow (see Smith 2004 and Wedgwood 2011). Not\nsimply intentions, but also desires, should be considered, and not\nsimply beliefs about necessary means, but also beliefs about\nnon-necessary means should be considered. And others have developed\ntheories of instrumental rationality focused on (intentional) actions,\nas opposed to intentions (see Tenenbaum 2021).\n\nMore precisely still, the relevant belief must be that\nintending the means is itself necessary. Suppose your dentist\nintends to remove your tooth, and believes that a necessary means to\nremoving your tooth is causing you pain. Is she being instrumentally\nincoherent in refusing to intend to cause you pain? Not necessarily:\nshe might believe that she will remove your tooth even if she does not\nintend to cause you pain. But she will, presumably, believe that she\nwill remove your tooth only if she intends to use her\ninstruments. So, though she wouldn\u2019t be irrational in not\nintending to cause you pain, she would be irrational in not intending\nto use her instruments (Kamm 2000, 2007; Searle, 2001; Broome\n2003).\n\nMoreover, the relevant belief must be that intending the means\nnow is necessary. Suppose a beginning student intends to earn\na doctoral degree and believes that, when the dissertation is\ncompleted, intending to submit the final paperwork is necessary for\nearning the degree. It is not clear that she is being instrumentally\nincoherent in refusing to intend, now, to submit that paperwork. She\nmay trust that, when the time comes, she will intend it (Setiya 2007).\nThis suggests, as Raz notes, that opportunities for instrumental\nincoherence may actually be very rare.\n\nEven with the content of the relevant belief being restricted in these\nways, worries might still arise given that (all-out) belief falls\nshort of certainty. Suppose I believe the only way to arrive on time\nis to steal my neighbor\u2019s car, which I\u2019m unwilling to. But\nI also think there\u2019s a very small chance I could bike in and\narrive on time. (This is compatible with my all-out believing\nI\u2019ll arrive on time only if I steal my neighbor\u2019s car.)\nOne might argue that it\u2019s rationally permissible to intend to\narrive on time in such a case (Nu\u00f1ez 2020). However, perhaps we\nshould instead say here that it\u2019s rationally permissible to have\nthe goal, or aim, of arriving on time, not the\nintention to arrive on time.\n\nThere seems to be considerable agreement, then, on what we might call\nthe:\n\nViolation Claim:\nIf one is instrumentally incoherent\u2014i.e., one intends at\nt to E, believes at t that one will\nE only if one intends at t to M, but does\nnot (or, more restrictively, refuses to) intend at t to\nM\u2014then one violates some requirement.\n\n\nBut it is unclear exactly what requirement one violates. Additionally,\nit is unclear whether the requirement violated would be\n\u201cnormative\u201d in the sense that one ought not to violate it.\nIn other words, it is unclear whether, in being instrumentally\nincoherent, one violates a requirement of reason, in the\nsense of \u201creason\u201d identified earlier. In the remainder of\nthis section, we\u2019ll consider some possible answers to these\nquestions.\n\nFirst,\n (\u00a73.1)\n we might say that there isn\u2019t any requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such, but whenever one is\ninstrumentally incoherent, one violates some independent\nrequirement of reason. Second,\n (\u00a73.2)\n we might say that there is a requirement of reason to be\ninstrumentally coherent as such. Third,\n (\u00a73.3)\n we might deny that one necessarily violates a requirement of reason\nin being instrumentally incoherent; perhaps the normativity of\ninstrumental coherence is merely apparent, or the requirement merely\nevaluative (it may be a standard of proper functioning without giving\nanyone reason to comply with it). Fourth,\n (\u00a73.4)\n one might think, given the ways in which intention is thought to\ninvolve belief, that in being instrumentally incoherent, one violates\na requirement of theoretical rationality.\n\nThere are, of course, other answers that could be given. (For\ninstance, we briefly discuss a constitutivist approach to instrumental\nincoherence, attributed to Kant, in\n \u00a74.4)\n But consideration of these approaches will give a reasonably\ncomprehensive picture of the recent attempts to explain the Violation\nClaim.\n",
