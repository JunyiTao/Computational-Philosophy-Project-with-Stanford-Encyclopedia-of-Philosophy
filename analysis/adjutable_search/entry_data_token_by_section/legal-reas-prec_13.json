    "main_text": "The Justification for Analogical Reasoning\n5. The Justification for Analogical Reasoning\n\n\nWhy does the law make use of arguments by analogy, rather than simply\ndeciding novel cases on their own merits?  In ordinary moral\ndeliberation, analogies are used to argue that one disputed situation\nis indistinguishable from another situation where the merits are\nrelatively clear. They leave three main responses open: (a) that the\ncase is indeed indistinguishable since the same rationale applies to\nboth; (b) that the case is distinguishable; or (c) that the case is\nindistinguishable, but upon reflection the assessment of the original\ncase was mistaken. (Reflection on another case might, of course, lead\none to conclude that one's original assessment was mistaken, even\nthough the two cases are distinguishable.)  As a result,\nanalogies are useful heuristic devices for deepening and sharpening\nreflection on the merits. It is also the case that people are often\nmore confident in their judgements about various concrete cases than\nthey are about abstract theories that attempt to account for their\njudgements, and so regard this is a more profitable way to approach a\nquestion (see Sunstein 1993, 775\u20137).\n\n\nIn law, by contrast, analogies carry a weight additional to the merits\nof the case. The approach of courts is complex. Some decisions and\ndoctrines are regarded as mistakes and have no analogical\nweight. Other doctrines may be regarded as imperfect\u2014not wholly\ncorrect\u2014but do have analogical weight. Other still may be\nregarded as simply correct, and their existence provides further\nsupport for adopting the view in the novel case. There are a number of\npossible indirect benefits that accrue from the practice of analogical\nreasoning, such as exposing judges to a wider variety of fact\nsituations than the particular set before them, making them consider\nthe views of other judges in previous cases and exerting a\nconservative pressure on individual decision-makers (see Sherwin\n1999). But is there any more fundamental rationale to the form of\nreasoning?\n\n\nLike precedent, analogies cannot be justified by recourse to\nexpectations. Whether there is an expectation of analogies being\nfollowed, such expectations will only be justified if there are good\nindependent reasons for using analogies in this way. Consistency may\nprovide a rationale for a limited exercise of analogy. Where an\nearlier case has settled some indeterminacy in the application of the\nlaw, and where the rationale for the earlier decision is equally\napplicable to the later facts, then it would be inconsistent to decide\nthe later case differently.\n\n\nThe strongest justification for analogical reasoning, however, lies in\nthe value of replicability. This is often put in terms of the\nimportance of \u2018coherence\u2019 in the law (MacCormick 1978,\n153, 187\u20138; Sunstein 1993, 778\u20139; see also Raz 1979,\n204\u20136 on \u2018partial reform\u2019). Arguments in favour of\ncoherence normally emphasise its instrumental\n value.[22]\n This is tied up with the replicability of legal\ndecision-making. There are two important characteristics of legal\ndecision-making. The first is the fragmentary nature of legal\nmaterials. The second is the plurality of decision-making\nbodies. Legal materials\u2014precedents, statutes, conventions,\nprinciples\u2014are fragmentary in two senses: (a) they are the work\nof many different hands at different times and with different outlooks\nand (b) different areas of law owe more to some hands and times than\nothers. As a result legal doctrine tends to exhibit only a thin global\ncoherence, whereas it may possess a thick local coherence.  The\npluralism of decision-makers is also two-fold: (a) there are many\nindividuals making decisions using the same body of materials, and (b)\nthese individuals do not share a uniform evaluative outlook. Given the\nfragmentary nature of legal material and the plurality of\ndecision-makers there is considerable scope for disagreement when\ndecision-makers are faced with novel questions.\n\n\nAnalogical reasoning helps to make the outcome of cases more\npredictable by giving weight to existing legal decisions and\ndoctrines. But it only does so against a certain background, one where\ndespite decision-makers not sharing a uniform normative outlook, there\nis a large measure of agreement on the existence and importance of\ncertain values. A certain level of agreement is required for\ndecision-makers to see a case as analogous, since that rests\non what they judge to be the proper justification for the earlier\ndecision. It also means that while they may disagree on the resolution\nreached in various cases, the disagreement is unlikely to be profound,\nbut reasonable. (For an argument that this requirement can be\noverstated, see Sunstein 1993, 769\u201373).\n\n\nThe use of analogies in law, then, serves to compensate for some of\nthe indeterminacy which flows from fragmented materials and the\npluralism of decision-makers. That a close analogy exists usually\nprovides a good reason for deciding the case the same way, since it\nrenders the law more replicable than it would otherwise be, and\nenables lawyers to predict more accurately how a situation will be\ntreated by the law. Of course, this is only a relative value:\nanalogies can be defeated by other considerations if there is a good\nbasis for distinguishing, or if its merits are too weak. \n",
