    "main_text": "Personal Relationship Goods in General || Material and Non-Material Needs\n2.2 Material and Non-Material Needs\n\nBecause of their central concern with meeting needs, care ethicists\nhave identified different goods generated by different types of caring\nrelationships; for instance, according to Ruddick, the three main aims\nof mothering are to protect the child from physical harm, to foster\nher physical, emotional and intellectual growth and to socialize her\n(Ruddick 1989). To fulfill such aims, and especially the second two,\none has to provide a mix of material and non-material care-giving.\nCare ethicists in general have not operated with the distinction\nbetween material and non-material care-giving. This distinction is\ncrucial for establishing which are the goods that can be uniquely\nrealized in caring, and, more generally, in personal relationships.\nAnd some have proposed definitions of care that indirectly exclude\nsome of the personal relationship goods from the scope of care. For\ninstance, according to Engster, care is\n\n\neverything we do directly to help individuals to meet their vital\nbiological needs, develop or maintain their basic capabilities, and\navoid or alleviate unnecessary or unwanted pain and suffering, so that\nthey can survive, develop and function in society. (Engster 2007:\n29)\n\n\nThis implies that meeting some of the psychological needs of an adult\nfriend\u2014those related to flourishing rather than with avoiding\nsuffering\u2014may not qualify as care.\n\nYet, material care-giving may be available outside any (personal)\nrelationship: for instance, robots can actually or conceivably provide\nit. It is likely that the goods that require only material care-giving\ncan be realized outside any relationship with people and therefore are\nnot personal relationship goods. Note that the distinction between\nmaterial and non-material care-giving does not overlap with that\nbetween material and non-material needs: It may take some non-material\ncare-giving in order to meet a material need\u2014if, for instance,\nit turned out that physical health and normal development depends in\npart on providing emotional nurturance. Further, it might matter\nnon-materially that some material needs are supplied by a person\nrather than a robot.\n\nIt is normatively important whether some non-material care-giving,\ntoo, can be given outside relationships\u2014for instance, whether\nrobots can successfully be used to meet the psychological needs that\nare usually met by those who relate to us within caring relationships.\nSome argue that we should use robots to make certain kinds of\nemotional care-giving available\u2014for instance, to ensure that\nelderly people living alone (usually in highly atomized societies)\nhave access to robot-provided companionship (Aronson 2014). However,\none can plausibly assume that no robot can provide genuine\ncompanionship, which requires access to another individual\u2019s\nmind. (At least, as Brake (2017) notes, unless and until we will have\ndeveloped true artificial intelligence.) The same is true for other\npersonal relationship goods\u2014attention, affection, sympathy,\nencouragement etc.\u2014which are necessary to meet psychological\nneeds. Therefore, of the senses of \u201ccare\u201d outlined above,\nthe most relevant for personal relationship goods is that of caring\nrelationships (see also Brake 2017).\n",
