It may be worthwhile, therefore, to\ndevote a few remarks to the perception and reception of his work.\n\n\nBoltzmann is often portrayed as a staunch defender of the atomic view\nof matter, at a time when the dominant opinion in the German-speaking\nphysics community, led by influential authors like Mach and Ostwald,\ndisapproved of this view. Indeed, the story goes, in the late\nnineteenth century any attempt at all to search for a hypothetical,\nmicrophysical underpinning of macroscopic phenomena was regarded as\nsuspicious. Further, serious criticism on his work was raised by\nLoschmidt and Zermelo. Various passages in Boltzmann's writing,\nespecially in the late 1890s, complain that his work was hardly\nnoticed (entitling one article \u201cOn some of my lesser-known papers on\ngas theory and their relation to the same\u201d (1879b) or even about a\n\u201chostile attitude\u201d (1898a, v) towards gas theory, and of his awareness\nof \u201cbeing a powerless individual struggling against the currents of\nthe time\u201d (ibid.).\n\n\nThus, the myth has arisen that Boltzmann was ignored or resisted by\nhis\n contemporaries.[1]\n Sometimes, his suicide in 1906 is attributed to the injustice he thus\nsuffered, The fact that his death occurred just at the dawn of the\ndefinitive victory of the atomic view in the works of Einstein,\nSmoluchowski, Perrin et al. adds a further touch of drama to this\npicture.\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, Boltzmann's reputation as a theoretical physicist\nwas actually widely known and well-respected. In 1888 he was offered\n(but declined, after a curious sequence of negotiations) a most\nprestigious chair in Berlin. Later, several universities (Vienna,\nMunich, Leipzig) competed to get him appointed, sometimes putting the\nsalaries of several professorships together in their effort (Lindley\n2001). He was elected to membership or honorary membership in many\nacademies (cf. H\u00f6flechner 1994, 192), received honorary doctorates,\nand was also awarded various medals. In short, there is no factual\nevidence for the claim that Boltzmann was ignored or suffered any\nunusual lack of recognition from his contemporaries. His suicide seems\nto have been due to factors in his personal life (depressions and\ndecline of health) rather than to any academic matters.\n\n",
