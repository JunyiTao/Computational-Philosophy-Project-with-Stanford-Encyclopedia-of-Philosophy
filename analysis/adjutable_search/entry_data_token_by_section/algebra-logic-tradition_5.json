De Morgan and Peirce: Relations and Quantifiers in the Algebra of Logic\n\nDe Morgan wrote a series of six papers called \u201cOn the\nSyllogism\u201d in the years 1846 to 1863 (reprinted in De Morgan\n1966). In his efforts to generalize the syllogism, De Morgan replaced\nthe copula \u201cis\u201d with a general binary relation in the\nsecond paper of the series dating from 1850. By allowing different\nbinary relations in the two premises of a syllogism, he was led to\nintroduce the composition of the two binary relations to express the\nconclusion of the syllogism. In this pursuit of generalized syllogisms\nhe introduced various other operations on binary relations, including\nthe converse operation, and he developed a fragment of a calculus for\nthese operations. His main paper on this subject was the fourth in the\nseries, called \u201cOn the syllogism, No. IV, and on the logic of\nrelations\u201d published in 1859 (see De Morgan 1966).\n\nFollowing De Morgan\u2019s paper, Peirce, in his paper \u201cDescription\nof a Notation for the Logic of Relatives, resulting from an\nAmplification of the Conceptions of Boole\u2019s Calculus of Logic\u201d\nfrom 1870, lifted Boole\u2019s work to the setting of binary\nrelations\u2014with binary relations one had, in addition to union,\nintersection and complement, the natural operations of composition and\nconverse. A binary relation was characterized as a set of ordered\npairs (see 3.328). He worked on this new calculus between 1870 and\n1883. Like De Morgan, Peirce also considered a number of other natural\noperations on relations. Peirce\u2019s main paper on the subject was\n\u201cOn the Algebra of Logic\u201d (1880). By employing\nunrestricted unions, denoted by \u03a3, and unrestricted\nintersections, denoted by \u03a0, Peirce thus introduced quantifiers\ninto his algebra of logic.\n\nIn a paper from 1882, \u201cBrief Description of the Algebra of\nRelatives\u201d, reprinted in De Morgan 1966, he used these\nquantifiers to define operations on relations by means of operations\non certain kind of coefficients. De Morgan gets credit for introducing\nthe concept of relation, but Peirce is considered the true creator of\nthe theory of relations (see, e.g., Tarski 1941: 73). However, Peirce\ndid not develop this theory. As Calixto Badesa wrote, \u201cthe\ncalculus of relatives was never to Peirce\u2019s liking\u201d (Badesa\n2004: 32). He considered it too complicated because of the combination\nof class operations with relational ones. Instead, he preferred from\n1885 onwards to develop a \u201cgeneral algebra\u201d including\nquantifiers but no operation on relations. In this way, he arrived at\nan elementary and informal presentation of what is now called\nfirst-order logic (see Badesa 2004, loc. cit.).\n",
