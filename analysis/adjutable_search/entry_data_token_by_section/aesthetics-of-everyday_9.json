    "main_text": "Significance of Everyday Aesthetics\n10. New and Future Developments\n\nWhile everyday aesthetics has matured significantly since its\nrelatively recent emergence in the Western aesthetics discourse, there\nstill remain many tasks to be tackled. In light of the new\ndevelopments described below, possibilities and opportunities abound\nto guide the future of everyday aesthetics.\n\nFirst, many critics, as well as supporters, of everyday aesthetics\npoint out that it needs to be anchored in a firm theoretical\nfoundation (Forsey 2013a; Ratiu 2013; Iannilli 2016). Among the\npossibilities suggested are finding roots in phenomenology,\nstructuralism and poststructuralism, in addition to pragmatism that is\noften cited as the primary root (Potgieter 2017). Also suggested is to\nframe everyday aesthetics as a practical philosophy with its emphasis\non practical knowledge that is contingent and relational as well as\nproviding agency for acting for common good (Vihalem 2016; Ratiu\n2017a). Another suggestion is to provide a theory of aesthetic\nperception based upon a specific mode of attention (Nanay 2016, 2018).\nThese suggestions are made specifically to address and possibly\nresolve the perceived conflicts and tensions debated by everyday\naestheticians between everyday and non-everyday, life and art, theory\nand practice, ordinary and extraordinary, routine and non-routine,\nfamiliar and unfamiliar, and bodily-oriented (lower) senses and\ncognitively-oriented (higher) senses. A firm theoretical footing\nshould also support intersubjectivity of aesthetic experience so as\nnot to render everyday aesthetics hopelessly subjective and trivial,\none of the common criticisms lodged against it. In addition, a\ntheoretical foundation is thought to help illuminate the political\ndimensions of everyday aesthetics, specifically the politically\ncharged regime of the sensible and the increasing aestheticization of\ncommerce and politics that treats people more as consumers than as\ncitizens.\n\nSecond, as was discussed in Section 2, what counts as everyday is a\ncomplicated matter, and one of the complications is the fact that our\nlived world is changing rapidly due to technology as well as climate\nchange. We cannot imagine our everyday life today without the use of\ninternet, social media, Googling, big data, virtual reality, and the\nlike. The future with self-driving vehicles, wearable technology, and\nAI is already here. Although it is safe to assume that in the\nforeseeable future we humans will still negotiate our lives surrounded\nby and interacting with various objects in the way that has always\nbeen familiar to us, our everyday life will increasingly include and\nbe affected by technological advancements. Furthermore, many\npeople\u2019s physical environments consisting of nature and built\nstructures are bound to be transformed by climate change, drastically\nchanging their everyday affairs and cultural practices (Nomikos\n2018).\n\nIf everyday aesthetics has been focused on what has been characterized\nas a relatively stable environment consisting of familiar surroundings\nand material objects, the challenge is to explore whether and how\nrapid changes to the familiar everyday affects the nature of everyday\naesthetics as a discourse. Some works have already begun, indicated by\nthe research on the effects of self-driving vehicles (Mladenovi\u0107,\net al 2019), cartographical tools (Iannilli 2014; Lehtinen 2019), and\nthe prevalence of all kinds of machine in general (Naukkarinen 2019).\nThese researches explore whether and how these machines facilitate an\nengaged experience of the users, how they move aesthetics discourse\nfrom the emphasis on contemplative experiences to immediate,\nbodily-engaged experiences guided by the functionality of the object,\nand how they impact privacy as well as the nature of aesthetics as an\nacademic discipline. It may be the case that the new normal for our\neveryday world becomes a rapid and constant change rather than\nstability and familiarity that have been considered a hallmark of\neveryday life to date. This future projection may require everyday\naestheticians to review some of the presuppositions that have\nsupported their discussion.\n\nThird, everyday aesthetics has become influential in various\ndisciplines and practices outside of philosophical discourse. As\nindicated by many works included in the bibliography, everyday\naesthetics has been embraced as providing both principles and\nstrategies by fields ranging from business, consumerism, healthcare,\nsports, law, science, and education to urban studies, sustainability,\nfashion, and design. This wide acceptance and utilization of everyday\naesthetics is due to its insight regarding the prevalence of\naesthetics in everyone\u2019s lived world, as well as its aspiration\nthat cultivation of aesthetic literacy and sensibility will contribute\nto improving one\u2019s wellbeing, social interactions, and the state\nof the society and the world. But the challenge, as well as\nopportunity, posed by these heterogeneous discipline-specific\npractices is to inquire whether there is an overarching unifying\nnotion of aesthetic experience and aesthetic practice. Even if there\nis a unifying notion, a further question is whether we should arrive\nat such a notion by building on case studies from these various\ndisciplines (Vihalem 2016).\n\nFinally, in light of an increasing attention to the culture-specific\nnature of various discourses, everyday aesthetics faces both the\nopportunity and challenge for situating its place in a global context.\nGlobalization of aesthetics is actively sought particularly regarding\nart, as indicated by decolonizing the discourses of art, art history,\nand museum practice. It was explained at the beginning of this entry\nthat everyday aesthetics\u2019 emergence was historically and\nculturally situated to challenge what was considered to be\nart-centered aesthetics that dominated the Western aesthetics of the\nlast century. In many cultural traditions, including those that do not\nhave a concept equivalent to the Western notion of art, there is a\nlong legacy of aesthetic interests and concerns permeating, informing,\nand guiding people\u2019s lives, whether regarding the management of\ndaily life, social relationships, spiritual rites, cultural\nactivities, or creation of objects (see Higgins 1996 and Higgins, et\nal. 2017 for a collection of essays representing diverse non-Western\naesthetic traditions). For example, the long-held Chinese tradition of\n\u201caesthetics of living\u201d that has been practiced as a way of\nenhancing the quality of lived experience and contributing to\npeople\u2019s happiness and wellbeing, rather than conceived as an\nabstract theory, is receiving a renewed attention by Chinese scholars\nwho are working on a cross-cultural dialogue (Liu 2014, 2017, 2018;\nPan 2014; Q. Wang 2014). Similarly, Japanese cultural tradition is\ngarnering an increasing interest by those who are exploring how its\naesthetics goes beyond the established arts to inform people\u2019s\neveryday lives (Ikegami 2005; Sasaki 2013; Otabe 2018). Researching\nhow different cultural traditions promote their respective everyday\naesthetic practices helps to highlight the cultural situatedness of\nsome of the assumptions of Western philosophy and aesthetics, such as\nthe relationships between art and life, the theoretical and the\npractical, the subject and the object, as well as between and among\nthe aesthetic, the moral, the social, the practical, the existential,\nand the spiritual.\n\nEveryday aesthetics began its task in the spirit of inclusivity by\nexpanding the materials for deliberation. The discourse continues its\ntask with the same spirit of inclusivity by encouraging\nculture-specific, discipline-specific, and future-speculative\nexplorations, while at the same time searching for a theoretical\nfoundation that allows for intersubjective, intercultural, and\ninterdisciplinary exchanges.\n",
