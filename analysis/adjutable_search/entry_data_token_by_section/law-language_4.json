    "main_text": "Can law be made by the use of language?\n3. Can law be made by the use of language?\n\nDiscussions of the pragmatics of legal language are expressly or\nimplicitly premised on a view of the relation between a law-making use\nof language, and the law that is made. It is the view that if an\nagency or a person is authorised to make law, it makes the law that it\ncommunicates by its use of\n language.[3]\n That \u2018communication model\u2019 must be qualified in at least\nfour ways, because the law itself regulates the making of law:\n\nthe law that is made will be limited by any legal limit on the\npower of the law maker (as to the substance of the law that it can\nmake, or as to the process by which it can lawfully make law),\nand\nrules of law may qualify the law that is made in a variety of ways\nthat are not susceptible of any general\n characterisation[4]\n (see Solum 2013 for an extensive discussion of ways in which the law\nthat is made by a communicative act may be qualified), and\ncourts may need to resolve indeterminacies in the effect of an act\nof law making, and where they do so, their decisions may have\nconclusive legal effect (for the parties, and also for the future if\nthe decision is treated as a precedent), and\nif a court departs from the law that the law maker communicated\n(for good reasons or bad), the decision of the court may still have\nconclusive legal effect (for the parties, and also for the future if\nthe decision is treated as a precedent).\n\n\nEven with those qualifications, some theorists reject the\ncommunication model. They argue that the identification of legal\nrights and duties cannot be based merely on facts such as the fact\nthat an authority has communicated this or that. This section will\naddress theories that seek to ground the law on something more\ndignified than mere words. And we will have to ask whether those\ntheories can account for the diverse normative powers that legal\nsystems confer on institutions and agencies and persons.\n",
