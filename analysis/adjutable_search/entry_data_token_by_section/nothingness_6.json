    "main_text": "The subtraction argument\n7. The subtraction argument\n\nThomas Baldwin (1996) reinforces the possibility of an empty world by\nrefining the following thought experiment: Imagine a world in which\nthere are only finitely many objects. Suppose each object vanishes in\nsequence. Eventually you run down to three objects, two objects, one\nobject and then Poof! There\u2019s your empty world.\n\nWhat can be done temporally can be done modally. There is only a small\ndifference between a possible world with a hundred objects and a\npossible world with just ninety-nine, and from there \u2026. well,\njust do the arithmetic!\n\nCan the subtraction be completed if there necessarily are infinitely\nmany things? Penelope Maddy (1990) claims that unit sets are concrete\nentities, sharing the location of their members. The existence of one\nconcrete entity would guarantee the existence of infinitely many.\nConsequently, there would be no finite worlds.\n\nBaldwin avoids this issue with a different definition. Concrete\nentities are violators of Leibniz\u2019s principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. Concrete things may have exact duplicates. For\ninstance, Cameron Winklevoss could have a twin who perfectly\nresembles him (unlike his homozygotic twin Tyler Winklevoss). In\ncontrast, the unit set comprised of Cameron Winklevoss cannot have a\nperfect twin. All sets obey Leibniz\u2019s principle of the identity\nof indiscernibles and so Baldwin counts sets as abstract entities.\n\nGeraldine Coggins (2010, chapter 4) objects that Baldwin\u2019s\ndefinition of concreteness is inferior to the customary spatiotemporal\ndefinition. She deems the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic\nproperties as too problematic to ground the distinction between\nconcrete and abstract objects.\n\nAnother concern is that infinite proliferation can be precipitated by\nthe constitution relation. Assume that each part of a concrete entity\nis itself concrete. Also assume that concrete entities are infinitely\ndivisible (as seems natural given that space is dense). An infinitely\ncomplex object cannot be nibbled away with any number of finite\nbites.\n\nGonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra (2013) suggests that we instead take big,\ninfinite bites. Instead of subtracting entity by entity, subtract by\nthe chunk (of infinitely composite entities).\n\nOur metaphysical calculations are subliminally influenced by how we\npicture possible worlds (Coggins 2010, chapter 3). If possible worlds\nare envisaged as containers, then they can be completely emptied.\nSimilarly, if possible worlds are pictured as stories (say maximally\nconsistent ways things could have been), then our library will contain\na tale lacking any concrete entities as characters. But if possible\nworlds are pictured mereologically, as giant conglomerates of concrete\nobjects (Lewis 1986), our subtraction falters before we reach zero.\nSimilarly, if possible worlds require an active construction (say,\nimaginary rearrangements of objects drawn from the actual world), then\nthe very process of construction ensures that there are some concrete\nobjects in every possible world.\n\nSome kind of background theory of possible worlds is needed. For\nwithout this substantive guidance, the subtraction argument seems\ninvalid. More specifically, from a metaphysically neutral perspective,\nthe fact that it is possible for each object to not exist seems\ncompatible with it being necessary that at least one object\nexists.\n\nThe founder of modal logic, Aristotle, has special reason to deny that\n\u2018Necessarily (p or q)\u2019 entails\n\u2018Necessarily p or necessarily q\u2019.\nAristotle believed that all abstract entities depend on concrete\nentities for their existence. Yet he also believed that there are\nnecessary truths. The existence of any particular individual is\ncontingent but it is necessary that some individuals exist.\n\nScience textbooks teem with contingent abstract entities: the equator,\nJupiter\u2019s center of gravity, the European Space Agency\u2019s\nbudget, etc. Twentieth century mathematics made sets central. Sets are\ndefined in terms of their members. Therefore, any set that contains a\ncontingent entity is itself a contingent entity. Any set that contains\nCameron Winklevoss is an abstract entity that has no weight or color\nor electric charge. But it still depends on Cameron Winklevoss for its\nexistence.\n\nMathematics can be reconstructed in terms of sets given the assumption\nthat something exists. From Cameron Winklevoss, set theorists can\nderive the set containing him, then the set containing that set, then\nthe set containing that larger set, and so on. Through arachnophilic\ncraftiness, all of mathematics can be reconstructed from sets. But\nfounding all of mathematics on Cameron Winklevoss would fail to\nreflect the necessary status of mathematical truth. Founding\nmathematics on a necessary being such as God would alienate atheists.\nSo ecumenical set theorists instead spin this amazing structure from\nonly the set that does not depend on the existence of anything: the\nempty set. This is the closest mathematicians get to creation from\nnothing!\n\nThis does not avoid all controversy. Early set theorists and an array\nof contemporary metaphysicians reject the empty set. Yet the\nloveliness of the construction makes many of their colleagues\nreceptive to Wesley Salmon\u2019s ontological argument: \u201cThe\nfool saith in his heart that there is no empty set. But if that were\nso, then the set of all such sets would be empty, and hence\nit would be the empty set.\u201d (Gardner 1977, 32).\n\nE. J. Lowe (2013, 192) argues on behalf of the fool: Two sets are\nidentical exactly if they have the same members. So the identity of a\nset is grounded on the identity conditions of its members. In the\nabsence of members, the set is ill-defined. Mathematicians may wield\nit as a useful fiction. But utility should not be confused with truth.\nSince mathematical statements such as \u2018The first prime number\nafter 1,000,000 is 1,000,003\u2019 are necessary truths and can only\nbe rendered true by the existence of a contingent being, such as\nCameron Winklevoss, Lowe concludes that there necessarily exists at\nleast one contingent being. Consequently, the empty world is\nimpossible even if there are no necessary beings.\n\nThere are other metaphysical systems that make the existence of some\nconcrete entities necessary without implying that there are any\nnecessarily existing concrete things. In his Tractatus phase,\nLudwig Wittgenstein takes a world to be a totality of facts. A fact\nconsists of one or more objects related to each other in a certain\nway. By an act of selective attention, we concentrate on just the\nobjects or just the relations. But objects and relations are always\ninextricably bound up with each other. Since every fact requires at\nleast one object, a world without objects would be a world without\nfacts. But a factless world is a contradiction in terms. Therefore,\nthe empty world is impossible.\n\nNevertheless, the persuasiveness of the subtraction argument is not\nentirely hostage to background theories about the nature of possible\nworlds. Even those with metaphysical systems that guarantee the\nexistence of some concrete entities feel pressure to revise those\nsystems to accommodate the empty world, or at least to look for some\nloophole that would make their system compatible with Baldwin\u2019s\nthought experiment.\n\nConsider the combinatorialist David Armstrong. He eventually\nacquiesced to the empty world by relaxing his account of truthmakers.\nA truthmaker is a piece of reality that makes a statement true.\nArmstrong believes that every contingent truth is made true by a\ntruthmaker and has wielded the principle forcefully against analytical\nbehaviorists, phenomenalists, nominalists, and presentists. Since\nthere can be no truthmaker for an empty world, Armstrong appears to\nhave a second objection to the empty world (supplementing the\nobjection based on his combinatorial conception of a possible world).\nYet Armstrong (2004, 91) instead claims that the empty world could\nborrow truthmakers from the actual world. His idea is that the\ntruthmakers for possibilities are actual objects and that these actual\nobjects could serve as the truthmakers for the empty world. David\nEfird and Tom Stoneham (2009) object that cross-world truthmakers\nwould be equally handy to the analytical behaviorists, phenomenalists\nand their ilk. Whether or not Armstrong has contradicted himself, he\nhas illustrated the persuasiveness of the subtraction argument.\n",
