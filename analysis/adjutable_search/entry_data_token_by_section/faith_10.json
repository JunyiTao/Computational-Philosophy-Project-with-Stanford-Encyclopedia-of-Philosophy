    "main_text": "Faith as a virtue\n11. Faith beyond (orthodox) theism\n\nWhat is the potential scope of faith? On some models, the kind of\nfaith exemplified by theistic faith is found only there. On models\nwhich take faith to consist in knowledge or belief, faith is\nintrinsically linked to theological content\u2014indeed, in the case\nof Christian faith, to orthodox Christian theological\ncontent, specifiable as one unified set of doctrines conveyed to\nreceptive human minds by the operation of divine grace. The venture\nmodels, however, allow for the possibility that authentic faith may be\nvariously realised, and be directed upon different, and mutually\nincompatible, intentional objects. This pluralism is an important\nfeature of accounts of faith in the American pragmatist tradition.\nJohn Dewey strongly rejected the notion of faith as a special kind of\nknowledge (Dewey 1934, 20), as did William James, whose\n\u2018justification of faith\u2019 rests on a\npermissibility thesis, under which varied and conflicting\nfaith-commitments may equally have a place in the \u2018intellectual\nrepublic\u2019 (James 1896 [1956, 30]). Charles S. Peirce, another\ninfluential American pragmatist, arguably held a non-doxastic view of\nfaith (Pope 2018).\n\nBoth Dewey and James defend models of faith with a view to advancing\nthe idea that authentic religious faith may be found outside what is\ngenerally supposed to be theological orthodoxy. Furthermore, they\nsuggest that \u2018un-orthodox\u2019 faith may be more\nauthentic than \u2018orthodox\u2019 faith. \u2018The faith that is\nreligious\u2019, says Dewey, \u2018[I should describe as] the\nunification of the self through allegiance to inclusive ideal ends,\nwhich imagination presents to us and to which the human will responds\nas worthy of controlling our desires and choices\u2019 (1934, 33).\nAnd James: \u2018Religion says essentially two things: First, she\nsays that the best things are the more eternal things, the overlapping\nthings, the things in the universe that throw the last stone, so to\nspeak, and say the final word. ... [and] the second affirmation of\nreligion is that we are better off now if we believe her first\naffirmation to be true\u2019 (James 1896 [1956, 25\u20136]). While\nsome of what Dewey and James say about justifiable faith may appear\nnon-realist, in fact they both preserve the idea that religious faith\naspires to grasp, beyond the evidence, vital truth about reality. For\nexample, Dewey holds that religious belief grounds hope because it\ntakes something to be true about the real world \u2018which carr[ies]\none through periods of darkness and despair to such an extent that\nthey lose their usual depressive character\u2019 (1934,\n14\u20135).\n\nA general\u2014i.e., non-theologically specific\u2014account of the\nreligious kind of faith may have potential as a tool for criticising\nspecific philosophical formulations of the content of religious faith.\nThe conditions for permissible faith-venture may exclude\nfaith in God under certain inadequate conceptions of who or what God\nis. Arguably, the \u2018personal omniGod\u2019 of much contemporary\nphilosophy of religion is just such an inadequate conception (Bishop\n2007b). An understanding of what faith is, then, may motivate radical\nexplorations into the concept of God as held in the theistic\ntraditions (Bishop 1998; Johnston 2009; Bishop and Perszyk 2014,\n2023).\n\nCan there be faith of the same general kind as found in theistic\nreligious faith yet without adherence to any theistic tradition? Those\nwho agree with F. R. Tennant that \u2018faith is an outcome of the\ninborn propensity to self-conservation and self-betterment which is a\npart of human nature, and is no more a miraculously superadded\nendowment than is sensation or understanding\u2019 (1943 [1989, 111])\nwill consider that this must be a possibility. Tennant himself\nsuggests that \u2018much of the belief which underlies\nknowledge\u2019\u2014and he has scientific knowledge in\nmind\u2014\u2018is the outcome of faith which ventures beyond the\napprehension and treatment of data to supposition, imagination and\ncreation of ideal objects, and justifies its audacity and\nirrationality (in accounting them to be also real) by practical\nactualization\u2019 (1943 [1989, 100]). Faith in this sense, however,\nmay not seem quite on a par with faith of the religious kind. True,\nscientists must act as if their \u2018ideal objects\u2019\nare real in putting their theories to the empirical test; but they\nwill \u2018account them to be also real\u2019 only when these tests\ndo provide confirmation in accordance with the applicable\ninter-subjective norms.\n\nIf faith is understood as commitment beyond independent\ninter-subjective evidential support to the truth of some overall\ninterpretation of experience and reality, then all who commit\nthemselves (with sufficient steadfastness) to such a\nWeltanschauung or worldview will be people of faith. Faith of\nthis kind may be religious, and it may be religious without being\ntheistic, of course, as in classical Buddhism or Taoism. Some have\nargued that faith is a human universal: Cantwell Smith, for example,\ndescribes it as \u2018a planetary human characteristic [involving\nthe] capacity to perceive, to symbolize, and live loyally and richly\nin terms of, a transcendent dimension to [human] life\u2019 (1979,\n140\u2013141). There may also, arguably, be non-religious faith: for\nexample, \u2018scientific atheists\u2019 or\n\u2018naturalists\u2019 may be making a faith-venture when they take\nthere to be no more to reality than is in principle discoverable by\nthe natural sciences. The suggestion that atheism rests on a\nfaith-venture will, however, be resisted by those who maintain\n\u2018the presumption of atheism\u2019 (Flew, 1976): if atheism is\nrationally the default position, then adopting it requires no\nventure.\n\nAn atheist\u2019s faith-venture may, in any case, seem oddly so\ndescribed on the grounds that it provides no basis for practical hope\nor trust. Providing such a basis may plausibly be thought necessary\nfor faith\u2014the truth to which the venturer commits must be\nexistentially important in this way. (Note James\u2019s requirement\nthat faith-commitment is permissible only for resolving a\n\u2018genuine option\u2019, where a genuine option has inter\nalia to be \u2018momentous\u2019, that is, existentially\nsignificant and pressing (James 1896 [1956, 3\u20134]).) Truth-claims\naccepted by faith of the religious kind seem essentially to be\n\u2018saving\u2019 truths\u2014solutions to deep problems about the\nhuman situation. And there may thus be arguments as to which religious\ntradition offers the best solutions to human problems (see, for\nexample, Yandell 1990, 1999). J. L. Schellenberg (2009) argues that\nthe only kind of religious faith that could be justified (if any is)\nis a sceptical \u2018ultimism\u2019, in which one\n\u2018assents\u2019 to and treats as real an imaginatively grasped\nconception of a metaphysically, axiologically and soteriologically\nultimate reality.\n\nSome may nevertheless argue that an existentially vital faith that\ngrounds hope can belong within a wholly secular context\u2014that is,\nwithout counting in any recognisable sense as \u2018religious\u2019.\nCantwell Smith claims, for example, that \u2018the Graeco-Roman\nheritage \u2026 and its fecundating role in Western life [can] be\nseen as one of the major spiritual traditions of our world\u2019\n(1979, 139). Annette Baier suggests that \u2018the secular equivalent\nof faith in God, which we need in morality as well as in science or\nknowledge acquisition, is faith in the human community and its\nevolving procedures \u2013 in the prospects for many-handed cognitive\nambitions and moral hopes\u2019 (Baier 1980, 133). More broadly, some\nmaintain that a meaningful spirituality is consistent with a\nnon-religious atheist naturalism, and include something akin to faith\nas essential to spirituality. For example, Robert Solomon takes\nspirituality to mean \u2018the grand and thoughtful passions of\nlife\u2019, and holds that \u2018a life lived in accordance with\nthose passions\u2019 entails choosing to see the world as\n\u2018benign and life [as] meaningful\u2019, with the tragic not to\nbe denied but accepted (Solomon 2002, 6 & 51). (For further\ndiscussion of faith in secular contexts, see Preston-Roedder 2018,\nTsai 2017, and Ichikawa 2020; for special journal issues addressing a\nvariety of issues in the philosophy of faith in both religious and\nsecular contexts, see Rice et al. 2017; Malcolm 2023; McKaughan and\nHoward-Snyder 2023b.)\n",
