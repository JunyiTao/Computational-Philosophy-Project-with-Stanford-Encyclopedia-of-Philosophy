Varieties of Modality and the Target of the Epistemology of Modality\n\nThe broad focus of the epistemology of modality is the so-called\n\u201calethic\u201d or \u201cobjective\u201d modalities. These are\nusually identified with those modalities that respect the T axiom of\nmodal logic, \\(\\Box p \\rightarrow p\\) (if a proposition is necessary,\nthen it is true, where the box stands for necessity). Non-alethic\nmodalities, such as deontic modality (which has to do with obligations\nand permissions, namely what is obligatory for one to do and\nwhat one is permitted to do, according to, e.g., the moral\nnorms, or the law), do not obey the T axiom, since, e.g., even if one\nis obligated to do \\(p\\), they might not do \\(p\\). Although epistemic\nmodalities do respect the T axiom (if one knows that \\(p\\), then \\(p\\)\nis true) they are usually ruled out \u201cby hand\u201d, so to\nspeak, qua non-alethic and non-objective, since they are\nthought to be dependent on the epistemic subject.\n\nAmong the alethic (or objective) modalities we find logical, physical,\nand metaphysical modality. Where \\(p\\) is a proposition,\nlogical and physical modality are standardly defined\nas follows:\n\n\\(p\\) is logically possible iff \\(p\\) is consistent with\nthe laws of logic.\n\\(p\\) is logically necessary iff \\(p\\) follows from the\nlaws of logic.\n\\(p\\) is physically possible iff \\(p\\) is consistent with\nthe laws of nature.\n\\(p\\) is physically necessary iff \\(p\\) follows from the\nlaws of nature.\n\n\nIt is more controversial how one should define metaphysical\nmodality. The traditional approach appeals to alternative ways the\nworld might have been, called\n \u201cpossible worlds\u201d.\n\n\\(p\\) is metaphysically possible iff \\(p\\) is true in at\nleast one possible world.\n\\(p\\) is metaphysically necessary iff \\(p\\) is true in\nall possible worlds.\n\n\nAlternatively, philosophers have defined metaphysical modality in\nterms of laws of metaphysics (see, e.g., Kment 2014, 2021;\nfor discussion: Wilsch 2015, 2020).\n\n\\(p\\) is metaphysically possible iff \\(p\\) is consistent\nwith the laws of metaphysics.\n\\(p\\) is metaphysically necessary iff \\(p\\) follows from\nthe laws of metaphysics.\n\n\nIn addition, metaphysical modality has often been characterized as the\nwidest, strongest, most unrestricted, or\nabsolute modality (e.g., Kripke 1980; Lewis 1986; Stalnaker\n2003; van Inwagen 1998; Hale 2013; Williamson 2016). While these are\nmetaphorical labels (and recently the target of several criticisms,\ne.g., Clarke-Doane 2019a, 2019b; Mallozzi forthcoming a), the core\nidea is that metaphysical modality is not restricted by the laws of\nnature and is more substantive than logical-conceptual modality. As\nsuch, it is plausibly the modality of philosophical thinking par\nexcellence.\n\nA helpful diagram to understand the relationship between the three\nmain alethic modalities, namely logical, physical, and metaphysical\nmodality, is the nesting model. The model depicts a nesting relation\namong those modalities, such that what is physically possible is also\nmetaphysically possible, and what is metaphysically possible is also\nlogically possible (see fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFig. 1: Nesting model for\npossibility.\n\n\nConversely, what is logically necessary is metaphysically necessary,\nand what is metaphysically necessary is also physically necessary.\nOther kinds of modality can be suitably added to the model, as well,\nsuch as practical possibility. Practical possibilities would be within\nthe physical possibilities. Importantly, some philosophers question\nwhether metaphysical modality is a distinct and irreducible modality.\nAlternative accounts include inflationism, deflationism, and\nskepticism. Inflationists, such as David Chalmers (2002),\nhold \u201cModal Monism\u201d, the view that there is only one modal\nnotion or primitive, such that metaphysical and logical modality\ncoincide (more below,\n \u00a74.1).\n Deflationists, such as Sydney Shoemaker (1998), argue that\nmetaphysical modality coincides with physical modality. Skeptics, such\nas Graham Priest (2021), question whether there is a notion of\nmetaphysical necessity that is distinct from both, analytic\nnecessity (which corresponds to conceptual necessity) and\nphysical necessity.\n\nMetaphysical modality is the modality that is typically at\nstake in philosophical argumentation (e.g.,\n St. Anselm\u2019s Ontological Argument,\n Rene Descartes\u2019 Argument for Mind-Body Dualism,\n George Berkeley\u2019s Argument for Idealism).\n Accordingly, the Access Question in the epistemology of modality\nfocuses on how we can access metaphysical modality. Besides\ninvestigating the modal status of philosophical propositions, modal\nepistemologists are also interested in answering common every-day\nmodal questions, such as, could the couch be on the other side of\nthe room? Can Mary climb the tree? Can the cup fit in the\ndrawer?\n\nSome philosophers have recently approached the epistemology of\nmetaphysical modality by first investigating whether some every-day\npropositions are practically possible (as opposed to\nmetaphysically possible) (e.g., Strohminger 2015 and Vetter\nforthcoming). Whether some proposition \\(p\\) is practically\npossible hinges on some specific circumstances that are held\nfixed in a situation\u2014for example, given a particular\nsubject\u2019s physical abilities, or certain environmental\nconditions. While it seems uncontroversial that it is metaphysically\npossible to get the couch to the other side of the room, a specific\nsubject might wonder whether it is practically possible for her to do\nso, given certain circumstances.\n\nThis raises a Navigation Question: How are we to epistemically\nnavigate from practical modality to metaphysical modality? Given that\nwe know that \\(p\\) is practically possible, how do we come to know\nthat it is metaphysically possible? Is this done via some (implicit or\nexplicit) inferential transition? If so, does that imply that we need\nknowledge of some bridge principle between practical and metaphysical\npossibility?\n\nHere it is useful to see the contrast between the Access Question and\nthe Navigation Question again. While the former asks how we initially\nget epistemic access to the modal realm without relying on modal\npremises, the latter asks about how we epistemically navigate from one\n\u201csphere\u201d or kind of modality to another. We will see that\nwhile the Access Question has traditionally been the main focus in the\nliterature, some recent accounts (like, e.g., Strohminger\u2019s\n(2015), Vetter\u2019s (forthcoming), and, in a sense, Chalmers\u2019\n(2002)) a Navigation Question takes center stage.\n",
