The Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC)\n\nThe educational movement known as Philosophy for Children got its\nstart in the early 1970s with the publication of Matthew\nLipman\u2019s philosophical novel for children, Harry\nStottlemeier\u2019s Discovery. In 1970 Harry made its\nentry into the Montclair Public Schools in New Jersey. By the mid-70s\nthe Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC)\nwas formally in place at Montclair State College (now Montclair State\nUniversity). The media quickly picked up on reports of significant\nimprovements in the reading and critical thinking skills of middle\nschool children who were involved in IAPC programs. Subsequently, IAPC\nproduced materials consisting of Lipman\u2019s children\u2019s\nnovels and, under the leadership of IAPC colleague Ann Margaret Sharp,\naccompanying teacher workbooks for the entire K-12 curriculum.\nThousands of children in New Jersey, across the United States, and\neven around the world have subsequently been introduced to IAPC\neducational programs.\n\nAn unassuming 96 page novel for middle-school children, Lipman\u2019s\nfirst novel, Harry Stottlemeier\u2019s Discovery, features\nHarry and his 5th grade classmates. Adults occasionally\nenter in, but the primary philosophical work is done by the children.\nHarry and his friends discover several basic concepts and rules of\nAristotelean logic; and they puzzle over questions about the nature of\nthought, mind, causality, reality, knowledge and belief, right and\nwrong, and fairness and unfairness. \n\n\u201cWhat is Harry Stottlemeier\u2019s discovery?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s readers might ask. This question is not\ndirectly answered. However, one candidate stands out among the many\nthings that Harry discovers in the course of exploring questions about\nlogic, knowledge, reality, and the mind. Harry and his classmates are\nasked to write a paper on the topic, \u201cThe Most Interesting Thing\nin the World.\u201d Entitled Thinking, Harry\u2019s essay\nbegins:\n\nTo me, the most interesting thing in the whole world is thinking. I\nknow that lots of other things are also very important and wonderful,\nlike electricity, and magnetism and gravitation. But although we\nunderstand them, they can\u2019t understand us. So thinking must be\nsomething very special.\n\n\nAfter writing several more paragraphs, Harry puts his paper aside.\nLater he thinks, \u201cIn school, we think about math, and we think\nabout spelling, and we think about grammar. But who every heard of\nthinking about thinking?\u201d So, he adds one more sentence to his\npaper: \u201cIf we think about electricity, we can understand it\nbetter, but when we think about thinking, we seem to understand\nourselves better.\u201d\n\nWithout using the word \u2018philosophy,\u2019 either here or\nanywhere else in Harry, Lipman shows Harry engaged in serious\nphilosophical thought, \u201cthinking about thinking.\u201d This, we\nmight say, reveals Harry\u2019s discovery of the joys of\nphilosophical thinking. But there is more. Harry also notices that, as\ninteresting and important as thinking about thinking is, it seems to\nhave no special place in school. Finally, although his paper begins in\nthe first person, it quickly moves to \u2018we\u2019 and focuses on\nwhat might be accomplished with others in the classroom.\n\nOne of the more attractive features of the IAPC approach to Philosophy\nfor Children for many teachers has been that it promotes the idea of\nthe classroom as a \u201ccommunity of inquiry\u201d in which\nstudents openly and respectfully exchange ideas. Each student is\nregarded as having the potential to make valuable contributions to the\ntopics under consideration. Students are encouraged to develop good\nlistening skills, responsiveness to what others say, willingness to\ntry to support one\u2019s own ideas with good reasons, and openness\nto the possibility that one should modify one\u2019s beliefs in light\nof new considerations. In short, the classroom is designed to\nreinforce the student\u2019s potential for reasonableness.\nThis involves more than being able to engage in skillful reasoning. As\nLaurance J. Splitter and Ann Margaret Sharp put it (Splitter and\nSharp, p. 6):\n\nReasonableness is primarily a social disposition: the reasonable\nperson respects others and is prepared to take into account their\nviews and their feelings, to the extent of changing her own mind about\nissues of significance, and consciously allowing her own perspective\nto be changed by others. She is, in other words, willing to be\nreasoned with.\n\n\nTeachers who look favorably on the idea that the classroom should be a\n\u201ccommunity of inquiry\u201d nevertheless may resist the idea\nthat philosophy should be the centerpiece for discussion.\nOther subjects, they might contend, lend themselves well to forming\nthe sort of collaborative learning environment that can fairly be\ncalled a \u201ccommunity of inquiry.\u201d Philosophy for Children\nadvocates, however, need only insist that the sort of inquiry they are\nsupporting be philosophical, rather than being simply shared.\nUnfortunately, Ann Margaret Sharp passed away in 2011. The\ndistinctiveness of the sort of inquiry she and Lipman advocated is\nexplored in some detail in a recent collection of essays by and about\nher that is dedicated to her memory, In Community of Inquiry with\nAnn Margaret Sharp: Philosophy, Childhood and Education (Gregory\nand Laverty, 2017). [This is the first book in Routledge\u2019s\nPhilosophy for Children Founders series of volumes to be edited by\nMaughn Rollins Gregory and Megan Jane Laverty. The second volume is\nGareth Matthews, The Child\u2019s Philosopher, 2022, with\nseveral other books in this series forthcoming.]\n\nIt may be thought that philosophy is, at best, a suitable subject for\nrelatively few students at the pre-college level. Since philosophy\ntraditionally has been taught only at the college level in the United\nStates, it might be thought that it can be suitable for only a small\nsegment of students at pre-college levels\u2014the two percent of\nstudents who are classified as \u201cgifted and talented.\u201d\nHowever, Philosophy for Children programs have shown themselves to be\nremarkably successful in drawing virtually all students in the\nclassroom together in inquiry. Teachers are often surprised, and\npleased, to see many of their most reticent,\n\u201cunderachieving\u201d students actively join in the discussion\nof philosophical ideas.\n\nNevertheless, because they lack background in the formal study of\nphilosophy, many teachers are reluctant to encourage the philosophical\nthinking of their students. Their fears, however, are exaggerated.\nFamiliarity with some of the standard philosophical literature might\nbe desirable, but it is not necessary for bringing Philosophy for\nChildren into the classroom. What is required is the ability to\nfacilitate philosophical discussion. For this, it is much more\nimportant that teachers have some philosophical curiosity themselves\nthan a familiarity with academic philosophical literature. Like their\nstudents, teachers unfamiliar with the discipline of philosophy may\nnevertheless have an aptitude for philosophical thinking\u2014or at\nleast a knack for recognizing when others are engaged in philosophical\nthought.\n\nFacilitating a Philosophy for Children discussion does not mean\ndominating it; it is important for teachers to allow their students to\ndevelop their own ideas. Teachers are not expected to provide, or even\nhave, answers to all the questions. They can share puzzlement with\ntheir students, be open to unexpected but suggestive responses to the\nquestions they and their students pose, and take pleasure in observing\nthe exchanges students have with each other. This means shedding the\ntraditional role of teacher as lecturer and answer-giver. Especially\nfor teachers who are uncertain about what this entails, workshops like\nthose offered by IAPC provide a good introduction to the pedagogy of\nPhilosophy for Children. However, there is a growing number of\norganizations around the world (some of which are mentioned below)\nalso providing assistance for teachers.\n",
