    "main_text": "Objections Against Retrocausality in Quantum Mechanics || Retrocausality Just Is Superdeterminism\n7.2 Retrocausality Just Is Superdeterminism\n\nRecall\n (\u00a73.1)\n that retrocausality can be motivated as an explicit violation of the\nassumption of measurement independence (Eq. (\\ref{eq:independence}))\nas a means of circumventing Bell\u2019s theorem. But there is another\npossible mechanism that might underpin violations of measurement\nindependence, namely, superdeterminism. This is the idea that, in the\nterminology of\n \u00a73,\n the joint past of (i) the measurement setting \\(\\alpha\\) and (ii) the\nhidden state of the measured system \\(\\lambda\\) determines both of\nthem completely and induces the relevant quantum correlations between\nthem (see the entry on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem,\n \u00a78.1.1, and references therein). Hossenfelder (2020) argues\nagainst referring to violations of measurement independence as\n\u2018retrocausality\u2019, preferring to consider such violations\nas exclusively instances of \u2018superdeterminism\u2019, since\n\u201cthe idea of a cause propagating back in time is\nmeaningless\u201d (2020:10; see also Hossenfelder and Palmer (2020)).\nThe essential point of contention here, and Hossenfelder points this\nout explicitly, is that each of retrocausality and superdeterminism\ninvokes a different understanding of the nature of causality.\n\nThe characterisation of causality that Hossenfelder (2020: 10) takes\nto undermine the proposal of retrocausality is that A is a\ncause of B if and only if A and B are correlated\nand B is in the forward lightcone of A: \u201cIf you\nthink you have a situation where B \u201dretrocauses\u201c A,\nthen this merely means A causes B\u201d. In this way,\nsuch correlations between events should never be understood as\nretrocausal, and should always be understood as superdeterministic.\nThis characterization of causality is reminiscent of Hume\u2019s\nconventionalism about cause and effect, according to which it is\nsimply a matter of terminology that causes must precede their effects\n(see the entry on\n Backward Causation,\n \u00a72.3). As noted in the metaphysical preliminaries set out in\n \u00a72.1,\n the conception of causality that most naturally coheres with the\nproposal of retrocausality is an interventionist one. Hossenfelder\nacknowledges this, and argues that the reason the interventionist\naccount of causation is inappropriate as a proposal in the quantum\ncontext \u201cis that \u201dagents\u201c and their\n\u201dinterventions\u201c are macroscopic terms that do not appear\nin quantum mechanics\u201d.\n\nWhat Hossenfelder\u2019s critique emphasizes is that retrocausality\nrequires a certain package of metaphysical views to be a viable\nproposal. Hossenfelder\u2019s analysis relies on a conception of\ncausality that is at odds with the interventionist account, especially\nas understood along perspectival lines, as outlined in\n \u00a72.1.\n As a result, a defence of retrocausality against Hossenfelder\u2019s\nobjection would need to defend the fruitfulness of this account of\ncausality.\n",
