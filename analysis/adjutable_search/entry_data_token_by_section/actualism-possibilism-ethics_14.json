Securitist Views\n\nRecall that the kinds of actualist-possibilist scenarios that we have\nbeen discussing\u2014the cases of Professor Procrastinate\nand the case of Jones\u2014are diachronic cases in the sense\nthat they concern different acts that are performed across different\nmoments of time, rather than at the same time. For example, in the\ncase of Professor Procrastinate, one of the relevant\ncounterfactuals is that if she were to \u27e8agree to review the\npaper\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\), then she would \u27e8not write the\nreview\u27e9 at \\(t_2\\). The act in the antecedent and the act in\nthe consequent are indexed to different times. On the surface, it may\nappear that a diachronic case would yield the same results as a\nsynchronic case, i.e., a case that involves the performance of\ndifferent acts at the same time. But as Goldman (1978) shows, a\nsynchronic actualist-possibilist scenario yields new difficulties for\nactualism, including Goldman\u2019s (1976)\n (G*1),\n and the way to address these difficulties is by incorporating a\ncontrol condition over the truth-value of certain counterfactuals.\n",
