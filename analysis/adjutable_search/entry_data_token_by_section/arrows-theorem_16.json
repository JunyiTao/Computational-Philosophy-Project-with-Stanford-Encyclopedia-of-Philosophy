    "main_text": "Possibilities || More Ordinal Information\n5.2 More Ordinal Information\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives severely limits\nwhich information about individual preferences may be used for\nwhat. It requires a social welfare function, when assembling the\nsocial preference among a pair of alternatives, to take into account\nonly those of people\u2019s preferences that concern just this pair. This\nSection discusses two kinds of information that is implicit in\npreferences for other alternatives, and illustrates their use in social\ndecision making: information about the positions of alternatives in\nindividual orderings, and information about the fairness of social\nstates. \nPositional voting methods take into account where the\ncandidates come in the different individual orderings\u2014whether it\nis first, or second, \u2026 or last. Borda counting is an\nimportant example. Named after Jean-Charles de Borda, a contemporary\nof Condorcet, it had already been proposed in the 13th\nCentury by the pioneering writer and social theorist Ramon\nLull. Nicholas of Cusa in the 15th Century recommended it\nfor electing Holy Roman Emperors. Borda counting is used in some\npolitical elections and on many other occasions for voting, in clubs\nand other organizations.  Consider the profile:\n\nABCD\nBACD\nBACD\n\nLet each candidate receive four points for coming first in some\nvoter\u2019s ordering, three for coming second, two for a third place and a\nsingle point for coming last; the alternatives then are ordered by the\ntotal number of points they receive, from all the voters. The Borda\ncount of \\(A\\) is then 10 (or \\(4+3+3\\)) and that of \\(B\\) is 11 \\((3+4+4)\\),\nso \\(B\\) outranks \\(A\\) in the social ordering. This method\napplies with the obvious adaptation to any election with a finite\nnumber of candidates.\nNow suppose voter \\(1\\) moves \\(B\\) from second place to last on his\nown list, and we have the profile:\n\nACDB\nBACD\nBACD\n\nThen \\(B\\) will receive just 9 points \\((1+4+4)\\). \\(A\\) receives\nthe same 10 as before, though, and now outranks \\(B\\). This example\nillustrates two important points.  First, Borda counting does not\nsatisfy Arrow\u2019s condition I, since while each voter\u2019s ranking\nof \\(A\\) with respect to \\(B\\) is the same in the two profiles, the\nsocial ordering of this pair is different. Second, Borda counting\nprovides opportunities for voters to manipulate the outcome of an\nelection by strategic voting. If everybody\u2019s preferences are as in the\nfirst profile, voter \\(1\\) might do well to misrepresent his\npreferences by putting \\(B\\) at the bottom of his list. In this way,\nhe can promote his own favorite, \\(A\\), to the top of the social\nordering (he will get away with this, of course, only if the other\nvoters do not see what he is up to and adjust their own rankings\naccordingly, by putting his favorite \\(A\\) at the bottom). The\nsusceptibility of Borda counting to strategic voting has long been\nknown. When this was raised as an objection, Borda\u2019s indignant\nresponse is said to have been that his scheme was intended for honest\npeople. Lull and Nicholas of Cusa recommended, before voting by this\nmethod, earnest oaths to tell the truth and stripping oneself of all\nsins.\n\nFor further discussion of positionalist voting methods, see the\nentries voting methods\nand social choice theory; for an\nanalytical overview, see Pattanaik\u2019s (2002) handbook article. Barber\u00e0\n(2010) reviews what is known about strategic voting. \nMark Fleurbaey (2007) has shown that social welfare functions need\nmore ordinal information than I allows them if they are to\nrespond appropriately to a certain fairness of social states. He gives\nthe example of Ann, who has ten apples and two oranges, and Bob, with\nthree apples and eleven oranges. This allocation is said to be\n\u201cenvy free\u201d if, intuitively, she is at least as happy with\nher own basket of fruit as she would be with his and, similarly, he is\nas happy with his own basket as he would be with hers. Let the\ndistribution of fruit in one social state \\(S\\) be as described, and\nconsider the state \\(S^*\\) in which the allocations are reversed. That\nis, in \\(S^*\\) it is Ann that has three apples and eleven oranges,\nwhile Bob has ten apples and two oranges. More technically, \\(S\\)\nis envy free if Ann weakly prefers \\(S\\) to \\(S^*\\), and Bob\ndoes too. We might expect that, other things being equal, the envy\nfreeness of a social state will promote it in the social ordering\nabove an alternative state that is not envy free. But I does\nnot allow this.\n\nTo see why not, consider whether it would be socially preferable,\nstarting from the status quo \\(S\\), to take one apple and one orange\nfrom Bob and give both of them to Ann. Let \\(T\\) be the state arising\nfrom this transfer. We assume for the sake of the example that Ann\nalways strictly prefers having more of everything for herself to\nhaving less, and that Bob\u2019s preferences are similarly self-interested,\nso that in all admissible profiles Ann strictly prefers \\(T\\) to\n\\(S\\), while Bob strictly prefers \\(S\\) to \\(T\\). Their preferences\namong these states are opposite and do not by themselves entail a\nsocial preference one way or the other. Now, consider first a profile\nin which the status quo \\(S\\) is envy free but \\(T\\) is not. (Let both\nAnn and Bob be indifferent between the baskets each one has in \\(S\\)\nbut not between those in \\(T\\), in which both agree that Bob is worse\noff.) Relative to this profile, a social welfare function promoting\nenvy freeness comes out against the transfer from Bob to Ann by\nranking \\(S\\) strictly above \\(T\\). But consider another profile, in\nwhich it is \\(T\\) that is envy free (now Ann and Bob are indifferent\nbetween the baskets in \\(T\\), and agree that in \\(S\\) Ann is worse off\nthan Bob). Relative to this second profile, \\(T\\) outranks \\(S\\) in\nthe social ordering. In direct conflict with I, the social\npreference among \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) switches as we go from one profile to\nthe other, although the individual preferences among \\(S\\) and \\(T\\)\nstay the same. The social ranking of \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) turns on\npreferences among these states and the \u201cirrelevant\u201d\n\\(S^*\\) and similarly defined \\(T^*\\), because the fairness of \\(S\\)\nand \\(T\\) does.\nFleurbaey recommends a weaker condition, attributing it to Hansson\n(1973) and to Pazner (1979):\n\nWeak Independence: Social preferences on a pair of options\nshould only depend on the population\u2019s preferences on these two\noptions and on what options are indifferent to each of these options\nfor each individual (Fleurbaey 2007: 23).\n\nFleurbaey (2007) discusses social welfare functions satisfying weak\nindependence together with Arrow\u2019s conditions apart, of course,\nfrom I. The approach to social welfare that is sketched there\nis developed at length in (Fleurbaey and Maniquet 2011).\n",
