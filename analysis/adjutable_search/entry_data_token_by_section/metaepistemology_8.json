    "main_text": "Methodology in epistemology || Analyses in epistemology: semantic, conceptual and metaphysical\n3.2 Analyses in epistemology: semantic, conceptual and metaphysical\n\nThe project of analyzing knowledge is often identified with the task\nof satisfactorily filling in the English schema \u201cS\nknows that p if and only if ___ \u201d\n\nIn the first place, we can assess which attempts are satisfactory\n((Ichikawa & Steup 2018; Shope 1983; Littlejohn & Carter 2021:\nCh. 5), or whether all attempts are bound to fail (e.g., Williamson\n2000, 2007). Alternatively, from a metaepistemological perspective, we\nmay step back and ask what kind of thing we are doing when\nattempting to complete this schema? What is being investigated?\nDifferent answers here track different metaepistemological assumptions\nabout the role of analyses in epistemology (Sosa 2017: 66\u20137).\n(This point applies generally to analyses in epistemology, though for\nillustrative purposes here, we will focus on the simple\n\u201cS knows that p\u201d analysis.)\n\nHere is one kind of metaepistemological answer: By filling in the\nabove English schema, we are attempting to give a semantic\nanalysis of the linguistic expression \u201cS knows that\np\u201d. Those engaged in this project are investigating\nmeaning. Of course, one aim might (distally) to investigate\none thing by investigating (proximately) another. And so the\nepistemologist might purport to investigate knowledge rather\nthan merely meaning by means of a semantic analysis of\n\u201cS knows that p\u201d. This is, in fact, the\nkind of position taken by various researchers who maintain that their\npositions about the semantics of knowledge attributions should be\nunderstood as casting light on the nature of knowledge (e.g., Stanley\n2005; DeRose 2009; MacFarlane 2005; 2008b).\n\nOne limitation to this strategy\u2014viz., the strategy of\ninvestigating knowledge by way of investigating the meaning\nof knows\u2014is that (i) when aiming to establish facts\nabout meaning, we appeal inevitably to patterns of use; and (ii) the\nconnection between meaning and use is (as the philosophy of language\nsince the 1960s has shown) at most indirect (e.g., Grice 1989; Searle\n1969). As John MacFarlane captures this idea:\n\n\nEven if we restrict ourselves to sincere, knowledgeable informants,\nthe most we can discern directly from their use of sentences are the\nconditions in which they find it reasonable to use these sentences to\nmake assertions. And these are not the same as the truth conditions.\n(2008b: 783)\n\n\nA metaepistemological task of epistemologists putting forward\nsemantic analyses\u2014as theses with import in epistemology\u2014is\nto articulate how we should understand the evidential import of both\n(i) patterns of use (e.g., of \u201cknows\u201d) in supporting\nsemantic analyses (i.e., truth conditions); and (ii) semantic analyses\nin establishing nature of the referents of the terms that\nfeature in those analyses.\n\nA second metaepistemological answer to the question of what one is\ndoing when filling in the schema \u201cS knows that\np if and only if ___ \u201d is that one is illuminating\nsomething about the concept (or concepts) expressed by that\nschema. This answer will be a familiar one for those who view\nphilosophy, and so epistemology, as centrally engaged in conceptual\nanalysis (F. Jackson 1998; cf., Williamson 2018; see also for\ndiscussion Balcerak Jackson 2013). What are we investigating when\ninquiring about concepts? According to Jackson, filling in the\n\u201cS knows that p\u201d would\u2014if a matter\nof investigating concepts\u2014be in the service of explicating our\nfolk theory of knowledge by way of elucidating our concepts\n(F. Jackson 1998: 31\u201333; for discussion see Beaney 2003 [2021]:\n\u00a75), or perhaps we are investigating what is involved in\nsomeone\u2019s possession and/or deployment of a given concept (Sosa\n2015: Chapter 1). Such a characterization, both of philosophy and by\nextension of epistemology, has been subject to sustained recent\ncriticism from Williamson (2007, 2014, 2018). One common thread of\nargument Williamson adverts to draws an analogy between philosophy and\nphysics. Physicists, who also complete English schemas, are not\nplausibly regarded as investigating words and concepts; by parity of\nreasoning, it is unclear why epistemologists (or philosophers\ngenerally) should be thought to be investigating merely words and\nconcepts (rather than knowledge) any more than physicists are\ninvestigating words and concepts.\n\nThis brings us to a third kind of analysis, metaphysical\nanalysis. As Sosa puts it, when analyzing knowledge:\n\n\nHere our focus is on an objective phenomenon that need be neither\nexpression nor concept. Our focus is rather on a state that people\nhost or an act that they perform. This is the phenomenon whose\nontology we now wish to understand. What is the nature of such a state\nor act, and how is it grounded? In virtue of what is it actual when it\nis actual? (Sosa 2015: Chapter 1)\n\n\nGiven that, by ostensibly completing the English schema\n\u201cS knows that p if and only if ___ \u201d one\nmight take herself to be engaged in either semantic, conceptual, or\nmetaphysical analyses, there is an important role for metaepistemology\nto play here, in untangling potential conflations between projects. A\nfurther metaepistemological question is\u2014just as we may ask how\nsemantic analyses should inform metaphysical analyses, we may also ask\nin what way conceptual analyses inform both semantic analyses and\nmetaphysical analyses.
