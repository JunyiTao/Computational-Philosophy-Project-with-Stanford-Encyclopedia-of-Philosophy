    "main_text": "Pyrrhonian Skepticism || Aenesidemus, the Ten Modes, and Appearances\n4.2 Aenesidemus, the Ten Modes, and Appearances\n\nAenesidemus (first century BCE) was discontented with the views\ndiscussed in the Academy at his time, of which he began as an\nadherent. Philo\u2019s proto-externalism as well as a counterposition\nformulated by Antiochus both appeared to him dogmatic. Aenesidemus\naimed to revive a more radical skepticism, and left the Academy for\nthis purpose. Arguably, he is the first Pyrrhonian skeptic.\nAenesidemus wrote a treatise, the Pyrrhonian Discourses,\nprobably similar in structure to Sextus\u2019 Outlines of\nPyrrhonism and partially preserved in a summary by Photius:\na general account of skepticism, followed by books on particular\nphilosophical questions (Hankinson 2010). The basic elements of\nAenesidemus\u2019 skepticism are: the skeptic puts appearances and\nthoughts into opposition; this generates equipollence\n(isostheneia, lit. \u201cof equal weight\u201d) between\nseveral appearances and/or thoughts; suspension of judgment follows;\nwith it comes tranquility; and the skeptic leads a life according to\nappearances (DL 9.62, 78, 106\u20137). However, we do not know much\ndetail of his views on these matters. Instead, Aenesidemus is famous\nfor having developed Ten Modes or Tropes\u2014forms of argument by\nwhich the sceptic puts appearances and thoughts into opposition. Key\nquestions about Aenesidemus\u2019 skepticism concern (i) the\ninterpretation of his Modes, (ii) the relationship of his philosophy\nto competing theories, (iii) the scope of the Ten Modes, and (iv) the\nskeptic\u2019s mode of speech.\n\n(i) Conflicting Appearances or Causal Invariance. The Ten Modes are\npreserved in Diogenes Laertius (9.78\u201388), Philo of Alexandria\n(On Drunkenness 169\u2013202), and Sextus. Diogenes\u2019\naccount of the Ten Modes may postdate Sextus\u2019 (Sedley\n2015). Sextus gives extensive illustrations, and integrates the Ten\nModes into his general account of Pyrrhonism (PH\n1.36\u2013163; cf. M 7.345 for ascription of the Ten Modes\nto Aenesidemus; cf. Annas-Barnes 1985 and Hankinson 1995, 268; the\nsequence below follows Sextus). Here is the first of the Ten Modes,\ninterpreted in two ways.\n\n\n10\u20131:\n\nArguments concerning oppositions based on the differences between\nkinds of animals.\n\nConflicting Appearances Interpretation:\n\nX appears F to animal of kind A (e.g.,\nhumans) and F* to animal of kind B [where F\nand F* are opposite or otherwise incompatible properties]. We\ncannot judge how X really is, because we are a party to the\ndispute.\n\nCausal Invariance Interpretation:\n\nFor something to be \u2018really\u2019 F, it would have to\nconsistently affect different perceivers as F. But different\nconstitutions of different animals cause different impressions of the\nsame thing. For different animals, something is F and\nF* (where F and F* are opposite or\notherwise incompatible properties). Therefore, things do not seem to\nreally be F or F*.\n\n\nThe Conflicting Appearances Interpretation is based on Sextus\u2019\naccount (Annas-Barnes 1985). The focus here is on the idea that every\nkind of animal, perceiver, sensory faculty, thinker, or judger\n(depending on which mode we consider) is only one of several animals,\nperceivers, sensory faculties, thinkers, or judgers. The object is\nperceived or considered from a particular point of view. Everyone is a\nparty to the dispute, and there is no \u2018view from nowhere.\u2019\nAccordingly, the dispute cannot be decided. The Causal Invariance\nInterpretation, on the other hand, suggests that the focus on\ndecidability is introduced by Sextus. Aenesidemus may (implicitly or\nexplicitly) have endorsed the following idea: if X were\nF by nature, X would affect everyone as F.\nIf X affects different people (living beings, sensory\nfaculties, etc.) as F and F*, X is by\nnature neither F nor F*. For example, if X\nis harmful to A and beneficial to B, it is neither\nharmful nor beneficial in its nature (Woodruff 2010, Bett 2000). The\nTen Modes can generally be construed as engaging either with conflicts\nbetween appearances or with causal invariance:\n\n\n10\u20132:\n\nArguments based on the differences among human beings (differences in\nbody and in soul).\n\n10\u20133:\n\nArguments based on the differences between the senses and on the\ncomplexity of perceived objects.\n\n10\u20134:\n\nArguments based on states (dispositions and conditions of a human\nbeing, such as age, motion versus rest, emotions, etc.).\n\n10\u20135:\n\nArguments based on positions, distances, and places.\n\n10\u20136:\n\nArguments based on mixtures (objects in conjunction with external\nthings like air and humidity; physical constituents of sense organs;\nphysiology of thought).\n\n10\u20137:\n\nArguments based on the composition of the perceived object.\n\n10\u20138:\n\nArguments based on relativity (to the judging subject, to\ncircumstances, etc.). 10\u20138 comprises at least 10\u20131 to 10\u20137, or all Ten\nModes.\n\n10\u20139:\n\nArguments based on constancy or rarity of occurrence.\n\n10\u201310:\n\nArguments concerned with ways of life, customs, laws, mythical\nbeliefs, and dogmatic assumptions, all of which can be put into\nopposition to each other.\n\n\n(ii) Skepticism, Relativism, Epicureanism. Consider first the\nrelationship between skepticism and relativism (cf. Bett 2000; Vogt\n2012a, ch. 4). Relativism, as envisaged in Plato\u2019s\nTheaetetus, looks at a similar range of phenomena. Things\nappear different to different kinds of animals; to different people;\nand so on. Relativism embraces the intuition that there is (as we\nwould say today) faultless disagreement. That is, you and I disagree,\nbut neither of us is wrong. Accordingly, metaphysical relativism\nclaims we must give up the intuition that we both refer to the same\nthing. In the Theaetetus, the world dissolves into radical\nflux: there are no stable items with stable properties that we both\nrefer to.\n\nThe Ten Modes, according to Conflicting Appearances, differ from\nrelativism by turning precisely the other way (Annas-Barnes 1985,\n97\u20138; Pellegrin 1997, 552\u20133). They implicitly rely on the\nintuition that there are stable items with stable properties. Of\ncourse, the skeptic is not committed to the thesis that opposites\ncannot hold of the same thing, and that therefore no two conflicting\nappearances can be true. However, the modes presuppose a common sense\nmetaphysics that does not accommodate faultless disagreement. In all\ncases of disagreement, at best one of us can be right. If we cannot\nfigure out which view is right, we should suspend. This does not mean\nthat Pyrrhonians are committed to a common-sense metaphysics. The Ten\nModes are only one of several tools that skeptics have at their\ndisposal. They may thus imply a metaphysics that, at other points,\nskeptics would call into question (cf. Fine 2003b, 352).\n\nCausal Invariance differs from Conflicting Appearances precisely with\nrespect to the metaphysics that is, even if only dialectically,\ninvoked. Aenesidemus seems to have explored the relationship between\nskepticism and flux. He remarks that skepticism leads to Heraclitean\nphilosophy. The idea that one thing appears to have contrary\nproperties (the ones it appears to different animals/persons/senses to\nhave) leads to the idea that one thing actually has contrary\nproperties (PH 1.210; cf. Schofield 2007 on the role of\nHeraclitus and causal invariance). This remark can be taken as an\nexpression both of moderate flux and of relativism (Aenesidemus does\nnot seem to think of radical flux, where it is no longer even possible\nto refer to anything). There is no stable reality of how things are\n(moderate flux); X is F and F* insofar as,\nif X seems F to A, this is true for\nA, and F* to B, this is true for B\n(relativism). This proposal differs from the Causal Invariance\ninterpretation of the Modes presented above. There, Aenesidemus seems\nto argue that things do not really have stable properties (they are\nneither F nor F* by nature); he does not say that\nthey are F and F* (as relativism says).\n\nA third approach, competing with skepticism and relativism, is\nEpicurean epistemology. Again, the set of phenomena to be accounted\nfor is the same. But it is described differently. Epicurus insists\nthat we should not even speak of conflicting appearances. Rather, we\nshould speak of different perceptions. Perceptions cannot refute each\nother, because they are of the same weight. Epicurus here uses the\nterm that is central to Pyrrhonism: equal weight,\nisostheneia (DL 10.31\u20132). The fact that\nperceptions differ has perfectly reasonable explanations: I look from\na distance, you look from nearby; I have a cold, you are healthy; I am\na human being, another cognizer is a dog; and so on. These facts\nfigure in the explanations of how our perceptions are constituted.\nAccordingly, Epicurus argues, all perceptions, even though they\ndiffer, are true. They all have a causal history that physics can\nexplain. The precise interpretation of this proposal is controversial.\nOne might object that the notion of truth employed here is deeply\npuzzling. It is not clear what it means to describe all perceptions as\ntrue if they cannot be true or false.\n\n(iii) Scope. For the greatest part, the Ten Modes seem to be concerned\nwith perception in a broad sense, so that it includes pleasure and\npain, harm and benefit, as well as pursuit and avoidance. To perceive\nsomething as pleasant or beneficial is to pursue it. Perception and\nevaluation are also mixed in another way: depending on the frequency\nwith which we perceive something, it seems more or less amazing and\nprecious to us. 10\u201310 envisages oppositions that can\nbe construed with the help of dogmatic theses. The Ten Modes thus fit\nSextus\u2019 description of what skepticism is: the ability to put\nappearances and thoughts (phainomena and nooumena)\ninto opposition (PH 1.8, 1.31\u201333; cf. DL 9.78).\n\nAnother issue concerning the scope of the Ten Modes is whether they\naddress general or particular matters. Compare the example of whether\nthe tower is round or square (T) to the example of whether honey is\nsweet or bitter (H). (T) is a particular; the question is whether this\ntower is round or square. (H) can be construed as a particular\n(\u201cis this bit of honey sweet?\u201d), or as a general issue\n(\u201cis honey sweet?\u201d). The Ten Modes offer strategies for\nsuspension of judgment on both kinds of questions.\n\nScholars have asked whether it is a problem for skepticism if the Ten\nModes appear \u2018systematic\u2019 (Sedley 2015). A set of\narguments that aims to be complete, covering domains according to a\nstandardized pattern, may appear to be out of tune with the\nskeptic\u2019s presumed mode of investigation. Purportedly, skeptics\nthink through given questions as they arise, arriving at suspension of\njudgment in a piecemeal fashion. If this self-description is to be\ntaken at face value, then modes of generating suspension of judgment\nacross the board may appear problematic. In this respect, Diogenes\nLaertius\u2019 report of the Ten Modes may be superior to\nSextus\u2019 account. Diogenes begins with a remark that suggests\nthat skeptics pick up where other philosophers have already begun to\nmake an argument (9.78\u20139). Other philosophers have collected,\npresumably, ways in which \u2018we are persuaded\u2019, say, because\nthings regularly appear the same way. Now the skeptics, as it were in\nresponse to this, add a collection of further cases, where things do\nnot appear the same way to different cognizers. If this is the\ndialectical set-up, the Ten Modes may not be \u2018systematic\u2019\nin ways that harm skepticism. They may co-opt the patterns of dogmatic\nreports about cases where appearances are stable (Sedley 2015).\n\n(iv) Language. Aenesidemus contributes an interesting move to the\nquestion of how the skeptic can speak. Consider the relationship\nbetween a skeptic\u2019s state of mind and their utterances. One way\nto construe this relationship is that an utterance reflects a state of\nmind. This is a background assumption to the idea that, if skeptics\nuse assertoric language, they hold beliefs. Another option is to\nassume that language does not have the means to capture the\nskeptic\u2019s state of mind. On this premise, a skeptic might flag\ntheir utterances as falling short of doing so. This is\nAenesidemus\u2019 strategy. He says that the Pyrrhonian determines\nnothing, and not even this fact that he determines nothing. The\nPyrrhonian puts matters in such terms, he says, because he has no way\nto express the actual thought of the sceptic in determining nothing\n(Photius, Bibl. 169b40\u2013170a14, = 71C(6)-(8) LS).\n",
