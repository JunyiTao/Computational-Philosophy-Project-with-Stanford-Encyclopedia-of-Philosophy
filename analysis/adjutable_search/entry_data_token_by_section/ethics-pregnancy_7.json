It is\ntypically a sacrosanct principle in medical ethics that patients have\nan absolute right to refuse medical interventions, including\nlife-saving interventions, if they make an autonomous, informed,\ncompetent choice to do so. However, in the case of pregnant women,\nthis principle has been questioned and sometimes violated by force in\nthe name of protecting the fetus. Examples have included forced\ncesarean deliveries, mandatory HIV testing, and life-saving blood\ntransfusions performed despite religious objections.\n\nThe 1987 case of Angela Carder, a 27-year-old woman who had cancer\nthat had gone into remission but recurred during her pregnancy,\nbrought these issues to a head. Fully competent, Carder made clear\nthat she wanted everything possible done to save her life. However,\nduring the 25th week of gestation, it became clear that\nCarder was dying. George Washington University Medical Center, where\nshe was a patient, tried to insist upon an early cesarean section\ndelivery in order to save her fetus. She refused the intervention,\nwhich was nearly certain to kill her, with the support of her family,\nhusband, and doctors, but the hospital obtained a court order and\nforced the delivery. Both Carder and her extremely premature baby\nsurvived the operation only very briefly. In 1990, the D.C. Court of\nAppeals posthumously vacated the court-ordered cesarean section,\nholding that Carder had the right to make health care decisions for\nherself and her fetus, and that only in the most exceptional\ncircumstances should a pregnant woman's right to refuse interventions\nbe called into question (Thornton and Paltrow, 1991).\n\nForced interventions have also taken place more recently. In 2009,\nSamantha Burton was forced to stay in hospital for prescribed bedrest\nwhen her membranes ruptured at 25 weeks. Burton's competence was not\nin doubt, but her interests in leaving the hospital (to return to her\nother children and her job) were overridden because her fetus could be\nexposed to greater risk if she failed to comply with bedrest orders.\nThe hospital's obstetrician testified in favour of court-ordered care\nin the role of the fetus's attending physician, and the judge ruled\nthat any interventions required for the fetus should be administered.\nA few days later the fetus was delivered by cesarean, already dead.\nThis case illustrates how pregnant women's rights to refuse\ninterventions are still treated as violable in cases where refusing\ncare may harm the fetus (for discussion see Cantor 2012, Charles\n2011).\n\nNevertheless, there is now widespread legal and ethical agreement in\nlight of the Carder case that pregnant women, as autonomous adults and\nfull citizens, do not lose their constitutional rights to privacy and\nbodily integrity in light of their pregnancy (Pollitt 1990). These\nrights continue to hold in cases where exercising them may result in\nthe death of a fetus or in harm to the child the fetus will become.\nEven when the survival of a fetus depends on a pregnant woman\nundergoing some intervention, she can no more be compelled to consent\nto it than anyone else could be compelled to undergo a medical\nintervention to save another person. Some authors have expressed\nconcern that forcing interventions on pregnant women for the sake of\nthe fetus contributes to our cultural imagining of the fetus as a\nfull-fledged person who functions as a patient with rights and medical\nneeds equivalent to the woman's own (Nelson and Milliken 1988, Roth\n2003). Indeed, as Paltrow and Flavin (2013) discuss, even embryos and\nfertilized eggs may enjoy the protections of personhood status, albeit\nnot as a result of formal legislation. Evidence suggests that wide\nacceptance of such extensions of personhood will be particularly\ndetrimental to the procreative autonomy of vulnerable women (ibid). On\nthe other hand, some forced interventions are designed to improve the\nhealth of the children that fetuses will become. If the fetus will\nsurvive, there will eventually be a full-fledged person with interests\nthat can be harmed during pregnancy. So forced interventions do not\nnecessarily personify the fetus; they may instead force the\npregnant woman to sacrifice her own well-being or autonomy for the\nsake of her future child. But even if the intervention furthers the\ninterests of a person\u2014either a future person, or a fetal person\nif we accept that there are such things\u2014it may be unjust to\npermit overruling pregnant women's interests in favour of fetal\ninterests. In fact, since we do not force medical interventions on\nanyone in order to save another fully developed, rights-bearing\nperson, a double standard that allows forced interventions on pregnant\nwomen seems to enshrine the fetus or future child as more\nvaluable and deserving of protection than born persons (Minkoff and\nPaltrow 2004).\n\nEven if forced interventions on competent pregnant women are virtually\nnever justified, there may be good moral reasons why pregnant women\nought not to refuse various interventions in particular cases. One\nmight argue that, at least in the case of voluntary pregnancy, the\npregnant woman has taken on a special duty to protect the well-being\nof her future child in continuing to be pregnant. Savulescu (2007a)\nargues for a \u2018duty of easy rescue\u2019\u2014regardless of\nwhether the fetus counts as a person, he claims, a pregnant woman has\na duty to allow acts that do not significantly harm her while\nprotecting her future child from significant harm (see also Draper\n1996). Chervenak and McCullough (1991) argue that sometimes refusal of\ntreatment can be expected to result in further medical complications,\nand hence constitutes an implicit positive demand for alternative\ntreatment that may be more costly. While we typically take refusals of\ntreatment to be sacrosanct, our respect for autonomy does not extend\nto recognizing an unlimited right to demand particular interventions\nat will. If a pregnant woman's refusal of a treatment that would stave\noff premature birth, for instance, implicitly involves demand for\nexpensive care for her premature infant, it is unclear that she has\nthe moral right to refuse treatment. On the face of it, this argument\nis not specific to pregnant women. However, non-pregnant citizens who\nshoulder extra risk by refusing treatment could in principle commit to\nrefraining from using future medical resources, whereas pregnant women\narguably have no moral or legal right to do so on behalf of their\nfuture children. Hence they may have special moral responsibilities\nnot to refuse interventions in some cases.\n\nOn the other hand, the question of the ethical responsibilities of\npregnant women ought to remain separate from the question of what they\ncan be compelled to do by law, medical authority, or brute\nforce (Draper 1996, Nelson and Milliken 1988). Even if pregnant women\nsometimes have a moral duty not to refuse interventions, this\ndoes not count against the conclusion that, as full citizens, they\nhave the same privacy and bodily integrity rights as all other\ncitizens, even when their exercise of these rights involves morally\nproblematic behavior.\n\nIn the wake of the Carder ruling, cases of forcing a manifestly\ncompetent pregnant woman to undergo an intervention over her\nobjections have been rare. However, forced interventions are still\nsometimes performed on women who are vulnerable due to poverty, mental\nillness, immigration status, racism, etc. (Roth 2003, Roberts 1996).\nThese vulnerable women, whose contact with the health care system is\nmore likely to be fragmented, are more open to being assessed as\nincompetent when their expressed decision differs sharply from the\njudgment of medical professionals responsible for their care. Social\nmarginalization can create the appearance of incompetence, and it can\nalso genuinely hamper competence when it comes to negotiating\nphysician-patient interactions.\n\nCases involving possible forced interventions on pregnant women are\noften framed as cases of \u2018maternal-fetal conflict\u2019, in\nwhich doctors or courts must adjudicate between the wishes of the\nwoman and the well-being or rights of the fetus (Draper 1996, Van\nBogaert 2006). Such a framing positions the fetus as in need of\nrescuing from a callous mother. Several authors have argued, however,\nthat we ought to presume that almost all expectant mothers are\nconcerned about the well-being of their future children and do not\ntake an adversarial stance towards them (Minkoff and Paltrow 2004,\nFinn 1998). With this in mind, some authors conclude that the very\nnotion of maternal-fetal conflict ought to be discarded; not only may\nit undermine pregnant women's autonomy, it falsely describes the\nnature and source of the conflict. Baylis, Rodgers, and Young (2008)\nargue that the pertinent conflict is typically between pregnant women\nand others who presume authority regarding the appropriate care of the\nfetus, and that it is not in any case typically a conflict between the\nmother and the fetus. In this light, we ought to first try to\nunderstand disagreements between pregnant women and their doctors over\npotential interventions in terms of different understandings of what\nwould best promote maternal and fetal well-being. Such disagreements\nare perhaps better cast as maternal-physician conflicts than as\nmaternal-fetal conflicts. Furthermore, the fact that vulnerable women\nare most frequently the ones that find themselves in an adversarial\nrelationship with their caregivers suggests that we ought to look for\nsocial factors that create miscommunication and conflict rather than\nsimply casting such women as bad mothers whose fetuses must be\nprotected from their selfish decisions (Finn 1998).\n",
