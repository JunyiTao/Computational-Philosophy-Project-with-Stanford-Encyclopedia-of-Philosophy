    "main_text": "Are there intentional objects?\n7. Are there intentional objects?\n\nSections 4, 5 and 6 described three moves made within the orthodox\nparadigm in analytic philosophy in response to puzzles raised by the\nintentionality of singular thoughts about concrete particulars. In\nparticular, the dispute between the theory of direct reference and\neither the Fregean distinction between sense and reference or the\nRussellian assumption that ordinary proper names are disguised\ndefinite descriptions can be seen as internal to the orthodox paradigm\naccording to which there are only existing objects, i.e., concrete\nparticulars in space and time. Brentano, however, sketched the\npossibility of an alternative paradigm based on the acceptance of the\nview that intentional objects may be non-existent objects or abstract\nobjects. (For a general survey of the role of Brentano in the\nemergence of the non-orthodox theory of intentional objects in\nAustrian philosophy, see Smith, 1994.)\n\nTo see how the theory of intentional objects flows from\nBrentano\u2019s characterization of intentionality, recall (from\nsection 2) that it follows from the nature of intentionality (as\ndescribed by Brentano\u2019s first thesis) that nothing could exhibit\nintentionality unless there were objects \u2013 intentional objects\n\u2013 that satisfied the property Brentano called \u201cintentional\ninexistence.\u201d Consider the following inference schema licensed\nby the rule of existential generalization and instantiated by the\nnon-intentional relation expressed by the English verb\n\u201ckiss\u201d in (11):\n\n11a. Cleopatra kissed Caesar.\n\n11b. Cleopatra kissed something.\n\n\nIf (11a) is true, so is (11b). The question is: is this valid\ninference schema also instantiated by the following pairs (12)-(15)\ninvolving intentional relations?\n\n12a. Cleopatra loved Caesar.\n\n12b. Cleopatra loved something.\n\n\n13a. The Ancient Greeks worshiped Zeus.\n\n13b. The Ancient Greeks worshiped something.\n\n14a. Ponce de Leon searched for the fountain of youth.\n\n14b. Ponce de Leon searched for something.\n\n15a. Modern criminologists admire Sherlock Holmes.\n\n15b. Modern criminologists admire something.\n\n\nOn the one hand, unlike (11), (12)-(15) involve intentional relations.\nOn the other hand, unlike the intentional relation in (12), the\nintentional relations in (13)-(15) seem to involve particulars which\ndon\u2019t exist (or haven\u2019t existed) in space and time.\nIntentional-object theorists hold that the above inferences involving\nboth non-intentional and intentional relations constitute data that\ncall for a consistent explanation. In other words, the\nintentional-object theorist accepts, whereas his critic rejects, the\nvalidity of the rule of existential generalization for both\nintentional and non-intentional relations, whether the relata of the\nintentional relations are concrete particulars in space and time or\nnot. On the non-orthodox assumption that the inference schema\ninstantiated by (11) can be instantiated by (12)-(15) as well, then in\nlogical notation, the second coordinate of every pair (11)-(15) should\nbe symbolized thus:\n\n11c. \u2203x(Cleopatra kissed x)\n\n12c. \u2203x(Cleopatra loved x)\n\n13c. \u2203x(Ancient Greeks worshiped x)\n\n14c. \u2203x(Ponce de Leon searched for x)\n\n15c. \u2203x(Modern criminologists admire x)\n\n\nThus, the issue between the intentional-object theorist and his critic\nis whether the variable bound by the standard existential quantifier\nof first-order logic should range not merely over concrete particulars\nexisting in space and time but also over all sorts of other entities\nas well. Note that the issue is orthogonal to the contrast between the\nobjectual and the substitutional interpretation of the existential\nquantifier since the dispute over the admission of intentional objects\nis wholly internal to the objectual interpretation of the quantifier.\nThe question that arises for the intentional-object theorist is: what\nis the best theory of the objects over which (13c)-(15c) seem to\nquantify?\n\nMeinong (1904) supposed that objects like Zeus, the fountain of youth,\nSherlock Holmes, etc., are non-existent objects which exemplify the\nproperties attributed to them. On his view, the fountain of youth is\nan object that instantiates both the property of being a fountain and\nthat of having waters which confer everlasting life. But it fails to\ninstantiate the property of existence. Meinong seemed to suppose that\nfor any group of properties, there is an object which instantiates\nthose properties. Some of the resulting objects exist and others do\nnot. Russell (1905) found this view of intentional objects\nontologically unacceptable since it involves the acceptance of\nentities such as golden mountains (which are inconsistent with\nphysical and chemical laws) and round squares (which are inconsistent\nwith the laws of geometry). His theory of definite descriptions was\nprecisely designed to avoid these ontological consequences (see\nsection 5). However, by clarifying distinctions proposed by both\nMeinong and his student Ernst Mally, Parsons (1980) has recently\noffered a theory of non-existent objects, which is based on the\nassumption that existence is a special kind of property. This theory\nuses a quantifier \u201c\u2203\u201d, which does not imply\nexistence. To assert existence, he uses the predicate\n\u201cE!\u201d. Thus, the assertion that there are\nnon-existent objects can be represented in Parsons\u2019 theory\nwithout contradiction by the logical formula\n\u201c\u2203x(~E!x).\u201d Furthermore, Parsons\ndistinguishes between \u201cnuclear\u201d and\n\u201cextranuclear\u201d properties. Only the former, which are\nordinary, non-intentional kinds of properties, contribute to\nindividuating objects. The set of extranuclear properties involve\nintentional properties, modal properties and existence. Armed with\nthis distinction among properties, Parsons (1980) has been able to\navoid Russell\u2019s objections to Meinong\u2019s naive theory of\nintentional objects. (For further details, see Parsons, 1980.) An\noriginal account of the possibility of entertaining true thoughts\nabout non-existent objects, based on the contrast between pleonastic\n(or representation-dependent) and non-pleonastic (natural or\nsubstantial) properties, has been developed by Crane (2013).\n\nThe theory of intentional objects has also been developed in a\nslightly different way. Meinong\u2019s student Ernst Mally (1912)\nproposed that fictional and mythical objects, as well as objects like\nround squares, do not instantiate the properties attributed to them\nbut \u201chave\u201d those properties in a different way. For Mally,\nthe fountain of youth is \u201cdetermined\u201d by the properties of\nbeing a fountain and having waters which confer everlasting life, but\nthis object doesn\u2019t instantiate those properties in the\ntraditional sense. Given Mally\u2019s distinction, the fact that\nthere is an object which is determined by the properties of being\ngolden and of being a mountain does not contradict the contingent fact\nthat nothing instantiates these two properties, nor does Mally have to\nthink of intentional objects as non-existent. Rather, he treats them\nas existing abstract objects. Thus, whereas Parsons uses two kinds of\nproperties to develop a theory of non-existent objects, a neo-Mallyan\nsuch as Zalta (1988) uses two kinds of predication \u2013\nexemplification (which corresponds to instantiation) and encoding\n(which corresponds to Mally\u2019s notion of determination) \u2013\nto develop a theory of abstract objects. These abstract objects are\npart of the explanations of both the truths expressed by (13a)-(15a)\nand the validity of the inferences in (13a,b)-(15a,b). As such,\nabstract objects may well exist. Nonetheless, some abstract objects\n(e.g., Sherlock Holmes and Zeus) may be said \u201cnot to\nexist\u201d in the sense that nothing exemplifies the properties\nwhich they encode.\n\nThough Quine\u2019s (1948) well-known paper \u201cOn what there\nis,\u201d raises serious ontological questions for intentional-object\ntheories, both Parsons and Zalta have provided answers to\nQuine\u2019s queries, in their respective work. Nonetheless, to this\nday, many contemporary philosophers have been reluctant to embrace\nintentional-object theories for two related reasons. First of all,\nthey have been eager to avoid what they see as the heavy ontological\ncommitments incurred by intentional-object theories. Secondly, the\nontology of non-existent and abstract objects has seemed difficult to\nsquare with the ontology of the contemporary natural sciences\naccording to which the world contains only concrete objects that exist\nin space and time. (See Section 9 for further discussion.)\n\nThe theory of intentional objects, however, may derive support from\nthe following, arguably counterintuitive, consequences of\nFrege\u2019s and Russell\u2019s views, respectively. Frege\u2019s\ntheory faces two problems. First (13a)-(15a) would appear to express\ntruths. But on Frege\u2019s view, they lack a truth-value, since they\ninvolve singular terms devoid of reference and, according to Frege, if\npart of a sentence lacks a reference, then the sentence itself fails\nto have a truth-value (see section 4). Secondly, the inferences in\n(13)-(15) appear to be valid. But on Frege\u2019s view, one cannot\nvalidly infer (13b) from (13a) if (13a) has no truth-value. Similarly\nfor the other pair of sentences (14) and (15). Russell\u2019s view\nfaces two analogous problems. First, as noted above, (13a)-(15a)\nappear to be true. But on Russell\u2019s analysis, proper names such\nas \u201cZeus\u201d in (13a) and \u201cSherlock Holmes\u201d in\n(15a) are abbreviated definite descriptions and, given his analysis of\ndefinite descriptions, both (13a) and (15a) turn out to express false\nexistentially quantified propositions (see section 5). Secondly, if\n(13a)-(15a) are indeed false, as Russell\u2019s view would have it,\nthen one cannot validly infer (13b)-(15b), respectively, from their\ncorresponding premisses. For a recent novel account of the distinction\nbetween true and false thoughts about non-existent objects, cf. Crane\n(2013) and for further discussion of the general topic of existence,\nsee the SEP entry on existence.\n",
