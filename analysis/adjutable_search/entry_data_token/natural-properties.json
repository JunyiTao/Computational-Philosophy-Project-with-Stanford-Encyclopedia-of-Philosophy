Pairs of properties\n\n\nIt is easy to get enough of a feel for what is going on in this table\nto the point where one could confidently say, for many other such\npairs, which would be better to put in Column\u00a01 and which in the\nColumn\u00a02. This article is concerned with a semi-technical use of\nthe word \u2018natural\u2019 which can be illustrated by these\nexamples: in each case, the property in the Column\u00a01 is more\nnatural than the corresponding property in the Column\u00a02.\nThis use has deep historical roots (see\n \u00a72),\n but was cemented in a seminal paper by David Lewis\n (1983),\n and has subsequently been taken up by many other authors.\n\nDespite what the word may suggest, the claim that one property is more\nnatural than another is not meant to entail that the latter is in any\nsense created or influenced by human beings to a greater extent than\nthe former. Even when a property is highly unnatural, we may have\nlittle or no ability to influence what instantiates it, or whether it\nexists. (Indeed many hold that all properties exist necessarily.) For\nthis reason it may be misleading to use \u2018artificial\u2019 as\nthe antonym of \u2018natural\u2019. \u2018Arbitrary\u2019 is\nbetter, and \u2018gerrymandered\u2019 is popular.\n\nThose who use \u2018natural\u2019 in the relevant way conceive\nnaturalness to be an objective matter, at least in the\nfollowing sense: if \\(F\\) is more natural than \\(G\\), \\(F\\) would\nstill have been more natural than \\(G\\) if our interests and practices\nhad been very different, and indeed even if intelligent life had not\nexisted at all. Most would endorse the stronger claim that when \\(F\\)\nis more natural than \\(G\\), it is necessary that \\(F\\) is\nmore natural than\n \\(G\\).[1]\n\n\nLike most philosophical terms of art which lack official,\nuncontroversial definitions, the relevant use of \u2018natural\u2019\nis controversial: many philosophers regard it as too unclear, or too\nclosely tied to some false presupposition, to be helpful. Among this\ngroup, some would go so far as to deny that there is any\ninteresting or theoretically important relation holding between the\npairs of properties listed in the above table, at least if we set\naside relations (like being expressible more briefly than)\nwhose pattern of instantiation would have been different if our\ninterests or practices had been different. On this picture, the very\nidea that some properties are more natural than others embodies a\nmistaken projection onto the world itself of differences which are in\nfact just a matter of the contingent concerns and purposes of human\nbeings.\n\nNevertheless, the notion of a natural property has enjoyed a wide\ncurrency in recent philosophy, especially in metaphysics. Lewis\ndevelops a rich body of theory in which naturalness plays a central\npart, and other philosophers have built on and modified Lewis\u2019s\nideas in various ways. As we will see in\n \u00a73,\n naturalness has been invoked in theorising about a wide range of\ntopics, including similarity, modality, laws of nature, mental and\nlinguistic content, ampliative inference, and epistemic value. These\nroles provide many different ways of getting a grip on what\nnaturalness is supposed to be, and why it might be interesting and\ntheoretically important.\n", "toc": [{"#PerfNatuDegrNatu": "1.

Perfect naturalness and degrees of naturalness\n\nNaturalness comes in degrees. But an important part of Lewis\u2019s\npicture, also dominant in the subsequent literature, is that it has a\nmaximal degree. Some properties are perfectly\nnatural. They are all equally natural, and no properties are more\nnatural than them. Lewis also calls these \u201cfundamental\u201d\nproperties. And the connotations of the word \u2018fundamental\u2019\nare apt. According to Lewis, there is a good sense in which one would\nhave exhaustively described the world if one said which\nthings (or \\(n\\)-tuples of things) instantiate each perfectly natural\nproperty, and in which one would have failed to exhaustively\ndescribe the world if one merely provided this information for some\nbut not all of the perfectly natural properties. As we will see in\n \u00a74.4,\n Lewis cashes out these thoughts in modal terms: all truths are\nnecessitated by the truths about the distribution of all\nperfectly natural properties, but not by the truths about the\ndistribution of only some of the perfectly natural properties. Others,\nlike Sider\n (2011),\n have explored quite different ways of cashing them out.\n\nGiving examples of perfectly natural properties is not supposed to be\neasy. Views that identify certain properties as perfectly natural are\nbold hypotheses about the fundamental structure of reality, and thus\nbound up with many central debates in metaphysics. According to Lewis,\nthe methods of physics have a central role to play in the project of\nidentifying the perfectly natural properties. Until we have the kind\nof final theory that many physicists are aiming for, we should not\nhope to be able to list the actually-instantiated perfectly natural\n properties.[2]\n But looking to physics in this way is already taking a stand on many\ncontroversial questions in philosophy. Those inclined towards dualism\nin the philosophy of mind (see the entries on\n dualism\n and\n physicalism)\n may hold that some mental properties\u2014for example,\nconsciousness, or specific phenomenal states, or relations like\nacquaintance, judgment or knowledge\u2014are perfectly natural;\nindeed, this might with some plausibility be regarded as definitive of\ndualism. Similarly, those inclined towards \u201cnon-naturalist\nrealism\u201d in metaethics (see the entry on\n moral non-naturalism)\n may hold that some normative or evaluative\nproperties, such as goodness, betterness, or moral permissibility, are\nperfectly natural.\n\nPerfect naturalness is generally understood to be definable in terms\nof relative naturalness: a property is perfectly natural just in case\nno property is more natural than it. But Lewis also held that relative\nnaturalness could be defined in terms of perfect naturalness: \\(F\\) is\nmore natural than \\(G\\) just in case \\(F\\) has a shorter and less\ncomplex definition in terms of perfectly natural properties than \\(G\\)\n(Lewis\n 1986b,\n 61). Here, a \u201cdefinition\u201d of a property can be understood\nas an expression referring to that property in a formal language which\nonly has simple predicates expressing perfectly natural properties (in\naddition to certain logical resources which allow complex predicates\nto be constructed out of these simple\n ones).[3]\n This claim has been controversial even among naturalness enthusiasts.\nOne influential worry (raised in Sider\n 1995)\n is that many of the properties we are interested in, and between\nwhich we need to draw distinctions of naturalness (e.g.\u00a0greenness\nand grueness), will only have infinite definitions in terms\nof the perfectly natural properties, so that they will all come out\nequally\n natural.[4]\n Nevertheless, length and complexity of definitions has been broadly\naccepted at least as a heuristic guide. For example, someone who held\nthat adjacency and chargedness were perfectly\nnatural would be expected to hold that being adjacent to something\ncharged is more natural than being adjacent to an uncharged\nthing that is adjacent to something charged.\n2. History\n\nThe history of philosophical theorising about properties and\nproperty-like entities (concepts, predicates, terms, forms,\nuniversals, qualities\u2026) contains many contrasts that seem\nbroadly similar to the contrast between more and less natural\nproperties, or between perfectly natural properties and the rest. A\nfew examples:\n\nIn a much-cited passage in the Phaedrus (265e), Plato\nsays giving a good definition involves \u201cdividing things\u2026\nwhere the natural joints are, and not trying to break any part, after\nthe manner of a bad carver\u201d.\n\n\nElsewhere (Parmenides 130a\u2013e), Plato suggests that\nsome but not all predicates correspond to Forms: there are Forms of\njustice, beauty, and goodness but no Forms of hair, mud, or dirt. (See\nthe entry on\n Plato\u2019s Parmenides)\nAristotle (De Interpretatione 11: 20b15\u201322)\ndistinguishes between terms with \u201cunity\u201d, like\n\u2018white\u2019, \u2018walking\u2019, \u2018man\u2019,\n\u2018animal\u2019, and \u2018rational animal\u2019, and other\nterms that lack unity, like \u2018walking white man\u2019. He also\nmakes a further distinction between genuine terms (which include both\nthose with and without unity) and \u2018indefinite names\u2019 like\n\u2018non-walking\u2019 and \u2018non-man\u2019.\nIn classical and medieval Indian philosophy, the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika tradition distinguishes \u201cgenuine\nuniversals\u201d (j\u0101ti) from \u201cimposed\u201d or\n\u201cnominal\u201d properties (up\u0101dhi). The\ntenth-century logician Udayana lists six \u201cimpediments\u201d\nwhich can be used to show that a word does not stand for a\nj\u0101ti: for example, no two j\u0101ti are\ncoextensive, and if two j\u0101ti share an instance, then one\nis such that every instance of it is also an instance of the other.\n(For more details and citations, see the entry on\n analytic philosophy in Early Modern India.)\nThere is a long tradition (stretching back to Plato and Aristotle)\naccording to which some properties (terms, concepts, forms,\u2026)\nare simple (primitive, indefinable, unanalysable), and while\nthe remainder are complex\u2014some more complex than\nothers\u2014and in some sense \u201cdefinable\u201d from the simple\nones. One author who is particularly interested in this contrast, and\nwho conceives of it in a way that makes it clearly one of metaphysics\nas opposed to mere human psychology, is Leibniz. He argues that there\nmust be absolutely simple terms for it to be possible to conceive of\nanything at all (Mates\n 1986,\n 58). He has no settled view as regards what these absolutely simple\nterms are, although he does at one point (Leibniz\n 1680\u201385)\n suggest a list of \u201csimpler\u201d terms in terms of which all\nothers can be defined.\nThe founding figures of analytic philosophy continue this\ntradition. Moore\n (1903,\n \u00a71.7) argues that \u2018good\u2019 denotes something\n\u201csimple and unanalysable\u201d, whereas \u2018horse\u2019\ndenotes something complex. (See the entry on\n G. E. Moore.)\n Bertrand Russell\n (1918,\n 111) claims that the \u201cultimate simples, out of which the world\nis built\u201d include simple particulars, simple qualities, and\nsimple relations. (See the entry on\n Russell\u2019s logical atomism.)\n Later, Ramsey\n (1925)\n argues for eliminating all complex properties, so that most\npredicates will not correspond to properties at all. \nIn David Armstrong\u2019s theory of universals (Armstrong\n 1978),\n which Lewis credits as the main inspiration for his work on\nnaturalness, many predicates do not correspond to universals at all;\nmoreover, some universals are more complex than others, and some may\nindeed be perfectly simple.\n\n\nThe tradition of theorising about \u201csimple\u201d and\n\u201ccomplex\u201d properties is a particularly important\nantecedent for the contemporary use of \u2018natural\u2019, for two\nreasons. First, one can ask both whether a property is more or less\nsimple than some other property, and whether it is perfectly simple.\nSecond, whereas it is supposed to be relatively easy to tell in many\ncases that a property is complex, identifying perfectly simple\nproperties is generally not supposed to be easy: such claims need to\nbe argued for as part of some ambitious metaphysical theory. The\ncentral difference between this traditional use of\n\u2018simple\u2019 and the contemporary use of \u2018natural\u2019\nis that the former use is bound up with a battery of assumed analogies\nbetween properties and other kinds of entities\u2014concrete objects,\nor linguistic expressions\u2014which the latter use does not require.\nThe claim that a property is complex is understood to entail that in\nsome sense it has other properties as \u201cparts\u201d, from which\nit is \u201cput together\u201d; the perfectly simple properties are\nexactly those that lack parts\u2014the analogues of letters or words\nin the realm of linguistic expressions. The paradigm for\n\u201cparthood\u201d is the relation between the conjunction of two\nproperties and each of those two properties: for example, being\nred and being square would be taken to be parts of\nbeing red and square. Indeed, for most of the history of this\ntradition this seems to be the only clearly recognised form of\ncomplexity; insofar as properties like not being red and\nsquare are recognised at all, they seem to be excluded from the\ndomain to which distinctions of simplicity are to be applied. Only\nrelatively late, in the works of authors like Moore and Russell, do we\nfind a picture where conjunction is merely one of several different\noperations for building complex properties, others including\ndisjunction, existential quantification, etc. The contemporary use of\n\u2018natural\u2019 is plausibly seen as a cleaned-up version of\nthis older tradition, purged of the additional assumptions that might\nbe read into the mereological terminology. It is compatible with the\nthesis of \u201cintensionalism\u201d, according to which necessarily\ncoextensive properties are identical; Lewis was in fact an influential\ndefender of this thesis. Given intensionalism, the fact that a\nproperty can be derived from other properties by logical operations\nlike conjunction cannot rule out its being perfectly natural, since\neven a perfectly natural property \\(F\\) will be identical to the\nconjunction of \\(F\\)-or-\\(G\\) with \\(F\\)-or-not-\\(G\\), for any other\nproperty \\(G\\). However the contemporary use is also compatible with\nfiner-grained views about the identity of properties, and it would be\nnatural for proponents of such views to hold that no perfectly natural\nproperty is a conjunction, disjunction, existential quantification,\netc. Such generalizations will be considered further in\n \u00a74.10\n below.\n3. Related uses of \u2018natural\u2019\n\n\u2018Natural\u2019 is sometimes used in ways that are closely\nrelated to our target use, but applied to things other than\nproperties. This section will survey some of these uses and discuss\nhow they might relate to the target use.\n3.1 Natural classes\n\nAs part of his notorious \u201cmodal realism\u201d (see \u00a76 of\nthe entry on\n David Lewis),\n Lewis identified properties with sets: for example, the property of\nbeing a talking donkey is just the set of all talking donkeys (a set\nwhich Lewis, surprisingly, held to be nonempty). Few philosophers have\naccepted this view. The dominant view is that distinct properties can\nhave exactly the same instances, although distinct sets never have\nexactly the same members. Many are nevertheless happy to apply\n\u2018natural\u2019 to sets (or classes) as well as properties: for\nexample, the class of all green things would be counted as more\nnatural than the class of grue things.\n\nIt seems plausible that there should be some intimate connection\nbetween this notion of naturalness for classes and naturalness for\nproperties; but it is not obvious how it should be spelled out. Since\nthere seem to be differences in naturalness among coextensive\nproperties\u2014for example, being charged seems more\nnatural than being charged and not a talking\ndonkey\u2014identifying a property\u2019s degree of naturalness\nwith that of its extension (the class of its instances) is not a\npromising approach. More plausibly, one might identify the degree of\nnaturalness of a class with the maximum degree of naturalness\nof the properties whose extension it is, or with some kind of\naggregate of the degrees of naturalness of these properties. However,\nthis may still be too simple, since there is a case that the\nnaturalness of other properties need to be taken into account. For\nexample, if there is a very natural equivalence relation (reflexive,\nsymmetric, transitive relation) with only a few equivalence classes,\nwe might want to count those equivalence classes as highly natural\neven if they are not the extensions of any highly natural monadic\nproperties.\n3.2 Plural naturalness.\n\nEspecially since Boolos\n (1984),\n it is widely accepted that there is an important distinction between\nplural quantification (\u2018there are some things such\nthat\u2026them\u2026\u2019) and singular quantification over sets\n(\u2018there is a set of things such that\u2026it\u2026\u2019),\nand between applying a predicate collectively to some things\n(\u2018these people could lift a piano\u2019) and applying a\npredicate to a set (\u2018this set of people could lift a\npiano\u2019) (see the entry on\n plural quantification).[5]\n \u2018Natural\u2019 is sometimes used as a plural predicate (Dorr\n 2007;\n Rosen\n 2015).\n It would be tendentious to equate the claim that some things are\ncollectively natural with the claim that they form a natural class:\nfor example, the things that are not charged seem collectively rather\nnatural, although they presumably do not form a class (since if they\ndid, it would have to include itself as a member). It is more\nplausible to go the other way, analysing \u2018natural class\u2019\nas \u2018class whose members are collectively natural\u2019. The\ntask of explaining plural naturalness in terms of the naturalness of\nproperties raises similar difficulties to that of explaining the\nnaturalness of classes.\n3.3 Natural propositions and concepts\n\nOnce one is accustomed to comparing the naturalness of properties, it\nis natural to want to extend such comparisons to propositions. For\nexample, the proposition that some things are green should count as\nmore natural than the proposition that some things are grue. While the\nuse of \u2018natural\u2019 to apply to propositions is rare, talk of\npropositions\u2014or of proposition-like entities like\nhypotheses, theories, accounts,\nproposals, etc.\u2014as being more or less simple\nis ubiquitous, in science as well as philosophy, and arguably amounts\nto the same thing.\n\nA few authors identify propositions with properties: for example,\nLewis\n (1986b,\n 53\u20134) holds that the proposition that some swans are blue is\nbeing a world containing a blue swan. Others (e.g. Bealer\n 1982)\n reject this identification, but still treat propositions as\nproperty-like: as binary relations stand to the number 2 and monadic\nproperties stand to 1, propositions stand to 0. Given either of these\nviews, the notion of a natural proposition should raise no new\n difficulties.[6]\n\nThis way of thinking of propositions is not universal, however. For\nmany authors, a central role of propositions is to play a certain role\nin the theory of mental states and/or linguistic meaning (see the\nentry on\n propositions).\n This role is often taken to motivate an account of propositions as\nmore \u201cfinely individuated\u201d than properties. For example,\nsome would distinguish the proposition that there are vixens from the\nproposition that there are female foxes, on the grounds that someone\ncould believe one but not the other, while also identifying the\nproperty of being a vixen with the property of being a female fox.\nMany who hold such views also recognise a coarser-grained\ndomain of entities\u2014sometimes called \u2018states of\naffairs\u2019 (see the entry on\n states of affairs)\u2014that\n stand to 0 as \\(n\\)-ary properties stand to \\(n\\). Some also\nrecognise fine-grained entities, sometimes called concepts,\nthat stand to positive integers as propositions stand to 0. For\nexample, they may say that the concept being a vixen is\ndistinct from the concept being a female fox, although they\ncorrespond to the same property. In this setting, it is less obvious\nhow one might understand comparisons of naturalness for propositions\nand concepts, assuming one wants to allow for differences in\nnaturalness between distinct propositions corresponding to the same\nstate of affairs, or between distinct concepts corresponding to the\nsame property. The question how such comparisons might be conceived,\nand whether they have anything to do with naturalness for properties,\nwill depend on issues in the theory of mental and linguistic content\nthat are beyond the scope of this article.\n3.4 \u2018Natural\u2019 as a higher-order predicate\n\nWe have been assuming an \u201cabundant\u201d theory of properties,\non which we can take for granted that there are such properties as\nbeing negatively charged and not part of a fish, being\ngrue, and so on. But one can easily slip into inconsistency in\ntalking like this. The obvious generalization is the following\nschema:\n\nNa\u00efve Comprehension\n\nFor any \\(x\\), \\(\\phi(x)\\) if and only if \\(x\\) instantiates being\nan \\(x\\) such that \\(\\phi(x)\\) \n\nUnfortunately, this is inconsistent (given classical logic) because of\nRussell\u2019s paradox: it entails that being an \\(x\\) such that\n\\(x\\) does not instantiate \\(x\\) instantiates itself if and only\nif it doesn\u2019t instantiate itself, and hence that it both does\nand does not instantiate itself. So any \u201cabundant\u201d theory\nof properties needs to be crafted with care.\n\nLewis combined the identification of properties with classes with a\nstandard mathematical theory of sets and classes (Lewis\n 1991),\n on which some things\u2014such as the classes\u2014are too numerous\nto form a class. His view thus provides for such properties as\nbeing grue, but provides no good candidate referents for\nterms like \u2018being a property\u2019, \u2018being instantiated\nby all triangles\u2019, \u2018identity\u2019, \u2018being more\nnatural than\u2019, etc. Intuitive claims like \u2018identity is\nmore natural than being as tall as\u2019 are thus hard to\naccommodate.\n\nOne possible reaction to this situation is to regiment \u2018is\nperfectly natural\u2019, \u2018is more natural than\u2019, etc. not\nas ordinary predicates\u2014expressions that combine with names or\nordinary variables to form sentences\u2014but as higher-order\npredicates: expressions that combine directly with ordinary\npredicates to form sentences, just as ordinary predicates combine with\nnames and pronouns. In such a regimentation, we can form well-formed\nformulae like \n\n\\[x = y \\land \\text{AsTallAs}(x,y) \\land\n\\text{MoreNatural}(=, \\text{AsTallAs})\n\\]\n\n where the symbols \u2018=\u2019 and\n\u2018AsTallAs\u2019 occur without equivocation both as predicates\ntaking the variables \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(y\\)\u2019 as\narguments, and as the arguments of the higher-order predicate\n\u2018MoreNatural\u2019. In neither case are they understood as\nnames for properties, or as names at all. And in neither case is there\nanything like quotation going on: \\(`\\text{MoreNatural}(=,\n\\text{AsTallAs})\\rsquo\\) is no more about the expressions\n\u2018=\u2019 and \u2018AsTallAs\u2019 than \u2018Every man is\nmortal\u2019 is about the expressions \u2018man\u2019 and \u2018is\nmortal\u2019.\n\nIf one admits this as intelligible, one might also admit uses of\n\u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018more natural than\u2019 where they\ncombine with meaningful expressions that are not ordinary predicates\nto make sentences. For example, one might allow a comparative\nnaturalness predicate that combines with two binary sentential\noperators, making \u2018MoreNatural(and, or)\u2019 well-formed.\nAgain, this is not supposed to be a claim about the words\n\u2018and\u2019 and \u2018or\u2019. One might pronounce it as\n\u2018Conjunction is more natural than disjunction\u2019, but this\nmay be misleading, given that the English word\n\u2018conjunction\u2019 seems much more like a name than like a\nbinary sentential operator. \n\nA willingness to allow \u2018natural\u2019 to play these\nmultifarious syntactic roles is a central development in Sider\n (2011).\n (Sider signals this by using the word \u2018structural\u2019\ninstead of \u2018perfectly natural\u2019.) As well as defending the\nintelligibility and importance of questions posed in such terms, Sider\ndefends certain specific claims of the relevant sort: e.g.\u00a0that\neither Structural(and) or Structural(or); that either\nStructural(\u2203) or Structural(\u2200); that\nStructural(Structural); and that it is not the case that\nStructural(necessarily).\n\nDorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n advocate a similar flexibility about the syntax of naturalness\nclaims. They suggest that these claims should be regimented within in\na higher-order logic, where for any syntactic categories\n(\u201ctypes\u201d) \\(\\alpha_1,\\ldots ,\\alpha_n\\), there is a type\n\\(\\langle\\alpha_1,\\ldots ,\\alpha_n\\rangle\\), expressions of which can\ncombine with expressions of types \\(\\alpha_1,\\ldots ,\\alpha_n\\) to\nform sentences. Using \\(e\\) for the type of names, an ordinary monadic\npredicate is of type \\(\\langle e\\rangle\\), so a higher-order predicate\ntaking such a predicate as an argument is of type \\(\\langle\\langle\ne\\rangle\\rangle\\). Sentences (or, more generally, formulas) can be\nidentified with expressions of type \\(\\langle\\rangle\\); so binary\noperators like \\(\\wedge\\) (\u2018and\u2019) and \\(\\vee\\)\n(\u2018or\u2019) are of type\n\\(\\langle\\langle\\rangle,\\langle\\rangle\\rangle\\). The proposal is to\nintroduce, for each type \\(\\alpha\\), expressions\n\u2018PerfectlyNatural\\(_\\alpha\\)\u2019 of type\n\\(\\langle\\alpha\\rangle\\), \u2018MoreNatural\\(_\\alpha\\)\u2019 of type\n\\(\\langle\\alpha ,\\alpha\\rangle\\), and so on. We can thus formulate\nquestions like \u2018Is it the case that MoreNatural\n\\(_{\\langle\\langle\\rangle,\\langle\\rangle\\rangle}(\\text{and},\n\\text{or})\\)?\u2019 Standard higher order languages also admit\nvariables and quantifiers of all types, so we can also say things like\n\u2018\\(\\neg\\exists x^{\\langle\\langle \\rangle\n,\\langle\\rangle\\rangle}\\text{MoreNatural}_{\\langle\\langle\\rangle,\\langle\\rangle\\rangle}(x,\\wedge)?\\)\u2019\u2014\u2018No\nbinary operation is more natural than conjunction\u2019.\n\nThere are some differences between Sider\u2019s approach and this\nhigher-order approach. One is that Sider does not think of\n\u2018Structural\u2019 as ambiguous, despite its ability to\noccupy different syntactic roles. One upshot is that for him there is\njust a single question \u2018Structural(Structural)?\u2019 where a\nhigher-order approach would distinguish infinitely many:\n\u2018Structural\\(_{\\langle\\langle\ne\\rangle\\rangle}\\)(Structural\\(_{\\langle e\\rangle})\\)?\u2019,\n\u2018Structural\\(_{\\langle\\langle\\langle\ne\\rangle\\rangle\\rangle}\\)(Structural\\(_{\\langle\\langle\ne\\rangle\\rangle})\\)?\u2019, and so on. Another is that Sider allows\n\u2018Structural\u2019 to combine with linguistic items that would\nnot, on the higher-order approach, be meaningful units at all, such as\n variable-binders.[7]\n Indeed Sider suggests that we can make sense of attributions of\nstructuralness where the argument of \u2018Structural\u2019 is\nsomething like a grammatical category rather than a\nlinguistic\n expression.[8]\n Most importantly, Sider does not have higher order\nquantification, so his regimentation of \u2018Conjunction is\nperfectly natural\u2019 does not extend to claims like\n\u2018Conjunction is the only perfectly natural binary\noperator\u2019.\n3.5 Natural magnitudes\n\nThere are many properties that have to do with how massive things are:\nthey include determinate mass properties like being 17\ngrams in mass; more general properties like having mass;\nrelations between objects like being more massive than;\nrelations among properties like being a greater mass than;\nand many more. But what about mass itself? Is it one of the\naforementioned properties? Some authors have suggested that the answer\nis no: things like mass and density\u2014and\nperhaps also shape, athletic ability,\netc.\u2014belong to a sui generis ontological category of\n\u201cquantities\u201d or \u201cmagnitudes\u201d. Each of these\nitems is associated with certain values or degrees,\ne.g. three grams or three grams per cubic\ncentimeter; these may belong to some further sui generis\ncategory. An object can \u201chave\u201d a magnitude\n\u201cto\u201d a degree. But the magnitude mass is not the\nbinary relation object \\(x\\) has mass to degree \\(y\\).\n\nGiven this picture, it is natural to apply \u2018natural\u2019 to\nmagnitudes as well as properties. For example one might propose that\nmass is more natural than density. In a late paper, Lewis\n (2009)\n talks like this (calling magnitudes \u2018properties that come in\ndegrees\u2019), although he leaves it open whether they are identical\nto properties in our sense. Weatherson\n (2006),\n taking it for granted that magnitudes are not properties, argues that\nsome magnitudes are perfectly natural, and suggests that there may not\nbe any perfectly natural\n properties.[9]\n\n\nHowever, the background theory of magnitudes as sui generis entities\nremains quite underdeveloped. For example, it is unclear what entities\ncan be the \u201cvalues\u201d of a magnitude; whether there are\nanalogues for magnitudes of logical operations like conjunction and\nquantification in the realm of quantities; and whether there are\nanalogues for magnitudes of the comprehension principles\ncharacteristic of \u201cabundant\u201d conceptions of properties. It\nis thus not yet clear how much of a difference moving to a\nmagnitude-based framework would require in theorising about\nnaturalness.\n3.6 Natural kinds\n\nAnother category whose relation to classes, properties, and concepts\nis contested is that of kinds. To judge by how we talk, kinds\nseem more \u201cconcrete\u201d than properties: compare \u2018I\nused to drive that kind of car\u2019 versus \u2018I used to drive\nthat property\u2019 (see Carlson\n 1977).\n Further complicating the relationship is the fact that the notion\n\u2018natural kind\u2019 is the topic of a body of literature large\nenough to be the topic of a separate entry\n (natural kinds).\n This literature, which traces back at least to the discussion of\n\u201cKinds\u201d by Mill\n (1843),\n is guided by a set of paradigms rather different from those that\nguide the literature on natural properties. For example, following\nMill, it is widely denied that there is a natural kind to which all\nand only white things belong, on the grounds that they have\nnothing else important in common other than their color. So\neven if one identified kinds with properties, there would be a case\nfor distinguishing the senses of \u2018natural\u2019 in\n\u2018natural property\u2019 and \u2018natural kind\u2019 (see\nTobin\n 2013).\n Of course this does not rule out analysing one of the notions in\nterms of the other: for example, being a very natural kind might\nrequire being coextensive with several different sufficiently natural\nproperties that are probabilistically correlated given the actual laws\nof nature, but not necessarily equivalent (c.f. Boyd\n 1991).\n4. Naturalness and other notions\n\nLewis\n (1983)\n argues for the theoretical utility of the notion of naturalness by\nproposing an array of generalizations linking naturalness to other\ntopics, including similarity, intrinsicness, materialism, laws of\nnature, and meaning. Subsequent authors have offered competing or\ncomplementary proposals. Many proposals, like Lewis\u2019s, purport\nto \u201canalyse\u201d, or provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions for, some other property partly in terms of naturalness;\nsome purport to analyse naturalness in terms of other properties;\nothers involve other kinds of generalizations. This section will\nattempt a survey.\n4.1 Similarity\n\nIntroductions to our topic often emphasise a connection to similarity.\nWhereas any two objects, no matter how similar or dissimilar, share\ninfinitely many properties and are divided by infinitely many\nproperties, sharing of natural properties \u201cmakes for\nsimilarity\u201d (Lewis\n 1983,\n 347;\n 1986b,\n 60), while division by natural properties \u201cmakes for\ndissimilarity\u201d. These vague generalizations suggest two\nprojects: that of analysing naturalness in terms of similarity, and\nthat of analysing similarity in terms of naturalness.\n\nThe former project has important historical antecedents. Starting with\na two-place predicate intended to express a specific notion of\nsimilarity (between total experiential states), Carnap\n (1928)\n defines a \u201cquality circle\u201d\u2014roughly, a natural\nclass\u2014as a class any two members of which are similar, which is\nnot contained in any other such class. Goodman\n (1951)\n influentially objected to some consequences of this definition (see\nthe entry on\n Nelson Goodman,\n \u00a74.2): for example, it implies that whenever \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and\n\\(C\\) are quality circles, \\((A\\cap B)\\cup(B\\cap C)\\cup(C\\cap A)\\) is\ncontained in some quality circle (the \u201cdifficulty of imperfect\ncommunity\u201d). This does not seem plausibly necessarily true,\nequating \u2018quality circle\u2019 with \u2018perfectly natural\nclass\u2019. \n\nSubsequent attempts to explain naturalness in terms of resemblance\nhave used richer inputs. For example, Rodriguez-Pereyra\n (2002)\n defines \u2018property class\u2019 in terms of a three-place\npredicate \u2018\\(x\\) resembles \\(y\\) to degree \\(n\\)\u2019. Here\n\\(n\\) is, surprisingly, a natural number\u2014the intention\nis that the degree of resemblance between two objects should turn out\nto equal the total number of \u201cproperty classes\u201d that\ncontain\n both.[10]\n Rodriguez-Pereyra\u2019s conception of degrees of resemblance is\nunusual, since it conflicts with the intuitive thought that everything\nresembles itself at least as strongly as anything could\nresemble anything else. On a more popular approach, the degree of\ndissimilarity between two objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is\nrepresented by a non-negative real number \\(d(x,y)\\) satisfying the\nfollowing \u201cpseudometric space\u201d axioms: \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{i}    d(x,x) &= 0 \\\\\n\\tag{ii}   d(x,y) &= d(y,x) \\\\\n\\tag{iii}  d(x,z) &\\le d(x,y)+d(y,z).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis suggests several possible strategies for defining a notion of\nnaturalness for classes. One could take into account facts about the\n\u201cshape\u201d of a class: for example, whether it is spherical\n(such that for some \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), \\(z\\) belongs to it just in case\n\\(d(x,z)\\le d(x,y)\\)), or convex (such that whenever \\(x\\) and \\(z\\)\nbelong to it and \\(d(x,z)=d(x,y)+d(y,z)\\), \\(y\\) belongs to\n it).[11]\n One could also consider facts about its \u201csize\u201d,\ne.g.\u00a0the maximum degree of dissimilarity between any two of its\n members.[12]\n Or one could consider the extent of the gulf between a class and its\ncomplement: the minimum degree of dissimilarity between any member and\nany non-member.\n\nIf one is willing to help oneself to some notion like \u2018the\ndegree of dissimilarity between \\(x\\) as it is at world \\(w\\) and\n\\(y\\) as it is at world \\(w'\\)\u2019, one could use similar\nstrategies to analyse naturalness for properties. However, this notion\nof \u201ctransworld resemblance\u201d seems to cry out for further\nexplanation. It is also worth noting that this kind of analysis looks\ninhospitable to the idea that the description of the world in terms of\nperfectly natural properties is in any sense\n\u201ccomplete\u201d (see \u00a74.4.1 below): indeed, it would be\nrather surprising for multiple properties to be exactly tied\nfor first place on any similarity-based measure of naturalness.\n\nThe opposite project, of analysing similarity in terms of naturalness,\ncould be carried out in several ways. Assuming we are concerned with a\nrelatively intuitive notion of similarity on which everything is\nmaximally similar to itself, and on which objects can be more or less\nsimilar without sharing any perfectly natural properties, the\nprospects are best if we invoke a numerical measure of naturalness.\nGiven such a measure, one might propose the following analysis:\n\nDivision\n\nThe degree of dissimilarity between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is the sum of the\ndegrees of naturalness of all the properties that divide \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) (i.e., are instantiated by \\(x\\) but not by \\(y\\) or by \\(y\\)\nbut not by\n \\(x\\)).[13]\n\n\nA nice feature of\n Division\n is that it automatically validates the pseudometric space axioms\n(i)\u2013(iii) above. (By contrast, if we measured the degree of\nsimilarity of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) by summing the degrees of naturalness of\nthe properties shared by \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we would have to\nallow some objects\u2014namely, those that instantiate many natural\nproperties\u2014to be more similar to themselves than others.) But\nthe approach also faces several problems:\n\n\n\nIt is not obvious that there is a reasonable numerical measure of\nnaturalness on which the relevant sums are\n well-defined.[14]\n\n\n\nIt is not obvious how to reconcile Division with the evident\nvagueness and context-sensitivity of expressions like \u2018more\nsimilar than\u2019. It seems implausible that all of this variation\ncan be traced back to vagueness and context-sensitivity in \u2018more\nnatural than\u2019 in such a way that Division comes out\ntrue in all contexts. One might appeal here to quantifier domain\nrestriction: perhaps, in contexts where only psychological similarity\nmatters, Division is true so long as the universal quantifier\nover properties is understood as restricted to psychological\nproperties. However we may need more flexibility than this to allow\nboth for contexts where psychological similarity matters a lot but\nbodily similarity matters a little and for contexts where bodily\nsimilarity matters a lot and psychological similarity matters a\nlittle.\n\n\nDivision makes it hard to connect similarity to quantitative\ndifferences in the ways one might expect. Consider three triangles A,\nB, C, where A is equilateral with side length 1m; B is isosceles with\nside lengths 1m, 1m, 1.01m; and C is isosceles with side lengths 1m,\n1m, 1.1m. The paradigms we began with (and the\nsimplicity-of-definition idea, and the connections to mental and\nlinguistic content discussed\n \u00a74.7\n below) suggest that for most values of \\(x\\) other than 1, being\nisosceles with one side \\(x\\) times as long as the other two is\nmuch less natural than being equilateral. Given this, it\nlooks like A and B, being divided by being equilateral, may\nbe counted by Division as more dissimilar than triangles B\nand C are. This contrasts with a more familiar conception of\nsimilarity in this domain, on which the degree of dissimilarity\nbetween a 1,1,1 triangle and a 1,1,\\(x\\) triangle approaches 0 as\n\\(x\\) approaches 1.\n\n\nProblems arise even with continua of properties where there is no\nindependent reason to posit different degrees of naturalness. Consider\nmass. If we assign all mass-interval properties like having a mass\nbetween 100 and 105 kg positive naturalness scores, we will get\nthe disastrous result that any two objects that differ in mass are\ndissimilar to the same, infinite, degree. But if we assign them all a\nscore of zero, it seems impossible to recover the intuitive judgment\nthat objects whose masses differed by only 1% could resemble more\nclosely than any objects whose mass differed by 10% possibly could. We\nmight hope to thread the needle by saying that most mass-interval\nproperties score zero but a few (countably many) are natural enough to\nget positive scores. But this seems to require invidiously privileging\nsome units for mass over others, and will still make for\ncounterintuitive discontinuities in the similarity measure as\ndiscussed under\n (c).[15]\n\n\n\nProblem (a) is fairly specific to Division, but (b)\u2013(d)\nseem potentially challenging for other ways of cashing out the vague\nslogan \u201cnatural properties make for similarity\u201d.\n4.2 Duplication and intrinsicness\n\nOne theoretically important kind of similarity is\nduplication, or perfect intrinsic qualitative similarity: the\nrelation that would hold between two peas in a pod if it weren\u2019t\nfor all the microscopic differences in the arrangement of their\nmolecules, and perhaps holds in fact between certain pairs of hydrogen\natoms or spacetime points. Lewis\n (1986b)\n proposes essentially the following definition:\n\nDuplication\n\n\\(x\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) if and only if there is a bijective\nfunction \\(f\\) from the parts of \\(x\\) to the parts of \\(y\\), such\nthat for any any perfectly natural \\(n\\)-ary property \\(R\\) and any\nsequence \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) of parts of \\(x\\), \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\)\ninstantiate \\(R\\) just in case \\(f(x_1),\\ldots,f(x_n)\\) instantiate\n \\(R\\).[16]\n\n\nThose who deny that there are any perfectly natural properties (e.g.\non the grounds that for every property we can find a more natural one,\nor on the grounds that some magnitudes\n (\u00a73.5)\n are more natural than any properties) will presumably reject the\nright-to-left direction of\n Duplication,\n to avoid the absurd result that any two objects with equally many\nparts are duplicates. This need not, however, put paid to the program\nof defining duplication in terms of naturalness. For example, Langton\nand Lewis\n (1998)\n suggest a quite different definition in terms of \u2018more\nnatural\u2019: for details, see \u00a73.3 in the entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties.[17]\n\n\nOne worry about the left-to-right direction of\n Duplication\n is based on the fact that, under plausible assumptions, it entails\nthat duplicate objects must always have exactly the same perfectly\nnatural\n properties.[18]\n This is in tension with certain unorthodox views about perfect\nnaturalness, e.g. that specific location properties (e.g.\u00a0being\nhere) or vector properties (e.g.\u00a0moving in this\ndirection) are perfectly\n natural.[19]\n Proponents of such views might consider modifying\n Duplication\n to allow certain nontrivial permutations of perfectly natural\nproperties.\n\nDuplication is a useful relation to have a grip on. Lewis uses it in\ndefining several other things, such as determinism (a deterministic\nproposition is one that never divides possible worlds with duplicate\ninitial temporal segments; determinism is the proposition that the\nconjunction of the laws of nature is deterministic) and intrinsicness\n(a property is intrinsic just in case it never divides\nduplicates).\n\nNote that defining intrinsic properties as those that do not divide\nduplicates is hopeless unless it is combined with something like\nLewis\u2019s modal realism. Being a dog-owner is not\nintrinsic; but unless there are vast numbers of people, it is unlikely\nthat any dog-owner is a duplicate of a non-dog-owner. It will not help\nto define the intrinsic properties as those that could not\ndivide duplicates, since being a duplicate of a dog-owner is\nalso not intrinsic. A better idea is to replace the binary relation of\nduplication with a four-place relation between two objects and two\npossible worlds, in which case we can say that property \\(F\\) is\nintrinsic if and only if, whenever \\(x\\) as it is at \\(w\\) is a\nduplicate of \\(y\\) as it is at \\(w'\\), \\(x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(w\\) just\nin case \\(y\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(w'\\).\n Duplication\n can be modified to turn it into an analysis of this four-place\nrelation:\n\nCross-world Duplication\n\n\\(x\\) as it is at \\(w\\) is a duplicate of \\(y\\) as it is at \\(w'\\) if\nand only if there is a one-to-one function \\(f\\) whose domain includes\neverything that is part of \\(x\\) at \\(w\\), and whose range includes\neverything that is part of \\(y\\) at \\(w'\\), such that for any sequence\n\\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) of objects that are parts of \\(x\\) at \\(w'\\) and\nperfectly natural \\(n\\)-ary relation \\(R\\), \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\)\ninstantiate \\(R\\) at \\(w\\) if and only if \\(f(x_1),\\ldots,f(x_n)\\)\ninstantiate \\(R\\) at\n \\(w'\\).[20]\n\n\nOne objection to this package concerns non-qualitative\nproperties: properties like being identical to Obama and\nhaving Obama as a part are not counted as intrinsic.\nFrancescotti\n (1999),\n Eddon\n (2011),\n and others argue that this is\n wrong.[21]\n Another objection is that the analysis does not allow an intrinsic\nproperty to be necessarily coextensive with an extrinsic one. Those\nwho hold that there are distinct but necessarily extensive qualitative\nproperties may prefer a more discriminating account of intrinsicness\non which, for example, being spherical is intrinsic while\nbeing spherical and either a home-owner or not a home-owner\nis\n not.[22]\n\n4.3 Qualitative indiscernibility and qualitativeness\n\nAnother theoretically important specialised similarity relation is\nqualitative indiscernibility. Qualitative indiscernibility is\nmore demanding than duplication: whereas duplicates can differ\nextrinsically, qualitatively indiscernible objects must also match in\ntheir relations to their environments, so that in a non-symmetric\nuniverse, no two things are qualitatively indiscernible.\n\nDuplication\n can be turned into an analysis of qualitative indiscernibility by\nincluding all objects, not just the parts of the relevant objects\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\), in the domain of the function \\(f\\):\n\nIndiscernibility\n\n\\(x\\) is qualitatively indiscernible from \\(y\\) if and only if there\nis a one-to-one, onto function \\(f\\) whose domain and range include\nall objects, such that \\(f(x)=y\\), and for any sequence \\(x_1,\\ldots\n,x_n\\) of objects and any perfectly natural \\(n\\)-ary property \\(R\\),\n\\(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\) instantiate \\(R\\) just in case \\(f(x_1),\\ldots\n,f(x_n)\\) instantiate \\(R\\). \n\nOne immediate worry about the left-to-right direction of\n Indiscernibility\n is that according to standard set theory there are no\nfunctions whose domain and range include all objects (assuming sets\ncount as\n \u201cobjects\u201d).[23]\n There are various possible ways around this problem. For example, one\nmight replace the quantifier over \u201cfunctions\u201d with a\nplural quantifier over ordered pairs, or a higher-order quantifier\nbinding a variable in dyadic predicate\n position.[24]\n\n\nOne significant worry about the right-to-left direction of\n Indiscernibility\n arises for those who posit higher-order perfectly natural\nproperties, whose instances are properties or propositions rather than\nobjects. For example, someone who posited that thinking was a\nperfectly natural relation between people and propositions, modally\nindependent of the perfectly natural properties instantiated only by\nobjects, one would likely want to rule out the possibility that there\nare qualitatively indiscernible people \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(x\\)\nthinks that \\(x\\) is hungry, \\(y\\) does not think that \\(y\\) is\nhungry.\n Indiscernibility\n does not obviously do this. \n\nLewis\n (1986b)\n briefly suggests a quite different analysis of qualitative\nindiscernibility: \\(x\\) is qualitatively indiscernible from \\(y\\) just\nin case \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) share the same \u201csomewhat natural\u201d\n properties.[25]\n If we take the \u201csomewhat natural\u201d properties to be those\nwith finite definitions in terms of perfectly natural properties,\nsharing of these properties will follow from indiscernibility as\ndefined by\n Indiscernibility;\n however the converse implication can fail when there are infinitely\nmany objects.\n\nOnce we have the notion of qualitative indiscernibility, we can use it\nto analyse the notion of a qualitative property. Intuitively,\na qualitative property is one that is not \u201cabout\u201d any\nindividual: admiring a famous philosopher is qualitative,\nwhile admiring David Lewis is not. For Lewis, a monadic\nproperty \\(F\\) is qualitative if and only if whenever \\(x\\) is\nqualitatively indiscernible from \\(y\\), \\(x\\) has \\(F\\) just in case\n\\(y\\) has \\(F\\). As in the case of duplication, this analysis is\ntenable only given a super-abundant ontology like Lewis\u2019s.\nNon-modal realists may, however, adapt the idea by using a\nworld-relativised relation of qualitative indiscernibility, whose\ndefinition stands to\n Indiscernibility\n as\n Cross-World Duplication\n stands to\n Duplication.[26]\n\n\nLike the definition of intrinsicness in terms of duplication, the\ndefinition of qualitativeness in terms of qualitative indiscernibility\nfits most naturally with a view where necessarily equivalent\nproperties are always identical, since it will not allow us to say,\ne.g., that being red is qualitative but being red and\neither admiring or not admiring Lewis is non-qualitative. For\nproponents of finer-grained theories of properties who want to make\nsuch distinctions, the strategy of analysing qualitativeness in terms\nof qualitative indiscernibility seems unpromising. But the project of\nanalysing qualitativeness in terms of perfect naturalness remains on\nthe table. For example, invoking the notion of \u201cfull\ndefinability\u201d discussed in\n \u00a74.10\n below, one might define a qualitative property as one fully definable\nfrom perfectly natural\n properties.[27]\n\n\nThese analyses have noteworthy consequences that could be maintained\neven if the project of analysing \u2018qualitative\u2019 were given\nup. One is that all perfectly natural properties are qualitative.\nAnother is that all qualitative properties supervene on the perfectly\nnatural properties, in the following sense:\n\nQualitative Supervenience\n\nIf \\(f\\) is a bijection from the objects existing at \\(w\\) to the\nobjects existing at \\(w'\\) such that for every perfectly natural\n\\(n\\)-ary property \\(R\\) and objects \\(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\), \\(x_1,\\ldots\n,x_n\\) instantiate \\(R\\) at \\(w_1\\) iff \\(f(x_1),\\ldots ,f(x_n)\\)\ninstantiate \\(R\\) at \\(w_2\\), then for every qualitative \\(m\\)-ary\nproperty \\(S\\) and objects \\(y_1,\\ldots ,y_m\\), \\(y_1,\\ldots ,y_m\\)\ninstantiate \\(S\\) at \\(w_1\\) iff \\(f(y_1),\\ldots ,f(y_m)\\) instantiate\n\\(S\\) at\n \\(w_2\\).[28]\n\n\nQualitative Supervenience\n will of course not be acceptable to those who deny that there are any\nperfectly natural properties. Some specific putative counterexamples\nto Qualitative Supervenience have also been offered. For\nexample, Dasgupta\n (2013)\n suggests that is possible for the same objects to instantiate the\nsame fundamental properties even while everything is twice as massive\nas it in fact is. Since Dasgupta also seems to assume that properties\nlike being one kilogram in mass to be qualitative, these\npossibilities seem to involve a failure of\n Qualitative Supervenience.[29]\n\n4.4 Modality\n4.4.1 Completeness\n\nLewis took it as axiomatic that \u201ctruth is supervenient on\nbeing\u201d, and explained this slogan\u2014borrowed from Bigelow\n (1988)\u2014as\n follows:\n\n\nIf two possible worlds are discernible in any way at all, it must be\nbecause they differ in what things there are in them, or in how those\nthings are. And \"how things are\" is fully given by the fundamental,\nperfectly natural, properties and relations that those things\ninstantiate.\n\n\nSpelling this out, we get: \n\nTSB\n\nFor any possible worlds \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\), if \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\) agree as\nregards what things there are, and for any \\(n\\), any perfectly\nnatural \\(n\\)-ary property \\(R\\), and any \\(n\\) objects\n\\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) that exist at \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\), the proposition\nthat \\(R(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is true at \\(w\\) if and only if it is true\nat \\(w'\\), then exactly the same propositions are true at \\(w\\) and\n \\(w'\\).[30]\n\n\nWe can get across the same idea without mentioning possible worlds:\n\n\nNecessarily, every true proposition is metaphysically necessitated by\nsome collection of true propositions each of which is either (a) the\nproposition that \\(R(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) or \\(\u00acR(x_1,\\ldots\n,x_n)\\), for some perfectly natural \\(R\\) and objects \\(x_1,\\ldots\n,x_n\\) are any objects; (b) the proposition that \\(\\exists y(y=x)\\),\nfor some object \\(x\\), or (c) the proposition that every object is one\nof \\(xx\\), where \\(xx\\) are all the objects there\n are.[31]\n\n\nTSB\n follows from\n Qualitative Supervenience\n (see\n \u00a74.3)\n together with a less controversial principle we might dub\n\u2018Truth Supervenes on the Qualitative\u2019, derived from\n TSB\n by replacing \u2018perfectly natural\u2019 with\n\u2018qualitative\u2019. It is thus unsurprising that putative\ncounterexamples to\n Qualitative Supervenience\n extend to\n TSB.\n For example, if one took being left-handed to be a\nqualitative property that need not be preserved by bijections that\npreserve perfectly natural properties, one might plausibly think that\nworlds could agree on which objects there are and which perfectly\nnatural properties they instantiate without agreeing on which ones are\nleft-handed. Similarly, if one posits higher-order perfectly natural\nproperties which do not supervene on the first-order ones, one should\nhave doubts about\n TSB,\n assuming one interprets\n TSB\u2019s\n talk of \u201cobjects\u201d in a way that does not include objects.\nHowever in that case one might hold on to a variant of\n TSB\n that gives the same status to all propositions \\(R(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)\\)\nwhere \\(R\\) is perfectly natural (of whatever type) and\n\\(X_1,\\ldots,X_n\\) are of the right types to be arguments to \\(R\\).\n\n\nTSB\n can be understood as an attempt to pin down the inchoate thought that\nthe description of the world in terms of perfectly natural properties\nis \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201cexhaustive\u201d. Sider\n (2011)\n argues that\n TSB\n fails to capture the intuitive idea of completeness, primarily on the\ngrounds that \u2018it imposes no meaningful requirement of\ncompleteness for necessary truths\u2019.\n \u00a74.10\n and\n \u00a74.11\n below will consider some different strategies for capturing the\nthought, which are plausibly taken to be stronger than\n TSB.\n Sider\u2019s own preference is to cash out the thought in a\nmetalinguistic way, as the thesis that \u201cevery sentence that\ncontains expressions that do not carve at the joints has a\nmetaphysical semantics\u201d. Unfortunately there is no space to\nexplain the novel conception of \u201cmetaphysical semantics\u201d\nSider is appealing to; however it is worth mentioning that Sider does\nnot take his thesis about metaphysical semantics to imply\n TSB.\n4.4.2 Independence\n\nAccording to Lewis\n (1986b:\n 60), \u201cthere are only just enough [perfectly natural properties]\nto characterise things completely and without redundancy\u201d. This\nremark suggests that the perfectly natural properties constitute a\nminimal supervenience base for all truths: if \\(R\\) is a\nperfectly natural property, the result of replacing \u2018perfectly\nnatural property\u2019 with \u2018perfectly natural property distinct\nfrom \\(R\\)\u2019 in\n TSB\n and/or\n Qualitative Supervenience\n is\n false.[32]\n Of course one way for this to be true would be for\n TSB/Qualitative Supervenience\n to already be false. But there is an idea in the vicinity that is\nlogically independent of\n TSB\n and\n Qualitative Supervenience,\n namely that no perfectly natural property supervenes on all the\nrest. If we take the relevant sense of \u2018supervene\u2019 to\nbe the one in play in\n Qualitative Supervenience,\n this amounts to: \n\nMinimality\n\nFor each perfectly natural \\(n\\)-ary property \\(R\\), there are\npossible worlds \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\), objects \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) existing\nat \\(w\\), and a bijection \\(f\\) from objects existing at \\(w\\) to\nobjects existing at \\(w'\\) such that \\(R(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) at \\(w\\),\nnot \\(R(f(x_1),\\ldots,f(x_n))\\) at \\(w'\\), and for every perfectly\nnatural \\(m\\)-ary property \\(S\\) distinct from \\(R\\) and objects\n\\(y_1,\\ldots,y_m\\) existing at \\(w\\), \\(S(y_1,\\ldots,y_m)\\) at \\(w\\)\nif and only if \\(S(f(y_1),\\ldots,f(y_m))\\) at \\(w'\\).\n\nIf we take the relevant sense of \u2018supervene\u2019 to be the one\nin play in\n TSB,\n we get something a bit stronger, where the worlds \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\)\nare required to be ones at which the same objects exist and the\nfunction \\(f\\) is required to map every object to itself. \n\nMinimality\n entails that if a binary relation \\(R\\) is perfectly natural, its\nconverse\u2014being an \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that\n\\(R(y,x)\\)\u2014is not also perfectly natural. This seems oddly\narbitrary: it is tempting to think that, instead, converse relations\nare always equally natural. One could avoid this objection by\nweakening\n Minimality,\n replacing \u2018distinct from \\(R\\)\u2019 with \u2018distinct from\n\\(R\\) and its converse\u2019, or more generally \u2018distinct from\nall of the permutations of \\(R\\)\u2019. More ambitiously,\none could develop a theory of \u201cneutral\u201d relations (Fine\n 2000),\n understood as entities for which distinctions like the one between a\nrelation and its converse does not arise, and treat \u2018perfectly\nnatural\u2019 as a predicate of neutral relations.\n\nMinimality\n also implies that the negation of a perfectly natural\nproperty is never perfectly natural. This does not so obviously raise\nworries about arbitrariness. Nevertheless, the relation between a\nrelation and its negation is structurally quite similar to the\nrelation between a relation and its converse\u2014both seem to\ninvolve a kind of \u201cinterdefinability\u201d\u2014so there are\nsome attractions to saying that the negation of a perfectly natural\nproperty is always perfectly natural, and more generally that the\nnegation of any property is equal to it in naturalness. This has been\nsuggested by Plate\n (2016)\n and Dorr\n (2016).[33]\n\n\nA different kind of putative counterexample to\n Minimality\n involves perfectly natural properties which are \u201crigid\u201d\nin the sense that whatever instantiates or fails to instantiate them\ndoes so necessarily. If\n TSB\n is true and \\(F\\) is rigid,\n TSB\n remains true when \u2018perfectly natural property\u2019 is\nreplaced by \u2018perfectly natural property distinct from\n\\(F\\)\u2019. For example, if one held that every electron is\nnecessarily an electron (if it exists) and that every non-electron is\nnecessarily not an electron (if it exists), minimality would rule out\nclaiming that being an electron is perfectly natural. Eddon\n (2013)\n argues that certain rigid relations among properties are\nperfectly natural, and thus make trouble for minimality: one of her\nexamples is the three-place being the sum of relation that\nholds, for example, between the determinate mass properties being\nexactly 5kg in mass, being exactly 7kg in mass, and\nbeing exactly 12kg in mass.\n\nFinally, some have argued against\n Minimality\n on the grounds that certain \u201chigher-level\u201d properties are\nperfectly natural, despite supervening on perfectly natural\n\u201clower-level\u201d properties. For example, Bennett\n (2017)\n argues that the property of being a \u201cschmoton\u201d\u2014a\ncertain kind of complex particle\u2014might be perfectly natural,\ndespite supervening on other perfectly natural properties: her\nargument is based on a list of criteria she takes to be jointly\nsufficient for perfect naturalness, including \u201cfiguring in\nfundamental laws\u201d and being such that any two of one\u2019s\ninstances are\n duplicates.[34]\n\n\nMinimality\n allows for a wide variety of interesting modal connections within the\nclass of perfectly natural properties, so long as they do not take the\nspecific form of a supervenience claim. Many authors have been\nattracted towards much more sweeping claims of modal independence,\noften inspired by the Humean slogan \u201cno necessary connections\nbetween distinct existences\u201d. Lewis\n (1986b)\n defends a \u201cprinciple of recombination\u201d (see the entry on\n possible worlds),\n which entails, for example, that any two possibly-instantiated\nconjunctions of perfectly natural properties are possibly instantiated\nin the same world. Depending on how the principle is precisified, it\nmay also entail that for any two possibly-instantiated conjunctions of\nperfectly natural monadic properties \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) and any perfectly\nnatural binary relation \\(R\\) it is possible that an instance of \\(F\\)\nbears \\(R\\) to an instance of\n \\(G\\).[35]\n Some particularly far-reaching claims of this sort go by the name of\n\u201ccombinatorialism\u201d: the idea is that all logically\npossible patterns in which any properties might be distributed are\npossibly instantiated by any given perfectly natural\n properties.[36]\n For example, since it is logically possible for there to be a monadic\nproperty with exactly seven instances and a binary relation that holds\nbetween any two of those instances, each perfectly natural property\n\\(F\\) and perfectly natural binary relation \\(R\\) are such that it is\nmetaphysically possible for \\(F\\) to have exactly seven instances and\n\\(R\\) to hold between any two of\n them.[37]\n\n\nIf some kind of combinatorialism is true, it could be a powerful tool\nfor figuring out whether properties are perfectly natural, since many\ncollections of properties that might otherwise seem good candidates to\nbe perfectly natural seem to be involved in the kinds of necessary\nconnections which, according to combinatorialism, never obtain among\nperfectly natural properties. The worry for those who want to use\narguments like this to eliminate certain candidate collections of\nperfectly natural properties is that all the otherwise\nacceptable candidate collections might turn out to involved in such\napparent necessary connections. If so we will face a choice between\ngiving up combinatorialism and rejecting the relevant prima facie\nmodal judgments. To illustrate the difficulties, we can return to the\nexample of mass. Insofar as one takes physics as a guide to the\nperfectly natural, there is pressure to think that some perfectly\nnatural properties have to do with mass. There are a great many\npossible candidates, including:\n\n Maximally specific monadic mass properties of objects, like\nhaving a mass of 3.12\n grams[38]\n Less specific monadic mass properties of objects, like having\na mass between 3.12 and 4.03 grams, or just having mass\n(Wilson\n 2012)\n Binary relations between objects and real numbers, like being\nthe mass in grams of or being the mass in kilograms\nof\n More-than-two place relations between objects and numbers, like\nthe \u201cmass ratio\u201d relation, \\(x\\) is \\(n\\) times as\nmassive as \\(y\\) \n Binary relations among objects, like being the same mass\nas, being greater in mass than, being 3.12 times as\nmassive as, or being between 3.12 and 4.03 times as massive\nas. \n More-than-two place relations among objects, like \\(z\\) is as\nmassive as \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) put together, \\(z\\) is\nintermediate between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in mass, or \\(w\\) and\n\\(z\\) stand in the same mass-ratio as \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) \n Relations among properties, like F is a maximally specific\nmass property that is the sum of maximally specific mass properties G\nand H (see Mundy\n 1987,\n Eddon\n 2013).\n Relations linking mass to other scales, like the mass of\n\\(x\\) equals the distance between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) in units where the\nspeed of light and Newton\u2019s gravitational constant are both\n 1.[39]\n\n\n\nWithin each of the candidate families, one can formulate certain laws\nthat might plausibly be claimed to be metaphysically necessary. For\nexample, it is tempting to suppose that it would be metaphysically\n(rather than merely nomically) impossible for an object to be both one\ngram in mass and two grams in mass, or for one object to be both equal\nin mass to another and twice as massive as it. But if we combine all\nthese judgments with combinatorialism, we will have to deny that any\nof the families we have considered consists entirely of perfectly\nnatural\n properties.[40]\n This is not out of the question: one can imagine many ways in which\nmass-theoretic properties might supervene on perfectly natural\nproperties we do not yet have words for, in a manner consistent with\nthe relevant modal judgments. However, precisely because there are so\nmany ways this might be achieved, this response threatens to lead to a\nsort of scepticism about our ability to know what the perfectly\nnatural properties are, or how the properties we have words for\nsupervene on them. Combinatorialists thus have reason to be open to\nthe idea that some of the relevant laws might turn out, surprisingly,\nto be metaphysically contingent (though they may still be nomologcally\nnecessary). \n4.5 Universals and tropes\n\nArmstrong\n (1978)\n developed an influential theory of \u201cuniversals\u201d (a\ncategory he subdivides into properties and relations) which was\ndistinctive for its emphasis on the idea that universals are\n\u201csparse\u201d by comparison with predicates: for example,\nArmstrong refuses to posit disjunctions of universals. Lewis\n (1999,\n 1) credits Armstrong with convincing him that the concept of\nnaturalness is \u201ccommonsensical and serviceable\u201d. Lewis is\nopen to a view that posits Armstrong-style universals in addition to\nproperties and relations conceived of as \u201cabundant\u201d, and\nanalyses \u2018perfectly natural property\u2019 as \u2018property\ncorresponding to some universal\u2019, i.e.\u00a0as \u2018property\nthat is the property of instantiating \\(u\\) for some\nuniversal \\(u\\)\u2019. \n\nThis analysis has some surprising consequences when combined with\ncertain other commitments of Armstrong\u2019s view. For example,\nArmstrong holds that any two universals have a conjunction, which he\nidentifies with their mereological fusion. Given the proposed\nanalysis, this entails that the conjunction of any two perfectly\nnatural properties is itself perfectly\n natural.[41]\n This conflicts with the claim that no perfectly natural property\nsupervenes on all the rest. If one wanted to hold on to that claim,\none might instead analyse \u2018perfectly natural property\u2019 as\n\u2018property corresponding to some mereologically simple\n universal\u2019.[42]\n Note however that for Armstrong it is an open question whether there\nare any mereologically simple universals, and thus whether the\nproperties corresponding to mereologically simple universals form a\nsupervenience base for everything.\n\nArmstrong also posits a wide array of \u201cstructural\u201d\nuniversals: for example, given any universal property \\(u_1\\) and\nbinary universal relation \\(u_2\\), Armstrong would hold that if there\nare any fusions of two non-overlapping objects individually\ninstantiating \\(u_1\\) and jointly instantiating \\(u_2\\), there is a\nuniversal \\(u_3\\) that is necessarily instantiated by all and only\nsuch fusions. If the perfectly natural properties are those that\ncorrespond to universals, this view will lead to a great profusion of\nperfectly natural properties. This fits poorly with intuitive\njudgments of relative naturalness like those elicited by our initial\nexamples, and threatens to disrupt several of the theoretical roles\nfor naturalness (Sider\n 1995,\n 3). Lewis\n (1986a)\n argues (not on those grounds) that theorists of universals should not\nposit structural universals.\n\nLewis was also open to the program of analysing naturalness in terms\nof tropes\u2014\u201cparticularised property\ninstances\u201d like Socrates\u2019 paleness or\nAntony\u2019s love of Cleopatra (see the entry on\n tropes).\n Lewis suggests that given a \u201csparse\u201d theory of tropes\n(which would deny the existence of tropes like Socrates\u2019s\nbeing either pale or flushed) and a modal realist ontology, one\ncould define a perfectly natural property as one such that, for some\nmaximal set of duplicate tropes, its instances are exactly the things\nthat instantiate some member of that set (in the sense of\n\u2018instantiate\u2019 on which Socrates instantiates\nSocrates\u2019 paleness). To avoid circularity,\n\u2018duplicate\u2019 here had better not be analysed in terms of\nsharing of perfectly natural properties. By contrast with the case of\nuniversals, it is not so easy for opponents of Lewisian modal realism\nto take over this account. The most straightforward approach would\nreplace the dyadic \u2018duplicate\u2019 with a four-place predicate\n\u2018\\(t_1\\) in \\(w_1\\) is a duplicate of \\(t_2\\) in \\(w_2\\)\u2019;\nbut treating this as primitive seems even more unsatisfactory than\ntreating the dyadic \u2018duplicate\u2019 as primitive.\n4.6 Laws of nature\n\nOne of Lewis\u2019s signature applications of the notion of\nnaturalness is in the analysis of the notion of a law of\nnature, a notion of great importance for the philosophy of\nscience and for the theory of causation and counterfactuals. In brief,\nLewis\u2019s proposal is that it is a law of nature that \\(P\\) just\nin case the proposition that \\(P\\) belongs to every \u201cbest\nsystem\u201d, where a system is a set of true propositions closed\nunder necessitation, and the \u201cgoodness\u201d of a system is a\ncombination of two factors: simplicity and\n strength.[43]\n The relevant notion of simplicity can, according to Lewis, be\nunderstood in terms of\n naturalness.[44]\n The idea is that the simplicity of a system is a matter of the\nsyntactic simplicity of the its simplest axiomatisation,\nwhere an axiomatisation of a system is a set of sentences which\nexpress propositions which jointly entail exactly the propositions in\nthe system, on some interpretation where their non-logical constants\nall stand for perfectly natural\n properties.[45]\n\n\nNote that, given that Lewis also analyses relative naturalness in\nterms of perfect naturalness and syntactic simplicity, he could just\nas well have identified the degree of simplicity of a system with the\ndegree of naturalness of the strongest proposition in the system\n(i.e.\u00a0the conjunction of all the elements of the system). This\nversion of the account may be preferable to those who reject the\nprogram of analysing relative naturalness in terms of perfect\nnaturalness.\n\nFor discussion of the motivations for this \u201cbest system\u201d\nanalysis and its discontents, see the entry on\n laws of nature.\n Especially noteworthy here are objections which specifically target\nthe role of naturalness in the analysis. The most prominent\nsuch objection (van Fraassen\n 1989;\n Loewer\n (2007);\n Cohen and Callender\n 2009)\n is that the account will make it impossible to know what the laws\nare, because it will allow for the possibility that even scientists\nwho arrive at true theories by impeccable reasoning nevertheless\ngo wrong in taking the axioms of these theories to be laws,\nbecause they are mistaken in thinking that the properties expressed by the\nbasic predicates of these theories are highly natural. This is a hard\nobjection to make stick, since the form of inference involved \u2014\nfrom the possibility of error about some question to the conclusion\nthat we are not in a position to know the answer to that question\n\u2014 leads, when generalized, to a rampant scepticism.\nNon-sceptical epistemologists tend to think that possibilities of\nerror need to meet some further condition of \u201ccloseness\u201d\nor \u201crelevance\u201d in order to undermine knowledge; but it is\nunclear why one would think that this condition is met in the present\ncase. As we will see in\n \u00a74.7\n below, natural properties are widely held to be easier to refer to,\nceteris paribus. So, arguably, a situation where people ended up with\ntrue scientific theories stated in a language whose basic predicates\nwere too unnatural for the axioms to meet the bar for lawhood would\nhave to be quite remote and unusual.\n\nIf one rejects not just the details but the general program of\nanalysing lawhood in terms of naturalness, one might instead consider\nan analysis of naturalness in terms of lawhood: \u201cnatural\nproperties are the ones that figure in laws of nature\u201d (Lewis\n 1983,\n 344). (If one is analysing perfect naturalness, one might\nwant to specify that the laws should be \u201cbasic\u201d rather\nthan \u201cderived\u201d.) A central challenge for working out this\nprogram is to explain what \u2018figure in\u2019 means. To get\nanything like the desired extension for \u2018natural\u2019, we need\nan extremely fine-grained theory of propositions. For example, unless\nwe are comfortable with the consequence that being either\nnon-\\(F\\) or \\(G\\) is perfectly natural whenever the proposition\nthat everything \\(F\\) is \\(G\\) is a law, we will need to deny that\nthat property \u201cfigures in\u201d that proposition. This will\nplausibly require denying that the property is identical to the\nproposition that everything is either non-\\(F\\) or \\(G\\), and denying\nthat the latter proposition is a law despite its necessary equivalence\nto the former. As we will see in\n \u00a74.10\n below, there are formidable obstacles to developing a consistent\ntheory of properties and propositions that is fine-grained in the\nneeded\n ways.[46]\n The thesis that only perfectly natural properties \u201cfigure\nin\u201d (basic) laws of nature also faces other objections. For\nexample, Hicks and Schaffer\n (2017)\n argue against it on the grounds that, for example, acceleration\nfigures in a basic law, namely \\(F=ma\\), but is not perfectly\n natural.[47]\n\n4.7 Mental and linguistic content\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive of the roles naturalness plays for Lewis\nis the theory of mental and linguistic content. This role is sometimes\ngestured at by saying that natural properties are \u201creference\nmagnets\u201d (an expression borrowed from Hodes\n 1984):\n the more natural a property it is, the easier it is for thinkers to\nend up referring to it (or expressing it or thinking about it).\nReference to natural properties is something that happens \u201cby\ndefault\u201d; the less natural a property is, the more specific and\nfinely-tuned the conditions required to refer to it.\n\nThe most widely-discussed way of fleshing out this picture takes the\nform of a theory of linguistic meaning which Lewis\n (1983, 1984) presents as a sort\nof toy theory, not really true but close enough to the truth for certain dialectical purposes.\n This theory takes the form of an account of what it is for an\ninterpretation function to be admissible\n(\u201ccorrect\u201d, \u201cintended\u201d) for a given\npopulation. An interpretation function is a mapping from linguistic\nexpressions to semantic values of appropriate kinds (e.g. mapping\npredicates to properties and sentences to propositions, or to\nfunctions from contexts to propositions). According to the account, an\ninterpretation function is admissible for a population just in case it\nachieves the best overall balance of \u201cuse\u201d and\n\u201celigibility\u201d. An interpretation function\u2019s\n\u201cuse\u201d (or \u201ccharity\u201d) score is higher the more it maps sentences that\nmembers of that population are strongly and stably disposed to assert to true\npropositions. An interpretation function\u2019s\n\u201celigibility\u201d score is higher the more natural the\nsemantic values it assigns to words (and the simpler its rules for\nassigning semantic values to complex expressions). Sometimes there\nwill be ties for first place, so that multiple interpretation\nfunctions will be admissible for a population. In such cases\u2014and\nperhaps also in cases of near-ties\u2014the population\u2019s\nlanguage contains semantic\n indeterminacy.[48]\n\n\nLewis\u2019s reason for focusing on this toy theory involves a debate\nwith Putnam\n (1980).\n Putnam had argued that the only admissible interpretations of a\npopulation in possession of an \u201cempirically ideal\u201d theory\nare interpretations under which that theory is true (see entry\n challenges to metaphysical realism,\n \u00a73.5). As Lewis reconstructs Putnam\u2019s argument, his\npremise is a theory similar to the toy theory except that\n\u201cuse\u201d is the only admissibility-determining factor. Lewis\noffers the use-plus-eligibility theory as a minimal fix, and as an illustration of the\nway in which the concept of naturalness can be a helpful resource in\nformulating reductive theories of content which avoid strange\n consequences.[49]\n\nLewis\u2019s actual theory of content is more complex, and has to be\nreconstructed from several sources. It has three stages, in each of\nwhich naturalness plays some role. The first is an account of what it\nis for a person to have certain beliefs and desires, or to be more\nexact, a certain credence function (mapping properties to real numbers\nin the unit interval) and valuation function (mapping maximally\nspecific properties to real\n numbers).[50]\n The second is an account of what it is for a certain\n\u201cLanguage\u201d (function from sentences to propositions) to be\n\u201cused by\u201d (admissible for) a given population. The third\nstage extends the second stage to interpretation-functions that map\narbitrary expressions (not just sentences) to semantic values of the\nappropriate type. At each stage, the resources employed include those\nanalysed at the previous stage.\n\nLewis\n (1983)\n presents the following account of the first stage: for \\(C\\) and\n\\(V\\) to be, respectively, the prior credence and value function of a\ncertain agent \\(a\\) is for \\(C\\) to be a function from properties to\nreal numbers in the unit interval, and \\(V\\) to be a function from\nmaximally specific properties to real numbers, which together achieve\nan optimal balance of fit\u2014being such that \\(a\\) is\ndisposed, given evidence \\(E\\), to perform some action with a maximal\nexpected value of \\(V\\) in \\(C(\\bullet\\mid E)\\)\u2014and certain\nother desiderata. One of these other desiderata (and the only one\nLewis mentions) is eligibility: \u201cthe properties the subject\nsupposedly believes or desires or intends himself to have\u201d\nshould not be too severely unnatural (1992: 375). A difficulty with\nthis formulation is that it is not obvious how to extract \u201cthe\nproperties the subject supposedly believes or desires or intends\nhimself to have\u201d from a given \\(C\\) and \\(V\\). After all, any\n\\(C\\) that obeys the axioms of the probability calculus will have to\nassign values close to 1 to properties expressed by arbitrarily long\nformulae (Dorr and Hawthorne\n 2013,\n 28; Schwarz\n 2014,\n 25). Also, insofar as \u201cfit\u201d is just a matter of the\nsubject\u2019s behavioural dispositions, the account requires\nrevision in the light of the anti-behaviourist views expressed in\nLewis\u2019s other writings on the philosophy of mind, for example\nLewis\n 1980.[51]\n\n\nAt the second stage (sentence-level linguistic meaning), Lewis\n (1969;\n 1975) had developed an analysis on which a Language is used\nby a population just in case certain conventions prevail in\nthat population, for example a convention not to utter a sentence\nunless one believes the proposition to which it is mapped by that\nLanguage; semantic indeterminacy arises when the conventions are less than fully specific. Claims about conventions were in turn analysed in terms of\npatterns of credences and preferences among the members of the\npopulation. At the third stage (subsentential meaning), Lewis\n (1975)\n proposed that an interpretation function (or \u201cgrammar\u201d)\nis admissible for a population just in case it is a \u201cbest\u201d\ninterpretation whose restriction to sentences is a Language the\npopulation uses. This paper suggests that the relevant notion of\n\u201cbestness\u201d may be lacking in clarity and objectivity, and\nthat there will typically be many different best grammars, with the\nresult that semantic indeterminacy at the subsentential level is\npervasive. After embracing naturalness in Lewis\n 1983,\n Lewis would presumably have cashed out the \u201cbestness\u201d\nrelevant for the third stage in naturalness-theoretic terms, and\nconsequently been less pessimistic about this part of the program, although\nhe never spells this out explicitly.\nLewis (1992)\n also modifies his account of the second stage, appealing to\nnaturalness to address a worry raised by Hawthorne\n (1990).\n The worry was that the original theory would assign incorrect\ninterpretations to certain sentences where\u2014e.g. because they are\ntoo long\u2014hearing someone assert them would not tend to increase\nhearers\u2019 confidence in the proposition that is in fact the\ncorrect interpretation. The fix gives some admissibility-constituting\nweight to eligibility (naturalness), to allow for extrapolation from\nthe core cases covered by the convention-constituting pattern of\ncredences and preferences.[52]\n\nThe final package at stages two and three is thus structurally similar\nto the toy \u201ccharity plus eligibility\u201d theory, in that admissibility of an interpretation for a\npopulation is a matter of achieving the best overall score on several\nfactors, one of which is eligibility; the key difference is that the\nother factor is a matter not of mapping sentences people are disposed to accept to\ntruths, but rather of mapping all sentences, accepted or not, to propositions for which the\nappropriate conventions prevail. The final package also plausibly yields\nmany of the characteristic predictions of the toy theory, e.g. that we should \nexpect widespread semantic indeterminacy in domains where no\ncandidate meaning is much more natural than the rest (see, e.g., Sider 2001).[53]\n  On the other hand, some prominent\nobjections to the toy theory do not carry over to the final package.\nFor example, Hawthorne\n (2007),\n picking up on a case due to Williams\n (2007a),\n points out that the toy theory entails that it would be very easy for\nan Earth-bound population to end up speaking a language all of whose\nnames denote things on some distant planet, since if the planet was a\nsufficiently good match for Earth as we take it to be, such an\ninterpretation could do better on the score of charity than an\nEarth-centric one, without any sacrifice in eligibility. But in the\nfinal package, the shifted interpretation can easily be rejected on\nthe grounds that we do not use the Language it determines, since we do\nnot have, or expect one another to have, specific beliefs about how\nthings are on distant planets. This is true in turn because some\nrelations we bear to \\(\\langle C,V\\rangle\\) pairs where \\(C\\) is\nopinionated about how things are nearby and \\(V\\) cares about such\nthings are more natural than any relations we bear to pairs that are\nunopinionated and indifferent about nearby matters but opinionated and\nconcerned about distant planets.\n\nThe rich body of theory just described has been highly\ncontroversial, both in detail and in its overall\n architecture.[54]\n However, the general thought that more natural properties are,\nceteris paribus, easier to refer to than less natural properties can\nbe considered separately from any program for analysing the notions of\nmental or linguistic content. Looking for a relatively noncommittal\nthesis in this vicinity, Dorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n suggest cashing out \u2018easy to refer to\u2019 in terms of a\nphysical measure over nomic possibilities, of the sort that features\nin sciences like statistical mechanics (for more details see Dorr and\nHawthorne\n 2014).\n The thought is that ceteris paribus, the more natural a property is,\nthe greater the measure of the set of nomically possible worlds where\nit is referred to (or where it is determinately referred to, or\nthought about, or something like that). For example: if there are\nintelligent beings elsewhere in the universe, there is a far greater\nchance that they have a word that means triangle than that\nthey have a word that means three-to-five sided figure none of\nwhose sides is more than one and half times as long as any other.\nThis generalization is not tied up with any general theory of mental\nor linguistic content, although it does rest on the assumption that\nmental and semantic facts nomically supervene on physical\n facts.[55]\n\n4.8 Ampliative inference\n\nGoodman\n (1954)\n noticed an epistemologically interesting contrast between the\nproposition that all emeralds are green and the proposition that all\nemeralds are grue (where \u2018grue\u2019 was defined to mean\n\u2018either green and observed before \\(t\\) or blue and not observed\nbefore \\(t\\)\u2019, for some fixed time \\(t\\)). Although Goodman\nhimself does not speak in these terms, one apparent contrast relates\nto rationality: if one gathered many emeralds before \\(t\\)\nand observed all to be green (and therefore also grue), it would be\nrational to become confident that all emeralds are green, whereas it\nwould not be rational in the same circumstances to become confident\nthat all emeralds are\n grue.[56]\n Philosophers who talk about naturalness have generally seen some\nconnection between this contrast and the fact that greenness is more\nnatural than grueness. However, there has been little consensus about\nhow this connection should be worked out.\n\nFollowing Goodman, the contrast is often summarised by saying that\n\u2018green\u2019 or greenness is \u201cprojectible\u201d, and\n\u2018grue\u2019 or grueness is not. Projectibility is also thought\nof as coming in degrees, the idea perhaps being that a generalization\nabout a more projectible property requires less evidence to make a\ngiven level of confidence rational than the corresponding\ngeneralization about a less projectible property. The difficulty of\nmaking this adequately precise, let alone of working backwards from an\nassignment of degrees of projectibility to a description of the\nrational response(s) to some given evidence, should not be\nunderestimated (see Earman\n 1985\n for some distinctions). But insofar as we are willing to theorise in\nterms of both projectibility and naturalness, we can consider the\nsimple proposal that a property\u2019s degree of projectibility is\nequal to its degree of naturalness. One worry about this (see\nWeatherson\n 2013)\n is that one might want to say for other reasons that being\ngreen is much less natural than, say, being electrically\ncharged, whereas there is no obvious sense in which it would take\nless evidence to be rationally convinced that all emeralds are\nelectrically charged than that all emeralds are green.\n\nAnother approach links Goodman\u2019s contrast to the venerable idea\nthat simpler hypotheses are preferable to more complex hypotheses.\nInduction can be understood (Harman\n 1973;\n White\n 2005),\n as a special case of \u201cinference to the best explanation\u201d,\nwhere being \u201cbest\u201d is partly a matter of simplicity: the\nsuggestion is that the hypothesis (i.e. the proposition) that all\nemeralds are green is simpler than the hypothesis that all emeralds\nare grue. The degree of simplicity of a proposition might simply be\nidentified with its degree of naturalness (see\n \u00a73.3\n above).[57]\n\nOn a third approach, inductive inferences are reconstructed as\nepisodes of Bayesian conditionalisation (see the entry on\n Bayesian epistemology),\n so that the grue-green contrast is traced back to the fact that some\nprior credence functions are more rational than others. In\nthis setting, the most straightforward way to bring in naturalness\nwould be to simplify identify the ideally rational prior credence\nfunctions with the maximally natural functions (within the class of\nfunctions meeting certain formal constraints, such as the axioms of\nprobability\n theory).[58]\n One might also take naturalness to be merely one of several factors\ncontributing to rationality. Or one could appeal to it in some other\nway: for example, Dorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n suggest that reasonable prior credence functions might be weighted\naverages of all sufficiently natural probability functions, in which\nmore natural probability functions receive higher weights.\n\nOne difficulty for all these ways of invoking naturalness in the\ntheory of rationality is that, given the popular doctrine of\nexternalism about the content of belief, according to which duplicate\nthinkers in different environments can believe different propositions\n(see the entry on\n externalism about mental content),\n they lead to the much less popular doctrine of externalism about\nrationality, according to which duplicate thinkers can differ as\nregards the rationality of the inductive inferences they are engaging\nin. (For some arguments against externalism about rationality, see\nWedgwood\n 2002).\n For example, the discovery (by nineteenth-century mineralologist\nAlexis Damour) that the term \u2018jade\u2019 applies to two\ndifferent minerals, jadeite and nephrite, suggests that being\njade is a less natural property than, say, being\nturquoise. The idea that naturalness is connected to the\nrationality of induction threatens to imply that even before\nDamour\u2019s discovery, rationality required less confidence in\nuniversal generalizations about jade (e.g. that all jade can be\npolished with bamboo) than it would have required for duplicate\nbelievers in worlds where all the nephrite in the actual world had\nbeen replaced by jadeite, so that the word \u2018jade\u2019\nexpressed the property being jadeite. Indeed, even those who\nembrace externalism about rationality on other grounds might not be\nhappy with this particular instance of it: there seems to be something\nirrational about someone who, without the benefit of any special\nobservations like those of Damour, is simply disposed to be more\ncautious in endorsing generalizations about jade than in endorsing\ncorresponding generalizations about turquoise.\n\nTo avoid this result without giving up on externalism about mental\ncontent, one might say that what matters in the theory of rationality\nthe naturalness of concepts rather than properties,\nand say that concepts jade and turquoise are equally\nnatural despite the fact that the properties they correspond to are\nnot. But for this to be illuminating, one will need to provide some\npicture of what concepts are, and how naturalness for them relates to\nnaturalness for properties (see\n \u00a73.3).\n\nWeatherson\n (2013;\n see\n Other Internet Resources)\n has a related objection to the claim that naturalness, understood as\nplaying certain other roles we have already discussed (e.g.\u00a0in\nthe analysis of duplication) also makes for projectibility: he argues\nthat being green is highly projectible whereas being an\nelectron is not highly projectible, since merely finding that all\nobserved electrons have a certain mass does not strongly support the\nconclusion that all electrons have that mass, unless one acquires\nfurther evidence which supports the hypothesis that being an electron\nis very natural. Opponents of externalism about mental content, such\nas Lewis\n (1981),\n might respond that their theory of induction is in the first instance\nabout rationality in the formation of narrow beliefs and\ncredences, and propositions like all electrons have mass\n\\(m\\) are not narrowly believed (see the entry on\n narrow mental content).\n But externalists about content will also need to be cautious about\nembracing Weatherson\u2019s argument, since if they want to speak of\n\u201cdegrees of projectibility\u201d at all, there is pressure for\nthem to say that a single property can be denoted by different\nconcepts with different degrees of projectibility.\n4.9 Epistemic value\n\nKnowledge tends to have good effects, at least when combined with\nbenevolence. Similarly, true belief tends to have good effects, while\nfalse belief tends to have bad effects. But some also hold that\nknowledge or belief or high confidence in true propositions is\nnon-instrumentally good (good for its own sake), and perhaps\nalso that belief or high confidence in false propositions is\nnon-instrumentally bad (see the entry on\n the value of knowledge).\n These evaluative claims sometimes go hand in hand with slogans like\n\u2018belief aims at the truth\u2019 and \u2018belief aims at\nknowledge\u2019, the thought being that the goodness of things that\nhave an aim or function consists in their achieving those aims or\nfulfilling those functions. \n\nOnce this starting point is granted, the question arises whether all\ntruths are equally non-instrumentally good to believe, and all\nfalsehoods equally bad. There is reason to think not: it would be a\nwarped kind of concern for the truth that led someone to memorise\nphone books rather than doing science, on the grounds that this is\nmore efficiently generates epistemic value. The concept of naturalness\nseems potentially useful in explaining which truths are most valuable\nto believe. Indeed, if we are willing to apply \u2018natural\u2019\nto propositions as well as properties, the following simple\ngeneralization looks tenable: the more natural a proposition is, the\nbetter it is to know it or believe it or have high confidence in it if\nit is true, and (one might add) the worse it is to believe it or have\nhigh confidence in it if it is false.\n\nSider\n (2011)\n gives pride of place to evaluative considerations in his discussion\nof naturalness: according to him, the fact that \u201cit\u2019s\nbetter to think and speak in joint-carving terms\u201d\nunifies many of the other roles for naturalness. He characterises\nnaturalness as a second \u201caim of belief\u201d, on a par with\ntruth. He furthermore holds that merely using words or concepts that\nstand for unnatural properties is (non-instruementally) bad, even when\nthere is no difference in the propositions believed. His thought is\nthat simply using such words or concepts, no matter what beliefs one\nforms, involves \u2018carving the world up\n incorrectly\u2019.[59]\n Dorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n argue against Sider\u2019s picture of naturalness as a value\nindependent of truth, on the grounds that believing a false natural\nproposition is worse than believing a false unnatural one,\nwhereas on Sider\u2019s account it should be better. For example, a\npill that induces many false beliefs about phone numbers should be\npreferred to one that will induce a single false belief about whether\nneutrinos have mass. They also claim that the value or disvalue in\nusing certain words or concepts is merely instrumental, flowing\nentirely from their tendencies to promote or hinder belief.\n\nThe idea that naturalness matters to epistemic value strikes some as\nmysterious. Dasgupta\n (2018)\n doubts that there is any more non-instrumental value in learning about the distribution\nof natural properties than in learning about the distribution of \nunnatural ones, on\nthe grounds that there would need to be some deeper explanation for\nsuch value-theoretic facts, and no adequate explanation is available.\nHis strategy is to consider some other feature of properties he calls\n\u201cgraturalness\u201d, which grueness is stipulated to have to a\nhigher degree than greenness. When the opponent attempts to explain\nthe evaluative importance of naturalness by appealing to some feature\nwhich naturalness necessarily has and graturalness necessarily lacks\n(e.g.\u00a0making for similarity), Dasgupta will respond by\nintroducing a corresponding \u201cgrueified\u201d feature which\ngraturalness necessarily has and naturalness necessarily lacks\n(e.g.\u00a0making for \u201cgrimilarity\u201d), and complain that\nthe explanatory challenge has merely been pushed back rather than met,\nsince we now need an explanation for the claim that the feature the\nopponent pointed to has an evaluative significance that its grueified\ncounterpart lacks. This strategy is extremely general: indeed, it is\nunclear whether any claim of non-instrumental value could be\nexplained in a way that would satisfy Dasgupta\u2019s criteria for\nadequate explanation.\n\nThose who take naturalness to correlate with epistemic value might\nconsider trying to define naturalness in value-theoretic\nterms. McDaniel\n (2017b)\n attempts something like this, although he appeals to the concept of\nobligation rather than value. He proposes that\nfor a property to be \u201cfundamental\u201d (i.e.\u00a0natural) is for there to be a prima facie\nobligation to form true beliefs about it. One challenge facing views\nalong these lines is that belief is an attitude to propositions,\nwhereas naturalness applies also to properties and relations. McDaniel\naddresses this challenge using a theory of propositions as structured\nentities: for being F to be more natural (to a certain\ndegree) than being G is for it to be the case that whenever\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are two true propositions differing only in that\nbeing F appears in a position in the structure of \\(p\\) where\nbeing G appears in the structure of \\(q\\), there is a\nstronger (by a certain degree) prima facie obligation to believe \\(p\\)\nthan to believe \\(q\\). Note that if this scheme worked, it could also\nused to recover naturalness comparisons for properties and relations\nfrom naturalness comparisons for propositions, independent of the\nconnection to obligation. But it is certainly not uncontroversial than\nthis can be done, even setting aside concerns about the consistency of\nthe required fine-grained theory of propositions. One might think that\nthe naturalness of a proposition turns on factors like the\ndiversity of its \u201cconstituents\u201d as well as the\nsum of their individual degrees of naturalness, so that substituting a\nless natural constituent for a more natural one might sometimes\nincrease the naturalness of a proposition by decreasing its diversity.\nFor example, the proposition that every grue gemstone is surrounded by\ngrue rock is not obviously less natural, or less valuable to believe if true, than the proposition\nthat every grue gemstone is surrounded by green rock.\n4.10 Definability\n\nThere are various logical operations which map some properties to\nothers. One property can be the negation of another, or the\nconjunction or disjunction of two or more others. A monadic property\ncan be the reflexivization of a binary relation; its existential or\nuniversal quantification in one or other of its argument places, or\nthe result of saturating one or other of its argument places with an\nobject: given the relation of loving, reflexivization yields\nloving oneself; quantification yields loving\nsomething, loving everything, being loved by\nsomething, and being loved by everything; while\nsaturation yields, for example, loving Socrates and being\nloved by Socrates. In each of these cases, let us say that the\noutput property is \u201cdefinable from\u201d the input properties\nand objects (taken collectively), and \u201cpartly definable\nfrom\u201d each of the input properties (individually). Let us also\nassume that partial definability is transitive.\n\nThese examples do not amount to definitions of \u2018definable\u2019\nand \u2018partly definable\u2019. Nevertheless, the notions seem\nclear enough for our present purpose, which is to consider how\ndefinability might relate to naturalness. Here are several\ngeneralizations one might find tempting:\n\nIf \\(p\\) is partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is less natural\nthan \\(q\\).\nIf \\(p\\) is partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is not perfectly\nnatural.\nIf \\(p\\) is not partly definable from any \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is\nperfectly natural.\n\n\nA worry about these proposals is that on some accounts, every property\nwill count as partly definable from itself. Then (1) will be\ninconsistent, (2) will entail that no property is perfectly natural,\nand (3) will be vacuously true. The claim that partial definability is\nreflexive might, for example, be motivated by the claim that every\nproperty is the negation of its negation. It might also be motivated,\nat least as far as relations are concerned, by the especially\nplausible claim that every binary relation is the converse of its\nconverse, together with the claim that the the converse of any\nrelation is partially definable from\n it.[60]\n\n\nThese worries do not apply to the corresponding generalizations about\nstrict partial definability, where \\(p\\) is strictly\npartially definable from \\(q\\) just in case \\(p\\) is partially\ndefinable from \\(q\\) and \\(q\\) is not partially definable from \\(p\\):\n\n\nIf \\(p\\) is strictly partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is less\nnatural than \\(q\\).\nIf \\(p\\) is strictly partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is not\nperfectly natural.\nIf \\(p\\) is not strictly partly definable from any \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is\nperfectly natural.\n\n\nAnd here are two other weakenings of (1) and (2) which are also not\ntrivialised even if partial definability is reflexive:\n\nIf \\(p\\) is partly definable from \\(q\\), \\(p\\) is not more natural\nthan \\(q\\).\nIf \\(p\\) is partly definable from \\(q\\) and \\(p\\) is perfectly\nnatural, \\(q\\) is perfectly\n natural.[61]\n\n\nGeneralizations like 1\u20138 are interesting only against the\nbackground of a sufficiently fine-grained theory of properties. All\nare trivialised by intensionalism, the thesis that necessarily\ncoextensive properties are always identical. Consider the following\nconsequence of intensionalism:\n\n\n(D) being \\(F\\) is identical to\nbeing either \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) or \\(F\\) and not\n \\(G\\).[62]\n\n\n\nSince the conjunction and conjunction and disjunction of any two\nproperties count as partially definable out of each of those\nproperties and partial definability is transitive,\n (D)\n implies that every \\(n\\)-ary property is partially definable from\nevery other: being \\(F\\) is partly definable from being\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\), which is in turn partly definable from being\n\\(G\\). This makes (1) inconsistent; makes (2) imply that no\nproperty is perfectly natural; makes (3) and (6) imply that every\nproperty is perfectly natural; makes (4) and (5) vacuously true; makes\n(7) imply that all properties are equally natural; and makes (8) imply\nthat every property is perfectly natural if any are.\n\nIntensionalism is controversial, so the fact that it conflicts with\nour generalizations linking naturalness to definability is not by\nitself a big problem for the generalizations. But once intensionalism\nis denied, there is an urgent need for a systematic theory of\nproperties to replace it. For example: given that\n (D)\n is false for some \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), it would be good to know whether\nit is false for all of them. If so, are there more general principles\nwhich explain this? If not, what marks the difference between the\n\\(F\\), \\(G\\) pairs for which\n (D)\n is true and those for which it is false? Without a background theory\nto provide some guidance with these questions, generalizations linking\npartial definability to naturalness will be of little use: we can\nstill know in many cases that \\(p\\) is partially definable from \\(q\\),\nby knowing of some particular operations that can be applied to \\(q\\)\nto get \\(p\\), but it will be unclear how to argue for any claim of\nstrict partial definability. The task of coming up with a\nconsistent non-intensionalist theory strong enough to answer answer\nsuch questions is by no means straightforward. The most popular\nfine-grained picture holds that properties (and propositions) are\n\u201cstructured\u201d, where this is taken to imply that, for\nexample, bearing \\(R\\) to \\(a\\) is identical to bearing\n\\(S\\) to \\(b\\) only if \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are identical, and \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\) are identical. Unfortunately, when principles of this sort\nare spelled out in the higher-order logic mentioned in \u00a73.4\nabove, and generalized in the obvious way, they lead to an\ninconsistency: the \u201cRussell-Myhill paradox\u201d, first\nidentified in Russell\n 1903\n (appendix B), and subsequently rediscovered by Myhill\n (1958):\n see Goodman\n 2017\n and Dorr\n 2018\n (\u00a76). But this certainly is not the end of the story, even\nwithin the higher order framework. For example, Dorr\n (2016)\n develops a consistent non-intensionalist theory that entails that\n (D)\n is false for every \\(F\\) and\n \\(G\\).[63]\n\n\nOf course, even if one has a fine-grained view that makes partial\ndefinability discriminating enough to be interesting, one may have\nother reasons for rejecting generalizations like (1\u20138). Lewis\n (1970a;\n 1986b, 56\u20139), Creswell\n (1985),\n and Soames\n (2002,\n ch. 11) propose theories on which there are both\n\u201cunstructured\u201d and \u201cstructured\u201d properties and\npropositions, with the former conforming to intensionalism, and the\nlatter being in some sense \u201cconstructed\u201d\n(e.g.\u00a0set-theoretically) out of the former. The notion of\n\u201cconstruction\u201d, or its transitive closure, can provide an\nnon-trivial interpretation of partial definability in these theories.\nBut a hallmark of this kind of theory is that every structured\nproperty is necessarily coextensive with an unstructured one. Given\nthis, generalisation 6 would imply that every property is necessarily\ncoextensive with a perfectly natural property, a claim that is in\nobvious tension with the proposals we have considered linking\nnaturalness to similarity, duplication, qualitativeness, modality,\nlawhood, and mental and linguistic content.\n\nThe concept of full definability also has some notable\npossible applications in the theory of naturalness. We could appeal to\nit to provide an alternative articulation of the intuitive thought\nabout the \u201ccompleteness\u201d of the perfectly natural\nproperties, which Lewis captured using\n TSB:\n\nDefinability\n\nEvery property is fully definable out of some perfectly natural\nproperties and some\n objects.[64]\n\n\nSetting aside doubts about the intelligibility of\n Definability,\n it would seem to be at least as strong as\n TSB.[65]\n At least in the paradigm cases where a proposition is fully definable\nout of some properties and objects, the complete truth about which\nobjects there are and which ones instantiate each of those properties\nwill either necessitate that proposition or necessitate its negation.\nBy contrast, the inference from\n TSB\n to\n Definability\n is quite controversial. There are arguments which purport to show\nthat whenever a property supervenes on some properties, it is\ndefinable in terms of them (Jackson\n 1998;\n Stalnaker\n 1996);\n but these arguments rely on an intensionalist theory of properties,\nand raise difficult issues even in that setting (Leuenberger\n 2018).\n \n\nAssuming that\n TSB\n is weaker than\n Definability,\n it is arguably too weak to capture the intuitive idea that a\ndescription of the world in terms of perfectly natural properties\nshould be a \u201ccomplete\u201d description. Indeed, the claim that\nproperties that not perfectly natural are definable in terms of\nperfectly natural properties seems to be required for the\nsimplicity-of-definition criterion to yield sensible results.\nMoreover, many of those who see a gulf between definability and mere\nsupervenience have also felt that there is something metaphysically\nsuspect about infinite descending chains of definability. If we can\nfind a way to spell out a ban on such chains, it will plausibly imply\nthat every property is fully definable out of indefinable\nproperties (and objects); and this claim will in turn\n Definability\n if we take indefinability to imply perfect naturalness, as in (3) or\n(6) above. \n\nOn the other hand,\n Definability\n also faces objections that\n TSB\n avoids. For example, many philosophers follow Moore\n (1903)\n in denying that moral properties are definable from physical\nproperties while still affirming that they supervene on physical\nproperties; some such philosophers might be reluctant to say that any\nmoral properties are perfectly natural, perhaps because they are\nattracted to modal independence principles. \n4.11 Grounding\n\nMost of the present section has focused on generalisations linking naturalness with relatively familiar, easy-to-grasp notions.  We have not yet discussed possible links between naturalness and many other \u201cheavy duty\u201d metaphysical notions \u2014 notions whose good standing and theoretical utility is as controversial as that of naturalness itself.  Among the notions for which such connections might be worth investigating are: essence (Fine 1994); ontological dependence (see the entry on ontological dependence); truthmaking (see the entry on truthmakers); substance (see the entry on substance); reality and factuality (Fine 2001); modes of being (explained in terms of naturalness in McDaniel 2017b, ch.\u00a01); and degrees of being (McDaniel 2017b, ch.\u00a07).  Space precludes a discussion of these topics.  But to convey a sense of the possibilities, let us briefly consider some possible connections to grounding, a notion that has been especially prominent in the recent metaphysics literature (for background, see the\nentry on metaphysical grounding).\n\n\nEspecially given the widespread use of \u2018fundamental\u2019 as\nequivalent to \u2018ungrounded\u2019, it seems plausible that there\nmight be some intimate link between naturalness and\ngrounding. So far, however, most discussions of naturalness and\ngrounding tend to treat the notions as being in some sense rivals\n(see, e.g., Sider\n 2011,\n ch. 8), so there have been few attempts at systematic theorising\nusing both together. Here are some generalizations that seem worth\nconsidering:\n\nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is partly grounded by the\nfact that \\(G(y_1,\\ldots,y_m)\\), then \\(F\\) is less natural than\n\\(G\\). \nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is partly grounded by the\nfact that \\(G(y_1,\\ldots,y_m)\\), then \\(F\\) is not more natural than\n\\(G\\). \nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is partly grounded by some\nfact, then \\(F\\) is not perfectly natural. \nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is partly grounded by the\nfact that \\(G(y_1,\\ldots,y_m)\\), and \\(F\\) is perfectly natural, then\n\\(G\\) is perfectly natural.\nIf the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is not partly grounded by\nany fact, then \\(F\\) is perfectly natural. \n\n\nNote that (1) implies (2) and (3), which each imply (4); (5) is independent of (1\u20134). The notion of\npartial ground might in turn be defined in terms of full\nground, which relates a plurality of facts (e.g. the fact that snow is\nwhite and the fact that grass is green) to a single fact (e.g. the\nfact that snow is white and grass is green): one fact partially\ngrounds another just in case it belongs to some plurality of facts\nthat fully grounds\n it.[66]\n\n\nThese suggestions are all quite tendentious. (1) is especially\nproblematic since it rules out cases where the fact that\n\\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is grounded by the fact that\n\\(F(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\): for example, one might want to say that the\nfact that Central Park is in New York City is partially grounded by\nthe fact that Central Park is in Manhattan. While (2) avoids this\nproblem, it is still hard to square with a thesis endorsed by most grounding\ntheorists: that an existential generalization is partially grounded by\neach of its instances (Fine\n 2012,\n 59; Rosen\n 2010,\n 117). Consider a blob of clay \\(x\\) with a certain very specific\nshape-property \\(S\\). The thesis about existential generalizations\nentails that the fact that \\(x\\) has some shape or other is\npartially grounded by the fact that \\(x\\) has \\(S\\). But the idea that\n\\(S\\) is more natural than having some shape or other fits\npoorly with many other parts of the naturalness role, such as the\nconnections to similarity, content, laws, and ampliative reasoning. A\nworry about (3) is that it might make it too hard for a property to\ncount as perfectly natural. One might think that whenever the fact\nthat \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is ungrounded, there are also some other\nobjects \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) such that the fact that\n\\(F(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\) is grounded: perhaps, for example, the\nungrounded facts are all predications of mereologically simple objects\nof properties which are also instantiated by certain mereologically\ncomplex objects. Several of the generalizations also run into trouble\nif we assume a moderately coarse-grained conception of facts, on which\n(for example) the fact that Cleopatra loves Cleopatra is identical to\nthe fact that Cleopatra is a self-lover. For example, under this\nassumption, (5) will have the surprising consequence that if the fact\nthat \\(R(x,x)\\) is ungrounded, not only the binary relation \\(R\\), but\nalso the monadic property bearing \\(R\\) to oneself is\nperfectly\n natural.[67]\n (Grounding-theorists often assume a fine-grained account of facts\nwhich would avoid this kind of problem; but there are worries about\nthe consistency of such accounts similar to the worries about\nfine-grained theories of properties discussed in\n \u00a74.10.)\n \n\nMore ambitiously, one might attempt to provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions for perfect naturalness in grounding-theoretic\nterms, by strengthening (5) to (6), or (3) to (7):\n\n\\(F\\) is perfectly natural if and only if it is possible for there\nto be some \\(x_1,\\ldots, x_n\\) such that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) and the\nfact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is ungrounded. \n\\(F\\) is perfectly natural if and only if it is possible for there\nto be some \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) such that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\), and it\nis necessary that for any \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\) such that\n\\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\), the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is\nungrounded. \n\n\n(6) and (7) are compatible, but their conjunction has a controversial\npurely grounding-theoretic consequence, namely that whenever\n\\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) and the fact that \\(F(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\) is\nungrounded, the fact that \\(F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is also ungrounded.\n\n\nOne could also consider trying to define grounding in terms of\nnaturalness. Here is a simple proposal, using the notion of\nnaturalness for propositions (see \u00a73.3),\nand assuming that facts are equated with true propositions:\n\n\\(p\\) is fully grounded by \\(qq\\) if and only if (a)\neach of \\(qq\\) is true; (b) it is necessary that if all of \\(qq\\)\nare true then \\(p\\) is true, and (c) each of \\(qq\\) is more natural \nthan \\(p\\).[68]\n\n\n\nGrounding theorists (who have generally been pessimistic about\nattempts to define grounding in other terms) will likely object that\n(8) wrongly entails that whenever \\(p\\) is fully grounded by \\(qq\\),\nand \\(r\\) is both true and more natural than \\(p\\) obtains, \\(p\\) is also fully grounded by \\(qq\\)\ntogether with \\(r\\) (even if \\(r\\) is intuitively completely\nirrelevant to \\(p\\)). One might try to refine (8) to avoid this\nobjection by adding some further \u201crelevance\u201d condition,\nalso explained in terms of naturalness; but it is not obvious how this\nshould go. \n\nOne further possible application of the ideology of grounding worth\nconsidering is in making precise the idea about the\n\u201ccompleteness\u201d of the description of the world in terms of\nperfectly natural properties which Lewis cashed out as\n TSB.\n An obvious idea is simply to replace the notion of metaphysical\nnecessitation in\n TSB\n with that of grounding: \n\nGrounding Completeness\n\nNecessarily, every fact is either fully grounded by, or a member of,\nsome collection of facts each of which is either (a) the fact that\n\\(R(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) or \\(\\neg R(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n)\\), for some\nperfectly natural \\(R\\) and objects \\(x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\); (b) the fact\nthat \\(\\exists y(y=x)\\), for some object \\(x\\), or (c) the fact that\nevery object is one of \\(xx\\), where \\(xx\\) are all the objects there\nare. \n\nGiven the standard assumption that full grounding entails\nnecessitation, this will be at least as strong as\n TSB,\n while arguably not being as strong as\n Definability\n (see\n \u00a74.10).\n5. Doubts about naturalness\n\nThe question whether to admit distinctions of naturalness among\nproperties is often treated as a major choice point for theorising in\nmetaphysics. Lewis presents his various proposals involving\nnaturalness as part of an overarching argument for the good standing\nof the notion of naturalness, based on its theoretical utility.\nMeanwhile, the rejection of distinctions of naturalness is often (e.g.\nby Taylor\n 1993)\n thought of as bound up with the denial of \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nor \u201cfull-blooded\u201d realism, and associated with\ncontroversial claims about mind-dependence or\nperspective-relativity.\n\nBut it is not obvious what is at issue in such disagreements. If\n\u201crejecting\u201d naturalness means holding that\n\u2018natural\u2019 is literally unintelligible (on the\nrelevant use), it seems misguided. So long as we take understanding a\nword to be a matter of induction into a practice rather than some\ndubious \u201cmagical grasp\u201d (Sider\n 2011,\n \u00a72.1), it is hard to imagine some plausibly attainable standard\nfor intelligibility that the practice of using \u2018natural\u2019\nin the relevant way fails to meet. A more promising idea is simply to\nequate \u201crejection\u201d of naturalness with the claim that no\nproperty is more natural than any other. (Similarly, atheists will do\nbetter claiming that nothing is more holy than anything else than\nclaiming that the word \u2018holy\u2019 is unintelligible.)\nUnfortunately, if we try to structure a debate around the question\n\u2018Are some properties more natural than others?\u2019, we will\nrun a serious risk of equivocation. One participant may treat it as\ndefinitional that if there are any distinctions of naturalness,\nnaturalness plays a certain wide array of the roles that Lewis and\nothers have claimed for it in the theories of similarity, lawhood,\nreference, epistemic value, etc.; such a philosopher will treat any\nargument that no single ranking of properties plays all of these roles\nas an argument that no property is more natural than any other.\nAnother participant might give pride of place to (say) the connection\nbetween naturalness and similarity, treating as obvious that some\nproperties are more natural than others (since some things are more\nsimilar to one another than others), while treating it as an open\nquestion whether naturalness has any interesting connection to\nlawhood, reference, etc. Such philosophers need not disagree over\nanything important.\n\nDorr and Hawthorne\n (2013)\n argue that \u2018Are some properties more natural than\nothers?\u2019 is too sensitive to unimportant disagreements about how\nphilosophical terms of art get their meanings to be a useful\n question.[69]\n Inspired by Lewis\u2019s work on theoretical terms (Lewis\n 1970b),\n they suggest that the central debates in this vicinity should focus,\ninstead, on the question which collections of the roles that\nnaturalness has been held to play in the literature are such that\nthere is some ranking of properties that plays all the roles\nin the collection. \u201cNaturalness enthusiasts\u201d will hold\nthat there is a single ranking of properties playing all or most of\nthe roles; \u201cnaturalness sceptics\u201d, meanwhile, will hold\nthat different roles impose incompatible constraints, so that no\nranking satisfies more than a few of them. (For example, one might\nthink that there is no family of properties on which all others\nsupervene and which are also such that properties with short, simple\ndefinitions terms of this family tend to be easier to refer to than\nproperties with only long, complex definitions.) Dorr and Hawthorne\ngive a long list of collections of roles whose co-satisfiability is\nnon-obvious. They also discuss one separate axis of disagreement: some\nwill think that \u2018natural\u2019, or at least \u2018perfectly\nnatural\u2019, is precise, or can readily be made so, while\nothers will regard it as vague, perhaps to a high\n degree.[70]\n\n\nOn this picture, the impression of a single choice point between\n\u201cadmitting\u201d and \u201crejecting\u201d naturalness is\nmisleading: the true theoretical landscape is quite intricate.\nMoreover, even the most \u201csceptical\u201d positions do not seem\nto have much of an anti-realist flavour. There is no obvious\nway to argue from the claim that there are extensive failures of\nco-satisfiability between the various alleged roles for naturalness,\nor from the claim that \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018perfectly\nnatural\u2019 are highly vague, to some controversial claim of\nmind-dependence or relativity. Theories about naturalness provide ways\nof sharpening and fleshing out what Lewis\n (1984, 228)\n calls \u201cthe traditional realism that recognises objective\nsameness and difference, joints in the world, discriminatory\nclassifications not of our own making\u201d. But the ideas discussed\nin this article do not seem particularly helpful for making any\nnontrivial sense of the competing vision, on which questions of\nsimilarity and classification are in some systematic way\n\u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cup to us\u201d.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["<li id=\"ref-ArmstrongTU\">Armstrong, David M., 1978. <em>A Theory of\nUniversals</em> (Volume 2: <em>Universals and Scientific\nRealism</em>), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "<li id=\"ref-ArmstrongCTP\">\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1989. <em>A\nCombinatorial Theory of Possibility</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press.", "<li id=\"ref-BaconBN\">Bacon, Andrew, 2018. \u201cThe Broadest\nNecessity,\u201d <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em>, 47:\n733\u201383.", "<li id=\"ref-BealerQC\">Bealer, George, 1982. <em>Quality and\nConcept</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "<li id=\"ref-BennettMTU\">Bennett, Karen, 2017. <em>Making Things\nUp</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "<li id=\"ref-BigelowRN\">Bigelow, John, 1988. <em>The Reality of\nNumbers: A Physicalist\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press.", "<li id=\"ref-BoolosVariables\">Boolos, George, 1984. \u201cTo Be Is To\nBe the Value of a Variable (Or To Be Some Values of Some\nVariables),\u201d <em>Journal of Philosophy</em>, 81:\n430\u201349.", "<li id=\"ref-BoydRAENK\">Boyd, Richard, 1991. \u201cRealism,\nAnti-Foundationalism and the Enthusiasm for Natural Kinds,\u201d\n<em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 61: 127\u201348.", "<li id=\"ref-BrickerIU\">Bricker, Phillip, 1996. \u201cIsolation and\nUnification: The Realist Analysis of Possible Worlds,\u201d\n<em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 84: 225\u201338.", "<li id=\"ref-BrickerRGP\">\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006. \u201cThe\nRelation between General and Particular: Entailment vs.\nSupervenience,\u201d in Dean W.
