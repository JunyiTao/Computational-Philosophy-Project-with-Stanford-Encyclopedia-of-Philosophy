    "main_text": "Definitions of \u201cAgnosticism\u201d\n2. Definitions of \u201cAgnosticism\u201d\n\nThe terms \u201cagnostic\u201d and \u201cagnosticism\u201d were\nfamously coined in the late nineteenth century by the English\nbiologist, T.H. Huxley. He said that he originally\n\n\ninvented the word \u201cAgnostic\u201d to denote people who, like\n[himself], confess themselves to be hopelessly ignorant concerning a\nvariety of matters [including of course the matter of God\u2019s\nexistence], about which metaphysicians and theologians, both orthodox\nand heterodox, dogmatise with the utmost confidence. (1884)\n\n\nHe did not, however, define \u201cagnosticism\u201d simply as the\nstate of being an agnostic. Instead, he often used that term to refer\nto a normative epistemological principle, something similar to (though\nweaker than) what we now call \u201cevidentialism\u201d. Roughly,\nHuxley\u2019s principle says that it is wrong to say that one knows\nor believes that a proposition is true without logically satisfactory\nevidence (Huxley 1884 and 1889). But it was Huxley\u2019s application\nof this principle to theistic and atheistic belief that ultimately had\nthe greatest influence on the meaning of the term. He argued that,\nsince neither of those beliefs is adequately supported by evidence, we\nought to suspend judgment on the issue of whether or not there is a\nGod.\n\nNowadays, the term \u201cagnostic\u201d is often used (when the\nissue is God\u2019s existence) to refer to those who follow the\nrecommendation expressed in the conclusion of Huxley\u2019s argument:\nan agnostic is a person who has entertained the proposition that there\nis a God but believes neither that it is true nor that it is false.\nNot surprisingly, then, the term \u201cagnosticism\u201d is\noften defined, both in and outside of philosophy, not as a principle\nor any other sort of proposition but instead as the psychological\nstate of being an agnostic. Call this the \u201cpsychological\u201d\nsense of the term. It is certainly useful to have a term to refer to\npeople who are neither theists nor atheists, but philosophers might\nwish that some other term besides \u201cagnostic\u201d\n(\u201ctheological skeptic\u201d, perhaps?) were used. The problem\nis that it is also very useful for philosophical purposes to have a\nname for the epistemological position that follows from the premise of\nHuxley\u2019s argument, the position that neither theism nor atheism\nis known, or most ambitiously, that neither the belief that God exists\nnor the belief that God does not exist has positive epistemic status\nof any sort. Just as the metaphysical question of God\u2019s\nexistence is central to philosophy of religion, so too is the\nepistemological question of whether or not theism or atheism is known\nor has some other sort of positive epistemic status like being\njustified, rational, reasonable, or probable. And given the etymology\nof \u201cagnostic\u201d, what better term could there be for a\nnegative answer to that epistemological question than\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d? Further, as suggested earlier, it is, for\nvery good reason, typical in philosophy to use the suffix\n\u201c-ism\u201d to refer to a proposition instead of to a state or\ncondition, since only the former can sensibly be tested by\nargument.\n\nIf, however, \u201cagnosticism\u201d is defined as a proposition,\nthen \u201cagnostic\u201d must be defined in terms of\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d instead of the other way around.\nSpecifically, \u201cagnostic\u201d must be defined as a person who\nbelieves that the proposition \u201cagnosticism\u201d is true\ninstead of \u201cagnosticism\u201d being defined as the state of\nbeing an agnostic. And if the proposition in question is that neither\ntheism nor atheism is known to be true, then the term\n\u201cagnostic\u201d can no longer serve as a label for those who\nare neither theists nor atheists since one can consistently believe\nthat atheism (or theism) is true while denying that atheism (or\ntheism) is known to be true.\n\nWhen used in this epistemological sense, the term\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d can very naturally be extended beyond the\nissue of what is or can be known to cover a large family of positions,\ndepending on what sort of \u201cpositive epistemic status\u201d is\nat issue. For example, it might be identified with any of the\nfollowing positions: that neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief\nis justified, that neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief is\nrationally required, that neither belief is rationally permissible,\nthat neither has warrant, that neither is reasonable, or that neither\nis probable. Also, in order to avoid the vexed issue of the nature of\nknowledge, one can simply distinguish as distinct members of the\n\u201cagnosticism family\u201d each of the following claims about\nintellectually sophisticated people: (i) neither theism nor atheism is\nadequately supported by the internal states of such people, (ii)\nneither theistic belief nor atheistic belief coheres with the rest of\ntheir beliefs, (iii) neither theistic nor atheistic belief results\nfrom reliable belief-producing processes, (iv) neither theistic belief\nnor atheistic belief results from faculties aimed at truth that are\nfunctioning properly in an appropriate environment, and so on.\n\nNotice too that, even if agnosticism were defined as the rather\nextreme position that neither theistic belief nor atheistic belief\never has positive epistemic status of any sort, it\nwouldn\u2019t follow by definition that no agnostic is\neither a theist or an atheist. Some fideists, for example, believe\nthat neither atheistic belief nor theistic belief is supported or\nsanctioned in any way at all by reason because reason leaves the\nmatter of God\u2019s existence completely unresolved. Yet they have\nfaith that God exists and such faith (at least in some cases) involves\nbelief. Thus, some fideists are extreme agnostics in the\nepistemological sense even though they are not agnostics in the\npsychological sense.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that, even in Huxley\u2019s time, some\napophatic theists embraced the term \u201cagnostic\u201d, claiming\nthat all good Christians worshipped an \u201cunknown God\u201d. More\nrecently, some atheists proudly call themselves \u201cagnostic\natheists\u201d, although with further reflection the symmetry between\nthis position and fideism might give them pause. More likely, though,\nwhat is being claimed by these self-identified agnostic atheists is\nthat, while their belief that God does not exist has positive\nepistemic status of some sort (minimally, it is not irrational), it\ndoes not have the sort of positive epistemic status that can turn true\nbelief into knowledge.\n\nNo doubt both senses of \u201cagnosticism\u201d, the psychological\nand the epistemological, will continue to be used both inside and\noutside of philosophy. Hopefully, context will help to disambiguate.\nIn the remainder of this entry, however, the term\n\u201cagnosticism\u201d will be used in its epistemological sense.\nThis makes a huge difference to the issue of justification. Consider,\nfor example, this passage written by the agnostic, Anthony Kenny\n(1983: 84\u201385):\n\n\nI do not myself know of any argument for the existence of God which I\nfind convincing; in all of them I think I can find flaws. Equally, I\ndo not know of any argument against the existence of God which is\ntotally convincing; in the arguments I know against the existence of\nGod I can equally find flaws. So that my own position on the existence\nof God is agnostic.\n\n\nIt is one thing to ask whether Kenny\u2019s inability to find\narguments that convince him of God\u2019s existence or non-existence\njustifies him personally in suspending judgment about the existence of\nGod. It is quite another to ask whether this inability (or anything\nelse) would justify his believing that no one (or at least no one who\nis sufficiently intelligent and well-informed) has a justified belief\nabout God\u2019s existence.\n\nIf agnosticism (in one sense of the word) is the position that neither\ntheism nor atheism is known, then it might be useful to use the term\n\u201cgnosticism\u201d to refer to the contradictory of that\nposition, that is, to the position that either theism or atheism is\nknown. That view would, of course, come in two flavors: theistic\ngnosticism\u2014the view that theism is known (and hence atheism is\nnot)\u2014and atheistic gnosticism\u2014the view that atheism is\nknown (and hence theism is not).\n",
