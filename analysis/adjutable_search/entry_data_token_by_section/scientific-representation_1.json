    "main_text": "General Griceanism and Stipulative Fiat\n2. General Griceanism and Stipulative Fiat\n\nCallender and Cohen (2006) give a radical answer to the demarcation\nproblem: there is no difference between scientific representations and\nother kinds of representations, not even between scientific and\nartistic representation. Underlying this claim is a position they call\n\u201cGeneral Griceanism\u201d (GG). The core of GG is the reductive\nclaim that all representations owe their status as representations to\na privileged core of fundamental representations. GG then comes with a\npractical prescription about how to proceed with the analysis of a\nrepresentation:\n\n\nthe General Gricean view consists of two stages. First, it explains\nthe representational powers of derivative representations in terms of\nthose of fundamental representations; second, it offers some other\nstory to explain representation for the fundamental bearers of\ncontent. (2006: 73)\n\n\nOf these stages only the second requires serious philosophical work,\nand this work is done in the philosophy of mind because the\nfundamental form of representation is mental representation.\n\nScientific representation is a derivative kind of representation\n(2006: 71, 75) and hence falls under the first stage of the above\nrecipe. It is reduced to mental representation by an act of\nstipulation. In Callender and Cohen\u2019s own example, the salt\nshaker on the dinner table can represent Madagascar as long as someone\nstipulates that the former represents the latter, since\n\n\nthe representational powers of mental states are so wide-ranging that\nthey can bring about other representational relations between\narbitrary relata by dint of mere stipulation. (2006: 73\u201374)\n\n\nSo explaining any form of representation other than mental\nrepresentation is a triviality\u2014all it takes is an act of\n\u201cstipulative fiat\u201d (2006: 75). This supplies an answer to\nthe ER-problem:\n\nStipulative Fiat: A scientific model \\(M\\) represents a\ntarget system \\(T\\) iff a model user stipulates that \\(M\\) represents\n\\(T\\).\n\nThe first problem facing Stipulative Fiat is whether or not\nstipulation, or the bare intentions of language users, suffice to\nestablish representational relationships. In the philosophy of\nlanguage this gets called the \u201cHumpty Dumpty\u201d problem. It\nconcerns whether or not Lewis Carroll\u2019s Humpty Dumpty could use\nthe word \u201cglory\u201d to mean \u201ca nice knockdown\nargument\u201d (Donnellan 1968; MacKay 1968). (We ignore the\ndifference between meaning and denotation here). In that context it\ndoesn\u2019t seem like he can, and analogous questions can be posed\nin the context of scientific representation: can a scientist make any\nmodel represent any target simply by stipulating that it does?\n\nEven if stipulation were sufficient to establish some sort of\nrepresentational relationship, Stipulative Fiat fails to meet\nthe Surrogative Reasoning Condition: assuming a salt shaker represents\nMadagascar in virtue of someone\u2019s stipulation that this is so,\nthis tells us nothing about how the salt shaker could be used to learn\nabout Madagascar in the way that scientific models are used to learn\nabout their targets (Liu 2015: 46\u201347, for a related objections\nsee Boesch 2017: 974\u2013978, Bueno and French 2011: 871\u2013873,\nGelfert 2016: 33, Ruyant 2021: 535). And appealing to additional facts\nabout the salt shaker (the salt shaker being to the right of the\npepper mill might allow us to infer that Madagascar is to the east of\nMozambique) in order to answer this objection goes beyond\nStipulative Fiat. Callender and Cohen do admit some\nrepresentations are more useful than others, but claim that\n\n\nthe questions about the utility of these representational vehicles are\nquestions about the pragmatics of things that are representational\nvehicles, not questions about their representational status per\nse. (2006: 75)\n\n\nBut even if the Surrogative Reasoning Condition is relegated to the\nrealm of \u201cpragmatics\u201d it seems reasonable to ask for an\naccount of how it is met.\n\nAn important thing to note is that even if Stipulative Fiat\nis untenable, we needn\u2019t give up on GG. GG only requires that\nthere be some explanation of how derivative representations\nrelate to fundamental representations; it does not require that this\nexplanation be of a particular kind, much less that it consist in\nnothing but an act of stipulation (Toon 2010: 77\u201378). Ruyant\n(2021) has recently proposed what he calls \u201ctrue\nGriceanism\u201d, which differs from the original account in that it\ninvolves a non-trivial reduction of scientific representation to more\nfundamental representations (complex sequences mental states and\npurpose-directed behaviour) in a way that is also sensitive to the\ncommunal aspects of practices in which the models are embedded. This\nis a step into the direction indicated by Toon. More generally, as\nCallender and Cohen note, all that it requires is that there is a\nprivileged class of representations and that other types of\nrepresentations owe their representational capacities to their\nrelationship with the primitive ones. So philosophers need an account\nof how members of this privileged class of representations represent,\nand how derivative representations, which includes scientific models,\nrelate to this class. When stated like this, many recent contributors\nto the debate on scientific representation can be seen as falling\nunder the umbrella of GG. Indeed, As we will see below, many of the\nmore developed versions of the accounts of scientific representation\ndiscussed throughout this entry invoke the intentions of model users,\nalbeit in a more complex manner than Stipulative Fiat.\n",
