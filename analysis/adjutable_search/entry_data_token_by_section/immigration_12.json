    "main_text": "Arguments for Open Borders || Utilitarianism\n2.4 Utilitarianism\n\n\nFinally, the utilitarian case for open borders stresses that\nrestricting freedom of movement leads to obvious inefficiencies and is\ntherefore impermissible. There are any number of ways in which it\nis suboptimal to forcibly restrain people within territorial\nboundaries, but one of the most obvious worries is that it is\neconomically inefficient. Restricting Mexicans from fully\ndeveloping and capitalizing upon their talents in the United States\neconomy, for instance, makes no more sense than relegating men and\nwomen into separate spheres. Just as a system in which only men\nmay be doctors and only women may work as nurses unjustifiably deprives\nthe world of countless excellent female doctors and male nurses, a\ngeo-political system in which countries are entitled to exclude\noutsiders regrettably fails to capitalize upon the talents and work\nethic of foreigners who are denied access to the world\u2019s most\nrobust labor markets. Given this, it seems reasonable to believe\nthat people would on average be much better off if there were no\nrestrictions on immigration.\n\n\nThis argument can be contested on either empirical or moral\ngrounds. For instance, without questioning whether restricting\nimmigration is in some ways inefficient, one might still defend the\nmerits of dividing the globe into separate states, each of which has\nsovereign control over its territory. This view seems plausible\nif the advantages to such a state system outweigh the inefficiencies in\nquestion. For instance, David Miller (2005) argues that\nrestrictions on immigration improve our ability effectively to address\npopulation control. As Miller recognizes, we will make progress\nin this regard only if leaders in countries like India and China are\nable and willing to enact the relatively unpopular laws necessary to\nlimit population growth. And these laws would be met with much\nmore resistance than they already are if there were no restrictions on\nmigration, because the costs of population growth would not be wholly\ninternalized. If a country\u2019s exploding population were free\nto move anywhere in the world, for instance, then its citizens would\nnot bear the full costs of population growth and would therefore be\nthat much more resistant to laws designed to limit the number of\nchildren born. If Miller is right, the advantages of restricting\nimmigration may more than compensate for the costs involved.\n\n\nFor the sake of argument, though, let us suppose that the gains of\nopen borders would be greater than the costs. Even so, it is\nnot clear that the utilitarian case for open borders is decisive,\nsince, as a moral matter, it may be that states have the right to\norganize their affairs in a suboptimal fashion. Most believe that\nparents would retain the right to raise their natural children in\nexclusive, nuclear families even if Plato were right that it would be\npreferable if a community\u2019s children were raised together by the\ncommunity as a whole. And if we think, contra utilitarianism,\nthat individuals are entitled to arrange their lives in suboptimal ways\nin the domestic sphere, why presume that political states lack the\nanalogous right to organize themselves as they see fit in the\ngeo-political context? Even if it were true that Norway and the\nEuropean Union would be better off if the former joined this regional\nbody as a full member, for instance, it seems to many that Norway\nshould have the right to refrain from joining this Union. And if\nNorway has the right to (inefficiently) refuse to associate fully with\nthe European Union, it might also be entitled to (inefficiently) refuse\nto associate with various individuals who would like to join\nNorway\u2019s political community.\n",
