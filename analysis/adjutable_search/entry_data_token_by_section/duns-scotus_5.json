    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The subject matter of metaphysics\n3.1 The subject matter of metaphysics\n\nMetaphysics, according to Scotus, is a \u201creal theoretical\nscience\u201d: it is real in that it treats things rather than\nconcepts, theoretical in that it is pursued for its own sake rather\nthan as a guide for doing or making things, and a science in that it\nproceeds from self-evident principles to conclusions that follow\ndeductively from them. The various real theoretical sciences are\ndistinguished by their subject matter, and Scotus devotes considerable\nattention to determining what the distinctive subject matter of\nmetaphysics is. His conclusion is that metaphysics concerns\n\u201cbeing qua being\u201d (ens inquantum ens).\nThat is, the metaphysician studies being simply as such, rather than\nstudying, say, material being as material.\n\nThe study of being qua being includes, first of all, the\nstudy of the transcendentals, so called because they transcend the\ndivision of being into finite and infinite, and the further division\nof finite being into the ten Aristotelian categories. Being itself is\na transcendental, and so are the \u201cproper attributes\u201d of\nbeing\u2014one, true, and good\u2014which are coextensive with\nbeing. Scotus also identifies an indefinite number of disjunctions\nthat are coextensive with being and therefore count as\ntranscendentals, such as infinite-or-finite and\nnecessary-or-contingent. Finally, all the pure perfections (see above)\nare transcendentals, since they transcend the division of being into\nfinite and infinite. Unlike the proper attributes of being and the\ndisjunctive transcendentals, however, they are not coextensive with\nbeing. For God is wise and Socrates is wise, but\nearthworms\u2014though they are certainly beings\u2014are not\nwise.\n\nThe study of the Aristotelian categories also belongs to metaphysics\ninsofar as the categories, or the things falling under them, are\nstudied as beings. (If they are studied as concepts, they belong\ninstead to the logician.) There are exactly ten categories, Scotus\nargues. The first and most important is the category of substance.\nSubstances are beings in the most robust sense, since they have an\nindependent existence: that is, they do not exist in\nsomething else. Beings in any of the other nine categories, called\naccidents, exist in substances. The nine categories of accidents are\nquantity, quality, relation, action, passion, place, time, position,\nand state (habitus).\n",
