    "main_text": "The Beautiful: Aesthetics in the Enlightenment\n3. The Beautiful: Aesthetics in the Enlightenment\n\nModern systematic philosophical aesthetics not only first emerges in\nthe context of the Enlightenment, but also flowers brilliantly there.\nAs Ernst Cassirer notes, the eighteenth century not only thinks of\nitself as the \u201ccentury of philosophy\u201d, but also as\n\u201cthe age of criticism,\u201d where criticism is centrally\n(though not only) art and literary criticism (Cassirer 1932, 255).\nPhilosophical aesthetics flourishes in the period because of its\nstrong affinities with the tendencies of the age. Alexander\nBaumgarten, the German philosopher in the school of Christian Wolff,\nfounds systematic aesthetics in the period, in part through giving it\nits name. \u201cAesthetics\u201d is derived from the Greek word for\n\u201csenses\u201d, because for Baumgarten a science of the\nbeautiful would be a science of the sensible, a science of sensible\ncognition. The Enlightenment in general re-discovers the value of the\nsenses, not only in cognition, but in human lives in general, and so,\ngiven the intimate connection between beauty and human sensibility,\nthe Enlightenment is naturally particularly interested in aesthetics.\nAlso, the Enlightenment includes a general recovery and affirmation of\nthe value of pleasure in human lives, against the tradition of\nChristian asceticism, and the flourishing of the arts, of the\ncriticism of the arts and of the philosophical theorizing about\nbeauty, promotes and is promoted by this recovery and affirmation. The\nEnlightenment also enthusiastically embraces the discovery and\ndisclosure of rational order in nature, as manifest most clearly in\nthe development of the new science. It seems to many theorists in the\nEnlightenment that the faculty of taste, the faculty by which we\ndiscern beauty, reveals to us some part of this order, a distinctive\nharmony, unities amidst variety. Thus, in the phenomenon of aesthetic\npleasure, human sensibility discloses to us rational order, thus\nbinding together two enthusiasms of the Enlightenment.\n",
