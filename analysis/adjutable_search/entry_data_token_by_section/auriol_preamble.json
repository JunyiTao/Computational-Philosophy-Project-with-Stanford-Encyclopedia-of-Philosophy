    "main_text": "\n\nWhile the French Franciscan Peter Auriol (ca. 1280\u20131322) has not\nattracted as much attention as has his slightly younger contemporary\nWilliam Ockham, nevertheless on many topics Auriol was probably just\nas influential among fourteenth century thinkers as was the Venerable\nInceptor. Often explicitly rejecting the ideas of Thomas Aquinas,\nHenry of Ghent, and most importantly John Duns Scotus, Auriol created\ninteresting, innovative, and frequently controversial positions over a\nwhole range of philosophical and theological issues \u2014 not least\nin his theory of cognition \u2014 and many of his positions set the\nterms of debate for later thinkers like Gregory of Rimini and John\nCapreolus.\n",
