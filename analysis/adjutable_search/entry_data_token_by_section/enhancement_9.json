    "main_text": "Are Enhancements Dehumanizing?\n6. Conclusion: Policy Perspectives\nNothing in the current debates over the ethics of human enhancement\nconvincingly supports the conclusion that the impulse that drives interest\nin biomedical enhancement is inauthentically human or morally evil. To\nthe extent that all technology is construed as an effort to extend and\nimprove our inherited human capacities, the impulse to enhance\nourselves is a hallmark of our species, as legitimate to celebrate as\nto disparage. On the other hand, just as specific technologies are\nnever \u201cvalue neutral\u201d in their design or use, specific\napplications of biomedical human enhancement can be dangerous, unfair,\nor vicious. Thus, it is reasonable to endorse the generic claim that\nbiomedical enhancement is morally acceptable as a human practice, and\nstill argue that specific biomedical enhancements would be unethical to\npursue.\nAs with other potent technologies, at some level the potential harms\nof unethical enhancements will also justify social efforts to formally\ncontrol their development and use through regulation, law and public\npolicy. Even though this topic moves quickly beyond the biomedical\ndomain to fundamental tensions in political and social philosophy, it\ndoes preoccupy enough of the practical ethics literature on biomedical\nenhancement to warrant a brief concluding discussion here.\nSome argue that firm lines should be drawn in public policy and\nprofessional practice, against particular degrees of\nenhancement, like \u201cspecies-altering interventions\u201d (Annas,\nAndrews and Isasi, 2002) or \u201cradical enhancements\u201d (Agar\n2013). The assumption here is that the moral problems raised by\nenhancement intensify as the enhanced move away from the human norm,\nand that a threshold can be identified beyond which prohibition would\nbe merited. Since drawing the line at all enhancement uses of\nmedical technologies would founder against too many contentious\nborderline and benign cases, this threshold is usually set at the\nboundary of our species identity, between the human and the\npost-human. As we have seen, this leaves many problematic\nenhancements in particular settings\u2014like \u201cgene\ndoping\u201d in sports\u2014unaddressed, and it is still not clear\nwhat moral salience sheer taxonomy can have, apart from other ethical\nconsiderations\u2014especially when one recalls the pernicious\npolicies other human taxonomies have supported in the past. In\npractice, such an approach would face all the classic line-drawing\nproblems, and the classic challenges of policing and enforcing\nprohibitions in a pluralistic and globalized society. Most importantly,\nhowever, if it is only those alterations that literally produce new\nbiological species that are of concern the vast bulk of potentially\nproblematic enhancement modifications would not fall within the\njurisdiction of this approach. \nAt the other extreme are those who support a libertarian position,\neschewing any blanket public regulation of enhancement in favor of\nfree markets involving those who would develop enhancement\ninterventions and individuals who would use them (Engelhardt 1990;\nFlanigan 2017). But this extreme position suffers the familiar\ndrawbacks of unregulated market economies: a toleration of severely\nharmful transactions (e.g., purchasing tickets to a match of\ngladiatorial combat), the exacerbation of economic inequalities, and a\npermissive stance to transactions with long-term adverse consequences,\nwhich lead to \u201ctragedies of the commons\u201d and environmental\ndevastation. As a result, even the more permissive authors qualify\ntheir \u201cutopian eugenics\u201d proposals with the sorts of\nregulatory protections that surround other consumer products in\nfree-market societies, in terms of safety, fraud, fair pricing and\nenvironmental protection (Bostrom 2003), and argue that the political\njustifications for those policies should support equivalent social\ncontrols for enhancement interventions (Kitcher 1997; Harris\n2007). Even with minimal legal regulations in place to ensure that\nmarkets for biomedical enhancement technologies will be\n\u201cfree\u201d, the libertarian emphasis on the legal\npermissibility of these transactions is a blunt instrument for dealing\nwith the subtle ethical complexities involved in deciding whether to\nuse a particular enhancement technology.\nBetween the extreme positions of prohibition or an open market is a\nmoderate position, which grounds enhancement policy in three of the\nobservations we have made in our conceptual and ethical analyses\nabove:\nFirst, policy will need to focus on governing the uses of technology\nrather than preventing its development in the first place. This is\nbecause of the conceptual flexibility of the boundary between\nenhancement and treatment. Almost all potential enhancement\ninterventions will be developed first as interventions to treat or\nprevent human health problems, pursuing goals that will easily offset\ntheir potential unethical applications. Beyond that, even to\nassess the potential harms of enhancement applications of approved\nmedical interventions will require research, even if it also helps pave\nthe way for their use. This means that interventions capable of being\nused for enhancements will be inevitably invented and perfected as\nby-products of biomedical scientific progress, and their social control\nwill have to focus on governing their dangerous, unjust or vicious uses\n(Mehlman 1999).\nSecond, there are at least two possible responses to harmful\ninterventions, and policy-makers should keep both in mind. If one\nwon\u2019t work, the other approach may. On the one hand, one\ncan try to police and punish unauthorized uses of technology, or\nalternatively one can focus on protecting the interests of those\ndisadvantaged by those uses. Thus, in sports, authorities screen for\nand punish \u201cdoping\u201d athletes, because they cannot fix the\nessential genetic injustice of the spirit of sport. In the workplace\nand in higher education, on the other hand, there may be more concern\nto reduce the competitive stresses that would tempt people to rely on\nstimulants rather than their native talents. In families and schools,\nmoreover, allowances are often made for those less capable in some\ndomains, like sports or music, in order to compensate for their\ndisadvantages there by enabling them to flourish in others. Affirmative\nAction campaigns, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other civil\nrights policies also attempt to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d\nin ways that compensate for disadvantaging biological differences\nrather than attempting to regulate the differences themselves. If we\nare not interested in policing the enhancement uses of biomedical\ntechnology, we may want to explore whether strategies like these might\nwork to undercut the incentives to enhance in unethical ways.\nOne trap that some authors have fallen into in pursuing this\ncompensatory course is to try to use the enhancement shovel to dig out\nof the enhancement hole. Worried that an unregulated surge in\nbiomedical enhancement might open the door to injustice and social\nharm, some are now arguing that the prerequisite for widespread access\nto enhancement should be the widespread enhancement of our moral\nfaculties. Improved moral discernment and reasoning, keener senses of\nempathy and fairness, and deeper sense of solidarity, it is argued,\nwill help mitigate the potential social harms by insuring that the\nusers of enhancement are equipped to do so responsibly (Tennison, 2012;\nPersson and Savulescu 2012).\nThe irony of this argument, of course, is that accomplishing these\nprerequisite moral upgrades would require a social gate-keeping system\nas intrusive and draconian as any attempts to police the use of\nparticular enhancements themselves (Sparrow 2014b; Harris 2016;\nAzevedo 2016). It would also open to debate the criteria by which such\nmoral upgrades would be made (Joyce 2013; Craigie 2014; Wiseman 2016;\nHauskeller and Coyne 2018; Johnson, Bishop and Toner 2019; Paulo and\nBublitz 2019). Would we still allow the enhanced to follow normal\nviews of when the obligatory becomes supererogatory, or expect more of\nthem?  Presumably, we need not aspire to require superhuman virtues,\nsuch as angels might possess. But should they at least be saints?\nAgainst whose account of sainthood? Once again, the panorama of\nalternative philosophical traditions opens up for exploration down\nthis road, offering no quick resolution for policy.\nHowever, it is worth remembering at this point that particular\nbiomedical enhancements will never yield comprehensive improvements in\nmoral character, if only because moral character is not reducible to\nits biological substrates in people\u2019s brains and\ngenes. Instead, enhancement will at best be able to change\nspecific biological functions in ways that improve the chances that a\nperson will act in a particular manner, like telling the truth, at the\nexpense of reducing the chances of some other reaction, like lying,\nwhich, in particular circumstances, may actually be the more virtuous\nthing to do. This piecemeal, double-edged feature of biomedical\nenhancement means that every morally enhancing intervention runs the\nrisk of being a morally disabling intervention at the same\ntime.\nThis point suggests a third observation from our review: despite\nthe claims of its defenders, biomedical enhancement is not a practice\nthat is not always especially well-suited to a melioristic ethic aimed\nat improving human welfare. Often a step forward for some purposes is\nalso a step back in other contexts. Many enhanced people are\ncorrespondingly disabled, and so by extension are their teams,\nfamilies, communities, etc. Consider, for example, an enhancement that\nmakes our reflexes faster.  Such an enhancement might increase the\nrisk of making mistakes in ways that would be considered an acceptable\ntrade-off for military pilots on solo combat missions, but not for\ncommercial pilots ferrying hundreds of passengers. If our policies\nwere to focus on reminding us that most enhancements come with\ntrade-offs, we might be able to orient our public policy away from\neither regulatory or compensatory approaches keyed to\n\u201cenhancement\u201d in the abstract, and towards the specific\nsocial and institutional contexts in which particular enhancement\ninterventions might be considered too risky or unfair.  Should, for\nexample, the Air Force consider the post-service consequences of a\nhyper-reflex enhancement for pilots in deciding whether to adopt such\nan intervention? Should enhanced veterans be able to claim\naccommodation from employers for their service-induced\nhyper-responsiveness?\nFocusing on trade-offs does not imply that no change is the best\npolicy; there is nothing sacred about the biology we inherit. Some\nenhancements may well be worth attendant deficits in particular\nsituations for particular individuals. But just as our inherited\nbiology provides no definitive criteria for \u201chuman nature\u201d\nthat can be used to curtail enhancement, enhancement cannot take our\nfuture biology down any path that offers unequivocal improvement in\nthe human condition.\nBut would a pluralistic and piecemeal approach to governing the\nenhancement uses of medical technologies serve the broader needs of\ndistributive justice with respect to enhancement interventions that\nare deemed acceptable in particular settings? As the enhanced use\ntheir improved capacities to gain power, wealth and status, justice\nmight require that access to those enhancements be afforded more\nbroadly, at least for those willing to bear the corresponding deficits\n(Sparrow 2016). Some authors have argued that a fair system of\nallocating enhancement opportunities will require a centralized,\nglobal agency akin to the World Trade Organization or the\nInternational Monetary Fund, capable of adjudicating all the interests\ninvolved (Buchanan 2011). But the assumption behind such proposals\nremains that \u201cenhancements\u201d will always give people\nfungible advantages over others, like wealth does. It remains to be\nseen how true this is.\nUnderstanding that enhancements are specific, often double-edged\nchanges\u2014beneficial in some settings for some purposes but not in\nothers\u2014suggests that a better analogy here may be the governance\nof health care itself. Good health care on the one hand and\npower, wealth and status on the other are positively correlated,\nthrough the expanded opportunity range that meeting specific health\nneeds can provide. That correlation helps support the case for\nequitable access to health care. But not all health care needs are\nequally \u201cprofitable\u201d in leveraging other social goods, and\nit is not the goal of a needs-based health care system to address\nthat disparity. Just as a fair system of health care\nshould be able to provide need-based access to specific therapeutic\ninterventions, a fair biomedical enhancement allocation system should\nbe geared to needs of people facing particular life challenges. In\nfact, in the end, as this tour of the enhancement literature suggests,\nwith sufficient renegotiation of the boundaries of health care, it\ncould be the same system. Again, the task of realizing\nsuch a system will continue to be daunting. But it is doubtful that\nthis will require a Brave New World of centralized global moral\nenhancement schemes: instead, managing our emerging biomedical\nenhancement abilities begins with the tedious real world tasks of\nlearning to live with human difference and meet human needs.\n",
