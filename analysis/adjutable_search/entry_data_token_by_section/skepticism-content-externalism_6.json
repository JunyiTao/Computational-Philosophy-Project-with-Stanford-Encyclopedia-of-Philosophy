    "main_text": "A Simple Argument.\n7. A Simple Argument.\n\nBrueckner goes on in his 2003 to consider what he would later (2016)\ncall a modified version of Simple Argument 1 or SA1:\n\n\nA. If I am a BIV, then my word\n\u2018tree\u2019 does not refer to trees.\n\nB. My word \u2018tree\u2019 refers to\ntrees.\n\n\u2234 C. I am not a BIV.\n\n\nBrueckner (2016) suggests that premise B begs the question, since its\ntruth requires the existence of trees as referents for his word\n\u2018tree\u2019. So to know that B is true, he would have to know\nthat he is \u201ca non-BIV in a world containing trees, rather than a\nBIV in a treeless vat world\u201d (Brueckner 2016: 5).\n\nTo avoid this objection, Brueckner suggests the following modification\nof SA1 (2003: 158, 2016: 5):\n\n\nA*. If I am a BIV, then it is not the case\nthat if my word \u2018tree\u2019 refers, then it refers to\ntrees.\n\nB*. If my word \u2018tree\u2019 refers,\nthen it refers to trees.\n\n\u2234 C. I am not a BIV.\n\n\nBrueckner claims that B* can be true even if there are no trees, so\nthat use of it here does not beg the question.\n\nHowever, given widely held direct reference views of proper names,\nindexicals, and natural kind terms, views that are strongly suggested\nby the work of Kripke (1972), Kaplan (1977 [1989]), and Putnam (1975),\nit is not obvious that the existential commitments of sentences\ncontaining such terms can be removed by merely conditionalizing or\n\u2018hedging\u2019 the sentences. (For a useful discussion of\nhedging see Yeakel 2016.)\n\n\u2018Tree\u2019 is a natural kind term. As such, it is plausible to\nsuppose that this term\u2019s primary semantic function is that of\npredicating membership in the kind T to which all trees belong. But\nsuppose that there is no such kind T. In this case, the general term\n\u2018tree\u2019 would have no semantic value, since there simply\nwould be no such property as that of belonging to T. As a consequence,\nBrueckner\u2019s premise B* would express no proposition and would\nhave no truth value, since the term \u2018tree\u2019 would make no\nsemantic contribution to what is said by B*. Thus, in order for\npremise B* to express a truth, there must be a natural kind T to which\nall trees belong, and so Brueckner\u2019s claim that B* can be true\neven if there are no trees seems doubtful.\n\nWe should again note that use of premise (A*) begs the question for\nthe same reason that was pointed out by Hale (2000) regarding\nWright\u2019s (1992) reconstruction.\n",
