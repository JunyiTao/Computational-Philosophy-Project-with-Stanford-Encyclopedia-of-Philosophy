Substance and \u201cMatter\u201d\n\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics was developed within, and in part as a\nreaction to the mechanical philosophy of the mid-to-late 17th century,\nrevived by Galileo, Descartes, Gassendi, Boyle, Newton, and Locke.\nWhile the term \u201csubstance,\u201d meaning the indestructible\nstuff of the universe, was retained by Descartes in his discussions of\nres extensa, the mechanical philosophers adopted a\ncorpuscularian theory in which objects were temporary aggregates of\nsolid, indestructible particles with various figures and motions, and\nmost though by no means all change occurred through their contact,\npressure, collision, entangling, and so on. Leibniz contested the\ncorpuscularian image, insisting that it was insufficiently profound\nand inherently self-contradictory (G 4: 480), and holding that matter\nwas a \u2018phenomenon\u2019 founded upon the reality of\n\u201cmetaphysical points\u201d or, as he later termed them, monads:\nqualitatively unique,indestructible and indivisible units that also\nperceived and strove (G 6: 608).\n\nKant accused Leibniz, along with Spinoza, of \u2018taking appearances\nfor things in themselves\u2019 (KRV A264/B320). One can see his\npoint with respect to water droplets as noted, but it is nevertheless\na somewhat mixed-up claim. As Kant understood him, in failing to\ndistinguish between intellectual representation and sensory\nperception, Leibniz believed we saw aggregates of monads as empirical\nobjects. But Leibniz distinguished sharply between the everyday\nperceptual world of living beings and inanimate objects and the\ninvisible monadic order. Unextended monads were non causally\ninteracting but enjoyed (in a confusedly omniscient manner) the\nuniversal pre-established harmony of perceptions, while empirical\nhumans perceived individually subvisible empirical objects such as\nanimalcula and fine powders through causal mechanisms in a confused\nmanner (GM III:546\u20137; AG IV:426). But Leibniz was not clear about how\nthe unextended monads projected into a visible world and neither were\nhis later commentators. After his critical turn, Kant had decided that\n\u201cthings in themselves\u201d that compose external reality are\nnot perceived at all. They are not in causal contact with us, though\nthey affect us in such a way that we experience a sensory world\nstructured according to the categories of time, space, causality and\nobjecthood. The impact driven, push and pull of the appearances\ntherefore did not, in Kant\u2019s view, preclude the possibility of\nthe origination of free actions by a noumenal subject. \n\nMatter, Kant could readily agree with Leibniz, cannot be a thing in\nitself, stuff possessed of characteristics and qualities independent\nof human perception; what we call matter is an appearance (4:507). The\ntrue nature of mind-independent external reality cannot be described\nby reference to shape, contact or movement, which characterize only\nthe objects presented to us (A265\u20136/B 321\u20132). He understood\nLeibniz\u2019s reasoning in favour of monads as follows: It is\nimpossible to conceive two material atoms as both different\nfrom one another and as simple, i.e partless; yet possible to conceive\ntwo souls that are both different and partless (20:285). Therefore, if\nsubstances are manifold and partless, they must have representational\ncapacities. The crucial error in this reasoning lay in supposing that\nour abstract conceptions are a guide to reality behind the\nspatio-temporal appearances. Yet properly understood, he maintained,\nLeibniz\u2019s monadology was not an attempt to explain appearances\nbut the expression of a \u201cPlatonic\u201d view of the world,\nconsidered apart from our sensory experience of it (4:507; 8:248). In\nthis regard, he did grasp that Leibniz did not after all take\nappearances for things in themselves.\n\nDespite his warnings about the limited powers of human reason, Kant\ntoo believed it possible to deduce some features of matter, as\nphysical science must theorize it, a priori. There are no\nmaterial atoms; matter is divisible to infinity and its parts are all\nmaterial (4:503f). Yet Kant recognized, first in the Physical\nMonadology, then in the Metaphysical Foundations,\nparticles in the form of centres of attractive and repulsive forces\nthat account for the space-filling property and impenetrability of\nmatter (4: 533ff). This relatively dogmatic treatment co-exists with\nhis critical claim that matter is the appearance of a perfectly\nunknown substratum. As he explains it in the Critique of Pure\nReason, the rainbow is a mere appearance relative to rain drops\nwhich, in a physical sense, are things-in-themselves and not mirages.\nYet thinking further, we realize that the raindrops too are mere\nappearances, and that \u201ceven their round form, indeed, even the\nspace through which they fall are nothing in themselves, but only mere\nmodifications or foundations of our sensible intuition; the\ntranscendental object, however, remains unknown to us.\u201d (KRV A\n45f/B 63f). \u201cAbout these appearances, further, much may be said\na priori that concerns their form but nothing whatsoever about the\nthings in themselves that may ground them.\u201d (KRV A49/B66). This\nsuggests that the stuff which is divisible to infinity and bears\nattractive and repulsive forces is an appearance of something unknown\nand unknowable. \u201cWe can understand nothing except what brings\nwith it something in intuition corresponding to our words. When we\ncomplain that we do not see into the inner nature of things, this can\nmean no more than that we cannot grasp, through pure reason, what the\nthings that appear to us might be in themselves\u2026. Observation\nand division with respect to the appearances take us into the interior\nof nature, and we cannot say how far this will proceed. But every\ntranscendental question that takes us beyond [perceptible] nature can\nnever be answered\u2026\u201d (KRV (A277f/B333f).\n",
