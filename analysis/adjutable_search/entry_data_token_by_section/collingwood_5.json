    "main_text": "Metaphilosophy || The metaphilosophical battle with Ayer\n2.5 The metaphilosophical battle with Ayer\n\nIn the debate with Ryle which unfolded on the pages of Mind\nand in the private correspondence Collingwood had tried to defend the\nclaim that there is a distinctive kind of proposition which captures\nthe subject matter of philosophy, but his attempt to capture the\ndistinctive subject matter of philosophical analysis was dismissed by\nRyle as being of a piece with a dusty old metaphysics. The drastic\nchange of terminology in An Essay on Metaphysics is at least\nin part an attempt to defend the claim that philosophy has a\ndistinctive subject matter different from both that of the exact and\nthe natural sciences, but to do so in a way that would not lend itself\nto the kind of misunderstanding that led Ryle to dismiss\nCollingwood\u2019s metaphilosophical vision as belonging to an\nidealist metaphysics of the sort that analytic philosophy wanted to\nleave behind. This terminological change put Collingwood in a better\nposition to engage with the revival of empiricism at the hands of A.J.\nAyer. In Language Truth and Logic (1936) Ayer revitalised\nHume\u2019s critique of metaphysics by invoking the principle of\nverifiability, according to which propositions are meaningful insofar\nas they are empirically verifiable. Propositions which are not\nempirically verifiable are nonsense unless they are tautologies. As\nfar as Collingwood was concerned Ayer\u2019s revival of the Humean\nfork had unpalatable metaphilosophical implications because it\nentailed that to be meaningful the claims of philosophy must be either\nempirically verifiable, as the propositions of natural science, or\nanalytic truths, as the propositions of exact science. An Essay on\nMetaphysics is a pointed attack on the metaphilosophical\nimplications of this claim. Ayer\u2019s commitment to the view that\nthere are only two types of legitimate propositions, empirical and\nanalytic, was, for Collingwood, based on a failure to acknowledge that\nstatements can play different roles in the logic of question and\nanswer. Some statements are answers to questions and, in so far as\ntheir role is to answer questions, they are truth evaluable. But some\nstatements have a different role, namely, to give rise to questions\nand they perform this role not in so far as they are true or false,\nbut in so far as they are presupposed. As such they are not truth\nevaluable, because they are not asserted as propositional answers to\nquestions. Statements such as \u201ca cause is an event by producing\nor preventing which one can produce or prevent that whose cause it is\nsaid to be\u201d (sense II of causation) is not asserted by the\nphilosopher as a proposition. What the philosopher asserts is not\n\u201ccauses in sense II exist or are true of an inquiry independent\nreality\u201d (which would be an illegitimate metaphysical\nproposition) but rather \u201ccauses in sense II are absolutely\npresupposed in the practical sciences of nature\u201d. Philosophy\nyields not first order knowledge but second order knowledge or\nunderstanding of the presuppositions on which knowledge rests.\nAyer\u2019s classification of propositions along the lines of the\nHuman fork conflates presuppositions with propositions and, as a\nresult, fails to acknowledge that philosophy has a distinctive subject\nmatter, namely absolute presuppositions, and a distinctive role, to\ndetect presuppositions. Absolute presuppositions are not reducible\neither to the propositions of the exact or those of the natural\nsciences. Nor are they ruled out as meaningless propositions by the\nprinciple of verifiability because, since they are not propositions,\nthe notion of verifiability does not apply to them.\n",
