Implications of Moral Responsibility Skepticism\n\nTurning now to the practical implications of moral responsibility\nskepticism, we can ask, what would happen if we came to accept this\nview? In recent years a small industry has grown up around precisely\nthis question. Since disbelief in moral responsibility would clearly\nhave profound consequences for our interpersonal relationships,\nsociety, morality, meaning, and the law, it\u2019s important to\nquestion whether these consequences would be (on the whole) good or\nbad. Critics of moral responsibility skepticism fear that it would\nundermine morality, leave us unable to adequately deal with criminal\nbehavior, increase anti-social conduct, and/or destroy meaning in\nlife. Moral responsibility skeptics, on the other hand, offer up a\nnumber of different views\u2014including illusionism\n(Smilansky 1999, 2000), disillusionism (Nadelhoffer 2011),\nand optimistic skepticism (e.g., Spinoza 1677 [1985];\nPereboom 1995, 2001, 2002b, 2009, 2011, 2013a, 2014a; Waller 1989,\n1990, 2004, 2006, 2011, 2014; Sommers 2007a,b; Caruso forthcoming-b; N.\nLevy 2011; Vilhauer 2009a,b, 2012, 2013a,b; Milam 2016, 2017; Smuts\n2014; Morris, forthcoming).\n\nIn recent years, empirical attempts have been made to test the\npractical implications of moral responsibility skepticism. One widely\ncited study found that diminishing belief in free will, which is\nostensibly related to moral responsibility, caused participants to\n\u201ccheat\u201d more on a problem solving task (Vohs &\nSchooler 2008). Another study found that participants who were asked\nto read anti-free will prompts behaved more aggressively than\nparticipants exposed to neutral or pro-free will prompts (Baumeister,\nMasicampo, & DeWall 2009). Another indicates that reduction in\nbelief in free will correlated with reduction in monitoring of errors\n(Rigoni, Pourtois, & Brass 2015). And two additional studies found\nthat diminishing free will belief impairs learning from negative\nemotions (Stillman & Baumeister 2010) and causes participants to\nexhibit more negative attitudes toward out-group members (Zhao, Liu,\nZhang, Shi, & Huang 2014). Such findings seem to suggest that\ndiminished belief in free will and moral responsibility would indeed\nhave negative consequences. Yet such a sweeping conclusion may be too\nhasty.\n\nFirst, some have criticized these studies on philosophical and\nmethodological grounds (see, e.g., Miles 2013; Caruso, forthcoming-b;\nMorris, forthcoming). The \u201ccheating\u201d study, for instance,\nhas failed to replicate on a number of occasions (Carey & Roston\n2015; Open Science Collaboration 2015; Zwaan 2013\n[see Other Internet Resources]) and the passages\nused to prompt anti-free will belief have been criticized for not\nbeing representative of what most free will and moral responsibility\nskeptics claim (Morris, forthcoming). There is also the question of\nwhether the negative effects tested in these studies indicate anything\nabout the long-term consequences of moral responsibility\nskepticism. Most of these effects are short-lived and temporary. But\nas people become more acquainted with the skeptical perspective, and\nas they come to understand what it does and does not maintain, it\nremains possible that these effects would fade over time.  Lastly,\nthere is also a growing body of evidence in the opposite direction\nsuggesting that certain positive effects may follow from free\nwill and moral responsibility skepticism (Carey & Paulhus 2013;\nNadelhoffer & Tocchetto 2013; Krueger et al. 2014; Shariff et\nal. 2014; Caspar et al.  2017).\n\nA recent study by Shariff et al. (2014), for instance, found that\npeople with weaker belief in free will endorsed less retributive\nattitudes regarding punishment of criminals, yet their\nconsequentialist attitudes about punishment were unaffected. They also\nfound that learning about the neural bases of human behavior, either\nthrough reading popular science articles or taking an undergraduate\nneuroscience course, similarly reduced people\u2019s support for\nretributive punishment. The same connection between belief in free\nwill and increased punitiveness has also been found in a number of\nother studies (see, e.g., Carey & Paulhus 2013; Clark et al. 2014;\nAspinwall, Brown, & Tabery 2012; Pizarro, Uhlmann, & Salovey\n2003). Additional studies have found that\nwhere belief in free will is strongest we find increased\nreligiosity and increased commitment to a cluster of\npotentially dangerous political beliefs and attitudes such as Just\nWorld Belief and Right Wing Authoritarianism (see Carey\n& Paulhus 2013; Nadelhoffer & Tocchetto 2013). The belief in a\njust world, for instance, is the belief that we live in a world where\npeople generally get what they deserve. But stronger commitment to\njust world belief is problematic since it correlates with the tendency\nto blame the victims of misfortunes for their own fate (see Lerner\n& Simmons 1966; Lerner 1965, 1980; Lerner & Miller 1978;\nWagstaff 1983; Furnham & Gunter 1984; Furnham 2003; Harper &\nManasse 1992; Montada 1998).\n\nGiven the mixed results of these empirical studies and the fact that\nthey tell us very little about any long-term consequences of adopting\nthe skeptical perspective, the real-life practical implications of\nmoral responsibility skepticism remain an open question. Perhaps, as\nthese studies indicate, it would have both good and bad\nconsequences. In which case, the practical question would shift to the\noverall balance\u2014i.e., whether, on the whole, the\nconsequences would be good or bad. Or perhaps adopting the skeptical\nperspective would over time reduce or eliminate any initial\nnegative reactions\u2014i.e., after an initial adjustment period,\npeople would come to terms with the new reality and their behavior\nwould normalize. An illustrative analogy might be made here with\nsimilar concerns voiced in the past about disbelief in God. It was\nlong argued (and perhaps still is argued in certain quarters of\nsociety) that if people were to come to disbelieve in God, the moral\nfiber of society would disintegrate and we would see a marked increase\nin anti-social behavior. These fears, however, have not materialized,\nas society has grown more secular over time.\n\nThe debate over the philosophical and practical implications of moral\nresponsibility skepticism nevertheless continues, and there is even\nsome debate among skeptics themselves.\n",
