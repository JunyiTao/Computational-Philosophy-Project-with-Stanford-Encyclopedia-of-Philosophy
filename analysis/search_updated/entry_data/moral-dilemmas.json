    "main_text": "\n1. Examples\n\nIn Book I of Plato\u2019s Republic, Cephalus defines\n\u2018justice\u2019 as speaking the truth and paying one\u2019s\ndebts. Socrates quickly refutes this account by suggesting that it\nwould be wrong to repay certain debts\u2014for example, to return a\nborrowed weapon to a friend who is not in his right mind.\nSocrates\u2019 point is not that repaying debts is without moral\nimport; rather, he wants to show that it is not always right to repay\none\u2019s debts, at least not exactly when the one to whom the debt\nis owed demands repayment. What we have here is a conflict between two\nmoral norms: repaying one\u2019s debts and protecting others from\nharm. And in this case, Socrates maintains that protecting others from\nharm is the norm that takes priority.\n\nNearly twenty-four centuries later, Jean-Paul Sartre described a moral\nconflict the resolution of which was, to many, less obvious than the\nresolution to the Platonic conflict. Sartre (1957) tells of a student\nwhose brother had been killed in the German offensive of 1940. The\nstudent wanted to avenge his brother and to fight forces that he\nregarded as evil. But the student\u2019s mother was living with him,\nand he was her one consolation in life. The student believed that he\nhad conflicting obligations. Sartre describes him as being torn\nbetween two kinds of morality: one of limited scope but certain\nefficacy, personal devotion to his mother; the other of much wider\nscope but uncertain efficacy, attempting to contribute to the defeat\nof an unjust aggressor.\n\nWhile the examples from Plato and Sartre are the ones most commonly\ncited, there are many others. Literature abounds with such cases. In\nAeschylus\u2019s Agamemnon, the protagonist ought to save\nhis daughter and ought to lead the Greek troops to Troy; he ought to\ndo each but he cannot do both. And Antigone, in Sophocles\u2019s play\nof the same name, ought to arrange for the burial of her brother,\nPolyneices, and ought to obey the pronouncements of the city\u2019s\nruler, Creon; she can do each of these things, but not both. Areas of\napplied ethics, such as biomedical ethics, business ethics, and legal\nethics, are also replete with such cases.\n2. The Concept of Moral Dilemmas\n\nWhat is common to the two well-known cases is conflict. In each case,\nan agent regards herself as having moral reasons to do each of two\nactions, but doing both actions is not possible. Ethicists have called\nsituations like these moral dilemmas. The crucial features of\na moral dilemma are these: the agent is required to do each of two (or\nmore) actions; the agent can do each of the actions; but the agent\ncannot do both (or all) of the actions. The agent thus seems condemned\nto moral failure; no matter what she does, she will do something wrong\n(or fail to do something that she ought to do).\n\nThe Platonic case strikes many as too easy to be characterized as a\ngenuine moral dilemma. For the agent\u2019s solution in that case is\nclear; it is more important to protect people from harm than to return\na borrowed weapon. And in any case, the borrowed item can be returned\nlater, when the owner no longer poses a threat to others. Thus in this\ncase we can say that the requirement to protect others from serious\nharm overrides the requirement to repay one\u2019s debts by\nreturning a borrowed item when its owner so demands. When one of the\nconflicting requirements overrides the other, we have a conflict but\nnot a genuine moral dilemma. So in addition to the features mentioned\nabove, in order to have a genuine moral dilemma it must also\nbe true that neither of the conflicting requirements is overridden\n(Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, Chapter 1).\n3. Problems\n\nIt is less obvious in Sartre\u2019s case that one of the requirements\noverrides the other. Why this is so, however, may not be so obvious.\nSome will say that our uncertainty about what to do in this case is\nsimply the result of uncertainty about the consequences. If we were\ncertain that the student could make a difference in defeating the\nGermans, the obligation to join the military would prevail. But if the\nstudent made little difference whatsoever in that cause, then his\nobligation to tend to his mother\u2019s needs would take precedence,\nsince there he is virtually certain to be helpful. Others, though,\nwill say that these obligations are equally weighty, and that\nuncertainty about the consequences is not at issue here.\n\nEthicists as diverse as Kant (1971/1797), Mill (1979/1861), and Ross\n(1930, 1939) have assumed that an adequate moral theory should not\nallow for the possibility of genuine moral dilemmas. Only\nrecently\u2014in the last sixty years or so\u2014have philosophers\nbegun to challenge that assumption. And the challenge can take at\nleast two different forms. Some will argue that it is not\npossible to preclude genuine moral dilemmas. Others will argue\nthat even if it were possible, it is not desirable to do\nso.\n\nTo illustrate some of the debate that occurs regarding whether it is\npossible for any theory to eliminate genuine moral dilemmas, consider\nthe following. The conflicts in Plato\u2019s case and in\nSartre\u2019s case arose because there is more than one moral precept\n(using \u2018precept\u2019 to designate rules and principles), more\nthan one precept sometimes applies to the same situation, and in some\nof these cases the precepts demand conflicting actions. One obvious\nsolution here would be to arrange the precepts, however many there\nmight be, hierarchically. By this scheme, the highest ordered precept\nalways prevails, the second prevails unless it conflicts with the\nfirst, and so on. There are at least two glaring problems with this\nobvious solution, however. First, it just does not seem credible to\nhold that moral rules and principles should be hierarchically ordered.\nWhile the requirements to keep one\u2019s promises and to prevent\nharm to others clearly can conflict, it is far from clear that one of\nthese requirements should always prevail over the other. In\nthe Platonic case, the obligation to prevent harm is clearly stronger.\nBut there can easily be cases where the harm that can be prevented is\nrelatively mild and the promise that is to be kept is very important.\nAnd most other pairs of precepts are like this. This was a point made\nby Ross in The Right and the Good (1930, Chapter 2).\n\nThe second problem with this easy solution is deeper. Even if it were\nplausible to arrange moral precepts hierarchically, situations can\narise in which the same precept gives rise to conflicting obligations.\nPerhaps the most widely discussed case of this sort is taken from\nWilliam Styron\u2019s Sophie\u2019s Choice (1980,\n528\u2013529; see Greenspan 1983 and Tessman 2015, 160\u2013163).\nSophie and her two children are at a Nazi concentration camp. A guard\nconfronts Sophie and tells her that one of her children will be\nallowed to live and one will be killed. But it is Sophie who must\ndecide which child will be killed. Sophie can prevent the death of\neither of her children, but only by condemning the other to be killed.\nThe guard makes the situation even more excruciating by informing\nSophie that if she chooses neither, then both will be killed. With\nthis added factor, Sophie has a morally compelling reason to choose\none of her children. But for each child, Sophie has an apparently\nequally strong reason to save him or her. Thus the same moral precept\ngives rise to conflicting obligations. Some have called such cases\nsymmetrical (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, Chapter 2).\n4. Dilemmas and Consistency\n\nWe shall return to the issue of whether it is possible to preclude\ngenuine moral dilemmas. But what about the desirability of doing so?\nWhy have ethicists thought that their theories should preclude the\npossibility of dilemmas? At the intuitive level, the existence of\nmoral dilemmas suggests some sort of inconsistency. An agent caught in\na genuine dilemma is required to do each of two acts but cannot do\nboth. And since he cannot do both, not doing one is a condition of\ndoing the other. Thus, it seems that the same act is both required and\nforbidden. But exposing a logical inconsistency takes some work; for\ninitial inspection reveals that the inconsistency intuitively felt is\nnot present. Allowing \\(OA\\) to designate that the agent in question\nought to do \\(A\\) (or is morally obligated to do \\(A\\), or is morally\nrequired to do \\(A)\\), that \\(OA\\) and \\(OB\\) are both true is not\nitself inconsistent, even if one adds that it is not possible for the\nagent to do both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). And even if the situation is\nappropriately described as \\(OA\\) and \\(O\\neg A\\), that is not a\ncontradiction; the contradictory of \\(OA\\) is \\(\\neg OA\\). (See Marcus\n1980 and McConnell 1978, 273.)\n\nSimilarly rules that generate moral dilemmas are not inconsistent, at\nleast on the usual understanding of that term. Ruth Marcus suggests\nplausibly that we \u201cdefine a set of rules as consistent if there\nis some possible world in which they are all obeyable in all\ncircumstances in that world.\u201d Thus, \u201crules are\nconsistent if there are possible circumstances in which no conflict\nwill emerge,\u201d and \u201ca set of rules is inconsistent if there\nare no circumstances, no possible world, in which all the\nrules are satisfiable\u201d (Marcus 1980, 128 and 129). Kant, Mill,\nand Ross were likely aware that a dilemma-generating theory need not\nbe inconsistent. Even so, they would be disturbed if their own\ntheories allowed for such predicaments. If this speculation is\ncorrect, it suggests that Kant, Mill, Ross, and others thought that\nthere is an important theoretical feature that dilemma-generating\ntheories lack. And this is understandable. It is certainly no comfort\nto an agent facing a reputed moral dilemma to be told that at least\nthe rules which generate this predicament are consistent because there\nis a possible world in which they do not conflict. For a good\npractical example, consider the situation of the criminal defense\nattorney. She is said to have an obligation to hold in confidence the\ndisclosures made by a client and to be required to conduct herself\nwith candor before the court (where the latter requires that the\nattorney inform the court when her client commits perjury) (Freedman\n1975, Chapter 3). It is clear that in this world these two obligations\noften conflict. It is equally clear that in some possible\nworld\u2014for example, one in which clients do not commit\nperjury\u2014that both obligations can be satisfied. Knowing this is\nof no assistance to defense attorneys who face a conflict between\nthese two requirements in this world.\n\nEthicists who are concerned that their theories not allow for moral\ndilemmas have more than consistency in mind. What is troubling is that\ntheories that allow for dilemmas fail to be uniquely\naction-guiding. A theory is appropriately action-guiding if it\nassesses an agent\u2019s options as either forbidden, (merely) permissible,\nor obligatory (or, possibly, supererogatory). If more than one action\nis right, then the agent\u2019s obligation is to do any one of the right\nacts. A theory can fail to be uniquely action-guiding in either of two\nways: by recommending incompatible actions in a situation or by not\nrecommending any action at all. Theories that generate genuine moral\ndilemmas fail to be uniquely action-guiding in the former way.\nTheories that have no way, even in principle, of determining what an\nagent should do in a particular situation have what Thomas E. Hill,\nJr. calls \u201cgaps\u201d (Hill 1996, 179\u2013183); they fail to\nbe action-guiding in the latter way. Since one of the main points of\nmoral theories is to provide agents with guidance, that suggests that\nit is desirable for theories to eliminate dilemmas and gaps, at least\nif doing so is possible.\n\nBut failing to be uniquely action-guiding is not the only reason that\nthe existence of moral dilemmas is thought to be troublesome. Just as\nimportant, the existence of dilemmas does lead to inconsistencies if\ncertain other widely held theses are true. Here we shall consider two\ndifferent arguments, each of which shows that one cannot consistently\nacknowledge the reality of moral dilemmas while holding selected (and\nseemingly plausible) principles.\n\nThe first argument shows that two standard principles of deontic logic\nare, when conjoined, incompatible with the existence of moral\ndilemmas. The first of these is the principle of deontic\nconsistency \n\\[\\tag{PC}\nOA \\rightarrow \\neg O\\neg A.\n\\]\n\n\nIntuitively this principle just says that the same action cannot be\nboth obligatory and forbidden. Note that as initially described, the\nexistence of dilemmas does not conflict with PC. For as described,\ndilemmas involve a situation in which an agent ought to do \\(A\\),\nought to do \\(B\\), but cannot do both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). But if we add a\nprinciple of deontic logic, then we obtain a conflict with\nPC: \n\\[\\tag{PD}\n\\Box(A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow(OA \\rightarrow OB).\n\\]\n\n\nIntuitively, PD just says that if doing \\(A\\) brings about \\(B\\), and\nif \\(A\\) is obligatory (morally required), then \\(B\\) is obligatory\n(morally required). The first argument that generates\ninconsistency can now be stated. Premises (1), (2), and (3) represent\nthe claim that moral dilemmas exist. \n\n\n1.\n\\(OA\\)\n\n\n2.\n\\(OB\\)\n\n\n3.\n\\(\\neg C (A \\amp B)\\)\n[where \u2018\\(\\neg C\\)\u2019 means\n\u2018cannot\u2019]\n\n4.\n\\(\\Box(A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow(OA \\rightarrow OB)\\)\n[where \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 means physical\nnecessity]\n\n5.\n\\(\\Box \\neg(B \\amp A)\\)\n(from 3)\n\n6.\n\\(\\Box(B \\rightarrow \\neg A)\\)\n(from 5)\n\n7.\n\\(\\Box(B \\rightarrow \\neg A) \\rightarrow(OB \\rightarrow O\\neg\nA)\\)\n(an instantiation of 4)\n\n8.\n\\(OB \\rightarrow O\\neg A\\)\n(from 6 and 7)\n\n9.\n\\(O\\neg A\\)\n(from 2 and 8)\n\n10.\n\\(OA \\text{ and } O\\neg A\\)\n(from 1 and 9)\n\n\nLine (10) directly conflicts with PC. And from PC and (1), we can\nconclude:\n\n\n11.\n\\(\\neg O\\neg A\\)\n\n\nAnd, of course, (9) and (11) are contradictory. So if we assume PC and\nPD, then the existence of dilemmas generates an inconsistency of the\nold-fashioned logical sort. (Note: In standard deontic logic, the\n\u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 in PD typically designates logical necessity.\nHere I take it to indicate physical necessity so that the appropriate\nconnection with premise (3) can be made. And I take it that logical\nnecessity is stronger than physical necessity.)\n\nTwo other principles accepted in most systems of deontic logic entail\nPC. So if PD holds, then one of these additional two principles must\nbe jettisoned too. The first says that if an action is obligatory, it\nis also permissible. The second says that an action is permissible if\nand only if it is not forbidden. These principles may be stated\nas: \n\\[\\tag{OP}\nOA \\rightarrow PA;\n\\]\n\n\nand  \n\\[\\tag{D}\nPA \\leftrightarrow \\neg O\\neg A.\n\\]\n\n\nPrinciples OP and D are basic; they seem to be conceptual truths\n(Brink 1994, section IV). From these two principles, one can deduce\nPC, which gives it additional support.\n\nThe second argument that generates inconsistency, like the\nfirst, has as its first three premises a symbolic representation of a\nmoral dilemma.\n\n\n1.\n\\(OA\\)\n\n2.\n\\(OB\\)\n\n3.\n\\(\\neg C (A \\amp B)\\)\n\n\nAnd like the first, this second argument shows that the existence of\ndilemmas leads to a contradiction if we assume two other commonly\naccepted principles. The first of these principles is that\n\u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019. Intuitively this says\nthat if an agent is morally required to do an action, it must be\nwithin the agent\u2019s power to do it. This principle seems necessary if\nmoral judgments are to be uniquely action-guiding. We may represent\nthis as\n\n\n4.\n\\(OA \\rightarrow CA\\)\n(for all \\(A\\))\n\n\nThe other principle, endorsed by most systems of deontic logic, says\nthat if an agent is required to do each of two actions, she is\nrequired to do both. We may represent this as \n\n\n5.\n\\((OA \\amp OB) \\rightarrow O(A\\amp B)\\)\n(for all \\(A\\) and all \\(B\\))\n\n\nThe argument then proceeds: \n\n\n6.\n\\(O(A \\amp B) \\rightarrow C(A \\amp B)\\)\n(an instance of 4)\n\n7.\n\\(OA \\amp OB\\)\n(from 1 and 2)\n\n8.\n\\(O(A \\amp B)\\)\n(from 5 and 7)\n\n9.\n\\(\\neg O(A \\amp B)\\)\n(from 3 and 6)\n\n\nSo if one assumes that \u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019\nand if one assumes the principle represented in (5)\u2014dubbed by\nsome the agglomeration principle (Williams 1965)\u2014then again a\ncontradiction can be derived.\n5. Responses to the Arguments\n\nNow obviously the inconsistency in the first argument can be avoided\nif one denies either PC or PD. And the inconsistency in the second\nargument can be averted if one gives up either the principle that\n\u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019 or the agglomeration\nprinciple. There is, of course, another way to avoid these\ninconsistencies: deny the possibility of genuine moral dilemmas. It is\nfair to say that much of the debate concerning moral dilemmas in the\nlast sixty years has been about how to avoid the inconsistencies\ngenerated by the two arguments above.\n\nOpponents of moral dilemmas have generally held that the crucial\nprinciples in the two arguments above are conceptually true, and\ntherefore we must deny the possibility of genuine dilemmas. (See, for\nexample, Conee 1982 and Zimmerman 1996.) Most of the debate, from all\nsides, has focused on the second argument. There is an oddity about\nthis, however. When one examines the pertinent principles in each\nargument which, in combination with dilemmas, generates an\ninconsistency, there is little doubt that those in the first argument\nhave a greater claim to being conceptually true than those in the\nsecond. (One who recognizes the salience of the first argument is\nBrink 1994, section V.) Perhaps the focus on the second argument is\ndue to the impact of Bernard Williams\u2019s influential essay\n(Williams 1965). But notice that the first argument shows that if\nthere are genuine dilemmas, then either PC or PD must be relinquished.\nEven most supporters of dilemmas acknowledge that PC is quite basic.\nE.J. Lemmon, for example, notes that if PC does not hold in a system\nof deontic logic, then all that remains are truisms and paradoxes\n(Lemmon 1965, p. 51). And giving up PC also requires denying either OP\nor D, each of which also seems basic. There has been much debate about\nPD\u2014in particular, questions generated by the Good Samaritan\nparadox\u2014but still it seems basic. So those who want to argue\nagainst dilemmas purely on conceptual grounds are better off focusing\non the first of the two arguments above.\n\nSome opponents of dilemmas also hold that the pertinent principles in\nthe second argument\u2014the principle that \u2018ought\u2019\nimplies \u2018can\u2019 and the agglomeration principle\u2014are\nconceptually true. But foes of dilemmas need not say this. Even if\nthey believe that a conceptual argument against dilemmas can be made\nby appealing to PC and PD, they have several options regarding the\nsecond argument. They may defend \u2018ought\u2019 implies\n\u2018can\u2019, but hold that it is a substantive normative\nprinciple, not a conceptual truth. Or they may even deny the truth of\n\u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019 or the agglomeration\nprinciple, though not because of moral dilemmas, of course.\n\nDefenders of dilemmas need not deny all of the pertinent principles.\nIf one thinks that each of the principles at least has some initial\nplausibility, then one will be inclined to retain as many as possible.\nAmong the earlier contributors to this debate, some took the existence\nof dilemmas as a counterexample to \u2018ought\u2019 implies\n\u2018can\u2019 (for example, Lemmon 1962 and Trigg 1971); others,\nas a refutation of the agglomeration principle (for example, Williams\n1965 and van Fraassen 1973). A common response to the first argument\nis to deny PD. A more complicated response is to grant that the\ncrucial deontic principles hold, but only in ideal worlds. In the real\nworld, they have heuristic value, bidding agents in conflict cases to\nlook for permissible options, though none may exist (Holbo 2002,\nespecially sections 15\u201317).\n\nFriends and foes of dilemmas have a burden to bear in responding to\nthe two arguments above. For there is at least a prima facie\nplausibility to the claim that there are moral dilemmas and to the\nclaim that the relevant principles in the two arguments are true. Thus\neach side must at least give reasons for denying the pertinent claims\nin question. Opponents of dilemmas must say something in response to\nthe positive arguments that are given for the reality of such\nconflicts. One reason in support of dilemmas, as noted above, is\nsimply pointing to examples. The case of Sartre\u2019s student and\nthat from Sophie\u2019s Choice are good ones; and clearly\nthese can be multiplied indefinitely. It will tempting for supporters\nof dilemmas to say to opponents, \u201cIf this is not a real dilemma,\nthen tell me what the agent ought to do and\nwhy?\u201d It is obvious, however, that attempting to answer\nsuch questions is fruitless, and for at least two reasons. First, any\nanswer given to the question is likely to be controversial, certainly\nnot always convincing. And second, this is a game that will never end;\nexample after example can be produced. The more appropriate response\non the part of foes of dilemmas is to deny that they need to answer\nthe question. Examples as such cannot establish the reality of\ndilemmas. Surely most will acknowledge that there are situations in\nwhich an agent does not know what he ought to do. This may be because\nof factual uncertainty, uncertainty about the consequences,\nuncertainty about what principles apply, or a host of other things. So\nfor any given case, the mere fact that one does not know which of two\n(or more) conflicting obligations prevails does not show that none\ndoes.\n\nAnother reason in support of dilemmas to which opponents must respond\nis the point about symmetry. As the cases from Plato and Sartre show,\nmoral rules can conflict. But opponents of dilemmas can argue that in\nsuch cases one rule overrides the other. Most will grant this in the\nPlatonic case, and opponents of dilemmas will try to extend this point\nto all cases. But the hardest case for opponents is the symmetrical\none, where the same precept generates the conflicting requirements.\nThe case from Sophie\u2019s Choice is of this sort. It makes\nno sense to say that a rule or principle overrides itself. So what do\nopponents of dilemmas say here? They are apt to argue that the\npertinent, all-things-considered requirement in such a case is\ndisjunctive: Sophie should act to save one or the other of her\nchildren, since that is the best that she can do (for example,\nZimmerman 1996, Chapter 7). Such a move need not be ad hoc,\nsince in many cases it is quite natural. If an agent can afford to\nmake a meaningful contribution to only one charity, the fact that\nthere are several worthwhile candidates does not prompt many to say\nthat the agent will fail morally no matter what he does. Nearly all of\nus think that he should give to one or the other of the worthy\ncandidates. Similarly, if two people are drowning and an agent is\nsituated so that she can save either of the two but only one, few say\nthat she is doing wrong no matter which person she saves. Positing a\ndisjunctive requirement in these cases seems perfectly natural, and so\nsuch a move is available to opponents of dilemmas as a response to\nsymmetrical cases.\n\nSupporters of dilemmas have a burden to bear too. They need to cast\ndoubt on the adequacy of the pertinent principles in the two arguments\nthat generate inconsistencies. And most importantly, they need to\nprovide independent reasons for doubting whichever of the principles\nthey reject. If they have no reason other than cases of putative\ndilemmas for denying the principles in question, then we have a mere\nstandoff. Of the principles in question, the most commonly questioned\non independent grounds are the principle that \u2018ought\u2019\nimplies \u2018can\u2019 and PD. Among supporters of dilemmas, Walter\nSinnott-Armstrong (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, Chapters 4 and 5) has gone\nto the greatest lengths to provide independent reasons for questioning\nsome of the relevant principles.\n6. Moral Residue and Dilemmas\n\nOne well-known argument for the reality of moral dilemmas has not been\ndiscussed yet. This argument might be called\n\u201cphenomenological.\u201d It appeals to the emotions that agents\nfacing conflicts experience and our assessment of those emotions.\n\nReturn to the case of Sartre\u2019s student. Suppose that he joins\nthe Free French forces. It is likely that he will experience remorse\nor guilt for having abandoned his mother. And not only will he\nexperience these emotions, this moral residue, but it is appropriate\nthat he does. Yet, had he stayed with his mother and not joined the\nFree French forces, he also would have appropriately experienced\nremorse or guilt. But either remorse or guilt is appropriate only if\nthe agent properly believes that he has done something wrong (or\nfailed to do something that he was all-things-considered required to\ndo). Since no matter what the agent does he will appropriately\nexperience remorse or guilt, then no matter what he does he will have\ndone something wrong. Thus, the agent faces a genuine moral dilemma.\n(The best known proponents of arguments for dilemmas that appeal to\nmoral residue are Williams 1965 and Marcus 1980; for a more recent\ncontribution, see Tessman 2015, especially Chapter 2.)\n\nMany cases of moral conflict are similar to Sartre\u2019s example\nwith regard to the agent\u2019s reaction after acting. Certainly the\ncase from Sophie\u2019s Choice fits here. No matter which of\nher children Sophie saves, she will experience enormous guilt for the\nconsequences of that choice. Indeed, if Sophie did not experience such\nguilt, we would think that there was something morally wrong with her.\nIn these cases, proponents of the argument (for dilemmas) from moral\nresidue must claim that four things are true: (1) when the agents\nacts, she experiences remorse or guilt; (2) that she experiences these\nemotions is appropriate and called for; (3) had the agent acted on the\nother of the conflicting requirements, she would also have experienced\nremorse or guilt; and (4) in the latter case these emotions would have\nbeen equally appropriate and called for (McConnell 1996, pp.\n37\u201338). In these situations, then, remorse or guilt will be\nappropriate no matter what the agent does and these emotions are\nappropriate only when the agent has done something wrong. Therefore,\nthese situations are genuinely dilemmatic and moral failure is\ninevitable for agents who face them.\n\nThere is much to say about the moral emotions and situations of moral\nconflict; the positions are varied and intricate. Without pretending\nto resolve all of the issues here, it will be pointed out that\nopponents of dilemmas have raised two different objections to the\nargument from moral residue. The first objection, in effect, suggests\nthat the argument is question-begging (McConnell 1978 and Conee 1982);\nthe second objection challenges the assumption that remorse and guilt\nare appropriate only when the agent has done wrong.\n\nTo explain the first objection, note that it is uncontroversial that\nsome bad feeling or other is called for when an agent is in a\nsituation like that of Sartre\u2019s student or Sophie. But the\nnegative moral emotions are not limited to remorse and guilt. Among\nthese other emotions, consider regret. An agent can appropriately\nexperience regret even when she does not believe that she has done\nsomething wrong. Consider a compelling example provided by Edmund\nSanturri (1987, 46). Under battlefield conditions, an army medic must\nperform a life-saving amputation of a soldier\u2019s leg with insufficient\nanesthetic. She will surely feel intense regret because of the pain\nshe has inflicted, but justifiably she will not feel that she has done\nwrong. Regret can even be appropriate when a person has no causal\nconnection at all with the bad state of affairs. It is appropriate for\nme to regret the damage that a recent fire has caused to my\nneighbor\u2019s house, the pain that severe birth defects cause in\ninfants, and the suffering that a starving animal experiences in the\nwilderness. Not only is it appropriate that I experience regret in\nthese cases, but I would probably be regarded as morally lacking if I\ndid not. (For accounts of moral remainders as they relate specifically\nto Kantianism and virtue ethics, see, respectively, Hill 1996,\n183\u2013187 and Hursthouse 1999, 44\u201348 and 68\u201377.)\n\nWith remorse or guilt, at least two components are present: the\nexperiential component, namely, the negative feeling that the\nagent has; and the cognitive component, namely, the belief\nthat the agent has done something wrong and takes responsibility for\nit. Although this same cognitive component is not part of regret, the\nnegative feeling is. And the experiential component alone cannot serve\nas a gauge to distinguish regret from remorse, for regret can range\nfrom mild to intense, and so can remorse. In part, what distinguishes\nthe two is the cognitive component. But now when we examine the case\nof an alleged dilemma, such as that of Sartre\u2019s student, it is\nquestion-begging to assert that it is appropriate for him to\nexperience remorse no matter what he does. No doubt, it is appropriate\nfor him to experience some negative feeling. To say, however,\nthat it is remorse that is called for is to assume that the agent\nappropriately believes that he has done something wrong. Since regret\nis warranted even in the absence of such a belief, to assume that\nremorse is appropriate is to assume, not argue, that the\nagent\u2019s situation is genuinely dilemmatic. Opponents of dilemmas\ncan say that one of the requirements overrides the other, or that the\nagent faces a disjunctive requirement, and that regret is appropriate\nbecause even when he does what he ought to do, some bad will ensue.\nEither side, then, can account for the appropriateness of some\nnegative moral emotion. To get more specific, however, requires more\nthan is warranted by the present argument. This appeal to moral\nresidue, then, does not by itself establish the reality of moral\ndilemmas.\n\nMatters are even more complicated, though, as the second objection to\nthe argument from moral residue shows. The residues contemplated by\nproponents of the argument are diverse, ranging from guilt or remorse\nto a belief that the agent ought to apologize or compensate persons\nwho were negatively impacted by the fact that he did not satisfy one\nof the conflicting obligations. The argument assumes that experiencing\nremorse or guilt or believing that one ought to apologize or\ncompensate another are appropriate responses only if the agent\nbelieves that he has done something wrong. But this assumption is\ndebatable, for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, even when one obligation clearly overrides another in a\nconflict case, it is often appropriate to apologize to or to explain\noneself to any disadvantaged parties. Ross provides such a case (1930,\n28): one who breaks a relatively trivial promise in order to assist\nsomeone in need should in some way make it up to the promisee. Even\nthough the agent did no wrong, the additional actions promote\nimportant moral values (McConnell 1996, 42\u201344).\n\nSecond, as Simon Blackburn argues, compensation or its like may be\ncalled for even when there was no moral conflict at all (Blackburn\n1996, 135\u2013136). If a coach rightly selected Agnes for the team\nrather than Belinda, she still is likely to talk to Belinda, encourage\nher efforts, and offer tips for improving. This kind of \u201cmaking\nup\u201d is just basic decency.\n\nThird, the consequences of what one has done may be so horrible as to\nmake guilt inevitable. Consider the case of a middle-aged man, Bill,\nand a seven-year-old boy, Johnny. It is set in a midwestern village on\na snowy December day. Johnny and several of his friends are riding\ntheir sleds down a narrow, seldom used street, one that intersects\nwith a busier, although still not heavily traveled, street. Johnny, in\nhis enthusiasm for sledding, is not being very careful. During his\nfinal ride he skidded under an automobile passing through the\nintersection and was killed instantly. The car was driven by Bill.\nBill was driving safely, had the right of way, and was not exceeding\nthe speed limit. Moreover, given the physical arrangement, it would\nhave been impossible for Bill to have seen Johnny coming. Bill was not\nat fault, legally or morally, for Johnny\u2019s death. Yet Bill\nexperienced what can best be described as remorse or guilt about his\nrole in this horrible event (McConnell 1996, 39).\n\nAt one level, Bill\u2019s feelings of remorse or guilt are not\nwarranted. Bill did nothing wrong. Certainly Bill does not deserve to\nfeel guilt (Dahl 1996, 95\u201396). A friend might even recommend\nthat Bill seek therapy. But this is not all there is to say. Most of\nus understand Bill\u2019s response. From Bill\u2019s point of view,\nthe response is not inappropriate, not irrational, not uncalled-for.\nTo see this, imagine that Bill had had a very different response.\nSuppose that Bill had said, \u201cI regret Johnny\u2019s death. It\nis a terrible thing. But it certainly was not my fault. I have nothing\nto feel guilty about and I don\u2019t owe his parents any\napologies.\u201d Even if Bill is correct intellectually, it is hard\nto imagine someone being able to achieve this sort of objectivity\nabout his own behavior. When human beings have caused great harm, it\nis natural for them to wonder if they are at fault, even if to\noutsiders it is obvious that they bear no moral responsibility for the\ndamage. Human beings are not so finely tuned emotionally that when\nthey have been causally responsible for harm, they can easily\nturn guilt on or off depending on their degree of moral\nresponsibility. (See Zimmerman 1988, 134\u2013135.)\n\nWork in moral psychology can help to explain why self-directed moral\nemotions like guilt or remorse are natural when an agent has acted\ncontrary to a moral norm, whether justifiably or not. Many moral\npsychologists describe dual processes in humans for arriving at moral\njudgments (see, for example, Greene 2013, especially Chapters\n4\u20135, and Haidt 2012, especially Chapter 2). Moral emotions are\nautomatic, the brain\u2019s immediate response to a situation. Reason\nis more like the brain\u2019s manual mode, employed when automatic\nsettings are insufficient, such as when norms conflict. Moral emotions\nare likely the product of evolution, reinforcing conduct that promotes\nsocial harmony and disapproving actions that thwart that end. If this\nis correct, then negative moral emotions are apt to be experienced, to\nsome extent, any time an agent\u2019s actions are contrary to what is\nnormally a moral requirement.\n\nSo both supporters and opponents of moral dilemmas can give an account\nof why agents who face moral conflicts appropriately experience\nnegative moral emotions. But there is a complex array of issues\nconcerning the relationship between ethical conflicts and moral\nemotions, and only book-length discussions can do them justice. (See\nGreenspan 1995 and Tessman 2015.)\n7. Types of Moral Dilemmas\n\nIn the literature on moral dilemmas, it is common to draw distinctions\namong various types of dilemmas. Only some of these distinctions will\nbe mentioned here. It is worth noting that both supporters and\nopponents of dilemmas tend to draw some, if not all, of these\ndistinctions. And in most cases the motivation for doing so is clear.\nSupporters of dilemmas may draw a distinction between dilemmas of type\n\\(V\\) and \\(W\\). The upshot is typically a message to opponents of\ndilemmas: \u201cYou think that all moral conflicts are resolvable.\nAnd that is understandable, because conflicts of type \\(V\\) are\nresolvable. But conflicts of type \\(W\\) are not resolvable. Thus,\ncontrary to your view, there are some genuine moral dilemmas.\u201d\nBy the same token, opponents of dilemmas may draw a distinction\nbetween dilemmas of type \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). And their message to\nsupporters of dilemmas is this: \u201cYou think that there are\ngenuine moral dilemmas, and given certain facts, it is understandable\nwhy this appears to be the case. But if you draw a distinction between\nconflicts of types \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), you can see that appearances can\nbe explained by the existence of type \\(X\\) alone, and type \\(X\\)\nconflicts are not genuine dilemmas.\u201d With this in mind, let us\nnote a few of the distinctions.\n\nOne distinction is between epistemic conflicts and\nontological conflicts. (For different terminology, see\nBlackburn 1996, 127\u2013128.) The former involve conflicts between\ntwo (or more) moral requirements and the agent does not know which of\nthe conflicting requirements takes precedence in her situation.\nEveryone concedes that there can be situations where one requirement\ndoes take priority over the other with which it conflicts, though at\nthe time action is called for it is difficult for the agent to tell\nwhich requirement prevails. The latter are conflicts between two (or\nmore) moral requirements, and neither is overridden. This is not\nsimply because the agent does not know which requirement is\nstronger; neither is. Genuine moral dilemmas, if there are any, are\nontological. Both opponents and supporters of dilemmas acknowledge\nthat there are epistemic conflicts.\n\nThere can be genuine moral dilemmas only if neither of the conflicting\nrequirements is overridden. Ross (1930, Chapter 2) held that all moral\nprecepts can be overridden in particular circumstances. This provides\nan inviting framework for opponents of dilemmas to adopt. But if some\nmoral requirements cannot be overridden\u2014if they hold\nabsolutely\u2014then it will be easier for supporters of dilemmas to\nmake their case. Lisa Tessman has distinguished between negotiable and\nnon-negotiable moral requirements (Tessman 2015, especially Chapters 1\nand 3). The former, if not satisfied, can be adequately compensated or\ncounterbalanced by some other good. Non-negotiable moral requirements,\nhowever, if violated produce a cost that no one should have to bear;\nsuch a violation cannot be counterbalanced by any benefits. If\nnon-negotiable moral requirements can conflict\u2014and Tessman\nargues that they can\u2014then those situations will be genuine\ndilemmas and agents facing them will inevitably fail morally. It might\nseem that if there is more than one moral precept that holds\nabsolutely, then moral dilemmas must be possible. Alan Donagan,\nhowever, argues against this. He maintains that moral rules hold\nabsolutely, and apparent exceptions are accounted for because tacit\nconditions are built in to each moral rule (Donagan 1977, Chapters 3\nand 6, especially 92\u201393). So even if some moral requirements\ncannot be overridden, the existence of dilemmas may still be an open\nquestion.\n\nAnother distinction is between self-imposed moral dilemmas\nand dilemmas imposed on an agent by the world, as it were.\nConflicts of the former sort arise because of the agent\u2019s own\nwrongdoing (Aquinas; Donagan 1977, 1984; and McConnell 1978). If an\nagent made two promises that he knew conflicted, then through his own\nactions he created a situation in which it is not possible for him to\ndischarge both of his requirements. Dilemmas imposed on the agent by\nthe world (or other agents), by contrast, do not arise because of the\nagent\u2019s wrongdoing. The case of Sartre\u2019s student is an\nexample, as is the case from Sophie\u2019s Choice. For\nsupporters of dilemmas, this distinction is not all that important.\nBut among opponents of dilemmas, there is a disagreement about whether\nthe distinction is important. Some of these opponents hold that\nself-imposed dilemmas are possible, but that their existence does not\npoint to any deep flaws in moral theory (Donagan 1977, Chapter 5).\nMoral theory tells agents how they ought to behave; but if agents\nviolate moral norms, of course things can go askew. Other opponents\ndeny that even self-imposed dilemmas are possible. They argue that an\nadequate moral theory should tell agents what they ought to do in\ntheir current circumstances, regardless of how those circumstances\narose. As Hill puts it, \u201c[M]orality acknowledges that human\nbeings are imperfect and often guilty, but it calls upon each at every\nnew moment of moral deliberation to decide conscientiously and to act\nrightly from that point on\u201d (Hill 1996, 176). Given the\nprevalence of wrongdoing, if a moral theory did not issue uniquely\naction-guiding \u201ccontrary-to-duty imperatives,\u201d its\npractical import would be limited. \n\nYet another distinction is between obligation dilemmas and\nprohibition dilemmas. The former are situations in which more\nthan one feasible action is obligatory. The latter involve cases in\nwhich all feasible actions are forbidden. Some (especially, Valentyne\n1987 and 1989) argue that plausible principles of deontic logic may\nwell render obligation dilemmas impossible; but they do not preclude\nthe possibility of prohibition dilemmas. The case of Sartre\u2019s\nstudent, if genuinely dilemmatic, is an obligation dilemma;\nSophie\u2019s case is a prohibition dilemma. There is another reason\nthat friends of dilemmas emphasize this distinction. Some think that\nthe \u201cdisjunctive solution\u201d used by opponents of\ndilemmas\u2014when equally strong precepts conflict, the agent is\nrequired to act on one or the other\u2014is more plausible when\napplied to obligation dilemmas than when applied to prohibition\ndilemmas.\n\nAs moral dilemmas are typically described, they involve a single\nagent. The agent ought, all things considered, to do \\(A\\),\nought, all things considered, to do \\(B\\), and she cannot do both\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\). But we can distinguish multi-person dilemmas\nfrom single agent ones. The two-person case is representative of\nmulti-person dilemmas. The situation is such that one agent, P1, ought\nto do \\(A\\), a second agent, P2, ought to do \\(B\\), and though each\nagent can do what he ought to do, it is not possible both for P1 to do\n\\(A\\) and P2 to do \\(B\\). (See Marcus 1980, 122 and McConnell 1988.)\nMulti-person dilemmas have been called \u201cinterpersonal moral\nconflicts.\u201d Such conflicts are most theoretically worrisome if\nthe same moral system (or theory) generates the conflicting\nobligations for P1 and P2. A theory that precludes single-agent moral\ndilemmas remains uniquely action-guiding for each agent. But if that\nsame theory does not preclude the possibility of interpersonal moral\nconflicts, not all agents will be able to succeed in discharging their\nobligations, no matter how well-motivated or how hard they try. For\nsupporters of moral dilemmas, this distinction is not all that\nimportant. They no doubt welcome (theoretically) more types of\ndilemmas, since that may make their case more persuasive. But if they\nestablish the reality of single-agent dilemmas, in one sense their\nwork is done. For opponents of dilemmas, however, the distinction may\nbe important. This is because at least some opponents believe that the\nconceptual argument against dilemmas applies principally to\nsingle-agent cases. It does so because the ought-to-do operator of\ndeontic logic and the accompanying principles are properly understood\nto apply to entities who can make decisions. To be clear, this\nposition does not preclude that collectives (such as businesses or\nnations) can have obligations. But a necessary condition for this\nbeing the case is that there is (or should be) a central deliberative\nstandpoint from which decisions are made. This condition is not\nsatisfied when two otherwise unrelated agents happen to have\nobligations both of which cannot be discharged. Put simply, while an\nindividual act involving one agent can be the object of choice, a\ncompound act involving multiple agents is difficult so to conceive.\n(See Smith 1986 and Thomason 1981.) Alexander Dietz (2022) has\nrecently shown, however, that matters can be even more complicated. He\ndescribes a case where a small group of people have an obligation to\nsave two strangers, but one of the members of the group has an\nobligation to save her own child at the same time. The small group and\nthe individual can both make choices, and the group\u2019s obligation\nconflicts with that of the individual member (assuming that the group\ncan succeed only if all members act in concert). This is an odd\nmulti-agent dilemma, \u201cone in which one of the agents is part of\nthe other\u201d (Dietz 2022, p. 66). Erin Taylor (2011) has argued\nthat neither universalizability nor the principle that\n\u2018ought\u2019 implies \u2018can\u2019 ensure that there will\nbe no interpersonal moral conflicts (what she calls\n\u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d). These conflicts would raise\nno difficulties if morality required trying rather than acting, but\nsuch a view is not plausible. Still, moral theories should minimize\ncases of interpersonal conflict (Taylor 2011, pp. 189\u2013190).To\nthe extent that the possibility of interpersonal moral conflicts\nraises an intramural dispute among opponents of dilemmas, that dispute\nconcerns how to understand the principles of deontic logic and what\ncan reasonably be demanded of moral theories.\n8. Multiple Moralities\n\nAnother issue raised by the topic of moral dilemmas is the\nrelationship among various aspects of morality. Consider this\ndistinction. General obligations are moral requirements that\nindividuals have simply because they are moral agents. That agents are\nrequired not to kill, not to steal, and not to assault are examples of\ngeneral obligations. Agency alone makes these precepts applicable to\nindividuals. By contrast, role-related obligations are moral\nrequirements that agents have in virtue of their role, occupation, or\nposition in society. That lifeguards are required to save swimmers in\ndistress is a role-related obligation. Another example, mentioned\nearlier, is the obligation of a defense attorney to hold in confidence\nthe disclosures made by a client. These categories need not be\nexclusive. It is likely that anyone who is in a position to do so\nought to save a drowning person. And if a person has particularly\nsensitive information about another, she should probably not reveal it\nto third parties regardless of how the information was obtained. But\nlifeguards have obligations to help swimmers in distress when most\nothers do not because of their abilities and contractual commitments.\nAnd lawyers have special obligations of confidentiality to their\nclients because of implicit promises and the need to maintain\ntrust.\n\nGeneral obligations and role-related obligations can, and sometimes\ndo, conflict. If a defense attorney knows the whereabouts of a\ndeceased body, she may have a general obligation to reveal this\ninformation to family members of the deceased. But if she obtained\nthis information from her client, the role-related obligation of\nconfidentiality prohibits her from sharing it with others. Supporters\nof dilemmas may regard conflicts of this sort as just another\nconfirmation of their thesis. Opponents of dilemmas will have to hold\nthat one of the conflicting obligations takes priority. The latter\ntask could be discharged if it were shown that one these two types of\nobligations always prevails over the other. But such a claim is\nimplausible; for it seems that in some cases of conflict general\nobligations are stronger, while in other cases role-related duties\ntake priority. The case seems to be made even better for supporters of\ndilemmas, and worse for opponents, when we consider that the same\nagent can occupy multiple roles that create conflicting requirements.\nThe physician, Harvey Kelekian, in Margaret Edson\u2019s (1999/1993)\nPulitzer Prize winning play, Wit, is an oncologist, a medical\nresearcher, and a teacher of residents. The obligations generated by\nthose roles lead Dr. Kelekian to treat his patient, Vivian Bearing, in\nways that seem morally questionable (McConnell 2009). At first blush,\nanyway, it does not seem possible for Kelekian to discharge all of the\nobligations associated with these various roles.\n\nIn the context of issues raised by the possibility of moral dilemmas,\nthe role most frequently discussed is that of the political actor.\nMichael Walzer (1973) claims that the political ruler, qua political\nruler, ought to do what is best for the state; that is his principal\nrole-related obligation. But he also ought to abide by the general\nobligations incumbent on all. Sometimes the political actor\u2019s\nrole-related obligations require him to do evil\u2014that is, to\nviolate some general obligations. Among the examples given by Walzer\nare making a deal with a dishonest ward boss (necessary to get elected\nso that he can do good) and authorizing the torture of a person in\norder to uncover a plot to bomb a public building. Since each of these\nrequirements is binding, Walzer believes that the politician faces a\ngenuine moral dilemma, though, strangely, he also thinks that the\npolitician should choose the good of the community rather than abide\nby the general moral norms. (The issue here is whether supporters of\ndilemmas can meaningfully talk about action-guidance in genuinely\ndilemmatic situations. For one who answers this in the affirmative,\nsee Tessman 2015, especially Chapter 5.) Such a situation is sometimes\ncalled \u201cthe dirty hands problem.\u201d The expression,\n\u201cdirty hands,\u201d is taken from the title of a play by Sartre\n(1946). The idea is that no one can rule without becoming morally\ntainted. The role itself is fraught with moral dilemmas. This topic\nhas received much attention recently. John Parrish (2007) has provided\na detailed history of how philosophers from Plato to Adam Smith have\ndealt with the issue. And C.A.J. Coady (2008) has suggested that this\nreveals a \u201cmessy morality.\u201d\n\nFor opponents of moral dilemmas, the problem of dirty hands represents\nboth a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to show how\nconflicts between general obligations and role-related obligations,\nand those among the various role-related obligations, can be resolved\nin a principled way. The opportunity for theories that purport to have\nthe resources to eliminate dilemmas\u2014such as Kantianism,\nutilitarianism, and intuitionism\u2014is to show how the many\nmoralities under which people are governed are related.\n9. Conclusion\n\nDebates about moral dilemmas have been extensive during the last six\ndecades. These debates go to the heart of moral theory. Both\nsupporters and opponents of moral dilemmas have major burdens to bear.\nOpponents of dilemmas must show why appearances are deceiving. Why are\nexamples of apparent dilemmas misleading? Why are certain moral\nemotions appropriate if the agent has done no wrong? Supporters must\nshow why several of many apparently plausible principles should be\ngiven up\u2014principles such as PC, PD, OP, D, \u2018ought\u2019\nimplies \u2018can\u2019, and the agglomeration principle. And each\nside must provide a general account of obligations, explaining whether\nnone, some, or all can be overridden in particular circumstances. Much\nprogress has been made, but the debate is apt to continue.\n",
