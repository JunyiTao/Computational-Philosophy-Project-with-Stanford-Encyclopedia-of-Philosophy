    "main_text": "Interpreting the Consolation\n7. Interpreting the Consolation\n\nOne, perfectly plausible, way of reading the Consolation is\nto take it, as most philosophical works are taken, at face value. On\nthis reading, Philosophy is recognized as a clearly authoritative\nfigure, whose teaching should not be doubted and whose success in\nconsoling the character Boethius must be assumed to be complete. The\napparent changes of direction noted in\n Section 5\n will be taken either as stages in Boethius\u2019s re-education or as\nunintended effects of the author\u2019s wish to make this work into a\ncompendium of a syncretistic philosophical system, and\nPhilosophy\u2019s own view that she has resolved the problem of\nprescience will be accepted as that of Boethius the author.\n\nYet there are a number of reasons which suggest that Boethius\u2019s\nintention as an author was more complex. First, it would have been\nhard for his intended audience of educated Christians to ignore the\nfact that in this dialogue a Christian, Boethius, is being instructed\nby a figure who clearly represents the tradition of pagan Philosophy,\nand who proposes some positions (on the World Soul in III m.9, and on\nthe sempiternity of the world in V.6) which most Christians would have\nfound dubious. Boethius the character says nothing which is explicitly\nChristian, but when in III.12 Philosophy says, echoing the words of\nWisdom viii, 1 that \u2018it is the highest good that rules all\nthings strongly and disposes them sweetly\u2019, he expresses his\ndelight not just in what she has said but much more \u2018in those\nvery words\u2019 that she uses\u2014a broad hint to the reader that\nhe remembers his Christian identity even in the midst of his\nphilosophical instruction.\n\nSecond, the genre Boethius chose for the Consolation, that of\nthe prosimetrum or Menippean satire, was associated with works which\nridicule the pretensions of authoritative claims to wisdom. Elements\nof satire on the claims of learning are present even in the vast,\nencyclopaedic Marriage of Mercury and Philology by the\nfifth-century author Martianus Capella, which Boethius clearly knew.\nAncient authors thought carefully about genres, and it is hard to\nthink that Boethius\u2019s choice was not a hint that\nPhilosophy\u2019s authority is not to be taken as complete. And,\nthird, in the light of these two considerations, the changes of\ndirection, incoherencies and ultimate failure of the long argument\nabout prescience, when the question is suddenly recast as one about\npredestination, all suggest themselves as intentional features, for\nwhich the interpreter must account.\n\nSome recent interpreters, such as Joel Relihan (1993, 187\u2013194;\n2007), have gone so far as to suggest that the Consolation\nshould be understood ironically as an account of the insufficiency of\nPhilosophy (and philosophy) to provide consolation, by contrast with\nChristian faith. Such a view seems too extreme, because Boethius the\nauthor has clearly taken great pains with the philosophical arguments\nproposed in the text, and the main lines of Philosophy\u2019s\nthinking fit well with the metaphysics glimpsed in the theological\ntractates and even, at moments, in the logical commentaries. It is\nplausible, however, to hold that Boethius wished, whilst acknowledging\nthe value of philosophy\u2014to which he had devoted his life, and\nfor which he presented himself as being about to die\u2014to point\nits limitations: limitations which Philosophy herself, who is keen to\nemphasize that she is not divine, accepts. Philosophy, he might be\nsuggesting, provides arguments and solutions to problems which should\nbe accepted and it teaches a way of living that should be followed,\nbut it falls short of providing a coherent and comprehensive\nunderstanding of God and his relation to creatures. Boethius the\ncharacter should be satisfied, but not completely satisfied, by\nPhilosophy\u2019s argument. And if this is Boethius the\nauthor\u2019s position in the Consolation, then it fits\nclosely with the theological method he pioneered in the opuscula\nsacra.\n",
