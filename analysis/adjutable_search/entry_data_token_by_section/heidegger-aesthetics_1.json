Heidegger\u2019s own understanding of the work of art is\nresolutely populist but with revolutionary aspirations. He\nbelieves that, at its greatest, art \u201cgrounds history\u201d by\n\u201callowing truth to spring forth\u201d (PLT 77/GA5\n 65).[4]\nBuilding on\nHeraclitus\u2019s view of the pervasive tension of normative\nconceptual oppositions (good/bad, worthy/worthless, noble/base, and the\nlike) that undergird and implicitly structure our sense of ourselves\nand our worlds, Heidegger imagines the way\n an ancient Greek temple at Paestum\n once worked to help unify its historical world by tacitly\n reinforcing a particular sense of what is and what matters:\n\n\nIt is the temple-work that first joins together and simultaneously\ngathers around itself the unity of those paths and relations in which\nbirth and death, disaster and blessing, victory and disgrace, endurance\nand decline obtain the form of destiny for human being. \u2026The\ntemple first gives to things their look and to humanity their outlook\non themselves. (PLT 42\u20133/GA5 27\u20139)\n\n\nGreat art works work in the background of our historical\nworlds, in other words, by partially embodying and so selectively\nreinforcing an historical community\u2019s implicit sense of what is\nand what matters. In this way, great artworks both (1)\n\u201cfirst give to things their look,\u201d that is, they help\nestablish an historical community\u2019s implicit sense of what things\nare, and they give (2) \u201cto humanity their outlook on\nthemselves,\u201d that is, they also help shape an historical\ncommunity\u2019s implicit sense of what truly matters in life\n(and so also what does not), which kinds of lives are most worth living, which\nactions are \u201cnoble\u201d (or \u201cbase\u201d), what in the\ncommunity\u2019s traditions most deserves to be preserved, and so\non.\n\n\nAs this suggests, Heidegger subscribes to a doctrine of\nontological historicity (refining a view first developed by\nHegel). Put simply, Heidegger thinks that humanity\u2019s\nfundamental experience of reality changes over time (sometimes\ndramatically), and he suggests that the work of art helps\nexplain the basic mechanism of this historical transformation\nof\n intelligibility.[5]\nBecause great art works\ninconspicuously to establish, maintain, and transform humanity\u2019s\nhistorically-variable sense of what is and what matters, Heidegger\nemphasizes that \u201cart is the becoming and happening of\ntruth\u201d (PLT 71/GA5 59). Put simply, great artworks\nhelp establish the implicit ontology and ethics through which an\nhistorical community understands itself and its\n world.[6]\nIn keeping with this\n(initially strange) doctrine of ontological historicity, Heidegger\nunderstands \u201ctruth\u201d ontologically as the\nhistorically-dynamic disclosure of intelligibility in time. As we\nwill see in section 3, this historical unfolding of truth takes\nplace\u2014to use Heidegger\u2019s preferred philosophical terms of\nart\u2014as an \u201ca-l\u00eatheiac\u201d struggle to\n\u201cdis-close\u201d or \u201cun-conceal\u201d\n(a-l\u00eatheia) that which conceals (l\u00eathe)\nitself, an \u201cessential strife\u201d between two interconnected\ndimensions of intelligibility (revealing and concealing) which\nHeidegger calls \u201cworld\u201d and \u201cearth\u201d in his most\nfamous work on art.\n\n\nIn sum, great art works by selectively focusing an\nhistorical community\u2019s tacit sense of what is and what matters\nand reflecting it back to that community, which thereby comes\nimplicitly to understand itself in the light of this artwork.\nArtworks thus function as ontological paradigms, serving their\ncommunities both as \u201cmodels of\u201d and \u201cmodels\nfor\u201d reality, which means (as Dreyfus nicely puts it) that\nartworks can variously \u201cmanifest,\u201d\n\u201carticulate,\u201d or even \u201creconfigure\u201d the\nhistorical ontologies undergirding their cultural\n worlds.[7]\nHeidegger\nsuggests, in other words, that art can accomplish its world-disclosing\nwork on at least three different orders of magnitude: (1)\nmicro-paradigms he will later calls \u201cthings thinging,\u201d\nwhich help us become aware of what matters most deeply to us; (2)\nparadigmatic artworks like Van Gogh\u2019s painting and\nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s poetry, which disclose how art itself works; and\n(3) macro-paradigmatic \u201cgreat\u201d works of art like the Greek\ntemple and tragic drama (works Heidegger also sometimes calls\n\u201cgods\u201d), which succeed in fundamentally transforming an\nhistorical community\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of being,\u201d its\nmost basic and ultimate understanding of what is and what\n matters.[8]\n\n\nIt is with this ontologically revolutionary potential of great art\nin mind that Heidegger writes:\n\n\nWhenever [great] art happens\u2014that is, when there is a\nbeginning\u2014a push enters history, and history either starts up or\nstarts again. (PLT 77/GA5 65)\n\n\nThat is, great art is capable of overcoming the inertia of existing\ntraditions and moving the interconnected ontological and ethical wheels\nof history, either giving us a new sense of what is and what matters or\nelse fundamentally transforming the established ontology and ethics\nthrough which we make sense of the world and\n ourselves.[9]\nGiven Heidegger\u2019s\nview of the literally revolutionary role art can thus play in\ninconspicuously shaping and transforming our basic sense of what is and\nwhat matters, his occasionally ill-tempered critiques of the reduction\nof art to aesthetics become much easier to understand. For, in\nhis view, the stakes of our understanding of and approach to art could\nnot be higher.\n",
