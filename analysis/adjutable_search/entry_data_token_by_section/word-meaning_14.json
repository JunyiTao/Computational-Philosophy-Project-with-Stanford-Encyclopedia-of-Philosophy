    "main_text": "Linguistics || Generativist Semantics\n4.2 Generativist Semantics\n\nThe componential current of structuralism was the first to produce an\nimportant innovation in theories of word meaning: Katzian semantics\n(Katz & Fodor 1963; Katz 1972, 1987). Katzian semantics combined\ncomponential analysis with a mentalistic conception of word meaning\nand developed a method for the description of lexical phenomena in the\ncontext of a formal grammar. The mentalistic component of Katzian\nsemantics is twofold. First, word meanings are defined as aggregates\nof simpler conceptual features inherited from our general\ncategorization abilities. Second, the proper subject matter of the\ntheory is no longer identified with the \u201cstructure of the\nlanguage\u201d but, following Chomsky (1957, 1965), with speakers\u2019\nability to competently interpret the words and sentences of their\nlanguage. In Katzian semantics, word meanings are structured entities\nwhose representations are called semantic markers. A semantic\nmarker is a hierarchical tree with labeled nodes whose structure\nreproduces the structure of the represented meaning, and whose labels\nidentify the word\u2019s conceptual components. For example, the\nfigure below illustrates the sense of \u2018chase\u2019 (simplified\nfrom Katz 1987).\n\n\n\n\nKatz (1987) claimed that this approach was superior in both\ntransparency and richness to the analysis of word meaning that could\nbe provided via meaning postulates. For example, in Katzian semantics\nthe validation of conditionals such as \\(\\forall x\\forall y\n(\\textrm{chase}(x, y) \\to \\textrm{follow}(x,y))\\) could be reduced to\na matter of inspection: one had simply to check whether the semantic\nmarker of \u2018follow\u2019 was a subtree of the semantic marker of\n\u2018chase\u2019. Furthermore, the method incorporated syntagmatic\nrelations in the representation of word meanings (witness the\ngrammatical tags \u2018NP\u2019, \u2018VP\u2019 and\n\u2018S\u2019 attached to the conceptual components above). Katzian\nsemantics was favorably received by the Generative Semantics movement\n(Fodor 1977; Newmeyer 1980) and boosted an interest in the formal\nrepresentation of word meaning that would dominate the linguistic\nscene for decades to come (Harris 1993). Nonetheless, it was\neventually abandoned. As subsequent commentators noted, Katzian\nsemantics suffered from three important drawbacks. First, the theory\ndid not provide any clear model of how the complex conceptual\ninformation represented by semantic markers contributed to the truth\nconditions of sentences (Lewis 1972). Second, some aspects of word\nmeaning that could be easily represented with meaning postulates could\nnot be expressed through semantic markers, such as the symmetry and\nthe transitivity of predicates\n\n\n\n(e.g., \\(\\forall x\\forall y (\\textrm{sibling}(x, y) \\to\n\\textrm{sibling}(y, x))\\) or \\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z\n(\\textrm{louder}(x, y) \\mathbin{\\&} \\textrm{louder}(y, z) \\to\n\\textrm{louder}(x, z))\\); see Dowty 1979).\n\n\nThird, Katz\u2019s arguments for the view that word meanings are\nintrinsically structured turned out to be vulnerable to objections\nfrom proponents of atomistic views of word meaning (see, most notably,\nFodor & Lepore 1992).\n\nAfter Katzian semantics, the landscape of linguistic theories of word\nmeaning bifurcated. On one side, we find a group of theories advancing\nthe decompositional agenda established by Katz. On the other\nside, we find a group of theories fostering the relational\napproach originated by Lexical Field Theory and relational semantics.\nFollowing Geeraerts (2010), we will briefly characterize the following\nones.\n\n\nDecompositional Frameworks\nRelational Frameworks\n\nNatural Semantic Metalanguage\n Symbolic Networks\n\nConceptual Semantics\n Statistical Analysis\n\nTwo-Level Semantics\n\n\nGenerative Lexicon Theory\n\n\n",
