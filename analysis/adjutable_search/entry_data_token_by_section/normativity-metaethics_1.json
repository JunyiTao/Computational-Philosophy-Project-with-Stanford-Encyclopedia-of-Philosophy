    "main_text": "The Target Explanandum || Concept vs. World\n1.1 Concept vs. World\n\nIf we wanted to gain an understanding of physicality,\nwe\u2019d need to first settle whether it was most important to\nunderstand physical concepts, physical properties,\nphysical facts, or something else entirely. Similarly, one\ninitial issue worth settling here is whether we should be\ninvestigating normative concepts, normative properties, normative\nfacts, or all of these, or, perhaps, something else entirely.\n\nThis debate could happen at a general level \u2013 whether it is more\nimportant to understand things in general at a conceptual or a\n\u201cworldly\u201d level. (Here, and in what follows, we use\n\u201cworldly\u201d to refer to metaphysical matters \u2013 matters\nthat are in the realm of what our thoughts and concepts are\nabout.) But it might be that there are special considerations\nregarding the normative domain that point us in one direction or\nthe other. Consider an illustrative case: the debate around G.E.\nMoore\u2019s famous \u201cOpen Question Argument\u201d early in the\ntwentieth century, at least on one interpretation of the argument (see\nentry on\n moral non-naturalism, section on the open question argument).\n Moore argued, in Principia Ethica, that for any proposed\nanalysis of moral concept <M> in terms of natural\nconcept <N>, someone who fully grasped and understood\nthe relevant concepts could still grant that something is N\nbut wonder whether it is M. (For example, a speaker competent\nwith the concepts involved could sincerely wonder: \u201cIt\u2019s\npainful, but is it bad?\u201d) But such questions would not be\n\u201copen\u201d to competent speakers if M could be\nanalyzed in terms of N. So, there can be no analysis\nof any moral concept in purely natural terms (Moore 1903 [1993: ch.\n1]).\n\nIf successful, this argument tells us something useful about\nmoral \u2013 and also, by similar reasoning, normative \u2013 concepts:\nthat they cannot be reduced to natural ones. But it does not\nautomatically tell us anything about moral metaphysics. It is\nentirely possible that while the concept <bad>\ncannot be reduced to the concept <painful>, the\nproperty of badness (if there is such a property) can be\nreduced to the property of painfulness. Roughly speaking,\nthere can be conceptual gaps even where there are no metaphysical\ngaps: water might be distinct from H2O at the conceptual\nlevel even if water is metaphysically identical to H2O.\nSome metaethical naturalists have argued for an analogous claim in the\nethical domain (see Boyd 1988).\n\nWhat this case shows is that insights about normative concepts often\ndon\u2019t carry over to normative metaphysics, and vice versa. This\nwill be true about some of the questions we consider here. For\nexample, take the question of the relationship between the normative\nand the non-normative. The case of the Open Question Argument directly\nillustrates that what we say about the relationship between normative\nand non-normative facts may be different from what we\nsay about the relationship between normative and non-normative\nconcepts. Similarly, when we come to discuss whether the\nnormative obtains independently of what anyone thinks or\nfeels \u2013 the question of mind-independence \u2013 the\nconceptual/metaphysical distinction makes a big difference. Most\ncontemporary mind-dependence theorists don\u2019t want to\nsay that normative concepts are explained by mental concepts, in the\nsame way that (on their views) normative facts are explained by mental\nfacts.\n\nIt would be difficult to deny that there are normative concepts. We\nhave normative thoughts, such as that so-and-so was an evil person or\nthat such-and-such was the wrong thing to do. There are common\nthoughts such as that it would be a bad idea to have yet another Dr\nPepper. And our having such thoughts reveals that we have the\nnormative concepts involved in them, such as the concepts\n<evil>, <wrong> and <bad>. But some\nphilosophers deny that there are normative properties that are\nreferred to or represented by our normative concepts, and that there\nare normative facts that are referred to or represented by our\nnormative thoughts. Accounts of these kinds are anti-realist in that\nthey hold that normativity lies in the realm of thought rather than in\nthe worldly realm of metaphysics. A further complication is that\nanti-realist accounts of these kinds can be\nnihilistic \u2013 taking it that, to a first approximation,\nthere are no normative truths \u2013 or cognitivist and\nconcessive \u2013 taking it that, again approximately, there are\nnormative truths but they have no metaphysical commitments \u2013 or\nnon-cognitivist \u2013 taking it that, roughly, our normative\n\u201cthoughts\u201d are not strictly speaking representational in\nthe way that (other) beliefs are and that there are normative truths,\nbut only in a deflationary sense.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to take a hard stand here on whether conceptual or\nworldly questions are more important: the truth is probably that both\nkinds of question are important at various junctures. However, if\nwe are right that virtually every party to debates about normativity\nwould agree that there are normative concepts, the main area of debate\nis going to be in metaphysics, about whether or not there are worldly\nnormative properties and facts. We think that philosophers\u2019\ndifferent views about the metaphysical issues will go a long way\ntoward explaining their different views about other matters, such as\nthe nature of normative thoughts, the nature of moral motivation, and\nso on. We will therefore begin with issues about normative facts and\nproperties.\n\nIn thinking about these issues, we will adopt a familiar\n\u201crobust\u201d or \u201crealist\u201d view about the nature of\nproperties, concepts, truths, propositions, and facts. We take it that\nproperties are worldly characteristics of things that explain\nobjective worldly similarities among things. So, for example, the\nproperty redness is the characteristic shared by things that\nare similar in being red. We also assume that we have\nconcepts of properties, which are our way of representing\nproperties in thought, and we assume there are propositions, which are\nthe objects of belief, and which are structured entities at least\npartly constituted by concepts. We take beliefs to be cognitive\nstates, the objects of which are propositions, which can be evaluated\nas true or false. Further, we take it that, at least in the case of\nsynthetic truths, if a sentence or proposition is true, it is true in\nvirtue of the obtaining of a relevant fact or worldly state of\naffairs. We take it that facts are worldly states of affairs.\nA simple example is the instantiation of redness by a fire truck. Our\nconcern, then, is whether there are normative facts and\nproperties.\n\nIt will be useful to consider briefly why one might suppose there are\nany normative facts \u2013 where a normative fact would be, again, on\nour usage of the term \u201cfact\u201d, a worldly state of affairs\ninvolving the instantiation of a normative property, such as the fact\nthat torture is wrong. One reason to think that such entities exist\ncan be derived from reflection on our normative thought and talk. We\nthink, for instance, that torture is wrong just as we think that\ntorture is (unfortunately) widespread. We think these things are true,\nand, intuitively, for a sentence or proposition to be true is for it\nto be accurate to the facts. This gives us reason to think that our\nthoughts about torture commit us to the existence of the normative\nfact that torture is wrong just as they commit us to the existence of\nthe fact that torture is widespread. Moreover, our thought that\ntorture is wrong seems on its face to ascribe wrongness to torture,\njust as our thought that torture is widespread ascribes being\nwidespread to torture, so these thoughts seem to commit us to the\nexistence of the property wrongness, just as they commit us\nto the existence of the property being widespread. In short,\nit seems that our normative thoughts commit us to the existence of\nnormative facts and properties. As we will see, however, the idea that\nthere is this commitment would be denied by philosophers who accept\none or another form of normative anti-realism \u2013 non-cognitivists\nor expressivists, \u201cquietists\u201d, cognitive anti-realists,\nand at least some constructivists. And anti-realists of another kind,\nerror theorists, agree that our moral thought and talk commit\nus to the existence of normative facts and properties, but they think\nthis commitment is false. They think there are no such things. We will\ndiscuss these anti-realist positions in what follows.\n",
