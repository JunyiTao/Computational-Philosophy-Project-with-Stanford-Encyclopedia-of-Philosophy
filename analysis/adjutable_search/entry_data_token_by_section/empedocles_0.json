    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\nThe philosopher Empedocles was a native of the south-central Sicilian\npolis of Acragas (Agrigento). Although the precise dates of his\nlifetime are unknown, the sources agree that he was born in the early\nfifth century BCE; according to Aristotle, he died at sixty years of\nage (DK 31 A 1 = P 5b). Rich detail on the philosopher\u2019s life\nsurvives in particular through a late biography written in Diogenes\nLaertius\u2019 Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers,\nwhich dates to the third century CE. Unfortunately, much of this is a\nromantic confection, and is often derivative of the verses of\nEmpedocles himself. It is likely that he was born to an aristocratic\nfamily; his grandfather kept horses and was remembered as a victor at\nthe Olympic Games. According to the fourth-century BCE sophist\nAlcidamas\u2019 Physics (A 1 = P 15), Empedocles was a\nstudent of Parmenides of Elea, and later became an adherent of\nAnaxagoras and Pythagoras. This intellectual apprenticeship, while\nhardly possible on chronological grounds, does accurately reflect the\nverses\u2019 engagement with Parmenides\u2019 theories of coming to\nbe and passing away, and Empedocles\u2019 familiarity with the\nPythagoreans and Anaxagoras is not unlikely. The third-century BCE\nbiographer of eminent philosophers, Hermippus, by contrast, held that\nhe was an emulator of Xenophanes (A 1 = P 14). In Empedocles\u2019\nlifetime, Acragas underwent a series of political transformations from\ntyranny to oligarchy to democracy. The biographical tradition\npersistently attributes democratic sensibilities to Empedocles: he is\nsaid to have championed the people against those advancing inequality\nor aiming at tyranny (A1 = P 18\u201319). Further, he was associated\nwith dismantling an oligarchy of the \u201cThousand\u201d and\nrejecting an offer of kingship; similarly, his father apparently\nforestalled a rising tyranny (D.L. 8.72). These anecdotes may explain\nEmpedocles\u2019 reputation as a talented orator in the absence of\nany prose treatises. In Aristotle\u2019s Sophist, he is\ncredited with rhetoric\u2019s invention (A 1 = R 5). So too,\nAristotle\u2019s On the Poets praised his kinship with Homer\nin the force of his language and metaphor (A 1 = R 1b). Significantly,\nGorgias was associated with him as a student (A 1 = P 24). Elsewhere,\nEmpedocles is reported to have been a physician (A 1 = P 24) and a\nfounder of the Sicilian school of medicine. Evidence for this\nreputation is present already in the late fifth century in the\nHippocratic On Ancient Medicine, which critiques\nEmpedocles\u2019 alliance of the study of nature and medicine (A 71 =\nR 6). Most provocatively, he is said to have brought a dead woman back\nto life and been worshipped as a god in his own lifetime (A 1 = P 29),\nnarratives clearly embellished from his poetry (B 112.4 = D 4.4). Like\nhis contemporaries, Empedocles supposedly travelled widely, visiting\nThurii after its foundation in 445/4, Olympia, and elsewhere in the\nPeloponnese. His enemies may have taken such an absence as an\nopportunity to exile the philosopher (A 1 = D.L. 8.67). Reports on his\ndeath are confused. We can be sure that he did not make the fiery leap\ninto Aetna, as was widely held in antiquity (Chitwood 1986). It is\npossible, but that is all, that he died in the Peloponnese (A 1 = P\n29.71b\u201372).\n\nThough his work has not survived intact, Empedocles enjoyed a dynamic\nafterlife among philosophers and their commentators, as well as\nphysicians and natural scientists. According to Diogenes Laertius,\nEmpedocles composed two poems, On Nature and the\nPurifications. Various other works were attributed to the\nphilosopher in antiquity, including a hymn to Apollo, a poem on the\ninvasion of Xerxes, medical texts, tragedies, epigrams, and political\nessays, but there is no unambiguous evidence for these. The\ninterpretation of the extant fragments from On Nature and the\nPurifications is complicated by the modern scholarly debate\non whether they in fact constitute two works, as Diogenes Laertius\nalleged, or a single philosophical project, as some recent scholars\nhave argued (Osborne 1987, Inwood 2001, Tr\u00e9panier 2004, Janko\n2005). The latter, heterodox position has been fueled further by the\nrecent publication of the Strasbourg papyrus (Martin & Primavesi\n1999, Primavesi 2008), which contains a portion of On Nature\nwith lines that had traditionally been assigned to the\nPurifications. This find unsettles the notion of a physical\ndoctrine separate from a religious one, showing that if there are two\nworks, these were much more closely thematically related than was\npreviously understood. Nevertheless, as the topics of the two parts\n(if they did belong to a single poem) are sufficiently distinct, we\ntreat them separately here. The first primarily concerns the\nformation, structure, and history of the physical world as a whole,\nand the formation of the animals and plants within it; the second\nconcerns morality and purification. For convenience, this article uses\nthe traditional names for the two collections of fragments. \n",
