    "main_text": "The Letter of the Law and The Spirit of the Law\n14. The Letter of the Law and The Spirit of the Law\n\nBut the letter of the law is one thing, its spirit quite another. Even\nif speaker intention counts for something, for two reasons, it\ndoesn\u2019t count for much, at least in the great majority of cases.\nOne swallow is not a summer, and a single such intention or belief not\na convention or, except in very odd circumstances, sufficient for one.\nCases like those of Humpty Dumpty and the counterexample discussed\nabove show how slight the weight of a speaker\u2019s intention is in\nthe face of a convention that\u2019s already established (the case of\nHumpty Dumpty) or even in the process of being established (the case\nof A and his community). And the situation we in fact find ourselves\nin is just that of Alice. The weight carried by pre-existing\nlinguistic conventions makes it look as if Humpty Dumpty\u2019s\nintention has no weight at all. If what was argued above is correct,\nit doesn\u2019t have no weight, but a microgram is, for practical\npurposes, weightless when counterbalanced by a boulder. Thus even if\nstrictly speaking, there\u2019s no intentional fallacy, it would be\nmuch more misleading in practice to say that there isn\u2019t one\nthan that there is one.\n\nThe case of Humpty Dumpty shouldn\u2019t be misunderstood, however.\nThe establishment or maintenance of a linguistic convention\nisn\u2019t simply a matter of majority opinion within a speaking\ncommunity. A convention is more than a collection of beliefs,\nunderstandings, and treatments. It carries normative force with it,\nand normative force, although undergirded by and impossible without\ncommunity support, doesn\u2019t simply sway in the direction that the\nbreeze of majority opinion happens to be blowing at the time. The\nnormative nature of a convention enables it to be relatively, though\nnot wholly, resistant to contrary opinion. That\u2019s why it\u2019s\npossible for most people to spell \u201caccommodate\u201d\nincorrectly (the conventions of spelling call for it to be spelled\nwith two \u2018m\u2019s, but most people spell it with one)\nand why it\u2019s possible for most people to have an incorrect\nbelief about the meaning of the word \u201cfortuitous\u201d (the\nconventions of the language call for it to mean by chance or\naccidental, but most people think it means\nlucky).\n\nThe second reason why the conclusion that, strictly speaking,\nthere\u2019s no intentional fallacy is of limited import is in effect\npointed out by Beardsley. The notion of speaker meaning\u2014a\nspeaker\u2019s intention that \u2018S\u2019 mean\nm in his utterance of \u2018S\u2019\u2014is\nparasitic on that of a convention, and thus on sentence meaning. In\nintending what he does, that is, in intending that his sentence mean\nm, and not n, o, or p, a speaker\nis perforce trying to conform to what he takes to be a pre-existing\nconvention. If he doesn\u2019t take there to be such a convention, he\nneeds to stipulate one\u2014which itself involves invoking\npre-existing conventions. If he doesn\u2019t do that and\ndoesn\u2019t try to conform to a pre-existing convention,\nthere\u2019s no reason to think that he\u2019s trying to\ncommunicate, to utter a sentence with a determinate meaning, or to\nperform any speech act at all. In other words, without the assumption\nof a pre-existing convention, there\u2019s no content to the notion\nof an intention to mean anything at all, much less to mean m.\nEven if a speaker\u2019s intention is criterial in determining\nconventions and sentence meaning, conventions have to be\nconceptualized as relatively independent of the speaker, as logically\nprior to speaker meaning, and as a constraint on speaker meaning.\n\nThe upshot is that, to put a fine point on it, there\u2019s no\nintentional fallacy, but that a fine point shouldn\u2019t be put on\nit. As far as everyday discourse is concerned, proper interpretive\npractice directs us to ignore speakers\u2019 intentions. For\nconsidered in and of itself, in the context of a living, fully\ndeveloped language, a speaker\u2019s intention has vanishingly small\nweight, noticeable at all, if ever, only in a very small number of\ncircumstances. An additional merit of this view is that it helps to\nexplain the facts that (1) in the vast majority of cases, questions of\nspeaker intention needn\u2019t and don\u2019t arise in interpreting\na person\u2019s remarks; (2) hard cases are\npossible\u2014conventions are of necessity open-ended, somewhat\nindefinite, and possibly in tension with other conventions; (3)\nit\u2019s natural, and not entirely unreasonable, to evoke speaker\nintention\u00a0to resolve such hard cases; (4) the gnawing feeling\nthat the meaning of an utterance isn\u2019t altogether divorced from\nthe meaning intention of its speaker has some basis; (5) despite (3),\nproponents of the intentional fallacy can always find ways of\nresolving hard cases without invoking the intentions of the\nspeaker.\n",
