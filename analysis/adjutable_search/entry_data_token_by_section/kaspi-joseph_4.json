Philosophical principles in lexicographic methodology\n\nIn Kaspi\u2019s view, all Hebrew words are distinct; Hebrew has no\nabsolute synonyms or homonyms. In support of this view, he wrote a\nkind of dictionary of the roots of biblical Hebrew (Sharshot\nKesef. The dictionary is based on two main assumptions:\n\nThere are no real homonyms. Kaspi determines the principle of the\ncommon denominator a priori, an economic principle of logic according\nto which the root has a chief meaning that includes all words derived\nfrom the same root. In some cases, however, he was forced to adapt the\ndata to conform to the principle. Thus, for example, the root\nl-ch-m denotes \u201copposition and resistance,\u201d and\nfrom it are derived the Hebrew words for \u201cwar\u201d\n(milchamah) and \u201cbread\u201d (lechem). He\nexplains the use of this root for \u201cbread\u201d in light of\nAristotle\u2019s proposition in On the Soul 416 that\n\u201cFood is\u2026 the contrary of what is fed.\u201d Kaspi\nexpresses amazement that anyone should disagree with this principle:\n\u201cFor how could a person think that the creators of the language,\nwho were great scholars, could have used one noun\u2026 for things\nso unrelated\u201d (Sharshot Kesef, ed. Last, p. 29).\nThere are no absolute synonyms. Kaspi, who claims that Hebrew has\nno absolute synonyms for words, worked hard to differentiate among\nsynonyms throughout his dictionary.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, contemporary linguistics discerns two key types of\nmeaning differentiation: (a) between word designata, in which\neach synonym is designated differently:\nquantitatively\u2014rekhev vs. mekhonith (motor\nvehicle vs. automobile); qualitatively\u2014shikor vs.\nmevusam (inebriated vs. tipsy); (b) among registers or layers\nof language (layish vs. aryeh/lion).\n\nKaspi also insists on an additional type of differentiation among\nsynonyms, maintaining that there is but one designatum and even the\ndesignates do not differ. Differences among words are embodied in the\naspects of the designatum that they emphasize. For example, Kaspi\nexplains that the words h\u0323erev, sakkin, maakheleth and\nshelah\u0323 (javelin) are not synonymous because each\ndesignates a different aspect of the object. Kaspi maintains, that all\nthese objects are cutting instruments: knives. One is called\nh\u0323erev because it attests to the destruction\n(h\u0323urban) of those struck by it; a sakkin\ndesignates the stricken victim as subject to danger and then severed\nfrom living creatures (according to Kaspi\u2019s interpretation of\nthe root samekh-kaf-nun). The instructive word\nmaakhelet informs us that the stricken one is slaughtered,\nconsumed (neekhal), terminated and so on. The words\nh\u0323erev, sakkin, maakhelet, and shelah\u0323\nthus designate the same type of tool, a cutting instrument. Different\nwords indicate and describe different phenomena concerning the\ndesignatum, but these are not synonyms.\n\nAnother significant difference between dictionaries produced before\nand up to Kaspi\u2019s time and Sharshoth Kesef is the order\nof discussion of lexical forms. Ibn Janah\u0323 and Radaq, who\npreceded Kaspi, begin by presenting the forms of the verbs derived\nfrom a given Biblical root, followed by the noun forms. Unlike earlier\nlexicographers of Hebrew and Arabic, Kaspi composed a dictionary in\nwhich the nouns derived from the root were described first and the\nrelevant verb form system was only shown afterward. This change in\norder is by no means coincidental. In Retuqot Kesef, Section\n40, Kaspi analyzes the structure of the Hebrew language. First, its\nfounders agreed on the general meaning of each root. Then they coined\nan abstract name designating its meaning that is not connected to any\nparticular object or occurrence. Subsequently, they coined the\nverb\u2019s infinitive, thereby creating the reality to which the\nnoun refers. The infinitive is an abstract noun expressing an\noccurrence. Subsequently, they formed adjectives that are concretely\nconnected with specific objects. After completing the nouns, they\ninvented a system that addresses tangible activity and occurrences. In\nother words, Kaspi maintains that the formation of nouns and the\nvarious weights accorded to them proceed from the most abstract to the\nmost tangible. As the verb system is the most tangible of all, it was\ndevised last.\n",
