    "main_text": "Nonidentity Cases || The 14-year-old girl\n2.3 The 14-year-old girl\n\nAnother classic case from Parfit focuses on the simple fact that the\negg cell a young girl will produce soon after she becomes capable of\nconceiving a child will not be the same egg cell as the one she will\nproduce a decade or more later. \u201cThis girl chooses to have a\nchild\u201d (Parfit 1987, 358). We think that it would have been\nbetter for the girl to wait \u201cfor several years\u201d to have a\nchild and that, barring exceptional circumstances, what the girl has\nin fact done is wrong (Parfit 1987, 358). We also think that the\nreason her choice is wrong is that it causes the child the girl bears\nto be given a \u201cbad start in life\u201d (Parfit 1987, 358). On\ncloser inspection, however, we see that that particular child\ncould not have existed at all had the girl waited until she was older\nto have a child. Given that the child\u2019s life is worth living\n\u2013 given, that is, that it would not have been better for the\nchild that he or she never have existed at all \u2013 it seems that\nthe child has not been harmed, or made worse off, by what the girl has\ndone, and that there exists no plausible basis for the position that\nher act is \u201cbad for\u201d the child.\n\nSince Parfit first described the 14-year-old girl case, reproductive\ntechnologies have advanced. The option of cryopreserving gametes or\nnewly formed human embryos now means that there is at least a\ntheoretical possibility that the 14-year-old girl really could have\nproduced the same child \u2013 or at least a child from the same\ngametes \u2013 many years later. Even so, the probabilities of the\nsituation would need to be taken into account. Changing the manner of\nconception \u2013 moving, that is, from coitus to in vitro\nfertilization \u2013 would have surely meant that very\nprobably it would have been a nonidentical (if better off) child\nwho would have been conceived in place of the one. \n",
