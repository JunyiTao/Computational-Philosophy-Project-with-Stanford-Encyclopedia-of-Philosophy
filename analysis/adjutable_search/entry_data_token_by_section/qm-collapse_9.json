Collapse Theories and Definite Perceptions\n\nSome authors (Albert & Vaidman 1989; Albert 1990, 1992) have\nraised an interesting objection concerning the emergence of definite\nperceptions within Collapse Theories. The objection is based on the\nfact that one can easily imagine situations leading to definite\nperceptions, that nevertheless do not involve the displacement of a\nlarge number of particles up to the stage of the perception itself.\nThese cases would then constitute actual measurement situations which\ncannot be described by the GRW theory, contrary to what happens for\nthe idealized (according to the authors) situations considered in many\npresentations of it, i.e., those involving the displacement of some\nsort of pointer. To be more specific, the above papers consider a\n\u2018measurement-like\u2019 process whose output is the emission of\na burst of few photons triggered by the position in which a particle\nhits a screen. This can easily be devised by considering, e.g., a\nStern-Gerlach set-up in which a spin 1/2 microsystem, according to the\nvalue of its spin component, hits a fluorescent screen in different\nplaces and excites a small number of atoms which subsequently decay,\nemitting a small number of photons. \n\nThe argument goes as follows: if one triggers the apparatus with a\nsuperposition of two spin states, since only a few atoms are excited,\nsince the excitations involve displacements which are smaller than the\ncharacteristic localization distance of GRW, since GRW does not induce\nreductions on photon states and, finally, since the photon states\nimmediately overlap, there is no way for the spontaneous localization\nmechanism to become effective in suppressing the ensuing superposition\nof the states \u2018photons emerging from point \\(A\\) of the\nscreen\u2019 and \u2018photons emerging from point \\(B\\) of the\nscreen\u2019. On the other hand, since the visual perception\nthreshold is quite low (about 6\u20137 photons), there is no doubt\nthat the naked eye of a human observer is sufficient to detect whether\nthe luminous spot on the screen is at \\(A\\) or at \\(B\\). The\nconclusion follows: in the case under consideration no dynamical\nreduction can take place and as a consequence no measurement is over,\nno outcome is definite, up to the moment in which a conscious observer\nperceives the spot.\n\nAicardi et al. (1991) have presented a detailed answer to this\ncriticism: it is agreed that in the considered case the superposition\npersists for long times (actually the superposition must persist\nsince, being the system under consideration microscopic, one could\nperform interference experiments which everybody would expect to\nconfirm quantum mechanics). However, to deal in the appropriate and\ncorrect way with such a criticism, one has to consider all the systems\nwhich enter into play (electron, screen, photons and brain) and the\nuniversal dynamics governing all relevant physical processes. A simple\nestimate of the number of ions which are involved in the transmission\nof the nervous signal up to the higher virtual cortex makes perfectly\nplausible that, in the process, a sufficient number of particles are\ndisplaced by a sufficient spatial amount to satisfy the conditions\nunder which, according to the GRW theory, the suppression of the\nsuperposition of the two nervous signals will take place within the\ntime scale of the perception.\n\nThis analysis by no means amounts to attributing a special role to the\nconscious observer or to the perception process. The observer\u2019s\nbrain is the only system present in the set-up in which a\nsuperposition of two states involving different locations of a large\nnumber of particles occurs. As such it is the only place where the\nreduction can and actually must take place according to the theory. It\nis extremely important to stress that if in place of the eye of a\nhuman being one puts in front of the photons\u2019 beam a spark chamber or\na device leading to the displacement of a macroscopic pointer, or\nproducing ink spots on a computer output, reduction will equally take\nplace. In the given example, the human nervous system is simply a\nphysical system, a specific assembly of particles, which performs the\nsame function as any other device, if no other such device interacts\nwith the photons before the human observer does. It follows that it is\nincorrect and seriously misleading to claim that the GRW theory\nrequires a conscious observer in order for measurements to have a\ndefinite outcome.\n\nA further remark may be appropriate. The above analysis could be taken\nby the reader as indicating a very naive and oversimplified attitude\ntowards the deep problem of the mind-brain correspondence. There is no\nclaim and no presumption that GRW allows a physicalist explanation of\nconscious perception. It is only pointed out that, based on what we\nknow about the purely physical aspects of the process, one can state\nthat before the nervous pulses reach the higher visual cortex, the\nconditions guaranteeing the suppression of one of the two signals are\nverified. In brief, a consistent use of the dynamical reduction\nmechanism in the above situation accounts for the definiteness of the\nconscious perception, even in the extremely peculiar situation devised\nby Albert and Vaidman.\n",
