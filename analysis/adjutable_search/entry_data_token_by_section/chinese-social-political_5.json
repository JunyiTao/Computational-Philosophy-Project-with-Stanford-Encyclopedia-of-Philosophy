    "main_text": "The Classical Era || Dao De Jing: Nature and Non-Action (Wuwei)\n2.4 Dao De Jing: Nature and Non-Action (Wuwei)\n\nThe \u201cGuodian\u201d version of the Dao De Jing,\ndiscovered in a tomb in 1993, begins:\n\n\nCut off knowledge, abandon argumentation, and the people will benefit\na hundredfold. Cut off cleverness, abandon \u201cbenefit\u201d, and\nthere will be no more thieves or bandits. Cut off activity and abandon\npurposefulness, and the people will again be filial\u2026. Exhibit\nthe unadorned and embrace the simple. Have little thought of self and\nfew desires. (Henricks 2000: 28; cp. ch. 19 of received version\n[DDJ])\n\n\nIn several respects the attitude here expressed mirrors that of the\nMencius: explicit discussion of \u201cbenefit\u201d is\nrejected, though the indirect goal of benefitting the people is\nendorsed; argumentation\u2014whether referring to litigation or\nlogical disputation\u2014is rejected; a simple life with \u201cfew\ndesires\u201d (cp. MC 7B:35) is favored. On at least the first two\ncounts, Mohism seems the specific target (as it is in the\nMencius as well).\n\nDespite these resonances, though, there are also important differences\nbetween the Dao De Jing and Mencius. Most important\nare the differences in their respective positive accounts of what\nrulers should do. In the Mencius, rulers are enjoined to\nfollow the way of the ancient kings and establish a humane government.\nThe Dao De Jing is much more reticent about articulating any\nspecific human standard; indeed, in the received version of the text,\nthe line which reads \u201cCut off activity and abandon\npurposefulness\u201d in the Guodian version has been updated to\n\u201cCut off \u2018humaneness\u2019 and abandon\n\u2018rightness\u2019\u201d, thus extending to followers of\nConfucius the treatment initially reserved only for Mohists.\n\nThe best communities, as far as the Dao De Jing is concerned,\nare those that form and flourish naturally, with little guidance from\nabove. Later chapters will add that the community is best if small and\nisolated (DDJ ch. 80), as well as providing theoretical justifications\nfor the success of such communities, as for instance:\n\n\nThe way is revered and virtue is honored not because this is decreed\nby any authority but because it is natural for them to be treated so.\n(DDJ ch. 51)\n\n\nRulers succeed by allowing nature to take its course: by \u201cnot\nacting (wuwei)\u201d. Ironically, some of the Dao De\nJing\u2019s teachings are appropriated as straight-forward\npolitical advice by certain later thinkers. The Han Feizi (on\nwhich see more below), for example, echoes the Dao De Jing in\ncalling for rulers to avoid articulating explicit standards or\ndesires, but it does so in order to make sure that ministers cannot\npander to the ruler, rather than out of a deeper objection to\nstandards as such.\n",
