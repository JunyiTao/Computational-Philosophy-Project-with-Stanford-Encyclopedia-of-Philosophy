    "main_text": "Unity Across Time || Unity and Personal Identity\n5.2 Unity and Personal Identity\n\nIn the history of European philosophy at least since Locke, diachronic\nunified consciousness has been closely linked to personal identity in\nthe philosopher\u2019s sense, i.e., continuing to be a single person,\none and the same person, across time. (The point of the restriction to\nphilosophy is that clinical psychologists use the term quite\ndifferently, as the name for certain aspects of personality and\n\u2018self-conception\u2019.) Whatever may be true of the kind of\ndiachronic unity we just discussed, the kind of diachronic unity\nassociated with personal identity is clearly a kind of memory,\nspecifically, a kind of autobiographical memory. At least since Locke,\nphilosophers have argued that as far back as unified consciousness\nvia the right kind of autobiographical memory extends, there\nextends the person, one and the same person over all this time. The\nright kind of autobiographical memory is memory of the having,\nfeeling, or doing of earlier experiences, emotions, actions, and so\non. As Locke has it, being the same person just is having the\n\u2018same consciousness\u2019. We must be careful here.\nThere is lots of autobiographical memory that is not memory from the\npoint of view of experiencing. A person can remember that so-and-so\nhappened to her without remembering the event, the experience of it,\nor anything else \u2018from the inside\u2019, to use\nShoemaker\u2019s useful metaphor again. Memory theorists\u2019\nstandard categories are not fine-grained enough for our purposes here.\n\n\nSome important philosophers have urged that memory-carried diachronic\nunity is not sufficient for being one person over time. Kant, for\nexample, argued for a dissociation here, in his famous critique of the\nthird paralogism. In Kant\u2019s view, continuity sufficient to\n\u201cretain the thought of the previous subject and so hand it over\nto the subsequent subject\u201d (1781: A363), continuity sufficient\ntherefore for diachronic unity of consciousness, is quite compatible\nwith the \u2018retained thoughts\u2019 being passed from one subject\nto another, compatible therefore with an utter absence of personal\nidentity. If so, diachronic unity is not sufficient for personal\nidentity (Brook 1994: ch. 8). (Note: Locke and Kant may be less far\napart than this brief discussion would suggest. We are merely using\nthem to illustrate the two positions, not discussing either of them\nfully.) \n\nPhenomena relevant to identity in things other than persons can be a\nmatter of degree. This is well illustrated by the famous ship of\nTheseus. Suppose that over the years, a certain ship was rebuilt,\nboard by board, until every bit of it has been replaced. Is the ship\nat the end of the process the ship that started the process? Now\nsuppose that we take all those rotten, replaced boards and reassemble\nthem into a ship. Is this ship the original ship? It seems\nthat there is no determinate answer to these questions. Say what you\nlike, and what you like may vary depending on whether you are an\ninsurance adjuster or a history buff. Many philosophers have insisted\nthat such indeterminacy can never be the case for persons. Identity in\npersons is always completely unambiguous, not something that could\never be a matter of degree (Bishop Joseph Butler [1736] is a\nwell-known example). \n\nBrain bisection cases (described in\n Section 4.1)\n in which, some urge, unified consciousness splits in two may be\nrelevant here (Parfit 1971, 1984). As Parfit argues, the possibility\nof persons (or at any rate minds) splitting and re-fusing puts real\npressure on intuitions about our specialness. Perhaps the continuity\nof persons can be just as tangled and just as much a matter of degree\nas the continuity of any other middle-sized object. \n\nTwo final comments. Nagel (1971) argues that there can be\nindeterminacy in synchronic unity, too (see\n Section 6). One can sympathize\nwith Parfit about diachronic unity and yet have reservations about\nNagel on synchronic unity. Likewise, one should distinguish the\nquestion of whether diachronic unity can be intransitive from the\nquestion discussed in\n Section 6\n of whether synchronic unity can be intransitive.\n",
