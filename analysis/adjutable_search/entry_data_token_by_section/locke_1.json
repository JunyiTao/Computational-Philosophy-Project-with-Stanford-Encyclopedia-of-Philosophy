    "main_text": "Historical Background and Locke\u2019s Life || Locke\u2019s Life up to His Meeting with Lord Ashley in 1666\n1.1 Locke\u2019s Life up to His Meeting with Lord Ashley in 1666\n\nLocke was born in Wrington to Puritan parents of modest means. His\nfather was a country lawyer who served in a cavalry company on the\nPuritan side in the early stages of the English Civil War. His\nfather\u2019s commander, Alexander Popham, became the local MP, and\nit was his patronage which allowed the young John Locke to gain an\nexcellent education. In 1647 Locke went to Westminster School in\nLondon.\n\nFrom Westminster school he went to Christ Church, Oxford, in the\nautumn of 1652 at the age of twenty. As Westminster school was the\nmost important English school, so Christ Church was the most important\nOxford college. Education at Oxford was medieval. Locke, like Hobbes\nbefore him, found the Aristotelian philosophy he was taught at Oxford\nof little use. There was, however, more at Oxford than Aristotle. The\nnew experimental philosophy had arrived. John Wilkins,\nCromwell\u2019s brother in law, had become Warden of Wadham College.\nThe group around Wilkins was the nucleus of what was to become the\nEnglish Royal Society. The Society grew out of informal meetings and\ndiscussion groups and moved to London after the Restoration and became\na formal institution in the 1660s with charters from Charles II. The\nSociety saw its aims in contrast with the Scholastic/Aristotelian\ntraditions that dominated the universities. The program was to study\nnature rather than\n books.[1]\n Many of Wilkins associates were people interested in pursuing\nmedicine by observation rather than the reading of classic texts.\nBacon\u2019s interest in careful experimentation and the systematic\ncollection of facts from which generalizations could be made was\ncharacteristic of this group. One of Locke\u2019s friends from\nWestminster school, Richard Lower, introduced Locke to medicine and\nthe experimental philosophy being pursued by the virtuosi at\nWadham.\n\nLocke received his B.A. in February 1656. His career at Oxford,\nhowever, continued beyond his undergraduate days. In June of 1658,\nLocke qualified as a Master of Arts and was elected a Senior Student\nof Christ Church College. The rank was equivalent to a Fellow at any\nof the other colleges, but was not permanent. Locke had yet to\ndetermine what his career was to be. Locke was elected Lecturer in\nGreek at Christ Church in December of 1660 and he was elected Lecturer\nin Rhetoric in 1663. At this point, Locke needed to make a decision.\nThe statutes of Christ Church laid it down that fifty five of the\nsenior studentships should be reserved for men in orders or reading\nfor orders. Only five could be held by others, two in medicine, two in\nlaw and one in moral philosophy. Thus, there was good reason for Locke\nto become a clergyman. Since his graduation Locke had been studying\nmedicine. Locke decided to become a doctor.\n\nJohn Wilkins had left Oxford with the Restoration of Charles II. The\nnew leader of the Oxford scientific group was Robert Boyle. He was\nalso Locke\u2019s scientific mentor. Boyle (with the help of his\nastonishing assistant Robert Hooke) built an air pump which led to the\nformulation of Boyle\u2019s law and devised a barometer as a weather\nindicator. The work on the air pump led to a controversy with Thomas\nHobbes because Boyle\u2019s explanations of the working of the air\npump were incompatible with Hobbes\u2019 micro-corpuscular theory.\nThis controversy continued for ten years. Boyle was, however, most\ninfluential as a theorist. He was a mechanical philosopher who treated\nthe world as reducible to matter in motion. But he had no\nmicro-corpuscular account of the air.\n\nLocke read Boyle before he read Descartes. When he did read Descartes,\nhe saw the great French philosopher as providing a viable alternative\nto the sterile Aristotelianism he had been taught at Oxford. In\nwriting An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Locke adopted\nDescartes\u2019 \u2018way of ideas\u2019; though it is transformed\nso as to become an organic part of Locke\u2019s philosophy. Still,\nwhile admiring Descartes, Locke\u2019s involvement with the Oxford\nscientists gave him a perspective that made him critical of the\nrationalist elements in Descartes\u2019 philosophy.\n\nIn the Epistle to the Reader at the beginning of the Essay\nLocke remarks:\n\n\nThe commonwealth of learning is not at this time without\nmaster-builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will\nleave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity: but everyone\nmust not hope to be a Boyle or a Sydenham; and in an age that produces\nsuch masters as the great Huygenius and the incomparable Mr. Newton,\nwith some others of that strain, it is ambition enough to be employed\nas an under-labourer in clearing the ground a little, and removing\nsome of the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledge \u2026. (N:\n9\u201310; all quotations are from the Nidditch edition of An\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding [N])\n\n\nLocke knew all of these men and their work. Locke, Boyle and Newton\nwere all founding or early members of the English Royal Society. It is\nfrom Boyle that Locke learned about atomism (or the corpuscular\nhypothesis) and it is from Boyle\u2019s book The Origin of Forms\nand Qualities that Locke took the language of primary and\nsecondary qualities. Sydenham was an English physician and Locke did\nmedical research with him. Sydenham championed careful observation of\ndisease and rejected appeal to underlying causes. Both Boyle and\nNewton did work on colors that did not involve micro-corpuscular\nexplanations. Locke read Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica\nPhilosophiae Naturalis while in exile in Holland, and consulted\nHuygens as to the soundness of its mathematics. Locke and Newton\nbecame friends after Locke\u2019s return from Holland in 1688. It may\nbe that in referring to himself as an \u2018under-labourer\u2019,\nLocke is not only displaying a certain literary modesty, he is\ncontrasting the positive discoveries of these men, with his own\nattempt to show the inadequacies of the Aristotelian and Scholastic\nand to some degree the Cartesian philosophies. There are, however,\nmany aspects of Locke\u2019s project to which this image of an\nunder-labourer does not do justice (see Jolley 1999: 15\u201317).\nWhile the corpuscular philosophy and Newton\u2019s discoveries\nclearly influenced Locke, it is the Baconian program of producing\nnatural histories that Locke makes reference to when he talks about\nthe Essay in the Introduction. He writes:\n\n\nIt shall suffice to my present Purpose, to consider the discerning\nFaculties of a Man, as they are employ\u2019d about the Objects,\nwhich they have to do with: and I shall imagine that I have not wholly\nmisimploy\u2019d my self in the Thoughts I shall have on this\nOccasion, if in this Historical, Plain Method, I can give any Account\nof the Ways, whereby our Understanding comes to attain those Notions\nof Things, and can set down any Measure of the Certainty of our\nKnowledge\u2026. (I.1.2, N: 43\u20134\u2014the three numbers, are\nbook, chapter and section numbers respectively, followed by the page\nnumber in the Nidditch edition)\n\n\nThe \u2018Historical, Plain Method\u2019 is apparently to give a\ngenetic account of how we come by our ideas. Presumably this will\nreveal the degree of certainty of the knowledge based on such ideas.\nLocke\u2019s own active involvement with the scientific movement was\nlargely through his informal studies of medicine. Dr. David Thomas was\nhis friend and collaborator. Locke and Thomas had a laboratory in\nOxford which was very likely, in effect, a pharmacy. In 1666 Lord\nAshley, one of the richest men in England, came to Oxford in order to\ndrink some medicinal waters there. He had asked Dr. Thomas to provide\nthem. Thomas had to be out of town and asked Locke to see that the\nwater was delivered. As a result of this encounter, Ashley invited\nLocke to come to London as his personal physician. In 1667 Locke did\nmove to London becoming not only Lord Ashley\u2019s personal\nphysician, but secretary, researcher, political operative and friend.\nLiving with him Locke found himself at the very heart of English\npolitics in the 1670s and 1680s.\n",
