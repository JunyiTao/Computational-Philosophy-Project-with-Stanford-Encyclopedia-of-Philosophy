    "main_text": "The Bare Theory and Extensions || Many Minds and Hidden Variables\n8.2 Many Minds and Hidden Variables\n\nEverett held that on his formulation of quantum mechanics \u201cthe\nformal theory is objectively continuous and causal, while subjectively\ndiscontinuous and probabilistic\u201d (1956, 77). Albert and Loewer\n(1988) aimed to capture this feature in their many-minds theory. In\ndoing so, they show one way that one might add auxiliary assumptions\nto pure wave mechanics that yield both determinate records and\nstandard forward-looking quantum probabilities.\n\nThe many-minds theory distinguishes between an observer\u2019s\nphysical state and her mental state. Her physical\nstate is given by pure wave mechanics, and associated with her\nphysical state is a continuously infinite set of minds. The\nobserver\u2019s physical state, like all other physical systems,\nalways evolves in the usual deterministic way according to rule 4a,\nbut each mind associated with the observer jumps randomly to a mental\nstate corresponding to one of the Everett branches that is produced in\neach measurement-like interaction. The probability that a particular\nmind will experience a given Everett branch is equal to the norm\nsquared of the amplitude associated with that branch.\n\nOn this dynamics, then, if a measurement interaction between \\(J\\) and\n\\(S\\) produces post-measurement state \n\\[\\alpha|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S + \\beta|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S,\\]\n\n\nthen one should expect \\(|\\alpha|^2\\)proportion of \\(J\\)\u2019s minds\nto end up associated with the result \u201cspin up\u201d (the first\nterm of the expression) and \\(|\\beta|^2\\)proportion of \\(J\\)\u2019s\nminds to end up associated with the result \u201cspin down\u201d\n(the second term of the expression). We will also suppose that the\nmental dynamics is memory-preserving so that once a mind is associated\nwith a particular branch it remains associated with the descendants of\nthat branch. See Barrett 1995 for a discussion of the dynamics.\n\nWhile the many-minds theory involves a strong mind-body dualism, it\nhas several salient virtues. First, there is no need for a physically\npreferred basis. One must choose a preferred basis in order to specify\nthe mental dynamics completely but this choice has nothing to do with\nphysical facts. Rather, it is just characterizes how mental states\nsupervene on physical states. Second, the determinate result problem\nis immediately solved since each mind always has a fully determinate\nset of measurement records. Third, the probability problem is\naddressed by how mental states evolve. Unlike many-worlds theories\nwhere an observer is copied into each post-measurement world, one gets\nthe standard forward-looking quantum probabilities here as predictions\nfor the future experiences of a particular mind. Finally, the\nmany-minds theory is one of the few formulations of quantum mechanics\nthat is (with decohering worlds and GRWf) arguably compatible with the\nconstraints of special relativity. See Hemmo and Pitowsky (2003) and\nBarrett (2020) for discussions.\n\nThe many-minds formulation of quantum mechanics can be thought of as a\nhidden-variable theory much like Bohmian mechanics. See below and the\nentry on\n Bohmian mechanics.\n But here, instead of making particle positions determinate and then\nassuming that determinate particle will provide observers with\ndeterminate measurement records, one simply stipulates that the mental\nstates of the observers are always determinate. While this strategy is\nclearly ad hoc, it is also effective. It immediately provides\nobservers with fully determinate measurement records, and with a\nsuitable stochastic dynamics, it yields the standard forward-looking\nquantum probabilities.\n\nThe many-minds formulation also illustrates the close relationship\nbetween pure wave mechanics and no-collapse hidden-variable theories.\nOne way to get ordinary determinate measurement outcomes and forward\nlooking probabilities is to add a parameter to pure wave mechanics\nthat represents the observer\u2019s records then to give a suitable\ndynamics for that parameter. We will consider another way this might\nwork in the next section.\n",
