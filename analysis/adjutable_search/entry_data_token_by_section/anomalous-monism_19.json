    "main_text": "The Epiphenomenalism Objections || The Causal Constitution of Reasons\n6.3 The Causal Constitution of Reasons\n\nA final point to consider in evaluating the epiphenomenalist\nobjections to Anomalous Monism is the way in which causality enters\ninto the constitution of reasons and reasons-explanations according to\nDavidson. Before we have established the anomalism principle, or go on\nto derive monism, we already know that reasons explain actions by\ncausing them (the \u2018because\u2019 problem discussed in\n 2.2).\n And, as we have seen\n (4.3),\n we know that propositional attitudes and mental contents are\nindividuated, and thus defined, partially in terms of what they are\ncaused by and cause (for attitudes, see Davidson 1987b, 41; for\ncontents, see Davidson 1987a, 444, and extended discussion in the\nsupplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism)). But if something cannot\neven be recognized as a reason unless it is a cause, then the charge\nthat mental properties are causally impotent appears to have\ndifficulty getting any traction. And since these claims are prior to\nthe argument for monism, they are neutral about whatever else reasons\nmust be in order to be causes. So reasons must be recognized as causes\nprior to any discovery that they are also physical events. This\nappears to secure the causal potency of reasons in a way entirely\nindependent of the claim of token-identity. Within Davidson\u2019s\nframework, reasons can only play the rationalizing and explanatory\nrole that they do by virtue of their causal nature.\n\nMany of Anomalous Monism\u2019s epiphenomenalist critics do not\naddress this rich causal background. As we have seen, the background\nis not sufficient by itself to silence all epiphenomenalist concerns.\nBut it does significantly affect how those concerns can be formulated\nand addressed. Anomalous Monism is clearly deeply committed, at a\nnumber of levels, to the causal explanatory relevance of the mental,\nand so charity suggests that we try to understood it in a way such\nthat these commitments are respected. The dual explananda\nstrategy discussed above\n (6.2)\n provides one promising framework for doing this, while at the same\ntime displaying sensitivity to the sorts of concerns driving the\nepiphenomenalist objections.\n",
