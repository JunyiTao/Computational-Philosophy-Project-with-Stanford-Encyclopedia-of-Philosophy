    "main_text": "Plato (and the Aristotelian Tradition)\n2. Plato (and the Aristotelian Tradition)\n\n\nAs with most philosophical matters, Plato is the first in the\nWestern tradition to address the innateness question directly and to\nwork out some of its broader implications. The issue first comes\nup in the Meno, where he puts forth the doctrine of anamnesis,\nwhich holds that all learning is recollection, that everything\nwe will ever learn is already in us before we are\n taught.[3]\nAccording to\nthis view, perception and inquiry remind us of what is innate\nin us. In the dialogue, Socrates supports this view by showing\nthat by simply asking an uneducated slave the right questions, the\nslave can \u2018discover for himself\u2019 a version of the\nPythagorean theorem. Socrates does not elaborate the\nanamnesis claim as much as we would like. Among other\nthings, it is not clear what counts as knowledge in this context, what\nexactly is innate, or how the innate interacts with perception and/or\ninquiry to give rise to knowledge. Still, Nativists have treated\nthe slave-episode in the Meno as a touchstone for their view\n(\u2018Platonism\u2019 has at different times referred to the\ninnateness doctrine). Apart from the interpretive problems\njust noted, the Meno has never been treated as a significant defense of\nNativism, because it is too easy to doubt Socrates\u2019 claim that\nthe slave has not been told the solution. Skeptics see\nSocrates\u2019 \u2018questioning\u2019 as really implicitly feeding\nthe slave the right answers. The upshot is that the demonstration\nhas remained famous as a pedagogical tour de force, but not as\na compelling defense for the doctrine of recollection.\n\n\nIn the later dialogue Phaedo, Socrates argues that the notion of\nequality involved in perceiving a pair of sticks as equal could not\nhave its source in experience and therefore must be\n innate.[4]\nHere the\nfocus is not on knowledge per se, but on concept-application,\nand Plato introduces the theory of forms as part of his explanation: we\nhave an innate grasp of the form Equality, and this (grasp of the) form\nis somehow involved in our perceiving sticks as equal. Here again\nthe case is less than compelling for at least two reasons: first, it is\nhard to pin down exactly how the equality argument is supposed to go,\nand second, we are still not sure about the content of Plato\u2019s\ntheory of forms.\n\n\nDespite the weaknesses in the arguments, Plato\u2019s discussions\nbegin to put key Nativist pieces into play. One could argue,\nfollowing Whitehead\u2019s famous remark, that all the key elements in\nsubsequent Nativist theorizing are anticipated in Plato.\nEspecially important is (i) the form of argument (now termed\nthe poverty of the stimulus argument): some x must be innate\nbecause of the inadequacy of sensory experience, and (ii) the\nfocus on mathematical knowledge and concepts.\n\n\nThough the innateness doctrine is, strictly speaking, an hypothesis\nabout cognitive development, it is attractive to Plato because of its\ndeeper metaphysical and methodological consequences. In the Meno,\ninnateness solves what is sometimes termed the paradox of\ninquiry. The paradox: inquiry into the nature of x only makes\nsense if we don\u2019t know the nature of x, and we have a\nway to determine if a candidate account of x\u2019s nature is\ncorrect. But if we don\u2019t know the nature of x, how\nare we supposed to determine whether a solution is correct?\nPlato\u2019s anamnesis solution sees inquiry as a kind of\ndeep memory recall. The right answer to our question is already\nwithin us. Inquiry, when successful, reminds us of that answer,\nin the same way that we are reminded of the name that goes with a\nface. Once the name is consciously brought to mind, we (somehow)\nknow we have it. In this way, innateness provides a\nrationale for Socrates\u2019 philosophical practice. We once\ngrasped the transcendent Ideas that represent the real nature of\nthings. The trace of that earlier understanding remains in our\nsouls, waiting to be awakened by inquiry. So it makes sense to\nembark on a philosophical search for the nature of Truth, Justice,\nPiety, Courage, and so on.\n\n\nGiven innateness, Socrates ultimately arrives at a doctrine of\npre-existence \u2013 that there is a stage of our existence, before this\nlife, in which we came by our knowledge \u2013 and he goes on to use\npre-existence in an argument for the immortality of the soul.\nThis connection between innateness and immortality prompts\nSocrates\u2019 deathbed discussion of innateness in the Phaedo, where\nthe topic of discussion is the immateriality and immortality of the\nsoul. Plato seems to be aware that the connection between\nNativism and immortality is tenuous, but the purported tie will haunt\n(or edify, depending on one\u2019s perspective) Nativism as it evolves\nin the modern period.\n\n\nPlato is the ur-Nativist, so one might have expected Aristotle to be\nthe ur-Empiricist. They do disagree on innateness, but assigning\nAristotle a place in the innateness controversy is complicated.\nAristotelian thinking rejects Platonic Nativism, in large part because\nit rejects Plato\u2019s poverty of the stimulus argument.\nThe key here is the Aristotelian rejection of the theory of\ntranscendent forms. For Aristotelians, the form of a thing is\nnot a transcendent reality that the thing strives for and\nfails to reach, but is rather part and parcel of the thing\nitself. Material things are forms embodied in matter. For\nAristotle, our grasp of the nature or form of things is based in\nperception, which he understands as a process in which the form of\nthings \u2013 the sensible as well as the intelligible form \u2013 is\nconveyed to the mind (and the matter left\n behind).[5]\nSo there is no poverty of\nthe stimulus to motivate the Nativist account. Variations on this\nanti-Nativist approach dominated European thought for two millennia,\nand Aristotle\u2019s more down-to-earth and less-speculative approach\nto philosophy is reflected in 17th and 18th\ncentury Empiricism. But it would obscure too many\ndifferences \u2013 especially in their views of perception and\nreason \u2013 to put Aristotle at the head of the Empiricist line.\n",
