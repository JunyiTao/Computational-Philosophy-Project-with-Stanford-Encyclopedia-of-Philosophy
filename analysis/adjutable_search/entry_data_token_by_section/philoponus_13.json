To be sure, elusive individual qualities of his mind\nand personality must have played an essential r\u00f4le, but it is\nequally true that philosophical, social, and religious parameters are\nlikely to have supplied conditions which allowed him to carry forward\nhis unprecedented and unparalleled challenge to a widely\naccepted intellectual tradition.\u00a0 In the past, scholars have\nreadily pointed towards the presumed fact that Philoponus was first\nraised as a Christian who later came into privileged contact with\nGreek rationalism; it is supposed that this constellation catalyzed\nhis stance of critical opposition and rejection. However, this\nexplanation is far from satisfactory. Many Christians from birth both\nbefore and after Philoponus were similarly exposed to pagan philosophy\nwithout reacting in a comparable way.  Other scholars have suggested\nthat Philoponus may have received orders from clerical superiors to\nwrite a refutation of Aristotelianism. Again others, especially with a\nview to the invention of the theory of impetus, have sought the roots\nof Philoponus\u2019 intellectual emancipation in broad socio-economic\nchanges which occurred in late antiquity, in particular the\nemancipation of slaves. In whichever way the epithet \u2018Philoponus\u2019 is eventually going to be\nexplained, it seems certain that what essentially enabled Philoponus\nto operate both as a critic of Aristotelianism and as a constructive\nthinker in his own right was somehow tied up with a new understanding of\nwhat one ought to do when one is reading and interpreting the\nphilosophical texts of Plato or Aristotle. Whereas Neoplatonists,\nespecially since Proclus (412\u2013485), tended to approach these ancient\ntexts as a fabric of venerable signs pointing per se and in\nan infallible way to a higher reality and to the truth, Philoponus\nread them (as we do today) as indicators of the thoughts and\nintentions of fallible authors. His more measured hermeneutic\napproach allowed Philoponus to point out problematic tensions, inconsistencies, and\nglaring contradictions in the Aristotelian corpus, and to highlight\ninstances of substantive disagreement between Plato and Aristotle. In\ncontrast, the program of the Neoplatonic tradition he grew up in had been, largely,\neither to ignore such hermeneutical problems or explain them away in an effort to harmonize the rich and diverse tradition of pagan Greek philosophy.\n",
