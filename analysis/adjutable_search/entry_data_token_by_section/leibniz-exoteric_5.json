Additional Exoteric Strategies\n\nWe have seen that the primary function of exoteric texts is to serve\nas intellectual stepping-stones that bridge the gulf between received\nopinions and esoteric truth. Leibniz utilizes a wide range of\nstrategies in his exoteric works, some of which we have already\ndiscussed. Several additional strategies deserve mention as well. Let\nus begin by returning to Leibniz\u2019s remarks on the distinction\nbetween esoteric and exoteric modes of presentation in the 1670\nPreface to Nizolius:\n\n\nThere is\u2026a vast difference between modes of philosophizing\n[philosophandi modus], for one is, if I may so speak,\nesoteric [acroamaticus], another is exoteric\n[exotericus]. The esoteric mode is that in which all things\nare demonstrated; the exoteric is that in which some things are said\nwithout demonstration, but they are still given confirmation by means\nof certain similarities and by dialectical arguments, or even by\narguments based on definition, but not proposed except dialectically,\n[and] they are illustrated by examples and likenesses. Such a kind of\nspeaking is indeed dogmatic or philosophical; however, it is not\nesoteric, that is, not most rigorous, not most exact. (A\nVI.ii.416)\n\n\nOne point that we take Leibniz to be making here is that in exoteric\ncontexts propositions can be treated as hypotheses rather than\nproviding rigorous demonstrations of them. He seems to think that in\ncertain cases his readers will be less hostile to a novel thesis if it\nis presented as a hypothesis than if it is presented as a thesis that\ncan be demonstrated from metaphysical principles. Although\npropositions that are presented hypothetically are not demonstrated\nthey can be motivated and illustrated by examples, analogies,\nmetaphors, and stories (as he says later on). He does not, however,\nclaim that an esoteric work cannot contain analogies, metaphors, and\nthe like. It can include these things, which \u201cgive a pleasing\nrespite to a weary soul\u201d, so long as they are carefully\ndistinguished from the rigorous demonstrations that form the core of\nthe work. Leibniz notes that this difference is also observed in\nmathematics where demonstrations, which are rigorous and exact, are\ncarefully distinguished from scholia in which reasoning can be treated\nin a more familiar manner.\n\nIt is striking to look at a text like the Monadologie through\nthe lens of Leibniz\u2019s remarks about the distinction between\nesoteric and exoteric modes of presentation in the Preface to Nizolius\n(and the other texts that we have considered thus far). The text is\nreplete with analogies, metaphors, and other forms of argumentation\nthat fall well short of rigorous demonstrations. On the assumption\nthat Leibniz remains committed to his early account of the distinction\nbetween the esoteric and the exoteric, it follows that even the\nMonadologie, which has traditionally been taken to be one of\nthe definitive statements of Leibniz\u2019s mature metaphysics,\ncontains numerous exoteric features. As in the case of the\nSyst\u00e8me nouveau, Leibniz does not explicitly flag the\nexoteric features of this work as exoteric. It is thus easy to mistake\nexoteric illustration for esoteric demonstration.\n\nBefore considering a few particular examples of exoteric strategies in\nthe Monadologie (and other texts), it is worth reiterating\nLeibniz\u2019s explanation of why his philosophy was easy to\nmisunderstand. In the letter to Hugony quoted earlier Leibniz said\nthat he needed to present his philosophy in an informal manner because\nit was likely to be misunderstood in relation to the senses.\nThe tendency people have to rely on a sensory-based theory of\nknowledge is one of the primary stumbling blocks that prevent them\nfrom understanding his philosophical system. Many of Leibniz\u2019s\ncore concepts and principles can only be adequately grasped through\nthe intellect, not through the senses or the imagination (see, for\nexample, Leibniz\u2019s remarks on force in De Ipsa Natura\n(G 4:508; AG 159)). One of Leibniz\u2019s main exoteric strategies\nfor dealing with this situation is to utilize sensible\nanalogies, imaginative metaphors, anecdotes, and stories to\nintroduce and motivate his abstract concepts, principles, and theses.\nSuch metaphors and analogies enable his readers to attain an\nintroductory understanding of the thesis or principle in question. Let\nus consider a few examples.\n\nIn explaining the thesis that there is no inter-substantial causation\nbetween finite substances in the Monadologie, Leibniz\nfamously says: \u201cmonads have no windows through which something\ncan enter or leave\u201d (G 6:607; AG 214). This metaphor of being\n\u201cwindowless\u201d helps the reader attain some understanding of\nLeibniz\u2019s thesis, but it will be an imperfect understanding to\nthe extent that it involves conceiving of monads as being\nextended.\n\nLeibniz frequently uses imagistic metaphors to describe God\u2019s\nsustenance of finite substances. Late in the Monadologie, for\nexample, he writes:\n\n\nall created or derivative monads are generated, so to speak, by\ncontinual fulgurations of the divinity from moment to moment. (G\n6:614; AG 219)\n\n\nAnd in the Essais de th\u00e9odic\u00e9e Leibniz uses the\nanalogy of a heavy-laden boat travelling down a river to explain how\nGod and finite substances can be said to co-operate in the production\nof particular effects in the ordinary course of nature (T 30\u20131).\nBoth the metaphor and the analogy provide useful but imperfect devices\nfor conceiving of things that cannot be sensed or imagined, strictly\nspeaking. In reading Leibniz\u2019s texts it is important to\nrecognize that these are only metaphors and analogies\u2014they are\nnot meant to provide metaphysically rigorous descriptions of divine\naction (see Whipple 2015b).\n\nLeibniz is committed to the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. This principle states, roughly, that it is impossible\nfor there to be two numerically distinct substances that are\nqualitatively identical. In discussing this principle Leibniz\nsometimes supports it by appealing to an anecdote and other empirical\nconsiderations. In the anecdote he recalls discussing the principle\nwith an \u201cingenious gentleman\u201d who thought he could find\ntwo perfectly identical leaves. Princess Sophia, who was observing the\nconversation, \u201cdefied him to do it; he ran all over the garden a\nlong time to look for some but it was to no purpose\u201d\n(4th letter to Clarke, G 7:372; AG 327\u20138). Leibniz\nalso defends the principle by appealing to the empirical results of\nthe microscopists: objects that can seem qualitatively identical to\nthe naked eye (two drops of water, or two drops of milk) are shown to\nbe different when viewed under the microscope. Neither the anecdote\nnor the appeal to microscopes is intended to be anything like a\nrigorous proof of the principle of the identity of indiscernibles. A\nrigorous proof would show how the principle is derived a\npriori from other principles such as the principle of sufficient\nreason.\n\nFew people are likely to interpret Leibniz\u2019s anecdote concerning\nthe principle of the identity of indiscernibles as a rigorous\nargument. Other cases are more easily misunderstood, however. Consider\nsection 17 of the Monadologie:\n\n\n\u2026perception, and what depends on it is inexplicable in\nterms of mechanical reasons, that is, through shapes and motions.\nIf we imagine that there is a machine whose structure makes it think,\nsense, and have perceptions, we could conceive it enlarged, keeping\nthe same proportions, so that we could enter into it, as one enters\ninto a mill. Assuming that, when inspecting its interior, we will only\nfind parts that push and pull one another, and we will never find\nanything to explain a perception. And so, we should seek perception in\nthe simple substance and not in the composite or in the machine. (G\n6:609; AG 215)\n\n\nIt is easy to see why this is one of the better-known passages in the\nMonadologie. It contains a vivid imaginative thought\nexperiment that is presented in support of an anti-materialist\nconclusion, namely that perception is inexplicable by means of shapes\nand motions. Given that thought experiments along these lines have\nbeen popular in contemporary philosophy of mind it might seem natural\nto suppose that Leibniz takes the thought experiment to provide a\nconclusive argument for his conclusion (it is sometimes referred to as\n\u201cLeibniz\u2019s Mill Argument\u201d). Although this is not the\nplace to discuss the issue at length, we can say that Leibniz\u2019s\nremarks on the exoteric/esoteric distinction suggest that this might\nnot be the case. It is plausible to think that the passage is designed\nto appeal to people who rely heavily on the imagination in doing\nphilosophy; it could be a heuristic that will help motivate\nLeibniz\u2019s thesis that perception is a property of simple\nsubstances and not of bodies, not a rigorous argument for this\nconclusion .\n\nAs the discussion of Leibniz\u2019s Mill Argument suggests, it is not\nalways easy to recognize when Leibniz is using an exoteric strategy.\nAnother place where an exoteric strategy might be at work is in one of\nhis most frequent \u201carguments\u201d for the theory of simple\nsubstances. Consider the first section of the Principes de la\nNature et de la Grace and the first three sections of the\nMonadologie:\n\n[1]\n \u201cA substance is a being capable of action. It is simple or\ncomposite. A simple substance is that which has no parts.\nA composite substance is a collection\n[l\u2019assemblage] of simple substances, or\nmonads. Monas is a Greek word signifying unity, or\nwhat is one. Composites or bodies are multitudes; and simple\nsubstances\u2014lives, souls, and minds\u2014are unities. There must\nbe simple substances everywhere, because, without simples, there would\nbe no composites\u201d (G 6:598; AG 207).\n[2]\n\u201c1. The Monad, which we shall discuss here, is\nnothing but a simple substance that enters into\ncomposites\u2014simple, that is, without parts. 2. And there must be\nsimple substances, since there are composites; for the composite is\nnothing more than a collection, or aggregate [un amas, ou\naggregatum], of simples. 3. But where there are no parts, neither\nextension, nor shape, nor divisibility is possible. These monads are\nthe true atoms of nature and, in brief, the elements of things\u201d\n(G 6:607; AG 213).\n\n\nThese texts contain important similarities and differences. In\n [1]\n he speaks of \u201ccomposite substances\u201d, which he also\ndescribes as \u201cbodies\u201d, while in\n [2]\n he speaks only of \u201ccomposites\u201d. Setting these differences\naside for the moment, both texts contain a version of what has been\ntermed the \u201cgrounding argument\u201d for simple substances.\nTaken at face value, the texts suggests the following argument:\n\ncomposites exist\na composite is a collection of simple substances\ntherefore, simple substances exist\n\n\nThe reader seems invited in these passages (particularly in\n [1]\n and the first two sections of\n [2])\n to conceive of the relation between simples and composites in a\nstraightforward and intuitive way. If you have a dozen eggs, for\nexample, you must have twelve individual eggs. Trying to argue that\none could have a dozen eggs without having any individual eggs seems a\nhopeless task indeed. The argument also initially lends itself to a\nkind of physical atomism. If one thinks that tables and chairs, for\nexample, are collections of indivisible physical atoms, then the\nargument is once again intuitive and difficult to deny. It becomes\nclear in the third section of text\n [2]\n that the relation between composite and simple cannot be quite this\nstraightforward because the simples are not extended. Leibniz also\nmakes this point in the section that follows\n [1]\n in the Principes de la Nature et de la Grace. But something\nlike the intuitive picture remains. There are composites (bodies).\nComposites are collections of simples. If you put a bunch of simples\ntogether you get a composite. It is natural to think that the relation\nbetween simples and composites is understood on the model of part and\nwhole. Simples are the parts that compose wholes (bodies).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s considered view is far more nuanced and less\nstraightforward than texts\n [1]\n and\n [2]\n suggest. First, Leibniz does not think monads compose bodies in the\nmanner of a part/whole relation. As he explains elsewhere, a part of a\nwhole must be \u201cof the same sort\u201d as the whole (G 3:591).\nMonads and bodies are not of the same sort because only the latter are\nextended. This implies that the parts of an extended body must\nthemselves be extended. Leibniz does assert on a number of occasions\nthat bodies are aggregates of monads (or simple substances). However,\nhe has a technical conception of an aggregate (see Lodge 2001).\nSuppose, for example, that there were a carton of twelve eggs sitting\non a table. This alone would not imply that there was an aggregate of\neggs, strictly speaking. For there to be an aggregate of eggs there\nwould need to be at least two eggs that are perceived by a mind as\nbeing one thing (i.e., by perceiving them as a unity). So you cannot\nmerely add together a bunch of eggs to get an aggregate of eggs.\nSimilarly, you cannot merely add together a bunch of monads to get an\naggregate of monads. You only have an aggregate if there is a mind\nthat perceives the individuals as constituting one thing. The precise\ndetails of how one should understand Leibniz\u2019s claim that bodies\nare aggregates of monads is a matter of scholarly controversy that we\nneed not engage here. It will suffice to make the following points.\nThe fact that bodies are aggregates of monads implies that bodies\ndepend ontologically on monads but it does not imply that the relation\nbetween monads and bodies is a part/whole relation. As Leibniz\nexplains to De Volder,\n\n\nproperly speaking, matter isn\u2019t composed of constitutive\nunities, but results from them\u2026substantial unities aren\u2019t\nreally parts, but the foundations of phenomena. (G 2:268; AG 179)\n\n\nOnce one becomes aware of Leibniz\u2019s technical notion of an\naggregate and of certain aspects of his conception of the part-whole\nrelation, it becomes less clear exactly how the \u201cgrounding\nargument\u201d in texts\n [1]\n and\n [2]\n is supposed to work. The intuitive appeal of the argument seems to\ndepend, at least in part, on assuming a straightforward account of the\nrelation between bodies and monads that Leibniz does not actually\nendorse. Leibniz seems to encourage this oversimplified account of the\nrelation by omitting an explanation of his notion of an aggregate and\nof his account of the part-whole relation, among other things. This\nsuggests that Leibniz is not trying to provide a fully rigorous\nargument for the existence of simple substances or a full explanation\nof the relation between monads and bodies in the Monadologie\nor the Principes de la Nature et de la Grace. What Leibniz is\ndoing, one might think, is helping his readers attain a preliminary\ngrasp of the relation between bodies and simple substances\u2014to\nhelp them recognize that simple substances provide some kind of\nontological grounding for the world of bodies. By introducing the view\nin the form of a simple and intuitive argument Leibniz helps to\nmotivate the radical idea that an infinity of immaterial mind-like\nsimple substances exist. The reader will thus be more likely to take\nthe view seriously enough to consider the further elaborations of the\ntheory that are presented in the remainder of the texts. This is not\nto deny that Leibniz might have had a fully demonstrative\n\u201cgrounding argument\u201d for the existence of simple\nsubstances, or that he wanted the fully demonstrative argument to be\nconsistent with the versions of the argument that are presented in\ntexts\n [1]\n and\n [2].\n The point is that Leibniz omits too many essential distinctions and\ndetails for even a very discerning reader to be able to reconstruct a\ndemonstrative argument merely on the basis of texts\n [1]\n or\n [2].\n On this reading\nsignificant portions of the Monadologie and the Principes\nde la Nature et de la Grace are exoteric in content and form.\nThey serve to introduce some of the central features of\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics while omitting many important details\n(more details are omitted in the latter text, as we will soon\nsee).\n\nLet us now consider one notable difference between the\nMonadologie and the Principes de la Nature et de la\nGrace. In the Principes de la Nature et de la Grace\nLeibniz speaks of \u201ccomposite substances\u201d while in the\nMonadologie he only speaks of \u201ccomposites\u201d. The\ndifference is puzzling. In the Monadologie Leibniz is\ntypically taken to be presenting a strictly monadological metaphysics\naccording to which simple substances are the only finite substances.\nBodies exist and animals exist, but they are not substances (roughly\nspeaking he thinks that an animal is a dominant monad and its organic\nbody, which is itself an aggregate of monads). A number of texts\nsuggest that neither bodies nor animals are true unities, and only a\ntrue unity (an unum per se) can qualify as a substance,\nstrictly speaking. Any reality that bodies and animals possess is in\nsome way derivative of the reality of simple substances. The obvious\npuzzle is that Leibniz speaks of simple and composite\nsubstances in the Principes de la Nature et de la Grace. What\nare we to make of these seemingly divergent claims?\n\nOne way of accounting for divergent claims in different texts is to\nsay that Leibniz had different views on the issue over time. There is\nno question that Leibniz\u2019s views on substance changed to some\ndegree over the course of his career (exactly how much they changed is\none of the most contentious issues in Leibniz scholarship). However,\nthe developmental strategy is more difficult (though not impossible)\nto deploy in the present case because both texts were written around\nthe same time in 1714. Another possibility (suggested in the secondary\nliterature) is that Leibniz is exploring different theories of\nsubstance at this point in his career. Though he is tempted by a\nstrictly monadological metaphysics (as presented in the\nMonadologie), he is also considering an ontology that\ncountenances the existence of simple substances and corporeal\nsubstances (where corporeal substances are \u201canimals\u201d as\ndescribed in the previous paragraph). Leibniz is laying out this\nlatter theory in The Principes de la Nature et de la Grace\n(see Hartz 2007). There are some prima facie reasons for\nresisting an interpretation along these lines (though it cannot be\nconclusively ruled out). First, Leibniz does not describe himself as a\n\u201ctheory pluralist\u201d with respect to substance. As we have\nseen, Leibniz consistently refers to his philosophy as a (single)\nsystem. This is one of the things that make it amenable to the\ngeometric model of demonstration.  When Leibniz addresses the fact\nthat he has not unfolded his entire system in a single work, he\nemphasizes that this is not because he has not thought the system all\nthe way through. In one of his less modest moments he writes to\nBurnett, for example:\n\n\nI never write anything in philosophy that I do not treat by\ndefinitions and axioms, though I do not always give it that\nmathematical air, which puts people off, for one must speak in a\nfamiliar manner [familierement] to be read by ordinary\npeople\u2026I would even dare to say that I have established\nsufficiently in all matters of thought what is most fundamental to\nthem, and that I no longer have any need to reason about them. Thus\nwhat you wish for me to do was already done a long time ago. I have\nquite satisfied myself on nearly all matters of reasoning. (10\nDecember 1705 letter to Burnett; G 3:302\u20133)\n\n\nAnother place where Leibniz emphasizes the systematicity of his\nphilosophy is in his correspondence with Des Bosses:\n\n\nMy views certainly are connected with each other in such a way that no\nlink can be removed without the chain\u2019s being broken. From the\nvery consideration of possible worlds and God\u2019s choice, it\nfollows both that he has chosen the best and that he has chosen it\nwith one decree, whose object, obviously, is the chosen world.\n(October 1708 letter to Des Bosses, LR 113)\n\nIf only the attribute of incomprehensibility were proper to God alone!\nThen, our hope of knowing nature would be greater. But it is all too\ntrue that there is no part of nature that could be known perfectly by\nus, and the very interconnection of things proves this. No creature,\nhowever elevated, can perceive distinctly or comprehend the infinite\nat the same time; but, on the contrary, whoever comprehends even one\npart of matter likewise comprehends the whole universe on account of\nthe same interconnection I mentioned. My principles are such that they\ncan hardly be separated one from another. Whoever knows one well,\nknows them all. (7 November 1710 letter to Des Bosses, LR 189)\n\n\nMore could be said about the context of these passages and exactly how\nthey should be interpreted. At the very least, however, these texts do\nnot suggest that Leibniz saw himself as unsure about which theory of\nsubstance to endorse. That being said, Leibniz wrote a considerable\namount on the theory of monads and bodies between 1710 and 1714. Did\nLeibniz\u2019s views on substance evolve during those intervening\nyears?\n\nTo answer this question one would need to delve deeply into\nLeibniz\u2019s long and fascinating correspondence with Des Bosses\n(as well as other texts). This is obviously not the place to provide\nsuch an investigation, but we can briefly summarize a standard\ninterpretation of one of the central moments of the correspondence\n(see Look and Rutherford\u2019s introduction [2007] to the\nLeibniz-Des Bosses Correspondence, xlix\u2013lxxviii). As a Jesuit\npriest, Des Bosses was interested in determining whether\nLeibniz\u2019s philosophy could provide an adequate ontological\nframework for the doctrine of transubstantiation. The central point of\ncontention in their discussion of this issue concerned the reality of\ncorporeal substance. Did Leibnizian corporeal substances meet the\ncriteria for being a substance in the strict sense of the term? On a\nmonadological view a corporeal substance (or animal) is a dominant\nmonad united with an organic body, which is itself an aggregate of\nsubordinate monads. The \u201cunion\u201d of a dominant monad and\nits organic body consists in certain harmonious perceptual relations\nthat obtain between the dominant monad and the subordinate monads of\nthe organic body. This rather weak notion of union is not sufficient\nto make the dominant monad and its organic body truly one being. This\nimplies that a corporeal substance is not a substance strictly\nspeaking because it does not possess per se unity. Des Bosses\nthought that this reductive view of corporeal substance did not\nprovide a robust enough conception of the reality of bodies to\nproperly ground the doctrine of transubstantiation. In response to Des\nBosses\u2019 concerns Leibniz developed the notion of a substantial\nbond (vinculum substantiale). This substantial bond\n(superadded by God) could serve as a kind of metaphysical glue uniting\nthe dominant monad and the subordinate monads of an organic body.\nLeibniz told Des Bosses that the only way for a corporeal substance to\nbe a per se unity would be through one of these substantial\nbonds. Arguably, Leibniz did not endorse the theory himself; he told\nDes Bosses that he preferred the more ontologically parsimonious\nversion of the theory of monads (letter of 16 June 1712; LR 255).\n\nThe correspondence with Des Bosses has thus been taken to provide\nsupport for the interpretive thesis that Leibniz\u2019s mature\nontology of finite substance countenances the existence of simple\nsubstances exclusively (but see Garber 2009 for an opposing view). The\ncorrespondence also shows, importantly, that the mere occurrence of\nthe word \u201ccorporeal substance\u201d in a text does not\nimmediately imply that Leibniz takes corporeal substances to be\nsubstances, strictly speaking. These conclusions might help\nresolve the apparent tension between Leibniz\u2019s remarks on\nsubstance in the Monadologie and the Principes de la\nNature et de la Grace. The text of the Monadologie more\naccurately reflects Leibniz\u2019s considered position because it\nonly characterizes simple substances as \u201csubstances\u201d. The\nPrincipes de la Nature et de la Grace, in contrast, is less\nrigorous on this issue (more exoteric) because it uses the term\n\u201ccomposite substance\u201d when composites are not substances,\nstrictly speaking (Rutherford 1995: 281\u20132).\n\nBut why would Leibniz use a term like \u201ccomposite\nsubstance\u201d in the Principes de la Nature et de la Grace\nif it did not accurately reflect his considered position? Here is one\npossible answer. In presenting his theory of simple substances Leibniz\nwas concerned to avoid a fundamental misunderstanding. The\nmisunderstanding is that if the only true substances are unextended\nsimple substances, then bodies must be mere illusions. Leibniz does\nnot think that bodies are mere illusions. His view of bodies (from the\nperspective of the theory of monads) is, roughly, that they are\n\u201creal but not fully real\u201d. To adequately grasp\nLeibniz\u2019s view one must understand that his ontology\ncountenances different levels or degrees of reality. Simplifying\nthings considerably, these degrees range from the ideal (the least\nreal) to the phenomenal (mid-grades of reality) to the level of monads\n(the most real). Bodies fall within the purview of the phenomenal:\nthey are more real than entities that are purely ideal (e.g.,\nspace) but less real than simple substances. Bodies are\naccorded an enhanced degree of reality (in comparison to merely ideal\nentities) because they are well founded on the reality of monads. The\nprecise nature of this \u201cwell founding\u201d\u2014and of\nLeibniz\u2019s ontological scheme more generally\u2014is a\ncomplicated and controversial matter. The nuanced framework (however\none might fill in the details) does not lend itself to a\nstraightforward and intuitive presentation in several paragraphs of\ntext (see Whipple 2020 for a more detailed account).\n\nOne can reasonably view the Principes de la Nature et de la\nGrace as one of the most exoteric presentations of\nLeibniz\u2019s theory of monads. In the text he omits nearly all of\nthe details of his nuanced ontological scheme. He describes bodies as\n\u201ccomposite substances\u201d so that his reader will recognize\nthat both simple substances and bodies are \u201creal\u201d. By\noveremphasizing the degree of reality that he grants bodies he is able\nto introduce the theory of monads in a way that makes it appear less\nfar removed from received opinions. It also helps avoid the serious\nmisunderstanding that bodies are mere illusions\u2014a\nmisunderstanding that one could easily fall into in the absence of a\nfull presentation of Leibniz\u2019s ontological scheme.\n\nThis very brief sketch of an \u201cexoteric resolution\u201d of the\ntextual discrepancy between Leibniz\u2019s use of the word\n\u201csubstance\u201d in the Monadologie and the\nPrincipes de la Nature et de la Grace provides an alternative\nto the \u201cdevelopmental\u201d and \u201ctwo theory\u201d\nreadings of the relevant passages mentioned earlier. It suggests a\nmore general moral for Leibniz scholarship. Whenever one is faced with\ntexts that appear to provide conflicting remarks on an issue, it is\nimportant to consider whether an exoteric strategy that could resolve\nthe apparent conflict might be at work. It is not easy to determine\nwhen an exoteric strategy is at work given that Leibniz rarely flags\nthe features of his works that are exoteric within the works\nthemselves. One must consider Leibniz\u2019s general remarks on\nexoteric strategies along with any additional texts that explicitly or\nimplicitly bear on the passages in question. It is only once all of\nthese texts have been examined that one can argue that a particular\ninterpretive hypothesis is the best all things considered. In some\ncases an esoteric/exoteric interpretation will be the most plausible;\nin other cases it might be more plausible to view Leibniz as having\nchanged his views over time, or as having not fully resolved a\ndifficult problem, among other possibilities (see Whipple 2010 for\ndiscussion of a problem where it is particularly difficult to discern\nthe most plausible interpretation).\n",
