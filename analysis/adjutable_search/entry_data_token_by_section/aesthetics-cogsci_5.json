    "main_text": "Pictures, Imagination and Perception\n6. Pictures, Imagination and Perception\n\nWollheim (1980) said that what is distinctive about pictorial\nrepresentation is its capacity to generate a certain kind of\nexperience: the experience of \u201cseeing the subject in the\npicture\u201d. For many this has seemed to capture something deeply\nimportant about the nature of depictive representation, though\nWollheim\u2019s specific claims about it are disputed. What exactly\nis seeing-in? One subsequent suggestion has been that we see\nsomething, X, in a picture when we experience a resemblance\nbetween the outline shape visible in the picture and the outline shape\nthat would be presented from that same perspective by X\n(Hopkins 1998; for a related proposal see Peacocke 1987). Another\nproposal is that we see X in a picture when we are prompted\nby it to imagine, of our act of seeing the picture, that it is a\nseeing of X (Walton 1992). Is cognitive science able to help\nus adjudicate between rival theories in this area? It does look as if\nthese ostensibly philosophical theories are committing themselves, if\nsomewhat vaguely, on empirical issues. Surely, we cannot settle from\nthe armchair whether the perception of pictures draws on imaginative\ncapacities. Scientists have gone a long way towards locating areas of\nthe brain implicated in certain kinds of functions, emotion and the\nforms of perception being good examples. But we are not similarly able\nto localise imaginative activity and there may be an in-principle\nbarrier to our doing so; there is some reason to suppose that there\nare not dedicated mechanisms of imaginative activity, but that\nimagining involves the reuse of systems designed for other purposes.\nThis issue has been a central contention in the debate over how we\nunderstand the minds of other people, a debate originally drawn in\nterms of two opposing outlooks, theory-theory and simulation theory,\nthough other approaches have come into view (Gallagher & Hutto\n2008). Theory-theory attributes to us a (perhaps tacit) theory of the\nmental states of others, their connection to action and so forth, from\nwhich we derive predictions and explanations of behaviour (Fodor 1992;\nCarruthers 1996). Simulationism, by contrast, argues that we have a\ncapacity to use our own mental systems of inferring and deciding to\nmodel or simulate the thoughts and decisions of others (Gordon 1986).\nWhile Heal has emphasised what she takes to be the a priori\nprinciple that when we examine the thinking of another person we have\nto reproduce in our own minds the contents of and the logical\nrelations between the propositions thought (1986), others have\ndeveloped an empirically oriented version, postulating causal\nmechanisms by which practical and theoretical reasoning can be taken\n\u201coff-line\u201d, or disconnected from experiential inputs and\nbehavioural outputs (A. I. Goldman 1989). It has been suggested that\nthe simulation approach, understood largely in this empirically\noriented way, enables us to explain a good deal about our interest in\nand responses to fiction (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002). Questions\nabout causally effective mental architecture have played a role in\nother aesthetic debates such as the explanation of our capacity to\nbecome immersed in a narrative (Schellenberg 2013) and of the contrary\ntendency to \u201cresist\u201d imaginative involvement with stories\nwe perceive as morally or in other ways problematic (Weinberg &\nMeskin 2006; Miyazono & Liao 2016).\n\nWhile some of these ideas come with a detailed \u201cboxology\u201d\nthat describes the cognitive implementation of the proposal, they are\ngenerally the product of work at the more philosophical and\nspeculative end of inquiry into the architecture of mind where\nevidence is at best very indirect. An exception is the suggestion that\nthere is empirical confirmation for Wollheim\u2019s (1998) notion of\ntwofoldness in picture perception, according to which spectators are\nsimultaneously aware of both the surface qualities of the picture and\nthe depicted content. In particular, it has been argued that\n\n\nthe twofold experience of pictures Wollheim talks about corresponds to\nthe dichotomy between our dorsal visual processing of the surface of\nthe picture and our ventral visual processing of the depicted scene.\n(Nanay 2011: 464)\n\n\nSupport for this idea comes from evidence that people with damage to\ntheir ventral processing often have difficulty deciphering the content\nof a picture without corresponding difficulty in perceiving the\nordinary properties of the surface of the picture (Turnbull, Driver,\n& McCarthy 2004). This illustrates another way that the\ninvestigation of mechanisms may further aesthetic inquiry. An\naesthetic phenomenon\u2014in this case twofoldness\u2014is\npostulated and the question arises as to whether there is a plausible\nstory about how this is implemented. If no such story were available,\ndoubt would be thrown on the claim.\n",
