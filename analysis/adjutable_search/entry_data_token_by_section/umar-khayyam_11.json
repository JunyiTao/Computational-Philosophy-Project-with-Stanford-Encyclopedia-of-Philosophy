    "main_text": "The Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t (Quatrains) || Here and Now\n3.3 Here and Now\nFor Khayyam the poet, \u201cthe tale of the seventy-two nations,\u201d by which he refers to organized branches of Islam, and of religions in general, and traditional metaphysical beliefs (mainly Platonic and neo-Platonic), are merely flight of fancy, for the human condition, which he describes as a \u201csorrow laden nest,\u201d at least in part contradicts many such beliefs. The art of living in the present, a theme dealt with in Sufi literature, is a type of wisdom that must be acquired, since living for the hereafter and heavenly rewards is conventional wisdom, and more suitable for the masses. On this point, Khayyam asserts:\n\nToday is thine to spend, but not to-morrow,\nCounting on morrow breedeth naught but sorrow;\nOh! Squander not this breath that heaven hath lent thee,\nNor make too sure another breath to borrow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Whinfield 2001, 30; modified by Aminrazavi)\n\nAnd also:\n\nWhat matters if I feast, or have to fast?\nWhat if my days in joy or grief are cast?\nFill me with Thee, O Guide! I cannot ken\nIf breath I draw returns or fails at last.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Whinfield 2001, 144)\n\nKhayyam\u2019s emphasis on living in the present, or as Sufis say, \u201cSufi is the son of time,\u201d along with his use of other Sufi metaphors such as wine, intoxication and love making, have been interpreted by some scholars as merely mystical allegories.[9] Although a mystical interpretation of the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t has been advocated by some, it remains the view of a minority of scholars.\nThe complexity of the world according to Khayyam the mathematician-astronomer necessitates the existence of a creator and sustainer of the universe; and yet on a more immediate and existential level, he finds no reason or meaning for human existence. He seems to want to hold both the idea of \u201ca necessary existence\u201d and what necessarily follows from it (as a divine character is always present and sometimes critically addressed in his quatrains) and the immediate intuition of the presence of apparently unexplainable suffering, evil, and meaninglessness in this world. This leads to the theme of doubt and bewilderment. A practical response to this existential crisis opens room for a number of Epicurean and Stoic themes in Khayyam\u2019s view, such as being \u201cthe son of time,\u201d or the art of living in presence.\n",
