    "main_text": "Theory of Democracy and Constitutional Theory\n4. Theory of Democracy and Constitutional Theory\n\n\nSchmitt\u2019s conception of politics tends to radically dissociate\ndemocracy from liberalism and, more controversially, from the\nconstituted, rule-bound practices of popular election and parliamentary\nlegislation that characterize the ordinary workings of modern\ndemocracy. How, then, did Schmitt apply his radical perspective to the\nsphere of constituted democratic politics in the Weimar Republic? (Valuable overviews in Dyzenhaus 1997; Kennedy 2004; Neumann 2015, 77\u2013304; Preuss 2016.)\n\n\nIn The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy, Schmitt understands\ndemocracy as the self-rule of the people. In a democratic polity, the\ndecisions taken by the rulers express the will of the people (CPD\n25\u20136). However, the principle of democracy, taken in the\nabstract, is open to different and competing interpretations. In\npolitical practice, the identity of the ruling will with the will of\nthe people is never a simple given. Rather, it is always the result of\nan act of identification. When political decisions are taken through\nmajority vote, the will of the majority is identified with the will of\nthe people, and every citizen is expected to obey regardless of\nwhether he voted with the majority (CPD 26\u201330). But what,\nSchmitt asks, is the basis of this identification? If a majority can\noverrule a minority, and identify its will with the will of the\npeople, why should it not be possible for the will of a minority to\nexpress the will of the people?  What if a group of democratic\nrevolutionaries want to establish a democracy in a society where most\npeople are opposed to the principle of democracy? Would they not be\njustified, from a democratic point of view, to abandon majority rule,\nto identify their own will with the true will of the people, and to\nsubject their compatriots to a re-educative dictatorship? Schmitt\nsuggests that such a dictatorship would still have to be considered\ndemocratic, since it still appeals to the idea that political rule\nought to be based on the will of the people (CPD 28\u201330). Once\none accepts this claim, the conclusion that Schmitt aims to establish\nin The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy will follow: The electoral\ninstitutions that we usually take to be paradigmatically democratic\nare not, in truth, any more intimately connected with the principle of\ndemocracy than a dictatorship in the name of the people. The latter was to be legitimated by plebiscites, initiated by a charismatic leader, in which the people, Schmitt argued, should be allowed to give or withhold approval, but never to initiate the question (CPD 32; VV). But this conclusion must surely be an overstatement. Even democratic\ndictatorship, however crucial to the establishment of democracy, is\nexceptional and limited in time. Hence, there must be a\ncharacteristically democratic condition of legal normality, and a\ntheory of democracy should tell us what it is.  Schmitt\u2019s apparent\nattempt to dissociate the idea of democracy from any particular method\nof will-formation fails to explain why the democratic tradition has\nconsidered institutional provisions like the election of officials or\nthe extension of the franchise to be characteristically\ndemocratic.\n\n\nSchmitt acknowledges this problem in his Constitutional\nTheory. The idea that legitimate political rule must make appeal\nto the will of the people, Schmitt now claims, is grounded in the\nvalue of political equality (CT 255\u201367). Political equality\ncommits us to the denial of natural differences in status among\ncitizens. Per se, no citizen has more of a right than any other\ncitizen else to hold political power.  Every citizen, therefore,\nshould participate on equal terms, as far as practically feasible, in\nthe exercise of political rule. What is more, where it is necessary to\nappoint public officials with special powers not shared by all\ncitizens, these officials must be appointed through periodical\nelections. The value of political equality, then, explains why certain\nforms of will formation are considered to be more intimately\nassociated with the idea of democracy than others (CT\n280\u20135). However, Schmitt\u2019s concession to the value of equality\ncomes with a twist. The political equality that constitutes a\npolitical community, Schmitt argues, cannot be based on the\nnon-exclusive equality of all human beings as moral persons. Every\npolitical community is based on a constitutive distinction between\ninsiders and outsiders or friends and enemies. A democratic political\ncommunity, as much as any other, must therefore rest on some marker of\nidentity and difference that can ground an exclusive form of political\nequality which will only apply to insiders (CT 257\u201364). Schmitt\ngoes on to define democracy as a political system characterized by the\nidentity of ruler and ruled. Ruler and ruled are identical if and only\nif the rulers and all the ruled share the substantive identity that\nthe community as a whole, in deciding who its enemies are, has chosen\nto turn into the basis of its political identity (CT 264\u20137; See\nalso CPD 8\u201317).\n\n\nIf all those who live together as legally recognized citizens of a\nconstituted democratic state happen to distinguish between friend and\nenemy in exactly the same way, the equal participation of all citizens\nin the political process and the electoral appointment of officials\nwould indeed be a requirement of democratic political justice. It\nwould be possible, moreover, to identify the outcomes of the political\nprocess with the will of the people, and to consider them\ndemocratically legitimate, even if some citizens find themselves in a\ntemporary minority. But the reason why it has become possible to\nidentify the outcomes of democratic procedure with the will of the\npeople is not to be sought in inherent virtues of democratic procedure\nitself. Rather, the identification is possible only in virtue of the\nprior identity of all citizens as members of a group constituted by a\nshared friend-enemy distinction (CPD 10\u201314; LL 27\u201328). If, contrary to\nour initial assumption, those who live together as legally recognized\ncitizens of a constituted democratic state do not share a political\nidentity in Schmitt\u2019s sense, the identity of the rulers with all the\nruled will no longer obtain, and the constituted democratic state will\nno longer be truly democratic. The rule of the majority will\ndegenerate into an illegitimate form of indirect rule of one social\nfaction over another (HV 73\u201391; LL 17\u201336; L\n65\u201377). Sovereign dictatorship, then, is still necessary to\ncreate the substantive equality that grounds the legitimate operation\nof constituted, rule-governed democratic politics.\n\n\nThe understanding of democracy so far outlined informs Schmitt\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Weimar constitution (Dyzenhaus 1997,\n38\u2013101; Caldwell 1997, 85\u2013119; Scheuerman 1999,\n61\u201384; Hofmann 2002, 117\u201352; Kennedy 2004,\n119\u201353; Neumann 2015, 77\u2013304; Preuss 2016; Schupmann 2017). A democratic constitution, Schmitt argues in his\nConstitutional Theory, is the product of an exercise of\nconstituent power on the part of a politically united people (CT\n75\u201377, 125\u201330, 140\u20136). The creation of a democratic\nconstitution must not be thought of along the lines of a social\ncontract, since it presupposes the prior existence of a people as a\npolitical unity, as explicated in the Concept of the\nPolitical (CT 112\u20133; B\u00f6ckenf\u00f6rde 1998). If the\npeople did not already exist, Schmitt reasons, it would not be able to\ngive itself a constitution, and a constitution not given by the people\nitself to itself would not be a democratic constitution. In giving\nitself a constitution a politically united people determines the\nconcrete form of its political existence, but it does not bring itself\ninto existence. Since a democratic constitution is a unilateral\ndetermination, on the part of an already existing people, of the\nconcrete form of its political existence, the people\u2019s constituent\npower must be inalienable. As long as a people exists it can always\ndecide to give itself a new constitution (CT 140\u20131). Schmitt\u2019s\ntheory of constituent power has recently received a lot of attention\nfrom authors who believe it might help to reinvigorate constituted\ndemocracy (Kalyvas 2008, 79\u2013186; Colon-Rios 2012).\n\n\nSchmitt recognizes that it would be implausible to assume that a\nwritten constitution represents a conscious choice of the popular\nsovereign down to its last detail. The revolution of the German people\nin 1918 that led to the creation of the Weimar constitution, for\nexample, expressed the German people\u2019s conscious decision for a\ndemocratic, republican, and federal state, committed to the principles\nof the rule of law, and endowed with a parliamentary system of\nlegislation and government (CT 77\u20138). But in addition to these\ngeneral principles of political and social order, the Weimar\nconstitution came to contain a large number of specific provisions\nthat do not reflect conscious decisions of the popular sovereign (CT\n82\u20138). Schmitt argues that it would be wrong to treat such\nparticular constitutional norms as possessing the same normative force\nas the people\u2019s decision for a concrete form of political existence,\nwhich is expressed in the basic principles implicit in the\nconstitution. It is wrong, therefore, to regard a constitution as\nnothing more than the set of all particular constitutional norms, and\nto assume that all these norms are equally subject to constitutional\namendment. Even where, as in Weimar, the positive constitution\nprovides a procedure that seems to allow for the amendment of any\nparticular constitutional norm, it is to be understood, Schmitt\nargues, that the core constitutional principles chosen by the\nconstituent power are not open to formal abrogation. To claim that\nthey are is to advocate a usurpation of the constituent power of the\npeople by a mere party or faction (CT 77\u201382, 147\u201358).\n\n\nSchmitt thinks that this argument will hold even where an initiative\nto amend the constitution requires a supermajority. Political\ndecision-taking on the basis of the simple majority rule is legitimate\nonly if citizens share a political identity, in which case they will\nalso agree on a set of constitutional fundamentals. Where they don\u2019t,\nthe identity of ruler and all ruled no longer obtains, and majority\nrule will consequently become a mere license for the oppression of\nthose who happen to be in the minority. Such oppression, Schmitt\nargues, does not become any more legitimate where a super-majoritarian\nrequirement is raised and met. That a numerical majority is relatively\nlarge and a numerical minority is relatively small does not entail,\nonce there is no longer a shared political identity, that we are any\ncloser to an identity between the ruler and all the ruled than in the\ncase of a simple majority (LL 39\u201358). Schmitt concludes that it\nwould be absurd to take the view that the formal procedures of\namendment provided by a democratic constitution can legitimately be\nused to overturn its constitutional fundamentals (LL\n85\u201394). Before 1933, Schmitt employed this argument to oppose a\nNazi seizure of power (Machtergreifung) in legal form\n(Bendersky 1983, 107\u201391). It should also be noted that his claim\nthat there must be limits to constitutional amendment in a democratic\nconstitution based on the principle of popular sovereignty, and that\nthese limits legitimate the notion of a \u2018militant democracy\u2019 that is\nwilling to curb individual rights to defend itself, has been very\ninfluential in postwar constitutional thought, in Germany and\nelsewhere (see Ehmke 1953, 33\u201353; Fox and Nolte 1995,\n18\u201320; Conrad 1999; Colon-Rios 2012, 126\u201351). However,\nSchmitt\u2019s constitutional theory did not amount to an unqualified\ndefence of liberal democracy. While Schmitt denies the possibility of\nchanging the fundamental nature of an established constitution from\nwithin, and decries the dangers of the tyranny of a mere numerical\nmajority, he nevertheless affirms the possibility of fundamental\nconstitutional change through sovereign dictatorship, and he makes it\nclear that the German people, in a renewed exercise of their\nconstituent power, might legitimately choose a non-liberal and\nnon-parliamentarian form of democracy (CT 75\u20137). The exclusionary\nnature of the friend-enemy distinction that is to be enforced through\nextra-legal sovereign dictatorship, to provide a basis for the normal\nfunctioning of the constitutional order, throws further doubt on the\ndemocratic nature of Schmitt\u2019s constitutional theory (see\nKraft\u2013Fuchs 1930; Vinx 2013a).\n\n\nSchmitt\u2019s ambiguous position towards the Weimar system was equally on\ndisplay in his interpretation of the dictatorial powers of the\npresident of the Weimar Republic under art. 48 of the Weimar\nconstitution (Dyzenhaus 1997, 70\u201385; Vinx 2016). By partially assimilating\nthe president to a sovereign dictator, Schmitt defended an unusually\nextensive interpretation of the president\u2019s authority that in effect\nsubjected all constitutional rights to the discretionary interference\nof the executive headed by the president (See DP). Liberal rights were\nto be respected, as the German people had chosen to create a liberal\nconstitution, but only on the condition that public order and security\nhad been secured. For Schmitt, individual freedoms, even where\nconstitutionally guaranteed, are to be regarded as concessions of the\nstate to the individual since they are subject, in the last instance,\nto suspension through a sovereign decision on the exception (CT\n80\u20131, 156\u20138, 235\u201352). Schmitt, moreover, vehemently\nfought against the idea that the protection of the constitution ought\nto be assigned to a constitutional court. A constitutional court,\nSchmitt argued, would either have to limit itself to uncontroversial\ncases in which constitutional law provides determinate guidance or\ntake upon itself the responsibility to determine the political\nidentity of the people.  But for a court to assume that responsibility\nwould, in Schmitt\u2019s view, have amounted to an illegitimate usurpation\nof the constituent power of the people, as much as an attempt to bring\nabout fundamental constitutional change through formal constitutional\namendment (HV 12\u201348; TV 26\u201341).\n\n\nSchmitt apparently hoped, throughout the Weimar Republic\u2019s years of\nrelative stability, that presidential dictatorship in defence of the\nexisting constitution might be sufficient to create a condition of\nnormality that would allow the Weimar Republic to function. But this\nhope was disappointed in the final crisis of the Weimar Republic.\nSchmitt\u2019s writings during that crisis started to toy with the view\nthat the president should attempt to assume a role much closer to full\nsovereign dictatorship than even Schmitt\u2019s own interpretation of art.\n48 would have permitted and to engineer an authoritarian\ntransformation of the positive constitution (LL 85\u201394). This\nproject failed when the Nazis managed to take power through the kind\nof abuse of constitutional procedure that Schmitt had warned against\n(Kennedy 2004, 154\u201383). After a very brief period of hesitation\nSchmitt nevertheless offered his services as a legal advisor to the\nNazis. He was careful to emphasize that the Machtergreifung amounted\nto a true revolution, despite its seemingly legal form, to maintain\nconsistency with his view that a constitution cannot undergo\nfundamental change through formal amendment (SBV 5\u20139), but he\nwas quick to translate his identitarian theory of democracy into the\nracialist idiom preferred by the Nazis (SBV 32\u201346) and started\nto advocate an institutionalist theory of law that was supposed to\ntake its bearings from the authentic form of life of the German people\n(TJT 47\u201357, 89\u201395). Schmitt himself presented this shift\nas a fundamental reorientation of his legal-theoretical approach from\na \u2018decisionist\u2019 perspective to \u2018concrete order thought\u2019. It is\ndoubtful, however, whether the term \u2018concrete order\u2019 designates more\nthan the situation of normality that Schmitt had always taken to be\nthe basis of determinate legality. His claim (or hope) was simply that\nthe Nazis have successfully restored normality (but see Croce and\nSalvatore 2013, 11\u201376).  The national socialist movement, in\nSchmitt\u2019s view, had managed to orchestrate an exercise of constituent\npower and to create a new constitution; one that was willing to draw\nuncompromising distinctions between the German people and its internal\nand external enemies. Given this description of the\nMachtergreifung, Schmitt\u2019s political and constitutional\ntheory seems to imply that Hitler\u2019s rule was perfectly legitimate. It\ntherefore seems unnecessary to postulate a radical discontinuity\nbetween Schmitt\u2019s views before and after 1933 (Dyzenhaus 1997,\n82\u2013101; Mauss 1998; Scheuerman 1999, 113\u201339; Hofmann 2002,\n152\u201388).\n",
