    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\n\nLeibniz was born in Leipzig on July 1, 1646, two years prior to the\nend of the Thirty Years War, which had ravaged central Europe. His\nfamily was Lutheran and belonged to the educated elite on both sides:\nhis father, Friedrich Leibniz, was a jurist and professor of Moral\nPhilosophy at the University of Leipzig, and his mother, Catharina\nSchmuck, the daughter of a professor of Law. Leibniz's father\ndied in 1652, and his subsequent education was directed by his mother,\nuncle, and according to his own reports, himself. He was given access\nto his father's extensive library at a young age and proceeded to\npore over its contents, particularly the volumes of ancient history and\nthe Church Fathers.\n\n\nIn 1661 Leibniz began his formal university education at the\nUniversity of Leipzig. As the \u201cmodern\u201d philosophy of\nDescartes, Galileo, Gassendi, Hobbes and others had not made a great\nimpact by this time in the German-speaking lands, Leibniz's\nphilosophical education was chiefly Scholastic in its nature, though\nhe was also exposed to elements of Renaissance humanism.  While in\nLeipzig, Leibniz met Jacob Thomasius, who would have an important\ninfluence on Leibniz and who supervised Leibniz's first philosophical\ntreatise On the Principle of Individuation (De principio\nindividui). It was Thomasius more than anyone else perhaps who\ninstilled in Leibniz a great respect for ancient and medieval\nphilosophy. Indeed, one of the leitmotifs of Leibniz's philosophical\ncareer is his desire to reconcile the modern philosophy with the\nphilosophy of Aristotle, Plato, the Scholastics and the Renaissance\nhumanist tradition. After receiving his baccalaureate from Leipzig, he\ncontinued his studies at the University of Altdorf. While there\nLeibniz published in 1666 the remarkably original Dissertation on\nthe Art of Combinations (Dissertatio de arte\ncombinatoria), a work that sketched a plan for a \u201cuniversal\ncharacteristic\u201d and logical calculus, a subject that would\noccupy him for much of the rest of his life.  Although Leibniz was\noffered a position on the faculty of Law upon the completion of his\nDoctorate of Law in 1667, he had a different future in mind.\n\n\nIn that year, Leibniz met Baron Johann Christian von Boineburg,\na Protestant convert to Catholicism, who was able to secure a position\nfor Leibniz with the Elector of Mainz. While in the court of the\nElector, Leibniz composed a series of works in philosophical theology,\nthe Catholic Demonstrations, which are another manifestation\nof Leibniz's lifelong irenicism: in this case, in their attempt\nto provide a basis and justification for the reconciliation of\nProtestantism and Catholicism. Leibniz also turned his mind to natural\nphilosophy, having finally been able to study some of the works of the\nmoderns; the result was a two-part treatise in 1671, the New\nPhysical Hypothesis (Hypothesis physica nova). The first\npart, the Theory of Abstract Motion (Theoria motus\nabstracti), was dedicated to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de\nParis, and the second part, the Theory of Concrete Motion\n(Theoria motus concreti), was dedicated to the Royal Society\nin London. These works, however, were not likely to impress their\naudiences, for, given his circumstances, Leibniz could not but produce\namateurish works in the field.\n\n\nThis changed, however, in 1672, when Leibniz was given the single\nmost important opportunity of his life: the Elector of Mainz sent him\non a diplomatic mission to Paris, the center of learning and science at\nthe time. Leibniz was able to stay in Paris for four years (with a\nbrief trip to London in 1673), during which time he met many of the\n major figures of the intellectual world, among them \n Antoine Arnauld,\n Nicholas Malebranche, \n and,\n most important, the Dutch mathematician and physicist, \n Christiaan Huygens. \n It was he, \u201cthe great Huygenius\u201d (as John Locke would\ncall him in the Dedicatory Epistle to his Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding), who took Leibniz under his wing and tutored him\nin the developments in philosophy, physics, and mathematics. Not only\nwas Leibniz able to converse with some of the greatest minds of the\nseventeenth century while in Paris, he was also given access to the\nunpublished manuscripts of Descartes and Pascal. And, according to\nLeibniz, it was while reading the mathematical manuscripts of Pascal\nthat he began to conceive what would eventually become his\ndifferential calculus and his work on infinite series. In this time,\nLeibniz also designed a calculating machine able to perform addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, and division (see the Other Internet\nResources for a picture).  And his trip to London in 1673 was meant in\npart to present his designs to the Royal Society.\n\n\nWhile Leibniz was living the life of the mind in Paris, his employer\ndied, and Leibniz was thus forced to look for another position. He\neventually found one as the librarian for Duke Johann Friedrich of\nBrunswick, who ruled in Hanover. On the way to Hanover, Leibniz stopped\nin Amsterdam to meet with Spinoza between November 18 and\n21, 1676, three months before the latter's death;\naccording to Leibniz's own notes, they spoke of Spinoza's\nyet-to-be-published Ethics, Cartesian physics, and\nLeibniz's improved version of the ontological argument (see\nbelow). Although Leibniz would travel to Italy for a time in the late\n1680s in order to conduct historical research for the House of Hanover\nand make many shorter trips (including to Vienna), the rest of his life\nwas essentially spent in Hanover and its environs, working in different\ncapacities for the court, first, for Johann Friedrich until his death\nin 1680, then for Johann Friedrich's brother, Ernst August (from\n1680 to 1698), and finally for the latter's son, Georg Ludwig,\nwho in 1714 would become George I of England. Leibniz's relations\nwith Ernst August and Georg Ludwig were not as amicable as his\nrelations with his original employer, but he was close to Sophie, the\nwife of Ernst August and youngest sister of Princess Elisabeth of\nBohemia, with whom Descartes had an important philosophical\ncorrespondence. (Sophie was also the daughter of Elizabeth Stuart, and\nit is for this reason that her son became King of England.)\n\n\nWhile Leibniz may have felt physically isolated from the\nintellectual scene of Europe, he did manage to stay connected through a\nvast network of correspondents. (Leibniz exchanged letters with over\n1100 different people in the course of his life.) Despite the great\ndemands placed on Leibniz as librarian, then historian, and Privy\nCouncillor at the court of Hanover, he was able to complete work that,\nin its breadth, depth, and sheer quantity, is staggering.\n\n\nLeibniz's final years were bleak. He was engaged in a\nvituperative debate with Newton and his followers over the priority of\nthe discovery of the calculus, even being accused of stealing\nNewton's ideas. (Most historians of mathematics now claim that\nNewton and Leibniz developed their ideas independently: Newton\ndeveloping the ideas first with Leibniz the first to publish.) And at\nthe court he was mocked for his wig and old-fashioned clothing (think\n1670s Paris!). When Georg became George, the acrimony surrounding\nLeibniz in England was so great that Leibniz was asked to remain in\nHanover rather than follow his employer to London. Leibniz died\nNovember 14, 1716.\n",
