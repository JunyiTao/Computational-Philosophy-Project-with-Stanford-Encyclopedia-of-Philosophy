    "main_text": "Fundamental Themes in Feminist Legal Philosophy || Reasonableness in Law\n1.3 Reasonableness in Law\n\nLegal standards of reasonableness are another area where feminist\nphilosophers of law strive to reveal male norms. In areas of the law\nfrom criminal law (would a reasonable person believe that the threat\nof harm was sufficient to require the use of force in self-defense?)\nto tort law (did the defendant exercise reasonable care?) to contract\nlaw (what are reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing?) to\nemployment discrimination (was she reasonably offended by the conduct\nof others at work?), reasonableness standards play a major role in\nlaw. Traditionally, the standard was that of the average reasonable\nman, a formulation that overtly indicated its gendered nature. Today,\nthe standard is more likely to be formulated as that of a reasonable\nperson, but feminists continue to demonstrate how this standard\nreflects male norms. A particular area of current controversy is\ninteractions with the police, where feminists join with many others\nsuch as the Black Lives Matter movement or disability rights groups to\nreveal the biases in what is judged reasonable for police to do and\nwhat responses to police conduct are thought to be reasonable (Cuevas\nand Jacobi 2016). Feminists have also proposed the standard of an\naverage reasonable woman, which achieved one success in court,\n Ellison v. Brady,\n 924 F.2d 872 (9th Cir. 1991). However, the presence of a\nseparate legal standard may be criticized as unfair or as fragmenting\nthe law into a variety of subjective perspectives\u2014although this\nconclusion is also subject to critique as an illustration of the\ndifference dilemma. More recent feminist attention has been directed\ntowards de-legitimating masculinist perspectives of reasonableness and\nachieving equality in the understanding of reasonableness (Chamallas\n2010). Areas of law such as tort (Chamallas and Wriggins 2010) and\ncontract (Threedy 2010) have been reassessed as reflecting bias in\ntheir structure, the types of claims they recognize, their\nunderstanding of injury, and the compensation they provide. To\nsummarize, a persistent theme in feminist philosophy of law is\nuncovering how masculinist, ableist, or white norms are reflected in\nlaw.\n",
