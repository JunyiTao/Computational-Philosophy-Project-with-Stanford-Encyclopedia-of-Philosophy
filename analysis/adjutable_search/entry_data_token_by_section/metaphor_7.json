    "main_text": "Four Traditions || Brute Force Accounts\n4.4 Brute Force Accounts\n\nBrute Force Accounts maintain that in metaphor, no words go\nmissing and neither words nor speakers are induced to mean anything\nout of the ordinary. Instead, an utterance that would otherwise be\nidle or pointless produces something Richard Moran calls a\n\u201cframing effect\u201d(Moran, 1989): listeners are induced to\nview or consider or experience the primary subject (or subjects) in a\nfresh and special light, a light afforded by juxtaposing it (or them)\nwith the secondary subject (or subjects). What makes a remark\nmetaphorical is the fact that it induces this framing\neffect\u2014together, perhaps, with the specific syntactic strategy\nit employs for getting the job done. Paraphrase (so-called) is best\nviewed as an effort to provide a salient and representative sample of\nthe real or apparent truths about the primary subject(s) the framing\neffect induces us to notice, think about, or dwell upon. It\nmustn\u2019t be viewed as a restatement of some metaphorically\nexpressed or metaphorically conveyed message, since there is no such\nmessage, restatable or otherwise. As Donald Davidson put it in the\nmost influential statement of such an account, \u201cWhat Metaphors\nMean\u201d:\n\nWhen we try to say what a metaphor \u201cmeans,\u201d we soon\nrealize there is no end to what we want to mention\u2026 How many\nfacts are conveyed by a photograph? None, an infinity, or one great\nunstatable fact? Bad question. A picture is not worth a thousand\nwords, or any other number. Words are the wrong currency to exchange\nfor a picture. (Davidson 1978, 46\u20137)\n\n\nDavidson cheerfully admits that there are things we can naturally and\nusefully refer to as metaphorical meaning and metaphorical truth. But\nthey aren\u2019t the seeds of metaphorical understanding; they are\namong its fruits. We mislocate metaphorical meanings if we regard them\nas accruing to particular words or phrases, the words and phrases we\ntake metaphorically. And we mislocate metaphorical truth if we think\nof it as accruing to particular sentences, the ones we take to be\nmetaphors.\n\nWhen it comes to metaphorical meaning: metaphors are subject to\ninterpretation in much the same way or sense as dreams are. We may\ninterpret a dream with an eye to ascribing it a determinate cognitive\nvalue or interest, thereby coming to terms with it. Whether an\ninterpretation of a dream and the value or interest it ascribes to the\ndream in question can be made to stick depends as much on the nature\nof the interpreter and her concerns as on the nature of the dream and\nits origins. A successful dream interpretation is the successful\noutcome of a hermeneutic negotiation between an interpreter and a\ndream, or between an interpreter and a dreamer, where what counts as a\nsuccessful outcome depends on what both parties bring to the\ntransaction: \u201cMetaphor is the dreamwork of language, and, like\nall dreamwork, its interpretation reflects as much on the interpreter\nas on the originator.\u201d (31)\n\nWhen it comes to metaphorical truth: there can be truth (call it\nmetaphorical truth) in a sentence that is itself, considered simply as\na sentence, simply false, just as there can be truth (call it mythic\ntruth) in a story that is itself, considered simply as a story, simply\nfalse. Understood along these lines, metaphorical truth would be\nsomething like the revelatory power conferred upon a metaphorical\nsentence (or on the impulse to use such a sentence) by a successful\nmetaphorical interpretation of the sentence, a successful ascription\nto it of metaphorical meaning.\n\nDavidson\u2019s own version of a brute-force account has two main\npositive inspiring ideas.\n\nThe first is the analogy between metaphors and jokes, an analogy he\nmay have encountered originally in work of Ted Cohen (cf. Cohen 1978).\nMetaphors and jokes are alike in being small-scale works of verbal\nart. It takes wit to make jokes and a sense of humor to get them; it\ntakes genius of a certain sort to make metaphors and taste of a\ncertain sort to get them. All four capacities just mentioned are\ncreative capacities, modes of inventiveness\u2014inventive\nconstruction in the case of wit and genius, inventive construal in the\ncase of humor and taste. The acquisition of these capacities\nisn\u2019t simply a matter of assimilating rules, nor is their\nexercise simply a matter of applying rules. But capacities that are in\nthis sense creative or inventive are already at work in literal\nconstrual, even if they don\u2019t have such fancy names.\n\nWe get closer to the heart of Davidson\u2019s analogy if we contend\nthat metaphors (taken as metaphors) have meanings only in the same way\nor sense that jokes (taken as jokes) do: both metaphors and jokes have\npoints, points which will be got by some and missed by\nothers. The point of a joke or metaphor is based on and made possible\nby appropriate assignments of literal meanings to the words and\nphrases that go to make up an utterance\u2014based on and made\npossible by an appropriate literal construal of the\nutterance. Yet one may manage the called-for literal construal of a\njoke or metaphor yet nevertheless miss (fail to get) its point.\n\nThe point of a joke or metaphor is at once something more\nthan a second meaning or import, assigned in the course of a second\nact of construal, and something less than this. It is\nsomething more, in that producing a joke or metaphor in the first\nplace requires some kind and degree of artistic success: to produce a\njoke or metaphor at all is to bring something off. Getting (the point\nof) either kind of verbal contraption involves appreciating what the\nspeaker has brought off in producing it. And no amount of intellectual\nunderstanding of the speaker\u2019s ends, the\nspeaker\u2019s means, or the manner in which and extent to which the\nspeaker\u2019s means achieved the speaker\u2019s ends suffices for\nappreciation. Appreciation involves a capacity and readiness to\nexperience and value the finished contraption in ways called for by\nwhat its maker has brought off.\n\nThe second inspiring idea is an account of the framing effect itself,\non which it consists for the most part in a state of mind in which we\nare encouraged and enabled to make comparisons, encouraged and enabled\nto notice similarities and dissimilarities, analogies and\ndisanalogies, between primary and secondary subjects. Metaphor is\nconcerned with likenesses or analogies although it\ndoesn\u2019t state them.\n\nSometimes a brief but powerful poetic utterance consists solely of the\njuxtaposed mentionings of two different things or sights or\nsituations, managed so as to suggest that one of the two is there to\nshed light on the other. In Buson\u2019s haiku:\n\nA sudden chill\u2014\n\nin our room my dead wife\u2019s\n\ncomb, underfoot. (Stryk and Ikemoto, 1995, 50)\n\n\nthe light source, the chill, comes first. More commonly, as in\nPound\u2019s \u201cIn a Station of the Metro,\u201d it comes\nsecond. Critics often regard such poetic miniatures as limiting\ncases\u2014in a nonprejudicial sense, degenerate cases\u2014of\nmetaphor or simile. Northrop Frye (1957, 123) speaks of\n\u201cmetaphor by juxtaposition\u201d; he\u2019d have us regard\nPound\u2019s semicolon as the ghost of a departed metaphor-forging\nform of the verb to be:\n\nThese faces in the crowd are petals on a wet black bough.\n\n\nJohn Hollander (1985, 278) speaks of \u201cevaded simile\u201d;\nhe\u2019d have us regard the semicolon as the ghost of a departed\ncomparative construction:\n\nThese faces in the crowd are like petals on a wet black\nbough.\n\n\nDavidson\u2019s idea is the reverse of Frye\u2019s and\nHollander\u2019s: he\u2019d have us regard both the is of\nmetaphor and the is like of simile as lengthenings of\nPound\u2019s semicolon. What it is about A that lights up or\nis brought into prominence when A is considered in the light\nof B is what A shares or at least might be regarded\nas sharing with B, specific concrete real or putative\nlikenesses between A and B. For Davidson himself,\nthe framing effect is a cognitive affair; it consists in having\none\u2019s attention drawn to such real or putative likenesses. Not\nall advocates of a brute force account would agree with him about\nthis. (See for instance Rorty 1989, 17\u201318.)\n\nDavidson confronts semantic twist accounts like Skulsky\u2019s with\nthe following thought experiment:\n\n\nYou are entertaining a visitor from Saturn by trying to teach him the\nword \u201cfloor.\u201d You go through the familiar dodges, leading\nhim from floor to floor, pointing and stamping and repeating the\nword.\u2026\n\nShould we call this process learning something about the world or\nlearning something about language? An odd question, since what is\nlearned is that a bit of language refers to a bit of the world. Still,\nit is easy to distinguish between the business of learning the meaning\nof a word and using the word once the meaning is learned. Comparing\nthese two activities, it is natural to say that the first concerns\nlearning something about language, while the second concerns learning\nsomething about the world\u2026\n\nYour friend from Saturn now transports you through space to his home\nsphere, and looking back remotely on earth you say to him, nodding at\nthe earth, \u201cfloor.\u201d Perhaps he will think this is still\npart of the lesson and assume that the word \u201cfloor\u201d\napplies properly to the earth, at least as seen from Saturn. But what\nif you thought he already knew the meaning of \u201cfloor\u201d and\nyou were remembering how Dante, from a similar place in the heavens,\nsaw the inhabited earth as \u201cthe small round floor that makes us\npassionate\u201d? [Paradiso 22.151, trans. Laurence Binyon]\nYour purpose was metaphor, not drill in the use of the language. What\ndifference would it make to your friend which way he took it? With the\ntheory of metaphor under consideration, very little difference.\n(36\u20137)\n\n\nSemantic twist theory locates metaphor\u2019s specialness in a\nspecial kind of on-the-fly language learning. So it is committed to\nviewing metaphorical understanding as a process in which how we are\nalready disposed to experience, think about, and otherwise respond to\nthe primary and secondary subjects informs how we freshly\nexperience, think about, and respond to words such as\n\u201cfloor.\u201d A process in which what needs attending to,\nwhat needs active re-experiencing, is language, not the world.\nMetaphorical understanding, metaphorical language learning, would be\non all fours with respect to the prior and more drawn out business of\nlearning the literal meaning of \u201cfloor.\u201d But metaphorical\nunderstanding isn\u2019t like this at all. On the contrary, it is a\nprocess in which how we already experience, think about, and otherwise\nrespond to words such as \u201cfloor\u201d informs how we\nfreshly experience, think about, and respond to the primary and\nsecondary subjects. A process in which what needs attending to,\nwhat needs active re-experiencing, is the world, not language. Brute\nforce theory gets this exactly right; semantic twist theory gets it\nexactly wrong.\n\nRoger M. White (1996) agrees with Davidson about the comparison-based\nnature of the framing effect but rejects his juxtaposition-based\naccount of how metaphors deploy their syntactic raw material. On\nWhite\u2019s alternative brute force account, metaphor involves a\npair of recoverable parent sentences that have been intertwined or\ninterwoven to yield the sentence actually uttered; metaphor\u2019s\ncharacteristic effect on the listener requires the tacit\nreconstruction by him of those parent sentences, followed by an active\ncomparison of the differing situations those differing sentences would\nserve to describe. Metaphor still works by inducing a framing effect\nrather than by formulating or communicating any particular\npropositional content. But it is a whole situation, not a discrete\nobject or kind of object, that metaphor enables us to view in a new\nlight; the new light is shed by the invocation of a second situation\nof comparable complexity; and the invocation is managed by an\ninterweaving of sentences rather than by a juxtaposition of terms.\nSuch an account might be called conflationism. It\u2019s\nespecially appealing as an account of implicit metaphors such\nas Ahab\u2019s, and White employs it to offer close readings of\nambitious literary metaphors from Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, and\nothers.\n\nMore recently, Lepore and Stone (2010, 2015) have drawn on David\nLewis\u2019s work on convention, signaling, and conversational\nscorekeeping to offer a Davidson-inspired account of how speakers and\naudiences collaborate in bringing off the special verbal\naccomplishment that is a metaphor.\n\nIt won\u2019t be possible to analyze metaphor in terms of special\nspeaker meanings (in the manner of Grice) or special word meanings (in\nthe manner of Skulsky) unless the words of a metaphor are put to\nspecial nonstandard communicative use. Yet not all coordination with\nan audience by means of conventionally signaled intentions counts as\ncommunication with that audience. Say that a speaker S\ncoordinates with his audience in the joint achievement of goal\nG by means or utterance U when circumstances are\nsuch that:\n\n\n(a) S can motivate his listeners to collaborate with him in\nachieving G simply by getting them to think he intends that\nhe and they collaborate in achieving it;\n\n(b) Motivating his listeners in this manner pretty much exhausts the\ncontribution S himself needs to make to their joint\nachievement of G;\n\n(c) S can get his listeners to think he so intends simply by\nproducing something that will function under the circumstances as a\nconventional signal that he so intends, where conventional signal\nsystems are defined and explained along lines laid down in Lewis\n(1969);\n\n(d) Understandings already in place between S and his\nlisteners enable his production of U to function as just such\na conventional signal of just such an intention on his part; and\n\n(e) S in fact produces U.\n\n\nJoke-telling and metaphor-making certainly involve coordination with\nan audience so defined: coordination in a shared relishing of the\nridiculousness of some situation or attitude; coordination in a joint\nexploration of the ramifications of some pregnant comparison; or what\nhave you. But if we follow Lewis (1979), such coordination amounts to\ncommunication if and only if either\n\n\n(1) G simply consists in the addition of particular\npropositions to some public, jointly maintained conversational score\nor record; or at least,\n\n(2) all it would take to achieve G under the circumstances is\nsome such addition to some such conversational score or record.\n\n\nAnd the goals built into joke-telling and metaphor-making don\u2019t\nmeet this condition. No collaborative adjustment in what is taken for\ngranted for present conversational purposes suffices by itself to make\nit the case that we relish the ridiculousness of a situation together,\nexplore the ramifications of a comparison together, or what have you.\nSo metaphors and jokes are instances of non-communicative verbal\ncoordination: however much communication bringing off a metaphor or\njoke may often require, bringing off a metaphor or a joke is not in\nitself a communicative accomplishment. (The point has an interesting\nconsequence for theories of\n speech acts.\n Sometimes speakers collaborate with audiences on the production of a\nperlocutionary effect without collaborating with them on the\nproduction of any enabling illocutionary effect. Such brute\nperlocutionary acts include the bringing off of metaphors and jokes.\nWhen we tell a joke or propound a metaphor, we do something\nby speaking as we do without doing anything in\nspeaking as we do.)\n\nImportant details of Davidson\u2019s own views about metaphor are\nprovided in Davidson (1986) and (2005). For detailed critical\ncommentary see Reimer (1996, 2001, 2004), Reimer and Camp (2008), and\nCamp (2013). For much more on metaphors, jokes, and human intimacy see\nCohen (1978, 2008).\n",
