    "main_text": "Omission || Intentional Omissions and the Causal Theory of Action\n8. Animal Action\n\nFrom the start, our focus has been on the intentional actions of fully\ndeveloped rational agents. However, this raises the question: what\nabout other beings, such as (non-human) animals? Can they act? If so,\ndo they act in the same way as fully developed humans do? (Similar\nquestions arise for children and robots, but our focus shall be on the\ngrowing literature on animal agency.)\n\nAt first sight, the question may seem uninteresting: Of course,\nanimals can act! This seems to be a core commitment of our linguistic\npractices regarding animals, as we can truthfully assert claims like\nthe following:\n\n(17)\nThe cat is stealthily approaching the tree in order to hunt the\nbird.\n(18)\nCanela (a dog) wants you to give her a cookie\u2014that\u2019s\nwhy she is following you around.\n(19)\nThe squirrel is digging in the yard because it thinks there are\nnuts there.\n\n\nThese sentences seem to attribute to animals the capacity to take\nmeans for remote ends, the capacity to desire objects and act in\npursuit of these desires, and the capacity to employ their thoughts\nabout their surroundings in the service of such pursuits. Unless we\nare skeptics about the folk-psychological concepts involved in these\nascriptions, then, we should hold that animals are agents (but see\nGodfrey-Smith 2003, who holds that these folk concepts may be\nparticularly problematic when applied to animals). It is not\nsurprising, then, that Aristotle defined animal life in terms of the\ncapacity for a type of action, movement in place (DA 432a),\nor that Kant attributes a faculty of desire to all animals, through\nwhich they actualize their representations (KpV9).\n\nDespite all this, even Aristotle hedges on the ascription of action to\nanimals: although he grants that they are capable of voluntary\n(hekusion) action (DMA 11, 703b2 et passim;\nNE 3.1, 1111a), he also says that only mature human beings\nare capable of action proper (praxis) (NE 3.1,\n1111b). This is because action proper requires the capacity for\ndeliberation, which animals lack. A modern version of this view is\ndefended by Stoecker (2009), who argues that agency presupposes the\ncapacity to act on the basis of \u201darguments\u201c understood as\ngrounds on which one might (reasonably) act. Similar reasons for\nskepticism about animal agency were influentially advanced by Davidson\n(1982; 2003). For, as we saw, Davidson takes it that intentional\naction is action for a reason; but acting for a reason requires\npossession of beliefs. Yet, Davidson held that ascription of belief\nmakes sense only to beings who possess the concept of belief, which in\nturn requires the capacity for higher-order thought. Since Davidson\nassumed that animals possess neither concepts nor the capacity for\nhigher-order thought, he concluded that animals are not capable of\nintentional action. (Davidson, to our knowledge, does not address the\nquestion whether animals are capable of acting simpliciter. However,\nhe seems committed to saying that animals cannot act at all, given\nthat he defines actions in terms of intentional actions: for him an\naction is an event that is intentional under a certain description,\nsee Davidson 1971).\n\nWe can abstract from these considerations a more general form of\nargument for skepticism about animal agency, captured by the following\nschema:\n\nIf A acts, A must possess features \\(F_1, F_2,\n\\ldots , F_n\\). [Presuppositions for Agency Requirement]\nAnimals don\u2019t possess \\(F_1, F_2, \\ldots ,\nF_n\\). [Presuppositions Animals Lack]\nTherefore, animals do not act.\n\n\nThis schema is useful as a way to categorize sources of skepticism\nabout animal agency, and different responses offered in the\nliterature, depending on which premises are called into question.\n\nA prominent way of criticizing the argument is to call premise 1 into\nquestion. For example, Steward (2009) criticizes Davidson\u2019s view\nthat agency requires the capacity to act for reasons (Premise 1 in\nDavidson\u2019s argument). Her objection is based on empirical\nresearch suggesting that agency ascriptions are developmentally prior\nto propositional attitude ascriptions. She argues that implicit in\nthese earlier ascriptions is a less demanding account of agency that\npresupposes more basic object-directed attitudes (as well as other\ncapacities, such as subjectivity and agential control). Since animals\npossess these features, there is an important sense in which they act.\nOther arguments in a similar vein include Dretske\u2019s (1999)\nargument to the effect that agency presupposes only the capacity for\nrepresenting the world (understood, roughly, as a learned response\nwhose operations are shaped by the environment through experience),\nand the idea defended by Korsgaard (2018), Sebo (2017), and Schapiro\n(2021) that animals act on the basis of simpler, perceptual-like,\nrepresentations.\n\nOther scholars grant the basic links between agency and reasons or\nmeans-ends reasoning but question further presuppositions of the\nargument. For example, some scholars grant that actions must be done\nfor a reason, but hold that (some) animals meet this condition, since\nthey are capable of having non-conceptual thoughts (Hurley 2003); they\ncan engage in certain forms of inference in virtue of a non-linguistic\nsensitivity to inferential relations; and at least some of them (like\nchimpanzees) manifest a distinctive kind of sensitivity to reasons\nthat doesn\u2019t presuppose higher-order thought (Glock 2009; Arruda\nand Povinelli 2016). Using a similar strategy, Camp and Shupe (2017)\ngrant that action presupposes the capacity to distinctively represent\nmeans and ends but argue that the features presupposed by such a\ncapacity are more minimal than skeptics about animal agency assume:\nfor example, they may include metacognitive resources that keep track\nof a state without representing it as such.\n\nFinally, there are scholars who argue\u2014largely based on empirical\nfindings\u2014against premise 2 on the grounds that animals possess\nthe very capacities denied by skeptics of animal agency. For example,\nKaufmann (2015) argues that chimpanzees are capable of a fairly\nsophisticated form of planning that meets the constraints of\nBratman\u2019s account of planning agency. They are thus capable of\nacting, even though they lack conceptual representations. The question\nwhether some animals (and, if so, which) have beliefs has also been\nthe subject of debate on the basis of empirical research. While both\nearly and recent studies appeared to support the Davidsonian view that\nanimals lack beliefs (Heyes and Dickinson 1990; Marticorena et al.\n2011, Horschler, MacLean, and Santos 2020;), later research\ncomplicates the question (de Waal 2016; Krupenye et al. 2016).\n\nThus far, we have examined ways in which defenders of animal agency\ncan play defense, by criticizing different parts of the argument for\nanimal skepticism. When playing offense, defenders of animal agency\ncommonly appeal to our common ways of speaking and thinking about\nanimals, which, as noted, provide prima facie good grounds to ascribe\nthem agency. In addition, it has been noted that the heightened\nconditions on agency commonly used to exclude animals would have\ncounterintuitive effects for human actions. After all, many\nof our human intentional actions (such as habitual actions) do not\nseem to involve higher-order thought, or previous deliberation (a key\ninsight that leads Hyman 2015 to distinguish different senses of\n\u201dacting\u2019).\n\nMoreover, several authors grant that full-fledged intentional human\naction is special, but argue that we must recognize a more basic form\nof agency for animals. (This appears to be the view favoured by\nAnscombe (1957), who held that animals could act intentionally,\nalthough not in the language-dependent way that humans could, where we\ncan draw a significant distinction between the action itself and an\nexpression of intention. See Gustafsson 2016; Marcus 2021). The need\nto recognize a more basic form of agency can be motivated by noting\nthat otherwise the development of full-fledged human agency becomes\ndevelopmentally mysterious, both at the inter- and intra-species\nlevel. Thus, unless we can ascribe agency to non-rational animals, it\nwill be hard to explain how rational capacities might emerge in humans\nat the evolutionary level; and unless we ascribe agency to human\ninfants, it will be hard to explain how conceptual capacities emerge\n(Cussins 1992; MacIntyre 1999; Lovibond 2006; Steward 2009; Fridland\n2013).\n\nIn light of all these considerations, animal agency skepticism is\nnowadays a moribund view, with few defenders. However, even granting\nthat animals are agents, important questions remain about the nature\nof this agency, and its connection to intentional or rational agency.\nIndeed, as scholars continue to investigate the topic in an\nempirically informed way, we may need to draw further distinctions to\ncapture the richness of the forms of agency that are manifested across\ndifferent species and stages of development in the animal kingdom.\n",
