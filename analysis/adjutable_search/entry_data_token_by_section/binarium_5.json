Conceptual issues\n\n\nThus, although Gilson and some other twentieth-century scholars have\npaired the theories of universal hylomorphism and plurality of forms\nunder the title \u201cbinarium famosissimum,\u201d and although it is\ncertainly true that many medieval authors held both theories, there is\nno evidence that in medieval times they were ever thought of as a\n\u201cpair\u201d in this way.\n\n\nWhy then have some recent scholars linked the two theories so\nclosely? They certainly have done so. Weisheipl ([1980], p. 243), for\nexample, describes the plurality of forms as \u201csimply a logical\nconsequence of\u201d universal hylomorphism. And Zavalloni ([1951], p. 437,\nn. 61) likewise claims that universal hylomorphism necessarily implies\nplurality of forms, although he says the latter does not imply the\n former.[24]\n\n\nWhat may be going on is this. The theory of universal hylomorphism\nclosely fits the view that the structure of what we truly say about\nthings mirrors the structure of the things themselves. Thus, if I truly\nsay \u2018The cat is black\u2019, then there is a cat that corresponds to the\nsubject term, and that cat is qualified by the quality blackness corresponding to the predicate term.\nWithout the blackness, the cat is to that extent indeterminate. It is\nthe addition of blackness that determines the cat to the particular\ncolor it has. In general then, the relation of subject to predicate in\na true affirmative judgment is the relation of what is at least\nrelatively indeterminate to what at least partially determines it. Now\nthe relation of something indeterminate to what determines it is a\nrelation of \u201cmatter\u201d to \n \u201cform.\u201d[25]\n Hence everything we can truly say about a subject reflects the fact\nthat the thing is composed of an indeterminate side and a determining\nelement\u2014of matter and form.  In short, hylomorphic composition\nis involved in anything we can make true affirmations\nabout\u2014thus, universal\n hylomorphism.[26]\n\n\nOf course, we can truly say many things about a given subject.  (E.g.,\n\u2018The cat is black\u2019, \u2018The cat is fat\u2019,\n\u2018The cat is asleep\u2019, etc.)  The predicates of all these\ntrue statements correspond to forms really inhering in the relatively\nindeterminate subject. Hence we can speak of a \u201cplurality of forms.\u201d\nBut the \u201cplurality of forms,\u201d in the sense in which our authors speak\nof it, refers to something more restricted, to the fact that we can\npredicate predicates of a given subject in a certain \u201cnested\u201d\norder. We can, for example, while taking about the very same cat,\nsay \u201cThis is a body\u201d (i.e., it is corporeal), \u201cThis body is alive\u201d\n(i.e., it is an organism), \u201cThis organism is sensate\u201d (i.e., it has\nsensation, it is an animal), \u201cThis animal is a cat,\u201d \u201cThis cat is\nblack,\u201d etc. Each such predication attributes a form to the\nunderlying, \u201cmaterial,\u201d indeterminate subject, and each such subject\nis in turn a composite of a form and a deeper, underlying\nmaterial subject. The picture we get then is the picture of some kind\nof primordial matter, corresponding to the bare \u2018this'\nof the first predication (\u201cThis is a body\u201d), to which is added a\nseries of forms one on top of the other in a certain order,\neach one limiting and narrowing down the preceding ones. The structure\nthat results is a kind of laminated structure, a metaphysical \u201conion\u201d\nwith several layers. On this picture, of course, substantial and\naccidental forms are both \u201clayers of the onion\u201d in exactly the same\nsense. The distinction between essential and accidental features of a\nthing would therefore have to be drawn in some other way.\n\n\nIf this reconstruction is more or less correct, then it is clear why\nuniversal hylomorphism and plurality of forms can be viewed as\nconceptually linked. Both fit nicely with the view that the structure\nof reality is accurately mirrored in true predication. Ibn Gabirol,\nwho held both theories, seems to have been thinking along\napproximately these lines. But some of the arguments cited above in\nfavor of plurality of forms show that at least that half of the \u201cpair\u201d\nwas sometimes held for entirely different reasons.\n\n\nBy contrast with the above reasoning, there is another view of\npredication, an \u201cAristotelian\u201d (and later, Thomistic) view that\nrejects this picture. On this view, true predication in language is\nnot a reliable guide to the metaphysical structure of what makes it\ntrue. One can truly describe a given subject in narrower and\nnarrower terms without there being any corresponding distinction of\nreal metaphysical components in what we are describing. We can, for\nexample, describe our cat as a body, as an organism, as an animal, and\nas in particular a cat, all the while referring to a single\nmetaphysical configuration, a particular combination (in this case) of\nmatter and a feline form. Calling it a body, an organism, an animal,\nbefore calling it a cat in no way reflects any sequence of\nmetaphysical distinctions in the entity itself. It is only when we\ncall it \u201cblack\u201d that we introduce a new entity into the structure, an\naccident. In short, on this alternative view, the structure\nof reality is not accurately mirrored in true predication, at\nleast not in any straightforward way. This view is not committed to\nany \u201cplurality\u201d of substantial forms, and is not committed to\nuniversal hylomorphism\n either.[27]\n",
