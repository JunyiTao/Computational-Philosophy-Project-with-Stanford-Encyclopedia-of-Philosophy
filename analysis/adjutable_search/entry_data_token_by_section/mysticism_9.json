    "main_text": "The Attributes of Mystical Experience || Paradoxicality\n3.3 Paradoxicality\n\nScholars of mysticism sometimes stress the alleged\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d nature of mystical experiences. Four senses of\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d are relevant. (1) According to its etymology,\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d refers to what is surprising or \u201ccontrary to\nexpectation.\u201d (2) Language can be intentionally\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d in using a logically improper form of words to\nconvey what is not intended to be logically absurd. This may be for\nrhetorical effect or because of difficulty in conveying a thought\nwithout resort to linguistic tricks. (3) A \u201cparadox\u201d can involve\nan unexpected logical contradiction, as in the \u201cLiar\nParadox.\u201d (4) \u201cParadoxicality\u201d may be an\nintended logical contradiction. Walter Stace sees this as a\nuniversal feature of mystical experiences (Stace 1960,\n212). \n\nInsofar as mystical experiences are out of the ordinary, and the\nunitive quality strange to most of us, reports of them may very well\nbe surprising or contrary to expectation. Hence, they may be\nparadoxical in sense (1). Reports of mystical experiences may be\nparadoxical also in sense (2) because at times mystical language\ndoes assume logically offensive forms when actual absurdity may\nnot be intended. Frits Staal argued that paradoxical mystical language\nhas been used systematically to make logically respectable claims\n(Staal 1975). However, paradox in this sense occurs less\nfrequently in first-hand reports of mystical experiences and more in\nsecond-order mystical systems of thought (Moore 1973).\n\nThere is no good reason for thinking that reports of mystical\nexperience must imply logical absurdity, as in (3) or (4). As noted\nabove, while there do occur forms of expression that are\ncontradictory, the contradiction is often removed by the device of\n\u201cunsaying\u201d or canceling out that propels the discourse into\na non-discursive realm.\n\nThe attempt to designate mystical experiences as paradoxical in senses\n(3) and (4) may result from being too eager to take logically deviant\nlanguage literally. For example, Zen Buddhists speak of\nreaching a state of mind beyond both thought and \u201cno-thought\u201d and\nperception and \u201cno-perception\u201d \u2014 i.e., having thoughts but\nnot projecting our conceptual distinctions onto reality, thereby\navoiding the fabrication of a false world of discrete\nobjects. Labeling mental activity ceases. No logical\nabsurdity infects this description. While mystics use much literal\nlanguage in describing their experiences (see Alston 1992,\n80\u2013102), the literality need not extend to paradox in senses (3)\nor (4).\n\nBut paradox is only natural in mystical discourse: mystics want to\naffirm something of the nature of what they experienced, but they must\nutilize language originally designed for phenomenal realities and\nso must then deny the ascriptions as not actually applicable. Thus,\nthe paradox of affirming something and then denying it is not\nirrational or nonsense. But we would need to have a mystical\nexperience to see why the features were affirmed and why they are\ndenied as not truly applicable.\n",
