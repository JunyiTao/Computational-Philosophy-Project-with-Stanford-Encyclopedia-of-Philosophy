Before and After Neurophilosophy\n\nHistorically, neuroscientific discoveries exerted little influence on\nthe details of materialist philosophies of mind. The\n\u201cneuroscientific milieu\u201d of the past half-century has made\nit harder for philosophers to adopt substantive dualisms about mind.\nBut even the \u201ctype-type\u201d or \u201ccentral state\u201d\nidentity theories that rose to brief prominence in the late 1950s\n(Place 1956; Smart 1959) drew upon few actual details of the emerging\nneurosciences. Recall the favorite early example of a psychoneural\nidentity claim: \u201cpain is identical to C-fiber firing\u201d. The\n\u201cC-fibers\u201d turned out to be related to only a single\naspect of pain transmission (Hardcastle 1997). Early identity\ntheorists did not emphasize psychoneural identity hypotheses. Their\n\u201cneuro\u201d terms were admittedly placeholders for concepts\nfrom future neuroscience. Their arguments and motivations were\nphilosophical, even if the ultimate justification of the program was\nheld to be empirical.\n\nThe apology offered by early identity theorists for ignoring\nscientific details was that the neuroscience at that time was too\nnascent to provide any plausible identities. But potential identities\nwere afoot. David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel\u2019s (1962)\nelectrophysiological demonstrations of the receptive field properties\nof visual neurons had been reported with great fanfare. Using their\ntechniques, neurophysiologists began discovering neurons throughout\nvisual cortex responsive to increasingly abstract features of visual\nstimuli: from edges to motion direction to colors to properties of\nfaces and hands. More notably, Donald Hebb had published The\nOrganization of Behavior (1949) more than a decade earlier. He\nhad offered detailed explanations of psychological phenomena in terms\nof neural mechanisms and anatomical circuits. His psychological\nexplananda included features of perception, learning, memory, and even\nemotional disorders. He offered these explanations as potential\nidentities. (See the Introduction to his 1949). One philosopher who\ndid take note of some available neuroscientific detail at the time was\nBarbara Von Eckardt Klein (Von Eckardt Klein 1975). She discussed the\nidentity theory with respect to sensations of touch and pressure, and\nincorporated then-current hypotheses about neural coding of sensation\nmodality, intensity, duration, and location as theorized by\nMountcastle, Libet, and Jasper. Yet she was a glaring exception. By\nand large, available neuroscience at the time was ignored by both\nphilosophical friends and foes of early identity theories.\n\nPhilosophical indifference to neuroscientific detail became\n\u201cprincipled\u201d with the rise and prominence of functionalism\nin the 1970s. The functionalists\u2019 favorite argument was based on\nmultiple realizability: a given mental state or event can be realized\nin a wide variety of physical types (Putnam 1967; Fodor 1974).\nConsequently, a detailed understanding of one type of realizing\nphysical system (e.g., brains) will not shed light on the fundamental\nnature of mind. Psychology is thus autonomous from any science of one\nof its possible physical realizers (see the\n entry on multiple realizability\n in this Encyclopedia). Instead of neuroscience, scientifically-minded\nphilosophers influenced by functionalism sought evidence and\ninspiration from cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence.\nThese disciplines abstract away from underlying physical mechanisms\nand emphasize the \u201cinformation-bearing\u201d properties and\ncapacities of representations (Haugeland 1985). At this same time,\nhowever, neuroscience was delving directly into cognition, especially\nlearning and memory. For example, Eric Kandel (1976) proposed\npresynaptic mechanisms governing transmitter release rate as a\ncell-biological explanation of simple forms of associative learning.\nWith Robert Hawkins (Hawkins and Kandel 1984) he demonstrated how\ncognitivist aspects of associative learning (e.g., blocking,\nsecond-order conditioning, overshadowing) could be explained\ncell-biologically by sequences and combinations of these basic forms\nimplemented in higher neural anatomies. Working on the post-synaptic\nside, neuroscientists began unraveling the cellular mechanisms of long\nterm potentiation (LTP; Bliss and Lomo 1973). Physiological\npsychologists quickly noted its explanatory potential for various\nforms of learning and\n memory.[1]\n Yet few \u201cmaterialist\u201d philosophers paid any attention.\nWhy should they? Most were convinced functionalists. They believed\nthat the \u201cimplementation level\u201d details might be important\nto the clinician, but were irrelevant to the theorist of mind.\n\nA major turning point in philosophers\u2019 interest in neuroscience\ncame with the publication of Patricia Churchland\u2019s\nNeurophilosophy (1986). The Churchlands (Patricia and Paul)\nwere already notorious for advocating eliminative materialism (see the\nnext section). In her (1986) book, Churchland distilled eliminativist\narguments of the past decade, unified the pieces of the philosophy of\nscience underlying them, and sandwiched the philosophy between a\nfive-chapter introduction to neuroscience and a 70-page chapter on\nthree then-current theories of brain function. She was unapologetic\nabout her intent. She was introducing philosophy of science to\nneuroscientists and neuroscience to philosophers. Nothing could be\nmore obvious, she insisted, than the relevance of empirical facts\nabout how the brain works to concerns in the philosophy of mind. Her\nterm for this interdisciplinary method was \u201cco-evolution\u201d\n(borrowed from biology). This method seeks resources and ideas from\nanywhere on the theory hierarchy above or below the question at issue.\nStanding on the shoulders of philosophers like Quine and Sellars,\nChurchland insisted that specifying some point where neuroscience ends\nand philosophy of science begins is hopeless because the boundaries\nare poorly defined. Neurophilosophers would pick and choose resources\nfrom both disciplines as they saw fit.\n\nThree themes predominated Churchland\u2019s philosophical discussion:\ndeveloping an alternative to the logical empiricist theory of\nintertheoretic reduction; responding to property-dualistic arguments\nbased on subjectivity and sensory qualia; and responding to\nanti-reductionist multiple realizability arguments. These projects\nremained central to neurophilosophy for more than a decade after\nChurchland\u2019s book appeared. John Bickle (1998) extended the\nprincipal insight of Clifford Hooker\u2019s (1981a,b,c)\npost-empiricist theory of intertheoretic reduction. He quantified key\nnotions using a model-theoretic account of theory structure adapted\nfrom the structuralist program in philosophy of science (Balzer,\nMoulines, and Sneed 1987). He also made explicit a form of argument to\ndraw ontological conclusions (cross-theoretic identities, revisions,\nor eliminations) from the nature of the intertheoretic reduction\nrelations obtaining in specific cases. For example, it is routinely\nconcluded that visible light, a theoretical posit of optics, is\nelectromagnetic radiation within specified wavelengths, a theoretical\nposit of electromagnetism; in this case, a cross-theoretic ontological\nidentity. It is also routine to conclude that phlogiston does not\nexist: an elimination of a kind from our scientific ontology. Bickle\nexplicated the nature of the reduction relation in a specific case\nusing a semi-formal account of \u201cintertheoretic\napproximation\u201d inspired by structuralist results.\n\nPaul Churchland (1996) carried on the attack on property-dualistic\narguments for the irreducibility of conscious experience and sensory\nqualia. He argued that acquiring some knowledge of existing sensory\nneuroscience increases one\u2019s ability to \u201cimagine\u201d or\n\u201cconceive of\u201d a comprehensive neurobiological explanation\nof consciousness. He defended this conclusion using a\ncharacteristically imaginative thought-experiment based on the history\nof optics and electromagnetism.\n\nFinally, criticisms of the multiple realizability argument\nflourish\u2014and are challenged\u2014to the present day. Although\nthe multiple realizability argument remains influential among\nnonreductive physicalists, it no longer commands the near-universal\nacceptance it once did. Replies to the multiple realizability argument\nbased on neuroscientific details have appeared. For example, William\nBechtel and Jennifer Mundale (1999) argue that neuroscientists use\npsychological criteria in brain mapping studies. This fact undercuts\nthe likelihood that psychological kinds are multiply realized (for a\nreview of recent developments see the\n entry on multiple realizability\n in this Encyclopedia).\n",
