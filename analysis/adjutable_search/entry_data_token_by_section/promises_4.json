Conventionalism\n\nConventionalism about promises refers, in the vaguest sense, to views\nthat invoke the promising convention (or the promising\n\u201cpractice\u201d, \u201cinstitution\u201d,\n\u201csystem\u201d, or \u201cgame\u201d to mention some of the\nother names that it goes by in the literature) as central to their\nexplanation of the provenance of promises and promissory\nobligations.\n\nThere are a number of different ways of making this idea more precise\nin the literature (E. Taylor 2013, Neiwenstadt 2019a, van Roojen 2020,\nCohon 2021, inter alia). My survey of this literature leads\nto me to propose a distinction between two sorts of conventionalism,\nontological and normative.\n",
