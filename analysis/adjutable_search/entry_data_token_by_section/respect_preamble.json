    "main_text": "\n\nRespect has great importance in everyday life. As children we are\ntaught (one hopes) to respect our parents and teachers, school rules\nand traffic laws, family and cultural traditions, other people\u2019s\nfeelings and rights, our country\u2019s flag and leaders, the truth\nand people\u2019s differing opinions. And we come to value respect\nfor such things; when we\u2019re older, we may shake our heads (or\nfists) at people who seem not to have learned to respect them. We\ndevelop great respect for people we consider exemplary and lose\nrespect for those we discover to be clay-footed; we may also come to\nbelieve that, at some level, all people are worthy of respect. We may\nlearn that jobs and relationships become unbearable if we receive no\nrespect in them; in certain social milieus we may learn the price of\ndisrespect if we violate the street law: \u201cDiss me, and you\ndie.\u201d Calls to respect this or that are increasingly part of\npublic life: environmentalists exhort us to respect nature, foes of\nabortion and capital punishment insist on respect for human life,\nmembers of racial and ethnic minorities and those discriminated\nagainst because of their gender, sexual orientation, age, religious\nbeliefs, or economic status demand respect both as social and moral\nequals and for their cultural differences. And it is widely\nacknowledged that public debates about such demands should take place\nunder terms of mutual respect. We may learn both that our lives\ntogether go better when we respect the things that deserve to be\nrespected and that we should respect some things independently of\nconsiderations of how our lives would go.\n\nWe may also learn that how our lives go depends every bit as much on\nwhether we respect ourselves. The value of self-respect may be\nsomething we can take for granted, or we may discover how very\nimportant it is when our self-respect is threatened, or we lose it and\nhave to work to regain it, or we have to struggle to develop or\nmaintain it in a hostile environment. Some people find that finally\nbeing able to respect themselves is what matters most about finally\nstanding on their own two feet, kicking a disgusting habit, or\ndefending something they value; others, sadly, discover that life is\nno longer worth living if self-respect is irretrievably lost. It is\npart of everyday wisdom that respect and self-respect are deeply\nconnected, that it is difficult both to respect others if we\ndon\u2019t respect ourselves and to respect ourselves if others\ndon\u2019t respect us. It is increasingly part of political wisdom\nboth that unjust social institutions can devastatingly damage\nself-respect and that robust and resilient self-respect can be a\npotent force in struggles against injustice.\n\nThe ubiquity and significance of respect and self-respect in everyday\nlife largely explains why philosophers, particularly in moral and\npolitical philosophy, have been interested in these two concepts. They\nturn up in a multiplicity of philosophical contexts, including\ndiscussions of justice and equality, injustice and oppression,\nautonomy and agency, moral and political rights and duties, moral\nmotivation and moral development, cultural diversity and toleration,\npunishment and political violence, and a host of applied ethics\ncontexts. Although a wide variety of things are said to deserve\nrespect, contemporary philosophical interest in respect has\noverwhelmingly been focused on respect for persons, the idea that all\npersons should be treated with respect simply because they are\npersons. This focus owes much to the 18th century German\nphilosopher, Immanuel Kant, who argued that all and only persons and\nthe moral law they autonomously legislate are appropriate objects of\nthe morally most significant attitude of respect. Although honor,\nesteem, and prudential regard played important roles in moral and\npolitical theories before him, Kant was the first major Western\nphilosopher to put respect for persons, including oneself, at the very\ncenter of moral theory, and his insistence that persons are ends in\nthemselves with an absolute dignity who must always be respected has\nbecome a core ideal of modern humanism and political liberalism. In\nrecent years many people have argued that moral respect ought also to\nbe extended to things other than persons, such as nonhuman living\nbeings and the natural environment.\n\nDespite the widespread acknowledgment of the importance of respect and\nself-respect in moral and political life and theory, there is no\nsettled agreement in either everyday thinking or philosophical\ndiscussion about such issues as how to understand the concepts, what\nthe appropriate objects of respect are, what is involved in respecting\nvarious objects, and what the scope is of any moral requirements\nregarding respect and self-respect. This entry will survey these and\nrelated issues.\n",
