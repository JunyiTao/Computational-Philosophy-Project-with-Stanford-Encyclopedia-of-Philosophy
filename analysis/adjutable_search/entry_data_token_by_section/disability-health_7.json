    "main_text": "Disability and Health || The First Approach: Distinguishing Disability from Disease\n2.1 The First Approach: Distinguishing Disability from Disease\n\nThe distinction between disease and disability has received\nsurprisingly little attention in the philosophical literature. Most\nstatutory and other official definitions either treat serious diseases\nas disabilities or make \u201cimpairment\u201d, \u201closs of\nfunction\u201d, or \u201cstructural/functional abnormality\u201d an\nelement of disability, leaving the relationship of disease to\ndisability unclear (e.g., Americans with Disabilities Act, 1990 or\nDisability Discrimination Act, 1995). One of the few detailed analyses\nof the relationship between disease and disability was offered by Ron\nAmundson, who proposed that disability should be understood as one of\nthe three general consequences of disease, along with pain and death\n(Amundson 1992: 105\u2013119). Amundson adopted Boorse\u2019s\nvalue-neutral account of health, but argued that Boorse defined\n\u201cdisease\u201d too broadly, as a \u201cdeviation from the\nfunctional organization of typical members of a species\u201d\u2014a\ndefinition which would encompass most disabilities. Amundson contended\nthat it was both clearer and closer to common usage to treat disease\nas an atypical process that tended to result in disability, pain, or\n death.[3]\n\nAmundson defined disability as the loss or deviation from a particular\nkind of species-typical function: action at the personal level, e.g.,\nthe inability to move one\u2019s arm, as opposed to the inability to\nmetabolize sugar. Disabilities that are not products of a process that\nleads to pain, death, or further impairment are not symptomatic of\ndisease in Amundson\u2019s sense. They are consistent with health\nnarrowly defined. Yet some philosophers (Hausman 2001: 254) find the\nnotion that individuals can be in excellent health if they are blind,\ndeaf, or paraplegic sufficiently implausible to count against analyses\nof health with that implication.\n\nThe disagreement between Amundson and Boorse on the distinction\nbetween disease and disability is not just a matter of semantics. The\ncritical point in Amundson\u2019s analysis is a practical one.\nMedical interventions are the presumptive response to disease; they\nseek to slow, arrest, or reverse processes that cause pain and may\nlead to physiological dysfunction, (further) disability (in\nAmundson\u2019s terms), or death. But on Amundson\u2019s view, which\nmakes disability consistent with health, the presumptive response to\ndisability need not be medical as opposed to environmental or social.\nFurthermore, the loss of opportunity associated with disabilities can\noften be prevented or mitigated more effectively and (in the long run)\nmore economically by modifying the physical and social environment\nthan by medical intervention. This is true even though environmental\nmeasures are likely to fare poorly against medical interventions in\nthe competition for scarce resources, because of the prestige and\nperceived importance of medical treatment. The failure to distinguish\ndisease and disability, and the tendency to favor a medical response\nfor both, reflects the sway of the medical model, and offers a clear\nillustration of how it differs from the social model (see\n SEP entry on disability: definitions, models, experience).\n\nRecently, Peter Hucklenbroich has proposed a harm-oriented account of\nhealth as the absence of a \u201cdisease\u201d process. Such a\nprocess is pathological in the sense that:\n\nit is immediately lethal or definitely life-shortening, [or]\nit is a condition of pain, suffering, or other specific\ncomplaints, [or]\nit is a condition of infertility (incapability of biological\nreproduction), [or]\nit is a condition of inability or impairment for living together\nin human symbiotic communities, [or]\nit is a non-universal disposition of the organism to develop a\ncondition that is pathological according to one or more of these\ncriteria.\n (12)[4]\n\n\nHucklenbroich\u2019s account defines health in terms of a list of\nreasonably health-specific harms and it restricts health to the\nabsence of biological conditions that either (a) directly\ninvolve harm or (b) dispose one to suffer harm.\n\nAn account along these lines may have the potential to distinguish\ndisease from disability so as to make the former immediately relevant\nto well-being in a way the latter is not. Unlike purely non-normative\naccounts, it only finds a health-decrement where something bad comes\nfrom the state of the body. Unlike capaciously normative accounts, it\ndefines these \u201cbads\u201d in terms of a general and\nhealth-specific harm; not just any body-based limitation on the\npursuit of our (potentially idiosyncratic) goals makes us unhealthy.\nAnd finally, defining health in terms of bodily dispositions\ncould help to explain why extrinsic factors, like those cited by\nsocial models of disability, are irrelevant to health. It could\ndistinguish between harms that come from social responses to the body\nfrom harms that come from the body itself; thereby distinguishing\nbetween harms that generate claims on health care and harms that\ngenerate claims against discrimination or the denial of fair equality\nof opportunity.\n\nDespite the importance of distinguishing disease from disability,\nthere are at least three reasons why it is difficult to do so. First,\nas noted above, many or most diseases are defined as disabilities by\ndisability discrimination laws or their judicial and administrative\ninterpretations; they are subject to the same legal protections and\nrequirements of reasonable accommodation as \u201cAmundsonian\u201d\ndisabilities. This legal treatment may, however, be justifiable,\nbecause some diseases, such as AIDS, are stigmatized as severely as\nmany or most disabilities. Second, many disabilities, such as the\ninability to walk, may be associated with diseases, such as MS, which\nhave a progressive character, causing pain and further impairment, and\nsometimes increasing the risk of death (Wendell 2001).[5]\n Third, a society such as our own, where atypical functionings are\noften not well accommodated, accords a higher priority to the\nprevention or treatment of some non-fatal diseases than would a\nsociety that better accommodated them.\n",
