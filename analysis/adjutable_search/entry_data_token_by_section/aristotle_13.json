    "main_text": "Living Beings\n11. Living Beings\n\n\nHowever these and like issues are to be resolved, given the primacy of\nform as substance, it is unsurprising to find Aristotle identifying\nthe soul, which he introduces as a principle or source\n(arch\u00ea) of all life, as the form of a living\ncompound. For Aristotle, in fact, all living things, and not only\nhuman beings, have souls: \u2018what is ensouled is distinguished\nfrom what is unensouled by living\u2019 (DA 431a20\u201322;\ncf. DA 412a13, 423a20\u20136; De Part. An.\n687a24\u2013690a10; Met. 1075a16\u201325).  It is\nappropriate, then, to treat all ensouled bodies in hylomorphic\nterms: \n\n\nThe soul is the cause and source of the living body. But\ncause and source are meant in many ways [or are\nhomonymous].   Similarly, the soul is a cause in accordance\nwith the ways delineated, which are three: it is (i) the cause as the\nsource of motion [=the efficient cause], (ii) that for the sake of\nwhich [=the final cause], and (iii) as the substance of ensouled\nbodies. That it is a cause as substance is clear, for substance\nis the cause of being for all things, and for living things, being is\nlife, and the soul is also the cause and source of life. (DA\n415b8\u201314; cf. PN 467b12\u201325, Phys. 255a56\u201310) \n\n\n\n\nSo, the soul and body are simply special cases of form and\nmatter:\n\n\nsoul\u2009:\u2009body :: form\u2009:\u2009matter ::\nactuality\u2009:\u2009potentiality\n\n\n\n\nFurther, the soul, as the end of the compound organism, is also the\nfinal cause of the body. Minimally, this is to be understood as the\nview that any given body is the body that it is because it is\norganized around a function which serves to unify the entire\norganism. In this sense, the body\u2019s unity derives from the fact it has\na single end, or single life directionality, a state of affairs that\nAristotle captures by characterizing the body as the sort of matter\nwhich is organic (organikon; DA 412a28). By\nthis he means that the body serves as a tool for implementing the\ncharacteristic life activities of the kind to which the organism\nbelongs (organon = tool in Greek).  Taking all this\ntogether, Aristotle offers the view that the soul is the \u2018first\nactuality of a natural organic body\u2019 (DA\n412b5\u20136), that it is a \u2018substance as form of a natural\nbody which has life in potentiality\u2019 (DA \n412a20\u20131) and, again, that it \u2018is a first actuality of a\nnatural body which has life in potentiality\u2019 (DA \n412a27\u20138).\n\n\nAristotle contends that his hylomorphism provides an attractive middle\nway between what he sees as the mirroring excesses of his\npredecessors. In one direction, he means to reject Presocratic kinds\nof materialism; in the other, he opposes Platonic dualism.  He gives\nthe Presocratics credit for identifying the material causes of life,\nbut then faults them for failing to grasp its formal cause.  By\ncontrast, Plato earns praise for grasping the formal cause of life;\nunfortunately, as Aristotle sees things, he then proceeds to neglect\nthe material cause, and comes to believe that the soul can exist\nwithout its material basis.  Hylomorphism, in Aristotle\u2019s view,\ncaptures what is right in both camps while eschewing the unwarranted\nmono-dimensionality of each. To account for living organisms,\nAristotle contends, the natural scientist must attend to both matter\nand form.\n\n\nAristotle deploys hylomorphic analyses not only to the whole organism,\nbut to the individual faculties of the soul as well. Perception\ninvolves the reception of sensible forms without matter, and thinking,\nby analogy, consists in the mind\u2019s being enformed by intelligible\nforms. With each of these extensions, Aristotle both expands and\ntaxes his basic hylomorphism, sometimes straining its basic framework\nalmost beyond recognition. \n\n\n           \nFor more detail on Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphism in psychological\nexplanation, see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s Psychology.\n",
