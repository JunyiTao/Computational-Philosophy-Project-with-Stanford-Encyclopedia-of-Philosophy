    "main_text": "Astronomical Ideas and Writings || The Commentariolus\n2.2 The Commentariolus\n\nIt is impossible to date when Copernicus first began to espouse the\nheliocentric theory. Had he done so during his lecture in Rome, such a\nradical theory would have occasioned comment, but there was none, so\nit is likely that he adopted this theory after 1500. Further,\nCorvinus, who helped him print his Latin translation in 1508\u201309,\nexpressed admiration for his knowledge of astronomy, so that\nCopernicus\u2019s concept may have still been traditional at this\npoint. His first heliocentric writing was his Commentariolus.\nIt was a small manuscript that was circulated but never printed. We do\nnot know when he wrote this, but a professor in Cracow cataloged his\nbooks in 1514 and made reference to a \u201cmanuscript of six leaves\nexpounding the theory of an author who asserts that the earth moves\nwhile the sun stands still\u201d (Rosen, 1971, 343; MW 75).\nThus, Copernicus probably adopted the heliocentric theory sometime\nbetween 1508 and 1514. Rosen (1971, 345) suggested that\nCopernicus\u2019s \u201cinterest in determining planetary positions\nin 1512\u20131514 may reasonably be linked with his decisions to\nleave his uncle\u2019s episcopal palace in 1510 and to build his own\noutdoor observatory in 1513.\u201d In other words, it was the result\nof a period of intense concentration on cosmology that was facilitated\nby his leaving his uncle and the attendant focus on church politics\nand medicine.\n\nIt is impossible to know exactly why Copernicus began to espouse the\nheliocentric cosmology. Despite his importance in the history of\nphilosophy, there is a paucity of primary sources on Copernicus. His\nonly astronomical writings were the Commentariolus, the\nLetter against Werner, and On the Revolutions; he\npublished his translation of Theophylactus\u2019s letters and wrote\nthe various versions of his treatise on coinage; other writings relate\nto diocesan business, as do most of the few letters that survive.\nSadly, the biography by Rheticus, which should have provided scholars\nwith an enormous amount of information, has been lost. Therefore, many\nof the answers to the most interesting questions about\nCopernicus\u2019s ideas and works have been the result of conjecture\nand inference, and we can only guess why Copernicus adopted the\nheliocentric system.\n\nMost scholars believe that the reason Copernicus rejected Ptolemaic\ncosmology was because of Ptolemy\u2019s\n equant.[5]\n They assume this because of what Copernicus wrote in the\nCommentariolus:\n\nYet the widespread [planetary theories], advanced by Ptolemy and most\nother [astronomers], although consistent with the numerical [data],\nseemed likewise to present no small difficulty. For these theories\nwere not adequate unless they also conceived certain equalizing\ncircles, which made the planet appear to move at all times with\nuniform velocity neither on its deferent sphere nor about its own\n[epicycle\u2019s] center\u2026Therefore, having become aware of\nthese [defects], I often considered whether there could perhaps be\nfound a more reasonable arrangement of circles, from which every\napparent irregularity would be derived while everything in itself\nwould move uniformly, as is required by the rule of perfect motion.\n(MW 81).\n\n\nGoddu (381\u201384) has plausibly maintained that while the initial\nmotivation for Copernicus was dissatisfaction with the equant, that\ndissatisfaction may have impelled him to observe other violations of\nuniform circular motion, and those observations, not the rejection of\nthe equant by itself, led to the heliocentric theory. Blumenberg (254)\nhas pointed out that the mobility of the earth may have been\nreinforced by the similarity of its spherical shape to those of the\nheavenly bodies.\n\nAs the rejection of the equant suggests a return to the Aristotelian\ndemand for true uniform circular motion of the heavenly bodies, it is\nunlikely that Copernicus adopted the heliocentric model because\nphilosophies popular among Renaissance humanists like Neoplatonism and\nHermetism compelled him in that\n direction.[6]\n Nor should we attribute Copernicus\u2019s desire for uniform\ncircular motions to an aesthetic need, for this idea was philosophical\nnot aesthetic, and Copernicus\u2019s replacing the equant with\nepicyclets made his system more complex than Ptolemy\u2019s. Most\nimportantly, we should bear in mind what Swerdlow and Neugebauer (59)\nasserted:\n\nCopernicus arrived at the heliocentric theory by a careful analysis of\nplanetary models \u2013 and as far as is known, he was the only\nperson of his age to do so \u2013 and if he chose to adopt it, he did\nso on the basis of an equally careful analysis.\n\n\nIn the Commentariolus Copernicus listed assumptions that he\nbelieved solved the problems of ancient astronomy. Bardi has suggested\nthat these assumptions are non-Euclidean axioms. Copernicus stated\nthat the earth is only the center of gravity and center of the\nmoon\u2019s orbit; that all the spheres encircle the sun, which is\nclose to the center of the universe; that the universe is much larger\nthan previously assumed, and the earth\u2019s distance to the sun is\na small fraction of the size of the universe; that the apparent motion\nof the heavens and the sun is created by the motion of the earth; and\nthat the apparent retrograde motion of the planets is created by the\nearth\u2019s motion. Although the Copernican model maintained\nepicycles moving along the deferrent, which explained retrograde\nmotion in the Ptolemaic model, Copernicus correctly explained that the\nretrograde motion of the planets was only apparent not real, and its\nappearance was due to the fact that the observers were not at rest in\nthe center. The work dealt very briefly with the order of the planets\n(Mercury, Venus, earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the only planets\nthat could be observed with the naked eye), the triple motion of the\nearth (the daily rotation, the annual revolution of its center, and\nthe annual revolution of its inclination) that causes the sun to seem\nto be in motion, the motions of the equinoxes, the revolution of the\nmoon around the earth, and the revolution of the five planets around\nthe sun.\n",
