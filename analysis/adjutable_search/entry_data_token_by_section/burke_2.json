    "main_text": "Intellectual orientation\n3. Intellectual orientation\n Burke\u2019s mind, by the time he left Trinity, had two features of\nespecial interest: one was an orientation towards religion,\nimprovement and politics, the other a philosophical method. The latter\nderived from his university education, the former from reflection on\nthe Irish situation. Burke was born into an Ireland where reflective\nintellect had its social setting in a small educational elite, much of\nit connected with the Church of Ireland. This elite contemplated a\npolitical class which owned much of the land, and consisted primarily\nof a gentry and peerage, headed by the King\u2019s representative, the\nLord-Lieutenant; but it saw too a tiny professional class, and a huge,\nilliterate, impoverished peasantry. The aim of the educational elite,\nwhich it shared with some of the political class, was improvement in\nthe broadest sense, that is to say it connected self-improvement\nthrough the influence of the arts & sciences, and through the\ndevelopment of intellectual skills, with moral culture and with\neconomic development. The ability of the educated, the politicians and\nthe rich to take constructive initiatives contrasted starkly with the\ninability of the peasantry to help itself: peasants relieved their\nmisery principally through spasms of \u2018savagery\u2019 against\ntheir landlords\u2019 representatives, but such violence was repressed\nsternly and helped nobody. (For Burke, \u2018savagery\u2019 refers\nto any conduct that falls below certain standards.) The Irish\nsituation suggested a general rationale of practice to those who\nwished to improve themselves and others: improvement, if it was to\nspread outside the educational elite, must spring from the guidance\nand good will of the possessing classes: from the landlord who\ndeveloped his property, from the priest who instructed and consoled\nthe poor, and from the lord lieutenant who used his power\nbenevolently. The only obvious alternative was the use of\nforce\u2014and that was both destructive and fruitless. Burke\nretained all his life a sense of the responsibility of the educated,\nrich and powerful to improve the lot of those whom they directed; a\nsense that existing arrangements were valuable insofar as they were\nthe necessary preconditions for improvement; and a strong sense of the\nimportance of educated people as agents for constructive change,\nchange which he often contrasted with the use of force, whether as\nmethod or as result.  This experiental orientation of\nBurke\u2019s mind was turned from attitude into articulate thought\nthrough the educational medium of the Irish Enlightenment. For\nexample, some points that may seem distinctively Burkean belonged\nfirst to Berkeley. Berkeley saw no advantages in improper abstraction\nor in a mythical golden age. Burke\u2019s unwillingness to judge\ninstitutions and practices without first connecting them with other\nthings, his disinclination \u2018to give praise or blame to any thing\nwhich relates to human actions, and human concerns, on a simple view\nof the object in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical\nabstraction\u2019 (RRF, W & S 1981\u20132015, viii.58), is a\npractical judgement that implies a conceptual counterpart like\nBerkeley\u2019s view that \u2018when we attempt to abstract\nextension and motion from all other qualities, and consider them by\nthemselves, we presently lose sight of them, and run into great\nextravagancies\u2019 (Berkeley, Principles of Human\nKnowledge [1948\u201357, vol. ii, 84].) In both cases,\nphilosophical wariness matched a distaste for considering aspects of\nobjects in permanent isolation from the other aspects with which they\nwere essentially connected. This suspicion of abstract ideas\naccompanied a suspicion of schemes for considering people in\nabstraction from their present situation, and accompanied too doubts\nabout a golden past: Berkeley rejected \u2018the rude original of\nsociety\u2019 (Berkeley, The Querist [1948\u201357,\nvol. vi, 141]) and had no time for \u2018declaimers against\nprejudice\u2019 who \u2018have wrought themselves into a sort of\nesteem for savages, as a virtuous and unprejudiced people\u2019\n(Berkeley, Discourse addressed to Magistrates [1948\u201357,\nvol. vi, 206]), and it need not be emphasized that Burke shared such\nviews. Both belonged to an elite which considered improvement to be\nnecessary, and sought to make it through the agencies in church, state\nand education that were really available at the time. Above all, they\nshared an intellectual temper: they sought to see things how they are,\nwith an eye to bettering the condition of society.  But Burke was not\nBerkeley, and though their similarities indicate a shared\nphilosophical orientation, Burke had his own way of developing it. To\nindividuate him, we must turn to what he acquired from the Trinity\nsyllabus, and how he used his acquisitions.  This syllabus, by\nthe time Burke became an undergraduate student at the age of fifteen\n(1744), not only gave attention to Aristotelian manuals but also to\n\u2018the way of ideas\u2019 enshrined in Locke\u2019s Essay\nconcerning Human Understanding.  Such a syllabus, in its\nAristotelian aspect, indicated the unity of all departments of\nliterature\u2014or learning as we now call it \u2014 which was\ncongenial to one with Burke\u2019s passion for knowledge \u2014 he\nwrote of his furor mathematicus, furor logicus,\nfuror historicus, and furor poeticus.  [3] It also indicated the\nrange of achievements, and the range of needs, that people had\ngenerated. The extent and variety of human activity impressed itself\nupon Burke. If his practical situation in Ireland suggested that not\nreason alone but also Christianity and persuasion were necessary to\nimprovement, Burke could now understand these needs in terms of a\nscheme of learning, and indeed had the opportunity to develop the\ncorresponding skills. At Trinity he founded a debating society, where\nhe developed his oratorical technique on theological, moral and\npolitical topics, as well as commenting on the economic and literary\nlife of Ireland in a periodical run by himself and his friends. This\nacquisition of skills was complemented by an opportunity for\nphilosophical development. This applied in particular to Burke\u2019s\nantecedent bent towards the imaginative branches of literature,\nespecially romances of chivalry, such as the Faerie Queen by\nEdmund Spenser (the collateral ancestor from whom he derived his\nChristian name). Creations of alternative worlds by the mind now\nreceived a philosophical warrant from another part of the Trinity\nsyllabus. Locke had recognized that the mind devised complex\nideas. The mind had a power to receive simple ideas from the senses\nand from its own reflection on them, and to make out of this material\nfurther ideas that had no referent in the world of\nsensation. Burke\u2019s interest did not extend to the centaurs that\nLocke had mentioned, but the ability to make complex ideas and to\nassemble them in new ways was central to Burke\u2019s way of\nproceeding. His philosophical method involved thinking in terms of\ncomplex ideas about a connected range of matters, matters connected by\ntheir place in a programme of human improvement. Reason was\nfundamental to this method\u2014but not reason alone, as we see in\nBurke\u2019s sole work devoted wholly to philosophy, which made use\nof Locke on the way to an original destination. ",
