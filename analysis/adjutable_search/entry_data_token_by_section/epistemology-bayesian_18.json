Synchronic Norms (II): The Problem of the Priors\n\nMuch of what Bayesians have to say about confirmation and inductive\ninference depends crucially on the norms that govern one\u2019s prior\ncredences (the credences that one has at the beginning of an inquiry).\nBut what are those norms? This is known as the problem of the\npriors. Some potential solutions were only sketched in the\ntutorial\n section 1.5.\n They will be detailed in this section.\n\n",
