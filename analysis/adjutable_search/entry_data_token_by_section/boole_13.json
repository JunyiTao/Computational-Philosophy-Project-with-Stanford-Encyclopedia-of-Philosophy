This error was forcefully pointed out by\nHailperin in his 1981 paper \u201cBoole\u2019s algebra isn\u2019t\nBoolean algebra,\u201d a theme repeated in his path-breaking book\nBoole\u2019s Logic and Probability (1986).  Nonetheless the\ngoal of the two algebras, Boole\u2019s algebra and Boolean algebra,\nis the same, to provide an equational logic for the calculus of\nclasses and for propositional logic.  Thanks to Hailperin\u2019s\nwritings, for the first time there was clarity as to why Boole\u2019s\nalgebra gave correct results. \n\nIn his 1959 JSL review article Michael Dummett said:\n\nanyone unacquainted with Boole\u2019s works will receive an\nunpleasant surprise when he discovers how ill constructed his theory\nactually was and how confused his explanations of it.\n\n\nFor example, one does not find a clear statement \n of what Boole meant by equivalent or interpretable. \nFor those familiar with partial algebras the latter word can easily \nbe taken to mean is defined\u2014the domain of\ndefinition of an algebraic term has a recursive definition, just as  \nalgebraic term has a recursive definition. After verifying examples like those\nin LT that show Boole\u2019s algebraic methods \ngive correct results for propositions about classes, the challenge for those\nwho want to make sense of Boole\u2019s algebra of logic\n is to make \nenough of the foundations of Boole\u2019s \nalgebra sufficiently precise so as to be able to justify the algebraic \nprocedures he used. \n\nIn LT Boole gave detailed instructions on how to use his algebra to obtain valid propositional conclusions from propositional premises about classes when the propositions were universal. (He avoided particular propositions until Chapter XV, the last chapter of  LT on logic.) He showed how to express English language propositions as equations, the steps needed to obtain desired conclusion equations, and how they are to be interpreted as conclusion propositions to the premises. The algebraic steps can be lengthy and he gave some shortcuts in Chapter IX, but we now know that any method to carry out such deductions will confront a complexity of computation that grows rapidly with the number of propositional variables. \n\nAs stated in Dummett\u2019s comment above, Boole was anything but clear as to why his algebra worked as claimed, to give best possible conclusions to premises. This has inspired considerable commentary on what Boole meant to say, or should have said, and to what extent his justifications are valid. \n\nJevons (1864) gave sharp criticisms on the shortcomings of \nBoole\u2019s algebra of logic and abandoned it to create the first\nversion of modern Boolean algebra. (He did not have the unary complement operation\nthat is now standard, but instead used De Morgan\u2019s convention that the complement of a class \\(A\\) is \\(a\\).)\nThe title of Jevon\u2019s 1864 book\nstarted out with the words Pure Logic, referring to the fact\nthat his version of the algebra of logic had been cleansed from\nconnections to the algebra of numbers. The same point would be made in\nthe introduction to Whitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica, that they had adopted the notation of Peano in part\nto free their work from such connections. \n\nAccording to Hailperin(1986), the proof-theoretic side of Boole\u2019s algebra is simply that of non-trivial commutative rings with unit and distinguished idempotent elements, but without non-zero additively or multiplicatively nilpotent elements. His favorite models were rings of signed multi-sets and he used them to \nexplain why Boole\u2019s theorems are correct for the algebra of \nlogic of universal propositions. (Hailperin\u2019s analysis did not apply to particular propositions.)\n\n Frank W. Brown\u2019s paper \nGeorge Boole\u2019s deductive system (2009) \nclaims that one can avoid Hailperin\u2019s signed multi-sets \nby working with the ring of polynomials Z[X] modulo a certain ideal. \n\nBurris and Sankappanavar (2013) use the fact that \nBoole\u2019s model, a partial-algebra, is isomorphic to the \nrestriction of the operations of addition, multiplication and subtraction in the\nring \\(Z^U\\) to the idempotent elements of the ring. Here \\(Z\\) is the ring of\nintegers, and \\(U\\) is the universe of discourse.\n\nFrom this one can deduce that any Horn sentence which holds in \\(Z\\) when the variables are restricted to 0 and 1 will hold in \\(Z^U\\) when the variables are restricted to idempotent elements, and thus will hold in Boole\u2019s partial-algebra.  This gives an expanded version of Boole\u2019s Rule of \n0 and 1, and since his main results (Expansion, Reduction, Elimination and Solution) can be expressed by such Horn sentences, one has a quick\nproof that they are indeed valid. \n\n",
