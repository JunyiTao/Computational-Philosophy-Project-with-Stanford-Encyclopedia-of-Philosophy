Kinds of Consciousness\n\nOne of the advances made in the last few decades has been to\ndistinguish between different questions concerning consciousness (see\nparticularly: Rosenthal 1986; Dretske 1993; Block 1995; Lycan 1996).\nNot everyone agrees on quite which distinctions need to be\ndrawn. But all are agreed that we should distinguish creature\nconsciousness from mental-state consciousness. It is one\nthing to say of an individual person or organism that it is\nconscious (either in general or of something in particular); and it is\nquite another thing to say of one of the mental states of a\ncreature that it is conscious.\n\nIt is also agreed that within creature-consciousness itself we should\ndistinguish between intransitive and transitive\nvariants. To say of an organism that it is conscious\nsimpliciter (intransitive) is to say just that it is awake,\nas opposed to asleep or comatose. There don\u2019t appear to be any\ndeep philosophical difficulties lurking here (or at least, they\naren\u2019t difficulties specific to the topic of consciousness, as\nopposed to mentality in general). But to say of an organism that it is\nconscious of such-and-such (transitive) is normally to say at\nleast that it is perceiving such-and-such, or aware\nof such-and-such. So we say of the mouse that it is conscious of\nthe cat outside its hole, in explaining why it doesn\u2019t come out;\nmeaning that it perceives the cat\u2019s presence. To\nprovide an account of transitive creature-consciousness would thus be\nto attempt a theory of perception.\n\nThere is a choice to be made concerning transitive\ncreature-consciousness, failure to notice which may be a potential\nsource of confusion. For we have to decide whether the perceptual\nstate in virtue of which an organism may be said to be\ntransitively-conscious of something must itself be a conscious one\n(state-conscious\u2014see below). If we say \u2018Yes\u2019 then we\nshall need to know more about the mouse than merely that it perceives\nthe cat if we are to be assured that it is conscious of the\ncat\u2014we shall need to establish that its percept of the cat is\nitself conscious. If we say \u2018No\u2019, on the other hand, then\nthe mouse\u2019s perception of the cat will be sufficient for the mouse to\ncount as conscious of the cat; but we may have to say that although it\nis conscious of the cat, the mental state in virtue of which it is so\nconscious is not itself a conscious one! It may be best to by-pass any\ndanger of confusion here by avoiding the language of\ntransitive-creature-consciousness altogether. Nothing of importance\nwould be lost to us by doing this. \n\nTurning now to the notion of mental-state consciousness, the\nmajor distinction here is between phenomenal consciousness,\non the one hand\u2014which is a property of states that it is\nlike something to be in, that have a distinctive\n\u2018feel\u2019 (Nagel 1974)\u2014and various\nfunctionally-definable forms of access consciousness, on the\nother (Block 1995). Most theorists believe that there are mental\nstates\u2014such as occurrent thoughts or judgments\u2014that are\naccess-conscious (in whatever is the correct functionally-definable\nsense), but that are not phenomenally conscious. In contrast, there is\nconsiderable dispute as to whether mental states can be\nphenomenally-conscious without also being conscious in the\nfunctionally-definable sense\u2014and even more dispute about whether\nphenomenal consciousness can be reductively explained in\nfunctional and/or representational terms.\n\nIt is plain that there is nothing deeply problematic about\nfunctionally-definable notions of mental-state consciousness, from a\nnaturalistic perspective. For mental functions and mental\nrepresentations are the staple fare of naturalistic accounts of the\nmind. But this leaves plenty of room for dispute about the form that\nthe correct functional account should take. Some claim that for a\nstate to be conscious in the relevant sense is for it to be poised to\nhave an impact on the organism\u2019s decision-making processes (Kirk 1994;\nDretske 1995; Tye 1995, 2000), perhaps also with the additional requirement\nthat those processes should be distinctively rational ones\n(Block 1995). Others think that the relevant requirement for\naccess-consciousness is that the state should be suitably related to\nhigher-order representations\u2014experiences and/or thoughts\u2014of\nthat very state (Armstrong 1968, 1984; Rosenthal 1986, 1993, 2005;\nDennett 1978a, 1991; Carruthers 1996, 2000, 2005; Lycan 1987,\n1996; Gennaro 2012).\n\nWhat is often thought to be naturalistically problematic, in\ncontrast, is phenomenal consciousness (Nagel 1974, 1984; Jackson 1982,\n1986; McGinn 1991; Block 1995; Chalmers 1996). And what is really and\ndeeply controversial is whether phenomenal consciousness can be\nexplained in terms of some or other functionally-definable\nnotion. Cognitive (or representational) theories\nmaintain that it can. Higher-order cognitive theories\nmaintain that phenomenal consciousness can be reductively explained in\nterms of representations (either experiences or thoughts) that are\nhigher-order. It is such theories that concern us here.\n2. The Motivation for a Higher-Order Approach\n\nHigher-order theories, like cognitive/representational theories in\ngeneral, assume that the right level at which to seek an\nexplanation of phenomenal consciousness is a cognitive one, providing\nan explanation in terms of some combination of causal role\nand intentional content. All such theories claim that\nphenomenal consciousness consists in a certain kind of intentional or\nrepresentational content (analog or\n\u2018fine-grained\u2019 in comparison with any concepts we possess)\nfiguring in a certain distinctive position in the causal architecture\nof the mind. They must therefore maintain that these latter sorts of\nmental property don\u2019t already implicate or presuppose phenomenal\nconsciousness. In fact, all cognitive accounts are united in rejecting\nthe thesis that the very properties of mind or\nmentality already presuppose phenomenal consciousness, as\nproposed by Searle (1992, 1997) for example. The higher-order approach\ndoes not attempt to reduce consciousness directly to neurophysiology\nbut rather its reduction is in mentalistic terms, that is, by using\nsuch notions as thoughts and awareness.\n\nThe major divide amongst representational theories of phenomenal\nconsciousness in general, is between accounts that are provided in\npurely first-order terms and those that implicate higher-order\nrepresentations of one sort or another (see below). These higher-order\ntheorists will allow that first-order accounts\u2014of the sort\ndefended by Dretske (1995) and Tye (1995), for example\u2014can\nalready make some progress with the problem of consciousness.\nAccording to first-order views, phenomenal consciousness consists in\nanalog or fine-grained contents that are available to the first-order\nprocesses that guide thought and action. So a phenomenally-conscious\npercept of red, for example, consists in a state with the analog\ncontent red which is tokened in such a way as to feed into\nthoughts about red, or into actions that are in one way or another\nguided by redness. Now, the point to note in favor of such an account\nis that it can explain the natural temptation to think that phenomenal\nconsciousness is in some sense ineffable, or\nindescribable. This will be because such states have\nfine-grained contents that can slip through the mesh of any conceptual\nnet. We can always distinguish many more shades of red than we have\nconcepts for, or could describe in language (other than\nindexically\u2014e.g., \u2018That shade\u2019).\n\nThe main motivation behind higher-order theories of consciousness, in\ncontrast, derives from the belief that all (or at least most)\nmental-state types admit of both conscious and unconscious varieties.\nAlmost everyone now accepts, for example, (post-Freud) that beliefs\nand desires can be activated unconsciously. (Think, here, of the way\nin which problems can apparently become resolved during sleep, or\nwhile one\u2019s attention is directed to other tasks. Notice, too, that\nappeals to unconscious intentional states are now routine in cognitive\nscience.) And then if we ask what makes the difference between a\nconscious and an unconscious mental state, one natural answer is that\nconscious states are states that we are aware of. And if\nawareness is thought to be a form of creature-consciousness\n(see section 1 above), then this will translate into the view that\nconscious states are states of which the subject is aware, or\nstates of which the subject is creature-conscious. That is to say,\nthese are states that are the objects of some sort of higher-order\nrepresentation\u2014whether a higher-order perception or experience,\nor a higher-order thought. This is similar to the widely referenced\nTransitivity Principle (TP) which says that a conscious state is a\nstate whose subject is, in some way, aware of being in it. On the\nother hand, a mental state of which a subject is\ncompletely unaware is clearly an unconscious state. (See also\nLycan\u2019s (2001b)\u2018related simple argument\u2019 for a\nhigher-order representation account of consciousness.)\n\nOne crucial question, then, is whether perceptual states as well as\nintentional states admit of both conscious and unconscious varieties. Can there\nbe, for example, such a thing as an unconscious visual perceptual\nstate? Higher-order theorists are united in thinking that there can.\nArmstrong (1968) uses the example of absent-minded driving to make the\npoint. Most of us at some time have had the rather unnerving\nexperience of \u2018coming to\u2019 after having been driving on\n\u2018automatic pilot\u2019 while our attention was directed\nelsewhere\u2014perhaps having been day-dreaming or engaged in intense\nconversation with a passenger. We were apparently not consciously\naware of much of the route we have recently taken, nor of any of the\nobstacles we avoided on the way. Yet we must surely have been\nseeing, or we would have crashed the car. Others have used\nthe example of blindsight (Carruthers 1989, 1996). This is a condition\nin which subjects have had a portion of their primary visual cortex\ndestroyed, and apparently become blind in a region of their visual\nfield as a result. But it has now been known for some time that if\nsubjects are asked to guess at the properties of their\n\u2018blind\u2019 field (e.g. whether it contains a horizontal or\nvertical grating, or whether it contains an \u2018X\u2019 or an\n\u2018O\u2019), they prove remarkably accurate. Subjects can also\nreach out and grasp objects in their \u2018blind\u2019 field with\nsomething like 80% or more of normal accuracy, and can catch a ball\nthrown from their \u2018blind\u2019 side, all without conscious\nawareness. (See Weiskrantz 1986, 1997, for details and\ndiscussion.)\n\nA powerful case for the existence of unconscious visual\nexperience has also been generated by the two-systems theory of\nvision proposed and defended by Milner and Goodale (1995; see also\nJacob and Jeannerod 2003; Glover 2004). They review a wide variety of\nkinds of neurological and neuro-psychological evidence for the\nsubstantial independence of two distinct visual systems, instantiated\nin the temporal and parietal lobes respectively. They conclude that\nthe parietal lobes provide a set of specialized semi-independent\nmodules for the on-line visual control of action; whereas the temporal\nlobes are primarily concerned with more off-line functions such as\nvisual learning and object recognition. And only the perceptions\ngenerated by the temporal-lobe system are phenomenally conscious, on\ntheir account. (Note that this isn\u2019t the familiar distinction between what\nand where visual systems, but is rather a successor to it.\nFor the temporal-lobe system is supposed to have access both to\nproperty information and to spatial information. Instead, it is a\ndistinction between a combined what-where system located in\nthe temporal lobes and a how-to or action-guiding system\nlocated in the parietal lobes.)\n\nTo get the flavor of Milner and Goodale\u2019s hypothesis, consider just\none strand from the wealth of evidence that they provide. This is a\nneurological syndrome called visual form agnosia, which\nresults from damage localized to both temporal lobes, leaving primary\nvisual cortex and the parietal lobes intact. (Visual form agnosia is\nnormally caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, for reasons that are\nlittle understood.) Such patients cannot recognize objects or shapes,\nand may be capable of little conscious visual experience; but their\nsensorimotor abilities remain largely intact.\n\nOne particular patient\u2014D.F.\u2014has now been examined in\nconsiderable detail. While D.F. is severely agnosic, she isn\u2019t\ncompletely lacking in conscious visual experience. Her capacities to\nperceive colors and textures are almost completely preserved. (Why\njust these sub-modules in her temporal cortex should have been spared\nisn\u2019t known.) As a result, she can sometimes guess the identity of a\npresented object\u2014recognizing a banana, say, from its yellow\ncolor and the distinctive texture of its surface. But she is unable to\nperceive the shape of the banana (whether straight or curved, say);\nnor its orientation (upright or horizontal; pointing towards her or\nacross). Yet many of her sensorimotor abilities are close to\nnormal\u2014she would be able to reach out and grasp the banana,\norienting her hand and wrist appropriately for its position and\norientation, and using a normal and appropriate finger grip. Under\nexperimental conditions it turns out that although D.F. is at chance\nwhen identifying the orientation of a broad line or letter-box, she is\nalmost normal when posting a letter through a similarly-shaped slot\noriented at random angles. In the same way, although she is at chance\nwhen trying to discriminate between rectangular blocks of very\ndifferent sizes, her reaching and grasping behaviors when asked to\npick up such a block are virtually indistinguishable from those of\nnormal controls. It is very hard to make sense of these data without\nsupposing that the sensorimotor perceptual system is functionally and\nanatomically distinct from the object-recognition/conscious\nsystem.\n\nBut what implications does this have for phenomenal consciousness?\nMust these unconscious percepts also be lacking in phenomenal\nproperties? Most people think so. While it may be possible to get\noneself to believe that the perceptions of the absent-minded car\ndriver can remain phenomenally conscious (perhaps lying outside of the\nfocus of attention, or being instantly forgotten), it is very hard to\nbelieve that either blindsight percepts or D.F.\u2019s sensorimotor\nperceptual states might be phenomenally conscious ones. For these\nperceptions are ones to which the subjects of those states are\nblind, and of which they cannot be aware. And the\nquestion, then, is what makes the relevant difference? What is it\nabout a conscious perception that renders it phenomenal, that\na blindsight perceptual state would correspondingly lack? Higher-order\ntheorists are united in thinking that the relevant difference consists\nin the presence of something higher-order in the first case\nthat is absent in the second. The same would go for the difference\nbetween unconscious and conscious desires, emotions, pains, and so\non. The core intuition, again, is that a phenomenally conscious state\nwill be a state of which the subject is aware.\n\nWhat options does a first-order theorist have to resist this\nconclusion? One is to deny that the data are as problematic as they\nappear (as does Dretske 1995). It can be said that the unconscious\nstates in question lack the kind of fineness of grain and richness of\ncontent necessary to count as genuinely perceptual states. On\nthis view, the contrast discussed above isn\u2019t really a difference\nbetween conscious and unconscious perceptions, but rather between\nconscious perceptions, on the one hand, and unconscious belief-like\nstates, on the other. Another option is to accept the distinction\nbetween conscious and unconscious perceptions, and then to explain\nthat distinction in first-order terms. It might be said, for example,\nthat conscious perceptions are those that are available to\nbelief and thought, whereas unconscious ones are\nthose that are available to guide movement (Kirk 1994). A\nfinal option is to bite the bullet, and insist that blindsight and\nsensorimotor perceptual states are indeed phenomenally conscious while\nnot being access-conscious. (See Block 1995; Tye 1995; and\nNelkin 1996; all of whom defend versions of this view.) On this\naccount, blindsight percepts are phenomenally conscious states to\nwhich the subjects of those states are blind. Higher-order theorists\nwill argue, of course, that none of these alternatives is acceptable\n(see, e.g., Carruthers 2000; Rosenthal 2005).\n\nFurther, Lau and Rosenthal (2011) survey the empirical evidence\npertaining to the difference between higher-order theories and\nfirst-order ones. While much is equivocal, and many questions are left\nunanswered, they point to a pair of studies that support a\nhigher-order account. One is Lau and Passingham (2006), who are able\nto demonstrate using carefully controlled stimuli that there are\ncircumstances in which people\u2019s subjective reports of visual\nexperience are impaired while their first-order discrimination\nabilities remain fully intact. They also find that visual\nconsciousness in these conditions is specifically associated with\nactivity in a region of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Then in a\nfollow-up study Rounis et al. (2010) find that transcranial magnetic\nstimulation directed at this region of cortex, thereby disrupting its\nactivity, also has a significant impact on people\u2019s meta-visual\nawareness, but again without impairing first-order task\nperformance. The degree to which the prefrontal cortex\nis required for having a conscious state and the view that\nthe prefrontal cortex is the likely site of all higher-order\nthoughts are also the subject of vigorous continuing debate (Block\n1995; Gennaro 2012, chapter nine; Kozuch 2014; Odegaard, Knight, and\nLau 2017). \n\nMost generally, then, higher-order theories of phenomenal consciousness\nclaim the following:\n\nHigher Order Theory (In General):\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a mental state (of a certain\nsort\u2014see below) that either is, or is disposed to be, the object\nof a higher-order representation of a certain sort (see below).\n\n\nHigher-order theorists do agree that one must normally become aware of\nthe lower-order state non-inferentially since mental states\ncan sometimes become targets of higher-order representation via\nconscious inference without being phenomenally conscious. For example,\nif I become aware of my unconscious desire to kill my boss because I\nhave consciously inferred it from a session with my psychiatrist, then\nthe characteristic phenomenal feel of such a conscious desire may be\nabsent. \n\nStill, there are then two main dimensions along which higher-order\ntheorists disagree amongst themselves. One concerns whether the\nhigher-order states in question are perception-like, on the one hand,\nor thought-like, on the other. A thought is composed of or constituted\nby concepts. Those taking the former option are\nhigher-order perception (often called\n\u2018inner-sense\u2019) theorists, and those taking the latter\noption are higher-order thought theorists. The two theories\nare therefore often abbreviated as HOP (higher-order perception) and\nHOT (higher-order thought) theory. The other general disagreement is\ninternal to higher-order thought approaches, and concerns whether the\nrelevant relation between the first-order state and the higher-order\nthought is one of availability or not.  That is, the question\nis whether a state is conscious by virtue of being disposed\nto give rise to a higher-order thought, or rather by virtue of being\nthe actual target of such a thought. These are the three main\noptions that will now concern us. (A fourth will be considered in\nsection 6.)\n3. Higher-Order Perception Theory\n\nAccording to this view, humans not only have first-order\nnon-conceptual and/or analog perceptions of states of their\nenvironments and bodies, they also have second-order non-conceptual\nand/or analog perceptions of their first-order states of perception.\nAnd the most popular version of higher-order perception (HOP) theory\nholds, in addition, that humans (and perhaps other animals) not only\nhave sense-organs that scan the environment/body to produce\nfine-grained representations, but they also have inner senses\nwhich scan the first-order senses (i.e. perceptual experiences) to\nproduce equally fine-grained, but higher-order, representations of\nthose outputs. A version of this view was first proposed by the\nBritish Empiricist philosopher John Locke (1690). In our own time it\nhas been defended especially by Armstrong (1968, 1984) and by Lycan\n(1996, 2004).\n\nA terminological point: \u2018inner-sense theory\u2019\nshould more strictly be called \u2018higher-order-sense\ntheory\u2019, since we of course have senses that are physically\n\u2018inner\u2019, such as pain-perception and internal\ntouch-perception, that aren\u2019t intended to fall under its\nscope. For these are first-order senses on a par with vision and\nhearing, differing only in that their purpose is to detect properties\nof the body, rather than of the external world (Hill 2004). According\nto the sort of higher-order theory that is presently under discussion,\nthese senses, too, will need to have their outputs scanned to produce\nhigher-order analog contents in order for those outputs to become\nphenomenally conscious. In what follows, however, the term\n\u2018inner sense\u2019 will be used to mean, more strictly,\n\u2018higher-order sense\u2019.\n\nWe therefore have the following proposal to consider:\n\nInner-Sense Theory:\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a state with\nanalog/non-conceptual intentional content, which is in turn the target\nof a higher-order analog/non-conceptual intentional state, via the\noperations of a faculty of \u2018inner sense\u2019.\n\n\nOn this account, the difference between a phenomenally conscious\npercept of red and the sort of unconscious percepts of red that guide\nthe guesses of a blindsighter and the activity of the sensorimotor\nsystem, is as follows. The former is scanned by our inner senses to\nproduce a higher-order analog state with the content experience of\nred or seems red, whereas the latter states\naren\u2019t\u2014they remain merely first-order states with the\nanalog content red; and in so remaining, they lack any\ndimension of seeming or subjectivity. According to\ninner-sense theory, it is the higher-order perceptual contents\nproduced by the operations of our inner-senses that make some mental\nstates with analog contents, but not others, available to their\nsubjects. \n\nOne of the main advantages of inner-sense theory is that it can\nexplain how it is possible for us to acquire purely recognitional\nconcepts of experience. For if we possess higher-order perceptual\ncontents, then it should be possible for us to learn to recognize the\noccurrence of our own perceptual states immediately grounded in those\nhigher-order analog contents. (Compare the way in which first-order\nperceptual contents representing color and sound enable us the acquire\nfirst-order recognitional concepts for colors and sounds.) And this\nshould be possible without those recognitional concepts thereby having\nany conceptual connections with our beliefs about the content of the\nstates recognized, nor with any of our surrounding mental\nconcepts. This is then how inner-sense theory will claim to explain\nthe familiar philosophical thought-experiments concerning one\u2019s\nown experiences, which are supposed to cause such problems for\nphysicalist/naturalistic accounts of the mind (Kripke 1972; Chalmers\n1996). (For discussion of this \u2018phenomenal concept\nstrategy\u2019 see Carruthers and Veillet 2007.)\n\nFor example, I can think, \u2018R [an experience as of red]\nmight have occurred in me, or might normally occur in others, in the\nabsence of any of its actual causes and effects.\u2019 So on any view\nof intentional content that sees content as tied to normal causes\n(i.e. to information carried) and/or to normal effects (i.e. to\nteleological or inferential role), experience of type R might\noccur without representing red. Likewise I can think,\n\u2018R might occur in someone without occupying the role of\nexperience, but rather (say) of belief.\u2019 In the same\nsort of way, I shall be able to think, \u2018P [an\nexperience of pain] might have occurred in me, or might occur in\nothers, in the absence of any of the usual causes and effects of pain.\nThere could be someone in whom P experiences occur but who\nisn\u2019t bothered by them, and where those experiences are never caused\nby tissue damage or other forms of bodily insult. And conversely,\nthere could be someone who behaves and acts just as I do when in pain,\nand in response to the same physical causes, but who is never subject\nto P types of experience.\u2019 If we possess purely\nrecognitional concepts of experience such as R and\nP, then the thinkability of such thoughts is unthreatening to\na naturalistic approach to the mind.\n\nInner sense theorists are thus well placed to respond to\nthose who claim that there is an unbridgeable explanatory gap between\nall physical, functional, and intentional facts, on the one hand, and\nthe facts of phenomenal consciousness, on the other (Levine 1983;\nChalmers 1996). And likewise they can explain the conceivability of\nzombies without becoming committed to the existence of any\nnon-physical properties of experience (contra Chalmers 1996).\nIt is the conceptual isolation of our higher-order\nrecognitional concepts of experience that explains how there can be no\na priori entailment between physical, functional, and intentional\nfacts and the occurrence of states of type R or P\n(where R and P express purely recognitional\nconcepts). \n\nInner-sense theory does face a number of difficulties, however. One\nobjection is as follows (see Dretske 1995; G\u00fczeldere 1995). If\ninner-sense theory were true, then how is it that there isn\u2019t any\nphenomenology distinctive of inner sense, in the way that there is a\nphenomenology associated with each outer sense? Since each of the\nouter senses gives rise to a distinctive set of phenomenological\nproperties, one might expect that if there were such a thing\nas inner sense, then there would also be a phenomenology distinctive\nof its operation. But there doesn\u2019t appear to be any.\n\nThis point turns on the so-called \u2018transparency\u2019 of our\nperceptual experience (Harman 1990). Concentrate as hard as you like\non your \u2018outer\u2019 (first-order) experiences\u2014you\nwon\u2019t find any further phenomenological properties\narising out of the attention you pay to them, beyond those already\nbelonging to the contents of the experiences themselves. Paying close\nattention to your experience of the color of the red rose, for\nexample, just produces attention to the redness\u2014a\nproperty of the rose. Put like this, however, the objection just seems\nto beg the question in favor of first-order theories of phenomenal\nconsciousness. It assumes that\nfirst-order\u2014\u2018outer\u2019\u2014perceptions already have a\nphenomenology independently of their targeting by inner sense. But\nthis is just what an inner-sense theorist will deny. And then in order\nto explain the absence of any kind of higher-order phenomenology, an\ninner-sense theorist only needs to maintain that our higher-order\nperceptions are never themselves targeted by an inner-sense-organ\nwhich might produce third-order analog representations of\nthem in turn.\n\nAnother objection to inner-sense theory is as follows (see Sturgeon\n2000). If there really were an organ of inner sense, then it ought to\nbe possible for it to malfunction, just as our first-order senses\nsometimes do. And in that case, it ought to be possible for someone to\nhave a first-order percept with the analog content red\ncausing a higher-order percept with the analog content\nseems-orange. Someone in this situation would be disposed to\njudge, \u2018It\u2019s red\u2019, immediately and non-inferentially (i.e.\nnot influenced by beliefs about the object\u2019s normal color or their own\nphysical state). But at the same time they would be disposed to judge,\n\u2018It seems orange\u2019. Not only does this sort of\nthing never apparently occur, but the idea that it might do so\nconflicts with a powerful intuition. This is that our awareness of our\nown experiences is immediate, in such a way that to\nthink that you are undergoing an experience of a certain\nsort is to be undergoing an experience of that sort. But if\ninner-sense theory is correct, then it ought to be possible for\nsomeone to believe that they are in a state of seeming-orange\nwhen they are actually in a state of seeming-red. (The\nproblem of misrepresentation will addressed further below in sections\n6 and 7.)\n\nA different sort of objection to inner-sense theory is developed by\nCarruthers (2000). It starts from the fact that the internal monitors\npostulated by such theories would need to have considerable\ncomputational complexity in order to generate the requisite\nhigher-order experiences. In order to perceive an experience, the\norganism would need to have mechanisms to generate a set of internal\nrepresentations with an analog or non-conceptual content representing\nthe content of that experience, in all its richness and fine-grained\ndetail. And notice that any inner scanner would have to be a physical\ndevice (just as the visual system itself is) which depends upon the\ndetection of those physical events in the brain that are the\noutputs of the various sensory systems (just as the visual system is a\nphysical device that depends upon detection of physical properties of\nsurfaces via the reflection of light). For it is hard to see how any\ninner scanner could detect the presence of an experience qua\nexperience. Rather, it would have to detect the physical\nrealizations of experiences in the brain, and construct the\nrequisite higher-order representation of the experiences that those\nphysical events realize, on the basis of that physical-information\ninput. This makes it seem inevitable that the scanning device that\nsupposedly generates higher-order experiences of our first-order\nvisual experience would have to be almost as sophisticated and complex\nas the visual system itself.\n\nGiven this complexity in the operations of our organs of inner sense,\nthere should be some plausible story to tell about the evolutionary\npressures that led to their construction (Pinker 1994, 1997). But\nthere would seem to be no such stories on the market. The most\nplausible suggestion is that inner-sense might have evolved to\nsubserve our capacity to think about the mental states of\nconspecifics, thus enabling us to predict their actions and manipulate\ntheir responses. (This is the so-called \u2018Machiavellian\nhypothesis\u2019 to explain the evolution of intelligence in the\ngreat-ape lineage. See Byrne and Whiten 1988, 1998; and see Goldman\n2006, for a view of inner sense of this sort.) But this suggestion\npresupposes that the organism must already have some capacity\nfor higher-order thought, since it is such thoughts that\ninner sense is supposed to subserve. And yet as we shall see shortly\n(in section 5), some higher-order theories can claim all of the\nadvantages of inner-sense theory as an explanation of phenomenal\nconsciousness, but without the need to postulate any \u2018inner\nscanners\u2019. \n\nLycan no longer holds HOP theory (Sauret and Lycan 2014) mainly\nbecause he now thinks that some sort of attention to\nfirst-order states is sufficient for an account of conscious states\nand there is little reason to suppose that the attentional mechanism\nin question is a higher-order representational state (see also Prinz\n2012).\n4. Higher-Order Thought Theory (1): Actualist\n\nActualist higher-order thought (HOT) theory is a proposal about the\nnature of state-consciousness in general, of which phenomenal\nconsciousness is but one species. Its main proponent has been\nRosenthal (1986, 1993, 2005). The proposal is this: a conscious mental\nstate M, of mine, is a state that is actually causing an\nactivated thought (generally a non-conscious one) that I have\nM, and causing it non-inferentially. (The qualification\nconcerning non-inferential causation will be discussed in a moment.)\nAn account of phenomenal consciousness can then be generated by\nstipulating that the mental state M should have some causal role\nand/or content of a certain distinctive sort in order to count as an\nexperience (e.g., with an analog content, perhaps), and that when\nM is an experience (or a mental image, bodily sensation, or\nemotional feeling), it will be phenomenally conscious when (and only\nwhen) suitably targeted. The HOT is typically of the form: \u2018I am\nin mental state M.\u2019\n\nWe therefore have the following proposal to consider:\n\nActualist Higher-Order Thought Theory:\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a state of a certain sort\n(e.g. with analog/non-conceptual intentional content, perhaps) which\nis the object of a higher-order thought, and which causes that thought\nnon-inferentially.\n\n\nAs noted earlier, Rosenthal interprets the non-inferential requirement\nas ruling out only conscious inferences in the generation of\na consciousness-making higher-order thought. This enables him to avoid\nhaving to say that my unconscious motives become conscious when I\nlearn of them under psychoanalysis, or that my jealousy is conscious\nwhen I learn of it by noticing and interpreting my own behavior. But\nRosenthal (2005) thinks that\nunconscious self-interpretation is acceptable as a source of\nthe conscious status of the states thereby attributed. So if I arrive\nat the thought that I am feeling cheerful by unconsciously noticing the\nspring in my own step and the smile on my own face and drawing an\nunconscious inference, my cheerfulness will thereby have been rendered\nconscious. This aspect of Rosenthal\u2019s actualist form of\nHOT theory would appear to be optional for a HOT theorist,\nhowever.\n\nIn addition, and more controversially, Rosenthal (2005) thinks that\nthe occurrence of a suitably caused HOT is sufficient for\nconsciousness, even in the absence of any targeted first-order state\n(usually called \u2018targetless\u2019 or \u2018empty\u2019\nHOTs). So I am undergoing a conscious experience of red provided that\nI think that I am undergoing an experience of red, even if I\nam actually in no first-order perceptual state whatever. This aspect\nof Rosenthal\u2019s view, too, appears optional for an actualist HOT\ntheorist. Such a theorist can\u2014and perhaps should\u2014insist\nthat phenomenally conscious experience occurs when and only when a\nfirst-order perceptual state causes a higher-order thought in the\nexistence of that state in a way that doesn\u2019t depend upon\nself-interpretation. In recent years, the twin problems\nof misrepresentation between HOTs and their first-order\ntargets as well as targetless HOT cases has led to\nsignificant disagreement among HOT theorists (see section 7\nbelow).  \n\nThe actualist HOT account avoids some of the difficulties inherent in\ninner-sense theory, while retaining the latter\u2019s ability to\nexplain the distinction between conscious and unconscious perceptions.\n(Conscious perceptions will be analog states that are targeted by a\nHOT, whereas perceptions such as those involved in blindsight or\nsubliminal perceptions will be unconscious by virtue of not\nbeing so targeted.) In particular, it is easy to see a function for\nHOTs, in general, and to tell a story about their likely evolution. A\ncapacity to entertain HOTs about experiences would enable a creature\nto negotiate the is/seems distinction, perhaps learning not to trust\nits own experiences in certain circumstances, and also to induce\nappearances in others, by deceit. And a capacity to entertain HOTs\nabout mental states (such as beliefs and desires) would enable a\ncreature to reflect on, and to alter, its own beliefs and patterns of\nreasoning, as well as to predict and manipulate the thoughts and\nbehaviors of others. Indeed, it can plausibly be claimed that it is\nour capacity to target higher-order thoughts on our own mental states\nthat underlies our status as rational agents (Burge 1996; Sperber\n1996; Rolls 2004).\n\nA common initial objection to HOT theory (or even HOP) is that they\nlead to an infinite regress.  It might seem that an infinite regress\nresults because a conscious mental state (M) must be accompanied by a\nHOT, which, in turn must be accompanied by another HOT and so\non. However, the standard and widely accepted reply or explanation is\nthat when M is conscious, the HOT is not itself conscious (Rosenthal\n1986, 2005).  M is a first-order world-directed conscious state, such\nas a desire or perception, accompanied by an unconscious HOT. But when\nthe HOT is itself conscious, there is a yet another higher-order (or\nthird-order) thought directed at the conscious HOT. This would be a\ncase of introspection according to HOT theory such that\none\u2019s attention is directed inward at M (such as introspecting\nmy desire). When this crucial distinction is overlooked, it can lead\nto some misguided objections such as supposing that, according to HOT\ntheory, having any conscious state (even for animals and infants)\nrequires the ability to introspect.\n\nOne objection to HOT theory is due to Dretske (1993). We are asked to\nimagine a case in which we carefully examine two line-drawings, say\n(or in Dretske\u2019s example, two patterns of differently-sized\nspots). These drawings are similar in almost all respects, but differ\nin just one aspect\u2014in Dretske\u2019s example, one of the\npictures contains a black spot that the other lacks. It is surely\nplausible that, in the course of examining these two pictures, one\nwill have enjoyed a conscious visual experience of the respect in\nwhich they differ\u2014e.g. of the offending spot.  But, as is\nfamiliar, one can be in this position while not knowing\nthat the two pictures are different, or in what way\nthey are different. In which case, since one can have a conscious\nexperience (e.g. of the spot) without being aware that one is having\nit, consciousness cannot require higher-order awareness.\n\nReplies to this objection have been made by Seager (1994), Byrne\n(1997), and Rosenthal (2005), among others. They point out that it is\none thing to have a conscious experience of the aspect that\ndifferentiates the two pictures, and quite another to consciously\nexperience that the two pictures are differentiated by that aspect.\nThat is, consciously seeing the extra spot in one picture needn\u2019t mean\nseeing that this is the difference between the two pictures. So while\nscanning the two pictures one will enjoy conscious experience of the\nextra spot. A HOT theorist will say that this means\nundergoing a percept with the content spot here that\nforms the target of a HOT that one is undergoing a\nperception with that content. But this can perfectly well be true\nwithout one undergoing a percept with the content spot here in\nthis picture but absent here in that one. And it can also be true\nwithout one forming any HOT to the effect that one is\nundergoing a perception with the content spot here\nwhen looking at a given picture but not when looking at the other. In\nwhich case the purported counter-example isn\u2019t really a\ncounter-example.\n\nAnother objection to actualist HOT theory is epistemological, and is\ndue to Goldman (2000). It turns crucially on the fact that the\nconsciousness-making higher-order thoughts postulated by the theory\nare, themselves, characteristically unconscious. The\nobjection goes like this. When I undergo a conscious mental state\nM, I generally know, or have good reason to believe, that\nM is conscious. But how can this be, if what\nmakes M conscious is the existence of an\nunconscious HOT targeted on M?  Since I don\u2019t\nknow that this thought exists, it seems that I shouldn\u2019t be able\nto know that M is conscious, either. As Goldman himself\nacknowledges, however, this argument can only really work on the\nassumption that actualist HOT theory is supposed to be some sort of\nanalytic or logical truth. Rosenthal has always made clear, however,\nthat the theory isn\u2019t intended to be a piece of conceptual\nanalysis, but is rather an account of the properties that\nconstitute the property of being conscious (see Rosenthal\n1986, as well as his 2005). And the epistemological argument gets no\ntraction against this sort of view.\n\nA different sort of problem with the actualist version of higher-order\nthought theory relates to the huge number of thoughts that would have\nto be caused by any given phenomenally conscious experience. (This is\nthe analogue of the \u2018computational complexity\u2019 objection\nto inner-sense theory, sketched in section 3 above). Consider just how\nrich and detailed a conscious experience can be. It would seem that\nthere can be an immense amount of which we can be consciously aware at\nany one time. Imagine looking down on a city from a window high up in\na tower-block, for example. In such a case you can have phenomenally\nconscious percepts of a complex distribution of trees, roads, and\nbuildings; colors on the ground and in the sky above; moving cars and\npedestrians; and so on. And you can\u2014it seems\u2014be conscious\nof all of this simultaneously. According to actualist HOT theory,\nthen, it seems you would need to have a distinct activated HOT for\neach distinct aspect of your experience\u2014either that, or just a\nfew such thoughts with immensely complex contents. Either way, the\nobjection is the same. For it seems implausible that all of this\nhigher-order activity should be taking place (albeit non-consciously)\nevery time someone is the subject of a complex conscious\nexperience. What would be the point? And think of the amount of\ncognitive/neural space that these thoughts would take up! (In\ncontrast, we know that neural tissue and activity are expensive; see\nAiello and Wheeler 1995; and we also know that as a result of such\nconstraints, the wiring diagram for the brain is about as efficient as\nit is possible for it to be; see Cherniak\net al. 2004.)\n\nThis objection to actualist forms of HOT theory is considered at some\nlength in Carruthers (2000), where a variety of possible replies are\ndiscussed and evaluated. Perhaps the most plausible and challenging\nsuch reply would be to deny the main premise lying behind the\nobjection, concerning the rich nature of phenomenally conscious\nexperience. The theory could align itself with Dennett\u2019s (1991)\nconception of consciousness as highly fragmented, with multiple\nstreams of perceptual content being processed in parallel in different\nregions of the brain, and with no stage at which all of these contents\nare routinely integrated into a phenomenally conscious perceptual\nmanifold. Rather, contents become conscious on a piecemeal basis, as a\nresult of internal or external\nprobing that gives rise to a HOT about the\ncontent in question. This serves to convey to us the mere illusion of riches,\nbecause wherever we direct our attention, there we find a conscious\nperceptual content. (For a related reply, see Gennaro 2012, chapter six). \n\nIt is difficult to know whether this sort of \u2018fragmentist\u2019\naccount can really explain the phenomenology of our experience,\nhowever. For it still faces the objection that the objects of\nattention can be immensely rich and varied at any given moment, hence\nrequiring there to be an equally rich and varied repertoire of HOTs\ntokened at the same time. Think of immersing yourself in the colors\nand textures of a Van Gogh painting, for example, or the scene as you\nlook out at your garden\u2014it would seem that one can be\nphenomenally conscious of a highly complex set of properties,\nwhich one could not even begin to describe or conceptualize in any\ndetail. However, since the issues here are large and controversial, it\ncannot yet be concluded that actualist forms of HOT theory have been\nrefuted. This is particularly the case when one considers such\nphenomena as change and inattentional blindness where subjects often\ndo not even notice somewhat significant changes occurring in\nan image or video even within one\u2019s focal visual field (Simons\n2000; Simons and Chabris 1999).\n\nAnother difficulty for actualist forms of HOT theory takes the form of\na puzzle: how can the targeting of a perceptual state by HOT make the\nformer \u2018light up\u2019, and acquire the properties of\n\u2018feel\u2019 or what it is like-ness?  Suppose, for\nexample, that I am undergoing an unconscious perception of red. How\ncould such a percept then acquire the properties distinctive of\nphenomenal consciousness merely by virtue of me coming to think (in\nnon-inferential fashion) that I am undergoing an experience of\nred?\n\nRosenthal (2005) replies to this objection by pointing to cases in\nwhich (he says) the acquisition and application of novel higher-order\nconcepts to our experience transforms the phenomenal properties of the\nlatter. Thus a course in wine-tasting can lead me to have experiences\nof the wine that are phenomenally quite distinct from any that I\nenjoyed previously (see also Siegel 2010; Gennaro 2012, chapter\nsix). And a course in classical music appreciation might lead to\nchanges in my experience of the sound of the orchestra, perhaps\ndistinguishing between the sounds of the oboes and the clarinets for\nthe first time. Since changes in higher-order concepts can lead to\nchanges in phenomenal consciousness, Rosenthal thinks, it is plausible\nthat it is the presence of higher-order thoughts targeting our\nperceptual states that is responsible for the latter\u2019s\nphenomenal properties tout court.\n\nIn response, an opponent of the theory might observe that some of the\nconcepts that one acquires in such cases do not appear to be\nhigher-order ones at all. Thus the concepts oaky\nand tanniny that one acquires when wine-tasting pick out\nsecondary qualities of the wine (which are first-order), not\nhigher-order properties of our experience of the wine. And likewise\nthe concept oboe when applied in an experience is a\nfirst-order concept of a sound type, not a higher-order concept of\none\u2019s experience of sound. The phenomenon here is quite general:\nacquiring and applying new concepts in one\u2019s perception can\ntransform the similarity spaces and organization of one\u2019s\nperceptual states. (Think here of the familiar duck/rabbit.) But it\nappears to be a first-order phenomenon, not a higher-order one. At any\nrate, there is considerable work for a HOT theorist to do here in\nmaking out the case to the contrary.\n5. Higher-Order Thought Theory (2): Dispositionalist\n\nAccording to the dispositionalist HOT theory, the conscious status of\nan perceptual state consists in its availability to\nhigher-order thought (Dennett 1978a; Carruthers 1996, 2000, 2005). As\nwith the non-dispositionalist version of the theory, in its simplest\nform we have here a quite general proposal concerning the conscious\nstatus of any type of occurrent mental state, which becomes an account\nof phenomenal consciousness when the states in question are\nexperiences (or images, emotions, etc.) with analog content. The\nproposal is this: a conscious mental event M, of mine, is one\nthat is disposed to cause an activated thought (generally a\nnon-conscious one) that I have\nM, and to cause it non-inferentially.\n\nThe proposal before us is therefore as follows:\n\nDispositionalist Higher-Order Thought Theory:\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a state of a certain sort\n(perhaps with analog/non-conceptual intentional content, and perhaps\nheld in a special-purpose short-term memory store) which is available\nto cause (non-inferentially) higher-order thoughts about itself (or\nperhaps about any of the contents of the memory store).\n\n\nIn contrast with the actualist form of theory, the higher-order\nthoughts that render a percept conscious are not necessarily actual,\nbut potential. So the objection now disappears, that an unbelievable\namount of cognitive space would have to be taken up with every\nconscious experience. (There need not actually be\nany HOT occurring, in order for a given perceptual state to\ncount as phenomenally conscious, on this view.) So we might be able to\nretain our belief in the rich and integrated nature of phenomenally\nconscious experience\u2014we just have to suppose that all of the\ncontents in question are simultaneously available to\nhigher-order thought. (Such availability might be realized by the\n\u2018global broadcast\u2019 of perceptual representations to a wide\nrange of conceptual systems in the brain, for drawing inferences, for\nforming memories, and for planning, as well as for forming\nhigher-order beliefs. See Baars 1988, 1997, 2002.) Nor will there be\nany problem in explaining why our faculty of higher-order thought\nshould have evolved, nor why it should have access to perceptual\ncontents in the first place\u2014this can be the standard sort of\nstory in terms of Machiavellian intelligence.\n\nIt might well be wondered how their mere availability to\nhigher-order thoughts could confer on our perceptual states the\npositive properties distinctive of phenomenal consciousness\u2014that\nis, of states having a subjective dimension, or a distinctive\nsubjective feel. The answer may lie in the theory of content.\nSuppose that one agrees with Millikan (1984) that the representational\ncontent of a state depends, in part, upon the powers of the systems\nthat consume that state. That is, suppose one thinks that\nwhat a state represents will depend, in part, on the kinds of\ninferences that the cognitive system is prepared to make in the\npresence of that state, or on the kinds of behavioral control that it\ncan exert. In that case the presence of first-order perceptual\nrepresentations to a consumer-system that can deploy a \u2018theory\nof mind\u2019, and that is capable of recognitional applications of\ntheoretically-embedded concepts of experience, may be sufficient to\nrender those representations at the same time as higher-order\nones. This would be what confers on our phenomenally conscious\nexperiences the dimension of subjectivity. Each experience would at\nthe same time (while also representing some state of the world, or of\nour own bodies) be a representation that we are undergoing just such\nan experience, by virtue of the powers of the \u2018theory of\nmind\u2019 system. Each percept of green, for example, would at one\nand the same time be an analog representation of green and an\nanalog (non-conceptual) representation of seems green\nor experience of green. (Consumer semantics embraces not only\na number of different varieties of teleosemantics, but also\nvarious forms of inferential role semantics. For the former,\nsee Millikan 1984, 1986, 1989; and Papineau 1987, 1993. For the\nlatter, see Loar 1981, 1982; McGinn 1982, 1989; Block 1986; and\nPeacocke 1986, 1992). \n\nAs an independent illustration of how consumer systems can transform\nperceptual contents, consider prosthetic vision (Bach-y-Rita 1995;\nBach-y-Rita and Kercel 2003). Blind subjects can be fitted with a\ndevice that transduces the output from a hand-held or head-mounted\nvideo-camera into patterns of electrically-induced tactile stimulation\nacross the subject\u2019s back or tongue. Initially, of course, the\nsubjects just feel patterns of gentle tickling sensations spreading\nover the area in question, while the camera scans what is in front of\nthem. But provided that they are allowed to control the movements of\nthe camera themselves, their experiences after a time acquire\nthree-dimensional distal intentional contents, representing the\npositions and movements of objects in space.(Note that the patterns of\ntactile simulations themselves become imbued with spatial content. The\nsubjects in question say that it has come to seem to them\nthat there is a spherical object moving towards them, for example.)\nHere everything on the input side remains the same as it was when\nsubjects first began to wear the device; but the planning and\naction-controlling systems have learned to interpret those states\ndifferently. And as a result, the subjects\u2019 first-order\nintentional perceptual contents have become quite different. Likewise,\naccording to dispositional HOT theory, when the \u2018theory of\nmind\u2019 system has learned to interpret the subject\u2019s\nperceptual states as perceptual states: they all acquire a\ndimension of seeming or subjectivity.\n\nProponents of this account hold that it achieves all of the benefits\nof inner-sense theory, but without the associated costs. (Some\npotential draw-backs will be noted in a moment.) In particular, we can\nendorse the claim that phenomenal consciousness consists in a set of\nhigher-order perceptions. This enables us to explain, not only the\ndifference between conscious and unconscious perception, but also how\nanalog states come to acquire a subjective dimension or\n\u2018feel\u2019. And we can also explain how it can be possible for\nus to acquire some purely recognitional concepts of experience (thus\nexplaining the standard philosophical thought-experiments concerning\nzombies and such-like). But we don\u2019t have to appeal to the\nexistence of any \u2018inner scanners\u2019 or organs of inner sense\n(together with their associated problems) in order to do\nthis. Moreover, it should also be obvious why there can be no question\nof our higher-order contents misrepresenting their first-order\ncounterparts, in such a way that one might be disposed to make\nrecognitional judgments of red and seems orange at\nthe same time. This is because the content of the higher-order\nexperience is parasitic on the content of the first-order\none. Carruthers, therefore, also refers to this view as dual\ncontent theory.\n\nOn the downside, the account isn\u2019t neutral on questions of\nsemantic theory. On the contrary, it requires us to reject any form of\npure input semantics, in favor of some sort of consumer semantics. We\ncannot then accept that intentional content reduces to informational\ncontent, nor that it can be explicated purely in terms of causal\nco-variance relations to the environment. So anyone who finds such\nviews attractive will think that the account is a hard one to swallow.\n(For discussion of various different versions of input semantics, see\nDretske 1981, 1986; Fodor 1987, 1990; and Loewer and Rey 1991.)\n\nMoreover, Rosenthal (2005) has objected that dispositional HOT theory\ncan\u2019t account for our actual awareness of our conscious\nmental states, since mere dispositions to entertain thoughts\ndoesn\u2019t make us aware of anything. Two replies can be made (see\nCarruthers 2000, 2005). One is that, in virtue of our disposition to\nentertain higher-order thoughts about it, a perceptual state will\nalready possess an analog higher-order content. It is this\ncontent that makes us aware of the experience in question. But the\nsecond reply is that there does, in any case, seem to be a perfectly\ngood dispositional sense of \u2018know\u2019 and\n\u2018aware\u2019. As Dennett pointed out long ago (1978b), I can be\nsaid to know, or to be aware, that zebras in the wild don\u2019t wear\novercoats, even though I have never actually considered the matter,\nbecause I am disposed to assent to that proposition in light\nof what I occurrently know.\n\nIn addition, Rowlands (2001) and Jehle and Kriegel (2006) have\nobjected that dispositional HOT theory can\u2019t explain the sense\nin which the phenomenal properties of experience are\ncategorical. For the higher-order analog intentional contents\nthat our conscious perceptual states possess\u2014and that are\nidentified with the \u2018feel\u2019 of experience\u2014are said to\nbe constituted by the dispositional property that such states have, of\ngiving rise to HOTs about themselves. This objection,\nhowever, appears to beg the question in favor of irreducible and\nintrinsic qualia as an account of the distinctive properties of\nphenomenally conscious states. In any case it doesn\u2019t seem to be an\nobjection against dispositional HOT theory as such, since it will\ncount equally against any representationalist theory of consciousness.\n(For example, Tye 1995, explains consciousness in terms of the\npoisedness of perceptual states to have an impact on belief\nand reasoning, which is a dispositional notion.) Any theory that\nproposes to reductively explain phenomenal consciousness in terms of\nsome combination of intentional content and causal role will be\nexplaining consciousness in terms that are at least partly\ndispositional. \n\nA well-known objection to dispositionalist higher-order thought\ntheory, however, is that it may have to deny phenomenal consciousness\nto most species of non-human animal. This objection will be discussed,\namong others, in section 7, since it can be raised\nagainst any form of higher-order theory.\n\nCarruthers no longer holds dispositional HOT theory or, for that\nmatter, any form of higher-order theory and actually defends a version\nof first-order representationalism instead (Carruthers 2017). He\nresponds to his own previous two main lines of argument against\nfirst-order representationalism and then finds it unnecessary to\npropose a higher-order theory in order to explain the difference\nbetween unconscious and conscious states. Still, Carruthers thinks\nthat dispositional HOT theory is preferable to actualist HOT\ntheory.\n6. Self-Representational Higher-Order Theories\n\nThe two most familiar forms of higher-order theory postulate the\nexistence of a pair of distinct mental states: a first-order\nperceptual or quasi-perceptual state with a given content, and a HOT\nor HOP representing the presence of that first-order state, thereby\nrendering it conscious. Either one of these states can occur without\nthe other, although there may be a reliable causal relation between\nthem, such that certain types of first-order perception (e.g. attended\noutputs of the temporal-lobe visual system) regularly cause\nhigher-order representations of themselves to be formed. In recent\nyears, however, a cluster of different proposals have been made that\nwould reject this independent-state assumption.  Rather, the\nrelationship between the conscious state in question and the\nhigher-order state is said to be constitutive, or\ninternal. To some extent, this view is inspired by Brentano\n(1874/1973) and the phenomenological tradition, including Sartre\n(1956). (See Kriegel 2006, 2018; Kriegel and Williford 2006; Zahavi\n2004; Miguens et al. 2016.) We can refer to these as\n\u2018self-representational\u2019 higher-order theories. (Kriegel\ninitially coined the term \u2018same-order monitoring theory\u2019\nbut this was potentially misleading).\n\nWe therefore have the following proposal to consider:\n\nSelf-Representational Theory:\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a state of a certain sort\n(perhaps with analog/non-conceptual intentional content) which also,\nat the same time, possesses an intentional content,\nthereby in some sense representing itself to the person who\nis the subject of that state.\n\n\nThere are two basic types of self-representational theory, depending\non whether the constitutive relation between the conscious state and\nthe higher-order state is one of identity, on the one hand,\nor part-whole, on the other. According to the former type of\naccount, it is one and the same perceptual state that is both\nfirst-order (representing the world to us) and higher-order\n(presenting itself to us). (Caston 2002, argues that Aristotle had a\ntheory of conscious perception of this sort.) Kriegel (2006) claims\nthat such accounts are rather mysterious from a naturalistic\nperspective, but Carruthers (2000, 2005) and perhaps also Van Gulick\n(2001, 2004) purport to provide naturalistic explanations of just this\nsort of view. According to Carruthers, a first-order perceptual state\nwith analog content acquires, at the same time, a higher-order analog\ncontent by virtue of its availability to a \u2018theory of\nmind\u2019 faculty, together with the truth of some suitable form of\nconsumer semantics (as explained in section 5 above). Van Gulick can\nbe interpreted as defending a similar view, which likewise relies on a\nform of consumer semantics/functional role semantics, which he labels\na \u2018Higher-Order Global State (HOGS) theory\u2019. On this\naccount, globally broadcast first-order perceptual states acquire at\nthe same time a higher-order\nseeming dimension though their availability to, and\nincorporation into, higher-order models of the self and its relation\nto the perceived environment. (What isn\u2019t entirely clear is whether\nVan Gulick thinks that the resulting perceptual state is the\nHOG state, or is rather a component part of the HOG\nstate\u2014in which case he would be advocating a kind of part-whole\nself-representational account.)\nKriegel\u2019s (2009) eventual view emphasizes and argues for the\nclaim that there is a ubiquitous conscious (but inattentive or\nperipheral) self-awareness which accompanies all first-order\n(attentive and outer-directed) conscious states. Gennaro (2012,\nchapter five) rejects this view by, among other things, arguing that\nit is difficult to make sense of such alleged pervasive peripheral\nself-awareness especially when one is focused on outer-directed\ntasks. It is at least not as clearly present as, say, outer-directed\nperipheral vision in normal visual perception. At minimum, it is\nnotoriously difficult to settle these sorts of disagreements between\ncompeting phenomenological claims.\n\nSome varieties of part-whole self-representational theory take the\nsame general form as actualist kinds of HOT theory, in which a\nfirst-order perceptual state with the content analog-red (as\nit might be) gives rise to a higher-order thought that one is\nexperiencing red. But rather than claiming that it is the first-order\nperception that becomes phenomenally conscious because of the presence\nof the higher-order thought, what is said that the complex state made\nup of both the first-order perception and the\nhigher-order thought becomes conscious. Gennaro (1996, 2008, 2012)\ndefends such a view which he calls the wide intrinsicality\nview such that the HOT is better thought of as belonging to the\nsame overall complex state as its target. It is, however, not always\nclear how this theory could offer any substantive benefits not already\nobtainable from actualist HOT theory. Rather, the claim is merely that\na conscious state is one that contains two parts, one of which is an\nawareness of the other. Kriegel himself (2003, 2006, 2009) and (as\nKriegel interprets him) Van Gulick (2001, 2004) emphasize that the\nfirst-order perception and the higher-order judgment need to\nbe integrated with one another in order for the resulting\ncomplex state to be phenomenally conscious.  Kriegel argues that there\nneeds to be a kind of integration resulting from a psychologically\nreal process (as opposed to a theorist\u2019s definition) in order\nfor the resulting state to have causal powers that differ from those\nof the first-order state/higher-order state pair.\n\nKriegel and Van Gulick do not give fully developed accounts of just\nwhy the integration of first-order perceptions with\nhigher-order judgments should give rise to the properties that are\ndistinctive of phenomenal consciousness. But one plausible\nreconstruction is as follows, modeled on the way that the\nconceptualization of analog (non-conceptual) first-order perceptual\ncontent can transform the latter\u2019s properties. Consider, for\nexample, the familiar duck/rabbit. When someone sees this figure for\nthe first time she may just experience a complex of curved lines,\nrepresenting nothing. But when she comes to see it as a\nrabbit, those lines take on a certain distinctive organization (the\nfigure now has both a front and a back, for example), thereby\ntransforming the represented properties of the figure. Arguably what\nhappens in such cases is that the conceptual systems succeed in\ndeploying a recognitional template for the concept rabbit,\nfinding a \u2018best match\u2019 with the incoming non-conceptual\nrepresentations. Indeed, there is reason to think that just such a\nprocess routinely takes place in perception, with conceptual systems\nseeking matches against incoming data, and with the resulting states\npossessing contents that integrate both conceptual and non-conceptual\n(analog) representations (Kosslyn 1994; Carruthers 2000). The result\nis a single perceptual state that represents both a\nparticular analog shape and a rabbit. Now suppose that when\nsuch states are globally broadcast and are made available to the\nsystems responsible for higher-order thought, a similar process takes\nplace. Those systems bring to bear the concept experience or\nthe concept seeing to produce a further integrated perceptual\nstate. This single state will not only have first-order contents\nrepresenting the lines on the page, and representing a rabbit, they\nwill also have a higher-order content representing that one is\nexperiencing something rabbit-like. Hence the perceptual\nstate in question becomes \u2018self-presenting\u2019, and acquires,\nas part of its content, a dimension of seeming or\nsubjectivity. (See also Gennaro 2005, 2012, for a related\nline of argument in response to this sort of challenge.)\n\nPicciuto (2011) points out, however, that Kriegel\u2019s form of\nself-representational theory still permits a mismatch between the\nfirst-order and higher-order components of the integrated state. For\nthere seems to be nothing in the structure of the account to rule out\nthe possibility of a first-order analog content green\nbecoming integrated with the higher-order judgment I am\nexperiencing yellow, for example. In order to avoid this\ndifficulty, Picciuto (2011) proposes an alternative form of part-whole\nself-representational theory. (See also Coleman, 2015; Timpe, 2015.)\nHe does so by appropriating, and deploying for a novel purpose, the\nidea of a quotational phenomenal concept, originally\nintroduced by Papineau (2002) and Balog (2009) as part of their\ndefense of physicalism against the arguments of Chalmers (1996) and\nothers. Picciuto\u2019s idea is that the relevant sort of complex\nself-representational state will consist of a first-order perceptual\ncontent combined with a higher-order concept like experience\nthat embeds, or \u2018quotes\u2019 that very perceptual\ncontent. Given this structure, it will be impossible that there should\nbe a mismatch between the two. For the higher-order component of the\ncomplex state is not a judgment about the experience\ncomponent (which would permit them to be mismatched) but rather a\nconcept that quotes the experience component.\n\nAll part-whole self-representational accounts differ from the\ndual-content theory of Carruthers (2000, 2005) in the following way,\nhowever: on Carruthers\u2019 account, the end-product can be entirely\nnon-conceptual. And in particular, the higher-order content possessed\nby a conscious percept is a non-conceptual one, representing a\nseeming of the first-order content of the state by virtue of\nits availability to higher-order consumer systems. On all of the\npart-whole accounts sketched above, in contrast, a conscious\nperception is always partially conceptual, containing the higher-order\nconcept experience (or something similar) as part of its\ncontent. There are probably multiple dimensions along which these two\nsorts of theory could be compared, and each may have its own\nadvantages. \n7. Objections to a Higher-Order Approach\n\nThere have, of course, been a whole host of objections raised against\nhigher-order theories of phenomenal consciousness over the years.\n(See, e.g., Aquila 1990; Jamieson and Bekoff 1992; Dretske 1993, 1995;\nGoldman 1993, 2000; G\u00fczeldere 1995; Tye 1995; Chalmers 1996;\nByrne 1997; Siewert 1998; Levine 2001; Rowlands 2001; Seager 2004;\nBlock, 2011.) Many of these objections, although perhaps intended as\nobjections to higher-order theories as such, are often framed in terms\nof one or another particular version of such a theory. A general moral\nto be taken away from the present discussion should then be this: the\ndifferent versions of a higher-order theory of phenomenal\nconsciousness need to be kept distinct from one another, and critics\nshould take care to state which version of the approach is under\nattack, or to frame objections that turn merely on the\nhigher-order character of all of these approaches. I shall discuss a few\n\u2018local\u2019 objections first, before discussing some generic\nones.\n7.1 Local objections\n\nA good many objections against specific versions of higher-order\ntheory have already been discussed above. Thus in section 3 we\ndiscussed Dretske\u2019s (1995) \u2018lack of any higher-order\nphenomenology\u2019 objection to inner sense theory (which\nonly targets inner sense theory). And in section 4 we\ndiscussed Dretske\u2019s (1993) \u2018spot\u2019 objection to actualist\nhigher-order thought theory, as well as Goldman\u2019s (2000)\nepistemological objection, each of which appears to apply only to HOT\ntheories. Of course some of the objections discussed above target more\nthan one version of higher-order theory, while still not being fully\ngeneral in scope. Thus the cognitive/computational complexity\nobjections discussed in sections 3 and 4 apply to inner sense theories\nand to actualist HOT theories, but not to dispositionalist HOT or to\nsome self-representational theories.\n\nAnother \u2018local\u2019 objection (which is actually a\ngeneralization of a variant of the misrepresentation problem discussed\nin connection with inner sense theory in section 3 above) is the\ntargetless higher-order representation problem (Byrne 1997; Neander\n1998; Levine 2001). This is confronted by both inner sense theory and\nactualist HOT theory (but not by either dispositionalist HOT or\nself-representational theories, according to which the relevant\nhigher-order state can\u2019t exist in the absence of the targeted\nstate).  For in each case it seems that a higher-order experience of a\nperception of red, say, or a HOT about a perception of red, might\nexist in the absence of any such perception occurring.  So it\nwould seem to the subject that she is experiencing red, or\nshe might think that she is experiencing red, in the absence\nof any such experience. (Note that the point isn\u2019t just that she\nmight undergo such a seeming in the absence of anything really\nred. Rather, the point is that she might not really be undergoing any\nsort of visual experience as of red at all.) In which case,\ndoes the subject have a phenomenally conscious experience as\nof red, or not?\n\nBoth Lycan (1996) and Rosenthal (2005) are sanguine in the face of\nthis objection. Each allows that targetless higher-order\nrepresentations are a possibility (albeit rare, perhaps), and each\nopts to say that the subject in such a case is phenomenally conscious.\nBut each denies that this is a problem for their account. Lycan, for\nexample, insists that it is surely possible that it might\nseem to someone that she is feeling pain when really no\nrelevant first-order representation of pain is present. (He suggests\nthat the effects of morphine, which leaves patients saying that their\npain feels just as it was, but that they no longer care, might\nconstitute such a case.) And surely such a person would have a\nphenomenally conscious experience as of pain. Rosenthal,\nlikewise, uses pain as an example. He points to cases of dental\npatients who initially experience pain in the dentist\u2019s chair despite\nthe fact that the relevant nerves are completely destroyed. It seems\nthat their fear, combined with the noise and vibration of the drill,\ncauses them to mistakenly think that they are feeling pain. (When\nthe drilling is stopped, and their dead nerves are explained to them,\nthey thereafter experience only the sound and the vibration.) So this\nwould be a case in which a HOT about experiencing\npain is alone sufficient to induce a phenomenally conscious experience\nas of being in pain. A critic, however, might respond that\nthe illusion is caused, instead, by a vivid imagining of\npain, rather than by a HOT about feeling pain.  Alternatively, if a\nHOT is causally involved it might be that a top-down expectation of\npain causes a first-order experience of pain, as opposed to\nbeing constitutive of the feeling of pain. It might be\nthat introspective anticipation of pain causes the pain in\nthe first-place. (Note that this seems perfectly possible, since it is\nthe opposite of well-known placebo effects of expectation in reducing\npain.)\n The targetless HOT problem has recently become a very significant\ntopic of debate among HOT theorists as well as some critics (Block\n2011; Rosenthal 2005, 2011; Weisberg 2011; Gennaro 2012, chapter four;\nWilberg 2010; Berger 2014, 2017; Brown 2015; Lau and Brown 2019) which\nhas also led some to advocate for other variants of HOT theory or to\nclarify their own theories. Gennaro (2012) argues, for example, that\nsince the HOTs in question are typically themselves unconscious, it\nmakes little sense to suppose that these HOTs are phenomenally\nconscious in the context of HOT theory, especially since a conscious\nHOT would be an introspective state instead. Maintaining that an\nunconscious HOT would yield the same subjective experience without any\ntarget state seems to run counter to a central initial motivation of\nHOT theory, namely, to explain what makes a first-order state\nconscious. Thus, the first-order state must exist first in order to be\nrendered conscious by an appropriate and accompanying HOT with some\nsort of corresponding conceptual content.  If both aren\u2019t\npresent, then no relevant conscious state occurs (see also Wilberg\n2010). Berger (2014), however, argues that consciousness is not a\nproperty of states at all; instead, it is a property of individual\npersons (that is, how my mental states appear to me). And\nBrown (2015) challenges the very assumption that HOT theory is best\ninterpreted as a relational theory at all; instead, it is better\nconstrued as a HOROR theory, that is, higher-order representation of a\nrepresentation, regardless of whether or not the target representation\nexists. In this sense, HOT theory is better understood\nas non-relational which also seems to be Rosenthal\u2019s\nconsidered view in recent decades. The debate continues (Rosenthal\n2018). \n\nIn response specifically to Block (2011), Rosenthal (2011) and\nWeisberg (2011) stress that the mere seeming of, say, being\nin pain (provided by the HOT that one is in pain in the absence of\nfirst-order pain) is sufficient for phenomenally conscious\npain. Consciousness is about mental appearance. It is not\nclear that this fully addresses Block\u2019s point, which is that one\nwould not expect the mere thoughts that one feels pain\nto matter to us in all the ways that pain matters. Block\ndevelops this point with respect to the awfulness of pain. It\nwould be remarkable (indeed, mysterious) if a higher-order thought\nshould have all of the causal powers of the mental state that the\nthought is about. And in particular, there is no reason to expect that\na HOT that one is in pain should possess the negative valence and\nhigh-arousal properties of pain itself. But the latter are surely\ncrucial components of phenomenally conscious pain. If so, then a HOT\nthat one feels pain in the absence of first-order pain\nwill not be sufficient for the conscious feeling of pain. It\nis also again important not to conflate introspection (conscious HOTs)\nwith mere unconscious HOTs. (See also Shepherd 2013.)\n\nYet another \u2018local\u2019 objection is targeted against\nhigher-order thought theories in particular (whether actualist or\ndispositionalist). It presents such theories with a dilemma: either\nthey are attempts to explicate the concept of consciousness,\nin which case they are circular; or they are attempts to provide a\nreductive explanation of the property of being conscious, in\nwhich case they generate a vicious regress (Rowlands 2001). The first\nhorn can be swiftly dismissed. For as Rosenthal (2005) and many others\nhave made clear, higher-order theories aren\u2019t in the business of\nconceptual analysis. Rather, their goal is to provide a reductive\nexplanation of what it is for a state to be phenomenally\nconscious. Our discussion will therefore focus upon the second\nhorn.\n\nRowlands thinks that HOT theories face a vicious regress because they\nexplain state-consciousness in terms of HOT, and because (Rowlands\nclaims) only conscious thoughts make us aware of the things\nthat those thoughts concern. He gives the example of coming to believe\nthat his dog is seriously ill. If he (Rowlands) thinks and behaves in\nways that are best explained by attributing to him the thought that\nhis dog is ill, but if that thoughts isn\u2019t entertained\nconsciously, then surely this won\u2019t be a case in which he\nis aware that his dog is ill. So if we are to become aware of\nour conscious states by entertaining higher-order thoughts about them,\nthen these thoughts will have to be conscious ones, requiring us to be\naware of them, in turn, via further higher-order thoughts that are\nalso conscious; and so on.\n\nHOT theorists might respond in several ways: One is to challenge the\nintuition that only conscious thoughts make us aware of things. Thus\nit seems that Rowlands, when reflecting back on his dog-nurturing\nbehavior of recent days, could surely conclude something along the\nlines of, \u2018It seems that I have been aware of my dog\u2019s\nillness all along; that is why I have been behaving as I have.\u2019\nAnother response would be to allow that there is a way of\nunderstanding the concept of awareness such that a person only counts\nas aware of something if the mental state in virtue of which they are\naware of that thing is itself a conscious one, but to deny that this\nis the relevant sense of \u2018awareness\u2019 which is put to work\nin HOT theories. A third option would be to stress the distinction\nbetween phenomenal consciousness and state consciousness more\ngenerally, claiming that there need be no regress involved in\nexplaining the former in terms of the latter, provided that some\nseparate account can be provided for the latter.\n7.2 Generic objections\n\nOne generic objection, which can probably be recast in such a way as\nto apply to any higher-order theory (although it is most easily\nexpressed against inner sense theory or actualist HOT theory), is the\nso-called \u2018rock\u2019 objection (Goldman 1993; Stubenberg\n1998). We don\u2019t think that when we become aware of a rock\n(either perceiving it, or entertaining a thought about it) that the\nrock thereby becomes conscious. So why should our higher-order\nawareness of a mental state render that mental state conscious?\nThinking about a rock doesn\u2019t make the rock \u2018light\nup\u2019 and become phenomenally conscious. So why should thinking\nabout my perception of the rock make the latter phenomenally\nconscious, either?\n\nAn initial reply to this objection involves pointing out that my\nperception of the rock is a mental state, whereas the rock\nitself isn\u2019t (Lycan 1996). Since phenomenal consciousness is a\nproperty that (some) mental states possess, we can then say that the\nreason why the rock isn\u2019t rendered phenomenally conscious by my\nawareness of it is that it isn\u2019t the right sort of\nthing to\nbe phenomenally conscious, whereas my perception of the rock\nis. This reply may be apt to strike the objector as trite. But perhaps\nmore can be said from the perspective of inner sense theory, at least.\nNotice that my perception of the rock does, in one sense, confer on the\nlatter a subjective aspect. For example, the rock is represented from\none particular spatial perspective, and only some of its properties\n(e.g. color) and not others (e.g. mass) are represented. Likewise,\nthen, with my perception of the rock. \n\nSimilar replies to the rock objection are given by Van Gulick (2001)\nand Gennaro (2005). Both point out that a rock isn\u2019t the kind of\nthing that can be incorporated into a complex mental state\nthat involves higher-order representations, in the sort of way\nrequired by a self-representational or HOT theory. In contrast,\nwhether actualist HOT theory can reply adequately to the rock\nobjection will depend on whether or not there is an adequate reply to\nthe problem considered in section 4, which challenges the actualist\nHOT theorist to say why targeting a mental state with a HOT about that\nstate should cause the latter to \u2018light up\u2019 and acquire a\nsubjective dimension or\nfeel.\n\nAnother generic objection is that higher-order theories, when combined\nwith plausible empirical claims about the mental abilities of\nnon-human animals, will conflict with our common-sense intuition that\nsuch animals enjoy phenomenally conscious experience (Jamieson and\nBekoff 1992; Dretske 1995; Tye 1995; Seager 2004). This objection can\nbe pressed most forcefully against higher-order thought\ntheories, of either variety, and against self-representational\ntheories; but it is also faced by inner-sense theory (depending on\nwhat account can be offered of the evolutionary function of organs of\ninner sense). Are cats and dogs really capable of having such\napparently complex HOTs which presumably contain mental state\nconcepts? Since there has been onsiderable dispute as to whether even\nchimpanzees (and other primates) have the kind of sophisticated\n\u2018theory of mind\u2019 to enable them to entertain thoughts\nabout experiential states as such (Byrne and Whiten 1988, 1998;\nPovinelli 2000), it seems implausible that many other species of\nmammal (let alone reptiles, birds, and fish) would qualify as\nphenomenally conscious, on these accounts (Carruthers 2000, 2005). Yet\nthe intuition that such creatures enjoy phenomenally conscious\nexperiences is a powerful one, for many people. (Witness Nagel\u2019s\nclassic 1974 paper, which argues that there must be something that it\nis like to be a bat.)\n\nMany higher-order theorists have attempted to resist the claim that\ntheir theory has any such entailment (e.g.  Gennaro 1996, 2004; Van\nGulick 2006). In each case, a common strategy is to claim that the\nrelevant higher-order representations are somehow\nsimpler than those tested for by those who do comparative\n\u2018theory of mind\u2019 research, hence leaving it open that\nthese simpler representations might be widespread in the animal\nkingdom. Gennaro (1996), for example, suggests that although animals\nmight lack the concept experience, they can nevertheless be\ncapable of higher-order indexical thoughts of the form\n\u2018this is different from that\u2019 (where\n\u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019 might refer to experiences\nof red and of green, respectively). The trouble here, however, is to\nexplain what makes these indexicals higher-order in content without\nattributing concepts like experience of green to the animal.\n\n\nGennaro (2004) takes a somewhat different tack. While allowing that\nanimals lack the concept experience of green, he thinks that\nthey might nevertheless possess the (simpler) concept seeing\ngreen. But here he faces a dilemma. There is, indeed, a simpler\nconcept of seeing, grounded in the capacity to track eye-direction and\nline of sight. But this isn\u2019t necessarily a higher-order\nconcept. To say, in this sense, that someone sees green in just to say\nthat there is some green in the line in which their eyes are\npointed\u2014no mental state needs to be attributed. In contrast, it\nappears that any concept of seeing that is genuinely higher-order will\nbe one that it would be less plausible to attribute to most species of\nanimal (given the comparative evidence). Perhaps a first-order\nexplanation of experimental observations of animals is virtually\nalways possible (see, for example, Carruthers 2008). But Gennaro\n(2012, chapter eight) ultimately argues that there is plenty of\nevidence that many animals are capable of metacognition (thinking\nabout their own mental states) as well as mindreading (thinking about\nother minds).  For example, in the case of mindreading, rhesus monkeys\nseem to attribute visual and auditory perceptions to others in more\ncompetitive paradigms (Flombaum and Santos 2005) and crows and scrub\njays return alone to caches seen by other animals and recache them in\nnew places (Emery and Clayton 2001). Any evidence of deception or\nempathy in animals would also seem to indicate some kind of\nmindreading ability. In addition, many animals seem capable of\nmetacognition (including possessing self-concepts) as evidenced by the\npresence of episodic memory, for example (Dere et al. 2006; see also\nthe essays in Terrace and Metcalf 2005; Hurley and Nudds 2006).  A\nrelated debate takes place with respect to infant consciousness and\nthe capacity of infants to have metacognitive and mindreading\nabilities (see Gennaro 2012, chapter seven, for some\ndiscussion).  \n\nVan Gulick (2006), in contrast, suggests that all of the higher-order\nrepresenting sufficient to render an experience phenomenally conscious\ncan be left merely implicit in the way that the experience\nenters into relationships with other mental states and the control of\nbehavior. So animals that lack the sorts of explicit higher-order\nconcepts tested for in comparative \u2018theory of mind\u2019\nresearch can nevertheless be phenomenally conscious. The difficulty\nhere, however, is to flesh out the relevant notion of implicitness in\nsuch a way that not every mental state, possessed by every creature\n(no matter how simple), will count as phenomenally conscious. For\nsince mental states can\u2019t occur singly, but are always part of a\nnetwork of other related states, mental states will always carry\ninformation about others, thus implicitly representing them. It is\nimplicit in the behavior of any creature that drinks, for example,\nthat it is thirsty; so the drinking behavior implicitly represents the\noccurrence of the mental state of thirst. \n\nOf course, the basis for the common-sense intuition that animals\npossess phenomenally conscious states can even be challenged. (How,\nafter all, are we supposed to know whether it is like\nsomething to be a bat?) And that intuition can perhaps be explained\naway as a mere by-product of imaginative identification with the\nanimal. (Since our\nimages of their experiences are phenomenally conscious, we\nmay naturally assume that the experiences imaged are\nsimilarly conscious (Carruthers 1999, 2000). But there is no doubt\nthat one major source of resistance to higher-order theories will lie\nhere, for many people, especially given various moral considerations\nabout animal pain and suffering. (For one set of attempts to defuse\nthis resistance, arguing that a higher-order account need have few if\nany implications for our moral practices or for comparative\npsychology, see Carruthers 2005, chapter nine; 2019, chapter eight.)\nOf course, some will point out that there are also\nenough neurophysiological similarities between (at least some\nparts of) human and animal brains to justify attributions of, say,\npains, desires, and basic perceptual states. It is worth emphasizing\nhere that HOT theory does not say that having conscious\nstates requires having introspective states, that is, having\nconscious HOTs. Conflating introspection with having mere unconscious\nHOTs (and therefore simply having first-order conscious states) may\nlead some to put forth a misguided straw man argument against HOT\ntheory.\n\nA third generic objection is that higher-order approaches cannot\nreally explain the distinctive properties of phenomenal\nconsciousness (Chalmers 1996; Siewert 1998; Levine 2006). Whereas the\nargument from animals is that higher-order representations\naren\u2019t\nnecessary for phenomenal consciousness, the argument here is\nthat such representations aren\u2019t sufficient. It is claimed,\nfor example, that we can easily conceive of creatures who enjoy the\npostulated kinds of higher-order representation, related in the right\nsort of way to their first-order perceptual states, but where those\ncreatures are wholly lacking in phenomenal consciousness.\n\nIn response to this objection, higher-order theorists will join forces\nwith first-order theorists and others in claiming that these objectors\npitch the standards for explaining phenomenal consciousness too high\n(Block and Stalnaker 1999; Tye 1999; Carruthers 2000, 2005; Lycan\n2001). They will insist that a reductive explanation of\nsomething\u2014and of phenomenal consciousness in\nparticular\u2014doesn\u2019t have to be such that we cannot conceive\nof the explanandum (that which is being explained) in the\nabsence of the explanans (that which does the explaining).\n(Indeed, we can also explain why no such explanation can be\nforthcoming, in terms of our possession of purely recognitional\nconcepts of experience.) Rather, we just need to have good reason to\nthink that the explained properties are constituted\nby the explaining ones, in such a way that nothing\nelse needed to be added to the world once the explaining\nproperties were present, in order for the world to contain the target\nphenomenon. But this is hotly contested territory. And it is on this\nground that the battle for phenomenal consciousness may ultimately be\nwon or lost.\n\nBefore we close, it is worth considering a variant of the third\ngeneric objection that we have just been discussing, which need\ninvolve no commitment to the latter\u2019s demanding standards of\nexplanation. For it might be said that self-representing mental states\n(or indeed any of the theoretically-relevant kinds of pairing of\nfirst-order with higher-order representations) might occur within the\nunconscious mind, without (of course) thereby becoming conscious (Rey,\n2008). Suppose that some version of Freudian theory is true, for\nexample. Might there not be higher-order thoughts about the\nsubject\u2019s experiences occurring within the unconscious mind,\nformed while the latter tries to figure out how to get its messages\npast the \u2018censor\u2019 and expressed in speech? So here again,\njust as with the third generic objection, the claim is that the\noccurrence of the sorts of representations postulated by higher-order\ntheories isn\u2019t\nsufficient for phenomenal consciousness.\n\nOne sort of response to this objection would be to deny that such\npurely unconscious higher-order cognition ever actually\noccurs. Indeed, one might deny that it is even possible, given the\nconstraints provided by the evolution of cognitively demanding mental\nfunctions (Carruthers 2000). But note that this reply will be\nunavailable to any higher-order theorist who has opted to downplay the\ncognitive demands of the capacity for higher-order representation in\nresponse to the problem of animal consciousness. For if higher-order\nrepresentation is easily evolved, and is rife within the animal\nkingdom, then there doesn\u2019t appear to be any reason why it\nshouldn\u2019t evolve within unconscious sub-systems of the mind as\nwell. And in any case it is doubtful whether the mere natural\nimpossibility of higher-order representing within the unconscious mind\nwould be enough to rebut the objection. Since higher-order theories\nclaim that phenomenal consciousness is to be identified with,\nor is\nconstituted by, the relevant sorts of higher-order\nrepresenting, we would need to show that the imagined occurrence of\nthe latter within the unconscious mind is metaphysically\nimpossible, not just that it is naturally so.\n\nOther responses to the objection remain (Carruthers 2000, 2005). One\nwould be to allow that unconscious phenomenal consciousness is\npossible, and to appeal to the distinction between phenomenal\nconsciousness and access consciousness to explain away the\nseeming contradiction involved. Remember, phenomenally conscious\nstates are those that it is like something to be in, and that\npossess a subjective feel; whereas access-conscious states\nare those that are available to interact with some specified cognitive\nprocesses (for example, they might be those that are reportable in\nspeech). So all we would be saying is that states with feel\ncan occur in ways that aren\u2019t (for example) reportable by the\nsubject.  There is no contradiction here. An alternative possible\nresponse would be to extend the higher-order theory in question to\ninclude the relevant sort of access-consciousness as a further\ncomponent. A dispositional HOT theorist, for example, might say that a\nphenomenally conscious state is one that both possesses the\nright sort of dual content and that is reportable by the\nsubject. I shall not attempt to adjudicate between these possibilities\nhere.\n\n(Objections have also been raised as to how (or if) HOT theory and\nself-representational theories can account for various pathologies of\nself-awareness or \u2018depersonalization disorders,\u2019 such as\nsomatoparaphrenia and thought insertion in schizophrenia. See the\nessays in Gennaro 2015 for some discussion.)\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aiello, L. and Wheeler, P., 1995. \u2018The expensive tissue\nhypothesis,\u2019 <em>Current Anthropology</em>, 36:\n199\u2013221.", "Aquila, R., 1990. \u2018Consciousness as higher-order thoughts:\ntwo objections,\u2019 <em>American Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 27:\n81\u201387.", "Armstrong, D., 1968. <em>A Materialist Theory of the Mind</em>,\nLondon: Routledge.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1984. \u2018Consciousness and\ncausality,\u2019 in D.
