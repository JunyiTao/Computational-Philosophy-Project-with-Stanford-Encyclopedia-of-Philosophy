    "main_text": "Virtue-Theoretic Approaches || Fake Barn Cases\n10.2 Fake Barn Cases\n\nUnderstanding knowledge as apt belief accommodates Gettier\u2019s\ntraditional counterexamples to the JTB theory rather\nstraightforwardly. When Smith believes that either Jones owns a Ford\nor Brown is in Barcelona, the accuracy of his belief is not\nattributable to his inferential skills (which the case does not call\ninto question). Rather, unlucky circumstances (the misleading evidence\nabout Jones\u2019s car) have interfered with his skillful cognitive\nperformance, just as the first diverting gust of wind interfered with\nthe archer\u2019s shot. Compensating for the unlucky interference, a\nlucky circumstance (Brown\u2019s coincidental presence in Barcelona)\nrenders the belief true after all, similar to the way in which the\nsecond gust of wind returns the archer\u2019s arrow back onto the\nproper path towards the target.\n\nFake barn cases, by contrast, may be less easily accommodated by\nSosa\u2019s AAA approach. When Henry looks at the only real barn in a\ncountryside full of barn facades, he uses a generally reliable\nperceptual faculty for recognizing barns, and he goes right in this\ninstance. Suppose we say the accuracy of Henry\u2019s belief\nmanifests his competence as a perceiver. If so, we would have to judge\nthat his belief is apt and therefore qualifies as an instance of\nknowledge. That would be a problematic outcome because the intuition\nthe case is meant to elicit is that Henry does not have\nknowledge. There are three ways in which an advocate of the AAA\napproach might respond to this difficulty.\n\nFirst, AAA advocates might argue that, although Henry has a general\ncompetence to recognize barns, he is deprived of this ability in his\ncurrent environment, precisely because he is in fake barn county.\nAccording to a second, subtly different strategy, Henry retains\nbarn-recognition competence, his current location notwithstanding,\nbut, due to the ubiquity of fake barns, his competence does not\nmanifest itself in his belief, since its truth is attributable more to\nluck than to his skill in recognizing\n barns.[34]\n Third, Sosa\u2019s own response to the problem is to bite the\nbullet. Judging Henry\u2019s belief to be apt, Sosa accepts the\noutcome that Henry knows there is a barn before him. He attempts to\nexplain away the counterintuitiveness of this result by emphasizing\nthe lack of a further epistemically valuable state, which he calls\n\u201creflective knowledge\u201d (see Sosa 2007: 31\u201332).\n",
