    "main_text": "Life and Relations to Predecessors || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nBoethius of Dacia, in Latin Boethius de Dacia or Boethius Dacus\n(\u201cB. from Denmark / the Dane\u201d) was a master of arts at the\nuniversity of Paris in the early 1270s, and probably already in the\nlate 1260s. Nothing is known about his background except his\nnationality. His Latinized name is likely to have rendered the Danish\nname \u201cBo\u201d. Some twentieth-century scholars refer to him as\n\u201cBoethius of Sweden\u201d, but this rests on a misunderstanding\nof the evidence, as shown by Jensen (1963).\n\nAccording to near-contemporary evidence, Boethius was, along with\nSiger of Brabant, one of the main targets of the great condemnation of\nMarch 1277 when bishop Stephen Tempier of Paris issued a list of 219\ntheses the teaching of which he prohibited (Hisette 1977: 11f.).\nModern research has, indeed, confirmed that several items of the list\nreflect passages in works by Boethius (Hisette 1977; Pich\u00e9\n1999). It is unknown whether Boethius was still alive in 1277; he may\nhave either died or left France some time before, for when in November\n1276, as a prelude to the condemnation, Simon du Val, inquisitor for\nFrance, cited some arts masters to appear before him, Siger was\nincluded, but Boethius was not. A fourteenth-century bibliography of\nworks by Dominican writers (\u201cThe Stams Catalogue\u201d)\nincludes Boethius, so it is possible that after his career in the arts\nfaculty he became a friar.\n",
