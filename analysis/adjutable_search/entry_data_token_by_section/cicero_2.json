    "main_text": "Dialogue and the Sceptical Stance\n3. Dialogue and the Sceptical Stance\n\nHis philosophical compositions bear out this approach in two important\nand connected ways. Firstly, they are by and large written in dialogue\nform (see Gorman 2005, Schofield 2008). His adoption of the form in\npart reflects his admiration for Plato, whom he considered the\ngreatest of all philosophers. Now Cicero\u2019s relation to Plato is\na complex one (see Long 1995b, H\u00f6sle 2008, Bishop 2019 ch. 2),\nand his use of the dialogue form differed from Plato\u2019s,\nmanifesting itself principally in opposed set speeches rather than\nrapid back-and-forth exchanges, though the latter are not completely\nabsent from Cicero\u2019s work (and long speeches are common enough\nin Plato). We find Cicero also invoking the (now lost) dialogues of\nAristotle and of the early Platonist philosopher Heraclides of Pontus\nas influences on him. Still, his favouring of dialogue over straight\ntreatise shares the Platonic motive of engaging readers in active\nphilosophical enquiry.\n\nThe majority of Cicero\u2019s philosophical writings feature a\nspeaker or series of speakers setting out the views held on a core\ntopic (for example, the nature of the gods, or the best way to live)\nby various philosophical schools, with a critique of those views\nmounted after each exposition, often by Cicero himself. Thus, in terms\nof their structure, his works lend themselves not to decisive\nacceptance or rejection of a particular view, but to a setting out of\nall sides of an argument so readers can make their own assessment.\n\nThis feature reflects, in turn, Cicero\u2019s allegiance to Academic\nscepticism. Now the extent and nature of this allegiance is a matter\nof debate (see Glucker 1988, G\u00f6rler 1995, Thorsrud 2012, Brittain\n2016, Wynne 2018) but what matters for present purposes is that the\nsceptical stance takes it as a mistake to believe that certainty is\npossible. The most one can do is form a judgement that some particular\nposition is more or less plausible than another, such a judgement\nitself being revisable in the light of further evidence or\nargument.\n\nThe truly philosophical approach is thus one that refuses to take any\nphilosophical view as settled \u2013 including this very one (see\nsection 7.1 below). Cicero thereby sets himself against the approach\nof the contemporary \u2018dogmatic\u2019 schools \u2013 in\nparticular, Epicureanism and Stoicism \u2013 where dogmatism refers\nnot to positions that are unargued for, but to doctrines regarded by\ntheir advocates as settled truth. Cicero\u2019s stance is not one\nthat pits itself primarily against specific doctrines of these schools\n\u2013 the sceptic is entitled to adopt any view as plausible.\nRather, what he opposes is a conception of intellectual endeavour as\ncapable of arriving at certainty. The best philosophy is one that\nfosters critical enquiry; and the nature and role of philosophy must,\nby the same token, itself be in the critical spotlight.\n",
