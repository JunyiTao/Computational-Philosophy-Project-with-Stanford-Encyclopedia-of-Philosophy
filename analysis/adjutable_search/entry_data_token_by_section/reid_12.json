    "main_text": "Causation and Free Will || Objecting to Hume\n4.1 Objecting to Hume\n\n\nReid develops his account of causation in light of Hume's account. As\nReid sees it, Hume starts with the assumption that if we are to learn\nwhat causation is, we must first determine from what aspect of our\nsensory experience the concept of causation is derived. Hume would put\nthe point in terms of the Way of Ideas as follows: we must determine\nfrom what impression our idea of causation is copied. However, Hume\nbelieved he had discovered that there is nothing in our sensory\nexperience corresponding to our ordinary notion of the causal\nrelation. In an inversion of the empiricist method attributed to Reid\nabove, Hume believed that causes necessitate their effects,\nthen he followed this commitment by arguing that we lack sensory\nawareness of this necessitation. We see the first billiard ball hit\nthe second. We see the second move. We do not see the movement of the\nfirst assure, or necessitate, the movement of the second. So\nHume concludes that causation must be something different from what we\ntake it to be ordinarily. \n\n\nBut what is it? To answer this question, we must determine from what\nsensory experiences we derive the idea of causation. It turns out, as\nReid reads Hume, that the sensory experiences that give rise to our\nidea of causation are sensory experiences of what Hume\ncalls constant conjunction. The heating of the water is\nregularly followed by the water's boiling. To say that the one event\ncauses the other is just to say that the two events always co-occur,\nor that there is a brute law linking them. This is not to say that the\nfirst event necessitates the second. The necessitation that we\nordinarily take to be involved in causation is not in the world; it is\nin our heads as an expectation arising due to previous experience.\n\n \nReid accepts much of the negative side of Hume's view of causation\nwhile rejecting Hume's assertions of the import of those negative\ndiscoveries. Reid agrees, that is, that we have no sensory experience\nof the necessitation of an effect by its cause. But this does not\nimply our ordinary concept of causation is mistaken. Instead, Reid\nthinks, the concept of causation is not an idea copied from a sensory\nimpression in the first place. Reid's complex thoughts here are tied\nto perception and the role of sensations in\nperception. (See 3.2 Reid's Arguments Against\nRepresentationalism, above.) For him, sensations never bear\nresemblance to the qualities they help us to perceive. It is hardly a\nsurprise, then, that the sensory experiences from which our thoughts\nabout causation spring bear no resemblance to the causal relation. But\nthis fact no more undermines our concept of causation than the lack of\nresemblance between our sensory experiences of ordinary physical\nobjects and those objects themselves undermines our thoughts about\nsuch objects. Like our thoughts about objects, our thoughts about the\ncausal relation are genuinely about the causal relation, despite the\nfact that the sensations from which those thoughts spring, i.e.the\nsensations of the relation of constant conjunction, bear no\nresemblance to the relation they lead us to think about. We have no\nsensations resembling necessitation, and, yet, causes necessitate\ntheir effects.\n\n\nHowever, Reid also offers criticisms of Hume's view of causation that\ncan be accepted independently of the Reidian view of perception and\nsensation. Two of his most influential criticisms are of Hume's view\nthat our ordinary concept of causation is reducible to the relation of\nconstant conjunction.\n\n \nOf the first he writes, \u201c[I]t would follow from [Hume's\ndefinition of causation], that whatever was singular in its nature, or\nthe first thing of its kind, could have no cause\u201d (EAP 4.9,\n250). Reid's point is that if the relation of causation is really that\nof constant conjunction, then the first time that two types of event\nare conjoined, the first cannot be the cause of the second. If there\nis no history of conjunction, there is no causation. It would seem to\nfollow from Hume's definition, for instance, that if an earthquake\nrazes Mexico City, and no earthquake has ever done so before, then the\nearthquake is not, in fact, the cause of the city's fall, an absurd\nimplication. This objection might not show Hume's theory is\nmistaken\u2014we omit consideration of it further here\u2014but it\ndoes pose a question with which any Humean must wrestle: Which\nconstant conjunctions are the genuine ones on the basis of which the\ncausal relation can be said to hold, and which are not? The more\nspecifically any two events are described, the more likely that there\nwill be no history of conjunction of the relevant sorts of events. But\nwhat degree of specificity or generality in description is the right\ndegree?\n\n\nThe problem is made clearer by Reid's second objection to Hume's\nanalysis of causation and constant conjunction. He writes, \u201cIt\nfollows from [Hume's] definition of a cause, that night is the cause\nof day, and day the cause of night. For no two things have more\nconstantly followed each other since the beginning of the world\u201d\n(EAP 4.9, 249). Since we don't ordinarily think that day is the cause\nof night, or vice versa, Hume must deny that the two are actually\nconstantly conjoined, or, rather, he must insist that the constant\nconjunction between the two of them is not of the right sort for the\nrelation between them to be one of causation. Hume thinks that there\nis causation between two events just in case there is a law linking\nthem and also thinks that there is a law linking two events just in\ncase they are constantly conjoined. Reid's first objection\nshows that it is not the case that wherever there is no constant\nconjunction there is no law. His second objection shows that\nit is not the case that wherever there is constant conjunction there\nis a law. Constant conjunction is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nthe presence of a genuine law. The hard problem that remains for the\nHumean, then, is to produce criteria for distinguishing genuine laws\nfrom regularities that are not laws at all.\n\n \nThese criticisms lead Reid to hold that there is a legitimate causal\nrelation between two events whenever the two are conjoined by a law of\nnature, even if laws of nature do not simply amount to constant\nconjunctions. He uses the term physical causation to refer to\nthe relation that holds between two events just in case they are\nconjoined by natural law. He takes the discovery of the physical\ncauses of phenomena to be central both to the sciences and to ordinary\nlife (see IHM 6.12, 122; EAP 1.5, 28\u20139; EAP 4.3, 211\u20132). But he also\nholds that genuine causation, what he calls efficient\ncausation, is not reducible to physical causation. The reason is\nthat, for him, a law of nature is not a brute conjunction between\nevents. Rather, it is a regularity in the behavior of the efficient\ncause of observed phenomena. Consistent with remarks above\n(see 1.2 Newtonianism and Empiricism), Reid\nwrites,\n[S]upposing that all the phenomena that fall within the\nreach of our senses, were accounted for from the general laws of\nnature, justly deduced from experience; that is, supposing natural\nphilosophy brought to its utmost perfection, it does not discover the\nefficient cause of any one phenomenon in nature. The laws of nature\nare the rules according to which the effects are produced; but there\nmust be a cause which operates according to these rules. The rules of\nnavigation never navigated a ship. The rules of architecture never\nbuilt a house. (EAP 1.6, 38)\n\n\nIt is a law that unsupported objects close to the earth will\nfall. What this means, Reid thinks, is that the physical cause of the\nfall of an object regularly causes objects to fall when they are\nunsupported. Physical causation, for him, is parasitic upon the more\nbasic kind of causation, namely efficient causation. But what is\nefficient causation? Reid writes, \u201cIn the strict and proper\nsense, I take an efficient cause to be a being who had power to\nproduce the effect, and exerted that power for that purpose\u201d\n(Letter to James Gregory, in Correspondence 174). Efficient\ncausation is necessitation of the sort that Hume thought not to\nexist. To efficiently cause an event is to be capable of seeing to it\nthat the event occurs, and to make an effort to see to it that it\ndoes. Thus, at the bottom of Reid's theory of causation are his\nnotions of power and exertion.\n",
