    "main_text": "\n\nArguably the most important German thinker of fifteenth century,\nNicholas of Cusa (1401\u20131464) was also an ecclesiastical\nreformer, administrator and cardinal. His life-long effort was to\nreform and unite the universal and Roman Church, whether as canon law\nexpert at the Council of Basel and after, as legate to Constantinople\nand later to German dioceses and houses of religion, as bishop in his\nown diocese of Brixen, and as advisor in the papal curia. His active\nlife as a Church administrator and bishop found written expression in\nseveral hundred Latin sermons and more theoretical background in his\nwritings on ecclesiology, ecumenism, mathematics, philosophy and\ntheology. Cusanus had an open and curious mind. He was learned and\nsteeped in the Neoplatonic tradition, well aware of both humanist and\nscholastic learning, yet mostly self-taught in philosophy and\ntheology. Nicholas anticipated many later ideas in mathematics,\ncosmology, astronomy and experimental science while constructing his\nown original version of systematic Neoplatonism. A whole range of\nearlier medieval writers, such as Thierry of Chartre, Ramon Llull and\nAlbert the Great, influenced Nicholas, but his important intellectual\nroots are in Proclus and Dionysius the Areopagite. In spite of his\nsignificance few later thinkers, apart from Giordano Bruno, understood\nor were influenced by him until the late nineteenth century.\n",
