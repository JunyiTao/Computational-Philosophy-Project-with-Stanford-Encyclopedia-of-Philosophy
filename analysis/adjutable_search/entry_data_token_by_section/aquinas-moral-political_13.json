    "main_text": "Moral principles || Moral precepts are further specifications of this master principle and its immediate specifications\n3.3 Moral precepts are further specifications of this master principle and its immediate specifications\n\nAll moral principles and norms, Aquinas thinks, can be inferred\n\u2013 as either implicit in, or \u201creferable to\u201d as\nconclusions from \u2013 the moral first principle of love of neighbor\nas self: ST I-II q. 99 a. 1 ad 2 with q. 91 a. 4c and q. 100\na. 2 ad 2; q. 100 aa. 3 and 11c. But he never displays an example or\nschema of these deduction-like inferences. Consequently, as noted in\n2.7 above, his would-be successors have sometimes proposed that moral\nprinciples and norms have the self-evidence of first principles, and\nsometimes, equally desperately, have offered premises which, though\nsuggested by some of Aquinas\u2019s argumentation or remarks, are\nincoherent with his general theory \u2013 e.g. that natural functions\nare not to be frustrated.\n\nThe main lines of Aquinas\u2019 theory of moral principles strongly\nsuggest that moral norms (precepts, standards) are specifications of\n\u201cGood is to be done and pursued, and evil avoided\u201d,\nspecifications which so direct choice and action that each of the\nprimary goods (elements of human fulfillment) will be respected and\npromoted to the extent required by the good of practical\nreasonableness (bonum rationis). And what practical\nreasonableness requires seems to be that each of the basic human goods\nbe treated as what it truly is: a basic reason for action amongst\nother basic reasons whose integral directiveness is not to be\ncut down or deflected by subrational passions. The principle of love\nof neighbor as self and the Golden Rule immediately pick out one\nelement in that integral directiveness. The other framework moral\nrules give moral direction by stating ways in which more or less\nspecific types of choice are immediately or mediately\ncontrary to some basic good. This appears to be Aquinas\u2019s\nimplicit method, as illustrated below (3.4).\n\nAn adequate exposition and defence of the moral norms upheld by\nAquinas requires a critique, only hints for which can be found in his\nwork, of theories which claim that choice can and should rationally be\nguided by a utilitarian, consequentialist or proportionalist master\nprinciple calling for maximizing of overall net good (or, some say,\nincompatibly, for minimizing net evils). In developments of\nAquinas\u2019s moral theory such as are proposed by Grisez and\nFinnis, that critique is treated as an indispensable preliminary to\nany reflective non-question-begging identification of the route from\nfirst principles to specific moral norms.\n",
