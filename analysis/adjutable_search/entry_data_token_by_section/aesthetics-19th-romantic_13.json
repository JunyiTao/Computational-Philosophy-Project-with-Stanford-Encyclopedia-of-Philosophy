    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Ethics and Politics || Political Community\n4.4 Political Community\n\nWhile sociality and communal spirit are ethically required for the\nachievement of autonomy and Bildung, community was also a\nromantic political ideal. Such an ideal required that what\nthe romantics viewed as modern alienation\u2014estrangement of the\nself from others\u2014be challenged in three ways: by promoting love\n(as discussed above), developing a sphere of free social interaction\nand pursuing a holistic, social unity.\n\nThe ideal political community must facilitate a sphere of social life,\nwhich is free and independent of political control because free\nsociality and conversation, the ends of this sphere, are both valuable\nin themselves and the best alternative for external laws. The\nromantics believed that social bonds should not be upheld by laws that\nare imposed on individual citizens from outside, but by the love\nencouraged by a common culture and free interaction. Romantic poetry\nis an exemplary model for achieving such a free domain since it is\n\u201ca republican speech\u2026in which all the parts are free\ncitizens and have the right to vote\u201d (Schlegel, CF: #65).\n\nAesthetics is at the center of this political vision also because the\npolitical ends of free sociability and conversation are the very same\nones that the romantics practiced in their intellectual-artistic\nsalons and in their communal, cooperative aesthetic projects. The\npolitical community should allow for creative and artistic endeavors\nsuch as the Athenaeum journal, which was the mouthpiece of\nthe German romantics at the end of the eighteenth century and a\njournal that was independent of the control of the publishing\nestablishment. It was written in collaboration (mainly by the Schlegel\nbrothers, Novalis, and Schleiermacher), and aimed at rational\ncriticism and Bildung. Such aesthetic projects are a model\nfor the politician. This is because \u201csympoetry\u201d and\n\u201csymphilosophy\u201d, as Schlegel and Novalis called such\ncooperative intellectual and aesthetic projects, should be an integral\npart of political life:\n\n\nPerhaps a whole new epoch of science and art would be inaugurated were\nsymphilosophy and sympoetry to become so common and deeply felt that\nthere would be nothing odd were several people of mutually\ncomplementary natures to create works in communion with each other.\n(F. Schlegel, AF: #125)\n\n\nThe ideal political community must also be characterized by a specific\nkind of relation between the political body as a whole and its\nmembers: the state should be an organic or holistic whole, which means\nmost broadly that the state as a whole must be prior to the parts (see\nBeiser 1992).\n\nFirst, the best state is prior to its parts since, as we saw, it is\nnecessary for individual identity and self-realization.\n\nAdditionally, the romantic community as a whole is prior to the\nindividual citizens (i.e., its parts), insofar as genuine social bonds\nand a well-functioning political entity cannot be\n\u201cconstructed\u201d out of separate self-sufficient and\nself-interested individuals (as the modern social contract theory has\nit). To properly function and achieve the ethical aim of sociality,\nthe links between the political members should be organic: the members\nshould not be connected to one another by an externally imposed social\ncontract, but by natural love, affection and attraction.\nUnsurprisingly, it is through poetry that the familial-like bonds,\nrequired for the ideal state, should be developed over and above the\nunit of the biological family. \u201cWithin the family, minds become\norganically one, and for this reason, the family is total\npoetry\u201d (F. Schlegel, Ideas: #152).\n\nWhile the state as a whole should be prior to its parts in this\nsense, the law of such a state should not be imposed on its\ncitizens from outside, but be self-determined. Individual\nautonomy should be supported by promoting the direct and active\nparticipation of all individuals in the political process. The organic\nunity of the state, then, implies reciprocity: the parts are\ndependent on and are posterior to the whole, while the whole, in\nrespect of its essential self-determination, also depends on and is\nposterior to its parts.\n\nThe work of art provides, once again, the structural model for this\npolitical ideal by virtue of its organic unity, where \u201cevery\nwhole can be a part and every part really a whole\u201d (Schlegel,\nCF: #14). When genuine, art is characterized exactly by the kind of\nholistic, organic, but egalitarian and pluralistic unity that must\ncharacterize the ideal community:\n\n\nMany works that are praised for the beauty of their coherence have\nless unity than a motley heap of ideas simply animated by the ghost of\na spirit and aiming at a single purpose. What really holds the latter\ntogether is that free and equal fellowship in which, so the wise man\nassures us, the citizens of the perfect state will live at some future\ndate; it\u2019s that unqualifiedly social spirit\u2026. (F.\nSchlegel, CF: #103)\n\n\nAn organic state is called for also because the mechanistic structure\nof the modern state is responsible for the decline of religion. This\nstructure caused, according to the romantics, a form of\n\u201censlavement\u201d and a faith in materialism and\ninstrumentalism, both of which prevent people from cultivating their\nspirituality and relation to the divine. Both in their early and late\nphases, the romantics believed that poetry was the best way for\ninspiring spirituality and religiosity. \u201cEvery artist is a\nmediator for all other men\u201d, writes F. Schlegel (Ideas:\n#44), regarding this \u201cmediator\u201d as mediating between man\nand God. Schleiermacher confirms and develops this connection when\nsuggesting that poets are:\n\n\nthe true priests of the Highest\u2026. They place the heavenly and\neternal before them as an object of pleasure and unity, as the sole\ninexhaustible source of that toward which their poetry is directed.\nThey strive\u2026to ignite a love for the Highest\u2026This is the\nhigher priesthood that proclaims the inner meaning of all spiritual\nsecrets and speaks from the kingdom of God. (Schleiermacher, On\nReligion [translation modified]).\n\n\nIt is for these reasons that \u201cat the time of the republic, the\nartists will not be a special class\u201d (F. Schlegel, PF: #749). In\nsuch an ideal republic everyone must be an artist who, by means of the\npoetic spirit of love, is related to the other citizens as artists\nrelate to one another.\n",
