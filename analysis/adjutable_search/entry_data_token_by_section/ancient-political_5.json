    "main_text": "Socrates and Plato || Socratic Ethics and Politics\n3.1 Socratic Ethics and Politics\n\nSocrates seems to have been the first philosopher to treat\nethics\u2014as opposed to cosmology and physics\u2014as a distinct\narea of inquiry. Asserting in Plato\u2019s Apology (38a)\nthat \u201cthe unexamined life is not worth living,\u201d he pressed\nfor definitions of the virtues or excellences which were widely\nrecognized and claimed by his fellows, but which they found difficult\nto explain. As depicted by Plato, the search for such definitions led\ninvariably to a concern with knowledge of how best to live, as not\nonly one of the conventional virtues (in the form of wisdom) but also\nas underpinning, even constituting, them all. That elevation of\nknowledge in turn led Socrates to militate against the practices of\nrhetoric and judgment which animated political institutions of Athens\nsuch as the law-courts, Assembly and Council. Instead he posited the\nexistence, or at least the possibility, of political expertise,\nclaiming (in Plato\u2019s Gorgias) to be the one person in\nAthens who at least tried to pursue such a true politik\u00ea\ntechn\u00ea, a complex notion that can be understood as meaning\npolitics as a kind of professional expertise (Grg. 521d). The\nnotion of political knowledge limited to one or a few experts, as\nopposed to the embedded and networked knowledge produced and exercised\nby the whole d\u00eamos of Athens in their judgments and\npolitical roles (Ober 2008), struck at the central premises of\nAthenian democracy and those of Greek politics more generally (in\noligarchies, wealth rather than knowledge was the relevant criterion\nfor rule; in tyrannies, sheer power). Thus the nature of\nSocrates\u2019 concern with ethics led him directly into a form of\npolitical philosophizing. The relation between politics and knowledge,\nthe meaning of justice as a virtue, the value of the military courage\nwhich all Greek cities prized in their citizens, all seem to have been\ncentral topics of Socratic conversation.\n",
