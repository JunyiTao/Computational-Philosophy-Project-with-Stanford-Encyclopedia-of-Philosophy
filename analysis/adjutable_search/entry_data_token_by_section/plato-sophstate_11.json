    "main_text": "Not-Being and Being || The Distinction of Great Kinds\n5.3 The Distinction of Great Kinds\n\n\nIn the first part of this section (Sophist 254d\u2013255e),\nthe Stranger addresses question (1): Of what sort is each of the great\nkinds? He distinguishes each of the five kinds from one another,\nstarting with being, change, and rest. Change and rest, as opposites,\ndo not associate with each other; but being applies to both, since we\nsay that both of them are. Being must be a third kind distinct from\nthem, for if being, which applies to both opposites, were the same as\neither of them\u2014say change\u2014then when being applies to rest,\nby substitution rest would partake of its own opposite, which is\nimpossible (Sophist 254d, with 249e\u2013250c). The Stranger\nuses a similar argument to show that sameness and difference are\ndistinct from change and rest (Sophist\n254d\u2013255b). Furthermore, being is distinct from sameness. They\nhave to be different, because if they were not, when we say that\nchange and rest both are, we could substitute \u201care\u201d with\n\u201cthe same,\u201d and change would be the same as rest\n(Sophist 255b\u2013c). (Much more can be said about\nsameness: for discussion see, e.g., Lewis 1976, and de Vries\n1988.)\n\n\nFinally, the Stranger distinguishes difference from being. This \nargument introduces a crucial distinction between two senses or uses \nof \u201cis\u201d and deserves a separate subsection.\n",
