    "main_text": "Eranos and the Phenomenology of Religion\n5. Eranos and the Phenomenology of Religion\n\n\nIn the year 1933, on the suggestion of Rudolph Otto, the Dutch\nheiress Olga Froebe-Kapteyn initiated an annual conference on her\nestate near Ascona, Switzerland that became known as the Eranos\nConference. The goal of this gathering was to bring together scholars\nof different religious traditions to discuss themes related to religion\nand spirituality. Scholem attended many of these conferences, presented\nnumerous papers, and took part in the larger ecumenical discussions. In\nthe years Scholem attended, Carl Jung was a central figure and many of\nthe themes in the conferences reflected Jung's particular\ninterest in religious symbolism and mythology. Other important figures\nincluded Mircea Eliade, Henri Corbin, Karl Lowith, Gerhard van der\nLeeuw, Erich Neumann, and Paul Tillich. This conference proved to be an\nimportant outlet for Scholem to move beyond his more parochial studies\nin Israel and explore the areas of comparative religion and\nphenomenology that interested him in his youth. It also enabled him to\nreturn to a more cosmopolitan European and international setting and\npresent his more specific Hebraic research to a new audience. Scholem\npublished some of these essays in the conference's annual\nproceedings, the Eranos Yearbook, and some in German and\nEnglish journals. Other essays from Eranos appeared in a six-volume\ncollection entitled Judaica published in Germany between\n1963\u20131997. The best collection of some of these articles in English\nappears in On the Kabbalah and its Symbolism, 1965. In\nparticular \u201cReligious Authority and Mysticism,\u201d\n\u201cKabbalah and Myth,\u201d and \u201cTradition and New Creation\nin the Ritual of the Kabbalists\u201d represent Scholem's\nattempt to present his research to a non-specialist yet educated\naudience of scholars of religion and psychology. While some of his\nstudents claim that these essays do not make up an essential part of\nScholem's oeuvre, others claim that, in fact, these are some of\nthe richest and perhaps the most provocative dimensions of\nScholem's intellectual project. Combined with other essays such\nas \u201cTradition and Revelation as Religious Categories in\nJudaism\u201d these essays address larger questions of philosophy and\nphenomenology of religion as they relate to Kabbala that are not dealt\nwith in his more technical Hebrew essays. When later scholars reflect\non the intellectual trajectory of Scholem's project, these essays\nprove indispensable. Moreover, the relationships he cultivated from\nattending these conferences expanded his own thinking and, by\nextension, his reconstruction of the history of Kabbala.\n",
