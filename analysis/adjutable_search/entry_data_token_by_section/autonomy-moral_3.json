    "main_text": "Autonomy in Moral Philosophy\n2. Autonomy in Moral Philosophy\n\nAutonomy is central in certain moral frameworks, both as a model of\nthe moral person \u2014 the feature of the person by virtue of which\nshe is morally obligated \u2014 and as the aspect of persons which\ngrounds others\u2019 obligations to her or him. For Kant, the\nself-imposition of universal moral law is the ground of both moral\nobligation generally and the respect others owe to us (and we owe\nourselves). In short, practical reason \u2014 our ability to use\nreasons to choose our own actions \u2014 presupposes that we\nunderstand ourselves as free. Freedom means lacking barriers to our\naction that are in any way external to our will, though it also\nrequires that we utilize a law to guide our decisions, a law that can\ncome to us only by an act of our own will (for further discussion see\nHill 1989; for doubts about this reading, see Kleingeld and Willaschek\n2019). This self-imposition of the moral law is autonomy. And since\nthis law must have no content provided by sense or desire, or any\nother contingent aspect of our situation, it must be universal. Hence\nwe have the (first formulation of the) Categorical Imperative, that by\nvirtue of our being autonomous we must act only on those maxims that\nwe can consistently will as a universal law.\n\nThe story continues, however: for the claim is that this capacity (to\nimpose upon ourselves the moral law) is the ultimate source of all\nmoral value \u2014 for to value anything (instrumentally or\nintrinsically) implies the ability to make value judgments generally,\nthe most fundamental of which is the determination of what is\nmorally valuable. Some theorists who are not (self-described)\nKantians have made this inference central to their views of autonomy.\nPaul Benson, for example, has argued that being autonomous implies a\nmeasure of self-worth in that we must be in a position to trust our\ndecision-making capacities to put ourselves in a position of\nresponsibility (Benson 1994; cf. also Grovier 1993, Lehrer 1997, and\nWestlund 2014). But the Kantian position is that such self-regard is\nnot a contingent psychological fact about us, but an unavoidable\nimplication of the exercise of practical reason (cf. Taylor 2005).\n\nSo we owe to ourselves moral respect in virtue of our autonomy. But\ninsofar as this capacity depends in no way on anything particular or\ncontingent about ourselves, we owe similar respect to all other\npersons in virtue of their capacity. Hence (via the second formulation\nof the Categorical Imperative), we are obliged to act out of\nfundamental respect for other persons in virtue of their autonomy. In\nthis way, autonomy serves as both a model of practical reason in the\ndetermination of moral obligation and as the feature of other persons\ndeserving moral respect from us. (For further discussion, see\nImmanual Kant and moral philosophy.)\n\nRecent discussions of Kantian autonomy have downplayed the\ntranscendental nature of practical reason in this account (see, for\nexample, Herman 1993 and Hill 1991). For example, Christine Korsgaard\nfollows Kant in seeing our capacity for self-reflection as both the\nobject of respect and the seat of normativity generally. On her view,\nwe are all guided by what she calls a \u201cpractical\nidentity\u201d, a point of view which orients reflection on values\nand manifests an aspect of our self concept. But unlike Kant,\nKorsgaard argues that we have different practical identities that are\nthe source of our normative commitments, and not all of them are of\nfundamental moral worth. But the most general of such identities\n\u2014 that which makes us members of a kingdom of ends \u2014 is\nour moral identity, which yields universal duties and obligations\nindependent of contingent factors. Autonomy is the source of all\nobligations, whether moral or non-moral, since it is the capacity to\nimpose upon ourselves, by virtue of our practical identities,\nobligations to act (Korsgaard 1996).\n\nTraditional critiques of autonomy-based moral views, and Kant\u2019s\nin particular, have been mounted along various lines. I mention two\nhere, as they connect with issues concerning autonomy in social and\npolitical theory. The first concerns the way in which autonomy-based\nmoral theory grounds obligation in our cognitive abilities\nrather than in our emotions and affective connections (see, e.g.,\nWilliams 1985, Stocker 1976). The claim is that Kantian morality\nleaves too little room for the kinds of emotional reactions that are\nconstitutive of moral response in many situations: the obligations of\nparents for example concern not only what they do but the passions and\ncare they bring forth in doing it. To view obligation as arising from\nautonomy but understanding autonomy in a purely cognitive manner makes\nsuch an account vulnerable to this kind of charge.\n\nThe difficulty this criticism points to resides in the ambiguities of\nthe self-description that we might utilize in valuing our\n\u201chumanity\u201d \u2014 our capacity to obligate ourselves. For\nwe can reflect upon our decision-making capacities and value this\npositively (and fundamentally) but regard that \u201cself\u201d\nengaging the capacity in different ways. The Kantian model of such a\nself is of a pure cognizer \u2014 a reflective agent engaged in\npractical reason. But also involved in decision-making are our\npassions \u2014 emotions, desires, felt commitments, senses of\nattraction and aversion, alienation and comfort. These are both the\nobjects of our judgement and partly constitutive of them \u2014 to\npassionately embrace an option is different from cooly determining it\nto be best. Judgment is involved with all such passions when decisions\nare made. And it (judgment) need not be understood apart from them,\nbut as an ability to engage in those actions whose passionate and\nreasoned support we muster up. So when the optimal decision for me is\nan impassioned one, I must value my ability to engage in the right\npassions, not merely in the ability to cold-heartedly reflect and\nchoose. Putting the passions outside the scope of reasoned reflection,\nas merely an ancillary quality of the action \u2014 to consider how\nto do something not merely what we are doing \u2014 is to make one\nkind of decision. Putting passions inside that scope \u2014 saying\nthat what it is right to do now is to act with a certain affect or\npassion \u2014 is another. When we generalize from our ability to\nmake the latter sort of decisions, we must value not only the ability\nto weigh options and universalize them but also the ability to engage\nthe right affect, emotion, etc. Therefore, we value ourselves and\nothers as passionate reasoners not merely reasoners per se.\n\nThe implication of this observation is that in generalizing our\njudgments in the manner Korsgaard (following Kant) says we must, we\nneed not commit ourselves to valuing only the cognitive capacities of\nhumanity but also its (relatively) subjective elements. \n\nA second question is this: since the reflection that is involved in\nautonomy (and which, according to this view, is the source of\nnormativity) need only be hypothetical reflection upon\none\u2019s desires and mental capacities, then the question arises:\nunder what conditions is this hypothetical reflection meant to take\nplace? If the capacity for reflection is the seat of obligation, then\nwe must ask if the conditions under which such hypothetical reflection\ntakes place are idealized in any sense \u2014 if they are assumed to\nbe reasonable for example. Are we considering merely the reflections\nthe (actual) person would make were she to turn her attention to the\nquestion, no matter how unreasonable such reflections might be? If so,\nwhy should we think this grounds obligations? If we assume they are\nreasonable, then under some conditions moral obligations are not\nimposed by the actual self but rather by an idealized, more rational\nself. This implies that morality is not literally self-imposed if by\n\u201cself\u201d one means the actual set of judgments made by the\nagent in question. Indeed, a Platonist/realist about moral value could\nclaim that the objective values which (according to the theory) apply\nto all agents independent of choice are in fact\n\u201cself-imposed\u201d in this idealized sense: they would be\nimposed were the person to reflect on the matter, acting as a\nperfectly reasonable agent. This shows the complex and potentially\nproblematic implications of this ambiguity.\n\nThis points to the question of whether autonomy can be the seat of\nmoral obligation and respect if autonomy is conceived in a purely\nprocedural manner. If no substantive commitments or value orientations\nare included in the conceptual specification of autonomy, then it is\nunclear how this capacity grounds any particular substantive value\ncommitments. On the other hand, if autonomy includes a specification\nof particular values in its conditions \u2014 that the autonomous\nperson must value her own freedom for example \u2014 then it turns\nout that moral obligation (and respect) attaches only to those already\ncommitted in this way, and not more generally to all rational agents\nas such (as traditionally advertised by the view). This echoes, of\ncourse, Hegel\u2019s critique of Kant.\n\nThese difficulties point to ambiguities in autonomy-based moral views,\nones which may well be clarified in further developments of those\ntheories. They also pick up on traditional problems with Kantian\nethics (though there are many other such difficulties not mentioned\nhere). Before leaving moral philosophy, we should consider ethical\nviews which focus on autonomy but which do not depend directly on a\nKantian framework.\n",
