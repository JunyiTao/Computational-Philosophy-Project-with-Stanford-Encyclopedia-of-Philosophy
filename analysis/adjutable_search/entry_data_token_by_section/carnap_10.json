    "main_text": "Toward the Aufbau || The Aufbau Program\n2.3 The Aufbau Program\n\nA series of notes taken during this period exhibit Carnap\u2019s\npreoccupation with the question how the system of knowledge could,\nunlike the proposals of Diderot and d\u2019Alembert in the\nEncyclop\u00e9die and those in its wake such as\nComte\u2019s and Ostwald\u2019s (1914a, 1914b), be unified\ndeductively, as Leibniz\u2014and Frege\u2014had envisaged\n(on Ostwald as a starting point for Carnap during this period, see\nDahms 2016). What especially preoccupied the young Carnap was the\nchallenge of giving the system empiricist underpinnings, i.e., finding\ndeductive relations between sense perceptions and the abstract\nconcepts of the advanced sciences. For a year or two he struggled with\nthis problem without success, until finally, in early 1922, just\nbefore the publication of Der Raum, Carnap read Bertrand\nRussell\u2019s Our Knowledge of the External World (1914).\nHere he found his answer\u2014the concepts were to be derived not by\nanalysis of experience, and deduction from the resulting\nelements, but by construction, using a \u201cprinciple of\nabstraction\u201d (Russell 1914a: 44\u201345; see also Pincock\n2002). Experiences could be gathered into equivalence classes, and for\npurposes of constructing a \u201creal\u201d world, each such class\ncan be regarded as a concept, defined by its extension. Immediate,\nmomentary experience\u2014the basis for knowledge among positivists,\nphenomenologists, as well as fictionalists such as the German\nphilosopher Hans Vaihinger\u2014need not be transcended in such a\nconstruction. The hitherto insurmountable problem of forcing the fluid\ncharacter of lived experience into the straitjacket of deductive\nrelations disappears.\n\nThis move also overcame another traditional positivist and\nphenomenological obstacle to Carnap\u2019s project of a Leibnizian,\ndeductive system of knowledge, formulated most drastically by Hans\nVaihinger (who influenced Carnap in this regard): the\n\u201cchaos\u201d of subjective experience, as we immediately\nexperience it, has no structure whatever. Nothing is really\n\u201cgiven\u201d but the undifferentiated chaos itself. No\ndistinguishable \u201celements\u201d present themselves as naturally\nisolable from it or as inherently available, without externally\nimposed fictions. Russell\u2019s principle of abstraction\u2014his\nmethod of substituting \u201clogical constructions for inferred\nentities\u201d (such as qualities)\u2014solved this problem, but\nwith the addition of a small but indispensable contribution from\nphenomenology. What enabled Carnap to obtain the elements he sought\nwithout isolating identifiable elements within the\nundifferentiated \u201cchaos\u201d was a single act of\nphenomenological discernment: a partition of the entire\n\u201cchaos\u201d into just two sectors, which he called the\n\u201cliving\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d components of experience.\nThis one distinction allowed Carnap to arrange experiences into a\ntemporal sequence (\u201cdead\u201d experience is past;\n\u201cliving\u201d experience present), making it possible to\nidentify holistic temporal cross-sections of experience, in which the\ntotal experience of a given specious present remains intact as a\nmomentary whole. This chronological sequence of experiential\ntime-slices now gave Carnap the basic framework he needed for\nidentifying qualities as cross-temporal equivalence classes of\ndiscernable persistences across series of adjacent specious presents.\nThese holistic time-slices did not need to be analysed.\nQualities and qualitative relations could, rather, be\nconstructed as something like equivalence classes of\nsufficiently \u201csimilar\u201d persistences across a series of\nadjacent time-slices (up to any desired degree of precision in\n\u201csimilarity\u201d). The result was that what empiricists such\nas Hume or Mach had always hoped to achieve by \u201canalysis of the\nsensations\u201d could be achieved without analysis. Carnap\ncalled it \u201cquasianalysis\u201d (which is explained in more\ndetail in the supplement\n Methodology (Section 3)).\n Physical objects could be constructed as connected classes of\nqualities, and from objects the path to a \u201creality\u201d seemed\nclear.\n\nIn this early stage of what became the Aufbau project, Carnap\nstill followed Vaihinger in distinguishing sharply between the direct,\ngenuine, first-hand knowledge of the \u201cchaos\u201d and the\nfictive, constructed nature of \u201creality\u201d. But he put the\nboundary between them in a different place. This was because\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology offered an escape route from\nVaihinger\u2019s completely undifferentiated chaos. It yielded\ncertain distinctions within the chaos (e.g., between\n\u201cliving\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d experience) that could\nclaim a degree of objectivity. These distinctions, Carnap then\nthought, were not fictional, but actually extended the range\nof what could be genuinely known, even without fictions, just\nfrom the chaos itself. So Carnap\u2019s boundary between the\nimmediately known primary world (of sensory\n\u201cchaos\u201d plus a minimal, phenomenologically extrapolated\nstructure) and a fictive secondary world of\n\u201creality\u201d included more in the \u201cprimary\u201d\nsector than Vaihinger\u2019s. Carnap thought he could show on\nphenomenological grounds that the primary world is two-dimensional in\nall sense modalities (Carnap 1924). So the boundary between the fixed\nprimary world and the freely choosable secondary worlds\n(\u201crealities\u201d) was located at the ascent from two to three\ndimensions. Within the primary world, the construction proceeded\nentirely by explicit definition, beginning from the qualities obtained\nby quasianalysis. Secondary worlds, by contrast, are not uniquely\ndetermined. The construction of a secondary world proceeds, rather, by\noptimizing its fit to whichever fictions are chosen to guide the\nconstruction, subject to the constraint of the (fixed) primary\nworld.\n\nCarnap remained as radically pragmatist about the choice among\nfictions to guide this ascent as Vaihinger; the choice of fictions was\nentirely practical and purpose-relative. (For more on\nVaihinger\u2019s account of fictions, see, e.g., Chapter 1 of Appiah\n2017.) To obtain the scientific secondary world, Carnap\nmaintained, we need only two fictions, corresponding roughly to\nKant\u2019s categories of cause and substance: a principle of\ninduction (or uniformity of nature) and a principle of\n\u201ccontinuity\u201d (as Mach had called it), requiring certain\nclusters of perceptions, such as those grouped into a \u201cphysical\nobject\u201d, to remain constant, under certain conditions, while we\nare not perceiving them.\n\nSometime during 1924, the Aufbau project changed course\ndrastically, and arrived at essentially its later published form\n(Carus 2016). The phenomenological approach to the basis was dropped;\na fixed \u201cprimary world\u201d was no longer to be distinguished\nby phenomenological intimation from the various \u201csecondary\nworlds\u201d built upon it. Russell\u2019s \u201cconstruction\nprinciple\u201d, as Carnap called it, came to dominate the project,\nand would become the book\u2019s epigraph:\n\n\nThe supreme maxim in scientific philosophizing is this: Wherever\npossible, logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred\nentities. (B. Russell 1914a: 155)\n\n\nSo now the two-dimensionality of perceptual space, for instance, is no\nlonger obtainable from phenomenological discernment, but becomes as\nmuch a logical construction as everything else (Aufbau:\n\u00a7\u00a789, 117, 124). And in a talk Carnap gave about the\nAufbau project in Vienna in January 1925, we find a new\nguiding principle: \u201cOvercoming subjectivity\u201d (Carnap\n1925a, 1925b, as quoted in Carus 2007a: 168; 2016).\n",
