    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || Broad Multiverse Views\n4.1 Broad Multiverse Views\nThe pluralist is generally a non-pluralist about certain domains of\nmathematics. For example, a strict finitist might be a non-pluralist\nabout PA but a pluralist about set theory and one might be a\nnon-pluralist about ZFC and a pluralist about large cardinal axioms\nand statements like CH. \n There is a form of radical pluralism which advocates pluralism\nconcerning all domains of mathematics. On this view any consistent\ntheory is a legitimate candidate and the corresponding models of such\ntheories are legitimate candidates for the domain of\nmathematics. Let us call this the broadest multiverse\nview. There is a difficulty in articulating this view, which may be\nbrought out as follows: To begin with, one must pick a background\ntheory in which to discuss the various models and this leads to a\ndifficult. For example, according to the broad multiverse conception,\nsince PA cannot prove Con(PA) (by the second incompleteness theorem,\nassuming that PA is consistent) there are models of PA + \u00acCon(PA)\nand these models are legitimate candidates, that is, they are\nuniverses within the broad multiverse. Now to arrive at this\nconclusion one must (in the background theory) be in a position to\nprove Con(PA) (since this assumption is required to apply the second\nincompleteness theorem in this particular case). Thus, from the\nperspective of the background theory used to argue that the above\nmodels are legitimate candidates, the models in question satisfy a\nfalse\n\u03a301-sentence,\nnamely, \u00acCon(PA). In short, there is a lack of harmony between\nwhat is held at the meta-level and what is held at the\nobject-level. \n The only way out of this difficulty would seem to be to regard\neach viewpoint\u2014each articulation of the multiverse\nconception\u2014as provisional and, when pressed, embrace pluralism\nconcerning the background theory. In other words, one would have to\nadopt a multiverse conception of the multiverse, a multiverse\nconception of the multiverse conception of the multiverse, and so on,\noff to infinity. It follows that such a position can never be fully\narticulated\u2014each time one attempts to articulate the broad\nmultiverse conception one must employ a background theory but since\none is a pluralist about that background theory this pass at using the\nbroad multiverse to articulate the conception does not do the\nconception full justice. The position is thus difficult to\narticulate. One can certainly take the pluralist stance and\ntry to gesture toward or exhibit the view that one\nintends by provisionally settling on a particular background theory\nbut then advocate pluralism regarding that when pressed. The\nview is thus something of a \u201cmoving target\u201d. We shall pass\nover this view in silence and concentrate on views that can be\narticulated within a foundational framework. \n We will accordingly look at views which embrace non-pluralism with\nregard to a given stretch of mathematics and for reasons of space and\nbecause this is an entry on set theory we will pass over the long\ndebates concerning strict finitism, finitism, predicativism, and start\nwith views that embrace non-pluralism regarding ZFC. \n Let the broad multiverse (based on ZFC) be the collection\nof all models of ZFC. The broad multiverse conception of truth (based\non ZFC) is then simply the view that a statement of set theory is true\nsimpliciter if it is provable in ZFC. On this view the statement\nCon(ZFC) and other undecided\n\u03a001-statements\nare classified as indeterminate. This view thus faces a difficulty\nparallel to the one mentioned above concerning radical pluralism. \n This motivates the shift to views that narrow the class of\nuniverses in the multiverse by employing a strong logic. For example,\none can restrict to universes that are \u03c9-models, \u03b2-models\n(i.e., wellfounded), etc. On the view where one takes \u03c9-models,\nthe statement Con(ZFC) is classified as true (though this is sensitive\nto the background theory) but the statement PM (all projective sets\nare Lebesgue measurable) is classified as indeterminate. \n For those who are convinced by the arguments (surveyed in the\nentry \n \u201cLarge Cardinals and Determinacy\u201d)\nfor large\ncardinal axioms and axioms of definable determinacy, even these\nmultiverse conceptions are too weak. We will follow this route. For\nthe rest of this entry we will embrace non-pluralism concerning large\ncardinal axioms and axioms of definable determinacy and focus on the\nquestion of CH. \n",
