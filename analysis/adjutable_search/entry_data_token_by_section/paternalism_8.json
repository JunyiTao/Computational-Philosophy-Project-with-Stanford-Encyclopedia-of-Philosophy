    "main_text": "Libertarian Paternalism\n4. Libertarian Paternalism\n\nIn recent years there has been a new, influential, strand of thought\nabout paternalistic interferences. It has been referred to as New\nPaternalism or Libertarian Paternalism. It is influenced by research\nin the behavioral sciences on the many ways in which our cognitive and\naffective capacities are flawed and limited.\n\nThe first theorists to emphasize these findings for making social\npolicy were the Nudgers\u2014Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler (2003).\nThey argued that since people were such bad decision makers we should\nnudge them in the direction of their own desired goals by\norchestrating their choices so that they are more likely to do what\nachieves their ends.\n\nThe claim is that, unlike traditional paternalism which rules out\nchoices by compulsion or adds costs to the choices by coercion, nudges\nsimply change the presentation of the choices in such a way that\npeople were more likely to choose options that are best for them. In\naddition they argue that any arrangement of choices will make some\nchoices more or less likely so that some decision about the choice\narchitecture is inevitable.\n\nThe first issue is what exactly distinguishes Nudges from other ways\nof influencing people\u2019s choices. Here are various examples of\nNudges. These were given in the earliest discussions of nudging and\nhave tended to be the ones focused on.\n\nCafeteria. In order to influence students to make healthier\nfood choices as they pass the cafeteria options place the healthy\nfoods at eye level and place the less healthy choices higher or lower\nthan eye level. Sometimes the nudge involves putting the healthful\nfood earlier in the line.\n\nOpt-In vs Opt-Out. Given that many employees often fail to\nenroll (opt-in) in retirement plans, employers make the default\nautomatic enrollment in such programs, allowing employees to easily\nopt-out. Such programs have been shown to increase savings rates.\n\nSave More Tomorrow. Employees are asked to commit now to\nhaving a portion of their salary increase in subsequent years put\ndirectly into their pension plan. People are loss averse, and thus\nmore willing to forgo a raise in take-home income than they are to\nactively re-direct the additional funds they have already received to\ntheir retirement accounts each year.\n\nSize of Plates. Using smaller plates in a cafeteria cuts down\non the amount of food consumed.\n\nPainting Traffic Lanes. In order to get drivers to slow down\non a sharp turn the lane lines are painted closer together than usual.\nThis creates the illusion for the drivers that they are driving faster\nthan they actually are and they slow down as a result.\n\nThe initial examples above served as the focus of much of the early\nliterature. The early critics attempted to distinguish interventions\nsuch as Cafeteria from interventions such as merely providing\ninformation. It is clear from more recent writings that the category\nof nudges is intended to be quite broad. According to Sunstein all the\nfollowing are nudges: reminders, warnings, a GPS, disclosure of the\ninterest rate of a bank card, any information about what people like\nyou do, simplification of government forms, default rules, subliminal\nmessages urging people to eat healthy food.\n\nThaler and Sunstein also provided a characterization of a nudge as\n\n\n\nany aspect of the choice architecture that alters people\u2019s\nbehavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or\nsignificantly changing their economic incentive.
