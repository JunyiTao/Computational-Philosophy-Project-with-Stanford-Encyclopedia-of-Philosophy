    "main_text": "Perception and Knowledge of the World || Primary and Secondary Qualities\n3.4 Primary and Secondary Qualities\n\n\nIntertwined with Reid's arguments that we can be immediately aware of\nobjects through their relational properties\u2014such as their\napparent magnitudes\u2014are Reid's arguments regarding the\ndistinction between primary and secondary qualities. As we would\nexpect, Reid approaches this distinction as a scientist of the mind\nrather than as a metaphysician, and, as we would also expect, Reid's\nentrance into this terrain is paved with references to earlier\nthinkers.\n\n \nLocke thought that our ideas of \u201cprimary\nqualities\u201d\u2014shapes, sizes, motions, textures and physical\nconstruction\u2014resemble the qualities which cause them. However,\naccording to Locke, our ideas of a variety of other\nqualities\u2014colors, sounds, tastes and smells\u2014do not. Ideas\nof colors, sounds, tastes and smells, or \u201csecondary\nqualities,\u201d are caused by certain complex configurations of\nprimary qualities that bear no resemblance to the ideas which they\ncause. Reid is deeply struck by Berkeley's attack on this distinction\nat Principles of Human Knowledge 1.9\u201315. He agrees\nwith Berkeley that no mental state or object could possibly resemble\nanything that is not, itself, a mental state or object. In Berkeley's\nfamous words, \u201cAn idea can be like nothing but an idea\u201d\n(Principles of Human Knowledge 1.8). Mental states and\nobjects have only mental properties, but only something that is,\nitself, a mental state or object can have a mental property. Hence,\nnothing can resemble\u2014that is, share a property in common\nwith\u2014a mental state or object other than another mental state or\nobject. Berkeley took this point to show\nthat no non-mental cause of an idea could resemble\nit, whether the relevant idea were an idea of a shape or a\ncolor. Berkeley concludes that Locke's distinction between primary and\nsecondary qualities is a grand mistake.\n\n\nReid accepts, for roughly Berkeley's reasons, that sensations cannot\npossibly resemble their causes\u2014a fact that Reid deploys in his\nSensory Deprivation Argument discussed above. Further, he accepts\nBerkeley's objections to Locke, and takes them to show that no mental\nevents or states, whether sensations or the conceptions of objects\nthat follow them, could possibly resemble any non-mental\nobject. Another reason that Reid cannot draw the distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities in the way that Locke did is that he\ndenies that conceptions of objects which we have following sensory\nexperiences are to be analyzed as perceptions of ideas. Instead, these\nconceptions function to make us aware of qualities in objects that\ncaused the sensations. All of this would make it seem that Reid would\nsimply side with Berkeley and deny that there is any important\ndifference between primary qualities and qualities like colors,\nsounds, tastes and smells. Instead, Reid defends the distinction\nbetween primary and secondary qualities on grounds quite different\nfrom Locke's, grounds that he takes to be immune to Berkeley's\ncriticisms of the distinction.\n\n\nReid accepts that the qualities which we ordinarily conceive objects\nto have\u2014whether shapes, sizes and motions, on the one hand, or\ncolors, sounds, tastes and smells, on the other\u2014are genuinely\npossessed by those objects (barring illusions and disorders of various\nsorts, which are, incidentally, difficult for any direct theory of\nperception like Reid's to explain). He thinks that shapes, sizes and\nmotions are intrinsic properties of objects while colors, sounds,\ntastes and smells are relational properties of objects. But neither\nsecondary nor primary qualities resemble the sensory experiences that\nthey immediately cause in us. Colors, sounds, tastes and smells are\npowers to produce certain characteristic sensations in us in normal\nconditions. To believe that a rose has an agreeable smell or a red\ncolor is not to perceive any intrinsic qualities of the object, but\nis, rather, to perceive that the object bears a certain relation to\nsomething else\u2014our minds. Reid writes,\nThe object of my perception, in this case, is that quality\nin the rose which I discern by the sense of smell. Observing that the\nagreeable sensation is raised when the rose is near, and ceases when\nit is removed, I am led, by my nature, to conclude some quality to be\nin the rose, which is the cause of this sensation. This quality in the\nrose is the object perceived; and that act of my mind by which I have\nthe conviction and belief of this quality, is what in this case I call\nperception. (EIP 2.16, 194)\n\n\nPhysical structures of the rose in front of me\u2014the anther in the\nrose's stamen\u2014produce pollen, which has a certain molecular\ncomposition that results in my sensation of its odor. Other molecules\nin the petals of the rose reflect light at a certain wavelength which\nin turn causes in me a certain characteristic visual sensation of\nred. If I am speaking correctly when I say \u201cThat rose smells\ngood\u201d, I am reporting the fact that I conceive of the rose as\npossessing a particular relational property: I am aware that the rose\nhas the property of\nbeing-such-as-to-cause-in-me-sensations-of-a-sweet-smelling-odor. Ultimately,\nthe rose possesses this relational property because of facts about its\nmolecular structure that account for its producing this odor in a\ncertain way, and facts about me that account for the fact\nthat these pollen molecules enter my nasal cavity, eventually reaching\nthe olfactory bulb, and cause certain sensations in my mind. But when\nI am aware of the odor of the rose, I am aware of none of that; I am\naware only of the fact that there is something about the rose that\nmakes it cause in me certain sensations in normal conditions. \n\n\nOur conceptions of qualities such as smells and colors are to be\ncontrasted with our conceptions of primary qualities or configurations\nof primary qualities, such as hardness. Say I'm holding the rose's\nstem in my hand while I'm looking at it. I am having two importantly\ndifferent sensations: a visual sensation of red, and a tactile\nsensation of hardness. For Reid, neither sensation resembles anything\nin the object; both give rise to conceptions of the object as\npossessing certain properties. The visual sensation gives rise to a\nconception of the object as possessing a particular relational\nproperty: its power to produce certain sensations in me in normal\nconditions. The tactile sensation gives rise to a conception of the\nrose's stem as possessing a particular intrinsic property: the complex\nconfiguration of primary qualities that is hardness.\n\n\nFor both Locke and Reid, we are aware of objects as they are\nintrinsically only when our awareness is caused by the primary\nqualities of objects. But for Reid, and not for Locke, we are\ngenuinely aware of objects as they are when our awareness results from\nthe secondary qualities of objects; but we are aware of those objects\nonly as they are relative to us, and not as they\nare in themselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen a primary quality is perceived, the sensation immediately\nleads our thought to the quality signified by it, and is itself\nforgot.\u201d (EIP 2.17, 204)\n\n\n\u201c[T]here appears to be a real foundation for the distinction;\nand it is this\u2014that our senses give us a direct and a distinct\nnotion of the primary qualities, and inform us what they are in\nthemselves. But of the secondary qualities, our senses give us only a\nrelative and obscure notion. They inform us only, that they are\nqualities that affect us in a certain manner\u2014that is, produce in\nus a certain sensation; but as to what they are in themselves, our\nsenses leave us in the dark.\u201d (EIP 2.17, 201)\n\n\n\u201c[T]he sensations belonging to secondary qualities are an object\nof our attention, while those which belong to the primary are\nnot.\u201d (EIP 2.17, 204)\n\n\nSecondary and primary qualities are characterized by their relations\nto the mind perceiving them and to the physical qualities in objects\nthat they signify. Primary qualities stand out as qualities of which\nwe have \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cdistinct\u201d notions. This\nis not so for secondary qualities. To return to Reid's rose, he writes\nof the smell of the rose that\nI have a distinct notion of the sensation which it\nproduces in my mind. ... The quality in the rose is something which\noccasions the sensation in me; but what that something is, I know\nnot. My senses give me no information upon this point. The only\nnotion, therefore, my senses give is this\u2014that smell in the rose\nis an unknown quality or modification, which is the cause or occasion\nof a sensation which I know well. The relation which this unknown\nquality bears to the sensation with which nature hath connected it, is\nall I learn from the sense of smelling; but this is evidently a\nrelative notion. The same reasoning will apply to every secondary\nquality. (EIP 2.17, 202/314b)\n\n\nReid does defend a primary/secondary quality distinction, but,\nunusually, Reid's distinction is drawn not in metaphysical terms but\nin epistemic terms premised upon discussion of the differing\nways that secondary and primary qualities relate to our minds (Nichols\n2007, ch. 6).\n\n \nAn important note at this juncture is that Reid very infrequently uses\ncontemporary epistemological terms such as \u201cknowledge\u201d,\n\u201crational\u201d, or \u201cjustified\u201d, and even when he\ndoes, he does not offer necessary and sufficient conditions for their\ndefinition. Reid says above that sensations caused by primary\nqualities \u201cinform us\u201d of the qualities in the objects that\ncaused them. One ought not look to Reid's epistemology for a detailed\nformal apparatus clearly identifying his externalism about\njustification, for example, even though he can be credited with\nbringing what we now call externalism about justification into Early\nModern philosophy.\n",
