    "main_text": "Other Uses of Dutch Book Arguments || Dutch Books and Rational Choice\n5.3 Dutch Books and Rational Choice\n\nDutch Books have also been used to show that there are limitations on\nthe proper applications of credences within the standard decision\ntheoretic framework. Given that the available evidence often appears\nto dictate only vague or interval-valued credences, it has been argued\nthat rationality permits having such unsharp credences. Elga uses a\nkind of reverse Dutch Book involving a series of bets that are sure to\nresult in a net gain for the agent to argue that credences must be\nsharp (Elga 2010). The idea is that a rational agent must accept at\nleast one of the bets in the series, but that there does not appear to\nbe a satisfactory set of decision rules for unsharp credences with\nthis consequence.\n\nMcGee constructs another type of Dutch Book with implications for\ndecision theory. Suppose that an agent\u2019s probability function is\nnot concentrated at finitely many points. Such a state of opinion, in\nwhich the agent does not rule out all but a finite number of\npossibilities, seems both consistent and reasonable, yet assuming that\nan agent\u2019s utilities are unbounded, McGee shows that there is an\ninfinite series of bets, each with positive expected value, which\ntogether assure a loss (McGee 1999). Assuming that it is reasonable to\nhave probabilities that are not concentrated at finitely many points,\nMcGee calls into question the general adequacy of the decision\ntheoretic framework, and in particular the principle of utility\nmaximization that his Dutch Book argument presumes.\n",
