Robert Brandon (2005) argues that it \u201cdoes not map\nwell onto the ways biologists differentiate drift from\nselection\u201d (2005: 156), that selection and drift are the same\nprocess (i.e., sampling), and that the large majority of biological\ncases are not cases of indiscriminate sampling. He maintains that\n\u201cDrift is any deviation from the expected levels of reproduction\ndue to sampling error\u201d whereas \u201cSelection is differential\nreproduction that is due to (and in accord with) expected differences\nin reproductive success\u201d (2005: 168\u20139). These definitions\ninclude both process and outcome. Millstein (2005) responds\nto each of these challenges and defends her view over his. For the\npurposes of this essay, it is important to note, as Millstein (2005)\nacknowledges, that Brandon is certainly correct in his descriptive\nclaim that many biologists incorporate both process and outcome in\ntheir definitions of drift (see Millstein, Skipper, and Dietrich\n(2009) for examples). Indeed, the plurality of definitions of drift\noffered by contemporary biologists\u2014some process-oriented, some\noutcome-oriented, some both, and some alternating within the same\nwork\u2014gives rise to the need for philosophical analysis, even if\nthe result, in the end, is to accept that pluralism. The Causal\nProcess Account of Drift is making a prescriptive claim on the grounds\nof 1) increased clarity, 2) the ability to conceptually differentiate\nbiologically very different phenomena, such as selection in a\nfluctuating environment from fluctuating gene frequencies due to\nindiscriminate sampling, which have the same outcomes, while 3)\nmaintaining a grounding in biological practice and (some) biological\nusage.\n\nJessica Pfeifer (2005) weighs in on the disagreement between Millstein\nand Brandon, arguing that it is reasonable to think that the source of\nprobabilities in natural selection are at least partly a result of\nabstracting from or ignoring certain features of the environment and\nthat, if this view is adopted, it is not conceptually confused to\ntreat selection and drift as causally distinct. On Pfeifer\u2019s\nview, drift is caused by the distribution of ignored factors, whereas\nselection for the trait in question is caused by those features that\nare not ignored.\n\nPeter Gildenhuys (2009) argues that the term \u201cdrift\u201d is\nused to refer to causal influences over a population that have three\nfeatures: they are non-interactive, non-pervasive, and indiscriminate\n(NINPICs). Thus, he endorses drift as indiscriminate sampling; the\nother modifications he makes to the view seem to stem from thinking\nthat the Causal Process Account precludes drift and selection from\nco-occurring and from thinking the view needs to account for location\n(e.g., an organism being in the wrong place at the wrong time) as an\nirrelevant causal factor. In any case, he acknowledges that his\naccount and the Causal Process Account probably agree in practice over\nwhat sorts of things should be characterized as constituting drift.\nLarry Shapiro and Elliott Sober (2007) also endorse the view that\nselection and drift are distinct processes, but Sober, at least, has\nbacked off this view in a recent paper co-authored with Hayley\nClatterbuck and Richard Lewontin (Clatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin\n2013). Like Gildenhuys, they seem to suggest that if selection and\ndrift are distinct processes that they cannot co-occur, and they seem\nto think that the mere introduction of finite population size\nintroduces drift.\n\nTo be clear, however, there can be indiscriminate sampling processes\nand discriminate sampling processes occurring in the same population,\neven with respect to the same trait. For example, in a study of over\n900 populations, biologist Maxime Lamotte acknowledged that camouflage\ngave appropriately colored Cepaea nemoralis land snails a\nselective advantage in their respective environment while\nsimultaneously maintaining that foundings of new populations are\n\u201cof considerable importance because of the chance variations in\nthe composition of the first colonizers\u201d (Lamotte 1959: 80); the\nvariations he refers to are variations in the colors of the snail\ncolonizers (Millstein 2009). Moreover, since the Causal Process\nAccount requires that variations be heritable, the non-heritable\nlocations of organisms are simply irrelevant for the purposes of\ndeciding on drift vs. selection; for example, the founders of a new\npopulation may all hail from the geographic edge of the original\npopulation, but they can still be an indiscriminate sample of the\nwhole. Finally, historically, at least (as discussed above), small\npopulation size has always been associated with drift, but it was\nnever the main phenomenon to be represented. Thus, the variant\nsampling accounts of drift should be evaluated in light of these\nconsiderations.\n",
