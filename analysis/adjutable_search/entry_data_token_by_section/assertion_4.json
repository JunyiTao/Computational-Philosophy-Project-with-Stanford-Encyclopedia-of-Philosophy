A standard example of an indirect speech act is\ngiven by\n\n(13)\nCan you pass the salt?\n\n\nBy means of uttering an interrogative sentence the speaker requests\nthe addressee to pass the salt. The request is indirect. The question,\nliterally concerning the addressee\u2019s ability to pass the salt,\nis direct. As defined by John Searle (1975b: 59\u201360), and also by\nBach and Harnish (1979: 70), an indirect illocutionary act is\nsubordinate to another, more primary act and depends on the success of\nthe first. An alternative definition, given by Sadock (1974: 73), is\nthat an act is indirect just if it has a different illocutionary force\nfrom the one standardly correlated with the sentence-type used.\n\nExamples of indirect assertions by means of questions and\ncommands/requests are given by\n\n(14)\n\n\na.\nMay I tell you that, obviously, the square root of a quarter is a\nhalf?\nb.\nLet me tell you that, obviously, the square root of a quarter is a\nhalf!\n \n\n\n(Levinson 1983: 266). Rhetorical questions also have the force of\nassertions:\n\n(15)\nIs not Switzerland a peace-loving nation?\n\n\nAnother candidate type is irony:\n\n(16)\nSwitzerland is known for its aggressive foreign policy.\n\n\nassuming the speaker does mean the negation of what is literally said.\nHowever, although in a sense the act is indirect, since the speaker\nasserts something different from what she would do on a normal, direct\nuse of the sentence, and relies on the hearer to realize this, it is\nnot an indirect assertion by either definition. It isn\u2019t on the\nfirst, since the primary act (the literal assertion) isn\u2019t even\nmade, and it isn\u2019t on the second, since there is no discrepancy\nbetween force and sentence\n type.[8]\n\nThe very idea of indirect speech acts is, however, controversial. It\nis not universally agreed that an ordinary utterance of\n (13)\n is indirect, since it has been denied, e.g., by Levinson (1983:\n273\u20136) that a question has really been asked, over and above the\nrequest. Similarly, Levinson have questioned the idea of a standard\ncorrelation between force and sentence form, by which a request would\ncount as indirect on Sadock\u2019s criterion.\n\nCommon to all conceptions of indirect assertions is that they are not\nexplicit: what is expressed, or literally said, is not the same as\nwhat is asserted. One question is whether an utterance is an assertion\nproper that p if that content is not exactly what is\nexpressed, or whether it is an act of a related kind, perhaps an\n implicature.[9]\n",
