Logical fatalism: Diodorus Cronus and the necessity of the past\n\nDiodorus Cronus (late 4th \u2013 early 3rd centuries B.C.E.) had an\nargument for fatalism, known as \u201cThe Master Argument\u201d. Its\nconclusion was, \u201cthe possible is that which either is or will\nbe\u201d. We know the premisses but, unfortunately we do not know the\nintermediate steps. The premisses were (1) \u201cEverything that is\npast and true is necessary\u201d, (2) \u201cThe impossible does not\nfollow from the possible\u201d (Kneale and Kneale 1962, 119).\n\nI shall not try to reconstruct the way the argument actually went, but\nconsider an argument to it which might have been akin, which argues\nfor fatalism on the basis of the necessity of the past. The argument\ngoes:\n\n\nWhat is true of the past is necessary.\n\nSuppose that there is a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.\n\nThen it was true in 1900 that there would be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100.\n\nThen it was true of the past that there would be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100.\n\nSo it is necessary that there will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.\n\nTherefore, if there is a sea-battle on 1/1/2100, it is necessary that\nthere will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100 (and impossible that there\nshould not be).\n\n\nIs anything wrong with this argument?\n",
