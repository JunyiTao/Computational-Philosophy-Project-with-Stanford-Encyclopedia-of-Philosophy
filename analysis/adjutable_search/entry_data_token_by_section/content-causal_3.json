    "main_text": "Specific Causal Theories of Mental Content || Normal Conditions\n3.1 Normal Conditions\n\nTrees usually grow a certain way. Each year, there is the passage of\nthe four seasons with a tree growing more quickly at some times and\nmore slowly at others. As a result, each year a tree adds a\n\u201cring\u201d to its girth in such a way that one might say that\neach ring means a year of growth. If we find a tree stump that has\ntwelve rings, then that means that the tree was twelve years old when\nit died. But, it is not an entirely inviolable law that a tree grows a\nring each year. Such a law, if it is one, is at most a ceteris\nparibus law. It holds only given certain background conditions,\nsuch as that weather conditions are normal. If the weather conditions\nare especially bad one season, then perhaps the tree will not grow\nenough to produce a new ring. One might, therefore, propose that if\nconditions are normal, then n rings means that the tree was n years\nold when it died. This idea makes its first appearance when Stampe\n(1977) invokes it as part of his theory of \u201cfidelity\nconditions.\u201d\n\nAn appeal to normal conditions would seem to be an obvious way in\nwhich to bracket at least some non-content-determining causes of a\nwould-be mental representation \u201cX\u201d. It is only the causes\nthat operate under normal conditions that are content-determining. So,\nwhen it comes to human brains, under normal conditions one is not\nunder the influence of hallucinogens nor is one\u2019s head being\ninvaded by an elaborate configuration of microelectrodes. So, even\nthough LSD and microelectrodes would, counterfactually speaking, cause\na token neural event \u201cX\u201d, these causes would not be among\nthe content-determining causes of \u201cX\u201d. Moreover, one can\ntake normal conditions of viewing to include good lighting, a\nparticular perspective, a particular viewing distance, a lack of\n(seriously) occluding objects, and so forth, so that foxes in dim\nlight, viewed from the bottom up, at a remove of a mile, or through a\ndense fog, would not be among the content-determining causes of\n\u201cX\u201d. Under normal viewing conditions, one does not confuse\na fox with a dog, so foxes are not to be counted as part of the\ncontent of \u201cX\u201d. Moreover, if one does confuse a fox with a\ndog under normal viewing conditions, then perhaps one does not really\nhave a mental representation of a dog, but maybe only a mental\nrepresentation of a member of the taxonomic family canidae.\n\nAlthough an appeal to normal conditions initially appears promising,\nit does not seem to be sufficient to rule out the causal\nintermediaries between objects in the environment and \u201cX\u201d.\nEven under normal conditions of viewing that include good lighting, a\nparticular perspective, a particular viewing distance, a lack of\n(seriously) occluding objects, and so forth, it is still the case that\nboth dogs and, say, retinal projections of dogs, lead to tokens of\n\u201cX\u201d. Why does the content of \u201cX\u201d not include\nretinal projections of dogs or any of the other causal intermediaries?\nNor do normal conditions suffice to keep questions from getting in\namong the content-determining causes. What abnormal conditions are\nthere when the question, \u201cWhat kind of animal is named\n\u2018Fido\u2019?,\u201d leads to a tokening of an \u201cX\u201d\nwith the putative meaning of dog? Suppose there are instances of\nquantum mechanical fluctuations in the nervous system, wherein\nspontaneous changes in neurons lead to tokens of \u201cX\u201d. Do\nnormal conditions block these out? So, there are problem cases in\nwhich appeals to normal conditions do not seem to work. Fodor (1990b)\ndiscusses this problem with proximal stimulations in connection with\nhis asymmetric dependency theory, but it is one that clearly\nchallenges the causal theory plus normal conditions approach.\n\nNext, suppose that we tightly construe normal conditions to eliminate\nthe kinds of problem cases described above. So, when completely\nfleshed out, under normal conditions only dogs cause \u201cX\u201ds.\nWhat one intuitively wants is to be able to say that, under normal\nconditions of good lighting, proper viewing distance, etc.\n\u201cX\u201d means dog. But, another possibility is that in such a\nsituation \u201cX\u201d does not mean dog, but\ndog-under-normal-conditions-of-good-lighting, proper-viewing-distance,\netc. Why take one interpretation over another? One needs a principled\nbasis for distinguishing the cause of \u201cX\u201d from\nthe many causally contributing factors. In other words, we still have\nthe problem of bracketing non-content-determining causes, only in a\nslightly reformulated manner. This sort of objection may be found in\nFodor (1984).\n\nNow set the preceding problem aside. There is still another developed\nin Fodor (1984). Suppose that \u201cX\u201d does mean dog under\nconditions of good lighting, lack of serious occlusions, etc. Do not\nmerely suppose that \u201cX\u201d is caused by dogs under conditions\nof good light, lack of serious occlusions, etc.; grant that\n\u201cX\u201d really does mean dog under these conditions. Even\nthen, why does \u201cX\u201d, the firing of the neuronal circuit,\nstill mean dog, when those conditions do not hold? Why does\n\u201cX\u201d still mean dog under, say, degraded lighting\nconditions? After all, we could abide by another apparently true\nconditional regarding these other conditions, namely, if the lighting\nconditions were not so good, there were no serious occlusions, etc.,\nthen the neuronal circuit\u2019s firing would mean dog or fox. Even\nif \u201cX\u201d means X under one set of conditions C1,\nwhy doesn\u2019t \u201cX\u201d mean Y under a different set of\nconditions C2? It looks as though one could say that\nC1 provides normal conditions under which \u201cX\u201d\nmeans X and C2 provides normal conditions under which\n\u201cX\u201d means Y. We need some non-semantic notions to enable\nus to fix on one interpretation, rather than the other. At this point,\none might look to a notion of functions to solve these\n problems.[7]\n",
