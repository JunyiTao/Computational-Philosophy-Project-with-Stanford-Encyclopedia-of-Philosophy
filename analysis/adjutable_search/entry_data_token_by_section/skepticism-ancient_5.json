    "main_text": "Academic Skepticism || Carneades\n3.2 Carneades\n\nLike Arcesilaus, Carneades (214\u2013129/8 BCE) refrains from writing\nand philosophizes in a Socratic spirit. Carneades led an embassy of\nthree philosophers from Athens to Rome in 156/5 BCE. Aside from his\nofficial role, he is said to have given two speeches, arguing for\njustice one day and against justice the next. Whether or not this is\nhistorically correct (Powell 2013), the traditional take on\nCarneades\u2019 speeches is not that he aims to overthrow justice.\nInstead, the upshot is taken to be that he wants to show that the\nsupporters of justice\u2014including Plato and Aristotle\u2014do not\nhave the successful arguments they think they have to show what\njustice is and what it requires (Lactantius, Epitome 55.8, LS\n68M). Like Arcesilaus, Carneades (i) engages with Stoic epistemology.\nHis account of skeptical action includes (ii) a detailed proposal\nregarding the criterion. As part of his less radical skepticism,\nCarneades seems (iii) to allow for a certain kind of assent, and\nperhaps for belief.\n\n(i) The Stoic-Academic Debate. Chrysippus, the third major Stoic\n(after Zeno and Cleanthes), and his student Diogenes of Babylon,\nrevise Zeno\u2019s epistemology, defending it against\nArcesilaus\u2019 arguments (Brittain 2006, xiii). In response to\ntheir arguments, Carneades continues the exchange with the Stoics that\nArcesilaus began (SE M 7.402\u201310). His first move\naddresses the link between mental states and action. People in states\nof madness, he argues, act just as easily and naturally on their\nimpressions as other people, even those who act on cognitive\nimpressions (if there are any). From the point of view of exhibited\nbehavior, there does not seem to be a difference: any and all\nimpressions, even those the Stoics think clearly arise from something\nthat is not, are in all respects relevant to action completely on a\npar. Cognitive impressions, if there are any, have no superiority.\n\nIn a second argument, Carneades points to objects that are similar to\none another: can the wise person discern any two eggs, two grains of\nsand, and so on? The Stoics have multiple replies. It is conceivable\nthat, in some contexts of action, the wise person assents to what is\nreasonable (eulogon) (DL 1.177), without having a cognitive\nimpression of how things are. Or, if faced with the task to identify\ngrains of sand while lacking a cognitive impression, the wise person\ncan suspend judgment. However, the wise will train themselves so as to\nbe able to perceive minute differences (Cicero, Acad. 2.57),\nwhere it might be important to do so. This point is backed up by Stoic\nphysics: no two items in the universe are identical, and their\ndifferences are in principle perceptible (Sedley 1982, 2002).\nCarneades replies that even if no two things were exactly alike\n(consistent with his general line of argument, he does not take a\nstance on such questions), a very close similarity could appear to\nexist for all perceivers (Cicero, Acad. 2.83\u20135); that\nis, the impressions of two items, though in fact these items might\ndiffer from each other, could be indistinguishable (Nawar 2017, Shogry\n2018 and 2021). Discussion continues with a move on the part of the\nStoics: they add to their definition of the cognitive impression\n\u201cone that has no impediment.\u201d Sometimes an impression\nis\u2014as it were, by itself\u2014cognitive, but is unconvincing\ndue to external circumstances (SE M 7.253). It is a difficult\nquestion whether this addition harms the Stoics more than it helps\nthem. If the initial conception of a cognitive impression hangs on the\nidea that something about its phenomenological nature, or something\ninternal to the impression, marks it as cognitive, the Stoics give up\non a crucial assumption if they grant that sometimes there are\n\u201cimpediments.\u201d If, however, cognitive impressions are\ndifferentiated by a causal feature (the way they are caused by the\n\u2018imprinter\u2019 which causes the \u2018imprint\u2019), the\nfurther addition might help (Frede 1983, Nawar 2014), since the\nimpediment might need to be removed before the causal connection could\nbe confirmed (Hankinson 2003).\n\n(ii) Carneades\u2019 Criterion. Even though Carneades further pursues\na discussion begun by Arcesilaus, he does not simply continue within\nthe framework of Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism. The distinctiveness of\nhis position is best seen in the context of his criterion: the\npersuasive (pithanon). The notion of the persuasive can be\nunderstood in two distinctively different ways. Persuasiveness might\nbe a causal feature, so that a persuasive impression sets off a\nphysiological process of being moved in a certain way. But there may\nalso be a rational kind of persuasiveness. Carneades construes\npersuasiveness in rational terms. For him, the persuasive is the\nconvincing, or perhaps even the plausible.\n\nCarneades develops a three-stage criterion: (1) In matters of\nimportance, skeptics adhere to the persuasive. (2) In matters of\ngreater importance, they adhere to the persuasive and undiverted. A\npersuasive impression is undiverted if there is no tension between it\nand its surrounding impressions. (3) In matters that contribute to\nhappiness, skeptics adhere to persuasive, undiverted, and thoroughly\nexplored impressions. A persuasive impression is undiverted and\nthoroughly explored when it and the surrounding impressions are\nclosely examined without its persuasiveness being diminished (SE\nM 7.166\u201384). Consider an example. A skeptic looks in a\ndark room for a rope. Before they pick up what appears to them to be a\nrope, they look closely and poke it with a stick. Coiled objects can\nbe ropes, but they can also be snakes. The persuasive impression that\nthis is a rope must be examined before the skeptic adheres to it\n(M 7.187).\n\nThe three-stage criterion is put forward in the context of action.\nHowever, Sextus describes Carneades\u2019 criterion as a criterion of\ntruth, not a criterion of action (M 7.173). Carneades might\ntake himself to offer more than a practical criterion. His discussions\nof the persuasive come close to a general epistemological theory\n(Couissin 1929 [1983], Striker 1980, Bett 1989 and 1990, Allen 1994\nand 2004 [2006], Brittain 2001). Cicero renders the Greek\npithanon as probabile (and sometimes as veri\nsimile), which modern editors sometimes translate in terms of\nwhat is probable or likely to be true. Some scholars think that\nCarneades is an early thinker about likelihoods, and argue that he\ndevelops a fallibilist epistemology (Obdrzalek 2004).\n\n(iii) Assent and Belief. Does adherence to persuasive impressions\ninvolve belief? Carneades coins a term for the kind of adherence he\nhas been describing: approval (Cicero, Acad. 2.99). He\ndistinguishes it from assent in the sense of Stoic and other dogmatic\ntheories, which establishes a belief that something is in actual fact\ntrue; but he nevertheless describes it as a kind of assent (Cicero,\nAcad. 2.104). Carneades\u2019 disciples disagree on whether\napproval is any kind of genuine assent. That is, they disagree on\nwhether, in approval, one forms a belief. Philo and Metrodorus think\nthat Carneades allows for some kind of belief, close to or identical\nwith belief as the Stoics understand it. Clitomachus disagrees, and\nCicero follows Clitomachus (Acad. 2.78, see also 2.59, 2.67).\nScholars continue to debate these issues (Allen 2022), and the basic\nproblem remains unchanged. It is not clear whether there is a\nplausible notion of belief according to which belief falls short of\n\u2018holding to be true\u2019 (or according to which, though some\nkind of \u2018holding true\u2019 is involved, the relevant\naffirmation-as-true is weaker than in beliefs as Stoics and other\ndogmatist epistemologists conceive of them). In any event,\naffirmations as true, at least of the full and flat-out (\u201cin\nactual fact\u201d) sort the Stoics think of, are precisely what the\nskeptic does not make.\n\nAnother approach to Carneades\u2019 stance toward belief is to ask\nwhether he might invoke Platonic considerations. Consider that\nSocrates, when asked in the Republic what he thinks the good\nis, refuses to reply because he thinks beliefs without knowledge are\nshameful (Rp. 506c). In response to this, his interlocutors\npoint out that there is a difference between putting forward\none\u2019s beliefs as if one knew them to be true, and putting them\nforward with the proviso that they are merely beliefs (Vogt 2012a, ch.\n2). The shamefulness of mere belief might disappear through this\nproviso. A passage in Cicero\u2019s Academica suggests that\nCarneades invokes this thought. According to Carneades, the wise\nperson can hold beliefs if they fully understand them to be beliefs\n(2.148). Along similar lines, it has been suggested that Carneades\nmight conceive of a hypothetical mode of believing (Striker 1980\n[1996, 112]), perhaps engaging with a move in Plato\u2019s\nMeno. Investigation cannot get off the ground if we do not,\nin some sense, begin with our beliefs about the matter under\ninvestigation. But how can we do so without endorsing our beliefs, not\nknowing whether our views are true? Plato\u2019s answer at this point\nis: by hypothesizing our beliefs. Today we would insist that\nhypotheses are not beliefs. However, it is conceivable that Carneades\nargued along these lines, and that the details of his vocabulary got\nlost or confused in doxography.\n",
