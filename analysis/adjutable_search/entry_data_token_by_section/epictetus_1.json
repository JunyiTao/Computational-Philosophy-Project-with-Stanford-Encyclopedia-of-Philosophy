    "main_text": "Antecedents\n2. Antecedents\n\nThe essentials of Epictetus\u2019s thought derive from the early or\nfoundational period of Stoicism, from the third-century writings of\nZeno of Citium, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus. Treatises he mentions by\ntitle include Chrysippus\u2019 On Choice, On Impulse, and\nOn the Possibles, and he also mentions reading in works by\nZeno, Cleanthes, and the second-century Stoics Antipater and\nArchedemus. Extant reports and fragments of these and other Stoic\nworks offer many points of congruence with what we find in him.\n\nIt may still be the case that he accepts influence from other currents\nin philosophy, or that he develops some ideas on his own. The clearest\ninstance of such influence concerns Plato, for Epictetus draws much\ninspiration from the Socrates depicted in Plato\u2019s shorter\ndialogues. Comparisons can be drawn especially to the Socrates of\nPlato\u2019s Gorgias, with his fondness for argumentative\ngive and take, his willingness to challenge the hearer\u2019s\npresuppositions, and his optimism about what can be achieved through\nvalues clarification. The  Theaetetus may also have been\ninfluential on Epictetus\u2019s thinking about contemplation and the\nrelation of human to divine; see B\u00e9natou\u00efl 2013. Epictetus\nalso knows the Master Argument from Megarian philosophy\n(3rd c. BCE) and even names Diodorus and Panthoides,\nalthough this knowledge might easily have been drawn from Stoic\ntreatises on logic (2.19.1\u201311; see further Barnes 1997 ch. 3 and\nCrivelli in Scaltsas and Mason 2007).\n\nAn argument has sometimes been made for Aristotelian influence,\nprimarily because Epictetus\u2019s favored term prohairesis\n(see section 4.3 below) is prominent in Nicomachean Ethics\n3.1\u20135 as a quasi-technical term (there usually translated\n\u201cchoice\u201d or \u201cdecision\u201d). In particular, Dobbin\n(1991) has suggested that Epictetus\u2019s use of this term reflects\nthe influence of the early Aristotle commentaries (1st c.\nBCE-1st c. CE), none of which has survived for our\ninspection. But neither Aristotle nor any author in the Aristotelian\ntradition is ever mentioned in the Discourses. It is better\nto make the provisional assumption that his interest in volition\nderives, like other main elements of his philosophy, from the early\nStoa, though with greater emphasis. Although the term\nprohairesis is only barely attested in surviving accounts of\nearly Stoic philosophy, there is some evidence to suggest that it did\nplay a significant role; see Graver 2003.\n\nEpictetus never refers by name to the second century BCE Stoics\nPanaetius and Posidonius, and although he has something in common with\nPanaetius\u2019s reported interest in practical ethics and role-based\nresponsibilities, the evidence hardly suffices for an influence claim.\nReferences to other philosophers or schools are only in passing. He is\nimpressed with Cynicism, but sees it as a vocation to itinerant\nteaching and bare-bones living rather than as a body of doctrine\n(3.22). Epicureanism he identifies with the pleasure principle and\naccordingly despises (3.7).\n",
