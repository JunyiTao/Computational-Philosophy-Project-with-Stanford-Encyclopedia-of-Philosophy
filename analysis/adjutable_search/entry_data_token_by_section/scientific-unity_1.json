    "main_text": "Historical development in philosophy and science from Greek philosophy to Logical Empiricism in America || Rationalism and Enlightenment\n1.2 Rationalism and Enlightenment\n\nDescartes and Leibniz gave this tradition a rationalist twist that was\ncentered on the powers of human reason and the ideal of system of\nknowledge founded on rational principles. It became the project of a\nuniversal framework of exact categories and ideas, a mathesis\nuniversalis (Garber 1992; Gaukroger 2002). Adapting the\nscholastic image of knowledge, Descartes proposed an image of a tree\nin which metaphysics is depicted by the roots, physics by the trunk,\nand the branches depict mechanics, medicine and morals. Leibniz\nproposed a general science in the form of a demonstrative\nencyclopedia. This would be based on a \u201ccatalogue of simple\nthoughts\u201d and an algebraic language of symbols,\ncharacteristica universalis, which would render all knowledge\ndemonstrative and allow disputes to be resolved by precise\ncalculation. Both defended the program of founding much of physics on\nmetaphysics and ideas from life science (Smith 2011) (Leibniz\u2019s\nunifying ambitions with symbolic language and physics extended beyond\nscience, to settle religious and political fractures in Europe). By\ncontrast, while sharing a model of a geometric, axiomatic structure of\nknowledge, Newton\u2019s project of natural philosophy was meant to\nbe autonomous from a system of philosophy and, in the new context,\nstill endorsed, for its model of organization and its empirical\nreasoning, values of formal synthesis and ontological simplicity (see\nthe entry on\n Newton;\n also Janiak 2008).\n\nBelief in the unity of science or knowledge, along with the\nuniversality of rationality, was at its strongest during the European\nEnlightenment. The most important expression of the encyclopedic\ntradition came in the mid-eighteenth century from Diderot and\nD\u2019Alembert, editors of the Encyclop\u00e9die, ou\ndictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des\nm\u00e9tiers (1751\u20131772). Following earlier\nclassifications by Nichols and Bacon, their diagram presenting the\nclassification of intellectual disciplines was organized in terms of a\nclassification of human faculties. Diderot stressed in his own entry,\n\u201cEncyclopaedia\u201d, that the word signifies the unification\nof the sciences. The function of the encyclopedia was to exhibit the\nunity of human knowledge. Diderot and D\u2019Alembert, in contrast to\nLeibniz, made classification by subject the primary focus, and\nintroduced cross-references instead of logical connections. The\nEnlightenment tradition in Germany culminated in Kant\u2019s critical\nphilosophy.\n",
