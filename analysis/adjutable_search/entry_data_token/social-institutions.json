Typically, contemporary sociologists use the term to\nrefer to complex social forms that reproduce themselves such as\ngovernments, the family, human languages, universities, hospitals,\nbusiness corporations, and legal systems. A typical definition is that\nproffered by Jonathan Turner (1997: 6): \u201ca complex of\npositions, roles, norms and values lodged in particular types of\nsocial structures and organising relatively stable patterns of human\nactivity with respect to fundamental problems in producing\nlife-sustaining resources, in reproducing individuals, and in\nsustaining viable societal structures within a given\nenvironment.\u201d Again, Anthony Giddens (1984: 24) says:\n\u201cInstitutions by definition are the more enduring features of\nsocial life.\u201d He (Giddens 1984: 31) goes on to list as\ninstitutional orders, modes of discourse, political institutions,\neconomic institutions and legal institutions. The contemporary\nphilosopher of social science, Rom Harre follows the theoretical\nsociologists in offering this kind of definition (Harre 1979: 98):\n\u201cAn institution was defined as an interlocking double-structure\nof persons-as-role-holders or office-bearers and the like, and of\nsocial practices involving both expressive and practical aims and\noutcomes.\u201d He gives as examples (Harre 1979: 97) schools, shops,\npost offices, police forces, asylums and the British monarchy. In this\nentry the above-noted contemporary sociological usage will be\nfollowed. Doing so has the virtue of grounding philosophical theory in\nthe most salient empirical discipline, namely, sociology.\n\nIn the not so recent past it might have been asked why a theory of\nsocial institutions has, or ought to have, any philosophical interest;\nwhy not simply leave theories of institutions to the theoretical\nsociologists? However, in recent years philosophers have addressed a\nvariety of ontological, explanatory, normative and other theoretical\nissues concerning social institutions (Searle 1995, 2007 and 2010;\nTuomela 2002; Miller 2010; Epstein 2015; Guala 2016; Ludwig 2017). Of\nparticular importance is the work of John Searle (1995; 2010). One\nsource of the impetus for this has been recent philosophical work on\nsocial action and social forms more generally (Gilbert 1989; Searle\n1990); Tuomela 2007; Schmid 2009; Miller 2001; Bratman 2014; Tollefsen\n2015; Ludwig 2016). Another source is the recognition that a good deal\nof normative work on social justice, political philosophy and the like\npresupposes an understanding of social institutions. For instance,\nphilosophers, such as John Rawls (1972), have developed\nelaborate normative theories concerning the principles of justice that\nought to govern social institutions.  Yet they have done so in the\nabsence of a developed theory of the nature and point of the very\nentities (social institutions) to which the principles of justice in\nquestion are supposed to apply. Surely the adequacy of one\u2019s\nnormative account of the justice or otherwise of any given social\ninstitution, or system of social institutions, will depend at least in\npart on the nature and point of that social institution or\nsystem. Thus distributive justice is an important aspect of most, if\nnot all, social institutions; the role occupants of most institutions\nare the recipients and providers of benefits, e.g. wages, consumer\nproducts, and the bearers of burdens, e.g. allocated tasks and,\naccordingly, are subject to principles of distributive\njustice. Moreover, arguably some institutions, perhaps governments,\nhave as one of their defining ends or functions, to ensure conformity\nto principles of distributive justice in the wider society. However,\ndistributive justice does not appear to be a\ndefining feature, end or function of all social\ninstitutions. By this I do not mean that some social institutions are\nunjust and, for instance, exist in practice to serve narrow economic\nor other special interests (Marx 1867; Habermas 1978; Honneth 1995);\nthough clearly many are. Rather I am referring to the fact that a\nnumber of social institutions, such as the so-called Fourth Estate and\nthe university, are arguably not defined\u2014normatively\nspeaking\u2014in terms of justice, but rather by some other moral\nvalue(s), e.g. truth (Ostrom 2005; Miller 2010). \n\nThe entry has five sections. In the first section an overview of\nvarious salient accounts of social institutions and their main points\nof theoretical difference is provided. Accounts emanating from\nsociological theory as well as philosophy are mentioned. Here, as\nelsewhere, the boundaries between philosophy and non-philosophical\ntheorising in relation to an empirical science are vague. Hence, it is\nimportant to mention theories such as those of Emile Durkheim and\nTalcott Parsons, as well as those of John Searle and David Lewis.\nMoreover, it is also important to highlight some of the theoretical\ndifferences, notably those of an ontological character.\n\nIn the second section individualist theories of social institutions\nbased on rational choice theory and, in particular, on notions of\ncoordination equilibria are discussed (Lewis 1969; Guala 2016).\n\nIn the third section collective acceptance theories of social\ninstitutions are discussed (Searle 1995 and 2010; Tuomela 2002 and\n2007; Ludwig 2017). \n\nIn the fourth section the teleological account of social institutions\nis presented (Miller 2010).\n\nIn the fifth section, issues of agency are discussed. In what sense,\nif any, are institutions agents (French 1984; List and Pettit (2011);\nTollefsen 2015; Epstein 2015)? Is there an inconsistency between the\nautonomy (or alleged autonomy) of individual human agents, on the one\nhand, and the ubiquity and pervasive influence of institutions on\nindividual character and behaviour, on the other (Giddens 1984;\nBhaskar 1979)?\n", "toc": [{"#AccSocIns": "1.

Social Institutions: An Overview\n\nAny account of social institutions must begin by informally marking\noff social institutions from other social forms. Unfortunately, as\nnoted above, in ordinary language the terms \u201cinstitutions\u201d\nand \u201csocial institutions\u201d are used to refer to a\nmiscellany of social forms, including conventions, rules, rituals,\norganisations, and systems of organisations. Moreover, there are a\nvariety of theoretical accounts of institutions, including\nsociological as well as philosophical ones. Indeed, many of these\naccounts of what are referred to as institutions are not accounts of\nthe same phenomena; they are at best accounts of overlapping fields of\nsocial phenomena. Nevertheless, it is possible, firstly, to mark off a\nrange of related social forms that would be regarded by most theorists\nas being properly describable as social institutions; and, secondly,\nto compare and contrast some of the competing theoretical accounts of\nthe \u201csocial institutions\u201d in question.\n\nSocial institutions in the sense in use in this entry need to be\ndistinguished from less complex social forms such as conventions,\nrules, social norms, roles and rituals. The latter are among the\nconstitutive elements of institutions.\n\nSocial institutions also need to be distinguished from more complex\nand more complete social entities, such as societies or cultures, of\nwhich any given institution is typically a constitutive element. A\nsociety, for example, is more complete than an institution since a\nsociety\u2014at least as traditionally understood\u2014is more or\nless self-sufficient in terms of human resources, whereas an\ninstitution is not. Thus, arguably, for an entity to be a society it\nmust sexually reproduce its membership, have its own language and\neducational system, provide for itself economically and\u2014at least\nin principle\u2014be politically independent.\n\nSocial institutions are often organisations (Scott 2001). Moreover,\nmany institutions are systems of organisations grounded in\neconomic, political etc. spheres of activity (Walzer 1983). For\nexample, capitalism is a particular kind of economic institution, and\nin modern times capitalism consists in large part in specific\norganisational forms\u2014including multi-national\ncorporations\u2014organised into a system. Further, some institutions\nare meta-institutions; they are institutions (organisations)\nthat organise other institutions (including systems of organisations).\nFor example, governments are meta-institutions. The institutional end\nor function of a government consists in large part in organising other\ninstitutions (both individually and collectively); thus governments\nregulate and coordinate economic systems, educational institutions,\npolice and military organisations and so on largely by way of\n(enforceable) legislation.\n\nIn this entry the concern is principally with social institutions\n(including meta-institutions) that are also organisations or systems\nof organisations. However, it should be noted that institutions of\nlanguage, such as the English language, are often regarded not simply\nas institutions but as more fundamental than many other kinds of\ninstitution by virtue of being presupposed by, or in part constitutive\nof, other institutions. Searle, for example, holds to the latter view\n(Searle 1995: 37; Searle 2008). A case might also be made that the\nfamily is a more fundamental institution than others for related\nreasons, e.g. it is the site of sexual reproduction and initial\nsocialisation (Schoeman 1980; Lamanna 2002). \n\nNote also that uses of the term \u201cinstitution\u201d in such\nexpressions as \u201cthe institution of government\u201d, are often\nambiguous. Sometimes what is meant is a particular token, e.g. the\ncurrent government in Australia, sometimes a type, i.e. the set of\nproperties instantiated in any actual government, and sometimes a set\nof tokens, i.e. all governments. Restricting the notion of an\ninstitution to organisations is helpful in this regard; the term\n\u201corganisation\u201d almost always refers to a particular token.\nOn the other hand, the term \u201cinstitution\u201d connotes a\ncertain gravity not connoted by the term \u201corganisation\u201d;\nso arguably those institutions that are organisations are\norganisations that have a central and important role to play in or for\na society. Being central and important to a society, such roles are\nusually long lasting ones; hence institutions are typically\ntrans-generational.\n\nHaving informally marked off social institutions from other social\nforms, let us turn to a consideration of some general properties of\nsocial institutions. Here there are four salient properties, namely,\nstructure, function, culture and sanctions.\n\nRoughly speaking, an institution that is an organisation or system of\norganisations consists (at least) of an embodied (occupied by human\npersons) structure of differentiated roles (Miller 2010; Ludwig 2017).\n(Naturally, many institutions also have have additional non-human\ncomponents, e.g. buildings, raw materials.) These roles are defined in\nterms of tasks, and rules regulating the performance of those tasks.\nMoreover, there is a degree of interdependence among these roles, such\nthat the performance of the constitutive tasks of one role cannot be\nundertaken, or cannot be undertaken except with great difficulty,\nunless the tasks constitutive of some other role or roles in the\nstructure have been undertaken or are being undertaken. Further, these\nroles are often related to one another hierarchically, and hence\ninvolve different levels of status and degrees of authority. Finally,\non teleological and functional accounts, these roles are related to\none another in part in virtue of their contribution to (respectively)\nthe end(s) or function(s) of the institution; and\nthe realisation of these ends or function normally involves\ninteraction among the institutional actors in question and external\nnon-institutional actors. (The assumption here is that the concept of\nan end and of a function are distinct concepts. On some accounts,\nfunction is a quasi-causal notion (Cohen 1978 Chapter IX), on others\nit is a teleological notion, albeit one that does not necessarily\ninvolve the existence of any mental states (Ryan 1970 Chapter 8)). The\nconstitutive roles of an institution and their relations to one\nanother can be referred to as the structure of the\ninstitution. \n\nI note that the common-sense view that an institution consists\n(essentially) of an embodied structure of roles has been thought by\nsome to be undermined by the consideration that actions are ascribed\nto institutions per se (as opposed to their members), e.g. in the\nsentence, \u2018The Supreme Court of the United State ruled that\nsegregation is unconstitutional\u2019, and the fact that an\ninstitution could have had different members than the ones it actually\nhad, e.g. someone other than Brett Kavanaugh might have been nominated\nby President Trump to sit on the Supreme Court and confirmed by the US\nSenate. In response to this kind of argument Ludwig has, in effect,\ndefended the common-sense view by proffering his time-indexed,\nreductive individualist view according to which not only is the\nSupreme Court the group that consists of everyone who is at any time a\nmember of the Supreme Court, but what the Supreme Court does at any\ntime is what the those justices at that time do (Ludwig 2017: 66).\nImportantly, Ludwig points out that the term, \u201cthe Supreme Court\nof the US\u201d functions as a definite description and not a name.\nAs is the case with all definite descriptions, e.g. \u201cthe\nPresident of the US\u201d, the individuals picked out by \u201cthe\nSupreme Court of the US\u201d could have been different (Ludwig 2017:\n68). \n\nAn important distinction relevant to the understanding of\ninstitutional structure can be made between what is constitutive of an\ninstitution, e.g. the judges of the Supreme Court, and what is\nrequired to maintain it in existence, e.g. acceptance of the authority\nof the Supreme Court by the US citizenry. (See sections 3 and 5\nbelow.)\n\nNote that on the conception of institutions as embodied\nstructures of roles and associated rules, the nature of any\ninstitution at a given time will to some extent reflect the personal\ncharacter of different role occupants, especially influential role\noccupants, e.g. the British Government during the Second World War\nreflected to some extent Winston Churchill\u2019s character.\nMoreover, institutions in this sense are dynamic, evolving entities;\nas such, they have a history, the diachronic structure of a narrative\nand (usually) a partially open-ended future.\n\nAside from the formal and usually explicitly stated, or defined, tasks\nand rules, there is an important implicit and informal dimension of an\ninstitution roughly describable as institutional culture.\nThis notion comprises the informal attitudes, values, norms, and the\nethos or \u201cspirit\u201d which pervades an institution. As such,\nit is to be distinguished from the wider notions of culture frequently\nin use among anthropologists. Culture in the wide sense embraces not\nonly informal but also formal elements of institutions, e.g. rules and\nother components of structure (Tylor 1871; Munch and Smelser 1993)).\nCulture in the narrow sense influences much of the activity of the\nmembers of that institution, or at least the manner in which that\nactivity is undertaken. So while the explicitly determined rules and\ntasks might say nothing about being secretive or \u201csticking by\none\u2019s mates come what may\u201d or having a hostile or negative\nattitude to particular social groups, these attitudes and practices\nmight in fact be pervasive; they might be part of the culture\n(Skolnick 2008). \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that in addition to structure, function and\nculture, social institutions necessarily involve sanctions. It is\nuncontroversial that social institutions involve informal sanctions,\nsuch as moral disapproval following on non-conformity to institutional\nnorms. However, some theorists, e.g. Jon Elster (1989: Chapter XV),\nargue that formal sanctions, such as punishment, are a necessary\nfeature of institutions. Formal sanctions are certainly a feature of\nmost, if not all, of those institutions that operate within a legal\nsystem. However, they do not appear to be a feature of all\ninstitutions. Consider, for example, an elaborate and longstanding\nsystem of informal economic exchange among members of different\nsocieties that have no common system of laws or enforced rules.\n\nThus far we have informally marked off social institutions from other\nsocial forms, and we have identified a number of general properties of\nsocial institutions. It is now time to introduce and taxonomize some\nof the main theoretical accounts of social institutions, including\nhistorically important ones. In sections 2, 3 and 4 recent influential\ntheories of social institutions will be discussed in more detail.\n\nNotwithstanding our understanding of social institutions as complex\nsocial forms, some theoretical accounts of institutions identify\ninstitutions with relatively simple social forms\u2014especially\nconventions, social norms or rules. At one level this is merely a\nverbal dispute; contra our procedure here, such simpler forms could\nsimply be termed \u201cinstitutions\u201d. However, at another level\nthe dispute is not merely verbal, since what we are calling\n\u201cinstitutions\u201d would on such a view consist simply of sets\nof conventions, social norms or rules. Let us refer to such accounts\nas atomistic theories of institutions (Taylor 1985: Chapter\n7). Schotter is a case in point (Schotter 1981) as is North\n(1990). The best known contemporary form of atomism is rational choice\ntheory and it has been widely accepted in, indeed it is in part\nconstitutive of, modern economics. The most influential philosophical\ntheory within a broadly rational choice framework is David\nLewis\u2019 theory of conventions (Lewis 1969). According to Lewis,\nconventions are regularities in action that solve coordination\nproblems confronted by individual agents.\n\nThe \u201catoms\u201d within atomistic accounts themselves typically\nconsist of the actions of individual human persons, e.g. conventions\nas regularities in action. The individual agents are not themselves\ndefined in terms of institutional forms, such as institutional roles.\nHence atomistic theories of institutions tend to go hand in glove with\natomistic theories of all collective entities, e.g. a society consists\nof an aggregate of individual human persons. Moreover, atomistic\ntheories tend to identify the individual agent as the locus of moral\nvalue. On this kind of view, social forms, including social\ninstitutions, have moral value only derivatively, i.e. only in so far\nas they contribute to the prior needs, desires or other requirements\nof individual agents.\n\nThe regularities in action (or rules or norms) made use of in such\natomistic accounts of institutions cannot simply be a single\nperson\u2019s regularities in action (or a single person\u2019s\nrules or norms prescribing his or her individual action alone); rather\nthere must be interdependence of action such that, for example, agent\nA only performs action x, if other agents,\nB and C do likewise. Moreover, some account of the\ninterdependence of action in question is called for, e.g. that it is\nnot the sort of interdependence of action involved in conflict\nsituations (although it might arise as a solution to a prior conflict\nsituation).\n\nAssume that the conventions, norms or rules in question are social in\nthe sense that they involve the required interdependence of action,\ne.g. the parties to any given convention, or the adherent to any such\nnorm or rule, conform to (respectively) the convention, norm or rule\non the condition that others do. Nevertheless, such interdependence of\naction is not sufficient for a convention, norm or rule, or even a set\nof conventions, norms or rules, to be an institution. Governments,\nuniversities, corporations etc. are structured, unitary entities.\nAccordingly, a mere set of conventions (or norms or rules)\ndoes not constitute an institution. For example, the set of\nconventions comprising the convention to drive on the left, the\nconvention to utter, \u201cAustralia\u201d, to refer to Australia,\nand the convention to use chopsticks does not constitute an\ninstitution. Accordingly, a problem for atomistic accounts of social\ninstitutions is the need to provide an account of the structure and\nunity of social institutions, and an account that is faithful to\natomism, e.g. that the structure is essentially aggregative in nature.\nOn the other hand, \u2018atomists\u2019 can obviously help\nthemselves to some notion of a bundle of related conventions or rules.\nConsider for instance a set of traffic rules, e.g. \u2018drive on the\nleft\u2019, \u2018do not exceed 35 miles per hour in built up\nareas\u2019 and so on. Moreover, the \u2018bundle\u2019 might\ninclude a variety of types of atomistic social forms, e.g.\nconventions, norms and rules. Guala\u2019s account of institutions\n(Guala 2016) is a case in point, as we shall see in section 2 below.\n\n\nBy contrast with atomistic accounts of social institutions,\nholistic\u2014including\nstructuralist-functionalist\u2014accounts stress the\ninter-relationships of institutions (structure) and their contribution\nto larger and more complete social complexes, especially societies\n(function). Thus according to Barry Barnes (1995: 37):\n\u201cFunctionalist theories in the social sciences seek to describe,\nto understand and in most cases to explain the orderliness and\nstability of entire social systems. In so far as they treat\nindividuals, the treatment comes after and emerges from analysis of\nthe system as a whole. Functionalist theories move from an\nunderstanding of the whole to an understanding of the parts of that\nwhole, whereas individualism proceeds in the opposite\ndirection\u201d. Moreover, (Barnes 1995: 41), \u201csuch accounts\nlist the \u201dfunctions\u201c of the various institutions. They\ndescribe the function of the economy as the production of goods and\nservices essential to the operation of the other institutions and\nhence the system as a whole.\u201d Such theorists include Durkheim\n(1964), Radcliffe-Brown (1958) and Parsons (1968; 1982). Of particular\nconcern to these theorists was the moral decay consequent (in their\nview) upon the demise of strong, mutually supportive social\ninstitutions. Durkheim, for example, advocated powerful professional\nassociations. He said (1957 p.6): \n\nA system of morals is always the affair of a group and can operate\nonly if the group protects them by its authority. It is made up of\nrules which govern individuals, which compel them to act in such and\nsuch a way, and which impose limits to their inclinations and forbid\nthem to go beyond. Now there is only one moral power\u2014moral, and\nhence common to all\u2014which stands above the individual and which\ncan legitimately make laws for him, and that is collective power. To\nthe extent the individual is left to his own devices and freed from\nall social constraint, he is unfettered by all moral constraint. It is\nnot possible for professional ethics to escape this fundamental\ncondition of any system of morals. Since, then, the society as a whole\nfeels no concern in professional ethics, it is imperative that there\nbe special groups in the society, within which these morals may be\nevolved, and whose business it is to see that they are observed.\n\n\nMoreover, here the meta-institution of government obviously has a\npivotal directive and integrative role in relation to other\ninstitutions and their inter-relationships, even though government is\nitself simply one institution within the larger society. Further,\nholistic accounts of institutions lay great stress on institutional\nroles defined in large part by social norms; institutional roles are\nsupposedly largely, or even wholly, constitutive of the identity of\nthe individual human agents who occupy these roles. (Individuals\nparticipate in a number of institutions and hence occupy a number of\ninstitutional roles; hence the alleged possibility of their identity\nbeing constituted by a number of different institutional roles.)\n\nMany such holistic accounts deploy and depend on the model, or at\nleast analogy, of an organism. A salient historical figure here is\nHerbert Spencer (1971, Part 3B\u2014A Society is an\nOrganism). On this holistic, organicist model, social\ninstitutions are analogous to the organs or limbs of a human body.\nEach organ or limb has a function the realisation of which contributes\nto the well-being of the body as a whole, and none can exist\nindependently of the others. Thus the human body relies on the stomach\nto digest food in order to continue living, but the stomach cannot\nexist independently of the body or of other organs, such as the heart.\nLikewise, it is suggested, any given institution, e.g. law courts,\ncontributes to the well-being of the society as a whole, and yet is\ndependent on other institutions, e.g. government. Here the\n\u201cwell-being\u201d of the society as a whole is sometimes\nidentified with the stability and continuation of the society as it\nis; hence the familiar charge that holistic, organicist accounts are\ninherently politically conservative. This political conservatism\ntransmutes into political authoritarianism when society is identified\nwith the system of institutions that constitute the nation-state and\nthe meta-institution of the nation-state\u2014the government\u2014is\nassigned absolute authority in relation to all other institutions.\nHence the contrasting emphasis in political liberalism on the\nseparation of powers among, for example, the executive, the\nlegislature and the judiciary. \n\nHolistic accounts of social institutions often invoke the terminology\nof internal and external relations (Bradley 1935). An internal\nrelation is one that is definitive of, or in some way essential to,\nthe entity it is a relation of; by contrast, external relations are\nnot in this way essential. Thus being married to someone is an\ninternal relation of spouses; if a man is a husband then necessarily\nhe stands in the relation of being married to someone else. Likewise,\nif someone is a judge in a court of law then necessarily he stands in\nan adjudicative relationship to defendants. Evidently, many\ninstitutional roles are possessed of, and therefore in part defined\nby, their internal relations to other institutional roles.\n\nHowever, the existence of institutional roles with internal relations\nto other institutional roles does not entail a holistic account of\nsocial institutions. For the internal relations in question might not\nbe relations among institutional roles in different institutions;\nrather they might simply be internal relations among different\ninstitutional roles in the same institution. On the other hand, the\nexistence of institutional roles with internal relations does\nundermine the attempts of certain forms of atomistic individualism to\nreduce institutions to the individual human agents who happen to\nconstitute them; ex hypothesi, the latter are not qua individual human\npersons in part defined in terms of their relations to institutional\nroles.\n\nIn the context of a discussion of atomistic and holist accounts of\ninstitutions, it is important to distinguish the view that\ninstitutions are not reducible to the individual human persons who\nconstitute them from the view that institutions are themselves agents\npossessed of minds and a capacity to reason (see Section 5). Epstein\n(2015) has offered detailed arguments against the former view,\nincluding in its favoured contemporary form according to which\ninstitutions (and other collective entities) supervene on the\nindividual persons whose roles they occupy. Thus Epstein points out\n(2015: 46) that some facts about the firm, Starbucks, do not depend\n(supervene)on facts about people and the actions they perform but\nrather on facts about coffee, for instance. (See also Ruben\n1985). Peter French (1984) is an advocate of the latter view as are,\nin somewhat different forms, List and Pettit (2011), Tollefsen (2015)\nand Epstein (2015). (See also Margaret Gilbert\u2019s notion of a\n\u201cplural subject\u201d [1989: 200]). Searle (1990), Miller\n(2001) and Ludwig (2017) have argued against the\nproposition that collective entities per se are agents possessed of\nmental states. For instance, Ludwig has offered analyses of sentences\nthat apparently ascribe mental states to collective entities, such as\n\u2018Germany intends to invade Poland\u2019, in terms of the\nintentions of individual members of these entities, and the actions of\ncollective entities in terms of the members of the collective group in\nquestion being agents of an event (Ludwig 2017).\n\nThus far we have discussed atomistic and holistic accounts of social\ninstitutions. However, there is a third possibility, namely, (what\nmight be termed) molecular accounts. Roughly speaking, a\nmolecular account of an institution would not seek to reduce the\ninstitution to simpler atomic forms, such as conventions; nor would it\nseek to define an institution in terms of its relationships with other\ninstitutions and its contribution to the larger societal whole.\nRather, each institution would be analogous to a molecule; it would\nhave constitutive elements (\u201catoms\u201d) but also have its own\nstructure and unity. A number of philosophical theories of social\ninstitutions are explicitly or implicitly molecular in character\n(Harre 1969; Searle 1995; Miller 2010). Moreover, on this conception\neach social institution would have a degree of independence\nvis-\u00e0-vis other institutions and the society at large; on the\nother hand, the set of institutions might itself under certain\nconditions form a unitary system of sorts, e.g. a contemporary liberal\ndemocratic nation-state comprised of a number of semi-autonomous\npublic and private institutions functioning in the context of the\nmeta-institution of government.\n\nA general problem for holistic organicist accounts of social\ninstitutions\u2014as opposed to molecular accounts\u2014is that\nsocial institutions can be responses to trans-societal\nrequirements or needs. Accordingly, an institution is not necessarily\na constitutive element of some given society in the sense that it is\nboth in part constitutive of that society and wholly contained within\nthat society. Examples of such trans-societal institutions are the\ninternational financial system, the international legal system, the\nUnited Nations and some multi-national corporations. Indeed, arguably\nany given element of such a trans-societal institution stands in some\ninternal relations to elements of other societies.\n\nIn this section accounts of institutions have been discussed in\ngeneral terms. It is now time to focus on some specific influential,\ncontemporary philosophical accounts beginning with ones based in\nrational choice theory.\n2. Social Institutions and Coordination Equilibria\n\nAs noted above, the starting point for theories of social institutions\nutilising a rational choice framework is Lewis\u2019 theory of\nconventions (Lewis 1969). According to Lewis\u2014who was inspired by\nHume (Hume 1740: Book III)\u2014conventions are the solutions to\ncoordination problems. (See also Schwayder 1965.) Thus the regularity\nin behaviour of driving on the right is the solution to the\ncoordination problem confronting road users. Here there are two\nequilibria: everyone driving on the right or, alternatively, everyone\ndriving on the left. Everyone driving on the right is an equilibrium\nsince everyone prefers to drive on the right, given everyone else\ndoes, and everyone expects everyone to drive on the right. Conventions\nare certainly ubiquitous. However, social institutions evidently\nconsist in more than conventions. Importantly, as noted above, they\nconsist in part in rules, including but not restricted to laws and\nregulations. But regularities in behaviour that result from compliance\nwith rules are not necessarily equilibria in the sense in use in\nrational choice theory. Accordingly, a serviceable account of social\ninstitutions looks like it needs to help itself (at least) to both\nconventions (or, at least, equilibria in the sense of Nash equilibria,\ni.e. (roughly) a combination of actions such that no actor has an\nincentive to change his or her action unilaterally), and rules. \n\nGuala has propounded an account of institutions he refers to as the\nrules-in-equilibrium approach. This account, as its name suggests,\nseeks to unify the rules-based conception of institutions and the view\nthat institutions are the equilibria of strategic games (Guala 2016).\nAs such, institutions facilitate coordination and cooperation; indeed,\nthat is their defining function. However, regularities in behaviour in\naccordance with an equilibrium strategy, e.g. everyone driving on the\nleft, typically take the form of a rule, e.g. \u2018Drive on the\nleft\u2019. Therefore, according to Guala, essentially institutions\nare rules that people are motivated to follow, i.e. rules backed up by\na system of incentives and expectations that motivate people to follow\nthese rules. Accordingly, and in contrast with collective acceptance\naccounts (see section 3 below), there is no need to posit joint\nintentions or the like in order to ensure the rules in part\nconstitutive of an institution are followed\u2014or otherwise to\nprovide the \u2018glue\u2019 that holds an institution together.\n\n\nMoreover, contra Searle (1995) and (again) contra the\ncollective acceptance account (see section 3 below), for the most part\ninstitutional rules are merely regulative and not constitutive (Guala\n2016: ch.5). Roughly speaking, a regulative rule governs a\npre-existing action type, e.g. \u2018Do not walk on the grass\u2019,\nwhereas constitutive rules (supposedly) create new forms of activity,\ne.g. the rules of chess, and have the form \u2018X counts as Y in\ncircumstances, C\u2019 (Searle 2010: 96). According to Guala,\nconstitutive rules are not necessary to institutions; regulative rules\nare sufficient. (See section 3 below.) \n\nGuala\u2019s account has implications for controversies concerning\nalleged differences between the natural sciences and the social\nsciences and, specifically, for the pluralist view that unlike natural\nentities, social entities, such as institutions, are mind-dependent\n(Searle 2010). For example, the fact that a dollar bill is money and\nnot merely paper, depends on a collective belief that it can be used\nas a medium of exchange. By contrast, a molecule of water is water\nirrespective of anyone\u2019s belief. At this point Guala invokes a\ndistinction between causal dependence and ontological dependence.\nDollar bills are causally dependent on beliefs but not ontologically\ndependent. Since the causal dependence of social entities on beliefs\nand the like is consistent with the causal dependence of natural\nentities on one another and on beliefs etc., the mind-dependence of\nsocial entities does not imply a pluralist view of the natural\nsciences and the social sciences. A monist conception is admissible.\n\n\nMoreover, according to Guala, the view that institutions are\nmind-dependent (Searle 2010: 17\u201318) is inconsistent with the existence\nof mistaken beliefs about institutions on the part of participants in\nthose institutions. Guala is certainly right to claim that there are\nsuch mistaken beliefs, e.g. everyone might falsely believe that their\nworthless devalued currency was money. What of his argument that some\nadvocates of the mind-dependence of institutions are necessarily\ncommitted to infallibilism\u2014and, specifically, to the false claim\nthat institutional participants cannot be mistaken about their\ninstitutions? Guala states that infallibilism about social kinds (e.g.\nwe cannot be wrong about whether a piece of paper is money or not) and\nanti-realism (e.g. a piece of paper is money if we collectively accept\nthat it is) go together and do so \u201cbecause their\nopposites\u2014realism and fallibilism are tightly connected\u201d\n(Guala 2016:151). If objects exist independently of our\nrepresentations of them (realism) then our representations can be\nmistaken (fallibilism). On the other hand, if objects ontologically\ndepend on our representations of them (anti-realism)\u2014and, in\nparticular, our collective beliefs about them\u2014then we cannot be\nmistaken about them (infallibilism). \n\nGuala also argues (2016: ch. 14) that his monist\nrules-in-equilibrium approach can resolve normative disputes, such as\nthose in relation to same-sex marriage. On his unified account, he\nclaims, realism can be preserved, e.g. marriage does not depend\nnon-causally on our intentions, but yet same-sex marriage is\nallowable. In this connection Guala relies on the type/token\ndistinction and argues that while institution tokens solve particular\ncoordination problems, institution types are identified by their\nfunctions, e.g. same-sex unions fulfil the functions of marriage.\nHowever, the conservative view, e.g. of the Catholic Church, would\nsimply dispute that same-sex marriages do serve the same essential\nfunctions, e.g., the function of procreation. Moreover, this manoeuvre\ndoes not seem to address adequately the normative questions that now\narises at the level of functions. What function or functions ought\nmarriage serve? What moral constraints are there on specific social\narrangements that might otherwise serve those functions, e.g.\npolygamy? Here it is a background assumption that while the function\nor functions that an institution should have depends in part on the\nfunctions that it in fact has, one cannot simply read off the former\nfrom the latter. A corrupt police force might have the enrichment of\nmost of its officers as one of its de facto functions but it would not\nfollow from this that this was a legitimate function.\n\nMoreover, Guala\u2019s normative neutrality is open to question.\nGuala\u2019s rules-in-equilibrium account of institutions helps\nitself only to instrumental normativity (including the rationality of\ncompliance due to sanctions) and eschews moral considerations in\nfavour of the permissive notion of preference. The contrast here is\nwith the teleological account (section 4) which grounds institutions\non collective goods, especially aggregate human need, e.g. the need\nfor food (agricultural institutions), health (hospitals), education\n(schools), security (police services) etc. And, as David Wiggins has\nargued (1991) needs generate moral obligations. On\nGuala\u2019s view cooperative enterprises which undermine\ninstitutions, e.g. corrupt cliques, criminal organisations, can\nthemselves be institutions, as can somewhat trivial\nconvention-governed games, e.g. tic-tac-toe, hopscotch. \n\nMore generally, Guala\u2019s view seems to overstate the coordinating\nfunction of institutions and, as a result, conflate the underlying\nproblem solved by an institution with the surface problem that the\navailability of multiple solutions gives rise to, i.e. the problem of\ncoordinating on one of the available solutions. Thus the underlying\nproblem of avoiding traffic collisions is solved by all traffic\ntravelling in one direction keeping to one side of the road and all\ntraffic travelling in the opposite direction keeping to the opposite\nside. However, this solution now gives rise to a coordination problem\nsince there are two equally good solutions, i.e. all driving on the\nleft or all driving on the right. This point applies to other rational\nchoice coordination equilibria approaches, including Lewis\u2019\ninfluential theory of conventions (Miller 1986).\n3. Collective Acceptance Theory of Institutions\n\nCollective acceptance accounts and, for that matter teleological\naccounts, of social action in general, and of social institutions in\nparticular, fall within the rationalist, individualist, philosophy of\naction tradition that has its roots in Aristotle, Hume and Kant and is\nassociated with contemporary analytic philosophers of social action\nsuch as Michael Bratman (1987), John Searle (1995), and Raimo Tuomela\n(2002). However, this way of proceeding also has a place outside\nphilosophy, in sociological theory. Broadly speaking, it is the\nstarting point for the voluntaristic theory of social action\nassociated with the likes of Georg Simmel (1971), Max Weber (1949),\n(the early) Talcott Parsons (1968) and Alfred Schutz (Schutz\nand Parsons 1978). For example, the following idea in relation to\nsocial action is expressed by Parsons (1968: 229): \n\nactions do not take place separately each with a separate, discrete\nend in relation to the situation, but in long complicated\n\u2018chains\u2019 \u2026 [and] the total complex of means-end\nrelationships is not to be thought of as similar to a large number of\nparallel threads, but as a complicated web (if not a tangle).\n\n\nHowever, unsurprisingly, the teleological account lays much greater\nexplanatory emphasis on the means-end relationship in collective\naction contexts and much less on collective acceptance. \n\nThat said, the starting point for both kinds of theory has been the\nnotion of a joint action and its constitutive conative notions (or,at\nleast, terminology) of shared intentions (Bratman 2014), we-intentions\n(Tuomela 2013), collective intentions (Searle 1990), collective ends\n(Miller 2001: Chapter 2), depending on which theorist is in question.\nExamples of joint action are two people lifting a table together, and\ntwo men jointly pushing a car. However, such basic two person joint\nactions exist at one end of a spectrum. At the other end are much more\ncomplex, multi-person, joint actions, such as a large group of\nengineers, tradesmen and construction workers jointly building a\nskyscraper or the members of an army jointly fighting a battle.\n\nOver the last several decades a number of analyses of joint action\nhave emerged (Gilbert 1989; Miller 2001: Chapter 2; Searle 1990 and\n1995; Tuomela 2002; Schmid 2009; Ludwig 2016). A number of these\ntheorists have developed and applied their favoured basic accounts of\njoint action in order to account for a range of social phenomena,\nincluding conventions, social norms and social institutions.\n\nIndividualism (of which more below) is committed to an analysis of\njoint action such that ultimately a joint action consists of: (1) a\nnumber of singular actions; and (2) relations among these singular\nactions. Moreover, the constitutive conative attitudes involved in\njoint actions are individual attitudes; there are no sui generis\nwe-attitudes.\n\nBy contrast, according to supra-individualists (Gilbert 1989), when a\nplurality of individual agents perform a joint action, then the agents\nhave the relevant propositional attitudes (beliefs, intentions etc.)\nin an irreducible \u2018we-form\u2019, which is sui generis (Searle\n1990) and as such not analysable in terms of individual or I-attitudes\nTuomela 2013). Moreover, the individual agents constitute a new\nentity, a supra-individual entity not reducible to the individual\nagents and the relations among them (Epstein 2015).\n\nIf the starting point for theorists in this strand of contemporary\nphilosophy of action is joint action (and its associated collective\nintentionality), it is by no means the endpoint. Specifically, there\nis the important matter of the relationship between joint action and\nsocial institutions. For example, while joint actions per se do not\nseem to necessarily involve rights, duties and other deontic\nproperties (see Gilbert 1989 for a contrary view), it is self-evident\nthat social institutions do so. Theorists within this recent tradition\nagree that joint actions\u2014or perhaps the collective\nintentionality definitive of joint actions\u2014is at least one of\nthe building blocks of social institutions. However, the question\nremains as to the precise relationship between joint actions (and its\nassociated collective intentionality) on the one hand, and social\ninstitutions on the other. More specifically, there is the question of\nhow, or if, we-intentions can generate deontic properties, such as the\ninstitutional rights and duties definitive of institutional roles.\n\n\nAccording to collective acceptance accounts (Searle 1995 and 2010;\nTuomela 2002; Ludwig 2017), social institutions are created and\nmaintained by collective acceptance. Collective acceptance accounts\nare constructivist; institutional facts and, therefore, institutions\nexist only in so far as they are collectively believed to exist or are\notherwise the content of a collective attitude, such as a\nwe-intention. Typically, such collective attitudes are not to be\nunderstood as reducible to individual attitudes or aggregates thereof.\n(Ludwig is an exception among collective acceptance adherents.\nAccording to him the so-called we-intentions constitutive of\ncollective acceptance (Ludwig 2017: 132) are analysable in terms of\ninterlocking individual intentions to achieve some outcome by means of\na shared plan (Ludwig 2017: 26)). Thus Searle claims his notion of a\ncollective intention or we-intention is a primitive notion that is not\nreducible to an individual intention, nor to an individual intention\nin conjunction with other individual attitudes such as individual\nbeliefs (Searle 1995: 24\u20136; Searle 2010: Chapter 3). Searle\u2019s\ninvocation of an unanalysed allegedly primitive notion is\ncontroversial in the context of reductive accounts (Miller 2001;\nBratman 2014; Ludwig 2016). On the other hand, Tuomela provides a\nnon-reductive analysis of we-intentions. He makes a distinction\nbetween irreducibly collective we-mode attitudes and individualistic\npro-group I-mode attitudes (Tuomela 2013: 6\u20137) and does so on the\ngrounds that the former involve the intention to act together as a\ngroup. However, Tuomela is open to the objection that the notion of\nacting qua member of a group can itself be analysed as acting in\naccording with an individual end which each agent has interdependently\nwith the others (a shared interdependent end) (Miller 2010: 52\u201354).\n\n\nCollective acceptance is not simply a matter of psychological\nattitudes standing in some straightforward causal relation to the\nexternal world as is the case, for instance, with common or\ngarden-variety intentions, including the joint intentions definitive\nof basic joint actions. The idea is not that a group forms a joint\nintention to (say) push a boulder up a hill and, thereby, jointly\ncause the boulder to be relocated to the top of the hill. Rather the\nnotion of a performative is typically invoked (Austin 1962; Searle\n2010: 11).\n\nExamples of performatives are: \u2018I name this ship the Queen\nElizabeth\u2019\u2014as uttered when smashing the bottle against the\nstem; \u2018I give and bequeath my watch to my\nbrother\u2019\u2014as occurring in a will (Austin 1962: 5).\nPerformative are speech acts which bring about an outcome in the\nexternal world (e.g. that the name of the ship is the Queen Elizabeth\nor that my brother is the owner of what used to be my watch).\nSpecifically, performatives are sayings which are also doings. In\nSearle\u2019s terminology, merely saying something (\u2018I\ndo\u2019) counts as something else (becoming a wife). An important\nspecies of performatives are declarative speech acts (e.g. saying\n\u2018I declare war\u2019 in a certain context counts as going to\nwar). A key point about performatives appears to be that it is by\nvirtue of a convention that saying such and such in a given context\nbrings the outcome about (Miller 1984). Accordingly, the outcome\ndepends on collective acceptance (in the sense of compliance with the\nconvention) and, indeed, to this extent the outcome is in part\nconstituted by collective acceptance (in this sense). Searle himself\nspeaks of constitutive rules at this point; rules that have the form\n\u2018X counts as Y in context C\u2019 (Searle 2010: 95).\n\nAs mentioned above, Guala denies a central role to constitutive rules.\nAccording to Guala, (following Hindriks 2009), constitutive\nrules are essentially naming devices; they state the conditions of\napplication of theoretical terms used to refer to institutions. For\ninstance, a dollar note (X) counts as money (Y) if it is issued by the\nrelevant authority. Here the Y term simply names a pattern of activity\ngoverned by regulative rules, e.g. \u2018Use the note as a medium of\nexchange\u2019. Other theorists who have, in effect, reduced or\notherwise down-graded Searle\u2019s notion of constitutive rules in\nfavour of regulative rules, including systems of regulative rules are\nMiller (2001: 191) and, more recently, Ludwig (2017).\nAccording to Ludwig, constitutive rules are regulative rules such that\nintentionally following them constitutes the activity they govern\n(Ludwig 2017: 262).\n\nFavourite examples of collective acceptance theorists are money,\npolitical authorities, and, most importantly for our concerns here,\nso-called status roles. Thus Tuomela says (2007: 183):\n\u201c\u2018performative\u2019 collective acceptance must have been\nin place for squirrel pelt to become money.\u201d And Searle says\n(2010: 101): \u201cBut when we count pieces of paper of a\nparticular sort as twenty-dollar bills we are making them twenty\ndollar bills by Declaration. The Declaration makes something the case\nby counting it as, that, by declaring it to be, the case.\u201d The\nproblem with this view of money (in its role purely as a medium of\nexchange) is that Tuomela\u2019s invocation of performatives and\nSearle\u2019s invocation of declaratives seem unnecessary. The fact\nthat squirrel pelts, shells or bit of inked paper are used as mediums\nof exchange is sufficient for them to be money. For a squirrel pelt to\ncount as money or to be treated as money or to be collectively\naccepted as money is just for it to be used as a medium of exchange.\nThe notion of collective acceptance either collapses into regular,\ninterdependent, use or it is superfluous. Nor do such informal\nexchange systems necessarily generate deontic properties; if your\nsquirrel pelt is refused as a medium of exchange by someone then your\nexpectation (in the sense of belief with respect to the future) has\nbeen dashed, but no institutional right has been violated (given the\ninformal character of the arrangement). Of course it would add greatly\nto the stability of this arrangement if these pelts (or, more likely,\nbits of inked paper) were somehow authorised as an official medium of\nexchange, and if a (rule constituted) system of institutional rights\nand duties in relation to the exchange of these shells was introduced\nand enforced. However, such a deontological structure does not seem to\nbe a necessary feature of the system of exchange (Miller 2001: 182;\nGuala 2016: 40). Naturally, it could be replied to this that,\nnevertheless, institutional rights and duties, as opposed to the\nunderlying functionality of the arrangement, requires performatives\nand, specifically, declaratives. \n\nWhat of political authorities? Searle says (1995: 91\u20132):\n\u201cMore spectacular examples are provided by the collapse of the\nSoviet empire in the annus mirabilis, 1989.\u2026 It collapsed when\nthe system of status-functions was no longer accepted.\u201d However,\nsuch collapses of political systems seem to demonstrate a special\nfeature of institutional positions of authority rather than of\ninstitutional roles in general. Specifically, it is a necessary\ncondition of wielding authority that subordinates obey the commands of\ntheir superior. Presumably, they do so because they believe the person\nin question has a moral right to be obeyed and/or they fear sanctions\nif they do not obey (Miller 2001: 189).\n\nWhat of status roles, i.e. institutional roles, in general? These are\nthe most important for our purposes in this entry. According to Searle\n(see also Ludwig 2017: Chapter 8), institutions necessarily involve\nwhat he calls status-functions, and something has a\nstatus-function\u2014as opposed to a mere function\u2014if it has,\nor those who use it have, deontic properties (institutional rights and\nduties) and, therefore, deontic powers (Searle 2018). Thus an\northopaedic surgeon has a status-function, and therefore a set of\ndeontic powers, including rights to perform operations and charge\npeople for doing so, and duties not to perform operations he or she is\nnot accredited to perform, e.g. brain surgery. These status-functions,\nand therefore deontic powers, have been created by collectively\naccepted constitutive rules (constitutive rules, as we have seen, have\nfor Searle the general form \u2018X counts as Y in context C\u2019).\nImportantly, as we saw above, according to Searle, constitutive rules\ndo not regulate a pre-existing activity; rather the activity is\ncreated by, and consists in acting in accordance with, constitutive\n(and related regulative) rules. Accordingly, institutional roles are\nof the same general kind as pieces in a game of chess (to use one of\nSearle\u2019s favourite examples (Searle 2018: 305)) and, therefore,\nunlike driving a car (which, according to Searle, pre-exists the\nregulative rules that govern it (Searle 2018: 305)); institutional\nroles and their defining deontic properties, are institutional facts\ncreated by collectively accepted constitutive rules. \n\nThe first point to be made here is that contra Searle many\ninstitutional roles seem more akin to regularly driving a car than to\nchess pieces. The institutional role of surgeon is a case point. The\nability and activity definitive of a surgeon, i.e. cutting and\nstitching human bodies, is evidently logically prior to the\ninstitutional rights and duties that attach to the institutional role\nof a surgeon (Miller 2001: 186). More generally, a surgeon could\nseemingly carry out surgical operations on willing patients\nirrespective not only of whether she was professionally accredited\n(and, therefore, possessed of the requisite institutional rights and\nduties), but also of whether she was widely regarded as a surgeon in\nher community. Consider, for instance, a morally motivated, skilful,\nsurgeon whose full-time job is transplanting hearts in a jurisdiction\nin which organ transplantation is illegal.\n\nIf this is correct then the crucial issue that now arises concerns the\nrelationship between possession of the deontic properties, i.e.\ninstitutional rights and duties, at least in part constitutive of an\ninstitutional role, on the one hand, and the actual ability to\nundertake that role, bearing in mind that the activity is, at least in\nsome cases of institutional roles, logically prior to its\ninstitutional raiment. Specifically, are the institutional rights and\nduties in part definitive of institutional roles, such as that of a\nsurgeon, merely the creation of collectively accepted constitutive\nrules, irrespective of how collective acceptance and constitutive\nrules are understood (see, for instance, Ludwig (2017: Chapter\n8) for a view that derives from, but is somewhat different to,\nSearle\u2019s), or are they based on more than this? For instance,\nare institutional rights and duties in large part based on moral\nconsiderations, such as needs, e.g. the institutional right to perform\nheart transplants is based on the needs of patient for a new heart, as\nper the teleological account of social institutions (section 4 below)?\nOne response favoured by collective acceptance theorists, such as\nTuomela (2013: 126) and Ludwig (2017: 129\u2013130), is to\ninvoke the notion of an explicit or implicit agreement (and,\ntherefore, promise or quasi-promise) as in part constitutive of\ncollective acceptance (because either constitutive of we-intentions or\nof conventions). However, this reliance on the notion of an agreement\nultimately grounds deontic properties on a contractualist moral theory\nand, therefore, brings with it all the objections to such theories,\ne.g. that there typically no explicit agreements and a lack of\nevidence of many implicit agreements.\n3. The Teleological Account of Institutions\n\nAs noted above, the central concept in the teleological account of\nsocial institutions (Miller 2010) is that of joint action. On the\nteleological account, joint actions consist of the intentional\nindividual actions of a number of agents directed to the realisation\nof a collective end. (Note that intentions are not the same things as\nends, e.g. an agent who intentionally and gratuitously raises\nhis arm ex hypothesi has no end or purpose in doing so.)\nImportantly, on the teleological account, a collective\nend\u2014notwithstanding its name\u2014is a species of individual\nend; it is an end possessed by each of the individuals involved in the\njoint action. However it is an end, which is not realised by the\naction of any one of the individuals; the actions of all or most\nrealise the end. So contra anti-reductionist theorists such as\nGilbert, Tuomela and Searle, the teleological account holds that joint\nactions can be analysed in terms of individualist notions. A second\nmajor point of differentiation from collective acceptance accounts is\nthat on the teleological account conative notions, such as\nwe-intentions and, more relevantly, collective ends, cannot in and of\nthemselves generate deontic properties, specifically institutional\nrights and duties. Accordingly, the basis for deontic properties must\nlie elsewhere. As we shall see, on the teleological account, the basis\nfor deontological properties is to be found in large part in the\ncollective goods provided by institutions.\n\nCollective ends can be unconsciously pursued, and have not necessarily\nbeen at any time explicitly formulated in the minds of those pursuing\nthem; collective ends can be implicit in the behaviour and\nattitudes of agents without ceasing to be ends as such. Further, in\nthe case of a collective end pursued over a long period of time, e.g.\nby members of an institution over generations, the collective end can\nbe latent at a specific point in time, i.e. it is not\nactually being pursued, explicitly or implicitly, at that point in\ntime. However, it does not thereby cease to be an end of that\ninstitution\u2014which is to say, of those persons\u2014even at\nthose times when it is not being pursued.\n\nAs we saw above, organisations consist of an (embodied) formal\nstructure of interlocking roles. These roles can be defined\nin terms of tasks, regularities in action and the like. Moreover,\nunlike social groups, organisations are individuated by the kind of\nactivity which they undertake, and also by their characteristic\nends. So we have governments, universities, business\ncorporations, armies, and so on. Perhaps governments have as an end or\ngoal the ordering and leading of societies, universities the end of\ndiscovering and disseminating knowledge, and so on (Miller 2010: Part\nB). Here it is important to reiterate that these ends are, firstly,\ncollective ends and, secondly, often the latent and/or implicit\n(collective) ends of individual institutional actors.\n\nOn the teleological account, a further defining feature of\norganisations is that organisational action typically consists in,\nwhat has elsewhere been termed, a layered structure of joint\nactions. One illustration of the notion of a layered structure of\njoint actions is an armed force fighting a battle. Suppose at an\norganisation level a number of \u201cactions\u201d are severally\nnecessary and jointly sufficient to achieve some collective end. Thus\nthe \u201cactions\u201d of the mortar squad destroying enemy gun\nemplacements, the flight of military planes providing air-cover and\nthe infantry platoon taking and holding the ground might be severally\nnecessary and jointly sufficient to achieve the collective end of\ndefeating the enemy; as such these \u201cactions\u201d constitute a\njoint action. Call each of these \u201cactions\u201d level-two\nactions. Suppose, in addition, that each of these level-two\n\u201cactions\u201d is itself\u2014at least in part\u2014a joint\naction whose component actions are severally necessary and jointly\nsufficient for the performance of the level-two \u201caction\u201d\nin question. Call these component actions, level-one actions. So the\ncollective end of the level-one actions is the performance of the\nlevel-two \u201caction\u201d. Thus the individual members of the\nmortar squad jointly operate the mortar in order to realise the\ncollective end of destroying enemy gun emplacements. Each pilot,\njointly with the other pilots, strafes enemy soldiers in order to\nrealise the collective end of providing air-cover for their advancing\nfoot soldiers. Finally, the set of foot soldiers jointly advance in\norder to take and hold the ground vacated by the members of the\nretreating enemy force. The actions of each of the individual foot\nsoldiers, mortar squad members and individual pilots are level-one\nactions.\n\nOn the teleological account a further feature of many social\ninstitutions is their use of joint institutional mechanisms.\nExamples of joint institutional mechanisms are the device of tossing a\ncoin to resolve a dispute and voting to elect a candidate to political\noffice.\n\nJoint institutional mechanisms consist of: (a) a complex of\ndifferentiated but interlocking actions (the input to the mechanism);\n(b)the result of the performance of those actions (the output of the\nmechanism), and; (c) the mechanism itself. Thus a given agent might\nvote for a candidate. He will do so only if others also vote. But\nfurther to this, there is the action of the candidates, namely, that\nthey present themselves as candidates. That they present themselves as\ncandidates is (in part) constitutive of the input to the voting\nmechanism. Voters vote for candidates. So there is\ninterlocking and differentiated action (the input). Further there is\nsome result (as opposed to consequence) of the joint action; the joint\naction consisting of the actions of putting oneself forward as a\ncandidate and of the actions of voting. The result is that some\ncandidate, say, Barack Obama is voted in (the output). That there is a\nresult is (in part) constitutive of the mechanism. That to receive the\nmost number of votes is to be voted in, is (in part) constitutive of\nthe voting mechanism. Moreover that Obama is voted in is not a\ncollective end of all the voters. (Although it is a collective end of\nthose who voted for Obama.) However, that the one who gets the most\nvotes\u2014whoever that happens to be\u2014is voted in is a\ncollective end of all the voters, including those who voted for some\ncandidate other than Obama. \n\nIf the end realised in joint action, and organisational action in\nparticular, is not merely a collective end, but also a collective\ngood, then moral properties may well be generated. In the first place,\nthe collective good might consist in an aggregate of basic human needs\nthat have been met, as in the case of food producers, schools,\nhospitals and police organisations. But, arguably, such needs generate\nmoral obligations; other things being equal, the desperately poor (for\nexample) morally ought to be assisted by the ongoing, organised joint\naction of those able to assist.\n\nIn the second place\u2014at the, so to speak, production, as opposed\nto the consumption, end of joint action\u2014the realisation of\ncollective ends that are also collective goods may well generate joint\nmoral rights. It is easy to see why some agents, and not other agents,\nwould have a right to such a good; they are the ones responsible for\nits existence, or continued existence. In this connection consider the\nmanagers and workers in a factory that produces cars which are sold\nfor profit. Managers and workers in the factory\u2014but not\nnecessarily others\u2014have a joint moral right to be remunerated\nfrom the sales of the cars that they jointly produced\u2014and not\nsimply on the basis of some contractual arrangement that they have\nentered into. It is also clear that if one participating agent has a\nmoral right to the good, then\u2014other things being equal\u2014so\ndo the others. That is, there is interdependence of moral rights with\nrespect to the good. Moreover, these moral rights generate correlative\nmoral duties on the part of others to respect these rights. Naturally\nthese prior joint right and duties can be, and are, institutionalised\nincluding by way of contract based legal rights and duties that to\nsome extent respect the relative contributions made by the\nparticipants. \n\nUnlike the collective acceptance account the teleological account\nintroduces moral deontology at the ground floor (so to speak) and\ntries to generate institutional deontology on the back of this prior\nmoral deontology, e.g. institutional moral rights are\ninter-subjectively believed moral rights. As such it is open to the\ncharge that moral deontology presupposes institutional forms. The\nconcept of a right, for example, might be held to make no sense\noutside an institutional environment. Indeed, Searle (2010:\nChapter 8) offers this kind of argument, including in relation to\nhuman rights (Burman 2018). Another objection is that many members of\norganisations do not have the collective ends of the institution of\nwhich they are members as an end; rather they perform their roles\nbecause they are paid to do so. However, joint actions can be\nperformed for individual ends; there can be quasi-joint actions\n(Miller 2001: 180)\n\nIn this section the teleological account of social institutions has\nbeen elaborated. In the following section issues of institutions and\nagency are discussed.\n4. Institutions and Agency\n\nAs mentioned above, it is convenient to conceive of social\ninstitutions as possessed of three dimensions, namely, structure,\nfunction and culture. While the structure, function and culture of an\ninstitution provide a framework within which individuals act, they do\nnot fully determine the actions of individuals. There are a number of\nreasons why this is so. For one thing, rules, norms and ends cannot\ncover every contingency that might arise; for another, rules, norms\nand so on, themselves need to be interpreted and applied. Moreover,\nchanging circumstances and unforeseeable problems make it desirable to\nvest institutional role occupants (individually or jointly) with\ndiscretionary powers to rethink and adjust old rules, norms, and ends,\nand sometimes elaborate new ones (Warwick 1981)\n\nLegitimate individual or collective discretionary activity undertaken\nwithin an institution is typically facilitated by a rational internal\nstructure\u2014including role structure\u2014, and by a rational\ninstitutional culture. By rational, it is here meant internally\nconsistent, as well as rational in the light of the\ninstitution\u2019s purposes. For instance, a hierarchical role\nstructure might be rational in one institution, e.g. a defence force,\nbut not another, e.g. a university. Again, a culture of greed might\nundermine an institution\u2019s purposes, e.g. in a financial\ninstitution.\n\nAside from the internal dimensions of an institution, there are its\nexternal relationships, including its relationships to other\ninstitutions. In particular, there is the extent of the independence\nof an institution from other institutions, including government. One\nthinks here of the separation of powers among the legislative,\nexecutive and judicial institutions in the United States of America\nand elsewhere.\n\nIt should be noted that, strictly speaking, independence is not the\nsame thing as autonomy, but is rather a necessary condition for it. An\ninstitution possessed of independence from other institutions might\nnevertheless lack autonomy, if it lacked the kinds of rational\ninternal structure and culture noted above. Indeed, internal conflicts\ncan paralyse an institution to the point where it becomes incapable of\npursuing its institutional purposes, e.g. a bitterly divided\nlegislature.\n\nGranted that institutional actors have a degree of discretionary\npower, nevertheless, they are constrained by institutional structure,\nand specifically the role structure, of the role that they occupy. As\nis often pointed out, institutional structure also enables the action\nof institutional actors (Giddens 1984). Police officers, for example,\nhave significant powers not possessed by ordinary citizens. \n\nA much-discussed issue in the philosophical literature that arises at\nthis point concerns the alleged agency of of institutions;\nspecifically, the view that institutions (and other collective\nentities) per se are agents. As mentioned, advocates of this view in\none form or another, include French (1984), Gilbert (1989), List and\nPettit (2011), Tollefsen (2015) and Epstein (2015).\n\nList and Pettit provide an argument based on judgement aggregation in\nsupport of their view and suggest, further, that the actions of\ncollective entities supervene on those of their members. The judgement\naggregation paradox (see also Copp 2007), are supposed to demonstrate\nthe existence of processes of irreducibly collective reasoning from\nwhich irreducibly collective intentions and judgements\u2014and,\nultimately, group minds\u2014are inferred. (See Szigeti 2013) for\ncounter-arguments to List and Pettit). A key question is whether the\nexamples provided by Copp, by List and Pettit and by others can be\naccommodated by an analysis which does not help itself to irreducibly\nprocesses of collective reasoning, e.g. the notion of joint\n(epistemic) institutional mechanisms (Miller 2018) mentioned in\nsection 3. Consider the well-known tenure committee example (Copp\n2007).\n\nThe tenure committee consists of three members and the criteria for\nassessment are excellence in teaching, research and administration.\nEach of the members of the committee believes the candidate is\nexcellent in only two of the areas. However, the committee can reach\nits conclusion to deny or confirm tenure on the basis of a\nconclusion-driven procedure or a premise-driven procedure. If the\nconclusion-driven procedure is used tenure will be denied since on\nthis procedure each votes to confirm tenure only if he or she judges\nthe candidate to be excellent in all three areas. If the\npremise-driven procedure is used tenure will be confirmed. For on this\nprocedure each votes on each criterion and if a majority judge the\ncandidate to be excellent on that criterion the candidate is deemed to\nbe excellent on that criterion. Since with respect to each of the\ncriteria a majority vote that the candidate is excellent, the result\nis that the candidate is deemed to be excellent in all three areas.\nThe adherents of irreducibly collectivist reasoning claim that that\nthe choice between the premise-driven way and the conclusion-driven\nway is a choice between submitting to individual reason and submitting\nto collective reason. However, both procedures involve a voting\nprocedure and to that extent involve a joint institutional mechanism\nanalysable in wholly individualist terms (as per section 3 above). In\naddition, both procedures involve a process of reasoning from premises\nto a conclusion; however, this process is one of logic, and in the\ntenure example it is a process carried out in the heads of the members\nof the tenure committee. In the premise-driven procedure the premises\nfrom which each committee member will individually infer the\nconclusion that the candidate is excellent in all three areas are\ndetermined by voting, whereas in the case of the conclusion-driven\nprocedure the conclusion that the candidate is not excellent in all\nthree areas is inferred from premises that have been individually\nchosen. Accordingly, there is no process of collective reasoning as\nsuch in the use of either procedure.\n\nSupposing institutions, in particular, are collective agents there\nremains the question of the relationship between these collective\nagents and their human members. The favoured relationship, e.g. by\nList and Pettit, is that of supervenience. Epstein has provided\ndetailed arguments against the supervenience thesis. He distinguishes\nbetween what he refers as the grounding and the anchoring of social\nphenomena, including institutions and institutional objects, and\nutilizes H. L. A. Hart\u2019s distinction between primary rules and\nsecondary rule in doing so (Hart 1961). Roughly speaking, primary\nrules directly govern the behaviour of citizens, e.g. laws against\nmurder. Secondary rules determine what the primary rules are, e.g. the\nlegislative processes for enacting primary rules. According to\nEpstein, the grounds of a primary rule against murder consist of facts\nsuch as intentional killing, whereas secondary rules, e.g. the\nlegislative enactment process, would anchor the primary rule. Let us\nnow see how this grounding/anchoring distinction works by way of the\nexample of the Supreme Court of the US. According to Epstein (2015:\n223), the fact that the Supreme Court issues a particular opinion is\ngrounded in facts such as that its members voted in particular\nways. Moreover, their powers, e.g. to vote, are anchored in part by\nthe US Constitution and the Judiciary Acts (which established the US\ncourts). However, says Epstein, some grounding facts are external to\nfacts about the members of the institution in question, e.g. external\nto facts about the justices of the Supreme Court.  Therefore, the\nactions of a group depend on more than the actions of the members of\nthe group. For instance, the issuance of an opinion by the Supreme\nCourt depends on more than the votes and other actions of the justices\nof the Supreme Court, it also depends on the constraints on their\nactions (Epstein 2015: 227), e.g. constraints imposed by,\ni.e. anchored in, the US Constitution and the Judicial Acts. Epstein\ntakes this dependence of the actions of the Supreme Court on external\nfacts, and specifically the actions of persons other than the members\nof the Supreme Court, to undermine the supervenience claim. This is\nplausible. However, since the argument at this point simply assumes\nthat the Supreme Court per se performs actions, it does not\ndemonstrate that the actions of the Supreme Court are not simply the\nactions of the members of the Supreme Court. For if we assume contra\nEpstein that the Supreme Court per se is not an agent and does not\nperform actions, then his argument merely demonstrates what is clearly\ncorrect, namely, that the actions of the members of the Supreme Court\nare to some extent dependent on the actions of persons other than the\nmembers of the Supreme Court, e.g. the framers of the US Constitution\nand of the Judicial Acts. Indeed, arguably, it is the view that\ninstitutions per se are agents that is the root of the problem and the\ndifficulties identified by Epstein that arise from positing the\nsupervenience relation merely symptoms. For if institutions are not\nagents per se and, therefore, do not perform actions and are not\npossessed of mental states, then there is no need to posit this\nsupervenience relation. \n\nAnother important issue in relation to agency concerns the nature of\nthe relationship between institutional structure and the agency of\ninstitutional actors (Pleasants 2019). More specifically, a question\narises as to whether or not one of these is logically prior to the\nother (or whether neither is). Thus some theorists, e.g. Emile\nDurkheim (1964) are held to conceive of structure as sui\ngeneris in relation to individual agency; and indeed, at least in the\ncase of structuralists such as Althusser (1971), explanatory\nof human \u2018agency\u2019. The proposition of structuralists such\nas Althusser is that institutional structures (in the sense of a\nstructure of social roles and social norms) are a basic, non-reducible\nfeature of the world and the actions, values, self-images and the like\nof individual human agents must conform to these structures because\nindividual agency, properly understood, is in fact constituted by such\nstructures. An individual human agent is simply the repository of the\nroles and values of the institutions in which the \u2018agent\u2019\nlives his or her life. Other theorists, e.g., arguably Max Weber\n(1949) and methodological individualists, conceive of\ninstitutional structure as simply an abstraction from the habitual and\ninterdependent actions of individual human beings actors. Social\nreality is wholly compromised of individual human agents and their\nongoing, patterned interactions; there is no structure as such.\n(Theorists such as Durkheim occupy a mid-position in which there is\nboth sui generis structure and non-reducible agency; such theorists\nnow confront the problem of conflict between structure and individual\nagency\u2014which overrides which?) \n\nIn relation to this issue Anthony Giddens (1976 and 1984) has\nattempted to reconcile the felt reality of individual agency with the\napparent need to posit some form of institutional structure that\ntranscends individual agency.\n\nAccording to Giddens, structure is both constituted by human agency\nand is the medium in which human action takes place (Giddens 1976, p.\n121). This seems to mean, firstly, that structure is nothing other\nthan the repetition over time of the related actions of many\ninstitutional actors. So the structure consists of: (i) the habitual\nactions of each institutional agent; (ii) the set of such agents; and\n(iii) the relationship of interdependence between the actions of any\none agent and the actions of the other agents. But it means, secondly,\nthat this repetition over time of the related actions of many agents\nprovides not just the context, but the framework, within which the\naction of a single agent at a particular spatio-temporal point is\nperformed. Structure qua framework constrains any given\nagent\u2019s action at a particular spatio-temporal point. (In\naddition, and as Giddens is at pains to point out, structure qua\nframework enables various actions not otherwise possible,\ne.g. linguistic structure enables speech acts to be performed.)\n\nThis seems plausible as far as it goes; however, we are owed an\naccount of the interdependence among the actions of different\nagents. On a teleological account of institutions this interdependence\nis in large part generated by the ends of the institutions.\n\n\nHere we need to remind ourselves of a characteristic feature of\ninstitutions, namely, their reproductive capacity. Institutions\nreproduce themselves, or at least are disposed to do so. On the\nteleological account of institutions, this is in large part because\nthe members of institutions strongly identify with the institutional\nends and social norms that are definitive of those institutions, and\ntherefore make relatively long term commitments to institutions and\ninduct others into those institutions.\n\nHowever, it has been suggested by, for example, Roy Bhaskar (1979: 44)\nthat this reproduction of institutions is the unintended result of the\nfree actions of institutional actors in institutional settings. (See\nalso Merton 1968: Part 1 Section 3.) By way of support for this\nproposition Bhaskar claims that people do not marry to reproduce the\nnuclear family or work to reproduce the capitalist system. \n\nThe first point to be made by way of response to Bhaskar is that even\nif the reproduction of an institution was an unintended\nconsequence of the intentional participation of agents in that\ninstitution it would not follow that those agents did not have various\nother institutional outcomes as an end. For example, members of a\nbusiness might have the maximisation of profit as an explicit\ncollective end, even if the reproduction of the company was not\nintended by anyone. \n\nThe second point is that having an outcome as an implicit\nand/or latent collective end is not equivalent to\nindividually explicitly intending to bring about that outcome. But it\nis the former, and not the latter that is in question. What is the\nevidence for the former in relation to Bhaskar\u2019s chosen\nexamples?\n\nConsider a market-based institution, such as a company. Assume that\nthe owners and managers of this company work to maintain the existence\nof their company and\u2014through training, recruitment and so\non\u2014to ensure that it continues beyond their retirement or\nresignation. Moreover, assume that in their ongoing interaction with\ncustomers and with other businesses, they knowingly\u2014and in the\ncase of sales and marketing personnel, intentionally\u2014establish\nand maintain specific economic relationships. More generally\u2014let\nus assume\u2014they express, often explicitly, not only their\ncommitment to their own business, but to the market system in general.\nFurther, let us assume that where appropriate and possible, they\nassist in the maintenance and further development of that system, e.g.\nby voting for a market oriented political party. Now consider a set of\nsuch companies. Arguably\u2014given these fairly plausible\nassumptions\u2014each of owner and manager of any of these companies\nhas\u2014jointly with the others\u2014an implicit and (much of the\ntime) latent collective end to reproduce the market system.\n\nFurther, there are institutions, such as schools and churches, and\npolicymaking bodies, such as governments, that are explicitly\nengaged in the enterprise of reproducing a variety of social\ninstitutions other than themselves. They contribute to the\nreproduction of various social institutions by propagating the\n\u201cideology\u201d of these institutions, but also by advocating\nand, in the case of government, by implementing specific policies to\nensure the reproduction of these institutions.\n\nDoubtless, unintended consequences\u2014or, more precisely,\nconsequences not aimed at as an end\u2014have an important role in\nthe life and for that matter, the death, of institutions (Hirschman\n1970). Such consequences might include ones produced by evolutionary\nstyle causal mechanisms, or ones involved in so-called \u201chidden\nhand\u201d mechanisms. (Albeit, as we saw above, \u201chidden\nhand\u201d mechanisms are often the product of deliberate\ninstitutional design, and so their consequences are in a general sense\naimed at by the designers, if not by the participating institutional\nactors themselves.)\n\nMore specifically, habitual action is a necessary feature of\nindividual and collective\u2014including institutional\u2014life;\nand each single action performed on the basis of a habit, contributes\nin turn, and often unintentionally, to the maintenance and\nreinforcement of that habit. So the fact that institutional actors\nnecessarily act in large part on the basis of habit means that many of\ntheir actions unintentionally contribute to the reproduction of the\ninstitution. However, this is consistent with a teleological account\nof social institutions\u2014since, as noted above, there are outcomes\nother than institutional reproduction, and many of these are outcomes\nthat are clearly aimed at. Moreover, it is consistent even with a\nteleological explanation of the reproduction of social institutions,\nsince the establishment and periodic justificatory review of\nhabits are themselves susceptible to teleological explanation.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Althusser, Louis, 1971, <em>Lenin and Philosophy and Other\nEssays</em> trans.
