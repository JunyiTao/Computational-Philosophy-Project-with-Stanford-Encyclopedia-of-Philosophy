    "main_text": "What is an obligation to oneself?\n1. What is an obligation to oneself?\n\nThe traditional examples of obligations to oneself are a hodgepodge,\nbut they basically come in two kinds: self-care and self-respect\n(Allen 2013, 854). Self-care is a matter of promoting our own\ninterests \u2013 pursuing our dreams, minding our health, preserving\nour lives. Self-respect, meanwhile, is less about what is good for us,\nand more about what is proper or dignified; think of prohibitions on\nsafe and profitable sex work, or taboos around painless suicide even\nin the shadow of an agonizing terminal disease. As these examples\nshow, self-care and self-respect can be in tension.\n\u201cDisrespecting\u201d oneself might be the best way to escape a\nmiserable death or a life in poverty.\n\nThe tension here is so deep that many philosophers claim to only\nbelieve in one of these two kinds of duty, while totally rejecting the\nother. At one point in his Lectures on Ethics [LE],\nKant suggests that we only owe ourselves respect:\n\u201cself-regarding duties\u2026have nothing to do with well-being\nand our temporal happiness\u201d (LE\n27:341).[1]\nUtilitarians, who think morality is all about well-being, are open at\nmost to duties of self-care; they do not share the Kantians\u2019\nconcerns about ending one\u2019s life or selling access to\none\u2019s body when the result is greater well-being overall (see,\ne.g., Meiland 1963).\n\nWith such stark disagreement, it is natural to wonder if the debate\nhere is really focused on a single concept of \u201cobligations to\noneself.\u201d In fact, it is often not. The variety in the examples\nreflects a more basic variety in concepts. The most crucial\ndistinction here \u2013 essential to everything ever written on\nduties to oneself \u2013 is between an obligation owed to\noneself, and one merely regarding oneself.\n\nSuppose you promise your friend to stop wearing tacky hats. As a\nresult of the promise, you owe it to your friend to dress better; in\nthis sense, the obligation is \u201cto\u201d your friend, not to\nyou. But this is still an obligation regarding you, in the sense that\nit concerns what you do to yourself. You are the one whose headgear is\nat issue. (This sort of example is common in the literature; see,\ne.g., Mavrodes 1964, 165\u201366; Timmermann 2006, 506.)\n\nIt is an open question what an obligation to someone consists in, if\nit is something over and above mere regard (see Thompson 2004 on\n\u201cbipolar normativity,\u201d Darwall 2006 on\n\u201csecond-personal\u201d address, and Schofield 2022 [Other\nInternet Resources]). \u201cInterest theories\u201d say that an\nobligation to you is somehow linked to what is good for you (see,\ne.g., Raz 1986, chap. 5). \u201cStanding theories,\u201d which are\nmore popular in writings on obligations to oneself, say that\nobligations to you put you in control. For Gilbert (2018) and Darwall\n(2006, 18), the distinctive thing is that you have the standing to\ndemand what is owed to you. For Schofield (2021, 52), the key is that\nyou get \u201ca rightful say.\u201d For Steiner (2013), you have the\npower to waive the obligation via your powers of consent.\n\nSuffice it to say, the exact essence of an obligation to oneself is\nstill up for debate. By contrast, everyone knows what self-regarding\nobligations are, and everyone agrees that we might have them \u2013\nduties to maintain one\u2019s health so as to take care of\none\u2019s family; to wear a mask to avoid spreading contagion; and\nso on. Indeed, it is hard to imagine an obligation that\nisn\u2019t somehow self-regarding.\n\nIt is far more controversial to say we have bona fide obligations to\nourselves \u2013 that is, owed to ourselves, strictly speaking, just\nas you might owe it to your friend to keep your promise. The idea of\nliterally owing something to oneself seems to imply that we have\nrights against ourselves, along with the power to release ourselves\nfrom duties (see \u00a72, below). To avoid this paradox, many\ntraditional \u201cobligations to oneself\u201d have been recast as,\nor replaced with, obligations merely regarding oneself. Aristotle\nargues that suicide is not an \u201cinjustice towards oneself,\u201d\nbut only towards the state that one is supposed to serve (1138a\n4\u20131138b 11). Some argue that self-care is not owed to oneself,\nor even to others; it is obligatory only in the sense that we have to\ndo it. (It is an \u201cundirected\u201d rather than a\n\u201cdirected\u201d obligation.) And the duty to develop\none\u2019s talents might be seen as part of a duty to promote the\ngood of others: think of a lifeguard swimming laps or a surgeon doing\nhand exercises.\n\nAnother way around the paradox is to say that obligations to oneself\ndon\u2019t imply any quixotic power of self-release. To make this\nview work, we need some way of interpreting \u201cobligations to\noneself\u201d so that they aren\u2019t quite like the legalistic\nobligations we get from promises and contracts. Some say\n\u201cobligations\u201d to oneself are in some sense non-legal;\nothers say one can owe things \u201cto\u201d oneself only in an\nattenuated sense; and some even consider shifting the referent of\n\u201coneself\u201d \u2013 perhaps we only owe things to our future\nselves, or one aspect of our psyche owes it to another.\n\nMuch as the Liar Paradox shaped modern theories of truth, the threat\nof paradox has profoundly shaped our theories of obligations to\noneself. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the paradox before tracing\nits influence on contemporary work.\n",
