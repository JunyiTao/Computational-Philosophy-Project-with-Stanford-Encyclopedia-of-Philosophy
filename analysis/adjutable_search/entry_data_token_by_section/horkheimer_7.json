    "main_text": "The Critique of Reason and the Domination of Nature || The Critique of Instrumental Reason\n4.1 The Critique of Instrumental Reason\n\nIt is noteworthy that the text of Eclipse would eventually be\npublished in German as \u201cZur Kritik der instrumentellen\nVernunft\u201d (\u201cOn the Critique of Instrumental\nReason\u201d). Both Eclipse and Dialectic are\nnuanced texts that present a number of themes, but if there is one\noverarching theme to the work from the 40s it is, as that German title\nsuggests, the critical description of how reason collapses into\nirrationality through its emphasis on instrumental concerns. What is\nat stake here is made most clear by the first chapter of\nEclipse, which is straightforwardly titled \u201cMeans and\nEnds.\u201d Instrumental reason is interested only in determining the\nmeans to a goal, without reasoning about ends in themselves. In\nDialectic, the Enlightenment is largely equated with the\nadvance of instrumental reason, and through instrumental reason,\nEnlightenment turns against itself. This is noted in the very\nbeginning of the text: \u201cEnlightenment, understood in the widest\nsense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human\nbeings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly\nenlightened earth is radiant with triumphant calamity\u201d\n(p.1).\n\nWhile the strong emphasis on instrumental reason\u2019s domination of\nnature (which will be more fully discussed in \u00a74.2) is new to the\nwork of the 1940s, it picks up on themes present in Horkheimer\u2019s\nearlier work. A prominent component (particularly in\nDialectic) of the critique of instrumental reason is a\ncritique of formalistic rationality, which evokes the criticism of the\nCartesian mathematical method in \u201cTraditional and Critical\nTheory.\u201d On the face of it, one might question the necessary\nlink between \u201cformal\u201d and \u201cinstrumental.\u201d But\nHorkheimer and Adorno equate formalism with the drive to make nature\ncalculable, and calculability is assimilated to usefulness. Thus\nformalistic reason becomes a species instrumental reason. Along\nsimilar lines, the critique of positivism is repeated in\nEclipse (pp. 40\u201362). All parts of nature that cannot be\ncalculated and formalized fall out of the Enlightenment\u2019s\nscientific picture of the world. This scientific picture is further\nreproduced through activities which seek to dominate nature, thus\ninstrumental-scientific activity creates a reality to fit this\npicture. The inexorable drive of instrumental reason causes this\ndistorted picture to be seen as the only true picture of the world\n(Horkheimer 1947a p. 33).\n\nMoreover, all elements of society, not just scientific research, are\ntouched by the progress of instrumental rationality. Motivated by\nself-preservation, people seek protection from various powerful groups\n(sometimes called \u201crackets,\u201d see Schmid Noerr 2002, and\nStirk 1992 ch. 6). Instrumental rationality causes society to fragment\ninto these various competing cliques. But this fragmentation is\nattended by cultural homogenization, as displayed by the chapter in\nDialectic titled \u201cThe Culture Industry: Enlightenment\nas Mass Deception.\u201d The general thrust of that chapter is that\ninstrumental rationality has assimilated culture to an industrial\nmodel, which leads to a leveling and homogenizing of that culture. At\npoints, this homogenizing move is described as though it is\nnecessarily all-encompassing, as when the authors write that\n\u201canyone who resists can survive only by being incorporated. Once\nregistered as diverging from the culture industry, they belong to it\nas the land reformer does to capitalism\u201d (p. 104).\n\nEclipse also presents a slightly different view of\ninstrumental reason, which is equated with \u201csubjective\nreason,\u201d and contrasted with \u201cobjective\n reason.\u201d[5]\n At the beginning of \u201cMeans and Ends,\u201d Horkheimer notes\nthat \u201cthe average man will say that reasonable things are things\nthat are obviously useful,\u201d and then notes that it is through\n\u201cclassification, inference, and deduction\u2026the abstract\nfunctioning of the thinking mechanism,\u201d that one is to determine\nwhat is thus reasonable (p. 3). Usefulness is further equated with\nwhatever works in favor of one\u2019s self-preservation. This is why\ninstrumental reason is subjective reason; it is thought oriented to\nthe subject\u2019s preservation. Objective reason (which Horkheimer\nlargely associates with history\u2019s great metaphysical systems\nfrom Plato to German Idealism), on the other hand, seeks to root truth\nand meaning, which should be the proper ends of thought, within some\ncomprehensive totality. Objective reason is interested in ends, while\nsubjective reason is interested only in means. Subjective reason thus\nfalls into incoherence, because as the drive toward self-preservation\nbecomes more and more all encompassing, any real conception of the\nsignificance of what is to be preserved is lost. Subjectivity is so\noriented toward self-preservation that the drive toward\nself-preservation is the only end left. An interesting comparison can\nbe drawn here with the earlier critique of capitalist social\narrangements discussed in \u00a72.2 above. There the similar point is\nmade that the drive to fulfill self interests is ultimately self\ndefeating. But there is a crucial difference; in the works from the\n1930s this is clearly said to be the fault of irrationality, and it is\nsupposed that more rational social arrangements could overcome the\nproblem. In the works from the 1940s, rationality itself is\nimpugned.\n\nThis description of subjective reason thus displays one way in which\nreason works against itself, and so falls into irrationality. A more\nfamous way that this movement is displayed is through one of the\nprimary themes of Dialectic, viz. that \u201cmyth is already\nenlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology\u201d (p.\nxviii). Myth is already enlightenment insofar as myths are already an\nattempt to control nature; \u201cmyth sought to report, to name, to\ntell of origins, but therefore also to narrate, record, explain\u201d\n(p. 5). The interpretation of the Odyssey in Excursus I\nserves as a concrete example of this point. In general, the\nOdyssey maps out and rationally orders ancient myths, and\nshows how humanity, in the person of Odysseus, goes about submitting\nthe mythological to rational control (pp. 35\u201340). Just as myth\nprefigured enlightenment, enlightenment in turn becomes myth insofar\nas our abstract categories become reified, leveling their relation to\nnature and thus making them untrue. This is the case, for example,\nwith the formalistic scientific picture of the world mentioned above;\n\u201cthe mythical scientific respect of peoples for the given\nreality, which they themselves constantly create, finally becomes\nitself a positive fact, a fortress before which even the revolutionary\nimagination feels shamed as utopianism\u201d (p. 33).\n",
