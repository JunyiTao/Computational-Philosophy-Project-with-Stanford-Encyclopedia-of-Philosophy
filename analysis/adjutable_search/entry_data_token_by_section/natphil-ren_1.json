    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy and the Curriculum || Universities and Textbooks\n2.1 Universities and Textbooks\n\nThe Aristotelian natural corpus covered a wide range of\nsubjects in a number of separate texts: while the Physics was\na sort of general work\u2014which appeared to some fifteenth- and\nsixteenth-century authors more metaphysical, even overlapping with the\nMetaphysics\u2014the other treatises represented different\nsections of natural philosophy on particulars. The success and\ninfluence of Aristotelian natural philosophy was due to its centrality\nto university teaching, where it was favored because it covered every\ntopic, like an encyclopedia. Few attempts were made to reconsider\nwhich texts represented the core of the study of natural philosophy in\nthe universities; one remarkable exception was Pierre de la\nRam\u00e9e (1515\u20131572), who put a distinctive emphasis on\nparticular sciences at the expense of study of the Physics.\nPhysics, along with On the Heavens, Meteorology, and\nOn Generation and Corruption, was the main reference for\nnatural philosophy in the traditional curricula of the\nFaculty of Arts. Universities\u2014especially in\nItaly\u2014appointed many lecturers in natural philosophy, who\nusually received high salaries. In the second half of the sixteenth\ncentury, separate chairs of botany, mathematics, and even chemistry\n(in Mantua and Germany), were established. Aristotelian texts were\ntraditionally studied according to the commentaries by Averroes (which\nprovided the internal partition of the texts into sections).\n\nBetween the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the works of other,\nmore ancient commentators on Aristotle were also adopted: those of\nAlexander of Aphrodisias and Simplicius were particularly popular, the\nfirst because of its radical mortalism, the second for its Neoplatonic\nand conciliatory tendencies. The rediscovery of the ancient\ncommentators was accompanied by an increasing reliance on the Greek\ntexts in universities, despite the enduring predominance of medieval\nLatin material. New commentaries also appeared alongside the ancient\nones: practically all of the most prominent professors composed their\nown commentaries to the Aristotelian natural texts, in particular\nbetween the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Usually these\ncommentaries followed the texts according to the Averroistic\ndivisions, but sometimes they were organized in\nquaestiones.\n\nFurthermore, the advent of printing made a large selection of\ntextbooks more widely available: some of them were very short\nintroductions for younger students, others were compendia,\nothers paraphrases (like those by Jacques Lef\u00e8vre\nd\u2019Etaples (1455\u20131536), printed for the first time in\n1492), and still others dialogues (again, Lef\u00e8vre\nd\u2019Etaples created some of the most significant examples). Other\npopular works used for teaching were abridged versions of the\nAristotelian treatises reduced to conclusiones, like the\npopular Textus abbreviatus philosophiae naturalis by the\nFrench theologian Thomas Bricot (d. 1516). There were also many\ndifferent textbooks, which generally followed canonical organizations:\neither they explained the Aristotelian works according to their order\nin the corpus, or they highlighted subjects like principles,\ncauses, movement, infinity, place, void, and time. The famous\nCommentarii Conimbricenses, which from 1594 on became the\nstandard text in the Jesuit curriculum, contains a whole\ncourse on natural philosophy organized as a commentary of the\nAristotelian corpus. Particularly after the second half of the\nsixteenth century, vernacular treatments of Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy also began to circulate, such as the translations by\nAntonio Brucioli (1498\u20131566), the paraphrases by Alessandro\nPiccolomini (1508\u20131579), the summaries by Jean de Champaignac\n(fl. 1595) and Scipion Dupleix (1569\u20131661), and the works by\nCesare Crivellati (1553\u20131640), the latter explicitly addressed\nto university students.\n",
