    "main_text": "A More Detailed General Description || Contrast with Cognitivist Subjectivism\n1.3 Contrast with Cognitivist Subjectivism\n\nIt is useful to contrast non-cognitivism with one particular variety\nof cognitivism in order to more clearly present what the\nnon-cognitivist is claiming. Various versions of cognitivist\nsubjectivism equate moral properties such as rightness with the\nproperty of being approved of by some person or group. To be right is\nto be approved of by the speaker, or the speaker and her friends, or\nthe members of the speaker\u2019s society, or everybody. On many such\nviews, when a speaker says something is right she is in fact saying\nthat she approves, or that she and those like her approve. In one very\ngood sense she would then have expressed her approval \u2013 she said\nthat she approved or that she and her friends did. And, if approval is\na conative rather than a cognitive attitude, we might say that she\nexpressed a non-cognitive attitude. But this by itself is not\nsufficient to make the position non-cognitivist. This variety of\nsubjectivism agrees with one of the positive non-cognitivist theses\n(that moral utterances conventionally express non-cognitive\nattitudes), but it does not agree with either of the essential\nnegative non-cognitivist claims (that the judgments don\u2019t\nexpress beliefs and/or that they are not truth-apt). According to this\nsubjectivist theory, the moral utterance expresses the speaker\u2019s\nbelief that she approves of the action and this has truth conditions\nwhich are also the truth conditions of the sentence uttered. When a\nnon-cognitivist says that a sentence conventionally expresses an\nattitude, she means to contrast the mode of expression with saying\nthat one has the attitude. A simple example gets the idea across. One\ncan express dislike of something by saying that one dislikes it. This\nis the way that a cognitivist subjectivist thinks we express moral\nattitudes. But one can also express dislike of something by booing or\nhissing. This is much like the way some non-cognitivists think we\nexpress moral attitudes. The latter way of expressing an attitude is\ndifferent from the way cognitivist subjectivists think we express\nmoral attitudes because it expresses the attitude without saying that\nwe have the attitude (Barnes 1933; Carnap 1937, 28\u201329.) There is\nfurther discussion of this point in section\n 4.3\n below.\n",
