    "main_text": "Case Studies from Scientific Practice || Causal Connections\n2.2 Causal Connections\n\nThere has been a substantive body of research on learning causal\nrelationships as represented in a causal graph [Spirtes et al. 2000].\nKelly suggested a learning-theoretic analysis of inferring causality\nwhere the evidence is provided in the form of observed significant\ncorrelations among variables of interest (a modern version of\nHume\u2019s \u201cconstant conjunctions\u201d). The following\ninductive method is guaranteed to converge to an empirically adequate\ncausal graph as more and more correlations are observed [Schulte, Luo\nand Greiner 2007].\n\nSuppose we have observed a set of correlations or associations\namong a set of variables of interest.\nSelect a causal graph that explains the observed correlations\nwith a minimum number of direct causal links.\n\n",
