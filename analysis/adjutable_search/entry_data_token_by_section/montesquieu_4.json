    "main_text": "The Spirit of the Laws || Forms of Government\n4.1 Forms of Government\n\n\nMontesquieu holds that there are three types of governments:\nrepublican governments, which can take either democratic or\naristocratic forms; monarchies; and despotisms. Unlike, for instance,\nAristotle, Montesquieu does not distinguish forms of government on the\nbasis of the virtue of the sovereign. The distinction between monarchy\nand despotism, for instance, depends not on the virtue of the monarch,\nbut on whether or not he governs \"by fixed and established laws\" (SL\n2.1). Each form of government has a principle, a set of \"human\npassions which set it in motion\" (SL 3.1); and each can be corrupted\nif its principle is undermined or destroyed.\n\n In a democracy, the people are sovereign. They may govern through\nministers, or be advised by a senate, but they must have the power of\nchoosing their ministers and senators for themselves. The principle of\ndemocracy is political virtue, by which Montesquieu means \"the love of\nthe laws and of our country\" (SL 4.5), including its democratic\nconstitution. The form of a democratic government makes the laws\ngoverning suffrage and voting fundamental. The need to protect its\nprinciple, however, imposes far more extensive requirements. On\nMontesquieu's view, the virtue required by a functioning democracy is\nnot natural. It requires \"a constant preference of public to private\ninterest\" (SL 4.5); it \"limits ambition to the sole desire, to the\nsole happiness, of doing greater services to our country than the rest\nof our fellow citizens\" (SL 5.3); and it \"is a self-renunciation,\nwhich is ever arduous and painful\" (SL 4.5). Montesquieu compares it\nto monks' love for their order: \"their rule debars them from all those\nthings by which the ordinary passions are fed; there remains therefore\nonly this passion for the very rule that torments them. ... the more\nit curbs their inclinations, the more force it gives to the only\npassion left them\" (SL 5.2). To produce this unnatural\nself-renunciation, \"the whole power of education is required\" (SL\n4.5). A democracy must educate its citizens to identify their\ninterests with the interests of their country, and should have censors\nto preserve its mores. It should seek to establish frugality by law,\nso as to prevent its citizens from being tempted to advance their own\nprivate interests at the expense of the public good; for the same\nreason, the laws by which property is transferred should aim to\npreserve an equal distribution of property among citizens. Its\nterritory should be small, so that it is easy for citizens to identify\nwith it, and more difficult for extensive private interests to\nemerge.\n\n Democracies can be corrupted in two ways: by what Montesquieu calls\n\"the spirit of inequality\" and \"the spirit of extreme equality\" (SL\n8.2). The spirit of inequality arises when citizens no longer identify\ntheir interests with the interests of their country, and therefore\nseek both to advance their own private interests at the expense of\ntheir fellow citizens, and to acquire political power over them. The\nspirit of extreme equality arises when the people are no longer\ncontent to be equal as citizens, but want to be equal in every\nrespect. In a functioning democracy, the people choose magistrates to\nexercise executive power, and they respect and obey the magistrates\nthey have chosen. If those magistrates forfeit their respect, they\nreplace them. When the spirit of extreme equality takes root, however,\nthe citizens neither respect nor obey any magistrate. They \"want to\nmanage everything themselves, to debate for the senate, to execute for\nthe magistrate, and to decide for the judges\" (SL 8.2). Eventually the\ngovernment will cease to function, the last remnants of virtue will\ndisappear, and democracy will be replaced by despotism.\n\n In an aristocracy, one part of the people governs the rest. The\nprinciple of an aristocratic government is moderation, the virtue\nwhich leads those who govern in an aristocracy to restrain themselves\nboth from oppressing the people and from trying to acquire excessive\npower over one another. In an aristocracy, the laws should be designed\nto instill and protect this spirit of moderation. To do so, they must\ndo three things. First, the laws must prevent the nobility from\nabusing the people. The power of the nobility makes such abuse a\nstanding temptation in an aristocracy; to avoid it, the laws should\ndeny the nobility some powers, like the power to tax, which would make\nthis temptation all but irresistible, and should try to foster\nresponsible and moderate administration. Second, the laws should\ndisguise as much as possible the difference between the nobility and\nthe people, so that the people feel their lack of power as little as\npossible. Thus the nobility should have modest and simple manners,\nsince if they do not attempt to distinguish themselves from the people\n\"the people are apt to forget their subjection and weakness\" (SL 5.8).\nFinally, the laws should try to ensure equality among the nobles\nthemselves, and among noble families. When they fail to do so, the\nnobility will lose its spirit of moderation, and the government will\nbe corrupted.\n\n In a monarchy, one person governs \"by fixed and established laws\"\n(SL 2.1). According to Montesquieu, these laws \"necessarily suppose the\nintermediate channels through which (the monarch's) power flows: for\nif there be only the momentary and capricious will of a single person\nto govern the state, nothing can be fixed, and, of course, there is no\nfundamental law\" (SL 2.4). These 'intermediate channels' are such\nsubordinate institutions as the nobility and an independent judiciary;\nand the laws of a monarchy should therefore be designed to preserve\ntheir power. The principle of monarchical government is honor. Unlike\nthe virtue required by republican governments, the desire to win honor\nand distinction comes naturally to us. For this reason education has a\nless difficult task in a monarchy than in a republic: it need only\nheighten our ambitions and our sense of our own worth, provide us with\nan ideal of honor worth aspiring to, and cultivate in us the\npoliteness needed to live with others whose sense of their worth\nmatches our own. The chief task of the laws in a monarchy is to\nprotect the subordinate institutions that distinguish monarchy from\ndespotism. To this end, they should make it easy to preserve large\nestates undivided, protect the rights and privileges of the nobility,\nand promote the rule of law. They should also encourage the\nproliferation of distinctions and of rewards for honorable conduct,\nincluding luxuries.\n \n A monarchy is corrupted when the monarch either destroys the\nsubordinate institutions that constrain his will, or decides to rule\narbitrarily, without regard to the basic laws of his country, or\ndebases the honors at which his citizens might aim, so that \"men are\ncapable of being loaded at the very same time with infamy and with\ndignities\" (SL 8.7). The first two forms of corruption destroy the\nchecks on the sovereign's will that separate monarchy from despotism;\nthe third severs the connection between honorable conduct and its\nproper rewards. In a functioning monarchy, personal ambition and a\nsense of honor work together. This is monarchy's great strength and\nthe source of its extraordinary stability: whether its citizens act\nfrom genuine virtue, a sense of their own worth, a desire to serve\ntheir king, or personal ambition, they will be led to act in ways that\nserve their country. A monarch who rules arbitrarily, or who rewards\nservility and ignoble conduct instead of genuine honor, severs this\nconnection and corrupts his government.\n\n In despotic states \"a single person directs everything by his own\nwill and caprice\" (SL 2.1). Without laws to check him, and with no\nneed to attend to anyone who does not agree with him, a despot can do\nwhatever he likes, however ill-advised or reprehensible. His subjects\nare no better than slaves, and he can dispose of them as he sees\nfit. The principle of despotism is fear. This fear is easily\nmaintained, since the situation of a despot's subjects is genuinely\nterrifying. Education is unnecessary in a despotism; if it exists at\nall, it should be designed to debase the mind and break the\nspirit. Such ideas as honor and virtue should not occur to a despot's\nsubjects, since \"persons capable of setting a value on themselves\nwould be likely to create disturbances. Fear must therefore depress\ntheir spirits, and extinguish even the least sense of ambition\" (SL\n3.9). Their \"portion here, like that of beasts, is instinct,\ncompliance, and punishment\" (SL 3.10), and any higher aspirations\nshould be brutally discouraged.\n\n Montesquieu writes that \"the principle of despotic government is\nsubject to a continual corruption, because it is even in its nature\ncorrupt\" (SL 8.10). This is true in several senses. First, despotic\ngovernments undermine themselves. Because property is not secure in a\ndespotic state, commerce will not flourish, and the state will be\npoor. The people must be kept in a state of fear by the threat of\npunishment; however, over time the punishments needed to keep them in\nline will tend to become more and more severe, until further threats\nlose their force. Most importantly, however, the despot's character is\nlikely to prevent him from ruling effectively. Since a despot's every\nwhim is granted, he \"has no occasion to deliberate, to doubt, to\nreason; he has only to will\" (SL 4.3). For this reason he is never\nforced to develop anything like intelligence, character, or\nresolution. Instead, he is \"naturally lazy, voluptuous, and ignorant\"\n(SL 2.5), and has no interest in actually governing his people. He\nwill therefore choose a vizier to govern for him, and retire to his\nseraglio to pursue pleasure. In his absence, however, intrigues\nagainst him will multiply, especially since his rule is necessarily\nodious to his subjects, and since they have so little to lose if their\nplots against him fail. He cannot rely on his army to protect him,\nsince the more power they have, the greater the likelihood that his\ngenerals will themselves try to seize power. For this reason the ruler\nin a despotic state has no more security than his people.\n\n Second, monarchical and republican governments involve specific\ngovernmental structures, and require that their citizens have specific\nsorts of motivation. When these structures crumble, or these\nmotivations fail, monarchical and republican governments are\ncorrupted, and the result of their corruption is that they fall into\ndespotism. But when a particular despotic government falls, it is not\ngenerally replaced by a monarchy or a republic. The creation of a\nstable monarchy or republic is extremely difficult: \"a masterpiece of\nlegislation, rarely produced by hazard, and seldom attained by\nprudence\" (SL 5.14). It is particularly difficult when those who would\nhave both to frame the laws of such a government and to live by them\nhave previously been brutalized and degraded by despotism. Producing a\ndespotic government, by contrast, is relatively straightforward. A\ndespotism requires no powers to be carefully balanced against one\nanother, no institutions to be created and maintained in existence, no\ncomplicated motivations to be fostered, and no restraints on power to\nbe kept in place. One need only terrify one's fellow citizens enough\nto allow one to impose one's will on them; and this, Montesquieu\nclaims, \"is what every capacity may reach\" (SL 5.14). For these\nreasons despotism necessarily stands in a different relation to\ncorruption than other forms of government: while they are liable to\ncorruption, despotism is its embodiment.\n",
