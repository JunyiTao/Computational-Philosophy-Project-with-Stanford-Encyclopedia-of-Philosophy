    "main_text": "Arguments for Dualism || The Modal Argument\n4.3 The Modal Argument\n\n\nThere is an argument, which has roots in Descartes (Meditation\nVI), which is a modal argument for dualism. One might put it as\nfollows:\n\nIt is imaginable that one\u2019s mind might exist without one\u2019s body. \n\n\n\ntherefore\n\nIt is conceivable that one\u2019s mind might exist without one\u2019s body. \n\n\n\ntherefore\n\nIt is possible one\u2019s mind might exist without one\u2019s body. \n\n\n\ntherefore\n\nOne\u2019s mind is a different entity from one\u2019s body.\n\n\n\nThe rationale of the argument is a move from imaginability to real\npossibility. I include (2) because the notion of conceivability has one\nfoot in the psychological camp, like imaginability, and one in the camp\nof pure logical possibility and therefore helps in the transition from\none to the other.\n\n\nThis argument should be distinguished from a similar\n\u2018conceivability\u2019 argument, often known as the \u2018zombie\nhypothesis\u2019, which claims the imaginability and possibility of my\nbody (or, in some forms, a body physically just like it) existing\nwithout there being any conscious states associated with it. (See, for\nexample, Chalmers (1996), 94\u20139.) This latter argument, if sound, would\nshow that conscious states were something over and above physical\nstates. It is a different argument because the hypothesis that\nthe unaltered body could exist without the mind is not the\nsame as the suggestion that the mind might continue to exist without\nthe body, nor are they trivially equivalent. The zombie argument\nestablishes only property dualism and a property dualist might think\ndisembodied existence inconceivable \u2013 for example, if he thought\nthe identity of a mind through time depended on its relation to a body\n(e.g., Penelhum 1970).\n\n\nBefore Kripke (1972/80), the first challenge to such an argument\nwould have concerned the move from (3) to (4). When philosophers\ngenerally believed in contingent identity, that move seemed to them\ninvalid. But nowadays that inference is generally accepted and the\nissue concerns the relation between imaginability and possibility.\nNo-one would nowadays identify the two (except, perhaps, for certain\nquasi-realists and anti-realists), but the view that imaginability is a\nsolid test for possibility has been strongly defended. W. D. Hart\n((1994), 266), for example, argues that no clear example has been\nproduced such that \u201cone can imagine that p (and tell less\nimaginative folk a story that enables them to imagine that p) plus a\ngood argument that it is impossible that p. No such counterexamples\nhave been forthcoming\u2026\u201d This claim is at least contentious.\nThere seem to be good arguments that time-travel is incoherent, but\nevery episode of Star-Trek or Doctor Who shows how\none can imagine what it might be like were it possible.\n\n\nIt is worth relating the appeal to possibility in this argument to\nthat involved in the more modest, anti-physicalist, zombie argument.\nThe possibility of this hypothesis is also challenged, but all that is\nnecessary for a zombie to be possible is that all and only the things\nthat the physical sciences say about the body be true of such a\ncreature. As the concepts involved in such sciences \u2013 e.g.,\nneuron, cell, muscle \u2013 seem to make no reference, explicit or\nimplicit, to their association with consciousness, and are defined in\npurely physical terms in the relevant science texts, there is a very\npowerful prima facie case for thinking that something could meet the\ncondition of being just like them and lack any connection with\nconsciousness. There is no parallel clear, uncontroversial and\nregimented account of mental concepts as a whole that fails to invoke,\nexplicitly or implicitly, physical (e.g., behavioural) states.\n\n\nFor an analytical behaviourist the appeal to imaginability made in\nthe argument fails, not because imagination is not a reliable guide to\npossibility, but because we cannot imagine such a thing, as it is a\npriori impossible. The impossibility of disembodiment is rather like\nthat of time travel, because it is demonstrable a priori, though only\nby arguments that are controversial. The argument can only get under\nway for those philosophers who accept that the issue cannot be settled\na priori, so the possibility of the disembodiment that we can imagine\nis still prima facie open.\n\n\nA major rationale of those who think that imagination is not a safe\nindication of possibility, even when such possibility is not eliminable\na priori, is that we can imagine that a posteriori necessities\nmight be false \u2013 for example, that Hesperus might not be\nidentical to Phosphorus. But if Kripke is correct, that is not a real\npossibility. Another way of putting this point is that there are many\nepistemic possibilities which are imaginable because they are epistemic\npossibilities, but which are not real possibilities. Richard Swinburne\n(1997, New Appendix C), whilst accepting this argument in general, has\ninteresting reasons for thinking that it cannot apply in the mind-body\ncase. He argues that in cases that involve a posteriori necessities,\nsuch as those identities that need discovering, it is because we\nidentify those entities only by their \u2018stereotypes\u2019 (that\nis, by their superficial features observable by the layman) that we can\nbe wrong about their essences. In the case of our experience of\nourselves this is not true.\n\n\nNow it is true that the essence of Hesperus cannot be discovered by\na mere thought experiment. That is because what makes Hesperus Hesperus\nis not the stereotype, but what underlies it. But it does not follow\nthat no one can ever have access to the essence of a substance, but\nmust always rely for identification on a fallible stereotype. One might\nthink that for the person him or herself, while what makes that person\nthat person underlies what is observable to others, it does not\nunderlie what is experienceable by that person, but is given directly in\ntheir own self-awareness.\n\n\nThis is a very appealing Cartesian intuition: my identity as the\nthinking thing that I am is revealed to me in consciousness, it is not\nsomething beyond the veil of consciousness. Now it could be replied to\nthis that though I do access myself as a conscious subject, so\nclassifying myself is rather like considering myself qua\ncyclist. Just as I might never have been a cyclist, I might never have\nbeen conscious, if things had gone wrong in my very early life.\nI am the organism, the animal, which might not have developed\nto the point of consciousness, and that essence as animal is not\nrevealed to me just by introspection.\n\n\nBut there are vital differences between these cases. A cyclist is\nexplicitly presented as a human being (or creature of some\nother animal species) cycling: there is no temptation to think of a\ncyclist as a basic kind of thing in its own right. Consciousness is not\npresented as a property of something, but as the subject itself.\nSwinburne\u2019s claim that when we refer to ourselves we are referring to\nsomething we think we are directly aware of and not to \u2018something\nwe know not what\u2019 that underlies our experience seemingly\n\u2018of ourselves\u2019 has powerful intuitive appeal and could only\nbe overthrown by very forceful arguments. Yet, even if we are not\nreferring primarily to a substrate, but to what is revealed in\nconsciousness, could it not still be the case that there is a necessity\nstronger than causal connecting this consciousness to something\nphysical? To consider this further we must investigate what the limits\nare of the possible analogy between cases of the water-H2O kind, and\nthe mind-body relation.\n\n\nWe start from the analogy between the water stereotype \u2013 how\nwater presents itself \u2013 and how consciousness is given\nfirst-personally to the subject. It is plausible to claim that\nsomething like water could exist without being H2O, but hardly that it\ncould exist without some underlying nature. There is, however,\nno reason to deny that this underlying nature could be\nhomogenous with its manifest nature: that is, it would seem to be\npossible that there is a world in which the water-like stuff is an\nelement, as the ancients thought, and is water-like all the way down.\nThe claim of the proponents of the dualist argument is that this latter\nkind of situation can be known to be true a priori in the case of the\nmind: that is, one can tell by introspection that it is not\nmore-than-causally dependent on something of a radically different\nnature, such as a brain or body. What grounds might one have for\nthinking that one could tell that a priori?\n\n\nThe only general argument that seem to be available for this would be\nthe principle that, for any two levels of discourse, A and\nB, they are more-than-causally connected only if one entails\nthe other a priori. And the argument for accepting this principle\nwould be that the relatively uncontroversial cases of a posteriori\nnecessary connections are in fact cases in which one can argue a\npriori from facts about the microstructure to the manifest facts. In\nthe case of water, for example, it would be claimed that it follows a\npriori that if there were something with the properties\nattributed to H2O by chemistry on a micro level, then that\nthing would possess waterish properties on a macro level. What is\nestablished a posteriori is that it is in fact H2O that\nunderlies and explains the waterish properties round here, not\nsomething else: the sufficiency of the base \u2013 were it to \nobtain \u2013 to explain the phenomena, can be deduced a priori from the\nsupposed nature of the base. This is, in effect, the argument that\nChalmers uses to defend the zombie hypothesis. The suggestion is that\nthe whole category of a posteriori more-than-causally necessary\nconnections (often identified as a separate category of\nmetaphysical necessity) comes to no more than this. If we\naccept that this is the correct account of a posteriori necessities,\nand also deny the analytically reductionist theories that would be\nnecessary for a priori connections between mind and body, as\nconceived, for example, by the behaviourist or the functionalist, does\nit follow that we can tell a priori that consciousness is not\nmore-than-causally dependent on the body?\n\n\nIt is helpful in considering this question to employ a distinction\nlike Berkeley\u2019s between ideas and notions. Ideas are\nthe objects of our mental acts, and they capture \ntransparently \u2013 \u2018by way of image or likeness\u2019 \n(Principles, sect. 27) \u2013 that of which they are the ideas. \nThe self and its faculties\nare not the objects of our mental acts, but are captured only\nobliquely in the performance of its acts, and of these\nBerkeley says we have notions, meaning by this that what we\ncapture of the nature of the dynamic agent does not seem to have the\nsame transparency as what we capture as the normal objects of the\nagent\u2019s mental acts. It is not necessary to become involved in\nBerkeley\u2019s metaphysics in general to feel the force of the claim that\nthe contents and internal objects of our mental acts are grasped with a\nlucidity that exceeds that of our grasp of the agent and the acts\nper se. Because of this, notions of the self perhaps have a\n\u2018thickness\u2019 and are permanently contestable: there seems\nalways to be room for more dispute as to what is involved in that\nconcept. (Though we shall see later, in 5.2.2, that there is a\n\u2018non-thick\u2019 way of taking the Berkeleyan concept of a\nnotion.)\n\n\nBecause \u2018thickness\u2019 always leaves room for dispute, this\nis one of those cases in philosophy in which one is at the mercy of the\narguments philosophers happen to think up. The conceivability argument\ncreates a prima facie case for thinking that mind has no more than\ncausal ontological dependence on the body. Let us assume that one\nrejects analytical (behaviourist or functionalist) accounts of mental\npredicates. Then the above arguments show that any necessary dependence\nof mind on body does not follow the model that applies in other\nscientific cases. This does not show that there may not be other\nreasons for believing in such dependence, for so many of the concepts\nin the area are still contested. For example, it might be argued that\nidentity through time requires the kind of spatial existence that only\nbody can give: or that the causal continuity required by a stream of\nconsciousness cannot be a property of mere phenomena. All these might\nbe put forward as ways of filling out those aspects of our\nunderstanding of the self that are only obliquely, not transparently,\npresented in self-awareness. The dualist must respond to any claim as\nit arises: the conceivability argument does not pre-empt them.\n4.4 From property dualism to substance dualism\n\n\nAll the arguments so far in this section have been either arguments\nfor property dualism only, or neutral between property and substance\ndualism. In this subsection, and in section 4.5 we will consider some\narguments that have been proposed in favour of substance dualism.The\nones in this section can be regarded as preliminaries to that in 4.5\nand they centre on discontent with property dualism in its Humean\nform. \n\n\nHume is generally credited with devising what is known as the \u2018bundle\u2019\ntheory of the self (Treatise Book I, Part IV, section VI),\naccording to which there are mental states, but no further subject or\nsubstance which possesses them. He famously expresses his theory as\nfollows.\n\u2026when I enter most intimately into what I\ncall myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or\nother, of heat or cold, light or shade,love or hatred, pain or\npleasure. I can never catch myself at any time without a\nperception, and can never observe any thing but the\nperception.\n\n\nNevertheless, in the Appendix of the same work he expressed\ndissatisfaction with this account. Somewhat surprisingly, it is not\nvery clear just what his worry was, but it is expressed as follows:\nIn short there are two principles, which I cannot render\nconsistent; nor is it in my power to renounce either of them,\nviz. that all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences,\nand that the mind never perceives any real connection between\ndistinct existences.\n\n\nBerkeley had entertained a similar theory to the one found in Hume\u2019s\nmain text in his Philosophical Commentaries, (Notebook A, paras\n577\u201381), but later rejected it for the claim that we could have\na notion, though not an idea of the self. This\nBerkeleian view is expressed in more modern terms by John Foster.\nA natural response to Hume would be to say that, even if\nwe cannot detect ourselves apart from our perceptions (our conscious\nexperiences)we can at least detect ourselves in them \u2026 Surely I am\naware of [my experience], so to speak, from the inside \u2013 not as\nsomething presented, but as something which I have or as the\nexperiential state which I am in \u2026 and this is equivalent to saying\nthat I detect it by being aware of myself being visually aware. (1991:\n215)\n\n\nThere is a clash of intuitions here between which it is difficult to\narbitrate. There is an argument that is meant to favour the need for a\nsubject, as claimed by Berkeley and Foster.\n\nIf the bundle theory were true, then it should be possible to\nidentify mental events independently of, or prior to, identifying the\nperson or mind to which they belong.\nIt is not possible to identify mental events in this way.\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe bundle theory is false.\n\n\n\nE. J. Lowe (1996) defends this argument and argues for (2) as follows.\nWhat is wrong with the [bundle] theory is that \u2026 it\npresupposes, untenably,that an account of the identity conditions of\npsychological modes can be provided which need not rely on reference\nto persons. But it emerges that the identity of any psychological mode\nturns on the identity of the person that possesses it. What this\nimplies is that psychological modes are essentially modes of persons,\nand correspondingly that persons can be conceived of as\nsubstances.\n\n\nTo say that, according to the bundle theory, the identity conditions\nof individual mental states must be independent of the identity of the\nperson who possesses them, is to say that their identity is\nindependent of the bundle to which they belong. Hume certainly thought\nsomething like this, for he thought that an impression might \u2018float\nfree\u2019 from the mind to which it belonged, but it is not obvious that a\nbundle theorist is forced to adopt this position. Perhaps the identity\nof a mental event is bound up with the complex to which it\nbelongs. That this is impossible certainly needs further argument.\n\n\nHume seems, however, in the main text to unconsciously make a\nconcession to the opposing view, namely the view that there must be\nsomething more than the items in the bundle to make up a mind. He says:\nThe mind is a kind of theatre where several perceptions\nsuccessively make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away and\nmingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations.\n\n\nTalk of the mind as a theatre is, of course, normally associated with\nthe Cartesian picture, and the invocation of any necessary medium,\narena or even a field hypostasize some kind of entity which binds the\ndifferent contents together and without which they would not be a\nsingle mind. Modern Humeans \u2013 such as Parfit (1971; 1984) or Dainton\n(2008) \u2013 replace the theatre with a co-consciousness relation. So the\nbundle theorist is perhaps not as restricted as Hume thought. The\nbundle consists of the objects of awareness and the\nco-consciousness relation (or relations) that hold between them,\nand I think that the modern bundle theorist would want to say that it\nis the nexus of co-consciousness relations that constitutes our sense\nof the subject and of the act of awareness of the object. This\ninvolves abandoning the second of Hume\u2019s principles. that the mind\ncan never perceive any connection between distinct existences,\nbecause the co-consciousness relation is something of which we are\naware. The Humean point then becomes that we mistake the nexus of\nrelations for a kind of entity, in a way similar to that in which,\nHume claims,we mistake the regular succession of similar impressions\nfor an entity called an enduring physical object. Whether this really\nmakes sense in the end is another matter. I think that it is dubious\nwhether it can accommodate the subject as agent, but it does\nmean that simple introspection probably cannot refute a sophisticated\nbundle theory in the way that Lowe and Foster want. Hume\u2019s original\nposition seems to make him deny that we have any \u2018sense of self\u2019 at\nall, whilst the version that allows for our awareness of the\nrelatedness accommodates it, but explains how it can be an\nillusion. The rejection of bundle dualism, therefore, requires more\nthan an appeal to our intuitive awareness of ourselves as subjects.We\nwill see in the next section how arguments that defend the simplicity\nof the self attempt to undercut the bundle theory.\n4.5 Arguments from Personal Identity\n\n\nThere is a long tradition, dating at least from Reid (1785),\nfor arguing that the identity of persons over time is not a matter of\nconvention or degree in the way that the identity of other (complex)\nsubstances is and that this shows that the self is a different kind of\nentity from any physical body. Criticism of these arguments and of the\nintuitions on which they rest, running from Hume to Parfit (1970:\n1984), have left us with an inconclusive clash of intuitions. The\nargument under consideration and which, possibly, has its first\nstatement in Madell (1981), does not concern identity through time, but\nthe consequences for identity of certain counterfactuals concerning\norigin. It can, perhaps, therefore, break the stalemate which faces the\ndebate over diachronic identity. The claim is that the broadly\nconventionalist ways which are used to deal with problem cases through\ntime for both persons and material objects, and which can also be\nemployed in cases of counterfactuals concerning origin for bodies,\ncannot be used for similar counterfactuals concerning persons or\nminds.\n\n\nConcerning ordinary physical objects, it is easy to imagine\ncounterfactual cases where questions of identity become problematic.\nTake the example of a particular table. We can scale counterfactual\nsuggestions as follows:\n\nThis table might have been made of ice.\nThis table might have been made of a different sort of wood.\nThis table might have been made of 95% of the wood it was made of\nand 5% of some other wood.\n\n\n\nThe first suggestion would normally be rejected as clearly false,\nbut there will come a point along the spectrum illustrated by (i) and\n(iii) and towards (iii) where the question of whether the hypothesised\ntable would be the same as the one that actually exists have no obvious\nanswer. It seems that the question of whether it \u2018really\u2019\nis the same one has no clear meaning: it is of, say, 75% the same\nmatter and of 25% different matter; these are the only genuine facts in\nthe case; the question of numerical identity can be decided in any\nconvenient fashion, or left unresolved. There will thus be a penumbra\nof counterfactual cases where the question of whether two things would\nbe the same is not a matter of fact.\n\n\nLet us now apply this thought to conscious subjects. Suppose that a\ngiven human individual had had origins different from those which he in\nfact had such that whether that difference affected who he was\nwas not obvious to intuition. What would count as such a case might be\na matter of controversy, but there must be one. Perhaps it is unclear\nwhether, if there had been a counterpart to Jones\u2019 body from the same\negg but a different though genetically identical sperm from the same\nfather, the person there embodied would have been Jones. Some\nphilosophers might regard it as obvious that sameness of sperm is\nessential to the identity of a human body and to personal identity. In\nthat case imagine a counterpart sperm in which some of the molecules in\nthe sperm are different; would that be the same sperm? If one pursues\nthe matter far enough there will be indeterminacy which will infect\nthat of the resulting body. There must therefore be some difference\nsuch that neither natural language nor intuition tells us whether the\ndifference alters the identity of the human body; a point, that is,\nwhere the question of whether we have the same body is not a matter of\nfact.\n\n\nHow one is to describe these cases is, in some respects, a matter of\ncontroversy. Some philosophers think one can talk of vague\nidentity or partial identity. Others think that such\nexpressions are nonsensical. There is no space to discuss this issue\nhere. It is enough to assume, however, that questions of how one is\nallowed to use the concept of identity effect only the care with which\none should characterize these cases, not any substantive matter of\nfact. There are cases of substantial overlap of constitution in which\nthat fact is the only bedrock fact in the case: there is no\nfurther fact about whether they are \u2018really\u2019 the same\nobject. If there were, then there would have to be a\nhaecceitas or thisness belonging to and individuating\neach complex physical object, and this I am assuming to be implausible\nif not unintelligible. (More about the conditions under which\nhaecceitas can make sense will be found below.)\n\n\nOne might plausibly claim that no similar overlap of\nconstitution can be applied to the counterfactual identity of\nminds. In Geoffrey Madell\u2019s (1981) words:\nBut while my present body can thus have its partial\ncounterpart in some possible world, my present consciousness cannot.\nAny present state of consciousness that I can imagine either is or is\nnot mine. There is no question of degree here. (91)\n\n\nWhy is this so? Imagine the case where we are not sure whether it\nwould have been Jones\u2019 body \u2013 and, hence, Jones \u2013 that\nwould have been created by the slightly modified sperm and the same\negg. Can we say, as we would for an object with no consciousness, that\nthe story something the same, something different is the whole\nstory: that overlap of constitution is all there is to it? For the\nJones body as such, this approach would do as well as for any other\nphysical object. But suppose Jones, in reflective mood, asks himself\n\u2018if that had happened, would I have existed?\u2019 There are at\nleast three answers he might give to himself. (i) I either would or\nwould not, but I cannot tell. (ii) There is no fact of the matter\nwhether I would or would not have existed: it is just a mis-posed\nquestion. (iii) In some ways, or to some degree, I would have, and in\nsome ways, or to some degree, I would not. The creature who would have\nexisted would have had a kind of overlap of psychic constitution with\nme.\n\n\nThe third answer parallels the response we would give in the case of\nbodies. But as an account of the subjective situation, it is arguable\nthat this makes no sense. Call the creature that would have emerged\nfrom the slightly modified sperm, \u2018Jones2\u2019. Is the overlap\nsuggestion that, just as, say 85% of Jones2\u2019s original body would have\nbeen identical with Jones\u2019, about 85% of his psychic life would have\nbeen Jones\u2019? That it would have been like \nJones\u2019 \u2013 indeed that Jones2 might have had a psychic life 100% like \nJones\u2019 \u2013 makes perfect sense, but that he might have been to that\ndegree, the same psyche \u2013 that Jones \u201885% existed\u2019\n \u2013 arguably makes no sense. Take the case in which Jones and Jones2\nhave exactly similar lives throughout: which 85% of the 100%\nsimilar mental events do they share? Nor does it make sense to suggest\nthat Jones might have participated in the whole of Jones2\u2019s psychic\nlife, but in a rather ghostly only 85% there manner. Clearly,\nthe notion of overlap of numerically identical psychic parts cannot be\napplied in the way that overlap of actual bodily part constitution\nquite unproblematically can.\n\n\nThis might make one try the second answer. We can apply the\n\u2018overlap\u2019 answer to the Jones body, but the question of\nwhether the minds or subjects would have been the same, has no clear\nsense. It is difficult to see why it does not. Suppose Jones found out\nthat he had originally been one of twins, in the sense that the zygote\nfrom which he developed had divided, but that the other half had died\nsoon afterwards. He can entertain the thought that if it had been his\nhalf that had died, he would never have existed as a conscious being,\nthough someone would whose life, both inner and outer, might have been\nvery similar to his. He might feel rather guiltily grateful that it was\nthe other half that died. It would be strange to think that Jones is\nwrong to think that there is a matter of fact about this. And how is\none to \u2018manage\u2019 the transition from the case where there is\na matter of fact to the case where there is not?\n\n\nIf the reasoning above is correct, one is left with only the first\noption. If so, there has to be an absolute matter of fact from the\nsubjective point of view. But the physical examples we have considered\nshow that when something is essentially complex, this cannot be the\ncase. When there is constitution, degree and overlap of constitution\nare inevitably possible. So the mind must be simple, and this is\npossible only if it is something like a Cartesian substance.\n4.6 The Aristotelian Argument in a Modern Form\n\n\nPutting his anti-materialist argument outlined above, in section 1,\nin very general terms, Aristotle\u2019s worry was that a material organ\ncould not have the range and flexibility that are required for human\nthought. His worries concerned the cramping effect that matter would\nhave on the range of objects that intellect could accommodate.\nParallel modern concerns centre on the restriction that matter would\nimpose on the range of rational processes that we could\nexhibit. Some of these concerns are of a technical kind. G\u00f6del, for example, believed that his famous theorem showed that there are demonstrably rational forms of mathematical thought of which humans are capable which could not be exhibited by a mechanical\nor formal system of a sort that a physical mind would have to be. Penrose (1990) has argued that Turing\u2019s halting problem has similar consequences.But there are other less technical and easier to appreciate issues. I will mention four ways in which physicalist theories of thought seem vulnerable to attack by the dualist\n\n\n(a) At least since the time of Ryle\u2019s Concept of Mind (1949), it has been assumed that thinking can be handled in a dispositionalist way; so only sensations or \u2018raw feels\u2019 constitute a problem for the physicalist. There has been a rise or revival of a belief in what is now called cognitive phenomenology, that is, the belief that thoughts, of whatever kind \u2013 beliefs, desires, and the whole range of propositional attitude state \u2013 are conscious in a more than behavioural functional sense. This raises problems for physicalism, for, just as it is a problem that direct knowledge of \u2018what it is like\u2019 to experience your sensations is ultimately hidden from anyone else, so what you are thinking is directly accessible only privately, once it has been conceded that it has a phenomenology and not just a functional manifestation.\n\n\n(b) Anything purely physical operates solely according to physical laws operating on its physical properties: it does not, at bottom, operate according to meanings, senses, or propositional content. As a \u2018thinking machine\u2019, it is what Dennett (1987: 61) calls \u2018a syntactic engine\u2019, where \u2018syntax\u2019 is used, somewhat extendedly, to signify merely the physical structure of symbols and the consequent rules of their operation, rather than their meaning. The issue is whether, under this constraint, one can give an account for meaningful communication and understanding at all.\n\n\n(c) Physicalist theories of thought almost all focus on the model of\ncomputing, and when it comes to making problem solving (as opposed to\nsimply calculating) computers, computation comes across what is known\nas the Frame Problem. This is clearly expounded in Dennett\n(1984); see also the entry on\n the frame problem. \nThe problem is that the \u2018mechanical mind\u2019 can\nonly follow instructions, cannot see relevance that has not been\nstrictly encoded.This is often expressed by saying it lacks\n\u2018common sense\u2019.\n\n\n(d) There is what has become known as \u2018Benacerraf\u2019s Problem\u2019 (See his\n1983). Numbers, it would seem, are abstract objects, yet our\nintellects operate with them all the time. How does a physical brain\ninteract with an abstract entity? A similar problem could be raised\nfor concepts in general; they are abstract, general entities, not\nphysical particulars, yet they are the meat and drink of thinking. For\na dualist about intellect there does not appear to be the same\nproblem. The immaterial intellect is precisely the sort of thing that\ncan grasp abstract objects, such as numbers and universals \u2013 in the\nAristotelian context, the immaterial intellect is the home of\nforms. (There is still the issue of how this intellectual capacity of\nthe immaterial mind relates to sensory consciousness. According to\nAristotle, perception is a wholly embodied process, but for modern\ndualists, sensory consciousness is not material. In order to unify the\nperceptual and intellectual functions of the mind, traditional\nempiricists tended to be imagists, in their theory of thought, in\norder to assimilate the intellectual to the sensory, but this\nassimilation is rejected by those who believe in a distinct cognitive\nphenomenology, as mentioned in (a) above. The issue of how these two\nfunctions of mind are related in dualism is, it seems to me,\ninsufficiently investigated.)  The difficulty in accounting for the\nbrain\u2019s relation to abstract entities explains why most materialists\ntend to be nominalists,thus reducing thoughts to concrete particulars\nof some kind. (D. M. Armstrong in his (1978) is a striking exception\nto this, accepting an in re theory of universals.) But if you\ndo not find either nominalism or Armstrong\u2019s causal-functional theory\nof thinking convincing, Plato\u2019s idea in the Phaedo that the\nintellect must be such that it can have an affinity with immaterial\nthings begins to look very plausible.\n\n\n\nI will not discuss (a) further, as it is discussed in \nsection 5 of the \nentry on \n  phenomenal intentionality, \nAn immaterialist response to (d) can be found in Robinson (2011).\n\n\nBoth (b) and (c) seem to draw out the claim that a material system\n lacks understanding. John Searle\u2019s famous \u2018Chinese\n Room\u2019 argument (Searle 1980; see also the entry on\n  Chinese room argument) \nseems to support this conclusion, at least if the material system\ntakes the form of a classical computer, manipulating symbols according\nto rules. Searle imagines himself in a room with a letter box through\nwhich strings of symbols are posted in, and, following a book of\nrules, he puts out symbols which the rules dictate, given the strings\nhe is receiving. In fact, Searle says, he has been conducting a\nconversation in Chinese, because the symbols are Chinese script, and\nthe rules those on which a Chinese computer might work, but he has not\nunderstood a word. Therefore neither does a computer understand, so\nwe, understanding creatures, are not computers. If Searle is right,\nthis is the end for the classical \u2018syntactic engine\u2019 as a\nmodel for thought.\n\n\nA blow was struck against the computational theory of thought when, in\n2000, Fodor produced his The Mind Does Not Work That Way, in\nwhich he made clear his belief that the kind of computationalism that\nhe had been describing and developing ever since the 1970s only fits\nsub-personal informational processing, not conscious, problem solving\nthought. I say that he \u2018made this clear\u2019, because he had\nalways mentioned this reservation, but his claim that what he was\ndescribing was \u2018the Language of Thought\u2019 led his readers\ngenerally to take him to be proposing an account of what we normally\nconsider to be thinking, which is not restricted (even if it includes\nat all) sub-personal processes. The modest view it is entirely in line\nwith his close colleague Chomsky\u2019s claim that his\n\u2013 Chomsky\u2019s \u2013 linguistic theories cannot touch the \u2018creative\nuse of language\u2019(See Baker, 2011).\n\n\nOne physicalist response to these challenges is to say that they apply\nonly to the classical computing model, and are avoided by\nconnectionist theories. Classical computing works on rules of\ninference like those of standard logic, but connectionism is rather a\nform of associationism, which is supposedly closer to the way in which\nthe brain works.(See the entry on Connectionism.) The latest version\nof this \u2013 \u2018Deep Learning\u2019 \u2013 is very good at\nface recognition and, in general, pattern recognition, including those\ninvolved in the playing of games like chess and Go. But Gary Marcus\n(2018 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources) and others have pointed\nout the ways in which these impressive machines are quite different\nfrom human thought. Marcus points to ten significant differences, but\nthe two most easy to capture briefly are (i) \u2018deep\nlearning\u2019 is data hungry. We can learn things with very few\ntrials because we latch on to abstract relationships, whereas the\nmachine requires many \u2013 perhaps thousands or millions \u2013 of\nexamples to try to catch extensionally what we get by the abstract or\nintensional relation. (ii) Deep learning is shallow and has a limited\ncapacity for transfer of what it has learnt from one context to\nanother, even though the differences look trivial to us.  It seems\nthat collecting examples cannot itself constitute \u2018getting the\npoint\u2019, though it might manage to mimic it, if the circumstances\nare carefully managed.\n\n\nThe dualist might sum up the situation on thought in the following way. The case against physicalist theories of sensation is that it is unbelievable that what it feels like to be struck hard on the nose is itself either just a case of being disposed or caused to engage in certain behaviours, or that what it feels like is not fundamental to the way you do react. Similarly, the dualist about thought will say, when you are, for example, engaged in a philosophical discussion, and you make a response to your interlocutor, it is obvious that you are intending to respond to what you thought he or she meant and are concentrating on what what you intend to say means. It seems as bizarre to say that this is a bye-product of processes to which meaning is irrelevant, as it is to claim the same about sensory consciousness. You are, in other words, as fundamentally a semantically driven engine, as you are a sensorily consciously driven one. Perhaps, in the case of a sophisticated conversation, the fundamentality of meaning, and of conscious reflection, as a driver is even more obvious than in the case of sensation\n\n\nA dualist could, it seems, argue that Plato was right in claiming that intellect necessarily has an affinity with the realm of abstract entities, and Aristotle was right to think that no material or mechanical system could capture the flexibility built into genuine understanding. We all have our limitations, but there is no specific point, following directly from what we are made of, or how we are \u2018programmed\u2019 which constitutes an absolute barrier.\n5. Problems for Dualism\n\n\nWe have already discussed the problem of interaction. In this\nsection we shall consider two other facets of dualism that worry\ncritics. First, there is what one might term the queerness of\nthe mental if conceived of as non-physical. Second there is the\ndifficulty of giving an account of the unity of the mind. We shall\nconsider this latter as it faces both the bundle theorist and the\nsubstance dualist.\n5.1 The Queerness of the Mental\n\n\nMental states are characterised by two main properties,\nsubjectivity, otherwise known as privileged access, and intentionality.\nPhysical objects and their properties are sometimes observable and\nsometimes not, but any physical object is equally accessible, in\nprinciple, to anyone. From the right location, we could all see the\ntree in the quad, and, though none of us can observe an electron\ndirectly, everyone is equally capable of detecting it in the same ways\nusing instruments. But the possessor of mental states has a privileged\naccess to them that no-one else can share. That is why there is a\nsceptical \u2018problem of other minds\u2019, but no corresponding\n\u2018problem of my own mind\u2019. This suggests to some\nphilosophers that minds are not ordinary occupants of physical\nspace.\n\n\nPhysical objects are spatio-temporal, and bear spatio-temporal and\ncausal relations to each other. Mental states seem to have causal\npowers, but they also possess the mysterious property of \nintentionality \u2013 being about other things \u2013 including things \nlike Zeus and the square root of minus one, which do not exist. No mere\nphysical thing could be said to be, in a literal sense,\n\u2018about\u2019 something else. The nature of the mental is both\nqueer and elusive. In Ryle\u2019s deliberately abusive phrase, the mind, as\nthe dualist conceives of it, is a \u2018ghost in a machine\u2019.\nGhosts are mysterious and unintelligible: machines are composed of\nidentifiable parts and work on intelligible principles. But this\ncontrast holds only if we stick to a Newtonian and common-sense view of\nthe material. Think instead of energy and force-fields in a space-time\nthat possesses none of the properties that our senses seem to reveal:\non this conception, we seem to be able to attribute to matter nothing\nbeyond an abstruse mathematical structure. Whilst the material world,\nbecause of its mathematicalisation, forms a tighter abstract system\nthan mind, the sensible properties that figure as the objects of mental\nstates constitute the only intelligible content for any concrete\npicture of the world that we can devise. Perhaps the world within the\nexperiencing mind is, once one considers it properly, no \nmore \u2013 or even less \u2013 queer than the world outside it.\n5.2 The Unity of the Mind\n\n\nWhether one believes that the mind is a substance or just a bundle\nof properties, the same challenge arises, which is to explain the\nnature of the unity of the immaterial mind. For the Cartesian, that\nmeans explaining how he understands the notion of immaterial substance.\nFor the Humean, the issue is to explain the nature of the relationship\nbetween the different elements in the bundle that binds them into one\nthing. Neither tradition has been notably successful in this latter\ntask: indeed, Hume, in the appendix to the Treatise, declared\nhimself wholly mystified by the problem, rejecting his own initial\nsolution (though quite why is not clear from the text).\n5.2.1 Unity and Bundle Dualism\n\n\nIf the mind is only a bundle of properties, without a mental\nsubstance to unite them, then an account is needed of what constitutes\nits unity. The only route appears to be to postulate a primitive\nrelation of co-consciousness in which the various elements stand to\neach other.\n\n\nThere are two strategies which can be used to attack the bundle\ntheory. One is to claim that our intuitions favour belief in a subject\nand that the arguments presented in favour of the bundle alternative\nare unsuccessful, so the intuition stands. The other is to try to\nrefute the theory itself. Foster (1991, 212\u20139) takes the former path.\nThis is not effective against someone who thinks that metaphysical\neconomy gives a prima facie priority to bundle theories, on account of\ntheir avoiding mysterious substances.\n\n\nThe core objection to bundle theories (see, for example, Armstrong\n(1968), 21\u20133) is that, because it takes individual mental contents as\nits elements, such contents should be able to exist alone, as could the\nindividual bricks from a house. Hume accepted this consequence, but\nmost philosophers regard it as absurd. There could not be a mind that\nconsisted of a lone pain or red after-image, especially not of one that\nhad detached itself from the mind to which it had previously belonged.\nTherefore it makes more sense to think of mental contents as modes\nof a subject.\n\n\nBundle theorists tend to take phenomenal contents as the primary\nelements in their bundle. Thus the problem is how to relate, say, the\nvisual field to the auditory field, producing a \u2018unity of\napperception\u2019, that is, a total experience that seems to be\npresented to a single subject. Seeing the problem in this way has\nobvious Humean roots. This atomistic conception of the problem becomes\nless natural if one tries to accommodate other kinds of mental activity\nand contents. How are acts of conceptualising, attending to or willing\nwith respect to, such perceptual contents to be conceived? These kinds\nof mental acts seem to be less naturally treated as atomic elements in\na bundle, bound by a passive unity of apperception. William James\n(1890, vol. 1, 336\u201341) attempts to answer these problems. He claims to\nintrospect in himself a \u2018pulse of thought\u2019 for each present\nmoment, which he calls \u2018the Thought\u2019 and which is the\n\u2018vehicle of the judgement of identity\u2019 and the\n\u2018vehicle of choice as well as of cognition\u2019. These\n\u2018pulses\u2019 are united over time because each\n\u2018appropriates\u2019 the past Thoughts and \u2018makes us say\n\u201cas sure as I exist, those past facts were part of myself\u201d.\nJames attributes to these Thoughts acts of judging, attending, willing\netc, and this may seem incoherent in the absence of a genuine subject.\nBut there is also a tendency to treat many if not all aspects of agency\nas mere awareness of bodily actions or tendencies, which moves one back\ntowards a more normal Humean position. Whether James\u2019 position really\nimproves on Hume\u2019s, or merely mystifies it, is still a moot point. (But\nsee Sprigge (1993), 84\u201397, for an excellent, sympathetic\ndiscussion.)\n5.2.2 Unity and Substance Dualism\n\n\nThe problem is to explain what kind of a thing an immaterial\nsubstance is, such that its presence explains the unity of the mind.\nThe answers given can be divided into three kinds.\n\n\n(a) The \u2018ectoplasm\u2019 account: The view that immaterial\nsubstance is a kind of immaterial stuff. There are two problems with\nthis approach. First, in so far as this \u2018ectoplasm\u2019 has any\ncharacterisation as a \u2018stuff\u2019 \u2013 that is, a structure\nof its own over and above the explicitly mental properties that it\nsustains \u2013 it leaves it as much a mystery why this kind\nof stuff should support consciousness as it is why ordinary matter\nshould. Second, and connectedly, it is not clear in what sense such\nstuff is immaterial, except in the sense that it cannot be integrated\ninto the normal scientific account of the physical world. Why is it not\njust an aberrant kind of physical stuff?\n\n\n(b) The \u2018consciousness\u2019 account: The view that consciousness is the\nsubstance. Account (a) allowed the immaterial substance to have a\nnature over and above the kinds of state we would regard as mental. The\nconsciousness account does not. This is Descartes\u2019 view. The most\nobvious objection to this theory is that it does not allow the subject\nto exist when unconscious. This forces one to take one of four possible\ntheories. One could claim (i) that we are conscious when we do not seem\nto be (which was Descartes\u2019 view): or (ii) that we exist\nintermittently, though are still the same thing (which is Swinburne\u2019s\ntheory, (1997), 179): or (iii) that each of us consists of a series of\nsubstances, changed at any break in consciousness, which pushes one\ntowards a constructivist account of identity through time and so\ntowards the spirit of the bundle theory: or (iv) even more\nspeculatively, that the self stands in such a relation to the normal\ntime series that its own continued existence is not brought into\nquestion by its failure to be present in time at those moments when it\nis not conscious within that series (Robinson, forthcoming).\n\n\n(c) The \u2018no-analysis\u2019 account: The view that it is a mistake to\npresent any analysis. This is Foster\u2019s view, though I think Vendler\n(1984) and Madell (1981) have similar positions. Foster argues that\neven the \u2018consciousness\u2019 account is an attempt to explain\nwhat the immaterial self is \u2018made of\u2019 which assimilates it\ntoo far towards a kind of physical substance. In other words, Descartes\nhas only half escaped from the \u2018ectoplasmic\u2019 model. (He\nhas half escaped because he does not attribute non-mental\nproperties to the self, but he is still captured by trying to explain\nwhat it is made of.)\n\n\nFoster (1991) expresses it as follows:\n\u2026it seems to me that when I focus on myself\nintrospectively, I am not only aware of being in a certain mental\ncondition; I am also aware, with the same kind of immediacy, of being a\ncertain sort of thing\u2026 \n\n\n\nIt will now be asked: \u2018Well, what is this nature,\nthis sortal attribute? Let\u2019s have it specified!\u2019 But such a\ndemand is misconceived. Of course, I can give it a verbal label: for\ninstance, I can call it \u2018subjectness\u2019 or\n\u2018selfhood\u2019. But unless they are interpreted\n\u2018ostensively\u2019, by reference to what is revealed by\nintrospective awareness, such labels will not convey anything over and\nabove the nominal essence of the term \u2018basic subject\u2019. In\nthis respect, however, there is no difference between this attribute,\nwhich constitutes the subject\u2019s essential nature, and the specific\npsychological attributes of his conscious life\u2026\n\n\nAdmittedly, the feeling that there must be more to be said from a\nGod\u2019s eye view dies hard. The reason is that, even when we have\nacknowledged that basic subjects are wholly non-physical, we still tend\nto approach the issue of their essential natures in the shadow of the\nphysical paradigm. (243\u20135)\n\n\n\nBerkeley\u2019s concept of notion again helps here. One can\ninterpret Berkeley as implying that there is more to the self than\nintrospection can capture, or we can interpret him as saying that\nnotions, though presenting stranger entities than ideas,\ncapture them just as totally. The latter is the \u2018no account is\nneeded\u2019 view.",
