    "main_text": "Theory of Democracy and Constitutional Theory\n5. Liberal Cosmopolitanism and the Foundations of International Order\n Schmitt\u2019s conception of the political grounds a distinctive\ninterpretation of democracy and constitutionalism in the domestic\nsphere. It led Schmitt to an equally distinctive account of the\nfoundations of international legality that has received increasing\nscholarly attention in recent years (Scheuerman 1999, 141\u201373;\nScheuerman 2006; Odysseos and Petito 2007; Axtmann 2007; Hooker 2009;\nSlomp 2009; Legg 2011; Benhabib 2012; Neumann 2015, 419\u2013492; Koskenniemi 2016; Hathaway and Shapiro 2017; Kalyvas 2018). Schmitt is a staunch defender\nof sovereignty, but he does not embrace a flat rejection of\ninternational legality. Rather, Schmitt appears concerned to outline\nthe conditions under which sovereign political communities, with\ndiffering political identities, can co-exist in a shared international\nlegal order.\n\n\nTwo important consequences for international theory of Schmitt\u2019s\nconception of politics are immediately obvious. First, it implies that\nevery true political community must claim a legally unrestricted ius\nad bellum. If the distinction between friend and enemy that\nconstitutes a group\u2019s political existence is not drawn by the group\nitself but by someone else, or if the decision whether to go to war in\na concrete situation is no longer taken by the group but by some third\nparty \u2014 be it a hegemonic state, an international organization,\nor an international court \u2014 the group no longer exists as an\nindependent political community (CP 45\u201353). The second key\nconsequence of Schmitt\u2019s conception of politics for international\ntheory follows from the claim that the political existence of a group\nmust be based on a particular identity that serves as the substance of\na friend-enemy distinction. Such an identity, of course, must differ\nfrom the identity of any other political community for the group in\nquestion to achieve a political identity of its own. It would be\nimpossible for there to be a plurality of political communities\n\u2014 and hence, since political community is only possible where a\ngroup has enemies, for there to be any political community \u2014 if\nthere were only one legitimate form of social organization or communal\nlife (CP 53\u20138). These two consequences of Schmitt\u2019s conception\nof politics imply two conditions of the legitimacy of international\norder, at least if one makes the assumption, with Schmitt, that\npolitical communities have an unconditional right to preserve their\nexistence (CP 48\u20139; CT 75\u20137).  Given this assumption, a\nlegitimate international order must be able to accommodate a plurality\nof political communities with different, self-determined political\nidentities. What is more, it must recognize as legitimate the ius ad\nbellum claimed by all groups that have successfully constituted\nthemselves as political communities. A conception of international\norder that violates any of these two conditions would be incompatible\nwith political existence and therefore illegitimate.\n\n\nThese demands on legitimate international order seem to be a recipe\nfor anarchy. Would it not have been better for Schmitt to admit that\nhis view implies a denial of international legal order? Schmitt\u2019s reply\nto this objection is twofold. On the one hand, he argues that there is\nat least one historical instance of a functioning international order\nthat lived up to his criteria of legitimacy. On the other hand, Schmitt\nclaims that the attempt to subject the use of force on the part of\npolitical communities to external legal constraint and control, apart\nfrom constituting an assault on the possibility of political existence,\nwill only lead to greater disorder and violence than we can expect to\nexperience in a system that recognizes the political.\n\n\nSchmitt\u2019s first reply is based on an interpretation of the nature of\nEuropean political order in the period from the establishment of the\nmodern sovereign state to the beginning of WWI. In Schmitt\u2019s account,\nthis period was not a period of mere anarchy. Rather, it was\ncharacterized by the existence of a public law governing the relations\nbetween European states, the ius publicum Europaeum (NE 140\u2013212). The\nmain pillar of the ius publicum Europaeum, according to Schmitt, was a\nstrict separation between the ius ad bellum and the ius in bello. On\nthe level of ius ad bellum, all independent states were recognized to\npossess the right to go to war on the basis of their own judgment of\njustice and necessity. The legal order of ius publicum Europaeum, in\neffect, did not distinguish between just and unjust war. Rather, both\nsides in a conflict between sovereign states were by default recognized\nas legitimate belligerents (NE 140\u201371). Moreover, since both states in\nany conflict were held to be legitimate belligerents, states not\ndirectly involved in a conflict were taken to possess the right to\nchoose to back either side or to remain neutral (DCW 53\u201374). This\nframework, Schmitt argues, allowed European states to bring about a\nhighly effective containment of the negative consequences of war, and\nthus of the dangers of political existence. The abstraction from the\njustice of war allowed states to make peace without being hampered by\nthe need to apportion moral blame. The freedom to side with either\nparty in a conflict, or else to remain neutral, allowed states to\ncontain conflicts by balancing or simply by staying out of the fight.\nMost importantly, however, the mutual recognition of legitimate\nbelligerency allowed for the effective enforcement of stringent\nconstraints on the permissible means of warfare on the level of ius in\nbello. Inter-statal warfare during the period of the jus publicum\nEuropaeum, according to Schmitt, distinguished carefully between\ncombatants and civilians and abstained from using methods of warfare\nthat might endanger the lives or the property of civilians (NE 142\u201343,\n165\u20138).\n\n\nThis containment of war, Schmitt claims, was premised on the\nwillingness to bracket the question of justice on the level of ius ad\nbellum. Once one takes the view that a war can be legitimate on one\nside, while being illegitimate on the other, one is forced to\nconclude, Schmitt argues, that it is morally wrong to grant the status\nof legitimate belligerency to those who are judged to fight without a\njust cause, and equally wrong to assume that they ought to enjoy the\nsame in bello-rights as those who fight justly (NE 320\u20132; CP\n54\u20137). Moreover, once one separates between legitimate and\nillegitimate belligerency, it will no longer be possible to argue that\nother states have the right to side with either belligerent or to\nremain neutral. Rather, third parties will be seen to have a duty to\nside with those who fight justly (DK 26\u201353). The abandonment of\nthe idea that all participants in a war among states are equally\nlegitimate belligerents, Schmitt concludes, inevitably undercuts the\ncontainment of war achieved in ius publicum Europaeum (PB\n286\u201390). Unsurprisingly, Schmitt rejected the project of\ncreating an international legal order based on a \u2018discriminating\nconcept of war\u2019 that would subject the use of force on the part\nof sovereign states to substantive criteria of moral legitimacy and\nexternal legal control. He regarded such developments as little more\nthan attempts on the part of the victorious western allies to brand\nany violent German effort to revise the outcomes of WWI as illegal and\nthus as unjust, and to give themselves license for the application of\nmeans of coercion and for the use of methods of warfare that would\nhave been considered as illegitimate in the context of mutually\nlegitimate belligerency (PB 184\u2013203; NE 259\u201380). Schmitt\nargued that international legalization on the model of just war theory\nwould not prevent coming wars. It would merely make them more total,\nas it would encourage opponents to regard each other as absolute\nenemies worthy of elimination (NE 309\u201322; Brown 2007; Slomp\n2009, 95\u2013111).\n\n\nHowever, Schmitt acknowledged that the era of ius publicum Europaeum\nhad come to an end after WWI, together with the global hegemony of the\nclassical European concert of sovereign states (GO\n101\u201311). Schmitt therefore aimed to assess the chances for the\nemergence of a new global order analogous in structure to ius publicum\nEuropaeum and he made an attempt, in The Nomos of the Earth,\nto explicate the presuppositions of the kind of international order\nexemplified by ius publicum Europaeum.  For it to be possible for\ngroups that are related by enmity nevertheless to co-exist in a shared\nframework which limits the consequences of war mutual enmity must be\nprevented from reaching the level of absolute enmity. Enmity, even\nwhile it may require one to defend one\u2019s own political existence\nagainst the enemy, must not require the complete destruction of the\nenemy\u2019s political and perhaps of his physical existence. Ius publicum\nEuropaeum, in Schmitt\u2019s view, had been capable of preventing absolute\nenmity through an alignment of friend-enemy distinctions with\nterritorial boundaries (Zarmanian 2006).  If the forms of life of two\nopposed political communities are each tied to and expressed in a\nparticular territory, then the two groups will be able, Schmitt\nargues, to spatialize the friend-enemy distinction between them (NE\n42\u20139). From the point of view of any one of the two groups, the\nprotection of its political existence will require it to repel any\nattempt on the part of the other group to dispossess it of its\nterritory. But it will not require the one group to interfere with or\nto destroy the political existence of the other group if to do so is\nunnecessary for the protection of its own territory. All political\nconflicts, under such circumstances, can be reduced to territorial\nconflicts, and this entails that all conflicts can in principle be\ncontained as long as it is possible to divide territory in a way that\nwill allow both groups to maintain their form of life (NE\n143\u20138).\n\n\nFor political conflicts to be reducible to territorial conflicts,\nopposing political communities must of course accept the principle of\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of other political\ncommunities. The reduction of political conflict to territorial\nconflict would be impossible if political allegiances were spread out\nacross borders. If some of those who share the identity that we have\nmade into the basis of our political life live in a territory\ncontrolled by another political community we will have to concern\nourselves with their fate. If we perceive them to be oppressed by that\nother community, we may feel compelled to go to war for them, even if\nthe other community has not aggressed against our own territory. To\nterritorialize the friend-enemy distinction, hence, one must ensure\nthat all and only the people who share the same political identity live\nin the same territory (GO 86\u20138, 96\u2013101). Some political identities,\nhowever, do not lend themselves to a spatialization of the political. A\ncommunity whose political identity is premised on the promotion of\nliberal-humanitarian values which it takes to be universal, for\ninstance, must concern itself with the question whether other political\ncommunities respect those values and be willing to interfere if they\ndon\u2019t. It cannot accept a reduction of political conflict to\nterritorial conflict, as its political identity purports to be\nnon-exclusive. A global order on the model of ius publicum Europaeum\nwill therefore remain unattainable, and a global civil war\ncharacterized by absolute enmity will be unavoidable, Schmitt\nconcludes, as long as the world\u2019s foremost powers are committed to\nuniversalist ideologies that imply a rejection of the spatialization of\npolitical conflict (GO 90\u20135; VA 375\u201385).\n\n\nAs Schmitt would later point out in Theory of the Partisan,\nthe distinction between absolute and contained enmity gives rise to a\ndistinction between absolute, real, and conventional enemies (TP\n85\u201395; see also CP 36\u20137; Slomp 2009, 112\u201326). A\nconventional enemy is an enemy within an established system of\ncontainment, whereas a real enemy is an enemy that can be made, though\nperhaps only after conflict, to settle for a territorial\ndivision. Absolute enmity, by contrast, exists wherever there is a\nconflict that is not amenable to territorial settlement. In Schmitt\u2019s\nview, it is the powers who, for ideological reasons, refuse to accept\na spatialization of conflict that are to blame for absolute enmity and\nthe unbridled violence it entails. Those who are real enemies, but who\nneed not be each other\u2019s absolute enemies, then, have to find a way to\nrecognize each other, to divide the world among themselves, and to\nhold down political forces that must reject the territorialization of\npolitical conflict. Schmitt\u2019s The Nomos of the Earth,\naccordingly, portrayed the mutually recognized appropriation of the\nglobe by mutually non-intervening, territorially-based political\ncommunities as the true foundation of all legitimate international (and thus of national)\nlegal order (NE 42\u20139, 67\u201383; GO 77\u20139; see also Herrero 2015, 21\u201349). During the\nNazi-period, Schmitt applied this view to a justification of\nNazi-aggression, by portraying Nazi-Germany as a local hegemon willing\nto support a global territorial division based on a principle of\nnon-intervention. Schmitt hoped, for a while at least, that America\nwould reveal itself to be Germany\u2019s \u2018real enemy\u2019 and that\nit would be willing to engage in a mutual division of spheres of\ninfluence. In this vein, Schmitt interpreted the Monroe-doctrine as\nthe first act of hegemonic appropriation of a sphere of interest that\nmight come to form part of a new global order, if only America were\nwilling let Germany impose its own Monroe-doctrine on continental\nEurope (GO 83\u201390). For as long as they were militarily successful,\nSchmitt celebrated the Nazi wars as the birth pangs of a new\n\u2018nomos of the earth.\u2019 (LS section 20)\n\n\nOf course, Schmitt\u2019s hopes were disappointed when the war, after\ncatastrophic bloodshed, ended in a stalemate between two hegemonic\npowers that were both unwilling to repudiate universalist ideology,\nbut nevertheless quite successful in preventing their own conflict\nfrom escalating into open war. Schmitt, though, did not question his\nclaim that international order ought to be based on territorial\ndivision. It became fashionable in circles around Schmitt to refer to\nthe cold war as a \u2018global civil war\u2019 (M\u00fcller 2003,\n104\u201315) while Schmitt, in Theory of the Partisan,\nexpressed his admiration of Mao\u2019s and Ho Chi-minh\u2019s partisans for\nexhibiting a \u201ctelluric\u201d character and a \u201ctie to the\nsoil\u201d while rejecting \u201cworld revolutionary or technicistic\nideology.\u201d (TP 20\u20132) The new order was still supposed to\nemerge from a distribution of the globe among internally homogenous\npeoples tied to a certain land.\n\n\nIt should be obvious that Schmitt\u2019s theory of the presuppositions of\ninternational order is closely related to his account of the conditions\nof well-functioning domestic legality (Vinx 2013b). The spatialization of conflict\nrequires political communities strong enough to enforce internal\npolitical homogeneity. But political communities are unlikely to be\nable to enforce internal homogeneity if they have to live in an\ninternational environment that lacks a clear spatial order because it\nis controlled by powers that are ideologically hostile to the\nspatialization of conflict. Legitimate domestic order and legitimate\ninternational order, for Schmitt, are thus two sides of the same coin.\nBoth require a defense of the political, as Schmitt understands it.\n(Axtmann 2007) Schmitt\u2019s suggestion, however, that the preservation of\nthe political as he understands it is a necessary condition of\nlegitimate domestic and international legality seems rather hard to\nswallow in light of the catastrophic experiences of the 20th century.\nSchmitt was an acute observer and analyst of the weaknesses of liberal\nconstitutionalism and liberal cosmopolitanism. But there can be little\ndoubt that his preferred cure turned out to be infinitely worse than\nthe disease.\n",
