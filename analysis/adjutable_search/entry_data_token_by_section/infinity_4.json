    "main_text": "Infinity in mathematics: a brief historical overview || The calculus\n2.3 The calculus\n\nThe most fruitful development in the use of infinity in 17th century\nmathematics was that of the calculus.\n\nFrom a geometrical point of view, the calculus provides techniques for\ndrawing tangents at an arbitrary point of a curve and for measuring\nthe area under a portion of a curve. The differential calculus treats\nthe first problem and the integral calculus the second. The\nfundamental theorem of the calculus states that these problems are\ninverses of each other. The calculus was developed independently by\nNewton and Leibniz, but its spread owed much to a significant number\nof mathematicians throughout Europe. The first textbook of the\ndifferential calculus was published in 1696 by the Marquis de\nl\u2019H\u00f4pital (1696; see Bradley et al. 2015 for a\ntranslation, which we follow below, with commentary). It is worthwhile\nto consider its axiomatized structure, for it will help us see\nimmediately the infinitary foundations on which the new discipline\npresented itself to the international community. We first have two\ndefinitions:\n\nDefinition I. Those quantities are called variable\nwhich increase or decrease continually, as opposed to constant\nquantities that remain the same while others change.\n\nDefinition II. The infinitely small portion by which\na variable quantity continually increases or decreases is called the\nDifferential.\n\nThe two postulates are as follows.\n\nPostulate I. We suppose that two quantities that\ndiffer by an infinitely small quantity may be used interchangeably, or\n(what amounts to the same thing) that a quantity which is increased or\ndecreased by another quantity that is infinitely smaller than it is,\nmay be considered as remaining the same.\n\nPostulate II. We suppose that a curved line may be\nconsidered as an assemblage of infinitely many straight lines, each\none being infinitely small, or (what amounts to the same thing) as a\npolygon with an infinite number of sides, each being infinitely small,\nwhich determine the curvature of the line by the angles formed amongst\nthemselves.\n\nWe see in the above the explicit infinitary characterization of some\nof the basic entities appealed to in the new calculus. Both postulates\nrequire something that the Greeks had studiously avoided, namely the\nconsideration of infinitely small quantities and the reduction of\ncurves to infinilateral polygons. While l\u2019H\u00f4pital and a\nnumber of French mathematicians were enthusiastic about going\n\u201cinfinitary\u201d, Leibniz himself developed a fictionalist\naccount of the appeal to infinitely small quantities (foreshadowed\nalready in his early De Quadratura which did not see the\nlight of day until 1993; see Leibniz (1993)). Also note the use of\ngeometrical and kinematic (i.e. based on movement, as implied by the\nnotions of continual increase or decrease) concepts. Much of the 19th\ncentury work on the calculus was devoted to removing geometrical and\nkinematic notions from the foundations of the discipline.\n\nThe literature in this area is enormous and we refer to Goldenbaum and\nJesseph (2008) for a recent collection of essays on Leibnizian\ninfinitesimals. The debates on the foundations of the calculus led to\nsome lively contributions, such as Berkeley\u2019s The\nAnalyst (1734) and more mathematical work. But even after\ninfinitesimals were eliminated from the calculus through the combined\nwork of Cauchy, Bolzano, Dedekind, and Weierstrass in the 19th\ncentury, they were widely employed in geometry. Moreover, contemporary\nalternative theories of analysis (non-standard analysis, infinitesimal\nanalysis etc.) have led to rigorous theories that, taken with a grain\nof salt, can be seen as vindicating some of the 17th century\nintuitions. We will come back to these developments below.\n",
