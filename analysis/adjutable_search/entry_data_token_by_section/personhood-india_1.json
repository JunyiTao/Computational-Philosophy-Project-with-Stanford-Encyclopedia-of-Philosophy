    "main_text": "Classical Indian Conceptions of Persons || Spiritual Conceptions of Persons\n1.2 Spiritual Conceptions of Persons\n\nThe Ved\u0101nta and S\u0101\u1e43khya-Yoga is the most important\nschool that develop the spiritual and mystical insights in the\nUpani\u1e63ads. The Advaita Ved\u0101nta is well-known for upholding\nmonism, there is only one reality and that is Brahman. Furthermore,\nthe Advaita Ved\u0101nta philosophers argue that the individual self\nand the supreme Self (Brahman) are identical. The plurality\nof the external world of everyday experience is explained away as an\nillusory projection (m\u0101y\u0101), a cosmic illusion which\nis a product of our ignorance. The nature of this self is simply pure\nconsciousness. Self, according to the Advaita Ved\u0101nta is not to\nbe understood as a substance that has the property of consciousness\nbut rather it is consciousness itself, the principle of illumination\nor manifestation (praka\u0304s\u0301a). This consciousness\nmanifests all things. Just as without the sunlight, the universe would\nbe shrouded in darkness, similarly without consciousness nothing would\nbe known or manifested\u2019 (Gupta 2003: 31\u20132; cf. 106).\nAccording to the Advaitins,\n\nconsciousness has no form, no content; its only function, like that of\nlight, is to show the object on which it is focused\u2026. The\nAdvaitins argue that, that which manifests everything cannot have the\nform of any particular thing; manifestation is its only function.\n(Gupta 2003: 119\u201320)\n\n\nThe Advaita Veda\u0304nta thesis is that this consciousness is what a\nperson is at the most fundamental level, the self\n(a\u0304tman). But as far as my sense of myself as a person\nis concerned, I take myself to be a psychophysical thing among others,\nhaving certain properties and relations, such as belonging to a\ncertain family (caste, according to the Hindus) and having a certain\nsocial role. The Advaita Veda\u0304nta philosophers argue that this\nsense of self is a result of a false identification with aspects of\nthe projected world. Person (an empirical self in their terminology)\nin their sense has no ultimate reality, it is merely another\nprojection of the cosmic illusion. Though the person is ordinarily\nexperienced as a particular entity in the world and standing in\nmanifold relations to other entities, it is dismissed as a product of\nignorance. Their concern is with the \u2018self/supreme Self\u2019\nidentity and with self-knowledge as the most promising route to\nliberation (mok\u1e63a). Once we understand the true nature\nof ourselves, primarily through the study of the Upani\u1e63ads\ncomplemented by the practice of meditation, we will grasp that essence\nof an individual (a\u0304tman) is identical with the real\nSelf (Brahman). The person or empirical self will fall away\nas merely an illusory projection of consciousness.\n\nThe S\u0101\u1e43khya and Yoga schools draw inspiration for their\nmetaphysics of persons from the Upani\u1e63ads and develop the\ninsight that the real essence of a person is the soul or in\nS\u0101\u1e43khya terminology, the Spirit (puru\u1e63a).\nBut unlike the Veda\u0304nta, the S\u0101\u1e43khya and Yoga\nphilosophers do not regard the multiplicity of true persons as a mere\nillusion. They speak of the absolute puru\u1e63a\n(\u012b\u015bvara) and individual puru\u1e63as\n(j\u012bvas). Verse 18 of the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya-k\u0101rik\u0101 offers a proof and\nexplanation for the existence of multiplicity of real persons\n\nThe incidence of birth and death and the action of the sense faculties\ndifferent for different individuals; all people not having the same\ninclinations at the same time; the thoughts arising out of the action\nof the three gu\u1e47as being different for different people \u2013\nit follows that souls (puru\u1e63as) are many (each person\nhaving a separate soul). (Translation adapted from Radhanath Phukan\n1960).\n\n\nEvery individual person (j\u012bva) is a manifestation or\ninstantiation of the absolute puru\u1e63a, which is present\nas an undivided whole in every person. The puru\u1e63a is\nthus the universal aspect in virtue of which we are persons. But each\nindividual person is also a finite particular. The particular aspect\nof an individual person is derived from the material form or nature\n(prak\u1e5bti ) which supplies the physical body and its\nadjuncts (sense organs, etc.). Nature (prak\u1e5bti) works\nthrough three gu\u1e47as which are its functional forces,\nknown as existence or beingness (sattva), force of bringing\nabout change (rajas), and force for restrains change\n(tamas). Sattva exhibits the physical characteristic\nof buoyancy and illumination, and the psychological characteristic of\npleasure. Rajas exhibits the physical characteristic of\nstimulation and movement and the psychological characteristics of pain\nand passion. Tamas exhibits the physical characteristic of\nweight and resistance and the characteristics of dejection and\ndespondency. The disturbance in the equipoise of the three\ngu\u1e47as starts the process of evolution which is the\nprocess of creation. As explained in the quote above, each individual\nperson is a unique composition of gu\u1e47as that determine\nher physical and psychological characteristics, for example those with\na predominance of tamas will be naturally disposed to resist\nchange and activity.\n\nAccording to S\u0101\u1e43khya philosophers, the relation between\nprak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a in an individual\nperson is said to be eternal and irresolvable. This raises a problem\nfor the S\u0101\u1e43khya, namely, how are we to explain the bondage\n(coming together) of prak\u1e5bti and puru\u1e63a\n(soul), and how is the final release liberation of\npuru\u1e63a possible? The clue lies in understanding the\nprocess of evolution. Verse 21 of the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya-k\u0101rik\u0101 offers a succinct\nanswer:\n\nFor the sake of puru\u1e63a\u2019s perception of\nprak\u1e5bti and for the sake of his release, a union of the\ntwo takes place, which resembles the union of the lame and the blind\n(translation adapted from Majumdar 1930, 77).\n\n\nThe author of the K\u0101rik\u0101 makes use of an analogy\noften exploited in classical Indian philosophy, of the union of the\nlame and the blind who happen to encounter each other and decide to\ncooperate for their mutual benefit which is to reach their desired\ndestination (metaphorically liberation). The lame man (soul) mounts\nthe shoulders of the blind man (matter) and directs both to the\ndesired destination. And, just as the blind man and the lame man part\ncompany when they reach their mutual destination, so do soul and\nmatter. Creation of an individual person results from the desire to\nperceive and experience prak\u1e5bti and her manifestations\nin the form of sensual pleasures derived from material objects.\nCreation is more properly understood as evolution of\nprak\u1e5bti to reveal her many forms to the soul for the\nsake of his enjoyment, even though the union of prak\u1e5bti\nand puru\u1e63a is eternal. Bondage results in the soul\nbeing tricked by the various forms of prak\u1e5bti\nespecially the ego-sense (aha\u1e43k\u0101ra) and the\nphysical body to the extent of identifying with these material forms\nas part of the soul. This identification results in the soul\nforgetting its true nature and being totally spell-bound by\nprak\u1e5bti and the many pleasures afforded by material\nforms. This forgetfulness results in alienation of the soul which\ncauses in unhappiness and misery. Most of us, ordinary persons, are in\nfact in this situation. But because the enjoyment of the material\nforms and the union of matter and soul is tainted with suffering and\npain, persons seek liberation. The way out for an individual person is\nto dispel the delusion of the soul by developing the right kind of\npsychical conditions. The right kind of psychical development requires\nproper moral and religious training though it may take an inordinately\nlong time, possibly many rebirths. The end of the delusion also means\nthe end of bondage and with it goes all unhappiness and misery.\nLiberation of the soul consists in indifference towards the\nmanifestation of prak\u1e5bti and with it the renunciation\nof many sensual pleasures and material objects. The puru\u1e63a thus\nreturns to its native enlightened state of bliss. (For an elaborate\naccount of such a delusion and its consequences, see the\n\u015a\u0101ntiparvan of the M\u0101h\u0101bh\u0101rata, Chapter 302\n(verse 41\u201349) and Chapter 303).\n\nThe Yoga school shares much with the S\u0101\u1e43khya regarding the\nnature of the true self and the individual person, differing in its\nemphasis on the yogic practices (psychophysical techniques centering\non meditation) as the means of discovering the true nature of the real\nself. The S\u0101\u1e43khya and Yoga philosophers disagree with the\nAdvaitic thesis that individual persons (j\u012bvas) are only\ndelusions, but agree that the true self, the essence of the person is\nthe soul or consciousness untainted by matter. There is no value to\ndevelopment of persons as such, according to these spiritual\nphilosophies, the only activity worthy of pursuit is the search for\nthe true self.\n",
