Conclusion\n\nThis entry has briefly reviewed and critically evaluated four\ndifferent approaches which draw on empirical psychology to aid us in\nthinking about issues of character. The amount of attention given here\nto each of them is in line with discussions in the philosophy\nliterature. Philosophers in their writings have paid by far the most\nattention to situationism followed by the CAPS model, with the Big\nFive and the VIA classifications hardly getting mentioned at all. This\nis in direct contrast to the current landscape in psychology,\nespecially personality psychology. Perhaps it is time for philosophers\nto shift their attention accordingly.\n",
