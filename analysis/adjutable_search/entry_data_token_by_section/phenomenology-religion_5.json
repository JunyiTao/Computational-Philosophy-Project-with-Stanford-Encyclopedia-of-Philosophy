    "main_text": "Emotions and religious experience || Emotional feelings and relationship to material context\n2.2 Emotional feelings and relationship to material context\n\nThis understanding of emotional feelings can also be brought into\nfruitful dialogue with the second of our models of religious\nexperience, according to which religious experience is not so much a\nmatter of encountering God directly, but is rather concerned with\nfinding a relevant meaning or significance in the ordering of a\nmaterial context.\n\nPeter Goldie notes that when a person falls on ice for the first time,\nthey may come to a new understanding of the dangers presented by ice,\nwhere this additional increment of understanding is in some way\nembedded in their new fearfulness of ice, and may resist formulation\nin linguistic terms. As he puts the point: \u201cComing to think of\nit [ice] in this new way is not to be understood as consisting of\nthinking of it in the old way, plus some added-on phenomenal\ningredient \u2014 feeling perhaps; rather, the whole way of\nexperiencing, or being conscious of, the world is new\u2026\u201d\n(Goldie 2000, pp. 59\u201360). We might suppose in particular that\nwhat has changed is that ice has come to assume a new salience in the\nperson\u2019s experience of the world, with the result that their\nperceptual field is differently structured when they are in the\npresence of ice, so as to give particular prominence to ice.\n\nAgain, there are parallels here with the literature in ethics, which\nhas treated moral perception as not so much a matter of identifying\nsome new fact in a situation of moral choice, as of understanding the\nrelative importance of various facts, and grasping which in particular\ndeserve attention or call for some practical response. For example,\nthe virtuous person may not be able to list some further fact\nconcerning the circumstances of various people in a crowded railway\ncarriage, but the fact that a particular passenger is over-burdened by\ntheir bags, and in some discomfort because they have to stand, may\nweigh with this person. This fact may become salient in their\nperception of the scene, and salience here may be a matter, at least\nin part, of their felt response to the passenger and their\npredicament. (Compare Blum 1994, pp. 31\u201333.)\n\nIn the same sort of way, we might suppose that the religious believer\nwho is approaching a sacred site of the kind that Barrie describes\nwill need to have their attention focussed appropriately. And we might\nthink that this is the role of the various thresholds and their\nassociated challenges for the body. It is because they engender and\ngive expression to the right kind of emotional responsiveness, broadly\none of reverential seriousness, that these preparatory behaviours\nenable a proper appreciation of the sacred space itself. Here, then,\nrather as with the train example, religious experience takes the form\nof viewing some material context with appropriate salience. (Compare\nJonathan Z. Smith\u2019s (1987) proposal that it is the quality of\nattention accorded to sacred objects, in a given context, rather than\nsomething intrinsic to those objects, that marks them out from other\nkinds of object.)\n\n",
