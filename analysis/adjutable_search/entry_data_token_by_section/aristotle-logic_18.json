    "main_text": "Demonstrations and Demonstrative Sciences || The Regress Problem\n6.2 The Regress Problem\n\nIn Posterior Analytics I.2, Aristotle considers two\nchallenges to the possibility of science. One party (dubbed the\n\u201cagnostics\u201d by Jonathan Barnes) began with the following\ntwo premises:\n\nWhatever is scientifically known must be demonstrated.\nThe premises of a demonstration must be scientifically known.\n\n\nThey then argued that demonstration is impossible with the following\ndilemma:\n\nIf the premises of a demonstration are scientifically known, then\nthey must be demonstrated.\nThe premises from which each premise are demonstrated must be\nscientifically known.\nEither this process continues forever, creating an infinite\nregress of premises, or it comes to a stop at some point.\nIf it continues forever, then there are no first premises from\nwhich the subsequent ones are demonstrated, and so nothing is\ndemonstrated.\nOn the other hand, if it comes to a stop at some point, then the\npremises at which it comes to a stop are undemonstrated and therefore\nnot scientifically known; consequently, neither are any of the others\ndeduced from them.\nTherefore, nothing can be demonstrated.\n\n\nA second group accepted the agnostics\u2019 view that scientific\nknowledge comes only from demonstration but rejected their conclusion\nby rejecting the dilemma. Instead, they maintained:\n\nDemonstration \u201cin a circle\u201d is possible, so that it is\npossible for all premises also to be conclusions and therefore\ndemonstrated.\n\n\nAristotle does not give us much information about how circular\ndemonstration was supposed to work, but the most plausible\ninterpretation would be supposing that at least for some set of\nfundamental principles, each principle could be deduced from the\nothers. (Some modern interpreters have compared this position to a\ncoherence theory of knowledge.) However their position worked, the\ncircular demonstrators claimed to have a third alternative avoiding\nthe agnostics\u2019 dilemma, since circular demonstration gives us a\nregress that is both unending (in the sense that we never reach\npremises at which it comes to a stop) and finite (because it works its\nway round the finite circle of premises).\n",
