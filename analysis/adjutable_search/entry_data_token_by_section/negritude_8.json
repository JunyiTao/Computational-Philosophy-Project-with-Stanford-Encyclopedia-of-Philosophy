N\u00e9gritude beyond N\u00e9gritude\n\nReflecting on what has been achieved by the N\u00e9gritude movement,\nLucius Outlaw notes that for all the criticisms it has received,\n\u201cnonetheless, the N\u00e9gritude arguments, fundamentally,\ninvolved a profound displacement of the African invented by\nEuropeans.\u201d And he continues: \u201cIt is this African\nchallenge and displacement, through radical critique and\ncounter-construction, that have been deconstructive in particularly\npowerful and influential ways: involving direct attacks on the assumed\nembodiment of the paragon of humanity in whites of Europe, an attack\nthat forces this embodiment back upon itself, forces it to confront\nits own historicity, its own wretched history of atrocities, and the\nstench of the decay announcing the impending death of the hegemonic\nideal of the Greco-European Rational Man\u201d (Outlaw 1996, 67).\n\nL. Outlaw acknowledges that that was the main point of Sartre\u2019s\nBlack Orpheus. It could now be argued that the question,\ntoday, is no longer that of a \u201cdeconstructive\nchallenge\u201d to \u201cthe hegemonic ideal of the Greco-European\nRational Man\u201d but that of what Outlaw calls \u201cthe\nreconstructive aspects of this challenge\u201d (Outlaw 1996, 68). Has\nN\u00e9gritude anything to contribute, today, to that\nreconstructive aspect? What does it say about the present and future\nof Black arts, since N\u00e9gritude as ontology, as epistemology,\nand even as politics takes us back, according to C\u00e9saire and\nSenghor, to the philosophy of art considered as a vital knowledge of a\nreality conceived as a web of forces?\n\nTo such a question, it can be said that C\u00e9saire had given an\nanswer in the conclusion of his 1966 Dakar address. There could be no\nprescription of what African art should be. There is no model it\nshould imitate not even its own past. It has to continuously invent\nitself and that self invention is not to be separated from the\nquestion of Africa\u2019s self invention. \u201cAfrican art of\ntomorrow will be worth what Africa and the African of tomorrow are\nworth\u201d, C\u00e9saire declared before ending his lecture with\nthese final words: \u201c\u2026 the future of African art is in our\nhands. That is why to the African Heads of States who say: African\nartists, work to save African art, here is what we respond: people of\nAfrica and first of all you, African politicians, because you have\nmore responsibility, give us good African politics, make us a good\nAfrica, create for us an Africa where there are still reasons for\nhope, means for fulfillment, reasons to be proud, give back to Africa\ndignity and health, and African art will be saved\u201d\n(Th\u00e9bia Melsan 2000, 25\u201326).\n\nOne way of raising the question of political relevance is to ask: is\nthere any room for a version of N\u00e9gritude in what could be\nconsidered as a philosophical foundation of black\n solidarity?[16]\n In September 1956, at the First Meeting of Black Writers and Artists\nheld in Paris, at the Sorbonne, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire gave a\nlecture on \u201cCulture and Colonization\u201d (C\u00e9saire\n1956). This was quite a historic reflection, at a time of maturity for\nthe N\u00e9gritude movement and just a few months before the shaking\nof decolonizations started with the independence of Ghana, on the\nrelationship between N\u00e9gritude and Pan-Africanism. \u201cWhat\nis the common denominator\u201d, C\u00e9saire started his lecture\nby asking, \u201cin this assembly gathering people as diverse as\nAfricans from Black Africa, North Americans, Caribbeans and\nMalagasies?\u201d The first obvious answer, he declared, was that\nthey all lived in a situation that could be described as colonial,\nsemi-colonial or para-colonial. In fact, he continued, there are two\naspects in the solidarity of people of African descent gathered then\nat the Sorbonne: one that could be characterized as\n\u201chorizontal\u201d and one \u201cvertical\u201d. The\nhorizontal solidarity is political: Pan-Africanism or Black solidarity\nbetween Africans and the African Diaspora is their common response to\nthe situation of submission to colonialism and racism. The vertical\nsolidarity or \u201csolidarity throughout time\u201d is the way\npeople of African descent manifest different faces of an African\ncivilization. Not to be misunderstood, C\u00e9saire hastens\nto make the precision, with cultural commonality. African cultures in\nAfrica and in the African Diasporas are at least as different as\nItalian culture would be from Norwegian culture. But they share\ncivilizational traits in the same way Norwegian and Italian cultures\nshare European traits. C\u00e9saire\u2019s distinction between\ncultures (characterized by difference) and civilization (defined by\nthe existence of commonalities) would mean that the\n\u201cvertical\u201d dimension of Pan-Africanism is what could be\nidentified as N\u00e9gritude. How do we see Pan-Africanism\ntoday?\n\nOur times are dominated by the postcolonial and anti-essentialist view\nthat differences should not be subsumed under a notion of Black\nidentity which might have worked as a response to colonial negation\nbut does not have any substantial meaning (just what Sartre said in\n1948, when he labeled N\u00e9gritude an \u201canti-racist\nracism\u201d, which Senghor and C\u00e9saire forcefully dismissed,\ninsisting that their antiracist combat should never be confused with\nracism, even a counter or a reverse one). As an example, the\ncr\u00e9olit\u00e9 movement in the Caribbean claimed\ncreoleness as a continuous process of hybridization (\u201cNeither\nEuropeans, nor Africans, nor Asians, we proclaim ourselves\nCreoles\u201d, the Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 writers famously stated at\nthe beginning of the manifesto (Bernab\u00e9, Chamoiseau, and\nConfiant 1990, 75)) turning its back on C\u00e9saire\u2019s\nN\u00e9gritude and his claim of an African heritage as constitutive\nof his identity: N\u00e9gritude is ante-creole, they wrote.\nThis movement established itself as following from Edouard\nGlissant\u2019s philosophy of creolization. This philosophy is based\non a distinction between what Glissant calls \u201catavistic\ncultures\u201d grounded in some \u201ccreation myth of the\nworld\u201d (a group to which sub-Saharan African cultures belong),\nand what he calls \u201ccomposite cultures\u201d \u201cborn from\nhistory\u201d (Glissant 2003, 111). Thus, he asks, \u201cmy own\ngenesis, what is it if not the belly of the slave ship?\u201d Not\nAfrica, then, where the ship was coming from with its hideous freight,\nbut the journey itself, the unpredictable becoming of the voyage to\nnew shores, to new continuously proliferating, rhizomatic identities.\nThe Africanness of African-Americans could be another example. The\ndemand to be called African-Americans after having been\n\u201cNegroes\u201d then \u201cBlacks\u201d has certainly more to\ndo with the internal identity politics of being Americans in the same\nway Irish-Americans or Chinese-Americans are than with any claim of\nsubstantial solidarity with Africans. Pan-Africanism that is\nengagement and solidarity with the African continent has always been\nthe concern of a tiny elite among African Americans (even if it is\nassociated with considerable names such as Marcus Garvey or W.E.B.\nDubois).\n\nWithin the African continent, there is today a renewed attempt at\nreviving Pan-Africanism under the form of African unity, what is\nreferred to sometimes as \u201cthe United States of Africa\u201d.\nThe African Union has thus divided the continent into six great\nregions that should achieve economic and political integration in a\nnear future as a significant step towards continental unity. It is\nsignificant that the decision was made to consider the African\nDiasporas a symbolic sixth region. Is that a gesture which will remain\nsimply symbolic, a last tip of the hat from the new pragmatic\nPan-Africanism to the lyricism of N\u00e9gritude about Black\nSolidarity (it should be noted that Pan-Africanism means that the\ndivide between sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb has no significance\nand that Africans are black as well as of European or Asian descent)?\nIn 1956, C\u00e9saire seemed to have been conscious that a\n\u201chorizontal solidarity\u201d as a response to a shared\ncondition of living under colonial and racist domination was less\nproblematic than a vertical solidarity throughout time binding\ntogether peoples who have come to develop very different cultures or,\nwithin the same nations, very different subcultures. He still believed\nin that shared \u201cN\u00e9gritude\u201d as a\n\u201ccivilization\u201d under which those differences would be\nsubsumed. But above all he believed, against any \u201cincarcerating\nconception of identity\u201d (2004, 92) that N\u00e9gritude,\nultimately, amounts to the continuing fight against racism: \u201cone\ncan renounce the heritage\u201d, he declared in his Miami address but\n\u201chas one the right to renounce the fight\u201d when one\nunderstands that what is at stake today is not N\u00e9gritude but\nracism, \u201cseats of racism\u201d here and there which need to be\nconfronted if we are to \u201cconquer a new and larger\nfraternity\u201d? (2004, 90\u201392)\n\nTo dismiss too quickly N\u00e9gritude as an essentialism of the\npast, which might have been necessary as a \u201cdeconstructive\nchallenge\u201d to an oppressive colonial order but has nothing to\nsay when it comes to the call for cosmopolitanism and creolization,\nwould miss an important dimension of that multifaceted\n movement.[17]\n The essentialist language is pervasive in N\u00e9gritude\nliterature, no doubt, but so is the language of hybridity which can be\nseen as undermining it the way Penelope used to undo at night what she\nhad woven during the day. Senghor is as much a thinker of\n\u201cm\u00e9tissage\u201d (mixture) than he is a thinker of\nN\u00e9gritude. His watchword, \u201ceveryone must be mixed in\ntheir own way\u201d is as central to N\u00e9gritude as the defense\nand illustration of the values of civilization of the black world.\nThere is in fact a de-racialized use of the word\n\u201cn\u00e8gre\u201d by Senghor which is crucial to understand\nwhy painter Pablo Picasso, poets Paul Claudel, Charles P\u00e9guy or\nArthur Rimbaud, philosopher Henri Bergson, etc. have been somehow\nenrolled by Senghor under the banner of\n\u201cN\u00e9gritude\u201d. The message being, ultimately and\nmaybe not so paradoxically, that one does not have to be black to be a\n\u201cn\u00e8gre\u201d.\n",
