    "main_text": "Demonstration and Mathematics\n4. Demonstration and Mathematics\n\n\nBecause of the formal success of his logical theory, Aristotle also\nconsiders most mathematical proofs as having the form of a\nuniversal affirmative syllogism, namely Barbara. (See\nthe section on The Syllogistic in the entry on\n Aristotle's logic.)\n This means\nthat most mathematical theorems are one thing A said of\nanother C and that every mathematical demonstration has a\nmiddle term B which explains the connection between A\nand C. Aristotle provides several examples of such triads of\nterms in mathematics, e.g., two right angles-angles about a\npoint-triangle, or right angle-half two right angles-angle in a\nsemicircle. It has long been noted by commentators that mathematical\nproofs work with a particular case through universal instantiation\n(ekthesis) and then universalize to the general claim, and\nthat not all propositions have the form: A is said of\nB, e.g., Elements 1 1, \u201cTo construct an\nequilateral triangle on a given line.\u201d A more modern objection is\nthat the formal theory of the syllogism as presented in Prior Analytics\n1 1, 3-7 is woefully inadequate to express a theory involving\nconditionals and many-many relations, as is the case with all ancient\nmathematics. Nonetheless, Aristotle does think that most mathematical\nproofs actually do have this form. Those that wouldn't would certainly\nbe negative propositions and possibly existential propositions. (We\nsimply do not know enough about how Aristotle conceived of the logical\nform of existential propositions.) From a careful reading of the rest\nof the Prior Analytics, it becomes clear that Aristotle has a\nflexible notion of \u201cone thing said of another\u201d and that he\nregards standard mathematical proofs as really being in a universal\nform, which we express for purposes of comprehension as particular. \n",
