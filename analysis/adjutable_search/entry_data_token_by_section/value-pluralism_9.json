We experience values as plural, and pluralism\ntells is that values are indeed plural. The monist can respond, as we\nhave seen, that there are ways to explain the apparent plurality of\nvalues without positing fundamentally plural values. Another,\ncomplementary strategy that the monist can pursue is to argue that\nmonism has theoretical virtues that pluralism lacks. In general, it\nseems that theories should be as simple and coherent as possible, and\nthat other things being equal, we should prefer a more coherent theory\nto a less coherent one. Thus so long as monism can make sense of\nenough of our intuitive judgments about the nature of value, then it\nis to be preferred to pluralism because it does better on the\ntheoretical virtue of coherence.\n\nAnother way to put this point is in terms of explanation. The monist\ncan point out that the pluralist picture lacks explanatory depth. It\nseems that a list of values needs some further explanation: what makes\nthese things values? (See Bradley 2009, p.16). The monist picture is\nsuperior, because the monist can provide an explanation for the value\nof the (non-foundational) plurality of values: these things are values\nbecause they contribute to well-being, or pleasure, or whatever the\nfoundational monist value is. (See also the discussion of this in the\nentry on\n value theory).\n\nPatricia Marino argues against this strategy (2015). She argues that\n\u2018systematicity\u2019 (the idea that it is better to have fewer\nprinciples) is not a good argument in favour of monism. Marino points\nout that explanation in terms of fewer fundamental principles is not\nnecessarily better explanation. If there are plural values,\nthen the explanation that appeals to plural values is a better one, in\nthe sense that it is the true one: it doesn\u2019t deny the plurality\nof values. Even if we could give a monist explanation without having\nto trade off against our pluralist intuitions, Marino argues, we have\nno particular reason to think that explanations appealing to fewer\nprinciples are superior.\n",
