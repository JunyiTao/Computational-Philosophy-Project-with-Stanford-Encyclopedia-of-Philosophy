    "main_text": "\n\nAlthough most people value humor, philosophers have said little about\nit, and what they have said is largely critical. Three traditional\ntheories of laughter and humor are examined, along with the theory\nthat humor evolved from mock-aggressive play in apes. Understanding\nhumor as play helps counter the traditional objections to it and\nreveals some of its benefits, including those it shares with\nphilosophy itself.\n",
