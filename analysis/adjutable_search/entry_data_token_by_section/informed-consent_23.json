Exposure to ads and\n\u201cnudges\u201d that promote populations\u2019 health seems\nlegitimate to most of us even when the authority executing the\ninterventions discloses very little about these interventions, their\nrisks, their alternatives, and any real opportunities to avert them.\nChanges to traffic regulations that affect accident rates on a grand\nscale are not thought to demand the consent of each individual\ncitizen. Nor are such changes considered necessary when they are\nexperimental (despite Richter et al. 2001)--health policy trials may\nrequire a very different approach to consent than clinical trials.\n\n\nDifferently put, even in the absence of public health emergencies\n(which can warrant transgressions like forcing individuals to enter\nquarantine), the widely accepted standard in public health seems more\nintrusive than the one in clinical care. As further illustration, many\nwould agree that it is legitimate to implement smoke-free bar laws\nthat somewhat increase anti-smoking stigma, partly in order to goad\nsmokers to quit (and not only as measures to protect third parties\nfrom second-hand smoke). But most would condemn a clinician who\ndeliberately boosts stigma to goad an individual patient to quit\nsmoking (e.g. mocking the stink), and might explain that such pressure\nundermines the patient\u2019s freedom to decide whether to quit. Is\none of these arguably different approaches to informed consent right\nand the other one, wrong? Or is informed consent morally required for\nsome interventions and not for others?\n",
