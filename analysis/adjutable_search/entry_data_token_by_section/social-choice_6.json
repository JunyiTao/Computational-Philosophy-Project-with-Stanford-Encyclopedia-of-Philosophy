    "main_text": "Three formal arguments for majority rule || An epistemic argument for majority rule\n2.3 An epistemic argument for majority rule\n\nCondorcet\u2019s jury theorem provides a consequentialist argument\nfor majority rule. The argument is \u2018epistemic\u2019, insofar as\nthe aggregation rule is interpreted as a truth-tracking device (e.g.,\nGrofman, Owen and Feld 1983; List and Goodin 2001).\n\nSuppose the aim is to make a judgment on some procedure-independent\nfact or state of the world, denoted \\(X\\). In a jury decision, the\ndefendant is either guilty \\((X = 1)\\) or innocent \\((X = -1)\\). In an\nexpert-panel decision on the safety of some technology, the technology\nmay be either safe \\((X = 1)\\) or not \\((X = -1)\\). Each\nindividual\u2019s vote expresses a judgment on that fact or state,\nand the social decision represents the collective judgment. The goal\nis to reach a factually correct collective judgment. Which aggregation\nrule performs best at \u2018tracking the truth\u2019 depends on the\nrelationship between the individual votes and the relevant fact or\nstate of the world.\n\nCondorcet assumed that each individual is better than random at making\na correct judgment (the competence assumption) and that different\nindividuals\u2019 judgments are stochastically independent, given the\nstate of the world (the independence assumption). Formally, let \\(V_1,\nV_2 , \\ldots ,V_n\\) (capital letters) denote the random variables\ngenerating the specific individual votes \\(v_1, v_2 , \\ldots ,v_n\\)\n(small letters), and let \\(V = f(V_1, V_2 , \\ldots ,V_n)\\) denote the\nresulting random variable representing the social decision \\(v =\nf(v_1, v_2 , \\ldots ,v_n)\\) under a given aggregation rule \\(f\\), such\nas majority rule. Condorcet\u2019s assumptions can be stated as\nfollows:\n\n\nCompetence: For each individual \\(i \\in N\\) and each state of\nthe world \\(x \\in \\{-1,1\\}, Pr(V_i = x | X = x) = p \\gt 1/2\\), where\n\\(p\\) is the same across individuals and states.\n\nIndependence: The votes of different individuals \\(V_1, V_2 ,\n\\ldots ,V_n\\) are independent of each other, conditional on each value\n\\(x \\in \\{-1,1\\}\\) of \\(X\\).\n\n\nUnder these assumptions, majority voting is a good truth-tracker:\n\n\nTheorem (Condorcet\u2019s jury theorem): For each state of\nthe world \\(x \\in \\{-1,1\\}\\), the probability of a correct majority\ndecision, \\(Pr(V = x | X = x)\\), is greater than each\nindividual\u2019s probability of a correct vote, \\(Pr(V_i = x | X =\nx)\\), and converges to 1, as the number of individuals \\(n\\)\n increases.[1]\n\n\nThe first conjunct (\u2018is greater than each individual\u2019s\nprobability\u2019) is the non-asymptotic conclusion, the\nsecond (\u2018converges to 1\u2019) the asymptotic\nconclusion. One can further show that, if the two states of the\nworld have an equal prior probability (i.e., \\(Pr(X = 1) = Pr(X = -1)\n= 1/2)\\), majority rule is the most reliable of all aggregation rules,\nmaximizing \\(Pr(V = X)\\) (e.g., Ben-Yashar and Nitzan 1997).\n\nAlthough the jury theorem is often invoked to demonstrate the\nepistemic merits of democracy (for recent discussions, see, e.g.,\nLandemore 2012 and Goodin and Spiekermann 2018), its assumptions are\nhighly idealistic. The competence assumption is not a conceptual claim\nbut an empirical one and depends on any given decision problem.\nAlthough an average (not necessarily equal) individual competence\nabove 1/2 may be sufficient for Condorcet\u2019s conclusion (e.g.,\nGrofman, Owen, and Feld 1983; Boland 1989; Kanazawa\n 1998),[2]\n the theorem ceases to hold if individuals are randomizers (no better\nand no worse than a coin toss) or if they are worse than random \\((p\n\\lt 1/2)\\). In the latter case, the probability of a correct majority\ndecision is less than each individual\u2019s probability of\na correct vote and converges to 0, as the jury size increases. The\ntheorem\u2019s conclusion can also be undermined in less extreme\ncases (Berend and Paroush 1998), for instance when each\nindividual\u2019s reliability, though above 1/2, is an exponentially\ndecreasing function approaching 1/2 with increasing jury size.\n\nSimilarly, whether the independence assumption is true depends on the\ndecision problem in question. Although Condorcet\u2019s conclusion is\nrobust to the presence of some interdependencies between individual\nvotes, the structure of these interdependencies matters (e.g., Boland\n1989; Ladha 1992; Estlund 1994; Berend and Sapir 2007; Pivato 2017).\nIf all individuals\u2019 votes are perfectly correlated with one\nanother or mimic a small number of opinion leaders, the collective\njudgment is no more reliable than the judgment among a small number of\nindependent individuals.\n\nBayesian networks, as employed in Pearl\u2019s account of causation\n(2000), have been used to model the effects of voter dependencies on\nthe jury theorem and to distinguish between stronger and weaker\nvariants of conditional independence (Dietrich and List 2004; Dietrich\nand Spiekermann 2013). This work suggests that, under realistic\nassumptions, Condorcet\u2019s asymptotic conclusion fails to hold,\nand the probability of a correct majority decision converges, at most,\nto a number strictly below 1 (e.g., the probability that the\njury\u2019s evidence is not misleading). Furthermore, Dietrich (2008)\nhas argued that Condorcet\u2019s original two assumptions are never\nsimultaneously justified, in the sense that, even when they are both\ntrue, one cannot obtain evidence to support both at once.\n\nFinally, game-theoretic work challenges an implicit assumption of the\njury theorem, namely that voters will always reveal their judgments\ntruthfully. Even if all voters prefer a correct to an incorrect\ncollective judgment, they may still have incentives to misrepresent\ntheir individual judgments. This can happen when, conditional on the\nevent of being pivotal for the outcome, a voter expects a higher\nchance of bringing about a correct collective judgment by voting\nagainst his or her own private judgment than by voting in\nline with it (Austin-Smith and Banks 1996; Feddersen and Pesendorfer\n1998).\n",
