    "main_text": "Irrealism and Worldmaking || Irrealism\n6.1 Irrealism\nGoodman labels his own position \u201cirrealism\u201d. Irrealism,\nroughly, is the claim that the world dissolves into versions.\nGoodman\u2019s irrealism is certainly the most controversial aspect of his\nphilosophy.\nTwo lines of argument can be separated in Goodman\u2019s writings (Dudau\n2002). First, Goodman argues that there are conflicting statements\nthat cannot be accommodated in a single world version: some truths\nconflict (WW, 109\u201316; MM, 30\u201344). If that is the case, we\nneed many worlds, if any, to accommodate the conflicting versions and\nbring them in unison with the standard correspondence account of\ntruth, that is, that the truth of a statement is its being in\ncorrespondence with a world. The second line of argument seems to be\nthat we need no worlds at all if we need many. If we need a world for\neach version, why postulate the worlds over and above the\nversions?\nLet us first have a closer look at the first line of reasoning. The\nEarth stands still, revolves around the Sun, and runs many other\ncourses as well at the same time. Yet nothing moves while at rest. As\nGoodman concedes, the natural response to this is that the\nsentences\n\n(S1)\nThe Earth is at rest.\n\n(S2)\n The Earth moves.\n\n\nshould be understood as elliptical for\n\n(S1\u2032)\nThe Earth is at rest according to the geocentric system.\n\n(S2\u2032)\nThe Earth moves according to the heliocentric system.\n\n\nHowever, according to Goodman, this would be wrong-headed (WW,\n112).  Consider the following two historiographical sentences:\n\u201cThe kings of Sparta had two votes\u201d and \u201cThe kings\nof Sparta had only one vote\u201d. The first sentence is part of a\nreport by Herodotus, the second part of a report by Thucydides. There\nis, again, an inclination to understand these sentences as ellipses\nfor \u201cAccording to Herodotus, the kings of Sparta had two\nvotes\u201d, and \u201cAccording to Thucydides, the kings of Sparta\nhad only one vote\u201d. But obviously these latter two sentences do\nnot tell us anything about Sparta. They only tell us about what\nHerodotus and Thucydides said about Sparta. It is true that\n\u201caccording to Herodotus, the kings of Sparta had two\nvotes\u201d, even if they actually had no vote or had three\nvotes. The same holds for the relativizations to the geocentric and\nthe heliocentric systems: it is true that the Earth is at rest\naccording to the geocentric system, but that still does not inform us\nabout the world. Thus, if we assume that (S1) and (S2) are both true,\nwe end up with a contradiction if we take them to be literally true of\none and the same world. If we do not take them to be literally true,\nbut to be elliptical and implicitly relativized, we end up with two\ntruths that are not about any world. At least, they are not about the\nparts of the world we were interested in. They turn out to be truths\nabout versions, but not truths about planets. The solution chosen by\nGoodman is to claim that they are about two different worlds. Both\nstate a literal truth about a world, but just not about the same\nworld.\nIt is crucial for Goodman\u2019s argument that in the conflict between\n(S1) and (S2) we have (a) an actual conflict between statements, and\n(b) no other way to resolve that conflict (like, for example,\nrejecting at least one of the two statements in a non-arbitrary\nway). Of course, other contemporaries of Goodman, such as Quine and\nCarnap, also consider the problem that experience alone might\nunderdetermine theory-choice, but believed that pragmatic criteria\nwill in the long run allow us to arrive at one all-encompassing\ncoherent version of the world. In Quine\u2019s (Quine 1981) and Carnap\u2019s\n(Carnap 1932) philosophies, this is assumed to be a physical version.\nBut Goodman does not believe in physicalist reductivism. First of all,\nthere does not currently seem to be any convincing evidence that all\ntruths are reducible to physics (just consider the problem of reducing\nmental truths to physical truths), and, secondly, physics itself does\nnot even appear to form a coherent system (WW, 5). Hence, for Goodman,\nwe are stuck with conflicting world versions we consider true. Since,\nas we have seen above, relativism is no option for\nGoodman\u2014because it would make true statements true about\nversions only\u2014we arrive at Goodman\u2019s pluralism: conflicting true\nversions correspond to different worlds.\nThe second line of reasoning in Goodman\u2019s writings toys with the\nidea that there are no worlds that the right versions answer\nto\u2014or at the very least that such worlds are not necessary. The\nworld versions suffice, and are really the only things that are\ndirectly accessible, anyway. The versions can for many purposes be\ntreated as worlds (WW, 4 and 96; cmp. MM, 30\u201333).\nGoodman of course recognizes a difference between versions and\nworlds. A version can be in English and comprise words. Worlds are\nneither in English nor comprise words. However, for a version that is\ntrue of a world, the world has to answer to it in a way. A world that\n\u201ccorresponds\u201d to (S1), for example, is a world with\nplanets and spacetime that is so arranged that one of the planets,\nEarth, is at rest in it. But \u201cplanet\u201d,\n\u201cspacetime\u201d, \u201cat rest\u201d, and so on are ways to\ncategorize reality that depend on a version. These predicates are the\nones chosen in this very version. There was no world that came ordered\nin correspondence with these predicates before this version was\nconstructed. Instead, the world corresponds to the version expressed\nby (S1), because the world with that structure was made, when that\nversion was made.\nBut what are worlds made of? Should we not at least assume Reality\nto be some kind of stuff that allows structuring with alternative\nversions as dough allows structuring with a cookie-cutter? Does there\nnot have to be some substance for our versions to project structure\nonto? According to Goodman, this \u201ctolerant realist view\u201d\nthat a plurality of worlds can be versions of a unique underlying\nReality is also nothing but a useless addition. A Reality underlying\nthe worlds must be unstructured and neutral, and thus serves no\npurpose. If there are many equally satisfactory versions of the world\nthat are mutually incompatible, then there is not very much left that\nthe \u201cneutral Reality\u201d could be. Reality would have no\nplanets, no motion, no spacetime, no relations, no points, no\nstructure at all. One can assume there is such a thing, Goodman seems\nto admit, but only because Reality is really not worth fighting for\n(or fighting against, for that matter). If we can tell true from false\nversions and explain why some are true versions and others false\nversions of worlds without assuming anything like an underlying\nreality, why assume it then? Parsimony considerations should lead us\nto refrain from postulating it.\n",
