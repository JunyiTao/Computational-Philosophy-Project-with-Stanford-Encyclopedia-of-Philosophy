    "main_text": "Epistemology\n5. Semantics\n\n\nMoral realists have here been characterized as those who hold that\nmoral claims purport to report facts, that they are evaluable as true\nor false in light of whether the facts are as the claims purport, and\nthat at least some such claims are actually true. Many have thought\nthere are good reasons\u2014even decisive reasons\u2014for\nrejecting moral realism so conceived.\n\n\nYet, with the development of (what has come to be called) minimalism\nabout talk of truth and fact, it might seem that this characterization\nmakes being a moral realist easier than it should be. As minimalism\nwould have it, saying that some claim is true is just a way of\n(re-)asserting the claim and carries no commitment beyond that\nexpressed by the original claim. Thus, if one is willing to claim that\n\u201cmurdering innocent children for fun is wrong\u201d one can\ncomfortably claim as well that that \u201cmurdering innocent children\nfor fun is wrong is true\u201d without thereby taking on any\nadditional metaphysical baggage. Since even noncognitivists would\npresumably be willing to claim that \u201cmurdering innocent children\nfor fun is wrong,\u201d they can acknowledge that the claim is true\ntoo and it would be a mistake to see that addition as any sort of\nrenunciation of their noncognitivism. Having said that \u201cit is\ntrue that murdering innocent children for fun is wrong,\u201d it\nseems similarly innocuous for the non-cognitivists to grant that it is\na fact. After all, they can argue, to say of some claim that what it\nsays is a fact is itself just a way of (re-)asserting the claim and it\ntoo carries no commitment beyond that expressed by the original\nclaim. Grammar alone, it seems, renders talk of truth and fact\nappropriate and does so without incurring the sort of metaphysical\ncommitments that are rightly associated with genuine realism (see\nGibbard 2003, Dreier 2005).\n\n\nPutting things this way, though, is misleading. It involves supposing\nthat the noncognitivist has somehow made out what her position comes\nto without appealing to a contrast between, on the one hand, those\nclaims that are properly seen as truth-evaluable and, on the other\nhand, those that are not.  Traditional noncognitivism embraces this\ncontrast and so traditional noncognitivists are able to argue\nintelligibly that moral claims are among those for which truth is\ngenuinely not at issue. They often, against the background of the\ncontrast, go on to explain why moral claims nonetheless mimic so well\nclaims that might actually be true and why we might even talk of them\nbeing \u201ctrue\u201d in a sense (albeit not in the sense in which\nclaims properly understood as cognitive might be true). If, though,\nthe contrast cannot be drawn in terms of whether the claims are\ntruth-evaluable, the noncognitivist needs to offer an alternative\naccount of what marks the difference between the claims concerning\nwhich one should be a noncognitivist and those concerning which one\nshould be a cognitivist. Absent such a contrast, the noncognitivists\nhave no distinctive thesis.\n\n\nError theorists also can find no special comfort in minimalism about\ntruth and fact. After all, to defend their view, error theorists need\nto advance grounds for thinking that, while moral claims are\ntruth-evaluable, none of them are actually true. This requires\nresisting the minimalist urge to make truth so cheap that any sort of\nclaim can have it. That is not to say that an error theorist cannot be\na minimalist about truth and fact. But it is to say that the\nminimalism does not make her position easier (and it may actually make\nher position more difficult) to sustain.\n\n\nMinimalism is, then, no panacea for moral anti-realists.  But it is\nnot poison for them either.  Although minimalism undermines the\nstandard way in which anti-realists mark out their distinctive\nterritory, there is still room for them to defend some alternative\ngrounds for drawing the contrast between the areas about which one is\na realist and those about which one is an anti-realist. For instance,\none might argue that to be a realist about some area (morality or\nwhatever) is to hold that the properties distinctive to that area (in\nthis case moral properties) figure in some fundamental way in our\nexplanations. To be an anti-realist, on this view, is to hold that\nsuch properties do not so figure.  Drawing the contrast in this way\nwould allow an anti-realist still to acknowledge that the properties\nexist (albeit not as fundamental explainers) and that claims ascribing\nthem are sometimes true.  But it is unclear whether the main issues\nthat divide those who consider themselves realists from their\nopponents are best seen as being about whether moral properties\nqualify as fundamental explainers.  Alternatively, one might argue\nthat to be a realist about some area is to hold that the truths\nexpressed by the relevant claims are not mind-dependent. And, the\nsuggestion would be, to be an anti-realist is to think that if there\nare such truths, they are mind-dependent.  This way of drawing the\ncontrast risks ruling out as impossible realism about psychology,\nwhich seems draconian.  And it would immediately count as anti-realist\nthose metaethical views that treat moral facts as response dependent\nor in other ways dependent upon human thought and practice.  So,\nagain, it is unclear whether this contrast lines up properly with the\nmain issues that have divided realists from\nanti-realists. Nonetheless, one might rely on either explanation or\nmind-independence to mark an important contrast between various\nmetaethical views. Paying attention to the stand particular views take\non explanation and mind-independence inevitably helps to keep them in\nfocus and works to mark important questions. \n\n\nWhatever one thinks of minimalism, of the importance of explanation, and\nof mind-independence, moral realism travels with the burden of making\nsense of the semantics of moral terms in a way that will support\nseeing claims that use them as genuinely truth-evaluable. Various\nfeatures of the way in which people rely on such claims in their\nthought and talk support the idea that they are. At the same time,\nthough, some aspects of the ways in which children acquire moral terms\nand the ways in which those terms are bound up with various emotions\npull against seeing the terms as simply on a par with nonmoral\nterms. Working through the ways in which moral claims differ from, as\nwell as the ways in which they are the same as, other claims that\npeople make is essential to getting a full understanding of our moral\nthought and practice. Whether such a full understanding will involve\nseeing us as having moral beliefs (and not just moral reactions) that\nmight be true, is not at all clear. Perhaps even less clear is whether\nand why we might reasonably hold that some of those beliefs are\nactually true. Yet it is pretty clear that people do generally regard\ntheir moral claims, and the moral claims of others, as purporting to\nreport facts, and to the extent they themselves sincerely advance such\nclaims they seem to be regarding at least some such claims as actually\ntrue. The burden is on the anti-realists about morality to argue that\nthat this involves a mistake of some sort.\n",
