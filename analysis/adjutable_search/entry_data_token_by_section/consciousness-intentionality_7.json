    "main_text": "Consciousness in Mind\n8. Consciousness in Mind\n\nHow do views about consciousness, intentionality, and their\nrelationship impinge on the question of what it is to have a mind?\nGiven a thin enough conception of intentionality, we might readily\naccept that having intentionality hardly suffices for having a mind.\nAfter all, street signs, books, and computer files could be said to\nrepresent or refer to things, and whatever we want from a distinction\nbetween the minded and the mindless (or between what has and lacks\ngenuine understanding) we intend it to be more restrictive\nthan that. We may say that the intentionality of true minds\nis obviously a rather different matter than the intentionality of the\nsymbols that minded beings use. But still we may wonder\nexactly what makes for that difference.\n\nCould consciousness perhaps be what confers\n\u201cminded\u201d status? Given a paltry enough conception of\nconsciousness, it\u2019s hard to see how it could\u2014or even how\nit could be necessary to mind at all. If one thinks of consciousness\nas brute, non-intentional sensation, for instance, it may seem not to\nhave much to do with mind in any robust sense. But maybe if the right\nforms of consciousness are recognized, then these, rightly related to\nintentionality, will be enough to make a mind. If one sees\nconsciousness as sufficient for fairly rich and important forms of\nintentionality, one has some prospect for arguing that, since it alone\ncan endow what has it with intentionality of the right sort, only what\nhas it, has a mind.\n\nSuch a proposal requires we recognize some significant, \u201cin\nkind\u201d difference between the minded and the mindless, between\nthose capable of understanding and those devoid of comprehension. Such\nrecognition is not universal. On Dennett\u2019s (1981) view, there is\nfundamentally nothing more to your being, as he puts it, \u201ca true\nbeliever\u201d\u2014and thus nothing more ultimately to mind and\nunderstanding\u2014than being interpretable by observers in the right\nway, via \u201cthe intentional stance\u201d, so as to facilitate\nsuccessful predictions of your behavior. Dennett points out that even\nthe behavior of simple mechanisms like thermostats and natural\nphenomena like lightning can be regarded in this way. He of course\nrecognizes a significant psychological difference between human beings\nand such marginal case \u201cintentional systems\u201d. This is,\nhowever, conceived of as a (considerable) difference of degree. Given\nyour patterns of behavior, observers will be able to use much more\ncomplex intentional state attributions to predict what you\nwill do, so as to get a much bigger pay-off in predictive value, than\nthey will in other cases. But there is no more profound\ndivision among \u201cintentional systems\u201d than this, to be\nmarked by talking about what is conscious and what isn\u2019t. For\nconsciousness is either just some mythical raw feel of\natomic, non-intentional, ineffable \u201cqualia\u201d, or else it\nhas to do with the fact that a predictive advantage accrues from\nregarding systems as possessed of some assortment of capacities, the\nexercise of at least some of which one is inclined to call\n\u201cconscious\u201d. But such differences are again a matter of\ndegree, and the capacities in question exhibit no deep unity (Dennett\n1991).\n\nHowever, many will think there is more to mind (and to consciousness)\nthan Dennett allows. In offering an alternative to his perspective,\none might try to locate the basic difference in kind between minded\nand mindless beings in something other than consciousness. (See, e.g.,\nBurge 2007. For a critique of his approach, see Morgan 2018.) Here\nhowever, we will briefly consider how one might put consciousness to\nwork.\n\nWays of making consciousness integral to mind are potentially very\ndiverse. The issue will look rather different, for example, depending\non whether one adopts this or that reductive intentionalist view.\nSuppose you hold that consciousness is reducible to states generated\nby sensory mechanisms, feeding the information they bear to certain\nother cognitive faculties. Then, to maintain consciousness is\nessential to mind, you would presumably need to maintain a broadly\nempiricist view that required such sensory input for mind. And a\nquestion would then arise about the sufficiency of\nconsciousness for mind\u2014at least for mind at a human\nlevel\u2014as one may doubt that such perception by itself brings\nwith it the requisite kind of understanding. On the other hand, if\none\u2019s reductive representationalism appeals to some sort of\nhigher-order or self-representational account, one would need a\nconception of mind that explained why some such self-monitoring is\nnecessary to\u2014and how it could be enough\nfor\u2014mindedness.\n\nGenerally, recent views that (explicitly or implicitly) make\nconsciousness central to mind have tended not to base their arguments\non reductive intentionalism. Some relevant strategies of argument\nunreliant on reductivist accounts are sometimes gathered under the\nrubric of \u201cPhenomenal Intentionality Theory\u201d. Such views\naim to show how all intentionality may be traced to\nphenomenal intentionality.\n\nThis approach often trades on the idea that there is a difference\nbetween what comes by intentionality in some secondary or derivative\nway (as when an image or inscription is interpreted as referring to\nsomething), and what has intentionality in an original or more\nfundamental way. The proposal would be: consciousness, and only\nconsciousness, brings with it original intentionality. It\nwould be natural to assume further that only beings that have original\nintentionality truly have minds. Consider how this works in the case\nof Searle (1990, 1992). He distinguishes between what he calls\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d intentionality on the one hand, and merely\n\u201cas if\u201d and \u201cinterpreter relative\u201d\nintentionality, on the other. We sometimes may speak as if\nartifacts (like thermostats) had thoughts and wants (\u201cMr.\nThermostat thinks it\u2019s too warm in here\u201d)\u2014but this\nisn\u2019t to be taken literally. And we may impose conditions of\nsatisfaction on our acts and creations (words, pictures, diagrams,\netc.) by our interpretation of them\u2014but they have no\nintentionality independent of our interpretive practices. The\nintentionality of mental states, on the other hand, is neither a mere\nmanner of speech, nor is our possession of it derived from\nothers\u2019 interpretive stance towards us. But then: what accounts\nfor the fact that some states of affairs in the world have intrinsic\nintentionality\u2014that they are directed at objects under\naspects\u2014and why they are directed under the aspects they are\n(why they have the content they do)? With conscious states of\nmind, Searle says, their phenomenal or subjective character determines\ntheir aspectual shape. Where non-conscious states of mind are\nconcerned, there is nothing to do the job but their relationship to\nconsciousness. The right relationship, he holds, is this:\nnon-conscious states of mind must be potentially conscious. If some\npsychological theories (of language, of vision) postulate an\nunconscious so deeply buried that its mental representations cannot\neven potentially become conscious, so much the worse for those\ntheories.\n\nSearle\u2019s views have aroused a number of criticisms. (See the\npeer commentary in response to Searle 1990.) Among the problem areas\nare these. First, how are we to spell out the requirement that\nintrinsically intentional states be potentially conscious, without\nmaking it either too easy or to difficult to satisfy? Second, just why\nis it that the intrinsic intentionality of non-conscious states needs\naccounting for, while that of conscious states is somehow\nunproblematic? Third, it appears Searle\u2019s argument does not\noffer some general reason to rule out all efforts to give\n\u201cnaturalistic\u201d accounts of conditions sufficient to\nimpose\u2014without the help of consciousness\u2014genuine and not\nmerely interpreter relative intentionality.\n\nOne way to get around some of the problems of Searle\u2019s account,\nwhile similarly holding that all intentionality is tied to\nconsciousness, would be to argue that non-experiential\n\u201caboutness\u201d can be found all too pervasively, and had all\ntoo cheaply\u2014so that only the aboutness that experience\nbrings should be considered \u201creal intentionality\u201d. This,\nroughly, is the view Galen Strawson (2008) proposes. He acknowledges\nwe may try to narrow the attribution of intentionality, and avoid a\ntrivializing Dennett-like proliferation of \u201cintentional\nsystems\u201d\u2014but without appeal to consciousness. We might,\nfor example, propose that real intentionality depends on\nevolution-imposed functions to indicate. But such approaches he thinks\noffer us no truly principled demarcation; they end up simply\ndismissing legitimate counterexamples, and ultimately trade on\n\u201canthropomorphic/zoomorphic human prejudices\u201d. However,\nonce we recognize that \u201cexperiential qualitative\ncharacter\u201d encompasses a richly diverse range of sensory and\ncognitive states, we will be able to see how it also can constrain\nwhat our perceptions are of, and what our thoughts are\nabout; only such consciousness-imposed constraints will give\nus a non-arbitrary \u201cstopping place\u201d for their of-ness or\naboutness to find an object.\n\nKriegel\u2019s 2011 version of Phenomenal Intentionality Theory\npursues a line of thought with resemblances to both Searle\u2019s and\nStrawson\u2019s. Drawing a distinction between original and\ninterpreter-relative intentionality, he argues consciousness is the\nsole locus of the former: consciousness \u201cinjects intentionality\ninto the world\u201d. However, unlike Searle, Kriegel has\nconsciousness confer intentionality both on otherwise meaningless\nsymbols and on unconscious mental or cognitive life in much the same\nway. What has nonexperiential intentionality gets its aboutness by\nbeing such as would be seen to have it in the experience of an\n\u201cideal interpreter\u201d. Kriegel, in effect, takes the sort of\n\u201cinterpretivist\u201d view of intentionality advocated by\nDennett, while (unlike Dennett) confining it to cases where\nconsciousness is missing. Thus it seems he should want to reject\ntheories like Dennett\u2019s that purport to account for\nconsciousness in terms of intentional or representational notions that\ndo not presuppose it. This creates a difficulty, inasmuch as Kriegel\nalso proposes a self-representationalist account of consciousness that\nseems to follow that general reductive representationalist strategy.\nHe responds to this problem by distinguishing the sort of natural (or\nobjective) \u201ctracking\u201d mental representation that figures\nas a posit in psychological theorizing from the sort of mental\nrepresentation we are familiar with from reflection on our own minds,\nwith its susceptibility to the appearance/reality distinction.\nConsciousness, Kriegel argues, is what accounts for the latter.\n\nAngela Mendelovici (2018) advances another type of\n\u201cconsciousness first\u201d view. What does the crucial work in\nher argument is the demand that an account of mental representation\nattribute it in accordance with our introspective judgments about\nit\u2014leading neither to a \u201cmismatch\u201d with\nthis (as, she says, \u201ctracking\u201d accounts of visual\nrepresentation do with respect to color), nor to unacceptable\nindeterminacies in the content assigned (which she finds are\ninevitable with non-tracking functional role accounts). Only an\naccount that bases intentionality on phenomenal character can avoid\nthese problems, she argues; and she explains how such special content\n\u201cmatching\u201d challenges that theory prompts can be\novercome.\n\nThere are also consciousness-based accounts of mind that do\nnot depend on an original/derived intentionality distinction\n(as do Searle\u2019s, Kriegel\u2019s, and Mendelovici\u2019s). Consider, for example,\nthe argument proposed by Kirk Ludwig (1996a). He argues that\nconsciousness is needed to rightly draw the boundaries of an\nindividual\u2019s mind\u2014for there is nothing to determine\nwhose state of mind a given non-conscious state of mind is,\nunless that state consists in a disposition to produce a conscious\nmental state of the right sort. Alleged mental processes that did not\ntend to produce someone\u2019s conscious states of mind appropriately\nwould be no one\u2019s, which is to say that they would not be mental\nstates at all. Roughly: consciousness provides the unity of mind\nwithout which there would be no mind. Only with consciousness do we\nhave a suitable boundary between what\u2019s in a mind, and\nwhat\u2019s outside of it. And Ludwig argues that it is therefore a\nmistake to attribute to our minds many of the unconscious\ninferences with which psychological theorists have long been wont to\npopulate the brain\u2019s visual system.\n\nAnother approach that makes consciousness central (but without appeal\nto an original/derived contrast) is that of Declan Smithies 2019. For\nhim, crucially, beliefs are essentially rationally assessable states,\ncapable of justifying and being justified. And we can properly account\nfor their epistemic status, he argues, only by understanding them in\nterms of consciousness\u2014as dispositions to conscious\njudgments. For only this will yield the intuitively right verdicts\nregarding when someone is favorably or unfavorably assessable with\nrespect to epistemic norms. And only this will properly cohere with a\ngeneral epistemology that correctly links justification to\nintrospectability, and introspection to consciousness. Thus, while we\nmay conceive of beings behaviorally similar to us, but bereft of\nsubjective experience (\u201czombies\u201d of a sort), we should not\nsuppose they would literally have person-level, rationally assessable\nattitudes, even if they harbored internal representations playing\ncasual roles with respect to their behavior. Without the right sort of\nconsciousness, they couldn\u2019t have the introspective\nself-knowledge they need to be properly subject to epistemic norms,\nand so couldn\u2019t literally have attitudes like beliefs.\n\nAnother way to give consciousness a starring role is suggested by\nSiewert 2014 who uses consideration of blindsight scenarios to argue\nthat the only perception that will supply the mind with an\nunderstanding of type demonstratives (e.g., \u201cthis\nshape\u201d) and so be capable of functioning in empirical concept\nacquisition, is the experiential, conscious kind. (If this\nshape looks no way to you at all, you will not understand by\nvision just which shape this shape is, and thus\nwon\u2019t be in a position to learn visually, e.g., this shape\nis a circle.) Partly on these grounds it is argued that mind\nrequires consciousness. And given a cognitively rich view of\nexperience, we can see how consciousness (of the right sort) will be\nsufficient for mind as well. Siewert\u2019s view, like\nSmithies\u2019, sets aside the original/derived contrast. But both\ncrucially rely (as does Searle\u2019s) on a requirement that certain\nfacts about the mind should be discernible from the first-person point\nof view. Doubts about these views are likely to challenge the\nlegitimacy of that reliance (see, e.g., Shoemaker\u2019s 1994\ncriticism of Searle).\n\nFinally, Adam Pautz (2013, 2021) argues that intentionality is based\non consciousness in a way that combines an empiricist appeal to\ninterpretation theory with a rejection of the idea that our experience\nof thought and understnding is inherently cognitive. Embracing a\nnonreductive representationalist view of the phenomenal character of\nperceptual experience, Pautz draws on a Lewisian theory of\ninterpretation to argue that we can satisfactorily account for the\ndeterminacy of our mental content if (but only if) we take the\nphenomenal intentionality of perceptual experience as basic. Our\nthoughts have the content they do not because their phenomenal\ncharacter is inherently conceptual, but because the best\ninterpretation of the totality of the perceptual experience we have\nand are disposed to have would assign us that thought content.\n",
