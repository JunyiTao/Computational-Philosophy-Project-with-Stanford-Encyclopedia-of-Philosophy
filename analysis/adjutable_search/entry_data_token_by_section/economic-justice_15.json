    "main_text": "Bargaining and Cooperative Games || Nash\u2019s and Other Solutions\n5.1 Nash\u2019s and Other Solutions\n\nNash (1950) adopted a welfarist framework, in which alternatives are\ndescribed only by the utility levels they give to the two parties. His\nsolution consists in choosing the alternative which, in the feasible\nset, maximizes the product of individual utility gains from the\ndisagreement point (this point is the fallback option when the parties\nfail to reach an agreement). This solution is therefore related to a\nparticular social welfare function which is somehow intermediate\nbetween sum-utilitarianism and the maximin criterion. Contrary to\nthese, however, it is invariant to independent changes in utility\nzeros and scales, which means that it can be applied with utility\nfunctions which are defined only up to an affine transformation (i.e.,\nno difference is made between utility function Ui\nand utility function ai Ui +\nbi), such as Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility\nfunctions. Nash uses this invariance property in his axiomatic\ncharacterization of the solution. He also uses another property, which\nholds for any solution maximizing a social welfare function, namely,\nthat removing non-selected options does not alter the choice.\n\nThis particular property is criticized in Kalai and Smorodinsky\n(1975), because it makes the solution ignore the relative size of the\nsacrifices made by the parties in order to reach a compromise. They\npropose another solution, which consists of equalizing the\nparties\u2019 sacrifice relative to the maximum gain they could\nexpect in the available set of options. This solution, contrary to\nNash\u2019s, guarantees that an enlargement of the set of options\nthat is favorable to one party never hurts this party in the ultimate\nselection. It is very similar to Gauthier\u2019s (1986)\n\u201cminimax relative concession\u201d solution. Many other\nsolutions to the bargaining problem have been proposed, but these two\nare by far the most prominent.\n\nThe relevance of bargaining theory to the theory of distributive\njustice has been questioned. First, if the disagreement point is\ndefined, as it probably should, in relation to the relative strength\nof parties in a \u201cstate of nature\u201d, then the scope for\nredistributive solidarity is very limited. One obtains a theory of\n\u201cjustice as mutual advantage\u201d (Barry 1989, 1995) which is\nnot satisfactory at the bar of any minimal conception of impartiality\nor equality. Second, the welfarist formal framework of the theory of\nbargaining is poor in information (Roemer 1986b, 1996). Describing\nalternatives only in terms of utility levels makes it impossible to\ntake account of basic physical features of allocations. For instance,\nit is impossible to find out, from utility data alone, which of the\nalternatives is a competitive equilibrium with equal shares. As\nanother illustration, Nash\u2019s and Kalai and Smorodinsky\u2019s\nsolutions both recommend allocating an indivisible prize by a\nfifty-fifty lottery, whether the prize is symmetric (a one-dollar bill\nfor either party) or asymmetric (a one-dollar bill if party 1 wins,\nten dollars if party 2 wins).\n\nExtensive surveys of bargaining theory can be found in Peters (1992),\nThomson (1999).\n",
