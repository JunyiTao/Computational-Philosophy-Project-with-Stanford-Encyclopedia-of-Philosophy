    "main_text": "Some Views on God and Time || Divine Timelessness\n4.1 Divine Timelessness\n4.1.1 Pure Atemporalism\n\nOn this view, God is not located in time and God\u2019s life does not\nhave any temporal features. This is a natural first gloss of the\ntimelessness position. However, few defenders of divine timelessness\nsign up to this view. It has been suggested that Maimonides and\nSchleiermacher may hold it (Leftow 2005; actually, the view Leftow\nattributes to these authors is that God has no \u201ctypically\ntemporal properties\u201d (TTPs); see the end of\n section 4.1.3).\n4.1.2 Atemporal Duration\n\nBoethius has strongly influenced the contemporary landscape. Much of\nthis influence flows through work by Eleonore Stump and Norman\nKretzmann (hereafter S&K 1981, 1987, 1992).\n\nRecall Boethius (Consolation, V.VI., here in a different\ntranslation, by Stewart et al. 1973): \u201cEternity [\u2026] is\nthe whole, simultaneous, and perfect possession of boundless\nlife\u201d. Or again, eternity is the complete possession all at once\nof illimitable life.\n\nStump and Kretzmann distill four ingredients from this claim.\n\nA timeless being has life (of a non-biological kind), i.e. is\nalive. That is, abstracta (if there are any), like numbers or sets,\ndon\u2019t count. Neither would the world, even if it was\nsempiternal.\nThe life of a timeless being is without limit and cannot be\nlimited. It cannot begin or end. It is impossible for it not to have\ninfinite duration.\nThe life of a timeless being therefore involves a special sort of,\natemporal, duration.\nA timeless being\npossesses its life all at once, completely. That is, it doesn\u2019t\nexperience succession. This, according to Stump and Kretzmann, is what\nmakes it the case that a timeless being is outside of time. By\ncontrast, a living being in time experiences succession, only ever\npossessing one moment of its life at a time.\n\n\nNot only does a timeless being not experience succession, but its\nlife\u2019s events don\u2019t involve succession. Since change\nrequires succession, a timeless being doesn\u2019t change. But a\ntimeless being is still presently alive in some sense of\n\u201cpresently\u201d. Moreover, the events in that being\u2019s\nlife are simultaneous in some sense, both with each other and with\ntemporal items.\n\nTo show how, Stump and Kretzmann coin the notion of Eternal-Temporal\nSimultaneity (\u201cET-simultaneity\u201d). First, define an\n\u201ceternal present\u201d to be an infinitely extended, pastless,\nfutureless duration (strictly speaking, on the terminology used here,\nit should be \u201ctimeless present\u201d). Then let Temporal\nSimultaneity (\u201cT-simultaneity\u201d) be existence/occurrence at\nthe same time, and let Eternal Simultaneity\n(\u201cE-simultaneity\u201d) be existence/occurrence at the same\neternal present. Each involves only one mode of existence, namely\neither the temporal or the eternal. ET-simultaneity, by contrast,\nrelates items in different modes of existence, one temporal, and one\neternal.\n\nStump & Kretzmann base their definition of ET-simultaneity on\nnotions borrowed from some presentations of special relativity:\n\n\nLet \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(y\\)\u201d range over\nentities and events. [\u2026]\n\n(ET)\nFor every \\(x\\) and every \\(y\\), \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nET-simultaneous if and only if:\n  \ni.\neither \\(x\\) is eternal and \\(y\\) is temporal, or vice versa;\nand\nii.\nfor some observer, \\(A\\), in the unique eternal reference frame,\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both present\u2014that is, either \\(x\\) is\neternally present and \\(y\\) is observed as temporally present, or vice\nversa; and\niii.\nfor some observer, \\(B\\), in one of the infinitely many temporal\nreference frames, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both present\u2014that is,\neither \\(x\\) is observed as eternally present and \\(y\\) is temporally\npresent, or vice versa. (S&K 1981: 439)\n\n\n\n\nThey also offer the following image. Imagine two parallel horizontal\nlines. The lower line represents time, and the upper one represents\ntimeless eternity. Presentness is represented by light. The temporal\npresent is represented by a light that moves steadily along the lower\nline, while the eternal present is represented by the upper line being\nlit all at once. Each dot in the lower line, when it is temporally\npresent, is ET-simultaneous with the whole of the upper line. Or at\nleast this is so from the viewpoint of that time. From the viewpoint\nof eternity, the entire lower line is lit up; each time \u201cinsofar\nas [it] is temporally present\u201d is ET-simultaneous with the whole\nupper line (S&K 1992: 475).\n\nSince, by definition, two items can only be ET-simultaneous if one is\ntemporal and the other eternal, and since any given item is only one\nof these, ET-simultaneity is not reflexive; in fact, it never holds\nbetween an entity and itself. Nor is it transitive; in fact, when\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are ET-simultaneous and \\(y\\) and \\(z\\)\nare too, \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) never are. The non-transitivity of\nET-simultaneity is needed to solve a pressing problem. If \\(t\\) is\nsimultaneous with eternity, and eternity is simultaneous with \\(t'\\),\nthen \\(t\\) is simultaneous with \\(t'\\). So, all times collapse into\none:\n\n\nBut, on St. Thomas\u2019 view, my typing of this paper is\nsimultaneous with the whole of eternity. Again, on his view, the great\nfire of Rome is simultaneous with the whole of eternity. Therefore,\nwhile I type these very words, Nero fiddles heartlessly on. (Kenny\n1979: 38\u20139)\n\n\nThe Stump & Kretzmann proposal has generated much discussion. Here\nare three questions that have been raised.\n\nFirst, is the notion of an atemporal duration coherent? (See\nFitzgerald 1985; also Craig 1999; Nelson 1987; Helm 1988: 35.) What\nlicenses speaking of a duration here? The eternal present is supposed\nnot to be pointlike, but to involve an infinite stretch or extension\nof some kind. This suggests that it should possess some of the formal\nfeatures of extension. For example, it should be possible for two\nparticulars to have the same or different amounts of the extension. If\nthis is not the case with atemporal duration, then how is it a\nduration? And if it is the case, then how is it not a temporal\nduration?\n A proponent of this view may insist that such features are not\npossessed by atemporal duration, because such features are had only if\nthe extension in question is divisible (S&K 1987, 1992). And the\neternal present is not. In support of this, they may suggest that not\neven all temporal extension is divisible. Consider our temporal\nexperience on short time scales and the doctrine of the\n\u201cspecious present\u201d. On that doctrine, temporal experience\ninvolves a temporally extended content. Perhaps this is not even\nconceptually divisible, even though it\u2019s a temporal extension\n(S&K 1992: 468). The comparison is particularly apt if one wants\nto think of the eternal present as God\u2019s specious present\nencompassing all of time (Alston 1984, also Leftow 1991: 143; though\nsee Oppy 1998, in Other Internet Resources, for a critique of this\nidea).\n\nMoreover (they may add), even if all temporal extension is divisible,\nthis doesn\u2019t show that all extension is. Pressed to justify\ntheir use of the term \u201cextension\u201d and explain its\nconnection to ordinary usage, they point to other cases in theology of\nirreducibly analogical predication (see Rogers 1994 for objections to\nthis move).\n\nSecond, what can it mean for something eternally present to observe\nsomething as in the temporal present, and vice versa?  (See Lewis\n1984; also Nelson 1987; Padgett 1992: 69; Swinburne 1993.) Suppose\nsomething eternal observes something as temporally present. If that\nmeans it observes something that comes to be, then doesn\u2019t the\nobservation itself come to be, making the being temporal? Conversely,\nhow can a temporal entity observe something as being eternal? How can\nit observe anything without bringing that thing into the temporal\nseries? After all, the event of \\(x\\)\u2019s observing \\(y\\)\nat \\(t\\) is identical with the event of \\(y\\)\u2019s being\nobserved by \\(x\\) at\n\\(t\\).\n\nConsider this revised definition of ET-simultaneity:\n\n(ET\u2032)\nFor every \\(x\\) and every \\(y\\), \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nET-simultaneous if and only if\n \ni.\neither \\(x\\) is eternal and \\(y\\) is temporal, or vice\nversa (for convenience, let \\(x\\) be eternal and \\(y\\)\ntemporal); and\nii.\nwith respect to some \\(A\\) in the unique eternal reference\nframe, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both present\u2014i.e., (a) \\(x\\)\nis in the eternal present with respect to \\(A\\), (b) \\(y\\) is in\nthe temporal present, and (c) both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are situated\nwith respect to \\(A\\) in such a way that \\(A\\) can enter into\ndirect and immediate causal relations with each of them and (if\ncapable of awareness) can be directly aware of each of them; and\niii.\nwith respect to some \\(B\\) in one of the infinitely many temporal\nreference frames, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both present\u2014i.e.,\n(a) \\(x\\) is in the eternal present, (b) \\(y\\) is at the same\ntime as \\(B\\), and (c) both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are situated with\nrespect to B in such a way that B can enter into direct and immediate\ncausal relations with each of them and (if capable of awareness) can\nbe directly aware of each of them. (S&K 1992: 477\u20138)\n\n\n\nDoes this provide an answer to the objection, or does it rely on one?\nAs pointed out by Brian Leftow in a similar context (Leftow 1991: 173;\nalso Fales 1997), on the view proposed, the temporal and the eternal\ncan enter into causal relations only if they are in some sense\nsimultaneous. That is the reason ET-simultaneity is invoked. If one\nthen relies on a notion of ET-causality in the definition of\nET-simultaneity one faces a problem of circularity.\n\nThird, what role, if any, is special relativity playing in the\nproposal? The intended role is a considerable one. Considerations of\nthe relativity of simultaneity are supposed to show that the\ndifficulties with the notion of ET-simultaneity are \u201cby no means\nunique\u201d and \u201ccannot be assumed to be difficulties in the\nconcepts of ET-simultaneity or of eternity themselves\u201d (S&K\n1981: 439). But it is hard to see how they could show this. Stump and\nKretzmann emphasize the finding that simultaneity is a three-place\nrelation and present it as a response to a threat of incoherence (two\ndistant events being both \u201csimultaneous [\u2026] and not\nsimultaneous\u201d (S&K 1981: 437)).  But the difficulties with\nET-simultaneity arise whether it is two-place or three-place. They\npertain to spelling out what an eternal present and the unique eternal\nframe of reference might be, and how there can be causal relations,\nincluding observational ones, between a being in it and us. No\ncomparable difficulties are involved in special relativity (Fales\n1997; also Padgett 1992: 71; Craig 2009).\n4.1.3 The time of timeless eternity\n\nFor Brian Leftow, the central idea is that all things in time are\nalso, with God, in timeless eternity. He finds this idea in Anselm.\nLike in the Stump and Kretzmann proposal, the idea is given a\ncontemporary twist through appeals to the notion of a reference frame\nand special relativity.\n\nConsider the claim that God has no spatial location. Since there can\nbe a spatial distance only between things or locations in space, this\nimplies that there is no spatial distance between God and things in\nspace. From this, Leftow infers that the distance between God and any\nthing in space is zero (the \u201cZero Thesis\u201d) (Leftow 1991:\n222).\n\nThe Zero Thesis says not only that the distance between God and any\nspatial thing is zero, but also that it always is zero. Therefore\nnothing ever moves with respect to God. Moreover, all change\nsupervenes on motion, e.g., change in color supervenes on motion in\nmicroparticles. So there is no change with respect to God (Leftow\n1991: 227). Therefore, God and all spatial things share a frame of\nreference, the reference frame of eternity, in which nothing changes.\nIn this reference frame, all events are simultaneous, including\nGod\u2019s actions and their effects. That is, they all occur at\neternity, and eternity is something like another time, so they are all\nsimultaneous. But in other, temporal reference frames, this is not the\ncase. In these, God\u2019s actions occur at eternity but their\neffects occur at particular points in time. So in these frames, they\nare nonsimultaneous. And this is where special relativity comes in.\nAfter all, the relativity of simultaneity shows that events\nsimultaneous in one frame of reference may be nonsimultaneous in\nothers.\n Unfortunately, the Zero Thesis and Leftow\u2019s case for it are\nproblematic. From the fact that there is no spatial distance between\nspatial things and God, it does not follow that the spatial distance\nbetween spatial things and God is zero. A similar inference leads one\nto claim that all spatial things are spatially contiguous with yellow\nand the number 3. Leftow is of course aware of this consequence, and\naccepts it as a surprising finding about yellow and the number 3; he\nargues that the Zero Thesis only seems problematic because one fails\nto notice that a distance of zero is just an absence of distance\n(Leftow 1991: 225). However, a distance of zero would seem to be a\ndistance, not an absence of distance (Oppy 1998, in Other Internet\nResources).\n\nAs before, it\u2019s hard to see how talk of reference frames and\nappeals to the relativity of simultaneity can be helpful or even\nrelevant. A reference frame is a system of physical devices such as\nmeasuring rods and clocks that allow an observer to fix the positions\nof events. It\u2019s not clear how timeless eternity can be such a\nsystem. Nor is it clear how timeless eternity can, in addition, be\n(like) a time, simultaneity with which can be the outcome of\nmeasurements.\n\nBefore turning to further elements of Leftow\u2019s view, it is\nuseful to pause to describe some background on the metaphysics of time\n(see also the SEP entries on\n time,\n John M.E. McTaggart, and\n being and becoming in modern physics).\n McTaggart distinguished between the A-series and the B-series of\nevents. The A-series runs from the future through the present and into\nthe past, while the B-series runs from earlier to later (McTaggart\n1908). This distinction survives in the form of the contemporary\nopposition between the B-theory and (various versions of) the A-theory\nof time.\n\nAccording to the B-theory (tenseless theory, block universe view), (a)\nall times and/or events exist and are equally real (this is known as\neternalism\u2014not to be confused with divine timelessness which has\nalso sometimes gone by the same name); and (b) there is a complete\ntenseless description of temporal reality. A tenseless description is\none that stays accurate, because it mentions only such things as which\nevents happen when, and how they are temporally related to one\nanother. So it mentions only facts about B-relations like simultaneity\nand succession. Call these tenseless facts. The B-theory combines\neternalism with the claim that there is a complete description of\ntemporal reality, a description of temporal reality at its most\nfundamental, that doesn\u2019t mention any tensed facts, like that\nit\u2019s 12:00 now.\n\nOpposed to this are various versions of the A-theory, which deny one\nor both of (a) and (b). What these A-theoretic views (including\neternalist and non-eternalist ones, like presentism or the growing\nblock view) have in common is that they metaphysically privilege one\ntime. Fundamental tensed facts capture this privilege. One prominent\nmotivation for the A-theory is the conviction that time passes\n(robustly\u2014i.e. in a sense that goes beyond mere B-theoretic\ntemporal succession (see Skow 2015: 2); in what follows that\u2019s\nwhat I mean by \u201ctemporal passage\u201d). As time passes, the\ntensed facts change: first it\u2019s a fundamental fact that\nit\u2019s 12:00, then that it\u2019s 12:01.\n\nNow return to Leftow\u2019s view. Let A-occurring be occurring now,\nand let B-occurring be occurring at a certain temporal location\nt that is now. (This is intended to be continuous with\nMcTaggart\u2019s distinction.) B-occurring entails A-occurring: if\nsomething occurs at a temporal B-location t that is now, it\noccurs now. But not vice versa. Something can occur now without\noccurring at a temporal B-location t that is now. Something\ncan, that is, A-occur without B-occurring. Now define A-simultaneity\nas occurring \u201cat the same now\u201d. B-simultaneity, by\ncontrast, is having the same temporal B-location in some B-series. If\ntwo events are B-simultaneous and they B-occur (i.e. they are located\nat the same B-temporal location that is now), they are A-simultaneous.\nAnd if two events occur at the same atemporal now and A-occur (i.e.\noccur now), they are also A-simultaneous.\n\nThe upshot is that \n\n\nthe A-simultaneity that obtains between a timeless God and temporal\nentities is univocal with the A-simultaneity that obtains between\ntemporal entities. (Leftow 1991: 239) \n\n\nThis would make the relation between temporal entities and the\ntimeless God less mysterious than it is on the Stump & Kretzmann\nproposal, on which ET-simultaneity is sui generis, obtaining only\nbetween one temporal and one eternal relatum.\n\nBut this seems to be an advance that was gained by stipulation,\nbecause the discussion started thus: \u201c[L]et us so understand\n\u2018now\u2019 that occurring now does not entail having a position\nin a B-series of earlier and later events. That is, let us in effect\ntake \u2018now\u2019 and \u2018occurring now\u2019 as primitive\nterms univocally applicable to temporal and eternal or timeless\nthings\u201d (Leftow 1991: 239). It\u2019s not surprising that given\nthis initial stipulation, the ensuing definitions allow one to say\nthat the A-simultaneity that obtains between temporal entities is the\nsame relation that obtains between a timeless God and temporal\nentities.\n\nAccording to Leftow, there can be no change in (timeless) eternity,\nand in eternity, all events happen (A-) simultaneously. However, in\nsome places eternity is instead described as involving succession,\nnamely as consisting of a number of different B-series corresponding\nto different temporal reference frames (Leftow 1991: 239). Prima\nfacie, these are different, incompatible ideas. B-theorists, who\nhold that time, fundamentally, consists of events standing in\nB-relations of precedence and simultaneity, do not also hold that all\nof time collapses to a single time.\n\nThis is relevant to the notion of Quasi-Temporal Eternality (QTE,\nLeftow 1991: 120\u20132). Unlike Stump & Kretzmann, Leftow holds\nthat atemporal duration, understood as QTE, involves distinct points\nbut not parts. These points are (at least in some sense) earlier and\nlater than one another, but they do not stand in the relation of\nsuccession. This seemingly paradoxical claim is partly defended via\nappeals to the B-theory. The idea is that Boethian eternity is like an\nextension in B-time, and that a QTE being\u2019s life contains\nearlier and later points with no succession between them. In this\nrespect, we are told, it is like life in B-time, only without an\nillusion of temporal passage.\n\nThere is a danger here of misinterpreting the B-theory. While the\nB-theory doesn\u2019t posit temporal passage, it does posit\nsuccession. Relatedly, the traditional project of squaring our\ntemporal experience with the B-theory is about explaining away an\nillusion of temporal passage, not about explaining away an illusion of\ntemporal succession (see the SEP entry on the\n experience and perception of time).\n Since the B-theory posits succession (a B-relation), an experience of\nsuccession is non-illusory, on the B-theory. This makes trouble for\nLeftow\u2019s appeals to the B-theory. After all, Leftow holds that a\nQTE being\u2019s life, in which all times are experienced at once, is\nwhat a non-illusory experience of B-time would be like (Leftow 1991:\n122). In other words, the thought is that an experience of temporal\nsuccession is illusory, on the B-theory.\n\nLeftow also suggests that the sense in which QTE involves earlier and\nlater points is not a temporal one, but a logical one. However,\nlogical priority is not temporal priority, nor is it relevantly like\ntemporal priority (Rogers 1994: 11).\n\nA more recent idea is that of a typically temporal property (TTP). A\nproperty is a TTP if a term predicating it is \u201cpart of a\ndefinition of being temporal or figures appropriately in the right\nsort of nondefining sufficient condition for being temporal\u201d\n(Leftow 2002). The right sort is for example \u201cnecessarily,\nwhatever is past was temporal\u201d rather than \u201cnecessarily,\nwhatever is a pig is temporal\u201d. The thought is that just like\nbeing bipedal helps make us human without being sufficient for making\nus human, so, e.g., being present helps make things temporal without\nbeing sufficient for making things temporal (and so there can be an\ntimeless eternal present a la Boethius).\n4.2 Divine Temporality\n\nIn recent times, there has been a notable shift away from divine\ntimelessness. There are many different kinds of views that fall under\nthe heading of divine temporality; many of these could also be\nclassified as \u201cintermediate\u201d views. As in 4.1, the list is\nof course far from exhaustive.\n\nNote that while Open Theism has been part of the shift away from\ndivine timelessness, the position arises specifically in relation to\nthe topic of divine foreknowledge. Open Theism says that God does not\nknow which choices we will freely make in the future, because there is\nnothing yet to be known; here, free choice is understood along\nlibertarian lines and the future is taken to be genuinely open in some\nmetaphysically significant sense. For more on Open Theism, see\nPinnock et al. 1994, Zimmerman 2010, Rice 2020, Rissler (Other\nInternet Resources), and the SEP entry on\ndivine foreknowledge.\n\n4.2.1 Pure Temporalism\n\nOn this view, God is located at all times, God experiences succession,\nand God has lived through and will live through a non-finite past and\nfuture. The idea here is that God is in (our, physical)\ntime/spacetime, and God is a temporal being in just the way we are,\nexcept that the temporal extent of God\u2019s life is infinite.\nCompared to other temporal views, this one is conceptually\nstraightforward. Arguably, however, it is in tension with current\ncosmology, which suggests that the universe has a finite past. Insofar\nas the view implies that God is bound by, or has no power over time,\nit may also be at odds with some of the constraints arising from\nWestern Scripture (see\n section 2).\n The view is found at least in process theologians like Charles\nHartshorne (Hartshorne 1947).\n4.2.2 Relative Timelessness\n\nOn Alan Padgett\u2019s view, God changes, so God is temporal.\nHowever, timelessness is not abandoned; instead, it is redefined. \n\n\n[\u2026] I have not abandoned timelessness. Instead, I have\nredefined \u201cGod is timeless\u201d to mean that God is relatively\ntimeless, i.e. he is not measured by time nor is he affected by the\nnegative aspects of temporal passage. (Padgett 1992: 146; also 2001)\n\n\n\nThe idea is that God\u2019s time is non-identical with our,\n\u201cMeasured Time\u201d.\n\n\u201cMeasured Time\u201d is \u201cthe specifically human time of\nour history and our universe: the time of seconds, days, and\ncenturies; the time of our space-time\u201d (Padgett 1992: 130). In\nthat sense of \u201ctime\u201d, God is timeless. However, God is not\ntimeless in the strict sense in which \u201ctime\u201d refers to any\nkind of temporality, because God is in his own time. Does that mean\nGod is only in his time and not in ours? No, he is in our time too (p.\n131\u2014at least saying this is \u201cphilosophically\nacceptable\u201d (p. 126)), as we are in his. It\u2019s just that he\ntranscends our time. What does it mean to transcend our time? It means\nthat God is the ground of time, that he is not negatively affected by\nthe passage of time, and (things get a little circular here), that he\nis relatively timeless.\n\nOne question one might have about this is what \u201cMeasured\nTime\u201d and \u201cGod\u2019s time\u201d are, and how plausible\nit is to think there are both. Padgett maintains that in everyday\nspeech, \u201ctime\u201d refers \u201cnot to an ontological\ncategory\u201d but to \u201cthe human time of our history and our\nuniverse\u201d (1992: 130). The distinction is supported by appeals\nto the differences between this sense of \u201ctime\u201d and\n\u201cthe strict ontological sense of \u2018time\u2019 used in\nphilosophy\u201d (p. 140). But this may still leave one wondering\nabout the distinction. For one thing, few contemporary ontologists\ntake themselves to be investigating a time distinct from \u201cthe\nhuman time of our history and our universe\u201d. Nor do they tend to\nthink of the time of the universe as specifically human. For another,\nthere are a number of different philosophical views about time.\n4.2.3 Timeless Without and Temporal With Creation\n\nWilliam Lane Craig\u2019s view is that God is timeless without\ncreation, and temporal with creation (Craig 2000). God exists\ntimelessly \u201cwithout\u201d creation rather than before creation,\nbecause there isn\u2019t literally a before. And so it can\u2019t\nliterally be the case that God becomes temporal, since becoming\nanything involves being first one thing and then the other.\nNonetheless, God is \u201ctimeless without creation and temporal\nsubsequent to creation \u201d, God \u201centers time at the moment\nof creation\u201d (Craig 2000: 33). God exists changelessly and\ntimelessly, but by creating, God undergoes an extrinsic change\n\u201cwhich draws Him into time\u201d (Craig 2000: 29).\n\nThe problem is that even extrinsic change still presupposes a before\nand after (Leftow 2005: 66). Craig is aware of the difficulty: \n\n\n[O]n such a view, there seem to be two phases of God\u2019s life, a\ntimeless phase and a temporal phase, and the timeless phase seems to\nhave existed earlier than the temporal phase. But this is logically\nincoherent, since to stand in a relation of  earlier than  is by all\naccounts to be temporal. (Craig 2000: 32) \n\n\nHis solution is \n\n\nthat \u201cprior\u201d to creation there literally are no intervals\nof time [\u2026] no earlier and later, no enduring through\nsuccessive intervals and, hence, no waiting, no temporal becoming.\nThis state would pass away, not successively, but as a whole, at the\nmoment of creation, when time begins. \n\n\nAnd this state, he says, \u201clooks suspiciously like a state of\ntimelessness\u201d (Craig 2000: 33).\n\nBut this solution looks suspiciously like a re-statement of the view.\nThe problem was that we could only talk of a \u201cbefore\u201d in\nquotation marks. Yet we needed there to literally be such a before on\nthe view in question. (This is unless we decline to make literal sense\nof all this, but that is not Craig\u2019s approach.) What can it mean\nto say God underwent a change at the end of which God was temporal?\nCraig\u2019s answer seems to be that there is timelessness before\ntime\u2019s beginning, or rather, \u201cbefore\u201d time\u2019s\nbeginning.\n\nCraig endorses Padgett\u2019s distinction between \u201cMeasured\nTime\u201d and \u201cOntological Time\u201d (God\u2019s time).\nUnlike Padgett, he identifies the latter with Newton\u2019s absolute\ntime. He defends a \u201cneo-Lorentzian\u201d interpretation of\nspecial relativity, according to which there is a privileged reference\nframe that is in principle undetectable due to the effective Lorentz\ninvariance of the dynamical laws. In addition, he points to the cosmic\ntime of some general relativistic spacetime models as a candidate for\nabsolute time. Each of these claims is made in support of a strong\nprior commitment to the A-theory, shared with Padgett. However, each\nclaim faces problems, and their connection is unclear, since the\n\u201cneo-Lorentzian\u201d approach to special relativity\ndoesn\u2019t allow for as natural a development in the direction of\ngeneral relativity as does the standard approach (see, e.g., Balashov\n& Janssen 2003, W\u00fcthrich 2013).\n\nCraig and Padgett differ over whether cosmic time gives a\n\u201cproper measure\u201d of God\u2019s time, and thus effectively\nover whether, on this kind of view, we have any epistemic access to\nGod\u2019s time (which we are also in). Craig answers in the\naffirmative, but still hesitates to identify cosmic time with\nGod\u2019s time, preferring instead to say that the two\n\u201ccoincide\u201d (Craig 1990: 344).\n4.2.4 Metrically Amorphous Time\n\nRichard Swinburne originally defends timelessness (Swinburne 1965),\nbut then switches allegiance to a temporal view. According to his\nlater view, before creation God lives alone in a metrically amorphous\ntime (Swinburne 1977, 1993, 1994). (Padgett also describes God\u2019s\ntime as metrically amorphous.) Once God creates the world and\ninstitutes the laws of nature, time acquires a metric. There then\nbegin to be facts of the matter about how long temporal intervals\nare.\n\nFurther Reading: \n\nDefenses of Divine Timelessness: Helm 1988, 2001; Yates 1990;\nRogers 2000, 2007; Dolezal 2017; Duby 2022.\nDefenses of Divine Temporality: Lucas 1973, 1989; Wolterstorff\n1975, 2000a,b, 2001; Hasker 1989, 2002; Zimmerman 2002; DeWeese 2002,\n2004; Mullins 2016.\n\n5. Arguments against Divine Timelessness\n5.1 Arguments from Divine Omniscience and Tensed Facts\n\nRecall that the theistic God is omniscient. Presumably then, God knows\nwhat temporal reality is like at its most fundamental. If there are\nfundamental tensed facts (like that it\u2019s 12:00), God knows them.\nBut since these facts change, what God knows changes constantly. So\nGod changes constantly; so God is in time.\n\nArgument 1\n\n(1)\nGod is omniscient.\n(2)\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows the fundamental temporal\nfacts.\nSo (3)\nGod knows the fundamental temporal facts. (From (1), (2))\nSo (4)\nif there are fundamental tensed facts (i.e. the A-theory is true),\nthen God knows them. (From (3))\n(5)\nIf God knows fundamental tensed facts, then what God knows\nchanges.\n(6)\nIf what God knows changes, then God changes.\n(7)\nIf God changes, then God is temporal.\n\n\nTherefore, if the A-theory is true, then God is temporal. (From (4),\n(5), (6), (7))\n\n\nVarious versions of this argument have been defended (Craig 2000,\n2001; DeWeese 2004; Hasker 2002; Kretzmann 1966; Padgett 1992, 2001;\nWolterstorff 1975; Mullins 2016: Ch. 4). Since many participants of\nthe debate think the A-theory is true, it is treated as an argument\nfor divine temporality. In response, advocates of timelessness\nchallenge one or more of the argument\u2019s premises (Wierenga 1989,\n2002; Alston 1989a; Ganssle 1993, 1995, 2002). Others respond by giving up\non the A-theory and accepting the B-theory (Helm 1988, 2001; Rogers\n2000). The thought is that this argument can\u2019t be run for the\nB-theory, since on the B-theory, the fundamental (tenseless) temporal\nfacts don\u2019t change. The parallel argument would get stuck at the\nanalogue of step (5): it\u2019s not the case that if God knows\nfundamental tenseless facts, then what God knows changes. So while the\nargument itself is silent on whether the B-theory allows one to\ncombine timelessness with omniscience, part of the point of making it\nis that the parallel argument can\u2019t be run for the B-theory.\n\nOne might, however, wonder whether there are arguments in the vicinity\nof Argument 1 that can be run on the B-theory too. Consider first the\nfollowing, somewhat similar argument.\n\nArgument 2\n\n(1\u2032)\nGod is omniscient.\n(2\u2032)\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows what time it is.\nSo (3\u2032)\nGod knows what time it is. (From (1\u2032), (2\u2032))\n(4\u2032)\nWhat time it is changes.\nSo (5\u2032)\nWhat God knows changes. (From (3\u2032), (4\u2032))\n(6)\nIf what God knows changes, then God changes.\n(7)\nIf God changes, then God is temporal.\n\n\nTherefore, God is temporal. (From (5\u2032), (6), (7))\n\n\nUnlike in the case of Argument 1, the connection to the A-theory here\nis not straightforward. There is certainly a sense in which (4\u2032)\nis true on the B-theory, even though there is, on the B-theory, no\nchange in the fundamental temporal facts. At each time, that time is\npresent\u2014not in the absolute, metaphysically privileged sense of\nthe A-theory, but in a relative, perspectival sense. Each time is\npresent at itself, just like each spatial location is here relative to\nitself. Moreover, on a standard B-theoretic account of tensed language\n(e.g., Mozersky 2015; but see Torre 2010 for an alternative account),\nat each of those times, a temporal subject S can know, and have\na true belief about, what time it is. At noon, S believes that\nit is noon; that belief is made true by a tenseless fact, such as that\nS holds the belief at (a time simultaneous with) noon. At\n12:01, S believes truly that it is 12:01, where this belief is\nmade true by another tenseless fact, such as that this later belief is\nheld by S at (a time simultaneous with) 12:01, and so on.\n\nAdmittedly, it is not the case, on this B-theoretic account, that knowing\nwhat time it is (at different times) involves knowing different things\nat different times. The reason is that the tenseless contents that are\nbelieved can be believed by S at all times equally (and typically\nwill be). So while, at each time, S has a tensed belief with a\ntenseless content that differs from the tenseless content of\nS\u2019s tensed beliefs at previous times, S may not\ncome to believe, or know, anything new. This suggests that the same\napplies to God, and that (5\u2032) doesn\u2019t follow from\n(3\u2032) and (4\u2032).\n\nHowever, what matters is not just what S knows and\nbelieves, but how S knows and believes it. Tensed\nbeliefs have rather different cognitive significance from the\ncorresponding tenseless ones. What matters for timely action is\nbelieving the tenseless content via a tensed representation, by having\na true tensed belief (\u201cit is noon (now)\u201d). The point is a\nmore general one that applies equally to indexicals other than\n\u201cnow\u201d, such as \u201cI\u201d or \u201chere\u201d: the\ncognitive significance of indexical beliefs differs from that of the\ncorresponding non-indexical ones.\n\nTherefore, if a B-theoretic subject S knows (at more than one\ntime) what time it is, then they undergo changes. The reason is that\nhow they believe what they believe changes. They need to keep track of\ntheir temporal perspective by having appropriately varied tensed\nbeliefs (\u201cit\u2019s noon\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s\n12:01\u201d). At least this is so for anyone whose temporal nature\nrelevantly resembles our own. Does this group include God? If so, then\non the B-theory too, there is reason to worry about the combination of\nomniscience with timelessness.\n\nArgument 3\n\n(1\u2032)\nGod is omniscient.\n(2\u2032)\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows what time it is.\nSo (3\u2032)\nGod knows what time it is. (From (1\u2032), (2\u2032))\n(4\u2033)\nIf S knows what time it is, then how S believes\n(what S believes) changes.\n(5\u2033)\nHow God believes (what God believes) changes. (From (3\u2032),\n(4\u2033))\n(6\u2033)\nIf how God believes changes, then God changes.\n(7)\nIf God changes, then God is temporal.\n\n\nTherefore, God is temporal. (From (5\u2033), (6\u2033), (7))\n\n5.2 Arguments from Divine Action\n\nOne might reason as follows. When God creates the universe, God begins\nto stand in the relation of coexisting with to the universe,\nand also in the relation of sustaining it in existence.\nAcquiring these and other relations to the universe makes God\ntemporal, because it constitutes a change that God undergoes at the\nmoment of creation. Even if God was timeless before, God is temporal\nafter creation (Craig 2009).\n\nThe problem with this line of thought is again that it is not clear\nhow to understand the notions of before and after, of acquiring, and\nof beginning, as applied to a timeless God.\n\nHowever, the point can be made in another way. God is thought to be\ncausally active in the world, where those causal relations include\nGod\u2019s responding to petitionary prayer and being actively\ninvolved in world history. Similarly, God coexists with the world and\nsustains it in existence at every moment. God loves, and knows about\nthe lives of, God\u2019s creatures. All these are relations. God\nstands in causal and other relations to a temporal world.\nDoesn\u2019t this make God temporal (Mullins 2016, Ch. 5)?\n\nEach version of divine timelessness tries to address this concern in\nsome way. One somewhat radical response, given by Aquinas and others,\nis that while the world is related to God, God is not related to the\nworld.\n5.3 Arguments from Divine Personhood\n\nSuppose that whatever is a person does at least some of the following:\nremembering, anticipating, reflecting, deliberating, deciding,\nintending, and acting intentionally. If timelessness precludes one\nfrom doing any of these, then being timeless is incompatible with\nbeing a person. Since God is a person, God is not timeless.\n\nBut is it the case that being a person requires one to do at least\nsome of the above? Instead one might hold that at most, it requires\none to be capable of doing at least some of the above. And\nperhaps a timeless God is capable of doing some of the above, even if\nGod does not do them.\n\nAlternatively, one might question the grounds for thinking that these\nactivities tend to be precluded by timelessness. It is true that they\nall seem to involve change, namely a change in one\u2019s mental\nstates. But defenders of timelessness may think we should leave room\nin our conceptual scheme for a timeless, changeless version of each of\nthese activities (Craig 2009; Murray & Rea 2008: Ch. 2).\n6. Arguments for Divine Timelessness\n6.1 Arguments from Divine Perfection\n\nThere are a number of considerations speaking in favor of divine\ntimelessness that arise out of perfect being theology. Perfect being\ntheology is the approach to theology that involves figuring out what\nGod is like on the basis of God\u2019s being the most perfect (or\ngreatest possible) being. A general argument goes as follows. The most\nperfect being, God, has the most perfect mode of existence. But\ntemporal existence is a less perfect mode of existence than timeless\nexistence. Therefore, God has a timeless mode of existence.\n\nWhy think that temporal existence is less perfect than timeless\nexistence? Note that we\u2019re here mostly concerned with the second\nissue distinguished at the beginning of\n section 4,\n namely the nature of God\u2019s experience (rather than the first,\nnamely whether or not God is located in time/spacetime). The thought\nis that ordinary temporal experience involves gain and loss, and an\nawareness of the inescapable passage of time. Relatedly, for ordinary\ntemporal beings, neither the distant past nor the future are\nperceptually accessible. We remember parts of the past, but\nimperfectly, and we merely anticipate the future. We know much less\nabout the future than the past. We can\u2019t change or re-experience\nthe past, nor can we skip ahead to later moments, except one at a\ntime.\n\nBut then again, God is no ordinary temporal being. The defender of\ntemporality can reply that while God\u2019s life has temporal\nfeatures, in that God experiences succession, God\u2019s temporal\nexperience is otherwise very much unlike ours (Mullins 2014). For\nexample, God is omniscient, so God forgets no part of the past and\nalready knows all about the future. It\u2019s true that experiencing\nsuccession means experiencing things one at a time. But, the defender\nof temporality might add, this very feature is necessary for, e.g.,\nthe ability to enjoy music, which is good and therefore something the\nmost perfect being would have.\n\nThere are more indirect ways of arguing from perfection to\ntimelessness. For example, suppose that the most perfect mode of\nexistence involves immutability, and that immutability requires\ntimelessness. Or suppose that perfection requires divine simplicity,\nand that simplicity requires timelessness (for more, see the SEP\nentries on\n divine simplicity\n and\n immutability).\n6.2 Arguments from Divine Foreknowledge\n\nOne line of thought is that complete knowledge of future contingent\nevents is impossible for beings in time. Since God is omniscient, and\ntherefore knows all that will happen, God is timeless.\n\nAnother line of thought is that while God is omniscient, and therefore\nknows all that will happen, some of our actions are genuinely free.\nBut these two facts are in tension with one another, and the tension\ncan be resolved by thinking of God as timeless.\n\nHere is this line of thought in more detail. First consider an\nargument for theological fatalism, the view that divine foreknowledge\nand freedom are incompatible (Pike 1965; Murray & Rea 2008: Ch.\n2). God is omniscient. So God knows all that is true and believes\nnothing false. Now consider the proposition p that you will\nread this section 1,000 years hence. Suppose p was true 1,000\nyears ago. Then God believed p then. And you never had a choice\nabout whether God believed p 1,000 years ago. Nor have you ever\nhad a choice about anything that follows from God\u2019s believing\np 1,000 years ago, including that you read this section today.\nSo you never had a choice about whether you read this section today,\nwhich means you\u2019re not doing it freely.\n\nOne proposed solution is to deny that p was true 1,000 years\nago. (Aristotle responds in this way to a similar, non-theological\nargument for logical fatalism.) For more on this solution, see the SEP\nentries on\n foreknowledge and free will\n and\n fatalism.\n\nA defender of divine timelessness may attempt another solution\n(inspired by Boethius). God is not located in time, so God does not\nknow or believe things at times. So it is not the case that God\nbelieved p 1,000 years ago. Rather, all temporal events are\nbefore God\u2019s mind \u201cat once\u201d, or in an atemporal\npresent. However, some argue that a similar problem still arises\n(Zagzebski 1991: Ch. 2).\n6.3 Arguments from Relativity Theory\n\nGod is immaterial. Suppose it follows from this that God is not in\nspace. Then one might argue that relativity theory implies that God is\nnot in time either, because according to relativity theory, anything\nthat is in time is also in space (Leftow 1991: 272).\n\nWhile the basic thought is clear enough, one might worry about the\ndetails of this argument. In relativity theory, there are no such\nthings as times or spatial locations, at the fundamental level. So it\nwould be at least misleading to say that according to relativity\ntheory, anything that is located at times is located at spatial\nlocations. But a defender of the argument probably has in mind\nprecisely this implication of (special) relativity, that\nspatiotemporal regions are fundamental, because there is no unique\ndecomposition of spacetime into space at times. Presumably the lesson\nof relativity theory for the present debate can be suitably\nreformulated.\n Further Reading on God and Time: Pike 1970; Braine 1988; Yates\n1990; Gale 1991; Mawson 2008; Craig 1998, 2001, 2009; Murray & Rea\n2008; Leftow 2010; Tapp & Runggaldier 2011; Oppy 2014; Mullins\n2016; Melamed 2016; Deng 2019; Schm\u00fccker, Williams and Fischer\n2022; Moravec (forthcoming); and Ganssle (Other Internet\nResources). \n7. Other Debates about Eternity \n\nBoth timelessness or atemporality, and permanence or everlastingness,\nare widely applicable concepts. This section outlines a few non-religious\nphilosophical debates in which the concept of eternity, in the sense\nof atemporality, can play a role (McDaniel 2016).\n\nConsider questions about the nature of propositions, mathematical\nobjects, or other abstracta. Perhaps these are atemporal entities,\nexisting outside of time/spacetime, and not standing in any\nspatiotemporal relations to other entities. What sorts of\nconsiderations might bear on whether they are or not? Take\npropositions, the true or false things sentences express. Take a\nsentence that changes its truth-value over time (e.g.,\n\u201cIt\u2019s sunny\u201d). Does such a sentence express\ndifferent propositions at different times (that it\u2019s sunny at\n\\(t_1\\), that it\u2019s sunny at \\(t_2\\), etc.)? Or does it express\nthe same proposition over time (that it\u2019s sunny)? If it\u2019s\nthe former, then the propositions expressed don\u2019t themselves\nchange truth-value. If it\u2019s the latter, the proposition (that\nit\u2019s sunny) itself changes truth-value. In this latter case,\nthat might give one reason think that the proposition is located\nwithin time rather than outside of it. On the other hand, it might\nnot. After all, the truth-value also seems to vary with spatial\nlocation; yet we may be reluctant to infer from this that the\nproposition has spatial locations.\n\nAs another example, consider the view that time does not exist, for\nexample as argued for by speculative metaphysicians such as McTaggart\nor F. H. Bradley. On such views, everything is eternal (in the\nsense of atemporal).\n\nThe view that time is unreal was also argued for by Kurt G\u00f6del on\nthe basis of general relativistic considerations (G\u00f6del\n1949). G\u00f6del\u2019s starting point is his discovery of solutions\nto Einstein\u2019s Field Equations that permit the existence of\nclosed timelike curves. Such spacetimes, he argues, do not contain a\ntemporal dimension, since time only exists if there is genuine passage\nof time, and there cannot be genuine passage of time in such\nworlds. This in turn suggests that time does not pass, and thus does\nnot exist, in the actual world either (for more on the argument see\nSavitt 1994; Dorato 2002; Yourgrau 2005).\n\nMore recently, some physicists and philosophers of physics working on\napproaches to quantum gravity have entertained the view that spacetime\nmay not be fundamental (see the SEP entry on\n quantum gravity).\n Of course, whether the concept of atemporality applies in this\ncontext depends on how the claim that spacetime is not fundamental is\nbest understood.",
