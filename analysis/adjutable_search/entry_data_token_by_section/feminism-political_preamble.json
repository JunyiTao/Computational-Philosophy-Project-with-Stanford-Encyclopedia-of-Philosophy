    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry turns to how feminist philosophers have intervened in and,\nto a great extent, transformed the intellectual field known as\npolitical philosophy, which for millennia had largely ignored matters\nof sex and gender. Traditional political philosophy largely sidelined\nand excluded the private sphere and civil society from political\ntheorizing, the very realms in which women were largely sequestered.\nIt focused instead on matters of state and governance. The rise of\nliberalism since the seventeenth century abetted this tendency by\ndrawing a sharp line between the public and the private realms. What\nhappened in the household, it held, were not matters of political\nconcern. Today, thanks largely to feminist interventions, political\nphilosophy is a far richer field of philosophical inquiry. It\nunderstands power and governance much more broadly.\n\nIn its own right, feminist political philosophy is a branch of both\nfeminist philosophy and political philosophy. As a branch of feminist\nphilosophy, it serves as a form of critique or a hermeneutics of\nsuspicion (Ric\u0153ur 1970). That is, it serves as a way of opening\nup or looking at the political world as it is usually understood and\nuncovering ways in which women and their current and historical\nconcerns are poorly depicted, represented, and addressed. As a branch\nof political philosophy, feminist political philosophy serves as a\nfield for developing new ideals, practices, and justifications for how\npolitical institutions and practices should be organized and\nreconstructed. Indeed, the feminist refrain that \u201cthe personal\nis political\u201d speaks to the fact that feminist political\nphilosophy is not only concerned with concepts that have always been\nmainstays in political philosophy (e.g., justice, equality, freedom),\nbut with redefining and expanding what is considered\n\u201cpolitical\u201d in the first place (e.g., the family, the\nworkplace, reproduction; Hirschmann 2007). In this sense, feminist\npolitical philosophy may be the paradigmatic branch of feminist\nphilosophy.\n\nWhile feminist philosophy has been instrumental in critiquing and\nreconstructing many branches of philosophy, from aesthetics to\nphilosophy of science, feminist political philosophy is also\nparadigmatic because it best exemplifies the point of feminist theory,\nwhich is, to borrow a phrase from Marx, not only to understand the\nworld but to change it (Marx 1845). And, though other fields have\neffects that may change the world, feminist political philosophy\nfocuses most directly on understanding ways in which collective life\ncan be improved. This project involves understanding the ways in which\npower emerges and is used or misused in public life (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on power).\n As with other kinds of feminist theory, common themes have emerged\nfor discussion and critique, but there has been little in the way of\nconsensus among feminist theorists on what is the best way to\nunderstand them. This introductory article lays out the areas of\nconcern that have occupied this vibrant field of philosophy for the\npast forty years. It understands feminist philosophy broadly to\ninclude work conducted by feminist theorists doing this philosophical\nwork from other disciplines, especially political science but also\nanthropology, comparative literature, law, and other programs in the\nhumanities and social sciences.\n",
