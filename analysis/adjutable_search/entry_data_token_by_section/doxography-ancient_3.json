    "main_text": "Theophrastus and the Placita\n4. Theophrastus and the Placita\n\nTheophrastus applies the diaeretic method in his treatise De\nSensibus. The chief division\u2014already found in corresponding\npassages in Aristotle\u2014is between those who posit that knowledge\nis to be ascribed to similarity (\u2018like knows like\u2019) and\nthose who posit that it is to be ascribed to contrast (\u2018unlike\nknows unlike\u2019). Another division, not paralleled in Aristotle,\nalso plays an important part in classifying and dialectically\ndiscussing the tenets, viz. between those who assume that there is a\ndifference between thinking and sense-perception, and those who do\nnot. Finally, within each class the philosophers are treated in a\nsequence determined by the number of senses that are posited (category\nof quantity). The last philosopher to be discussed is Democritus, not\nPlato. This is because Democritus according to Theophrastus assumes\nthat knowledge comes about through both similarity and contrast.\n\nThis presentation, viz. a division, or divisions, of contrasting\ntenets (names included) dealing with specific issues, followed by an\nexceptional (or compromise) view, which fails to fit this division, is\nnot a standard feature of Aristotle\u2019s dialectical\noverviews. However we do find partial anticipations of this\nmethodology in Aristotle, e.g. in the second chapter of De\nAnima I he opposes three views concerned with the principles that\nconstitute the soul: some hold that these are corporeal, others that\nthey are incorporeal, while a third group posits a blend of corporeal\nand incorporeal principles. In Aristotle however we do not find the\nstrings of detailed sortings of individual tenets followed by a\ncompromise or maverick opinion typical of numerous Placita\nchapters, while Theophrastus\u2019 presentation in the De\nSensibus is in this respect close to the Placita\nroutine.\n [5]\n Consequently, we may submit that it is Aristotle\u2019s dialectical\nmethodology, as revised by Theophrastus, which determines the\nstructure of large sections of the Placita. It should be\nnoted, moreover, that the introduction of ps-Plutarch\u2019s\nPlacita, that \u2018according to Aristotle and Theophrastus\nand almost all the Peripatetics a perfect human being should devote\nhimself to problems in the fields of natural philosophy and\nethics\u2019.\n\nTheophrastus and Aristotle, then, were used in this way. An\nexample: The chapters in A\u00ebtius (Placita 3.9\u201315)\nand Cicero (Academics 2.122) dealing with a number of various\nand occasionally even bizarre views concerning the position, motion,\nshape, etc. of the earth in the last resort patently derive, as to\ntheir main themes and oppositions and even as to some telling details,\nfrom a chapter in Aristotle\u2019s On the Heavens (2.13)\n(Mansfeld 1992). Cicero here mentions Theophrastus by name; he\ntherefore may well be involved too, as an intermediary source. But we\nhave no further evidence concerning his contribution in this\nparticular instance.\n\nIt is rather amazing that the great Diels, who clearly was aware of\nthe importance of the diaeretic method in Aristotle\u2019s writings\nand in Theophrastus\u2019 De Sensibus, failed to apply this\ninsight to the Placita literature. The diaphonic\norganization, moreover, of chapters containing tenets that are listed\naccording to criteria determined by various divisions obviously\ndetermines not only the presentation but also, to some extent, the\ncontents of the material.\n\nIt would seem that, just as is the case for Aristotle, also in that of\nTheophrastus more than one treatise provided material that ultimately\nfound a home in the Placita, namely at the very least the\nPhysikai Doxai, the Physics, the De\nsensibus, and the Metarsiology.\n",
