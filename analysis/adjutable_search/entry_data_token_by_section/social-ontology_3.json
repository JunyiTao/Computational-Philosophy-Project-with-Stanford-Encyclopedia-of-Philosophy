    "main_text": "History || The Construction of Social Categories\n1.3 The Construction of Social Categories\n\nNineteenth-century social criticism reopened the question of the\nsources of social categories. Philosophers scrutinized commonplace\ncategories\u2014often ones that we employ in our daily\npractices\u2014revealing that they have darker (or at least richer)\nunderpinnings than we realize. Their approaches raise questions about\nthe motivations for using these categories, as well as their nature\nand metaphysical sources.\n\nIn a section of Capital titled \u201cThe Fetishism of\nCommodities and the Secret Thereof\u201d, Karl Marx argues that\ncertain social categories that might appear natural are in fact the\nproducts of social and economic relations among people (Marx 1867).\nSubsequent philosophers put claims of the constructedness of social\nentities at the center of social critique. Luk\u00e1cs 1923 argues\nthat capitalism extensively \u201creifies\u201d social\nentities\u2014that is, it turns phenomena that arise from an\noppressive economic system into features of the world that we regard\nas natural.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche employs a historical or \u201cgenealogical\u201d\nmethod in On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) to critique the basic\ncategories of Christian morality. Challenging the idea that this\nmorality is basic to human nature, he argues that prevailing moral\ncategories were tools intentionally wielded in a struggle for power.\nIdeals of humility and self-denial, for instance, were introduced by\nleaders of a resentful population to undermine the aristocratic values\nof Greco-Roman society. In Nietzsche\u2019s account, the sources of\nsuch categories are largely cognitive and intentional, as opposed to\narising from material relations, as they do in Marx\u2019s\naccount.\n\nMembers of the Frankfurt School, especially Theodor Adorno and Max\nHorkheimer, draw on Marx and Nietzsche to argue not just that the\nsocial world becomes \u201csecond nature\u201d to us, but that our\ncurrent social order is maintained, at least in part, by the causal\neffects of our treating social entities and categories as if they were\nnatural (Adorno & Horkheimer 1947, Adorno 1966). Uncovering social\ncategories becomes a centerpiece of subsequent social criticism. If\noppressive structures are to be dismantled, the social nature of the\neveryday world first needs to be revealed. The work of the Frankfurt\nSchool in particular is influential in contemporary feminist and race\ntheory (see\n section 5.4).\n",
