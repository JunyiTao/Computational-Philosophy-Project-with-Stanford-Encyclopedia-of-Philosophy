    "main_text": "Characteristics of Chinese Ethics: Practical Focus and Closeness to Pre-theoretical Experience\n1. Characteristics of Chinese Ethics: Practical Focus and Closeness to Pre-theoretical Experience\n\nIn the Analects 13.18, the Governor of She tells Confucius of\na Straight Body who reported his father to the authorities for\nstealing a sheep. Confucius (Kongzi, best known in the West under his\nlatinized name, lived in the 6th and 5th century\nB.C.E) replies that in his village, uprightness lies in fathers and\nsons covering up for each other. In the Euthyphro, Socrates\nencounters Euthyphro (whose name can be translated as \u201cStraight\nthinker\u201d), reputed for his religious knowledge and on his way to\nbring charges against his father for murder. The conversation between\nSocrates and Euthyphro leads to a theoretical inquiry in which various\nproposed answers as to piety\u2019s ousia (essence) are\nprobed and ultimately found unsatisfactory, but in which no answer to\nthe piety or impiety of Euthyphro\u2019s action is given. The\ncontrast between these two stories highlights one of the distinctive\nfeatures of Chinese ethics in general: its respect for the practical\nproblem. The practical problem discussed by Confucius and Socrates is\narguably a universal one: the conflict between loyalty owed to a\nfamily member and duty to uphold public justice within the larger\ncommunity. Confucius\u2019s response is one dimension of a\ncharacteristically Chinese respect for the practical problem. The\nnature of the problem demands a practical response. However, another\ndimension of a reflective respect for the practical problem\nis to maintain a certain humility in the face of a really hard\nproblem. It is to be skeptical that highly abstract theories will\nprovide a response that is true to the complexities of that problem. A\ntradition exemplifying such respect will contain influential works\nthat will not pretend to have resolved recurring tensions within the\nmoral life such as those identified in the Analects and the\nEuthyphro.\n\nConfucius gives an immediate practical answer in 13.18, but the reader\nand commentators have been left to weave together the various remarks\nabout filiality (or as it is often called, \u201cfilial piety\u201d)\nso as to present a rationale for that answer. These remarks quite\noften concern rather particular matters, as is the matter of turning\nin one\u2019s father for stealing a sheep, and the implications for\nmore general issues are ambiguous. Do fathers and sons cover up for\neach other on all occasions, no matter how serious, and if there is a\ncover-up, is there also an attempt to compensate the victim of the\nwrongdoing? The particularity of these passages is tied up with the\nemphasis on praxis. What is sought and what is discussed is often the\nanswer to a particular practical problem, and the resulting\nparticularity of the remarks invites multiple interpretations. The\nsayings often are presented as emerging from conversations between\nConfucius and his students or various personages with official\npositions, or among Confucius\u2019s students. One passage (11.22)\nportrays Confucius as having tailored his advice according to the\ncharacter of the particular student: he urges one student to ask\nfather and elder brother for advice before practicing something he has\nlearnt, while he urges the other to immediately practice; the reason\nis that the first has so much energy that he needs to be kept back,\nwhile the second is retiring and needs to be urged forward. With this\npassage in mind, we might then wonder whether the apparent tension\nbetween remarks made in connection with a concept is to be understood\nin terms of the differences between the individuals addressed or other\naspects of the conversational context. \n\nAll texts that have become canonical within a tradition, of course,\nare subject to multiple interpretations, but Chinese texts invite\nthem. They invite them by articulating themes that stay relatively\nclose to the pre-theoretical experience that gives rise to the\npractical problems of moral life (see Kupperman 1999 on the role of\nexperience in Chinese philosophy). The pre-theoretical is not\nexperience that is a pure given or unconceptualized, nor is it\nnecessarily experience that is universal in its significance and\nintelligibility across different traditions of thought and culture.\nThis attention to pre-theoretical experience also leads to differences\nin format and discursive form: dialogues and stories are more suited\nfor appealing to and evoking the kind of pre-theoretical experience\nthat inspires parts of the text. By contrast, much Western philosophy\nhas gone with Plato in taking the route of increasing abstraction from\npre-theoretical experience.\n\nThe contrast is not meant to imply that Chinese philosophy fails to\ngive rise to theoretical reflection. Theoretical reflection of great\nsignificance arises in the Mozi, Mencius,\nHanfeizi, Xunzi, and Zhuangzi, but there is\nmore frequent interplay between the theorizing and references to\npre-theoretical experience. In Chinese texts there are suggestions for\ntheorizing about this experience, but the suggestions often indicate\nseveral different and fruitful directions for theorizing to go\nfurther. These directions may seem incompatible, and they may or may\nnot be so in the end, but the tensions between these directions are\nreal. The result is a fruitful ambiguity that poses a\nproblematic. Pre-theoretical experience poses a practical\nproblem. Apparently incompatible solutions to problems are partially\ntheorized in the text, but the apparent incompatibility is not\nremoved. Much of the value of these texts lies in their leaving the\ntensions in place with enough theory given to stimulate thinking\nwithin a certain broadly defined approach. There is more than enough\nfor the sophisticated theorist to try to interpret or to reconstruct a\nmore defined position as an extension of that broadly defined\napproach. At the same time, the problematic is partly framed with the\nlanguage of pre-theoretical experience in the form of dialogue and\nstory, making the texts accessible to a much broader range of readers\nthan is usually the case with philosophy texts. The following sections\npresent some of the major kinds of problematic that appear in the\nmajor schools of Chinese ethical thought.\n",
