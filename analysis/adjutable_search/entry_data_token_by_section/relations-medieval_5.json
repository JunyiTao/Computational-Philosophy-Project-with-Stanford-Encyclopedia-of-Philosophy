    "main_text": "Relations in Medieval Philosophy || Anti-Realism about Relations\n3.2 Anti-Realism about Relations\n\n\nThe rejection of polyadic properties might seem to commit one to a\nform of anti-realism about relations\u2014that is, to the view that\nrelations exist only in the mind. This was, in fact, the position of\nPeter Auriol. If there are no polyadic properties or\n\u2018intervals\u2019, he assumes, then there is nothing in\nextramental reality to correspond to our relational concepts. But in\nthat case, he says, \u201ca relation cannot be posited except in\napprehension\n alone\u201d.[12]\n\n\nGiven the current state of medieval research, it is difficult to know\nhow widespread this (or any other) form of anti-realism was during the\nMiddle Ages. Shortly after Auriol\u2019s death, certain aspects of\nhis anti-realism appear to have met with considerable success. Ockham\nand his followers, for example, accept Auriol\u2019s view that\nrelations exist only in the mind as concepts or beings of reason\n(entia rationis), though unlike Auriol, as we shall see, they\nthink this is compatible with saying that things are related\nindependently of the activity of the mind. And we can find echoes of\nthe same sort of view in the writings of early modern\n philosophers.[13]\n\n\nPrior to the fourteenth century, however, it is difficult to identify\nany unambiguous representatives of anti-realism, at least in the Latin\nWest. Albert the Great claims to find something akin to Auriol\u2019s\nargument in the writings of Alfarabi (d. 950) and Avicenna (d. 1037),\nbut he does not say whether either of these figures actually endorses\nit or merely presents it for consideration (See Liber de\npraedicamentis, 222b-223a).\n Again, Aquinas suggests that a similar view can be found in the\nwritings of Gilbert of Poitiers and his followers, the so-called\nPorretani, but his suggestion is controversial, and in any case\nAquinas reports that Gilbert later retracted the view in the face of\ntheological controversy (Cf.  Summa Theologiae I, q. 28,\na. 2, corpus; cf. also Veckley 1965, 28\u20139). Unless further research\nalters the current picture, therefore, it would appear that, although\nanti-realism may have had something of a foothold in the Arabic\nspeaking world, most notably among the members of a group of orthodox\nMuslim theologians known as the Mutakallim\u016bn, in its more radical\nforms it was always a minority position in the Latin\n West.[14]\n",
