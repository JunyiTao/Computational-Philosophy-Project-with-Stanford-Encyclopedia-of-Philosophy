    "main_text": "\n\nWhile Petrus Ramus (1515\u20131572) undoubtedly occupies an important\nplace in the history of ideas, few nowadays would consider him to be\none of the most significant philosophers of his time. Yet in his day\nhe gained an impressive number of followers and admirers, and his\nworks influenced the curriculum of many European universities.\nAccording to scholars such as Walter J. Ong, Ramus\u2019 frequently\nreprinted books on logic \u201ccould in no real sense be considered\nan advance or even a reform\u201d (Ong 1958: 5). Yet, it was mainly\non the basis of these books that he acquired an impressive reputation\nin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\n\nWe must look at Ramus as a typical phenomenon of the sixteenth century\nand its unceasing religious controversies. It was also a period of\nstate building, during which Italian humanism was transformed into its\nNorthern European counterpart. Ramus himself took part in this\nprocess. A Huguenot convert from Catholicism, he was one of the most\nfamous victims of the St. Bartholomew\u2019s day massacre. From early\nyouth he fought against scholasticism and its interpretation of\nAristotle; and he tried to reform the contemporary university\ncurriculum in a way that would fulfill the new needs of the emerging\nstates. As a good humanist, he approached everything linguistically\nand rhetorically.\n\nThe extent to which he was, in reality, an offspring of the scholastic\ntradition has yet to be recognized. Although he attracted many ardent\nsupporters, a little scholastic anti-scholasticism was the main reason why\nhis revolt against traditional philosophy did not produce an entirely\nnew philosophical system. Ramus soon came to be considered, not an\ninnovative thinker, but an outmoded one.\n To gain a true picture of Petrus Ramus and his work, it is\nnecessary to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the enthusiasm\nof his admirers and hagiographical biographers and, on the other, the\nscholars who, from a philosophical or a scholastic perspective, have\ncriticized his lack of originality and consistency. Even among modern\nscholars there are different opinions of the significance or\nconsistency of his work. It is impossible to describe Ramus\u2019\nthinking and to understand his importance without considering all\nsides of the story. He may never have intended to achieve what\nposterity has blamed him for not achieving.  Instead modern historians\nhave emphasized the huge impact his pedagogical ideas had for almost a\ncentury.\n",
