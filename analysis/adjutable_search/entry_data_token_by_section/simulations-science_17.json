    "main_text": "Emergence\n8. Fictions\n Models of course involve idealizations. But it has been argued\nthat some kinds of idealization, which play an especially prominent\nrole in the kinds of modeling involved in computer simulation, are\nspecial\u2014to the point that they deserve the title of\n\u201cfiction.\u201d This section will discuss attempts to define\nfictions and explore their role in computer simulation.\n\n\nThere are two different lines of thinking about the role of fictions\nin science. According to one, all models are fictions. This line of\nthinking is motivated by considering the role, for example, of\n\u201cthe ideal pendulum\u201d in science. Scientists, it is argued,\noften make claims about these sorts of entities (e.g., \u201cthe\nideal pendulum has a period proportional to the square-root of its\nlength\u201d) but they are nowhere to be found in the real world;\nhence they must be fictional entities. This line of argument about\nfictional entities in science does not connect up in any special way\nwith computer simulation\u2014readers interested in this topic should\nconsult the entry on\n scientific representation\n [forthcoming].\n\n\nAnother line of thinking about fictions is concerned with the question\nof what sorts of representations in science ought to be regarded as\nfictional. Here, the concern is not so much about the ontology of\nscientific model entities, but about the representational character of\nvarious postulated model entities. Here, Winsberg (2009c) has argued\nthat fictions do have a special connection to computer simulations. Or\nrather, that some computer simulations contain elements that best\ntypify what we might call fictional representations in science, even\nif those representations are not uniquely present in simulations. \n\n\nHe notes that the first conception of a fiction\u2014mentioned\nabove\u2014which makes \u201cany representation that contradicts\nreality a fiction\u201d (p. 179), doesn\u2019t correspond to our ordinary\nuse of the term: a rough map is not fiction. He then proposes an\nalternative definition: nonfiction is offered as a \u201cgood\nenough\u201d guide to some part of the world (p. 181); fiction is\nnot. But the definition needs to be refined.  Take the fable of the\ngrasshopper and the ant. Although the fable offers lessons about how\nthe world is, it is still fiction because it is \u201ca useful guide\nto the way the world is in some general sense\u201d rather than a\nspecific guide to the way a part of the world is, its \u201cprima\nfacie representational target\u201d, a singing grasshopper and\ntoiling ant. Nonfictions, on the other hand, \u201cpoint to a certain\npart of the world\u201d and are a guide to that part of the world\n(p. 181).\n\n\nThese kinds of fictional components of models are\nparadigmatically exemplified in certain computer simulations. Two of\nhis examples are the \u201csilogen atom\u201d and \u201cartificial\nviscosity.\u201d Silogen atoms appear in certain nanomechanical models\nof cracks in silicon\u2014a species of the kind of multiscale models\nthat blend quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics mentioned in\nsection 2.3. The silogen containing models of crack propagation in\nsilicon work by describing the crack itself using quantum mechanics and\nthe region immediately surrounding the crack using classical molecular\ndynamics. To bring together the modeling frameworks in the two regions,\nthe boundary gets treated as if it contains \u2018silogen\u2019\natoms, which have a mixture of the properties of silicon and those of\nhydrogen. Silogen atoms are fictions. They are not offered as even a\n\u2018good enough\u2019 description of the atoms at the\nboundary\u2014their prima facie representational targets. But they are\nused so that the overall model can be hoped to get things right. Thus\nthe overall model is not a fiction, but one of its components is.\nArtificial viscosity is a similar sort of example. Fluids with abrupt\nshocks are difficult to model on a computational grid because the\nabrupt shock hides inside a single grid cell, and cannot be resolved by\nsuch an algorithm. Artificial viscosity is a technique that pretends\nthat the fluid is highly viscous\u2014a fiction\u2014right were the\nshock is, so that he shock becomes less abrupt, and blurs over several\ngrid cells. Getting the viscosity, and hence the thickness of the\nshock, wrong, helps to get the overall model to work \u201cwell\nenough.\u201d Again, the overall model of the fluid is not a fiction,\nit is a reliable enough guide to the behavior of the fluid. But the\ncomponent called artificial viscosity is a fiction\u2014it is not\nbeing used to reliably model the shock. It is being incorporated into a\nlarger modeling framework so as to make that larger framework,\n\u201creliable enough.\u201d\n\n\nThis account has drawn two sorts of criticisms. Toon (2010) has\nargued that this definition of a fiction is too narrow. He gives\nexamples of historical fictions like I, Claudius, and\nSchindler\u2019s Ark, which he argues are fictions, despite\nthe fact that \u201cthey are offered as \u2018good enough\u2019\nguides to those people, places and events in certain respects and we\nare entitled to take them as such.\u201d (p. 286\u20137). Toon, presumably,\nsupports a broader conception of the role of fictions in science, then,\naccording to which they do not play a particularly prominent or\nheightened role in computer simulation.\n\n\nGordon Purves (forthcoming) argues that there are examples of\nfictions in computational models (his example is so-called\n\u201cimaginary cracks\u201d), and elsewhere, that do not meet the\nstrict requirements discussed above. Unlike Toon, however, he also\nwants to delineate fictional modeling elements from the non-fictional\nones. His principal criticism is of the criterion of fictionhood in\nterms of social norms of use\u2014and Purves argues that we ought to\nbe able to settle whether or not some piece of modeling is a fiction in\nthe absence of such norms. Thus, he wants to find an intrinsic\ncharacterization of a scientific fiction. His proposal takes as\nconstitutive of model fictions that they fail to have the\ncharacteristic that Laymon (1985) called \u201cpiecewise\nimprovability\u201d (PI). PI is a characteristic of many models that\nare idealizations; it says that as you de-idealize, your model becomes\nmore and more accurate. But as you de-idealize a silogen atom, you do\nnot get a more and more accurate simulation of a silicon crack. But\nPurves takes this failure of PI to be constitutive of a fiction, rather\nthan merely symptomatic of them.\n",
