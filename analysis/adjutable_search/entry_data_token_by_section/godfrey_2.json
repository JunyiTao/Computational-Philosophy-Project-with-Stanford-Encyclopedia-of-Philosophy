    "main_text": "Division of Being\n3. Division of Being\n\n\nIn opposition to Henry of Ghent\u2019s division of real being into\nessential being (esse essentiae) and existential being\n(esse existentiae), in Quodlibet VIII, q. 3 Godfrey proposes\nhis own division. Being (esse) may be divided into being in\nthe mind (\u201ccognitive\u201d being) which is a lesser or diminished being, and\nreal being, i.e., being outside the mind or knower. Real being is\nsubdivided into real being in potency and real being in act. A thing\npossesses real being in potency insofar as it has being by reason of\nits cause or causes. It has real being in act insofar as it is realized\nin its own nature in completed or perfected form. A thing may have real\nbeing in potency either by reason of its intrinsic cause (e.g., if\nmatter preexists which may enter into the thing\u2019s constitution), or by\nreason of an extrinsic cause (e.g., if an agent preexists which can\nproduce it). Godfrey illustrates this with the example of a rose that\ndoes not yet actually exist. Prior to the creation of the world and\nhence of matter it possessed real being in potency only by reason of\nGod, its extrinsic cause. After creation it possessed real being in\npotency by reason of preexisting matter as well, an intrinsic cause.\nAnd now it may also possess real potential being by reason of some\ncreated extrinsic cause (or causes). Both before and after the world\u2019s\ncreation it enjoys cognitive being insofar as it was and is known by\nthe divine mind (PB 4.38\u201340; Wippel, 1981, 15\u201317).\n",
