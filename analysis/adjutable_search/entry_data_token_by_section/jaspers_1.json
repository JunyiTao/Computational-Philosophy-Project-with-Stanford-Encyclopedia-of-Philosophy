    "main_text": "Career\n2. Career\n\nJaspers received an extremely diverse and broad-ranging education. He\ninitially enrolled as a student of law at the University of Heidelberg\nfor three semesters (1901\u20131902). Despite his already vivid interest in\nphilosophy, which he explored through Spinoza\u2019s Ethics\n(1677) and Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason\n(1781),  he decided for medicine was based on his belief that\nit best illuminated life itself and the challenges of human existence.\nJaspers began his medicine studies in Berlin (1902/1903), then moved\nto Gottingen (1903\u20131906), and eventually finished them in Heidelberg\n(1906\u20131908). He submitted his dissertation, Heimweh und\nVerbrechen in 1908 and graduated M.D. in 1909. He was a research\nassistant in the psychiatric clinic of the university of Heidelberg\nfrom 1909\u20131915, where he worked with some of the most famous\npsychiatrists in Germany, including Nissl, Wilmanned, Gruhle, and\nMayer-Gross. Due to his illness with bronchiectasis, he was incapable\nof carrying out heavy duties in the clinic. The director of the\npsychiatric clinic of the university of Heidelberg, Franz Nissl,\npermitted him to spend the majority of his time at the library rather\nthan in the clinic and the laboratory. Indeed, his extraordinary\nskills of critical thinking and abstract observation on human\nsituations were evident already then. From 1913 onward, Jaspers read\nphilosophy systematically. In 1913 he published his Allgemeine\nPsychopathologie (General Psychopathology) which already\nmade apparent the viewpoints and methods that belong to the world of\nthe humanities and social studies that were regarded by him as\nconverging into psychopathology. In the same year, he obtained his\nsecond doctorate (Habilitation) in psychology from the\nPhilosophy Faculty at the University of Heidelberg, supervised by\nWilhelm Windelband. He was a lecturer and later an Associate Professor\nof Psychology (Privatdozent) from 1913 to 1921. During this\nperiod, in 1919, he published his Psychologie der\nWeltanschauungen (Psychology of World Views). This work\nis considered as a transitional work, in which his psychological\nmethod was clearly shaped by philosophical influences and objectives,\nand was already evolving into a consistent philosophical doctrine and\nacquiring some of the main issues that were to be explored later\nwithin his philosophy of existence. Then, in 1922, he took over the\nfull professorial chair of philosophy in the University of Heidelberg\n(after Heinrich Maier), a position from which he was dismissed in 1937\nby the Nazis. To a large extent, the two first major publications were\nworks of psychology that contain many elements, albeit in inchoate\nform, of his later philosophy. Following his nomination as professor,\nhe wrote nothing for ten years, except for two small works\u2014a\npatholography Stirnberg and van Gogh in 1922 and Die Idee\nder Universit\u00e4t (The Idea of the University) in 1923.\n\nWhile he was working as a psychiatrist in Heidelberg, Jaspers came\ninto contact with Max Weber, and also with the other intellectuals who\nwere grouped around Weber, including Ernst Bloch, Emil Lask, Georg\nSimmel, and Luk\u00e1cs. His intellectual formation was marked in a\nnumber of ways by this intellectual milieu. At a political level, he\nintegrated aspects of Weber\u2019s enthusiasm for heroic liberalism,\nresponsible nationalism and elite democracy into his own thought and\nattitudes. At a more theoretical level, his ideas were determined by\nthe increasingly critical responses to neo-Kantian philosophy, which\ndominated methodological discussions around Weber and Luk\u00e1cs,\nand which subsequently coloured the intellectual horizon during World\nWar I and throughout the Weimar Republic. This period witnessed the\ndethroning of neo-Kantianism as the philosophical orthodoxy in the\nGerman academic establishment, and it was marked by a proliferation of\nphilosophical models which rejected Kantian formalism and sought to\nintegrate experiential, historical and even sociological elements into\nphilosophical discourse. The attempt to rescue Kantian philosophy from\nthe legalistic formalism of the South West German School of\nneo-Kantian philosophy, centred around Heinrich Rickert and Wilhelm\nWindelband, became one of the central features of Jaspers\u2019s\nwork, and in many ways his entire philosophical evolution was\nmotivated by the desire to reconstruct Kantian thought, not as a\nformalist doctrine of self-legislation, but as an account of\nmetaphysical experience, spontaneously decisive freedom, and authentic\ninner life. His early career as professor of philosophy was also\ndeeply (and adversely) affected by neo-Kantian hostility to his work.\nIndeed, both neo-Kantians and phenomenological philosophers subjected\nhis work to trenchant criticism in the early stages of his\nphilosophical trajectory, and members of both these camps, especially\nRickert and Edmund Husserl, accused him of importing anthropological\nand experiential questions into philosophy and thus of contaminating\nphilosophical analysis with contents properly pertaining to other\ndisciplines.\n\nIf Weber was the first decisive personal influence and Kant was the\nfirst decisive philosophical influence on Jaspers, in the early 1920s\nhe encountered a further figure who assumed a decisive role in his\nformation: that is, Martin Heidegger. It cannot be claimed without\nqualification that Heidegger directly determined the conceptual\nstructure or underlying preconditions of Jaspers\u2019s work, nor\nthat Heidegger assimilated aspects of Jaspers\u2019s thought into his\nown philosophy. Throughout their theoretical trajectories, the\ndifferences between Heidegger and Jaspers were in many ways greater\nthan the similarities. Indeed, the theoretical controversies between\nthem eventually culminated in an embittered personal and political\naltercation, caused by Heidegger\u2019s publicly declared sympathy\nfor the National Socialists in 1933. Jaspers felt himself personally\nthreatened by Heidegger\u2019s infamous decision to support the\nNazis, as he was married to a Jewish woman, and he had previously\nattached himself to eminent liberal politicians and philosophers, most\nnotably Weber, who were now vilified by Heidegger and other\nintellectuals attached to the NSDAP. In 1933, Jaspers himself was\nbriefly tempted into making certain incautiously optimistic statements\nabout the Hitler regime. Indeed, these were remarks were not entirely\nout of keeping with his other publications of the early 1930s. In the\nlast years of the Weimar Republic he published a controversial\npolitical work, Die geistige Situation der Zeit (The\nSpiritual Condition of the Age, 1931), which\u2014to his later\nacute embarrassment\u2014contained a carefully worded critique of\nparliamentary democracy. Throughout this period, he also stressed the\nrelevance of Weberian ideas of strong leadership for the preservation\nof political order in Germany. The souring of his relations with\nHeidegger, however, seems to have hardened his mind into a strict and\nsustained opposition to National Socialism, and, unlike Heidegger, his\nworks of the 1930s avoided political themes and were largely\nconcentrated on elaborating the interior or religious aspects of his\nphilosophy. In 1932, he published his trilogy Philosophie,\nconsisting of three separate volumes, each based on its own object of\ntranscending: Weltorientierung (Orientation of the World),\nExistenzerhellung (Illumination of Existence) and\nMetaphysik (Metaphysics). This book is generally considered\nas his magnum opus and he testified in retrospect that is was\nthe closest work to his heart. The choice not to grant the book the\nexpected title of \u201cExistential Philosophy\u201d, despite the\nextensive use of the term Existenzphilosophie, reflects his\ndiscontent about its narrowing his guiding ideal of Philosophia\nPerennis. Later in his Vernunft und Widervernunft in unserer\nZeit (Reason and Anti-Reason in Our Time), from 1950 he would\nexpress his preference for the expression \u2018philosophy of\nreason\u2019.\n\nDespite the at times envenomed relations between them, however,\nHeidegger and Jaspers are usually associated with each other as the\ntwo founding fathers of existential philosophy in Germany. This\ninterpretation of their philosophical status and relationship is at\nleast questionable. Heidegger resented being described as an\nexistentialist, and Jaspers, at least after 1933, resented being\nidentified with Heidegger. Even during their early friendship\nHeidegger was very critical of Jaspers\u2019s philosophy; he wrote a\ncommentary on Psychology of World Views, in which he claimed\nthat Jaspers\u2019s methodological approach remained ensnared in the\nfalsehoods of subjectivist metaphysics and Cartesian ontology, and\nthat it illegitimately introduced the categories of Weberian sociology\ninto philosophical analysis. Similarly, throughout his life Jaspers\nkept a book of critical notes on Heidegger, and he routinely described\nHeidegger\u2019s fundamental ontology in a tone of moral-humanistic\ndisapprobation. Nonetheless, there remains a residue of validity in\nthe common association of Heidegger and Jaspers, and, although it\nrequires qualification, this association is not in every respect\nmisleading. Existentialism was, and remains, a highly diffuse\ntheoretical movement, and it cannot be expected that two philosophers\nconnected with this movement should hold similar views in all\nrespects. However, existentialism had certain unifying features, and\nmany of these were common to both Jaspers and Heidegger. In the early\nstages of its evolution, therefore, existentialism might be described\nas a theoretical stance which: a) moved philosophical discourse away\nfrom Kantian formalism and emphasized the belief that the content of\nthought must reside in particular experiences and decisions; b)\nfollowed Kierkegaard in defining philosophy as a passionate and deeply\nengaged activity, in which the integrity and the authenticity of the\nhuman being are decisively implicated; c) sought to overcome the\nantinomies (reason/experience; theory/praxis; transcendence/immanence;\npure reason/practical reason) which determine the classical\nmetaphysical tradition by incorporating all aspects (cognitive,\npractical and sensory) of human life in an encompassing account of\nrational and experiential existence. If this definition of\nexistentialism is accepted, then the suggestion of a family connection\nbetween Jaspers and Heidegger cannot be entirely repudiated, for both\ncontributed to the reorganization of philosophical questioning in the\n1920s in a manner which conforms to this definition. Ultimately,\nhowever, relations between Heidegger and Jaspers degenerated to a\nterminal impasse, and after World War II Jaspers refused to explain or\nexonerate Heidegger\u2019s political actions during the Nazi years\nand he even recommended to a de-Nazification committee that Heidegger\nshould be suspended from his university teaching responsibilities.\n\nDuring the Nazi period from 1933 onwards, Jaspers was excluded from\nany co-operation in the administration of the university until he was\ndismissed from his chair as a professor in 1937 and was subject to a\npublication ban (Publikationsverbot). During the war, he and\nhis wife were in no physical danger. Yet he felt himself a marked man\nuntil the end of World War II. Jaspers once heard indirectly that\nthere was a plan to deport him and his wife to a concentration camp in\nthe middle of April 1945. Fortunately, the American troops arrived in\nHeidelberg two weeks earlier, on April 1st 1945. However,\nafter 1945, his fortunes changed dramatically, and he figured\nprominently on the White List of the US-American occupying forces:\nthat is, on the list of politicians and intellectuals who were deemed\nuntarnished by any association with the NSDAP, and who were allowed to\nplay a public role in the process of German political re-foundation.\nFrom this time on Jaspers defined himself primarily as a popular\nphilosopher and educator. In the first role, he contributed extensive\nedifying commentaries on questions of political orientation and civic\nmorality\u2014first, in the interim state of 1945\u20131949, and\nthen, after 1949, in the early years of the Federal Republic of\nGermany. In the second role, as one of the professors responsible for\nreopening the University of Heidelberg, to which he was appointed by\nthe American Army of Occupation as a contemporary rector, he wrote at\nlength on the necessity of university reforms, he emphasized the role\nof liberal humanistic education as a means of disseminating democratic\nideas throughout Germany, and he took a firm line against the\nrehabilitation of professors with a history of Nazi affiliation. In\n1946, The Idea of the University was published in an\nessentially different form from the book with the same title from\n1923. The later work presents the university as a free community of\nscholars and students engaged in the task of seeking truth. As such,\nthe university and the scholars that populate it can and should play a\ndecisive role in rehabilitation of Europe based on the noblest ideas\nof the enlightenment. At that time and still, Jaspers is one of few\nwho can justly speak for value and the need for such a stance against\nthe threats upon freedom and humanity. The acknowledgment of\nJaspers\u2019s noble humanism in the first years after the war is\napparent in the numerous honors granted to him, including the Goethe\nPrize in 1947, the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1958, the\nErasmus Prize in 1959, and the Prize of the Foundation of Oldenburg\nfor Honorary Citizens.\n\nOf his post-1945 publications, therefore, Jaspers\u2019s political\ncontributions are perhaps the most significant. His contribution to\nthe promotion of a democratic civic culture in West Germany at this\ntime was of great importance, and his writings and radio broadcasts\nshaped, in part, the gradually evolving democratic consensus of the\nearly Federal Republic. In Die Schuldfrage (The Question\nof German Guilt, 1946), published at the time of the\nN\u00fcrnberg trials, he argued that, although not all Germans could\nbe legitimately brought to trial for war crimes, all Germans should\naccept an implicit complicity in the holocaust and only the critical\nself-reflection of all Germans could lead to cultural and political\nrenewal. In the 1950s, he supported the main policies of the\nliberal-conservative governments led by Konrad Adenauer\n(1949\u20131963), and he particularly endorsed the formation of the\nWestern Alliance, which he saw as a means of protecting the cultural\nresources of Western European culture from their colonization by the\nSoviet Union. Throughout this time, however, the cautiously\nconservative tenor of Jaspers\u2019s political thought was\nprogressively modified by his frequent and at times intense\nintellectual exchanges with Hannah Arendt, who might well be seen as\nthe fourth great influence on his work. Jaspers had been\nArendt\u2019s tutor and supervisor before she emigrated from Germany\nin the 1930s, but the period after 1945 saw something of a role\nreversal in this relationship, which Jaspers seems to have accepted\nquite graciously. Influenced by Arendt\u2019s agonistic\nrepublicanism, he gradually turned against the relatively complacent\nspirit of political and intellectual restoration in the early Federal\nRepublic, and he finally devoted himself to elaborating models of\ncitizenship founded in constitutional rights and legally enshrined\nidentities. In this respect, he can be viewed as an important\nprecursor of J\u00fcrgen Habermas, and his works contain an early\nconception of the doctrine later known as constitutional\npatriotism. His views on German re-unification were also\nparticularly influential; he opposed the dominant outlooks of the time\nby claiming that the demand for re-unification meant that German\npolitics remained infected with the damaging traces of old\ngeo-political ideas and ambitions, and it prevented the fundamental\nredirection of German political life. Finally, then, in symbolic\ndemonstration of disgust at the persistence of pernicious political\nattitudes in Germany he relinquished his German citizenship, and,\nhaving earlier moved across the border to University of Basel in 1948,\nhe became a Swiss national. In his last works, he placed himself\ncloser to the political left, and he even argued that only a legal\nrevolution could ensure that the German state was organized on the\nbasis of a morally decisive constitution. He died of a stroke in\nBasel, Switzerland on February 26 1969 at the age of 86. His wife,\nGertrud Jaspers, who served as his amanuensis throughout his entire\nlife as a scholar, died in Basel on May 25 1974 at the age of 95.\n",
