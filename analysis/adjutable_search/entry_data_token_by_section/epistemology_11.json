    "main_text": "What is Justification? || Deontological and Non-Deontological Justification\n3.1 Deontological and Non-Deontological Justification\n\nHow is the term \u201cjustification\u201d used in ordinary language?\nHere is an example: Tom asked Martha a question, and Martha responded\nwith a lie. Was she justified in lying? Jane thinks she was, for\nTom\u2019s question was an inappropriate one, the answer to which was\nnone of Tom\u2019s business. What might Jane mean when she thinks\nthat Martha was justified in responding with a lie? A natural answer\nis this: She means that Martha was under no obligation to\nrefrain from lying. Due to the inappropriateness of Tom\u2019s\nquestion, it wasn\u2019t Martha\u2019s duty to tell the\ntruth. This understanding of justification, commonly labeled\ndeontological, may be defined as follows: S is\njustified in doing x if and only if S is not obliged to\nrefrain from doing\n x.[22]\n\nIf, when we apply the word justification not to actions but to\nbeliefs, we mean something analogous, then the following holds:\n\n\nDeontological Justification (DJ)\n\nS is justified in believing that p if and only if\nS is not obliged to refrain from believing that\n p.[23]\n\n\nWhat kind of obligations are relevant when we wish to assess whether a\nbelief, rather than an action, is justified or unjustified?\nWhereas when we evaluate an action, we are interested in assessing the\naction from either a moral or a prudential point of view, when it\ncomes to beliefs, what matters may be something\n else,[24]\n e.g., the pursuit of truth, or of understanding, or\nof knowledge.\n\nExactly what, though, must we do in the pursuit of some such\ndistinctively epistemic aim? According to one answer, the one favored\nby evidentialists, we ought to believe in accord with our\n evidence.[25]\n For this answer to be helpful, we need an account of what our\nevidence consists of, and what it means to believe in accord with it.\nOther philosophers might deny this evidentialist answer, but still say\nthat the pursuit of the distinctively epistemic aims entails that we\nought to follow the correct epistemic norms. If this answer is going\nto help us figure out what obligations the distinctively epistemic\naims impose on us, we need to be given an account of what the correct\nepistemic norms\n are.][26]\n\nThe deontological understanding of the concept of justification is\ncommon to the way philosophers such as Descartes, Locke, Moore and\nChisholm have thought about justification. Recently, however, two\nchief objections have been raised against conceiving of justification\ndeontologically. First, it has been argued that DJ presupposes that we\ncan have a sufficiently high degree of control over our beliefs. But\nbeliefs\u2014this objection alleges\u2014are akin not to actions but\nrather things such as digestive processes, sneezes, or involuntary\nblinkings of the eye. The idea is that beliefs simply arise in or\nhappen to us. Therefore, beliefs are not suitable for deontological\nevaluation (see Alston 1985 & 1988; also, see Chrisman 2008). To\nthis objection, some advocates of DJ have replied that lack of control\nover our beliefs is no obstacle to thinking of justification as a\ndeontological status (see R. Feldman 2001a). Other advocates of DJ\nhave argued that we enjoy no less control over our beliefs than we do\nover our intentional actions (see Ryan 2003; Sosa 2015; Steup 2000,\n2008, 2012, 2017; and Rinard 2019b).\n\nAccording to the second objection to DJ, deontological justification\ncannot suffice for an agent to have a justified belief. This claim is\ntypically supported by describing cases involving either a benighted,\nculturally isolated society or subjects who are cognitively deficient.\nSuch cases involve subjects whose cognitive limitations make it the\ncase that they are under no obligation to refrain from believing as\nthey do, but whose limitations nonetheless render them incapable of\nforming justified beliefs (for a response to this objection, see Steup\n1999).\n\nThose who reject DJ think of justification not deontologically, but\nrather as a property that that a belief has when it is, in some sense,\nsufficiently likely to be\n true.[27]\n We may, then, define justification as follows:\n\n\nSufficient Likelihood Justification (SLJ)\n\nS is justified in believing that p if and only if\nS believes that p in a way that makes it sufficiently\nlikely that her belief is true.\n\n\nIf we wish to pin down exactly what the likelihood at issue amounts\nto, we will have to deal with a variety of tricky\n issues.[28]\n For now, let us just focus on the main point. Those who prefer SLJ to\nDJ would say that sufficient likelihood of truth and deontological\njustification can diverge: it\u2019s possible for a belief to be\ndeontologically justified without being sufficiently likely to be\ntrue. This is just what cases involving benighted cultures or\ncognitively deficient subjects are designed to show (for elaboration\non the non-deontological concept of justification, see Alston\n1988).\n",
