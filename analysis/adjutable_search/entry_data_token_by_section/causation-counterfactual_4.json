Lewis\u2019s 2000 Theory\n\nIn an attempt to deal with the various problems facing his 1973\ntheory, Lewis developed a new version of the counterfactual theory,\nwhich he first presented in his Whitehead Lectures at Harvard\nUniversity in March 1999. (A shortened version of the lectures\nappeared as his 2000. The full lectures are published as his\n2004a.)\n\nCounterfactuals play a central role in the new theory, as in the old.\nBut the counterfactuals it employs do not simply state dependences of\nwhether one event occurs on whether another event\noccurs. The counterfactuals state dependences of whether,\nwhen, and how one event occurs on whether,\nwhen, and how another event occurs. A key idea in the\nformulation of these counterfactuals is that of an alteration\nof an event. This is an actualised or unactualised event that occurs\nat a slightly different time or in a slightly different manner from\nthe given event. An alteration is, by definition, a very fragile event\nthat could not occur at a different time, or in a different manner\nwithout being a different event. Lewis intends the terminology to be\nneutral on the issue of whether an alteration of an event is a version\nof the same event or a numerically different event.\n\nThe central notion of the new theory is that of influence:\n\n(6)\nWhere c and e are distinct events, c\ninfluences e if and only if there is a substantial\nrange c1, c2, \u2026 of different not-too-distant\nalterations of c (including the actual alteration of\nc) and there is a range e1, e2, \u2026 of\nalterations of e, at least some of which differ, such that if\nc1 had occurred, e1 would have occurred, and if\nc2 had occurred, e2 would have occurred, and so on.\n\nWhere one event influences another, there is a pattern of\ncounterfactual dependence of whether, when, and how upon whether,\nwhen, and how. As before, causation is defined as an ancestral\nrelation:\n\n(7)\nc causes e if and only if there is a\n    chain of stepwise influence from c to e.\n\nOne of the points Lewis advances in favour of this new theory is that\nit handles cases of late as well as early preemption. (The theory is\nrestricted to deterministic causation and so does not address the\nexample of probabilistic preemption described below in\n \u00a75.4.)\n Reconsider, for instance, the example of late preemption involving\nBilly and Suzy throwing rocks at a bottle. The theory is supposed to\nexplain why Suzy\u2019s throw, and not Billy\u2019s throw, is the\ncause of the shattering of the bottle. If we take an alteration in\nwhich Suzy\u2019s throw is slightly different (the rock is lighter,\nor she throws sooner), while holding fixed Billy\u2019s throw, we\nfind that the shattering is different too. But if we make similar\nalterations to Billy\u2019s throw while holding Suzy\u2019s throw\nfixed, we find that the shattering is unchanged.\n\nAnother point in favour of the new theory is that it handles cases of\n\u2018trumping\u2019 preemption, first described by Jonathan\nSchaffer (2000a). Lewis gives an example involving a major and a\nsergeant who are shouting orders at the soldiers. The major and\nsergeant simultaneously shout \u2018Advance!\u2019; the soldiers\nhear them both and advance. Since the soldiers obey the superior\nofficer, they advance because the major orders them to, not because\nthe sergeant does. So the major\u2019s command preempts or trumps the\nsergeant\u2019s. Other theories have difficulty with trumping cases,\nincluding \u2013 or so Lewis believes \u2013 his own attempt to\nsolve the late preemption problem by appealing to quasi-dependence\n(2000, 184-5). The trumping case is one in which the causal chain\nleading from the sergeant\u2019s shout to the soldiers\u2019\nadvancing runs to completion \u2013 or at least, Lewis thinks, it is\nepistemically possible that it does \u2013 just as the chain leading\nfrom the major\u2019s shouting does. So it is an intrinsic duplicate\nof the comparison case where the sergeant shouts but the major\ndoesn\u2019t; hence the soldiers\u2019 advancing quasi-depends on\nthe sergeant\u2019s shout, which is the wrong result. Lewis\u2019s\nargues that his new theory handles trumping cases with ease. Altering\nthe major\u2019s command while holding fixed the sergeant\u2019s,\nthe soldier\u2019s response would be correspondingly altered. In\ncontrast, altering the sergeant\u2019s command, while holding fixed\nthe major\u2019s, would make no difference at all.\n\nThere is, however, some reason for scepticism about whether the new\ntheory handles the examples of late preemption and trumping completely\nsatisfactorily. In the example of late preemption, Billy\u2019s throw\nhas some degree of influence on the shattering of the bottle. For if\nBilly had thrown his rock earlier (so that it preceded Suzy\u2019s\nthrow) and in a different manner, the bottle would have shattered\nearlier and in a different manner. Likewise, the sergeant\u2019s\ncommand has some degree of influence on the soldiers\u2019 advance in\nthat if the sergeant had shouted earlier than the major with a\ndifferent command, the soldiers would have obeyed his order. In\nresponse to these points, Lewis must say that these alterations of the\nevents are too distant to be considered relevant. But some metric of\ndistance in alterations is required, since it seems that similar\nalterations of Suzy\u2019s throw and the major\u2019s command are\nrelevant to their having causal influence.\n\nIt has also been argued that the new theory generates a great number\nof spurious cases of causation (Collins 2000; Kvart 2001). The theory\nimplies that any event that influences another event to a certain\ndegree counts as one of its causes. But common sense is more\ndiscriminating about causes. To take an example of Jonathan Bennett\n(1987): rain in December delays a forest fire; if there had been no\nDecember rain, the forest would have caught fire in January rather\nthan when it actually did in February. The rain influences the fire\nwith respect to its timing, location, rapidity, and so forth. But\ncommon sense denies that the rain was a cause of the fire,\nthough it allows that it is a cause of the delay in the fire.\nSimilarly, in the example of the poison victim discussed above, the\nvictim\u2019s ingesting poison on a full stomach influences the time\nand manner of his death (making it a slow and painful death), but\ncommon sense refuses to countenance his eating dinner as a cause of\nhis death, though it may countenance it as a cause of its\nbeing a slow and painful death. Pace Lewis, common sense\ndoes not take just anything that affects the time and manner of an\nevent to be a cause of the event simpliciter.\n",
