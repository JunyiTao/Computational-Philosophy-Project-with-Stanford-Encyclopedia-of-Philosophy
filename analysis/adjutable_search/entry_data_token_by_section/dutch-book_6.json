    "main_text": "The Dutch Book Argument and Probabilistic Consistency || Coherence as a Pragmatic Consistency Constraint\n2.3 Coherence as a Pragmatic Consistency Constraint\n\nThe depragmatized DBAs attempt to use the Dutch Book theorem to show\nthat incoherent degrees of belief involve a kind of inconsistency on\ntheir own, irrespective of the way in which they link up with\nparticular preferences. But the claim of inconsistency here requires\nthat credences be tied to evaluations of fairness, which in turn\ninvokes a concept of valuation that goes beyond merely having degrees\nof belief. If an agent\u2019s degrees of belief are incoherent, and\nhe makes evaluations of bets using the standard expectation rule, then\nthere will be bets (with payoffs in some measure of utility) such that\ncalculated individually these will have expected value zero, and will\nin this sense be fair by his lights, but which lead to a net loss, and\nso may be said to be unfair. The unfairness can be deduced from the\nagent\u2019s beliefs and their connection with the agent\u2019s\nutilities, which establishes the defect brought out by the Dutch Book\nas internal to the agent, marking a crucial difference between the\nloss so inflicted and the sort requiring superior factual knowledge on\nthe part of the bookie. While the linkage between the agent\u2019s\ncredences and his evaluation of bets is crucial to this result, the\nneeded connection is independent of the agent\u2019s particular\npreference for goods, and so it could be said that the failure to\ncorrespond to fair betting quotients is a property of the\nagent\u2019s beliefs, as tied to evaluations of acts, yielding the\nresult that incoherent credences, appropriately connected with\npreference, display a property that is analogous to inconsistency for\nfull belief.\n\nThere is then a version of the DBA that seems close to what Ramsey had\nin mind, which claims that insofar as degrees of belief link up\nsuitably with preferences, incoherence is associated with a property\nmirroring inconsistency, although this still need not amount to\ndivided-mind inconsistency in Armendt\u2019s sense, nor is it\nentirely akin to inconsistency for full beliefs, which are\ncharacterized directly without any assumed connection to preference\nand action. The agent by whose lights each of a set of bets looks fair\n(or favorable), that is, should be evaluated as fair (or\nfavorable) although they lead collectively to a Dutch Book, which can\nbe set up by examining simply the agent\u2019s credences, has a\nsystem of evaluation that is self-defeating, and as such may be said\nto exhibit a form of irrationality. On this reading, the vulnerability\nassociated with incoherence is theoretical, and linked closely with\nthe agent\u2019s utilities, which means that actual vulnerability\ndepends not only upon an appropriately situated bookie, but also upon\nthe availability of suitable commodities that measure those utilities.\nWith this in place, bets can be fixed that constitute a book on the\nbasis of the agent\u2019s credences, but which are fair (or\nfavorable) by the agent\u2019s lights.  Notice that the\nprevious points, that an agent might avoid book by refusing to bet and\nthat one might end up on the side of a sure gain, are now otiose, for\nhere it is the agent\u2019s evaluations, rather than their\nconsequences that are implicated by the Dutch Book.  Still, the\nDBA depends upon the theory of preference and utility, and as Kaplan\nnotes (Kaplan 1996), this does not emerge straightforwardly from\nstandard presentations of the argument of the sort considered in\nsection one, nor in the depragmatized versions, as observed in the\nprevious section.  \n\nThe assumptions of the DBA are significant. It is the agent\u2019s\nsystem of credences together with the way they are involved in\nevaluating options that is implicated by the Dutch Book. To conclude\nthat simply having incoherent credences is irrational, a further\nargument is needed showing that rationality demands that credences be\nlinked to evaluations of bets as in the DBA, but there is little to\nsuggest that graded degrees of belief must be so connected. Indeed,\nthe DBA assumes not only that there is some connection between an\nagent\u2019s credences and the evaluation of options, but that one\nshould evaluate a bet as fair if it has an expected value of zero,\nusing one\u2019s credences with the standard expectation rule. This\nbuilds in that an agent\u2019s credences are related such that for\neach \\(H\\), \n\n\\[ \\cr(\\text{not }H) = 1 - \\cr(H). \\]\n\n\nHedden calls attention to this assumption, which he terms Negation\nCoherence, noting that it follows from the claim that credences\nsatisfy finite additivity and normalization (Hedden 2013). The premise\nof the DBA that connects credences with fair betting quotients thus\npresupposes a significant part of the probabilist\u2019s claim.\n \n\nEven assuming the appropriate kind of connection between credences and\nevaluations of options, it may be objected still that the sort of\ninconsistency revealed through the Dutch Book vulnerability involved\nin violating the probability axioms is not necessarily\nirrational, particularly in cases where this is due to the failure to\ngrasp some subtle or complex logical or other\nnecessary truths. It is hard to see that rationality requires\nagents to attempt to remove such inconsistencies in their belief\nsystems; indeed for most it would be both hopeless and\ncounterproductive. Nor does it seem correct to count as more rational\nthe person who avoids inconsistency, by refusing to have an opinion in\nthe face of evidence, than the person with less than full confidence\nin a logical truth, who takes the incomplete evidence into account.\nOne option is to insist that coherence is a requirement on ideal\nagents. It might be suggested instead that coherence is one of a\nnumber of ideals, whose satisfaction may sometimes conflict, and that\nan incoherent agent may still be rational in the sense that they have\noptimally managed their opinions in light of the totality of their\ngoals and constraints. Whatever the conclusion about the irrationality\nof being incoherent though, with idealizing assumptions about the\nconnection between degrees of belief and the evaluation of options,\nthe DBA succeeds in establishing incoherence as an evaluative defect.\n \n\nThere\nremain some disputes about how to understand the DBA for probabilism,\nand whether it provides an appropriate defense for the claim.  As\ndiscussed, some take the DBA to show that the probability axioms are a\ncondition of consistency for action guiding degrees of belief, where\nhaving incoherent credences involves faulty evaluations of\noptions.  It is sometimes added that incoherence thus indicates a\nform of epistemic irrationality.  Although incoherence may be\nheld to depart from a certain ideal of rationality in this way, it\nneed not mean that it is, all things considered, irrational to violate\nthe probability axioms, as noted by Huttegger (2013).  On this\nunderstanding, the claim that violating the probability axioms is a\nform of irrationality proceeds from the claim of inconsistency. \n\n\nOthers\nwho accept the idea that the problem with Dutch Book vulnerability is\nnot that it leads to bad consequences, but that it signals an internal\ndefect in the agent\u2019s credences, simply say that DBAs that meet\ncertain conditions, including being constructible by a bookie without\nrequiring more than knowledge of the agent\u2019s credences,\nestablish that the credences leading to a Dutch Book under these\nconditions display a form of irrationality, without suggesting that\nDutch Book vulnerability is form of inconsistency. Both ways of\nunderstanding DBAs have been carried over to arguments in support of\nadditional probabilistic norms.\n\n\nTaking\nthe view that Dutch Book vulnerability indicates a form of\ninconsistency has the advantage that it makes clear the sort of\nirrationality involved in cases of Dutch Book vulnerability, and\navoids the implausible claim that rationality always requires avoiding\nDutch Book vulnerability.  However, the view faces a difficulty\nin that the Dutch Book vulnerability for those who violate other\nproposed norms of probability seems less clearly a matter of\ninconsistency, as will be suggested in the following sections. \nThose who understand DBAs as proceeding directly from Dutch Book\nvulnerability to the claim of irrationality, without the intermediate\nconclusion that Dutch Books indicate inconsistency, must qualify what\nis to count as Dutch Book vulnerability and the sort of irrationality\nthat is at stake.  Pettigrew (2020) suggests that the relevant\nsort of Dutch Book vulnerability is a sure loss in every world that is\nepistemically possible for the agent, and that the conclusion to draw\nfrom this is that someone who is so vulnerable is epistemically\nirrational. Insofar as it is epistemic rationality that is of concern,\nthis formulation has the virtue of not counting the person who could\nbe made to lose money in every metaphysically possible world, on the\nbasis of having less than full confidence in some metaphysical truths,\nas subject to a proper Dutch Book and so irrational.  But, this\nstill leaves questions about what is to count as epistemically\nrational, and how in general this lines up with Dutch Book\nvulnerability.  Questions remain too about whether the pragmatic\nbasis of the Dutch Book argument offers appropriate grounds for\ndefending probabilistic norms of epistemic rationality, and this has\nspurred interest in alternative nonpragmatic justifications of such\nnorms.
