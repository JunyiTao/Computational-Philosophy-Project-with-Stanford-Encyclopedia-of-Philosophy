Moral Motivation and Metaethics\n\nPhilosophical thinking about the phenomenon of moral motivation has\nlong overlapped with and influenced ongoing efforts to address\nfoundational questions in ethics. Of special importance has been the\nuse of ideas concerning the nature of moral motivation to support\nanti-realism in ethics\u2014the view that contrary to the\nclaims of moral realists, there are no moral facts, no truths about\nwhat morality requires, forbids, or permits, except, perhaps, in some\nminimalist sense. We have already seen one example of how ideas about\nmoral motivation might bear on broader metaethical views in\nMackie\u2019s critique of ethical objectivism. As noted earlier,\nMackie defends cognitivist anti-realism, a form of\nanti-realism that couples cognitivism with an error theory. According\nto cognitivist anti-realism, although ethical sentences express\npropositions about objectively prescriptive properties\u2014ones with\n\u201cto-be-pursuedness\u201d built in\u2014no such properties\nexist; and due to this presupposition failure, we are systematically\nin error in our moral judgments.\n\nThe development of metaethical theories over roughly the past eighty\nsome years has perhaps been shaped most profoundly by the use of\ncertain theses about moral motivation to support noncognitivist\nanti-realism. Noncognitivist anti-realism, like\ncognitivist anti-realism, rejects the existence of robust moral\nproperties and moral facts. But unlike the latter view, it rejects\ncognitivism in favor of noncognitivism, which as\ntraditionally depicted is the view that moral judgments express\nattitudes rather than beliefs or propositions, and that, consequently,\nthey are not truth\n evaluable.[11]\n\nShafer-Landau (2003) offers a formulation of what he calls the\nNon-cognitivist Argument, which helpfully makes explicit how\ntheses that have figured in efforts to understand moral motivation\nhave been employed to support noncognitivist anti-realism:\n\nNecessarily, if one sincerely judges an action right, then one is\nmotivated to some extent to act in accordance with that judgment.\n(Motivational Judgment Internalism)\nWhen taken by themselves, beliefs neither motivate nor generate\nany motivationally efficacious states. (Motivational\nHumeanism)\nTherefore, moral judgments are not beliefs. (Moral\n Non-cognitivism)[12]\n\n\nSince moral realism incorporates the cognitivist claim that moral\njudgments are beliefs, the conclusion of the Non-cognitivist Argument\nentails that moral realism is false.\n\nContemporary philosophers who have sought to defend versions of moral\nrealism or objectivism have had to come to grips with this basic line\nof argument, even if they have not always engaged with it explicitly.\nThe Non-cognitivist Argument therefore provides us with a useful tool\nfor mapping out competing positions in metaethics. We can categorize\nphilosophers\u2019 positions negatively in terms of which premises of\nthe noncognitivist argument they accept or\n reject.[13]\n Some have rejected premise 1, often going on to defend forms of\nnaturalist moral realism that embrace externalism (e.g.\nRailton 1986; Boyd 1988; Brink 1989). According to the latter views,\nmoral properties are a kind of natural property and moral facts are\nnatural facts. Judgments about these facts express propositions, and\nso they can be true or false, but these judgment do not necessarily\nmotivate. Whether our moral judgments motivate us is fixed by\ncontingent facts about our psychologies and our substantive moral\nbeliefs. Some have rejected premise 2 (McDowell 1978, 1979), and some\nof those who have rejected premise 2 have aligned themselves with\nversions of moral constructivism or rationalism (e.g. Darwall 1983;\nScanlon 1998). The latter views take widely varying forms, but they\ngenerally see moral principles as requirements of rationality or\nreason, or as the output of a hypothetical agreement among reasonable,\nsuitably situated persons. Moral reasons are considerations that are\nmotivating, at least when we properly reflect on them, but their\nmotivating force does not depend on a prior desire. Some have rejected\nboth premises 1 and 2, defending forms of nonnaturalist moral\nrealism (Shafer-Landau 2003). Moral properties, on this view, are\nnot identical with natural or descriptive properties, although they\nmay be wholly constituted by them. Moral judgments are intrinsically\nmotivating\u2014they can motivate in the absence of a preexisting\ndesire, but they are not necessarily motivating. Finally, some have\naccepted both premises 1 and 2, at least appropriately refined,\narguing that we can see them both to be compatible with moral\ncognitivism, and further, with moral realism (Smith 1994). For\nexample, Smith understands the subject matter of judgments about right\naction as being normative reasons for action. According to him,\nnormative reasons are given by facts about what we would, suitably\nidealized, want ourselves to desire; and the existence of such facts\nmeans that some desires are rationally required. If we believe\nourselves to have a normative reason to \u03c6, then rationally we\nought to \u03c6, and in judging that we have normative reason to \u03c6,\nwe will necessarily, insofar as we are rational, be moved to \u03c6.\nThe concept of rightness is the concept of what we would, were we\nfully rational, desire ourselves to desire in our actual world. When\nwe believe it would be right to \u03c6, then, we will, insofar as we\nare rational, be motivated to \u03c6.\n\nMore recently, some (e.g. Tresan 2006, 2009a, 2009b) have argued that\nwhen understood as what Bjorklund et al. (2012) call\n\u201cnon-constitutional,\u201d motivational judgment internalism is\ncompatible not only with Smithian rationalism, but with a wide variety\nof cognitivist metaethical theories. \u201cNon-constitutional\ninternalism\u201d (or what Tresan calls \u201cSM internalism\u201d)\nis the view that according to our concept of a moral belief, a mental\nstate counts as a moral belief only if it is accompanied by\nmotivation. Necessarily, if p is a moral belief, then p is accompanied\nby motivation. According to Tresan, once we recognize this form of\ninternalism, we see that it is compatible with almost any version of\ncognitivism, and so with a range of metaethical views, including forms\nof ethical naturalism (2006: 68). This contrasts with attempts to\ncombine internalism and cognitivism on the grounds that the nature of\nmoral belief is such as to guarantee motivation (at least under\ncertain conditions) either because of the content of moral beliefs\n(Smith 1994) or because moral beliefs are themselves intrinsically\nmotivating states (Dancy 1993).
