About these rules of a positive legal system, Aquinas says\nthat, though they certainly should be, and be presumed to have been,\n\u201cderived from natural law\u201d, they have their legal\nforce only from their part in this posited system (ex\nsola lege humana vigorem habent: ST I-II, q. 95\na. 3).\n\n\nHis explanation, slightly updated: this very large part of our law\ncould reasonably have been different, in the way that every detail of\na maternity hospital could have been somewhat different and large\nportions of the design could have been very different, even though\nsome features (e.g., that the doors and ceilings are more than two feet\nhigh) are entailed by the commission to build a town maternity\nhospital, and every feature has some rational connection with\nthe commission. The kind of rational connection that holds even where\nthe architect has wide freedom to choose amongst indefinitely many\nalternatives is called by Aquinas a determinatio of\nprinciple(s)\u2014a kind of concretization of the general, a\nparticularization yoking the rational necessity of the principle with\na freedom (of the law-maker) to choose between alternative\nconcretizations, a freedom which includes even elements of (in a\nbenign sense) arbitrariness.\n\n\nOnce the determinatio is validly made, fulfilling the\ncriteria of validity provided by or under the relevant legal system\u2019s\nconstitutional law, it changes the pre-existing state of the law by\nintroducing a new or amended legal rule and proposition(s) of law. The\nnew or amended legal rule gives judges, other officials, and citizens\na new or amended reason for action (or forbearance). The fact that the\nnew or amended rule depends upon the social-fact source constituted or\nemployed by the act of determinatio does not entail that a\nnormative reason (an \u201cought\u201d) is being illogically derived\nfrom a bare fact (an \u201cis\u201d). Rather, the new or amended\nrule is normative, directive and (where that is its legal meaning )\nobligatory because that social fact can be the second premise\nin a practical syllogism whose first premise is normative:\n\u201cthere ought to be a maternity hospital in this town,\u201d\n\u201cpeople ought to be protected against homicidal assault,\u201d\n\u201cpeople ought to be required to contribute to the public\nexpenses of appropriate governmental functions\u201d, \u201cvictims\nof assault, theft, broken contracts, negligence, etc., ought to be\ncompensated,\u201d \u201croad traffic should be regulated to reduce\ndamaging collisions,\u201d and so forth. The moral normativity of the\nprinciple is replicated in the more specified rule created by the\ndeterminatio, even though the latter is not an entailment of\nthe former. \n\n\nThat is to say: the concretized rule is (morally as well as legally)\nnormative because such normativity is (presumptively and defeasibly)\nentailed by the (moral) principle that the common good (whose\nfundamental content is given by the foundational principles of\npractical reason: 1.1) requires that authoritative institutions take\naction to specify, apply and enforce some rules on the relevant\nmatters. Social facts make a positive legal rule a reason for action\nbecause the desirability of authority as a means of securing common\ngood, and the desirability of the \u201crule of law and not of\nmen,\u201d are standing and potent reasons for acknowledging such\nfacts as an instance of valid legislation giving presumptively\nsufficient reason for compliance. Purely positive law that is legally\nvalid is (presumptively and defeasibly) valid and binding \nmorally\u2014has the moral form or meaning of legal \nobligatoriness\u2014when and because it takes its place in a scheme of practical\nreasoning whose proximate starting point is the moral need for justice\nand peace, and whose more foundational starting-point is the range of\nbasic ways in which human wellbeing can be promoted and protected, the\nway picked out in practical reason\u2019s first principles.\n\n\nThus, in relation to the settled positive law, natural law\ntheory\u2014as is acknowledged by a number of legal positivists,\n(e.g., Raz 1980, 213; Gardner 2001, 227)\u2014shares the principal\nthesis of contemporary legal positivists, that laws depend for their\nexistence and validity on social facts.\n1.5.1 \u201cPresumptive\u201d and \u201cdefeasible\u201d obligatoriness\n\n\nThe legal-moral obligation or obligatoriness of a legal rule is\ncounterpart to the legal-moral authority or authoritativeness of its\nauthor (enacter) or other source. The idea of authority has been\nclarified by contemporary legal theorists such as Raz and Hart, by\nreflection upon the kind of reasons for action purportedly given to\npotentially acting subjects by an exercise of practical authority. The\nrelevant kind of practical reason has been variously called\nexclusionary, peremptory or pre-emptive, and content-independent. The\ncore idea is that subjects are instructed to treat the proffered\nreason (say, a statutory provision, or a judicial order), in their\ndeliberations towards choice and action, as a reason which does not\nsimply add to the reasons they already have for acting one way rather\nanother, but rather excludes and takes the place of some of those\nreasons. And this exclusionary, peremptory or pre-emptive force is\nowed not to the inherent attractiveness to reason of the (content of\nthe) proffered reason, but to the status of its author or other source\nas one entitled\u2014for example, by its role in a constitutional\nscheme of governance for the solution of a political community\u2019s\ncoordination problems\u2014to be obeyed, complied with, treated as\nauthoritative. See e.g., Raz 1986, 35\u201369. This\ncontent-independence of authoritative reasons entails their\npresumptive obligatoriness. The defeasibility of that presumption is\nentailed by the dependence of such reasons\u2019 peremptory, pre-emptive or\nexclusionary force upon a background of presupposed basic human needs\nand goods, and of basic moral principles and norms, a background which\nentails that if a purportedly authoritative proffered (posited) reason\nconflicts sufficiently clearly with those standing needs, goods,\nprinciples or norms its exclusionary force is exhausted or overcome\nand the purported obligatoriness defeated.\n\n\nLess abstractly put, both the effectiveness of laws as solutions to\ncoordination problems and promoters of common good, and the fairness\nof demanding adherence to them, are dependent upon their being treated\nboth by the subjects and the administrators of the legal system as\nlegally and morally entitled, precisely as validly made law, to\nprevail against all other reasons save competing moral\nobligations of greater strength. It is this entitlement that is\nnegated by the serious injustice of a law or legal system: see 3 and 4\nbelow.\n",
