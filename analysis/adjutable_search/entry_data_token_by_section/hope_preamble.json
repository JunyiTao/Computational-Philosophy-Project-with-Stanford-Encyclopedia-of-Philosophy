    "main_text": "\n\nDiscussions of hope can be found throughout the history of philosophy\nand across all Western philosophical traditions, even though\nphilosophy has traditionally not paid the same attention to hope as it\nhas to attitudes like belief and desire. However, even though hope has\nhistorically only rarely been discussed systematically\u2014with\nimportant exceptions, such as Aquinas, Bloch and Marcel\u2014almost\nall major philosophers acknowledge that hope plays an important role\nin regard to human motivation, religious belief or politics.\nHistorically, discussions of the importance of hope were often\nembedded in particular philosophical projects. More recent discussions\nof hope provide independent accounts of its nature and its relation to\nother mental phenomena, such as desire, intention and optimism.\n",
