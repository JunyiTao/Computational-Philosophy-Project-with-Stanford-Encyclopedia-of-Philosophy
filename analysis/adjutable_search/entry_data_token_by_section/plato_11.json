    "main_text": "The historical Socrates: early, middle, and late dialogues\n12. Why dialogues?\n\nIt is equally unrealistic to suppose that when Plato embarked on his\ncareer as a writer, he made a conscious decision to put all of the\ncompositions that he would henceforth compose for a general reading\npublic (with the exception of Apology) in the form of a\ndialogue. If the question, \u201cwhy did Plato write\ndialogues?\u201d, which many of his readers are tempted to ask,\npre-supposes that there must have been some such once-and-for-all\ndecision, then it is poorly posed. It makes better sense to break that\nquestion apart into many little ones: better to ask, \u201cWhy did\nPlato write this particular work (for example:\nProtagoras, or Republic, or Symposium, or\nLaws) in the form of a dialogue\u2014and that one\n(Timaeus, say) mostly in the form of a long and\nrhetorically elaborate single speech?\u201d than to ask why he\ndecided to adopt the dialogue form.\n\nThe best way to form a reasonable conjecture about why Plato wrote any\ngiven work in the form of a dialogue is to ask: what would be lost,\nwere one to attempt to re-write this work in a way that eliminated the\ngive-and-take of interchange, stripped the characters of their\npersonality and social markers, and transformed the result into\nsomething that comes straight from the mouth of its author? This is\noften a question that will be easy to answer, but the answer might\nvary greatly from one dialogue to another. In pursuing this strategy,\nwe must not rule out the possibility that some of Plato\u2019s\nreasons for writing this or that work in the form of a dialogue will\nalso be his reason for doing so in other cases\u2014perhaps some of\nhis reasons, so far as we can guess at them, will be present in all\nother cases. For example, the use of character and conversation allows\nan author to enliven his work, to awaken the interest of his\nreadership, and therefore to reach a wider audience. The enormous\nappeal of Plato\u2019s writings is in part a result of their dramatic\ncomposition. Even treatise-like compositions\u2014Timaeus\nand Laws, for example\u2014improve in readability because of\ntheir conversational frame. Furthermore, the dialogue form allows\nPlato\u2019s evident interest in pedagogical questions (how is it\npossible to learn? what is the best way to learn? from what sort of\nperson can we learn? what sort of person is in a position to learn?)\nto be pursued not only in the content of his compositions but also in\ntheir form. Even in Laws such questions are not far from\nPlato\u2019s mind, as he demonstrates, through the dialogue form, how\nit is possible for the citizens of Athens, Sparta, and Crete to learn\nfrom each other by adapting and improving upon each other\u2019s\nsocial and political institutions.\n\nIn some of his works, it is evident that one of Plato\u2019s goals is\nto create a sense of puzzlement among his readers, and that the\ndialogue form is being used for this purpose. The Parmenides\nis perhaps the clearest example of such a work, because here Plato\nrelentlessly rubs his readers\u2019 faces in a baffling series of\nunresolved puzzles and apparent contradictions. But several of his\nother works also have this character, though to a smaller degree: for\nexample, Protagoras (can virtue be taught?), Hippias\nMinor (is voluntary wrongdoing better than involuntary\nwrongdoing?), and portions of Meno (are some people virtuous\nbecause of divine inspiration?). Just as someone who encounters\nSocrates in conversation should sometimes be puzzled about whether he\nmeans what he says (or whether he is instead speaking ironically), so\nPlato sometimes uses the dialogue form to create in his readers a\nsimilar sense of discomfort about what he means and what we ought to\ninfer from the arguments that have been presented to us. But Socrates\ndoes not always speak ironically, and similarly Plato\u2019s\ndialogues do not always aim at creating a sense of bafflement\nabout what we are to think about the subject under discussion. There\nis no mechanical rule for discovering how best to read a dialogue, no\ninterpretive strategy that applies equally well to all of his works.\nWe will best understand Plato\u2019s works and profit most from our\nreading of them if we recognize their great diversity of styles and\nadapt our way of reading accordingly. Rather than impose on our\nreading of Plato a uniform expectation of what he must be doing\n(because he has done such a thing elsewhere), we should bring to each\ndialogue a receptivity to what is unique to it. That would be the most\nfitting reaction to the artistry in his philosophy.\n",
