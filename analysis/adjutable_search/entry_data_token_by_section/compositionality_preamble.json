    "main_text": "\n\nAnything that deserves to be called a language must contain meaningful\nexpressions built up from other meaningful expressions. How are their\ncomplexity and meaning related? The traditional view is that the\nrelationship is fairly tight: the meaning of a complex expression is\nfully determined by its structure and the meanings of its\nconstituents\u2014once we fix what the parts mean and how they are\nput together we have no more leeway regarding the meaning of the\nwhole. This is the principle of compositionality, a fundamental\npresupposition of most contemporary work in semantics.\n\nProponents of compositionality typically emphasize the productivity\nand systematicity of our linguistic understanding. We can understand a\nlarge\u2014perhaps infinitely large\u2014collection of complex\nexpressions the first time we encounter them, and if we understand\nsome complex expressions we tend to understand others that can be\nobtained by recombining their constituents. Compositionality is\nsupposed to feature in the best explanation of these phenomena.\nOpponents of compositionality typically point to cases when meanings\nof larger expressions seem to depend on the intentions of the speaker,\non the linguistic environment, or on the setting in which the\nutterance takes place without their parts displaying a similar\ndependence. They try to respond to the arguments from productivity and\nsystematicity by insisting that the phenomena are limited, and by\nsuggesting alternative explanations.\n",
