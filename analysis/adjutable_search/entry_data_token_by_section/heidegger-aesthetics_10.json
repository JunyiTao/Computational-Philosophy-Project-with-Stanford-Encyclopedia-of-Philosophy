(PLT 80/GA5\n68)\n\n\nStill, Heidegger nurtures the hope that (pace Hegel) the\ndistinctive truth manifest in art could once again attain the kind of\nhistory-transforming importance that Hegel and Heidegger agree it had\nfor the ancient Greeks but has lost in the modern world.\n\n\nThis \u201chighest\u201d truth of art for which Heidegger still\nhopes, however, is not Hegel\u2019s \u201ccertainty of the\nabsolute\u201d (GA5 68 note a). That is, Heidegger does not hold\nout hope for some perfect correspondence between (1) the\nhistorically-unfolding \u201cconcept\u201d Hegel believed was\nimplicit in the development of humanity\u2019s intersubjective\nself-understanding and (2) an objective manifestation of that\nintersubjective self-understanding in art. Thus, in Hegel\u2019s\nmost famous example, the tragic conflict between Antigone and Creon in\nSophocles\u2019 Antigone perfectly embodied the fundamental\nbut as of yet unresolved ethical conflicts\u2014between conscience and\nlaw, the family and the state, and so on\u2014which had arisen\nimplicitly in the intersubjective self-understanding of fifth-century\nAthens. Hegel thinks it is no longer possible for an artwork to\nperfectly express the tensions implicit in the self-understanding of\nthe age and thereby call for an historical people to envision a future\nage in which those tensions would be resolved (because this role was\ntaken over by religion and then by philosophy as our historical\nself-understanding grew increasingly complex). Heidegger,\nhowever, continues to hope for even more, namely, an artwork that\nalready embodies the transition between this age and the next\nand which is thus capable of helping to inaugurate that future age,\nhere and now.\n\n\nIn tacit opposition to Hegel, Heidegger thus suggests that\nart\u2019s highest \u201c[t]ruth is [not \u2018the certainty of the\nabsolute\u2019 but] the unconcealedness of entities as entities.\nTruth is the truth of being\u201d (PLT 81/GA5 69).\nHeidegger\u2019s defining hope for art, in other words, is that works\nof art could manifest and thereby help usher in a new understanding of\nthe being of entities, a literally \u201cpost-modern\u201d\nunderstanding of what it means for an entity to be, a postmodern\nontology which would no longer understand entities either as modern\nobjects to be controlled or as late-modern resources to be\n optimized.[28]\nHeidegger\nexpresses this hope that separates him from Hegel in the form of a\nquestion: \u201cThe truth of Hegel\u2019s judgment has not yet\nbeen decided,\u201d he writes, because\n\n\nthe question remains: Is art still an essential and a\nnecessary way in which that truth happens which is decisive for our\nhistorical existence, or is art this no longer? (PLT 80/GA5\n68)\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s point is that Hegel will no longer be\nright\u2014the time of great art will no longer be at an end\u2014if\ncontemporary humanity still needs an encounter with art in order to learn how\nto understand the being of entities in a genuinely post-modern\n way, and if we still remain capable of such an\n encounter.[29]\n\n\nAs this suggests, the ultimate goal of Heidegger\u2019s thinking\nabout art is to show what it would mean to move from a modern aesthetic\nexperience of an art object to a genuinely post-modern encounter with a\nwork of art, so that we can thereby learn from art how to transcend\nmodernity from within. As Heidegger will later claim, when we\nencounter a true work of art,\n\n\nthe presencing [Anwesen] of that which appears to our\nlook\u2026is different than the standing of what stands-opposite [us]\nin the sense of an object. (PLT 82/GA5 71)\n\n\nBut what exactly is the difference between an aesthetic experience\nof an art object and an encounter with the true\n\u201cpresencing\u201d of a work of art? And how is the\ntraversing of that difference in our engagement with a particular work\nof art supposed to teach us to understand being in a post-modern\nway? Part III explains Heidegger\u2019s fairly complex answers to\nthese difficult but momentous questions.\n",
