    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201cnatural religion\u201d is sometimes taken to refer to\na pantheistic doctrine according to which nature itself is\ndivine. \u201cNatural theology\u201d, by contrast, originally\nreferred to (and still sometimes refers\n to)[1]\n the project of arguing for the existence of God on the basis of\nobserved natural facts. \n\nIn contemporary philosophy, however, both \u201cnatural\nreligion\u201d and \u201cnatural theology\u201d typically refer to\nthe project of using all of the cognitive faculties that are\n\u201cnatural\u201d to human beings\u2014reason, sense-perception,\nintrospection\u2014to investigate religious or theological matters.\nNatural religion or theology, on the present understanding, is not\nlimited to empirical inquiry into nature, and it is not wedded to a\npantheistic result. It does, however, avoid appeals to special\nnon-natural faculties (ESP, telepathy, mystical experience) or\nsupernatural sources of information (sacred texts, revealed theology,\ncreedal authorities, direct supernatural communication). In general,\nnatural religion or theology (hereafter \u201cnatural\ntheology\u201d) aims to adhere to the same standards of rational\ninvestigation as other philosophical and scientific enterprises, and\nis subject to the same methods of evaluation and critique. Natural\ntheology is typically contrasted with \u201crevealed theology\u201d,\nwhere the latter explicitly appeals to special revelations such as\nmiracles, scriptures, and divinely-superintended commentaries and\ncreedal formulations. (See DeCruz and DeSmedt 2015)\n\nPhilosophers and religious thinkers across almost every epoch and\ntradition (Near Eastern, African, Asian, and European) have engaged\nthe project of natural theology, either as proponents or critics. The\nquestion of whether natural theology is a viable project is at the\nroot of some of the deepest religious divisions: Shi\u2019ite\nthinkers are optimistic about reason\u2019s ability to prove various\ntheological and ethical truths, for instance, while Sunnis are not;\nRoman Catholic theologians typically think that reason provides\ndemonstrations of the existence of God, while many Protestant\ntheologians do not. Unlike most of the topics discussed in an\nencyclopedia of philosophy, this is one over which wars have been\nfought and throats have been cut.\n\nThe most active discussions of natural theology in the West occurred\nduring the high medieval period (roughly 1100\u20131400 C.E.) and the\nearly modern period (1600\u20131800 C.E.). The past few decades have\nwitnessed a revival of natural theological debate in the public\nsphere: there are now institutes promoting \u201cIntelligent Design\nTheory\u201d, popular apologetics courses, campus debates between\nbelievers and agnostics, a \u201cNew Atheist\u201d movement, Youtube\ndebates between apologists and atheists regarding new books in natural\ntheology (such as the one between Nathan Lewis and Bernie Dehler on\nthe Blackwell Companion to Natural\n Theology),[2]\n and TED talks by famous atheists on how to resist natural religion\n(such as the one by Richard Dawkins in February\n 2002).[3]\n\nAmong professional philosophers (who aren\u2019t typically part of\nthese more popular debates), arguments over our ability to justify\npositive or negative answers to religious questions have become fairly\ntechnical, often employing sophisticated logical techniques in an\neffort to advance the discussion instead of retreading the same old\nground. The prestigious Gifford Lectures series hosted by a consortium\nof Scottish universities, however, has tried to feature new but still\naccessible work in natural theology for over 100 years (it too has a\nYoutube\n channel!)[4]\n\nIn this article, we aim to avoid most the more recent complexities but\nalso explain their origins by focusing on some central developments in\nthe early modern period that helped to frame contemporary natural\ntheological debates. We are focused here only on theoretical\narguments (both a priori and a posteriori or\nempirical ones). It is controversial whether moral arguments\nare also part of natural theology, but we set them aside here (see\nalso the entry on\n God, arguments for the existence of: moral arguments).\n",
