Supertasks in Relativistic Spacetime\n\nIn Newtonian physics, time passes at the same rate for all observers.\nIf Alice and Bob are both present at Alice\u2019s 20th and 21st birthday\nparties, both people will experience an elapsed time of one year\nbetween the two events. (This is true no matter what Alice or Bob do\nor where Alice and Bob go in between the two events.) Things aren\u2019t so\nsimple in relativistic physics. Elapsed time between events is\nrelative to the path through spacetime a person takes between them. It\nturns out that this fact opens up the possibility of a new type of\nsupertask. Let\u2019s investigate this possibility in a bit more\ndetail.\n",
