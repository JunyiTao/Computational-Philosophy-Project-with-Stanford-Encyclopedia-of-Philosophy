    "main_text": "Nonidentity Cases || Depletion\n2.1 Depletion\n\nThe phenomenon of the precariousness of existence is nicely\nillustrated in Parfit\u2019s depletion case. Suppose that agents as a\ncommunity have chosen to deplete rather than conserve certain\nresources. The consequences of that choice for the people who exist\nnow or will come into existence over the next two centuries will be\n\u201cslightly\u201d better than under a conservation alternative\n(Parfit 1987, 362; see also Parfit 2011 (vol. 2), 218). Thereafter,\nhowever, for many centuries the quality of life would be much lower.\n\u201cThe great lowering of the quality of life must provide some\nmoral reason not to choose Depletion\u201d (Parfit 1987, 363). Surely\nagents ought to have chosen conservation in some form or another\ninstead. But note that, at the same time, depletion seems to harm\nno one. While distant future people, by hypothesis, will\nsuffer as a result of depletion, it is also true that for each such\nperson a conservation choice (very probably) would have changed the\ntiming and manner of the relevant conception. That change, in turn,\nwould have changed the identities of the people conceived and the\nidentities of the people who eventually exist. Any suffering, then,\nthat people endure under the depletion choice would seem to be\nunavoidable if those people are ever to exist at all. Assuming (here\nand throughout) that existence is worth having, we seem forced to\nconclude that depletion does not harm, or make things worse for, and\nis not otherwise \u201cbad for,\u201d anyone at all (Parfit 1987,\n363). At least: depletion does not harm, or make things worse for, and\nis not \u201cbad for,\u201d anyone who does or will exist under\nthe depletion choice.\n\nThe risky policy example, also from Parfit, has a similar structure\n(Parfit 1987, 371\u201372). So does the example of climate change.\nParfit 2017, pp. 122\u2013123. See also Broome 1992.\n",
