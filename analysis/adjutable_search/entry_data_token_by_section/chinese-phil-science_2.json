    "main_text": "Chinese Science as \u201cDaoist\u201d?\n3. Chinese Science as \u201cDaoist\u201d?\n\nThe \u201cNeedham\u201d problem overlaps, but is distinct from two\nother issues. One is the Chinese philosophical attitudes towards\n\u201cnature.\u201d Geoffrey Lloyd and Nathan Sivin (2002) note that\n\u201cnature\u201d was not a conceptual category in early China. Derk\nBodde (1991) distinguished at least seven premodern Chinese attitudes\ntoward what contemporary philosophy and science call nature, ranging\nfrom antagonistic and indifferent to wholly receptive. Nonetheless,\nBodde \u2013 for slightly different reasons than Fung \u2013 argued\nthat a wide range of obstacles hindered the development of science in\nChina. These included: a written language ill adapted to the expression\nof scientific ideas, attitudes toward space and time that were out of\nstep with the facts of nature (1991, 133), and the combined influence\nof an authoritarian imperial government, a conservative academic elite\nand a philosophical tradition preoccupied with morals and burdened by\n\u201corganicist\u201d thinking. Robin Yates (2003) has also noted\nthe importance of the lack of an ex nihilo creator deity and the\n\u201cnon-privileged\u201d status of humans in the cosmos of early\nChinese philosophy. Humans were not distinct from other natural\nphenomena, and were part of a dao that was ultimately\nmysterious and incomprehensible.\n\nThe other is the topic of this essay: the problem of the specific\nengagement between science and early Chinese philosophy, and whether\nChinese philosophy was in some way inimical to scientific inquiry. To\nanswer the latter questions it is necessary to consider both the\nintellectual and social contexts of Chinese philosophy and Chinese\nscience. Which sciences are relevant to Chinese philosophy? Using\nSivin's categorization, the quantitative sciences are largely separate\nfrom the engagement between science and early Chinese philosophy. The\ngreatest degree of engagement between philosophy and science comes from\nthe qualitative sciences of astronomy (or astrology) and medicine.\n\nHow do we reconcile these two entirely different accounts, one by a\nChinese philosopher and the other by several eminent historians of\nscience in China? Part of the answer lies in clarifying several\nshared intellectual contexts for the origins of science in China, as\nwell as several intellectual and social contexts that fostered their\ncomplete divergence, probably by the end of the Han dynasty (206\nBCE-220 CE).\n\n\nChinese philosophy is often identified with\n\u201cConfucianism,\u201d understood to include both the teachings of\nthe historical Confucius, his immediate intellectual descendants in the\nWarring States and Han periods, and later developments known as\nNeo-Confucianism in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties and the present\nday. One source of this view is the explicit adoption of\nConfucian ideologies by the rulers of most but not all dynasties. \nAnother is the intellectual sympathies of many generations of Chinese\ncommentators, and also of particularly Anglophone Sinologists who have\ntended to focus on Confucian philosophies. Confucian philosophers\n\u2013 as distinct from rulers of a broadly Confucian persuasion\n\u2013 were often portrayed as humanists in the sense that they were\nmore interested in problems of ethics and society than in the\ninvestigation of the natural world. This is very much the picture\npresented by Bodde in his negative assessment of the potential for\nscience in premodern China.\n\n\nBut a perception that the history of engagement between philosophy\nand science is limited to \u201cConfucianism,\u201d would present\nonly a partial picture. It is widely recognized that the earliest of\nwhat we would call scientific studies were conducted by the early\nMohists, who wrote treatises on logic, optics and mechanics (Graham\n1978, Needham 1956b, Fung 1922). Mohism did not persist beyond the Han\ndynasty as a textual lineage, but at least some Mohist texts are\npreserved in the Daoist Canon (discussed below). As such,\nwhile Mohism is fundamentally important to any history of science in\nChina, it is not central to an account of the engagement between\nscience and Chinese philosophy.\n\n\nNeedham \u2013 in complete contrast to Fung Yu-lan \u2013\nrepresents the Daoists as both naturalistic and interested in natural\nphenomena. He described Daoism as \u201creligious and poetical,\nyes; but it was also at least as strongly magical, scientific,\ndemocratic, and politically revolutionary\u201d (1956a, 32). On\nthis reading, the history of Daoism also presents a very different\npicture of science and medicine, especially.\n\n\nBut there are several problems with this picture. An initial\nproblem is anachronistic understandings of the nature of early Daoism.\nThese include an oversimplified emphasis on the schools and legendary\nauthors of Daoist texts. There is also a problematic distinction\nbetween the so-called \u201cphilosophical\u201d Daoism (Dao\njia \u9053\u5bb6) of the Daode jing,\nZhuangzi, and Huainanzi and the so-called\n\u201creligious\u201d Daoism (Dao jiao \u9053\u6559) of\nlongevity practices, popular religion, and organized Daoist churches.\nAs Sivin (1978, 1995b) pointed out in a series of article begun over\nthirty years ago, simplistic stereotypes of Daoism as mystical or\nnaturalistic obscure understanding of the relations between Daoism and\nscience.\n\n\nSivin (1995a) points to important differences between popular\nreligion and specifically Daoist religious movements that had little\nconection to either philosophy or the study of nature. His point\nis that most scientific and technical expertise arose from popular\nsources and not from Daoist schools; and once this key distinction is\nmade, we no longer need to mis-classify all or most Chinese science as\nDaoist (as did Needham). This move also allows us to clarify that\nsome Daoist masters, whose objective was union with divinity, were not\npursuing the study of rational inquiry or systematic\nexperimentation. Rather, they were making use of existing\ntechnical knowledge and practices, and adapting them to their own ends,\nbut not generally improving on them in any way. However, the\nimportant point is that the Daoist schools kept written records, which\nthe artisans who developed the original expertise, did not. As a\nresult, historians of science have tended to credit the Daoists with\ninnovations that they probably recorded, rather than developed.\n\n\nSivin\u2019s account usefully explains why the fact that many records\nof scientific innovation appear only in the Daoist Canon does\nnot make them inherently Daoist.  The Daoist Canon  (Dao\nzang \u9053\u85cf) was first printed in about 1477, and was\nreprinted in a commercial edition in 1924\u20131926. The original\nedition consisted of some 5,305 volumes, on a wide range of subjects,\nincluding astronomy and cosmology, biology and botany, medicine and\npharmacology, chemistry and mineralogy, and mathematics and\nphysics. Much of the engagement with science after the Han dynasty is\nrelegated the \u201cnon-philosophical\u201d texts classified as\nDao jiao, and often in ways that obscure the relation between\nphilosophy and science in early China.\n",
