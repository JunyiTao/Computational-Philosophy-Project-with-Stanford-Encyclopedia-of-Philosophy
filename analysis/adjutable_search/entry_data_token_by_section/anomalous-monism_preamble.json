    "main_text": "\n\nAnomalous Monism is a theory about the scientific status of\npsychology, the physical status of mental events, and the relation\nbetween these issues developed by Donald Davidson. It claims that\npsychology cannot be a science like basic physics, in that it cannot\nin principle yield exceptionless laws for predicting or explaining\nhuman thoughts and actions (mental anomalism). It also holds that\nthoughts and actions must be physical (monism, or token-identity).\nThus, according to Anomalous Monism, psychology cannot be reduced to\nphysics, but must nonetheless share a physical ontology.\n\nWhile neither of these claims, on its own, is novel, their relation,\naccording to Anomalous Monism, is. It is precisely because\nthere can be no such strict laws governing mental events that those\nevents must be identical to physical events. Previous\nidentity theories of mind had held that claims concerning the identity\nof particular mental and physical events (tokens) depended upon the\ndiscovery of lawlike relations between mental and physical properties\n(types). Empirical evidence for psychophysical laws was thus held to\nbe required for particular token-identity claims. Token-identity\nclaims thus depended upon type-identity. Davidson\u2019s position is\ndramatically different\u2014it requires no empirical evidence and\ndepends on there being no lawlike relations between mental\nand physical properties. It in effect justifies the token-identity of\nmental and physical events through arguing for the impossibility of\ntype-identities between mental and physical properties. (For\ndiscussion of philosophical positions related to Anomalous Monism, see\nthe supplement on\n Related Views.)\n\nThe appeal of Anomalous Monism is due to these enigmatic features, a\nfairly straightforward argumentative structure, and its attempt to\nbring together an intuitively acceptable metaphysics (monism) with a\nsophisticated understanding of the relation between psychological and\nphysical explanatory schemes (anomalism). Its explicit assumptions are\neach intended, on their own, to be acceptable to positions opposing\nmonism, but, when taken together, to show that monism is in fact\nrequired.\n",
