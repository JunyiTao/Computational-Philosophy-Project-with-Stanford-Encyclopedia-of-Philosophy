    "main_text": "Reciprocal Altruism\n4. Reciprocal Altruism\n\n\nThe theory of reciprocal altruism was originally developed by Trivers\n(1971), as an attempt to explain cases of (apparent) altruism among\nunrelated organisms, including members of different species. (Clearly,\nkin selection cannot help explain altruism among non-relatives.)\nTrivers' basic idea was straightforward: it may pay an organism to\nhelp another, if there is an expectation of the favour being returned\nin the future. (\u2018If you scratch my back, I'll scratch\nyours\u2019.) The cost of helping is offset by the likelihood of the\nreturn benefit, permitting the behaviour to evolve by natural\nselection. Trivers termed with evolutionary mechanism\n\u2018reciprocal altruism\u2019.\n\n\nFor reciprocal altruism to work, there is no need for the two\nindividuals to be relatives, nor even to be members of the same\nspecies. However, it is necessary that individuals should interact\nwith each more than once, and have the ability to recognize other\nindividuals with whom they have interacted in the\n past.[1] \n If individuals interact only once in their lifetimes and never meet\nagain, there is obviously no possibility of return benefit, so there\nis nothing to be gained by helping another. However, if individuals\nencounter each other frequently, and are capable of identifying and\npunishing \u2018cheaters\u2019 who have refused to help in the past,\nthen the helping behaviour can evolve.  A \u2018cheat\u2019 who\nrefuses to help will ultimately sabotage his own interests, for\nalthough he does not incur the cost of helping others, he forfeits the\nreturn benefits too\u2014others will not help him in the\nfuture. This evolutionary mechanism is most likely to work where\nanimals live in relatively small groups, increasing the likelihood of\nmultiple encounters.\n\nAs West et al. (2007) and Bowles and Gintis (2011) note, if altruism is defined by reference to\nlifetime fitness, then Trivers' theory is not really about the\nevolution of altruism at all; for behaviours that evolve via\nreciprocation of benefits, as described by Trivers, are ultimately of\ndirect benefit to the individuals performing them, so do not reduce\nlifetime fitness. Despite this consideration, the label \u2018reciprocal\naltruism\u2019 is well-entrenched in the literature, and the evolutionary\nmechanism that it describes is of some importance, whatever it is\ncalled. Where reciprocal altruism is referred to below, it should be\nremembered that the behaviours in question are only altruistic in the\nshort-term. \n\n\nThe concept of reciprocal altruism is closely related to the\nTit-for-Tat strategy in the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) from\ngame theory. In the IPD, players interact on multiple occasions, and\nare able to adjust their behaviour depending on what their opponent\nhas done in previous rounds. There are two possible strategies,\nco-operate and defect; the payoff matrix (per interaction) is as in\nsection 2.1 above. The fact that the game is iterated rather than\none-shot obviously changes the optimal course of action; defecting is\nno longer necessarily the best option, so long as the probability of\nsubsequent encounters is sufficiently high. In their famous computer\ntournament in which a large number of strategies were pitted against\neach other in the IPD, Axelrod and Hamilton (1981) found that the\nTit-for-Tat strategy yielded the highest payoff. In Tit-For-Tat, a\nplayer follows two basic rules: (i) on the first encounter, cooperate;\n(ii) on subsequent encounters, do what your opponent did on the\nprevious encounter. The success of Tit-for-Tat was widely taken to\nconfirm the idea that with multiple encounters, natural selection\ncould favour social behaviours that entail a short-term fitness\ncost. Subsequent work in evolutionary game theory, much of it inspired\nby Axelrod and Hamilton's ideas, has confirmed that repeated games\npermit the evolution of social behaviours that cannot evolve in\none-shot situations (cf. Nowak 2006); this is closely related to the\nso-called 'folk theorem' of repeated game theory in economics\n(cf. Bowles and Gintis 2011). For a useful discussion of social\nbehaviour that evolves via reciprocation of benefits, see Sachs\net al. 2004.\n\n\nDespite the attention paid to reciprocal altruism by theoreticians,\nclear-cut empirical examples in non-human animals are relatively few\n(Hammerstein 2003, Sachs et al. 2004, Taborsky 2013). This is\nprobably because the pre-conditions for reciprocal altruism to evolve-\nmultiple encounters and individual recognition\u2014are not especially\ncommon. However, one possible example is provided by blood-sharing in\nvampire bats (Wilkinson 1984, 1990, Carter & Wilkinson 2013). It\nis quite common for a vampire bat to fail to feed on a given\nnight. This is potentially fatal, for bats die if they go without food\nfor more than a couple of days. On any given night, bats donate blood\n(by regurgitation) to other members of their group who have failed to\nfeed, thus saving them from starvation. Since vampire bats live in\nsmall groups and associate with each other over long periods of time,\nthe preconditions for reciprocal altruism are likely to be met.\nWilkinson and his colleagues' studies showed that bats tended to share\nfood with their close associates, and were more likely to share with\nothers that had recently shared with them. These findings appear to\naccord with reciprocal altruism theory.\n\n\nTrivers (1985) describes an apparent case of reciprocal altruism\nbetween non con-specifics. On tropical coral reefs, various species of\nsmall fish act as \u2018cleaners\u2019 for large fish, removing\nparasites from their mouths and gills. The interaction is mutually\nbeneficial\u2014the large fish gets cleaned and the cleaner gets\nfed. However, Trivers notes that the large fish sometimes appear to\nbehave altruistically towards the cleaners. If a large fish is\nattacked by a predator while it has a cleaner in its mouth, then it\nwaits for the cleaner to leave before fleeing the predator, rather\nthan swallowing the cleaner and fleeing immediately. Trivers explains\nthe larger fish's behaviour in terms of reciprocal altruism. Since the\nlarge fish often returns to the same cleaner many times over, it pays\nto look after the cleaner's welfare, i.e., not to swallow it, even if\nthis increases the chance of being wounded by a predator. So the\nlarger fish allows the cleaner to escape, because there is an\nexpectation of return benefit\u2014getting cleaned again in the\nfuture. As in the case of the vampire bats, it is because the large\nfish and the cleaner interact more than once that the behaviour can\nevolve.\n",
