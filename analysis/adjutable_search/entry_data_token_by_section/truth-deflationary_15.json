    "main_text": "Objections to Deflationism || Normativity\n4.7 Normativity\n\nIt is commonly said that our beliefs and assertions aim at truth, or\npresent things as being true, and that truth is therefore a\nnorm of assertion and belief. This putative fact about truth\nand assertion in particular has been seen to suggest that deflationism\nmust be false (cf. Wright 1992 and Bar-On and Simmons 2007). However,\nthe felt incompatibility between normativity and deflationism is\ndifficult to make precise.\n\nThe first thing to note is that there is certainly a sense in which\ndeflationism is consistent with the idea that truth is a norm of\nassertion. To illustrate this, notice (as we saw in examining\ntruth\u2019s putative explanatory role) that we can obtain an\nintuitive understanding of this idea without mentioning truth at all,\nso long as we focus on a particular case. Suppose that for whatever\nreason Mary sincerely believes that snow is green, has good evidence\nfor this belief, and on the basis of this belief and evidence asserts\nthat snow is green. We might say that there is a norm of assertion\nthat implies that Mary is still open to criticism in this case. After\nall, since snow is not green, there must be something\nincorrect or defective about Mary\u2019s assertion\n(and similarly for her belief). It is this incorrectness or\ndefectiveness that the idea that truth is a norm of assertion (and\nbelief) is trying to capture.\n\nTo arrive at a general statement of the norm that lies behind this\nparticular case, consider that here, what we recognize is\n\n(13)\nIf someone asserts that snow is green when snow is not green, then\nthat assertion is open to criticism.\n\n\nTo generalize on this, what we want to do is generalize on the\npositions occupied by \u2018snow is green\u2019 and express\nsomething along the lines of\n\n(14)\nFor all \\(p\\), if someone asserts that \\(p\\) when \\({\\sim}p\\),\nthen that assertion is open to criticism.\n\n\nThe problem of providing a general statement like (14) is the same\nissue first raised in Section 1.3, and the solution by now should be\nfamiliar. To state the norm in general we would need to be able to do\nsomething we seem unable to do in ordinary language, namely, employ\nsentential variables and quantifiers for them. But this is where the\nnotion of truth comes in. Because (ES) gives us its\ncontraposition,\n\n(ES-con)\n\\({\\sim}p\\) iff \\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) is not true.\n\n\nReading \u2018\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\)\u2019 as \u2018that\n\\(p\\)\u2019, we can reformulate (14) as\n\n(15)\nFor all \\(p\\), if someone asserts that \\(p\\) when that \\(p\\) is\nnot true, then that assertion is open to criticism.\n\n\nBut since the variable \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 occurs only in nominalized\ncontexts in (15), we can replace it with an object variable,\n\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019, and bind this with an ordinary objectual\nquantifier, to get\n\n(16)\nFor all \\(x\\), if someone asserts \\(x\\), and \\(x\\) is not true,\nthen that assertion is open to criticism.\n\n\nOr, to put it as some philosophers might:\n\n(N)\nTruth is a norm of assertion.\n\n\nIn short, then, deflationists need not deny that we appeal to the\nnotion of truth to express a norm of assertion; on the\ncontrary, the concept of truth seems required to state that very\ngeneralization.\n\nIf deflationists can account for the fact that we must apply the\nnotion of truth to express a norm of assertion, then does normativity\npose any problem for deflationism? Crispin Wright (1992, 15\u201323)\nargues that it does, claiming that deflationism is inherently unstable\nbecause there is a distinctive norm for assertoric practice that goes\nbeyond the norms for warranted assertibility \u2013 that the norms of\ntruth and warranted assertibility are potentially extensionally\ndivergent. This separate norm of truth, he claims, is already implicit\njust in acceptance of the instances of (ES). He points out that not\nhaving warrant to assert some sentence does not yield having warrant\nto assert its negation. However, because (ES) gives us (ES-con), we\nhave, in each instance, an inference (going from right to left) from\nthe sentence mentioned not being true to the negation of the sentence.\nBut the instance of (ES) for the negation of any sentence,\n\n(ES-neg)\n\\(\\langle{\\sim} p \\rangle\\) is true iff \\({\\sim}p,\\)\n\n\ntakes us (again, going from right to left) from the negated sentence\nto an ascription of truth to that negated sentence. Thus, some\nsentence not being true does yield that the negation of the\nsentence is true, in contrast with warranted assertibility. This\ndifference, Wright (ibid., 18) claims, reveals that, by\ndeflationism\u2019s own lights, the truth predicate expresses a\ndistinct norm governing assertion, which is incompatible with the\ndeflationary contention \u201cthat \u2018true\u2019 is only\ngrammatically a predicate whose role is not to attribute a substantial\ncharacteristic\u201d.\n\nRejecting Wright\u2019s argument for the instability of deflationism,\nIan Rumfitt (1995, 103) notes that if we add the ideas of denying\nsomething and of having warrant for doing so\n(\u201canti-warrant\u201d) to Wright\u2019s characterization of\ndeflationism, this would make \u2018is not true\u2019 simply a\ndevice of rejection governed by the norm that \u201c[t]he predicate\n\u2018is not true\u2019 may be applied to any sentence for which one\nhas an anti-warrant\u201d. But then truth-talk\u2019s behavior with\nnegation would not have to be seen as indicating that it marks a\ndistinct norm beyond justified assertibility and justifiable\ndeniability, which would be perfectly compatible with\ndeflationism.\n\nField (1994a, 264\u20135) offers a deflationary response to\nWright\u2019s challenge (as well as to a similar objection regarding\nnormativity from Putnam (1983a, 279\u201380)), pointing again to the\ngeneralizing role of the truth predicate in such normative desires as\none to utter only true sentences or one to have only true beliefs.\nField agrees with Wright that truth-talk expresses a norm beyond\nwarranted assertibility, but he (1994a, 265) also maintains that\n\u201cthere is no difficulty in desiring that all one\u2019s beliefs\nbe disquotationally true; and not only can each of us desire such\nthings, there can be a general practice of badgering other to into\nhaving such desires\u201d. Horwich (1996, 879\u201380) argues that\nWright\u2019s rejection of deflationism does not follow from showing\nthat one can use the truth predicate to express a norm beyond\nwarranted assertibility. Like Field, Horwich claims that Wright missed\nthe point that, in the expression of such a norm, the truth predicate\nis just playing its generalizing role.
