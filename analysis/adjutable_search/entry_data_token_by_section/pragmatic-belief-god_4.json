    "main_text": "Consolation and Needs-based Arguments\n5. Consolation and Needs-based Arguments\n\nIn 1770 James Beattie (1735\u20131803) published a long response to\nHume entitled An Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, in\nOpposition to Sophistry and Scepticism. The essay was a 300 page\nbest seller, which, most commentators agree, was unfair in many\nrespects to Hume. As was his practice, Hume never made an effort to\nanswer Beattie in public; in correspondence, however, Hume referred to\nBeattie as that \u201cbigoted silly\n fellow.\u201d[7]\n\nDespite the general weakness of many of his arguments Beattie does\noffer an interesting pragmatic moral objection to Hume\u2019s attack\non religious belief:\n\n\u2026they perhaps have little need, and little relish, for the\nconsolations of religion. But let them know that, in the solitary\nscenes of life, there is many an honest and tender heart pining with\nincurable anguish, pierced with the sharpest sting of disappointment,\nbereft of friends, chilled with poverty, racked with disease, scourged\nby the oppressor; whom nothing but trust in Providence, and the hope\nof a future retribution, could preserve from the agonies of despair.\nAnd do they, with sacrilegious hands, attempt to violate this last\nrefuge of the miserable, and to rob them of the only comfort that had\nsurvived the ravages of the misfortune, malice, and tyranny! Did it\never happen, that the influence of their execrable tenets disturbed\nthe tranquility of virtuous retirement, deepened the gloom of human\ndistress, or aggravated the horrors of the grave? Is it possible that\nthis may have happened in many instances? Is it probable that this\nhath happened, or may happen, in one single instance? \u2013 ye\ntraitors to human kind, how can ye answer for it to your own hearts?\n(Beattie 1776, 322\u201323).\n\n\nBeattie argues that Hume\u2019s clear cutting of the theistic forest\nin his attack on the credibility of miracle reports, his criticism of\nthe design argument, and his attack on the cosmological argument\nresulted in a desolated landscape that does a serious disservice to\nhumankind. Since in some cases, Beattie contends, despair flows from\nthe loss of faith. And he assumes that no justifying good exists for\nHume to risk causing despair.\n\nLet\u2019s understand desolation as a profound sense of hopelessness\nand purposelessness. Beattie believed that Christian belief provided\nconsolation, especially to those suffering or oppressed. His argument\nmight be reconstructed as there exists a person S, such\nthat:\n\nTheistic belief provides the great good of consolation for\nS. And,\nS cannot receive a comparable good from any other source.\nAnd,\nThe deprivation of this good is a significant loss for S.\nSo,\nDepriving S of the great good of theistic belief renders\nS significantly worse-off. And,\nIt is wrong to render someone worse-off without compensation.\nAnd,\nPublic atheistic attacks provide S with no sufficient\ncompensation. Therefore,\nPublic atheistic attacks are wrong.\n\n\nWhile Hume never directly responded to Beattie\u2019s Consolation\nArgument, Mill had it (or something very much like it in mind) when he\nwrote:\n\nThat what is called the consoling nature of an opinion, that is, the\npleasure we should have in believing it to be true, can be a ground\nfor believing it, is a doctrine irrational in itself and which would\nsanction half the mischievous illusions recorded in history or which\nmislead individual life. (Mill 1874, 204)\n\n\nThis is an odd objection coming from one who argued in\nUtilitarianism \u201cactions are right in proportion as they\ntend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse\nof happiness.\u201d If the sole criterion of action is the production\nof happiness, and if forming a belief is an action, then it is hard to\nsee what answer could be lodged against Beattie\u2019s Consolation\nArgument (or at least some argument very much like\n it).[8]\n If happiness and consolation are irrelevant, and if Clifford\u2019s\nRule that \u201cit is wrong always, everywhere, and for any one, to\nbelieve anything upon insufficient evidence\u201d is correct, then\nBeattie\u2019s consolation argument can be rejected as being itself\nan immoral\n subornation.[9]\n\nAn argument similar to Beattie\u2019s consolation argument is found\nin a suggestive passage of John Henry Newman\u2019s 1870 An Essay\nin Aid of A Grammar of Assent, famously known as the\n\u201cfactory girl\u201d argument. Newman (1801\u20131890) did not\nformulate the \u201cfactory girl\u201d argument as a pragmatic\nargument, but the argument certainly lends itself to such a\nformulation:\n\n\nMontaigne was endowed with a good estate, health, leisure and an easy\ntemper, literary tastes, and a sufficiency of books; he could afford\nthus to play with life, and the abysses into which it leads us. Let us\ntake a case in contrast.\n\n\u201cI think\u201d, says the poor dying factory-girl in the tale,\n\u201cif this should be the end of all, and if all I have been born\nfor is just to work my heart and life away, and to sicken in this dree\nplace, with those mill-stones in my ears forever, until I could scream\nout for them to stop and let me have a little piece of quiet, and with\nthe fluff filling my lungs, until I thirst to death for one long deep\nbreath of the clear air, and my mother gone, and I never able to tell\nher again how I loved her, and of all my troubles, \u2013 I think, if\nthis life is the end, and that there is no God to wipe away all tears\nfrom all eyes, I could go mad!\u201d\n\n\nHere is an argument for the immortality of the soul (Newman 1870,\n299\u2013300).\n\n\nThis argument lends itself easily to a pragmatic cast since it places\ngreat weight on the idea that certain human needs support the rational\nand moral legitimacy of religious belief:\n\nWe have existential needs \u2013 a need for a deep meaning in\nlife, a need for hope, a need for cosmic security, a need for\nconsolation from despair \u2013 which are necessary for our\nwell-being. And,\nBelief in God satisfies these existential needs. So,\nBelief in God is overall justified.\n\n\nThis sort of argument faces many questions and issues that we cannot\nexplore here. Among these issues and questions are: suppose that one,\nmorally and rationally, may satisfy a need, it does not follow that\none can satisfy that need in any old way. Some ways of satisfying a\nneed are permissible while others are not. Is belief in God a\npermissible way? Do humans in fact have the alleged needs? Is belief\nin God the only feasible way to satisfy those needs? See Williams 2011\nfor further discussion.\n",
