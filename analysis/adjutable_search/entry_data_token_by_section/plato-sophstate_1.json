    "main_text": "Purpose of the Sophist and Statesman\n2. Purpose of the Sophist and Statesman\n\n\nThe Sophist and Statesman each undertake a\nparticular task, the first to define a sophist, the second to define a\nstatesman. But they have a larger purpose. The Statesman\ngives many indications that the investigation of the statesman is\nbeing undertaken not primarily for its own sake but for the sake of a\ngreater project\u2014our becoming better dialecticians\n(Statesman 285d, 286d\u2013287a).\n\n\nThe Stranger makes this announcement, first reminding Young Socrates \nof a previous discussion about children learning their letters:\n\n\nSuppose someone should ask us about the children sitting together\nlearning their letters: when one of them is asked of what letters some\nword or other is composed, do we ever say that the inquiry is more for\nthe sake of the one problem set before him or for the sake of his\nbecoming a better speller in all such cases?\u2014Clearly for the\nsake of his becoming a better speller in all such cases.\u2014Now\nagain what about our inquiry about the statesman? Is it posed more for\nthe sake of that thing itself [the statesman] or for the sake of our\nbecoming more dialectical about everything?\u2014This too is clear,\nthat it\u2019s for the sake of our becoming more dialectical about\neverything. (Statesman 285c\u2013d)\n\n\n\n\nNext the Stranger talks about examples, such as weaving, for which\nthere are perceptible likenesses, easy to understand, which an\ninstructor can point to when an inquirer has trouble grasping a verbal\naccount. But there are other things, described as greatest and most\nvaluable, that cannot be observed or imaged. It is for the sake of\nthose harder topics that the inquirers practice giving and receiving\nan account on simple examples, such as weaving, where they can fall\nback on perceptible instances. The Stranger says:\n\n\nHence it is necessary to practice being able to give and receive a verbal\naccount of each thing. For immaterial things, being finest and\ngreatest, are shown clearly by a verbal account alone and by nothing else,\nand all the things said now are for the sake of those. But in\neverything practice is easier in lesser things, rather than in greater\nthings. (Statesman 286a\u2013b)\n\n\n\n\nWe first practice giving and receiving a verbal account on easy\nexamples like weaving, which can also be observed and imaged. Then we\npractice on difficult examples, such as the statesman. Here we must\ngive and receive a verbal account without relying on visual aids. But\nthe statesman is still part of the exercise. Our inquiry about him is\nitself undertaken to make us better dialecticians, able to deal with\nall such topics. If we can succeed with the statesman, we will have\nlearned a technique, or how to find a technique, that can be applied\nto other difficult cases, such as the philosopher.\n\n\nThe Statesman chiefly aims to demonstrate how to undertake \nall such inquiries. Its own inquiry stimulates the participants (and \nus readers) to recognize what mistakes to avoid and what paths are \nworth pursuing and why. But significantly, as one sees from comparing\nthe treatments of the sophist and statesman, different kinds of \nsubject matter demand different sorts of methods. So we cannot simply\nextend the methods of the Sophist and Statesman in \na mechanical way to the investigation of the philosopher and other \ngreat and difficult topics. These dialogues teach us how to go about \nphilosophical investigations. They do not offer a formula that can be\nsimply applied to further cases.\n\n\nIf the Sophist and Statesman are philosophical \nexercises, there may be a good reason why the final dialogue of the \ntrilogy, the Philosopher, is missing. Plato would spoil the \nlesson if he wrote it for us (cf. Dorter 1994, 236). If we have \nlearned how to investigate philosophical problems in the \nSophist and Statesman, Plato may be challenging his\naudience to search for the philosopher themselves, using the \ntechniques and recommendations these dialogues provide (M. L. Gill, 2012).\n",
