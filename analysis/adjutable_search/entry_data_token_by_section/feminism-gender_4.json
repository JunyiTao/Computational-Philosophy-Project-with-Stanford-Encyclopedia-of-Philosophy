    "main_text": "Gender as socially constructed || Gender as feminine and masculine personality\n2.2 Gender as feminine and masculine personality\n\nNancy Chodorow (1978; 1995) has criticised social learning theory as\ntoo simplistic to explain gender differences (see also Deaux &\nMajor 1990; Gatens 1996). Instead, she holds that gender is a matter\nof having feminine and masculine personalities that develop in early\ninfancy as responses to prevalent parenting practices. In particular,\ngendered personalities develop because women tend to be the primary\ncaretakers of small children. Chodorow holds that because mothers (or\nother prominent females) tend to care for infants, infant male and\nfemale psychic development differs. Crudely put: the mother-daughter\nrelationship differs from the mother-son relationship because mothers\nare more likely to identify with their daughters than their sons. This\nunconsciously prompts the mother to encourage her son to\npsychologically individuate himself from her thereby prompting him to\ndevelop well defined and rigid ego boundaries. However, the mother\nunconsciously discourages the daughter from individuating herself\nthereby prompting the daughter to develop flexible and blurry ego\nboundaries. Childhood gender socialisation further builds on and\nreinforces these unconsciously developed ego boundaries finally\nproducing feminine and masculine persons (1995, 202\u2013206). This\nperspective has its roots in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, although\nChodorow\u2019s approach differs in many ways from Freud\u2019s.\n\nGendered personalities are supposedly manifested in common gender\nstereotypical behaviour. Take emotional dependency. Women are\nstereotypically more emotional and emotionally dependent upon others\naround them, supposedly finding it difficult to distinguish their own\ninterests and wellbeing from the interests and wellbeing of their\nchildren and partners. This is said to be because of their blurry and\n(somewhat) confused ego boundaries: women find it hard to distinguish\ntheir own needs from the needs of those around them because they\ncannot sufficiently individuate themselves from those close to them.\nBy contrast, men are stereotypically emotionally detached, preferring\na career where dispassionate and distanced thinking are virtues. These\ntraits are said to result from men\u2019s well-defined ego boundaries\nthat enable them to prioritise their own needs and interests sometimes\nat the expense of others\u2019 needs and interests.\n\nChodorow thinks that these gender differences should and can be\nchanged. Feminine and masculine personalities play a crucial role in\nwomen\u2019s oppression since they make females overly attentive to\nthe needs of others and males emotionally deficient. In order to\ncorrect the situation, both male and female parents should be equally\ninvolved in parenting (Chodorow 1995, 214). This would help in\nensuring that children develop sufficiently individuated senses of\nselves without becoming overly detached, which in turn helps to\neradicate common gender stereotypical behaviours.\n",
