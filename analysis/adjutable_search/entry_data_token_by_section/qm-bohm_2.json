    "main_text": "History\n3. History\n\nThe pilot-wave approach to quantum theory was initiated by Einstein,\neven before the discovery of quantum mechanics itself. Einstein hoped\nthat interference phenomena involving particle-like photons could be\nexplained if the motion of the photons was somehow guided by the\nelectromagnetic field\u2014which would thus play the role of what he\ncalled a F\u00fchrungsfeld or guiding field (see Wigner\n[1976] 1983: 262 and Bacciagaluppi and Valentini 2009: Ch. 9). While\nthe notion of the electromagnetic field as guiding field turned out to\nbe rather problematical, Max Born explored the possibility that the\nwave function could play this role, of guiding field or pilot wave,\nfor a system of electrons in his early paper founding quantum\nscattering theory (Born 1926). Heisenberg was profoundly\nunsympathetic. \n\nNot long after Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s discovery of wave mechanics in\n1926, i.e., of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation, a discovery inspired by Louis de Broglie\u2019s 1924 Ph.D. thesis, de Broglie in\neffect discovered Bohmian mechanics: In 1927, de Broglie found an\nequation of particle motion equivalent to\n the guiding equation\n for a scalar wave function (de Broglie 1928: 119), and he explained\nat the 1927 Solvay Congress how this motion could account for quantum\ninterference phenomena. However, despite what is suggested by\nBacciagaluppi and Valentini (2009), de Broglie responded very poorly\nto an objection of Wolfgang Pauli (Pauli 1928) concerning inelastic\nscattering, no doubt making a rather bad impression on the illustrious\naudience at the congress.\n\nBorn and de Broglie very quickly abandoned the pilot-wave approach and\nbecame enthusiastic supporters of the rapidly developing consensus in\nfavor of the Copenhagen interpretation. David Bohm (1952) rediscovered\nde Broglie\u2019s pilot-wave theory in 1952. He was the first person\nto genuinely understand its significance and implications. John Bell\nbecame its principal proponent during the sixties, seventies and\neighties.\n\nFor a very good discussion of the history of quantum mechanics, the\ndebates about its foundations, and about the reception of Bohmian\nmechanics in particular, see Bricmont 2016 and Becker 2018.
