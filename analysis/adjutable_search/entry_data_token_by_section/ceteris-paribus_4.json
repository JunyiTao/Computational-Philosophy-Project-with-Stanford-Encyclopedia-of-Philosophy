The Challenge: Exclusive Ceteris Paribus Laws Between Falsity and Triviality\n\nExclusive cp-laws of the form \u201cexclusively cp, \\(A\\)s are\n\\(B\\)s\u201d admit exceptions, i.e., instantiations of \\(A\\)s\nwhich are not-\\(B\\)s (Pietroski and Rey speak of\n\u201cabnormal\u201d instances; 1995, 88). A philosophical\nreconstruction of exclusive cp-laws\u2014which includes restricted\ncomparative cp-laws and, thus, the majority of all cp-laws\u2014faces\na severe problem. This problem can be articulated in the form of a\ndilemma. This dilemma has been formulated by Lange (1993, 235), who\nattributes it to Hempel (1988).\n\nFirst horn: If exclusive cp-laws are reconstructed as some\nsort of strict law, then they will tend to be false. Typically, it\nwill not be the case that all \\(A\\)s satisfying a completer\ncondition \\(C\\) are \\(B\\)s, since the range of potentially\ndisturbing factors is typically indefinable. For instance, the\nrelationship between supply and price is not always as the law of\nsupply says (or, as it seems to say prima facie), because an\ninterfering factor might occur. In other words, special science laws\nthat instantiate perfect regularities are\u2014mildly\nput\u2014\u201cscarce\u201d (Cartwright 1983, 45). Yet, if one\nsupposes that the law is to be formalized as a universally quantified\nconditional sentence, then one counter-instance (due to a disturbing\nfactor) to the universally quantified sentence means that it is\nfalse.\n\nSecond horn: If we instead suppose that an indefinite\nexclusive ceteris paribus clause is attached to the law so\nthat it means \u201cAll \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s, if nothing\ninterferes\u201d, then the cp-law in question is in danger of\nlacking empirical content. It lacks empirical content because it seems\nto say nothing more than \u201cAll \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s or\nnot-(All \\(A\\)s are \\(B\\)s)\u201d. If this is true, then\nexclusive cp-laws are analytically true sentences and, therefore,\ntrivially true. This, however, is an unwelcome consequence because\nlaws of the special sciences should be reconstructed as empirical\nstatements\u2014not as sentences being true in virtue of meaning.\n\nBoth horns are quite unpleasant results for any philosopher looking\nfor a theory of non-strict laws. To deal with this dilemma is a\ncentral challenge for every theory of ceteris paribus laws\n(Lange 1993; Earman and Roberts 1999; Earman, Roberts and Smith 2002).\nIn the following section, several attempts to cope with this dilemma\nare presented and tenacious problems of them are discussed.\n",
