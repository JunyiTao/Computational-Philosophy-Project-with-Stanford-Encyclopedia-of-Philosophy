Intrinsic nature: between categorization and ontology\n\nTo preserve the principle of impermanence and explain continuity and\ncausal conditioning in ordinary experience, the Buddhist schools\nintroduced novel interpretations of the nature of dharmas. At\nthe heart of these interpretations is the concept of intrinsic nature\n(Skt., svabh\u0101va, Pali, sabh\u0101va) that plays\na major role in the systematization of Abhidharma thought, is closely\nrelated to the consolidation of the dharma theory, and is\nregarded as that which gave an impetus to the Abhidharma growing\nconcern with ontology.\n\nThe term svabh\u0101va/sabh\u0101va does not feature in the\ns\u016btras/suttas and its rare mentions in other\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and Therav\u0101da canonical texts offer no\naccount of dharma as defined by a fixed intrinsic nature that\nverifies its real\n existence.[11]\n This situation changes significantly in the post-canonical\nliterature, in which svabh\u0101va becomes a standard concept\nextensively used in dharma exegesis. A recurring idea in the\nexegetical Abhidharma literature from the period of the early\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia onward is that\ndharmas are defined by virtue of their\nsvabh\u0101va. For instance, a definition transmitted in the\nAbhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya reads:\n\u201cdharma means \u2018upholding,\u2019 [namely],\nupholding intrinsic nature (svabh\u0101va),\u201d and the\nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 states that \u201cintrinsic\nnature is able to uphold its own identity and not lose it [\u2026]\nas in the case of unconditioned dharmas that are able to\nuphold their own identity\u201d (Cox 2004A, 558\u2013559).\nSimilarly, a definition prevalent in Therav\u0101din Abhidhamma\ncommentaries is: \u201cdhammas are so called because they\nbear their intrinsic natures, or because they are borne by causal\nconditions\u201d (e.g., Dhs-a 39-40; Pa\u1e6dis-a\nI 18; Vism-mh\u1e6d I 347). The commentaries also regularly\nequate dhammas with their intrinsic natures, using the terms\ndhamma and sabh\u0101va interchangeably. For\nexample, the Visuddhimagga proclaims that\n\u201cdhamma means but intrinsic nature\u201d\n(Vism VIII 246), and the sub-commentary to the\nDhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i indicates that \u201cthere is no\nother thing called dhamma apart from the intrinsic nature\nborne by it\u201d and that \u201cthe term sabh\u0101va\ndenotes the mere fact of being a dhamma\u201d\n(Dhs-m\u1e6d 28 & 94; see also Karunadasa 2010: Ch.\n1).\n\nThese commentarial definitions of dharmas as carrying their\nintrinsic natures should not be interpreted ontologically as implying\nthat dharmas are substances having inherent existence. The\nPali commentaries, cautions Gethin (2004, 533), \u201care often\nviewed too much in the light of later controversies about the precise\nontological status of dharmas and the Madhyamaka critique of\nthe notion of svabh\u0101va in the sense of \u2018inherent\nexistence.\u2019\u201d In fact, defining dharmas as bearing\ntheir intrinsic natures conveys the idea that there is no enduring\nagent behind them. Adding that dharmas are borne by causal\nconditions counters the idea of intrinsic natures borne by underlying\nsubstances distinct from themselves. Just as dharmas are\npsycho-physical events that occur dependently on appropriate\nconditions and qualities, their intrinsic natures arise dependently on\nother conditions and qualities rather than on a substratum more real\nthan they are (ibid; Karunadasa 1996, 13\u201316;\nNyanaponika 1998, 40\u201341).\n\nWe must also note that the context within which dharmas are\nrendered in terms of their intrinsic natures is that of\ncategorization, where multiple criteria and qualities are applied to\ncreate a comprehensive taxonomic system that distinguishes the\nparticular character of any given dharma. Cox (2004A:\n559\u2013561) has shown that in the early period of northern Indian\nAbhidharma texts, as represented by the\n\u015a\u0101riputr\u0101bhidharma\u015b\u0101stra and\nportions of the Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, the concept\nof intrinsic nature develops within the context of the method of\ninclusion (sa\u1e43graha), that is, the process by which the\ninclusion of dharmas within a specific category is to be\napplied. Dharmas are determined (parini\u1e63panna)\nby the intrinsic nature that defines them and hence should not be\nconsidered to possess a separately existing intrinsic nature.\n\u201c\u2018Determination\u2019 implies two further features of\ndharmas [\u2026] First, just as categories in a\nwell-structured taxonomic schema are distinct and not subject to\nfluctuation, so also dharmas, as \u2018determined,\u2019\nare clearly and unalterably discriminated: they are uniquely\nindividualized and as such are not subject to confusion with other\ndharmas. [Second,] determination by intrinsic nature\nundergoes no variation or modification, and hence, dharmas,\nwhich are in effect types or categories of intrinsic nature, are\nestablished as stable and immutable\u201d (ibid, 562). In\nthe early Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da exegetical texts, then,\nsvabh\u0101va is used as an atemporal, invariable criterion\ndetermining what a dharma is, not necessarily\nthat a dharma exists. The concern here is primarily\nwith what makes categorial types of dharma unique, rather\nthan with the ontological status of dharmas.\n\nNevertheless, from the foregoing categorial theory, the mature\nAbhidharma drew ontological conclusions with regard to the reality of\ndharmas. This transition in the conception of dharma\ncoincided with an inherent ambiguity in the term\nsvabh\u0101va, which is grounded logically and etymologically\nin the term bh\u0101va that came to denote \u201cmode of\nexistence\u201d (ibid, 565\u2013568). In the\nvibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia and contemporaneous texts,\n\u201cthe explicit emphasis upon categorization per se\nrecedes in importance as the focus shifts to clarifying the character\nand eventually the ontological status of individual dharmas.\nAccordingly, the term svabh\u0101va acquires the dominant\nsense of \u2018intrinsic nature\u2019 specifying individual\ndharmas [\u2026] And determining individual\ndharmas through unique intrinsic nature also entails\naffirming their existence, as a natural function both of the\netymological sense of the term svabh\u0101va and of the role\nof dharmas as the fundamental constituents of experience.\nThis then leads to the prominence of a new term that expressed this\nontological focus: namely, dravya\u201d (ibid,\n569). Dravya means \u201creal existence\u201d and, within\nthe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da framework, dharmas that are\ndetermined by intrinsic nature exist as real entities\n(dravyatas), as opposed both to composite objects of ordinary\nexperience that exist provisionally and to relative concepts or\ncontingencies of time and place that exist relatively. The presence of\nintrinsic nature indicates that a dharma is a primary\nexistent, irrespective of its temporal status, namely, whether it is a\npast, present or future dharma, and hence the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da declaration that \u201call things\nexist.\u201d\n\nThe Therav\u0101da rejected the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da ontological\nmodel, claiming that dhammas exist only in the present. But\nthe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma shares with the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nthe same principles of dhamma analysis as a categorial theory\nthat individuates sentient experience. Here, too, the taxonomic\nfunction of sabh\u0101va gave rise to ontological\nconnotations of existence in the characterization of dhammas.\nAs the final units of Abhidhamma analysis, dhammas are\nreckoned the ultimate constituents of experience. \u201cThere is\nnothing else, whether a being, or an entity, or a man or a\nperson,\u201d a famous Pali commentarial excerpt proclaims\n(Dhs-a\n 155).[12]\n While this statement is meant to refute the rival Pudgalav\u0101da\nposition of the reality of the person by insisting that there is no\nbeing or person apart from dhammas, there emerges the idea\nthat the phenomenal world is, at bottom, a world of dhammas:\nthat within the confines of sentient experience there is no other\nactuality apart from dhammas and that what constitutes any\ngiven dhamma as a discrete, individualized particular is its\nintrinsic nature. The Therav\u0101da elaborates on the concept of\nsabh\u0101va in juxtaposition to its theory of momentariness,\nand it acquires the sense of what underlies a dhamma\u2019s\nendurance moment and as a point of reference to the moments of\norigination and cessation. Before a dhamma eventuates it does\nnot yet obtain an intrinsic nature and when it ceases it is denuded of\nthis intrinsic nature. As a present occurrence, though, while\npossessing its intrinsic nature, it exists as an ultimate reality and\nits intrinsic nature is evidence of its actual existence as such\n(Dhs-a 45; Vism VIII 234, XV 15). One commentarial\npassage even goes so far as naming this instant \u201cthe acquisition\nof a self\u201d (Vism-mh\u1e6d I 343).\n",
