    "main_text": "Ontology of Mathematics || Continuity\n1.4 Continuity\n\nThe views of Muslim thinkers regarding mathematical continuum are\nintertwined with the position they uphold in the debate between\natomism and hylomorphism about the nature of the physical world. For\nAvicenna there is no gap between the physical world and the realm of\nmathematical objects. This is so at least if we accept interpretations\nof Avicenna as a literalist regarding the ontology of mathematics. He\nbelieves that geometrical magnitudes are continuous in the sense that\nthey have no actual part. Correspondingly, physical dimensions are\ncontinuous and have no actual parts. We can of course divide any\ncontinuous magnitude into smaller parts. In the physical world, there\nis a practical lower limit for the length of the physical dimensions\nwhich can in practice be broken down into smaller magnitudes. By\ncontrast, in our faculty of estimation, this limit disappears, and all\nmagnitudes are potentially infinitely divisible. Despite this\npractical difference, theoretically speaking, there is no difference\nbetween the structure of geometrical lines and physical dimensions. As\na result, geometrical continuity implies that physical atomism is\nfalse. Indeed, Avicenna appeals to mathematical continuity to reject\nphysical atomism (Avicenna [Ph2]: chap. III.3\u20135; Lettinck 1999;\nDhanani 2015; McGinnis 2019: sec. 3).\n\nIn contrast with Avicenna, there are philosophers who endorse\nmathematical continuity and physical atomism simultaneously. For\ninstance, Shahrast\u0101n\u012b (d. 1153) insists that the judgment of\nthe faculty of estimation is not reliable enough to convince us that\nthe physical magnitudes can bear potentially infinite divisions. He\nbelieves that physical magnitudes are not infinitely divisible. The\nnumber of their parts, either actual or even potential, is finite.\nShahrast\u0101n\u012b reminds us that although the size of the\nuniverse is imaginable to be infinite, philosophers usually reject\nthat the universe is infinite. Relying on a similar approach,\nShahrast\u0101n\u012b contends that although every magnitude is\nimaginable as infinitely divisible, there are strong arguments which\nshow that the faculty of estimation is mistaken in this case and no\nphysical magnitudes are infinitely divisible. Infinite extendibility\nof the size of the universe in the estimation is compatible with the\nuniverse being finite. Similarly, infinite divisibility of magnitudes\nin the estimation could be compatible with their having only a finite\nnumber of (potential) parts in the extramental world, or so\nShahrast\u0101n\u012b seems to believe (al-Shahrast\u0101n\u012b\nSumma philosophiae, 513; McGinnis 2019). This means that if\nwe take mathematical objects as merely estimative constructions, then\nwe can reconcile purely mathematical continuity with physical\natomism.\n\nProposing a subtle modification, Fakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b\n(Al-Man\u1e6diq, vol. 6, chapter 6, 63) argues against\nDemocritus that everything that is divisible in imagination is\ndivisible in the extramental world. He believes that there is a lower\nlimit to the length of divisible magnitudes that we can imagine. It is\nnot true that every magnitude, no matter how small, is divisible in\nthe estimation. He does not reject that in Euclidean geometry\nmagnitudes are infinitely divisible. But he seems not to accept that\nit is possible to make a visual image (through the faculty of\nestimation) of every magnitude we can talk about in the context of\nEuclidean geometry. Embracing physical atomism (in his later works),\nal-R\u0101z\u012b denies that continuous Euclidean geometry can\nrepresent the real structure of the extramental world (Setia 2006;\nEftekhari 2018; 2019). The claim that continuity has no reality other\nthan in the faculty of estimation is often restated in the works of\nthe later atomists like \u02bfA\u1e0d\u016bd al-D\u012bn\nal-\u02be\u012aj\u012b (d. 1355) (Hasan 2017: 233\u201335).\n",
