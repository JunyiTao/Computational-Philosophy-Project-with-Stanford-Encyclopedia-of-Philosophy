    "main_text": "The Ethics of Destroying Human Embryos for Research || The case of \u201cdoomed embryos\u201d\n1.3 The case of \u201cdoomed embryos\u201d\n\n\nWhen spare embryos exist after fertility treatment, the individuals\nfor whom the embryos were created typically have the option of storing\nfor them for future reproductive use, donating them to other infertile\ncouples, donating them to research, or discarding them. Some\nargue that as long as the decision to donate embryos for research is\nmade after the decision to discard them, it is morally permissible to\nuse them in HESC research even if we assume that they have the moral\nstatus of persons. The claim takes two different forms. One is\nthat it is morally permissible to kill an individual who is about to be\nkilled by someone else where killing that individual will help others\n(Curzer, H. 2004). The other is that researchers who derive HESCs\nfrom embryos that were slated for destruction do not cause their\ndeath. Instead, the decision to discard the embryos causes their\ndeath; research just causes the manner of their death (Green \n2002).\n\n\nBoth versions of the argument presume that the decision to discard\nspare embryos prior to the decision to donate them to research entails\nthat donated embryos are doomed to destruction when researchers receive\nthem. There are two arguments one might marshal against this\npresumption. First, one who wants to donate embryos to research\nmight first elect to discard them only because doing so is a\nprecondition for donating them. There could be cases in which one\nwho chooses the discard option would have donated the embryos to other\ncouples were the research donation option not available. The fact\nthat a decision to discard embryos is made prior to the decision to\ndonate the embryos thus does not establish that the embryos were doomed\nto destruction before the decision to donate them to research was\nmade. Second, a researcher who receives embryos could choose to\nrescue them, whether by continuing to store them or by donating them to\ninfertile couples. While this would violate the law, the fact\nthat it is within a researcher\u2019s power to prevent the destruction\nof the embryos he or she receives poses problems for the claim that the\ndecision to discard the embryos dooms them or causes their\ndestruction.\n",
