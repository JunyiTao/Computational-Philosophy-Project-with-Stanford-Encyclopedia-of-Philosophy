    "main_text": "Life and Writings || Early Years\n1.1 Early Years\n\nKarl Marx was born in 1818, one of nine children. The family lived in\nthe Rhineland region of Prussia, previously under French rule. Both of\nhis parents came from Jewish families with distinguished rabbinical\nlineages. Marx\u2019s father was a lawyer who converted to\nChristianity when it became necessary for him to do so if he was to\ncontinue his legal career.\n\nFollowing an unexceptional school career, Marx studied law and\nphilosophy at the universities of Bonn and Berlin. His doctoral thesis\nwas in ancient philosophy, comparing the philosophies of nature of\nDemocritus (c.460\u2013370 BCE) and Epicurus (341\u2013270 BCE).\nFrom early 1842, he embarked on a career as a radical journalist,\ncontributing to, and then editing, the Rheinische Zeitung,\nuntil the paper was closed by the Prussian authorities in April\n1843.\n\nMarx married Jenny von Westphalen (1814\u20131881), his childhood\nsweetheart, in June 1843. They would spend their lives together and\nhave seven children, of whom just three daughters\u2014Jenny\n(1844\u20131883), Laura (1845\u20131911), and Eleanor\n(1855\u20131898)\u2014survived to adulthood. Marx is also widely\nthought to have fathered a child\u2014Frederick Demuth\n(1851\u20131929)\u2014with Helene Demuth (1820\u20131890),\nhousekeeper and friend of the Marx family.\n\nMarx\u2019s adult life combined independent scholarship, political\nactivity, and financial insecurity, in fluctuating proportions.\nPolitical conditions were such, that, in order to associate and write\nas he wished, he had to live outside of Germany for most of this time.\nMarx spent three successive periods of exile in the capital cities of\nFrance, Belgium, and England.\n",
