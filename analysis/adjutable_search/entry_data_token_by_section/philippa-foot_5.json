    "main_text": "Virtue and Morality\n6. Natural Goodness\n\nFoot\u2019s monograph Natural Goodness (2001, NG) and her\nlate essays take up a new approach to the problems she confronted\nthroughout her career. In her final published essay,\n\u201cRationality and Goodness\u201d (2004, RG), Foot discusses the\ncase of a farm boy from the Sudetenland who chose to die rather than\nto serve the\n Nazis.[8]\n In a letter to his family he writes, \n\n\nWe did not sign up for the SS, and so they condemned us to death. Both\nof us would rather die than stain our consciences with such deeds of\nhorror. (RG 2; see Gollwitzer et al. 1956) \n\n\nWith regards to this situation, Foot asks, \n\n\nWas this a rational choice? On what theory of practical\nrationality\u2014of the rationality of choices\u2014can this be made\nout? (RG 2)\n\n\nShe believes she has found a new approach that shows the Sudetenland\nboy\u2019s choice to be rational, and that it would be rational for\nany similarly situated human agent to make that choice. This\nconstitutes a second reversal of her view on this subject. In her late\nperiod, she believes that she erred in her middle period by embracing\na mistaken view of reasons for action. Her middle period view falls\ninto a category of instrumentalist theories of reasons for action. On\nsuch views, genuine reasons for action advance the fulfillment of our\ndesires or our interests. Foot came to think that these views are open\nto a serious objection that was pointed out by Warren Quinn, who\nargues that on such instrumentalist conceptions of reasons for action\nwe can be rationally shameless. These views tell us that an agent is\nrational when she acts on reasons that maximize the fulfillment of her\npreferences or interests, and it bids us to do that without regard to\ntheir content. The consequence of this view is that those with nasty\npreferences are advised by such views of practical rationality to\nmaximize the fulfillment of those preferences (Quinn 1994: 216). This\nsits awkwardly with the idea that rationality is something that is\nsupposed to guide our action.\n\nFoot proposes that we reject the demand that moral actions fit with a\npreconceived notion of practical rationality, such as a\ndesire-satisfaction conception, and, instead, we ought to adopt the\nview that moral considerations are one set of considerations that\ngenerate reasons, among others kinds of considerations that a rational\nagent must take into account (NG 11). After all, if practical\nrationality is held to be an authoritative guide to action as well as\na virtue, surely practical rationality must require an agent to take\naccount of the moral features of ends. Whether or not practical\nrationality requires taking account of those features is clearly\npertinent to whether it is a genuine virtue, much less a master\nvirtue. This argument suggests that our standards of rationality\nshould derive from our standards for goodness of the will, rather than\nthe other way around. On this view, our conception of practical\nrationality must fit within our overall conception of the human good.\nFoot believes that we can see such an approach at work in the way we\nreject present-desire theories of reasons for action. We commonly\nthink that someone who puts her future at risk for the sake of some\ntrivial, transient desire is behaving foolishly. As Foot writes, \n\n\nBeing unable to fit the supposed \u2018reason\u2019 into some\npreconceived present-desire-based theory of reasons for action, we do\nnot query whether it really is a foolish way to behave, but rather\nhang onto the evaluation and shape our theory of reasons accordingly.\n(NG 63)\n\n\nMoral reasons are of course not the only reasons to which we must\nrespond to be rational agents. Foot believes that moral\nconsiderations, such as those of justice and charity, are on par with\nself-interest and desire-fulfillment. She also believes that there are\nconsiderations of family and friendship that provide a separate\ncategory of reasons for action (RG 8\u20139). A judgment about what\nis practically rational requires weighing these various\nconsiderations, and she concludes, \u201cIt is not always rational to\ngive help where it is needed, to keep a promise, or even\u2026\nalways to speak the truth\u201d (NG 11). Hence, moral reasons are not\noverriding. For example, a soldier may lie to save himself when in the\nhands of an enemy (RG 7). Even considerations of desire fulfillment\ncan trump moral considerations, as, for example, an insignificant\npromise may be overridden by an unexpected opportunity to fulfill a\nlong-held desire.\n\nFor the case of the Sudetenland farm boy, the result of Foot\u2019s\nview is that we need not demonstrate that his decision to embrace\ndeath rather than serve the Nazis is in his best interest or serves\nhis strongest desires. Of course, there is a certain sense in which he\nwould rather die than serve the Nazis, but, as Foot points out, he\nneed not lack a strong desire to live for his action to count as\nrational. As she writes, \n\n\nIf, according to a particular theory of rationality, a good action\nsuch as his seems dubiously rational, then so much the worse, not for\nthe judgment, but rather for the theory. (RG 6) \n\n\nShe returns to the view that there are different sets of\nconsiderations that have the ability to justify and explain actions.\nIn her early work, Foot apparently appeals to intuitions about what we\ncount as reasons for action, though in her late work she adds to this\naccount a framework for assessing which considerations possess this\nindependent rationalizing status. She believes that the human will\nmust be assessed against the background of facts concerning human\nlife, especially against facts about what humans need. As Foot puts\nit, \u201cthe evaluation of human action depends\u2026 on essential\nfeatures of specifically human life\u201d (NG 14). On Foot\u2019s\nview, then, our conception of practical rationality is inevitably tied\nto what is good for human beings, and must answer to facts concerning\nwhat is good for human beings as a species. We must take certain facts\nabout the human condition into account and then we will see that these\nfacts provide the basis for a case in favor of virtues, including,\nmost importantly for Foot, justice and charity.\n\nThe leads to the second central idea of Foot\u2019s late work is that\nmoral goodness is a form of what she calls \u2018natural\ngoodness\u2019. That is, moral goodness is an aspect of what makes us\ngood as human beings. In this idea, she is developing a strain of\nthought present in some of her early writings such as \u201cGoodness\nand Choice\u201d (1961), where she defends the idea that there are\nobjective features of living things that make them good as members of\ntheir species. She argues against Hare that there is a sense of\n\u2018good cactus\u2019 that is not merely a matter of preferences\nthat we have in cacti: there are features of a good cactus that depend\non what it is to flourish as a cactus (1961 [VV 141]). That is, a blighted,\ndamaged, or otherwise unhealthy cactus is not, in this sense, a good\ncactus. This notion of \u2018natural goodness\u2019 is developed in\nher late work, where she claims that virtue makes humans good in the\nsame way that blight-free, lush green flesh in a certain shape makes a\ncactus good. The norms which determine what makes something a good\nmember of its kind she calls \u2018natural norms\u2019.\n\nIn Natural Goodness Foot makes the claim that natural norms\nare essential to the identification of anything as an organism: to\nidentify something as an organism is ipso facto to view it\nfrom a normative standpoint. We can look at an organism as an ordinary\nphysical system, but to do so is to miss its biological nature. There\nare two premises to her argument for this point: first, grasping\nsomething as an organism requires us to situate the organism against\nthe background of its species, and second, to situate an organism\nagainst the background of its species requires us to consider it from\na normative perspective. The first premise draws on Michael\nThompson\u2019s work on living things. On that account, identifying\nsomething as an organism situates it within the \u2018wider\ncontext\u2019 of its kind. As Thompson puts it, \n\n\nIf a thing is alive, if it is an organism, then some\nparticular vital operations and processes must go on in it from time\nto time\u2014eating, budding out, breathing, walking, growing,\nthinking, photosynthesizing. (Thompson 2008: 56) \n\n\nBut nothing can fall under these descriptions when understood only in\nterms appropriate to a non-living physical thing. Consider, for\nexample, the case of eating: for an organism to be regarded as eating\nsomething, one must take it to be ingesting that which is normally\nnutritious for its kind, as well as absorbing it in such a way as to\nderive nutrition from it. Otherwise, we could not say that we\nwitnessed an organism eating something, but instead we would be\nobserving a fortuitous occurrence whereby an organism takes in some\nsort of material which happens to further its life (Thompson 2008:\n57). Only against the background of a life form, which determines a\nbackground of norms for understanding the doings of an instance of\nthat form of life, can the activities of an organism be understood as\neating, or any other vital activity (Thompson 2003).\n\nOn this account, we can see that all living things exhibit, in various\nways, a special kind of agency (Thompson.2008: 43) The growth of a\nfern is essentially different from the growth of a non-living thing\nsuch as puddle of rainwater or a trash heap, as the fern brings about\nits own growth by a process of cell division. Also, we can provide a\ndescription of how such a process should advance, and recognize when\nit has gone awry, whereas there is no question of the growth of a\ntrash heap going wrong. The growth of a fern differs from that of a\nrhododendron, even though they both exhibit the same sort of agency\ncharacteristic of living things. We must, in principle, be able to\ndiscern the growth of the fern from a growth on the\nfern that is due to blight, for example, and such discernment requires\na conception of how the fern\u2019s life should progress. Hence, the\nvital operations that characterize something as an organism are\nintelligible only against the background of a life form. A particular\norganism, then, is understandable only in its relation to its species\nand how an individual of that species characteristically lives; hence,\nit involves a rudimentary identification of the thing as functionally\norganized. Note that this is a logical claim about what is involved in\nidentifying something as an organism; the existence of life forms, in\nthe sense employed by Thompson, is not a contingent fact about the\ndevelopment of the present set of living organisms, as is the\nexistence of genera and of phyla. The existence of a life form is\npresupposed whenever we identify anything as an organism, be it the\nfirst or the last of its kind.\n\nTo situate an organism against the background of the characteristic\nfunction of its kind is to consider it from a normative perspective.\nMore precisely, it is to assess that organism against what is normal\nfor organisms of its species, and in doing so we make a normative\nassessment. Of course, there are many variations that are possible\nwithin a species, and not every variation found in an individual will\ncount as a defect. As Foot points out, a blue tit can lack the patch\nof blue on its head without being hindered in living its life; this\nlack is not, then, a defect (NG 30). So, natural normativity involves\nsome recognition of the specific components that are crucial to\ncarrying out an organism\u2019s vital operations. We must note that\nto possess such insight we merely need to appreciate that the organism\nis functionally organized, which is precisely what occurs when we\nsituate an organism against the background of its species. This\nfurther implies that to consider an organism as such involves some\nrecognition (though possibly mistaken) of its needs.\n\nAs we have seen, to characterize something as possessing the agency\ndistinctive of living things requires bringing to bear norms for the\nlife form of that individual; this is no less true in our own case. Of\ncourse, humans are capable of various modes of living, and in light of\nsuch diversity, it is questionable whether there is any\ncharacteristically human life, and so, whether there is any univocal\nsense of \u2018good human\u2019. Foot acknowledges that humans are\nrational animals and she believes this characteristic introduces a\n\u2018sea change\u2019 in how we approach describing our own\nspecies; reasoning and the application of reasoning to action are\nfeatures which are evaluated in human beings. As Foot writes,\n\u201c[W]hile [non-human] animals go for the good (thing) that\nthey see, human beings go for what they see as\ngood\u201d (NG 56). We are capable of responding to reasons in a\ndistinctively explicit way, inasmuch as we act on some understanding\nof which things are good. In fact, it is precisely the application of\nreasoning to our action which interests us in ethical evaluation. Foot\nclaims that vices are defects in our responsiveness to reasons for\naction, which constitutes a sort of natural defect in humans, and,\nspecifically, individuals with vices have defective wills. Inasmuch as\nwe have the capacity to reason about how to act, we are subject to a\ndistinctive sort of evaluation; unlike other natural defects, which\nmay simply be the result of bad luck, we are responsible for our\nconception of how to act, and therefore can answer to rational\ncriticism of that conception.\n\nThus far, this view appears to build the foundations of ethics on the\nvery general characteristic of rationality, leaving aside other\naspects of our nature. If so, it will surely not advance the project\nof justifying the virtues, for such a view seems to lead us to the\nempty standard of acting in accordance with \u2018right\nreason\u2019. Yet as pointed out above, the appeal to human nature\nserves not only to tell us that we are rational, but also to\ndefine what it is to reason well. Neo-Aristotelian ethical\nnaturalism, as Foot pursues it, must be understood as a thesis\nconcerning rationality, according to which practical rationality is\nspecies-relative. Our reasoning cannot ignore what we need as human\nbeings and yet still claim to exhibit practical rationality. Hence,\nFoot can claim that as rational animals we are freed from a certain\nkind of obedience to nature, while maintaining that nature has some\nnormative role for us; nature is normative over our reasoning, but not\ndirectly over our action. Foot states that human beings strive for\nwhat we see as good rather than the good that we see, as non-human\nanimals do; she adds that what we see as good is inevitably informed\nby a conception of our form of life. Making that conception explicit\nand subjecting it to criticism is an essential part of moral reform,\nfor ethical naturalists.\n\nDespite the diversity of lives that we can choose, Foot argues that\nhuman beings are vulnerable to deprivations that parallel natural\ndefects found in plants and animals. For example, human beings need\nthe mental capacity for learning language, understanding stories,\njoining in songs, and laughing at jokes (NG 43). Foot writes:\n\n\nIn spite of the diversity of human goods\u2014the elements that can\nmake up good human lives\u2014it is therefore possible that the\nconcept of a good human life plays the same part in determining\ngoodness of human characteristics and operations that the concept of\nflourishing plays in the determination of goodness in plants and\nanimals. So far the conceptual structure seems to be intact. (NG\n44)\n\n\nHowever, it is important to realize that Foot is not saying that our\nunderstanding of good human reasoning is to be based on a morally\nneutral, biological notion of flourishing. There is a straightforward\nmisreading of Foot\u2019s naturalism that misconstrues what is\nnatural about Foot\u2019s naturalism (Andreou 2006). These\nreadings take Foot to argue that moral goodness is crucial for human\nsurvival and reproduction.\n\nFoot argues that ethical naturalism need not define the aim of\npractical reasoning in terms of promoting what an individual needs for\nsurvival and reproduction in a narrow biological sense, and she\nexplicitly claims that she is not doing so. Rather, she believes that\nwe inevitably possess an understanding of what makes for a good human\nlife that informs our understanding of good human reasoning, and good\nhuman character in general. Structurally, this is how the\nparts of a plant are deemed good with reference to the flourishing of\na plant. But Foot does not mean to suggest that the\ncontent of norms of governing human reasoning and character\nmust be pegged to a notion of lush-green-leaves-and-deep-roots\nflourishing as adapted to human terms. Certainly, there are norms\ngoverning our assessment of human health, but there are also norms\nspecifying how events are suppose to proceed when we reason and act,\nand these norms cannot be equated with what promotes human health,\nsurvival or reproduction, except insofar as these are rationally\nchosen by humans. We do not hold survival and reproduction as\nsacrosanct values and therefore it is not always rationally chosen. We\nsee this reflected by the fact that justice and other virtues may\nrequire us to forgo having children, or even to lay down our lives.\nFoot clearly has these points in mind when she says: \n\n\nLack of capacity to reproduce is a defect in a human being. But choice\nof childlessness and even celibacy is not thereby shown to be\ndefective choice, because human good is not the same as plant or\nanimal good. (NG 42)\n\n\nIt remains to ask whether the account achieves its goals when it is\nunderstood as Foot intended. Can Foot show morality to be something\nwith a foundation in human nature, as she understands it? The account\nFoot gives is promising, yet also programmatic. Foot believes that the\nmoral virtues, together with prudence and virtues like friendship and\nloyalty that pertain to human relationships are justifiable on the\nbasis of facts about human life. But which facts matter and why should\nthey matter to us? If survival and reproduction are not the touchstone\nfor human goodness, then what is? And why should we care about what is\nnaturally good for humans? These are questions that proponents of\nFoot\u2019s later views continue to pursue.\n",
