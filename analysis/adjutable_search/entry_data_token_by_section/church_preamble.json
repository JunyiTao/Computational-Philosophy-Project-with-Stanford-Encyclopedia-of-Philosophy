    "main_text": "\n\nAlonzo Church (1903\u20131995) was a renowned mathematical logician,\nphilosophical logician, philosopher, teacher and editor. He was one of\nthe founders of the discipline of mathematical logic as it developed\nafter Cantor, Frege and Russell. He was also one of the principal\nfounders of the Association for Symbolic Logic and the\nJournal of Symbolic Logic. The list of his students,\nmathematical and philosophical, is striking as it contains the names\nof renowned logicians and philosophers. In this article, we focus\nprimarily on Church\u2019s philosophical contributions. (For an\naccount of his life and academic history see the Introduction to\nThe Collected Works of Alonzo Church (2019).) However, we\nalso discuss his mathematical results when it is desirable to do so in\norder to pursue a philosophical issue. In Church\u2019s case, the\ndistinction between philosopher and formal logician/mathematician is\nnot entirely correct, since all of his work (except for the\noccasional paper on some purely mathematical subject) concerns logical\nissues in one way or another.\n\nChurch brought both the general outlook and the specific distinctions\nof formal logic to bear on philosophy in a distinctive way by applying\nhis \u201clogistic method\u201d to the philosophical topics he\ndiscussed. Conversely, he also wove certain aspects of his philosophy\ninto the fabric of formal, mathematical logic as he presented it. The\nresult was a formidable combination of philosophical vision and\nfocused argumentation. For Church, the logistic method (or\nformalization) was not only necessary to obtain additional\nclarification beyond informal discussion and to make meta-mathematical\ninvestigations possible; it was also the ideal method for dealing with\nphilosophical problems in epistemology, metaphysics and philosophy of\nlanguage. It was Church\u2019s view that one who does not aspire to\nthis ideal falls short. However, he also recognized that formalization\nis not always appropriate. He did not demand that the natural sciences\nbe formalized and even provided an informal philosophical discussion\nof semantics in the introductory chapter of his Introduction to\nMathematical Logic (1956a). The theories and arguments discussed\nin this article describe and illustrate Church\u2019s logistic\nmethod.\n\nIn the following, we often use the notational conventions that Church\nadopted from Principia Mathematica (Whitehead & Russell\n1910; hereafter PM). When we do so, these conventions are explained\nand sometimes compared with modern notation.\n",
