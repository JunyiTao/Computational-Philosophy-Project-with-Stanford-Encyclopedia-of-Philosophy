    "main_text": "The practical criterion || The Non-Rational Belief interpretation\n5.3 The Non-Rational Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe NRB view can instead deny that Arcesilaus was\npersonally committed to defending the life of universal\nsuspension against Stoic counterattack. The Stoics pointed out\nthat Arcesilaus\u2019 subversive argument for the rationality of\nuniversally suspending assent cannot be true, because it makes action,\nor at least rational and virtuous action, impossible\u2014but these\nare plainly possible (cf. Cicero Academica 2.37\u201339). But\neven if this objection did not target his own skeptical view,\nArcesilaus was bound by his method to counter it. Hence it is\nunreasonable to think that he was invested in rationalizing the life of\nthe skeptic with a theory of action (see Stopper 1983; for a\ndifferent view of the polemic, see, e.g., Ioppolo 1986, Maconi 1988,\nand Thorsrud 2009).\n6. Priority of Method\n\n\nSection 2 noted that the central question for the interpretation of\nArcesilaus\u2019 skepticism is how to reconcile his method with his\nskeptical commitments, and sections 4\u20135 set out three accounts of\nhow his commitments are compatible with his method. A further question\nrelates to the purpose of Arcesilaus\u2019 philosophical activity.\nCompeting histories of Arcesilaus\u2019 intentions in Cicero\u2019s\nAcademica offer different answers (see Allen 2018): at one\npoint Cicero suggests that Arcesilaus adopted a Socratic method\nafter he accepted inapprehensibility and\nuniversal suspension, in order to facilitate suspension of\nassent (Academica 1.44\u201345; cf. Sextus Outlines of\nPyrrhonism 1.232); but elsewhere he says that Arcesilaus\u2019\naim in questioning Zeno was to discover the truth (Academica\n2.76; cf. Cicero On the Nature of the Gods 1.11). So\nin question is whether Arcesilaus\u2019  method was\nin the service of inquiry\u2014independently of his commitments to\ninapprehensibility or universal suspension\u2014or\na revival of a Socratic methodology that only reflected skeptical\nconclusions he already reached.\n\n\nAn argument in favor of the latter is as follows (see G\u00f6rler\n1994): if Arcesilaus indeed shared the views that knowledge is\nimpossible and that holding opinions is irrational\u2014as both the\nRNB and NRB interpretations say\u2014then he could\nnot have genuinely been in the business of inquiry, which aims at\nknowledge of the truth; hence the only motivation for dialectical\nargument Arcesilaus might be left with is the promotion of\nuniversal suspension. But this argument ignores the context\nfrom which Arcesilaus\u2019 skeptical views emerged and the effects\nthey could reasonably be expected to have had on his philosophical\npractice.\n\n\nOn the RNB view, the Academic skeptic, at the start of her\nphilosophical career, inherits a rational method of inquiry, as well as\nguiding views about belief and knowledge. But her inheritance is so far\nuntested (at least by her). As she goes about putting it to work, she\nmight at first believe that her method and its norms help her to get at\nthe truth. But she then finds that by arguing in accordance with those\nnorms she is wildly successful at combatting any and all positions. She\ntherefore comes to suppose on rational grounds\u2014which may\ninclude particular arguments against Stoic cognition, the inadequacy of\nall non-skeptical theories of knowledge, and her experiences in\nargument generally\u2014that the norms cannot successfully guide her\nto truths. But she doesn\u2019t quit her life of inquiry because her\nskeptical view of the inadequacy of her method depends on that very\nmethod; it makes little sense for her to act on a view that rejects its\nown grounds. Instead she continues to inquire, now treating her\ninherited norms and guiding views about belief and knowledge only as\nhypotheses rather than as given. On the RNB view, therefore,\nArcesilaus\u2019 skepticism was self-defeating only insofar as it\ncould not justify abandoning reason.\n\n\nA similar story can be told with the NRB view. The skeptic\nlooks for the truth, on the assumption that obtaining it is of crucial\nimportance for her life. But since she consistently fails to find it,\nit begins to strike her that perhaps she never will. Perhaps, it was\nnot, after all, so important for her life to have it: maybe mere\nbelief is all we need. But it doesn\u2019t follow that she should give up\n(as false) her belief that it is irrational to hold opinions, since it\nwould only be correct to give it up if it actually is true that mere\nbelief is all she needs\u2014but this is something that her arguments\ndon\u2019t warrant, any more than they warrant the opposite\nconclusion. An NRB view, then, suggests that\nArcesilaus\u2019 beliefs in the importance of knowledge and the\ninadequacy of opinion were explicitly non-rational, in the sense that\nhe was not persuaded that they were warranted by a rational argument\nor theory, or even by the extensive arguments he devoted his life\nto. He believed that he hadn\u2019t found knowledge and that it is\nirrational to assent to anything without knowledge, but realized, as a\nresult of the unrestricted application of his Socratic method, that\nthere were strong reasons against these beliefs. He was thus not in a\nposition to give his rational assent to the belief that it is\nirrational to hold opinions\u2014he just found that that was how\nthings striked him, i.e., that\u2019s what he believed. The Academic\nskeptic, on this view, is someone whose sustained but pre-theoretical\ncommitment to rational investigation undermines her confidence in\nrationality. The result is not a negative theory\u2014e.g., the\ntheory that we can\u2019t acquire knowledge owing to the limitations of our\ncognitive or rational capacities\u2014but a pervasive lack of theory\nsustained by a dialectical method.\n\n\nIf either of these stories is correct, we don\u2019t need to deny\nArcesilaus seached for the truth, and the basic philosophical puzzle\nabout his radical skepticism is not whether it is possible to live\nwithout rational beliefs, but whether it is possible to be committed to\nrationality and yet sufficiently detached from it to recognise that,\nwhatever it is, it may not work.\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nIt is clear that any interpretation of Arcesilaus must take into\naccount both his reputation as a master dialectician who deployed\nSocrates\u2019 method ruthlessly against his philosophical\ncontemporaries, and his notorious advocacy of\ninapprehensibility and universal suspension. Given\nthe contradictory nature and scarcity of the evidence, it is perhaps\nnot surprising that modern critics do not agree about the success of\nthe \u2018dialectical\u2019 or various \u2018doctrinal\u2019\ninterpretations of Arcesilaus or about the consistency of the very\ndifferent kinds of skepticism the latter propose. But further progress\nis not ruled out, since it is open to us to offer more sophisticated\nphilosophical elaborations of those forms of skepticism and to test\ntheir historical plausibility by appealing to the diverse, but better\nattested traditions in the later Academy.",
