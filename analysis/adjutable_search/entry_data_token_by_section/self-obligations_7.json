    "main_text": "Applications || Supererogation\n6.2 Supererogation\n\nA supererogatory action is a \u201cgood deed beyond the call of\nduty\u201d (see the entry on\n supererogation).\n More precisely, it is a permissible action that is better than a\npermissible alternative. Think of friendly favors, saintly sacrifices,\nand heroic rescues.\n\nNowadays, there is not much work on the link between supererogation\nand duties to self. The standard view since the late 1970s is that\nsupererogation emerges from a clash between the greater good of others\nand raw self-interest \u2013 where self-interest is seen as a\nreasonable thing to pursue, but not as a moral obligation to oneself\n(Archer 2016a; Hurka and Shubert 2012; Parfit 1978; Scheffler 1994;\nSlote\n 1984).[5]\n\nBut in earlier work, many writers see obligations to self as\nfundamental to understanding supererogation \u2013 especially\nself-sacrifice. Jack Meiland argues that one doesn\u2019t have to\nheroically dive into the choppy waters to save others from drowning,\nthanks to a duty to oneself not to do harm; he later remarks that this\nparadox \u2013 a duty not to be a hero? \u2013\ncalls for a \u201cthorough reexamination\u201d of our views of\nsupererogation (Meiland 1964, 171). In response to Pybus (1982, 199),\nwho argues for a moral requirement to \u201cbe heroic,\u201d\nMcGoldrick objects that\n\nsuch a requirement would come into conflict with our obvious duty to\nrecognize our own intrinsic worth, and judge our own aspirations,\ngoals, and interests as no less endowed with value than the\naspirations and interests of others. (1984, 527)\n\n\n\u201cThe heart of the matter,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cis the\nKantian argument that we have duties to ourselves as well as\nothers\u201d (McGoldrick 1984, 527). Kant himself says \u201cour\nesteem\u201d for daring acts \u2013 like trying to \u201crescue\npeople from a shipwreck\u201d \u2013 will be \u201cgreatly weakened\nby the concept of duty to himself\u201d (CPrR\n5:158). The problem for Kant\u2019s view, as well as Meiland\u2019s,\nis that it seems to underrate self-sacrifice. If we owe it to\nourselves not to be the hero, won\u2019t heroism be morally\nwrong? This is an instance of the \u201cWrongness\nProblem\u201d for theories of supererogation \u2013 the problem of\nshowing why deeds that seem \u201cbeyond the call\u201d aren\u2019t\nwrong. This is the shadowy twin of the familiar \u201cObligation\nProblem,\u201d which is to explain why they aren\u2019t obligatory.\n(For early versions of the Wrongness Problem, see Mavrodes 1964 and\nNarveson 1964; see also Postow 2005).\n\nIn light of the Wrongness Problem \u2013 and with Singer\u2019s\nparadox still looming overhead \u2013 it is no surprise that some\nphilosophers began searching for something new, beyond obligations to\noneself, to be the source of the limits on moral obligations. Others\nwould give up the hunt altogether, as does Bernard Williams, a famous\nskeptic about \u201cthe morality system\u201d in general. Williams\ncalls duties to self \u201cfraudulent items,\u201d conjured up by\nphilosophers suckered in by the belief that \u201conly an obligation\ncan beat an obligation\u201d (Williams 1985, 182).\n\nNot everyone has been deterred. Some heterodox writers, working\noutside of the Kantian tradition, continue searching for a way to\nground supererogation in obligations to oneself. A notable example is\nShelly Kagan (1989, 206\u201316) and his pioneering\n\u201cSelf-Constraint Argument.\u201d Suppose \u2013 a big\n\u201csuppose\u201d \u2013 that you have the same waivable\nobligations to yourself as you do to others. Let\u2019s consider one\nsuch right; the right against yourself not to do yourself harm. From\nthis, we try to show that harming yourself for the greater good of\nothers \u2013 for example, by giving a spare kidney \u2013 will be\npurely optional. It is permissible to make the sacrifice because you\ncan just waive your obligation; the act would then be like performing\na kidney transplant on a willing donor. It is permissible not\nto self-sacrifice because you can just refuse to waive your\nobligation, which makes it wrong to self-harm; the act would then be\nlike stealing a kidney from an unwilling \u201cdonor.\u201d\nThe result is that giving your spare kidney is optional even if\nit\u2019s for the greater good: you can give yourself consent to do\nit, or refuse consent and rightfully keep the kidney. Kagan ultimately\nrejects this argument for a panoply of reasons. The other key proposal\nis due to Paul Hurley (1995), who derives the optionality of self-harm\nfrom \u201cpatient-protecting reasons,\u201d which are like\nunwaivable obligations \u2013 in this case, obligations to oneself.\nThese reasons open a \u201cprotected sphere\u201d of actions.\nMu\u00f1oz (2021) objects that Hurley\u2019s and Kagan\u2019s\narguments both struggle with the Wrongness Problem. For Hurley, the\nproblem is that a patient-protecting reason not to harm\nyourself would make it wrong to give your kidney. For Kagan, the\nsame appears to follow if you decline to\n\u201cself-consent.\u201d\n\nDespite these challenges, philosophers are still searching for links\nbetween duties to self and supererogation. Mu\u00f1oz (2021), for\nexample, tries to revive Kagan\u2019s argument, arguing that a\nwaivable duty to oneself is a prerogative: it can be cited in defense\nof one\u2019s actions, but since it can be waived at will, it\nisn\u2019t a \u201cbinding\u201d reason to comply. On this view,\nduties to self help to unify the two main concepts in deontological\nethics: restrictions, which make it wrong to harm non-consenting\nothers even for the greater good, and prerogatives, which permit us\nnot to self-harm. Restrictions come from what we owe to others, and\nprerogatives come from what we owe to ourselves.\n",
