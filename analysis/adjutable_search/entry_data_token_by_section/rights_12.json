    "main_text": "Three Approaches to the Justification of Rights || Status-Based Rights\n6.1 Status-Based Rights\n\nStatus theories belong to the tradition of natural rights theories.\nAll natural rights theories fix upon features that humans have by\ntheir nature, which make respect for certain rights appropriate. The\ntheories differ over precisely which attributes of humans give rise to\nrights, although non-religious theories tend to fix upon the same\nsorts of attributes described in more or less metaphysical or\nmoralized terms: free will, rationality, autonomy, or the ability to\nregulate one\u2019s life in accordance with one\u2019s chosen\nconception of the good life. Natural rights theorists agree that human\nreason can grasp the fact that it is appropriate to treat beings with\nsuch attributes in certain ways, although they disagree on whether\nsuch facts are self-evident.\n\nNatural rights theory reached its high point in the early modern era,\nin the work of Grotius, Hobbes, Pufendorf, and especially Locke. Locke\nargued that men have rights to \u201clife, liberty, and estate\u201d\nin a pre-political state of nature, and that these natural rights put\nlimits on the legitimate authority of the state. Locke\u2019s\ninfluence can be seen in the revolutionary American and French\npolitical documents of the eighteenth century, and especially in\nJefferson\u2019s Declaration of Independence (1776): \u201cWe hold\nthese truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that\nthey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,\nthat among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of\nHappiness.\u201d\n\nThe revival of status theory within contemporary philosophy began with\nNozick\u2019s Anarchy State and Utopia (1974). While Nozick\ndoes acknowledge a debt to Locke\u2019s theory of property, his work\nbelongs within the Kantian tradition of natural rights theorizing.\nNozick centers his explanation of the moral force of individual rights\non the Kantian imperative against treating humanity merely as a means\nto an end. Each person\u2019s rights impose side-constraints on\nothers\u2019 pursuit of their goals, Nozick says, because each person\npossesses an inviolability that all others must respect.\n\u201cIndividuals have rights,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand there are\nthings no person or group may do to them (without violating their\nrights)\u201d (Nozick 1974, ix).\n\nMany find this approach of grounding of rights in individual dignity\nappealing. There is a directness and clarity to status explanations of\nfundamental rights. For example, Kamm (2007, 247) explains the right\nof free expression as follows:\n\n\nThe right to speak may simply be the only appropriate way to treat\npeople with minds of their own and the capacity to use means to\nexpress it\u2026 Not recognizing a person\u2019s option of speaking is\nto fail to respect him\u2026 To say that any given person is not entitled\nto the strong right to free speech is\u2026 a way of saying that certain\ncrucial features of human nature are not sufficient to generate the\nright in anyone. And this seems to be a mistake.\n\n\nMoreover, status-based rights are attractively robust. While the\njustifications of instrumental rights are always contingent on\ncalculations concerning consequences, status-based rights are anchored\nfirmly in individual dignity. This makes it easy to explain why\nstatus-based rights are strong, almost unqualified rights, and this is\na position which many believe properly expresses the great value of\neach person.\n\nHowever, the strength of status-based rights can also be seen as a\nweakness of the theory. One does not wish to be carried from the great\nimportance of each individual to the implausible position that all\nfundamental rights are absolute. As Nagel (2002, 36) allows while\ndefending a status view, \u201cthere are evils great enough so that\none would be justified in murdering or torturing an innocent person to\nprevent them.\u201d Consequences, if bad enough, do justify the\nqualification of individual rights, which leaves the status theorist\nneeding to explain how a theory which rejects consequences so\nresolutely at the outset can concede their importance later on.\n\nMoreover, the simplicity of the status approach to rights can also\nappear to be a liability. On close examination, the fundamental rights\nthat most people believe in are intricately \u201cshaped.\u201d For\nexample, consider the widely-accepted right to free expression. This\nright includes the right to make damning personal attacks on others.\nYet the right is much more permissive about attacking public figures\nthan it is about assailing private citizens. How could a status\napproach explain this distinction between public figures and private\ncitizens? Or again: the right to free speech sometimes contains a\nright to say what the speaker knows to be untrue. Yet we tend to be\nmore tolerant of deceitful speech in political campaigns than we are\nof deceitful speech in advertising or in the courtroom. It is an open\nquestion whether status theory has the conceptual resources to explain\nwhy individual rights should be shaped in these specific ways.\n\nStatus theory also faces the challenge of vindicating its foundations\nand its scope. Why after all is it \u201cfitting\u201d to ascribe\nindividuals rights? The Kantian value of inviolability can look\npuzzling when presented independently of a metaphysical grounding. As\nNagel (2002, 34) admits, \u201cit has proven extremely difficult to\naccount for such a basic, individualized value such that it becomes\nmorally intelligible.\u201d This is a quiet echo of Bentham\u2019s\nprotest that the doctrine of natural rights \u201cis from beginning\nto end so much flat assertion: it lays down as a fundamental and\ninviolable principle whatever is in dispute\u201d (Bentham 1796, 66).\nCruft (2010, 451) has attempted to deepen the theory of the\nnon-instrumental value of basic rights, by showing that such rights\nare constitutive of \u201crelationships that bind all humans together\nin fellowship as members of a shared-proto-community.\u201d\n\nEven so, status theorists must also resolve an internal debate over\nexactly which rights should be thought to express an\nindividual\u2019s inviolability. Nozick holds that status-based\nrights include rights to whatever property one has acquired, while\nother status theorists reject the \u201cright libertarianism\u201d\nto which Nozick\u2019s position leads. The resolution of this debate\nbecame more urgent when a group of neo-Kantian and neo-Lockean\n\u201cleft libertarian\u201d theorists have advanced the view that\nthe status of individuals requires that each be accorded strong rights\nto self-ownership, and also initially equal shares of\n\u201cworld-ownership\u201d (Vallentyne and Steiner 2000, Otsuka\n2003). Status theories also need to pay particular attention to the\nrights that society should enforce in cases of widespread\nnon-compliance with \u201cideal\u201d rights (Quong and Stone\n2015).\n",
