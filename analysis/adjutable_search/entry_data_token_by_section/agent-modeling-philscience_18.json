The idea was first demonstrated by bandit models developed by\nZollman (2007, 2010; see\n Section 3.2)\n and came to be known as the \u201cZollman effect\u201d (Rosenstock,\nBruner, & O\u2019Connor 2017). ABMs by Grim (2009) Grim, Singer,\nFisher, and colleagues (2013), and Angere & Olsson (2017) produced\nsimilar findings based on different modeling\n frameworks.[8]\n These models show that in highly connected communities early\nerroneous results may spread quickly among scientists, leading them to\ninvestigate a sub-optimal line of inquiry. As a result, scientists may\nprematurely abandon the exploration of different hypotheses, and\ninstead exploit the inferior ones. In light of these findings, Zollman\n(2010) emphasized that for an inquiry to be successful it needs a\nproperty of \u201ctransient diversity\u201d: a process in which a\ncommunity engages in a parallel exploration of different theories,\nwhich lasts sufficiently long to prevent a premature abandonment of\nthe best theory, but which eventually gets replaced by a consensus on\nit. Besides the result that connectivity can be harmful, it has also\nbeen shown that learning in less connected networks is slower, which\nindicates a trade-off between accuracy and speed in the context of\nsocial learning (Zollman 2007; Grim, Singer, Fisher, et al. 2013).\n\nSubsequent studies showed, however, that the Zollman effect is not\nvery robust within the parameter space of the original model\n(Rosenstock et al. 2017). In particular, the result holds for those\nparameters that can be considered characteristic of difficult inquiry:\nscenarios in which there is a relatively small number of scientists,\nthe evidence is gathered in relatively small batches, and the\ndifference between the objective success of the rival hypotheses is\nrelatively small. Moreover, additional models showed that if the\ndiversity (and hence, exploration) of pursued hypotheses is generated\nin some other way, more connected communities may outperform less\nconnected ones. For instance, Kummerfeld and Zollman (2016) showed\nthat relaxing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation by\nallowing agents to occasionally gain information about the hypothesis\nthey are not currently pursuing is a way to generate diversity,\nleading a fully connected community to perform better than less\nconnected ones. Another way of generating diversity was examined by\nFrey and \u0160e\u0161elja (2020): they show that if scientists\nhave a dose of caution or \u201crational inertia\u201d when deciding\nwhether to abandon their current theory and start pursuing the rival,\na fully connected community gets a sufficient degree of exploration to\noutperform less connected groups. Similar points have been made with\nABMs based on other modeling frameworks, such as the bounded\nconfidence model by Douven and Hegselmann (2022), or an\nargumentation-based ABM by Borg, Frey, \u0160e\u0161elja, and\nStra\u00dfer (2018), each of which shows a different way of\npreserving transient diversity in spite of a high degree of\nconnectivity. \n4.2.2 The spread of disinformation\n\nABMs studying epistemically pernicious strategies in scientific\ncommunities have largely employed network epistemology bandit models\n(see\n Section 3.2).\n For instance, a model by Holman and Bruner (2015) examines how an\ninterference of industry-sponsored agents may impact the information\nflow in the medical community, and which strategies scientists could\nemploy to protect themselves from such a pernicious influence. For\nthis purpose, they consider a scenario in which medical doctors\nregularly communicate with industry-sponsored agents about the\nefficacy of a certain pharmaceutical product as a treatment for a\ngiven disease. Since the industry-sponsored agents are motivated by\nfinancial rather than epistemic interests and they are unlikely to\nchange their minds no matter how much opposing evidence they receive,\nthey are not merely biased, but \u201cintransigently biased\u201d.\nTheir simulations indicate two ways in which a scientific community\ncan protect itself from the pernicious influence of the intransigently\nbiased agent: first, by increasing their connectivity, and second, by\nlearning how to reorganize their social network on the basis of\ntrustworthiness, which leads them to eventually ignore the biased\nagent. In a follow-up model, Holman and Bruner (2017) also show how\nthe industry can bias a scientific community without corrupting any of\nthe individual scientists that compose it, but by simply helping\nindustry-friendly scientists to have successful careers.\n\nUsing a similar network-epistemology approach, Weatherall,\nO\u2019Connor and Bruner (2020) developed a bandit model to study the\n\u201cTobacco strategy\u201d, employed by the tobacco industry in\nthe second half of the twentieth century to mislead the public about\nthe negative health effects of smoking (analyzed in detail by Oreskes\n& Conway 2010). In particular, the model examines how certain\ndeceptive practices can mislead public opinion without even\ninterfering with (epistemically driven) scientific research. The\nauthors look into two such propagandist strategies: a \u201cselective\nsharing\u201d of research results that fit the industry\u2019s\npreferred position, and a \u201cbiased production\u201d of research\nresults where additional research gets funded, but only suitable\nfindings get published. The results show that both strategies are\neffective in misleading policymakers about the scientific output under\nvarious examined parameters since in both cases the policymakers\nupdate their beliefs on the basis of a biased sample of results,\nskewed towards the worse theory. The authors also look into strategies\nemployed by journalists reporting on scientific findings and show that\nincautiously aiming to be \u201cfair\u201d by reporting an equal\nnumber of results from both sides of the controversy may result in the\nspread of misleading information.\n\nAnother example of ABMs developed to examine deception in science is\nan argumentation-based model by Borg, Frey, \u0160e\u0161elja, and\nStra\u00dfer (2017, 2018; see\n Section 3.1.3).\n Assuming the context of rival research programs where scientists have\nto identify the best out of three available ones, deceptive\ncommunication is represented in terms of agents sharing only positive\nfindings about their theory, while withholding news about potential\nanomalies. The underlying idea is that deception consists in providing\nsome (true) information while at the same time withholding other\ninformation, which leads the receiver to make a wrong inference\n(Caminada 2009). Unlike the previous two models discussed in this\nsection, where not all agents display biased or deceptive behavior,\nBorg et al. study network effects in a population consisting entirely\nof deceptive scientists. Such a scenario represents a community that\nis driven, for instance, by confirmation bias and an incentive to\nshield one\u2019s research line from critical scrutiny. The\nsimulations show that, first, reliable communities (consisting of no\ndeceivers) are significantly more successful than the deceptive ones,\nand second, increasing the connectivity makes it more likely that\ndeceptive populations converge on the best theory.\n4.3 Cognitive diversity\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 2.1,\n the problem of cognitive diversity concerns the relation between the\ndiversity of cognitive features of scientists (including their\nbackground beliefs, reasoning styles, research preferences, heuristics\nand strategies) and the inquiry of the scientific community.\nPhilosophers of science have especially been interested in how the\ndivision of labor across different research heuristics impacts the\nperformance of the community.\n\nA particularly influential ABM tackling this issue is the epistemic\nlandscape model by Weisberg and Muldoon (2009). The model examines the\ndivision of labor catalyzed by different research strategies, where\nscientists can act as the \u201ccontrols\u201d,\n\u201cfollowers\u201d or \u201cmavericks\u201d (see above\n Section 3.1).\n In view of the simulations, Weisberg and Muldoon argue that, first,\nmavericks outperform other research strategies. Second, if we consider\nthe maverick strategy to be costly in terms of the necessary\nresources, then introducing mavericks to populations of followers can\nlead to an optimal division of labor. While Weisberg and\nMuldoon\u2019s ABM eventually turned out to include a coding error\n(Alexander et al. 2015), their claim that cognitive diversity improves\nthe productivity of scientists received support from adjusted versions\nof the model, albeit with some qualifications.\n\nFirst, Thoma\u2019s (2015) model showed that cognitively diverse\ngroups outperform homogeneous ones if scientists are sufficiently\nflexible to change their current approach and sufficiently informed\nabout the research conducted by others in the community. Second,\nP\u00f6yh\u00f6nen (2017) confirmed that if we consider the maverick\nstrategy to be slightly more time-consuming, mixed populations of\nmavericks and followers may outperform communities consisting only of\nmavericks in terms of the average epistemic significance of the\nobtained results. According to P\u00f6yh\u00f6nen, another condition\nthat needs to be satisfied if cognitive diversity is to be beneficial\nconcerns the topology of the landscape: diverse populations outperform\nhomogeneous ones only in case of more challenging inquiries\n(represented in terms of rugged epistemic landscapes), but not in case\nof easy research problems (represented by landscapes such as Weisberg\nand Muldoon\u2019s one,\n Figure 2).\n The importance of the topology of the landscape was also emphasized\nby Alexander and colleagues (2015) who use NK-landscapes to show that\nwhether social learning is beneficial or not crucially depends on the\nlandscape\u2019s topology. Finally, there are other research\nstrategies (such as Alexander and colleagues\u2019\n\u201cswarm\u201d one, see\n Section 3.1.1)\n that outperform Weisberg and Muldoon\u2019s mavericks, while small\nchanges in the follower strategy may significantly improve its\nperformance (Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto & Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto\n2018).\n\nAnother aspect of cognitive diversity that received attention in the\nmodeling literature concerns the relationship between diversity and\nexpertise. This issue was first studied in economics by Hong and Page\n(2004). The model examined how heuristically diverse groups,\nconsisting of agents with diverse problem-solving approaches, compare\nwith groups consisting solely of experts with respect to finding a\nsolution to a particular problem. Hong and Page\u2019s original\nresult suggested that \u201cdiversity trumps ability\u201d in the\nsense that groups consisting of individuals employing diverse\nheuristic approaches outperfom groups consisting solely of experts,\nthat is, agents who are the best \u201cproblem-solvers\u201d. While\nthis finding became quite influential, subsequent studies showed that\nit does not hold robustly once more realistic assumptions about\nexpertise are added to the model (Grim, Singer, Bramson, et al. 2019;\nReijula & Kuorikoski 2021; see also Singer 2019).\n\nThe problem of cognitive diversity and the division of labor in\nscientific communities was also studied by Hegselmann and\nKrause\u2019s bounded-confidence model (Hegselmann & Krause 2006;\nsee above\n Section 3.3).\n The ABM examines opinion dynamics in a community that is diverse in\nthe sense that only some individuals are active truth seekers, while\nothers adjust their beliefs by exchanging opinions with those agents\nwho have sufficiently similar beliefs to their own. Hegselmann and\nKrause investigate conditions under which such a community can reach\nconsensus on the truth, combining agent-based modeling and analytical\nmethods. They show that, on the one hand, if all agents in the model\nare truth seekers, they achieve a consensus on the truth. On the other\nhand, if the community divides labor, its ability to reach a consensus\non the truth will depend on the number of truth seeking agents, the\nposition of the truth relative to the agents\u2019 opinions, the\ndegree of confidence determining the scope of opinion exchange and the\nrelative weight of the truth signal (in contrast to the weight of\nsocial information). For instance, under certain parameter settings\neven a single truth-seeking agent will lead the rest of the community\nto the truth.\n4.4 Social diversity\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 2.4,\n ABMs were introduced to study two issues that concern social\ndiversity in the context of science: first, epistemic effects of\nsocially diverse scientific groups, and second, factors that can\nundermine social diversity or disadvantage members of minorities in\nscience.\n\nConcerning the former question, Fazelpour and Steel (2022) developed a\nnetwork epistemology bandit model (see\n Section 3.2)\n to study effects of social (or demographic) diversity on collective\ninquiry. The model examines how different degrees of trust between\nsocially distinct sub-groups impact the performance of the scientific\ncommunity. The simulations show that social diversity can improve\ngroup inquiry by reducing the excessive trust scientists may place in\neach other\u2019s findings. This is particularly relevant in cases of\ndifficult inquiry in tightly connected communities, where a high\ndegree of trust may lead to a premature endorsement of an objectively\nfalse hypothesis. The authors also demonstrate how social diversity\ncan counteract negative effects of conformity in the choice of\nresearch paths, under the condition that the tendency to conform\nisn\u2019t too high. Using a similar bandit framework, Wu (2023)\nexamines how a marginalized group learns in environments in which\nmembers of the dominant group ignore or devalue results coming from\nthe former. She shows that in such situations, members of the\nmarginalized group can achieve an epistemic advantage in the sense of\nforming more accurate beliefs than the members of the dominant group.\nIn this way, the model aims to explain the \u201cinversion\nthesis\u201d from standpoint epistemology, according to which\nmarginalized groups may have an epistemically privileged status (Wylie\n2003).\n\nWith regard to the latter question, we previously mentioned the model\nby Rubin and Schneider (2021), which shows how minority members can\nbecome disadvantaged due to the priority rule in science and the\nstructure of the scientific community\n (Section 4.1).\n In a follow-up model, Rubin (2022) demonstrates how the\norganizational structure of the scientific community can also\ninfluence the emergence of \u201ccitation gaps\u201d, where\npublications by members of underrepresented and minority groups are\ncited less than those by members of the majority. The impact of one\u2019s\nminority status on one\u2019s position in scientific collaborations was\nmainly studied by means of evolutionary game-theoretic models of\nbargaining (see\n Section 3.4).\n The models show different ways in which minorities can become\ndiscriminated against merely due to their minority status and the\nimpact of such a status on the bargaining and collaborative practices\n(Rubin & O\u2019Connor 2018; O\u2019Connor & Bruner 2019;\nVentura 2023). Moreover, the results show that such an outcome may\nhave a negative impact on scientific progress, and it may help to\nexplain why gender and racial minorities tend to cluster in academic\nsubdisciplines (O\u2019Connor & Bruner 2019; Rubin &\nO\u2019Connor 2018). We will revisit these models below in\n Section 4.7,\n devoted to the issue of scientific collaboration.\n4.5 Peer-disagreement in science\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 2.5,\n peer disagreement debate highlighted different norms that can guide\nscientists. ABMs were introduced to examine the impact of these norms\non the communal inquiry. To this end, Douven (2010) and De Langhe\n(2013) enhanced the bounded confidence model by Hegselmann and Krause\n(2006; see\n Section 3.3)\n to study the impact of the Conciliatory and Steadfast Norms on the\ngoals of\n inquiry.[9]\n\n\nBoth models suggest that the impact of these norms is context\ndependent. In Douven\u2019s model, when data received through inquiry\nis not very noisy\u2014in the sense that it is indicative of the\ntruth rather than resulting from measurement errors\u2014conciliating\npopulations will be faster in discovering the truth than the steadfast\nones. Nevertheless, if the data becomes noisy, the simulations show a\ntrade-off between accuracy and speed. While steadfast populations get\nwithin a moderate distance of the truth relatively quickly, they\ndon\u2019t improve their accuracy in the subsequent rounds of the\nsimulation. In contrast, conciliating populations end up closer to the\ntruth but it takes them relatively longer to do so. This indicates\nthat whether a norm is optimal for the communal goals may largely\ndepend on contextual issues of inquiry, such as obtaining noise-free\nevidence. De Langhe comes to a similar conclusion, using a model that\nrepresents longstanding scientific disagreements and an inquiry\ninvolving multiple rivaling epistemic systems. The model is inspired\nby Goldman\u2019s (2010) idea that even though disagreeing peers may\nshare the evidence concerning the issue in question, they may not\nshare the evidence for the epistemic system within which they evaluate\nthe former kind of evidence. His simulations suggest that while\nconciliating within one\u2019s epistemic system is beneficial, that\nis not the case when it comes to disagreements between different\nepistemic\n systems.[10]\n\n4.6 Scientific polarization\n\nThe initial work on ABMs of polarization in scientific communities is\nbased on Hegselmann and Krause\u2019s bounded confidence model\n(Hegselmann & Krause 2006; see\n Section 3.3).[11]\n The model shows that a community can polarize when some agents form\ntheir opinions by disregarding the evidence coming from the world and\nby instead taking into account only what they learn from others, who\nhave sufficiently similar views. Subsequent models, based on different\nframeworks, sought to examine whether polarization can emerge even if\nall agents are truth-seekers, that is, rational agents who form their\nopinions only in view of epistemic considerations.\n\nFor example, a model by Singer et al. (2019) shows the emergence of\npolarization in groups of deliberating agents who share reasons for\ntheir beliefs, and who merely use a coherence-based approach to manage\ntheir limited memory (by forgetting those reasons that conflict with\nthe view supported by most of their previous considerations). Using\nthe Bayesian modeling framework Laputa, Olsson (2013) shows how\npolarization can emerge over the course of deliberation if agents\nassign different degrees of trust to the testimony of others,\ndepending on how similar views they hold. In another Bayesian\nframework based on bandit models, O\u2019Connor and Weatherall (2018)\nshow how a community of scientists who share not only their testimony,\nbut unbiased evidence, can end up in a polarized state if they treat\nevidence obtained by other scientists, whose beliefs are too far off\nfrom their own, as uncertain. Moreover, Michelini, Osorio and\ncolleagues (forthcoming) combine bandit models with the\nbounded-confidence framework to study polarization in communities that\ndisagree on the diagnostic value of evidence for a certain hypothesis\n(modeled by the Bayes factor). Their results indicate that an initial\ndisagreement on the diagnosticity of evidence can lead to\npolarization, depending on the sample size of the performed studies\nand the confidence interval within which scientists share their\nopinions.\n\nPolarization in epistemic communities has also been studied by ABMs\nsimulating argumentative dynamics. For example, using the framework by\nBetz (2013), Kopecky (2022) proposes a model that shows how certain\nways in which rational agents engage in argumentative exchange in an\nopen debate forum can result in polarized communities, even if agents\ndon\u2019t have a preference for whom they argue with.\n4.7 Scientific collaboration\n\nAs discussed in\n Section 2.7,\n ABMs have been used to study when collaborating is beneficial and how\nit impacts inquiry. To examine why collaborations emerge and when they\nare beneficial, Boyer-Kassem and Imbert (2015) developed a\ncomputational model in which scientists collaborate by sharing\nintermediate results. They study collaborative groups in a larger\ncompetitive community, driven by the priority rule, where\ncollaborators have to equally share the reward for making a discovery.\nTheir simulations suggest that collaborating is beneficial both for\ncommunal and individual inquiry. When scientists collaborate, they\nproceed faster with their inquiry, making it more likely that they\nwill belong to a team that is first to make a discovery. Moreover,\nwhile the scientific community may profit from all scientists fully\ncollaborating (since solutions found by some scientists will be shared\nwith everyone), for individual scientists other collaborative\nconstellations may be better (see also Boyer-Kassem & Imbert\nforthcoming). \n\nTo examine conditions for optimal collaboration Zollman (2017)\nproposed a network-epistemology model. The model starts from the\nassumption that by collaborating scientists teach each other different\nconceptual schemes aimed at solving scientific problems, and that\ncollaboration comes at a cost. His findings suggest that reducing the\ncosts of collaborations and enlarging the size of the collaborative\ngroup benefits those involved, though encouraging scientists to engage\nwith different collaborative groups may not lead to efficient\ninquiry.\n\nWhile the above models studies socially uniform communities, ABMs have\nalso been employed to study socially diverse collaborative\nenvironments and discriminatory patterns that can endogenously emerge\nin them. These models are typically based on evolutionary\ngame-theoretic frameworks examining bargaining norms that accompany\nacademic collaborations (see\n Section 3.4).\n Bruner (2019) initially used this framework to show that in cultural\ninteractions involving a division of resources, minority members can\nbecome disadvantaged merely due to the smaller size of their\n group.[12]\n O\u2019Connor and Bruner (2019) use this approach to study the\nemergence of similar patterns in epistemic communities. The\nsimulations show that minorities can become disadvantaged in\nscientific collaborations due to the size of their group, where the\neffect is increased the smaller their group is. Rubin and\nO\u2019Connor (2018) use a similar framework to examine diversity and\ndiscrimination in epistemic collaboration networks, with a special\nfocus on the role of homophily\u2014the tendency to preferentially\nestablish links with members of one\u2019s own social group in\ncontrast to members of the outgroup. Their results suggest that\ndiscriminatory norms, likely to emerge in academic interaction, may\npromote homophily and decrease social diversity in collaborative\nnetworks. Furthermore, Ventura (2023) shows how inequality can emerge\nin collaboration networks even in the absence of demographic\ncategories since scientists can become disadvantaged merely due to the\nstructure of the collaboration network and their specific position in\nit.\n4.8 Additional themes\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 2.8,\n ABMs have been applied to the study of many additional themes in\nphilosophy of science: the problem of allocating funding to research\ngrants (Harnagel 2019; Avin 2019a,b), examining Popperian and Kuhnian\nmodels of scientific progress (De Langhe 2014a), the dynamics of\nnormal and revolutionary science (De Langhe 2017), pluralism of\nscientific methods (Currie & Avin 2019), the impact of methods\nguiding research design and data analysis on the quality of scientific\nfindings (Smaldino & McElreath 2016), strategic behavior of\nscientists as a motivated exchange of beliefs (Merdes 2021),\njournals\u2019 publishing strategies (Zollman 2009), meta-inductive\nlearning (Schurz 2009, 2012), the impact of evidential strength on the\naccuracy of scientific consensus (Santana 2018), the management and\nstructure of scientific groups (Sikimi\u0107 & Herud-Sikimi\u0107\n2022), the reliability of testimonial norms, which guide how one\nshould change beliefs in light of others\u2019 claims (Mayo-Wilson\n2014), the assessment of source reliability (Merdes, Von Sydow, &\nHahn 2021), the impact of \u201cepistemic stubbornness\u201d as an\nunwillingness to change one\u2019s scientific stance in face of\ncountervailing evidence (Santana 2021), the impact of different\ntheory-choice evaluations on the efficiency of inquiry (Borg et al.\n2019), and so forth.\n5. Epistemology of Agent-Based Modeling\n\nIn the previous section we delved into various results obtained by\nmeans of agent-based modeling. But how seriously should we take each\nof these findings? What exactly do they tell us about science? Given\nthat one of the main cognitive functions of models in science is to\nhelp us to learn about the world (cf. the entry on\n models in science),\n this raises the question: what exactly can we learn with ABMs, and\nwhich methodological steps do we have to follow to acquire such\nknowledge? These issues are a matter of the epistemology of\nagent-based\n modeling.[13]\n\n5.1 The challenge of abstract modeling\n\nIn an early discussion on simulations in social sciences, Boero and\nSquazzoni (2005) proposed a classification of ABMs into case-based\nmodels, typifications, and theoretical abstractions\u2014based on the\nproperties of the represented target. While a case-based model\nrepresents an empirical scenario that is delineated in time and space,\ntypifications represent classes of empirical phenomena. Finally,\ntheoretical abstractions, as their name suggests, abstract away from\nvarious features of empirical targets and aim at simplified and\ngeneral representation of social phenomena.\n\nFollowing the tradition of abstract ABMs in social sciences, the\nmajority of simulations in philosophy of science have been developed\nwithin the so-called \u201cKISS\u201d (Keep it Simple,\nStupid)\n approach.[14]\n As such, they belong to the third type of ABMs listed above. The main\nadvantage of constructing simple models is that they allow for an\neasier understanding of the represented causal mechanisms than complex\nmodels do. However, this also raises the question: what can we learn\nfrom these models about real science, given their highly idealized\ncharacter? For instance, do results of such simulations increase our\nunderstanding of scientific communities? Can we use them to provide\npotential explanations of certain episodes from the history of\nscience, or to formulate normative recommendations for how scientific\ninquiry should be organized? These questions have been a matter of\nphilosophical debate, closely related to the discussion on the\nepistemic function of highly idealized or toy-models across empirical\n sciences.[15]\n In particular, critics have argued that if abstract ABMs are to be\ninformative of empirical targets, they first need to be verified and\nempirically validated.\n5.2 Verification and validation: from exploratory to explanatory functions of ABMs\n\nIn the context of agent-based modeling, verification is a method of\nevaluating the accuracy of the computer program underlying an ABM\nrelative to its conceptual design. Validation, on the other hand,\nconcerns the evaluation of the link between the model and its\npurported target. Irrespective of the purpose for which the model was\nbuilt, it always requires some degree of verification to ensure that\nits simulation code does not suffer from bugs and other unintended\nissues. The type of required validation depends on the purpose of the\nmodel and its intended target. As Mayo-Wilson and Zollman (2021) have\nargued, validation isn\u2019t always necessary for some modeling\npurposes, such as illustrating that certain events or situations are\ntheoretically possible. Models can instead be justified by\n\u201cplausibility arguments\u201d and in view of stylized\nhistorical case studies. According to Mayo-Wilson and Zollman, ABMs\nplay a role analogous to thought experiments in that they can be used\nto evoke normative intuitions, to justify counterfactual claims, to\nillustrate possibilities and impossibilities, and so on. Moreover,\nwhen it comes to questions concerning the dynamics of social systems,\nthey are more apt for the task than mere thought experiments due to\nthe complexity of such target phenomena.\n\nEmpirical validation is also not required if the function of an ABM is\nto provide a proof-of-concept or a how-possibly explanation. A model\nprovides a proof-of-concept (sometimes also called a\n\u201cproof-of-possibility\u201d or\n\u201cproof-of-principle\u201d) if it merely demonstrates a\ntheoretical possibility of a certain phenomenon (cf. Arnold 2008). The\ntarget phenomenon may be represented in an abstract, idealized way,\ndisregarding the empirical adequacy of the modeling assumptions.\nGelfert (2016: 85\u201386) distinguishes two specific functions of\nthe proof-of-concept modeling. First, a model may exemplify how an\napproach or methodology can generate a potential representation of a\ngiven target phenomenon. For instance, if an ABM shows how the\nframework of epistemic landscapes can be used to represent cognitive\ndiversity, it provides a proof-of-concept in this sense of the term.\nSecond, a model may provide results showing that a certain causal\nmechanism can be found within the model-world. For instance, if a\nhighly idealized simulation shows that a certain kind of cognitive\ndiversity results in efficient inquiry of the modeled community, it\nprovides a proof-of-concept in the latter sense. While\nproof-of-concept modeling is sometimes taken to be just a preliminary\nstep in the development of more realistic models (see for instance\nGr\u00e4bner 2018), it has also been considered as providing valuable\nphilosophical insights already on its own (see for example\n\u0160e\u0161elja 2021a).\n\nSimilarly, simulations provide how-possibly explanations\n(HPEs) if they show how a certain target phenomenon can possibly\nresult from certain preconditions (Rosenstock et al. 2017;\nGr\u00e4bner 2018; Frey & \u0160e\u0161elja 2018;\n\u0160e\u0161elja 2022b). In contrast to how-actually\nexplanations, or explanations simpliciter, which are accounts of how\nphenomena actually occur, HPEs (sometimes also called \u201cpotential\nexplanations\u201d) cover accounts of possible ways in which\nphenomena can\n occur.[16]\n According to a broad reading of the notion proposed by\nVerreault-Julien (2019), HPEs are propositions that have the form\n\u201cIt is possible that \u2018p because q\u2019.\u201d, where\np is the explanandum, q the explanans, and the\npossibility may refer to various types of modalities such as\nepistemic, logical, causal, and so forth.\n\nThe above epistemic functions\u2014providing a proof-of-concept or an\nHPE\u2014are often considered a kind of exploratory modeling, where\nthe represented target can be an abstract, theoretical phenomenon\n(Ylikoski & Aydinonat 2014; \u0160e\u0161elja 2021a). In\ncontrast, to provide explanations of empirical phenomena, many have\nargued that ABMs need to be empirically validated. This has been\nemphasized as important in case models are supposed to explain certain\npatterns from actual scientific practice, to provide evidence\nsupporting existing empirical (including historical) hypotheses, or to\nprovide suggestions for interventions through science policy (Arnold\n2014; Martini & Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto 2017; Thicke 2020;\n\u0160e\u0161elja 2021a).\n\nValidation of ABMs consists in examining whether the model is a\nreasonable representation of the target, where\n\u201creasonable\u201d may refer to different aspects of the model\n(Gr\u00e4bner 2018). For instance, we may test how well mechanisms\nrepresented in the model conform to our empirical knowledge about\nthem, whether the exogenous inputs for the model are empirically\nplausible, to what extent the output of the model replicates existing\nknowledge about the target, or whether it can predict its future\nstates. Different authors have suggested different elaborations of\nthese points with respect to ABMs in philosophy of science (see Thicke\n2020; \u0160e\u0161elja 2022b; Bedessem 2019; Politi 2021; Pesonen\n2022).\n\nWhile some of these steps may be challenging, others may be more\nfeasible. For instance Martini and Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto (2017) argue\nthat ABMs of science can be calibrated on empirical data. Harnagel\n(2019) exemplifies how this could be done by calibrating an epistemic\nlandscape model with bibliometric data.\n\nOthers have argued that results of simulations should at least be\nanalyzed in terms of their robustness. Robustness analysis\n(RA) includes: \n\n parameter RA, examining the stability of results with respect to\nchanges in parameter values of the model, usually studied by means of\nsensitivity\n analysis;[17]\n\n structural RA, which focuses on the stability of results under\nchanges in structural features of the model and its underlying\nassumptions; \n representational RA, which studies the stability of the results\nwith respect to changes in the representational framework, modelling\ntechnique, or modelling medium (Weisberg 2013: Chapter 9; Houkes,\n\u0160e\u0161elja, & Vaesen forthcoming).\n\n\nThe main purpose of RA in the context of ABMs is to help with\nunderstanding conditions (in the model world) under which results of\nthe model hold: whether they depend on specific parameter values or on\nspecific assumptions about the causal factors involved in the\nrepresented target, or whether the result is just an artifact of\ncertain idealizing assumptions in the model. This can benefit our\nunderstanding of the model and its results in at least two ways. On\nthe one hand, if an RA shows that the result holds under various\nchanges in parameter values, structural and representational\nassumptions, this may increase our confidence that the result is not a\nmere artifact of idealizations in the model (see, e.g., Kuorikoski,\nLehtinen, & Marchionni\n 2012).[18]\n On the other hand, if the result holds only for specific parameter\nvalues or under specific structural or representational assumptions,\nthis can help to delineate the context of application of the model\n(for example, the context of difficult inquiry, the context of inquiry\ninvolving a small scientific community, and so on).\n5.3 The \u201cfamily of models perspective\u201d\n\nThe importance of robustness analysis suggests that determining the\nepistemic function of a single ABM in isolation may be difficult. In\norder to assess whether the results of an ABM are explanatory of a\ncertain empirical target, it is useful to check whether they are\nrobust under changes in the idealizing modeling assumptions. One way\nto do so is to construct a new model by replacing some assumptions in\nthe previous one. Moreover, using a model based on an entirely\ndifferent representational framework may additionally help in such\nrobustness studies. This is why the value of using multiple models to\nstudy the same research question has been increasingly emphasized in\nthe modeling literature.\n\nFor instance, Aydinonat, Reijula, and Ylikoski (2021) have argued for\nthe importance of the \u201cfamily-of-models perspective\u201d. The\nauthors consider models as argumentative devices, where an argument\nsupported by a given model can be strengthened by means of analyses\nbased on subsequent models. The approach according to which phenomena\nshould be studied by means of multiple models has also been endorsed\nin the broader context of modeling in social sciences (cf. Page 2018;\nKuhlmann 2021).\n\nIn sum, even though ABMs in philosophy of science tend to be highly\nidealized, they can have exploratory roles, such as identifying\npossible causal mechanisms underlying scientific inquiry, offering\nhow-possibly explanations, or providing conjectures and novel\nperspectives on historical case-studies (cf. \u0160e\u0161elja\n2022a). In addition, they can play more challenging epistemic roles\n(such as providing explanations of empirical phenomena or evidence for\nempirical hypotheses) if accompanied by validation procedures, which\nmay benefit from looking into classes of models aimed at the same\ntarget phenomenon.\n6. Conclusion and Outlook\n\nThis entry has provided an overview of applications of agent-based\nmodeling to issues studied by philosophers of science. Since such\napplications are primarily concerned with social aspects of scientific\ninquiry, ABMs in philosophy of science are mainly developed within the\nsubfield of formal social epistemology of science. While agent-based\nmodeling has experienced rapid growth in this domain, it remains to\nstand the test of time. In particular, foundational issues concerning\nthe epistemic status of abstract models and their methodological\nunderpinnings (for instance, the KISS vs. the KIDS approach, see\n footnote 14)\n remain open. Having said that, theoretical achievements made with the\nexisting models have been remarkable and they provide a firm ground\nfor further growth of agent-based modeling as a philosophical\nmethod.\n\nOne avenue that has received relatively little attention is the\ncombination of agent-based modeling and empirical methods. Although\nearly philosophical discussions on ABMs emphasized the fruitful\ncombination of experimental and computational methods (see, e.g.,\nHartmann, Lisciandra, & Machery 2013), this area has not been\nexplored extensively, leaving ample opportunities for future research.\nFor instance, highly idealized ABMs can benefit from validation in\nterms of experimental studies (as exemplified by Mohseni et al. 2021).\nMoreover, qualitative research, such as ethnographic studies of\nscientific communities, can help to empirically inform assumptions\nused to build models (see, e.g., Ghorbani, Dijkema, & Schrauwen\n2015).\n\nAnother emerging line of inquiry comes from the recent developments in\nartificial intelligence. In particular, big data and machine-learning\nmodels can be a fruitful way of generating input for ABMs, such as the\nbehavior of agents (see, e.g., Kavak, Padilla, Lynch, & Diallo\n2018; Zhang, Valencia, & Chang 2023). For instance, natural\nlanguage processing technology has been used to represent agents who\nexpress their arguments in terms of natural language (Betz 2022). Such\nenhancements provide novel opportunities for highly idealized models:\nfrom their robustness analyses in which certain assumptions are\nde-idealized to the exploration of novel questions and phenomena.",
