    "main_text": "Equality of Opportunity\u2014Constraint or State of Affairs\n1. Equality of Opportunity\u2014Constraint or State of Affairs\n\nThe essentials of Equality of Opportunity are most clearly illustrated\nthrough a contrast with Equality of Outcome (for critical reflections\non the contrast see Joseph 1980; Phillips 2004; Strauss 1992).\nAccording to an everyday understanding, the notion of Equality of\nOutcome entails that people should receive the same amount of some\ngood or goods, or enjoy the same rank or status, and deviations are\nalways bad. Whilst \u201cEquality\u201d as an ideal has profound\nsocio-political resonance in popular consciousness, it is\ncomparatively rare to see Equality of Outcome receive an explicit\ndefence (see Tawney 1931, for a forthright defence from the recent\npast). Dworkin (2000: 2) goes further and suggests that not only is\nEquality of Outcome unlikely to seem like a serious political ideal to\nanyone, but there is nothing to be said for it whatsoever (but, see\nPhillips 2004, who defends Equality of Outcome between groups as an\nindicator for Equality of Opportunity between individuals). In\ncontrast, the ideal of Equality of Opportunity commands far more\nwidespread support (Swift 2014: 102; Temkin 2016. For a critique see\nCavanagh 2002). Under Equality of Opportunity differences in outcome\nare justifiable, provided that individuals enjoy the\n\u201copportunity\u201d for the good or rank in the relevant sense\n(for critical reflections on this thought, see Chambers 2009).\n\nEquality of Opportunity can be \u201ccompetitive\u201d in that it\nrefers to a process by which persons compete for a good where some\npersons\u2019 successful pursuit of the good will mean that others\nfail\u2014such as prospective employees applying for a job (for\nemphasis on this facet, see Jacobs 2004). Less commonly, it can be\n\u201cnon-competitive\u201d in that it refers to cases where\npersons\u2019 enjoyment of the good does not directly depend on\nwhether others attain it\u2014such as eligibility for unemployment\nbenefit (see Sreenivasan 2014 for some reflections on how Equality of\nOpportunity is sometimes ambiguous between the two)\n\nThe term Equality of Opportunity can be understood in two broadly\ndifferent, albeit related, ways, which are sometimes combined in\nparticular accounts (for work drawing attention to these broad\ndifferences see Mason 2006; Holmes 2005; Radcliffe Richards 1997:\n265\u2013268) First, Equality of Opportunity is primarily seen as a\nconstraint on selection or distribution decisions for scarce positions\nor goods. For example, it might be claimed that Equality of\nOpportunity prohibits race and gender discrimination in employment\nhiring decisions, to provide applicants with the due consideration\nthey are owed in the process. Here Equality of Opportunity is\nunderstood in terms of permissible and impermissible criteria\ndetermining the allocation of positions. Second, Equality of\nOpportunity is seen as a social ideal concerning the structure of\nsociety as a whole concerning which factors should play a role in\ndetermining how well people fare, perhaps in comparison with one\nanother. For example, it might be claimed a society manifests Equality\nof Opportunity only when social class does not hinder a person\u2019s\noverall prospects for success. Here Equality of Opportunity is\nunderstood as a quality of the social order, rather than a feature of\nselection procedures.\n\nThe basic difference between these respective ways of thinking about\nEquality of Opportunity is that the former focuses primarily on the\nway allocative and selective decisions ought to be made and which\ncriteria should inform those decisions, whereas the latter focuses\nprimarily on whether people enjoy Equality of Opportunity as an\noverall state of affairs. In line with a broad distinction drawn in\nthe context of conceptions of equality more generally, we might call\nthe former \u201cdeontic\u201d conceptions of Equality of\nOpportunity and the latter \u201ctelic\u201d conceptions of Equality\nof Opportunity (see Holmes 2005, for exploration of further\ncomplexities).\n\nDespite the general difference between deontic and telic ideas of\nEquality of Opportunity, the distinction between these ways of\nthinking about Equality of Opportunity should not be overdrawn. Both\nways of thinking about Equality of Opportunity focus on the factors\nwhich are relevant or irrelevant to the determination of the\nattainment of advantages but are different to the extent that one\nrelates this to the quality of a decision-making process, and the\nother relates this to the broader distributive profile of society.\nMoreover, the deontic and telic views may be connected in several\nways. For instance, one might hold a deontic view of Equality of\nOpportunity that prohibits sex discrimination in hiring precisely\nbecause prohibiting sex discrimination is judged necessary to\ninstantiate a version of telic Equality of Opportunity, under which\nno-one suffers generally lower social prospects because of their sex\n(for a view that links the wrongfulness of discrimination to Equality\nof Opportunity see Segall 2013). One might also hold that a given\ndeontic view of Equality of Opportunity is conditional on some form of\ntelic Equality of Opportunity. For instance, in university selection\nprocesses, one might hold that it is appropriate to select the best\nqualified candidates (a deontic version of Equality of Opportunity)\nonly when all candidates have enjoyed relevantly equal\nopportunities to achieve qualifications (a telic version of Equality\nof Opportunity) (Clayton 2012: 421). See\n section 10\n below for further discussion.\n",
