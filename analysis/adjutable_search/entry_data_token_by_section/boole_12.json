    "main_text": "Later Developments || Objections to Boole\u2019s Algebra of Logic\n5.1 Objections to Boole\u2019s Algebra of Logic\n\nMany objections to Boole\u2019s system have been published over the years;\nfour among the most important concern:\n\nthe dependency on Common Algebra,\nthe use of uninterpretable expressions in derivations,\nthe treatment of particular propositions by equations, and\nthe method of dealing with division.\n\n\nFor example, Boole\u2019s use of \\(v\\) in the\nequational expression of propositions has been a long-standing bone of\ncontention. \nErnst Schr\u00f6der (1841\u20131902) \nargued in Volume II of his\nAlgebra der Logik (1891, p. 91) that the particular \n propositions about classes simply could not be expressed by equations in the \nalgebra of logic. \n\n\nWe look at a different objection, namely at the Boole/Jevons dispute\nover adding \\(x + x = x\\) as a law. \n\n[The following details are from The development of the theories\nof mathematical logic and the principles of mathematics, William\nStanley Jevons, by Philip Jourdain, 1914.]\n\n\nIn an 1863 letter to Boole regarding a draft of a commentary on\nBoole\u2019s system that Jevons was considering for his forthcoming book\n(Pure Logic, 1864), Jevons said:\n\nIt is surely obvious, however, that \\(x+x\\) is equivalent only to\n\\(x,\\ldots\\);\n\nProfessor Boole\u2019s notation [process of subtraction] is\ninconsistent with a self-evident law.\n\nIf my view be right, his system will come to be regarded as a\nmost remarkable combination of truth and error.\n\nBoole replied:\n\nThus the equation \\(x + x = 0\\) is equivalent to the equation \\(x =\n0\\); but the expression \\(x + x\\) is not equivalent to the expression\n\\(x\\).\n\nJevons responded by asking if Boole could deny the truth of \\(x + x = x\\).\n\nBoole, clearly exasperated, replies:\n\nTo be explicit, I now, however, reply that it is not true that in\nLogic \\(x + x = x\\), though it is true that \\(x + x = 0\\) is\nequivalent to \\(x = 0\\). If I do not write more it is not from any\nunwillingness to discuss the subject with you, but simply because if\nwe differ on this fundamental point it is impossible that we should\nagree in others.\n\nJevons\u2019s final effort to get Boole to understand the issue was:\n\nI do not doubt that it is open to you to hold \u2026[that \\(x + x =\nx\\) is not true] according to the laws of your system, and with this\nexplanation your system probably is perfectly consistent with itself\n\u2026 But the question then becomes a wider one\u2014does your\nsystem correspond to the Logic of common thought?\n\nJevons\u2019s new law, \\(x + x = x\\), resulted from\nhis conviction that + should denote what we now call\nunion, where the membership of \\(x + y\\) is given by an\ninclusive or. Boole simply did not see any way to define\n\\(x + y\\) as a class unless \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nwere disjoint, as already noted.\n\nVarious explanations have been given as to why Boole could not\ncomprehend the possibility of Jevons\u2019s suggestion. Boole clearly had\nthe semantic concept of union\u2014he expressed the union\nof \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) as \\(x + (1-x)y\\), a sum of two disjoint classes, and\npointed out that the elements of this class are the ones that belong\nto either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) or both. So how could he so\ncompletely fail to see the possibility of taking union for his\nfundamental operation + instead of his curious partial union\noperation?\n\nThe answer is simple: the law \\(x + x = x\\) would have destroyed his\nability to use ordinary algebra: from \\(x + x = x\\) one\nhas, by ordinary algebra, \\(x = 0\\). This would force every class\nsymbol to denote the empty class. Jevons\u2019s proposed law \\(x + x\n= x\\) was simply not true if one was committed to constructing the\nalgebra of logic on top of the laws and inference rules of ordinary\nalgebra. (Boolean rings satisfy all the laws of ordinary algebra, but not all\nof the inferences, for example, \\(2x = 0\\) implies \\(x = 0\\) does\nnot hold in Boolean rings.) It seems quite possible that Boole found\nthe simplest way to construct a model\u2014whose \ndomain was classes contained\nin the universe of discourse\u2014for an algebra of logic that\nallowed one to use all the equations and equational arguments\nthat were valid for numbers. \n",
