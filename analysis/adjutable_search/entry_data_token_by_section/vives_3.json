    "main_text": "Moral and social philosophy\n4. Moral and social philosophy\n\nVives\u2019 moral philosophy stems mainly from his Christian humanism\nand is aimed at the reform of both individuals and society. He often\nproclaims the superiority of Christian ethics over pagan wisdom (I,\n23; VI, 209\u201310). In De causis corruptarum artium, he\nargues at length that Aristotle\u2019s ethics, on account of its\nworldly conception of happiness and virtue, is completely incompatible\nwith the Christianity: \u201cwe cannot serve both Christ and\nAristotle, whose teaching are diametrically opposed to each\nother\u201d (VI, 218). He has more sympathy for Platonism and\nStoicism, which he believes are broadly in line with Christian\nmorality. In De initiis, sectis et laudibus philosophiae, he\neven asserts: \u201cI do not think, in fact, that there is any truer\nChristian than the Stoic sage\u201d (III, 17).\n\nIn Introductio ad sapientiam, inspired by the teaching of the\nStoics, he recommends self-knowledge as the first step toward virtue,\nwhich he regards as the culmination of human perfection. We should\nnot, in his judgment, call anything our own except our soul, in which\nlearning and virtue, or their opposites, are to be found. The body is\n\u201ca bondslave of the soul\u201d (mancipium animi),\nwhile such things as riches, power, nobility, honor, dignity, and\ntheir contraries, are completely external to man (I, 2; VI, 401). Vice\nfollows from a wrong judgment about the value of things:\n\u201cNothing \u2013 he writes \u2013 is more destructive in human\nlife than a corrupt judgment which gives no object its proper\nvalue\u201d (I, 1). To be wise, however, is not only to have true\nopinions about things, but also to translate this knowledge into\naction by desiring honorable things and avoiding evil (I, 2). Wisdom\ntherefore requires the subordination of the passions to the control of\nthe intellect.\n\nVives holds that the best means to secure the reform of society is\nthrough the moral and practical training of the individual. In his\nview, there are two related paths which are necessary to develop our\nhumanity: education and action. Education is fundamental in order for\nus to rise above our animal instincts and realize our full potential\nas human beings. However, learning needs to be applied in every day\nlife, especially for the public good (see Verbeke, 2014). Man, by his\nown nature, is a social being: \u201cExperience proves every day that\nman was created by God for society, both in this and in the eternal\nlife. For this reason God inspired in man an admirable disposition of\nbenevolence and good will toward other men\u201d (VI, 222\u20133).\nIn the first book of De subventione pauperum, which consists\nof a theoretical discussion of the human condition, he stresses not\nonly our need for and dependency on others, but also our natural\ninclination to love and help one another. He regards the development\nof society as a distinctly human achievement, based on the ability to\nprofit from experience and turn knowledge to useful ends. Social\nproblems, such as poverty and war, are the result of emotional\ndisorders. During Vives\u2019 lifetime, Europe experienced dissension\nand war between princes and within the church, as well as the\nincreased threat posed by Muslim expansion into Western Europe. He\naddressed the problem of political and religious disturbances in\nseveral works, which also deal with the psychological origins of\ndiscord, the proper conduct of all the offices of the commonweal, and\nthe theme of Christian harmony. His mayor political text on European\nwar and peace is De concordia et discordia in humano genere\nwhere he sets out the case for the origins of discord in society and\nhe aims to show how peace and concord can be fostered through\nknowledge of human nature, especially the emotions. According to him,\nthe virtue of the people can only be maintained and promoted in peace.\n\u201cIn war, as in a sick body, no member exercises its office\nproperly\u201d (V, 180\u20131). Vives deplored the Italian war\nbetween France and Spain (1521\u20136), which, he felt, completely\nignored the rights of the suffering population, and accused Francis I\nand Charles V of irresponsibility and criminal ambition (VI, 480). In\nthese circumstances, he often referred to the notion of natural law,\nwhich, as he explains in his preface to Cicero\u2019s De\nlegibus (On the Laws), has the same validity everywhere\nbecause it was impressed on the heart of every human being before\nbirth (V, 494).\n",
