    "main_text": "Specific Causal Theories of Mental Content || Evolutionary Functions\n3.2 Evolutionary Functions\n\nMany physical objects have functions. (Stampe (1977) was the first to\nnote this as a fact that might help causal theories of content.) A\nfamiliar mercury thermometer has the function of indicating\ntemperature. But, such a thermometer works against a set of background\nconditions which include the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric\npressure influences the volume of the vacuum that forms above the\ncolumn of mercury in the glass tube. So, the height of the column of\nmercury is the product of two causally relevant features, the ambient\natmospheric temperature and the ambient atmospheric pressure. This\nsuggests that one and the same physical device with the same causal\ndependencies can be used in different ways. A column of mercury in a\nglass tube can be used to measure temperature, but it is possible to\nput it to use as a pressure gauge. Which thing a column of mercury\nmeasures is determined by its function.\n\nThis observation suggests a way to specify which causes of\n\u201cX\u201d determine its content. The content of \u201cX\u201d,\nsay, the firing of some neurons, is determined by dogs, and not foxes,\nbecause it is the function of those neurons to register the presence\nof dogs, but not foxes. Further, the content of \u201cX\u201d does\nnot include LSD, microelectrodes, or quantum mechanical fluctuations,\nbecause it is not the function of \u201cX\u201d to fire in response\nto LSD, microelectrodes, or quantum mechanical fluctuations in the\nbrain. Similarly, the content of \u201cX\u201d does not include\nproximal sensory projections of dogs, because the function of the\nneurons is to register the presence of the dogs, not the sensory\nstimulations. It is the objective features of the world that matter to\nan organism, not its sensory states. Finally, it is the function of\n\u201cX\u201d to register the presence of dogs, but not the presence\nof questions, such as \u2018What kind of animal is named \n\u201cFido\u201d?\u2019,\nthat leads to \u201cX\u201d meaning dogs. Functions, thus, provide\na prima facie attractive means of properly winnowing down the\ncauses of \u201cX\u201d to those that are genuinely content\ndetermining.\n\nIn addition, the theory of evolution by natural selection apparently\nprovides a non-semantic, non-intentional basis upon which to explicate\nfunctions and, in turn, semantic content. Individual organisms vary in\ntheir characteristics, such as how their neurons respond to features\nof the environment. Some of these differences in how neurons respond\nmake a difference to an organism\u2019s survival and reproduction.\nFinally, some of these very differences may be heritable. Natural\nselection, commonly understood as this differential reproduction of\nheritable variation, is purely causal. Suppose that there is a\npopulation of rabbits. Further suppose that either by a genetic\nmutation or by the recombination of existing genes, some of these\nrabbits develop neurons that are wired into their visual systems in\nsuch a way that they fire (more or less reliably) in the presence of\ndogs. Further, the firing of these neurons is wired into a freezing\nbehavior in these rabbits. Because of this configuration, the rabbits\nwith the \u201cdog neurons\u201d are less likely to be detected by\ndogs, hence more likely to survive and reproduce. Finally, because the\ngenes for these neurons are heritable, the offspring of these\ndog-sensitive rabbits will themselves be dog-sensitive. Over time, the\nnumber of the dog-sensitive rabbits will increase, thereby displacing\nthe dog-insensitive rabbits. So, natural selection will, in such a\nscenario, give rise to mental representations of dogs. Insofar as such\na story is plausible, there is hope that natural selection and the\ngenesis of functions can provide a naturalistically acceptable means\nof delimiting content-determining causes.\n3.2.1 Objections to Evolutionary Functions\n\nThere is no doubt that individual variation, differential\nreproduction, and inheritance can be understood in a purely causal\nmanner. Yet, there remains skepticism about how naturalistically one\ncan describe what natural selection can select for. There are doubts\nabout the extent to which the objects of selection really can be\nspecified without illicit importation of intentional notions. Fodor\n(1989, 1990a) give voice to some of this skepticism. Prima\nfacie, it makes sense to say that the neurons in our hypothetical\nrabbits fire in response to the presence of dogs, hence that there is\nselection for dog representations. But, it makes just as much sense,\none might worry, to say that it is sensitivity to dog-look-alikes that\nleads to the greater fitness of the rabbits with the new\n neurons.[8]\n There are genes for the dog-look-alike neurons and these genes are\nheritable. Moreover, those rabbits that freeze in response to\ndog-look-alikes are more likely to survive and reproduce than are\nthose that do not so freeze, hence one might say that the freezing is\nin response to dog-look-alikes. So, our ability to say that the\nmeaning of the rabbits\u2019 mental representation \u201cX\u201d is\ndog, rather than dog-look-alike, depends on our ability to say that it\nis the dog-sensitivity of \u201cX\u201d, rather than the\ndog-look-alike-sensitivity of \u201cX\u201d, that keeps the rabbits\nalive longer. Of course, being dog-sensitive and being\ndog-look-alike-sensitive are connected, but the problem here is that\nboth being dog-look-alike-sensitive and being dog-sensitive can\nincrease fitness in ways that lead to the fixation of a genotype. And\nit can well be that it is avoidance of dogs that keeps a rabbit alive,\nbut one still needs some principled basis for saying that the rabbits\navoid dogs by being sensitive to dogs, rather than by being sensitive\nto dog-look-alikes. The latter appears to be good enough for the\ndifferential reproduction of heritable variation to do its work. Where\nwe risk importing semantic notions into the mix is in understanding\nselection intentionally, rather than purely causally. We need a notion\nof \u201cselection for\u201d that is both general enough to work for\nall the mental contents causal theorists aspire to address and that\ndoes not tacitly import semantic notions.\n\nIn response to this sort of objection, it has been proposed that the\ncorrect explanation of a rabbit\u2019s evolutionary success with,\nsay, \u201cX\u201d, is not that this enables the rabbit to avoid\ndog-look-alikes, but that it enables them to avoid dogs. It is dogs,\nbut not mere dog-look-alikes, that prey on rabbits. (This sort of\nresponse is developed in Millikan (1991) and Neander (1995).) Yet, the\nrejoinder is that if we really want to get at the correct explanation\nof a rabbit-cum-\u201cX\u201d system, then we should not suppose\nthat \u201cX\u201d means dog. Instead, we should say that it is in\nvirtue of the fact that \u201cX\u201d picks up on something like,\nsay, predator of such and such characteristics that the\n\u201cX\u201d alarm system increases the chance of a rabbit\u2019s\nsurvival. (This sort of rejoinder may be found in Agar (1993).)\n\nThis problem aside, there is also some concern about the extent to\nwhich it is plausible to suppose that natural selection could act on\nthe fine details of the operation of the brain, such as the firing of\nneurons in the presence of dogs. (This is an objection raised in Fodor\n(1990c)). Natural selection might operate to increase the size of the\nbrain so there is more cortical mass for cognitive processing. Natural\nselection might also operate to increase the folding of the brain so\nas to maximize the cortical surface area that can be contained within\nthe brain. Natural selection might also lead to compartmentalization\nof the brain, so that one particular region could be dedicated to\nvisual processing, another to auditory processing, and still another\nto face processing. Yet, many would take it to be implausible to\nsuppose that natural selection works at the level of individual mental\nrepresentations. The brain is too plastic and there is too much\nindividual variation in the brains of mammals to admit of selection\nacting in this way. Moreover, such far reaching effects of natural\nselection would lead to innate ideas not merely of colors and shapes,\nbut of dogs, cats, cars, skyscrapers, and movie stars. Rather than\nsupposing that functions are determined by natural selection across\nmultiple generations, many philosophers contend that it is more\nplausible that the functions that underlie mental representations are\nacquired through cognitive development.\n",
