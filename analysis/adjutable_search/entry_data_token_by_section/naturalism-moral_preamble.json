    "main_text": "\n\n\u2018Moral naturalism\u2019 is a term with a variety of meanings in\nethics, but it usually refers to the version of moral realism\naccording to which moral facts are natural facts. That is the subject\nof this entry.\n\nNaturalistic approaches to ethics are as old as moral theory itself.\nBoth Aristotelian and Confucian ethics, for instance, contain\nrecognizably naturalistic elements. But moral naturalism wasn\u2019t\narticulated as a distinctive metaethical doctrine until 1903, with\nG.E. Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica. Principia\nestablished metaethics as a branch of moral theory distinct from\nfirst-order ethics, and did so by arguing against moral naturalism as\na metaethical doctrine. This rejection of naturalism shaped moral\ntheory for nearly a century. Beginning in the 1980s, however,\nmetaethicists began developing new ways of articulating and defending\nmoral naturalism. It is now one of the most popular views in\nmetaethics, perhaps the most popular.\n\nThis discussion will be organized in three parts. The first part, in\nSections 1\u20132, will characterize moral naturalism together with\ntwo other views that are closely associated with moral naturalism,\ndescriptivism and reductivism. The second part, in Sections 3\u20134,\nwill look at arguments for and against moral naturalism. And the third\npart, in Sections 5\u20137, will examine the three most popular\ncomprehensive naturalist doctrines in detail.\n",
