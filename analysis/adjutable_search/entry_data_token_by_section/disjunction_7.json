Alternative-based accounts of disjunction\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that recent semantic work has argued\nthat disjunctions like \u201c\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\u201d should be\ntreated as generating a set of propositions \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) rather than\nyielding the classical join of the two disjuncts. The intuition behind\nthese accounts is that the main function of a disjunctive sentence is\nto present a set of alternatives. A disjunction offers\ncharacterizations of (at least) two different possible states of\naffairs, and (under certain circumstances) asserts that at least one\nof these holds in the actual world. Besides phenomena of free choice\ndiscussed in the previous section, other linguistic facts have been\nargued to justify an alternative-based analysis of disjunction. In\nthis final section, we first introduce the recent inquisitive\nsemantics as an example of an \u201calternative-based\u201d system\nwith a fully developed logic, and then briefly discuss these further\nlinguistic motivations.\n\n\n\n\n(a) classical\n\n\n\n\n(b) inquisitive\n\n\nFigure 1. \\((p \\vee q)\\) in classical\nlogic and in inquisitive logic.\n\n",
