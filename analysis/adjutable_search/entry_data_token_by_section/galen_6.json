    "main_text": "Epistemology: Demonstration, Scientific Method, Human Knowledge || Limits and Purposes of Knowledge\n3.4 Limits and Purposes of Knowledge\nGalen claims that in his youth\u2014partly in response to the confusion caused by mutually contradictory philosophical sects, all claiming certainty on unprovable issues\u2014he nearly succumbed to the lures of Skepticism (Lib. Prop. 14/11, 18). The above possibility of certainty, as provided by mathematics and geometry, is what saved him. But an understanding of the limits of human knowledge is as important as the project of acquiring it in those areas where that is possible. Galen is scathing about those who commit themselves rashly on insufficient evidence, and about philosophers who debate propositions on which demonstrative knowledge is impossible (such as the existence and nature of the void outside the cosmos) (Aff. Pecc. Dig. II.6\u20137, 308\u201313). Here, one criterion to which he appeals in refusing to make pronouncements on certain questions is their lack of relevance to \u201cmedicine or ethical/practical philosophy\u201d (e.g., Prop. Plac. 15, 120; PHP IX.9, 600).\nYet the value of knowledge is not justified purely in pragmatic terms. In Prop. Plac., Galen puts forward a more subtle, tripartite division of areas of knowledge: (1) matters on which he claims that it is possible to have, and that he has, certain knowledge; (2) matters on which he claims no knowledge; and (3) matters on which he claims only to be able to advance to the \u201cplausible\u201d, but where the attempt to gain knowledge is still worthwhile, even though they are not of direct practical value (Prop. Plac. 14, 114\u201317). This last category is in a sense the most interesting and Galenically distinctive. Such knowledge, he suggests, \u201cwould adorn the art, if knowledge could be obtained\u201d; he seems here to associate this category with element theory. If so, this acknowledgement of a limitation on certainty will affect our view of Galen\u2019s \u201cdemonstrations\u201d in this area (\u00a73.1 above). Perhaps, although it is not apparent from his dedicated\u2014and highly polemical\u2014discussions in Hipp. Elem. and in HNH, this is after all an area where he admits to something less than scientific certainty, at least in detail.\nOne area in which Galen openly asserts his ignorance is that of the \u201csubstance/essence (ousia) of the soul\u201d: is it a non-bodily substance, as Plato thought, or composed of physical elements? (See further \u00a76.4 on ousia and 7 on soul-theory.) In spite of some strong apparently physicalist statements in this area, Galen consistently throughout the corpus denies that he knows the answer to this question (Donini 2008; Singer 2013: 32\u201333 and Ch. 4). The case is similar in response to the question, how information is transmitted into the embryo in the process of conception and foetal development. That one needs to invoke some form of \u201cintelligent design\u201d is, to Galen, absolutely clear. But precisely who or what is responsible? How does the infant acquire, from birth or even before, the ability to perform all its innate functions? In an interestingly open-ended discussion in The Shaping of the Embryo (Foet. Form. 6, 196\u2013201), Galen ends with a genuine aporia: all existing options within the tradition\u2014the Platonic \u201cworld soul\u201d extending throughout matter, the presence of a rational soul in a pre-rational animal, a plurality of souls for each individual muscle function\u2014have consequences which make them unattractive; but he does not himself claim to have the answer.\nWe are left with a challenging and distinctive epistemological position, explicitly asserting the limitations to human knowledge in certain metaphysical or higher-level physical areas of enquiry, but anti-Skeptic and committed to the fundamental knowability of the physical world, as well as to the value of the quest for knowledge in areas where reasoning on the basis of clear empirical observation and/or truths evident to reason makes that possible.\n",
