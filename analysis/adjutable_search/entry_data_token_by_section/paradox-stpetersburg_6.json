    "main_text": "Relative Expected Utility Theory\n7. The Pasadena Game\n\nThe Pasadena paradox introduced by Nover and H\u00e1jek (2004) is\ninspired by the St. Petersburg game, but the pay-off schedule is\ndifferent. As usual, a fair coin is flipped n times until it\ncomes up heads for the first time. If n is odd the player wins\n\\((2^n)/n\\) units of utility; however, if n is even the player\nhas to pay \\((2^n)/n\\) units. How much should one be willing\nto pay for playing this game?\n\nIf we sum up the terms in the temporal order in which the outcomes\noccur and calculate expected utility in the usual manner we find that\nthe Pasadena game is worth:\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{1} - \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{2} + \\frac{1}{8}\\cdot\\frac{8}{3}\n &- \\frac{1}{16}\\cdot\\frac{16}{4} + \\frac{1}{32}\\cdot\\frac{16}{5} - \\cdots  \\\\\n &= 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\cdots \\\\\n &= \\sum_n \\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}\n\\end{align}\\]\n \n\nThis infinite sum converges to ln 2 (about 0.69 units of\nutility). However, Nover and H\u00e1jek point out that we would\nobtain a very different result if we were to rearrange the order in\nwhich the very same numbers are summed up. Here is one of many\npossible examples of this mathematical fact: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{8}\n  + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{10} &- \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{1}{7} - \\frac{1}{14}\n  - \\frac{1}{16} \\cdots \\\\\n &= \\frac{1}{2}(\\ln 2).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThis is, of course, not news to mathematicians. The infinite sum\nproduced by the Pasadena game is known as the alternating harmonic\nseries, which is a conditionally convergent series. (A\nseries \\(a_n\\) is conditionally convergent if \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\na_n\\) converges but \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\lvert a_n\\rvert\\)\ndiverges.) Because of a theorem known as the Riemann rearrangement\ntheorem, we know that if an infinite series is conditionally\nconvergent, then its terms can always be rearranged such the sum\nconverges to any finite number, or to \\(+\\infty\\) or to\n\\(-\\infty\\).\n\nNover and H\u00e1jek\u2019s point is that it seems\narbitrary to sum up the terms in the Pasadena game in the\ntemporal order produced by the coin flips. To see why, it is helpful\nto imagine a slightly modified version of the game. In their original\npaper, Nover and H\u00e1jek ask us to imagine that:\n\n\nWe toss a fair coin until it lands heads for the first time. We have\nwritten on consecutive cards your pay-off for each possible outcome.\nThe cards read as follows: (Top card) If the first =heads is on toss\n#1, we pay you $2. [\u2026] By accident, we drop the cards, and\nafter picking them up and stacking them on the table, we find that\nthey have been rearranged. No matter, you say\u2014obviously the game\nhas not changed, since the pay-off schedule remains the same. The\ngame, after all, is correctly and completely specified by the\nconditionals written on the cards, and we have merely changed the\norder in which the conditions are presented. (Nover and H\u00e1jek\n2004: 237\u2013239)\n\n\nUnder the circumstances described here, we seem to have no\nreason to prefer any particular order in which to sum up the terms of\nthe infinite series. So is the expected value of Pasadena game \\(\\ln\n2\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{2}(\\ln 2)\\) or \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) or \\(-\\infty\\) or\n345.68? All these suggestions seem equally arbitrary. Moreover, the\nsame holds true for the Altadena game, in which every payoff is\nincreased by one dollar. The Altadena game is clearly better than then\nPasadena game, but advocates of expected utility theory seem unable to\nexplain why.\n\nThe literature on the Pasadena game is extensive. See, e.g.,\nH\u00e1jek and Nover (2006), Fine (2008), Smith (2014), and Bartha\n(2016). A particularly influential solution is due to Easwaran (2008).\nHe introduces a distinction between a strong and a weak version of the\nexpected utility principle, inspired by the well-known distinction\nbetween the strong and weak versions of the law of large numbers.\nAccording to the strong law of large numbers, the average utility of a\ngame converges to its expected utility with probability one as the\nnumber of iterations goes to infinity. The weak law of large numbers\nholds that for a sufficiently large set of trials the probability can\nbe made arbitrarily small that that the average utility will not\ndiffer from the expected utility by more than some small pre-specified\namount. So according to the weak expected utility principle, \n\n\nby fixing in advance a high enough number of n plays, the\naverage payoff per play can be almost guaranteed to be arbitrarily\nclose to ln 2, \n\n\nwhile the strong version of the principle entails that \n\n\nif one player keeps getting to decide whether to play again or quit,\nthen she can almost certainly guarantee as much profit as she wants,\nregardless of the (constant) price per play. (Easwaran 2008: 635) \n\n\nEaswaran\u2019s view is that the weak expected utility principle\nshould guide the agent\u2019s choice and that the fair price to pay\nis ln 2.\n\nHowever, Easwaran\u2019s solution cannot be generalized to other\ngames with slightly different payoff schemes. Bartha (2016: 805)\ndescribes a version of the Pasadena game that has no expected value.\nIn this game, the Arroyo game, the player wins \\(-1^{n+1}(n+1)\\) with\nprobability \\(p_n = \\frac{1}/{(n+1)}\\). If we calculate the expected\nutility in the order in which the outcomes are produced, we get the\nsame result as for the Pasadena game: \\(1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3}\n- \\frac{1}{4} \\cdots\\) For reasons explained (and proved) by Bartha,\nthe Arroyo game has no weak expected utility.\n\nIt is also worth keeping in mind that Pasadena-like scenarios can\narise in non-probabilistic contexts (see Peterson 2013). Imagine, for\ninstance, an infinite population in which the utility of individual\nnumber j is \\(\\frac{(-1)^{j-1}}{j}\\). What is the total utility\nof this population? Or imagine that you are the proud owner of a\nJackson Pollock painting. An art dealer tells you the overall\naesthetic value of the painting is the sum of some of its\nparts. You number the points in the painting with arbitrary\nnumbers 1, 2, 3, \u2026 (perhaps by writing down the numbers on\ncards and then dropping all cards on the floor); the aesthetic value\nof each point j is \\(\\frac{(-1)^{j-1}}{j}\\). What is the total\naesthetic value of the painting? These examples are non-probabilistic\nversions of the Pasadena problem, to which the expected utility\nprinciple is inapplicable. There is no uncertainty about any state of\nnature; the decision maker knows for sure what the world is like. This\nmeans that Easwaran\u2019s distinction between weak and strong\nexpectations is not applicable.\n\nAlthough some of these problems may appear to be somewhat esoteric, we\ncannot dismiss them. All Pasadena-like problems are vulnerable to the\nsame contagion problem as the St Petersburg game (see\n section 2).\n H\u00e1jek and Smithson offer the following colorful\nillustration:\n\n\nYou can choose between pizza and Chinese for dinner. Each\noption\u2019s desirability depends on how you weigh probabilistically\nvarious scenarios (burnt pizza, perfectly cooked pizza,\u2026\nover-spiced Chinese, perfectly spiced Chinese\u2026) and the\nutilities you accord them. Let us stipulate that neither choice\ndominates the other, yet it should be utterly straightforward for you\nto make a choice. But it is not if the expectations of pizza and\nChinese are contaminated by even a miniscule [sic] assignment of\ncredence to the Pasadena game. If the door is opened to it just a\ncrack, it kicks the door down and swamps all expected utility\ncalculations. You cannot even choose between pizza and Chinese.\n(H\u00e1jek and Smithson 2012: 42, emph. added.)\n\n\nColyvan (2006) suggests that we should bite the bullet on the Pasadena\ngame and accept that it has no expected utility. The\ncontagion problem shows that if we were to do so, we would have to\nadmit that the principle of maximizing expected utility would be\napplicable to nearly no decisions. Moreover, because the\ncontagion problem is equally applicable to all games discussed in this\nentry (St. Petersburg, Pasadena, Arroyo, etc.) it seems that all these\nproblems may require a unified solution.\n\nFor hundreds of years, decision theorists have agreed that rational\nagents should maximize expected utility. The discussion has mostly\nbeen focused on how to interpret this principle, especially for\nchoices in which the causal structure of the world is unusual.\nHowever, until recently no one has seriously questioned that the\nprinciple of maximizing expected utility is the right principle to\napply. The rich and growing literature on the many puzzles inspired by\nthe St. Petersburg paradox indicate that this might have been a\nmistake. Perhaps the principle of maximizing expected utility should\nbe replaced by some entirely different principle?\n",
