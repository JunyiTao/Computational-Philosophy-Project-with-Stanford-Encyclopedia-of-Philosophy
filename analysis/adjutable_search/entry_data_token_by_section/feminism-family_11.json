    "main_text": "Reproductive Choice || Commercial Surrogacy\n4. Concluding thoughts\n\n\nFeminist writing on the family and reproduction is rich and\nmultifaceted. By forcing mainstream political philosophy to take into\naccount the importance of the family for social justice, feminists have\nchanged the field. At the same time, our efforts remain very much a\nwork in progress, much as are our current social practices of making\nfamilies and babies. In conclusion, I will mention two areas that need\nmore attention:\n\n\n(1) The claim that the family is not private is not the same as the\nclaim that there is no value to having a concept of privacy, nor does\nit entail that there is no way to draw a useful distinction between the\nprivate and public realms. How much public structuring of private\nchoices is permissible to foster gender justice? How do we balance\nclaims of gender injustice with other moral considerations like freedom\nof religion and freedom of association?\n\n\n(2) With notable exceptions, too few feminist philosophers have\noffered specific policy proposals for changes in domestic arrangements,\nor for policies designed to counteract those arrangements. We need more\nattention to creative family related policies that might lessen the\nhold of centuries of gender hierarchy. We also need good cross-country\ncomparisons, which draw on some of the alternative policies that have\nbeen tried in other countries, including policies designed to re-shape\nlabor markets, reform divorce law and provide safety nets for poor\nfamilies and their children.\n",
