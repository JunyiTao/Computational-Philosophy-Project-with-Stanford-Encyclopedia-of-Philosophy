    "main_text": "Ross\u2019s Moral Metaphysics\n7. Ross\u2019s Contemporary Importance\n\nRoss\u2019s contemporary importance to moral philosophy rests on his\nclarification and defence of a form of pluralistic deontology\nattempting to avoid the alleged deficiencies of utilitarianism without\nembracing the alleged excesses of Kantianism. The most distinctive\nfeature of this view is the notion of a prima facie duty or\nof a consideration counting in favour of or against an act, morally\nspeaking. Ross\u2019s view serves as an important source of\ninspiration for those dissatisfied with Kantianism and utilitarianism.\nRoss said little about issues in what we now call practical or applied\nethics. He belonged to a group of moral philosophers, including Moore,\nPrichard and others, for whom it was not important to work out views\non contemporary issues or to use moral philosophy to change the world\n(though see Ross 1929; RG 56\u201364, for his reflections on punishment;\nfor illuminating discussion of Ross\u2019s view, see Moriarty 2006;\nZimmerman 2011). Nevertheless, Ross\u2019s view has seen a resurgence\nin ethics and applied ethics (Audi 2004; Beauchamp and Childress 2008;\nPhillips 2019; Stratton-Lake 2011b).\n\nRoss also outlines a moral epistemology distinct from the coherentist\nreflective equilibrium that has held sway over moral philosophy for\nthe last fifty years. He relies on the idea that at the core of ethics\nthere are certain self-evident truths which can be discovered by\nreflection on what we think about moral and axiological questions.\nThose dissatisfied with the standard model for doing moral philosophy\nbut who at the same time find themselves attracted to the idea ethical\ntheories should capture the main elements of common-sense morality do\nwell to consult Ross\u2019s unique contribution to moral\nepistemology.\n",
