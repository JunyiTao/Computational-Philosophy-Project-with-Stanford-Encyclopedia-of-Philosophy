    "main_text": "\n\nJapanese philosophers have historically interacted intensively with a\nmultitude of philosophies outside their native boundaries\u2014most\nprominently Chinese, Indian, Korean, and Western. So they have\nbenefited from a rich trove of ideas and theories on which to draw in\ndeveloping their own distinctive philosophical perspectives. As a\nresult Japanese philosophers have always been acutely attuned to the\nintimate relations among culture, ways of thinking, and philosophical\nworld views. An island chain twice as distant from its continental\nneighbors as Britain is to its own, Japan escaped successful foreign\ninvasion until 1945. Accordingly, it largely negotiated its own\ncultural, including philosophical, development without an alien power\nforcibly imposing on the archipelago its own religious world view or\nphilosophical theories. The early twentieth-century academic\nphilosophers in Japan, for example, were so well educated in the\nworld\u2019s texts and theories, many in the original languages, that\nthey were among the most internationally informed philosophers of\ntheir time.\n\nWithout foreign ideas being coerced on them, Japanese thinkers had the\nluxury of alternatives outside the binary of simple wholehearted\nacceptance or utter rejection. New theories from abroad could be tried\nand, if need be, experimentally modified before making a final\ndecision about endorsement. Sometimes a foreign philosophy might be\nseen as supplying raw material to be fashioned to serve ongoing native\nphilosophical enterprises. In other cases a new philosophy might be\nimported whole cloth to either supplement or supplant a home system of\nthought. Because of those circumstances, Japanese philosophers\nacquired skill in analyzing foreign ideas by examining the cultural\nassumptions behind them to determine their potential implications if\nthey were to be adopted into their own culture.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, this article explains Japanese philosophy in\nfive sections. Section 1 considers how Japanese have traditionally\nunderstood philosophy to be a Way (michi) of engaging reality\nrather than a detached method for studying it. The next section lists\nsome patterns of analysis that are hallmarks of that Way of Japanese\nphilosophizing. Section 3 identifies five distinguishable traditions\nhaving had a major impact on Japanese philosophy, explaining a few\ncentral ideas from each. Section 4 surveys how those five traditions\nhave evolved and interacted over four major periods of Japanese\nhistory from ancient times to the present. Section 5 concludes with a\nfew themes given special emphasis in Japanese philosophy that might be\nprovocative to philosophy at large.\n",
