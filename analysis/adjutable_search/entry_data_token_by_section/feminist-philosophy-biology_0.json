    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nFeminist philosophy of biology bears much in common with\nnon-feminist philosophy of biology. Non-feminist philosophy of\nbiology is highly interdisciplinary and has unclear disciplinary\nboundaries. Major contributors include scientists as well as\nphilosophers. There are two general and often closely related\napproaches to the practice of philosophy of biology. First, philosophy\nof biology uses philosophical methods to address topics of central\nimportance in the biological sciences, such as natural selection,\nfitness, adaptation, and the nature of genes. Second, philosophy\nof biology addresses central topics in the philosophy of science, such\nas reductionism, laws of nature, and theory change, from the\nperspective of the biological sciences instead of physics as is more\ntraditional in philosophy of science. Philosophy of biology is\noften informed by a naturalistic approach, meaning that the work is\nclosely tied to the actual history and practice of the science in\nquestion. It is not uncommon for philosophers of biology, at\nleast at some point during their careers, to become significantly\ninvolved with the science itself, either in terms of conducting\nbiological research or collaborating with biologists on research or\npedagogical projects.\n\n\nThe boundaries of feminist philosophy of biology are similarly\nunclear. It is not clear whether the authors cited in this entry would\nprimarily label themselves as philosophers of biology or science\nstudies scholars or scientists. Not surprisingly, the two general\napproaches to philosophy of biology are also advanced in feminist\nphilosophy of biology. First, many feminist philosophers of\nbiology are concerned with biological concepts and knowledge claims\nregarding sex and gender \n(see the entry on feminist perspectives on sex and gender), \nas well as the influence of gender values on\nbiological research. Sex refers to biological differences between males\nand females. Gender refers to the meanings that humans make of these\nbiological differences, and the individual and social aspects of\nmasculinity and femininity. Since it is with our bodies that we\nact, and since psychological and social causes can affect our bodies,\nthere is much debate about the relationships between sex and gender. By\n\u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019 I am referring to the sex\nof human and non-human organisms and by \u2018men\u2019 and\n\u2018women\u2019 I am referring to the gender of humans. Feminist\nanalysis is often performed as a control (in a sense to be explained\nbelow) to test for the unrecognized influence of gender values on the\nproduction of knowledge, in existing knowledge claims, and in the\nchoices of research projects. These gender values can include\nsexism (devaluation, in practice primarily of women, based on\ntraditional stereotypes of gender roles) and androcentrism (a focus on\nmen or males and the neglect or exclusion of women or females).\nAs I will explain in more detail below, feminist investigations\nof the relationships between gender values, and the practices and\nproducts of the biological sciences, can take place in a range of\nepistemological projects. Some projects focus on removing gender\nbias, and others focus on developing an understanding of the role of\nsocial values, including gender values, in biological research.\n\n\nSecond, feminist philosophy of biology considers the gendered nature\nof foundational concepts in biology, philosophy of biology and\nphilosophy of science, such as reductionism (see section 4.2),\ndeterminism (see section 4.1) and the nature of objectivity (see the\nentry on feminist epistemology and philosophy of science).\nAs I will discuss below, some feminist philosophers of biology contend\nthat gendered social values are not only intertwined with particular\ntheories or knowledge claims, but can also support and be supported by\nthese foundational concepts (Fehr 2004, Longino 1990). Since\nthese concepts are of central concern in non-feminist philosophy of\nbiology and philosophy of science more generally, there is ample\nopportunity for feminist and non-feminist philosophy of biology to\nbecome more closely related. There is also significant\nfeminist work regarding scientific objectivity that is at least\npartially motivated by the presence and power of unacknowledged\ngendered assumptions, including androcentrism and sexism, in biological\nsciences ranging from genetics and cell biology, to sociobiology (for\nexample Keller 1985, Longino 1990, 2002, Haraway 1989, Harding\n1986).\n",
