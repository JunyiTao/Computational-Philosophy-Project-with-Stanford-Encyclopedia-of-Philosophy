    "main_text": "Brief Biography\n1. Brief Biography\n\nGalileo was born in Pisa on February 15, 1564. By the time he died on\nJanuary 8, 1642 (but for problems with the date, see Machamer 1998b,\n24\u201325), he was as famous as any person in Europe. Moreover, when\nhe was born there was no such thing as \u2018science\u2019; yet by\nthe time he died, science was well on its way to becoming a\ndiscipline, and its concepts and method a complete philosophical\nsystem.\n\nGalileo\u2019s father Vincenzo, though of noble heritage, was a\nsemi-itinerant court musician and composer of modest means, who also\nauthored treatises on music theory; his mother, Giulia Ammannati,\ndescended from Pisan cloth merchants. In 1572, they resettled the\nfamily in Florence. As a boy, Galileo was tutored privately and, for a\ntime, by the monks at Vallombrosa, where he considered a religious\nvocation and may have started a novitiate. He returned home, however,\nand then enrolled for a medical degree at the University of Pisa in\n1580. He never completed this degree, but instead studied mathematics,\nnotably with Ostilio Ricci, a mathematics teacher attached to the\nTuscan court and the Florentine Accademia del Disegno.\n\nAfter leaving university, Galileo worked as a private mathematics\ntutor around Florence and Siena and cultivated the support of leading\nmathematicians. He visited Christoph Clavius, professor at the Jesuit\nCollegio Romano, and corresponded with the engineer Guildobaldo del\nMonte, Marchese of Urbino. In 1588, he applied and was turned down for\na professorship in Bologna, but a year later, with the help of Clavius\nand del Monte, he was appointed lecturer in mathematics at Pisa. In\n1592, he obtained, at a much higher salary, a chair of mathematics at\nthe University of Padua, in the Venetian Republic. Galileo also\nsupplemented his income by producing a calculating instrument of his\nown design (see Galilei 1606) and other devices in a household\nworkshop, and by private tutoring and consulting on practical\nmathematics and engineering. During this period, he began a\nrelationship with Marina Gamba, and their daughter Virginia was born\nin 1600. In 1601, they had another daughter, Livia, and a son,\nVincenzo, in 1606.\n\nIn Padua, Galileo worked out much of the mechanics he would publish\nlater in life, and which constitute his primary lasting\ncontribution to physical science. However, these projects were\ninterrupted in 1609, when Galileo heard about the recently invented\nspyglass, invented an improved telescope, and used it to make\nastounding celestial discoveries. He rushed these into print in\nSidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which appeared\nin March 1610 and launched Galileo onto the world stage. Among others,\nJohannes Kepler, Imperial Mathematician at Prague, lauded the work\n(Kepler 1610). Clavius and his colleagues at the Collegio Romano\nconfirmed its results and threw a celebratory banquet when Galileo\nvisited in 1611. During the same Roman sojourn, Galileo was admitted\nto what was perhaps the first scientific society, the Accademia dei\nLincei; he would style himself \u201cLincean Academician\u201d for\nthe rest of his life. Some fascinating treatments of this period\nof Galileo\u2019s life and motivations have recently appeared\n(Biagioli 2006; Reeves 2008; Wilding 2014).\n\nGalileo also used the Starry Messenger to solicit patronage\nin his native Tuscany, naming the moons of Jupiter he had found the\n\u201cMedicean\u201d stars, in honor of the ruling Medici family.\nHis negotiations were ultimately successful, and Galileo moved to\nFlorence as \u201cChief Mathematician and Philosopher to the Grand\nDuke\u201d and holder of a sinecure professorship at Pisa. His\ndaughters moved with him and were shortly placed in the convent of\nSaint Matthew at Arcetri, near Florence. Vincenzo and his mother,\nMarina, were left behind in Venice.\n\nOnce a courtier, Galileo entered into several debates on scientific\ntopics. In 1612, he published a Discourse on Floating Bodies,\nand in 1613, Letters on Sunspots, where he first openly\nexpressed support for Copernican heliocentrism. In 1613\u201314,\nGalileo entered into discussions of Copernicanism through his student\nBenedetto Castelli, and wrote a Letter to Castelli\ndefending the doctrine from theological objections. Meanwhile, it\nhad become known that Copernicanism was under scrutiny by Church\nauthorities. Galileo lectured and lobbied against its condemnation,\nexpanding his Letter to Castelli into the widely\ncirculated Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina in 1615\nand travelling to Rome late that year. Nevertheless, in March 1616,\nCopernicus\u2019s On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Orbs\nwas suspended (i.e., temporarily censored), pending correction,\nby the Congregation of the Index of Prohibited Books. Galileo himself\nwas called to an audience with Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, a leading\ntheologian and member of the Roman Inquisition, who admonished him not\nto teach or defend Copernican theory. (The details of this episode are\nfar from straightforward, and remain disputed even today. See Shea and\nArtigas 2003; Fantoli 2005.)\n\nIn 1623, Galileo published The Assayer, which deals with\nthe nature of comets and argues they are sublunary phenomena. This\nbook includes some of Galileo\u2019s most famous methodological\npronouncements, including the claim that the book of nature is written\nin the language of mathematics. It also contains passages suggestive\nof atomism, a heretical doctrine, for which the book was referred to\nthe Inquisition, which dismissed the charge.\n\nAlso in 1623, Maffeo Barberini, Galileo\u2019s supporter and friend,\nwas elected Pope Urban VIII. Galileo felt empowered to begin work on\nhis Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. The\n\u201ctwo systems\u201d are the Ptolemaic and Copernican, and the\ntext clearly, though not explicitly, favors the latter. Printing was\ncompleted in Florence by February 1632. Shortly afterwards, the\nInquisition banned its sale, and Galileo was ordered to Rome for\ntrial. In June 1633, Galileo was convicted of \u201cvehement\nsuspicion of heresy,\u201d and a sentence of imprisonment was\nimmediately commuted to perpetual house arrest. (There is more about\nthese events and their implications in the final section of this\n article, Galileo and the Church.)\n\nIn 1634, while Galileo was confined to his villa in Arcetri, his\nbeloved eldest daughter died (Sobel 1999). Around this time, he began\nwork on his final book, Discourses and Mathematical\nDemonstrations Concerning Two New Sciences, based on the\nmechanics he had developed early in his career. The manuscript was\nsmuggled out of Italy and published in Holland by the Elzeviers in\n1638. Galileo died early in 1642, and due to his condemnation, his\nburial place was obscure until he was re-interred in 1737.\n\nFor detailed biographical material, the best and classic work dealing\nwith Galileo\u2019s scientific achievements is Stillman\nDrake\u2019s Galileo at Work (1978). More\nrecently, J. L. Heilbron has written a magnificent\nbiography, Galileo (2010), that touches on all the\nmultiple facets of his life. \n",
