    "main_text": "Predecessors\n2. Predecessors\n\nIn his epistemological works, Fleck combined: (1) experience of a\nscientist; (2) reflections on the history of medicine; (3)\nphilosophical ideas; and (4) sociological ideas. In the light of his\nown sociology and philosophy of science, one needs first to ask which\nthought collectives he belonged to and what thought styles he\nassimilated.\n\n(1) While working in a private laboratory and hospital Fleck conducted\ncertain medical research, but he remained outside university circles,\nand his research was rather marginal.\n\n(2) In the interwar period Poland was probably the only country where\nfaculties of medicine had chairs for the philosophy and history of\nmedicine (L\u00f6wy 1990). Between 1908 and 1919 W\u0142adys\u0142aw\nSzumowski taught the history of medicine in Lvov. Fleck also had some\nprofessional contact with two philosophers and historians of medicine,\nW\u0142odzimierz Sieradzki and Witold Ziembicki. He was a friend of\nJak\u00f3b Frostig, a philosophizing psychiatrist. It is worth\nmentioning a few remarks from Frostig\u2019s Das schizophrene\nDenken. Ph\u00e4nomenologische Studien zum Problem der widersinnigen\nS\u00e4tze (Leipzig 1929), which can be seen almost without any\nchange among those written by Fleck: \u201cWe mean by [the expression\n\u2018social group\u2019] any group of people bound together by a\ncommon \u2018intention\u2019. Thus the group of mathematicians is a\ngroup of a very special, mathematical mentality. (\u2026) one and\nthe same person can (\u2026) belong to several very different human\ngroups. (\u2026) the group\u2019s collective storehouse ever\nchanges and with it the criteria for truth. (\u2026) It is only in\nrelation to the collective stores of the group in question that we can\ndenote a state of affairs as correct or as a personal error\u201d\n(following Schnelle 1986, p. 9). However, Fleck does not mention any\nof these scholars in his writings, even though they created the\nthought style and intellectual mood that, according to his views, were\nnecessary for his sociology and philosophy of science to emerge. \n\n(3) Before World War II, Lvov had a \u201cphilosophical branch\u201d\nof a distinguished mathematical-philosophical school\u2014the\nLvov-Warsaw School. Despite the fact that Fleck had connections with\nthis school, he never mentioned either Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz or Leon\nChwistek, even though Chwistek\u2019s idea of the multiplicity of\nreality (in art but also in life and science) has much in common with\nhis theory of thought styles. In his writings Fleck makes a few\ncritical remarks on conventionalists and logical empiricists; however,\nnothing really supports the claim that he knew their views well. Also,\nFleck\u2019s remarks on epistemology of Kant, Mach, Wundt and\nUexk\u00fcll\u2019s are superficial and dispersed\u2014he does not\nadopt views from them, but only looks for some superficial\nconfirmation of his own claims. Thus, we cannot include Fleck among\nany esoteric philosophical circles.\n\n(4) In (1935a) Fleck devotes only a few pages to the sociology of\nknowledge, and, moreover, he refers exclusively to the German\ntranslation of Lucien Levy-Bruhl\u2019s book Das Denken der\nNaturv\u00f6lker, 1921 and to Wilhelm Jerusalem\u2019s paper of\n1929. Clearly he did not know works of the \u201cfounders of\nsociology of knowledge\u201d: Max Scheler and Karl Mannheim. Schnelle\n(1986) even claims that Fleck had acquired the basic information on\nthe sociology of science from a popular paper published in Polish by\nPawe\u0142 Rybicki. When Fleck mentions the works of Durkheim, Levy\nBruhl, Jerusalem or Gumplowicz, he does this superficially; he does\nnot adopt any of their conceptions and is content with a general\nthesis that \u201cWhat actually thinks within a person is not the\nindividual himself but his social community\u201d (Gumplowicz; quot.\nfrom Fleck 1935a, \u00a7 II.4). Fleck accuses them of ignoring the\nresults of their research into the beliefs of traditional societies\nonce they turn to scientific thinking, where they hold that\n\u201cperceptions proper\u201d displace mythical elements, and a\ntraditional conviction on the existence of spirits and daemons is\nreplaced with justified beliefs about \u201cwhat physically is\npossible or impossible\u201d (Levy-Bruhl, quot. from Fleck 1935a,\n\u00a7 II.4). In contrast, Fleck claims that scientific thinking is an\nobject of sociological examination to the same extent as mythical\nthinking.\n\nAn interesting hypothesis was recently formulated by Eva Hedfors\n(2006), who critically evaluated Fleck\u2019s competencies in the\nhistory of medicine. She claims that the chief role in the development\nof his thought was played by the interdisciplinary journal Die\nNaturwissenschaften, where on the turn of the 1920s and 1930s\nscientists and philosophers carried out a philosophical debate about\nthe relativistic and quantum revolution in physics. According to\nHedfors this debate inspired Fleck, who wrote on the \u201cphysics of\ntomorrow\u201d:\n\nAt the present time we are so fortunate as to witness the spectacle of\nthe birth, the creation, of a new style of thinking. (\u2026) Sooner\nor later much will change: the law of causality, the concepts of\nobjectivity and subjectivity. Something else will be demanded from\nscientific solutions and different problems will be regarded as\nimportant. Much that has been proven will be found unproven, and much\nof what was never proven will turn out to be superfluous (Fleck 1929).\n\n\nAs Fleck\u2014because of the lack of education in this\narea\u2014could not write about physics, he found corresponding\nepisodes in the history of medicine with which he illustrated theses\ncirculating in the thought collective of physicists who were debating\nwhat was happening in their discipline.\n",
