    "main_text": "What is Social Epistemology?\n1. What is Social Epistemology?\n\nEpistemology is concerned with how people should go about the business\nof determining what is true. Social epistemology is concerned with how\npeople can best pursue the truth with the help of, or\nsometimes in the face of, other people or relevant social\npractices and institutions. It is also concerned with the pursuit of\ntruth by groups, or collective agents.\n\nThe most influential tradition in (Western) epistemology, best\nexemplified by Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1637), has focused almost\nexclusively on how individual epistemic agents, using their own\ncognitive faculties, can soundly pursue truth. Descartes contended\nthat the most promising way to do so is by use of one\u2019s own\nreasoning, as applied to one\u2019s own \u201cclear and\ndistinct\u201d ideas. The central challenge for this approach is to\nshow how one can discern what is true using only this restricted\nbasis. Even early empiricists such as John Locke (1690) also insisted\nthat knowledge be acquired through intellectual self-reliance. As\nLocke put it, \u201cother men\u2019s opinions floating in\none\u2019s brain\u201d do not constitute genuine knowledge.\n\nIn contrast with the individualistic orientations of Descartes and\nLocke, social epistemology proceeds on the idea that we often rely on\nothers in our pursuit of truth. Accordingly, social\nepistemology\u2019s core questions revolve around the nature, scope,\nand epistemic significance of this reliance: what are the ways we rely\non others when seeking information, and how does our relying on others\nin these ways bear on the epistemic goodness of our resulting beliefs?\n(See Greco (2021) for an informative discussion of both of these\nquestions.)\n\nSince epistemology itself emerged in the modern period along with the\nrise of science, where reliance on others (in replication and\nelsewhere) is pervasive, one might wonder why social epistemology has\nonly really come into its own in the last few decades. One possible\nexplanation may lie in the individualistic self-understanding of early\nmodern science: the Royal Society of London, created in 1660 to\nsupport and promote scientific inquiry, had as its motto\n\u201cNullius in verba\u201d\u2014roughly, \u201ctake no\none\u2019s word for it.\u201d Another important factor appears to\nhave been the centrality philosophers have traditionally ascribed to\nthe problem of skepticism. Such an orientation presents the pursuit of\ntruth as a solitary endeavor, where epistemology itself centers on the\nchallenges and practices of individual agents. Still, once\nindividualism in epistemology is called into question, we will see\nthat there are important connections between social epistemology and\nphilosophy of science.\n",
