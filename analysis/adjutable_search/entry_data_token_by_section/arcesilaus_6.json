    "main_text": "The practical criterion\n5. The practical criterion\n\n\nThe third doctrine we might ascribe to Arcesilaus on the basis of\nhis sources is a so-called practical criterion, i.e., a theory that\nmakes action without assent possible (see [iii] in sect. 2).\n\u00a0Arcesilaus\u2019 argument for a \u2018practical\ncriterion\u2019 responds to two Stoic objections of\n\u2018inaction\u2019 (apraxia). The first, found in\nPlutarch, is that action is impossible without assent, since action is\ncaused by assent to an impression of something suited to the agent\u2019s\nnature, i.e., \u2018oikeion\u2019 (Against\nColotes 1122a\u2013d; cf. Cicero Academica\n2.37\u20138). The second objection, reported by Sextus, is that a good\nor successful life is impossible without assent, since a good life\nrequires action based on knowledge of what is good and bad, and hence\nassent (M. 7.158; cf. Cicero Academica 2.39).\nArcesilaus\u2019 reported replies to these objections are brief, and\naccordingly difficult to interpret (see Bett 1989). His counter to the\nfirst objection is the suggestion that action is possible without\nassent, since even on the Stoic account animal action is triggered\ndirectly by their impressions of something oikeion: the\naddition of assent, and so a belief that the object is in fact\nnaturally suited to the agent, is redundant and liable to be a\ncause of error. In response to the second objection, Arcesilaus argued\nthat the person who suspends assent universally will successfully guide\ntheir actions in light of their sense of what is\n\u2018reasonable\u2019 (\u2018eulogon\u2019).\n\n\nThe three doctrinal interpretations of Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism under consideration take these arguments in Plutarch and Sextus to support, in different ways, their distinct views of his commitment to inapprehensibility and/or universal suspension.\n",
