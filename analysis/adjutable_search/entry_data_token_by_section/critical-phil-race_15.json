    "main_text": "The Question of Causes: Capitalism or Culture || Race and Class\n4.1 Race and Class\n\nRacism is very profitable. It can work to reduce compensation for\njobs designated \u201cunskilled\u201d or \u201clow skilled\u201d\nbecause the articulation of \u201cskill\u201d values mental over\nmanual labor and often misrepresents the complex demands of the latter.\nRacist prejudices incline some to accept the idea without examination\nthat the labor done by racialized groups is unskilled. All manual\nworkers are disrespected and shut out of decision making, but the\nracial organization of the labor market makes this sector more\nnon-white than other sectors, and in some locations, such as Latin\nAmerica or South Africa, almost entirely non-white. Racial divisions\namong workers are regularly exploited by capitalists to diminish\nsolidarity. Neo-colonialism in the global south continues to facilitate\nthe exploitation of labor in countries too desperately poor to\nnegotiate terms very effectively. In truth, then, both national and\ntransnational markets in labor and goods have been racially organized\nsince the Conquest of the Americas for the benefit of elites. Even when\nthe elite class is multi-racial, they benefit from the racist system of\norganizing and remunerating labor. This is the meaning of the term\n\u201cracial capitalism\u201d (Robinson 1983; Mills 1997).\n\nClearly, emerging capitalism made use of the racist ideologies\ninitiated in the early days of colonialism, such as the idea that\nNative peoples and African peoples exist in an earlier stage of human\ndevelopment and are thus legitimately subject to governance and control\nby more advanced or developed human cultures (Grosfoguel and\nCervantes-Rodr\u00edguez 2002; Quijano 2008). Capitalism also profits\nfrom the denigration of the value of indigenous cultures around the\nworld, especially when these thwart mining, logging, or other types of\nresource extraction and the transformation of environments upon which\ngroups depend for their subsistence. On the other hand, some argue that\nbecause capitalism has no intrinsic need to respect cultural\ntraditions, it often upends traditions involving racism and sexism when\nthese conflict with its labor needs: for example, the profit motive\nencourages hiring the best from any group for its\nprofessional/managerial and creative teams. One of the prime features\nof capital markets is their tendency to disrupt existing social\nconventions. These points have raised debate over whether capitalism is\nnecessarily committed to the maintenance of racism. And\nfurther debate has arisen over whether racist ideologies are intrinsic\nto cultures or to economies, or both.\n\nMost critical theorists of race and ethnicity argue for an expansion\nbeyond economic analyses. Ella Shohat and Robert Stam hold that\n\u201cWhile political economy is absolutely essential to any\nsubstantive left critique, it is also important to articulate culture\nand economy together, to conceive of them as existing in and through\neach other\u201d (2016, 421). In this vein, the cultural theorist\nStuart Hall developed what he called a heterodox Marxist approach to\nrace, emphasizing the role of culture in producing the hegemony\nrequired to maintain the racial organization of labor (Mills 2010,\n186). Yet Hall rejected the idea that culture operates as a sufficient\ncause or is separable from material conditions (Hall 1980 [2002], 1997a, 1997;\nMorley and Chen 1996). Hall\u2019s approach to the importance of\nculture in regard to racism was inspired by 20th century\nMarxist theorists such as Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser and those\nassociated with the Frankfurt School, although these theorists avoided\naddressing race. Some did address anti-Semitism and the links between\nthe rise of authoritarian societies and the forms of group hatred the\nNazi\u2019s promoted, but they wrote little about racism or\ncolonialism (Allen 2016; Farr 2018). Hall suggests however that\nGramsci\u2019s origins in southern Italy informed his understanding of\nhow regional ethnic identities could animate prejudice and play a\nformative role in the crafting of hegemony.\n \n Gramsci\u2019s concept of hegemony focused on the ways in which\nbroad majorities come to accept significant income inequality and\ndiminished democracy, reducing the need for capitalist states to use\nbrute force.  Gramsci suggested we must reach beyond economic motives\nto explain the success of hegemony. To avoid a mono-causal approach to\nracial domination, Hall adapted three concepts from Gramsci and\nAlthusser: hegemony (the production of cross-class acceptance of\nsocial injustice), relative autonomy (for cultural forces that\nsometimes operate autonomously from profit maximization), and\noverdetermination (the necessity \u201cto grasp the multiplicity of\nsocial determinations in play \u2013 and the fact that they work in\ncombination, as an articulation of different forces\u201d [Hall 2017,\n90]). For Hall, the significance of this overall approach is to alert\nus to potential misalignments between causative elements, so that the\npower of social determinism is understood to have some\ninstability. Further, we can see how non-economic motives can drive\nthe choices of both workers and capitalists. One may be motivated to\nmaintain one\u2019s social position in a racial hierarchy, for\nexample, and to ensure that racial groups considered lesser are not\ngaining social and economic advantages, even if this compromises\none\u2019s ability to fight capital.\n\nHowever, if we assume that racial identities are epiphenomenal\nillusions or imaginary in some sense, such motives will fall under the\ncategory of false consciousness, in which case race-based motivations\nwill not challenge economic determinism. One\u2019s \u201creal\u201d\n\ninterests as a worker will continue to lay in opposing racial\ndivisions. As discussed earlier in this entry, the idea that racial\nconcepts are illusory may seem to have good evidentiary grounds. Yet\nracial categories that operated within the emerging settler states,\nsuch as the United States and Australia, distributed significant\nprivileges and protections by race. These included both economic and\npolitical rights, including homestead rights, voting rights, and labor\nrights. In this way, socially created kinds such as racial identities\nhad a powerful social reality: even if some of the ideas about such\nidentities are false, real historical events produced shared\nexperiences and shared sets of interests (Beltr\u00e1n 2020).\n \n\nThe fact that racial groups are led to compete with one another for\neconomic advantages is itself socially engineered rather than natural,\nbut it may have heterogeneous causes. The concept of overdetermination\nallows us to expand the concept of what is in one\u2019s rational\n\u201cinterest\u201d to include pride and self-regard, group\nself-affirmation, relational advantage over other groups, the desire to\nenact domination and to protect longstanding special entitlements. Is\nthe imbrication of this complex array of motives such that we should\nsee the economic as the main determinant, operating behind what look to\nbe identity-protections? In other words, are racist motives ultimately\ncaused by a choice structure crafted by capitalists?\n",
