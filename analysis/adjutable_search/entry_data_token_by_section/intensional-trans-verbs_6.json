    "main_text": "Prior\u2019s Puzzle\n7. The logic of intensional transitives\n\nThere may be no such topic as the logic of propositional\nattitudes: it may be doubted whether \u2018Mary wants to meet a man\nwho has read Proust and a man who has read Gide\u2019\nlogically entails \u2018Mary wants to meet a man who has\nread Proust\u2019. Even if standing in the wanting-to-be-true\nattitude to I meet a man who has read Proust and a man who has\nread Gide somehow necessitates standing in the wanting-to-be-true\nattitude to I meet a man who has read Proust, the\nnecessitation appears to be more psychological than logical. On the\nother hand, what we might call \u2018objectual attitudes\u2019, the\nnon-propositional attitudes ascribed by intensional transitives, seem\nto have a logic (for a compendium of examples, see Richard 2000,\n105\u20137): \u2018Mary seeks a man who has read Proust and a man\nwho has read Gide\u2019 does seem to entail \u2018Mary seeks a man\nwho has read Proust\u2019.\n\nYet, as Richard notes (Richard 2001, 107\u20138), the inferential\nbehavior of quantified complements of intensional transitives is still\nvery different from the extensional case. For example (his\n\u2018Literary Example\u2019), even if it is true that Mary seeks a\nman who has read Proust and a man who has read Gide, it may be false\nboth that she seeks at most one man and that she seeks at least two\nmen; for she may be indifferent between finding a man who has read\nboth, versus finding two men, one a reader of Proust but not Gide, the\nother of Gide but not Proust. Contrast \u2018saw\u2019,\n\u2018photographed\u2019, or \u2018met\u2019: if she met a man who\nhas read Proust and a man who has read Gide, it cannot be false both\nthat she met at most at one man and also that she met at least two\nmen. As Richard insists, it is a constraint on any semantics of\nintensional transitives that they get this type of case right.\n\nBy contrast, in other cases, even very simple ones, it is\ncontroversial exactly what inferences intensional transitives in\nunspecific readings support. If Mary seeks a man who has read Proust,\ndoes it follow that she seeks a man who can read? After all, it is\nunlikely that a comic-book reader will satisfy her tastes in\n men.[10]\n If Perseus seeks a mortal gorgon, does it follow that he seeks a\n gorgon?[11]\n After all, if he finds an immortal gorgon, he is in trouble.\nZimmerman (1993, 173) takes it to be a requirement on accounts of\nnotional readings that they validate these deletion or\n\u201cweakening\u201d inferences. But there are characterizations of\nunspecific readings on which these inferences are in fact invalid, for\ninstance, a characterization in terms of indifference towards\nwhich object of the relevant kind is found (Lewis uses such an\n\u2018any one would do\u2019 characterization in Lewis 1972, p.\n199). For even if it is true that Mary seeks a man who has read\nProust, and any male Proust-reader would do, it does not follow that\nMary seeks a man who can read, and any man who can read would do. For\nnot every man who can read has read Proust.\n\nIs there anything intrinsic to the indifference characterization of\nunspecificity (\u2018any one would do\u2019) that we can object to\nwhile leaving the status of weakening inferences open? One objection\nis that the characterization does not work for every verb or\nquantifier: \u2018Guercino painted a dog, any dog would do\u2019\nmakes little sense, and \u2018the police are looking for everyone who\nwas in the room, any people who were in the room would do\u2019 is\nnot much better. More importantly, the characterization seems to put\nwarranted assertibility out of reach, since the grounds which we\nnormally take to justify ascribing an existentially quantified\nobjectual attitude will rarely give reason to think that the agent has\nabsolutely no further preferences going beyond the characterization of\nthe object-kind given in the ascription (probably Mary would pass on\nmeeting a male psychopathic killer who has read Proust; see further\nGraff Fara 2013 for analogous discussion of desire).\n\nStill, this is not to validate weakening inferences; for that we would\nneed to show that the more usual gloss of the unspecific reading,\nusing a \u2018but no particular one\u2019 rider, supports the\ninferences as strongly as the indifference characterization refutes\nthem. And it is unclear how such an argument would proceed (see\nfurther Forbes 2006, 94\u20136). In addition, making a good case that\nthe inferences are intuitively valid is one thing, getting the\nsemantics to validate them is another. Both the propositionalist and\nthe Montagovian need to add extra principles, since there is nothing\nin their bare semantics to compel these inferences. For even if Jack\nstands in the wanting relation to\n^(a(woollen(sweater))), that by itself is silent on\nwhether he also stands in the wanting relation to\n^(a(sweater)). The accounts of Moltmann and Richard\nboth decide the matter positively, however (e.g., if in every minimal\nsituation in which Jack\u2019s desire is satisfied, he gets a woollen\nsweater, then in every such situation, he gets a sweater; so he wants\na sweater).\n\nThe intuitive validity of weakening can also be directly challenged.\nFor example, via weakening we can infer that if A is looking for a cat\nand B is looking for a dog, then A and B are looking for the same\nthing (an animal). For discussion of this kind of example, see\n(Zimmerman 2006), and for the special use of \u2018the same\nthing\u2019, (Moltmann 2008). Asher (1987, 171) proposes an even more\ndirect counterexample. Suppose you enter a competition whose prize is\na free ticket on the Concorde to New York. So presumably you want\na free ticket on the Concorde. But you don\u2019t want a\nticket on the Concorde, since you know that normally these are\nvery expensive, you are poor, and you strictly resist desiring the\nunattainable. Asher is here assimilating notional uses of indefinites\nto generics, which on his account involve quantification over\nnormal worlds. So if for some bizarre reason you want a\nsloop, but one whose hull is riddled with holes, it will not be\nliterally true to say you want a sloop.\n\nUndeniably there is a real phenomenon here, but perhaps it belongs to\npragmatics rather than semantics. If I say \u2018I want a sloop\u2019,\nsomeone who offers to buy me any sloop floating in the harbor could\nreasonably complain \u2018You should have said that\u2019 if I decline the\noffer on the grounds that none of those sloops meets my unstated\nrequirement of having a hull riddled with holes. But my aspirational\nbenefactor\u2019s complaint might be justified because normality is a\ndefault implicature or presupposition that a co-operative\nspeaker is under some obligation to let her audience know isn\u2019t in\nforce, when it isn\u2019t. It is still literally true, on this view, that\nyou want a sloop, despite the idiosyncrasy of the details of your\ndesire. However, this is far from the end of the story. Those with\ndoubts about weakening will find the discussion in (Sainsbury 2018,\n129\u2013133) congenial.\n\nAnother interesting logical problem concerns the \u201cconjunctive\nforce\u201d of disjoined quantified NPs in objectual ascriptions.\nThere is a large literature on the conjunctive force of disjunction in\nmany other contexts (e.g., Kamp 1973, Loewer 1976, Makinson 1984,\nJennings 1994, Zimmerman 2000, Simons 2005, Fox 2007), for instance as\nexhibited in \u2018x is larger than y or\nz\u2019 and \u2018John can speak French or Italian to\nyou\u2019. In these cases the conjunctive force is easily captured by\nsimple distribution: \u2018x is larger than y and\nlarger than z\u2019, \u2018John can speak French to you and\ncan speak Italian to\n you\u2019.[12]\n However, with intensional transitives we find the same conjunctive\nforce, but no distributive articulation. If we say that Jack needs a\nwoollen sweater or a fleece jacket, we say something to the effect\nthat (i) his getting a woollen sweater is one way his need could be\nmet, and (ii) his getting a fleece jacket is another way his\nneed could be met. But \u2018Jack needs a woollen sweater or a fleece\njacket\u2019 does not mean that Jack needs a woollen sweater\nand needs a fleece jacket. This last conjunction ascribes two\nneeds, only one of which is met by getting a satisfactory woollen\nsweater. But the latter acquisition by itself meets the disjunctive\nneed for a woollen sweater or a fleece jacket. So there is a challenge\nto explain the semantics of the disjunctive ascription, while at the\nsame time remaining within a framework that can accommodate all cases\nof conjunctive force \u2014 comparatives, various senses of\n\u2018can\u2019, counterfactuals with disjunctive antecedents\n(\u2018if Jack were to put on a woollen sweater or a fleece jacket\nhe\u2019d be warmer\u2019) and so on; see further (Forbes 2006,\n97\u2013111).\n\nA penultimate type of inference we will mention is one in which\nintensional and extensional verbs both occur, and the inference seems\nvalid even when the intensional VPs are construed unspecifically. An\nexample:\n\n(23a)\n Jack wants a woollen sweater\n\n(23b)\n Whatever Jack wants, he gets\n\n(23c)\n Therefore, Jack will get a woollen sweater\n\n\nObviously, (23a,b) entail (23c) when (23a) is understood specifically.\nBut informants judge that the inference is also valid when (23a) is\nunderstood unspecifically, with \u2018but no particular one\u2019\nexplicitly appended. If we seek a validation of the inference that\nhews to surface form, Montague\u2019s uniform treatment of intensional and\nextensional verbs has its appeal: (23b) will say that for whatever\nproperty of properties P Jack stands in the\nwanting relation to, he stands in the getting relation to. So the\ninference is portrayed as the simple modus ponens it seems to\nbe. It would then be the task of other meaning-postulates to carry us\nfrom his standing in the getting relation to\n^(a(woollen(sweater))) to there being a woollen\nsweater such that he gets it. The final example to be considered\nhere involves fictional or mythical names in the scope of intensional\ntransitives. An example (Zalta 1988, 128) of the puzzles these can\nlead to is:\n\n\n(24a)\n The ancient Greeks worshipped Zeus.\n\n(24b)\n Zeus is a mythical character.\n\n(24c)\n Mythical characters do not exist.\n\n(24d)\n Therefore, the ancient Greeks worshipped something that does\n(did) not exist.\n\n\nOr even:\n\n(24e)\n Therefore, there is something that doesn\u2019t exist such that the\nancient Greeks worshipped it.\n\n\nOne thing the example shows is that specific/unspecific is not to be\nconfused with real/fictional. (24a) is a true specific ascription,\njust as \u2018the ancient Greeks worshipped Ahura Mazda\u2019 is a\nfalse one. (24b) is also true. So the ancient Greeks, who would not\nhave knowingly worshipped a mythical character, were making a\nrather large mistake, if one of a familiar sort.\n\n(24c) is also true, if we are careful about what \u2018do not\nexist\u2019 means in this context. It is contingent that Zeus-myths\nwere ever formulated, and one sense in which we might mean (24c) turns\non the assumption that fictional and mythical characters exist iff\nfictions and myths about them do. In this sense, (24c) is false,\nthough an actual fictional character such as Zeus would not have\nexisted if there had been no Zeus-myths. This also explains why (24a)\nand (24b) can both be true: \u2018Zeus\u2019 refers to the mythical\ncharacter, a contingently existing abstract object.\n\nHowever, by far the more likely reading of (24c) is one on which it\nmeans that mythical characters are not real. Zeus is not flesh and\nblood, not even immaterial flesh and blood. With this in mind, (24d)\nand (24e) are both true. The quantifier \u2018something\u2019 ranges\nover a domain that includes both real and fictional or mythical\nentities, and there is something in that domain, the mythical\ncharacter, which was worshipped by the ancient Greeks and which is not\nin the subdomain of real items.\n\nThis gets the right truth-values for the statements in (24), but might\nbe thought to run into trouble with the likes of \u2018Zeus lives on\nMt. Olympus\u2019: if \u2018Zeus\u2019 refers to an abstract\nobject, how can Zeus live anywhere? One way of dealing with this kind\nof case is to suppose, evidently plausibly, that someone who says\n\u2018Zeus lives on Mt. Olympus\u2019 and knows the facts means\n\n(25)\n According to the myth, Zeus lives on Mt. Olympus.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if an ancient Greek believer says \u2018Zeus lives\non Mt. Olympus\u2019, he or she says something false, there being no\nreason to posit a covert \u2018according to the myth\u2019 in this\ncase.\n\nHowever, even the covert operator theory might be contested, on the\ngrounds that within its scope we are still unintelligibly predicating\n\u2018lived on Mt. Olympus\u2019 of an abstract object. Simply\nprefixing \u2018according to the myth\u2019 to the unintelligible\ncannot render it intelligible. But there is the evident fact that (25)\nis both intelligible and true. So either prefixing \u2018according to\nthe myth\u2019 can render the unintelligible intelligible,\nor what is going on in the embedded sentence is not to be construed as\nstandard predication. For further discussion of these matters, see,\nfor example, van Inwagen 1977, Parsons 1980, Zalta 1988, Thomasson\n1998, and Salmon 2002.\n",
