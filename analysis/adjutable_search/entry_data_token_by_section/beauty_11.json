    "main_text": "The Politics of Beauty || Colonialism and Race\n3.4 Beauty and Resistance\n\nHowever, if beauty has been an element in various forms of oppression,\nit has also been an element in various forms of resistance, as the\nslogan \u201cBlack is beautiful\u201d suggests. The most compelling\nresponses to oppressive standards and uses of beauty have given rise\nto what might be termed counter-beauties. When fighting\ndiscrimination against people with disabilities, for example, one may\ndecry the oppressive norms that regard disabled bodies as ugly and\nleave it at that. Or one might try to discover what new standards of\nbeauty and subversive pleasures might arise in the attempt to regard\ndisabled bodies as beautiful (Siebers 2005). For that matter, one\nmight uncover the ways that non-normative bodies and subversive\npleasures actually do fulfill various traditional criteria of\nbeauty. Indeed, for some decades there has been a disability arts\nmovement, often associated with artists such as Christine Sun Kim and\nRiva Lehrer, which tries to do just that (see Siebers 2005).\n \nThe exploration of beauty, in some ways flipping it over into an\ninstrument of feminist resistance, or showing directly how\nwomen\u2019s beauty could be experienced outside of patriarchy, has\nbeen a theme of much art by women of the 20th and 21st\ncenturies. Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s flowers and Judy\nChicago\u2019s \u201cDinner Party\u201d place settings undertake to\nabsorb and reverse the objectifying gaze. The exploration of the\nmeaning of the female body in the work of performance artists such as\nHannah Wilke, Karen Finley, and Orlan, tries both to explore the\nobjectification of the female body and to affirm women\u2019s\nexperience in its concrete realities from the inside: to make of it\nemphatically a subject rather than an object (see Striff 1997).\n\n\u201cBeauty seems in need of rehabilitation today as an impulse that\ncan be as liberating as it has been deemed enslaving,\u201d wrote\nphilosopher Peg Zeglin Brand in 2000. \u201cConfident young women\ntoday pack their closets with mini-skirts and sensible suits. Young\nfemale artists toy with feminine stereotypes in ways that make their\nfeminist elders uncomfortable. They recognize that \u2026 beauty can\nbe a double-edged sword \u2013 as capable of destabilizing rigid\nconventions and restrictive behavioral models as it is of reinforcing\nthem\u201d (Brand 2000, xv). Indeed, vernacular norms of beauty as\nexpressed in media and advertising have shifted in virtue of the\nfeminist and anti-racist attacks on dominant body norms, as the\nconcept\u2019s long journey continues. \n",
