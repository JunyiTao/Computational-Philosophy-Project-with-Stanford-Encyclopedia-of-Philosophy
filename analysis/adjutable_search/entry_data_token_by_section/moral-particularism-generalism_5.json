    "main_text": "Semantic/Conceptual Arguments\n6. Practical Arguments\n\nAs the taxonomy of\n section 2 above\n emphasized, whether moral principles are necessary for moral\nunderstanding or moral explanation is not the only debate between\nparticularists and generalists. Distinct questions remain about the\nplace and value of principles in guiding moral decision-making and\naction and in interpersonal justification. Generalists typically see a\nlarger and more important role for principles to play in these\ncontexts. Particularists typically find at least some sympathy with\nDavid McNaughton\u2019s claim that moral principles are \u201cat\nbest useless and at worst a hindrance\u201d (McNaughton 1988: 191).\nIn considering this aspect of the debate, it is helpful to treat as\ncommon ground the idea that it is at least possible for an agent to be\n(in some sense) guided by a principle. This assumption has, of course,\nbeen challenged, most prominently by some readings of\nWittgenstein\u2019s arguments concerning rule-following (Kripke\n1982). If guidance by principle were utterly impossible, then\nquestions about the value and importance of principled guidance would\nbe largely moot. For similar reasons, it is helpful to assume, at\nleast provisionally, that an agent can eschew being guided by\nprinciples and yet still act rationally and for reasons and with some\nmeasure of consistency.\n\nAgainst this background, we may distinguish two questions. First, we\nmight ask whether guidance by principles constitutes a superior\nstrategy for acting well as compared to guidance by particular\njudgments untutored by principles. One familiar way to understand the\nsuperiority of a strategy is in terms of its reliability at leading an\nagent to act rightly and for morally good reasons (McKeever and Ridge\n2006; V\u00e4yrynen 2008). Second, we might ask whether guidance by\nprinciples enables us to secure morally valuable goods (or avoid\nsignificant moral evils) that would otherwise be out of reach. If\nparticularism tells us to eschew guidance by principles and if doing\nso comes with significant costs, then, to use Brad Hooker\u2019s\nphrase, there is something \u201cbad\u201d about particularism\n(Hooker 2000, 2008). Similarly, if generalism tells us to use\nprinciples and this has serious costs, then there is something bad\nabout generalism.\n\nThese questions leave one familiar and related question largely to the\nside. This is the question whether there is something inherently\nmorally valuable about being a \u201cperson of principle\u201d\nindependent of the content of those principles and how, more\nspecifically, they lead one to act. Generalists may, but need not,\nsubscribe to such a view, and even particularists could (consistently\nwith holism) allow that across some range of contexts being principled\nis, itself, a favoring consideration. Turning to the first question\njust noted, how might principles constitute a good strategy for moral\naction?\n\nMost ambitiously, the ultimate principles qua\nstandards\u2014that is, the principles which provide the deepest\nexplanations of why right actions are right\u2014could be well suited\nto guiding action directly. Arguably this is the view we find in Kant\nand in many modern Kantian moral theories. The categorical imperative\nis both the ultimate standard of right action and at the same time is\nwell suited to guide the decision-making of a conscientious moral\nagent. This view of principled guidance ought to be distinguished from\na distinct meta-ethical view according to which an ultimate moral\nstandard must, if it is to be valid at all, be such that agents can be\n(in some sense) guided by it (Bales 1971; Smith 2012). Such a view may\nbe attractive to those (such as Kant) who think that moral principles\nmust comport with autonomy and that morality is a species of\nrationality. It may also be attractive to those who believe that moral\nprinciples must provide reasons on which agents can act. But even a\nvery ambitious generalist model of principled guidance need not\nsubscribe to this meta-ethical view. Kant, at least in some passages,\nencourages optimism about our ability to apply the ultimate standard\nof right and wrong directly to our individual decisions. Other\nphilosophers within the generalist tradition, such as Ross, defend\nprinciples which look, on their face, to be eminently usable, and if\nRoss is correct that such principles are ultimate standards, then one\nmight feel entitled at least to a weak presumption in favour of the\nclaim that using them would be a good strategy.\n\nWhen we consider other candidates for the ultimate moral principle,\nhowever, many find reasons to be sceptical that the ambitious model\njust canvassed will carry us very far. This has been a recurring worry\nfor act consequentialism and, for that reason, many of the most\ninfluential attempts to deal with it have emerged from philosophers\nworking in that tradition. The basic idea is that the consequences of\nour action are so many, so various, and (often) so far reaching that\nagents cannot figure out in a timely fashion what the right act is by\ndirectly using a consequentialist principle. Using the\nconsequentialist principle in this sense must of course include\ngathering the facts about the consequences, not just applying the\nprinciples to the facts as one believes or knows them to be. (For\ndiscussion of weaker and stronger senses in which an agent might\n\u201cuse\u201d a principle, see Smith 2012.) Properly understood,\nthe worry here is not that the act consequentialist principle provides\nno guidance whatsoever; it may point quite clearly to the kinds of\ninformation that must be gathered and heeded. The worry is that\nattempts to follow the principle will not reliably lead to morally\nright action. Moreover, the worry is not simply that the principle\nfails to constitute a complete and reliable strategy. Any model of\nprincipled guidance\u2014even one such as Kant\u2019s\u2014is\nliable to require that we rely also on cognitive and emotional powers\nthat go beyond the principle itself. The worry is that our normal\ncognitive and emotional powers together with the principle do not\nyield a reliable strategy for performing morally right actions.\n\nInstead of concluding that principled guidance is hopeless, many act\nconsequentialists have instead proposed that we replace the project of\nbeing guided by the ultimate moral standard (assuming this for the\nmoment to be some form of act consequentialism) and instead be guided\nby some more tractable set of principles. According to such\n\u201cindirect\u201d consequentialism, the principles we typically\nemploy in deliberation are not the ultimate standards of right\nconduct. However, an agent who employs them in deliberation will\nregularly and systematically act rightly. Such proposals have been a\nstaple of consequentialist thinking dating back at least to the work\nof Mill and Sidgwick. An especially well known recent version of the\nidea is defended by R.M. Hare, who calls reliance on such principles\n\u201cintuitive moral thinking\u201d. By contrast, \u201ccritical\nmoral thinking\u201d proceeds in terms of the actual standards of\nmoral conduct (Hare 1981). Importantly, neither indirect models of\nprincipled guidance nor the worry that inspires them need be married\nto a consequentialist view of moral standards. Kantian moral\nphilosophers have sometimes stressed the need for\n\u201cmid-level\u201d principles (Hill 1989, 1992). Even\nparticularists about standards could consistently embrace the use of\nsuch an indirect strategy and so embrace a kind of generalism about\nmoral guidance, though so far as we know no one has actually adopted\nthis position.\n\nDiscussions of indirect consequentialism often proceed as if the\ncorrect moral standard could, in principle, be applied directly to any\ngiven circumstance and, if so applied, would indicate the morally\nright action(s) to take. Leaving aside whether this is true of (some)\nconsequentialist principles, many claim that it is not true of other\ncandidate moral standards. Consider, for example, principles such as\n\u201call persons must be treated as moral equals\u201d, or\n\u201cproperty rights must be respected\u201d, or, to borrow a less\nmorally loaded example from Onora O\u2019Neill, \u201cteachers must\nassign work appropriate to their students\u2019 abilities\u201d\n(O\u2019Neill 1996: 73\u201377). Such principles may not yield\ndeterminate guidance in concrete circumstances even given a full array\nof non-moral facts. To be properly applied, such principles may\nrequire additional moral judgment. We must determine just\nwhich individuals are persons and what it is to treat persons as moral\nequals. We must determine which claims to property correspond to valid\nrights and what invasions of property amount to a failure to respect\nthose rights. May an exhausted runner harmlessly trespass in order to\ncool off beneath the shade of another person\u2019s tree? We must\neven decide how difficult is too difficult when it comes to\nchallenging students. The obstacle to using the standard as a direct\nguide to conduct is not that our cognitive resources come up short,\nbut that the standard is itself not yet sufficiently determinate. This\nsituation presents an opportunity for principles to play a guiding\nrole by helping to fill in the normative content of higher level\nstandards. (Whether such guiding principles would themselves count as\nnon-ultimate standards is a question we here set aside.) Importantly,\nhowever, guiding principles in this sense need not make fully\ndeterminate the higher level principles that they help to fill out.\nThey may, instead, explicitly identify further questions to be\nsettled\u2014whether by other principles or by judgment. For example,\nthe principle that a duly convicted criminal ought to receive only the\namount of punishment he deserves is highly abstract. How ought we to\ndetermine whether a punishment is deserved? The further principle that\nthe punishment ought to be proportional to the crime may direct us to\nfind a way to proportionately rank less and more serious crimes, and\nit may thus point us part, but not all, of the way towards complying\nwith the higher level principle.\n\nWe now have at least three accounts of how principles might\nfigure in a reliable strategy for acting well. But why think that\nprinciples do or must figure in the best strategies for moral action?\nOr, taking the other side, why think that principles are useless or\neven counterproductive? If one could establish or assume a specific\ngeneralist account of moral standards, this would open up many lines\nof argument for guidance by principle. The same would be true if one\ncould establish particularism about standards. However, such\nassumptions are not dialectically available in the\ngeneralism/particularism debate. Accordingly, we here focus on\narguments that are largely neutral about the content of the moral\ndomain and whether it is \u201cprincipled\u201d.\n\nSome generalists argue that moral principles help avoid \u201cspecial\npleading\u201d\u2014interpreting one\u2019s moral duties in ways\nthat favour one\u2019s own interests and in ways that go beyond what\na reasonable accommodation of self-interest would allow. Agents who\nengage in special pleading do not do so consciously, but rather think\nthey are impartially assessing what morality demands in their\ncircumstances. The adoption of moral principles might be thought to\nhelp with this problem. For one thing, principles can be adopted and\ninternalized well before any conflict with the agent\u2019s interests\narises. Having internalized the relevant principle well in advance may\nmake it easier to avoid special pleading when a conflict does arise\n(cf. McKeever and Ridge 2006: 202\u2013203). Furthermore, a practice\nof articulating these principles publicly endows them with symbolic\nmeaning. Violating explicitly endorsed principles or adding caveats in\nan ad hoc manner to suit one\u2019s interests can come to\nstand for our lacking the right kind of commitment to morality more\ngenerally (see Nozick 1993: 29; McKeever and Ridge 2006:\n204\u2013205). Anecdotally, some people seem to think New\nYears\u2019 resolutions work in this way, and George Ainslie has\nprovided a body of empirical evidence that such public resolutions can\nhelp motivate agents to (e.g.) stop smoking in a way that somehow\nprevents the thought that \u201cone cigarette won\u2019t make any\nnon-negligible difference\u201d from undermining their resolve\n(Ainslie 1975 and Ainslie 1986).\n\nParticularists agree that special pleading is a problem but they do\nnot think that principles afford the proper solution to that problem.\nInstead, they typically suggest that one simply needs to \u201clook\nharder\u201d at the case at hand to avoid such special pleading:\n\n\n\u2026the remedy for poor moral judgment is not a different style of\nmoral judgment, principle-based judgment, but just better moral\njudgment. There is only one real way to stop oneself distorting things\nin one\u2019s favour, and that is to look again, as hard as one can,\nat the reasons present in the case, and see if really one is so\ndifferent from others that what would be required of them is not\nrequired of oneself. The method is not infallible, I know; but then\nnor was the appeal to principle. (Dancy 2013)\n\n\nGeneralists worry that the exhortation to look again is simply\nunrealistic, given human nature, and is therefore not only fallible\nbut unlikely to do much good. If so, then even if principles are far\nfrom infallible rejecting them wholesale is premature. The best way to\navoid special pleading could involve an array of more specific\nstrategies with principles playing some significant role.\n\nOn the other side particularists worry that reliance on principles\nbreeds inflexibility and a problematic tendency to shoehorn a\nmorally complex situation into some more familiar set of categories.\nMcNaughton describes such inflexibility as a \u201cserious\nvice\u201d and claims that reliance on principles is partly to blame\n(McNaughton 1988: 203). Dancy remarks that,\n\n\nWe all know the sort of person who refuses to make the decision here\nthat the facts are obviously calling for, because he cannot see how to\nmake that decision consistent with one he made on a different\noccasion. (Dancy 1993: 64)\n\n\nImportantly, this worry cannot be dismissed simply on the grounds that\ngeneralists can (and do) allow judgment to also play a role in our use\nand application of principles; the worry is that the use of principles\nhas a distorting influence of its own. One interesting and empirically\nminded proposal for evaluating the force of the particularist\u2019s\nconcern looks to the literature on the comparative success of rules\nand expert judgment in other domains (Zamzow 2015). Much of this\nliterature suggests that rules outperform expert judgment (see Grove\net al. 2000).\n\nLet us turn now to a second family of arguments for principled\nguidance. Setting aside whether principles are a winning strategy for\nthe individual aiming at virtuous action, one might think that our\ncollective use of principles enables us to achieve morally valuable\ngoods. One such argument appeals to the value of predictability\n(Hooker 2000, 2008). Successful cooperation and coordination yield\nenormous benefits yet it requires an ability to predict the behaviour\nof others and a willingness to rely on those predictions when making\none\u2019s own choices. If principled guidance supports\npredictability, so much the better for principles. Not surprisingly,\nparticularists have questioned whether principles are necessary for\npredictability. \u201cPeople are quite capable of judging how to\nbehave case by case, and in a way that would enable us to predict what\nthey will in fact do\u201d (Dancy 2004: 83). The key issue is\ncomparative. Is the person guided by principles thereby more\npredictable than the person who eschews principles? Someone who\nrejects moral rules altogether and always just tries to judge each\ncase on its own merits plausibly is less predictable than someone who\nhas internalized and follows a set of moral principles. But as we saw\nabove, assessing the force of this generalist argument would benefit\nfrom consideration of careful empirical research. One challenge for\ngeneralists who might further develop this argument is that it stands\nin some tension with other themes stressed by generalists, for\nexample, that principles can incorporate various hedges and so exhibit\nthe kind of flexibility particularists embrace (V\u00e4yrynen 2008)\nand that principles are often indeterminate and must be supplemented\nby judgment. To be consistent, generalists will need to show not only\nthat guidance by crude principles makes one more predictable, but that\nguidance by a combination of hedged principles and judgment makes one\nmore predictable than guidance by judgment alone.\n\nA very different practical argument for generalism has roots in the\nKantian tradition and has recently been advanced by Stephen Darwall\n(2013, see also Darwall 2006). He contends that publicly formulable\nprinciples are necessary for us to realize a valuable form of\ninterpersonal accountability in our shared moral life. He further\nargues that such accountability is necessary for moral obligations\n(though not necessarily for moral reasons). Within the framework here\ndeveloped, one might see Darwall\u2019s argument as a defense of\ngeneralism about standards but with the argument restricted\nto standards of moral obligation. Alternatively, one might\nsee it as a practical argument for attempting to formulate shared\npublic principles because, if we fail to do so (or fail to continue to\ndo so), we will lose something that we take to be valuable about\nmorality, namely the respect for persons that is inherent in a\npractice of interpersonal accountability (Darwall 2013: especially\n183\u2013191). Darwall\u2019s argument fits very well with Kantian\ncontractualism of the sort defended by T.M. Scanlon, which emphasizes\nthe value of our being able to justify ourselves to others and sees\nprinciples as mediating justification. It might also be instructive to\ncompare Darwall\u2019s argument with some of the ideas found in the\ntradition of discourse ethics associated with J\u00fcrgen Habermas\n(see, e.g., Habermas 1990). An important challenge for this argument\nis to persuasively establish the premise that accountability (or\ninterpersonal justification) must advert to principles. Particularists\nmay allow that accountability is an important value while urging that\nthe interpersonal process of holding one another accountable can\nproceed entirely in terms of the reasons, defeaters, enablers, and\nintensifiers that are at play in the case at hand.\n",
