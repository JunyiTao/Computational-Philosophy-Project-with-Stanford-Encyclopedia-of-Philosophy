    "main_text": "\n\n\nGerhard (Gershom) Scholem (1897\u20131982) was the preeminent modern\nscholar of Jewish mysticism. Of Scholem Martin Buber once remarked,\n\u201call of us have students, schools, but only Gershom Scholem has\ncreated a whole academic discipline!\u201d His contribution lay in\nfive distinct yet connected areas which will be detailed below: the\nresearch and analysis of kabbalistic literature spanning from late\nantiquity to the twentieth century; the phenomenology of mystical\nreligion; Jewish historiography; Zionism, and the spiritual and\npolitical condition of contemporary Judaism and Jewish civilization. He\npublished over 40 volumes and close to 700 articles almost all of which\nare listed in the Scholem Bibliography published in 1977. He trained at\nleast three generations of scholars of Kabbala many of whom still teach\nin Israel and the Diaspora. Scholem was also part of a select group of\nGerman-Jewish intellectuals from the Weimar period who rejected their\nparents' assimilationist liberal lives in favor of Zionism. He\nimmigrated to Palestine in 1923 and quickly became a central figure in\nthe German-Jewish immigrant community that dominated the intellectual\nlandscape in Mandate Palestine from the 1920's until the Second\nWorld War.\n",
