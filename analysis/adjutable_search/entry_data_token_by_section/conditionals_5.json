But by Hook\u2019s lights, you may well be wrong;\nfor it may not be a pentagon, and in that case it is true that if\nit\u2019s a pentagon, it has six sides. \n\nAnother example, due to Gibbard (1981, pp. 235\u20136): of a glass\nthat had been held a foot above the floor, you say (having left the\nscene) \u201cIf it broke if it was dropped, it was fragile\u201d.\nIntuitively this seems reasonable. But by Hook\u2019s lights, if the\nglass was not dropped, and was not fragile, the conditional has a true\n(conditional) antecedent and false consequent, and is hence false.\n\nGrice\u2019s strategy was to explain why we don\u2019t assert\ncertain conditionals which (by Hook\u2019s lights) we have reason to\nbelieve true. In the above two cases, the problem is reversed: there\nare compounds of conditionals which we confidently assert and accept\nwhich, by Hook\u2019s lights, we do not have reason to believe\ntrue.\n\nAnother bad result is that according to Hook, the following is a valid\nargument:\n\nIf \\(A \\amp B, C\\); therefore, either, if \\(A, C\\), or, if \\(B, C\\).\n\n\nEven in mathematics, this looks wrong. Said of an unseen plane figure:\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a triangle and it\u2019s equiangular, it\u2019s\nequilateral; therefore, either, if it\u2019s a triangle it\u2019s\nequilateral, or, if it\u2019s equiangular it\u2019s\nequilateral\u201d. (I owe this example to Alberto Mura.)\n\nThe above examples are not a problem for Arrow. But other cases of\nembedded conditionals count in the opposite direction. Here are two\nsentence forms which are, intuitively, equivalent:\n\nIf \\((A \\amp B), C\\).\nIf \\(A\\), then if \\(B, C\\).\n\n\n(Following Vann McGee (1989) I\u2019ll call the principle that (i)\nand (ii) are equivalent the Import-Export Principle, or\n\u201cImport-Export\u201d for short.) Try any example: \u201cIf\nMary comes then if John doesn\u2019t have to leave early we will play\nBridge\u201d; \u201cIf Mary comes and John doesn\u2019t have to\nleave early we will play Bridge\u201d. \u201cIf they were outside\nand it rained, they got wet\u201d; \u201cIf they were outside, then\nif it rained, they got wet\u201d. For Hook, Import-Export holds.\n(Exercise: do a truth table, or construct a proof.) Gibbard (1981, pp.\n234\u20135) has proved that for no conditional with truth conditions\nstronger than \\(\\supset\\) does Import-Export hold. Assume\nImport-Export holds for some reading of \u201cif\u201d. The key to\nthe proof is to consider the formula\n\nIf \\((A \\supset B)\\) then (if \\(A,B)\\).\n\n\nBy Import-Export, (1) is equivalent to \n\nIf \\(((A \\supset B) \\amp A))\\) then \\(B\\).\n\n\nThe antecedent of (2) entails its consequent. So (2) is a logical\ntruth. So by Import-Export, (1) is a logical truth. On any reading of\n\u201cif\u201d, \u201cif \\(A, B\\)\u201d entails \\((A \\supset B)\\).\nSo (1) entails \n\n\\((A \\supset B) \\supset\\) (if \\(A, B)\\).\n\n\nSo (3) is a logical truth. That is, there is no possible situation in\nwhich its antecedent \\((A \\supset B)\\) is true and its consequent (if\n\\(A, B)\\) is false. That is, \\((A \\supset B)\\) entails \u201cIf \\(A,\nB\\)\u201d.\n\nNeither kind of truth condition has proved entirely satisfactory. We\nstill have to consider Jackson\u2019s defence of Hook, and\nStalnaker\u2019s response to the problem about non-truth-functional\ntruth conditions raised in \u00a72.2. These are deferred to \u00a74,\nbecause they depend on the considerations developed in \u00a73.\n",
