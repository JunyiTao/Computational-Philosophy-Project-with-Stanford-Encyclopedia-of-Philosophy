Distribution According to Need\n\n\nFor those who believe that claims of need can also be claims of\njustice, the idea that what justice requires is that resources should\nbe distributed according to need has an obvious appeal: the\nneedier someone is, the more resources they should be assigned.  Marx\nfamously wrote that in the higher state of communist society, resource\ndistribution would be governed by the principle \u2018from each\naccording to his ability, to each according to his needs\u2019 (Marx\n1977, 569). But he prefaced this by pointing out that this could\nonly happen once \u2018the productive forces have also increased with\nthe all-round development of the individual, and all the springs of\nco-operative wealth flow more abundantly\u2019\u2014that is to say,\nscarcity had been overcome. Because of this assumption, it is arguable\nwhether the principle as proposed by Marx should be seen as a\nprinciple of justice, or as a principle for a world that has moved\nbeyond the circumstances for justice (see Buchanan 1982; Lukes 1985,\nch.4; Wood 1980).\n",
