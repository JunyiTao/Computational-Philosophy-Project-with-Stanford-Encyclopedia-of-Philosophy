    "main_text": "Ethical Approaches to Reparations\n5. Ethical Approaches to Reparations\n\n\nGenerally, there are two ethical approaches that might be used to\nground or justify reparations: utilitarian versus rights-based.\nUtilitarian approaches to reparations seek to justify and articulate\nreparations in terms of equity for oppressed citizens relative to\nother citizens of a society, no matter to which, say,\n\u201cracial\u201d or ethnic groups they belong. Further, their\ncommitment to a suitably described principle of utility will attempt\nto promote rights to reparations up to a point wherein social\nutility maximization and equality amongst the citizenry are threatened\nbased on the perceived consequences of the application of a particular\nreparative policy. But this level of commitment to the rights to\nreparations is criticized for its inadequate commitment\nto honoring said rights qua rights, thereby\nsubsuming the rights to reparations under the utilitarian commitments\nto social utility considerations and equality (Corlett 2010:\n33\u201379), something the rights-based approach would reject\nconcerning rights in general (Feinberg 1980; Rawls 1999). For the\nrights-based approach to reparative justice, a right to reparations\nfashioned by social utility maximal considerations is no right at all.\nThe rights to reparations, like other rights, must be honored, not\nmerely promoted in accordance with the ethics of a utilitarian\ncalculation. For if X is a right at all, X as a\nright trumps social utility considerations.\n\nFor the rights-based approach to reparations, such rights include at\nleast the following rights-cluster: The set of rights to corrective\njustice honored in proportion to the wrongful harm experienced by\neither the proximate cause of the harm caused to the group or to the\ngroup responsible for honoring the reparations in question. It is\nimportant to note that a group can be responsible for compensating a\nharm without that group being guilty of causing the harm (Feinberg\n1970). Hence in the case under consideration, the U.S. government is\nsaid to owe reparations to U.S. blacks for the enslavement of said\nblacks on what is currently considered to be U.S. soil.\n",
