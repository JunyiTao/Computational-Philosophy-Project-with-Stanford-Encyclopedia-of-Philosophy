    "main_text": "Perspectives on connexive logic || Contra-classicality\n3.4 Contra-classicality\n\nHumberstone (2000) calls a logic contra-classical just in\ncase not every formula provable in the logic is provable in classical\nlogic (and, moreover, considers a more demanding notion of a\ncontra-classical logic by requiring that there is no way of\ntranslating its connectives in such a way that one obtains a subsystem\nof classical logic). There are several different kinds of\ncontra-classical logics, such as, for example, Abelian logics\ncontaining the axiom schema ((A \u2192 B) \u2192\nB) \u2192 A, connexive logics, and logics of logical\nbilattices. The negation, truth order conjunction, weak implication,\nand information order disjunction fragment of Arieli and Avron\u2019s\n(1996) bilattice logic BL\u2283, for\nexample, is a standard propositional vocabulary containing a negation,\na conjunction, a disjunction, and a conditional. It is a non-trivial\nbut inconsistent logic and as such contra-classical.\n\nIn Omori and Wansing 2018, a way of obtaining contra-classical logics\nis delineated, and in Estrada-G\u00f3nzalez 2019 it is discussed in\nmore detail. Following the pattern of the presentation of the\nconnexive logic C, cf. section 4.5.1, the general\nidea is that of keeping some standard (support of) truth conditions\nfor a logical operation and modifying its (support of) falsity\nconditions. From a bilateralist perspective that treats truth and\nfalsity as well as provability and disprovability or refutability as\nseparate semantical, respectively proof-theoretical dimensions that\nare on a par, there is also the strategy of keeping some standard\n(support of) falsity conditions for a logical operation and modifying\nits (support of) truth conditions. Connexive logic can be seen as\ncontributing to the exploration of roads to contra-classicality.\n",
