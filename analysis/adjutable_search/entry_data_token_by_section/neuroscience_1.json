    "main_text": "Eliminative Materialism and Philosophy Neuralized\n2. Eliminative Materialism and Philosophy Neuralized\n\nEliminative materialism (EM), in the form advocated most aggressively\nby Paul and Patricia Churchland, is the conjunction of two claims.\nFirst, our common sense \u201cbelief-desire\u201d conception of\nmental events and processes, our \u201cfolk psychology\u201d, is a\nfalse and misleading account of the causes of human behavior. Second,\nlike other false conceptual frameworks from both folk theory and the\nhistory of science, it will be replaced by, rather than smoothly\nreduced or incorporated into, a future neuroscience. The\nChurchlands\u2019 characterized folk psychology as the collection of\ncommon homilies invoked (mostly implicitly) to explain human behavior\ncausally. You ask why Marica is not accompanying me this evening. I\nreply that our grandson needed sitting. You nod sympathetically. You\nunderstand my explanation because you share with me a generalization\nthat relates beliefs about taking care of grandchildren, desires to\nhelp daughters and to spend time with grandchildren compared to\nenjoying a night out, and so on. This is just one of a huge collection\nof homilies about the causes of human behavior that EM claims to be\nflawed beyond potential revision. Although this example involves only\nbeliefs and desires, folk psychology contains an extensive repertoire\nof propositional attitudes in its explanatory nexus: hopes,\nintentions, fears, imaginings, and more. EMists predict that a future,\ngenuinely scientific psychology or neuroscience will eventually eschew\nall of these, and replace them with incommensurable states and\ndynamics of neuro-cognition.\n\nEM is physicalist in one traditional philosophical sense. It\npostulates that some future brain science will be ultimately the\ncorrect account of (human) behavior. It is eliminative in predicting\nthe future rejection of folk psychological kinds from our\npost-neuroscientific ontology. EM proponents often employ scientific\nanalogies (Feyerabend 1963; Paul Churchland, 1981). Oxidative\nreactions as characterized within elemental chemistry bear no\nresemblance to phlogiston release. Even the \u201cdirection\u201d of\nthe two processes differ. Oxygen is gained when an object burns (or\nrusts), phlogiston was said to be lost. The result of this theoretical\nchange was the elimination of phlogiston from our scientific ontology.\nThere is no such thing. For the same reasons, according to EM,\ncontinuing development in neuroscience will reveal that there are no\nsuch things as beliefs, desires, and the rest of the propositional\nattitudes as characterized by common sense.\n\nHere we focus only on the way that neuroscientific results have shaped\nthe arguments for EM. Surprisingly, only one argument has been\nstrongly influenced. (Most arguments for EM stress failures of folk\npsychology as an explanatory theory of behavior.) This argument is\nbased on a development in cognitive and computational neuroscience\nthat might provide a genuine alternative to the representations and\ncomputations implicit in folk psychological generalizations. Many\neliminative materialists assume that folk psychology is committed to\npropositional representations and computations over their contents\nthat mimic logical inferences (Paul Churchland 1981; Stich 1983;\nPatricia Churchland\n 1986).[2]\n Even though discovering an alternative to this view has been an\neliminativist goal for some time, some eliminativists hold that\nneuroscience only began delivering this alternative over the past\nthirty years. Points in and trajectories through vector spaces, as an\ninterpretation of synaptic events and neural activity patterns in\nbiological and artificial neural networks are the key features of this\nalternative. The differences between these notions of cognitive\nrepresentation and transformations, and those of the propositional\nattitudes of folk psychology, provide the basis for one argument for\nEM (Paul Churchland 1987). However, this argument will be opaque to\nthose with no background in cognitive and computational neuroscience,\nso we present a few details. With these details in place, we will\nreturn to this argument for EM (five paragraphs below).\n\nAt one level of analysis, the basic computational element of a neural\nnetwork, biological or artificial, is the nerve cell, or neuron.\nMathematically, neurons can be represented as simple computational\ndevices, transforming inputs into output. Both inputs and outputs\nreflect biological variables. For our discussion, we assume that\nneuronal inputs are frequencies of action potentials (neuronal\n\u201cspikes\u201d) in the axons whose terminal branches synapse\nonto the neuron in question, while neuronal output is the frequency of\naction potentials generated in its axon after processing the inputs. A\nneuron thereby computes its total input, usually treated\nmathematically as the sum of the products of the signal strength along\neach input line times the synaptic weight on that line. It then\ncomputes a new activation state based on its total input and current\nactivation state, and a new output state based on its new activation\nvalue. The neuron\u2019s output state is transmitted as a signal\nstrength to whatever neurons its axon synapses on. The output state\nreflects systematically the neuron\u2019s new activation\n state.[3]\n\nAnalyzed in this fashion, both biological and artificial neural\nnetworks are interpreted naturally as vector-to-vector\ntransformers. The input vector consists of values reflecting\nactivity patterns in axons synapsing on the network\u2019s neurons\nfrom outside (e.g., from sensory transducers or other neural\nnetworks). The output vector consists of values reflecting the\nactivity patterns generated in the network\u2019s neurons that\nproject beyond the net (e.g., to motor effectors or other neural\nnetworks). Given that each neuron\u2019s activity depends partly upon\ntheir total input, and its total input depends partly on synaptic\nweights (e.g., presynaptic neurotransmitter release rate, number and\nefficacy of postsynaptic receptors, availability of enzymes in\nsynaptic cleft), the capacity of biological networks to change their\nsynaptic weights make them plastic vector-to-vector\ntransformers. In principle, a biological network with plastic synapses\ncan come to implement any vector-to-vector transformation that its\ncomposition permits (number of input units, output units, processing\nlayers, recurrency, cross-connections, etc.) (discussed in Paul\nChurchland, 1987, with references to the primary scientific\nliterature).\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe anatomical organization of the cerebellum provides a clear example\nof a network amenable to this computational interpretation. Consider\n Figure 1.\n The cerebellum is the bulbous convoluted structure dorsal to the\nbrainstem. A variety of studies (behavioral, neuropsychological,\nsingle-cell electrophysiological) implicate this structure in motor\nintegration and fine motor coordination. Mossy fibers (axons) from\nneurons outside the cerebellum synapse on cerebellar granule cells,\nwhich in turn project to parallel fibers. Activity patterns across the\ncollection of mossy fibers (frequency of action potentials per time\nunit in each fiber projecting into the cerebellum) provide values for\nthe input vector. Parallel fibers make multiple synapses on the\ndendritic trees and cell bodies of cerebellular Purkinje neurons. Each\nPurkinje neuron \u201csums\u201d its post-synaptic potentials (PSPs)\nand emits a train of action potentials down its axon based (partly) on\nits total input and previous activation state. Purkinje axons project\noutside the cerebellum. The network\u2019s output vector is thus the\nordered values representing the pattern of activity generated in each\nPurkinje axon. Changes to the efficacy of individual synapses on the\nparallel fibers and the Purkinje neurons alter the resulting PSPs in\nPurkinje axons, generating different axonal spiking frequencies.\nComputationally, this amounts to a different output vector to the same\ninput activity\n pattern\u2014plasticity.[4]\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nThis interpretation puts the useful mathematical resources of\ndynamical systems into the hands of computational\nneuroscientists. Vector spaces are an example. Learning can\nthen be characterized fruitfully in terms of changes in synaptic\nweights in the network and subsequent reduction of error in network\noutput. (This approach to learning goes back to Hebb 1949, although\nthe vector-space interpretation was not part of Hebb\u2019s account.)\nA useful representation of this account uses a synaptic\nweight-error space. One dimension represents the global error in\nthe network\u2019s output to a given task, and all other dimensions\nrepresent the weight values of individual synapses in the network.\nConsider\n Figure 2.\n Points in this multi-dimensional state space represent the global\nperformance error correlated with each possible collection of synaptic\nweights in the network. As the weights change with each performance,\nin accordance with a biologically-inspired learning algorithm, the\nglobal error of network performance continually decreases. The\nchanging synaptic weights across the network with each training\nepisode reduces the total error of the network\u2019s output vector,\ncompared to the desired output vector for the input vector. Learning\nis represented as synaptic weight changes correlated with a descent\nalong the error dimension in the space (Churchland and Sejnowski\n1992). Representations (concepts) can be portrayed as\npartitions in multi-dimensional vector spaces. One example is\na neuron activation vector space. See\n Figure 3.\n A graph of such a space contains one dimension for the activation\nvalue of each neuron in the network (or some specific subset of the\nnetwork\u2019s neurons, such as those in a specific layer). A point\nin this space represents one possible pattern of activity in all\nneurons in the network. Activity patterns generated by input vectors\nthat the network has learned to group together will cluster around a\n(hyper-) point or subvolume in the activity vector space. Any input\npattern sufficiently similar to this group will produce an activity\npattern lying in geometrical proximity to this point or subvolume.\nPaul Churchland (1989) argued that this interpretation of network\nactivity provided a quantitative, neurally-inspired basis for\nprototype theories of concepts developed in late-twentieth century\ncognitive psychology.\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\nUsing this theoretical development, and in the realm of\nneurophilosophy, Paul Churchland (1987, 1989) offered a novel,\nneuroscientifically-inspired argument for EM. According to the\ninterpretation of neural networks just sketched, activity vectors are\nthe central kind of representations, and vector-to-vector\ntransformations are the central kind of computations, in the brain.\nThis contrasts sharply with the propositional representations\nand logical/semantic computations postulated by folk\npsychology. Vectorial content, an ordered sequence of real numbers, is\nunfamiliar and alien to common sense. This cross-theoretic conceptual\ndifference is at least as great as that between oxidative and\nphlogiston concepts, or kinetic-corpuscular and caloric fluid heat\nconcepts. Phlogiston and caloric fluid are two \u201cparade\u201d\nexamples of kinds eliminated from our scientific ontology due to the\nnature of the intertheoretic relation obtaining between the theories\nwith which they are affiliated and the theories that replaced them.\nThe structural and dynamic differences between the folk psychological\nand then-emerging cognitive neuroscientific kinds suggested that the\ntheories affiliated with the latter will likewise replace the theory\naffiliated with the former. But this claim was the key premise of the\neliminativist argument based on predicted intertheoretic relations.\nAnd with the rise of neural networks and parallel distributed\nprocessing, intertheoretic contrasts with folk-psychological\nexplanatory kinds were no longer just an eliminativist\u2019s future\nhope. Computational and cognitive neuroscience was delivering an\nalternative kinematics for cognition, one that provided no structural\nanalogue for folk psychology\u2019s propositional attitudes or\nlogic-like computations over propositional contents.\n\nCertainly the vector-space alternatives of this interpretation of\nneural networks are alien to folk psychology. But do they justify EM?\nEven if the propositional contents of folk-psychological posits find\nno analogues in one theoretical development in cognitive and\ncomputational neuroscience (that was hot three decades ago), there\nmight be other aspects of cognition that folk psychology gets right.\nWithin the scientific realism that informed early neurophilosophy,\nconcluding that a cross-theoretic identity claim is true (e.g., folk\npsychological state F is identical to neural state N) or that an\neliminativist claim is true (there is no such thing as folk\npsychological state F) depended on the nature of the intertheoretic\nreduction obtaining between the theories affiliated with the posits in\nquestion (Hooker 1981a,b,c; Churchland 1986; Bickle, 1998). But the\nunderlying account of intertheoretic reduction also recognized a\nspectrum of possible reductions, ranging from relatively\n\u201csmooth\u201d through \u201csignificantly revisionary\u201d\nto \u201cextremely\n bumpy\u201d.[5]\n Might the reduction of folk psychology to a \u201cvectorial\u201d\ncomputational neuroscience occupy some middle ground between\n\u201csmooth\u201d and \u201cbumpy\u201d intertheoretic reduction\nendpoints, and hence suggest a \u201crevisionary\u201d conclusion?\nThe reduction of classical equilibrium thermodynamics-to-statistical\nmechanics provided a potential analogy here. John Bickle (1992, 1998,\nchapter 6) argued on empirical grounds that such an outcome is likely.\nHe specified conditions on \u201crevisionary\u201d reductions from\nhistorical examples and suggested that these conditions are obtaining\nbetween folk psychology and cognitive neuroscience as the latter\ndevelops. In particular, folk psychology appears to have gotten right\nthe grossly-specified functional profile of many cognitive states,\nespecially those closely related to sensory inputs and behavioral\noutputs. It also appears to get right the \u201cintentionality\u201d\nof many cognitive states\u2014the object that the state is of or\nabout\u2014even though cognitive neuroscience eschews its implicit\nlinguistic explanation of this feature. Revisionary physicalism\npredicts significant conceptual change to folk psychological\nconcepts, but denies total elimination of the caloric fluid-phlogiston\nvariety.\n\nThe philosophy of science is another area where vector space\ninterpretations of neural network activity patterns has impacted\nphilosophy. In the Introduction to his (1989) book, A\nNeurocomputational Perspective, Paul Churchland asserted,\ndistinctively neurophilosophically, that it will soon be impossible to\ndo serious work in the philosophy of science without drawing on\nempirical work in the brain and behavioral sciences. To justify this\nclaim, in Part II of the book he suggested neurocomputational\nreformulations of key concepts from the philosophy of science. At the\nheart of his reformulations is a neurocomputational account of the\nstructure of scientific theories (1989: chapter 9). Problems with the\northodox \u201csets-of-sentences\u201d view of scientific theories\nhave been well-known since the 1960s. Churchland advocated replacing\nthe orthodox view with one inspired by the \u201cvectorial\u201d\ninterpretation of neural network activity. Representations implemented\nin neural networks (as sketched above) compose a system that\ncorresponds to important distinctions in the external environment, are\nnot explicitly represented as such within the input corpus, and allow\nthe trained network to respond to inputs in a fashion that continually\nreduces error. According to Churchland, these are functions of\ntheories. Churchland was bold in his assertion: an individual\u2019s\ntheory-of-the-world is a specific point in that individual\u2019s\nerror-synaptic weight vector space. It is a configuration of synaptic\nweights that partitions the individual\u2019s activation vector space\ninto subdivisions that reduce future error messages to both familiar\nand novel inputs. (Consider again\n Figure 2\n and\n Figure 3.)\n This reformulation invites an objection, however. Churchland boasts\nthat his theory of theories is preferable to existing alternatives to\nthe orthodox \u201csets-of-sentences\u201d account\u2014for\nexample, the semantic view (Suppe 1974; van Fraassen\n1980)\u2014because his is closer to the \u201cbuzzing brains\u201d\nthat use theories. But as Bickle (1993) noted, neurocomputational models based on the\nmathematical resources described above are a long way into the realm\nof mathematical abstraction. They are little more than novel (albeit\nsuggestive) application of the mathematics of quasi-linear dynamical\nsystems to simplified schemata of brain circuitries. Neurophilosophers\nowe some account of identifications across ontological categories\n(vector representations and transformation to what?) before the\nphilosophy of science community will treat theories as points in\nhigh-dimensional state spaces implemented in biological neural\nnetworks. (There is an important methodological assumption lurking in\nBickle\u2019s objection, however, which we will discuss toward the\nend of the next paragraph.)\n\nChurchland\u2019s neurocomputational reformulations of other\nscientific and epistemological concepts build on this account of\ntheories. He sketches \u201cneuralized\u201d accounts of the\ntheory-ladenness of perception, the nature of concept unification, the\nvirtues of theoretical simplicity, the nature of Kuhnian paradigms,\nthe kinematics of conceptual change, the character of abduction, the\nnature of explanation, and even moral knowledge and epistemological\nnormativity. Conceptual redeployment, for example, is the activation\nof an already-existing prototype representation\u2014the centerpoint\nor region of a partition of a high-dimensional vector space in a\ntrained neural network\u2014by a novel type of input pattern.\nObviously, we can\u2019t here do justice to Churchland\u2019s many\nand varied attempts at reformulation. We urge the intrigued reader to\nexamine his suggestions in their original form. But a word about\nphilosophical methodology is in order. Churchland is not\nattempting \u201cconceptual analysis\u201d in anything resembling\nits traditional philosophical sense. Neither, typically, are\nneurophilosophers in any of their reformulation projects. (This is why\na discussion of neurophilosophical reformulations fits with a\ndiscussion of EM.) There are philosophers who take the\ndiscipline\u2019s ideal analyses to be a relatively simple set of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions, expressed in non-technical\nnatural language, governing the application of important concepts\n(like justice, knowledge, theory, or explanation). These analyses\nshould square, to the extent possible, with pretheoretical usage.\nIdeally, they should preserve synonymy. Other philosophers view this\nideal as sterile, misguided, and perhaps deeply mistaken about the\nunderlying structure of human knowledge (Ramsey 1992).\nNeurophilosophers tend to reside in the latter group. Those who\ndislike philosophical speculation about the promise and potential of\ndeveloping science to reformulate\n(\u201creform-ulate\u201d) traditional philosophical\nconcepts have probably already discovered that neurophilosophy is not\nfor them. But the familiar charge that neurocomputational\nreformulations of the sort Churchland attempts are\n\u201cphilosophically uninteresting\u201d or\n\u201cirrelevant\u201d because they fail to provide\n\u201canalyses\u201d of theory, explanation, and the like will fall\non deaf ears among many contemporary \u201cnaturalistic\u201d\nphilosophers, who have by and large given up on traditional\nphilosophical \u201canalysis\u201d.\n\nBefore we leave the topic of proposed neurophilosophical applications\nof this theoretical development from \u201cneural\nnetworks\u201d-style cognitive/computational neuroscience, one final\npoint of actual scientific detail bears mention. This approach did not\nremain state-of-the-art computational neuroscience for long.\nMany neural modelers quickly gave up this approach to\nmodeling the brain. Compartmental modeling enabled\ncomputational neuroscientists to mimic activity in and\ninteractions between patches of neuronal membrane (Bower and Beeman\n1995). This approach permitted modelers to control and manipulate a\nvariety of subcellular factors that determine action potentials per\ntime unit, including the topology of membrane structure in individual\nneurons, variations in ion channels across membrane patches, and field\nproperties of post-synaptic potentials depending on the location of\nthe synapse on the dendrite or soma. By the mid-1990s modelers quickly\nbegan to \u201ccustom build\u201d the neurons in their target\ncircuitry. Increasingly powerful computer hardware still allowed them\nto study circuit properties of modeled networks. For these reasons,\nmany serious computational neuroscientists switched to working at a\nlevel of analysis that treats neurons as structured rather than simple\ncomputational devices. With compartmental modeling, vector-to-vector\ntransformations came to be far less useful in serious neurobiological\nmodels, replaced by differential equations representing ion currents\nacross patches of neural membrane. Far more biological detail came to\nbe captured in the resulting models than \u201cconnectionist\u201d\nmodels permitted. This methodological change across computational\nneuroscience meant that a neurophilosophy guided by\n\u201cconnectionist\u201d resources no longer drew from the state of\nthe art of the scientific field.\n\nPhilosophy of science and scientific epistemology were not the only\nareas where neurophilosophers urged the relevance of neuroscientific\ndiscoveries for traditionally philosophical topics. A decade after\nNeurophilosophy\u2019s publication, Kathleen Akins (1996)\nargued that a \u201ctraditional\u201d view of the senses underlies a\nvariety of sophisticated \u201cnaturalistic\u201d programs about\nintentionality. (She cites the Churchlands, Daniel Dennett, Fred\nDretske, Jerry Fodor, David Papineau, Dennis Stampe, and Kim Sterelny\nas examples.) But then-recent neuroscientific work on the mechanisms\nand coding strategies implemented by sensory receptors shows that this\ntraditional view is mistaken. The traditional view holds that sensory\nsystems are \u201cveridical\u201d in at least three ways. (1) Each\nsignal in the system correlates with a small range of properties in\nthe external (to the body) environment. (2) The structure in the\nrelevant external relations that the receptors are sensitive to is\npreserved in the structure of the internal relations among the\nresulting sensory states. And (3) the sensory system reconstructs\nfaithfully, without fictive additions or embellishments, the external\nevents. Using then-recent neurobiological discoveries about response\nproperties of thermal receptors in the skin (i.e.,\n\u201cthermoreceptors\u201d) as an illustration, Akins showed that\nsensory systems are \u201cnarcissistic\u201d rather than\n\u201cveridical\u201d. All three traditional assumptions are\nviolated. These neurobiological details and their philosophical\nimplications open novel questions for the philosophy of perception and\nfor the appropriate foundations for naturalistic projects about\nintentionality. Armed with the known neurophysiology of sensory\nreceptors, our \u201cphilosophy of perception\u201d or account of\n\u201cperceptual intentionality\u201d will no longer focus on the\nsearch for correlations between states of sensory systems and\n\u201cveridically detected\u201d external properties. This\ntraditional philosophical (and scientific!) project rests upon a\nmistaken \u201cveridicality\u201d view of the senses.\nNeuroscientific knowledge of sensory receptor activity also shows that\nsensory experience does not serve the naturalist well as a\n\u201csimple paradigm case\u201d of an intentional relation between\nrepresentation and world. Once again, available scientific detail\nshowed the naivety of some traditional philosophical projects.\n\nFocusing on the anatomy and physiology of the pain transmission\nsystem, Valerie Hardcastle (1997) urged a similar negative implication\nfor a popular methodological assumption. Pain experiences have long\nbeen philosophers\u2019 favorite cases for analysis and theorizing\nabout conscious experiences generally. Nevertheless, every position\nabout pain experiences has been defended: eliminativism, a variety of\nobjectivist views, relational views, and subjectivist views. Why so\nlittle agreement, despite agreement that pain experiences are the\nplace to start an analysis or theory of consciousness? Hardcastle\nurged two answers. First, philosophers tend to be uninformed about the\nneuronal complexity of our pain transmission systems, and build their\nanalyses or theories on the outcome of a single component of a\nmulti-component system. Second, even those who understand some of the\nunderlying neurobiology of pain tend to advocate gate-control\n theories.[6]\n But the best existing gate-control theories are vague about the\nneural mechanisms of the gates. Hardcastle instead proposed a\ndissociable dual system of pain transmission, consisting of a pain\nsensory system closely analogous in its neurobiological implementation\nto other sensory systems, and a descending pain inhibitory system. She\nargued that this dual system is consistent with neuroscientific\ndiscoveries and accounts for all the pain phenomena that have tempted\nphilosophers toward particular (but limited) theories of pain\nexperience. The neurobiological uniqueness of the pain inhibitory\nsystem, contrasted with the mechanisms of other sensory modalities,\nrenders pain processing atypical. In particular, the pain inhibitory\nsystem dissociates pain sensation from stimulation of nociceptors\n(pain receptors). Hardcastle concluded from the neurobiological\nuniqueness of pain transmission that pain experiences are atypical\nconscious events, and hence not a good place to start theorizing about\nor analyzing the general type.\n",
