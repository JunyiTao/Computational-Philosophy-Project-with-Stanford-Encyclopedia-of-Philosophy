For example, until the\n1950s many instances of behavioral variation were thought to be\nattributable to genetic differences between human groups (Barkan\n1992). Research in the life sciences over the last 70 years, however,\nfailed to produce evidence to support such explanations, finding\ninstead that biological differences between human populations are\nminor and superficial (Hirschman 2004). The loss of confidence in\npurely genetic explanations inspired researchers to continue exploring\nalternatives.\n\nAlternatively, many social sciences deal in\n\u201cstructuralist\u201d explanations that account for behavior by\nappeal to factors exogenous to individuals, such as norms, laws,\ninstitutions, economic policies, and government types. These would\nexplain patterns of intergroup variation in behavior by appeal to\ndifferences between the structures that organize each group. Since\nstructural factors of this sort are passed along socially rather than\ngenetically, however, they fall comfortably under the broad working\ndefinition of \u2018culture\u2019 provided above, and so can be\ncounted as a genre of cultural explanation (Haslanger 2016; Davidson\n& Kelly 2020; Soon 2021).\n\nMost of the alternative explanations that are not cultural in\nthe sense at issue here\u2014and so which do not give a\ncentral role to social transmission\u2014attempt to explain\nintergroup variation by stressing the importance of differences in the\nexternal physical or ecological environments inhabited by different\ngroups, or by appeal to the operation of psychological mechanisms like\ncausal reasoning or individual trial-and-error learning (Richerson\n& Boyd 2005). The range of options can be elucidated by examining\nevolutionary approaches to human behavior, and comparing the distinct\nway each approach appeals to such factors in their proprietary modes\nof explanation (E. Smith 2000). For example, human behavioral ecology\nremains largely agnostic, or at least assigns little significance to,\nthe character of the internal psychological mechanisms that might lead\nto group level behavioral diversity. Instead, behavioral ecologists\nappear to simply assume (perhaps unrealistically, see Driscoll 2009)\nthat humans are able to produce behavior that optimizes fitness across\na wide range of environments, and by implication also assume that\nindividual human minds are generally flexible enough to calibrate\nbehavioral strategies to best fit whatever ecological circumstances\nthey find themselves in (Grafen 1984). On this view, patterns of\nbehavior within a group typically reflect commonalities in the\necological circumstances faced by most members of the group, and\ndifferences in the patterns found between groups reflect, fairly\ndirectly, differences in the ecological circumstances those groups\ninhabit. Such explanations make little mention of mental structure and\nno mention of culture or cultural inheritance.\n\nBy contrast, practitioners of the research program that has become\nknown as Evolutionary Psychology are much more concerned with mental\nstructure and evolved psychological mechanisms, and readily discuss\nsome forms of cultural variation (Barkow, Cosmides, & Tooby 1992;\nalso see Hagen 2015). Evolutionary Psychologist\u2019s approach to\nexplaining human behavioral variation builds on the more general\nnotion of phenotypic plasticity. The approach emphasizes that\nphenotypic plasticity (of the behavioral phenotype, but also of\nmorphological, physiological, and other dimensions of phenotypic\nexpression) is found not just in humans, but in almost all organisms.\nMechanisms that underlie such plasticity allow individuals with\nsimilar genotypes to express different phenotypes, and thus to\nflexibly adapt to different environments in a variety of ways. For\ninstance, researchers have appealed to this kind of interaction\nbetween environmental differences, on the one hand, and mechanisms\nunderlying phenotypic plasticity, on the other, to explain systematic\npatterns of variation in the clutch sizes of members of the same\nspecies of bird found in different geographical regions (Tooby &\nCosmides 1992). Evolutionary Psychologists offer explanations with a\nsimilar form for many instances of human variation, such as regional\ndifferences in the distribution of values. One such account holds that\nthe prevalence in some groups of certain kinds of values and\nnorms\u2014collectivist or exclusivist\u2014can be explained as an\nadaptive response evoked by the salience of cues indicating high\npathogen threat in the group\u2019s environment. Alternatively, the\nprevalence in other groups of contrasting values and\nnorms\u2014individualistic or inclusivist\u2014are explained by the\nabsence of such cues, and thus an environment that allows the\nexpression of a different adaptive phenotype (Schaller & Park\n2011; also see Buchanan & Powell 2016; cf. Gelfand et al. 2011;\nHouse et al. 2020).\n\nWith respect to the psychological sources of human behavioral\nplasticity and cultural diversity, Evolutionary Psychologists tend to\nconstrue human minds as \u201cmassively modular\u201d (though the\nconception of a \u201cmodule\u201d involved in this kind of claim is\ntypically more liberal than the one made famous by Fodor 1983; see\nSamuels 1998, 2000; Sperber 2001; Barrett & Kurzban 2006;\nCarruthers 2006; Robbins 2009 [2017]). Human minds share a number of\ndistinct, genetically inherited dispositions, each shaped by the\nselective pressures generated by the adaptive problem it evolved to\nhandle. Each disposition can produce a circumscribed range of\nbehaviors to deal with its associated adaptive challenge, but not all\nthe behaviors made possible by those dispositions are manifested by\nevery human or every group. Rather, patterns of behavior are shaped\nand constrained by the character of mental modules, but are also\nexplained in part by appeal to external circumstances, with different\nenvironments acting to select or evoke different subsets of\nbehaviors from the range already \u201ccontained in\u201d and made\navailable by these universally shared psychological dispositions\n(compare Plato Meno). Proponents point out that on this view,\nevoked behaviors can persist even as the environment that originally\nevoked them changes or disappears. For example, once a behavioral\nphenotype is initially expressed it can be effectively locked in by a\nprocess of developmental canalization (D. Wilson 2009; Witherington\n& Lickliter 2016). Proponents also stress that the view does not\nimply that all behaviors and differences between groups are adaptive.\nFor example, the claim that the comparatively higher incidence of teen\npregnancies in lower income groups is an adaptive response evoked by\nconditions of poverty remains a matter of controversy and empirical\ninvestigation (Johns, Dickins, & Clegg 2011).\n\nThese \u201cevoked culture\u201d explanations associated with\nEvolutionary Psychology are often contrasted with the\n\u201ctransmitted culture\u201d explanations associated with dual\ninheritance theory (Norenzayan 2006). While both are designed to\naccount for patterns of behavioral variation between groups, the\nformer do not involve the kind of information conveyed between\nindividuals central to the explication given in\n Section 1.2.\n For this reason, the psychological modules from which behaviors are\nevoked in the explanations given by Evolutionary Psychologists have\nbeen classified by other theorists as \u201cnon-cultural\nmechanisms\u201d (Mathew & Perreault 2015). Alternatively,\ntransmitted culture explanations point to a different source of\nphenotypic plasticity, namely cultural inheritance and the\npsychological mechanisms that underpin social transmission. A third\napproach can be seen as combining elements of both of these (Sperber\n1996; Morin 2011 [2016]). Advocates of cultural epidemiology, which is\noften presented as being distinct from both dual inheritance theory\nand Evolutionary Psychology, typically attempt to explain instances of\ncultural diversity and stability in terms of how different evolved,\ndomain-specific modules influence the acquisition, transmission,\nreconstruction, and retention of specific mental representations.\n\nThese three forms of explanation are distinct in many ways, but are\nnot necessarily in competition with each other (Sterelny 2017). In\nmany cases advocates of the different approaches are concerned with\ndifferent kinds of behavior: few Evolutionary Psychologists have\nattempted to account for the accumulation of material technology or\nscientific knowledge. Dual inheritance theorists tend to focus on\nforms of cooperation, social organization, and culturally complex\nadaptions while eschewing topics like sexual behavior, mate\npreferences, and phobias (although there are exceptions; see Dugatkin\n1996; Faucher & Blanchette 2011; Adriaens & De Block 2006).\nNeither pay as much attention to the character and dynamics of\nnon-adaptive traditions centered on, e.g., recipes, songs, or folk\ntales as cultural epidemiologists typically do (Acerbi, Kendal, &\nTehrani 2017). Advocates of the three types of explanation typically\naccept that each is able to account for some instances of behavioral\nvariation but not others. Moreover, the boundaries between these\napproaches are vague and overlapping at best, and much good work on\nevolution and culture combines ideas from more than one. Nevertheless,\nadvocates of different approaches occasionally disagree about the best\nway to conceptualize culture (Sperber & Claidi\u00e8re 2008),\nabout the relative importance of social learning and transmitted\nculture in general (Richerson & Boyd 2008), about whether and how\nculture should enter into ultimate explanations of behavior\n(Scott-Phillips, Dickins, & West 2011), and about the best\nexplanation of specific cases, such as different features of prosocial\nreligions (Bulbulia 2004; Norenzayan et al. 2016) and morality\n(Sripada & Stich 2007; Buchanan & Powell 2018; Brownstein\n& Kelly 2019).\n\nPhilosophers have joined these debates. Many have challenged\nEvolutionary Psychology\u2019s evoked culture explanations by\nattempting to show that alternative explanations better capture\nvarious target phenomena, or by arguing that the kinds of behaviors\nthat Evolutionary Psychologists focus on lead them to underestimate\nthe variation exhibited by our species and the plasticity required to\naccount for it (Dupr\u00e9 2001; Buller 2005; Richardson 2007;\nDownes 2015). By contrast, philosophers have tended to think more\n\u2018with the science\u2019 of cultural epidemiology (Nichols 2002;\nDe Cruz & De Smedt 2015) and dual inheritance theory (Skyrms 2010;\nSterelny 2012; Davis & Kelly 2018). Philosophical advocates of\nthese approaches see them as more promising in virtue of the\nconceptual and methodological sophistication they find in them,\ntogether with the models they have developed to clarify the kinds of\ninteractions that might hold between genes, transmitted culture, and\ncognition (R. Boyd & Richerson 2005; Gualaderex 2012; also see\nPaul 2015). As a result, philosophical discussions of cultural\nepidemiology and dual inheritance theory are often less\nstraightforwardly critical. Instead, many aim at drawing out\ninteresting philosophical implications (Boudry, Blancke, &\nPigliucci 2015; Kelly & Hoburg 2017), shoring up conceptual\nfoundations by offering refinements and amendments (Lewens 2015;\nBuskell 2019); or emphasizing the need for more elaborated methods to\nempirically test their hypotheses (Sterelny 2020).\n",
