The Influence of Spanish Liberalism\n\nIn response to the French invasion in 1808, Spanish liberalism\ndeveloped as an ideology of liberation against a foreign invader. This\nwas the first powerful liberal movement in the Spanish empire and the\nvery first serious questioning of absolute rule. In a society that had\nalmost no experience in political representation, liberals sought to\nend despotic rule by replacing it with a parliamentary monarchy. They\ndenied sovereign authority to the King and declared it to lie in the\nnation, which, in turn, was conceived of as having the faculty to make\nand remake its own fundamental laws. Traditionally, representation in\nthe Courts had been corporate (nobility, clergy and the\nmunicipalities), while liberals stood for individualistic\nrepresentation. Against despotism, liberals also favored a division of\npowers and an independent judiciary. Spanish liberalism was a\nrevolutionary ideology that marked a radical break with the\nmonarchical status quo. Liberals sought to end a corporate society and\nto create an individualistic one by abolishing corporate privileges\nand immunities and by replacing them with legal equality and economic\nfreedom. The liberal position was expressed in the\nC\u00e1diz constitution of 1812.\n\nThe most important philosophical influence that shaped the liberal\nposition was the political ideas of the French Revolution and, more\nspecifically, the 1791 Constitution (Varela Suanzes 1995). The\nC\u00e1diz constitution exhibited the influence of\nEnlightenment rationalism, the rationalist natural rights discourse,\nand the political ideas of Montesquieu and Rousseau, to name the most\nsalient referred to authors (Varela Suanzes1987). The liberal deputies\nembraced the idea of individual rights that were natural and\ninalienable. They also affirmed the natural equality of all men and\nthe doctrine of national sovereignty. Following the French model, the\nC\u00e1diz constitution established a division of powers that\nprivileged the legislative as the power that represented the nation.\nThe constitution established a unicameral legislature in which there\nwere no special provisions for the traditional preeminence of the\nclergy and the nobility. While the monarch, as the executive, was\nsubordinate to the legislative, the judiciary was held to be\nindependent, echoing Locke and Montesquieu (Varela Suanzes1983).\n\nHowever, there are two crucial features that notably distinguish the\nC\u00e1diz constitution from the French model. The former, by\ncontrast with the latter, was grounded in an appeal to history and it\nexhibited the weight of Catholicism. As regards the first feature, the\nC\u00e1diz constitution presented itself in its preamble as in\ncontinuity with fundamental old Spanish legislation that had allegedly\nbeen subverted by despotism. According to the traditional view, the\nauthority of the monarch rested on a pact with its people from which\npact followed the fundamental laws of the monarchy that the king had\nto observe. The liberal appeal to historical legitimacy was clearly at\nodds with the doctrine of national sovereignty according to which\nsovereign authority is unlimited\u2014the ultimate source of\nauthority. In fact, liberals introduced a conventional conception of\npolitical power that subverted the traditional scholastic one\naccording to which political power was natural and historical.\nNevertheless, the presentation of the Constitution as in continuity\nwith fundamental legislation tempered the break with the past (Varela\nSuanzes1987).\n\nAs regards the second feature, the C\u00e1diz constitution continued\nthe imperial protection of the Catholic religion to the exclusion of\nall others despite the fact that it also ended some privileges and\nimmunities that the Catholic Church had traditionally enjoyed. It has\nbeen argued, however, that religious intolerance was not a feature of\nSpanish liberalism, but a concession that liberals had to make to\ntraditionalist political forces in the C\u00e1diz Courts (Varela\nSuanzes1987). Nevertheless, the religious language that pervades the\nconstitutional text reveals the influence of Spanish scholasticism\naccording to which there are exterior limits to sovereignty (natural,\ndivine, historical, and teleological). This influence was even\nstronger in Spanish America since the intellectual elite around the\ntime of independence had been educated in Spanish scholasticism.\nReligious toleration was a matter of bitter disputes even among Latin\nAmerican liberals themselves and the religious language continued to\nbe present in legal documents throughout the nineteenth century.\n\nEarly Latin American liberalism must be seen through the influence of\nthe Spanish liberalism that developed in this political context,\nalthough the former\u2019s two strands developed in different\ndirections. While the Hispanic American strand (i.e., the strand in\nSpanish-speaking America) was firmly committed to a radical break with\nthe colonial past, the Brazilian one was marked by crucial points of\ncontinuity. Let us consider the Hispanic strand first. The mark of the\nC\u00e1diz constitution was evident in most Hispanic American\nconstitutions in the first half of the century (Safford 1987: 62). All\nof them claimed sovereign authority to lie in the people or the nation\nand protected some basic individual rights (such as freedom of thought\nand of the press) that were considered natural. They all maintained\nprotection of the Catholic religion as the official one as well as\nmost of the corporate privileges of the Catholic Church. They also\nestablished a separation of powers and departed from the Spanish model\nby creating bicameral systems. However, there are at least two\nimportant points of contrast between Spanish and Hispanic American\nliberals. The first one is that Hispanic American liberals could not\nbuttress their constitutionalism with appeals to historical\nlegitimacy. They could not present the constitutions that they\nproduced in continuity with the fundamental medieval laws of the\nSpanish monarchy. Independence from Spain pushed, after three\ncenturies of colonialism, to conceive of the liberal institutions as\nsomething completely new that lacked any historical precedent. By\ncontrast with Spanish liberals who looked both to the future and to\nthe past, the Hispanic American ones made a break with the past and\nlooked to the future only where emancipation and progress were\nsupposed to lie. Liberal constitutions held the promise of a society\nfully transformed away from the colonial structures and in accordance\nwith the protection of individual freedoms and legal equality. When\nHispanic American liberalism became the ideology of a political group\nin the mid-century, its identity was importantly centered in this\nforward looking attitude. Liberal political actors often referred to\nthemselves as \u201cthe party of progress.\u201d\n\nThe second point of contrast is that Hispanic American liberalism was\nmore radically egalitarian. Hispanic American liberals rejected a\nmonarchical option and very early abolished slavery and noble titles.\nBy mid-century slavery had been formally abolished in all independent\ncountries. Hispanic American liberalism became synonymous with\nrepublican government, which meant a commitment to legal equality,\npolitical representation, and the rejection of monarchism. After three\ncenturies of despotic monarchical rule, Hispanic Americans associated\nmonarchism with despotism. They feared that one-person rule, even when\nlimited by a parliament, would inevitably become despotic\u2014as it\nin fact happened in the short lived monarchy in Mexico right after\nindependence. This egalitarianism, however, did not translate into the\nestablishment of a rule of law that guaranteed equal legal treatment\nto all citizens. Nor did the egalitarian discourse translate into the\ndemocratic inclusion of all citizens in the exercise of political\nrights. Most Hispanic American liberals firmly believed in the need of\nproperty or literacy qualifications for voting and for running for\npublic office. They were consistently skeptical about extending\npolitical rights to a population that they regarded as incapable for\nrepublican citizenship.\n\nWhile early Hispanic American liberalism defined itself by its\nrejection of the colonial heritage, Brazilian liberalism, by contrast,\nacquired its identity in the confrontation with the advocates of\nmonarchical absolutism. Brazilian liberals did not challenge\nmonarchism. Instead, they sought to establish parliamentary limits to\nmonarchical authority (Cyril 2012), thus favoring a representative\nmonarchy. Though absolutists and liberals agreed on the need for a\nwritten constitution, the protection of some fundamental liberties\n(such as freedom of the press), and a legislative body that\nrepresented the nation, the differences between them turned on the\nextent and limits of the executive authority. Liberals sought to\nsubordinate the king to the legislative authority, while absolutists\npushed for the opposite balance of forces. Brazilian liberalism became\nstrongly identified with economic freedom, whereas absolutists favored\ngovernmental intervention in the economy along the lines of the late\neighteenth century reformist absolutism. While Brazilian liberals\nwished to emulate North American federalism, absolutists were firmly\ncommitted to political centralism and, hence, to the political control\nof the entire nation by the monarch. In the second half of the\ncentury, Brazilian liberals defined themselves by opposition to\n\u201cconservatives\u201d who favored political centralization, the\nperpetuation of oligarchical privilege, and resisted the emancipation\nof slaves, among other issues. However, it has been maintained that\nthe differences between the two political groups \u201cwere\nessentially rethorical\u201d (Viotti da Costa 1986).\n",
