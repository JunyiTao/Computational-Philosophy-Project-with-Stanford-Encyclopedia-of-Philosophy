    "main_text": "Philo and Philosophical Schools || From Scepticism to Pythagorean Platonism\n3.3 From Scepticism to Pythagorean Platonism\n\nBr\u00e9hier, a great French name in Philonian studies, wrote that\nPhilo\u2019s thoughts aligned much closer to Platonism than to\nSkepticism (Br\u00e9hier 1908 [1925: 214]). That assertion is\ncharacteristic of an epoch in which these two doctrines were\nconsidered to be radically different. More recent studies have\ndemonstrated that things are much more complex. Middle Platonist\nphilosophers like Plutarch, Favorinus, or Alcinoos integrated many\nelements of Skepticism to their dogmas (Bonazzi 2007), especially in\norder to undermine Hellenistic naturalism and redirect attention to an\nidea of transcendence. Philo himself knew the existence of two kinds\nof Skepticism: New Academic and Neopyrrhonian (L\u00e9vy 2008). The\nformer school seems to have disappeared as a structured institution by\nhis lifetime. The latter came to prominence in the middle of the first\ncentury BCE, with Enesidemus criticizing New Academic philosophers,\nand especially those of his age, on the grounds that they had conceded\nfar too much to Stoic dogma. Philo seems to have paid little attention\nto New Academic sceptics, but was acquainted at least with some of\ntheir principal doctrines. By contrast, he is the first to have used\nthe tropes, i.e., the system of Sceptic arguments, elaborated by\nEnesidemus, which remained for centuries a kind of manifesto of\nSkepticism. At the beginning of the twentieth century and for many\nyears after, scholars paid great attention to the passage of the\nDe ebrietate where Philo uses these tropes. Today, however,\nit is commonplace to say that the connection was a weak one, and that\nPhilo had his own interests instead. Of course he did, but Sextus\nEmpircus himself, now considered the most reliable source, had his own\ninterests as well as being a physician, and it is rash at least to\nneglect the Philonian testimony, closer to Enesidemus from both a\ngeographical and chronological point of view. Philo uses Sceptic\nmethods to demonstrate that even with the aid of education, the\npaideia of which he was so proud, human beings are unable to\nfind the truth. Skepticism thus appears as the best means to awaken\nmankind to its oudeneia and to open the path toward\ntranscendence.\n\n\u201cWas Philo a Middle Platonist?\u201d is the title David Runia\ngave to one of his articles (1993). There is at least one point of\nconsensus among the scholars, i.e., that Philo\u2019s Platonism\naccurately reflected the Platonist interpretations circulating in\nAlexandria at the time. Very useful comparisons have been made with\nEudorus, a contemporary and compatriot, and with Plutarch. It is most\nprobable that Pythagoreanism played a great role in Philo\u2019s\ndevelopment of negative theology; it certainly did so in his doctrine\nof the first principle. At the same time, Philo makes extensive use of\nPlato as well despite the difficulty of reconciling this doctrine with\nmore classical Platonic themes. The presence of the Timaeus\nin the De opificio mundi is massive, as demonstrated by Runia\n(2001). Philo\u2019s many allusions to the theme of\n\u201cassimilation to God\u201d prove how conscious he was of the\ndifference between Stoic immanence and Platonic transcendence. At the\ncore of Stoic ethics lay the concept of oikei\u00f4sis,\nwhich required both adaptation to Nature and absolute obedience to her\nguidance. The word oikei\u00f4sis derives from\noikos, meaning house. The goal of a Stoic\u2019s life was to\nknow every hidden recess of \u201cNature\u2019s house\u201d and to\ndwell respectfully therein. On the contrary, for Middle Platonists who\nwere readers and commentators of the Theaetetus, the goal was\nto depart from nature, a dwelling of sensations and injustice, in\norder to become as similar as possible to God. Another major theme\nthat Philo shares with other Middle Platonists is that of Ideas as\ndivine thoughts, one of the features of Imperial Platonism (Dillon\n1996). Unlike Plato in the Timaeus, Philo does not assert\nthat the Ideas are exterior to the Creator. For him God is, through\nhis logos, the only active cause. The world of the Ideas, the\nno\u00e8tos kosmos, is that of God\u2019s thoughts.\nDespite many nuances, variations, and even contradictions, there is in\nPhilo the same triple structure common to many Middle Platonic texts:\nthe God/Demiurge, the first principle; the Ideas and powers by which\nGod acts on matter; and matter itself. However, it must be added that\nin Philo everything is both similar and different. His God is not the\nDemiurge; he does not define powers and Ideas with reference to\nmathematical principles, though arithmology is quite present in his\ncommentaries; and his conception of matter, despite many allusions to\nthe philosophical doctrine of the dyad (the formless and unlimited\nbase), has deep Biblical roots. \n\nIt may be useful at this point to address the question of Pythagorean\ninfluence on Philo. In Probus 2, he speaks of the\n\u201choliest sect\u201d of the Pythagoreans, a highly admiring\nexpression. In fact, the quite numerous mentions of this\n\u201csect\u201d in his treatises are a confirmation of his\nfascination for it. He admires Pythagorean elitism (Probus\n2), and sees in the ban against pronouncing their Master\u2019s name\nsomething akin to the Jewish idea of divine ineffability (QG\n1.99). He explicitly mentions twice Pythagorean sources: in\nAet. 2, where he says, as we have seen, that he read a\ntreatise of Ocellus; and in Opif. 100, there is a complex\npassage about the number seven, likened by the Pythagoreans to Zeus,\nthe \u201cDirector and Ruler of all things\u201d. In QG\n2.12, arithmology is explicitly evoked as a Pythagorean science.\nNevertheless, his allusions to Pythagorean themes are often vague and\nmerit further analysis. As an example, Philo is often willing to use\nadjectives by which Pythagoreans characterized the dyad but reluctant\nto use the word itself. And when he does so, he clarifies in a very\npersonal manner that \u201cthe monad is the image of the\nfirst Cause\u201d and the dyad that of \u201cthe matter passive and\nindivisible\u201d (Spec. 3.180). Monad and dyad serve Philo\nas exegetical tools, not actual substitutes for the narrative of\nCreation in the Bible. It is as if the imperative not to coincide\nexactly with Greek philosophical doctrine was for Philo an obligation\nof identity.\n",
