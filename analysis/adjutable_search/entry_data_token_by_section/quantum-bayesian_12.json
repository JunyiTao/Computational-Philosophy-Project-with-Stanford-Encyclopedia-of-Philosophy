    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Should a QBist believe that an agent prepares a physically real state?\n2.6 Should a QBist believe that an agent prepares a physically real state?\n\nA QBist is convinced that an agent should take quantum mechanics as a\nguide for setting her subjective degrees of belief about the outcomes\nof future measurements. Myrvold (2020a,b) has used results of Pusey,\nBarrett and Rudolph (2012) and Barrett, Cavalcanti, Lal, and Maroney\n(2014) to argue that anyone with that conviction should also believe\nthat preparations with which she associates distinct pure quantum\nstates result in ontically distinct states of affairs, a conclusion\nthat QBists reject.\n\nHis argument depends on results proved within the ontological models\nframework of Harrigan and Spekkens (2010). Myrvold defends this\nframework as merely codifying a form of reasoning implicit in much of\nscience and daily life which there is no good reason to reject when\napplied in the quantum domain. One reasons that an action on a\nphysical system affects what one will experience later only via the\nphysical transmission of that action\u2019s effect from the system to\nevents one later experiences. If so, then the action of preparing a\nsystem\u2019s quantum state must affect some physical property of the\nsystem reflected in what the framework calls its ontic state.\n\nIn response, QBists insist that quantum states have no ontic hold on\nthe world and that the QBist notion of quantum indeterminism is a far\nmore radical variety than anything proposed in the quantum debate\nbefore because it says that nature does what it wants, without a\nmechanism underneath (Fuchs 2017b, p. 272; 2018, p. 19). The QBist\nSchack rejects Myrvold\u2019s form of reasoning in the quantum domain\nas follows (Schack 2018).\n\n\nThere are no laws that determine objective probabilities for\nmeasurement outcomes. The world does not evolve according to a\nmechanism.\n\n",
