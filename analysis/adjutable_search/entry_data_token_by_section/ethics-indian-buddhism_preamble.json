    "main_text": "\n\nBuddhism represents a vast and rich intellectual tradition which,\nuntil recently, received very little influence from Western\nphilosophy. This tradition contains a variety of teachings about how\nto live and what to do in various situations. Buddhism tells us to\npurify our own minds and to develop lovingkindness and compassion for\nall beings. The various forms of Buddhism offer systematic frameworks\nfor understanding the traits of character and types of actions that\ncause problems for ourselves and others, as well as those qualities\nand actions that help to heal the suffering of the world. When\nstarting a Buddhist path, one agrees to follow rules of moral\ndiscipline that forbid various destructive actions; but once the mind\nhas reached a very high degree of spiritual development, the rules are\ntranscended and one acts spontaneously for the benefit of others.\n\nBuddhism upholds lofty and demanding ethical values, but recognizes\nthe need to adapt those values to the conditions of the real world.\nFrom a Buddhist point of view, animal life is precious, and human life\nis even more so. Ideally we should refrain from killing animals, adopt\na vegetarian diet, renounce all forms of violence and live in harmony\nwith nature. Yet there are some difficult cases in which violence and\nkilling seem almost unavoidable. Some Buddhist writers have offered\nguidance on how to act appropriately and realistically in such\nsituations, without abandoning the compassion and lovingkindness that\nform the basis of the Buddhist approach to ethics.\n",
