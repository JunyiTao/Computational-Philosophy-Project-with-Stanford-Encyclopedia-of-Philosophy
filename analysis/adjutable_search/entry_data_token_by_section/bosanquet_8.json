    "main_text": "Principal Contributions || Social Work and Adult Education\n4. General Assessment\n\nInterest in Bosanquet\u2019s work\u2014as with idealism as a\nwhole\u2014waned during the middle decades of the 20th\ncentury. Of the idealists, the writings of Bradley and, in political\ntheory, Green, are now much better known. There is no simple\nexplanation of this; many factors seem relevant.\n\nFirst, some of the work that made Bosanquet\u2019s reputation in his\ntime\u2014his popular essays, the books and articles that came out of\nhis university extension courses, and his involvement in social\npolicy\u2014now seems largely dated. Bosanquet\u2019s association\nwith the majority report of the Poor Law Reform Commission and his\nalleged championing of the nation state, led many to see him as a\nconservative if not reactionary thinker whose contributions to social\nand public policy, and to political philosophy, were outdated almost\nas soon as they had been published.\n\nIt has been suggested, as well, that some of the concepts central to\nBosanquet\u2019s work are problematic or not clearly defined, and\nthat several of his essays lack the logical rigor that one finds in\nmaterial destined for the more specialized audience of academic\nphilosophers. While insightful and wide ranging\u2014and while\naccessible to a much wider audience than the work of other idealists,\nsuch as Bradley and J.M.E. McTaggart\u2014Bosanquet\u2019s writings\nlack the sharpness, the density, and, at times, the outrageousness of\nthose of some of his contemporaries.\n\nIt is also fair to say that Bosanquet himself was an indifferent\nliterary stylist. His work often betrays a looseness that one tends to\nfind in texts based on lectures prepared for general audiences or for\nclasses, and he wrote that \u201cI usually rush my books, I get so\ntired of them\u201d (Muirhead 1935: 131). His early work on logic was\nalso remarked upon for its \u201cstiffness\u201d (ibid., p.\n58). But these primarily stylistic issues may also be a consequence of\nBosanquet\u2019s refusal to sever philosophical analysis from the\nexperience which Bosanquet was trying to investigate.\n\nThere are other reasons that no doubt contributed to the decline of\ninterest in Bosanquet\u2019s work. By the early part of the\n20th century, philosophical idealism as a whole was seen by\nmany as a philosophical dead-end, with figures such as G.E. Moore,\nBertrand Russell, and A.J. Ayer challenging what they saw as its\nirredeemably obscure vocabulary, as well as its questionable\nunderlying speculative metaphysics.\n\nNevertheless, the influence and legacy of Bosanquet, and of British\nidealism in general, should not be underestimated. \n\nOne area in which today one sees a resonance or legacy is in political\nand social thought; Bosanquet\u2019s arguments have been seen as at\nleast close\u2014or even a preferred alternative\u2014to the work of\nsome contemporary communitarians. Bosanquet\u2019s emphasis on the\nimportance of a common good, on the social character of the\nindividual, and on the fundamental place of substantive social ends\nwithin a community, are echoed in the more recent writings of Charles\nTaylor (1992) and Alasdair MacIntyre (1990). Other authors (such as\nGerald Gaus [1983, 1994, 2001]) see in Bosanquet\u2019s work a model\nof a substantive liberalism.\n\nA second area that is beginning to be explored is that of\nBosanquet\u2019s relation to philosophers of succeeding generations\nin Britain, such as R.G. Collingwood and Michael Oakeshott.\nCollingwood, for example, discusses Bosanquet\u2019s political\nphilosophy in his unpublished \u201cNotes Towards a Theory of\nPolitics as a Philosophical Science\u201d (see Connelly 2002), and\nOakeshott regarded The Philosophical Theory of the State as\n\u201cthe only theory which has paid thoroughgoing attention to all\nthe problems which must be considered by a theory of the State\u201d\n(Oakeshott 1936).\n\nOther areas that have been the subject of some recent study are\nBosanquet\u2019s views on religion and on logic. Bosanquet is known\nto have had an influence on the \u2018social gospel\u2019 of the\nEnglish theologian and future Archbishop of Canterbury, William\nTemple. More broadly, Bosanquet\u2019s emphasis on the moral, and not\ndoctrinal, character of religious belief is, as noted earlier,\nreflected in recent work in the study of religion. While many accept\nthe standard view that idealist logic was problematic and no rival for\nthe later logic of Russell and Wittgenstein, it bears noting that,\ngiven Bosanquet\u2019s view of the centrality of logic to philosophy,\nhe engaged and debated then-current developments in logic, such as\nthat of Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, and Russell. For example, in\nthe posthumously published Three Chapters on the Nature of\nMind (1923), Bosanquet closely examines Russell\u2019s account\nin The Analysis of Mind, claiming that there were many points\non which both were in agreement, and that Russell\u2019s view was not\nso much wrong as \u201ctoo narrow\u201d. It has also been argued\nthat Bosanquet\u2019s views on logic and scientific method are close\nto those of some contemporary critics of empirical accounts of natural\nlaws. \n\nJust as the recent exploration of the origins of analytic philosophy\nhave led some authors to look more closely at its relations with\nBritish idealism, the intellectual roots of Bosanquet\u2019s idealism\nalso need to be more thoroughly explored. Though Bosanquet\u2019s\ndebt to the writings of Hegel and Kant is relatively well-known, there\nwere a number of other important influences on his work (see Sweet\n1995). Perhaps the most significant is that of classical Greek\nthought, and it is only recently recognised that Bosanquet\u2019s\nphilosophy cannot be fully appreciated without am appreciation of his\ndebt to Greek philosophy.\n\nFinally, even as Bosanquet\u2019s influence, and that of British\nidealism as a whole, diminished at home, they continued for some time\nafterward in other countries of the English-speaking world. Thus,\naside from the \u2018third generation\u2019 of idealists or\nidealist-influenced philosophers in Britain (such as Collingwood,\nMichael Oakeshott, and Dorothy Emmet), Bosanquet\u2019s thought also\nhad an impact in English-language philosophy in Canada (with John\nWatson), in South Africa (with R.F.A. Hoernl\u00e9 (see Sweet 2010),\nA.R. Lord (see Sweet 2005), and Andrew Murray), and in India (with\nHiralal Haldar, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and Benoy Ray) (see Sweet\n2011). \n\nIn recent years, then, there has been a renewed interest in\nBosanquet\u2019s work\u2014particularly concerning his philosophical\nand social thought. Given the number of studies published during the\npast forty years on Hegel, Green and, more recently, Bradley, and\ngiven the reevaluation of the significance of the work of British\nidealism and its place in the history of philosophy, there has been a\nsteady reconsideration of the contribution of Bosanquet\u2019s\nphilosophy as well.\n",
