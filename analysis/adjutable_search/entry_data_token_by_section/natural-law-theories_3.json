    "main_text": "Enabling positivity: social facts made reasons for action || Rule of law as remedy for the dangers in having rulers\n1.3 Rule of law as remedy for the dangers in having rulers\n\n\nAristotle (Politics III.15.1286a\u2013IV 4 1292a) vigorously\ndebates the question whether political authority is better exercised\nthrough a \u201crule [primacy, supremacy] of law\u201d or \u201ca\nrule of men,\u201d say of one best person, or a democratic assembly,\nor indeed (Rhetoric I 1 1354a32\u2013b16) a court. He takes\nhis arguments to suggest the answer that in almost all societies, on\nalmost all occasions and issues, it is preferable that government be\nby or in accordance with law, since (i) laws are products of reason(s)\nnot passion(s), (ii) the sovereignty of a ruler or assembly tends to\ntyranny (i.e., rule in interests of a section, not common good), (iii)\nequality demands that each mature person have some share in governing,\nand (iv) rotation of offices and office-holders is desirable and can\nhardly be managed without legal regulation. So for Aristotle, the\ncentral case of practical authority is government of a polis\nby law and legally regulated rulers.\n\n\nThomas Aquinas\u2019 account of human positive law treats the central\ncase of government as the self-government of a free people by the\nrulers and institutions which that people has appointed for that\npurpose, and the central case of law is the co-ordination of willing\nsubjects by law which, by its public character (promulgation),\nclarity, generality, stability and practicability, treats those\nsubjects as partners in public reason (Summa Theologiae I-II\nq. 90 a. 4c; q. 95 a. 3c; q. 96 a. 1; q. 97 a. 2). For he defines law\nas universal (in the logician\u2019s sense of \u201cuniversal\u201d)\npractical propositions conceived in the reason of the ruler(s) and\ncommunicated to the reason of the ruled so that the latter will treat\nthose propositions, at least presumptively, as reasons for \naction\u2014reasons as decisive for each of them as if each had conceived\nand adopted them by personal judgment and choice.\n\n\nLon Fuller 1969, acknowledging Aquinas\u2019 lead in this discussion of\nformal and procedural aspects of legal system, pulls together Aquinas\u2019\nscattered and fragmentary remarks about them into an orderly list of\neight elements of the rule of law, that is of la\nprimaut\u00e9 du droit, the legal system of a\nRechtsstaat. He shows that these hang together as a set of\ndesiderata (or requirements) because they are implications or\nspecifications of the aspiration and duty to treat people as\npresumptively entitled\u2014as a matter of fairness and\njustice\u2014to be ruled as free persons, fundamentally the equals of\ntheir rulers, not puppets or pawns to be managed and kept in order by\nmanipulation, uncertainty, fear, etc. The normal result of such\nfairness in the procedures of making and maintaining the law will be\nto strengthen the law\u2019s efficacy, too. Unfortunately, the surface of\nFuller\u2019s text gives more prominence to effectiveness than to fairness,\nand many critics (e.g., Hart, Dworkin), overlooking the moral\nconnotations of Fuller\u2019s allusions to reciprocity between\nrulers and ruled, thought his book\u2019s title, The Morality of\nLaw, a misnomer. This thesis has been elaborated more carefully\nand on a different basis by Raz 1979 and Kramer 2004a and 2004b:\nalthough the rule of law (and compliance with it) can be morally\nimportant and even a moral virtue (because normally necessary for\nfully just government in a just society, and especially for\nalleviating dangers that arise from the existence of political\nauthority, and of law itself), it is nonetheless in itself morally\nneutral since (in states which employ the forms of law) it will\nnormally be needed even by deeply unjust rulers for advancing their\nimmoral purposes. It is like a sharp knife, whose sharpness makes it\napt for life-saving surgery but equally for stealthy callous murders\n(Raz 1979, 224\u20136).\n\n\nFinnis 1980 (273\u20134) and Simmonds 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 have\nchallenged the quasi-empirical claim that even vicious tyrants need or\nfind it apt, for the efficacy of their domination, to comply with the\nrequirements of the rule of law. The eighth of Fuller\u2019s elements of\nthe rule of law, viz. adherence by the rulers to their own rules in\ntheir conduct of government, is especially obstructive, rather than\nsupportive, of a tyranny\u2019s purposes. But the focus of Fuller\u2019s\nconcern, and the most fruitful locus of debate, is not so much on\nhistorical or sociological phenomena or causalities as on the\n\u201cinternal,\u201d practical reasons at stake. If the rulers\nsomewhere do not respect the rights and interests of some of their\nsubjects in relation to issues of substance (life, bodily security,\nfreedom, property, and so forth), why should the rulers\u2014what\nreason have they to\u2014respect their subjects\u2019 rights or interests\nin the matters of procedure involved in the rule of law (giving them\nfair notice of what is expected of them, and adhering as rulers to the\npromulgated law when assessing these subjects\u2019 conduct and in other\ngovernmental dealings with those subjects)?  A more or less\ninconsistent willingness of rulers to tie their own hands by\nscrupulous adherence to procedural justice while yet being\nsubstantively unjust, is of course psychologically possible. But\nFuller\u2019s primary concern, like that of the wider tradition of natural\nlaw theory, is with rationality and the specific implication of fully\ncoherent reasonableness: morally reasonable judgment and\nchoice.\n",
