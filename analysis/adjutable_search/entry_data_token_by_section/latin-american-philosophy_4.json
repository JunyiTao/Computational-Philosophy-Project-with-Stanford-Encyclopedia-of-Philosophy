    "main_text": "The Contemporary Period || Maturity (1960\u2013present)\n2.3 Maturity (1960\u2013present)\n\nBy the 1960s, philosophy in Latin America had indisputably reached a\nlevel of philosophical maturity. The work had markedly increased in\noriginality and depth, and some of it achieved international\nvisibility. This period of maturity continues to the present. To\nappreciate the distinctiveness of this new situation, it helps to\nrecall that the period of normalcy was characterized by (1) critical\ninteraction with the philosophical ideas coming from outside Latin\nAmerica, (2) an increase in dialogue within Latin America, and (3) the\ninstitutionalization of philosophy. In the period of maturity, these\nfeatures became stable and the general caliber of philosophical work\ncontinued to improve accordingly.\n\nIf one measures philosophical activity by the number of new journals\nfounded, or by the number of important congresses that occur, one might\nmistakenly conclude that philosophical activity actually diminished\nafter the 1960s. However, many of the journals founded in the preceding\ntwenty years continued publication, so there was actually a net\nincrease in fora for philosophical work. Moreover, more than a dozen\nimportant congresses and philosophical meetings took place between 1960\nand 1980. In short, the activity related to publications and\nprofessional meetings had reached a healthy level of\nstability. \n\nFour philosophical currents deserve special attention at this period\nbecause of their growing influence and the new ideas and approaches\nthey introduced in Latin American philosophy: socialist and Marxist\nthought (broadly conceived), philosophical analysis, the philosophy of\nliberation, and the history of philosophy. \n\nLatin America has had a long and notable history of receptivity to\nsocialist thought. Its introduction goes back to the nineteenth\ncentury. The impact of the socialist ideas of Claude Henri de\nSaint-Simon (1790\u20131825) and Charles Fourier (1772\u20131873) are clearly\nvisible in the treatise Dogma socialista of Esteban\nEchevarr\u00eda (1805\u20131851). In the twentieth century, Emilio Frugoni\n(1880\u20131969) in Uruguay and Mari\u00e1tegui in Peru, among others,\ndeveloped Marxist accounts, although frequently in heterodox terms.\nFor example, Mari\u00e1tegui allowed that there is no essential\nconflict between religious thought and Marxism, departing from the\nstandard materialist, atheist commitments of orthodox Marxism. He also\nheld that the conception of economic stages in Marx, modeled on Europe,\ndid not apply to Peru. Although bourgeois liberal\ncapitalism had not materialized in Peru, he held that the only way to\nmove forward was to transition to socialism.\n\nLatin American Marxism has been diverse in its philosophical\nparticulars, and is subject to ongoing development. Even so, many\nforms of Latin American Marxism commitments to the following: (1) an\nend to imperialism, neo-colonialism and class oppression through\nsocialist democratic change and/or revolution; (2) a form of socialist\nhumanism based on (a) ending the capitalist exploitation of human\nbeing by human being, and (b) upholding a model of dignity based on\neconomic and social equality; (3) a conception of philosophy as\ncommitted to understanding the world in all its dynamic and\ninterrelated aspects, theorizing the meanings of capitalism and\nsocialism, and shedding light on acting accordingly.  Class\nconsciousness of workers, the proletariat, or the people is typically\nregarded as an important engine of social change. Apart from these\nshared commitments, Antonio Gramsci\u2019s (1891\u20131937) influential\nmodel of \u201corganic intellectuals\u201d\u2014intellectuals who\nsupport social revolution with critical perspectives\u2014also\nresonated with a range of leftist intellectuals who lent their support\nto Marxist revolutionary movements in Cuba, Nicaragua, and\nelsewhere.[4]\n\nDespite a long-standing openness to various strands of socialist\nthought, it was only after 1960 that Marxism gained notable academic\nstanding throughout Latin America. Indeed, Harold Davis claimed,\nplausibly enough, that Marxism became the most common ideological\nconviction among professionals in the decades following the\n1960s. Mari\u00e1tegui continues to loom large in characterizations\nof a distinctively Latin American form of Marxism. However, other\nimportant figures in academic Marxism emerged in the contemporary\nperiod, including Adolfo S\u00e1nchez V\u00e1zquez\n(1915\u20132011), of Spanish origin but working in Mexico, and the\nBrazilian Caio Prado Junior (1907\u20131990).\n\nThe popularity of the Marxism has made possible its\nwidespread institutionalization and its impact on virtually\nall active philosophical approaches in Latin America. To be sure, it is\nnot without its critics, many of whom charge that a philosophy that\naims to change the world is not philosophy at all, or that its scope is\nentirely too limited for an entire discipline. Nevertheless, it is not\nmuch of an exaggeration to say that, broadly speaking, Marxist themes\nare widely present in Latin American philosophy, even if philosophers\npursuing an explicitly Marxist philosophical research program remain in\nthe minority.\n\nCompared to Marxism, analytic philosophy was a late arrival to Latin\nAmerica. Owing to its technical and academic character, analytic\nphilosophy\u2019s initial influence was small.  Its historical connection\nwith Logical Positivism caused many to reject it because of its\nperceived commonality with nineteenth century positivism. However, in\na relatively short period of time, analytic philosophy became one of\nthe most forceful philosophical currents in Latin America. The\npublication of the journals Cr\u00edtica in Mexico,\nAn\u00e1lisis Filos\u00f3fico in Argentina, and\nManuscrito in Brazil, the foundation of the Society of\nPhilosophical Analysis (SADAF) in Argentina, and the growth of\npublications of an analytic bent in journals of neutral philosophical\norientation, testify to the fact that philosophical analysis is now\nwell established in Latin\n America.[5]\n\nAn important dimension of this was the international uptake of some of\nthis work. Some analytic philosophers from Latin America attracted the\nattention of philosophers in Europe (particularly in England and\nGermany), the United States, and Canada. In addition, Latin American\nphilosophers who emigrated or made extended visits to these countries\nproduced important work. Three areas of contributions stand out: the\nphilosophy of human rights, legal theory, and logic. Eduardo Rabossi\n(1930\u20132005) work on human rights in Latin America attracted the\nattention of major English and American philosophers. Carlos Nino\u2019s\n(1943\u20131993) work in the philosophy of law, such as his\nconsensual theory of punishment, has been widely recognized as an\noriginal contribution to philosophy and jurisprudence (see Navarro in\nNuccetelli et. al., 2010). Finally, Latin American work in logic has\nbeen particularly fecund. Newton C. A. da Costa (b. 1929) has done\nconsiderable work on paraconsistent logic that has been the subject of\ninternational attention (see da Costa & Bueno 2010). Carlos Eduardo\nAlchourr\u00f3n\u2019s (1985) contributions to the AGM model of belief\nchange (named after Alchourr\u00f3n and his collaborators, Peter\nG\u00e4rdenfors and David Makinson) has also been\ninfluential. Although its underpinnings were initially developed from\nAlchourr\u00f3n and Makinson\u2019s efforts at modeling changes in legal\ncodes, it is now the dominant formal framework for modeling belief\nrevision.\n\nThe growing influence of analytic philosophy in Latin America has not\ngone without criticism. It is not uncommon to hear that analytic\nphilosophers lack sensitivity to the pressing problems affecting Latin\nAmerica. Although this concern is hardly unique to analytic\nphilosophy, it is also sometimes merited. However, it is also true\nthat the rigorous argumentation, analysis of language, and use of\nsymbolic logic often constitute obstacles for outsiders to this\nmethodology. Nevertheless, Latin American analytic philosophers have\noften been involved in socially pertinent issues.  Indeed, both\nRabossi and Nino were involved in the politics of Argentina, serving\nin the government of President Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn. Da Costa\nand Alchourr\u00f3n both applied their logical theories to law and a\nvariety of arguably \u201cpractical\u201d problems. Moreover, a variety of Latin\nAmerican analytic philosophers have been centrally preoccupied with\nethical and political questions. In the wake of the 1994 Zapatista\nrebellion, a number of prominent Mexican philosophers (including\nFernando Salmer\u00f3n and Luis Villoro) became involved in public\nand academic efforts at addressing the concerns of the Zapatistas.\n\nA third contemporary approach that merits special attention is the\nphilosophy of liberation . This autochthonous philosophical perspective\nstarted in the early 1970s with a group of Argentinian philosophers,\nmost notably Arturo Andr\u00e9s Roig (1922\u20132012), Horacio\nCerutti-Guldberg (b. 1950), and Enrique Dussel (b. 1934), with Dussel\nbeing primarily responsible for spreading the philosophy of liberation\noutside of Latin America. This philosophy shares some of its\nintellectual touchstones with the theology of liberation\u2014in\nparticular, indebtedness to dependency theory, as well as Catholic and\nMarxist ideas. Some of the most significant features of the various\nstrands of the movement include the aspiration for Latin American\nintellectual independence, an emphasis on economic autonomy as opposed\nto economic dependence, an emphasis on political regimes that are\nresponsive to the interest of the poor and indigenous populations, and\nin general, a concern to put Third World realities at the center of\nphilosophical concerns.\n\nThe international visibility of the philosophy of liberation was in\npart an unanticipated consequence of military repression in 1976\u201383 in\nArgentina. The founding figures of the philosophy of liberation went\ninto exile in various countries in Latin America. Although this early\ndiaspora created permanent splits in the\nmovement\u2014Cerutti-Guldberg urges that one speak of\n\u201cphilosophies of liberation\u201d\u2014its ideas spread\nthroughout the region.\n\nThe goal of intellectual independence, important to many varieties of\nthe philosophy of liberation, was not new with the philosophy of\nliberation. Strands of it can be found in the work of Ramos and others\nin the early parts of the 20th century. Other forerunners\ninclude the culturalist and historicist views of Leopoldo Zea, which\nemphasize the distinctiveness of Latin America and its history.\nMoreover, Augusto Salazar Bondy\u2019s (1925\u20131974) concern for\nintellectual authenticity, informed by dependency theory, paved the way\nfor important developments in the philosophy of liberation. However,\nthe distinctive feature of the philosophy of liberation is the degree\nto which it has developed the theme of liberation into a\nfar-reaching and systematic critique of European (and later, United\nStates) dominance in intellectual, economic, and social worlds. In\nparticular, philosophers of liberation charge that the intellectual and\neconomic frameworks of Europe and the United States are distinguished\n(currently and historically) by a disregard for or hostility to the\nconcerns of those outside the systems of power central to Europe and\nthe United States.\n\nThe philosophy of liberation has been subject to varied criticisms.\nThere is a rich tradition of disagreements internal to the movement\n(Cerutti-Guldberg 1983), and even those sympathetic with aspects of it\nhave charged that its proponents have failed to adequately accommodate\nconcerns about gender and sexuality (Schutte 1993), that it is\ninsufficiently attentive to the way identity categories work (Alcoff\n2000), and that despite its condemnation of Eurocentrism, it too is\nEurocentric (Vargas 2005).\n\nAlthough analytic philosophers (whether in Latin America or abroad)\nhave generally ignored the philosophy of liberation (or else dismissed\nit as unrigorous or unphilosophical), this philosophical perspective\nhas arguably had more impact outside of Latin America than any other\nLatin American philosophical development. In particular, Dussel has\nbeen in dialogue with a variety of philosophers in Europe (including\nApel, Ricoeur, and Habermas), and with Continental-influenced\nphilosophers in the United States and elsewhere (e.g., Rorty, Taylor,\nAlcoff, and\n Mendieta).[6]\n\nThe fourth philosophical current in the Latin American contemporary\nscene worth noting is not properly an orientation but a field of study:\nthe history of philosophy. Philosophical productivity in this area is\nworthy of note because its impact has been considerably among\nphilosophers of diverse persuasions. Before 1960, both the quantity and\nthe quality of studies on the history of philosophy published in Latin\nAmerica were often deplorable. Most works amounted to panegyrics, or\nmere paraphrases of texts not available in Spanish translation.\nMoreover, complete periods of the history of philosophy remained\noutside the scope of those studies. Since 1960, the situation has\nchanged substantially. There are now works that deal with practically\nevery period of the history of Western philosophy, and even Eastern\nphilosophy. Moreover, a good proportion of those studies are serious,\nrevealing knowledge of the pertinent languages and primary sources and\nadding a critical element without which the history of philosophy\nbecomes merely a gloss.\n\nA development that should be noted in this regard is the appearance of\njournals specializing in the history and thought of some historical\nperiods. For example, the last decade saw the appearance of journals\ndevoted to the study of the Middle Ages. Although not all these\njournals are strictly speaking philosophical, their publication is\nimportant, because it indicates the existence of the technical\nbackground doubtlessly necessary for serious historical research. It\nalso reveals the dedication of Latin American intellectual groups to\nwhat might be called \u201cpure research\u201d\u2014the search for\nknowledge for its own sake without consideration of its immediate\npractical applications.\n\nCollectively, these facts demonstrate a thematic dexterity in handling\nphilosophical ideas and arguments, a fact that led Mir\u00f3 Quesada\nto characterize the generations of Latin American philosophers in the\nperiod of maturity as \u2018technical\u2019. Philosophy has become a\nspecialized and professional discipline in Latin America. Indeed, since\n1960, Latin American philosophy has achieved a degree of maturity that\ncompares well with the state of the profession in Europe and the United\nStates.\n\nA final recent development in the United States merits mention in\nconnection with Latin American philosophy. There are now several\ngenerations of distinguished philosophers of Hispanic or Latin\nAmerican descent have worked in the United States and Canada,\ncontributing to traditional philosophical fields such as metaphysics,\nepistemology, and the history of philosophy. Among these are George\nSantayana (1863\u20131952), H\u00e9ctor-Neri Cata\u00f1eda\n(1924\u20131991), Mario Bunge (b. 1919), Ernesto Sosa (b. 1940),\nJorge J. E. Gracia (b. 1942), and Linda M. Alcoff, among others.\n\nIn the last two or three decades a new sense of Latino/a\nidentity in philosophy has grown among a group of philosophers who have\nundertaken work in areas related to Hispanic/Latino issues and have\nidentified themselves as Hispanics or Latinos/as. Among senior\nphilosophers who have been more clearly identified with this movement\nare two from the mentioned group (Alcoff and Gracia), as well as\nothers, such as J. Angelo Corlett, Susana Nuccetelli, Eduardo Mendieta,\nand Ofelia Schutte. These philosophers have contributed in particular\nto the discourse on issues of race, ethnicity, nationality, and\nfeminism, particularly through an analysis of ethnic, racial, and\ngender identity. One striking feature of much of this work is the\nremarkable degree to which it is explicitly informed by, or engaged\nwith, Latin American philosophy and its history.\n",
