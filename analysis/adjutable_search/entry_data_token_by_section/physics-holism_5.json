    "main_text": "Spatial and Spatiotemporal Nonseparability\n6. Spatial and Spatiotemporal Nonseparability\n\nThe idea is familiar (particularly to Lego enthusiasts!) that if one\nconstructs a physical object by assembling its physical parts, then\nthe physical properties of that object are wholly determined by the\nproperties of the parts and the way it is put together from them. A\nprinciple of spatial separability tries to capture that idea.\n\nSpatial Separability:\n The qualitative intrinsic physical properties of a compound system\nare supervenient on those of its spatially separated component systems\ntogether with the spatial relations among these component systems.\n\n\nIf we identify the real state of a system with its qualitative\nintrinsic physical properties, then spatial separability is related to\na separability principle stated by Howard (1985, p. 173) to the effect\nthat any two spatially separated systems possess their own separate\nreal states. It is even more closely related to Einstein\u2019s\n(1935)\n real state separability principle.\n Indeed, Einstein formulated this principle in the context of a pair\n\\(A, B\\) of spatially separated systems.\n\nSpatial nonseparability\n \u2014the denial of spatial separability\u2014is also closely\nrelated to\n physical property holism.\n At least classically, spatial relations are the only clear examples\nof qualitative intrinsic physical relations required in the\nsupervenience basis for physical property determination/holism: other\nintrinsic physical relations seem to supervene on them, while any\ninstance of physical property holism due to the spatial separation of\nbasic physical parts would entail spatial nonseparability. But if one\nthought a spatially localized object has a determinate value for a\nmagnitude like mass only by virtue of its mass relations to other such\nobjects elsewhere then one might decide to include those relations in\nthe supervenience basis also (see Dasgupta (2013)).\n\nIf we take a spacetime perspective, then spatial separability\nnaturally generalizes to\n\nSpatiotemporal Separability:\n Any physical process occupying spacetime region R\nsupervenes upon an assignment of qualitative intrinsic physical\nproperties at spacetime points in R.\n\n\nSpatiotemporal separability is a natural restriction to physics of\nDavid Lewis\u2019s (1986, p. x) principle of Humean supervenience. It\nis also closely related to another principle formulated by Einstein\n(1948, pp. 233\u2013234 of Howard\u2019s (1989) translation) in the\nfollowing words: \u201cAn essential aspect of [the] arrangement of\nthings in physics is that they lay claim, at a certain time, to an\nexistence independent of one another, provided these objects\n\u2018are situated in different parts of space\u2019\u201d (the\ncontext of the quote suggests that Einstein intended his principle to\napply to objects provided they\u00a0occupy spacelike separated regions\nof spacetime).\n\nAs Healey (1991, p. 411) shows, spatiotemporal separability entails\nspatial separability, and so spatial nonseparability entails\nspatiotemporal nonseparability. Because it is both more general and\nmore consonant with a geometric spacetime viewpoint, it seems\nreasonable to consider spatiotemporal separability to be the primary\nnotion. Accordingly, separability without further qualification will\nmean spatiotemporal separability in what follows, and nonseparability\nwill be understood as its denial.\n\nNonseparability:\n Some physical process occupying a region R of\nspacetime is not supervenient upon an assignment of qualitative\nintrinsic physical properties at spacetime points in R.\n\n\nIt is important to note that nonseparability entails neither\n physical property holism\n nor\n spatial nonseparability:\n a process may be nonseparable even though it involves objects without\nproper parts. But this section has explained that either of the latter\nprinciples entails nonseparability under quite weak assumptions.\n",
