They propose formal criteria for\nevaluating analogies, based on overall structural or syntactical\nsimilarity. Let us refer to theories oriented around such criteria as\nstructuralist.\n\nA number of leading computational models of analogy are structuralist.\nThey are implemented in computer programs that begin with (or\nsometimes build) representations of the source and target domains, and\nthen construct possible analogy mappings. Analogical inferences emerge\nas a consequence of identifying the \u2018best mapping.\u2019 In\nterms of criteria for analogical reasoning, there are two main ideas.\nFirst, the goodness of an analogical argument is based on the\ngoodness of the associated analogy mapping. Second, the\ngoodness of the analogy mapping is given by a metric that indicates\nhow closely it approximates isomorphism.\n\nThe most influential structuralist theory has been Gentner\u2019s\nstructure-mapping theory, implemented in a program called the\nstructure-mapping engine (SME). In its original form (Gentner\n1983), the theory assesses analogies on purely structural grounds.\nGentner asserts:\n\n\nAnalogies are about relations, rather than simple features. No matter\nwhat kind of knowledge (causal models, plans, stories, etc.), it is\nthe structural properties (i.e., the interrelationships between the\nfacts) that determine the content of an analogy. (Falkenhainer,\nForbus, and Gentner 1989/90: 3)\n\n\nIn order to clarify this thesis, Gentner introduces a distinction\nbetween properties, or monadic predicates, and\nrelations, which have multiple arguments. She further\ndistinguishes among different orders of relations and\nfunctions, defined inductively (in terms of the order of the relata or\narguments). The best mapping is determined by systematicity:\nthe extent to which it places higher-order relations, and items that\nare nested in higher-order relations, in correspondence.\nGentner\u2019s Systematicity Principle states:\n\n\nA predicate that belongs to a mappable system of mutually\ninterconnecting relationships is more likely to be imported into the\ntarget than is an isolated predicate. (1983: 163)\n\n\nA systematic analogy (one that places high-order relations and their\ncomponents in correspondence) is better than a less systematic\nanalogy. Hence, an analogical inference has a degree of plausibility\nthat increases monotonically with the degree of systematicity of the\nassociated analogy mapping. Gentner\u2019s fundamental criterion for\nevaluating candidate analogies (and analogical inferences) thus\ndepends solely upon the syntax of the given representations and not at\nall upon their content.\n\nLater versions of the structure-mapping theory incorporate refinements\n(Forbus, Ferguson, and Gentner 1994; Forbus 2001; Forbus et al. 2007;\nForbus et al. 2008; Forbus et al 2017). For example, the earliest\nversion of the theory is vulnerable to worries about hand-coded\nrepresentations of source and target domains. Gentner and her\ncolleagues have attempted to solve this problem in later work that\ngenerates LISP representations from natural language text (see Turney\n2008 for a different approach).\n\nThe most important challenges for the structure-mapping approach\nrelate to the Systematicity Principle itself. Does the value\nof an analogy derive entirely, or even chiefly, from systematicity?\nThere appear to be two main difficulties with this view. First: it is\nnot always appropriate to give priority to systematic, high-level\nrelational matches. Material criteria, and notably what Gentner refers\nto as \u201csuperficial feature matches,\u201d can be extremely\nimportant in some types of analogical reasoning, such as ethnographic\nanalogies which are based, to a considerable degree, on surface\nresemblances between artifacts. Second and more significantly:\nsystematicity seems to be at best a fallible marker for good\nanalogies rather than the essence of good analogical reasoning.\n\nGreater systematicity is neither necessary nor sufficient for a more\nplausible analogical inference. It is obvious that increased\nsystematicity is not sufficient for increased plausibility.\nAn implausible analogy can be represented in a form that exhibits a\nhigh degree of structural parallelism. High-order relations can come\ncheap, as we saw with Achinstein\u2019s \u201cswan\u201d example\n (\u00a72.4).\n\nMore pointedly, increased systematicity is not necessary for\ngreater plausibility. Indeed, in causal analogies, it may even weaken\nthe inference. That is because systematicity takes no account\nof the type of causal relevance, positive or negative. (McKay\n1993) notes that microbes have been found in frozen lakes in\nAntarctica; by analogy, simple life forms might exist on Mars.\nFreezing temperatures are preventive or counteracting causes;\nthey are negatively relevant to the existence of life. The\nclimate of Mars was probably more favorable to life 3.5\nbillion years ago than it is today, because temperatures were warmer.\nYet the analogy between Antarctica and present-day Mars is more\nsystematic than the analogy between Antarctica and ancient Mars.\nAccording to the Systematicity Principle, the analogy with\nAntarctica provides stronger support for life on Mars today than it\ndoes for life on ancient Mars.\n\nThe point of this example is that increased systematicity does not\nalways increase plausibility, and reduced systematicity does not\nalways decrease it (see Lee and Holyoak 2008). The more general point\nis that systematicity can be misleading, unless we take into account\nthe nature of the relationships between various factors and\nthe hypothetical analogy. Systematicity does not magically produce or\nexplain the plausibility of an analogical argument. When we reason by\nanalogy, we must determine which features of both domains are relevant\nand how they relate to the analogical conclusion. There is no\nshort-cut via syntax.\n\nSchlimm (2008) offers an entirely different critique of the\nstructure-mapping theory from the perspective of analogical reasoning\nin mathematics\u2014a domain where one might expect a formal approach\nsuch as structure mapping to perform well. Schlimm introduces\na simple distinction: a domain is object-rich if the number\nof objects is greater than the number of relations (and properties),\nand relation-rich otherwise. Proponents of the\nstructure-mapping theory typically focus on relation-rich examples\n(such as the analogy between the solar system and the atom). By\ncontrast, analogies in mathematics typically involve domains with an\nenormous number of objects (like the real numbers), but relatively few\nrelations and functions (addition, multiplication, less-than).\n\nSchlimm provides an example of an analogical reasoning problem in\ngroup theory that involves a single relation in each domain. In this\ncase, attaining maximal systematicity is trivial. The difficulty is\nthat, compatible with maximal systematicity, there are different ways\nin which the objects might be placed in correspondence. The\nstructure-mapping theory appears to yield the wrong inference. We\nmight put the general point as follows: in object-rich domains,\nsystematicity ceases to be a reliable guide to plausible analogical\ninference.\n",
