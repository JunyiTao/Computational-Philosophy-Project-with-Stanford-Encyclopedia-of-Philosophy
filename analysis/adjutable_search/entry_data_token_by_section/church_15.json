    "main_text": "Paradox || Antinomy in Church\u2019s Work\n4.1 Antinomy in Church\u2019s Work\n\nChurch\u2019s work was dogged by what he termed\n\u201cantinomies\u201d, which he distinguished from paradoxes in\nthat the former result in outright contradiction whereas the latter\ngive rise only to unacceptable conclusions. (Quine\u2019s paradox\ndiscussed in\n supplement C\n is an example of a paradox that is not an antinomy.) His early\nattempt at providing foundations for mathematics turned out to be\nsusceptible to Russell\u2019s antinomy (Church 1932) and\nRichard\u2019s antinomy (Church 1933). (Hereafter we use\n\u201cparadox\u201d rather than \u201cantinomy\u201d since that is\nthe current usage; but bear in mind that there are then two kinds of\nparadox.) His later attempts to formulate LSD gave rise to the\nRussell-Myhill paradox and Anderson\u2019s (1987) paradox, which\ndrove Church to turn to Ramified Type Theory (or \u201cRTT\u201d) as\na solution (see below\n \u00a74.4\n and\n \u00a75).\n In addition Church was convinced that Simple Type Theory (or\n\u201cSTT\u201d, see\n supplement D)\n supplemented with a semantical predicate is threatened by the\nsemantical paradoxes and in particular by the Grelling-Nelson paradox\n(the \u201cheterological\u201d paradox), hereafter\n\u201cGrelling\u2019s paradox\u201d or GP. Church had an intense\ndesire to show first how GP may be derived in STT so supplemented,\nsecondly, how RTT resolves the problem, third, that adding the axioms\nof reducibility does not restore the paradox and in fact leads to an\nimportant definability result concerning RTT with reducibility, and\nfinally, fourth, that the resolution of GP by means of RTT does not\ndiffer significantly from a Tarskian resolution in terms of the\ndistinction between object and metalanguage.\n",
