    "main_text": "The Subject Matter of Linguistic Theories || The faculty of language in narrow and broad senses\n2.3 The faculty of language in narrow and broad senses\n\nIn Hauser et al. (2002) (henceforth HCF) a further pair of contrasting\nterms is introduced. They draw a distinction quite separate from the\ncompetence/performance and\n\u2018I-language\u2019/\u2018E-language\u2019 distinctions: the\n\u201clanguage faculty in the narrow sense\u201d (FLN) is\ndistinguished from the \u201clanguage faculty in the broad\nsense\u201d (FLB). According to HCF, FLB \u201cexcludes other\norganism-internal systems that are necessary but not sufficient for\nlanguage (e.g., memory, respiration, digestion, circulation,\netc.)\u201d but includes whatever is involved in language, and FLN is\nsome limited part of FLB (p. 1571) This is all fairly vague, but it is\nclear that FLN and FLB are both internal rather than external, and\nindividual rather than social.\n\nThe FLN/FLB distinction apparently aims to address the uniqueness of\none component of the human capacity for language rather than (say) the\ncontent of human grammars. HCF say (p. 1573) that \u201cOnly FLN is\nuniquely human\u201d; they \u201chypothesize that most, if not all,\nof FLB is based on mechanisms shared with nonhuman animals\u201d; and\nthey say:\n\n[T]he computations underlying FLN may be quite limited. In fact, we\npropose in this hypothesis that FLN comprises only the core\ncomputational mechanisms of recursion as they appear in narrow syntax\nand the mappings to the interfaces. (ibid.)\n\n\nThe components of FLB that HCF hypothesize are not part of FLN are the\n\u201csensory-motor\u201d and \u201cconceptual-intentional\u201d\nsystems. The study of the conceptual-intentional system includes\ninvestigations of things like the theory of mind; referential vocal\nsignals; whether imitation is goal directed; and the field of\npragmatics. The study of the sensory motor system, by contrast,\nincludes \u201cvocal tract length and formant dispersion in birds and\nprimates\u201d; learning of songs by songbirds; analyses of vocal\ndialects in whales and spontaneous imitation of artificially created\nsounds in dolphins; \u201cprimate vocal production, including the\nrole of mandibular oscillations\u201d; and \u201c[c]ross-modal\nperception and sign language in humans versus unimodal communication\nin animals\u201d.\n\nIt is presented as an empirical hypothesis that a core property of the\nFLN is \u201crecursion\u201d:\n\nAll approaches agree that a core property of FLN is recursion,\nattributed to narrow syntax\u2026FLN takes a finite set of elements\nand yields a potentially infinite array of discrete expressions. This\ncapacity of FLN yields discrete infinity (a property that also\ncharacterizes the natural numbers). (HCF, p. 1571)\n\n\nHCF leave open exactly what the FLN includes in addition to recursion.\nIt is not ruled out that the FLN incorporates substantive universals\nas well as the formal property of \u201crecursion\u201d. But\nwhatever \u201crecursion\u201d is in this context, it is apparently\nnot domain-specific in the sense of earlier discussions by generative\nEssentialists, because it is not unique to human natural language or\ndefined over specifically linguistic inputs and outputs: it is the\nbasis for humans\u2019 grasp of the formal and arguably non-natural\nlanguage of arithmetic (counting, and the successor function), and\nperhaps also navigation and social relations. It might be more\nappropriate to say that HCF identify recursion as a cognitive\nuniversal, not a linguistic one. And in that case it is difficult to\nsee how the so-called \u2018language faculty\u2019 deserves that\nname: it is more like a faculty for cognition and communication.\n\nThis abandonment of linguistic domain-specificity contrasts very\nsharply with the picture that was such a prominent characteristic of\nthe earlier work on linguistic nativism, popularized in different ways\nby Fodor (1983), Barkow et al. (1992), and Pinker (1994). And yet the\nHCF discussion of FLN seems to incline to the view that human language\ncapacities have a unique human (though not uniquely linguistic)\nessence.\n\nThe FLN/FLB distinction provides earlier generative Essentialism with\nan answer (at least in part) to the question of what the singularity\nof the human language faculty consists in, and it does so in a way\nthat subsumes many of the empirical discoveries of paleoanthropology,\nprimatology, and ethnography that have been part of highly influential\nin Emergentist approaches as well as neo-Darwinian Essentialist\napproaches. A neo-Darwinian Essentialist like Pinker will accept that\nthe language faculty involves recursion, but also will also hold (with\nEmergentists) that human language capacities originated, via natural\nselection, for the purpose of linguistic communication.\n\nThus, over the years, those Essentialists who follow Chomsky closely\nhave changed the term they use for their core subject matter from\n\u2018linguistic competence\u2019 to \u2018I-language\u2019 to\n\u2018FLN\u2019, and the concepts expressed by these terms are all\nslightly different. In particular, what they are counterposed to\ndiffers in each case.\n\nThe challenge for the generative Essentialist adopting the FLN/FLB\ndistinction as characterized by HCF is to identify empirical data that\ncan support the hypothesis that the FLN \u201cyields discrete\ninfinity\u201d. That will mean answering the question: discrete\ninfinity of what? HCF write that FLN \u201ctakes a finite set of\nelements and yields a potentially infinite array of discrete\nexpressions\u201d (p. 1571), which makes it clear that there must be\na recursive procedure in the mathematical sense, perhaps putting\natomic elements such as words together to make internally complex\nelements like sentences (\u201carray\u201d should probably be\nunderstood as a misnomer for \u2018set\u2019). But then they say,\nsomewhat mystifyingly:\n\nEach of these discrete expressions is then passed to the sensory-motor\nand conceptual-intentional systems, which process and elaborate this\ninformation in the use of language. Each expression is, in this sense,\na pairing of sound and meaning. (HCF, p. 1571)\n\n\nBut the sensory-motor and conceptual-intentional systems are concrete\nparts of the organism: muscles and nerves and articulatory organs and\nperceptual channels and neuronal activity. How can each one of a\n\u201cpotentially infinite array\u201d be \u201cpassed to\u201d\nsuch concrete systems without it taking a potentially infinite amount\nof time? HCF may mean that for any one of the expressions that FLN\ndefines as well-formed (by generating it) there is a possibility of\nits being used as the basis for a pairing of sound and meaning. This\nwould be closer to the classical generative Essentialist view that the\ngrammar generates an infinite set of structural descriptions; but it\nis not what HCF say.\n\nAt root, HCF is a polemical work intended to identify the view it\npromotes as valuable and all other approaches to linguistics as\notiose.\n\nIn the varieties of modern linguistics that concern us here, the term\n\u201clanguage\u201d is used quite differently to refer to an\ninternal component of the mind/brain (sometimes called internal\nlanguage or I-language).\u2026 However, this biologically and\nindividually grounded usage still leaves much open to interpretation\n(and misunderstanding). For example, a neuroscientist might ask: What\ncomponents of the human nervous system are recruited in the use of\nlanguage in its broadest sense? Because any aspect of cognition\nappears to be, at least in principle, accessible to language, the\nbroadest answer to this question is, probably, \u201cmost of\nit.\u201d Even aspects of emotion or cognition not readily verbalized\nmay be influenced by linguistically based thought processes. Thus,\nthis conception is too broad to be of much use. (HCF, p. 1570)\n\n\nIt is hard to see this as anything other than a claim that approaches\nto linguistics focusing on anything that could fall under the label\n\u2018E-language\u2019 are to be dismissed as useless.\n\nSome Externalists and Emergentists actually reject the idea that the\nhuman capacity for language yields \u201ca potentially infinite array\nof expressions\u201d. It is often pointed out by empirically inclined\ncomputational linguists that in practice there will only ever be a\nfinite number of sentences to be dealt with (though the people saying\nthis may underestimate the sheer vastness of the finite set involved).\nAnd naturally, for those who do not believe there are generative\ngrammars in speakers\u2019 heads at all, it holds a fortiori that\nspeakers do not have grammars in their heads generating infinite\nlanguages (see Nefdt 2019c for a scientific modeling perspective on\nthe infinity postulate). Externalists and Emergentists tend to hold\nthat the \u201cdiscrete infinity\u201d that HCF posits is more\nplausibly a property of the generative Essentialists\u2019 model of\nlinguistic competence, I-language, or FLN, than a part of the human\nmind/brain. This does not mean that non-Essentialists deny that actual\nlanguage use is creative, or (of course) that they think there is a\nlongest sentence of English. But they may reject the link between\nlinguistic productivity or creativity and the mathematical notion of\nrecursion (see Pullum and Scholz 2010).\n\nHCF\u2019s remarks about how FLN \u201cyields\u201d or\n\u201cgenerates\u201d a specific \u201carray\u201d assume that\nlanguages are clearly and sharply individuated by their generators.\nThey appear to be committed to the view that there is a fact of the\nmatter about exactly which generator is in a given speaker\u2019s\nhead. Emergentists tend not to individuate languages in this way, and\nmay reject generative grammars entirely as inappropriately or\nunacceptably \u2018formalist\u2019. They are content with the notion\nthat the common-sense concept of a language is vague, and it is not\nthe job of linguistic theory to explain what a language is, any more\nthan it is the job of physicists to explain what material is, or of\nbiologists to explain what life is. Emergentists, in particular, are\ninterested not so much in identifying generators, or individuating\nlanguages, but in exploring the component capacities that facilitate\nlinguistic communication, and finding out how they interact.\n\nSimilarly, Externalists are interested in the linguistic structure of\nexpressions, but have little use for the idea of a discrete infinity\nof them, a view that is not, and cannot be empirically supported,\nunless one thinks of simplicity and elegance of theory as empirical\nmatters. They focus on the outward manifestations of language, not on\na set of expressions regarded as a whole language\u2014at least not\nin any way that would give a language a definite cardinality. Zellig\nHarris, an archetypal Externalist, is explicit that the reason for not\nregarding the set of utterances as finite concerns the elegance of the\nresulting grammar: \u201cIf we were to insist on a finite language,\nwe would have to include in our grammar several highly arbitrary and\nnumerical conditions\u201d (Harris 1957: 208). Infinitude, on his\nview is an unimportant side consequence of setting up a\nsentence-generating grammar in an uncluttered and maximally elegant\nway, not a discovered property of languages (see Pullum and Scholz\n2010 for further discussion).\n",
