    "main_text": "The Beautiful: Aesthetics in the Enlightenment || Empiricism and Subjectivism\n3.2 Empiricism and Subjectivism\n\nThough philosophical rationalism forms the basis of aesthetics in the\nearly Enlightenment in France and Germany, thinkers in the empiricist\ntradition in England and Scotland introduce many of the salient themes\nof Enlightenment aesthetics. In particular, with the rise of\nempiricism and subjectivism in this domain, attention shifts to the\nground and nature of the subject\u2019s experience of beauty, the\nsubject\u2019s aesthetic response. Lord Shaftesbury, though not\nhimself an empiricist or subjectivist in aesthetics, makes significant\ncontributions to this development. Shaftesbury re-iterates the\nclassical equation, \u201call beauty is truth,\u201d but the truth\nthat beauty is for Shaftesbury is not an objective rational order that\ncould also be known conceptually. Though beauty is, for Shaftesbury, a\nkind of harmony that is independent of the human mind, under the\ninfluence of Plotinus, he understands the human being\u2019s\nimmediate intuition of the beautiful as a kind of participation in the\noriginal harmony. Shaftesbury focuses attention on the nature of the\nsubject\u2019s response to beauty, as elevating the person, also\nmorally. He maintains that aesthetic response consists in a\ndisinterested unegoistic pleasure; the discovery of this\ncapacity for disinterested pleasure in harmony shows the way for the\ndevelopment of his ethics that has a similar grounding. And, in fact,\nin seeing aesthetic response as elevating oneself above\nself-interested pursuits, through cultivating one\u2019s receptivity\nto disinterested pleasure, Shaftesbury ties tightly together\naesthetics and ethics, morality and beauty, and in that respect also\ncontributes to a trend of the period. Also, in placing the emphasis on\nthe subject\u2019s response to beauty, rather than on the objective\ncharacteristics of the beautiful, Shaftesbury makes aesthetics belong\nto the general Enlightenment interest in human nature. Thinkers of the\nperiod find in our receptivity to beauty a key both to understanding\nboth distinctively human nature and its perfection.\n\nFrancis Hutcheson follows Shaftesbury in his emphasis on the\nsubject\u2019s aesthetic response, on the distinctive sort of\npleasure that the beautiful elicits in us. Partly because the\nNeo-Platonic influence, so pronounced in Shaftesbury\u2019s\naesthetics, is washed out of Hutcheson\u2019s, to be replaced by a\nmore thorough-going empiricism, Hutcheson understands this distinctive\naesthetic pleasure as more akin to a secondary quality. Thus,\nHutcheson\u2019s aesthetic work raises the prominent question whether\n\u201cbeauty\u201d refers to something objective at all or whether\nbeauty is \u201cnothing more\u201d than a human idea or experience.\nAs in the domain of Enlightenment ethics, so with Enlightenment\naesthetics too, the step from Shaftesbury to Hutcheson marks a step\ntoward subjectivism. Hutcheson writes in one of his Two\nTreatises, his Inquiry Concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony,\nDesign (1725) that \u201cthe word \u2018beauty\u2019 is taken\nfor the idea raised in us, and a sense of beauty for\nour power of receiving this idea\u201d (Section I, Article\nIX). However, though Hutcheson understands beauty to be an idea in us,\nhe takes this idea to be \u201cexcited\u201d or\n\u201coccasioned\u201d in us by distinctive objective qualities, in\nparticular by objects that display \u201cuniformity amidst\nvariety\u201d (ibid., Section II, Article III). In the very\ntitle of Hutcheson\u2019s work above, we see the importance of the\nclassical ideas of (rational) order and harmony in Hutcheson\u2019s\naesthetic theory, even as he sets the tenor for much Enlightenment\ndiscussion of aesthetics through placing the emphasis on the\nsubjective idea and aesthetic response.\n\nDavid Hume\u2019s famous essay on \u201cthe standard of taste\u201d\nraises and addresses the epistemological problem raised by\nsubjectivism in aesthetics. If beauty is an idea in us, rather than a\nfeature of objects independent of us, then how do we understand the\npossibility of correctness and incorrectness \u2013 how do we\nunderstand the possibility of standards of judgment \u2013 in this\ndomain? The problem is posed more clearly for Hume because he\nintensifies Hutcheson\u2019s subjectivism. He writes in the\nTreatise that \u201cpleasure and pain\u2026.are not only\nnecessary attendants of beauty and deformity, but constitute their\nvery essence\u201d (Treatise, Book II, part I, section\nviii). But if a judgment of taste is based on, or expresses,\nsubjective sentiments, how can it be incorrect? In his response to\nthis question, Hume accounts for the expectation of agreement in\njudgments of taste by appealing to the fact that we share a common\nhuman nature, and he accounts for \u2018objectivity\u2019 or\nexpertise in judgments of taste, within the context of his\nsubjectivism, by appealing to the normative responses of well-placed\nobservers. Both of these points (the commonality of human nature and\nthe securing of \u2018objectivity\u2019 in judgments based on\nsentiments by appeal to the normative responses of appropriately\nplaced observers) are typical of the period more generally, and\nespecially of the strong empiricist strain in the Enlightenment. Hume\ndevelops the empiricist line in aesthetics to the point where little\nremains of the classical emphasis on the order or harmony or truth\nthat is, according to the French classicists, apprehended and\nappreciated in our aesthetic responses to the beautiful, and thus,\naccording to the classicists, the ground of aesthetic responses.\n",
