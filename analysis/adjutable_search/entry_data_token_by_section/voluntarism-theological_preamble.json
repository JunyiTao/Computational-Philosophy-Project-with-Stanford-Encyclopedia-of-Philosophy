    "main_text": "\n\nThere is a class of metaethical and normative views that commonly goes\nby the name \u2018divine command theory.\u2019 What all members of\nthis class have in common is that they hold that what God wills is\nrelevant to determining the moral status of some set of entities\n(acts, states of affairs, character traits, etc., or some combination\nof these). But the name \u2018divine command theory\u2019 is a bit\nmisleading: what these views have in common is their appeal to the\ndivine will; while many of these views hold that the relevant act of\ndivine will is that of commanding, some deny it. So we would do well\nto have a label for this class of views that does not prejudge the\nissue of the relevant act of divine will. The label that I will use,\nfollowing Quinn 1990, is \u2018theological voluntarism.\u2019\n\nI have three aims in this article. I want first to distinguish\nmetaethical versions of theological voluntarism from normative\nversions of that view, putting to the side normative versions. Second,\nI will say something about the main lines of defense of theological\nvoluntarism, the various theoretical options that confront defenders\nof theological voluntarism, and some of the reasons for affirming or\nrejecting these different possible formulations. And finally I will\nsay a bit about the sort of difficulties that seem to confront any\nsuch views. (I do not, however, give an account of the history of\ntheological voluntarism in moral philosophy; for an anthology of\nreadings covering a broad swath of this history, see Idziak 1979.)\n",
