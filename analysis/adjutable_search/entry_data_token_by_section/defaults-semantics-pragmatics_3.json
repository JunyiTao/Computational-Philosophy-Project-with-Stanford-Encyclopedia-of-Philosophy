    "main_text": "Default Interpretations in Semantics and Pragmatics || Rhetorical Structure Rules\n1.4 Rhetorical Structure Rules\n\nGricean pragmatics is not the only approach in which defaults are\ndiscussed. Defaults and nonmonotonic reasoning are also well\nentrenched in\n computational linguistics.\n Defaults are distinguished there with respect to various units of\nmeaning, from morphemes and words to multisentential units (Asher\n& Lascarides 1995; Lascarides & Copestake 1998). In this\nsection I focus on intersentential default links and in the next I\nplace \u2018glue logic\u2019 in the context of some other\nunderstandings of defaults in computational semantics.\n\nThe tradition of defaults in nonmonotonic reasoning can be traced back\nto Humboldt, Jespersen and Cassirer, and more recently to\nReiter\u2019s (1980) default logic and his default rules of the\nform:\n\nA:B\n\nC\n\nwhere C can be concluded if A has been concluded and\nB can be assumed (and not B cannot be proven). Such\ndefaults can be built into standard logic:\n\nIt is just as valid to conclude \u2018Presumably x is\nB\u2019 from \u2018x is A\u2019 and\n\u2018A\u2019s are normally B\u2019 as it is to\nconclude \u2018x is B\u2019 from \u2018x\nis A\u2019 and the \u2018All A\u2019s are\nB\u2019. One does not have to set one\u2019s mind to a\ndifferent mode of reasoning to get the former. Veltman (1996: 257).\n\n\nBut the resulting logic will become nonmonotonic because there are\ndefault rules and default operators in the language. The literature on\nthe topic is vast and is best considered as a separate topic from our\ncurrent concern (see e.g., Thomason (1997) for an overview).\n\nA good example of how default interpretations can be accounted for in\nformal semantic theory is Segmented Discourse Representation Theory\n(SDRT, e.g., Asher & Lascarides 2003). SDRT is an offshoot of\nDiscourse Representation Theory, a dynamic semantic approach to\nmeaning according to which meaning arises incrementally through\ncontext change. In SDRT, defaults are regarded as highly probable\nroutes that an interpretation of a sentence may take in a particular\nsituation of discourse. There are rules of discourse, so-called\nrhetorical structure rules, that produce such default\ninterpretations. These rules spell out the overall assumption that\ndiscourse is coherent and that this coherence can be further\nelaborated on by proposing a set of regularities. For example, two\nevents represented as two consecutive utterances are presumed to stand\nin the relation of Narration, where the event described in\nthe first utterance precedes the one from the second utterance. If the\nsecond utterance describes a state, then it stands in the relation of\nBackground to the first one. There are many other types of\nsuch relations, among them Explanation and Elaboration. Axioms prevent\na relation from being of two incompatible types at the same time. The\nrelations between states and events are computed as strong\nprobabilities, in the process called defeasible reasoning. The laws of\nreasoning are \u2018defeasible\u2019 in the sense that if the\nantecedent of a default rule is satisfied, then its consequent is\nnormally, but not always, satisfied. The inference normally,\nbut not always, obtains: ceteris paribus, the relation\npredicted by the law obtains, but in certain circumstances it may not.\nIt is also nonmonotonic in that the relation may disappear with the\ngrowth of information.\n\nSDRT includes the following components: (i) the semantics of sentences\nalone, that is the underspecified output of the syntactic processing\nof the sentences; (ii) the semantics of information content, that is,\nfurther addition to these underdetermined meanings, including default\nadditions summarised by rhetorical structure rules; and (iii) the\nsemantics of information packaging that \u2018glues\u2019 such\nenriched representations by means of the rules of the rhetorical\nstructure of discourse. This \u2018gluing together\u2019 is\ndefeasible, in that the rules result in the dependency\nA>B, that is \u2018if A, then normally\nB\u2019, where A and B stand for the\nenriched propositional representations of two sentences. In other\nwords, they stand for the meanings of two consecutive utterances.\n\nThe main strength of this approach is that it is fully formalized and\nit allows for computational modelling of discourse that takes\npragmatic links between utterances seriously and incorporates them in\nthe semantics. Next, it also aspires to cognitive reality and although\nthe cognitive reality of the particular rules can be disputed, the\nview of discourse processing that they jointly produce is highly\nplausible. Finally, as the authors often stress, SDRT allows them, for\nmost part, to model discourse without recourse to speakers\u2019\nintentions. However, a direct comparison with Gricean accounts of\ndefaults is precluded by the fact that we would not be comparing like\nwith like. In SDRT, the default interpretations are the defaults that\nare formalized with respect to the actually occurring discourse: there\nare rules that tell us how to take two events represented in two\nconsecutive sentences, there are also rules that specify the relation\nbetween them depending on some features of their content. Gricean\ndefaults are, on the contrary, defaults for speakers\u2019 overall\nknowledge state: they may arise because the speaker did not\nsay something he or she could have said or because the\nspeaker assumed some cultural or social information to be shared\nknowledge. For example, we cannot formalize the interpretation of (9a)\nas (9b) by means of rhetorical structure rules. The interpretation of\n(9a) as (9b) fits under the SDRT component (ii) rather than (iii)\nabove, i.e., the semantics of information content rather than\npackaging.\n\n(9a)Pablo\u2019s painting is of a crying woman.\n(9b)Picasso\u2019s painting is of a crying woman.\n\nFinally, it has to be mentioned that the discourse relations that for\nAsher and Lascarides belong to the \u2018glue logic\u2019 can\nalternatively be conceived of as part of the grammar proper: Lepore\n& Stone (2015), for example, incorporate conventions into\nminimalistically understood, grammar-driven semantics, and a fortiori\ninto grammar proper; following Lewis\u2019s (1979) ideas on\nconvention and \u2018scorekeeping\u2019, they propose that\n\u201csemantics describes interlocutors\u2019 social competence in\ncoordinating on the conversational record\u201d (Lepore & Stone\n2015: 256). Merits of putting conventions into grammar are, however,\nnot easy to find (for a review see Jaszczolt 2016b).\n",
