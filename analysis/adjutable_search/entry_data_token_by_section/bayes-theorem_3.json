    "main_text": "The Role of Bayes' Theorem in Subjectivist Accounts of Evidence\n4. The Role of Bayes' Theorem in Subjectivist Models of Learning\n\n\nSubjectivists think of learning as a process of belief\nrevision in which a \"prior\" subjective probability P is\nreplaced by a \"posterior\" probability Q that incorporates newly\nacquired information.  This process proceeds in two stages. First,\nsome of the subject's probabilities are directly altered by\nexperience, intuition, memory, or some other non-inferential\nlearning process. Second, the subject \"updates\" the rest of her\nopinions to bring them into line with her newly acquired knowledge.\n\n Many subjectivists are content to regard the initial belief changes\nas sui generis and independent of the believer's prior state\nof opinion.  However, as long as the first phase of the learning\nprocess is understood to be non-inferential, subjectivism can be made\ncompatible with an \"externalist\" epistemology that allows for\ncriticism of belief changes in terms the reliability of the causal\nprocesses that generate them. It can even accommodate the thought that\nthe direct effect of experience might depend causally on the\nbeliever's prior probability.\n\n Subjectivists have studied the second, inferential phase of the\nlearning process in great detail. Here immediate belief changes are\nseen as imposing constraints of the form \"the posterior probability\nQ has such-and-such properties.\" The objective is to discover\nwhat sorts of constraints experience tends to impose, and to explain\nhow the person's prior opinions can be used to justify the\nchoice of a posterior probability from among the many that might\nsatisfy a given constraint. Subjectivists approach the latter problem\nby assuming that the agent is justified in adopting whatever eligible\nposterior departs minimally from her prior opinions. This is\na kind of \"no jumping to conclusions\" requirement. We explain it here\nas a natural result of the idea that rational learners should\nproportion their beliefs to the strength of the evidence they acquire.\n\n The simplest learning experiences are those in which the learner\nbecomes certain of the truth of some proposition E about\nwhich she was previously uncertain. Here the constraint is that all\nhypotheses inconsistent with E must be assigned probability\nzero. Subjectivists model this sort of learning as simple\nconditioning, the process in which the prior probability of each\nproposition H is replaced by a posterior that coincides with\nthe prior probability of H conditional on E.\n\n\n\n(3.1)\nSimple Conditioning\n\n\n \nIf a person with a \"prior\" such that 0 < P(E) < 1\nhas a learning experience whose sole immediate effect is to raise her\nsubjective probability for E to 1, then her post-learning\n\"posterior\" for any proposition H should be\nQ(H) = PE(H).\n\n\n\n\n In short, a rational believer who learns for certain that E\nis true should factor this information into her doxastic system by\nconditioning on it.\n\n Though useful as an ideal, simple conditioning is not widely\napplicable because it requires the learner to become absolutely\ncertain of E's truth. As Richard Jeffrey has argued\n(Jeffrey 1987), the evidence we receive is often too vague or\nambiguous to justify such \"dogmatism.\"  On more realistic models, the\ndirect effect of a learning experience will be to alter the\nsubjective probability of some proposition without raising it to 1 or\nlowering it to 0. Experiences of this sort are appropriately modeled\nby what has come to be called Jeffrey conditioning (though\nJeffrey's preferred term is \"probability kinematics\").\n\n\n\n(3.2)\nJeffrey Conditioning\n\n\n \nIf a person with a prior such that 0 < P(E) < 1\nhas a learning experience whose sole immediate effect is to change her\nsubjective probability for E to q, then her\npost-learning posterior for any H should be\nQ(H) =\nqPE(H) + (1 \u2212\nq)P~E(H).\n\n\n\n\n Obviously, Jeffrey conditioning reduces to simple conditioning when\nq = 1.\n\n A variety of arguments for conditioning (simple or Jeffrey-style) can\nbe found in the literature, but we cannot consider them\n here.[16]\n There is, however, one sort of justification in which Bayes' Theorem\nfigures prominently. It exploits connections between belief revision\nand the notion of incremental evidence to show that conditioning is\nthe only belief revision rule that allows learners to\ncorrectly proportion their posterior beliefs to the new evidence they\nreceive.\n\n The key to the argument lies in marrying the \"minimal\" version of\nBayesian expressed in the (2.1e) to a very modest \"proportioning\"\nrequirement for belief revision rules.\n\n\n\n(3.3)\nThe Weak Evidence Principle\n\n\n \n If, relative to a prior P, E provides at least\nas much incremental evidence for H as for H*, and if\nH is antecedently more probable than H*, then\nH should remain more probable than H* after any\nlearning experience whose sole immediate effect is to increase the\nprobability of E.\n\n\n\n\n This requires an agent to retain his views about the relative\nprobability of two hypotheses when he acquires evidence that supports\nthe more probable hypothesis more strongly. It rules out obviously\nirrational belief revisions such as this: George is more confident\nthat the New York Yankees will win the American League Pennant than he\nis that the Boston Rex Sox will win it, but he reverses himself when\nhe learns (only) that the Yankees beat the Red Sox in last night's\ngame.\n\n Combining (3.3) with minimal Bayesianism yields the following:\n\n\n\n(3.4)\nConsequence\n\n\n \nIf a person's prior is such that LR(H,\nH*; E) \u2265 1, LR(~H,\n~H*; ~E) \u2265 1, and P(H) >\nP(H*), then any learning experience whose sole\nimmediate effect is to raise her subjective probability for E\nshould result in a posterior such that Q(H) >\nQ(H*).\n\n\n\n\n On the reasonable assumption that Q is defined on the same set\nof propositions over which P is defined, this condition\nsuffices to pick out simple conditioning as the unique\ncorrect method of belief revision for learning experiences that make\nE certain.  It picks out Jeffrey conditioning as the\nunique correct method when learning merely alters one's\nsubjective probability for E.  The argument for these\nconclusions makes use of the following two facts about probabilities.\n\n\n\n(3.5)\nLemma\n\n\n \nIf H and H* both entail E when\nP(H) > P(H*), then\nLR(H, H*; E) = 1 and\nLR(~H, ~H*; ~E) >\n1.\n\n\n\nProof Sketch\n\n\n\n\n(3.6)\nLemma\n\n\n \nSimple conditioning on E is the only rule for revising\nsubjective probabilities that yields a posterior with the following\nproperties for any prior such that P(E) >\n0:\n\nQ(E) = 1.\nOrdinal Similarity.  If H and H* both\nentail E, then P(H) \u2265\nP(H*) if and only if Q(H) \u2265\nQ(H*).\n\n\n\n\n\nProof Sketch\n\n\n\n\n From here the argument for simple conditioning is a matter of using\n(3.4) and (3.5) to establish ordinal similarity.  Suppose that\nH and H* entail E and that\nP(H) > P(H*).  It follows from\n(3.5) that LR(H, H*; E) = 1\nand LR(~H, ~H*; ~E) >\n1. (3.4) then entails that any learning experience that raises\nE's probability must result in a posterior with\nQ(H) > Q(H*).  Thus, Q and\nP are ordinally similar with respect to hypotheses that entail\nH.  If we go on to suppose that the learning experience\nraises E's probability to 1, then (3.6) then guarantees that\nQ arises from P by simple conditioning on E.\n\n The case for Jeffrey conditioning is similarly direct.  Since the\nargument for ordinal similarity did not depend at all on the\nassumption that Q(E) = 1, we have really established\n\n\n\n(3.7)\nCorollary\n\n\n \n\u2022 If H and H* entail E, then\nP(H) > P(H*) if and only if\nQ(H) > Q(H*).\n\n\n\n\u2022 If H and H* entail ~E, then\nP(H) > P(H*) if and only if\nQ(H) > Q(H*).\n\n\n\n\n So, Q is ordinally similar to P both when restricted to\nhypotheses that entail E and when restricted to hypotheses\nthan entail ~E. Moreover, since dividing by positive numbers\ndoes not disturb ordinal relationships, it also follows that that\nQE is ordinally similar to P when\nrestricted to hypotheses that entail E, and that\nQ~E is ordinally similar to P when\nrestricted to hypotheses than entail ~E. Since\nQE(E) = 1 =\nQ~E(E), (3.6) then entails:\n\n\n\n(3.8)\nConsequence\n\n\n \n\n For every proposition H,\nQE(H) =\nPE(H) and\nQ~E(H) =\nP~E(H)\n \n\n\n\n\n It is easy to show that (3.8) is necessary and sufficient for\nQ to arise from P by Jeffrey conditioning on E.\nSubject to the constraint Q(E) = q, it\nguarantees that Q(H) =\nqPE(H) + (1\n\u2212q)P~E(H).\n\n The general moral is clear.\n\nThe basic Bayesian insight embodied in the weak likelihood\nprinciple (2.1e) entails that simple and Jeffrey conditioning on\nE are the only rational ways to revise beliefs in\nresponse to a learning experience whose sole immediate effect is to\nalter E's probability.\n\n\n While much more can be said about simple conditioning, Jeffrey\nconditioning and other forms of belief revision, these remarks should\ngive the reader a sense of the importance of Bayes' Theorem in\nsubjectivist accounts of learning and evidential support. Though a\nmathematical triviality, the Theorem's central insight \u2014 that a\nhypothesis is supported by any body of data it renders probable \u2014 lies at the heart of all subjectivist approaches to epistemology, statistics, and inductive logic.\n",
