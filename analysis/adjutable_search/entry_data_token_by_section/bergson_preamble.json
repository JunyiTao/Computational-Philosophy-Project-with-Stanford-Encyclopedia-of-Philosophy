    "main_text": "\n\nHenri Bergson (1859\u20131941) was one of the most famous and\ninfluential French philosophers of the late 19th century-early 20th\ncentury. Although his international fame reached cult-like heights\nduring his lifetime, his influence decreased notably after the second\nWorld War. While such French thinkers as Merleau-Ponty, Sartre, and\nL\u00e9vinas explicitly acknowledged his influence on their thought,\nit is generally agreed that it was Gilles Deleuze\u2019s 1966\nBergsonism that marked the reawakening of interest in\nBergson\u2019s work. Deleuze realized that Bergson\u2019s most\nenduring contribution to philosophical thinking is his concept of\nmultiplicity. Bergson\u2019s concept of multiplicity attempts to\nunify in a consistent way two contradictory features: heterogeneity\nand continuity. Many philosophers today think that this concept of\nmultiplicity, despite its difficulty, is revolutionary. It is\nrevolutionary because it opens the way to a reconception of\ncommunity.\n",
