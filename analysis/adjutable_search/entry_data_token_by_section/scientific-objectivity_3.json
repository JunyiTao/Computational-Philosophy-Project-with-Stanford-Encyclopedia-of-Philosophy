    "main_text": "Objectivity as Faithfulness to Facts || Theory-Ladenness and Incommensurability\n2.2 Theory-Ladenness and Incommensurability\n\nAccording to a popular picture, all scientific theories are false and\nimperfect. Yet, as we add true and eliminate false beliefs, our best\nscientific theories become more truthlike (e.g., Popper 1963,\n1972). If this picture is correct, then scientific knowledge grows by\ngradually approaching the truth and it will become more objective over\ntime, that is, more faithful to facts. However, scientific theories\noften change, and sometimes several theories compete for the place of\nthe best scientific account of the world.\n\nIt is inherent in the above picture of scientific objectivity that\nobservations can, at least in principle, decide between competing\ntheories. If they did not, the conception of objectivity as\nfaithfulness would be pointless to have as we would not be in a\nposition to verify it. This position has been adopted by Karl R.\nPopper, Rudolf Carnap and other leading figures in (broadly)\nempiricist philosophy of science. Many philosophers have argued that\nthe relation between observation and theory is way more complex and\nthat influences can actually run both ways (e.g., Duhem 1906 [1954];\nWittgenstein 1953 [2001]). The most lasting criticism, however, was\ndelivered by Thomas S. Kuhn (1962 [1970]) in his book \u201cThe\nStructure of Scientific Revolutions\u201d.\n\nKuhn\u2019s analysis is built on the assumption that scientists\nalways view research problems through the lens of a paradigm, defined\nby set of relevant problems, axioms, methodological presuppositions,\ntechniques, and so forth. Kuhn provided several historical examples in\nfavor of this claim. Scientific progress\u2014and the practice of\nnormal, everyday science\u2014happens within a paradigm that guides\nthe individual scientists\u2019 puzzle-solving work and that sets the\ncommunity standards.\n\nCan observations undermine such a paradigm, and speak for a different\none? Here, Kuhn famously stresses that observations are\n\u201ctheory-laden\u201d (cf. also Hanson 1958): they\ndepend on a body of theoretical assumptions through which they are\nperceived and conceptualized. This hypothesis has two important\naspects.\n\nFirst, the meaning of observational concepts is influenced by\ntheoretical assumptions and presuppositions. For example, the concepts\n\u201cmass\u201d and \u201clength\u201d have different meanings in\nNewtonian and relativistic mechanics; so does the concept\n\u201ctemperature\u201d in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics\n(cf. Feyerabend 1962). In other words, Kuhn denies that there is a\ntheory-independent observation language. The \u201cfaithfulness to\nreality\u201d of an observation report is always mediated by a\ntheoretical \u00fcberbau, disabling the role of observation\nreports as an impartial, merely fact-dependent arbiter between\ndifferent theories.\n\nSecond, not only the observational concepts, but also the\nperception of a scientist depends on the paradigm she is\nworking in.\n\n\nPracticing in different worlds, the two groups of scientists [who work\nin different paradigms, J.R./J.S.] see different things when they look\nfrom the same point in the same direction. (Kuhn 1962 [1970: 150])\n\n\nThat is, our own sense data are shaped and structured by a theoretical\nframework, and may be fundamentally distinct from the sense data of\nscientists working in another one. Where a Ptolemaic astronomer like\nTycho Brahe sees a sun setting behind the horizon, a Copernican\nastronomer like Johannes Kepler sees the horizon moving up to a\nstationary sun. If this picture is correct, then it is hard to assess\nwhich theory or paradigm is more faithful to the facts, that is, more\nobjective.\n\nThe thesis of the theory-ladenness of observation has also been\nextended to the incommensurability of different paradigms or\nscientific theories, problematized independently by Thomas S.\nKuhn (1962 [1970]) and Paul Feyerabend (1962). Literally, this concept\nmeans \u201chaving no measure in common\u201d, and it figures\nprominently in arguments against a linear and standpoint-independent\npicture of scientific progress. For instance, the Special Theory of\nRelativity appears to be more faithful to the facts and therefore more\nobjective than Newtonian mechanics because it reduces, for low speeds,\nto the latter, and it accounts for some additional facts that are not\npredicted correctly by Newtonian mechanics. This picture is\nundermined, however, by two central aspects of incommensurability.\nFirst, not only do the observational concepts in both theories differ,\nbut the principles for specifying their meaning may be inconsistent\nwith each other (Feyerabend 1975: 269\u2013270). Second, scientific\nresearch methods and standards of evaluation change with the theories\nor paradigms. Not all puzzles that could be tackled in the old\nparadigm will be solved by the new one\u2014this is the phenomenon of\n\u201cKuhn loss\u201d.\n\nA meaningful use of objectivity presupposes, according to Feyerabend,\nto perceive and to describe the world from a specific perspective,\ne.g., when we try to verify the referential claims of a scientific\ntheory. Only within a peculiar scientific worldview, the\nconcept of objectivity may be applied meaningfully. That is,\nscientific method cannot free itself from the particular scientific\ntheory to which it is applied; the door to standpoint-independence is\nlocked. As Feyerabend puts it:\n\n\nour epistemic activities may have a decisive influence even upon the\nmost solid piece of cosmological furniture\u2014they make gods\ndisappear and replace them by heaps of atoms in empty space. (1978:\n70)\n\n\nKuhn and Feyerabend\u2019s theses about theory-ladenness of\nobservation, and their implications for the objectivity of scientific\ninquiry have been much debated afterwards, and have often been\nmisunderstood in a social constructivist sense. Therefore Kuhn later\nreturned to the topic of scientific objectivity, of which he gives his\nown characterization in terms of the shared cognitive values of a\nscientific community. We discuss Kuhn\u2019s later view in\n section 3.1.\n For a more thorough coverage, see the entries on\n theory and observation in science,\n the incommensurability of scientific theories and\n Thomas S. Kuhn.\n",
