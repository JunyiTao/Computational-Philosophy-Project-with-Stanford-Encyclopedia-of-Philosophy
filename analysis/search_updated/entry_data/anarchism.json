    "preamble": "\n\nAnarchism is a political theory that is skeptical of the justification\nof authority and power. Anarchism is usually grounded in moral claims\nabout the importance of individual liberty, often conceived as freedom\nfrom domination. Anarchists also offer a positive theory of human\nflourishing, based upon an ideal of equality, community, and\nnon-coercive consensus building. Anarchism has inspired practical\nefforts at establishing utopian communities, radical and revolutionary\npolitical agendas, and various forms of direct action. This entry\nprimarily describes \u201cphilosophical anarchism\u201d: it focuses\non anarchism as a theoretical idea and not as a form of political\nactivism. While philosophical anarchism describes a skeptical theory\nof political legitimation, anarchism is also a concept that has been\nemployed in philosophical and literary theory to describe a sort of\nanti-foundationalism. Philosophical anarchism can mean either a theory\nof political life that is skeptical of attempts to justify state\nauthority or a philosophical theory that is skeptical of the attempt\nto assert firm foundations for knowledge.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Varieties of Anarchism\n\nThere are various forms of anarchism. Uniting this variety is the\ngeneral critique of centralized, hierarchical power and authority.\nGiven that authority, centralization, and hierarchy show up in various\nways and in different discourses, institutions, and practices, it is\nnot surprising that the anarchist critique has been applied in diverse\nways.\n1.1 Political Anarchism\n\nAnarchism is primarily understood as a skeptical theory of political\nlegitimation. The term anarchism is derived from the negation of the\nGreek term arch\u00e9, which means first principle,\nfoundation, or ruling power. Anarchy is thus rule by no one or\nnon-rule. Some argue that non-ruling occurs when there is rule by\nall\u2014with consensus or unanimity providing an optimistic goal\n(see Depuis-D\u00e9ri 2010).\n\nPolitical anarchists focus their critique on state power, viewing\ncentralized, monopolistic coercive power as illegitimate. Anarchists\nthus criticize \u201cthe state\u201d. Bakunin provides a paradigm\nhistorical example, saying:\n\n\nIf there is a State, there must be domination of one class by another\nand, as a result, slavery; the State without slavery is\nunthinkable\u2014and this is why we are the enemies of the State.\n(Bakunin 1873 [1990: 178])\n\n\nA more recent example comes from Gerard Casey who writes,\n\u201cstates are criminal organizations. All states, not just the\nobviously totalitarian or repressive ones\u201d (Casey 2012: 1).\n\nSuch sweeping generalizations are difficult to support. Thus anarchism\nas political philosophy faces the challenge of specificity. States\nhave been organized in various ways. Political power is not\nmonolithic. Sovereignty is a complicated matter that includes\ndivisions and distributions of power (see Fiala 2015). Moreover, the\nhistorical and ideological context of a given anarchist\u2019s\ncritique makes a difference in the content of the political\nanarchist\u2019s critique. Bakunin was responding primarily to a\nMarxist and Hegelian view of the state, offering his critique from\nwithin the global socialist movement; Casey is writing in the\nTwenty-First Century in the era of liberalism and globalization,\noffering his critique from within the movement of contemporary\nlibertarianism. Some anarchists engage in broad generalizations,\naiming for a total critique of political power. Others will present a\nlocalized critique of a given political entity. An ongoing challenge\nfor those who would seek to understand anarchism is to realize how\nhistorically and ideologically diverse approaches fit under the\ngeneral anarchist umbrella. We look at political anarchism in detail\nbelow.\n1.2 Religious Anarchism\n\nThe anarchist critique has been extended toward the rejection of\nnon-political centralization and authority. Bakunin extended his\ncritique to include religion, arguing against both God and the State.\nBakunin rejected God as the absolute master, saying famously,\n\u201cif God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish\nhim\u201d (Bakunin 1882 [1970: 28]).\n\nThere are, however, religious versions of anarchism, which critique\npolitical authority from a standpoint that takes religion seriously.\nRapp (2012) has shown how anarchism can be found in Taoism. And\nRamnath (2011) has identified anarchist threads in Islamic Sufism, in\nHindu bhakti movements, in Sikhism\u2019s anti-caste\nefforts, and in Buddhism. We consider anarchism in connection with\nGandhi below. But we focus here on Christian anarchism.\n\nChristian anarchist theology views the kingdom of God as lying beyond\nany human principle of structure or order. Christian anarchists offer\nan anti-clerical critique of ecclesiastical and political power.\nTolstoy provides an influential example. Tolstoy claims that\nChristians have a duty not to obey political power and to refuse to\nswear allegiance to political authority (see Tolstoy 1894). Tolstoy\nwas also a pacifist. Christian anarcho-pacifism views the state as\nimmoral and unsupportable because of its connection with military\npower (see Christoyannopoulos 2011). But there are also non-pacifist\nChristian anarchists. Berdyaev, for example, builds upon Tolstoy and\nin his own interpretation of Christian theology. Berdyaev concludes:\n\u201cThe Kingdom of God is anarchy\u201d (Berdyaev 1940 [1944:\n148]).\n\nChristian anarchists have gone so far as to found separatist\ncommunities where they live apart from the structures of the state.\nNotable examples include New England transcendentalists such as\nWilliam Garrison and Adin Ballou. These transcendentalists had an\ninfluence on Tolstoy (see Perry 1973 [1995]).\n\nOther notable Christians with anarchist sympathies include Peter\nMaurin and Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement. In more recent\nyears, Christian anarchism has been defended by Jacques Ellul who\nlinks Christian anarchism to a broad social critique. In addition to\nbeing pacifistic, Ellul says, Christian anarchism should also be\n\u201cantinationalist, anticapitalist, moral, and\nantidemocratic\u201d (Ellul 1988 [1991: 13]). The Christian anarchist\nought to be committed to \u201ca true overturning of authorities of\nall kinds\u201d (Ellul 1988 [1991: 14]). When asked whether a\nChristian anarchist should vote, Ellul says no. He states,\n\u201canarchy first implies conscientious objection\u201d (Ellul\n1988 [1991: 15]).\n1.3 Theoretical Anarchism\n\nAnarchist rejection of authority has application in epistemology and\nin philosophical and literary theory. One significant usage of the\nterm shows up in American pragmatism. William James described his\npragmatist philosophical theory as a kind of anarchism: \u201cA\nradical pragmatist is a happy-go-lucky anarchistic sort of\ncreature\u201d (James 1907 [1981: 116]). James had anarchist\nsympathies, connected to a general critique of systematic philosophy\n(see Fiala 2013b). Pragmatism, like other anti-systematic and\npost-Hegelian philosophies, gives up on the search for an\narch\u00e9 or foundation.\n\nAnarchism thus shows up as a general critique of prevailing methods.\nAn influential example is found in the work of Paul Feyerabend, whose\nAgainst Method provides an example of \u201ctheoretical\nanarchism\u201d in epistemology and philosophy of science (Feyerabend\n1975 [1993]). Feyerabend explains:\n\n\nScience is an essentially anarchic enterprise: theoretical anarchism\nis more humanitarian and more likely to encourage progress than its\nlaw-and-order alternatives. (Feyerabend 1975 [1993: 9])\n\n\nHis point is that science ought not be constrained by hierarchically\nimposed principles and strict rule following.\n\nPost-structuralism and trends in post-modernism and Continental\nphilosophy can also be anarchistic (see May 1994). So-called\n\u201cpost-anarchism\u201d is a decentered and free-flowing\ndiscourse that deconstructs power, questions essentialism, and\nundermines systems of authority. Following upon the deconstructive and\ncritical work of authors such as Derrida, Deleuze, Foucault, and\nothers, this critique of the arch\u00e9 goes all the way\ndown. If there is no arch\u00e9 or foundation, then we are\nleft with a proliferation of possibilities. Emerging trends in\nglobalization, cyber-space, and post-humanism make the anarchist\ncritique of \u201cthe state\u201d more complicated, since\nanarchism\u2019s traditional celebration of liberty and autonomy can\nbe critically scrutinized and deconstructed (see Newman 2016).\n\nTraditional anarchists were primarily interested in sustained and\nfocused political activism that led toward the abolition of the state.\nThe difference between free-flowing post-anarchism and traditional\nanarchism can be seen in the realm of morality. Anarchism has\ntraditionally been critical of centralized moral authority\u2014but\nthis critique was often based upon fundamental principles and\ntraditional values, such as autonomy or liberty. But\npost-structuralism\u2014along with critiques articulated by some\nfeminists, critical race theorists, and critics of\nEurocentrism\u2014calls these values and principles into\nquestion.\n1.4 Applied Anarchism\n\nThe broad critical framework provided by the anarchist critique of\nauthority provides a useful theory or methodology for social critique.\nIn more recent iterations, anarchism has been used to critique gender\nhierarchies, racial hierarchies, and the like\u2014also including a\ncritique of human domination over nature. Thus anarchism also\nincludes, to name a few varieties: anarcha-feminism or feminist\nanarchism (see Kornegger 1975), queer anarchism or anarchist queer\ntheory (see Daring et al. 2010), green anarchism or eco-anarchism also\nassociated with anarchist social ecology (see Bookchin 1971 [1986]),\nBlack and indigenous anarchisms and other anarchist critiques of white\nsupremacy and Eurocentrism (to be discussed below); and even\nanarcho-veganism or \u201cveganarchism\u201d (see Nocella, White,\n& Cudworth 2015). In the anarcho-vegan literature we find the\nfollowing description of a broad and inclusive anarchism:\n\n\nAnarchism is a socio-political theory which opposes all systems of\ndomination and oppression such as racism, ableism, sexism,\nanti-LGBTTQIA, ageism, sizeism, government, competition, capitalism,\ncolonialism, imperialism and punitive justice, and promotes direct\ndemocracy, collaboration, interdependence, mutual aid, diversity,\npeace, transformative justice and equity. (Nocella et al. 2015: 7)\n\n\nA thorough-going anarchism would thus offer a critique of anything and\neverything that smacks of hierarchy, domination, centralization, and\nunjustified authority.\n\nAnarchists who share these various commitments often act upon their\ncritique of authority by engaging in nonconformist practices (free\nlove, nudism, gender disruption, and so on) or by forming intentional\ncommunities that live \u201coff the grid\u201d and outside of the\nnorms of mainstream culture. In extreme forms this becomes\nanarcho-primitivism or anti-civilizational anarchism (see Zerzan 2008,\n2010; Jensen 2006). Alternative anarchist societies have existed in\nreligious communes in post-Reformation Europe and in the early United\nStates, in Nineteenth Century American utopian communities, the hippy\ncommunes of the Twentieth Century, anarchist squats, temporary\nautonomous zones (see Bey 1985), and occasional gatherings of\nlike-minded people.\n\nGiven this sort of antinomianism and non-conformism it is easy to see\nthat anarchism also often includes a radical critique of traditional\nethical norms and principles. Thus radical ethical anarchism can be\ncontrasted with what we might call bourgeois anarchism (with radical\nanarchism seeking to disrupt traditional social norms and bourgeois\nanarchism seeking freedom from the state that does not seek such\ndisruption). And although some argue that anarchists are deeply\nethical\u2014committed to liberty and solidarity\u2014others will\nargue that anarchists are moral nihilists who reject morality entirely\nor who at least reject the idea that there could be a single source of\nmoral authority (see essays in Franks & Wilson 2010).\n\nIn more recent explorations and applications of anarchist thought, the\nanarchist critique has been related and connected to a variety of\nemerging theoretical issues and applied concerns. Hilary Lazar (2018)\nfor example, explores how anarchism connects to intersectionality and\nissues related to multiculturalism. And Sky Croeser (2019) explores\nhow anarchism is connected to the emerging technologies including the\nInternet. And there are anarchist elements in the development of\nshared technological and information, as for example in the\ndevelopment of cryptocurrencies, which create economies that outside\nof traditional state-based economic systems.\n1.5 Black, Indigenous, and Decolonizing Anarchism\n\nAs mentioned above, among the varieties of applied anarchism we find\nanarchism associated with various liberation movements and critiques\nof white supremacy, Eurocentrism, and colonialism. This could be\nconnected with feminist anarchism, women\u2019s liberation movements,\nand an anarchist critique of patriarchy. We\u2019ll focus here on the\nanarchist critique found in Black and indigenous liberation movements.\nGandhi\u2019s movement in India could be included here (as discussed\nbelow). \n\nOne focal point here is a claim about anarchist characteristics\nthought to be found in the social structures of indigenous peoples.\nSometimes this is a romantic projection of anti-civilizational\nanarchists such as John Zerzan, who echoes Rousseau\u2019s naive and\nill-informed ideal of the \u201cnoble savage.\u201d One must be careful to avoid\nessentializing claims made about indigenous cultures and political\nsocieties. The Inca and the Aztec empires were obviously not utopian\nanarchist collectives. Nonetheless, scholars of indigeneity affirm the\nanarchist critique of dominant hegemonies as part of the effort of\nliberation that would allow indigenous people a degree of\nself-determination (see Johnson and Ferguson 2019).\n\nBlack and indigenous anarchisms provide a radical critique, which\nholds that the global history of genocide, slavery, colonization, and\nexploitation rest upon the assumption of white supremacy. White\nsupremacy is thus understood, from this point of view, as a\npresupposition of statism, centralization, hierarchy, and authority.\nThe anarchist critique of white supremacy is thus linked to a critique\nof social and political systems that evolved out of the history of\nslavery and native genocide to include apartheid, inequality,\ncaste/racial hierarchies, and other forms of structural racism. Some\ndefenders of Black anarchism go so far as to suggest that when\n\u201cBlackness\u201d is defined in opposition to structures of white supremacy,\nthere is a kind of anarchism woven into the concept. Anderson and\nSamudzi write, \n\n\nWhile bound to the laws of the land, Black America can be understood\nas an extra-state entity because of Black exclusion from the liberal\nsocial contract. Due to this extra-state location, Blackness is, in so\nmany ways, anarchistic. (Anderson and Samudzi 2017: no page\nnumbers)\n\n\nThis implies that the experience of Black people unfolds in a social\nand political world that its defined by its exclusion from power. A\nsimilar implication holds for indigenous people, who have been\nsubjugated and dominated by colonial power. Liberation movements thus\nspring from a social experience that is in a sense anarchic (i.e.,\ndeveloped in exclusion from and opposition to structures of power).\nIt is not surprising, then, that some liberatory activists espouse and\naffirm anarchism. The American activist Lorenzo Kom\u2019boa Ervin,\nfor example, affirms anarchism in pursuit of Black liberation (Ervin\n1997 [2016]). He explains that Black anarchism is different from what\nhe describes as the more authoritarian hierarchy of the Black Panther\nparty. He also argues against the authoritarian structure of\nreligiously oriented Black liberation movements, such as that led by\nMartin Luther King, Jr. \n\nA significant issue in Black and indigenous anarchisms is the effort\nto decolonize anarchism itself. Many of the key figures in the\nanarchist tradition are white, male, and European. The concerns of\nanarchists such as Kropotkin or Bakunin may be different from the\nconcerns of African Americans or from the concerns of indigenous\npeople in Latin America or elsewhere around the globe. One solution to\nthis problem is to retrieve forgotten voices from within the\ntradition. In this regard, we might consider Lucy Parsons (also known\nas Lucy Gonzalez), a former slave who espoused anarchism. Parsons\nexplained that she affirmed anarchism because the political status quo\nproduced nothing but misery and starvation for the masses of humanity.\nTo resolve this an anarchist revolution was needed. Parsons said,\n\n\nMost anarchists believe the coming change can only come through a\nrevolution, because the possessing class will not allow a peaceful\nchange to take place; still we are willing to work for peace at any\nprice, except at the price of liberty. (Parsons 1905 [2010])\n\n2. Anarchism in Political Philosophy\n\nAnarchism in political philosophy maintains that there is no\nlegitimate political or governmental authority. In political\nphilosophy anarchy is an important topic for consideration\u2014even\nfor those who are not anarchists\u2014as the a-political background\ncondition against which various forms of political organization are\narrayed, compared, and justified. Anarchy is often viewed by\nnon-anarchists as the unhappy or unstable condition in which there is\nno legitimate authority. Anarchism as a philosophical idea is not\nnecessarily connected to practical activism. There are political\nanarchists who take action in order to destroy what they see as\nillegitimate states. The popular imagination often views anarchists as\nbomb-throwing nihilists. But philosophical anarchism is a theoretical\nstandpoint. In order to decide who (and whether) one should act upon\nanarchist insight, we require a further theory of political action,\nobligation, and obedience grounded in further ethical reflection.\nSimmons explains that philosophical anarchists \u201cdo not take the\nillegitimacy of states to entail a strong moral imperative to oppose\nor eliminate states\u201d (Simmons 2001: 104). Some anarchists remain\nobedient to ruling authorities; others revolt or resist in various\nways. The question of action depends upon a theory of what sort of\npolitical obligation follows from our philosophical, moral, political,\nreligious, and aesthetic commitments.\n2.1 Anarchism in the History of Political Philosophy\n\nThere is a long history of political anarchism. In the ancient world,\nanarchism of a sort can be found in the ideas of the Epicureans and\nCynics. Kropotkin makes this point in his 1910 encyclopedia article.\nAlthough they did not employ the term anarchism, the Epicureans and\nCynics avoided political activity, advising retreat from political\nlife in pursuit of tranquility (ataraxia) and self-control\n(autarkeai). The Cynics are also known for advocating\ncosmopolitanism: living without allegiance to any particular state or\nlegal system, while associating with human beings based upon moral\nprinciple outside of traditional state structures. Diogenes the Cynic\nhad little respect for political or religious authority. One of his\nguiding ideas was to \u201cdeface the currency\u201d. This meant not\nonly devaluing or destroying monetary currency but also a general\nrejection of the norms of civilized society (see Marshall 2010: 69).\nDiogenes often mocked political authorities and failed to offer signs\nof respect. While Diogenes actively disrespected established norms,\nEpicurus counseled retreat. He advised living unnoticed and avoiding\npolitical life (under the phrase me politeuesthai\u2014which\ncan be understood as an anti-political admonition).\n\nThe assumption that anarchy would be unhappy or unstable leads to\njustifications of political power. In Hobbes\u2019 famous phrase, in\nthe stateless\u2014anarchic\u2014condition of \u201cthe state\nnature\u201d human life would be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and\nshort. Hobbes\u2019 social contract\u2014as well as other versions\nof the social contract theory as found for example in Locke or\nRousseau\u2014are attempts to explain how and why the political state\nemerges from out of the anarchic state of nature.\n\nAnarchists respond by claiming that the state tends to produce its own\nsort of unhappiness: as oppressive, violent, corrupt, and inimical to\nliberty. Discussions about the social contract thus revolve around the\nquestion of whether the state is better than anarchy\u2014or whether\nstates and state-like entities naturally and inevitably emerge from\nout of the original condition of anarchy. One version of this argument\nabout the inevitable emergence of states (by way of something like an\n\u201cinvisible hand\u201d) is found in Nozick\u2019s influential\nAnarchy, State, Utopia (1974). While Nozick and other\npolitical philosophers take anarchy seriously as a starting point,\nanarchists will argue that invisible hand arguments of this sort\nignore the historical actuality of states, which develop out of a long\nhistory of domination, inequality, and oppression. Murray Rothbard has\nargued against Nozick and social contract theory, saying, \u201cno\nexisting state has been immaculately conceived\u201d (Rothbard 1977:\n46). Different versions of the social contract theory, such as we find\nin John Rawls\u2019s work, view the contract situation as a heuristic\ndevice allowing us to consider justice from under \u201cthe veil of\nignorance\u201d. But anarchists will argue that the idea of the\noriginal position does not necessarily lead to the justification of\nthe state\u2014especially given background knowledge about the\ntendency of states to be oppressive. Crispin Sartwell concludes:\n\n\nEven accepting more or less all of the assumptions Rawls packs into\nthe original position, it is not clear that the contractors would not\nchoose anarchy. (Sartwell 2008: 83)\n\n\nThe author of the present essay has described anarchism that results\nfrom a critique of the social contract tradition as \u201cliberal\nsocial contract anarchism\u201d (Fiala 2013a).\n\nAn important historical touchstone is William Godwin. Unlike Locke and\nHobbes who turned to the social contract to lead us out of the\nanarchic state of nature, Godwin argued that the resulting\ngovernmental power was not necessarily better than anarchy. Locke, of\ncourse, allows for revolution when the state becomes despotic. Godwin\nbuilds upon that insight. He explained, \u201cwe must not hastily\nconclude that the mischiefs of anarchy are worse than those which\ngovernment is qualified to produce\u201d (Godwin 1793: bk VII, chap.\nV, p. 736). He claimed,\n\n\nIt is earnestly to be desired that each man should be wise enough to\ngovern himself, without the intervention of any compulsory restraint;\nand, since government, even in its best state, is an evil, the object\nprincipally to be aimed at is that we should have as little of it as\nthe general peace of human society will permit. (Godwin 1793: bk III,\nchap. VII, p. 185\u20136)\n\n\nLike Rousseau, who praised the noble savage, who was free from social\nchains until forced into society, Godwin imagined original anarchy\ndeveloping into the political state, which tended on his view to\nbecome despotic. Once the state comes into being, Godwin suggests that\ndespotism is the primary problem since \u201cdespotism is as\nperennial as anarchy is transitory\u201d (Godwin 1793: bk VII, chap.\nV, p. 736).\n\nAnarchism is often taken to mean that individuals ought to be left\nalone without any unifying principle or governing power. In some cases\nanarchism is related to libertarianism (or what is sometimes called\n\u201canarcho-capitalism\u201d). But non-rule may also occur when\nthere is unanimity or consensus\u2014and hence no need for external\nauthority or a governing structure of command and obedience. If there\nwere unanimity among individuals, there would be no need for\n\u201cruling\u201d, authority, or government. The ideas of unanimity\nand consensus are associated with the positive conception of anarchism\nas a voluntary association of autonomous human beings, which promotes\ncommunal values. One version of the anarchist ideal imagines the\ndevolution of centralized political authority, leaving us with\ncommunes whose organizational structure is open-ended and\nconsensual.\n\nGiven this emphasis on communal organization it is not surprising that\npolitical anarchism has a close historical association with communism,\ndespite the connection mentioned above with free market capitalism.\nAuthors such as Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Goldman developed their\nanarchism as a response to Marx and Marxism. One of the first authors\nto explicitly affirm anarchism, Pierre Proudhon, defended a kind of\n\u201ccommunism\u201d, which he understood as being grounded in\ndecentralized associations, communes, and mutual-aid societies.\nProudhon thought that private property created despotism. He argued\nthat liberty required anarchy, concluding,\n\n\nThe government of man by man (under whatever name it be disguised) is\noppression. Society finds its highest perfection in the union of order\nwith anarchy. (Proudhon 1840 [1876: 286])\n\n\nFollowing Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, and the other so-called\n\u201cclassical anarchists\u201d, anarchism comes to be seen as a\nfocal point for political philosophy and activism.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to a conceptual analysis of different arguments made\nin defense of anarchism.\n2.2 Absolute, Deontological, and a priori Anarchism\n\nAnarchists often make categorical claims to the effect that no state\nis legitimate or that there can no such thing as a justifiable\npolitical state. As an absolute or a priori claim, anarchism\nholds that all states always and everywhere are illegitimate and\nunjust. The term \u201ca priori anarchism\u201d is found in\nSimmons 2001; but it is employed already by Kropotkin in his\ninfluential 1910 article on anarchism, where he claims that anarchists\nare not utopians who argue against the state in a priori\nfashion (Kropotkin 1927 [2002: 285]). Despite Kropotkin\u2019s claim,\nsome anarchists do offer a priori arguments against the\nstate. This sort of claim rests upon an account of the justification\nof authority that is usually grounded in some form of deontological\nmoral claim about the importance of individual liberty and a logical\nclaim about the nature of state authority.\n\nOne typical and well-known example of this argument is found in the\nwork of Robert Paul Wolff. Wolff indicates that legitimate authority\nrests upon a claim about the right to command obedience (Wolff 1970).\nCorrelative to this is a duty to obey: one has a duty to obey\nlegitimate authority. As Wolff explains, by appealing to ideas found\nin Kant and Rousseau, the duty to obey is linked to notions about\nautonomy, responsibility, and rationality. But for Wolff and other\nanarchists, the problem is that the state does not have legitimate\nauthority. As Wolff says of the anarchist, \u201che will never view\nthe commands of the state as legitimate, as having a binding moral\nforce\u201d (Wolff 1970: 16). The categorical nature of this claim\nindicates a version of absolute anarchism. If the state\u2019s\ncommands are never legitimate and create no moral duty of obedience,\nthen there can never be a legitimate state. Wolff imagines that there\ncould be a legitimate state grounded in \u201cunanimous direct\ndemocracy\u201d\u2014but he indicates that unanimous direct\ndemocracy would be \u201cso restricted in its application that it\noffers no serious hope of ever being embodied in an actual\nstate\u201d (Wolff 1970: 55). Wolff concludes:\n\n\nIf all men have a continuing obligation to achieve the highest degree\nof autonomy possible, then there would appear to be no state whose\nsubjects have a moral obligation to obey its commands. Hence, the\nconcept of a de jure legitimate state would appear to be vacuous, and\nphilosophical anarchism would seem to be the only reasonable political\nbelief for an enlightened man. (Wolff 1970: 17)\n\n\nAs Wolff puts it here, there appears to be \u201cno state\u201d that\nis legitimate. This claim is stated in absolute and a priori\nfashion, a point made by Reiman in his critique of Wolff (Reiman\n1972). Wolff does not deny, by the way, that there are de facto\nlegitimate states: governments often do have the approval and support\nof the people they govern. But this approval and support is merely\nconventional and not grounded in a moral duty; and approval and\nsupport are manufactured and manipulated by the coercive power and\npropaganda and ideology of the state.\n\nWe noted here that Wolff\u2019s anarchism is connected to Kant. But\nKant is no anarchist: he defended the idea of enlightened republican\ngovernment in which autonomy would be preserved. Rousseau may be\ncloser to espousing anarchism in some of his remarks\u2014although\nthese are far from systematic (see McLaughlin 2007). Some authors view\nRousseau as espousing something close to \u201ca posteriori\nphilosophical anarchism\u201d (see Bertram 2010 [2017])\u2014which\nwe will define in the next section. Among classical political\nphilosophers, we might also consider Locke in connection with\n\u201clibertarian anarchism\u201d (see Varden 2015) or Locke as\noffering a theory \u201con the edge of anarchism\u201d, as Simmons\nhas put it (Simmons 1993). But despite his strong defense of\nindividual rights, the stringent way he describes voluntary consent,\nand his advocacy of revolution, Locke believes that states can be\ndefended based upon the social contract theory.\n\nLeaving the canonical authors of Western political philosophy aside,\nthe most likely place to find deontological and a priori\nanarchism is among the Christian anarchists. Of course, most\nChristians are not anarchists. But those Christians who espouse\nanarchism usually do so with the absolute, deontological, and a\npriori claims of the sort made by Tolstoy, Berdyaev, and\nEllul\u2014as noted above.\n2.3 Contingent, Consequentialist, and a posteriori Anarchism\n\nA less stringent form of anarchism will argue that states could be\njustified in theory\u2014even though, in practice, no state or very\nfew states are actually legitimate. Contingent anarchism will hold\nthat states in the present configuration of things fail to live up to\nthe standards of their own justification. This is an a\nposteriori argument (see Simmons 2001) based both in a\ntheoretical account of the justification of the state (for example,\nthe social contract theory of liberal-democratic theory) and in an\nempirical account of how and why concrete states fail to be justified\nbased upon this theory. The author of the present article has offered\na version of this argument based upon the social contract theory,\nholding that the liberal-democratic social contract theory provides\nthe best theory of the justification of the state, while arguing that\nvery few states actually live up to the promise of the social contract\ntheory (Fiala 2013a).\n\nOne version of the contingent anarchist argument focuses on the\nquestion of the burden of proof for accounts that would justify\npolitical authority. This approach has been articulated by Noam\nChomsky, who explains:\n\n\n[This] is what I have always understood to be the essence of\nanarchism: the conviction that the burden of proof has to be placed on\nauthority, and that it should be dismantled if that burden cannot be\nmet. Sometimes the burden can be met. (Chomsky 2005: 178)\n\n\nChomsky accepts legitimate authority based in ordinary experience: for\nexample, when a grandfather prevents a child from darting out into the\nstreet. But state authority is a much more complicated affair.\nPolitical relationships are attenuated; there is the likelihood of\ncorruption and self-interest infecting political reality; there are\nlevels and degrees of mediation, which alienate us from the source of\npolitical authority; and the rational autonomy of adults is important\nand fundamental. By focusing on the burden of proof, Chomsky\nacknowledges that there may be ways to meet the burden of proof for\nthe justification of the state. But he points out that there is a\nprima facie argument against the state\u2014which is based in a\ncomplex historical and empirical account of the role of power,\neconomics, and historical inertia in creating political institutions.\nHe explains:\n\n\nSuch institutions face a heavy burden of proof: it must be shown that\nunder existing conditions, perhaps because of some overriding\nconsideration of deprivation or threat, some form of authority,\nhierarchy, and domination is justified, despite the prima facie case\nagainst it\u2014a burden that can rarely be met. (Chomsky 2005:\n174)\n\n\nChomsky does not deny that the burden of proof could be met. Rather,\nhis point is that there is a prima facie case against the state, since\nthe burden of proof for the justification of the state is rarely\nmet.\n\nContingent anarchism is based in consequentialist reasoning, focused\non details of historical actuality. Consequentialist anarchism will\nappeal to utilitarian considerations, arguing that states generally\nfail to deliver in terms of promoting the happiness of the greater\nnumber of people\u2014and more strongly that state power tends to\nproduce unhappiness. The actuality of inequality, classism, elitism,\nracism, sexism, and other forms of oppression can be used to support\nan anarchist argument, holding that even though a few people benefit\nfrom state power, a larger majority suffers under it.\n\nThere is a significant difference between anarchism that is offered in\npursuit of utilitarianism\u2019s greater happiness ideal and\nanarchism that is offered in defense of the minority against the\ntyranny of the majority. As we shall see in the next section,\nindividualist anarchists are primarily concerned with the tendency of\nutilitarian politics to sacrifice the rights of individuals in the\nname of the greater good.\n\nBefore turning to that conception of anarchism, let\u2019s note two\nclassical authors who offer insight into utilitarian anarchism. Godwin\narticulated a form of anarchism that is connected to a utilitarian\nconcern. Godwin\u2019s general moral thought is utilitarian in basic\nconception, even though he also argues based upon fundamental\nprinciples such as the importance of liberty. But Godwin\u2019s\narguments are a posteriori, based upon generalizations from\nhistory and with an eye toward the future development of happiness and\nliberty. He writes:\n\n\nAbove all we should not forget, that government is an evil, an\nusurpation upon the private judgment and individual conscience of\nmankind; and that, however we may be obliged to admit it as a\nnecessary evil for the present. (Godwin 1793: bk V, ch. I, p. 380)\n\n\nThis claim is similar to Chomsky\u2019s insofar as it recognizes the\ncomplicated nature of the historical dialectic. The goal of political\ndevelopment should be in a direction that goes beyond the state (and\ntoward the development of individual reason and morality). But in our\npresent condition, some form of government may be \u201ca necessary\nevil\u201d, which we ought to strive to overcome. The point here is\nthat our judgments about the justification of the state are\ncontingent: they depend upon present circumstances and our current\nform of development. And while states may be necessary features of the\ncurrent human world, as human beings develop further, it is possible\nthat the state might outlive its usefulness.\n\nWe should note that utilitarian arguments are often used to support\nstate structures in the name of the greater good. Utilitarian\nanarchists will argue that states fail to do this. But utilitarian\nconclusions are not usually based upon a fundamental appeal to moral\nprinciples such as liberty or the rights of the individual. Thus\nBentham described claims about human rights as \u201canarchical\nfallacies\u201d because they tended to lead toward anarchy, which he\nrejected. Bentham described the difference between a moderate\nutilitarian effort at reform and the anarchist\u2019s revolutionary\ndoctrine of human rights, saying that\n\n\nthe anarchist setting up his will and fancy for a law before which all\nmankind are called upon to bow down at the first word\u2014the\nanarchist, trampling on truth and decency, denies the validity of the\nlaw in question,\u2014denies the existence of it in the character of\na law, and calls upon all mankind to rise up in a mass, and resist the\nexecution of it. (Bentham 1843: 498)\n\n\nMore principled deontological anarchism will maintain that states\nviolate fundamental rights and so are not justified. But utilitarian\nanarchism will not primarily be worried about the violation of a few\npeople\u2019s rights (although that is obviously a relevant\nconsideration). Rather, the complaint for a utilitarian anarchist is\nthat state structures tend to produce disadvantages for the greater\nnumber of people. Furthermore what Oren Ben-Dor calls\n\u201cutilitarian-based anarchism\u201d is based upon the idea that\nthere is no a priori justification of the state (Ben-Dor\n2000: 101\u20132). For the utilitarian, this all depends upon the\ncircumstances and conditions. Ben-Dor calls this anarchism because it\nrejects any a priori notion of state justification. In other\nwords, the utilitarian anarchist does not presume that states are\njustifiable; rather a utilitarian anarchist will hold that the burden\nof proof rests upon the defender of states to show that state\nauthority is justifiable on utilitarian grounds, by bringing in\nhistorical and empirical data about human nature, human flourishing,\nand successful social organization.\n2.4 Individualism, Libertarianism, and Socialist Anarchism\n\nForms of anarchism also differ in terms of the content of the theory,\nthe focal point of the anarchist critique, and the imagined practical\nimpact of anarchism. Socialist forms of anarchism include communist\nanarchism associated with Kropotkin and communitarian anarchism (see\nClark 2013). The socialist approach focuses on the development of\nsocial and communal groups, which are supposed to thrive outside of\nhierarchical and centralized political structures. Individualist forms\nof anarchism include some forms of libertarianism or\nanarcho-capitalism as well as egoistically oriented antinomianism and\nnon-conformism. The individualistic focus rejects group identity and\nideas about social/communal good, while remaining firmly rooted in\nmoral claims about the autonomy of the individual (see Casey\n2012).\n\nIndividualistic anarchism is historically associated with ideas found\nin Stirner who said, \u201cevery state is a despotism\u201d (Stirner\n1844 [1995: 175]). He argued that there was no duty to obey the state\nand the law because the law and the state impair self-development and\nself-will. The state seeks to tame our desires and along with the\nchurch it undermines self-enjoyment and the development of unique\nindividuality. Stirner is even critical of social organizations and\npolitical parties. While not denying that an individual could\naffiliate with such organizations, he maintains that the individual\nretains rights and identity against the party or social organization:\nhe embraces the party; but he ought not allow himself to be\n\u201cembraced and taken up by the party\u201d (Stirner 1844 [1995:\n211]). Individualist anarchism has often been attributed to a variety\nof thinkers including Josiah Warren, Benjamin Tucker, and Thoreau.\n\nIndividualist anarchism also seems to have something in common with\negoism of the sort associated with Ayn Rand. But Rand dismissed\nanarchism as \u201ca na\u00efve floating abstraction\u201d that\ncould not exist in reality; and she argued that governments properly\nexisted to defend people\u2019s rights (Rand 1964). A more robust\nsort of pro-capitalist anarchism has been defended by Murray Rothbard,\nwho rejects \u201cleft-wing anarchism\u201d of the sort he\nassociates with communism, while applauding the individualist\nanarchism of Tucker (Rothbard 2008). Rothbard continues to explain\nthat since anarchism has usually been considered as being primarily a\nleft-wing communist phenomenon, libertarianism should be distinguished\nfrom anarchism by calling it \u201cnon-archism\u201d (Rothbard\n2008). A related term has been employed in the literature,\n\u201cmin-archism\u201d, which has been used to describe the minimal\nstate that libertarians allow (see Machan 2002). Libertarians are\nstill individualists, who emphasize the importance of individual\nliberty, even though they disagree with full-blown anarchists about\nthe degree to which state power can be justified.\n\nIt is worth considering here, the complexity of the notion of liberty\nunder consideration by appealing to Isaiah Berlin\u2019s well-known\ndistinction between negative and positive liberty (Berlin 1969). Some\nindividualist anarchists appear to focus on negative liberty, i.e.,\nfreedom from constraint, authority, and domination. But anarchism has\nalso been concerned with community and the social good. In this sense,\nanarchists are focused on something like positive liberty and concerned\nwith creating and sustaining the social conditions necessary for\nactualizing human flourishing. In this regard, anarchists have also\noffered theories of institutional rules and social structures that are\nnon-authoritarian. This may sound paradoxical (i.e., that anarchists\nespouse rules and structures at all). But Prichard has argued that\nanarchists are also interested in \u201cfreedom within\u201d institutions and\nsocial structures. According to Prichard rather than focusing on\nstate-authority, anarchist institutions will be be open-ended\nprocesses that are complex and non-linear (Prichard 2018).\n\nWe see then, that individualist anarchism that focuses only on\nnegative liberty is often rejected by anarchists who are interested in\nreconceiving community and restructuring society along more\negalitarian lines. Indeed, individualistic anarchism has been\ncriticized as merely a matter of \u201clifestyle\u201d (criticized\nin Bookchin 1995), which focuses on dress, behavior, and other\nindividualistic choices and preferences. Bookchin and other critics of\nlifestyle individualism will argue that mere non-conformism does very\nlittle to change the status quo and overturn structures of domination\nand authority. Nor does non-conformism and lifestyle anarchism work to\ncreate and sustain systems that affirm liberty and equality. But\ndefenders of lifestyle non-conformism will argue that there is value\nin opting out of cultural norms and demonstrating contempt for\nconformity through individual lifestyle choices.\n\nA more robust form of individualist anarchism will focus on key values\nsuch as autonomy and self-determination, asserting the primacy of the\nindividual over and against social groups as a matter of rights.\nIndividualist anarchists can admit that collective action is important\nand that voluntary cooperation among individuals can result in\nbeneficial and autonomy preserving community. Remaining disputes will\nconsider whether what results from individual cooperation is a form of\ncapitalism or a form of social sharing or communism. Libertarian\nanarchists or anarcho-capitalists will defend free market ideas based\nupon individual choices in trading and producing goods for market.\n\nOn the other hand, socialist or communistically oriented anarchism\nwill focus more on a sharing economy. This could be a large form of\nmutualism or something local and concrete like the sharing of family\nlife or the traditional potlatch. But these ideas remain anarchist to\nthe extent that they want to avoid centralized control and the\ndevelopment of hierarchical structures of domination. Unlike\nstate-centered communism of the sort developed by Marxists, anarchist\ncommunism advocates decentralization. The motto of this approach comes\nfrom Kropotkin: \u201call for all\u201d. In The Conquest of\nBread (1892) Kropotkin criticizes monopolistic centralization\nthat prevents people from gaining access to socially generated wealth.\nThe solution is \u201call for all\u201d: \u201cWhat we proclaim is\nthe Right to Well-Being: Well-Being for All!\u201d (Kropotkin 1892\n[1995: 20]). The communist idea that all humans should enjoy the\nfruits of the collective human product shares something with the\nMarxist idea of \u201cto each according to his need\u201d (Marx\n1875). But Kropotkin argues for the need to evolve beyond centralized\ncommunist control\u2014what he criticizes as mere\n\u201ccollectivism\u201d\u2014and toward anarchist communism:\n\n\nAnarchy leads to communism, and communism to anarchy, both alike being\nexpressions of the predominant tendency in modern societies, the\npursuit of equality. (Kropotkin 1892 [1995: 31])\n\n\nKropotkin argues that the communal impulse already exists and that the\nadvances in social wealth made possible by the development of\nindividualistic capitalism make it likely that we will develop in the\ndirection of communal sharing. He argues that the tendency of history\nis away from centralized power and toward equality and\nliberty\u2014and toward the abolition of the state. Kropotkin\u2019s\ncommunist anarchism is based upon some historical and empirical\nclaims: about whether things can actually be arranged more\nsatisfactorily without state intervention; and about whether states\nreally do personify injustice and oppression. Libertarianism and\nanarcho-capitalism also think that the free market will work to\nadequately maximize human well-being and help individuals to realize\ntheir own autonomy. But for the socialist and communist anarchists,\nthe question of individual self-realization is less important than the\nidea of social development. Kropotkin\u2019s \u201call for\nall\u201d indicates a moral and ontological focus that is different\nfrom what we find among the individualists.\n\nSocialist and communally focused forms of anarchism emphasize the\nimportance of social groups. For example, families can be viewed as\nanarchic structures of social cooperation and solidarity. A social\nanarchist would be critical of hierarchical and domineering forms of\nfamily organization (for example, patriarchal family structure). But\nsocial anarchists will emphasize the point that human identity and\nflourishing occur within extended social structures\u2014so long as\nit remains a free and self-determining community.\n\nThe tension between individualist and socialist anarchism comes to a\nhead when considering the question of the degree to which an\nindividual ought to be subordinated to the community. One problem for\nso-called \u201ccommunitarian\u201d theories of social and political\nlife is that they can result in the submergence of individuals into\nthe communal identity. Individualists will want to struggle against\nthis assault upon autonomy and individual identity. Communalists may\nrespond, as Clark does, by claiming that the ideal of a genuine\ncommunity of autonomous individuals remains a hoped for dream of an\n\u201cimpossible community\u201d (Clark 2013). On the other hand\ncommunally focused theorists will point out that individual human\nbeings cannot exist outside of communal structures: we are social\nanimals who flourish and survive in communities. Thus radical\nindividualism also remains a dream\u2014and as more politically\noriented anarchists will point out, individualism undermines the\npossibility of organized political action, which implies that\nindividualist anarchists will be unable to successfully resist\npolitical structures of domination.\n3. Anarchism and Political Activity\n\nAnarchism forces us to re-evaluate political activity. Ancient Greek\nphilosophers such as Aristotle and Plato held that human beings\nflourished within just political communities and that there was a\nvirtue in serving the polis. Modern political philosophy tended to\nhold, as well, that political action\u2014including obedience to the\nlaw and the ideal of a rule of law\u2014was noble and enlightened. In\nHegelian political philosophy, these ideas combine in a way that\ncelebrates citizenship and service to the state. And in contemporary\nliberal political philosophy, it is often presumed that obedience to\nthe law is required as a prima facie duty (see Reiman 1972;\nGans 1992). Anarchists, of course, call this all into question.\n\nThe crucial question for anarchists is thus whether one ought to\ndisengage from political life, whether one ought to submit to\npolitical authority and obey the law, or whether one ought to engage\nin active efforts to actively abolish the state. Those who opt to work\nactively for the abolition of the state often understand this as a\nform of \u201cdirect action\u201d or \u201cpropaganda of the\ndeed\u201d. The idea of direct action is often viewed as typical of\nanarchists, who believe that something ought to be done to actively\nabolish the state including: graffiti, street theater, organized\noccupations, boycotts, and even violence. There are disputes among\nanarchists about what ought to be done, with an important dividing\nline occurring with regard to the question of violence and criminal\nbehavior.\n\nBefore turning to that discussion, let\u2019s note one further\nimportant theoretical distinction with regard to the question of\ntaking action, connected to the typology offered above: whether action\nshould be justified in consequentialist or non-consequentialist terms.\nFranks has argued that anarchist direct action ought to exemplify a\nunity of means and ends (Franks 2003). On this view, if liberation and\nautonomy are what anarchists are pursuing, then the methods used to\nobtain these goods must be liberationist and celebrate\nautonomy\u2014and embody this within direct action. Franks argues\nthat the idea that \u201cthe end justifies the means\u201d is more\ntypical of state-centered movements, such as Bolshevism\u2014and of\nright-wing movements. While some may think that anarchists are willing\nto engage in action \u201cby any means necessary\u201d, that\nphraseology and the crass consequentialism underlying it is more\ntypical of radical movements which are not anarchist. Coercive\nimposition of the anarchist ideal re-inscribes the problem of\ndomination, hierarchy, centralization, and monopolistic power that the\nanarchist was originally opposed to.\n3.1 Nonviolence, Violence, and Criminality\n\nOne significant philosophical and ethical problem for politically\nengaged anarchists is the question of how to avoid ongoing cycles of\npower and violence that are likely to erupt in the absence of\ncentralized political power. One suggestion, mentioned above, is that\nanarchists will often want to emphasize the unity of means and ends.\nThis idea shows why there is some substantial overlap and conjunction\nbetween anarchism and pacifism. Pacifist typically emphasize the unity\nof means and ends. But not all pacifists are anarchists. However, we\nmentioned above that there is a connection between anarchism and\nChristian pacifism, as found in Tolstoy, for example. Gandhi was\ninfluenced by Tolstoy and the anarchists. Although Gandhi is better\nknown as an anti-colonial activist, Marshall includes Gandhi among the\nanarchists (Marshall 2010: chapter 26). It is possible to reconstruct\nanti-colonial movements and arguments about self-determination and\nhome rule as a kind of anarchism (aimed at destroying colonial power\nand imperial states). Gandhi noted that there were many anarchists\nworking in India in his time. In saying this, Gandhi uses the term\nanarchism to characterize bomb-throwing advocates of violence. He\nsays: \u201cI myself am an anarchist, but of another type\u201d\n(Gandhi 1916 [1956: 134]). Gandhian anarchism, if there is such a\nthing, embraces nonviolence. In general nonviolent resistance as\ndeveloped in the Tolstoy-Gandhi-King tradition fits with an approach\nthat turns away from political power and views the state as a purveyor\nof war and an impediment to equality and human development.\n\nObjecting to this anarcho-pacifist approach are more militant\nactivists who advocate direct action that can include sabotage and\nother forms of political violence including terrorism. Emma Goldman\nexplains, for example, that anti-capitalist sabotage undermines the\nidea of private possession. While the legal system considers this to\nbe criminal, Goldman contends it is not. She explains,\n\n\nit is ethical in the best sense, since it helps society to get rid of\nits worst foe, the most detrimental factor of social life. Sabotage is\nmainly concerned with obstructing, by every possible method, the\nregular process of production, thereby demonstrating the determination\nof the workers to give according to what they receive, and no more.\n(Goldman 1913 [1998: 94])\n\n\nGoldman struggled with the question of violence through the course of\nher career. Early on she was a more vocal proponent of revolutionary\nviolence. She began to rethink this later. Nonetheless, like other\nanarchists of her generation, she attributed violence to the state,\nwhich she opposed. She writes:\n\n\nI believe that Anarchism is the only philosophy of peace, the only\ntheory of the social relationship that values human life above\neverything else. I know that some Anarchists have committed acts of\nviolence, but it is the terrible economic inequality and great\npolitical injustice that prompt such acts, not Anarchism. Every\ninstitution today rests on violence; our very atmosphere is saturated\nwith it. (Goldman 1913 [1998: 59])\n\n\nGoldman views anarchist violence as merely reactive. In response to\nstate violence, the anarchists often argued that they were merely\nusing violence in self-defense. Another defender of violence is\nMalatesta who wrote that the revolution against the violence of the\nruling class must be violent. He explained:\n\n\nI think that a regime which is born of violence and which continues to\nexist by violence cannot be overthrown except by a corresponding and\nproportionate violence. (Malatesta 1925 [2015: 48])\n\n\nLike Goldman, Malatesta warned against violence becoming an end in\nitself and giving way to brutality and ferocity for its own sake. He\nalso described anarchists as preachers of love and advocates of peace.\nHe said,\n\n\nwhat distinguishes the anarchists from all others is in fact their\nhorror of violence, their desire and intention to eliminate physical\nviolence from human relations. (Malatesta 1924 [2015: 46])\n\n\nBut despite this rejection of violence, Malatesta advocates violence\nas a necessary evil.\n\nAnarchist violence appears as the violence of an individual against\nthe state. It is easy to see why such violence would be characterized\nas terroristic and criminal. For an individual to declare war against\nthe state and take action to disrupt the state is criminal. And thus\nanarchists have also been interested in a critique of crime and\ncriminality\u2014arguing that it is the law and the legal system that\ncreates and produces crime and criminality. This critique was advanced\nby Kropotkin as early as the 1870s, when he called prisons\n\u201cschools for crime\u201d. Similar ideas are found in Foucault\nand in more recent criticisms of mass incarceration. Contemporary\nanarchists will argue that mass incarceration is an example of state\npower run amok.\n3.2 Disobedience, Revolution, and Reform\n\nThe question of violence leads us to a further issue: the question of\nobedience, disobedience, resistance, and political obligation. Much\ncould be said here about the nature of political obligation and\nobedience: including whether obedience is merely pragmatic and\nstrategic or based upon notions about loyalty and claims about\nidentification with the nation and its laws. But it is clear that\nanarchists have no principled reason for political obedience. If the\nanarchist views the state as illegitimate, then obedience and\nparticipation are merely a matter of choice, preference, and\npragmatism\u2014and not a matter of loyalty or duty.\n\nChristian anarchists will look, for example, to the case of Jesus and\nhis idea of rendering unto Caesar what is due to Caesar (Matthew\n22:15\u201322). The anarchist interpretation of this passage claims\nthat this is an indication both of Jesus\u2019s disaffection with the\nstate and with his grudging acquiescence to political authority.\nChristoyannopoulos argues, \u201cJesus\u2019 political subversion is\ncarried out through submission rather than revolt\u201d\n(Christoyannopoulos 2010: 156). The crucifixion, on this\ninterpretation, is a subversive event, which \u201cunmasks\u201d\npolitical power as \u201cdemonic\u201d and illegitimate. Jesus does\nnot recognize the ultimate moral and religious authority of Caesar or\nPilate. But he goes along with the political regime. Thus some\nanarchists may simply be compliant and submissive.\n\nBut politically motivated anarchists encourage resistance to state\npower, including strategic and principled disobedience. Such\ndisobedience could involve symbolic actions\u2014graffiti and the\nlike\u2014or acts of civil resistance, protests, tax resistance and\nso on\u2014up to, and possibly including, sabotage, property crime,\nand outright violence. Again, there is overlap with the discussion of\nviolence here, but let\u2019s set that question aside and focus on\nthe notion of civil disobedience.\n\nOne important example is found in Thoreau, who famously explained his\nact of disobedience by tax resistance as follows:\n\n\nIn fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after my fashion,\nthough I will still make what use and get what advantage of her I can,\nas is usual in such cases. (Thoreau 1849 [1937: 687])\n\n\nThoreau\u2019s disobedience is principled. He recognizes that a\ndeclaration of war against the state is a criminal act. He willingly\ngoes to jail. But he also admits that he will cooperate with the state\nin other cases\u2014since there is something advantageous about\ncooperation. This indicates the complexity of the question of\ncooperation, protest, and disobedience. Thoreau\u2019s essay,\n\u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d (1849), is often viewed as an\nanarchist manifesto. Kropotkin discussed him as an anarchist\n(Kropotkin 1927 [2002]). And Tolstoy admired his act of civil\ndisobedience\u2014as did Gandhi.\n\nAnarchists continue to discuss strategies and tactics of disobedience.\nOne problem throughout this discussion is the degree to which\ndisobedience is effective. If there were to be successful anarchist\ncampaigns of disobedience they would have to be organized and\nwidespread. Whether such campaigns would actually work to disassemble\nthe state apparatus remains an open question.\n\nUntil their dreamed-of revolution comes, anarchist must consider the\ndegree to which cooperation with the state involves \u201cselling\nout\u201d to the political status quo. Perhaps there are reforms and\nshort-term gains that can be obtained through traditional political\nmeans: voting, lobbying legislators, etc. But anarchists have often\nheld to an all-or-nothing kind of approach to political participation.\nWe noted above that the Christian anarchist Jacques Ellul has said\nthat he does not vote because anarchy implies conscientious objection.\nBut herein lies a strategic conundrum. If progressively minded\nanarchists opt out of the political system, this means that less\nenlightened policies will prevail. By not voting or otherwise engaging\nin ordinary politics, the anarchist ends up with a system that he or\nshe will be even less happy with than if he or she had actively\nparticipated in the system.\n\nThis is, really, a problem of revolution versus reform. The\nrevolutionary wants revolution now, believing that it will occur by\nway of direct action of various sorts. Perhaps the revolutionary is\nalso thinking that the psychological, cultural, and spiritual\nevolution toward revolutionary consciousness can only occur when\ndirect action is taken: in order for anarchism to emerge, the\nanarchist may think, one ought to behave and think like an anarchist.\nBut without a concerted and nation-wide revolution, revolutionary\naction begins to look like mere selfishness, Epicurean opting out, or\nwhat Bookchin criticized as \u201clifestyle anarchism\u201d.\nMeanwhile those reform-minded folks who work within the system of\npolitical power and legality can end up supporting a system that they\nhave doubts about. This philosophical problem of reform vs. revolution\nexists for all radical political agendas. But the problem is\nespecially acute for anarchists, since anarchism is often an\nall-or-none proposition: if the state is justified then gradualism and\nreformism make sense; but if no state can be justified, then what is\nsometimes called \u201creformist anarchism\u201d is a non-starter\n(see L. Davis 2012).\n3.3. Utopian Communities and Non-Revolutionary Anarchism\n\nMany anarchists are revolutionaries who want change to be created\nthrough direct action. But given our preceding discussion of violence,\ndisobedience, and the potential for success of revolutionary activity,\nthe question arises about opting-out of political life. The Epicureans\nand Cynics pointed in this direction. The history of anarchism is\nreplete with efforts to construct anarchist communes that are\nindependent and separated from the rest of state centered political\nlife.\n\nWe might pick up the history here with the Christian anarchists and\npacifists of the Reformation: the Mennonites, for example; or the\nQuakers who refused to doff their hats for political authorities and\nwho sought a refuge in Pennsylvania. Indeed, there is an anarchist\nthread to the colonization of North America, as those who were\ndisgruntled with European political and religious hierarchy left for\nthe \u201cnew world\u201d or were forced out by the European\nauthorities. In the Seventeenth Century, Anne Hutchinson was cast out\nof the Massachusetts Bay Colony and forced to found a new community,\nwhen she concluded that the idea of government was flawed. Hutchinson\nis considered as one of the first anarchists of North America (see\nStringham 2007). Separatist communities were founded by the New\nEngland abolitionists and transcendentalists, by Josiah Warren, and by\nothers.\n\nAnarchist communes were formed in Europe during the Nineteenth Century\nand in Spain during the 1930s. There have been ongoing movements and\norganizations of indigenous peoples and others who inhabit the margins\nof mainstream political life. In the 1960s and 70s, anarchist\nseparatism was reiterated in the Hippy communes and attempts to live\noff the grid and get back to nature. Alternative communes, squats, and\nspontaneous gatherings continue to occur.\n\nSeparatist communities have to consider: the degree to which they give\nup on anarchist direct action against dominant political forces, the\nextent to which they have to accommodate themselves to political\nreality, and the risk that customary hierarchies will be reinstated\nwithin the commune. For the revolutionary anarchist, separatism is a\nstrategy of avoidance that impedes political action. Separatist\ncommunes must often obey the rules of the dominant political\norganization in order to trade and get connected to the rest of the\nworld. Finally, a complaint made about separatist communes is that\nthey can end up being structured by sexist, classist, and other\nhierarchical organizing principles. One might argue that until the\ndominant culture is revolutionized, separatism will only be a pale\nreflection of the anarchist ideal. And yet, on the other hand,\nadvocates of separatism will argue that the best way for anarchist\nideals to take hold is to demonstrate that they work and to provide an\ninspiration and experimental proving ground for anarchism.\n\nIf revolutionary activity is taken off the table, then anarchists are\nleft with various forms of gradualism and reformism. One way this\nmight occur is through the creation of \u201ctemporary autonomous\nzones\u201d such as those described by Bey. Along these lines David\nGraeber provides a description of the cultural and spiritual work that\nwould be required in order to prepare the way for anarchist\nrevolution. Graeber says that this would require \u201cliberation in\nthe imaginary\u201d, by which he means that through activism, utopian\ncommunities, and the like there can be a gradual change in the way\npolitical power is imagined and understood (Graeber 2004).\nRevolutionary anarchists will respond to this by arguing that\nliberation in the imaginary is simply imaginary liberation: without\nactual change in the status quo, oppression and inequality continue to\nbe a problem.\n4. Objections and Replies\n\nLet\u2019s conclude by considering some standard objections to\nanarchism and typical replies.\n4.1 Anarchism is Nihilistic and Destructive\n\nObjection: This objection holds that anarchism is\nmerely another name for chaos and for a rejection of order. This\nobjection holds that anarchists are violent and destructive and that\nthey are intent on destroying everything, including morality\nitself.\n\nReply: This objection does not seem to recognize that\nanarchists come in many varieties. Many anarchists are also\npacifists\u2014and so do not advocate violent revolution. Many other\nanarchists are firmly committed to moral principles such as autonomy,\nliberty, solidarity, and equality. Some anarchists do take their\ncritique of arch\u00e9 in a nihilistic direction that\ndenies ethical principles. But one can be committed to anarchism,\nwhile advocating for caring communities. Indeed, many of the main\nauthors in the anarchist tradition believed that the state and the\nother hierarchical and authoritarian structures of contemporary\nsociety prevented human flourishing.\n4.2 Anarchy Will Always Evolve Back into the State\n\nObjection: This objection holds that anarchism is\ninherently unstable. Hobbes and other early modern social contract\ntheories maintain that the state emerges as a necessary response to\nnatural anarchy which keeps order and protects our interests. A\ndifferent theory comes from Nozick, who argues that the\n\u201cnight-watchman state\u201d would emerge out of anarchy by an\ninvisible hand process: as people will exercise their liberty and\npurchase protection from a protection agency, which would eventually\nevolve into something like a minimal state.\n\nReply: Anarchists may argue that the state of nature\nis simply not a state of war and so that Hobbes\u2019s description is\nfalse. Some anarcho-primitivists will argue that things were much\nbetter for human beings in the original state of nature in small\ncommunities living close to the land. Other anarchists might argue\nthat the disadvantages of state organizations\u2014the creation of\nhierarchies, monopolies, inequalities, and the like\u2014simply\noutweigh the benefits of state structures; and that rational agents\nwould choose to remain in anarchy rather than allow the state to\nevolve. Some anarchists may argue that each time a state emerges, it\nwould have to be destroyed. But others will argue that education and\nhuman development (including technological development) would prevent\nthe reemergence of the state.\n4.3 Anarchism is Utopian\n\nObjection: This objection holds that there simply is\nno way to destroy or deconstruct the state. So exercises in anarchist\npolitical theory are fruitless. It would be better, from this point of\nview to focus on critiques of hierarchy, inequality, and threats to\nliberty from within liberal or libertarian political theory\u2014and\nto engage in reforms that occur within the status quo and mainstream\npolitical organization.\n\nReply: Ideal theory is always in opposition to\nnon-ideal theory. But utopian speculation can be useful for clarifying\nvalues. Thus philosophical anarchism may be a useful exercise that\nhelps us understand our values and commitment, even though political\nanarchism has no hope of succeeding. Furthermore, there are examples\nof successful anarchist communities on a small local scale (for\nexample, in the separatist communities discussed above). These\nconcrete examples can be viewed as experiments in anarchist theory and\npractice.\n4.4 Anarchism is Incoherent\n\nObjection: This objection holds that a political\ntheory that abolishes political structures makes no sense. A related\nconcern arises when anarchism is taken to be a critique of authority\nin every case and in all senses. If anarchists deny then that there\ncan be any arch\u00e9 whatsoever, then the claim\ncontradicts itself: we would have a ruling theory that states that\nthere is no ruling theory. This sort of criticism is related to\nstandard criticisms of relativism and nihilism. Related to this is a\nmore concrete and mundane objection that holds that there can be no\nanarchist movement or collective action, since anarchism is\nconstitutionally opposed to the idea of a movement or collective\n(since under anarchism there can be no authoritative ruler or set of\nrules).\n\nReply: This objection only holds if anarchism is\ntaken to be an all-or-nothing theory of the absolutist variety.\nPolitical anarchists do not necessarily agree with the skeptical\npost-foundationalist critique which holds that there can be no ruling\nprinciple or authority whatsoever. Rather, political anarchists hold\nthat there are legitimate authorities but that political power quickly\nloses its authoritativeness and legitimacy. Furthermore, anarchists\ntend to advocate for a principle and procedure for organization based\nupon voluntarism and mutual aid, as well as unanimity and/or\nconsensus. From this point of view anarchist communities can work very\nwell, provided that they avoid coercive authority. To support this\npoint anarchists will point to historical examples of successful\nanarchist communes. They will also point to ordinary human\nrelations\u2014in families and civil society relationship\u2014which\noperate quite well apart form coercive and hierarchical political\nauthority\n4.5 Philosophical Anarchism is \u201cToothless\u201d\n\nObjection: One objection to philosophical anarchism\nof the sort discussed throughout this essay is that it remains merely\ntheoretical. Some political anarchists have little patience for\nabstract discourses that do not engage in direct action. One worry\nabout philosophical anarchism is that in failing to act\u2014and in\nfailing to take responsibility for the actions that ought to follow\nfrom thought\u2014philosophical anarchism remains a bourgeois\nconvenience that actually serves the status quo. Thus when\nphilosophical anarchists remain uncommitted in terms of the concrete\nquestions raised by anarchism\u2014whether they should obey the law,\nwhether they should vote, and so on\u2014they tend to support the\ninterests of defenders of the status quo.\n\nReply: In response to this objection, one might\ndefend the importance of philosophical reflection. It is important to\nbe clear about principles and ideas before taking action. And with\nanarchism the stakes are quite high. The puzzles created by\nphilosophical anarchism are profound. They lead us to question\ntraditional notions of sovereignty, political obligation, and so on.\nThey lead us to wonder about cultural and ethical conventions,\nincluding also our first principles regarding the theory and\norganization of social life. Given the difficulty of resolving many of\nthese questions, the philosophical anarchist may hold that caution is\nin order. Moreover, the philosophical anarchist might also defend the\nimportance of wonder. The anarchist critique gives us reason to wonder\nabout much that we take for granted. Wonder may not change the world\nin immediate ways or lead to direct action. But wonder is an important\nstep in the direction of thoughtful, ethical action.\n",
