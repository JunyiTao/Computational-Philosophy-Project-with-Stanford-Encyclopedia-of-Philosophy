    "main_text": "Subject Matter and Methodology || Methodology\n1.2 Methodology\n\nThe methodology of phenomenological inquiry is first-personal.\nHowever, as noted at the outset of this section, the two\ntraditions\u2014analytic and Phenomenological\u2014differ\nfundamentally. The former is an empirically grounded, a\nposteriori philosophical science that proceeds by inductive and\nabductive methods. It aims to achieve general, psychological truths\nabout the first-personal character of moral experiences. The latter is\nan a priori philosophical science that proceeds via a\nsystematic consideration of the various parts and aspects of an\nexperience in order to identify which of them are essential to the\nexperience being the kind of experience it is. It achieves\n(presumptively) necessary truths about the correlation between the\nintentionally directed experience and its object just as experienced\n(see below), including the first-personal character of its\nexperiential dimension and the structural components of the object and\nits significance for the subject. Let us consider these differences in\nmore detail.\n\nPhenomenological inquiry in the analytic tradition relies on\nintrospection as the basis for observing aspects of one\u2019s moral\nexperience, which can then be used for making psychological\ngeneralizations about such experience. Here, it is important to\ndistinguish two uses of introspectionist methodology. One use is\ndirect: one attends to some aspect of one\u2019s ongoing experience\nin order to describe what one observes. By turning one\u2019s\nattention inward, as it were, one can attend to the pain in\none\u2019s thumb and describe it as, say, dull or sharp. Likewise, by\nattending to one\u2019s occurrent emotional experience, one can\nimmediately determine that one is experiencing anger directed toward\nsome wrongful behavior one just witnessed.\n\nHowever, this use of introspection is of limited value when it comes\nto addressing certain philosophical controversies. One such\ncontroversy in the philosophy of perception is whether visual\nperceptual experiences have \u201crich contents\u201d. According to\na rich content view, visual experiences can and often do present the\ninstantiation in perceptual awareness not just of lower-level physical\nproperties such as colors, shapes, illumination, and motion, but also\nsuch experiences can and typically do also present the instantiation\nof higher-level properties including, for instance, properties that\ncategorize objects (cars, cacti, clouds), actions (starting a car,\nplanting a cactus, pointing to a cloud) and causal relations. But as\nSusanna Siegel (2011: chap. 3), a defender of the rich content view,\npoints out, the controversy over this view cannot be settled by the\ndirect use of introspection; one cannot reliably tell just by\nattending carefully to one\u2019s visual experience whether its\nperceptual contents are rich. But this does not mean that\nintrospection is of no use. Rather, it figures importantly in\nphenomenal contrast arguments. There is a variety of such arguments\nthat differ importantly in their probative power that need not concern\nus\n here.[7]\n Generally speaking, such arguments draw a conclusion about the\nphenomenal character of a certain type of experience, by appealing to\na phenomenal difference of some sort between two experiences being\ncompared. For example, in defending the claim that visual experiences\npresent one with object kinds, Siegel contrasts one\u2019s visual\nexperience of pine trees, situated among other trees in a forest,\nbefore acquiring the disposition to easily recognize pine trees, with\none\u2019s visual experience of the forest after acquiring the\ndisposition. Siegel points to a \u201cfeeling of familiarity\u201d\nin one\u2019s overall phenomenology in the second experience that is\nsalient to introspection. This introspectable difference figures in a\npremise in an abductive argument (i.e., inference to the best\nexplanation) for the claim that one\u2019s visual experience after\ngaining the appropriate recognitional disposition includes the\npresentation of pine tree, an instance supporting the rich content\nview, which then generalizes to a wide range of visual experiences.\nIntrospection plays an ineliminable role in phenomenal contrast\narguments. However, at least as employed by Siegel in defending the\nrich content view, its use is to reveal something reliably detectable\nabout one\u2019s contrasting experiences, which can then provide the\nbasis for an argument to a conclusion about phenomenal character.\n\nTurning for a moment to moral experience, one controversy (which we\ndiscuss below in\n section 2),\n is whether certain types of moral perceptual experience purport to\npresent instantiated moral properties. If so, and if one takes such\nexperience to bear on philosophical disputes over moral metaphysics,\nthen one can appeal to such experiences as providing presumptive\nevidence for some form of moral realism. Suppose, though, that one\ncannot reliably tell by directly introspecting one\u2019s moral\nexperiences whether they have such realist purport. One might then\nhope to provide evidence that such experiences do have such purport by\nemploying a phenomenal contrast argument.\n\nOf course, there are important questions about the nature and\nreliability of introspectionist methodology. (We refer readers to the\nentries on introspection and on self-knowledge for relevant\ndiscussions.) The important points for present purposes are these.\nFirst, the role introspection plays in addressing\nphilosophical disputes may vary, the basic division being between\ndirect methods and the method that employs phenomenal contrast\narguments. Second, the uses of introspection in the analytic tradition\nare intended to yield empirically grounded psychological claims about\nthe phenomenal character of moral experiences, employing, inductive\nand abductive methods. As we have already noted, this empirically\ngrounded methodology and its aims differ sharply from the methods and\naims one finds in the Phenomenological tradition to which we now\nturn.\n\nThe methodology of Phenomenology as initiated by Husserl involves\nthree key aspects: (1) a specification of the main theme for\nphenomenological reflection, namely, intentionality (the feature of\nexperience whereby it is directed upon an object); (2) a description\naimed at revealing the necessary constituents of the correlation\nbetween intentionally directed experiences and their objects just as\nexperienced, that is, in their significance for the subject , and (3)\na methodology involving imaginative variation, governed by a\nwhole-part logic, of the parts and aspects of the correlation.\n\nThe specification of the main theme of phenomenology as intentionality\nis a result of exercising the \u201cphenomenological reduction\u201d\n(Husserl 1913: \u00a7\u00a730\u201384). Without entering into the\nvarious debates about the possibility, extent, and significance of the\nreduction\u2014all of which are disputed\u2014the minimal sense of\nthe reduction common to Phenomenologists is the suspension of\none\u2019s participation in the belief in the existence of the world\n(and the objects therein), a belief characteristic of our\nstraightforward, everyday experience of the world. Husserl (1913:\n\u00a731) also uses the term \u201cbracketing\u201d in speaking of\nthe reduction, and this provides a useful metaphor. Just as absolute\ntwo, represented as [2], is the number two without a positive or\nnegative index, the reduced experience\u2014say, [perceiving the\ntable]\u2014is the experience along with its object as meant, as\nsignificant for us in a particular manner, without the index of\nexistence or non-existence. Some Phenomenologists (e.g., Scheler\n1913/1916) reject the deployment of the reduction because they wish to\npreserve a strong realism regarding the existence of values, and they\nbelieve the reduction commits one to a form of metaphysical\nidealism.\n\nAlternatively and more generally, we can say the reduction focuses\nattention upon the object intended in experience simply as\nexperienced. Either formulation captures the correlation of experience\nand its object. The reduction, in other words, is a reflective turn\nthat leads our attention away from the object as given in everyday\nexperience back (re-ducere) to the correlation\u2014what we\ncall the \u201cintentional correlation\u201d\u2014between the\nexperience intending the object and the object just in the manner it\nis experienced. It leads our attention back to the experiences in\nwhich objects have meaning for us. At the same time, the reduction\nreveals the correlational inseparability of the phenomenal content\nproper to the experiential, subjective side of the correlation and the\nintentional content proper to the objective side of the\n correlation.[8]\n\nThe second and third aspects of the Phenomenological method are joined\nin the idea of descriptive analysis carried out in terms of a\nwhole-part logic that (1) identifies the parts or aspects of the\nexperience, its object, and the correlation itself, and (2)\nimaginatively varies the whole by thinking away different parts or\naspects of the whole to determine which of them must be\npresent for the experience or object to remain the kind of experience\nor object that it is. Stated more formally, imaginative variation\nsystematically varies the whole under consideration (W) by\ntrying to imagine it first without part A, then without part\nB, then without part C, and so forth. If W\ncan be imagined without part A and still be considered a\nW, then A is a \u201cpiece\u201d that does not\nbelong necessarily and universally to Ws. If, by contrast,\nW cannot be imagined without part B, then B\nis a \u201cmoment\u201d of W and belongs necessarily and\nuniversally to Ws. The existence of any W entails\nthe presence of B (Husserl 1900\u20131901 [2001:\n2:5\u20137]). The deployment of this methodology yields a\npriori truths regarding the necessary and universal features of\nthe intentionality proper to different kinds of experiences.\n\nThe inability to imagine the separate existence of a moment is not\nmerely a psychological limitation of the human imagination. It is\ninstead a rational inability to separate specific logical (conceptual)\ncontents from one another. The necessity of moments supplementing and\ncomplementing one another in the formation of a whole arises out of a\nnecessity in the nature of the things themselves, a necessity in the\nsense of the moments themselves (Husserl 1900\u20131901 [2001:\n2:11]). Consider, for example, the moral emotion of guilt: guilt\ninvolves distressing feelings about something one has done and knows\nor thinks to be wrong. If one tries to think away the feelings of\ndistress, one would not recognize the emotion as guilt, and if one\ntries to think away the knowledge or thought that what one did was\nwrong, one would again not recognize the emotion as guilt. Feelings of\ndistress and the recognition of wrongdoing are moments of\u2014that\nis, essential to\u2014guilt.\n\nThe majority of Phenomenologists do not engage in the kind of detailed\nmethodological reflections that Husserl did. However, virtually all\nPhenomenologists employ something like the minimal notion of the\nphenomenological turn to the intentional correlation as the whole that\nis under investigation and seek to identify the essential constituents\nof experience and its objects as experienced. Moreover, virtually all\nPhenomenologists utilize an analysis of whole-part relations, even if\nthey do not use the terms, in order to discover essential features of\nthe correlation itself, as well as of its experiential and objective\nmoments. Since the whole under investigation is not a psychological\nsubject\u2014that is, a particular worldly subject\u2014but any\npossible subject, and since the method discloses necessary and\nuniversal structures that make the experiences the kind of experience\nthey are, the result is an a priori Phenomenology.\n",
