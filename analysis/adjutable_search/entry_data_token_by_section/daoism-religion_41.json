    "main_text": "Meditation || Contemplation\n9.4 Contemplation\n\nFrom approximately the 7th century, the meditation\npractices outlined above were largely replaced by methods of\ncontemplation and introspection (Kohn 2010). While their closeness to\nBuddhism is manifest, their roots also lie in early teachings and\npractices such as those described in the Neiye (Internal\nTraining), dating from the second half of the 4th\ncentury BCE (Kirkland 2004: 39\u201352; Roth 1999; Graziani 2001),\nand in the above-mentioned speech of Guangcheng\nzi to the Yellow Emperor (Zhuangzi, ch. 11; Watson 1968:\n118\u201320).\n\nOne of the main sources on contemplation (guan) methods is\nthe Neiguan jing (Book of Inner Contemplation; Kohn 2010:\n179\u201387), another text spoken by Laozi in his deified aspect.\nThis work emphasizes that the original state of clarity and purity is\nlost when the mind is overcome by passions and attachments caused by\nsensual cravings. When the mind is stabilized, disordered thoughts do\nnot arise; one then does not only reach the state of quiescence, but\nthe state in which both movement and quiescence are transcended.\n\nThe Qingjing jing (Book of Clarity and Quiescence; Kohn 1993:\n24\u201329) is another influential work, also dating from the Tang\nperiod and also spoken by Laozi. It states that the innate clarity and\nquiescence of the mind and the spirit are defiled by passion and lust\nowed to the separation of original Unity into the two complementary\nprinciples. Only by realizing that mind, forms, and individual objects\nare devoid of an underlying nature is it possible to awaken to their\nfundamental emptiness. This is attained by contemplation, and leads\none to the recovery of the \u201cclarity and quiescence\u201d\nmentioned in the title (an expression derived from the Daode\njing, sec. 45). Among the main uses of this work was, and still\nis, its daily recitation by Quanzhen monks, nuns, and adepts.\n",
