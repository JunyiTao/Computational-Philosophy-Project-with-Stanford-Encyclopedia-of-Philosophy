    "main_text": "\n\nOn standard views, logic has as one of its goals to characterize (and\ngive us practical means to tell apart) a peculiar set of truths, the\nlogical truths, of which the following English sentences are examples\nstandardly taken as paradigmatic:\n\n(1)  If death is bad\nonly if life is good, and death is bad, then life is good.\n\n(2)  If no desire is\nvoluntary and some beliefs are desires, then some beliefs are not\nvoluntary.\n(3)  If Drasha is a cat\nand all cats are mysterious, then Drasha is mysterious.\n\n\nAs it turns out, it is very hard to think of universally accepted\nideas about what the generic properties of logical truths are or\nshould be. A widespread, perhaps universally accepted idea is that\npart of what should distinguish logical truths from other kinds of\ntruths is that logical truths should have a yet to be fully understood\nmodal force. It is typical to hold that, in some sense or senses of\n\u201ccould\u201d, a logical truth could not be false or,\nalternatively, that in some sense or senses of \u201cmust\u201d, a\nlogical truth must be true. But there is little if any agreement about\nhow the relevant modality should be understood.\n\nAnother widespread idea is that part of what should distinguish\nlogical truths is that they should be in some sense yet to be fully\nunderstood \u201cformal\u201d. That a logical truth is formal\nimplies at the very least that all the sentences which are appropriate\nreplacement instances of its logical form are logical truths too. In\nthis context, the logical form of a sentence \\(S\\) is supposed to be a\ncertain schema determined uniquely by \\(S\\), a schema of which \\(S\\)\nis a replacement instance, and of which sentences with the same form\nas \\(S\\) are replacement instances too. A form has at the very least\nthe property that the expressions in it which are not schematic\nletters (the \u201clogical expressions\u201d) are widely applicable\nacross different areas of discourse. Among people who accept the idea\nof formality there would be wide agreement that the forms of (1), (2)\nand (3) would be something like \\((1')\\), \\((2')\\) and \\((3')\\)\nrespectively:\n\n\\((1')\\)  If \\(a\\) is\n\\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is \\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is \\(Q\\).\n\n\\((2')\\)  If no \\(Q\\)\nis \\(R\\) and some \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\)s, then some \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\).\n\n\\((3')\\)  If \\(a\\) is a\n\\(P\\) and all \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\), then \\(a\\) is \\(Q\\). \n\n\n\\((1')\\), \\((2')\\) and \\((3')\\) do seem to give rise to sentences that\nintuitively must be true for all appropriate replacements of the\nletters \u201c\\(a\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(P\\)\u201d,\n\u201c\\(Q\\)\u201d, and \u201c\\(R\\)\u201d. And expressions such as\n\u201cif\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201csome\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, etc., which are paradigmatic logical expressions,\ndo seem to be widely applicable across different areas of discourse.\nBut the idea that logical truths are or should be formal is certainly\nnot universally accepted. And even among those who accept it, there is\nlittle if any agreement about what generic criteria determine the form\nof an arbitrary\n sentence.[1]\n\nA remarkable fact about logical truth is that many have thought it\nplausible that the set of logical truths of certain rich formalized\nlanguages is characterizable in terms of concepts of standard\nmathematics. In particular, on some views the set of logical truths of\na language of that kind is always the set of sentences of the language\nderivable in a certain calculus. On other, more widespread views, the\nset of logical truths of a language of that kind can be identified\nwith the set of sentences that are valid across a certain range of\nmathematical interpretations (where validity is something related to\nbut different from the condition that all the sentences that are\nreplacement instances of its form be true too; see below, section\n2.3). One main achievement of early mathematical logic was precisely\nto show how to characterize notions of derivability and validity in\nterms of concepts of standard mathematics. (Sections 2.2 and 2.3 give\na basic description of the standard mathematically characterized\nnotions of derivability and validity for standard quantificational\nlanguages, with references to other entries.)\n\nIn part 1 of this entry we will describe in very broad outline the\nmain existing views about how to understand the ideas of modality and\nformality relevant to logical truth. (A more detailed treatment of\nthese views is available in other entries mentioned below, and\nespecially in the entries on the\n analytic/synthetic distinction\n and\n logical constants.)\n In part 2 we will describe, also in outline, a particular set of\nphilosophical issues that arise when one considers the attempted\nmathematical characterizations of logical truth. The question of\nwhether or in what sense these characterizations are correct is bound\nwith the question of what is or should be our specific understanding\nof the ideas of modality and\n formality.[2]\n",
