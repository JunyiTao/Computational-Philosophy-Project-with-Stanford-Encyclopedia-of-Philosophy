    "main_text": "Philosophy || Philosophy of Religion\n3.4 Philosophy of Religion\n\nScud\u00e9ry develops her philosophy of religion through two\nprincipal strategies. Positively, she argues that God\u2019s\nexistence can be demonstrated through the philosophical use of reason.\nShe favors a cosmological argument from design. Negatively, she\ncriticizes the religious skepticism of salon libertines as irrational.\nTheir dismissal of theological claims to truth is incoherent with\ntheir avid acceptance of many weaker claims to truth in the secular\ndomain.\n\nGod\u2019s existence can be known through a rational scrutiny of the\ncosmos, which ultimately reveals itself to be the handiwork of a\nsupreme being. The Neo-Epicurean argument that the cosmos\u2019s\nexistence and design can be explained through the random play of\nphysical atoms is untenable, since purely physical substances cannot\ncreate the elaborate laws which govern the universe. Moreover, matter\ncannot create the spirit which is obviously operative in human actions\nof intellect and will. \n\n\nI strongly believe that undepraved human reason can and must know God\nthrough his works and that one can never reasonably think that these\nalleged Atoms\u2014which they are called in order to gain reverence\nfor them\u2014could create the eternal principles of the universe.\n[MM, 1: 432] \n\n\nTypically, Scud\u00e9ry argues that moral defect (depravity) could\nblind someone to God\u2019s existence. Authentic recognition of God\nentails moral judgment, repentance, and conversion. The superficial\nthought of materialists has failed to employ the higher reason of\nmetaphysics in determining the ultimate cause of the existence of the\nphysical and moral worlds. Like moral defect, defective reason can\nprevent someone from recognizing God\u2019s existence.\n\nThe strongest argument for God\u2019s existence is found in the\ndesign of the universe and of the human person. The complex and\nintelligent structure of the physical cosmos and of the human soul can\nonly be explained by the action of a supreme being who possesses\ndivine attributes. \n\n\nHow then can it happen that when human beings consider the admirable\nstructure of the universe and the admirable structure of themselves,\nthey are not inclined to believe they have been created by an\nintelligent, eternal, omnipotent, and unchangeable Being? This Being\nmerits all of our admiration. [MM, 1: 431] \n\n\nScud\u00e9ry suggests that the refusal to recognize God as the\nultimate cause of the exquisite structure of the physical universe and\nof the human person is incomprehensible. The refusal to recognize\nGod\u2019s existence in light of this supremely intelligent design\ncan only be explained by a mysterious willfulness.\n\nFor Scud\u00e9ry, the religious skepticism of the libertines in the\nperiod\u2019s salons merits little intellectual respect. Not only is\nthis skepticism generated by the moral license of the libertines; it\ncontrasts badly with the credulity they exhibit in other areas of\nknowledge. \n\n\nThe very people who don\u2019t want to believe in an invisible\nDivinity are very inclined, on the word of a few travelers, to tell\nunbelievable things, such as what they tell us about this marvelous\nstone\u2014called Heliotrope, I believe\u2014which Croesus possesses\namong his treasures and which they claim can make one invisible.\n[CDS, 1: 176] \n\n\nWhereas Christian revelation relies upon the inspired witness of\nScripture and Tradition, the tales of Croesus and other mythical\nfigures rely on the flimsiest hearsay. The libertine case for\nreligious skepticism rests on little more than a credulous,\ninconsistent reason allied with a moral depravity impervious to the\nevangelical call to repent.\n",
