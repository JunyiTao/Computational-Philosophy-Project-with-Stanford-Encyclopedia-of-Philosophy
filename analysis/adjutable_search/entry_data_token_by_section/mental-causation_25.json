    "main_text": "Problem IV: Externalism || Reasons as Structuring Causes\n7.3 Reasons as Structuring Causes\n\nAnother, much different, attempt to preserve a causal role for content\ncan be found in Dretske 1988, 1989, 1993. So far we\u2019ve assumed\nthat a behavioral event is distinct from the mental event that causes\nit. On Dretske\u2019s view, however, behavior is a process\nthat includes, as a component, its mental cause. When mental event\na causes bodily movement b, the behavior in this\ncase is not b itself, but the process of a\u2019s\ncausing b. When Lilian raises her hand because she wants to\nget the teacher\u2019s attention and she believes that raising her\nhand will accomplish this end, her behavior is not her hand\u2019s\ngoing up, but the process of this belief-desire pair\u2019s causing\nher hand to go up.\n\nDretske grants that when mental event a initiates\n(\u201ctriggers\u201d) a process ending in bodily movement\nb, a does so solely in virtue of its intrinsic\nmakeup. Nevertheless, a\u2019s relational, intentional\nproperties have a causal role, for they can be relevant to the\nfact that a causes b. Reasons are \u201cstructuring\ncauses\u201d of behavior: it\u2019s because of what a\nindicates that it was \u201crecruited\u201d during the learning\nprocess as a cause of b. (Indication here is a matter of\nreliable co-variation.) It\u2019s because, for example,\nLilian\u2019s belief indicates what it does\u2014raising one\u2019s\nhand (in these circumstances) is a way to get the teacher\u2019s\nattention\u2014that it was (together with the relevant desire)\nrecruited as a cause of her hand-raising. Relational, intentional\nmental properties thus become causally relevant to behavior, because\nthey are relevant to structuring the very causal processes that, on\nDretske\u2019s view, constitute instances of behavior.\n\nDretske\u2019s proposed solution quickly produced a number of\nresponses (e.g., Smith 1990; Block 1990; Baker 1991; Horgan 1991; Kim\n1991; Mele 1991). One question is whether relational, intentional\nproperties in fact play a causal role in the structuring (or\n\u201cwiring\u201d) of causal processes in the brain. Even during\nthe learning process, the states of Lilian\u2019s brain would seem to\nbe sensitive only to local, intrinsic features of one another,\nfeatures that screen off external goings-on. Dretske might be able to\navoid such screening-off by appealing to the counterfactual dependence\nof behavior-structuring on these goings-on. His view would then stand\nor fall with the success of counterfactual theories of causal\nrelevance (\u00a75.3). A second question is whether intentional\nstates, even if they were relevant in the way Dretske says they are,\ndeliver the kind of causal relevance we want. When Lilian raises her\nhand, the structuring of the relevant processes in her brain has\nalready occurred. If intentional properties are relevant at all, then,\nthey are apparently relevant only to what happened in the past during\nthe learning process. But we normally regard mental properties as\ncausally relevant to what\u2019s going on here and now, the very time\nwhen Lilian (or anyone) acts (but cf. Allen 1995; Dretske replies to\ncritics in his 1991, esp. pp. 210\u20137; for a more recent\ndiscussion see Hofmann and Schulte 2014).\n",
