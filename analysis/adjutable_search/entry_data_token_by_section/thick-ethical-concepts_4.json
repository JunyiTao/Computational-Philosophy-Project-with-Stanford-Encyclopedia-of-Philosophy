    "main_text": "Do Thick Concepts Have Distinctive Significance? || Reflection, Knowledge, and Priority\n2.3 Reflection, Knowledge, and Priority\n\nThick concepts and their relation to the thin bear also on knowledge\nin ethics. Bernard Williams famously claims that, unlike in science,\nin ethics \u201creflection can destroy knowledge\u201d (1985: 148;\nsee also Williams 1995). Thick terms and concepts are parochial, in\nthat they tend to have \u201cinterest\u201d or a \u201cpoint\u201d\nonly in the context of some particular evaluative outlooks or\npractices. The notion of lewdness as we know it really only has a life\nwithin a particular kind of sexual morality. That is why those who\nregard lewd as an objectionable term typically refrain from\nusing it. Industriousness seems to count as a positive quality only\nagainst some such evaluative frame as the Protestant work ethic.\n(Otherwise, what\u2019s the point?) This would explain why, as (D2)\nin the anti-disentangling argument claims, an unsympathetic outsider\nmight not be able to master the extensions that particular moral\ncommunities assign to their thick terms. Now consider what Williams\ncalls a \u201chypertraditional society\u201d: a maximally homogenous\nand minimally reflective society whose ethical reflection only employs\nthick concepts (Williams 1985: 142). Suppose T expresses one of\ntheir thick concepts in their language. And suppose that claims of the\nform x is T can express truths and qualify as\nknowledge (see also Williams 1995). Williams suggests that a judgment\ninvolving a thin concept such as good or bad\n\u201cis essentially the product of\nreflection\u201d (Williams 1985: 146). Since the hypertraditional\nsociety is unreflective, its members don\u2019t deploy good\nor bad. In that case we\ncannot suppose that T entails either. Now suppose a person from\nthe hypertraditional society has knowledge that x is T\nbut comes to reflect on her practices and acquires thin concepts. If\nthick concepts reflect social worlds, reflection that stands back from\nsocial practices must rely on thin concepts. Through reflection, the\nperson may come to reject her traditional way of life and the\nevaluative perspective that goes with it, inferring from x\nis T that x is bad. Or she may come to endorse it,\ninferring that x is okay. Williams suggests that \u201cwhen\nsomeone stands back from the practices of the society and its use of\nthese concepts and asks whether this is the right way to go on\u201d,\nthe sort of reflection that occurs \u201ccharacteristically disturbs,\nunseats, or replaces \u2026 traditional concepts\u201d (Williams\n1985: 146, 148). But if the person ceases to possess her traditional\nconcept T through thinly evaluative reflection, then presumably\nher previous knowledge that x is T is destroyed.\nWilliams\u2019s thinking rests on controversial assumptions about\nethical knowledge which we cannot pursue here. Nor can we pursue\nfascinating issues concerning the implications of being deprived of\ncertain concepts (Fricker 2007: ch. 7). Let\u2019s simply note that\nit isn\u2019t clear that losing traditional convictions through\nreflection leads to a loss of concepts. You might instead retain your\nconcepts shorn of their traditional evaluative trappings, and either\nfind them a new evaluative point (such as using what was a positive\nconcept negatively) or shelve those concepts as ones that have no\ndistinctive point or use in structuring your experience (Richard 2008:\n33; V\u00e4yrynen 2013: 123\u20135, 245). In the latter case the\nevaluative point of a thick concept wouldn\u2019t be constitutive of\nthe concept.\n\nAn important general issue about thick concepts is in the mix here\neither way. Consider the following widely accepted view about the\nrelation between thick and thin concepts:\n\n\nThin Centralism: Thin terms and concepts are conceptually\nand/or explanatorily prior to thick terms and concepts. (Hare 1952,\n1963, 1981; Blackburn 1992, 1998, 2013; Elstein and Hurka 2009; Smith\n2013)\n\n\nIf good and bad are\nconceptually prior to T, the members of a hypertraditional\nsociety cannot grasp T without also grasping them. But then\nthey cannot lose T when they draw a reflective inference from\nx is T to a thin evaluation. Similarly the\ntruth or falsity of x is T, and the status of\nits acceptance as knowledge, will depend partly on whether x is\ngood or bad. But these thin evaluative facts may be discernible to an\noutsider, thereby limiting the extent to which thick concepts resist\nmastery by those who cannot imaginatively inhabit the evaluative\noutlook within which it has a point. The same consequences would seem\nto follow from:\n\n\nNo Priority: Thick and thin terms and concepts are\nconceptually and explanatorily interdependent, with neither being\nprior to the other. (Hurley 1989: 13; Dancy 1995; Tappolet 2004)\n\n\nLike Thin Centralism, No Priority entails that one cannot grasp thick\nconcepts without grasping thin concepts. Thus it seems that Williams\nmust reject Thin Centralism and No Priority, and must instead accept\none of the following views about the relationship between thick and\nthin concepts:\n\n\nNon-Centralism: Thick and thin terms and concepts in general\nexhibit no interesting relations of conceptual and/or explanatory\npriority or interdependence. (V\u00e4yrynen 2013: 250)\n\nThick Centralism: Thick terms and concepts are conceptually\nand/or explanatorily prior to thin terms and concepts. (Explicit\nstatements are rare, but see Chappell 2013 and Annas 2016.)\n\n\nUnder Non-Centralism it might be difficult to explain why thin\nevaluative reflection should tend to lead to a loss of traditional\nthick concepts. Thick Centralism rules out Separability (see\n section 3),\n but note in addition that Williams needs a version of Thick\nCentralism on which the claim that grasping thin concepts requires\ngrasping specific thick concepts is compatible with the possibility of\nsubsequently losing those thick concepts through reflection that\ndeploys thin concepts. Regarding thick concepts in this way as a\nthrowaway ladder might not yield a stable form of Thick Centralism. An\nimportant potential implication of Thick Centralism is that since not\neveryone shares the same thick concepts, there might be no evaluative\nlanguage that is \u201cconceptually homogeneous\u201d across\ncultures or across disagreements within a culture (cf. Williams 1995).\nWilliams further argues that we can draw significant conclusions about\nthe nature of not just ethical knowledge but also of evaluative truths\nand their objectivity specifically from reflection on thick terms and\nconcepts, but these arguments are highly controversial (see Williams\n1985: 135\u20136, 146\u201355; Quinn 1987; Scheffler 1987; Williams\n1995; Lang 2001; Moore 2003; Kirchin 2017: ch. 172\u201380).\n\nFor a summary of some further questions about the significance of\nthick concepts, see\n section 1\n of the supplementary document\n \u201cAdditional Debates about Thick Concepts and Their Significance\u201d.\n\nAll these arguments regarding the distinctive significance of thick\nconcepts point us to the same cluster of issues: the combination\nquestion regarding how thick terms combine evaluation and\nnon-evaluative description, the location question regarding how the\nevaluations they may be used to convey relate to their meaning or\ncontent, and the delineation question regarding how thick terms and\nconcepts differ from the thin (and other evaluative terms).\nLet\u2019s now turn to consider these debates in their own right.\n",
