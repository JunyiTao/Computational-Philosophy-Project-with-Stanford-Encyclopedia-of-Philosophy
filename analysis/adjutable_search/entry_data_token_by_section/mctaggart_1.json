    "main_text": "McTaggart\u2019s Method of Metaphysics\n2. McTaggart\u2019s Method of Metaphysics\n\n\nAlthough McTaggart\u2019s early forays in metaphysics employed a\n\u201cHegelian\u201d dialectical method, McTaggart\u2019s most\nwell-known works proceed in a fashion that would be familiar to some\ncontemporary analytic metaphysicians.\n\nMcTaggart conducts metaphysics almost entirely from the armchair. In\nthe first chapter of Some Dogmas of Religion, McTaggart\ncharacterizes metaphysics as the systematic study of the ultimate\nnature of reality. He then argues that the empirical sciences, such as\nphysics, cannot replace metaphysical inquiry. The argument is roughly\nas follows. First, the claim that some empirical science such as\nphysics provides knowledge of ultimate reality is not itself a claim of\nphysics, but rather a metaphysical claim made about physics. And as\nsuch the evaluation of this claim goes beyond the province of physics.\nSecond, McTaggart claims that metaphysical materialists, dualists,\nBerkeleyian idealists, and Hegelians all accept the same system of\nscientific propositions, whilst differing amongst themselves on the\nissue of how these propositions are to be interpreted. McTaggart\nconcludes from this claim that there are metaphysical issues remaining\neven after we have settled on our best scientific theory.\n\nA similar conclusion is defended in chapter 3 of the first volume of\nThe Nature of Existence. McTaggart there raises the following\nworries about using \u2018inductive methods\u2019 to arrive at\nmetaphysical results. First, McTaggart claims that the rationality of\nusing induction in general is questionable. According to\nMcTaggart, we need an argument for the rationality of induction, and\nsuch an argument will not be an inductive argument. Second, McTaggart\nraises two specific worries about using inductive arguments to derive\nmetaphysical claims about reality as a whole. The first specific worry\nis that, since there is only one entity that is reality as a whole, we\ncannot use an inductive argument to determine the features of this\nentity. (McTaggart appears to conceive of inductive arguments as\nexemplifying the pattern there are many As and each observed A is\nF, so every A is F.) The second worry is that,\nsince there are infinitely many existing entities (a claim for which\nMcTaggart will argue for later in the Nature of Existence),\nand we observe only finitely many of them, any inductive argument\nmoving from claims about the features of what we observe to the\nfeatures of existent entities in general will be dubious.\n\nPerhaps McTaggart\u2019s skepticism about the usefulness of empirical\ninquiry for metaphysical investigations is why his twentieth-century\nworks are almost entirely devoid of commentary on the revolutions\noccurring in fundamental physics. (Einstein is mentioned exactly once\nin both volumes of The Nature of Existence, briefly and in\npassing in section 369 of the second volume.) Unlike some of his\nnear-contemporaries, such as A.N. Whitehead and Bertrand Russell,\nMcTaggart proceeds as if he were blithely unaware of the potential for\ninterplay between physics and\n philosophy.[7]\n\nMcTaggart by and large proceeds deductively by appealing to\npropositions he holds to be synthetic a priori and then deriving\nfurther claims from them. McTaggart does allow that experience has a\nrole to play in metaphysical inquiry, albeit a limited one.\nMcTaggart\u2019s The Nature of Existence explicitly appeals\nto two empirical claims, first that something exists and second that\nwhat exists is differentiated, i.e., has proper parts. McTaggart holds\nthat only the former claim is knowable only by experience; the latter\nclaim is derivable, he claims, from the synthetic a priori position\nthat everything has proper parts. This latter claim will be further\ndiscussed in sections 6 and 8 of this article.\n\nMoreover, McTaggart grants that the data provided by sense-perception\nare prima facie true. That is, if we seem to perceive P, then\nunless there are compelling a priori reasons or reasons\nderiving from other perceptions to believe ~P, we should\nbelieve P. This principle does real work in McTaggart\u2019s\nsystem. We apparently perceive that objects are ordered in time: some\nevents occur before others, whilst others are simultaneous. McTaggart\nholds that there is a powerful a priori argument that nothing\nis actually in time. (McTaggart\u2019s argument will be discussed in\nsection 6 of this article.) But there is no powerful argument that the\nobjects that are apparently ordered by temporal relations are not\nordered by some other (non-temporal) relation. Perception teaches\nus both that objects are in time and that they are ordered by some\nrelation. Only the former is called into question by McTaggart\u2019s\nargument against the reality of time. In this way, McTaggart arrives at\nthe question: what is the nature of the ordering relation that, in\nconjunction with other facts, gives rise to the appearance that the\nobjects which it orders are in time?\n\nWere McTaggart alive today, his (perhaps excessive) apriorism would\nprobably put off many of his analytic colleagues. But all of them would\nappreciate his strong desire to make his arguments as clear and as\nrigorous as he could make\n them.[8]\nG.E. Moore, who imbibed this philosophical\nvalue during his time at Cambridge, had this to say:\n\n\nHow clear he was, compared to the majority of philosophers. And what\nimmense pains he took to get clear, even if he did not always succeed.\n\u2026 I think it can fairly be said that what McTaggart was mainly\nengaged with was trying to find a precise meaning for Hegel\u2019s\nobscure utterances, and he did succeed in finding many things precise\nenough to be discussed: his own lectures were eminently clear. \u2026\nBut certainly Hegel never meant anything that precise! After\nthese two years in which I was obliged to read Hegel, I never thought\nit worth while to read him again; but McTaggart\u2019s own published\nworks I thought it worthwhile to study carefully\u2026. (Moore 1942,\n18\u201319)\n\n\nWhatever may be thought of these and other conclusions of\nMcTaggart\u2019s, and of the validity of his arguments for them, there\ncan, I think, be no question that in respect of ingenuity and subtlety,\nand above all, perhaps in respect of the clearness of his thought, he\nwas a philosopher of the very first rank. \u2026 Nor was it only\nthat McTaggart was naturally clear-headed in a very unusual degree: he\nspared no pains in trying to get clearer and clearer about all matters\nwhich seemed to him to be fundamental. Perhaps the most valuable lesson\nwhich his pupils learnt from him was the importance and difficulty of\ntrying to get quite clear as to what you hold, and of distinguishing\nbetween the good and bad reasons for holding it. (Moore 1925, 271)\n\n",
