    "main_text": "General Characterization of Carnap\u2019s Philosophy || Metaphysics\n1.4 Metaphysics\n\nWhy, under this pluralism, should some statements and expressions\nstill be excluded, as not having any content, as not\nconveying anything but as being just empty verbiage that purports to\nsay something significant? Why, that is, should\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d still be excluded, as Carnap notoriously\ninsisted? Surely the metaphysician is as free as anyone else to choose\nher language?\n\nThese questions take us back to the engineering ethos described in\n section 1.1\n above, about explication and rational reconstruction. Language\nchoice, for Carnap, was not an end in itself but was rather in the\nservice of freeing ourselves from the distorted perspective on the\nworld imposed on us by our inherited natural languages. These\nlanguages had not evolved to optimize the transparent representation\nof knowledge, but for very different, primitive practical purposes.\nFor the pursuit of knowledge, and insight into the human condition in\nthe light of that knowledge, better languages are needed. What makes a\nlanguage \u201cbetter\u201d? In principle Carnap leaves that open.\nEveryone has their own values about what they want languages to do for\nthem, and will choose accordingly. But Carnap\u2019s own values were\nthose of the Enlightenment. His value hierarchy placed the value of\nescaping from the complacent, passive acceptance of authority, or of\ntraditional or folk ideas\u2014and finding something objectively\nbetter\u2014near the top. The replacement of knowledge accepted\npassively from authority or tradition by objective knowledge was his\ngoal just as it had been the goal of the\nEncyclop\u00e9distes. And by \u201cobjective\u201d\nknowledge, Carnap meant essentially scientific and practical\nknowledge, just as they did.\n\nThis did not mean a rejection of the humanistic tradition, or of\ndimensions to values other than the scientific and\nengineering-oriented. Carnap took entirely for granted (so deeply that\nhe hardly ever bothered to make it explicit) that literature, art, and\nmusic shaped people\u2019s values and were closely connected with\nthem. But these were for individuals to negotiate. Since his\nexperience of the First World War, he had realized that the German\nintelligentsia\u2019s political indifference, its overindulgence in\nhumanistic individual values, had been partly to blame for the war. He\nhad resolved, therefore, to attend more to the framework that all\nhumans shared, and that formed the basis for their social and\npolitical cohabitation. Objective knowledge was, to him as to the\nEnlightenment, at the core of this shared framework. Practical\n(especially political) decisions should be informed ones,\narrived at in the light of the best possible knowledge about the\navailable choices and their consequences.\n\nMetaphysics was, in his view, a distraction from this program.\nMetaphysics was a kind of failed art form masquerading as knowledge,\nso it was both fake art and fake knowledge. Unlike a logical\nor mathematical proof or the confirmation of a scientific theory,\nmetaphysical proposals are unable to command widespread agreement;\neven the criteria by which they should be judged are often in\ndispute.\n\nOn the other hand, all of Carnap\u2019s repeated attempts, over\nseveral decades, to give a precise delineation\u2014to explicate the\ndistinction\u2014between scientific (or meaningful or communicatively\nadequate) statements and metaphysical (non-scientific, non-meaningful)\nones failed. He therefore became more liberal and less exacting about\nwhat was to be regarded as metaphysical. He was willing to allow that\nmany metaphysical theories of past philosophers (he cites Aristotle,\nLeibniz, Kant, Peirce, and Whitehead, among others) could be regarded\nas useful steps toward the construction of \u201cthe most general\nframeworks containing categorial concepts which are fundamental for\nthe representation of all knowledge\u201d, and moreover that he\nhimself regarded this task as among \u201cthe most important problems\nof philosophy\u201d (Carnap 1963b: 862). See the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Section 2 and 3)\n for further detail.\n",
