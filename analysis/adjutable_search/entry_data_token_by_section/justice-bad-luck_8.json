    "main_text": "Non-Separability of Luck and Effort\n9. Non-Separability of Luck and Effort\n\nA number of luck egalitarian accounts suggest that how much talent\npeople have is a matter of luck, whereas their levels of effort are\nnot. Metaphorically speaking, the first is a matter of the cards one\nhas been dealt, whereas the latter is a matter of how one chooses to\nplay them. To be sure, it will often be plausible to say that\none\u2019s present level of talent reflects past effort, and that\none\u2019s level of effort is a matter of good or bad luck (Rawls\n1971, 74). Partly for the sake of simplicity, and partly because the\nproblem about separability will arise whichever way we make the cut\nbetween luck and non-luck with regard to talents and efforts, let us\ninitially assume that while talents are wholly a matter of luck,\none\u2019s levels of effort are wholly a matter of non-luck.\nAccordingly, people who have different levels of talent, but the same\nlevel of effort should end up equally well off if we neutralize the\neffects of luck, whereas people who have the same levels of talent but\ndifferent levels of effort should end unequally well off. More\ngenerally, differences in effort should be reflected in differences in\nreward, but differences in talent should not. Under these assumptions\nwe can easily identify a luck-neutralizing distribution under the\nassumption of a constant sum of rewards in the following four-person\ncase:\n\nTable 1.\n\n\nActual level of talents\nActual level of efforts\nActual distribution of rewards\nLuck-neutralizing distribution of rewards \n\nAdam\nLow\nLow\n10\n17.5 \n\nBeatrice\nHigh\nHigh\n30\n22.5 \n\nClaude\nLow\nHigh\n20\n22.5 \n\nDorothy\nHigh\nLow\n20\n17.5 \n\n\nThis distribution neutralizes luck (not necessarily uniquely: there\nmay be other luck-neutralizing distributions). Adam and Dorothy, who\ndespite different levels of talent put in the same amount of effort,\nget the same level of reward. The same is true of Beatrice and Claude.\nBeatrice and Claude\u2019s levels of reward are higher than Adam and\nDorothy\u2019s, reflecting their higher level of effort.\n\nAssume next that level of effort is non-separable from level of\ntalent. That is, assume that if a group of people\u2019s levels of\ntalent had been different from what they actually are, so would their\nlevels of effort. Assume that in our four-person case above the facts\nare as follows:\n\nTable 2.\n\n\nActual level of talents\nActual level of efforts\nCounter-\n\nfactual level of talents\nCounter-\n\nfactual level of efforts\nActual distri-\n\nbution of rewards\nLuck-neutral-\n\nizing distri-\n\nbution of rewards \n\nAdam\nLow\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\n10\n? \n\nBeatrice\nHigh\nHigh\nLow\nLow\n30\n? \n\nClaude\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\n20\n? \n\nDorothy\nHigh\nLow\nLow\nLow\n20\n? \n\n\nIt no longer is clear which distribution neutralizes luck. Two\nresponses seem possible, both of which may have unattractive\nimplications.\n\nFirst, suppose we insist that counterfactual levels of effort are\nsimply irrelevant to luck-neutralization: ex hypothesi,\none\u2019s actual levels of effort are not a matter of luck, and a\nluck-neutralizing distribution should fit the distribution of actual\nefforts. This view may fail to capture the full range of\nluck-egalitarian intuitions. After all, Adam\u2014if for a moment we\ndisregard problems about knowledge and indeterminacy in counterfactual\nchoices (Hurley 2001, 66\u201369; Hurley 2003,\n164\u2013168)\u2014might correctly say that his case is identical to\nBeatrice\u2019s, and that he was merely unlucky not to be talented.\nAnd given that the cause of their putting in different levels of\neffort is simply a matter of luck, how can Beatrice\u2019s higher\nlevel of effort justify a higher level of reward for her? In not being\ntalented, Adam may have suffered from bad circumstantial luck. That is\nto say, the circumstances in which he decided on his levels of\neffort\u2014his particular skills not being much in demand\u2014may\nhave ensured that those decisions were less prudent than they would\nhave been in different contexts. Alternatively, Adam may have suffered\nfrom bad constitutive luck in that he could have been differently\nconstituted, and had he been so he would have made greater effort.\n\nSecond, we might say that actual as well as counterfactual levels of\neffort matter (compare Zimmerman 1993, 226). Rewards should match\naverage effort across different possible worlds. Since Claude\u2019s\nlevels of effort are high whatever his level of talent,\nDorothy\u2019s are low whatever her level of talent, and Adam\u2019s\nand Beatrice\u2019s levels of effort varies with their level of\ntalent, a luck-neutralizing distribution would leave Claude best off,\nAdam and Beatrice second-best off, and Dorothy worst off. The problem\nnow is that people who actually make the same efforts, i.e., Adam and\nDorothy and Beatrice and Claude, are rewarded differently. Beatrice\nmight complain that her level of effort is as high as Claude\u2019s,\nand yet he gets rewarded more\u2014and he does so, moreover, not\nsolely as a consequence of how he actually conducted himself, but\npartly as a result of how he would have conducted himself had his\nlevel of talent been different from what it in fact is. When we focus\non thick, responsibility control luck or thick, responsibility choice\nluck, it becomes unclear whether this is the right way to neutralize\nluck. For, on many accounts of responsibility, what I am responsible\nfor depends on properties of the actual sequence of events and not on\nwhat I would have done in some counterfactual sequence of events in\nwhich my personality differs from the way it actually is. It appears\nthat, to reconcile such thick accounts of luck with neutralizing luck\non the basis of counterfactual levels of effort, we would need to\nendorse a regressive conception of responsibility on which to be\nresponsible for something one has to be responsible for its causes.\nThis would solve the problem of accounting for which distribution\nneutralizes luck in that, as argued above, it now seems that the only\ndistribution that neutralizes luck is an equal one. However, it would\nalso prevent luck-egalitarians from claiming that people with\ndifferent levels of talent should be rewarded differently. Hence,\nwhile the non-separability of talent and effort does not refute\nluck-egalitarianism, two ways of resolving the issues it raises\ngenerate further problems (see also Elford 2017b; Miller 2014).\n",
