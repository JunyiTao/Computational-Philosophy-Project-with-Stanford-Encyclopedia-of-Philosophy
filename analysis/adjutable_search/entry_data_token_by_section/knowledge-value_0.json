    "main_text": "Value problems\n1. Value problems\n\nIn Plato\u2019s Meno, Socrates raises the question of why\nknowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. Call this the\nMeno problem or, anticipating distinctions made below, the\nprimary value problem.\n\nInitially, we might appeal to the fact that knowledge appears to be of\nmore practical use than true belief in order to mark this difference\nin value. But, as Socrates notes, this could be questioned, because a\ntrue belief that this is the way to Larissa will get you to\nLarissa just as well as knowledge that this is the way to\nLarissa. Plato\u2019s own solution was that knowledge is formed\nin a special way distinguishing it from belief: knowledge, unlike\nbelief, must be \u2018tied down\u2019 to the truth, like the\nmythical tethered statues of Daedalus. As a result, knowledge is\nbetter suited to guide action. For example, if one knows, rather than\nmerely truly believes, that this is the way to Larissa, then one might\nbe less likely to be perturbed by the fact that the road initially\nseems to be going in the wrong direction. Mere true belief at this\npoint might be lost, since one might lose all confidence that this is\nthe right way to go.\n\nThe primary value problem has been distinguished from the\nsecondary value problem (Pritchard 2007: \u00a72). The\nsecondary value problem pertains to why knowledge is more valuable,\nfrom an epistemic point of view, than any proper subset of\nits parts. Put otherwise, why is knowledge better than any epistemic\nstanding falling short of knowing? This includes, but is not\nrestricted to, mere true belief. To illustrate the distinction,\nconsider a possible solution to the primary value problem: knowledge\nis justified true belief, and justified true belief is better than\nmere true belief, which explains why knowledge is better than true\nbelief. If correct, this hypothesis successfully answers the primary\nvalue problem. However, it requires further development to answer the\nsecondary value problem. For example, it requires further development\nto explain why knowledge is better than justified belief.\n\nOf course, on many standard theories of knowledge, knowledge is not\ndefined as justified true belief. For instance, according to some\ntheorists, knowledge is undefeated justified true belief (Lehrer &\nPaxson 1969); on other widely discussed accounts, knowledge is true\nbelief that is non-accidental (Unger 1968), sensitive (Nozick 1981),\nsafe (Sosa 1999), appropriately caused (Goldman 1967), or produced by\nintellectual virtue (Zagzebski 1996). This puts us in a position to\nappreciate what some theorists call the tertiary value\nproblem. The tertiary value problem pertains to why knowledge is\nqualitatively better than any epistemic standing falling\nshort of knowledge. Consider that if knowledge were only\nquantitatively better than that which falls just short\u2014for\ninstance, on an envisioned continuum of epistemic value\u2014then it\nwould be mysterious why epistemologists have given such attention to\nthis particular point on the continuum.\n\nWhy does knowledge have this \u201cdistinctive value\u201d not\nshared by that which falls just short of knowledge (Pritchard 2009:\n14)?\n\nNot all theorists accept that the value problems are genuine. For\nexample, in light of the literature on the Gettier problem, some\ntheorists deny that the secondary value problem is genuine. On this\napproach, whatever is added to justified true belief to rule out\nGettier cases does not increase the value of the agent\u2019s\nintellectual state: it is of no consequence whether we have\nGettier-proof justified true belief rather than mere justified true\nbelief (Kaplan 1985). Of course, Gettier cases are peculiar and\npresumably rare, so in practice having Gettier-proof justified true\nbelief is almost invariably confounded with having mere justified true\nbelief. This could lead some theorists to mistake the value of the\nlatter for that of the former. Other theorists deny that the primary\nvalue problem is genuine. For example, on one approach, knowledge just\nis true belief (Sartwell 1991). If knowledge is true belief, then\nknowledge cannot be better than true belief, because nothing can be\nbetter than itself. However, the definition of knowledge as true\nbelief has not been widely accepted.\n",
