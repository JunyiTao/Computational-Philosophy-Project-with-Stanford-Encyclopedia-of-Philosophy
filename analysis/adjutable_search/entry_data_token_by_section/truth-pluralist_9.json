    "main_text": "Objections to pluralism and responses || The instability challenge\n4.4 The instability challenge\n\n\nAnother objection to pluralism is that it is an inherently instable\nview: i.e., as soon as the view is formulated, simple reasoning renders\nit untenable (Pedersen 2006, 2010; see also Tappolet 1997, 2000; Wright\n2012). This so-called instability challenge can be presented\nas follows. According to the moderate pluralist, there is more than one\ntruth property \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\). Yet, given \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\), it seems we should recognize another truth\nproperty:\n\n(38)\n \\(\\forall p[F_U (p) \\leftrightarrow F_1 (p) \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n (p)]\\).\n\n\n\nObserve that \\(F_U\\) is not merely some property\npossessed by every \\(p\\) which happens to have one of\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\). (The property\nof being a sentence is one such a property, but it poses no trouble to\nthe pluralist.) Rather, \\(F_U\\) must be an alethic\nproperty whose extension perfectly positively covaries with the\ncombined extension of the pluralist truth properties\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\). And since\nnothing is required for the existence of this new property other than\nthe truth properties already granted by the pluralist, (38) gives a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for \\(F_U\\) to be had\nby some \\(p\\): a sentence \\(p\\) is \\(F_U\\) just in case \\(p\\) is\n\\(F_1 \\vee \\cdots \\vee F_n\\). Thus,\nany sentence that is any of \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) may be true in some more generic or universal\nway, \\(F_U\\). This suggests, at best, that strong\npluralism is false, and moderate monism is true; and at worst, there\nseems to be something instable, or self-refuting, about pluralism.\n\n\nPluralists can make concessive or non-concessive responses to the\ninstability challenge. A concessive response grants that such a truth\nproperty exists, but maintains that it poses no serious threat to\npluralism. A non-concessive response is one intended to rebut the\nchallenge, e.g., by rejecting the existence of a common or universal\ntruth property. One way of trying to motivate this rejection of\n\\(F_U\\) is by attending to the distinction between\nsparse and abundant properties, and then demonstrating that alethic\nproperties like truth must be sparse and additionally argue that the\nwould-be trouble-maker \\(F_U\\) is an abundant property.\nAccording to sparse property theorists, individuals must be unified by\nsome qualitative similarity in order to share a property. For example,\nall even numbers are qualitatively similar in that they share the\nproperty of being divisible by two without remainder. Now, consider a\nsubset of very diverse properties \\(G_1 , \\ldots ,G_n\\) possessed by an individual \\(a\\). Is there\nsome further, single property of being \\(G_1\\), or\n\u2026, or \\(G_n\\) that \\(a\\) has? Such a further\nproperty, were it to exist, would be highly disjunctive; and it may\nseem unclear what, if anything, individuals that were\n\\(G_1\\), or \u2026, or \\(G_n\\) would\nhave in common\u2014other than being \\(G_1\\), or\n\u2026, or \\(G_n\\). According to sparse property\ntheorists, the lack of qualitative similarity means that this putative\ndisjunctive property is not a property properly so-called. Abundant\nproperty theorists, on the other hand, deny that qualitative similarity\nis needed in order for a range of individuals to share a property.\nProperties can be as disjunctive as you like. Indeed, for any set\n\\(A\\) there is at least one property had by all members of\n\\(A\\)\u2014namely, being a member of \\(A\\). And since there\nis a set of all things that have some disjunctive property, there is a\nproperty\u2014abundantly construed\u2014had by exactly those things.\nIt thus seems difficult to deny the existence of \\(F_U\\)\nif the abundant conception of properties is adopted. So pluralists who\nwant to give a non-concessive response to the metaphysical instability\nchallenge may want to endorse the sparse conception (Pedersen 2006).\nThis is because the lack of uniformity in the nature of truth across\ndomains is underwritten by a lack of qualitative similarity between the\ndifferent truth properties that apply to specific domains of discourse.\nThe truth property \\(F_U\\) does not exist, because truth\nproperties are to be thought of in accordance with the sparse\nconception.\n\n\nEven if the sparse conception fails to ground pluralists\u2019\nrejection of the existence of the universal truth property\n\\(F_U\\), a concessive response to the instability\nchallenge is still available. Pluralists can make a strong case that\nthe truth properties \\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\) are more fundamental than the universal truth\nproperty \\(F_U\\) (Pedersen 2010). This is because\n\\(F_U\\) is metaphysically dependent on\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\), in the sense\nthat \\(F_U\\) is introduced in virtue of its being one of\n\\(F_1 , \\ldots ,F_n\\), and not\nvice-versa. Hence, even if the pluralist commits to the existence of\n\\(F_U\\)\u2014and hence, to moderate metaphysical\nmonism\u2014there is still a clear sense in which her view is\ndistinctively more pluralist than monist.\n",
