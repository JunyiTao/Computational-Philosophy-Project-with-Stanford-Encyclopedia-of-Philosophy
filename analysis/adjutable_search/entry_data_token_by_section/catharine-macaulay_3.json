    "main_text": "Republican Liberty and The History of England || Macaulay\u2019s History and her response to Hobbes\n2.2 Macaulay\u2019s History and her response to Hobbes\n\nMacaulay has been called a \u201cpatriot historian\u201d and her\nhistory is certainly intended to praise the English\n\u201cpatriots\u201d who stood up for their fundamental rights\nagainst the absolutist tendencies of James I and Charles I (Pocock\n1998). Her account of the years leading up to the Civil War\nconstitutes a litany of acts of illegal taxation, abuses of power,\narbitrary arrest and inhumane punishments. She praises in particular\nSir John Elliot, \u201cas the first martyr to the pre-eminent cause\nof liberty,\u201d mentioning in particular a manuscript by him in\nwhich he argues that kings are subject to laws (Macaulay\n1763\u201383, 2.81). But she is not simply a blind defender of the\nancient constitution, or committed to English liberty for its own\nsake. She believes in the possibility of moral progress, and, as is\nalready clear from her letter to Paoli, she sees the maintenance of a\njust political constitution, and the development of individual virtue,\nas inseparably intertwined. Thus she asserts in her response to\nBurke\u2019s Reflections on the Revolution in France that English\nliberties are not simply grounded in customs associated with the\nEnglish monarchy.\n\n\nI have myself always considered the boasted birthright of an\nEnglishman, as an arrogant pretension, built on a\nbeggarly foundation. It is an arrogant pretension, because it\nintimates a kind of exclusion to the rest of mankind from the same\nprivileges; and it is beggarly, because it rests our legitimate\nfreedom on the alms of our princes. (Macaulay 1790,\n31\u20132)\n\n\nIn her Loose remarks on certain positions to be found in Mr.\nHobbes\u2019s Philosophical Rudiments of Government and Society she\nrebuts Hobbes\u2019s purely political conception of the state, countering\nit with her own more moralised conception of the nature of political\nauthority, which also informs her account of the Civil War\n(Gunther-Canada 2006).\n\nShe begins with Hobbes\u2019s claim that humans are not sociable by nature,\nwhich she renders as his denial of the proposition that \u201cman is\na creature born fit for society.\u201d According to Hobbes, as she\nrepresents his doctrine,\n\n\n\u2026 man cannot desire society from love, but through hope of\ngain: therefore, says he, the original of all great and lasting\nsocieties consisted, not in the mutual good will men had toward each\nother, but of the mutual fear they had of each other. (Macaulay 1767,\n1)\n\n\nBut she accuses Hobbes of contradicting himself, because, according to\nwhat he also accepts, man is a creature fit for society.\nHobbes allows that there is a law of nature, which is the law of right\nreason. This is the same law of nature that Locke recognises, and is\nfundamentally the Golden Rule, \u201cdo unto others as you would have\nthem do unto you.\u201d Humans need only to acquire reason in order\nto be able to recognise this rule. And while they may not be born with\nthe capacity to reason, just as they are not born with the capacity to\nwalk, they are born with the means to acquire that capacity. Macaulay\nconcludes:\n\n\nTherefore man, by being born with the necessary means, is born a\ncreature apt for reason; and a creature apt for reason is a creature\nfit for society. (Macaulay 1767, 3)\n\n\nSince moral principles are immutable truths grounded in the nature of\nthings, and discoverable by reason, humans as rational creatures are\nborn capable of discovering these truths, and while their natural\nrationality may need to be developed by education, this potential for\nrationality is all that is needed for humans to be deemed naturally\nsociable.\n\nMacaulay moves on to criticize Hobbes\u2019s strange doctrine in relation\nto contracts, according to which the people contract with each other\nto be governed by the sword of an absolute monarch. Implicitly relying\non the moral conception of a just contract, Macaulay argues that a\ncontract requires at least two parties. If one of those parties were\nto dissolve after the contract, as Hobbes suggests the sovereign\npeople do, then the contract would be null and void (Macaulay 1767,\n6\u20137). While this response may not satisfy defenders of Hobbes,\nit allows us to understand Macaulay\u2019s conception of the social\ncontract as an implicit or explicit contract between the people and\nsome individual or assembly, according to which the people transfer a\nlimited power for the sake of the common good, and retain the right to\ndeclare the contract null, in case the other party fails to keep up\ntheir end of the bargain. It is in this light that she represents the\nexecution of Charles I.\n\n\nThat the government is the ordinance of man; that, being the mere\ncreature of human invention, it may be changed or altered according to\nthe dictates of experience, and the better judgment of men; that it\nwas instituted for the protection of the people, for the end of\nsecuring, not overthrowing the rights of nature; that it is a trust\neither formally admitted or supposed; and that the magistracy is\nconsequently accountable; will meet with little contradiction in a\ncountry enlightened with the unobstructed ray of rational learning.\n(Macaulay 1763\u201383, 430\u20131)\n\n\nHer text at this point is liberally sprinkled with references to\nLocke, one of her major sources for the doctrine of republican\nliberty, which underpins the people\u2019s right to overthrow a monarch who\nhas made himself a tyrant, and in effect reinstituted a state of\nnature.\n\nShe objects also to Hobbes\u2019s claim that there are no natural moral\nrights and obligations which connect parents and children. Parents\nhave an obligation to care for their children which derives from the\nnature of the relationship between them,\n\n\n\u2026reason and morality strongly urges the care and preservation\nof an existence by themselves occasioned as a duty never to be\nomitted; by the law of justice, therefore, they, being thus bound to\nthis act, cannot have it in their option whether they will do it or\nnot: but Mr. Hobbes will rather advance any absurdity, than own that\npower has its rights from reasonable causes. (Macaulay 1767, 10)\n\n\nChildren\u2019s obligations to parents, by contrast, are grounded in\ngratitude, which is appropriate in relation to the benefits conferred,\nand so are not binding if parents have not fulfilled their duties to\ntheir children.\n\nThe bulk of the rest of Macaulay\u2019s response to Hobbes consists in\narguments against his defence of monarchy. In general these do not add\nmuch to the principles that she has already laid down, but they do add\nsome practical reasons for thinking that monarchical governments will\nnearly always be defective, which are echoed in Macaulay\u2019s histories.\nShe points out that it is almost impossible to give advice to absolute\nmonarchs, and they are likely to be surrounded by favourites, placemen\nand flatterers. In her histories she provides many examples of the\ninconveniences that accompany monarchical power. Commenting on the\ndeath of Buckingham she points to him as\n\n\n\u2026 an everlasting monument of the contemptible government that\nmagnanimous nations must submit to, who groan under the mean, though\noppressive yoke of an arbitrary sway.\n\n\nFor, as a result of the power of individual monarchs, he\n\n\n\u2026 with no other eminent qualities than what were proper to\ncaptivate the hearts of the weakest parts of the female sex, had been\nraised by these qualities to be the scourge of three kingdoms; and, by\nhis pestilent intrigues, the chief cause of that distress which the\nFrench protestants at this time languished under. (Macaulay\n1763\u201383, 2.7\u20138)\n\n\nElsewhere she sums up the reign of Queen Anne with the comment that\nshe\n\n\n\u2026 was a glaring example to shew the ticklish state in which\nsociety is involved, whose welfare depends on the conduct of an\nindividual; since a high share of virtue and understanding, those\nchoicest gifts of heaven, are dispensed by the Creator with so sparing\na hand, that we find a very few individuals in any age whom we can in\nthis respect mark as the favourites of heaven. (Macaulay 1778,\n271)\n\n",
