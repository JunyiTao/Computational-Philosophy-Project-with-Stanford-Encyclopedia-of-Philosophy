Culmination of the Classical Period\n\nThe Buddhist thinker, Dign\u0101ga (c. 5th \u2013 6th century ce),\nconsolidates the insights into the canonical\ndeductively valid syllogism of his predecessors, and in particular\nthose of his teacher, Vasubandhu, as well as deepens them. He is, in\nfact, a pivotal figure in the history of Indian logic. This section is\ndivided into two parts: the first devoted to Dign\u0101ga\u2019s\ncontributions to Indian logic, especially the canonical syllogism, the\nsecond part summarizing other contributions from his contemporaries\nand successors, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist.\n",
