    "main_text": "Evil-Skepticism Versus Evil-Revivalism || Evil and the Supernatural\n1.1 Evil and the Supernatural\n\nThe concept of evil is often associated with supernatural powers or\ncreatures, especially in fictional and religious contexts. The\nmonsters of fictions, such as vampires, witches, and werewolves, are\nthought to be paradigms of evil. These creatures possess powers and\nabilities that defy scientific explanation, and perhaps human\nunderstanding. Many popular horror films also depict evil as the\nresult of dark forces or Satanic possession. We find similar\nreferences to supernatural forces and creatures when the term\n\u2018evil\u2019 is used in religious contexts. Some evil-skeptics\nbelieve that the concept of evil necessarily makes reference to\nsupernatural spirits, dark forces, or creatures. According to these\ntheorists if we do not believe that these spirits, forces, or monsters\nexist, we should only use the term \u2018evil\u2019 in fictional\ncontexts, if at all (See Clendinnen 1999, 79\u2013113; Cole 2006,\n2019).\n\nEvil-revivalists respond that the concept of evil need not make\nreference to supernatural spirits, dark forces, or monsters. There is\na secular moral concept of evil which is distinct from fictional or\nreligious conceptions, and it is this secular conception of evil that\nis meant most often when the term \u2018evil\u2019 is used in moral\nand political contexts (see Garrard 2002, 325; Card 2010,\n10\u201317). Evil-revivalists seek to offer plausible analyses of\nevil which do not make reference to supernatural spirits, dark forces,\nor monsters, but which fully capture secular uses of the term\n\u2018evil.\u2019 Evil-revivalists believe that if they are able to\noffer plausible analyses of evil which do not make reference to the\nsupernatural, they will have successfully defended the concept of evil\nfrom the objection that ascriptions of evil necessarily imply\nunwarranted metaphysical commitments (see sections 3 and 4 for secular\naccounts of evil).\n",
