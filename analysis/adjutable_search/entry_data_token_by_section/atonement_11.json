    "main_text": "How to Atone || Third Party Assistance\n2.8 Third Party Assistance\n\nThe wrongdoer will have to do at least some of the atoning work.\nAtonement aims at moral reconciliation at the very least, which\nrequires a renewed respect for the victim from the wrongdoer. This\nrenewed respect requires at least repentance and perhaps make some\nefforts at moral transformation. However, it seems that people other\nthan the wrongdoer can assist with atonement. Indeed, according to\nChristianity, Christ has made atonement for all human sin even though\nChrist himself is completely innocent of sin.\n\nThere is a difference between helping another person to atone, and\natoning for another person. The former is plainly possible. A\nwrongdoer\u2019s friend could help them to atone by, for example,\nencouraging them to repent, helping them construct a true account of\nthe wrong action, discussing with them ways to apologize, driving them\nto a meeting with the victim so that the wrongdoer can apologize. The\nlatter also seems possible. Indeed, an entire religious\ntradition\u2014Christianity\u2014is predicated on its possibility.\nAquinas, following similar statements by Anselm, writes,\n\n\nsince those who differ as to the debt of punishment may be one in will\nby the union of love, it happens that one who has not sinned bears\nwillingly the punishment for another, just as even in human affairs we\nsee men take the debts of another upon themselves. (ST\nI-II.87.7)\n\n\nThe sort of punishment that others can bear for us is what he calls\n\u201csatisfactory punishment\u201d, which amounts to what we above\ncalled reparation imposed as punishment. Thus, a wrongdoer\u2019s\nfriend could pay a fine, or replace a damaged or lost item, or perform\nsome other act of service that is owed to the victim.\n\nCan third parties atone for a wrongdoer by acting as a substitute for\npunishment in the narrower sense described in\n section 2.7?\n D. Lewis (1997) argues that we are of two minds about penal\nsubstitution. He observes, following a long line of thinkers\nstretching back at least to Socinus in the sixteenth century CE, that\nwe do not allow penal substitution amongst humans for punishments such\nas imprisonment, the death penalty, and lashings. If someone were to\noffer themselves in place of their brother, say, on the electric\nchair, \u201cthe offer would strike the authorities as senseless, and\nthey would decline it out of hand\u201d (D. Lewis 1997: 129).\nHowever, Lewis also observes that we are of two minds because we also\nseem to have no problem with third parties paying penal fines on\nbehalf of wrongdoers.\n\nM. Murphy (2009) and Quinn (2004) observe that we are sometimes\nuncomfortable with penal fines being paid by a third party. Murphy\nargues, further\u2014assuming an expressivist view of\npunishment\u2014that penal substitution is incoherent because the\nputative punishment undergone by the third party does not express any\ncondemnation of the third party. However, he thinks that vicarious\npunishment is possible and can be justly performed. Vicarious\npunishment occurs when\n\n\nA deserves to be punished; B undergoes hard treatment, which hard\ntreatment constitutes A\u2019s being punished; and so A no longer\ndeserves to be punished. (M. Murphy 2009: 260)\n\n\nHill and Jedwab (2015) object that Murphy begs the question by\nassuming that the recipient of punishment must be the object of\ncondemnation. They suggest there are cases where this seems false,\nsuch as when a teacher punishes everyone in a class for the actions of\na few students, or when a sergeant imposes suffering on all the\nsoldiers in a squad because of the actions of just a few members.\nThurow (2015) agrees that these can be cases of penal substitution,\nbut he explains how penal substitution is conceptually and morally\npossible by understanding the third party as acting for a collective\nentity of which they are a member, where the collective is guilty of\nwrongdoing.\n\nCraig (2020) rejects Murphy\u2019s argument on the grounds that there\nare cases of punishment that do not express condemnation, e.g.,\npunishment for crimes of strict liability such as marijuana\npossession. (See\n section 4.3\n for further discussion of penal substitution.)\n",
