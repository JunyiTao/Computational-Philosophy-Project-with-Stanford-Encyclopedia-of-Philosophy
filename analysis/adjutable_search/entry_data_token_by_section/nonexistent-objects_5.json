    "main_text": "Further Motivations for Belief in Nonexistent Objects || The Problem of Discourse about the Past and the Future\n3.3 The Problem of Discourse about the Past and the Future\n\nThe structure of the problem of discourse about the past and the\nfuture is very similar to the structure of the problem of fictional\ndiscourse. Consider the following sentences:\n\n(1)\nSocrates was a philosopher.\n(2)\nThe first female pope will be black.\n\n\nGiven that the sentences (1) and (2) have the logical structure of\npredications, i.e., the structure \u201c\\(Fb\\)\u201d, and given\nthat (PP) is valid, (1) implies that Socrates exists and (2) implies\nthat the first female pope exists.\n\nIndeed, the sentences (1) and (2) look like predications.\nGrammatically speaking, they consist of a subject term\n(\u201cSocrates\u201d, \u201cthe first female pope\u201d) and a\npredicate term (\u201cwas a philosopher\u201d, \u201cwill be\nblack\u201d.) But while it is certainly true now (in the\nthird millennium C.E.) that Socrates was a philosopher, it is also\ncertainly true now that Socrates does not exist anymore.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that indeed\nthere will be a female pope (and exactly one first female pope) at\nsome time in the far future and that she will be black and that she\nhas not even been fathered yet. Given these assumptions, it is\ncertainly true now that the first female pope does not yet exist.\n\nAgain, there are several attempts to resolve this problem. One\npossible strategy is to deny that sentences like (1) and (2) really\nhave the logical structure of predications. One might suggest the\nfollowing alternative interpretations, using \u201c\\(P\\)\u201d\n(read: \u201cIt has been the case\u201d) and\n\u201c\\(F\\)\u201d (read: \u201cIt will be the case\u201d) as\n\u201ctense operators\u201d:\n\n(1\u2032)\n\\(P\\)(Socrates is a philosopher).\n(2\u2032)\n\\(F\\)(The first female pope is black).\n\n\nNote that the tense operators \u201c\\(P\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(F\\)\u201d are sentence operators, like the story\noperator from above. Just as the story operator blocks the inference\nto existence claims about fictitious objects, the tense operators\nblock the inference from (1\u2032) to\n\n(3)\nSocrates exists.\n\n\nand from (2\u2032) to\n\n(4)\nThe first female pope exists. (For a tense operator strategy see\nPrior 1968.)\n\n\nThere is a lot to be said in favor of this logical interpretation of\ntenses. Yet, it leaves some problems unresolved. One of them is the\nproblem of tensed plural quantifiers. Consider, for\ninstance:\n\n(5)\nThere have been two kings named Charles.\n\n\nThe standard tense operator interpretation of (5) yields:\n\n(5\u2032)\n\\(P\\)(There are two kings named Charles).\n\n\nHowever, while (5) is true, (5\u2032) is false, since at no time in\nthe past there have been two kings named Charles\nsimultaneously. (See Lewis 2004.) Thus, the standard tense\noperator strategy seems to fail in cases like this one.\n\nAnother problem that the tense operator strategy leaves unresolved is\nthe problem of relations between present and non-present\nobjects. Given the principle that a real (two-place) relation can\nobtain only if both terms of the relation exist, and given that past\nand future objects do not (now) exist, relations between present and\npast or future objects are impossible. Yet it seems that there are\nplenty of relations between present and past (or future) objects. For\ninstance, I stand in the relation of being one of six\ngranddaughters of to my grandmother. Likewise, perhaps I stand in\nthe relation of being the grandmother of to a future\nchild.\n\nHere is a Meinongian solution: Suppose objects pop in and out of\nexistence but thereby do not gain or lose their\nbeing. (For a Meinongian, all existent objects have being but\nnot all being objects exist.) According to this picture,\n\u201cSocrates\u201d now denotes the nonexistent Socrates and\n\u201cthe first female pope\u201d now denotes the nonexistent first\nfemale pope. Accordingly, although we cannot allow for the inference\nfrom\n\n(1)\nSocrates was a philosopher.\n\n\nand\n\n(2)\nThe first female pope will be black.\n\n\nto\n\n(3)\nSocrates exists.\n\n\nand\n\n(4)\nThe first female pope exists.\n\n\nwe can allow for the inference from (1) and (2) to\n\n(3\u2032)\nThere is something that is identical with Socrates.\n\n\nand\n\n(4\u2032)\nThere is something that is identical with the first female\n pope.[17]\n\n\nThis result does justice to two otherwise incompatible intuitions,\nnamely (i) the intuition that neither Socrates nor the first female\npope exist right now, and (ii) the intuition that it is nevertheless\npossible to refer to Socrates and to the first female pope (or, to put\nit another way: the intuition that the name \u201cSocrates\u201d and\nthe description \u201cthe first female pope\u201d are not\nempty).\n\nTensed plural quantifiers do not pose a problem for a Meinongian.\nTensed quantifiers in general may be interpreted as\nrestricted quantifiers that range over a particular subdomain\nof nonexistent objects: \u201cthere was\u201d may be interpreted as\na quantifier that ranges over the subdomain of past objects (i.e.,\nobjects that have existed but do not exist anymore); analogously,\n\u201cthere will be\u201d may be interpreted as a quantifier that\nranges over the subdomain of future objects (i.e., objects that will\nexist but do not exist\n yet).[18]\n\nFurthermore, from a Meinongian point of view, relations between\nexistent and nonexistent objects are ubiquitous. Remember the\nMeinongian solution to the problem of intentionality: people fear,\nadmire, dream of, hope for, or imagine nonexistent objects. Thus,\nrelations between present and non-present objects do not pose a\nparticular problem for a Meinongian.\n",
