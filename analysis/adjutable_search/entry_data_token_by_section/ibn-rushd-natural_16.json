    "main_text": "First Movable, First Mover, Eternal Motion\n17. First Movable, First Mover, Eternal Motion\n\n1) Aristotle begins his Book VIII of the Physics raising the\nquestion whether motion has come into being and will cease to be, or\nis eternal \u201cbelonging to all beings as their immortal and never\nfailing property\u201d (250b13\u201314). In order to answer it, he\ndevelops various arguments the main one being based on the definition\nof motion as the actualization of the movable in so far as movable\n(251a10). If there was a first motion, and since any movable requires\na mover, there must have pre-existed a mover and a movable, something\ncapable of setting fire and something capable of burning, for\ninstance. If these have come into being, there must have been a change\nbefore the supposed first change that brought them into existence. If\nthey pre-existed without change occurring, a previous change must have\noccurred that set them into the condition of moving and being moved.\nBy reductio ad absurdum, it is proved that motion has always\nexisted.\n\nAristotle ends up by identifying eternal motion with a specific motion\nthat of the heavenly sphere, but in doing this he jumps from a\nphilosophical to a scientific explanation, and the leap is scarcely\njustifiable. He can only assume that a single eternal motion exists\n(Ross 1936: 91). Glasner describes it as Aristotle\u2019s failure to\novercome the so called succession argument (Glasner 2009: 76).\n\nThe Greek commentators concentrated on whether potentiality has to\nprecede motion or is simultaneous with it, and Philoponus adduced\nheavy arguments against potentiality preceding motion (Puig Montada\n1999). Averroes followed the tradition of those commentators for a\nlong time, he knew well the contributions by al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nand Avempace to the discussion and he sided with them. The beginning\nof the Long Commentary hints at it:\n\n\nSince [Aristotle\u2019s] purpose is to inquire about the first mover,\nhe begins by inquiring about motion, whether it is eternal or\ninnovated, that is, according to the genus, and that which precedes\nthis treatise, either is necessary to this section, or is for the sake\nof better. And when he said \u201cWhether motion\u201d, he did not\nmean any specific (proprium) motion, but he wanted to know\nwhether those motions existent in the parts of the universe came to\nbe, after no part of the universe moved at all, etc. (LC 338FG TC1;\nSchmieja8, 2: 2\u20137 MC Glasner 94\u201395)\n\n\nIn the same chapter, however, Averroes gives up this interpretation\nthat he considered to be what he calls \u201cat first glance\u201d\n(in primo aspectu, LC 339A). After long investigation he\ngained the deeper and true meaning of Aristotle\u2019s words: The\ninquiry about motion concerns that motion embracing the universe, or\nmaybe several motions (if it is proven that the heavenly spheres have\nseveral movers), that is, it concerns one species of motion, and wants\nto know if it is eternal or innovated (LC 339C).\n\nOf course, Averroes was wrong with his new interpretation of Aristotle\nbut the new interpretation helped him to design his vision of the\nuniverse, and to counter the attacks of the Ash\u02bbarite theologians\nagainst the eternity of creation. If a particular motion precedes\nanother one, the resulting succession, or\n continuity,[19]\n is purely accidental for Averroes and it is no basis for the\nargumentation conducted by al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Avempace, etc. On\nthe contrary the eternal motion of the heavenly spheres possesses\ncontinuity per se, while the rest of motions possess\naccidentally.\n\nAn objection could be raised against the new interpretation, and\nindeed it had been raised by al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (d. 1111 CE) in his\npolemical writing The Incoherence of the Philosophers\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b [2002]). Potentiality has to precede motion, as\npotentiality precedes the act; Averroes agrees with the tenet but\nrestricts it to the sublunary world, to innovated motions. The rule of\ntemporal priority does not apply to \u201cmotion as motion, but to\nsomething innovated as innovated\u201d (novo facto, LC\n341IK).\n\n2) Aristotle argues for eternity also from the angle of time,\nendorsing the common belief that \u201cthere is always time\u201d\nand in Physics VIII.1 he concludes that it has been\ndemonstrated that there never was nor will be a time when motion was\nnot or will not be (252b5\u20136). Aristotle rejects the views of\nAnaxagoras and Empedocles (252a5\u2013b5). For Anaxagoras there is a\nsingle principle of motion, Mind; for Empedocles Love and Strife\nalternately prevail and cause motion. Averroes points out two\ninconsistencies of their views. First, the laws of Nature do not\nadmit, \u201csomething to be possible for an endless time in the\npast, and then to be brought into existence\u201d (LC 349H TC15) and\nsecond, its laws rebut that the mover and the movable are at rest for\nan endless time and that then, at a given moment, motion starts.\n\nAverroes compares Anaxagoras and Empedocles with the Ash\u02bbarite\ntheologians, who introduce the Divine will instead of Nature as the\nmoving agent, \u201cthey establish a voluntary mover\u201d (LC\n349I). The discussion goes at length (LC 349I\u2013350L) and\nparallels that of the First Question in the Incoherence of the\nIncoherence. Averroes denies that an eternal will can originate a\ntemporally initiated action (actio nova). If the will is\neternal, the willed object has to be eternal, and vice\nversa.\n\n\nThe will does not postpone what it intends except because some cause\n(intentio) exists in the willed thing that did not exist at\nthe time of [the action of] willing and if [that cause] was not there,\nthat which is willed must be together with the will. If we would\nassume that there is a will in which the delay of the willed is\npossible, this would occur because something exists that did not exist\nbefore, i.e., because some cause, or disposition, was absent. There\nwould be neither time nor anything because we affirmed that this will\nis the first motion, and it is obvious that this willed object must be\ntogether with the will. Therefore if we would affirm that the will is\neternal, the willed would be eternal. (LC 349LM; Schmieja8, 43: 21\u201344: 6)\n\n\nThe world of coming-to-be and passing-away shows however that there is\nrest and that motions start and end. We see innovated events. Averroes\nmakes an exception to explain the apparent contradiction: The will can\nprecede the willed object through an infinite time although in an\naccidental way and this is \u201cclear to those who know the\ndifference between essentially and accidentally\u201d (LC 350C). An\nintermediate motion is the key solution and the motion he considered\nwas that which Aristotle searched for in Book VIII, i.e., the specific\nmotion of the heavenly spheres.\n\nThe theologians argued that an endless chain of motions was impossible\nand that a first motion had to be created anew (ex novo).\nAristotle argued that motion is generically eternal since no beginning\ncan be determined. The former had a linear image of eternity and the\nlatter, a circular one. Averroes stepped in with an original proposal:\nthe succession of motions is accidental, not per se. But any\naccident presupposes a propriety to which is related. The heavenly\nmotion is eternal per se and it is the reference to the\naccidental eternity. Averroes answers the Ash\u02bbarites:\n\n\nWe say that it [succession of motions] is essentially impossible, not\naccidentally, that is, if there was an agent whose being has no\nbeginning, it resulted that his actions have no beginning. (LC 350D;\nSchmieja8, 40: 14\u201317; MC Glasner 82; MC Wolfson 495)\n\n\nand this kind of eternity is essential.\n",
