    "main_text": "Variations on the Standard Dialogical Framework\n3. Variations on the Standard Dialogical Framework\n\nThe previous section presented the standard dialogical framework in\nthe Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition. Different logics can be expressed\nwithin this framework, they can thus also be compared (e.g., classical\nand intuitionistic logic, and modal logics). Different objections have\nbeen raised against the standard framework, as the three objections\npresented below attest; various answers have been given by logicians\ninterested in the dialogical perspective, often abandoning the\nLorenzen and Lorenz tradition 1 in order to build a framework most\nappropriate to their own purposes (for other objections and their answer, see R\u00fcckert 2001).\n\nIn this section two variations of the standard framework are briefly\nconsidered, with their answers to objections made to the standard\nframework: the Immanent Reasoning framework maintains itself in the\ninitial tradition, whereas the Built-In Opponent (BIO) framework\ndistances itself from the standard approach.\n",
