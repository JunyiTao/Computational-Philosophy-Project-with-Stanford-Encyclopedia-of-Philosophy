    "main_text": "Ethics and Political Philosophy\n6. Ethics and Political Philosophy\n\nArchytas\u2019 search for the numbers in things was not limited to\nthe natural world. Political relationships and the moral action of\nindividuals were also explained in terms of number and proportion. In\nFr. 3, rational calculation is identified as the basis of the stable\nstate:\n\nOnce calculation (logismos) was discovered, it stopped\ndiscord and increased concord. For people do not want more than their\nshare, and equality exists, once this has come into being. For by\nmeans of calculation we will seek reconciliation in our dealings with\nothers. Through this, then, the poor receive from the powerful, and\nthe wealthy give to the needy, both in the confidence that they will\nhave what is fair on account of this.\n\nThis glorification of calculation is reminiscent of Plato\u2019s\npraise for \u201cgeometrical equality\u201d in the Gorgias\n(507e6\u2013508a8) and Plato may be thinking of Archytas Fr. 3\n(Palmer 2014: 205\u20136; Huffman 2013: 259\u201361). The emphasis\non equality (isotas) and fairness (to ison) suggests\nthat Archytas envisages rational calculation (logismos) as\nheavily mathematical. On the other hand, logismos is not\nidentical to the technical science of number (logistic \u2013 see 3.2\nabove) but is rather a practical ability to understand numerical\ncalculations, including basic proportions, an ability that is shared\nby most human beings. It is the clarity of calculation and proportion\nthat does away with the constant striving for more\n(pleonexia), which produces discord in the state. Since the\nstate is based on a widely shared human ability to calculate, an\nability that the rich and poor share, Archytas was led to support a\nmore democratic constitution (see 1.3 above) than Plato, who\nemphasizes the expert mathematical knowledge of a few (R.\n546a ff.). Zhmud (2006: 60\u201376) points out connections between B3\nand Isocrates and argues that Isocrates is referring to Archytas, when\nhe says that some praise the sciences for their utility and others try\nto demonstrate that they contribute greatly to virtue\n(Busiris 23). However, Archytas seems to accept both of these\nviews about the sciences, while Isocrates refers to two different\ngroups of people. Isocrates\u2019 reference is also very general and\nmakes no allusion to the central terms of B3 so that it is doubtful\nthat he has Archytas in mind. For further discussion of the argument\nof B3 see Huffman 2005: 182\u2013224 and Schofield 2008. \n\nMost of our evidence for Archytas\u2019 ethical views is,\nunfortunately, not based on fragments of his writings but rather on\nanecdotes, which probably ultimately derive from Aristoxenus\u2019\nLife of Archytas. The good life of the individual, no less\nthan the stability of the state, appears to have been founded on\nrational calculation. Aristoxenus presented a confrontation between\nthe Syracusan hedonist, Polyarchus, and Archytas. Polyarchus\u2019\nlong speech is preserved by Athenaeus and Archytas\u2019 response by\nCicero (A9 = Deip. 545a and Sen. XII 39\u201341\nrespectively). Schofield (2014: 70, n.2) raises doubts about whether\nCicero really preserves Archytas\u2019 response (See Huffman 2005:\n323\u201337). Horky (2011: 120) assumes without argument that\nAristoxenus presented Archytas as delivering his speech in the\npresence of Plato and the Samnite C. Pontius, but this is part of\nCicero\u2019s frame story and there is no evidence that it derives\nfrom Aristoxenus. Polyarchus\u2019 defense of always striving for\nmore (pleonexia) and of the pursuit of pleasure is\nreminiscent of Plato\u2019s presentations of Callicles and\nThrasymachus, but is not derived from those presentations and is\nbetter seen as an important parallel development (Huffman 2002b).\nArchytas bases his response on the premise that reason (= rational\ncalculation) is the best part of us and the part that should govern\nour actions. Polyarchus might grant such a premise, since his is a\nrational hedonism. Archytas responds once again with a thought\nexperiment. We are to imagine someone in the throes of the greatest\npossible bodily pleasure (sexual orgasm?). Surely we must agree that a\nperson in such a state is not able to engage in rational calculation.\nIt thus appears that bodily pleasure is in itself antithetical to\nreason and that, the more we succeed in obtaining it, the less we are\nable to reason. Aristotle appears to refer to this argument in the\nNicomachean Ethics (1152b16\u201318). Archytas\u2019\nargument is specifically directed against bodily pleasure and he did\nnot think that all pleasure was disruptive; he enjoyed playing with\nchildren (A8) and recognized that the pleasures of friendship were\npart of a good life (Cicero, Amic. XXIII 88). Other anecdotes\nemphasize that our actions must be governed by reason rather than the\nemotions: Archytas refused to punish the serious misdeeds of his\nslaves, because he had become angry and did not want to act out of\nanger (A7); he restrained himself from swearing aloud by writing his\ncurses on a wall instead (A11). Palmer argues that Archytas was\nworking with a Pythagorean conception of the soul as divided into two\nparts: the intellect and a part responsible for the affective states\nsuch as emotions and appetites (2014: 209). \n",
