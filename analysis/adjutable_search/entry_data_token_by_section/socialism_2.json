Socialist Critiques of Capitalism and their Grounds (Dimension DI)\n\nSocialists have condemned capitalism by alleging that it typically\nfeatures exploitation, domination, alienation, and inefficiency.\nBefore surveying these criticisms, it is important to note that they\nrely on various ideals and principles at DI. We first mention these\ngrounds briefly, and then elaborate on them as we discuss their\nengagement in socialists\u2019 critical arguments. We set aside the\ndebate, conducted mostly during the 1980s and largely centered on the\ninterpretation of Marx\u2019s writings, as to whether the\ncondemnation of capitalism and the advocacy for socialism relies (or\nshould rely), on moral grounds (Geras 1985; Lukes 1985; Peffer 1990).\nWhereas some Marxist socialists take the view that criticism of\ncapitalism can be conducted without making use\u2014either explicitly\nor implicitly\u2014of arguments with a moral foundation, our focus is\non arguments that do rely on such grounds.\n",
