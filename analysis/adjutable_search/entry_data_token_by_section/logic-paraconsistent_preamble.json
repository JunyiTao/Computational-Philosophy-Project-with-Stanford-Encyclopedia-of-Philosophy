    "main_text": "\n\nA standard contemporary logical view has it that, from contradictory\npremises, anything follows. A logical consequence relation is\nexplosive if according to it any arbitrary conclusion \\(B\\)\nis entailed by any arbitrary contradiction \\(A\\), \\(\\neg A\\) (ex\ncontradictione quodlibet (ECQ)). Classical logic, and most\nstandard \u2018non-classical\u2019 logics too such as intuitionist\nlogic, are explosive. Inconsistency, according to received wisdom,\ncannot be coherently reasoned about.\n\nParaconsistent logic challenges this standard view. A logical consequence\nrelation is said to be paraconsistent if it is not explosive.\nThus, if a consequence relation is paraconsistent, then even in\ncircumstances where the available information is inconsistent, the\nconsequence relation does not explode into triviality. Thus,\nparaconsistent logic accommodates inconsistency in a controlled way\nthat treats inconsistent information as potentially informative.\n\nThe prefix \u2018para\u2019 in English has two meanings:\n\u2018quasi\u2019 (or \u2018similar to, modelled on\u2019) or\n\u2018beyond\u2019. When the term \u2018paraconsistent\u2019 was\ncoined by Mir\u00f3 Quesada at the Third Latin America Conference on\nMathematical Logic in 1976, he seems to have had the first meaning in\nmind. Many paraconsistent logicians, however, have taken it to mean\nthe second, which provided different reasons for the development of\nparaconsistent logic as we will see below.\n\nParaconsistent logic is defined negatively: any logic is\nparaconsistent as long as it is not explosive. This means there is no\nsingle set of open problems or programs in paraconsistent logic. As\nsuch, this entry is not a complete survey of paraconsistent logic. The\naim is to describe some philosophically salient features of a diverse\nfield.\n",
