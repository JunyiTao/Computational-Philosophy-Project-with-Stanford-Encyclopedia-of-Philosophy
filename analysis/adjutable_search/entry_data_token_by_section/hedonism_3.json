    "main_text": "Ethical Hedonism\n2. Ethical Hedonism\n\n\nAt its simplest, ethical hedonism is the claim that all and only\npleasure has positive importance and all and only pain or displeasure\nhas negative importance. This importance is to be understood\nnon-instrumentally, that is, independently of the importance of\nanything that pleasure or displeasure might cause or prevent. From\nethical hedonism, it follows that if our relationships, achievements,\nknowledge, character states, and so on, have any non-instrumental\nimportance, this is just a matter of any pleasure or displeasure that\nis in their natures. Otherwise, they have only instrumental importance\nthrough the pleasure they cause or displeasure they diminish. At least\nfrom the simple forms of ethical hedonism, it also follows that\npleasure is good whenever it is had, even in matters that are\nthemselves worthless or worse. Some hedonists are willing to bite such\nbullets; others develop more complex forms of ethical hedonism that\nseek to soften the bullets or even to dissolve them.\n\n\nSome things have both instrumental and non-instrumental importance,\nand in such cases their overall importance is a function of both. These\ntwo matters can also pull in opposite directions. Your pain of being\nonce bitten has non-instrumental negative importance, for example, but\nit might also have instrumental positive importance through the further\npain you avoid by its making you twice shy. Instrumental importance is\na contingent matter and it varies widely from case to case. This is why\nthe non-instrumental claims of pleasure and displeasure are the present\nfocus.\n\n\nEthical hedonism can be universalist, me-and-my-near-and-dear\negocentric, or egoistically focused just on one's own pleasure.\nIt can also be a claim about value, morality, well-being, rationality,\nreasons or aesthetics. It can be a claim about grounds for action,\nbelief, motivation or feeling; or a claim about ought, obligation, good\nand bad, or right and wrong. And these are not the only\npossibilities. The discussion below aims for both determinacy of\nformulation and generality across the different forms of ethical\nhedonism, albeit that these two aims are in some tension with one\nanother. For economy of expression, discussion proceeds below in terms\nof hedonism about value. At its simplest, this is the thesis that\nanything has non-instrumental value if and only if it is an instance of\npleasure, and has non-instrumental disvalue if and only if it is an\ninstance of pain or displeasure.\n",
