    "main_text": "Philosophical Problems of Evolutionary Game Theory || The explanatory irrelevance of evolutionary game theory\n6.3 The value-ladenness of evolutionary game theoretic explanations\n\nIf one seeks to use an evolutionary game theoretic model to explain\nthe normativity attached to a social rule, one must explain how such\nan approach avoids committing the so-called \u201cnaturalistic\nfallacy\u201d of inferring an ought-statement from a conjunction of\n is-statements.[16]\n Assuming that the explanation does not commit such a fallacy, one\nargument charges that it must then be the case that the evolutionary\ngame theoretic explanation merely repackages certain key value claims\ntacitly assumed in the construction of the model. After all, since any\nargument whose conclusion is a normative statement must have at least\none normative statement in the premises, any evolutionary game\ntheoretic argument purporting to show how certain norms acquire\nnormative force must contain\u2014at least implicitly\u2014a\nnormative statement in the premises. Consequently, this application of\nevolutionary game theory does not provide a neutral analysis of the\nnorm in question, but merely acts as a vehicle for advancing\nparticular values, namely those smuggled in the premises.\n\nThis criticism seems less serious than the charge of irrelevancy.\nCultural evolutionary game theoretic explanations of norms need not\n\u201csmuggle in\u201d normative claims in order to draw normative\nconclusions. The theory already contains, in its core, a proper\nsubtheory having normative content\u2014namely a theory of rational\nchoice in which boundedly rational agents act in order to maximize, as\nbest as they can, their own self-interest. One may challenge the\nsuitability of this as a foundation for the normative content of\ncertain claims, but this is a different criticism from the above\ncharge. Although cultural evolutionary game theoretic models do act as\nvehicles for promulgating certain values, they wear those minimal\nvalue commitments on their sleeve. Evolutionary explanations of social\nnorms have the virtue of making their value commitments explicit and\nalso of showing how other normative commitments (such as fair division\nin certain bargaining situations, or cooperation in the\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma) may be derived from the principled action of\nboundedly rational, self-interested agents.\n",
