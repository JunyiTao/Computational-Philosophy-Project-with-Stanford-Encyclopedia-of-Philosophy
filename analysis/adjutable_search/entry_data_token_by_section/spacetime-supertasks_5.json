The examples of quantum\nmechanical supertasks that have been given so far are somewhat less\nstraightforward than the classical supertasks above. However, they\nalso bear a more interesting possible relationship to physical\nexperiments.\nExample 1: Norton\u2019s Lattice\n\nNorton (1999) investigated whether there exists a direct quantum\nmechanical analogue of the kinds of supertasks discussed above. He\nbegan by considering the classical scenario shown in Figure 1.5.1 of\nan infinite lattice of interacting harmonic oscillators. Assuming the\nsprings all have the same tension and solving the equation of motion\nfor this system, Norton found that it can spontaneously excite,\nproducing an infinite succession of oscillations in the lattice in a\nfinite amount of time.\n\n\nFig 1.5.1. Norton\u2019s infinite harmonic oscillator system.\n\n\nUsing this example as a model, Norton produced a similar supertask for\na quantum lattice of harmonic oscillators. Begin with an infinite\nlattice of 2-dimensional quantum systems, each with a ground state\n\\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) and an excited state \\(\\ket{\\chi}\\). Consider the\ncollection of vectors,\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\ket{0} &= \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\cdots \\\\\n\\ket{1} &= \\ket{\\chi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\cdots \\\\\n\\ket{2} &= \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\chi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\cdots \\\\\n\\ket{3} &= \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\chi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\cdots \\\\\n\\ket{4} &= \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\phi} \\otimes \\ket{\\chi} \\otimes \\cdots \\\\\n\\;\\vdots&\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nFor simplicity, we restrict attention to the possible states of the\nsystem that are spanned by this set. We posit a Hamiltonian that has\nthe effect of leaving |0\u27e9 invariant; of creating |1\u27e9 and\ndestroying |2\u27e9; of creating |2\u27e9 and destroying |3\u27e9; and\nso on. Norton then solved the differential form of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for this interaction and argued that it\nadmits solutions in which all of the nodes in the infinite lattice\nstart in their ground state, but all become spontaneously excited in\nfinite time.\n\nNorton\u2019s quantum supertask requires a non-standard quantum system\nbecause the dynamical evolution he proposes is not unitary, even\nthough it obeys a differential equation in wavefunction space that\ntakes the form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (Norton 1999,\n\u00a75). Nevertheless, Norton\u2019s quantum supertask has fruitfully\nappeared in physical applications, having been found to arise\nnaturally in a framework for perturbative quantum field theory\nproposed by Duncan and Niedermaier (2013, Appendix B).\nExample 2: Hepp Measurement\n\nAlthough quantum systems may sometimes be in a pure superposition of\nmeasurable states, we never observe our measurement devices to be in\nsuch states when they interact with quantum systems. On the contrary, our measurement devices always seem to display definite values. Why? Hepp (1972)\nproposed to explain this by modeling the measurement process using a\nquantum supertask. This example was popularized by Bell (1987,\n\u00a76) and proposed as a solution to the measurement problem by Wan\n(1980) and Bub (1988).\n\nHere is a toy example illustating the idea. Suppose we model an\nidealised measuring device as consisting in an infinite number of\nfermions. We imagine that the fermions do not interact with each\nother, but that a finite number of them will couple to our target\nsystem whenever we make a measurement. Then an observable\ncharacterising the possible outcomes of a given measurement will be a\nproduct corresponding to some finite number n of observables,\n\n\\[\nA = A_1 \\otimes A_2 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes A_n \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes \\cdots\n\\]\n\n\nRestricting to a finite number of fermions at a time has the effect of\nsplitting the Hilbert space of states into special subspaces called\nsuperselection sectors, which have the property that when \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\)\nand \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) come from different sectors, any superposition\n\\(a\\ket{\\psi} + b\\ket{\\phi}\\) with \\(|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1\\) will be a mixed state. It turns out in\nparticular that the space describing the state in which all the\nfermions are \\(z\\)-spin-up is in a different superselection sector than\nthe space in which they are all spin down. Although this may be puzzling\nfor the newcomer, it can be found in any textbook that deals with\nsuperselection. And it allows us to construct an interesting supertask\ndescribing the measurement process. The following simplified version\nof it was given by Bell (1987).\n\nSuppose we wish to measure a single fermion. We model this as a\nwavefunction that zips by the locations of each fermion in our\nmeasurement device, interacting locally with the individual fermions\nin the device as it goes (Figure 1.5.2). The interaction is set up in\nsuch a way that every fermion is passed in finite time, and such that\nafter the process is completed, the measurement device indicates what\nthe original state of the fermion being measured was. In particular,\nsuppose the single fermion begins in a \\(z\\)-spin-up state. Then,\nafter it has zipped by each of the infinite fermions, they will all be\nfound in the \\(z\\)-spin-up state.  If the single fermion begins\nin a \\(z\\)-spin-down state, then the infinite collection of\nfermions would all be \\(z\\)-spin-down. What if the single fermion\nwas in a superposition? Then the infinite collection of fermions would\ncontain some mixture of \\(z\\)-spin up and \\(z\\)-spin down\nstates.\n\n\nFig 1.5.2. Bell\u2019s implementation of the Hepp measurement supertask.\n\n\nHepp found that, because of the superselection structure of this\nsystem, this measurement device admits mixed states that can indicate\nthe original state of the single fermion, even when the latter begins\nin a pure superposition. Suppose we denote the \\(z\\)-spin\nobservable for the nth fermion in the measurement device as, \\(s_n = I\n\\otimes I \\otimes \\cdots (n\\,times) \\cdots \\otimes \\sigma_z \\otimes I\n\\cdots.\\) We now construct a new observable, given by,\n\n\\[\nS = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\tfrac{1}{n}(s_1 + s_2 + \\cdots + s_n).\n\\]\n\n\nThis observable has the property that \\(\\langle \\psi, S\\phi\\rangle =\n1\\) if \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) both lie in the same\nsuperselection sector as the state in which all the fermions in the\nmeasurement device are \\(z\\)-spin-up. It also has the property\nthat \\(\\langle\\psi,S\\phi\\rangle = -1\\) if they lie in the same\nsuperselection sector as the all-down state.  But more interestingly,\nsuppose the target fermion that we want to measure is in a pure\nsuperposition of \\(z\\)-spin-up and \\(z\\)-spin-down\nstates. Then, after it zips by all the fermions in the measurement\ndevice, that measurement device will be left in a superposition of the\nform \\(a\\ket{\\uparrow} + b\\ket{\\downarrow}\\), where \\(\\ket{\\uparrow}\\)\nis the state in which all the fermions in the device are spin-up and\n\\(\\ket{\\downarrow}\\) is the state in which they are all spin\ndown. Since \\(\\ket{\\uparrow}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\downarrow}\\) are in\ndifferent superselection sectors, it follows that their superposition\nmust be a mixed state. In other words, this model allows the\nmeasurement device to indicate the pure state of the target fermion,\neven when that state is a pure superposition, without the device\nitself being in a pure superposition.\n\nThe supertask underpinning this model requires an infinite number of\ninteractions. As Hepp and Bell described it, the model was unrealistic\nbecause it required an infinite amount of time. However, a similar\nsystem was shown by Wan (1980) and Bub (1988) to take place in finite\ntime. Their approach appears at first glance to be a promising model\nof measurement. However, Landsman (1991) pointed out that it is\ninadequate on one of two levels: either the dynamics is not\nautomorphic (which is the analogue of unitarity for such systems), or\nthe task is not completed in finite time. Landsman (1995) has argued\nthat neither of these two outcomes is plausible for a realistic local\ndescription of a quantum system.\nExample 3: Continuous Measurement\n\nAnother quantum supertask is found in the so-called Quantum Zeno\nEffect. This literature begins with a question: what would happen if\nwe were to continually monitor a quantum system, like an unstable\natom? The predicted effect is that the system would not change, even\nif it is an unstable atom that would otherwise quickly decay.\n\nMisra and Sudarshan (1977) proposed to make the concept of\n\u201ccontinual monitoring\u201d precise using a Zeno-like\nsupertask. Imagine that an unstable atom is evolving according to some\nlaw of unitary evolution \\(U_t\\). Suppose we measure whether or\nnot the atom has decayed by following that regressive form of Zeno\u2019s\nDichotomy above. Namely, we measure it at time \\(t\\), but also at time\n\\(t/2\\), and before that at time \\(t/4\\), and at time \\(t/8\\), and so on. Let \\(E\\) be\na projection corresponding to the initial undecayed state of the\nparticle. Finding the atom undecayed at each stage in the supertask\nthen corresponds to the sequence,\n\n\\[\n  EU_tE,\\; EU_{t/2}E,\\; EU_{t/4}E,\\; EU_{t/8}E,\\ldots.\n\\]\n\n\nMisra and Sudarshan use this sequence as a model for continuous\nmeasurement, by supposing that the sequence above converges to an\noperator \\(T(t)=E\\), and that it does so for all times \\(t\\) greater than or\nequal to zero. The aim is for this to capture the claim that the atom\nis continually monitored beginning at a fixed time \\(t=0\\). They prove\nfrom this assumption that, for most reasonable quantum systems, if the\ninitial state is undecayed in the sense that \\(\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho E)=1\\), then the\nprobability that the atom will decay in any given time interval \\([0,t]\\)\nis equal to zero. That is, continual monitoring implies that the atom\nwill never decay.\n\nThese ideas have given rise to a large literature of responses. To\ngive a sampling: Ghirardi et al. (1979) and Pati (1996) have objected\nthat this Zeno-like model of a quantum measurement runs afoul of other\nproperties of quantum theory, such as the time-energy uncertainty\nrelations, which they argue should prevent the measurements in the\nsupertask sequence above from being made with arbitrarily high\nfrequency. Bokulich (2003) has responded that, nevertheless, such a\nsupertask can still be carried out when the measurement commutes with\nthe unitary evolution, such as when \\(E\\) is a projection onto an energy\neigenstate.\n",
