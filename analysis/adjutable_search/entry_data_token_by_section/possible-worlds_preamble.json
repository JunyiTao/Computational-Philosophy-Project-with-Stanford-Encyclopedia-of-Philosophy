    "main_text": "\n\nAnne is working at her desk. While she is directly aware only of her\nimmediate situation \u2014 her being seated in front of her computer,\nthe music playing in the background, the sound of her husband's voice\non the phone in the next room, and so on \u2014 she is quite certain\nthat this situation is only part of a series of increasingly more\ninclusive, albeit less immediate, situations: the situation in her\nhouse as a whole, the one in her neighborhood, the city she lives in,\nthe state, the North American continent, the Earth, the solar system,\nthe galaxy, and so on. On the face of it, anyway, it seems quite\nreasonable to believe that this series has a limit, that is,\nthat there is a maximally inclusive situation encompassing all others:\nthings, as a whole or, more succinctly, the actual\nworld. \n\nMost of us also believe that things, as a whole, needn't have been\njust as they are. Rather, things might have been different in\ncountless ways, both trivial and profound. History, from the very\nbeginning, could have unfolded quite other than it did in fact: the\nmatter constituting a distant star might never have organized well\nenough to give light; species that survived might just as well have\ndied off; battles won might have been lost; children born might never\nhave been conceived and children never conceived might otherwise have\nbeen born. In any case, no matter how things had gone they would still\nhave been part of a single, maximally inclusive, all-encompassing\nsituation, a single world. Intuitively, then, the actual world of\nwhich Anne's immediate situation is a part is only one among many\npossible worlds. \n\nThe idea of possible worlds is evocative and appealing. However,\npossible worlds failed to gain any real traction among philosophers\nuntil the 1960s when they were invoked to provide the conceptual\nunderpinnings of some powerful developments in modal logic. Only then\ndid questions of their nature become a matter of the highest\nphilosophical importance. Accordingly, Part 1 of this article will\nprovide an overview of the role of possible worlds in the development\nof modal logic. Part 2 explores three prominent philosophical\napproaches to the nature of possible\n worlds.[1]\n Although many of the finer philosophical points of Part 2 do\npresuppose the technical background of Part 1, the general\nphilosophical landscape laid out in Part 2 can be appreciated\nindependently of Part 1.\n",
