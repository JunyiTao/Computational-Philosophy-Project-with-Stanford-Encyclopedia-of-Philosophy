Model-theoretic consequence\n\nSuppose \\(L\\) is a language of signature \\(K, T\\) is a set of\nsentences of \\(L\\) and \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence of \\(L\\). Then the\nrelation  \n\n\\[\n\\Mod(T) \\subseteq \\Mod(\\phi)\n\\]\n\n\nexpresses that every structure of signature \\(K\\) which is a model of\n\\(T\\) is also a model of \\(\\phi\\). This is known as the\nmodel-theoretic consequence relation, and it is written for\nshort as  \n\n\\[\nT \\vDash \\phi\n\\]\n\n\nThe double use of \\(\\vDash\\) is a misfortune. But in the particular\ncase where \\(L\\) is first-order, the completeness theorem (see the\nentry on\n classical logic)\n tells us that \u2018\\(T \\vDash \\phi\\)\u2019 holds if and only if\nthere is a proof of \\(\\phi\\) from \\(T\\), a relation commonly\nwritten \n\n\\[\nT \\vdash \\phi\n\\]\n\n\nSince \\(\\vDash\\) and \\(\\vdash\\) express exactly the same relation in\nthis case, model theorists often avoid the double use of \\(\\vDash\\) by\nusing \\(\\vdash\\) for model-theoretic consequence. But since what\nfollows is not confined to first-order languages, safety suggests we\nstick with \\(\\vDash\\) here.\n\nBefore the middle of the nineteenth century, textbooks of logic\ncommonly taught the student how to check the validity of an argument\n(say in English) by showing that it has one of a number of standard\nforms, or by paraphrasing it into such a form. The standard forms were\nsyntactic and/or semantic forms of argument in English. The process\nwas hazardous: semantic forms are almost by definition not visible on\nthe surface, and there is no purely syntactic form that guarantees\nvalidity of an argument. For this reason most of the old textbooks had\na long section on \u2018fallacies\u2019 \u2013 ways in which an\ninvalid argument may seem to be valid.\n\nIn 1847 George Boole changed this arrangement. For example, to\nvalidate the argument\n\nAll monarchs are human beings. No human beings are infallible.\nTherefore no infallible beings are monarchs.\n\n\nBoole would interpret the symbols \\(P, Q, R\\) as names of classes:\n\n\n\\(P\\) is the class of all monarchs.\n\n\\(Q\\) is the class of all human beings.\n\n\\(R\\) is the class of all infallible beings.\n\n\nThen he would point out that the original argument paraphrases into a\nset-theoretic consequence:  \n\n\\[\n(P \\subseteq Q), (Q \\cap R = 0) \\vDash(R \\cap P = 0)\n\\]\n\n\n(This example is from Stanley Jevons, 1869. Boole\u2019s own account\nis idiosyncratic, but I believe Jevons\u2019 example represents\nBoole\u2019s intentions accurately.) Today we would write \\(\\forall\nx(Px \\rightarrow Qx)\\) rather than \\(P \\subseteq Q\\), but this is\nessentially the standard definition of \\(P \\subseteq Q\\), so the\ndifference between us and Boole is slight. \n\nInsofar as they follow Boole, modern textbooks of logic establish that\nEnglish arguments are valid by reducing them to model-theoretic\nconsequences. Since the class of model-theoretic consequences, at\nleast in first-order logic, has none of the vaguenesses of the old\nargument forms, textbooks of logic in this style have long since\nceased to have a chapter on fallacies.\n\nBut there is one warning that survives from the old textbooks: If you\nformalise your argument in a way that is not a\nmodel-theoretic consequence, it doesn\u2019t mean the argument is\nnot valid. It may only mean that you failed to analyse the\nconcepts in the argument deeply enough before you formalised. The old\ntextbooks used to discuss this in a ragbag section called\n\u2018topics\u2019 (i.e. hints for finding arguments that you might\nhave missed). Here is an example from Peter of Spain\u2019s 13th\ncentury Summulae Logicales:\n\n\u2018There is a father. Therefore there is a child.\u2019 \u2026\nWhere does the validity of this argument come from? From the relation.\nThe maxim is: When one of a correlated pair is posited, then so is the\nother.\n\n\nHilbert and Ackermann, possibly the textbook that did most to\nestablish the modern style, discuss in their section III.3 a very\nsimilar example: \u2018If there is a son, then there is a\nfather\u2019. They point out that any attempt to justify this by\nusing the symbolism  \n\n\\[\n\\exists xSx \\rightarrow \\exists xFx\n\\]\n\n\nis doomed to failure. \u201cA proof of this statement is possible\nonly if we analyze conceptually the meanings of the two predicates\nwhich occur\u201d, as they go on to illustrate. And of course the\nanalysis finds precisely the relation that Peter of Spain referred to.\n\n\nOn the other hand if your English argument translates into an invalid\nmodel-theoretic consequence, a counterexample to the consequence may\nwell give clues about how you can describe a situation that would make\nthe premises of your argument true and the conclusion false. But this\nis not guaranteed.\n\nOne can raise a number of questions about whether the modern textbook\nprocedure does really capture a sensible notion of logical\nconsequence. For example in Boole\u2019s case the set-theoretic\nconsequences that he relies on are all easily provable by formal\nproofs in first-order logic, not even using any set-theoretic axioms;\nand by the completeness theorem (see the entry on\n classical logic)\n the same is true for first-order logic. But for some other logics it\nis certainly not true. For instance the model-theoretic consequence\nrelation for some logics of time presupposes some facts about the\nphysical structure of time. Also, as Boole himself pointed out, his\ntranslation from an English argument to its set-theoretic form\nrequires us to believe that for every property used in the argument,\nthere is a corresponding class of all the things that have the\nproperty. This comes dangerously close to Frege\u2019s inconsistent\ncomprehension axiom!\n\nIn 1936 Alfred Tarski proposed a definition of logical consequence for\narguments in a fully interpreted formal language. His proposal was\nthat an argument is valid if and only if: under any allowed\nreinterpretation of its nonlogical symbols, if the premises are true\nthen so is the conclusion. Tarski assumed that the class of allowed\nreinterpretations could be read off from the semantics of the\nlanguage, as set out in his\n truth definition.\n He left it undetermined what symbols count as nonlogical; in fact he\nhoped that this freedom would allow one to define different kinds of\nnecessity, perhaps separating \u2018logical\u2019 from\n\u2018analytic\u2019. One thing that makes Tarski\u2019s proposal\ndifficult to evaluate is that he completely ignores the question we\ndiscussed above, of analysing the concepts to reach all the logical\nconnections between them. The only plausible explanation I can see for\nthis lies in his parenthetical remark about\n\nthe necessity of eliminating any defined signs which may possibly\noccur in the sentences concerned, i.e. of replacing them by primitive\nsigns.\n\n\nThis suggests to me that he wants his primitive signs to be by\nstipulation unanalysable. But then by stipulation it will be\npurely accidental if his notion of logical consequence captures\neverything one would normally count as a logical consequence. \n\nHistorians note a resemblance between Tarski\u2019s proposal and one\nin section 147 of Bernard Bolzano\u2019s Wissenschaftslehre\nof 1837. Like Tarski, Bolzano defines the validity of a proposition in\nterms of the truth of a family of related propositions. Unlike Tarski,\nBolzano makes his proposal for propositions in the vernacular, not for\nsentences of a formal language with a precisely defined semantics.\n\nOn all of this section, see also the entry on\n logical consequence.\n",
