    "main_text": "How to Atone || Repentance\n2.2 Repentance\n\nOne repents of a wrong action when one\n\nadmits that one performed the action in question,\nadmits that the action was wrong,\nadmits that one bears at least some blame for having performed the\naction, and\nresolves to amend one\u2019s ways (Swinburne 1989: 82).\n\n\nThe resolution to amend one\u2019s ways includes a resolution to make\namends to the victim, and a resolution to not perform similar actions\nin the future. The latter resolution may require one to repudiate and\nseek to change aspects of one\u2019s character (J. Murphy 2003). The\nGreek word that translates as \u201crepentance\u201d is\n\u201cmetanoia\u201d, which means to make a fundamental change of\none\u2019s mind or outlook. A repentant person changes her outlook\nabout her past actions for the right reason; you\u2019re not\nrepentant if you decide to amend your ways not because you care at all\nabout being blameworthy for having done something wrong, but because\nyou don\u2019t want to be caught, or you don\u2019t want to be\nthought of poorly. One repents when one resolves to amend one\u2019s\nways because of how one has blameworthily wronged another person.\n\nThere is also an emotional component to repentance. Someone who is\nrepentant has remorse and guilt about her wrong action (J. Murphy\n2012b). She also experiences sympathy towards her victim (Bovens\n2008), sadness at having acted wrongly, and\n contrition.[17]\n\nRepentance contributes to atonement in various ways. It is a necessary\ningredient of a genuine apology. Repentance is a prerequisite for\nmoral and thicker sorts of reconciliation. Moral reconciliation\ninvolves entering into a relationship of mutual moral respect and it\nseems that a wrongdoer does not respect a victim by refraining from\nrepenting. The wrongdoer has an obligation to fix what can be fixed\nabout the wrong action and its effects; one thing that can be fixed is\nthe insult to the victim. By repenting, the wrongdoer begins to\nwithdraw the insult.\n\nMany theological approaches to repentance share the above features,\nbut regard repentance as a more general rejection of sin and embrace\nof God\u2019s goodness. For example, repentance in both Roman\nCatholic Christianity and Sufi Islam requires\n (i)\u2014(iv)\n above together with emotions of contrition, regret, and sadness\ntowards sin. Both, however, also regard repentance as interior\nconversion: rejecting living in sin and embracing a new way of life\nfollowing God (Catechism of the Catholic Church 1431 [2.2.2.4.IV,\n Other Internet Resources];\n Khalil 2018).\n",
