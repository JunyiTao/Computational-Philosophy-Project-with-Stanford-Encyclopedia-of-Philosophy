    "main_text": "Toward a Trans/Feminism || Evil Deceivers and Make-Believers\n10.3 Evil Deceivers and Make-Believers\n Talia Mae Bettcher (2012a; 2013; 2014) argues against both the\ntraditional wrong-body account of transsexuality (in which gender\nidentity is taken as innate, allegedly determining one's\n\u201creal\u201d sex) and the newer, beyond-the-binary vision that\nemerged with the new transgender politics of the\nnineteen-nineties. Both accounts invalidate trans identities, she\nargues - the first, by invalidating the self-identities of trans\npeople who do not regard their genitals as wrong, the second, by\nrepresenting all trans people as problematically positioned with\nregard to the binary (2013, 53). Moreover, both accounts fail on their\nown terms. While beyond-the-binary politics tend to marginalize trans\npeople who position themselves within the binary, and therefore fails\nas a complete account of trans oppression and resistance (2014, 387),\nthe wrong-body account fails to secure trans identity claims to belong\nto their preferred gender categories (for example, she argues,\naccording to the dominant meaning of woman, an MTF who has had genital\nreconstruction surgery is at best a difficult case (possibly a man\nowing to chromosomes, possibly a woman owing to genitalia) (2014,\n386). Bettcher's aim (2012a, 2014), then, is to provide an account of\ntrans politics that does not marginalize trans people who situate\nthemselves within the binary and that successfully grounds their\nself-identity claims.\n\n\nInstead of attempting to justify trans self-identity claims, Bettcher\n(2012a) argues, such claims ought to be accepted as presumptively\nvalid as a starting-point of trans theory and politics (245-6). She\nadopts the general view that (many) trans people tend to oppose the\nmeanings of mainstream gender terms and practices. In many trans\nsubcultures, she argues, the meaning of terms such as woman\nand man are altered so that both trans men and trans women\nturn out to paradigm instances of men and women respectively\n(241). For example possession of XY chromosomes does not count against\ntrans woman's claim to womanhood insofar as a trans woman is a kind of\nwoman who tends to have XY chromosomes. As a consequence of this, an\nMTF may count as a man in mainstream culture while she may count as a\nwoman in a resistant trans subculture (242). More deeply, Bettcher\nargues (2009, 110-12), the shift in meaning involves not only an\nexpansion of the category, but also a change in use, reflected in the\ngrammar of first and third person assertions. It is no longer merely a\nquestion whether the category is truthfully predicated of the object\nin question. Instead, there is a first person, present tense avowal of\ngender. For example, the claim \u201cI am a trans woman\u201d may be\nan avowal of a deep sense of \u201cwho one is\u201d (that is, of one's\ndeepest values and commitments) where defeasible avowals of gender are\npresumptively taken as authoritative (2009, 110-12). The political\nconflict, at any rate, is framed in terms of competing cultural\nformations where the dominant one possesses institutional power and\nthe capacity to enforce a way of life and way of seeing the world,\nregardless of the personal costs to the trans people involved and\nregardless of subcultural socially practices which help give their\nlives meaning (2009, 115; 2012, 243; 2013, 53-54; 2014, 388-90). (One\nnotable absence, in this view, is any account of how it is that trans\npeople are motivated to transition and to occupy such trans cultural\nspaces in the first place. That is, there is no account of underlying\ngender dysphoria).\n\n\nBettcher characterizes the nature of trans oppression largely in terms\nof a form of transphobia she in earlier work calls the Basic Denial of\nAuthenticity (BDA) (2006b, 181) and in later work, reality enforcement\n(2013, 58-9; 2014, 392). In this type of transphobia, the identity\ninvalidation of trans men and trans women is situated in discourses\nabout appearance, reality, exposure, discovery, and deception. For\nexample, a trans woman may be viewed as \u201creally a man disguised\nas a woman.\u201d Importantly, for Bettcher, the invalidation is\nconnected to forms of genital verification. Explicit genital\nverification involves literally exposing or touching the trans person\ninappropriately to determined \u201cwhat they are really.\u201d\nImplicit genital verification involves euphemistic questions and\nclaims (\u201cHave you had the surgery?\u201d \u201cAre you male or\nfemale?\u201d). Reality enforcement takes two forms given by the\npossibilities of the trans person being visibly trans or passing as\nnon-trans. In the latter case, trans individuals may be viewed as\ndeceptive (when \u201cexposed\u201d), while in the former case they\nmay be viewed as playing at harmless make-believe. Either way, she\nargues, trans self-identities are invalidated (2007, 50-51).\n Bettcher argues that an account of transphobia which appeals only\nto the imposition of a strict man/woman binary cannot account for\nreality enforcement and leads to a restricted and problematic vision\nof trans politics. Such identity invalidations often do not involve\nperplexity on the part of the transphobe about how to situate the\ntrans person categorically. On the contrary, trans people are viewed\nas \u201creally men\u201d or \u201creally women\u201d (2006b,\n184-7). Moreover, she critiques transgender politics of\nvisibility. For given that reality enforcement always produces a\ndouble-bind, Bettcher argues, such a politics may not always be\npromising. Indeed, if it is impossible for trans people to tell the\ntruth because whatever they do (\u201cpass\u201d as non-trans or\n\u201ccome out\u201d as trans) yields the view that they are\nfraudulent deceivers or pretenders, then it seems that it is not\npossible to tell the truth in the first place(2006b, 188-90, 195). If\nso, the demand to \u201ctell the truth about oneself\u201d would\nseem misplaced.\n\n\nBettcher argues that by recognizing reality enforcement and resistant\nresponses to it, the perceived conflict (discussed earlier in this\nentry) between theories which reduce gender to a social construction\nand the political necessity of taking seriously trans identities which\nclaim gender realness can be better mitigated. Insofar as reality\nenforcement has sway, trans people are inevitably constructed as\nfrauds or fakes (2006b, 194). But the general claim that all gender is\nsocially constructed simply does not address the specific ways in\nwhich trans people are constructed as fraudulent. Bettcher argues that\nonce we recognize reality enforcement trans people who contest such\ninvalidation by claiming gender realness may also be viewed as\nresistant to transphobic oppression, thereby undermining the tendency\n(present in Butler) to dismiss such individuals as merely gender\nreactionary or conservative (2014, 397-99). Indeed, the Wrong-Body\nAccount itself may be viewed as response to reality enforcement\nthrough a kind of inversion where the body is now viewed as the\ndeceptive appearance which hides the true, concealed gender identity\n(2014, 399-404).\n\n\nA central thesis in Bettcher's account is that reality enforcement is\nexplained by the fact that gender presentation (taken as\n\u201cappearance\u201d) literally signifies physical sex and in\nparticular, genital status (taken as \u201cdeep reality\u201d). If it\nis true that trans people who \u201cmisalign\u201d gender presentation\nwith sexed body are deceivers or pretenders, then those who\n\u201ccorrectly\u201d align presentation with body tell the truth. In\nlight of this, Bettcher argues, there is a representational relation\nbetween gender presentation and sexed body (2007, 52-3). Bettcher\ndraws attention to the irony that attire is intended to conceal one's\n\u201cprivates\u201d while it also serves to symbolically reveal that\nwhich is private (2007, 53). Insofar as it is invasive to demand\nprivate bodily information of a complete stranger, she argues, a\nsystem, enforced by violence which requires the disclosure of genital\nstatus is inherently abusive. In light of this, she argues, reality\nenforcement is inherently bound up with sexual abuse (2006a,\n205-6).\n\nBettcher introduces the notion of intimate\npersonhood (2012b) to further illuminate reality enforcement and its\ngrounding in gender presentation as genital representation. In this\nview, people are given to us through forms of sensory (and discursive)\naccess that admit of interpersonal closeness (intimacy) and distance\n(324). This access, she argues, and therefore intimate personhood\nitself, requires the existence of normative interpersonal boundaries\non sensory access to bodies, while the actual structure of boundaries\nis culturally contingent (325). In our culture, nakedness as a social\npossibility and a form of self-presentation, she argues, is just as\nsocially-constructed as (public) gender presentation (322). It is\ndetermined by the subjection of bodies to sex-differential boundaries\nof privacy and decency boundaries which protect both the object and\nsubject of sensory access and which provide the underlying rationale\nfor public concealment (322-3). Female nipples, for example are\nsubject to boundaries on sensory access while male nipples are\nnot. Moreover, while a man seeing a woman's genitals may constitute a\nviolation of her privacy, a woman seeing a man's may involve his\ncommitting an indecency offense against her (327). Thus, in her view,\njust as there are two forms of public gender presentation, so there\nare two sex-differentiated forms of nakedness (326) and her central\nthesis that gender presentation communicates genital status becomes\nthe more refined view that clothed gender presentation represents\nnaked gender presentation through euphemistic means (329-330).\n Bettcher argues that this gender-genital representational relation\nis part of a larger non-verbal system of communication that is used in\nmanipulative heterosexual sexuality. For example, feminine attire has\nbeen used to excuse rape in \u201cshe asked for it\u201d\ndefenses. In Bettcher's view, gender presentation as genital\nrepresentation is of a piece with this type of sexual\n\u201ccommunication\u201d: One reason for the communication of\ngenital status is to secure manipulative heterosexual sexuality (2007,\n56). Notably, this yields specific difficulties for trans women which\narise at the intersections of sexism and transphobia. For example, a\ntrans woman who is passing as non-trans may be subject to sexualized\nscrutiny (increasing her chances of being \u201cread\u201d) (2006a,\n207). Moreover, the very behavior which opens her to the double-binded\nmanipulations of (hetero) sexuality may appear necessarily in order to\navoid being exposed as a \u201cdeceiver\u201d (2006a, 207).\n\n\nBettcher points to ways in which racist ideology, rape, and racist\naccusations of rape intersect with each other. Consider the raping of\nblack women by white men and the lynching of black men (justified\nthrough false accusation of having raped white women) as historical\ntactics of racial subordination. Bettcher argues since reality\nenforcement is involved in broader relations of sexual violence and\nsince such violence has been interwoven with racial injustice, reality\nenforcement is likewise grounded in racial oppression (2007,\n57). Indeed, Bettcher suggests that attempts to address transphobia\nwhich fail to take seriously the realities of racial oppression (by\nworking uncritically with the criminal justice system, for example)\nare bound to fail (2007, 58\u201360).  Bettcher concludes that her\naccount can serve as a theoretical basis for anti-racist trans and\nnon-trans feminist solidarity (2007, 57\u20138).  It can also\nelucidate transphobic feminist representations of trans women as\ndeceivers and rapists as fundamentally drawing on a (hetero) sexist,\nsexually abusive, and rape-facilitating system in which gender\npresentation communicates genital status. Given the interconnection\nbetween reality enforcement and sexist and racist forms of oppression,\nit behooves non-trans feminists to question the political value of\ndeploying such representations.\n",
