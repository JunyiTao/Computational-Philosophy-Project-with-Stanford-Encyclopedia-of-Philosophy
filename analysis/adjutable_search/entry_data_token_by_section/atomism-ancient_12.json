    "main_text": "The Legacy of Ancient Atomism || Atomism in the Islamic World\n3.1 Atomism in the Islamic World\n\nBeginning in the late 8th century CE/2nd century AH),\ndifferent versions of atomism were adopted and developed by many\nadherents of the Islamic schools of kal\u0101m or theology.\nThe most important of these early atomist schools were located in\nBasra and Baghdad. The philosopher-physician Ab\u016b Bakr\nal-R\u0101z\u012b (d. 313/925) also developed an atomist theory (Pines\n1997; Baffioni 1982; Adamson 2014; Koetschet 2019), although adherents\nof the philosophical schools known as falsafa more commonly\nadhered to a philosophical picture based on Neoplatonic continuum\nmetaphysics. Some medieval Jewish philosophers of the Karaite school,\nwriting in Arabic and influenced by kal\u0101m thought,\nadopted atomist views (Ben-Shammai, 1985). Critics of\nkal\u0101m atomism include Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, the\n11th/5th century philosopher known as Avicenna\nin the West, and Maimonides (12th/6th C) in his Guide for the\nPerplexed. Fakhr al-d\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b responded to Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s criticisms in the 12th/6th century (Dhanani\n2015), and atomist ideas were publicized by the work of al-Ij\u012b\n(d. 1355 CE) and his student al-Taftazani, which present arguments\nfrom earlier kalam and falsafa natural philosophy\nand were used for teaching purposes (Dhanani 2017).\n\nAlthough the loss of texts makes it difficult to trace the origins of\natomism in Islamic thought, scholars argue that ancient Greek theories\nmay have reached the Mutakallimun by oral transmission if not\nby translation of texts; the indirect transmission may explain some\ndivergences (Wolfson 1976; Dhanani 1994). Epicurean rather than\nDemocritean ideas may have been transmitted through doxographies (van\nEss 2018) or from Galen\u2019s critiques (Langermann 2009); other\npossible routes of transmission that have been explored include the\nGreek sceptical tradition and the supposed atomism of the Pythagorean\nEcphantus (Baffioni 1982). Attempts have also been made to link\nkal\u0101m atomism to the Indian tradition (Pines 1997;\nWolfson 1976): echoes include a similar argument that a mountain and a\nmustard seed would be equal if bodies were infinitely divisible, and\nthe fact that perceptible properties are ascribed to atoms, in\ncontrast to the Greek tradition. Whatever its antecedents, the\ndevelopment of atomism in an Islamic context\u2014where different\nphilosophical questions prevailed\u2014led to creative innovations\nand a distinctive critical tradition of atomist thought (Rashed\n2005).\n\nUnlike Greek atomists, Abu al-Hudhayl\u2014regarded as the founder of\nkal\u0101m atomism\u2014posited that atoms were\nindiscernible from one another even in size or shape. Rashed (2005)\nargues for the distinctness of al-Hudhayl\u2019s atoms from both\nancient Greek or Indian antecedents, since atoms were conceived as\nEuclidean points and not as extended material bodies. Rashed stresses\nthe importance of the conception of atoms as in motion at an\ninstant, connecting it to the development of a notion that bodies\noccupying infinitesimal locations could possess motion as a dynamic\nproperty, and to a treatment of mathematical properties that were not\nmerely regarded as abstracted from bodies, as in the Aristotelian\ntradition (Rashed 2005). Al-Nazz\u0101n, a prominent early critic of\natomism, tried to solve paradoxes about motion over infinitely\ndivisible continua with the alternative thesis that motion consisted\nin an imperceptible \u2018leap\u2019 from one location to\nanother.\n\nBecause any Islamic metaphysical system was committed to a Creator\nGod, the ancient Greek use of atomism to solve the problem of change\nwithout something coming from nothing could not be the motivation for\nkal\u0101m atomism. Some scholars believe the created nature\nof atoms could have been used as an argument for the existence of God,\nsince creation implies a Creator (Adamson 2016, 16). Atoms could not\ncontinue existing on their own but were continually recreated by God\nat every instant. Al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s atomism, by contrast,\ndenied that creation from nothing was possible and supposed that atoms\nwere eternal (Pines 1997, 48). Baffioni (1982) contrasts\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s physical motivations for adopting atomism\nwith the \u2018teleological\u2019 atomism of the kal\u0101m\nschools.\n\nCentral debates about the viability of atomism in the Islamic world\ncentred on infinite divisibility, applying paradoxes similar to those\nof Zeno to the problem of an ant crawling over a sandal. A problem\nabout the fact that different particles in a rolling millstone or\nwheel must be moving at different speeds, despite the apparent\ncohesiveness of the millstone, is found in Islamic discussions. The\ninsistence within kal\u0101m atomism on recognizing accidents\nthat adhere in the whole of composite bodies, and that cannot be\ntraced back to the properties of individual atoms, may share the\nmotivation of Epicurus\u2019 attempt to avoid the eliminativism of\nDemocritus\u2019 theory. Likewise, epistemological arguments for\npreserving confidence in sense perception, even given the possibility\nof illusion, may have been formulated to avoid the sceptical potential\ninherent in a Democritean approach to perception and empirical\nknowledge.\n\nAtoms in Islamic philosophy were typically defined by the occupation\nof space and the exclusion of other bodies; by their ability to\nreceive accidents; and by their ability to be perceived by the senses\nof sight and touch, presumably in sufficiently large aggregates. The\nassertion of an entailment between materiality and occupying space was\napparently directed against the Peripatetic notion of matter and the\nAristotelian notion of natural place (Dhanani 1994, 88\u201389). The\nspatial extendedness of atoms was also linked to the notion that atoms\nserved as a unit for measuring extension. Because spherical atoms\npacked together would leave a space that is smaller than the\natom\u2014which would be impossible if atoms represented the smallest\npossible magnitude\u2014atoms were said to be cubic (Dhanani 1994,\n115). Atoms were thought to adhere to one another without the physical\n\u2018hooks\u2019 proposed by Democritus; even so, it proved\ndifficult to avoid ascribing subatomic parts to atoms.\n\nAs in the Greek tradition, the positing of atoms in Islamic thought\nwas paired with assertions about the existence of void space, in\nopposition to the continuum physics characteristic of most\nfalsafa thought (cf. Pines 1979). Debate over the existence\nof void was enriched by the need to explain the operation of so-called\npneumatic devices like the siphon, medical cupping glasses or syringe\n(Lugal and Sayili 1951; Koetschet 2019). The supposed impossibility of\nvoid space forming was used to account for observed fluid movements in\npneumatic devices, raising questions about how a metaphysical\nimpossibility might produce physical motions. Ingenious thought\nexperiments were developed to test the assumptions at work, asking\nwhat would happen if a single film of atoms were trapped between two\ncupping glasses, or comparing the effect of cupping glasses on stone\nto their effect on flesh (Dhanani 1994, 77). The fascination with\npneumatic technology in the medieval Islamic world is attested in\nsurviving texts which detail increasingly complex marvels: trick\nfountains, surprise vessels, water clocks with elaborate mechanical\nside-shows (Hill 1974, 1979), although the explanation of these\neffects did not necessarily involve atomist or particle theories of\nmatter. \n",
