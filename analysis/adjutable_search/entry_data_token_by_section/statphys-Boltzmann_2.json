Even to those who consider the\nconcept of ensembles as the most important tool of statistical\nphysics, and claim Gibbs rather than Boltzmann as their champion, it\nhas been pointed out that Boltzmann introduced ensembles long before\nGibbs. And those who advocate Boltzmann while rejecting ergodic\ntheory, may similarly be reminded that the latter theory too\noriginated with Boltzmann himself.\n\n\nIt appears, therefore, that Boltzmann is the father of many\napproaches, even if these approaches are presently seen as conflicting\nwith each other. This is due to the fact that during his forty years of\nwork on the subject, Boltzmann pursued many lines of thought.\nTypically, he would follow a particular train of thought that he regarded\npromising and fruitful, only to discard it in the next paper for\nanother one, and then pick it up again years later. This meandering\napproach is of course not unusual among theoretical physicists but it\nmakes it hard to pin down Boltzmann on a particular set of rock-bottom\nassumptions, that would reveal his true colors in the modern debate on\nthe foundations of statistical physics. The Ehrenfests (1912) in their\nfamous Encyclopedia article, set themselves the task of constructing a\nmore or less coherent framework out of Boltzmann's legacy. But their\npresentation of Boltzmann was, as is rather well known, not\nhistorically adequate.\n\n\nWithout going into a more detailed description of the landscape of the\nbattlefield of the foundations of statistical physics, or a sketch of\nthe various positions occupied, it might be useful to mention only the\nroughest of distinctions. I use the term \u2018statistical\nphysics\u2019 as a deliberately vague term that includes at least two\nmore sharply distinguished theories: the kinetic theory of gases and\nstatistical mechanics proper.\n\n\nThe first theory aims to explain the properties of gases by assuming\nthat they consist of a very large number of molecules in rapid motion.\n(The term \u2018kinetic\u2019 is meant to underline the vital\nimportance of motion here, and to distinguish the approach from older\nstatic molecular gas models.) During the 1860s probability\nconsiderations were imported into this theory. The aim then became to\ncharacterize the properties of gases, in particular in thermal\nequilibrium, in terms of probabilities of various molecular\nstates. This is what the Ehrenfests call \u201ckineto-statistics of the\nmolecule\u201d. Here, molecular states, in particular their velocities, are\nregarded as stochastic variables, and probabilities are attached to\nsuch molecular states of motion. These probabilities themselves are\nconceived of as mechanical properties of the state of the total gas\nsystem. Either they represent the relative number of\nmolecules with a particular state, or the relative time\nduring which a molecule has that state.\n\n\nIn the course of time a transition was made to what the Ehrenfests\ncalled \u201ckineto-statistics of the gas model\u201d, or what is nowadays\nknown as statistical mechanics. In this latter approach, probabilities\nare not attached to the state of a molecule but of the entire gas\nsystem. Thus, the state of the gas, instead of determining the\nprobability distribution, now itself becomes a stochastic variable.\n\n\nA merit of this latter approach is that interactions between molecules\ncan be taken into account. Indeed, the approach is not restricted to\ngases, but also applicable to liquids or solids. The price to be paid,\nhowever, is that the probabilities themselves become more\nabstract. Since probabilities are attributed to the mechanical states\nof the total system, they are no longer determined by such mechanical\nstates. Instead, in statistical mechanics, the probabilities are\nusually determined by means of an \u2018ensemble\u2019, i.e., a\nfictitious collection of replicas of the system in question.\n\n\nIt is not easy to pinpoint this transition in the course of history,\nexcept to say that in Maxwell's work in the 1860s definitely belong to\nthe first category, and Gibbs' book of 1902 to the second. Boltzmann's\nown works fall somewhere in the middle. His earlier contributions\nclearly belong to the kinetic theory of gases (although his 1868 paper\nalready applies probability to an entire gas system), while his work\nof 1877 is usually seen as belonging to statistical\nmechanics. However, Boltzmann himself never indicated a clear\ndistinction between these two different theories, and any attempt to\ndraw a demarcation at an exact location in his work seems somewhat\narbitrary.\n\n\nFrom a conceptual point of view, the transition from kinetic gas\ntheory to statistical mechanics poses two main foundational questions.\nOn what grounds do we choose a particular ensemble, or the probability\ndistribution characterizing the system? Gibbs did not enter into a\nsystematic discussion of this problem, but only discussed special\ncases of equilibrium ensembles (i.e. canonical, micro-canonical\netc.). A second problem is to relate the ensemble-based probabilities\nwith the probabilities obtained in the earlier kinetic approach for a\nsingle gas model.\n\n\nThe Ehrenfests (1912) paper was the first to recognize these\nquestions, and to provide a partial answer: Assuming a certain\nhypothesis of Boltzmann's, which they dubbed the ergodic\nhypothesis, they pointed out that for an isolated system the\nmicro-canonical distribution is the unique stationary probability\ndistribution. Hence, if one demands that an ensemble of isolated\nsystems describing thermal equilibrium must be represented by a\nstationary distribution, the only choice for this purpose is the\nmicro-canonical one. Similarly, they pointed out that under the\nergodic hypothesis infinite time averages and ensemble averages were\nidentical. This, then, would provide a desired link between the\nprobabilities of the older kinetic gas theory and those of statistical\nmechanics, at least in equilibrium and in the infinite time limit. Yet\nthe Ehrenfests simultaneously expressed strong doubts about the\nvalidity of the ergodic hypothesis. These doubts were soon\nsubstantiated when in 1913 Rozenthal and Plancherel proved that the\nhypothesis was untenable for realistic gas models.\n\n\nThe Ehrenfests' reconstruction of Boltzmann's work thus gave a\nprominent role to the ergodic hypothesis, suggesting that it played a\nfundamental and lasting role in his thinking. Although this view\nindeed produces a more coherent view of his multifaceted work, it is\ncertainly not historically correct. Boltzmann himself also had grave\ndoubts about this hypothesis, and expressly avoided it whenever he\ncould, in particular in his two great papers of 1872 and 1877b. Since\nthe Ehrenfests, many other authors have presented accounts of\nBoltzmann's work. Particularly important are Klein (1973) and Brush\n(1976). Still, much confusion remains about what exactly his approach\nto statistical physics was, and how it developed. For a more elaborate\nattempt to sketch the general landscape, and Boltzmann's work in\nparticular,I refer to (Uffink 2007). \n",
