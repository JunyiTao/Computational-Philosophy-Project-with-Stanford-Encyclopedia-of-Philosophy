In the mid 1800s the word algebra meant, for most mathematicians, \nsimply the algebra of numbers. \n\nBoole\u2019s three laws for his algebra of logic are woefully inadequate\nfor what follows in MAL. The reader will, for the most part,\nbe well served by assuming that Boole is doing ordinary polynomial\nalgebra augmented by the assumption that any power\n\\(x^n\\) of an elective symbol \\(x\\) can be replaced by \\(x\\). \nOne can safely assume that any polynomial equation p = q that holds \nin Common Algebra is valid\nin Boole\u2019s algebra as is any equational argument\n\n\\[\np_1 = q_1, \\ldots, p_k = q_k \\therefore p = q\n\\]\n\n\nthat holds in Common Algebra.\n\n[A note of caution: the argument \n\u201c\\(x^2 = x \\therefore x = 1\\) or\n\\(x = 0\\)\u201d is valid in Common Algebra, but it is \nnot an\nequational argument since the conclusion is a disjunction of\nequations, not a single equation.] \n\nBoole\u2019s algebra\nwas mainly concerned with polynomials with integer coefficients, and\nwith their values when the variables were restricted to taking on only\nthe values 0 and 1.\nSome of the key polynomials in Boole\u2019s work, \nalong with their values\non \\(\\{0,1\\}\\), are presented in the following table:\n\n\n\\(x\\) \\(y\\)\n \\(1 - x\\) \n \\(x - x^2\\) \n \\(xy\\) \n \\(x + y\\) \n \\(x - y\\) \n \\(x+y - xy\\)\n \\(x+y - 2xy\\)\n\n\n1 1\n0 0\n1 2 0\n1 0\n\n\n1 0\n0 0\n0 1 1\n1 1\n\n\n0 1\n1 0\n0 1 \\(-1\\)\n1 1\n\n\n0 0\n1 0\n0 0 0\n0 0\n\n\n\n\nNote that all of the polynomials \\(p\\)(x,y) in the above\ntable, except for addition and subtraction, take values in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) when\nthe variables take values in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\). Such polynomials are called\nswitching functions in computer science and electrical\nengineering, and as functions on \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) they are idempotent, that is,\np\\(^2 =\\) p. The switching functions are exactly\nthe idempotent polynomials in Boole\u2019s algebra.\n",
