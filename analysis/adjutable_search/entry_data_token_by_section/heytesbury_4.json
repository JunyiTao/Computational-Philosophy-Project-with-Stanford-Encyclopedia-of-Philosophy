    "main_text": "Logic || Logic of Epistemic Statements\n2.4 Logic of Epistemic Statements\n\nHeytesbury\u2019s analysis of epistemic statements encompasses the\nlogical analysis of epistemic statements, inference rules for\nsentences containing epistemic operators, and rules for obligational\ngames with epistemic statements, most of which are applied to\nsolutions to\n sophisms[24]\n and instructions for obligational games. The underlying principles\npertaining to the logical analysis of language and inference rules for\nepistemic statements will be addressed\n below.[25]\n2.4.1 De re/de dicto Ambiguity and Epistemic Statements\n\nLet us consider the following two sentences:\n\n(dr)\nSocrates I know to be running in Beaumont.\n(dd)\nI know that Socrates is running in Beaumont.\n\n\n(dr), called \u201csensus divisus\u201d by Heytesbury,\ndenotes that there is a person (who happens to be Socrates) of whom I\ncorrectly know that he is running in Beaumont, but about whom I may or\nmay not know that he is Socrates; his kinematics, but not his\nidentity, is part of my belief. On the other hand, according to (dd),\ncalled \u201csensus compositus\u201d by Heytesbury, I know\nthat it is Socrates who is running in Beaumont. Hence if I believed\nthat Socrates died years ago, (dr) could be true but (dd) would be\nfalse ([SCD] 1494: fol. 3va [1988a: 427] and [RSS] 1494, fol. 13rb and\n[1988b:\n 444]).[26]\n By strictly endorsing the Aristotelian framework and analyzing\nepistemic contexts in terms of the de re/de dicto\nambiguity, Heytesbury does not participate in the fourteenth-century\ndevelopments in the logical analysis of\n language.[27]\n Also, his criteria for distinguishing between the two readings are\npurely syntactic, whereby scholastic Latin is viewed as an artificial\nlanguage with strict formation\n rules.[28]\n2.4.2 Inference Rules\n\nHeytesbury\u2019s remarks on the \u201ccommon interpretation of\nknowledge\u201d emphasize that a firm and unhesitant belief does not\nconstitute knowledge unless it is veridical, which results in the\nformulation \u201cto know is nothing other than unhesitatingly to\napprehend the truth\u2014i.e., to believe unhesitatingly that it is\nso when it is so in reality\u201d ([RSS] 1494: fol. 13vb [1988b:\n 447]).[29]\n This implies the veracity of knowledge:\n\n(T)\nif \u03be knows that X, then X is the\n case.[30]\n\n\nThe introspection axioms govern iterated epistemic modalities (Boh\n1984 and 1985, Hanke 2018a). While denying the possibility of doubting\none\u2019s own knowledge, Heytesbury proposes what is an equivalent\nto positive introspection:\n\n(4)\nif the agent \u03be perceives that X and \u03be is\nconsidering whether \u03be perceives that X, then \u03be\nperceives that he perceives that X.\n\n\nAs perception is in this context replaceable with knowledge, the\nprinciple is equivalent to its modern counterpart, save the emphasis\non active consideration of the problem (i.e., attention), which\nappears to correct the principle for the limitations of human agents.\nThe principles for both first and second-order knowledge are based on\nthe same evidence ([RSS] 1494: fol. 13vb [1988b: 447\u2013448]).\nHeytesbury also holds the contraposition of (4) ([RSS] 1494: fol. 13vb\n[1988b: 448]).\n\nIn the context of (T), Heytesbury discusses the casus where\nan agent sees a person who looks exactly like a king, but is not one.\nThe agent can believe the man to be a king beyond any doubt and even\nbelieve himself to know that. But, by (T), he knows neither that the\nman is a king (because that is not true), nor that the man is not a\nking (because he does not believe that) ([RSS] 1494: fol. 13vb [1988b:\n447]). Even though Heytesbury does not explicitly say so, it seems\nnatural to assume that this agent does not know that he failed to know\nthat man is a king. Hence, he fails to know something, but also,\npresumably, fails to know that he fails to know it, which is a\ncounterexample to negative introspection. Accepting the positive\nintrospection while denying the negative introspection is based on\nHeytesbury\u2019s interpretation of knowledge as an evidence-based\nact of considering something and apprehending its factuality: the\nabsence of knowledge alone does not constitute conscious\nignorance. Heytesbury\u2019s account of the closure properties of\nknowledge encompasses the closure of meaning under entailment, the\ndistribution of knowledge over implication, and the distribution of\nknowledge over signification.\n\n\nFirst, Heytesbury introduces the concept of implied meaning\n(significare ex consequenti) and believes that sentential\nmeaning is closed under entailment. As he explains the different\nsenses of \u201csignifying precisely\u201d (significare\nprecise), he claims that a sentence cannot signify something\nprecisely in the sense of not signifying anything else. Instead,\n\u201cto signify precisely\u201d means that a sentence has a\n\u201cprimary meaning\u201d (\u201csignificat primo et\nprincipaliter\u201d or \u201csignificatio primaria et\nadequata\u201d) plus whatever its primary meaning entails\n(quod sequitur ipsam significantem quod ita sit), but nothing\nelse ([RSS] 1494: fol. 15ra\u2013rb [1988b:\n 459\u2013460]).[31]\n To allow that, Heytesbury\u2019s semantics must validate some\nversion of the Bradwardinian sentential\n semantics.[32]\n\nSecond, in the possibly inauthentic [CO], outright logical\nomniscience, i.e., the closure of knowledge under implication, is\ndenied:\n\n(O)\nIf X implies Y and \u03be knows that X,\nthen \u03be knows that Y,\n\n\nbut the distribution of knowledge over implication, i.e., that\nknowledge is closed under known inferences (the \u201caxiom\nK\u201d), is accepted:\n\n(K)\nIf \u03be knows that X implies Y, and \u03be knows\nthat X, then \u03be knows that\n Y.[33]\n\n\nThird, if an agent knows that it is completely the case as a sentence\nsignifies, does he know that everything it signifies is the\n case?[34]\n The problem of conceding a sentence whose meaning is deductively\nclosed by an agent with a finite cognitive capacity is solved by\nintroducing a distinction parallel to (K) and (O) ([RSS] 1494: fol.\n15rb [1988b: 460]); Heytesbury denies:\n\n(SO)\nIf \u03be knows that however x signifies is the case, and\nx signifies that X, then \u03be knows that\nX,\n\n\nbut holds:\n\n(SK)\nIf \u03be knows that however x signifies is the case, and \u03be knows\nthat x signifies that X, then \u03be knows that\nX.\n\n\nTogether with \u201cstrong\u201d semantic closure,\nHeytesbury\u2019s analysis of epistemic operators validates the\nweaker distribution principles and rejects the stronger closure\nprinciples, i.e., different forms of logical\n omniscience.[35]\n2.5. Insolubilia\n\nHeytesbury analyzes insolubilia or self-referential paradoxes\nmost thoroughly in the first chapter of\n [RSS],[36]\n where he dismisses three alternative solutions to paradoxes to settle\nfor the fourth. The first three positions agree that paradoxical\nsentences can have precisely their standard meaning. According to the\nfirst position held by Roger Swyneshed, paradoxical sentences are\nfalse because they imply their own falsity, and a sentence and its\nnegation can be false at the same time if one of them is paradoxical\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 4va and 6rb [1979: 18\u201319 and 45]). According\nto the second position, paradoxical sentences do not make genuine\nstatements, hence are neither true nor false ([RSS] 1494: fols.\n4va\u2013vb [1979: 19]). That is reminiscent of the so-called\n\u201ccassantes\u201d who claim that paradoxical sentences\nfail to make a true or false statement (literally \u201csay\nnothing\u201d) (de Rijk 1966), available, for instance, through\nBurley or Bradwardine (Roure 1970; Bradwardine B-I). Heytesbury also\ncould have viewed the second position as the interpretation of\nBradwardine\u2019s \u201cmediantes\u201d, who claims that\nparadoxical sentences are neither true nor false, but of a\n\u201cmiddle\n value\u201d.[37]\n According to the third position, paradoxical sentences are\neither-true-or-false but neither true nor false; they make genuine\nstatements, but fail to have a standard truth-value ([RSS] 1494: fol.\n4vb [1979: 19\u201320]).\n\nAccording to the fourth position, paradoxical sentences have their\nstandard meaning, but say more than what their overt meanings\nindicate. It is based on the definitions of a paradoxical\ncasus and a paradoxical sentence. There are two versions of\nthese definitions, differing in the last clause:\n\n\nA paradoxical casus is one in which mention is made of some\nsentence such that if in the same casus that sentence\nsignifies precisely as its words commonly pretend, from its being true\nfollows that it is false, and vice versa. ([RSS] 1494: fol. 6rb [1979:\n47])\n\n\nor:\n\n\n\u2026it follows that it is true and also false. (Pozzi 1987:\n236)\n\n\nFurthermore:\n\n\nA paradoxical sentence is one of which mention is made in a\nparadoxical casus, such that if in the same casus it\nsignifies precisely as its words commonly pretend, then from its being\ntrue follows that it is false, and vice versa. ([RSS] 1494: fol. 6rb\n[1979: 47])\n\n\nor:\n\n\n\u2026it follows that it is true and also false. (Pozzi 1987:\n 236)[38]\n\n\nThe solution to paradoxes is exemplified by the casus, where\nSocrates only pronounces the sentence \u201cSocrates is saying\nsomething false\u201d, henceforth labelled (s). Five elementary\nsettings differ in assumptions concerning its meaning:\n\n(1) the meaning of (s) is not posited\n(2) the meaning of (s) is posited, such that:\n\n\n(2.1) (s) has precisely its standard meaning\n(2.2) (s) has its standard meaning, but not precisely its standard\nmeaning, and the additional meaning is not certified\n(2.3) (s) has its standard meaning and its additional meaning is\ncertified, such that:\n\n\n(2.31) (s) has a logical form of a conjunction\n(2.32) (s) has a logical form of a disjunction\n \n \n\n\nFor Heytesbury, \u201cto solve a paradox\u201d is to instruct the\nrespondent in the corresponding obligatio-game. His\ninstructions are as follows:\n\n(R1)\nIf someone constructs a paradoxical casus, either he\nposits how that paradoxical sentence should signify or not. If not,\nthen: when the paradoxical sentence is proposed, one should respond to\nit exactly as one would respond when the casus is not\nassumed. ([RSS] 1494: fol. 6va [1979: 47])\n\n\nThe corresponding moves are:\n\n\nGame 3.\n\n\nOpponent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nRespondent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nJustification \n\n[O1] POSITIO: Socrates only pronounces\n(s).\n[R1] I admit the casus.\nThe casus is possible. \n\n[O2] PROPONITUR: (s) is false.\n[R2] ???\nIrrelevant and ???  \n\n\n\nHeytesbury applies his view of obligationes: in the absence\nof any other assumptions, (s) is initially irrelevant. As such, if\nproposed as the first sentence in the game, the respondent\u2019s\nmove cannot be affected by either the casus or the previous\nmoves, but must follow the respondent\u2019s knowledge about the\nexternal world. Heytesbury\u2019s emphasis on the stage of the game\nsuggests that this can change due to the dynamic character of\nobligationes.\n\n(R2.1)\nIf a paradoxical casus is posited and together with that\nit is assumed that the paradoxical sentence precisely signifies as its\nterms commonly pretend, the casus may in no way be admitted.\n([RSS] 1494: fol. 6va [1979: 48])\n\n\nThe corresponding moves are:\n\n\nGame 4.\n\n\nOpponent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nRespondent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nJustification \n\n[O1] POSITIO: Socrates only pronounces (s) and\n(s) signifies precisely that (s) is false\n[R1] I do not admit the casus.\nThe casus is inconsistent.  \n\n\n\nSince obligationes are consistency-maintenance games, the\nonly non-losing strategy for a respondent is not to start such a game,\nfor otherwise he would be dragged into inconsistency via the\nwell-known paradoxical reasoning.\n\n(R2.2)\nIf someone constructs a paradoxical casus and if it is\nalso assumed that the paradoxical sentence signifies as its terms\npretend (but not precisely so), then when this casus is\nadmitted, the insoluble sentence has to be conceded as implied at\nwhatever stage of the game it is proposed, but that it is true has to\nbe denied as incompatible. ([RSS] 1494: fol. 6va [1979: 49])\n\n\nThe corresponding moves are:\n\n\nGame 5.\n\n\nOpponent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nRespondent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nJustification \n\n[O1] POSITIO: Socrates only pronounces (s) and\n(s) signifies that (s) is false\n[R1] I admit the casus.\nThe casus is consistent. \n\n[O2] PROPONITUR: (s) is false.\n[R2] I concede that.\nImplied by the casus. \n\n[O3] PROPONITUR: \u201c(s) is false\u201d is\ntrue.\n[R3] I deny that.\nIncompatible with the casus.  \n\n\n\nThe justification of [R2] is not clearly explained in [RSS]. A\nminimalist interpretation is that the proposed sentence is implied by\n[R1] via reductio: If (s) is false, then it is false\n(trivially); if (s) is not false, it is true, and then it is the case\nas it signifies, hence it is false. Either way, it is false, hence it\nis\n false.[39]\n An obligational explanation is that (s) is regarded as relevant in\nthis casus, and as such can only be conceded or denied. Since\nits denial implies an inconsistency, such a move must be avoided in a\nconsistency-maintenance game; therefore it should be conceded. Since\nthe casus has been admitted as consistent, it cannot validate\nan inconsistent move; hence, it must validate its opposite. By the\nsame reasoning, it is possible to deny that (s) is true. Furthermore,\nHeytesbury refuses to certify the additional meaning of (s) ([RSS]\n1494: fol. 6va [1979: 49\u201350]). Unsatisfactory as this may seem,\nit is legitimate from the point of view of obligationes:\nmeaning certification is not a move available to the respondent, and\nsince the instructions are respondent-oriented, the actual meaning of\n(s) is an external problem.\n\n(2.31) and (2.32) are dealt with along the same lines.\n\nFor Heytesbury, paradoxes are obligational games with self-referential\n sentences.[40]\n However, his criticism of alternative solutions is part of the\nfourteenth-century developments relating paradoxes to general\nlogico-semantical\n issues.[41]\n He views his approach as relatively defensible and probable, but\nadmits that he cannot solve all objections and considers a completely\nsatisfactory solution to paradoxes impossible (unfortunately without a\njustification). Without too much self-confidence, he closes his\ntreatise by saying that young students should move past the topic and\ndo something useful. ([RSS] 1494: fol. 4vb and 7rb [1979: 21 and\n58])\n3. Speculative Physics\n\nHeytesbury\u2019s RSS may be taken as representative of Oxford\nCalculators\u2019 speculative/mathematical physics. It links\ninterests in logic, mathematics, and physics. As Curtis Wilson says:\n\u201cHeytesbury employs the concept of \u201climit\u201d and\n\u201cinfinite aggregate\u201d with considerable precision and\nsubtlety; and in treating of variable physics quantities, he\napproaches the ideal of a purely mathematical description\u201d\n(Wilson 1960: 3). Not only does Heytesbury analyze physical and\nmathematical problems by means of the techniques of the logica\nmoderna, but he also employs physical and mathematical rules in\nthe analyses of logical or semantic problems of denomination.\nHeytesbury is mostly interested in the problem of determining under\nwhat conditions a subject can be denominated such-and-such, e.g.,\n\u201cwhite\u201d or \u201crunning\u201d. The issue of\ndenomination arises because the attributes of subjects vary in degrees\nof intensity or completeness. He establishes sets of rules of everyday\nspeech, determining how we denominate a subject under all imaginable\ncircumstances of change. For example, in the sophism Omnis homo\nqui est albus currit, he concludes that a man is called to be\n\u201cwhite\u201d if and only if the external surface of the upper\nhalf of him is white (in everyday speech, a man is white if the skin\non his face is white) (Wilson 1960: 22\u201323).\n\nLike one of the founders of the School of Oxford\nCalculators\u2014Richard Kilvington\u2013 Heytesbury takes\nOckham\u2019s nominalist position and affirms that the real physical\nworld consists only of res absolutae, i.e., substances and\nqualities. They both acknowledge that terms such as\n\u201cpoint\u201d, \u201cline\u201d, \u201clatitude\u201d, and\n\u201cdegree\u201d do not have any representation in reality, but\nare useful for describing different types of change. They also hold\nthat time is not real since time is not distinguished\nrealiter from the motion of celestial spheres, and motion is\nnot distinguished realiter from the body which moves. Thus,\nthey both contrast things that are really distinct with things\ndistinguishable only in reason, i.e., in the imagination. Heytesbury\nfollows Kilvington\u2019s frequent use of the phrase secundum\nimaginationem to describe hypothetical situations in which the\nelements of the description, and not the situation itself, are of\nprimary concern. The only requirement for an imaginable case is that\nit should not involve a formal logical contradiction; whether it is\nphysically possible or not is a matter of indifference. As Wilson\nsays,\n\n\na distinction is drawn between realiter or\nnaturaliter or physice loquendo and logice\nor sophistice loquendo: physice we follow experience\nand the principles laid down in the natural philosophy of Aristotle;\nlogice or sophistice we are free to introduce\nwhatever distinctions and cases are convenient and imaginable. (Wilson\n1960: 25)\n\n\nHeytesbury, however, remains in the framework of Aristotelian\nphilosophy of nature, and the problems he discusses are to be found in\nAristotle\u2019s Physica and De caelo.\nNevertheless, Heytesbury is captivated by the mathematical approach es\nthe earlier Oxford Calculators. Like Thomas Bradwardine and Richard\nKilvington, he examines physical problems using mathematical\napparatus. In Chapters 4\u20136 of the Regulae, Heytesbury\ndevelops measurement by limit, i.e., by the first and last instants of\nbeginning and ending, and by the intrinsic and extrinsic limits of\npassive and active capacities. Although these types of\n\u201cmeasuring\u201d do not appear to be straightforwardly\nmathematical, they provide the basis for mathematical considerations\nand give excellent results in analyses of the instantaneous motion, as\nwell as continua. As Wilson states:\n\n\nHeytesbury admits \u201caccording to the common mode of speech\u201d\nthat everything which is, whether time or motion or instant, is in an\ninstant, in the sense that it is instantaneously measured by an\ninstant [\u2026] the instant in time and the instantaneous position\nin movement are always to be regarded as \u201climits\u201d. (Wilson\n1960: 41)\n\n\nThe second type of measurement employs a new calculus of compounding\nratios. The third type of measurement, by latitude of forms, describes\nmotion, in which an accidental form, such as speed, is intensified or\ndiminished. Heytesbury focuses on establishing the rules for the\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d of speed in every type of the continuous\nchanges enumerated by Aristotle, i.e., in local motion, in\naugmentation, and in alteration.\n3.1 Beginning and Ceasing\n\nIn chapter IV of the Regulae (De incipit et desinit)\nHeytesbury poses and analyzes in great detail cases in which any\nprocess, thing, or state may be said to begin or cease to be. He\nbegins with possible expositions of the terms \u201cbeginning\u201d\n(incipere) and \u201cceasing\u201d (desinere) in a\nway that uncovers certain paradoxical properties of the temporal\ncontinuum. \u201cBeginning\u201d may be expounded by\npositio of the present (i.e., by the positing of existence in\nthe present instant) and remotio of the past (i.e., by denial\nof existence in the past), meaning that in the present instant a thing\nor a process is, and immediately prior to the present instant it was\nnot. \u201cBeginning\u201d may be also expounded by remotio\nof the present and positio of the future, meaning that in the\npresent instant a thing or a process is not, and immediately after the\npresent instant it will be. Likewise, \u201cceasing\u201d may be\nexpounded in two ways, either by remotio of the present and\npositio of the past, meaning that in the present instant a\nthing or a process is not, and immediately prior to the present\ninstant it was, or by positio of the present and\nremotio of the future, meaning that in the present instant a\nthing or a process is, and immediately after the present instant it\nwill not be. Heytesbury offers a number of sophisms involving the\nlimit-decision. One of them is particularly interesting since it\nclearly exhibits Heytesbury\u2019s remarkable skill in solving\nproblems of instantaneous motion and time without the symbolic\ntechniques of calculus. Heytesbury poses a case in which both Plato\nand Socrates begin to move from rest at the same instant, but Plato\nstarts to move with a constant acceleration and Socrates with an\nacceleration which starts at zero degree and increases uniformly with\ntime. He concludes that \u201cboth Socrates and Plato infinitely\nslowly begin to be moved, and yet Socrates infinitely more slowly\nbegins to be moved than Plato\u201d (Wilson 1960: 54, [RSS] 1494:\nfol. 26vb). As Wilson proves, the conclusion is an effect of\ncomparison of two infinitesimals of different order.\n\n\nIn the case under consideration both the velocity of Plato (\\(v_p\\))\nand the velocity of Socrates (\\(v_s\\)) are infinitesimal for time\nt approaching zero. Two infinitesimals are said to be of\ndifferent order if the limit of their quotient is either zero or\ninfinite. In the case under consideration the limit of the quotient\n\\(v_p/v_s\\) as \\(t\\rightarrow 0\\) is infinite. (Wilson 1960: 55)\n\n3.2 Maxima and Minima\n\nIn chapter V of the Regulae, Heytesbury considers the limits\nof capacities, and he applies the limit-concept to the bounding of the\nranges of variables and aggregates. All capacities are sorted as\nactive or passive. An active capacity (force) is measured against the\npassive capacity (resistance) which it can overcome. If an active\ncapacity can overcome some resistance, it can overcome less. For\nexample, if Socrates can lift one hundred pounds, he can lift fifty\npounds. Conversely, if a passive capacity can be affected by less, it\ncan be affected by greater. For example, if Socrates can see a grain\nof millet from the distance of a mile, he will be able to see the\nChurch at the same distance. The boundaries of capacities are of two\nkinds: an intrinsic boundary (when an element is a member of the\nsequence of elements it bounds: maximum quod sic, minimum quod\nsic) and an extrinsic boundary (when an element which serves as a\nboundary stands outside the range of elements which it bounds:\nmaximum quod non, minimum quod non). From the definitions of\nactive and passive capacities, it follows that the boundary of an\nactive capacity must be assigned either by the affirmation of the\nmaximum (maximum quod sic) or by the negation of the minimum\n(minimum quod non); the boundary of a passive capacity is\nassigned either by the affirmation of the minimum (minimum quod\nsic) or by the negation of the maximum (maximum quod\nnon).\n\nHeytesbury sets the following conditions which must be obtained for\nlimits to exist: (1) there must be a range in which the capacity can\nact or be acted upon, and another range in which it cannot act or be\nacted upon, and not both; (2) each capacity should only be able to\ntake a value in the range on which it is measured from zero and the\nvalue which serves as its boundary. Thus, if an active capacity is\ncapable of acting upon a given passive capacity in the range, it must\nbe capable of acting upon any less, and if it is not capable of acting\nupon a given passive capacity, it is not capable of acting upon any\ngreater. Conversely, if a passive capacity is capable of being acted\nupon by a certain agent, it must be capable of being acted upon by any\nagent of greater strength, and if it is not capable of being acted\nupon by a certain agent, it is not capable of being acted upon by a\nweaker agent; and (3) infinite capacities like the infinite power of\nGod are excluded from the discussion, since no termination can be\nassigned for them ([RSS] 1494: fol. 29va\u2013vb).\n\nHeytesbury, like Kilvington, classifies all capacities as mutable or\nimmutable. A mutable capacity is capable of more and less, and both\naffirmative and negative parts of the division might be assigned. For\nexample, with respect to Socrates, a mutable power of lifting (an\nactive capacity) a minimum quod non is assigned. For a\npassive capacity the maximum quod non is assigned, e.g., a\nmaximum visible body which cannot be seen at a given distance. An\nimmutable capacity acts in a determinate way, so it produces only the\none effect it actually produces. Therefore, the affirmative part of\nthe division is always assigned as a boundary for immutable capacity.\nThus, e.g., there is a maximum distance which, ceteris\nparibus, Socrates can traverse in an hour by a speed which\nincreases uniformly from A to B degree ([RSS] 1494: fol. 29vb; Wilson\n1960: 73).\n3.3 Three Categories of Change\n\nChapter VI (De tribus praedicamentis) of the Regulae\ndeals with motion in three categories: place, quantity, and quality.\nThe first part (de motu locali) deals with the speed or\nslowness of uniformly or difformly accelerated and decelerated motion\nconsidered in its kinematical aspect. The second part (de\nvelocitate motus augmentationis) deals with augmentation\nunderstood as pure increase in size, and more specifically with the\nspeed of rarefaction as measured by the effect produced, i.e., by\nspace traversed in time. The third part (de velocitate motus\nalterationis) is concentrated on mathematical description of\nvariation of intensity in space and time. The prime purpose to be\nachieved in this chapter is to establish definitions of speed in the\nthree categories of motion. All debated cases are posed secundum\nimaginationem.\n3.3.1 Local Motion\n\nAccording to Heytesbury\u2019s own words: \u201clocal motion by\nnature precedes other kinds [of change] just as the first\u201d\n(De motu locali [DML] 2020: \u00a7 2, 270). He focuses on the\npossible measure of the speed of these changes by the effect produced\n(i.e., the space traversed) during an equal length of time.\nConsequently, he is interested in the kinematic aspect of motion (DML\n2020: \u00a7 63,\n 296).[42]\n Local motions are grouped into two classes: uniform and difform. A\nuniform motion is motion in which equal spaces are traversed\ncontinually in equal parts of time . Difform motions can vary in\ninfinite ways, both with respect to the magnitude or the subject\nmoved, and with respect to time (DML 2020: \u00a7\u00a7 3\u20135,\n270). Difform motion with respect to the subject moved is motion in\nwhich different points of the body move with unequal speeds; for\ninstance, a rolling wheel moves with difform motion since different\npoints on the wheel vary in regard to distance from the axis of\nrotation (DML 2020: \u00a7\u00a7 9\u201316, 271\u2013273). Difform\nmotion with respect to time is motion in which unequal spaces are\ntraversed in equal times. Motion can also be difform with respect to\nboth time and the subject moved (DML 2020: \u00a7\u00a7 17\u201320,\n273\u2013274). Difform motions are subdivided into two classes: the\nuniformly difform (uniformiter difformis) motion and the\ndifformly difform (difformiter difformis) motion (DML 2020:\n\u00a7 21, 275). Uniformly difform motion is motion in which the speed\neither increases or decreases uniformly, that is, a motion in which in\nany equal parts of time, equal latitudes of speed are either acquired\nor lost (DML 2020: \u00a7 22, 275). A difformly difform motion is\nmotion in which a greater latitude of velocity is gained or lost in\none part of time than in another equal to it (DML 2020: \u00a7 40,\n284).\n\nThe most gripping example of uniformly difform motion is accelerated\nmotion, like a motion of a body moving towards the Earth. Heytesbury\ngives a general rule, called the Middle Degree Theorem, by which we\nmay calculate the distance traversed from the latitude of speed\nuniformly acquired. He makes use of this theorem with respect to both\naccelerated and decelerated motions. In his own formulation it reads\nas follows:\n\n\nCertainly, every latitude [of speed] that is acquired or lost\nuniformly, whether commencing at a non-degree or at any degree, as\nlong as it is limited to some finite degree, corresponds precisely to\nits own middle degree in such a way that a moving body that uniformly\nacquires or loses its speed in any given time traverses the distance\nperfectly equal to the one it would traverse during the same time when\nmoving with [a speed corresponding to] this middle\n degree.[43]\n (DML 2020: \u00a7 26, 276; see also Wilson 1960: 122\u201323)\n\n\nAccording to this rule, the distance traversed by a uniformly\naccelerated body in a given time is equal to the distance which would\nbe traversed in the same time in a uniform motion with its middle\ndegree of speed (half of the sum of the initial and final speed). A\nnumber of conclusions follow from this theorem:\n\nSince the medium degree of\u00a0uniformly acquired latitude of\nspeed\u00a0[in uniformly difform motion] which commences at no-degree\nand ends at some finite degree is precisely half the degree of that\nterminating the motion, it follows that a body which moves with a\nuniformly difform motion commencing at no-degree and terminating at\nsome finite degree [of speed] traverses less than half [the distance]\nwhich would be traversed by a body moving uniformly during the same\ntime with a speed equal to a given degree terminating the\n motion.[44]\n (DML 2020: \u00a7 27, 272; see also Wilson 1960: 123)\n[Given that] the medium degree of uniformly difform latitude of\nspeed which commences at some degree and ends at another is greater\nthan half the degree terminating the latitude of its more intense\nextreme, it follows that a body which moves with uniformly difform\nmotion commencing at some degree of speed and terminating at another\ntraverses more than half the distance which would be traversed by a\nbody moving uniformly during the same time with a speed equal to the\nmost intense speed in the uniformly difform\n motion.[45]\n (DML 2020: \u00a7 28, 272; see also Wilson 1960: 123)\nIn a uniformly difform motion commencing with no-degree speed and\nending with some finite degree, the distance traversed in the first\nhalf of the time is one third of that traversed in the second half.\nAnd conversely, in a motion in which the speed decreases uniformly\nfrom some degree to no-degree the distance traversed in the first half\nof the time is three times that traversed in the second\n half.[46]\n (DML 2020: \u00a7 35, 276; see Wilson 1960: 124).\n\n\nBy the end of the chapter, Heytesbury states that an infinite number\nof sophisms can be made concerning speed in local motion, as well as\nthe intension and remission of such speed (DML 2020: \u00a7 61,\n 294).[47]\n3.3.2 Alteration\n\nIn the subsequent chapter dealing with qualitative changes, Heytesbury\nexpresses the same concerns. He takes part in the debate over one of\nthe most widely discussed problems in the fourteenth-century\nphilosophy of nature focused on the possible \u201cmeasure\u201d of\nthe intension and remission of forms. Like most of the Oxford\nCalculators, Heytesbury accepts Scotus\u2019s and Ockham\u2019s\naddition theory and assumes that the intension of form is the result\nof adding qualitative parts. As an Ockhamist, Heytesbury emphasizes\nthat the term \u201cmotion\u201d in alteration connotes nothing else\nthan the degrees or latitude of quality that are successively\nacquired. A basic assumption is that qualitative intensity is a\ncertain kind of linearly ordered and additive quantity. Thus, as in\nthe case of local motion, Heytesbury divides the latitudes of motion\nof alteration into the latitude of motion of intension and the\nlatitude of motion of remission; and the latitude of the latitude of\nmotion into the latitude of the acquisition of the latitude of motion\nand the latitude of the loss of latitude of motion. In modern\nterminology, these latitudes correspond to latitudes of speed and of\nacceleration and deceleration, respectively. Since there is no limit\nto speeds of alteration nor to rates of acceleration or deceleration\nof that speed, those latitudes are all infinite.\n\nHeytesbury presents three different ways of \u201cmeasuring\u201d\nthe speed of alteration in which the intensity of a quality varies\nform one point to another, or from instant to instant of time, or from\npoint to point of the moving body: (1) by the degree (gradus)\ninduced (a subject is considered to be altered faster when a higher\ndegree is induced); (2) by the latitude of form acquired in comparison\nto the size of the subject (the speed of alteration is proportionally\ngreater in a larger body); and (3) by the latitude acquired in a given\ntime, regardless of the size of the subject undergoing alteration.\nHeytesbury holds the third position and claims that as in the case of\nlocal motion, the speed of alteration is to be measured at the point\nof the body where the rate of change is most rapid, that is, where the\nmaximum latitude of form is acquired ([RSS] 1494: fol. 51ra).\n3.3.3 Augmentation\n\nHeytesbury deals with augmentation as with pure increase in size,\nwhich is the same process as rarefaction; more precisely, he deals\nwith the speed of rarefaction as measured by the effect produced.\nThere are three ways of \u201cmeasuring\u201d the speed of\naugmentation acquired in time: (1) by the maximum quantity acquired;\n(2) by the latitude of rarity or rareness; and (3) by the ratio of new\nsize to previous size ([RSS] 1494: fol. 60rb). He holds the third\nposition, according to which the ratios correspond to different\ndegrees of augmentation. Augmentation, like the two other motions, can\nbe uniform or difform. An augmentation is uniform if in equal\nintervals of time, the body undergoing augmentation increases in size\nby the same ratio. While discussing the above mentioned positions,\nHeytesbury makes broad use of the new calculus of ratios invented by\nKilvington and Bradwardine.\n4. Influence\n\nAs a logician, Heytesbury strongly influenced logic in fourteenth and\nfifteenth-century Britain, and there is a notable fifteenth and early\nsixteenth-century reception in Italy where multiple editions of his\ncommentaries on [RSS] and [SCD] were printed (Ashworth & Spade\n1992; de Rijk 1975, 1977). Despite his dismissive attitude toward this\ngenre, Heytesbury\u2019s treatise is one of the most influential late\nmedieval texts. These influences include the British logical tradition\n(see Pironet 2008), the Italian logical\n tradition,[48]\n and John Mair\u2019s\n circle,[49]\n and the treatise is referred to even as late as 1688 (De Benedictis\n1688: 580\u2013590; for other influence, see Spade 1989: 273).\nHeytesbury\u2019s catalogue of solutions to the paradoxes, where the\npositions are (correctly or not) attributed to fourteenth-century\nBritish logicians, is further developed and sometimes defended against\nHeytesbury\u2019s harsh and sarcastic dismissal. (R2.2) is developed\nby extending the proof and supplemented by saying that paradoxical\nsentences (or all sentences, for that matter) signify their own truth.\nFurthermore, Heytesbury\u2019s contribution to epistemic logic in the\nsecond chapter of [RSS] appears to have sparked further debate in the\nupcoming centuries, as documented by the fourteenth and\nfifteenth-century development of the British and Italian treatises\nde scire et dubitare which typically revolved around the\nsophisms formulated by Heytesbury and where Heytesbury\u2019s\nposition was among those which were discussed, sometimes with an\nexplicit attribution to Heytesbury (Boh 1993 and Hanke 2018a and\n2018b). As a philosopher, Heytesbury significantly influenced later\nOxford Calculators: John Dumbleton, anonymous author of the\nTractatus de sex inconvenientibus, Richard Swineshead, author\nof one of the most famous treatises Liber Calculationum, and\ncontinental fourteenth and fifteenth-century philosophers, e.g., John\nCasali, John of Holland, Petrus of Mantua, Cajetan of Thiene, Giovanni\nMarliani, and Paul of Venice (see Wilson 1956: 25\u201328, Rommevaux\n2017: 154\u2013160, Jung, Podko\u0144ski 2020: 130\u201331,\n148\u2013149, 151). The Middle Degree Theorem was widely discussed\nduring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and later played an\nimportant role in the formulation of the law of free fall (see Damerow\net al. 1992: 161\u2013200, esp. 232\u2013236).",
