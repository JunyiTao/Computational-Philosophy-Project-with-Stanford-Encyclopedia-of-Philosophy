The First Meditation and the Possibility of Radical Deception\n\nFor example, in the First Meditation Descartes entertains a number of\npossibilities to the effect that we might be mistaken about results\nthat are perfectly evident to us. One such possibility is that we have\nbeen created by a supremely good God but that, for reasons unbeknownst\nto us, our nature is such that we \u201cgo wrong every time [we] add\ntwo and three or count the sides of a square, or in some even simpler\nmatter\u201d (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14). Another is that we have not been\ncreated by God but have \u201carrived at [our] present state by fate\nor chance or a continuous chain of events\u201d (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14).\nA third is that we are constantly deceived by a malicious demon (AT\n7:22, CSM 2:15). Descartes mentions all of these possibilities to set\nup his Third Meditation point that until we know what made our minds,\nwe are not in a position to trust them and so not in a position to\nknow anything at all (AT 7:36, CSM 2:25). None of these is an actual\npossibility, though Descartes allows that we may not appreciate this\nuntil later:\n\n[Voetius claims that in my philosophy] \u201cGod is thought of as a\ndeceiver.\u201d This is foolish. Although in my First Meditation I\ndid speak of a supremely powerful deceiver, the conception there was\nin no way of the true God, since, as he himself says, it is impossible\nthat the true God should be a deceiver. But if is asked how he knows\nthat this is impossible, he must answer that he knows it from the fact\nthat it implies a contradiction \u2013 that is, it cannot be\nconceived. (\u201cLetter to Voetius,\u201d May 1643, CSMK 222)\n\n\nDescartes allows that if we are careless or not paying attention, we\ncan entertain the supposition that \u201cGod\u201d does not exist or\nis a deceiver, but he holds that upon reflection the supreme being is\na necessary existent, and a necessary existent that cannot deceive\n(The Fifth Meditation, CSM 2:46\u201348). We might have thought\notherwise at the start of inquiry, before we had carefully unpacked\nand examined our concepts \u2013 at a moment when we were not yet\nputting forward a priori non-sensory claims, which are the only sort\nof claim that are suitable as premises in a metaphysical argument. As\noften happens in philosophy, we come to recognize that there are\nthings that seem clear to us before we think them through, and we\nrecognize that the reason why they seemed clear was that we\nhadn\u2019t thought them through yet. As Descartes himself\nwrites,\n\nIn order to philosophize seriously and search out the truth about the\nthings that are capable of being known, we must first of all lay aside\nall our preconceived opinions, or at least we must take the greatest\ncare not to put our trust in any of the opinions accepted by us in the\npast until we have first scrutinized them afresh and confirmed their\ntruth. Next, we must give our attention in an orderly way to the\nnotions that we have within us, and we must judge to be true all and\nonly those whose truth we clearly and distinctly recognize when we\nattend to them in this way. \u2026When we contrast all this\nknowledge with the confused thoughts we had before, we will acquire\nthe habit of forming clear and distinct concepts of all the things\nthat can be known. These few instructions seem to me to contain the\nmost important principles of human knowledge. (Principles\nI.75, AT 8A:38\u20139, CSM 1:221)\n\n\nWhen we construct arguments on the basis of basic a priori principles\nof metaphysics \u2013 what Descartes calls \u201cprimary\nnotions\u201d (Second Replies, AT 7:145\u201346, CSM 2:104;\nPrinciples I.50, AT 8A:23\u201324, CSM 1:209) \u2013 and\nnot the non a priori premises that constitute much of the early\nthinking of Descartes\u2019 meditator, we recognize that God is a\nnecessary existent who cannot deceive and also that He is the\nindependent and supreme creator of all reality, both possible and\nactual (\u201cTo [Mesland], 2 May 1644,\u201d AT 4:118\u201319,\nCSMK 235; \u201cTo [Mersenne], 27 May 1630,\u201d AT 1:152, CSMK 25;\nThird Meditation, AT 7:45, CSM 2:31). If so, we know on a priori\ngrounds that the possibilities introduced in the First Meditation are\nfictional and indeed are not possibilities at all. It turns out, upon\nreflection, that God did not create them. This is not just to say that\nthe possibilities exist but do not obtain. To say that a possibility\nexists but does not obtain would be to say that it exists as a\npossibility that is not actualized; it would be to say that in\naddition to actual reality there also exists possible reality and that\nsome possible reality is never actualized. If in Descartes\u2019s\nsystem God created only actual reality and not in addition any\npossible reality, then possibilities themselves are not real \u2013\nthey have no ontological status and so are not in fact possibilities,\nbecause they are not anything. According to Descartes, God did not\ncreate the possibility that we exist with minds that might be certain\nof things that are false; He did not create the possibility that we\nevolved from chance; He did not create the possibility of an evil\ndemon. None of these possibilities exists unless they are created, and\nthey do not exist just because the cognitive deliverances of the First\nMeditation meditator tell us that they do. When we (or the meditator)\npostulated their existence in the First Meditation, we were being\nhasty, and all that we had to go on at that early stage of inquiry was\nour confused pre-Meditations conceptions.\n\nWe might wonder though if Descartes would be happy to identify the\npossibilities of the First Meditation as epistemic\npossibilities, even if they are not real possibilities. After all, the\nmeditator is entertaining doubts in the First Meditation, and she is\nhonestly reporting that because she is not yet certain that God exists\nor is not a deceiver, for all she knows God might not exist exist or\nmight be a deceiver. She concludes that it is possible that God does\nnot exist and that it is possible that He is a deceiver, and indeed\nboth of those claims, in the sense in which they are uttered, would\nappear to be true at the moment that she utters them. It certainly\nseems as though the meditator is saying something true when she\nexpresses that for all she knows God is a deceiver (or does not\nexist), but a complication arises when we consider Descartes\u2019\nown view that a mind is not really thinking of God if they are\nimagining an extremely powerful being that is a deceiver\n(\u201cLetter to Voetius,\u201d May 1643, CSMK 222, cited above).\nNor are we thinking of God if we have an imagistic idea of a giant man\non a cloud (Fifth Replies, CSM 2:252), and we are not\nthinking of mind or self if we have an imagistic idea of air or fire\n(Fifth Replies, CSM 2:264). Regardless of how we might report\nor describe our own thinking in such cases, those just are not the\nthings that we have in mind. If so, a question arises about whether or\nnot Descartes would want to allow that the First Meditation\npossibility that (for example) God is a deceiver is in fact the\nepistemic possibility that (for all the First Meditation meditator\nknows) God might be a deceiver. He would be reluctant to allow this, I\nthink, because he is committed to saying that the First Meditation\nmeditator who thinks of God as a deceiver is not thinking of God. If\nthe meditator is just thinking the letters \u2018Deus\u2019 in\nLatin, he is not thinking of God (\u201cTo [Mersenne], 27 May\n1630,\u201d AT 1:150, CSMK 25), or if the meditator is thinking a\nconfused compound idea of God and sensible bodies (Second\nReplies, AT 7:130\u2013131, CSM 2:94), he is thinking of a\nchimera. Descartes will not thumb his nose at pre-Meditations\nthinking if it is a fact on the ground, but that is in part to say\nthat he holds that the possibilities of the First Meditation are\nextremely confused. The pre-Meditations thinking of the\nmeditator is what it is, and Descartes will not pretend that it is not\noperative.\n\nDescartes is very explicit about the importance of employing (what\nsome might regard as a not completely honest) pedagogical method. In\norder to maneuver his readers into a position in which they\nare able to understand his metaphysics, he needs to help them\nto clear up their ideas. If he simply tells us his view, we will hear\nit against the background of confused ideas that (on his view) it is\nimperative we discard. The view that we would walk away with would not\nbe Descartes\u2019 view but something else. Descartes therefore opts\nfor a special strategy for presenting his metaphysics: he puts things\nin terms of the confusions that we understand, otherwise we will not\nunderstand him. If we object (as does Gassendi) to this kind of\nmaneuver, Descartes insists that under the circumstances it is only\nappropriate. He does not see anything objectionable in guiding us to\ntruth by way of conceptions that are false or incoherent. Instead, he\nis providing a service:\n\n[T]ake the case of someone who imagines a deceiving god \u2013 even\nthe true God, but not yet clearly enough known to himself or to the\nothers for whom he frames his hypothesis. Let us suppose that he does\nnot misuse this fiction for the evil purpose of persuading others to\nbelieve something false of the Godhead, but uses it only to enlighten\nthe intellect, and bring greater knowledge of God\u2019s nature to\nhimself and to others. Such a person is in no way sinning in order\nthat good may come. There is no malice at all in his action; he does\nsomething which is good in itself, and no one can rebuke him for it\nexcept slanderously. (\u201cTo Buitendijck 1643,\u201d AT 4:64, CSMK\n230)\n\n\nThe possibilities that Descartes mentions early in the\nMeditations are not a part of his ontology. When he talks\nabout these, he is not interested in truth but, rather, in helping his\nreader to move through and past\n confusion.[7]\n Unless we are going to saddle Descartes with the view that it really\nis possible that our minds are radically defective and that\nnonetheless we ought to go on reasoning anyway, we should\nconclude that Descartes holds that the possibilities of the First\nMeditation have no ontological status and hence that they are nothing\nat all.\n\nBut Descartes did worry that in the wrong hands his references to the\n(incoherent) possibility of radical deception might actually backfire.\nIn a letter to Mersenne, he acknowledges that his 1637 Discourse\non the Method argumentation for the existence of God would have\nbeen more rigorous had he introduced \u201cdoubts and scruples\u201d\nthat \u201cshow\u2026 which judgements depend only on the pure\nunderstanding\u201d (\u201cTo Mersenne, 27 February 1637,\u201d AT\n1:350, CSMK 53). He says that he leaves those out of the\nDiscourse but that he might include them in his\n\u201ctreatise of metaphysics\u201d (ibid.). The doubts\nthat appear in the Meditations but not in the\nDiscourse are the hyperbolic First Meditation arguments to\nthe effect that we might be mistaken about matters that are utterly\nevident to us. Descartes writes that \u201cI left th[ese] out on\npurpose and after deliberation, mainly because I had written in the\nvernacular. I was afraid that weak minds might avidly embrace the\ndoubts and scruples which I would have had to propound, and afterwards\nbe unable to follow as fully the arguments by which I would have\nendeavoured to remove them. Thus I would have set them on a false path\nand been unable to bring them back\u201d (ibid.). That is to\nsay, Descartes omits the hyperbolic doubts from the Discourse\nbecause he is afraid that some minds might take them seriously and\nreason to a point from which there is no return Cunning (2023, chapter\nfour). For example, they might conclude at the end of the First\nMeditation that it is true that it is possible that we are\ndeceived about matters that are utterly evident to us, and we might\nthen assert that all of the reasoning that comes after the First\nMeditation is entirely up for grabs. Of course, as a matter of\nhistorical fact it is not just weak minds that take seriously the\nargumentation of the First Meditation. Descartes seems to be thinking\nthat an educated reader would see the First Meditation for what it is\n\u2013 perhaps a reader who is fluent in Latin and not just the\nFrench vernacular, and who would perhaps be familiar with the methods\nof a geometer like Archimedes. And it is easy to imagine why he would\nthink that. A philosophy instructor will often start a lesson with an\nanalogy that is incoherent but that highlights the intuitive force of\nan opposing view instead: for example we might begin a class in ethics\nby pointing to surveys and case studies that show that the vast\nmajority of Nazi soldiers believed that their treatment of Jewish\nprisoners during WWII was just, and we might ask if the conclusion to\ndraw is that morality is entirely a matter of opinion, or even that\nNazi ideology is to be accepted. Perhaps a student then approaches us\nafter class and says that they would like to become a Nazi. Descartes\nwould be right to say that the student has a weak mind, though we can\nalso understand why in certain instructional circumstances he might\nwant to use a different lesson plan instead. He was mistaken to think\nthat all readers of the Meditations would notice that the\nreasoning of the First Meditation is just meant to help us to see\n\u201cwhich judgements depend only on the pure understanding,\u201d\nfor example the judgments about the nature of wax at the end of the\nSecond Meditation and the primary notions that are central to the\nargumentation for the existence of God in the Third. Those are known\nby \u201can act of purely mental scrutiny\u201d (AT 7:31, CSM 2:21),\nand as such they leave the confused claims of the First Meditation in\nthe dust.\n",
