    "main_text": "Objections || Bias\n3.4 Bias\n\nThe further objection might then be raised that reflective equilibrium\nis vulnerable to arbitrary order or framing biases (McPherson 2015:\n662\u2013663; List & Valentini 2016: 542). One study found that\nprofessional philosophers were vulnerable to order and framing\neffects, and that this was not reduced by reflection or expertise on\nthe topics in question (Schwitzgebel & Cushman 2015). The\njudgments of participants in reflective equilibrium might be\nconsidered unreliable in the sense that they vary with factors that\nthey themselves consider irrelevant (Paulo 2020: 335\u2013336).\n\nAdditional biases are suggested by experiments bringing out the\nemotional nature of moral reasoning. They show, for instance, that\nthere is greater activation of brain areas associated with emotional\nprocessing in personal cases, such as the variant of the trolley\nproblem where a large person is pushed from a footbridge, than in\notherwise similar impersonal cases, such as the original trolley\nproblem (Greene et al. 2001). Peter Singer suggests that considered\njudgments in such cases are emotionally-driven evolved responses to\ncircumstances that no longer obtain:\n\n\nthe salient feature that explains our different intuitive judgments\nconcerning the two cases is that the footbridge case is the kind of\nsituation that was likely to arise during the eons of time over which\nwe were evolving; whereas the standard trolley case describes a way of\nbringing about someone\u2019s death that has only been possible in\nthe past century or two, a time far too short to have any impact on\nour inherited patterns of emotional response. But what is the moral\nsalience of the fact that I have killed someone in a way that was\npossible a million years ago, rather than in a way that became\npossible only two hundred years ago? I would answer: none. (Singer\n2005: 348)\n\n\nHe therefore concludes that reflective equilibrium is mistaken in\ngiving considered judgments a central role in moral theorizing. Other\ncritics similarly suggest that considered judgments may be based on\nprejudice (Brandt 1979: 22; Hare 1981: 12; Anderson 2015).\n\nWide reflective equilibrium may be able to take on board these\nconcerns, and revise judgments accordingly. For instance, if we are\nmoved by Singer\u2019s argument about the strongly emotional and\nevolutionary character of some of our moral judgments, we could use a\nrevised conception of considered judgments that excludes judgments\ndistorted in this way (Tersman 2008: 398). Alternatively, we could\nallow such judgments to enter the process, but revise them given the\nbackground theory that Singer introduces (see Tersman 2008: 397).\nOrder or framing effects would similarly be highlighted by\npsychological background theories, allowing the deliberator to take\ncompensatory measures.\n",
