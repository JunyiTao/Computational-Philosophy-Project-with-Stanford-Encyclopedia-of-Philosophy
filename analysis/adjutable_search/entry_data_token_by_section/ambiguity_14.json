    "main_text": "Detecting Ambiguity || Contradiction Tests\n4.3 Contradiction Tests\n\nAnother way to test for ambiguity is to test for lack of contradiction\nin sentences that look to be contradictory. For example, say someone\nargued that \u2018aunt\u2019 was ambiguous on account of not\nspecifying maternal from paternal aunt. If that was the case, we would\nexpect that we can access the two distinct senses of\n\u2018aunt\u2019 just as we can for \u2018bank\u2019. However,\ncompare:\n\nThat bank isn\u2019t a bank.\n*She is an aunt but she isn\u2019t an aunt.\n\n\nBoth sentences are rather awkward but only one is doomed to\nlife as a contradiction. This is good evidence that \u2018aunt\u2019 is\nunspecified with respect to which side of the family she comes from,\nbut not ambiguous. The tests can be used for most of the other types\nof ambiguity:\n\nMy superfluous hair remover is not a superfluous hair remover; (I\nneed it!)\nThe goose is ready to eat but it\u2019s not ready to eat; (we\nneed to cook it first.)\n\n\n(It helps to provide a paraphrase afterwards to bring out the distinct\nsenses). The tests can be used to detect lexical, structural and\nthematic ambiguity.\n",
