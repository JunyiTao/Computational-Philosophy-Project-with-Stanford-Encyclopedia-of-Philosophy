    "main_text": "The Varieties of Religious Experience\n5. The Varieties of Religious Experience\n\nLike The Principles of Psychology, Varieties is\n\u201cA Study in Human Nature,\u201d as its subtitle says. But at\nsome five hundred pages it is only half the length of The\nPrinciples of Psychology, befitting its more restricted, if still\nlarge, scope. For James studies that part of human nature that is, or\nis related to, religious experience. His interest is not in religious\ninstitutions, ritual, or, even for the most part, religious ideas, but\nin \u201cthe feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in\ntheir solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in\nrelation to whatever they may consider the divine\u201d (V 31).\n\nJames sets out a central distinction of the book in early chapters on\n\u201cThe Religion of Healthy-Mindedness\u201d and \u201cThe Sick\nSoul.\u201d The healthy-minded religious person\u2014Walt Whitman is\none of James\u2019s main examples\u2014has a deep sense of\n\u201cthe goodness of life,\u201d (V 79) and a soul of\n\u201csky-blue tint\u201d (V 80). Healthy-mindedness can be\ninvoluntary, just natural to someone, but often comes in more willful\nforms. Liberal Christianity, for example, represents the triumph of a\nresolute devotion to healthy-mindedness over a morbid \u201cold\nhell-fire theology\u201d (V 91). James also cites the\n\u201cmind-cure movement\u201d of Mary Baker Eddy, for whom\n\u201cevil is simply a lie, and any one who mentions it is a\nliar\u201d (V 107). For \u201cThe Sick Soul,\u201d in contrast,\n\u201cradical evil gets its innings\u201d (V 163). No matter how\nsecure one may feel, the sick soul finds that \u201c[u]nsuspectedly\nfrom the bottom of every fountain of pleasure, as the old poet said,\nsomething bitter rises up: a touch of nausea, a falling dead of the\ndelight, a whiff of melancholy\u2026.\u201d These states are not\nsimply unpleasant sensations, for they bring \u201ca feeling of\ncoming from a deeper region and often have an appalling\nconvincingness\u201d (V 136).  James\u2019s main examples are\nLeo Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cMy Confession,\u201d John Bunyan\u2019s\nautobiography, and a report of terrifying\n\u201cdread\u201d\u2014allegedly from a French correspondent but\nactually from James himself. Some sick souls never get well, while\nothers recover or even triumph: these are the\n\u201ctwice-born.\u201d In chapters on \u201cThe Divided Self, and\nthe Process of Its Unification\u201d and on \u201cConversion,\u201d\nJames discusses St. Augustine, Henry Alline, Bunyan, Tolstoy, and a\nrange of popular evangelists, focusing on what he calls \u201cthe\nstate of assurance\u201d (V 247) they achieve. Central to this state\nis \u201cthe loss of all the worry, the sense that all is ultimately\nwell with one, the peace, the harmony, the willingness to be,\neven though the outer conditions should remain the same\u201d (V\n248).\n\nVarieties\u2019 classic chapter on \u201cMysticism\u201d\noffers \u201cfour marks which, when an experience has them, may\njustify us in calling it mystical\u2026\u201d (V 380). The first is\nineffability: \u201cit defies expression\u2026its quality must be\ndirectly experienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to\nothers.\u201d Second is a \u201cnoetic quality\u201d: mystical\nstates present themselves as states of knowledge. Thirdly, mystical\nstates are transient; and, fourth, subjects are passive with respect\nto them: they cannot control their coming and going. Are these states,\nJames ends the chapter by asking, \u201cwindows through which the\nmind looks out upon a more extensive and inclusive world[?]\u201d (V\n428).\n\nIn chapters entitled \u201cPhilosophy\u201d\u2014devoted in large\npart to pragmatism\u2014and \u201cConclusions,\u201d James finds\nthat religious experience is on the whole useful, even \u201camongst\nthe most important biological functions of mankind,\u201d but he\nconcedes that this does not make it true. Nevertheless, James\narticulates his own belief\u2014which he does not claim to\nprove\u2014that religious experiences connect us with a greater, or\nfurther, reality not accessible in our normal cognitive relations to\nthe world: \u201cThe further limits of our being plunge, it seems to\nme, into an altogether other dimension of existence from the sensible\nand merely \u2018understandable\u2019 world\u201d (V 515).\n",
