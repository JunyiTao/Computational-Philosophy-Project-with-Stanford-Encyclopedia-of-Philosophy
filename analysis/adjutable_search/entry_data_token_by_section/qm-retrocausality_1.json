Metaphysical Preliminaries\n\nBefore addressing two of the main motivations for adopting the\nhypothesis of retrocausality in the foundations of quantum theory, it\nwill be worthwhile to provide a few comments on two key notions that\nplay a significant role in the following discussion: causality and\nlocality. This will help to pin down what exactly is meant, and not\nmeant, by retrocausality.\n",
