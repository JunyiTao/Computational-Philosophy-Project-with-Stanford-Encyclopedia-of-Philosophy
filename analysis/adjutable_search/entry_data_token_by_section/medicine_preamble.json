    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy of medicine is a field that seeks to explore fundamental\nissues in theory, research, and practice within the health sciences,\nparticularly metaphysical and epistemological topics. Its historic\nroots arguably date back to ancient times, to the Hippocratic corpus\namong other sources, and there have been extended scholarly\ndiscussions on key concepts in the philosophy of medicine since at\nleast the 1800s. Debates have occurred in the past over whether there\nis a distinct field rightly termed \u201cphilosophy of\nmedicine\u201d (e.g., Caplan 1992) but as there are now dedicated\njournals and professional organizations, a relatively well-established\ncanon of scholarly literature, and distinctive questions and problems,\nit is defensible to claim that philosophy of medicine has now\nestablished itself. Although ethics and values are part of many\nproblems addressed within the philosophy of medicine, bioethics is\ngenerally considered to be a distinct field, and hence is not explored\nin this entry (but see the entry on \n theory and bioethics).  \nThat being said, philosophy of medicine serves as a foundation for\nmany debates within bioethics, given that it analyzes fundamental\ncomponents of the practice of medicine that frequently arise in\nbioethics such as concepts of disease. The philosophy of medicine also\nhas made important contributions to general philosophy of science, and\nparticularly to understandings of explanation, causation, and\nexperimentation as well as debates over applications of scientific\nknowledge. Finally, the philosophy of medicine has contributed to\ndiscussions on methods and goals within both research and practice in\nthe medical and health sciences. This entry focuses primarily on\nphilosophy of medicine in the Western tradition, although there are\ngrowing literatures on philosophy of non-Western and alternative\nmedical practices. It emphasizes philosophical literature while\nutilizing relevant scholarly publications from other disciplinary\nperspectives.\n",
