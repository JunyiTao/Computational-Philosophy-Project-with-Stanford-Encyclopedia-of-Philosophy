    "main_text": "Central topics in the debate || Divine action and creation\n3.2 Human origins\n\nChristianity, Islam, and Judaism have similar creation stories, which\nultimately go back to the first book of the Hebrew Bible (Genesis).\nAccording to Genesis, humans are the result of a special act of\ncreation. Genesis 1 offers an account of the creation of the world in\nsix days, with the creation of human beings on the sixth day. It\nspecifies that humans were created male and female, and that they were\nmade in God\u2019s image. Genesis 2 provides a different order of\ncreation, where God creates humans earlier in the sequence (before\nother animals), and only initially creates a man, later fashioning a\nwoman out of the man\u2019s rib. Islam has a creation narrative\nsimilar to Genesis 2, with Adam being fashioned out of clay. These\nhandcrafted humans are regarded as the ancestors of all living humans\ntoday. Together with Ussher\u2019s chronology, the received view in\neighteenth-century Europe was that humans were created only about 6000\nyears ago, in an act of special creation.\n\nHumans occupy a privileged position in these creation accounts. In\nChristianity, Judaism, and some strands of Islam, humans are created\nin the image of God (imago Dei). Humans also occupy a special\nplace in creation as a result of the Fall. In Genesis 3, the account\nof the Fall stipulates that the first human couple lived in the Garden\nof Eden in a state of innocence and/or righteousness. This means they\nwere able to not sin, whereas we are no longer able to refrain from\nsinning. By eating from the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Good and\nEvil they fell from this state, and death, manual labor, as well as\npain in childbirth were introduced. Moreover, as a result of this\nso-called \u201coriginal sin\u201d, the effects of Adam\u2019s sin\nare passed on to every human being. The Augustinian interpretation of\noriginal sin also emphasizes that our reasoning capacities have been\nmarred by the distorting effects of sin (the so-called noetic effects\nof sin): as a result of sin, our original perceptual and reasoning\ncapacities have been marred. This interpretation is influential in\ncontemporary analytic philosophy of religion. For example, Plantinga\n(2000) appeals to the noetic effects of sin to explain religious\ndiversity and unbelief, offering this as an explanation for why not\neveryone believes in God even though this belief would be properly\nbasic.\n\nThere are different ways in which Christians have thought about the\nFall and original sin. In Western Christianity, Augustine\u2019s\ndoctrine of original sin is very influential, though there is no\ngenerally accepted Christian doctrine on original sin (Couenhoven\n2005). For Augustine, humans were in a state of original righteousness\nbefore the Fall, and by their action not only marred themselves but\nthe entirety of creation. By contrast, Eastern Orthodox churches are\nmore influenced by Irenaeus, an early Church Father who argued that\nhumans were originally innocent and immature, rather than righteous.\nJohn Hick (1966) was an influential proponent of \u201cIrenaean\nstyle\u201d theodicy in contemporary Christianity. \n\nOver the past decades, authors in the Christian religion and science\nliterature have explored these two interpretations (Irenaean,\nAugustinian) and how they can be made compatible with scientific\nfindings (see De Smedt and De Cruz 2020 for a review). Scientific\nfindings and theories relevant to human origins come from a range of\ndisciplines, in particular geology, paleoanthropology (the study of\nancestral hominins, using fossils and other evidence), archaeology,\nand evolutionary biology. These findings challenge traditional\nreligious accounts of humanity, including the special creation of\nhumans, the imago Dei, the historical Adam and Eve, and\noriginal sin.\n\nIn natural philosophy, the dethroning of humanity from its position as\na specially created species predates Darwin and can already be found\nin early transmutationist publications. For example, Beno\u00eet de\nMaillet\u2019s posthumously published Telliamed (1748, the\ntitle is his name in reverse) traces the origins of humans and other\nterrestrial animals from sea creatures. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed\nchimpanzees as the ancestors to humans in his Philosophie\nZoologique (1809). The Scottish publisher and geologist Robert\nChambers\u2019 anonymously published Vestiges of Creation\n(1844) stirred controversy with its detailed naturalistic account of\nthe origin of species. He proposed that the first organisms arose\nthrough spontaneous generation, and that all subsequent organisms\nevolved from them. Moreover, he argued that humans have a single\nevolutionary origin: \n\n\nThe probability may now be assumed that the human race sprung from one\nstock, which was at first in a state of simplicity, if not barbarism\n(1844: 305) \n\n\na view starkly different from the Augustinian interpretation of\nhumanity as being in a prelapsarian state of perfection.\n\nDarwin was initially reluctant to publish on human origins. While he\ndid not discuss human evolution in his Origin of Species, he\npromised, \u201cLight will be thrown on the origin of man and his\nhistory\u201d (1859: 487). Huxley (1863) wrote Man\u2019s Place\nin Nature, the first book on human evolution from a Darwinian\npoint of view which discussed fossil evidence, such as the then\nrecently uncovered Neanderthal fossils from Gibraltar. Darwin\u2019s\n(1871) Descent of Man identified Africa as the likely place\nwhere humans originated, and used comparative anatomy to demonstrate\nthat chimpanzees and gorillas were closely related to humans. In the\ntwentieth century, paleoanthropologists debated whether humans\nseparated from the other great apes (at the time wrongly classified\ninto the paraphyletic group Pongidae) about 15 million years\nago, or about 5 million years ago. Molecular clocks\u2014first immune\nresponses (e.g., Sarich & Wilson 1967), then direct genetic\nevidence (e.g., Rieux et al. 2014)\u2014favor the shorter\nchronology.\n\nThe discovery of many hominin fossils, including Ardipithecus\nramidus (4.4 million years ago), Australopithecus\nafarensis (nicknamed \u201cLucy\u201d), about 3.5 million years\nold, the Sima de los Huesos hominins (about 400,000 years old,\nancestors to the Neanderthals), Homo neanderthalensis, and\nthe intriguing Homo floresiensis (small hominins who lived on\nthe island of Flores, Indonesia, dated to 700,000\u201350,000 years\nago) have created a rich, complex picture of hominin evolution. These\nfinds are supplemented by detailed analyses of ancient DNA extracted\nfrom fossil remains, bringing to light a previously unknown species of\nhominin (the Denisovans) who lived in Siberia up to about 40,000 years\nago. Taken together, this evidence indicates that humans did not\nevolve in a simple linear fashion, but that human evolution resembles\nan intricate branching tree with many dead ends, in line with the\nevolution of other species. Genetic and fossil evidence favors a\npredominantly African origin of our species Homo sapiens (as\nearly as 315,000 years ago) with limited gene-flow from other hominin\nspecies such as Neanderthals and Denisovans (see, e.g., Richter et al.\n2017).\n\nIn the light of these scientific findings, contemporary science and\nreligion authors have reconsidered the questions of human uniqueness,\nimago Dei, the Incarnation, and the historicity of original\nsin. Some authors have attempted to reinterpret human uniqueness as a\nnumber of species-specific cognitive and behavioral adaptations. For\nexample, van Huyssteen (2006) considers the ability of humans to\nengage in cultural and symbolic behavior, which became prevalent in\nthe Upper Paleolithic, as a key feature of uniquely human behavior.\nOther theologians have opted to broaden the notion of imago\nDei. Given what we know about the capacities for morality and\nreason in non-human animals, Celia Deane-Drummond (2012) and Oliver\nPutz (2009) reject an ontological distinction between humans and\nnon-human animals, and argue for a reconceptualization of the\nimago Dei to include at least some nonhuman animals. Joshua\nMoritz (2011) raises the question of whether extinct hominin species,\nsuch as Homo neanderthalensis and Homo floresiensis,\nwhich co-existed with Homo sapiens for some part of\nprehistory, partook in the divine image.\n\nThere is also discussion of how we can understand the Incarnation (the\nbelief that Jesus, the second person of the Trinity, became a human being)\nwith the evidence we have of human evolution. Some interpret\nChrist\u2019s divine nature quite liberally. For instance, Peacocke\n(1979) regarded Jesus as the point where humanity is perfect for the\nfirst time. Christ is the progression and culmination of what\nevolution has been working toward in the teleological, progressivist\ninterpretation of evolution by Teilhard de Chardin (1971). According\nto Teilhard, evil is still horrible but no longer incomprehensible; it\nbecomes a natural feature of creation\u2014since God chose evolution\nas his mode of creation, evil arises as an inevitable byproduct.\nDeane-Drummond (2009), however, points out that this interpretation is\nproblematic: Teilhard worked within a Spencerian progressivist model\nof evolution, and he was anthropocentric, seeing humanity as the\nculmination of evolution. Contemporary evolutionary theory has\nrepudiated the Spencerian progressivist view, and adheres to a\nstricter Darwinian model. Deane-Drummond, who regards human morality\nas lying on a continuum with the social behavior of other animals,\nconceptualizes the Fall as a mythical, rather than a historical event.\nIt represents humanity\u2019s sharper awareness of moral concerns and\nits ability to make wrong choices. She regards Christ as incarnate\nwisdom, situated in a theodrama that plays against the backdrop of an\nevolving creation. Like all human beings, Christ is connected to the\nrest of creation through common descent. By saving us, he saves the\nwhole of creation.\n\nDebates on the Fall and the historical Adam have centered on how these\nnarratives can be understood in the light of contemporary science. On\nthe face of it, limitations of our cognitive capacities can be\nnaturalistically explained as a result of biological constraints, so\nthere seems little explanatory gain to appeal to the narrative of the\nFall. Some have attempted to interpret the concepts of sin and Fall in\nways that are compatible with paleoanthropology, notably Peter van\nInwagen (2004) and Jamie K. Smith (2017), who have argued that God\ncould have providentially guided hominin evolution until there was a\ntightly-knit community of primates, endowed with reason, language, and\nfree will, and this community was in close union with God. At some\npoint in history, these hominins somehow abused their free will to\ndistance themselves from God. These narratives follow the Augustinian\ntradition. Others, such as John Schneider (2014, 2020), on the other\nhand, argue that there is no genetic or paleoanthropological evidence\nfor such a community of superhuman beings.\n\nThis survey has given a sense of the richness of the literature of\nscience and religion. Giving an exhaustive overview would go beyond\nthe scope of an encyclopedia entry. Because science and religion are\nsuch broad terms, the literature has split up in diverse fields of\n\u201cscience engaged theology\u201d, where a specific claim or\nsubfield in science is studied in relation to a specific claim in\ntheology (Perry & Ritchie 2018). For example, rather than ask if\nChristianity is compatible with science, one could ask whether\nChristian eschatology is compatible with scientific claims about\ncultural evolution, or the cosmic fate of the universe. As the scope\nof science and religion becomes less parochial and more global in its\noutlook, the different topics the field can engage with become very\ndiverse.\n",
