    "main_text": "Indirect, Theoretical Arguments || The Conditional Fallacy\n2.4 The Conditional Fallacy\n\n\n(Nontrivial) Counterfactual Motivation versions of internalism are\nsometimes accused of committing a \u2018conditional\nfallacy\u2019 (named by Shope (1978)). To commit this \u2018fallacy\u2019 is to claim that\nit is necessary for an agent\u2019s having a reason to do A that\nhe would be motivated under certain conditions to do A, when\nthere are some reasons that the agent can have only if precisely those\nconditions do not obtain. For example, some versions of internalism\nappeal to counterfactuals involving full rationality, but sometimes\nagents have certain reasons precisely because they are not fully\nrational. Smith (1994) offers the case, due to Gary Watson, of a\ndefeated squash player who, because he is prone to irrational anger\nthat could cause him to smash his opponent\u2019s face with his racquet,\nhas a reason not to cross the court to shake the winner\u2019s hand. When\nthe conditions specified by the relevant internalist thesis do obtain,\nthe reason is then not present to motivate the agent, falsifying the\ncounterfactual. For example, were Watson\u2019s squash player to be fully\nrational, then it would no longer be true that if he crossed the court\nhe might hit his opponent, and therefore he wouldn\u2019t be motivated\naccordingly not to cross the court. The relevant internalist thesis\nthen yields the false result that the irrational squash player has no\nreason not to cross the court.\n\n\nIn defense of his own internalist thesis, involving counterfactual\nmotivation under the condition of sound deliberation from full\ninformation, Williams (1995) raises an objection of this kind against\nMcDowell\u2019s rival claim involving the condition of full\nvirtue. He observes that being less than fully virtuous\ngives agents reasons to act that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have\nhad and that therefore would not motivate a fully virtuous agent.\nOthers object to Williams\u2019 own counterfactuals involving sound\ndeliberation that there are reasons that agents have precisely because\nthey are not capable of deliberating soundly, which his version of\ninternalism therefore fails to accommodate.\n\n\nIt is plausible that objections of this kind will be effective against\nany nontrivial Counterfactual Motivation version of internalism. This\nproblem has prompted some to switch from a Counterfactual Motivation\nmodel to a Counterfactual State model, and others to be more\ncareful about specifying just what state they have in mind. The idea\nis that an agent S has a reason to do\nA only if, were she in certain counterfactual circumstances,\nshe would desire S in her actual circumstances to\ndo A (Smith 1994). Michael Smith calls this\nthe advice model (in contrast to the example model),\nand it plausibly avoids the problems connected with the\n\u2018conditional fallacy\u2019 because it builds in sensitivity to\nthe relevant conditions in the actual cases that generate the\nreasons. For example, if a fully rational version of Watson\u2019s squash\nplayer were to contemplate the situation of his actual, less than\nfully-rational self, he would be aware of his actual self\u2019s\ndisposition to irrational anger, and would therefore want his actual\nself not to cross the court to shake the winner\u2019s hand. The advice\nmodel may therefore yield the correct result that the actual player\nhas a reason not cross the court. However, as Bedke (2010) emphasizes,\nthis leaves an important puzzle about why each agent\u2019s counterfactual,\nmore fully rational self, would have desires about what her actual\nself does.\n",
