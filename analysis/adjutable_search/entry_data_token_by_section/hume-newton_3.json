    "main_text": "In What Sense Was Hume a Newtonian? || Experimentalism\n4.1 Experimentalism\n\nIt is often argued that the subtitle of the Treatise,\n\u201cAttempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into\nMoral Subjects\u201d, shows Hume\u2019s self-conscious debt to\nNewton. Experiments certainly play an important role in Newton\u2019s\nscience. But only after 1712 does Newton refer to his own philosophy\nas \u201cexperimental\u201d (in the context of his polemic with\nLeibniz; see Shapiro 2004). In general, Newton emphasizes the\nmathematical nature of his philosophy; he calls attention to this in\nthe full title of the Principia: Mathematical Principles of\nNatural Philosophy.\n\nHowever one interprets Hume\u2019s \u201cexperimental method\u201d,\nit is in no sense mathematical. Hume\u2019s so-called\n\u201cexperiments\u201d do not have the tacit logic of Newtonian\nexperiments; they almost never offer measurements (which are very\nimportant for Newton\u2019s focus on successive approximation); they\ndo not connect to a tight mathematical structure (Smith 2002).\nMoreover, by the standards of Newtonian natural philosophy, many of\nHume\u2019s so-called \u201cexperiments\u201d, for all their\ningenuity (see, e.g., the eight experiments at THN 2.2.2), have a\nrather simple structure. They are more akin to systematic observations\n(cf. THN I.8, 1.3.8.3, 1.3.12.11, 3.3.1.10). In fact, there is\n(almost) nothing to distinguish Humean \u201cexperiment\u201d from\nnormal, daily experience. In Hume the word \u201cexperiment\u201d\nseems to be nearly synonymous with \u201cexperience\u201d, which is\nnot uncommon in the period. This interpretation is also suggested by\nHume\u2019s description of his experiments as being based on \u201ca\ncautious observation of human life\u201d (THN\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d). This is why Hume can claim that \n\n\nexperimental inference and reasoning concerning the actions of others\nenters so much into human life, that no man, while awake, is ever a\nmoment without employing it. (EHU 8.1.17) \n\n\nEven if we allow for some hyperbole, it would betray considerable\nignorance to confuse Newton\u2019s \u201cexperimental method\u201d\nwith ordinary human \u201cexperimental inference and\nreasoning\u201d.\n\nSo it is not so much the production of data that makes Hume\u2019s\nmethod experimental rather than his way of \u201cprocessing\u201d\nthe data gathered in various forms of experiments. This method can be\nreconstructed as a version of analysis and synthesis inspired by\nNewton\u2019s Opticks (see\n section 4.8\n below), that begins with phenomena from the historical and everyday\nobservation of human behavior, and its analysis proceeds by such\n\u201cexperiments \u2026 judiciously collected and\ncompar\u2019d\u201d (THN I.10), in order to arrive at analogies\namong various instances \u201cfrom the observation of several\nparallel instances\u201d (EHU 8.13). The products of comparative\nanalysis so conducted are the principles of various faculties, like\nperception, imagination, reason, etc., whose interaction results in\nideas and impressions causing behaviour, but their contribution can\nhardly be measured and the principles of their interaction can hardly\nbe quantified\u2014not even in principle (see also Hume\u2019s\nanti-mathematicism discussed in\n section 4.7).\n So their relations cannot be represented in an algebraic way, in\nterms of relations of quantities, so they cannot be mathematized\neither. Instead, they remain qualitatively different principles of\nhuman nature, and the explanation of human phenomena consists in a\ndescription of how these principles with their distinctive\ncharacteristics figure in producing them.\n\nThese findings are generalized by induction: \u201cWhat I discover to\nbe true in some instances, I suppose to be so in all\u201d (THN\n2.1.5.1), and consequently, they are fallible, and the account of\nhuman nature founded on them may be misconstrued (THN 1.2.5.19). Even\nif it is sometimes possible \n\n\nto attain what natural philosophers, after Lord BACON, have affected\nto call the experimentum crucis, or that experiment which points out\nthe right way in any doubt or ambiguity. (EPM 5.17) \n\n\nIt is rarely so. Therefore, inquiry into moral matters is just as\nopen-ended as inquiry into natural matters, and the cure is the same\nhere as there, pretty much as Newton envisaged: it is in further\nenquiry (Smith 2002: 160\u2013161). So, for Hume experimental\nfindings can and need to be further refined by methods that rightly\nbelong to the family of Newtonian successive approximations: by\nexploring exceptions and limitations, or by eliminating superfluous\nconditions in order to identify the efficacious one (Demeter 2019b). One could see this feature\nof Hume\u2019s method as anticipating Mill\u2019s method of\ndifference as much as resembling Newton of Opticks (see\n Section 3.3 of the entry on John Stuart Mill).\n",
