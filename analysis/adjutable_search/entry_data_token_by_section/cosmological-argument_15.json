    "main_text": "The Kal\u0101m Cosmological Argument || The Big Bang Theory of Cosmic Origins\n7.4 The Big Bang Theory of Cosmic Origins\n\nOne of Craig and Sinclair\u2019s a posteriori arguments for\n premise 2\n invokes the Big Bang theory of cosmic origins. Since the universe is\nexpanding as the galaxies recede from each other, if we reverse the\ndirection of our view and look back in time, the farther we look, the\ndenser the universe becomes. If we push backwards far enough, we find\nthat the universe reaches a state of compression where the density and\ngravitational force are infinite. This unique singularity constitutes\nthe beginning of the universe\u2014of matter, energy, space, time,\nand all physical laws. It is not that the universe arose out of some\nprior state, for there was no prior state. Since time too comes to be,\none cannot ask what happened before the initial event. Neither should\none think that the universe expanded from some state of infinite\ndensity into space; space too came to be in that event. Since\nthe Big Bang initiates the very laws of physics, one cannot expect any\nscientific or physical explanation of this singularity.\n\nOne picture, then, is of the universe beginning in a singular,\nnon-temporal event roughly 13\u201314 billion years ago. Something,\nperhaps a quantum vacuum, came into existence. Its tremendous energy\ncaused it, in the first fractions of a second, to expand or inflate\nand explode, creating the four-dimensional space-time universe that we\nexperience today. How this all happened in the first \\(10^{-35}\\)\nseconds and subsequently is a matter of serious speculation and\ndebate. What advocates of\n premise 2\n maintain is that since the universe and all its material elements\noriginate in the Big Bang, the universe is temporally finite and thus\nhad a beginning. (For a detailed consideration of cosmogenic theories\nfrom the kal\u0101m perspective, see Craig and Sinclair 2009:\n125\u2013182; for the counter discussion see Gr\u00fcnbaum 1991). By\nitself, of course, this reasoning, even if accurate, leaves it the\ncase that\n premise 2\n and hence\n conclusion 3\n are only probably true, dependent on accepted cosmogenic\ntheories.\n\nSeveral replies to this argument can be made. First, questions have\nbeen raised about the adequacy of the theory of inflation to explain\nthe expansion of the universe. One problem is predictability, for on\nthis view anything that can happen will happen, an infinite number of\ntimes (Steinhardt 2011: 42). Further, the argument presupposes that\nthe General Theory of Relativity applies to the beginning of the\nuniverse, but some doubt that this is so, given that it cannot\nadequately account for the quantum gravity involved. \n\nSecond, some have suggested that since we cannot \u201cexclude the\npossibility of a prior phase of existence\u201d (Silk 2001: 63), it\nis possible that the universe has cycled through oscillations, perhaps\ninfinitely, so that Big Bangs occurred not once but an infinite number\nof times in the past and will do so in the future. The current\nuniverse is a \u201creboot\u201d of previous universes that have\nexpanded and then contracted (Musser 2004).\n\nThe traditional idea of an oscillating universe faced significant\nproblems. For one, no set of physical laws accounts for a series of\ncyclical universe-collapses and re-explosions. That the universe once\nexploded into existence provides no evidence that the event could\nreoccur even once, let alone an infinite number of times, should the\nuniverse collapse. Second, even an oscillating universe seems to be\nfinite (Smith, in Craig and Smith 1993: 113). Further, the cycle of\ncollapses and expansions would not, as was pictured, be periodic (of\neven duration). Rather, entropy would rise from cycle to cycle, so\nthat even were a series of universe-oscillations possible, they would\nbecome progressively longer (Davies 1992: 52; Tolman 1934). If the\nuniverse were without beginning, by now that cycle would be infinite\nin duration, without any hope of contraction. Fourth, although each\nrecollapse would destroy the components of the universe, the radiation\nwould remain, so that each successive cycle would add to the total.\n\n\nResponding to these issues, recently proposed cosmologies based on\nstring theory have given new life to a cyclic view. For example, Paul\nSteinhardt and Neil Turok have proposed a cyclic cosmological model\nwhere the universe repeatedly transitions from a big bang to a big\ncrunch to a big bang, and so on. They contend that \n\n\nthe Universe is flat, rather than closed. The transition from\nexpansion to contraction is caused by introducing negative potential\nenergy, rather than spatial curvature. Furthermore, the cyclic\nbehavior depends in an essential way on having a period of accelerated\nexpansion after the radiation and matter-dominated phases.\nDuring the accelerated expansion phase, the Universe approaches a\nnearly vacuous state, restoring very nearly identical local conditions\nas existed in the previous cycle prior to the contraction phase.\n(Steinhardt and Turok 2002: 2) \n\n\nDark energy becomes a key player in all of this. On the\nkal\u0101m view, the amount of dark energy in the universe\nmakes a return to its original state impossible. The universe is not\ncyclical but will die a cold death. On a cyclic view, dark energy\naccelerates the expansion of the universe needed \u201cto dilute the\nentropy, black holes and other debris produced in the previous cycle\nso that the universe is returned to its original pristine vacuum state\nbefore it begins to contract, bounce, and begin a cycle anew\u201d\n(Steinhardt and Turok 2001: 1436). \n\nThis specific cyclic theory has been challenged, and other cyclic\ncosmological theories have been proposed. What this shows is that any\nattempt to support the second premise of the kal\u0101m\nargument by accepting or refuting scientific cosmologies will\nencounter an ever-changing scene, given the speculative nature of\ncosmology. Thus, while Craig and Sinclair (2009: 150\u201374)\ncritically evaluate current contenders as not being viable, changes in\nand development of these theories and the inevitable development of\nothers make for unending point-counterpoint. \n",
