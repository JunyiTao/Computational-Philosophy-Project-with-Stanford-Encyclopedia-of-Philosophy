    "main_text": "Paradoxes || The Bootstrap Paradoxes\n3.1 The Bootstrap Paradoxes\n\nThe bootstrap paradoxes arise in cases where you have a causal chain\nconsisting of particular events in which \\(a\\) causes \\(b, b\\) causes\n\\(c\\), and \\(c\\) causes \\(a\\). The problem here is that the occurrence\nof \\(a\\) presupposes the occurrence of \\(c\\); in other words, the\ncause presupposes its effect. But how can something be required of\nwhat itself requires? Indeed this seems paradoxical. Some philosophers\ntherefore think that this makes the idea of causal loops incoherent.\nHugh Mellor even believes that \n\n\nthe possibility of causal loops can be excluded a priori, and\nso therefore can the closed timelike paths entailed by closed time,\nbackward time-travel and all kinds of backward causation. (1991: 191).\n\n\n\nHis proof goes like this. Take four chains of events. Each of them\nconsists of three particular events \\(a, b\\), and \\(c\\), all different\ntokens of the same kind of events \\(A, B\\) and \\(C\\). We then\nconstruct the chain such that\n\n\\(b \\Rightarrow c \\Rightarrow a\\)\n\\({\\sim}b \\Rightarrow{\\sim}c \\Rightarrow{\\sim}a\\)\n\\(b \\Rightarrow c \\Rightarrow{\\sim}a\\)\n\\({\\sim}b \\Rightarrow{\\sim}c \\Rightarrow a\\)\n\n\nThe first two sequences may be called G-chains and the other two\nH-chains. Moreover, Mellor assumes that all tokens of \\(A, B\\) and\n\\(C\\) are distributed among the four chains so that the number of\nchains is exactly the same, namely one fourth of the sequences. Mellor\nthen defines a causal relation between two singular events \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) in terms of a situation \\(k\\) which makes \\(b\\) more likely to\noccur given \\(a\\) than without \\(a\\), i.e., \\(\\rP(b\\mid a) \\gt\n\\rP(b\\mid {\\sim}a)\\). But we can see that the number of chains in\nwhich \\(b\\) is combined with \\(a\\) is equal to the number of chains in\nwhich \\(b\\) is not combined with \\(a\\). In fact we have that\n\\(\\rP(b\\mid a) =\\) \\(\\rP({\\sim}b\\mid {\\sim}a) =\\) \\(\\rP(b\\mid {\\sim}a)\n=\\) \\(\\rP({\\sim}b\\mid a)\\). From this it follows that a particular\n\\(b\\)\u2019s chance in \\(k\\) cannot increase with respect to \\(a\\)\ncompared to its chance without \\(a\\). Hence \\(a\\) cannot affect \\(b\\),\nand therefore causal loops are impossible.\n\nSome philosophers have not found this argument very convincing. Faye\n(1994) has pointed to the following problematic issues. First, Mellor\nmeasures the probability of singular events (propensities) instead of\nthe probability of certain kinds of events. Second, he does not\ndifferentiate between circumstances in which a \\(B\\) is followed by an\n\\(A\\) and those in which a \\(B\\) is not followed by an \\(A\\). The\nargument is valid only if it can be proved, and not be stipulated,\nthat (1) and (3) happen surrounded by the same facts. Many people\nwould say that in a world of (1) must be different from a world of (3)\nin some other important respects than merely containing \\(a\\) or\n\\({\\sim}a\\), especially since Mellor claims that the argument is valid\nfor deterministic situations as well. Third, the equal distribution of\nthe various chains seems quite selective. In Mellor\u2019s G&H\nworld, in which the number of the four chains is equal, and therefore\nin which the probabilities are equal, there cannot be any causal\nrelationship between the individual \\(b\\) and the individual \\(a\\) due\nto the fact that the occurrence of \\(a\\) or \\({\\sim}a\\) happens under\nexactly the same circumstances given \\(b\\). Finally, fourth, it seems\nappropriate to claim that any negative argument, like Mellor\u2019s,\nshould be able to show that what holds true of one world can be proved\nto hold true of every other world similar in all relevant respects,\nbut in which G-chains and H-chains are not equally distributed.\n\nIt is clear that any world which contains G-chains rather than\nH-chains does not show the same inconsistency as Mellor\u2019s\nG&H-world does. If it can be proved that causal loops in such\nworlds are consistent with the adopted definition, then causal loops\nare possible. In other words, if we set up a consistent model in which\n\\(A\\) increases the probability of \\(B\\), and \\(B\\) increases the\nprobability of \\(A\\), we have then proven that causal loops are\npossible and that Mellor\u2019s argument is invalid. The claim is\ntherefore that both\n\n\\(\\rP(A\\mid B) \\gt \\rP(A\\mid {\\sim}B)\\)\n\\(\\rP(B\\mid A) \\gt \\rP(B\\mid {\\sim}A),\\)\n\n\ncan be shown to be true with respect to a world containing \\(A\\)s and\n\\(B\\)s. Assume the following probabilities, which hold for the\ndistributions among \\(A, {\\sim}A, B\\), and \\({\\sim}B\\), are\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\rP(A \\amp B) &= 0.7 \\\\\n\\rP(A \\amp{\\sim}B) &= 0.1 \\\\\n\\rP({\\sim}A \\amp B) &= 0.1 \\\\\n\\rP({\\sim}A \\amp{\\sim}B) &= 0.1.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nOn the basis of the definition of the conditional probability, we\nget \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\rP(A\\mid B) = \\frac{\\rP(A \\amp B)}{\\rP(B)} &= 7/8 \\\\\n\\rP(A\\mid {\\sim}B) = \\frac{\\rP(A \\amp{\\sim}B)}{\\rP({\\sim}B)} &= 1/2 \\\\\n\\rP(B\\mid A) = \\frac{\\rP(A \\amp B)}{\\rP(A)} &= 7/8; \\\\\n\\rP(B\\mid {\\sim}A) = \\frac{\\rP({\\sim}A \\amp B)}{\\rP({\\sim}A)} &= 1/2. \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus (i) and (ii) are both true with respect to the stated world;\nhence we have proven, according to Mellor\u2019s own definition of\ncausality, that it is consistent to talk about causal loops. Mellor\nhas not been able to establish any satisfying a priori\nargument against causal loops or backwards causation.\n\nMoreover, even if one assumes that Mellor were correct in ruling out\ncausal loops a priori, he may be wrong in holding that this\nimpossibility entails the impossibility of time travel as well as\nbackward causation. Mellor\u2019s argument presupposes that it is the\nsame kind of processes obeying the same kind of macroscopic physical\nlaws which enters into both the forward and backward part of the\ncausal loop. This assumption may hold for time travel but not for\nbackward causation.\n",
