    "main_text": "Questions about Realism and Explanation || Realism and Chaos\n5.1 Realism and Chaos\n\nChaos raises a number of questions about scientific realism (see\nscientific realism)\n only some of which will be touched on here. First and foremost,\nscientific realism is usually formulated as a thesis about the status\nof unobservable terms in scientific theories and their relationship to\nentities, events and processes in the actual world. In other words,\ntheories make various claims about features of the world and these\nclaims are at least approximately true. But as we saw in\n \u00a72,\n there are serious questions about formulating a theory of chaos, let\nalone determining how this theory fares under scientific realism. It\nseems more reasonable, then, to discuss some less ambitious realist\nquestions regarding chaos: Is chaos an actual phenomenon? Do the various\ndenizens of chaos, like fractals, actually exist? \n\nThis leads us back to the faithful model assumption\n (\u00a71.2.3).\n Recall this assumption maintains that our model equations faithfully\ncapture target system behavior and that the model state space\nfaithfully represents the actual possibilities of the target\nsystem. Is the sense of faithfulness here that of actual\ncorrespondence between mathematical models and features of actual\nsystems? Or can faithfulness be understood in terms of empirical\nadequacy alone, a primarily instrumentalist construal of faithfulness?\nIs a realist construal of faithfulness threatened by the mapping\nbetween models and systems potentially being one-to-many or\nmany-to-many? \n\nA related question is whether or not our mathematical models are\nsimulating target systems or merely mimicking their behavior. To be\nsimulating a system suggests that there is some actual correspondence\nbetween the model and the target system it is designed to capture. On\nthe other hand, if a mathematical model is merely mimicking the\nbehavior of a target system, there is no guarantee that the model has\nany genuine correspondence to the actual properties of the target\nsystem. The model merely imitates behavior. These issues become crucial\nfor modern techniques of building nonlinear dynamical models from large\ntime series data sets (e.g., Smith 1992), for example the sunspot\nrecord or the daily closing value of a particular stock for some\nspecific period of time. In such cases, after performing some tests on\nthe data set, the modeler sets to work constructing a mathematical\nmodel that reproduces the time series as its output. Do such models\nonly mimic behavior of target systems? Where does realism come into the\npicture?\n\n\nA further question regarding chaos and realism is the following: Is\nchaos only a feature of our mathematical models or is it a genuine\nfeature of actual systems in our world? This question is well\nillustrated by a peculiar geometric structure of dissipative chaotic\nmodels called a strange attractor, which can form based upon\nthe stretching and folding of trajectories in state space. Strange\nattractors normally only occupy a subregion of state space, but once a\ntrajectory wanders close enough to the attractor, it is caught near the\nsurface of the attractor for the rest of its future.\n\n\nOne of the characteristic features of strange attractors is that\nthey posses self-similar structure. Magnify any small\nportion of the attractor and you would find that the magnified portion\nwould look identical to the regular-sized region. Magnify\nthe magnified region and you would see the identical structure repeated\nagain. Continuous repetition of this process would yield the same\nresults. The self-similar structure is repeated on arbitrarily\nsmall scales. An important geometric implication of\nself-similarity is that there is no inherent size scale so\nthat we can take as large a magnification of as small a region of the\nattractor as we want and a statistically similarly structure will be\nrepeated (Hilborn 1994, p.\u00a056). In other words, strange attractors for\nchaotic models have an infinite number of layers of repetitive\nstructure. This type of structure allows trajectories to remain\nwithin a bounded region of state space by folding and intertwining with\none another without ever intersecting or repeating themselves\nexactly.\n\n\nStrange attractors also are often characterized as possess noninteger\nor fractal dimension (though not all strange attractors have\nsuch dimensionality). The type of dimensionality we usually meet in\nphysics as well as in everyday experience is characterized by\nintegers. A point has dimension zero; a line has dimension one; a\nsquare has dimension two; a cube has dimension three and so on. As a\ngeneralization of our intuitions regarding dimensionality, consider a\nlarge square. Suppose we fill this large square with smaller squares\neach having an edge length of \\(\\varepsilon\\). The number of small squares\nneeded to completely fill the space inside the large square\nis \\(N(\\varepsilon)\\). Now repeat this process of filling the large\nsquare with small squares, but each time let the length \\(\\varepsilon\\) get\nsmaller and smaller. In the limit as \\(\\varepsilon\\) approached zero, we\nwould find that the ratio\n\\(\\ln N(\\varepsilon)/\\ln(1 / \\varepsilon)\\) equals two\njust as we would expect for a 2-dimensional square. You can imagine\nthe same exercise of filling a large 3-dimensional cube (a room, say)\nwith smaller cubes and in the limit of \\(\\varepsilon\\) approaching zero, we\nwould arrive at a dimension of three.\n\n\nWhen we apply this generalization of dimensionality to the geometric\nstructure of strange attractors, we often find noninteger\ndimensionality. Roughly this means that if we try to apply the same\nprocedure of \u201cfilling\u201d the structure formed by the strange\nattractor with small squares or cubes, in the limit as \\(\\varepsilon\\)\napproaches zero the result is noninteger. Whether one is examining a\nset of nonlinear mathematical equations or analyzing the time series\ndata from an experiment, the presence of self-similarity or noninteger\ndimension are indications that the chaotic behavior of the system\nunder study is dissipative (nonconservative, doesn\u2019t conserve energy)\nrather than Hamiltonian (does conservative energy).\n\n\nAlthough there is no universally accepted definition for strange\nattractors or fractal dimension among mathematicians, the more serious\nquestion is whether strange attractors and fractal dimensions are\nproperties of our models only or also of actual-world systems. For\ninstance, empirical investigations of a number of actual-world systems\nindicate that there is no infinitely repeating self-similar structure\nlike that of strange attractors (Avnir, et al. 1998; see also\nShenker 1994). At most, one finds self-similar structure repeated on\ntwo or three spatial scales in the reconstructed state space and that\nis it. This appears to be more like a prefractal, where\nself-similar structure exists on only a finite number of length\nscales. That is to say, prefractals repeat their structure under\nmagnification only a finite number of times rather than infinitely as\nin the case of a fractal. So this seems to indicate that there are no\ngenuine strange attractors with fractal dimension in actual systems, but\npossibly only attractors having prefractal geometries with\nself-similarity on a limited number of spatial scales.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the dissipative chaotic models used to\ncharacterize some actual-world systems all exhibit strange attractors\nwith fractal geometries. So it looks like fractal geometries in chaotic\nmodel state spaces bear no relationship to the pre-fractal features of\nactual-world systems. In other words, these fractal features of many of\nour models are clearly false of the target systems though the models\nthemselves may still be useful for helping scientists locate interesting\ndynamics of target systems characterized by prefractal properties.\nScientific realism and usefulness look to part ways here. At least many\nof the strange attractors of our models play the role of useful\nfictions.\n\n\n There are caveats to this line of thinking, however. First, the\nprefractal character of the analyzed data sets (e.g. by\nAvnir, et al. 1998) could be an artifact of the way data is\nmassaged before it is analyzed or due to the analog-to-digital\nconversion that must take place before data analysis can\nbegin. Reducing real number valued data to a finite string of would destroy\nfractal structure. If so, the infinitely self-similar structures of\nfractals in our models might not be such a bad approximation after\nall. \n\nA different reason, though, to suspect that physical systems cannot\nhave such self-repeating structures \u201call the way down\u201d is\nthat at some point the classical world gives way to the quantum world,\nwhere things change so drastically that there cannot be a strange\nattractor because the state space changes. Hence, we are applying a\nmodel carrying a tremendous amount of excess, fictitious structure to\nunderstand features of physical systems. This looks like a problem\nbecause one of the key structures playing a crucial role in chaos\nexplanations\u2014the infinitely intricate structure of the strange\nattractor\u2014would then be absent from the corresponding physical system.\n\n\nAccording to Peter Smith (1998, ch.\u00a03), one might be justified in\nemploying obviously false chaos models because the infinitely\nintricate structure of strange attractors (1) is the result of\nrelatively simple stretching and folding mechanisms and (2) many of\nthe points in state space of interest are invariant under this\nstretching and folding mechanism. These features represent kinds of\nsimplicity that can be had at the (perhaps exorbitant!) cost of\nfictitious infinite structure. The strange attractor exhibits this\nstructure and the attractor is a sign of some stretching and folding\nprocess. The infinite structure is merely geometric extra baggage, but\nthe robust properties like period-doubling sequences, onset of chaos,\nand so forth are real enough. This has the definite flavor of being\nantirealist about some key elements of explanation in chaos\n (\u00a75.2)\n and has been criticized as such (Koperski 2001).\n\n\nInstead of trying to squeeze chaos into scientific realism\u2019s\nmold, then, perhaps it is better to turn to an alternative account of\nrealism, structural realism.\n Roughly, the\nidea is that realism in scientific practices hinges on the structural\nrelations of phenomena. So structural realism tends to focus on the\ncausal structures in well-confirmed scientific hypotheses and theories.\nThe kinds of universal structural features identified in chaotic\nphenomena in realms as diverse as physics, biology and economics is\nvery suggestive of some form of structural realism and, indeed, look to\nplay key roles in chaos explanations (see below). Though, again, there\nare significant worries that infinitely repeating self-similar\nstructure might not be realized in physical systems. On a structural\napproach to realism regarding chaos models, one faces the difficulty\nthat strange attractors are at best too gross an approximation to the\nstructure of physical attractors and at worst terribly misleading.\n\n\nPerhaps other kinds of geometric structures associated with chaos\nwould qualify on a structural realist view. After all, it also seems to\nbe the case that realism for chaos models has more to do with\nprocesses\u2014namely stretching and folding mechanisms at work in\ntarget systems. But here the connection with realism and chaos models\nwould come indirectly via an appeal to the causal processes at work in\nthe full nonlinear models taken to represent physical systems. Perhaps\nthe fractal character of strange attractors is an artifact introduced\nthrough the various idealizations and approximations used to derive\nsuch chaotic models. If so, then perhaps there is another way to arrive\nat more realistic chaos models that have prefractal attractors.\n\n",
