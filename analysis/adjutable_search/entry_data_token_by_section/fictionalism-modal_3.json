    "main_text": "Types of Modal Fictionalism || Fictionalism about Modality and Modal Fictionalism\n1.4 Fictionalism about Modality and Modal Fictionalism\n\nSo far, it has been taken for granted that the modal fictionalist\ntreats ordinary modal claims as sometimes literally true, and it is\nonly claims about possible worlds and their contents which the modal\nfictionalist will wish to claim are literally false, but true\naccording to a story. A more radical modal fictionalism is possible:\none in which modal claims themselves (such as the claim that there\ncould have been blue swans, or that necessarily, everything is\nself-identical) are not literally true, but only true according to a\nfiction. (In Nolan 1997a I called a version of modal fictionalism\nwhich took both claims about possible worlds and modal claims to be\ntrue only according to fictions broad modal\nfictionalism.)\n\nSuch extended fictionalism about modality could, I think, come in two\nmain varieties. One would maintain that modal operators (and\nassociated pieces of language like essential predication,\ncounterfactual conditionals, and perhaps other things like assignments\nof probabilities) lacked literal application: that all statements\nprefixed with a modal operator were either uniformly literally\ntruthvalueless or uniformly literally false. This faces several\nimmediate formal difficulties, given the usual characterisation of the\nmodal\n operators.[4]\n\n\nA less blanket rejection of modality might only insist on the\nfalsehood of some modal claims: think of the analogy of a moral\nnihilist who rejects only \u201cpositive\u201d moral claims, such as\nthat taking property without permission is wrong, or that it is good\nto help the ill, but accepts that it is not wrong to take property\nwithout permission (since nothing is wrong) and that it is not good to\nhelp the ill (since nothing is good). This fictionalist about modality\nmight reject the literal truth of all claims about necessity, for\nexample (and, in virtue of the interdefinition, accept the literal\ntruth of all possibility claims). Or she might assert as little as is\nneeded to preserve the basic modal inferences from actuality: for\nexample, every true P is possibly true, and actually true,\nbut this is the limit of literal modal truth. This would be more\nanalogous to the fictionalist about possible worlds who nevertheless\nthinks that there is one possible world \u2014 the actual, and one\ncollection of possible objects \u2014 the actual objects. \n\nFictionalism of this sort extending to modal discourse as well should\nbe a position worthy of investigation by those attracted to\nfictionalist strategies and mistrustful of modality. Since it seems to\nlack contemporary advocates, however, it shall not be dwelled upon\n here.[5]\n\n",
