    "main_text": "Further Issues || Manipulation and Intent\n4.3 Manipulation, Vulnerability, and Oppression\n\nThe idea that manipulation can be a tool for the powerful to oppress\nthe less powerful is not new, even if the term\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d has not always been used to express it.\nMarxian notions of ideology and false consciousness as mechanisms that\nfacilitate the exploitation of workers by capital clearly resemble the\nconcept of manipulation as it is being used here. (Allen Wood explores\nsome of these connections in Wood 2014.) More recently, the concept of\n\u201cgas lighting\u201d has become a common feature of feminist\ntheorizing about how the patriarchy manipulates women into doubting\ntheir own judgments about reality. On a smaller scale, a bevy of\nself-help books focus on how manipulative tactics can be used to\ncreate and maintain subordination within relationships (Braiker 2004;\nSimon 2010; Kole 2016).\n\nA relative lack of socio-political power is almost certainly one\nsource of vulnerability to manipulation. But there are likely others\nas well. The trickery model of manipulation suggests that people who\nare less intellectually sophisticated are especially vulnerable to\ntrickery and therefore to manipulation. The pressure model suggests\nthat financial, social, and emotional desperation may make one\nespecially vulnerable to pressures created by threats to worsen an\nalready tenuous situation. Moreover, some forms of manipulation, like\nso-called \u201cnegging\u201d (tactic 6) and gaslighting\n (tactic 8)\n may work to increase the target\u2019s vulnerability to further\nmanipulation.\n\nHowever, it may also be true that manipulation is a tempting tool for\nuse by the vulnerable against the powerful. As Patricia Greenspan\nnotes,\n\n\nmanipulation is often recommended as a strategy particularly for\nwomen, or simply is treated as characteristic of women, at least in a\nworld where women cannot act openly to achieve their ends. A further\nargument for manipulation in these cases appeals to the limits on what\nis possible in a position of subordination. (Greenspan 2003: 156)\n\n\nSimilarly, Len Bowers observes that\n\n\nit is possible to interpret manipulation as a normal response to\nincarceration, rather than as being a pathological style of\nbehavior,\n\n\u2026\n\nmanipulative strategies may be viewed as a low-key way of fighting\nback at a system which has deprived the prisoner of normal freedom.\n(Bowers 2003: 330)\n\n\nFinally, it seems likely that one reason why children often resort to\nmanipulative tactics is that they often lack any other (or any other\nequally effective) way to get what they want.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the idea that the idea that manipulation\nundermines autonomous choice might itself be used, somewhat\nparadoxically, to undermine autonomous choice, especially among the\nnon-elite. This point is comes out forcefully in a comment by Sarah\nSkwire (2015, Other Internet Resources) on George Akerlof and Robert\nShiller\u2019s book, Phishing for Phools (Akerlof &\nShiller 2015). Akerlof and Shiller discuss a number of advertising,\nsales, and marketing practices that they deem manipulative. Skwire\nsuggests that the reason why Akerlof and Shiller call these practices\nmanipulative is that consumers subjected to them make choices that\nAkerlof and Shiller think are sufficiently irrational that they would\nonly be made under the influence of manipulation. Skwire writes that\nthis approach to detecting manipulation demonstrates \u201ccontempt\nfor the decisions made by people who are poorer and from a lower\nsocial class than the authors\u201d (Skwire 2015, Other Internet\nResources). In short, she suggests that Akerlof and Shiller are too\nquick to suspect manipulation in cases where people make different\ndecisions from the ones they think best. Whether or not we agree with\nSkwire\u2019s criticisms of Akerlof and Shiller, her point serves as\na cautionary one: Even if we accept that manipulation undermines\nautonomous choice, we must be careful not to use that as a reason to\nsuspect that people who make different choices from what we think are\nbest must therefore be victims of manipulation. It would be\nironic\u2014and unjust\u2014to use the idea that manipulation is a\nwrongful interference with autonomy as a weapon to delegitimize the\nautonomous choices of people with whom we disagree or whose\nsituations, needs, and values we do not understand.\n",
