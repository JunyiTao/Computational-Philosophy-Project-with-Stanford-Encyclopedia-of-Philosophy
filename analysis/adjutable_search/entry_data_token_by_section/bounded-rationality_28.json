A property like systematic bias may be viewed as a\nfault or an advantage depending on how outcomes are scored\n (section 4).\n A full reckoning of the costs of operating a decision procedure may\ntip the balance in favor of a model that is sub-optimal when costs are\nnot considered, even when there is agreement of how outcomes are to be\nscored\n (sections 2.1).\n Desirable behavior, such as prosocial norms, may be impossible within\nan idealized model but commonplace in several different types of\nnon-idealized models\n (section 5.2).\n\nAccounts of bounded rationality typically invoke one of two types of\nnormative standards, a coherence standard or an accuracy standard.\nAmong the most important insights from the study of boundedly rational\njudgment and decision making is that, not only is it possible to meet\none standard without meeting the other, but meeting one standard may\ninhibit meeting the other.\n\nCoherence standards in bounded rationality typically appeal to\nprobability, statistical decision theory, or propositional logic. The\n\u201cstandard picture\u201d of rational reasoning, according to\nEdward Stein,\n\n\nis to reason in accordance with principles of reasoning that are based\non rules of logic, probability theory, and so forth. If the standard\npicture of reasoning is right, principles of reasoning that are based\non such rules are normative principles of reasoning, namely\nthey are principles we ought to reason in accordance with.\n(Stein 1996: 1.2)\n\n\nThe coherence standards of logic and probability are usually invoked when\nthere are experimental results purporting to violate those\nstandards, particularly in the biases and heuristics literature\n (section 7.1).\n However, little is said about how and when our reasoning ought to be\nin accordance with these standards or even what, precisely, the applicable \nnormative standards of logic and probability are. Stein\ndiscusses the logical rule of And-Elimination and a normative\nprinciple for belief that it supports, one where believing the\nconjunction birds sing and bees waggle commits you rationally\nto believing each conjunct. Yet Stein switches to probability to\ndiscuss what principle ought to govern conjoining two beliefs.\nWhy?\n\nPropositional logic and probability are very different formalisms \n(Haenni, Romeijn, Wheeler, & Williamson 2011). For one thing, the\ntruth-functional semantics of logic is compositional whereas\nprobability is not compositional, except when events are\nprobabilistically independent. Why then is the elimination rule from\nlogic and the introduction rule from probability the standard rather\nthan the elimination rule from probability (i.e., marginalization) and the\nintroduction rule from logic (i.e., adjunction)? Answering this question\nrequires a positive account of what \u201cbased on\u201d,\n\u201canchored in\u201d, or other metaphorical relationships amount\nto. But, in appeals to principles of reasoning, typically there is no analog to the\nrepresentation theorems of expected utility theory \n (section 1.1)\n specifying the relationship between qualitative judgments and their\nlogical or numerical representation, and no account of the conditions\nunder which such relationships hold.\n\nThe second type of normative standard assesses the accuracy of a\njudgment or decision making process, where the focus is getting the\ncorrect answer. Consider the accuracy of a categorical judgment, such\nas predicting whether a credit-card transaction is fraudulent (\\(Y =\n1\\)) or legitimate (\\(Y = 0\\)). Classification accuracy is\nthe number of correct predictions from all predictions made, which is\noften expressed as a ratio. But classification accuracy can yield a\nmisleading assessment. For example, a method that always reported\ntransactions as legitimate, \\(Y = 0\\), would in fact yield a very high\naccuracy score (>97%) due to the very low rate (<3%) of\nfraudulent credit card transactions. The problem here is that\nclassification accuracy is a poor metric for problems that involve\nimbalanced classes with few positive instances (i.e., few cases where\n\\(Y=1\\)). More generally, a model with no predictive power can have\nhigh accuracy, and a model with comparatively lower accuracy can have\ngreater predictive power. This observation is referred to as the\naccuracy paradox.\n\nThe accuracy paradox is one motivation for introducing other measures\nof predictive performance. For our fraud detection problem there are\ntwo ways your prediction can be correct and two ways it can be wrong.\nA prediction can be correct by predicting that \\(Y=1\\) when in fact a\ntransaction is fraudulent (a true positive) or predicting\n\\(Y=0\\) when in fact a transaction is legitimate (a true\nnegative). Correspondingly, one may err by either predicting\n\\(Y=1\\) when in fact \\(Y=0\\) (a false positive) or predicting\n\\(Y=0\\) when in fact a transaction is fraudulent (a false\nnegative). These four possibilities are presented in the\nfollowing two-by-two contingency table, which is sometimes referred to\nas a confusion matrix:\n\n\n\nActual Class\n\n\n\\(Y\\)\n1\n0\n\nPredicted Class\n1\ntrue positive\nfalse positive \n\n0\nfalse negative\ntrue negative \n\n\nFor a binary classification problem involving N examples, each\nprediction will fall into one of these four categories. The\nperformance of your classifier with respect to those N examples\ncan then be assessed. A perfectly inaccurate classifier will have all\nzeros in the diagonal; a perfectly accurate classifier will have all\nzeros in the counterdiagonal. The precision of your\nclassifier is the ratio of true positives to all positive predictions,\nthat is true positives / (true positives + false\npositives). The recall of your classifier is the ratio\nof true positives to all true predictions, that is true\npositives / (true positives + false\nnegatives).\n\nThere are two points to notice. The first is that in practice there is\ntypically a trade-off between precision and recall, and the costs to\nyou of each will vary from one problem to another. A trade-off of\nprecision and recall that suits detecting credit card fraud may not\nsuit detecting cancer, even if the frequencies of positive instances\nare identical. The point of training a classifier on known data is to\nmake predictions on out of sample instances. So, tuning your\nclassifier to yield a suitable trade-off between precision and recall\nin your training data is no guarantee that you will see this trade-off\ngeneralize.\n\nThe moral is that to evaluate the performance of your classifier it is\nnecessary to specify the purpose for making the classification and\neven then good performance on your training data may not generalize.\nNone of this is antithetical to coherence reasoning per se, as we are\nmaking comparative judgments and reasoning by dominance. But putting\nthe argument in terms of coherence changes the objects of\nevaluation, moving from the point of view from the first person \ndecision maker to that of a third person decision modeler.\n",
