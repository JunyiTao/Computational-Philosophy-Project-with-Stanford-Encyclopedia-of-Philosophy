    "main_text": "Ad Hoc Hypotheses\n2. Ad Hoc Hypotheses\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate\n Dictionary,[2]\n something is \u2018ad hoc\u2019 if it is \u2018formed or used for\nspecific or immediate problems or needs\u2019. An ad hoc hypothesis\nthen is one formed to address a specific problem\u2014such as the\nproblem of immunizing a particular theory from falsification by\nanomalous data (and thereby accommodating that data). Consequently\nwhat makes a hypothesis ad hoc, in the ordinary English sense of the\nterm, has nothing to do with the content of the hypothesis but simply\nwith the motivation of the scientist who proposes it\u2014and it is\nunclear why there would be anything suspicious about such a\nmotivation. Nonetheless, ad hoc hypotheses have long been suspect in\ndiscussions of scientific method, a suspicion that resonates with the\npredictivist\u2019s skepticism about accommodation. \n\nFor Popper, a conjecture is ad hoc \u201cif it is\nintroduced\u2026to explain a particular difficulty,\nbut\u2026cannot be tested independently\u201d (Popper 1974: 986).\nThus Popper\u2019s conception of ad hocness added to the ordinary\nEnglish meaning a further requirement\u2014in the case of an ad hoc\nhypothesis that was simply introduced to explain a single phenomenon,\nthe ad hoc hypothesis has no testable consequences other than that\nphenomenon. In the case of an ad hoc theory modification introduced to\nresolve an anomaly for a theory, the modified theory had no testable\nconsequences other than those of the original theory. \n\nPopper offered two explications of why ad hoc hypotheses were suspect.\nOne was that if we offer T as an explanation of f, but\nthen cite f as the only reason we have to believe T,\nPopper claims that we have engaged in reasoning that is suspicious for\nreasons of circularity (Popper 1972: 192\u20133). This was arguably\nfallacious on Popper\u2019s part\u2014a circular proof would offer\none proposition, p, in support of a second proposition\nq, when q has already been offered in support of\np. But in the above example, while f is offered as\nevidence for T, T is offered as an explanation of (not\nas evidence for) f\u2014and thus there is no circular\nreasoning (Bamford 1993: 338). \n\nPopper\u2019s other explanation of why ad hoc hypotheses were\nregarded with suspicion was that they ran counter to the aim of\nscience, which for Popper included the proposal of theories with\nincreasing empirical content, viz., increasing falsifiability. Ad hoc\nhypotheses, for Popper, suffer from a lack of independent testability\nand thus reduce (or at least fail to increase) the testability of the\ntheories they modify (cf. above). However, Popper\u2019s claim that\nthe process of modifying a theory ad hoc tends to lead to insufficient\nfalsifiability and is \u2018unscientific practice\u2019 has been\nchallenged (e.g., Bamford 1993: 350). \n\nSubsequent authors argued that a hypothesis proposed for the sake of\nimmunizing a theory from falsification could be\n\u2018suspicious\u2019 for various reasons, and thus could be\n\u2018ad hoc\u2019 in various ways. Zahar (1973) argued that a\nhypothesis was ad hoc1 if it had no novel consequences as\ncompared with its predecessor (i.e. was not independently testable),\nad hoc2 if none of its novel predictions have actually been\nverified (either because it has not yet been tested or has been\nfalsified), and ad hoc3 \n\n\nif it is obtained from its predecessor through a modification of the\nauxiliary hypotheses which does not accord with the spirit of the\nheuristic of the programme. (1973: 101) \n\n\nBeyond Popper\u2019s criterion of a lack of independent testability\nthen, a hypothesis introduced to accommodate some datum could be ad\nhoc because it was simply unconfirmed (ad hoc2) or because\nit failed to cohere with the basic commitments of the research\nprogramme in which it is proposed (ad hoc3).\n\nAnother approach proposes that a hypothesis H introduced into a\ntheory T in response to an experimental result E is ad\nhoc if it is generally unsupported and appears to be a superficial\nattempt to paper over deep problems with a theory that is actually in\nneed of substantive revision. Thus to level the charge of ad hocness\nagainst a hypothesis was actually to direct serious skepticism toward\nthe theory the hypothesis was meant to rescue. This concept of ad\nhocness arguably makes sense of Einstein\u2019s critique of the\nLorentz-Fitzgerald contraction hypothesis as \u2018ad hoc\u2019 as a\nsupplementary hypothesis to the aether theory, and Pauli\u2019s\npostulation of the neutrino as an ad hoc rescue of classical quantum\nmechanics (Leplin 1975, 1982; for further discussion see Gr\u00fcnbaum\n1976).\n\nIt seems clearly true that the scientific community\u2019s judgment\nabout whether a hypothesis is ad hoc can change. Given this\nrevisability, and the aesthetic dimension of theory evaluation (which\nleaves assessment to some degree \u2018in the eye of the\nbeholder\u2019) there may be no particular point to embracing a\ntheory of ad hocness, if by the term \u2018ad hoc\u2019 we mean\n\u2018illegitimately proposed\u2019 (Hunt 2012).\n",
