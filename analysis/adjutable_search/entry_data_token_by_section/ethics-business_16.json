    "main_text": "Firms and workers || Whistleblowing\n6.4 Whistleblowing\n\nSuppose you discover, as Tyler Shultz did at Theranos in 2015, that\nyour firm is deceiving regulators and investors about the efficacy of\nits products. To stop this, one thing you might do is \u201cblow the\nwhistle\u201d by disclosing this information to a third party. While\nscholars give different definitions of whistleblowing (see, e.g.,\nBrenkert 2010; Davis 2003; DeGeorge 2009; Delmas 2015), the following\nelements are usually present: (1) insider status, (2) non-public\ninformation, (3) illegal or immoral activity, (4) avoidance of the\nusual chain of command in the firm, (5) intention to solve the\nproblem. In the above example, Shultz was a whistleblower because he\nwas (1) a Theranos employee (2) who disclosed non-public information\n(3) about illegal activity in the firm (4) to a state regulator (5) in\nan effort to stop that activity.\n\nDebate about whistleblowing tends to focus on the question of when\nwhistleblowing is justified\u2014in the sense of when it is\npermissible, or when it is required. This debate assumes that\nwhistleblowing requires justification, or is wrong, other things\nequal. Many business ethicists make this assumption on the grounds\nthat employees have a pro tanto duty of loyalty to their\nfirms (Elegido 2013). Against this, some argue that the relationship\nbetween the firm and the employee is purely transactional\u2014an\nexchange of money for labor (Duska 2000)\u2014and so is not\nnormatively robust enough to ground a duty of loyalty. (For a\ndiscussion of this issue, see the entry on\n loyalty.)\n\nOne prominent justification of whistleblowing is due to DeGeorge\n(2009). According to him, it is permissible for an employee to blow\nthe whistle when his doing so will prevent harm to society. (In a\nsimilar account, Brenkert [2010] says that the duty to blow the\nwhistle derives from a duty to prevent wrongdoing.) The duty to\nprevent harm can have more weight, if the harm is great enough, than\nthe duty of loyalty. To determine whether whistleblowing is not simply\npermissible but required, DeGeorge says, we must take into account the\nlikely success of the whistleblowing and its effects on the\nwhistleblower himself. Humans are tribal creatures, and whistleblowers\nare often treated badly by their colleagues. (Shultz and his family\nwere hounded by Theranos\u2019s powerful and well-connected lawyers,\nat a cost to them of hundreds of thousands of dollars.) So if\nwhistleblowing is unlikely to succeed, then it need not be attempted.\nThe lack of a moral requirement to blow the whistle in these cases can\nbe seen as a specific instance of the rule that individuals need not\nmake huge personal sacrifices to promote others\u2019 interests, even\nwhen those interests are important.\n\nAnother account of whistleblowing is given by Davis (2003). Like\nBrenkert (and unlike DeGeorge), Davis focuses on the wrongdoing that\nthe firm engages in (not the harm it causes). According to Davis,\nhowever, the point of whistleblowing is not so much to prevent the\nwrongdoing but to avoid one\u2019s own complicity in it. He says that\nan employee is required to blow the whistle on her firm when she\nbelieves that it is engaged in seriously wrongful behavior, and her\nwork for the firm \u201cwill contribute \u2026 to the wrong if\n\u2026 [she] [does] not publicly reveal what [she knows]\u201d\n(2003: 550). Davis\u2019s account limits whistleblowers to people who\nare currently firm insiders. Many find this counterintuitive, since it\nimplies that people often described as whistleblowers, like Jeffrey\nWigand (Brown & Williamson) and Edward Snowden (NSA), are not\nactually whistleblowers.\n",
