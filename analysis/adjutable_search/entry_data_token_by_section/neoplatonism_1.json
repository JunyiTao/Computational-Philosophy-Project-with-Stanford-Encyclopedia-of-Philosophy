    "main_text": "The One\n2. The One\nWhat was it that made the radically top-down idealism of the\nNeoplatonists so appealing? Disregarding in this context the\nreligious-sentimental appeal Neoplatonism undoubtedly must have had\nand perhaps still has, its philosophical attractiveness and\nsignificance lies in the fact that it offered a maximum of explanatory\npower on the basis of just one metaphysical principle. Even though the\nsystem coheres in such a way that it is possible to approach it from\nmany angles, it is perhaps best to begin at the top of the ontological\npyramid and to return to the question posed earlier: How is it\npossible to explain the world\u2019s emergence from a single divine\nprinciple of consciousness?\nIt may be useful first to state that the pagan Neoplatonists were\nnot creationists. That is to say, whatever account they were giving\nabout the universe\u2019s origin, this narrative was not to be\nmisunderstood as recounting a creation in time or at the very\nbeginning of time. Instead, they speculated that the process of the\nemergence of the universe from the divine principle, as they conceived\nof it (described below), has gone on forever, just as it continues at\nthis very moment and will continue to do so, sustaining a world\nwithout end. When the general outlook of Neoplatonism was appropriated\nand adapted to refine and articulate the creeds of Christianity,\nIslam, and Judaism, this feature of the doctrine, and the connected\ndoctrine of the eternity of the world, would become a vigorously\ndebated issue.\nSecond, unlike the ancient theologians of Israel and Egypt, the\nNeoplatonists did not think that the universe could spring from the\ndeity directly and in a way that surpasses all understanding, for\nexample by being thought and spoken into existence. Their more refined\nview was that reality emerged from \u201cthe First\u201d in coherent\nstages, in such a way that one stage functions as creative principle\nof the next.\nThis kind of emanationist cosmology rests on the tenet\u2014based\nto some extent in observation, but elevated by them to the status of a\nheuristic principle\u2014that every activity in the world is in some\nsense double insofar as it possesses both an inner and an outer\naspect.  For example, the inner activity of the sun (nuclear fusion,\nas we now know) has the outer effect of heat and light, themselves\nactivities as well. Or the inner activity of a tree that is determined\nby the kind of tree it is (its genetic code, we would now say;\nthe Neoplatonists spoke of an inherent formative principle,\nlogos) results in the bearing of a particular kind of fruit;\nor again, thoughts and feelings internal to human beings express\nthemselves in speech and actions. In each case, the outer effect is\nnot the purpose or end of the inner activity; rather, it is simply the\ncase that one falls out of the other and is concomitant with\nit. Furthermore, it is also the case that these outer activities will\ntypically be productive of yet other outer activities that are\nontologically more remote and derivative: Fruit serves as nourishment\nor poison for other individual life forms, and human speech and action\nconstitute, over time, a person\u2019s biography or a society\u2019s\nhistory. It is important to note that, in all cases, the outer\nactivity will not be some random affair, but rather something\nintimately connected with the inner activity it is an expression\nof. In other words, any inner activity will somehow prefigure the\ncharacter and nature of its outer effect.  Thus, the Neoplatonists\ninsisted that there is nothing on the lower ontological levels within\nthe chains of causality that is not somehow prefigured on the\ncorresponding higher levels. In general, no property emerges unless it\nis already in some way preformed and pre-existent in its cause.\nAs regards the very first principle of reality, conceived of as an\nentity that is beyond Being, transcending all physical reality, very\nlittle can actually be said, except that it is absolute\nUnity. However, we know empirically of its effect, the entire\nuniverse, and we must therefore suppose that the One is the carrier\nof, or rather identical with, a boundless sort of singular activity or\nenergy. Since it is counterintuitive to suppose that the material\nuniverse leapt into being in its present form directly from this\nwell-spring of energy, the question arises: what precisely is the\nfirst and primary outer activity of the inner activity of the One?\n",
