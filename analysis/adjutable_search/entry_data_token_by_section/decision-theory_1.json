Utility measures of preference\n\nIn our continuing investigation of rational preferences over\nprospects, the numerical representation (or\nmeasurement) of preference orderings will become important.\nThe numerical measures in question are known as utility\nfunctions. The two main types of utility function that will play\na role are the ordinal utility function and the more\ninformation-rich interval-valued (or cardinal)\nutility function.\n",
