Grice famously defended the truth-functional account, in his\nWilliam James lectures, \u201cLogic and Conversation\u201d,\ndelivered in 1967 (see Grice (1989); see also Thomson (1990)). There\nare many ways of speaking the truth yet misleading your audience,\ngiven the standard to which you are expected to conform in\nconversational exchange. One way is to say something weaker than some\nother relevant thing you are in a position to say. Consider\ndisjunctions. I am asked where John is. I am sure that he is in the\npub, and know that he never goes near libraries. Inclined to be\nunhelpful but not wishing to lie, I say \u201cHe is either in the pub\nor in the library\u201d. My hearer naturally assumes that this is the\nmost precise information I am in a position to give, and also\nconcludes from the truth (let us assume) that I told him \u201cIf\nhe\u2019s not in the pub he\u2019s in the library\u201d. The\nconditional, like the disjunction, according to Grice, is true if\nhe\u2019s in the pub, but misleadingly asserted on that ground. \n\nAnother example, from David Lewis (1976, p. 143): \u201cYou\nwon\u2019t eat those and live\u201d, I say of some wholesome and\ndelicious mushrooms\u2014knowing that you will now leave them alone,\ndeferring to my expertise. I told no lie\u2014for indeed you\ndon\u2019t eat them\u2014but of course I misled you.\n\nGrice drew attention, then, to situations in which a person is\njustified in believing a proposition, which would\nnevertheless be an unreasonable thing for the person to say,\nin normal circumstances. His lesson was salutary and important. He is\nright, I think, about disjunctions and negated conjunctions. Believing\nthat John is in the pub, I can\u2019t consistently\ndisbelieve \u201cHe\u2019s either in the pub or the\nlibrary\u201d; if I have any epistemic attitude to this proposition,\nit should be one of belief, however inappropriate for me to assert it.\nSimilarly for \u201cYou won\u2019t eat those and live\u201d when I\nknow you won\u2019t eat them. But it is implausible that the\ndifficulties with the truth-functional conditional can be explained\naway in terms of what is an inappropriate conversational remark. They\narise at the level of belief. Thinking that John is in the pub, I may\nwithout irrationality disbelieve \u201cIf he\u2019s not in the pub\nhe\u2019s in the library\u201d. Thinking you won\u2019t eat the\nmushrooms, I may without irrationality reject \u201cIf you eat them\nyou will die\u201d. As facts about the norms to which people defer,\nthese claims can be tested. A good enough test is to take a\nco-operative person, who understands that you are merely interested in\nher opinions about the propositions you put to her, as opposed to what\nwould be a reasonable remark to make, and note which conditionals she\nassents to. Are we really to brand as illogical someone who dissents\nfrom both \u201cThe Republicans will win\u201d and \u201cIf the\nRepublicans win, income tax will double\u201d?\n\nThe Gricean phenomenon is a real one. On anyone\u2019s account of\nconditionals, there will be circumstances when a conditional is\njustifiably believed, but is liable to mislead if stated. For\ninstance, I believe that the match will be cancelled, because all the\nplayers have \u2019flu. I believe that whether or not it rains, the\nmatch will be cancelled: if it rains, the match will be cancelled, and\nif it doesn\u2019t rain, the match will be cancelled. Someone asks me\nwhether the match will go ahead. I say, \u201cIf it rains, the match\nwill be cancelled\u201d. I say something I believe, but I mislead my\naudience \u2014 why should I say that, when I think it will be\ncancelled whether or not it rains? This does not demonstrate that Hook\nis correct. Although I believe that the match will be cancelled, I\ndon\u2019t believe that if all the players make a very speedy\nrecovery, the match will be cancelled.\n",
