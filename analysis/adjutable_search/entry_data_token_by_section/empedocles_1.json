    "main_text": "On Nature\n2. On Nature\n\nOn Nature is a bold and ambitious work. It is addressed\nvariously to the Muse, Calliope; Empedocles\u2019 disciple,\nPausanias; and perhaps also to the wider community of Acragas (Obbink\n1993). The poem\u2019s authority stems from its appeal to the divine\nfor inspiration. Empedocles\u2019 Muse does not, however, forestall\nthe labor that the addressee must invest in being cognitively\nreceptive to the message of the work (B3 = D44; B 4 = D 47). As in\ntraditional didactic verse, Empedocles cultivates a\n\u201cmaster-pupil\u201d relationship and promises Pausanias a\nmortal intelligence to soar beyond all others (B 2 = D 42). On\nNature contains an ontology of matter, barring complete\ndestruction or generation, and a cosmogony, motivated by the\naggregation and separation of Empedocles\u2019 four basic elements\nthrough the power of Love and Strife. Following this, the poem passes\nto zoogony and biology, as well as reflections on cognition and\nperception.\n",
