    "main_text": "\n\n\nHeidegger is against the modern tradition of philosophical\n\u201caesthetics\u201d because he is for the true \u201cwork of\nart\u201d which, he argues, the aesthetic approach to art eclipses.\nHeidegger\u2019s critique of aesthetics and his advocacy of art\nthus form a complementary whole. Section 1 orients the reader by\nproviding a brief overview of Heidegger\u2019s philosophical stand\nagainst aesthetics, for art. Section 2 explains\nHeidegger\u2019s philosophical critique of aesthetics, showing why he\nthinks aesthetics follows from modern \u201csubjectivism\u201d and\nleads to late-modern \u201cenframing,\u201d historical worldviews\nHeidegger seeks to transcend from within\u2014in part by way of his\nphenomenological interpretations of art. Section 3 clarifies this\nattempt to transcend modern aesthetics from within, focusing on the way\nHeidegger seeks to build a phenomenological bridge from a particular\n(\u201contic\u201d) work of art by Vincent van Gogh to the\nontological truth of art in general. In this way, as we will see,\nHeidegger seeks to show how art can help lead us into a genuinely\nmeaningful postmodern age. Section 4 concludes by explaining how\nthis understanding of Heidegger\u2019s project allows us to resolve\nthe longstanding controversy surrounding his interpretation of Van\nGogh.\n",
