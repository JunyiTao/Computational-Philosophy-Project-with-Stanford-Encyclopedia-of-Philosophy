    "main_text": "Brief Biography\n1. Brief Biography\n\nC.I. Lewis was born on April 12, 1883 in Stoneham, Massachusetts and\ndied on February 2, 1964 in Menlo Park, California. He was an\nundergraduate at Harvard from 1902\u20131906, where he was influenced\nprincipally by the pragmatist, William James, and the idealist, Josiah\nRoyce. Royce also supervised Lewis\u2019s 1910 Harvard Ph.D.\ndissertation \u201c The Place of Intuition in Knowledge\u201d. While\nserving as Royce\u2019s teaching assistant in logic, Lewis read\nWhitehead\u2019s and Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica,\na book he both admired and criticized. Later, while teaching at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley from 1911\u20131920, his\nprincipal research interests switched to logic. Lewis wrote a series\nof articles on symbolic logic culminating in his 1918 monograph A\nSurvey of Symbolic Logic (SSL) (Lewis 1918) in which he both\nsurveyed developments in symbolic logic from Leibniz up to his own day\nand presented his own modal system of strict implication. However, in\nresponse to criticism of his account of strict implication, Lewis\ndeleted these sections from reprints of SSL and revised his treatment\nof their topics for his co-authored 1932 book Symbolic Logic\n(SL) (Lewis and Langford 1932) \u2014 \u201cthe first comprehensive\ntreatment of systems of strict implication (or indeed of systems of\nmodal logic at all)\u201d, according to Hughes and Cresswell (1968,\n216). \n\nLewis returned to Harvard in 1920, where he taught until his\nretirement in 1953, becoming Edgar Peirce Professor of Philosophy in\n1948. At Harvard, Lewis\u2019 major research interest switched back\nto epistemology. Starting with his much reprinted 1923 article,\n\u201cA Pragmatic Conception of the A Priori\u201d (Lewis\n1923), he developed a distinctive position of his own which he labeled\n\u201cconceptual pragmatism\u201d and which he presented in a\nsystematic way in his 1929 book Mind and the World Order\n(MWO) (Lewis 1929). MWO established Lewis as a major figure on the\nAmerican philosophical scene. In the 1930s and 1940s, partly in\nresponse to the challenge of positivism, the form and focus of\nLewis\u2019 views changed, and, arguably, in subtle ways, some of the\nsubstance. In his 1946 book Analysis of Knowledge and\nValuation (AKV), based on his 1944 Carus lectures, Lewis (1946)\nprovided a systematic and carefully analytic presentation of his\nmature philosophical views. The first two thirds of the book consist\nof a thorough refinement and more precise presentation of his theory\nof meaning and of his epistemological views, and the last third\nconsists of a presentation of his theory of value.\n\nAfter retirement from Harvard, Lewis taught and lectured at a number\nof universities, including Princeton, Columbia, Indiana, Michigan\nState, and Southern California, but principally at Stanford. His 1954\nWoodbridge Lectures at Columbia and 1956 Mahlon Powell Lectures at\nIndiana resulted in two last short books in ethics, The Ground and\nthe Nature of the Right (Lewis 1955) and Our Social\nInheritance (Lewis 1957). Lewis was the subject of a posthumously\npublished \u201cLibrary of Living Philosophers\u201d volume (Schilpp\n1968) in which, unfortunately, his replies to critics were limited by\nillness, but which, nonetheless, was an honour that indicates his\nstanding in and perceived significance for American philosophy in the\n1950s. \n\nIn his over thirty years at Harvard, Lewis taught some of the most\neminent American philosophers of the last half of the twentieth\ncentury as graduate students, including W.V. Quine, Nelson Goodman,\nRoderick Chisholm, Roderick Firth, and Wilfrid Sellars. Although only\nChisholm and Firth of these five were supervised by Lewis, and Sellars\nleft Harvard without graduating, all five refer occasionally to Lewis\nin their writings, usually critically, and their own views sometimes\ndeveloped in reaction to his. (Baldwin 2007 has an excellent\ndiscussion of the influence of Lewis on Quine, and of Lewis\u2019s\nphilosophy generally.)\n",
