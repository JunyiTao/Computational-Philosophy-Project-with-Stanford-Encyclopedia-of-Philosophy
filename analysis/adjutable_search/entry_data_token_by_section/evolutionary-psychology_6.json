    "main_text": "Human Nature\n7. Applications of Evolutionary Psychology and Prospects for Further Debate\n\nEvolutionary psychology is invoked in a wide range of areas of study,\nfor example, in English Literature, Consumer Studies and Law. (See\nBuss 2005 for discussion of Literature and Law and Saad 2007 for a\ndetailed presentation of evolutionary psychology and consumer\nstudies.) In these contexts, evolutionary psychology is usually\nintroduced as providing resources for practitioners, which will\nadvance the relevant field. Philosophers have responded critically to\nsome of these applications of evolutionary psychology. One concern is\nthat often evolutionary psychology is conflated with evolution or\nevolutionary theory in general (see e.g. Leiter and Weisberg 2009 and\nDownes 2013). The discussion reviewed in Section 4. above, reveals a\ngood deal of disagreement between evolutionary theorists and\nevolutionary psychologists over the proper account of evolution.\nEvolutionary psychologists offer to enhance fields such as Law and\nConsumer Studies by introducing evolutionary ideas but what is in fact\noffered is a selection of theoretical resources championed only by\nproponents of a specific approach to evolutionary psychology. For\nexample, Gad Saad (2007) argues that Consumer Studies will profit\ngreatly from the addition of adaptive thinking, i.e. looking for\napparent design, and by introducing hypothetical evolved modules to\naccount for consumer behavior. Many do not see this as an effort to\nbring evolutionary theory, broadly construed, to bear on Consumer\nStudies (cf. Downes 2013). Promoting disputed theoretical ideas is\ncertainly problematic but bigger worries arise when thoroughly\ndiscredited work is promoted in the effort to apply evolutionary\npsychology. Owen Jones (see e.g. 2000; 2005), who believes that Law\nwill benefit from the application of evolutionary psychology,\nchampions Randy Thornhill and Craig Palmer\u2019s (2000) widely\ndiscredited view that rape is an adaptation as exemplary evolutionary\nwork (see de Waal 2000, Coyne and Berry 2000, Coyne 2003, Lloyd 2003,\nVickers and Kitcher 2003, and Kimmel 2003). Further, Jones (2000)\nclaims that the critics of Thornhill and Palmer\u2019s work have no\ncredibility as scientists and evolutionary theorists. This claim\nindicates Jones\u2019 serious disconnect with the wider scientific\n(and philosophical) literature on evolutionary theory (cf. Leiter and\nWeisberg 2009).\n\nAside from monitoring the expansion efforts of evolutionary\npsychology, there are a number of other areas in which further\nphilosophical work on evolutionary psychology will be fruitful. The\nexamples given above of work in moral psychology barely scratch the\nsurface of this rapidly developing field. There are huge numbers of\nempirical hypotheses that bear on our conception of our moral\npsychology that demand philosophical scrutiny. (Hauser 2006 includes a\nsurvey of a wide range of such hypotheses.) Also, work on moral\npsychology and the emotions can be drawn together via work on\nevolutionary psychology and related fields. Griffiths (1997) directed\nphilosophical attention to evolution and the emotions and this kind of\nwork has been brought into closer contact with moral psychology by\nNichols (see e.g. his 2004). In philosophy of mind there is still much\nthat can be done on the topic of modules. Work on integrating\nbiological and psychological concepts of modules is one avenue that is\nbeing pursued and could be fruitfully pursued further (see e.g.\nBarrett and Kurzban 2006; Carruthers 2006) and work on connecting\nbiology to psychology via genetics is another promising area (see e.g.\nMarcus 2004). In philosophy of science, I have no doubt that many more\ncriticisms of evolutionary psychology will be presented but a\nrelatively underdeveloped area of philosophical research is on the\nrelations among all of the various, theoretically different,\napproaches to the biology of human behavior (cf. Downes 2005;\nGriffiths 2008; and Brown et al. 2011). Evolutionary psychologists\npresent their work alongside the work of behavioral ecologists,\ndevelopmental psychobiologists and others (see e.g. Buss 2005; Buss\n2007) but do not adequately confront the theoretical difficulties that\nface an integrated enterprise in the biology of human behavior.\nFinally, while debate rages between biologically influenced and other\nsocial scientists, most philosophers have not paid much attention to\npotential integration of evolutionary psychology into the broader\ninterdisciplinary study of society and culture (but see Mallon and\nStich 2000 on evolutionary psychology and constructivism). In\ncontrast, feminist philosophers have paid attention to this\nintegration issue as well as offered feminist critiques of\nevolutionary psychology (see Fehr 2012, Meynell 2012 and the entry on\n feminist philosophy of biology).\n Gillian Barker (2015), shares some evolutionarily based criticisms of\nevolutionary psychology with philosophers of biology discussed in\nSection 4. but also assesses evolutionary psychology in relation to\nother social sciences. She also adds a novel critical appraisal of\nevolutionary psychology. She argues that, as currently practiced,\nevolutionary psychology is not a fruitful guide to social policy\nregarding human flourishing.\n\nThe publication of Shackleford and Weekes-Shackleford\u2019s (2017)\nhuge collection of articles on issues arising in the evolutionary\npsychological sciences provides a great resource for philosophers\nlooking for material to fuel critical discussion. Many evolutionary\npsychologists are aware of the difficulty variation presents for some\nestablished approaches in their field. This issue confronts those\ninterested in developing accounts of human nature, as noted above\n(Section 6.), but also arises when confronting many of the varying\nhuman behaviors evolutionary psychologists seek to account for. For\nexample, human aggression varies along many dimensions and\nconfronting and accounting for each of these types of variation is a\nchallenge for many evolutionary psychologists (cf. Downes and Tabery\n2017). Given that evolutionary psychology is just one, among many,\nevolutionarily based approaches to explaining human behavior, the most\npromising critical discussions of evolutionary psychology should\ncontinue to come from work that compares hypotheses drawn from\nevolutionary psychology with hypotheses drawn from other evolutionary\napproaches and other approaches in the social sciences more broadly\nconstrued. Stephan Linquist (2016) takes this approach to evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019 work on cultures of honor. Linquist introduces\nhypotheses from cultural evolution that appear to offer more\nexplanatory bite than those from evolutionary psychology. The broader\nissue of tension between evolutionary psychology and cultural\nevolution here will doubtless continue to attract the critical\nattention of philosophers (See Lewens 2015 for a nice clear\nintroduction to and discussion of alternative approaches to cultural\nevolution.).\n\nFinally, philosophers of science will doubtless continue to check the\ncredentials of evolutionary ideas imported into other areas of\nphilosophy. Philosophers of biology in particular, still voice\nsuspicion if philosophers borrow their evolutionary ideas from\nevolutionary psychology rather than evolutionary biology. Philip\nKitcher (2017) voices this concern with regards to Sharon\nStreet\u2019s (2006) appeals to evolution. Kitcher worries that\nStreet does not rely on \u201cwhat is known about human\nevolution\u201d (2017, 187) to provide an account of how her traits\nof interest may have emerged. As noted above, Machery\u2019s nomological notion of human nature (2008; 2017) is\ncriticized on the grounds that he takes his idea of an evolved trait\nfrom evolutionary psychology as opposed to evolutionary biology.\nBarker (2015) also encourages philosophers, as well as social\nscientists, to draw from the huge range of theoretical resources\nevolutionary biologists have to offer, rather than just from those\nprovided by evolutionary psychologists.\n",
