    "main_text": "The Analytic-Synthetic Distinction and the Argument Against Logical Empiricism\n3. The Analytic-Synthetic Distinction and the Argument Against Logical Empiricism\n\nThe philosophers who most influenced Quine were the Logical\nEmpiricists (also known as Logical Positivists), especially Rudolf\nCarnap. The distinction between analytic truths and synthetic truths\nplays a crucial role in their philosophy. Analytic truths might be\ncharacterized as those true solely in virtue of the meanings of the\nwords they contain, or of the rules of the language, or something of\nthe sort. Synthetic truths, by contrast, state matters of\nextra-linguistic fact, and are known by experience. The Logical\nEmpiricists accounted for truths which do not seem to be answerable to\nexperience, most obviously the truths of logic and mathematics, by\nsaying that they are analytic. This position was very widely held by\nthe 1940s. Quine, however, famously casts doubt on analytic-synthetic\ndistinction, and rejects the use made of it by the Logical Empiricists\nand other philosophers from the 1930s on. (Notable among the others is\nC. I. Lewis, first a teacher and then a colleague of Quine; his\ninfluence on Quine has perhaps been underestimated. See Baldwin 2013,\nBen-Menahem 2016, and Sinclair 2016.)\n\nThe issues here are complex, and the argument takes many twists and\nturns. The aim of this section is to give an account of Quine\u2019s\nmature view, and of the strongest arguments that he has for it.\n",
