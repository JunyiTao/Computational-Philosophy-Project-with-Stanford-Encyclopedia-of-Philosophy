But his philosophical agenda becomes more\ntransparent when, at 386e\u2013390e, he uses the result that\nProtagorean relativism is false to show against Hermogenes that there\nis a natural correctness of names. The argument he presents for this\nhighly significant interim conclusion is analogical in nature: It\ncompares names to tools such as knives or drills to establish that\nthey are subject to a natural standard and need to be introduced by an\nexpert. This section takes a closer look at this major turning point\nof Socrates\u2019 investigation.\n",
