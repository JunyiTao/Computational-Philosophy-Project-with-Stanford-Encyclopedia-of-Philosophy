    "main_text": "Common Presuppositions of Classical Indian Schools || Knowledge and Knowledge Sources\n1.1 Knowledge and Knowledge Sources\n\n\nA common failure of translators rendering the technical terms of the\nIndian epistemological schools into the technical terms, or even not so\ntechnical, of English and analytic philosophy, is ignorance of the\nlatter. For example, several words, the most common of which is\n\u2018j\u00f1\u0101na\u2019, are standardly rendered with the\nword \u2018knowledge\u2019 in English (e.g., Bhatt 1989). However, proper\nSanskrit usage allows \u201cfalse\u201d j\u00f1\u0101na, whereas\nthere is no false knowledge as the words are used in (analytic)\nEnglish. There is a deeper lesson here than that translators should\nstudy Western philosophy, the lesson, namely, that although there may\nbe false j\u00f1\u0101na\u2014let us say \u201ccognition\u201d:\nthere are true and false cognition\u2014it is commonly assumed in everyday\nspeech as well as by the Indian epistemologists (with a few exceptions,\nnotably, the second-century Buddhist N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and certain\nfollowers including \u015ar\u012bhar\u1e63a, the\neleventh-century Advaitin) that cognition is ordinarily by nature true\nor veridical. It is error and falsity that are the deviations from the\nnormal and natural. That is to say, cognition is regarded as knowledge\nas a kind of conversational default\u2014and so to translate\n\u2018j\u00f1\u0101na\u2019 as \u201cknowledge\u201d turns out\nnot to be so bad after all. When the eighth-century Advaitin\n\u015aa\u1e45kara says that from the\nperspective of spiritual knowledge (vidy\u0101) the\nknowledge we recognize in everyday speech turns out to be illusory,\nmithy\u0101-j\u00f1\u0101na,\n\u201cfalse knowledge,\u201d this is supposed to be felt as almost a\ncontradiction in terms (Brahma-s\u016btra Commentary,\npreamble).\n\n\nNow it is argued by practically everyone (save the anti-epistemology\ngroup headed by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna) that at least everyday knowledge\nis proved by our unhesitating action\n(ni\u1e63kampa-prv\u1e5btti) to\nget what we want and avoid what we want to avoid. We would not so act\nif we had doubt, guided as we are by our knowledge. Belief, which\ncognition embeds, is tied to action, and action, in turn, blunts the\nforce of skepticism, it is pointed out in several of the classical\nschools. Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101ra as well as\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and (most)\nVed\u0101nta view knowledge as inherently known to be true. Even\nNy\u0101ya, a school championing a view of knowledge as unselfconscious\nof itself as true, subscribes to the epistemological principle of\n\u201cInnocent until reasonably challenged\u201d (a slight weakening of the\n\u201cInnocent until proven guilty,\u201d as pointed out, e.g., by Matilal 1986,\n314: \u201cVerbal reports \u2026 are innocent until proven guilty\u201d).\nSurprisingly (given the rancor in some exchanges across school), the\nsixth-century Ny\u0101ya philosopher Uddyotakara, who is famous for his\nattacks on Yog\u0101c\u0101ra positions, takes a similarly charitable\nattitude to be a rule applying to other philosophies: \u201cFor it is a rule\nwith systems (of philosophy) that a position of another that is not\nexpressly disproved is (to be regarded as) in conformity (with one\u2019s\nown)\u201d (under Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.4:\n125).\n\n\nKnowledge is cognition that has been produced in the right way.\nCognitions are moments of consciousness, not species of belief, but we\nmay say that cognitions form beliefs in forming dispositions and that\nveridical cognitions form true beliefs. A knowledge episode\u2014to speak\nin the Indian manner\u2014is a cognition generated in the right fashion.\nWhether this be because it is (as say the realists,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, Ny\u0101ya,\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika) that it has the right\norigins in fact, or whether it is because it guides successful action\nin helping us get our desires satisfied (as say Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nidealists and pragmatists), knowledge is cognition that arises in the\nright way. There are different theories of truth, but everyone sees\nknowledge as not only revealing the truth but arising from it.\nKnowledge episodes form non-occurrent knowledge (it is assumed, we may\nsay), and so an examination of what is crucial to the arising of a\nknowledge episode is crucial to the evaluations of epistemology.\nKnowledge cannot arise by accident. A lucky guess, though true or\nveridical, would not count as knowledge because it would not been\ngenerated in the right fashion, would not have the right pedigree or\netiology. The central notion throughout classical Indian epistemology\nis the \u201cknowledge source,\u201d pram\u0101\u1e47a,\nwhich is a process of veridical-cognition generation.\n\n\nNow the word \u2018pram\u0101\u1e47a\u2019\n(\u201cknowledge source\u201d) and the result\n\u2018pram\u0101\u2019 (\u201cknowledge\u201d; this is a\ntechnical usage that matches, practically perfectly, the analytic\nusages of \u2018knowledge\u2019 in English) along with the words\nused for individual knowledge sources, for perception and so on, are\ncommonly used such that the truth of the resultant cognition is\nimplied. This runs counter to English usage, along with broad\nphilosophic supposition, which is different with the words\n\u2018perception\u2019 and company. For no knowledge source ever\ngenerates a false belief. Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhists\u2014who\nsubscribe to the metaphysical view known as momentariness, which is a\npresentism (only things existing right now are real)\u2014claim that\nthere is no difference between source and result, process of knowledge\nand effect, pram\u0101\u1e47a and\npram\u0101. Thus there can be no wedge driven between cause\nand effect such that there could possibly be true belief by accident. The\nVedic schools (M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\nVed\u0101nta, Ny\u0101ya, Vai\u015be\u1e63ika,\nS\u0101\u1e43khya, Yoga) do distinguish knowledge from\ntrue belief but also see the concepts of truth and knowledge-producing process as\nwedded in that, as indicated, no genuine knowledge source ever produces\na false belief. Only pseudo-sources do. That is to say, no\nnon-veridical cognition is knowledge-source-generated. A knowledge\nsource is then not merely a reliable doxastic practice. Being merely\nreliable does not fit the bill. The concept of a knowledge source has a\ntruth logic, like \u2018knowledge\u2019 in English; it is factive. Maybe we\nshould say perception*, inference*, testimony* to render the classical\nIndian ideas. False testimony, for example, does not count as a\nknowledge-generator; the Sanskrit word for testimony is used only for\nwhat would be termed in English \u201cepistemically successful testimony,\u201d\ni.e., with a hearer having knowledge in virtue of a speaker telling the\ntruth. A non-veridical perception is not really a perception at all but\na \u201cpseudo-perception\u201d\n(pratyak\u1e63a-\u0101bh\u0101sa),\n\u201capparent perception,\u201d a perception imitator. You don\u2019t really\nsee an illusory snake; you only think you see one.\n",
