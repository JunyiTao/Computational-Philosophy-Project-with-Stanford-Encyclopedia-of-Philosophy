The Limits of Inquiry and the Complexity of Empirical Problems\n\nAfter seeing a number of examples like the ones described above, one\nbegins to wonder what the pattern is. What is it about an empirical\nquestion that allows inquiry to reliably arrive at the correct answer?\nWhat general insights can we gain into how reliable methods go about\ntesting hypotheses? Learning theorists answer these questions with\ncharacterization theorems. Characterization theorems are\ngenerally of the form \u201cit is possible to attain this standard of\nempirical success in a given inductive problem if and only if the\ninductive problem meets the following conditions\u201d.\n\nWe first cover the case where inquiry can provide certainty as to\nwhether an empirical hypothesis is correct (relative to background\nknowledge). Then we consider when and how inquiry can converge to a\ncorrect hypothesis without ever arriving at certain conclusions, as\ndescribed in\n Section 1.\n We will introduce enough definitions and formal concepts to state the\nresults precisely; the\n supplementary document\n provides a full formalization.\n\nA learning problem is defined by a finite or countably infinite set of\npossible hypotheses \\(\\mathbf{H} = H_1, H_2 , \\ldots\n,H_n,\\ldots\\).  These hypotheses are mutually exclusive and jointly\ncover all possibilities consistent with the inquirer\u2019s\nbackground assumptions.\nExamples\n\nIn the raven color problem of\n Section 1.1,\n there are two hypotheses \\(H_1 =\\) \u201call (observed) ravens\nare black\u201d and \\(H_2 =\\) \u201csome (observed) raven is\nnot black\u201d.\nIn the New Riddle of Induction of from\n Section 1.2,\n there are infinitely many alternative hypotheses: We have\n\\(H_{green} =\\) \u201call (observed) emeralds are green\u201d\nand countably many alternatives of the form \\(H_t =\\) \u201call\n(observed) emeralds are grue\\((t)\\)\u201d where \\(t\\) is a\nnatural number.\n This section defines properties of hypotheses that determine in\nwhich sense inquiry from observations can indicate whether they are\ncorrect. These properties are not absolute but relative to a set of\nalternatives \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), any one of which may obtain for all the\ninquirer knows. The most basic relative property is relative \nentailment.\n\n\nA hypothesis \\(H\\) is consistent with a finite number of\nobservations if \\(H\\) is correct for some complete data sequence\nthat extends the finite observations.\nA finite number of observations falsifies hypothesis\n\\(H\\) if \\(H\\) is inconsistent with the observations.\nA finite number of observations  entails hypothesis\n\\(H\\) relative to a hypothesis set \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) if \\(H\\) is the only\nhypothesis in \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) consistent with the observations.\n\n\nNote that since logical entailment does not depend on the language we\nuse to frame evidence and hypotheses, the concepts of consistency,\nentailment, and falsification do not depend on the language we use to\nframe evidence and hypotheses.\nExamples. Recall the raven scenario from\n Section 1.1\n (diagram repeated for convenience).\n\n\nFigure 1 [An extended description of figure 1 is in a supplement.]\n\n\nThe observation that the first raven is black is consistent with both\nhypotheses \\(H_1 =\\) \u201call (observed) ravens are\nblack\u201d and \\(H_2 =\\) \u201csome (observed) raven is not\nblack\u201d. The observation that the first raven, or any raven, is\nwhite falsifies the hypothesis \\(H_1\\) and entails the\nhypothesis \\(H_2\\). The entailment is illustrated by the gray\nfan structure, which means that after the observation of any white\nraven, the hypothesis \\(H_1\\) is correct for any extending\ncomplete data sequence that records the color of all further observed\nravens.\n",
