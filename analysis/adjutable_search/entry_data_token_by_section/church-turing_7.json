    "main_text": "The 1936 Thesis and its Context || The Entscheidungsproblem\n1.7 The Entscheidungsproblem\n\nBoth Turing and Church introduced their respective versions of the\nChurch-Turing thesis in the course of attacking the so-called\nEntscheidungsproblem. As already mentioned, the title of\nTuring\u2019s 1936 paper included \u201cwith an Application to the\nEntscheidungsproblem\u201d, and Church went with simply \u201cA Note\non the Entscheidungsproblem\u201d for the title of his 1936 paper.\nSo\u2014what is the Entscheidungsproblem?\n\nThe German word \u201cEntscheidungsproblem\u201d means decision\nproblem. The Entscheidungsproblem for a logical calculus is the\nproblem of devising an effective method for deciding whether or not a\ngiven formula\u2014any formula\u2014is provable in the calculus.\n(Here \u201cprovable\u201d means that the formula can be derived,\nstep by logical step, from the axioms and definitions of the calculus,\nusing only the rules of the calculus.) For example, if such a method\nfor the classical propositional calculus is used to test the formula\n\\(A \\rightarrow A\\) (\\(A\\) implies \\(A\\)), the output will be\n\u201cYes, provable\u201d, and if the contradiction \\(A \\amp \\neg\nA\\) is tested, the output will be \u201cNot provable\u201d. Such a\nmethod is called a decision method or decision\nprocedure.\n\nChurch and Turing took on the Entscheidungsproblem for a fundamentally\nimportant logical system called the (first-order) functional\ncalculus. The functional calculus consists of standard\npropositional logic plus standard quantifier logic. The functional\ncalculus is also known as the classical predicate calculus\nand as quantification theory (and Church sometimes used the\nGerman term engere Funktionenkalk\u00fcl). They each arrived\nat the same negative result, arguing on the basis of the Church-Turing\nthesis that, in the case of the functional calculus, the\nEntscheidungsproblem is unsolvable\u2014there can be\nno decision method for the calculus. The two discovered this\nresult independently of one another, both publishing it in 1936\n(Church a few months earlier than Turing). Church\u2019s proof, which\nmade no reference to computing machines, is for that reason sometimes\nconsidered to be of less interest than Turing\u2019s.\n\nThe Entscheidungsproblem had attracted some of the finest minds of\nearly twentieth-century mathematical logic, including G\u00f6del,\nHerbrand, Post, Ramsey, and Hilbert and his assistants Ackermann,\nBehmann, Bernays, and Sch\u00f6nfinkel. Herbrand described the\nEntscheidungsproblem as \u201cthe most general problem of\nmathematics\u201d (Herbrand 1931b: 187). But it was Hilbert who had\nbrought the Entscheidungsproblem for the functional calculus into the\nlimelight. In 1928, he and Ackermann called it \u201cdas Hauptproblem\nder mathematischen Logik\u201d\u2014\u201cthe main problem of\nmathematical logic\u201d (Hilbert & Ackermann 1928: 77).\n\nHilbert knew that the propositional calculus (which is a fragment of\nthe functional calculus) is decidable, having found with Bernays a\ndecision procedure based on what are called \u201cnormal forms\u201d\n(Bernays 1918; Behmann 1922; Hilbert & Ackermann 1928: 9\u201312;\nZach 1999), and he also knew from the work of L\u00f6wenheim that the\nmonadic functional calculus is decidable (L\u00f6wenheim\n1915). (The monadic functional calculus is the fragment involving only\none-place predicates\u2014i.e., no relations, such as \u201c=\u201d\nand \u201c<\u201d, and no higher-place predicates, such as\n\u201c\u2013 is between \u2013 and \u2013\u201d.) He thought\nthere must be a decision procedure for the entire functional calculus.\nThe challenge, the main problem of mathematical logic, was to find it.\nAs he and Ackermann wrote in 1928, in their famous book\nGrundz\u00fcge der Theoretischen Logik (Principles of\nMathematical Logic):\n\n\n[I]t is to be expected that a systematic, so to speak computational\ntreatment of the logical formulae is possible \u2026. (Hilbert &\nAckermann 1928: 72)\n\n\nHowever, their expectations were frustrated by the Church-Turing\nresult of 1936. Hilbert and Ackermann excised the quoted statement\nfrom a revised edition of their book. Published in 1938, the new\nedition was considerably watered down to take account of\nTuring\u2019s and Church\u2019s monumental result.\n\nHilbert knew, of course, that some mathematical problems have\nno solution, for example the problem of finding a finite\nbinary numeral \\(n\\) (or unary numeral, in Hilbert\u2019s version of\nthe problem) such that \\(n^2 = 2\\) (Hilbert 1926: 179). He was\nnevertheless very fond of saying that every mathematical problem\ncan be solved, and by this he meant that\n\n\nevery definite mathematical problem must necessarily be susceptible of\nan exact settlement, either in the form of an actual answer to the\nquestion asked, or by the proof of the impossibility of its solution\nand therewith the necessary failure of all attempts. (Hilbert 1900:\n261 [trans. 1902: 444])\n\n\nIt seems never to have crossed his mind that his \u201cHauptproblem\nder mathematischen Logik\u201d falls into the second of these two\ncategories\u2014until, that is, Church and Turing unexpectedly proved\n\u201cthe impossibility of its solution\u201d.\n\nFor more detail on the Entscheidungsproblem, and an outline of the\nstunning result that Church and Turing independently established in\n1936, see the\n Supplement on the Rise and Fall of the Entscheidungsproblem.\n",
