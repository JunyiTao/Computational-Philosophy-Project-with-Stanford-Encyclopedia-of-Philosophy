The Analysis of Constraints: Their Types and Their Sources\n\nTo illustrate the range of interpretations of the concept of freedom\nmade available by MacCallum\u2019s analysis, let us now take a closer\nlook at his second variable \u2014 that of constraints on\nfreedom.\n\nAdvocates of negative conceptions of freedom typically restrict the\nrange of obstacles that count as constraints on freedom to those that\nare brought about by other agents. For theorists who conceive of\nconstraints on freedom in this way, I am unfree only to the extent\nthat other people prevent me from doing certain things. If I\nam incapacitated by natural causes \u2014 by a genetic handicap, say,\nor by a virus or by certain climatic conditions \u2014 I may be\nrendered unable to do certain things, but I am not, for that\nreason, rendered unfree to do them. Thus, if you lock me in\nmy house, I shall be both unable and unfree to leave. But if I am\nunable to leave because I suffer from a debilitating illness or\nbecause a snow drift has blocked my exit, I am nevertheless not\nunfree, to leave. The reason such theorists give, for restricting the\nset of relevant preventing conditions in this way, is that they see\nunfreedom as a social relation \u2014 a relation between\npersons (see Oppenheim 1961; Miller 1983; Steiner 1983;\nKristj\u00e1nsson 1996; Kramer 2003; Morriss 2012; Shnayderman 2013;\nSchmidt 2016). Unfreedom as mere inability is thought by such authors\nto be more the concern of engineers and medics than of political and\nsocial philosophers. (If I suffer from a natural or self-inflicted\ninability to do something, should we to say that I remain\nfree to do it, or should we say that the inability removes my\nfreedom to do it while nevertheless not implying that I am\nunfree to do it? In the latter case, we shall be endorsing a\n\u2018trivalent\u2019 conception, according to which there are some\nthings that a person is neither free nor unfree to do. Kramer 2003\nendorses a trivalent conception according to which freedom is\nidentified with ability and unfreedom is the prevention (by others) of\noutcomes that the agent would otherwise be able to bring about.)\n\nIn attempting to distinguish between natural and social obstacles we\nshall inevitably come across gray areas. An important example is that\nof obstacles created by impersonal economic forces. Do economic\nconstraints like recession, poverty and unemployment merely\nincapacitate people, or do they also render them unfree? Libertarians\nand egalitarians have provided contrasting answers to this question by\nappealing to different conceptions of constraints. Thus, one way of\nanswering the question is by taking an even more restrictive view of\nwhat counts as a constraint on freedom, so that only a subset of the\nset of obstacles brought about by other persons counts as a\nrestriction of freedom: those brought about intentionally. In\nthis case, impersonal economic forces, being brought about\nunintentionally, do not restrict people\u2019s freedom, even\nthough they undoubtedly make many people unable to do many\nthings. This last view has been taken by a number of market-oriented\nlibertarians, including, most famously, Friedrich von Hayek (1960,\n1982), according to whom freedom is the absence of coercion, where to\nbe coerced is to be subject to the arbitrary will of another. (Notice\nthe somewhat surprising similarity between this conception of freedom\nand the republican conception discussed earlier, in section 3.2)\nCritics of libertarianism, on the other hand, typically endorse a\nbroader conception of constraints on freedom that includes not only\nintentionally imposed obstacles but also unintended obstacles for\nwhich someone may nevertheless be held responsible (for Miller and\nKristj\u00e1nsson and Shnayderman this means morally\nresponsible; for Oppenheim and Kramer it means causally\nresponsible), or indeed obstacles created in any way whatsoever, so\nthat unfreedom comes to be identical to inability (see Crocker 1980;\nCohen 2011, pp. 193\u201397; Sen 1992; Van Parijs 1995; Garnett forthcoming).\n\nThis analysis of constraints helps to explain why socialists and\negalitarians have tended to claim that the poor in a capitalist\nsociety are as such unfree, or that they are less free than the rich,\nwhereas libertarians have tended to claim that the poor in a\ncapitalist society are no less free than the rich. Egalitarians\ntypically (though do not always) assume a broader notion than\nlibertarians of what counts as a constraint on freedom. Although this\nview does not necessarily imply what Berlin would call a positive\nnotion of freedom, egalitarians often call their own definition a\npositive one, in order to convey the sense that freedom requires not\nmerely the absence of certain social relations of prevention but the\npresence of abilities, or what Amartya Sen has influentially called\n\u2018capabilities\u2019 (Sen 1985, 1988, 1992; Nussbaum 2006,\n2011). (Important exceptions to this egalitarian tendency to broaden\nthe relevant set of constraints include those who consider poverty to\nindicate a lack of social freedom (see sec. 3.1, above). Steiner\n(1994), grounds a left-libertarian theory of justice in the idea of an\nequal distribution of social freedom, which he takes to imply an equal\ndistribution of resources.)\n\nWe have seen that advocates of a negative conception of freedom tend\nto count only obstacles that are external to the agent. Notice,\nhowever, that the term \u2018external\u2019 is ambiguous in this\ncontext, for it might be taken to refer either to the location of the\ncausal source of an obstacle or to the location of the obstacle\nitself. Obstacles that count as \u2018internal\u2019 in terms of\ntheir own location include psychological phenomena such as ignorance,\nirrational desires, illusions and phobias. Such constraints can be\ncaused in various ways: for example, they might have a genetic origin,\nor they might be brought about intentionally by others, as in the case\nof brainwashing or manipulation. In the first case we have an internal\nconstraint brought about by natural causes, and in this sense\n\u2018internally\u2019; in the second, an internal constraint\nintentionally imposed by another human agent, and in this sense\n\u2018externally\u2019.\n\nMore generally, we can now see that there are in fact two different\ndimensions along which one\u2019s notion of a constraint might be\nbroader or narrower. A first dimension is that of the source\nof a constraint \u2014 in other words, what it is that brings about a\nconstraint on freedom. We have seen, for example, that some theorists\ninclude as constraints on freedom only obstacles brought about by\nhuman action, whereas others also include obstacles with a natural\norigin. A second dimension is that of the type of constraint\ninvolved, where constraint-types include the types of internal\nconstraint just mentioned, but also various types of constraint\nlocated outside the agent, such as physical barriers that render an\naction impossible, obstacles that render the performance of an action\nmore or less difficult, and costs attached to the performance of a\n(more or less difficult) action. The two dimensions of type and source\nare logically independent of one another. Given this independence, it\nis theoretically possible to combine a narrow view of what counts as a\nsource of a constraint with a broad view of what types of obstacle\ncount as unfreedom-generating constraints, or vice versa. As\na result, it is not clear that theorists who are normally placed in\nthe \u2018negative\u2019 camp need deny the existence of internal\nconstraints on freedom (see Kramer 2003; Garnett 2007).\n\nTo illustrate the independence of the two dimensions of type and\nsource, consider the case of the unorthodox libertarian Hillel Steiner\n(1974\u20135, 1994). On the one hand, Steiner has a much\nbroader view than Hayek of the possible sources of\nconstraints on freedom: he does not limit the set of such sources to\nintentional human actions, but extends it to cover all kinds of human\ncause, whether or not any humans intend such causes and whether or not\nthey can be held morally accountable for them, believing that any\nrestriction of such non-natural sources can only be an arbitrary\nstipulation, usually arising from some more or less conscious\nideological bias. On the other hand, Steiner has an even\nnarrower view than Hayek about what type of obstacle\ncounts as a constraint on freedom: for Steiner, an agent only counts\nas unfree to do something if it is physically impossible for\nher to do that thing. Any extension of the constraint variable to\ninclude other types of obstacle, such as the costs anticipated in\ncoercive threats, would, in his view, necessarily involve a reference\nto the agent\u2019s desires, and we have seen (in sec. 2) that for\nthose liberals in the negative camp there is no necessary relation\nbetween an agent\u2019s freedom and her desires. Consider the\ncoercive threat \u2018Your money or your life!\u2019. This does not\nmake it impossible for you to refuse to hand over your money, only\nmuch less desirable for you to do so. If you decide not to hand over\nthe money, you will suffer the cost of being killed. That\nwill count as a restriction of your freedom, because it will\nrender physically impossible a great number of actions on your part.\nBut it is not the issuing of the threat that creates this unfreedom,\nand you are not unfree until the sanction (described in the threat) is\ncarried out. For this reason, Steiner excludes threats \u2014 and\nwith them all other kinds of imposed costs \u2014 from the set of\nobstacles that count as freedom-restricting. This conception of\nfreedom derives from Hobbes (Leviathan, chs. 14 and 21), and\nits defenders often call it the \u2018pure\u2019 negative conception\n(M. Taylor 1982; Steiner 1994; Carter and Kramer 2008) to distinguish\nit from those \u2018impure\u2019 negative conceptions that make at\nleast minimal references to the agent\u2019s beliefs, desires or\nvalues.\n\nSteiner\u2019s account of the relation between freedom and coercive\nthreats might be thought to have counterintuitive implications, even\nfrom the liberal point of view. Many laws that are normally thought to\nrestrict negative freedom do not physically prevent people from doing\nwhat is prohibited, but deter them from doing so by threatening\npunishment. Are we to say, then, that these laws do not restrict the\nnegative freedom of those who obey them? A solution to this problem\nmay consist in saying that although a law against doing some action,\nx, does not remove the freedom to do x, it\nnevertheless renders physically impossible certain\ncombinations of actions that include doing x and\ndoing what would be precluded by the punishment. There is a\nrestriction of the person\u2019s overall negative freedom\n\u2014 i.e. a reduction in the overall number of act-combinations\navailable to her \u2014 even though she does not lose the freedom to\ndo any specific thing taken in isolation (Carter 1999).\n",
