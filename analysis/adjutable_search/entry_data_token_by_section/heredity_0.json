    "main_text": "Terminological issues\n1. Terminological issues\n\nThe term \u201cheritable\u201d applies to traits that vary in the\npopulation and are more similar in parents and offspring than they are\nin randomly selected individuals in the population. We inherit\nnumerous attributes from our parents including their religious beliefs\nand, if we are lucky, their vast fortunes. The kinds of hereditary\ntraits that biologists are interested in are those that are reliably\ntransmitted from one generation to the next as a matter of\nbiology. Darwin (1859 [1968]), working without the advantages that\ngenetics would later bring, discussed hereditary traits at the level\nof phenotypes. Darwin demonstrated that natural selection sorts among\nhereditary variations, for example, the height of an organism, its\nweight, the color of its coat and so on. Most contemporary discussions\nof heredity constrain hereditary traits to those that can be\ndemonstrated to be passed on genetically. The concept of\n\u201cheritability\u201d was introduced \u201cto quantify the level\nof predictability of passage of a biologically interesting phenotype\nfrom parent to offspring\u201d (Feldman, 151). Heritability is\nusually assessed by complex statistical analysis, careful\nexperimentation or both.\n\nDiscussions of heredity invite confusions between mechanisms\nresponsible for individual development and mechanisms responsible for\nthe transmission of traits from one generation to the next. Genes are\nthe standard units of inheritance discussed in biology. Genes are also\ntaken to be the most important causal component in the development of\nan organism\u2019s traits. Methods derived from population genetics\nto assess heritability provide no information about the causal\nmechanisms contributing to the development of an individual\u2019s\ntraits. Population geneticists study the patterns of transmission of\ntraits in populations from one generation to the next. Molecular\nbiologists identify coding sequences of DNA and hence the proteins\nthat these sequences produce in the developing organism. Working\ntogether, molecular biologists and population geneticists can produce\na convergent account of a particular gene, providing both its pattern\nof transmission and an account of its role in development. For\nexample, medical geneticists may discover a pattern of inheritance for\na disease in a family that leads them to hypothesize that there is a\ngene (or a number of genes) responsible for the development of the\ntrait in individual humans. Molecular analysis may then lead to the\ndiscovery of a sequence of DNA that codes for an unusual protein that\nis in part responsible for the development of the symptoms of the\ndisease. Finally, population genetics techniques, such as heritability\nanalysis, may then be applied to mechanisms discovered by molecular\nbiologists.\n",
