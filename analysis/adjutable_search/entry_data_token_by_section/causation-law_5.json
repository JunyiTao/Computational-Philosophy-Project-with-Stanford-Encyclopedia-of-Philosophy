    "main_text": "The Value(s) Served by Causal Requirements in the Law of Torts and of Crimes\n4. The Value(s) Served by Causal Requirements in the Law of Torts and of Crimes\n\nThere are two reasons to care about the rationale for the law\u2019s\nuse of causation in the liability doctrines of tort and criminal law.\nThe less relevant one here is the legal reformer\u2019s motive, which\nis to assess what the best test for causation is and to recommend that\nsuch a test ought to be legislated for future legal use. The\nsecond, and the more relevant motive here, is the lawyer\u2019s\nmotive, which is to understand what the requirement for causation\npresently is under existing law. As was previewed in\n section 1,\n what the law provides on a given topic like causation is in part\nconstituted by the function such a requirement serves in a body of\nlaw, and such function thus constitutes the third ingredient we need\nto consult as we reconstruct the law\u2019s concept of causation.\n\nLawyers and legal theorists alike have an unfortunate penchant for\nproclaiming that the law is, should be, and must be,\nautonomous from other disciplines (such as philosophy) in its\nuse of concept like causation (Stapleton 2008; 2015). As Sir Frederick\nPollack put it over a century ago, \u201cthe lawyer cannot afford to\nadventure himself with philosophers in the logical and metaphysical controversies that beset the idea of\ncause\u201d (1901: 36). Yet whether such conceptual autonomy is\ndesirable, necessary, or even possible, presupposes that the law has\npurposes for its causal requirements that do not dovetail with the\nmetaphysics of causation so studied by philosophy.\n\nAs we will see below in\n section 5.2,\n the legal economists and other utilitarians believe that legal rules\nattaching liability to those who cause harm, have as their\nrationale preventing sub-optimal levels of such harms; they do this by\nincentivizing future behavior by the placement of liability (or\nrewards) on past behavior. On such a view, causation in the law might\nwell mean something different than it means when used in ordinary or\nscientific discourse\u2014for to gain incentive effects from\ncause-based liability rules, one might well identify\n\u201ccause\u201d with the raising of conditional probability, as\nthe legal economists have indeed often urged.\n\nAn alternative view of legal purposes, however, returns the law to the\nmetaphysics of causation. That view holds that criminal law serves the\nvalue of retributive justice just as tort law serves the value of\ncorrective justice. Retributive justice requires that those who\nculpably cause harm suffer the censure and deprivations constitutive\nof punishment; corrective justice requires that those who culpably\ncause harm to another correct that injustice by compensating that\nother. In both cases, serving such kinds of justice demands that one\nnot identify \u201ccause\u201d as used in legal liability\nrules as anything other than that with which it is identified in such\njustice theories. Because such moral theories of justice require that\nthe true metaphysics of causation determines when someone has\ncaused an injury or other harm to another, so too must the\nlaw of torts and of crimes. On such an alternative view of the\nrationale for causal requirements in the law of torts and of crimes,\nthe lawyer thus must \u201cadventure herself with the\nphilosopher\u201d on the metaphysics of causation. Those who so\nadventure themselves will not regard all the candidates for the\nlaw\u2019s concept of causation with equal favor.\n\nWhat the law of causation needs to be if it is to serve the\nvalue(s) constituting the function of the rules in which causation\nappears, thus makes a considerable difference to what the law of\ncausation is. As we proceed to describe what the law\u2019s\nconcept of causation is, we should be eclectic on what these values\nare. We shall thus regard as unsettled what most theorists regard as\nsettled (not that they agree on how it is settled), and\nconsider things not only from the perspective of those who think that\ncriminal law and torts serve the ends of retributive and corrective\njustice, but also from the perspectives of those who think that these\nareas of law serve other values (both utilitarian and otherwise), or\neven no coherent set of values at all.\n",
