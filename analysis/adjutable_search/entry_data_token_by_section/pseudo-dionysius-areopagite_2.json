    "main_text": "Outline and Content of the Works || Theological Representations\n3.1 Theological Representations\n\nAlthough the Theological Representations is not extant, we\nare able to glean its content from Dionysius\u2019 ample descriptions\nof it in his other works. It seems to have devoted itself to names for\nthe three persons within the godhead and their attributes. These names\nare the representations mentioned in the work\u2019s title. They\ndescribe two forms of differentiation within the godhead: the\ndistinction into persons, and into attributes of the persons. Names\nfor the persons include \u201cFather,\u201d \u201cSon,\u201d and\n\u201cHoly Spirit.\u201d Names for the attributes include\n\u201csource,\u201d \u201coffshoot,\u201d \u201cflower,\u201d\nand \u201clight.\u201d Dionysius does not explain why he uses the\nterm \u201crepresentation\u201d (hypotuposis) for these\nnames, but his fondness for puns may have led him to adopt it because\nof its similarity to \u201cperson\u201d (hypostasis).\n\nSome of these names describe more than a person within the godhead.\nThe name \u201cfather,\u201d for instance, may also be used of\nanimals, in which case it means the male parent. We seem to apply such\nnames literally to animals and only metaphorically to persons within\nthe godhead. But Dionysius uncovers a passage from Paul\u2019s letter\nto the Ephesians which leads him to claim otherwise. Paul says that\nGod the Father is the one \u201cfrom whom all fatherhood in the\nheavens and on earth is named.\u201d On the basis of this scriptural\nauthority, Dionysius explains that we are able to use the terms\n\u201cfather\u201d and \u201cson\u201d of animals only because the\ngodhead has already undergone the same relation. In other words, the\ninternal causality exercised within the godhead is the source of all\nother causality. This includes not only the causation of one animal by\nanother, but of one angel by another, since angels, too, receive the\nnames of \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cson.\u201d\n",
