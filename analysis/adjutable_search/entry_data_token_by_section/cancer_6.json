Cancer as a Byproduct: Evolution, Development, and Aging\n\nDobzhansky (1973) wrote that \u201cnothing in biology makes sense\nexcept in light of evolution.\u201d Can evolutionary thinking shed\nlight on cancer? After all, cancer is ordinarily understood to be a\ncase of failure of otherwise functional controls on cell birth and\ndeath. At first pass, this view seems fundamentally at odds with\ntaking an evolutionary perspective on cancer. For, how can something\nthat is an exemplary case of \u201cdysfunction\u201d count as an\nevolutionary process or product of adaptive evolution? Moreover, how\nought we to square this picture of cancer with the fact that cancer\ncells seem to co-opt developmental processes\u2014i.e., the process\nof \u201cde-differentiation\u201d typical of early embryonic cells?\nIs cancer a byproduct of development? Finally, cancer seems to\nincrease in incidence as we age. Is cancer simply a byproduct of\naging? Relatedly, if\u2014as some argue\u2014aging itself is\nselected for (a contested question!), is cancer in some sense\n\u201cadaptive\u201d? All these perspectives on cancer require us to\nperhaps rethink the nature of function and dysfunction, or at very\nleast, what such terms mean in the context of discussion of cancer.\nSome argue that there is a straightforward sense to be made of\nscientists\u2019 talk of cancer cells performing\n\u201cfunctions,\u201d insofar as they are involved in activities\nthat contribute to the self-maintenance and continued presence of the\nsystems of interest, namely cancer cells (Goldwasser, 2023,\nforthcoming). This sense of \u201cfunction\u201d is a\nnon-evolutionary, but part-function account. On the other hand, some\nargue that cancer is a product of evolutionary trade-offs in fitness\nat different temporal and spatial scales over the course of our life\nand evolutionary history. On this view, the best perspective to take\non cancer\u2019s \u201cfunctions\u201d may be a\n\u201cmultilevel\u201d evolutionary perspective\u2014i.e., thinking\nof evolution by natural selection as operating at different temporal\nand spatial scales, both sequentially, and in some cases,\nsimultaneously, sometimes yielding unfortunate \u201ccross-level\nbyproducts\u201d of selection at one temporal and spatial scale, for\nentities or processes at other temporal or spatial scales (cf. Okasha\n2006). Can such apparently contradictory accounts of cancer\u2019s\n\u201cfunctional\u201d status be reconciled?\n\nFirst, it is relatively uncontroversial that understanding a\nspecies\u2019 evolutionary history, and the selective trade-offs they\nface over the course of their life history, can inform our\nunderstanding of how and why they are more or less vulnerable to\ndisease. For instance, some species are more vulnerable to cancer than\nothers. Why? Comparative biology\u2014the comparison of different\nspecies\u2014may help us identify mechanisms associated with disease\nvulnerability, onset and progression, when they arose, where and why\nthey are shared, as well as how they have diverged (Aktipis, et al.\n2015; Aktipis, 2020). Comparing and contrasting how development,\nimmunity, and other mechanisms of suppression of cancer across species\ncan help cancer researchers identify targets of opportunity for either\ntreatment or prevention of cancer. In addition, we can look to unique\nfeatures of our own evolutionary history in order to explain patterns\nof disease incidence, suggesting selective \u201cmismatches\u201d\nwith our ancestral environment, a kind of \u201cbyproduct\u201d\nexplanations of our vulnerability to diseases. This enterprise is\nbroadly characterized as \u201cevolutionary medicine\u201d (Crespi\n& Summers 2005; Gluckman, et al. 2009; Stearns & Koella 2007;\nSun, et al. 2014).\n\nWhile the broad principles behind evolutionary medicine are relatively\nuncontroversial\u2014we all are evolved organisms after\nall\u2014philosophers of biology have been skeptical of particular\nclaims about how our evolutionary history has shaped our vulnerability\nto disease, either because evidence in support of evolutionary\n\u201cmismatch\u201d with our ancestral environment is both scant\nand disputed, or because many arguments in evolutionary medicine make\n\u201cadaptationist\u201d assumptions, i.e., assumptions that a\ngiven trait is adaptive, or selectively advantageous, founded on at\nbest \u201cjust so\u201d stories (Valles 2012; see also Murphy\n2006). Others offer more nuanced accounts of the variety of senses in\nwhich evolutionary \u2018mismatch\u2019 explanations go forward, and\nare supported by a variety of evidence (Bourrat and Griffiths\nforthcoming).\n\nOf course, there are better and worse such arguments; the best\narguments consider not only the widest array of evidence, but also\ntrade offs in fitness, as well as the role of constraints arising out\nof development and life history. Selective trade-offs are long known\nto play a causal role in disease. In the case of cancer, some have\nspeculated that traits adaptive early in life may yield fitness costs\nlater in life. A vivid example may be early rapid growth, which can\nboth increase reproductive fitness, but also apparently increase risk\nof prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women (Giles, et. al.,\n2003; Ahlgren, et. al., 2004; Summers, et al., 2008; Alvarado, 2013;\nBoddy, et. al., 2015). In contrast, \u201cmismatch\u201d hypotheses\nsuggest that traits that may have been adaptive in the past leave us\nvulnerable to disease in our current environment. For instance, many\nadvocates of evolutionary medicine have argued that the high\ncorrelation between nulliparity and cancer risk might be explained by\nour evolutionary history. The argument relies on the hypothesis that\nwomen in the evolutionary past were pregnant for much of their lives,\nstarting at an earlier age; breast development and differentiation was\nthus adapted to a lifetime of frequent pregnancy and nursing. Delaying\nor avoiding pregnancy thus changes the developmental processes typical\nfor our species, which could increase breast cancer risk. Of course,\nsuch hypotheses are contentious; there is always the potential for\nconfounding causes (in this case, of increased cancer risk due to a\nvariety of risk factors at work in modern society) (Greaves 2001).\nNonetheless, in a 1970 case-control study conducted at eight different\nlocations around the globe, a WHO group led by McMahon et al.,\nestimated that \u201cbreast cancer risk for women having their first\nbirth under the age of 20 years is about half that for nulliparous\nwomen,\u201d and that \u201cwomen having their first child when aged\nunder 18 years have only about one-third the breast cancer risk of\nthose whose first birth is delayed until the age of 35 years or\nmore.\u201d Evolutionary \u201cbyproduct\u201d explanations appeal\nto our evolutionary history to explain this observation. Both the\nabove arguments may be making speculative assumptions about the\nadaptive advantage of size or early age of sexual maturity in our\nevolutionary past. Sex differences in various aspects of cancer risk,\nmortality, and progression thus provide an interesting case study for\ndeveloping more sophisticated means of both defining and\noperationalizing sex differences in scientific research, and testing\nhypotheses about role of sex in disease (Mauvais-Jarvis, et. al.,\n2020, DiMarco, et. al., 2022)\n\nAnother type of \u201cbyproduct\u201d explanation of\ncancer\u2014though one that appeals to a much more distant event in\nour evolutionary history\u2014is that cancer is a product (or perhaps\nbyproduct, or re-enactment) of the emergence of multicellularity. At\none point in the very distant past, single celled organisms formed\ncollectives that cooperate; these collectives eventually became\nmulticellular organisms. Any collective of cells, especially\ncollectives whose survival and reproductive success depends on\nfunctional organization, are potentially vulnerable to breakdown in\ncooperative organization. On this view, then, cancer is a product of\nbreakdown in mechanisms that permitted the emergence of\nmulticellularity\u2014the mechanisms that protect us from\n\u201crevolt from within\u201d are not error-free, and over time\nwill fail. Such discussions raise interesting questions about the\nnature of individuality (For a vivid discussion, see, e.g., Okasha\n2006; Godfrey-Smith 2009; Bouchard & Huneman 2013; Clarke 2011,\n2013; Love & Brigandt 2017; Bueno, et al. 2019; Pradeu 2012, 2013,\n2016, 2019). Pradeu (2019, chapter 4) has distinguished two ways in\nwhich the immune system can contribute to cancer seen as a breakdown\nof individuality: either through a breakdown of its normal functioning\n(e.g. the immune system should eliminate cancer cells but fails to do\nso) or \u201cthe immune system acts normally and immune-mediated\ndecohesion is due to an abnormal context\u201d (e.g. the tumor\nproduces an abnormal context that stimulates an immune response such\nas healing when there is no wound to heal).\n\nAccording to some (Greaves & Maley 2012; Merlo, et al. 2006) the\nevolutionary picture of cancer dovetails nicely with the somatic\nmutation theory; somatic cells divide and acquire mutations during our\nlifetimes; some of these mutations involve failures in regulatory\npathways that ordinarily \u201cenforce\u201d functional\norganization, and thus cooperation. In this way, an evolutionary\nperspective\u2014understanding how evolution of multicellularity\nrequired the emergence of cooperative organization\u2014is essential\nto understanding cancer. Moreover, on this view, cancer itself may be\nviewed as an evolutionary process\u2014the emergence of adaptive\nfeatures of cancer cells, where these \u201cadaptations\u201d enable\nshort term \u201cfitness,\u201d or relative success at survival and\nreproduction. Several scientists have developed theoretical models of\nthis process, linking it to empirical data, e.g., on the emergence of\nchemotherapy resistance (Frank 2007; Wodarz & Komarova 2015). On\nthis view, cancer is both a process and byproduct of multi-level\nselection, where selection may be understood as operating at several\nlevels of biological organization simultaneously, or sequentially\n(Damuth & Heisler 1988; Lean & Plutynski 2016). That is,\ncancer cells may bear adaptations, and they are also evolutionary\nbyproducts of selective processes at other levels of organization. It\nappears that cancer cells co-opt or hijack otherwise adaptive features\nof organisms. Signaling pathways that are ordinarily in service of\nadaptive functions in early stages of development or wound healing are\nreactivated in (some) cancer cells, in service of the transition to\nmetastasis.\n\nThis is a classic example of a cross-level selective byproduct (Okasha\n2005, 2006). Traits advantageous at one level in the organization of\nmulticellular organisms may be coopted by component parts. Some of the\ncapacities that invasive cancer cells acquire (the capacity to invade\nand metastasize) are in fact due to a change in phenotype from\nepithelial to mesenchymal type cells, and losing adhesive properties\nenables such cells to invade the lymph and blood system. Lean and\nPlutynski (2016) have argued that cancer may in some ways parallel the\npatterns of emergence of multicellularity as characterized by Damuth\nand Heisler (1988), shifting over the course of emergence of disease\nfrom a simple selective process between individual cells to several\nkinds of multilevel selective process (MLS1 to MLS2). Critics contest\nthat the process of metastasis only weakly mimics MLS2, however\n(Germain & Laplane 2017).\n\nWhether or in what sense cancer cells are \u201cselfish\u201d or\n\u201ccheat\u201d is a topic of debate (Aktipis 2020; Okasha\nforthcoming; Pradeu et al. 2023). Critics argue that the analogy is\nmisleading, given that non-transmissible cancers are evolutionary\ndead-ends (Gardner, 2015; Shpak and Lu, 2016). Okasha (2021) argues\nthat cancer cells could be genuine case of cheaters if the atavistic\ntheory is true (which is by itself a matter of debate), i.e., if\ncancer cells revert to a unicellular mode of life that have been\nrepressed during the transition to multicellularity. To be sure, there\nare both analogies and disanalogies between evolution in whole\norganisms, and the evolving population of cancer cells in a tumor\n(Germain 2012).  However, thinking of cancer as a dynamic,\nevolutionary process, has great potential for applications in cancer\ntreatment, and perhaps also, in prevention. For instance, some have\nsuggested that we might give young girls drugs or nutritional\nsupplements that remodel the breast in ways akin to pregnancy, as a\nway to prevent the emergence of breast cancer (Katz, et\nal. 2015). Others suggest that modeling the evolution of multi-drug\nresistance may help prevent one of the major causes of cancer\nmortality. Drugs can be more or less effective in different patients\nand lose their effectiveness over time. An evolutionary perspective on\ncancer may shed light on how drug resistance comes about, in patients\nwith more or less intratumor heterogeneity (Greaves 2001, 2007; Frank\n& Nowak 2004; Merlo, et al. 2006; Greaves & Maley, 2012).\n\nA third type of byproduct explanation for cancer is the view that\ncancer is a disease of aging\u2014that is, cancer incidence by and\nlarge increases as we age, perhaps in part as a byproduct of\nbreakdowns in mechanisms associated with immune response and tissue\nintegrity. This claim raises some broader questions about how we\nassess function and dysfunction, or how we assess function at\ndifferent temporal and spatial scales of analysis, as well as how we\nunderstand the role of the immune system and the integrity of the\norganism as an individual. Indeed, all evolutionary and byproduct\nexplanations of cancer raise similar philosophical questions about\nhypothesis testing, as well as definitions of \u201cfunction\u201d\nand \u201cindividuality,\u201d both at the individual and group\nlevel, and over the course of one\u2019s life history. On the\nevolutionary view of cancer, for instance, cancer cells are in some\nsense highly adaptive (Hausman 2012; Germain 2012; Godfrey-Smith\n2009). One relatively controversial view of aging, first proposed by\nAugust Weisman, is that aging has the evolutionary\nadvantage\u2014effectively clearing the way for the young. If indeed\ncancer is a necessary byproduct of aging, and aging is selected for,\nthen on one view, cancer may be thought of as adaptive. Such a view\nraises a variety of questions about evidence and adaptationist\nexplanations.(see the entry on\n \u201cadaptationism\u201d).\n \n",
