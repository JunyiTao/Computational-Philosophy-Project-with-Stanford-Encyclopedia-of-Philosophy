    "main_text": "Additional Dance and Philosophy Connections || Non-Western and Non-Traditional Philosophy and Dance\n5.1 Non-Western and Non-Traditional Philosophy and Dance\n\nHere the reader is encouraged to consult sources that may not be\ncalled \u201cphilosophy\u201d but something else, such as religious\nstudies, ethnography, cultural anthropology, oral history, and the\nlike, particularly in those traditions where philosophy and religious\nscholarship combines (as in Islamic philosophy and some forms of East\nAsian and Indian philosophy) or where the traditions of thought are\ncommunicated orally rather than in writing (as is often the case in\nthe philosophy of native and indigenous peoples). There is also much\nof philosophy of dance interest to be found in the literature, poetry,\nand song of groups and peoples who are not a traditionally\nenfranchised part of the Western philosophical canon.\n\nThe bibliographic sources provided here on non-Western and\nnon-traditional philosophy and/or non-Western forms of dance include\nS. Davies (2006, 2008, 2012, and 2017) on Balinese Legong, Fraleigh\n(2010 and 2015) on the Japanese form of dance known as Butoh,\nincluding asking whether Butoh is a philosophy, Friedman\u2019s\nforthcoming essay on post-colonial African philosophical frameworks as\napplied to dance, Hall 2012 on Fanon\u2019s view of dance, Osumare\n2007 on Africanist aesthetics and hip-hop, Schroeder 2009 on Nietzsche\nand the Kyoto school, Welch 2019 on Native American dance and the\nphenomenology of performative knowledge, and Welsh-Asante 1990, who\nhas published a piece on Cabral, Fanon and dance in Africa. See also\n Section 5.2\n below, particularly for Western non-traditional philosophy, some of\nwhich is critical work that has been placed under the social-political\ncategory.\n",
