    "main_text": "Method\n2. Method\n\nThe first reaction of many readers is to the very style of\nGrotius\u2019 prose. So before getting to his ideas and arguments, a\nfew words should be said his method, both in the DIP and the\nDIB. There are of course differences between the two works.\nHowever, the connection between them is ably described by\nStraumann:\n\n\nAlthough De iure belli ac pacis was written under\nfundamentally different circumstances from De iure praedae,\nits main teachings... can be understood as an elaborated version of\nthe earlier work. (2015: 212)\n\n\nSo we can take the crucial aspects of the two works, which includes\ntheir methods, to be at minimum consistent and at maximum merely\ndifferent expressions of the same basic underlying set of\nconvictions.\n\nNow, as we think about the method employed in the two works, we find\nseveral distinct issues. First and most obviously, there is the\nquestion of what we should make of the voluminous references to\nancient, medieval and early modern works which can be found in the\nmargins of both books. Some have taken a rather dim view of them; in a\nscornful passage of \u00c9mile, Rousseau wrote:\n\n\nTrue political theory [le droit politique] is yet to appear,\nand it is to be presumed that it never will. Grotius, the master of\nall the savants in this subject, is but a child; and, what is worse, a\ndishonest child [enfant de mauvaise foi]. When I hear Grotius\npraised to the skies and Hobbes covered with execration I see how far\nsensible men read or understand these two authors. The truth is that\ntheir principles are exactly the same: they only differ in their\nexpression. They also differ in their method. Hobbes relies on\nsophisms, and Grotius on the poets; all the rest is the same.\n(Rousseau 1762: Bk 4 [1915: vol. II, 147])\n\n\nIt would be absurd to deny that Grotius does rely \u201con the\npoets\u201d\u2014after all, he said in the \u201cProlegomena\u201d\nto the DIB that \u201cthe testimony of philosophers,\nhistorians, poets, finally also of orators\u201d will be used to\n\u201cprove the existence of this law of nature\u201d (\u00a740).\nArguments from authority carried great weight for him: the more\nilluminati one could cite, the better for one\u2019s\nargument. Philosophers today may not be impressed by such arguments,\nthough they can be instructive to historians of philosophy. By\nstudying Grotius\u2019 use of texts, one can learn how they were\ninterpreted in the early modern period\u2014and this can unlock one\nof the many barriers to understanding that time.\n\nBut is there more to his citations of these texts than just a perhaps\noverly respectful attitude toward authority? Most scholars think there\nis, though they are divided on what it might be. One possibility is\nthat they reflect Grotius\u2019 commitment to the idea of\nphilosophia perennis. Like Leibniz a few decades later,\nGrotius thought there were elements of truth in virtually all great\nthinkers. He writes,\n\n\nI quote them as witnesses whose conspiring testimony, proceeding from\ninnumerable different times and places, must be referred to some\nuniversal cause. (DIB Prol. \u00a740)\n\n\nHis job as heir to ideas of the great dead is to combine or synthesize\nthem into a single unified theory. And doing that requires him to draw\non them as frequently as possible.\n\nAnother suggestion sees Grotius as deeply concerned to refute\nscepticism about international law. Grotius was upset when the\npowerful French Cardinal Richelieu told him, \u201cthe weakest are\nalways wrong in matters of state\u201d. How is it that he can\nconvince doubters such as Richelieu of the existence and force of a\nset of norms governing the conduct of governments both domestically\nand internationally? The argument will never be easily won but the\nburden may be lightened by sharing the load. If Grotius can show that\nso many people throughout history have accepted what the sceptic\ndenies, then perhaps the force of numbers may change the\nsceptic\u2019s mind.\n\nQuite apart from the questions posed by the marginalia, an entirely\ndifferent aspect of Grotius\u2019 method concerns his refusal to\ndivide ethics, politics and law into separate subjects. These days,\ncompartmentalization is the norm; ordinarily, we study one of these\nsubjects while paying scant attention to the others. Now, it is true\nthat Grotius does often identify ways in which legal norms differ from\nmoral or political ones (see, e.g., the discussion of laws at the\nbeginning of DIB I.1). At the same time, he does not think\nthat law, politics and ethics are entirely distinct domains. If one\nreads Grotius with the expectation that he will keep them apart, one\nwill likely be befuddled by the way he ignores distinctions which are\nimportant to us. It may help to know that he does this because he is\ninterested in picking out the fundamental principles which lie at the\nbasis of all normativity, not just a portion thereof. He\ncannot talk just about ethics, say, because his views on ethics are\ninformed by his views on politics and the law. A fundamental tenet of\nhis thought is that moral, political and legal norms are all based on\nlaws derived from or supplied by nature.\n\nThe issues here are complex and much discussed. For more, see Dufour\n(1980), Tanaka (1993), Vermeulen (1983) and Whewell (1853).\n",
