    "main_text": "\n\n\nTaken at face value, the claim that Nigel has a moral obligation to\nkeep his promise, like the claim that Nyx is a black cat, purports to\nreport a fact and is true if things are as the claim purports. Moral\nrealists are those who think that, in these respects, things should be\ntaken at face value\u2014moral claims do purport to report facts and\nare true if they get the facts right. Moreover, they hold, at least\nsome moral claims actually are true. That much is the common and more\nor less defining ground of moral realism (although some accounts of\nmoral realism see it as involving additional commitments, say to the\nindependence of the moral facts from human thought and practice, or to\nthose facts being objective in some specified way).\n\n\nAs a result, those who reject moral realism are usefully divided\ninto (i) those who think moral claims do not purport to report facts in\nlight of which they are true or false (noncognitivists) and (ii) those\nwho think that moral claims do carry this purport but deny that any\nmoral claims are actually true (error theorists).\n\n\nIt is worth noting that, while moral realists are united in their\ncognitivism and in their rejection of error theories, they disagree\namong themselves not only about which moral claims are actually true\nbut about what it is about the world that makes those claims true.\nMoral realism is not a particular substantive moral view nor does it\ncarry a distinctive metaphysical commitment over and above the\ncommitment that comes with thinking moral claims can be true or false\nand some are true. Still, much of the debate about moral realism\nrevolves around either what it takes for claims to be true or false at\nall (with some arguing that moral claims do not have what it takes) or\nwhat it would take specifically for moral claims to be true (with some\narguing that moral claims would require something the world does not\nprovide).\n\n\nThe debate between moral realists and anti-realists assumes, though,\nthat there is a shared object of inquiry\u2014in this case, a range\nof claims all involved are willing to recognize as moral\nclaims\u2014about which two questions can be raised and answered: Do\nthese claims purport to report facts in light of which they are true\nor false? Are some of them true? Moral realists answer\n\u2018yes\u2019 to both, non-cognitivists answer \u2018no\u2019 to\nthe first (and, by default, \u2018no\u2019 to the second) while\nerror theorists answer \u2018yes\u2019 to the first and\n\u2018no\u2019 to the second. (With the introduction of\n\u201cminimalism\u201d about truth and facts, things become a bit\nmore complicated. See the section on semantics, below.) To note that\nsome other, non-moral, claims do not (or do) purport to report facts\nor that none (or some) of them are true, is to change the\nsubject. That said, it is strikingly hard to nail down with any\naccuracy just which claims count as moral and so are at issue in the\ndebate. For the most part, those concerned with whether moral realism\nis true are forced to work back and forth between an intuitive grasp\nof which claims are at issue and an articulate but controversial\naccount of what they have in common such that realism either is, or is\nnot, defensible about them.\n\n\nBy all accounts, moral realism can fairly claim to have common sense\nand initial appearances on its side. That advantage, however, might be\neasily outweighed; there are a number of powerful arguments for\nholding that it is a mistake to think of moral claims as true.\n",
