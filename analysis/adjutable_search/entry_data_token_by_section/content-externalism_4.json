    "main_text": "Content Externalism || Responses to Content Externalism\n3.2 Responses to Content Externalism\n\nResponses to content externalism divide into several kinds. The first\ntype of response simply regards externalism as insufficiently\nsupported by the kinds of arguments developed by Putnam and Burge,\neither because their conclusions are non sequiturs or because the\narguments are deficient in some other way. In this vein, Boghossian\n(1997), for example, devises the case of \u201cDry Earth\u201d, a\nplanet whose inhabitants (who are our intrinsic duplicates) are under\nthe illusion that there is a clear, colorless liquid flowing\nout of the faucets and filling the lakes and oceans. According to\nBoghossian, externalists are committed to implausible claims\nconcerning the content of Dry Earthlings\u2019 thoughts about this\nillusory liquid. (Segal [2000] endorses a variation on this argument\nfrom Dry Earth; see Korman [2006] and Pryor [2007] for externalist\nreplies.). Crane (1991) argues that in Burge\u2019s example, there is\nno reason for thinking that Jane has different concepts in the two\nsituations, as her dispositions remain exactly the same. Crane thinks\nthat in both situations, Jane lacks the concept of arthritis, but\npossesses the concept of tharthritis. Burge was, therefore, mistaken\nin attributing to Jane in the actual world the belief that she has\narthritis in her thigh. Georgalis (1999) takes a similar view, as does\nWikforss (2001).\n\nA second type of response objects to these externalist arguments on\nbroadly methodological grounds that concern the use of thought\nexperiments, and intuitions more generally, in determining whether\ncontent is wide or narrow. Cummins (1991) argues that empirical\nresearch is needed to find out about the nature of belief, not thought\nexperiments. Chomsky (1995) holds a similar view. The reliance of\nPutnam\u2019s and Burge\u2019s arguments on intuitions is anathema\nto many in the experimental philosophy movement who regard them as\nculturally-relative and shifting and, therefore, not philosophically\nsignificant (see, for example, Mallon et al. 2009).\n\nA third type of response questions the legitimacy of the\ninternalism-externalism debate. Gertler (2012), for example, has\nargued that there is no understanding of the distinction between\ninternal and external properties, and related distinctions such as\nthat between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, that will correctly\ncategorize the views we take to be clearly externalist or internalist.\nIf Gertler is correct, perhaps the most common way of understanding\ninternalism, as the doctrine that content supervenes on the intrinsic\nproperties of an individual, is unworkable. She therefore maintains\nthat there is no genuine dispute at issue in the\ninternalism-externalism debate, and recommends that philosophers drop\nthe issue in favor of more well-defined questions. There is, more\ngenerally, an interesting question concerning how to understand the\ncrucial distinction between a creature\u2019s external properties and\nthose that are intrinsic or internal. Many contributors to the debate\nover externalism take internal properties to be physical\nproperties of a creature that do not depend for their instantiation on\nany property instantiated outside the boundary of the creature\u2019s\nbody and brain. A difficulty with this understanding of the\ndistinction, pointed out by Farkas (2003), is that it appears to rule\nout the possibility of antiphysicalist internalists. This is ironic,\ngiven that Descartes is often held up as a paradigmatic example of an\ninternalist about mental content. Williamson (2000) suggests that\ninternalism can be understood as the doctrine that mental content\nsupervenes on environmentally-independent phenomenal states, and\nFarkas (2003, 2008) makes a similar proposal.\n",
