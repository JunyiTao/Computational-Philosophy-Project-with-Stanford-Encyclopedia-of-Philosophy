That would\nhave been an innocuous claim; everyone agreed that material substances\nroutinely have many accidental forms. The theory of plurality\nof forms is instead the theory that there is a plurality of\nsubstantial forms in a given material substance. Details of\nthe theory varied widely from author to\n author.[6]\n There was some disagreement over how many substantial forms were\ninvolved. Most people who held a version of this theory agreed that at\nleast a \u201cform of corporeity\u201d was required in all physical substances,\nbut they disagreed over how many additional substantial forms were\nrequired for a given kind of body. Particular attention was given to\nthe case of the human body.\n\n\nThe arguments in support of this theory were quite diverse, and come\nfrom a variety of directions. William of Ockham, for instance, held\nthat if the form of corporeity were not distinct from the intellective\nsoul and were not essentially present in the human being both during\nhis life and after the intellective soul departs at death, then once a\nsaint had died it would be false to say that the body that remains is\nthe body that saint ever had. Hence the cult of venerating the bodies\nof the saints would make no sense. (Quodlibet II, q.\n 11.[7])\n\n\nAgain, Thomas Aquinas, although he rejects plurality or forms,\nnevertheless records several arguments given on its behalf. Among\n them[8]\n\n\n\nFurthermore, before the coming of the rational soul the body in the\nwomb of the mother has some form. Now when the rational soul comes, it\ncannot be said that this form disappears, because it does not lapse\ninto nothingness, nor would it be possible to specify anything into\nwhich it might return. Therefore, some form exists in the matter\nprevious to the rational soul \u2026\n\n\nFurthermore, in VII Metaphysica [11, 1036a 26] it is said\nthat every definition has parts, and that the parts of a definition are\nforms. In anything that is defined, therefore, there must be several\nforms. Since, therefore, man is a kind of defined thing, it is\nnecessary to posit in him several forms; and so some form exists before\nthe rational soul.\n\n",
