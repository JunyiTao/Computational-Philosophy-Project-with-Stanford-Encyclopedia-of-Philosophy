    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Locke has been widely hailed for providing an epistemological\nfoundation for the experimental science of his day, articulating the\nnew, probabilistic form of knowledge appropriate to it. Yet, while he\nis in important respects a devotee of that new science, there are also\nsignificant tensions in his thought. He stands behind its experimental\nmethods as he targets the earlier, speculative or rationalist\nphilosophies for relying on methodologies and epistemological\nexpectations unsuited to natural philosophy. He also frequently\nappears to embrace the new science\u2019s corpuscular hypothesis,\nwhose powers and minute particles figure prominently in his attempt to\nunderstand why we cannot hope for demonstrative certainty about\nnatural phenomena. Still, the new science\u2019s methodology was\nevolving. Just how far did Locke travel with that evolution, and what\naspects of his thought prevented him from going further? As for the\ncorpuscular hypothesis, what exactly was his stance toward it? He\nfrequently speaks of particles and powers as if they belonged to\nestablished knowledge, and yet in explaining the hypothesis\u2019s\nflaws, he seems to consider them fatal. This article will mainly\nemphasize the second of those related questions, though both have\nspurred scholarly investigation and debate.\n",
