    "main_text": "Revising the Foundations of Deontic Logic || Rejecting Core Principles of SDL: OB-NEC and OB-RM\n6.3 Rejecting Core Principles of SDL: OB-NEC and OB-RM\n\nRather than questioning its semantic foundations on their own terms,\none may also argue against SDL in view of the logical principles it\nvalidates. Here we outline a number of distinct arguments and examples\nthat have been raised against specific principles of SDL, after which\nwe show how some of these can be overcome by moving to weaker\nsystems.\n\nLet us start with \\(\\OB\\)-NEC. This rule requires that any\ntautological statement is obligatory. Now consider the following\nstatement:\n\n(1)\nNothing is obligatory.\n\n\nIt seems that what (1) expresses, an absence of obligations, is\npossible. For example, consider a time when no rational agents existed\nin the universe. Why should we think that any obligations\u2014even\nthose pertaining to tautological states of affairs\u2014existed\n then?[85]\n\nIf we are reading \\(\\OB\\) as simply \u201cit ought to be the case\nthat\u201d, it is not clear that there is anything counterintuitive\nabout \\(\\OB \\top\\) (now read as, essentially, \u201cit ought to be\nthat contradictions are false\u201d), but there is also no longer any\nobvious connection to what is obligatory or permissible for that\nreading, or to what people ought to do. A different way of avoiding\nthe counterintuitive consequences of \\(\\OB\\)-NEC is by distinguishing\nbetween \u201cvacuous\u201d obligations such as \\(\\OB (p \\vee \\neg\np)\\) and those that require the satisfaction of some logically\ncontingent statement such as \\(\\OB (p \\amp \\neg q)\\). This can, e.g.,\nbe done by enriching one\u2019s language with a modal operator\n\\(\\Box\\) for \u201csettled true\u201d (cf. Belnap 2001 et al., Horty\n2001).\n\nNext on the list of problematic principles is \\(\\OB\\)-RM, also known\nas the principle of Inheritance. This principle states that whenever\nsomething is obligatory, then everything that is a logical consequence\nis also obligatory (\u201cinherits\u201d that status). There are\nvarious well-known examples highlighting problems with \\(\\OB\\)-RM. The\nearliest and most well-known challenge to RM is Ross\u2019s\nParadox (Ross 1941). From\n\n(1)\n\u201cIt is obligatory that the letter is mailed\u201d\n\n\nformalized as \\(\\OB m\\), we can derive:\n\n(2)\n\u201cIt is obligatory that the letter is mailed (m) or the\nletter is burned (b).\u201d\n\n\nFormalized as \\(\\OB(m \\vee b)\\). It seems rather odd to say that an\nobligation to mail the letter entails an obligation to mail the letter\nor burn it (where burning the letter is presumably forbidden), one\nthat can be fulfilled by burning the letter, which invites from the\noffender: \u201cWell at least I did one thing right by burning\nit\u201d.\n\nWhile weakening from \\(m\\) to \\(m \\vee b\\) gives problems, similar\nissues arise when we weaken a conjunction to one of its conjuncts.\nThis is illustrated by the famous Good Samaritan Paradox\n(Prior\n 1958):[86]\n\n(1)\nIt is obligatory that Jones help Smith who has been robbed.\n(2)\nIt is obligatory that Smith has been robbed.\n\n\nSupposing that Jones helps Smith who has been robbed if and only if\nJones helps Smith and Smith has been robbed, it would appear that a\ncorrect way to symbolize (1) and (2) in SDLs is: \n\n\\[\\tag{\\(1'\\)} \\OB (h \\amp r) \\] \\[\\tag{\\(2'\\)} \\OB r\\]\n\n\nBy \\(\\OB\\)-RM, \\(\\OB(h \\amp r)\\) entails \\(\\OB r\\). However, it hardly\nseems that if helping the robbed man is obligatory it follows that his\nbeing robbed is likewise\n obligatory.[87]\n A much-discussed, epistemic variant of the Good Samaritan is\ndiscussed in supplement F,\n the Paradox of Epistemic Obligation.\n\nThere have been various responses to these RM-related paradoxes. Some\ndefend RM and blame the Ross paradox on an elementary confusion\n(F\u00f8llesdal & Hilpinen 1971) or cite pragmatic features to\nexplain away the puzzle (Casta\u00f1eda 1981): no one would, e.g.,\nmerely utter the statement that John ought to mail or burn the letter,\nknowing that in fact John ought to just mail the letter. Similarly, it\nhas been argued that the Good Samaritan paradox is really a\nconditional obligation paradox, and so RM is not the real source of\nthe paradox (Casta\u00f1eda 1981; Tomberlin 1981). However, since\nthese paradoxes all at least appear to depend on \\(\\OB\\)-RM,\na natural solution to the problems is to undercut the paradoxes by\nrejecting \\(\\OB\\)-RM itself. Two accessible and closely related\nexamples of approaches to deontic logic that reject \\(\\OB\\)-RM from a\nprincipled philosophical perspective are Jackson 1985 and Goble\n 1990a.[88]\n A third, somewhat different principled strategy is proposed in\nCariani 2013 and studied in formal detail in Van De Putte 2019.\nFinally, in S. O. Hansson 1990, and more elaborately in Hansson 2001,\nS.O. Hansson develops systems of deontic logic where he analyzes\nprohibitive and prescriptive deontic notions in terms of abstract\nproperties of various preference orderings (e.g., a normative status\nis prohibitive whenever anything worse than something that has that\nstatus also has it). He also sees \\(\\OB\\)-RM as the main culprit in\nthe paradoxes of standard deontic logic, and thus he methodically\nexplores non-standard frameworks where \\(\\OB\\)-RM is not\n sound.[89]\n\nOne very general semantic framework for logics that can invalidate\nnecessitation, inheritance, or other principles of normal modal logics\nis the neighborhood semantic\n framework.[90]\n , A neighborhood semantics works with a set of possible worlds (just\nlike Kripke-semantics) but replaces the accessibility relation with a\nneighborhood function \\(\\rN\\) that maps every world \\(w\\) onto a set\nof sets \\(X, Y,\\ldots\\) of possible worlds \\(\\rN(w)\\), often thought\nof as a set of propositions. On such a semantics, \\(\\OB p\\) is true at\na world \\(w\\) iff the set of all \\(p\\)-worlds is in the neighborhood\nof \\(w\\), i.e. \n\n\\[ M, w \\vDash \\OB p \\textrm{ iff } |p| \\in \\rN(w) \\]\n\n\nOn the weakest logic characterized by such neighborhood models (the\nminimal \u201cclassical modal logic\u201d, E), only \\(\\OB\\)-RE is\nvalid. Additional validities and rules can be obtained by imposing\nspecific conditions on the neighborhood functions. Furthermore,\nneighborhood semantics can be naturally generalized to deal with\nconditional obligations (Chellas 1974, 1980), and combined with\nsemantic accounts of related concepts such as agency and ability\n(McNamara 2019). It can also accommodate conflict-tolerant logics, as\nwe will see next.\n",
