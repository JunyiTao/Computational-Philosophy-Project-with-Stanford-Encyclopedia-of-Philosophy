    "main_text": "New Relativism || Truth relativism and knowledge ascriptions\n5.5 Truth relativism and knowledge ascriptions\nMacFarlane (2005b) argues that \u201cknow\u201d is sensitive to the epistemic standards at play in the context of assessment; that is, the extension of \u201cknow\u201d varies with the context of assessment. Much as the relativist about future contingents aimed to accommodate both the determinacy and indeterminacy intuitions, the relativist about knowledge attributions can be viewed as offering an attempted synthesis between the contextualist and both sensitive and insensitive varieties of invariantist (see entry on Epistemic Contextualism). As MacFarlane (2014: 190) puts it:\n\nInvariantism is right that there is a single knowledge relation, and that the accuracy of knowledge ascriptions does not depend on which epistemic standard is relevant at the context of use. But contextualism is right that the accuracy of such ascriptions depends somehow on contextually relevant standards. Relativism seeks to synthesize these insights into a more satisfactory picture.\n\nTo apply this view, suppose George says, \u201cBill knows that his car is in the driveway\u201d, while Barry says, \u201cBill doesn\u2019t know that his car is in the driveway\u201d. According to the relativist, the assessment of the truth-values of Bill\u2019s and Barry\u2019s statements depends also on the specification of some epistemic standard. For the truth-relativist, the standard will be the operative standard in the context of assessment. George\u2019s utterance may be true (and Barry\u2019s false) relative to a context of assessment in which ordinary \u201clow\u201d standards are in place, whereas Barry\u2019s may be true (and George\u2019s false) relative to a context of assessment in which high \u201cCartesian\u201d standards are in place. See Stanley (2005: ch. 7) for a detailed criticism of this position, though see also MacFarlane (2014: \u00a78.5 for a reply). See also Richard (2004), for another version of truth-relativism for knowledge attributions. In MacFarlane\u2019s more recent (2014) defense of a truth-relativist semantics for \u201cknows\u201d, the context of assessment is taken to fix which alternatives count as relevant. See, however, Carter 2015 for an argument that MacFarlane\u2019s more recent view generates counterintuitive results in cases of environmental epistemic luck (e.g., barn fa\u00e7ade-style cases) and normative defeaters.\n",
