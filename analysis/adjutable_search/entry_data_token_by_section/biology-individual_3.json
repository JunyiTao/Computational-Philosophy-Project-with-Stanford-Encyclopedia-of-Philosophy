    "main_text": "Conceptual Space, Distinctions, and Beyond Organisms || Beyond Organisms: Microbialism, Eliminativism, and Holobionts\n3.1 Beyond Organisms: Microbialism, Eliminativism, and Holobionts\n\nScientists themselves\u2014following common sense\u2014have been\ndrawn first and foremost to organisms when beginning their theorizing\nabout biological individuals. For example, consider John Maynard Smith\nand E\u00f6rs Szathm\u00e1ry\u2019s The Major Transitions of\nLife (1995), a wide-ranging book on the origins and evolution of\nlife that has stimulated much work on the evolution of individuality (Buss\n1987) and the Darwinian dynamics (Michod 1999) that governs emerging\nkinds of biological entities (see\n section 9\n below). The book opens with a simple point about the living world and\na characterization of the book\u2019s chief theme: \n\n\nLiving organisms are highly complex, and are composed of parts that\nfunction to ensure the survival and reproduction of the whole. This\nbook is about how and why this complexity has increased in the course\nof evolution. The increase has been neither universal nor inevitable.\n(Maynard Smith & Szathm\u00e1ry 1995: 3) \n\n\nHere organisms or biological individuals are viewed as exemplars of\ncomplex living things composed of many parts, and their complexity is\ntaken to have increased\u2014albeit unevenly and\ncontingently\u2014through evolution by natural selection. \n\nLikewise, an early collection of essays on evolutionary developmental\nbiology (\u201cevo-devo\u201d) by Gerd M\u00fcller and Stuart Newman\n(2003) focuses on how organismal form originated and on the\nevolutionary, developmental, and ecological processes shaping it over\ngenerations. The essays in that volume concentrate on the\nrelationships between basic body plans of organisms over phylogenetic\ntime, rather than the evolution of individuality as such, and do not\ntake up The Focal Question about biological individuals at all. But\nlike that of Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry, the project of\nexploring these relationships is naturally expressed in terms of the\nconcept of an organism. \n\nThis should occasion no surprise, since, as\n section 1\n indicated, historically organisms have been regarded as prominent\nexamples of biological individuals and organism and\nbiological individual have often been used interchangeably.\nBut the short quotation drawn from Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\nalso helps to explain why simply equating biological individuals with\norganisms would be a mistake. The parts that compose organisms in all\ntheir complexity are, often enough, themselves biological individuals.\nEven if some of those parts are also organisms (e.g., the microbes\nthat live on and in macrobes), many are not. Precisely the same is\ntrue of the populations and lineages that individual organisms in turn\nconstitute. These may occasionally be organisms (e.g., eusocial insect\ncolonies as \u201csuperorganisms\u201d), but typically populations\nand lineages are biological individuals that are not\norganisms. If either this internal compositional complexity to\norganisms or their formation into populations and lineages are\nnecessary features of organisms (which many philosophers and\nbiologists at least tend to think they are; see Lidgard & Nyhart\n2017a: 18\u201323), then this would prove a stronger conclusion:\ngiven that there are organisms, there must be some biological\nindividuals that are not organisms.\n\nSo one way in which the traditional focus on organisms can hinder us\nin thinking about biological individuals is if, by equating the two,\nthere is too little attention focused on biological individuals that\nare not organisms. But hindrance here could take a different form, as\nsome have argued. One might think that a focus on organisms,\nparticularly those identified at the ground level of common sense,\ncommits not just this kind of error of omission, but also proves\npositively misleading about what biological individuals are.\nConsider two positions that challenge the privileging of organisms in\ndiscussions of The Focal Question:\n\nMicrobialism: Understanding the living world requires\nfocusing on collaborations between macrobes and a variety of\nmicrobes (e.g., viruses, prions, plasmids, symbionts), taking\nseriously the idea that the biological individuals identified at the\nground level of common sense constitute a small part of that world\n(Dupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley 2007, 2009).\nEliminativism: Far from being paradigmatic\nbiological individuals, organisms may be marginal or unusual special\ncases of biological individuals and should be eliminated from our\nontology (Haber 2013, Okasha 2011).\n\n\nMicrobialism has been part and parcel of Dupr\u00e9 and\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s plaint against the macrobist bias in\nthe philosophy of biology and the positive case they have made for the\nsignificance of the microbial world for reconceptualizing biological\nindividuals (O\u2019Malley 2014, 2015; O\u2019Malley, Simpson, &\nRoger 2013; Dupr\u00e9 2010). One direction that this has been taken\nis Dupr\u00e9\u2019s (2012) promiscuous individualism.\n\n\nPromiscuous individualism is not simply the view that there are many\nlegitimate ways to classify the world into biological individuals. It\nis also the corresponding ontological view that such legitimation is\nprovided by there being multiple biological individuals there to\nclassify. To illustrate this view, consider lichens, which are\ntypically regarded as what have been called corporate\norganisms (R.A. Wilson 2005: 80\u201384), in this case made up\nof a fungus and either a cyanobacterium or some other\nphotosynthesizing agent, such as green algae. Challenging the view\nthat there is just one biological individual (the lichen) or two (the\nfungus and the cyanobacterium), an advocate of promiscuous\nindividualism can readily make the case that there are three\nbiological individuals (the lichen, the fungus, and the\ncyanobacterium), pointing to the different purposes and goals one\nmight have in opting for any of the numerical counts here. \n\nGiven that it is a population of millions of cyanobacteria inhabiting\nany given fungus that jointly compose a lichen, and that there are\nmultiple ways to draw the boundary between individual fungi of a given\nspecies (Molter 2017), note how rampant promiscuity can run here.\nDupr\u00e9 himself holds that populations, including multispecies\npopulations such as those found in microbial biofilms, can themselves\nbe both biological individuals and organisms (2012: 89, 175\u2013176,\n194, 203). He also says that \u201c[w]hether a group of microbes is a\nclosely connected ecological community or an organism may be a matter\nof biological judgment\u201d (2012: 153). Promiscuous individualism\nthus implies that there are many, many different numbers of\nindividuals present in this paradigm case. It seems even to suggest\nthat whether there are any biological individuals at all is\n\u201ca matter of biological judgment\u201d, rather than something\ndetermined by the biological facts. \n\nThe emphasis on collaborations between living things in Microbialism\ncan undermine the focus on organisms without entering (at least\ndirectly) into these deep metaphysical waters. That emphasis can also\nmotivate Eliminativism. One way it can do so is by embracing the idea\nthat it is not organisms but holobionts that are really\nparadigmatic biological individuals. A holobiont is, at least roughly,\n\u201cthe multicellular eukaryote plus its colonies of\nsymbionts\u201d (Gilbert & Tauber 2016: 842). This concept is\nattractive to some scientists (e.g., Zilber-Rosenberg & Rosenberg\n2008; Bordenstein & Theis 2015; Bosch & Miller 2016; cf.\nDouglas & Werren 2016) while also sparking ongoing philosophical\nwork (Theis et al. 2016, Booth 2014, Doolittle & Booth 2017). For\nexample, a recent special issue of the journal Biology &\nPhilosophy on biological individuality (volume 31, issue 6)\ncontains papers that focus on the significance of the holobiont for\nimmunology (Chiu & Eberl 2016; Gilbert & Tauber 2016) and for\nthe evolution of individuality and its major transitions (Queller\n& Strassmann 2016, Skillings 2016; cf. Bourrat & Griffiths\n2018).\n\nLike the concept of an organism that it putatively supplements or\nsupplants, that of the holobiont encompasses a huge diversity of\nentities. These include macro-organisms and the microbial\nendosymbionts living within their cells (such as Chlamydia\nand other obligate parasites); those that live beyond their cells but\nin close symbiotic relations (such as cyanobacteria); and the\nmultispecies microbiota that inhabit the human intestine (Booth 2014).\nThere are challenges in how to delineate individual holobionts that,\nas we will see in the next section, may be met by embracing particular\nphysiological criteria for individuation (Pradeu 2012). Yet those\nchallenges have suggested to some that the take-away lesson from\nreflection on holobionts is that emphasis should be placed not on\nanother kind of individual, a holobiont, but instead on the process of\nholobiosis (Doolittle & Booth 2017). It remains too early\nto tell whether the concept of the holobiont will live up to its\nstill-early promise of revolutionizing thinking about biological\nindividuals; this will likely be an area of emerging and exciting work\nfor the next several years.\n",
