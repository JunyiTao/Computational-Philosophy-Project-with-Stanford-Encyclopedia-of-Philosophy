    "main_text": "Economics and Ethics || Positive vs. Normative Economics\n1.1 Positive vs. Normative Economics\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century, most leading economists\n(Pigou, Hicks, Kaldor, Samuelson, Arrow etc.) devoted a significant\npart of their research effort to normative issues, notably the\ndefinition of criteria for the evaluation of public policies. The\nsituation is very different nowadays. \u201cEconomists do not devote\na great deal of time to investigating the values on which their\nanalyses are based. Welfare economics is not a subject which every\npresent-day student of economics is expected to study\u201d, writes\nAtkinson (2001, p. 195), who regrets \u201cthe strange disappearance\nof welfare economics\u201d. Normative economics itself may be partly\nguilty for this state of affairs, in view of its repeated failure to\nprovide conclusive results and its long-lasting focus on impossibility\ntheorems (see\n \u00a7 4.1).\n But there has also been a persistent ambiguity about the status of\nnormative propositions in economics. The subject matter of economics\nand its close relation to policy advice make it virtually impossible\nto avoid mingling with value judgments. Nonetheless, the desire to\nseparate positive statements from normative statements has often been\ntransformed into the illusion that economics could be a science only\nby shunning the latter. Robbins (1932) has been influential in this\npositivist move, in spite of a late clarification (Robbins 1981) that\nhis intention was not to disparage normative issues, but only to\nclarify the normative status of (useful and necessary) interpersonal\ncomparisons of welfare. It is worth emphasizing that many results in\nnormative economics are mathematical theorems with a primary\nanalytical function. Endowing them with a normative content may be\nconfusing, because they are most useful in clarifying ethical values\nand do not imply by themselves that these values must be endorsed.\n\u201cIt is a legitimate exercise of economic analysis to examine the\nconsequences of various value judgments, whether or not they are\nshared by the theorist.\u201d (Samuelson 1947, p. 220) The role of\nethical judgments in economics has received recent and valuable\nscrutiny in Sen (1987), Hausman and McPherson (2006) and Mongin\n(2001b).\n",
