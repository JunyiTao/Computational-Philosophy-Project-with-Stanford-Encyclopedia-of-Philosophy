    "main_text": "Saving the Thesis: Alternative Conceptions of Chance and Randomness || Process Randomness: Epistemic Theories\n6.2 Process Randomness: Epistemic Theories\n\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of\n \u00a72,\n sometimes\n\u2018random\u2019 is used in a process sense. There have been some\nphilosophical approaches to randomness which attempt to take this\nseriously, but which do not take it to be merely equivalent to\n\u2018chancy\u2019 and thus trivialise RCT. The most popular such\napproach is to connect randomness with indeterminism, and to\ndefend RCT by arguing directly that indeterminism yields both chance\nand randomness. Prospects for that approach will be discussed\n in\n \u00a77.\n\n\nThe next most discussed view of process randomness is an epistemic\none. Random processes on this view are those whose outcomes we cannot\nknow in advance; that is, random processes are unpredictable\n(Eagle 2005; Kyburg 1974: ch.\n 9).[23]\n Here is one clear\nexpression of the view:\nAt the most basic level, we say an event is random if there\nis no way to predict its occurrence with certainty. Likewise, a random\nprocess is one for which we are not able to predict what happens next.\n(Frigg 2004: 430)\n\n\nFor this kind of view to yield the right results, we cannot count as\n\u2018being able to predict a process\u2019 if we merely guess\nrightly about its outcomes. For that reason, prediction must involve\nsome notion of reasonableness; it must be rational for the\nagent to make the predictions they do. For example, Eagle (2005: 770)\ninsists that it is the physical theory accepted by the predicting agent\nthat makes certain posterior credences reasonable; simply guessing will\nnot be reasonable, even if it\u2019s correct.\n\n\nThis definition overlaps considerably with those definitions of\nrandomness canvassed in\n \u00a72.\n In particular, if a\nprocess is predictable, that will make available a winning betting\nstrategy on the sequence of outcomes of that process, which cannot\ntherefore be a KML-random sequence of outcomes. So unpredictability of\nthe generating process is a necessary condition on KML-randomness of\nany concrete outcome sequence.\n\n\nBut unpredictability is not sufficient, for it may be that we cannot\nknow everything true of the future outcomes of the process, and those\ntruths might preclude a KML-random sequence. One way to see this draws\non our discussion of chaotic dynamics. Let\u2019s say that a system exhibits\napparent dependence on initial conditions if states\nindiscriminable to us may end up arbitrarily far apart after some\nrelatively short period of time. (Another definition, if knowledge\nobeys a margin for error principle, would be: a system exhibits\napparent dependence on initial conditions if, for all we know, it is\nsensitively dependent on initial conditions.) Apparent dependence on\ninitial conditions can obtain even if sensitive dependence on initial\nconditions does not. For there may well be a size \\(v\\) such that,\nunder some partition of the set of states into regions of measure\nsmaller than \\(v\\), any two points starting in the same cell of\nthe partition evolve to future states which are close to one\nanother\u2014as long as \\(v\\) is small with respect to our\nabilities to discriminate. A system which is apparently but not\nsensitively dependent on initial conditions will be unpredictable to\nus, but there will exist an algorithm that, given some finite\nspecification of the initial conditions, generates the future evolution\nof the system perfectly. (The key is that the finite specification must\ninvolve more precise data than we could know to characterise the\nsystem.) This sequence, if long enough, is not KML-random, but it is\n unpredictable.[24]\n\n\nBecause of the considerable overlap between the unpredictably\ngenerated sequences and the KML-random sequences (Frigg 2004: 431),\nmany roles the latter can play will be played by the former too. Eagle\n(2005) further argues that the unpredictably generated sequences are a\nbetter fit to the theoretical role of randomness, and claims on that\nbasis that randomness is unpredictability. One nice thing\nabout this thesis is that, being a process notion, it directly connects\nwith chance processes. We can thus directly evaluate the original\nthesis connecting chance and randomness, CT, in the form:\n(CTU) A process is chancy iff it is not\nrationally predictable.\n\n\nThe left-to-right direction of CTU looks relatively secure when we\nattend just to independent and identically distributed trials. But when\nthe trials are not independent, like the examples in\n \u00a74.4,\n future outcomes can happen by chance, even if\nknowing the past states of the system does put one in a position to\nbetter predict the future outcomes. The right-to-left direction of CTU\nis in even worse straits. For if KML-randomness of a sequence entails\nits unpredictable generation, then every counterexample to RCT which\ninvolves KML-randomness without chance will also involve\nunpredictability without chance, and also constitute a counterexample\nto CTU. There is no succour to be found for defenders of RCT in this\nconception of randomness.\n",
