    "main_text": "Philosophy, Philosophers, and Rhetoric || Philosophers\n2.2 Philosophers\n2.2.1 Jewish philosophers\n\nWe have little information about Jewish intellectuals in the\nHellenistic epoch. One of our main sources is the Sentences\nof Pseudo-Phocylides (Barclay 2007), most likely written in Alexandria\nby a Jew. They show an interesting mix of Jewish and Greek elements:\nan absence of attacks against polytheism, some popular Stoic themes,\nand a rather soft affirmation of the monotheistic faith. It is not\neasy, however, to date these Sentences. The most probable\ndate would be somewhere between 30 BCE and 40 CE, but other dates are\npossible. Regardless, the Sentences provides an image of what\ncould have been a Jewish openness towards pagan culture if relations\nwere calmer. According to a well-attested tradition, some Jews posited\nthat Plato had taken his inspiration from Moses, an idea that seems to\nhave been popularized by Aristobulus of Paneas, a Jewish philosopher\nwho lived in the first half of second century BCE. Philo, who lived in\na more unstable period, employs this kind of assertion with prudence\n(Spec. 2.164\u2013167). He himself sometimes alludes to his\nimmediate predecessors, which is the topic of Goulet\u2019s book\n(1987). Goulet\u2019s central thesis is that the primary source of\nPhilo\u2019s allegories was a Jewish commentary that used Stoic\nmethods of interpretation to attempt a wholly rationalist exegesis of\nthe Bible devoid of any notion of transcendence. In fact, there is\nonly one clear allusion to these phusiologoi, i.e.,\nrationalist allegorists. It is likely that in Alexandria there were\nJews who attempted to interpret the Bible as the Stoics had\ninterpreted Homer (Niehoff 2011). It is unclear whether their\ninterpretation was integrated into a comprehensive system of\nrationalism. The allegoric interpretation did not prevent Stoics from\ndefending divination, a practice that was considered absurd by their\nopponents. One could add that this evolution towards a more religious\ncast of mind was not a distinctive characteristic of Philo, but rather\na hallmark of the Middle-Platonist period as a whole.\n2.2.2 Greek philosophers\n\nNamed references to philosophers in Philo\u2019s work are rather\nrare, and often the cited names are not those that one would expect.\nFor example, he never mentions Posidonius, one of the greatest names\nof Stoicism, who was the first to attempt a reconciliation of at least\nsome Stoic and Platonic themes. There are reasons to think Philo read\nthis Rhodian philosopher, but he is silent about Posidonius. One could\nsurmise that his clearly anti-Jewish position was one possible reason\nfor Philo\u2019s silence. However, Philo is also silent regarding\nthinkers of the New Academy, Arcesilas and Carneades. He was clearly\nacquainted with these Academics, since there are some rather clear\nallusions in his work to their brand of skepticism. It is therefore\ncurious that he gives the first version of the Skeptical tropes\nwithout any allusion to Aenesidemus, who developed them a century\nbefore. Leaving aside the contested De aeternitate, we notice\nthat Philo fails to mention Aristotle even once. While Stoicism plays\na leading though complex role in most Philonian treatises, we only\nfind four allusions to Zeno, the founder of the doctrine. They are all\nin the Probus, a treatise with strong Stoic features. There\nis only a single mention of Epicurus, in Post. 2. Plato is\nmentioned twice each in the De opificio and the De uita\ncontemplativa, and once in the Probus. Only three\nmentions of Socrates are found, but surprisingly, the presocratic\nthinkers are quoted much more than one would have thought: fourteen\nreferences to Pythagoras (with some uncertainties, since some of them\nare to be found in fragments), six to Heraclitus, and one each to\nAnaxagoras and Democritus. The De aeternitate is striking\nbecause Aristotle is mentioned four times. In this treatise, Philo\ncites a book written by the Pythagorean Ocellos of Lucania, who\nestablished the eternity of the world in a way that Philo seems to\nfind satisfactory. This, notably, is the only time when he mentions a\nspecific text and explicitly affirms having read it.\n\nOne might wonder whether there is a logic to Philo\u2019s explicit\nreferences to philosophers.\n\nSeveral elements point us toward a more complete understanding. First,\nPhilo evidently prefers indirect allusions to direct citations.\nPhilosophical concepts are necessary to the elaboration of exegesis,\nbut too many precise mentions of philosophers would have presented\nPhilo himself as subordinate not to the Word of God but to the\ndoctrines of philosophers. He is still more silent about the great\nrabbis he would have certainly met in Alexandria and perhaps in\nJerusalem. In his philosophical references, it is clear that he\nprefers to evoke the presocratic thinkers and the classical period of\nphilosophy than the Hellenistic one. This is paradoxical since he was\ndeeply marked by Hellenistic philosophy, which was the natural\nenvironment of his education. It must be added that his prose is also\ngenerally classical, reluctant to admit neologisms and technical\nvocabulary. He certainly wanted to appear in all areas a man of\ntradition.\n2.2.3 \u201cBarbarian\u201d philosophers\n\nDid Philo think that philosophy was a Greek monopoly, only shared with\nsome Jews?\n\nIn recent years, the temptation has been great among some scholars to\nimagine that he had at least some knowledge of non-Greek thinkers such\nas Cicero and Seneca (L\u00e9vy 2021). The problem remains that we\nhave no evidence of this hypothesis. Philo never evoked Roman\nphilosophers, so we cannot pass beyond statements of probability. More\ngenerally, what can be said about Philo\u2019s attitude towards\n\u201cbarbarian\u201d wisdom can be summarized in three points:\n\n\n\nJewish wisdom surpasses all other wisdom, both Greek and barbarian,\nbecause it is the only one inspired by God. In Mos. 2.12,\nPhilo makes no attempt to hide that when the Bible was first\ntranslated into Greek, the Word of God was considered by many an\nexpression of barbarian wisdom. The Septuagint is implicitly presented\nas proof that the distinction between Greek and barbarian could be\nabolished, though for Greek civilization this distinction had great\nontological weight.\n\n\nEven Greek education, despite its exceptional prestige, is unable to\nprovide access to the truth. A learned man according to the criterion\nof the paideia is no more able than anyone else to say what\nthe world truly is.\n\n\nPhilo did not deny that barbarians were able to create sophisticated\nforms of sciences and culture. Despite his own contempt for the\nEgyptians, he stresses that Moses himself received an education in\nwhich Egyptian sciences were included. Furthermore, he argues that\nmany barbarians, though untutored in philosophy, have a natural\nintuition of how to live in agreement with virtue. In Somn.\n2.56, the Indian ascetics (\u201cgymnosophists\u201d) appear as the\nbarbarian form of the Cynic life, lacking any form of luxury or\nmaterial comfort, and in Probus 96, the letter of the ascetic\nCalanos to Alexander [now known to be fake] provides the best evidence\nthat some barbarians could practice a perfectly philosophical life\nwithout ever having received a Greek education.\n\n2.2.4 Philosophy and rhetoric\n\nThrough the many studies Manuel Alexandre Jr (1999) devoted to\nPhilo\u2019s rhetoric, we can more precisely gauge Philo\u2019s\nposition in this central debate within Greek culture: the conflict\nbetween philosophy and rhetoric, or better, between philosophers and\nrhetors. Philo displays a sound knowledge of rhetoric. His affinity\nwith Platonism impelled him to address very harsh critics of the\n\u201clesser\u201d rhetoric, that of sophists, who represent the\nopposite pole of his own thought (Filler 2016). Sophisteia,\nsophistry, is in Philo a frequent concept attached to a range of\nnegative meanings. But, as in Plato (where Socrates opposes the idea\nof a greater rhetoric to Gorgias\u2019 lesser rhetoric in the\nPhaedrus), in Philo we see the possibility of a positive use\nof rhetoric. For Philo, rhetoric is neither an activity nor an\nabstract ideal but a human reality, the nature of which is laid out in\nthe Bible. Moses is the man who saw God in the Sinai, but he by\nhimself would have been unable to speak to Pharaoh and persuade him to\nlet his people go. Moses needed the presence of Aaron in order to\nobtain what he sought. Moses represents the metaphysical truth, Aaron\nits implementation in reality, akin to the two faces of\nlogos: while the logos prophorikos is that of\ncommunication, the logos endiathetos is the internal world of\nthoughts, and each is impossible without the other. It can be added\nthat Abraham is said by Philo (Mut. 66) to have been the\n\u201cfather of the sounds\u201d, a strange expression that,\nalongside many similar allusions to music, shows that Philo was not\nthe philosopher of sight alone. Another path of research is that of\nparr\u00easia, a complex term of political origin that\nappeared in the context of the Athenian democracy. In literary and\nphilosophical texts, it means freedom of speech, frankness, and\nhonesty. For Philo, however, parr\u00easia is neither a\npolitical ideal nor an individual achievement, but something given by\nGod; and it must be used without harming relatives or friends.\n",
