Introduction and overview\n\nThe term \u2018doxography\u2019 has come to be applied in a much\nlarger sense than seems to have been intended by its creator Hermann\nDiels. This name for the genre, if we may misleadingly call it that,\nderives from the Latin neologism \u2018doxographi\u2019 used by\nDiels to indicate the authors of a rather strictly specified type of\nliterature studied and edited in his monumental Doxographi\nGraeci (\u2018Greek Doxographers\u2019) of 1879. His researches\nwere focused on writings concerned with the physical part of\nphilosophy (including principles, theology, cosmology, astronomy,\nmeteorology, biology and part of medicine). But today overviews in the\nfield of ethics are also called doxographical. And scholars speak of\n\u2018doxographies\u2019 to be found in the dialogues of Plato and\nthe treatises of Aristotle, although these are works in which issues\nof philosophy are addressed, with only ancillary discussion of the\nviews of others.\n\nThe following authors and main works, listed in chronological order,\nare representative of doxography in the broad as well as in\nthe narrower sense (a complete list of names and titles would\nbe\n impractical).[1]\n\n\n\nCicero, 1st c. BCE: one of our indispensable sources for (the debates\namong the) schools of Hellenistic philosophy, esp. Stoicism,\nEpicureanism, and Academic Skepticism: Academics (book two\ndeals with questions of epistemology from Stoic and Academic Skeptic\nangles); On the Chief Ends of Good and Evil; On the\nNature of the Gods (contrasting Epicurean and Stoic views on\nnature and the gods and criticizing them from the viewpoint of\nmoderate Skepticism); On Fate (hellenistic arguments pro and\ncontra determinism); On Duties (largely based on a treatise\nof the Middle Stoic Panaetius). (Broad)\n\n\nPhilodemus, 1st c. BCE: works more or less extant on charred papyrus\nscrolls: Arrangement of the Philosophers, esp. two books\ndealing with the Academic and Stoic schools from an institutional\nangle; also a polemical treatise On the Stoics. A section\nfrom his On Piety briefly dealing with the tenets of the\nphilosophers about the gods is closely parallel to a section in book\none of Cicero\u2019s On the Nature of the Gods; both\npassages printed in parallel columns in Diels 1879.\n(Broad)\n\n\nPs-Plutarch, 2nd c. CE: Placita (\u2018tenets\u2019,\n\u2018doctrines\u2019) dealing with physics in five books ranging\nfrom first principles to diseases and old age. Issues in physical\nphilosophy are presented in chapters which (as a rule) contrast the\ntenets of the philosophers and occasionally of some physicians and\nastronomers, in a systematic not a chronological sequence. As a rule\neach individual tenet is formulated in an extremely brief way. No\ninformation is provided about individuals later than 1st c. BCE. See\nbelow, section 2, on A\u00ebtius\u2019 Placita of which this\ntract is an epitome. Edited as left column of reconstructed\nA\u00ebtius in Diels 1879. (Narrow)\n\n\nArius Didymus, late 1st c. CE: smaller and larger fragments from works\ncited as On Schools, or as Abstract(s), in\ntheir present form mainly dealing with Stoic and Peripatetic physics\non the one hand (edited Diels\n 1879),[2]\n and Stoic and Peripatetic ethics (extant in Stobaeus, see below) on\nthe other. (Narrow)\n\n\nPlutarch, after 45 \u2013 after 120 CE: esp. polemical treatises\nagainst Epicureans and Stoics: That Epicurus Makes a Pleasant Life\nImpossible, Reply to Colotes, Is \u2018Live\nUnknown\u2019 a Wise Precept?, and On Stoic\nSelf-Contradictions, Against the Stoics on Common Conceptions.\n(Broad)\n\n\nClement of Alexandria, late 2nd c. CE, a Christian author:\nStromateis (\u2018Patchworks\u2019), numerous passages\nadducing, and explaining, the views of poets and prose-writers,\nphilosophers and others, on a great variety of issues.\n(Broad)\n\n\nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius, early 3rd c. CE, indispensable for the history\nof Greek, esp. Hellenistic, philosophy: Lives and Maxims of Those\nwho Have Distinguished themselves in Philosophy and the Doctrines of\nEach Sect, in ten books. As the title shows this work offers a\nblend of biography and doxography. Lay-out is according to\nphilosophical schools: e.g., book seven gives the common\ndogmata of the Stoic school in the life of its founder.\nRanges from the Seven Sages and the Presocratics to the Hellenistic\nschools up to the 2nd \u2013 1st c. BCE. (Broad)\n\n\nHippolytus, early 3rd c. CE, a Christian author, Refutation of All\nHeresies: important esp. as source for Presocratic doctrines (and\nfragments!) (Osborne 1987, Mansfeld 1992b). Book one edited Diels\n1879. (Narrow, more or less)\n\n\nPs-Galen, Philosophical History, date uncertain (3rd-5th c.\nCE?): mostly a sorry epitome of Ps-Plutarch Placita. Edited\nDiels 1879, in part Jas 2018. (Narrow)\n\n\nStobaeus, 5th c. CE: Anthology, of which in the first two\nbooks (Eclogae) among other invaluable excerpts chunks of\nA\u00ebtius (see below, section 2) are preserved; edited as right column\nfor A\u00ebtius in Diels 1879, and also containing large and smaller\nabstracts from Arius Didymus (see above). (Broad) (Arius\nDidymus) and (narrow) (A\u00ebtius).\n\n\nTheodoret, 5th c. CE, Christian bishop: Cure for the Diseases of\nthe Greeks, contains excerpts from A\u00ebtius (see below,\nsection 2) quoted at bottom of A\u00ebtian page in Diels 1879 and in\nMansfeld & Runia 2020. (Narrow)\n\n",
