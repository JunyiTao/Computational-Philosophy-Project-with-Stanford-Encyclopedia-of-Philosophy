    "main_text": "Quantum Mind || Applying Quantum Concepts to Mental Systems\n4.1 Applying Quantum Concepts to Mental Systems\n\nToday there is accumulating evidence in the study of consciousness\nthat quantum concepts like complementarity, entanglement, dispersive\nstates, and non-Boolean logic play significant roles in mental\nprocesses. Corresponding quantum-inspired approaches address purely\nmental (psychological) phenomena using formal features also employed\nin quantum physics, but without involving the full-fledged framework\nof quantum mechanics or quantum field theory. The term \u201cquantum\ncognition\u201d has been coined to refer to this new area of\nresearch. Perhaps a more appropriate characterization would be\nnon-commutative structures in cognition. \n\nOn the surface, this seems to imply that the brain activity correlated\nwith those mental processes is in fact governed by quantum physics.\nThe quantum brain approaches discussed in\n Section 3\n represent attempts that have been proposed along these lines. But is\nit necessarily true that quantum features in psychology imply quantum\nphysics in the brain? \n\nA formal move to incorporate quantum behavior in mental systems,\nwithout referring to quantum brain activity, is based on a state space\ndescription of mental systems. If mental states are defined on the\nbasis of cells of a neural state space partition, then this partition\nneeds to be well tailored to lead to robustly defined states. Ad hoc\nchosen partitions will generally create incompatible descriptions\n(Atmanspacher and beim Graben 2007) and states may become entangled\n(beim Graben et al. 2013). \n\nThis implies that quantum brain dynamics is not the only possible\nexplanation of quantum features in mental systems. Assuming that\nmental states arise from partitions of neural states in such a way\nthat statistical neural states are co-extensive with individual mental\nstates, the nature of mental processes depends strongly on the kind of\npartition chosen. If the partition is not properly constructed, it is\nlikely that mental states and observables show features that resemble\nquantum behavior although the correlated brain activity may be\nentirely classical: quantum mind without quantum brain.\n\nIntuitively, it is not difficult to understand why non-commuting\noperations or non-Boolean logic should be relevant, even inevitable,\nfor mental systems that have nothing to do with quantum physics.\nSimply speaking, the non-commutativity of operations means nothing\nelse than that the sequence, in which operations are applied, matters\nfor the final result. And non-Boolean logic refers to propositions\nthat may have unsharp truth values beyond yes or no, shades of\nplausibility or credibility as it were. Both versions obviously abound\nin psychology and cognitive science (and in everyday life).\nPylkk\u00e4nen (2015) has even suggested to use this intuitive\naccessibility of mental quantum features for a better conceptual grasp\nof quantum physics. \n\nThe particular strength of the idea of generalizing quantum theory\nbeyond quantum physics is that it provides a formal framework which\nboth yields a transparent well-defined link to conventional quantum\nphysics and has been used to describe a number of concrete\npsychological applications with surprisingly detailed theoretical and\nempirical results. Corresponding approaches fall under the third\ncategory mentioned in\n Section 3:\n further developments or generalizations of quantum theory.\n\nOne rationale for the focus on psychological phenomena is that their\ndetailed study is a necessary precondition for further questions as to\ntheir neural correlates. Therefore, the investigation of mental\nquantum features resists the temptation to reduce them (within\nscenario A) all-too quickly to neural activity. There are several\nkinds of psychological phenomena which have been addressed in the\nspirit of mental quantum features so far: (i) decision processes, (ii)\norder effects, (iii) bistable perception, (iv) learning, (v) semantic\nnetworks, (vi) quantum agency,and (vii) super-quantum entanglement\ncorrelations. These topics will be outlined in some more detail in the\nfollowing\n Section 4.2.\n It is a distinguishing aspect of these approaches that they have led\nto well-defined and specific theoretical models with empirical\nconsequences and novel predictions. A second point worth mentioning is\nthat by now there are a number of research groups worldwide (rather\nthan solitary actors) studying quantum ideas in cognition, partly even\nin collaborative efforts. For about a decade there have been regular\ninternational conferences with proceedings for the exchange of new\nresults and ideas, and target articles, special issues, and monographs\nhave been devoted to basic frameworks and new developments (Khrennikov\n1999, Atmanspacher et al. 2002, Busemeyer and Bruza 2012,\nHaven and Khrennikov 2013, Wendt 2015).\n\n",
