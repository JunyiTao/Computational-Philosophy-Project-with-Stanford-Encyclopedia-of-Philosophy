    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction \n\nComputational philosophy is not an area or subdiscipline of philosophy\nbut a set of computational techniques applicable across many\nphilosophical areas. The idea is simply to apply computational\nmodeling and techniques to advance philosophical discovery,\nexploration and argument. One should not therefore expect a sharp\nbreak between computational and non-computational philosophy, nor a\nsharp break between computational philosophy and other computational\ndisciplines.\n\nThe past half-century has seen impressive advances in raw computer\npower as well as theoretical advances in automated theorem proving,\nagent-based modeling, causal and system dynamics, neural networks,\nmachine learning and data mining. What might contemporary\ncomputational technologies and techniques have to offer in advancing\nour understanding of issues in epistemology, ethics, social and\npolitical philosophy, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind,\nphilosophy of science, or philosophy of religion? Suggested by Leibniz\nand with important precursors in the history of formal logic, the idea\nis to apply new computational advances within long-standing areas of\nphilosophical interest.\n\nComputational philosophy is not the philosophy of\ncomputation, an area that asks about the nature of computation itself.\nAlthough applicable and informative regarding artificial intelligence,\ncomputational philosophy is not the philosophy of artificial\nintelligence. Nor is it an umbrella term for the questions about the\nsocial impact of computer use explored for example in philosophy of\ninformation, philosophy of technology, and computer ethics. More\ngenerally, there is no \u201cof\u201d that computational philosophy\ncan be said to be the philosophy of. Computational philosophy\nrepresents not an isolated topic area but the widespread application\nof whatever computer techniques are available across the full range of\nphilosophical topics. Techniques employed in computational philosophy\nmay draw from standard computer programming and software engineering,\nincluding aspects of artificial intelligence, neural networks, systems\nscience, complex adaptive systems, and a variety of computer modeling\nmethods. As a growing set of methodologies, it includes the prospect\nof computational textual analysis, big data analysis, and other\ntechniques as well. Its field of application is equally broad,\nunrestricted within the traditional discipline and domain of\nphilosophy.\n\nThis article is an introduction to computational philosophy rather\nthan anything like a complete survey. The goal is to offer a handful\nof suggestive examples across computational techniques and fields of\nphilosophical application.\n",
