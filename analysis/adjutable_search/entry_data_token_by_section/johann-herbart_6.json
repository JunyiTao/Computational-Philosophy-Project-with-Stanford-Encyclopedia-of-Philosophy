    "main_text": "Psychology || Geist and Gem\u00fcth: the life of the mind\n3.5 Geist and Gem\u00fcth: the life of the mind\nHerbart is of course very concerned to demonstrate the superiority\nof his system over other, traditional conceptions of mind (SW VI: 53).\nIn particular, he wants to head off critics of mathematical psychology\nwho argue that \u201cmathematics merely determines quanta, whereas\npsychology deals primarily with qualities\u201d (LPs [1850]: 29). He\ntherefore turns from the statics and mechanics of Geist (soul\nas representing) to the special theory of the\n\u201cGem\u00fct\u201d (soul as feeling and desiring), in\norder to show how the latter can be incorporated into the former (LPs\n[1850]: 29; SW VI: 56, f.).\nFor Herbart, Gem\u00fct\u2014which I will here translate\nas \u201cdisposition\u201d\u2014has its seat within Geist;\nput another way, it is our state of mind. Hence,\n\nfeeling and desire are in the first place states\n[Zust\u00e4nde] of representations, to wit, for the most\npart, mutable states thereof (LPs [1850]: 29)\n\n when we feel, something is always simultaneously\nrepresented, and the feeling is contained in that\nrepresentation (LPs [1850]: \n32).[49]\n Again, when we desire, we always also\nrepresent that which we desire (cf. Aristotle, Metaphysics\n\u039b7, 1072a26, ff.).\nHerbart develops his theory of disposition on the basis of\npersisting (stehende) and rising (steigende)\nrepresentations (SW VI:\n 57).[50]\n That is, all dispositions must ultimately\nbe explicable in terms of persisting or rising representations, and\nnothing else. Taking first the case of a representation (or\nrepresentational series) R that stands still in\nconsciousness, its persistence may be due to the simultaneous and\ncountervailing forces exerted on it by rising and inhibiting\nrepresentations, \\(R_r\\) and \\(R_i\\), respectively. Hence we\nwill feel the state of R as a \u201ccompression\n[Klemmung]\u201d between \\(R_r\\) and \\(R_i\\) (SW VI: 64;\n58; cf. LPs (1850): 31) and such states are \u201cunpleasant\nfeelings\u201d (SW VI: 59). On the other hand, if a\nrepresentation R rises, then it may encounter an obstacle\nthat is not strong enough to prevent it from rising, or it may be\naided by advantageous forces (SW VI: 58\u20139). Since these forces\naffect the real activity of representing, Herbart argues that we\ncannot be unconscious of their pressure upon or aid of R:\n\nBut these [impingements upon R] are not\n[themselves] objects of representing, but merely\nthe way in which the representing is happening; these\ndeterminations of consciousness, insofar as it transcends the mere\nrepresenting as such, must be called \u201cfeelings\u201d\n[Gef\u00fchle]. (SW VI: 58)\nWhat then, on Herbart\u2019s view, is desire?\n\u201cFeelings\u201d accompany representations that, as they rise,\nbecome continuously more \u201ceffective\u201d (SW VI: 59). By\n\u201ceffective\u201d, he means that the representation in question\ndetermines more and more representations akin to it, while at the same\ntime inhibiting those that are not (SW VI: 59). \u201cDesire\u201d,\nthen, is the consciousness of a representation\u2019s rising struggle\ntowards ever-brighter light, and of its corresponding\n\u201ctension\u201d as it works itself up and over obstacles (SW VI:\n59).\nHerbart extends his interpretation of feeling and desire to the\nphenomena of affect[51]\n and passion, the \u201cstrongest\nexpressions of feeling and desire [respectively]\u201d (SW VI:\n75). In both cases it is important to see that the force of\nboth affect and passion inheres in the representations themselves;\nwhen these forces are compressed or relaxed beyond the static point,\nthey produce tension within the masses of representations, which\nmanifests itself as affect (Weiss 1928: 90).  Both result from\nmovements, not of individual representations, but of fused\nrepresentational masses well past their point of equilibrium (SW VI:\n75; cf. Weiss 1928: 89). Thus, if a \u201clarger amount of actual\nrepresentation is raised into consciousness than can subsist there\n[all at once]\u201d, the result is an \u201cebullient\u201d affect\n(SW VI: 75).[52]\n By contrast, if a larger mass is banished\nbeneath the limen, the psychic barometer falls as well,\nresulting in a \u201cmelting\u201d affect (SW VI: 75). Just as low\natmospheric pressure provokes stormy weather, so too the\ndisappearance of a representational mass loosens and unleashes those masses\nthat remain (SW VI: 75\u20136). These suddenly far exceed the static\npoint, their violent expression taking the form, e.g., of rage or\nfear (SW VI: 75\u20136). This also explains why affects are always\ntransient moods, since representations always strive to return over\ntime to a state of equilibrium (SW VI:\n75).[53]\n",
