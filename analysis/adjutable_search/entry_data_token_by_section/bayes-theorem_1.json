    "main_text": "Special Forms of Bayes' Theorem\n2. Special Forms of Bayes' Theorem\n\n\nBayes' Theorem can be expressed in a variety of forms that are useful\nfor different purposes. One version employs what Rudolf Carnap called\nthe relevance quotient or probability ratio (Carnap\n1962, 466).  This is the factor PR(H,\nE) =\nPE(H)/P(H)\nby which H's unconditional probability must be multiplied to\nget its probability conditional on E. Bayes' Theorem is\nequivalent to a simple symmetry principle for probability ratios.\n\n\n\n(1.4)\nProbability Ratio Rule.\n\n\n\nPR(H, E) = \nPR(E, H)\n\n\n\n\n The term on the right provides one measure of the degree to which\nH predicts E.  If we think of P(E) as\nexpressing the \"baseline\" predictability of E given the\nbackground information codified in P, and of\nPH(E) as E's\npredictability when H is added to this background, then\nPR(E, H) captures the degree to\nwhich knowing H makes E more or less predictable\nrelative to the baseline: PR(E, H) =\n0 means that H categorically predicts ~E;\nPR(E, H) = 1 means that adding\nH does not alter the baseline prediction at all;\nPR(E, H) =\n1/P(E) means that H categorically\npredicts E.  Since P(E)) =\nPT(E)) where\nT is any truth of logic, we can think of (1.4) as\ntelling us that\n\nThe probability of a hypothesis conditional on a body of data is\nequal to the unconditional probability of the hypothesis multiplied by\nthe degree to which the hypothesis surpasses a tautology as a\npredictor of the data.\n\n\n In our J. Doe example, PR(H, E) is\nobtained by comparing the predictability of senior status given that\nJ. Doe died in 2000 to its predictability given no information\nwhatever about his or her mortality.  Dividing the former \"prediction\nterm\" by the latter yields PR(H, E) =\nPH(E)/P(E) =\n0.57/0.06036 = 9.44.  Thus, as a predictor of senior status in 2000,\nknowing that J. Doe died is more than nine times better than not\nknowing whether she lived or died.\n\n Another useful form of Bayes' Theorem is the Odds Rule.  In\nthe jargon of bookies, the \"odds\" of a hypothesis is its probability\ndivided by the probability of its negation: O(H) =\nP(H)/P(~H). So, for example, a\nracehorse whose odds of winning a particular race are 7-to-5 has a\n7/12 chance of winning and a 5/12 chance of losing. To\nunderstand the difference between odds and probabilities it helps to\nthink of probabilities as fractions of the distance between\nthe probability of a contradiction and that of a tautology, so that\nP(H) = p means that H is p\ntimes as likely to be true as a tautology. In contrast, writing\nO(H) = [P(H) \u2212\nP(F)]/[P(T)\n\u2212 P(H)]  (where F is some\nlogical contradiction) makes it clear that O(H)\nexpresses this same quantity as the ratio of the amount by which\nH's probability exceeds that of a contradiction to the\namount by which it is exceeded by that of a tautology. Thus, the\ndifference between \"probability talk\" and \"odds talk\" corresponds to\nthe difference between saying \"we are two thirds of the way there\" and\nsaying \"we have gone twice as far as we have yet to go.\"\n\n The analogue of the probability ratio is the odds ratio\nOR(H, E) =\nOE(H)/O(H),\nthe factor by which H's unconditional odds must be multiplied\nto obtain its odds conditional on E. Bayes' Theorem is\nequivalent to the following fact about odds ratios:\n\n\n\n(1.5)\nOdds Ratio Rule.\n\n\n \nOR(H, E) =\nPH(E)/P~H(E)\n\n\n\n\n Notice the similarity between (1.4) and (1.5). While each employs a\ndifferent way of expressing probabilities, each shows how\nits expression for H's probability conditional on\nE can be obtained by multiplying its expression for\nH's unconditional probability by a factor involving inverse\nprobabilities.\n\n The quantity LR(H, E) =\nPH(E)/P~H(E)\nthat appears in (1.5) is the likelihood ratio of H\ngiven E. In testing situations like the one described in\nExample 1, the likelihood ratio is the test's true positive rate\ndivided by its false positive rate: LR =\nsensitivity/(1 \u2212 specificity). As with the probability\nratio, we can construe the likelihood ratio as a measure of the degree\nto which H predicts E. Instead of comparing\nE's probability given H with its unconditional\nprobability, however, we now compare it with its probability\nconditional on ~H.  LR(H,\nE) is thus the degree to which the hypothesis surpasses its\nnegation as a predictor of the data.  Once more, Bayes' Theorem tells\nus how to factor conditional probabilities into unconditional\nprobabilities and measures of predictive power.\n\nThe odds of a hypothesis conditional on a body of data is equal\nto the unconditional odds of the hypothesis multiplied by the degree\nto which it surpasses its negation as a predictor of the data.\n\n\n In our running J. Doe example, LR(H,\nE) is obtained by comparing the predictability of senior\nstatus given that J.  Doe died in 2000 to its predictability given\nthat he or she lived out the year.  Dividing the former \"prediction\nterm\" by the latter yields LR(H, E)\n=\nPH(E)/P~H(E)\n= 0.57/0.056 = 10.12.  Thus, as a predictor of senior status in 2000,\nknowing that J. Doe died is more than ten times better than knowing\nthat he or she lived.  \n\n The similarities between the \"probability ratio\" and \"odds ratio\"\nversions of Bayes' Theorem can be developed further if we express\nH's probability as a multiple of the probability of some\nother hypothesis H* using the relative probability\nfunction B(H, H*) =\nP(H)/P(H*).  It should be clear\nthat B generalizes both P and O since\nP(H) = B(H, T) and\nO(H) = B(H, ~H). By comparing\nthe conditional and unconditional values of B we obtain the\nBayes' Factor:\n\nBR(H, H*; E) =\nBE(H,\nH*)/B(H, H*) =\n[PE(H)/PE(H*)]/\n[P(H)/P(H*)].\n \n\n We can also generalize the likelihood ratio by setting\nLR(H, H*; E) =\nPH(E)/PH*(E).\nThis compares E's predictability on the basis of H\nwith its predictability on the basis of H*.  We can use these\ntwo quantities to formulate an even more general form of Bayes'\nTheorem.\n\n\n\n(1.6)\nBayes' Theorem (General Form)\n\n\n \nBR(H, H*; E) =\nLR(H, H*; E)\n\n\n\n\n The message of (1.6) is this:\n\nThe ratio of probabilities for two hypotheses conditional on a\nbody of data is equal to the ratio their unconditional probabilities\nmultiplied by the degree to which the first hypothesis surpasses the\nsecond as a predictor of the data.\n\n\n The various versions of Bayes' Theorem differ only with respect to\nthe functions used to express unconditional probabilities\n(P(H), O(H), B(H)) and\nin the likelihood term used to represent predictive power\n(PR(E, H),\nLR(H, E),\nLR(H, H*; E)).  In each\ncase, though, the underlying message is the same:\n\nconditional probability = unconditional probability \u00d7\n predictive power\n\n\n (1.2) \u2013 (1.6) are multiplicative forms of Bayes' Theorem that use\ndivision to compare the disparities between unconditional and\nconditional probabilities.  Sometimes these comparisons are best\nexpressed additively by replacing ratios with differences.\nThe following table gives the additive analogue of each ratio measure.\n\n\nTable 1\n\nRatio\nDifference\n\n\nProbability Ratio\u00a0\n\nPR(H, E)\n= PE(H)/P(H)\nProbability Difference\n\nPD(H, E) =\nPE(H) \u2212\nP(H) \n\nOdds Ratio\u00a0\n\nOR(H, E) =\nOE(H)/O(H)\nOdds Difference\u00a0\n\nOD(H, E) =\nOE(H) \u2212\nO(H)\n\n\nBayes' Factor\u00a0\n\nBR(H, H*; E) =\nBE(H,\nH*)/B(H, H*)\nBayes' Difference\u00a0\n\nBD(H, H*; E) =\nBE(H, H*) \u2212\nB(H, H*)\n\n\n\n\n We can use Bayes' theorem to obtain additive analogues of (1.4) \u2013\n(1.6), which are here displayed along with their multiplicative\ncounterparts:\n\n\nTable 2\n\n\nRatio\nDifference\n\n\n(1.4)\n\n\u00a0PR(H, E)\n= PR(E, H)\n= PH(E)/P(E)\n\n\u00a0PD(H, E)\n= P(H) [PR(E, H) \u2212 1]\n\n\n\n(1.5)\n\n\u00a0OR(H, E)\n= LR(H, E)\n= PH(E)/P~H(E)\n\n\u00a0OD(H, E) = O(H)\n[OR(H, E) \u2212 1]\n\n\n(1.6)\n\n \u00a0BR(H, H*; E) =\nLR(H, H*; E) =\nPH(E)/PH*(E)\n\n\u00a0BD(H, H*; E) =\nB(H, H*) [BR(H,\nH*; E) \u2212 1]\n\n\n\n\n Notice how each additive measure is obtained by multiplying\nH's unconditional probability, expressed on the relevant\nscale, P, O or B, by the associated\nmultiplicative measure diminished by 1.\n\n While the results of this section are useful to anyone who employs\nthe probability calculus, they have a special relevance for\nsubjectivist or \"Bayesian\" approaches to statistics,\nepistemology, and inductive\n inference.[5]\n Subjectivists lean heavily on conditional probabilities in their\ntheory of evidential support and their account of empirical\nlearning. Given that Bayes' Theorem is the single most important fact\nabout conditional probabilities, it is not at all surprising that it\nshould figure prominently in subjectivist methodology.\n",
