    "main_text": "Environmental Ethics and Politics || Feminism and the Environment\n3.2 Feminism and the Environment\n\nBroadly speaking, a feminist issue is any that contributes in some way\nto understanding the oppression of women. Feminist theories attempt to\nanalyze women\u2019s oppression, its causes and consequences, and\nsuggest strategies and directions for women\u2019s liberation. By the\nmid 1970s, feminist writers had raised the issue of whether\npatriarchal modes of thinking encouraged not only widespread\ninferiorizing and colonizing of women, but also of people of colour,\nanimals and nature. Sheila Collins (1974), for instance, argued that\nmale-dominated culture or patriarchy is supported by four interlocking\npillars: sexism, racism, class exploitation, and ecological\ndestruction.\n\nEmphasizing the importance of feminism to the environmental movement\nand various other liberation movements, some writers, such as Ynestra\nKing (1989a and 1989b), argue that the domination of women by men is\nhistorically the original form of domination in human society, from\nwhich all other hierarchies\u2014of rank, class, and political\npower\u2014flow. For instance, human exploitation of nature may be\nseen as a manifestation and extension of the oppression of women, in\nthat it is the result of associating nature with the female, which had\nbeen already inferiorized and oppressed by the male-dominating\nculture. But within the plurality of feminist positions, other\nwriters, such as Val Plumwood (1993), understand the oppression of\nwomen as only one of the many parallel forms of oppression sharing and\nsupported by a common ideological structure, in which one party (the\ncolonizer, whether male, white or human) uses a number of conceptual\nand rhetorical devices to privilege its interests over that of the\nother party (the colonized: whether female, people of colour, or\nanimals). Facilitated by a common structure, seemingly diverse forms\nof oppression can mutually reinforce each other (Warren 1987, 1990,\n1994, Cheney 1989, and Plumwood 1993).\n\nNot all feminist theorists would call that common underlying\noppressive structure \u201candrocentric\u201d or\n\u201cpatriarchal\u201d. But it is generally agreed that core\nfeatures of the structure include dichotomies, hierarchical thinking,\nand a \u201clogic of domination\u201d, which are typical of, if not\nessential to, male-chauvinism. These patterns of thinking and\nconceptualizing the world, many feminist theorists argue, also nourish\nand sustain other forms of chauvinism including human-chauvinism\n(i.e., anthropocentrism), which is responsible for much human\nexploitation of, and destructiveness towards, nature. Writers comment\non dichotomous forms of thinking which depict the world in polar\nopposite terms, such as male/female, masculinity/femininity,\nreason/emotion, freedom/necessity, active/passive, mind/body,\npure/soiled, white/coloured, civilized/primitive,\ntranscendent/immanent, human/animal, culture/nature. When these\ndichotomies involve hierarchy and domination they are often labelled\n\"dualisms\". Under the influence of such dualisms all the first items\nin these contrasting pairs are assimilated with each other, and all\nthe second items are likewise linked with each other. For example, the\nmale is seen to be associated with the rational, active, creative,\nCartesian human mind, and civilized, orderly, transcendent culture;\nwhereas the female is regarded as tied to the emotional, passive,\ndetermined animal body, and primitive, disorderly, immanent nature.\nThese interlocking dualisms are not just descriptive dichotomies,\naccording to the feminists, but involve a prescriptive privileging of\none side of the opposed items over the other. Dualism confers\nsuperiority to everything on the male side, but inferiority to\neverything on the female side. The \u201clogic of domination\u201d\nthen dictates that those on the superior side (e.g., men, rational\nbeings, humans) are morally entitled to dominate and utilize those on\nthe inferior side (e.g., women, beings lacking in rationality,\nnon-humans) as mere means.\n\nThe problem with dualistic modes of thinking, however, is not just\nthat they are epistemically unreliable. It is not just that the\ndominating party often falsely sees the dominated party as lacking (or\npossessing) the allegedly superior (or inferior) qualities, or that\nthe dominated party often internalizes false stereotypes of itself\ngiven by its oppressors, or that stereotypical thinking often\noverlooks salient and important differences among individuals. More\nimportant, according to feminist analyses, the very premise of\nprescriptive dualism\u2014the valuing of attributes of one polarized\nside and the devaluing of those of the other, the idea that domination\nand oppression can be justified by appealing to attributes like\nmasculinity, rationality, being civilized or developed, etc.\u2014is\nitself problematic.\n\nFeminism represents a radical challenge for environmental thinking,\npolitics, and traditional social ethical perspectives. It promises to\nlink environmental questions with wider social problems concerning\nvarious kinds of discrimination and exploitation, and fundamental\ninvestigations of human psychology. However, whether there are\nconceptual, causal or merely contingent connections among the\ndifferent forms of oppression and liberation remains a contested issue\n(see Green 1994). The term \u201cecofeminism\u201d (first coined by\nFran\u00e7oise d\u2019Eaubonne in 1974) or \u201cecological\nfeminism\u201d was for a time generally applied to any view that\ncombines environmental advocacy with feminist analysis. However,\nbecause of the varieties of, and disagreements among, feminist\ntheories, the label may be too wide to be informative (see the entry\non\n feminist environmental philosophy).\n",
