    "main_text": "Abstract Algebra\n2. Abstract Algebra\n\nElementary algebra fixes some domain, typically the reals or complex\nnumbers, and works with the equations holding within that domain.\nAbstract or modern algebra reverses this picture by\nfixing some set \\(A\\) of equations and studying those domains for\nwhich those equations are identities. For example if we take the set\nof all identities expressible with the operations of addition,\nsubtraction, and multiplication and constants 0 and 1 that hold for\nthe integers, then the algebras in which those equations hold\nidentically are exactly the commutative rings with identity.\n\nHistorically the term modern algebra came from the title of the first\nthree editions of van der Waerden\u2019s classic text of that name,\nrenamed simply \u201cAlgebra\u201d for its fourth edition in 1955.\nVolume 1 treated groups, rings, general fields, vector spaces, well\norderings, and real fields, while Volume 2 considered mainly linear\nalgebra, algebras (as vector spaces with a compatible multiplication),\nrepresentation theory, ideal theory, integral algebraic elements,\nalgebraic functions, and topological algebra. On the one hand modern\nalgebra has since gone far beyond this curriculum, on the other this\nconsiderable body of material is already more than what can be assumed\nas common knowledge among graduating Ph.D. students in mathematics,\nfor whom the typical program is too short to permit mastering all this\nmaterial in parallel with focusing on their area of\nspecialization.\n\nA core feature of abstract algebra is the existence of domains where\nfamiliar laws fail to hold. A striking example is commutativity of\nmultiplication, which as we noted in the introduction need not hold\nfor the multiplication of an arbitrary group, even so simple a group\nas the six permutations of three letters.\n",
