    "main_text": "Game Theory and Contractarianism || Evolutionary Approaches to the Social Contract\n4.2 Evolutionary Approaches to the Social Contract\n\nHaving focused on the use of bargaining theory in philosophical\nanalyses of the social contract, we will now briefly turn our\nattention to the relevance of evolutionary game theory to this task.\nRecall that evolutionary game theory is the formal approach to\nmodeling how the distribution of traits in a population will evolve\nover time when those traits determine how the agents who possess them\nwill interact. Gaus (2010) and Muldoon (2016) are two recent works\nthat draw on informal evolutionary models in order to show how and why\nthe terms of a social contract might evolve over time to accommodate a\ndiverse polity. While, taking a more formal approach, Alexander (2007)\nexplores how the equilibria that characterize prosocial norms in\nsocial networks evolve over time. It is the works of Brian Skyrms\n(1996 [2014], 2004), though, that have been the most influential in\nbringing evolutionary game theory to bear on the social contract.\n\nOne of Skyrms\u2019 signature uses of evolutionary game theory is to\nexplain the origins of various \u201cfair\u201d solutions to the\nNash bargaining problem (1996 [2014]: Chapter 1). As we have seen\nabove, different axiomatic solution concepts can recommend different\nsolutions to the same bargaining problem. However, even if one\nendorses the arguments in favor of a particular solution concept, this\ndoesn\u2019t yet show that the actual claimants engaged in a\nbargaining problem would tend to follow this solution. This is because\na typical bargaining problem will often have a large number of\nequilibria each of which is likely to be more favorable to some and\nless favorable to others. Accordingly, one might doubt that actual\nclaimants could settle into any equilibrium, let alone an equilibrium\nthat characterizes an outcome we would regard as fair.\n\nTo gain traction on this problem Skyrms considers a simple but\nnontrivial 3-piece Nash Demand Game that is structurally\nsimilar to the Extended Wine Problem of\n Figure 8.\n In this now familiar game a pair of agents vie for shares of a good.\nEach issues a claim and receives a payoff equivalent to her claim when\nthe pair\u2019s claims are compatible, and each receives nothing when\ntheir claims are incompatible. In Skyrms\u2019 version a claimant can\nissue a minimal claim, D, to 1/3 of the good; a maximal\nclaim, H, to 2/3 of the good; or a \u201cmiddle\u201d\nclaim, M, to 1/2 of it.\n [14]\n As Skyrms notes (1996 [2014: 4]), in games of this sort we tend to\nthink there is one outcome claimants ought to follow, namely, the fair\noutcome where each claims half of the good at stake. This corresponds\nto each side following M, and, as we saw earlier,\n(M,M) is an equilibrium of the game. But the\nquestion remains, why would claimants opt for the fair outcome when\nthere are other equilibria that might be preferable?\n\nOne answer to this question is that when agents repeatedly have to\ncome to agreements with one another over the division of a good, but\ncan only obtain a share of the good when they agree on a feasible\ndivision, agents who restrain themselves from pressing maximal claims\nare more likely to encounter other agents with whom feasible bargains\nare possible. In other words, as we saw in a slightly different\ncontext in section 2, in the long run the benefits from successfully\ncoming to terms with like-minded agents outweigh the foregone gains\nthat can occasionally be gotten by pressing for less equitable\ndivisions. Skyrms tests this rationale by applying a dynamic model of\nevolution, the replicator dynamic, to his Nash Demand Game.\n Figure 12\n illustrates a simplex that one can use to summarize this\ndynamic.\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Strategy Simplex for\nSkyrms\u2019s Nash Demand Game [An\n extended description of figure 12\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nEach point in the simplex corresponds to a particular mix of types of\nagents in the population that can represented by an ordered triplet\n\\((z_1,z_2,z_3),\\) where \\(z_1\\) is the fraction of the population\nthat follows D, \\(z_2\\) the fraction that follow M,\nand \\(z_3\\) the fraction that follow H. Points closer to a\nvertex of the simplex thus represent mixes where more agents follow\nthe strategy associated with that vertex. The replicator dynamic then\nsummarizes the evolution of population states where the fractions of\nrepresented strategies change over time in proportion to their\naverage reproductive fitness. Here a strategy\u2019s average\nreproductive fitness corresponds to its average payoff relative to the\naverage payoff of other strategies represented in the population at a\ngiven\n time.[15]\n To illustrate, in\n Figure 12,\n the point \\(z_0 = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}, \\frac{1}{3},\n\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) represents an initial state where \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)\nof the population follow D, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) follow\nM, and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) follow H. Given this starting\npoint, the replicator dynamic then traces an orbit starting\nat \\(z_0\\) that converges to \\(\\be_2 = (0,1,0),\\) the vertex point\nwhere the entire population follows the pure strategy M.\n\nBy applying the replicator dynamic across a wide swath of initial\nstates in the\n Figure 12\n simplex, Skyrms then showed that the fair outcome, \\(\\be_2,\\) where\neveryone presses equal claims, is the most likely to evolve. We\nreplicate Skyrms\u2019 experiment here.\n Figure 13\n depicts 200 orbits of the replicator dynamic starting from initial\npopulation states chosen at random from the\n Figure 12\n simplex.\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Replicator Dynamic Orbits of\nSkyrms\u2019s Nash Demand Game [An\n extended description of figure 13\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs this figure illustrates most initial distributions of claimant\ntypes eventually converge to an equilibrium where all agents follow\nM and press claims of 1/2. To use a technical term, we can\nsay that \\(\\be_2\\) has the largest basin of\n attraction.[16]\n To see why this is the case, we can consider how different pure\nstrategy types fare when agents of a population meet at random and\nengage in the Nash Demand Game. Agents who press claims of D\nalways arrive at feasible bargains, but in particular interactions\nthey never do as well as partners who press claims of M or\nH. On the other hand, agents who press claims of H\nonly arrive at feasible bargains when matched with agents who press\nminimal claims of D and can thus be exploited. Meanwhile,\nagents who press claims of M arrive at feasible bargains when\nmatched against either D-following partners or other\nM-following partners. On average, then, M-followers\ndo better than both D-followers and H-followers\nunless there are so many H-followers and so few\nM-followers in the population that in an individual encounter\nan M-follower is more likely to meet an H-follower\nthan either another M-follower or a\n D-follower.[17]\n Indeed, M is an evolutionarily stable strategy\n(Maynard Smith 1982) of this game. What this means is that, if\n\\(\\be_2\\) is the current population state so that M is the\nsole incumbent strategy, then \\(\\be_2\\) can repel any limited\ninvasion of some different mutant\n strategy.[18]\n\nIn some respects Skyrms\u2019 observation shows how Gauthier\u2019s\nargument for constrained maximization might have been strengthened by\ndrawing on resources from outside the confines of rational choice\ntheory. Indeed, Skyrms shows that the basin of attraction for the\nequitable equilibrium where all agents press claims of 1/2 expands\nwhen agents become more likely to interact with agents of their own\nstrategy type, as they might if they are somewhat able to recognize\nagents like themselves. For example,\n Figure 14\n depicts a series of orbits of a correlated replicator\ndynamic Skyrms uses to model such situations. In this dynamic, an\nagent meets a counterpart of the same pure strategy type with\nprobability .2 greater than the random chance probability of the\nordinary replicator\n dynamic.[19]\n And, as we can see, even with this relatively minor increase in the\nlikelihood of same type interactions, all of the modified\nreplicator dynamic orbits now converge to \\(\\be_2\\)\n .[20]\n\n\n\nFigure 14. Correlated Replicator Dynamic\nOrbits of Skyrms\u2019s Nash Demand Game [An\n extended description of figure 14\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAlternatively, Skyrms showed how evolved attachments to particular\nplaces or things, and more importantly the ability to signal\nthese attachments can help solve conflictual coordination problems\nlike the Nash Demand Game. In particular, Skyrms (1996 [2014]: chap.\n4) showed that by developing a primitive notion of property rights,\nagents involved in such games could correlate their behavior by\nplaying Hawk at home and Dove away from home, and thereby avoid the\nsorts of interactions that lead to conflict or to both agents\nabandoning a resource. At the end of the day, though, the evolutionary\ngame theory utilized by Skyrms can only lend so much support to a view\nlike Gauthier\u2019s. For one thing, the game Skyrms models assumes\nthat agents have fixed types and cannot revise their claims in light\nof the claims made by others. Furthermore, it is one thing to offer an\nexplanation of why a trait like fair division or constrained\nmaximization would evolve, or to show why this might be beneficial to\nboth individual agents and groups, but to show either of these is not\nnecessarily to show that constraining one\u2019s behavior is the\nrational course of action.\n",
