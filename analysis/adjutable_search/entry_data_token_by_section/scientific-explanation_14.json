    "main_text": "A Unificationist Account of Explanation || The Basic Idea\n5.1 The Basic Idea\n\nIn unificationist accounts of explanation developed by philosophers,\nscientific explanation is a matter of providing a unified account of a\nrange of different\n phenomena.[9]\n This idea is unquestionably intuitively appealing. Successful\nunification may exhibit connections or relationships between phenomena\npreviously thought to be unrelated and this seems to be something that\nwe expect good explanations to do. Moreover, theory unification has\nclearly played an important role in science. Paradigmatic examples\ninclude Newton\u2019s unification of terrestrial and celestial\ntheories of motion and Maxwell\u2019s unification of electricity and\nmagnetism. The key question, however, is whether (and which) intuitive\nnotions of unification can be made more precise in a way that allows\nus to recover the features that we think that good explanations should\npossess.\n\nMichael Friedman (1974) is an important early attempt to do this.\nFriedman\u2019s formulation of the unificationist idea was\nsubsequently shown to suffer from various technical problems (Kitcher\n1976) and subsequent development of the unificationist treatment of\nexplanation has been most closely associated with Philip Kitcher\n(especially Kitcher 1989).\n\nLet us begin by introducing some of Kitcher\u2019s technical\nvocabulary. A schematic sentence is a sentence in which some\nof the nonlogical vocabulary has been replaced by dummy letters. To\nuse Kitcher\u2019s examples, the sentence \u201cOrganisms homozygous\nfor the sickling allele develop sickle cell anemia\u201d is\nassociated with a number of schematic sentences including\n\u201cOrganisms homozygous for A develop P\u201d and\n\u201cFor all X if X is O and A then\nX is P\u201d. Filling instructions are\ndirections that specify how to fill in the dummy letters in schematic\nsentences. For example, filling instructions might tell us to replace\nA with the name of an allele and P with the name of a\nphenotypic trait in the first of the above schematic sentences.\nSchematic arguments are sequences of schematic sentences.\nClassifications describe which sentences in schematic\narguments are premises and conclusions and what rules of inference are\nused. An argument pattern is an ordered triple consisting of\na schematic argument, a set or sets of filling instructions, one for\neach term of the schematic argument, and a classification of the\nschematic argument. The more restrictions an argument pattern imposes\non the arguments that instantiate it, the more stringent it\nis said to be.\n\nRoughly speaking, Kitcher\u2019s guiding idea is that explanation is\na matter of deriving descriptions of many different phenomena by using\nas few and as stringent argument patterns as possible over and over\nagain-the fewer the patterns used, the more stringent they are, and\nthe greater the range of different conclusions derived, the more\nunified our explanations. Kitcher summarizes this view as follows:\n\n\nScience advances our understanding of nature by showing us how to\nderive descriptions of many phenomena, using the same pattern of\nderivation again and again, and in demonstrating this, it teaches us\nhow to reduce the number of facts we have to accept as ultimate.\n(Kitcher 1989: 432)\n\n\nKitcher does not propose a completely general theory of how the\nvarious considerations he describes\u2014number of conclusions,\nnumber of patterns and stringency of patterns\u2014are to be\ntraded-off against one another, but does suggest that it often will be\nclear enough what these considerations imply about the evaluation of\nparticular candidate explanations. His basic strategy is to attempt to\nshow that the derivations we regard as good or acceptable explanations\nare instances of patterns that, taken together, score better according\nto the criteria just described than the patterns instantiated by what\nwe regard as defective explanations. Following Kitcher, let us define\nthe explanatory store \\(E(K)\\) as the set of argument\npatterns that maximally unifies K, the set of beliefs accepted\nat a particular time in science. Showing that a particular derivation\nis a good or acceptable explanation is then a matter of showing that\nit belongs to the explanatory store.\n",
