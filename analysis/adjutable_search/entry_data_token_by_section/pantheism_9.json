    "main_text": "The infinity / eternity / necessity of the universe\n10. The infinity / eternity / necessity of the universe\n\nHistorically the majority of pantheists have regarded the universe as\nInfinite, metaphysically perfect, necessarily existent, and eternal\n(or some subset thereof) and\u2014taking these attributes as the\ncharacteristic marks of divinity\u2014that has formed one very\nimportant reason for thinking that the universe itself is in fact\nGod.\n\nIn more recent times, however, there have arisen naturalistic or\nscientific forms of pantheism which reject or are neutral about these\ncharacteristics and, while they remove one important set of reasons\nfor thinking the cosmos divine, so long as others remain, the\namputation in itself seems insufficient reason to refuse the label\n\u2018pantheist\u2019 to such views. Any methodology which limits\nitself to empirical science will presumably find it hard to attribute\nanything like infinitude or necessary existence to the cosmos, while\napproaches which do find a role for such features will need to be\ncareful that they understand them in an appropriate fashion. (For\nexample, it is doubtful that mere infinite extent, or infinite\ndivisibility, in space and time would be sufficient to merit that the\nuniverse be called divine.) But with these caveats aside the pantheist\nis not without arguments for believing that the universe as a whole\ndisplays marks of metaphysical perfection.\n\nThe earliest arguments for such a view are to be found in the\npre-Socratic philosopher Anaximander who held that the universe\nemerges from what he termed \u2018to apeiron,\u2019 a\ncomplex notion which may be rendered as the infinite, the boundless or\nthe indefinite. Anaximander\u2019s thought seems to have been that\nthe ground by which all qualitative characteristics are explained must\nitself lack any determination. Insofar as we can construct his\nreasons, he argued that some such boundless potentiality was need to\nensure the continual coming to be and passing away in the world that\ncharacterises the passing of time. As something thus immortal and\nindestructible, Anaximander concluded that the infinite was also\ndivine (Aristotle, Physics, 203b).\n\nIt is notable that much of the same reasoning that theists employ in\nthe Kalaam cosmological argument for the existence of God may be used\nfor the universe itself. If we inquire into the origin of the\nuniverse, it may be suggested (1) that it simply began without reason,\n(2) that it was somehow self-creating, or (3) that its origin requires\na prior cause which in turn calls for an infinite causal chain. Each\nof these answers has sufficient problems such that one might well\nprefer to argue instead, (4) that the universe in fact exists\nnecessarily.\n\nBut perhaps the most commonly used argument among pantheists has been\nthe ontological argument. As employed by classical theism this line of\nargument has been much criticised, but the forms in which it has been\nput forward by pantheists (such as Spinoza and Hegel) are\ninterestingly different. On their way of thinking, the more perfect an\nidea becomes the less room there remains for any gap between it and\nits instantiation, but no idea becomes perfect simply by defining\nitself to be so. This can be shown only by a full development of its\ncontent amounting to nothing less than a complete philosophical system\n(Harrelson 2009).\n",
