This section demonstrates the range of that work by briefly\npresenting the use of phenomenology, existentialism, Deleuze and\nGuattari, and psychoanalysis in critical disability theory. Of course,\nthis section is not exhaustive.\n\nPhenomenology, including questions of ontology, hermeneutics, and life\nwriting, is one critical approach taken within disability studies. For\ninstance, Tanya Titchkosky and Rod Michalko argue that framing\ndisability as a \u201cproblem\u201d generates a restrictive\ndiscourse, specifically, the \u201crequirement for explanation and\namelioration, but little else\u201d (2012: 127). They use a\nphenomenological approach to analyze this framing, which otherwise\ngoes \u201ccompletely unexamined\u201d (ibid.). The authors\nwrite, \n\n\nThis approach permits us to ask, what sort of problem do contemporary\ntimes need disability to be? And, what is the meaning of human\nembodiment that grounds the unquestioned status of disability as a\nproblem? (ibid.) \n\n\nPhenomenology thus allows Titchkosky and Michalko to push back against\nwhat Edmund Husserl refers to as \u201cruling concealment\u201d and\nto take advantage of a politically powerful alliance between\nphenomenology and disability studies that uses disability as the\n\u201cscene where we can frame how we experience embodied\nexistence\u201d (2012: 141).\n\nLife writing is a practice informed by phenomenology. Susannah B.\nMintz contributes significantly to literature on disability and life\nwriting (e.g., 2007). She describes a \u201cphenomenological\nturn\u201d in disability studies, which reconnects analyses to the\nbody itself. Mintz seeks to push this opportunity further by\ntheorizing the skin and touch, radicalizing mindfulness and ethics of\ncare (2016).\n\nPhenomenology is used to counter dominant discourses in medicine, with\nsignificant impact on discussions of illness and health. Havi Carel\nhas written extensively on illness, life, and death from a\nphenomenological perspective, tackling questions of happiness, the\nusefulness of phenomenology in medicine, and the experience of illness\n(2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2016). Kevin Aho focuses primarily on\nphenomenology and mental health and launches new ways of thinking\nabout, for example, medicalization (2008), the body (Aho & Aho\n2008), and depression (2013). Maureen Connolly, likewise, frequently\nturns to phenomenology in her analyses, including work on autism\n(2008) and embodiment (2001; Connolly & Craig 2002).\n\nAho\u2019s work also engages existentialism; his edited volume,\nExistential Medicine: Essays on Health and Illness, presents\nphilosophical work on these topics influenced by Martin Heidegger,\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(2018). While these interventions point toward the health professions,\nthey engage the materiality of the body and the ontology of medicine,\nwhich in turn intertwine deeply with the theoretical efforts of\ncritical disability studies. Meanwhile, in Kierkegaard after the\nGenome, Ada Jaarsma uses S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\u2019s\nexistentialism in a wide-ranging work seeking to materialize and\npoliticize belief in bio-political, scientific spaces, including\nplacebos and epigenetics. Her work draws together critical race and\ncrip theory with Kierkegaard\u2019s concepts of freedom and despair\n(2017).\n\nFrench philosophers and collaborators Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix\nGuattari have significantly influenced work in critical disability\ntheory, especially with regard to materialism and subjectivity. Rosi\nBraidotti (1994, 2002, 2006), Kelly Fritsch (2010), Dan Goodley\n(Goodley & Lawthom 2011; Goodley, Liddiard, & Runswick Cole\n2018), Daniela Mercieca and Duncan Mercieca (2010), Griet Roets (Roets\n& Braidotti 2012), and others have used\n\u201cDeleuzoGuattarian\u201d concepts, including assemblages,\nintensities, and a distinctive approach to materiality in order to\ntheorize disability. In this view, an \u201cassemblage\u201d\ndescribes an ontological network in which component parts remain fluid\nin the roles they play in a larger whole; assemblages include\n\u201ccontingent formations\u201d and \u201cdesiring forces\u201d\n(Fritsch 2010: 3 cf. Deleuze & Guattari 1980 [1987]). This means\nthat a challenge is issued to the \u201cnormative sovereign able\nbody\u201d that is supposedly independent (Fritsch 2010: 3). This\nchallenge can be a rallying cry in disability theory. According to\nFritsch, \n\n\ndisabled people are entangled in multiple assemblages: the\nhuman-machine assemblages of wheelchairs, ventilators, or walkers;\nhuman-animal assemblages such as assistive animals like guide dogs; or\ndisabled-abled assemblages of the disabled person and care attendant.\n(2010: 3) \n\n\nFritsch cautions that this does not mean disabled people are unique;\nrather, assemblages fruitfully re-describe ontology, including those\nconsidered abled and non-abled (2010: 3). These re-descriptions can\nhelp build an \u201cintercorporeal and relational ethics that has\nrepercussions for all beings\u201d (2010: 3). \n\nRecall that critical disability theory challenges the distinction\nbetween impairment and disability, a distinction common in more\ntraditional disability studies (e.g., Shakespeare 2006). As we have\nseen, Foucauldian approaches are used to critique this distinction.\nRoets and Braidotti, meanwhile, use Deleuze and Guattari to push back\nagainst this distinction, especially the ways in which it forces a\nconception of impairment as negative, tragic, and individual. They\nattempt to balance a Deleuzian-inspired materialism with regard to the\nbody with the political goals of disability studies (2012). On a\nDeleuzoGuattarian perspective, \u201cmateriality\u201d can be viewed\nas \u201cplural, open, complex, uneven, and contingent\u201d a view\nthat opens up opportunities for this balance to be achieved (Goodley,\nLiddiard, & Runswick Cole 2018: 203).\n\nNew approaches in psychoanalysis, including strategies employing the\npsychoanalysis of Julia Kristeva, offer further critical resources to\ntheorizing disability. For instance, Josh Dohmen uses a version of\nKristeva\u2019s theory of abjection, transformed by engagement with\nSara Ahmed and Tina Chanter, to understand disability exclusion.\nDespite controversy over elements of Kristeva\u2019s work for\nthinking disability, Dohmen argues that this Kristevean account is\npreferable to the Lacanian analyses found elsewhere in disability\nstudies (2016). Meanwhile, Kristeva herself directly engages her\nconcepts in scholarship around disability, laying out a politics of\nvulnerability (e.g., Kristeva & Herman 2010). Minae Inahara uses\nLuce Irigaray as a springboard to push back against the entrenched\nableism and masculinism of Freud and Lacan and build a psychoanalytic\nunderstanding of physical disability (2009).\n\nHowever, psychoanalytic approaches favored in philosophy circles are\nin some tension with challenges to psychology found elsewhere in\ncritical disability theory. One important component of critical\ndisability theory is increased attentiveness to mental illness and\ncritique of received frames for understanding and analyzing mental\nillness. For example, to overcome the dualism endemic in more\ntraditional disability studies, Margaret Price has coined the\nformulation \u201cbodyminds\u201d to capture the full embodiment\nthat interests her in her work and to deal with the question of pain\n(2015). Price\u2019s Mad at School: Rhetorics of Mental\nDisability and Academic Life (2011), challenges the focus of\ntraditional disability studies on disabled bodies at the expense of\ndisabled minds. Price argues that academic culture is produced by and\nassumes an abled mind and tracks the impact of mental disabilities in\nhigher education (2011).\n\nFor theorists working in mad studies (e.g., Mollow 2013 and 2014) and\ncritical psychology studies (e.g., Weiner 2005a, 2005b, and Wiener,\nRibeiro, & Warner 2009), it is important to redevelop\npsychoanalytic approaches in their entirety to make them fit for these\nkinds of analyses and to break open new modes of thinking. Some\nthinkers find affect theory a fruitful location for challenging\npathologization. For instance, Goodley, Liddiard, and Runswick Cole\nfind it so, writing, \n\n\nThe affective register is always a cultural and embodied register and\nit is here that we might find moments of resistance as young people\nconnect with others to contest normative ideas that assume their\nincompetence and emotional immaturity.
