    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The Rejection of Universals\n4.2 The Rejection of Universals\n\nIn the case of universal entities, Ockham\u2019s nominalism is\nnot based on his Razor, his principle of parsimony. That is,\nOckham does not hold merely that there is no good reason for affirming\nuniversals, so that we should refrain from doing so in the absence of\nfurther evidence. No, he holds that theories of universals, or at\nleast the theories he considers, are outright incoherent; they either\nare self-contradictory or at least violate certain other things we\nknow are true in virtue of the three sources just cited. For Ockham,\nthe only universal entities it makes sense to talk about are universal\nconcepts, and derivative on them, universal terms in spoken and\nwritten language. Metaphysically, these \u201cuniversal\u201d\nconcepts are singular entities like all others; they are\n\u201cuniversal\u201d only in the sense of being \u201cpredicable\nof many.\u201d\n\nWith respect to the exact ontological status of such conceptual\nentities, however, Ockham changed his view over the course of his\ncareer. To begin with, he adopted what is known as the\nfictum-theory, a theory according to which universals have no\n\u201creal\u201d existence at all in the Aristotelian categories,\nbut instead are purely \u201cintentional objects\u201d with a\nspecial mode of existence; they have only a kind of\n\u201cthought\u201d-reality. Eventually, however, Ockham came to\nthink this intentional realm of \u201cfictive\u201d entities was not\nneeded, and by the time of his Summa of Logic and the\nQuodlibets adopts instead a so called\nintellectio-theory, according to which a universal concept is\njust the act of thinking about several objects at once; metaphysically\nsuch an \u201cact\u201d is a singular quality of an individual mind,\nand is \u201cuniversal\u201d only in the sense of being a mental\nsign of several things at once and being predicable of them in mental\n propositions.[32]\n",
