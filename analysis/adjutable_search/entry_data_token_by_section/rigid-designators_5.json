These theories address either the question of what\nit is that designating terms say or express or contribute to the\ncontent of propositions that they are used to articulate, or the\nquestion how it is that designating terms come to say or express or\ncontribute the content they do. The relationship between rigidity and\nthese other theories of reference, which is often blurred in the\nliterature, can be brought into focus in a way that is fairly\nuncontroversial, in many instances.\n2.2.1 Direct Reference\n\nAbout the time Kripke named rigidity, Kaplan named the theory of\n\u201cdirect reference\u201d (in \u201cDemonstratives,\u201d\neventually published as 1989a: see 1989b, p. 571). As the theory is\nusually understood, it is the position that the semantic content of a\nname or other directly referring expression is nothing more than the\nreferent: the referent is all that the name contributes to a\nproposition expressed by a sentence containing it. So there is no\ndescriptive information semantically conveyed by a directly referring\nexpression. If we think of propositions as \u201cstructured entities\nlooking something like the sentences which express them,\u201d as\nKaplan invites us to do, we can think of directly referring terms as\nterms whose contribution to a proposition lacks the structure that\ncharacterizes the contribution of definite descriptions. In the case\nof a definite description, \u201cthe constituent of the proposition\nwill be some sort of complex, constructed from various attributes by\nlogical composition. But in the case of a singular term which is\ndirectly referential, the constituent of the proposition is just the\nobject itself\u201d (Kaplan 1989a, p. 494; see also the section\nrelating possible worlds and structured propositions in the entry on\n structured propositions).\n\nDirect reference theorists (e.g., Soames 2002, pp. 240, 243), also\ncalled \u201cMillians\u201d after J. S. Mill, insist that\n\u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 and \u2018Hesperus =\nHesperus\u2019 express the same proposition or share the same\ncontent. At first glance, these statements appear to say different\nthings, but if \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019\ncontribute no descriptive information (like is a morning star\nor is an evening star) to the proposition expressed by either\nsentence, but only the referent, which is the same for each term, then\nthe sentences have to say the same thing despite first appearances.\n\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that rigidity cannot be\nidentified with direct reference. That is because some\nexpressions designate rigidly by means of describing the\ndesignatum: e.g., \u2018The successor of 2\u2019, which rigidly\ndesignates 3. Kripke calls designators like \u2018The successor of\n2\u2019 rigid de facto, rather than rigid de jure:\nthe description happens to be satisfied by the same object in every\npossible world and never anything else. Compare the intuitively\ndistinct case of de jure rigidity in a name, like\n\u2018Biden\u2019. Here the intent is to refer to this\nperson in all possible worlds, whatever descriptions may\ndesignate him.  Still, not all rigid de jure expressions seem to be directly referential (as some direct reference theorists agree: e.g., Kaplan 1989b, p.\n577n.25; cf. Salmon 2003, pp. 486\u20137; see also Stanley\u2019s 1997a\ndiscussion: 570\u20131).  An example of a description that is rigid de jure might be \u2018The famous\nhumanist most closely associated, in \u03b1, with the Italian\nRenaissance\u2019, where \u2018\u03b1\u2019 is a name for the actual world (on world-indexing, see Plantinga 1974, pp. 62\u201365), or a similar actualized description.[6]  The\ndesignatum must first be picked out in \u03b1 by whether it meets the\ndescriptive requirements (with or without the indexing) there in\n\u03b1: but the purpose of the indexing is to keep the term\nreferring, with respect to other worlds, to that same item\npicked out originally in \u03b1 by virtue of meeting the right\nrequirements there.  So the rigidity seems de jure.\n  \nDescriptivists claim that names are disguised descriptions:  perhaps a rigidified description like the foregoing captures that content of \u2018Petrarch\u2019.  Direct reference theorists deny that names have descriptive content like this.  Either way, the rigidity of names and even de jure rigidity of names could plausibly be honored (as opponents of direct reference hold, such as Plantinga 1985, pp. 82\u20137; Sidelle 1992; 1995; Justice 2003; the same goes for hybid views as well as the polar views discussed:  Garcia-Carpintero 2018).\n2.2.2 Causal Grounding\n\nAnother theory of reference that was named about the time \u2018rigid\ndesignator\u2019 was coined, and that is widely associated with rigid\ndesignation, is the causal theory of reference. All that is relevant\nhere is one method of term dubbing associated with that theory.\nAccording to a typical causal theorist, many terms are coined in a\n\u201cbaptismal ceremony,\u201d during which the dubber points at an\nobject in her perceptual field (hence, the object\u2019s causal role), and\nestablishes reference by appeal to this object. The baptismal object\nmight become the referent, if the term\u2019s coiner says something to this\neffect: \u201cTerm t is to be used for that\nobject.\u201d The baptismal object might also be a sample of a\nsubstance that becomes the referent, if the term\u2019s coiner says\nsomething to this effect: \u201cTerm t is to be used for the\nsubstance instantiated by that object.\u201d Or the\nobject might have some other connection to the referent, as might\nhappen if the term\u2019s coiner says something to this effect: \u201cTerm\nt is to be used for the ceremonial function of that\nancient artifact,\u201d or \u201cTerm t is to be used for\nthe leader of that wolf pack.\u201d Most of these examples\ninvolve a definite description, which is used to \u201cfix the\nreference\u201d (Kripke 1980, pp. 54\u20136, 135), and not as a\nsynonym: the term is to apply to the designatum even with respect\nworlds in which it does not satisfy the description. In all of these\nexamples, whether the relevant term designates in a given instance\ndepends on the properties of the object used to ground reference in\nthe baptismal ceremony. The relevant properties may not be known to\nthe term\u2019s coiner.\n\nSome philosophers seem to think that rigid terms are just those coined\nin accordance with a baptism like the\n above.[7]\n But causal grounding is not closely tied to rigidity. Since many\nphilosophers deny that rigidity applies to designators for kinds (see\nbelow), designators for other entities serve better to illustrate.\nFirst, designators that are rigid can fail to be causally grounded.\n\u2018The successor of 2\u2019, which is rigid de facto, may be a\ncase in point. \u20183\u2019 might be an example of a rigid de\njure term that is not causally grounded. And there can evidently\nbe terms for concrete objects that are rigid but not causally\ngrounded. You coin \u2018Joy\u2019 in the following way:\n\u201c\u2018Joy\u2019 is to be used for the most joy-filled\nindividual.\u201d Here you use the description to fix the reference,\nnot as a synonym: whatever individual is most filled with joy is the\ndesignatum, even when we are discussing worlds in which that same\nindividual is glum. Reference is not secured by way of causal\ngrounding; you never point to anything in a baptismal\n ceremony.[8]\n Yet the designator is rigid.\n\nSo designators that are rigid might fail to be causally grounded.\nDesignators that are causally grounded might also fail to be rigid.\nYou find an old painting. After engaging in some convoluted discussion\nabout legal ownership, you decide to clarify your terms: \u201cLet\nthe expression \u2018Originalowner\u2019 designate, for any possible\nworld w, the original owner in w of that\npainting\u201d (you point at the painting). You have causally\ngrounded \u2018Originalowner\u2019 by means of a baptismal ceremony;\nbut the referent varies from world to world, depending on who first\nowned the painting. The term is not rigid.\n2.2.3 Descriptivism\n\nThe rigidity of names does not rule out descriptivism.  As we\u2019ve seen, disguised descriptions may be world-indexed or otherwise rigidified. The present section discusses strategies for maintaining descriptivism according\nto which a name like \u2018Petrarch\u2019 has the same content as ordinary nonrigid descriptions like \u2018The famous\nhumanist most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance\u2019.\n2.2.3.1 Names as Wide-Scope Descriptions\n\nOne proposal to defend traditional, non-world-indexed descriptivism\nhas taken the label \u201cwidescopism.\u201d According to this\nproposal, the rigidity of names is or may be treated as a matter of\nscope. \u2018Petrarch\u2019, on this view, may be a disguised\nordinary description meaning the same as \u2018The famous humanist\nmost closely associated with the Italian Renaissance\u2019. It is\nnatural to think that \u2018Petrarch\u2019 cannot have this semantic\ncontent, since \u2018Petrarch might not have been famous\u2019 seems\nunambiguously true, but \u2018The famous humanist most closely\nassociated with the Italian Renaissance might not have been\nfamous\u2019 has a false reading. It can have the same truth\nconditions as a scoped sentence something like, \u2018It might have\nbeen the case that: for some x, x is the famous\nhumanist most closely associated with the Italian Renaissance and\nx has never been famous\u2019, which is false. But according\nto the proposal in question, the false reading for \u2018The famous\nhumanist most closely associated with the Italian Renaissance might\nnot have been famous\u2019 does not show that \u2018Petrarch\u2019\nfails to mean the same as \u2018the famous humanist most closely\nassociated with the Italian Renaissance\u2019. The other reading is\nthe relevant one. According to that reading, the name takes wide\nscope, and the truth conditions are the same as those for a sentence\nlike, \u2018For some x, x is the famous humanist\nmost closely associated with the Italian Renaissance and it might have\nbeen the case that: x has never been famous\u2019, which is\ntrue.\n\nKripke (1980 pp. 11\u201315) points out that there are problems with\nthis attempt to accommodate rigidity. Some sentences have no modal\noperators. When we evaluate these sentences with respect to other\nworlds, we do not seem to admit that the designatum changes, as it\nwould if names were non-rigid descriptions taking the proper scope in\nmodal contexts. Thus, we can describe a possible world in which\nPetrarch dies as an infant. With respect to such a world, would\n\u2018Petrarch is never famous\u2019 be true? It seems so. But on\nthe proposal in question, the sentence would say the same as\n\u2018The famous humanist most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance is never famous\u2019, which is false with respect to any\nworld. Also, it seems that we can make names appear inside\nthe scope of a modal operator: \u201cIt might have been the case\nthat: Petrarch never became famous.\u201d This would apparently be\nimpossible to do on the view in question, but we seem to be able to do\nit. On the basis of such considerations, Kripke rejects this proposal\nfor accommodating rigidity within descriptivism.\n\nKripke\u2019s arguments seem to have persuaded most of his audience\n(including Salmon 1981, p. 26n.28), and his principal target, Michael\nDummett, has responded by making some modifications (1981, pp.\nxvii\u2013xix). Others have followed Dummett with more sophisticated variations (e.g., Sosa 2001; Hunter 2005; cf. Caplan 2005;\nEverett 2005; cf. Soames 2005; a good overview is provided by Noonan 2013, chap\n13).\n2.2.3.2 Assertoric Content and Ingredient Sense\n\nAssuming that Kripke\u2019s arguments against widescopism are successful,\nit might appear that rigid and nonrigid designators differ in content.\nThus, any statement S containing a proper name cannot\nhave the same content as a statement S\u2032 that differs\nfrom S just in the respect that a proper name in S\nis replaced by a non-rigid designator in S\u2032.\nFollowing Stanley (whose precise formulations differ slightly from\nthis and from each other: 1997a, pp. 568\u20139; 1997b, p. 135), we\nmight call this the Rigidity Thesis.\n\nBut Dummett has still another suggestion that, if successful, would\nrefute the Rigidity Thesis (or at least one understanding of it).\nConsider the similarity between (1)\u2013(4):\n\n(1)\nThe famous humanist most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance wrote the epic Africa\n(2)\nThe famous humanist now most closely associated with the\nItalian Renaissance wrote the epic Africa\n(3)\nThe famous humanist here most closely associated with the\nItalian Renaissance wrote the epic Africa\n(4)\nThe famous humanist in \u03b1 most closely associated\nwith the Italian Renaissance wrote the epic Africa.\n\n\nIn some intuitive sense, it might seem that these statements share the\nsame content. Thus, for example, what one believes when one assents to\nany of (2)\u2013(4) might seem to be what one believes when one\nassents to (1). Even so, (1)\u2013(4) contribute different semantic\nvalues to complex sentences in which they are embedded. What one\nbelieves when assenting to (1\u2032) is not what one believes in\nassenting, say, to (2\u2032):\n\n(1\u2032)\nIt will always be the case that the famous\nhumanist most closely associated with the Italian Renaissance wrote\nthe epic Africa\n(2\u2032)\nIt will always be the case that the famous\nhumanist now most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance wrote the epic Africa.\n\n\n(1\u2032) is dubiously true, at best. It might well be that Lorenzo\nValla will overtake Petrarch at some future time, being a famous\nhumanist more closely associated with the Italian Renaissance than\nPetrarch. And Valla did not write the epic Africa. On the\nother hand, (2\u2032) is true, at least assuming, for the sake of an\nillustration, that (1) and (2) are true. On that assumption, it does\nnot matter that Valla might overtake Petrarch later: that will be too\nlate to affect their respective status as it is now.\n\nGiven that (1)\u2013(4) make different semantic contributions to\ncomplex sentences in which they are embedded, must we reject the\nearlier suggestion that they share the same content? Here we might use\na tip from Dummett to resist an affirmative answer. We might\nacknowledge that (1)\u2013(4) share the same truth conditions, which\namount to at least one bona fide use of \u2018content\u2019. Thus,\nfor Dummett, a speaker who could classify sufficiently detailed\npossible states of\n affairs[9]\n into those that render any statement like these \u201ccorrect and\nthose that render it incorrect, may be said to know the assertoric\ncontent of the sentence\u201d (1991, p. 48). And we might also\nacknowledge a distinct phenomenon that is responsible for different\ncontributions (1)\u2013(4) make to larger sentences in which they are\nembedded: Dummett calls this distinct phenomenon a sentence\u2019s\n\u201cingredient sense.\u201d \u201cIngredient sense is what\nsemantic theories are concerned to explain\u201d (p. 48).\n\nArmed with the distinction between assertoric content and ingredient\nsense, we might reject the Rigidity Thesis. We might maintain that\n(1)\u2013(4) have the same assertoric content and hence that they say\nthe same thing: anyone who asserts one of these (or believes it,\nrejects it, and so on), also asserts the others. Where they differ is\nin ingredient sense.\n\nThere are a number of lines of thinking that converge on the\nconclusion that (1)\u2013(4) share the same assertoric content even\nthough they differ in ingredient sense. As already suggested, some\nmight find it natural to take (1)\u2013(4) as expressing the same\n\u201csemantic content\u201d in some meaningful sense (perhaps the\nonly meaningful sense): if so, Dummett\u2019s distinction indicates how one\nmight coherently maintain that position. Such a position might be\nespecially natural in view of \u201cdescriptive names,\u201d like\nEvans\u2019 famous \u2018Julius\u2019, which is a rigid designator\nfor whoever invented the zipper (Evans 1979). It might seem natural to\nsay that \u2018Julius is an inventor\u2019 has the same content as\n\u2018Whoever invented the zipper is an inventor\u2019, even though\nthe former is contingent and the latter necessary. Evans himself\nsuggests that such pairs of sentences \u201chave the same content,\ndespite their modal differences\u201d (Evans 1979, p. 187n.10). \n\nThere are other related considerations in favor of saying that\n(1)\u2013(4) share the same assertoric content even though they\ndiffer in ingredient sense: here is a sketch of a couple of\nconsiderations from Stanley, who develops Dummett\u2019s suggestion in\nadmirable detail in a series of interesting papers (1997a, 1997b,\n2002). First, one might maintain that what one asserts, when one\nasserts (1), is simply true or false, and not true now but false\nlater, true here but false in some other community where Valla is more\nhighly esteemed than Petrarch, true in \u03b1 but false in other\npossible worlds. Yet what (1) contributes to the likes of\n(2)\u2013(4) is not simply true or false: it is rather something like\na function from times, places, or worlds, respectively, to truth\nvalues. That function generates a different truth value depending on\nthe argument (Stanley 1997a, p. 577; see also King 2003 \u00a71; for\nrelated claims, see Lewis 1998). Hence, the line of thinking\nconcludes, what is asserted, when one asserts (1), is assertoric\ncontent and not ingredient sense.\n\nAnother line of thinking by which one might argue that (1)\u2013(4)\nshare the same assertoric content even though they differ in\ningredient sense starts from general considerations about what kind of\nanimal \u201ccontent\u201d is. For Stanley, the content of a\nstatement is closely tied to what it is used to communicate in normal\ncontexts, where \u201cnormal\u201d has to do with the competence of\nspeakers, their intentions to use words as others do, and so on\n(1997b, 136; 2002). In such contexts, he says, (1)\u2013(4) are used\nto communicate the same thing. So they have the same content, the same\nmeaning. Meaning, which facilitates communication in the right\ncontexts, is constituted by presuppositions on the part of speakers.\nIn contexts of modal evaluation, two sentences asserting the same\nthing can diverge in their contribution to larger sentences or diverge\nin truth value with respect to counterfactual worlds under\nconsideration because \u201cmeaning-constituting presuppositions are\nirrelevant for modal evaluation. It is the purpose of modal evaluation\nto suspend presuppositions,\u201d on this way of thinking about\ncontent (Stanley 2002, p. 338; see also 1997b, p. 155).\n\nIf the distinction between assertoric and ingredient sense is tenable,\nand if (1)\u2013(4) share the same assertoric content even though\nthey differ in ingredient sense, so that the Rigidity Thesis is false,\nthen this opens the door to holding that proper names share the same\ncontent as ordinary, non-indexed descriptions after all, even though\nnames are rigid and ordinary, non-indexed descriptions are not rigid.\nIn that case, something along the lines of the venerable descriptivism\nassociated with Frege and Russell (see the subsection on description\ntheories in the entry on\n reference\n and the section on descriptive theories of proper names in the entry\non\n descriptions),\n which Kripke is widely thought to have devastated, survives. One way\nto develop a descriptivism along these lines would be to say that a\nname like \u2018Petrarch\u2019 is something like a disguised\ndescription that is shorthand for \u2018the famous humanist most\nclosely associated in \u03b1 with the Italian\nRenaissance\u2019. Although this description for which\n\u2018Petrarch\u2019 is shorthand is world-indexed, it shares the\ndescriptive content of the non-indexed \u2018the famous humanist most\nclosely associated with the Italian Renaissance\u2019. On this\nsuggestion, since \u2018Petrarch\u2019 shares the content of the\nrigid description, it also shares the content of the nonrigid\ndescription.\n\nKripke\u2019s reservations about descriptivism go deeper than arguments\nfrom rigidity or indeed arguments from any considerations pertaining\nto the metaphysics of modality: there are quite distinct worries about\nwhether speakers would have to be in possession of the relevant\ndescriptive information to use \u2018Petrarch\u2019, for example.\nCould not someone refer to Petrarch by \u2018Petrarch\u2019 if she\nsupposed that Valla were the famous humanist most closely associated\nwith the Italian Renaissance and she associated with\n\u2018Petrarch\u2019 only the description \u2018a clergyman who\ncriticized the Avignon papacy\u2019? If so, a standard argument runs,\nthe content of \u2018Petrarch\u2019 cannot be the same as that of\n\u2018the famous humanist most closely associated with the Italian\nRenaissance\u2019. There may be a few descriptive names of\nthe relevant variety in natural language: Dummett adduces \u2018St.\nJoachim\u2019, which he takes to have been \u201cintroduced as\ndenoting the father of the Blessed Virgin, whoever that may have\nbeen\u201d (1991, p. 48), and Kripke adduces \u2018Jack the\nRipper\u2019, introduced for the murderer of so and so (1980,\n79\u201380; for doubts, see Devitt 2020, 414\u2013415). But it is unlikely that there are many such descriptive\nproper names in natural language. Still, it may be that more\nsophisticated descriptivisms appealing to more sophisticated\ndescriptions could overcome worries like these further,\nnon-metaphysical worries about typical names (see, e.g., Nelson\n2002).\n2.2.3.3 Descriptivism, Anti-Descriptivism, and the Importance of Rigidity\n\nNone of the foregoing considerations \n in favor of the fruitfulness of distinguishing assertoric content and\ningredient sense is beyond controversy. One might resist (critics\ninclude Everett 2005, pp. 125\u201338; King 2007, pp. 168\u2013196;\nShieh 2001, pp. 379\u201380; Soames 2005, pp. 321\u20133n.; defenders include Ninian 2012; Stalnaker\n2014, pp. 23\u201324; Yalcin 2014). But the question of whether the\nforegoing descriptivist line of thinking is sound, or whether any\ndescriptivist line is sound, is less important here than the question\nof what rides on the answer for rigidity.\n\nIf the Dummettian line of thinking about assertoric and ingredient sense\n is sound, does rigidity lose its interest? It would appear that the\nanswer is\n No.[10]\n The fundamental work for rigidity sketched already \n seems largely independent of these issues.\n\nThe fundamental work in question concerns the metaphysics of modality,\nfor the most part. But assertoric content does not have much to do\nwith the metaphysics of modality, so the claim that apparently rigid\ndesignators as well as nonrigid designators have a descriptive\nassertoric content seems not to threaten the extent or significance of\nrigidity: \u201cthe propositional content of a sentence in a context\nis not its modal content\u201d (Stanley 2002,\n 338).[11]\n\nSome of the fundamental work concerns\nepistemology: e.g., the issue of whether a sentence like\n\u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 is a posteriori as well as\nnecessarily true. Would the above considerations in favor of distinguishing assertoric from ingredient sense\n undermine Kripke\u2019s ideas here, at least, even if the\nconsiderations do not undermine Kripke\u2019s ideas about modality? That\nseems unlikely. On the contrary, the claim that names, though rigid,\nshare the semantic content of descriptions seems likely to\nvindicate Kripke\u2019s claims about the epistemic status of\nstatements like the above, if anything. That is because one could say\nthat \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 differ in\nassertoric content (in an extended sense, applied to designators\nrather than statements) but they do not differ in ingredient sense or\nmodal content. Because they do not differ in ingredient sense or modal\ncontent, being rigid designators for the same thing, \u2018Hesperus =\nPhosphorus\u2019 is necessarily true. Because they do differ\nin assertoric content, \u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 is a\nposteriori; \u2018Hesperus = Hesperus\u2019, by contrast, is a\npriori since both occurrences of \u2018Hesperus\u2019 have one and\nthe same assertoric content. So descriptivism of this sophisticated\nsort suggests one means to retain Kripke\u2019s epistemic claims.\nAnti-descriptivism in the form of direct reference, by contrast, is\nincompatible with at least one interpretation of the claim that\n\u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 is \u201ca posteriori\u201d,\n because on the theory of direct reference, \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 just share the same content, end of story: so\n\u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 shares the same content as\n\u2018Hesperus = Hesperus\u2019, which is a priori just in virtue of\ncontent (again, on one interpretation of the claim that the statement\nis \u201ca priori\u201d).\n\nRigidity\u2019s work is compatible with descriptivism. Although some\nphilosophers seem to have the impression that the important work that\nrigidity performs is to refute descriptivism, this seems to\nbe a mistake. A related impression is that the important work that\nKripke performs is to refute descriptivism: the rigidity of\nterms and more just falls out of anti-descriptivism, so\nanti-descriptivism is what really matters at bottom (see below,\n \u00a74.2).\n But there are strong reasons to resist this assessment of rigidity\u2019s\nimportance or lack thereof, too.\n\nFirst, it might be replied that even if names are non-descriptive,\ndirectly referring terms, it might not follow that they are rigid: a\ndirectly referential designator can be nonrigid, at least in principle\n(see \n note 5).\n If this thought is right, then the work that rigidity performs for\nnames does not follow from anti-descriptivism. More is required.\n\nFurther, even if rigidity does follow from anti-descriptivism,\nanti-descriptivism does not follow from rigidity: so rigidity\u2019s work\nis not limited to that of direct reference. We have seen that\ndescriptive designators may be rigid: e.g., world-indexed designators.\nBut rigidity performs much of the same work on these as on arguably\nnondescriptive expressions like names. For example, \u2018The evening\nstar in \u03b1 = the morning star in \u03b1\u2019 would seem to be\na necessarily true, a posteriori statement whose necessity and\naposteriority cannot be explained in terms of the nondescriptive\nnature of the designators flanking the \u2018=\u2019 sign.\n\nSuppose we limit our consideration to names. By ignoring\nnon-names, we can ignore descriptive designators that are\nrigid, provided that names are nondescriptive, directly referring\ndesignators: suppose again that they are. Still, it might be wise to\ndistinguish sharply the significance of rigidity from that of the\ntheory of direct reference. That is because rigidity\u2019s importance does\nnot hang on the outcome of controversies surrounding the theory of\ndirect reference (a controversial theory, as proponents concede:\nSalmon 2003, p. 475; Soames 2005, p. 3). Where direct reference is\ncalled into question, it should not be thought that rigidity is\nthereby called into question. The fate of rigidity\u2019s significance is\ndistinct from the fate of direct reference\u2019s\n significance.[12]\n\nFinally, even if direct reference is to be taken for granted and\nrigidity for names does follow from direct reference, one might not\ndraw the conclusion that rigidity loses interest. Here is an analogy.\nFew would say that if the theory of special relativity, with all of\nits claims about the relativity of space and time, follows from the\ntheory of general relativity, then special relativity loses interest\nbecause in that case, general relativity is what really matters:\nspecial relativity and much more just follow from it. There is\nevidently something wrong with this attempt to devalue the theory of\nspecial relativity. It would be better to say that part of what is\ninteresting about general relativity concerns its implications for the\nrelativity of space and time, as explained by the theory of special\nrelativity: special relativity retains its interest as part of a\nlarger, more fundamental theory. In the same way, rigidity might be\nsaid to lose no interest even if it is explained by something more\nfundamental.\n\nIt might be tempting, then, to think that if descriptivism survives,\nthen rigidity is useless because its work, which is to refute\ndescriptivism, is left unperformed. It might also be tempting to think\nthat if descriptivism is defeated but by considerations that are more\nfundamental than rigidity and that give rise to rigidity, then\nrigidity is superfluous because its work is performed but by other\nphenomena. The foregoing paragraphs offer reasons for thinking that\nthese tempting lines of thought are erroneous. If these reasons are\nsound, then unless there are other, quite unheralded ties between\nrigidity and descriptivism or its opposition, rigidity\u2019s interest\nwould seem to be largely independent of the fate of these rival\ntheories about semantic content.\n3. Philosophical Work for Rigidity.\n\nAs already indicated, rigidity does interesting epistemological and\nmetaphysical work. Sections (3.1)\u2013(3.5) below discuss various\nareas of work.\n3.1 The Necessary A Posteriori\n\nBecause of the rigid designation of the names it contains,\n\u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 is necessarily true. Since\nempirical work on the part of astronomers was required to determine\nthat the statement is true, we seem to have an illustration of\nnecessary, a posteriori truth. Thus, rigid designation seems to play a\ncrucial role in securing necessity with surprising epistemological\nsignificance. Prior to discussion about rigid designation, the\nnecessary a posteriori was generally thought to be an empty category.\nRigid designation, along with other referential mechanisms discussed\nin connection with it, has\nchanged all that, going \u201cagainst the assumption of centuries of philosophers,\u201d as Linda Zagzebski relates (Zagzebski 2017, p. 213).  Thus, Putnam observes that rigidity has\n\u201cstartling consequences for the theory of necessary truth\u201d\n(1975, p. 232).\n\nSince Kant there has been a big split between philosophers who thought\nthat all necessary truths were analytic and philosophers who thought\nthat some necessary truths were synthetic a priori. But none of these\nphilosophers thought that a (metaphysically) necessary truth could\nfail to be a priori (Putnam 1975, p. 233).\n\n\nThere is no question that a major reason for excitement about rigidity\nis that it underwrites the necessary a posteriori (see also Schwartz 2002, pp.\n270ff.). However, in light of the theory of direct reference, this\napparent coup may have been overstated or misunderstood. As we\nobserved, direct reference theorists insist that \u2018Hesperus =\nPhosphorus\u2019 and \u2018Hesperus = Hesperus\u2019 express the\nsame proposition or share the same content even though these\nstatements have the appearance of saying different things. For direct\nreference theorists, to say that Hesperus = Phosphorus is to say no\nmore and no less than to say that Hesperus = Hesperus. Since it is a\npriori that Hesperus = Hesperus, it is a priori that Hesperus =\nPhosphorus. For this reason, the claim that rigidity presents\npropositions that are necessarily true and a posteriori might be\ndisputed (Soames 2002, pp. 240, 243; Salmon 1986, pp. 133\u201342;\nFitch 1976; for further discussion, see Fitch 2004, pp. 110\u201313;\nHughes 2004, pp.\n 84\u2013108).[13]\n\nSo it is controversial, though common, to say that rigidity assures\nthat the proposition Hesperus = Phosphorus is necessarily\ntrue and a posteriori. On the other hand, it may be less problematic\nor less controversial to say that rigidity assures that the\nsentence or statement (interpreted sentence)\n\u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 is necessarily true even though we\ncan find this out only a posteriori (Fitch 2004, pp. 110\u201313;\nHughes 2004, pp. 106\u20137; cf. Kripke 1980, pp. 20\u20131). If it\nis tenable to say that rigidity assures that some sentences\nor statements like this are necessarily true though a\nposteriori, further questions immediately impose themselves. Here is a\nsalient question: Does the aposteriority that characterizes the\nnecessarily true statements retain its epistemological significance\nand surprise, given that it is associated with statements rather than\npropositions? The question carries some importance in view of the\npopularity of Millianism; yet despite all of the debate about the\ncorrectness of Millianism, the question has been neglected.\n\nHere is one challenge to the proposal that the relevant statements are\nnecessarily true and a posteriori in any interesting respect. The\nproposal apparently amounts to this: the sentence \u2018Hesperus =\nPhosphorus\u2019 is necessarily true as it is used by English\nspeakers and it is an a posteriori matter to determine that it is. But\nif this is all that the a posteriori necessity of \u2018Hesperus =\nPhosphorus\u2019 amounts to, then all necessary statements are a\nposteriori in the relevant way. So, the necessary a posteriori loses\nits interest. To find out how English speakers use any sentence at\nall, one needs an empirical look at the world. Even \u2018The circle\ncannot be squared\u2019, which is generally regarded as a priori,\nseems to come out a posteriori on the account. It is an a posteriori\nmatter to determine that \u2018The circle cannot be squared\u2019 is\nnecessarily true as used by English speakers. The reader is\ninvited to think over whether the intended position lacks interest in\nthis or other ways (there is room in the literature for\ncontributions:  for discussion, see LaPorte 2020, p. 326). \n3.2 The Contingent A Priori\n\nAccording to Kripke, a proper understanding of rigidity also reveals\nthat some contingent statements are a priori. Kripke considers the\nstandard meter stick, which has been used to define the length of one\nmeter. Someone decreed that the expression \u2018one meter\u2019 is\nto be used for the unit of length of that stick, perhaps at a certain\ntime in the stick\u2019s existence. The stick, S, might not have\nbeen the length that it was at the time \u2018one meter\u2019 was\ncoined: had it been heated or cooled it might have been longer or\nshorter. As things are, it was not heated or cooled. So the sentence\n\u2018One meter = the length of S (at time\nt0)\u2019 is true in the actual world but it is\nfalse in some possible worlds: it is contingently true. Yet S\nhas been used to define \u2018one meter\u2019, in the sense\nthat it fixes the reference (see above), so the definers of \u2018one\nmeter\u2019 know a priori the truth of the sentence \u2018The length\none meter is instantiated by S (at time\nt0)\u2019. The reason that the sentence is\ncontingently true is that \u2018one meter\u2019 is a rigid\ndesignator for the length one meter. \u2018The length of S\n(at time t0)\u2019 is, on the other hand, a\nnon-rigid designator for one meter; in this world it designates one\nmeter but in other worlds, those in which S is heated or\ncooled, \u2018the length of S (at time\nt0)\u2019 designates other lengths.\n\nThe contingent a priori has not been as widely discussed as the\nnecessary a posteriori. The introduction of the contingent a priori is\nperhaps less surprising than the introduction of the necessary a\nposteriori, in view of the plausible contingency of a priori\nstatements that philosophers all along recognized, like the plausible\ncontingency of the statement, as uttered in a context, \u2018I\nexist\u2019. Further, Kripke\u2019s examples of the contingent a priori\nare perhaps more controversial than his examples of the necessary a\nposteriori. Many dispute that the examples really are examples of the\ncontingent a priori (Donnellan 1977; Hughes 2004, pp. 84\u2013107;\nPlantinga 1974, pp. 8\u20139n.; Salmon 1987\u20131988; cf. Kripke 2019, Other Internet Resources for a defense; Oppy 1994; Salmon 2020 distinguishes an interesting notion related to the contingent a priori that Kripke has allegedly identified). And even if they are contingent and a priori, many feel they\nlack much significance. They are not \u201cscary,\u201d as Donnellan\nputs it (also Fitch 2004, p. 121).  On the other hand, confusions are\nlike loose threads: they sometimes work their way to apparently remote\nmaterial. Confusion about the contingent a priori can and arguably\ndoes lead to confusion and apparent paradox in unsuspected areas of\nphilosophy (an alleged example is discussed in LaPorte 2003). Kripke\n(1980, pp. 14\u201315) recalls that considerations about the\ncontingent a priori led in his mind to a number of clarifications\nconcerning designation, which again is hardly surprising given the\ninterconnectedness of different issues in a fabric.\n3.3 Theoretical Identities\n\nThe statements of necessity associated with rigid designation are\ninteresting from an epistemological standpoint, as just indicated.\nThey are also interesting from a metaphysical standpoint.\n\nRigid designation seems needed on the part of both designators if\nthere are to be true \u201ctheoretical identity statements\u201d:\nstatements in which a designator designates by way of expressing\nexplicitly in some manner one of the designatum\u2019s theoretically\ninteresting essences. The argument is not often put explicitly. It is\nhelpful to outline explicitly the line of reasoning in order to bring\nout more clearly what stands or falls with rigidity.\n\nNot all identity statements widely accepted as necessary specify a\ntheoretically interesting essence in the relevant respect.\n\u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019 or \u2018Cicero = Tully\u2019 do\nnot; each sentence contains only names for an object. But take, on the\nother hand, \u2018Cicero = the organism descended from sperm\ns and egg e\u2019, where \u2018s\u2019\nand \u2018e\u2019 are names for the right sperm and egg.\nMany regard this sentence as necessarily true and revealing of a\ntheoretical essence of Cicero: roughly, a theoretically interesting\nproperty possessed by Cicero in all possible worlds and never\npossessed by anyone else (bear in mind, for this example, limited demands of weak necessity).\n In order for any identity statement to be true of necessity, both\ndesignators must be rigid if either is. And if \u2018the organism\ndescended from sperm s and egg e\u2019 indeed\nexpresses an essence of Cicero, it must designate just Cicero in all\npossible worlds, and hence rigidly: so, given that the statement at\nissue is necessarily true, \u2018Cicero\u2019 must be rigid, too.\nAlternatively, if \u2018Cicero\u2019 is rigid, as is widely\nacknowledged, then in order for the statement at issue to be\nnecessarily true, \u2018the organism descended from sperm s\nand egg e\u2019 must be rigid and so express an essence of\nCicero.\n\nThe foregoing paragraphs address a line of reasoning according to\nwhich rigid designation is needed for certain statements to come out\nnecessarily true. Usually, rigidity is discussed with a view not to\nits being necessary for the completion of a job but rather\nwith a view to its being sufficient for the completion of a\njob. The rigid designation of both designators flanking an identity\nsign in a true theoretical identity statement is sufficient to\nestablish the necessity of the statement. If we acknowledge that\n\u2018the organism descended from sperm s and egg\ne\u2019 is rigid, and we acknowledge that\n\u2018Cicero\u2019 is rigid, then we are committed to the necessity,\nin case of truth, of \u2018Cicero = the organism descended from sperm\ns and egg e\u2019. The reasoning is parallel to\nthat given for the case of \u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019\nabove.\n\n\u2018Cicero = the organism descended from sperm s and egg\ne\u2019 shows that statements about individuals can, in\neffect, be theoretical identity statements. The most commonly\ndiscussed theoretical identity statements concern kinds. They include\n\u2018Gold = the element with atomic number 79\u2019 and\n\u2018Water = H2O\u2019 (Kripke 1980, pp. 138\u201340,\n148). Similar reasoning might apply. Here the reasoning is again\nnearly always left implicit; one must fill in gaps to present a\ngeneral line of thought that seems to accord with a widely held, if\nnot widely articulated, tradition. For that tradition, in order for it\nto be the case that \u2018Water = H2O\u2019 is\nnecessarily true, both designators must be rigid if either is. So if\nthe statement is necessarily true and either \u2018water\u2019 is\nrigid by virtue of being a name for a substance or else\n\u2018H2O\u2019 is rigid by virtue of expressing an\nessence, both designators need to be rigid. And again, the\nrigidity of designators in a true theoretical identity statement is\nsufficient for the statement\u2019s necessity. If\n\u2018H2O\u2019 is a rigid designator of a substance, and\n\u2018water\u2019 is a rigid designator of a substance, and\n\u2018Water = H2O\u2019 is true, then that statement is\nnecessarily true.\n\nTheoretical identity statements are of interest across the gamut of\nphilosophy. Various writers appeal to rigid designation to support\nviews about the essences not only of kinds from chemistry or biology\nbut also kinds from philosophical subdisciplines apparently far\nremoved from empirical science: ethics and aesthetics, for example\n(see, e.g., Carney 1982; Funkhouser 2014, pp. 4, 164; Gampel 1997;\nLeddy 1987; Noonan 2020). The reader interested in pursuing any of these traditions\nshould beware that attempts to apply rigidity in the foregoing\nsubdisciplines, especially early attempts, sometimes confuse rigidity\nwith other phenomena recognized by popular theories of reference: see\nclarifications in section 2.2. \n\nBy far, the most attention concerning theoretical identity statements\nhas focused on the area of philosophy of mind. That is next on the\nagenda.\n3.4 Mind\n\nKripke appeals to rigid designation in arguing against the\n identity theory of mind,\n which is really a constellation of theories. A broad division between\nidentity theories can be drawn between type identity theories and\ntoken identity theories: here is a standard Kripkean argument against\ntoken identity theories, which are often thought to be more compelling\nthan type identity theories. Kripke is typically understood to put\nforward something like this argument. \n\nThe Argument Against Token Identity: Suppose that every\nparticular mental event is identical to some particular brain event.\nThen we can take some pain and name it \u2018P\u2019, and\nwe can do the same for the corresponding brain event, calling it\n\u2018C\u2019 (for \u201cc-fiber firing,\u201d assuming\nfor the sake of argument that that is the corresponding brain event).\nAccording to the identity theory, P = C. But in\nreality, P \u2260 C. C could have existed\nwithout P: that very c-fiber firing could have obtained even\nwhile there was no corresponding P. Your c-fibers could have\nbeen blasting away even as you felt nothing at all. In the same way,\nP could have existed without C. You could have felt\nthat same dull, throbbing sensation in your forehead without the\ncorresponding c-fibers having ever acted up. Now, merely showing that\nC could have existed without P and that P\ncould have existed without C does not yet belie\n\u2018P = C\u2019. For this statement might be\ntrue necessarily or contingently. Since P and C\ncould each exist without the other, the statement cannot be\nnecessarily true. But there is still the possibility that the\nstatement is contingently true. There are contingently true\nstatements, as we have seen: e.g., \u2018Hesperus = the brightest\nnon-lunar object in the evening sky\u2019. However, it cannot be that\n\u2018P = C\u2019 is contingently true, as\n\u2018Hesperus = the brightest non-lunar object in the evening\nsky\u2019 is. \u2018Hesperus = the brightest non-lunar object in the\nevening sky\u2019 is contingently true because \u2018Hesperus\u2019\nis a rigid designator and \u2018the brightest non-lunar object in the\nevening sky\u2019 is non-rigid. Because \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018the brightest non-lunar object in the evening sky\u2019\ndesignate the same object at the actual world, \u2018Hesperus = the\nbrightest non-lunar object in the evening sky\u2019 is true; because\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018the brightest non-lunar object in\nthe evening sky\u2019 designate different objects at some other\nworlds, \u2018Hesperus = the brightest non-lunar object in the\nevening sky\u2019 is false at those other worlds. That is why\n\u2018Hesperus = the brightest non-lunar object in the evening\nsky\u2019 is true but contingently so. \u2018P =\nC\u2019, on the other hand, contains two rigid designators.\n\u2018P\u2019 is a name for that very pain, and so rigidly\ndesignates it. \u2018C\u2019 is a name for that very brain\nevent, and so rigidly designates it. Because \u2018P\u2019\nand \u2018C\u2019 are both rigid designators,\n\u2018P = C\u2019 has to be true of necessity if\nit is true at all. Since it is not true of necessity, it is not true\nat all.\n\n\nSome premises in this bare-bones argument are in obvious need of\nsupport, like the modal intuition that P and C could\nhave existed each in the absence of the other. Support has been\nprovided and rejected by different writers. Many philosophers who\nreject anti-materialist arguments along these lines nevertheless make\nuse of rigid designation as a resource in order to frame\nmaterialist views that recognize a parallel between\n\u2018P = C\u2019 and \u2018Water =\nH2O\u2019.\n\nKripke\u2019s views concerning the philosophy of mind could hardly be\ncalled popular. But, as the introduction to an edited volume covering\nthe topic says, \u201cEven authors who disagree with Kripke\u2019s\nfundamental picture tend to present their arguments against an\nimplicitly or explicitly Kripkean backdrop\u201d (Gendler and Hawthorne 2002, p. 26).\n4. Objections to Rigidity\n\nVarious objections to the coherence or usefulness of rigidity have\nbeen put forward by specialists in the philosophy of language, though\nthe objections do not seem to have done much to damage the widespread\nappeal of rigidity, which is commonly taken for granted in mainstream\nliterature from various areas of philosophy. (Whether your typical\nphilosopher is entitled to embrace rigidity is another\nmatter: so there is a case for saying, on grounds independent from the\nforegoing objections, that rigidity and the necessity accompanying it\nstand or fall with a robust version of the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction (see \n note 4).\n If that case is solid, then either popular Quinean antagonism toward\nanalyticity should prompt the rejection of rigidity or else the appeal\nof rigidity should prompt the rejection of the familiar antagonism\ntoward analyticity.) What resistance to rigidity there is may be\naddressed in general terms first, in order to save for its own\nsubsection\n (\u00a74.2)\n treatment of objections specifically directed at the application of\nrigidity to terms for properties, which are especially contended.\n4.1 Objections to Rigidity in General\n\nThere are arguments against the coherence or applicability of\nrigidity for concrete-object designators (for\ndiscussion, see Fitch 2004, pp. 102\u201310), but here we find relative\ncalm. As Hughes says, the position \u201cthat proper names are rigid,\nand that identity statements involving only proper names are\naccordingly necessarily true or necessarily false,\u201d is \u201cas\nclose to uncontroversial as any interesting views in analytic\nphilosophy\u201d (2004, p. vii). \n\nStill, in saying that rigidity is widely favored, we should be\nprepared to qualify in view of those I\u2019ve called \u201cserious\ncounterpart theorists,\u201d who must adopt a revisionist\nunderstanding of what it is for a designator to designate\n\u201crigidly\u201d (or alternatively, they can just frame their\nposition as a rejection of rigidity: e.g., Varzi 2003, already\nquoted). Usually, counterpart theorists are motivated by objections to\nsome of the necessity that rigidity secures, according to the usual\nunderstanding. It appears to some (e.g., Gibbard 1975) that not all\nidentity statements containing just names are necessarily true.\nConsider this scenario: you mold one chunk of clay into the top half\nof a statue, and another chunk of clay into the bottom half. You stick\nthe halves together, thus bringing into existence both a statue, call\nit \u2018David\u2019, and a large lump of clay, call it\n\u2018Lumpl\u2019. Suppose, next, that you explode the statue: both\nDavid and Lumpl go out of existence. It is tempting to say that\n\u2018David = Lumpl\u2019 is true, but not necessarily true. It\ncould have been that: David exists and Lumpl exists but \u2018David\n\u2260 Lumpl\u2019 is true. This would have been the case had Lumpl\nsurvived David: e.g., had you squeezed the clay statue into a ball,\nthereby changing the shape of the relevant lump of clay, instead of\nexploding it, thereby bringing an end to the lump of clay.\n\nIf both \u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019 are rigid\ndesignators, then \u2018David = Lumpl\u2019 is necessarily true\nif it is true in any possible world at all. So, if it is even possible\nthat David \u2260 Lumpl, then David \u2260 Lumpl. David and Lumpl are\ndistinct, however intimately related, because they have different\nmodal properties: Lumpl could instantiate ballhood, while David could\nnot. The rigidity of \u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019\nevidently requires as much. In order to say that \u2018David =\nLumpl\u2019 is contingently true, Gibbard gives up the thesis that\n\u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019 are rigid designators in\nthe usual respect. He maintains that designators are\n\u201crigid,\u201d very loosely speaking, only with respect to a\nsortal: \u2018David\u2019 is statue-rigid, always referring to the\nsame statue, while \u2018Lumpl\u2019 is lump-rigid, always referring\nto the same lump. Accordingly, \u2018Possibly, David is no\nstatue\u2019 is false, while \u2018Possibly, Lumpl is no\nstatue\u2019 is true. What about the object that is, as a\nmatter of fact, both a statue and a lump? For Gibbard, objects have no\nmodal properties and it makes no sense to say that an object in some\nother possible world is identical to an object in the actual world.\nThis is counterintuitive, but again Gibbard does offer a non-standard\nsemantics to accommodate modal talk.\n\nDavid Lewis (1986, chap 4) offers a similar strategy for maintaining\nthat \u2018Possibly, David is no statue\u2019 is false, while\n\u2018Possibly, Lumpl is no statue\u2019 is true. For Lewis, what\nmakes a sentence like the above true or false is whether counterparts\nin other possible worlds associated with \u2018David\u2019 or\n\u2018Lumpl\u2019 are all statues. The use, in discourse, of\ndifferent names like \u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019 can\ncreate different contexts, thus altering the counterparts that come\ninto play in determining the truth of sentences containing the names.\nThe sentences \u2018Possibly, David is no statue\u2019 and\n\u2018Possibly, Lumpl is no statue\u2019 can vary in truth value\nbecause the counterparts relevant to the truth value of the former\nsentence are all statues but the counterparts relevant to the truth\nvalue of the latter sentence are not.\n\nOrthodox rigidity proponents who distinguish between the referents of\n\u2018David\u2019 and \u2018Lumpl\u2019 say that there is more\nthan one object at the same place and time where the statue stands.\nThe intimate relationship between David and Lumpl is usually\nunderstood as one of constitution: David is constituted by\nLumpl. Constitution has been championed by various philosophers to\naddress a variety of related issues (see, e.g., Baker 2000 on personal\nidentity).\n\nAnother possibility, which avoids commitment to constitution, is to\nmaintain an eliminativism about statues or clay lumps. One might\nmaintain that there is no real entity to name \u201cDavid,\u201d in\nthe way that the story above requires; there is only Lumpl in a\nstatuesque form. Accordingly, the problem of accounting for the modal\nstatus of a sentence to which \u2018David\u2019 contributes, like\n\u2018David = Lumpl\u2019, never arises. (For an appeal to\neliminativism to handle various candidates for constitution, see Fitch\n2001, pp. 382\u20133, 391n.5; Hershenov 2005; Merricks 2001.) In\norder to work as a general alternative approach, eliminativism would\nhave to work for all of a wide variety of would-be cases of\nconstitution.\n\nNotice that the unintuitive idea that more than one object can exist\nin the same place at the same time is not necessarily removed if we\naccept contingent identity. Gibbard, for example, acknowledges that\nLumpl and David are distinct objects in any world w in which\nDavid but not Lumpl comes to an end by being squeezed into a ball; but\ndespite the failure of identity to hold between David and Lumpl in\nw, the two share one spatiotemporal location before\nDavid is destroyed because the material of the clay lump that is Lumpl\nis precisely the material of David.\n\nA good collection of papers on this topic is Rea (1997), and a\ngood introduction is his \u201cIntroduction.\u201d\n4.2 Objections to the Application of Rigidity to Terms for Kinds and Properties\n\nBoth Kripke (1980) and Putnam (1975) famously extend the notion of\nrigidity to terms for natural kinds. Here controversy has\nensued. Let us begin with a singular term as an example; general terms\nintroduce additional complications (for discussion, see Linsky 1984;\nSoames 2002; Salmon 2003; 2005).\n\nWhat is rigidly designated by a kind term like \u2018Apis\nmellifera\u2019? Apparently it can not rigidly designate a\nscattered object comprised of all particular honeybees, say, since\nthose honeybees that presently go about their work might not have\nexisted. And others that do not exist might have existed instead (but\ncontroversy and complications attend this observation: see, e.g.,\nG\u00f3mez-Torrente 2006; Zouhar 2009, p. 211). To be rigid, a term\nhas to designate the same thing in all possible worlds.\n\nSome philosophers have proposed that \u2018Apis\nmellifera\u2019 rigidly designates an abstract object, a kind or\nproperty. One might say that \u2018Apis mellifera\u2019\ndesignates the honeybee kind in every possible world: it\nnever designates any other kind, like the bumblebee kind, say. That\nmight be said to make the term rigid. Something similar could be said\nfor \u2018water\u2019, \u2018heat\u2019, and\n\u2018redness\u2019. But a number of objections have been\nissued.\n\nOne broad sort of objection, if it should be called that, is that\nrigidity does, in some respect, the work attributed to it; but\nrigidity is superfluous to the task of explaining that work because\nthe work is the result of other, more fundamental phenomena (for\ndifferent approaches along these lines, see Jylkk\u00e4 2008, pp.\n69\u201372; Schwartz 2002; Soames 2002, e.g., pp. 310\u201311). For all this objection tells, rigidity might remain interesting as a special case of more fundamental phenomena.  More damaging for property rigidity would be its rejection in favor of competing mechanisms alleged to do comparable work (Haukioja 2012; Nimtz 2019).\n\nAn objection more specifically directed toward efforts at extending\nrigidity to expressions for just kinds and properties, is that such\nefforts would also have to extend the status of rigidity to terms for\nartificial kinds or properties (see, e.g., Gl\u00fcer and Pagin\n2011; Haukioja 2012; Nimtz 2019; Schwartz 2002; 2018; 2020; whether this vast application of rigidity should be thought problematic might be questioned:  see e.g., Salmon 2005). The singular terms \u2018soda\npop\u2019, \u2018bachelorhood\u2019, \u2018livestock\u2019 and so\non, would also seem to designate an abstract object rigidly (soda\npop, bachelorhood, livestock, respectively), if terms for natural\nkinds and natural properties do so. So the foregoing proposal for the\nrigidity of kind and property terms might be thought to be too\nindiscriminate in what it allows to be rigid\u2014maybe even so\nindiscriminate that it mistakes sameness of meaning across\npossible worlds, which every meaningful expression enjoys, for\nsameness of designation, which only rigid designators are\nsupposed to have (Schwartz 2002, p. 272; 2020, p. 263n.). \n\nThe basic objection here to our counting certain singular terms\nto be rigid designators for properties might also tell against\ncounting certain general terms to be rigid designators. The\nthesis under fire is that according to which certain general terms\nrigidly designate properties, by virtue of designating the right\nproperty in every possible world. So according to this thesis,\n\u2018watery\u2019, like its singular variant \u2018water\u2019,\nis rigid by virtue of designating water with respect to every possible\nworld: and something similar can be said for \u2018honeybee\u2019,\n\u2018hot\u2019, and \u2018green\u2019. Again, the relevant\nobjection would be that if the foregoing general terms were rigid for\nthat reason, then something similar could be said for general terms\nthat cut more artificially, like \u2018bachelor\u2019; and that is\nsupposed to be a problem. \n\nA second group of objections to extending rigid status to expressions\nfor properties specifically (just tacitly include kinds with\nproperties\u2014kinds are often counted as a sort of property)\ncenters around the idea that the proposal seems committed to\nsubstantive metaphysical positions about abstract objects like kinds\nor properties, concerning which a theory of language ought to remain\nneutral (Devitt 2005; Haukioja 2006; Mart\u00ed 1998, p. 487). For\nexample, the proposal seems committed to rejecting nominalism. Some\ndefenders of property terms\u2019 rigidity are happy so to commit (Linsky\n1984). Other defenders of property terms\u2019 rigidity seek ways of\naccommodating nominalism (Mart\u00ed 1998). \n\nEven if we are happy to commit to properties, problems remain. Just as\na paucity of properties can create problems (nominalism), so can a\nplenum of properties. We\u2019ve already seen that expressions for\nartificial kinds and properties like \u2018livestock\u2019 might\ncreate troubles. There\u2019s a different sort of problem raised by\nstill-more artificial properties: a worry arises that allegedly\nnon-rigid designators for properties always end up rigidly\ndesignating some gruesome relational property or other in the plenum.\nConsider \u2018the biological species typically farmed for\nhoney\u2019, which we might initially be inclined to take for a\nnonrigid designator of Apis mellifera. \u201cIn virtue of\nwhat,\u201d as Devitt would ask (2005, p. 154; see also 2009, p.\n240), does such an expression \u201cnonrigidly designate that,\u201d\ni.e., Apis mellifera, rather than rigidly designate the property\nbeing the biological species typically farmed for honey? This\nproblem has been much discussed. Whether indeed there is a problem\nhere might depend on whether expressions for properties are singular\nterms or whether they are predicative. Arguably the problem is more\ntractable for singular terms than for thoroughly predicative terms,\nwhich seem especially unaccommodating. \n\nFor related reasons, most workers reject any rigid\u2013nonrigid\ndistinction for purely predicative expressions. That would include\n\u2018green\u2019 and \u2018honeybee\u2019, on a\nnominalist\u2019s approach according to which there is no property to\ndesignate and on some realist approaches, too, such as a Fregean\napproach according to which properties exist but cannot be named.\nOther still-more widely accepted candidates for purely predicative\nstatus would be the predicates \u2018is green\u2019, and \u2018is a\nhoneybee\u2019. \n\n\u2018Green\u2019 and \u2018honeybee\u2019 are weaker candidates\nfor purely predicative status than are predicates containing them,\nbecause according to a now-popular view, \u2018green\u2019 or\n\u2018honeybee\u2019 is \u201csingular\u201d in a broad\nsense. That popular view recognizes a \u201c\u2018singular\noccurrence\u2019 of a general term\u201d like \u2018green\u2019\n(Inan 2008, p.227), so that those holding the view do not count\n\u2018green\u2019 to be \u201cpurely predicative\u201d in the\nstrict respect of the foregoing paragraph, even though they might for\nall that count the containing expression \u2018\u2026 is green\u2019 as\npurely predicative (e.g., Soames counts\n\u2018green\u2019/\u2018\u2026 is green\u2019 as singular/predicative\nrespectively), and such theorists might accordingly apply the\nrigid\u2013nonrigid distinction to the singular \u2018green\u2019\nbut not to \u2018\u2026 is green\u2019 (Soames 2010, pp. 90\u201391; 2006, p.\n712; see also Robertson 2009, p. 136n.23). \n\nHow could \u2018green\u2019, a general term, have singular status\ntoo? According to the most commonly cited (but not the only)\nsuggestion along these lines, although general terms are not\nfirst-order singular terms\u2014on the contrary, they\u2019re\ngeneral terms precisely by virtue of being first-order\ngeneral terms\u2014they are higher-order singular terms\n(Linsky 1984; Salmon 2003; 2005). \n\nA few workers maintain both that there are purely predicative general\nterms and that some of them, like \u2018honeybee\u2019, are rigid.\nAccording to a now-familiar suggestion along these lines, what makes\nthe application of a general term F rigid is that any item x to\nwhich the term applies, in any possible world, is part of the\nextension of F in all worlds in which x exists, x\nbeing an F essentially (Cook 1980; Devitt 2005; Devitt and\nSterelny 1999, pp. 85\u20136; G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2006). This\nnotion of rigid application might hold some attraction for someone\nbothered by the objections just mentioned against the view that terms\nrigidly designate properties. It would appear that terms for natural\nkinds but not artificial ones come out rigid: thus,\n\u2018honeybee\u2019 is rigid because any particular honeybee is\nessentially a honeybee and could not have been something else like a\ndragonfly or a fir tree instead. But \u2018livestock\u2019 does not\napply rigidly according to this account because animals that are\nlivestock are not essentially so. Neither does \u2018(is a member of\nthe-/the-) species typically farmed for honey\u2019 apply rigidly\naccording to this account. Furthermore, the account appears to be open\nto nominalism (about properties): nominalists recognize the legitimate\napplication of general terms. \n\nHowever, even if rigid application evades the above difficulties, it\nhas its limitations. One commonly noted problem is this: consider\nidentity statements like \u2018Water = H2O\u2019, or \u2018Red\nlight = light with wavelength 680 nm\u2019. Rigidity is apparently\nsupposed to guarantee the necessity, in case of truth, of identity\nstatements like these. Typically, fans of rigid application rewrite\nidentity statements to have this form: \u2018Anything is (an)\nF if and only if it is (an) F\u2032\u2019. But many\nphilosophers, including proponents of rigid application, have pointed\nout that it could be the case for two general terms F and F\u2032\nthat, (i) necessarily, every F is essentially F and\nevery F\u2032 is essentially F\u2032, so that F and\nF\u2032 are rigid appliers and (ii) in the actual world,\n\u2018Anything is F if and only if it is F\u2032\u2019 is true,\neven though (iii) God might have created an F that is not an\nF\u2032. In that event, \u2018Anything is F if and\nonly if it is F\u2032\u2019 comes out true with respect to\nthe actual world but not necessarily true (for an attempt to get\naround this difficulty, see G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2006).\n\nApart from the foregoing minority suggestion of tying essentialism to\nrigidity, there has not been much done by way of articulating any\npurely predicative version of rigidity; again, prospects for any such\naccount are generally thought to be grim. There is however at least\none rival account of predicative rigidity to compete with the\nforegoing essentialism-centered account of predicative rigidity. The\nproposal follows a lead from Fregeans who recognize \u201cdefinite\nascriptions\u201d (Heintz 1973) for properties corresponding to\ndefinite descriptions for entities they are willing to name. Thus,\nGeach indicates that he would recognize a proper answer to the\nquestion \u201cwhat is the color of Antarctica?\u201d to be\n\u201cclouds, snow, etc.,\u201d or that an English statement like\nthe following is unobjectionable: \u201cHoneybees are the species\ntypically farmed for honey.\u201d In sentences like the\nforegoing, seemingly singular talk about an abstract entity, such as a\n\u201ccolor\u201d or a \u201cspecies,\u201d would have to be\ninterpreted as talk about concrete objects instead: clouds,\nbees, etc. (see, e.g., Anscombe and Geach 1961, pp. 155\u20136). Let\nus suppose, for the sake of argument, that expressions like\n\u2018white\u2019 and \u2018the color of Antarctica\u2019 are\npurely predicative, either because there are no properties to\ndesignate or because they cannot be designated by a singular\nexpression: still, the contrast between a typical one-word\npredicate like \u2018white\u2019 and the foregoing definite\nascription remains of interest for its bearing on the modal and\nepistemological status of biconditionals, in the ways relevant to\nrigidity, according to this line of thinking: compare \u2018Something\nis the color of Antarctica if and only if it is white\u2019 with\n\u2018Something is albescent if and only if it is white\u2019\n(understand \u2018albescent\u2019 as a synonym for\n\u2018white\u2019). That contrast suggests that we might articulate\nan account of rigidity that does not presuppose singular designation\nof any sort (Haze 2021; LaPorte 2013, chapter 5).",
