    "main_text": "McTaggart\u2019s Argument\n4. McTaggart\u2019s Argument\n\nIn a famous paper published in 1908, J.M.E. McTaggart argued that\nthere is in fact no such thing as time, and that the appearance of a\ntemporal order to the world is a mere appearance. Other philosophers\nbefore and since (including, especially, F.H. Bradley) have argued for\nthe same conclusion. We will focus here only on McTaggart\u2019s\nargument against the reality of time, which has been by far the most\ninfluential.\n\nMcTaggart begins his argument by distinguishing two ways in which\npositions in time can be ordered. First, he says, positions in time\ncan be ordered according to their possession of properties like being\ntwo days future, being one day future, being present, being one day\npast, etc. These properties are often referred to now as\n\u201cA properties\u201d because McTaggart calls the series\nof times ordered by these properties \u201cthe A\nseries\u201d. But he says that positions in time can also be ordered\nby two-place relations like two days earlier than, one day earlier\nthan, simultaneous with, etc. These relations are now often called\n\u201cB relations\u201d because McTaggart calls the series of\ntimes ordered by these relations \u201cthe B\nseries\u201d.\n\nMcTaggart argues that the B series alone does not constitute a\nproper time series; the A series is essential to time. His\nreason for this is that he assumes change is essential to time, and\nthe B series without the A series does not involve\ngenuine change (since B series positions are forever\n\u201cfixed\u201d, whereas A series positions are constantly\nchanging).\n\nMcTaggart also argues that the A series is inherently\ncontradictory. For, he says, the different A properties are\nincompatible with one another. No time can be both future and past,\nfor example. Nevertheless, he insists, each time in the A\nseries must possess all of the different A properties, since a\ntime that is future will be present and then will be past. McTaggart\nconcludes that, since neither the A-series nor the B-series can order\nthe time series, time is unreal.\n\nOne response to this argument that McTaggart anticipates involves\nclaiming that it\u2019s not true of any time, t, that t\nis both future and past. Rather, the objection goes, we must say that\nit was future at some moment of past time and will\nbe past at some moment of future time. But this objection fails,\naccording to McTaggart, because the additional times that are invoked\nin order to explain t\u2019s possession of the incompatible\nA properties must themselves possess all of the same A\nproperties (as must any further times invoked on account of these\nadditional times, and so on ad infinitum). Thus, according to\nMcTaggart, we never resolve the original contradiction inherent in the\nA series, but, instead, merely generate an infinite regress of\nmore and more contradictions.\n\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument has had staying power because it organizes\ncrucial debates about the metaphysics of temporal passage, because it\nhints at how those debates connect to further debates about where\nevidence for the time series and the nature of change come from, and\nbecause the difference between A-theoretic and B-theoretic approaches\nto the debate has continued in the intervening century.\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Bradley 1893; Dyke\n2002; McTaggart 1908; Mellor 1998; Prior 1967, 1968.\n",
