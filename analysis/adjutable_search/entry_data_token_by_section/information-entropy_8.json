Its goal is to reject the idea that\nstatistical mechanical entropy is a subjective quantity. The primary\npurpose of the counter-argument is to show that work can be extracted\nwithout needing to have an intelligent being involved. The concept of\ninformation is argued not to carry any real burden in understanding the\nSzilard engine. The measurement can be performed, and the operation of\nthe engine effected, without there needing to be a demon to find out\nthe result of the measurement. The description of the measurement\noutcome as information is superfluous.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Popper-Szilard engine attaches a pulley and weight to each side of\nthe partition, but positions a floor beneath the engine in such a way\nthat when the partition is in the centre of the box, both weights are\nresting on the floor and the pulley is taut. The partition has a hole\nin it, allowing the molecule access to both sides of the engine. At an\narbitrary time, the hole is blocked, without any measurement performed\non the location of the molecule. The collisions of the molecule\nagainst the partition will now exert a force on one or the other\nweight, lifting it against gravity.\n\n\nWhat is frequently left unclear in discussions of these devices is\nwhether a compensating entropy increase must still take place and if\nnot, what implications this has. To some, most notably Feyerabend, no\ncompensation need occur and the argument is continued to claim\nexplicitly the second law of thermodynamics is unconditionally\nviolated. To others, such as Popper, it indicates that the second law\nof thermodynamics is only applicable to large systems with many degrees\nof freedom. The engine is used to demonstrate the domain of validity of\nthermodynamics, in a similar manner to Maxwell's original demon. From\nthis point of view, the Smoluchowski trapdoor may still be viewed as a\nthermodynamic system but the Szilard engine is not. Advances in\ntechnology, such as in nano-technology and quantum computation, may\nrender this argument problematical, as the ability to construct\nreliable devices manipulating the states of individual molecules will,\nif there is not some additional physical constraint, eventually allow\nthe construction of macroscopically large numbers of such devices. If\neach device could reliably, continuously extract even microscopic\namounts of heat, then in aggregate there would again be the production\nof macroscopically significant quantities of work.\n",
