    "main_text": "\n\n\nHannah Arendt (1906\u20131975) was one of the most influential political\nphilosophers of the twentieth century. Born into a German-Jewish\nfamily, she was forced to leave Germany in 1933 and lived in Paris for\nthe next eight years, working for a number of Jewish refugee\norganisations. In 1941 she immigrated to the United States and soon\nbecame part of a lively intellectual circle in New York. She held a\nnumber of academic positions at various American universities until\nher death in 1975. She is best known for two works that had a major\nimpact both within and outside the academic community. The first,\nThe Origins of Totalitarianism, published in 1951, was a\nstudy of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes that generated a wide-ranging\ndebate on the nature and historical antecedents of the totalitarian\nphenomenon. The second, The Human Condition, published in\n1958, was an original philosophical study that investigated the\nfundamental categories of the vita activa (labor, work,\naction). In addition to these two important works, Arendt published a\nnumber of influential essays on topics such as the nature of\nrevolution, freedom, authority, tradition and the modern age. At the\ntime of her death in 1975, she had completed the first two volumes of\nher last major philosophical work, The Life of the Mind,\nwhich examined the three fundamental faculties of the vita\ncontemplativa (thinking, willing, judging).\n",
