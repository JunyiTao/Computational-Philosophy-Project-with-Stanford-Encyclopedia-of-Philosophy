In a sense, the\nconsensus-oriented view of argumentation just discussed is a special\ncase of conflict management argumentation, based on the assumption\nthat the best way to manage conflict and disagreement is to aim for\nconsensus and thus eliminate conflict. But conflict can be\nmanaged in different ways, not all of them leading to consensus;\nindeed, some authors maintain that argumentation may help mitigate\nconflict even when the explicit aim is not that of reaching consensus.\nImportantly, authors who identify conflict management (or variations\nthereof) as a function for argumentation differ in their overall\nappreciation of the value of argumentation: some take it to be at best\nfutile and at worst\n destructive,[5]\n while others attribute a more positive role to argumentation in\nconflict management.\n\nTo this category also belong the conceptualizations of\nargumentation-as-war discussed (and criticized) by a number of authors\n(Cohen 1995; Bailin & Battersby 2016); in such cases, conflict is\nnot so much managed but rather enacted (and possibly\nexacerbated) by means of argumentation. Thus seen, the function of\nargumentation would not be fundamentally different from the function\nof organized competitive activities such as sports or even war (with\nsuitable rules of engagement; Aikin 2011).\n\nWhen conflict emerges, people have various options: they may choose\nnot to engage and instead prefer to flee; they may go into full-blown\nfighting mode, which may include physical aggression; or they may opt\nfor approaches somewhere in between the fight-or-flee extremes of the\nspectrum. Argumentation can be plausibly classified as an intermediary\nresponse:\n\n\n[A]rgument literally is a form of pacifism\u2014we are using words\ninstead of swords to settle our disputes. With argument, we settle our\ndisputes in ways that are most respectful of those who\ndisagree\u2014we do not buy them off, we do not threaten them, and we\ndo not beat them into submission. Instead, we give them reasons that\nbear on the truth or falsity of their beliefs. However adversarial\nargument may be, it isn\u2019t bombing. [\u2026] argument is a\npacifistic replacement for truly violent solutions to\ndisagreements\u2026. (Aikin 2011: 256)\n\n\nThis is not to say that argumentation will always or even typically be\nthe best approach to handle conflict and disagreement; the point is\nrather that argumentation at least has the potential to do so,\nprovided that the background conditions are suitable and that\nprovisions to mitigate escalation are in place (Aikin 2011). Versions\nof this view can be found in the work of proponents of agonistic\nconceptions of democracy and political deliberation (Wenman 2013; see\nentry on\n feminist political philosophy).\n For agonist thinkers, conflict and strife are inevitable features of\nhuman lives, and so cannot be eliminated; but they can be managed. One\nof them is Chantal Mouffe (Mouffe 2000), for whom democratic\npractices, including argumentation/deliberation, can serve to contain\nhostility and transform it into more constructive forms of contest.\nHowever, it is far from obvious that argumentation by itself will\nsuffice to manage conflict; typically, other kinds of intervention\nmust be involved (Young 2000), as the risk of argumentation being used\nto exercise power rather than as a tool to manage conflict always\nlooms large (van Laar & Krabbe 2019).\n",
