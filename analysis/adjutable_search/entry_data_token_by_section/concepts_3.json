    "main_text": "The ontology of concepts || Is the issue merely terminological?\n1.4 Is the issue merely terminological?\n\nStepping back from the details of these three views, there is no\nreason, in principle, why the different views of concepts\ncouldn\u2019t be combined in various ways. For instance, one might\nmaintain that concepts are mental representations that are typed in\nterms of the Fregean senses they express (see Margolis & Laurence\n2007 for discussion).\nOne might also question whether the dispute about ontology is a\nsubstantive dispute. Perhaps there is only a terminological issue\nabout which things ought to be granted the label\n\u201cconcepts\u201d. If so, why not just call mental\nrepresentations \u201cconcepts1\u201d, the relevant\nabilities \u201cconcepts2\u201d, senses\n\u201cconcepts3\u201d, and leave it at that?\n\nHowever, the participants in the dispute don\u2019t generally view it\nas a terminological one. Perhaps this is because they associate their\nown theories of concepts with large-scale commitments about the way\nthat philosophers should approach the study of mind and language.\nUndoubtedly, from Dummett\u2019s perspective, philosophers who\nembrace the mental representation view also embrace RTM, and RTM, as\nhe sees it, is fundamentally misguided. Likewise, from Fodor\u2019s\nperspective, RTM is critical to the study of the mind, so an approach\nlike Dummett\u2019s, which disallows RTM, places inappropriate a\npriori constraints on the study of the mind. Given that the\ndisagreement about concepts is so closely tied to such clearly\nsubstantive explanatory disagreements, the debate about what concepts\nare would itself seem to be a substantive disagreement about what\nsorts of entities are best suited to playing the central explanatory\nroles associated with concepts.\n\nOf course, it is possible to introduce new theoretical terms\n(\u201cconcepts1\u201d,\n\u201cconcepts2\u201d, and\n\u201cconcepts3\u201d) for the different theoretical\nposits made by the different approaches we have been considering (the\nability view, the mental representation view, and the abstract object\nview), and then reconstruct the debate regarding these different\napproaches as a merely terminological disagreement about which of\nthese terms we should use. But notice that it is possible to do the\nsame thing even for clear-cut substantive debates. For example, we\ncould introduce new terms for moral goodness as understood by\ndeontologists (\u201cgood1\u201d) and as understood by\nconsequentialists (\u201cgood2\u201d), and then\nreconstruct the debate about what moral goodness consists in as a\nmerely terminological disagreement about which term we should use,\n\u201cgood1\u201d or \u201cgood2\u201d. Or\nwe could introduce \u201chuman1\u201d for humans as\nunderstood by standard evolutionary accounts (according to which\nhumans have nonhuman primate ancestors) and\n\u201chuman2\u201d for humans understood by creationists\n(according to which they don't), and reconstruct the debate between\nthese different approaches as a merely terminological issue about\nwhich term we should use, \u201chuman1\u201d or\n\u201chuman2\u201d.  The danger, of course, is that this\nwould drain the very idea of a merely terminological debate\nof its utility and obscure very real differences between different\nsorts of disagreements (e.g., stipulative vs. substantive) that would\nall end up counting as \u201cmerely terminological\u201d.\n\nIn the remainder of this entry we will frame questions from the\nperspective of the mental representation view, but readers who prefer\na different view can reframe the issues in their preferred terms.  For\nexample, the questions \u201cCan there be concepts without\nlanguage?\u201d is typically understood on the mental representation\nview as asking whether a pre-linguistic or non-linguistic agent can\nentertain mental representations of a particular kind.  If one adopts\nthe view that concepts are abstract objects, the corresponding\nquestion might be whether a pre-linguistic or non-linguistic agent can\nstand in the concept possession relation to concepts understood as\nabstract objects of a certain type.  And if one adopts the view that\nconcepts are abilities, the corresponding question might be whether a\npre-linguistic or non-linguistic agent can have the abilities that are\nconstitutive of concept possession.\n",
