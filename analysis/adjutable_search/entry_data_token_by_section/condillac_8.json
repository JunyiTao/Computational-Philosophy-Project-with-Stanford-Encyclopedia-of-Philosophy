    "main_text": "Problems with Condillac\u2019s Sensationism || Idealism\n10.1 Idealism\n\nIn the Essay Condillac not only claimed that sensations are\noccasioned by the action of external objects on our sense organs, but\nalso that they are images or representations of those objects. More\nprecisely, he claimed that the objects that affect our sense organs\nmust be extended and hence material things, though they may not have\nthe precise shapes or sizes that our senses represent them as having,\nand though they do not have colours on their surfaces or bear\nqualities of smell and taste (Essay I.i.2.\n\u00a7\u00a711\u201312). But if \u201cwe never leave ourselves and\nnever perceive anything other than our own thoughts,\u201d as\nCondillac claimed at the outset of the Essay (I.i.1.\n\u00a71), then what could entitle us to maintain that our sensations\nbear this degree of resemblance to external objects or that there even\nis an external world containing objects that occasion our sensations?\n\n\nIn the Essay, Condillac contented himself with replying to\nthis question by claiming that while we have a clear idea what it\nmeans to attribute extension to an object, we have no clear idea what\nit means to say that objects are coloured or scented, and that while\nthere is evidence that proves that we do not always perceive the sizes\nor shapes of objects correctly, there is no evidence that proves that\nwe are wrong to think that external objects have some form of\nextension (Essay I.i.2. \u00a7\u00a711\u201313). Neither\nclaim is compelling. Indeed, it is astounding how someone familiar\nwith Descartes\u2019s dreaming argument could have made the latter\none. But both were asserted without any further elaboration or\ndefence. As Diderot later pointed out in his Letter on the\nBlind, for Condillac to rest his case against scepticism about\nthe existence of an external world on such facile grounds was to\nignore the powerful reasons for denying the existence of material\nthings that had been articulated by Berkeley.\n\nThis is not a problem that Condillac rectified in the\nTreatise. Instead, he attempted to side-step it by focusing\njust on the question of how experience leads us to form the idea that\nthere are extended, external objects that bear the qualities of\ncolour, taste, and smell exhibited in our sensations, while eschewing\nany over-confident metaphysical claims about the extent to which this\nidea may be correct. Indeed, towards close of the Treatise he\nadmitted that the question of whether material things exist is not one\nthat we are in any position to answer. We cannot be sure that objects\nare extended, shaped, and mobile, yet colourless, odourless, and\ntasteless. For all we know the objects that cause our sensations may\nnot only be extended and solid, but endowed with qualities that\nresemble our sensations of smell, taste, and colour. Or they may be\nnot only colourless, odourless, and tasteless but unextended\n(Treatise IV.v).\n\nHowever, Condillac had no right to simply-side step the metaphysical\nquestion of the nature of body. His account of how touch instructs the\neyes to see figures and locations describes the hands as extended\nobjects that move through space and touch various parts of the\nextended surfaces of the eyes (Treatise III.iii.1\u20139).\nOne cannot remain agnostic about whether spatially extended objects\nreally exist if one\u2019s theory of perception presupposes that\none\u2019s sense organs are themselves extended and mobile.\n",
