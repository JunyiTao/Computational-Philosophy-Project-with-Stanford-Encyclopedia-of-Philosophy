    "main_text": "The State and the Prince: Language and Concepts\n5. The State and the Prince: Language and Concepts\n\nMachiavelli has also been credited (most recently by Skinner 1978)\nwith formulating for the first time the \u201cmodern concept of the\nstate\u201d, understood in the broadly Weberian sense of an\nimpersonal form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority\nwithin a fixed territorial boundaries. Certainly, the term lo\nstato appears widely in Machiavelli\u2019s writings, especially\nin The Prince, in connection with the acquisition and\napplication of power in a coercive sense, which renders its meaning\ndistinct from the Latin term status (condition or station)\nfrom which it is derived. Moreover, scholars cite Machiavelli\u2019s\ninfluence in shaping the early modern debates surrounding\n\u201creason of state\u201d\u2014the doctrine that the good of the\nstate itself takes precedence over all other considerations, whether\nmorality or the good of citizens\u2014as evidence that he was\nreceived by his near-contemporaries as a theorist of the state\n(Meineke 1924 [1957]). Machiavelli\u2019s name and doctrines were\nwidely invoked to justify the priority of the interests of the state\nin the age of absolutism.\n\nYet, as Harvey Mansfield (1996) has shown, a careful reading of\nMachiavelli\u2019s use of lo stato in The Prince\nand elsewhere does not support this interpretation.\nMachiavelli\u2019s \u201cstate\u201d remains a personal patrimony,\na possession more in line with the medieval conception of\ndominium as the foundation of rule. (Dominium is a\nLatin term that may be translated with equal force as \u201cprivate\nproperty\u201d and as \u201cpolitical dominion\u201d.) Thus, the\n\u201cstate\u201d is literally owned by whichever prince happens to\nhave control of it. Moreover, the character of governance is\ndetermined by the personal qualities and traits of the\nruler\u2014hence, Machiavelli\u2019s emphasis on\nvirt\u00f9 as indispensable for the prince\u2019s success.\nThese aspects of the deployment of lo stato in The\nPrince mitigate against the \u201cmodernity\u201d of his idea.\nMachiavelli is at best a transitional figure in the process by which\nthe language of the state emerged in early modern Europe, as Mansfield\nconcludes.\n\nAnother factor that must be kept in mind when evaluating the general\napplicability of Machiavelli\u2019s theory in The Prince\nstems from the very situation in which his prince of\nvirt\u00f9 operates. Such a ruler comes to power not by\ndynastic inheritance or on the back of popular support, but purely as\na result of his own initiative, skill, talent, and/or strength (all\nwords that are English equivalents for virt\u00f9,\ndependent upon where it occurs in the text). Thus, the Machiavellian\nprince can count on no pre-existing structures of legitimation, as\ndiscussed above. In order to \u201cmaintain his state\u201d, then,\nhe can only rely upon his own fount of personal characteristics to\ndirect the use of power and establish his claim on rulership. This is\na precarious position, since Machiavelli insists that the throes of\nfortune and the conspiracies of other men render the prince constantly\nvulnerable to the loss of his state. The idea of a stable\nconstitutional regime that reflects the tenor of modern political\nthought (and practice) is nowhere to be seen in Machiavelli\u2019s\nconception of princely government.\n\nIndeed, one might wonder whether Machiavelli, for all of his alleged\nrealism, actually believed that a prince of complete\nvirt\u00f9 could in fact exist. He sometimes seems to\nimagine that a successful prince would have to develop a psychology\nentirely different from that known hitherto to mankind, inasmuch as\nthis \u201cnew\u201d prince is\n\nprepared to vary his conduct as the winds of fortune and changing\ncircumstances constrain him and \u2026 not deviate from right\nconduct if possible, but be capable of entering upon the path of\nwrongdoing when this becomes necessary. (MP 62)\n\n\nThis flexibility yields the core of the \u201cpractical\u201d advice\nthat Machiavelli offers to the ruler seeking to maintain his state:\nexclude no course of action out of hand, but be ready always to\nperform whatever acts are required by political circumstance.\n\nYet Machiavelli himself apparently harbored severe doubts about\nwhether human beings were psychologically capable of generating such\nflexible dispositions within themselves. In spite of the great number\nof his historical examples, Machiavelli can point in The\nPrince to no single ruler who evinced the sort of variable\nvirt\u00f9 that he deems necessary for the complete control\nof fortune. Rather, his case studies of successful rulers repeatedly\npoint to the situation of a prince whose characteristics suited his\ntimes but whose consistency of conduct (as in the case of Pope Julius\nII) \u201cwould have brought about his downfall\u201d if\ncircumstances had changed (Prince CW 92). Even the Emperor\nSeverus, whose techniques Machiavelli lauds, succeeded because he\nemployed \u201cthe courses of action that are necessary for\nestablishing himself in power\u201d; he is not, however, to be\nimitated universally (Prince CW 73). Machiavelli\u2019s\nevaluation of the chances for creating a new, psychologically flexible\ntype of character is extremely guarded, and tends to be worded in\nconditional form and in the subjective mood: \u201cIf it were\npossible to change one\u2019s nature to suit the times and\ncircumstances, one would always be successful\u201d (Prince\nCW 91, translation revised). Such observations must make us wonder\nwhether Machiavelli\u2019s advice that princes acquire dispositions\nwhich vary according to circumstance was so \u201cpractical\u201d\n(even in his own mind) as he had asserted.\n",
