These discoveries revolutionized\nthe understanding of mathematics and logic, and had dramatic\nimplications for the philosophy of mathematics. There have also been\nattempts to apply them in other fields of philosophy, but the\nlegitimacy of many such applications is much more controversial.\n\nIn order to understand G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems, one must first\nexplain the key concepts essential to it, such as \u201cformal\nsystem\u201d, \u201cconsistency\u201d, and\n\u201ccompleteness\u201d. Roughly, a formal system is a\nsystem of axioms equipped with rules of inference, which allow one to\ngenerate new theorems. The set of axioms is required to be finite or\nat least decidable, i.e., there must be an algorithm (an effective\nmethod) which enables one to mechanically decide whether a given\nstatement is an axiom or not. If this condition is satisfied, the\ntheory is called \u201crecursively axiomatizable\u201d, or, simply,\n\u201caxiomatizable\u201d. The rules of inference (of a formal\nsystem) are also effective operations, such that it can always be\nmechanically decided whether one has a legitimate application of a\nrule of inference at hand. Consequently, it is also possible to decide\nfor any given finite sequence of formulas, whether it constitutes a\ngenuine derivation, or a proof, in the system\u2014given the axioms\nand the rules of inference of the system.\n\nA formal system is complete if for every statement of the\nlanguage of the system, either the statement or its negation can be\nderived (i.e., proved) in the system. A formal system is\nconsistent if there is no statement such that the statement\nitself and its negation are both derivable in the system. Only\nconsistent systems are of any interest in this context, for it is an\nelementary fact of logic that in an inconsistent formal system every\nstatement is derivable, and consequently, such a system is trivially\ncomplete.\n\nG\u00f6del established two different though related incompleteness\ntheorems, usually called the first incompleteness theorem and the\nsecond incompleteness theorem. \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s\ntheorem\u201d is sometimes used to refer to the conjunction of these\ntwo, but may refer to either\u2014usually the first\u2014separately.\nAccommodating an improvement due to J. Barkley Rosser in 1936, the\nfirst theorem can be stated, roughly, as follows:\n\nFirst incompleteness theorem\n\nAny consistent formal system \\(F\\) within which a certain amount of\nelementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there\nare statements of the language of \\(F\\) which can neither be proved\nnor disproved in \\(F\\).\n\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorem does not merely claim that such statements\nexist: the method of G\u00f6del\u2019s proof explicitly produces a\nparticular sentence that is neither provable nor refutable in\n\\(F\\); the \u201cundecidable\u201d statement can be found\nmechanically from a specification of \\(F\\). The sentence in\nquestion is a relatively simple statement of number theory, a purely\nuniversal arithmetical sentence.\n\nA common misunderstanding is to interpret G\u00f6del\u2019s first\ntheorem as showing that there are truths that cannot be proved. This\nis, however, incorrect, for the incompleteness theorem does not deal\nwith provability in any absolute sense, but only concerns derivability\nin some particular formal system or another. For any statement\n\\(A\\) unprovable in a particular formal system \\(F\\), there are,\ntrivially, other formal systems in which \\(A\\) is provable (take\n\\(A\\) as an axiom). On the other hand, there is the extremely\npowerful standard axiom system of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (denoted\nas ZF, or, with the axiom of choice,\nZFC; see the section on the axioms of ZFC in the\nentry on\n set theory),\n which is more than sufficient for the derivation of all ordinary\nmathematics. Now there are, by G\u00f6del\u2019s first theorem,\narithmetical truths that are not provable even in\nZFC. Proving them would thus require a formal system\nthat incorporates methods going beyond ZFC. There is\nthus a sense in which such truths are not provable using today\u2019s\n\u201cordinary\u201d mathematical methods and axioms, nor can they\nbe proved in a way that mathematicians would today regard as\nunproblematic and conclusive. \n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem concerns the limits\nof consistency proofs. A rough statement is:\n\nSecond incompleteness theorem\n\nFor any consistent system \\(F\\) within which a certain amount of\nelementary arithmetic can be carried out, the consistency of \\(F\\)\ncannot be proved in \\(F\\) itself.\n\n\nIn the case of the second theorem, \\(F\\) must contain a little bit\nmore arithmetic than in the case of the first theorem, which holds\nunder very weak conditions. It is important to note that this result,\nlike the first incompleteness theorem, is a theorem about formal\nprovability, or derivability (which is always relative to some formal\nsystem; in this case, to \\(F\\) itself). It does not say anything\nabout whether, for a particular theory \\(T\\) satisfying the\nconditions of the theorem, the statement \u201c\\(T\\) is\nconsistent\u201d can be proved in the sense of being shown to be true\nby a conclusive argument, or by a proof generally acceptable for\nmathematicians. For many theories, this is perfectly possible.\n",
