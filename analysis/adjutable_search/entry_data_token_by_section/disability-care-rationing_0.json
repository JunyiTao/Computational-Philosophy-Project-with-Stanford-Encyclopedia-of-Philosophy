    "main_text": "The Ethics of Health Care Rationing || Rationing health resources\n1.1 Rationing health resources\n\nWhat are the principal ethical concerns involved in how we allocate\nscarce medical resources to people who can benefit from them? Health\ncare resources (broadly construed to include treatments or\ninterventions, medications, medical and rehabilitative devices, health\ncare services and service providers, health care systems, clinics and\nother settings, and so on) are by their nature scarce resources. They\nare scarce both as a consequence of societal, macro-allocative\ndecisions about how much social resources are put into health care\n(rather than, say, into education, scientific research or fighting\nforeign wars), and because some of these resources, such as\ntransplantable organs, are intrinsically scarce. \n\nScarcity entails that health resource demands will always overwhelm\nsupply, which in turn entails that some method of constrained\nallocation must take place. Rationing is the generic name for this and\nit comes in many forms: implicit or explicit, case-by-case or\nsystematic, rational and fair or the opposite, overt, transparent and\nprofessionally-sanctioned, or hidden, unexamined and rationalized as\nsomething other than rationing. The key point is that rationing is\nunavoidable and always occurs. As health economists insist, since\nrationing of health care resources is inevitable, best it be open,\ntransparently justified and understandable, based on good evidence and\nargument (Ubel 2000). The ethicist agrees, but adds the consideration\nof fairness.\n\nA persuasive criterion of rationality in rationing is efficiency:\nsince supply is not infinite we must ensure that every allocated\nresource is used to achieve the maximum benefit it can provide. While\nin some domains the nature of a \u201cbenefit\u201d is\ncontroversial, here it is obvious: health resources produce health\nbenefits, either incremental improvements in health or the prevention\nof worsening health and premature death. Understanding death (or\npremature death) as the worst health outcome, life-saving or\nlife-prolonging is (usually) a clear health benefit. But so is\nimproving bodily functioning, mitigating or ameliorating functional\nproblems or preventing functional decline. Although death is not\npreventable, disease, injuries, and other challenges to an\nindividual\u2019s health can either be prevented or their impact\nlessened, either indefinitely or for some period of time. Health\noutcomes, in short, are either quantitative (number of years lost to a\nhealth challenge) or qualitative (extent of functioning lost).\n\nIf we define a \u201chealth need\u201d as any decrement in health\n(either years to live or a less-than-optimal level of bodily\nfunctioning), health resource efficiency is a matter of using health\nresources to minimize ill-health in a manner that does not waste\nhealth care resources. In the case of a single individual, there is no\nissue: give the person the resources he or she actually requires and\nnothing more. But resource allocation is only an issue when there is\nmore than one claimant to the same, scarce, resource. Resource\nallocation is a problem of fairness across populations. This leads us\nto the question of distributional fairness where, as we shall see\nbelow, there are various competing options besides CEA. At first\nglance, however, the general efficiency requirement that scarce health\nresources be used to maximize benefit or minimize need seems strongly\nintuitive. \n\nThe intuitive plausibility of the efficiency requirement is the\nmotivation for the rationing strategy based on cost-effectiveness\nanalysis (CEA). The health resource is a cost, the health improvement\na benefit, and intuitively we should try to get as much benefit from\nthe cost as possible. Alternatively put, CEA mandates that the lower\nthe cost per unit of health improvement the more effective the use of\nthe associated health resource. Although this strategy can in\nprinciple be applied to health resource usage at the individual level,\nCEA, reflecting its intellectual heritage as a form of utilitarianism,\nis standardly viewed as a societal strategy in which costs and\nbenefits are aggregated over the population.\n\nIn practice, though, cost-effectiveness analysis in health care\nallocation faces a substantial methodological hurdle: there is a vast\narray of incommensurable health improvements\u2014lowering pain\nlevels in arthritis, improving muscle strength or respiration\nefficiency, controlling high blood pressure, adding a year to life,\npostponing the onset of dementia. Since CEA requires health\nimprovements to be comparable between individuals and across the\npopulation, an underlying health improvement metric\u2014what\nstatisticians call a \u201clatent trait\u201d\u2014needs to be\nidentified that is (at least) ordinal and comparable, if not precisely\nmeasurable. We need to identify, in short, what every health\nimprovement shares in common. That is the measure of a health\nimprovement, and the benefit that factors into the CEA\ncalculation.\n\nThe most commonly used metric is called \u201cquality of\nlife\u201d\u2014every health improvement, whatever else it\naccomplishes, incrementally improves the individual\u2019s quality of\nlife. Given that a health improvement is potentially either\nquantitative or qualitative (extending life or improving life), it is\nnecessary to bring these two facets into a single measure (called,\ngenerically, a summary health measure). A common way of doing this is\nin terms of the econometric concept of quality-adjusted life year or\nQALY. Every health improvement produces a health state with an\nexpected longevity (the number of years left to live) and level of\nfunctioning (the quality of living in that health state). These can be\nmetrically joined into a single score by using the common metric of\nyears lives and discounting the value of a year lived in a particular\nhealth state by the quality of life value of living in that state. If\nfull health is represented by the value of 1, death by 0, then the\nquality of life values of all possible states of health a human can\nexperience can be assigned a number between 1 and 0, and that number\ndetermines the quality of life impact of the health state on a person,\nin terms of some proportion of a full life year. The values for each\nstate can be generated by a population ranking exercise (as was done\nin the Oregon example), by expert consensus, or by means of a variety\nof econometric \u201cpreference elicitation techniques\u201d such as\n\u201cstandard gamble\u201d, \u201cwillingness to pay\u201d or\n\u201cperson trade off\u201d (see Nord 1999 for the details of these\ntechniques in the health domain).\n\nAlthough the most commonly used in health resource prioritization, the\nQALY is not the only health benefit summary measure. The\ndisability-adjusted life year or DALY operates similarly to the QALY,\nalthough conversely in terms of the burden of living with a\ndisability, measured in life-years (see Murray 1996). Here 0 is again\ndeath and 1 full health and a DALY score measures a health state as a\nfunction of life-years lost to disability. To compare the two\nmeasures, if the quality-adjusted factor associated with a health\nstate like spinal cord injury (SCI) is 0.4, then the quality of each\nyear of life post-injury is 0.4 of a year lived in full health. If one\nis expected to live another 30 years, then the overall QALY is 12\nyears. DALYs work the same way, only in reverse: the person with the\nSCI would have the overall life burden of 0.6 times 30 years or 18\ndisability-adjusted life years. (There are other differences between\nthe two measures that are more technical in nature and can be ignored\nin this discussion.)\n\nWhile QALYs are most commonly used as measure of the benefit from\nhealth resources for CEA in health allocation strategies (e.g.,\nUK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\nuses QALYs for quality of care determinations), DALYs have been\nextensively used by the World Health Organization and the World\nBank\u2014and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in\nSeattle, Washington\u2014to determine the population burden of\ndisease and injuries, primarily for public health applications,\nincluding especially national priority setting (Jamison et al. 2006,\nupdated in Das & Samarasekera 2012).\n\nThe natural home of the CEA approach to allocation is at the\ninstitutional or meso-allocative level where decisions are made far\nfrom the individual bedside and are hidden from view in the form of\nhospital reimbursement policies and clinical guidelines. At the\nhighest policy level of macro-allocation where overall national health\nbudgets are developed, only the most technocratic of societies would\nhave an explicit prioritization strategy based on CEA. In most\ndemocratic societies, health care budgets are determined by a complex\ninterplay of politics and bureaucratic pressures. These forces tend to\nallocate more resources to urban areas, focus on curative rather than\npreventive services, and cater to special constituencies or those with\nthe more highly paid lobbyists: all of which is demonstrably\ninefficient. Worse yet, in many countries, health care resource\nmacro-allocation is governed by ability to pay, which is the most\nstraightforwardly inefficient (not to say inequitable) allocation\nstrategy there is. \n\nAt the level of meso-allocation\u2014the distribution of health care\nresources across a single institution, such as a hospital or\nclinic\u2014much of what is called \u201crationing at the\nbedside\u201d is disguised as standard clinical practice (Ubel 2000).\nIf a physician\u2014whether motivated by pressures from hospital\nadministrators, managed care organization or insurance company, or\nmerely excising her or his professional expertise\u2014decides to\nforego live-saving treatment for a patient on the grounds that the\nhealth benefits would not warrant the use of the resource, then the\njudgment clearly reflects, rough and ready, intuitive application of\nCEA. Or if a treatment is not provided because it is judged\n\u201cmedically futile\u201d, that judgment is in effect a\ncost-benefit analysis. Treatments are said to be \u201cfutile\u201d\nwhen in the physician\u2019s judgment the expected health benefits do\nnot sufficiently outweigh the costs of providing the care (Crossley\n1995; Batavia 2002). Similarly, \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d or\nDNR orders, while they may be equally motivated by futility or even\ncompassion, are essentially CEA rationing techniques, although here\nthe judgment is that the resource would have no benefit at all. \n",
