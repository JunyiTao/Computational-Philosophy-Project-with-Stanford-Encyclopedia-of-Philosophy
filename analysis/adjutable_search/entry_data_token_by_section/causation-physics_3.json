    "main_text": "(Neo)-Russellian Challenges || The Vagueness Challenge\n2.1 The Vagueness Challenge\n\nThe nineteenth-century physicists Kirchhoff and Mach objected that\ncausal notions are \u201cinfected by vagueness\u201d (Kirchhoff\n1876: v, my translation) and \u201clack the precision\u201d (Mach\n1905: 278, my translation) of the mathematical functional dependencies\nassociated with physical theories. This criticism is echoed in the\ntwenty-first century by John Norton (2003) and John Earman (2011),\namong others.\n\nWithin the descriptive project the vagueness challenge can be\nunderstood as arguing that our intuitive, commonsense notion or\nnotions of cause are too vague to be given philosophical analyses\nprecise enough to be able to play a legitimate role in the\nmathematized sciences. To the extent that physicists themselves engage\nin causal talk, this has to be understood as part of an informal\nframework within which physicists talk about theories but not as part\nof the formally rigorous and precise content of physical theories\nthemselves (Earman 2011). One could imagine an analogous challenge as\npart of the functional project, even though here the criticism, if\nsuccessful, would point to limits of the project of conceptually\nre-engineering causal notions and would show that causal concepts are\nso vague as to resist sufficient philosophical precissification.\n\nWithin the metaphysical project the vagueness challenge arguably looms\nespecially large for defenders of metaphysically \u201crich\u201d\ncausal notions, such as notions of causal production. Here the\nchallenge may be part of more general empiricist scruples about rich\ncausal notions of production or \u201cbringing about\u201d along the\nlines of what has traditionally been taken to be Hume\u2019s\ncriticism of causation. Yet the vagueness challenge can also be\npresented as a challenge to broadly Humean accounts of causation, such\nas David Lewis\u2019s account (Lewis 1973).\n\nOn most accounts of causation causal claims closely track\ncounterfactual claims. But counterfactual claims are notoriously vague\nand appear to be highly context-dependent. Consider the following\nexample of how the vagueness challenge for counterfactual claims may\narise in combination with the time-asymmetry challenge: imagine a\nfully elastic collision between two billiard balls on a frictionless\nplane. What, if anything, can single out putatively causal\ncounterfactuals of the form \u201cIf the balls\u2019 initial state\nprior to the collision had been different, their final state after the\ncollision would be different\u201d from putatively anti-causal\nbacktracking counterfactuals of the form \u201cIf the balls\u2019\nfinal state were different, their initial state would have to have\nbeen different\u201d? Newton\u2019s laws underwrite both kinds of\ncounterfactual equally: just as different initial states are\nassociated with different final states, differences in the\nsystem\u2019s final state have to be correlated with differences in\nthe initial state. Within the context of an initial value problem, in\nwhich the initial state of the balls is given and Newton\u2019s laws\nare used to calculate the subsequent motion of the balls, the former\ntype of counterfactual is the appropriate one, while the context of a\nfinal value problem (which asks us to calculate the balls\u2019 prior\nmotion given their final state) suggests the latter type of\ncounterfactual.\n\nSimilarly, we might ask if hitting one of the balls with a hammer\nexactly as they collide will result in changes to the balls\u2019\nmotion after they collide or before they collide.\nIntuitively it seems that the force exerted by the hammer will\ncausally influence the ball\u2019s subsequent motion. But it is not\nobvious how this verdict is borne out purely by considering\nNewton\u2019s equations: singling out the forward-looking\ncounterfactual as the correct one seems arbitrary. As John Earman\nargues,\n\n\nthe exercise of trying to divine the truth value of such\ncounterfactual assertions, even when it is agreed at the outset what\nthe basic laws are, is an invitation to a contest of conflicting\nintuitions about cotenability of conditions and the closeness of\npossible worlds. (Earman 2011: 494)\n\n\nDavid Lewis proposes an answer to this concern, arguing that the\ntime-asymmetry of counterfactuals is secured by an asymmetric\noverdetermination of the present by the future (Lewis 1979), but\nLewis\u2019s overdetermination thesis is false in the context of the\ndeterministic theories he considers (Frisch 2005: ch. 8; Loewer 2007).\n\n\nA successful response to the vagueness challenge would have to show\nthat there exist causal notions that can be reconstructed in a manner\nsufficiently precise to allow these notions to play a role in\nmathematized sciences such as physics. Bayes-net or structural\naccounts of causation (Pearl 2000; Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 1993\n[2000]) take up this challenge (see\n section 3\n below).\n",
