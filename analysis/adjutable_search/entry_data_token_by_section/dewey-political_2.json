Democratic Ideals and Realities\n\nWhile democracy is the key organising concept of Dewey\u2019s\npolitical philosophy, it is one that he thinks of in a very unusual\nway. As he puts it in Democracy and Education, it is\n\u201cmore than a form of government; it is primarily a mode of\nassociated living, of conjoint communicated experience\u201d\n(MW9, 93) or, famously, it is a \u201cway of life\u201d\n(Freedom and Culture, LW13, 155; \u201cCreative\nDemocracy: The Task Before Us\u201d, LW14, 226). This is a\nlong way from the conception of democracy as majority rule or as a set\nof procedures for the selection of governors.\n\nDewey views democracy as an ideal of associated life in the sense that\nas an ideal he thinks that it reconciles the full expression of\nindividual potentialities and the common good. In this sense, democracy\nsits at the apex of his historicised naturalist account of\nindividuality and community. \u201cFrom the standpoint of the\nindividual\u201d, as he puts it, democracy \u201cconsists in having\na responsible share according to capacity in forming and directing the\nactivities of the groups in which one belongs and in participating\naccording to need in the values which the groups sustain\u201d, while\n\u201cfrom the standpoint of the groups, it demands liberation of the\npotentialities of members of a group in harmony with the interests and\ngoods which are common\u201d (The Public and Its Problems,\nLW2, 327\u20138). In working out what to do, individuals and\ngroups are confronted by dilemmas. Some of us (such as a gang of\nthieves, in Dewey\u2019s example) address these problems in ways that\npromote certain kinds of growth and development (you can flourish as a\nthief, including feeling solidarity with your gang) but inherently\nfrustrate ourselves and our goals, since these set us on paths of\nactivity that necessarily generate conflict with other individuals and\ngroups, and so the need for coercion. It is only a democratic\ncommunity, Dewey believes, which allows each member fully to realize\nher potentialities without conflict and coercion, since it does not\ninherently generate conflict. Dewey is explicit that this ideal\ndescribes a problem that societies confront and a\ncritical ideal for them to attain, namely, how to harmonize the\ndevelopment of each individual with the maintenance of a society in\nwhich the individual activities will contribute to the common good\n(Ethics, 2nd edition, LW7, 350), rather\nthan the blueprint for an institutional solution. Dewey\u2019s point\nis that (unlike externally imposed moral standards) this ideal is\nimmanent to democratic societies, since what makes them democratic is\nthe extent to which they overcome the barriers (of class and race, for\nexample (Democracy and Education, MW9, 93)) to free\ninteraction. As critics point out, this does not furnish a reason for\nsomeone who lacks an interest in overcoming those barriers to do so.\nPerhaps, though, Dewey should not be viewed as striving to provide\nsuch a reason, at this very general level, beyond pointing out that\nthose who are antipathetic to other classes and races should not claim\nto be democrats.\n\nAn overlapping but not identical fashion in which democracy\nconstitutes a way of life for Dewey concerns his view of the scope of\ndemocracy: democracy does not only govern what we think of as politics\nor administration, in the normal sense. Dewey thinks that this narrow\nview misses out the importance of democracy for a much wider range of\nsocial institutions: it is \u201csuperficial\u201d to think that\n\u201cgovernment is located in Washington and Albany. There is\ngovernment in the family, in business, in the church, in every social\ngroup\u201d which regulates the behaviour of its members\n(\u201cDemocracy and Educational\nAdministration\u201d, LW11, 221). The scope of democracy, in\nthe sense of the range of institutions to which it applies, should not\nbe construed narrowly. If our individuality is shaped by the wide\nrange of institutions that make up our social habitat, as Dewey\nthinks, then the rules and norms governing these institutions are too\nimportant to us to be left to chance, dogma, tradition or inherited\nhierarchy. Power and domination are present in all these spheres of\nsocial life so restricting democratic scrutiny and control to a single\nsphere of social life would be a mistake. In The Public and Its\nProblems, Dewey gives the question of the scope of politics some\nsystematic thought and provides this account of the distinction\nbetween public and private:\n\nWhen the consequences of an action are confined, or are thought to be\nconfined mainly to the persons directly engaged in it, the transaction\nis a private one \u2026. Yet if it is found that the consequences\n\u2026 extend beyond [those] directly concerned \u2026 the act\nacquires a public capacity \u2026 The line between private and\npublic is to be drawn on the basis of the extent and scope of the\nconsequences of acts which are so important as to need control,\nwhether by inhibition or promotion. The public consists of all those\nwho are affected by the indirect consequences of transactions to such\nan extent that it is deemed necessary to have these consequences\nsystematically cared for.  (LW2, 244\u20136)\n\n\nWhat constitutes the public (and private) in particular cases is\nrelative to range of judgments about what counts as a consequence, who\nis concerned, and what is so important as to need control, and the\npublic is a concept we have to deploy these judgments. So this\nconception of the public/private distinction fits with his\nexperimentalism by leaving very open the content of these judgments.\nAs we saw in the discussion of liberalism, in part Dewey objects to\nclassical liberalism because he thinks it has an overly restrictive\nview of what constitutes a constraint on individual liberty, grounded\nin an ahistorical conception of the individual. If we really\ncollectively value individuality, Dewey thinks, we should think not\nonly about how to protect some sorts of act from regulation (so are\n\u201cprivate\u201d) but also about where we need to intervene and\nregulate in order to support individuality.\n\nFurther, \u201c[d]emocracy is only estimable through the changed\nconception of intelligence that forms modern science\u201d\n(\u201cIntelligence and Morals\u201d, MW4, 39); it is a\nkind of social embodiment of his conception of experimentalism.\n\u201cThe very heart of political democracy is adjudication of social\ndifferences by discussion and exchange of views\u201d, he writes in a\nlate essay. \u201cThis method provides a rough approximation to the\nmethod of effecting change by means of experimental inquiry and\ntest\u201d (\u201cChallenge to Liberal Thought\u201d,\nLW15, 273). Democracy is a method for identifying and solving\nthe common problems confronted by communities. Robust inquiry requires\nthat we must have access to all the available evidence and arguments.\nIf we want our inquiry to be successful, we should not prejudge its\noutcomes, by excluding sources of experience that allow us to explore\nand correct our hypotheses. By contrast,\n\n[e]very authoritarian scheme, \u2026 assumes that its value may be\nassessed by some prior principle, if not of family and birth or race\nand color or possession of material wealth, then by the position and\nrank the person occupies in the existing social scheme. The democratic\nfaith in equality is the faith that each individual shall have the\nchance and opportunity to contribute whatever he is capable of\ncontributing, and that the value of his contribution be decided by its\nplace and function in the organized total of similar contributions:\n\u2013 not on the basis of prior status of any kind whatever.\n(\u201cDemocracy and Educational Administration\u201d,\nLW11, 220)\n\n\nAlthough the \u201cdemocratic faith\u201d suggests that we are all\ncapable of meaningfully contributing to critical inquiry, the\ndevelopment of habits of intelligent conduct isn\u2019t taken for\ngranted: they can be degraded by social disempowerment, propaganda and\nideology. And, as we\u2019ve seen, they are in any case viewed as\nhard-won achievements of schooling and a generally supportive society.\nDemocratic societies are thought of as both seeking to attain\ndesirable goals, and arguing over how to do so, and also as arguing\nover what a desirable goal is. In other words, democratic politics is\na mode of activity in which we can arrive at a conception of what our\ninterests are. Accordingly, like recent deliberative democrats, Dewey\nascribes a central importance to discussion, consultation, persuasion\nand debate in democratic decision-making. As the experimentalist\nconception of inquiry insists, this does not imply that we need a\npriori criteria in order to establish if this process has been\nsuccessful. Rather, criteria for what counts as a satisfactory\nsolution may be hammered out in the process of searching for one.\nDemocracy is experimental for Dewey in that it allows, or should\nallow, a profound questioning of the id\u00e9es fixes of\nthe established order, even if, of course, much democratic politics\nwill not take the form of such questioning. Further, it is worth\nunderlining that Dewey does not conflate this kind of\ndeliberative politics with the elimination of social conflict, and so\nwith the critical ideal of democracy in his social ontology. He\ndoesn\u2019t imagine away differences of opinion, conflicts of\ninterest and value pluralism as ineliminable features of social and\npolitical life. Even where there is open public discussion,\n\u201c[d]ifferences of opinion in the sense of differences of\njudgment as to the course which it is best to follow, the policy which\nit is best to try out, will still exist\u201d (The Public and Its\nProblems, LW2, 362). Democracy as public discussion is\nviewed as the best way of dealing with the conflict of interests in a\nsociety:\n\nThe method of democracy \u2013 inasfar as it is that of organized\nintelligence \u2013 is to bring these conflicts out into the open\nwhere their special claims can be discussed and judged in the light of\nmore inclusive interests than are represented by either of them\nseparately. (Liberalism and Social Action, LW11, 56)\n\n\nA concern with the epistemic costs and risks of social and political\nhierarchy runs through Dewey\u2019s work: such \u201csocial\ndivisions as interfere with free and full intercourse react to make\nintelligence and knowing of the separated classes one-sided\u201d\n(Democracy and Education, MW9, 354). It is not only\nthat some classes are excluded from cultural capital and education or\nsubjected to propaganda: \u201call special privilege narrows the\noutlook of those who possess it, as well as limits the possibilities\nof development of those not having it\u201d (Ethics,\n2nd edition, LW7, 347). Rationalization of your\nown superior position as well as wilful ignorance of others\u2019\nsituation are central epistemic vices of this kind of hierarchy. This\nanxiety about hierarchy underlies the response to Walter\nLippmann\u2019s influential sceptical attack on democratic theory in\nbooks such as Public Opinion (1922) and The Phantom\nPublic (1925). Lippmann (who like Dewey was influenced by William\nJames and who shared many philosophical and political commitments with\nDewey at an earlier stage of his career) agrees that contemporary\nmoral and political thinking has not caught up with the modern world.\nUnlike Dewey, however, Lippmann thinks that understanding the\ncomplexity and opacity of modern societies requires us to set aside\nthe illusion entertained by classical democratic theorists that\ncitizens are \u201comnicompetent\u201d, capable of arriving at\ninformed judgments about politics, and instead embrace the legitimacy\nof decision-making by qualified experts. The force of this critique of\ndemocracy for Dewey in part derives from its deployment of his own\nintellectual strategy for ends with which he vehemently disagrees. In\nthis context, although Dewey can sometimes appear to sound dismissive\nabout what he calls the \u201cpolitical machinery\u201d of democracy\nsuch as the vote and majority rule, he never regards this as\ninessential or disposable. At the minimum, for Dewey, this machinery\nhelps to protect individuals from putative experts about where the\ninterests of people lie. Dewey\u2019s response to this is to point\nout that experts have their own biases, and need correction from those\nwho have to live with the consequences of their decisions: \u201cin\nthe absence of an articulate voice on the part of the masses, the best\ndo not remain the best, the wise cease to be wise \u2026. In the\ndegree to which they become a specialized class, they are shut off\nfrom knowledge of the needs they are supposed to serve\u201d. So the\nmerit of even existing \u201crudimentary\u201d forms of democracy is\nthat they compel \u201crecourse to methods of discussion,\nconsultation and persuasion\u201d and in so doing provide the\nopportunity to improve decisions (The Public and Its\nProblems, LW2, 364; cf. Reconstruction in\nPhilosophy, MW12, 164). Taken in isolation, this way of\nviewing the desirability of democratic political machinery seems\ninstrumental and minimal; instrumental, in that the desirability of\ndemocracy derives from its protecting the interests of each individual\nagainst the depredations of an elite class, and minimal, in that the\nrationale for popular participation is limited to the need to keep the\nelite informed about where the shoe pinches, if its policies are not\nto be misguided. In spite of his scathing tone, Dewey is committed to\nimproving this machinery (by supporting the equal distribution of the\nfranchise, for example) rather than merely dismissing it as\nunimportant. The real target of his ire is the exclusive\nidentification of democracy with a particular current set of political\ninstitutions, particularly only with elections and majority rule. As\nin the case of the defunct idea of liberalism, Dewey thinks of this as\na once liberating conception that now contains an inbuilt conservative\nbias that prevents us from seeing the relevance of democracy to wider\nsocial terrain, such as the workplace, and constrains more imaginative\ninstitutional thinking.\n",
