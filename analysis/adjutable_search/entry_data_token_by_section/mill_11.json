    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Practical Philosophy || Mill\u2019s Conception of Happiness\n4.2 Mill\u2019s Conception of Happiness\n\nWe have seen, then, that Mill holds that \u201chappiness is the sole\nend of human action, and the promotion of it the test by which to\njudge of all human conduct\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 237).\nThe content of this claim, however, clearly depends to a great extent\nupon what is meant by happiness. Mill gives what seems to be\na clear and unambiguous statement of his meaning. \u201cBy happiness\nis intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain,\nand the privation of pleasure\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n210). That statement has seemed to many to commit Mill, at a basic\nlevel, to hedonism as an account of happiness and a theory of\nvalue\u2014that it is pleasurable sensations that are the\nultimately valuable thing.\n\nMill departs from the Benthamite account, however, which holds that if\ntwo experiences contain equal quantities of pleasure, then they are\nthereby equally valuable. In contrast, Mill argues that \n\n\n[i]t would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things,\nquality is considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures\nshould be supposed to depend on quantity alone.\n(Utilitarianism, X: 211) \n\n\nSome pleasures are, by their nature, of a higher quality than\nothers\u2014and as such are to be valued more.\n\n\nIf I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or\nwhat makes one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a\npleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one\npossible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or\nalmost all who have experience of both give a decided preference\n[\u2026] that is the more desirable pleasure.\n(Utilitarianism, X: 211)\n\n\nThe claim is one purely relating to value ordering\u2014that there\ncan exist experiences h and l, such that h\nis more valuable than l, despite l containing an\nequal or greater quantity of pleasure than h. Some\ncommentators (Riley 2002) have\nclaimed that Mill holds that any quantity of a higher\npleasure is more valuable than any quantity of a lower\npleasure on the basis of the following passage:\n\n\nIf one of the two [pleasures] is, by those who are competently\nacquainted with both, placed so far above the other that they prefer\nit [\u2026] and would not resign it for any quantity of the other\npleasure which their nature is capable of, we are justified in\nascribing to the preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality.\n(Utilitarianism, X: 211)\n\n\nThe claim that it would be rational to sacrifice any amount\nof a lower pleasure for a minuscule amount of a higher pleasure,\nthough, seems too implausible to attribute to Mill\u2014and in the\npassage cited, he only registers a sufficient condition for\nconsidering one pleasure of a higher quality to another, and not a\nnecessary condition (Saunders 2011; Miller 2010: 58). In\nfact, Mill gives very little indication as to how to weigh quality\nagainst quantity of pleasure\u2014he simply does not speak to the\nspecifics of how varying quantities of pleasures at varying qualities\nare to be reconciled against one another.\n\nThe question remains as to which sorts of pleasures are of\nhigher quality than others. Mill holds that pleasures \u201cof the\nintellect, of the feelings and imagination, and of the moral\nsentiments\u201d are amongst the higher pleasures\n(Utilitarianism, X: 211). But Mill\u2019s doctrine need not\nbe read as restrictively intellectualist. As well as pleasures of the\nmind, he holds that pleasures gained in activity are of a\nhigher quality than those gained passively (Liberty,\nXVIII: 262; cf. Utilitarianism, X: 215). Ultimately, however,\nthe quality of any given pleasure must itself be a substantive\nquestion, to be addressed by ongoing experimentation and comparison of\nthe preferences of competent judges\u2014those who have experienced,\nand appreciated, the sorts of pleasure being compared.\n\nThe lurking suspicion for many has been that in distinguishing\nqualities of pleasure, Mill departs from hedonism. If Mill\nclaims that a small amount of pleasure can be more valuable\nthan a high amount, anti-hedonist interpreters suggests, it\nmust be on the grounds of valuing something apart from the\npleasurable experience itself\u2014for if Mill valued solely\nthe pleasurable experience, then he would always value more\npleasurable experience over less. Mill must, that is to say, consider\nhigh quality pleasures more valuable not on account of their\npleasantness, but on some other grounds\u2014i.e., their source. But\nthis would be to abandon hedonism. The anti-hedonist interpretation\nmight be further supported by appealing to Mill\u2019s talk of\n\u2018parts of happiness\u2019. As was noted above, when defending\nthe claim that happiness is the sole end of action, Mill acknowledges\nthat \u201c[t]he ingredients of happiness are very various, and each\nof them is desirable in itself\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n235). While talk of (for instance) virtue as a part of\nhappiness is certainly intelligible, it is perhaps less obvious that\nit is compatible with his hedonism.\n\nThose who doubt whether Mill remains a hedonist have in general\nclaimed that Mill moves towards a eudaimonistic or\nperfectionist account of happiness (Brink 2013: 46ff.;\nNussbaum 2004; Clark 2010). By \u2018happiness\u2019, they claim,\nMill does not mean certain experiences or\nsensations, but rather the flourishing that is achieved in\nthe realization of a character ideal. There are occasions when Mill\nmakes claims which lend themselves to such an interpretation. When, in\nOn Liberty, Mill emphasizes the value of autonomy and\noriginality\u2014when he claims that \u201c[i]t really is of\nimportance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are\nthat do it\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 263)\u2014his focus does\nseem to be on the value of being a certain way, rather than\nthe value of experiences.\n\nIt is certainly true that, in attempting to combine the best of\neighteenth-century empiricism and nineteenth-century romanticism, Mill\ngravitated towards character as the locus of practical\ntheorizing (Devigne 2006). This, by necessity, involved a change of\nemphasis in his philosophy. The question, however, is whether\nMill\u2019s focus on character is simply an instance of his attempt\nto elicit \u201cdynamical conclusions\u201d from \u201cmechanical\npremises\u201d (Letter to Thomas Carlyle, XII:\n181)\u2014whether, in other words, his attempt is to rest a\ncharacter-focused ethic upon hedonistic foundations. The claim that\nsome qualities of pleasure are more valuable than others need not\nviolate the core claim of hedonism: that pleasurable experiences are\nthe ultimately valuable things. It is perfectly open to the hedonist\nto claim that different pleasurable experiences are, on the grounds of\ntheir phenomenology, of different value. Mill\u2019s associationism\nprovides the resources to claim that pleasures are themselves complex\nand evolving emotions, reflective of, and often entangled with, the\ncharacters that give rise to them. This too may offer some explanation\nof what Mill means by claiming that, for instance, virtue can become\npart of our happiness. Given Mill\u2019s profession that\n\n\n\nall desirable things [\u2026] are desirable either for the pleasure\ninherent in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure and\nthe prevention of pain, \n\n\nthen, there seems little reason to doubt his commitment to hedonism\n(Utilitarianism, X: 210).\n",
