Two Recent Traditional Treatments\n\nMore recent philosophers have agreed that God\u2019s presence is to\nbe understood analogically.\n Charles Hartshorne\n (1897\u20132000), for example, claims that \u201cthe relation of\nGod to the world must necessarily be conceived, if at all, by analogy\nwith relations given in human experience\u201d (1941). Rather than\ntaking the relations to be knowledge of and power over things,\nhowever, Hartshorne assumes that God\u2019s relation to the world is\nanalogous to that of a human mind\u2019s relation to its body.\n\nHartshorne develops this idea by making distinctions between kinds of\nknowledge and kinds of power. Some things that human beings know are\nknown immediately, by \u201cvivid and direct intuition\u201d, while\nother things are known only indirectly or through inference.\nHartshorne holds that the former kind of knowledge is infallible, and\nit is the kind of knowledge human beings have of their own thoughts\nand feelings. Since this kind of knowledge is the highest form of\nknowledge, it is the kind God has, and he has it with respect to the\nentire cosmos.\n\nSimilarly, some things human beings have power over they control\ndirectly; other things can be controlled only indirectly. Human beings\nhave direct control only over their own volitions and movements of\ntheir own bodies. Again, since this is the highest kind of power, it\nis the kind of power God has\u2014and he has it over every part of\nthe universe.\n\nThus far Hartshorne may be seen as developing the medieval view of\ndivine presence. God is present everywhere by having\nimmediate knowledge and direct power throughout the\nuniverse (with the addition that his presence extends to unoccupied\nregions of space). But Hartshorne endorses a surprising addition. He\nadds that whatever part of the world a mind knows immediately and\ncontrols directly is, by definition, its body. The world, therefore,\nis God\u2019s body.\n\nRichard Swinburne (1977) also begins his discussion of omnipresence by\nasking what it is for a person to have a body. Although he insists\nthat God is an immaterial spirit, he supposes this claim to be\ncompatible with a certain \u201climited embodiment.\u201d\nSubsequently (2016) he withdraws this suggestion, saying that since\n\u201cGod is not supposed to be tied down to acting or learning\nthrough \u2026 [the universe] or any chunk of matter \u2026 it\nseems less misleading to say that he is not embodied.\u201d Swinburne\ndevelops his account by appeal to the notions of a \u201cbasic\naction\u201d (an action one performs, for example, moving ones limbs\nin the typical case, without having to perform another action in order\nto do it) and of \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d (knowledge that is\nneither inferential nor dependent on causal interaction). He then\npresents the claim that God is omnipresent as the claim that God\n\u201ccan cause effects at every place directly (as an instrumentally\nbasic action) and knows what is happening at every place without the\ninformation coming to him through some causal chain\u2014for example,\nwithout needing light rays from a distant place to stimulate his\neyes\u201d (2016, p. 113). Swinburne\u2019s account is thus, as he\nnotes, in the spirit of that of Aquinas.\n",
