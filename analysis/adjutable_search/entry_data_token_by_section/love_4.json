    "main_text": "Love as Valuing || Love as Appraisal of Value\n4.1 Love as Appraisal of Value\n\nVelleman (1999, 2008) offers an appraisal view of love, understanding\nlove to be fundamentally a matter of acknowledging and responding in a\ndistinctive way to the value of the beloved. (For a very different\nappraisal view of love, see Kolodny 2003.) Understanding this more\nfully requires understanding both the kind of value of the beloved to\nwhich one responds and the distinctive kind of response to such value\nthat love is. Nonetheless, it should be clear that what makes an\naccount be an appraisal view of love is not the mere fact that love is\nunderstood to involve appraisal; many other accounts do so, and it is\ntypical of robust concern accounts, for example (cf. the quote from\nTaylor\n above,\n Section 3). Rather, appraisal views are distinctive in\nunderstanding love to consist in that appraisal.\n\nIn articulating the kind of value love involves, Velleman, following\nKant, distinguishes dignity from price. To have a price, as\nthe economic metaphor suggests, is to have a value that can be\ncompared to the value of other things with prices, such that it is\nintelligible to exchange without loss items of the same value. By\ncontrast, to have dignity is to have a value such that\ncomparisons of relative value become meaningless. Material goods are\nnormally understood to have prices, but we persons have dignity: no\nsubstitution of one person for another can preserve exactly the same\nvalue, for something of incomparable worth would be lost (and gained)\nin such a substitution.\n\nOn this Kantian view, our dignity as persons consists in our rational\nnature: our capacity both to be actuated by reasons that we\nautonomously provide ourselves in setting our own ends and to respond\nappropriately to the intrinsic values we discover in the world.\nConsequently, one important way in which we exercise our rational\nnatures is to respond with respect to the dignity of other persons (a\ndignity that consists in part in their capacity for respect):\nrespect just is the required minimal response to the dignity\nof persons. What makes a response to a person be that of respect,\nVelleman claims, still following Kant, is that it \u201carrests our\nself-love\u201d and thereby prevents us from treating him as a means\nto our ends (p. 360).\n\nGiven this, Velleman claims that love is similarly a response to the\ndignity of persons, and as such it is the dignity of the object of our\nlove that justifies that love. However, love and respect are different\nkinds of responses to the same value. For love arrests not our\nself-love but rather\n\nour tendencies toward emotional self-protection from another person,\ntendencies to draw ourselves in and close ourselves off from being\naffected by him. Love disarms our emotional defenses; it makes us\nvulnerable to the other. [1999, p. 361]\n\n\nThis means that the concern, attraction, sympathy, etc. that we\nnormally associate with love are not constituents of love but are\nrather its normal effects, and love can remain without them (as in the\ncase of the love for a meddlesome relative one cannot stand being\naround). Moreover, this provides Velleman with a clear account of the\nintuitive \u201cdepth\u201d of love: it is essentially a response to\npersons as such, and to say that you love your dog is therefore to be\nconfused.\n\nOf course, we do not respond with love to the dignity of every person\nwe meet, nor are we somehow required to: love, as the disarming of our\nemotional defenses in a way that makes us especially vulnerable to\nanother, is the optional maximal response to others\u2019 dignity.\nWhat, then, explains the selectivity of love\u2014why I love some\npeople and not others? The answer lies in the contingent fit between\nthe way some people behaviorally express their dignity as persons and\nthe way I happen to respond to those expressions by becoming\nemotionally vulnerable to them. The right sort of fit makes someone\n\u201clovable\u201d by me (1999, p. 372), and my responding with\nlove in these cases is a matter of my \u201creally seeing\u201d this\nperson in a way that I fail to do with others who do not fit with me\nin this way. By \u2018lovable\u2019 here Velleman seems to mean\nable to be loved, not worthy of being loved, for\nnothing Velleman says here speaks to a question about the\njustification of my loving this person rather than that. Rather, what\nhe offers is an explanation of the selectivity of my love, an\nexplanation that as a matter of fact makes my response be that of love\nrather than mere respect.\n\nThis understanding of the selectivity of love as something that can be\nexplained but not justified is potentially troubling. For we\nordinarily think we can justify not only my loving you rather than\nsomeone else but also and more importantly the constancy of my love:\nmy continuing to love you even as you change in certain fundamental\nways (but not others). As Delaney (1996, p. 347) puts the worry about\nconstancy:\n\nwhile you seem to want it to be true that, were you to become a\nschmuck, your lover would continue to love you,\u2026you also want\nit to be the case that your lover would never love a schmuck.\n\n\nThe issue here is not merely that we can offer explanations of the\nselectivity of my love, of why I do not love schmucks; rather, at\nissue is the discernment of love, of loving and continuing to\nlove for good reasons as well as of ceasing to love for good reasons.\nTo have these good reasons seems to involve attributing different\nvalues to you now rather than formerly or rather than to someone else,\nyet this is precisely what Velleman denies is the case in making the\ndistinction between love and respect the way he does.\n\nIt is also questionable whether Velleman can even explain the\nselectivity of love in terms of the \u201cfit\u201d between your\nexpressions and my sensitivities. For the relevant sensitivities on my\npart are emotional sensitivities: the lowering of my emotional\ndefenses and so becoming emotionally vulnerable to you. Thus, I become\nvulnerable to the harms (or goods) that befall you and so\nsympathetically feel your pain (or joy). Such emotions are themselves\nassessable for warrant, and now we can ask why my disappointment that\nyou lost the race is warranted, but my being disappointed that a mere\nstranger lost would not be warranted. The intuitive answer is that I\nlove you but not him. However, this answer is unavailable to Velleman,\nbecause he thinks that what makes my response to your dignity that of\nlove rather than respect is precisely that I feel such emotions, and\nto appeal to my love in explaining the emotions therefore seems\nviciously circular.\n\nAlthough these problems are specific to Velleman\u2019s account, the\ndifficulty can be generalized to any appraisal account of love (such\nas that offered in Kolodny 2003). For if love is an appraisal, it\nneeds to be distinguished from other forms of appraisal, including our\nevaluative judgments. On the one hand, to try to distinguish love as\nan appraisal from other appraisals in terms of love\u2019s having\ncertain effects on our emotional and motivational life (as on\nVelleman\u2019s account) is unsatisfying because it ignores part of\nwhat needs to be explained: why the appraisal of love has these\neffects and yet judgments with the same evaluative content do not.\nIndeed, this question is crucial if we are to understand the intuitive\n\u201cdepth\u201d of love, for without an answer to this question we\ndo not understand why love should have the kind of centrality in our\nlives it manifestly\n does.[9]\n On the other hand, to bundle this emotional component into the\nappraisal itself would be to turn the view into either the robust\nconcern view\n (Section 3)\n or a variant of the emotion view\n (Section 5.1).\n",
