    "main_text": "The Completeness of the Quantum Mechanical Description\n1. The Completeness of the Quantum Mechanical Description\n\nConceptual difficulties have plagued quantum mechanics since its\ninception, despite its extraordinary predictive successes. The basic\nproblem, plainly put, is this: It is not at all clear what quantum\nmechanics is about. What, in fact, does quantum mechanics describe?\n\n\nIt might seem, since it is widely agreed that any quantum mechanical\nsystem is completely described by its wave function, that quantum\nmechanics is fundamentally about the behavior of wave functions. Quite\nnaturally, no physicist wanted this to be true more than did Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger, the father of the wave function. Nonetheless,\nSchr\u00f6dinger ultimately found this impossible to believe. His\ndifficulty had little to do with the novelty of the wave function:\n\n\n\nThat it is an abstract, unintuitive mathematical construct is a\nscruple that almost always surfaces against new aids to thought and\nthat carries no great message. (Schr\u00f6dinger [1935] 1980: 327)\n\n\n\nRather, it was that the \u201cblurring\u201d that the spread out\ncharacter of the wave function suggests \u201caffects macroscopically\ntangible and visible things, for which the term \u2018blurring\u2019\nseems simply wrong\u201d.\n\nFor example, in the same paper Schr\u00f6dinger, echoing Einstein  in the 1927 Solvay discussions (pp. 440\u201341 in Bacciagaluppi & Valentini 2009),   noted that it may\nhappen in radioactive decay that\n\n\nthe emerging particle is described \u2026 as a spherical wave\n\u2026 that impinges continuously on a surrounding luminescent\nscreen over its full expanse. The screen however does not show a more\nor less constant uniform surface glow, but rather lights up at\none instant at one spot \u2026. (Schr\u00f6dinger\n[1935] 1980: 327\u2013328) \n\n\nAnd he observed that one can easily arrange, for example by including\na cat in the system, \u201cquite ridiculous cases\u201d with \n\n\nthe \\(\\psi\\)-function of the entire system having in it the living and\nthe dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal\nparts. (Schr\u00f6dinger [1935] 1980: 328) \n\n\nIt is thus because of the \u201cmeasurement problem\u201d, of\nmacroscopic superpositions, that Schr\u00f6dinger found it difficult\nto regard the wave function as \u201crepresenting reality\u201d. But\nthen what does? With evident disapproval, Schr\u00f6dinger observes\nthat\n\n\nthe reigning doctrine rescues itself or us by having recourse to\nepistemology. We are told that no distinction is to be made between\nthe state of a natural object and what I know about it, or perhaps\nbetter, what I can know about it if I go to some trouble.\nActually\u2014so they say\u2014there is intrinsically only\nawareness, observation, measurement. (Schr\u00f6dinger [1935] 1980:\n328) \n\n\nMany physicists pay lip service to the  Copenhagen interpretation\u2014that quantum mechanics is fundamentally about\nobservation or results of measurement. But (with the exception of the proponents of QBism) it is becoming increasingly\ndifficult to find any who, when pressed, will defend this\ninterpretation. It seems clear that quantum mechanics is fundamentally\nabout atoms and electrons, quarks and strings, not those particular\nmacroscopic regularities associated with what we call\nmeasurements of the properties of these things. But if these\nentities are not somehow identified with the wave function\nitself\u2014and if talk of them is not merely shorthand for elaborate\nstatements about measurements\u2014then where are they to be found in\nthe quantum description?\n\nThere is, perhaps, a very simple reason why it is so difficult to\ndiscern in the quantum description the objects we believe quantum\nmechanics ought to describe. Perhaps the quantum mechanical\ndescription is not the whole story, a possibility most prominently\nassociated with Albert Einstein. (For a general discussion of\nEinstein\u2019s scientific philosophy, and in particular of his\napproach to the conflicting positions of realism and positivism, see\nthe entry on\n Einstein\u2019s philosophy of science.)\n\nIn 1935 Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen defended this\npossibility in their famous EPR paper. They concluded with this\nobservation:\n\n\nWhile we have thus shown that the wave function does not provide a\ncomplete description of the physical reality, we left open the\nquestion of whether or not such a description exists. We believe,\nhowever, that such a theory is possible. (Einstein et al. 1935: 780)\n\n\n\nThe argument that the EPR paper advances to support this conclusion\ninvokes quantum correlations and an assumption of locality. (See the\nentries on\n the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument in quantum theory\n and on\n quantum entanglement and information.)\n\nLater, on the basis of more or less the same considerations as those\nof Schr\u00f6dinger quoted above, Einstein again concluded that the\nwave function does not provide a complete description of individual\nsystems, an idea he called \u201cthis most nearly obvious\ninterpretation\u201d (Einstein 1949: 672). In relation to a theory\nincorporating a more complete description, Einstein remarked that \n\n\nthe statistical quantum theory would \u2026 take an approximately\nanalogous position to the statistical mechanics within the framework\nof classical mechanics. (Einstein 1949: 672) \n\n\nWe note here, and show below, that Bohmian mechanics exactly fits this\ndescription.\n",
