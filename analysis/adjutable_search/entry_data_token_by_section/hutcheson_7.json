    "main_text": "Hutcheson\u2019s Normative Ethics || Virtue and Utility\n2.2 Virtue and Utility\n\nHutcheson is often recognized as an early figure in the development of\ncontemporary utilitarianism. Indeed, it was Hutcheson who first used\nthe phrase, in identifying the nature of moral goodness, that acts\nshould promote \u201cthe greatest happiness for the greatest\nnumber\u201d. He writes, in the Inquiry, that \n\n\nthat Action is best, which procures the greatest Happiness for the\ngreatest Numbers; and that, worst, which, in like manner, occasions\nMisery. (Inquiry, 125)\n\n\nBut is Hutcheson really a utilitarian? And if so, what sort of\nutilitarian is he?\n\nTo begin, there are passages in Hutcheson that sound quite\nutilitarian, indeed. In the early editions of the Inquiry,\nHutcheson suggests a quasi-mathematical principle by which to \n\n\ncompute the Morality of any Actions, with all their Circumstances,\nwhen we judge of the Actions done by our selves, or by others.\n(Inquiry, 128) \n\n\nHe holds that \n\n\nThe moral Importance of any Agent, or the Quantity of publick Good\nproduced by him, is in a compound Ratio of his Benevolence and\nAbilitys: or (by substituting the Letters for the Words, as M = Moment\nof Good, and \u03bc = Moment of Evil) M = B \u00d7 A.\n(Inquiry, 128) \n\n\nDeriving, then, that a person\u2019s benevolence is determined by\nM/A, Hutcheson declares that \n\n\nmust be the Perfection of Virtue where M = A, or when the Being acts\nto the utmost of his Power for the public Good. (Inquiry,\n130) \n\n\n(It should be noted that the fourth edition of the Inquiry\nrefrains from this technical language, but the general idea remains\nthe same. See Inquiry, 234n56.)\n\nNow this sounds as if Hutcheson is espousing a relatively\nstraightforward utilitarianism. After all, the morality of an action\nis determined, on this view, by whether or not an agent produces the\ngreatest \u201cpublick Good\u201d he or she can. In addition,\n\u201cPublick Good\u201d, here, is understood by Hutcheson to mean\nthe \u201cnatural Good of Mankind\u201d (Inquiry, 91) where\n\u201cnatural good\u201d (more on this later) is understood to mean\na person\u2019s happiness, defined in hedonistic terms\n(Inquiry, 86; Essay, 87). Putting this all together,\nwe get a standard, run-of-the-mill, hedonistic utilitarianism.\n\nHowever, there are major deviations from a straightforward\nutilitarianism as we might understand it from, e.g., Bentham or\nSidgwick (see Albee 1896: 32\u201335). First, Hutcheson appears to\noffer us something like a scalar utilitarianism. On a scalar\nview, there is no absolute rightness or wrongness, but rather degrees\nof rightness or wrongness that an action may display (see Norcross\n2020). And while Hutcheson does discuss the notion of \u201cperfect\nvirtue\u201d\u2014achieved when the good one has the ability to do\nis equal to the good one does\u2014he admits that there will be\ndegrees of virtue (which simply follows given his mathematical\ncalculations), and does not describe the perfection of virtue as any\nsort of absolute obligation (see Darwall 1997: 87\u201388). (Indeed,\nthis point is essential to his critique of Wollaston,\n \u00a71.4.)\n\nSecond, Hutcheson clearly intends his moral \u201ccalculation\u201d\nto refer, at least in part, to the motivation of a given\naction. Only actions motivated by benevolence will be perfectly\nvirtuous. If one is motivated by self-interest, or has a mixed\nmotivation, the extent to which the action was motivated by\nself-interest will be deducted from the overall moral character of an\naction: \n\n\nwhen the Moment of Good, in an Action partly intended for the Good of\nthe Agent, is but equal to the Moment of Good in the Action of another\nAgent, influenc\u2019d only by Benevolence, the former is less\nvirtuous; and in this Case the Interest must be deducted to find he\ntrue Effect of the Benevolence. (Inquiry, 129) \n\n\nSo Hutcheson clearly means to hold that any \u201cpublick good\u201d\nthat is to be credited to the moral quality of an act must be\nintended.\n\nThird, Hutcheson holds that the consequences of a particular act will\nhave no bearing on its moral quality not just if it is not intended,\nbut also if it is not foreseen: \n\n\nIt is true indeed, that that publick Evil which I neither certainly\nforesee, nor have actual Presumptions of, as the Consequence of my\nAction, does not make my present Action Criminal, or Odious; even\naltho I might have foreseen this Evil by a serious Examination of my\nown Actions; because such actions do not, at present, evidence either\nMalice, or want of Benevolence\u2026In like manner, no good Effect\nwhich I did not actually foresee and intend, makes my Action morally\nGood. (Inquiry, 131).\n\n\nThe second and third deviations from a standard utilitarianism might\nbe expected given his affirmed belief that the motivation of virtuous\nactors is paramount in understanding the virtue of their action. As\nalready noted, Hutcheson holds that the moral sense approves actions\ninsofar as they are motivated by disinterested benevolence. Thus far\none might state his version of utilitarianism as a kind of scalar\nmotivational utilitarianism (which we should think of as clearly\ndistinct from a \u201cmotive\u201d utilitarianism (see Adams 1976),\naccording to which morally appropriate actions are motivated by\ndispositions the possession of which leads to the best consequences),\naccording to which an act is virtuous insofar as the agent\naims at the greatest overall good.\n\nBut there is one interesting twist that is briefly suggested by\nHutcheson that is also worth mentioning. Hutcheson holds that the\nperfectly benevolent, and hence perfectly virtuous, agent will aim at\nthe greatest public good they can achieve. But the \u201cpublick\ngood\u201d here should not be understood as a straightforward\naggregate of happiness across persons. In describing his understanding\nof public good, Hutcheson says this:\n\n\nIn comparing the moral Qualitys of Actions, in order to regulate our\nElection among various Actions propos\u2019d, or to find which of\nthem has the greatest moral Excellency, we are led by our moral Sense\nof Virtue to judge thus; that in equal Degrees of Happiness, expected\nto proceed from the Action, the Virtue is in proportion to the Number\nof Persons to whom the Happiness shall extend; (and here the Dignity,\nor moral Importance of Persons, may compensate Numbers) and in equal\nNumbers, the Virtue is as the Quantity of the Happiness, or natural\nGood; or that the Virtue is in a compound Ratio of the Quantity of\nGood, and Number of Enjoyers\u2026Again, when the Consequences of\nActions are of a mix\u2019d Nature, partly Advantageous, and partly\nPernicious; that Action is good, whose good Effects preponderate the\nevil, by being useful to many, and pernicious to few; and that, evil,\nwhich is otherwise. Here also the moral Importance of Characters, or\nDignity of Persons may compensate Numbers; as may also the Degrees of\nHappiness or Misery: for to procure an inconsiderable Good to many,\nbut an immense Evil to few, may be Evil; and an immense Good to few,\nmay preponderate a small Evil to many. (Inquiry, 125)\n\n\nTwo things are worth noting here. First, and less interestingly, the\nphrase \u201ccompound Ratio of the Quantity of Good, and Number of\nEnjoyers\u201d suggests that Hutcheson is inclined toward a form of\naverage utilitarianism, rather than total\nutilitarianism (see Smart & Williams 1974: 27\u201328; Parfit\n1984: 420\u2013421). Furthermore, and compatible with this form of\naverage utilitarianism, Hutcheson holds that small benefits spread\nover many persons need not compensate for massive evils subjected to\nfew, and that small evils spread over many may be a price worth paying\nfor large benefits for a small number. All this is compatible with\nstandard forms of utilitarian aggregation.\n\nBut, more interestingly, Hutcheson suggests that the \u201cDignity,\nor moral Importance of Persons, may compensate Numbers\u201d. How to\nunderstand this passage? One might interpret it as a proto version of\na view according to which the moral virtue of individuals is\nintrinsically significant, the happiness of two people, one of whom is\nvirtuous, the other vicious, are not of equal value. (One might\ncompare this to a form of \u201cluckism\u201d as advocated by, e.g.,\nRichard Arneson [2004].) But Hutcheson explicitly denies this reading\none paragraph earlier. He writes:\n\n\nThe moral Beauty, or Deformity of Actions, is not alter\u2019d by the\nmoral Qualitys of the Objects, any further than the Qualitys of the\nObjects increase or diminish the Benevolence of the Action, or the\npublick Good intended by it. Thus Benevolence toward the worst\nCharacters, or the Study of their Good, may be as amiable as any\nwhatsoever; yea often more so than that toward the Good, since it\nargues such a strong Degree of Benevolence as can surmount the\ngreatest Obstacle, the moral Evil in the Object. (Inquiry,\n124)\n\n\nFor Hutcheson, any \u201ccompensation\u201d the moral worth of\nindividuals is allowed in comparison to numbers must be understood to\nbe pragmatic: \n\n\nYet when our Benevolence to the Evil, encourages them in their bad\nIntentions, or makes them more capable of Mischief; this diminishes or\ndestroyes the Beauty of the Action, or even makes it evil, as it\nbetrays a Neglect of the Good of others more valuable.\n(Inquiry, 124) \n\n\nIn addition, in the System, Hutcheson holds that it is more\nimportant to benefit friends, family, and people \u201cof eminent\nvirtue\u201d in comparison to strangers, but notice that only when\nall other circumstances are equal is one permitted to favor such\nindividuals (see System, 247\u20138).\n\nBut this is puzzling. It would appear that any attention we pay to the\nmoral worth of the objects of our beneficence is simply given the\ngeneral consequences such beneficence may produce. And hence it would\nappear that the \u201cmoral Importance of Persons\u201d is not\nactually \u201ccompensating\u201d numbers at all. Rather, the moral\nimportance of persons is or perhaps could be an important causal\nfactor in the overall production of happiness or the overall\ndistribution of happiness, but is not itself a compensatory\naxiological variable. But this is also puzzling, insofar as Hutcheson\nseems to treat the moral importance of persons as such a variable\ntwice. At this point Hutcheson\u2019s embrace, or\nlack thereof, of luckism must be left as an interpretive puzzle.\n",
