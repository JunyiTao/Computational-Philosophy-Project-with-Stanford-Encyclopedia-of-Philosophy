    "main_text": "\n\nA number of philosophical schools in different parts of the ancient\nworld held that the universe is composed of some kind of\n\u2018atoms\u2019 or minimal parts, albeit for different reasons.\nAlthough the modern term \u2018atom\u2019 derives from the ancient\nGreek adjective atomos, which literally means\n\u2018uncuttable\u2019, it is possible that the first theories we\ncan describe as atomist were developed in classical Indian philosophy.\nWhile the ancient Greeks from whom we derive the modern term were\ntheorizing about the fundamental constituents of the natural world,\nphilosophical discussions have embraced various forms of minima,\nindivisible units or building blocks. Scholarly uses of the term\n\u2018atomism\u2019 range over mereological theories in widely\ndifferent contexts (Zilioli 2021); not all possible senses of the term\nare discussed here. Several ancient atomist theories are treated in\nmore depth in other articles in this encyclopedia: the reader is\nreferred to individual entries for detailed discussions by the\nrelevant experts (see the list of related entries at the end of this\narticle).\n\nThe term \u2018atomism\u2019 is sometimes understood to refer to\ntheories explaining changes in the material world by the\nrearrangements of minute particles of matter, or to the idea that any\nkind of magnitude\u2014geometrical extension, time and space\u2014is\ncomposed of indivisible parts. Theories of mathematical minima were\nformulated in response to paradoxes like those of Zeno of Elea (early\n5th c. BCE) about infinite divisibility of magnitudes.\nHowever, theories of smallest parts could be introduced for reasons\nquite distinct from mathematical problems about divisibility: atomism\nin classical Indian philosophy seems to have been motivated by the\ndesire to reflect the categories used in analysis of the metaphysical\nstructure of reality shown in language (Carpenter 2021). While in the\nGreek tradition, atoms were held to be eternal and indestructible\nparticles that persist through changes in the visible world of\nexperience, that is not always a feature of ancient atomist theories.\nSome Indian philosophical systems held that atoms are created and\nsubject to transformation or destruction, or that they are only\nmomentary features of experience. Atomists from monotheistic\nschools\u2014including medieval Islamic kal\u0101m\nphilosophers and seventeenth century figures like Pierre\nGassendi\u2014adapted atomist theories to allow for the creation and\ndestruction of atoms by God. Some scholars (Pyle 1997) treat a\nparticular strand of atomist thought as an ideal type, yet the\ndiversity of atomist thought seems to belie this stricture\n(L\u00fcthy, Murdoch and Newman 2001).\n\nThe interactions of particles too small to observe is a compelling way\nto account for perceptible changes in the natural world. Even\nAristotle\u2014often cast as the arch-enemy of atomism\u2014allowed\nthat there might be a lower limit to the quantity of matter that could\ninstantiate certain properties. But not all atomist theories were\nbased on an appearance/reality distinction: Buddhist philosophers\nposited phenomenal instants with minimum extension in time as well as\nspace, to mirror the ephemerality of moments of human experience. Void\nspaces between atoms sometimes, but not always, feature in atomist\ntheories.\n",
