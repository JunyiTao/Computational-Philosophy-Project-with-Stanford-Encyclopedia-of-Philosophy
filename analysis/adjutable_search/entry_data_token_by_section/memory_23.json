Beyond Individual Memory\n\nWhile most research on the metaphysics of memory has assumed that\nremembering is something done by individuals on their own, this\nassumption has recently been challenged, as researchers have drawn on\naccounts of cognition as distributed or extended to interrogate the\nrole of external memory and on ideas from the burgeoning\ninterdisciplinary field of memory studies to investigate the\npossibility of more or less robustly collective forms of\nmemory.\n",
