    "main_text": "Idealist Ethics\n3. Idealist Ethics\n\nThe remaining three books of the Prolegomena concern issues\nin moral psychology and ethical theory. Green criticizes forms of\nethical naturalism that attempt to ground morality in a science of\ndesire and pleasure. In particular, he targets those in the\nutilitarian tradition who defend hedonism. He rejects the hedonist\nconception of motivation, arguing that moral agents have capacities\nfor practical reason that allow them to distinguish between the\nintensity and authority of their desires, to deliberate about their\ndesires, and to regulate their action in accordance with their\ndeliberations. Agents needn\u2019t act on their strongest desires;\nthey can and should act on the basis of a judgment about what it is\nbest for them to do. This, Green claims, is to act on a conception of\none\u2019s own overall good. Here, Green aligns himself with the\nGreek eudaimonist tradition, which he interprets in terms of\nself-realization. Because Green derives the demand for\nself-realization from an understanding of agency itself, he regards\nits demands as categorical, rather than hypothetical, imperatives.\nSelf-realization for Green requires self-consciousness, which requires\nproper cognizance of others. In this way, he agrees with those Greeks,\nsuch as Aristotle, who claim that the proper conception of the\nagent\u2019s own good requires a concern with the good of others,\nespecially the common good. However, Green thinks that the Greeks had\ntoo narrow a conception of the common good. It is only with\nChristianity and enlightenment philosophical views, especially Kantian\nand utilitarian traditions in ethics, Green thinks, that we have\nrecognition of the universal scope of the common good. This leads\nGreen to claim that full self-realization can take place only when\neach rational agent regards all other rational agents as ends in\nthemselves on whom his own happiness depends. In such a state, there\ncan be no conflict or competition among the interests of different\nrational agents. Green links self-realization and freedom; freedom is\nbest understood in terms of self-determination and self-realization.\nBecause Green thinks that self-realization aims at the common good, he\nthinks that freedom also aims at the common good. Green concludes that\nmoral progress consists in the gradual realization of this sort of\nfreedom, which requires the progressive realization of the common\ngood.\n",
