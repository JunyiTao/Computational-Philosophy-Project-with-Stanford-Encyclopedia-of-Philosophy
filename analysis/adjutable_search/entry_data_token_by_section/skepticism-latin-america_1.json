    "main_text": "Historical Background\n2. Historical Background\n\nContemporary studies of skepticism began in Latin America thanks to\nthe works of Oswaldo Porchat and Ezequiel de Olaso, a distinguished\nArgentinian historian of philosophy. Due to their works, skepticism\nhas attracted a significant, although somewhat scattered, amount of\nattention in Latin America. Both were already interested in skepticism\nbefore they met for the first time. In 1968, Porchat gave a famous\nlecture, published in the following year, in which he called attention\nto a basic skeptical problem that every philosopher should try to\novercome: the problem of the conflict of philosophies (roughly, the\nfact that philosophical doctrines often disagree on their answers to\nany given philosophical question). Given his B.A. in classics and his\nPh.D. dissertation on Aristotle\u2019s conception of science, it is\nnot surprising that Porchat came to know ancient skepticism very well.\nHis perspective was philosophical, and he identified his own\nphilosophical experience with that of the ancient skeptics. In the\nsame year of 1969, Olaso defended his Ph.D. dissertation on\n\u201cLeibniz and the Ancient Skeptics\u201d at Byrn Mawr College\n(Pennsylvania), in which he showed that Leibniz had a deep knowledge\nof Greek skepticism, whose modes he clearly identified in the\nCartesian arguments. Thus, one can say that skepticism in Latin\nAmerican began in the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn 1975, invited by Porchat, Olaso went to Brazil where he became a\nprofessor at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) until 1977.\nThis fact had a profound influence on the development of the studies\nof skepticism in both countries and even in other Latin American\ncountries. Their mutual collaboration proved very fruitful.\nPhilosophers interested on skepticism soon got in touch, for they\norganized seminal conferences on the topic (1986, in Campinas, Brazil;\nin 1992, in Buenos Aires, Argentina; unfortunately, no proceedings\nwere published). Throughout the years, many other conferences on\nskepticism were held (in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico) in which\nphilosophers from many countries took part and collective books on\nskepticism appeared.\n\nPorchat\u2019s and Olaso\u2019s influence was huge. They were the\nfounding fathers of skepticism in Latin America. One can speak of a\nsecond generation that was in touch from the 1990s onwards because\nthey paved the way first. Philosophers in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico,\nand Colombia have been collaborating in the last twenty years because\nthey both inaugurated a friendly, collaborative way of doing\nphilosophy that has been preserved by their followers. Though Olaso,\nPorchat and some of their disciples were in touch with many\nphilosophers from other countries and had a far-reaching influence,\nthere is no single, integrated explanation for that widespread\ninterest.\n\nThere is no doubt that skepticism flourished in Brazil like in no\nother Latin American country. It is perhaps not amiss to say that\nPorchat\u2019s neo-Pyrrhonism is the most important achievement of\nLatin American skepticism, providing material for further systematic\ndiscussions. In Brazil, an important group of philosophers around\nPorchat was organized throughout the country in the 1980s, and they\nwere devoted not only to understand the history of skepticism but also\nto discuss contemporary skepticism, by developing it and criticizing\nit. The group held conferences every year, sometimes twice a year, and\nmany books, individual monographs and edited collections, were\npublished. Moreover, Porchat was professor and supervisor of a number\nof young philosophers as well as a reference to all other philosophers\nstudying skepticism. Even philosophers who were not primarily\ninterested in skepticism found the group\u2019s way of doing\nphilosophy quite attractive. In fact, the group has always\nsystematically invited non-skeptical philosophers to enrich its\ndiscussions. As a result, as time went by, the group grew larger and\nlarger.\n\nArgentina, Mexico, and Colombia have also shown a lot of interest in\nskepticism with many important contributions to it, albeit perhaps not\nas systematically as in Brazil. In Argentina, work on skepticism\nremained at first somewhat confined to Olaso and to some historians of\nmodern philosophy around him. Later, there has been a growing interest\nin Argentina, this time from philosophers belonging to the analytic\ntradition, who were (and still are) also in touch with the Brazilian\ngroup, including, more recently, a new impulse to the study of ancient\nskepticism.\n\nIn Mexico, there is also a deep interest in skepticism. History of\nskepticism was not neglected, as we can be seen from the works of\nLaura Ben\u00edtez and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Robles, among others,\nboth of whom worked with Olaso (and Popkin). Their focus is on modern\nskepticism. Some Mexican philosophers, working within a Kantian\ntradition, focused on transcendental arguments as weapons against\nskepticism. Others work on contemporary skepticism in connection to\nquestions such as disjunctivism and perception. Finally, skepticism\nand its connections to fallibilism and skeptical or epistemic\nconcepts, such as doubt and certainty, were a major\ntheme of some Mexican philosophers.\n\nThere has also been some interest in skepticism in many other\ncountries, most notably in Colombia. Usually, this interest is\ncombined with a classic author, such as Descartes, Hume, or Kant, or\nwith an analytic philosopher, like Wittgenstein or Dennett. More\nrecently, an interest in ancient skepticism has also arisen. In other\ncountries such as Peru, Chile and Uruguay, the interest in skeptical\nissues is more scattered. No more than a minor or incidental interest\nin either the history of skepticism or in current epistemological\nquestions that bear on the skeptical challenge is found.\n",
