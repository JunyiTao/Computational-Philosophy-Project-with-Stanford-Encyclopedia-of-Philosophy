Peirce\u2019s Early Account: 1867\u20138.\n\nPeirce\u2019s earliest significant attempt at an account of signs comes in\nhis 1867 paper \u201cOn A New List of Categories\u201d (W2\n.49\u201358). In that account, we find the same basic sign structure\noutlined above: any sign, or representation as Peirce calls it at this\nearly stage, will have a sign-vehicle, an object, and an interpretant.\nAn important difference here though is how he thinks of the relation\nbetween signs and interpretants. In particular, Peirce thought that\nwhilst our interpreting the signifying relation between sign and\nobject relied upon understanding the basis of signification in any\ngiven case, he also thought that the generated interpretant itself\nfunctioned as a further, more developed sign of the object in\nquestion. And of course, as a further sign, it will also signify that\nobject through some features, which again, we must interpret, and\ngenerate a further interpretant. As will be obvious, this leads to an\ninfinite chain of signs. If any sign must generate an interpretant in\norder to be a sign, and any sign is itself the interpretant of some\nfurther sign, then clearly, there must be an infinity of signs both\nproceeding and preceding from any given instance of signification.\nSome scholars (for example, Short 2004; 2007) think that\ninfinite semiosis is a characteristic only of Peirce\u2019s early account.\nOthers, (Liszka 1996, Savan 1988) treat infinite semiosis as present\nin all of Peirce\u2019s accounts. We shall return to the issue of infinite\nsemiosis in the early account below. First, we shall look at the types\nof sign to which Peirce\u2019s early account gives rise.\n\nPeirce thought that \u201crepresentations\u201d generate further\ninterpretants in one of three possible ways. First, via \u201ca mere\ncommunity in some quality\u201d (W2 .56). These he calls likenesses,\nbut they are more familiarly known as icons. Second, those\n\u201cwhose relation to their objects consists in a correspondence in\nfact\u201d (W2 .56) are termed indices. And finally, those\n\u201cwhose relation to their objects is an imputed character\u201d\n(W2. 56) are called symbols. Put simply, if we come to\ninterpret a sign as standing for its object in virtue of some shared\nquality, then the sign is an icon. Peirce\u2019s early examples of icons\nare portraits and noted similarities between the letters p and b (W2.\n53\u20134). If on the other hand, our interpretation comes in virtue\nof some brute, existential fact, causal connections say, then the sign\nis an index. Early examples include the weathercock, and the\nrelationship between the murderer and his victim (W2. 53\u20134). And\nfinally, if we generate an interpretant in virtue of some observed\ngeneral or conventional connection between sign and object, then the\nsign is a symbol. Early examples include the words \u201chomme\u201d\nand \u201cman\u201d sharing a reference. (W2. 53\u20134).\n\nThis, then, is the very first outing for Peirce\u2019s famous division of\nsigns into Icons, Indexes, and Symbols. Although Peirce\u2019s precise\nthoughts about the nature of this division were to change at various\npoints in his development of sign theory, the division nonetheless\nremains throughout his work. There are, however, some important\nfeatures to this early account that mark it out from the later\ndevelopments. We shall look at two of these features here: the\nimportance of thought-signs; and infinite semiosis.\n",
