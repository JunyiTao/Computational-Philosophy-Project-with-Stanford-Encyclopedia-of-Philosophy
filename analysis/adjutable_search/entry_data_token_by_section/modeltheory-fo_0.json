    "main_text": "First-order languages and structures\n1. First-order languages and structures\n\n\nMathematical model theory carries a heavy load of notation, and HTML is\nnot the best container for it. In what follows, syntactic objects\n(languages, theories, sentences) are generally written in roman or\ngreek letters (for example L, T, \u03c6), and set-theoretic objects such\nas structures and their elements are written in italic (A,\na). Two exceptions are that variables are italic (x,\ny) and that sequences of elements are written with lower case\nroman letters (a, b). \n\n\nWe recall and refine some definitions from the entries on\n classical logic\n and\n model theory.\n A signature is a set\nof individual constants, predicate symbols and function symbols; each\nof the predicate symbols and function symbols has an arity\n(for example it is binary if its arity is 2). Each signature K gives\nrise to a first-order language, by building up formulas from the\nsymbols in the signature together with logical symbols (including =)\nand punctuation.\n\n\nIf K is a signature, then a structure of signature K, say\nA, consists of the following items:\n\nA set called the domain of A and written\ndom(A); it is usually assumed to be nonempty;\nfor each individual constant c in K, an element\ncA of dom(A);\nfor each predicate symbol P of arity n, an\nn-ary relation PA on dom(A);\nfor each function symbol F of arity n, an\nn-ary function FA from dom(A) to\ndom(A).\n\n\n\nThe elements of A are the elements of\ndom(A). Likewise the cardinality or power of\nA is the cardinality of its domain. Since we can recover the\nsignature K from the first-order language L that it generates, we can\nand will refer to structures of signature K as L-structures.\nWe think of c as a name for the element\ncA in the structure A, and\nlikewise with the other symbols.\n\n\nFor example the field of real numbers forms a structure\nR whose elements are the real numbers, with\nsignature consisting of the individual constant 0 to name the number\nzero, a 1-ary function symbol \u2212 for minus, and two 2-ary function\nsymbols + and . for plus and times. At first sight we can\u2019t add a\nsymbol to express 1/x, since all the named functions have to\nbe defined on the whole domain of the structure, and there is no such\nreal number as 1/0. But on second thoughts this is not a serious\nproblem; any competent mathematician puts the condition\n\u2018x is not zero\u2019 before dividing by x, and\nso it never matters what the value of 1/0 is, and we can harmlessly\ntake it to be 42. But most model theorists are uncomfortable with any\nkind of division by zero, so they stick with plus, times and minus.\n\n\nIf L is the first-order language of signature K, then\n Tarski\u2019s model-theoretic truth\ndefinition tells us when a sentence of L is true in A,\nand when an assignment of elements of A to variables\nsatisfies a formula of L in A. Instead of talking of\nassignments satisfying a formula, model theorists often speak of the\nset of n-tuples of elements of A that\nis defined by a formula\n\u03c6(v1,\u2026,vn);\nthe connection is that an n-tuple\n(a1,\u2026,an) is\nin the defined set if and only if the assignment taking each\nvi to ai\nsatisfies the formula.\n\n\nIf \u03c6 is a sentence, we write\nA\n \u22a8\n\u03c6\n\n\nto mean that \u03c6 is true in A, or in other words, A\nis a model of \u03c6. If\n\u03c6(v1,\u2026,vn)\nis a formula with free variables as shown, we write \nA\n \u22a8\n\u03c6[a]\n\n\nto mean that the n-tuple a is in the set defined by \u03c6.\n(The entry on\n classical logic\n uses\nthe notation \u2018A,s\n \u22a8\n\u03c6\u2019,\n where s is any assignment to all the variables\nof L that assigns to each variable vi free\nin \u03c6 the i-th element in the n-tuple a.) \n\n\nTwo L-structures that are models of exactly the same sentences of L\nare said to be elementarily equivalent. Elementary equivalence\nis an equivalence relation on the class of all L-structures. The set of\nall the sentences of L that are true in the L-structure A is\ncalled the complete theory of A, in symbols\nTh(A). A theory that is Th(A) for some structure\nA is said to be complete. (By the completeness\ntheorem for first-order logic, for which see the entry on\n classical logic,\n a theory is complete if\nand only if it is maximal syntactically consistent.) The two structures\nA and B are elementarily equivalent if and only if\nTh(A) = Th(B).\n\n\nTo continue the example of the field R of\nreal numbers: It is often not at all obvious whether two given\nstructures are or are not elementarily equivalent. One of the greatest\nachievements of the pre-history of model theory was Tarski\u2019s\ndescription in 1930 of Th(R) (which he\npublished in full only after the war; see his book in the Bibliography\nbelow). This description implied among other things that the structures\nelementarily equivalent to R are exactly the\nreal-closed fields, a class of fields which was already known to the\nalgebraists in its own right.\n\n\nWhen mathematicians introduce a class of structures, they like to\ndefine what they count as the basic maps between these structures. The\nbasic maps between structures of the same signature K are called\nhomomorphisms, defined as follows. A homomorphism from\nstructure A to structure B is a function f from\ndom(A) to dom(B) with the property that for every\natomic formula\n\u03c6(v1,\u2026,vn)\nand any n-tuple a =\n(a1,\u2026,an) of\nelements of A,\nA\n \u22a8\n \u03c6 [a]\n\u21d2 B\n \u22a8\n \u03c6\n[b]\n\n where b is\n(f(a1),\u2026,f(an)). \nIf we have \u2018\u21d4\u2019 in place of\n\u2018\u21d2\u2019 in the quoted condition, we say that f is\nan embedding of A into B. Since the language\nincludes =, an embedding of A into B is always\none-to-one, though it need not be onto the domain of B. If it\nis onto, then the inverse map from dom(B) to dom(A)\nis also a homomorphism, and both the embedding and its inverse are said\nto be isomorphisms. We say that two structures are\nisomorphic if there is an isomorphism from one to the other.\nIsomorphism is an equivalence relation on the class of all structures\nof a fixed signature K. If two structures are isomorphic then they\nshare all model-theoretic properties; in particular they are\nelementarily equivalent. \n\n\nIf A and B are structures of signature K with\ndom(A) a subset of dom(B), and the interpretations in\nA of the symbols in K are just the restrictions of their\ninterpretations in B, then we say that A is a\nsubstructure of B and conversely B is an\nextension of A. If moreover B has some\nelements that are not in A, we say that A is a\nproper substructure of B and B is an\nproper extension of A. If B is a structure\nand X is a nonempty subset of dom(B), then there is a\nunique smallest substructure of B whose domain contains all of\nX. It is known as the substructure of B generated by\nX, and we find it by first adding to X all the\nelements cB where c are individual\nconstants of K, and then closing off under the functions\nFB where F are function symbols of K.\n\n\nFor example the substructure of the field\nR generated by the number 1 consists of 1, 0\n(since it is named by the constant 0), 1+1, 1+1+1 etc., \u22121,\n\u22122 etc., in other words the ring of integers. (There is no need\nto close off under multiplication too, since the set of integers is\nalready closed under multiplication.) If we had included a symbol for\n1/x too, the substructure generated by 1 would have been the\nfield of rational numbers. So the notion of substructure is sensitive\nto the choice of signature.\n",
