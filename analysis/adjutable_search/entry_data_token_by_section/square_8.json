    "main_text": "The Principles of Contraposition and Obversion\n4. The Principles of Contraposition and Obversion\n\n\nOne other piece of subject-matter bears on the interpretation of the O\nform. People were interested in Aristotle\u2019s discussion of \u201cinfinite\u201d\n negation,[9]\n which is the use of negation to form a term from a term instead of a\nproposition from a proposition. In modern English we use \u201cnon\u201d for\nthis; we make \u201cnon-horse,\u201d which is true of exactly those things that\nare not horses. In medieval Latin \u201cnon\u201d and \u201cnot\u201d are the same word,\nand so the distinction required special discussion.  It became common\nto use infinite negation, and logicians pondered its logic. Some\nwriters in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries adopted a principle\ncalled \u201cconversion by contraposition.\u201d It states that\n\n\u2018Every S is P\u2019 is equivalent to\n\u2018Every non-P is non-S\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Some S is not P\u2019 is equivalent to\n\u2018Some non-P is not non-S\u2019\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this principle (which is not endorsed by\n Aristotle[10])\n conflicts with the idea that there may be empty or universal\nterms. For in the universal case it leads directly from the truth:\nEvery man is a being\n\n\nto the falsehood: \nEvery non-being is a non-man\n\n\n(which is false because the universal affirmative has existential\nimport, and there are no non-beings). And in the particular case it\nleads from the truth (remember that the O form has no\nexistential import):\nA chimera is not a man\n\n\nto the falsehood: \nA non-man is not a non-chimera\n\n\nThese are Buridan\u2019s examples, used in the fourteenth century to show\nthe invalidity of contraposition. Unfortunately, by Buridan\u2019s time the\nprinciple of contraposition had been advocated by a number of authors.\nThe doctrine is already present in several twelfth century\n tracts,[11]\n and it is endorsed in the thirteenth\ncentury by Peter of\n Spain,[12]\n whose work was republished for centuries,\nby William\n Sherwood,[13]\nand by Roger Bacon.[14]\n By the fourteenth century, problems\nassociated with contraposition seem to be well-known, and authors\ngenerally cite the principle and note that it is not valid, but that it\nbecomes valid with an additional assumption of existence of things\nfalling under the subject term. For example, Paul of Venice in his\neclectic and widely published Logica Parva from the end of the\nfourteenth century gives the traditional square with simple\n conversion[15]\n but rejects conversion by contraposition,\nessentially for Buridan\u2019s reason. \n\n\nA similar thing happened with the principle of obversion. This is\nthe principle that states that you can change a proposition from\naffirmative to negative, or vice versa, if you change the predicate\nterm from finite to infinite (or infinite to finite). Some examples\nare:\n\n\n\nEvery S is P\n=\nNo S is non-P\n\n\nNo S is P\n=\nEvery S is non-P\n\n\nSome S is P\n=\nSome S is not non-P\n\n\nSome S is not P\n=\nSome S is non-P\n\n\n\n\n\nAristotle discussed some instances of obversion in De\nInterpretatione. It is apparent, given the truth conditions for\nthe forms, that these inferences are valid when moving from affirmative\nto negative, but not in the reverse direction when the terms may be\nempty, as Buridan makes\n clear.[16]\n Some medieval writers\nbefore Buridan accepted the fallacious versions, and some did\n not.[17]\n",
