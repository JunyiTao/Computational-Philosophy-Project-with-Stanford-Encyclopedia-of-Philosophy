    "main_text": "Moral motivation 1: reward and punishment\n3. Moral motivation 1: reward and punishment\n\nLocke\u2019s hedonism has a dual function in Locke\u2019s moral theory. It\naccounts both for how we acquire the ideas of moral good and evil that\nlie at the root of moral law and for the motivation to comply\nwith moral rules. A prominent feature of Locke\u2019s moral legalism is his\nview that a law needs to carry the threat of sanctions for it to have\nnormative force. Locke holds this view on the basis of his hedonistic\ntheory of human motivation.\n",
