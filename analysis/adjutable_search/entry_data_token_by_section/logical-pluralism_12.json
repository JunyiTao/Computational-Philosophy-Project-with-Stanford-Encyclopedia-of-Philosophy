    "main_text": "Logical Pluralism via Linguistic Pluralism || Issues for Carnap\u2019s Pluralism\n4.2 Issues for Carnap\u2019s Pluralism\n\nA number of contemporary writers have been happy to endorse\nCarnap\u2019s approach to pluralism (see, e.g., Varzi 2002: 199), and\nRestall argues that it is less radical than his and JC Beall\u2019s\ncase-based version (Restall 2002). Nonetheless there are several\nissues that someone who wanted to defend Carnap\u2019s position today\nwould need to address. A first concern about the view is that while we\nare working within the various languages we invent, we could be\nmissing the \u201ccorrect\u201d rules\u2014the ones that were out\nthere, in effect, before we invented anything. In the words of Paul\nBoghossian,\n\n\nAre we really to suppose that, prior to our stipulating a meaning for\nthe sentence \u201cEither snow is white or it isn\u2019t\u201d\nit wasn\u2019t the case that either snow was white or it\nwasn\u2019t? Isn\u2019t it overwhelmingly obvious that this\nclaim was true before such an act of meaning, and that it\nwould have been true even if no one had thought about it, or chosen it\nto be expressed by one of our sentences? (Boghossian 1996: 365,\nemphasis in original)\n\n\nCarnap would perhaps not have taken this objection seriously, since,\nlike the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus (e.g.,\n\u00a7\u00a74.26, 4.461\u20134.465), he does not believe that logical\ntruths and rules are \u201cout there\u201d, waiting to be\ndiscovered:\n\n\nThe so-called \u201creal\u201d sentences, constitute the core of the\nscience; the mathematico-logical sentences are analytic, with no real\ncontent, and are merely formal auxiliaries. (Carnap 1937: xiv)\n\n\nNonetheless, such a \u201cconventionalist\u201d view of logical\ntruth (and along with it, analytic truth) has been argued against by,\nfor example, Quine, Yablo, Boghossian, and Sober, and it no longer\nenjoys the popularity that it had in Carnap\u2019s time (Quine 1936;\nYablo 1992; Boghossian 1996; Sober 2000). It also highlights the\nextent to which it is odd to call Carnap a logical pluralist, since in\na way his view is not that there is more than one correct logic, but\nthat there is nothing for logic to be correct about (Cook 2010: 498).\nPerhaps it would be more illuminating to call Carnap a logical\nconstructivist.\n\nAnother issue is whether Carnap\u2019s conception of meaning is\ncorrect. These days there are many alternative approaches to meaning\nand lively debate about them. Field writes:\n\n\nOn some readings of \u201cdiffer in meaning\u201d, any big\ndifference in theory generates a difference in meaning. On such\nreadings, the connectives do indeed differ in meaning between\nadvocates of the different all-purpose logics, just as\n\u201celectron\u201d differs in meaning between Thomson\u2019s\ntheory and Rutherford\u2019s; but Rutherford\u2019s theory disagrees\nwith Thomson\u2019s despite this difference in meaning, and it is\nunclear why we shouldn\u2019t say the same thing about alternative\nall-purpose logics. (Field 2009: 345)\n\n\nField concludes that \u201cthe notion of difference of meaning is\nunhelpful in the context\u201d and that Carnap\u2019s view of the\nmeanings of the logical contexts is therefore hard to defend.\n\nBut proponents of particular alternative views about the meanings of\nthe logical constants might instead hold that they can make good sense\nof difference in meaning in these contexts, and that Carnap has simply\nendorsed the wrong theory of meaning and as a result drawn the wrong\nconclusions for logic. One specific issue that they might point to is\nassociated with Prior\u2019s 1960 paper \u201cThe Runabout Inference\nTicket\u201d, in which he provides rules for a new connective,\ntonk. The connective quickly leads to triviality, suggesting\nthat Prior was not quite \u201cat liberty to build his own\nlogic\u201d by introducing rules for his expressions.\n\nAnother issue is the fact that one can generate different logics, not\nby varying the rules governing any particular expression, but rather\nby varying the more general structural rules of the logic, which\ngovern things like whether or not one is allowed multiple conclusions,\nand whether or not a premise can be used more than once in a proof\n(Restall 2000; Paoli 2003). This suggests that even if the meanings of\nthe logical expressions are governed by the rules that tell you how\nthey can be used in proofs (as Carnap suggests) two logics can agree\non those rules, whilst disagreeing on the relation of logical\nconsequence. Hence even if you have successfully chosen a language, it\nseems that you might not yet have determined a logic.\n",
