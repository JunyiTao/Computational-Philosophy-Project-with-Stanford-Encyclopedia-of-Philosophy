    "main_text": "The Essence of Constructive and Intuitionistic Set Theory || Constructive versus intuitionistic set theory\n1.2 Constructive versus intuitionistic set theory\n\n\nAlthough there are many systems of sets based on\nintuitionistic logic, we can distinguish two main trends within the\nliterature. According to the first one, we take all of what is\navailable in classical ZF set theory and only modify those principles,\nsuch as foundation, which have a clear incompatibility with\nintuitionistic logic. This gives rise to set theories such as\nIntuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel,\n IZF,\na variant of which was introduced as early as in (Friedman\n1973a). (See Beeson 1985, Chapters 8 and 9 and Scedrov 1985 for two\nsurveys on IZF.) The rationale behind these theories appears to be\nthat of granting the mathematician the most powerful tools possible,\nas long as compatibility with intuitionistic logic is\npreserved. According to the second approach, in addition to the\nadherence to intuitionistic logic we also introduce restrictions on\nthe set-theoretic principles admitted, as far as the resulting system\ncomplies with the constructive mathematical practice. Theories of\nthis second kind can thus be seen as the outcome of a double process\nof restriction with respect to classical ZF. First there is a\nrestriction to intuitionistic logic, then a restriction is imposed on\nthe set-theoretic constructions allowed. The latter is motivated by\n(1) the observation that weaker principles appear to suffice for the\nconstructive mathematical practice and (2) the desire to adhere to a\nform of predicativity (see the next section for a clarification of\nthis notion of predicativity). Paradigmatic examples of the latter\nkind of systems are Myhill\u2019s Constructive Set Theory (Myhill 1975),\nFriedman\u2019s system B (Friedman 1977) and Aczel\u2019s Constructive\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory\n CZF\n (Aczel 1978; 1982; 1986, Aczel & Rathjen\n2001; Aczel & Rathjen 2010, Other Internet Resources). We can also say that in this second approach the foundational\nmotivation influences the practice to a higher degree.\n\n\nIn the following we make use of a convention which is often in\nplace today, according to which the adjective\n\u201cintuitionistic\u201d refers to those set theories, such as\nIZF, which are impredicative, while \u201cconstructive\u201d refers\nto set theories, such as CZF, which comply with a form of\npredicativity. Note, however, that this convention is\nnot always followed in the literature. In fact, the adjective\n\u201cconstructive\u201d has also been used to denote impredicative\ntheories, and \u201cintuitionistic\u201d to refer to predicative\nfoundational theories such as Martin-L\u00f6f type theory\n(Martin-L\u00f6f 1975; 1984). It is also worth noting that the present\nconvention on the use of the words \u201cconstructive\u201d and\n\u201cintuitionistic\u201d differs from that made in the context of\nconstructive mathematics (see, for example, the entry\non constructive mathematics\nand also Bridges and Richman 1987).\n",
