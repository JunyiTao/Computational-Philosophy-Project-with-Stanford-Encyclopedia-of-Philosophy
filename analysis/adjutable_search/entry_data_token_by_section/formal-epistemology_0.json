In the early 20th\ncentury, large swaths of mathematics were successfully reconstructed\nusing first-order logic. Many philosophers sought a similar\nsystematization of the reasoning in empirical sciences, like biology,\npsychology, and physics. Though empirical sciences rely heavily on\nnon-deductive reasoning, the tools of deductive logic still offer a\npromising starting point.\n",
