    "main_text": "The Politics of Beauty || Aristocracy and Capital\n3.1 Aristocracy and Capital\n\nThe French revolutionaries of 1789 associated beauty with the French\naristocracy and with the Rococo style of the French royal family, as in\nthe paintings of Fragonard: hedonist expressions of wealth and\ndecadence, every inch filled with decorative motifs. Beauty itself\nbecame subject to a moral and political critique, or even to direct\ndestruction, with political motivations (see Levey 1985). And by the early\n20th century, beauty was particularly associated with capitalism\n(ironically enough, considering the ugliness of the poverty and\nenvironmental destruction it often induced). At times even great art\nappeared to be dedicated mainly to furnishing the homes of rich\npeople, with the effect of concealing the suffering they were\ninflicting. In response, many anti-capitalists, including many\nMarxists, appeared to repudiate beauty entirely. And in the aesthetic\npolitics of Nazism, reflected for example in the films of Leni\nRiefenstahl, the association of beauty and right wing politics was\nsealed to devastating effect (see Spotts 2003).\n\nEarly on in his authorship, Karl Marx could hint that the experience\nof beauty distinguishes human beings from all other animals. An animal\n\u201cproduces only under the dominion of immediate physical need,\nwhilst man produces even when he is free from physical need and only\ntruly produces in freedom therefrom. Man therefore also forms objects\nin accordance with the laws of beauty\u201d (Marx 1844, 76). But later\nMarx appeared to conceive beauty as \u201csuperstructure\u201d or\n\u201cideology\u201d disguising the material conditions of\nproduction. Perhaps, however, he also anticipated the emergence of new\nbeauties, available to all both as makers and appreciators, in\nsocialism.\n\nCapitalism, of course, uses beauty \u2013 at times with complete\nself-consciousness \u2013 to manipulate people into buying things.\nMany Marxists believed that the arts must be turned from providing\nfripperies to the privileged or advertising that helps make them\nwealthier to showing the dark realities of capitalism (as in the\nAmerican Ashcan school, for example), and articulating an inspiring\nCommunist future. Stalinist socialist realism consciously repudiates\nthe aestheticized beauties of post-impressionist and abstract\npainting, for example. It has urgent social tasks to perform (see Bown\nand Lanfranconi 2012). But the critique tended at times to generalize to\nall sorts of beauty: as luxury, as seduction, as disguise and\noppression. The artist Max Ernst (1891\u20131976), having survived\nthe First World War, wrote this about the radical artists of the early\ncentury: \u201cTo us, Dada was above all a moral reaction. Our rage\naimed at total subversion. A horrible futile war had robbed us of five\nyears of our existence. We had experienced the collapse into ridicule\nand shame of everything represented to us as just, true, and\nbeautiful. My works of that period were not meant to attract, but to\nmake people scream\u201d (quoted in Danto 2003, 49).\n\nTheodor Adorno, in his book Aesthetic Theory, wrote that one\nsymptom of oppression is that oppressed groups and cultures are\nregarded as uncouth, dirty, ragged; in short, that poverty is ugly. It\nis art\u2019s obligation, he wrote, to show this ugliness, imposed on\npeople by an unjust system, clearly and without flinching, rather to\ndistract people by beauty from the brutal realities of\ncapitalism. \u201cArt must take up the cause of what is proscribed as\nugly, though no longer to integrate or mitigate it or reconcile it\nwith its own existence,\u201d Adorno wrote.  \u201cRather, in the\nugly, art must denounce the world that creates and reproduces the ugly\nin its own image\u201d (Adorno 1970, 48\u20139).\n\nThe political entanglements of beauty tend to throw into question\nvarious of the traditional theories. For example, the purity and\ntranscendence associated with the essence of beauty in the realm of\nthe Forms seems irrelevant, as beauty shows its centrality to politics\nand commerce, to concrete dimensions of oppression. The austere\nformalism of the classical conception, for example, seems neither here\nnor there when the building process is brutally exploitative.\n",
