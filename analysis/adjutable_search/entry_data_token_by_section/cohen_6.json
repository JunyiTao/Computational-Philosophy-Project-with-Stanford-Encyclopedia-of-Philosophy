The Kantian Foundations of Democratic Socialism, Aesthetics\n\nHowever, while a doctrine of pure, universal laws makes possible a\ncoherent theory of the concept of humanity, Cohen thinks the laws of\nany actual state will fall short of pure law\u2019s ideal form. He\nmaintains that states, in the course of their development through\nhistory, tend to amend their laws so as to better approximate the\nideal laws. Cohen does not argue from some antecedent philosophical\ntheory of human nature that history is somehow compelled to exhibit\nthis progress (Cohen 1902, 37). Rather, he simply accepts it as a\ndatum of history: philosophy can no more deny this progress than it\ncan deny progress in the history of physics and mathematics. At the\nsame time, Cohen\u2019s optimism was tempered by an awareness of\ninjustice in the non-ideal world: moral progress must be unending,\nprecisely because no actual state will ever realize the ideal\ncompletely (Schwarzschild 1979, 139\u201340). During the World War,\nCohen even came to believe that certain forms of nationalism might be\nineliminable engines of humanity\u2019s historical progress towards a\ncosmopolitan confederation of ideal states. (See Vatter 2017 for\ndiscussion of the tension between Cohen\u2019s liberal\ncosmopolitanism and his wartime nationalism.) There is, in\nCohen\u2019s terms, an unbridgeable gap between Being and the\nOught.\n\nAs Cohen saw it, political progress was, and ought to be, moving\ntowards democratic socialism. The laws of an undemocratic state cannot\ngenuinely reconcile the wills of individuals and pluralities of\nindividuals, even if the state has the power to control their\nbehavior. So, Cohen argued in his 1904 essay \u201cThe General,\nEqual, and Direct Right Vote,\u201d any state whose laws make the\nwills of individuals and pluralities cohere must be one with universal\nsuffrage (van der Linden 1988, 215). He thus opposed Wilhelmine\nGermany\u2019s system of tiered suffrage, under which lower-class men\nfrom some regions voted only in national elections and women did not\nvote at all.\n\nMoreover, Cohen argued that, as states amend their laws to better\napproximate ideal laws, legal frameworks should emerge to govern the\neconomic activity of democratically-constituted pluralities of people.\nIn other words, he thought that an ideal state would allow democratic\nworkers\u2019 collectives to own the means of production. In his\nEthics of Pure Will as well as his 1896\n\u201cPostscript\u201d to F.A. Lange\u2019s History of\nMaterialism, Cohen argues that this socialism follows\nstraightforwardly from a proper understanding of Kant\u2019s\ncategorical imperative (Cohen 1902, 320). For Cohen, not treating\npeople merely as a means entails not exploiting their labor (Holzhey\n2005, 26). Along with Lange, Cohen thus advocated a socialism with\nKantian and liberal foundations, rather than Marxist ones. (The 1890\nrepeal of Bismark\u2019s Anti-Socialist Laws would have offered him\nsome evidence that Germany was moving towards that democratic\nsocialist ideal.) Cohen\u2019s Kantian socialism was an important\ninfluence on socialist political leaders such as Eduard Bernstein, a\nsocial democratic member of the Reichstag (Gay 1970).\n\nPolitics was not the only sphere in which Cohen thought philosophy\nmust engage with culture. In the third part of his System of\nPhilosophy, the Aesthetics of Pure Feeling (1912), he\nargued that critical philosophy could not leave art without a\nphilosophical foundation (Cohen 1982 [1912], 1.4). In his aesthetics,\nCohen sought to avoid Schelling and Hegel\u2019s view that art is an\nexpression of ideas that can be distilled from it and expressed in\npurely conceptual terms. Likewise, Cohen rejected Helmholtz\u2019s\nphysiological approach to aesthetics, exemplified by his physiological\nand experimental investigation of tone-perception in music. However,\nin Cohen\u2019s theory of knowledge and ethics, he had avoided these\napproaches by adhering to the transcendental method\u2014that is, by\nstarting with a \u201cfact\u201d of (natural or juridical) science\nand then articulating the a priori, universal laws that constitute\nthat science\u2019s object. But for Cohen, there is no \u201cscience\nof art.\u201d Thus for Cohen, a philosophical aesthetics must begin\nwith only the \u201cfact\u201d that art is central to culture (Poma\n1997, Ch. 7; Guyer 2008).\n\nFrom this starting point, Cohen develops an account of \u201cpure\nfeeling.\u201d Pure feeling cannot be the consciousness of the\nobjects of natural science or the moral consciousness of ethical\nideals. But these two domains of objects \u2013 the world as it is\nand the world as it ought to be \u2013 are the only possible objects\nwe can be conscious of. Thus, Cohen argues, pure feeling must be the\nconsciousness that we are conscious. That is, it is our basic\nlevel of consciousness of the fact that we can be conscious of both\nthe objects of natural science and of ethical ideals (Guyer 2008).\nFurther, Cohen characterizes that basic level of consciousness as\n\u201clawfulness\u201d (Gesetzlichkeit) (Cohen 1982 [1912],\n1.68ff; cf. de Launay 2005). According to Cohen, this lawfulness of\npure feeling is what produces the object of aesthetic judgment.\n(Trochimska-Kubacka 2018 provides a useful survey of how Cohen\u2019s\nmature aesthetics differs from Kant\u2019s.)\n\nApart from systematic philosophical considerations, Cohen\u2019s\naesthetics is of interest for the light it promises to shed on his\nphilosophy of religion. Cohen came to believe that concepts central to\nphilosophy of religion should be articulated by interpreting\nhistorical scriptural texts, including prayers and biblical poetry and\nprose (Kepnes 2007, Ch. 2) (see \u00a79 below). Thus recent\ncommentators have used Cohen\u2019s account of lyric poetry in the\nAesthetics of Pure Feeling to help make sense of his account\nof an individual\u2019s love for God (Poma 2000), as well as his\nconception of compassion (Wiedebach 2002).\n",
