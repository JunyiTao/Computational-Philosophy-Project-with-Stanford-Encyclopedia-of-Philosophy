    "main_text": "Newtonian Spacetime || McTaggart\u2019s Argument\n2.2 McTaggart\u2019s Argument\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, J. M. E. McTaggart (1908)\npresented an argument which purported to prove that time is unreal.\nAccording to McTaggart (1927, pp. 9\u201310):\n\nPositions in time, as time appears to us prima facie, are\ndistinguished in two ways. Each position is Earlier than some and\nLater than some of the other positions\u2026 . In the second place,\neach position is either Past, Present, or Future. The distinctions of\nthe former class are permanent, while those of the latter are not. If\n\\(M\\) is ever earlier than \\(N\\), it is\nalways earlier, But an event, which is now present, was future, and\nwill be past.\n\n\nThe first structure of \u201cpositions in time,\u201d McTaggart\ncalled the B-series. I will assume that McTaggart intended\nthe B-series to coincide with the Newtonian spacetime structure\ndescribed above. McTaggart noted that there was something static or\n\u201cpermanent\u201d about the B-series. If, for example, event\n\\(e_1\\) is earlier than event \\(e_2\\) at some time or other, then one\nmay truly assert at all times that \\(e_1\\) is earlier than \\(e_2\\)\n.\n\nThe dynamic element of time must be represented, in McTaggart\u2019s\nview, by the series of properties of pastness, presentness, and\nfuturity, which (in contrast to the static B-series) are constantly\nchanging. A given event becomes less future, becomes present, and then\nbecomes increasingly past. This latter ever-shifting series McTaggart\ncalled the A-series.\n\nWhile there are many obscurities in McTaggart\u2019s writing, it\nseems clear that his argument that time is unreal runs along the\nfollowing lines:\n\n(1)\n there can be no time unless it has a dynamic element (that is, on\nhis view, unless there is an A-series),\n(2)\n there can be no A-series, because the supposition that there is an\nA-series leads to contradiction.\n\n\nThe contradiction alleged by McTaggart is that:\n\n(A1)\n every event must have many, if not all, the A-properties (or\nA-determinations, as they are sometimes called) whereas,\n(A2)\n since the A-properties are mutually exclusive, no event can have\nmore than one of them.\n\n\nNear the end of a career in which he spent much time and effort in\nthinking about McTaggart\u2019s argument, C. D. Broad (1959, p. 765)\nwrote:\n\nI felt from the first, and still feel, that the difficulty which\narises is (a) embarrassing enough prima facie to demand the serious\nattention of anyone who philosophises about time, and (b) almost\ncertainly due to some purely linguistic source (common, and perhaps\npeculiar, to the Indo-European verb-system), which it ought to be\npossible to indicate and make harmless.\n\n\nBroad\u2019s claim (a) was vindicated by the fact that\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument has received serious attention from most\nsubsequent philosophers who pondered the metaphysics of time. Much of\nthis debate concerns the relative relations of the two series. Is the\nA-series fundamental and the B-series derived from it, or vice versa;\nor does, perhaps, one series supervene upon the other? In the formal\nmode, the questions become whether the B-series may somehow be reduced\nto, may be defined in terms of, the A-series (or vice versa). These\ndebates concern mainly language rather than physics and will not be\nconsidered\n here.[2]\n\nWhat emerges from the McTaggart literature is, first of all, a\ntendency to identify the existence of passage or temporal becoming\nwith the existence of the A-series (that is, to think of becoming as\nevents changing their properties of pastness, presentness or nowness,\nand futurity) and hence the tendency for debates about the existence\nof passage to focus on the merits or incoherence of the A-series\nrather than examining alternative accounts of becoming. (But Cf.\nFitzgerald, 1985)\n\nThere is a contrary tendency amongst those philosophers who take\nmodern physics seriously to be sceptical of entities like constantly\nshifting temporal properties of events, since such properties play no\nrole in modern physical theory. One view, defended by Paul Horwich\n(1987, Chapter 2) and Huw Mellor (1981, 1998), is that even though\nMcTaggart showed that the A-series is impossible, the B-series (that\nis, static classical spacetime structure) suffices for time.\n\nBefore we expand on this theme, though, first a few words about\nBroad\u2019s (b), his suspicion that there is some peculiarity of our\nlanguage(s) that creates or at least reinforces the credibility of\nMcTaggart\u2019s anti-passage argument. Broad suspected that there\nwas a subtle ambiguity in the copula \u2018is\u2019 between tensed\nand tenseless uses, between the uses in, for instance:\n\nIt is raining\n\nand\n\nSeven is prime,\n\nthe former sentence containing a tensed and the latter sentence a\nnon-tensed or tenseless copula. It has been further suggested (Sellars\n1962) that one might understand a non-tensed copula (indicated by\n\u2018be\u2019 rather than \u2018is\u2019) after the following\nfashion\n\n\\(S\\) be \\(F\\) at \\(t\\)\niff \\((S\\) was \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) or \\(S\\)\nis \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) or\n\\(S\\) will be \\(F\\) at \\(t)\\),\n\nwhere the verbs to the right of the \u2018iff\u2019 (a\nlogician\u2019s abbreviation for \u2018if and only if\u2019) are\nusual tensed verbs.\n\nAlternatively, one might think of a tenseless copula as the usual\ncopula stripped of temporal information (Quine, 1960, p. 170, Mellor\n1981, 1998, Chapter 7), just as the usual copula carries no spatial\ninformation. If we indicate this tenseless copula by writing\n\u2018BE\u2019 instead of \u2018is,\u2019 we can say that\n\u2018It BE windy in Chicago\u2019 carries information about the\nplace but not the time of the wind, just as \u2018It BE windy at\nt\u2019 tells us about its time but not its place.\n\nThese distinctions will prove helpful in the subsequent discussion of\nbecoming in modern physics. For the moment, one might note that Broad\ncould argue that McTaggart\u2019s (A1) seems plausible if\nthe copula is understood in some tenseless fashion, whereas\n(A2) is plausible if the copula is tensed. If, however, the\ncopula is not univocal in (A1) and (A2), then\nthere is no contradiction involved in accepting both (Savitt,\n2001).\n\nThe claim that the copula is ambiguous (or more precisely, polysemous)\nhas also been thought to have some implications for the metaphysical\ndispute between presentism and the two non-presentist views sketched\nabove. A number of authors (Meyer (2005), Savitt (2006), Dorato\n(2006), Lombard (2010), and Arthur (2019, section 2.3). See Dolev\n(2007) for a different anti-ontological argument.) have argued that in\norder for there to be a genuine difference between these allegedly\ndistinct metaphysical views, in addition to the suggestive pictures\ndisplayed above there must be some univocal statement or proposition\nconcerning temporal ontology that one side asserts and the other side\ndenies. When the polysemy of the copula (or of the verb \u2018to\nexist\u2019) is taken into account, it has proven very difficult to\nfind a clear example of such a statement or proposition. What many\nphilosophers take to be a profound dispute in the metaphysics of time\nmay well turn out to be a mere verbal tangle. (Putnam (2008), by the\nway, has recently joined these critics: \u201c[T]he question whether\nthe past and future are \u2018real\u2019 is a\npseudo-question.\u201d)\n\nAccording to one author (Sider, 2006), there seems to be disagreement\nconcerning the following assertion: dinosaurs exist. Presentists are\nunderstood to deny this claim, while eternalists are supposed to\naffirm it. If those who endorse the claim understand the verb\n\u2018exist\u2019 to be tenseless and those who deny it take\n\u2018exist\u2019 to be a present tense verb, then both sides seem\nto endorse correct claims. There is in this instance, however, no\nunivocal statement that is being disputed, since \u2018exist\u2019\nis understood differently by the two sides. This observation has led\nmany to try to state a version of presentism that is neither trivial\nnor obviously false and to locate precisely the point at which it\ndiffers from non-presentist views. (See Crisp (2004a,b), Ludlow\n(2005), W\u00fcthrich (2012), Golosz (2013). Tallant (2013) reviews\nseveral such efforts negatively and adds one of his own.)\n\nThe few authors that have approached this debate from a linguistic\nperspective differ on the behaviour of the verb \u2018exist\u2019.\nLudlow (2005) considers both a tensed and a tenseless verb; Stoneham\n(2009) is sceptical with regard to tenseless predication; and Moltmann\n(2013) considers \u2018exist\u2019 only as a present tense verb. It\nis worth noting that he claims that \u2018exist\u2019 functions\nquite differently from \u2018there are\u2019 in that the latter can\nbe used to quantify over past, merely possible, and intensional\nentities whereas the former can not. If his claim is correct, then a\ncommon test sentence for the difference between eternalists and\npresentists introduced in Sider (2006)--There exist dinosaurs--seems\nalmost purpose-built to breed confusion.\n",
