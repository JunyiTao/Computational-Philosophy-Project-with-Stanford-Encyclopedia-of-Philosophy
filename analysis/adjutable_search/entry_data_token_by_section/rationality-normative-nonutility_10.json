    "main_text": "Imprecise Probabilities or Ambiguity || Normative Questions\n4.4 Normative Questions\n\nFor those who favor non-sharp probabilities, two sets of normative\nquestions arise. The first set is epistemic: whether it is epistemically rational not\nto have sharp probabilities (White 2009; Elga 2010; Joyce 2011;\nH\u00e1jek & Smithson 2012; Seidenfeld et al. 2012; Mayo-Wilson\n& Wheeler 2016; Schoenfield 2017; Vallinder 2018; Builes et al 2022; Konek\nms. \u2013 see Other Internet Resources).\n\nThe second set of questions question is practical. Some hold that ambiguity aversion is not well-motivated by practical reasons and so we have no reason to account for it (Schoenfield 2020). Others hold that some particular decision rule associated with non-sharp probabilities leads to bad consequences, e.g., in virtue of running afoul of the principles mentioned in\n section 1.2.3. Of particular interest is how\nthese decision rules can be extended to sequential choice (Seidenfeld\n1988a,b; Seidenfeld et al. 1990;\nElga 2010; Bradley and Steele 2014; Chandler 2014; Moss 2015; Sud 2014; Rinard 2015).\n",
