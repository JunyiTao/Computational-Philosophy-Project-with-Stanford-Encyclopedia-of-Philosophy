The editorial\nplan of the Book on the Science of Metaphysics follows the\nordering of the metaphysical and divine science according to\nal-Farabi\u2019s Enumeration of the Sciences. It consists in\nfact of three distinct parts which reflect al-Farabi\u2019s\ntripartite division: in the first part, which includes the first four\nchapters, there is the study of beings and their accidents; the second\npart, which goes from chapter five to chapter twelve, deals with the\nprinciples of definition and demonstration; the third and last part,\ncomprising chapters thirteen to twenty-four, is devoted to a\ndescription of the hierarchy of the immaterial and intelligible\nrealities until it reaches the First Mover, the First Principle, the\nFirst Cause, the One, which is nothing but the one God of the\nKoran, the provident Creator, in a synthesis of Aristotelian\nmetaphysics, Neoplatonic metaphysics, and Islamic monotheism (Neuwirth\n1976).\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif devotes a full sixteen out of twenty-four chapters\nto a discussion of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, which he\nprobably knew in more than one translation. The books of the\nMetaphysics he freely paraphrases are, in order, Alpha\nElatton/Alpha Meizon, Beta, Delta,\nGamma, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta,\nTheta, Iota, and Lambda (Neuwirth 1976,\n1977\u201378; Martini Bonadeo 2001, 2010, 2013, 2018; Ajoun 2017).\nThree whole chapters (13\u201315) are devoted to the latter one.\n\u2018Abd al-Latif is strongly influenced by Themistius\u2019\nparaphrase (Brague 1999) in his reading of Lambda. The\npresentation of Lambda ends with an entire chapter (16)\ncontaining an epitome of Alexander Arabus\u2019s treatise On the\nprinciples of the Universe (Badawi 1947; Genequand 2001; Endress\n2002; Ajoun 2017). \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s use of the\nMetaphysics reflects that of its first Arabic interpreters,\nin particular al-Kindi, who centered on the contents of books\nAlpha Elatton, Epsilon, and Lambda and was\ntied to the criterion of the doctrinal unity of Greek metaphysics: the\nnatural theology of Lambda is only a premise for a\ncharacterization of the First Principle, which is of clear Neoplatonic\norigin (D\u2019Ancona 1996).\n\nThis is particularly clear from the very beginning of the Book on\nthe Science of Metaphysics. For \u2018Abd al-Latif, in fact,\nthere are different causes for different kinds of being and different\nsciences for different causes, but there is one first science leading\nall the others, for two different reasons. First, as al-Farabi taught,\nit is able to demonstrate the principles of the other sciences,\nbecause it is only this science, which investigates absolute beings\nand from them it provides an explanation of the principles of the\nparticular sciences, comprised in it and below it. Second, this\nscience includes speculation about the First Principle, which every\nother thing needs in its own existence. \u2018Abd al-Latif claims\nthat this First Principle is the absolute final cause and that the\nscience of this cause is the wisdom (hikma) which precedes\nall other knowledge (Martini Bonadeo 2010; 2017a).\n\nThe First Principle is described by \u2018Abd al-Latif in a typical\nAvicennian phrase as the Pure Being (al-wujud al-mujarrad),\nthe aim of everything, and the First mover immobile, pure act, eternal\nand everlasting, i.e., the First Principle whose knowledge is the end\nof our inquiry. The First mover not only produces the movement of the\nthings, but it is their perfection, namely the paradigmatic cause, and\ntheir final cause. Abd al-Latif introduces the example of the law,\nwhich he derives from Themistius\u2019 paraphrase (on Abd al-Latif\u2019s use of\nThemistius\u2019 Paraphrase of Book Lambda of\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics: Meyrav 2019). The law\nmoves politics in so far as it is chosen for itself. The First\nPrinciple, as God, is the cause for being of the worlds and their\nordering according to their beauty and their duration and it is a\nsubstance which equals his science. The First Principle is also\ndescribed as the True One (al-wahid al-haqq), one by essence,\nwithout any kind of multiplicity. The way to know this True One is to\nascend from the things which have some degree of unity. So we say one\narmy, one city, that Zayd is one, that the celestial sphere is one,\nand that the world is one. Then we proceed through souls and\nintellects, and through the things which in this ascent loose\nmultiplicity and acquire unity until we reach the Absolute One\n(al-wahid al-mutlaq), the architectural principle of\neverything and the supreme intelligible which makes the world be,\npreserves its existence, and orders it. The First Cause is for\n\u2018Abd al-Latif that cause which has within it all things in\npurely Neoplatonic vein. It is not surprising therefore that in\nparaphrasing chapter 10 of Lambda he speaks of emanation from\nthe First Principle.\n\nThe characteristics of the Neoplatonic One are thus grafted onto the\nAristotelian characterization of the First Principle. The point of\nfusion lies in the doctrine of the self-reflection of divine thought,\nwhich for \u2018Abd al-Latif, who is influenced by the exegesis of\nThemistius, is not a reason for composition and multiplicity within\nthe First Principle, as it was for Plotinus. If the thinking\nprinciple, the act of thinking and the object of thought coincide in\nthe First Principle, which by now is called God, there is in It no\nmultiplicity.\n",
