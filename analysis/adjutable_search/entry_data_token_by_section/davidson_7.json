    "main_text": "Meaning and Truth || Radical Interpretation\n3.3 Radical Interpretation\n\nDavidson\u2019s strategy is to embed the formal structure for a\ntheory of meaning (the structure he finds in a Tarskian truth theory)\nwithin a more general theory of interpretation the broad outlines of\nwhich he draws from Quine\u2019s discussion in Word and\nObject (first published in 1960). \u2018Radical\ntranslation\u2019 is intended by Quine as an idealisation of the\nproject of translation that will exhibit that project in its purest\nform. Normally the task of the translator is aided by prior linguistic\nknowledge \u2013 either of the actual language to be translated or of\nsome related language. Quine envisages a case in which translation of\na language must proceed without any prior linguistic knowledge and\nsolely on the basis of the observed behaviour of the speakers of the\nlanguage in conjunction with observation of the basic perceptual\nstimulations that give rise to that behaviour. Davidson has a broader\nconception of the behavioural evidence available than does Quine (he\nallows that we may, for instance, identify speakers as having the\nattitude of \u2018holding true\u2019 with respect to sentences) and,\nin addition, rejects the Quinean insistence on a special role being\ngiven to simple perceptual stimulations. Moreover, since\nDavidson\u2019s interest is more properly semantic than Quine\u2019s\n(Quine sees radical translation as part of a primarily epistemological\ninquiry), while Davidson also views a theory of translation alone as\ninsufficient to ensure understanding of the language it translates\n(the translation may be into a language we do not understand), so the\nnotion of \u2018translation\u2019 is replaced in the Davidsonian\naccount with that of \u2018interpretation\u2019. Radical\ninterpretation is a matter of interpreting the linguistic\nbehaviour of a speaker \u2018from scratch\u2019 and so without\nreliance on any prior knowledge either of the speaker\u2019s beliefs\nor the meanings of the speaker\u2019s utterances. It is intended to\nlay bare the knowledge that is required if linguistic understanding is\nto be possible, but it involves no claims about the possible\ninstantiation of that knowledge in the minds of interpreters (Davidson\nthus makes no commitments about the underlying psychological reality\nof the knowledge that a theory of interpretation makes explicit).\n\nThe basic problem that radical interpretation must address is that one\ncannot assign meanings to a speaker\u2019s utterances without knowing\nwhat the speaker believes, while one cannot identify beliefs without\nknowing what the speaker\u2019s utterances mean. It seems that we\nmust provide both a theory of belief and a theory of meaning at one\nand the same time. Davidson claims that the way to achieve this is\nthrough the application of the so-called \u2018principle of\ncharity\u2019 (he refers to it briefly elsewhere as the principle of\n\u2018rational accommodation\u2019), a version of which is also to\nbe found in Quine. In Davidson\u2019s work this principle, which\nadmits of various formulations and cannot be rendered in any\ncompletely precise form, often appears in terms of the injunction to\noptimise agreement between ourselves and those we interpret, that is,\nit counsels us to interpret speakers as holding true beliefs (true by\nour lights at least) wherever it is plausible to do (see\n\u2018Radical Interpretation\u2019 [1973]). In fact the principle\ncan be seen as combining two notions: a holistic assumption of\nrationality in belief (\u2018coherence\u2019) and an assumption of\ncausal relatedness between beliefs, especially perceptual beliefs, and\nthe objects of belief (\u2018correspondence\u2019) (see \u2018Three\nVarieties of Knowledge\u2019 [1991]). The process of interpretation\nturns out to depend on both aspects of the principle. Attributions of\nbelief and assignments of meaning must be consistent with one another\nand with the speaker\u2019s overall behaviour; they must also be\nconsistent with the evidence afforded by our knowledge of the\nspeaker\u2019s environment, since it is the worldly causes of beliefs\nthat must, in the \u2018most basic cases\u2019, be taken to be the\nobjects of belief (see \u2018A Coherence Theory of Truth and\nKnowledge\u2019 [1983]). Inasmuch as charity is taken to generate\nparticular attributions of belief, so those attributions are, of\ncourse, always defeasible. The principle itself is not so, however,\nsince it remains, on the Davidsonian account, a presupposition of any\ninterpretation whatsoever. Charity is, in this respect, both a\nconstraint and an enabling principle in all interpretation. It is more\nthan just a heuristic device to be employed in the opening stages of\ninterpretative engagement.\n\nIf we assume that the speaker\u2019s beliefs, at least in the\nsimplest and most basic cases, are largely in agreement with our own,\nand so, by our account, are largely true, then we can use our own\nbeliefs about the world as a guide to the speaker\u2019s beliefs.\nAnd, provided that we can identify simple assertoric utterances on the\npart of a speaker (that is, provided we can identify the attitude of\nholding true), then the interconnection between belief and meaning\nenables us to use our beliefs as a guide to the\nmeanings of the speaker\u2019s utterances, thereby providing\nthe basis for both a rudimentary theory of belief and a rudimentary\naccount of meaning. So, for example, when the speaker with whom we are\nengaged uses a certain sequence of sounds repeatedly in the presence\nof what we believe to be a rabbit, we can, as a preliminary\nhypothesis, interpret those sounds as utterances about rabbits or\nabout some particular rabbit. Once we have arrived at a preliminary\nassignment of meanings for a significant body of utterances, we can\ntest our assignments against further linguistic behaviour on the part\nof the speaker, modifying those assignments in accordance with the\nresults. Using our developing theory of meaning we are then able to\ntest the initial attributions of belief that were generated through\nthe application of charity, and, where necessary, modify those\nattributions also. This enables us, in turn, to further adjust our\nassignments of meaning, which enables further adjustment in the\nattribution of beliefs, \u2026 and so the process continues until\nsome sort of equilibrium is reached. The development of a more finely\ntuned theory of belief thus allows us to better adjust our theory of\nmeaning, while the adjustment of our theory of meaning in turn enables\nus to better tune our theory of belief. Through balancing attributions\nof belief against assignments of meaning, we are able to move towards\nan overall theory of behaviour for a speaker or speakers that combines\nboth a theory of meaning and of belief within a single theory of\ninterpretation.\n",
