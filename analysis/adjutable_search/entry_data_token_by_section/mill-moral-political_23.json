    "main_text": "Liberal Democracy || Representative Democracy\n4.1 Representative Democracy\n\nMill thinks that there are two ways in which democracy is, under the\nright circumstances, best suited to promote the common good.\n\nFirst, he thinks that democracy plays an important epistemic\nrole in identifying the common good. Proper deliberation about issues\naffecting the common good requires identifying the consequences\nof different policies for the interests of affected parties\nand so requires the proper representation and articulation of the\ninterests of citizens. But failure of imagination and the operation of\npersonal bias present obstacles to the effective representation of the\ninterests of others. Universal suffrage and political participation\nprovide the best assurance that the interests of the governed will be\nproperly appreciated by political decision-makers (404).\n\nSecond, Mill thinks that democracy is also the best form of government\nbecause of the constitutive effects of political\nparticipation on the improvement of the moral capacities of citizens\n(404). To the extent that the governed can and do participate in\npublic debate and elections they exercise those very deliberative\ncapacities that it is the aim of government to develop. They learn to\ngather information about their options, deliberate about their merits,\nand choose a representative who will give expression to their\nideals and preferences. They deliberate and choose with others about a\npublic agenda, and in so doing they cultivate abilities to form a\nconception of a common good, to take principled stands, to exchange\nreasons with others, and to learn from others.\n\nSo far, these would seem to be arguments for widespread\u2014indeed,\nuniversal\u2014direct democracy. In fact, unlike many of his\ncontemporaries interested in expanding the franchise, Mill defends the\nextension of the franchise to women too, rejecting any restriction on\ntheir franchise as baseless (479). But Mill qualifies this defense of\ndirect democracy in various significant ways.\n\nDemocracy presumably involves rule by the will of the people. We might\nsay that a political system is democratic insofar as the content of\nits political decisions reflect the will of the people. A direct\ndemocracy, in which every citizen votes on legislation, is one way for\npolitical decisions to reflect the will of the people. But direct\ndemocracy is impractical in anything but a small community (412). Mill\ndefends representative, rather than direct, democracy.\n\nMill believes that representatives are charged with the task of\nvoting, after free and open discussion, their own considered views\nabout what would promote the common good (490). Here Mill expresses\ndoubts about an interest group model of democracy, according to which\nrepresentatives are advocates of the sectarian interests of their\nconstituents and democracy is seen as an impartial aggregation and set\nof compromises among sectarian interests. Instead, Mill regards\nrepresentatives as fiduciaries in a public trust, in which each\nrepresentative aims at a genuinely common good, and in which\nindividual and collective deliberations are shaped by a diversity of\nexperiences and perspectives.\n\nMany needs are local in nature, and, even when the needs are general,\ntheir satisfaction may depend heavily on local conditions. For this\nreason, Mill advocates a federal system in which a central\nrepresentative body has more limited functions and local or municipal\nrepresentative bodies govern in matters involving local affairs or\nlocal detail, such as the creation and maintenance of local\ninfrastructure, including roads, courts, jails, and schools\n(422\u201334).\n\nHowever, one important function of a central government, Mill\nbelieves, is the need to protect local political minorities from being\nsystematically disadvantaged by local political majorities (544). Here\nhe shows his concern with individual rights against the tyranny of the\nmajority, which was a focus of On Liberty and suggests\nthat constitutional guarantees may be better preserved by central,\nrather than local, authorities. Unfortunately, he does not devote much\nattention to exactly which individual rights should be recognized\nconstitutionally.\n\nMill also insists that a representative democracy, either local or\nfederal, should employ proportional, rather than\nwinner-take-all, representation (CRG 449\u201362;\n\u201cThoughts on Parliamentary Reform\u201d 328\u201329). We can\nsee how proportional representation fits with the epistemic argument\nfor democracy. Winner-take-all representation may eliminate or reduce\neffective expression of minority points of view so essential for free\nand informed inquiry about the common good and respecting the\ninterests of political minorities (CRG 458).\n",
