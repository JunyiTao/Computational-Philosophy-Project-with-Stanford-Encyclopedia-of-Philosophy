As we have seen, this doctrine states that we should keep secret the very idea that some principles and actions should remain secret. This means that, even at a very high level of generality, there is no way we could submit any maxim for assessment to the ideal public, unless such a maxim makes no direct reference to the problem of publicity. But what about the following maxim: \u201cany means should be deemed appropriate if they serve the utilitarian ideal\u201d? Utilitarians claim that an ideal public should at least consider utilitarianism a plausible doctrine. And it is therefore unlikely that the Kantian test will lead to a \u201cnecessary and unanimous\u201d rejection of this proposed higher-order formulation of the maxim. Hence the test may be passed successfully, without any discussion on the issue of publicity. Of course, one may find such a maxim totally unjust for other reasons. But Kant himself does not seem to claim that his test should be seen as a sufficient test for justice anyway.\n1.4.2 Glomar Responses\nOur second example comes from actual Freedom of Information (FoI) regimes. That a public authority may have to justify each of its significant decisions will seem largely uncontroversial. In principle, this should also hold each time a public authority denies access to a document requested by a citizen on the basis of his FoI right. The citizen should know the grounds that access is being denied to the document he wants to double-check, e.g., whether this is because of privacy, trade secrets, or state security. However, there are cases in which disclosing the exact reason why access to a document is denied unavoidably entails the disclosure of the document\u2019s very content. One could deny access with no overt justification, implying that disclosing the precise ground for denial would be equivalent to disclosing the document\u2019s very content. Along the same lines, an authority could even refuse to deny or confirm the very existence of the requested document, which is known in US law as a Glomar response.[15]\nAgain, one may well propose a higher-order principle accounting for a response of this kind:\n\nwhenever access to a document may be denied on a legitimate basis and disclosing either the basis for denial or even the very existence of the document would jeopardize the pursuit of this very goal, a justification for denial or even the confirmation of the document\u2019s (non)-existence may be withheld.\n\nSo long as the set of such legitimate bases for denial is publicly discussed and procedural checks are in place, there is no reason to believe that publicizing such a maxim will be self-frustrating in the presence of a real public, nor that such a maxim should be rejected by an ideal public. Admittedly, the Glomar doctrine embodies some extent of \u201cmeta-secrecy\u201d. However, it does not go as far as a meta-secrecy of the kind that Sidgwick favors. For the very possibility that a state may sometimes act on secret grounds is not publicly denied, nor are the grounds for justifiable Glomar responses necessarily left outside the sphere of public discussion.[16]\n1.4.3 The Judiciary\u2019s True Goal\nFor our third example, let us suppose that the true goal of the judiciary were to promote peace and stability rather than justice. However, let us assume as well that letting people believe that the genuine goal of such institutions is justice would best guarantee peace, for decision-acceptance would be enhanced if such decisions were perceived as just (Luban 1996: 160). In such a world, there is no question that peace would better be pursued by keeping it secret as the true goal of judiciary. The maxim may be:\n\nact in a way such that if peace is best pursued by letting people think (wrongly) that it is in fact justice that is being pursued, you should let people think so.\n\nPublicizing such a maxim may be \u201cself-frustrating\u201d and would therefore not pass the Kantian test.\nHowever, besides asking ourselves whether such self-frustratingness is what accounts for the possibly unjust nature of the maxim, we may provide a higher order formulation of the maxim:\n\nAct in a way such that if one legitimate goal is best pursued by letting people think (wrongly) that it is in fact another legitimate goal that is being pursued, you should let people think so.\n\nThis higher-order maxim\u2019s publication is not self-frustrating, even in a case in which we assume that the legitimacy of each goal has been examined in detail, along with the legitimacy of other goals. Of course, this does not end the discussion since, in case we were to grant priority to justice over peace, the maxim\u2019s implementation could still lead to injustice, which the Kantian test does not exclude.\n1.4.4 The Optimal Confidentiality of FoI Laws\nLet us finally move to an example that deals again with real FoI regimes. One of the surprises of such regimes is that, as a matter of fact, their very existence remains rather confidential in many countries. Citizens do not exercise their right of access to state-detained documents as much as one might expect. This could be regarded as unfortunate. One may as well consider it necessary, however, at least if we find meaningful the idea of an optimal level of confidentiality of FoI regimes. This optimal level would consist in some active citizens being maximally aware of its existence, and all civil servants being as little aware of it as possible. For if (non-ideal) civil servants know that they are potentially being watched, they may admittedly try to change their behavior for the better. However, they may simultaneously want to hide even further the more problematic aspects of their behavior (e.g., through shifting from written to oral discussions). In other words, in order for the fundamental FoI right to be maximally effective, its existence and exercise may have to remain relatively covert, perhaps unequally known.\nWhat should an ideal public think about the following maxim then: \u201cIn order for a legitimate goal to be pursued, while the goal itself would be fully public (here: the accountability of public authorities), while the social expectations of citizens towards civil servants would be fully transparent, some of the means enabling such citizens to ensure the accountability of public authorities may remain covert\u201d? Not each and every covert means is acceptable. However, the one consisting in a right to ask for a copy of administrative documents may very well be so. Of course, publicizing a lower order version of this maxim may be self-frustrating, hence incapable of passing the Kantian test. But again, this is not sufficient to discard this lower order maxim as unjust, nor does it mean that a higher-order translation of it (as suggested above) must be unable to pass the Kantian test.\nThese four examples leave us with two important open questions regarding the Kantian test. First, how should we assess the test\u2019s importance if the level of generality at which the maxim of an action should be phrased cannot be normatively fixed? As we have illustrated above, the lower the level of generality at which a maxim is phrased, the higher the risk that its publicity would be self-frustrating, and vice versa (Luban 1996: 189\u2013191). No doubt, the test would be over-exclusive if we were forced to phrase our maxims at a very low level of generality. This is clear when we think about keeping secret the date of a police intervention to trap criminals or the location of a stock of weapons in times of peace. Kant himself never suggests that all secret actions should be ruled out by his test. The problem is that, as long as we do not have any indication as to the appropriate level of generality at which an action\u2019s maxim should be tested, the opposite risk of under-exclusiveness becomes hard to avoid as our four examples above illustrate.\nSecond, it is not entirely clear why self-frustratingness (or purpose-frustratingness) is an indicator of injustice. In other words, whenever the Kantian test bites, why would this tell us anything about the just or unjust nature of a maxim and the actions that fall under it?[17] Answering this question is even more crucial for those who\u2014contrary to us\u2014view the publicity test as a necessary and sufficient condition for permissibility. What we need then is an account of the \u201cintrinsic connection\u201d between self-frustratingness and injustice\u2014in the same way as one may ask why, for contractualists, there should be a significant connection between justice and the hypothetical agreements of fairly-situated individuals. Such an account is not provided by Kant, who claims about the principle that \u201clike an axiom, it is indemonstrably certain\u201d (1795 [1923: 382]). One sound suggestion is Luban\u2019s (1996: 191). Imagine that making the maxim of my action public would frustrate my ability to reach this maxim\u2019s very goal. This can be taken as a sign of the injustice of this maxim only if the frustration-generating mechanism is at least in part based itself on morally justifiable grounds. But if publicizing a doctrine generates distrust from a real audience merely because of people\u2019s attraction for simplicity or non-demandingness, the frustration flowing from such a distrust might hardly be considered relevant to the assessment of the maxim\u2019s (in)justice.\n2. Actual Publicity\nActual publicity can be looked at through the prism of hypothetical publicity. However, philosophers approach the issue from other angles as well. Their arguments have mobilized both empirical assumptions and philosophical claims regarding the purpose of voting and political representation, the importance of participation and deliberation, etc. Here, we examine more closely arguments in favor and against actual publicity in the political arena. In order to do so, we will restrict ourselves to two modes of political action (voting and deliberation) and two types of actors (electors and representatives). In so doing, we consider two types of relationships: horizontal ones (among voters or among representatives) and vertical ones (between voters and representatives). Notice already that the view one favors regarding the function attached to one\u2019s vote as a member of the electorate and to one\u2019s activity as a representative will have an impact on the reasons why publicity may matter and the extent to which it does.\nBefore engaging in this philosophical discussion, let us clarify what the arguments developed below may show for one significant practical evolution, namely the development of FoI regimes in democratic countries during the second half of the 20th century.[18] Such regimes have been set up with the view of allowing citizens to participate more actively in public affairs, enabling them to have access to the details of most administrative documents in due time.[19] Hence, not only MPs but civil servants become more effectively accountable. This means that citizens are not forced simply to accept package deals from their representatives at the time of elections. They can question the practicalities of implementation at any time.\nNot only does the enactment of FoI regimes provide opportunities for multiple interactions between active citizens and state authorities, they also force us to weigh the relative importance of open government vis-a-vis other fundamental rights. Specific grounds for denying access to administrative documents include the protection of privacy, property rights (e.g., trade secrets), easing the gathering of information from third parties (e.g., executive privilege[20] or medical secrecy), paternalistic justifications (e.g., in the case of technical documents that could be misinterpreted), state interests (e.g., in defense and terrorism matters or international negotiations), and economic efficiency (e.g., in public procurement, the content of the offer made by competitors being disclosed only after the final decision). Sometimes, such grounds for secrecy will justify strict denial of access. On other occasions, the disclosure of information will be deferred (e.g., through declassification procedures) or be selective (e.g., to some types of actors only). This variety of potential justifications of secrecy and the diverse ways of accommodating the conflicting values constitute a largely unexplored terrain for applied political philosophy. Here, we will focus only on general reasons to promote or restrict actual publicity.\n2.1 Voting\n2.1.1 Mill\u2019s (1861) Case Against Secret Ballot\nLet us look at voting first. We may begin with the view according to which the electoral process aims only at aggregating people\u2019s individual preferences regarding the type of decisions they consider in their own interest (rather than in the public interest). Under such a view, there is no strong case for making sure that my fellow citizen be able to know what my actual preferences are. This is especially significant when it comes to direct democracy (e.g., a referendum). However, in democratic systems involving representation, there may be weighty reasons for representatives to know which type of electors they are representing, and hence to favor open ballots. This implies that, even under an \u201caggregation of private interests\u201d view of democracy, there may be a case for open ballots. This case has nothing to do with the need for fellow voters to know about their neighbor\u2019s actual preferences. Only their representatives need to know about them.\nLet us now move to a different conception of democracy, advocated by Mill:\n\nIn any political election, even by universal suffrage (and still more obviously in the case of a restricted suffrage), the voter is under an absolute moral obligation to consider the interest of the public, not his private advantage, and give his vote, to the best of his judgment, exactly as he would be bound to do if he were the sole voter, and the election depended upon him alone. This being admitted, it is at least a prima facie consequence that the duty of voting, like any other public duty, should be performed under the eye and criticism of the public; every one of whom has not only an interest in its performance, but a good title to consider himself wronged if it is performed otherwise than honestly and carefully. Undoubtedly neither this nor any other maxim of political morality is absolutely inviolable; it may be overruled by still more cogent considerations. But its weight is such that the cases which admit of a departure from it must be of a strikingly exceptional character (1861 [1991: 355]).\n\nMill later discusses whether such reasons to depart from publicity are forceful, which is an issue to which we shall return. However, what matters here is that, once we consider that voters are supposed to vote according to what they believe would promote the public interest, rather than their own private interests,[21] the case for publicity is reversed. On the one hand, if we can associate to such a conception of voting one of representation according to which representatives are supposed to defend the public interest, rather than the class interests of their identifiable electors,[22] the case for vertical publicity weakens. For knowing who their electors actually are may induce MPs to stick to a defense of their actual electors rather than to promote the public interest at large. On the other hand, the very act of taking part in an election acquires a non-private dimension, such that we should consider ourselves accountable towards our fellow citizens (horizontal accountability). And the claim that we should regard ourselves as horizontally accountable towards those who may be affected by the consequences of our choices clearly supports the case against secret ballots. For Mill, this is a very significant reason for open ballots. In fact, he even stresses that, as electors, we should see ourselves accountable not only towards fellow electors, but also to non-electors whenever the franchise is not as universal as it could be (which generates the risk of electors voting only to defend their class interests as voters).[23] The example from Mill\u2019s times is the one of women, who were excluded from \u201cmanhood suffrage\u201d. Present day illustrations could refer to non-national residents excluded from the right to vote or to those below the age of majority.[24]\n2.1.2 Why Worry About Open Vote?\nMill was not the first to write about vote secrecy. Authors such as Cicero (III.15), Montesquieu,[25] Jean-Jacques Rousseau[26] and Alexis de Tocqueville[27] also expressed their views on the matter. And Mill\u2019s intervention is in fact part of a lively debate that had been going on in England for several decades.[28] He writes:\n\nIt may, unquestionably, be the fact that if we attempt, by publicity, to make the voter responsible to the public for his vote, he will practically be made responsible for it to some powerful individual, whose interest is more opposed to the general interest of the community than that of the voter himself would be if, by the shield of secrecy, he were released from responsibility altogether. When this is the condition, in a high degree, of a large proportion of the voters, the ballot may be the smaller evil. When the voters are slaves, anything may be tolerated which enables them to throw off the yoke. The strongest case for the ballot is when the mischievous power of the Few over the Many is increasing [\u2026].\nBut in the more advanced states of modern Europe, and especially in this country, the power of coercing voters has declined and is declining; and bad voting is now less to be apprehended from the influences to which the voter is subject at the hands of others than from the sinister interests and discreditable feelings which belong to himself, either individually or as a member of a class. To secure him against the first, at the cost of removing all restraint from the last, would be to exchange a smaller and a diminishing evil for a greater and increasing one [\u2026] (Mill, 1861 [1991: 355\u2013357]).[29]\n\nGeoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit (1990) revived Mill\u2019s argument, contending that, while we should not assume that people will generally tend to vote according to their private interest whenever voting is secret, unveiling the vote would certainly encourage further the practice of voting in accordance with what one considers to be the common good (Brennan and Pettit 1990: 325\u2013329). They argue as well that the case for open votes is especially strong in pluralistic societies involving large electorates.[30]\nStill, Mill\u2019s lesser-evil type of justification for open votes has been rejected in the past on at least three grounds. First, one could question the very purpose that Mill ascribes to voting. Hence, some of the protagonists of the 19th century British debate criticized the view according to which voting should be regarded as a trust rather than a right.[31] In contrast with Mill\u2019s view, this entails that ballot secrecy is not even a lesser evil. It is no evil at all. Second, one may disagree with Mill at the factual level rather than at the normative one. James Mill, his father, clearly agreed with his son on the purpose of voting, referring explicitly on various occasions to the idea of a trust. In his long essay \u201cOn the Ballot\u201d, he states that \u201cThe voter for a member of Parliament has a trust placed in his hands, on the discharge of which the highest interests of his country depend\u201d.[32] However, James Mill considered\u2014in opposition to his son\u2019s view\u2014that the negative consequences attached to the secret ballot were not only less weighty than its advantages, but devoid of any weight at all.[33] This entails that for James Mill as well, secret voting was not even a lesser evil reform. It did not involve any evil at all. Third, let us consider Bentham\u2019s position. Although he does not refer explicitly to the trust-based view of voting, he considers that voters should be influenced by tutelary motives. For him,\n\nin judging whether a motive ought to be referred to the class of seductive or tutelary motives, it is necessary to examine whether, in the case in question, it tends [\u2026] to favour the greatest or the smallest number (Bentham 1843 [1999: 145]).[34]\n\nAfter balancing the pros and cons of publicity, Bentham concludes:\n\nThe system of secrecy has therefore a useful tendency in those circumstances in which publicity exposes the voter to the influence of a particular interest opposed to the public interest. Secrecy is therefore in general suitable in elections.\n\nIn contrast with James Mill, Bentham\u2019s argument is of the lesser-evil type. But contrary to J.S. Mill, it is a lesser-evil argument in favor of secrecy rather than publicity.[35]\nSuch developments may be dismissed as being of merely historical interest. And indeed, except for Brennan and Pettit\u2019s (1990) work, there is little contemporary debate about the justifiability of the secret ballot. Rather, the discussion has shifted its focus to parliamentary debate and to administrative activity, such as FoIs. Still, there are at least three lessons to be learnt from older debates about the ballot, over and above the fact that vote secrecy is not unambiguously costless. First, already at that time, there were attempts at envisaging simultaneously the questions of vote secrecy in the case of electors and in the case of representatives.[36] The interesting fact is that we do not today have a clear theory telling us why we should have secret ballots for electors and open votes in plenary parliamentary sessions. Simply referring to the fact that representatives are accountable to their electors (vertical accountability) in a sense in which electors are not to their fellow citizens (horizontal accountability) is insufficient in itself. Ceteris paribus, the importance of horizontal accountability, insofar as it emphasizes the need to justify our decisions to those who may endure their consequences, could suffice to justify openness. Moreover, it is probably also insufficient to claim that the fact that representatives may lose their job as a result of electoral discontent is not as problematic as the fact that electors could lose their job if their employer were to know for whom they voted. This does not mean that differences are absent. Ceteris paribus, a representative has more power than a citizen, for example.[37] What we need to ask ourselves is whether this is sufficient to justify treating the two categories so differently with regard to vote publicity.\nSecond, open voting in parliament may not only give room to pressure from your actual electors, it may also lead to pressure from those who did not actually vote for you or from well-organized lobbies defending some specific interests. This is probably one of the concerns today in many countries. Publicity allows the electors to use the threat of non-reelection in full knowledge of what a representative actually did. Still, it allows as well other actors to do so, who may neither be the representative\u2019s actual electors, nor lobbies acting in the name of the general interest. Though employers and landowners may not pressure employees and landless people anymore, lobbyists representing the former do pressure the MPs elected by the latter, with comparable results. This indicates how pressure made possible through publicity may effectively force representatives to take directions that do not fit with the view of the public interest defended by those who elect them. Pressure is a double-edged sword. This may call for at least mixed systems, a proposal to which we shall return shortly. It may even justify taking more seriously the possibility of vote anonymity in parliament, provided that the number of votes for and against each proposal be known anyway.\nFinally, one may consider that the only way of dealing with such issues consists in obtaining empirical evidence regarding the respective effects of secrecy and publicity and weighing them up.[38] More principled arguments could be developed however. Such principled arguments could take at least two (non-exclusive) forms. According to one strategy, even in a society where the level of coercion on voters is very weak on average, it is reasonable to assume that those who will suffer most from such risk of coercion (given their higher dependence on others) are the least advantaged. There may thus be a maximin case for secret ballots on such grounds, putting priority on the protection of the most vulnerable. The other strategy would consist in stressing the fact that the extent to which the coercion of voters obtains in a given society may fluctuate, and hence evolve at some point for the worse, in line with political or economic degradations. A preventive approach would thus consist in claiming that, once coercion increases to an extent such that it becomes worrying (provided that there are levels of coercion that would not be worrying in the first place), it would then be too late to switch back to secret voting. This could justify preserving vote secrecy from the start, even when the risk of coercion is currently negligible.[39]\n2.2 Deliberation\n2.2.1 Can Publicity Civilize Representatives?\nLet us now turn to the issue of public deliberation. Notice first that the arguments for open ballots invoked above in the context of an \u201caggregation of private interests\u201d view of voting, equally justify the publicity of debates taking place between representatives. This is because these individuals have interests in learning about each other. An implication of this fact is that, in a system in which vertical accountability matters, it is essential both for citizens to know what their representatives think and do, and for representatives to know more than once every four years how the electorate reacts to their arguments and decisions.\nLearning about each other is one thing. Learning from each other (about facts, what to think, or how to act) is another, however.[40] Publicity is not supposed to allow only for citizens and their representatives to act upon fixed preferences regarding their private or even the public interests. The interactions that publicity enables are also potentially rich in transformative power. Such a dynamic impact can take various forms. Publicity of deliberations between representatives may play an exemplary role for citizens (both procedurally and substantively), as suggested by Bentham, who writes that\n\nthe order which reigns in the discussion of a political assembly, will form by imitation the national spirit. This order will be reproduced in clubs and inferior assemblies, in which the people will be pleased to find the regularity of which they have formed the idea from the greater model (Bentham 1843 [1999: 31]).[41]\n\nSimilarly, we have seen that open ballots can incentivize electors to restrict themselves in public to positions that they see themselves as being able to justify to other fellow citizens. And this is true even when their fellow citizens are not especially educated, as Mill argued:\n\nThe notion is itself unfounded, that publicity, and the sense of being answerable to the public, are of no use unless the public are qualified to form a sound judgment. It is a very superficial view of the utility of public opinion to suppose that it does good only when it succeeds in enforcing a servile conformity to itself. To be under the eyes of others\u2014to have to defend oneself to others\u2014is never more important than to those who act in opposition to the opinion of others, for it obliges them to have sure ground of their own. Nothing has so steadying an influence as working against pressure. Unless when under the temporary sway of passionate excitement, no one will do that which he expects to be greatly blamed for, unless from a preconceived and fixed purpose of his own; which is always evidence of a thoughtful and deliberate character, and, except in radically bad men, generally proceeds from sincere and strong personal convictions. Even the bare fact of having to give an account of their conduct is a powerful inducement to adhere to conduct of which at least some decent account can be given. If any one thinks that the mere obligation of preserving decency is not a very considerable check on the abuse of power, he has never had his attention called to the conduct of those who do not feel under the necessity of observing that restraint. Publicity is inappreciable, even when it does no more than prevent that which can by no possibility be plausibly defended\u2014than compel deliberation, and force every one to determine, before he acts, what he shall say if called to account for his actions (1861 [1991: 360\u2013361]).[42]\n\nNow, let us suppose that Bentham is correct to suggest that representatives can civilize their electorate through public deliberation, and that Mill is correct to suggest that voters may be civilized by their not-necessarily-civilized fellow voters (and non-voters) in case of open ballots. Elster presents still another view according to which the publicity of deliberation can assist citizens in civilizing their representatives. Elster refers to this as \u201cthe civilizing force of hypocrisy\u201d, and the central passage is the following:\n\nGenerally speaking, the effect of an audience is to replace the language of interest by the language of reason and to replace impartial motives by passionate ones. The presence of a public makes it especially hard to appear motivated merely by self-interest. Even if one\u2019s fellow assembly members would not be shocked, the audience would be. In general, this civilizing force of hypocrisy is a desirable effect of publicity. [\u2026] Publicity does not eliminate base motives, but forces and induces speakers to hide them (Elster 1998a: 111; Naurin 2003).\n\nThe Filter\nElster\u2019s argument occurs in two steps. The first one is the filtering step, and it starts with the idea that the public holds normative expectations regarding what representatives are supposed to say.[43] One of these expectations is that any overt reference to mere self-interest is deemed unacceptable in the course of justifying their position,[44] which leaves open the question of whether it is acceptable to refer to the self-interest of their class of electors.[45] Another expectation is that representatives must justify their position by referring to minimally general principles. Finally, there is also a social norm favoring argument over bargaining,[46] such that, whenever the debate takes place in public, deliberation oriented towards the force of the better argument should be promoted. At the very least, the entails the need to disguise overt threats as warnings (Elster 1998a: 103\u2013104). Normative expectations such as these that regard acceptable discourse thus act as a filter on what representatives are permitted to say. Importantly, it is not hypocrisy as such that filters out the set of unacceptable speech elements. However, it allows the representative to engage in a discourse in which he does not necessarily believe. In other words, this account does not necessarily presuppose a normative expectation among the public that politicians ought to be sincere.[47] Actually, hypocrisy is rather an enabling factor (allowing for an initial gap between what is said and thought), and not a cleaning up factor.\nDoes this argument presuppose that voters be on average more civilized than their representatives? At least two types of answers can be provided. First, there are reasons of principle to doubt that representatives are on average wiser or more committed to the common good than their electorate. As Luban writes,\n\n\u2026 the empirical validity of the publicity principle turns not on whether the Many are ignorant or wrong-headed, but on whether their leaders are less ignorant or less wrong-headed. No doubt the Wise are few; and the leaders are few; but it hardly follows that the leaders are wise. Before we reject the publicity principle because the leaders know best, we must have reason to believe that the leaders know better. And to find that out, we must look carefully at the variety of mechanisms by which decision-making elites are actually selected. If actual selection mechanisms choose randomly between the Many and the Wise, or affirmatively disfavor the Wise, then the foolishness of the many is irrelevant: the Few in official positions have no reason to suppose that their policy brainstorms are any less foolish (Luban 1996: 193).\n\nSecond, the average level of civilization may be less relevant than the presence of at least a minority of civilized members. As Mill puts it, \u201c[\u2026] cases exist [\u2026] in which almost the only restraint upon a majority of knaves consists in their involuntary respect for the opinion of an honest minority\u201d (1861 [1991: 362]). In line with this Millian view, were the average level of civilization among representatives higher or equivalent to the one obtaining within the electorate, publicity could still increase in absolute terms the amount of civilized persons attending the representative\u2019s discourse, adding civilized members of the public to those who are civilized in parliament. Hence, through such a sampling effect, if we agree with Mill that the mere presence of a civilized minority can make some difference, a larger absolute size of such a minority might be relevant. As for Elster, he explicitly relies more directly on a multiplier effect, insisting that \u201ca small group of impartially minded individuals might induce many others to mimic their impartiality out of self-interest\u201d (Elster 1995: 249). And as Elster points out, this is even more true whenever there is uncertainty as to who these impartially minded people are (Elster 1995: 248).\nReducing cognitive dissonance\nLet us now turn to the second step in Elster\u2019s argument (Elster 1986, \u00a7II). There is an additional normative expectation that, once representatives commit themselves in public to a given view, they ought not to switch to another view unless they can justify such a departure (Elster 1998a: 104). As Elster puts it,\n\npublic speaking is subject to a consistency constraint. Once a speaker has adopted an impartial argument because it corresponds to his interest or prejudice, he will be seen as opportunistic if he deviates from it when it ceases to serve his needs (Elster 1998a: 104).[48]\n\nCitizens may be more or less vigilant regarding compliance with such a requirement that demands consistency through time. Still, it is likely to have some weight. Furthermore, as representatives cannot publicly depart from the principled views they have expressed earlier, they may begin believing in what they say, even though they may not have been holding such views at the time they began expressing them.[49] Hence, being forced to restrict oneself to publicly acceptable views may turn out to influence what one eventually believes. This is because, in order to reduce the dissonance between what one says and what one believes, a representative may come genuinely to believe what one is expected to say. Civilizing people\u2019s speech will eventually civilize their mind (and hopefully in turn their non-linguistic actions) and\u2014so Elster claims\u2014\u201con the average, [\u2026] yield more equitable outcomes\u201d (Elster 1995: 251). What begins as a strategic use of a non-self-interested arguments ends up leading to preference change (Fearon 1998: 54).\nA related line of argument is offered by Robert Goodin, who contends that individuals have a latent moral sense, and that having to state arguments in public acts as a reminder of what they already agree with. Crucially, they might not otherwise have connected the issue at stake with the principles they endorse.[50] One way of contrasting Goodin\u2019s position with Elster\u2019s view is the following. What is at stake would be as much a matter of reducing dissonance between what one says and what one genuinely believes, as one of reducing dissonance between two separate beliefs one holds.\nHaving explored Elster\u2019s claims concerned the civilizing force of hypocrisy, there are two empirical questions to be asked. First, are Elster\u2019s factual assumptions empirically plausible? Second, are there no other negative side effects relating to publicity that might outweigh the benefits identified by Elster? In the next section, we provide elements that may be relevant to answering the latter question. Let us briefly address the first challenge here. Daniel Naurin (2004) provides some interesting evidence in this respect. On the one hand, he refers to a study by Christian Joerges and Jurgen Neyer (1997) that looks closely at European Union comitology committees. Their study indicates that public-spirited deliberation can be present in such committees whose existence is unknown to most people. This may seem reassuring as it suggests that publicity is not necessary to foster truly deliberative behavior. However, on the other hand, Naurin refers to evidence from Nina Eliasoph (1998: 7) suggesting that, in the case of activists, while in backroom conversations these individuals tend to express themselves with reference to justice and common good concerns, shifting to a front stage context also increases their use of self-regarding arguments. Naurin\u2019s (2004) own empirical data illustrate a similar trend in the case of industry lobbyists in the European Union context. In other words, a forum-like type of behavior is already present in the lobby corridor. Surprisingly enough, bringing lobbyists from the backstage to the front stage therefore risks making things worse from the point of view of reducing reference to mere self-interest. One should admittedly be cautious in extrapolating such results.[51] Still, both Eliasoph and Naurin identify a phenomenon that goes in the opposite direction of what Elster\u2019s view implies. This is clearly a serious challenge to his account.\n2.2.2 The Quality of Deliberation\nThe variety of effects of publicity on the nature of the deliberation process is an understudied matter. We have already looked at some considerations, asking ourselves whether publicity substitutes public-interest-oriented to self-regarding arguments, and whether it leads to a shift from bargaining to deliberation. Here, leaving Elster\u2019s account aside for a moment, we go on with examining other dimensions of what can be referred to\u2014in an admittedly vague manner\u2014as the quality of the debate. We start with the possibility that publicity risks modifying the nature of a discussion in ways that are not desirable. One such negative side-effect, as identified by James Madison in 1787 in the case of the American Constitutional Convention, is the following:\n\nHad the members committed themselves publicly at first, they would have afterwards supposed consistency required them to maintain their ground, whereas by secret discussion no man felt himself obliged to retain his opinions any longer than he was satisfied of their propriety and truth, and was open to the force of argument.[52]\n\nThe idea of sticking to a position and being unwilling to depart from it, despite the existence of good arguments, can be a problem for at least two reasons.[53] Consensus will be harder to reach because of such stubbornness, which matters whenever agreement can be reached only by consensus (be it in a deliberation or in a bargaining type of context). More importantly, we may be worried not (only) by actors\u2019 lack of sincerity, but by the loss in debate spontaneity.[54] Unless the deliberating parties are able to try out ideas, to show hesitation,[55] and to re-consider the issues again and again with a fresh eye, actual deliberations may be no more than the juxtaposition of pre-prepared statements with no genuine interaction taking place.[56] Part of the problem here is that the public may view hesitation and trial and error as signs of a lack of commitment, which may disadvantage those representatives truly taking part in the discussion, hence inhibiting them from adopting a genuinely deliberative posture. And as Naurin puts it,\n\n[\u2026] if deliberation is about transforming preferences, and publicity forces you to know what you want and stand by your position, then \u201cpublic deliberation\u201d is something of a contradiction in terms (Naurin 2003: 32).\n\nBecause of this, if we value deliberation as a living interaction with real transformative power, there may be a strong case for at least some proportion of political deliberation to take place behind closed-doors, despite the latter\u2019s negative side-effects.[57]\nEllen Meade and David Stasavage (2008) document another way in which publicity might negatively affect the quality of deliberation. They deal with the specific case of central banks and whether minutes of board meetings should be released. Based on empirical evidence, they show how, under conditions of publicity, the fact that expert advisors may have career concerns reduces the chances of dissent being expressed during deliberation. Here, what is at stake is not whether one sticks to one\u2019s own initial position. Rather, it has to do with whether one is ready to show disagreement with the position taken by another expert who is highly regarded and has spoken first.[58] Hence, publicity might generate disincentives both to openly changing one\u2019s mind and, in some contexts, to dissenting with other (authoritative) people\u2019s views.\nSimone Chambers (2004) points at still another negative impact of publicity on the quality of deliberation. Discussion behind closed doors will admittedly tend to allow for the expression of particularistic reasons that would not pass the test of actual publicity. However, while making deliberation public might force the deliberating parties both to provide the best possible reasons in support of their claims (Socratic effect) and to provide public reasons (democratic effect) in the sense of reasons that should refer to the public interest and be acceptable to a wide audience in a pluralistic society, one problem remains.[59] It is that publicity also tends to favor reasons that are \u201cplebiscitary\u201d in the sense of shallow or manipulative (Chambers 2004: 393). Moving from private, particularistic reasons to truly public reasons may then often have an associated price, i.e., shifting from profound (private) reasons to shallow (public) reasons. Admittedly, the reason why such shallow reasons prosper might have to do with the need for a common denominator, which could be needed in a deliberation behind closed doors as well. However, it is plausible that it may also have to do with an attempt at pleasing the public and thus giving way to populism.\nThese are just a few illustrations of possible negative side effects of bringing deliberation under the public eye. It may become less lively, leave less room for dissent in the presence of an authoritative member, and favor shallower types of arguments, no matter how rational and public they are. It is important to identify exactly which benefits and which costs are attached to actual publicity and secrecy, and what their respective weight might be. In this respect, it is true that the argument may be of a different nature or at least carry a different weight depending on whether one deals with voting or deliberation. For instance, the importance of learning from each other (rather than simply about each other) may provide a stronger argument for open public deliberation than for open ballots.\nOnce all normative and empirical dimensions have been carefully considered, we may want to adopt a firm standpoint regarding the need for publicity or secrecy in deliberation and voting in general. However, we may also want to try to mix secrecy and publicity in ways that allow for more optimal schemes, providing us with the best of both worlds. Let us illustrate the availability of this option by pointing at two of such schemes. First, Bentham refers to a system obtaining in the Polish Permanent Council in the late 18th century by which an open vote was followed by a secret vote on the very same issue (Bentham 1843 [1999: 147\u2013148]). Second, Elster argues that a constitution-making process\n\nought to contain elements of both secrecy (committee discussion) and publicity (plenary assembly discussions). With total secrecy, partisan interests and logrolling come to the forefront, whereas full publicity encourages grandstanding and rhetorical overbidding. Conversely, secrecy allows for serious discussion, whereas publicity ensures that any deals struck are capable of withstanding the light of day (Elster 1998a: 117).\n\nOne can thus mix both publicity and secrecy in the case of voting (Bentham) or deliberation (Elster), through a succession of openness and secrecy (Bentham)[60] or secrecy and openness (Elster).[61] One could also advocate for mixing public deliberation with a secret vote (which is probably a correct description of what happens during electoral periods in many democratic countries), or, conversely, secret deliberation and a public vote (which is what actually takes place in parliamentary systems with secret commissions in which plenary debates take a purely formal dimension). Each of these regimes has specific properties that may warrant separate study.\n3. Rawls on Public Reason and Public Rules\nHaving looked at both hypothetical publicity and actual publicity, let us now turn to examine the place of publicity within the political philosophy of John Rawls. We shall analyze two distinct conceptions of publicity that arise in his writings. The first relates to the doctrine of public reason. The second relates to the doctrine of public rules. Though we begin with some remarks about public reason, we shall focus predominantly on public rules, as this idea is less familiar.\n3.1 The Doctrine of Public Reason\nStated in a quite general way, the doctrine of public reason holds that, when justifying the exercise of political power, we ought to appeal exclusively to reasons that all \u201ccitizens as free and equal may reasonably be expected to endorse in the light of principles and ideals acceptable to their common human reason\u201d (Rawls 1996, 137). So as to highlight their shared nature, we can call these public reasons.\nIn contrast with public reasons, there are non-public reasons. These reasons are controversial, in the sense that they are not reasons that we can expect all reasonable citizens to accept. Their possibility emerges from the fact of reasonable pluralism (Rawls 1996: 36\u201339), which refers to the idea that, in any society in which basic rights are protected, citizens will inevitably disagree about the worth of competing conceptions of the good life. The doctrine of public reason states that, because certain reasons are controversial, we ought not to appeal to them when making the case for the political legislation we support. In this respect, the doctrine calls for a kind of justificatory restraint (Rawls 1996: 447).[62]\nTo illustrate, let us consider the case of a Christian, who is opposed to abortion for religious reasons. The doctrine of public reason holds that, even though this citizen may act on these reasons in her own personal life, she ought not to appeal to her religious beliefs in order to oppose the legal right to abortion. This is because her Christian reasons are not ones that we can reasonably expect others to endorse. Instead, if she wishes to oppose the legislation, she must offer reasons that are shared by all reasonable citizens (Rawls 1996: 243 n. 32).\nOne concern with the doctrine of public reason is that, by asking citizens to set aside certain controversial reasons in political decision-making, it invites them to misrepresent their beliefs in various ways. This is the Insincerity Objection. For example, the Christian who is prohibited from appealing to her religious beliefs in order to oppose the legal right to abortion may decide to offer an argument that she does not find persuasive, but that she hopes others will, in order to advance her political agenda. This may be objectionable for a number of reasons, including because it may reduce the quality of political deliberation (Quong 2011: ch. 9; Schwartzman 2011).\nA further concern is that the doctrine of public reason proves too much. This is because we disagree about almost all values, including political values. Even when we use political power in seemingly just ways, such as in the name of equality of opportunity, say, we must appeal to controversial reasons that are not widely accepted. Does it follow that we cannot reasonably expect citizens to endorse those reasons, and, if so, isn\u2019t the doctrine of public reason too restrictive? Or, despite such disagreement, can we still reasonably expect their endorsement? If so, why can\u2019t we also reasonably expect citizens to endorse other controversial reasons, such as those that derive from religious beliefs? Proponents of the doctrine must answer these questions by explaining why we may treat disagreements about political values differently from disagreements about conceptions of the good life. For this reason, we can call it the Asymmetry Objection (Caney 1995; Fowler and Stemplowska 2015; Sandel 1994; Waldron 1994).\nThe precise formulation of the doctrine of public reason is subject to further variation. Among other factors, it will depend upon (1) how we discriminate between the reasons that we can and cannot reasonably expect others to endorse; (2) whether its demands apply broadly to any matter of public concern or narrowly only to the essentials of a political constitution (Kelly 2013; Quong 2011: ch. 9); and (3) whether we acknowledge that there may be conditions under which the doctrine is defeated by other considerations, such concerns for religious salvation, for example (Rawls 1996: 152; Clayton and Stevens 2014).\nThough the arguments we discuss below provide partial answers to these questions, we shall not explicitly discuss these issues here. Instead, our goal is to outline the various arguments in defence of the idea of public reason. These arguments clarify the demands of public reason, as well as inform our later analysis of public rules.\nWe can distinguish three distinct justifications for the doctrine, each of which finds support within Rawls\u2019s texts:\n\nThe Political Autonomy Argument\nThe Civic Friendship Argument\nThe Stability Argument\n\nThe Political Autonomy Argument begins with the claim that each citizen has a weighty interest in being politically autonomous\u2014that is, in freely identifying with the constraints that she faces, such that she fully comprehends and endorses the justification of those constraints (Rawls 1996: 402).[63] Only by justifying the exercise of political power by appeal exclusively to public reasons can we protect citizens\u2019 interest in political autonomy.[64] After all, what distinguishes public reasons from non-public reasons is that the former are ones that we can reasonably expect everyone to endorse and to act upon.\nOne objection to this argument comes from those who deny that citizens have a weighty interest in being politically autonomous. These critics target the fact that it is possible to justify the kind of justificatory restraint imposed by the doctrine of public reason only if this interest is sufficiently weighty. If the interest were not very weighty, or if there were no interest at all, then it is difficult to see why we ought to exercise the kind of justificatory restraint that the doctrine of public reason calls for, especially since it prevents us from appealing to a certain class of sound reasons (Raz 1986; Wall 1998).\nThe second justification for the doctrine of public reason is the Civic Friendship Argument. On this view, we can justify the doctrine by appeal to its role in enabling citizens jointly to maintain just institutions, and thereby realise a form of civic friendship. Public reason is central to this task since the joint pursuit of justice is possible only if citizens \u201caffirm the same political conception of justice\u201d and so \u201cshare one very basic political end\u201d (Rawls 1996: 202).\nPolitical autonomy and civic friendship are distinct ideals. Unlike political autonomy, civic friendship is an essentially common good\u2014its benefits cannot be enjoyed by an individual in isolation but can be enjoyed only with others. Only citizens who relate to each other in a particular way\u2014that is, as joint pursuers of a shared conception of justice\u2014can enjoy this kind of civic friendship (Rawls 1996: 204; Leland and Wietmarschen 2017; Lister 2013; Ebels-Duggan 2010; Schwarzenbach 1996, 2005; Watson and Hartley 2018). Elaborating upon the idea of essentially common goods, Rawls writes,\n\nThat there should be such a political and social good is no more mysterious than that members of an orchestra, or players on a team, or even both teams in a game, should take pleasure and a certain (proper) pride in a good performance, or in a play of the game, one that they will want to remember (Rawls 1996: 204).\n\nThe success of the Civic Friendship Argument depends upon two claims. The first is that it is not possible, or at least it is much more difficult, for citizens to realise civic friendship in ways other than by upholding the doctrine of public reason. Some deny this claim, instead maintaining that forms of democracy that do not uphold the doctrine of public reason can fare equally as well in this regard (Billingham 2016; Caney 1995; Kogelmann 2017). The second is that citizens\u2019 interest in realising civic friendship is sufficiently weighty so as to justify the kind of restraint imposed by the doctrine of public reason (Caney 1995).\nThe third justification of the doctrine of public reason is the Stability Argument. This argument emphasizes the alleged psychological fact that citizens are more likely to support principles and institutions that they themselves see as just (Rawls 1996: 140\u20134; Weithman 2011). This implies that, if we want to extend the life-expectancy of our institutions, then we should favour principles and institutions that will predictably generate their own support (Freeman 2007b: ch. 3). This counts in favour of the doctrine of public reason, whose defining claim is that we may appeal only to those reasons that we can reasonably expect others to endorse.\nUnlike the previous two arguments, the Stability Argument is purely instrumental. It sees citizens\u2019 support for the principles and institutions to which they are subject as valuable only insofar as it enhances the stability of those principles and institutions. Of course, this is not to say that stability is always valuable: instead, the stability of a set of institutions is valuable only if those institutions meet other moral standards, such as if they treat citizens justly.\n3.2 The Doctrine of Public Rules\nWhereas the doctrine of public reason restricts the reasons to which we may appeal, the doctrine of public rules regulates the character of the requirements that principles of justice may produce.[65] More specifically, it states that we have weighty reasons to prefer principles of justice that can serve as a public standard, in the senses that they are (i) not self-effacing; and yield demands (ii) that are sufficiently determinate and accessible, and (iii) compliance with which is sufficiently verifiable to others (Rawls 1996: 66\u201367; Rawls 1999a: 48\u201349; see also Williams 1998: 233). We explain each of these properties in turn.\nFirst, principles of justice provide a public standard only if they are not self-effacing\u2014that is, only if the success of the principles from which the rules derive does not depend upon some citizens being ignorant of these principles, or upon some citizens being ignorant of others\u2019 knowledge of these principles (see \u00a71.3.1). In other words, the idea of publicity requires mutual knowledge, and not mere general knowledge (see \u00a71.1). In clarifying what he means by a public system of rules, Rawls writes,\n\nI mean then that everyone engaged in it knows what he would know if these rules and his participation in the activity they define were the result of an agreement\u2026 He also knows that the others know this and that they know that he knows this, and so on (1999a: 48).[66]\n\nSecond, principles of justice provide a public standard only if they provide sufficiently determinate and accessible standards of moral permissibility, such that a \u201cperson taking part in an institution knows what the rules demand of him\u201d (Rawls 1999a: 48). This has two components. First, principles pass the test of determinacy only if they are not so vague that they are incapable of producing clear directives.[67] Second, principles pass the test of accessibility not merely when citizens can attain knowledge of how they would be required to act if they were to have the relevant empirical information, but instead only if citizens are in fact able to attain knowledge of that empirical information (Rawls 1996: 182; Lippert-Rasmussen 2008: 41).\nThird, principles of justice provide a public standard only if compliance with their demands is sufficiently verifiable to others. For Rawls, what matters is not only that \u201cthe institutions of the basic structure are just\u201d but also that \u201ceveryone recognizes this\u201d (1996: 66). This test of verifiable compliance therefore requires the possibility of widespread knowledge of the extent to which citizens discharge their duties. This test is most plausibly understood as an aggregative one. For example, the duty not to litter is verifiable to others in virtue of the fact that we can attain knowledge of the extent to which others on aggregate refrain from littering, even though we may not be able to attain knowledge of the extent to which any given citizen refrains from littering.[68]\nRawls appeals to the doctrine of public rules in order to justify several features of his view, including the idea that the principles of justice should govern the distribution of social primary goods rather than the distribution of welfare. Part of what justifies this verdict is that, because it is not feasible accurately to measure welfare, principles that refer to welfare fail the test of accessibility. Accordingly, these principles \u201crun afoul of the [publicity] constraint\u201d, such that \u201cIn political life citizens cannot sensibly apply or follow it\u201d (Rawls 1996: 182 n. 11; Rawls 1999b: 13 n. 3). Because of this, principles of justice that govern the distribution of welfare abrogate their chief purpose, which is \u201cto provide a publicly recognized point of view from which all citizens can examine before one another whether their political and social institutions are just\u201d (Rawls 1996: 9).\nIn the same vein, Andrew Williams writes,\n\n\u2026we have reason to reject conceptions of justice which, given the fact of limited information, are too epistemically demanding to be public and stable. We should, like Rawls, favour conceptions whose scope is restricted to publicly accessible phenomena (1998: 245).\n\nAn implication of the doctrine of public rules, therefore, is that we have reasons to object to highly epistemically demanding principles of justice that fail the tests of determinacy, accessibility, and/or verifiable compliance. As an example of this, let us consider G. A. Cohen\u2019s claim that justice requires citizens to internalize an egalitarian ethos that condemns self-serving behaviour and, subject to a personal prerogative and special labour burdens, requires citizens to be guided by a concern for the least advantaged when making occupational choices (2008: part 1). Rejecting this possibility on the grounds that it violates the doctrine of public rules, Williams writes that\n\nit is quite possible that, in typical cases, we will lack a sufficiently precise public standard by which to justify, or criticize, each other\u2019s self-serving behavior (1998: 240).\n\nThis is because, in order to calculate whether a citizen is acting in accordance with the demands with the egalitarian ethos, we would need to know which occupation available to her best serves the interests of the least advantaged, as well as whether her choice to pursue an alternative occupation would be protected by either her personal prerogative or a concern for special labour burdens.\nThe success of Williams\u2019s reply to Cohen depends partly upon the existence of weighty reasons to endorse the doctrine of public rules. For this reason, we shall now turn our attention to the various arguments in defence of this doctrine. In particular, we highlight three distinct justifications, each of which corresponds to an argument in defence of the doctrine of public reason.\nThe Political Autonomy Argument justifies the doctrine of public rules by appeal to its role in protecting political autonomy (Williams 1998: 244). If citizens have no clear sense of what the principles of justice demand of them, then they lack awareness of the moral constraints to which they are subject, and so are prevented from freely identifying with those constraints. A similar threat to political autonomy arises when principles of justice fail the test of verifiable compliance. If citizens are freely to identify with the constraints to which they are subject, it is important that they can recognise these constraints as a product of others\u2019 compliance with principles of justice.\nThe second justification is the Civic Friendship Argument, according to which we should uphold the doctrine of public rules because of the role it plays in realising civic friendship (Williams 1998: 244). According to this view, civic friendship can exist within a society only when citizens are able justifiably to regard themselves and others (and justifiably be regarded by themselves and others) as doing what is necessary to sustain reasonably fair terms of social cooperation. Publicity facilitates each of these ends. Just as members of an orchestra are denied a common good when they cannot hear, or otherwise appreciate, their own or others\u2019 contributions to their joint performance, so too citizens are denied the good of civic friendship when they are denied awareness of their own or others\u2019 compliance with the principles of justice.\nFinally, the Stability Argument justifies the doctrine of public rules on the grounds that its acceptance enhances \u201cthe long-term probability of a society conforming with its conceptions of justice\u201d (Williams 1998: 244). Again, this instrumental argument relies upon the alleged psychological fact that citizens are more likely to support principles and institutions that they perceive as just (Rawls 1996: 140\u20134). This supports the doctrine of public rules insofar as citizens are more likely to perceive principles and institutions as just when the demands of justice are sufficiently determinate and accessible, and compliance with them is sufficiently verifiable to others (for objections: Caney 1995; Lippert-Rasmussen 2008: 45\u201346).\n3.3 The Good Faith Efforts Objection\nThe most sustained critique of the doctrine of public rules comes from Cohen (2008: ch. 8). Though he advances a number of distinct objections to the doctrine, for reasons of space we shall focus on only one element of his analysis, in which he disputes the claim that principles of justice must pass the tests of determinacy, accessibility, and of verifiable compliance. Cohen denies that, in order to be valid, principles of justice must be capable of serving as a public standard. Instead, he maintains that we can rely solely upon citizens\u2019 good faith efforts. This is the Good Faith Efforts Objection (Casal 2015; Lippert-Rasmussen 2015: ch. 8).\nIn support of this objection, let us consider a gender egalitarian ethos that condemns women having to do more housework than men, for no good reason. As with Cohen\u2019s egalitarian ethos, this ethos may fail to provide a public standard by which to justify and to criticize our own and others\u2019 sexist behaviour. This is because, in order to determine whether a husband who refuses to do the washing up because of backache is acting in accordance with the demands of the gender egalitarian ethos, we would need to know how severe his backache is, as well as to compare the other domestic burdens that he has borne with those that his wife bears. This makes the gender egalitarian ethos highly epistemically demanding, such that it may fail the tests of determinacy, accessibility, and/or verifiable compliance (Cohen 2008: 359\u201360). However, it is intuitively implausible to reject the gender egalitarian ethos on this basis. Rather, in this case, justice requires \u201cgood-faith efforts, not omniscience\u201d (Casal 2015: 822).[69]\nCohen offers a second case in support of the Good Faith Efforts Objection:\n\nDuring World War II in Britain, a social ethos induced people to sacrifice personal interests for the sake of the war effort, and everyone was expected, as a matter of justice, to \u201cdo his bit,\u201d to shoulder his just share. It is absurd to suppose that someone could have stated precisely what amount of sacrifice that injunction required, and it is true, therefore, that, with respect to many people, one couldn\u2019t tell, and with respect to some, they couldn\u2019t even themselves tell, whether they were sacrificing on the required scale (2008: 353).\n\nCohen maintains that, rather than reject such an ethos on the grounds that it is inconsistent with the demands of the doctrine of public rules, we should instead abandon the latter. What matters in these cases, Cohen thinks, is that citizens are able to make \u201ca reasonably efficacious societywide good faith effort\u201d (2008: 352 [emphasis in original]).\nIn reply to this objection, proponents of the doctrine of public rules might circumscribe their claims, holding that we should prefer principles of justice that provide a public standard only under certain conditions. One possibility is to relinquish the doctrine of public rules in those cases in which citizens are required to bear costs that are much smaller than the benefits generated by good faith efforts to comply with those principles. This would explain why the indeterminacy, inaccessibility, and lack of verifiable compliance is not troubling in the two cases we have just considered. In the first, the gender egalitarian ethos requires citizens to bear minimal costs in the fight against sexism; and in the second, Cohen\u2019s sacrifice ethos requires citizens to bear potentially larger costs, but the reward is enormous.\nThis would not amount to an abandonment of the doctrine of public rules. Rather, according to this reply, we should prefer principles of justice that provide a public standard, except when there is not this discrepancy in costs. As the costs that citizens are required to bear increase in comparison with the benefits they are required to generate, it becomes increasingly important that citizens know both what their duties demand of them and the extent to which others discharge their duties.\nTwo reasons support this conviction. First, without determinate and accessible standards of moral permissibility, there is a risk that some citizens will make larger sacrifices than what is morally required of them. When the costs involved are comparatively high, this is likely to be unfair. To illustrate this unfairness, we can consider the case of an individual who internalises the egalitarian ethos, and who takes on some grueling occupation only because she fails to recognise that, because of her personal prerogative, she would be morally justified in pursuing a more enjoyable occupation.\nSecond, it is sometimes reasonable for a citizen who makes considerable sacrifices to have assurance that other citizens are discharging their duties. This is because she knows that she is not being exploited by non-compliers, and because she knows that, if she were not to make such sacrifices, she would be free-riding on benefits that others\u2019 compliance brings (Lister 2020; Mason 2012: 541). Again, these concerns are likely to be more powerful when the sacrifices required of citizens are comparatively high.\nThis reply to the Good Faith Efforts Objection is incomplete in multiple ways. Proponents of this reply must specify the implications of their views in a larger range of cases, including those in which the costs and benefits involved are of comparatively equal values (both high and low). Moreover, it also remains important to explain more precisely how this reply relates to the three justifications for the doctrine of public rules that we considered above. Meeting these challenges is central to establishing the plausibility of the doctrine of public rules.\n4. Conclusion\nWe began our exploration by looking at Kant\u2019s hypothetical publicity test. We asked ourselves whether there were good reasons to believe that hypothetical publicity should be considered a sound requirement to test maxims of action. We also wondered whether hypothetical publicity entailed significant restrictions from the point of view of actual publicity. The answer appears to be rather negative in both cases. This is because, first, there does not seem to be any intrinsic relationship between self-frustratingness and justice. To put things in another way, the less the effect of publicity is contingent, the more we can doubt about its validity as a test of justice. And second, if no criterion is provided as to the level of generality at which the Kantian test should operate, we run both risks of under- and over-exclusiveness. Which maxims of action should be deemed unjust is therefore left rather undefined by the test in most cases.\nWhile it is unclear whether the Kantian hypothetical publicity test could (and should) be rescued, there is no doubt that actual publicity issues raise interesting philosophical challenges. One of them has to do with the articulation between, on the one hand, the function that political philosophy ascribes to voting, representation, and deliberation; and, on the other hand, the types of effects that could be expected from going public. In the course of our discussion, we also tried to draw parallels and to identify differences between voters and their representatives (e.g., through the idea of horizontal accountability) and between the voting and the deliberation debate. The meaning of the publicity requirement may differ significantly as well when we compare standard representative bodies (e.g., parliaments) with the civil service or with \u201cindependent\u201d bodies acting within a democratic context (e.g., central banks or courts). Publicity in the latter case is likely to have both a meaning and consequences quite different from the ones attached to public deliberation, e.g., in a parliament\u2019s plenary session.\nMoreover, while we did not question the possibility of developing principled views in the field of actual publicity, factual assumptions present in most of the key arguments in this respect (e.g., in those of Mill or Elster) require more extensive empirical research. The results that we reported from some of these empirical investigations are potentially rich in consequences for our normative theories. The data gathered by Naurin (2004) and Meade and Stasavage (2008) are especially important in this respect. As is the case with other issues in political philosophy, there is certainly a need here for philosophers to engage in a dialogue with social scientists.\nFinally, we briefly presented Rawls\u2019s uses of the idea of publicity. The variety of ways in which he refers to it certainly shows the need for a more substantial mapping enterprise, at a strictly conceptual level. This could in turn indicate reasons to develop philosophical arguments in new directions.",
