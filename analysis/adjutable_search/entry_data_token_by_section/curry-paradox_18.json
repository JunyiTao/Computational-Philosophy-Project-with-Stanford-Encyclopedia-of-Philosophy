    "main_text": "Validity Curry || Predicate Form\n6.3 Significance\n\nIf, in fact, v-Curry paradoxes aren\u2019t amenable to weakly\ncontraction-free or strongly detachment-free responses, then (assuming the rule Id is retained) the\nspace of Curry-complete responses is restricted to strongly\ncontraction-free and weakly detachment-free responses.\nThe former responses, as explained in\n section 4.2.1,\n are typically presented by reformulating modus ponens (or detachment for the validity predicate) in a substructural deduction system and rejecting the structural contraction rule sCont. The\nlatter responses, as explained in\n section 4.2.2,\n reject the structural principle of transitivity. For this reason,\nv-Curry paradoxes have sometimes been taken to motivate\nsubstructural consequence relations (e.g.,\nBarrio et al. forthcoming; Beall & Murzi\n2013; Ripley 2015a; Shapiro 2011, 2015).[32]\n\nThe lively and wide-ranging debate on v-Curry paradoxes has resulted\nin genuine progress in our understanding of Curry paradoxes. In the\nend, what has become clear is that while v-Curry paradoxes may invite\ndifferent resolutions from non-v-Curry paradoxes, they remain within\nthe same mold as generalized Curry paradoxes. In particular, in the\ngeneral template of\n section 5.2\n one may take \\(\\odot\\) to express (either as a predicate or as a\nconnective) consequence in light of \\(\\vdash_\\mathcal{T}\\) itself.\nThis is the heart of v-Curry. Inasmuch as there are (many) different\n(formal) consequence relations definable over our language (e.g.,\nlogical consequence in virtue of logical vocabulary, epistemic\nconsequence in virtue of logical-plus-epistemic vocabulary, and so on)\nthere are thereby many different v-Curry paradoxes that may arise.\nStill, the space of solutions to these paradoxes is the space of\nsolutions to the generalized Curry paradoxes canvassed in this\nentry.\n\nThere remain, however, at least two reasons v-Curry paradoxes merit\nseparate attention.  First, as noted above, two categories of\nCurry-complete solutions \u2014 the weakly contraction-free and\nstrongly detachment-free options \u2014 have appeared especially\nproblematic in the case of v-Curry paradoxes. Second, suppose that one\ntreats an ordinary Curry paradox (property-theoretic, set-theoretic or\nsemantic) in a Curry-complete fashion. There may still be reason to\ntreat the corresponding (connective or predicate) v-Curry paradox in a\nCurry-incomplete fashion, perhaps in virtue of seeing a theory\u2019s\nconsequence relation as essentially beyond capture by any connective\nor predicate in the language of the theory (see, e.g., Myhill 1975;\nWhittle 2004). Thus, a \u201cnon-uniform\u201d solution to ordinary\nCurry paradoxes and their v-Curry counterparts may \u2014 once\nagain \u2014 be a motivated\nnon-uniformity.[33]\n",
