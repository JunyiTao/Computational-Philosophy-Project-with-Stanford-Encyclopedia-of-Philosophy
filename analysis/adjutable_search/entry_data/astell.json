    "main_text": "\n1. Metaphysics\n\nMary Astell designed her metaphysics around an account of God and\nGod\u2019s creation. She was a dualist, maintaining that the two\nkinds of beings\u2014minds and bodies\u2014come in various degrees\nof finitude and corruptibility: God is the infinite and incorruptible\nmind; human minds and corporeal particles are finite, naturally\nincorruptible beings; and human bodies and physical objects are\nfinite, naturally corruptible beings.\n1.1 God\n\nAccording to Astell, God is the \u201cFirst Intelligence,\u201d the\nbeing whose nature is to be infinite in all perfections. When writing\nabout God\u2019s perfections, Astell often lists wisdom, goodness,\njustice, holiness, intelligence, presence, power, and self-existence.\nIn keeping with rationalist views of the period, Astell maintains that\nthe correct understanding of metaphysics turns on the correct\nunderstanding of God. For this reason, much of her work is dedicated\nto demonstrating not only what God is, but also how a correct\nunderstanding of God can be attained.\n\nHer earliest such account is in A Serious Proposal to the\nLadies, where she demonstrates the existence, perfection, and\nnecessary creative power of God. There she gives an example of the\ncorrect method for attaining knowledge, one similar to those developed\nby Descartes in Discourse on the Method and by Arnauld and\nNicole in Logic or the Art of Thinking (see section 3.2 of\nthis entry). Her proof of God\u2019s existence includes an account of\nsimple and composed ideas; clear and distinct perceptions; obscure and\nconfused perceptions; adequate and inadequate ideas; proofs by\nintuition and proofs by comparison of ideas; God\u2019s perfections\nand our ideas of them; and the relation between ideas and terms\n(Astell SP, 176\u2013182). In Christian Religion, she frames\nother arguments for God\u2019s existence in terms of what we can and\ncannot doubt; God\u2019s perfections and our ideas of them;\ncausality; and the beauty of the created universe (Astell 1705,\n7\u201310 [sections 7\u201310]).\n\nAt times, Astell privileges some of God\u2019s perfections over\nothers: sometimes emphasizing self-existence above all perfections,\nother times focusing no goodness and wisdom over omnipotence. For\nexample, in Christian Religion, when stating her ontological\nargument for God\u2019s existence, she notes that \u201cI find that\nthe notion I have of GOD, contains those and all other perfections.\nAmong which Self-existence is most remarkable, as being the original\nand basis of all the rest\u201d (Astell 1705, 8 [section 7]). This\nclaim is about the order of ideas: her idea of God\u2019s\nself-existence allows her to understand God\u2019s other perfections.\nA few lines later, she makes the analogous claim about the order of\nreality: \u201cAnd Self-existence is such a Perfection as necessarily\nincludes all other perfections\u201d (section 8).\n\nBroad (2002a, 103) presents evidence that Astell privileges\nGod\u2019s wisdom and goodness over his omnipotence. There are two\nways that philosophers of the period thought about God\u2019s\nattributes of wisdom, power, and goodness. Some held\n\u201cintellectualist\u201d theories, according to which God\nexercises his will in accordance with the true nature of things;\nothers held \u201cvoluntarist\u201d theories, according to which God\nexercises his will to create both things and the truth of things. In\nshowing that Astell maintains an intellectualist theology, Broad\nrefers to a number of passages, one of which is the following:\n\nThis is then the sum of the matter; GOD who is Infinite in all\nPerfections, in Justice and Holiness, as well as in Goodness and\nMercy, always does what is best and most becoming His Perfections, and\ncannot act but according to the Essential Nature and Reason of things;\nnor is it possible that our Wishes or Actions shou\u2019d make any\nalteration in the immutable Rectitude of His Conduct. (Astell 1705, 95\n[section 105] see also 416 [section 407]; see also Astell SP, 205)\n\n1.2 Individuation among Beings: Minds, Bodies, and Mind-Body Unions\n\nThroughout her texts, Astell is concerned with giving an account of\nhow created beings are individuated from each other. Ultimately, she\nmaintains that there are four kinds of created beings: minds, bodies,\nmind\u2013body unions, and the particles that compose bodies.\n\nAbout finite minds considered on their own, Astell holds that God\ncreates minds with intrinsic differences. She gives a number of\nreasons for this view. One has to do with the relationships that God\nwants minds to have with each other: humans form community only if\ntheir minds have different intellectual capacities. Another concerns\nthe relationship between created minds and God: minds were made to\ncontemplate and enjoy God, and God needs their adoration and love. But\neach mind is limited and, thus, can only love God by adoring a limited\namount of his works. So God creates many minds, each with an ability\nto understand a specific collection of truths, and in this way all of\nhis creation is attended to (Astell SP, 144\u2013146,\n154\u2013155).\n\nThough Astell discusses minds as if they are sometimes isolated from\nbodies, holding that human beings are mind\u2013body unions, she\nnotes that we cannot comprehend the connection between the mind and\nbody: \u201cWe know and feel the Union between our Soul and Body, but\nwho amongst us sees so clearly, as to find out with Certitude and\nExactness, the secret ties which unite two such different Substances,\nor how they are able to act upon each other?\u201d (148) The union\nbetween the mind and body is mysterious; though we \u201cknow and\nfeel\u201d it, we do not have perfect knowledge of it or of how the\nmind and body interact causally. In Christian Religion,\nAstell presents this same position by way of a parallel between, on\nthe one hand, our lack of knowledge of the mind\u2013body union, and,\non the other hand, our lack of knowledge about the relation between\nGod and humans: \u201cAgain, tho\u2019 I do not understand the\nPhilosophy of the Union between the Divine and Human Nature; (neither\ndo I comprehend the Vital Union between my Soul and Body, nor how and\nin what manner they are joyn\u2019d, tho\u2019 I am sure that so it\nis) \u2026\u201d (Astell 1705, 51 [section 62]). (See section 2.2\nfor an additional discussion of these passages.)\n\nAstell presents an array of points about how mind\u2013body unions\ndiffer from each other with respect to their abilities. At one point,\nshe writes that perhaps activity in this lifetime is the cause:\n\nFor as the Diligent-hand maketh Rich, whil\u2019st the Slothful and\nProdigal come to nothing, so the Use of our Powers improves and\nEncreases them, and the most Observing and Considerate is the Wisest\nPerson: For she lays up in her Mind as in a Store-house, ready to\nproduce on all Occasions, a Clear and Simple Idea of every Object that\nhas at any time presented itself. And perhaps the difference between\none Womans Reason and anothers may consist only in this, that the one\nhas amass\u2019d a greater number of such Ideas than the other, and\ndispos\u2019d them more Orderly in her Understanding so that they are\nat hand, ready to be apply\u2019d to those Complex Ideas whose\nAgreement or Disagreement cannot be found out by the means of some of\n\u2018em. (Astell SP, 175\u2013176)\n\n\nA second possible cause of the variety among human abilities is rooted\nin God\u2019s creation\u2014God makes some minds with larger\n\u201ccapacities\u201d than others: \u201cThe Primary Cause of this\nis that Limitation which all Created Minds are Subject to, which\nLimitation appears more visible in some than in others, \u2026\nbecause some Minds are endow\u2019d by their Creator with a larger\nCapacity than the rest\u2026\u201d (159). This point about capacity\nis discussed in greater detail in section 2.2 below. In brief, Astell\nholds a distinction between \u201cjust\u201d and\n\u201ccapacious\u201d thinking. Whereas she describes just thinking\nas equally distributed among people in that everyone has the same\nability to think in harmonious and well-ordered manners, she describes\n\u201ccapacious\u201d thinking as unevenly distributed among people\nin that some people have more time and training to attain the vast\namounts empirical knowledge that go into this kind of mental\nactivity.\n\nA third possible cause of the variety of human abilities is the one\nfamiliar to rationalist philosophers, namely that bodies impede minds\nfrom having perfect ideas, for \u201cthe Indisposition of the Bodily\nOrgans\u2026 cramps and contracts the Operations of the Mind\u201d\n(159). Also: \u201cFor did we consider what we Are, that Humane\nNature consists in the Union of a Rational Soul with a Mortal Body,\nthat the Body very often Clogs the Mind in its noblest Operations,\nespecially when indulg\u2019d\u201d (210). Here Astell valorizes the\nmind over the body. The following passage illustrates another way\nAstell emphasizes this point:\n\nFor I question not but that we shoul\u2019d be convinc\u2019d that\nthe Body is the Instrument of the Mind and no more, that it is of such\na much Inferiour Nature, and therefore ought to be kept in such a Case\nas to be ready on all occasions to serve the Mind. That the true and\nproper Pleasure of Human Nature consists in the exercise of that\nDominion which the Soul has over the Body, in governing every Passion\nand Motion according to Right Reason, by which we most truly pursue\nthe real good of both, it being a mistake as well of our Duty as our\nHappiness to consider either part of us singly, so as to neglect what\nis due to the other. For if we disregard the Body wholly, we pretend\nto live like Angels whilst we are but Mortals; and if we prefer or\nequal it to the Mind we degenerate into Brutes. (Astell SP,\n210\u20131)\n\n\nWhereas the body has merely an \u201cinstrumental\u201d role with\nrespect to the mind, the mind has \u201cdominion\u201d over the\nbody, and a governing role over the passions. Humans should correctly\nemploy their minds and bodies so that their humanness does not\ndegenerate into brutishness, or so that they do not presumptuously\nconduct their lives as if they were angels.\n\nAstell\u2019s account of the mind\u2013body union allows her to\nargue against the popular view of the period about women, according to\nwhich women do not demonstrate the same kinds of intellectual\nabilities as do men because women are inherently more closely united\nto their bodies than are men. Equipped with the rationalist account of\nthe mind\u2013body union, Astell can show that much of the uniformity\nof women\u2019s inabilities is rooted not in the nature of their\nsouls, but rather arises because of social practices that have\nimproperly directed their attentions. Thus the difference between the\nabilities of women and men should be explained not metaphysically, but\nepistemologically. For this reason, discussion of this issue is left\nto section 3.2 of this entry.\n\nIn addition to developing an account of the mind\u2013body union,\nAstell also maintains that the mind and body are \u201creally\ndistinct.\u201d Here she again sees how this view is useful to people\nin their spiritual growth. When people realize that the mind and body\nare really distinct from each other, they will also realize that the\nmind is immortal. That is, they will realize that it has a\n\u201cfuture state\u201d beyond this \u201cpresent life.\u201d\nWhen they reflect on this future state, they will be prompted to want\na \u201chappy eternity, by knowing and doing the will of our\nmaker.\u201d In this way, God will become more important to them.\n(Astell 1705, CR 246\u2013247 [section 256]).\n\nIn presenting her account of the real distinction between the mind and\nbody in Christian Religion, Astell demonstrates first that\nthe mind is immaterial; then she uses this result to show that it is\nimmortal. Her argument is thus: she maintains that the mind is\nimmaterial in that it has no parts, and so is indivisible; given that\nit is indivisible, it is incorruptible, and therefore immortal (247\n[section 257]). Having ruled out the natural annihilation of minds,\nAstell turns to the question of whether God would supernaturally\nannihilate minds. She argues that he would not, for God does nothing\nin vain, thus he would not create something only to annihilate it\n(248\u2013249 [sections 257\u2013258]).\n\nWithin her discussion about the immortality of minds, Astell contrasts\nminds with bodies, and she also contrasts different kinds of bodies\nwith each other. In doing so, she explains that human bodies and other\nphysical objects have parts, that is, particles that make them up. As\nbeings with parts, human bodies and physical objects are\n\u201cperishable,\u201d corruptible. There are several things to say\nabout these corruptible beings in contrast with the particles that\nmake them up. First, the particles that make up the corruptible beings\nare not themselves corruptible. That is, they do not go in and out of\nbeing as they do not have parts. But the corruptible beings do come in\nand out of being when those particles that make them up change in\ntheir configurations. She writes:\n\nBecause, tho\u2019 this System of Bones, Flesh, and Skin, &.\nwhich I call my body, shall within Threescore Years; and this Wood\nwhich is now upon the Fire, shall in an Hour or two; and all other\nMaterial Beings shall in their proper Seasons be no more; yet not the\nleast Particle doth totally perish. (Astell 1705, 247\u2013248\n[section 257])\n\n\nShe continues to describe the individuality of corruptible beings:\n\nSo that a Being is Mortal and Corruptible, or ceases to Be, when those\nparts of which it consists, and whose particular Composition and\nFigure is that which denominates it this or that\nBeing, and which distinguishes it from all other Beings, are no longer\nthus or United, but ceasing to appear under their first Texture and\nFigure, are therefore very properly said to Be no more. (Astell 1705,\n248 [section 257])\n\n\nNotice here that Astell is talking about how we\n\u201cdenominate\u201d corruptible beings as \u201cthis or\nthat\u201d kind of being. In addition, note that in explaining\nthis denomination, she is not merely talking about objective features\nof objects. Though she mentions \u201cComposition and Figure,\u201d\nwhich seem like objective features, she is writes about how these\n\u201cTextures\u201d appear. These qualifications give\nreason for viewing Astell as holding that a body\u2019s individuality\nis based at least in part on how perceivers regard it and thus warrant\nus to consider Astell as a kind of phenomenalist about the\nindividuation of bodies. This kind of view not entail that perceivers\nare the sources of beings, for it is consistent with the position that\nGod is the ultimate source of all beings, whether they are human\nbeings, pieces of wood, or the small particles that compose these\nmortal beings. Rather, on this view, the existence of each of these\nbeings depends first and foremost on God, even though perceivers may\nplay a role in assigning them some aspects of their individuality.\n\n\nAstell discusses additional related issues that are hotly contested in\nthe period. For example, she offers proof of the real distinction\nbetween the mind and body is based on the claims that the nature of\nthe mind is thought and the nature of the body is extension\n(249\u2013252 [sections 259\u2013261]). (Her view can be compared to\nDescartes\u2019s; see Atherton, 1993.) In addition, she uses her\naccount of the real distinction between the mind and body to show that\nmatter does not think. (Here she likely has in mind Locke\u2019s view\nabout the possibility of thinking matter; see Bryson (1988), Squadrito\n(1987; 1991), Taylor (2001), O\u2019Neill (1998a, 528\u2013529), and\nBroad (2002a, 151\u2013153), who discuss these arguments in\ndetail.)\n1.3 The Relation between God and His Creatures\n\nAccording to Astell, there are several ways in which humans stand in\nrelation to the divine. We may distinguish these by calling them\ncausal, ontological, and ethical relationships. It is significant that\nAstell maintains each one of these, and each has different\nimplications for other aspects of her systematic philosophy. Briefly,\nwhat I\u2019m calling the causal relation between God and humans is\nbased in God\u2019s creation of humans; what I\u2019m calling the\nontological relation is based in how humans are imbued with a particle\nof God; what I\u2019m calling the ethical relation is based in the\nhuman obligation to love God.\n1.3.1 Causal Relationship\n\nThe issue of God\u2019s creation of humans and what this means for\nhumans animates a major thread in Astell\u2019s exchange with Norris\nabout two popular views in England at the time\u2014namely those\noffered by Occasionalists and Cambridge Platonists. Each of these\ndeveloped different solutions to a purported problem with\nDescartes\u2019s ontology. According to Descartes, God created two\ndifferent kinds of substances\u2014mental and corporeal. He held\nthat, on the one hand, these are \u201creally distinct\u201d from\neach other in virtue of their essences, and, on the other hand, these\nare sometimes united together to form mind\u2013body unions. When so\nunited, minds and bodies interact with each other, for instance during\nsensation. The purported problem can now be stated: how can two\nsubstances that have completely different essences\u2014essences that\nrender them \u201creally distinct\u201d substances\u2014interact\nwith each other?\n\nWith an eye toward resolving this problem, the Cambridge Platonists\nretained an account of the interaction between the mind and body, and\nthey also presented a quite different interpretation of the number and\nnature of substances that exist. Henry More, for example, maintained\nthat, in addition to the souls of God and living creatures, there is\nthe \u201cSpirit of Nature,\u201d which is the causal agent that\nallows human minds and bodies to interact.\n\nThe occasionalist philosophers resolved the problem another way: they\nagreed with Descartes that the mind and body are really distinct\nbecause of their quite different natures, but they denied that there\nis any interaction between them. Instead, they maintained that God\norchestrates a harmonious correlation between events of the mind and\nevents of the body, and he is the efficient (and so direct) cause of\nhuman sensations.\n\nThroughout Letters, Norris defends his occasionalism against\nAstell\u2019s critiques, which were based on Cambridge Platonist\nviews about the nature of the mind\u2013body union. In the\nappendix\u2014written after Norris convinced Astell to allow him to\npublish the letters as a volume\u2014Astell presents two final\ncriticisms of Norris\u2019s account. First, occasionalism makes much\nof God\u2019s creation vain: if God is the efficient cause of all of\nour sense perceptions, then his creation of material objects is\nsuperfluous, for they play no direct role in our sense perceptions\n(Astell, Norris 1695, 278\u201380). Second, occasionalism offends\nGod\u2019s majesty, for according to it he repeatedly interferes in\ncreation in order to move bodies and create mental events (Astell,\nNorris 1695, 278). Astell\u2019s own view about the causation of\nsensation involves an account of a \u201csensible congruity\u201d\nbetween features of external bodies and powers of the soul that are\nemployed in sensations. See O\u2019Neill (2007) for a discussion of\nAstell\u2019s views and also for the history of these arguments in\nSt. Thomas\u2019 critiques of medieval Islamic occasionalists. See\nalso Ackworth (1979, 174, 178), Taylor (2001, 511\u20132), Broad\n(2002a, 109) on Astell\u2019s views on sensible congruity.\n1.3.2 Ontological Relationship\n\nAstell holds not only that God creates humans, but that God gives\nhumans a \u201cparticle of divinity\u201d that then exists within\nthe self (Astell SP, 53). (Note that this is the case even though the\nmind is indivisible, as described above in section 1.2.) That is, God\nand humans share some being with each other. Here Astell follows in\nthe tradition of the Cambridge Platonists, maintaining that human\nbeings are \u201cdeiform\u201d in this manner. This point has\nimplications for Astell\u2019s theory of education (described below\nin section 3.1).\n\nNote that it might seem as though the ontological and causal relations\nare the same relations. They are, indeed, both metaphysical\nrelationships. However, there are important differences between these\ntwo relationships. For example, it is possible to hold that humans are\ncaused by God without holding that humans have something of God in\nthem. In such a case, there is a causal relationship, but not an\nontological one. For Astell, though, humans are not just Divinely\ncaused, they are also Divinely imbued. Thus humans are in both causal\nand ontological relationships with God. \n1.3.3 Ethical Relationship\n\nAccording to Astell, in addition to being in causal and ontological\nrelationships with God, they are also in an ethical relationship with\nGod: they are to love God. (Additional ethical and theological\nramifications of Astell\u2019s view about this obligation are\ndiscussed in section 4.3.)\n\nWhy humans should love God and what this love \u201clooks like\u201d\nconstitutes a major thread of discussion between Astell and John\nNorris in Letters Concerning the Love of God. Here Astell\ndebates with Norris about the nature of God\u2019s causality and\nhuman\u2019s subsequent obligation to love God, discussing the pros\nand cons of occasionalist and Cambridge Platonist accounts. (See\nWilson, 2004, for a detailed discussion of this text.) Norris had\nclaimed in Practical Discourses upon Several Divine Subjects\n(1693) that we should love God because he alone is the source of our\nsensation, and so the source of our pleasure, and so the source of our\ngood. Note here Norris holds that the causal relationship humans have\nwith God determines the ethical relationship that humans have to God.\nAstell objects: our reason for loving God should not depend on the\noccasionalist tenet about God\u2019s direct causal role in the\nuniverse. As their discussion continues, they touch on a range of\nissues, including the extent of God\u2019s causal role in creation,\nthe causal powers of physical objects, the workings of human sense\nperception, the mind\u2013body union, and the ways humans can and\nshould love God and his creation.\n\nThough Astell and Norris disagree on the philosophical basis of why\nhumans should love God, they agree on many aspects of their account of\nwhat love is. According to their view, they hold that love is an\nintegral aspect of minds: as bodies have motion so minds have love.\nThey also agree that there are two basic kinds of love and that these\nare differentiated in part with respect to the objects on which the\nlove is focused, whether human or God. They hold that humans are to\noffer each other \u201cbenevolence\u201d and offer God\n\u201cdesire.\u201d Why? First it is useful to understand how these\ntwo forms of love differ: benevolence is a love in which one being\nwishes another well; desire is a love a being has when some other\nbeing is their good and can satisfy their need. \n\nHumans, like any created being, lacks the causal power to ultimately\nsatisfy the metaphysical needs of other created beings. Thus, it does\nnot make sense for them to desire each other. They can, though, wish\neach other well. This kind of love is marked by its disinterestedness\n(that is, the well-wisher does not expect anything to be given in\nresponse) and it is motivated by altruism and charity.\n\nWhereas humans cannot satisfy the metaphysical needs of each other,\nGod can satisfy humans\u2019 needs. Thus God merits human\n\u201cdesire,\u201d which is a love of something insofar as it is\nour good. However, though we properly \u201cdesire\u201d God, we do\nnot properly offer him \u201cbenevolence\u201d: God does not need\nour well-wishing, for God does not lack anything that we could\noffer.\n2. Epistemology\n\nAstell develops three themes common to rationalism: an emphasis of the\nmind over the body; a theory of innate ideas as the origin of\nknowledge; and a methodology that leads the novice from confusion to\nclarity. Section 1 above on metaphysics, addresses Astell\u2019s\nemphasis of the mind over body. This section reconstructs her accounts\nof mind, ideas, knowledge, belief, and method.\n2.1 Mind and Ideas\n\nAstell holds that the mind has two faculties: the understanding and\nthe will. The understanding is the capacity to receive and compare\nideas, and the will is the power of preferring and directing thoughts\nand motions (Astell SP, 205). Each faculty has a proper object: the\nproper object of the understanding is truth, which has \u201cbeing\nfrom Eternity in the Divine Ideas\u201d (137); the proper object of\nthe will is the good, which is God\u2019s will (206). When the\nunderstanding is healthy, it has knowledge (130); when the will is\nhealthy, it is regular\u2014that is, it is guided by the\nunderstanding (205, 209). The task of the understanding is to govern\nthe will by obtaining truth (130). \n\nAstell holds a view according to which there are not merely innate\nideas, but also innate inclinations. She explains that the innate\nideas are \u201crudiments of knowledge\u201d (128) that are\n\u201cinseparable\u201d from the understanding and are the sources\nof our other ideas (Astell SP, 205). In addition, she states that we\nare born with inclinations that are \u201cinseparable\u201d from the\nwill (205). She explains that our innate ideas make us rational\ncreatures. Irrational creatures, on the other hand, act according to\nthe will of God and by mechanism. But equipped with reason, humans are\nvoluntary agents: we choose our actions according to principles in the\nunderstanding, and we determine our wills (128).\n\nAstell provides two accounts of ideas, one general and one strict. In\ndoing so, she presents her views on knowledge and clear and distinct\nperceptions. Here is the general account of ideas, which is broad\nenough to encompass all thinking:\n\nBy Ideas we sometimes understand in general all that which is the\nimmediate Object of the Mind, whatever it Perceives; and in this large\nSense it may take in all Thought, all that we are any ways capable of\nDiscerning: So when we have no Idea of a thing, \u2019tis as much as\nto say we know nothing of the matter. (168)\n\nIn the general sense, ideas\u2014the immediate objects of the\nmind\u2014are required for knowledge insofar as we need to have some\nidea of a thing in order to have knowledge of it in the sense that we\nare familiar with it. But Astell also gives a stricter, more\nrestricted account of the term 'idea' when she is talking about the\nmore philosophical notion of knowledge as that which is clear and\ndistinct:\n\nAgain, it [the word \u2018idea\u2019] is more strictly taken for\nthat which represents to the Mind some object distinct from it,\nwhether Clearly or Confusedly; when this is its import, our Knowledge\nis said to be as Clear as our Ideas are. For that Idea which\nrepresents a thing so Clearly, that by an Attent and Simple View we\nmay discern its Properties and Modifications, at least so far as they\ncan be Known, is never false; for our Certainty and Evidence depends\non it, if we Know not Truly what is thus represented to our Minds we\nknow nothing. (Astell SP, 168)\n\n\nIdeas in the strict sense represent what is distinct from the mind. As\nsuch, ideas must be clear in order for them to afford knowledge. \n\nFor Astell, though ideas can be confused, they are not themselves the\nsources of error. Rather, Astell locates falsity and error in both\njudgments and in language (169, 171). About judgment: she holds that\njudgment involves the comparison of two ideas; error arises when we\nlack an \u201cintermediate idea\u201d (a \u201cmiddle term\u201d)\nin order to make a judgment (146\u20137, 172\u20133) (see section\n2.2 for a discussion of middle terms). It will help us to avoid this\nkind of error in judgment if we properly use our words that are\nassociated with ideas (172). To do this kind of work, we need to first\nexamine ideas about morality and religion, separating the ideas we\napprehend through philosophical reflection from those we have adopted\nby custom, the latter of which are so often not true ideas. For\nexample, Astell stresses that women need to release the false ideas\nthey have about their natures (ideas they gained from their society)\nand come to understand that they have immortal natures based in the\n\u201cparticle of Divinity\u201d that they have within their selves\n(53). Ultimately all reasonings and deductions should begin from ideas\nthat are clear and are \u201cas distinct as the nature of the subject\nwill permit\u201d (169\u201372). (This issue has implications for\nAstell\u2019s ethics, as explained in section 4 below.)\n2.2 Intuition and Authority, Knowledge and Faith\n\nAstell offers her account of knowledge and faith in order to explain\nthat people should become aware of how these two different ways of\napprehending truth are not just different, but rather that there are\nways in which faith is superior to knowledge. Many people hold that\nknowledge should be praised over faith because knowledge cannot be\ndisbelieved, whereas faith can. But Astell resists this view. She\nexplains that there are some aspects of faith that make it even more\npraiseworthy than knowledge, even though what is grasped by faith can\nbe disbelieved. Her account of knowledge is explained first, then her\naccount of faith, then her discussion of the different \u201cmodes of\nunderstanding\u201d that can arise from these when used in\ncombination. We conclude with a practical reason for why Astell finds\nthis discussion so important\u2014it is integral to current\ndiscussions about education and privilege, namely about the education\nof workers of all sexes and women of the gentry. \n\nOne of the first things to note about Astell\u2019s account of\nknowledge is how different it is from the view that is so often held\nby analytic philosophers of the 20th and 21st\ncenturies. According to the latter\u2019s view, knowledge is true,\njustified belief. Astell, however, holds a view of knowledge according\nto which it is marked by its origin, clarity, distinctness, and the\nmeans by which it is affirmed. On her view, the highest form of\nepistemic grasp that we have of truth is via an ability she calls\n\u201cintuition\u201d (146). She writes that intuition yields just a\nfew truths, each of which is self-evident (150). At one point she\ndescribes intuition as an \u201cimmediate View\u201d (Astell SP,\n149). As such, intuition is a capacity that directly apprehends\ntruths; this means that these direct apprehensions are not first\nbeliefs that later are found to be justified. Rather Astellian\nintuitions are themselves self-evident, not needing external\njustification. In the context of this discussion, Astell directly\ncites Descartes\u2019s words from Principles of Philosophy,\nPart I, section 45 (AT VIIIA 21\u20132; CSM I 207):\n\nThat (to use the Words of a Celebrated Author) may be said to be\n\u201cClear which is Present and Manifest to an attentive\nMind;\u201d so as we say we see Objects Clearly, when being present\nto our Eyes they sufficiently Act on \u2019em, and our Eyes are\ndispos\u2019d to regard \u2019em. And that Distinct, which is so\nClear, Particular, and Different from all other things, that it\ncontains not any thing in it self which appears not manifestly to him\nwho considers it as he ought. (Astell SP, 172)\n\nThough Astell uses some of Descartes\u2019s language when describing\nintuitions, she diverges from his views on issues of which ideas are\nclear and distinct, holding that ideas of God and of our own souls are\nclear, but not distinct (173), noting that although we can know some\nof the attributes of these substances, we cannot know their true\nnatures (173). In addition, she explains that we do not have a\ndistinct idea of God because he is infinite, and she notes that there\nare additional reasons for offering this view, though the\n\u201cReasons [are] too long to be mentioned here\u201d (173).\n\nShe does, however, explain that the idea of God is gained by\nintuition, and that according to this intuition we apprehend that\n\u201cGOD is One Simple Essence, Undivided, and Infinite in all\nPerfection\u201d (147). Astell explains that once we have some\nintuitions, we can draw deductions from them and thus attain\nadditional truths that themselves cannot be doubted. Astell uses the\nterm \u2018science\u2019 to describe this kind of knowledge (149).\nAstell does not give an example, but perhaps she has in mind\nDescartes\u2019s deductions of the laws of physics from the clear and\ndistinct perceptions of God and corporeal substance, for example, his\ndeduction of the law of conservation of motion and the law of inertia\n(Principles II, 36 and 37; CSM I 239\u201340; AT VIIIA\n61\u20133).\n\nBut there is another kind of truth that we hold, one apprehended in a\nquite different way from how we apprehend via intuition. This is\nfaith. Truths apprehended by faith are brought to us via authority\nversus intuition. When the authority is Divine (that is, when it is\nbrought by revelation), then we gain \u201cDivine faith\u201d (149).\nOur perceptions of these truths are clear or distinct (149). Astell\nuses the term \u2018opinion\u2019 to describe these apprehensions\nand all the additional truths that are deduced from them. \n\nIn some cases, we apprehend two truths, but we do not have a third\n\u201cmiddle\u201d term to compare them. For example, we apprehend\n(by both intuition and authority) that God is one simple\nessence that is undivided and infinite. In addition, we also apprehend\nby authority that God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (147). How can\nthese both be true? Astell explains that we have no third idea that we\ncould use to compare them. She explains that God did not impart this\nthird idea to us because it would be \u201ctoo dazzling, too bright\nfor Mortality to bear.\u201d Does this mean that it is unreasonable\nto accept these two truths? Not for Astell. She explains that we know\nboth, though we do not know the manner in which both are true\n(148). Though Astell does not give further explanation here of how a\n\u201cmiddle term\u201d would function to help us know the manner in\nwhich they are both true, she likely has in mind something like the\nfollowing: though we can apprehend both a triangle and a straight\nangle, we might be perplexed if someone told us that they were\nequivalent. Our confusion would be relieved once we realized that each\none measured 180 degrees. Thus \u201camount of degrees\u201d is the\nmanner in which the triangle and straight angle are\nequivalent. Similarly, we lack an idea that allows us to square (so to\nspeak) the seemingly opposed truths that God is simple and undivided\nwith the truth that God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Thus we must\nhold the congruity of two truths as a matter of faith. Astell gives\nadditional examples: we know and feel the mind-body union, but we know\nneither the \u201csecret ties\u201d that unite them nor how they\ninteract; we know we have liberty and we know God governs all, but we\ndo not have a middle term to reconcile these (see section 1.2 for a\nrelated discussion of these passages).\n\nWe can now address Astell\u2019s claim that knowledge (science) and\nfaith (opinion) are not merely on a par, but that there are ways in\nwhich faith is superior to knowledge. Note first that the two are\ndifferent in at least two ways: (1) they are the results of different\nabilities\u2014intuition (for knowledge/science) and authority (for\nfaith/opinion); and (2) they have different aspects to them, science\nbeing immutable and opinion being variable (150). However, as Astell\nexplains, these differences do not imply that one is rationally proved\nand thus certain and that the other is not. Rather, Astell emphasizes\nthat they are proved in different ways: \u201cScience Demonstrates\nthings that are Seen, so Faith is the Evidence of such as are Not\nSeen\u201d (150; note that Astell here references Hebrews\n11:1\u20136 from the Christian Bible). We should not expect that\nknowledge and faith work in the same way, as they are the results of\nsuch different capacities; as every sense has its proper object (the\neyes have colors, the ears have sounds, etc.), so every capacity of\nthe understanding has its proper object: science has as its objects\ntruths that can cannot be disbelieved (because of their clarity and/or\ndistinctness), whereas faith has as its objects truths that are not\nmarked by distinctness or clarity, and thus can admit of disbelief\n(151). Thus faith requires a deliberate activity of the will that\nknowledge does not: when we have knowledge, our will is compelled by\nthe clarity of the perception; but when we have faith, our will is not\nso compelled. Given this, faith has a special result that knowledge\nlacks; that is, faith involves an activity of the will that is capable\nof reward (151).\n\nIn addition, Astell explains that we should not claim that science is\nsomehow more certain than faith. In comparison with truths held by\nscience, we can gain as much if not more certainty when we hold a\ntruth via faith if we show (1) that God gave us the truth and (2) God\nis not deceived or a deceiver (151). Indeed, Astell holds that\nrevelation is an improvement on reason (147). \n\nFor Astell, what is most important is that we align our abilities with\ntheir proper objects: we should believe objects of faith, we should\nknow objects of knowledge (152). That is, we should not place faith in\nwhat is an object of science, nor should we adhere \u201cblindly to\nthe Dictates of some famous Philosopher in Physical Truths, the\nPrinciples of which we have as much right to examine, and to make\ndeductions from \u2018em as he had\u201d (152). \n\nThis connects to Astell\u2019s view on wisdom: \u201cto Know what is\nto be Known, and to Believe what is to be Believ\u2019d is the\nproperty of a Wise person\u201d (152). It also provides one of the\ntheoretical bases for Astell\u2019s views on education, which focuses\nin part on how to grasp truths that can be self-evident (see section\n3.2). Astell points out how this distinction between knowledge and\nbelief was playing a role in current controversies about gender,\neducation, and social rank (close to what we today understand as\nsocial class). Some of this discussion centered around issues of\npeople\u2019s free time that could be used for study. Locke, for\nexample, thought that men of the gentry and nobility had the time and\nmeans to gain knowledge, but that everyone else without these\ngendered, financial, and social privileges who lacked this time and/or\nthe means to improve themselves (and their \u201ccapacities\u201d)\ncould make do with belief. Consider what Locke writes in On the\nReasonableness of Christianity: \n\nThe greatest part of mankind want leisure or capacity for\ndemonstration, nor can they carry a train of proofs, which in that way\nthey must always depend upon for conviction, and cannot be required to\nassent to till they see the demonstration. Whenever they stick, the\nteachers are always put upon proof, and must clear the doubt, by a\nthread of coherent deductions from the first principle, how long, or\nhow intricate soever that be. And you may as soon hope to have all the\nday-labourers and tradesmen, the spinsters and dairy-maids, perfect\nmathematicians, as to have them perfect in ethics this way: hearing\nplain commands, is the sure and only course to bring them to obedience\nand practice. The greatest part cannot know, and therefore they must\nbelieve. (Reasonabless of Christianity, section 243 in\nLocke\u2019s Works, vol 7, p. 143, and see also\nReasonableness, section 302; see also Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding 4.20.2\u20133; for a discussion of these\nissues, see Wolterstorff 1996, p. 71 ff.)\n\n\nWith his reference to \u201cday-labourers,\u201d\n\u201ctradesmen,\u201d \u201cspinsters,\u201d and\n\u201cdairy-maids,\u201d Locke is explicitly speaking of people of\nall genders who work with their hands. But the term\n\u2018spinster\u2019 can also refer to the single gentry\nwoman\u2014that is, to someone like Astell herself. Thus\nLocke\u2019s statement lends itself to the following interpretation:\nwhereas people with greater gendered, financial, and social privilege\nshould think for themselves, people who are without such privilege\nshould listen \u201cto plain commands.\u201d That is, they should be\ntold what to think without fully understanding why they should think\nthose things. In other words, they should follow authority, whether\nthat be God\u2019s authority or human authority. \n\nThere are important issues of consent involved here. Consider even on\nthe most charitable reading of Locke\u2019s statement, according to\nwhich he is speaking about wanting to make life easier for people who\ndo not have time and resources to gain education in religious matters\nand thus aim to serve them in their best interests. Who is to prevent\nthe kind of manipulation that can happen when a religious teacher\noversteps their bounds and issues \u201cplain commands\u201d that\nmanipulate people against their best interests? Shouldn\u2019t the\nsocially marginalized people be able to defend themselves against this\nkind of situation by fully understanding for themselves the truths\nthat are in their best interests? \n\nIt is for these kinds of reasons that Astell resists this view. In\ncontrast to Locke\u2019s view, she argues that all people,\nregardless of gender and social station (and thus temporal\nconstraints), have the ability to have clear and distinct ideas that\nare obtained by spiritual practices like the ones of philosophical\nmeditation that she and Descartes each offers. As she puts it,\n\u201cFor the difference between a plow-man and a Doctor does not\nseem to me to consist in this, That the Business of the one is to\nsearch after Knowledge, and that the other has nothing to do with\nit\u201d (Astell SP, 153). Further she writes: \u201cThe Meanest\nPerson shou\u2019d Think as Justly, tho\u2019 not as\nCapaciously, as the greatest Philosopher\u201d (168).\nAccording to Astell, no matter where a person is situated within the\nsocial strata of society and no matter what their gender is, they\nshould be able to have well-ordered thoughts\u2014that is, thoughts\nthat are \u201cjust.\u201d She admits that everyone may not have\ntime to have as many thoughts as someone else\u2014that is,\nthey may not have time to do vast amounts of empirical study, book\nlearning, and language learning as someone else who has more time to\ndedicate to these kinds of endeavors that would give them\n\u201ccapacious\u201d learning. But for Astell, such\ncapacious thinking is not as important as just\nthinking. In addition, the process of attaining just thinking does not\ntake a long amount of time, and everyone should be given the\nopportunity to think in this way. Thus, Astell advocates for\neveryone\u2019s need to have the kind of philosophical meditation\nthat yields well-ordered, harmonious thinking. \n3. Method: Philosophy of Education\n\nOne thread that runs through rationalist philosophies concerns the\nrelation between knowledge and method. Methods are pedagogical\nstrategies that lead novices from confusion to knowledge (clarity). As\nlong as novices are confused, it is because they lack a method that\nleads them from their particular forms of confusion to knowledge. The\njob of the philosopher is to understand the confusions and to devise a\nmethod that will support the novices on their journeys (see Nelson\n2005). For example, Plato explains how the body confuses the soul, and\nhe illustrates how the dialectic can lead his interlocutor to grasp\nthe forms. Descartes agrees with Plato about the body\u2019s\nconfusion of the soul, adding that scholastic teachings lead to\nfurther confusion, especially in that they reinforce childhood\nprejudice, which is rooted in an overemphasis on the senses. His\nfamous method of doubt is one instantiation of his general account of\nmethod, encapsulated in the four rules he presents in Part II of\nDiscourse on the Method (AT VI 18\u20139; CSM I 20). In\nDiscourse on the Method and Meditations on First\nPhilosophy, the meditator utilizes the method of doubt so she can\nmove from confusion and obscurity to clarity and distinctness. This\nissue relates to epistemology (because it is about knowledge, see\nsection 2) and ethics (insofar as confusion and knowledge inform moral\nagency and action, see section 4).\n\nLike Plato and Descartes, Astell provides an explanation of the\nnovice\u2019s initial confusion and offers a method that can be\nemployed to resolve the condition. In doing so, she focuses on the\ntrajectory of a very specific group of female novices, namely the\n\u201cLadies\u201d she names in the title of her text A Serious\nProposal to the Ladies. These are the gentry and noble women of\nher social circle, women who are predominantly English and likely\nidentify as White, which is a new racial category just being\nconstructed during Astell\u2019s century. Thus, Astell is not\ntheorizing the condition of all women, for she is not talking\nabout, for example, the women of various races and national origins\nwhom she and her peers paid, indentured, and/or enslaved to serve\nthem, both at home and abroad (see Perry, 1986, 253\u201362, for a\ndiscussion of the ways in which Astell\u2019s patrons were involved\nin colonialist ventures). In what follows, the women Astell is\ntheorizing are referred to in ways that continue to make it clear that\nthey were a specific group of women\u2014they were, for example,\n\u201cAstell\u2019s novices,\u201d \u201cthe women of\nAstell\u2019s intended audience,\u201d or (simply) the\n\u201cLadies.\u201d\n\nAstell theorizes what is specific about her novice\u2019s initial\nconfusions and she constructs a method tailored specifically for them.\nIn doing so, she theorizes some of the political issues about power\nthat are intertwined with how these epistemic problems arise, and she\nalso theorizes how they can be resolved. Note that Astell theorizes\n\u201csome\u201d of the political issues. On the one hand, she\naddresses how these women are disadvantaged and dominated by men of\ntheir rank and race, as well as by the institutions that support these\nmen. But on the other hand, she does not theorize the ways in which\nthese women themselves\u2014herself included\u2014were advantaged\nand elevated by their gender, sexuality, race, rank, and national\norigin, as well as by the colonial institutions that supported Astell\nand her audience. That is, Astell is theorizing her own and her\naudience\u2019s domination by men, but not these women\u2019s\nprivilege.\n\nAs Astell sees it, the problem that faces her novice is that this\nwoman has a diseased mind as the result of social conditioning in a\nhierarchy that disadvantages her because of (what we today call) her\ngender. This diseased mind manifests in part as a particular skeptical\npredicament: she has a radical doubt about her nature, for she\nbelieves God made her with a degraded reason and a natural pride and\nvanity. That is, she adopts the prejudice that she is incapable of\nimproving because she sees herself as naturally proud and vain (Astell\nSP, 58, 62). Gripped with this skeptical predicament, she has no\ndesire to improve her mind, and she lacks an ability to understand her\nperfections, which would otherwise guide her in living a virtuous life\n(80\u20131, 200, 202, 228). Thus she develops an account of (what has\nbeen called by Sowaal [2007, 2016]) the Women\u2019s Defective\nNature Prejudice, and develops strategies for how to resolve it\n(see sections 3.1 and 3.2). (See Forbes for how this view of prejudice\nconnects with contemporary feminism.)\n\nAnother way Astell frames the problem facing the women of her audience\nis in terms of an account of the passions. She maintains that all\n\u201cRational Natures\u201d have within them both generosity and a\nstriving for perfection (62). Here we assume she is using the term\n\u2018generosity\u2019 in the Cartesian sense. Descartes writes:\n\nThe first consists in his knowing that nothing truly belongs to him\nbut this freedom to dispose his volitions, and that he ought to be\npraised or blamed for no other reason than his using this freedom well\nor badly. The second consists in his feeling within himself a firm and\nconstant resolution to use it well\u2014that is, never to lack the\nwill to undertake and carry out whatever he judges to be best. To do\nthat is to pursue virtue in a perfect manner. (AT 11 445\u20136; CSM\nI 364)\n\n\nFor our purposes, this passage can be glossed in the following manner:\na person has generosity when she realizes that she is merely her will\nand she has the resolution to use it well. For Descartes, generosity\nis both a passion and a virtue. It is the keystone passion in that\nwhen one has it, one does not have vices. This is so because vices\nrest on a misunderstanding of what one is and what one\u2019s goods\nare. (See Sowaal 2017 for a longer discussion of Astell on\ngenerosity.)\n\nAstell explains that because the women of her audience are not\nprovided with effective educations in the knowledge of what things\nexist and what their properties are (that is, an education in\nmetaphysics), they do not develop the knowledge of what they truly are\n(their wills), nor do they develop the resolution to use their wills\nwell. Instead, they focus on creating physical perfection and also on\nthe praises that accompany it. Thus they develop vanity and pride, the\n\u201cfeminine vices\u201d (Astell SP, 62\u201364).\n\nUltimately, Astell has in mind two goals regarding the transformation\nof the women she addresses: one for their \u201ctemporal\u201d\nlifetimes, one for their \u201ceternal\u201d lifetimes, namely their\nsalvation.\n\nFor this lifetime: these women need to gain \u201cempire\u201d over\ntheir selves. Indeed, Astell employs the term \u2018empire\u2019\nmany times in Serious Proposal to mean self-control (56, 58,\n72, 86). Of course, for Astell, this empire is the result of divine\ngrace (not human effort), which may be occasioned when a person\nengages in spiritual practices of surrender. (See Kotva for a\ndiscussion of effort and grace in the early modern period.)\n\nWith respect to salvation: these women need to learn to separate their\nminds from their bodies while on earth. If they do not learn to\nperfect their rational capacities by forming clear and distinct\nperceptions\u2014thereby polishing their innate ideas and ordering\nand employing them correctly\u2014, then they will not be able to\nseparate their minds from their bodies when they die, and their souls\nwill not reach heaven. She writes:\n\nAnd since our Happiness in the next World, depends so far on those\ndispositions which we carry along with us out of this, that without a\nright habitude and temper of mind we are not capable of Felicity; and\nseeing our Beatitude consists in the contemplation of the divine Truth\nand Beauty, as well as in the fruition of his Goodness, can Ignorance\nbe a fit preparative for Heaven? Is\u2019t likely that she whose\nUnderstanding has been busied about nothing but froth and trifles,\nshou\u2019d be capable of delighting her self in noble and sublime\nTruths? (80\u201381)\n\n\nIn this way Astell\u2019s rationalist education remedies a practical\nproblem of the individuation of the body and soul at death by\nsuggesting a path for a specific group of women. This elucidates the\nkind of education Astell promotes: it is not preparation for a career\nas a doctor, lawyer, curate, or scientist; nor is it the precursor to\nwhat we today call a \u201cliberal education.\u201d Instead it is an\neducation that teaches the women of her rank and race how to cultivate\nintellectual enjoyment and perfection, and ultimately generosity and\nvirtue.\n\nAstell recognizes that these women need to employ a method to aid them\nin these practices that will prepare them for grace. These women have\nbeen raised to be idle and to concern themselves with frivolous\nthings. When they seek to better themselves, they do not know how to\ndo so, and so they are quickly discouraged: \u201cthey want [lack]\nthe method of doing it; they know not how to look into their Souls, or\nif they do, they find so many disorders to be rectified, so many wants\nto be supplied, that frightened with the difficulty of the world they\nlay aside the thoughts of undertaking it\u201d (124).\n\nAstell offers two proposals for the education of the women she\ndirectly addresses and seeks to teach. One takes place at a\nwomen\u2019s monastery she calls the Religious Retirement, the other\ncan be done outside such an institution.\n3.1 Method for Inhabitants of a Monastic Community\n\nAstell is keen to offer a method for a person who is living in a\nmonastic-like community to use to gain knowledge. She also explains\nhow and why this method works; in doing so, she employs her account of\nhuman nature and the way that it can degenerate into ignorance.\n\nFor Astell, the issue of knowledge and ignorance is always also an\nissue of health and disease. As stated above, Astell, like the\nCambridge Platonists, holds that the human being is\n\u201cdeiform,\u201d it is divinely imbued with a \u201cparticle of\nDivinity\u201d that exists \u201cwithin\u201d it\u2019s soul\n(Astell SP, 53). (For a discussion of deiform in Cambridge Platonists,\nsee Gill, chapters 1\u20133.) When a person is healthy, this divinity\nwithin expresses itself as a \u201cspark of Piety\u201d (107). But\nwhen people internalize prejudices that they have learned from the\n\u201cTyrant Custom\u201d (67), they do not nurture this particle of\nDivinity, but rather they develop a \u201cspiritual\u201d\n\u201cdisease\u201d (84, 88, 102, 74), a disease which comes with\nmany prejudices. Healing will come to the Ladies who enter the\nReligious Retirement when they learn how to transform every\n\u201cSpot\u201d that has turned into a prejudice that is marring\n\u201cthe beauty of [their] lovely Soul[s]\u201d (87).\n\nIn order to heal, the \u201cLadies\u201d at the Religious Retirement\nwill engage in individual and communal spiritual practices that teach\nthem how to \u201clook into\u201d their own souls (41),\n\u201cinto\u201d each other\u2019s souls (100), and into the\n\u201cSoul\u201d of the \u201chappy Society\u201d itself (87).\nWhen a person practices \u201clooking into\u201d the souls of\noneself, one\u2019s fellow, and one\u2019s community, her body and\nsoul will gather with these additional bodies and souls such that they\nform into \u201cone body, whose Soul is love\u201d (87). When each\nperson in the group does this, then each person\u2019s spark gathers\nwith each other person\u2019s spark. Together, these sparks unite\ninto one, \u201cbreathing forth it self in flames of holy desires\nafter GOD and acts of Benevolence to each other\u201d (87).\n\nAstell maintains that as these Ladies engage in these practices, they\nwill get closer to attaining a perfected spiritual condition that\nconsists in piety, apprehension of truth, generosity, and friendship,\neach of which is needed for these Ladies to engage in their proper\nvocations.\n3.2 Method for People Living Outside a Monastic Community\n\nThough Astell thinks that communal prayer, like that described above,\nis one way of gaining access to the truth, she also recognizes\nadditional methods that will lead a person to metaphysical knowledge.\nIn doing so, she suggests in Serious Proposal to the Ladies,\nPart II, that the women of her audience employ six rules that will aid\nthem in their metaphysical reflections (176\u20139).\n\nRule 1: \u201cAcquaint our selves thoroughly with the State\nof the Question, have a Distinct Notion of our Subject whatever it be,\nand of the Terms we make use of, knowing precisely what it is we drive\nat.\u201d\n\nRule 2: \u201cCut off all needless Ideas and whatever has\nnot a necessary Connexion to the matter under consideration.\u201d\n\nRule 3: \u201cTo conduct our Thoughts by Order, beginning\nwith the most Simple and easie Objects, and ascending by Degrees to\nthe Knowledge of more Compos\u2019d.\u201d\n\nRule 4: \u201cNot to leave out part of our Subject\nunexamin\u2019d.\u201d\n\nRule 5: \u201cAlways keep our Subject Directly in our Eye,\nand Closely pursue it thro all, our Progress.\u201d\n\nRule 6: \u201cTo judge no further than we Perceive, and not\nto take anything for Truth, which we do not evidently Know to be\nso.\u201d\n\nLike many of Astell\u2019s views and distinctions, these rules are\nripe for comparison with Descartes\u2019s, as well as with those\npresented by Arnauld and Nicole. Indeed, these rules are part of\nAstell\u2019s version of Arnauld and Nicole\u2019s Port-Royal\nLogic, which she designs specifically for the women of her\naudience so that they can escape their everyday skepticism; only once\nthey resolve their skeptical predicaments can they begin to embark on\na project of reflection involving philosophical skepticism, as\nDescartes presents it in Discourse on the Method and\nMeditations on First Philosophy (see Sowaal 2007).\n\nThe method encapsulated in these six rules is to be employed when a\nmeditator addresses a particular subject of inquiry. Astell recognizes\nthat even prior to such reflections, the meditator must first\ndisengage from the skeptical predicament that can arise from having\nadopted the social prejudice that they are defective (see section 3).\nInstead of holding beliefs because authorities told them to, and\ninstead of continuing to hold them because they once did, these women\nshould learn to maintain beliefs because they are self-evident. To\nlearn how to reveal self-evident truths, Astell suggests a number of\nstrategies. One strategy involves reflecting on how the former\nprejudices led to mischief, promoted error, and hindered the free\nrange of thought. Another strategy involves reflecting on how the\nprejudices provided a means for skepticism to take root. For example,\nwhen one holds a belief, one often draws further conclusions from it.\nBut when one finds that the conclusion is false, one often questions\nthe whole group of claims, concluding that nothing can be known\n(Astell SP, 133\u20134). Here Astell\u2019s treatment is largely\nCartesian.\n\nHowever, Astell departs from the Cartesian project when she presents\nanother strategy her novice can use to release herself from the\nskeptical predicament. This strategy involves reflecting on\nteleological arguments about the design of God\u2019s creation\n(153\u20134, 168). These arguments are designed to help the novice\nrealize that God would not have created her so that she is naturally\ndefective (that is, naturally proud, vain, and unimprovable). Such\nreflection will lead the novice to search for the perfections God has\nbestowed upon her and the role they play in her life, as well as in\nher community and creation as a whole. Through these considerations,\nshe will be drawn to the conclusion that she is a rational being who\ncan and ought to improve her rationality in order to fulfill\nGod\u2019s plan for creation.\n\nUltimately Astell\u2019s novice will benefit from metaphysical\nreflection on what truly exists\u2014God, mind, and body\u2014for\nsuch reflection will result in her correctly understanding what she is\nand how she stands in relation to God. A central aspect of this will\nbe her new comprehension of the understanding, the will, and the\norigin of error. She will come to grasp that the limitation of the\nunderstanding is not a defect, but rather that limitations are natural\nand necessary; thus, while ignorance cannot be avoided, error can. She\nwill realize that the understanding is passive and that\njudgment\u2014and therefore error\u2014belongs to the will. She will\nlearn to suspend her judgment until she has clarity and to direct her\nwill to a good end (159). With this new understanding of her will and\nher new resolution to develop better habits in employing her will, her\ngenerosity (which formerly degraded into pride, vanity) will be\nrestored, as will her virtue.\n4. Ethics\n\nAstell can also be read as contributing to several different kinds of\nethical frameworks and theories.\n4.1 Ethics as Care of the Self\n\nAstell can be read as part of a long-standing ethical tradition that\nis focused on the self and how it relates to its own moral agency.\nThis has been described recently by Hadot and Foucault as\n\u201cphilosophy as a way of life.\u201d Like philosophers in this\ntradition, Astell focuses on the self and its condition (see sections\n1.3, 3.1), articulates spiritual practices that the self can use to\nfurther its relationship with truth (see sections 3.1, 3.2), offers\nways for the self to critique social customs (see section 2.1), and\nattends to ways the self can continue to grow in freedom from\ndomination (see section 3). In philosophizing in this manner, Astell\nis steeped in Christian theology and the traditions of monasticism.\n(See Webb 2020 for a reading of Astell as a \u201ccare of the\nself\u201d philosopher; see Kendrick 2018 for a reading of Astell as\ninformed by Christian theology.)\n4.2 Virtue Theory\n\nAstell can be read as working within the virtue theory tradition,\nwhich focuses on the character of the moral agent, for she writes\nabout themes like virtue, moral education, moral judgment, character,\nfriendship, and the role of passions in moral action. However, it can\nbe argued that Astell should be considered a virtue\n\u201ctheorist\u201d\u2014and not be considered a virtue\n\u201cethicist\u201d\u2014because she does not hold the tenet that\ngoodness is metaphysically prior to rightness. (See Broad 2016 for a\nreading along these lines.)\n\nWhen discussing the passions, Astell draws on Descartes, explaining\nthat passions arise out of the mind-body union. Like Descartes, she\nholds that we will always have passions, for we are embodied souls.\nGiven that we will always have passions, it is a good practice to\nlearn how to properly direct them and even remedy them, if needed.\nThis task involves properly aligning passions correctly with reason\nsuch that they develop into virtues.\n\nAstell develops her account of the passions by arguing that specific\npassions are not naturally connected with men versus women. That is,\nwomen and men do not necessarily have virtues or vices that align with\n(what we today call) the gender of their bodies. Rather,\nanyone\u2014despite their gender\u2014can have any passion, virtue,\nor vice. This means that even men can develop the so-called\n\u201cfeminine vices.\u201d This point is important to Astell\nbecause of (what can be called) the Women\u2019s Defective Nature\nPrejudice, described above (in section 3), according to which\nAstell\u2019s \u201cLadies\u201d are seen as naturally having\n\u201cfeminine vices\u201d such as imprudence, vanity, and pride.\nAstell shows that such vices are not natural or inherent features of\nthe souls of women. (See Sowaal 2007 and 2016 for a reading along\nthese lines.)\n\nThe passion that is central to Astell\u2019s theory is love. Her\naccount of love draws on neo-Platonic Christian ethics and traditions\nof monasticism (especially practices of communal contemplation,\nmeditation, simplification, and prayer). According to Astell, humans\nhave both an ability and duty to love. Section 1.3 above discussed the\nmetaphysical implications Astell draws from this; here and in the next\nsection, we turn to the ethical and religious implications.\n\nFor Christian philosophers, Astell included, the love of God is\ncentral to theological ethics, for it is one of the two lessons that\nJesus emphasized from his Jewish education and commanded of his\nfollowers: love God and love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:\n36\u201340). Thus the philosopher can ask: what makes it possible for\nus to discharge these duties? That is, how is the world made such that\nwe can love God and love each other? As mentioned above,\nAstell addresses these issues by describing two kinds of\nlove\u2014that of desire and benevolence. We can now say a bit more\nabout her view: for Astell, the human ability to desire\nGod\u2014that is, to stand before God and ask that God complete the\nhuman self\u2014allows for the possibility for humans to offer\nbenevolence to each other\u2014that is, to truly wish each\nother well. These are the grounds for Astell\u2019s account of\nfriendship, which is a theory that allows for universal friendship\nthat does not require either partiality or reciprocity (unlike what is\nrequired for Aristotelian friendship). In writing about friendship,\nAstell is especially interested in giving an account of how women can\nbe \u201cspiritual\u201d friends with each other. Thus she examines\nsame-sex friendship, and she considers women\u2019s social bonds as\nthey exist outside of the family unit. (See Kendrick 2018 for a\nreading along these lines.)\n4.3 Deontological Ethics\n\nGiven that Astell discusses duties to love God and neighbor,\nit is possible to read Astell as part of the deontological tradition.\nThis tradition focuses on moral agents insofar as they have duties\nthey must discharge. Such a reading may develop along the following\nlines.\n\nHumans have duties to God based on their relationship with God: the\nhuman originates in God and God communicates his\nperfections\u2014namely those of freedom and rationality\u2014to the\nhuman; thus humans have the duty to understand and obey God\u2019s\nwill, participate in the divine, contribute to the world\u2019s moral\nperfection, and bring glory to God.\n\nHumans also have duties to themselves and their fellows, namely to\ncultivate their own rational capacities and to help others do the\nsame. This discharge has social ramifications: a human with perfected\nrationality and freedom has the ability to engage properly in\nfriendships and marriages.\n\nIn this way, Astell\u2019s educational plans for the\n\u201cLadies\u201d can help these women develop rationality and\nfreedom such that they can properly discharge their duties to\nthemselves, their fellows, and God.
