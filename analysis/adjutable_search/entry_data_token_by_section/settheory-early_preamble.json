    "main_text": "\n\nSet theory is one of the greatest achievements of modern mathematics.\nBasically all mathematical concepts, methods, and results admit of\nrepresentation within axiomatic set theory. Thus set theory has served\nquite a unique role by systematizing modern mathematics, and\napproaching in a unified form all basic questions about admissible\nmathematical arguments\u2014including the thorny question of\nexistence principles. This entry covers in outline the convoluted\nprocess by which set theory came into being, covering roughly the\nyears 1850 to 1930.\n\nIn 1910, Hilbert wrote that set theory is \n\n\nthat mathematical discipline which today occupies an outstanding role\nin our science, and radiates [ausstr\u00f6mt] its powerful\ninfluence into all branches of mathematics. [Hilbert 1910, 466; \ntranslation by entry author] \n\n\nThis already suggests that, in order to discuss the early history, it\nis necessary to distinguish two aspects of set theory: its role as a\nfundamental language and repository of the basic principles of modern\nmathematics; and its role as an independent branch of mathematics,\nclassified (today) as a branch of mathematical logic. Both aspects are\nconsidered here. \n\nThe first section examines the origins and emergence of set\ntheoretic mathematics around 1870; this is followed by a discussion of\nthe period of expansion and consolidation of the theory up to\n1900. Section 3 provides a look at the critical period in the\ndecades 1897 to 1918, and Section 4 deals with the time from Zermelo to\nG\u00f6del (from theory to metatheory), with special attention to the\noften overlooked, but crucial, descriptive set theory. \n",
