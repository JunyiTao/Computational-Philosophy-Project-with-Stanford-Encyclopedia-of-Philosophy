    "main_text": "Mutual obligations\n5. The discursive dilemma and group minds\n\nIt was suggested earlier (in Section 1) that thinking of a group as\nitself an agent and a subject of intentional states was not a good\nmodel or account of central forms of shared intention and activity.\nBut that\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s never appropriate to talk\nthis way. Indeed, Rovane, Pettit and others have argued that some\ngroups can be genuine subjects of intentional attitudes, and can have\nminds of their own. This would amount to a different way in which\nindividuals can act together, and raises interesting questions about\nhow a group\u2019s intentions must be related to an individual\u2019s in\npractical reasoning.\n\nPettit starts with the assumption that a rational integration of a\ncollective is a sign of its mentality (2003, 181). He says, \n\n\u2026 it is reasonable, even compulsory, to think of the integrated\ncollectivity as an intentional subject\u2026The basis for this claim is\nthat the integrated collectivity, as characterized, is going to\ndisplay all the functional marks of an intentional subject\u2026Within\nrelevant domains it will generally act in a manner that is\nrationalized by independently discernible representations and goals;\nand within relevant domains it will generally form and unform those\nrepresentations in a manner that is rationalized by the evidence that\nwe take to be at its disposal. (Pettit 2003, 182; see also Rovane\n1998, 131\u20132 for a related line of thought.)\n\n\nThe group mind hypothesis thus seems to explain or account for the\nrationality exhibited by the group, both in what it does and what it\nrepresents. This explanatory role, if indispensable, would give us a\nreason for admitting into our ontology groups with genuine minds of\ntheir own. The point might be put in traditional Quinean terms: if a\nregimentation in first order logic of our best empirical theory\nquantifies over such groups, then such groups exist. But this sort of\nexplanatory commitment needn\u2019t be quite as explicitly\nquantificational as Quine would have it, and Pettit himself never\nmentions Quine. The ontological commitment might be more implied in\nthe content of our theory than a matter of logical form.\n\nAnother question to raise, if only to set aside on this occasion, is\nwhether the only sort of indispensability that can support the group\nmind hypothesis is of the theoretical/explanatory sort. One might, for\nexample, consider whether the Rovane/Pettit line of thought could be\nrun with the assumption that the indispensability of such groups is\npractical in nature, perhaps a condition for a sort of agency that\nindividuals can and do exercise (Roth 2014a, 140\u2013141; Pettit\n2015, 1642).\n\nBut is the group mind hypothesis explanatorily indispensable? If the\nrational behavior, representation, speech, etc. can easily be\nexplained (or explained away) without invoking group minds, then the\npresumption of mindedness is defeated. Thus, if we discover of what\nappears to be a subject that its behavior was entirely controlled by\nor explicable in terms of the attitudes and behavior of some other (or\nothers), then one would no longer have reason to think the subject in\nquestion as minded. For example, if the rational behavior of a group\nis explained wholly in terms of the individual members, then we are\nnot tempted to think that the group itself is genuinely minded\n(Watkins 1957). Or, if there is a very tight fit between judgments and\nattitudes of the group on the one hand, and members on the other\n\u2013 for example if ascriptions of attitudes to a group just is a\nsummary of ascriptions to its individual members (Quinton\n1975\u20136) \u2013 then there is no reason to think of the group as\nhaving a mind of its own.\n\nPettit\u2019s recent arguments address this worry. He has suggested\nthat some group decision procedures are such that past group judgments\nrationally constrain subsequent decisions, judgments, and intentions.\nWhen such \u201cpremise-driven\u201d procedures are followed, a\ngroup not only displays a rational unity indicative of mindedness, but\ndoes so in such a way that it might arrive at a judgment that a\nminority\u2014perhaps even none\u2014of the individual members\npersonally hold.\n\nPettit draws on the literature on judgment aggregation (E.g.\nKornhauser and Sager, 1986; List & Pettit, 2002). Here\u2019s a\nversion of the sort of case Pettit has in mind: several colleagues (A,\nB, and C) heading to the APA convention in Chicago have to decide\nwhether to take the El (train) from the airport. An affirmative\njudgment regarding each of the following considerations or\n\u201cpremises\u201d is necessary for the decision/conclusion to get\non board: whether the train is safe enough, whether it\u2019s quick\nenough, and whether it\u2019s scenic enough (e.g. whether it\u2019s\nokay that they\u2019ll miss out on a view of the lake). Let us also\nsuppose, given appropriate background assumptions, that the\nsatisfaction of these conditions amounts to a conclusive reason to\ntake the train. Finally, suppose the group arrives at judgments\nregarding the premises by majority vote as follows: \n\n\n\nSafe enough?\nQuick enough?\nScenic enough?\nGet on board? \n\nA\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo \n\nB\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo \n\nC\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo \n\nGroup\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\u2572No\n\n\n\nIf the group decides on the conclusion by a majority vote on what each\nindividual personally thinks s/he ought to do, it will decide against\ntaking the train (this is the \u201cno\u201d in the upper triangle\nof the lower right box). But this conclusion would be hard to square\nwith the group judgments concerning the three premises of the\nargument. Whereas, if the group adopts the premise driven procedure,\nwhere the conclusion is determined not by a vote but by group\u2019s\nviews regarding the premises, then the group\u2019s conclusion is\nrational (this is the \u201cyes\u201d in the lower triangle of the\nlower right box).\n\nSuch a conclusion, however, is not obviously explicable in terms of\nthe personal conclusions of the members, each of whom concludes the\nopposite. Thus, suppose (as Pettit does) that there are groups that do\nin fact adopt the premise-driven procedure. Then, the rationality of\nthe group\u2019s conclusion suggests that the group has a mind.\nMoreover, the discontinuity between individual and group level\nattitudes concerning the conclusion is such that the presumption of\nmindedness is not defeated. This suggests to Pettit that, at least in\nsome cases, groups can have minds of their own, and be genuine\nintentional subjects.\n\nOne worry with this argument concerns how the premise-driven decision\nprocedure is implemented. If it\u2019s simply implemented by virtue\nof the intentions of each individual to establish and maintain\nrationality at the group level, then there appears to be an\nalternative to the group mind hypothesis. That the group appears to\nhave a mind of its own in examples such as this would then be an\nartifact of the restricted focus of the example, which said nothing\nabout how a policy of rationality at the collective level is\nmaintained. Once we broaden our perspective to recognize that each\nindividual aims to maintain rationality at the collective level,\nit\u2019s no longer clear that there is such a gap or discontinuity\nbetween the intentionality at the level of the individuals and of the\ngroup. Thus, there would be no warrant for talk of group\n minds.[39]\n Of course, this criticism makes strong assumptions about how to\nexplain any rationality that might be exhibited at the group level,\nassumptions that are open to challenge.\n\nFor some, taking seriously the idea that a group has a mind of its own\ninvolves more than an empiricist commitment to the explanation of\nphenomena. That is, a group mind is not merely a convenient posit\nadopted from within the third person perspective of the intentional\nstance for the purposes of explanation and prediction (Dennett 1987).\nA mind has a point of view, and if sufficiently sophisticated, is a\nsubject of commitment and obligation. In developing ideas of Searle\nand Tuomela in a new direction, Schmid (2014) argues that such a group\nmind would require a distinctive form of plural self-awareness on the\npart of each of the members of the group. He suggests that such groups\ndo exist, and explores ways in which plural self-awareness is and is\nnot analogous to the self-awareness each of us as individuals exhibit.\n\n",
