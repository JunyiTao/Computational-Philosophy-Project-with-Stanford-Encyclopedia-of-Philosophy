    "main_text": "Ontology and Metaphysics || Modes of Being\n2.2 Modes of Being\n\n\nMost traditional category systems, such as Aristotle\u2019s, lay out a\nsingle dimension of categories supposed to be mutually exclusive and\nexhaustive. Ingarden, by contrast, develops a multi-dimensional\ncategory scheme by dividing ontology into three parts: formal, material\nand existential ontologies, corresponding to three distinct aspects\nthat may be discerned in any entity (its formal structure, material\nnature, and mode of being respectively). These different formal,\nmaterial and existential aspects of the object, studied by the\ndifferent types of ontology, may thus be used to classify an object in\nany of three interpenetrating dimensions (although not all combinations\namong formal, material and existential modes are possible).\n\n\nThe formal categories are marked by such familiar ontological\ndivisions as those between objects, processes and relations. Following\nHusserl, in addition to these, Ingarden distinguishes material\ncategories, with high-level material kinds including, e.g., works of\nart and real (spatio-temporal) objects. Finally, claiming there is an\nessential ambiguity in the term \u2018exists\u2019, Ingarden also\ngoes on to distinguish different existential categories or \u201cmodes\nof being\u201d \u2014 different ways in which entities may exist, e.g.,\ndependently or independently, in time or not, contingently or\nnecessarily, etc.\n\n\nThe modes of being are defined in terms of different characteristic\ncombinations of \u2018existential moments\u2019. The existential\nmoments mostly concern either an object\u2019s temporal determinations (or\nlack thereof), or the different dependencies it bears (or does not\nbear) to other sorts of object. In investigating the existential moments that characterize a temporal mode of being, Ingarden makes original contributions to work in the ontology and phenomenology of time, arguing that the past and future exist, but in a different mode of being than the present  (for more on Ingarden\u2019s contribution to these debates see Kobiela 2019). In drawing out the different dependencies that an entity can bear on another, Ingarden goes beyond Husserl\u2019s influential work on dependence\nto distinguish four different existential moments of dependence (and\ntheir contrasting moments of independence): Contingency (the dependence\nof a separate entity on another in order to remain in\nexistence); Derivation (the dependence of an entity on another in order\nto come into existence); Inseparateness (the dependence of an\nentity that can only exist if it coexists with something else in a\nsingle whole); and Heteronomy (the dependence of an entity for its\nexistence and entire qualitative endowment on another). In so\ndoing, Ingarden develops one of the richest and most detailed analyses\nof dependence ever offered, providing distinctions in the notion of\ndependence that can clarify many philosophical problems including but\ncertainly not limited to the realism/idealism problem.\n\n\nIngarden\u2019s four highest existential-ontological categories or\n\u2018modes of being\u2019 are: Absolute, Real, Ideal, and Purely\nIntentional. The absolute mode of being could be exhibited only by a\nbeing such as God, which could exist even if nothing else whatsoever\never existed. The ideal mode of being is a timeless mode of existence\nsuitable for platonistically conceived numbers; the real mode of being\nis that of contingent spatio-temporal entities such as the realist\nassumes ordinary rocks and trees to be; while the purely intentional\nmode of being is that occupied by fictional characters and other\nentities which owe their existence and nature to acts of consciousness.\nThus the realism/idealism controversy can be reconfigured as the\ncontroversy over whether the so-called \u2018real world\u2019 has the\nreal or purely intentional mode of being. (For further discussion of the Purely Intentional mode of being and its role in the theory of perception, see Chrudzimski 2015 and Uemura 2019)\n",
