    "main_text": "Boltzmannian Statistical Mechanics (BSM) || The Framework of BSM\n4.1 The Framework of BSM\n\nTo articulate the framework of BSM, we distinguish between\nmicro-states and macro-states; for a discussion of the this framework\nsee, for instance, Albert (2000), Frigg (2008b), Goldstein (2001), and\nSklar (1993). The micro-state of a system at time \\(t\\) is\nthe state \\(x \\in X\\) in which the system is at time \\(t\\). This state\nspecifies the exact mechanical state of every micro-constituent of the\nsystem. As we have seen in the previous section, in the case of a gas\n\\(x\\) specifies the positions and momenta of every molecule in the\ngas. Intuitively, the macro-state \\(M\\) of a system at time\n\\(t\\) specifies the macro-constitution of the system at \\(t\\)\u00a0in\nterms of variables like volume, temperature and other properties\nmeasurable, loosely speaking, at human scales, although, as we will\nsee in\n Section 4.8,\n reference to thermodynamic variables in this context must be taken\nwith a grain of salt. The configurations shown in\n Figure 1\n are macro-states in this sense.\n\nThe core posit of BSM is that macro-states supervene\u00a0on\nmicro-states, meaning that any change in the system\u2019s\nmacro-state must be accompanied by a change in the\nsystem\u2019s micro-state: every micro-state \\(x\\) has exactly one\ncorresponding macro-state \\(M\\). This rules out that, say, the\npressure of a gas can change while the positions and momenta each of\nits molecules remain the same (see entry on\n supervenience).\n Let \\(M(x)\\) be the unique macro-state that corresponds to microstate\n\\(x\\). The correspondence between micro-states and macro-states\ntypically is not one-to-one and macro-states are multiply realisable.\nIf, for instance, we swap the positions and momenta of two molecules,\nthe gas\u2019 macro-state does not change. It is therefore natural to\ngroup together all micro-states \\(x\\), that correspond to the same\nmacro-state \\(M\\): \n\\[X_{M} = \\{ x \\in X \\text{ such that } M(x) = M\\}.\\]\n\n\n\\(X_{M}\\) is the macro-region of \\(M\\).\n\nNow consider a complete set of macro-states (i.e., a set that contains\nevery macro-state that the system can be in), and assume that there\nare exactly \\(m\\) such states. This complete set is \\(\\{\nM_{1},\\ldots,M_{m}\\}\\). It is then the case that the corresponding set\nof macro-regions, \\(\\{ X_{M_{1}},\\ldots,X_{M_{m}}\\}\\), forms a\npartition of \\(X\\), meaning that the elements of the set do not\noverlap and jointly cover \\(X\\). This is illustrated in\n Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe figure also indicates that if the system under study is a gas,\nthen the macro-states correspond to different states of the gas we\nhave seen in\n Section 1.\n Specifically, one of the macro-states corresponds to the initial\nstate of the gas, and another one corresponds to its final equilibrium\nstate.\n\nThis raises two fundamental questions that occupy centre stage in\ndiscussions about BSM. First, what are macro-states and how is the\nequilibrium state identified? That is, where do we get the set\n\\(\\{M_{1},\\ldots,M_{m}\\}\\) from and how do we single out one member of\nthe set as the equilibrium macro-state? Second, as already illustrated\nin\n Figure 3,\n an approach to equilibrium takes place if the time evolution of the\nsystem is such that a micro-state \\(x\\) in a non-equilibrium\nmacro-region evolves such that \\(\\phi_{t}(x)\\) lies in the equilibrium\nmacro-region at a later point in time. Ideally one would want this to\nhappen for all \\(x\\) in any non-equilibrium macro-region, because this\nwould mean that all non-equilibrium states would eventually approach\nequilibrium. The question now is whether this is indeed the case, and,\nif not, what \u201cportion\u201d of states evolves differently.\n\nBefore turning to these questions, let us introduce the Boltzmann\nentropy \\(S_{B}\\), which is a property of a macro-state defined\nthrough the measure of the macro-states\u2019 macro-region:\n\n\\[S_{B}(M_{i}) = k\\log{\\lbrack\\mu(X_{M_{i}}})\\rbrack\\]\n\n\nfor all \\(i = 1,\\ldots, m\\), where \\(k\\) is the so-called Boltzmann\nconstant. Since the logarithm is a monotonic function, the larger the\nmeasure \\(\\mu\\) of a macro-region, the larger the entropy of the\ncorresponding macro-state.\n\nThis framework is the backbone of positions that self-identify as\n\u201cBoltzmannian\u201d. Differences appear in how the elements of\nthis framework are articulated and in how difficulties are\nresolved.\n",
