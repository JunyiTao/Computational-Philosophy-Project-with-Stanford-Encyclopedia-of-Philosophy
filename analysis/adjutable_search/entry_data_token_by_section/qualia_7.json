    "main_text": "Qualia as Intrinsic, Nonrepresentational Properties\n8. Qualia as Intrinsic, Nonrepresentational Properties of Experiences\n\nAs noted in section 1, the term \u2018qualia\u2019 is sometimes used\nfor intrinsic nonrepresentational, consciously accessible properties\nof experience. Representationalists deny that there are qualia in this\nsense, while identifying qualia in the broad sense (that is, qualia as\nphenomenal character) with representational properties. However, some\nphilosophers hold that there are qualia in the sense of intrinsic\nnonrepresentational properties of experience. These philosophers deny\nrepresentationalism, and identify qualia in the broad sense with\nintrinsic nonrepresentational properties of experience. This view is\nthe subject of the present section.\n\nAs noted earlier, some philosophers deny that experience is\ntransparent. They claim that introspection does not show that\nexperiences lack introspectible, intrinsic, nonrepresentational\nproperties. Further, they insist that representationalism encounters\ndecisive objections. These objections may be seen as making up one\npillar in the main foundation for the view that experiences have\nqualia, conceived of now as intrinsic, nonrepresentational properties.\nThe second pillar consists in what is sometimes called \u201cthe\ncommon kind assumption\u201d, namely that veridical and hallucinatory\nexperiences sometimes share the same phenomenal character (have the\nsame qualia). This assumption is accepted by all the advocates of the\nviews discussed so far but it is denied by advocates of relational\ntheories of qualia (see section 9).\n\nObjections to representational views of qualia often take the form of\nputative counter-examples. One class of these consists of cases in\nwhich, it is claimed, experiences have the same representational\ncontent but different phenomenal character. Christopher Peacocke\nadduces examples of this sort in his 1983. According to some (e.g.,\nBlock 1990, Shoemaker forthcoming), the Inverted Spectrum also\nsupplies an example that falls into this category. Another class is\nmade up of problem cases in which allegedly experiences have different\nrepresentational contents (of the relevant sort) but the same\nphenomenal character. Ned Block\u2019s Inverted Earth example (1990)\nis of this type. The latter cases only threaten strong\nrepresentationalism, the former are intended to refute\nrepresentationalism in both its strong and weaker forms.\nCounter-examples are also sometimes given in which supposedly\nexperience of one sort or another is present but in which there is no\nstate with representational content. Swampman (Davidson 1986) \u2014\nthe molecule by molecule replica of one of us, formed accidentally by\nthe chemical reaction that occurs in a swamp when a partially\nsubmerged log is hit by lightning \u2014 is one such counter-example,\naccording to some philosophers. But there are more mundane cases.\nConsider the exogenous feeling of depression. That, it may seem, has\nno representational content. Likewise, the exogenous feeling of\nelation. Yet these experiences certainly differ phenomenally.\n\nThere isn\u2019t space to go through all these objections. We briefly\ndiscuss just one: Inverted Earth. Inverted Earth is an imaginary\nplanet, on which things have complementary colors to the colors of\ntheir counterparts on Earth. The sky is yellow, grass is red, ripe\ntomatoes are green, and so on. The inhabitants of Inverted Earth\nundergo psychological attitudes and experiences with inverted\nintentional contents relative to those of people on Earth. They think\nthat the sky is yellow, see that grass is red, etc. However, they call\nthe sky \u2018blue\u2019, grass \u2018green\u2019, ripe tomatoes\n\u2018red\u2019, etc. just as we do. Indeed, in all respects\nconsistent with the alterations just described, Inverted Earth is as\nmuch like Earth as possible.\n\nIn Block\u2019s original version of the tale, mad scientists insert\ncolor-inverting lenses in your eyes and take you to Inverted Earth,\nwhere you are substituted for your Inverted Earth twin or\ndoppelganger. Upon awakening, you are aware of no difference, since\nthe inverting lenses neutralize the inverted colors. You think that\nyou are still where you were before. What it is like for you when you\nsee the sky or anything else is just what it was like on earth. But\nafter enough time has passed, after you have become sufficiently\nembedded in the language and physical environment of Inverted Earth,\nyour intentional contents will come to match those of the other\ninhabitants. You will come to believe that the sky is yellow, for\nexample, just as they do. Similarly, you will come to have a visual\nexperience that represents the sky as yellow. For the experiential\nstate you now undergo, as you view the sky, is the one that, in you,\nnow normally tracks yellow things. So, the later you will come to be\nsubject to inner states that are intentionally inverted relative to\nthe inner states of the earlier you, while the phenomenal aspects of\nyour experiences will remain unchanged. \n\nPerhaps the simplest reply that can be made with respect to this\nobjection is to deny that there really is any change in normal\ntracking with respect to color, at least as far as your experiences\ngo. \u201cNormal\u201d, after all, has both teleological and\nnonteleological senses. If what an experience normally tracks is what\nnature designed it to track, what it has as its biological purpose to\ntrack, then shifting environments from Earth to Inverted Earth will\nmake no difference to normal tracking and hence no difference to the\nrepresentational contents of your experiences. The sensory state that\nnature designed in your species to track blue in the setting in which\nyour species evolved will continue to do just that even if through\ntime, on Inverted Earth, in that alien environment, it is usually\ncaused in you by looking at yellow things.\n\nThe suggestion that tracking is teleological in character, at least\nfor the case of basic experiences, goes naturally with the plausible\nview that states like feeling pain or having a visual sensation of red\nare phylogenetically fixed (Dretske 1995). However, it encounters\nserious difficulties with respect to the Swampman case mentioned\nabove. On a cladistic conception of species, Swampman is not human.\nIndeed, lacking any evolutionary history, he belongs to no species at\nall. His inner states play no teleological role. Nature did not design\nany of them to do anything. So, if phenomenal character is a certain\nsort of teleo-representational content, as some representationalists\nhold, then Swampman has no experiences and no qualia. This, for many\nphilosophers, is very difficult to believe.\n\nThere are alternative replies available (see Lycan 1996, Tye 2000) in\nconnection with the Inverted Earth problem. These involve either\ndenying that qualia do remain constant with the switch to Inverted\nEarth or arguing that a non-teleological account of sensory content\nmay be elaborated, under which qualia stay the same.\n\nAs noted above, the second pillar in the foundation of the view that\nqualia are intrinsic, nonrepresentational properties of experiences is\nthe common kind assumption. Those philosophers who accept this\nassumption see it (in the perceptual case) as providing the simplest,\nbest explanation of the fact that hallucinations and veridical\nperceptions sometimes seem exactly alike to their subjects. It is\ngranted, of course, that it does not follow that there is something\ncommon between hallucinations and perceptions in such cases from the\nfact that they seem alike. Nonetheless, it is a challenge to those who\nreject this assumption (see section 9) to provide a better\nexplanation.\n",
