    "main_text": "\n\n\nGiven the extreme importance that Wittgenstein attached to the\naesthetic dimension of life, it is in one sense surprising that he\nwrote so little on the subject. It is true that we have the notes\nassembled from his lectures on aesthetics given to a small group of\nstudents in private rooms in Cambridge in the summer of 1938\n(Wittgenstein 1966) and we have G. E. Moore's record of some of\nWittgenstein's lectures in the period 1930\u201333 (Moore 1972).  Of\nWittgenstein's own writings, we find remarks on literature, poetry,\narchitecture, the visual arts, and especially music and the philosophy\nof culture more broadly scattered throughout his writings on the\nphilosophies of language, mind, mathematics, and philosophical method,\nas well as in his more personal notebooks; a number of these are\ncollected in Culture and Value (Wittgenstein 1980).  In\nanother sense, it is not surprising at all, precisely because\nof the central position he gave to the aesthetic: in writing about\nquestions of meaning, as he did throughout his life from the earliest\npre-Tractatus (Wittgenstein 1961, 1971) writings to the\nremarks from the last weeks of his life in On Certainty\n(Wittgenstein 1969), in writing about perception, as he did in Part II\nof Philosophical Investigations (Wittgenstein 1958),\nRemarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, Volumes I and II\n(Wittgenstein 1980a, 1980b), and Last Writings on the Philosophy\nof Psychology, volume I (Wittgenstein 1982), and in writing about\nthe contextual prerequisites to the emergence of sense in his\nphilosophy of mind and language (in (Wittgenstein 1958) as well as his\nwritings on the philosophy of mathematics), he was writing\u2014if at\none remove\u2014about aesthetics. For questions of meaning, of\nperception, and of sense are all clearly central to aesthetic\nexperience, and the writing he undertook on these subjects holds\nsignificance for questions of artistic meaning and interpretation that\nis still being explored and articulated (Lewis 2004, Dauber and Jost\n2003, Gibson and Huemer 2004).  Wittgenstein placed the aesthetic, not\non a distant periphery of philosophical subjects, but then not at the\ncenter of a grouping of such interests either\u2014for then it would\nstill be a subject area unto itself. Rather, Wittgenstein interweaves\nthe subject's various and variegated strands throughout his writing in\na way that in some cases shows explicitly, and in many more cases\nsuggests implicitly, the layered interconnections between aesthetic\nconsiderations and every other area of philosophy upon which he\nwrote. In this article I will, then, look at the record we have of his\nlectures on the topic (which, predictably, take up many connections to\nextra-aesthetic issues along the way), but throughout try to offer a\nreading of them that situates them into the larger context of his\nphilosophical work.\n",
