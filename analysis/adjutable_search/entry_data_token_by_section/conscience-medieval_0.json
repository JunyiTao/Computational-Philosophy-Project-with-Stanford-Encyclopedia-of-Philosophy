    "main_text": "Background: The Pagan and Early-Christian Context || The Ancient Context: Judicial Conscience\n1.1 The Ancient Context: Judicial Conscience\n\nTo understand the medieval theory of conscience, it is essential to\nexamine its etymology. Unlike most philosophical categories that are\ncentral to medieval thought, the concept of conscience did not have\nits origins in Plato or Aristotle (Potts 1982: 687). Rather, most\nscholars agree, it originated in the Greek playwrights of the fifth\ncentury BCE (Sorabji 2014: 12, 15\u201318). It is also possible to\nfind its use elsewhere in Greek literature, such as in the fragments\nof Democritus (D\u2019Arcy 1961: 5).\n\nThe English word \u201cconscience\u201d is derived from the Latin\nconscientia. Its Greek equivalent is syneidesis.\nBoth terms connote a state or act of \u201csharing knowledge with\noneself\u201d (Sorabji 2014: 12). This knowledge is privileged and\ninvolves awareness of a personal moral defect. The notion that\n\u201cI\u201d can judge \u201cmyself\u201d naturally suggests, as\nSorabji puts it, a sort of \u201csplit personality\u201d. That is,\nit suggests that I can at once be both the judge and the one being\njudged, particularly with respect to specific, past actions which\nordinarily elicit remorse. This suggestion is rooted in the quite\nintuitive idea that human beings are reflexive animals: beings who are\nnot only capable of turning their attention to objects in the outside\nworld but can also \u201cturn back on\u201d (reflectere) or\nbecome an object to themselves. As C. S. Lewis put it in his study of\nthe concept of concept of conscience in the Western tradition:\n\n\nMan might be defined as a reflexive animal. A person cannot help\nthinking and speaking of himself as, and even feeling himself to be\n(for certain purposes), two people, one of whom can act upon and\nobserve the other. Thus, he pities, loves, admires, hates, despises,\nrebukes, comforts, examines, masters or is mastered by,\n\u201chimself\u201d [\u2026] He is privy to his own acts, is his\nown conscius or accomplice. And of course, this shadowy inner\naccomplice has all the same properties as an external one; he too is a\nwitness against you, a potential blackmailer, one who inflicts shame\nand fear. (Lewis 1960: 187; see also Sorabji 2014: 12)\n\n\nLewis refers to this primarily pagan understanding of conscience as an\n\u201cinner witness\u201d. It does not judge our actions as right or\nwrong, but merely testifies to their existence:\n\n\nIt bears witness to the facts, say, that we committed a murder. It\ndoes not tell us that murder is wrong; we are supposed to know that in\nsome other way. (Lewis 1960: 190)\n\n\nOthers, however, regard the sort of conscience that Lewis describes\nhere as a type of internal judge, and therefore refer to it as\n\u201cjudicial conscience\u201d (D\u2019Arcy 1961: 8). While this\nproperty of the mind does not necessarily issue binding rules, it does\npass moral judgements on our deeds. It would, however, eventually take\non the role of issuing moral dictates for future acts as well. Eric\nD\u2019Arcy refers to this later form of syneidesis or\nconscientia as the \u201clegislative conscience\u201d whose\ninnovator, he argues, was the Apostle Paul (ca. 5 CE\u2013ca. 64/67\nCE), the most important founder of the Christian faith after Jesus of\nNazareth (D\u2019Arcy 1961: 8).\n",
