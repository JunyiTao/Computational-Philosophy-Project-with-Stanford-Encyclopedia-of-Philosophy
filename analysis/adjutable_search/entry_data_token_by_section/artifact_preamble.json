    "main_text": "\n\nThe contemporary world is pervasively artifactual. Even our most\nmundane, biologically based activities, such as eating, sleeping, and\nsex, depend on engagement with artifacts. Moreover, many of the plants\nand animals we encounter on a daily basis qualify as biological\nartifacts (Sperber 2007). But unlike language\u2014which also\npervades human life from top to bottom\u2014artifacts as such are not\nthe subject matter of any well-defined area of philosophical research.\nThis is as much the case today as it has been throughout the history\nof Western philosophy (Dipert 1993).\n\nPhilosophy of technology might have played this role, but historically\nit has not done so. Although its roots reach back to the\n19th century, philosophy of technology became a widely\nrecognized specialization only in the second half of the\n20th century. This early phase was dominated by so-called\n\u201chumanities philosophy of technology\u201d (Mitcham 1994).\nHeavily influenced by Martin Heidegger\u2019s (1954 [1977]) seminal\nessay, \u201cThe Question Concerning Technology\u201d, this strain\nof philosophy of technology focuses primarily on the cultural and\nsocial effects of industrial and post-industrial technologies. In the\nlast few decades, a companion strain of philosophy of technology,\nvariously denominated \u201canalytic\u201d (Franssen, Lokhorst,\n& van de Poel 2018) or \u201cengineering\u201d (Mitcham 1994)\nphilosophy of technology has come to prominence. It is focused on\nthe genesis of technologies in the practices of modern science and\nengineering. Thus the net effect has been to focus philosophy of\ntechnology almost exclusively on modern and emerging technologies,\nrather than on artifacts in general.\n\nThe aim of this article, then, is to bring together discussions of\nartifacts occurring in sometimes far-flung areas of philosophy, as\nwell as related discussions in other disciplines. Section 1 concerns\nquestions of definition. Section 2 focuses on the metaphysics of\nartifacts. Section 3 turns to epistemological issues. There are also\nimportant normative issues concerning artifacts, but these are covered\nin other articles in this Encyclopedia, listed in the Related Entries\nsection below.\n",
