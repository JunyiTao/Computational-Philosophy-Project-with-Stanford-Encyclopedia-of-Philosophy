    "main_text": "Principal Varieties in More Detail || Norm-expressivism and Plan-expressivism\n2.5 Norm-expressivism and Plan-expressivism\n\nGibbard\u2019s Wise Choices, Apt Feelings (1990) proposes an\nanalysis of judgments regarding rationality according to which they\nexpress a non-cognitive attitude of acceptance towards rules or norms.\nFrom there he proceeds to reduce other normative judgments into\nvarious more particular kinds of judgments of rationality, so that all\nmoral judgments are covered by the proposed analysis. Gibbard suggests\nthat normative judgments express the acceptance of systems of norms\n\u2013 rules dividing actions under naturalistic descriptions into\nthose which are forbidden, permitted and required. To call an action\nrational is, to a first approximation, to express one\u2019s\nacceptance of a system of norms which allows it. To call an action\nirrational is to express one\u2019s acceptance of a system of norms\nwhich forbids it. And so on (Gibbard 1990, 46). This is only\nGibbard\u2019s idea to a first approximation, since a speaker may not\nhave a determinate system of norms in mind when he or she makes such a\njudgment. So Gibbard suggests we would do better to think of judgments\nto the effect that an action would be irrational as expressing\nrejection of any set of norms which does not forbid it. More\nprecisely, a normative judgment predicating a normative term of a\nparticular action rules out combinations of descriptive judgments\nconcerning the action with norms that either permit, forbid, or\nrequire (as appropriate) actions falling under those descriptions.\nMore complex judgments are captured using the sets of norm-world pairs\nwhich those judgments \u201crule out\u201d to represent the states\nof mind inconsistent with the judgments in question. The basic idea\ncan be illustrated with an example. A judgment that action A\nis permissible is incompatible with a pair the first member of which\nrepresents A as a lie, and the second member of which is a\nnorm that rules out lying. And it is inconsistent with many more such\ncombinations besides. Given this, we can capture the content of the\njudgment that action A is permissible by specifying the set\nof world-norm pairs with which it is incompatible. (A more detailed\nexposition of Gibbard\u2019s technical apparatus can be found within\nthe discussion of the Embedding Problem below and in the supplementary\ndocument\n Embedding Problem Response Strategies.)\n\nGibbard develops his analysis to cover moral judgments by analyzing\nsuch judgments in terms of judgments of rationality. An action is\nwrong if and only if it fails to meet standards of action the\nintentional or negligent violation of which in a normal state of mind\nwould be sufficient for finding the agent prima facie blameworthy. And\nan action is blameworthy if it would be rational for the agent to feel\nguilty and for others to resent the agent for doing the action\n(Gibbard 1990, 45). Since the rationality of guilt or resentment\nreceives a non-cognitive analysis, the approach generates a\nnon-cognitive analysis of moral judgments themselves.\n\nGibbard\u2019s more recent work (Gibbard 2003) retains many of the\nmain features of his norm-expressivist theory but it revises to some\nextent the account of the non-cognitive attitudes involved in\naccepting a normative judgment. On the current view, such judgments\nexpress the acceptance of plans, or perhaps better they express a\nstate of mind that we might think of as planning to act in this way or\nthat depending on the naturalistic circumstances one finds oneself in.\nMore complex judgments embedding normative terms express combinations\nof such attitudes with further attitudes, including ordinary beliefs.\nWhereas in the earlier work Gibbard used sets of world-norm pairs to\nformally capture the contents of judgments, in the later work he\nrelies on what he calls \u201cfact-prac worlds\u201d. Formally they\nfunction in much the same way as the world-norm pairs did in the\nearlier theory. But with the fact-prac worlds apparatus contingency\nplans take the place of norms as members of the pairs. Once again,\njudgements will rule out other judgements represented by a set of\npairs. The judgment that action A is permissible will be\ninconsistent with various combinations of factual beliefs with plans.\nEach of these combinations can be captured by a world representing a\nway the world might be together with a second component consisting of\na plan, representing a commitment to act that the thinker might have.\nFor example the judgment that action A is permissible will be\nincompatible with any pair the fact-representing member of which\nrepresents action A as a lie, paired with a plan that rules\nout lying. And just as a similar idea allowed Gibbard to use sets of\nnorm-world pairs to capture the content of normative judgments, he now\ncan capture the content of a normative judgment by specifying the set\nof fact-prac worlds with which it is incompatible. When the apparatus\nis fully developed, the fact representing members of the pairs can\nonce again be thought of as possible worlds insofar as they specify\nevery detail of the world, and the plans are hyper-plans insofar as\nthey have an answer for what to do in every circumstance. Gibbard\noften calls these fully determinate fact-prac worlds \u201cfact-plan\nworlds\u201d, just as you might expect given what they are composed\nof. The resulting theory might now be called\n\u2018plan-expressivism\u2019 rather than\n\u2018norm-expressivism\u2019 though most of its important\nstructural features are very similar to those of his earlier norm\nexpressivist view.\n\nFurther developments come in the form of Gibbard\u2019s arguments for\nthe resulting theory: Gibbard suggests that people need to plan and\nneed ways to think about and represent their plans. He argues that\nthey would also need to think about what to do from the perspectives\nof various other people and to formulate plans for arbitrary\nsituations they might find themselves in. If these claims are right, a\nlanguage might naturally develop in order to make such thinking\neasier. A planning language modeled by the sets of world-plan pairs\nwould serve very well. And in actual use it would operate much as our\nactual normative language does. It is therefore reasonable to conclude\nthat our actual normative language is of this sort. Furthermore\nconceiving of these attitudes as involving contingency plans for\ndescriptively specifiable circumstances would allow us to explain the\nsupervenience of the moral on the descriptive. The thoughts\nrepresented by the fact-prac world apparatus represent such\ncontingency plans. So the supervenience of the normative on the\ndescriptive falls naturally out of the resulting story (Gibbard\n2003).\n\nSome theorists are unsatisfied with Gibbard\u2019s treatment of third\npersonal judgements, partly because they find the psychology of\nforming a contingency plan for being in another person\u2019s shoes\nimplausible. Ayers (2022) suggests that this aspect of Gibbard\u2019s\nview can be replaced with a third-personal decision that the agent who\nshould act in a particular way act in precisely that way. The view\ntakes on board a commitment to the view that one can decide for others\nin the relevant way. Ayers argues that idea makes sense if one takes\nup certain ideas from the literature on group agency.\n",
