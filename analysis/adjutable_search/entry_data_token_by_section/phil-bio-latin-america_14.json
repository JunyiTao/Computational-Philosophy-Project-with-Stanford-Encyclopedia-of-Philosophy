    "main_text": "Philosophy and History of Biology || Diachronic Philosophical Analyses\n5.2 Diachronic Philosophical Analyses\n\nAs far as diachronic philosophical analyses are concerned, Mercedes\nO\u2019Lery (2016) carries out a Kuhnian examination of the\ncontroversy generated around Rebeca Gerschman and Denham Harman\nregarding the priority of the free radical hypothesis in living\nsystems. She shows that this \u201cempirical novelty\u201d demanded\na change of the paradigm/disciplinary-matrix for chemical reactions.\nThis would later be articulated in the Leonor Michaelis\u2019s work\non partial reduction of molecular oxygen. On the other hand,\nC\u00e9sar Lorenzano (1994) also provides a Kuhnian analysis of the\nwork of Argentine Nobel Prize winner Luis Federico Leloir, but in\nterms of a \u201cstructuralized Kuhnian normal science\u201d, that\nis, an \u201cimproved\u201d version of Kuhn\u2019s normal science\nwith the tools of Sneedian or metatheoretical structuralism, but used\nin an informal way.\n\nJuan Manuel Torres (1996), in turn, assesses the various stages in the\nevolution of the competing phenotype and genotype research programs on\nthe origin of life with respect to the crucial Lakatosian notions of\nprogressivity and regressivity. He establishes\ninternal reasons why the RNA version of the genotype program\n(developed in particular by L. Orgel and S. Spiegelman) has taken on a\nprogressive character and enjoys recognition by the international\nscientific community.\n\nAlso appealing to Lakatos, Mart\u00edn Orensanz and Guillermo\nDenegri (2017) examine the possibility of using the methodology of\nscientific research programs for reconstructing the history of\nhelminthology and the comparison between the two rival programs in\nhelminthology, the internalist and the externalist, from the\nseventeenth century to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In\ntheir analysis of the Gaia research program, Nei F. Nunes-Neto,\nRicardo Santos do Carmo, and Charbel N. El-Hani (2009) hold that the\nsuccess of the CLAW hypothesis, named after R.J. Charlson, J.E.\nLovelock, M.O. Andreae, S.G. Warren, can be qualified as a\n\u201cprogressive problem shift\u201d in the understanding of the\nsulphur cycle.\n\nSeveral episodes of biological science are analyzed within the\nframework of structuralist view of theories, Sneedian or\nmetatheoretical structuralism, accepting from the outset that\ninterpretation takes place in philosophy of science and\nhistory of science, as well as in science itself, both in natural and\nsocial and human science (Stegm\u00fcller 1979), and that the working\nprocess in philosophy of science, as well as with its link to history\nof science, can be conceived as one of feedback or reflective\nequilibrium (Stegm\u00fcller 1973, 1986, 1987). Both aspects, the\nhermeneutic and that of understanding the process as one of reflective\nequilibrium, was later emphasized by Schickore (2011).\n\nAlthough the diachronic philosophical analyses made by Santiago\nGinnobili and Daniel Blanco concentrate on the history of evolutionary\nbiology, those carried out by Mario Casanueva, Diego M\u00e9ndez,\nand Pablo Lorenzano do the same with the history of genetics.\nGinnobili (2014) analyzes the relationship between the Darwinian\ntheory of natural selection and the intelligent design of natural\ntheology not only in terms of theoretical incommensurability but also\nof empirical incommensurability, with both concepts of\nincommensurability understood in a structuralist way. Daniel Blanco\n(2016) analyzes the peripheral or accidental changes in the\ndevelopment of the theory of natural selection, and Ginnobili and\nBlanco (2019) analyze the relationship between Darwin\u2019s and\nWallace\u2019s elaborations of the theory of natural selection,\nshowing that the diachronic modification of the set of intended\napplications of the theory of natural selection does not affect its\nidentity. They further analyze the incorporation of some previous\nOwenian components into Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection (D.\nBlanco & Ginnobili 2020).\n\nIn addition, based on his own historiographic research (P. Lorenzano\n1995), Pablo Lorenzano (2007b, 2008) carries out a structuralist\nanalysis of the different theories proposed by the scientists usually\nmentioned in the \u201cofficial story\u201d or \u201corthodox\nimage\u201d of classical genetics (Mendel, the rediscoverers De\nVries, Correns and Tschermak, Bateson and Morgan) as forming a\ncontinuous, cumulative and linear process. His analysis shows that\namong these theoretical developments, there are both continuities and\nruptures, which are best conceptualized in terms of the explicated\nconcepts of theoretical incommensurability and empirical\ncomparability. Moreover, by making more precise some concepts of the\nproblem-solving approach, Lorenzano analyzes the interrogative aspects\nof Mendel\u2019s hybridist theories, the theory of the\ndevelopment/evolution of hybrids and the theory on the cellular\nfoundation of the development/evolution of hybrids (2013b), and the\nchange from Bateson\u2019s Mendelism to Morgan\u2019s Classical\nGenetics (2013c).\n\nComplementary to Lorenzano\u2019s analyses, M\u00e9ndez and\nCasanueva (2012) combine aspects of the structuralist program\u2019s\napparatus with the ordination technique of formal concept\nanalysis (Wille 2005) to reconstruct the domain of biological\nheredity theories from the period of 1865\u20131902. In addition to\nMendel\u2019s proposal, this period includes Brooks\u2019s theory,\nGalton\u2019s and Darwin\u2019s pangenesis, De Vries\u2019\nintracellular pangenesis, Weismann\u2019s germ-plasm theory,\nPearson\u2019s law of ancestral heredity, and Bateson\u2019s and\nYule\u2019s proposals around 1902.\n",
