    "main_text": "Traditional Arguments (B) Con (with Epiphenomenalists\u2019 Responses) || Knowledge of Other Minds\n2.3 Knowledge of Other Minds\n\nOur reason for believing in other minds is inference from behavioral\neffects to mental event causes. But epiphenomenalism denies such a\ncausal connection. Therefore, epiphenomenalism implies the\n(exceedingly implausible) conclusion that we do not know that others\nhave mental events. (Jackson [1982] replies to this and several other\narguments against epiphenomenalism. The argument is stated, and\naccepted, in Benecke 1901.)\n\nThe first premise of this argument is a widely held dogma, but it can\nbe denied without absurdity (see Robinson 1997). It is perfectly\nobvious to everyone that the bodies of human beings are very much\nalike in their construction, and it requires no sophisticated\nreasoning to infer that if others are made like me, they probably hurt\nwhen affected like me, e.g., when their bodies are stuck with pins,\nbeaten, cut and so on. There is no principle that makes an inference\nfrom similar effects to similar causes more secure than an inference\nfrom similar causes to similar effects; on the contrary, the latter\ninference is more secure, because there can sometimes be quite\ndifferent causes of extremely similar effects. Thus, an inference to\nother minds that is allowed by epiphenomenalism must be at least as\nstrong as the inferential route to other minds with which it is\nincompatible.\n",
