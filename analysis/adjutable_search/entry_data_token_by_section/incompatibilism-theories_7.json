    "main_text": "Event-Causal Theories || Efforts of Will\n2.3 Efforts of Will\n\nKane holds that a free decision or other free action is one for which\nthe agent is \u201cultimately responsible\u201d (1996b: 35).\nUltimate responsibility for an action requires either that the action\nnot be causally determined or, if the action is causally determined,\nthat any determining cause of it either be or result (at least in\npart) from some action by that agent that was not causally determined\n(and for which the agent was ultimately responsible). Thus, on\nKane\u2019s view, an agent can be ultimately responsible for a\ndecision that is causally determined by her possessing certain\ncharacter traits. But somewhere among the events that contributed\n(however indirectly) to her having those traits, and thus to her\ndecision, there must have been some free actions by her that were not\ncausally determined. Kane calls such \u201cregress-stopping\u201d\nactions \u201cself-forming actions\u201d (74). All self-forming\nactions, he argues, are acts of will; they are mental actions. He thus\ncalls them \u201cself-forming willings\u201d (125), or SFWs.\n\nKane identifies six different types of SFW, giving the most detailed\ntreatment to what he calls moral choices or decisions and prudential\nchoices or decisions. We shall focus here on the former; the two are\nsufficiently similar that the points made can be easily transferred to\nthe latter.\n\nIn a case of moral choice, there is a motivational conflict within the\nagent. She believes that a certain type of thing morally ought to be\ndone (and she is motivated to do that), but she also has a\nself-interested desire to perform an action of a type that is, in the\ncircumstances, incompatible with her doing what she believes she ought\nto do. Given her commitment to her moral belief, she makes an effort\nof will to resist temptation, an effort \u201cto get [her] ends or\npurposes sorted out\u201d (1996b: 126). If the choice is to be an\nSFW, then it is required that the strength of this effort be\nindeterminate; Kane likens its indeterminacy to that of the position\nor momentum of a microphysical particle. And the effort\u2019s\nindeterminacy is held to be the source of the required indeterminism\nin the causal production of the choice. Again an analogy is drawn with\nan indeterministic understanding of microphysics. Just as whether a\nparticle will penetrate a barrier might be undetermined because the\nparticle does not have both a determinate position and a determinate\nmomentum, so \u201c[t]he choice one way or the other is undetermined\nbecause the process preceding and potentially terminating in it (i.e.,\nthe effort of will to overcome temptation) is indeterminate\u201d\n(128).\n\nKane further requires that any choice that is an SFW satisfy three\nplurality conditions. These require that the choice be made for a\nreason (which Kane takes to consist partly in the choice\u2019s being\ncaused by the agent\u2019s recognizing that reason) and that it not\nbe a result of coercion or compulsion. Each plurality condition also\nrequires that, when the agent makes the choice, she wants more to act\non the reason for which she makes that choice than she wants to act on\nany competing reasons. An agent wants more to act on a certain reason,\nhe holds, when her desire to act on that reason has greater\nmotivational strength than have any desires she has to act on\ncompeting reasons, and when it is settled in the agent\u2019s mind\nthat that reason, rather than her reasons for doing otherwise, is the\none that she will now and in the future act on. This wanting more to\nact on a certain reason is, on Kane\u2019s view, brought about by the\nchoice in question. Finally, the plurality conditions require that,\nwhichever choice is made, there must have been at least one\nalternative choice that the agent was able to make such that, had she\nmade it, it too would have satisfied the previously stated\nconditions.\n\nIn a situation of moral conflict, Kane maintains, the requirements for\nbeing an SFW can be satisfied by either choice that is made\u2014the\nchoice to do what one believes one ought to do or the choice to do\nwhat one is tempted to do. Where this is so, whichever choice the\nagent makes, she has chosen for the reason that she wants more to act\non, free from coercion and compulsion. If she has chosen to do what\nshe believes she ought to do, then her choice is the result of her\neffort. If she has chosen to do what she was tempted to do, then she\nhas not allowed her effort to succeed. Whichever choice she has made,\nshe could have made the other. She is then ultimately responsible for\nthe choice she has made.\n\nWhat, then, of the argument from luck? Kane offers a complex response\nto this problem. First (1996b: 171\u201372), he counters that with\nindeterminate events, exact sameness is not defined. If an\nagent\u2019s effort of will was indeterminate, then it cannot be that\nin the actual world and in some other possible world she made exactly\nthe same effort. An objection that assumes that such exact sameness is\npossible, he holds, does not apply to his view. Kane infers from this\npoint that free will requires a form of indeterminism in which there\nis chance as well as indeterminacy, with the former stemming from the\nlatter. (He calls worlds with such indeterminism\n\u201cnon-Epicurean.\u201d) The chance in an Epicurean world (an\nindeterministic world without indeterminacy), he implies, would\nconstitute control-diminishing luck.\n\nKane\u2019s claim that indeterminacy precludes exact sameness has\nbeen contested (see Clarke 1999, 2002, 2003a, and 2003b: 86\u201387,\nand O\u2019Connor 1996). Moreover, Ishtiyaque Haji (1999a) and Alfred\nMele (1999a and 1999b) contend that the argument from luck is just as\neffective if we consider an agent in worlds that are as similar as can\nbe until the moment of choice, given the indeterminacy of efforts.\nIndeed, the argument might be advanced without any appeal at all to\nother worlds: given that nothing prior to the choice accounts for the\ndifference between the agent\u2019s choosing one way and her choosing\nanother, it may be said, this difference is just a matter of luck.\n\nA further response by Kane to the argument from luck appeals to the\nactive nature of efforts of will. When an agent in a case of moral\nconflict makes an effort to resist temptation, he says, she is trying\nto make the choice to do what she believes she ought to do. If the\nagent then makes that choice, she succeeds, despite the indeterminism,\nat doing what she was actively trying to do. And Kane points out that\ntypically, when someone so succeeds, indeterminism of this sort will\nnot undermine responsibility (and hence it will not so diminish the\nagent\u2019s control that there is not enough for responsibility). He\ndescribes a case (1999b: 227) in which a man hits a glass tabletop\nattempting to shatter it. Even if it is undetermined whether his\neffort will succeed, Kane notes, if the man does succeed, he may well\nbe responsible for breaking the tabletop.\n\nIf left here, the reply would fail to address the problem of luck in a\ncase in which the agent chooses to do what she is tempted to do rather\nthan what she believes she ought to do. In response to this\nshortcoming, Kane (1999a, 1999b, 2000b, 2000c, 2002, 2005: ch. 12,\n2007, and 2011) has proposed a \u201cdoubling\u201d of effort in\ncases of moral conflict. In such a case, he holds, the agent makes\ntwo, simultaneous efforts of will, both indeterminate in strength. The\nagent tries to make the moral choice, and at the same time she tries\nto make the self-interested choice. Whichever choice she makes, then,\nshe succeeds, despite the indeterminism, at doing something that she\nwas actively trying to do.\n\nAlthough it is common to try to make a choice whether to do something\nor not\u2014for example, to try to decide whether to A\u2014it is\nunclear what sense can be made of trying to make some specific\nchoice\u2014e.g., trying to decide to A. Further, supposing that\nsense can be made of this, it would not seem to be rational to try, at\none time, to make each of two obviously incompatible choices.\n\nA more fundamental problem concerns the efficacy of the appeal to the\nactive nature of such efforts. In the case of the man who breaks the\ntabletop, his breaking the tabletop is free (if it is) not just\nbecause it results from an active effort to break the tabletop, but\nbecause it results (we are to presume) from a free effort to break the\ntabletop. A successful effort to make a certain choice can contribute\nin an analogous way to the choice\u2019s being free, then, only if\nthe effort itself is free. If the appeal to these efforts is to\naccomplish anything, then, what is needed is an account of the freedom\nwith which the agent acts in making these efforts of will (Clarke\n2002, 2003a, and 2003b: 89\u201392; Mele 2006: 51\u201352).\n\nIn recent work, Kane (e.g., at 2007b: 174\u201375) accepts that\nresponsibility for choices that are SFWs requires that we be\nresponsible for the efforts of will that produce these choices. We\ngenerally are responsible for these efforts, he maintains, because\nthey are influenced by character and motives resulting from our prior\nfree choices, and because we generally endorse the outcome of such an\neffort when it succeeds\u2014the resulting choice. The second of\nthese observations seems not to the point, since one\u2019s\nresponsibility for an action cannot depend on whether, subsequent to\nthat action, one endorses one of its results. The first observation\nraises a regress problem: what about an agent\u2019s earliest SFWs,\nin which case no prior free choices have influenced the efforts of\nwill preceding the SFWs? Kane says that we are responsible for the\nefforts in these cases as well. But aside from appealing to our\nendorsement of the resulting choices, he does not explain how this can\nbe so.\n\nKane\u2019s appeal to indeterminate efforts of will, and the appeal\nthereby to indeterminism, do not appear to help meet the luck\nobjection. (Neither does it appear that help comes from his\nrequirement that, in making a choice that is an SFW, the agent comes\nto want more to act on the reason for which she makes that choice.\nFor, on Kane\u2019s view, this wanting more is brought about by the\nchoice. And if an event-causal view is on the right track, the\nagent\u2019s control over the making of the choice is a matter of the\nproduction of the choice, not of what the choice produces.) A simpler\ncentered incompatibilist account, then, may fare just as well against\nthe argument from luck.\n",
