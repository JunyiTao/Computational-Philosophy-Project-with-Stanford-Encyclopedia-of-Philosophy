    "main_text": "Theoretical Frameworks\n3. Theoretical Frameworks\n\nAll approaches to the problem of quantum gravity agree that something\nmust be said about the relationship between gravitation and quantized\nmatter. These various approaches can be catalogued in various ways,\ndepending on the relative weight assigned to general relativity and\nquantum field theory. Some approaches view general relativity as in\nneed of correction and quantum field theory as generally applicable,\nwhile others view quantum field theory as problematic and general\nrelativity as having a more universal status. Still others view the\ntheories in a more even-handed manner, perhaps with both simply\namounting to distinct limits of a deeper theory. It has often been\nsuggested, since the earliest days of quantum gravity research, that\nbringing quantum field theory and general relativity together might\nserve to cure their respective singularity problems (the former\nresulting from bad high frequency behaviour of fields; the latter\nresulting from certain kinds of gravitational collapse). This hope\ndoes seem to have been borne out in many of the current approaches.\nRoger Penrose has even argued that the joint consideration of\ngravitation and quantum theory could resolve the infamous quantum\nmeasurement problem (see Penrose 2001; see also the section on the\nmeasurement problem in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory).\n The basic idea of Penrose\u2019s proposal is fairly simple to grasp:\nwhen there is wave-packet spreading of the centre of mass of some\nbody, there results a greater imprecision in the spacetime structure\nassociated with the spreading wave-packet, and this destroys the\ncoherence of the distant parts of the wave-function. There are\ndifficulties in distinguishing the gravitationally induced collapse\nthat Penrose proposes from the effective collapse induced by quantum\ntheory itself, thanks to decoherence\u2014Joy Christian (2005) has\nsuggested that by observing oscillations in the flavor ratios of\nneutrinos originating at cosmological distances one could eliminate\nthe confounding effects of environmental decoherence.\n\nBy far the two most popular approaches are string theory and loop\nquantum gravity. The former is an example of an approach to quantum\ngravity in which the gravitational field is not quantized; rather, a\ndistinct theory is quantized which happens to coincide with general\nrelativity at low energies. The latter is an approach involving\n(constrained) canonical quantization, albeit of a version of general\nrelativity based on a different choice of variables than the usual\ngeometrodynamical, metric-based variables. We cover the basic details\nof each of these in the following subsections.\n",
