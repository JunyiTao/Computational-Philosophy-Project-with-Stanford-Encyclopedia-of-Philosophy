    "main_text": "Epistemology || Disanalogies to Sense-Experience\n9.3 Disanalogies to Sense-Experience\n\nSeveral philosophers have argued against either the Doxastic Practice\nApproach or the Argument from Experience, or both (see Bagger\n1999; Fales 1996a, 1996b, and 2001; Gale 1991,\n1994, and 1995; C.B. Martin\n1955; M. Martin 1990; Proudfoot 1985; Rowe 1982). Philosophers\nhave disputed the Argument from Experience on the grounds of alleged\ndisanalogies between experiences of God and sense-perception. Two\nissues must be examined: whether the disanalogies exist, and if\nthey do exist, whether they are epistemologically significant.\n9.3.1 Lack of Checkability\n\nThe analogy allegedly breaks down over the lack of appropriate\ncross-checking procedures for experiences of God. With\nsense-perception, we can cross-check by employing inductive methods to\ndetermine causally relevant antecedent conditions; we can\n\u201ctriangulate\u201d an event by correlating it with other\neffects of the same purported cause; and we can discover causal\nmechanisms connecting a cause to its effects. These are not available\nfor checking on experiences of God. Evan Fales (2001 and 2010)\nargues that cross-checkability is an integral part of any\nsuccessful perceptual epistemic practice. Therefore, the perceptual\nepistemic practice in which mystical experiences of God are embedded\nis severely defective. Moreover, Richard Gale (1991) argues that\nin experiences of God there is missing agreement between perceivers as\nwell as missing the possibility of checking whether the perceiver was\nin the \u201cright\u201d position and psychological and\nphysiological state for a veridical experience. For similar reasons,\nC.B. Martin (1955) concludes that claims to have experienced God are\n\u201cvery close\u201d to subjective claims like \u201cI seem to\nsee a piece of paper\u201d rather than to objective claims like \u201cI\nsee a piece of paper.\u201d\n\nWilliam Rowe (1982) observes that God may choose to reveal himself to\none person and not to another. Thus, unlike with sense-perception, the\nfailure of others to have an experience of God under conditions\nsimilar to those in which one person did, does not impugn the validity\nof the experience. Therefore, we have no way of determining when an\nexperience of God is delusory. If so, neither can we credit an\nexperience as authentic.\n9.3.2 God\u2019s Lack of Space-Time Coordinates\n\nSome philosophers have argued that there could never be evidence for\nthinking a person had perceived God (Gale 1994 and\n1995; Byrne 2001). For there to be evidence that a person\nexperienced an object O, and did not merely have an\n\u201cO-ish-impression,\u201d it would have to be possible for there\nto be evidence that O was the common object of different perceptions.\nIn turn, this would be possible only if it were possible to\ndistinguish perceptions of O specifically from possible\nperceptions of other objects that might be perceptually similar to O.\nThis latter requirement is possible only if O exists in both space and\ntime. Only space-time coordinates make it possible to distinguish O\nfrom objects of similar appearance existing in other space-time\ncoordinates. God, however, does not exist in space and time.\nTherefore, there could never be evidence that a person had experienced\nGod.\n",
