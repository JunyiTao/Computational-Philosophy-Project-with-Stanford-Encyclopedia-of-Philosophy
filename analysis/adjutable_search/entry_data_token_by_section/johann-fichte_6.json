    "main_text": "Systematic Overview of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre || Philosophy of Law (Recht)\n4.4 Philosophy of Law (Recht)\n\nThe final portion of the Jena system is devoted to \u201cthe\nphilosophy of the postulates,\u201d a discipline that Fichte\nconceived of as occupying the middle ground between purely theoretical\nand purely practical philosophy. In this portion of the system the\nworld is considered neither as it simply is nor as it simply ought to\nbe; instead, either the practical realm of freedom is viewed from the\ntheoretical perspective of the natural world (in which case one\nconsiders the postulates that theoretical reason addresses to\npractical reason) or else, alternatively, the natural world is viewed\nfrom the perspective of practical reason or the moral law (in which\ncase one considers the postulates that practical reason addresses to\ntheoretical reason). The first of these perspectives is that of\njuridical philosophy or philosophy of law, or what Fichte calls the\n\u201cdoctrine of right\u201d (Rechtslehre); the latter is\nthat of the philosophy of religion.\n\nFichte\u2019s philosophy of right (or of \u201cnatural law\u201d),\nas expounded in his Foundation of Natural Right, is one of\nthe most original and influential portions of the Jena\nWissenschaftslehre. Written prior to Kant\u2019s treatment\nof the same topic (in Part One of the Metaphysics of Morals),\nFichte\u2019s philosophy of right is notable, first of all, because\nof the way in which it distinguishes sharply between the realm of\nethics and that of \u201cright\u201d and tries to develop a complete\ntheory of the latter (a \u201ctheory of justice\u201d) without\nappealing to the categorical imperative or the moral law, and\nsecondly, because of the inclusion within this theory of a thoroughly\noriginal \u201cdeduction\u201d of the social character of human\nbeings.\n\nFichte\u2019s transcendental account of natural right proceeds from\nthe general principle that the I must posit itself as an\nindividual in order to posit itself at all, and that in order\nto posit itself as an individual it must recognize itself as\n\u201csummoned\u201d or \u201csolicited\u201d by another\nfree individual\u2014summoned, that is, to limit its own freedom out\nof respect for that of the freedom of the other. The same condition\napplies, of course, to the other; hence, mutual recognition of\nrational individuals turns out to be condition necessary for the\npossibility of I-hood in general. This a priori deduction of\nintersubjectivity is so central to the conception of selfhood\ndeveloped in the Jena Wissenschaftslehre that Fichte, in his\nlectures on Wissenschaftslehre nova methodo, incorporated it\ninto his revised presentation of the very foundations of his system,\nwhere the \u201csummons\u201d takes its place alongside\n\u201coriginal feeling\u201d (which takes the place of the earlier\n\u201ccheck\u201d) as both a limit upon the absolute\nfreedom of the I and a condition for the positing of the same.\n\nThe specific task of Fichte\u2019s theory of right is to consider the\nspecific ways in which the freedom of each individual must be\nrestricted in order that several individuals can live together with\nthe maximum amount of mutual freedom, and it derives its a priori\nconcepts of the laws of social interaction entirely from the sheer\nconcept of an individual I, as conditions for the possibility of the\nlatter. Fichte\u2019s concept of right therefore obtains its binding\nforce not from the ethical law, but rather from the general laws of\nthinking and from enlightened self-interest, and the force of such\nconsiderations is hypothetical rather than categorical. The theory of\nright examines how the freedom of each individual must be externally\nlimited if a free society of free and equal individuals is to\nbe possible.\n\nUnlike Kant, Fichte does not treat political philosophy merely as a\nsubdivision of moral theory. On the contrary, it is an independent\nphilosophical discipline with a topic and a priori principles of its\nown. Whereas ethics analyzes the concept of what is demanded\nof a freely willing subject, the theory of right describes what such a\nsubject is permitted to do (as well as what he can rightfully\nbe coerced to do). Whereas ethics is concerned with the inner\nworld of conscience, the theory of right is concerned only with the\nexternal, public realm, though only insofar as the latter can be\nviewed as an embodiment of freedom.\n\nHaving established the general, albeit hypothetical concept of right,\nFichte then turns to an investigation of the conditions necessary for\nthe realization or \u201capplication\u201d of the same: that is, for\nthe actual coexistence of free individuals, or the existence of a free\nsociety. The sum of these \u201cconditions\u201d constitute the sum\nof our \u201cnatural rights\u201d as human beings, rights that can\nbe instantiated and guaranteed only within a deliberately constructed\nfree society. On purely a priori grounds, therefore, Fichte purports\nto be able to determine the general requirements of such a community\nand the sole justification for legitimate political coercion and\nobligation.\n\nThe precise relationship of Fichte\u2019s theory of right to the\nsocial contract tradition is complex, but the general outline is as\nfollows: Fichte presents an a priori argument for the fundamentally\nsocial character of human beings, an argument grounded upon\nan analysis of the very structure of self-consciousness and the\nrequirements for self-positing. Only after this\n\u201cdeduction\u201d of the concept of right and of the\napplicability of the same does he explicitly introduce the notion of\nwhat he calls the Staatsb\u00fcrgervertrag or\n\u201ccitizens\u2019 contract,\u201d a notion that he goes on to\nanalyze into a series of distinguishable moments, including the\n\u201ccivil contract\u201d proper (or \u201cproperty\ncontract\u201d), the \u201cprotection contract,\u201d and the\n\u201ccontract of unification,\u201d all of which must be\nsupplemented by the contracts of \u201csubjection\u201d and\n\u201cexpiation.\u201d Fichte thus propounds what one might call a\n\u201ccontract theory of the state,\u201d but not of human\ncommunity.\n\nAs numerous commentators, beginning with Hegel, whose own\nPhilosophy of Right was strongly influenced, both positively\nand negatively, by Fichte\u2019s Foundations of Natural\nRight, have pointed out, the actual theory of the state that\nFichte himself, in Part Two of that work, erected upon what would\nappear to be a rather \u201cliberal\u201d theoretical foundation\ncontains many elements that are not usually associated with the\nindividualistic, liberal tradition\u2014including a general\nindifference to questions of constitutional structure, public\nparticipation in government, etc., and a strong emphasis upon the\n\u201cpolice\u201d functions of the state (functions which, for\nFichte, were not limited to concerns of security, but also included\nthose of social welfare). This, however, is not particularly\nsurprising, since the function of the state in Fichte\u2019s system\nis primarily to employ coercion to guarantee that the parties to the\ncontract will, in fact, do what they have promised to do and to insure\nthat every citizen will have an opportunity to realize his own\n(limited) freedom. One of the more remarkable features of\nFichte\u2019s conception of right is that every citizen is entitled\nto the full and productive employment of his labor, and hence that the\nstate has a duty to manage the economy accordingly. The truth is that\nFichte\u2019s social and political theory is very difficult to fit\ninto the usual categories, but combines certain elements usually\nassociated with liberal individualism with others more commonly\nassociated with communitarian statism.\n",
