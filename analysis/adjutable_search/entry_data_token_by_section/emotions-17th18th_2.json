    "main_text": "The Context of Early Modern Theories of the Passions || Changing Vocabulary\n2.1 Changing Vocabulary\n\nPretty much every philosopher of the early modern period developed\ndistinctive terms of art for discussing the emotions. Still, some\nvocabulary was general currency. The most common term for describing\nthe emotions in the seventeenth century was undoubtedly\n\u2018passion,\u2019 perhaps because of the influence of Descartes\u2019s\nPassions of the Soul (1649), perhaps because of a general\ntendency to see the emotions as receptive, passive states. It was not\nthe only term used: \u2018affect\u2019 and \u2018sentiment\u2019\nalso appeared, as did \u2018perturbation,\u2019 and\n\u2018emotion,\u2019 although these were not usually terms of art,\nand \u2018emotion\u2019 usually meant little more than\n\u2018motion.\u2019 The choice of terminology often marked\nintellectual allegiances: Descartes saw himself as introducing a new\ntheory, in which \u201cpassions\u201d are a species of perception,\nwhile Spinoza\u2019s \u201caffects\u201d signaled his debt to Stoic\nethics, as well as distinctive features of his metaphysics. In his\nPens\u00e9es (1670), Pascal introduced\n\u201cfeelings\u201d or \u201csentiments\u201d\n[sentiments], sometimes contrasting them with the corrupted\npassions and marking his neo-Augustinian understanding of love (see\nPens\u00e9es 680, 531).\n\n\u2018Sentiment\u2019 was a particularly popular term in British\nphilosophy of the eighteenth century, as was \u2018affection.\u2019\nThese terms were sometimes used interchangeably with and sometimes in\ncontrast to \u2018passions.\u2019 In the latter case,\n\u2018sentiments\u2019 or \u2018affections\u2019 specified calm\nemotions, perhaps tempered by reflection or refined in some other way;\nwhereas, \u2018passion\u2019 indicated a raw, uncorrected emotion,\nwhich may be \u2018violent\u2019 in the sense of either agitating\nus, or being unresponsive to reason. Bernard Mandeville, for instance,\nspoke of humans as \u201ca compound of passions\u201d in his\nFable of the Bees (1714), emphasizing that our emotions are\ndisorganized, fleeting and not subject to correction. Hutcheson, in\ncontrast, distinguished passions from \u2018affections\u2019 in his\nEssay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and\nAffections (1728), on the grounds that the former are confused\nand \u201cviolent,\u201d while the latter are calm and typically\nbenevolent. Famously, Hume applied \u2018sentiment\u2019 to the\nclass of refined and reflective emotions that are the basis for our\nmoral and aesthetic judgments. In doing so, he may have followed the\npractice of the Abb\u00e9 Dubos in his 1719 Critical Reflections\non Poetry and on Painting  [R\u00e9flexions critiques sur\nla po\u00ebsie et sur la peinture]. There Dubos argued that we do\nnot judge artworks through applications of reason, but by a kind of\ninternal \u201csense\u201d [sentiment interieur] comparable\nto (literal) taste, and which \u201cis commonly called\nsentiment\u201d [le sentiment] (Vol. 2, sec. 22, 306\u2013313; see\nJones 1982, 97). Still, Dubos\u2019s use of the term was casual and\noften ambiguous, and Hume likewise introduced \u2018sentiment\u2019\nin Book III of his Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340) with\nlittle explanation. Nonetheless, the term entered into philosophical\nparlance, such that two decades later, Smith titled his major work\nThe Theory of the Moral Sentiments (1759). Indeed, the\ncontrast between passion and sentiment was not confined to philosophy.\nSarah Fielding\u2019s novel The Adventures of David Simple, first\npublished in 1744 and wildly popular in its day, frequently used\n\u201cpassions\u201d to describe forceful, idiosyncratic emotions\nand desires, particularly those that mark the personality of a\ncharacter, while reserving \u201csentiment\u201d for calmer, shared\naffects and judgments. By 1762, Henry Home, Lord Kames, termed\n\u201cevery thought prompted by a passion\u201d a\n\u201csentiment\u201d (Elements of Criticism I, chap.\nxvi).\n\nThe developments in vocabulary took place against a background of\nshared associations and assumptions about the emotions. Emotions were\ncommonly connected with passivity, and what lay outside of our direct\ncontrol, features often emphasized by using the term\n\u2018passion.\u2019 They were also associated with various forms of\nperception, even as they were sometimes granted an intentional and\njudgment-like structure \u2013 for which the double sense of\n\u2018sentiment\u2019 as felt response and as opinion was\nparticularly apt. Emotions were also often characterized through\nfeelings of either pleasure or pain. At the same time, emotions were\ntypically assumed to have directions (to causes of pleasure, or from\ncauses of pain) and to provide motives for action. Given this cluster,\nphilosophers often emphasized one or another of the features\nassociated with the emotions. Although no philosophical questions were\nsettled by word choice alone, the preferred vocabulary can reveal much\nabout the choice of emphasis.\n\nStill, it is worth bearing in mind that the available vocabulary may\nnot fully capture what we now think of as emotion, affect, or mood.\nWhether called \u2018passion,\u2019 \u2018affect\u2018 or\n\u2018sentiment,\u2019 emotions were usually conceived as having\nobjects, which could be understood causally or intentionally (or\nboth). Kames\u2019s conception of an emotion \u201cin its nature\nquiescent, and merely a passive feeling, [such that it] must have a\ncause; but cannot be said properly speaking, to have an object\u201d\nwas unusual and prompted him to introduce an innovative distinction\nbetween \u2018emotion\u2019 and \u2018passion\u2019 (Elements\nof Criticism I, chap. ii). Sometimes the preferred terminology\ndidn\u2019t even capture the range of affective states recognized by early\nmodern philosophers. Descartes, for instance, wrote of\n\u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cintellectual\u201d emotions, which\nare not passions proper, but certainly have affective components, as\nwell as being causally intertwined with the true passions. Spinoza\ndistinguished \u201caffects\u201d from various emotions and moods\nthat for him indicated \u201cstrength of mind,\u201d while reserving\na special status for \u201cblessedness\u201d [beatitudo]. On\nthe other hand, \u2018passion\u2019 didn\u2019t even begin to get its\ncontemporary flavor of violent, often sexually-charged emotions until\nthe middle of the eighteenth century (at the earliest), and so what\ncounted as a passion can sometimes come as a surprise. Hobbes included\n\u201ccompetition\u201d and \u201cglory\u201d among his passions,\nand many favorite early modern passions are quite placid, such as\n\u2018wonder,\u2019 or \u2018the love of truth.\u2019 There was\nalso a whole special vocabulary for affective states that were\nrecognized by various medical traditions, ranging from\n\u2018splenetic humour\u2019 to general\n\u2018melancholy.\u2019\n",
