    "main_text": "\n\nGertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe was one of the most important\nphilosophers of the twentieth century. She worked on an unusually\nbroad array of topics: the entire range of the history of philosophy\n(ancient, medieval, modern, recent), metaphysics, epistemology,\nphilosophy of language, philosophy of mind/psychology, philosophy of\naction, moral philosophy, political philosophy, and the philosophy of\nreligion. As a result, this entry will have to be very selective.\nDespite the fact that her work is often cryptic and difficult, it\ngreatly influences philosophers working in action theory, moral\nphilosophy, and the philosophy of mind. Like the work of her mentor\nLudwig Wittgenstein, studying Anscombe\u2019s work generates insight\nafter study and struggle.\n",
