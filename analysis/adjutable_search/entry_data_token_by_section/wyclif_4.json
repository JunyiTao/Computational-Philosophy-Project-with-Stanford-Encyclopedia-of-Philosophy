    "main_text": "Logic || The analysis of predication\n2.3 The analysis of predication\n\nWyclif presents his opinion on universals as intermediate between\nthose ones of St. Thomas (and Giles of Rome) and Walter Burley. Like\nGiles, whom he quotes by name, Wyclif recognizes three main kinds of\nuniversals:\n\nante rem, or ideal universals; that is, the ideas in God,\narchetypes of all that there is;\nin re, or formal universals; that is, the common natures\nshared by individual things; and\npost rem, or intentional universals; that is, mental\nsigns by which we refer to the universals in re.\n\n\nThe ideas in God are the causes of the formal universals, and the\nformal universals are the causes of the intentional universals. On the\nother hand, like Burley, Wyclif holds that formal universals exist\nin actu outside our minds, not in potentia as\nmoderate Realists thought \u2014 even though, unlike Burley, he\nmaintains they are really identical with their own individuals. So\nWyclif accepts the traditional realistic account of the relationship\nbetween universals and individuals, but translates it into the terms\nof his own system. According to him, universals and individuals are\nreally the same, but formally distinct, since they\nshare the same empirical reality (that of individuals) but, considered\nas universals and individuals, they have opposite constituent\nprinciples. On the logical side, this means that, notwithstanding real\nidentity, not all that is predicated of individuals can be\ndirectly predicated of universals or vice versa,\nthough an indirect predication is always possible. Hence\nWyclif\u2019s description of the logical structure of the\nrelationship between universals and individuals demanded the\nintroduction of a new kind of predication, unknown to Aristotle, to\ncover cases, admitted by the theory, of indirect inherence of an\naccidental form in a substantial universal and of one second intention\nin another.\n\nTherefore Wyclif distinguished three main types of predication, which\nhe conceived as a real relation that holds between metaphysical\nentities. (On Wyclif\u2019s theory of predication, see Spade 1985,\npp. xxxi-xli, and Conti 1997, pp. 150-58.)\n\nIn the Purgans errores circa universalia in communi (chap.\n2), the three main types of predication are the following: formal\npredication, essential predication, and causal predication. In the\nTractatus de universalibus (chap. 1, pp. 28\u201337), causal\npredication has been replaced by habitudinal predication \u2014 a\nkind of predication that Wyclif had already recognized in the\nPurgans errores circa universalia in communi, but whose\nposition within the main division of types of predication was not\nclear. In the Tractatus de universalibus, formal predication,\nessential predication, and habitudinal predication are described as\nthree non-exclusive ways of predicating, each more general than the\npreceding. We speak of causal predication when the form designated by\nthe predicate term is not present in the entity signified by the\nsubject term, but is something caused by that entity. No instances of\nthis kind of predication are given by Wyclif. Formal predication,\nessential predication, and habitudinal predication are defined in\nalmost the same way in the Purgans errores circa universalia\nand in the Tractatus de universalibus.\n\nFormal predication is that in which the form designated by the\npredicate term is directly present in the entity signified by the\nsubject term. This happens whenever an item in the categorial line is\npredicated of something inferior, or an accident is predicated of its\nsubject of inherence. In fact, in both cases, the subject term and the\npredicate term refer to the same reality in virtue of the form\nconnoted by the predicate term itself.\n\nTo speak of essential predication, it is sufficient that the same\nempirical reality is both the real subject and the predicate, even\nthough the formal principle connoted by the predicate term differs\nfrom that connoted by the subject term. \u2018God is man\u2019 and\n\u2018The universal is particular\u2019 are instances of this kind\nof predication. In fact, the same empirical reality (or essence) that\nis a universal is also an individual, but the forms connoted by the\nsubject term and by the predicate term differ from each other.\n\nFinally we speak of habitudinal predication when the form connoted by\nthe predicate term does not inhere, either directly or indirectly, in\nthe essence designated by the subject, but simply implies a relation\nto it, so that the same predicate may be at different times truly or\nfalsely spoken of its subject without there being any change in the\nsubject itself. According to Wyclif, we use such a kind of predication\nmainly when we want to express theological truths, like: God is known\nand loved by many creatures, and brings about, as efficient, exemplar,\nand final cause, many good effects. It is evident that habitudinal\npredication does not require any kind of identity between the entity\nsignified by the subject term and the entity signified by the\npredicate term, but formal predication and essential predication do.\nSo the ontological presuppositions of the most general type of\npredication, implied by the other types, are completely different from\nthose of the other two.\n\nThe final result of Wyclif\u2019s revolution is therefore an\nincomplete system of intensional logic, which he superimposes on the\nstandard extensional system inherited from Aristotle. As a result, the\ncopula of the philosophical propositions that are dealt with cannot be\nextensionally interpreted, since it does not properly mean that a\ngiven object is a member of a certain set or that a given set is\nincluded in another; rather it means degrees of identity. Only in\nvirtue of renouncing any extensional approach to the matter were\nWyclif\u2019s followers able to give a logically satisfactory\nsolution of the problem of the relationship between universals and\nindividuals, which had always been the most difficult issue for\nmedieval Realists.\n",
