Marriage and Intellectual partnership\n\nIn 1786 at age forty-two, Condorcet married the twenty-two year old\nSophie de Grouchy (1764\u20131822), with whom he forged a loving\nrelationship, similar political convictions, and a solid intellectual\npartnership. Like her husband, de Grouchy was committed to bringing\nabout major judicial and political reforms in France; and her own\nexperiences at a convent left her with a similarly fierce dislike of\nthe Church and a commitment to secular values. The two met through\ntheir common interest in the defense of three peasant victims of\njudicial error and legal abuse, the rou\u00e9s de Chaumont,\nwhose cause had been taken up by de Grouchy\u2019s uncle, the magistrate\nCharles Dupaty, president of the parliament of Bordeaux (see Perrod\n1984). In addition to collaborating frequently in Condorcet\u2019s\nwritings, his wife translated the works of Adam Smith and Thomas\nPaine, and she hosted a leading salon at l\u2019Hotel des Monnaies,\nCondorcet\u2019s residence following his appointment in 1775 as\nInspector-General of the Mint. The salon was attended by many foreign\nvisitors\u2014including Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin\u2019s\ngrandson, Thomas Paine, Charles Stanhope, 3rd earl of\nStanhope, and the Marquis de Beccaria (author of the treatise On\nCrimes and Punishments (1764), which opposed torture and the\ndeath penalty)\u2014along with the writer Pierre-Auguste Caron de\nBeaumarchais, the playwright and pamphleteer Olympe de Gouges (author\nof the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female\nCitizen), and the writer and hostess Madame de Sta\u00ebl. During\nthe early years of the Revolution the Condorcet salon was an important\nvenue for followers of the Girondin, and it hosted meetings of the\npreviously mentioned Cercle Social, one of the revolutionary\nclubs most supportive of women\u2019s participation and women\u2019s rights.\nAfter 1789, Condorcet also frequented other salons associated with the\nGirondins such as those of Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud and\nMme (Marie-Jeanne) Roland (Williams 2004, 13).\n\nMme de Condorcet was an accomplished translator and author, in her own\nright; and she shared her husband\u2019s liberal and republican views,\nespecially on matters of criminal justice, political reform, and\nminority and women\u2019s rights. For her attendance at the lyc\u00e9e\nwhere Condorcet taught mathematics and others gave lessons in history\nand the sciences, Mme de Condorcet became known as the\nV\u00e9nus\n Lyc\u00e9enne.[13]\n She learned English expressly in order to read in the original and\ntranslate the seventh edition of Adam Smith\u2019s Theory of Moral\nSentiments, appearing in 1792 in London, despairing like many of\nher contemporaries of the inadequacy of the existing French\n translation.[14]\n In 1791, along with Thomas Paine, the Condorcets founded la\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9publicaine [the Republican\nSociety], sometimes credited as the first republican society in\nFrance; and Mme de Condorcet translated Paine\u2019s writings for the\njournal of the Society, La R\u00e9publicain ou d\u00e9fenseur\ndu gouvernement repr\u00e9sentatif [The Republican or defender\nof representative government]. Separated from one another during his\nperiod of flight, with his wife\u2019s encouragement the philosopher\nundertook the writing of his last works, while she too was composing\nthe text known as Lettres \u00e0 Cabanis sur la sympathie\n[Letters to Cabanis on Sympathy], in which she sets forth her own\nideas on achieving \u201ca society of happiness\u201d. As she wrote\nin her Eighth Letter,\n\n\nwhere is the one who, instead of always looking beyond nature for a\nnew way of enjoying or abusing its blessings, finds each day a new\npleasure in changing all the bonds of duty and servitude around him\ninto relations of charity, good faith and kindness \u2026 (Grouchy\n1994, 183; for scholarly appreciations of Grouchy\u2019s translation of\nAdam Smith, her independent contribution to moral philosophy, and her\nintellectual impact on Condorcet, see Dawson 2004; Brown 2008; Grouchy\n2010)\n\n\nIn one of his last writings, Condorcet addressed a testament to his\ninfant daughter (b. 1790), which shows the enormous respect he held\nfor his wife\u2019s intellect and moral character. \u201cWhen the moment\nof justice has come\u201d, he writes, \u201cshe will find help in my\nwritings. The advice I have written for her, and her mother\u2019s letters\non friendship, will provide a moral education. Other writings by her\nmother give very useful viewpoints on the same subject\u201d\n(\u201cCondorcet\u2019s Testament (March 1794)\u201d, in McLean and\nHewitt 1994, 290). In his advice to his daughter not to stifle her\nfeelings for all other beings, he also echoes his wife\u2019s views on\nsensibility. He is firm on the need not to let resentment overwhelm\nthe soul\u2019s natural disposition to sympathize with others; and, in a\nstriking passage, he cautions the girl that even acts of cruelty\ntoward animals can lead to a brutalization of her originally good\nnature: \u201cThis gentle sensitivity\u201d, he states,\n\n\nwhich can be a source of happiness, originates in the natural feelings\nwhich makes us share the sorrow of all sentient beings. Preserve it in\nall its purity and all its strength. Do not limit it to the suffering\nof men, but extend your humanity even to animals. Do not make any\nwhich belong to you unhappy; do not neglect their welfare; do not be\ninsensitive to their na\u00efve and sincere gratitude; cause them no\nunnecessary pain. Anything of the sort would be a true injustice and\nan insult to nature, who would punish you by the hardness of heart\nwhich habitual cruelty must produce. Lack of foresight in animals is\nthe only excuse for the barbarous law which condemns them to serve as\nfood for one another. Let us remain faithful to nature, and go no\nfurther than this excuse permits. (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 287)\n\n\nAt the same time, he counsels his daughter not to exaggerate her\nsensitivity, for that too can be a trap:\n\n\nI shall not give you the useless advice to avoid passion and to beware\nof being too sensitive, but I will tell you to be sincere with\nyourself and not to exaggerate your sensitivity, whether for your\nvanity, to delude your imagination, or to excite that of another.\n(McLean and Hewitt 1994, 287)\n\n\nHe cautions her to \u201censure that the feelings of equality and\njustice become second nature to you\u201d and asks her guardians to\nbring her up\n\n\nto love freedom and equality, and to have republican values and\nvirtues. Ensure that she harbours no feelings of personal\nvengefulness, and that she is taught to protect herself from the\nperils of a sensitive and impulsive nature. Let this be asked of her\nin my name; and let her be told that I was never prey to such things.\n(McLean and Hewitt 1994, 290).\n\n\nPerhaps most remarkable about the couple is how they managed to\nmaintain their optimism at the most perilous moment of their lives\ntogether. In 1793, despite their forced separation and the dangers\nthey faced, she worked on her Letters, he on his\nEsquisse, both works that express unwavering faith in human\nprogress and goodness. As A. Pons (preface, A. de G. Condorcet 1994,\n10) remarks,\n\n\nIt is the moment when he was hunted and obliged to hide himself that\nCondorcet wrote his hymn to progress, which is his Esquisse.\nIt is the moment when she lived with anxiety about her husband, her\ndaughter and herself, and when she was surrounded by the hate of the\nJacobin revolutionaries and the members of her class who reproached\nher for her treason, that Sophie vaunted the sweet effects of\nsympathy! [my translation])\n\n\nIn 1795, after her husband\u2019s death, Mme de Condorcet published the\nEsquisse, and in 1799, his \u00c9loges des\nacademicians [Eulogies for the Academicians]; and she revived her\nsalon at Auteuil at the former home of another salonni\u00e8re,\n(Anne-Catherine de Ligniville) Madame Helv\u00e9tius\n(1722\u20131800). Under the Consulate and the Empire, Mme de\nCondorcet hosted yet another salon, which was a meeting place for\ndissenting republicans. She worked assiduously to defend Condorcet\u2019s\nreputation and to publish his complete works, a version of which\nappeared from 1801 to 1804, with the assistance of her brother-in-law,\nthe French physician and prominent Id\u00e9ologue Pierre Cabanis,\nalong with the revolutionary politician and writer Joseph Garat, and\nthe bibliographer and librarian Antoine Alexandre A.-A. Barbier. The\nproject was continued after her death, resulting in a second collected\nedition in 1847\u20131849, undertaken by her daughter Eliza (Louise\nAlexandrine de Condorcet, b.1790) and son-in-law, the exiled Irish\nrevolutionary Arthur O\u2019Connor, with the assistance of Fran\u00e7ois\nArago, Condoret\u2019s successor as Secretary of the Academy of Sciences\n(Institute de France). (The first volume of the second edition of the\nOeuvres completes included a sympathetic biography of the\nphilosopher by Arago. A. Condorcet O\u2019Connor and F. Arago 1968 [orig.\n1847\u20139]. For other classic French works on Condorcet, see: Vial\n1970 [orig. 1902]; Cahen 1904; Alengry 1971 [orig. 1904]; Koyr\u00e9\n1948; and the influential intellectual biography by E. and R.\nBadinter, 1988).\n\nCondorcet\u2019s partnership with this exceptional woman doubtless\nconfirmed him in his generous views about women\u2019s abilities,\nstrengthened his commitment to women\u2019s independence and liberty; and,\nmost assuredly, spurred him on to address concretely the need to\nrectify the injustices to which all women were subjected in an age of\npurportedly greater enlightenment.\n",
