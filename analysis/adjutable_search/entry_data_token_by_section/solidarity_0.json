    "main_text": "The Nature of Solidarity\n1. The Nature of Solidarity\n\nIn social and political philosophy, the concept of solidarity is\nprimarily used to evaluate, guide, and describe activities within\ngroups and between individuals and groups. In unpacking different\naccounts, it is useful to begin by listing some typical\npractice-embedded expressions in which the concept is used. In a\nconversation about our work environment, someone might say, \u201cwe\nshould show more solidarity with one another\u201d; in a conversation\nabout the origins of the welfare state, someone might say, \u201cthe\nwelfare state is an expression of solidarity among citizens\u201d; in\na conversation about the dynamics of social movements, someone might\nsay, \u201cthe neo-Nazi protesters acted in solidarity with one\nanother\u201d; in a conversation about supporting the Movement for\nBlack Lives (M4BL), someone might say, \u201cI stand in solidarity\nwith you in fighting oppression\u201d; in a conversation about the\nmoral values animating European integration as a project, someone\nmight say, \u201csolidarity is a foundational value of the European\nUnion\u201d; in a conversation about the downsides of investment\nbanking, someone might say, \u201cthere is not much solidarity among\nbankers\u201d; in a conversation about the plight of earthquake\nvictims in Indonesia, someone might say, \u201csolidarity requires\nthat we send some money as soon as possible\u201d; in responding to\nnews that a teammate has cancer, someone might say: \u201cwe ought to\nshave our heads in solidarity\u201d. What accounts of the concept can\naid us in evaluating and describing the phenomenon referred to in\nthese and similar circumstances?\n\nAt the broadest level, philosophers (such as O\u2019Neill 1996: 201\nand Miller 2017: 62) usually distinguish between two senses of\nsolidarity: solidarity among and solidarity with.\nAccording to the former, solidarity describes a relation among members\nof the same social group. As we will see in more detail below,\nsolidarity among usually requires a rough symmetry in the\nattitudes and dispositions of its members. For example, we might both\nidentify as members of Danish nation, share a commitment to overthrow\nthe occupiers, and each be willing to come to each other\u2019s aid\nin fighting them. On the other hand, solidarity with\ndescribes a relation between an individual and another individual, or\nbetween a set of individuals and the members of a social group of\nwhich the former are not members (the \u201coutgroup\u201d). On this\nreading, symmetry is not required: I might act in solidarity with you\nas an earthquake victim when I wire money to an NGO that is operative\nin your city. Here I act in solidarity with you without your acting in\nsolidarity with me (or even being disposed to act in solidarity with\nme were the tables to be turned). A paradigmatic example of\nsolidarity with is the Catholic notion of solidarity\nunderstood as a form of caritas, or charity (on an\nalternative interpretation of solidarity in the Catholic tradition,\nsee below). As J\u00f3zef Tischner, who was influential in\nPoland\u2019s solidarity movement, writes:\n\n\nWith whom, therefore, is our solidarity? It is, above all, with those\nwho have been wounded by other people, with those who suffer pain that\ncould be avoided\u2014accidental, needless pain. This does not\npreclude solidarity with others, with all who suffer. However, the\nsolidarity with those who suffer at the hands of others is\nparticularly vital, strong, spontaneous. (Tischner 1982 [1984]:\n8\u20139)\n\n\nPhilosophers divide on whether asymmetric, unilateral forms of aid and\nsupport from individuals to other individuals, or from outgroup\nmembers to ingroups counts as genuine solidarity. For some\n(see, e.g., Sangiovanni forthcoming), they do not. We do better, he\nargues, not to conceive of solidarity with as a form of\nsolidarity at all. The unilateral, asymmetric reading, he argues,\ntends to vitiate the egalitarianism at the heart of solidarity, and\ndoes not fit well with the practices in which the term was,\nhistorically, most prevalent. He also argues that solidarity\nwith in this narrower sense is not distinguishable from other,\nrelated terms, such as \u201chumanitarian aid\u201d,\n\u201ccharity\u201d, \u201cbenevolence\u201d, or \u201csupport\nfor a good cause\u201d. There is nothing gained in calling forms of\nhumanitarian aid or support for a good cause \u201csolidarity\u201d,\nand running the two ideas together under a single banner tends to\nobscure the value of solidarity as a form of egalitarian collective\naction.\n\nFor other philosophers (e.g., Kolers 2016), solidarity (whether\nwith or among) must always be unilateral\nand asymmetric. Kolers argues that paradigmatic cases of solidarity\ninvolve one group or individual (usually members of an outgroup),\nS, deferring to an object group, G, but not\nvice versa. According to Kolers,\n\n\n[solidary action] is not principally justified by appeal to goals, nor\ndo we choose sides on the basis of shared goals. To the contrary, when\nS is in solidarity with G, it is G, not\nG\u2019s ends, that S endorses or values. S is\ndisposed to adopt whatever goal G sets for the action\nor as a political aim. For instance, insofar as they are in\nsolidarity, heterosexual persons who support the right of same-sex\ncouples to marry do so not because they individually want same-sex\nmarriages to be possible, but because the LGBTQ community treats that\nas an important goal. (Kolers 2016: 58)\n\n\nParadigmatic instances of solidarity involve members of (out)groups\n(e.g., heterosexuals) committing themselves to do whatever members of\na disadvantaged (in)group (e.g., homosexuals) require to overcome\ninjustice. Importantly, on this picture outgroup members commit to the\ngroup, rather than to any aim pursued by the group. As a\nheterosexual, I do not act in solidarity by committing\ndirectly to fighting heterosexism alongside members of the LGBTQ\ncommunity; rather, to act in solidarity, I must commit to the LGBTQ\ncommunity as such, and so to whatever members tell me I need to do to\npromote their cause, whatever cause that is.\n\nOne advantage of this view is that it captures an important ethical\naspect of coalitional social movements in which more privileged\n(out)groups act as allies of less privileged (in)groups in fighting\ninjustice. As has often been noted, the trouble with such coalitions\nis that members of privileged groups often tend to be blind to the way\nin which privilege colors and sometimes distorts their efforts to\nsupport the aims of the\n movement.[1]\n Outgroup allies can sometimes reproduce, unconsciously, wider\nstructural patterns of power and exclusion as they fight alongside\ningroup members; they can perpetrate, for example, forms of epistemic\ninjustice in seeking to impose their own agenda or ideals onto the\nwider movement (Deveaux 2021; Clark 2014; Medina 2013; Gould 2020;\nLand 2015). Kolers\u2019 work reminds his readers that genuine\nsolidarity requires that members of outgroups put aside their\nparticular concerns, ideals, prejudices, and so on, and\nlisten (Kolers 2016: 115). They must be prepared, in turn, to\naccept their relative epistemic limitations vis-\u00e0-vis members\nof ingroups who not only have \u201cskin in the game\u201d but often\na vivid lived experience of the forms of injustice they are fighting.\nAnd they must also be prepared to defer out of respect for the\ndisadvantaged: whether or not the disadvantaged have better epistemic\naccess to truths about the struggle, etc., the privileged ought to\ndefer out of respect for what is at stake for the\n disadvantaged.[2]\n\nSo far, we have discussed unilateral, asymmetric accounts of our\ntarget concept. We now turn to accounts of the concept that treat the\nidea of solidarity among as paradigmatic. Rather than naming\nthe set of attitudes and actions characteristic of an individual who\n(unilaterally) offers support or aid, the idea of solidarity\namong names a relation among members of the\nsame group. The relation is generally understood to make it\nthe case that the group exhibits a distinctive kind of unity\namong its members (solidus in Latin means whole or\nintegrated). But what kind of unity? The unity in question is\ncomposed, on all plausible views, by an interlocking set of attitudes,\ndispositions, and characteristic actions displayed by members. It is\nuseful to compare relations of solidarity to the relations\nconstituting social groups as such. According to one\ninfluential definition of a social group, a social group \n\n\nis a collection of individuals who perceive themselves to be members\nof the same social category, share some emotional involvement in this\ncommon definition of themselves, and achieve some degree of social\nconsensus about the evaluation of their group and their membership of\nit. (Tajfel & Turner 2001: 100). \n\n\nPeople waiting at a bus stop, or boarding a train, are not, in normal\ncircumstances, a social group; employees of Google and members of the\nChurch of England are. We can then say: For an (in)group to display\nsolidarity, it must recognize itself as a social group: members must\nidentify themselves based on some characteristic that marks them out\nas a social group. For example, members might identify as\nworkers (on the basis, that is, of a role), as black\n(on the basis of racial\n categorization[3]),\n as cancer survivors (on the basis of a common set of\nexperiences), as environmentalists (on the basis of a shared\ncause), and so\n on.[4]\n But what other conditions are necessary (or at least paradigmatic)?\nIdentifying as a social group is not sufficient: it seems clear that\nwe might identify as employees of Google, or as engineers, or as\ninvestment bankers, but not be in solidarity with one another.\n\nAn obvious candidate is the condition that members of the social group\nbe disposed to put aside narrow self-interest in coming to each\nother\u2019s aid when required. We might imagine, for example, that\nthe employees of Google or investment bankers are not prepared to set\naside narrow self-interest except in special circumstances (where,\nsay, employees know one another independently). If this were true,\nthen it seems clear that, in their normal everyday interactions, they\nwouldn\u2019t be in solidarity with one another (despite their\ncooperation). Some philosophers believe that these two\nconditions\u2014identifying as a member of a social group and a\nwillingness, on that basis, to set aside narrow self-interest in\ncoming to a fellow\u2019s aid\u2014are necessary and\nsufficient for solidarity. Philippe Van Parijs, for example,\nwrites:\n\n\nWhen I help you out of solidarity, I do so because you are \u201cone\nof us\u201d, because \u201cI could have been you\u201d, because, in\nthis sense, I \u201cidentify\u201d with you. (Van Parijs\nforthcoming; see also Mason 2000: 27)\n\n\nTo illustrate, Van Parijs gives the example of a fellow traveler\nreturning a lost wallet, or a cyclist helping another to board a\ntrain. In both cases, someone identifies as a traveler (or as a\ncyclist) and, in virtue of that identification, is disposed to come to\nanother traveler or cyclist\u2019s aid.\n\nAn advantage of the view is that it can encompass a wide variety of\ndifferent contexts. It can, for example, account for\nunilateral senses of solidarity, such as the Good Samaritan.\nAs long as the Good Samaritan is motivated by a relevant\nself-categorization that includes the stranger, then his coming to his\naid counts as solidarity. The Good Samaritan might feel disposed to\naid because he has shared the experience of being a victim of\ninjustice, or because of their shared vulnerability, say, as human\nbeings. But its encompassing nature may also make it hard to\ndistinguish from related notions. The account seems to collapse into\nthe view that solidarity is another name for all responsibilities that\nflow (or that are perceived to flow) from membership in a social\ngroup.\n\nTommie Shelby offers a view that is broadly similar in structure, but\nstrengthens the requirements for mutual identification and group\ncohesion. For Shelby,\n\n\nI believe there are five core normative requirements that are jointly\nsufficient for a robust form of solidarity [identification with the\ngroup, special concern, shared values or goals, loyalty, and mutual\ntrust]. By \u201crobust\u201d I mean a solidarity that is strong\nenough to move people to collective action, not just mutual sympathy\nborn of recognition of communality or a mere sense of group belonging.\n(Shelby 2005: 68; see also May 1996: 44; cf. Feinberg 1973: 677)\n\n\nReturning a lost wallet and the Good Samaritan, on this view, are\nruled out since they are products of a weak sense of group belonging.\nOne may object, however, that the view is still not restrictive\nenough. For example, a reading group might exhibit all five features,\nand move its participants to do things together, and yet it seems\nstrained to say that a reading group is in solidarity with one\nanother. (It is strained not so much because it doesn\u2019t capture\nthe ordinary English meaning, but because it seems to jar with the\nvalue and history of the practices in which the term has predominantly\nfigured, and which make sense of the role we might want an account of\nsolidarity to play.) It is also unclear, on this view, whether\ncollective action is a necessary condition of solidarity, or whether\ntwo or more people can be in solidarity by holding the attitudes\nmentioned without ever acting together in some relevant sense. Might\nbrothers be in solidarity by possessing all five of the listed\nattitudes, though they never act together in the pursuit of any goals,\nor come to each other\u2019s aid in any way?\n\nSally Scholz offers a view of solidarity that is explicitly political\nand oppositional. For Scholz,\n\n\nPolitical solidarity arises in opposition to something; it is a\nmovement for social change that may occur at many levels of social\nexistence. \u2026 Natural disasters may inspire strong sentiments\nand even bonds of connection, but they do not inspire political\nsolidarity. Political solidarity as I present it has a social justice\ncontent or aim; it opposes injustice, oppression, tyranny, and social\nvulnerabilities. (Scholz 2008: 54; see also Mohanty 2003:\n 7)[5]\n\n\nSolidarity, on this view, is always geared toward overcoming\ninjustice; it is essentially political. The reading group would be\nexcluded, and so would be the Good Samaritan and sending money to\nearthquake victims. Scholz also argues that the concept entails the\nexistence of positive moral obligations among participants. If\nparticipants (for example, a white supremacist group) lack positive\nobligations to aid each other in protesting racial integration\n(because such a protest would be in the service of unjust ends), then\nthey cannot act in solidarity when they protest, come to each\nother\u2019s aid, and are committed to their cause.\n\nAndrea Sangiovanni offers a view that is less restrictive (but more\nrestrictive than Shelby\u2019s). In contrast to Scholz, he argues\nthat solidarity must always be aimed at overcoming adversity, but the\nadversity need not be political. For example, suppose a village burns\ndown in a fire and residents band together to rebuild it. They are\ncommitted to the endeavor and are ready to come to each other\u2019s\naid. Because their endeavor is oriented toward overcoming shared\nadversity it counts as solidarity. Furthermore, for Sangiovanni, the\nconcept solidarity is not moralized: even mafiosi can be in solidarity\nwith one another (despite the fact, that is, that their solidarity\nwill promote bad ends). Finally, solidarity, he claims, neither merely\nprecedes collective action (or, as Shelby argues, makes it\nmore likely) nor is it merely a by-product of collective\naction, but is itself a form of collective action. As a kind\nof action, it does not therefore name only a set of desires and\nbeliefs, a virtue, or a sense of fellowship with others. Rather,\nsolidarity is any instance of collective action that has the following\ncore features:\n\nParticipants identify with one another on the basis of a role,\ncondition, cause, set of experiences, or way of life on the basis of\nwhich \u2026\n\n\n\u2026 they each \u2026\n\n\u2026intend to do their part in overcoming some significant\nadversity, X, by pursuing, together, some more proximate shared\ngoal, Y;\n \u2026 are individually committed (i) to X and Y\nand (ii) to not bypassing each other\u2019s will in the achievement\nof X and Y;\n \u2026 are committed to sharing one another\u2019s fates in\nways relevant to X and Y.\n \u2026 trust one another to play their part in X and\nY, trust each other\u2019s commitment, trust that each will\nnot bypass the other\u2019s will, and trust each to share the\nother\u2019s fate.\n \n\n\nThis view faces a number of challenges as well. First, like Shelby and\nScholz, it doesn\u2019t allow for unilateral cases of\nsolidarity\u2014such as the Good Samaritan and sending money to\nearthquake victims\u2014to count as instances of solidarity since\nthere is no collective action in the required sense. Second, and\nrelatedly, it doesn\u2019t allow for cases of \u201csilent\u201d or\n\u201cprivate\u201d solidarity (Bommarito 2016; Zhao 2019). As a\nyoung girl, Simone Weil gave up eating sugar because sugar had become\nunavailable to soldiers at the front. It seems plausible to say that\nshe acted in solidarity with the soldiers. What reasons do we\nhave to rule such cases out? And, finally, it seems to rule out\nprotest movements that are organized on behalf of victims of\ninjustice but not with them. Imagine we organize a protest\nagainst the French government\u2019s closure of the refugee camps in\nCalais, and suppose that the refugees there do not know of, or\notherwise take part in, our protest. Sangiovanni\u2019s account seems\nto force us to say that we, on the outside, act in solidarity with one\nanother but not with the refugees.\n",
