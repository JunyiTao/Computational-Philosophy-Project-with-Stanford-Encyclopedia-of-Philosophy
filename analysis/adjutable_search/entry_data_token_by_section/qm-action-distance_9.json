Wave functions do not represent the states of systems.\nRather, they are states of a \u2018quantum field (on configuration\nspace)\u2019 that influences the states of\n systems.[14]\n Also, particles always have definite positions, and the positions of\nthe particles and their wave function at a certain time jointly\ndetermine the trajectories of the particles at all future times. Thus,\nparticles\u2019 positions and their wave function determine the\noutcomes of any measurements (so long as these outcomes are recorded\nin the positions of some physical systems, as in any practical\nmeasurements).\n\n\nThere are various versions of Bohm's theory. In the\n\u2018minimal\u2019 Bohm theory, formulated by Bell\n (1982),[15]\n the wave function is interpreted as a \u2018guiding\u2019 field\n(which has no source or any dependence on the particles) that\ndeterministically governs the trajectories of the particles according\nto the so-called \u2018guiding equation\u2019 (which expresses the\nvelocities of the particles in terms of the wave\n function).[16]\n The states of systems are separable (the state of any composite\nsystem is completely determined by the state of its subsystems), and\nthey are completely specified by the particles\u2019\npositions. Spins, and any other properties which are not directly\nderived from positions, are not intrinsic properties of\nsystems. Rather, they are relational properties that are determined by\nthe systems\u2019 positions and the guiding field. In particular,\neach of the particles in the EPR/B experiment has dispositions to\n\u2018spin\u2019 in various directions, and these dispositions are\nrelational properties of the particles\u2014 they are\n(generally) determined by the guiding field and the positions of the\nparticles relative to the measurement apparatuses and to each\nother.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. The EPR/B experiment with Stern-Gerlach\nmeasurement devices. Stern-Gerlach 1 is on, set up to measure the\nz-spin of the L-particle, and Stern-Gerlach 2 is off. The\nhorizontal lines in the left-hand-side denote the trajectories of six\nL-particles in the spin singlet state after an (impulsive)\nz-spin measurement on the L-particle, and the horizontal\nlines in the right-hand-side denote the trajectories of the\ncorresponding R-particles. The center plane is aligned orthogonally to\nthe z-axis, so that particles that emerge above this plane\ncorrespond to z-spin \u2018up\u2019 outcome and particles\nthat emerge below this plane correspond to z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 outcome. The little arrows denote the\nz-spin components of the particles in the\n\u2018non-minimal\u2019 Bohm theory (where spins are intrinsic\nproperties of particles), and are irrelevant for the\n\u2018minimal\u2019 Bohm theory (where spins are not intrinsic\nproperties of particles).\n\n\n\n\nTo see the nature of non-locality postulated by the minimal Bohm\ntheory, consider again the EPR/B experiment and suppose that the\nmeasurement apparatuses are Stern-Gerlach (S-G) magnets which are\nprepared to measure z-spin. In any run of the experiment, the\nmeasurement outcomes will depend on the initial positions of the\nparticles and the order of the measurements. Here is why. In the\nminimal Bohm theory, the spin singlet state denotes the relevant state\nof the guiding field rather than the intrinsic properties of the\nparticle pair. If the L-measurement occurs before the R-measurement,\nthe guiding field and the position of the L-particle at the emission\ntime jointly determine the disposition of the L-particle to emerge\nfrom the S-G device either above or below a plane aligned in the\nz-direction; where emerging above (below) the plane means\nthat the L-particle z-spins \u2018up\u2019\n(\u2018down\u2019) about the z-axis and the L-apparatus\n\u2018pointer\u2019 points to \u2018up\u2019 (\u2018down\u2019)\n(see Fig. 4 above). All the L-particles that are emitted above the\ncenter plane aligned orthogonally to the z-direction, like\nthe L-particles 1-3, will be disposed to spin \u2018up\u2019; and\nall the particles that are emitted below this plane, like the\nL-particles 4-6, will be disposed to spin \u2018down.\u2019\nSimilarly, if the R-measurement occurs before the L-measurement, the\nguiding field and the position of the R-particle at the emission time\njointly determine the disposition of the R-particle to emerge either\nabove the z-axis (i.e., to z-spin \u2018up\u2019)\nor below the z-axis (i.e., to z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019) according to whether it is above or below the\ncenter plane, independently of the position of the L-particle along\nthe z-axis.\n\n\nBut the z-spin disposition of the R-particle changes\nimmediately after an (earlier) z-spin measurement on the\nL-particle: The R-particles 1-3 (see Fig. 4), which were previously\ndisposed to z-spin \u2018up,\u2019 will now be disposed to\nz-spin \u2018down,\u2019 i.e., to emerge below the center\nplane aligned orthogonally to the z-axis; and the R-particles\n4-6, which were previously disposed to z-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 will now be disposed to z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 i.e., to emerge above this center plane. Yet, the\nL-measurement per se does not have any immediate influence on\nthe state of the R-particle: The L-measurement does not influence the\nposition of the R-particle or any other property that is directly\nderived from this position. It only changes the guiding field, and\nthus grounds new spin dispositions for the R-particle. But these\ndispositions are not intrinsic properties of the R-particle. Rather,\nthey are relational properties of the R-particle, which are grounded\nin the positions of both particles and the state of the guiding\n field.[17] \n(Note that in the particular case in which the L-particle is emitted\nabove the center plane aligned orthogonally to the z-axis and\nthe R-particle is emitted below that plane, an earlier z-spin\non the L-particle will have no influence on the outcome of a\nz-spin on the R-particle.)\n\n\nWhile there is no contiguous process to carry the influence of the\nL-measurement outcome on events in the R-wing, the question of whether\nthis influence amounts to action at a distance depends on the exact\ncharacterization of this term. In contrast to the GRW/Pearle collapse\nmodels, the influence of the L-measurement outcome on the intrinsic\nproperties of the R-particle is dependent on the R-measurement: Before\nthis measurement occurs, there are no changes in the R-particle's\nintrinsic properties. Yet, the influence of the L-measurement on the\nR-particle is at a distance. Thus, the EPR/B experiment as depicted by\nthe minimal Bohm theory involves action* at a distance but not action\nat a distance. \n\n\nBohm's theory portrays the quantum realm as deterministic.  Thus, the\nsingle-case objective probabilities, i.e., the chances, it assigns to\nindividual spin-measurement outcomes in the EPR/B experiment are\ndifferent from the corresponding quantum-mechanical probabilities.  In\nparticular, while in quantum mechanics the chances of the outcomes\n\u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 in an earlier L- (R-) spin\nmeasurement are both \u00bd, in Bohm's theory these chances are\neither one or zero. Yet, Bohm's theory postulates a certain\ndistribution, the so-called \u2018quantum-equilibrium\ndistribution,\u2019 over all the possible positions of pairs with the\nsame guiding field. This distribution is computed from the\nquantum-mechanical wave function, and it is typically interpreted as\nignorance over the actual position of the pair; an ignorance that may\nbe motivated by dynamical considerations and statistical patterns\nexhibited by ensembles of pairs with the same wave function (for more\ndetails, see the entry on bohmian mechanics, section 9). And the\nsum-average (or more generally the integration) over this distribution\nreproduces all the quantum-mechanical observable predictions.\n\n\nWhat is the status of this probability postulate? Is it a law of\nnature or a contingent fact (if it is a fact at all)? The answers to\nthese questions vary (see Section 7.2.1, Bohm 1953, Valentini 1991a,b,\n1992, 1996, 2002, Valentini and Westman 2004, D\u00fcrr, Goldstein and\nZangh\u00ec 1992a,b, 1996, fn. 15, and Callender 2006).\n\n\nTurning to the question of non-separability, the minimal Bohm theory\ndoes not involve state non-separability. For recall that in this\ntheory the state of a system does not consist in its wave function,\nbut rather in the system's position, and the position of a composite\nsystem always factorizes into the positions of its subsystems. Here,\nthe non-separability of the wave function reflects the state of the\nguiding field. This state propagates not in ordinary three-space but\nin configuration space, where each point specifies the configuration\nof both particles. The guiding field of the particle pair cannot be\nfactorized into the guiding field that governs the trajectory of the\nL-particle and the guiding field that governs the trajectory of the\nR-particle. The evolution of the particles\u2019 trajectories,\nproperties and dispositions is non-separable, and accordingly the\nparticles\u2019 trajectories, properties and dispositions are\ncorrelated even when the particles are far away from each other and do\nnot interact with each other. Thus, process separability fails.\n\n\nIn the non-minimal Bohm\n theory[18],\n the behavior of an N-particle system is determined by its\nwave function and the intrinsic properties of the particles. But, in\ncontrast to the minimal theory, in the non-minimal theory spins are\nintrinsic properties of particles. The wave function always evolves\naccording to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and it is interpreted as a\n\u2018quantum field\u2019 (which has no sources or any dependence on\nthe particles). The quantum field guides the particles via the\n\u2018quantum potential,\u2019 an entity which is determined from\nthe quantum field, and the evolution of properties is fully\n deterministic.[19]\n\n\nLike in the minimal Bohm theory, the non-separability of the wave\nfunction in the EPR/B experiment dictates that the evolution of the\nparticles\u2019 trajectories, properties and dispositions is\nnon-separable, but the behavior of the particles is somewhat different.\nIn the earlier z-spin measurement on the L-particle, the\nquantum potential continuously changes, and this change induces an\nimmediate change in the z-spin of the R-particle. If the\nL-particle starts to spin \u2018up\u2019 (\u2018down\u2019) in the\nz-direction, the R-particle will start to spin\n\u2018down\u2019 (\u2018up\u2019) in the same direction (see the\nlittle arrows in Fig.\n 4).[20]\n Accordingly, the L-measurement induces instantaneous action at a\ndistance between the L- and the R-wing. Yet, similarly to the minimal\nBohm theory, while the disposition of the R-particle to emerge above\nor below the center plane aligned orthogonally to the\nz-direction in a z-spin measurement may change\ninstantaneously, the actual trajectory of the R-particle along the\nz-direction does not change before the measurement of the\nR-particle's z-spin occurs. Only during the R-measurement,\nthe spin and the position of the R-particle get correlated and the\nR-particle's trajectory along the z-direction is dictated by\nthe value of its (intrinsic) z-spin.\n\n\nVarious objections have been raised against Bohm's theory (for a\ndetailed list and replies, see the entry on Bohmian mechanics, section\n15). One main objection is that in Bohmian mechanics, the guiding\nfield influences the particles, but the particles do not influence the\nguiding field. Another common objection is that the theory is involved\nwith a radical type of non-locality, and that this type of\nnon-locality is incompatible with relativity. While it may be very\ndifficult, or even impossible, to reconcile Bohm's theory with\nrelativity, as is not difficult to see from the above discussion, the\ntype of non-locality that the minimal Bohm theory postulates in the\nEPR/B experiment does not seem more radical than the non-locality\npostulated by the orthodox interpretation and the GRW/Pearle collapse\nmodels.  \n5.3.2 Modal interpretations\n\n\nModal interpretations of quantum mechanics were designed to solve the\nmeasurement problem and to reconcile quantum mechanics with\nrelativity. They are no-collapse, (typically) indeterministic\nhidden-variables theories.  Quantum-mechanical states of systems\n(which may be construed as denoting their states or information about\nthese states) always evolve according to unitary and linear dynamical\nequations (the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the non-relativistic\ncase). And the orthodox quantum-mechanical state description of\nsystems is supplemented by a set of properties, which depends on the\nquantum-mechanical state and which is supposed to be rich enough to\naccount for the occurrence of definite macroscopic events and their\nclassical-like behavior, but sufficiently restricted to escape all the\nknown no-hidden-variables theorems. (For modal interpretations, see\nvan Fraassen 1973, 1981, 1991, chapter 9, Kochen 1985, Krips 1987,\nDieks 1988, 1989, Healey 1989, Bub 1992, 1994, 1997, Vermaas and Dieks\n1995, Clifton 1995, Bacciagaluppi 1996, Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo 1996,\nBub and Clifton 1996, Hemmo 1996b, Bacciagaluppi and Dickson 1999,\nClifton 2000, Spekkens and Sipe 2001a,b, Bene and Dieks 2002, and\nBerkovitz and Hemmo 2006a,b. For an entry-level review, see the entry\non modal interpretations of quantum theory. For comprehensive reviews\nand analyses of modal interpretations, see Bacciagaluppi 1996, Hemmo\n1996a, chapters 1-3, Dieks and Vermaas 1998, Vermaas 1999, and the\nentry on modal interpretations of quantum theory. For the\nno-hidden-variables theorems, see Kochen and Specker 1967,\nGreenberger, Horne and Zeilinger 1989, Mermin 1990 and the entry on\nthe Kochen-Specker \n theorem.)[21]\n\n\nModal interpretations vary in their property assignment. For\nsimplicity, we shall focus on modal interpretations in which the\nproperty assignment is based on the so-called Schmidt\nbiorthogonal-decomposition theorem (see Kochen 1985, Dieks 1989, and\nHealey 1989). Let S1 and S2 be\nsystems associated with the Hilbert spaces\nHS1 and\nHS2, respectively. There exist bases\n{|\u03b1i>} and\n{|\u03b2i>} for\nHS1 and\nHS2 respectively such that the state of\nS1+S2 can be expressed as a\nlinear combination of the following form of vectors from these\nbases:\n\n |\u03c88\n>S1+S2 =\n\u2211i ci\n|\u03b1i>S1 \n|\u03b2i>S2.\n\n\nWhen the absolute values of the coefficients ci\nare all unequal, the bases\n{|\u03b1i>} and\n{|\u03b2i>} and the above\ndecomposition of |\u03c88\n>S1+S2 are\nunique. In that case, it is postulated that S1 has\na determinate value for each observable associated with\nHS1 with the basis\n{|\u03b1i>} and\nS2 has a determinate value for each observable\nassociated with HS2 with the basis\n{|\u03b2i>}, and |ci|2\nprovide the (ignorance)\nprobabilities of the possible values that these observables may\n have.[22]\n For example, suppose that the state of the L- and the R-particle in\nthe EPR/B experiment before the measurements is:\n\n\n |\u03c89> = (1/\u221a2+\u03b5) \n|z-up>L|\nz-down>R \u2212 (1/\u221a2-\u03b5\u2032) \n|z-down>L|\nz-up>R \n\n\n\n\nwhere 1/\u221a2 >> \u03b5,\u03b5\u2032,\n(1/\u221a2+\u03b5)2+(1/\u221a2-\u03b5\u2032)2\n= 1, and (as before) |z-up>L\n(|z-up>R) and |\nz-down>L (|\nz-down>R) denote the states of the L- (R-)\nparticle having z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and z-spin \u2018down\u2019,\n respectively.[23]\n Then, either the L-particle spins \u2018up\u2019 and the R-particle\nspins \u2018down\u2019 in the z-direction, or the\nL-particle spins \u2018down\u2019 and the R-particle spins\n\u2018up\u2019 in the z-direction. Thus, in contrast to the\northodox interpretation and the GRW/Pearle collapse models, in modal\ninterpretations the particles in the EPR/B experiment may have\ndefinite spin properties even before any measurement occurs.\n\n\nTo see how the modal interpretation accounts for the curious\ncorrelations in EPR/B-type experiments, let us suppose that the state\nof the particle pair and the measurement apparatuses at the emission\ntime is:\n\n\n|\u03c810> = ((1/\u221a2+\u03b5)\n|z-up>L\n|z-down>R \u2212\n(1/\u221a2\u2212\u03b5\u2032)\n|z-down>L\n|z-up>R)\n|ready>AL|ready>AR\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere |ready>AL\n(|ready>AR) denotes the state of the\nL-apparatus (R-apparatus) being ready to measure z-spin. In\nthis state, the L- and the R-apparatus are in the definite state of\nbeing ready to measure z-spin, and (similarly to the state\n|\u03c89>) the L- and the R-particle have definite\nz-spin properties: Either the L-particle has z-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 and the R-particle has z-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 or the L-particle has z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 and the R-particle has z-spin\n \u2018up,\u2019[24] \n where the probability of the realization of each of these\npossibilities is approximately 1/2. In the (earlier) z-spin\nmeasurement on the L-particle, the state of the particle pair and the\napparatuses evolves to the state:\n\n\n |\u03c811> = ((1/\u221a2+\u03b5) \n|z-up>L|up>AL|\nz-down>R \u2212 (1/\u221a2-\u03b5\u2032) \n|z-down>L|down>AL|\nz-up>R) |ready>AR\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere (as before) |up>AL and\n|down>AL denote the states of the L-apparatus\npointing to the outcomes z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019, respectively. In this state,\neither the L-particle has a z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the\nL-apparatus points to \u2018up,\u2019 or the L-particle has\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019 and the L-apparatus points to\n\u2018down.\u2019 And, again, the probability of each of these\npossibilities is approximately 1/2. The evolution of the properties\nfrom the state |\u03c810> to the state\n|\u03c811> depends on the dynamical laws. In almost all\nmodal interpretations, if the particles have definite z-spin\nproperties before the measurements, the outcomes of z-spin\nmeasurements will reflect these properties. That is, the evolution of\nthe properties of the particles and the measurement apparatuses will\nbe deterministic, so that the spin properties of the particles do not\nchange in the L-measurement and the pointer of the L-apparatus comes\nto display the outcome that corresponds to the z-spin\nproperty that the L-particle had before the measurement. If, for\nexample, before the measurements the L- and the R-particle have\nrespectively the properties z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019, the (earlier) z-spin\nmeasurement on the L-particle will yield the outcome \u2018up\u2019\nand the spin properties of the particles will remain\nunchanged. Accordingly, a z-spin measurement on the\nR-particle will yield the outcome \u2018down\u2019. Thus, in this\ncase the modal interpretation involves neither action at a distance\nnor action* at a distance.\n\n\nHowever, if the measurement apparatuses are set up to measure\nx-spin rather than z-spin, the evolution of the\nproperties of the L-particle and the L-apparatus will be\nindeterministic. As before, the L-measurement will not cause any change\nin the actual spin properties of the R-particle. But the L-measurement\noutcome will cause an instant change in the spin dispositions of the\nR-particle and the R-measurement apparatus. If, for example, the\nL-measurement outcome is x-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the\nL-particle comes to posses x-spin \u2018up,\u2019 then the\nR-particle and the R-apparatus will have respectively\nthe dispositions to possess x-spin \u2018down\u2019 and to\ndisplay the outcome x-spin \u2018down\u2019 on a\nx-spin measurement. Thus, like the minimal Bohm theory, the\nmodal interpretation may involve action* at a distance in the EPR/B\nexperiment. But, unlike the minimal Bohm theory, here spins are\nintrinsic properties of particles.\n\n\nIn the above modal interpretation, property composition fails: The\nproperties of composite systems are not decomposable into the\nproperties of their subsystems. Consider, again, the state\n|\u03c810>. As \u2018separated\u2019 systems (i.e.,  in\nthe decompositions of the composite system of the particle\npair+apparatuses into the L-particle and the R-particle+apparatuses\nand into the R-particle and the L-particle+apparatuses) the L- and the\nR-particle have definite z-spin properties. But, as\nsubsystems of the composite system of the particle pair (e.g. in the\ndecomposition of the composite system of the particle pair+apparatuses\ninto the particle pair and the apparatuses), they have no definite\nz-spin properties.\n\n\nA failure of property composition occurs also in the state \n|\u03c811>, where the L- and the R-particle have\ndefinite z-spin properties both as \u2018separated\u2019\nsystems and as subsystems of the particle pair (though in contrast with \n|\u03c810>, in |\u03c811> the range\nof the possible properties of the particles as separated systems and\nas subsystems of the pair is the same). For nothing in the above property\nassignment implies that in |\u03c811> the spin\nproperties that the L-particle has as a \u2018separated\u2019 system\nand the spin properties that it has as a subsystem of the particle pair\nbe the same: The L-particle may have z-spin \u2018up\u2019\nas a separated system and z-spin \u2018down\u2019 as a\nsubsystem of the particle pair.\n\n\nFurthermore, the dynamics of the properties that the L-particle\n(R-particle) has as a separated system and the dynamics of its\nproperties as a subsystem of the particle pair are generally\n different.[25]\n Consider, again, the state |\u03c810>. In the (earlier)\nz-spin measurement on the L-particle, the spin properties\nthat the L-particle has as a separated system follow a deterministic\nevolution \u2014 the L-particle has either z-spin\n\u2018up\u2019 or z-spin \u2018down\u2019 before and\nafter the L-measurement; whereas as a subsystem of the particle pair,\nthe spin properties of the L-particle follow an indeterministic\nevolution \u2014 the L-particle has no definite spin properties\nbefore the L-measurement and either z-spin \u2018up\u2019\n(with approximately chance \u00bd) or z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 (with approximately chance \u00bd) after the\nL-measurement.\n\n\nThe failure of property composition implies that the quantum realm as\ndepicted by the above version of the modal interpretation involves\nstate non-separability and property and relational holism. State\nseparability fails because the state of the particle pair is not\ngenerally determined by the separate states of the particles. Indeed,\nas is easily shown, the actual properties that the L- and the\nR-particle each has in the state |\u03c89> are also\ncompatible with product states in which the L- and the R-particle are\nnot entangled. Property and relational holism fail because in the\nstate |\u03c89> the properties of the pair do not\nsupervene upon the properties of its subsystems and the spatiotemporal\nrelations between them. Furthermore, process separability fails for\nsimilar reasons. \n\n\nThe failure of property composition in the modal interpretation\ncalls for explanation. It may be tempting to postulate that the\nproperties that a system (e.g. the L-particle) has, as a separated\nsystem, are the same as the properties that it has as a subsystem of\ncomposite systems. But, as Bacciagaluppi (1995) and Clifton (1996a)\nhave shown, such property assignment will be inconsistent: It will be\nsubject to a Kochen and Specker-type contradiction. Furthermore, as\nVermaas (1997) demonstrates, the properties of composite systems and\nthe properties of their subsystems cannot be correlated (in ways\ncompatible with the Born rule).\n\n\nFor what follows in the rest of this subsection, the views of\ndifferent authors differ widely. Several variants of modal\ninterpretations were developed in order to fix the problem of the\nfailure of property composition. The most natural explanation of the\nfailure of property composition is that quantum states assign\nrelational rather than intrinsic properties to systems (see Kochen\n1985, Bene and Dieks 2002, and Berkovitz and Hemmo 2006a,b). For\nexample, in the relational modal interpretation proposed by Berkovitz\nand Hemmo (2006a,b), the main idea is that quantum states assign\nproperties to systems only relative to other systems, and properties\nof a system that are related to different systems are generally\ndifferent. In particular, in the state |\u03c810> the\nL-particle has a definite z-spin property relative to the\nR-particle, the measurement apparatuses and the rest of the universe,\nbut (as a subsystem of the particle pair) it has no definite\nz-spin relative to the measurement apparatuses and the rest\nof\n universe.[26]\n On this interpretation, the properties of systems are highly\nnon-local by their very nature.  Properties like pointing to\n\u2018up\u2019 and pointing to \u2018down\u2019 are not intrinsic\nto the measurement apparatuses.  Rather, they are relations between\nthe apparatuses and other systems.  For example, the property of the\nL-apparatus pointing to \u2018up\u2019 relative to the particle\npair, the R-apparatus and the rest of the universe is not intrinsic to\nthe L-apparatus; it is a relation between the L-apparatus and the\nparticle pair, the R-apparatus and the rest of the universe. As such,\nthis property is highly non-local: It is located in neither the L-wing\nnor any other subregion of the universe. Yet, due to the dynamical\nlaws, properties like the position of pointers of measurement\napparatuses, which appear to us to be local, behave like local\nproperties in any experimental circumstances, and accordingly this\nradical type of non-locality is unobservable (for more details, see\nBerkovitz and Hemmo 2006b, sections 8.1 and 9).\n\n\nAnother way to try to explain the failure of property composition is\nto interpret the properties of composite systems as holistic,\nnon-decomposable properties. On this interpretation, the\nz-spin \u2018up\u2019 property that the L-particle has as a\nsubsystem of the particle pair in the state |\u03c89> is\ncompletely different from the z-spin \u2018up\u2019\nproperty that the L-particle has as a separated system, and the use of\nthe term \u2018z-spin up\u2019 in both cases is misleading\n(for more details, see Berkovitz and Hemmo \n 2006a).[27]\n\n\nThe relational and holistic interpretations of properties mark a\nradical shift from the standard interpretation of properties in\northodox quantum mechanics. Other advocates of the modal interpretation\nhave chosen not to follow this interpretation, and opted for a modal\ninterpretation that does not violate property composition. While the\nproperty assignment above does not assume any preferred partition of\nthe universe (the partition of the universe into a particle pair and\nthe rest of the universe is as good as the partition of the universe\ninto the L-particle and the rest of the universe), proponents of\nproperty composition postulated that there is a preferred partition of\nthe universe into \u2018atomic\u2019 systems and accordingly a\npreferred factorization of the Hilbert space of the universe. This\npreferred factorization is supposed to be the basis for the\n\u2018core\u2019 property assignment: Properties are prescribed to\natomic systems according to a property assignment that is a\ngeneralization of the bi-orthogonal decomposition property\n assignment.[28]\n And the properties of complex systems are postulated to be\ncompositions of the properties of their atomic systems (see the entry\non modal interpretations of quantum theory, section 2, and\nBacciagaluppi and Dickson 1999). The challenge for this atomic modal\ninterpretation is to justify the assumption that there is a preferred\npartition of the universe, and to provide some idea about how such\nfactorization should look like.\n\n\nFinally, while the modal interpretation was designed to solve the\nmeasurement problem and reconcile quantum mechanics with special\nrelativity, it faces challenges on both accounts.  First, in certain\nimprefect measurements (where there are imprefections in the coupling\nbetween the measured system and the pointer of the measurement\napparatus and/or the pointer and the environment), modal\ninterpretations that are based on the Schmidt\nbiorthogonal-decomposition theorem (and more generally the spectral\ndecomposition theorem) fail to account for definite measurement\noutcomes, in contradiction to our experience (see Bacciagaluppi and\nHemmo 1996 and Bacciagaluppi 2000). For versions of the modal\ninterpretations that seem to escape this problem, see Van Fraassen\n(1973, 1991), Bub (1992, 1997), Bene and Dieks (2002) and Berkovitz\nand Hemmo (2006a,b). Second, as we shall see in section 10.2, a number\nof no-go theorems challenge the view that modal interpretations could\nbe genuinely relativistic.\n5.3.3 Everett-like interpretations\n\n\nIn 1957, Everett proposed a new no-collapse interpretation of orthodox\nquantum mechanics (see Everett 1957a,b, 1973, Barrett 1999, the entry\non Everett's relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics, the\nentry on the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and\nreferences therein). The Everett interpretation is a no-collapse\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, where the evolution of quantum\nstates is always according to unitary and linear dynamical equations\n(the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the non-relativistic case). In this\ninterpretation, quantum states are fundamentally relative. Systems have\nrelative states, which are derivable from the various branches of the\nentangled states. For example, consider again |\u03c811>. \n\n\n |\u03c811> = (1/\u221a2+\u03b5) \n|z-up>L|up>AL|\nz-down>R |ready>AR\n\u2212 (1/\u221a2-\u03b5\u2032) \n|z-down>L|down>AL|\nz-up>R |ready>AR.\n \n\n\n\n\nIn this quantum-mechanical state, the L-apparatus is in the state of\npointing to the outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019\nrelative to the L-particle being in the state z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 the R-particle being in the state z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 and the R-apparatus being ready to measure\nz-spin; and in the state of pointing to the outcome\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019 relative to the L-particle\nbeing in the state z-spin \u2018down,\u2019 the R-particle\nbeing in the state z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the\nR-apparatus being ready to measure z-spin. Likewise, the\nL-particle is in the state z-spin \u2018up\u2019 relative\nto the L-apparatus being in the state of pointing to the outcome\nz-spin \u2018up,\u2019 the R-particle being in the state\nz-spin \u2018down\u2019 and the R-apparatus being ready to\nmeasure z-spin; and in the state z-spin\n\u2018down\u2019 relative to the L-apparatus being in the state of\npointing to the outcome z-spin \u2018down,\u2019 the\nR-particle being in the state z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the\nR-apparatus being ready to measure z-spin. And similarly,\nmutatis mutandis, for the relative state of the R-particle\nand the R-apparatus.\n\n\nEverett's original formulation left the exact meaning of these\nrelative states and their relations to observers\u2019 experience and\nbeliefs open, and there have been different Everett-like\ninterpretations of these states. Probably the most popular reading of\nEverett is the splitting-worlds interpretation (see DeWitt 1971,\nEverett's relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics, Barrett\n1999, and references therein). In the splitting-worlds interpretation,\neach of the branches of the state |\u03c811> refers to a\ndifferent class of worlds (all of which are real) where the states of\nthe L-apparatus, R-apparatus and the particles are all separable:\nClass-1 worlds in which the L-particle is in the state z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 the R-particle is in the state z-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 the L-apparatus is in the state of pointing to the\noutcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019 and the R-apparatus in the\nstate of being ready to measure z-spin; and class-2 worlds in\nwhich the L-particle is in the state z-spin\n\u2018down,\u2019 the R-particle is in the state z-spin\n\u2018up,\u2019 the L-apparatus is in the state of pointing to the\noutcome z-spin \u2018down\u2019 and the R-apparatus is in\nthe state of being ready to measure z-spin. More generally,\neach term in state of the universe, as represented in a certain\npreferred basis, reflects the states of its systems in some class of\nworlds; where the range of the different classes of worlds increases\nwhenever the number of the terms in the quantum state (in the\npreferred basis) increases (this process is called\n\u2018splitting\u2019).\n\n\nThe splitting-worlds reading of Everett faces a number of challenges.\nFirst, supporters of the Everett interpretation frequently motivate\ntheir interpretation by arguing that it postulates the existence of\nneither a controversial wave collapse nor hidden variables, and it\nleaves the simple and elegant mathematical structure of quantum\nmechanics intact. But, the splitting-worlds interpretation adds extra\nstructure to no-collapse orthodox quantum mechanics. Further, this\ninterpretation marks a radical shift from orthodox quantum\nmechanics. A scientific theory is not constituted only by its\nmathematical formalism, but also by the ontology it postulates, the\nway it depicts the physical realm and the way it accounts for our\nexperience. The many parallel worlds ontology of the splitting-worlds\ninterpretation and its account of our experience are radically\ndifferent from the ontology of the intended interpretation of orthodox\nquantum mechanics and its account for our experience. Second, relative\nstates are well defined in any basis, and the question arises as to\nwhich basis should be preferred and the motivation for selecting one\nparticular basis over others.  Third, in the splitting-worlds\ninterpretation each of the worlds in the universe may split into two\nor more worlds, and the problem is that (similarly to the collapse in\northodox collapse quantum mechanics) there are no clear criteria for\nwhen a splitting occurs and how long it takes. Fourth, there is the\nquestion of how the splitting-worlds interpretation accounts for the\nstatistical predictions of the orthodox theory. In the Everett-like\ninterpretations in general, and in the splitting-worlds interpretation\nin particular, all the possible measurement outcomes in the EPR/B\nexperiment are realized and may be observed.  Thus, the question\narises as to the meaning of probabilities in this interpretation. For\nexample, what is the meaning of the statement that in the state\n|\u03c810> (see section 5.3.2) the probability of the\nL-measurement apparatus pointing to the outcome \u2018up\u2019 in an\nearlier z-spin measurement on the L-particle is\n(approximately) \u00bd? In the splitting-worlds interpretation the\nprobability of that outcome appears to be 1! Furthermore, setting\naside the problem of interpretation, there is also the question of\nwhether the splitting-worlds interpretation, and more generally\nEverett-like interpretations, can account for the particular values of\nthe quantum probabilities of measurement outcomes. Everett claimed to\nderive the Born probabilities in the context of his\ninterpretation. But this derivation has been controversial. (For\ndiscussions of the meaning of probabilities, or more precisely the\nmeaning of the coefficients of the various terms in quantum states, in\nEverett-like interpretations, see Butterfield 1996, Lockwood 1996a,b,\nSaunders 1998, Vaidman 1998, Barnum et al. 2000, Bacciagaluppi 2002,\nGill 2003, Hemmo and Pitowsky 2003, 2005, Wallace 2002, 2003, 2005a,b,\nGreaves 2004 and Saunders 2004, 2005.) \n\n\nOther readings of Everett include the many-minds interpretation\n(Albert and Loewer 1988, Barrett 1999, chapter 7), the\nconsistent-histories approach (Gell-Mann and Hartle 1990), the\nEverett-like relational interpretation (Saunders 1995, Mermin 1998)\nand (what may be called) the many-structures interpretation (Wallace\n2005c). While these readings address more or less successfully the\nproblems of the preferred basis and splitting, except for the\nmany-minds interpretation of Albert and Loewer the question of whether\nthere could be a satisfactory interpretation of probabilities in the\ncontext of these theories and the adequacy of the derivation of the\nBorn probabilities are still a controversial issue (see Deutsch 1999,\nWallace 2002, 2003, Lewis 2003, Graves 2004, Saunders 2004, Hemmo and\nPitowsky 2005, and Price 2006).\n\n\nWhat kind of non-locality do Everett-like interpretations involve?\nUnfortunately, the answer to this question is not straightforward, as\nit depends on one's particular reading of the Everett\ninterpretation. Indeed, all the above readings of Everett seem to treat\nthe no-collapse wave function of the universe as a real physical entity\nthat reflects the non-separable state of the universe, and accordingly\nthey involve state non-separability. But, one may reasonably expect\nthat different readings depict different pictures of physical reality\nand accordingly might postulate different kinds of non-locality. Thus,\nany further analysis of the type of non-locality postulated by each of\nthese readings requires a detailed study of their ontology (which we\nplan to conduct in future updates of this entry).\n\n\nFor example, the question of action at a distance in the EPR/B\nexperiment may arise in the context of the splitting-worlds interpretation,\nbut not in the context of Albert and Loewer's many-minds\ninterpretation. Albert and Loewer's interpretation takes the bare\nno-collapse orthodox quantum mechanics to be the complete theory of the\nphysical realm. Accordingly, the L-apparatus in the state \n|\u03c811> does not display any definite outcome. Yet,\nin order to account for our experience of a classical-like world, where\nat the end of measurements observers are typically in mental states of\nperceiving definite outcomes, the many-minds interpretation appeals to\na dualism of mind-body. Each observer is associated with a continuous\ninfinity of non-physical minds. And while the physical state of the\nworld evolves in a completely deterministic manner according to the\nSchr\u00f6dinger evolution, and the pointers of the measurement\napparatuses in the EPR/B experiment display no definite outcomes,\nstates of minds evolve in a genuinely indeterministic fashion so as to\nyield an experience of perceiving definite measurement outcomes. For\nexample, consider again, the state |\u03c810>. While\nin a first z-spin L-measurement, this state evolves\ndeterministically into the state |\u03c811>, minds of\nobservers evolve indeterministically into either the state of\nperceiving the outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019 or the state of\nperceiving the outcome z-spin \u2018down\u2019 with the\nusual Born-rule probabilities (approximately 50% chance for each of\nthese outcomes). Since in this state the L-particle has no definite\nspin properties and the L-apparatus points to no definite measurement\noutcome, and since in the later z-spin measurement on the\nR-particle the R-particle does not come to possess any definite spin\nproperties and the R-apparatus points to no definite spin outcome, the\nquestion of whether there is action at a distance between the L-particle and the\nL-apparatus on the one hand and the R-particle and the R-apparatus on\nthe other does not arise.\n",
