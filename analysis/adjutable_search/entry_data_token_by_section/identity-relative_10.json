    "main_text": "The Paradoxes Reconsidered\n4. The Paradoxes Reconsidered\n\nLet us look back at the paradoxes of identity outlined in \u00a72 from\nthe perspective of the weak view regarding relative identity. That\nview allows that absolutely distinct objects may be the same \\(F\\),\nbut denies that absolutely identical objects can be different\n\\(G\\)\u2019s. This implies that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are relatively\ndifferent objects, then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely distinct, and\nhence only pairs of absolutely distinct objects can satisfy RI. If\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely distinct, we shall say that \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are distinct \u201clogical objects\u201d; and similarly, if\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely identical objects, then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nare identical logical objects. The term \u201clogical object\u201d\ndoes not stand for some new and special kind of thing. Absolutely\ndistinct apples, for example, are distinct logical objects.\n\nThe following is the barest sketch of relativist solutions to the\nparadoxes of identity discussed in \u00a72. No attempt is made to\nfully justify any proposed solution, though a modicum of justification\nemerges in the course of \u00a76. It should be kept in mind that some\nof the strength of the relativist solutions derives from the\nweaknesses of the absolutist alternatives, some of which are discussed\nin \u00a72.\n",
