    "main_text": "Psychology and Cognition || Intuitive and Abstractive Cognition\n4.1 Intuitive and Abstractive Cognition\n\nWodeham turns first to the question of intuitive and abstractive\ncognition: two concepts developed by John Duns Scotus and William of\nOckham. But while they identify the parallel notions of intuitive and\nabstractive cognition proper to the sensitive and intellective souls\nrespectively, Wodeham distinguishes himself from his predecessors by\ninsisting that this parallel reduplication is redundant and violates\nthe principle of parsimony.\n\nRegarding intuitive cognition Wodeham begins by stating that:\n\u201cevery act of science naturally caused presupposes evidence of\nsome proposition or of the thing signified through the proposition.\nScience (or a scientific act of assent) is caused by the mediation of\nthis evidence\u201d (LS I:9, ll. 44\u201346).\n\nThe question is: what is the source of this evidence? The assumption\nis that an evident proposition arises from, or is formulated from,\ncertain types of simple evident apprehensions, namely, intuitive\napprehensions. Wodeham, then asks: does the intellect require an\nintuitive apprehension distinct from the act of sensation?\n\nThe definition of intuitive apprehension states that such an\napprehension must be sufficient for the intellect to make a judgment\nabout the existence of the object. Given this definition Wodeham\nwonders why a second act of intuitive apprehension, beyond the\napprehension of sensation, is necessary in order for the intellect to\nmake this judgment. The fact that the present object in question has\nbeen \u201csensed\u201d ought to be sufficient for the intellect to\nfeel confident that such an object exists.\n\nWodeham\u2019s position is distinctive because he denies what was a\ntraditional distinction for Scotus and Ockham, namely, a distinction\nbetween the sensitive and intellective soul (a real distinction in the\ncase of Ockham and a formal distinction in the case of Scotus). For\nWodeham, the assumption of two separate acts of intuition mandates\nthat a human being have either two souls or that the human has one\nsoul and also another vital power, separate from that soul. But,\ndrawing on the authority of Augustine, Wodeham identifies the notion\nof two souls as a heresy to be avoided. Another option is to think\nthat the sensitive soul is not really a soul at all, but rather a\npower distinct and separate from the one human soul. But this too is\nunacceptable. To be a true sensitive potency, Wodeham insists that it\nmust be a living form (viva forma); if it were not, it would\nnot be able to receive \u201cliving\u201d or vital acts, among which\napprehensive and appetitive acts are numbered. But if one admits that\nthe sensitive power remains a \u201cliving form\u201d, then two\nsouls are once more introduced into the single human being. This, at\nleast, is the case for Wodeham, who holds that to be a\n\u201csoul\u201d is to be a \u201cliving form\u201d (LS I:11, ll.\n44\u201355). Thus, Wodeham is adamant that there can only be one soul\nin the single human being, and the intuitive act of sensation alone is\nsufficient for the simple apprehension \u201cpresupposed\u201d by an\n\u201cevident assent\u201d (LS I:9, ll. 44\u201348). However, by\ndenying this distinction, Wodeham must be willing to say that,\nstrictly speaking, the \u201cintellect senses\u201d because it is\nthe same intellectual soul that both senses and thinks. This was an\nunsavory consequence for a thinker like Ockham, but one that Wodeham\nwas fully willing to accept (Wood 1990, 21*; LS I:14\u201315,\nll.1\u201349).\n\nDespite disagreeing with Scotus and Ockham on the nature of the\nintellective and the sensitive soul, Wodeham affirms the formal\ndefinition of intuition originally given by Scotus. This definition is\nformulated in the third conclusion of the second question of the\nprologue to the Lectura Secunda: \u201cthe incomplex act,\nwhich is able to cause evident assent about a contingent truth of a\npresent object, and which naturally requires the existence and\npresence of that object, is intuitive knowledge\u201d (LS I, 37, ll.\n69\u201372). The presence of the object is required and not just its\nexistence because intuitive cognition requires the object to function\nas an efficient cause. The object, however, cannot function as an\nefficient cause unless it is also present to the knower (LS\nI:45\u201346, ll. 40\u201344).\n\nWith this definition Wodeham is also rejecting an important and\ncontroversial part of Ockham\u2019s definition of intuitive\nknowledge. For Ockham, not only was an intuitive knowledge able to\nproduce an affirmative judgment of the existence of an extant object,\nbut it was also able to affirm the non-existence of a non-extant\nobject. By insisting on the criteria of a present object for any kind\nof intuitive knowledge, Wodeham denies that an intuition of a\nnon-extant, non-present object is possible. Here Wodeham offers an\nillustrative example. He remarks that sometimes we can judge that\nsomething does not exist as a consequence of having a positive\nintuition. He gives the example of intuitively seeing the dead body of\nSocrates and knowing that Socrates does not exist. While\nacknowledging that such an example might be the inspiration behind\nOckham\u2019s controversial claim about an intuitive knowledge of\nnon-existents, he points out that in this example, we do not have an\nintuitive knowledge of the same thing about which we are making a\njudgment. Rather we are making an inference from our intuitive\nknowledge of (and a judgment about) the existence of the dead body of\nSocrates (LS I:38\u201339, ll. 4\u201315).\n\nThe difference, then, between intuitive knowledge and abstractive\nknowledge is again taken from Scotus. Here, in Wodeham\u2019s sixth\nconclusion, of the second question, the difference is attributable,\nnot to diverse objects of knowledge, but to the attitude that one can\ntake towards that object with respect to existence (LS I:45, ll.\n22\u201326). Unlike intuitive knowledge, abstractive knowledge does\nnot require the existence or presence of the object to be known.\nHowever, in this case \u201cwhat is known\u201d is indifferent to\nthe existence of that object and no judgment about that object\u2019s\nexistence can be made.\n",
