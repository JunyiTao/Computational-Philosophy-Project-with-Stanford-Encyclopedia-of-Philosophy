    "main_text": "\n\n\nGlobal democracy is a field of academic study and political activism\nconcerned with making the global political system more\ndemocratic. This topic has become a central area of inquiry for\nestablished literatures including political philosophy, international\nrelations (IR), international law, and sociology. Along with global\njustice, global democracy has also been critical to the emergence of\ninternational political theory as a discrete literature in recent\ndecades. Whereas global justice scholars tend to focus on how burdens\nand benefits should be distributed by international institutions,\nglobal democrats probe how political power can be legitimated beyond\nthe nation-state. Global democracy is therefore concerned with how\ntransnational decision-making can be justified and who should be\nentitled to participate in the formation of global rules, laws, and\nregulations.\n\n\nThis short entry contains four sections which elaborate upon the\npossibility and problems for global democracy. The first discusses how\nglobalization impacts upon the nation-state and what this means for\ntraditional conceptions of democracy. The notion of a global\ndemocratic deficit\u2014in which individuals are removed from\ntransnational decision-making in problematic ways\u2014is introduced,\nand reasons to pursue global democracy are fleshed out. The second\nsection outlines some prominent normative proposals for global\ndemocracy. Specifically, five \u2018models of global democracy\u2019\nare presented and some general criticisms are formulated. The third\nsection then highlights the recent turn toward pursuing \u2018values\nof democratization\u2019. This new direction for the literature has\nboth methodological and substantive implications. The final section\nhighlights persistent criticisms that should be addressed in future\nresearch on global democracy.\n",
