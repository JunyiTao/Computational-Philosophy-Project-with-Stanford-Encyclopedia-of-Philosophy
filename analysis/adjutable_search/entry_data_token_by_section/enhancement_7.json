Do Enhancements Compromise Authenticity?\nThe intuitive worry of authors who take this question seriously is that\nbiomedical enhancements might not only create corrosive short-cuts\nwithin valuable social practices, but also rob those who use them of\nthings they otherwise cherish about themselves\u2014endurance,\ndetermination, growth, faith, even luck\u2014by substituting \u201chollow\nvictories\u201d for authentic achievements. Losing the\nexperience of authentic achievements, in turn, diminishes the character\nof the user (Sandel 2007), alienating them from themselves and those\naround them (Agar 2013), and diminishing bonds of solidarity with\nnon-users (Sparrow 2014). Unpacking this intuitive concern into\narguments can take multiple paths.  It matters, for example,\nwhether the actors are parents enhancing their children or adults\nenhancing themselves (Habermas 2003), and whether accepted therapeutic\nuses of the same tools should face the same critique (Elliott\n2011).\nIn order to decide whether particular enhancements compromise\nauthenticity in the ways that these authors suggest, it is important to\nbe clear about what kinds of things are the appropriate targets of\nattributions of authenticity. Do enhancements undermine the\nauthenticity of one\u2019s self, agency, achievements or actions?\nAuthenticity is widely understood to be a matter of being \u201ctrue\nto oneself\u201d. Many authors in these debates do not take the time\nto carefully explicate their assumptions about \u201cthe self\u201d and what it\ntakes to be \u201ctrue to\u201d it. It is, of course, a challenge to\ncharacterize the self to which authentic individuals are true\n(Trilling, 1971; Taylor 1991; Guignon 2004). If there is a self,\nthen there are difficult synchronic identification questions (i.e., at\na given time, what features are constitutive of an agent?) and\ndiachronic identification questions (i.e., across time, what features\nmust persist in order for the self to survive?) that must be resolved.\nDerek Parfit, working in a tradition of \u201cbundle theories of the\nself\u201d, articulated the influential position that a person is\nnothing over and above a series of person-stages that are linked across\ntime by certain psychological continuity relations (Parfit 1984). Given\nthe controversy surrounding these debates about the nature of persons\nand personal identity, it is no surprise that there is little consensus\nabout whether enhancements undermine authenticity of the self.\nIn the enhancement debate it is important to distinguish the\nconcerns and the arguments that are provided for and against the moral\nand ethical significance of various types of enhancement. In this\nparticular domain, the rhetoric is often intense and feverish and it\nis important to be mindful of whether one is examining a\nconcern or an argument about the moral\npermissibility of a particular kind of enhancement (Buchanan\n2011). While evaluating these authenticity concerns, it is helpful to\nbear in mind the scope of the authenticity concern under\nscrutiny. That is, it is important to be clear about whether the\nauthenticity concern that is being expressed purports to (1)\u00a0show\nthat all enhancements are immoral, (2)\u00a0show that most\nenhancements are immoral, or (3)\u00a0show that a particular\nenhancement is, or would be, immoral (Buchanan 2011).\nOne style of argument for the claim that enhancements undermine\nauthenticity is to contend that we could claim no personal credit for\naccomplishments that are the result of biomedical enhancements,\nbecause the biomedical interventions that caused improvements in our\ncapacities would supersede our own agency in authoring the achievement\n(Sandel 2007). Defenders of this perspective argue that while, for\nexample, education, training, and practice proceed through\n\u201cspeech and deeds\u201d that are comprehensible by those who\nare learning a new skill, when biomedical enhancements are used they\nhave \u201ctheir effects on a subject who is not merely passive but\nwho plays no role at all. In addition, he can at best feel their\neffects without understanding their meaning in human terms\u201d\n(Kass 2003, 22). One reply to this argument is that if one has freely\nchosen to use an enhancement on the basis of \u201cspeech and\ndeeds\u201d, it is unclear how those enhancements are passive or less\nauthentic than traditional methods of improving one\u2019s capacities\n(Kamm 2005).  Moreover, just as we hold those with enhanced abilities\nto higher standards of responsibility for negligence and harm (Mehlman\n2003), our expectations for enhanced achievements may be\ncorrespondingly high (Carter and Pritchard 2019). But in both\nsituations neither the enhanced actors\u2019 agency in improving\nthemselves nor their authorship of the results seems to be in question\n(Cole-Turner 1998).\nOther critics of biomedical enhancements that appeal to\nconsiderations of authenticity acknowledge that enhanced individuals\ndo author their accomplishments, but question whether those successes\ncarry the same value as \u201cauthentic\u201d unenhanced\nachievements (Habermas 2003; Sandel 2007; Bublitz and Merkel\n2009). They maintain that when a marathon runner gains endurance\nchemically rather than through training, or when a mystic gains\nNirvana through psychosurgery rather than meditation, each misses the\npoint of these types of accomplishments. In the cases of marathon\nrunning and meditation, the outcomes of the activity cannot be\nseparated from the activity itself: the value of the accomplishment\nlies in the personal activities they reward as well as the benefits\nthey bring (Schermer 2008a; Spitzley 2018). However, even if these\ncriticisms show that authentic, unenhanced achievements are valuable\nfor reasons that do not apply to the enhanced achievement, they do not\nshow that the unenhanced approach is, overall, better. Such criticisms\nmerely establish that the two are valued differently. It is still\npossible that the enhanced achievement may have its own distinctive\ntype of value. As the history shows, the character-building struggles\nthat we admire seem adept at keeping pace with our tools.  Legend has\nit that Celtic warriors eschewed body armor (and even clothing!) in\nbattle because they thought it diminished the glory of a true\nvictory. Some authors used to insist that keyboards corrupt the\nwriting process.  According to this historical narrative, biomedical\nenhancements have provided humans with important tools for\nself-creation that should be embraced (DeGrazia 2000; Agar 2004).\nAnother set of authenticity concerns arises in arguments that focus\non enhancement interventions performed by parents in conceiving and\nraising their children (Habermas 2003). Here, the claim is that\noffspring who have no agency in deciding whether or not to be enhanced\nare (existentially) cheated of their authentic identities and the\nautonomy to create themselves as others normally do. Taken literally,\nthis argument runs into the logical problems of identity that plague\n\u201cwrongful birth\u201d suits in the law (these children have no\nprior identity to lose), and depends on too extreme a version of\ngenetic or biological determinism to be credible, given the plausible\ncausal efficacy of any of the possible enhanced interventions under\ndiscussion (these children\u2019s futures are no more restricted than\nany other participant in the natural genetic lottery) (Buchanan 2011).\nAs a result, a more common approach is to use such claims to draw\nattention to parental or social attitudes about procreation and\nparenting that seem morally problematic, whether or not their offspring\nare directly harmed or wronged by being enhanced (Davis, 2010)\nEvaluating these arguments also requires one to get clear about the\nnature and scope of the moral right to be a parent and the duties of\nparents to their children (LaFollette 1980; Liao 2006a).\n",
