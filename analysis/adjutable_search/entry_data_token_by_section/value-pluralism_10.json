    "main_text": "Monist Solutions || Preference Satisfaction Views\n3.4 Preference Satisfaction Views\n\nThere is a different account of value that we ought to consider here:\nthe view that value consists in preference or desire satisfaction. On\nthis view, knowledge and pleasure and so on are valuable when they are\ndesired, and if they are not desired anymore they are not valuable\nanymore. There is no need to appeal to complicated accounts of\ndiminishing marginal utility: it is uncontroversial that we sometimes\ndesire something and sometimes don\u2019t. Thus complexities in\nchoices are explained by complexities in our desires, and it is\nuncontroversial that our desires are complex.\n\nImagine a one person preference satisfaction account of value that\nsays simply that what is valuable is what P desires.\nApparently this view is foundationally monist: there is only one thing\nthat confers value (being desired by P), yet at the\nnon-foundational level there are many values (whatever P\ndesires). Let us say that P desires hot baths, donuts and\nknowledge. The structure of P\u2019s desires is such that\nthere is a complicated ranking of these things, which will vary from\ncircumstance to circumstance. The ranking is not explained by the\nvalue of the objects,rather, her desire explains the ranking and\ndetermines the value of the objects. So it might be that P\nsometimes desires a hot bath and a donut equally, and cannot choose\nbetween them; it might be that sometimes she would choose knowledge\nover a hot bath and a donut, but sometimes she would choose a hot bath\nover knowledge. On James Griffin\u2019s slightly more complex view,\nwell-being consist in the fulfillment of informed desire, and Griffin\npoints out that his view can explain discontinuities in value without\nhaving to appeal to diminishing marginal utility:\n\nthere may well turn out to be cases in which, when informed, I want,\nsay, a certain amount of one thing more than any amount of another,\nand not because the second thing cloys, and so adding to it merely\nproduces diminishing marginal values. I may want it even though the\nsecond thing does not, with addition, lose its value; it may be that I\nthink that no increase in that kind of value, even if constant and\npositive, can overtake a certain amount of this kind of value. (1986,\np. 76).\n\n\nThis version of foundational monism/normative pluralism escapes some\nof the problems that attend the goods approach. First, this view can\naccount for deep complexities in choice. The plural goods that P is\nchoosing between do not seem merely instrumental. Donuts are not good\nbecause they contribute to another value, and P does not desire donuts\nfor any reason other than their donuty nature. On this view, if it is\nhard to choose between donuts and hot baths it is because of the\nintrinsic nature of the objects. The key here is that value is\nconferred by desire, not by contribution to another value. Second,\nthis view can accommodate incomparabilities: if P desires a hot bath\nbecause of its hot bathy nature, and a donut because of its donuty\nnature, she may not be able to choose between them.\n\nHowever, it is not entirely clear that a view like Griffin\u2019s is\ngenuinely monist at the foundational level: the question arises, what\nis constraining the desires that qualify as value conferring? If the\nanswer is \u2018nothing\u2019, then the view seems genuinely monist,\nbut is probably implausible. Unconstrained desire accounts of value\nseem implausible because our desires can be for all sorts of\nthings\u2014we may desire things that are bad for us, or we may\ndesire things because of some mistake we have made. If the answer is\nthat there is something constraining the desires that count as value\nconferring, then of course the question is, \u2018what?\u2019 Is it\nthe values of the things desired? A desire satisfaction view that\nrestricts the qualifying desires must give an account of what\nrestricts them, and obviously, the account may commit the view to\nfoundational pluralism.\n\nGriffin addresses this question at the very beginning of his book on\nwell being (Griffin, 1986,\n ch.2).[10]\n As he puts it,\n\nThe danger is that desire accounts get plausible only by, in effect,\nceasing to be desire accounts. We had to qualify desire with informed,\nand that gave prominence to the features or qualities of the objects\nof desire, and not to the mere existence of desire. (1986, p. 26).\n\n\nGriffin\u2019s account of the relationship between desire and value\nis subtle, and (partly because Griffin himself does not distinguish\nbetween foundational and normative pluralism) it is difficult to say\nwhether his view is foundationally pluralist or not. Griffin argues\nthat it is a mistake to see desire as a blind motivational\nforce\u2014we desire things that we perceive in a favorable light- we\ntake them to have a desirability feature. When we try to explain what\ninvolved in seeing things in a favorable light, we cannot, according\nto Griffin, separate understanding from desire:\n\n\u2026we cannot, even in the case of a desirability feature such as\naccomplishment, separate understanding and desire. Once we see\nsomething as \u2018accomplishment\u2019, as \u2018giving weight and\nsubstance to our lives\u2019, there is no space left for desire to\nfollow along in a secondary subordinate position. Desire is not blind.\nUnderstanding is not bloodless. Neither is the slave of the other.\nThere is no priority. (1986, p. 30)\n\n\nThis suggests that the view is indeed pluralist at the\nfoundation\u2014values are not defined entirely by desire, but partly\nby other features of the situation, and so at the most fundamental\nlevel there is more than one value making feature. Griffin himself\nsays that \u201cthe desire account is compatible with a strong form\nof pluralism about values\u201d (p. 31).\n\nThe question whether or not Griffin is a foundational pluralist is not\npursued further here. The aim in this section is to show first, that\nmonist preference satisfaction accounts of value may have more\ncompelling ways of explaining complexities in value comparison than\nmonist goods approaches, but second, to point out that any constrained\ndesire account may well actually be foundationally pluralist. As soon\nas something is introduced to constrain the desires that qualify as\nvalue conferring, it looks as though another value is operating.\n",
