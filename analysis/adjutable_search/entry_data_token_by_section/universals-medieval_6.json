    "main_text": "Universal Natures in Singular Beings and in Singular Minds\n7. Universal Natures in Singular Beings and in Singular Minds\n\nThe most important influence in this period from our point of view\ncame from Avicenna\u2019s doctrine distinguishing the absolute\nconsideration of a universal nature from what applies to the same\nnature in the subject in which it exists. The distinction is neatly\nsummarized in the following passage.\n\nHorsehood, to be sure, has a definition that does not demand\nuniversality. Rather it is that to which universality happens. Hence\nhorsehood itself is nothing but horsehood only. For in itself it is\nneither many nor one, neither is it existent in these sensibles nor in\nthe soul, neither is it any of these things potentially or actually in\nsuch a way that this is contained under the definition of horsehood.\nRather [in itself it consists] of what is horsehood\n only.[36]\n\n\nIn his little treatise On Being and Essence, Aquinas explains\nthe distinction in greater detail in the following words:\n\n\nA nature, however, or essence \u2026can be considered in two ways.\nFirst, we can consider it according to its proper notion, and this is\nits absolute consideration; and in this way nothing is true of it\nexcept what pertains to it as such; whence if anything else is\nattributed to it, that will yield a false attribution. \u2026In the\nother way [an essence] is considered as it exists in this or that\n[individual]; and in this way something is predicated of it per\naccidens [non-essentially or coincidentally], on account of that\nin which it exists, as when we say that a man is white because\nSocrates is white, although this does not pertain to man as such.\n\nA nature considered in this way, however, has two sorts of existence.\nIt exists in singulars on the one hand, and in the soul on the other,\nand from each of these [sorts of existence] it acquires accidents. In\nthe singulars, furthermore, the essence has several [acts of]\nexistence according to the multiplicity of singulars. Nevertheless, if\nwe consider the essence in the first, or absolute, sense, none of\nthese pertain to it. For it is false to say that the essence of man,\nconsidered absolutely, has existence in this singular, because if\nexistence in this singular pertained to man insofar as he is man, man\nwould never exist, except as this singular. Similarly, if it pertained\nto man insofar as he is man not to exist in this singular, then the\nessence would never exist in the singular. But it is true to say that\nman, but not insofar as he is man, may be in this singular or in that\none, or else in the soul. Therefore, the nature of man considered\nabsolutely abstracts from every existence, though it does not exclude\nany. And the nature thus considered is what is predicated of each\n individual.[37]\n\n\nSo, a common nature or essence according to its absolute consideration\nabstracts from all existence, both in the singulars and in the mind.\nYet, and this is the important point, it is the same nature\nthat informs both the singulars that have this nature and the minds\nconceiving of them in terms of this nature. To be sure, this sameness\nis not numerical sameness, and thus it does not yield numerically one\nnature. On the contrary, it is the sameness of several, numerically\ndistinct realizations of the same information-content, just like the\nsameness of a book in its several copies. Just as there is no such a\nthing as a universal book over and above the singular copies of the\nsame book, so there is no such a thing as a universal nature existing\nover and above the singular things of the same nature; still, just as\nit is true to say that the singular copies are the copies of the\nsame book, so it is true to say that these singulars are of\nthe same nature.\n\nIndeed, this analogy also shows why this conception should be so\nappealing from the point of view of the original epistemological\nproblem of the possibility of universal knowledge, without entailing\nthe ontological problems of na\u00efve Platonism. For just as we do\nnot need to read all copies of the same book in order to know what we\ncan find on the same page in the next copy (provided it is not a\ncorrupt\n copy),[38]\n so we can know what may apply to all singulars of the same nature\nwithout having to experience them all. Still, we need not assume that\nwe can have this knowledge only if we can get somehow in a mysterious\ncontact with the universal nature over and above the singulars; all we\nneed is to learn how \u201cto read\u201d the singulars in our\nexperience to discern the \u201ccommon message\u201d, the universal\nnature, informing them all, uniformly, yet in their distinct\nsingularity. (Note that \u201creading the singulars\u201d is not a\nmere metaphor: this is precisely what geneticists are quite literally\ndoing in the process of gene sequencing, for instance, in the human\ngenome project.) Therefore, the same nature is not the\nsame in the same way as the same individual having this\nnature is the same as long as it exists. For that same\nnature, insofar as it is regarded as the same, does not\neven exist at all; it is said to be the same only insofar as it is\nrecognizable as the same, if we disregard everything\nthat distinguishes its instances in several singulars. (Note here that\nwhoever would want to deny such a recognizable sameness in\nand across several singulars would have to deny that he is able to\nrecognize the same words or the same letters in various sentences; so\nsuch a person would not be able to read, write, or even to speak, or\nunderstand human speech. But then we shouldn\u2019t really worry\nabout such a person in a philosophical debate.)\n\nHowever, at this point some further questions emerge. If this common\nnature is recognizably the same on account of disregarding\nits individuating conditions in the singulars, then isn\u2019t it the\nresult of abstraction; and if so, isn\u2019t it in the abstractive\nmind as its object? But if it is, then how can Aquinas say that it\nabstracts both from being in the singulars and from\nbeing in the mind?\n\nHere we should carefully distinguish between what we can say about\nthe same nature as such, and what we can say about\nthe same nature on account of its conditions as it\nexists in this or that subject. Again, using our analogy, we can\ncertainly consistently say that the same book in its first edition was\n200 pages, whereas in the second only 100, because it was printed on\nlarger pages, but the book itself, as such, is neither 200 nor 100\npages, although it can be either. In the same way, we can consistently\nsay that the same nature as such is neither in the singulars\nnor in the mind, but of course it is only insofar as it is in the mind\nthat it can be recognizably the same, on account of the\nmind\u2019s abstraction. Therefore, that it is abstract and is\nactually recognized as the same in its many instances is something\nthat belongs to the same nature only on account of being conceived by\nthe abstractive mind. This is the reason why the nature is called a\nuniversal concept, insofar as it is in the mind. Indeed, it\nis only under this aspect that it is properly called a universal. So,\nalthough that which is predicable of several\nsingulars is nothing but the common nature as such, considered\nabsolutely, still, that it is predicable pertains to the same\nnature only on account of being conceived by the abstractive\nintellect, insofar as it is a concept of the mind.\n\nAt any rate, this is how Aquinas solves the paralogism that seems to\narise from this account, according to which the true claims that\nSocrates is a man and man is a species would seem to entail the\nfalsity that Socrates is a species. For if we say that in the\nproposition \u2018Socrates is a man\u2019 the predicate signifies\nhuman nature absolutely, but the same nature, on account of its\nabstract character, is a species, the false conclusion seems\ninevitable (Klima 1993a).\n\nHowever, since the common nature is not a species in its absolute\nconsideration, but only insofar as it is in the mind, the conclusion\ndoes not follow. Indeed, this reasoning would be just as invalid as\nthe one trying to prove that this book, pointing to the second edition\nwhich is actually 100 pages, is 200 pages, because the same book was\n200 hundred pages in its first edition. For just as its being 200\npages belongs to the same book only in its first edition, so its being\na species belongs to human nature only as it exists in the mind.\n\nSo, to sum up, we have to distinguish here between the nature existing\nin this singular (such as the individualized human nature of Socrates,\nwhich is numerically one item, mind-independently existing in\nSocrates), the universal (such as the species of human nature existing\nonly in the mind as its object considered in abstraction from the\nindividuating conditions it has in the singular humans), and the\nnature according to its absolute consideration (such as human nature\nconsidered in abstraction both from its existence in the singulars as\nits subjects and in the mind as its object). What establishes the\ndistinction of these items is the difference of what can be truly said\nof them on account of the different conditions they have in this or\nthat. What establishes the unity of these items, however, is that they\nare somehow the same nature existing and considered under different\nconditions. For the human nature in Socrates is numerically one, it is\nnumerically distinct from the human nature in Plato, and it has real,\nmind-independent existence, which is in fact nothing but the existence\nof Socrates, i.e., Socrates\u2019 life. However, although the human\nnature in Socrates is a numerically distinct item from the human\nnature in Plato, insofar as it is human nature, it is formally, in\nfact, specifically the same nature, for it is human nature, and not\nanother, specifically different, say, feline or canine nature. It is\nprecisely this formal, specific, mind-independent sameness of these\nitems (for, of course, say, this cat and that cat do not differ\ninsofar as they are feline, regardless of whether there is anyone to\nrecognize this) that allows the abstractive human mind to recognize\nthis sameness by abstracting from those individuating conditions on\naccount of which this individualized nature in this individual\nnumerically differs from that individualized nature in that\nindividual. Thus, insofar as the formally same nature is actually\nconsidered by a human mind in abstraction from these individualizing\nconditions, it is a universal, a species, an abstract object of a\nmental act whereby a human mind conceives of any individualized human\nnature without its individuating conditions. But, as we could see\nearlier, nothing can be a human nature existing without its\nindividuating conditions, although any individualized human nature can\nbe thought of without thinking of its necessarily conjoined\nindividuating conditions (just as triangular shape can be thought of\nwithout thinking its necessarily conjoined conditions of being\nisosceles or being scalene). So for this universal concept to be is\nnothing but to be thought of, to be an object of the abstractive human\nmind. Finally, human nature in its absolute consideration is the same\nnature abstracted even from this being, i.e., even from being an\nobject of the mind. Thus, as opposed to both in its existence in\nindividuals and in the mind, neither existence, nor non-existence, nor\nunity, nor disunity or multiplicity belongs to it, as it is considered\nwithout any of these; indeed, it is considered without considering its\nbeing considered, for it is considered only in terms of what belongs\nto it on account of itself, not considering anything that has to\nbelong to it on account of something else in which it can only be\n(i.e., whether in the mind or in reality). So, the nature according to\nits absolute consideration does not have numerical unity or\nmultiplicity, which it has as it exists in individuals, nor does it\nhave the formal unity that it has in the consideration of the mind\n(insofar as it is one species among many), but it has that formal\nunity which precedes even the recognition of this unity by the\nabstractive\n mind.[39]\n\nNevertheless, even if with these distinctions Aquinas\u2019 solution\nof the paralogism works and what he says about the existence and unity\nvs. multiplicity of a common nature can be given a consistent\ninterpretation, the emergence of the paralogism itself and the\ncomplexities involved in explaining it away, as well as the problems\ninvolved in providing this consistent interpretation show the inherent\ndifficulties of this account. The main difficulty is the trouble of\nkeeping track of what we are talking about when it becomes crucial to\nknow what pertains to what on account of what; in general, when the\nconditions of identity and distinction of the items we are talking\nabout become variable and occasionally rather unclear.\n\nIndeed, we can appreciate just how acute these difficulties may become\nif we survey the items that needed to be distinguished in what may be\ndescribed as the common conceptual framework of the\n\u201crealist\u201d via antiqua, the \u201cold way\u201d\nof doing philosophy and theology, before the emergence of the\n\u201cmodern way\u201d, the \u201cnominalist\u201d via\nmoderna challenging some fundamental principles of the older\nframework, resulting mostly from the semantic innovations introduced\nby William Ockham. The survey of these items and the problems they\ngenerate will then allow us to see in greater detail the main\nmotivation for Ockham\u2019s innovations.\n",
