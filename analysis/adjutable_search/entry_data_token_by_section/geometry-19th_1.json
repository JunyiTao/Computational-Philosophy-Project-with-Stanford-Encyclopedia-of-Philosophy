    "main_text": "Projective geometry\n2. Projective geometry\n\n\nToday projective geometry does not play a big role in mathematics, but\nin the late nineteenth century it came to be synonymous with modern\ngeometry. Projective methods had been employed by Desargues\n(b.\u00a01591, d.\u00a01661) and Pascal (b.\u00a01623, d.\u00a01662),\nbut were later eclipsed by Descartes's method of coordinates. They\nprospered, however, after Jean-Victor Poncelet (b.\u00a01788,\nd.\u00a01867) showed that the projective properties of figures\nfurnished grounds of proof that were at least as powerful as, and\ncertainly more intuitive and ostensibly compelling than the Cartesian\nprocedure of setting up and solving equations between numbers\nrepresenting points. \n\n\nProjective properties are those preserved by projections. Take, for\nexample, two planes \u0393 and H and a point P\noutside them. Let \u03a6 be any figure on \u0393. Draw straight lines\nfrom P through each point of \u03a6. The figure formed by the\npoints where these lines meet H is the projection of \u03a6 on\nH from P. Generally this figure will differ from\n\u03a6 in size and shape. But the projection of any number of straight\nlines on \u0393 meeting each other at certain points generally\nconsists of an equal number of straight lines on H meeting\nrespectively at the projection of those points. What happens, however,\nif the straight line joining P with some point Q of\n\u0393 never meets H, because PQ happens\nto lie on a plane parallel to H? (See Figure 3.)\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\nTo obviate such irksome exceptions, projective geometry added to each\nstraight line in space an ideal point, shared by every line parallel to\nit. Continuity requires then that all ideal points lie on a single\nideal plane, which meets each family of parallel planes along a\ndifferent ideal line. Fundamentalists may shudder at this seemingly\nwanton multiplication of entities. However, it had been practised in\narithmetic for centuries, as the initial stock of natural numbers 1, 2,\n3, \u2026 , was supplemented with zero, the negative integers, the\nnon-integral rationals, the irrationals, and the so-called imaginary\nnumbers. \n\n\nThe points of a straight line stand in mutual relations of\nneighborhood and order. To see how the ideal point fits into these\nrelations let H rotate continually about the straight line\nm where it intersects \u0393. (See Figure 4.) When\nH is parallel to PQ\u2014say, at time\nt\u2014the projection of Q on H from\nP is the ideal point of the straight line through P\nand Q. Right before t the said projection is an\nordinary point of H, very far from m.  Right after\nt the projection is again an ordinary point of H,\nvery far from m, but at the opposite end of the\nplane. Studying the continuous displacement of the projection during a\nshort time interval surrounding t, one concludes that if\nA and B are any two points of H that stand,\nrespectively, on either side of m, the ideal point of the\nstraight line through A and B must be placed between\nA and B.  Thus, in projective geometry, the points\nof a straight line are ordered cyclically, i.e., like the points of a\ncircle. As a result of this, the neighborhood relations among points\nin projective space and on projective planes differ drastically from\nthose familiar from standard geometry, and are highly\ncounterintuitive. It is fair to say that projective geometry signified\na much deeper and far-reaching revolution in human thought than did\nthe mere denial of Euclid's Postulate.\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\nIn the new setting, the projective properties of figures can be\ndefined unexceptionably. a one-one mapping f of projective\nspace onto itself is a collineation if it sends any three\ncollinear points A, B, and C, to three\npoints (A), (B), and (C), which are\ncollinear too. Projective properties (and relations) are those which\nare preserved by collineations. Here are a few examples of projective\nproperties. Of three or more points: to lie on the same straight line;\nto lie on the same plane. Of three or more straight lines: to meet at\nthe same point; to lie on the same plane. Of three or more planes: to\nintersect along the same straight line; to share the same point. Of\ncurves: to be a conic. Of surfaces: to be a quadric.\n",
