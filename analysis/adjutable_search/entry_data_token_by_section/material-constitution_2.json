    "main_text": "Temporal Parts\n3. Temporal Parts\n\nConsider the case of Interstate 5. I-5 runs through Washington,\nOregon, and California, but the road is not wholly present in any of\nthose states. Rather, I-5 exists in different states by having\ndifferent road segments in each\u2014there is the Washington segment\nof I-5, the Oregon segment, etc. According to the temporal parts\ntheory (or four-dimensionalism), persistence through\ntime is exactly like that. (Quine 1953, Lewis 1976, Sider\n2001) Just as roads exist at different places by having distinct\nspatial parts at those places, material objects exist at different\ntimes by having distinct temporal parts at those times. In\nthe case of David Lewis, for example, there is the 1970s segment, the\n1980s segment, and so on. More formally, we can say that x is\na temporal part of y at (or during) t if and only if\n(i) x is a part of y at (or during) t, (ii)\nx overlaps everything that is a part of y at (or\nduring) t, and (iii) x exists only at (or during)\nt (Sider 2001, p. 60).\n\nConsider now the case of U.S. Route 29, which runs from the western\nsuburbs of Baltimore to Pensacola, Florida. As U.S. 29 passes through\nCharlotte it becomes Tyson St.\u2014a street wholly located within\nthe state of North Carolina. The two roadways in this case are not\nidentical, but they are partly identical, for Tyson St. is\nidentical to a proper part of U.S. 29. According to the temporal parts\ntheorist, the case of the statue and the clay is similar. Lump exists\nfor some period of time and then \u201cturns into\u201d David. If\nthe sculptor is unsatisfied with her work and squashes the statue,\nthen Lump\u2014but not David\u2014continues to exist, in which case\nDavid is nothing more than a proper temporal part of Lump.\n\nThere are, of course, various arguments for and against this view.\n(See the entry on\n temporal parts.)\n Here, we focus on the relevance of the doctrine to the puzzles of\nmaterial constitution and, in particular, to the challenges facing the\nconstitution view.\n\nThe impenetrability objection. The first problem for the\nconstitution view was that it allowed for two material objects to\nexist in the same place at the same time. The temporal parts theorist\navoids this objection for he will say that, whenever Lump and David\nexist, there is a single object that exactly occupies the relevant\nlocation\u2014a temporal part that is shared by both David and Lump.\nOf course, those two objects will be partly present at the\nsame location, but this is no more problematic than two roads being\npartly present at the same place by sharing a common road segment.\n\nThe extensionality objection. The second problem for the\nconstitution view was that it allowed for two objects to be composed\nof all the same parts. The temporal parts theorist avoids this problem\nin the case of the statue and the lump, since he will say that those\nobjects share some, but not all, of the same temporal parts. Of\ncourse, those objects will have all the same parts when they both\nexist, but this is no more problematic than two roads sharing all\nthe same parts where they overlap.\n\nThe grounding objection. The third challenge for the\nconstitution theorist was to identify a ground for the different\nfeatures of coinciding objects. The same challenge can be put to the\nfriend of temporal parts. In the case of the statue and the clay, for\nexample, we have two objects that are perfect duplicates whenever they\nboth exist\u2014in virtue of what, then, do they differ with respect\nto their temporal properties, persistence conditions, and so on? The\ntemporal parts theorist could follow the constitution theorist in\nclaiming that the relevant objects differ in kind, for example, in\nvirtue of their historical properties or he could simply insist that\nthe difference in kind is grounded in the fact that the two objects\nhave different temporal parts (Wasserman 2002).\n\nThe anthropic objection. The last worry for the constitution\nview was that it postulated an unexplained correspondence between the\nsortal terms in our language and the kinds of objects in the world.\nThe temporal parts theorist avoids this worry as well. On the standard\nfour-dimensionalist picture, persisting objects are ultimately\ncomposed of instantaneous temporal parts and, for any collection of\nthese parts, there is a further object that they compose (Quine 1960,\np. 171). For example, there is an object composed of all and only the\ntemporal parts of David when that statue is indoors. This\nwould be what we earlier called an \u201cinstatue\u201d. There is\nalso an object composed of all and only the temporal parts of David\nwhen that statue is in the light. This is what we earlier\ncalled a \u201clitstatue\u201d. In this way, the temporal parts\ntheorist finds a place for all of the objects introduced earlier, and\nthereby avoids an implausible correlation between the sortal terms of\nour language and the kinds of objects in the world. (Of course, some\npeople think that this solution is worse than the problem\u2014see,\nfor example, Markosian 1998, p. 228, Elder 2008: 440, and Korman 2015:\nChapter 4.)\n\nUnfortunately, the temporal parts solution cannot be extended to the\ncase Lumpl and Goliath since those objects exist at all of the same\ntimes and thus share the same temporal parts. The four-dimensionalist\nwho accepts extensionality will therefore be forced to conclude that\nLumpl is identical to Goliath. This, however, is problematic, since\nthose objects seem to differ in their modal properties. Lumpl, for\nexample, could survive beings squashed, whereas Goliath could not.\n\nThe most popular reply to this worry is due to David Lewis (1971,\n1986), who defends a counterpart theory of de re\nmodal ascriptions. According to Lewis, ordinary objects like Goliath\nexist in only one possible world, but have counterparts at\nother worlds that serve as truth-makers for de re modal\nascriptions. Crucially, whether or not something counts as a\ncounterpart of Goliath (for example) will depend on what respects of\nsimilarity are at issue. Since the name \u2018Goliath\u2019 is associated with\nthe kind statue, a sentence like \u201cGoliath could survive being\nsquashed\u201d will normally be true (relative to a context) just in case\nGoliath has some statue-counterparts that survive squashing\n(i.e., some counterparts that survive squashing as statues).\nPresumably, there are no such counterparts, so that sentence will\nexpress a falsehood. Meanwhile, the name \u2018Lumpl\u2019 is\nassociate with kind lump of clay, so a sentence like \u201cLumpl\ncould survive being squashed\u201d will be true just in case Lumpl has a\nlump-counterpart that survives being squashed. Presumably,\nthere are some such objects at other worlds, so that sentence will\nexpress a truth. Moreover, this will be the case even if the temporal\nparts theorist is correct and a single object is picked out by both\n\u2018Lumpl\u2019 and \u2018Goliath\u2019. The key point is that\nthe phrase \u2018could survive being squashed\u2019 expresses different\nproperties when combined with these names, so Leibniz\u2019s Law has\nno application. (For objections to counterpart theory, see Fara and\nWilliamson 2005.)\n\nOne worry for this response is that it cannot account for apparent\nnon-modal differences between Lumpl and Goliath. For example, Kit Fine\n(2003) argues that Lumpl, but not Goliath, might be\nwell-made, and that Goliath, but not Lumpl, might be\nRomanesque. Since these are not modal ascriptions,\ncounterpart theory has no application. As a result, it is unclear what\nthe temporal parts theorist is to say about apparent differences of\nthis sort.
