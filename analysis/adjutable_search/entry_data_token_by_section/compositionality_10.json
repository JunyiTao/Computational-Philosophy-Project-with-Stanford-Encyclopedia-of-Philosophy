    "main_text": "Arguments for Compositionality || Systematicity\n3.2 Systematicity\n\nAnother argument in favor of compositionality is based on\nsystematicity, the fact that there are definite and\npredictable patterns among the sentences we understand. For example,\nanyone who understands \u2018The rug is under the chair\u2019 can\nunderstand \u2018The chair is under the rug\u2019 and vice\nversa. This is also an inference to the best explanation, and can\nbe summarized as follows:\n\nArgument from systematicity: Anyone who understands a complex\nexpression e and \\(e'\\) built up through the syntactic\noperation F from constituents \\(e_1 ,\\ldots ,e_n\\) and \\(e_1\n',\\ldots ,e_n '\\) respectively, can also understand any other\nmeaningful complex expression \\(e''\\) built up through F from\nexpressions among \\(e_1 ,\\ldots ,e_n, e_1 ',\\ldots ,e_n '\\). So, it\nmust be that anyone who knows what e and \\(e'\\)mean is in the\nposition to figure out, without any additional information, what\n\\(e''\\) means. If this is so, the meaning of e and \\(e'\\) must\njointly determine the meaning of \\(e''\\). But the only plausible way\nthis could be true is if the meaning of e determines F\nand the meanings of \\(e_1 ,\\ldots ,e_n\\), the meaning of \\(e'\\)\ndetermines F and the meanings of \\(e_1 ',\\ldots ,e_n '\\), and\nF and the meanings of \\(e_1 ,\\ldots ,e_n , e_1 ',\\ldots ,e_n\n'\\) determine the meaning of \\(e''\\).\n\n\nAlthough the arguments from productivity and systematicity are usually\nalluded to in the same breath, they are very different\nconsiderations. Unlike the main premise of the former, the main\npremise of the latter is anything but obvious. Particular instances\nare plausible enough: it seems reasonable that anyone who can\nunderstand \u2018The dog is asleep\u2019 and \u2018The cat is\nawake\u2019 can also understand \u2018The dog is awake\u2019 and\n\u2018The cat is asleep\u2019, and that anyone who can understand\n\u2018black dog\u2019 and \u2018white cat\u2019 can also\nunderstand \u2018black cat\u2019 and \u2018white dog\u2019. But do\nall who understand \u2018within an hour\u2019 and \u2018without a\nwatch\u2019 also understand \u2018within a watch\u2019 and\n\u2018without an hour\u2019? And do all who understand\n\u2018halfway closed\u2019 and \u2018firmly believed\u2019 also\nunderstand \u2018halfway believed\u2019 and \u2018firmly\nclosed\u2019? As Johnson (2004) argues, the claim that natural\nlanguages are systematic presupposes a natural non-overlapping\nlinguistic categorization of all the expressions. The existence of\nsuch a categorization is a bold empirical hypothesis.\n\nFodor (1998b) does offer an empirical argument in favor of\nsystematicity. The idea is that if complex expressions could be\nunderstood without understanding their constituents then it is unclear\nhow exposure to a corpus made up almost entirely of complex\nexpressions could suffice to learn the meanings of lexical items. But,\nas a matter of empirical fact, children learn the meanings of words by\nencountering them almost exclusively within other expressions.\nHowever, as Robbins (2005) points out, this observation can at best\nlead one to conclude that understanding a suitably large set\nof complex expressions in which a given expression occurs as a\nconstituent suffices for understanding the constituent itself. It does\nnot show that understanding any complex expression suffices\nfor understanding its constituents.\n\nThe arguments from productivity and systematicity differ in what they\naim to prove. First, the argument from systematicity proves something\nweaker than (any version of) compositionality. If we run the argument\nfor the pair of sentences \u2018The dog is asleep\u2019 and\n\u2018The cat is awake\u2019 we can conclude that the meanings of\n\u2018the dog\u2019, \u2018the cat\u2019, \u2018is asleep\u2019\nand \u2018is awake\u2019 plus predication determine the meaning of\n\u2018The dog is awake\u2019. It does not follow that the\nmeanings of \u2018the dog\u2019 and \u2018is awake\u2019 plus\npredication do that. Second, if this problem can be fixed somehow, the\nargument from systematicity proves not only global, but\nlocal compositionality: it tells us that the meanings of\nimmediate constituents and immediate structure fix the meanings of\ncomplex expressions. Finally, if successful, the argument from\nsystematicity proves not only a version of the compositionality\nprinciple, but also reverse compositionality. We are invited to\nconclude that the meaning of an arbitrary complex expression\ndetermines its immediate structure and the meanings of its immediate\nconstituents; cf.\n section 1.6.4,\nFodor & Lepore 2001: 59;\nPagin 2003: 292.\n\nAs with the argument from productivity, the argument from\nsystematicity is unable to screen out isolated counterexamples. Still,\nit is a reasonably strong consideration in favor of the claim that\nnatural languages by and large obey language-bound\ndistributive local compositionality of meaning and its reverse.\n",
