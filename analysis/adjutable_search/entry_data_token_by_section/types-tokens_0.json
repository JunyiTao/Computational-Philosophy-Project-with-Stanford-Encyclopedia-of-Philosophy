    "main_text": "The Distinction Between Types and Tokens || What the Distinction Is\n1.1 What the Distinction Is\n\n\nThe distinction between a type and its tokens is\nan ontological one between a general sort of thing and its particular\nconcrete instances (to put it in an intuitive and preliminary way). So\nfor example consider the number of words in the Gertrude Stein line\nfrom her poem Sacred Emily on the page in front of the\nreader's eyes:\n\n\nRose is a rose is a rose is a rose.\n\n\nIn one sense of \u2018word\u2019 we may count three different\nwords; in another sense we may count ten different words. C. S. Peirce\n(1931-58, sec. 4.537) called words in the first sense\n\u201ctypes\u201d and words in the second sense \u201ctokens\u201d.\nTypes are generally said to be abstract and unique; tokens are concrete\nparticulars, composed of ink, pixels of light (or the suitably\ncircumscribed lack thereof) on a computer screen, electronic strings of\ndots and dashes, smoke signals, hand signals, sound waves, etc. A study\nof the ratio of written types to spoken types found that there are\ntwice as many word types in written Swedish as in spoken Swedish\n(Allwood, 1998). If a pediatrician asks how many words the toddler has\nuttered and is told \u201cthree hundred\u201d, she might well enquire\n\u201cword types or word tokens?\u201d because the former answer\nindicates a prodigy. A headline that reads \u201cFrom the Andes to\nEpcot, the Adventures of an 8,000 year old Bean\u201d might elicit\n\u201cIs that a bean type or a bean token?\u201d.\n",
