    "main_text": "Identity over time\n5. Identity over time\n\nAs noted in the last section, another source of apparent disunity in\nthe concept of a criterion of identity is the distinction made between\nsynchronic criteria of identity and diachronic criteria of identity.\nCriteria of identity can be employed synchronically, as in the\nexamples just given, to determine whether two coexistent objects are\nparts of the same object of a sort, or diachronically, to determine\nidentity over time. But as Lowe notes (2012: 137), it is an error to\nsuppose that diachronic identity and synchronic identity are different\nkinds of identity and so demand different kinds of identity criteria.\nWhat then is a criterion of identity over time?\n\nIdentity over time is itself a controversial notion, however, because\ntime involves change. Heraclitus argued that one could not bathe in\nthe same river twice because new waters were ever flowing in. Hume\nargued that identity over time was a fiction we substitute for a\ncollection of related objects. Such views can be seen as based on a\nmisunderstanding of Leibniz\u2019s Law: if a thing changes something\nis true of it at the later time that is not true of it at the earlier,\nso it is not the same. The answer is that what is true of it at the\nlater time is, say, \u201cbeing muddy at the later time\u201d, which\nwas always true of it; similarly, what is true of it at the earlier\ntime, suitably expressed, remains true of it. But the question remains\nhow to characterise identity through time and across change given that\nthere is such a thing.\n\nOne topic which has always loomed large in this debate has been the\nissue (in the terminology of Lewis 1986, Ch. 4) of perdurance\nversus endurance. (Others, for which there is no space for\ndiscussion here, include the debate over Ship of Theseus and\nreduplication or fission problems and associated issues about\n\u201cbest candidate\u201d or \u201cno rival candidate\u201d\naccounts of identity over time, and the debate over Humean\nsupervenience \u2013 see articles on relative identity, personal\nidentity, Hawley 2001 and Sider 2001.)\n\nAccording to one view, material objects persist by having temporal\nparts or stages, which exist at different times and are to be\ndistinguished by the times at which they exist \u2013 this is known\nas the view that material objects perdure. Other philosophers deny\nthat this is so; according to them, when a material object exists at\ndifferent times, it is wholly present at those times, for it has no\ntemporal parts, but only spatial parts, which likewise are wholly\npresent at the different times they exist. This is known as the view\nthat material objects endure.\n\nPerdurance theorists, as Quine puts it, reject the point of view\ninherent in the tenses of our natural language. From that point of\nview persisting things endure and change through time, but do not\nextend through time, but only through space. Thus persisting\nthings are to be sharply distinguished from events or processes, which\nprecisely do extend through time. One way of describing the position\nof the perdurance theorist, then, is to say that he denies the\nexistence of a distinct ontological category of persisting\nthings, or substances. Thus, Quine writes, \u201cphysical\nobjects, conceived thus four-dimensionally in space-time, are not to\nbe distinguished from events, or, in the concrete sense of the term,\nprocesses. Each comprises simply the content, however heterogeneous,\nof some portion of space-time, however disconnected and\ngerrymandered\u201d (1960:171).\n\nIn recent controversy two arguments have been at the centre of the\nendurance/perdurance debate, one employed by perdurance theorists and\nthe other by endurance theorists (for other arguments and issues see\nthe separate article on temporal parts, Hawley 2001 and Sider\n2001).\n\nAn argument for perdurance which has been hotly debated is due to\nDavid Lewis (1986). If perdurance is rejected, the ascription of dated\nor tensed properties to objects must be regarded as assertions of\nirreducible relations between objects and times. If Tabby is\nfat on Monday, that is a relation between Tabby and Monday, and if\nperdurance is rejected it is an irreducible relation between Tabby and\nMonday. According to perdurance theory, however, while it is still, of\ncourse, a relation between Tabby and Monday it is not irreducible; it\nholds between Tabby and Monday because the temporal part of Tabby on\nMonday, Tabby-on-Monday, is intrinsically fat. If perdurance is\nrejected, however, no such intrinsic possessor of the property of\nfatness can be recognised: Tabby\u2019s fatness on Monday must be\nregarded as an irreducible state of affairs.\n\nAccording to Lewis, this consequence of the rejection of the\nperdurance theory is incredible. Whether he is right about this is the\nsubject of intense debate (Haslanger 2003).\n\nEven if Lewis is right, however, the perdurance theory may still be\nfound wanting, since it does not secure the most commonsensical\nposition: that fatness is a property of a cat (Haslanger\n2003). According to perdurance theory, rather, it is a property of a\n(temporal) cat part. Those known as stage theorists (Hawley 2001,\nSider 2001), accepting the ontology of perdurance theory, but\nmodifying its semantics, offer a way to secure this desirable result.\nEvery temporal part of a cat is a cat, they say, so\nTabby-on-Monday (which is what we refer to by \u201cTabby\u201d, on\nMonday) is a cat and is fat, just as we would like. Stage theorists\nhave to pay a price for this advantage over perdurance theory,\nhowever. For they must accept either that our reports of the\ncross-temporal number of cats are not always reports of the counting\nof cats (as when I say, truly, that I have only ever owned three cats)\nor that two cat-stages (cats) may be counted as one and the\nsame cat, so that counting cats is not always counting in accordance\nwith absolute identity.\n\nAn argument against the perdurance theory that has been the focus of\ninterest is one presented in various guises by a number of writers,\nincluding Wiggins (1980), Thomson (1983) and van Inwagen (1990).\nApplied to persons (it can equally well be applied to other persisting\nthings), it asserts that persons have different properties, in\nparticular, different modal properties, from the summations of\nperson-stages with which the perdurance theory identifies them. Thus,\nby Leibniz\u2019s Law, this identification must be mistaken. As David\nWiggins states the argument: \u201cAnything that is a part of a\nLesniewskian sum [a mereological whole defined by its parts] is\nnecessarily part of it\u2026But no person or normal material object\nis necessarily in the total state that will correspond to the\nperson- or object-moment postulated by the theory under\ndiscussion\u201d (1980: 168).\n\nTo elaborate a little. I might have died when I was five years old.\nBut that maximal summation of person-stages which, according to\nperdurance theory, is me and has a temporal extent of at\nleast fifty years, could not have had a temporal extent of a mere five\nyears. So I cannot be such a summation of stages.\n\nThis argument illustrates the interdependence of the various topics\ndiscussed under the rubric of identity. Whether it is valid, of\ncourse, depends on the correct analysis of modal predication, and, in\nparticular, on whether it should be analysed in terms of\n\u201cidentity across possible worlds\u201d or in terms of Lewisian\ncounterpart theory. This is the topic of the next section.\n",
