    "main_text": "Problem II: Anomalous Monism || The Argument for Anomalous Monism\n5.1 The Argument for Anomalous Monism\n\nAt the core of anomalous monism are three principles:\n\n\nPrinciple of Causal Interaction: Some mental events interact\ncausally with physical events.\n\nPrinciple of the Nomological Character of Causality: Events\nrelated as cause and effect fall under strict laws.\n\nAnomalism of the Mental: There are no strict laws on the\nbasis of which mental events can be predicted and explained.\n\n\nAccording to Davidson, the apparent tension among these principles\ngives rise to the mind\u2013body problem. Most of us unquestioningly\nassent to the first principle. The second is more controversial,\nalthough Davidson provides little argument for it. Here we just note\nthat it\u2019s not as strong as it seems, for \u201cstrict\u201d is\nnot synonymous with \u201cdeterministic\u201d. A strict law is\nexceptionless, but could be either deterministic or probabilistic.\n\nThe third principle is the most contested of the three. It rules out\nstrict laws in psychology; in particular\u2014and most importantly\nfor present concerns\u2014it rules out strict psychophysical laws,\nthat is, laws connecting the mental and physical. According to\nDavidson, application conditions for mental predicates feature a\nrationality constraint absent from the application conditions for\nphysical predicates. In ascribing beliefs to others, for instance, we\nemploy a principle of charity that counsels us to make these believers\nas rational as possible. But this normative constraint has, as\nDavidson puts it, \u201cno echo\u201d in the physical realm. In this\nregard, mental and physical predicates are misaligned in a way that\nprecludes strict psychophysical laws.\n\nNow the second two principles seem to rule out the first. If causation\nrequires strict laws, and there are no strict psychophysical laws, how\ncan the mental be causally efficacious? But Davidson notes there is a\nway to save the first principle: as long as every mental event is\nphysical, the first principle is compatible with the other two. In\nthis way, the three principles entail event monism. At the\nsame time, Davidson\u2019s view entails type dualism, for\nthe anomalism of the mental (the third principle) precludes identities\nbetween mental and physical types. Most philosophers find it natural\nto say that types are properties, so Davidson is sometimes described\nas a property dualist, a convenient label for the time being (but see\n\u00a75.5).\n",
