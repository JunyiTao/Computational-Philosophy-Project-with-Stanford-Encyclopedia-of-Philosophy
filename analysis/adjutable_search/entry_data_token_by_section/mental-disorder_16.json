Values and Mental Disorder\n\nValues have unfailingly played a part in the way mental disorders are\nclassified, conceptualized, experienced as personal diagnosis, and\ntreated. Philosophical accounts differ over the possibility of a\nvalue-free science of psychiatry (these are considered in\n \u00a78.1).\n Values also affect societal and personal attitudes towards disorder\nand diagnosis, in ways that are more immediate, considerably more\nurgent, and morally consequential (see\n \u00a78.2).\n Some of these issues are dealt with in bioethical research directed\nspecifically towards psychiatry\n (\u00a78.3).\n",
