    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language || Frege\u2019s Theory of Sense and Denotation\n3.2 Frege\u2019s Theory of Sense and Denotation\n\n\nTo explain these puzzles, Frege suggested (1892a) that in addition to\nhaving a denotation, names and descriptions also express a\n sense.[5] \n The sense of an expression accounts for its\ncognitive significance\u2014it is the way by which one conceives of\nthe denotation of the term. The expressions \u2018\\(4\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(8/2\\)\u2019 have the same denotation but express\ndifferent senses, different ways of conceiving the same number. The\ndescriptions \u2018the morning star\u2019 and \u2018the evening\nstar\u2019 denote the same planet, namely Venus, but express\ndifferent ways of conceiving of Venus and so have different\nsenses. The name \u2018Pegasus\u2019 and the description \u2018the\nmost powerful Greek god\u2019 both have a sense (and their senses are\ndistinct), but neither has a denotation. However, even though the\nnames \u2018Mark Twain\u2019 and \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 denote\nthe same individual, they express different senses. (See May 2006b for\na nice discussion of the question of whether Frege believed that the\nsense of a name varies from person to person.) Using the distinction\nbetween sense and denotation, Frege can account for the difference in\ncognitive significance between identity statements of the form\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and those of the form\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019. Since the sense of \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 differs\nfrom the sense of \u2018\\(b\\)\u2019, the components of the sense of\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and the sense of \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019 are\ndifferent.  Frege can claim that the sense of the whole expression is\ndifferent in the two cases. Since the sense of an expression accounts\nfor its cognitive significance, Frege has an explanation of the\ndifference in cognitive significance between \u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019, and thus a solution to the first puzzle.\n\n\nMoreover, Frege proposed that when a term (name or description)\nfollows a propositional attitude verb, it no longer denotes what it\nordinarily denotes. Instead, Frege claims that in such contexts, a\nterm denotes its ordinary sense. This explains why the Principle of\nIdentity Substitution fails for terms following the propositional\nattitude verbs in propositional attitude reports. The Principle\nasserts that truth is preserved when we substitute one name for\nanother having the same denotation. But, according to Frege\u2019s\ntheory, the names \u2018Mark Twain\u2019 and \u2018Samuel\nClemens\u2019 denote different senses when they occur in the\nfollowing sentences:\n\nJohn believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n John believes that Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n\n\nIf they don\u2019t denote the same object, then there is no reason to\nthink that substitution of one name for another would preserve\ntruth.\n\n\nFrege developed the theory of sense and denotation into a\nthoroughgoing philosophy of language. This philosophy can be\nexplained, at least in outline, by considering a simple sentence such\nas \u2018John loves Mary\u2019. In Frege\u2019s view, the words\n\u2018John\u2019 and \u2018Mary\u2019 in this sentence are names,\nthe expression \u2018loves\u2019 signifies a function, and,\nmoreover, the sentence as a whole is a complex name. Each of these\nexpressions has both a sense and a denotation. The sense and\ndenotation of the names are basic; but sense and denotation of the\nsentence as a whole can be described in terms of the sense and\ndenotation of the names and the way in which those words are arranged\nin the sentence alongside the expression \u2018loves\u2019 (though\nsee Heck & May 2011 for discussion on whether the sense of a\npredicate maps the sense of a name to a thought). Let us refer to the\ndenotation and sense of the words as follows:\n\n \\(d[j]\\) refers to the denotation of the name \u2018John\u2019.\n\n \\(d[m]\\) refers to the denotation of the name\n\u2018Mary\u2019.\n\n \\(d[L]\\) refers to the denotation of the expression\n\u2018loves\u2019.\n\n \\(s[j]\\) refers to the sense of the name\n\u2018John\u2019.\n\n \\(s[m]\\) refers to the sense of the name\n\u2018Mary\u2019.\n\n \\(s[L]\\) refers to the sense of the expression\n\u2018loves\u2019.\n\n\nWe now work toward a theoretical description of the denotation of the\nsentence as a whole. On Frege\u2019s view, \\(d[j]\\) and\n\\(d[m]\\) are the real individuals John and Mary,\nrespectively. \\(d[L]\\) is a function that maps\n\\(d[m]\\) (i.e., Mary) to the function (\u00a0)\nloves Mary. This latter function serves as the denotation of\nthe predicate \u2018loves Mary\u2019 and we can use the notation\n\\(d[Lm]\\) to refer to it semantically. Now the function \\(d[Lm]\\) maps\n\\(d[j]\\) (i.e., John) to the denotation of the sentence \u2018John\nloves Mary\u2019.  Let us refer to the denotation of the sentence as\n\\(d[jLm]\\). Frege identifies the denotation of a sentence as one of\nthe two truth values.  Because \\(d[Lm]\\) maps objects to truth values,\nit is a concept. Thus, \\(d[jLm]\\) is the truth value The True if John\nfalls under the concept \\(d[Lm]\\); otherwise it is the truth value The\nFalse. So, on Frege\u2019s view, the sentence \u2018John loves\nMary\u2019 names a truth \nvalue.[6]\n\n\nThe sentence \u2018John loves Mary\u2019 also expresses a sense.\nIts sense may be described as follows. Although Frege doesn\u2019t\nappear to have explicitly said so, his work suggests that \\(s[L]\\)\n(the sense of the expression \u2018loves\u2019) is a function. This\nfunction would map \\(s[m]\\) (the sense of the name \u2018Mary\u2019)\nto the sense of the predicate \u2018loves Mary\u2019. Let us refer\nto the sense of \u2018loves Mary\u2019 as \\(s[Lm]\\). Now again,\nFrege\u2019s work seems to imply that we should regard \\(s[Lm]\\) as a\nfunction which maps \\(s[j]\\) (the sense of the name\n\u2018John\u2019) to the sense of the whole sentence. Let us call\nthe sense of the entire sentence\n \\(s[jLm]\\).[7]\n Frege calls the sense of a sentence a\nthought, and whereas there are only two truth values, he\nsupposes that there are an infinite number of thoughts.\n\n\nWith this description of language, Frege can give a general account of\nthe difference in the cognitive significance between identity\nstatements of the form \u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019. The cognitive significance is not accounted for\nat the level of denotation. On Frege\u2019s view, the sentences\n\u2018\\(4=8/2\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(4=4\\)\u2019 both denote\nthe same truth value. The function \\((\\:)=(\\:)\\) maps \\(4\\) and\n\\(8/2\\) to The True, i.e., maps \\(4\\) and \\(4\\) to The\nTrue. So \\(d[4=8/2]\\) is identical to \\(d[4=4]\\); they are\nboth The True. However, the two sentences in question express\ndifferent thoughts. That is because \\(s[4]\\) is different from\n\\(s[8/2]\\). So the thought \\(s[4=8/2]\\) is distinct\nfrom the thought \\(s[4=4]\\). Similarly, \u2018Mark Twain = Mark\nTwain\u2019 and \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens\u2019 denote the\nsame truth value. However, given that \\(s\\)[Mark Twain] is distinct\nfrom \\(s\\)[Samuel Clemens], Frege would claim that the thought\n\\(s\\)[Mark Twain = Mark Twain] is distinct from the thought\n\\(s\\)[Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens].\n\n\nFurthermore, recall that Frege proposed that terms following\npropositional attitude verbs denote not their ordinary denotations but\nrather the senses they ordinarily express. In fact, in the following\npropositional attitude report, not only do the words \u2018Mark\nTwain\u2019, \u2018wrote\u2019 and \u2018Huckleberry Finn\n\u2019 denote their ordinary senses, but the entire sentence\n\u2018Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019 also denotes\nits ordinary sense (namely, a thought):\n\nJohn believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n\n\nFrege, therefore, would analyze this attitude report as follows:\n\u2018believes that\u2019 denotes a function that maps the denotation\nof the sentence \u2018Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry\nFinn\u2019 to a concept. In this case, however, the denotation of\nthe sentence \u2018Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019\nis not a truth value but rather a thought. The thought it denotes is\ndifferent from the thought denoted by \u2018Samuel Clemens wrote\nHuckleberry Finn\u2019 in the following propositional\nattitude report:\n\nJohn believes that Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n\n\nSince the thought denoted by \u2018Samuel Clemens wrote\nHuckleberry Finn\u2019 in this context differs from the\nthought denoted by \u2018Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry\nFinn\u2019 in the same context, the concept denoted by\n\u2018believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019\nis a different concept from the one denoted by \u2018believes that\nSamuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019. One may\nconsistently suppose that the concept denoted by the former predicate\nmaps John to The True whereas the concept denoted by the latter\npredicate does not. Frege\u2019s analysis therefore preserves our\nintuition that John can believe that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry\nFinn without believing that Samuel Clemens did. It also preserves\nthe Principle of Identity Substitution\u2014the fact that one cannot\nsubstitute \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 for \u2018Mark Twain\u2019\nwhen these names occur after propositional attitude verbs does not\nconstitute evidence against the Principle. For if Frege is right,\nnames do not have their usual denotation when they occur in these\ncontexts.\n",
