Statements such as \u201cMy\nmother shall go to London\u201d or \u201cThere will be a sea-battle\ntomorrow\u201d could serve as standard examples. What could be called\nthe problem of future contingents concerns how to ascribe truth-values\nto such statements. If there are several possible decisions out of\nwhich one is going to be made freely tomorrow, can there be a truth\nnow about which one will be made? If \u201cyes\u201d, on what\ngrounds could something which is still open, nevertheless be true\nalready now? If \u201cno\u201d, can we in fact hold that all\nlogically exclusive possibilities must be untrue without denying that\none of the possible outcomes must turn out to be the chosen\n one?[1]\n\nIn point of fact, \u201cfuture contingents\u201d could also refer to\nfuture contingent objects. A statement like \u201cThe first astronaut\nto go to Mars will have a unique experience\u201d could be analyzed\nas referring to an object not yet existing, supposing that one day in\nthe distant future some person will indeed travel to Mars, but that\nperson has not yet been born. The notion of \u2018future contingent\nobjects\u2019 involves important philosophical questions, for\ninstance the issue of ethical obligations towards future generations,\nquantification over \u201cfuture contingent objects\u201d etc.\nHowever, this entry is confined to the study of future contingent\nstatements.\n\nThe problem of future contingents is interwoven with a number of\nissues in theology, philosophy, logic, semantics of natural language,\ncomputer science, and applied mathematics. The theological issue of\nhow to reconcile the assumption of God\u2019s foreknowledge with the\nfreedom and moral accountability of human beings has been a main\nimpetus to the discussion and a major inspiration to the development\nof various logical models of time and future contingents. This\ntheological issue is connected with the general philosophical question\nof determinism versus indeterminism. Within logic, the relation\nbetween time and modality must be studied and various models\nsatisfying various assumptions with respect to the structure of time\nmust be developed and investigated. The project of formal semantics\nfor natural languages also has to address the problem of how to\nascribe a correct semantics to statements about the future. Finally,\nit should be mentioned that temporal logic has found a remarkable\napplication in computer science and applied mathematics (see Hasle and\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2004).\n\nIn the present context the issue of future contingents will be\napproached from the viewpoint of philosophical logic with due\nconsideration to philosophical-theological origins.\n", "toc": [{"#DisFutConBacAncMedLog": "1.

The Discussion of Future Contingency and Its Background in Ancient and Medieval Logic\n\nFuture contingents appear to hold a strange quality when compared with\npresent or past tense statements, such as \u201cit is raining\u201d\nor \u201cNapoleon lost at Waterloo\u201d, whose truth-value does not\ndepend on future states or events. For it seems straightforward to\nclaim that the latter two sentences are true if and only if the states\nor events in question correspond with reality. But can it make sense\nto claim that the truth or falsity of a contingent future statement,\nsuch as \u201cThe first human being to set foot on Mars will be a\nwoman\u201d, depends on the future reality in a similar manner?\nClearly, this can only make sense if we can meaningfully refer to the\nfuture reality in the same way as we can refer to the past reality.\nHowever, if the future is open such a reference may be rather\nproblematic.\n\nThe philosophical and logical challenge to which the future\ncontingency discussion gives rise is two-fold. First of all, anyone\nwho wants to maintain some kind of indeterminism regarding the future,\nmay be confronted with some standard arguments in favor of logical\ndeterminism, i.e., arguments designed to demonstrate that there are no\nfuture contingents at all. In addition, anyone who holds that there\nare future contingents can be challenged to establish a reasonable\ntruth-theory compatible with the idea of an open future. Such a theory\nshould provide answers to questions like: Can one meaningfully regard\nfuture contingents as true or false now, if the future is open? And if\nso, how? Can assertions about the contingent future make any sense at\nall? And if so, how? Some logicians have held that no future\ncontingent is true. However, other logicians have found that this is\nunacceptable. Instead, they have looked for a theoretical basis on\nwhich we might hold that a future contingent is true (or false).\n\nAlready Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.) was aware of the problem of\nfuture contingents. Chapter IX of his work, On\nInterpretation, is without doubt the philosophical text which has\nhad the greatest impact on the debate about the relations between\ntime, truth, and possibility. The discussion in this text certainly\nbears witness to the fact that Ancient philosophy was highly conscious\nof tense-logical problems. Central to the discussion in this famous\nAristotelian text is the question of how to interpret the following\ntwo statements:\n\n\u201cTomorrow there will be a sea-battle\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow there will not be a sea-battle\u201d \n\nAristotle considered questions like: Should we say that one of these\nstatements is true today and the other false? How can we make a clear\ndistinction between what is going to happen tomorrow and what must\nhappen tomorrow? (See On Interpretation, 18 b 23 ff.).\n\nThe interpretative problems regarding Aristotle\u2019s logical\nproblem about the sea-battle tomorrow are by no means simple. Over the\ncenturies, many philosophers and logicians have formulated their\ninterpretations of the Aristotelian text (see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m\nand Hasle 1995, p. 10 ff.). In the following we shall present an\ninterpretation of the text from the scholastic period and a modern\ninterpretation based on a three-valued semantics.\n\nIn the generation after Aristotle, Diodorus Cronus (ca. 340\u2013280\nB.C.E.) analysed similar problems using his so-called Master Argument.\nThis argument was a trilemma. According to Epictetus, Diodorus argued\nthat the following three propositions cannot all be true:\n\n(D1)\nEvery proposition true about the past is necessary.\n(D2)\nAn impossible proposition cannot follow from a possible\n one.[2]\n(D3)\nThere is a proposition which is possible, but which neither is nor\nwill be true.\n\n\nDiodorus used this incompatibility combined with the plausibility of\n(D1) and (D2) to argue that (D3) is false. Assuming (D1) and (D2) he\nwent on to define the possible as \u201cthat which either is or will\nbe true\u201d and the necessary as \u201cthat which, being true,\nwill not be false\u201d. In this way his argument seems to have been\ndesigned to demonstrate that there cannot be any future contingency at\nall. However, little is known about the way in which Diodorus used his\npremises in order to reach the conclusion. The reconstruction of the\nMaster Argument certainly constitutes a genuine problem within the\nhistory of logic. Various philosophers and logicians have tried to\nreconstruct the argument as it might have been. It is very likely that\nthe main structure of the argument was close to the argument presented\nin the next section. (See (\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle 1995, p.\n15 ff.) and (Gaskin 1995) for references to the literature on the\nMaster Argument.)\n\nThe discussion took on a particularly interesting form in the Middle\nAges. During the Middle Ages logicians related their discipline to\ntheology. One of the most important theological questions was the\nproblem of the contingent future in relation to Christian doctrine.\nAccording to Christian tradition, divine foreknowledge comprises\nknowledge of the future choices to be made by men and women. But this\nassumption apparently gives rise to a straightforward argument from\ndivine foreknowledge to the necessity of the future: if God already\nnow knows which decision I will make tomorrow, then a\nnow-unpreventable truth about my choice tomorrow is already given. My\nchoice, then, appears to be necessary, not free. Hence, there seems to\nbe no basis for the claim that I have a free choice between genuine\nalternatives. This conclusion, however, violates the idea of human\nfreedom and moral accountability presupposed in much theology (though\nnot all).\n\nThe medieval discussion regarding the logic of divine foreknowledge\nis, from a formal point of view, very close to the classical\ndiscussion concerning future contingency. If we add the assumption\nthat necessarily, something is true if and only if it is known to God,\nthen it is easy to see how the discussion regarding the logic of\ndivine foreknowledge is, from a formal point of view, essentially the\nsame discussion as the classical discussion concerning future\ncontingency. This was clearly realised by the medieval logicians.\n\nIn his treatise De eventu futurorum, Lavenham (c. 1380) gave\na succinct overview over the basic approaches to the problem within\nscholasticism (see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 1983, Tuggy 1999). Lavenham\nconsidered a central argument leading from God\u2019s foreknowledge\nto the necessity of the future and the lack of proper human freedom.\nIn fact, the various positions on future contingency may be presented\nas possible reactions to this argument. The main structure of this\nargument is very close to what is believed to have been the Master\nArgument of Diodorus Cronus (see Gaskin 1995). It is clear from\nLavenham\u2019s text that he had some knowledge of this old Stoic or\nMegaric argument, probably through his reading of Cicero\u2019s\nDe Fato. The main idea is to transfer the assumed necessity\nof the past to the future. In order to make things clearer one might\nstate the argument in terms of yesterday and tomorrow, instead of past\nand future in general (as Lavenham tends to do). A non-theological\nversion of the argument can be presented in the following way. In this\nsequence E is some event, which may or may not take place tomorrow\n(e.g. a sea-battle). Non-E is just a state of affairs without E\noccurring. E and non-E are supposed to be mutually exclusive.\n\nEither E is going to take place tomorrow or non-E is going to take\nplace tomorrow. (Assumption).\nIf a proposition about the past is true, then it is now necessary,\ni.e., inescapable or unpreventable. (Assumption).\nIf E is going to take place tomorrow, then it is true that\nyesterday it was the case that E would take place in two days.\n(Assumption).\nIf E is going to take place tomorrow, then it is now necessary\nthat yesterday E would take place in two days. (Follows from 2. and\n3.).\nIf it is now necessary that yesterday E would take place in two\ndays, then it is now necessary that E is going to take place tomorrow.\n(Assumption).\nIf E is going to take place tomorrow, then E is necessarily going\nto take place tomorrow. (Follows from 4. and 5.).\nIf non-E is going to take place tomorrow, then non-E is\nnecessarily going to take place tomorrow. (Follows by the same kind of\nreasoning as 6.).\nEither E is necessarily going to take place tomorrow or non-E is\nnecessarily going to take place tomorrow. (Follows from 1., 6. and\n7.).\nTherefore, what is going to happen tomorrow is going to happen\nwith necessity. (Follows from 8.).\n\n\nLavenham accepted the validity of this argument, and he pointed out\nthat one should consider four possible reactions to it. He presented\nthis classification in a theological context, but it can be translated\ninto non-theological language. Assuming that necessarily, something is\ntrue if and only if it is known to God, the four possible reactions in\nLavenham\u2019s analysis can be listed in the following way:\n\nAccept the above argument (including its premises). Grant that\nthere are no future contingents, i.e., statements about the future are\neither impossible or necessary.\nDeny that if a certain event is going to occur, then it is true\nthat it has always been the case that it would occur.\nDeny the following: For any possible event, which might occur at a\ncertain time in the future, either it will be that the event takes\nplace at that future time, or it will be that the event does not take\nplace at that time.\nDeny that the past in general is necessary.\n\n\nClearly, if we don\u2019t want to accept the deterministic conclusion\nof the above argument, and if the argument is accepted as valid, then\nwe have to question at least one of the premises. Not taking premise 5\ninto consideration, this leaves us with the premises 1, 2, and 3.\nAccording to the reaction (b), premise 3 is rejected. Reaction (c)\nimplies the rejection of premise 1 in the argument. Reaction (d)\nimplies the rejection of premise 2.\n\nLavenham took option (a) to imply that there is no human freedom. In\nhis understanding (b) would mean that God does not know future\ncontingents. He rejected both (a) and (b) as contrary to the Christian\nfaith.\n\nIt seems that Lavenham, like William of Ockham (c. 1287\u20131347),\ntook Aristotle to hold that propositions about the contingent future\nare neither true nor false. A number of scholastic logicians favored\nthis Aristotelian view (c), for instance Peter Aureole\n(c.1280\u20131322). Lavenham, however, rejected this view. He\ninsisted that future contingents are either true or false now, and\nthat God knows the truth-values of all future contingents. He\npreferred (d), and he argued that by rejecting the necessity of the\npast as a general principle the doctrines of free will and God\u2019s\nforeknowledge of the contingent future can be united in a consistent\nmanner. This solution was first formulated by Ockham, although some of\nits elements can already be found in Anselm of Canterbury\n(1033\u20131109). It is also interesting that Leibniz\n(1646\u20131711) much later worked with a similar idea as a part of\nhis metaphysics. (See \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 1984.)\n\nThe most characteristic feature of Lavenham\u2019s solution is the\nconcept of the true future. The view is that God possesses certain\nknowledge not only of the necessary future, but also of the contingent\nfuture. This means that among the possible contingent futures there\nmust be one which has a special status, namely that it corresponds to\nthe course of events which is going to happen or take place in the\nfuture. This line of thinking may be called the medieval solution,\neven though other approaches certainly existed. Its justification is\npartly the observation that the notion of the true future is the\nspecifically medieval contribution to the discussion, and partly that\nleading medieval logicians regarded this solution as the best one.\nLavenham himself called it \u201copinio modernorum\u201d, i.e., the\nopinion of the modern people. Lavenham argued that the notion of the\ntrue future can be maintained together with indeterminism, if the\nassumption of the necessity of the past is rejected. This will be\nexplained in more detail in sections 2 and 5.\n\nA later contribution by the Jesuit Luis Molina (1535\u20131600) is\nrelevant for a modern interpretation of the concept of the true\nfuture. Molina\u2019s ideas have been thoroughly discussed in (Craig\n1988). Molina\u2019s special contribution is the idea of\n(God\u2019s) middle knowledge, \u201cby which, in virtue of the most\nprofound and inscrutable comprehension of each free will, He saw in\nHis own essence what each such will would do with its innate freedom\nwere it to be placed in this or that or indeed in infinitely many\norders of things \u2014 even though it would really be able, if it so\nwilled, to do the opposite\u201d (quoted from Craig 1988, p. 175).\nCraig goes on to explain it as follows: \u201c\u2026 whereas by His\nnatural knowledge God knows that, say, Peter when placed in a certain\nset of circumstances could either betray Christ or not betray\nChrist, being free to do either under identical circumstances, by His\nmiddle knowledge God knows what Peter would do if placed\nunder those circumstances\u201d (Craig 1988, p. 175).\n\nAs Lavenham knew, William of Ockham had discussed the problem of\ndivine foreknowledge and human freedom in his work Tractatus de\npraedestinatione et de futuris contingentibus. (See William of\nOckham 1983.) Ockham asserted that God knows the truth or falsity of\nall future contingents, but he also maintained that human beings can\nchoose between alternative possibilities. In his Tractatus he\nargued that the doctrines of divine foreknowledge and human freedom\nare compatible. Richard of Lavenham made a remarkable effort to\ncapture and clearly present the logical features of Ockham\u2019s\nsystem as opposed to (what was assumed to be) Aristotle\u2019s\nsolution, i.e., (c).\n\nIn the following section a formal version of the medieval argument for\ndeterminism will be presented without theological references. It will\nbe demonstrated that at least two of the premises used in the argument\nmay be questioned. In section 3 we shall present a particularly\nimportant framework for the discussion of future contingents known as\nbranching time and its semantics. In sections 4 and 5 we shall see how\nthese possible reactions to the classical argument may be turned into\nmodern truth-theories corresponding to the medieval positions listed\nabove.\n2. A Formalisation of the Classical Argument\n\nThe logic of the expressions \u201ctomorrow\u201d and\n\u201cyesterday\u201d used in section 1 was in fact formalized by\nA.N. Prior (1914\u201369) who suggested that the two terms should be\ntreated as propositional operators, \\(T\\) and \\(Y\\) (1967, p. 67 ff.).\nThis means that \\(T(p)\\) and \\(Y(p)\\) should stand for the\npropositions \u201ctomorrow it will be the case that \\(p\\)\u201d and\n\u201cyesterday it was the case that \\(p\\)\u201d, respectively.\nPrior even suggested some basic axioms for the two operators \n\n\\(p \\supset Y(T(p))\\)\n\\(p \\supset T(Y(p))\\)\n\n\nBy iterative uses of the \\(Y\\)- and \\(T\\)-operators we may define\noperators corresponding to the past and the future as \\(Y^n\\) and\n\\(T^n\\), respectively, where \\(n\\) is an arbitrary natural number.\nObviously, this may be done with an arbitrary choice of time unit,\ni.e., \\(T(p)\\) and \\(Y(p)\\) could simply stand for \u201cat the next\nmoment it will be the case that \\(p\\)\u201d and \u201cat the moment\njust before now it was the case that \\(p\\)\u201d, respectively. A\nlogic of this kind appears to be based on time conceived as a linear\nseries of discrete moments, but Prior pointed out that we may find\nthis sort of discrete tense-logic attractive without committing\nourselves to a strong metaphysical stance regarding time as such: \n\nThe usefulness of systems of this sort does not depend on any serious\nmetaphysical assumption that time is discrete; they are\napplicable in limited fields of discourse in which we are concerned\nonly with what happens next in a sequence of discrete states, e.g. in\nthe workings of a digital computer. (Prior 1967, p. 67)\n\n\nIt should also be mentioned that it is generally assumed that all\nphilosophical and logical aspects of the topic of future contingency\ncan be satisfactory discussed in terms of discrete tense-logic. This\nmeans that regarding the topic of future contingency, we may choose to\nlimit the discussion to the discrete case. On the other hand, in some\ndiscussions there is no reason to make a limitation of this kind.\nPrior based the metric version of his general tense-logical system on\nthe operators:  \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF(x) \\quad & \\ldquo\\text{in } x \\text{ time units it will be the case that } \\ldots\\rdquo \\\\\nP(x) \\quad & \\ldquo x \\text{ time units ago it was the case that } \\ldots\\rdquo \\\\\n\\Box \\quad & \\ldquo\\text{it is necessary that } \\ldots\\rdquo\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nHere the \\(x\\) in the tense operators, \\(F(x)\\) and \\(P(x)\\), does not\nhave to be a natural number, but can take any positive value, allowing\nfor the case that time is non-discrete. Prior showed how the argument\nfrom section 1 can be formalized in terms of this general\ntense-logic.\n\nIt should, however, be noted that Prior also often used\ntense-operators without any reference to time units. He used \\(F\\) for\n\u201cit will be the case that \u2026\u201d and \\(P\\) for\n\u201cit has been the case that \u2026\u201d. In terms of these\nnon-metric tense-operators he defined the operators, \\(G\\) and \\(H\\),\nas \\({\\sim}F{\\sim}\\) and \\({\\sim}P{\\sim}\\) respectively. \\(G\\) may be\nread \u201cit will always be the case that \u2026\u201d, and \\(H\\)\nmay be read \u201cit has always been the case that \u2026\u201d.\nUsing these non-metric tense-operators Prior (1967, p. 32 ff.) even\nformulated a reconstruction of the Diodorean Master Argument which\ncomes rather close to the classical argument which we shall present in\nthe following.\n\nIt is essential to notice that the necessity at stake in the classical\nargument is a historical necessity. This means that what is not\nnecessary at one moment may become necessary at another moment.\nInstead of speaking about what is necessary we might \u2013 as\nalready hinted at \u2013 talk about what is now settled, inevitable,\ninescapable, or unpreventable.\n\nThe argument may be understood as based on the following five\nprinciples, where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) represent arbitrary well-formed\nstatements within the logic:\n\n(P1)\n\\(F(y)p \\supset P(x)F(x)F(y)p\\)\n(P2)\n\\(\\Box(P(x)F(x)p \\supset p)\\)\n(P3)\n\\(P(x)p \\supset \\Box P(x)p\\)\n(P4)\n\\((\\Box(p \\supset q) \\wedge \\Box p) \\supset \\Box q\\)\n(P5)\n\\(F(x)p \\vee F(x){\\sim}p\\)\n\n\n(P1) and (P2) are basic tense-logical claims which can serve as\ncrucial elements in a formalization of the argument mentioned in\nsection 1. (P3) may be labeled the \u2018necessity of the\npast\u2019. (P4) is a theorem well-known from standard modal logic.\n(P5) may be read as a version of the principle of the excluded middle\n(\u201ctertium non datur\u201d), although it does not take the exact\nform of \\(p \\vee{\\sim}p\\). In order to avoid confusion, we shall use\nthe modified name, \u2018future excluded middle\u2019, for (P5).\n\nLet \\(q\\) stand for some atomic statement such that \\(F(y)q\\) is a\nstatement about the contingent future. Formally, then, the argument\ngoes as follows:\n\n\n(1)\n\\(F(y)q \\supset P(x)F(x)F(y)q\\)\n(P1) \n\n(2)\n\\(P(x)F(x)F(y)q \\supset \\Box P(x)F(x)F(y)q\\)\n(from (P3)) \n\n(3)\n\\(F(y)q \\supset \\Box P(x)F(x)F(y)q\\)\n(from (1) & (2)) \n\n(4)\n\\(\\Box(P(x)F(x)F(y)q \\supset F(y)q)\\)\n(from (P2)) \n\n(5)\n\\(F(y)q \\supset \\Box F(y)q\\)\n(from (3), (4), (P4)) \n\n\nSimilarly, it is possible to prove\n\n\n(6)\n\\(F(y){\\sim}q \\supset \\Box F(y){\\sim}q\\)\n\u00a0 \n\n\nThe second part of the main proof is carried out in the following\nway:\n\n\n(7)\n\\(F(y)q \\vee F(y){\\sim}q\\)\n(from (P5)) \n\n(8)\n\\(\\Box F(y)q \\vee \\Box F(y){\\sim}q\\)\n(from (5), (6), (7)) \n\n\nRemember now that \\(q\\) may stand for any atomic proposition,\nincluding statements about human actions. Therefore, (8) is equivalent\nto a claim of determinism, i.e., that there are no future contingents.\nSo if one wants to preserve indeterminism, at least one of the above\nprinciples (P1\u20135) has to be rejected.\n\nA.N. Prior constructed two systems showing how that can be done,\nnamely the Peircean system (in which (P1) and (P5) are rejected) and\nthe Ockhamist system (in which (P3) is rejected). Formally, each of\nthese systems offers a basis for the rejection of the claim of\ndeterminism as expressed in (8). As we shall see in the next section\nthe same can be said about Jan \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s three-valued\nsemantics, which Prior himself investigated further (see Prior 1953),\nand which also involves a rejection of (P5). Since Prior, several\nphilosophers have discussed which one of these systems should be\naccepted, or whether other and more attractive systems dealing with\nthe problem can be constructed. In sections 4 and 5 we shall see how\nthe various solutions to the problem of future contingents can be\ngrouped according to their consequences with respect to (P3) and\n(P5).\n3. Branching Time Semantics\n\nSince Prior\u2019s time, it has become a standard to study\ntense-logical systems in terms of semantical models based on the idea\nof branching time. This idea was not realised in Prior\u2019s early\nworks on temporal logic. Indeed it had not yet been formulated in his\nTime and Modality (1957), which otherwise marked the major\nbreakthrough of the new logic of time. As an explicit (or formalised)\nidea, branching time was first suggested to Prior in a letter from\nSaul Kripke in September 1958. This letter contains an initial version\nof the idea and a system of branching time, although it was not worked\nout in details. Kripke, who was then only 17 years old, suggested that\nwe may consider the present as a point of Rank 1, and possible events\nor states at the next moment as points of Rank 2; for every such\npossible state in turn, there would be various possible future states\nat the next moment from Rank 3, the set of which could be labelled\nRank 4, and so forth. Kripke wrote:\n\n\nNow in an indetermined system, we perhaps should not regard time as a\nlinear series, as you have done. Given the present moment, there are\nseveral possibilities for what the next moment may be like \u2013 and\nfor each possible next moment, there are several possibilities for the\nnext moment after that. Thus the situation takes the form, not of a\nlinear sequence, but of a \u201ctree\u201d\u2026 [Letter from Saul\nKripke to A.N. Prior, dated September 3, 1958, kept in the Prior\nCollection at Bodleian Library, Oxford, Box 4. See also Ploug et al.\n2012.]\n\n\nIn this way it is possible to form a tree structure representing the\nentire set of possible futures expanding from the present (Rank 1)\n\u2013 indeed a set of possible futures can be said to be identified\nfor any state, or node in the tree. In this structure every point\ndetermines a subtree consisting of its own present and possible\nfutures. Kripke illustrated this idea in the following way:\n\n\n\n\nIn the letter Kripke wrote:\n\nThe point 0 (or origin) is the present, and the points 1, 2, and 3 (of\nrank 2) are the possibilities for the next moment. If the point 1\nactually does come to pass, 4, 5, and 6 are its possible successors,\nand so on. The whole tree then represents the entire set of\npossibilities for present and future; and every point determines a\nsubtree consisting of its own present and future.\n\n\nIn Prior\u2019s opinion the notion of branching time is certainly not\nunproblematic. After all it is a representation of time in terms of\nspace. The notion seems to involve the idea that the \u201cNow\u201d\nis moving through the system. Several authors have argued that the\npicture of a moving point within the branching time system is rather\nproblematic. In fact, this problem of the \u201cNow\u201d as a\nmoving point goes back to Jack Smart (1949). Later it has been debated\nby Storrs McCall (1976, p. 348, 1995) and Graham Nerlich (1995).\nRecently MacFarlane has pointed out that there is nothing such a\nmotion could represent, since we have already represented time as one\nof the spatial dimensions of the tree (MacFarlane 2008, p. 86).\n\nIt seems that Prior right from the beginning was aware of the basic\nconceptual problems involved in the notion of branching time. However,\nhe certainly found this notion useful as long as it is applied\ncarefully. During the 1960s he substantially developed the idea. He\nworked out the formal details of several different systems, which\nconstitute different and even competing interpretations of the idea of\nbranching time, as we shall see below.\n\nA tense-logical model (TIME,\\(\\le\\),C,\\(\\TRUE\\)) based on a branching\ntime system is a structure, where (TIME,\\(\\le)\\) is a partially\nordered set of moments of time, and C is a set of so-called histories\nor chronicles i.e., maximally ordered linear subsets in\n(TIME,\\(\\le)\\). It is standard procedure how to define \u201c=\u201d\nand \u201c\\(\\lt\\)\u201d in terms of \u201c\\(\\le\\)\u201d. The\nbefore/after relation, \\(\\lt\\), is supposed to be irreflexive,\nasymmetric, transitive and backwards linear. Backwards linearity means\n\u201cno backwards branching\u201d i.e. \n\n\\[\n(t_1 \\lt t_0 \\wedge t_2 \\lt t_0) \\supset (t_1 \\lt t_2 \\vee t_2 \\lt t_1 \\vee t_2 = t_1)\n\\]\n\n\nfor all moments of time \\(t_0, t_1\\), and \\(t_2\\). This means that the\npast relative to \\(t_0\\), PAST\\((t_0)\\), i.e., the set \\(\\{t \\mid t\n\\lt t_0\\}\\), is linear. In consequence, PAST\\((t_0)\\) will be a subset\nof any chronicle through \\(t_0\\). Much more on the mathematics of\npartially ordered sets and their use in temporal logic can be found in\n(van Benthem 1991, in particular in Part I). \n\nIn addition, historical connectedness may be considered as an axiom,\ni.e., it may be assumed that \\(c_1 \\cap c_2 \\ne \\varnothing,\\) for any\ntwo chronicles \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) in the branching time system.\n\nIn many branching time models C will just be the set of all maximally\nordered linear subsets in (TIME,\\(\\le)\\). In such cases C will not be\nan independent parameter of the model. In other cases, however, there\nwill be some additional restrictions on C, i.e., it will be a proper\nsubset of the set of all maximally ordered linear subsets in\n(TIME,\\(\\le)\\). In some branching time models there will also be\nintroduced a relation of (counterfactually) co-temporaneous moments.\nGiven that such a relation is an equivalence relation, it may give\nrise to the definition of instants as equivalence classes of\nco-temporaneous moments.\n\nFor any propositional constant, \\(p\\), and any moment in TIME, \\(t\\),\nthere is a truth-value, \\(\\TRUE(p,t)\\). This means that the\ntruth-value of a propositional constant does not vary with the\nchronicles. The truth-value of a propositional constant depends only\non the moment. On this basis the truth-value of any well formed\nformula (wff) has to be defined recursively. In the following sections\nwe shall see that this can be done in several different ways.\n\nIt may, however, be objected that it is problematic to operate with\ntwo different kinds of propositions: 1) propositional constants with\ntruth-values that do not vary with the chronicles and 2) other wffs\nwith truth-values that may vary with the chronicles. Thomason (1970,\np. 280) has pointed out that this distinction means that substitution\nof propositions in the system will have to be restricted, since we\nwill not be allowed to substitute a propositional constant with an\narbitrary wff. Prior was aware of this, but he argued that it is in\nfact possible to handle a system with restrictions on the\nsubstitution-rules. (See Prior 1967, p. 122 ff.)\n4. The Solutions Based on Rejection of the Principle of Future Excluded Middle\n\nA truth-theory may involve the rejection of the principle of future\nexcluded middle, (P5), for at least two different reasons:\n\nThe theory may imply that future contingents are neither true nor\nfalse, but undetermined (often conceived as a third truth-value).\nThe theory may be based on the idea that all future contingents\nare false.\n\n\nA possible third position would be to maintain that all future\ncontingents are true. Strictly speaking, such a claim does not\ncontradict (P5) as mentioned in section 2, although it does in fact\ncontradict a version of (P5) formulated in terms of an exclusive\ndisjunction. However, from a philosophical point of view, such a claim\nhas had no serious role to play in the debate, even though the\nassumption of all future contingents being true is in fact what holds\nin the early tense-logical systems, \\(\\mathrm{K}_t\\) and\n\\(\\mathrm{K}_b\\), introduced in (Prior 1967, p. 187) and in (Rescher\nand Urquhart, p. 68 ff.). The problem is that it is highly\ncounter-intuitive to accept both \u201cTomorrow there will be a\nsea-battle\u201d and \u201cTomorrow there will not be a\nsea-battle\u201d as true now. It seems that if one of these\npropositions is true now, then the other has to be false. On these\ngrounds, we shall not consider this possibility any further in this\ncontext.\n\nIn the two following subsections, we shall briefly consider some\nsolutions corresponding to the possibilities 1 and 2 mentioned\nabove.\n4.1 Jan \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s Three-valued Semantics\n\nIn a series of articles during the 1920s and 30s the Polish logician\nJan \u0141ukasiewicz (1878\u20131956) advocated a particular\ninterpretation of Aristotle\u2019s discussion of the status of\nsentences about the contingent future, as developed in his sea-battle\nexample. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s interpretation crucially rests on a\nrejection of the principle of bivalence. In fact, this kind of\ninterpretation was not new, but had been formulated already by the\nEpicureans. However, \u0141ukasiewicz presented this position more\nclearly than had ever been done before, and developed it with the aid\nof modern symbolic logic. He used his interpretation of Aristotle and\nthe status of sentences about the contingent future as an argument\nagainst logical determinism and in favor of logical indeterminism, for\nwhich he declared his wholehearted support. In order to avoid\ndeterminism, he found it necessary to restrict the validity of\nbivalence by introducing a third truth-value. This truth-value,\n\u201cundetermined\u201d, is applied to contingent propositions\nregarding the future (McCall 1967, p. 64). For instance, a proposition\nstating that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow can be assigned the\ntruth-value undetermined today. This is because today it is not given\nor definitely determined whether the sea-battle is actually going to\ntake place tomorrow or not.\n\nIt is an important property of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s three-valued\nlogic that the truth-value of the disjunction of two undetermined\npropositions is undetermined, i.e., \\((p \\vee q)\\) is undetermined for\n\\(p\\) undetermined and \\(q\\) undetermined. This may be based on the\nobservation that since \\(p \\equiv(p \\vee p)\\), a disjunction of two\nundetermined propositions has to be undetermined. If \\(p\\) is\nundetermined, \\({\\sim}p\\) is also undetermined. It follows that \\((p\n\\vee{\\sim}p)\\) is undetermined for \\(p\\) undetermined. This problem\nalso occurs for future contingents such as \\(F(x)q\\) and\n\\(F(x){\\sim}q\\). According to \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s trivalent logic:\nif \\(F(x)q\\) and \\(F(x){\\sim}q\\) are two future contingents, i.e., if\nthey are both undetermined, then the same will be the case for the\ndisjunction of the two statements, \\(F(x)q \\vee F(x){\\sim}q\\). This\nmeans that the theory leads to the rejection of the principle of\n(P5).\n\nIn general, it does not seem possible to solve the problem of future\ncontingents in terms of three-valued semantics in a satisfactory\nmanner if the logic is truth-functional, i.e., if the truth-value of\nany proposition used in the logic is determined by the truth-values of\nits parts. As argued by Prior (1953, p. 326) it will not help to\nchange the truth-tables to something different from\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s model. As long as the model or theory is\ntruth-functional, it is obvious that the two disjunctions \\((F(x)q\n\\vee{\\sim}F(x)q)\\) and \\((F(x)q \\vee F(x)q)\\) will have the same\ntruth-value. From an intuitive and common sense point of view, this is\nnot satisfactory, since \\((F(x)q \\vee{\\sim}F(x)q)\\) is clearly true,\nwhereas \\((F(x)q \\vee F(x)q)\\) is undetermined, given that \\(F(x)q\\)\nis undetermined.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s interpretation of the Aristotelian text was\ndisputed by Prior (1962, p.240 ff.), who pointed out that there is a\nsignificant difference between \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s trivalent logic\nand Aristotle\u2019s text. Prior pointed out that according to\nAristotle it is true already today, that either there will\n\\(or\\) there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow, whereas this\ndisjunction, as just mentioned, is undetermined according to\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s trivalent logic.\n4.2 The Peircean Solution\n\nThe solution Prior himself favored is based on so-called Peircean\nmodels. Prior demonstrated that the semantics of these models can be\npresented in two different ways. In the following we shall concentrate\non the first of these possibilities, but also comment briefly on the\nother possible approach to the Peircean solution.\n\nIn order to define the Peircean models according to Prior\u2019s\nfirst attempt, it is assumed that there is a valuation function,\nTRUE, which gives a truth-value (0 or 1) for any\npropositional constant at any moment in TIME. On this basis, the\nvaluation function of a Peircean model, \\(\\Peirce(t,c,p)\\) can be\ndefined recursively for any wff \\(p\\), any moment of time \\(t\\) and\nany chronicle \\(c\\) with \\(t \\in c\\):\n\n\n(a)\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c, p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(\\TRUE(p,t)=1\\), where \\(p\\) is any propositional\nconstant. \n\n(b)\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c, p\\wedge q)=1\\)\niff\nboth \\(\\Peirce(t,c,p)=1\\) and \\(\\Peirce(t,c,q) =1\\) \n\n(c)\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c,{\\sim}p)=1\\)\niff\nnot \\(\\Peirce(t,c,p)=1\\) \n\n(d)\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c,Fp) =1\\)\niff\n for all \\(c'\\) with \\(t \\in c'\\) there is some \\(t' \\in c'\\)\nwith \\(t \\lt t'\\) such that \\(\\Peirce(t',c',p) = 1\\) \n\n(e)\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c,Pp)=1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Peirce(t',c,p)=1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(t' \\lt\nt\\) \n\n(f)\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c,\\Diamond p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c',p) =1\\) for some \\(c'\\) with \\(t \\in c'\\)\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking, (a)\u2013(f) do not define the function\n\\(Peirce\\). These conditions only explain when \\(Peirce\\) has the\nvalue 1. However, here and in all models below we assume that the\nvaluation function has the range \\(\\{0,1\\}\\). The value is 0, if it\ndoes not follow from the recursive definition that it is 1.\n\nIn the Peircean system another future operator corresponding to the\nnotion of \u201cpossible future\u201d may also be defined, i.e.,\n\n\n(g)\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c,fp) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Peirce(t',c',p) = 1\\) for some \\(c'\\) with \\(t \\in c'\\) and\nsome \\(t' \\in c'\\) with \\(t \\lt t'\\) \n\n\nIn addition, \\(G\\) may be defined as \\({\\sim}f{\\sim}\\) and \\(g\\) as\n\\({\\sim}F{\\sim}\\). In this way the Peircean system comprises four\ndifferent future-oriented operators \\((f, g, F, G)\\).\n\nIt should also be mentioned that we can define the necessity operator,\n\\(\\Box\\), in the usual manner, i.e., as \\({\\sim} \\Diamond{\\sim}\\).\n\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c,q) = 1\\) can be read \u2018\\(q\\) is true at \\(t\\) in\nthe chronicle \\(c\\)\u2019. A formula \\(q\\) is said to be Peirce-valid\nif and only if \\(\\Peirce(t,c,q) = 1\\) for any \\(t\\) in any \\(c\\) in\nany branching time structure (TIME,\\(\\le\\),C) and any valuation\nfunction TRUE.\n\nTo obtain a metric version of the Peircean system, a duration function\nhas to be added. Let \\(\\dur(t_1,t_2,x)\\) stand for the statement\n\u2018\\(t_1\\) is \\(x\\) time units before \\(t_2\\)\u2019, where\n\\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) belong to the same chronicle, and where \\(x\\) is a\npositive\n number[3].\n Using this function (d) and (e) above are replaced by:\n\n\n\\((\\text{d}')\\)\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c,F(x)p) = 1\\)\niff\nfor all \\(c'\\) with \\(t \\in c'\\) there is some \\(t' \\in c'\\)\nwith \\(\\dur(t,t',x)\\) such that \\(\\Peirce(t',c',p) = 1\\) \n\n\\((\\text{e}')\\)\n\\(\\Peirce(t,c,P(x)p) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Peirce(t',c,p) = 1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(\\dur(t',t,x)\\) \n\n\nGiven the truth clauses (a)\u2013(e), the modality introduced in (f)\nis rather trivial. For instance it follows that \n\n\\[\nF(x)q \\supset \\Box F(x)q\n\\]\n\n\nis a Peirce-valid formula. This means that a statement about the\nfuture is true in the Peircean sense only if it is true in all\npossible futures, i.e., only if it has to be the case. It\nfollows that if \\(F(x)q\\) is a future contingent, it will be false\naccording to the theory. The same will be the case for\n\\(F(x){\\sim}q\\). For this reason  \n\n\\[\nF(x)q \\vee F(x){\\sim}q\n\\]\n\n\nwill also be false. So the principle of future excluded middle, (P5),\nis not a thesis in the system.\n\nIt may be objected that the use of the parameter \\(c\\) is not really\nneeded in the definition of the Peirce-function. Clearly, it has no\nrole to play neither in (a)\u2013(e) nor in (g). The parameter is in\nfact used in (f), but this may be said to be rather unimportant, since\nas indicated above necessity is in fact incorporated in the Peircean\nnotion of future. Based on such considerations Prior (1967, p. 132\nff.) showed that the Peircean models may in fact be defined in terms\nof a simpler Peirce-function without any reference to the parameter\n\\(c\\) (i.e. the chronicles), if it is assumed that (f) can be left out\nof the Peircean system in question. The main advantage of keeping the\nextended formalism, is that it facilitates its comparison with the\nsystem to be presented in section 5.1.\n\nAccording to the Peircean system the future should simply be\nidentified with the necessary future. More precisely, to say something\nabout the future is to say something about the necessary future.\nAlthough the identification of the future with the necessary future\nmakes the position counter-intuitive, A.N. Prior and many of his\nfollowers favored this possibility. The reason is that Prior strongly\nbelieved in free choice and held that this freedom is essential for\nthe understanding of the very notion of future. According to Prior\nnobody (not even God) can know what a person will freely choose,\nbefore the person has made his or her choice. So whatever could make a\nstatement about a future choice by some free agent true now? From\nPrior\u2019s point of view, nothing. Hence, such statements must be\nfalse. In his Some Free Thinking about Time, Prior maintained\nthat \u201cif something is the work of a free agent, then it\nwasn\u2019t going to be the case until that agent decided that it\nwas\u201d (Copeland 1996, p.48).\n\nConsider the consequences of (d\\(')\\) and (e\\(')\\) when applied to the\nfollowing model:\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the Peircean position implies that \\(F(y)p\\) is true at\n\\(t_2\\), whereas \\(F(x)F(y)p\\) is false at \\(t_1\\) and\n\\(P(x)F(x)F(y)p\\) is consequently false at \\(t_2\\). This means that\n(P1) must be rejected in this system.\n\nIn general the formula \n\n\\[\nq \\supset P(z)F(z)q\n\\]\n\n\nis not Peirce-valid.\n\nIt can be concluded that in the Peircean system both (P1) and (P5)\nmust be rejected.\n\nMany researchers have studied the formalities of the Peircean system.\nAxiomatizations of the non-metrical version of the system can be found\nin (Burgess 1980) and in (Zanardo 1990).\n5. The Solutions Based on the Rejection of the Necessity of the Past\n\nAs argued for instance in (Gabbay et al. 2000, p. 65), the\nPeircean system has some obvious weaknesses, which make the system\nproblematic as a satisfactory candidate for a theory of future\ncontingency. First of all, the system fails to represent many\ncommon-sense notions of time, which are arguably reasonable. This is\ndue to the fact that the idea of a plain future as a \u2018middle\nground\u2019 between possible future and necessary future cannot be\nexpressed in the Peircean system. Suppose I say:\n\n\u201cIt will be sunny in London tomorrow\u201d\n\n\nI do not mean that tomorrow perhaps will be sunny in London,\nor maybe not; I mean that indeed it will be the case; but on the other\nhand I do not mean that there is no other option, or that it must be\nso. One should be aware that in adopting the Peircean system, one\nwould have to consider this everyday intuition illusory \u2014 there\nreally is only the \u201cpossibly\u201d, or the\n\u201cnecessarily\u201d (corresponding to \\(fp\\) and \\(Fp\\)\nmentioned in the (g) and (d) clauses in section 4.2). In fact,\nlogically speaking, in this system \u201cit will be sunny in London\ntomorrow\u201d would have to be considered as equivalent to\neither\n\n\u201cPossibly, it will be sunny in London tomorrow\u201d\n\n\nor\n\n\u201cNecessarily, it will be sunny in London tomorrow\u201d.\n\n\nIn addition, it should be noticed that it is a crucial feature of the\nPericean system that the expressions \\(F(x){\\sim}q\\) and\n\\({\\sim}F(x)q\\) are non-equivalent. This certainly gives rise to a\nserious challenge when confronted with everyday intuition. In fact, it\nis rather difficult to make a clear distinction between the two\nexpressions in terms of natural language. E.g. it is doubtable whether\na distinction between \u201ctomorrow it will not be sunny in\nLondon\u201d and \u201cit is not the case that tomorrow will be\nsunny in London\u201d will be accepted as sufficiently clear.\n\nFor such reasons many scholars have found it rather problematic to\nreject (P5). Instead they have focused on systems accepting (P5) but\nrejecting (P3). In the following we shall consider five such\ntheories.\n5.1 Prior\u2019s Ockhamist Solution\n\nIn Past, Present and Future Prior presented his so-called\nOckhamist system, which accepts (P5) but rejects (P3) (see Prior 1967,\np. 126 ff.). This system is inspired by some of the ideas formulated\nby William of Ockham.\n\nAs with the Peircean semantics, it is assumed that there is a\ntruth-function, TRUE, which gives a truth-value (0 or 1) for\nany propositional constant at any moment in TIME. On this basis, the\nvaluation function of an Ockhamist model, \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)\\) can be\ndefined recursively for any wff \\(p\\), any moment of time \\(t\\), and\nany chronicle \\(c\\) with \\(t \\in c\\):\n\n\n(a)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(\\TRUE(p,t)=1\\), where \\(p\\) is any propositional constant. \n\n(b)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,p\\wedge q)=1\\)\niff\nboth \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)=1\\) and \\(\\Ock(t,c,q)=1\\) \n\n(c)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,{\\sim}p)=1\\)\niff\nnot \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)=1\\) \n\n(d)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,Fp)=1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t',c,p)=1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(t \\lt t'\\)\n\n\n(e)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,Pp) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t',c,p)=1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(t' \\lt t\\)\n\n\n(f)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,\\Diamond p) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t,c',p)=1\\) for some \\(c' \\in C(t)\\) \n\n\nHere \\(C(t)\\) is defined as the set of chronicles through \\(t\\), i.e.,\n\\(C(t) = \\{c\\mid  t \\in c\\}\\).\n\nWe define the dual operators, \\(H, G\\), and \\(\\Box\\) in the usual\nmanner as \\({\\sim}P{\\sim}, {\\sim}F{\\sim}\\), and \\({\\sim}\n\\Diamond{\\sim}\\) respectively.\n\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,p) = 1\\) can be read \u2018\\(p\\) is true at \\(t\\) in the\nchronicle \\(c\\)\u2019. A formula \\(p\\) is said to be Ockham-valid if\nand only if \\(\\Ock(t,c,p) = 1\\) for any \\(t\\) in any \\(c\\) in any\nbranching time structure, (TIME,\\(\\le\\),C) and any valuation function\nTRUE. Here C should not be taken as an independent parameter.\nIn this case C is just the set of all maximally ordered linear subsets\nin (TIME,\\(\\le)\\). Furthermore, it should be noted that relative to a\nsingle chronicle, (a)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(e) are exactly the same\ndefinitions as those used in linear tense-logic (i.e. the tense-logic\nwhich follows if (TIME,\\(\\le)\\) is a linear structure).\n\nPrior himself did not accept the view represented in the Ockhamist\nsystem, but as many later researchers he was interested in the\nexploration of the system. It should be mentioned that the basic views\nheld by Belnap et al. (2001) are in fact rather close to\nPriorean Ockhamism, although there are certainly many further\ndevelopments of the theory in Belnap\u2019s philosophical writings on\nthe subject (Belnap 1992, 2002, 2003, 2005). Belnap has strongly\nemphasized the distinction between what he calls \u2018plain\ntruth\u2019 and \u201csettled truth\u201d. Whereas plain truth\ncorresponds to the branch-dependent truth used in the Ockhamistic\nmodel, settled truth will be branch-independent, i.e., truth at a\nmoment of time. It should also be pointed out that in the definition\nof \\(Ock\\), only (d) differs from the corresponding Peircean\ndefinition. In fact, Prior (1967, p.130) has pointed out that the\nPeircean system may be seen as a fragment of the Ockhamistic system in\nwhich \\(F\\) does not occur except as immediately preceded by an\nnecessity operator.\n\nTo obtain a metric version of the Ockhamist system, a duration\nfunction has to be added. Let \\(\\dur(t_1,t_2,x)\\) stand for the\nstatement \u2018\\(t_1\\) is \\(x\\) time units before \\(t_2\\)\u2019.\nUsing this formalism, (d) and (e) are replaced by:\n\n\n\\((\\text{d}')\\)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,F(x)p) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t',c,p) = 1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(\\dur(t,t',x)\\) \n\n\\((\\text{e}')\\)\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,P(x)p) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\Ock(t',c,p) = 1\\) for some \\(t' \\in c\\) with \\(\\dur(t',t,x)\\) \n\n\nIt can be verified that neither \\(P(x)q \\supset \\Box P(x)q\\) nor \\(Pq\n\\supset \\Box Pq\\) are Ockham-valid for all \\(q\\). Let for instance\n\\(q\\) stand for \\(F(y)p\\). It is easy to verify that \\(P(x)F(y)p\n\\supset \\Box P(x)F(y)p\\) will not in general hold in an Ockhamistic\nbranching time model. This may be illustrated using the following\ndiagram, in which it is easily seen that \\(\\Ock(t, c_1, P(x)F(y)p) =\n1\\), whereas \\(\\Ock(t, c_1, \\Box P(x)F(y)p) = 0\\) since \\(\\Ock(t, c_2,\nP(x)F(y)p) = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nThis does away with (P3) in the formal version of the medieval\nargument discussed above. Still, both formulas, \\(P(x)q \\supset \\Box\nP(x)q\\) and \\(Pq \\supset \\Box Pq\\), will hold if the truth of \\(q\\)\ndoes not depend on what the future brings.\n\nIf (P3) does not hold in general, one may reject (2) in the argument\nin section 2. According to Ockham, (P3) (that is, its verbal analogue\nas he could formulate it with the means then available) should only be\naccepted for statements which are genuinely about the past, i.e.,\nwhich do not depend on the future. According to this view, (P3) may be\ndenied precisely because the truth of statements like\n\\(P(x)F(x)F(y)q\\) has not been settled yet \u2014 since they depend\non the future.\n\nIn this way, one can make a distinction between \u201csoft\nfacts\u201d and \u201chard facts\u201d regarding the past (see\nPlantinga 1986; de Florio and Frigerio 2016). Following the Ockhamist\nposition, a statement like \\(P(x)q\\) would correspond to a hard fact,\nif \\(q\\) does not depend on the future, whereas statements like\n\\(P(x)F(x)F(y)q\\) would represent soft facts. Critics of the Ockhamist\nposition, however, may still say that if \\(F(x)F(y)q\\) was true \\(x\\)\ntime units ago, then there must have been something making it true at\nthat time, and that something must have been a hard fact. On the other\nhand, supporters of the position hold that it is fully conceivable and\nacceptable that what makes a statement true could also be a soft fact,\ni.e., something which depends on the future.\n\nThe rationality of Ockham\u2019s suggestion according to which future\nhappenings can (in a very limited sense) influence the past, has been\ndefended by Alvin Plantinga (1986). It should also be mentioned that\nOckham\u2019s theory is relevant for the conceptual analysis of the\nidea of prophecy (see the entry on\n prophecy).\n\nHowever, it may be disputed that Prior\u2019s Ockhamist system fits\nthe ideas formulated by William of Ockham completely. Although many of\nOckham\u2019s original ideas are satisfactorily modelled in\nPrior\u2019s Ockhamist system, Prior\u2019s system (1967) lacks a\nproper representation of the notion of \u2018the true\n future\u2019.[4]\n This was in fact one of the most basic ideas in Ockham\u2019s world\nview. Ockham believed that there is truth (or falsity) also of\nstatements about the contingent future, which human beings cannot\nknow, but which God knows. Prior\u2019s Ockhamist system cannot be\nsaid to include more than the idea of a proposition being true\nrelative to a moment of time and a chronicle. A proper theory in\naccordance with William of Ockham\u2019s ideas would have to include\nthe idea of a proposition being true relative to a moment of time\n(without any specification of a chronicle). Let us therefore\ninvestigate a truth-theory which includes the idea of a true future in\nthis sense.\n5.2 The Leibnizian Theory\n\nAn alternative approach to the semantics for future contingents is\ninspired by the works of Leibniz and has been called a Leibnizian\nsemantics (see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle 1995). According to\nthis view the set of possible histories is not seen as a traditional\ntree structure, but as a system of \u201cparallel lines\u201d. On\nthe set of \u201cparallel lines\u201d a relation corresponding to\nqualitative identity up to a certain instant is defined. In\nsuch a model it will be straightforward to introduce truth-values for\nfuture contingents.\n\nThe idea can be introduced in terms of Prior\u2019s Ockhamistic\nmodel. As mentioned above any maximally ordered linear subset in\n(TIME,\\(\\le)\\) will be accepted as a chronicle in the Ockhamistic\nmodel. However, in the Leibnizian model only some of these subsets\nwill be accepted as chronicles, although the union of all chronicles\nwill still be the full set TIME, i.e., any moment will belong to at\nleast one Leibnizian chronicle. The set of \u201cparallel\nlines\u201d in the system may just be a subset of the set of all\nchronicles considered in the Ockhamistic model. Formally, each\ntemporal moment in the Leibnizian semantics corresponds to a pair of a\nmoment of time, \\(m\\), and a chronicle, \\(c\\), with \\(m \\in c\\). This\nmeans that any Leibnizian time can be written as a structured formal\nobject \\(\\temp(m,c)\\), where \\(m \\in c\\). The Leibnizian valuation\nfunction can be defined in terms of Prior\u2019s Ockhamistic model in\nthe following way: \n\n\\[\n\\textit{Leib}(\\textit{temp}(m,c),p) = \\Ock(m,c,p)\n\\]\n\n\nFormally, this means that in the Leibnizian semantics the truth-value\nof a proposition only depends on the Leibnizian time. According to\nthis semantics (P3) is obviously not valid in general.\n\nA semantics introduced in this manner also fits with models defined in\nterms of so-called bundled trees (see Zanardo 2003), and it is similar\nto the approach taken by David K. Lewis in his On the Plurality of\nWorlds (1986).\n\nOn the Leibnizian view \\(p \\supset P(x)F(x)p\\) holds, whereas \\(p\n\\supset P(x)\\Box F(x)p\\) does not hold. This may be illustrated in the\nfollowing way:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\\(_1 ' =\\) temp(m\\(_1\\),c\\(')\\)\n\nt\\(_1 =\\) temp(m\\(_1\\),c)\n\nt\\(_2 ' =\\) temp(m\\(_2 '\\),c\\(')\\)\n\nt\\(_2 =\\) temp(m\\(_2\\),c)\n \n\n\nThis diagram illustrates that chronicles may be represented as\nparallel lines up to a certain temporal instant (containing both \\(t_1\n= \\temp(m_1,c)\\) and \\(t_1 ' =\\temp(m_1,c'))\\), from where they\ndiverge. Until the \u201cbranching point\u201d the chronicles are\nindistinguishable.\n\nAccording to a Leibnizian semantics propositions without modal\noperators, such as \\(p \\supset P(x)F(x)p\\), will have to be evaluated\nwithin the sub-model defined by the chronicle (i.e., in fact a linear\nmodel). The point is that to determine the truth-value of a formula\nwithout modals at a Leibnizian time defined as \\(t =\\temp(m,c)\\), one\nneed not look at other chronicles than \\(c\\) if the evaluation is\ngoing to take place on the basis of Leibnizian semantics. However, in\nthe above model the proposition \\(p \\supset P(x)\\Box F(x)p\\) will not\nbe true at \\(t_2 =\\temp(m_2,c)\\) since even if \\(p\\) is true at\n\\(t_2\\) and \\(t_1 =\\temp(m_1,c)\\) is a time \\(x\\) time units earlier\nearlier than \\(t_2\\), the proposition \\(\\Box F(x)p\\) will be false at\n\\(t_1\\), since there is a co-temporal moment \\(t_1 '\\) at which\n\\(F(x)p\\) is false.\n\nFrom a formal point of view the semantics of the Leibnizian theory may\nbe seen as an alternative interpretation of the semantics of the\nOckhamist theory with the only difference that in the Leibnizian\ntheory not all maximal linear subsets have to be accepted as proper\nchronicles in the model.\n\nSome philosophers have argued that the Leibnizian theory at least in\nsome cases seem to be more plausible from an intuitive point of view\nthan the Ockhamistic theory. The reason is that there exist some\nrather intricate propositions which some hold to be intuitively\ninvalid, which they are according to the Leibnizian theory, although\nthey are valid according to the Ockhamist theory. One such example can\nbe given in terms of these two statements:\n\n\n\\(p_1{:}\\)\n\u201cInevitably, if today there is life on earth, then either\nthis is the last day (of life on earth), or the last day will\ncome.\u201d \n\n\\(p_2{:}\\)\n\u201cAt any possible day on which there is life on earth, it\nis possible that there will be life on earth the following\nday.\u201d \n\n\nHirokazu Nishimura (1979) has argued that if time is assumed to be\ndiscrete, then an Ockhamist cannot consistently accept the conjunction\nof \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\), whereas a Leibnizian can maintain such a view\nwithout contradicting himself. The purpose of the following figure is\nto clarify the difference between these two views.\n\n\n\n\nAs indicated in the above figure, an infinite number of ovals named\ni\\(_1\\), i\\(_2\\), i\\(_3\\), i\\(_4,\\ldots\\) represent a series of\ninstants i.e., equivalence classes of co-temporaneous moments, as\nmentioned in section 3. The cronicles are named c\\(_1\\), c\\(_2\\),\nc\\(_3\\), c\\(_4,\\ldots\\). For \\(n\\in \\{1,2,3,4,\\ldots \\}\\) the moment\ncorresponding to i\\(_n\\) on c\\(_n\\) will be the last day of life on\nearth. The totality of this infinity of chronicles represents the\nacceptance of \\(p_1\\). At the last day on each of these chronicles,\nc\\(_j\\), it would in fact be possible that life on earth could have\ncontinued yet another day. This is evident because of the existence in\nthe model of c\\(_{j+1}\\). Taken together this means that the statement\n\\(p_2\\) holds at any possible day in the model. This is what a\nLeibnizian would say. However, an Ockhamist would say, that given this\nmodel it would be possible to construct a chronicle c\\(_*\\), as shown\non the above figure for which the last day of life on earth would\nnever come. According to the Leibnizian, this construction of c\\(_*\\)\nmay not be permitted at all, since c\\(_*\\) may in fact be a maximal\nlinear subset which does not belong to C.\n\nThe point is that in the Ockhamist semantics, any maximal linear\nsubset of TIME is accepted as a chronicle. In the Leibnizian\nsemantics, the set of chronicles is an independent parameter. In a\nLeibnizian model, any subset of the set of all maximal linear subsets\ncould be accepted as the set of chronicles, C, as long as all moments\nin TIME belong to at least one chronicle.\n\nBelnap et al. have argued that it is implausible to assume\nthat there could be some property which could \u201cjustify treating\nsome maximal chains as real possibilities and others as not\u201d\n(Belnap et al. 2001, p. 205). On the other hand,\nNishimura\u2019s example is in fact a rather remarkable argument\nsuggesting that not all maximal chains have to be accepted as\nchronicles in the semantics for future contingents. The example also\nspeaks in favor of the view that the Leibnizian theory is more\nplausible than Prior\u2019s Ockhamistic theory, see\n(\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle 1995, p. 268).\n\nThe Leibnizian and Prior\u2019s Ockhamistic views seem to be very\nsimilar, and most differences between them seem to be nuances of\nmetaphysical interpretation. In fact, the Leibnizian way of\nintroducing truth-values for future contingents seems somewhat tricky.\nIt should also be mentioned that if the idea of chronicles as\n\u2018parallel lines\u2019 is taken seriously, then there is no\nproper branching in the Leibnizian model. For this reason, it can be\nargued that this model is incompatible with objective indeterminism,\nsince the alternative lines should not be counted as proper\npossibilities, see e.g. (MacFarlane 2003, p. 325). On the other hand,\nit may be argued that all the conceivable chronicles in the Leibnizian\nmodel represent logical possibilities. Obviously, only some of them\nare chosen, but from a logical point of view any of them could in\nprinciple have been chosen. Still, it may be objected that the\nLeibnizian model is rather sophisticated and speculative, and that it\nmay be more attractive to look for other ways of defining \u201ctruth\nat a moment of time\u201d.\n5.3 The True Futurist Theory: The Thin Red Line\n\nThe medieval assumption of the true future can in terms of modern\nlogic and a branching time model be rendered as meaning that there is\na privileged branch (i.e., a specific chronicle) in the model. If\n\\(b\\) is this privileged branch, then the truth-value of a\nproposition, \\(p\\), at a moment of time, \\(t\\), may be defined in\nterms of the Ockhamistic valuation function as \\(\\Ock(t,b,p)\\). We may\nspeak of \u201cthe actual future\u201d (Lucas 1989). This solution\nhas been studied in (\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 1981) and further\nelaborated and discussed in (Malpass et al. 2012) and (Borghini et al.\n2013). Consider, for instance, the following model, in which the\narrows indicate the true future at any moment.\n\n\n\n\nIn this model, \\(F(x)q\\) is true at \\(t_2\\) and \\(F(x+y)q\\) is true at\n\\(t_1\\), although none of the propositions are necessary, since\n\\(F(x){\\sim}q\\) is possible at \\(t_2\\). The reason why \\(F(x)q\\) is\ntrue at \\(t_2\\) is just that the evaluation of a proposition according\nto the true futurist theory should be based on the specified branch\nthrough \\(t_2\\) representing \u201cthe future\u201d at \\(t_2\\)\nwithin the model. However, as we shall see in the following, it turns\nout that the idea of a specified branch at every moment can be\nintegrated into the semantics in several ways. But first of all some\ncomments on the very idea of a specified branch.\n\nWhat makes the specified branch privileged? Is it just that it\nrepresents what is going to happen? Is there anything in the present\nsituation, \\(t_2\\), which makes one branch ontologically special as\nopposed to the other branches? It might be tempting to refer to some\nsort of a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d status of the privileged branch,\nsince we have no way of knowing which branch is the specified one\nrepresenting \u201cthe future\u201d except by waiting.\n\nSome authors have held that the idea of a privileged branch is\nincompatible with indeterminism. Hence Rich Thomason (1970, 1984) has\nargued that from an indeterministic point of view no special branch\ndeserves to be called the true future. Of course, the problem is what\nexactly the idea of indeterminism implies. According to MacFarlane, it\nis problematic to give one future branch a special status, if we want\nto hang on to objective indeterminism regarding the future (MacFarlane\n2003, p. 325). On the other hand, although the true futurist theory\ndoes contain some intricate notions, it has not been shown to be\ninconsistent, and a supporter of the theory may still hold that the\ntheory correctly explains what reality is like. It should be borne in\nmind that true futurist theory was introduced exactly to avoid what\nmany have held to be counter-intuitive tenets, e.g. that all future\ncontingents are false now (the Peircean view), or that they have no\nchronicle-independent truth-values now (the Ockhamistic view).\nTherefore, it should be carefully considered which approach ultimately\nleads to the fewest problems.\n\nAccording to Belnap and Green a true futurist theory should include\nthe idea that at any moment of time \u2013 including any\ncounterfactual moment \u2013 there is a true future, a so-called\n\u201cthin red line\u201d (Belnap and Green 1994), passing through\nthat moment. Formally, this means that there must be a function,\n\\(\\TRL\\), which gives the true future for any moment of time, \\(t\\).\nMore precisely, \\(\\TRL(t)\\) yields the linear past as well as the true\nfuture of \\(t\\), extended to a maximal\n set.[5]\n\nIn fact, the idea of adding a function like \\(\\TRL\\) to the semantical\nmodel had earlier been suggested by (McKim and Davis 1976) and by\n(Thomason and Gupta 1980). But unlike Belnap and Green these authors\ndid not name the function in any spectacular way.\n\nIt would of course be fatal for the true futurist theory if it could\nbe demonstrated that it contradicts assumptions which we for other\nreasons should accept. Belnap and Green (1994) have argued that there\nare in fact such fundamental problems related to the true futurist\npicture. They have argued that it is not sufficient for the model to\nspecify a preferred branch corresponding to the true history (past,\npresent, and future): it must be assumed that there is a preferred\nbranch at every counterfactual moment. They have illustrated\ntheir view using the following statement:\n\n\u201cThe coin will come up heads. It is possible, though that it\nwill come up tails, and then later it will come up tails again (though\nat this moment it could come up heads), and then, inevitably, still\nlater it will come up tails yet again.\u201d (Belnap and Green 1994,\np. 379)\n\n\nThis statement may be represented in terms of tense logic with\n\\(\\tau\\) representing tails and \\(\\eta\\) heads, respectively:\n\n\\[\nF(1)\\eta \\wedge \\Diamond F(1)(\\tau \\wedge \\Diamond F(1)\\eta \\wedge F(1)(\\tau \\wedge \\Box F(1)\\tau))\n\\]\n\n\nand in terms of the following branching time structure:\n\n\n\n\nThe example shows that if we want to take this kind of everyday\nreasoning into account, we need to be able to speak not only about the\nfuture, but also about what would be the future at any counterfactual\nmoment. As mentioned above this is formally done in terms of the\nTRL-function. But what are the constraints on this function? Belnap\nand Green have argued that:\n\n(TRL1)\n\\(t \\in \\TRL(t)\\)\n\n\nshould hold in general. Moreover, they have also maintained that:\n\n(TRL2)\n\\(t_1 \\lt t_2 \\supset \\TRL(t_1) = \\TRL(t_2)\\)\n\n\nshould hold for the TRL-function. On the other hand, they have argued\nthat the combination of (TRL1) and (TRL2) is inconsistent with the\nvery idea of branching time. The reason is that if (TRL1) and (TRL2)\nare both accepted, it follows from \\(t_1 \\lt t_2\\) that \\(t_2 \\in\n\\TRL(t_1)\\) i.e., that all moments of time after \\(t_1\\) would have to\nbelong to the thin red line through \\(t_1\\), which means that there\nwill in fact be no branching at all. However, it is very hard to see\nwhy a true futurist would have to accept (TRL2), which seems to be too\nstrong a requirement. Rather than (TRL2), the weaker condition\n(TRL2\u2032) can be employed:\n\n(TRL2\u2032)\n\\((t_1 \\lt t_2 \\wedge t_2 \\in \\TRL(t_1)) \\supset \\TRL(t_1) =\n\\TRL(t_2)\\)\n\n\nThis seems to be much more natural in relation to the notion of a true\nfuturist branching time logic. Belnap has later accepted that\n(TRL2\u2032) is a plausible alternative to (TRL2) (see Belnap et al.\n2001, p. 169).\n\n(TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032) are essential in a branching time structure\nwith a TRL-function. This may be illustrated using a discrete\ntense-logic like the one mentioned in section 2. We shall assume that\nthere are two functions, \\(\\next\\) and \\(back\\), from TIME to TIME\nsuch that \\(\\next(t)\\) is the moment just after \\(t\\) on \\(\\TRL(t)\\),\nand \\(back(t)\\) is the moment just before \\(t\\) on \\(\\TRL(t)\\). The\nsimilarity to the \u201ctomorrow\u201d \\(T(p)\\) and\n\u201cyesterday\u201d \\(Y(p)\\) of section 2 \u2013 and hence, to\nPrior\u2019s considerations in (Prior 1967) \u2013 is worth noting,\neven though the functions ranged over propositions rather than times.\nStarting from an arbitrary moment \\(t_0\\) we may define \\(t_n =\n\\next^n(t_0)\\) for \\(n = 1,2,3,\\ldots.\\) It follows from (TRL1) and\n(TRL2\u2032) that \\(\\TRL(t_0) = \\TRL(t_1) = \\TRL(t_2) =\\TRL(t_3) =\n\\ldots\\) and that \\(t_n \\in \\TRL(t_0)\\) for any \\(n\\). In other words,\nwe might have started from the functions \\(\\next\\) and \\(\\back\\) in\norder to define the function, \\(\\TRL\\). Taking \\(t_0\\) as now the\nfunction \\(\\next\\) would by iterative use constitute the elements of\nthe future part of \\(\\TRL(t_0)\\). Similarly, the past part of\n\\(\\TRL(t_0)\\), i.e., PAST\\((t_0)\\) could be established by iterative\nuse of \\(back\\), given that the branching time structure is backwards\nlinear (as mentioned in section 3). In consequence, it turns out that\nthere is a nice correspondence between a discrete branching time\nsystem defined in terms of \\(\\TRL\\) and \\(\\lt\\) on the one hand, and\non the other hand the same system defined in terms of the functions,\n\\(\\next\\) and \\(\\back\\). In this way, a study of the discrete case\nleads to an interesting illustration of the idea of the thin red line\nas well as to an emphasis of the importance of (TRL1) and\n(TRL2\u2032).\n\nIn general, we can inductively define a chronicle-independent\nvaluation function, using TRUE, which as mentioned in section\n4.2 gives a truth-value (0 or 1) for any propositional constant at any\nmoment in TIME, and using the TRL-function. On this basis, the\nvaluation function, \\(T(t,p)\\) can be defined recursively for any wff\n\\(p\\), and any moment of time \\(t\\):\n\n\n(a)\n\\(T(t, p) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\TRUE(p,t) = 1\\), where \\(p\\) is any propositional\nconstant. \n\n(b)\n\\(T(t, p\\wedge q) = 1\\)\niff\nboth \\(T(t,p) = 1\\) and \\(T(t,q) = 1\\) \n\n(c)\n\\(T(t,{\\sim}p) = 1\\)\niff\nnot \\(T(t,p) = 1\\) \n\n(d)\n\\(T(t,Pq) = 1\\)\niff\nthere is some \\(t'\\) with \\(t'\\lt t\\) and \\(T(t',q) = 1\\)\n\n\n(e)\n\\(T(t,Fq) = 1\\)\niff\nthere is some \\(t' \\in \\TRL(t)\\) with \\(t\\lt t'\\) and \\(T(t',q)\n= 1\\) \n\n\n\\(T(t,q) = 1\\) can be read \u2018\\(q\\) is true at \\(t\\)\u2019. As in\nsection 4.2 the valuation function has the range \\(\\{0,1\\}\\). A\nformula \\(q\\) is said to be T-valid if and only if \\(T(t,q) = 1\\) for\nany \\(t\\) in any branching time structure (TIME,\\(\\le\\),C), any\nvaluation function TRUE, and any TRL-function defined on\nTIME.\n\nThis means that sentences only involving tenses are what Belnap (in\nhonor of Carnap) has called \u201cmoment-determinate\u201d (Belnap\n1991, p. 163), indicating that their truth-value doesn\\('\\)t vary with\nthe chronicle. The advantage of this view is that it corresponds with\neveryday reasoning and natural language understanding as it is most\ncommonly conceived.\n\nAs in sections 4.2 and 5.1, it is possible to extend the language in\norder to take metrical notions into consideration:\n\n\n\\(T(t,P(x)q) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\exists t'{:} \\dur(t',t,x) \\amp T(t',q) = 1\\) \n\n\\(T(t,F(x)q) = 1\\)\niff\n\\(\\exists t'{:} \\dur(t,t',x) \\amp t' \\in \\TRL(t) \\amp T(t',q) =\n1\\) \n\n\nBelnap and Green have argued that the constraints on the TRL-function\nshould give rise to a logic in which the following theorems hold:\n\n(T1)\n\\(PPq \\supset Pq\\)\n(T2)\n\\(FFq \\supset Fq\\)\n(T3)\n\\(q \\supset PFq\\)\n\n\nIf we accept the constraints (TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032), and use the\nabove recursive definition of the valuation function \\(T(t,p)\\), we\nobtain a semantics according to which (T1) and (T2) are valid.\n\nHowever, with the semantics presented above, (T3) will not be valid.\nTo see why this is the case, consider a situation with a moment of\ntime \\(t_1\\) such that \\(t_1 \\not\\in \\TRL(t_0)\\) for any \\(t_0\\lt\nt_1\\). Assume that \\(t_1\\) is the only moment at which \\(q\\) is true.\nThen \\(PFq\\), hence also \\(q \\supset PFq\\), will be false at\n\\(t_1\\).\n\nEven the formula\n\n(T3\u2032)\n\\(q \\supset P(x)F(x)q\\)\n\n\nis false when evaluated with semantics of this kind.\n\nThe rejection of (T3\u2032) can be illustrated by the following\ndiagram, in which the arrow on the upper branch indicates the thin red\nline. (The vertical line in this diagram represents a set of\nco-temporaneous moments, i.e., what is sometimes called an\ninstant.)\n\n\n\n\nAccording to this diagram \\(q\\) holds at the counterfactual moment of\ntime, \\(t\\). However, as indicated in the diagram \\(F(x)q\\) was false\n\\(x\\) time units earlier than \\(t\\), since at that time \\(t'\\) would\nbe the true future \\(x\\) time units later.\n\nThe rejection of (T3) and (T3\u2032) is not the only problem related\nto a TRL-semantics defined in this way. It should also be pointed out\nthat it is somewhat complicated to state the semantics of modal\nexpressions if we follow this procedure, since it may involve the\nquantification over possible TRL-functions. This approach has been\nfurther investigated in (Bra\u00fcner et al. 1998).\n\nThere is, however, a simpler strategy which makes it possible to\nensure the validity of (T3) and (T3\u2032) even if one wants to\ninsist on the assumption of the thin red line. This can be done by\ndefining \u201ctrue at time \\(t\\)\u201d in terms of \u201ctrue at\ntime \\(t\\) and chronicle \\(c\\)\u201d, as it is defined in the\nOckhamist semantics: \n\n\\[\nT(t,p) = \\Ock(t, \\TRL(t),p)\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(p\\) is an arbitrary propositional expression. \\(T(t,p) = 1\\)\ncan be read \u201c\\(p\\) is true at \\(t\\)\u201d. This idea of\nobtaining a thin red line semantics by introducing a unique historical\nparameter has been discussed in (MacFarlane 2003, 330\u2013331, cf.\nn. 10).\n\nAs in Prior\u2019s Ockhamistic model it is straightforward to\nintroduce metrical tense operators in this system.\n\nAs in the Leibniz-theory we should not necessarily assume that all\nmaximal linear subsets in the branching time structure should be taken\ninto account as chronicles in the semantics. It may be reasonable to\nassume various restrictions regarding the set of chronicles and its\nuse in the semantical model. In fact, it has turned out to be\ninteresting to consider the possibilities of modifying the definition\nof \\(C(t)\\) used in (f) of the \\(Ock\\) definition in section 5.1.\n\nThe following validity definition may be suggested:\n\n(V)\nA formula \\(p\\) is said to be TRL-valid if and only if\n\\(\\Ock(t,\\TRL(t),p) = 1\\) for any \\(t\\) in any branching time\nstructure, (TIME,\\(\\le\\),C), any valuation function TRUE, any\ndefinition of \\(C(t)\\) with \\(\\TRL(t) \\in C(t)\\) and \\(C(t) \\subseteq\n\\{c \\in C\\mid t \\in c\\}\\) for all \\(t\\), and any TRL-function for which\n(TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032) hold.\n\n\nGiven this definition it is easily seen that (T1\u20133) and\n(T3\u2032) are all TRL-valid. Regarding the interplay between the\ntense operators and the modal operator, it is straightforward to\nverify that the following is TRL-valid:\n\n(T4)\n\\(F(x)p \\supset \\Diamond F(x)p\\)\n\n\nwhereas (P3) in section 2 will not be TRL-valid for propositions\ndepending on the future. However, the notion of validity suggested\nabove may also allow for the following definition of \\(C(t)\\), which\nhas been discussed in (Bra\u00fcner et al. 2000):\n\n\\(C(t) = \\{c \\mid t \\in c \\amp \\TRL(t')=c\\), for all \\(t' \\in c\\) with\n\\(t \\lt t'\\}\\) \n\nNote that with this definition (TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032) together say\nexactly that \\(\\TRL(t) \\in C(t)\\). Also note that \\(C(t)\\) may contain\nmore branches than just \\(\\TRL(t)\\).\n\nHowever, it should be mentioned that the possibility operator in this\nmodel is somewhat surprising. In the obvious metrical extension of the\nsystem the following formula is invalidated:\n\n(T5)\n\\(F(x)\\Diamond F(y)p \\supset \\Diamond F(x)F(y)p\\)\n\n\nAccording to the usual Ockhamist semantics (T5) is valid. The\nrejection of (T5) in the system presented in (Bra\u00fcner et al.\n2000) may be illustrated with reference to the following model:\n\n\n\n\nHere it is assumed that \\(\\TRL(t)=c_2\\) for all \\(t\\) on \\(c_2\\) after\n\\(t_2\\) and that \\(\\TRL(t)=c_3\\) for all \\(t\\) on \\(c_3\\) after\n\\(t_2\\). Clearly, this means that \\(C(t_2)=\\{c_2,c_3\\}\\). In\nconsequence, the proposition \\(\\Diamond F(y)p\\) holds at \\(t_2\\). This\nmeans that \\(F(x)\\Diamond F(y)p\\) is true at\n\\(t_1\\). However, the proposition \\(\\Diamond F(x)F(y)p\\) is false at\n\\(t_1\\), since \\(c_2\\) is not included in \\(C(t_1)\\). According to the\ndefinition, \\(C(t_1)\\) should include exactly the chronicles which\npass through \\(t_1\\) and which immediately after \\(t_1\\) are specified\nby the TRL-function. This means that \\(C(t_1)=\\{c_1,c_3\\}\\), and then\n(T5) turns out to be false at \\(t_1\\).\n\nThis rejection of (T5) amounts to the following idea: a chronicle may\nnot be available as a possibility now, although it may later become\navailable. That is, new possibilities may show up.\n\nThis example illustrates that true futurist logics satisfying\nrequirements which correspond to Belnap\u2019s and Green\u2019s\nsemantical criteria may differ significantly from Prior\u2019s\nOckhamism. Even if we assume that (T1\u20134) should be valid and\nthat (TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032) should hold, we cannot be sure that (T5)\nis valid. On the other hand, some might of course intuitively find\n(T5) just as plausible as (T1\u20134), for which reason they would\ninsist on a definition of \\(C(t)\\) according to which (T5) is valid.\nThis, of course, means that the validity notion in (V) should be\nmodified introducing further restrictions on the acceptable\ndefinitions of \\(C(t)\\). In order to ensure the validity of (T5) one\nmight require that \\(C(t') \\subseteq C(t)\\) for all \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\)\nwith \\(t \\lt t'\\). Another possibility is of course to insist on the\nOckhamistic definition of \\(C(t)\\), i.e., \\(C(t) = \\{c \\mid t \\in c\\}\\),\nin which case TRL-validity would give the same result as\nOckham-validity.\n\nIt is still an open question which definition of TRL-validity we\nshould prefer, if we want it to include a semantical definition of\nwhat it means for a future contingent to be true, and if we want it to\nensure the validity of (T3) and (T3\u2032). In addition to the two\nsolutions mentioned above, we may consider a use of a TRL-function\nthat appears to bring us very close to Molina\u2019s notion of middle\nknowledge mentioned in section 1 (see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2014).\nThe idea is to let the evaluation of the truth-value of a proposition\ndepend on two moments, \\(s\\) and \\(t\\), instead of just one (see\nMacFarlane 2003; MacFarlane 2014; De Florio and Frigerio 2020). We may\nspeak of the truth-value of a proposition at the moment \\(t\\) from the\nperspective of moment \\(s\\). Whereas \\(t\\) is the moment of\nevaluation, \\(s\\) is the \u201ccontext of utterance\u201d or at\nleast a moment at which the statement in question is imagined to be\nconsidered.\n\nGiven the TRL-function, \\(\\TRL\\), and a moment \\(s\\), we introduce an\nadjusted thin red line function, \\(\\TRL_s\\), by defining that\n\\(\\TRL_s\\) and \\(TRL\\) differ only for moments that belong to the past\nof \\(s\\), in which case \\(\\TRL_s\\) gives the chronicle \\(TRL(s)\\). In\nother words, \\(\\TRL_s(t) = \\TRL(s)\\) for \\(t \\lt s\\), and otherwise\n\\(\\TRL_s(t) = \\TRL(t)\\). Intuitively, using \\(\\TRL_s\\) means that\n\\(s\\) is conceived as the perspective of the statement in question,\nand it is actual in the sense that at any moment before it would\nbelong to the true future according to the evaluation currently used.\nIt is easy to verify that \\(\\TRL_s\\), like \\(TRL\\), satisfy the\nconstraints (TRL1) and (TRL2\u2032). This means that \\(\\TRL_s\\)\nformally qualifies as a thin red line function for an arbitrary\nmoment, \\(s\\), in the same sense as \\(\\TRL\\).\n\nWe may illustrate the idea using discrete time. Assuming that every\nchronicle in TIME is isomorphic with the set of integers, there will\nfor each chronicle be a function, \\(back\\), from TIME to TIME such\nthat \\(back(t)\\) is the moment on the chronicle that is just before\nthe moment \\(t\\). Furthermore, there is a function \\(\\next_s\\) such\nthat \\(\\next_s(t)\\) is the moment following immediately after \\(t\\) on\n\\(\\TRL_s(t)\\).\n\nIt should be noted that it follows from (TRL1\u20132) that\n\\(\\TRL_s(t) = \\TRL_s(\\next_s(t)) = \\TRL_s(\\next_{s}^2(t)) = \\ldots\\)\nand in general that \\(\\next_{s}^n(t) \\in \\TRL_s(t)\\) for any natural\nnumber \\(n\\). In addition, it should be mentioned that since the\nbranching-time system is backwards linear, there is no need to specify\nthe chronicle in \\(back(t)\\).\n\nAssuming that there is a basic assignment function giving a\ntruth-value for each propositional letter at each instant, we may then\nintroduce the following recursive definition of the truth-value of a\ntense-logical proposition at the moment \\(t\\) seen from the\nperspective of the moment, \\(s\\):\n\n\n\\(T(t,s,p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(p\\) is a propositional letter assigned with the truth-value 1\nat the moment \\(t\\). \n\n\\(T(t,s,P(n)p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(T(\\back^n(t),s,p)=1\\) \n\n\\(T(t,s,F(n)p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(T(\\next_{s}^n(t),s,p)=1\\) \n\n\\(T(t,s,\\Diamond p)=1\\)\niff\n\\(\\exists t': t\\lt t' \\amp T(t,t',p)=1\\) \n\n\nNegation and the propositional connectives are treated in the\ntraditional manner. The necessity operator, \\(\\Box\\), is defined as\n\\(\\sim \\Diamond \\sim\\).\n\nA tense-logical proposition, \\(p\\), is said to be valid in general iff\nfor any branching-time system with a valuation function, \\(T\\),\ndefined in this manner it holds that \\(T(t,t,p)=1\\) at any instant\n\\(t\\) in the branching-time system.\n\nIf we identify t and s in this way, it is obvious that we obtain:\n\n(O1)\n\\(\\next_{t}^n(\\back^n(t))=t\\)\n(O2)\n\\(\\back^n(\\next_{t}^n (t))=t\\)\n\n\nIt follows from (O1\u20132) that \\(P(n)F(n)p \\equiv p\\) and\n\\(F(n)P(n)p \\equiv p\\) are valid theses in the semantics. Furthermore,\nit is easily verified that (T3\u2032), (T4), and (T5) are valid as\nwell in the system. It is also obvious that \\(P(n)F(n+m)p \\supset \\Box\nP(n)F(n+m)p\\) is not valid in general according to this semantics. In\nconsequence, the crucial principle (P3) should be rejected on this\nview. It seems that the semantics sketched here will have all the\nproperties, which one would expect in Ockhamistic (and Molinistic)\nsemantics (see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2014; \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and\nJakobsen 2018; De Florio and Frigerio 2019).\n5.4 The Supervaluationist Theory\n\nSome logicians have argued that the notion of true future is\nunacceptable on philosophical grounds or that it is at least\nunnecessary, since it is possible to establish a semantic model\naccepting (P5) but rejecting (P3) without involving any idea of a true\nfuture. Richmond H. Thomason (1970, 1981, 1984) has formulated a\ntheory based on so-called supervaluations. According to this theory a\nproposition \\(p\\) is true at a moment \\(t\\) if and only if it is true\nat \\(t\\) for every chronicle \\(c\\) passing through \\(t\\), and a\nproposition \\(p\\) is false if and only if it is false for every\nchronicle \\(c\\) passing through \\(t\\). Formally speaking, we may again\nuse the Ock-function to recursively define truth at a moment \\(t\\) and\na chronicle \\(c\\). Then we may define truth at a moment of time by\nsupervaluating. This means that \\(p\\) is true at \\(t\\) if and only if\n\\(\\Ock(t,c,p) = 1\\) for all \\(c\\) with \\(t \\in c\\). Future contingent\npropositions will not meet that condition, nor will their negations,\nso they are considered neither true nor false. They are\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d in the sense that they lack\ntruth-values.\n\nThis theory allows the supervaluationist to reject (P3) and to accept\nfuture excluded middle, (P5), without accepting the idea of \u2018the\nthin red line\u2019 or \u201cthe true future\u201d. It should be\npointed out, however, that although this theory implies a rejection of\n(P3), it does in fact accept a related inference principle i.e., if\n\\(P(x)p\\) is true at a certain moment of time, \\(t\\), then \\(\\Box\nP(x)p\\) will also be true at \\(t\\).\n\nThomason has shown that the supervaluation theory can in fact meet\nsome of the basic challenges related to the future contingents. He has\nalso shown that the theory can be extended in such a way that it may\nalso incorporate deontic logic i.e., the logic of moral obligation\n(Thomason 1981, pp. 165 ff.). A crucial question for this approach is,\nhowever, whether the idea of truth-value gaps for future contingents\nis philosophically acceptable. In other words, is it acceptable that\nsome well-formed propositions simply lack truth-values?\n\nA distinctive feature of Thomason\u2019s theory is that the usual\ntruth-functional technique breaks down. For instance, if \\(F(1)p\\) is\na future contingent, then \\(F(1)p\\) and \\(F(1){\\sim}p\\) are both\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d, but the conjunction \\(F(1)p\n\\wedge F(1){\\sim}p\\) will be false and the\ndisjunction \\(F(1)p \\vee F(1){\\sim}p\\) will be\ntrue. It may be objected that it seems odd that a disjunction could be\ntrue when neither of the disjuncts is true, and a conjunction false\nwhen neither of the conjuncts is false.\n5.5 Relativist Theory\n\nRecently John MacFarlane (2003, 2008) has suggested a new approach to\nthe problem of future contingents. Like Nuel Belnap et al.\n(2001), MacFarlane challenges the classical notion that the\ntruth-value of a statement or proposition should be determined solely\nwith respect to the context (including the moment) of utterance. He\nalso agrees with Belnap and Green in rejecting the idea of the true\nfuture (i.e., the thin red line). But unlike Belnap, MacFarlane does\nnot want to give up all talk of truth in a context. In this way\nMacFarlane accepts the same definition as Belnap, Green and Thomason\nof \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)\\), where \\(t\\) is a moment of time and \\(c\\) is a\nhistory (or a chronicle), but differs on \u201ctruth at a\nmoment\u201d or \u201ctruth at a context\u201d.\n\nAccording to MacFarlane\u2019s theory the truth of a statement should\nbe relativised to both a context of utterance and a context of\nassessment. The context of utterance is the context in which the\nspeech act is made. The context of assessment is the context in which\nwe assess the speech act. According to the theory, a statement \\(S\\)\nis true as used in the context \\(C\\) and assessed in the context\n\\(C'\\), if and only if \\(S\\) is true at \\(m\\) for every chronicle\n\\(c\\) passing through \\(m\\) and \\(m'\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(m'\\) are\nmoments within the contexts \\(C\\) and \\(C'\\) with \\(m \\le m'\\). This\nmeans that a statement like \u201cit will be sunny tomorrow\u201d is\ntrue as uttered yesterday and assessed from today, given that it is in\nfact sunny today. But it will not be true assessed from yesterday,\ngiven that it was not settled yesterday that today would be sunny.\n\nIt turns out that MacFarlane\u2019s theory implies an acceptance of\nthe principle of future excluded middle, (P5), and a rejection of the\nprinciple of the necessity of the past, (P3). An advocate of the\ntheory (i.e., a relativist) will clearly also agree with\nsupervaluationism in allowing for truth-value gaps. However, in\naddition a relativist will accept the view that future contingents can\nbe true as assessed from a future context. For criticism of\nMacFarlane\u2019s position see Heck 2006.\n6. Conclusion\n\nAs we have seen, Lavenham\u2019s medieval attempt at systematising\nthe various possible responses to the problem of future contingents\ngives rise to a classification. This classification is based on the\nobservation that in order to reject the logical argument for\ndeterminism we have to reject at least one of the principles, (P3)\n(necessity of the past) and (P5) (the principle of future excluded\nmiddle). It is also clear from Lavenham\u2019s analysis that he\nwanted to focus on the question whether future contingents have\ndeterminate truth-values. When formulated in terms of the modern\ndebate, the question is whether future contingents have\nbranch-independent truth-values. Or using Belnap\u2019s vocabulary:\nIs there settled truth about future contingents? Using the reactions\non the classical argument mentioned in section 2 and the views on\ntruth-values of future contingents as two classification principles,\nwe may group the solutions considered in the following diagram:\n\n\n\u00a0\nSome future contingents are neither true nor false\nAll future contingents are either true or\nfalse\n\nRejection of the principle of the necessity of the past\n(P3)\n Priorean Ockhamism\n\n(Nuel Belnap)\n\n\nSupervaluationism\n\n(Richmond Thomason)\n\n\nRelativism\n\n(John MacFarlane) \n Leibnizianism\n\n(Davis Lewis, Alberto Zanardo)\n\n\nTrue Futurism\n\n(classical Ockhamism, Molinism)  \n\nRejection of the principle of future excluded middle\n(P5)\nThree valued logic\n\n(Jan \u0141ukasiewicz) \nPriorean Peirceanism\n\n(A.N. Prior) \n\n\nThe classification of Belnap\u2019s view in the above diagram is\nbased on the assumption that his \u201csettled true\u201d refers to\n\u201ctrue\u201d as it is used in the present context.\n\nRegarding the classification represented in the diagram it should be\nnoted that from a logical point of view the two rows are not mutually\nexclusive. However, although it would in principle be possible to\nreject both (P3) and (P5), we do not know any important theory of that\nkind.\n\nIt should also be noted that the theories in the first row all\nformally make use of the Ockhamist recursive semantics, although they\ndiffer in how or whether truth at a moment of time is defined in terms\nof \\(\\Ock(t,c,p)\\).\n\nAs we have seen, there are ongoing philosophical debates regarding\nfuture contingents. There is still a focus on the questions\nrepresented in the diagram, but other problems are also discussed. One\nproblem which has attracted much attention is the study of future\ncontingents as seen in relation to branching space-time and various\nideas within physics.
