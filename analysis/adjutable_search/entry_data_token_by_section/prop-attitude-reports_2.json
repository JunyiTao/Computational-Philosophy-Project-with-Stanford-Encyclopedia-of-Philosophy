    "main_text": "The Naive Russellian theory\n4. The Naive Russellian theory\n\nAnti-Fregeans draw their inspiration from\n Bertrand Russell.\n Russell proposed what we might call an acquaintance-based theory of\nthought, according to which some of our thoughts are directly about\nthe individuals they concern. We follow Kaplan 1977 in calling such\npropositions singular propositions. A proposition is singular\nwith respect to an object o just in case it is about\no in virtue of having o as a direct\nconstituent. It is general with respect to o, on the\nother hand, just in case it concerns o but only in\nvirtue of having a proxy of o that determines, either\nby satisfaction conditions or otherwise, o. Russell\nmaintained that there are logically proper names, which\ncontribute only their referents to the propositions expressed by\nsentences that contain them in subject position. He thus maintained\nthat sentences containing logically proper names express singular\npropositions.\n\nBut Russell was stingy in what he counted as a genuine logically\nproper name. For Russell, only \u2018this\u2019, as a name of a\nsense datum, and perhaps \u2018I\u2019, when Russell set aside his\nHumean doubts with one\u2019s acquaintance with a self, are genuine\nnames. Ordinary external world objects cannot be named and are known\nonly by description, according to Russell. This is because one can\nhave a genuine name only for that with which one is acquainted and one\nis acquainted only with that for which misidentification is not\nrationally open and the individual\u2019s existence is certain. So,\nif one is presented with an individual and it is possible to be\npresented with that individual again and not realize it is the same\nobject as before, then one is not acquainted with that individual;\none\u2019s thoughts about that individual are, in that case, all\nindirect. This line of reasoning relies on the Fregean claim that\ncases of identity confusion must be explained in terms of a difference\nin thought-constituents. This led Russell to agree with Frege\nregarding the truth-values of (1)-(4) and agree that (5) and (6)\nexpress different propositions. But Russell still insisted that such\nthought is ultimately grounded in acquaintance with individuals,\nalbeit not extra-mental individuals distinct from the self. Frege, on\nthe other hand, maintained that all thought was indirect, in the sense\nthat a thought is about an object o not in virtue of\nhaving o as a direct constituent but rather by having\na surrogate as a direct constituent that then determined\no, most plausibly in virtue of satisfaction\nconditions.\n\nLet\u2019s consider an example to better appreciate Russell\u2019s\nviews about our thoughts about external reality. Suppose that you are\nsitting before an object and say to yourself, \u201cThat apple is\ngreen.\u201d You are acquainted, Russell thinks, with the universal\nGREEN. But you are not acquainted with the apple itself, as\nmisidentification is possible. Your thought about the apple is\ntherefore by thought by description. But the description is not, for\nRussell, purely qualitative. Indeed, the description is\nindividual-involving. In virtue of your visual experience of the\napple, you are acquainted with a sense-datum caused by the apple. Call\nthis sense-datum BILL; Russell would use the demonstrative\n\u2018that\u2019, pointing inward at your occurrent sense-datum. The\ncontent of your thought about the apple, according to Russell, is then\nsomething like the following.\n\n<[the x: x causes BILL] x is green>\n\n\nThis proposition is general and thus indirect with respect to the\nexternal object (in this case, the apple), but singular and thus\ndirect with respect to the sense-datum being demonstratively referred\nto. For Russell, this is the canonical form all thought about external\nreality takes. Thought about concrete particulars is ultimately\ngrounded in acquaintance, albeit acquaintance with sense data, and\ndescriptive. (For a very intuitive presentation of this view, see\nchapter 5 of Russell 1912. For a more detailed presentation, see\nRussell 1910.)\n\nIt is clear that this is Russell\u2019s view for the contents of\nthought. It is less clear, however, that Russell was a descriptivist\nabout the semantics of ordinary proper names in public language.\nIndeed, there is good evidence that Russell thought that ordinary\npublic language names have as their sole semantic value their\nreferents and hence that simple sentences containing them express\nsingular propositions, but that most of us at least cannot entertain\nthose propositions and can only think about them under descriptions.\n(For a very nice defense of this asymmetric interpretation of Russell,\nsee Sainsbury 1993.)\n\nMore recent Russellians have, following Russell, maintained the\nobjects of our thought are, in many cases, singular propositions. But\nthey have broken from Russell in maintaining that extra-mental\nindividuals \u2013 like your apple \u2013 can also be constituents\nof the thoughts we grasp. Let\u2019s call such theorists\nneo-Russellians. (See Donnellan 1990 for a nice discussion of\nRussell\u2019s view in contrast with what we are here calling\nneo-Russellians.) Neo-Russellianism is a standard, although by no\nmeans universal, view in contemporary philosophy of language and mind.\nThere are important differences among neo-Russellians concerning what\nextra-mental objects can be thought of directly and, more importantly,\nwhich relations (perceptual, communicative, etc.) ground and are\nnecessary for direct thought. (For a discussion of this issue, see\nJeshion 2002, 2004 and the papers collected in Jeshion 2010. See also\nCrane 2011, 2013, especially chapter 6, Hawthorne and Manley 2012,\nMartin 2002, Recanti 2012, 2016. See also the supplementary document\non \n\nThe De Re/De Dicto Distinction\n\n\nfor further discussion.)\n\nAll neo-Russellians deny the Fregean idea that all cases of\nmisidentification are to be explained in terms of a difference in\nthought. Unlike Russell himself, neo-Russellians maintain that\nsingular thought is possible even for entities for which\nmisidentification is possible. The neo-Russellian cannot appeal to a\ndifference in thought contents to explain cases of rational\nmisidentification, as the distinctive claim of the neo-Russellian is\nthat the thought contents are the same precisely because the object\nmisidentified is the same and the object exhausts the thought content.\nNeo-Russellians thus need to develop a new explanation of\nFrege\u2019s puzzle.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two kinds of neo-Russellians. The first\n\u2013 what we will call Naive Russellians \u2013 insist\nthat the fundamental truth-conditions for belief attributions involve\nonly the objects and properties, not the way those items are\nrepresented. According to Naive Russellians, we are wrong to think\nthat (1) (i.e., \u2018Lois believes that Superman is strong\u2019)\nis true and (4) (i.e., \u2018Lois believes that Clark Kent is\nstrong\u2019) is false. They are composed in the same way from\nelements with the same semantic contents. Proponents of this view\ninclude Bealer 1982, \u00a739; Berg 1983; Braun 1998, 2000, 2001a,b;\nMcKay 1981, 1991; Nelson 2002, 2005; Reddam 1982; Richard 1983, 1987;\nSalmon 1986, 1989, 1995a; Soames 1987, 1989, 1995; and Tye 1978, for\nexample. (Bealer has changed his view; see his 1993. Richard has also\nchanged his view in 1989 and has subsequently become one of the most\neffective critics of Naive Russellianism. We discuss Richard\u2019s\nlater view below in\n Section 6.\n Tye seems to have abandoned Naive Russellianism. Soames has also\naltered his view, although much less drastically than the other three,\nin his 2002.) The other version of neo-Russellianism, to be discussed\nbelow in\n Section 6,\n agrees with the Fregean about the truth-values of (1) and (4) but\nrejects the Fregean claim that this difference requires a difference\nin thought content. While (1) is true and (4) is false, proponents of\nthis version of the view accept, that is not because they report\nattitudinal relations to different propositions; the proposition that\nSuperman is strong just is, as all neo-Russellians insist, the\nproposition that Clark Kent is strong.\n\nMany Naive Russellians (Bealer, Berg, McKay, Nelson, Reddam, Richard,\nSalmon, Soames, and Tye, for example) attempt to explain why people\nwrongly judge that (1) is true and (4) is false by appeal to the\ndifferent pragmatic implicatures utterances of those sentences\ntypically generate. Other Naive Russellians (Braun) do not. We shall\ndiscuss both versions of Naive Russellianism in what follows.\n\nIn communicating with one another, we have responsibilities that go\nbeyond just avoiding falsehood. For example, it is true but\ninappropriate to utter the sentence \u2018John is sober today\u2019\nif one knows that John is always sober. Uttering that sentence is\nmisleading because it suggests a contrast where there is none. But\nthat doesn\u2019t make it false. Someone who claims that the sentence\nis false is confounding pragmatics with semantics. What the sentence\nsays, as used on that occasion, is true, but uttering the sentence\npragmatically implicates something false: Namely, that John is at\nleast sometimes drunk. According to proponents of the first version of\nNaive Russellianism, confounding pragmatic responsibilities with our\nresponsibility to avoid falsehood can lead people astray concerning\nthe fundamental semantics of belief attribution. There are often\nresponsibilities for indicating the way in which the believer\nrepresents the individuals that her beliefs are about, but these go\nbeyond the truth-conditions of the attributions. Any additional\nresponsibilities are pragmatic, not semantic, requirements on the\nspeaker. They may be conditions that a speaker must ordinarily fulfill\nwhen making a belief attribution. But these conditions stem not from\nthe information semantically encoded by a given utterance of a\npropositional attitude reporting sentence but instead from the\ninformation pragmatically implicated by those utterances.\n\nThe Naive Russellian says that (4) is true (given that (1) is true and\n(1) and (4) say the same thing). But an utterance of (4) may\nnonetheless be very misleading and impart something false. Although\nLois believes that Clark Kent is strong, she would not accept the\nsentence \u2018Clark Kent is strong\u2019. According to the\npragmatic explanation of why people wrongly intuit that (4) is false,\nit is based on a confusion of semantics with pragmatics, as a typical\nutterance of (4) does pragmatically implicate something false. On this\nview, then, (4) is a true but misleading report of a belief Lois does\nindeed have. Let\u2019s call this the standard Naive Russellian\nview.\n\nWe can make this proposal more precise by articulating a metaphysics\nof belief encapsulated in John Perry\u2019s distinction between\nwhat an agent believes and how she believes it. (See\nPerry 1977 for an early presentation of the distinction, where he\ncharacterized the distinction as one between thoughts and\nsenses, and his 1979, where he characterized the distinction\nas one between belief contents and belief states,\n1980, 1990, 1997, and 1998 for a fuller presentation. It should be\nnoted that Perry himself is not a Naive Russellian, although he is a\nneo-Russellian. In his early papers, he simply left it undetermined\nwhether or not sentences like (4) and (1) say the same thing, although\nStalnaker claims that Perry claimed in personal communication that he\nintended his proposal to be equivalent to the Naive Russellian\nproposal; see note 11 of Stalnaker 1981. In later work, in particular\nhis 1989, co-authored with Crimmins, Perry explicitly says that (1)\nand (4) have different truth values. We discuss Crimmins and\nPerry\u2019s later view below in\n Section 6.)\n Perry argued against Frege\u2019s solution to Frege\u2019s puzzle\nby considering indexicals in propositional attitude reporting\nsentences. His attack is based upon the Fregean\u2019s identification\nof belief contents with belief states. Perry argued that we can\nadequately account for indexicals in attitudes only when we\ndistinguish these two aspect of acts of thinking and recognize that\nthey can vary independently. Perry claimed that what one believes is a\nfunction of the belief states and environment one is in. We can\nbelieve different contents in different environments by being in the\nsame belief state and we can believe the same content in different\nenvironments by being in the different belief states. So, for example,\nyou and I are in the same belief states when we utter \u2018I am\nhungry\u2019 and yet, because of differences in our environments\n\u2013 namely, because I am me and you are you \u2013 our belief\ncontents would be different. These differences in environment do not\nneed to be conceptualized by the agent to make a difference to her\ncognitive states. You can think what I think when I say to myself\n\u2018I am hungry\u2019 by pointing to me and saying to yourself\n\u2018He is hungry\u2019. In his 1977 Perry identified belief states\n(what he there called senses) with what he called\nroles and what Kaplan called character. In later\nwork (see in particular his 1980), Perry gives this identification up\nand individuates belief states in terms of their narrow functional\nrole.\n\nUtterances of belief reporting sentences pragmatically implicate\ninformation about how the agent believes what she believes \u2013\nthey pragmatically implicate information about the type of belief\nstate the agent is in \u2013 but semantically encode only information\nabout what is believed. An utterance of (4) will typically\npragmatically implicate false information about the type of belief\nstate by which Lois grasps (and takes a positive attitude towards) the\nsingular proposition concerning Clark Kent to the effect that he is\nstrong; namely, it implicates that that belief state is linked to the\nsentence \u2018Clark Kent is strong\u2019. An utterance of (1), on\nthe other hand, implicates the information that that belief state is\nlinked to the sentence \u2018Superman is strong\u2019. This\ndifference in implicating potential accounts for our intuitions that\n(1) and (4) convey different information. Those intuitions rightly\nrepresent the fact that there is a difference in the information an\nordinary hearer will take from a typical utterance of (4) as opposed\nto a typical utterance of (1), but they are wrongly taken to show that\n(1) and (4) themselves thus differ in truth-value.\n\nWhat can the Naive Russellian say about the two Fregean arguments\npresented in section 1? They can claim that the principle of\nrationality, according to which an agent is irrational just in case\nshe simultaneously believes a proposition and its negation, and the\nConverse Disquotation principle are false. Let\u2019s see how.\n\nPerry 1977 argues that once we accept the distinction between belief\nstates and belief contents, we should see that one can rationally\nbelieve a proposition and its negation by being in\n\u201cdistinct\u201d belief states. Lois simultaneously believes\nthat Superman is strong and that Superman is not strong. This does not\ncall her rationality into question, as she believes the first\nproposition by being in a belief state properly related to\n\u2018Superman is strong\u2019 and believes the second by being in a\nbelief state properly related to \u2018Clark Kent is not\nstrong\u2019. Irrationality is believing a proposition and its\nnegation in virtue of being in the same type of state, not merely\nbelieving a proposition and its negation.\n\nThese considerations lead the Naive Russellian to reject the following\nprinciple that the first Fregean argument above relies upon.\n\nRationality.\n\nAn agent is irrational if she believes a proposition and its negation\nat the same time.\n\n\nIn its place, the Naive Russellian proposes the following\nprinciple.\n\nRationality*.\n\nAn agent is irrational if she believes a proposition and its negation\nin the same way at the same time.\n\n\nIf Rationality is rejected and Rationality* adopted in its place, then\nthe truth of (2) (i.e., \u2018Lois believes that Clark Kent is not\nstrong\u2019) and (4) (i.e., \u2018Lois believes that Clark Kent is\nstrong\u2019) does not entail that Lois is irrational. The truth of\n(2) and (4) entails that Lois believes a proposition and its negation.\nGiven Rationality, this entails that Lois is irrational, which is\nuntenable, as Lois cannot correct her mistake through reflection\nalone. But the truth of (2) and (4) do not entail that the belief\nstates she is in in virtue of which Lois believes a proposition and\nits negation are the same type. Thus, given Rationality*, nothing\nabout Lois\u2019s irrationality follows from the truth of (2) and\n(4). Naive Russellianism is thus compatible with Lois\u2019s\nrationality.\n\nWhat about the second Fregean argument from above, which attempted to\nderive (3) (i.e., \u2018Lois does not believe that Clark Kent is\nstrong\u2019) and (4) from the assumption that (5) (i.e.,\n\u2018Superman is strong\u2019) and (6) (i.e., \u2018Clark Kent is\nstrong\u2019) express the same proposition and the fact that Lois\naccepts the one while rejecting the other? The Naive Russellian can\nclaim that we should similarly reject Converse Disquotation, according\nto which, roughly, an agent does not believe a proposition insofar as\nshe sincerely, reflectively, and competently withholds assent from a\nsentence that expresses that proposition, in favor of the following\nweaker principle.\n\nConverse Disquotation*\n\nIf an agent A sincerely, reflectively, and competently denies or\nwithholds acceptance from a sentence s (in a context\nc), then, where p is the proposition expressed by\ns in c, there is a way of believing p such\nthat, under that way of believing, A does not, at the time of\nc, take a positive attitude towards p.\n\n\nThe original Converse Disquotation principle licenses inferring that\none does not believe a given proposition from a single negative\ninstance. That is, if there is one way in which an agent is presented\nwith a proposition and rejects it, then the original Converse\nDisquotation principle allows us to infer that the agent does not\nbelieve that proposition and so that there is no way of grasping that\nproposition such that the agent affirms it. Given the Perry-inspired\nmetaphysics of belief, however, that is implausibly strong, as it is\nrather like inferring that Sally didn\u2019t walk to school from the\nfact that she didn\u2019t walk to school naked.\n\nIf Converse Disquotation is rejected and Converse Disquotation* is\nadopted in its place, then Lois\u2019s acceptance patterns do not\nentail the contradictory (3) and (4). Lois\u2019s acceptance of (5)\nand denial of (6) entail that Lois both believes and withholds\nbelief from one and the same proposition, where withholding\nbelief from a proposition involves grasping a proposition in a given\nway and taking a negative attitude towards it when so presented.\nWhereas simultaneously believing and not believing a single\nproposition is impossible, simultaneously believing and withholding\nbelief from a single proposition is not. (This intermediate state\nbetween believing and not believing was first uncovered in Kaplan\n1969. See also Salmon 1995a.)\n\nAs indicated above, Braun follows the standard Naive Russellian in\ninsisting that (1) and (4) say the same thing, but he departs from his\nfellow Naive Russellians by refusing to appeal to differences in the\npragmatic potential of (1) and (4) in accounting for our \u201cFrege\nintuitions.\u201d He doubts such appeals are successful because he\ndoubts that ordinary users of propositional attitude ascribing\nsentences have the necessary sophistication to impart information\nabout how an agent believes what she believes. (Saul, in her 1998,\n1999a,b, also doubts that the sort of information described above\nconcerning belief states or how an agent believes what she believes\ncould be pragmatically implicate, or indeed communicated in any way,\nby typical utterances of propositional attitude reporting sentences.\nShe does not, however, offer Braun\u2019s positive account.) He\nagrees that there is a difference in implicature-potential between the\nunembedded sentences (5) and (6) and he argues that this difference\nitself will account for our intuitions regarding the difference in\ntruth-value between typical utterances of (1) and (4). There is no\nneed, he argues, to go on and insist that typical utterances of (1)\nand (4) convey in any way information about how Lois believes what she\nbelieves. (See Braun 1998.) In subsequent papers Braun offers rich and\ninteresting accounts of the role propositional attitude ascribing\nsentences play in explaining, predicting, and rationalizing behavior.\n(See Braun 2000, 2001a,b.) \n",
