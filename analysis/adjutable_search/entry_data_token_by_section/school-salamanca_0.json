    "main_text": "The University of Salamanca\n1. The University of Salamanca\n\nIn order to understand the theoretical aspects of the School of\nSalamanca, it is necessary to give a short introduction to the history\nof the University of Salamanca. The focus will then turn mostly to two\nDominicans, Francisco de Vitoria and Domingo de Soto, and two Jesuits,\nLuis de Molina and Francisco Su\u00e1rez, though there were, of\ncourse, many other extremely important participants in the various\nfields of discourse in which the School engaged.\n\nThe University of Salamanca is the oldest institution of higher\neducation on the Iberian Peninsula. A cathedral school, located in\nSalamanca by 1130, received a charter from King Alfonso IX of\nLe\u00f3n in 1218 as a \u201cgeneral school\u201d for his realm.\nThe regulations for this school were promulgated by King Alfonso X\n\u201cel Sabio\u201d in 1254. Pope Alexander IV, in 1255, confirmed\nthe foundation of the studium generale and conferred on it\nthe licentia ubique docendi, a universally valid license to\nteach. Thereafter, Salamanca was recognized as a university. Courses\nin theology and law were offered, with many graduates receiving\nemployment by the Iberian kingdoms. Lectures on authoritative texts\nwere the most common means of teaching. Starting in the fifteenth\ncentury, professors also offered relectiones, treating in\ngreater depth a particular topic previously covered during lectures.\nDisputations were also held. Christopher Columbus made his case for a\nsea route to Asia to the university before his voyage in 1492.\n\nTwo notable learned men, Juan de Segovia and Alfonso Tostado de\nMadrigal, were affiliated with the University of Salamanca in the\nfifteenth century. A short account of their careers will highlight the\nrange of views that characterized Spanish theology at the university\nin those years. Juan, a professor of theology (1422\u20131435),\nparticipated in the Council of Basel (1431\u20131449), beginning in\n1432. He defended conciliar supremacy and supported the doctrine of\nMary\u2019s Immaculate Conception. His writings include polemics on\nbehalf of the council against Pope Eugenius IV (1431\u20131447) and a\nHistory of the General Council of Basel. Juan was made a\ncardinal by the antipope Felix V (1439\u20131449); but he retired\nafter Felix yielded to Eugenius\u2019s successor, Nicholas V\n(1447\u20131455). In retirement, Juan wrote on the need for dialogue\nwith Islam. Aware of his impending death (c. 1458), Juan bequeathed\nhis library to the university.\n\nAlfonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Madrigal, \u201cel Tostado\u201d, taught\ntheology before becoming a bishop in 1454. He, too, supported the\nCouncil of Basel, and he displayed his knowledge in extensive writings\non Scripture and ecclesiastical history. His tract on the polity\ndefended popular regimes in a realm whose intellectuals usually\nembraced monarchy. Alfonso also wrote against clerical concubinage.\nCertain controversial opinions of his were denounced to both pope and\ncouncil. The Castilian Dominican Juan de Torquemada wrote a critique\nof Alfonso\u2019s views, to which he replied. Alfonso later defended\nhis teachings in Rome before Pope Eugenius. \u201cEl Tostado\u201d,\non his death, left behind a reputation for great learning. (Torquemada\nalso set a precedent for ranking theological errors, most of them less\nthan heresy. The rankings given by the Spanish Scholastics set the\nstage for inquisitorial inquiries into lesser errors [Vega 2022:\n92]).\n\nThe Dominican order had established itself in Salamanca by 1244, when\na provincial chapter was held in that city. The convent of San\nEsteban, chosen as the site of a studium generale of the\norder in 1299, offered courses in grammar, logic and theology. During\nthe fourteenth century, the Dominican convent gained control of two of\nthe university\u2019s four chairs of theology. In 1489,\nSalamanca\u2019s Dominican studium received from the papacy\nthe right to award academic degrees. The building now associated with\nVitoria and his school was begun in 1524 but not finished until 1610,\nwhen the university was falling into decline. By that date, other\nIberian universities, especially Alcal\u00e1 and Coimbra, had become\ncompetitors of Salamanca for intellectual leadership. (Alcal\u00e0\nexcelled in the study of biblical texts [Bentley 1983].) In addition,\nthe Jesuits became competitors of the Dominicans as leading\nphilosophers and theologians. In Vitoria\u2019s century,\ndistinguished scholars at Salamanca included the jurist Mart\u00edn\nde Azpilcueta, who is known for developing a monetarist theory, and\nthe Scripture professor Gregorio Gallo, who considered the possibility\nthat the Apostle Thomas had preached in the New World. The role of the\nFranciscans in the same period, including their advocacy of the\ndoctrine of the Immaculate Conception, requires further research (Lynn\n2022; Izbicki 2022; Broggio 2002; all in Tubau ed. 2022).\n",
