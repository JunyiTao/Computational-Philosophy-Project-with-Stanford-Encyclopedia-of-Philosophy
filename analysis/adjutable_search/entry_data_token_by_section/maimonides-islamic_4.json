    "main_text": "God || On the Tension/Interplay of Immanence and Transcendence\n3.3 On the Tension/Interplay of Immanence and Transcendence\n\n\nAlongside his emphasis on God's utter unchanging and utterly\ntranscendent unity, Maimonides also describes God as the creator and\ncause of all existence, a notion which seems to bring Him into more\ndirect and immanent contact with the universe (as we have seen in\nAverroes\u2019 account in section 3.1 above). For thinkers like al-Farabi,\nAvicenna (and arguably, Maimonides) who emphasize a more robust sense\nof emanation than is found in Averroes and with it a more robust sense\nof God\u2019s transcendence, there arises a philosophical tension (or\nperhaps we might say interplay) between God-as-transcendent (as the\nemanating source of all being) and God-as-immanent (as the power\nmanifest in the workings of the universe). A tension/interplay can\nalso be seen more broadly as a feature of Islamic and Jewish\nNeoplatonized accounts (including both Avicenna\u2019s more transcendent\nand Averroes\u2019 less transcendent accounts) in which the more\ntranscendent Greek Plotinian idea of a divine source so unified that\nHe is at once above intellect as well as \u201cbeyond being\u201d is\nbrought together with the less transcendent Aristotelian notion of God\nwho is the pure being of perfected intellect.\n\n\nWe might also note that in the tension/interplay of divine immanence\nand transcendence in Maimonides\u2019 Guide, we might discern affinities\nfor each of the (competing) ideas of Avicenna and Averroes, the former\nemphasizing God\u2019s transcendence, and the latter identifying God as an\nimmanent first mover. Sometimes Maimonides\u2019 knowing God is emphasized\nmore immanently as \u201cthe form of the world\u201d (G 1.69, P\n166), and as the mover of the first sphere (G 1.72; G 2.1). Other\ntimes, Maimonides\u2019 knowing God is emphasized in His\ntranscendence\u2014as even more transcendent than the rest of the\nseparate cosmic intellects, with the reminder at Guide 2.4 that God is\nnot to be identified as mover of the first\nsphere.[13]\n\n\nCommenting on the dual description of God-as-immanent and\nGod-as-transcendent, Maimonides concludes at Guide 1.72,\n\nOn the one hand, there is a demonstration of His separateness, may He\nbe exalted, from the world and of His being free from it; and on the\nother hand, there is a demonstration that the influence of His\ngovernance and providence in every part of the\nworld\u2026exists\u2026 (G 1.72, P 193)\n\n\n(Given, though, that the rest of this chapter talks in Avicennian\n terms about the emanating divine overflow as it is found in active\n intellect (see sections 5\n and 6 below for more on the\n \u201cdivine overflow\u201d and \u201cactive intellect\u201d),\n and given that providence is to be understood in terms of a human\n being's own relationship\u2014via intellect\u2014to this emanating\n active intellect (as becomes clear elsewhere in the Guide (e.g. G\n 3.52, P 624-6), the overall weight of Maimonides' might be seen to\n lie with Avicenna on the side of a transcendent, emanating God).\n",
