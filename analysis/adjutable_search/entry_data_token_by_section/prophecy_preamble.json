    "main_text": "\n\nA prophet is a person who plays a special role mediating the\nrelationship between other people and the divine. Typically, a prophet\nis envisioned as a channel through which God communicates to others\nsome important information that could not have been known to the\nprophet in any ordinary way. Prophecy is interesting from a\nphilosophical point of view for many reasons, including the fact that\nit raises compelling questions about divine knowledge/ communication,\nhuman language, the nature of time, and human freedom. Unlike\ntheologians or apologists, philosophers rarely argue about who has\nactually prophesied what, or whether or not a given prophecy came\ntrue. Instead, they prefer to argue about ideal cases, where the\ntheoretical issues can be more carefully isolated, and historical\nknowledge is not needed. In this article, we will follow their lead by\nsidestepping the question of whether or not any apparent prophecies\nhave actually been fulfilled. We will also avoid the question of the\nexistence of God, which is addressed by a number of other entries in\nthis encyclopedia (see the entries listed in the \n Related Entries section below). \n",
