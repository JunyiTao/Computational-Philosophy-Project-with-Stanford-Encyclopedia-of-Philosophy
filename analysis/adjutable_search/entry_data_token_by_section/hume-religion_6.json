    "main_text": "Immortality and a Future State\n7. Immortality and a Future State\n\nAccording to Joseph Butler, an influential contemporary of\nHume\u2019s, the most important question that can possibly be asked\nis whether we are to live in a future state. It was Butler\u2019s\nview that the doctrine of future rewards and punishments is\nfundamental to religion and essential for its practical influence over\nhuman life and conduct. This view of the importance of the doctrine of\nfuture rewards and punishments was accepted by almost all the leading\ntheologians at this time (and is, of course, still widely accepted\namong religious thinkers today). It is evident that the immortality of\nthe soul is an essential part of this doctrine. For Hume\u2019s\ncontemporaries, proofs of the immortality of the soul generally\ndepended upon showing that the soul is immaterial.\n\nThere are two \u201cmetaphysical\u201d arguments that aim to\nestablish the immateriality of the soul that Hume is especially\nconcerned with. The first argument, which is Platonic in origin,\nmaintains that whereas mind is simple, unitary and indivisible, matter\nis compounded and infinitely divisible. It follows from this,\naccording to this argument, that mind is distinct from matter and that\nonly an immaterial being or substance is capable of thought and\nconsciousness. Moreover, since immaterial minds are simple and\nindivisible they are incapable of destruction and continue to exist\neternally (unless annihilated by divine power). A second and related\nargument is that it is impossible for matter and motion to produce\nthought and consciousness. For this to be possible we must suppose\nthat a cause can produce effects that possess perfections that it\nlacks. Once again, this would be to suppose that something could be\nproduced by nothing, which is absurd and contradictory.\n\nHume rejects both these metaphysical arguments for the immateriality\nand immortality of the soul. His refutations are presented, first, in\nthe Treatise 1.4.5\u20136 and, later and more briefly, in\nhis essay \u201cOf the Immortality of the Soul\u201d. (It is\npossible that this essay contains material that was originally\nintended for publication in the Treatise but was withdrawn.)\nRegarding the suggestion that thought and consciousness must belong to\nor inhere in an immaterial substance, Hume objects that we have no\nidea of either immaterial or material substance.\n\nBut just as metaphysics teach us, that the notion of substance is\nwholly confused and imperfect, and that we have no other idea of any\nsubstance than as an aggregate of particular qualities, inhering in an\nunknown something. Matter, therefore, and spirit are at bottom equally\nunknown; and we cannot determine what qualities may inhere in the one\nor in the other. (ESY, 591)\n\n\nThe important and intelligible issue, according to Hume, is not the\nquestion of the substance of thought but that concerning the cause of\nour perceptions (T, 1.4.5.29/ 246f). In respect of this issue, Hume\ninvokes his general causal maxim that \u201cany thing may produce any\nthing\u201d in order to establish that a priori it is possible that\nmatter may be the cause of thought (T, 1.4.5.30 / 247). Furthermore,\nexperience shows us, Hume maintains, that there do exist constant\nconjunctions between matter and motion, on one side, and thought and\nconsciousness on the other. Clearly, then, in so far as we have any\nidea of causation as it exists in the world, we must conclude that\nthought and consciousness can indeed arise from matter and motion (as\nthe materialists maintain). In his essay on \u201cImmortality\u201d\nHume expands on these points to argue that the evidence of experience\nshows us that thought and consciousness depends on our bodily\nexistence and, therefore, bodily death must imply death of the mind as\nwell (ESY, 596; cp. D, 6.5/171).\n\nApart from Hume\u2019s sceptical arguments directed against the\nimmateriality and immortality of the soul, he also advances sceptical\narguments concerning the doctrine of future rewards and punishments.\nIn the context of Section XI of the first Enquiry, as we have\nalready noted, Hume argues that we have no adequate evidence,\n\u201cderived from the present phenomena\u201d of this world, that a\nfuture state will correct the injustices of this world. Hume presents\nthe \u201creligionist\u201d with the following difficulty:\n\nAre there any marks of a distributive justice in this world? If you\nanswer in the affirmative, I conclude that, since justice here exerts\nitself, it is satisfied. If you reply in the negative, I conclude,\nthat you have then no reason to ascribe justice, in our sense of it,\nto the gods. If you hold a medium between affirmation and negation, by\nsaying, that the justice of the gods, at present, exerts itself in\npart but not to its full extent; I answer, that you have no reason to\ngive it any particular extent, but only so far as you see it, at\npresent, exert itself. (EU, 11.22 / 141\u20132 \u2014\nHume\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nIn the Treatise Hume advanced another set of arguments\nagainst the doctrine of a future state. In this context he argues that\nany idea or belief in life in a future state is too faint and weak to\nhave any practical influence over our passions and conduct.\n\nA future state is so far remov\u2019d from our comprehension, and we\nhave so obscure an idea of the manner, in which we shall exist after\nthe dissolution of the body, that all the reasons we can invent,\nhowever strong in themselves, and however much assisted by education,\nare never able with slow imaginations to surmount this difficulty, or\nbestow a sufficient authority and force on the idea. (T, 1.3.9.13 /\n114)\n\n\nIn general, says Hume, the lack of resemblance between this life and a\nfuture state destroys belief and, consequently, has little influence\non our passions and conduct. Hume claims \u201cthere scarce are any,\nwho believe the immortality of the soul with a true and established\njudgment\u201d (T, 1.3.9.14 / 114\u20135). The evidence for this is\nthat our conduct is usually guided with a view to the pleasures and\npains, rewards and punishments, of this life and not a future state\n(T, 1.3.9.14 / 115; cp. D, 12.13/220\u201301).\n\nHume adds a further set of objections relating to the morally\npernicious aspects of the doctrine of a future state of rewards and\npunishments. Among the several arguments that he puts forward on this\nscore, four points are especially important. In the first place, Hume\nasks, what is the point or purpose of punishment in a future state? In\nthis life we assume that punishment must not only be deserved, it must\nalso achieve some relevant social end or value (e.g., contribute to\nthe stability and peace of society). When we are removed from this\nworld these goals are taken away and punishment becomes pointlessly\nretributive (ESY, 594). The implication of this is that punishment\nwithout any further point or purpose is mere vengeance that lacks any\nproper justification. Second, Hume asks on what basis God determines\nthe extent of our merit and demerit. Among human beings the standard\nof merit and demerit depends on our moral sentiments and our sense of\npleasure and pain. Are we to suppose that God also has human passions\nand feelings of this kind? (ESY, 594,595; cp. LET, I, 40 [#16]; D,\n3.13/156) Third, the doctrine of eternal damnation clearly involves\nexcessive punishment \u2014 even for the worst of crimes. Finally,\nthe split between Heaven and Hell supposes \u201ctwo distinct species\nof men, the good and the bad. But the greatest part of mankind float\nbetween vice and virtue.\u201d (ESY, 594)\n\nHume\u2019s position on the doctrine of a future state is clear. From\nevery point of view this doctrine is considered unsound. It depends on\nmetaphysical assumptions about the nature of mind (soul) that are\nphilosophically unconvincing, involving obscure ideas that are plainly\nat odds with our everyday experience and observations concerning the\nrelationship between mind and body. It also depends on assumptions\nabout God\u2019s goodness and justice that lack any adequate\nphilosophical justification. Moreover, because the ideas and arguments\ninvolved in this doctrine are considered by Hume to be obscure and\nunconvincing, we find, in practice, that the doctrine has little or no\ninfluence in directing human conduct. Finally, not only is this\ndoctrine considered by Hume to be philosophically flawed and\npsychologically feeble, it depends on moral principles that are both\nunjust and corrupting.\n",
