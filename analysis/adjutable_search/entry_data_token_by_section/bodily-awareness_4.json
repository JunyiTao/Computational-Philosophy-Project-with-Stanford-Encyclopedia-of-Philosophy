    "main_text": "The perceptual model of bodily awareness\n2. The perceptual model of bodily awareness\n\nThe previous section highlighted that I am aware from the inside only\nof my own body. Does it prevent bodily awareness to be perceptual? Do\nthe body senses qualify as sensory modalities? Aristotle lists only\nfive of them (sight, hearing, touch, olfaction, smell) and if we added\nthe body senses, we would end up with possibly more than ten. The\nquestion then is whether these so-called body senses behave like\nsensory systems that lead to perceptual experiences. At first sight,\nit may seem that some types of bodily experiences (like touch) are\nperceptual, but not others (like pain, tickles, itches, thirst or\nhunger) because they seem subjective and incorrigible (Aydede 2009).\nBut even if we focus on transitive bodily sensations, they differ from\nvisual experiences on several respects. They are continuously active\nand they function largely outside consciousness. They often do not\nappear to provide a sensory field in which perceptual objects can be\npresented (Martin 1992, 1993; Wong 2017). Finally, there are important\nepistemic asymmetries, bodily sensations appearing as less reliable\nthan visual sensations (Munro forthcoming).\n\nSome of the worries outlined above may just evaporate if one gives up\ntheories of perception that treat vision as the paradigm of sense\nperception. It is indeed controversial that every external sense,\nincluding olfaction for example, meets all the constraints posited by\nvisuo-centric models and more recent works on perception go beyond\nvision (e.g., McPherson (ed) 2011; Matthen (ed) 2015; Gatzia &\nBroogard (eds) 2020). Furthermore, what implications, if any, do\nmultisensory effects have for the perceptual debate? In brief, as\noutlined in the previous section, I am aware that legs are crossed on\nthe basis of the integration between vision and proprioception. Does\nthe involvement of visual information suffice to make my sense of\nposture perceptual?\n\nThis section will focus on four issues: the notion of the body as a\nperceptual object, the spatial peculiarities of bodily awareness, the\nalleged epistemic failure for bodily sensations to ground bodily\nknowledge, and the relationship between bodily awareness and\naction.\n",
