    "main_text": "The Anti-Realist Challenges to Metaphysical Realism || Language Use and Understanding\n3.1 Language Use and Understanding\n\nThe first anti-realist challenge to consider focuses on the use we\nmake of our words and sentences. The challenge is simply this: what\naspect of our linguistic use could provide the necessary evidence for\nthe realist\u2019s correlation between sentences and mind-independent\nstates of affairs? Which aspects of our semantic behaviour manifest\nour grasp of these correlations, assuming they do hold?\n\nFor your representations of the world to be reliable, there must be a\ncorrelation between these representations and the states of affairs\nthey portray. So the cosmologist who utters the statement \u201cthe\nentropy of the Big Bang was remarkably low\u201d has uttered a truth\nif and only if the entropy of the Big Bang was remarkably low.\n\nA natural question to ask is how the correlation between the statement\nand the mind-independent state of affairs which makes it true is\nsupposed to be set up. One suggestive answer is that the link is\neffected by the use speakers make of their words, the statements they\nendorse and the statements they dissent from, the rationalizations\nthey provide for their actions and so forth; cognitively, it will be\nthe functional role of mental symbols in thought, perception and\nlanguage learning etc. that effects these links.\n\nHowever, when we look at how speakers actually do use their sentences,\nanti-realists argue, we see them responding not to states of affairs\nthat they cannot in general detect but rather to agreed upon\nconditions for asserting these sentences. Scientists assert \u201cthe\nentropy of the Big Bang was remarkably low\u201d because they all\nconcur that the conditions justifying this assertion have been\nmet.\n\nWhat prompts us to use our sentences in the way that we do are the\npublic justification conditions associated with those sentences,\njustification conditions forged in linguistic practices which imbue\nthese sentences with meaning.\n\nThe realist believes we are able to mentally represent\nmind-independent states of affairs. But what of cases where everything\nthat we know about the world leaves it unsettled whether the relevant\nstate of affairs obtains? Did Socrates sneeze in his sleep the night\nbefore he took the hemlock or did he not? How could we possibly find\nout? Yet realists hold that the sentence \u201cSocrates sneezed in\nhis sleep the night before he took the hemlock\u201d will be true if\nSocrates did sneeze then and false if he did not and that this is a\nsignificant semantic fact.\n\nThe Manifestation challenge to realism is to isolate some feature of\nthe use agents make of their words, or their mental symbols, which\nforges the link between mind-independent states of affairs and the\nthoughts and sentences that represent them. Nothing in the\nthinker\u2019s linguistic behaviour, according to the anti-realist,\nprovides evidence that this link has been forged\u2014linguistic use\nis keyed to public assertibility conditions, not undetectable\ntruth-conditions. In those cases, such as the Socrates one, where we\ncannot find out whether the truth-condition is satisfied or not, it is\nsimply gratuitous to believe that there is anything we can think or\nsay or do which could provide evidence that the link has been set up\nin the first place. So the anti-realist claims [Dummett 1978, 1991,\n1993; Tennant 1987, 1997; Wright 1993].\n\nWhy should we expect the evidence to be behavioural rather than, say,\nneurophysiological? The reason anti-realists give is that the meanings\nof our words and (derivatively for them) the contents of our thoughts\nare essentially communicable and thus must be open for all speakers\nand thinkers to see [Dummett 1978, 1993].\n",
