Is this or that organ or structure an\nadaptation and if so, for what? In addition, there are the\nuncertainties which result from the necessarily sparse fossil record\nof brain and sensory organ development. The EET programs are even more\nproblematic. While it is plausible enough to think that the\nevolutionary imprint on our organs of thought influences what and how\nwe do think, it is not at all clear that the influence is direct,\nsignificant or detectible. Selectionist epistemologies which endorse a\n\u201ctrial and error\u201d methodology as an appropriate model for\nunderstanding scientific change are not analytic consequences of\naccepting that the brain and other ancillary organs are adaptations\nwhich have evolved primarily under the influence of natural selection.\nThe viability of such selectionist models is an empirical question\nwhich rests on the development of adequate models. Hull\u2019s (1988)\nis, as he himself admits, but the first step in that direction. Cziko\n(1995) is a manifesto urging the development of such models (cf. also\nthe evolutionary game theory modeling approach of Harms 1997). Much\nhard empirical work needs to be done to sustain this line of research.\nNon-selectionist evolutionary epistemologies, along the lines of Ruse\n(1986), face a different range of difficulties. It remains to be shown\nthat any biological considerations are sufficiently restrictive to\nnarrow down the range of potential methodologies in any meaningful\nway. A non-selectionist approach to evolutionary epistemology, based\non \u201cPoincar\u00e9an dynamics,\u201d has been proposed by\nBarham (1990). An alternative approach, which exploits the fact that\norganisms and their environments co-evole as a result of dialectical\ninteractions between them, has led to the development of\n\u201cnon-adaptational\u201d evolutionary epistemologies (Gontier et\nal. 2006). A critical review of the problems facing the development of\nthe naturalistic turn in evolutionary epistemology can be found in\nCallebaut and Stotz (1998).\n\nNevertheless, the emergence in the latter quarter of the twentieth\ncentury of serious efforts to provide an evolutionary account of human\nunderstanding has potentially radical consequences. The application of\nselectionist models to the development of human knowledge, for\nexample, creates an immediate tension. Standard traditional accounts\nof the emergence and growth of scientific knowledge see science as a\nprogressive enterprise which, under the appropriate conditions of\nrational and free inquiry, generates a body of knowledge which\nprogressively converges on the truth. Selectionist models of\nbiological evolution, on the other hand, are generally construed to be\nnon-progressive or, at most, locally so. Rather than generating\nconvergence, biological evolution produces diversity. Popper\u2019s\nevolutionary epistemology attempts to embrace both but does so\nuneasily. Kuhn\u2019s \u201cscientific revolutions\u201d account\ndraws tentatively upon a Darwinian model, but when criticized, Kuhn\nretreated (cf. Kuhn 1962, pp. 172f with Lakatos and Musgrave 1970, p.\n264). Toulmin (1972) is a noteworthy exception. On his account,\nconcepts of rationality are purely \u201clocal\u201d and are\nthemselves subject to evolution. This, in turn, seems to entail the\nneed to abandon any sense of \u201cgoal directedness\u201d in\nscientific inquiry. This is a radical consequence which few have\nembraced. Pursuing an evolutionary approach to epistemology raises\nfundamental questions about the concepts of knowledge, truth, realism,\njustification and rationality.\n",
