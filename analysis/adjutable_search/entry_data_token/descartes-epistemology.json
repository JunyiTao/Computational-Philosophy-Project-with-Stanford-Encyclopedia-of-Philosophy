Conception of Knowledge\n1.1 Analysis of Perfect Knowledge\n\nI shall refer to the brand of knowledge Descartes seeks in the\nMeditations, as \u2018perfect knowledge\u2019 \u2013\na brand he sometimes discusses in connection with the Latin term scientia. Famously, he defines perfect knowledge in terms of doubt. While distinguishing perfect knowledge from lesser grades of conviction, he writes:\n\nI distinguish the two as follows: there is conviction\n[persuasio] when there remains some reason which might lead\nus to doubt, but knowledge [scientia] is conviction based on\na reason so strong that it can never be shaken by any stronger reason.\n(24 May 1640 letter to Regius, AT 3:65, CSMK 147)\n\n\nIn the Second Replies, he adds:\n\n\u2026 I shall now expound for a second time the basis on which\nit seems to me that all human certainty can be founded.\nFirst of all, as soon as we think that we\ncorrectly perceive something, we are spontaneously convinced that it\nis true. Now if this conviction is so firm that it is impossible for\nus ever to have any reason for doubting what we are convinced of, then\nthere are no further questions for us to ask: we have everything that\nwe could reasonably want. \u2026 For the supposition which we are\nmaking here is of a conviction so firm that it is quite incapable of\nbeing destroyed; and such a conviction is clearly the same as the most\nperfect certainty. (AT 7:144f, CSM 2:103)\n\n\nThese passages (and others) suggest an account wherein doubt is the\ncontrast of certainty. As my certainty increases, my doubt decreases;\nconversely, as my doubt increases, my certainty decreases. The\nrequirement that knowledge is to be based in complete, or perfect\ncertainty, thus amounts to requiring a complete inability to doubt\none\u2019s convictions \u2013 an utter indubitability. This\nconception of the relationship between certainty and doubt helps\nunderwrite Descartes\u2019 methodical emphasis on doubt, the\nso-called \u2018method of doubt\u2019 (discussed in\n Section 2).\n\nThat perfect knowledge requires that it be \u201cimpossible for\nus ever to have any reason for doubting what we are convinced\nof\u201d marks an extraordinarily high standard of justification.\nDoes Descartes view this as the only standard deserving of \nknowledge-talk? Arguably, no; yet this is a\ndifficult question, because he didn\u2019t write in English. He\nseems to be an epistemic contextualist, at least in the\nsense of invoking some notion of cognition, or \nknowledge, in divergent contexts presupposing different \nepistemic standards. We\u2019ll see, for example, that he holds\nthat even the deductive demonstrations of expert geometers may\nfall short of the standards needed for perfect knowledge; yet,\nthe kind of terminology he uses to characterize their epistemic \nachievements is routinely rendered in terms of knowledge-talk, in \nstandard English translations of his work.\n\nThe certainty/indubitability of interest to Descartes is psychological\nin character, though not merely psychological \u2013 not\nsimply an inexplicable feeling. It has also a distinctively epistemic\ncharacter involving a kind of rational insight. During moments of\ncertainty, it is as if my perception is guided by \u201ca great\nlight in the intellect\u201d (Med. 4, AT 7:59, CSM 2:41). This \nrational illumination empowers me to \u201csee utterly clearly\nwith my mind\u2019s eye\u201d; my feelings of certainty are\ngrounded \u2013 indeed, \u201cI see a manifest\ncontradiction\u201d in denying the proposition of which I\u2019m\nconvinced (Med. 3, AT 7:36, CSM 2:25).\n\nDescartes characterizes these epistemically impressive cognitions\nin terms of their being perceived clearly and\ndistinctly. The Meditations never defines these\nterms; indeed, it sometimes uses them in confusing ways (e.g.,\nsometimes using clarity-talk as a shorthand for the\nconjunction of clarity and distinctness). However, in the \nPrinciples Descartes offers the following definitions:\n\nI call a perception \u201cclear\u201d when it is present and\naccessible to the attentive mind \u2026 I call a perception\n\u201cdistinct\u201d if, as well as being clear, it is so sharply\nseparated from all other perceptions that it contains within itself\nonly what is clear. (Prin. 1:45, AT 8a:21f, CSM 1:207f)\n\n\nOther texts indicate that clarity contrasts with obscurity,\nand distinctness with confusedness. Though having clear and\ndistinct apprehension is epistemically impressive, we\u2019ll see\nclear texts indicating that this marks a merely necessary condition\nof perfect knowledge, not a sufficient condition.\n\nShould we regard Descartes\u2019 account of perfect knowledge as a\nversion of the justified true belief analysis of knowledge\ntracing back to Plato? The above texts are among Descartes\u2019\nclearest statements concerning perfect knowledge. Yet they raise\nquestions about the extent to which his account is continuous with\nother analyses of knowledge. Prima facie, his characterizations imply\na justified belief analysis \u2013 or, using language closer\nto his own (and where justification is construed in terms of\nunshakability), an unshakable conviction analysis.\nThere\u2019s no stated requirement that the would-be knower\u2019s\nconviction is to be true, as opposed to being unshakably\ncertain. Is truth, therefore, not a requirement of perfect\nknowledge? We\u2019ll return to the issue in\n Section 6.4.\n1.2 Internalism and Justification\n\nOne way to divide up theories of justification is in terms of the\ninternalism-externalism distinction. Very roughly: a theory of\nepistemic justification is internalist insofar as it requires\nthat the justifying factors are accessible to the knower\u2019s\nconscious awareness; it is externalist insofar as it does not\nimpose this requirement.\n\nDescartes holds an internalist account requiring that all justifying\nfactors take the form of ideas. (For a partly externalist \ninterpretation of Descartes, see Della Rocca 2005.) Various texts \nimply that ideas are, strictly speaking, the only objects of immediate \nperception or awareness. (More on the directness or immediacy of sense \nperception in \n Section 9.1.)\n Independent of assumptions about the directness of perception,\nDescartes\u2019 method of doubt underwrites an assumption with\nsimilar force: for almost the entirety of the Meditations,\nhis meditator-spokesperson \u2013 hereafter, the\n\u2018meditator\u2019 \u2013 adopts the methodological assumption\nthat all his thoughts and experiences are occurring in a dream. This\nassumption is tantamount to requiring that justification comes in the\nform of ideas, rather than via direct perception of an extramental\nworld.\n\nAn important consequence of this kind of interpretation \u2013\ni.e., a traditional representationalist understanding of ideas\n\u2013 is that rigorous philosophical inquiry must proceed via an\ninside-to-out strategy. This strategy is assiduously followed in the\nMeditations, and it endures as a hallmark of many early\nmodern epistemologies. Ultimately, all judgments are grounded in an\ninspection of the mind\u2019s own ideas. Philosophical inquiry\nis, properly understood, an investigation of ideas. The\nmethodical strategy of the Meditations has the effect of\nforcing readers to adopt this mode of inquiry.\n\nIn recent years, some commentators have questioned this traditional\nway of understanding the mediating role of ideas. Noteworthy is John\nCarriero\u2019s outstanding commentary on the Meditations\n(2009), an account providing a serious challenge to traditional\nrepresentationalist interpretations (including the kind of \ninterpretation often assumed in the present account).\n1.3 Methodist Approach\n\nHow are would-be knowers to proceed in identifying candidates\nfor perfect knowledge? Distinguish particularist and\nmethodist answers to the question. The particularist\nis apt to trust our prima facie intuitions regarding particular \nknowledge claims. These intuitions may then be used to help\nidentify more general epistemic principles. The methodist, by\ncontrast, is apt to distrust our prima facie intuitions. The\npreference is instead to begin with general principles about\nproper method. These methodical principles may then be used to\narrive at settled, reflective judgments concerning particular\nknowledge claims.\n\nFamously, Descartes is in the methodist camp. Those who haphazardly\n\u201cdirect their minds down untrodden paths\u201d are sometimes\n\u201clucky enough in their wanderings to hit upon some truth,\u201d\nbut \u201cit is far better,\u201d writes Descartes, \u201cnever to\ncontemplate investigating the truth about any matter than to do so\nwithout a method\u201d (Rules 4, AT 10:371, CSM 1:15f). Were\nwe to rely on our prima facie intuitions, we might accept that the\nearth is unmoved, or that ordinary objects (as tables and chairs)\nare just as they appear. Yet, newly emerging\nmechanist doctrines of the 17th century imply otherwise. Descartes\nthinks such cases underscore the unreliability of our prima facie\nintuitions and the need for a method by which to make epistemic\nprogress.\n\nDescartes\u2019 view is not that all our pre-reflective\nintuitions are mistaken. He concedes that \u201cno sane person has\never seriously doubted\u201d such particular claims as \u201cthat\nthere really is a world, and that human beings have bodies\u201d\n(Synopsis, AT 7:16, CSM 2:11). But such pre-reflective judgments may\nbe ill-grounded, even when true.\n\nThe dialectic of the First Meditation features a confrontation between\nparticularism and methodism, with methodism emerging the victor. For\nexample, the meditator (while voicing empiricist sensibilities) puts\nforward, as candidates for the foundations of knowledge, such prima\nfacie obvious claims as \u201cthat I am here, sitting by the fire,\nwearing a winter dressing-gown, holding this piece of paper in my\nhands, and so on\u201d \u2013 particular matters \u201cabout which\ndoubt is quite impossible,\u201d or so it would seem (AT 7:18, CSM\n2:12f). In response (and at each level of the dialectic), Descartes\ninvokes his own methodical principles to show that the prima facie\nobviousness of such particular claims is insufficient to meet the\nburden of proof.\n\nAnother methodological feature of the Meditations is its\nfirst-person, meditative character. Gary Hatfield explains.\n\nDescartes adopted the strategy of writing his Meditations as\nmeditations. In other words, he modeled his book in metaphysics and\nthe theory of knowledge (or \u201cepistemology\u201d) on a form of\nreligious writing, that of \u201cmeditations\u201d or\n\u201cspiritual exercises\u201d \u2026 In spiritual exercises,\nwhich were common in Jesuit schools such as the one Descartes attended\n(La Fl\u00e8che), readers learn to abandon the world of the senses\nand sensuality and to focus on God. \u2026 Because the\nMeditations is constructed in the hope that each reader will\ntake on the identity of the \u201cI\u201d of the narrative, the\npresumed reader of the text is called \u201cthe meditator.\u201d\n(2006, 125)\n\n1.4 Innate Ideas\n\nDescartes\u2019 commitment to innate ideas places him in a\nrationalist tradition tracing back to Plato. Knowledge of the nature\nof reality derives from ideas of the intellect, not the external\nsenses. An important part of metaphysical inquiry therefore involves\nlearning to think with the intellect. Plato\u2019s allegory of the\ncave portrays this rationalist theme in terms of epistemically\ndistinct worlds: what the senses reveal is likened to shadowy imagery\non the wall of a poorly lit cave; what the intellect reveals is\nlikened to a world of fully real beings illuminated by bright\nsunshine. The metaphor aptly depicts our epistemic predicament given\nDescartes\u2019 own doctrines. An important function of his methods\nis to help would-be perfect knowers redirect their attention from the\nconfused imagery of the senses to the luminous world of clear and\ndistinct ideas of the intellect.\n\nFurther comparisons arise with Plato\u2019s doctrine of recollection.\nIn the Fifth Meditation, in connection with the discovery of innate\ntruths within, the meditator remarks: \u201con first discovering them\nit seems that I am not so much learning something new as remembering\nwhat I knew before\u201d (Med. 5, AT 7:64, CSM 2:44). Elsewhere\nDescartes adds, of innate truths: \n\n[W]e come to know them by the power of our own native intelligence,\nwithout any sensory experience. All geometrical truths are of this\nsort \u2013 not just the most obvious ones, but all the others,\nhowever abstruse they may appear. Hence, according to Plato, Socrates\nasks a slave boy about the elements of geometry and thereby makes the\nboy able to dig out certain truths from his own mind which he had not\npreviously recognized were there, thus attempting to establish the\ndoctrine of reminiscence. Our knowledge of God is of this sort. (May\n1643 letter To Voetius, AT 8b:166f, CSMK 222f)\n\n\nThe famous \u201cwax\u201d thought experiment of the Second\nMeditation is supposed to illustrate (among other things) a procedure\nto \u201cdig out\u201d what is innate. The thought experiment\npurports to help the meditator achieve a \u201cpurely mental\nscrutiny,\u201d thereby apprehending more easily the innate idea of\nbody (Med. 2, AT 7:30f, CSM 2:20f). According to Descartes, our minds\ncome stocked with a variety of intellectual concepts \u2013 ideas\nwhose content is independent of experience. This storehouse includes\nideas in mathematics, logic, and metaphysics. Interestingly, Descartes\nholds that even our sensory ideas involve innate content. On his\nunderstanding of the new mechanical physics, bodies have no real\nproperties resembling our sensory ideas of colors, sounds, tastes, and\nthe like, thus implying that the content of such ideas draws from the\nmind itself. But if even these sensory ideas count as innate, \nhow then are we to characterize the doctrine of innateness? \nImportantly, the formation of these sensory ideas \u2013 unlike\npurely intellectual concepts \u2013 depends on sensory stimulation.\nOn one plausible understanding, Descartes\u2019 official doctrine\nhas it that ideas are innate insofar as their content derives \nfrom the nature of the mind alone, as opposed to deriving from sense \nexperience (cf. Newman 2006). This characterization allows that both \nintellectual and sensory concepts draw on native resources, though not \nto the same extent.\n\nThough the subject of rationalism or nativism\nin Descartes\u2019 epistemology deserves careful attention, the\npresent article generally focuses on Descartes\u2019 efforts to \nachieve perfect knowledge. Relatively little attention is given to\nhis doctrine of innateness, or, more generally, his ontology of \nthought. (For further discussion of his commitment to innateness, \nsee Adams 1975, Jolley 1990, Newman 2006, and Nelson 2007.)\n2. The Methods: Foundationalism and Doubt\n\nOf his own methodology, Descartes writes:\n\nThroughout my writings I have made it clear that my method imitates\nthat of the architect. When an architect wants to build a house which\nis stable on ground where there is a sandy topsoil over underlying\nrock, or clay, or some other firm base, he begins by digging out a set\nof trenches from which he removes the sand, and anything resting on or\nmixed in with the sand, so that he can lay his foundations on firm\nsoil. In the same way, I began by taking everything that was doubtful\nand throwing it out, like sand \u2026 (Replies 7, AT 7:536f, CSM\n2:366)\n\n\nThe theory whereby items of knowledge are best organized on an analogy\nto architecture traces back to ancient Greek thought \u2013 to\nAristotle, and to work in geometry. That Descartes\u2019 method\neffectively pays homage to Aristotle is, of course, a welcome result\nfor his Aristotelian audience. But Descartes views Aristotle\u2019s\nfoundationalist principles as incomplete, at least when applied to\nmetaphysical inquiry. His method of doubt is intended to complement\nfoundationalism. The two methods are supposed to work in cooperation,\nas conveyed in the above quotation. Let\u2019s consider each\nmethod.\n2.1 Foundationalism\n\nThe central insight of foundationalism is to organize knowledge in the\nmanner of a well-structured, architectural edifice. Such an edifice\nowes its structural integrity to two kinds of features: a firm\nfoundation and a superstructure of support beams\nfirmly anchored to the foundation. A system of justified beliefs might\nbe organized by two analogous features: a foundation of unshakable\nfirst principles, and a superstructure of further propositions\nanchored to the foundation via unshakable inference.\n\nExemplary of a foundationalist system is Euclid\u2019s geometry.\nEuclid begins with a foundation of first principles \u2013\ndefinitions, postulates, and axioms or common notions \u2013 on\nwhich he then bases a superstructure of further propositions.\nDescartes\u2019 own designs for metaphysical knowledge are inspired\nby Euclid\u2019s system:\n\nThose long chains composed of very simple and easy reasoning,\nwhich geometers customarily use to arrive at their most difficult\ndemonstrations, had given me occasion to suppose that all the things\nwhich can fall under human knowledge are interconnected in the same\nway. (Discourse 2, AT 6:19, CSM 1:120).\n\n\nIt would be misleading to characterize the arguments of the\nMeditations as unfolding straightforwardly according to\ngeometric method (cf. Curley 2006, 31). But Descartes maintains\nthat they can be reconstructed as such, and he expressly\ndoes so at the end of the Second Replies \u2013 providing a\n\u201cgeometrical\u201d exposition of some of his central lines\nof argument, organized as definitions, postulates,\naxioms or common notions, and propositions (AT\n7:160\u201370, CSM 2:113\u2013120).\n\nAs noted above, the Meditations contains a destructive\ncomponent that Descartes likens to the architect\u2019s preparations\nfor laying a foundation. Though the component finds no analogue in the\nmethods of geometers, Descartes appears to hold that it is needed in\nmetaphysical inquiry. The discovery of Euclid\u2019s first principles\n(some of them, at any rate) is comparatively unproblematic: such\nprinciples as that things which are equal to the same thing are\nalso equal to one another accord not only with reason, but with\nthe senses. In contrast, metaphysical inquiry might have first\nprinciples that conflict with the senses:\n\nThe difference is that the primary notions which\nare presupposed for the demonstration of geometrical truths are\nreadily accepted by anyone, since they accord with the use of our\nsenses. Hence there is no difficulty there, except in the proper\ndeduction of the consequences, which can be done even by the less\nattentive, provided they remember what has gone before. \u2026 \nIn metaphysics by contrast there is nothing which causes so much\neffort as making our perception of the primary notions clear and\ndistinct. Admittedly, they are by their nature as evident as, or even\nmore evident than, the primary notions which the geometers study; but\nthey conflict with many preconceived opinions derived from the senses\nwhich we have got into the habit of holding from our earliest years,\nand so only those who really concentrate and meditate and withdraw\ntheir minds from corporeal things, so far as possible, will achieve\nperfect knowledge of them.  (Replies 2, AT 7:156f, CSM 2:111)\n\n\nAmong Descartes\u2019 persistent themes is that such preconceived\nopinions can obscure our mental vision of innate principles:\nwhere there are disputes about first principles, it is not\n\u201cbecause one man\u2019s faculty of knowledge extends more\nwidely than another\u2019s, but because the common notions are in\nconflict with the preconceived opinions of some people who, as a\nresult, cannot easily grasp them\u201d; whereas, \u201cwe cannot\nfail to know them [innate common notions] when the occasion for\nthinking about them arises, provided that we are not blinded by\npreconceived opinions\u201d (Prin. 1:49f, AT 8a:24, CSM\n1:209). These \u201cpreconceived opinions\u201d must be \u201cset\naside,\u201d says Descartes, \u201cin order to lay the first\nfoundations of philosophy\u201d (May 1643 letter to Voetius, AT\n8b:37, CSMK 221). Otherwise, we\u2019re apt to regard, as\nfirst principles, the mistaken (though prima facie obvious) sensory\nclaims that particularists find attractive. Such mistakes in the\nlaying of the foundations weaken the entire edifice. Descartes\nadds:\n\nAll the mistakes made in the sciences happen, in my view, simply\nbecause at the beginning we make judgements too hastily, and accept as\nour first principles matters which are obscure and of which we do not\nhave a clear and distinct notion. (Search, AT 10:526, CSM\n2:419)\n\n\nThough foundationalism brilliantly allows for the expansion of\nknowledge from first principles, Descartes thinks that a complementary\nmethod is needed to help us discover genuine first principles. As\nHatfield writes, \u201cthe problem is not to carry out proofs (which\nmight well be assented to, given the definitions and axioms), but to\ndiscover the axioms themselves (which are hopelessly obscured by the\nprejudices of the senses)\u201d (1986, 71). Descartes therefore\ndevises the method of doubt for this purpose \u2013 a method to help\n\u201cset aside\u201d preconceived opinions.\n\n(For examples of non-foundationist interpretations, see Bennett 1990,\nFrankfurt 1970, Sosa 1997a, and Della Rocca 2011.)\n2.2 Method of Doubt\n\nDescartes opens the First Meditation asserting the need \u201cto\ndemolish everything completely and start again right from the\nfoundations\u201d (AT 7:17, CSM 2:12). The passage adds:\n\nReason now leads me to think that I should hold back my assent from\nopinions which are not completely certain and indubitable just as\ncarefully as I do from those which are patently false. So, for the\npurpose of rejecting all my opinions, it will be enough if I find in\neach of them at least some reason for doubt. (AT 7:18, CSM 2:12)\n\n\nIn the architectural analogy, we can think of bulldozers as the\nground-clearing tools of demolition. For knowledge building,\nDescartes construes sceptical doubts as the ground-clearing tools of\nepistemic demolition. Bulldozers undermine literal ground;\ndoubt undermines epistemic ground. Using sceptical doubts, the\nmeditator shows how to find \u201csome reason for doubt\u201d in all\nhis preexisting claims to knowledge.\n\nThe ultimate aim of the method is constructive. Unlike \u201cthe\nsceptics, who doubt only for the sake of doubting,\u201d Descartes\naims \u201cto reach certainty \u2013 to cast aside the loose earth\nand sand so as to come upon rock or clay\u201d (Discourse 3,\nAT 6:29, CSM 1:125). Bulldozers are typically used for destructive\nends, as are sceptical doubts. Descartes\u2019 methodical innovation\nis to employ demolition for constructive ends. Where a\nbulldozer\u2019s force overpowers the ground, its effects are\ndestructive. Where the ground\u2019s firmness resists the\nbulldozer\u2019s force, the bulldozer might be used constructively\n\u2013 using it to reveal the ground as firm. Descartes thus\nuses sceptical doubts to test the firmness of candidates put forward\nfor the foundations of knowledge.\n\nAccording to at least one prominent critic, this employment of\nsceptical doubt is unnecessary and excessive. Writes Gassendi:\n\nThere is just one point I am not clear about, namely why you did not\nmake a simple and brief statement to the effect that you were\nregarding your previous knowledge as uncertain so that you could later\nsingle out what you found to be true. Why instead did you consider\neverything as false, which seems more like adopting a new\nprejudice than relinquishing an old one? This strategy made it\nnecessary for you to convince yourself by imagining a deceiving\nGod or some evil demon who tricks us, whereas it would surely\nhave been sufficient to cite the darkness of the human mind or the\nweakness of our nature. (Objs. 5, AT 7:257f, CSM 2:180; italics added)\n\n\nHere, Gassendi singles out two features of methodical doubt \u2013\nits universal and hyperbolic character. In reply,\nDescartes remarks:\n\nYou say that you approve of my project for freeing my mind from\npreconceived opinions; and indeed no one can pretend that such a\nproject should not be approved of. But you would have preferred\nme to have carried it out by making a \u201csimple and brief\nstatement\u201d \u2013 that is, only in a perfunctory fashion. Is\nit really so easy to free ourselves from all the errors which we have\nsoaked up since our infancy? Can we really be too careful in carrying\nout a project which everyone agrees should be performed? (Replies 5,\nAT 7:348, CSM 2:241f)\n\n\nEvidently, Descartes holds that the universal and\nhyperbolic character of methodical doubt is helpful to its\nsuccess. Further appeal to the architectural analogy helps elucidate\nwhy.\n\nConsider first the universal character of doubt \u2013 the\nneed \u201cto demolish everything completely and start again right\nfrom the foundations.\u201d The point is not merely to apply doubt to\nall candidates for perfect knowledge, but to apply doubt\ncollectively. Descartes offers the following analogy:\n\nSuppose [a person] had a basket full of apples and, being worried that\nsome of the apples were rotten, wanted to take out the rotten ones to\nprevent the rot spreading. How would he proceed? Would he not begin by\ntipping the whole lot out of the basket? And would not the next step\nbe to cast his eye over each apple in turn, and pick up and put back\nin the basket only those he saw to be sound, leaving the others? In\njust the same way, those who have never philosophized correctly have\nvarious opinions in their minds which they have begun to store up\nsince childhood, and which they therefore have reason to believe may\nin many cases be false. They then attempt to separate the false\nbeliefs from the others, so as to prevent their contaminating the rest\nand making the whole lot uncertain. Now the best way they can\naccomplish this is to reject all their beliefs together in one go, as\nif they were all uncertain and false. They can then go over each\nbelief in turn and re-adopt only those which they recognize to be true\nand indubitable. (Replies 7, AT 7:481, CSM 2:324)\n\n\nThat even one falsehood would be mistakenly treated as a genuine\nfirst principle \u2013 say, the belief that the senses are\nreliable, or that ancient authorities should be trusted\n\u2013 threatens to spread falsehood to other beliefs in the system.\nA collective doubt helps avoid such mistakes. It ensures that the\nmethod only approves candidate first principles that are unshakable in\ntheir own right: it rules out that the appearance of unshakability is\nowed to logical relations with other principles, themselves not\nsubjected to doubt.\n\nHow is the hyperbolic character of methodical doubt supposed\nto contribute to the method\u2019s success? The architectural analogy\nis again helpful. Suppose that an architect is vigilant in employing a\nuniversal/collective doubt. Suppose, further, that she attempts to use\nepistemic bulldozers for constructive purposes. A problem nonetheless \narises. How big a bulldozer is she to use? A light-duty bulldozer\nmight be unable to distinguish a medium-sized boulder from immovable \nbedrock. In both cases, the ground would appear immovable. \nDescartes takes the solution to lie in using not light-duty, but\nheavy-duty tools of demolition \u2013 the bigger the\nbulldozer, the better. The lesson is clear for the epistemic builder:\nthe more hyperbolic the doubt, the better.\n\nA potential problem remains. Does not the problem of the\n\u201clight-duty bulldozer\u201d repeat itself? No matter how\nfirm one\u2019s ground, might it not be dislodged in the face of\na yet bigger bulldozer? This raises the worry that there might not\nbe unshakable ground, as opposed to ground which\nis yet unshaken. Descartes\u2019 goal of utterly\nindubitable epistemic ground may simply be elusive.\n\nAt this juncture, perhaps the architectural analogy breaks down\nin a manner that serves Descartes well. For though there is no \nmost-powerful literal bulldozer, perhaps epistemic\nbulldozing is not subject to this limitation. Descartes seems\nto think that there is a most-powerful doubt\n\u2013 a doubt than which none more hyperbolic can be conceived.\nThe Evil Genius Doubt (and equivalent doubts) is supposed to\nfit the bill. If the method reveals epistemic ground that stands\nfast in the face of a doubt this hyperbolic, then, as \nDescartes seems to hold, this counts as epistemic bedrock if\nanything does.\n\nHence the importance of the universal and hyperbolic\ncharacter of the method of doubt. Gassendi\u2019s suggestion that we\nforego methodical doubt in favor of a \u201csimple and brief\nstatement to the effect that [we\u2019re] regarding [our] previous\nknowledge as uncertain\u201d misses an important, intended point\nof the method.\n\nDescartes\u2019 method of doubt has been subject to numerous\nobjections \u2013 some fair, others less so. Rendered in the terms\nDescartes himself employs, the method is arguably less flawed than its\nreputation. Let us consider some of the common objections. Two such\nobjections are suggested in a passage from the pragmatist Peirce:\n\nWe cannot begin with complete doubt. We must begin with all the\nprejudices which we actually have when we enter upon the study of\nphilosophy. These prejudices are not to be dispelled by a maxim [viz.,\nthe maxim that the philosopher \u201cmust begin with universal\ndoubt\u201d], for they are things which it does not occur to us\ncan be questioned. Hence this initial skepticism will be a\nmere self-deception, and not real doubt \u2026 A person may, it is\ntrue, in the course of his studies, find reason to doubt what he began\nby believing; but in that case he doubts because he has a positive\nreason for it, and not on account of the Cartesian maxim. Let us not\npretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts.\n(1955, 228f)\n\n\nNote, however, that the procedure of the Meditations is not\nthat universal doubt is supposed to flow simply from adherence to a\nmaxim; to the contrary, the doubt is supposed to flow from careful\nattention to positive reasons for doubt \u2013 recall the express\nresolution to find \u201cat least some reason for doubt\u201d in\none\u2019s prior opinions. Descartes introduces sceptical arguments\nprecisely in acknowledgement that we need such reasons:\n\nI did say that there was some difficulty in expelling from our belief\neverything we have previously accepted. One reason for this is that\nbefore we can decide to doubt, we need some reason for doubting; and\nthat is why in my First Meditation I put forward the principal reasons\nfor doubt. (Replies 5, appendix, AT 9a:204, CSM 2:270)\n\n\nA second objection arises from Peirce\u2019s contention\nthat we should \u201cnot pretend to doubt in philosophy\nwhat we do not doubt in our hearts\u201d. Descartes\npresumably agrees that hyperbolic doubt is not (what Peirce\ncalls) a \u201cdoubt in our hearts\u201d \u2013 recall\nhis concession that \u201cno sane person has ever seriously\ndoubted\u201d such claims as \u201cthat there really is a\nworld, and that human beings have bodies\u201d \n(AT 7:16, CSM 2:11).  Further, Descartes makes clear that\nwe should not extend hyperbolic doubt to practical\nmatters:\n\nI made a very careful distinction between the conduct of life\nand the contemplation of the truth. As far as the conduct of\nlife is concerned, I am very far from thinking that we should\nassent only to what is clearly perceived. \u2026 from time\nto time we will have to choose one of many alternatives about\nwhich we have no knowledge \u2026  (Replies 2, AT 7:149,\nCSM 2:106)\n\n\nElsewhere, Descartes illustrates the danger in applying \nhyperbolic doubt to practical contexts, with an example of \nsomeone who \u201cdecided to abstain from all food to the\npoint of starvation, because he was not certain that it was\nnot poisoned\u201d \u2013 a scenario wherein the person \n\u201cwould be rightly regarded as insane\u201d (AT 3:422,\nCSMK 189).  Such dangers, however, do not arise in\nconnection with theoretical matters, including those\npursued in the Meditations. An essential\ncomponent of Descartes\u2019 constructive epistemology\nis the distinction between matters to which we have\nalways given assent, in spite of their being\ndoubtful, and matters to which we cannot but\nassent while perceiving them clearly and distinctly. \nHyperbolic doubt is supposed to show that our previous\nopinions are likely of a piece with the former; yet,\nperfect knowledge is built from the latter.  The emphasis\non doubt is intended to help counter-balance our \u201chabit\nof confidently assenting to\u201d what we regard as \n\u201chighly probable opinions,\u201d on the grounds that\nsuch matters seem \u201cmuch more reasonable to believe\nthan to deny\u201d (Med. 1, AT 7:15, CSM 2:22). The\nmeditator thus adopts the attitude of methodical doubt\nwhereby all candidates for belief are treated as if\nfalse: \u201cit will be a good plan to turn my will in\ncompletely the opposite direction and deceive myself, by\npretending for a time that these former opinions are utterly\nfalse and imaginary\u201d (ibid.) \u2013 a plan\nthat is carried out precisely by subjecting all matters to\nhyperbolic doubt.\n\nA related objection takes the method to require not merely doubt,\nbut disbelief or dissent. One of Gassendi\u2019s objections reads\nin this manner. He seems to take Descartes to be urging us, quite\nliterally, to \u201cconsider everything as false,\u201d a strategy\nwhich, as he says to Descartes, \u201cmade it necessary for you to\nconvince yourself\u201d of the sceptical hypotheses(Objs. 5, AT \n7:257f, CSM 2:180). Based on Descartes\u2019 most careful statements, \nhowever, his method does not require a dissent from the statements it \nundermines. Rather, the method urges us to \u201chold back [our] \nassent from opinions which are not completely certain and indubitable \njust as carefully as [we] do from those which are patently false\u201d \n(Med. 1, AT 7:18, CSM 2:12, cf. AT 7:461).\n\nFinally, a common objection has it that the universality of doubt\nundermines the method of doubt itself, since, for example,\nthe sceptical hypotheses themselves are dubious. Descartes\nthinks this mistakes the intended scope of the method: namely, to \nextend doubt universally to candidates for knowledge, but\nnot also to the very tools for founding knowledge. As he concedes: \n\u201cthere may be reasons which are strong enough to compel us to \ndoubt, even though these reasons are themselves doubtful, and hence\nare not to be retained later on\u201d (Replies 7, AT 7:473f, CSM \n2:319).\n\n(For further discussion of Descartes\u2019s method of doubt, see\nFrankfurt 1970, Garber 1986, Larmore 2014, Newman 2006, Williams 1983,\nand Wilson 1978.)\n3. First Meditation Doubting Arguments\n3.1 Dreaming Doubts\n\nHistorically, there are at least two distinct dream-related doubts.\nThe one doubt undermines the judgment that I am presently\nawake \u2013 call this the \u2018Now Dreaming Doubt\u2019. The\nother doubt undermines the judgment that I am ever awake\n(i.e., in the way normally supposed) \u2013 call this the\n\u2018Always Dreaming Doubt\u2019. A textual case can be made on\nbehalf of both formulations being raised in the\nMeditations.\n\nBoth doubts appeal to some version of the thesis that the experiences\nwe take as dreams are (at their best) qualitatively similar to those\nwe take as waking \u2013 call this the \u2018Similarity\nThesis\u2019. The Similarity Thesis may be formulated in a variety of\nstrengths. A strong Similarity Thesis might contend that some dreams\nseem experientially similar to waking, even on hindsight, subsequent\nto waking; a weaker rendering of the thesis might contend merely that\ndreams seem similar to waking while having them, but\nnot upon waking. Arguably, the sceptical doubt is equally potent on\neither rendering. Even so, on the most natural reading the First\nMeditation passage seems to suggest the stronger view, with its\nreference to \u201cexactly similar thoughts\u201d:\n\nHow often, asleep at night, am I convinced of just such familiar\nevents \u2013 that I am here in my dressing-gown, sitting by the fire\n\u2013 when in fact I am lying undressed in bed! Yet at the moment my\neyes are certainly wide awake when I look at this piece of paper; I\nshake my head and it is not asleep; as I stretch out and feel my hand\nI do so deliberately, and I know what I am doing. All this would not\nhappen with such distinctness to someone asleep. Indeed! As if I did\nnot remember other occasions when I have been tricked by exactly\nsimilar thoughts while asleep! (AT 7:19, CSM 2:13)\n\n\nAs for the range of experiences that we can suppose dreams to be \ncapable of imitating, Descartes looks to hold that every\nkind of sensory experience is plausibly reproducible in dreams,\nand thereby subject to doubt. He writes: \u201cevery sensory \nexperience I have ever thought I was having while awake I can\nalso think of myself as sometimes having while asleep\u201d\n(Med. 6, AT 7:77, CSM 2:53).\n\nThe Similarity Thesis is sufficient to generate straightaway\nthe Now Dreaming Doubt. Since I can think of a dream as being \nqualitatively similar to my present experience, then, for all\nI know, I am now dreaming. I might be awake. But if,\nfor all I know, I am now dreaming, then I lack perfect knowledge\nof any matters whose truth presupposes that I am now awake. The\nNow Dreaming Doubt does its epistemic damage so long as it\nundermines my reasons for believing I\u2019m awake. And at this\nstage of the Meditations, Descartes thinks that it does: \n\u201cthere are never any sure signs by means of which being\nawake can be distinguished from being asleep\u201d (Med. 1, AT\n7:19, CSM 2:13).\n\nThe Now Dreaming Doubt generates widespread sceptical\nconsequences. For if I do not perfectly know that I am now\nawake, then neither do I know that I\u2019m now \u201cholding \nthis piece of paper in my hands,\u201d to cite an example \nthe First Meditation meditator had supposed to be \u201cquite \nimpossible\u201d to doubt. Reflection on the sceptical doubt\nchanges his mind, and he comes around to the view that, for all\nhe knows, the sensible objects of his present experience are\nmere figments of a vivid dream.\n\nMuch ado has been made about whether dreaming arguments are\nself-refuting. According to an influential objection, similarity\ntheses presuppose that we can reliably distinguish dreams\nand waking \u2013 we need first to distinguish them, in order to \ncompare them; yet the conclusion of dreaming arguments entails that\nwe cannot reliably distinguish them. Therefore, if the \nconclusion of such an argument is true, then the premise invoking\nthe Similarity Thesis cannot be.\n\nSome formulations of dreaming arguments are indeed self-refuting\nin this way. Of present interest is whether all\nare \u2013 specifically, whether Descartes makes the mistake.\nIt would appear that he does not, based on a Sixth Meditation\npassage summarizing the earlier doubts. There, his formulation \npresupposes simply the truism that we do, in fact, make a\ndistinction between waking and dreaming (never mind whether\nreliably). He states the relevant premise in terms of what we \nthink of as waking, versus what we think of\nas dreaming: \u201cevery sensory experience I have ever \nthought I was having while awake I can also think\nof myself as sometimes having while asleep\u201d (AT 7:77, CSM\n2:53, italics added). This formulation avoids the charge of\nself-refutation, for it is compatible with the conclusion that\nwe cannot reliably distinguish dreams and waking.\n\nDoes Descartes also put forward a second dreaming argument, the Always\nDreaming Doubt? There is strong textual evidence to support this (see\nNewman 1994), though it is by no means the standard interpretation.\nThe conclusion of the Always Dreaming Doubt is generated from the very\nsame Similarity Thesis, together with a further sceptical assumption,\nnamely: that for all I know, the processes producing what I take as\nwaking are no more veridical than those producing what I take as\ndreams. As the meditator puts it: \n\n[E]very sensory experience I have ever thought I was having while\nawake I can also think of myself as sometimes having while asleep; and\nsince I do not believe that what I seem to perceive in sleep comes\nfrom things located outside me, I did not see why I should be any more\ninclined to believe this of what I think I perceive while awake. (Med.\n6, AT 7:77, CSM 2:53)\n\n\nThe aim of the Always Dreaming Doubt is to undermine not whether\nI\u2019m now awake, but whether so-called \u201csensation\u201d is\nproduced by external objects even on the assumption that I am\nnow awake. For in the cases of both waking and dreaming, my cognitive\naccess extends only to the productive result, but not the\nproductive process. On what basis, then, do I conclude that\nthe productive processes are different \u2013 with external objects\nplaying more of a role in waking than in dreaming? For all I know,\nboth sorts of experience are produced by some subconscious faculty\nof my mind. As Descartes has his meditator say:\n\n[T]here may be some other faculty [of my mind] not yet fully known to\nme, which produces these ideas without any assistance from external\nthings; this is, after all, just how I have always thought ideas are\nproduced in me when I am dreaming. (Med. 3, AT 7:39, CSM 2:27)\n\n\nThe sceptical consequences of the Always Dreaming Doubt are even\nmore devastating than those of the Now Dreaming Doubt. If I do not\nperfectly know that \u201cnormal waking\u201d experience is\nproduced by external objects, then, for all I know, all\nof my experiences might be dreams of a sort. For all I\nknow, there might not be an external world. My best\nevidence of an external world derives from my preconceived opinion\nthat external world objects produce my waking experiences. Yet the \nAlways Dreaming Doubt calls this into question:\n\nAll these considerations are enough to establish that it is not\nreliable judgement but merely some blind impulse that has made me\nbelieve up till now that there exist things distinct from myself which\ntransmit to me ideas or images of themselves through the sense organs\nor in some other way. (Med. 3, AT 7:40, CSM 2:27)\n\n\nThe two dreaming doubts are parasitic on the same Similarity Thesis,\nthough their sceptical consequences differ. The Now Dreaming Doubt\nraises the universal possibility of delusion: for any one of\nmy sensory experiences, it is possible (for all I know) that the\nexperience is delusive. The Always Dreaming Doubt raises the\npossibility of universal delusion: it is possible (for all I\nknow) that all my sensory experiences are delusions (say, from a\nGod\u2019s-eye perspective).\n3.2 Evil Genius Doubt\n\nThough dreaming doubts do significant demolition work, they are\nlight-duty bulldozers relative to Descartes\u2019 most power\nsceptical doubt. What further judgments are left to be undermined?\nImmediately after the discussion of dreaming, the meditator\ntentatively concludes that the results of empirical disciplines \n\u201care doubtful\u201d \u2013 e.g., \u201cphysics, astronomy,\nmedicine,\u201d and the like. Whereas:\n\n[A]rithmetic, geometry and other subjects of this kind, which deal\nonly with the simplest and most general things, regardless of whether\nthey really exist in nature or not, contain something certain and\nindubitable. For whether I am awake or asleep, two and three added\ntogether are five, and a square has no more than four sides. It seems\nimpossible that such transparent truths should incur any suspicion of\nbeing false. (Med. 1, AT 7:20, CSM 2:14)\n\n\nEarly in the Third Meditation, it emerges that even truths this\n\u201csimple and straightforward\u201d are subject to hyperbolic\ndoubt (AT 7:35f, CSM 2:25). And immediately following the above First\nMeditation passage, Descartes introduces his most hyperbolic doubt\n\u2013 the hypothesis of an all-powerful deceiver.\n\nThere is variation in the interpretation of the doubt, even\nconcerning the number of deceivers Descartes means to be citing. \nHowever, I suggest that there is a very natural reading that provides \nfor a unified understanding of a single deceiver hypothesis.\n\nThe passage initially introducing a deceiver represents the\nmeditator as having long believed in a creator who is both\nall-powerful and all-good. It seems to follow (so the meditator \nreasons) that a creator with these attributes would not allow its \ncreatures to be deceived about the existence of the external world,\nnor about such transparent truths as that 2+3=5. But likewise,\nneither should a creator with these attributes allow its creatures \never to be deceived. Yet we are sometimes\ndeceived. Since even occasional deception seems to pose a \nreductio on the very existence of an all-powerful,\nall-good creator, the implication is that the creator (if there\nbe one) must be lacking in either power or goodness. Suppose the \ncreator is all-powerful but not all-good \u2013 i.e., an \n\u201cevil genius\u201d of sorts. In that case, it seems we might\nbe deceived about even the most evident of matters.\n\nNotice that this foregoing understanding allows us to read the \nfollowing two passages as referring to the very same sceptical\nscenario \u2013 namely, a worry about a deceiver who\u2019s all-powerful, but not all-good:\n\n\nAnd yet firmly rooted in my mind is the long-standing opinion that\nthere is an omnipotent God who made me the kind of creature that I am.\nHow do I know that he has not brought it about that there is no earth,\nno sky, no extended thing, no shape, no size, no place, while at the\nsame time ensuring that all these things appear to me to exist just as\nthey do now? What is more, since I sometimes believe that others go\nastray in cases where they think they have the most perfect knowledge,\nmay I not similarly go wrong every time I add two and three or count\nthe sides of a square, or in some even simpler matter, if that is\nimaginable? But perhaps God would not have allowed me to be deceived\nin this way, since he is said to be supremely good. But if it were\ninconsistent with his goodness to have created me such that I am\ndeceived all the time, it would seem equally foreign to his goodness\nto allow me to be deceived even occasionally; yet this last assertion\ncannot be made. (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14)\n\nI will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the\nsource of truth, but rather some malicious demon [mauvais\ng\u00e9nie] of the utmost power and cunning has employed all\nhis energies in order to deceive me. (AT 7:21, CSM 2:15)\n\n\nSome commentators take these passages to introduce two separate\ndeceivers \u2013 a deceiving God, on the one hand, and an evil\ngenius (mauvais g\u00e9nie), on the other hand (cf. \nGouhier 1937, 163). Yet this seems to introduce needless\ncomplication without sufficient textual justification. The\ndeceptions of both deceivers are said to derive from having\nsupreme power, while (unlike the true God) lacking in goodness.\nAnd note that Descartes expresses ambivalence as to whether even\nto refer to a deceiver as \u2018God\u2019: while invoking\nhyperbolic doubt, the Second Meditation references the deceiver\nas \u201ca God, or whatever I may call him\u201d (AT 7:24,\nCSM 2:16). In any case, a single deceiver hypothesis will\nhereafter be assumed, referring to it by its popular designation,\nthe \u2018Evil Genius Doubt\u2019.\n\nIt is tempting to assume that the Evil Genius Doubt draws its\nsceptical force from the \u201cutmost power\u201d attributed to the\ndeceiver. Clear texts suggest a different reading. Descartes contends\nthat an equally powerful doubt derives from the supposition that we\nare not the creatures of an all-powerful creator. Recall that the\nabove reductio reasoning implies simply that the creator\ncannot be both all-powerful and all-good. Suppose, then, that we\ngive-up the assumption that the creator is all-powerful. The passage\ncontinues \u2013 while denying that the doubt is thereby weakened:\n\nPerhaps there may be some who would prefer to deny the existence of so\npowerful a God rather than believe that everything else is uncertain.\n\u2026 yet since deception and error seem to be imperfections, the\nless powerful they make my original cause, the more likely it is that\nI am so imperfect as to be deceived all the time. (AT 7:21, CSM 2:14)\n\n\nDescartes makes the same point in a parallel passage of the \nPrinciples:\n\n[W]e have been told that there is an omnipotent God who created us.\nNow we do not know whether he may have wished to make us beings of the\nsort who are always deceived even in those matters which seem to us\nsupremely evident \u2026 We may of course suppose that our existence\nderives not from a supremely powerful God but either from ourselves or\nfrom some other source; but in that case, the less powerful we make\nthe author of our coming into being, the more likely it will be that\nwe are so imperfect as to be deceived all the time. (Prin.\n1:5, AT 8a:6, CSM 1:194)\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 official position is that the Evil Genius Doubt is\nmerely one among multiple hypotheses that can motivate the more\ngeneral hyperbolic doubt. (See Cunning 2014, 68ff, and Hatfield 2006,\n126, for variations on this theme.) Fundamentally, the more general\ndoubt is about our cognitive nature, that is, about the\npossibility that our minds are flawed. The First Meditation texts\nare somewhat ambiguous on this count. But later passages are very\nclear\n(a theme we\u2019ll develop more fully in\n Section 4.3).\n\nWhat is essential to the doubt is not the specific story about the\norigin of our cognitive wiring; it\u2019s instead the realization\n\u2013 regardless the story \u2013 that for all we know, our\ncognitive wiring is flawed. Even so, I regularly speak in terms of the\nevil genius (following Descartes\u2019 lead), as a kind of\nmnemonic for the more general doubt about our cognitive nature.\n\nHaving introduced the Evil Genius Doubt, the First Meditation program\nof demolition is not only hyperbolic but universal.\nAs the meditator remarks, I \u201cam finally compelled to admit that\nthere is not one of my former beliefs about which a doubt may not\nproperly be raised\u201d (Med. 1, AT 7:21, CSM 2:14f). As will\nemerge, the early paragraphs of the Third Meditation clarify a further\nnuance of the Evil Genius Doubt \u2013 a nuance consistently observed\nthereafter. Descartes clarifies, there, that the Evil Genius Doubt\noperates in an indirect manner (a topic to which we return in\n Section 4.3).\n\n(For examples of alternative interpretations of the Evil Genius Doubt, \nsee Gewirth 1941 and Wilson 1978.)\n4. The Cogito and Doubt\n4.1 Cogito Ergo Sum\n\nFamously, Descartes puts forward a very simple candidate as\n(what CSM translate as being) the \u201cfirst item of knowledge\n[cognition]\u201d (Med. 3, AT 7:35, CSM 2:24). The\ncandidate is suggested by methodical doubt \u2013 by the very\neffort at thinking all my thoughts might be mistaken.\nEarly in the Second Meditation, the meditator observes:\n\nI have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world,\nno sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too\ndo not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I certainly\nexisted. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is\ndeliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too\nundoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as\nmuch as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long\nas I think that I am something. So after considering everything very\nthoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, I\nam, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put\nforward by me or conceived in my mind. (AT 7:25, CSM 2:16f)\n\n\nAs the canonical formulation has it, I think therefore I\nam (Latin: cogito ergo sum; French: je pense, \ndonc je suis) \u2013 a formulation that does not\nexpressly appear in the Meditations. Descartes regards\nthe \u2018cogito\u2019 (as it is often referred to) as\nthe \u201cfirst and most certain of all to occur to anyone who\nphilosophizes in an orderly way\u201d (Prin. 1:7, AT8a:7,\nCSM 1:195).\n\nIs the great certainty of the cogito supposed to attach\nto the \u201cI think,\u201d the \u201cI am,\u201d or the\n\u201ctherefore\u201d (i.e., their logical relation)? Presumably,\nit must attach to all of these, if the cogito is to play the\nfoundational role Descartes assigns to it. But this answer can seem to\ndepend on whether the cogito is understood as an inference or\nan intuition \u2013 an issue we address below.\n\nTesting the cogito by means of methodical doubt is supposed\nto reveal its unshakable certainty. Hyperbolic doubt helps me\nappreciate that the existence of my body is subject to doubt, whereas\nthe existence of my thinking is not. The very attempt at thinking\naway my thinking is indeed self-stultifying.\n\nThe cogito raises numerous philosophical questions and has\ngenerated an enormous literature. The most significant ongoing debate\nconcerns whether Descartes intends the cogito to be an\nintuition (i.e., roughly, self-evident), or instead an\ninference.\n\nIn an influential 1962 paper, Jaakko Hintikka\u2019s argues that it\n\nshould be understood non-inferentially, as a performative utterance.\nOn his analysis, I exist doesn\u2019t follow logically from\nI think, nor does Descartes suppose otherwise. Rather, the\ntransition from I think to I exist is non-logical\n\u2013 indeed, the statement that \u201cI do not exist\u201d is not\nlogically incoherent. The key point, according to Hintikka, is that\nthe very act of thinking that statement \u2013 the cognitive\nperformance \u2013 is existentially incoherent: I cannot\nboth think the statement and believe it to be true. Hintikka\ntakes the emphasis on \u201ccogito\u201d as intended \u201cto\nexpress the performatory character of Descartes\u2019s insight; it\nrefers to the \u2018performance\u2019 (to the act of thinking)\nthrough which the sentence \u2018I exist\u2019 may be said to verify\nitself\u201d (1962, 17).\n\nThe following Second Replies text can seem supportive of a\nnon-inferential reading:\n\nWhen someone says \u201cI am thinking, therefore I am, or I\nexist,\u201d he does not deduce existence from thought by means of a\nsyllogism, but recognizes it as something self-evident by a simple\nintuition of the mind. (Replies 2, AT 7:140, CSM 2:100)\n\n\nHowever, as Margaret Wilson correctly observes, \u201cthe claim that\nthe cogito is an inference \u2026 is not equivalent to\nthe claim that it is a syllogism\u201d (1978, 56). The passage only\nexpressly rejects the effort to understand the cogito in\nterms of syllogism, but not necessarily in terms of inference.\n\nFurther, it should be noted that inferential interpretations need not\nreject that the cogito counts also as an intuition.\nThere\u2019s no inconsistency in claiming a self-evident grasp of a\nproposition that has inferential structure. It is indeed widely held\namong philosophers that modus ponens is self-evident, yet it\ncontains an inference. In short, that a statement contains an\ninference does not entail that one\u2019s acceptance of it is\ngrounded in inference \u2013 a fact applicable to the\ncogito. Edwin Curley helpfully notes that Descartes\n\u201cconsistently blurs the distinction between inferences and\npropositions by referring to the whole formula \u2018I think,\ntherefore I am\u2019 as a truth, a first principle, a proposition,\nand a conclusion\u201d (1978, 79). Anthony Kenny adds that, for \nDescartes, \u201cwhat is from one point of view intuited is from \nanother point of view deduced\u201d (1968, 55), citing\nRules 3 as support.\n\nA related point concerns the absence of an express\n\u2018ergo\u2019 (\u2018therefore\u2019) in the Second\nMeditation account \u2013 as if thereby indicating the absence of \ninference in that passage. However, the Second Meditation passage\nis arguably the one place (of his various published treatments)\nwhere Descartes explicitly details a line of inferential \nreflection leading up to the conclusion that I am, I \nexist. His other treatments merely say the \n\u2018therefore\u2019; the Second Meditation unpacks it.\n\nWhatever the cogito\u2019s inferential status, it is\nworth noting a twofold observation of Barry Stroud: \u201ca\nthinker obviously could never be wrong in thinking \u2018I\nthink\u2019,\u201d moreover, \u201cno one who thinks could\nthink falsely that he exists\u201d (2008, 518).\n\nFurther issues about the cogito are worth clarifying\n\u2013 let\u2019s cover a few points in summary fashion. First,\na first-person formulation is essential to the certainty of the\ncogito. Third-person claims, such as \u201cIcarus\nthinks,\u201d or \u201cDescartes thinks,\u201d are not unshakably\ncertain \u2013 not for me, at any rate; only the occurrence\nof my thought has a chance of resisting hyperbolic doubt.\nThere are a number of passages in which Descartes refers to a\nthird-person version of the cogito. But none of these occurs\nin the context of establishing the actual existence of a particular\nthinker (in contrast with affirming the conditional, general result \nthat whatever thinks exists).\n\nSecond, a present tense formulation is essential to the certainty of\nthe cogito. It\u2019s no good to reason that \u201cI\nexisted last Tuesday, since I recall that I was thinking on that\nday.\u201d For all I know, I\u2019m now merely dreaming about that\noccasion. Nor does it work to reason that \u201cI\u2019ll continue\nto exist, since I\u2019m now thinking.\u201d As the meditator\nremarks, \u201cit could be that were I totally to cease from\nthinking, I should totally cease to exist\u201d (Med. 2, AT 7:27, CSM\n2:18). The privileged certainty of the cogito is grounded in\nthe \u201cmanifest contradiction\u201d (AT 7:36, CSM 2:25) of trying\nto think away my present thinking.\n\nThird, the certainty of the cogito depends on being\nformulated in terms of cogitatio \u2013 i.e., my thinking,\nor awareness/consciousness more generally. Any mode of thinking is\nsufficient, including doubting, affirming, denying, willing,\nunderstanding, imagining, and so on (cf. Med. 2, AT 7:28). My\nbodily activities, however, are insufficient. For instance,\nit\u2019s no good to reason that \u201cI exist, since I am\nwalking,\u201d because methodical doubt calls into question the\nexistence of my legs. Maybe I\u2019m just dreaming that I have legs.\nA simple revision, such as \u201cI exist, since it seems\nI\u2019m walking,\u201d restores the anti-sceptical potency (cf.\nReplies 5, AT 7:352; Prin. 1:9).\n\nFourth, a caveat is in order. That Descartes rejects formulations\npresupposing the existence of a body commits him to no more than an\nepistemic distinction between the ideas of mind and body, but not\n(yet) an ontological distinction (as in mind-body dualism). Indeed, in\nthe passage following the cogito, Descartes has his meditator\nsay: \n\nAnd yet may it not perhaps be the case that these very things which I\nam supposing to be nothing [e.g., \u201cthat structure of limbs which\nis called a human body\u201d], because they are unknown to me, are in\nreality identical with the \u201cI\u201d of which I am aware? I do\nnot know, and for the moment I shall not argue the point, since I can\nmake judgements only about things which are known to me. (Med. 2, AT\n7:27, CSM 2:18)\n\n\nIn short, the intended epistemic success of the cogito does\nnot presuppose any particular mind-body ontology.\n\nFinally, Descartes\u2019 reference to an \u201cI\u201d, in the\n\u201cI think,\u201d is not intended to presuppose the existence of\na substantial self. In the very next sentence following the\ninitial statement of the cogito, the meditator says:\n\u201cBut I do not yet have a sufficient understanding of what this\n\u2018I\u2019 is, that now necessarily exists\u201d (AT 7:25, CSM\n2:17). As Stephen Menn writes:\n\nAlthough the Meditator now knows that he is, he does not seem\nto know what he is: his old conception of his nature has been\ncalled into doubt, and he does not seem to have anything new to\nreplace it. (1998, 249)\n\n\nThe cogito purports to yield certainty that I exist\ninsofar as I am a thinking thing, whatever that turns out\nto be. The ensuing discussion is intended to help arrive at an\nunderstanding of the ontological nature of the thinking subject.\n\nMore generally, we should distinguish issues of epistemic and\nontological dependence. In the final analysis, Descartes thinks he\nshows that the occurrence of thought depends (ontologically) on the\nexistence of a substantial self \u2013 to wit, on the existence of an\ninfinite substance, namely God (cf. Med. 3, AT 7:48ff). But he denies\nthat an acceptance of these ontological matters is epistemically prior\nto the cogito: its certainty is not supposed to depend\n(epistemically) on the abstruse metaphysics that Descartes thinks he\neventually establishes. (See Vinci 1998 for an alternative\nreading.)\n\nIf the cogito does not presuppose a substantial self, what\nthen is the epistemic basis for injecting the \u2018I\u2019 into the\n\u201cI think\u201d? Some critics have complained that, in referring\nto the \u201cI\u201d, Descartes begs the question by presupposing\nwhat he means to establish in the \u201cI exist.\u201d Among the\ncritics, Bertrand Russell objects that \u201cthe word \u2018I\u2019\nis really illegitimate.\u201d Echoing the 18th century thinker, Georg\nLichtenberg, Russell writes that Descartes should have, instead,\nstated \u201chis ultimate premiss in the form \u2018there are\nthoughts\u2019.\u201d Russell adds that \u201cthe word\n\u2018I\u2019 is grammatically convenient, but does not describe a\ndatum\u201d (1945, 567). Accordingly, \u201cthere is pain\u201d and\n\u201cI am in pain\u201d have different contents, and Descartes is\nentitled only to the former.\n\nOne effort at reply has it that introspection reveals more than what\nRussell allows \u2013 it reveals the subjective character of\nexperience. On this view, there is more to the experiential story of\nbeing in pain than is expressed by saying that there is\npain: the experience includes the feeling of pain plus a\npoint-of-view \u2013 an experiential addition that\u2019s\ndifficult to characterize except by adding that \u201cI\u201d am in\npain, that the pain is mine. Importantly, my awareness of\nthis subjective feature of experience does not depend on an awareness\nof the metaphysical nature of a thinking subject. If we take Descartes\nto be using \u2018I\u2019 to signify this subjective character, then\nhe is not smuggling in something that\u2019s not already there: the\n\u201cI\u201d-ness of consciousness turns out to be (contra Russell)\na primary datum of experience. And though, as Hume persuasively\nargues, introspection reveals no sense impressions suited\nto the role of a thinking subject, Descartes, unlike Hume, has no\nneed to derive all our ideas from sense impressions. Descartes\u2019 \nidea of the self does ultimately draw on innate conceptual \nresources.\n\nSetting aside the philosophical concerns associated with the\ncogito, let\u2019s turn to a further interpretive\nconcern: namely, the issue of whether, at its initial introduction\n(in the Second Meditation), Descartes intends that the\ncogito counts as perfect knowledge.\n4.2 Does the Cogito count as (Atheist-Available) Perfect Knowledge?\n\nThe extraordinary certainty and doubt-resistance of the\ncogito marks an Archimedean turning point in the\nmeditator\u2019s inquiry. However, there are interpretive disputes\nabout whether Descartes intends the cogito to count \u2013\nat its initial introduction, prior to the arguments for God \u2013 as\nfully indubitable, and therefore as perfect knowledge. It is\nquite common to interpret the cogito as being the first item\nof perfect knowledge. In\n Section 6.1\n we\u2019ll explore how such interpretations (i.e., Bounded Doubt\nInterpretations) render Descartes\u2019 broader argument. But here,\nI want to develop the textual case for holding that even the \ncogito is undermined by Evil Genius Doubt.\n\nThere is no disputing that Descartes characterizes the cogito\nas the \u201cfirst item of knowledge [cognitione]\u201d\n(Med. 3, AT 7:35, CSM 2:24), and as the first \u201cpiece of\nknowledge [cognitio]\u201d (Prin. 1:7, AT 8a:7, CSM\n1:195). Noteworthy, however, is the Latin terminology Descartes uses\nin these characterizations (\u2018cognitio\u2019 and its\ncognates). As noted at the outset, Descartes is a contextualist in the\nsense of invoking the notion of knowledge in divergent\ncontexts that presuppose very different epistemic standards. Of\nparticular interest is that he expressly clarifies that contexts aptly\ncharacterized in terms of cognitio-talk do not necessarily\ncount as perfect knowledge:\n\nThe fact that an atheist can be \u201cclearly aware [clare\ncognoscere] that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two\nright angles\u201d is something I do not dispute. But I maintain that\nthis awareness [cognitionem] of his is not true knowledge\n[scientiam], since no act of awareness [cognitio]\nthat can be rendered doubtful seems fit to be called knowledge\n[scientia]. Now since we are supposing that this individual\nis an atheist, he cannot be certain that he is not being deceived on\nmatters which seem to him to be very evident (as I fully explained).\n(Replies 2, AT 7:141, CSM 2:101)\n\n\nThis alone does not prove that the cogito is not intended\nto count as perfect knowledge (at its initial occurrence, in the\nSecond Meditation). However, it does undercut the argument\nwhereby calling it the \u201cfirst item of knowledge\u201d\nshows that Descartes intends it as perfect knowledge.\n\nMore generally, a wide range of clear texts support (what I\u2019ll\ncall) the No Atheistic Perfect Knowledge Thesis \u2013 a thesis with\nimplications for the debate about the cogito. Consider the\nfollowing texts, each arising in a context of clarifying the\nrequirements of perfect knowledge (italics are added):\n\n\nFor if I do not know this [i.e., \u201cwhether there is a God, and,\nif there is, whether he can be a deceiver\u201d], it seems that I can\nnever be quite certain about anything else. (Med. 3, AT 7:36,\nCSM 2:25)\n\nI see that the certainty of all other things depends on this\n[i.e., \u201cthat the supreme being exists\u201d], so that without\nit nothing can ever be perfectly known [perfecte\nsciri]. (Med. 5, AT 7:69, CSM 2:48)\n\n[I]f I were unaware of God \u2026 I should thus never have true and\ncertain knowledge [scientiam] about anything, but\nonly shifting and changeable opinions. (Med. 5, AT 7:69, CSM 2:48)\n\nThus I see plainly that the certainty and truth of all\nknowledge [scientiae] depends uniquely on my awareness of the\ntrue God, to such an extent that I was incapable of perfect knowledge\n[perfecte scire] about anything else until I became\naware of him. (Med. 5, AT 7:71, CSM 2:49)\n\n\nThese texts make a powerful case that nothing else can be\nperfectly known prior to establishing that we\u2019re\ncreated by an all-perfect God, rather than an evil genius. Indeed,\nDescartes\u2019 express wording seems intended to rule-out any \nexceptions. The first text is particularly noteworthy, because it\ncomes at the end of a paragraph which includes reference to the \ncogito. As Curley writes:\n\nNotice that Descartes does not say: until I know whether God\nexists and can be a deceiver I cannot be certain of anything\nexcept the existence of the self and its thoughts. He says he\ncannot be certain of anything. (2006, 40)\n\n\nDescartes looks to hold that hyperbolic doubt is utterly unbounded\n\u2013 i.e., that it undermines all manner of propositions,\nincluding thereby the proposition that \u201cI exist.\u201d\n\nWe can indeed read the opening paragraphs of the Third Meditation as\nintended to clarify not that the cogito is perfectly known,\nbut instead the following twofold point: First, that what underwrites\nthe cogito\u2019s epistemic impressiveness is\nclarity and distinctness. Second, that even\ncognitions this impressive can be undermined by Evil Genius Doubt, and\nthus lack the full indubitability of perfect knowledge.\n\nRegarding the first point, the Third Meditation opens with meditator\nattempting to build on the apparent success of the cogito.\nWhat are the internal marks of this impressive perception \u2013\nwhat is it like to have perception that good? The answer:\n\nI am certain that I am a thinking thing. Do I not therefore also know\nwhat is required for my being certain about anything? In this first\nitem of knowledge [cognitione] there is simply a clear and\ndistinct perception of what I am asserting. (AT 7:35, CSM 2:24)\n\n\nThe next two paragraphs help clarify (among other things) what\nDescartes takes to be epistemically impressive about clear and\ndistinct perception, in contrast with external sense perception.\nOf external sensation, the third paragraph offers this:\n\nYet I previously accepted as wholly certain and evident many things\nwhich I afterwards realized were doubtful. What were these? The earth,\nsky, stars, and everything else that I apprehended with the senses.\nBut what was it about them that I perceived clearly? Just that the\nideas, or thoughts, of such things appeared before my mind. Yet even\nnow I am not denying that these ideas occur within me. \u2026 Here\nwas my mistake; or at any rate, if my judgement was true, it was not\nthanks to the strength of my perception. (AT 7:35, CSM 2:24f)\n\n\nThough we regularly form judgments based on external sensation, they\nare easily undermined by sceptical doubt, as shown by the Now Dreaming\nDoubt. By contrast, our clear and distinct perceptions enjoy a\nperceptual \u201cstrength\u201d enabling us to ward off even the\nEvil Genius Doubt (at least, so it might seem). The fourth paragraph\noffers this:\n\nBut what about when I was considering something very simple and\nstraightforward in arithmetic or geometry, for example that two and\nthree added together make five, and so on? Did I not see at least\nthese things clearly enough to affirm their truth? \u2026 when I\nturn to the things themselves which I think I perceive very clearly, I\nam so convinced by them that I spontaneously declare: let whoever can\ndo so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so\nlong as I continue to think I am something \u2026 or bring it about\nthat two and three added together are more or less than five, or\nanything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction. (AT\n7:36, CSM 2:25)\n\n\nPrima facie, this excerpt suggests that multiple propositions are\n\u2013 at this pre-theistic stage of the broader argument \u2013\nfully indubitable, thereby counting as perfect knowledge. But there\nis more to the paragraph; which brings us to the second point noted \nabove, namely, that even cognitions this impressive can be undermined \nby Evil Genius Doubt \u2013 an outcome clarified in the final lines\nof this same paragraph:\n\nFor if I do not know this [i.e., \u201cwhether there is a God, and,\nif there is, whether he can be a deceiver\u201d], it seems that I can\nnever be quite certain about anything else.\n\n\nIn order to appreciate the subtleties of this pivotal fourth paragraph\nof the Third Meditation, we need to clarify the indirect\nmanner in which Evil Genius Doubt operates on clear and distinct\nperception.\n4.3 How Indirectly to Doubt Clear and Distinct Perception\n\nHow could a doubt undermine the cogito? Part of its\nimpressiveness is that I cannot think about my existence without\naffirming it, yet I cannot doubt my existence without thinking about\nit. In short, I simply cannot doubt the proposition \u201cI\nexist\u201d \u2013 or so it appears.\n\nSeeming to reinforce further the suspicion that the cogito\ncannot be doubted is a more general thesis Descartes holds concerning\nthe doubt-resistance of any matters that are clearly and\ndistinctly perceived:\n\n\n[T]he nature of my mind is such that I cannot but assent to these\nthings, at least so long as I clearly perceive them. (Med. 5, AT 7:65,\nCSM 2:45)\n\n[M]y nature is such that so long as I perceive something very clearly\nand distinctly I cannot but believe it to be true. (Med. 5, AT 7:69,\nCSM 2:48)\n\n\nHow, then, is it possible to doubt such matters? According to one\ninterpretation, the answer is that we cannot doubt them\ndirectly, however, we can doubt them in an indirect\nmanner. That is, rather than directing the doubt at particular such\npropositions, as that I exist, or that 2+3=5, the doubt is\ninstead directed at the cognitive faculties by which we\napprehend such propositions. By way of analogy, consider that if a\ncalculator were defective, it would cast doubt on any calculations it\ngenerated. Likewise, if my own mind were in some sense defective, this\nwould cast doubt on any matters I apprehended \u2013 no matter how\nevident those matters might seem. By directing the doubt at the\nveracity of my own cognitive faculties, I do thereby\nindirectly doubt the particular propositions apprehended by\nmeans of those faculties.\n\nA wealth of texts support that this is how the Evil Genius Doubt is\nintended to operate. Consider these (italics are added):\n\n\n[Perhaps some God could have given me a nature such that I was\ndeceived even in matters which seemed most evident.\n(Med. 3, AT 7:36, CSM 2:25)\n\nI can convince myself that I have a natural disposition to go\nwrong from time to time in matters which I think I perceive\nas evidently as can be. (Med. 5, AT 7:70, CSM 2:48)\n\nI saw nothing to rule out the possibility that my natural\nconstitution made me prone to error even in matters which\nseemed to me most true. (Med. 6, AT 7:77, CSM 2:53)\n\n[T]he most serious doubt [arises] from our ignorance about whether our\nnature might not be such as to make us go wrong even in\nmatters which seemed to us utterly evident. (Prin.\n1:30; AT 8a:16, CSM 1:203)\n\n\nAs each passage conveys, the doubt is directed not at the particular\nobject level propositions undermined, but at the possibility of our\nhaving a defective cognitive nature. (In this vein, Carriero helpfully\nrefers to the doubt under the heading, \u2018imperfect-nature\ndoubt\u2019 [2009, 27], rather than Evil Genius Doubt; Newman and\nNelson refer to it as \u2018meta-cognitive doubt\u2019 [1999, 374].)\nAs each passage also conveys, the doubt effectively undermines even\nthe \u201cmost evident\u201d of matters. Because the doubt is\nindirect, it\u2019s blind to the particular propositions it\nundercuts. The relevant question does arguably shift from,\n\u201cHow could a doubt undermine\nthe cogito?\u201d, to \u201cHow could this doubt\nfail to undermine even the cogito?\u201d\nIndeed, the first of the above passages expressly includes the\ncogito with the list of example propositions being\nindirectly called into doubt \u2013 this, in the pivotal fourth \nparagraph of the Third Meditation:\n\nBut what about when I was considering something very simple and\nstraightforward in arithmetic or geometry, for example that two and\nthree added together make five, and so on? Did I not see at least\nthese things clearly enough to affirm their truth? Indeed, the only\nreason for my later judgement that they were open to doubt\nwas that it occurred to me that perhaps some God could have given me a\nnature such that I was deceived even in matters which seemed most\nevident. And whenever my preconceived belief in the supreme power of\nGod comes to mind, I cannot but admit that it would be easy for him,\nif he so desired, to bring it about that I go wrong even in those\nmatters which I think I see utterly clearly with my mind\u2019s eye.\nYet when I turn to the things themselves which I think I\nperceive very clearly, I am so convinced by them that I spontaneously\ndeclare: let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it\nabout that I am nothing, so long as I continue to think I am\nsomething; or make it true at some future time that I have never\nexisted, since it is now true that I exist; or bring it about that two\nand three added together are more or less than five, or anything of\nthis kind in which I see a manifest contradiction. (AT 7:35f, CSM\n2:25; italics added)\n\n\nThe suggestion is of an epistemic schizophrenia, of sorts, depending\non whether one\u2019s attention is directed at the object level\npropositions, or instead at the possibility of our having defective\ncognitive faculties:\n\n\nMoments of epistemic optimism: While I am directly attending\nto a proposition, perceiving it clearly and distinctly, I enjoy an\nirresistible cognitive luminance and my assent is compelled.\n\nMoments of epistemic pessimism: When no longer directly\nattending \u2013 no longer perceiving the proposition clearly and\ndistinctly \u2013 I can entertain the sceptical hypothesis that such\nfeelings of cognitive luminance are epistemically worthless, indeed\narising from a defective cognitive nature.\n\n\nGranted, this indirect doubt is exceedingly hyperbolic. Even so, it\nentails that we lack the full indubitability requisite to\nperfect knowledge. Descartes thus closes the pivotal fourth paragraph,\nclarifying that because of the Evil Genius Doubt, nothing\n(yet) meets the epistemic standard of perfect knowledge:\n\nAnd since I have no cause to think that there is a deceiving God, and\nI do not yet even know for sure whether there is a God at all, any\nreason for doubt which depends simply on this supposition is a very\nslight and, so to speak, metaphysical one. But in order to remove even\nthis slight reason for doubt, as soon as the opportunity arises I must\nexamine whether there is a God, and, if there is, whether he can be a\ndeceiver. For if I do not know this, it seems that I can never be\nquite certain about anything else. (AT 7:36, CSM 2:25)\n\n\nA later Third Meditation passage \u2013 but one occurring prior to\nthe arguments for God \u2013 can be taken to suggest a very different\ninterpretation. On this alternative account, some of the matters we\nclearly and distinctly perceive are fully indubitable,\nthereby counting as perfect knowledge even prior to knowledge of God.\nThe passage has Descartes drawing a distinction between what is\nrevealed by the natural light, and what is taught by\nnature:\n\nWhen I say \u201cNature taught me to think this,\u201d all I mean is\nthat a spontaneous impulse leads me to believe it, not that its truth\nhas been revealed to me by some natural light. There is a big\ndifference here. Whatever is revealed to me by the natural light\n\u2013 for example that from the fact that I am doubting it follows\nthat I exist, and so on \u2013 cannot in any way be open to doubt.\nThis is because there cannot be another faculty both as trustworthy as\nthe natural light and also capable of showing me that such things are\nnot true. But as for my natural impulses, I have often judged in the\npast that they were pushing me in the wrong direction when it was a\nquestion of choosing the good, and I do not see why I should place any\ngreater confidence in them in other matters. (AT 7:38f, CSM 2:26f)\n\n\nThe passage makes clear that the cogito is revealed by\nthe natural light; and on one plausible reading, it conveys that\nthe cogito is utterly immune to doubt \u2013 i.e., it \n\u201ccannot in any way be open to doubt.\u201d On this\nunderstanding, the scope of Evil Genius Doubt is bounded,\nin the sense that not all propositions are vulnerable to the doubt. \nThis is to say that some propositions, including the cogito, \nmay be fully indubitable, thus satisfying the requirements of\nperfect knowledge \u2013 even for atheists.\n\nDefenders of an unbounded doubt interpretation would offer\na different analysis of the passage. First, we saw that Descartes\nearlier claimed that what grounds the extraordinary certainty of the\ncogito is that \u201cthere is simply a clear and distinct\nperception.\u201d Yet, that earlier claim is surprising, if the point\nof the above passage is that the natural light is\nepistemically superior to mere garden variety clarity and\ndistinctness. A remark Descartes makes to Hobbes is relevant:\n\u201cAs everyone knows, a \u2018light in the intellect\u2019 means\ntransparent clarity of cognition\u201d (Replies 3, AT 7:192, CSM\n2:135). This suggests that \u201cnatural light\u201d references are\nsimply another way of talking about clear and distinct perception. On\nthis point, Carriero notes: \u201cI do not see an important\ndistinction for Descartes between something\u2019s being revealed to\nme by the light of nature and my perceiving clearly that thing\u2019s\nbeing the case\u201d (2008, 305). Note further that a bounded doubt\ninterpretation of this passage is at odds with the numerous other\npassages we\u2019ve examined indicating that even the cogito\nis vulnerable to the Evil Genius Doubt.\n\nHow, then, do unbounded doubt interpreters deal with this passage?\nIn context, the point of the natural light passage is not to draw\na distinction between two grades of clear and distinct perception;\nit\u2019s instead to clarify the distinction between the kind of\nprobabilistic reasoning the meditator had invoked in prior remarks,\nand the irresistible evidentness accompanying our very best\ncognitions, such as the cogito. We can indeed take the point\nof the passage to apply to moments of careful attention: even while\ndirectly attending to the probabilistic matters (taught by nature), we\nrecognize that there are grounds for doubt; whereas, when directly\nattending to our epistemically best cognitions (revealed by the\nnatural light), we simply cannot doubt them. This reading renders the\npassage continuous with our reading of the other passages. Again, in\nthe pivotal fourth paragraph of the Third Meditation: \u201cwhen I\nturn to the things themselves which I think I perceive very clearly,\nI am so convinced by them that I spontaneously declare: let whoever\ncan do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, \nso long as I continue to think I am something\u201d; i.e.,\nwhile directly attending to them, the matters revealed by the\nnatural light \u201ccannot in any way be open to doubt.\u201d And\nyet, upon diverting attention, they fall prey to the Evil Genius\nDoubt.\n\n(For further discussion of the cogito, see Beyssade 1993, \nBroughton 2002, Carriero 2009, Cunning 2007, Curley 1978, \nFrankfurt 1966, Hintikka 1962, Kenny 1968, Markie 1992, \nPeacocke 2012, Sarkar 2003, Stroud 2008, Vendler 1984,\nVinci 1998, Williams 1978, and Wilson 1978.)\n5. C&D Rule and the Road to Perfect Knowledge\n5.1 Clarity and Distinctness as a Provisional Truth Rule\n\nRecall that Descartes characterizes the cogito as an\nArchimedean point, of sorts, in his constructive efforts at finding\nsomething \u201ccertain and unshakeable.\u201d It is clear how the\ncogito serves this role on bounded doubt interpretations,\nsince they render it as being fully immune to the Evil Genius Doubt\n\u2013 indeed, as providing the initial item of perfect knowledge.\nBut what about unbounded doubt interpretations: in rendering\nthe cogito as being subject to Evil Genius Doubt, how do they\nexplain its Archimedean role in the broader project? One answer is\nthat insofar as the cogito is the first cognition noticed to\nresist any efforts at a direct doubt, it can be said to play\nan Archimedean role. For it exemplifies the kind of cognitions the\nmeditator thereafter employs, in all subsequent constructive efforts\nto overcome the sceptical problem.\n\nDescartes indeed uses the cogito to clarify the epistemically\nprivileged status of clear and distinct perception, even formulating\nclarity and distinctness as underwriting a general rule for\ndiscovering truth. The passage occurs in the second paragraph of the\nThird Meditation:\n\nIn this first item of knowledge there is simply a clear and distinct\nperception of what I am asserting; this would not be enough to make me\ncertain of the truth of the matter if it could ever turn out that\nsomething which I perceived with such clarity and distinctness was\nfalse. So I now seem [videor] to be able to lay it down as a\ngeneral rule that whatever I perceive very clearly and distinctly is\ntrue. (AT 7:35, CSM 2:24)\n\n\nI shall refer to this general rule the \u2018C&D Rule\u2019.\nThough interpretations differ, the context of the passage indicates\nthe rule is treated as provisional \u2013 i.e., further work\nwill be needed before the rule can be regarded as finally established.\nOn two counts, the announcement of the rule is carefully tinged with\ncaution, in anticipation of the revelation to come (two paragraphs\nlater) that even clearly and distinctly perceived matters are\nvulnerable to the Evil Genius Doubt. First, the passage notes that\nbeing clearly and distinctly perceived \u201cwould not be enough to\nmake me certain of the truth of the matter,\u201d if the truth of\nsuch matters could be undermined. Second, the announcement includes an\nimportant qualification, in saying that it does \u201cnow seem\u201d\n(videor) that this is a justified rule. Because it soon\nemerges that the Evil Genius Doubt undermines the veracity of the\nC&D Rule, Descartes assumes the burden of trying to establish \nthe rule \u2013 a proof he takes to occur not in this early Third\nMeditation passage, but only later, after having argued for an\nall-perfect God: Descartes writes that it is \u201cin the Fourth \nMeditation [that] it is proved that everything that we clearly and \ndistinctly perceive is true\u201d (Synopsis, AT 7:15, CSM 2:11).\n (Section 5.3\n discusses Descartes\u2019 Fourth Meditation argument for the C&D\nRule.)\n5.2 Strategy for Constructive Proofs \nMoving Forward\n\nIf even clear and distinct perception is subject to doubt, how is\nthe meditator to make progress? How can he construct arguments in\nthe effort to solve the sceptical problem? This brings into focus\nthe issue of whether Descartes\u2019 procedure is viciously\ncircular. For it seems that in the very process of\narguing for a truth rule, he is already employing that \nvery rule. For now, we\u2019ll set to the side the issue of \ncircularity (returning to it in\n Section 6).\n\nIn his strategy for making constructive arguments, Descartes builds on\nthe fact that clearly and distinctly perceived matters appear to us to\nbe utterly conclusive, i.e., while our perception is clear and\ndistinct. So, by employing none other than premises and reasoning that\nare clearly and distinctly perceived, we can \u2013 in some sense\n\u2013 make rational progress, notwithstanding that those very same \nproofs fall vulnerable to indirect doubt, once our attention is no \nlonger clear and distinct. The following Fifth Meditation passage illustrates the point:\n\nAdmittedly my nature is such that so long as I perceive something very\nclearly and distinctly I cannot but believe it to be true. But my\nnature is also such that I cannot fix my mental vision continually on\nthe same thing, so as to keep perceiving it clearly; and often the\nmemory of a previously made judgement may come back, when I am no\nlonger attending to the arguments which led me to make it. And so\nother arguments can now occur to me which might easily undermine my\nopinion, if I were unaware of [the true] God; and I should thus never\nhave true and certain knowledge about anything, but only shifting and\nchangeable opinions. For example, when I consider the nature of a\ntriangle, it appears most evident to me, steeped as I am in the\nprinciples of geometry, that its three angles are equal to two right\nangles; and so long as I attend to the proof, I cannot but believe\nthis to be true. But as soon as I turn my mind\u2019s eye away from\nthe proof, then in spite of still remembering that I perceived it very\nclearly, I can easily fall into doubt about its truth, if I am unaware\nof God. For I can convince myself that I have a natural disposition to\ngo wrong from time to time in matters which I think I perceive as\nevidently as can be. (Med. 5, AT 7:69f, CSM 2:48; cf. AT 3:64f; AT\n8a:9f).\n\n\nOf course, Descartes will need some sort of final solution to the\nproblem of ongoing indirect doubt. In the meantime, he has his\nmeditator attempting to move forward, by constructing clearly and\ndistinctly perceived anti-sceptical arguments.\n\nThe broader argumentative strategy is revealed at the end of the\npivotal fourth paragraph of the Third Meditation: \u201cin order to\nremove even this slight reason for doubt, as soon as the opportunity\narises I must examine whether there is a God, and, if there is,\nwhether he can be a deceiver.\u201d So, in the effort to establish\nthe C&D Rule, the meditator makes arguments to the conclusion that\nhis creator is not an evil genius, but an all-perfect creator who\nwould not allow him to be deceived about what he clearly and\ndistinctly perceives.\n\nThe broader argument encompasses two main steps. The first main\nstep involves Third Meditation arguments for the existence of an\nall-perfect God. From these arguments the meditator concludes:\n\nI recognize that it would be impossible for me to exist with the\nkind of nature I have \u2013 that is, having within me the idea\nof God \u2013 were it not the case that God really existed. By\n\u2018God\u2019 I mean the very being the idea of whom is within me,\nthat is, the possessor of all the perfections which I cannot grasp,\nbut can somehow reach in my thought, who is subject to no defects\nwhatsoever. It is clear enough from this that he cannot be a deceiver,\nsince it is manifest by the natural light that all fraud and deception\ndepend on some defect. (Med. 3, AT 7:51f, CSM 2:35)\n\n\nThere is much of interest in Descartes\u2019 Third Meditation\narguments for an all-perfect creator God. (Note that the Fifth\nMeditation advances a further argument for God.) In the interests\nof space, and of focusing on epistemological concerns, however,\nthese arguments will not be considered here. (For an overview of\nDescartes\u2019 proofs, see Nolan 2014 and Nolan & Nelson\n2006.)\n\nThe second main step involves an argument from the premise (now\nestablished) that an all-perfect God exists, to the general veracity\nof the C&D Rule \u2013 whereby, whatever is clearly and\ndistinctly perceived is guaranteed to be true. It is this second\nmain step of the broader argument to which we now turn. (As will\nemerge, a yet further, third step is required on some\ninterpretations.)\n5.3 Fourth Meditation Proof of the C&D Rule\n\nIt might seem that a separate argument for the C&D Rule is\nunneeded \u2013 that having demonstrated a non-deceiving God, the\nveracity of the rule is a straightforward consequence. But this is too\nfast. Why should only the C&D Rule be a straightforward\nconsequence, but not also a more general infallibility of all\nour judgments? Essentially this point is made in the First Meditation,\nat the introduction of the Evil Genius Doubt. As we saw, the meditator\nthere observes that what seems to follow from the standard view\n\u2013 whereby God \u201cis said to be supremely good,\u201d rather\nthan a deceiver \u2013 is that God would not allow us ever\nto be mistaken in our judgments:\n\nBut if it were inconsistent with his goodness to have created me such\nthat I am deceived all the time, it would seem equally foreign to his\ngoodness to allow me to be deceived even occasionally; yet this last\nassertion cannot be made. (Med. 1, AT 7:21, CSM 2:14)\n\n\nIn short, the most straightforward consequence of an all-perfect\ncreator would seem to be the universal rule: If I form a judgment,\nthen it is true. Yet quite clearly, this rule\ndoesn\u2019t hold. What emerges is an instance of the problem of\nevil, here applied to judgment error. As the passage reasons:\n\nJudgment error occurs.\nThat judgment error occurs is incompatible with the hypothesis\nthat I am the creation of an all-perfect God.\nTherefore, I am not the creation of an all-perfect God.\n\n\nThese First Meditation remarks set the stage for the discussion\nthat comes in the Fourth Meditation. Descartes needs a theodicy\nfor error \u2013 theodicy being an effort to explain how\nan all-perfect God is compatible with evil. The theodicy needs to\nshow that the existence of such a God is compatible with some forms\nof judgment error, but not others; somehow, God allows error in our \nsensory judgments, while guaranteeing the inerrancy of judgments\nbased on clear and distinct perception. In contrast with the First \nMeditation setting, the context of the Fourth Meditation comes on\nthe heels of a demonstration of the existence of an all-perfect\nGod. The argument of the Fourth Meditation thus begins by reviewing\nthe problem where the First Meditation left it, but in the light of\nthe meditator\u2019s newfound conclusion \u2013 \u201cto begin\nwith, I recognize that it is impossible that God should ever deceive \nme.\u201d The passage continues:\n\nNext, I know by experience that there is in me a\nfaculty of judgement which, like everything else which is in me, I\ncertainly received from God. And since God does not wish to deceive\nme, he surely did not give me the kind of faculty which would ever\nenable me to go wrong while using it correctly.\nThere would be no further doubt on this issue\nwere it not that what I have just said appears to imply that I am\nincapable of ever going wrong. For if everything that is in me comes\nfrom God, and he did not endow me with a faculty for making mistakes,\nit appears that I can never go wrong. (Med. 4, AT 7:53f, CSM 2:37f)\n\n\nSeeking to resolve the problem, the meditator investigates the\ncauses of error. In the course of the discussion, Descartes puts \nforward his theory whereby judgment arises from the cooperation\nof the intellect and the will: the role of the \nintellect is to consider a perceptual content \u2013 i.e.,\nsomething seeming to be the case, thereby functioning as a\npossible judgment; the role of the will is to give assent (or\ndissent), or withhold assent, to the perceptual content under \nconsideration.\n\nThe investigation concludes that the blameworthy cause of error\nlies in our improper use of our free will. Neither the intellect\nnor the will is inherently defective (though each is, of course,\nfinite), nor is there inherent defect in the design of how they \ncooperate \u2013 i.e., their design does not render error\ninevitable. The design does make for the possibility of error,\nin that \u201cthe scope of the will is wider than that of the \nintellect\u201d: my will is able to assent to further matters\nthan just those that I clearly and distinctly understand; \u201cbut \ninstead of restricting it within the same limits, I extend its use\nto matters which I do not understand\u201d (AT 7:58, CSM 2:40).\nIn short, actual mistakes of judgment arise from user error:\n\n[If] I simply refrain from making a judgement in cases where I do not\nperceive the truth with sufficient clarity and distinctness, then it\nis clear that I am behaving correctly and avoiding error. But if in\nsuch cases I either affirm or deny, then I am not using my free will\ncorrectly. (Med. 4, AT 7:59, CSM 2:41)\n\n\nThe theodicy that emerges is a version of the free will defense.\nAccordingly, we should thank God for giving us free will, but the cost\nof having free will is the possibility of misusing it. Since error is\nthe result of misusing our free will, we should not blame God.\n\nNot only is the theodicy used to explain the kinds of error God\ncan allow, it serves to clarify the kinds of error God\ncannot allow. From the latter arises a proof of the C&D\nRule. God can allow errors that are our fault, but not errors\nthat would be God\u2019s fault. On occasions when my\nperception is clear and distinct, my assent is involuntary and thus\nnot a result of a misuse of my free will. In such cases,\nassent is a necessary consequence of my cognitive nature \u2013 a\npoint made in many passages, as we\u2019ve seen: \u201cour mind is\nof such a nature that it cannot help assenting to what it clearly\nunderstands\u201d (AT 3:64, CSMK 147). Since, on occasions of clarity\nand distinctness, my assent is the unavoidable consequence of my\nGod-given cognitive nature, God would properly get the blame if those\njudgments resulted in error. Therefore, they are not in error; indeed\nthey could not be. That an evil genius might have created me\ncasts doubt on my clear and distinct judgments. That, instead, an\nall-perfect God created me guarantees that these judgments are true. A\nclever strategy of argument thus unfolds \u2013 effectively inverting\nthe usual reasoning in the problem of evil:\n\nI am the creation of an all-perfect God.\nThat I am the creation of an all-perfect God is incompatible with\nthe sceptical hypothesis that I am in error about what I clearly and\ndistinctly perceive.\nTherefore, I am not in error about what I clearly and distinctly\nperceive.\n\n\nThe first premise is argued in the Third Meditation. The second\npremise arises from the discussion of the Fourth Meditation. The\nresult is a divine guarantee of the C&D Rule. Whatever I perceive\nclearly and distinctly is guaranteed true, because I am the creature\nof an all-perfect God.\n\nIt might seem that, by the end of the Fourth Meditation, \nDescartes\u2019 broader case to overcome radical doubt is complete. \nAt that stage, the meditator is in position to reproduce a \ndemonstration \u2013 each step of which he clearly and distinctly \nperceives \u2013 which supports the grand conclusion that he\u2019s\nthe creation of an all-perfect God who would not allow him to be \nmistaken about whatever he perceives clearly and distinctly. However,\nthere are significant issues that must be addressed. Among the\nphilosophical concerns is that the demonstration itself looks \nsuspiciously circular \u2013 the so-called Cartesian Circle. A\nfurther issue arises in connection with the interpretation we\nhave been developing: for when the meditator is no longer clearly\nand distinctly perceiving the steps of the demonstration, the\ngrand conclusion can then be undermined by means of the Evil Genius\nDoubt; i.e., it would seem that perfect knowledge is not yet within\nthe meditator\u2019s grasp. Perhaps related is that at the close\nof the Fourth Meditation one finds no announcement of victory over\nthe Evil Genius Doubt; instead, the announcement comes at the end\nof the Fifth Meditation. But why? It is to such issues that we\nnow turn.\n\n6. Perfect Knowledge, Circularity, and Truth\n6.1 The Cartesian Circle\n\nStudents of philosophy can expect to be taught a longstanding\ninterpretation according to which Descartes\u2019 broader argument\nis viciously circular. He first argues from clearly and distinctly\nperceived premises to the conclusion that an all-perfect God exists;\nhe then argues from the premise that an all-perfect God exists to the\nconclusion that whatever is clearly and distinctly perceived is true.\nThe worry is that he presupposes the C&D Rule in the effort to\nprove the C&D Rule. Despite its prima facie plausibility,\nDescartes scholarship generally resists the vicious circularity\ninterpretation, based on numerous textual considerations. But even\nputting those texts to the side, it should be surprising that the\nproject would be viciously circular. As Thomas Lennon notes:\n\n[I]t would be nothing less than astonishing if the central argument\nof the central text of the central figure of the central period in\nthe history of philosophy were obviously circular. How could the\nfather of modern philosophy, the source of the epistemological turn, \nhave produced such an obviously loopy argument? (2008, 158)\n\n\nConsider first what every plausible interpretation must concede:\nthat the two main steps of the broader argument unfold in a manner\nsuggestive of a circle \u2013 let us indeed refer to them as\n\u2018arcs\u2019. The Third Meditation arguments for God define one\narc:\n\nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived.\n\n\nThe Fourth Meditation argument defines a second arc:\n\nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived (i.e., the C&D Rule) is derived\nfrom the conclusion that an all-perfect God exists.\n\n\nThat the broader argument unfolds in accord with these two steps is\nuncontroversial. The question of interest concerns whether, strictly\nspeaking, these arcs form an epistemic circle. The statement\nof Arc 1 admits of some ambiguity. How one resolves this ambiguity \ndetermines whether the arcs strictly form a circle. Let\u2019s begin \nby clarifying what Arc 1 would have to mean to generate vicious \ncircularity. We\u2019ll then consider the main alternative \ninterpretations of that arc by which commentators seek to avoid \ncircularity.\n\n\nVicious Circularity interpretation:\n\nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived\n\u2013 i.e., premises that are accepted only because of having\nfirst accepted the general veracity of propositions that are clearly\nand distinctly perceived.\n\nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived is derived from the conclusion that\nan all-perfect God exists.\n\n\nThus rendered, Descartes\u2019 broader argument is viciously\ncircular. The italicized segment of Arc 1 marks an addition to the\noriginal statement of it, thereby clarifying the circularity reading.\nInterpreted in this way, Descartes begins his Third Meditation proofs\nof God by presupposing the general veracity of clear and distinct\nperception. That is, he starts by assuming the C&D Rule and then\nuses the rule in the course of demonstrating it. Evidently, this way\nof reading Descartes\u2019 argument has pedagogical appeal, for it is\nwidely taught (outside of Descartes scholarship) despite the absence\nof serious textual merit. If there is one point of general agreement\nin the scholarly literature, it is that the texts do not sustain this\ninterpretation.\n\nHow then should Arc 1 be understood? There are multiple\ninterpretations that avoid vicious circularity, along with\nnumerous schemes for cataloguing them. For present purposes, \nwe\u2019ll catalogue the various accounts according to two\nmain kinds of non-circular strategies that commentators attribute\nto Descartes. (The secondary literature offers multiple variations\non each of these main kinds of interpretations, though the\nvariations won\u2019t here be explored. For further alternative \nschemes for cataloguing interpretations, see Hatfield 2006 and\nNewman & Nelson 1999. For an anthology devoted largely to the \nCartesian Circle, see Doney 1987.)\n\n\nBounded Doubt interpretations:\n\nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived\n\u2013 indeed, premises belonging to a special class of truths\nthat are fully immune to doubt prior to establishing the general\nveracity of propositions that are clearly and distinctly\nperceived.\n\nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived is derived from the conclusion that\nan all-perfect God exists.\n\n\nAgain, the italicized segment marks an addition to the original\nstatement of Arc 1. Call this a \u2018Bounded Doubt\u2019\ninterpretation, because this kind of interpretation construes\nhyperbolic doubt as bounded. More precisely, the Evil Genius\nDoubt is (on this reading) bounded in the sense that its sceptical\npotency does not extend to all judgments: a special class of truths is\noutside the bounds of doubt. Exemplary of this special class are the\ncogito and, importantly, the premises of the Third Meditation\nproofs of God. Propositions in this special class can be perfectly\nknown, even by atheists.\n\nOn this interpretation, there is no vicious circularity in the broader\nargument, because the truths serving as premises in the arguments for\nthe C&D Rule are perfectly knowable independently of that rule.\nThat is, throughout the arguments of Arcs 1 and 2, the premises\nemployed count as perfectly knowledge prior to the knowledge\nof the C&D Rule they help establish.\n\nProponents of this interpretation are apt to cite the Third Meditation\npassage distinguishing what\u2019s revealed by the natural\nlight, and what\u2019s taught by nature (see\n Section 4.3).\nIn order to extend perfect knowledge beyond the privileged class of\ntruths (revealed by the natural light), it is necessary to establish\nthe general veracity of the C&D Rule. Thus, the need (on this\ninterpretation) for Arc 2 in the broader project.\n\nThe other main kind of interpretation avoids circularity in a\ndifferent manner. Let\u2019s consider that alternative.\n\n\nUnbounded Doubt interpretations:\n\nArc 1: The conclusion that an all-perfect God exists\nis derived from premises that are clearly and distinctly perceived\n\u2013 i.e., premises that are accepted despite being vulnerable\nto Evil Genius Doubt, because our cognitive nature compels us to\nassent to clearly and distinctly perceived propositions.\n\nArc 2: The general veracity of propositions that are\nclearly and distinctly perceived is derived from the conclusion that\nan all-perfect God exists.\n\n\nAgain, the italicized segment marks an addition to the original\nstatement of Arc 1. Let\u2019s call this an \u2018Unbounded\nDoubt\u2019 interpretation, because this kind of interpretation\nconstrues hyperbolic doubt as unbounded. More precisely,\nthe Evil Genius Doubt is (on this reading) unbounded in the sense\nthat it undermines all manner of judgments \u2013 even\nthe cogito, even the premises of the Third Meditation\nproofs of God \u2013 when the mind is no longer attending to them \nclearly and distinctly. Insofar as the meditator assents to the\nsteps of these proofs, he does so not because of having an \nunderstanding of clear and distinct perceptions as being guaranteed \ntrue, but because the mind cannot but assent to them \nwhile attending clearly and distinctly.\n\nImportantly, if doubt is thus unbounded there is no circularity. For,\non this reading of Arc 1, the arguments therein do not presuppose the\ngeneral veracity of the C&D Rule. The premises contributing to\nthe conclusion of an all-perfect God remain vulnerable to hyperbolic\ndoubt. Throughout this stage of the inquiry, none of the\nmeditator\u2019s judgments based in clear and distinct perception\nconstitutes perfect knowledge. It is the unboundedness of hyperbolic\ndoubt that underwrites the No Atheistic Perfect Knowledge Thesis.\n\nA central feature of this interpretation is worth repeating. It\nis natural for critics to ask why the arguments of Arc 1 are\naccepted by the meditator if, indeed, Evil Genius Doubt\nremains in play. The answer lies in the indirect manner\nin which the doubt undermines clear and distinct perception\n (Section 4.3).\nWhile clearly and distinctly attending to a proposition,\nthe mind cannot but assent: \u201cmy nature is such that\nso long as I perceive something very clearly and distinctly I\ncannot but believe it to be true.\u201d Therefore, while\nthe meditator attends to the steps of the Third Meditation arguments \nfor God, he cannot but accept them. However, the meditator does not \n(yet) have perfect knowledge of those premises, nor of their \nconclusions. How, then, do those matters finally rise to the status\nof perfect knowledge? We return to this issue, below. At present,\nthe focus is on the issue of circularity.\n\nThough bounded and unbounded doubt interpretations can both avoid \nvicious circularity, each confronts further difficulties \u2013\nboth textual and philosophical. Avoiding the charge of vicious \ncircularity marks the beginning of the interpreter\u2019s work,\nnot the end. Bounded doubt interpreters must explain why, in the \nfirst place, the Evil Genius Doubt\u2019s potency does\nnot extend to propositions in the special class. Unbounded doubt \ninterpreters must explain why, in the final analysis,\nthe Evil Genius Doubt eventually loses it undermining potency. \nLet\u2019s consider each of these further problems.\n\nGranting a bounded doubt interpretation, why \u2013 in the first\nplace \u2013 does the Evil Genius Doubt\u2019s potency not extend\nto propositions in the special class? How is it that the doubt\ndoes undermine the proposition \u201cthat two and three\nadded together make five,\u201d but not the proposition\n\u201cthat there must be at least as much [reality] in the efficient\nand total cause as in the effect of that cause\u201d? The first\nproposition is included in the list of examples that are\nundermined by the Evil Genius Doubt (see the fourth paragraph of the\nThird Meditation). The second proposition is a premise in a Third\nMeditation argument for God \u2013 a proposition immune to doubt,\naccording to bounded doubt interpretations. What is supposed to be\nthe relevant difference between these propositions? Given the indirect\nmanner in which Evil Genius Doubt operates, there seems no clear\nexplanation of why the doubt succeeds in undermining the first\nproposition but is somehow resisted by the second. Further awkward for\nthis interpretation is that the cogito is included in the\nlist of examples that that same fourth paragraph passage implies is\nvulnerable to doubt.\n\nGranting an unbounded doubt interpretation, why \u2013 in the final\nanalysis \u2013 does the Evil Genius Doubt eventually lose its\nundermining potency? Putting the point ironically: Why doesn\u2019t\nthe Evil Genius Doubt undermine the very arguments intended to refute\nthe Evil Genius Doubt, as soon as the mind is no longer attending to\nthose premises? Consider Descartes\u2019 own explanation of how\nhyperbolic doubt undermines the conclusions of arguments once their\npremises are no longer in the mind\u2019s view:\n\nThere are other truths which are perceived very clearly by our\nintellect so long as we attend to the arguments on which our knowledge\nof them depends; and we are therefore incapable of doubting them\nduring this time. But we may forget the arguments in question and\nlater remember simply the conclusions which were deduced from them.\nThe question will now arise as to whether we possess the same firm and\nimmutable conviction concerning these conclusions, when we simply\nrecollect that they were previously deduced from quite evident\nprinciples (our ability to call them \u2018conclusions\u2019\npresupposes such a recollection). (Replies 2, AT 7:146, CSM 2:104)\n\n\nSo, when we\u2019re no longer clearly and distinctly perceiving the\nsteps of an argument, we do not \u201cpossess the same firm and\nimmutable conviction\u201d of its conclusion. But precisely such\nmoments are when hyperbolic doubt does its undermining work. This\nmeans that upon diverting attention from the premises of Arcs 1 and\n2, it would then be possible to run the Evil Genius Doubt on their conclusions. It would thus seem that unbounded doubt interpretations \nleave us in a Sisyphus-like predicament. According to the myth, each \ntime Sisyphus pushes his boulder near to the top of the hill, the \nboulder slips away, rolling to the very bottom, and the whole process \nmust start all over. By carefully constructing the arguments of Arcs\n1 and 2, the meditator gains anti-sceptical momentum, pushing his \nproject near to the goal of perfect knowledge. But each time, once\nhis attention is diverted from the steps of the arguments, he finds\nhimself back at the bottom of the hill, wondering about the\ncredibility of those proofs that had seemed so evident: that is\n(as Descartes states the comparable problem, above), the question\nnow arises \u201cas to whether we possess the same firm and\nimmutable conviction concerning these conclusions, when we simply\nrecollect that they were previously deduced from quite evident\nprinciples.\u201d As Michael Ayers writes:\n\nDescartes\u2019s enterprise might well look worthless. For even\nif it were granted that his argument is both valid and simple enough\nto be grasped intuitively, as soon as it is no longer so grasped it \nwould seem to fall open to the very same doubt as it refutes. What\nis the value of such a momentary triumph over scepticism? (1998,\n1013)\n\n\nLet\u2019s turn to an account that purports to solve this problem\narising with unbounded doubt interpretations.\n\n(For examples of bounded doubt interpretations, see Broughton 2002, \nDoney 1955, Della Rocca 2005, Kenny 1968, Morris 1973,\nRickless 2005, and Wilson 1978. For examples of unbounded doubt \ninterpretations, see Carriero 2009, Curley 1978 and 1993, DeRose \n1992, Loeb 1992, Newman 2012, Newman & Nelson 1999, Sosa \n1997a and 1997b, and Van Cleve 1979.)\n6.2 Self-Evident God Interpretation\n\nAgain, the hard question for unbounded doubt interpretations: Why,\nin the final analysis, does the Evil Genius Doubt eventually lose it\nundermining potency? One recent unbounded doubt interpretation (Newman\n& Nelson 1999) offers a solution, including an explanation of why\nDescartes waits until the end of the Fifth Meditation to claim final\nvictory over the sceptical problem. Here is a sketch of the\naccount.\n\nDescartes claims that his final solution to the sceptical problem\nmakes it \u201cimpossible for us ever to have any reason for\ndoubting what we are convinced of.\u201d Yet how is this \nimpossibility supposed to be achieved? We have seen\nthat the sticking point in the account is indirect doubt. \nDescartes rejects that we could overcome the problem via\nuninterrupted clear and distinct perception: \u201cmy nature is\nalso such that I cannot fix my mental vision continually on the\nsame thing, so as to keep perceiving it clearly; and often the\nmemory of a previously made judgement may come back, when I am\nno longer attending to the arguments which led me to make it.\u201d\nAt such moments of inattention, an indirect doubt remains possible\nso long as we can make sense of the evil genius scenario, or any\nother scenario wherein we have a defective cognitive nature. It\nthus seems that a final solution to the problem would need (somehow)\nto make it no longer possible to make sense of the relevant sceptical \nscenarios. Indeed, the proposed interpretation has it the sceptical \nscenarios become self-evidently incoherent. We come to have an\nutterly basic apprehension that we\u2019re the creation of an\nall-perfect creator who would not allow us to be deceived about\nwhat we clearly and distinctly perceive.\n\nThe needed apprehension of God would have to be self-evident. \nFor suppose my apprehension is grounded in a demonstration. In that \ncase, it\u2019s possible to think of the conclusion of that \ndemonstration without also thinking of the premises; and on such \noccasions, my confidence in the demonstration is vulnerable to an \nindirect doubt. Thus, the needed apprehension of God is a self-evident, \nclear and distinct conception that renders \u2013 as literally \nunthinkable \u2013 the very sceptical scenarios that underwrite \nindirect doubt.\n\nA useful analogy lies in the doubt-resisting character of the\ncogito. If I attempt a direct doubt of own my\nexistence, the effort is self-stultifying; I immediately apprehend\nthat I must exist, in order to attempt the doubt. What Descartes\nneeds is a similarly strong and immediate doubt-resisting outcome\nin connection with the very attempt at running an indirect \ndoubt. That is, on occasions of trying to undermine clearly and \ndistinctly perceived matters \u2013 e.g., by doubting God\u2019s \nexistence, or benevolence, or the like \u2013 the very effort at\ndoubt would be immediately thwarted.\n\nMultiple texts suggest that this is the account Descartes intends,\nand that the Fifth Meditation is the locus of the meditator\u2019s\ndiscovery of an enhanced, self-evident apprehension of God. The\nFifth Meditation introduces various themes about innate truths, \nincluding the positive epistemic effects of repeated meditation:\ntruths initially noticed only by means of inference might eventually \ncome to be apprehended self-evidently. In the build-up to the\npassage claiming that the Evil Genius Doubt is finally and fully \novercome, Descartes writes:\n\nSome of the things I clearly and distinctly perceive are obvious to\neveryone, while others are discovered only by those who look more\nclosely and investigate more carefully; but once they have been\ndiscovered, the latter are judged to be just as certain as the former.\nIn the case of a right-angled triangle, for example, the fact that the\nsquare on the hypotenuse is equal to the square on the other two sides\nis not so readily apparent as the fact that the hypotenuse subtends\nthe largest angle; but once one has seen it, one believes it just as\nstrongly. But as regards God, if I were not overwhelmed by\npreconceived opinions, and if the images of things perceived by the\nsenses did not besiege my thought on every side, I would certainly\nacknowledge him sooner and more easily than anything else. For what is\nmore self-evident [ex se est apertius] than the fact that the\nsupreme being exists, or that God, to whose essence alone existence\nbelongs, exists?\nAlthough it needed close attention for me to\nperceive this, I am now just as certain of it as I am of everything\nelse which appears most certain. And what is more, I see that the\ncertainty of all other things depends on this, so that without it\nnothing can ever be perfectly known. (AT 7:69, CSM 2:47f)\n\n\nDescartes reiterates the theme in the Second Replies:\n\nI ask my readers to spend a great deal of time and effort on\ncontemplating the nature of the supremely perfect being. Above all\nthey should reflect on the fact that the ideas of all other natures\ncontain possible existence, whereas the idea of God contains not only\npossible but wholly necessary existence. This alone, without a formal\nargument, will make them realize that God exists; and this will\neventually be just as self-evident [per se notum] to them as\nthe fact that the number two is even or that three is odd, and so on.\nFor there are certain truths which some people find self-evident,\nwhile others come to understand them only by means of a formal\nargument. (AT 7:163f, CSM 2:115)\n\n\nThese passages convey that one\u2019s apprehension of God eventually\nupgrades from being inferential, to being transparently self-evident.\nGranting that the meditator has achieved an apprehension of God of\nthis kind, it plausibly explains why Descartes would think he\u2019s\nachieved a final solution to the sceptical problem. Given his newfound\nepistemic standing, the meditator would be unable to make coherent\nsense of the Evil Genius Doubt. His clear and distinct perceptions\nwould be fully indubitable, thereby counting as perfect knowledge.\n\nThe interpretation helps explain two passages wherein Descartes\npurports to be detailing the final solution to the sceptical problem.\nIn both passages, he can seem simply to be asserting that\nsceptical doubts are impossible, as if having forgotten the\nindirect manner in which his own hyperbolic doubt operates.\nBut if we take Descartes to be assuming that the apprehension of God\nhas become utterly self-evident, both passages make more sense. The\none passage arises in the Second Replies, in the context of rebutting\nan objection to the effect that, in the final analysis, it remains\npossible to doubt clear and distinct perception. Descartes replies\nthat the objector is \u201cstill stuck fast\u201d in doubts\n\u201cput forward in the First Meditation,\u201d but \u201cvery\ncarefully removed in the succeeding Meditations,\u201d adding:\n\n[O]nce we have become aware that God exists it is necessary for us to\nimagine that he is a deceiver if we wish to cast doubt on what we\nclearly and distinctly perceive. And since it is impossible to\nimagine that he is a deceiver, whatever we clearly and distinctly\nperceive must be completely accepted as true and certain. (AT 7:144,\nCSM 2:103; italics added)\n\n\nThe other passage arises in the Fifth Meditation, in the concluding\nsummary explanation of how the sceptical problem is finally overcome.\nImportantly, on the present interpretation, is the context in which\nthe summary explanation occurs: namely, on the heels of revealing the\nnewly discovered thesis, that nothing \u201cis more self-evident than\nthe fact that the supreme being exists.\u201d In that context,\nDescartes explains that a final solution to the sceptical problem has\nbeen achieved.\n\nNow, however, I have perceived that God exists, and at the same time I\nhave understood that everything else depends on him, and that he is no\ndeceiver; and I have drawn the conclusion that everything which I\nclearly and distinctly perceive is of necessity true. Accordingly,\neven if I am no longer attending to the arguments which led me to\njudge that this is true, as long as I remember that I clearly and\ndistinctly perceived it, there are no counter-arguments which can be\nadduced to make me doubt it, but on the contrary I have true and\ncertain knowledge of it. And I have knowledge not just of this matter,\nbut of all matters which I remember ever having demonstrated, in\ngeometry and so on. For what objections can now be raised? That the\nway I am made makes me prone to frequent error? But I now know that I\nam incapable of error in those cases where my understanding is\ntransparently clear. Or can it be objected that I have in the past\nregarded as true and certain many things which I afterwards recognized\nto be false? But none of these were things which I clearly and\ndistinctly perceived: I was ignorant of this rule for establishing the\ntruth, and believed these things for other reasons which I later\ndiscovered to be less reliable. So what is left to say? (AT 7:70, CSM\n2:48f)\n\n\nAbsent a self-evident apprehension of God, the two passages appear\ninexplicable, with Descartes seeming to misunderstand the sceptical\nimplications of his own Evil Genius Doubt. But on the self-evident God\ninterpretation, both passages read as a summary of the anti-sceptical\neffects of it being impossible to conceive of God as a deceiver. As\nDescartes writes to Voetius, the very thought of God as a deceiver\n\u201cimplies a conceptual contradiction \u2013 that is, it cannot\nbe conceived\u201d (May 1643 letter, AT 8b:60, CSMK 222). The\ninterpretation also makes sense of why the final victory over\nscepticism is announced not at the end of the Fourth Meditation, but\nat the end the Fifth \u2013 i.e., after the enhanced, self-evident \napprehension of God is supposed to have been achieved.\n\n(For further discussion see Newman & Nelson 1999, Nolan 2005,\nand Nolan &and Nelson 2006.)\n6.3 Another Cartesian Circle?\n\nMichael Della Rocca has recently argued that a further circle arises\nfrom considerations in the Fourth Meditation \u2013 a problem he\nsuspects is \u201cmore difficult to get out of than the traditional\nproblem of circularity\u201d (2011, 98). To help clarify this further\ncircle, Della Rocca focuses on a twofold question:\n\nWhy, for Descartes, should we not assent to ideas that are not clear\nand distinct and why is there no such obligation not to assent to\nclear and distinct ideas? The reason Descartes offers seems to be that\nwe should not assent to ideas that are not clear and distinct because\nthey, unlike clear and distinct ideas, are not guaranteed to be true.\n(2011, 96)\n\n\nAs Della Rocca understands the broader Fourth Meditation argument, the\nclaim that we should assent only to what we clearly and distinctly\nperceive is an essential step in the ongoing argument to establish the\ndivine guarantee of clear and distinct perception. Since this step\npresupposes the eventual conclusion, that conclusion is based on\ncircular reasoning:\n\nOne of the premises needed for arguing that clear and distinct ideas\nare true is, as we have seen, that we should assent only to clear and\ndistinct ideas. This claim, in turn, requires argument, and the\nargument for it seems to be based on the claim that clear and distinct\nideas are guaranteed to be true. So, one of the premises of the\nargument for the claim that clear and distinct ideas are true is that\nclear and distinct ideas are guaranteed to be true. Here, the\nconclusion \u2013 indeed, a strengthened version of the conclusion\n\u2013 is itself a premise in the argument. (2011, 98)\n\n\nPerhaps we can avoid this alleged circle. The linchpin of Della\nRocca\u2019s charge of circularity is his contention that\n\u201cDescartes\u2019s reason for saying that we should assent only\nto clear and distinct ideas is that such ideas are guaranteed to be\ntrue and ideas that are not clear and distinct are not guaranteed to\nbe true\u201d (2011, 97). Though Descartes can be read in this way,\nthe texts support the following alternative understanding of the\nbroader argumentative narrative. In the First Meditation, the\nmeditator initially resolves that he should withhold assent to\nanything which is \u201cnot completely certain and indubitable\u201d\n(AT 7:18, CSM 2:12). Early in the Third Meditation, having reflected\non the epistemic impressiveness of the cogito, the meditator\ndiscovers that all, but only, clear and distinct\nperceptions are utterly assent-compelling. As a practical consequence,\nhis initial resolve effectively implies that he should assent only to\nclear and distinct perceptions \u2013 not because of presupposing the\nconclusion of the eventual proof of the C&D Rule, but because\nthese are the only perceptions to which he can\u2019t but\nassent. This provides a practical answer to Della Rocca\u2019s\nquestion, concerning why we should \u201cnot assent to ideas that are\nnot clear and distinct and why is there no such obligation not to\nassent to clear and distinct ideas.\u201d It is in the Fourth\nMeditation that the meditator purports to demonstrate the divine\nguarantee of the C&D Rule. However, no step of that demonstration\npresupposes that clear and distinct perceptions have already been\nestablished as true; i.e., the conclusion of the demonstration is not,\nas Della Rocca contends, \u201cbased on the claim that clear and\ndistinct ideas are guaranteed to be true.\u201d Rather (as we saw in\n Section 5.3),\n the conclusion purports to be based on an analysis of the respective\ncontributions of the intellect and the will, to judgment formation.\nSummarizing the key steps:\n\nSo what then is the source of my mistakes? It must be simply this: the\nscope of the will is wider than that of the intellect; but instead of\nrestricting it within the same limits, I extend its use to matters\nwhich I do not understand. (AT 7:58, CSM 2:40)\n\n\nGranted, the meditator needs each of the demonstrative steps to be\nclearly and distinctly perceived. However, he needs this not because\nof presupposing the conclusion to be proved, but in order to be in\ncompliance with his own initial resolve, stated in the First\nMeditation \u2013 to withhold assent to anything which is\n\u201cnot completely certain and indubitable.\u201d\n\nCentral to the above account avoiding Della Rocca\u2019s circle is\n(among other claims) the thesis that clear and distinct perceptions\nare assent-compelling \u2013 i.e., as Descartes writes, that\n\u201cthe nature of my mind is such that I cannot but assent to these\nthings, at least so long as I clearly perceive them.\u201d It it thus\nworth noting that Della Rocca wavers on whether Descartes holds this\nthesis: he interprets a remark in Descartes\u2019 correspondence (9\nFeb 1645, AT 4:173, CSMK 245) to suggest \u201cthat we can withhold\nassent from even a current clear and distinct perception\u201d (2006,\n155).\n6.4 Is Truth a Condition of Perfect Knowledge?\n\nWe noted in\n Section 1.1\n that Descartes\u2019 clearest statements appear to indicate a\njustified belief analysis of perfect knowledge. Consider\nagain the relevant Second Replies passage:\n\nHence you see that once we have become aware that\nGod exists it is necessary for us to imagine that he is a deceiver if\nwe wish to cast doubt on what we clearly and distinctly perceive. And\nsince it is impossible to imagine that he is a deceiver, whatever we\nclearly and distinctly perceive must be completely accepted as true\nand certain.\nBut since I see that you are still stuck fast in\nthe doubts which I put forward in the First Meditation, and which I\nthought I had very carefully removed in the succeeding Meditations, I\nshall now expound for a second time the basis on which it seems to me\nthat all human certainty can be founded.\nFirst of all, as soon as we think that we\ncorrectly perceive something, we are spontaneously convinced that it\nis true. Now if this conviction is so firm that it is impossible for\nus ever to have any reason for doubting what we are convinced of, then\nthere are no further questions for us to ask: we have everything that\nwe could reasonably want. What is it to us that someone may make out\nthat the perception whose truth we are so firmly convinced of may\nappear false to God or an angel, so that it is, absolutely speaking,\nfalse? Why should this alleged \u201cabsolute falsity\u201d bother\nus, since we neither believe in it nor have even the smallest\nsuspicion of it? For the supposition which we are making here is of a\nconviction so firm that it is quite incapable of being destroyed; and\nsuch a conviction is clearly the same as the most perfect certainty.\n(AT 7:144f, CSM 2:103)\n\n\nThe last part of the passage emphasizes two conditions: a belief\ncondition, expressed in terms of conviction, and a\njustification condition, expressed in terms of indubitability\nor unshakability \u2013 \u201cconviction based on a reason so strong\nthat it can never be shaken by any stronger reason.\u201d\nConspicuously missing is any further condition stipulating that\nthe conviction must be true. The passage does clarify,\nof anything that would count as perfect knowledge, that it is\n\u201ccompletely accepted as true\u201d; that we are\n\u201cconvinced that it is true,\u201d indeed, that we are\n\u201cfirmly convinced.\u201d But these remarks speak to the\nbelief condition, not to an expressed truth condition. \nIndeed, the passage is plausibly read even more strongly: i.e.,\nnot merely as omitting mention of a truth condition, but as\nallowing for some broad possibility that what we regard\nas indubitable truths are, \u201cabsolutely speaking, \nfalse.\u201d\n\nWhy, then, is Descartes dismissive of the stated objection, indicating\nthat it shouldn\u2019t \u201cbother\u201d us? On one plausible \nreading of the passage, Descartes is assuming that the \npossibility in question is simply a further iteration of\nEvil Genius Doubt \u2013 \u201cI see that you are still stuck fast\nin the doubts which I put forward in the First Meditation.\u201d \nWhether a deceiving God is really possible, it\u2019s \nsomething Descartes has argued to be unimaginable for perfect\nknowers, i.e., for successful graduates of the Meditations \n\u2013 \u201cit is impossible to imagine that he [God] is a \ndeceiver.\u201d On a plausible reading, therefore, Descartes is \ndismissive of the objection not on metaphysical grounds of absolute \nimpossibility, but on epistemic grounds of indubitability:\nthe \u201calleged \u2018absolute falsity\u2019,\u201d noted in\nthe objection, should in no way \u201cbother us\u201d because our \nconviction is \u201cso firm that it is quite incapable of being \ndestroyed.\u201d\n\nWhy does Descartes not add a truth condition, thereby ensuring that\nbeliefs counting as perfect knowledge are true? In an \ninfluential 1970 book, Harry Frankfurt offers a provocative answer.\nHe argues that Descartes\u2019 goal, truth-wise, is to establish\nthe consistency of our beliefs, but not their correspondence with\nan external reality. Writes Frankfurt:\n\nThe point of Descartes\u2019s validation of reason is that if reason\nis properly employed \u2013 that is, if we give assent only to what\nwe clearly and distinctly perceive \u2013 we are not led to doubt\nthat reason is reliable. \u2026 The crux of Descartes\u2019s\nvalidation of reason is not so much the discovery that a benign deity\nexists, but that reason leads to the conclusion that such a deity\nexists. (1970, 176)\n\n\nFrankfurt thinks that Descartes\u2019 novel plan involves arguing\nthat our best rational efforts show that our best rational efforts are\nlogically consistent: it is \u201can attempt to show that there are\nno good reasons for believing that reason is unreliable \u2013 that\nthe mistrust of reason is not supported by reason and that it is\naccordingly irrational\u201d (1970, 175). Frankfurt adds that\n\u201cthe conception of truth involved in [Descartes\u2019] question\nabout the truth of what is clearly and distinctly perceived is, in\nother words, a conception of coherence rather than of\ncorrespondence\u201d (1970, 170).\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s coherentist interpretation is at odds with a number\nof textual and doctrinal considerations. Descartes writes to Mersenne\nthat \u201cthe word \u2018truth\u2019, in the strict sense, denotes\nthe conformity of thought with its object\u201d (16 Oct 1639, AT\n2:597, CSMK 139). The suggestion here is of some version of a\ncorrespondence theory. Also, on the most straightforward reading of\nthe epistemic moves in the Meditations, Descartes is\npresupposing that at least some truths involve extramental\nmetaphysical relations. Consider that Evil Genius Doubt is,\nfundamentally, a worry not about whether our various clear and\ndistinct judgments cohere, but about whether they accurately\nrepresent an extramental reality \u2013 i.e., a doubt about\n\u201cwhether things do in reality correspond to our perception of\nthem\u201d (Replies 4, AT 7:226, CSM 2:159). Interestingly, Frankfurt\nhimself came to renounce the interpretation:\n\nI now think, however, that it was a mistake on my part to suggest that\nDescartes entertained a coherence conception of truth. The fact is\nthat there is no textual evidence to support that suggestion; on the\ncontrary, whenever Descartes gives an explicit account of truth he\nexplains it unequivocally as correspondence with reality. (1978, 36f)\n\n\nHow then should we interpret the Second Replies passage, and how\nshould we understand the absence of a truth condition? I suggest that\nthe lack of a truth condition need not reflect an indifference about\ntruth, as opposed to a view about how a concern for truth is properly\nexpressed in an account of knowledge. We can understand Descartes as\nwanting a fully internalist account whereby all\nconditions of knowledge are accessible to the would-be knower. Putting\nthe point another way, if the question of whether the\nconditions of knowledge had been met were answerable only by\n\u201cGod or an angel,\u201d it would impose an unacceptably\nexternalist element on the theory. On a justified\nbelief rendering, his account of perfect knowledge is\nfully internalist; yet, with the addition of a truth condition, it is\nnot \u2013 at least, not given a correspondence theory of\ntruth, in the context of metaphysical realism. Importantly, then, in\nattributing to Descartes a justified belief account, we need not\nthereby attribute to him an indifference concerning truth.\nRather, we can attribute to him the view that the way properly to\nexpress one\u2019s concern for truth is by enforcing high\njustificatory standards. Again, from that same passage:\n\nNow if this conviction is so firm that it is impossible for us ever to\nhave any reason for doubting what we are convinced of, then there are\nno further questions for us to ask: we have everything that we could\nreasonably want.\n\n\nOne possible objection to a justified belief account is expressed by\nLennon, who worries that on such accounts the desired cognitive state\n(indubitability) \u201ccould as well be achieved by a pill\u201d;\nadding that \u201cDescartes would not be satisfied with such a pill\nbecause his aim is not just to arrive at certainty, but truth, which\nhe cannot help but think he has achieved\u201d (2008, 167). (Cf.\nHatfield 2006, 135, who expresses a related objection.)\n\nGranted, if the pill simply prevented me from apprehending any reasons\nfor doubting my beliefs, we\u2019d be loath to regard such beliefs as\nknowledge. Descartes himself makes a related point in connection with\nan atheist geometer who happens never to doubt his beliefs, simply\nbecause the Evil Genius Doubt never occurs to him:\n\n[A]lthough this doubt may not occur to him, it can still crop up if\nsomeone else raises the point or if he looks into the matter himself.\nSo he will never be free of this doubt until he acknowledges that God\nexists. (Replies 2, AT 7:141, CSM 2:101)\n\n\nPresumably, Descartes\u2019 point holds whether the doubt simply\nnever occurs to him, or is instead prevented from occurring by a\npill. Note further that the spirit of the objection presupposes that \nthe achieved indubitability is merely psychological, in that \nthe person simply runs up against an inexplicable inability\nto doubt. Yet we have seen clear texts which have Descartes \ncharacterizing the desired states of clarity and distinctness not \nmerely psychologically, but, further, in epistemic terms implying a \nsort of cognitive luminance, or rational insight.\nHe uses light metaphors including the association of clarity and \ndistinctness with the natural light.  The meditator\u2019s \nability to ward off the evil demon \u2013 during occurrent clarity\nand distinctness \u2013 is described in terms of perceiving \n\u201cutterly clearly with [the] mind\u2019s eye\u201d; and of\nbeing \u201cconvinced\u201d of all matters the denial of which\nleads one to \u201csee a manifest contradiction\u201d (Med. 3,\nAT 7:36, CSM 2:25). In Descartes\u2019 view, our inability to doubt \nthe matters we clearly and distinctly perceive is not simply a causal \nresult, but also a rational result of what such perception enables\nus to understand. Were there a pill that would induce both the\ncausal and the rational outcomes that Descartes associates with\nperfect knowledge, then, arguably, he would endorse taking the pill.  \nFor we would then \u201chave everything that we could reasonably \nwant.\u201d\n\nAnother possible objection is that Descartes\u2019 high justificatory\nstandards generate a de facto truth condition: because having\nCartesian certainty entails that one\u2019s beliefs are\ntrue, truth is a necessary condition of knowledge. But this objection\nmisses a key point. As suggested in the Second Replies passage,\nCartesian certainty \u2013 understood in terms of\nindubitability \u2013 does not, strictly speaking, rule out\nthe broad possibility that we are in error. The notions of\nindubitability and truth are different: that\n\u201cp is indubitable\u201d entails not that\n\u201cp is true,\u201d but that \u201cthere can be no\nreasons for doubting p.\u201d Descartes\u2019 final\nsolution to the Evil Genius Doubt entails not that an evil genius\ncannot be, but that it cannot be coherently\nconceived. And that it cannot be coherently conceived, thinks\nDescartes, gives us \u201ceverything that we could reasonably\nwant\u201d \u2013 not because such coherence is the goal, but\nbecause of what it establishes, truth-wise.\n\n(For further discussion of the role of truth in perfect knowledge, see\nFrankfurt 1970 and 1978, Hatfield 2006, Lennon 2008, Loeb\n1992, and Newman & Nelson 1999.)\n7. Proving an External Material World\n\nThe opening line of the Sixth Meditation makes clear its principal\nobjective: \u201cIt remains for me to examine whether material things\nexist\u201d (AT 7:71, CSM 2:50). At this juncture, the meditator\nperfectly knows of his own existence and of God\u2019s. It follows\nthat there\u2019s an external world with at least one object, namely,\nGod. However, the existence of an external material world\nremains in doubt. Establishing the existence of material bodies is not\na straightforward matter of perceiving them, because, in\nDescartes\u2019 view, \u201cbodies are not strictly perceived by the\nsenses\u201d (see\n Section 9.1).\n\nIn his eventual argument, Descartes\u2019 strategy for proving an\nexternal material world has two main parts: first, he argues for the\nexternality of the causes of sensation; second, he argues for\nthe materiality of these external causes. (Calling the ideas\nin question \u201csensations\u201d can seem circular, if one\nconceives of sensations as having a physiological component. But note\nthat for Descartes, \u201cwhat is called \u2018having a sensory\nperception\u2019,\u201d strictly encompasses only a mental aspect\nMed. 2, AT 7:29, CSM 2:19). From these two steps, it follows that there\nexists an external material world. Let\u2019s consider each phase of\nthe argument.\n7.1 Case for the Externality\nof the Causes of Sensation\n\nDescartes builds on a familiar line of argument in the history of\nphilosophy, itself appealing to the involuntariness of sensations.\nThe familiar argument is first articulated in the Third Meditation.\nSpeaking of his apparently adventitious ideas (sensations), the\nmeditator remarks:\n\nBut the chief question at this point concerns the ideas which I take\nto be derived from things existing outside me \u2026 I know by\nexperience that these ideas do not depend on my will, and hence that\nthey do not depend simply on me. Frequently I notice them even when I\ndo not want to: now, for example, I feel the heat whether I want to or\nnot, and this is why I think that this sensation or idea of heat comes\nto me from something other than myself, namely the heat of the fire by\nwhich I am sitting. (AT 7:38, CSM 2:26)\n\n\nThough some such involuntariness argument has convinced many\nphilosophers, the inference does not hold up to methodical doubt, as\nthe meditator explains:\n\nThen again, although these [apparently adventitious] ideas do not\ndepend on my will, it does not follow that they must come from things\nlocated outside me. Just as the impulses which I was speaking of a\nmoment ago seem opposed to my will even though they are within me, so\nthere may be some other faculty [of my mind] not yet fully known to\nme, which produces these ideas without any assistance from external\nthings; this is, after all, just how I have always thought ideas are\nproduced in me when I am dreaming. (Med. 3, AT 7:39, CSM 2:27)\n\n\nWe first examined this passage in regard to the Always Dreaming Doubt.\nThat sceptical hypothesis raises the problem of the existence of\nexternal things. For all I know, my \u201cwaking\u201d experiences \nare produced not by external things, but by processes similar to those\nproducing my dreams. This sceptical possibility explains why the\nfamiliar involuntariness argument fails: the inference presupposes\nexactly what is at issue \u2013 namely, whether involuntarily\nreceived sensory ideas are produced by external things, rather than\nby a subconscious faculty of my mind.\n\nMany philosophers have assumed that we lack the epistemic resources to\nsolve this sceptical problem. For example, Hume writes:\n\nBy what argument can it be proved, that the perceptions of the mind\nmust be caused by external objects \u2026 and could not arise either\nfrom the energy of the mind itself \u2026 or from some other cause\nstill more unknown to us? It is acknowledged, that, in fact, many of\nthese perceptions arise not from anything external, as in dreams,\nmadness, and other diseases. \u2026 It is a question of fact,\nwhether the perceptions of the senses be produced by external objects\n\u2026 But here experience is, and must be entirely silent.\n(Enquiry Sec. 12)\n\n\nInterestingly, Descartes would agree that experiential\nresources cannot solve the problem. By the Sixth Meditation, however,\nDescartes purports to have the innate resources he needs to\nsolve it \u2013 notably, innate ideas of mind and body. Among the\nmetaphysical theses he develops is that mind and body have wholly\ndistinct essences: the essence of thinking substance is pure thought;\nthe essence of body is pure extension. In a remarkable maneuver,\nDescartes invokes this distinction to refute the sceptical worry that\nsensations are produced by a subconscious faculty of the mind:\n\u201cnothing can be in me, that is to say, in my mind, of which I am\nnot aware,\u201d and this \u201cfollows from the fact that the soul\nis distinct from the body and that its essence is to think\u201d (13\nDec 1640 letter to Mersenne, AT 3:273, CSMK 165f). This result allows\nDescartes to supplement the involuntariness argument, thereby\nstrengthening the inference. For from the additional premise that\nnothing can be in my mind of which I am unaware, it follows\nthat if sensations were being produced by some activity in my mind,\nI\u2019d be aware of that activity on the occasion of its operation.\nSince I\u2019m not thus aware, it follows that the sensation\nI\u2019m having is produced by a cause external to my mind. As\nDescartes writes, this cause\n\n\u2026 cannot be in me, since clearly it presupposes no intellectual\nact [of awareness] on my part, and the ideas in question are produced\nwithout my cooperation and often even against my will. So the only\nalternative is that it is in another substance distinct from me\n\u2026 (Med. 6, AT 7:79, CSM 2:55)\n\n\nIt follows that my sensations are caused by external world objects\n\u2013 i.e., objects external to my mind. It remains to be shown that\nthese external causes are material objects.\n7.2 Case for the Materiality\nof the Causes of Sensation\n\nOn Descartes\u2019 analysis, there are three possible options for the\nkind of external thing causing sensations:\n\nGod\nMaterial/corporeal substance\nSome other created substance\n\n\nThat is, the cause is either infinite substance (God), or finite\nsubstance; and if finite, then either corporeal, or something else.\nDescartes thinks he eliminates options (a) and (c) by appeal to God\nbeing no deceiver:\n\nBut since God is not a deceiver, it is quite clear that he does not\ntransmit the ideas to me either directly from himself, or indirectly,\nvia some creature [other than corporeal substance] \u2026 For God\nhas given me no faculty at all for recognizing any such\nsource for these ideas; on the contrary, he has given me a great\npropensity to believe that they are produced by corporeal things.\nIt follows that corporeal things exist. (Med. 6, AT 7:79f, CSM 2:55;\nitalics added)\n\n\nThis is a problematic passage. The \u201cgreat propensity\u201d\nhere cited is not the irresistible compulsion of clear and distinct\nperception. (If it were, the conclusion that sensation is caused by\nmaterial objects would follow straightaway from this clear and\ndistinct perception, via the C&D Rule.) But unless each step of\nthe argument is clearly and distinctly perceived, Descartes should not\nbe making the argument. Adding to the difficulties of the passage, he\nexpressly cites the conclusion as following from the fact that\n\u201cGod is not a deceiver,\u201d implying that he thinks this\ninference is supported by a divine guarantee.\n\nOn one kind of interpretation, Descartes relaxes his epistemic\nstandards in the Sixth Meditation (cf. Schmitt 1986, 493f). He no\nlonger insists on perfect knowledge, now settling for probabilistic\narguments. Though no decisive texts support the interpretation, it\ndoes find some support. For instance, in the Synopsis to the\nMeditations, Descartes writes of his Sixth Meditation\narguments:\n\nThe great benefit of these arguments is not, in my view, that they\nprove what they establish \u2026 The point is that in considering\nthese arguments we come to realize that they are not as solid or as\ntransparent as the arguments which lead us to knowledge of our own\nminds and of God \u2026 (AT 7:15f, CSM 2:11)\n\n\nThe remark can be read as a concession that the Sixth Meditation\narguments are weaker than the earlier arguments about minds and God\n\u2013 that these later arguments do not \u201cprove what they\nestablish.\u201d Of course, one need not read the remark this way.\nAnd other texts are unfavorable to this interpretation. For example,\nin the opening paragraphs of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes considers\na probabilistic argument for the existence of external bodies. Though\nhe accepts the proposed account as offering the best explanation, he\nnonetheless dismisses it for the express reason that it grounds\n\u201conly a probability\u201d \u2013 it does not provide the\n\u201cbasis for a necessary inference that some body exists\u201d\n(AT 7:73, CSM 2:51). This is a puzzling dismissal, assuming Descartes\nhas relaxed his standards to probable inference.\n\nThe relaxed standards interpretation falls short for another reason.\nIt leaves unexplained why Descartes cites a divine guarantee for the\nconclusion that sensations are caused by material objects.\n\nOn another kind of interpretation, the troubling passage appealing to\na \u201cgreat propensity\u201d does not mark a relaxing of epistemic\nstandards. Instead, Descartes is extending the implications of his\ndiscussion of theodicy in the Fourth Meditation to encompass further\ncases of natural belief \u2013 such beliefs deriving from our\nGod-given cognitive nature. It was noted above\n (Section 5.2)\n that Descartes thinks the divine guarantee of the C&D Rule\nfollows, in part, from the fact that God wouldn\u2019t allow us to be\nmistaken when our assent is a natural consequence of our God-given\ncognitive nature. Suppose Descartes holds that there are further cases\nin which an all-perfect God would not allow us to be in error, in part\nbecause the beliefs in question arise naturally from our God-given\ncognitive nature. And suppose the further cases involve a\nnatural propensity to believe which cannot be\ncorrected by our cognitive faculties. Given these assumptions,\nthe resulting rule for truth would look something like the\nfollowing:\n\nI am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a natural propensity to\nbelieve, and (ii) God provided me no faculty by which to correct a\nfalse such belief.\n\n\nThis rule is more expansive than the C&D Rule, in that it\nlicenses more kinds of judgments. Clauses (i) and (ii) are tailored to\nthe problematic passage wherein, as we\u2019ve seen, Descartes\ninvokes two conditions: \u201cGod has given me no faculty at all\nfor recognizing any such source for these ideas; on the contrary,\nhe has given me a great propensity to believe that they are\nproduced by corporeal things.\u201d If this is on the right\ninterpretive track, then Descartes needs some way to justify this\nrule. Assuming a proof similar in structure to the proof of the\nC&D Rule, the justification might run as follows:\n\nThere is an all-perfect God.\nAn all-perfect God cannot allow me to be in error in cases in\nwhich (i) I have a natural propensity to believe, and (ii) God\nprovided me no faculty by which to correct a false such belief.\nTherefore, I am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a\nnatural propensity to believe, and (ii) God provided me no faculty\nby which to correct a false such belief.\n\n\nIf Descartes affirms premise 2, it explains why he thinks he\u2019s\nentitled to this more expansive rule, and without relaxing his\nepistemic standards. Indeed, a number of texts indicate that he\nholds some version of premise 2. The relevant Sixth Meditation\npassage states that from \u201cthe very fact that God is not a \ndeceiver\u201d there is a \u201cconsequent impossibility of there \nbeing any falsity in my opinions which cannot be corrected by some \nother faculty supplied by God\u201d (AT 7:80, CSM 2:55f). Another \npassage adds that we would be \u201cdoing God an injustice\u201d\nif we implied \u201cthat God had endowed us with such an imperfect \nnature that even the proper use of our powers of reasoning allowed\nus to go wrong\u201d (Prin. 3:43, AT 8a:99, CSM 1:255).\nAnd in the Second Replies, Descartes addresses case of judgments\nthat \u201ccould not be corrected by any clearer judgements or by \nmeans of any other natural faculty,\u201d adding that \u201cin\nsuch cases I simply assert that it is impossible for us to be \ndeceived\u201d (Replies 2, AT 7:143f, CSM 2:102f). These passages\nmake a strong case that something like premise 2 is in play,\nindeed implying that God\u2019s benevolent nature entails a more\nexpansive rule of truth than the C&D Rule. (As will emerge,\nDescartes looks again to call on this more expansive rule\nin his effort to prove that he is not dreaming.)\n\nEarlier, we noted another apparent problem in the Sixth Meditation\npassage wherein Descartes concludes that the external cause of\nsensation is something corporeal. One of his premises cites a\ngreat propensity to believe, yet the propensity is not\nitself the irresistible compulsion of clear and distinct perception. \nDoes not the methodic procedure of the Meditations restrict \nDescartes to using clear and distinct premises? By way of reply, \ndistinguish (a) that my sensation has an external cause, and (b)\nthat I have a great propensity to believe my sensation has\nan external cause. In context, the meditator lacks clear and distinct \nperception of (a). However, the relevant premise of the argument (as \nopposed to its conclusion) is not (a), but (b). And there is no \nprincipled reason that the meditator cannot clearly and distinctly \nperceive this premise.\n\nA final observation. It goes regularly unnoticed that the conclusion\nof Descartes\u2019 argument for the existence of an external material\nworld leaves significant scepticism in place. Granting the success of\nthe argument, my sensations are caused by an external material world.\nBut for all the argument shows \u2013 for all the broader argument of\nthe Meditations shows, up to this point \u2013 my mind might\nbe joined to a brain in a vat, rather than a full human body.\nThis isn\u2019t an oversight on Descartes\u2019 part. It\u2019s all\nhe thinks the argument can prove. For even at this late stage\nof the project, the meditator has not yet established himself to be\nawake \u2013 a line of inquiry to which we now turn.\n\n(For further discussion of Descartes\u2019 effort to prove the\nexistence of an external material world, see Carriero 2009 [146ff],\nFriedman 1997, Garber 1992, and Newman 1994.)\n8. Perfect Knowledge of Being Awake\n\nBy design, the constructive arguments of the Meditations\nunfold even though the meditator remains in doubt about being awake.\nThis of course reinforces the ongoing theme that perfect knowledge\ndoes not properly encompass judgments of external sense. (The judgment\nthat an external material world exists is not strictly a judgment of\nexternal sense \u2013 as if knowing its existence simply by sensing\nit. Rather, as we\u2019ve seen, the judgment arises from an complex\ninference about the possible causes of sensations.) In the closing\nparagraph of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes revisits the issue of\ndreaming. He claims to show how, in principle \u2013 even if not\neasily in practice \u2013 it is possible to achieve perfect knowledge\nthat one is presently awake.\n\nA casual reading of that final paragraph might suggest that Descartes\noffers a naturalistic solution to the problem (i.e., a\nnon-theistic solution), in the form of a continuity test: since\ncontinuity with past experiences holds only of waking but not\ndreaming, checking for the requisite continuity provides a test for\nascertaining that one is awake. The following remarks can be read in\nthis way:\n\nI now notice that there is a vast difference between the two\n[\u201cbeing asleep and being awake\u201d], in that dreams are never\nlinked by memory with all the other actions of life as waking\nexperiences are. \u2026 But when I distinctly see where things come\nfrom and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my\nperceptions of them with the whole of the rest of my life without a\nbreak, then I am quite certain that when I encounter these things I am\nnot asleep but awake. (AT 7:89f, CSM 2:61f)\n\n\nThis naturalistic \u201csolution\u201d prompts two obvious\ncriticisms, both raised by Hobbes in the Third Objections. First, the\nsolution runs contrary to Descartes\u2019 No Atheistic Perfect\nKnowledge Thesis: since the continuity test (on the naturalistic\nreading of it) does not invoke God, it thus appears, as Hobbes notes,\n\u201cthat someone can know he is awake without knowledge of\nthe true God\u201d (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Second, it seems that one\ncould dream the requisite continuity: one could \u201cdream\nthat his dream fits in with his ideas of a long series of past\nevents,\u201d thus undermining the credibility of the continuity test\n(AT 7:195, CSM 2:137).\n\nMirroring our discussion in\n Section 7.2,\n one kind of interpretation has Descartes relaxing his epistemic\nstandards. He\u2019s aware that the naturalistic solution does not\nstand up to methodic doubt, but he\u2019s not attempting to overcome\nthe Now Dreaming Doubt with perfect knowledge. A problem for this\ninterpretation is that it doesn\u2019t square with the following\nreply Descartes makes to Hobbes\u2019 first objection: \u201can\natheist can infer that he is awake on the basis of memory of his past\nlife\u201d (via the continuity test); but \u201che cannot know that\nthis criterion is sufficient to give him the certainty that he is not\nmistaken, if he does not know that he was created by a non-deceiving\nGod\u201d (Replies 3, AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Evidently,\nDescartes\u2019 solution is not supposed to be available to the\natheist. Taken at face value, this reply rules out a relaxed standards\ninterpretation; it indeed rules out any interpretation involving a\nnaturalistic solution to the problem of dreaming.\n\nOn closer inspection, the Sixth Meditation passage puts forward not a\nnaturalistic solution, but a theistic one. The meditator\nfinally concludes that he\u2019s awake because, as the passage\nexplicitly reads, \u201cGod is not a deceiver\u201d (AT 7:90, CSM\n2:62).\n\nHow does his argument go? Recall, in the proof of the external\nmaterial world\n (Section 7.2),\n that Descartes mysteriously invokes the following (divinely\nguaranteed) truth rule:\n\nI am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a natural propensity to\nbelieve, and (ii) God provided me no faculty by which to correct a\nfalse such belief.\n\n\nThe dreaming passage looks to have Descartes again invoking this rule.\nThe passage opens with the meditator observing the following:\n\nI can almost always make use of more than one sense to investigate the\nsame thing; and in addition, I can use both my memory, which connects\npresent experiences with preceding ones, and my intellect, which has\nby now examined all the causes of error. Accordingly, I should not\nhave any further fears about the falsity of what my senses tell me\nevery day; on the contrary, the exaggerated doubts of the last few\ndays should be dismissed as laughable. This applies especially to\n\u2026 my inability to distinguish between being asleep and being\nawake. (AT 7:89, CSM 2:61)\n\n\nReferring to the worry that he\u2019s presently dreaming as\nexaggerated suggests that condition (i) is met \u2013 i.e.,\nsuggesting that the present circumstance includes a \u201cnatural\npropensity\u201d to believe he\u2019s awake. As such, he needs only\nto establish condition (ii), and he\u2019ll have a divine guarantee\nof being awake. Here, notice that an important theme of the above\npassage concerns the meditator\u2019s faculties for correcting\nsensory error \u2013 a theme suggestive of condition (ii). In\ncontext, Descartes\u2019 appeal to the continuity test is perhaps\nbest understood in conjunction with condition (ii). As the meditator\nsays (speaking of his apparently waking experience):\n\n[W]hen I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they\ncome to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with the\nwhole of the rest of my life without a break, then I am quite certain\nthat when I encounter these things I am not asleep but awake. And I\nought not to have even the slightest doubt of their reality if,\nafter calling upon all the senses as well as my memory and my\nintellect in order to check them, I receive no conflicting reports\nfrom any of these sources. For from the fact that God is not\na deceiver it follows that in cases like these I am\ncompletely free from error. (AT 7:90, CSM 2:62; italics added)\n\n\nCentral to the inference is the meditator\u2019s effort to check the\ncorrectness of his belief, by means of his various faculties. The\ncases like these to which Descartes refers look to be those\nwhere conditions (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. Recall what\nDescartes writes in conjunction with the proof of the external\nmaterial world: from \u201cthe very fact that God is not a\ndeceiver\u201d there is a \u201cconsequent impossibility of there\nbeing any falsity in my opinions which cannot be corrected by some\nother faculty supplied by God\u201d (AT 7:80, CSM 2:55f). Perhaps,\ntherefore, we can understand Descartes\u2019 theistic solution to the\nNow Dreaming Doubt as building on the same rule he employs in\nhis proof for the external material world.\n\nWhat about Hobbes\u2019s other objection \u2013 in effect, that one\ncould dream both (i) and (ii)? Descartes\u2019 response:\n\u201cA dreamer cannot really connect his dreams with the ideas of\npast events, though he may dream that he does. For everyone admits\nthat a man may be deceived in his sleep\u201d (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137).\nPerhaps Descartes thinks the situation with dreaming parallels that of\nwaking life: those who are sufficiently tired, or otherwise\nperceptually inattentive, \u201ccannot really\u201d perceive truths\nclearly and distinctly, though it may seem to them that they\ndo. Whether in waking or dreaming, the Fourth Meditation theodicy has\nGod allowing us to make judgment errors, provided that they are\ncorrectable. Descartes is committed to holding that when our\nperception is confused, we can in principle come to discover the\nconfusion \u2013 even if not easily. When we lack clear and distinct\nperception, we are at fault (not God) for any resulting judgments, in\npart because we can discover that our perception is confused.\nDescartes needs it that the same principle holds even while dreaming.\n(And again, nearly the entirety of the Meditations unfolds\nunder the supposition that, for all we know, we may presently be\ndreaming.) For the case at hand \u2013 i.e., the possibility of\nmistakenly judging that I\u2019m awake, while in a dream\n\u2013 Descartes needs it that we could, in principle, discover that\nwe\u2019re mistaken. Apropos of condition (ii), therefore, is whether\nGod has provided us a faculty by which to discover that we\u2019re\ndreaming, on occasions when we wrongly believe ourselves to be awake.\nEvidently, Descartes thinks so, as he tells Gassendi:\n\nWhen, for example, we are asleep and are aware that we are dreaming,\nwe need imagination in order to dream, but to be aware that we are\ndreaming we need only the intellect. (Replies 5, AT 7:358f, CSM 2:248)\n\n\nImportantly, Descartes does not say we can easily correct the\nmistake of dreaming that we\u2019re awake. To the contrary,\nthe Sixth Meditation treatment of the Now Dreaming Doubt closes with a\nconcession that his solution is perhaps more theoretical than\npractical:\n\nBut since the pressure of things to be done does not always allow us\nto stop and make such a meticulous check, it must be admitted that in\nthis human life we are often liable to make mistakes about particular\nthings, and we must acknowledge the weakness of our nature. (AT 7:90,\nCSM 2:62)\n\n\nThus the importance of Descartes\u2019 First Meditation remark that\n\u201cno danger or error will result\u201d from the program of\nmethodical doubt, \u201cbecause the task now in hand does not involve\naction\u201d (AT 7:22, CSM 2:15). Methodical doubt should not be\napplied to practical matters. Prudence dictates that when making\npractical decisions I should assume I\u2019m awake, even if I\ndon\u2019t perfectly know that I\u2019m awake. Judgment errors made\nwhile mistakenly assuming I\u2019m awake do not have\nactual practical consequences, unlike those made while mistakenly\nassuming I\u2019m dreaming.\n\n(For further discussion, see Newman 1999, Williams 1978, and\nWilson 1978.)\n9. Self-Knowledge\n9.1 That Mind is Better-Known than Body\n\nDescartes holds that our judgments about our own minds are\nepistemically better-off than our judgments about bodies. In our\nnatural, pre-reflective condition, however, we\u2019re apt to confuse\nthe sensory images of bodies with the external things themselves, a\nconfusion leading us to think our judgments about bodies are\nepistemically impressive. The confusion is clearly expressed\n(Descartes would say) in G. E. Moore\u2019s famous claim to knowledge\n\u2013 \u201cHere is a hand\u201d \u2013 along with his more\ngeneral defense of common sense:\n\nI begin, then, with my list of truisms, every one of which (in my own\nopinion) I know, with certainty, to be true. \u2026 There\nexists at present a living human body, which is my body. This\nbody was born at a certain time in the past, and has existed\ncontinuously ever since \u2026 But the earth had existed also for\nmany years before my body was born \u2026 (1962, 32f)\n\n\nIn contrast, Descartes writes:\n\n[I]f I judge that the earth exists from the fact that I touch it or\nsee it, this very fact undoubtedly gives even greater support for the\njudgement that my mind exists. For it may perhaps be the case that I\njudge that I am touching the earth even though the earth does not\nexist at all; but it cannot be that, when I make this judgement, my\nmind which is making the judgement does not exist. (Prin.\n1:11, AT 8a:8f, CSM 1:196)\n\n\nMethodical doubt is intended to help us appreciate the folly of the\ncommonsensical position \u2013 helping us recognize that perception\nof our own minds is \u201cnot simply prior to and more certain\n\u2026 but also more evident\u201d than perception of our own\nbodies (Prin. 1:11, AT 8a:8, CSM 1:196). \u201cDisagreement\non this point,\u201d writes Descartes, comes from \u201cthose who\nhave not done their philosophizing in an orderly way\u201d; from\nthose who, while properly acknowledging the \u201ccertainty of their\nown existence,\u201d mistakenly \u201ctake \u2018themselves\u2019\nto mean only their bodies\u201d \u2013 failing to \u201crealize\nthat they should have taken \u2018themselves\u2019 in this context\nto mean their minds alone\u201d (Prin. 1:12, AT 8a:9, CSM\n1:196).\n\nIn epistemological contexts, Descartes purports to establish the\nmind-better-known-than-body doctrine with methodical doubt. For\nexample, while reflecting on his epistemic position in regard both to\nhimself, and to the wax, the Second Meditation meditator says: \n\nSurely my awareness of my own self is not merely much truer and more\ncertain than my awareness of the wax, but also much more distinct and\nevident. For if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I see\nit, clearly this same fact entails much more evidently that I myself\nalso exist. It is possible that what I see is not really the wax; it\nis possible that I do not even have eyes with which to see anything.\nBut when I see, or think I see (I am not here distinguishing the two),\nit is simply not possible that I who am now thinking am not something.\n(AT 7:33, CSM 2:22)\n\n\nFurther reasons might be helping to motivate Descartes\u2019 view.\nOn the kind of representational theory of perception that is widely \nattributed to him, our sense organs and nerves serve as literal mediating links in the causal chains generating sense perception:\nthey stand between (both spatially and causally) external things themselves, and the brain events occasioning our perceptual\nawareness (cf. Prin. 4:196). In veridical sensation, the \nobjects of immediate sensory awareness are not external bodies \nthemselves, nor are we immediately aware of the states of our sense \norgans or nerves. Rather, the objects of immediate awareness are \n\u2013 whether in veridical sensation, or in dreams \u2013 the \nmind\u2019s own ideas. Descartes indeed holds that the\nfact of physiological mediation helps explain delusional ideas,\nbecause roughly the same kinds of physiological processes that\nproduce waking ideas are employed in producing delusional ideas:\n\n[I]t is the soul which sees, and not the eye; and it does not see\ndirectly, but only by means of the brain. That is why madmen and those\nwho are asleep often see, or think they see, various objects which are\nnevertheless not before their eyes: namely, certain vapours disturb\ntheir brain and arrange those of its parts normally engaged in vision\nexactly as they would be if these objects were present.\n(Optics, AT 6:141, CSM 1:172; cf. AT 7:85ff and AT 11:248f)\n\n\nVarious passages of the Meditations lay important groundwork\nfor this theory of perception. For instance, one of the messages of\nthe wax passage is that sensory awareness does not reach to external\nthings themselves: \n\nWe say that we see the wax itself, if it is there before us, not that\nwe judge it to be there from its colour or shape; and this might lead\nme to conclude without more ado that knowledge of the wax comes from\nwhat the eye sees, and not from the scrutiny of the mind alone. But\nthen if I look out of the window and see men crossing the square, as I\njust happen to have done, I normally say that I see the men\nthemselves, just as I say that I see the wax. Yet do I see any more\nthan hats and coats which could conceal automatons? I judge\nthat they are men. (Med. 2, AT 7:32, CSM 2:21)\n\n\nDescartes thinks we\u2019re apt to be \u201ctricked by ordinary\nways of talking\u201d (ibid.). In ordinary contexts we \ndon\u2019t say that it seems there are men outside the \nwindow; we say that we see them. Nor, in such contexts,\nare our beliefs about those men apt to result from conscious, \ninferentially complex judgments, say, like this one: \u201cWell,\nI appear to be awake, and the window pane looks clean, and \nthere\u2019s plenty of light outside, and so on, and I thus\nconclude that I am seeing men outside the window.\u201d Even\nso, our ordinary ways of speaking and thinking often mislead. \nDescartes\u2019 view is that the mind\u2019s immediate perception \ndoes not, strictly speaking, extend beyond itself, to external\nbodies. This is an important basis of the mind-better-known-than-body \ndoctrine. In the concluding paragraph of the Second Meditation, \nDescartes writes:\n\nI see that without any effort I have now finally got back to\nwhere I wanted. I now know that even bodies are not strictly\n[proprie] perceived by the senses or the faculty of\nimagination but by the intellect alone, and that this perception\nderives not from their being touched or seen but from their being\nunderstood; and in view of this I know plainly that I can achieve an\neasier and more evident perception of my own mind than of anything\nelse. (AT 7:34, CSM 2:22f)\n\n\nThe understanding of ideas as the only immediate objects of\nawareness arises in a number of texts. In the Sixth Meditation,\nwhile discussing sense perception and our ideas of external things, \nDescartes writes that the mind\u2019s sensation extends strictly\nand immediately only to the ideas: \u201cthe ideas were, strictly \nspeaking, the only immediate objects of my sensory awareness\n[solas proprie et immediate sentiebam]\u201d (AT 7:75,\nCSM 2:52). The Second Replies defines thought \u201cto \ninclude everything that is within us in such a way that we are \nimmediately aware of it\u201d; it defines idea in\nterms of the \u201cimmediate perception\u201d that makes us \n\u201caware of the thought\u201d (AT 7:160, CSM 2:113). And\nin the Third Replies Descartes writes: \u201cI make it quite\nclear in several places \u2026 that I am taking the word \n\u2018idea\u2019 to refer to whatever is immediately perceived\nby the mind\u201d (AT 7:181, CSM 2:127).\n\nComplicating an understanding of such passages is that Descartes\nscholarship is divided on whether to attribute to him some version of\nan indirect theory of perception, or instead some version of a direct\ntheory. According to indirect perception accounts, in normal sensation\nthe mind\u2019s perception of bodies is mediated by an awareness of\nits ideas of those bodies. By contrast, direct perception\ninterpretations allow that in normal sensation the mind\u2019s ideas\nplay a mediating role, though this role doesn\u2019t have ideas\nfunctioning as items of awareness; rather, the objects of direct\nawareness are the external things, themselves. On both accounts, ideas\nmediate our perception of external objects. On direct theory accounts,\nthe mediating role is only a process role. By analogy, various brain\nprocesses mediate our perception of external objects, but in the\nnormal course of perception we are not consciously aware of\nthose processes; and likewise for the mind\u2019s ideas,\naccording to direct perception accounts. On one recent version of an\nindirect perception interpretation, sensory ideas mediate our\nperception of the external bodies they\u2019re of, in much the same\nway that pictures (or other representational media) mediate our\nperception of what they portray (Newman 2009). More generally,\nDescartes seems to view all ideas as mental pictures, of a sort. As he\nwrites: \u201cthe term \u2018idea\u2019 is strictly\nappropriate\u201d only for thoughts that \u201care as it were the\nimages of things\u201d (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:25); he adds that\n\u201cthe ideas in me are like {pictures, or} images\u201d (Med. 3,\nAT 7:42, CSM 2:29). \n\nIndirect perception interpretations have figured prominently in the\nhistory of Descartes scholarship. A number of recent commentators,\nhowever, have challenged this traditional view. For example,\nCarriero defends a direct perception interpretation: \u201cI don\u2019t read Descartes as holding that I am (immediately)\naware only of my sensory ideas and only subsequently (and perhaps \nindirectly) aware of bodies or their qualities\u201d (2009, 25).\nThus on Carriero\u2019s reading, Descartes\u2019 broader argument \nrebutting our doubts about the external world is not to be understood \nas an effort to get on the other side (as it were) of our ideas:\n\nThe argument (as I understand it) is not intended to get us from a\nrealm of inner mental objects (\u201csensory ideas\u201d) to some\nother realm of outer, physical objects (\u201cbodies\u201d); rather,\nit is to confirm our instinctive feeling that we have been receiving\ninformation (\u201cdirectly\u201d) from outer objects, bodies, all\nalong. (2009, 26)\n\n\n(For further discussion of Descartes\u2019 theory of ideas and\nperception, see Carriero 2009, Chappell 1986, Cunning 2010,\nHoffman 1996 and 2009, Jolley 1990, Nadler 2006, Nelson 1997, \nNewman 2009, 2011, and Smith 2014.)\n9.2 Whether We Perfectly Know Our Own Minds\n\nWe have seen that the proper use of our cognitive faculties requires\nus to withhold assent except when our perception is clear and distinct\n\u2013 indeed, that forming judgments in accord with the C&D Rule\nprovides the only guarantee of truth. Let\u2019s apply this standard\nto introspective judgments. Suppose that the present contents of my \nmind include a confused array of ideas \u2013 say, a confused \nassemblage of auditory ideas, or color ideas, or perhaps I am\npresently flooded with a confused assortment of ideas of emotion.\nIn such cases, the proper use of my faculties requires me to withhold \njudgment about the present state of my mind.\n\nIt is surprising, therefore, to learn that on the standard view in\nDescartes scholarship, he holds a strong view of privileged access\nguaranteeing the truth of all introspective judgments about\nthe present contents of our own minds. The usual result is an\ninfallibility thesis whereby judgments about our own mental states\ncannot be mistaken if based on introspective awareness: if\nI seem to be in mental state x, then I am\nin x. (A variety of related doctrines are also sometimes\nattributed to him, including the indubitability of the mental\n\u2013 roughly, that introspective judgments are indubitable;\nand omniscience with respect to the mental \u2013 roughly,\nthat one has knowledge of every true proposition about one\u2019s own\npresent contents of consciousness. There is some variation in the way\nthese doctrines are formulated in the literature.)\n\nAt least two lines of argument are widely cited in support of this\nstandard interpretation. One draws on the transparency doctrine. The\nother draws on texts interpreted as providing support. Let\u2019s \nexamine both.\n\nThe transparency doctrine has it that we are aware of everything\noccurring in our minds \u2013 this, a result of Descartes\u2019 view\nthat thinking constitutes the whole essence of\nmind:\n\nAs to the fact that there can be nothing in the mind, in so far as it\nis a thinking thing, of which it is not aware, this seems to me to be\nself-evident. For there is nothing that we can understand to be in the\nmind, regarded in this way, that is not a thought or dependent on a\nthought. \u2026 and we cannot have any thought of which we are not\naware at the very moment when it is in us. (Replies 4, AT 7:246, CSM\n2:171f)\n\n\nAdd to this that, unlike with external sensation, there is no\nintrospective appearance/reality gap, and there can seem to be no room\nfor introspective errors. Zeno Vendler explains:\n\nIf the mind, at any given time, is identical with a certain complex of\nthoughts \u2026 then the very idea of a medium between the\nmind and its thoughts is impossible from the outset. Accordingly, it\nis an understatement to say that the mind knows its thoughts;\nthe mind is these thoughts. (1972, 191)\n\n\nKenny adds:\n\nThe occurrence of thoughts is not open to doubt or error. Thoughts\ncannot occur without our knowing that they occur, and we cannot think\nthat a thought is occurring unless that thought actually is occurring.\n(1968, 72)\n\n\nIn opposition to this standard interpretation, note that from the\nfact that I have awareness of whatever is occurring in my mind, it\ndoes not follow that I have distinct awareness. If\nwhat\u2019s occurring in my mind is a confused muddle of ideas, then\nI\u2019ll be aware of a confused muddle of ideas. But in that case,\nforming a judgment about the present state of my mind is a recipe for\nerror \u2013 i.e., given the Fourth Meditation account of proper\njudgment. The situation is arguably better in cases in which I\nam experiencing fewer and simpler ideas; this is because such ideas\nare generally easier to render clear and distinct. Even so, such\nideas must actually be rendered as clear and distinct.\nNoteworthy is that Descartes writes, of \u201csensations, emotions\nand appetites,\u201d that \u201cwe are frequently wrong in our \njudgements concerning them\u201d; adding, that we can avoid such\nerrors \u201cprovided we take great care in our judgements\nconcerning them to include no more than what is strictly contained\nin our perception \u2013 no more than that of which we have inner\nawareness\u201d (Prin 1:66, AT 8a:32, CSM 1:216).\n\nConsider another case that seems at odds with the standard\ninterpretation. Were Descartes committed to introspective\ninfallibility, then he should say that we could never\nbe mistaken as to whether our occurring ideas are ideas of\nsensation, or instead ideas of imagination\noccurring in a dream. Yet as we\u2019ve seen, he takes\ndreaming-based scepticism utterly seriously.\n\nWhat about the textual line of argument regularly cited in support\nof the standard interpretation? Consider two Meditations\npassages that can seem to entail the infallibility thesis:\n\n\nI certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed. This\ncannot be false; what is called \u201chaving a sensory\nperception\u201d is strictly just this, and in this restricted sense\nof the term it is simply thinking. (Med. 2, AT 7:29, CSM 2:19)\n\nNow as far as ideas are concerned, provided they are considered solely\nin themselves and I do not refer them to anything else, they cannot\nstrictly speaking be false; for whether it is a goat or a chimera that\nI am imagining, it is just as true that I imagine the former as the\nlatter. As for the will and the emotions, here too one need not worry\nabout falsity; for even if the things which I may desire are wicked or\neven non-existent, that does not make it any less true that I desire\nthem. (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:26)\n\n\nPrima facie, it is plausible to take such passages to entail that if\nI seem to be having an idea of blue, or an idea of a noise,\nor of warmth, etc., then I am. Indeed, one might take such\npassages to convey that judgments to this effect \u201ccannot be\nfalse\u201d because introspective judgments are infallible.\nBut note the continuation of the second passage: \u201cThus the only\nremaining thoughts where I must be on my guard against making a\nmistake are judgements.\u201d This suggests that these passages can\nbe read in a very different way. Accordingly, a mere seeming\n\u201ccannot be false\u201d because it is not the kind of mental\nstate that could be false; on Descartes\u2019 view,\nfalsity arises not simply from the mind\u2019s awareness\nof its ideas, but from judgments \u2013 i.e., from acts of will \nassenting to those items of awareness. Read in this way, these\npassages anticipate the Fourth Meditation theory of judgment:\n\nNow all that the intellect does is to enable me to perceive the ideas\nwhich are subjects for possible judgements; and when regarded strictly\nin this light, it turns out to contain no error in the proper sense of\nthat term. (AT 7:56, CSM 2:39)\n\n\nArguably, Descartes\u2019 mind-better-known-than-body\ndoctrine is intended as a comparative rather than a\nsuperlative thesis. We have seen that, for Descartes, the\nonly superlative perceptual state is that of clarity and distinctness.\nThis suggests that the only guarantee of truth in our introspective \njudgments is, like all other judgments, that they be based on clear \nand distinct perception: if I clearly and distinctly perceive myself\nto be in mental state x, then I am in x.\n\n(For further discussion of related issues in Descartes, see Alanen \n2003, Broughton 2008, Curley 2006, Jolley 2013, Kenny 1968,\nLoLordo 2005, McRae 1972, Newman 2023, Nolan & Whipple 2005,\nVendler 1972, and Wilson 1978.)\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<p>\nAbbreviations Used:</p>\n<table class=\"cellpad-small-dense vert-top cell-rl\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>", "<em>Rules</em>", "=", "<em>Rules for the Direction of our Native Intelligence</em>\n</tr>\n<tr>", "<em>Discourse</em>", "=", "<em>Discourse on Method</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "Synopsis", "=", "Synopsis of the <em>Meditations</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "<em>Meditations</em>", "=", "<em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "Med.", "=", "any one of the six <em>Meditations</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "Objs./Replies", "=", "any of the seven sets of objections/replies that\nDescartes published along with the <em>Meditations</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "<em>Prin.</em>", "=", "<em>Principles of Philosophy</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "<em>Passions</em>", "=", "<em>The Passions of the Soul</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "<em>Search</em>", "=", "<em>The Search for Truth</em> </tr>\n<tr>", "AT", "=", "<em>Oeuvres de Descartes</em>, Adam, Charles, and\nPaul Tannery (eds.), 1904.
