    "main_text": "Classical Theories of the Doctrine of Atonement || Three Motifs\n4.2 Three Motifs\n4.2.1 The Recapitulation Motif\n\nIrenaeus, an early Church father, is famous for saying that\nChrist\u2019s entire life and death recapitulate what Adam has done\nto spread sin in humanity. Adam is not just an individual, but a\nrepresentative for humanity who has set humanity on the course of sin.\nChrist is viewed as the new Adam, who reverses what Adam did for\nhumanity. Recapitulation aims at restoring humanity to how it was\nmeant to be. It does this by summing up in Christ\u2019s life the\nsort of obstacles humans have faced, but reversing what humanity,\nfollowing Adam, has done in the face of those obstacles (Turner 1952).\nWhere humanity sinned and was disobedient, Christ was sinless and\nobedient. Irenaeus uses this theme to explain in granular detail some\nof the specific events of Christ\u2019s life. For instance, because\nAdam committed the first sin in regard to a tree, Christ needs to\nfinally defeat sin in obedience in regard to a tree\u2014i.e., by\nhanging on the cross (AH V.16.2).\n\nRecapitulation, if seen as a requirement for how sin must be defeated,\nprovides an additional tool to use to explain why Christ\u2019s life\ntook the particular shape it did. Of course, the main question it\nfaces is this: why should recapitulation provide strictures as to how\nsin is defeated? (Rashdall 1920: 233ff) One answer is that there is a\ncertain sort of beauty to the structure (McNall 2019: 34). Another is\nthat if Christ is to operate as a representative for humanity in\ncombatting evil, he should in his actions sum up the full range of\nhumanity\u2019s experience with evil and counteract it (McNall 2019:\n40).\n4.2.2 The Divinization/Healing Motif\n\nMany of the early Greek Church fathers\u2014including Gregory of\nNazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Athanasius\u2014emphasize this motif\n(although it is also found in the Latin tradition). Athanasius states\nit simply: \u201cHe [i.e., Christ, the word of God]\u2026assumed\nhumanity that we might become God\u201d (On the Incarnation\n[1993: 93]). God the Son assumes a human nature to divinize\nit\u2014to restore the image of God in humanity that has been\ntarnished by sin and to heal our nature that had become sick and\nsubject to corruption. Humans cannot cure themselves of the problem\nwith their nature, and so the cure must come from a divine source that\nunites with their human nature, \u201cfor a sick man cannot be healed\nunless the ailing part of him in particular receives the cure\u201d\n(Gregory of Nyssa An Address [1954: 305]). The cure includes\nsaving humans from death, which Christ accomplishes through his own\ndeath (Myers 2015).\n\nThis motif is used to explain why God became incarnate, and it implies\nthat all of Christ\u2019s life plays some role in healing human\nnature. And since healing human nature is needed for reconciliation\nwith God, and thus for atonement, mere repentance is not sufficient\n(Athanasius On the Incarnation [1993: 33]) for atonement.\n\nThe main question for this motif is: how does the incarnation of the\nSon of God bring about divinization/healing of humans? The usual\nanswer appeals to the solidarity of humankind together with the Son of\nGod\u2019s ability, like Adam, to affect all of humanity through his\nactions (De Lubac 1947 [1988]; Mersch 1933/1938 [2011]). All of\nhumanity exists in a union of sorts, constituting \u201ca single\nliving organism\u201d (Gregory of Nyssa An Address [1954:\n310]). By uniting himself with this organism, God the Son\u2014who\nbecomes the Head of humanity\u2014can convey his renewed human nature\nto other humans in the organism, thus healing\n them.[34]\n4.2.3 Vicarious Substitute/Representative Motif\n\nThis motif, rooted in the Christian scriptures, is common throughout\nthe history of Christian thought (Gathercole 2015; Bynum 2004). This\nmotif is often combined with seeing Christ\u2019s atoning\nwork\u2014especially his death\u2014as a sacrifice. Sometimes\nChrist\u2019s atoning work is understood as substitutionary: he does\nit instead of those who ought to have done it (or something\nequivalent), releasing them of any obligation to do it. Athanasius,\nfor example, says that humans have a debt that needs to be paid due to\nsin\u2014a debt of death\u2014and Christ becomes \u201cin dying a\nsufficient exchange for all\u201d (On the Incarnation [1993:\n35]). Christ\u2019s atoning work is also sometimes regarded as\nrepresentative: he represents humans, and so what he does to atone\ncounts as what we humans need to do to atone. The divinization/healing\nmotif is often coupled with seeing Christ as a representative.\n\nThe main challenge for this motif is to explain how Christ is a\nsubstitute or a representative and, as such, how his atoning work can\nremove the need or duty for non-divine humans to atone for their sin.\nEach theory that incorporates this motif\u2014and most theories do,\none way or another\u2014replies to this challenge differently.\n4.3 Anselm\u2019s Satisfaction Theory\n\nAnselm\u2019s satisfaction theory in Curs Deus Homo (abbr.\nCDH as noted above) is the most influential account of the\nChristian doctrine of atonement. Nearly everything written since\ndefines itself as a defense, development, or rejection of (and\nalternative to) Anselm\u2019s theory.\n\nAnselm\u2019s argument in CDH moves through four steps\n(Thurow 2017b: 433).\n\nStep 1:\nIn order to be saved, humans must offer satisfaction to God for\nwhat they have taken from God in sinning against him.\nStep 2:\nOnly God incarnated as a human descendant of Adam will be able to\noffer adequate satisfaction for human sin.\nStep 3:\nAt least some humans will be saved.\nStep 4:\nBy dying in service of God, God incarnate provides an adequate and\nmost fitting satisfaction for human sin.\n\n\nSteps 1, 2, and 4 give us the heart of Anselm\u2019s theory of\n atonement.[35]\n\nStep 1\n is supported as follows (see CDH I.10\u201314,19,22,24).\nHumans have sinned and sin dishonors God. A just God cannot tolerate\nthe injustice of dishonor, and so sinners must either offer\nsatisfaction that adequately compensates for the dishonor done to God,\nor suffer punishment. But the punishment due for sin against God is\neternal death. Thus, if humans are to be saved from eternal death,\nthey must instead offer adequate satisfaction.\n\nIn support of\n step 2,\n Anselm argues (in short) that humans are so mired in sin, and the\ndisvalue of sin is so great because of God\u2019s nature, that no\nnon-divine human can offer adequate\n satisfaction.[36]\n However, it is \u201cnecessary that the person paying recompense\nshould be identical with the sinner, or a member of the same\nrace\u201d (CDH II.8 [1998: 321]). God\u2014being divine,\nmorally perfect, and having no debt of sin\u2014could offer adequate\nsatisfaction. Thus, adequate satisfaction can only be offered by a\nhuman descendant of Adam who is also God\u2014i.e., God\nincarnate.\n\nFor\n step 4,\n Anselm argues that whatever God incarnate does to satisfy for human\nsin must be supererogatory. Living a perfect life is required of all,\nincluding Christ. But dying in service of God is supererogatory and,\nbecause of the value of God himself, has far greater value than does\nthe debt of human sin (CDH II.10\u201311, 14\u201315).\nFurthermore, this satisfaction is fitting in other ways: it involves\npain (CDH II.11), which counters the pleasure of sin, it\ndecisively conquers Satan (CDH I.22\u201323), and it is a\nbetter example of service to God than one that does not involve his\ndeath (CDH II.18). Anselm here weaves in elements of\nrecapitulation, ransom, and moral influence views. Since God incarnate\nperformed a great act of supererogation for God the Father, he is owed\ncompensation. God incarnate desires the merit of his supererogatory\nact be used as satisfaction for human sin.\n\nAnselm\u2019s satisfaction theory has been criticized on several\ngrounds. Some criticisms conflate the satisfaction theory with penal\nsubstitution and reject both for problems leveled chiefly at penal\nsubstitution (Gorringe 1996, for example). However, Anselm\u2019s\ntheory is notable for saying that God precisely does not punish humans\nfor their sin. Rather, punishment is avoided by Christ\u2019s\nsatisfaction for human sin.\n\nMany object that Anselm\u2019s notion of honor is at heart a feudal\nnotion, both foreign to the Biblical context and not one that we\nshould attribute to God (see Whidden 2011 for\n examples).[37]\n Others have contested this charge, arguing that Anselm\u2019s notion\nof satisfaction has far older roots not connected with feudalism\n(Anderson 2009; Crisp 2020a: 71; Mansini 1987; Whidden 2011) and that\nit fits into his broader metaphysical notion of rectitude\u2014things\nbeing as they should, as rightly ordered, or as morally ordered by God\n(R. Campbell 1998; McGrath 1981).\n\nThe theologian Faustus Socinus is famous for leveling a series of\nobjections against objective theories of the atonement (Grensted\n1920). Two of those objections target satisfaction views specifically.\nFirst, if satisfaction is made for sin, then God does not pardon or\nforgive. But scripture plainly asserts that God forgives humans for\nsin, thus the satisfaction view must be false. This objection,\nhowever, depends upon the debt-canceling view of forgiveness, which\nhas been contested (Pettigrove 2012) and conflicts with other views of\nforgiveness described in\n section 1.3.2.\n Second, Socinus argues that Anselm\u2019s allowance of someone of\nthe same race to make satisfaction for human sin is unmotivated and\ncontrary to our moral standards\u2014the sinner and the sinner alone\nshould pay the price. However, given that for Anselm the\n\u201cprice\u201d seems to be reparative, people other than the\nsinner can help atone by helping repair its harmful effects (Purtill\n1990).\n\nScotus objects to Anselm\u2019s calculation of the infinite debt\nresulting from sin against God. He argues that sin produces a finite\ndebt arising from loving or pursuing a finite thing improperly. Humans\ncan perform supererogatory acts, which they can use as satisfaction to\npay this finite debt (see Burns 1975).\n\nCross (2001) argues that sin against God, when it does not have other\nharmful consequences, is a deprivation of service and one only need\ngenuinely apologize and repent to atone in such cases. One must repair\nharmful consequences to humans, but beyond that no further reparation\nis owed to\n God.[38]\n\nStump (2018) objects that Anselm (and many other views) regards\nGod\u2019s forgiveness as conditional upon and responsive to\nChrist\u2019s satisfaction for human sin. This, she claims, is\ncontrary to God\u2019s love, which entails unconditional and\nunilateral forgiveness. Some have objected to Stump\u2019s view of\nGod\u2019s love and forgiveness (Craig 2019; J. Rutledge 2022;\nSwinburne 2019; Thurow & Strabbing 2020; Warmke 2019). Thurow and\nStrabbing (2020) argue that Anselm\u2019s notion of forgiveness is\ndifferent from Stump\u2019s and, in any case, Anselm is more\nconcerned to argue that reconciliation is conditional upon\nsatisfaction.\n\nLombardo (2013) objects that Anselm is committed to saying that God\nwills Christ\u2019s death and the moral evil that causes his death,\nneither of which a good God would do. Anselm tries to dodge this\nconcern in CDH, however Lombardo argues that his attempts all\nfail; they either render his view unable to explain why God became\nhuman or result in a tension within the Trinity.\n\nLastly, many have criticized Anselm\u2019s view for not accounting\nfor how humans are to respond to and adopt Christ\u2019s atoning work\nfor themselves (e.g., Grensted 1920; Crisp 2020a). However, this\nlacuna may be due to the narrow goal of the CDH; Anselm\nelsewhere shows deep sensitivity to the importance of human repentance\nand faith in becoming reconciled to God (Thurow & Strabbing\n 2020).[39]\n\nContemporary defenses of Anselm\u2019s view, or modified\nsatisfactions views, can be found in Anderson 2009; Aspenson 1990;\nFarris & Hamilton 2018; Rogers 2001; Shannon 2009; Sonderegger\n2017 and perhaps most prominently in the work of Richard Swinburne,\nwhich will be discussed in\n section 5.2.\n4.4 Penal Substitution\n\nPenal substitution has been defended by many in the Reformed and more\nbroadly evangelical tradition. It has strong roots in Luther and\nCalvin; there has been considerable debate about whether there are\nearlier\n precursors.[40]\n On this view Christ, instead of paying satisfaction for human sin,\nsuffers punishment on behalf of humans for human sin. God\u2019s\njustice is thus satisfied, enabling God and humans to be reconciled\n(Schreiner 2006a).\n\nWilliam Lane Craig, however, defines the view more broadly\n\n\nas the doctrine that God inflicted upon Christ the suffering that we\ndeserved as the punishment for our sins, as a result of which we no\nlonger deserve punishment. (2020: 147)\n\n\nOn this definition one could hold that Christ was not punished; he\nmerely experienced sufferings that would have constituted punishment\nif we mere humans had endured them. Somehow, though, in virtue of his\nenduring these sufferings, \u201cwe no longer deserve\npunishment\u201d. How could that be? One option is to say that we\nmere humans are punished through Christ enduring these sufferings. M.\nMurphy (2009) calls this a \u201cvicarious punishment\u201d view,\nwhich he distinguishes from penal substitution. A second option is to\nsay that the debt of punishment is a collective debt humanity owes to\nGod and that Christ, through his death, pays it on behalf of the human\ncommunity. Humanity is punished, but Christ is not, on this view\n(Thurow 2015). A third option is to say that nobody is punished. Hard\ntreatment can be endured by an innocent third party\u2014and this\nisn\u2019t regarded as punishment of the third party or anyone\nelse\u2014in virtue of which the guilty party\u2019s debt of\npunishment is canceled (Quinn 1994: 298). We can call this the\n\u201cpenal cancellation\u201d view.\n\nAdvocates of penal substitution tend to defend it on three grounds.\nFirst, they argue that a proper interpretation of scripture demands a\npenal substitutionary view (see, e.g., Craig 2020; S. Jeffrey et al.\n(2007); Schreiner 2006a; Stott 1986). This claim has been widely\ncontested (see, e.g., Belousek-Snyder 2011; Eberhart 2011). Second,\nthey accept something like what Purtill (1990) calls \u201cstrict\nretributionism\u201d\u2014the demands of justice require that proper\npunishment be delivered\u2014alongside the idea that if mere humans\nreceived this justice they would be separated from God forever in\neternal damnation. Strict retributionism has also been widely\ncontested (see, e.g., Purtill 1990). Third, some (Porter 2002; 2004)\nreject strict retributionism in favor of what we might call\n\u201cpenal goodness\u201d\u2014it is good for sinners to be\npunished, even if they have repented, apologized, and made reparation,\nas it sends a message about the seriousness of sin. Although\nGod\u2019s justice does not require that he punish sinners, because\nof this good aspect of punishment, he does\n punish.[41]\n\nPenal substitution faces a host of objections. Some of the objections\nto satisfaction theory also target penal\n substitution.[42]\n Others specifically target penal substitution; three have been\nparticularly influential.\n\nOne objection is that penal substitution is incoherent because\npunishment necessarily expresses condemnation of the person punished,\nbut Christ surely is not condemned when he suffers and dies on the\ncross.\n Section 2.8\n above discusses this objection and some replies. Here one further\nreply should be mentioned. Some defenders of penal substitution, such\nas the Reformed theologian Turretin, believe that human sins are\nimputed to Christ\u2014that is, Christ is treated legally as if he\nhad sinned, or human guilt for sin is transferred or replicated in\nChrist. If sins are imputed to Christ, then Christ may well be\ncondemned for sin since he then would at least bear guilt for human\nsin (Craig 2020: 161). Imputation has been objected to on the grounds\nthat there is no area of morality where imputation seems possible (M.\nMurphy 2009; Crisp 2020a. Craig replies that God, as the ultimate\nlawgiver, has sole authority to impute sins and so it isn\u2019t\nsurprising we don\u2019t accept it in other areas of morality or law.\nHe also finds analogies to imputation in our law from legal fictions\n(e.g., treating a ship as a person) and vicarious liability (e.g.,\nholding employers liable for acts done by employees in their role as\nemployees).\n\nA second objection is that, on the penal substitution view, justice\nisn\u2019t done because the full punishment isn\u2019t paid by the\nsubstitute. The full punishment due for sin, according to penal\nsubstitution, is eternal separation from God. However, Christ plainly\ndoes not suffer eternal separation from God.\n\nOne reply is that during and while dead, Christ endures enough\nsuffering to match the suffering of those eternally separated from God\n(Craig 2020: 209). However, the punishment for sin isn\u2019t just\nthe suffering\u2014it\u2019s the eternal separation. No amount of\nsuffering matches eternal separation (Stump 2018: 78). A second reply\nis that God, in his divine authority, may accept a lesser punishment\nin place of full punishment (Turretin\n 1978).[43]\n\nThe third objection is perhaps the most influential: penal\nsubstitution of the sort supposedly involved in the atonement is\nimmoral. Perhaps an innocent person paying a guilty person\u2019s\npenal fine is morally acceptable, but punishment that involves hard\ntreatment such as the death penalty, imprisonment, and lashings cannot\nbe justly leveled upon an innocent, even willing, third party. We do\nnot have the hint of an intuition that it would be just, say, for an\ninnocent mother to willingly take on the death penalty due her son for\nmurder.\n\nOne reply is that God in his authority\u2014in virtue of divine\ncommand theory\u2014can accept what he will to fulfill justice. If he\nchooses to accept a substitute, then that is just (Craig 2020:\n 177).[44]\n The second reply is that, although penal substitution is rarely\njustified, there are plausible conditions in which it would be\njustified and in the case of human sin and Christ being God incarnate,\nthose conditions are met (Strabbing 2016).\n4.5 Moral Influence\n\nMoral influence views say that Christ atones for human sin by\ninfluencing humans to live a morally good life. In effect, these views\nemphasize the moral transformation aspect of atonement. This view is\noften attributed to the twelfth century theologian\n Abelard.[45]\n Contemporary scholarship has tended to see Abelard\u2019s view as\nmore sophisticated (Quinn 1993; Weingart 1970), although some still\nargue that Abelard is best understood as embracing a moral influence\ntheory (Pugh 2014). Many theologians of the German\nAufkl\u00e4rung endorsed moral influence views (McGrath\n1985), as did Socinus (1668), Kant (1793 [1998]), Rashdall (1920) and,\nmore recently, Hick (1993 [2005]).\n\nMoral influence views differ regarding the mechanism by which humans\nare influenced to live morally. The moral exemplar view says that\nChrist is an example of a morally excellent life. The mechanism of\ninfluence is inspiration\u2014Christ\u2019s example inspires us to\ngreater moral heights. This view has been repeatedly criticized for\n(i) downplaying the fact that humans have sinned and thus need to be\nreconciled to God, not just inspired to live better (McGrath 1985),\nand (ii) offering too thin a mechanism (Crisp 2020b). To be a model\nfor inspiration does not make us righteous and does not overcome the\nforces preventing us from being righteous. To put it another way, on\nthe moral exemplar view Christ does not atone for humans, but at most\nhe motivates humans to atone.\n\nMore sophisticated moral influence views work around the above\nobjections. They can say that Christ\u2019s death shows the depth of\nhuman depravity, inspiring humans not just to want to be better\npeople, but also to see more clearly their own sins and to repent for\nthose sins. Furthermore, the Holy Spirit\u2014the third person of the\nTrinity\u2014works to bring about transformation within a person who\nis open to receiving it (Moberly 1924). The Holy Spirit can transform\npeople and undo obstacles to transformation that would be difficult or\nimpossible to manage without God\u2019s help.\n\nHowever, even these more sophisticated views face a host of\nobjections:\n\nthey do not adequately account for the Biblical ideas that\nChrist\u2019s atoning work is substitutionary, representative, and\nexpiatory (Crisp 2020b),\nthey cannot explain why Christ\u2019s death is crucial for\natonement (Pugh 2014: 132), and\nthey cannot account for the Biblical language of sacrifice.\n\n5. Recent Theories\n5.1 Christus Victor Theories\n\nAul\u00e9n\u2019s (1930 [1931]) study of patristic views of\natonement led to a flourishing of that approach in theological\nliterature into the twenty-first century. Christus Victor views\nhighlight the ransom motif from scripture: humans are in some way\nenslaved to the power of sin and their only escape from its power can\ncome from a rescuer, Jesus Christ, who will free humans from its\npower. However, contemporary views rarely espouse the ransom theory\ndescribed above.\n\nSome, such as Gregory Boyd (2006), take seriously Satan\u2019s\nexistence and the reality of demonic activity, and argue that\nChrist\u2019s atoning work is aimed at undermining their influence\nover humans. Christ does this through his teaching, healing, and\nexorcism ministry. But his death and resurrection constitute his\nultimate defeat of Satan, as he allows Satan to influence humans to\nkill him, only to show that Satan cannot win. Christ\u2019s\nresurrection is central to atonement, on this view, as it is a\ndemonstration of defeat over Satan\u2019s worst.\n\nOthers, such as Darby Kathleen Ray (1998), J. Denny Weaver (2001), and\nWalter Wink (1992), demythologize the Christus Victor view. What\nhumans need to be freed from is not literal demons, but a sort of\ndepersonalized power of evil that humans have allowed to infect their\ninstitutions, organizations, and cultures. Christ combats the power of\nevil nonviolently. In doing so, particularly through his death, he\nunmasks evil by showing it at its worst. When humans see evil\nunmasked, and then see that Christ defeats its worst by being\nresurrected, humans are drawn instead to God\u2019s way of life and\nhis response to evil.\n\nChristus Victor theories have been criticized on various grounds (some\nare only relevant to certain specific theories). First, they do not\naccount for the importance of Christ\u2019s crucifixion for atonement\n(Thurow 2021a). The victory over the powers could have been obtained\nin so many ways (and indeed is obtained in ways other than his death)\nnot involving the death of the innocent son of God. Second, they\ndownplay individual responsibility for sin (Schreiner 2006b). This can\nmake it seem like the Christus Victor accounts don\u2019t offer a\ntheory of atonement since they do not explain how the wrong done to\nGod by human sin is resolved (Crisp 2020a: 55). Lastly, if the primary\nmechanism of atonement is to free humans from the power of sin,\nempirical evidence indicates that this hasn\u2019t been achieved\n(Reichenbach 2006). And yet, Christ is said to have already atoned for\nhuman sin.\n5.2 Another Satisfaction Theory\n\nSwinburne\u2019s theory of atonement is Anselmian, although it\ndispenses with Anselm\u2019s calculus about how valuable the\nsatisfaction must be in order to atone. According to Swinburne (1989),\natonement has four components: repentance, apology, reparation, and\npenance (see\n section 2.6\n for a description of Swinburne\u2019s notion of penance). For less\nsevere wrongs, repentance and apology may suffice to atone, but for\nmore serious wrongs\u2014especially those that cause harm aside from\nthe offense itself\u2014reparation and penance are required. Since\nhuman sin is immense and immensely harmful, humans must make\nreparation and penance for sin\u2014and not only for their own\npersonal sin, but also for the sins of their forebears, to whom they\nowe a debt of helping to repair their moral debts. However, the victim\nmay determine what counts as adequate satisfaction for wrongdoing.\nChrist\u2019s entire life lived in obedience and service to God,\nwhich caused his death at the hands of his enemies, was offered by\nChrist as a reparation and penance for human sin. Humans can adopt it\nas their own reparation and penance by adding to it their personal\nrepentance and apology.\n\nSwinburne\u2019s theory evades many of the objections to\nAnselm\u2019s satisfaction theory presented in\n section 4.3\n (although Hick 1994 argues that some of the classic objections\napply). He has responded to Stump\u2019s objection that his view\nmakes forgiveness contingent by arguing that Stump\u2019s view of\nforgiveness is not well reflected in Christ\u2019s view of\nforgiveness, whereas his is (Swinburne 2019). Cross\u2019s and\nLombardo\u2019s objections have yet to be rebutted.\n\nPorter (2004), among others (Quinn 1994; Stump 2018; Thurow 2021a),\nobjects that Swinburne\u2019s theory does not explain why\nChrist\u2019s death is distinctly important for atonement. His\nperfect life is what appears to do the reparative work; his death\nappears to be simply a causal consequence of that work, but not\nsomething in virtue of which reparation is made. Hick (1994) adds that\nsince Swinburne thinks God could have accepted a supererogatory act\nfrom a mere human or angel as satisfaction, it is hard to see why God\nwould instead use the horrific death of the Son of God as\nsatisfaction. McNaughton (1992) and Aspenson (1996) present other\ncritiques.\n5.3 Marian/Thomistic Theory\n\nBuilding upon her earlier interpretations and developments of\nAquinas\u2019s views on atonement (Stump 1988; 2003), Eleonore Stump\n(2018) defends what she calls a Marian theory of atonement (named\nafter the many Marys in the New Testament). According to this theory,\nChrist\u2019s atonement is aimed at bringing humans into union with\nGod in love. To be united in love, both parties must share attention\nwith each other and desire the other wholeheartedly. Guilt and shame\ndue to human sin, and its resultant stain on the soul, prevent humans\nfrom embracing union with God. God is fully ready to reconcile; the\nonly thing preventing reconciliation is human resistance to God.\nChrist\u2019s atoning work enables, in several ways, a bond of love\nbetween humans and God. First, Christ experiences on the cross what it\nis like to commit every single human sin in history, and thus God is\nattentive in a second-person way to humans. Second, Christ\u2019s\ndeath on the cross is the best way for God to melt the hearts of\nhumans, who resist accepting God\u2019s love. Those who thus\nsurrender to God receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, which gives them\na second-person awareness of God, and gives them a desire to desire\nGod, which in time sanctifies humans to bring their first-order\ndesires in line with this second-order desire. Through this process\nall of the obstacles to reconciliation from guilt, shame, and stain on\nthe soul, are dealt with.\n\nStump justifies her view in part by repudiating Anselmian views and\ninsisting that God\u2019s forgiveness and readiness for\nreconciliation is universal and unconditional. As noted in\n section 4.3,\n several have questioned her views about love and forgiveness. Thurow\nand Strabbing (2020) argue that the core of Anselm\u2019s\nview\u2014that human sin is so bad that repentant sinners ought to\nand will want to offer satisfaction to God\u2014is plausible and can\nbe incorporated into Stump\u2019s account of atonement. They also\nquestion her account of surrendering to God. Others have questioned\nhow Stump\u2019s view would account for restoring damage to nature\nfrom human sin (Pawl 2021) and for atoning for social sin (Pogin\n2021). Dougherty (2019), A. Jeffrey (2021), and Rea (2019) critique\nother details. Stump (2019; 2021) responds to some of these\nconcerns.\n5.4 Participation Theories\n\nParticipation theories take as their starting point various statements\nof the apostle Paul:\n\n\u201cI have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but\nChrist lives in me\u201d (Galatians 2:19\u201320),\n\u201cwe were therefore buried with him through baptism into\ndeath in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through\nthe glory of the Father, we too may live a new life\u201d (Romans\n6:4),\n\u201cwe were baptized by one Spirit into one body\u201d (1Cor.\n12:13) and\nChrist is the head of the body (Colossians 1:18).\n\n\nParticipation theories take these statements to indicate that\natonement works by humans being in some way united with Christ, so\nthat what he does is done also for them, which also effects healing in\nhuman hearts and minds. These theories thus emphasize the\n divinization/healing motif,\n where this healing is brought about through participation in a union\nwith Christ.\n\nBayne and Restall (2009) argue that participation theories do a better\njob than other theories of explaining why the incarnation is important\nfor atonement, and that they rightly view sin as a pollution that\nproduces a relational problem (rather than as a deontic matter of\nfailing in a duty). Crisp (2016; 2020a) advocates for a theory that\nemploys a robust notion of union. All fallen humans are part of a\nfour-dimensional entity, fallen humanity. Christ becomes human and\ncreates a new four-dimensional entity, redeemed humanity, of those who\njoin themselves to him in faith and love. The Holy Spirit brings about\ntransformation in the merely human members of redeemed\nhumanity\u2014using Christ\u2019s atoning work to bring about\ntransformation. Gorman\u2019s (2014) new-covenant model understands\nunion to result from a covenant, and what Christ\u2019s atonement\ndoes is form a new covenant through which various benefits flow to its\nmembers.\n5.5 Mashup Theories\n\nMany people want to combine elements of different theories into one\nlarger theory. Sometimes this is done by centering one theory while\nbuilding elements of other theories around it (e.g., Packer 1974, who\ncenters penal substitution). But one could also attempt to bring\nseveral theories together without centering any one. Crisp (2020a)\ncalls these \u201cmashup theories\u201d. Examples include Boersma\n(2004; 2006), who uses Irenaeus\u2019s notion of recapitulation to\ntie together Christus Victor, penal substitution, and moral influence,\nand McNall (2019), who tries to integrate the same theories together\nusing the metaphor of a mosaic in which each theory depicts part of a\nmosaic of Christ. Some have objected to mashup theories on the grounds\nthat each theory has a different internal logic\u2014a different\n\u201ctarget\u201d of atonement\u2014and purports to present a\ncentral mechanism for how Christ atones (Weaver 2006). Baker and Green\nendorse a kaleidoscope approach to theories of atonement which,\nalthough superficially similar to mashup theories, regards all\ntheories as culturally conditioned and limited, although valuable,\nways to understand Christ\u2019s atonement (Baker & Green 2011;\nGreen 2006). Others have defended the mashup approach. Gunton (1989)\nconstrues the classic atonement theories as built around different\nguiding metaphors that can and should be combined to provide a fuller\nunderstanding of Christ\u2019s atonement. Thurow (2021b) argues that\nsince atonement aims at reconciliation, and there are various\ndimensions to reconciling, a theory of atonement could view different\nclassic theories as articulating different dimensions of atonement\ncorresponding to unique dimensions of reconciliation.\n6. Collective Atonement\n\nIn everyday speech we sometimes talk of collectives (or groups)\noffering atonement or being the recipients of atonement. For example,\npeople discuss whether Germany has sufficiently atoned for its Nazi\npast (M. Smith 2019\n [Other Internet Resources])\n and how the Canadian government has atoned for its mistreatment of\nindigenous populations (Skylstad 2021\n [Other Internet Resources]),\n and Roman Catholic popes have apologized for the role of the Church\nin the sexual abuse scandal and in harm to native people during the\nconquest of the Americas (Cunningham\n 2022).[46]\n There is considerable dispute about how to understand these\nattributions of responsibility to collectives and the moral action of\nthe collectives (see the entry on\n collective responsibility\n for details). Some take them at face value and accept a realm of\ncollective responsibility that is distinct from the individual\nresponsibility born by members of the collective (e.g., Isaacs 2011).\nOthers object that only individuals can be responsible for actions and\nthat groups can be regarded as responsible in only a metaphorical\nsense (e.g., H. D. Lewis 1948; Narveson 2002).\n\nBoth approaches have a range of important moral phenomena to explain.\nThese include: apology for a collective and how in some cases victims\nfeel that an apology from a group is more needed than an apology from\nindividual members of the group; collective responsibility for\nhistorical injustices when no currently existing member of the group\ncommitted or aided anyone in committing any of the injustices; the\nsense of guilt or shame at being a member of a collective that has\nwronged people; morally acceptable collective punishment; that\nindividuals in a guilty group can have varying degrees of\nresponsibility connected to the action for which the group is guilty.\n(See French & Wettstein 2006, 2014; Isaacs & Vernon 2011; and\nMay & Hoffman 1991 for important collections of essays on these\nand other related issues.)\n\nCollective atonement is one of these phenomena. Insofar as groups can\nbe responsible for actions or states of affairs in the world, they can\nalso be responsible for atoning for the same. Since atonement aims at\nreconciliation, collective atonement would aim at reconciling one\ngroup with another individual or group. Roy Brooks, for example,\nargues that \u201cracial reconciliation should be the primary purpose\nof racial redress\u201d (2004: 141). He thus presents what he calls\nan atonement model for black reparations, according to which\nreconciliation is the goal, which is to be achieved through government\napology and reparation. Reparations are needed not only because of the\nextent of the harm done but because they are \u201cessential to\natonement\u201d, as they \u201cmake apologies believable\u201d\n(2004: 142). Even if there are no agents literally collectively\nresponsible for anything, there are bad social facts and relations\nthat can cause and result from wrongdoing\u2014these are sometimes\ncalled social evils or social sins (John Paul II 1984). Sometimes\nadequate atonement will require making reparations for social\nevils.\n\nSome reflections on the Christian doctrine of atonement make use of\nnotions of collectivity. The version of the\n divinization/healing motif\n that highlights Christ\u2019s role as a second Adam and as the Head\nof humanity (or the Church) posits that Christ\u2019s acting as a\nrepresentative for a collective entity is part of how he atones for\nhuman sin. The Hebrew scriptures contain a clear notion of collective\nresponsibility, illustrated most clearly in the Day of Atonement\nrituals (Milgrom 1991) and this notion may influence the New Testament\nconception of Christ as a priest offering the sacrifice of himself.\nSome argue that Anselm regards, or is committed to regarding, Christ\nas atoning for collective sin (D. Brown 2004; Thurow 2017b; for a\ndifferent reading see Rogers 2012). Drawing on these sources, Thurow\n2015 develops a theory of atonement on which Christ atones primarily\nfor the collective sins of humanity and secondarily for the sins of\nindividual humans who join themselves to Christ in faith and\nrepentance.\n7. Feminist and Womanist Approaches to Atonement\n\nFeminist and womanist scholars have argued that our understanding of\natonement needs to be transformed by an awareness that (i) women\nthroughout history in many cultures have suffered many wrongs while\ntheir culture ignored or belittled their need for atonement/amends,\nwhile at the same time (ii) in many cultures women have born the\nburden of repairing moral fragmentation that happens in households\n(Spelman 2002: 26ff). As a result, women have faced a sort of\noppression in relation to atonement: they are held responsible for\nhelping make amends for other peoples\u2019 (often men\u2019s)\nwrongs, while their own need for atonement is sidelined. Many feminist\nand womanist theologians and philosophers have argued that these\nfacts, and others grounded in women\u2019s experiences, are grounds\nfor critique of traditional theories of the Christian doctrine of\natonement.\n\nTanner (2010: 249f) observes that several feminist criticisms are in\nline with other standard criticisms in the history of theological\nargument. Some question the character of God as depicted in the\nclassic atonement theories. J. Brown and Parker (1989) argue the\nclassic theories endorse divine child abuse, as Christ, the son of\nGod, suffers terribly at the Father\u2019s will for the sake of\nothers and their actions. Others question the mechanism of\natonement\u2014for instance, D. Williams (1991) argues that black\nwomen in America have historically had terrible experiences of coerced\nand voluntary surrogacy, acting as surrogate parents and household\nmanagers for white folks, performing field work, and providing sexual\npleasure to male slaveholders. Many traditional theories treat Christ\nas a substitute, or surrogate, who atones for human sin. The\nexperience of black women shows that even voluntary surrogacy is not\nnecessarily a great good.\n\nHowever, feminist and womanist critiques extend beyond the classic\ncritiques. One of their core claims is that\n\n\ntheologies of the cross are seen to be complicit in the oppression,\nvictimization and disempowerment of women. (Keshgegian 2000: 476; see\nalso Buck 2020)\n\n\nD. Williams suggests that\n\n\nthe image of the surrogate-God\u2026supports and reinforces the\nexploitation that has accompanied [black women\u2019s] experience\nwith surrogacy. (1991: 9)\n\n\nBrock and Parker (2001) present many stories of women who have\nsuffered from abuse and neglect at the hands of a partner and were\ntold by church members to endure the suffering\u2014even rejoice in\nit\u2014as it brings them closer to Christ who suffered on the\ncross.\n\n\nIf one extols the silent and freely-chosen suffering of Christ, who\nwas \u201cobedient unto death\u201d (Philippians 2:8), as an example\nto be imitated by all those victimized by patriarchal\noppression\u2026one not only legitimates but also enables acts of\nviolence against women and children. (Fiorenza 1994: 106)\n\n\nThis can in turn lead to a sort of hermeneutical injustice wherein\nwomen and other oppressed people are hindered from seeing that\nresisting injustice and standing up for one\u2019s own well-being are\npermissible and noble (Pogin 2020).\n\nIn response to these critiques, some endorse forms of the Christus\nVictor theory that treat Christ\u2019s death as a tragedy, not as an\nintrinsically redemptive act (Ray 1998; Weaver 2001), while others\nendorse a version of participation theory (Tanner 2010) on which\nChrist\u2019s divine life-giving power deeply manifest on the cross\nand humans can receive a share of that power through union with\nChrist. Some have defended Anselm\u2019s theory against the critiques\n(Keshgegian 2000). Some argue that a full appreciation of the doctrine\nof the Trinity can help evade some of the critiques (Crisp 2020).\n\nGu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir (2010; 2017) argues that some of the\ncritiques do not adequately distinguish between theology being abused\nand theology being essentially abusive. She thinks when a theology of\nthe cross glorifies suffering per se, theology is being abused.\nHowever, a theology of the cross\u2014and an account of\natonement\u2014need not be essentially abusive if it embraces the\nidea that suffering and death can be transformed into joy and life and\noffers hope of a better life to those who suffer unjustly.\n\nOne thing the feminist and womanist critiques show is that there is\nneed for further reflection on how the Christian doctrine of the\natonement ought to integrate with and impact human practices of\natonement.
