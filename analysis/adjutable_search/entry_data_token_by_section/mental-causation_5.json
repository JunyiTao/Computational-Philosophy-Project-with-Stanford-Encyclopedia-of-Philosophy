    "main_text": "The Problem of Interaction || Conservation Laws\n2.3 Conservation Laws\n\nA third version of the Problem of Interaction appeals to conservation\nlaws. The leading idea is simple: Soul\u2013body interaction would\nhave to change the amount of energy in the physical universe. When\nsouls act, new energy would appear in, say, the brain. When souls are\nacted upon, some quantity of energy in the brain would vanish. But\neither scenario would contravene established conservation laws, which\npermit only the conversion and redistribution of energy (or\nmass\u2013energy) within the physical universe, not its addition or\nsubtraction.\n\nThis version of the problem has dogged dualism since the scientific\nrevolution (Lowe 1992; Papineau 2000), and a number of contemporary\nphilosophers present conservation as a major obstacle for dualists\n(Fodor 1981; Dennett 1991, p. 35; Heil 2012, p. 26; Papineau 2000).\nThat said, turning the leading idea into a compelling argument has\nproven difficult. First, the conservation laws do not dictate what\nkinds of energy exist, only that they must operate conservatively.\nHence, if sui generis mental energy existed, as long as it\noperated conservatively, this would be consistent with the\nconservation laws. Appealing to this fact, Hart (1988) advances a\nsubstance dualism and, combining it with a transference theory of\ncausation (\u00a72.1), argues that psychophysical causation consists\nin the transfer of such psychic energy. (For arguments against the\nexistence of sui generis mental energy, see Papineau 2000).\nSecondly, what is needed is a conservation law weak enough to have\nbeen confirmed by physical science, but strong enough to preclude\nsoul\u2013body interaction. Averill and Keating (1981) consider a\nnumber of candidate \u201claws\u201d and argue that none meets both\ncriteria. Thirdly, it\u2019s not clear in any case that a soul would\nhave to add energy to (or receive it from) the brain in order to\ninteract with it. Broad (1925, pp. 103\u20139) suggests a soul could\nact merely by redistributing the brain\u2019s energy without changing\nits quantity. Furthermore, Lowe (2000) and Gibb (2013) both advance\ndualist models of psychophysical causation according to which the\nmental does not affect the brain either by affecting the amount of\nenergy in it or by redistributing it. (For more recent discussion of\nthese and other complexities, see Montero 2006; Koksvik 2007; Gibb\n2010.)\n",
