    "preamble": "\n\nWe are often told that the moral theories defended by modern\nphilosophers fall into two types. On the one hand are rationalist\npositions developed by thinkers such as Samuel Clarke, William\nWollaston, and Richard Price. The rationalists, it is said, believe\nthat reason is the basis of morality, as morality is (in some sense)\nboth grounded in and grasped by reason. On the other hand are\nsentimentalist positions championed by philosophers such as the Third\nEarl of Shaftesbury, Francis Hutcheson, and David Hume. The\nsentimentalists, it is claimed, hold that affect is the basis of\nmorality. According to the standard classification, the\nsentimentalists believe that morality has relatively little to do with\nreason, as it is (in some sense) both grounded in and discerned by\nsentiment.\n\nThomas Reid\u2019s (1710\u20131796) moral philosophy does not neatly\nfit into this scheme of classification. To be sure, some characterize\nReid as a rationalist working within the tradition of Clarke and Price\n(see MacIntyre 1966 and Rawls 2000, Introduction). One can see why.\nReid, after all, affirms core rationalist claims, such as that there\nis a body of necessary moral principles that are self-evident to the\nordinary person. But there are important elements of Reid\u2019s\nthought that do not fit the rationalist paradigm. For example, Reid\ndefends the view that all normal, mature human beings are endowed with\na moral sense. Like philosophers such as Hutcheson and Hume, Reid\nclaims that the moral sense yields sentiments of various sorts that\nthemselves occasion \u201cour first moral conceptions,\u201d such as\nthe apprehension that an act is approbation-worthy (EAP V.ii: 279).\nThis account of concept formation, according to some philosophers,\nwould make Reid\u2019s position a version of sentimentalism (see\nD\u2019Arms 2005). In this respect, Reid\u2019s position resembles\nnot Clarke\u2019s and Price\u2019s but Hutcheson\u2019s and\nHume\u2019s.\n\nThere is, then, a sense in which Reid\u2019s moral philosophy resists\nready categorization. It is neither a version of rationalism nor\nsentimentalism, but an attempt to blend those features from both these\ntraditions that Reid found most attractive. This presents a challenge\nto the contemporary interpreter of Reid\u2019s moral philosophy. One\nwonders: Is Reid\u2019s theory of morals an exotic hybrid, one which\neludes the categories used by contemporary philosophers to describe\nethical theories?\n\nNot exactly. Anyone familiar with contemporary moral philosophy could\nnot fail to miss the resemblance that Reid\u2019s position bears to\nthe view defended some one hundred and fifty years later by W. D. Ross\n(see Ross 2002). Although Ross never mentions Reid as an influence,\nboth thinkers operate within a broadly non-naturalist framework\naccording to which the sciences offer us limited insight into the\nnature of moral reality. In so doing, they both stood against powerful\ntrends in their day to \u201cnaturalize\u201d ethics. Moreover, both\nreject monistic accounts of the moral domain, such as those defended\nby Kantians and consequentialists, according to which there is one\nmaster ethical principle from which all others are derived. According\nto both Reid and Ross, there is instead a plurality of self-evident\nmoral first principles, none of which is reducible to another.\n\nIn light of this, we might describe Reid\u2019s position as a\nproto-Rossian version of ethical intuitionism. While such a\ndescription is tempting, it would probably be misleading. For the\nparallels between Reid and Ross extend only so far. The most important\ndifference between the two thinkers is this: Ross frames his project\nin the light of G. E. Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument and\nMill\u2019s utilitarianism\u2014two philosophical topics about which\nReid knew nothing. Reid, by contrast, developed his version of ethical\nintuitionism within the context of a defense of a certain account of\nhuman agency, according to which each of us is endowed with\n\u201cactive power\u201d which we can freely exercise. Reid believed\nthat this account of human agency, when coupled with our best\nscientific knowledge, yields a form of non-naturalist ethical\nintuitionism. Call a position that grounds many of its core\nmetaethical claims about the nature of moral reality in a particular\nview of human agency an agency-centered account.\nAgency-centered views tell us that in order to understand the nature\nof moral reality we must first examine the nature of agency.\nReid\u2019s is an agency-centered version of ethical intuitionism.\nRoss\u2019s, by contrast, is not.\n\nThe project of this essay is to present both the motivations for and\nfundamental contours of Reid\u2019s agency-centered intuitionist\nview. Before diving into the details of Reid\u2019s position,\nhowever, it may be worth saying a word about the influence of\nReid\u2019s views in contemporary ethics. If one were to gauge this\ninfluence by the number of books or articles written in the last one\nhundred years about Reid\u2019s ethics, one would have to conclude\nthat his influence is negligible. Very little has been written about\nReid\u2019s moral philosophy. Indeed, Reid is not even included in\nwhat is perhaps the standard anthology on the British Moralists, the\ntwo-volume work edited by Selby-Bigge of the same title (Selby-Bigge\n1965). Moreover, one would also have to conclude that Reid\u2019s\ninfluence on moral philosophers who receive a great deal of attention,\nsuch as Moore, is marginal. For example, in the flurry of work\nproduced in 2003 on the centenary of the publication of Moore\u2019s\nPrincipia Ethica, no one mentions Reid as an influence on\nMoore\u2019s ethical views.\n\nThe reality of the matter, however, is that Reid has indeed exercised\nconsiderable influence on contemporary moral philosophy, albeit\nindirectly. This influence runs primarily through Henry Sidgwick, who\nknew Reid\u2019s work well (see Sidgwick 2000, Ch. 16). Sidgwick, it\nseems, exposed his student, G. E. Moore, to Reid\u2019s views (see\nBeanblossom 1983). Reid\u2019s broadly common sense methodology and\nhis positive views were subsequently taken up by Moore. Among the more\nsalient similarities one finds in their ethical views is that both\nthinkers are interested in whether the fundamental moral properties\nare definable. Reid claims they are not; fundamental moral properties\nare, in Reid\u2019s estimation, simple, indefinable, and sui generis\n(EAP III.iii.v). Famously, Moore said the same, although for somewhat\ndifferent reasons. And the rest, as they say, is history. Depending on\none\u2019s views, one might view this history as one in which Moore\nfinally put ethical theory on the right track or, alternatively,\npushed it off the rails. Whatever one\u2019s opinion on this issue,\nReid seems to have had a role in its direction.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The System of Necessity\n\nReid\u2019s moral philosophy, according to the gloss offered thus\nfar, is an agency-centered intuitionist position, which also blends\ntogether both rationalist and sentimentalist influences. Given its\nsynthetic character, it is natural to ask how best to enter into\nReid\u2019s thought. A promising avenue is to note a pattern of\nthought present in Reid\u2019s work. In his work in epistemology and\nphilosophy of mind, which is found primarily in An Inquiry into\nthe Human Mind (IHM) and Essays on the Intellectual Powers of\nMan (EIP), Reid frames his project as a response to a general\nposition that he calls the Way of Ideas. This position, which Reid\nsays unites philosophers as diverse as Aristotle, Locke, Berkeley, and\nHume, holds that we are never acquainted with the external world but\nonly with \u201cimages\u201d or sense data in the mind. What Reid\nsays positively about our perception of the external world is couched\nas a response to this view. Although it is rarely noted, Reid\u2019s\nwork in ethics in Essays on the Active Powers of Man (EAP) is\nalso framed as a response to a general position, which he claims is\nadopted by philosophers as diverse as Spinoza, Leibniz, and Hume. This\nposition Reid ordinarily calls the System of Necessity. Reid\u2019s\nown positive views about the nature of agency and the moral domain are\nbest viewed as a response to the System of Necessity. Let us, then,\nenter Reid\u2019s moral philosophy by having before us the rudiments\nof the System of Necessity.\n\nSuppose you have fallen asleep in your bed after a long day of work.\nYou briefly wake during the night, noting that someone has left a\nkitchen light on. You do not want, however, to get out of bed at this\nhour. Still, after pondering the issue for a moment, you know that you\nshould do so. So, you drag yourself out of bed and turn the light off.\nHow should we describe your behavior?\n\nAccording to advocates of the System of Necessity, there is a sense in\nwhich the performance of this action is up to you. No one forced you\nto get up out of bed. There is also a sense in which you did it\nbecause you believed you should. It is this belief, coupled with a\ndesire\u2014perhaps to do what is right\u2014that moved you to get\nout of bed. Finally, there is a sense in which there is an explanation\nof your action that is perfectly law-like. Because your desire (let us\nsuppose) to do what is right was stronger than your desire to stay in\nbed, it won out. Under the supposition that stronger motivations win,\nwe have a perfectly general, law-like explanation of why you acted as\nyou did.\n\nIn Reid\u2019s view, then, proponents of the System of Necessity\naffirm these three claims:\n\nEvery human action has a sufficient cause.\nProvided normal background conditions obtain, the sufficient cause\nof a human action is its motive, which is a mental state of an\nagent.\nEvery human action is subsumable under a law, which specifies that\nfor any agent S, set of motives M, and action\nA at t, necessarily, if S performs\nA, then there is some member of M that is\nS\u2019s strongest motive, which causes S to\nperform A at t.\n\n\nViewed from on angle, these claims appear not to fit tightly together.\nOne could accept any one and reject the others. Viewed from another\nangle, however, they express a unified picture of human action, one\naccording to which human action is a natural phenomenon that is\nsubsumable under laws in much the same way that other ordinary natural\nevents are. If one is attracted to this broadly naturalistic position,\nas Reid claims that figures such as Spinoza, Hume, Priestley, and\nKames were, then these claims form a natural package (see Cuneo\n2011a).\n\nReid, however, believed that this package of claims provides a deeply\ndistorted picture of human action. Why did he believe this? In large\npart because he could not see how it could account for genuinely\nautonomous human agency in at least two senses of this multivalent\nterm. In the first place, autonomous actions are ones that can be\nproperly ascribed to an agent. But if the System of Necessity were\ntrue, Reid claimed, there is no proper sense in which actions that\nappear to be performed by an agent could justly be attributed to that\nagent\u2014the human agent being simply a theater in which various\ndrives and impulses vie for dominance. One could, if the System of\nNecessity were right, attribute actions to mental states such as\ndesires. And this might be adequate to describe the behavior of\nanimals and addicts. But, Reid claims, it is not adequate to describe\npurposeful human action. For human action, in Reid\u2019s view, must\nbe attributable to the person as a whole, not some force working in or\non her (see Korsgaard 2009, xii).\n\nSecondly, autonomous agency is such that an agent can exercise a\ncertain type of control over the various impulses that present\nthemselves when deliberating. Suppose, to return to our earlier case,\nthat you briefly wake during the night, noting that someone has left a\nkitchen light on. You want not to get out of bed at this hour. Must\nyou capitulate to your strongest desire? Not if you are autonomous.\nFor genuinely autonomous agents, according to Reid, are reflective.\nAny desire is such that an autonomous agent can direct his attention\nnot only to its object, but also to the desire itself, asking: Should\nI act on it? That is, any such agent can ask these two questions:\nFirst, would acting on this desire contribute to my genuine\nwell-being? And, second, is there a sufficient moral reason or\nobligation for acting on or ignoring it? These two questions advert to\nwhat Reid calls the rational principles of action (see EAP,\nIII.iii.i). The first principle Reid calls the principle with\n\u201cregard to our good on the whole,\u201d the second the\n\u201cprinciple of duty.\u201d The fact that you needn\u2019t\ncapitulate to your desire to stay in bed but can step back and\ncritically assess it with reference to these two rational principles\nof action, in Reid\u2019s estimation, is what separates normal,\nmature human beings from the rest of the natural order.\n\nThis point was important enough to Reid that he highlights it in the\nIntroduction to Essays on the Active Powers and\nelsewhere:\n\n\nThe brutes are stimulated to various actions by their instincts, by\ntheir appetites, by their passions: but they seem to be necessarily\ndetermined by the strongest impulse, without any capacity of\nself-government\u2026. They may be trained up by discipline, but\ncannot be governed by law. There is no evidence that they have the\nconception of a law, or of its obligation.\n\nMan is capable of acting from motives of a higher nature. He perceives\na dignity and worth in one course of conduct, a demerit and turpitude\nin another, which brutes have not the capacity to discern\u2026.\n\n[Men] judge what ends are most worthy to be pursued, how far every\nappetite and passion may be indulged, and when it ought to be\nresisted\u2026. In them [the brutes] we may observe one passion\ncombating another, and the strongest prevailing; but we perceive no\ncalm principle in their constitution that is superior to every\npassion, and able to give law to it. (EAP, 5 and II.ii: 57)\n\n\nWhen Reid talks about our capacity to be governed by law he has in\nmind our capacity to regulate our behavior by assessing it in terms of\nthe two rational principles of action. Reid, then, champions what we\nmight call a regulation account of autonomy. We are\nautonomous, rational agents, in Reid\u2019s estimation, in virtue of\nthe fact that we can regulate or govern our behavior by stepping back\nfrom our various impulses, desires, instincts, and assess prospective\nactions in light of the two rational principles of action. It is this\ndimension of human action, according to Reid, that is missing\naltogether from the description of agency offered by advocates of the\nSystem of Necessity.\n1.1 Reid\u2019s alternative\n\nIn Reid\u2019s view, then, the System of Necessity fails to offer an\naccurate account of human agency. What alternative account of agency\ndid Reid propose? One that accepts the following three claims:\n\n\n(1\u2032) Every human action has a cause, which in the case of free\nhuman action is not itself a motive, but the agent himself.\n\n(2\u2032) Motives are not mental states but the ends for which an\nagent acts.\n\n(3\u2032) Human action is nomic only to this extent: If an agent\nfails to exercise autonomy when deliberating (and he is not in a state\nof indifference), then his strongest desire to act in a certain way\nwill prevail. If he exercises autonomy when deliberating, however,\nthen he will act on the motive that seems to him most rationally\nappropriate.\n\n\nLet us consider these three claims in turn.\n\nThe first statement, (1\u2032), expresses Reid\u2019s commitment to\nan agent causal account of human free action. Reid presents various\narguments for this view in Essays on the Active Powers of\nMan, but it is worth emphasizing that a central consideration\nthat Reid furnishes in its favor appeals not to common sense but to\nwhat science appears to tell us. Reid, like most of his\ncontemporaries, was a Newtonian. In Reid\u2019s judgment, however,\nNewtonian science is committed to the claim \u201cthat matter is a\nsubstance altogether inert, and merely passive; that gravitation, and\nthe other attractive or repulsive powers \u2026 are not inherent in\nits nature, but impressed upon it by some external cause\u201d (EAP\nI.vi: 34). Matter, according to this view, does not cause anything. On\nthe assumptions that there is genuine causality in the world and that\nagents are causes, it follows that agents, who are not material\nthings, in Reid\u2019s view, are the only causes. Reid takes\nNewtonian science to imply a mitigated version of occasionalism\naccording to which the only genuine causation in the world is agent\ncausation.\n\nThe second statement above, (2\u2032), expresses Reid\u2019s\ncommitment to a broadly teleological account of human agency,\naccording to which autonomous human action is explained not by the\nimpulses that present themselves to an agent when deliberating but by\nthe ends for which she acts. In his defense of this view, Reid argues\nthat, contrary to the adherents of the System of Necessity, motives\nare not mental states that cause us to act, for motives are not the\nright sort of thing to be causes: They are not agents. In some places,\nin fact, Reid says that motives (as he thinks of them) have no\n\u201creal existence,\u201d by which he seems to mean (at least)\nthat they are not part of the spatio-temporal manifold but are\nabstracta (see EAP IV.iv: 214).\n\nThese claims might take us aback: Motives are not causes and have no\nreal existence? How could that be? When evaluating these claims, two\nthings should be noted. First, Reid is working with a rather narrow\nunderstanding of what it is for something to be a cause (and to\nexist)\u2014an understanding, we\u2019ve seen, he thinks fits best\nwith a Newtonian understanding of the world. Second, Reid\u2019s\nconsidered view about the role of motives is actually more complicated\nthan (2\u2032) would have us believe. (2\u2032) expresses the view\nthat Reid defends in Essay IV of Essays on the Active Powers,\n\u201cOf the Liberty of Moral Agents.\u201d But anyone who has read\nEssay III, \u201cOf the Principles of Action,\u201d knows that Reid\nclaims that motives or \u201cprinciples of action\u201d divide into\nthree kinds: mechanical, animal, and rational. Mechanical principles\nof action are what we would call instincts, such as the unreflective\nimpulse to protect oneself from perceived harm. Animal principles of\naction are a more varied lot. Under this category, Reid places the\nso-called benevolent affections, such as the affection felt between\nkin, gratitude to benefactors, pity and compassion, friendship, public\nspirit, and the like (see EAP III.iii.iv). He also includes the\nso-called malevolent affections, such as resentment and the desire to\ndominate others. (In section III, we will see a reason to believe that\nsome animal principles, by Reid\u2019s own lights, are not ones that\ncould be had by the animals.)\n\nAll this complicates Reid\u2019s picture. Reid seems to want to allow\nthat motives come in two varieties. On the one hand, Reid says that\nrational motives function as \u201cadvice\u201d or\n\u201cexhortation\u201d which do not push but pull us to action. On\nthe other, he describes the mechanical and animal motives as\n\u201cimpulses,\u201d which do not pull but push us to action (EAP\nII.ii and IV.iv). How best to understand what Reid is saying? Perhaps\nthe best conclusion to draw is that Reid does not have a unified\naccount of motives. Some of the rational motives are best described as\nbeing either those ends for which we act or principles by which we\nevaluate those ends for which we act. Other motives\u2014the\nmechanical and a range of the animal ones\u2014are not; they are what\npush or impel us to action (see Cuneo and Harp 2016).\n\nAre these latter motives best described as having a causal influence\non behavior? Perhaps they are, according to a more relaxed\nunderstanding of causality than that with which Reid officially works.\nFor suppose we agree that there are processes that are instigated by\nthe exercise of active power, such as the process that is instigated\nby an agent\u2019s willing to raise her arm. In Reid\u2019s view,\nthis process includes the exercise of active power, which is the\nagent\u2019s willing to raise her arm, the activity of nerves and\nmuscles and, finally, the raising of her arm. If we allow ourselves to\ntalk of elements of this process as causes in a \u201clax and popular\nsense,\u201d then perhaps some motives, in Reid\u2019s view, could\nbe called causes. Of course Reid would have to say that in some cases\nthe motives that \u201ccause\u201d us to act are not part of a\ncausal process that we ourselves instigate. Not every desire or mental\nstate we have is the causal consequence of the exercise of our active\npower in a given way. (That I desire to eat an ice cream cone, for\nexample, appears to be a causal consequence not of the exercise of my\nactive power but of your handing me an ice cream cone.) Reid would\nhave to say, then, that those mental states and events that are not\nsimply the causal consequence of the exercise of active power are\nparts of processes instigated by some other agent cause, such as God.\nThis may seem odd. But it seems to be the broader picture within which\nReid operated. All causal processes in nature (which are not due to\nus) are instigated by the exercise of God\u2019s active power. A\ntypical case of human action involves the coincidence of the exercise\nof our active power with God\u2019s (see EAP I.vi and Cuneo\n2011a).\n\nLet us now turn to the third statement above, namely, (3\u2032). This\nclaim expresses Reid\u2019s two-fold conviction that free human\naction is (i) not in any interesting sense nomic, and (ii) that we can\nassess our motives along two dimensions. We can assess them, first,\naccording to their psychological strength and, second, according to\ntheir rational authority.\n\nThat free human action is not nomic is simply an implication of\nReid\u2019s conviction that we are endowed with libertarian free\nwill, the exercise of which does not fall under any natural law in the\nsense described by Newtonian science. That our motives can be assessed\nalong two dimensions, by contrast, is an implication of Reid\u2019s\nregulation account of autonomy.\n\nTo see how Reid is thinking about the strength of motives, consider a\ncase in which you are moved to action by some animal principle of\naction. Imagine, for example, you are incited to reprimand someone in\nyour family because you believe that he or she has acted irresponsibly\nby leaving a kitchen light on during the night. One way to assess this\naction would be to ask whether it conforms to the rational principles\nof action. Let us suppose that, in the case we are considering, by\nreprimanding you risk alienating yourself from those with whom you\nlive; the circumstances you\u2019re in call for a calm and measured\nresponse. While there may be good reasons to alienate yourself from\nothers, expressing your anger in these circumstances is not one of\nthem. This motive in these circumstances, then, has no rational\nauthority.\n\nNow consider the same motive not with respect to its rational\nauthority but with regard to its psychological strength. Is this\nmotive the strongest of your motives? Reid maintains that this is a\ndifficult question to answer. One of the complaints Reid raises about\nthe System of Necessity is that it sheds no light on the matter.\nAlthough advocates of the System of Necessity claim that human actions\ncan be subsumed under natural laws, the laws to which they appeal in\norder to assess the strength of motives are either false or trivial.\nFor recall that, according to the System of Necessity:\n\n(3) Every human action is subsumable under a law, which specifies that\nfor any agent S, set of motives M, and action\nA at t, necessarily, if S performs\nA, then there is some member of M that is\nS\u2019s strongest motive, which causes S to\nperform A at t.\n\n\nReid finds this claim totally unpersuasive. It is worth quoting at\nlength what he has to say about it:\n\nIt is a question of fact, whether the influence of motives be fixed by\nlaws of nature, so that they shall always have the same effect in the\nsame circumstance. Upon this, indeed, the question about liberty and\nnecessity hangs. But I have never seen any proof that there are such\nlaws of nature, far less any proof that the strongest motive always\nprevails. However much our late fatalists have boasted of this\nprinciple as of a law of nature, without telling us what they mean by\nthe strongest motive, I am persuaded that, whenever they shall be\npleased to give us any measure of the strength of motives distinct\nfrom their prevalence, it will appear, from experience, that the\nstrongest motive does not always prevail. If no other test or measure\nof the strength of motives can be found but their prevailing, then\nthis boasted principle will be only an identical proposition, and\nsignify only that the strongest motive is the strongest motive\n\u2026 which proves nothing. (C, 176\u201377)\n\n\nAccording to Reid, (3), then, is either false or trivial (for\ndiscussion, see Yaffe 2004, Ch. 6).\n\nWe should now have a better picture of Reid\u2019s favored account of\nhuman agency. It is one according to which agents are causes, at least\nsome motives are not causes but ends, and autonomous action is\nnon-nomic. Earlier I said that this picture of agency grounds his\nnon-naturalist account of the ethical domain. Let me now explain\nhow.\n1.2 Reid\u2019s moral non-naturalism\n\nLike most of his contemporaries, Reid\u2019s worldview was Newtonian.\nWhile he was convinced that the natural sciences should conform to\nNewtonian methods, Reid held that these methods have their\nlimitations. In a passage from an unpublished review composed toward\nthe end of his life, Reid writes:\n\nThere are many important branches of human knowledge, to which Sir\nIsaac Newton\u2019s rules of Philosophizing have no relation, and to\nwhich they can with no propriety be applied. Such are Morals,\nJurisprudence, Natural Theology, and the abstract Sciences of\nMathematicks and Metaphysicks; because in none of those Sciences do we\ninvestigate the physical laws of Nature. There is therefore no reason\nto regret that these branches of knowledge have been pursued without\nregard to them. (AC, 186)\n\n\nIn this passage, Reid tells us that Newton\u2019s rules pertain only\nto the physical laws of nature and what is subsumable under them. But\nthe rational principles of action, we have seen, are not themselves\nthe physical laws of nature. They do not concern how the universe in\nfact operates. Rather, they concern how rational agents ought to\nconduct their behavior. Nor are these principles subsumable under\nNewton\u2019s laws (EAP IV.ix: 251). They are, in Reid\u2019s view,\nnot part of the space/time manifold. It follows that Newton\u2019s\nmethods should not guide our theorizing about the rational principles\nof action. Since moral principles are among the rational principles of\naction, it follows that they are not identical with or subsumable\nunder Newton\u2019s laws. Given the additional assumption that\nnatural science must conform to Newton\u2019s rules, Reid concludes\nthat morality is not the subject matter of natural science. That this\nis so, Reid continues, is \u201cno reason to regret.\u201d It is a\nmatter of simply acknowledging the implications of Newton\u2019s\nsystem\u2014implications, Reid maintains, that philosophers such as\nHume and Priestley, who also took themselves to be followers of\nNewton, had failed to appreciate.\n\nIn sum: Suppose we understand moral naturalism to be the view that\nmoral facts are natural. And suppose we say, in a rough and ready way,\nthat a fact is natural just in case it pulls its explanatory weight in\nthe natural sciences (see Wiggins 1993). Reid maintains that Newtonian\nmethods exhaust the limits of natural science. Newtonian science,\nhowever, does not investigate the ends or rational principles for\nwhich we act. The ends for which we act neither fall under Newtonian\nlaws nor are identical with them. But moral facts, Reid says, are\namong the ends or rational principles for which we act. It follows\nthat, in Reid\u2019s view, moral facts are not the proper object of\nscientific inquiry. The moral domain is autonomous.\n2. The Rational Principles of Action\n\nPhilosophers such as Hume and Priestly were eager to apply\nNewton\u2019s methods to the moral domain. Reid, however, viewed\nattempts to use Newtonian methods to understand the moral domain as\nmistaken\u2014not, once again, because he viewed Newtonian science as\nsuspect, but because he held that Newton\u2019s methods themselves\nrequire this. That said, we have seen that there is a sense in which\nReid believes that human action is law-governed. We can regulate our\nbehavior by reference to the rational principles of action. Earlier we\nsaw that these principles are of two kinds: They concern our good on\nthe whole and duty. Reid holds that these principles stand in a\ncertain kind of relation to one another. We can better identify this\nrelation by having the notion of motivational primacy before\nus.\n\nSuppose we say that a state of affairs P has motivational\nprimacy for an (ordinary adult) agent S just in case three\nconditions are met. First, in a wide range of ordinary cases,\nP is a type of consideration in light of which S\nwould act. Accordingly, were S to deliberate about what to\ndo, P is a type of state of affairs that S would, in\na wide range of cases, not only use to \u201cframe\u201d his\npractical deliberations, but also endeavor to bring about. That my\nloved ones flourish is such a state of affairs for many of\nus.\n\nSecond, P is a sufficient reason for S to act.\nRoughly put, P is a sufficient reason for S to act\njust in case were S to deliberate about what to do, then (in\na wide range of ordinary cases) S would take P to be\na reason to act and would endeavor to bring about P even if\nhe believed (or presupposed) that his doing so would not bring about\n(or increase the likelihood of his bringing about) any further state\nof affairs that he values. Imagine, for example, S is like\nmany of us inasmuch as he takes himself to have a reason to bring\nabout the flourishing of his loved ones. This is a sufficient reason\nfor S to act since he would endeavor to bring about the\nflourishing of his loved ones even if he believed that his doing so\nwould not bring about any further state of affairs that he values,\nsuch as his gaining increased notoriety among his peers.\n\nThird, P has deliberative weight for S. For our\npurposes, we can think of this as the claim that P is a\nreason of such a type that, in a wide range of circumstances, were S\nto deliberate about what to do, then S would take P\nto trump other types of reasons, even other sufficient reasons. Many\nof us, for example, hold that there is a beautiful sunset on the\nhorizon is a sufficient reason to stop whatever we are doing and\nenjoy it. Still, for most of us, that an act would bring about or\npreserve the flourishing of our loved ones has greater deliberative\nweight than this. If a person had to choose between enjoying a\nbeautiful sunset, on the one hand, or protecting her child from\ndanger, on the other, then the latter reason trumps.\n2.1 Reid\u2019s defense of The Hierarchy Thesis\n\nHaving introduced the notion of motivational primacy, we can now\nidentify a claim that is arguably the centerpiece of Reid\u2019s\ndiscussion of rational motivation, namely:\n\nThe Hierarchy Thesis: In any case in which an agent\nmust decide what to do, considerations of what is morally required\nshould have motivational primacy. Specifically, what is morally\nrequired of an agent should have motivational primacy over what he\ntakes to be his good on the whole.\n\n\nEudaimonist positions, such as those defended in the broadly\nAristotelian tradition, reject The Hierarchy Thesis. They maintain\nthat when an agent deliberates about what to do he assumes, or ought\nto assume, that considerations concerning his own well-being or\neudaimonia have motivational primacy in a very robust sense. Every act\nthat an agent performs, say eudaimonists, either is or should be taken\nfor the sake of his own happiness. Accordingly, if eudaimonism is\ntrue, an agent operates, or ought to operate, with the following\nprinciple of action selection: Perform only those actions that, to the\nbest of one\u2019s knowledge, positively contribute to one\u2019s\nown well-being or eudaimonia. Moreover, in so doing, an agent treats,\nor ought to treat, considerations concerning his own well-being as\nbeing both a sufficient reason to act and having deliberative weight.\nWhen asked: \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d an agent\u2019s\nultimate justification will, or ought to, appeal to the way in which\nacting in that fashion contributes to her own well-being.\n\nReid rejects eudaimonism thus understood. It is safe to assume that\nReid took Butler\u2019s attack on what we might call descriptive\neudaimonism to be decisive: There is no plausibility to the idea\nthat agents necessarily will their own happiness, as they understand\nit, for they can knowingly act in self-destructive ways (cf. EAP\nIII.ii.i: 95). But Reid realized that Butler\u2019s attack left\nprescriptive eudaimonism, or the view that the\npractically rational agent takes her own well-being to have\nmotivational primacy, relatively untouched. According to this view,\nwhatever may be the case about how agents actually act, they ought to\nview their own well-being as having motivational primacy.\n\nLike Butler, Reid did not wish to recommend a picture of agency\naccording to which agents should disregard or ignore their own\nwell-being. \u201cTo serve God and be useful to mankind, without any\nconcern about one\u2019s own good and happiness,\u201d Reid writes,\nis \u201cbeyond the pitch of human nature\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv:\n166). Indeed, Reid holds that, when properly understood, a concern for\none\u2019s good on the whole naturally leads to the acquisition of\nthe moral virtues, such as justice and benevolence (EAP III.iii.iii:\n163; see also EAP V.i). Still, Reid insists that our good on the whole\nought not to be the \u201conly regulating principle of human\nconduct\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 164). Why?\n\nFor four main reasons. First, Reid claims that \u201cthe greater part\nof mankind can never attain such extensive views of human life, and so\ncorrect a judgment of good and ill, as the right application of this\nprinciple requires\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 164). Reid\u2019s point\nhere is that a principle of action should be action-guiding. It should\nbe the sort of thing that, in a wide range of cases, an agent could\nconsult when determining what to do and thereby come to understand\nwhat she morally ought to do. The principles of morality are\naction-guiding. \u201cEvery man of common understanding,\u201d says\nReid, is such that he is capable of knowing his duty (EAP V.i: 277).\nBut gaining a conception of one\u2019s good on the whole, let alone\nan accurate one, and an understanding of what genuinely contributes to\nit, is something that is very difficult to do. It requires that one\n\u201cobserve the connections of things, and the consequences of our\nactions,\u201d thereby \u201ctaking an extended view of our\nexistence, past, present, and future\u201d (EAP III.iii.i: 153). Many\nordinary persons will have neither the time nor the ability to do\nthis, let alone actually gain an accurate notion of that in which\ntheir good on the whole consists. If this is right, however, then\none\u2019s good on the whole is not sufficiently action-guiding to be\nthe most general and fundamental principle of action, as eudaimonists\nclaim.\n\nSecond, since one\u2019s good on the whole is concerned not only with\npresent satisfaction, but also with the enjoyment of future goods, it\nproves not to be as motivationally charged as one might hope. We would\nlike to have a clearer and more efficacious guide to conduct. Reid\nputs the point thus:\n\nMen stand in need of a sharper monitor to their duty than a dubious\nview of distant good. There is reason to believe, that a present sense\nof duty has, in many cases a stronger influence than the apprehension\nof distant good would have of itself. And it cannot be doubted, that a\nsense of guilt and demerit is a more pungent reprover than the bare\napprehension of having mistaken our true interest. (EAP III.iii.iv:\n165)\n\n\nDuty is, then, according to Reid, in many cases, a better guide to\naction than interest. Moreover, it is often motivationally more\npowerful than an appeal to interest, as it connects more intimately\nwith powerful motivating considerations such as one\u2019s own\nguilt.\n\nThe third point that Reid makes is that \u201ca steady pursuit of our\nown good may, in an enlightened mind, produce a kind of virtue which\nis entitled to some degree of approbation, yet it can never produce\nthe noblest kind of virtue, which claims our highest love and\nesteem\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 165). So, Reid\u2019s view is not that\na concern for one\u2019s own well-being is crass egoism or\nself-centeredness. To the contrary, there is something admirable about\nit; to pursue one\u2019s own well-being properly requires virtue. For\nexample, if concern for one\u2019s self is such that it helps one to\ndiscount temptations to a life of ease, leisure, or frivolity, then it\nis much to be admired (cf. EAP III.iii.iv: 165; but also cf. EAP V.vi:\n272). That said, to be genuinely dedicated to the moral life, one\ncannot grant motivational primacy to one\u2019s good on the whole.\nFor our esteem, Reid writes, \u201cis due only to the man whose soul\nis not contracted within itself, but embraces a more extensive object:\nwho loves virtue, not for her dowry only, but for her own sake: whose\nbenevolence is not selfish, but generous and disinterested\u201d (EAP\nIII.iii.iv: 166). For Reid, then, virtue requires caring not only\nabout particular persons (they are, according to Reid, the objects of\nbenevolence), but also about virtue itself. Being virtuous requires\nbeing committed to the idea that the moral life is, in and for itself,\nworth living. It is not to be made subordinate to considerations about\none\u2019s well-being.\n\nReid\u2019s fourth point echoes one of Butler\u2019s most famous\nobservations regarding the pursuit of happiness: If one primarily aims\nto secure one\u2019s own happiness, one often increases the risk of\nnot obtaining it. This is not only because directly aiming for\none\u2019s own happiness can \u201cfill the mind with fear, and\ncare, and anxiety\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 167). It is also because a\n\u201cconcern for our own good is not a principle that, of itself,\ngives any enjoyment\u201d (EAP III.iii.iv: 166). What does give\nenjoyment, however, are those particular activities and objects to\nwhich our affections are directed, such as friendship and the common\ngood. To achieve one\u2019s good on the whole, then, one must, at\nleast part of the time, be focused on and motivated by considerations\nthat are not identical with it.\n\nEarlier we said that a consideration has motivational primacy for an\nagent just in case the following three conditions are met: First, it\nis a type of consideration in light of which an ordinary adult agent\nwould act in a wide array of cases; second, it is a sufficient reason\nfor that agent; and, third it has deliberative weight for him.\nEudaimonists believe that one\u2019s good on the whole has\nmotivational primacy. Indeed, they believe that one\u2019s good on\nthe whole has motivational primacy in a very robust sense.\nEudaimonists hold that every act that an agent performs is,\nor should be, taken for the sake of his own happiness and that there\nis, or should be, no deeper practical justification for so acting.\nReid maintains that eudaimonism thus understood is false. In many\ncases, agents do not act for the sake of their good on the whole. Nor,\nin many cases, should they do so. For one thing, appealing to\none\u2019s good on the whole is insufficiently action-guiding, since\nmany agents simply do not have an adequate understanding of that in\nwhich it consists. For another, to make happiness the final court of\nappeal when deliberating is to undermine the rightful primacy of\nvirtue.\n\nThere is a substantial challenge facing views such as Reid\u2019s.\nConsider a case in which considerations of well-being conflict with\nduty, such as when moral duty requires that one stand up for the\ninnocent at the cost of one\u2019s life and those of one\u2019s\nfamily. Reid is committed to the claim that, in a case such as this,\none is required to surrender one\u2019s life. Could that be right?\nReid insists that it is. For any such conflict, Reid says, is\n\u201cimaginary\u201d (EAP III.iii.viii: 194). So long as \u201cthe\nworld is under a wise and benevolent administration, it is impossible,\nthat any man should \u2026 be a loser by doing his duty.\u201d\nReid\u2019s theism, in short, grounds his allegiance to The Hierarchy\nThesis. God guarantees that the two principles of action never come\ninto genuine conflict since performing one\u2019s duty will not\ndetract from one\u2019s good on the whole in the long run (see Cuneo\n2010).\n3. Moral Principles\n\nAccording to the picture sketched thus far, Reid\u2019s account of\nautonomous action is as follows: We human beings can act from a great\nvariety of principles, including the so-called mechanical and animal\nprinciples. What renders us rational agents distinct from the rest of\nthe animals is our ability to gain critical distance from these\nincentives and regulate our conduct by appeal to the two rational\nprinciples of action, asking whether a given course of action truly\ncontributes to our good on the whole and is consonant with moral duty.\nFinally, the principle of duty enjoys motivational primacy. Although I\nhave not yet emphasized the point, the similarities between\nReid\u2019s and Kant\u2019s thought in these respects are\nunmistakable. (We have, however, no evidence that Reid was aware of\nKant\u2019s work.) According to both Reid and Kant, we are rational\nbeings not primarily because we can engage in means-end practical\nreasoning. Rather, we are practically rational agents primarily\nbecause we can assess the various impulses to act by appeal to a\n\u201ccertain general principle\u201d or law \u2013 this law\nconsisting, in Reid\u2019s view, in the rational principles of\naction. Indeed, if J. B. Schneewind is correct, Reid and Kant were\nunique among the moderns inasmuch as that they conceived of morality\nprimarily in terms of rational self-governance (see Schneewind\n1998).\n\nStill, we saw earlier that there is an important difference between\nReid and Kant. Kant is an ethical monist, holding that there is one\nmaster principle of morality\u2014the categorical\nimperative\u2014which is fundamental and from which all our\nparticular duties can be derived. Reid, by contrast, rejects ethical\nmonism, maintaining that there is no such master principle, but only a\nvariety of moral principles that are self-evident and irreducible to\none another. The locution \u201cthe principle of duty,\u201d in\nReid\u2019s mouth, is probably best understood to be a shorthand way\nof referring to one or another of these principles which can govern\npractical deliberation.\n\nIn his chapter \u201cOf the first principles of morals,\u201d Reid\npresents the first principles of morality \u201cwithout pretending to\na complete enumeration\u201d (EAP V.i: 270). The constellation of\nprinciples that Reid presents is a hodgepodge. Some are metaethical\nprinciples that specify certain properties of moral principles, such\nas that they apply only to free actions, while others are normative\nprinciples that one might consult when deliberating. Among the\nnormative principles that Reid presents are these:\n\n\nWe ought to prefer a greater good, though more distant, to a less; and\na less evil to the greater.\n\nEvery man ought to consider himself as member of the common society of\nmankind, and of the subordinate societies to which he belongs, such as\nfamily, friends, neighborhood, and country, and do as much good as he\ncan, and as little hurt to the societies of which he is a part.\n\nIn every case, we ought to act that part toward another, which we\nwould judge to be right in him to act toward us, if we were in his\ncircumstance and he in ours. (EAP V.i)\n\n\nPrinciples such as these, Reid says, form a system of morality, but\nonly in a weak sense. They form a system only in the sense that we can\norganize them in such a way that facilitates \u201capprehension and\nmemory.\u201d In this respect, a system of morals, according to Reid,\nis not like a system of geometry \u201cwhere the subsequent parts\nderive their evidence from the preceding\u201d but \u201cresembles\nmore a system of botany \u2026 where the subsequent parts depend not\nfor their evidence upon the preceding\u201d (EAP V.ii: 281). So,\nwhile Reid admits that the last principle stated above is the\n\u201cmost comprehensive,\u201d he does not claim that it is\nfundamental in the sense that it grounds the other moral principles.\nRather, he holds that each of the principles of morality is\nself-evident, at least to those who have a sound understanding, a\nsatisfactory moral education, and are not in the grip of self-interest\nor passion. These principles are self-evident, in part, because they\nare not amenable to direct argument or proof, for any such argument\n\u201cwill either take for granted the thing to be proved\u201d or\nbe \u201csomething not more evident\u201d (EAP V.i: 361; for more\ndiscussion, see Cuneo 2004, 259 and Davis 2006, Ch. 6).\n\nThose familiar with the history of ethical intuitionism know that its\ncritics have found the view unsatisfactory because the intuitionists\nhad almost nothing informative to say about why, in a given situation,\na particular moral principle takes precedence, and how we could know\nthat it did (see McNaughton 1996). In hindsight, it is remarkable that\nReid shows little interest in this problem, stating that it is usually\nclear to a candid mind which moral principles take precedence and what\none should do (see EAP V.i; although see Roeser 2010a, 15\u201316).\nInstead, Reid is more concerned to argue that there must be\nfirst-principles of morality. In his argument for this claim, Reid\nappeals to a traditional regress-style argument according to which\nthere must be some fundamental moral principles which both ground and\njustify our moral deliberation on pain of our being unable to engage\nin such deliberation, which we clearly can (see EAP V.i).\n\nAt first glance, this can give the impression that moral judgments\nmust, in Reid\u2019s view, derive their warrant from moral first\nprinciples, presumably by being inferred from them. Although Reid\nmight encourage this impression in places, in other places he clearly\nindicates that this is not how he views things. In his account of\nparticular moral judgments, for example, Reid insists that we\nordinarily form them immediately or non-inferentially. A moderately\nvirtuous agent \u201cwill rarely be at a loss to distinguish good\nfrom ill in his own conduct, without the labour of reasoning\u201d\n(EAP V.ii: 280). If the first principles of morality were\nwarrant-conferring axioms, however, this presumably would not be the\ncase (see Cuneo 2014).\n\nSuppose, then, that in Reid\u2019s view appeal to moral first\nprinciples rarely plays a role in the formation of particular moral\njudgments. It is natural to wonder about the role Reid envisions moral\nfirst principles to play in ordinary moral thought. On this matter,\nReid says less than one might like. A promising strategy of\ninterpretation, however, is to draw a parallel between the first\nprinciples of morality, on the one hand, and what Reid says about the\nfirst principles of common sense in the Inquiry and\nEssays on the Intellectual Powers, on the other.\n\nIn his discussion of the principles of common sense, Reid presents\nvarious first principles, including the claims that memory is reliable\nand that those things exist that we distinctly perceive. Although\nsometimes he seems to claim that our particular perceptual judgments\nare derived from them, a closer look at what Reid says makes it clear\nthat this is not his considered view. For, in Reid\u2019s view,\nordinary perceptual judgments are formed non-inferentially and are not\nself-evident. What role, then, do these principles of common sense\nplay? Nicholas Wolterstorff (2001, Ch. IX and 2004) argues that Reid\nthinks of such principles as being similar to what Wittgenstein, in\nOn Certainty, called \u201cframework propositions.\u201d\nThey are propositions that ordinary people do not typically explicitly\nbelieve but rather take for granted in their everyday comings and\ngoings. Similarly, one might hold that, properly understood,\nReid\u2019s view is that the moral first-principles are not\npropositions that ordinary agents who have received a decent moral\neducation ordinarily consciously believe at some time or other.\nRather, they are what these agents take for granted in their moral\ndeliberations; they form the horizon or background against which they\ndeliberate\u2014although these agents would, presumably, assent to\nthem if they were explicitly presented (for an alternative but, in\nprinciple, complimentary account, see Davis 2006, Ch. 6).\n\nBe that as it may, Reid\u2019s deep impulse for affirming the\nexistence of these principles is not so much to reply to traditional\nworries about stopping a regress of reasons as to make an anti-Humean\npoint. (Hume, after all, also accepts the regress argument; see EAP\nV.vii.) According to Reid\u2019s construal of it, the aim of Humean\npractical reason is not to determine the ends that we should have, but\nmerely to ascertain how most effectively to satisfy our passions (EAP\nIII.iii.i: 153; cf. also EAP II.ii: 54). Reid, by contrast, takes it\nto be evident that we can form a conception of our good on the whole\nand regulate our actions in accordance with it. But if we can do this,\nReid contends, then Hume\u2019s account of practical reason cannot be\ncorrect. We can reason not just about means but also ends. Moreover,\nif Reid is correct and it is the province of reason to form a\nconception of one\u2019s good on the whole, then Hume\u2019s more\nextravagant claims about reason also cannot be correct. For, if Reid\nis right, not only is it reason\u2019s province to form a notion of\none\u2019s good upon the whole, it is also its role to guide action\nin such a way that it is conducive to one\u2019s own good. It cannot\nbe true, then, that it is not contrary to reason for an agent to\nprefer his lesser good to his greater, as Hume claimed.\n3.1 Reid\u2019s defense of the objectivity of moral first principles\n\nSo far, then, we have a sense of what, according to Reid, the first\nprinciples of morality are and the roles that Reid wished them to\nplay. What should be added is that Reid thinks them to be objective in\na fairly strong sense. Or to put things somewhat more guardedly, if we\ninterpret Reid\u2019s claims that motives do not exist to mean only\nthat they do not exist in space/time, then Reid thinks they are\nobjective in a fairly robust sense (for different interpretations, see\nDavid 1985, Nichols 2002, Yaffe 2004, and Van Cleve 2015, ch. 10).\n\nIn the first place, Reid believes that the fundamental moral\nprinciples cannot be the product of convention. His argument in this\ncase is directed against Hume. In Reid\u2019s view, Hume defends a\nconventionalist account of justice, which rides on a quasi-genetic\naccount of the emergence of the norms of justice. According to\nHume\u2019s story, we begin with a notion of our good on the whole.\nOut of a concern to secure our good on the whole, we create the rules\nof justice by convention. In response, Reid notes that to have the\nconcept of one\u2019s good on the whole, one must also have the\nconcepts of \u2018being a favor\u2019 and \u2018being an\ninjury.\u2019 These concepts, however, are \u201cearly in the mind\nof man as any rational notion whatever\u201d (EAP V.v: 309). Reid\ncontends that Hume would seem also to be committed to as much. Hume,\nafter all, believes gratitude and resentment to be\n\u201cnatural\u201d sentiments that are concerned with favors and\ninjuries. Call those concepts that cluster around the notion of\njustice, such as \u2018being wronged,\u2019 \u2018being what is\ndeserved,\u2019 and \u2018being that to which one is\nentitled,\u2019 our concepts of primary justice. Reid argues\nthat Hume\u2019s quasi-genetic story faces a problem, for a person\ncannot have the concepts \u2018being a favor\u2019 and \u2018being\nan injury\u2019 without first having the concepts of primary\njustice.\n\nConsider favors. Favors, says Reid, are naturally connected with the\nbenevolent affection of gratitude; they are what merit this response.\nBut to express gratitude toward someone who has performed a favor is\nto believe or presuppose that that agent has benefited you by going\nbeyond what is owed. Or consider being injured (as opposed to simply\nbeing harmed). Being injured, says Reid, is naturally connected with\nthe malevolent affection of resentment. To express resentment toward\nan agent who has injured you is, however, to believe or presuppose\nthat he has wronged you, given you less than you deserve. If this is\nright, we do not derive the primary concepts of justice from an\ninterest to secure our good on the whole. To the contrary, the reverse\nis true; we can arrive at a notion of our own good on the whole only\nif we possess the concepts of primary justice. But if so, we cannot\nhold that we somehow constructed our notions and the rules of justice\nfrom a concern to secure our good on the whole. Our notion of our good\non the whole presupposes them (see Cuneo 2015 and Powell and Yaffe\n2015).\n\nIn fact, Reid believes that reflection on our concepts of primary\njustice reveals more than this. It also reveals that these concepts\nare irreducible to other normative concepts and fundamental to moral\nthinking. Reid\u2019s way of making this point is to note that Hume\nattempts to ground the rules of justice not just in our notion of our\ngood on the whole, but also in considerations of utility. Reid holds\nthat this is a mistake. To \u201chave the conception of\njustice,\u201d it is necessary that \u201cone perceive its\nobligation distinct from its utility\u201d (EAP V.v: 306).\nConsiderations of utility, Reid holds, are the wrong sort of reasons\nto ground accountability relations, which are among the objects of our\nconcepts of primary justice. In his book, The Second-Person\nStandpoint, Stephen Darwall puts the point like this: To see that\nsomething is required of another is to take up the\n\u201csecond-person standpoint\u201d with regard to him. To occupy\nthis standpoint is to have the authority to hold that person\naccountable for not doing what is required of him. Failure to perform\nan act that increases utility, however, is not the right sort of thing\nfor which to hold someone accountable (see Darwall 2006, especially\nthe discussion of Reid in Ch. 8; see also Wolterstorff 2010).\n\nIn addition to rejecting moral constructivist accounts of justice,\nReid rejects what we today would call response-dependent accounts of\nmoral facts. Roughly put, response-dependent views, which Reid\nattributes to sentimentalists such as Hutcheson and Hume, maintain\nthat moral reality is determined by the sorts of affective reactions\nwe have to the world. It is because certain actions and events elicit\ncertain types of affective states in us that they have properties such\nas being wrong or being obligatory. Drawing upon\nwhat rationalists such as Balguy and Price had argued, Reid asks us to\nconsider fundamental moral principles, such as the claim that, in\nordinary conditions, an agent ought to honor his promise. Claims such\nas this, Reid says, are necessarily true. But if the\nresponse-dependent view were correct, it is difficult to see how that\ncould be so. After all, we can imagine being constituted in such a way\nthat we failed to disapprove of those who do not honor their promises.\nIf the response-dependent view were true, then in those counterfactual\ncircumstances honoring one\u2019s promises would not be obligatory;\nfailing to honor them, accordingly, would not be wrong. But that is\nfalse, for basic moral principles do not exhibit this sort of\ncontingency. Even in those counterfactual conditions it would be wrong\nnot to honor one\u2019s word. If so, sentimentalists views, Reid\nconcludes, are false (see EIP VI.vi: 494\u201395).\n4. The Moral Sense\n\nWe noted earlier that contemporary philosophers tend to think of\nmodern philosophers as being either rationalists or sentimentalists\nabout morality. We also noted that Reid does not fit comfortably in\neither category, as his views tend to blend together both rationalist\nand sentimentalist commitments. This becomes especially evident in\nReid\u2019s discussion of the moral sense. (See Davis 2006 for a\ndiscussion of how Reid\u2019s account of the moral sense is\ninfluenced by the legal practices of his day.)\n\nIt was Francis Hutcheson who first developed the claim that we are\nendowed with a moral sense. While Hutcheson\u2019s position has been\nvariously interpreted, his considered position appears to run as\nfollows. Rationalists tell us that our moral judgments are the output\nof reason. But many of our ordinary, nonmoral judgments are not the\noutput of reason. Our perceptual judgments concerning the external\nworld, our judgments about our own pain and pleasure, and our\naesthetic judgments, for example, are not the products of reason.\nRather, they are the products of various \u201csenses\u201d or\n\u201cdeterminations of our minds to receive Ideas independently of\nour Will\u201d (ONC, 17). Moral judgments, Hutcheson claims, are no\ndifferent in this respect. They are also the product not of reason but\nof a sense, in this case, the moral sense. Although Hutcheson\nhimself describes this sense in different ways, it is probably best to\nthink of it as a faculty that has two basic functions.\n\nIn the first place, it is that faculty by which we form moral ideas or\nconcepts and in such a way that does not involve any sort of reasoning\nor calculation. Rather, the \u201cauthor of Nature\u201d has\ndesigned us in such a way that, in a certain range of circumstances,\nwhen an agent is aware of the behavior of himself or others, this\nawareness evokes in him states of approbation. These states of\napprobation, in turn, elicit states of love and esteem for the person\nwhose behavior of which he\u2019s aware. States of approbation,\nHutcheson indicates, thus function as signs of an\nagent\u2019s benevolence, indicating its presence. Love and esteem,\nby contrast, do not indicate benevolence but are rather appropriate\naffective responses to it. Second, these affective states move us to\nbenevolent action. The moral sense at once puts us in contact with\nmoral reality and motivates us to act (see Cuneo 2013; Kail 2007).\n4.1 Reid\u2019s view compared with Hutcheson\u2019s\n\nThose familiar with Reid\u2019s writing on perception will\nimmediately notice rather striking similarities between\nHutcheson\u2019s account of the moral sense and Reid\u2019s account\nof external sense. To see this, consider a case of ordinary tactile\nperception, such as when one perceives that the table before one is\nhard by touching it. In cases such as these, how do we perceive the\ntable\u2019s hardness? According to Reid, in such cases, it is\npressure sensations\u2014which, Reid stresses, largely go unnoticed\nand unnamed\u2014that immediately produce in us a \u201cconception\nand belief\u201d of the table that it is hard. As such, Reid says,\nthe best explanation of how we perceive things such as a table\u2019s\nhardness is that the \u201cAuthor of our Nature\u201d has designed\nus in such a way that, when all goes well, feelings of a certain range\nfunction as signs or indicators of it. (God, Reid emphasizes, could\nhave easily fashioned us in such a way that the perceptual process\nworked differently. For all we reasonably believe, God could have\nconstructed us in such a way that signs of an entirely different sort,\nsuch as noises or smells of a certain range, indicate a table\u2019s\nhardness.) Reid stresses that, according to this account of\nperception, pressure sensations are not ideas in the sense that Locke\nor Hume thought of them. For pressure sensations do not function as\nintermediaries of which we are aware that imagistically represent the\ntable\u2019s hardness and from which we infer its existence.\n\nIn order to explain judgments of these sorts, then, both Hutcheson and\nReid appeal not to reason but to an indigenous sense with which we\ncome hardwired. Both thinkers maintain that (in the ordinary case)\ninference plays no role in the production of such\njudgments\u2014feelings being such as to immediately evoke them.\nBoth, moreover, offer thoroughly teleological accounts of perception,\nwhich appeal to the plan of the \u201cAuthor of our nature.\u201d\nAnd, finally, both champion semiotic accounts of perceptual judgment\nformation. According to the relevant design plans, sensations or\nfeelings of various kinds play the role of being signs for or\nindicators of qualities of things in the world.\n\nAt various points, Reid himself highlights the similarities between\nthe two senses (see EAP III.iii.vi: 179\u201380 and PE, 144). Having\nnoted these similarities, however, Reid goes on to claim that there is\nalso an important disanalogy between the judgments produced by\nexternal sense, on the one hand, and the moral sense, on the other: In\nthe former case, when all goes well, feelings elicit judgments about\nthe external world. In the latter case, the order of explanation is\nreversed: \u201cIn the approbation of a good action \u2026 there is\nfeeling indeed, but there is also esteem of the agent; and both the\nfeeling and the esteem depend upon the judgment we form of his\nconduct,\u201d not vice-versa (EAP V.vii: 349; for discussion, see\nBroadie 1998 and Cuneo 2006). By stressing that states of approbation\nare not mere feelings but include full-blooded moral judgments, Reid\ntakes himself to have corrected a deficiency in Hutcheson\u2019s\nview. For while Hutcheson nowhere denies that the outputs of the moral\nsense include the acceptance of moral propositions neither does he\naffirm this. Rather, what Hutcheson tells us is that states of\napprobation are feelings of pleasure and that they yield\n\u201clove\u201d for the benevolent. But Hutcheson, Reid points out,\nsays next to nothing about this latter state, never specifying whether\nit includes moral propositional content. By explicitly specifying that\nthe outputs of the moral sense have moral propositional\ncontent\u2014indeed, a wide range of such contents\u2014Reid takes\nhimself to have identified more accurately the character of its\noutputs.\n\nLet us pull these strands of argument together. Both Hutcheson and\nReid, we\u2019ve seen, maintain that we come equipped with a moral\nsense that bears certain resemblances to external sense. The Reidian\nmoral sense differs in two important respects, however, from the\nHutchesonian one. First, the outputs of the Reidian moral sense\ninclude not only moral conceptions, but also full-blooded moral\nbeliefs with moral propositional content. (Reid, incidentally,\nunderstood Hume to deny that moral judgments have moral propositional\ncontent; for his attack on this view, see EAP V.vii and Cuneo 2004).\nThese moral beliefs themselves concern not only general moral truths,\nsuch as the moral first principles, but also particular ones, such as\nthat this particular person\u2019s behavior merits approbation.\n\nSecond, we have seen that Reid reverses the order of explanation\nbetween sentiment and moral judgment. In the paradigmatic case, moral\njudgments elicit moral sentiments, not vice-versa. Although Reid\nreverses Hutcheson\u2019s order of explanation claim, he still thinks\nof a range of particular moral judgments as being cases of moral\nperception. His basic approach is to claim that, in moral perception,\nit is not sentiments that function as signs of moral properties.\nRather, it is the behavior and countenance of agents that play this\nrole. Roughly, the guiding idea is that moral properties of a certain\nrange attach to the mental states of agents such as their beliefs,\ndesires, and intentions. For example, the property being kind\ncan attach to an agent\u2019s intention to perform a certain act.\nThese mental states and their properties manifest themselves in the\nbehavior and countenance of agents. Ordinary mature agents are so\nconstituted that, when all goes well, upon becoming aware of the\nbehavior and countenance of these agents, this awareness\nnon-inferentially evokes in us the conception and belief of those\nagents that they have properties such as being kind,\ndeceitful, faithful, and so forth. In this regard,\nmoral perception exhibits the same fundamental structure as our\nperception of what Reid calls visible figure, such as an\nobject\u2019s length and height (see Cuneo 2003, 2006, Kroeker 2010,\nCopenhaver 2014). In both cases, features of our environment function\nas signs for a given quality, these signs being such as to\nnon-inferentially produce conception and belief. Here is how Reid\nhimself puts the point:\n\n\nIntelligence, design, and skill, are not objects of the external\nsenses, nor can we be conscious of them in any person but\nourselves\u2026.\n\nA man\u2019s wisdom is known to us only by the signs of it in his\nconduct; his eloquence by the signs of it in his speech. In the same\nmanner we judge of his virtue, of his fortitude, and of all his\ntalents and qualities of mind.\n\nYet it is to be observed, that we judge of men\u2019s talents with as\nlittle doubt or hesitation as we judge of the immediate objects of\nsense.\n\n\u2026 We perceive one man to be open, another cunning; one to be\nignorant, another very knowing; one to be slow of understanding,\nanother quick. Every man forms such judgments of those he converses\nwith; and the common affairs of life depend upon such judgments. We\ncan as little avoid them as we can avoid seeing what is before our\neyes.\n\nFrom this it appears, that it is no less part of the human\nconstitution, to judge of men\u2019s characters, and of their\nintellectual powers, from the signs of them in their actions and\ndiscourse, than to judge of corporeal objects by our senses. (EIP\nVI.vi: 503\u20134)\n\n\nIt is Reid\u2019s view, then, that we can apprehend both the external\nworld and moral reality. He also holds that the beliefs formed on the\nbasis of these apprehensions are generally in good epistemic order.\nSo, in the case of our perception of external objects, Reid rejects\nskepticism. Admittedly, Reid says, we may lack a complete explanation\nof how we become aware of external reality. But this, says Reid, is no\nreason to doubt that we can in fact apprehend it.\n\nIn fact, Reid claims, there are powerful reasons to reject skepticism\nabout external sense. For consider our indigenous or\n\u201coriginal\u201d epistemic faculties such as memory,\nintrospection, reasoning, and perception. The outputs of these\nfaculties include judgments of various sorts\u2014judgments about\nwhat happened, what one is feeling, what to conclude given one\u2019s\nevidence, and so forth. The practices of forming these judgments are\nsocially well-established over time. Indeed, they are so deeply\nentrenched that engaging in them is, for all practical purposes,\ninescapable; we cannot avoid forming memory judgments, introspective\njudgments, perceptual judgments, and so forth. Moreover, we have\nsophisticated methods of evaluating judgments made in these domains,\nincluding ways of checking their reliability and the appeal to experts\nof various sorts. Finally, many of the judgments made in these domains\nare not subject to systemic disagreement among competent participants.\nBy and large, our judgments about the external world, for example,\nconverge.\n\nShould we trust the deliverance of indigenous faculties of this sort?\nIn one of his better known dialectal maneuvers, Reid claims that we\nshould. For, Reid says, our situation is this. If we didn\u2019t\ntrust any of our indigenous faculties, we would face wholesale\nskepticism. Our most basic processes of reasoning would be rationally\nundercut, for we could not trust their deliverances. If we trust only\nsome but not all of our original faculties, then Reid claims we are\nbeing arbitrarily partial. Given that these faculties exhibit similar\nfeatures, what reason could we have\u2014at least at the outset of\ntheorizing\u2014for trusting one but not the other? In a well-known\npassage, Reid puts the point like this:\n\nReason, says the sceptic, is the only judge of truth, and you ought to\nthrow off every opinion and every belief that is not grounded on\nreason. Why, Sir, should I believe the faculty of reason more than\nthat of perception; they came both out of the same shop, and were made\nby the same artist; and if he puts one piece of false ware into my\nhands, what should hinder him from putting another? (IHM VI.xx: 169)\n\n\nReid continues in this vein, noting that trusting our indigenous\nfaculties does not imply that we must suppose that they operate\nflawlessly:\n\nThere is no more reason to account our senses fallacious, than our\nreason, our memory, or any other faculty of judging which nature hath\ngiven us. They are all limited and imperfect\u2026. We are liable to\nerror and wrong judgment in the use of them all; but as little in the\ninformations of sense as in the deductions of reasoning. (EIP II.xxii:\n251\u201352; for discussion, see Greco 2002 and 2004)\n\n4.2 Reid\u2019s defense of the reliability of the moral sense\n\nIn Essays on the Active Powers, Reid extends this line of\nargument to the moral sense. The fact that we have no well-worked out\ntheory of how we form moral judgments does not itself rationally\nundercut the epistemic status of these judgments (see EAP V.ii:\n282\u201383). More importantly, the moral sense, Reid argues, is also\nindigenous. All normal human beings raised in a normal environment\nhave it. Moreover, its outputs include judgments of various\nsorts\u2014judgments about what is wrong, right, approbation-worthy,\nand so forth. The practice of forming moral judgments is, furthermore,\nsocially well-established over time. In fact, it is so deeply\nentrenched that it is, for all practical purposes, inescapable; try as\nwe might, we cannot avoid forming moral judgments. We also have\nsophisticated methods of evaluating moral judgments, such as appeals\nto what we today would call reflective equilibrium (see EAP\nIII.iii.vi). Finally, many moral judgments\u2014in particular, those\nthat concern the first principles\u2014are not subject to systemic\ndisagreement among competent participants. By and large, in\nReid\u2019s view, our judgments about these principles converge (see\nEAP III.iii.vi; for discussion, see Cuneo 2011b, 2011c and Levy 1999.\nDavis 2006 and 2010 explore Reid\u2019s treatment of moral\ndisagreement).\n\nGiven all this, Reid contends that we should reject moral skepticism.\nAt the outset of inquiry, the deliverances of the moral faculty, like\nthe deliverances of our other indigenous cognitive faculties, deserve\nan innocent until proven guilty status. Unlike Ross after him, Reid\nseems to think that our beliefs about not only moral first principles\nbut also particular cases can count as instances of knowledge.\n\nTo this point, we have seen important respects in which Reid\u2019s\naccount of the moral sense both articulates with and deviates from\nHutcheson\u2019s. On the one hand, Reid is, like Hutcheson, concerned\nto distance his view from the rationalists, who come very close to\ncharacterizing moral knowledge as a species of ordinary theoretical\nknowledge such as that achieved in mathematics. On the other, Reid\nalso wants to correct certain deficiencies in the sentimentalist\nprogram, such as the tendency to drive a sharp wedge between reason\nand \u201csense\u201d and to think of the deliverances of the moral\nsense as mere feelings. This allows Reid to defend the claim that the\nmoral sense is reliable in a perfectly straightforward sense.\n\nStill, while Reid wishes to emphasize that the moral sense issues in\nbona fide moral judgments, he also emphasizes that it issues in more\nthan mere moral judgments. Reid writes: \u201cOur moral judgments are\nnot, like those we form in speculative matters, dry and unaffecting,\nbut from their nature, are necessarily accompanied with affections and\nfeelings \u2026\u201d (EAP III.iii.vii: 180). Reid calls the\ncomplex state that combines moral judgment, affection, and feeling\n\u201cmoral approbation.\u201d\n\nMoral approbation, then, comprises three elements: moral judgment,\naffection, and feeling. Reid is clear that the moral judgments in\nquestion are not general ones that concern the first principles of\nmorals, but particular judgments that concern whether someone has\nbehaved well or badly or exemplifies a virtue or vice. The affections\nthat accompany them are, in turn, dispositions \u201cto do good or\nhurt to others,\u201d which have a de re structure since\nthey have \u201cpersons, and not things\u201d [i.e., propositions]\nas their immediate object (EAP III.iii.iv: 107). Finally, Reid accepts\na minimalist account of the feelings that comprise moral approbation.\nFeelings such as pleasure and pain, in Reid\u2019s view, have no\nintentional object; they are not about anything. Rather, they are, as\nit were, adverbial modifiers of mental states and events: one esteems\nanother pleasurably or disapproves of another painfully. By\ndistinguishing approbation from feeling, Reid clearly rejects the\nposition according to which (what we today would call) desires are to\nbe identified with feelings of one or another sort.\n\nIt is not difficult to discern the theoretical work that this account\nof moral approbation is supposed to do for Reid. Under a natural\nreading, in both the Treatise and the second\nEnquiry, Hume charged rational intuitionists with having no\naccount of why moral judgments, which are the output of reason, should\nhave such an intimate connection with motivation. Reid\u2019s answer\nto this challenge is to \u201cgo nativist\u201d: We are so\nconstituted that when we judge that, say, an action is unjust, we are\nmoved to action. That the moral sense should yield both judgments and\nmotivational states is built into its functional profile or design\nplan. By emphasizing that this is how things go in the moral realm,\nReid takes himself to employ a strategy he has used elsewhere in his\nelaboration of our perception of the external world.\n\nRecall in this regard Reid\u2019s account of tactile perception. In\nthe case of tactile perception, Reid says that given certain\nexperiential inputs, such as the pressure sensations evoked upon\ntouching a table, we form judgments about the hardness of the table.\nThe pressure sensations function as signs of the table\u2019s\nhardness, which immediately evoke the judgment in question. According\nto this account, there are no mental images or \u201cideas\u201d\nfrom which we infer the hardness of the table. Likewise, in the moral\ncase, we are presented with various kinds of experiential inputs such\nas the behavior and countenance of agents. These experiential inputs\nfunction as signs, immediately evoking in us moral judgments of\nvarious sorts. When all goes well, these judgments, in turn, yield\naffection and feelings of various sorts. Once again, there are no\nideas from which we infer moral judgments and the process of judgment\nformation is itself noninferential. By emphasizing the similarities\nbetween these two cases, we have seen that Reid takes himself to\ndefend an account of moral perception. It is an account, in\nReid\u2019s view, which blends together the most promising features\nof both the rationalist and sentimentalist traditions (see Cuneo\n2007a, forthcoming b). For it implies both that moral judgments\nexpress genuine moral propositional content and that these judgments\nbear an intimate connection with moral motivation.\n5. Conclusion\n\nReid\u2019s view is a version of agency-centered ethical\nintuitionism. The view is agency-centered because Reid develops his\naccount of moral motives in light of his broadly agent causal account\nof agency and regulation account of autonomy, according to which our\nrational nature consists in our ability to regulate our conduct by\nappeal to the rational principles of action. This account of moral\nmotives, we have seen, borrows a great deal from the rationalists. The\nmoral first principles, says Reid, are self-evident necessary truths\nwhich are knowable to a person with a sound understanding, a decent\nmoral education, and not in the grip of distorting influences. Reid,\nhowever, was no ideologue, and freely borrowed from sentimentalists\nsuch as Hutcheson. In particular, he borrows from the sentimentalists\nthe conceptuality of the moral sense, which figures so importantly in\nhis work. The idea that the moral sense is at once an\ninformation-processing system whose deliverances are affective states\nthat move us to action, we\u2019ve seen, resembles closely what\nfigures such as Hutcheson claim. Finally, we have also seen that, at\nvarious points, Reid\u2019s thought coincides with Kant\u2019s. This\nis especially evident when one considers Reid\u2019s regulation\naccount of autonomy and his defense of what Darwall calls the\nsecond-person standpoint.\n\nRather few contemporary philosophers could accept all of Reid\u2019s\ncentral claims\u2014agent causation, teleological accounts of action,\nand occasionalism not being the dominant views of our day. Still, for\nthose who resonate with a broadly realist version of ethical\nnon-naturalism with emphases similar to Kant\u2019s, Reid\u2019s\nview is intriguing. Its resources remain to be mined.\n",
