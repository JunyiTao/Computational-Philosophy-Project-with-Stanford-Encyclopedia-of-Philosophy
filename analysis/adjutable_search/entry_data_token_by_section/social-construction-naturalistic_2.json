    "main_text": "What is Social Construction? || What is Constructed?\n1.2 What is Constructed?\n\nSocial constructionist claims are made about so many different objects\nthat it is perhaps not surprising to find that such claims have\ndifferent implications depending upon the different objects at which\nthey are directed. Most uses of \u201cconstruction\u201d-talk (and\nrelated talk to the effect that that objects are, surprisingly,\n\u201cinvented\u201d or \u201cmade up\u201d) are directed at three\nvery different sorts of entities: representations (e.g. ideas,\ntheories, concepts, accounts, taxonomies, and so forth),\n(non-representational) facts quite generally, and a special sort of\nnon-representational fact: facts about human traits.\n\nMost philosophical discussion of social constructionism has been\nconcerned with the so-called \u201cscience wars\u201d which means\nthat they have been concerned with evaluating the inference from the\nnumerous and complex social influences operating in the production of\nscientific theories to the social construction of the facts those\ntheories purport to represent, or to the failure of accounts of\nscientific rationality, or scientific realism, or scientific process\n(e.g. Laudan 1981, Nelson 1994, Fine 1996, Kukla 2000).\n\nBut \u201cconstruction\u201d talk has a more or less independent,\nbut equally contentious life in the \u201chuman nature wars\u201d\nwhere it labels the position that human traits (for example the\nemotions) or human kinds (which we can think of categories whose\nmembers share traits or clusters of traits, including, especially,\ndispositions to think and behave) are produced by culture rather than\nby biology or nature. \n\nThis kind constructionist view contrasts with the view that\nhuman kinds or traits are to be explained in terms of non-cultural\nmechanisms \u2013 especially internal, biological or natural states of the\norganism. The most pronounced disputes are prima facie concerned with\nwhether the clustering of traits in, for example, sex difference,\nemotional behavior, or mental illness, are caused by a cultural\npractice of differentiating persons or are instead caused by natural\nprocesses operating in relative independence from culture.\n\nBut this kind constructionist view has also (especially in the\nphilosophy of race) come to contrast with the skeptical view that a\nkind does not exist. In the context of race, constructionism amounts\nto the positive assertion that race is real even though it is not\nconstituted by, or grounded in, biological facts such as genetic\ndifference. (See, e.g., Haslanger 2012, Taylor 2013, Sundstrom 2002,\nOutlaw 1995, and the section \u201cRace: Do Races Exist? Contemporary\nPhilosophical Debates\u201d in the entry on\n race.)\n\nWe consider naturalistic approaches to the construction of\nrepresentations and human traits in more detail below, but it is\nuseful to first distinguish global constructionist claims\nthat hold that every fact is a social construction, from\nlocal constructionist claims that hold that only particular\nfacts\n are.[3]\n Because of their provocative nature, many philosophers associate the\nterm \u201csocial construction\u201d with a global thesis, and a\nstandard argument against global constructionism concerns whether such\na program is sustainable in the face of the regress such a global\nthesis engenders regarding the thesis of constructionism itself (e.g.\nBoghossian 2006, Kukla 2000). Philosophers may have focused on these\nmore radical claims in part because of the recognition that, relying\non something like the general idea of construction sketched above,\nclaims that are relatively global in scope are quite provocative and\nsurprising while claims that would count as locally socially\nconstructionist are quite familiar in many areas of philosophy,\nperhaps most importantly in meta-ethics, aesthetics, and social\nontology. The domain of social ontology is especially interesting\nbecause here many facts are widely recognized as social constructions:\nfor example, facts about being a U.S. Senator or a\nlicensed dog are social\n constructions.[4]\n Call such constructions overt\n constructions.[5]\n\nBut even local constructionist claims can be interesting to the extent\nthat they try to show some object may be produced by unacknowledged\nsocial practices\u2014when they are covert constructions.\nThis is the role that they play in the philosophy of psychiatry\n(Hacking 1995a, Scheff 1984, Showalter 1996, cf. Murphy 2006), the\nphilosophy of the emotions (Averill 1980a, 1980b, Armon-Jones 1986,\nHarr\u00e9 1986, cf. Griffiths 1997), the philosophy of race (e.g.\nOutlaw 1990, 1995; Mills 1998; Taylor 2013), and the philosophy of\ngender (see\n Feminist Theories of Sex and Gender: Gender as Socially Constructed).\n Here the local claim that some kind (for example mental\nillness, emotion, race, or gender) is\nexplained by received culture or practice retains its interest because\nit offers a metaphysical alternative to other explanations\n(biological, religious, etc.) of the differential features of the kind\nmembers as well as an alternative to skepticism about the reality of\nthe\n kind.[6]\n",
