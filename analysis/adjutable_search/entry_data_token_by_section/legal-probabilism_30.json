    "main_text": "Further Objections || Cohen\u2019s other objections\n7.2 Cohen\u2019s other objections\n\nCohen (1977) leveled a few other objections against legal probabilism.\nThey are less well-known than the paradoxes of naked statistical\nevidence or the conjunction paradox, but are still worth\nexamining.\n7.2.1 Completeness\n\nThe statement \\(\\Pr(\\neg H\\pmid E) = 1-\\Pr(H\\pmid E)\\) is a theorem of\nthe probability calculus. If the probability of \\(H\\) given \\(E\\) is\nlow, the probability of \\(\\neg H\\) given the same evidence must be\nhigh. This fact may seem to create evidence from ignorance. If \\(E\\)\nis meager evidence of \\(H\\) (that is, \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\) is low), it\nmust be strong evidence for the negation of \\(H\\) (that is, \\(\\Pr(\\neg\nH \\pmid E)\\) is high). This seems wrong. Intuitively, some evidence\ncan weakly support both a hypothesis and its negation. For example,\nsuppose one has heard a rumor that the defendant spent the night at\nthe bar when the crime was committed. The rumor is weak evidence for\nthe claim that the defendant spent the night at the bar. It does not\nfollow that the rumor is strong evidence that the defendant did\nnot spend the night at the bar. Evidence may actually have no\nbearing whatsoever on a hypothesis. Probability seems unable to\ncapture this fact, or at least this is the objection.\n\nThis difficulty motivated the development of a non-classical theory of\nprobability and evidential support by Dempster (1968) and Shafer\n(1976). Legal probabilists, however, need not reject classical\nprobability theory. They can respond that the difficulty just\ndescribed arises only because one is inclined to measure the strength\nof evidence in terms of the posterior probability \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\),\nrather than by means of the likelihood ratio (on this distinction, see\nearlier in\n Section 2).\n If \\(E\\) weakly supports \\(H\\)\u2014that is, the likeklihood ratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid \\neg H)}\\]\n\n\nis barely above one\u2014it does not follow that \\(E\\) strongly\nsupports \\(\\neg H\\). In fact, it rather follows follows that \\(E\\)\nweakly disfavors \\(\\neg H\\), because \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid \\neg H)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}\\]\n\n \nwill be slightly below one.\n7.2.2 Corroboration\n\nWhen two or more independent witnesses testify to the truth of the\nsame proposition, and their stories are relatively unlikely, the\nprobability of the proposition in question should increase\nsignificantly. This phenomenon of \u201cconfidence boost\u201d is\nknown as corroboration. In case of circumstantial evidence, the\nanalogous phenomenon is called convergence. Cohen (1977) argues that\nno probabilistic measure of evidential support captures this\nphenomenon. He examines different probabilistic\nproposals\u2014Boole\u2019s formula (Boole 1857),\nEkel\u00f6f\u2019s principle (Ekel\u00f6f 1964), a formula due to\nLambert and Kruskal (1988)\u2014and finds them inadequate. He argues\nthat the confidence boost that is expected from corroboration is not\nadequately captured by any of these proposals.\n\nMore recently, better probabilistic accounts of corroboration have\nbeen developed (Fenton and Neil 2013 [2018]; Robertson, Vignaux,\nand Berger 2016; Taroni et al. 2014). A recurrent theme in this line\nof work is that corroboration can be accounted for in probabilistic\nterms by multiplying the likelihood ratios of the individual pieces of\nevidence. The thought is that the result of multiplying the likelihood\nratios of different pieces of evidence combined exceeds the likelihood\nratios associated with the individual pieces of evidence (see general\ndiscussion in Bovens and Hartmann 2004: ch. 5). Cohen, however,\ninsisted that the confidence boost due to corroboration should be\nlarge, and the large boost is not reflected as a result of multiplying\nthe likelihood ratios. What needs further exploring is the size of the\nconfidence boost and the features of the evidence that affect the\nboost. Urbaniak and Janda (2020) offer a detailed discussion of\nCohen\u2019s objections and candidates for a solution.\n7.3 The problem of priors\n\nAnother objection often leveled against legal probabilism is the\nproblem of priors. This problem emerges as one sets out to assess the\nposterior probability of a hypothesis given the available evidence,\n\\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\).\n\nTo carry out the calculations, Bayes\u2019 theorem requires as a\nstarting point the prior probability of the hypothesis, \\(\\Pr(H)\\),\nirrespective of the evidence. The correct assessment of this prior\nprobability is by no means obvious. Different strategies have been\nproposed.\n\nFirst, the prior probability can be equated to \\(1/k\\) where \\(k\\) is\nthe number of alternative equiprobable hypotheses. If there are \\(k\\)\npossible hypotheses and no one is more probable than the other, it is\nnatural to assign \\(1/k\\) to each hypothesis. This approach, however,\nwould render prior probabilities quite sensitive to the choice of\nhypotheses and thus potentially arbitrary. In addition, this approach\nis particularly unsuitable for criminal cases. If two hypotheses are\n\u201cthe defendant is guilty\u201d and \u201cthe defendant is\ninnocent\u201d, the prior probability of each would be 50%.\nDefendants in criminal cases, however, should be presumed innocent\nuntil proven guilty. Prior probability of guilt at the level of .5\nseems excessive. The presumption of innocence\u2014a procedural\nprotection afforded to all defendants in many countries\u2014should\nrequire that the prior probability of guilt be set to a small value\n(Allen et al. 1995). But it is unclear how low that value\nshould be. Would .001 be sufficiently low or should it be .000001? All\nthat can be said, perhaps, is that in criminal cases the prior\nprobability of guilt should be extremely low (Friedman 2000).\n\nAlternatively, the prior probability can be equated to \\(1/n\\) where\n\\(n\\) is the number of total possible suspects or wrongdoers who could\nhave committed the crime or civil wrong under dispute at trial. This,\ntoo, is a plausible proposal. Since someone must have committed the\nwrong, absent any further evidence anyone could have committed it, so\n\\(1/n\\) is a reasonable starting point. But this proposal also quickly\nruns into difficulties. In some cases, whether a wrong was committed\nby anyone can itself be disputed. Or there might be cases in which an\nillegal act was certainly committed and the defendant took part in it,\nbut it is not clear what illegal act it was, say murder or\nmanslaughter.\n\nTo avoid some of the difficulties described above, other models\nrely on relevant background information, for example, geographical\ninformation about people\u2019s opportunities to commit crimes\n(Fenton et al. 2019). But even if these models are\nsuccessful in giving well-informed assessments of prior probabilities,\na deeper difficulty lingers. That is, any assessment of prior\nprobabilities, no matter how it is done, is likely to violate existing\nnormative requirements of the trial system (Dahlman 2017; Engel 2012;\nSchweizer 2013). If the assessment of prior probabilities relies on\ndemographic information, people who belong to certain demographic\ngroups will be regarded as having a higher prior probability of\ncommitting a wrong than others. But if some people\u2019s priors are\nhigher than other people\u2019s priors, it will be easier to convict\nor find liable those who are assigned higher priors, even if the\nevidence against them is the same as the evidence against those\nassigned lower priors. This outcome can be seen as unfair, especially\nin criminal cases, since it exposes to a higher risk of conviction\nthose innocents who are assigned a higher prior probability because of\nthe demographic group they belong to (Di Bello and O\u2019Neil\n2020).\n\nPerhaps, as some have suggested, legal probabilists should do away\nwith prior probabilities and rely on likelihood ratios instead as a\nguide for trial decisions (Sullivan 2019). Another strategy for\navoiding the problem of priors is to consider an interval of values\nand see the extent to which different possible priors affect the\nposterior probability (Finkelstein and Fairley 1970), as discussed\nin\n Section 1.4.\n7.4 The reference class problem\n\nAnother challenge to legal probabilism is the reference class problem.\nThe reference class problem, originally formulated by Venn (1866),\narises because the same event may belong to multiple reference classes\nin which the frequencies of the event in question are different. A\ncommon approach, given among others by Reichenbach (1935 [1949: 374]),\nis to rely on \u201cthe narrowest class for which reliable statistics\ncan be compiled\u201d. This may work in some cases provided reliable\nstatistics are available. But what if someone belongs to different\nclasses that are equally narrow?\n\nConsider the case of Charles Shonubi, a Nigerian citizen working in\nNew Jersey, who was arrested on 10 December 1991 at JFK Airport in New\nYork for smuggling heroin into the United States. He was found\ncarrying 103 balloons in his gastrintestinal tract containing 427.4\ngrams of heroin. During the sentencing proceedings, the prosecutor\nargued that since Shonubi made seven trips between the United States\nand Nigeria prior to his arrest, he smuggled a larger total quantity\nof heroin than 427.4 grams. The prosecution offered data on amounts of\nheroin seized from 117 Nigerian drug smugglers who were arrested at\nJFK airport between 1 September 1990 and 10 December 1991. The expert\nfor the prosecutor, Dr. Boyum, calculated that it was 99% likely that\nShonubi smuggled at least 2090.2 grams in total before his final trip\n(U.S. v. Shonubi 895 F. Supp 460, E.D.N.Y.\n1995).\n\nShonubi was a member of the reference class \u201cpeople found\ncarrying heroin while traveling between Nigeria and New York\u201d\nbut also the class \u201ctoll collectors at the George Washington\nbridge\u201d. Why rely on the former and not the latter to make\ninferences about how much heroin Shonubi smuggled into the United\nStates? (Colyvan, Regan, and Ferson 2001). What follows examines the specific\ndifficulties that the reference class problem poses for legal\nprobabilism and how legal probabilists might respond.\n7.4.1 The challenge\n\nAllen and Pardo (2007) argue that the reference class problem poses\na challenge for legal probabilism and more specifically for\nprobabilistic measures of evidentiary strength such as likelihood\nratios (see earlier in\n Section 2).\n The problem is that the same piece of evidence may be assigned\ndifferent likelihood ratios depending on the reference class chosen.\nFor example, the denominator in the likelihood ratio associated with a\nDNA match is the probability of a match given that a random person,\nunrelated to the crime, is the source. This probability depends on the\nfrequency of the profile in a select population. But which reference\npopulation should one choose? Since nothing in the natural world picks\nout one reference class over another\u2014the argument goes\u2014the\nlikelihood ratio would be an arbitrary measure of evidentiary\nstrength.\n\nIt is tempting to dismiss this challenge by noting that expert\nwitnesses work with multiple reference classes and entertain plausible\nranges of values (Nance 2007). In fact, relying on multiple reference\nclasses is customary in the assessment of DNA evidence. In Darling\nv. State, 808 So. 2d 145 (Fla. 2002),\nfor example, a Polish woman living in Orlando was sexually assaulted\nand killed. The DNA expert testified about multiple random match\nprobabilities, relying on frequencies about African-Americans,\nCaucasians and Southeastern Hispanics from the Miami area. Since the\nperpetrator could have belonged to any of these ethnic groups, the\ngroups considered by the expert were all relevant under different\nscenarios of what could have happened.\n\nUnlike expert witnesses, appellate courts often prefer that only one\nreference class be considered. In another case, Michael Pizarro, who\nmatched the crime traces, was convicted of raping and suffocating his\n13-year-old-half-sister (People v. Pizarro, 110\nCal.App.4th 530, 2003). The FBI analyst testified at trial that\nthe likelihood of finding another unrelated Hispanic individual with\nthe same genetic profile was approximately \\(\\slashfrac{1}{250,000}\\).\nSince the race of the perpetrator was not known, Pizarro appealed\narguing that the DNA evidence was inadmissible. The appellate court\nsided with Pizarro and objected to the presentation of frequency\nestimates for the Hispanic population as well as frequencies for any\nother racial or ethnic groups. The court wrote: \n\n\nIt does not matter how many Hispanics, Caucasians, Blacks, or Native\nAmericans resemble the perpetrator if the perpetrator is actually\nAsian.\n\n\nThe uneasiness that appellate courts display when expert witnesses\ntestify about multiple references classes is understandable. Perhaps,\nthe reference class most favorable to the defendant should be\nselected, giving the accused the benefit of the doubt. This might be\nappropriate in some cases. But suppose the random match probability\nassociated with a DNA match is 1 in 10 for people in group A, while it\nis 1 in 100 million for people in group B. Always going for the\nreference class that is most favorable to the defendant will in some\ncases weaken the incriminating force of DNA matches more than\nnecessary.\n7.4.2 Relevance and critical questions\n\nLegal probabilists have formulated different criteria for identifying\nthe most appropriate reference class. Franklin (2011) is optimistic.\nOn his approach, the most appropriate reference class for drawing an\ninference about an event or outcome \\(B\\) is the class defined by the\nintersection of all the features that are relevant to \\(B\\). Relevance\nis measured statistically given the available data as the co-variation\nof \\(B\\) with the feature in question. Co-variation will be measured\nusing appropriate statistical criteria, such as the correlation\ncoefficient between two variables. For instance, in the Shonubi case,\nfeatures such as being Nigerian, drug courier, traveling toward JFK,\nwere all relevant for making an inference about the total amount of\ndrugs Shonubi carried. Other features for which data were available,\nsuch as being a toll collector at the George Washington Bridge, were\nnot relevant. The optimism of Franklin\u2019s approach, however, is\ndimmed by the pervasiveness of the reference class problem (for more\ndetails, see H\u00e1jek 2007).\n\nInstead of focusing on relevance only, the choice of the most\nappropriate reference class may also include a mix of statistical (or\nepistemic) criteria as well as non-epistemic criteria. Dahlman (2018)\nproposes a list of critical questions, such as: Is the reference class\nheterogeneous or homogeneous? Is it robust? Does it put people in the\nreference class at an unfair disadvantage? The first two questions are\nepistemic, but the third is not. If people in certain ethnic or\nsocio-economic groups engage in criminal acts more often than others,\nrelying on ethnic or socio-economic reference classes may heighten\nsociety\u2019s stigma and prejudice toward members of these groups.\nRelying on these reference classes should therefore be avoided, not\nbecause they are irrelevant but because they are prejudicial.\n7.4.3 Model selection\n\nThe reference class problem can be thought of as a particular case of \nthe model selection problem (Cheng 2009).  The model should capture the data to some extent, but not overfit the data. Random variation in the data should not be built\ninto the model. In statistics, different criteria for model selection\nexists, most notably the Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC),\nwhich is a popular measure of the trade-off between model\u2019s fit\nwith the data and its complexity. Consider the Shonubi case again. In\norder to predict the total amount of heroin Shonubi transported, a\nsimple linear model could be used, where each reference class\ncomes with an empirically established\nmultiplier \\(\\beta\\) for the expected total amount of drugs carried\nbased on how much drugs one carried on a single trip. Picking too\ngeneric a class (say, \u201cairline passenger\u201d) would lower the\nempirical adequacy of the model, but relying on too narrow a class\nwould incorporate random noise. A model using the class \u201ctoll\ncollector\u201d would clearly perform\n(in terms of statistical measures such as AIC) worse than, say a model\nbased on the class \u201cNigerian drug\ncourier at JFK\u201d.\n\nColyvan and Regan (2007) argue that the reference class problem is a\nform of model uncertainty. For them, the reference class problem stems from uncertainty about the particular statistical model that should be employed. Model\nuncertainty is evident in the Shonubi case as alternative models were\ndiscussed. The first model consisted in multiplying the amount which\nShonubi was found carrying when he was arrested by the number of trips\nhe made between the Nigeria and New York. Admittedly, this model was\ntoo simplistic. The expert witness for the prosecution, Dr. Boyum,\ndeveloped a second model. It was based on the DEA data and consisted\nin the simulation of 100,000 possible series of seven trips by\nre-sampling sets of seven net weights from the 117 known cases.\n\nBoyum\u2019s model was criticized by another expert in the case, Dr.\nFinkelstein, who complained that the model did not take into\nconsideration systematic differences between trips. Presumably,\nsmugglers will tend to carry larger quantities as they become more\nexperienced. When they carry larger quantities, it should be more\nlikely they would be apprehended. If the trip effect holds, the data\nwould mostly be about advanced smugglers who tend to carry more than\nbeginners. No empirical evidence for or against the trip effect theory\ncould be found. Information on the number of previous trips was\nmissing from the data so an appropriate regression model for the trip\neffect could not be developed. On other other hand, Judge Weinstein\nargued that beginner smugglers do practice swallowing with grapes, and\nthus the learning curve should not be excessively steep. In addition,\nbeginners are more likely to be apprehended than advanced smugglers.\nIf so, the data would not be biased by the trip effect. Interestingly,\ninformation on Nigerian drug smuggling practices undermines the trip\neffect theory: the drug cartel did not waste money on sending\nhalf-filled drug mules, but rather made them practice swallowing\nballoons weeks prior to their first trip (Treaser 1992; Wren\n1999).\n\nStatistical analyses of the evidence in Shonubi were published after\nthe case was decided. These analyses took into account other potential\nsources of error, such as outliers and biased data. Gastwirth,\nFreidlin, and Miao (2000) showed that, because of sensitivity to\noutliers, the inference that the total amount was above 3000 grams was\nunstable. However, even looking at the data in the light most\nfavorable to the defendant, the total amount of drugs should be above\nthe 1000 gram threshold (Gastwirth,\nFreidlin, and Miao 2000; Izenman 2000a,b).\n\nBesides Shonubi, many other cases raise the reference class or model\nselection in their own way. Just to list a few:\n\n\n\nVuyanich v.\u2006Republic National Bank involved race and\nsex discrimination allegation. The case involved nine different expert\nwitnesses deploying various statistical analyses. The case ended with\na 127-page opinion.\n\n\nE.E.O.C. v.\u2006Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was a\nsimilar case, where the appropriateness of various methods for group\ncomparisons and the choice of level of aggregation for the analysis of\nemployment data was at play.\n\n\nGulf South Insulation v.\u2006U.S. Consumer Product Safety\nCommission was related to banning the use of urea-formaldehyde\nfoam insulation. The difficulty lied in the choice of a risk\nassessment model to calculate the risk of increased incidence of\ncancer.\n\n\nThese cases are interesting as well as complicated. They are discussed\nin some detail in Fienberg (1989).",
