    "main_text": "Category Differences || The Uses of Category Distinctions\n2.1 The Uses of Category Distinctions\n\nThose who focus on articulating category distinctions rather than on\nlaying out complete systems of categories generally invoke categories\nnot in hopes of providing answers to such basic metaphysical questions\nas \u2018what exists\u2019, but rather as a way of exposing,\navoiding, or dissolving various presumed philosophical mistakes,\nconfusions, and paradoxes.\n\nThus, e.g., Russell and Whitehead introduced type theory (which might\nin some sense be considered a theory of categories) to avoid a certain\nform of paradox found in Fregean set theory (where we must consider\nthe putative set of all non-self membered sets, which is a member of\nitself if and only if it is not a member of itself), liar\u2019s\nparadoxes (\u201cThis sentence is false\u201d, which is true if and\nonly if it is false), etc. On their analysis, paradoxes like these\narise from the attempt to form an illegitimate totality by trying to\ncollect into a single totality a collection that has members that\npresuppose the existence of the totality. To avoid such paradoxes, we\nmust accept that \u201cWhatever involves all of a collection\nmust not be one of the collection\u201d (1913 [1962], 37) and thus\nthat such totalities (involving all of a collection) must be of a\nhigher type, making, e.g., classes of sets of a higher type than are\nsets of individuals, and so on, leading to an infinite hierarchy of\ntypes. The type-mixing paradox-generating claims are rejected as\nill-formed and meaningless (1913 [1962]).\n\nMost famously, Ryle (1949) introduced the idea of the category mistake\nas a way of dispelling the confusions he thought to be rampant in the\nCartesian theory of the mind, and thus of dissolving many apparent\nproblems in philosophy of mind. According to Ryle, one makes a\ncategory mistake when one mistakes the logical type or category of a\ncertain expression (1949, 16\u201317). Thus, e.g., a foreigner would\nmake a category mistake if he observed the various colleges,\nlibraries, and administrative offices of Oxford, and then asked to be\nshown the university. The foreigner mistakes the university for\nanother institution like those he has seen, when in fact it is\nsomething of another category altogether: \u201cthe way in which all\nthat he has already seen is organized\u201d (1949, 16). The category\nmistake behind the Cartesian theory of mind, on Ryle\u2019s view, is\nbased in representing mental concepts such as believing, knowing,\naspiring, or detesting as acts or processes (and concluding they must\nbe covert, unobservable acts or processes), when the concepts of\nbelieving, knowing, and the like are actually dispositional (1949,\n33). Properly noting category distinctions may help alleviate a\nvariety of philosophical problems and perplexities, and the idea of\nthe category mistake was widely wielded (by Ryle and others) with this\naim. Ofra Magidor suggests that it is \u201cfar from clear what Ryle\ntook the central mistake in the dualistic position to be\u201d (2013,\n10). Jonah Goldwater (forthcoming), however, argues that, in The\nConcept of Mind, the category mistakes Ryle identifies all have\nthe form of mistakenly conjoining entities that belong in two\ndifferent categories \u2013 implicitly assigning their conjuncts to a\nshared category. But on Ryle\u2019s view (Goldwater argues) there is\noften no single highest category (\u2018existent\u2019) under which\nwe can subsume the conjoined entities, and so we cannot sensibly\nconjoin, count, or quantify over them together. This, Goldwater\nargues, not only clarifies the basis for Ryle\u2019s critique of both\nCartesian and physicalist theories of mind, but also has the potential\nto dissolve various current debates in metaphysics, such as arguments\nagainst co-location that are based on denying (for example) that there\nis a statue and a lump both on the pedestal. Huw\nPrice (2009, 330\u2013335) argues that the category differences Ryle\nidentifies can be seen as underlain by functional differences\nin the sorts of language used. The thought that category mistakes are\nsymptoms of underlying functional differences, as Price puts it,\nsuggests that to evaluate claims of category mistakes, and their\nrelevance to traditional \u2018metaphysical\u2019 problems, we need\n\u201cfirst-order scientific inquiries into the underlying functions\nof language in human life\u201d (Price 2009, 335). Thomasson (2022,\n23\u201329) picks up this idea, and begins to suggest how work in\nsystemic functional linguistics can provide a way of understanding\ndifferences in linguistic function that may underlie a range of\nphilosophical problems.\n\nWork on category distinctions also has other applications in assessing\ntraditional debates in metaphysics. Thomasson (2007) argues that\nvarious mistakes and puzzlements in ontology can be traced to the\nmistaken use of category-neutral existential and quantificational\nclaims. A great many arguments in ontology rely on claims about\nwhether, in various situations, there is some object present\n(or how many objects there are), where the term \u2018object\u2019\nmust be used in a category-neutral way for the argument to go through\n(Thomasson 2007, 112\u2013118). But if existential and\nquantificational claims must tacitly presuppose some category or\ncategories of entity over which we are quantifying, then such\narguments go astray. Thomasson (2007) gives independent grounds for\nthinking that all quantification must at least tacitly presuppose a\ncategory or categories of entity over which we are quantifying, and\nargues that adopting that view provides the uniform basis for\ndissolving a number of problems supposed to arise with accepting an\nontology of ordinary objects. Jonah Goldwater (2021) argues that the\narguments standardly given for being eliminativist about a certain\nkind of entity all rely on mistaken principles or judgments about\nontological categories, to which the right response is typically to\nrectify these mistakes about categories, not to eliminate the\nentities. This analysis, Goldwater argues, provides a kind of indirect\nsupport for \u2018permissivist\u2019 ontologies, that would accept\nthe existence of numbers, properties, holes, or other entities to\nwhich metaphysicians have often sought to avoid commitment.\n\nWork on category distinctions is also relevant to debates in\nlinguistics and philosophy of language about what, exactly, a category\nmistake is, and why category mistakes are infelicitous. Analyzing\ncategory mistakes and why they are infelicitous (as Magidor 2019 makes\nclear) has further relevance for linguistic theories of syntax,\nsemantics, pragmatics, and of metaphorical and fictional discourse.\nMagidor (2013, 2019) surveys past answers to the question of what\nmakes a category mistake infelicitous, including: that they are\nsyntactically ill-formed, that they are meaningless, that they are\nmeaningful but lacking in truth-value, and that they are (despite\nbeing well formed, meaningful and having truth-value) pragmatically\ninappropriate. Magidor argues against the first three options, and\ndefends instead a presuppositional account of why sentences that seem\nto contain category mistakes are infelicitous. Roughly, on her view, a\nsentence like \u2018Two is green\u2019 triggers the presupposition\nthat two is colored \u2013 a presupposition that is difficult to\naccommodate (2013, 132). Thus, on her analysis, the sentence is\ninfelicitous, but still has a truth-value (it is false).\n",
