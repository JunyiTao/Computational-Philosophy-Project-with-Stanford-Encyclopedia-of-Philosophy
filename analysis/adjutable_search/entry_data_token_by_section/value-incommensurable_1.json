    "main_text": "Value Incommensurability || Measurement and Comparison\n1.1 Measurement and Comparison \n\nThe term \u201cincommensurable\u201d suggests the lack of a common\nmeasure. This idea has its historical roots in mathematics. For the\nancient Greeks, who had not recognized irrational numbers, the\ndimensions of certain mathematical objects were found to lack a common\nunit of measurement. Consider the side and the diagonal of a unit\nsquare. These can be compared or ranked ordinally, since the diagonal\nis longer. However, without the use of irrational numbers, there is no\nway to specify with cardinal numbers exactly how much longer the\ndiagonal is than the side of a unit square. The significance of this\nkind of incommensurability, especially for the Pythagoreans, is a\nmatter of some debate (Burkert 1972, 455\u2013465). Hippasus of Metapontum,\nwho was thought by many to have demonstrated this kind of\nincommensurability, is held by legend to have been drowned by the gods\nfor revealing his discovery (Heath 1921, 154; von Fritz 1970,\n407).\n\nGiven these historical roots, some authors reserve the term\n\u201cincommensurable\u201d for comparisons that can be made, but\nnot cardinally (Stocker 1980, 176; Stocker 1997, 203; Chang 1997b, 2).\nOthers interpret the idea of a common measure more broadly. On this\nbroader interpretation, for there to be a common measure, all that is\nrequired is that ordinal comparisons or rankings are possible. Values\nor bearers of value are then incommensurable only when not even an\nordinal comparison or ranking is possible (e.g., Raz 1986; Rabinowicz\n2021a). On this interpretation, incommensurability is defined as the\nrelation that holds between two items when neither is better than the\nother nor are they equally as good.\n\nOthers\nhave not given an exact\ndefinition of the term, but use it as an inclusive umbrella term for\ncomparability problems in general. This inclusive interpretation has\nthe advantage of encompassing a field of diverse philosophical\ndiscussions which engages in problems concerning value comparisons.\nThis entry encourages the use of \u201cincommensurable\u201d in the\netymologically correct way i.e., to refer to the lack of a cardinal\nscale.\n",
