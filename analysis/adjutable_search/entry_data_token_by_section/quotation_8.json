    "main_text": "Five Theories of Quotation || The Proper Name Theory\n3.1 The Proper Name Theory\n\nIt is now almost a tradition in the literature on quotation to include\na brief dismissive discussion of the Proper Name Theory of Quotation.\nThis view is described, although not clearly endorsed, in passages in\nQuine and Tarski (e.g., Quine 1940, pp. 23\u201326; 1961, p. 140;\nTarski 1933, p. 159ff), and comments in passing in both Reichenbach\n(1947, p. 335) and Carnap (1947, p. 4) strongly suggest they were\nadherents. That said, there is some debate about whether Quine and\nTarski ever held the view (see, e.g., Bennett 1988, Richard 1986, Saka\n1998, and Gomez-Torrente 2001). And so it is worth mentioning that\nalthough we quote\u00a0both Quine and Tarski below, we do not thereby\nmean to attribute the Proper Name Theory to either of them; we do so\nmerely because they describe it clearly.\n\nUntil recently, it was generally held that the name theory was\n\u2018an utter failure\u2019 (Saka 1998, p. 114), of interest only\nas showing us how not to theorize about quotation. In recent years,\nhowever, there have been at least two defenses of something like the\nname theory (Gomez-Torrente 2013 and Johnson 2018). We here present\nthe reasons the name theory was long taken to be a non-starter, as\nwell as the responses to these problems by the authors mentioned\nabove.\n\nAccording to the Proper Name Theory, quotations are unstructured\nproper names of the quoted expressions. Quine writes:\n\nFrom the standpoint of logical analysis each whole quotation must be\nregarded as a single word or sign, whose parts count for no more than\nserifs or syllables. (Quine 1940, p. 26)\n\n\nThe personal name buried within the first word of the statement\n\u2018\u2018Cicero\u2019 has six letters\u2019, e.g., is logically\nno more germane to the statement than is the verb \u2018let\u2019\nwhich is buried within the last word. (Quine 1940, p. 26)\n\n\nTarski formulates the view as follows:\n\nQuotation-mark names may be treated like single words of a language,\nand thus like syntactically simple expressions. The single\nconstituents of these names\u2014the quotation marks and the\nexpressions standing between them\u2014fulfill the same function as\nthe letters and complexes of successive letters in single words. Hence\nthey can possess no independent meaning. Every quotation-mark name is\nthen a constant individual name of a definite expression (the\nexpression enclosed by the quotation marks) and is in fact a name of\nthe same nature as the proper name of a man. (Tarski 1933, p. 159)\n\n3.1.1 Strengths of the Proper Name Theory\n\nThe Proper Name Theory nicely accommodates (BQ1)\u2013(BQ3); that is,\non this theory we see why co-referential expressions cannot be\nsubstituted for one another. According to the Proper Name Theory, the\nname \u2018Cicero\u2019 does not occur in\n\u2018\u2018Cicero\u2019\u2019; from the mere fact that Cicero =\nTully, it does not follow that \u2018Tully\u2019 can be substituted\nfor \u2018Cicero\u2019 in \u2018\u2018Cicero\u2019\u2019. As\nQuine puts it, \u2018[t]o make substitution upon a personal name,\nwith such a context, would be no more justifiable than to make a\nsubstitution upon the term \u2018cat\u2019 within the context\n\u2018cattle\u2019 (Quine 1961, p. 141). The Proper Name Theory\npermits the creation of new quotations much as natural languages\npermit the introduction of new names. And it prohibits quantifying in,\nsince each quotation is a single word, and so there is nothing to\nquantify into. To see this, consider the following. We obviously can\u2019t\nquantify into words. The idea barely makes sense. Imagine we have the\nsentence \u2018there is a birth dearth in Europe\u2019. We can\u2019t\nquantify into, say, the word \u2018dearth\u2019. The following\ndoesn\u2019t make sense, where we\u2019re trying to express\u00a0an existential\ngeneralization satisfied by the word or string\n\u2018earth\u2019:\n\n(14)\n\\((\\exists x)\\) (there is a birth \\(dx\\) in Europe) \n\n\nThis is nonsense: \u2018dx\u2019 just can\u2019t mean \u2018d\u2019\ncombined with the value of the variable \u2018x\u2019. Now\nconsider:\n\n(15)\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 has eight letters.\n(16)\n\\((\\exists x)\\)(\u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 has eight letters)\n\n\n\nThis is also ill-formed. The proper name theorist can explain it.\nRemember, for the proper name theorist, quotations are akin to names\nand quotation marks are akin to letters. But then if that\u2019s so, (16)\nis on a par with (14): both are trying to quantify into expressions\n(the former expressions beginning with \u2018d\u2019\u00a0and the\nlatter expressions beginning with \u2018\u00a0and ending with\n\u2018). The obvious badness of (14) can explain the badness of (16),\nfor the proper name theorist.\n3.1.2 Weaknesses of the Proper Name Theory\n\nHere are three objections to the Proper Name Theory of Quotation. (The\nmain objections are in Davidson (1979, pp. 81\u201383), though some\nwere anticipated by Geach (1957, p.79ff).)\n\nObjection 1: The Proper Name Theory cannot\nexplain how we can generate and interpret an indefinite number of\nnovel quotations (see BQ5).\n\nIf quotations were proper names and lacked semantic structure\naltogether, then there would be no rule for determining how to\ngenerate or interpret novel quotations. To understand one would be to\nlearn a new name. (Remember, the quotation marks, according to Quine,\ncarry no more significance than the serifs you see on these letters.)\nBut (11), e.g., can be understood by someone who has never encountered\nits quoted symbol before.\n\n(11)\n\u2018\u2766\u2019 is not a letter in any language\n\n\nUnderstanding (11) is not like understanding a sentence with a\npreviously unknown proper name. Upon encountering (11), it would seem\nthat you know exactly which symbol is being referenced in a way that\nyou do not with a name you\u2019ve never before encountered.\n\nFor a long time, this objection was thought fatal. However, a paper by\nMario Gomez-Torrente (2013) suggests a way to square something like\nthe name view with Objection 1. In brief, he points\nout that there are some names that can be indefinitely generated and\ninterpreted. For example, street names. \u2018East 6th Street\u2019,\npresumably, is a bona fide name, but one doesn\u2019t either need to\nindividually bestow it on the particular street it applies to (the\nstreet between East 5th and East 7th), nor does one need to have\nalready learned it to understand what \u2018East 6th Street has some\ngreat bars\u2019 means.\n\nObjection 2: There\u2019s a special relationship\nbetween quotations and their semantic values (see BQ4).\n\nAccording to the Proper Name Theory, the relationship between\n\u201clobsters\u201d and \u2018lobsters\u2019 is no closer than\nthe relationship between \u2018lobsters\u2019 and lobsters. That\nseems to miss the fundamental aspect of quotation spelled out in\n(BQ4).\n\nDavidson summarizes these first two objections succinctly:\n\nIf quotations are structureless singular terms, then there is no more\nsignificance to the category of quotation-mark names than to\nthe category of names that begin and end with the letter\n\u2018a\u2019 (\u2018Atlanta\u2019, \u2018Alabama\u2019,\n\u2018Alta\u2019, \u2018Athena\u2019, etc.). On this view, there\nis no relation, beyond an accident of spelling, between an expression\nand the quotation-mark name of that expression. (Davidson 1979, pp.\n81\u201382; cf., also, Garcia-Carpintero 1994, pp. 254\u201355)\n\n\nAgain, however, some work has pushed back against these old\nobjections. Michael Johnson (2018) points to some names which bear\nspecial relationships to their referents. In particular, he points to\nonomatopoeia. For example, \u2018buzz\u2019 refers to a\nsound, a buzzing sound. But the word \u2018buzz\u2019, when uttered,\nmakes the sound it refers to. Roughly speaking, Johnson holds that we\ncould view quotations in the same way: as he says, \u2018the name of\na person sounds like the name of his name\u2019 (2018). For some\ndiscussion of Johnson\u2019s view, see Miller 2019.\n\nObjection 3: Proper Name Theory leaves no room\nfor dual use and mention (see BQ6).\n\nIf quotations were proper names, and if their interiors lacked\nsignificant structure, there would seem to be no room for dual usage\nof the kind found in (12); indeed, on the Proper Name Theory, (12) has\nthe same interpretive form as (17):\n\n(12)\nQuine said that quotation \u2018has a certain anomalous\nfeature\u2019.\n(17)\nQuine said that quotation Ted.\n\n\nThat is, the Proper Name Theory fails to account for (BQ6).\n\nOther objections have been raised against the Proper Name Theory of\nQuotation. For further discussion, see Davidson (1979), Cappelen and\nLepore (1997b) and Saka (1998). Whether the recent defenders of the\nname theory will be able to take it off its deathbed remains to be\nseen, but it\u2019s fair to say that their work shows that reports of\nits demise have been, at least, a bit premature.\n",
