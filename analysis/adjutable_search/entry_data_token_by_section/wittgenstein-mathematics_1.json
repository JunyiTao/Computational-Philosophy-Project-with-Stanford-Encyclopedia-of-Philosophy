    "main_text": "The Middle Wittgenstein\u2019s Finitistic Constructivism\n2. The Middle Wittgenstein\u2019s Finitistic Constructivism\n\nThere is little doubt that Wittgenstein was invigorated by L.E.J.\nBrouwer\u2019s March 10, 1928 Vienna lecture \u201cScience,\nMathematics, and Language\u201d (Brouwer 1929), which he attended\nwith F. Waismann and H. Feigl, but it is a gross overstatement to say\nthat he returned to Philosophy because of this lecture or that his\nintermediate interest in the Philosophy of Mathematics issued\nprimarily from Brouwer\u2019s influence. In fact,\nWittgenstein\u2019s return to Philosophy and his intermediate work on\nmathematics is also due to conversations with Ramsey and members of\nthe Vienna Circle, to Wittgenstein\u2019s disagreement with Ramsey\nover identity, and several other factors.\n\nThough Wittgenstein seems not to have read any Hilbert or Brouwer\nprior to the completion of the Tractatus, by early 1929\nWittgenstein had certainly read work by Brouwer, Weyl, Skolem, Ramsey\n(and possibly Hilbert) and, apparently, he had had one or more private\ndiscussions with Brouwer in 1928 (Finch 1977: 260; Van Dalen 2005:\n566\u2013567). Thus, the rudimentary treatment of mathematics in the\nTractatus, whose principal influences were Russell and Frege,\nwas succeeded by detailed work on mathematics in the middle period\n(1929\u20131933), which was strongly influenced by the 1920s work of\nBrouwer, Weyl, Hilbert, and Skolem.\n",
