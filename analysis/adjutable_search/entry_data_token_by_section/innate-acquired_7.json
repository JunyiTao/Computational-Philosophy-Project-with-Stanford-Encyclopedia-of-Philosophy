    "main_text": "Philosophical diagnoses of the scientific debates\n2. Philosophical diagnoses of the scientific debates\n\nThe previous section reviewed some of the arguments raised by\nscientists about the nature of instinct or innateness and the\nquestionable scientific utility of this concept. In this section, we\nconsider some recent proposals by philosophers to capture what is at\nissue in these debates. These philosophical diagnoses vary\nconsiderably, not only in their understanding of what is at issue, but\nalso in their methods. As we will see, this is one of the topics on\nwhich an \u2018experimental philosophy\u2019 (X-phi) approach has\nbeen put to productive use (see\n SEP entry\n on this topic). What follows is a review of five different\nphilosophical hypotheses about what is at issue in scientific debates\nover nativism.\n",
