    "main_text": "Why Purely Holist Explanations Can Sometimes Stand on Their Own || The Argument from Explanatory Practices\n4.3 The Argument from Explanatory Practices\n\nThe argument from explanatory practices likewise targets the mechanism\nview of explanation that is taken to underwrite the claim that purely\nholist explanations must be complemented by accounts of the underlying\nindividual-level mechanisms. The argument has been presented by\nKincaid, who observes that both in everyday and scientific contexts,\nwe offer explanations that lack specifications of the underlying\nmechanisms while still regarding these explanations as being perfectly\nacceptable (Kincaid 1997: 28). For instance, that a flying ball hit\nthe window is typically regarded as a successful explanation as to why\nthe window broke, even though no account of the underlying mechanisms\nis offered. This shows that our standard explanatory practices\nconflict with the mechanism model of explanation and, on this ground,\nthe model should be dismissed. If this is so, there is no longer any\nreason for holding that purely holist explanations must always be\naccompanied by accounts of the underlying individual-level\nmicrofoundations.\n\nThe argument from explanatory practices and the earlier argument from\nmechanism regress intend to reject the mechanism model of explanation,\nso that it cannot serve as justification for the claim that purely\nholist explanations can never stand on their own. This makes it\nnatural to wonder whether the demand for accounts of individual-level\nmicrofoundations may be upheld without appeal to this model of\nexplanation. This issue has also been addressed in the debate.\n",
