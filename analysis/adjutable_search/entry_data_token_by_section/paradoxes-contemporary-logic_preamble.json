    "main_text": "\n\nBy \u201cparadox\u201d one usually means a statement claiming\nsomething which goes beyond (or even against) \u2018common\nopinion\u2019 (what is usually believed or held). Paradoxes form a\nnatural object of philosophical investigation ever since the origins\nof rational thought; they have been invented as part of complex\narguments and as tools for refuting philosophical theses (think of the\ncelebrated paradoxes credited to Zeno of Elea, concerning motion, the\ncontinuum, the opposition between unity and plurality, or of the\narguments entangling the notions of truth and vagueness, credited to\nthe Megarian School, and Eubulides of Miletus). Paradoxes\u2014termed\nas Insolubilia\u2014form also a substantial part of logical\nand philosophical investigations during the Middle Ages.\n\nThis entry concentrates on the emergence of non-trivial logical themes\nand notions from the discussion on paradoxes from the beginning of the\n20th century until 1945, and attempts to assess their importance for\nthe development of contemporary logic. Paradoxes involving\n vagueness,\n knowledge,\n belief,\n and\n space and time\n are treated in separate entries.\n\nA terminological warning is in order. The word \u201cantinomy\u201d\nis used below as alternative to, and synonymous with,\n\u201cparadox\u201d. Most paradoxes\u2014but not all\u2014involve\ncontradictions; for such cases, we often use the word\n\u201ccontradiction\u201d as well.\n",
