    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\n\nThe only major work that we possess of Judah Abrabanel is the\nDialoghi d\u2019amore. There is some debate as to when the\nwork was actually written. Many point to the year 1501\u20131502 owing to a\nphrase in the third book: \u201cAccording to the Jewish tradition, we\nare in the year 5262 from the beginning of creation\u201d (Siamo,\nsecondo la verit\u00e1 ebraica, a cinque milia ducento sessanta due\ndel principio de la\n creazione).[7] \n The year 5262 of the Jewish calendar corresponds to 1501\u20131502 of the\nGregorian calendar. Yet, manuscripts other than that based on the 1535\nedition have the date of 5272 (i.e., 1511\u20131512). This is significant\nbecause many who argue that the Dialoghi could not possibly\nhave been written in Italian point to the fact that Judah would not\nhave been fluent in Italian. Yet, if we assume the 1511\u20131512 date to\nbe correct this would place him in Italy for close to twenty years,\nmore than enough time to gain proficiency in Italian (especially given\nthe fact that he would have already known at least one Spanish\nvernacular and, as a physician, Latin).\n\n\nWe also know that Judah wrote poetry (see the poem quoted above). In\naddition to his biographical poem, he also composed poetic\nintroductions to three of his father\u2019s last works: Rosh\nAmanah, Zevach Pesach, and Nachalat Avot.\n\n\nFinally, we possess a letter dating to 1566 from one Amatus Lusitanus,\na physician who wrote that he attended to a patient by the name of\nJudah \u201cwho was the grandson of the great Platonic philosopher,\nknown as Judah or Leon Abrabanel, who gave to us the most beautiful\ndialogues on love.\u201d Further in this letter, he mentions that\nJudah also composed a work entitled De Coeli Harmonia\n(\u201cOn the Harmony of the Spheres\u201d) and that, according to\nthe introduction, he dedicated it to the \u201cdivine Pico della\nMirandola.\u201d Unfortunately, this work has not survived. If he\ndedicated to Pico as the letter indicates, it would most likely have\nbeen composed before the Dialoghi and also, based on the\ntitle, it would have been composed in Latin.\n",
