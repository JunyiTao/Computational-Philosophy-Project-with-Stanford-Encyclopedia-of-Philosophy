    "main_text": "Recent Work in Analytic Philosophical Theology || Trinity\n2.1 Trinity\n\nAnalytic philosophical theology on the Trinity has focused primarily\non the \u201clogical\u201d problem of the Trinity, the problem of\nhow the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\u2014construed as three\nreally existing, really distinct divine entities\u2014can also be\nexactly one God (Cartwright 1987). The Church\u2019s first two\necumenical councils defined the orthodox terminology now used to state\nthe doctrine, but the councils did not attempt a philosophical\nsolution to the logical problem. In the traditional terminology, the\nFather, Son, and Spirit are three distinct divine persons\n(personae in Latin; hypostases in Greek) who share a\nsingle divine nature (substantia in Latin;\nousia in Greek; see Tanner 1990: 5, 24, 28). The logical\nproblem then becomes the problem of how three divine persons (whatever\nwe mean by \u201cpersons\u201d) can instantiate a single divine\nnature (whatever we mean by \u201cnature\u201d) while remaining\nnumerically distinct.\n\nResponses to the logical problem can be grouped into several families,\neach with its own advantages and disadvantages. \u201cSocial\u201d\ntrinitarians defend an account of the Trinity on which the Father,\nSon, and Spirit are three distinct centers of consciousness, with\nthree distinct centers of knowledge, will, and action, who\nnevertheless count as a single God. Social trinitarians attempt to\nsecure the divine unity by arguing that a single divine nature can\nsupport three separate consciousnesses. They may also claim that the\nthree persons necessarily love each other so perfectly and act in such\nharmony that they are properly regarded as a single God. Prominent\nsocial trinitarians include Richard Swinburne (1994), William Lane\nCraig (2006), Keith Yandell (2009), and William Hasker (2013).\n\nBy contrast, \u201cLatin\u201d trinitarians deny that the Father,\nSon, and Spirit are distinct centers of consciousness. On Latin\ntrinitarianism, even though the Father, Son, and Spirit are\nnumerically distinct persons, they are not numerically\ndistinct divine agents. When they act, they do not merely act\nin perfect harmony (as on social trinitarianism). Rather they are\n(somehow) a single actor, with a single will, carrying out a single\naction. The special challenge for Latin trinitarianism is to explain\nhow it can be the case that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, so\nconstrued, really do exist as concrete, distinct entities, and are not\njust different names for the same entity, or different phases in the\nlife of a not-essentially triune God. Brian Leftow offers the most\nwell-developed Latin model, which appeals to an extended analogy to a\ntime-travelling chorus-line dancer (2004).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the sharpest critics of Latin trinitarianism are those\nwho advocate a social trinity, and vice-versa: each side insists that\nthe theoretical costs of the opposing view are too great. So Latin\ntrinitarians charge that social trinitarians do not escape tri-theism\n(Leftow 1999; see also Merricks 2006); social trinitarians argue that\ntheir Latin counterparts cannot explain how the Father and Son could\nhave a genuine, \u201cI\u2013you\u201d, personal relationship, as\nthe Biblical account seems to suggest (e.g., Matt 3:17, Mark 14:36;\nHasker 2013: 114\u2013118; McCall 2010: 87\u201388).\n\nPhilosophical responses to the logical problem of the Trinity do not\ndivide exhaustively into social models and Latin models.\n\u201cRelative identity\u201d theorists argue that identity is\nkind-relative, so the Father can be the same God as the Son\nwithout being the same person as the son (van Inwagen 1995).\n\u201cConstitution\u201d theorists make a similar claim by drawing\non the metaphysics of constitution. According to constitution\ntheorists, a lump of bronze can constitute a statue without\nbeing identical to it, since we can destroy the statue (by melting it\ndown) without destroying the bronze. So too, they argue, the divine\nnature can constitute the three divine persons without being identical\nto them, or without entailing that they are identical to each other\n(Brower & Rea 2005). The metaphysics of constitution requires a\ncoherent notion of \u201cnumerical sameness without identity\u201d.\nThe sharpest criticism of relative identity accounts of the Trinity\ntakes aim at the underlying notion that identity is kind-relative in\nthe relevant sense. Similarly, the sharpest criticism of constitution\nviews expresses doubts about the cogency and usefulness of the\nmetaphysics of constitution (Merricks 2006).\n\nScott Williams defends a hybrid \u201cLatin social\u201d model of\nthe Trinity on which the Father, Son, and Spirit are each constituted\nby the single divine nature, without being numerically identical to\nthe divine nature or to any other person (2013, 2017). Unlike other\nLatin models, on Williams\u2019s account each of the persons is a\ndistinct agent; unlike other social models, they share numerically one\nset of powers, including one will (2017). Even so, according to\nWilliams, the persons can each token the indexical \u201cI\u201d\nwith different senses. Critics argue that Williams\u2019s model\nfalters at precisely this point (Hasker 2018b; see also S. Williams\n2020).\n\nFor an extended discussion, see the entry,\n Trinity.\n",
