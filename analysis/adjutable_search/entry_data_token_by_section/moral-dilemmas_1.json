    "main_text": "The Concept of Moral Dilemmas\n2. The Concept of Moral Dilemmas\n\nWhat is common to the two well-known cases is conflict. In each case,\nan agent regards herself as having moral reasons to do each of two\nactions, but doing both actions is not possible. Ethicists have called\nsituations like these moral dilemmas. The crucial features of\na moral dilemma are these: the agent is required to do each of two (or\nmore) actions; the agent can do each of the actions; but the agent\ncannot do both (or all) of the actions. The agent thus seems condemned\nto moral failure; no matter what she does, she will do something wrong\n(or fail to do something that she ought to do).\n\nThe Platonic case strikes many as too easy to be characterized as a\ngenuine moral dilemma. For the agent\u2019s solution in that case is\nclear; it is more important to protect people from harm than to return\na borrowed weapon. And in any case, the borrowed item can be returned\nlater, when the owner no longer poses a threat to others. Thus in this\ncase we can say that the requirement to protect others from serious\nharm overrides the requirement to repay one\u2019s debts by\nreturning a borrowed item when its owner so demands. When one of the\nconflicting requirements overrides the other, we have a conflict but\nnot a genuine moral dilemma. So in addition to the features mentioned\nabove, in order to have a genuine moral dilemma it must also\nbe true that neither of the conflicting requirements is overridden\n(Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, Chapter 1).\n",
