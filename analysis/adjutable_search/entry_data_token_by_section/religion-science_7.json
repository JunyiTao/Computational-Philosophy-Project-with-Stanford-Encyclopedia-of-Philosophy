    "main_text": "Science and religion in various religions || Hinduism\n2.3 Hinduism\n\nHinduism is the world\u2019s third largest religion, though the term\n\u201cHinduism\u201d is an awkward catch-all phrase that denotes\ndiverse religious and philosophical traditions that emerged on the\nIndian subcontinent between 500 BCE and 300 CE. The vast majority of\nHindus live in India; most others live in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and\nSoutheast Asia, with a significant diaspora in western countries such\nas the United States (Hackett 2015\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n In contrast to the Abrahamic monotheistic religions, Hinduism does not\nalways draw a sharp distinction between God and creation. (While there\nare pantheistic and panentheistic views in Christianity, Judaism, and\nIslam, these are minority positions.) Many Hindus believe in a\npersonal God, and identify this God as immanent in creation. This view\nhas ramifications for the science and religion debate, in that there\nis no sharp ontological distinction between creator and creature\n(Subbarayappa 2011). Religious traditions originating on the Indian\nsubcontinent, including Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism, are\nreferred to as dharmic religions. Philosophical points of view are\nreferred to as dar\u015bana. \n\nOne factor that unites the different strands of Hinduism is the\nimportance of foundational texts composed between ca. 1600 and 700\nBCE. These include the Vedas, which contain hymns and prescriptions\nfor performing rituals, Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, accompanying liturgical\ntexts, and Upani\u1e63ad, metaphysical treatises. The Vedas discuss\ngods who personify and embody natural phenomena such as fire (Agni)\nand wind (V\u0101yu). More gods appear in the following centuries\n(e.g., Ga\u1e47e\u015ba and Sati-Parvati in the 4th century). Note\nthat there are both polytheistic and monotheistic strands in Hinduism,\nso it is not the case that individual believers worship or recognize\nall of these gods. Ancient Vedic rituals encouraged knowledge of\ndiverse sciences, including astronomy, linguistics, and mathematics.\nAstronomical knowledge was required to determine the timing of rituals\nand the construction of sacrificial altars. Linguistics developed out\nof a need to formalize grammatical rules for classical Sanskrit, which\nwas used in rituals. Large public offerings also required the\nconstruction of elaborate altars, which posed geometrical problems and\nthus led to advances in geometry. Classic Vedic texts also frequently\nused very large numbers, for instance, to denote the age of humanity\nand the Earth, which required a system to represent numbers\nparsimoniously, giving rise to a 10-base positional system and a\nsymbolic representation for zero as a placeholder, which would later\nbe imported in other mathematical traditions (Joseph 1991 [2000]). In\nthis way, ancient Indian dharma encouraged the emergence of the\nsciences.\n\nAround the sixth\u2013fifth century BCE, the northern part of the\nIndian subcontinent experienced an extensive urbanization. In this\ncontext, medicine (\u0101yurveda) became standardized. This\nperiod also gave rise to a wide range of heterodox philosophical\nschools, including Buddhism, Jainism, and C\u0101rv\u0101ka. The\nlatter defended a form of metaphysical naturalism, denying the\nexistence of gods or karma. The relationship between science and\nreligion on the Indian subcontinent is complex, in part because the\ndharmic religions and philosophical schools are so diverse. For\nexample, C\u0101rv\u0101ka proponents had a strong suspicion of\ninferential beliefs, and rejected Vedic revelation and supernaturalism\nin general, instead favoring direct observation as a source of\nknowledge.\n\nNatural theology also flourished in the pre-colonial period,\nespecially in the Advaita Ved\u0101nta, a dar\u015bana that\nidentifies the self, \u0101tman, with ultimate reality,\nBrahman.  Advaita Ved\u0101ntin philosopher Adi \u015aa\u1e45kara\n(fl. first half eighth century) was an author who regarded Brahman as\nthe only reality, both the material and the efficient cause of the\ncosmos. \u015aa\u1e45kara formulated design and cosmological\narguments, drawing on analogies between the world and artifacts: in\nordinary life, we never see non-intelligent agents produce purposive\ndesign, yet the universe is suitable for human life, just like benches\nand pleasure gardens are designed for us. Given that the universe is\nso complex that even an intelligent craftsman cannot comprehend it,\nhow could it have been created by non-intelligent natural forces?\n\u015aa\u1e45kara concluded that it must have been designed by an\nintelligent creator (C.M. Brown 2008: 108).\n\nFrom 1757 to 1947, India was under British colonial rule. This had a\nprofound influence on its culture as Hindus came into contact with\nWestern science and technology. For local intellectuals, the contact\nwith Western science presented a challenge: how to assimilate these\nideas with Hinduism? Mahendrahal Sircar (1833\u20131904) was one of\nthe first authors to examine evolutionary theory and its implications\nfor Hindu religious beliefs. Sircar was an evolutionary theist, who\nbelieved that God used evolution to create current life forms.\nEvolutionary theism was not a new hypothesis in Hinduism, but the many\nlines of empirical evidence Darwin provided for evolution gave it a\nfresh impetus. While Sircar accepted organic evolution through common\ndescent, he questioned the mechanism of natural selection as it was\nnot teleological, which went against his evolutionary theism. This was\na widespread problem for the acceptance of evolutionary theory, one\nthat Christian evolutionary theists also wrestled with (Bowler 2009).\nHe also argued against the British colonists\u2019 beliefs that\nHindus were incapable of scientific thought, and encouraged fellow\nHindus to engage in science, which he hoped would help regenerate the\nIndian nation (C.M. Brown 2012: chapter 6).\n\nThe assimilation of Western culture prompted various revivalist\nmovements that sought to reaffirm the cultural value of Hinduism. They\nput forward the idea of a Vedic science, where all scientific findings\nare already prefigured in the Vedas and other ancient texts\n(e.g., Vivekananda 1904). This idea is still popular within\ncontemporary Hinduism, and is quite similar to ideas held by\ncontemporary Muslims, who refer to the Qur\u02be\u0101n as a harbinger\nof scientific theories.\n\nResponses to evolutionary theory were as diverse as Christian views on\nthis subject, ranging from creationism (denial of evolutionary theory\nbased on a perceived incompatibility with Vedic texts) to acceptance\n(see C.M. Brown 2012 for a thorough overview). Authors such as\nDayananda Saraswati (1930\u20132015) rejected evolutionary theory. By\ncontrast, Vivekananda (1863\u20131902), a proponent of the monistic\nAdvaita Ved\u0101nta enthusiastically endorsed evolutionary theory and\nargued that it is already prefigured in ancient Vedic texts. His\nintegrative view claimed that Hinduism and science are in harmony:\nHinduism is scientific in spirit, as is evident from its long history\nof scientific discovery (Vivekananda 1904). Sri Aurobindo Ghose, a\nyogi and Indian nationalist who was educated in the West, formulated a\nsynthesis of evolutionary thought and Hinduism. He interpreted the\nclassic avatara doctrine, according to which God incarnates\ninto the world repeatedly throughout time, in evolutionary terms. God\nthus appears first as an animal, later as a dwarf, then as a violent\nman (Rama), and then as Buddha, and as K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. He\nproposed a metaphysical picture where both spiritual evolution\n(reincarnation and avatars) and physical evolution are ultimately a\nmanifestation of God (Brahman). This view of reality as\nconsisting of matter (prak\u1e5bti) and consciousness\n(puru\u1e63a) goes back to s\u0101\u1e43khya, one\nof the orthodox Hindu dar\u015bana, but Aurobindo made\nexplicit reference to the divine, calling the process during which the\nsupreme Consciousness dwells in matter involution (Aurobindo,\n1914\u201318 [2005], see C.M. Brown 2007 for discussion).\n\nDuring the twentieth century, Indian scientists began to gain\nprominence, including C.V. Raman (1888\u20131970), a Nobel Prize\nwinner in physics, and Satyendra Nath Bose (1894\u20131974), a\ntheoretical physicist who described the behavior of photons\nstatistically, and who gave his name to bosons. However, these authors\nwere silent on the relationship between their scientific work and\ntheir religious beliefs. By contrast, the mathematician Srinivasa\nRamanujan (1887\u20131920) was open about his religious beliefs and\ntheir influence on his mathematical work. He claimed that the goddess\nNamagiri helped him to intuit solutions to mathematical problems.\nLikewise, Jagadish Chandra Bose (1858\u20131937), a theoretical\nphysicist, biologist, biophysicist, botanist, and archaeologist who\nworked on radio waves, saw the Hindu idea of unity reflected in the\nstudy of nature. He started the Bose institute in Kolkata in 1917, the\nearliest interdisciplinary scientific institute in India (Subbarayappa\n2011).\n",
