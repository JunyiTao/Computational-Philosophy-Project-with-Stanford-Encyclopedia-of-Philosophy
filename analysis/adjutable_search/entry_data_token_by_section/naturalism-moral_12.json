    "main_text": "Cornell Realism\n7. Jackson\u2019s Analytic Functionalism\n\nThe final version of naturalism that we\u2019ll look at is Frank\nJackson\u2019s moral functionalism. Jackson is an analytic\ndescriptivist. While his is not the only contemporary version of\nanalytic descriptivism (see Smith 1994; Finlay 2014; Rawlette 2020),\nit is the most influential. This view is typically described as\nJackson\u2019s, and the canonical statement of the view comes from\nhis book From Metaphysics to Ethics, though many of the ideas\nin that book were developed with Philip Pettit (Jackson and Pettit\n1995).\n\nAs we saw in Section 3.1, Jackson endorses the Direct Argument from\nsupervenience to naturalism. Because moral facts supervene on natural\nfacts, they are identical to natural facts. (Jackson talks about\n\u201cdescriptive\u201d facts rather than \u201cnatural\u201d\nfacts, but I\u2019ll continue to use \u201cnatural\u201d for the\nsake of consistency.) The problem now is to say which natural facts\nthe moral facts supervene on and are therefore identical to. Jackson\ncalls this the \u201clocation problem.\u201d The location problem\nisn\u2019t unique to ethics. Jackson expresses sympathy for\nphysicalism, the view that we could, in principle, give a complete\naccount of everything that exists in terms of the kinds of things that\nphysics does (or could) tell us about. Everything else that exists\nsupervenes on (and is therefore identical to) complexes of these\nfundamental physical things. But which complexes of fundamental\nphysical things are the various non-fundamental things identical to?\nLocation problems abound. Solving them is the task of \u201cserious\nmetaphysics\u201d (Jackson 1998, 1\u20138).\n\nSo how can we solve location problems? What is the method of serious\nmetaphysics? The first step is conceptual analysis. If we want to know\nwhat the Fs are, we need to have some idea of what we\u2019re talking\nabout when we\u2019re talking about \u201cthe Fs,\u201d and this\nunderstanding will frame our subsequent investigation. The first step\nin figuring out that water is H2O was understanding that\nwater is the clear, tasteless stuff that fills the rivers and lakes\nand falls from the sky as rain, rather than the intoxicating stuff\nfound in beer, wine, and liquor. If you thought that water was the\nintoxicating stuff in wine, you\u2019d end up drawing a very\ndifferent \u2013 and incorrect \u2013 conclusion about the\ncomposition of water (Jackson 1998, 28\u201331ff).\n\nBut wait! Putnam\u2019s Twin Earth thought experiment is supposed to\nshow that we can\u2019t discover the meaning of \u2018water\u2019\nby a process of conceptual analysis; the people on Twin Earth have the\nsame concept of \u2018water\u2019 as we do, but their word means\nsomething different. Jackson responds that Putnam and his followers\nhave drawn the wrong lesson from the Twin Earth case. The Twin Earth\nthought experiment doesn\u2019t show us that the concept of water\ncan\u2019t be analyzed; it shows that the concept can be analyzed,\nsince the Twin Earth thought experiment is itself a nice bit of\nconceptual analysis. Twin Earth \u2013 and all other thought\nexperiments \u2013 are nothing more than ways to elicit intuitions\nabout how to deploy our concepts in a variety of counterfactual\ncircumstances. The intuitions that we elicit from thought experiments\nare the stuff that conceptual analyses are made of. Putnam\u2019s\nconclusion that \u2018water\u2019 refers to whatever causally\nregulates the use of the term \u2018water\u2019 within a linguistic\ncommunity is itself a partial analysis of the concept of water\n(Jackson 1998, 39\u201379). Of course, merely having a conceptual\nanalysis like this in hand is not the end of our investigation. Now\nthat we know what we\u2019re looking for, empirical investigation\ntakes over and we investigate what the stuff is that causally\nregulates the use of the term \u2018water\u2019 within our\nlinguistic community. It turns out that that stuff is H2O.\nThat\u2019s how we solved the location problem for\n\u2018water.\u2019\n\nNow we have a general outline for how to solve location problems.\nFirst, consider cases where we would, on reflection, deploy some\nconcept (e.g. \u2018water.\u2019) The result of this reflection will\nbe some set of platitudes about that concept. Next, we turn this set\nof platitudes into a \u201cRamsay sentence.\u201d Take every\ninstance of the word \u2018water\u2019 (or whatever), and replace it\nwith a variable, X. So instead of \u201cWater falls from the sky as\nrain,\u201d we will have a collection of sentences that say things\nlike \u201cX falls from the sky as rain.\u201d This collection of\nRamsay sentences is a description of a functional role; in this case,\nthe water-role. Finally, we empirically investigate what, if anything,\nfulfills that role. We know that water is H2O because we\nfound, through empirical investigation, that H2O is the\nstuff that satisfies the water-role. In general, we know what Fs are\nby using conceptual analysis to figure out what the F-role is, and\nthen empirically investigating what, if anything, satisfies the F-role\n(Jackson 1998, Ch 2\u20133).\n\nWe can perform this process to solve the location problem in ethics.\nBegin with some moral concept, say \u201cgoodness.\u201d Then\nconsider a variety of cases where we would judge that something is\ngood. The result will be some set of platitudes about goodness. We can\nthen take those platitudes about goodness and turn them into a Ramsay\nsentence which describes the goodness-role. Finally, we investigate\nwhat, if anything, satisfies the goodness-role. That thing is goodness\n(Jackson 1998, Ch 5\u20136).\n\nWhat about multiple realizability? Jackson is attempting to provide a\nconceptual analysis of our moral concepts, but the Cornell realists\nthought that no such analysis is possible in part because goodness\n(e.g.) is realizable in a large number of very different things.\nJackson is unconcerned by this. If goodness supervenes on a large\nnumber of different descriptive properties, then goodness is identical\nto the disjunction of all of those descriptive properties on which it\nsupervenes. Goodness might be identical to a disjunction \u2013\nperhaps an infinitely large disjunction! \u2013 of other natural\nproperties (see also Sinhababu 2018).\n\nMany have found the suggestion that goodness is identical to an\ninfinite disjunction of natural properties to be metaphysically and\nepistemologically suspicious. Can an infinite disjunction of natural\nproperties really be a property? And how could we have knowledge of an\nugly gerrymandered property? Jackson replies that excessively\ndisjunctive properties are suspect, because they cannot play a causal\nrole (Jackson 1998, 106). But not all disjunctive properties \u2013\neven infinitely disjunctive properties \u2013 are excessively\ndisjunctive. Consider the property of baldness. Baldness supervenes on\n(and is therefore identical to) having a certain distribution of hair\non one\u2019s head. Well-known vagueness concerns about the predicate\n\u2018bald\u2019 may prevent us from giving a more compact\ndescription of what it takes for someone to be bald. But there is some\nlarge \u2013 perhaps infinitely large \u2013 set of hair\ndistributions which we would, on reflection, definitely consider to be\nbald. Baldness is therefore identical to an infinitely large\ndisjunction of hair distributions. But that doesn\u2019t mean that\nthere\u2019s anything metaphysically or epistemically weird about\nbeing bald. Many people are bald, many claims to the effect that\nsomeone is bald are true, and in most cases it is not particularly\ndifficult to ascertain whether or not someone is bald. Jackson urges\nus to say precisely the same thing about moral properties (124).\n\nA second worry: When we assemble the platitudes about our concept of\n\u201cgoodness,\u201d we will find that many of them implicate other\nmoral concepts. \u201cIf something is good, then you have a reason to\npursue it.\u201d \u201cVirtuous character traits are good.\u201d\nAnd so on. So we can\u2019t analyze the concept of goodness into\nplatitudes and then investigate what satisfies those platitudes, since\nmany of those platitudes will concern moral concepts that are equally\nin need of analysis. Jackson\u2019s solution to this problem is to\nanalyze all of the moral concepts together. Take all of the platitudes\nconcerning goodness or value or wrongness or virtue, etc. Replace\nevery instance of \u201cgood\u201d with a variable (g), replace\nevery instance of \u201cvalue\u201d with another variable (v),\nreplace every instance of \u201cwrong\u201d with another variable\n(w), etc. The result is the functional role description of the\nnetwork of our moral concepts. Goodness and value and\nwrongness are then the g, the v, and the w (etc.) that satisfy all of\nthe platitudes concerning g, v, and w (etc.).\n\nA final worry: Which platitudes are we to select as the platitudes\nthat appear in our analysis? The ones that we endorse on reflection?\nBut who is the \u201cwe\u201d who would endorse these platitudes on\nreflection? How much reflection must we undergo? Jackson answers this\nworry by appeal to the concept of a mature folk morality. A\nfolk morality is \u201cthe network of moral opinions, intuitions,\nprinciples and concepts whose mastery is part and parcel of having a\nsense of what is right and wrong, and of being able to engage in\nmeaningful debate about what ought to be done\u201d (130). This folk\nmorality is then revised by hunting out inconsistencies within\none\u2019s moral commitments and engaging in moral discussion with\nothers, identifying disagreements, and hammering out any differences.\nThe resulting mature moral theory will be both individually and\ninterpersonally coherent. That\u2019s the final statement of the\nview: The moral properties are whatever satisfies the network analysis\nof the platitudes that make up mature folk morality.\n\nJackson\u2019s appeal to a mature folk morality is his main ward\nagainst the Open Question Argument. To ask \u201cX is\npleasurable, but is X good?\u201d is, in effect, to ask\nwhether \u201cPleasure is good\u201d is one of the platitudes that\nwill feature in our mature folk morality. But we don\u2019t have a\nmature folk morality yet \u2013 we may not have one for a very long\ntime \u2013 and we have no way of knowing at this point what\nplatitudes will feature in it. Of course the question remains\nopen.\n\nThe fact that we don\u2019t know what the mature folk morality looks\nlike also shows that Jackson\u2019s idea of an infinitely disjunctive\nproperty isn\u2019t a core commitment of the view. If our mature folk\nmorality is a vast, heterogeneous collection of principles and cases,\nthen only an infinitely disjunctive property could satisfy it. But our\nmature folk morality could well be simple and compact. Whether we end\nup with a compact formulation or an infinite disjunction depends on\nthe outcome of a process we have not yet seen the end of.\n\nNow to some harder objections. One objection holds that\nJackson\u2019s view isn\u2019t really a version of analytic\nnaturalism, because the process of refining our mature folk morality\nwill be the result of not just moral discussion and reflection, but\nalso our observations of the real world (Lane 2018). Relatedly, one\nmight worry whether the platitudes of mature folk morality are really\nconceptual truths. Someone might disagree with a mature consensus not\nas a result of conceptual confusion but as a matter of genuine moral\ndisagreement (Zangwill 2000).\n\nA second objection concerns how we should understand\n\u201cmature\u201d folk morality. We don\u2019t want any endpoint\nof moral theorizing to count as \u201cmature;\u201d if mature folk\nmorality is just the theory we end up with in the future, whatever\nthat might be, then why should we care about it? Maybe people in the\nfuture will have the wrong moral beliefs! But if we define maturity in\nnormative terms, as the outcome of a good process of deliberation (or\nsomething similar), Jackson hasn\u2019t really succeeded in providing\nthe reductive naturalistic account of normativity that he was hoping\nfor (Yablo 2000).\n\nWe might also worry that no mature folk morality will ever emerge. If\nmoral disagreement persists into the indefinite future, just as it has\npersisted throughout human history, there is no mature folk morality\nand thus no set of platitudes that determines the moral facts. Jackson\nconcedes that this is a real problem: if there is no convergence in\nmoral attitudes, his methodology would imply moral relativism. He can\nonly offer hope that convergence will occur some day (137\u20138).\nAnd so Jackson\u2019s ambitious metaethical project turns out to rest\non an appeal to optimism.\n",
