    "main_text": "Causation || Backwards Causation\n3.1 Backwards Causation\nEarlier we distinguished changing the past and affecting the past,\nand argued that while the former is impossible, backwards time travel\nneed involve only the latter. Affecting the past would be an example\nof backwards causation (i.e. causation where the effect precedes its\ncause)\u2014and it has been argued that this too is impossible, or at\nleast \n problematic.[18]\n The classic argument against backwards\ncausation is the bilking\n argument.[19] \nFaced with the claim that some event A causes an earlier\nevent B, the proponent of the bilking objection recommends an\nattempt to decorrelate A and B\u2014that is, to bring\nabout A in cases in which B has not occurred, and to\nprevent A in cases in which B has occurred. If the\nattempt is successful, then B often occurs despite the\nsubsequent nonoccurrence of A, and A often occurs\nwithout B occurring, and so A cannot be the cause\nof B. If, on the other hand, the attempt is\nunsuccessful\u2014if, that is, A cannot be prevented\nwhen B has occurred, nor brought about when B has not\noccurred\u2014then, it is argued, it must be B that is the\ncause of A, rather than vice versa.\n\n\nThe bilking procedure requires repeated manipulation of\nevent A. Thus, it cannot get under way in cases in\nwhich A is either unrepeatable or unmanipulable. Furthermore,\nthe procedure requires us to know whether or not B has\noccurred, prior to manipulating A\u2014and thus, it cannot get\nunder way in cases in which it cannot be known whether or not B\nhas occurred until after the occurrence or nonoccurrence of A\n(Dummett, 1964). These three loopholes allow room for many claims of\nbackwards causation that cannot be touched by the bilking argument,\nbecause the bilking procedure cannot be performed at all. But what\nabout those cases in which it can be performed? If the procedure\nsucceeds\u2014that is, A and B are\ndecorrelated\u2014then the claim that A causes B is\nrefuted, or at least weakened (depending upon the details of the\ncase). But if the bilking attempt fails, it does not follow that it\nmust be B that is the cause of A, rather than vice\nversa. Depending upon the situation, that B causes A\nmight become a viable alternative to the hypothesis that A\ncauses B\u2014but there is no reason to think that this\nalternative must always be the superior one. For example, suppose that\nI see a photo of you in a paper dated well before your birth,\naccompanied by a report of your arrival from the future. I now try to\nbilk your upcoming time trip\u2014but I slip on a banana peel while\nrushing to push you away from your time machine, my time travel horror\nstories only inspire you further, and so on. Or again, suppose that I\nknow that you were not in Sydney yesterday. I now try to get you to go\nthere in your time machine\u2014but first I am struck by lightning,\nthen I fall down a manhole, and so on. What does all this prove?\nSurely not that your arrival in the past causes your departure from\nthe future. Depending upon the details of the case, it seems that we\nmight well be entitled to describe it as involving backwards time\ntravel and backwards causation. At least, if we are not so entitled,\nthis must be because of other facts about the case: it would not\nfollow simply from the repeated coincidental failures of my bilking\nattempts.\n",
