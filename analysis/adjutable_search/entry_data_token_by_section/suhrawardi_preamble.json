    "main_text": "\n\nTrained in Avicennan Peripateticism, Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawardi\n(1154\u20131191) has become the eponym of an\n\u2018Illuminationist\u2019 (ishraqi) philosophical\ntradition. Since none of his works was translated into Latin, he\nremained unknown in the West. However, a number of philosophical\ncircles in the Islamic East studied his works from the 13th\ncentury onwards. Around the mid-20th century, Henry Corbin\nworked relentlessly to edit and publish Suhrawardi\u2019s works,\nefforts that generated much interest in his novel philosophical\nsystem, which a new generation of scholars rekindled in the 1990s.\n\nSuhrawardi provides an original Platonic critique of the dominant\nAvicennan Peripateticism of the time in the fields of logic, physics,\nepistemology, psychology, and metaphysics. In so doing, he elaborates\nhis own epistemological (logic and psychology) and metaphysical\n(ontology and cosmology) ishraqi notions, concepts and\ntheories. He divided logic into three-parts, rejecting\nAvicenna\u2019s Peripatetic essentialist definition, and reducing the\nnumber of forms of the syllogism. In physics, he rejected\nAvicenna\u2019s hylomorphism, while bodies became magnitude with\naccidents.\n\nHis new epistemological perspective led him to critique the Avicennan\nPeripatetic theory of definition, to introduce a theory of\n\u2018presential\u2019 knowledge (mirroring mystical intuition), to\nelaborate a complex ontology of lights, and to add a fourth\nontological \u2018world of images\u2019 where imagination plays an\ninnovative eschatological function, expanding on insightful allusions\nmade by Avicenna. \n",
