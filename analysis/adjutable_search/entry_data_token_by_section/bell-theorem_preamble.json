    "main_text": "\n\nBell\u2019s Theorem is the collective name for a family of\nresults, all of which involve the derivation, from a condition on\nprobability distributions inspired by considerations of local\ncausality, together with auxiliary assumptions usually thought of as\nmild side-assumptions, of probabilistic predictions about the results\nof spatially separated experiments that conflict, for appropriate\nchoices of quantum states and experiments, with quantum mechanical\npredictions. These probabilistic predictions take the form of\ninequalities that must be satisfied by correlations derived from any\ntheory satisfying the conditions of the proof, but which are violated,\nunder certain circumstances, by correlations calculated from quantum\nmechanics. Inequalities of this type are known as Bell\ninequalities, or sometimes, Bell-type inequalities.\nBell\u2019s theorem shows that no theory that satisfies the\nconditions imposed can reproduce the probabilistic predictions of\nquantum mechanics under all circumstances. \n\nThe principal condition used to derive Bell inequalities is a\ncondition that may be called Bell locality, or\nfactorizability. It is, roughly, the condition that any\ncorrelations between distant events be explicable in local terms, as\ndue to states of affairs at the common source of the\nparticles upon which the experiments are performed. See section 3.1\nfor a more careful statement.\n\nThe incompatibility of theories satisfying the conditions that entail\nBell inequalities with the predictions of quantum mechanics permits an\nexperimental adjudication between the class of theories satisfying\nthose conditions and the class, which includes quantum mechanics, of\ntheories that violate those conditions. At the time that Bell\nformulated his theorem, it was an open question whether, under the\ncircumstances considered, the Bell inequality-violating correlations\npredicted by quantum mechanics were realized in nature. Beginning in\nthe 1970s, there has been a series of experiments of increasing\nsophistication to test whether the Bell inequalities are satisfied.\nWith few exceptions, the results of these experiments have confirmed\nthe quantum mechanical predictions, violating the relevant Bell\nInequalities. Until recently, however, each of these experiments was\nvulnerable to at least one of two loopholes, referred to as the\ncommunication, or locality loophole, and the\ndetection loophole (see section 5). Finally, in 2015,\nexperiments were performed that demonstrated violation of Bell\ninequalities with these loopholes blocked. This has consequences for\nour physical worldview; the conditions that entail Bell inequalities\nare, arguably, an integral part of the physical worldview that was\naccepted prior to the advent of quantum mechanics. If one accepts the\nlessons of the experimental results, then some one or other of these\nconditions must be rejected.\n\nFor much of the interval between the original publication of\nBell\u2019s theorem and the experiments of Aspect and his collaborators, interest in Bell\u2019s theorem was confined to a handful of\nphysicists and philosophers. During that period, much of the\ndiscussions on the foundations of physics occurred in a mimeographed\npublication entitled Epistemological Letters. In the wake of\nthe Aspect experiments (Aspect, Grangier, and Roger, 1982; Aspect,\nDalibard, and Roger 1982), there was considerable philosophical\ndiscussion of the implications of Bell\u2019s theorem; see Cushing\nand McMullin, eds. (1989), for a snapshot of the philosophical\ndiscussions of the time. Interest was also stimulated by the\npublication of a collection of Bell\u2019s papers on the foundations\nof quantum mechanics (Bell 1987b). The rise of quantum information\ntheory, which, among other things, explores the ways in which quantum\nentanglement can be used to perform tasks that would not be feasible\nclassically, also contributed to raising awareness of the significance\nof Bell\u2019s theorem, which throws into sharp relief the difference\nbetween quantum entanglement-based correlations and classical\ncorrelations. The year 2014 was the 50th anniversary of the original\npublication of Bell\u2019s theorem, and was marked by a special issue\nof Journal of Physics A (47, number 42, 24\nOctober 2014), a collection of essays (Bell and Gao, eds., 2016), and\na large conference comprising over 400 attendees (see Bertlmann and\nZeilinger, eds., 2017). The interested reader is urged to consult\nthese collections for an overview of current discussions on topics\nsurrounding Bell\u2019s theorem.\n",
