    "main_text": "Major Themes in Clarke || Rationalism\n2.2 Rationalism\n\nClarke adopted some form of rationalism in metaphysics, ethics, and\ntheology, as exhibited in his methodology, his account of ethical\ntruths, and in his acceptance of a fundamental rationalist principle,\nthe principle of sufficient reason. The principle of sufficient reason\nwas used both in Clarke\u2019s positive metaphysical arguments and was\nassumed in his arguments against other philosophers, especially\nSpinoza, whom he chastises for failing to explain the diversity of\nthings that exist (Yenter 2014).\n\nClarke is also an ethical rationalist. Ethical truths are discoverable\nthrough reason and correspond to necessary and eternal relations among\nthings in the world. He also calls ethical truths \u201ctruths of\nreason.\u201d His theology is also rationalist, in that through\nreason one can discover the many truths contained in natural religion.\nFurthermore, true Christian doctrines are neither mysterious nor\nself-contradictory, and nearly all can be comprehended by human\nbeings.\n\nMost importantly, the Demonstration makes great use of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, which motivates the cosmological\nargument, and he explicitly and repeatedly avows it in the\ncorrespondence with Leibniz (C 3.2, W 4.606). It is not mentioned in\nthe correspondence with Collins, but he there adopts principles that\ncan be derived from it. Clarke\u2019s understanding of the principle\nof sufficient reason differs notably from Leibniz\u2019s formulation,\nwith whom it is more frequently associated. This was a major source of\ncontention in their correspondence. Clarke asserts that the sufficient\nreason why something exists as it does may be due to the \u201cmere\nWill\u201d of God and nothing more (C 3.2, W 4.606\u2013607; C\n5.124\u2013130, W 4.700). This involves two claims. First, in cases\nof complete indifference (such as God choosing where to place the\nworld in the infinite expanse of absolute space), God is capable of\nacting even if there is no reason to prefer one option over another.\nSecond, a free will is able to refrain from acting on what reason\npresents to it as best to do. As a consequence of these, Clarke denies\nthe identity of indiscernibles. This is significant for Clarke\u2019s\nNewtonianism, because if space is real and absolute, then the identity\nof indiscernibles must be false because regions of space are\nindiscernible with respect to their intrinsic and (prior to the\ncreation of the world) their extrinsic properties. Clarke may also\nhave felt the need to accommodate indiscernible atoms, which Newton\nseemed to allow. (Clarke defends atomism in the letters to Leibniz,\nbut in his other works he claims that all matter is infinitely\ndivisible.) Because Clarke denies the identity of indiscernibles and\naffirms libertarianism, Leibniz claims that Clarke grants the\nprinciple of sufficient reason \u201conly in Words, and in reality\ndenies it. Which shews that he does not fully perceive the Strength of\nit\u201d (L 3.2, W 4.601). In response, Clarke argues that if Leibniz\nis right then a free agent would be merely passive because determined\nto do what reason presents, but a \u201cpassive agent\u201d is a\ncontradiction since the concept of agency includes the concept of\nactivity. Leibniz was never satisfied with Clarke\u2019s position and by\nthe fifth letter he was more explicit than previously that the\nprinciple of sufficient reason and the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles are not independent but the latter is derived from the\nformer (L 5.21), and in the fifth letter\u2019s cover letter, sent to\nPrincess Caroline, Leibniz asserts, \u201cIf [Clarke] does not entirely\naccept the received great principle that nothing happens without there\nbeing a sufficient reason why it happens thus rather than otherwise, I\ncould not help doubting his sincerity, and if he grants it then\nfarewell to the philosophy of Monsieur Newton\u201d (quoted in Khamara\n2006, 4).\n\nClarke\u2019s rationalism is tempered by his discussions of faith in\nreason, especially in his writings against the Deists. Against the\nDeists, who generally expected all necessary moral and religious\ntruths to be discoverable by reason, Clarke asserted that revealed\nreligion (also called special revelation) provided information\nnecessary for salvation (W 2.666\u2013667). While special revelation\ninvolved \u201csupplying the deficiencies\u201d of \u201cright reason,\u201d it\ncould not contradict reason (W 2.669).\n",
