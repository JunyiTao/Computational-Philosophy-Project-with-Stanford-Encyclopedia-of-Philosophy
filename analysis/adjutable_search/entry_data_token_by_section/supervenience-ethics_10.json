    "main_text": "Arguments from Ethical Supervenience || Supervenience and moral epistemology\n3.4 Supervenience and moral epistemology\n\nSo far, this entry has focused on the significance of supervenience\nfor claims about the nature of ethical thought, talk, and metaphysics.\nHowever, influential early discussions of this sort of thesis seemed\nto have something else in mind. For example,\n Section 2\n above quoted an evocative passage from Henry Sidgwick. But\nSidgwick\u2019s point was not to argue about the metaphysics of\nethics. Rather, he was proposing a supervenience-like idea as an\nepistemological corrective to ad hoc special pleading in one\u2019s\nethical reasoning (1907, 209).\n\nThe mere fact of supervenience could not play this sort of role: after\nall, the supervenience of the ethical is compatible with the idea that\neveryone ought always to do what I want them to do. However, Sidgwick\npoints to an important idea: that we expect there to be a rational\nexplanation for any ethical fact. One ambitious way of developing this\nidea has been suggested by Nick Zangwill (2006). According to\nZangwill, a central conceptual constraint on ethical reasoning is the\n\u201cbecause constraint\u201d: when we judge something to be wrong\n(or to have another ethical property), we are committed to its having\nthis property because it has some other property. Zangwill\nclaims that this principle \u201ceither is, or explains\u201d\nethical supervenience (2006, 273). And Zangwill goes on to argue that\nthis constraint has striking epistemological implications: he claims\nthat it entails that our only epistemic access to facts about\nthe distribution of ethical properties is by knowing about the\ndistribution of base properties, and knowing ethical principles that\nlink the presence of base properties to ethical properties. He then\nargues that our knowledge of these ethical principles could itself\nonly be a priori (2006, 276). If Zangwill is right about this, then\nthe a priori character of moral epistemology can be derived from\nclaims about the supervenience of the ethical.\n\nOne worry about this argument is that it might overgeneralize. The\n\u201cbecause\u201d structure seems to be shared by other normative\ndomains: it would be very odd to claim that a particular chess move\nwas winning, or that a particular action was illegal, without being\ncommitted to their being some general explanation in terms of the\nrules of chess, or the relevant laws, that explains this particular\nfact. But our knowledge of the law and the rules of chess is\nempirical. So one might wonder what precisely prevents our knowledge\nof ethical principles being empirical as well.\n",
