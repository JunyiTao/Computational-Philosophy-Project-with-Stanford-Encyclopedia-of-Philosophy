Welfare Economics\n\nWelfare economics is the traditional generic label of normative\neconomics, but, in spite of substantial variations between authors, it\nnow tends to be associated with a particular subcontinent of this\ndomain, maybe as a result of the development of\n\u201cnon-welfarist\u201d approaches and of approaches with a\nbroader scope, such as the theory of social choice.\n\nSurveys on welfare economics in its restricted definition can be found\nin Graff (1957), Boadway and Bruce (1984), Chipman and Moore (1978),\nSamuelson (1981). Many topics of welfare economics are addressed in\nthe more recent handbooks by Arrow, Sen and Suzumura (2002, 2011),\nAtkinson and Bourguignon (2000, 2015) and Adler and Fleurbaey (2016).\nAccessible introductions are given by (book-length) Adler (2019) and\n(article-length) Fleurbaey (2019).\n",
