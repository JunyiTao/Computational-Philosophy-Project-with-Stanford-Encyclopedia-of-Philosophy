Recall the\nearlier suggestion that accounts of alienation require some benchmark\ncondition of harmony or connectedness against which separations might\nbe assessed as problematic or not.\n\nHistorically, this role\u2014identifying whether candidate\nseparations are problematic\u2014has often been played by accounts of\nour essential human nature. However, motivated by suspicion of that\nlatter idea, theorists of alienation have sometimes sought\nalternatives to fulfil that role.\n",
