    "main_text": "Leibniz and Wolff: Perfection and Truth || Wolff\n1.2 Wolff\n\nThis is the background from which Wolff\u2019s own hints toward aesthetics\nemerged. Wolff introduces the central concepts and principles of his\nontology in the second chapter of his German metaphysics, which deals\nwith \u201cThe first grounds of our cognition and all things in\ngeneral\u201d (German Metaphysics, p. 66). After expounding\nthe formal principles that are the basis of all truth, the principles\nof non-contradiction and sufficient reason, Wolff introduces the\nconcept that is the substantive basis of his ontology, namely the\nconcept of perfection. He defines perfection as the\n\u201charmony\u201d or \u201cconcordance\u201d\n(Zusammenstimmung) of a manifold or multiplicity of objects\nor parts of objects\u2014or as he says in Latin, perfectio est\nconsensus in varietate (Wolff, Ontologia, \u00a7503,\np. 390)\u2014and illustrates this abstract definition with the\nexample of a work of technology:\n\n\n E.g., one judges the perfection of a clock from its correctly\n displaying the hours and their parts. It is however composed of many\n parts, and these and their composition are aimed at the hands\n displaying correctly the hours and their parts. Thus in a clock one\n finds manifold things, that are all in concordance with one another.\n (Wolff, German Metaphysics, \u00a7152, p. 152)\n\n\nHere Wolff defines perfection in both formal and substantive terms:\nformally, simply as the order or harmony of the parts in a whole; but\nsubstantively, as the suitability of that order or harmony of parts\nfor achieving the aim that is intended for the whole, such as\naccurately telling time in the case of a clock.\n\n\nWhen we turn to Wolff\u2019s conceptions of the perfections of the\nparticular forms of art that he mentions, we see that he always\nhas in mind both formal and substantive perfections for any particular\nart. Wolff also identifies order in\nthings with truth. He says that\n Since everything has its sufficient ground why it\nis, there must also always be a sufficient ground for why in simple\nthings the alterations succeed one another just so and not otherwise,\nand why in composite things their parts are juxtaposed just thus and\nnot otherwise, and also their alterations succeed one another just so\nand not otherwise.\n\n\nHe contrasts this order with the disorder that reigns in dreams,\nand then says that\nAccordingly truth is nothing other than\n order in the alternations of things while the dream is\n disorder in the alteration of things. (German Metaphysics,\n \u00a7142, pp.  146\u20138)\n\n\nIn a 1729 lecture on \u201cThe enjoyment that\n one can derive from the cognition of truth,\u201d Wolff does not in\n the first instance treat truth as a semantic correspondence between a\n linguistic representation and the object represented, or an epistemic\n relation between a mental representation and an external reality, but\n as an objective property consisting in coherence within things\n themselves, which is precisely what perfection consists in as\n well. But there is nevertheless a strongly cognitivist cast to\n Wolff\u2019s aesthetics.\n\n\nWolff next defines clarity and distinctness and indistinctness in\ncognition. Thoughts are clear \u201cwhen we know well what we think,\nand can distinguish that from other things\u201d; they are obscure if\nwe cannot even distinguish the objects of our thoughts from other\nobjects (German Metaphysics, \u00a7\u00a7198\u20139, p.\n188). Clear thoughts are also distinct if we not only know what\nobjects we are thinking of but if \u201cour thoughts are also clear\nwith respect to their parts or the manifold that is to be found in\nthem\u201d (German Metaphysics, \u00a7207, p. 194), and are\notherwise indistinct or confused. Wolff then defines sensations\n(Empfindungen) as those thoughts \u201cwhich have their\nground in the alterations of the members of our body and which are\noccasioned by corporeal things outside us,\u201d and the\n\u201ccapacity for having sensations as the senses\u201d\n(German Metaphysics, \u00a7220, p. 202). He then adopts\nLeibniz\u2019s view that sensations or sensory perceptions are typically\nclear but indistinct or confused (German Metaphyics,\n\u00a7214, p. 198). Unlike Leibniz, the systematic Wolff observes that\nsensations come in differing degrees of clarity (German\nMetaphysics, \u00a7224, p. 206), but they are nevertheless all\nindistinct to some degree. This means that at least in principle a\npurely intellectual or conceptual representation is always a better\nsource of knowledge of its object than is a sensory representation of\nit.\n\n\nThis in turn means that an aesthetic perception of a perfection is\nalways a less than optimal cognition of that perfection, for having\ndescribed sense perception or sensory cognition as clear but\nindistinct or confused, Wolff next defines pleasure as the sensory or\n\u201cintuitive\u201d cognition of perfection. In his German\nmetaphysics, he writes that \u201cInsofar as we intuit perfection,\npleasure arises in us, thus pleasure is nothing other than an\nintuition of perfection, as Descartes already remarked\u201d\n(German Metaphysics, \u00a7404, p. 344). Wolff\u2019s successors\nwill struggle to avoid the limitations on the cognitive significance\nof aesthetic response that follow from his definition of pleasure as a\nkind of sense perception and the limits he places on the cognitive\nsignificance of sense perception.\n\n\nWhile Wolff\u2019s basic account of pleasure is problematic, he does\nprovide a straightforward account of beauty. Wolff defines beauty as\nthe perfection of an object insofar it can be perceived by us with and\nthrough the feeling of pleasure: \u201cBeauty consists in the\nperfection of a thing, insofar as it is suitable for producing\npleasure in us\u201d (Psychologia Empirica, \u00a7544,\np. 420).  This definition enunciates a clear position on the\nontological status of beauty, which will often be vexed in the\neighteenth century.  Beauty is an objective property, founded in the\nperfection of things, but it is also a relational rather than\nintrinsic property, for it is attributed to perfection only insofar as\nthere are subjects like us who can perceive it sensorily. Given\nperceivers like us, beauty is coextensive with or emergent from\nperfection, but in a universe without such perceivers perfection would\nnot be equivalent to beauty.\n\n\nThus far we have considered only Wolff\u2019s most abstract definition of\nperfection and therefore of beauty, namely that it is the coherence of\na manifold insofar as we can perceive that through the sensation of\npleasure. When he mentions or discusses specific arts, Wolff invokes\nmore specific conceptions of perfection and thus of the beauties of\nthose arts. In the case of the visual arts of painting and sculpture,\nWolff locates their perfection in imitation or veridical\nrepresentation, while other arts find their perfections in the\nfulfillment of intended uses. He uses the examples of painting and\narchitecture in the German metaphysics to illustrate his claim that\npleasure arises from the intuition of perfection. Thus,\nthe perfection of a painting consists in its\nsimilarity. For since a painting is nothing other than a\nrepresentation of a given object on a tablet or flat surface,\neverything in it is harmonious if nothing can be discerned in it that\none does not also perceive in the thing itself,\n\n\nand\nif a connoisseur of architecture contemplates a\n building that has been constructed in accordance with the rules of\n architecture, he thereby cognizes its perfection. (German\n Metaphysics, \u00a7404, p. 344)\n\n\nWolff frequently reiterates that the perfection of painting or\nsculpture consists in accurate representation without further\namplification (\u201cOn the enjoyment that can be derived from the\ncognition of truth,\u201d \u00a77, p. 257, and Psychologia\nEmpirica, \u00a7512, pp. 389\u201390, and \u00a7544,\npp. 420\u20131); he is simply using what he takes to be a\nnon-controversial fact about painting to confirm his connection of\npleasure with the intuition of perfection. In his extended discussion\nof architecture, however, he reveals a more subtle conception of the\nperfections and thus the \u201crules\u201d of architecture.  In order for us to\nperceive it as beautiful, a building must display both the formal\nperfection of coherence as well as the substantive perfection of being\nsuitable, indeed comfortable for its intended use.\n\n\nWolff begins his treatise on the Foundations of Architecture\nwith the claim that \u201carchitecture is a science for constructing\na building so that it is in complete correspondence with the\nintentions of the architect\u201d (Wolff, Principles of\nArchitecture, \u00a71, p. 305). This locates the harmony or\nagreement in which perfection always consists in the relation between\nthe intentions of the architect and the building that results from his\nplans and supervision. However, as he proceeds Wolff makes it clear\nthat the intention of an architect is always to produce a structure\nthat is both formally beautiful as well as useful and comfortable, so\nthe perfection that subsists in the relation between intention and\noutcome in fact consists in the perfection of both form and utility in\nthe building itself. On the one hand \u201cA\nbuilding is space that is enclosed by art in order that certain\nfunctions can proceed there securely and unhindered\u201d\n(Architecture, \u00a74, p. 306), and \u201cA building\nis comfortable if all necessary functions can proceed within it\nwithout hindrance and vexation\u201d (Architecture, \u00a77,\np.  307). These definitions form the basis for a requirement of\nperfection in the utility of a building. On the other hand, however,\n\u201cBeauty is perfection or the necessary appearance thereof,\ninsofar as the former or the latter is perceived, and causes a\npleasure in us\u201d (Architecture, \u00a78, p. 307), and \u201cA building must be constructed beautifully\nand decoratively\u201d (Architecture, \u00a718, p. 309).\nThis is the basis for the requirement of formal rather than\nutilitarian perfection in a building. Throughout the remainder of the\ntreatise, both conceptions of perfection are at work. Wolff does not\nexplicitly extend this complex analysis of perfection to other arts,\nalthough it is not difficult to imagine how that extension might go:\nin painting we might respond to formal features of composition as well\nas to the accuracy of depiction, in sculpture we might respond to the\nintrinsic beauty of the marble or bronze as well as to the accuracy of\ndepiction, and so on.\n\n\nFinally, we must ask about the moral and religious implications of\nWolff\u2019s contributions to aesthetics. As we have seen, Wolff equates\nperfection, which is the object of pleasure in all contexts including\nthose subsequently labeled aesthetic, with an objective sense of\ntruth. However, and in this regard most unlike the German\naestheticians of the next several generations who are so strongly\ninfluenced by him in other regards, he has nothing to say about the\narts that are typically paradigmatic for those who ground their\naesthetics on the notion of truth rather than that of play, namely\nliterature, especially poetry and drama. Thus he does not consider the\nparadox of tragedy, formulated by Du Bos and then discussed by\nvirtually every other eighteenth-century writer on literature, nor\ndoes he emphasize the moral benefits of uplifting literature, as so\nmany others do. Indeed, he has nothing explicit to say about the moral\nbenefits of aesthetic experience, nor does he directly consider the\nreligious significance of such experience in any of his discussions of\nit. Nevertheless, it is clear that aesthetic experience does have\nreligious significance for Wolff, because his philosophy culminates in\na religious teleology. For Wolff, the most perfect and therefore most\norderly of all possible worlds exists for a reason, namely to mirror\nthe perfection of God, and sentient and cognizant beings such as\nourselves exist for a reason, namely to recognize and admire the\nperfection of God that is mirrored in the perfection of things in the\nworld and of the world as a whole. The perfection that is added to the\nnatural world through human artistry is also part of the perfection of\nthe world that emanates from and mirrors the perfection of God. Thus,\nin admiring the perfection of art we are performing part of our larger\nfunction in the world, namely admiring the perfection of God. Wolff\nstates the premise of his teleology quite clearly in a work devoted\nentirely to that subject, the Rational Thoughts on the Aims of\nNatural Things, or \u201cGerman teleology.\u201d There he\ndeclares that\nThe chief aim of the world is this, that we should\n cognize the perfection of God from it. Now if God would attain this\n aim, he also had to arrange the world in such a way that a rational\n being could extract from the contemplation of it grounds that would\n allow him to infer with certainty the properties of God and what can\n be known about him. (Rational Thoughts on the Aims of Natural\n Things, \u00a78, p. 6)\n\n\nSeveral sections later, he uses the metaphor of\nthe mirror to describe the relation between God, the world, and we who\nlook at the mirror:\nNow if the world is to be a mirror of the wisdom\n of God, then we must encounter divine aims in it and perceive the\n means by which he attains these aims\u2026. And accordingly the\n connection of things in the world with one another makes it into a\n mirror of [God\u2019s] wisdom\u2026. (ibid., \u00a714, pp.  18\u201319;\n see also German Metaphysics, \u00a71045, p.\n 802)\n\n\n\nWolff writes as a spokesman for the Enlightenment, and he is emphatic\nthat God reveals his wisdom and power not by intervening in the course\nof the world by means of miracles, but rather by designing everything\nin the world as if it were all smoothly-running machines that can\nachieve his goals without further intervention (see German\nMetaphysics, \u00a71037, p. 796). This might seem to leave no\nroom at all for the human creation of art, which all\neighteenth-century writers will conceive of as a production of genius\nthat is the complete opposite of anything mechanical. But for Wolff\nour ability to produce works of art is another manifestation of the\nperfection of the world\u2014of which we are a part\u2014and in turn\nof God. Wolff draws no distinction between the works of human art that\nare the subject of the \u201cscience of art\u201d and the works of\nnature, nor for that matter any distinction between the works of human\nart that are the subject of the \u201cscience of art\u201d and those\nhuman creations that are the subjects of the \u201cdoctrine of morals\nand statecraft\u201d: they are all forms of perfection which, in a\nteleological natural theology, all ultimately mirror the perfection of\nGod. And no doubt Wolff hardly thought it necessary to spell out the\nmoral benefits of such a recognition.\n",
