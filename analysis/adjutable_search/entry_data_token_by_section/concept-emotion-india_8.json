    "main_text": "The Buddhist account of the emotions || Buddhist emotions\n5. Conclusion\n\nA number of themes emerge from this overview: 1) The Western\ncategories of \u201ccognition\u201d and \u201cemotion\u201d do not\nhave equivalents in classical Indian philosophy. This is interesting\nbecause it suggests that these concepts are not psychological\ncategories but perhaps social categories. While there has been some\nanthropological work done by, for example, Catherine Lutz on the\ndifferences in the categorization of specific emotions across\ncultures, there is the possibility that the category as a whole might\nnot translate into all cultures (see Danziger 1997). 2) One common\ntheme in classical Indian philosophy is that the phenomena that would\nbe labelled as \u201cemotions\u201d in Western philosophy are to be\neradicated because they prevent liberation. 3) None of the Indian\nphilosophical schools aim at \u201cemotion-free\u201d cognitions as\nan end in itself. In fact, those states that would be labelled\n\u201ccognitions\u201d in Western philosophy are also to be\neradicated because they also prevent liberation. 4) Indian schools\ndiffer over the inclusion of feeling states under the concept of\nvij\u00f1\u0101na (cognition). Some schools distinguish\nbetween feeling states and vij\u00f1\u0101na whereas\nothers, most notably Buddhists, do not. This last point suggests that\nthere is an interesting comparison to be made between Buddhist\naccounts and cognitive accounts of the emotions. However, any\ncomparison must be sensitive to the difficulties in translating the\nconcepts involved.\n",
