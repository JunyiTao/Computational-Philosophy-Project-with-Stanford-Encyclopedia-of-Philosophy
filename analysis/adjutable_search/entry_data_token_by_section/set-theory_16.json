    "main_text": "The search for new axioms\n9. The search for new axioms\n\nAs a result of 60 years of development of the forcing technique, and\nits applications to many open problems in mathematics, there are now\nliterally hundreds of problems and questions, in practically all areas\nof mathematics, that have been shown independent of ZFC. These include\nalmost all important questions about the structure of uncountable\nsets. One might say that the undecidability phenomenon is pervasive,\nto the point that the investigation of the uncountable has been\nrendered nearly impossible in ZFC alone (see however Shelah (1994) for\nremarkable exceptions).\n\nThis prompts the question about the truth-value of the statements that\nare undecided by ZFC. Should one be content with them being\nundecidable? Does it make sense at all to ask for their truth-value?\nThere are several possible reactions to this. One is the\nskeptic\u2019s position: the statements that are undecidable in ZFC\nhave no definite answer; and they may even be inherently vague.\nAnother, the common one among mathematicians, is G\u00f6del\u2019s\nposition: the undecidability only shows that the ZFC system is too\nweak to answer those questions, and therefore one should search for\nnew axioms that once added to ZFC would answer them. The search for\nnew axioms has been known as G\u00f6del\u2019s Program. See\nHauser (2006) for a thorough philosophical discussion of the Program,\nand also the entry on\n large cardinals and determinacy\n for philosophical considerations on the justification of new axioms\nfor set theory.\n\nA central theme of set theory is thus the search and classification of\nnew axioms. These fall currently into two main types: the axioms of\nlarge cardinals and the forcing axioms.\n",
