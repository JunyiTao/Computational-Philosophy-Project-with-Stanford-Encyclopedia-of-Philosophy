    "main_text": "\n\n\nHoles are an interesting case study for ontologists and\nepistemologists. Naive, untutored descriptions of the world treat holes\nas objects of reference, on a par with ordinary material objects.\n(\u2018There are as many holes in the cheese as there are cookies in\nthe tin.\u2019) And we often appeal to holes to account for causal\ninteractions, or to explain the occurrence of certain events.\n(\u2018The water ran out because the bucket has a hole.\u2019)\nHence there is prima facie evidence for the existence of such\nentities. Yet it might be argued that reference to holes is just a\nfa\u00e7on de parler, that holes are mere entia\nrepresentationis, as-if entities, fictions.\n",
