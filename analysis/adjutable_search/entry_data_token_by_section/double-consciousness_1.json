    "main_text": "Double-Consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk\n2. Double-Consciousness in The Souls of Black Folk\n\nThe locus classicus for the Du Boisian conception occurs in\nthe third paragraph of \u201cOf our Spiritual Strivings\u201d, the\nfirst chapter of Du Bois\u2019s 1903 Souls (a slightly\nmodified version of \u201cThe Strivings of the Negro People\u201d,\npublished in The Atlantic Monthly in August, 1897,\nwhere he first uses the term):\n\nAfter the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and\nMongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and\ngifted with second-sight in this American world, \u2013 a world which\nyields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself\nthrough the revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation,\nthis double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one\u2019s\nself through the eyes of others, of measuring one\u2019s soul by the\ntape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever\nfeels his two-ness, \u2013 an American, a Negro; two souls, two\nthoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark\nbody, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.\n(1997 [1903]: 38) [This passage henceforth referred to as the\n\u201cStrivings\u201d text.]\n\n\nAn inspection of the passage reveals the complexity of its object.\nDouble-consciousness is identified as a \u201csensation\u201d, a\nconsciousness of one\u2019s self, but which falls short of a unified,\n\u201ctrue\u201d self-consciousness. It is part of a more complex\nfeeling of \u201ctwo-ness\u201d, of disparate and competing\n\u201cthoughts\u201d, \u201cstrivings\u201d, and\n\u201cideals\u201d. This is not an episodic or occasional sensation,\nbut a persistent form of consciousness. Ascribed to \u201cthe Negro\n\u2026 in this American world\u201d, it is a socio-cultural\nconstruct rather than a baldly bio-racial given, attributed\nspecifically to people of African descent in America. The\n\u201ctwo-ness\u201d of which it is a consciousness thus is not\ninherent, accidental, nor benign: the condition is presented here as\nboth imposed and fraught with psychic danger.\n\nDouble-consciousness is presented in conjunction with two other\nphenomena, related to two other figures \u2013 the\n\u201cveil\u201d, and the \u201cgift\u201d of\n\u201csecond-sight\u201d. Of these, \u201cthe veil\u201d is the\nmore insistent motif, recurring regularly throughout Souls as\nwell as other of Du Bois\u2019s writings. By contrast, the terms\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d and \u201csecond-sight\u201d seem\nnot to have been used in print by Du Bois after 1903. Still, this\npassage has come to have a singular significance in the philosophical\ninterpretation of Du Bois\u2019s thought as well as for the influence\nof his views. Only his oft-repeated claim at the very beginning of\nSouls, that \u201cthe problem of the Twentieth Century is\nthe problem of the color line,\u201d may be more widely known. The\nparagraph immediately following makes clear that, for Du Bois, this is\nnot only a \u201csensation\u201d but constitutes a crucial object of\n\u201cstriving\u201d and political struggle for black folk in the\nUnited States:\n\nThe history of the American Negro is the history of this strife,\n\u2013 this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his\ndouble self into a better and truer self. In this merging he wishes\nneither of the older selves to be lost.\n\n\nThe phenomenon is identified again \u2013 but without being so named\nagain \u2013 in the tenth chapter of Souls, \u201cOf the\nFaith of the Fathers\u201d, an essay on \u201cNegro religious\nlife\u201d. Du Bois writes:\n\nFrom the double life every American Negro must live, as a Negro and as\nan American, as swept on by the current of the nineteenth while yet\nstruggling in the eddies of the fifteenth century, \u2013 from this\nmust arise a painful self-consciousness, an almost morbid sense of\npersonality, and a moral hesitancy which is fatal to self-confidence.\nThe worlds within and without the Veil of Color are changing, and\nchanging rapidly, but not at the same rate, not in the same way; and\nthis must produce a peculiar wrenching of the soul, a peculiar sense\nof doubt and bewilderment. Such a double life, with double thoughts,\ndouble duties, and double social classes, must give rise to double\nwords and double ideals, and tempt the mind to pretence or revolt, to\nhypocrisy or radicalism. (1997 [1903]: 155\u20136) [This passage\nhenceforth referred to as the \u201cFaith\u201d text.]\n\n\nHere double-consciousness, unnamed, is set in a more dynamic context\nthan in the earlier, \u201cStrivings\u201d text. The two passages,\nparallel in form, are subtly different in tone. Here Du Bois clearly\ndistinguishes two social \u201cworlds\u201d and the \u201cdouble\nlives\u201d that result. This text sweeps us along, showing a\ncausality, a coming-into-being of consciousness. And it concludes by\nnoting, in its final twenty words, the social and political\nconsequences of this \u201cpainful\u201d double-consciousness. Yet,\noddly, the \u201cFaith\u201d text is largely neglected in critical\ndiscussions.\n\nThe current relevance of double consciousness to an understanding of\nBlack lives, and of contemporary American reality, is debated in\nrecent commentary and scholarship. In an interview, the late Toni\nMorrison recalled the Du Boisian motif in characterizing the\nliterary work of Black men:\n\n\u2026 African American male writers justifiably write books about\ntheir oppression,\n\n\nshe says.\n\nConfronting the oppressor who is white male or white woman. It\u2019s\nrace. And the person who defines you under those circumstances is a\nwhite mind \u2013 tells you whether you\u2019re worthy or what have\nyou. And as long as that\u2019s your preoccupation, you\u2019re\ndefending yourself against that. Reacting to it. Reacting to the\ndefinition \u2013 saying it\u2019s not true.\n\n\nMorrison contrasts this to her own approach, which is to \u201ctake\naway the gaze of the white male. Once you take that out, the whole\nworld opens up\u201d. (Morrison 2012)\n\nAlso, the New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow has more\nthan once cited the \u201cStrivings\u201d text in commenting on the\ncontemporary paradoxes of black life brought into the open by some of\nPresident Obama\u2019s public statements in the wake of recent\ncriminal justice controversies (Blow 2013).\n\nA number of academic writers have worked to contextualize and\ninterpret Du Bois\u2019s notion of double-consciousness \u2013 most\noften focusing on the \u201cStrivings\u201d text, and neglecting the\n\u201cFaith\u201d text \u2013 to identify sources and antecedents\nthat influenced his conception, and to clarify the concerns he was\naddressing and his intentions in putting it forward. A brief resume of\nthat interpretive record follows.\n",
