    "main_text": "Physics\n3. Physics\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Intimations, Paths and Havens,\nOpposites and Flashes of Light all contain sections\non physics, although they have remained unstudied. Of those, only the\nphysics of the Flashes of Light (2001, 185\u2013209; 1991\n[Najafquli ed.]) and of Intimations have been edited, the\nlatter together with a commentary by Ibn Kammuna (2003). In the third\ndiscourse of the Philosophy of Illumination, and in Paths\nand Havens (though not in Flashes of Light or\nIntimations), Suhrawardi reviews some general principles of\nphysics (albeit not in detail). Like Avicenna before him, he rejects\nthe atomism of the theologians (PI, \u00a789), as well as the\nidea of a vacuum (PI, \u00a7\u00a789\u201390). He also\ncriticizes and rejects (Aristotelian) Peripatetic hylomorphic division\nof bodies into matter and form, rejecting the notion of prime matter.\nShurawardi provides a number of arguments for his rejection of\nhylomorphism (PI, \u00a772\u201388). One of them relies on\nhis theory of bodies that now consist of \u201cself-subsistent\nmagnitude with accidents\u201d (Walbridge 2017, 266\u20137), a\n\u201ccompound of extension and properties just as Simplicius\u201d.\nIn addition, he needed \u201cthat accidents be able to constitute\ncauses, for it is the causality of accidents that makes it possible to\nexplain the existence of the Platonic Forms and ultimately to explain\nthe diversity of the celestial and sublunary reals\u201d. Moreover,\nhe held that \u201centities that cannot be perceived either by\nphysical senses or by nonsensible intuition\u201d, for example\n\u2018forms\u2019, \u201ccannot be known, and if they exist, it is\nonly as mental constructs\u201d. These are important critiques and\nreformulations of physics to assist him in his reformulation of his\nmetaphysics. Bodies become \u2018barriers\u2019 or \u201cthings\nthat acquire properties from the lights\u201d that differ in\n\u2018intensity\u2019 (Walbridge, 2005, 240\u2013242). Hylomorphism\nbecomes incompatible with the possibility of knowing real essences,\nthe \u2018ontic\u2019 luminous essence, of all entities, that of\nimmaterial lights and of \u2019s own self, which cannot be known via\na postulated \u2018form\u2019 (Ziai 1990, 131, 151\u20132). The\ndetermination of different bodies now \u201cdepends on the\nmulti-aspect movement and internal relationships of strong and weak\nlights\u201d, intensity becoming the ontological discriminating\ncriterion (Arslan 2014, 150; PI, \u00a774). \n\nWith his philosophy of lights, he manages, nonetheless, to reconfigure\nsome elements of physics. For instance, immaterial entities and\nmaterial bodies are composed of varying degrees of intensity of light.\nThe physical world is composed of dusky substances with dark\naccidents, while self-subsistent magnitude appears to replace prime\nmatter which, like a number of traditional physical notions, becomes a\nmere mental concept that has no reality outside the mind. It is no\nlonger the perception of the form of objects, but their constitutive\nlights that becomes the true object of knowledge (Walbridge 2000,\n22\u20133). \n",
