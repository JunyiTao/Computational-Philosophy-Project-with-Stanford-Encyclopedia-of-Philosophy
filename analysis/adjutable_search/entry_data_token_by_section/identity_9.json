    "main_text": "Vague identity\n10. Are there philosophical problems about identity?\n\nFinally in this entry we return briefly to the idea mentioned in the\nintroduction that although the debates about identity make sense they\ncannot genuinely be debates about identity, since there are no\nphilosophical problems about identity. This view has recently been\nreceiving increasing attention. Lewis is the most cited defender\nof this view. In the context of discussing the putative\n\u201cproblem\u201d of trans-world identity he says:\n\n[W]e should not suppose that we have here any problem about\nidentity. We never have. Identity is utterly simple and\nunproblematic. Everything is identical to itself; nothing is ever\nidentical to anything except itself. There is never any problem about\nwhat makes something identical to itself; nothing can ever fail to\nbe. (Lewis 1986: 192\u201393)\n\nLewis\u2019s argument here might be expanded as\nfollows: Consider any putative problem about the conditions under\nwhich a thing x is identical with a thing y. There\nare only two cases: either (i) x is identical with\ny, or (ii) x is not identical with y.\nConsider case (i). In this case the putative problem is about the\nconditions under which x is identical with itself. But there\ncannot be any such problem, because it is a conceptual truth that\neverything is identical with itself, and so x is identical\nwith itself under all conditions. To ask for the conditions under\nwhich something is identical with itself is like asking \u2018Under\nwhat conditions is one thing one thing, and not two things?\u2019\nThere can be no informative answer because necessarily, if something\nis one thing then it is one thing, and not two things, and nothing\nmore can be said. Now consider case (ii). The putative problem is now\nabout the conditions under which a thing x is identical with\na different thing y. But there cannot be any such problem,\nbecause it is a conceptual truth that one thing and a different thing\nare not identical, and so there are no conditions under which\nx and y are identical. To ask for the conditions\nunder which one thing and a different thing are identical is like\nasking \u2018Under what conditions are two things one thing, and not\ntwo things?\u2019 There can be no informative answer because\nnecessarily, if two things are two things, then they are two things,\nand not one thing, and nothing more can be said. And so, whether case\n(i) or case (ii) holds, there can be no problem about the conditions\nunder which a thing x is identical with a thing\ny.\n\nThe argument seems persuasive, but anyone who accepts it is committed\nto it being possible to state problems that seem to be about\nidentity (such as the \u201cproblem\u201d of trans-world identity)\nin terms that make it clear that such problems are not in fact about\nidentity. Furthermore, it seems that we do very often use the\nconcept of identity, and an explanation of how and why we use it\nso often seems to be required if the argument above is sound.\n\nMost seem to have accepted Lewis\u2019s view (see, e.g., Akiba\n2000, Hawthorne 2003, Noonan 2007, Noonan and Curtis 2018), but\nthere are some who dissent (Gallois 2005, Shumener 2020, Azzano\nand Carrara 2021). The question of how and why we use the concept of\nidentity was a central concern of Wittgenstein (see Fogelin 1983 for\nan overview), and has recently received attention from others (Burgess\n2018).\n",
