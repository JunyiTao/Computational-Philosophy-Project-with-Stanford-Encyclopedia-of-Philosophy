    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues of Secession || Constitutional theorizing about secession\n1.2 Constitutional theorizing about secession\n\n\nSome philosophers have distinguished between the question of whether\nand, if so, under what conditions a group has a moral claim-right to\nsecede and the question of whether and, if so, under what conditions a\nconstitution ought to or may permissibly include a right to secede. For\nexample, while acknowledging that secession may sometimes be morally\njustified (where this presumably means the group in question has the\nclaim-right to secede), Cass Sunstein has argued that constitutional\nrecognition of a right to secede is incompatible with the principles of\nconstitutionalism (or at least democratic\n constitutionalism)[2]\n (Sunstein 1991). Sunstein argues\nthat a basic principle of constitutionalism is that political\ninstitutions, including the constitution itself, must be designed to\nencourage citizens to engage in the hard work of democratic politics,\nwhere this means competing in the public forum on grounds of principle,\nwith a minimum of strategic bargaining. Following Albert O. Hirschman\n(1970), he then contends that if the constitution acknowledges a right\nto secede, then discontent minorities will be tempted to shirk the hard\nwork of principled, democratic politics either by seceding when the\nmajoritarian decisions go against their preferences or by using the\nthreat of secession as a strategic bargaining tool as a de facto veto\nover majority rule. In either case, democracy will be undermined.\n\n\nHowever, as Buchanan has argued (1991: 132), Sunstein fails even to\nconsider the possibility that a constitution could so hedge the right\nto secede as to reduce the threat of exit by minorities to acceptable\nproportions. The analogy here is with the right of constitutional\namendment as found in the United States Constitution. This right is\nsignificantly hedged: two super-majorities, one in the Congress, the\nother among the States, are required for amendment. Similarly, an\nappropriately hedged right to secede is not incompatible with the\nprinciples of constitutionalism: well-designed procedural hurdles\n(super-majorities, waiting periods, etc.) can make secession\nsufficiently difficult as to avoid an unacceptable risk of premature\nexit or strategic bargaining by minorities, while still making\nsecession possible under appropriate conditions. The current Ethiopian\nConstitution in fact includes such a hedged right to secede, requiring\nnot only two super-majorities in favor of secession, but also a waiting\nperiod. So, although appropriate constitutional design regarding\nsecession must cope with the risks that secession will impair\ndemocratic processes, constitutional recognition of a right to secede\ndoes not appear to be incompatible with constitutionalism.\n\n\nWayne Norman goes further, arguing that there are significant\nadvantages to constitutionalizing conflicts over secession (Norman\n2003). The Supreme Court of Canada recently took the same position,\narguing that the potentially disruptive process of secession by Quebec\ncan be subjected to the rule of law by a process of negotiation and\nconstitutional \n amendment.[3]\n\n\nThere is yet another argument for including a right to secede in a\nconstitution. In some cases, when a new political entity is being\ncreated out of two or more independent or semi-autonomous entities,\nincluding a right to exit in the constitution of the new entity may be\nnecessary as an inducement to join the new union. Under conditions of\nuncertainty as to how the new union will work, constitutional\nrecognition of a \u201cbail out\u201d option may be necessary to get\nthe new union going \n (Buchanan 1991: ch. 4).[4]\n\n\nThere is much philosophical work to be done on the question of when\nand, if so, how the right to secede might be constitutionalized. It\nwill require both an account of the principles of constitutionalism and\nof the morality of secession and an empirically based knowledge of the\nconditions under which various constitutional arrangements can be\nreasonably expected to realize the principles of constitutionalism in a\nmanner that is consistent with secession.\n",
