In a\ndiscussion led by an unnamed person, a philosopher visiting Athens\nfrom Elea, political expertise (harking back to the politik\u00ea\ntechn\u00ea met above with Socrates, sect. 3.1) is identified by\nseparating it progressively by a set of distinctions from other forms\nof expertise. The discussion is interrupted but ultimately enriched by\na story or myth in which politics is shown to be a matter of humans\nruling other humans in place of living under divine guidance\n(O\u2019Meara 2020). That human expertise of statecraft is ultimately\ndistinguished by its knowledge of the correct timing (kairos)\nas to when its closest rivals should be exercised: these are three\nforms of expertise that in fact corresponded to key political roles,\nsome of them formal offices, in Greek cities at the time, namely,\nrhetoric, generalship, and judging (Lane 1998, Lane 2013c). The\nstatesman is wholly defined by the possession of that knowledge of\nwhen it is best to exercise these and the other subordinate forms of\nexpertise, and by the role of exercising that knowledge in binding or\nweaving the different groups of citizens together, a knowledge which\ndepends on a broader philosophical grasp but which is peculiarly\npolitical (El Murr 2014). Here, political philosophy operates not just\nto assimilate politics to a broader metaphysical horizon but also to\nidentify its specificity.\n\nThe Statesman also raises an important question about the\nnature and value of rule by law, as opposed to rule by such expert\nknowledge as embodied in a rare and likely singular individual. For\nits part, the Republic had taken law in its stride as the\nstandard formulation to be utilized in the construction of the city in\nspeech by the dialogue\u2019s principal interlocutors from Book II\nonward, who constitute themselves as the ideal constitution\u2019s\n\u2018founders\u2019 (Annas 2017, Lane 2013a). By contrast, the\nStatesman analyzes law as in principle a stubborn and\nimperfect substitute for the flexible deployment of expertise\n(293e\u2013303c). However, the principal interlocutors of the latter\ndialogue go on to agree that if the choice is between an ignorant\nimitator of the true political expert who changes the laws on the\nbasis of whim, and a law-bound polity, the latter would be preferable,\nso bringing law back into the picture as an alternative to the ideal\nafter all.\n",
