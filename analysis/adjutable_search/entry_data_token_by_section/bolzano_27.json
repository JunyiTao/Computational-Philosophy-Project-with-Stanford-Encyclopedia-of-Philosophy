    "main_text": "Philosophy of Nature and of Physics\n10. Philosophy of Nature and of Physics\n\nIt is but a small step from some of Bolzano\u2019s rather traditional\nmetaphysical views into the realm of the philosophy of nature and of\nphysics. Bolzano introduces a force of attraction among substances\n(Bolzano 1827, 48) and later also a force of repulsion (Bolzano 1851,\nreprint 1975: 121, 123 f., E: Russ 2004, 671 f., 673). For the force\nof attraction Bolzano attempts to prove the Newtonian law that it is\ninversely proportional to the square of the distance (Bolzano 1827,\n50, Bolzano 1851, reprint 1975: 121 f., E: Russ 2004, 671 f.), and\nfurther that the force of attraction of two substances is related\nproportionally to the set (i.e., presumably, to the product of the\nnumbers) of atoms contained in these substances.\n\nStarting from these metaphysical questions concerning the foundations\nof physics, Bolzano then occupied himself in several works also with\nconcrete questions in natural science (e.g. in Bolzano 1842,\n1843c, and 1851), and in particular with physical and\nastronomical questions. Although he was not able to aim at\nnew and enduring results in these areas, his writings nonetheless show\nthat he was also seriously occupied with such questions and could be\n\u201cconversant\u201d in the status of these disciplines during his\nday. To be mentioned here are especially his work on the composition\nof forces (Bolzano 1842) and two essays in the Annals of Physics\nand Chemistry, in which he was concerned with the writings and\ntheories of Christian Doppler (Bolzano 1843a and 1847). A summary of\nBolzano\u2019s contributions to the philosophy of nature and to\nphysics can be found in Berg 2003.\n",
