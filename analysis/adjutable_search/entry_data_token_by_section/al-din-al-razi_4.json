    "main_text": "Psychology\n5. Psychology\n\nA fundamental assumption of Aristotelian psychology is that the souls\nof all living things are characterized by a range of\n\u201cpowers\u201d or \u201cfaculties\u201d (Greek\ndunameis, Arabic quwan). These powers account for\nthe distinction between plants, animals, and humans: plants have the\n\u201cvegetative\u201d powers of nutrition, growth, and\nreproduction; animals the powers of sensation, locomotion, and\nimagination; humans alone (among embodied beings) have the power of\nreason or intellect. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 made significant alterations\nto this scheme, not least by introducing a theory of \u201cinternal\nsenses\u201d to account for cognitive capacities lying between\nsensation and full-blown intellection. But broadly speaking, he\nadhered to the tradition of faculty psychology. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn\u2019s earlier contemporary Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t\nal-Baghd\u0101d\u012b rejected this whole approach. For him the soul\nis a unity and is the single subject of all cognition (Kaukua\n2016).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn agrees, and in several of his works offers arguments\nintended to confirm Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t\u2019s thesis. The most\npowerful of these is that the soul is capable of what we might call\n\u201chybrid judgments\u201d. These are modeled on the sort of case\nconsidered already by Aristotle, that honey is both white and sweet:\nhere vision and taste might seem to be making a judgment about the\nsame object, suggesting that they belong to a single subject, which\ncould be the entire soul. Such is Aristotle\u2019s commitment to\nfaculty psychology, though, that he instead introduces a new power\nwithin the soul (the \u201ccommon sense\u201d) to take\nresponsibility for judgments that involve more than one sense\nmodality. Or at least, this is how he was understood in the later\ntradition.\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn argues, however, that the same pattern repeats\nacross all the faculties. For example, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 had drawn a\nstrict contrast between the human intellect and the lower cognitive\nfaculties, on the grounds that the former grasps universals while the\nlatter powers\u2014from sensation to imagination and\nmemory\u2014deal only with particulars. But, says Fakhr al-D\u012bn,\nwe are able to apply a universal to a particular (\u201cZayd is\nhuman\u201d). It must be the unified soul that is responsible for\nsuch judgments:\n\n\nWhen we perceive a particular individual human, we know that he is a\nparticular belonging to the universal \u201chuman\u201d and not a\nparticular belonging to the universal \u201chorse\u201d. That which\njudges a particular man to be a particular belonging to the universal\n\u201chuman\u201d and not a particular belonging to the universal\n\u201chorse\u201d, must inevitably be perceptive of the particular\nman, the universal \u201chuman\u201d, and the universal\n\u201chorse\u201d. And so that which perceives particulars is also\nthat which perceives universals (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith vol.2,\n255; 345\u20136; Shar\u1e25 al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t vol.2,\n265\u20137; the unity of the soul is discussed in depth at\nMa\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.7, 159ff).\n\n\nAnother point, which again is taken over from Ab\u016b\nl-Baghd\u0101d\u012b, is that the human soul at least has a kind of\n\u201cfirst person perspective\u201d on its cognitive actions. It is\ncapable of grasping itself directly\u2014as argued by Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 himself in his famous \u201cflying man\u201d\nargument\u2014and of grasping itself as the subject of all its\ncognitions. Note that, since these arguments all turn on active\ncognition, Fakhr al-D\u012bn is willing to exempt the non-cognitive\nvegetative powers from this unified soul (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith\nvol.2, 256\u20137). But there is no division of powers distinguishing\nthe \u201canimal soul\u201d from the rational soul that is\ndistinctive of humans.\n\nThis does not stop Fakhr al-D\u012bn from using Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s method for proving that the human soul is an\nimmaterial substance (Adamson 2021b, Alpina 2021). Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof inferred the rational soul\u2019s nature\nfrom the nature of its objects: since it grasps indivisible\nintelligible forms, it must itself be indivisible, and therefore not a\nbody. In this case Fakhr al-D\u012bn chooses not to refute the\nAvicennan line of argument but to improve upon it, by adding further\narguments to show that intelligibles are indeed indivisible\n(Mab\u0101\u1e25ith vol.2, 362\u20135, also\nShar\u1e25 vol.2, 285\u20138). He does still worry that the\nargument is incomplete: the rational soul could be indivisible but not\nimmaterial if it were an atom (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.7, 62),\nso the cogency of the argument will depend on showing that atomism is\nincoherent (see above, Section 3). And even if we reject atomism,\nAvicennan prime matter is arguably also indivisible\n(Shar\u1e25 vol.2, 295). Still Fakhr al-D\u012bn seems to be\nat least well-disposed towards the idea that the soul\u2019s ability\nto grasp intelligibles establishes its immateriality.\n\nSince this ability belongs to the entire, unified soul and not is just\none \u201cfaculty\u201d that could exist on its own as a disembodied\nmind, this should secure immateriality, and hence the prospect of\nimmortality, for the human soul. When he speaks about the nature of\nthe human soul, he sometimes says that it is a luminous substance that\nfuses with the body like rosewater in rose petals or oil in sesame,\nwhich seems to make it a kind of very subtle body but not, he says,\nlike those perceptible to the senses (for passages see Jaffer 2015:\n192). But it other contexts, Fakhr al-D\u012bn seems to be ready to\nembrace full-fledged substance dualism. For this conclusion he\ntypically uses argumentation based on introspection, such as his\nversion of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s Flying Man argument, or the\nimmediate awareness of personal identity over time (see, e.g.,\nMa\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.7, 101; 105).\n\nWhat about animal souls? The arguments presented so far clearly blur\nthe sharp distinction that Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and other\nfal\u0101sifa drew between human and animal souls. But Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn goes further. In both his Mulakhkha\u1e63 and\nhis Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib he suggests that non-human animals\nhave intelligence that is not different in kind from human rationality\n(Adamson & Somma forthcoming, Virgi 2022). Animals are self-aware,\nknow that they persist through time, grasp universals, and can make\nplans and solve problems. This does not necessarily mean that animals\nare equal to humans in their intelligence. Rather there may be a\ncontinuum of cognitive capacities, with some animals ranged further\naway from humans, others closer to them. But\n\n\nif what is meant by \u201creason\u201d is any of the types of\nintelligence, then this intelligence should be attributed to\n[non-human] animals. (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.7, 311)\n\n\nHe may have found this view plausible in part because, again following\nAb\u016b l-Barak\u0101t, he is open to the idea that even just within\nthe human \u201cspecies\u201d we have differences that amount to\ndistinctions in quiddity (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.7, 141). So\nfrom this point of view too, there is little reason to embrace a stark\nopposition between human and non-human animal nature.\n",
