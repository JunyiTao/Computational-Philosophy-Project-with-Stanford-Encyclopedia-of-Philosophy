    "main_text": "The Theoretical Landscape of SM\n2. The Theoretical Landscape of SM\n\nPhilosophical discussions in SM face an immediate difficulty.\nPhilosophical projects in many areas of physics can take an accepted\ntheory and its formalism as their point of departure. Philosophical\ndiscussions of quantum mechanics, for instance, can begin with the\nHilbert space formulation of the theory and develop their arguments\nwith reference to it. The situation in SM is different. Unlike\ntheories such as quantum mechanics, SM has not yet found a generally\naccepted theoretical framework or a canonical formalism. What we\nencounter in SM is a plurality of different approaches and schools of\nthought, each with its own mathematical apparatus and foundational\nassumptions. For this reason, a review of the philosophy of SM cannot\nsimply start with a statement of the theory\u2019s basic principles\nand then move on to different interpretations of the theory. Our task\nis to first classify different approaches and then discuss how each\nworks; a further question then concerns the relation between them.\n\nClassifying and labelling approaches raises its own issues, and\ndifferent routes are possible. However, SM\u2019s theoretical\nplurality notwithstanding, most of the approaches one finds in it can\nbe brought under one of three broad theoretical umbrellas. These are\nknown as \u201cBoltzmannian SM\u201d (BSM), the \u201cBoltzmann\nEquation\u201d (BE), and \u201cGibbsian SM\u201d (GSM). The label\n\u201cBSM\u201d is somewhat unfortunate because it might suggest\nthat Boltzmann, only (or primarily) championed this particular\napproach, whereas he has in fact contributed to the development of\nmany different theoretical positions (for an overview of his\ncontributions to SM see the entry on\n Boltzmann\u2019s work in statistical physics;\n for detailed discussions see Cercignani (1998), Darrigol (2018), and\nUffink (2007)). These labels have, however, become customary and so we\nstick with \u201cBSM\u201d despite its historical infelicity. We\nwill now discuss the theoretical backdrop against which these\npositions are formulated, namely dynamical systems, and then introduce\nthe positions in\n \u00a74,\n \u00a75, and\n \u00a76,\n respectively. Extensive synoptic discussion of SM can also be found\nin Frigg (2008b), Shenker (2017a, 2017b), Sklar (1993), and Uffink\n(2007).\n",
