In\ntandem, scholars consider this discussion to be central to\nKant\u2019s so-called critical philosophy. Given Kant\u2019s\nreputation for developing difficult, not to say obscure, philosophical\nviews, it will also not surprise the reader to learn that there is no\nconsensus on how Kant\u2019s conception of space and time ought to be\ncharacterized and explicated. So the goal of this entry is to bring\nsome clarity to Kant\u2019s views by situating them historically and\nphilosophically within the milieu of some central debates concerning\nspace and time in the early modern period, especially the rich century\nbetween the first edition of Newton\u2019s Principia\nmathematica, which was first published in 1687, and the\npublication of the second edition of the Critique of Pure\nReason exactly a hundred years later. The difficulty of\ncomprehending Kant\u2019s views gives interpreters a reason to place\na special emphasis on context\u2014I will especially highlight\nKant\u2019s reactions to his most significant predecessors in this\narea, Leibniz and Newton. The focus throughout will be on Kant\u2019s\nmagnum opus, the Critique of Pure Reason. Following\ntradition, and to some extent Kant\u2019s own lead, the focus will\nalso be on space and on our representation of space, although parallel\npoints concerning time (and its representation) will sometimes be\nindicated.\n\nIn what follows, the Critique of Pure Reason is cited by the\nusual A/B method; other references are to Kants gesammelte\nSchriften (via \u201cAk\u201d [for Akademie edition] followed\nby volume and page number).

Introduction: philosophical questions about space and time\n\nIn the context of interpreting Kant\u2019s views concerning space and\ntime, a number of philosophical questions are relevant. Kant himself\nprovides a litany of these questions in his so-called Inaugural\nDissertation of 1770, a text in which he broke with his previous\nbroadly \u201cLeibnizian\u201d views from the pre-critical period\n(Hatfield 2006, 72\u20136). He writes:\n\nSpace is not something objective and real, nor a substance, nor an\naccident, nor a relation; instead, it is subjective and ideal, and\noriginates from the mind\u2019s nature in accord with a stable law as\na scheme, as it were, for coordinating everything sensed externally.\n(Ak 2: 403)\n\n\nIn this one pithy sentence, we find a list of many important early\nmodern questions concerning space. Is space \u201creal,\u201d or is\nit \u201cideal\u201d in some sense? Is it a substance in its own\nright, a property of some substance, or perhaps neither? Is it somehow\ndependent on the relations among objects, or independent of those\nrelations? What is the relationship between space and the mind? And\nfinally, how do these various issues intersect with one another?\n\nThe passage from the Inaugural Dissertation hints at five\ndistinct questions or issues concerning space and time. First, there\nis the question of the ontology of space and time considered within\nthe framework of what Kant would regard as the dogmatic metaphysics of\nthe seventeenth century. This framework might suggest that if space\nand time are to exist, or to characterize the physical world, they\nmust be considered either substances in their own right, or else\nproperties of some substance. Neither option seems particularly\nattractive. Space and time seem distinct from substances because they\nare causally inert, causally inaccessible\u2014their aspects or\nproperties cannot be altered by interacting with any other\nsubstance\u2014and imperceptible. Since they are often regarded as\ninfinite, moreover, some thinkers have doubted that they could be\nsubstances, as God is often thought of as the sole infinite substance\n(Descartes may have conceived of space as \u201cindefinite\u201d for\nthis reason). However, it is also difficult to think of space and time\nas properties of any substance, for then they would presumably be\ndependent on that substance for their existence. If we regard them as\ndependent on any contingent substance, it seems that we would be\ncommitted to the idea that space and time could fail to exist, or\ncould disappear, depending on the happenings of that contingent\nsubstance. One might think instead that space and time depend on the\none necessary substance, but this obviously raises a host of other\nissues. To think of space and time as properties of God is potentially\nto regard God as spatiotemporal, which is verboten from the\npoint of view of many seventeenth-century thinkers (Janiak 2008,\nchapter five).\n\nA second topic arises if we consider the ontology of space and time\nindependently from the substance-property metaphysical framework,\ne.g. by considering the relationship of space and time to\nphysical objects. Following Newton\u2019s discussion in the first\n(1687) edition of the Scholium following the Definitions in the\nPrincipia, the modern debate concerning space\u2019s\nontology has been centered on two overarching conceptions: absolutism\n(now sometimes called \u201csubstantivalism,\u201d although that\nlabel raises certain issues), the view that space and time exist\nindependently of all possible objects and object relations, or perhaps\nthe view that space-time points exist; and relationalism, the view\nthat space and time depend for their existence on possible objects and\nrelations, or perhaps the view that space-time points do not exist\n(DiSalle 2006; Messina 2018).\n\nLeaving aside questions about ontology, there is a distinct\u2014or\nat least potentially distinct\u2014issue regarding space and time:\nwhat is the origin of our representation of space and of time? This\nthird issue arises from the sense in the early modern period that our\nidea or representation of space and time must somehow be importantly\ndistinct from our idea or representation of ordinary physical objects.\nMany believed that space and time are causally inert and therefore\nimperceptible\u2014how then are we are able to represent space and\ntime at all? Few are willing to deny that we have a representation,\nnot merely of spatial and of temporal objects, but also of space and\ntime themselves, so there is a genuine puzzle lurking here.\n\nThe fourth topic follows on the heels of the third: what is the\ncontent of our idea or representation of space and time? From\nKant\u2019s point of view, the content of a representation might\nprovide us with a guide to its possible origin. Alternatively, we\nmight be able to consider the origin of a representation as providing\nus with a clue as to what its content might be. In the case of space,\nthere may be reason to think that the content of our representation\nmust somehow reflect what we know about space from Euclidean\ngeometry.\n\nThe fifth and potentially final topic is closely connected with the\nthird and fourth, and indeed, connects all four previous topics with\none another: what is the relationship between space and time, on the\none hand, and the human mind, on the other? This question obviously\ncries out for clarification. Part of what this question might mean can\nbe characterized by the third and fourth questions above: if we think\nof the mind as representing space and time in a certain way, then\nperhaps this is part of our understanding of the mind\u2019s\nrelationship with space and time themselves. But within the context of\nKant\u2019s work, there is, at least prima facie, another\nissue lurking here\u2014are space and time somehow dependent upon the\nmind for their existence? It may be that some kind of dependence is\nsuggested by the origin\u2014or by the content\u2014of our\nrepresentation of space and time (or perhaps by these two jointly).\nBut Kant also seems to think that a view recognizing the dependence of\nspace and time on the mind might offer advantages in addressing the\nontological problems mentioned above.\n\nEach of these five philosophical issues concerning space and time is\nrelevant for understanding Kant\u2019s views. As we will see below,\npart of the difficulty in interpreting Kant arises from the fact that\nhe evidently transforms various aspects of the early modern debates\nconcerning space and time through the perspective presented in the\nfirst Critique (Allison 2004, 120\u20131). Within the context of\nthe first issue raised above, the view that space and time are\nreal may mean that space and time are substances in their own\nright, rather than merely properties; yet within the context of the\nabsolutism-relationalism debate, if space and time are real,\nthey exist independently of all objects and relations. But Kant uses\nthe terms real and ideal to express views concerning\nthe relation between space and time and the mind, leaving aside any\nviews concerning objects and relations. This entry aims to clarify\nmatters by separating these various considerations.\n2. The background to Kant\u2019s views in the Critique\n2.1 Leibniz and Newton\n\nThere is no doubt that the debate between the Leibnizians and the\nNewtonians concerning the status of space and time forms part of the\nessential background to Kant\u2019s views throughout his career.\nAlthough Newton originally formulated his conception of space and time\nin response to Descartes\u2019s views in the Principles of\nPhilosophy (1644), by the turn of the eighteenth century, Newton\nand his followers were embroiled in an extensive debate with Leibniz\nand his supporters on the Continent. This reflected, in part, the\nfamous priority dispute regarding the calculus, but it also reflected\nsome of Leibniz\u2019s fundamental criticisms of Newton\u2019s views\nof space, time and motion in Principia mathematica (1687,\n1713\u2014second edition). Leibniz raised many of those criticisms in\nhis correspondence with Samuel Clarke, who defended Newton\u2019s\nideas. Kant mentions this debate frequently in the\nCritique (see, e.g., A23/B37, A39/B56, & A46/B64).\nBroadly speaking, Newton and his followers argued for the importance\nof thinking of space, time and motion as \u201cabsolute\u201d or at least from\nan absolute point of view. This means that one regards space and time\nas existing independently of matter and relations amongst material\nbodies. As Newton (1999, 408) puts it, \u201cAbsolute space, of its own\nnature without reference to anything external, always remains\nhomogeneous and immovable.\u201d So absolute space, or space regarded from\nan absolute point of view, has a nature and has the properties of\nhomogeneity and immovability independently of anything else. Since\nspace on this conception has a nature and has properties independently\nof any relations, Newton was often interpreted as saying that space is\na being or perhaps a substance. To the chagrin of many philosophers,\nNewton avoided using these categories in the Principia\nitself, although in a famous unpublished manuscript he denied that one\nshould think of space as either a substance or as an\naccident (Newton 2014, 35\u201336). In his correspondence with Clarke\n(1715\u20131716), Leibniz then argued that Newton\u2019s conception of\nspace and time conflicts with the principle of sufficient reason: if\nspace were to exist independently of all matter and material\nrelations, then there could be no reason for God to have chosen to\ncreate matter in one location rather than any other; independently of\nmatter, all locations are indistinguishable (see L 5: 3\u20134). In part to\nsolve this problem involving the principle of sufficient reason,\nLeibniz then argues that space is merely the order of relations\namongst material bodies. So on his view, space depends on objects and\ntheir relations, which solves the problem: since space does not exist\nindependently of matter, God never faced the question of \u201cwhere\u201d to\nplace bodies in space. To create a bunch of matter just is to create\nspace.\n\nMany interpreters have thought that in the Critique of Pure\nReason, and particularly in its first section, the Transcendental\nAesthetic, Kant attempts to engage the Leibnizian\n\u201crelationalist\u201d and the Newtonian \u201cabsolutist\u201d\nconceptions of space with transcendental\n idealism.[1]\n As Charles Parsons puts it, \u201cthe issue between what are now\ncalled absolutist and relationalist conceptions of space and time,\nrepresented paradigmatically by Newton and Leibniz\u201d represents\n\u201cthe background to all of [Kant\u2019s] thinking\u201d about\nspace and time (Parsons 1992, 67; cf. Torretti 1999, 105). In the\nbeginning of the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant frames his view by\ncontrasting it with the failures of the Leibnizians and the Newtonians\nto conceive of space appropriately:\n\nNow what are space and time? Are they actual entities [wirkliche\nWesen]? Are they only determinations or also relations of things, but\nstill such as would belong to them even if they were not intuited? Or\nare they such that they belong only to the form of intuition, and\ntherefore to the subjective constitution of our mind, without which\nthese predicates could not be ascribed to any things at all?\n(A23/B37\u20138).\n\n\nThe view that space and time are actual entities is meant to represent\nthe Newtonian position, and the view that they are determinations or\nrelations of things, the Leibnizian position (but cf. Hatfield 2006,\n77\u20138). Later in the Transcendental Aesthetic, he refers to the\nNewtonians as the \u201cmathematical investigators\u201d of nature,\nwho contend that space and time \u201csubsist\u201d on their own,\nand to the Leibnizians as the \u201cmetaphysicians of nature,\u201d\nwho think that space and time \u201cinhere\u201d in objects and\ntheir relations (see A39\u201340/B56\u201357).\n\nWhile Kant does clearly allude to this theoretical background, it is\nnoteworthy that views of the sort he defends in the\nAesthetic\u2014that space and time are transcendentally ideal, that\nthey are mere \u201cforms\u201d of intuition, that they depend upon\nthe \u201csubjective constitution of the mind,\u201d and so\non\u2014do not obviously make contact with the Leibniz/Newton debate.\nThis raises questions about Kant\u2019s use of the Leibniz-Newton\nbackground. First, how does Kant understand the Leibnizian and the\nNewtonian conceptions of space and time? Does he think of them solely\nas views on what I have called the status of space vis-\u00e0-vis\nobjects and relations, or does he think that they contain, or perhaps\nentail, views on other topics, such as the character of our\nrepresentations of space and time? Does Kant regard himself as needing\nto undermine either, or both, of these prior conceptions in order to\nsupport his conclusion that space and time are transcendentally ideal?\nDoes Kant\u2019s rejection of both the Leibnizian and the\nNewtonian conceptions as types of \u201ctranscendental realism\u201d\nilluminate what he means by transcendental idealism? And finally, is\nKant on secure ground in characterizing his predecessors\u2019 views\nin this way? These questions will help to guide the discussion\nbelow.\n\nThe fact that Kant focuses on the debate between the Leibnizians and\nthe Newtonians is perplexing given his evident lack of interest,\nwithin the context of the Critique, in problems concerning\nmotion. One of Newton\u2019s principal reasons for distinguishing\nbetween an \u201cabsolute\u201d (or \u201cmathematical\u201d) and\na \u201crelative\u201d (or \u201ccommon\u201d) conception of space\nis to ground a distinction between true and merely relative motion.\nNewton construes the true motion of an object, as opposed to its\nmerely \u201capparent\u201d motion, not in terms of its change in\nrelations to other objects, as Descartes had done in his\nPrinciples, but in terms of its change of absolute place\n(Janiak 2008, chapter five). So the very idea of absolute or\nmathematical space helps to express what true motion is. Discovering\nthe true, as opposed to the merely apparent, motions of objects, so\nthat one can then determine the forces that cause these true motions,\nrepresents one of the principal goals of Newton\u2019s\nPrincipia.\n\nKant is perfectly well aware of these details from the Scholium to the\nPrincipia, but he makes it clear in the Transcendental\nAesthetic that he wishes to bracket questions concerning the motion of\nobjects. The reason is that he regards <motion> as an\nempirical concept, and the Aesthetic aims to articulate a purely a\npriori conception of space (see A 41/B 58; also MFNS, 4: 482).\nInstead, Kant tackles physical motion in the Metaphysical\nFoundations, where he contends that one can distinguish true from\nrelative motion by determining the center of mass frame of the solar\nsystem (4: 482, 487, 555\u20136, 559\u201363), thereby avoiding the postulation\nof Newton\u2019s mathematical (absolute) space.\n\nBut what if we abstract away from questions of physical motion? What\nif we consider motion within a much more abstract context: for\ninstance, can the motion of a mathematical point through\nspace be considered in the Aesthetic? Kant makes it clear that this\nremains empirical because the concept of motion itself is empirical,\nand so should still be deferred to the Metaphysical\nFoundations. Indeed, the latter begins with a consideration of\nmotion in abstraction from various physical questions like the mass of\nthe objects and then slowly progresses by adding further physical (or\nempirical) elements.\n\nKant does discuss the important notion of the \u201cmotion of the\nsubject\u201d in a famous footnote in \u00a726 of the Transcendental\nDeduction. Is that kind of motion under discussion, perhaps\nimplicitly, in the context of the Aesthetic? Kant does not think that\nthe \u201cmotion of the subject,\u201d for instance in drawing a\ncircle, is empirical, but he does think that it requires\u2014indeed,\nit apparently exemplifies\u2014the unity of the manifold of intuition\nimposed by the unity of consciousness. Whatever this doctrine may\nmean, it seems clear that from Kant\u2019s own perspective it cannot\nbe dealt with in the Aesthetic, for the latter text abstracts from all\ncontributions of understanding and therefore abstracts from any\nconsideration of the unity of the manifold imposed by the unity of\nunderstanding. (This seems to be closely related to Kant\u2019s point\nin \u00a726 that it is only from within the point of view of the\nTranscendental Analytic that one is able to make a distinction between\nwhat he calls space as a form of intuition and space as a\nformal intuition.) So from Kant\u2019s point of view,\nalthough various kinds of motion are considered in the critical\nphilosophy\u2014including the so-called motion of the subject in\ndescribing a space, the motion of a mathematical point through space,\nand the motion of a body through space\u2014no kind of motion can be\nconsidered within the context of the Aesthetic (see Pollok 2006).\n\nThis seems to suggest that Kant\u2019s interest in the\nabsolutism-relationalism debate does not originate with his concern to\ndiscuss motion in any sense of the term. In what follows,\nthen, one goal is to specify why Kant remains focused in the Aesthetic\non the views of Leibniz and Newton (and their respective followers).\nIt may be that Kant\u2019s interest derives from his general interest\nin the views of what he calls the \u201cmetaphysicians,\u201d the\nLeibnizians, and of what he calls the \u201cmathematicians,\u201d\nthe Newtonians. Throughout the pre-critical and critical periods, Kant\nevinces considerable interest in various attempts to reconcile certain\naspects of Leibnizian metaphysics with the Newtonian view of nature\n(Friedman 1992, 1\u201352). But there is also more to be said about\nKant\u2019s focus on the absolutism-relationalism debate (see\nespecially Messina 2018), which we do below.\n2.2 Kant\u2019s understanding of representation\n\nIn a famous passage in the first Critique, Kant helpfully\ndiscusses his notion of representation (A320/B376\u201377):\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nKant regards an intuition as a conscious, objective\nrepresentation\u2014this is strictly distinct from sensation, which\nhe regards not as a representation of an object, property, event,\netc., but merely as a state of the subject. Whereas sensations do not\nrepresent anything distinct from the sensing subject (including\nperhaps the state of the subject\u2019s body), intuitions are\nobjective\n representations.[2]\n Recent scholarship emphasizes the importance of his distinction\nbetween sensation and intuition (Allais 2015, 145\u201347, 154,\n159\u201360).\n\nThe distinction between sensation and intuition in Kant\u2019s\nthinking is fundamental to his overarching conception of space and\ntime. This is the case for several reasons, not least because one\nshould avoid thinking that Kant takes us to have a sensation of space;\nwe have, rather, an intuition of it (see Carson 1997). The distinction\nhas many facets, but the basic idea is as follows. Sensations are\nsubjective in the sense that they do not represent objects, they are\nmodifications of the subject. A good example of a sensation would be\nan itch that I feel. Of course, an itch might be caused (e.g.) by some\nflour that fell on my nose while baking cookies, but the itch does not\nrepresent the flour, or indeed anything outside myself; the itch is\nsimply what I feel. If we felt only sensations, we would lack\nrepresentations of things other than ourselves, even if such things\ncaused or helped to cause our sensations. Perhaps sensations would\nenable us to avoid injury or pain--one might, say, jump back when\nfeeling heat from a fire. But without intuition, we would lack spatial\nawareness: that is, we would lack an awareness of things in spatial\nlocations around us. In order to represent things other than\nourselves, we require intutition, which Kant regards as a singular,\nimmediate, objective representation (where sensations are merely\nsubjective, as we have seen). In what sense is intuition an objective\nrepresentation that is singular and immediate? That complex idea\nmeans, for starters, that intuition represents particulars, i.e.,\nthings with some spatial location vis-\u00e0-vis me and also other\nthings. So when I feel an itch, I have a sensation; when I see the\npile of flour in front of me next to the bowl on my counter, I have an\nintuition, a representation of something in space with a location\nrelative to me and to other things. However, although intuition\ncan represent flour on the counter next to the bowl, it does not\nrepresent it as flour. For that, one would require a\n concept.[3]\n\n\nAs is well known, the distinction between concepts and intuition is\nalso fundamental to Kant\u2019s thought. Whereas intuitions are\nsingular, immediate representations, concepts are general, mediate\nones (Engstrom 2006). Each item represents properties, objects, or\nstates of affairs, but they do so distinctly. Unfortunately, there is\nno consensus on the right way to understand this\n idea.[4]But\n roughly speaking, intuition represents some X\u2014where\nX might be an object, a property, or perhaps even an\nevent\u2014as one represents X in perception. Thus it\nrepresents X as, for instance, that\n there.[5]In\n contrast, a concept represents X\u2014where, again,\nX might be a property, an object, or perhaps even an\nevent\u2014by placing X within one or more classes. Suppose\nthat I want to represent my desk, at which I am sitting right now. To\nrepresent my desk in intuition is to represent it as something I point\nto, as that there. This does not indicate, of course, that\nthis is a desk, my desk, a piece of furniture, made of wood, etc., but\nit does pick out a particular, something with a spatial location\nrelative to me and to other things (like the carpet on the floor). It\ndoes so immediately at least in the sense that it makes use\nof no other representation. To represent my desk with a concept is to\nrepresent it as a desk, or as a piece of furniture,\nor as a wooden thing, etc. From Kant\u2019s point of view,\nthis is to represent my desk mediately at least in the sense\nthat the concept, <desk>, represents an object through other\nconcepts, such as\n <furniture>.[6]\n It is also important to remember that in representing my desk through\nintuition, i.e., in representing it as a thing with some spatial\nlocation but not yet qua desk, I am perceiving the\ndesk but not judging it to be a desk (or anything else). In\norder to judge that there is a desk in front of me, or\nindeed, in order to judge that there is something in front of me, I\nrequire concepts and the complex machinery discussed in the famous\nTranscendental Deduction, a key section of the Critique that\narrives after the arguments of the Transcendental Aesthetic have been\npresented. Intuition alone is akin to perception--it plays a role in\njudgment, but it is not itself akin to \njudgment.[7]\n\nOne of Kant\u2019s surprising ideas is that each type of objective\nrepresentation, intuition and concept, can be either empirical or\na priori. The idea that some concepts are not empirical may\nnot be surprising because of the famous early modern\ntradition concerning innate ideas. Of course, Kant\u2019s\nconception of the origin of such concepts\u2014outlined in\nwhat he calls the \u201cmetaphysical deduction\u201d (B159,\nB377)\u2014contains surprises because he does not embrace innate\nideas (Longuenesse 1998). But leaving that complication aside, it is\nsurely very surprising to hear that intuition, which in some regards\nis akin to perception (Parsons 1992, 65\u201366; Allais 2015,\n147ff), can also be empirical or a priori in\ncharacter. Here it helps to recall that Kant distinguishes sensation\nfrom intuition. There remains a question, however, of how we are to\nunderstand the very idea that we can have pure\u2014or a\npriori, i.e., non-empirical\u2014intuition at all. This idea\ncomprises a central piece of Kant\u2019s views on space and time, for\nhe famously contends that space and time are nothing but forms of\nintuition, a view connected to the claim in the Transcendental\nAesthetic that we have pure intuitions of space and of time. This\nmeans, as we have seen, that we have non-empirical, singular,\nimmediate representations of space and of time. One goal of this entry\nis to clarify this idea. It is not a stretch to contend that it\nrepresents one of Kant\u2019s most distinctive contributions to\nmodern philosophy. Characteristically, it is profoundly difficult to\ngrasp.\n3. The \u201cMetaphysical Exposition\u201d\n3.1 What is a metaphysical exposition?\n\nWhat Kant calls the Metaphysical Exposition of the Concept of Space\npresents the first arguments of the Transcendental Aesthetic. Kant\ndefines the \u201cexposition\u201d of a concept as follows:\n\u201cBy an exposition (expositio) I understand the clear\n(if it is not explicit) representation of what belongs to a concept;\nit is metaphysical if it contains what the concept presents as a\npriori given\u201d (A23/B38). By a concept (Begriff) in\nthis context I take Kant simply to mean a\n representation.[8]\n So his goal is to characterize the content of the representation of\n space. For Kant, an \u201cexposition\u201d is different from a definition: he\n is not undertaking a definition of space, the word\n \u2018space,\u2019 or the concept <space> (for helpful\n discussion, see Dunlop 2012). In this regard, Kant follows a long\n tradition emanating from Newton\u2019s Scholium following the\n Definitions in the\nPrincipia, where Newton explains that space, time and motion\nare familiar to everyone and therefore will not be defined in his\nwork, unlike unfamiliar technical concepts like mass or\nimpressed force, which are defined (Newton 1999, 408). Unlike\nNewton, however, Kant focuses primarily on our representation of\nspace, rather than on space itself. That seems to be expressed by his\nnotion of an exposition.\n3.2 The origin of our representation of space\n\nIn the first argument of the Metaphysical Exposition, Kant suggests\nthat the representation of space cannot be empirical:\n\n1. Space is not an empirical concept which has been derived from outer\nexperiences. For in order that certain sensations be referred to\nsomething outside me (that is, to something in another region of space\nfrom that in which I find myself), and similarly in order that I may\nbe able to represent them as outside and alongside one another, and\naccordingly as not only different but as in different places, the\nrepresentation of space must already underlie them [dazu mu\u00df die\nVorstellung des Raumes schon zum Grunde liegen]. Therefore, the\nrepresentation of space cannot be obtained through experience from the\nrelations of outer appearance; this outer experience is itself\npossible at all only through that representation (A23/B38).\n\n\nOne might wonder what type of view is at issue here. One potential\ntarget is a classic empiricist account of our idea of space, such as\nthat found in Locke. Acknowledging in the Essay that the idea\nof space seems to be \u201cremote\u201d from our perception of\nobjects, Locke contends nonetheless that its origin lies in experience\n(Essay, 2.13.2\u20134): perceivers observe objects in close\nproximity to one another, including the distance between objects, and\nthen repeatedly add the ideas of these distances together, thereby\nobtaining an idea of as large a single space as they please. According\nto Locke\u2019s view, a version of which was also defended by Hume\n(Treatise, 1.2.3), we obtain a representation of\nspace\u2014not of places, but of the one all-encompassing space,\nwhich may be akin to geometric space\u2014from the\nperception of spatial relations.\n\nKant may be focusing attention on the starting place of Locke\u2019s\nview. It seems that for Locke, we begin with an idea of the distance\nbetween any two bodies; this would presumably involve an idea of these\ntwo bodies as being in different places. Kant may be contending that\nin order to represent objects as in different places from one another,\nI must represent them as in space. But if this were true, then I would\nalready have, as it were, the representation of space, and therefore\ncould not obtain it in the way Locke outlines.\n\nDaniel Warren clarifies this argument in an especially helpful way\n(Warren 1998; cf. Allison 2004, 100\u2013104). Certainly, it is not true in\ngeneral that in any order to represent any two entities, A and B, as\nrelated in some way, I must represent them as falling into a larger\n\u201cspace\u201d of some relevant character. Warren gives a useful\nexample: in order to represent A as \u201cbrighter than\u201d B, I\nneed not represent A and B as being part of a larger\n\u201cbrightness\u201d space. I could do so: I could\nrepresent A and B via the \u201cbrightness\u201d relation precisely\nby representing A as lying at one end of a brightness spectrum, and B\nas lying near its other end. But I need not do so: I could simply\nrepresent A and B themselves, and represent A as brighter than B, as I\nmight do with two lights (Warren 1998, 200ff). The suggestion\nis that in order to represent A and B as bearing a spatial\nrelation with one another\u2014say, to represent them as being some\ndistance apart\u2014I must represent A and B as in space. In\nthat sense, the representation of objects as spatially related may\npresuppose the representation of space. The problem for Locke is that\nhe begins with my perception, or idea, of a distance between two\nobjects, and then proceeds to construct my idea of space from that\ninitial point. But if my representation of a distance relation between\nany two objects already presupposes a representation of those objects\nas in space, then the former cannot be the beginning point of a\nprocess that issues in the latter. Some commentators have noted\nthat Locke\u2014or another classical empiricist\u2014may not be the\nonly focus for Kant\u2019s first argument. At some moments, Leibniz\nseems committed to the view that the representation of space is\nconstructed from particular perceptions of distance relations (and the\nlike). For instance, in a famous passage in his final letter to\nClarke, Leibniz claims that in order to obtain a representation of\nspace, one can consider a system of objects, some of which are in\nmotion, and abstract the notion same place from that\n system.[9]\n For A and B to occupy the same place is for them to have the same\nrelation to the same bodies in space at different times. Space is what\nencompasses all such\n places.[10]\n Kant\u2019s first argument may have some bite against the view in\nthis passage as well. Whether Kant\u2019s argument also undermines\nLeibniz\u2019s relationalism about space is a separate issue, and a\nmatter of\n controversy.[11]\n\nSome commentators have thought that Kant\u2019s second argument in\nthe Metaphysical Exposition is intended specifically to undermine\nLeibniz\u2019s relationalism (cf. Parsons 1992, 68\u20139):\n\n2. Space is a necessary a priori representation that\nunderlies all outer intuitions. One can never forge a representation\nof the absence of space, though one can quite well think that no\nthings are to be met within it. It must therefore be regarded as the\ncondition of the possibility of appearances, and not as a\ndetermination dependent upon them, and it is an a priori\nrepresentation that necessarily underlies outer appearances.\n(A24/B38\u20139)\n\n\nKant claims that although we can represent space as empty, we cannot\nrepresent to ourselves the absence of space. This point would\nundermine Leibnizian relationalism if the relationalist claim that\nspace is not independent of objects is, at least in part, founded on\nthe claim that the very idea of space existing independently of\nobjects is incoherent. If one held such a view, one could raise doubts\nabout relationalism by contending, as Kant does, that we can in fact\nconceive of space to be devoid of objects.\n\nThe view that space cannot exist independently of objects at any given\ninstant does seem to entail that space cannot be utterly devoid of\nobjects. Leibniz thinks that space is the order of the actual and\npossible relations among objects, so he has the resources to\nsay that space can contain empty sectors\u2014see New\nEssays, 127, and L 5: 43\u2014but it seems he cannot claim that\nspace is altogether empty, for then object relations would be\nabsent. Yet this view seems perfectly compatible with the idea that we\ncan conceive of empty space. Leibniz himself makes repeated\nand explicit use of the thought of such a situation when attempting to\nundermine the Newtonian view that space is absolute. Instead of\narguing that the idea that space could be independent of objects is\nincoherent, Leibniz contends that it violates the principle of\nsufficient reason (see L3: 5; L 5: 53), a principle Clarke himself\ndefends in a distinct version. The \u201cfiction\u201d (L5: 29; cf.\nL5: 55) that space could exist independently of objects violates the\nprinciple because the homogeneity and uniformity of space prevent\nthere from being any reason for God to place the objects of the\nuniverse with one particular orientation within absolute space rather\nthan with any other possible orientation. The idea that God could\nplace objects within a pre-existing absolute space with one\norientation rather than another is evidently not incoherent; rather,\nGod would lack a reason for doing this. Similarly, Leibniz\ncontends that absolutism violates the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles (L4: 16) and that it bears theological difficulties\n(L4: 10).\n\nThis is not to deny that Leibniz\u2019s relationalism intersects with\nhis understanding of the representation of space. He thinks that we\nmust not be fooled by the fact that we can think of space as empty of\nobjects into concluding that space itself is something independent of\nobjects and their relations. As with all mere abstractions, we must\nnot reify\n space.[12]\n\nOne might read Kant\u2019s second argument instead as\nstraightforwardly targeting the view that the representation of space\nis empirical. Kant claims that we cannot represent the absence of\nspace, but that we can represent space as empty of objects. His point\nmay be that empiricist philosophers who contend that the\nrepresentation of space is obtained from the perception of objects\nmust bear the burden of explaining how it is possible for us to\nconceive of space as empty of such objects. This consideration appears\nto be rather weak. But the further contention that one cannot\nrepresent the absence of space may be more difficult for an empiricist\nto accept. Prima facie, it is difficult to see why, if our\nrepresentation of space is indeed empirical in origin, we should lack\nthe ability to conceive of space\u2019s absence. This might\nbe read as Kant\u2019s prima facie point against an\nempiricist view of the representation of space.\n\nIn these first two arguments, Kant considers, perhaps among other\nthings, the origin of our representation of space, concluding that it\nis not empirical. It seems, though, that these first two arguments\nleave open the question of the content of our representation\nof space in two important senses. First, Kant\u2019s first two\narguments do not explicate what properties we represent space as\nhaving. Do we represent it, for instance, as finite or infinite, as\nhomogeneous or not? And so on. Second, the first two arguments in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic apparently leave it open that the content of\nour representation of space could be conceptual. That is, they leave\nit open that our representation of space could be a concept, rather\nthan an intuition\u2014it could be either a general, mediate\nrepresentation, or a singular, immediate one. We simply know\u2014if\nKant\u2019s arguments are successful\u2014that the representation is\nnot empirical. And Kant certainly thinks that a non-empirical\nrepresentation could be either a concept or an intuition; that is, he\nthinks that we have both a priori concepts and pure\nintuition. Since the idea of pure intuition is puzzling in a way that\nthe idea of an a priori concept may not be, one interpretive\ngoal is to clarify this idea in the course of understanding the second\ntwo arguments of the Metaphysical Exposition.\n3.3 The content of our representation of space\n\nIn the third and fourth arguments, Kant contends that the\nrepresentation of space has a specifiable content that is incompatible\nwith it being a conceptual representation. That is, he argues that our\nrepresentation of space is not a concept, but is in fact an\nintuition\u2014it is a singular, immediate representation. As we have\nseen, the distinction between sensation and intuition indicates that\nthis claim does not amount to the idea that we have a sensation of\nspace (for reasons adduced above). Instead, it amounts to the claim\nthat we have an objective representation of space, but one that is\nsingular and immediate.\n\nIn order to understand the two arguments intended to establish the\nconclusion that we have a singular, immediate representation of space,\nit is helpful to recall Kant\u2019s attitude toward concepts. From\nhis point of view, whereas to fall \u201cunder\u201d a concept means\nto be part of a concept\u2019s extension, to fall\n\u201cwithin\u201d a concept means to be part of its intension. Just\nas significantly, the extension of a concept, in Kant\u2019s way of\nthinking, is not the things that instantiate the concept, or the set\nof things to which the concept \u201capplies\u201d; rather, it is\nthe class of concepts that function as sub-groupings falling under\nthis more general heading. This idea requires clarification.\n\nConsider the extension of\n <being>:[13]\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nThe extension of <being> is those concepts on the conceptual\ntree that fall \u201cunder\u201d <being>\u2014those concepts\nare species of the genus, <being>. Kant speaks of a series of\ngenus-species relations inhering between the members of the class of\nconcepts that serve as a given concept\u2019s extension; whether a\nconcept serves as a genus or a species is relative. The concept\n<created> is a genus with respect to its species\n<material> and <immaterial>, but a species with respect to\nthe genus <being>. The intension of a concept consists\nof those concepts that collectively constitute it. Hence the concept\n<human> has this intension: \u201crational animate material\ncreated being.\u201d The concepts that collectively constitute a\ngiven concept are often called \u201cMerkmale\u201d or\n\u201cTeilbegriffe,\u201d or what might be called its conceptual\nparts (\u201cVienna Logic,\u201d Ak 24: 913). To construct the\nconcept <human>, one puts together the concepts\n<rational>, <animate>, <material>,\n<created>, and <being>. To formulate or to grasp the\nconcept <human> just is to grasp these\nconstituents.\n\nWith these distinctions in mind, we can consider Kant\u2019s third\nargument in the Metaphysical Exposition. In this argument, Kant\nconcentrates on the intension (in his sense) of a concept.\n\n3. Space is not a discursive, or as one says, general concept of\nrelations of things in general, but a pure intuition. For, firstly,\none can represent only one space, and if one speaks of many spaces,\none thereby understands only parts of one and the same unique space.\nThese parts cannot precede the one all-embracing space as being, as it\nwere, constituents out of which it can be composed, but can only be\nthought as in it. It is essentially one; the manifold in it,\nand therefore also the general concept of spaces, depends solely on\nlimitations. It follows from this that an a priori intuition\n(which is not empirical) underlies all concepts of space. Similarly,\ngeometrical propositions, that, for instance, in a triangle two sides\ntogether are greater than the third, can never be derived from the\ngeneral concepts of line and triangle, but only from intuition and\nindeed a priori with apodictic certainty. (A24\u20135/B39\u201340; cf.\n\u201cAnticipations of Perception\u201d at A169\u201370/B211)\n\n\nThe suggestion here is roughly this: if the representation of space\nwere a concept rather than an intuition, one ought to be able to\nconstruct it by placing its parts together. This seems to require that\nit is possible to represent the parts independently of representing\nthe concept to be constructed. This is the case with other concepts:\nit is possible to represent any of the parts of the intension of\n<human>, such as <material being>, without ipso\nfacto representing the whole concept, <human>. Kant is\nclaiming that this will not work in the case of the representation of\nspace because we obtain the representation of places only by\ndelimiting some subsection of our representation of the one\nall-encompassing space. To put the point in a way that highlights a\nparallel with the first argument of the Metaphysical Exposition: the\nrepresentation of any place presupposes the representation of space.\nThus we cannot represent any of the \u201cparts\u201d of\nspace\u2014any place\u2014without ipso facto representing\nspace itself. The idea, then, is that the part-whole relation of the\nrepresentation of space is distinct from the part-whole relation that\nobtains for concepts.\n\nIt is not clear that this argument is successful. It seems, e.g., to\nconflate the following: (1) the relation between space and its parts;\nand, (2) the relation between the representation of space and its\nconstituents. Without this conflation, it is not clear why we should\nexpect to construct our concept of space from our concept of place. It\nwould seem more sensible to construct our concept of space from other\nconcepts, such as that of infinity, or that of a magnitude, and so on,\nrather than from the concept of a place. The claim of the conflation\nis predicated on the notion that Kant\u2019s third argument concerns\nthe representation of space rather than space itself. This notion, in\nturn, may conflict with the letter, although perhaps not with the\nspirit, of the first sentence of the third argument, which mentions\nthat \u201cDer Raum,\u201d or space, is not a concept, but rather is\nan intuition. If one follows the letter of the argument, one can avoid\nthis apparent conflation. But the price is somewhat high: what does it\nmean to wonder whether space itself is a concept, and who held\nsomething like that view? On the face of it, such a view may seem\nrather odd to the contemporary\n reader.[14]\n One way to make progress in understanding this view is to re-read\nLeibniz. It is possible to read Leibniz as arguing that space itself\nis a kind of abstraction, rather than a real entity or substance, and\nperhaps it is not a stretch to contend that space must be a conceptual\nabstraction, like the entities of what Leibniz might call pure\nmathematics. That is, space itself, on this view, is a kind of\nconceptual abstraction in the way that an isosceles triangle is an\nabstraction, or a line is an abstraction, rather than a real entity or\nsubstance. Of course, this requires us to understand Leibniz\u2019s\nposition through a Kantian lens. Even so, if the view in focus is that\nspace itself is a kind of concept, it remains unclear why one\nwouldn\u2019t say that this concept is dependent on other\nconstitutive concepts, such as the concept of infinity or that of\nhomogeneity, which Kant himself tackles in the next numbered argument.\nPerhaps the best answer here is to read Kant as engaging specifically\nwith Leibniz\u2019s argument in his last (fifth) exchange with\nClarke, mentioned above. The idea is that Leibniz\u2019s argument\nmight be understood as involving the claim that the concept of place\nis constitutive of the concept of space, and that space itself is\nreally nothing but a kind of concept, which licenses the exclusive\nfocus on the concept of space. Then the claim would be that the\nLeibnizian view that space itself is a conceptual abstraction obtained\nthrough some process of perceiving objects occupying various places is\nwrong on both counts.\n\nJust as Kant\u2019s second argument attempts to shore-up the idea,\npresented in the first argument, that the representation of space is\na priori, his fourth and final argument attempts to shore-up\nthe idea, presented in the third argument, that the representation of\nspace is not conceptual in character. Here both the extension and the\nintension of concepts seem to be at issue:\n\n4. Space is represented as an infinite given magnitude. Now\none must think every concept as a representation which is contained in\nan infinite number of different possible representations (as their\ncommon mark), and which therefore contains these under\nitself; but no concept, as such, can be thought as if it\ncontained an infinite number of representations within\nitself. It is in this latter way, however, that space is thought\n(for all the parts of space are simultaneous in infinity [denn alle\nTeile des Raumes ins Unendliche sind zugleich]). Therefore the\noriginal representation of space is an a priori intuition,\nnot a concept (B40).\n\n\nKant claims that since we represent space as containing an infinite\nnumber of places within it, our representation of space cannot be\nconceptual. Why should that be? The idea is that although concepts can\nhave an infinite extension\u2014a potentially infinite number of\nsubordinate concepts under them\u2014they cannot have an\ninfinite intension, an infinite number of representations\nwithin them. A concept that is infinite in the latter sense\ncould not be grasped by a finite\n mind.[15]\n For a concept to have an infinite extension would be for it to have\nan infinite number of species, i.e. for it to be possible to\ndistinguish an infinite number of sub-types \u201cunder\u201d it on\nthe conceptual tree. This does not harm our ability to grasp any\nconcept within the tree, for to grasp any arbitrarily chosen concept\nwithin the tree, I merely need to grasp its constituents (those\nconcepts within it), and those would be \u201cabove\u201d\nit on the tree. But our ability to grasp concepts would be affected if\nthey could contain an infinite number of constituents within\nthemselves: if, say, <fish> contained an infinite number of\nconstituents\u2014if there were an infinite number of higher-level\nconceptual taxa \u201cabove\u201d <fish> on the tree\u2014it\ncould not be grasped, and might even lack determinate content. Or at\nleast, to specify its content would take an infinite number of\nsteps.\n\nAccording to Kant, however, we represent space as having an infinite\nnumber of constituents, namely\n places.[16]\n If our representation of space were conceptual, we would be required\nto represent each of these constituents in order to represent\nspace itself, just as we are required to represent metal in order\nto represent gold (for <gold> catergorizes gold as a metal). Yet\nwe cannot represent every place within space in an effort to represent\nspace itself. If we can take it as settled that we represent space,\nand as settled that we represent it as having an infinite number of\nplaces within it, then our representation of space presumably cannot\nbe conceptual in Kant\u2019s sense. The third argument in the\nMetaphysical Exposition seems to imply, as we have seen, that the\nrepresentation of any place presupposes the representation of space\nitself. This fourth argument makes a distinct point: if the\nrepresentation of space itself were to require the representation of\neach part that we represent space as having, then we could not\nrepresent space at all. Since we do represent space, and since we do\nrepresent it as having an infinite number of places within it, our\nrepresentation of space is not conceptual in Kant\u2019s sense. Of\ncourse, Kant\u2019s readers may deny one of his apparent assumptions\nhere, viz., that we represent space as infinite. Readers with broadly\nempiricist sympathies in particular may be skeptical of this\nassumption.\n\nKant\u2019s view that we have an intuition, rather than a concept, of\nspace can be seen to raise a difficult problem: space is not an\nobject, and yet intuition seems to provide us with something akin to a\nperception of something. As Lucy Allais puts it, intuition involves\n\u201cpresence to consciousness of an object\u201d (Allais 2015,\n197ff), and yet space is not an object. It is difficult to\nsee why we should think of ourselves as perceiving space at all. It is\neasy enough to understand the idea that some ordinary thing, like a\ntomato, is an object that is present to my consciousness, say when I\nlook at the tomato on a farm stand. There are, of course, many\nphilosophical theories of perception, and these theories will differ\nin their discussions even of simple cases of perception such as this\none. But it seems uncontroversial to suppose that the tomato is\npresent to my consciousness as an object at least in the sense that\nthe tomato is one of the things that I\u2019m looking at. And it also\nseems uncontroversial to think that there are many other things,\nbesides tomatoes, that might be present to my consciousness in a\nsimilar way, from clouds to fog to rainbows, even though they are not\n\u201cobjects\u201d in the simple sense in which a tomato is an\nobject. However, it certainly seems like a stretch to say that space\nitself might be one of those things. That is not merely because space\nis not an object in any clear sense; it is also because space itself,\nin this historical and philosophical context, is not something that\nhas a causal impact on me. So it remains doubly difficult to see how I\nmight conclude, with Kant, that I have something akin to a perception\nof space. Kant assures us, of course, that we have an a\npriori intuition of space, so although he is discussing something\nakin to perception in one sense, in another sense what he is\ndiscussing is supposed to be quite distinct from ordinary perception.\nWhether that assurance helps to clarify this issue for his readers is\na matter of debate. What is clear, however, is that this aspect of\nKant\u2019s conception of space remains one of the most\ncontroversial, and most difficult, aspects of his theoretical\nphilosophy.\n\nKant may have other reasons for thinking that our representation of\nspace is not a concept. If we recall Kant\u2019s view that concepts\nare general, mediate representations, and his view of how these facts\nare reflected in the conceptual trees discussed above, then there is\nindeed at least a prima facie puzzle as to how we could have\na concept, in Kant\u2019s sense, of space. Consider a contrast class.\nEven if we think that <God> represents only a single entity,\nthat fact does not undermine Kant\u2019s view that this concept is a\ngeneral, mediate representation (cf. Thompson 1972, 318\u201319, 328\u201329).\nFor we represent God, in Kant\u2019s view, by representing it through\nother concepts: for instance, God is a necessary substance\n(A678/B706), so <God> is a mediate representation. This is\ndistinct from the way in which an intuition represents something. And\nthe concept <substance>\u2014which is one of the\ncategories (A80/B106)\u2014is a representation that we can grasp\nindependently of grasping <God>. Hence <substance> is a\nconstituent of <God>, but not vice versa. Moreover,\n<God> is a general representation because it places God\nwithin another class, namely the class of substances. It will then be\na matter of some dispute whether the generality criterion and\nthe mediacy criterion amount to the same thing (cf. Parsons\n1992, 63\u20136). But the key point here is this: the fact that\n<God> picks out a single individual\u2014and perhaps even,\ncan pick out only a single individual\u2014does not entail\nthat this concept is not general or mediate. This suggests, in turn,\nthat Kant\u2019s point in the Metaphysical Exposition cannot be that\nour representation of space picks out a single individual and\ntherefore cannot be a concept. Rather, he presumably thinks that we do\nnot represent space either: (1) by representing its constituents,\nnamely places; or (2) by representing it through other\nconcepts. We have discussed (1) above; what about (2)?\n\nConcerning (2), note that to represent space by representing it\nthrough other concepts may require one to take a (usually\ncontroversial) stand on the ontology of space in one of the senses\noutlined above. For instance, if one wishes to place <space>\nsomewhere on the conceptual tree, one must presumably find a place for\nit under some concept such as <substance> or <being>. But\nthere is no accepted view of space\u2019s ontology: some regard it as\na substance (or a being), others as a network of relations, others as\na property of God, etc. Because of these long-standing, unresolved\ndisputes, it seems reasonable to regard an approach that depends on\ntheir resolution as unpromising. Kant highlights the accepted fact\nthat we represent space as an infinite Euclidean magnitude\u2014this\ncan be widely accepted, despite the dispute concerning space\u2019s\nontology.\n\nAnother way to clarify Kant\u2019s arguments regarding conceptuality\nis to consider what opponent he has in mind for the second two\narguments. It seems unlikely that Locke\u2019s views are at issue in\nthese arguments\u2014instead, Kant probably had Leibniz in mind.\nLeibniz held the view that the idea (or representation) of space hails\nfrom the pure understanding, which he contrasts with the kind of\nLockean view noted above. He writes in the New Essays:\n\n\nPHILALETHES: The ideas the perception of which comes to us \u201cby\nmore than one sense, are of space, or extension, figure, motion and\nrest.\u201d\n\nTHEOPHILUS: These ideas, which are said to come from more than one\nsense \u2013 like those of space, figure, motion \u2013 come rather\nfrom the common sense, which is to say, from the mind itself; for they\nare ideas of the pure understanding, though ones which relate to the\nexternal world and which the senses make us perceive, and so they\nadmit of definitions and demonstrations. (New Essays, 128;\nsee Leibniz 1840, 230)\n\n\nLeibniz may have in mind the idea that our perceptions cannot give us\nthe idea of a continuum, and he certainly thinks of space as a\ncontinuum. The senses, for instance, cannot give us the idea of\nsomething that is infinitely divisible. Elsewhere in the New\nEssays, Leibniz makes a related point by saying that space is\nakin to the entities of \u201cpure mathematics.\u201d\n\nOne question here is whether Leibniz and Kant agree sufficiently in\ntheir views of concepts for Kant\u2019s arguments to have any bite\nagainst the kind of view Leibniz expresses in the New Essays,\na text that Kant read sometime after it was first available in 1765\n(Vaihinger 1922, 2: 133, 414 and 428\u20139). Leibniz, famously, has the\nidea of a complete concept of a substance, and it seems that such as\nconcept would contain an infinite number of constituents\u2014God\ngrasps the complete concept of a substance by grasping all its\nconstituents. Given this view, it may be that the considerations\nadduced in Kant\u2019s fourth argument in the Metaphysical Exposition\nare unlikely to worry Leibniz, since he would simply accept the idea\nthat the representation of space, as with any concept, might have an\ninfinite number of constituents (Posy 2000). However, the third\nargument may have more bite: if Kant is right in contending that the\nrepresentation of any place presupposes the representation of space\nitself, then perhaps that representation lacks the ordinary part-whole\nstructure of a concept. Leibniz may in fact accept that general\nconception of the part-whole structure of concepts. If so, this third\nargument may present a problem for his view.\n\nYet the first and second arguments of the Exposition are not merely\nopportunities to contend with empiricist views like those of Locke;\nnor are the third and fourth arguments merely aimed at challenging\nrationalist views like those of Leibniz. On the contrary, the claim\nthat the representation of space is neither empirical nor conceptual\nis important in general for Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism and,\nin tandem, it is significant for understanding what he regards as the\nphilosophical mistakes embodied in transcendental realism, and in what\nKant will later call \u201cdogmatic idealism,\u201d both of which he\nstrongly opposes. These are discussed in the next section.\n4. The \u201cTranscendental Exposition\u201d and Kant\u2019s \u201cconclusions\u201d\n4.1 What is a transcendental exposition?\n\nIn the B (1787) edition of the Critique, \u00a72 of the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, the Metaphysical Exposition, is followed by\n\u00a73, the Transcendental Exposition. Whereas the Metaphysical\nExposition deals, as we have seen, with the origin and the content of\nthe representation of space, its transcendental cousin apparently\nattempts to provide an explanation of what Kant takes to be the\nsynthetic a priori knowledge (or cognition) available to us in\ngeometry. This raises very difficult interpretive issues that arise\nwith Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics\u2014such issues are\ndealt with in a separate entry in this Encyclopedia (see Lisa\nShabel\u2019s entry on\n Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics).\n However, Kant may also be raising a related point in this\nsection\u2014consider the following passage, which is inserted within\nthe discussion of geometry (cf. section 2-b above):\n\nNow how can an outer intuition inhabit the mind, which precedes the\nobjects themselves, and in which the concept of the latter can be\ndetermined a priori? Obviously not otherwise than insofar as\nit has its seat solely in the subject, as its formal constitution for\nbeing affected by objects, and thereby gaining immediate\nrepresentation, i.e., intuition, of them, therefore only\nas the form of outer sense in general. (B41)\n\n\nWe have seen in the Metaphysical Exposition that we have a pure (or\na priori) intuition of space, that is, a non-empirical,\nsingular, immediate representation of space. But how is such a\nrepresentation so much as possible? If we are considering an\nempirical, singular, immediate representation, we can easily\nunderstand that in cases of ordinary perception, we can (e.g.) see a\nrose in a vase in front of us. Hence our perception may include a\nsingular, immediate representation\u2014that is, we may represent\nthat there, an object with a spatial location. This empirical\ncase is reasonably clear, but what does it mean to contend that we\nhave a non-empirical, singular, immediate representation? This cannot\nbe akin to a case of seeing an object directly in front of us, for one\nof Kant\u2019s points in the Metaphysical Exposition, as we have\nseen, is that the representation of places, and of objects as bearing\nspatial relations, presupposes the (non-empirical)\nrepresentation of space. But if our representation of space is not\nakin to seeing something directly in front of us, then what makes it\nimmediate and singular? Kant\u2019s suggestion in the passage above\nappears to be that intuition must somehow have its seat in the\nsubject\u2014it must somehow be a \u201cform\u201d of the mind, or\nmore precisely, of what Kant calls here \u201couter sense\u201d.\nThis obviously brings us very close to the formulation of\ntranscendental idealism\u2014that view is stated explicitly for the\nfirst time in the Critique in the very next paragraph of the\nTranscendental Aesthetic. But the paragraph quoted above, coupled with\nKant\u2019s discussion of what a Transcendental Exposition is meant\nto be, suggests that part of Kant\u2019s goal here is to explain\nhow a non-empirical, singular, immediate representation of space is\npossible. (This is parallel to explaining how synthetic a\npriori knowledge within geometry is possible.)\n\nSimilarly, some commentators have noted that the\n\u201cconclusions\u201d following the Transcendental Exposition (in\nthe very next paragraph following the one quoted above) are given no\nadditional argumentative support, and are therefore intended to follow\nfrom the arguments within the Metaphysical Exposition and the\nTranscendental Exposition. That is, the view that the representation\nof space is an a priori intuition is supposed to entail the rather\nrobust conclusions about space that Kant reaches in the Transcendental\nAesthetic. His first such conclusion\u2014labeled \u201ca\u201d and\nfollowed by another conclusion labeled \u201cb\u201d\u2014is rather\nstartling:\n\nSpace represents no property at all of any things in themselves, nor\nany relation of them to one another, i.e., no determination of them\nthat attaches to objects themselves and that would remain even if one\nwere to abstract from all subjective conditions of intuition. For\nneither absolute nor relative determinations can\u2014prior to the\nexistence of the things to which they pertain, thus a\npriori\u2014be intuited. (A26/B42)\n\n\nAmong other things, Kant returns here to the debate concerning space\nand time between the Leibnizians and the Newtonians mentioned at the\noutset of the Transcendental Aesthetic. It seems that Kant intends his\nview to be contrasted with the Newtonian view of space, which\napparently tells us something about its \u201cabsolute\u201d\ndeterminations, and also with the Leibnizian view, which apparently\ntells us something about its \u201crelative\u201d determinations.\nPerhaps Kant is suggesting here that the Newtonian and Leibnizian\nviews of space and time, despite their evident differences along\nvarious dimensions, each indicate that the representation of space\ncannot be a non-empirical, singular, immediate representation, or\nperhaps they tacitly suppose that it cannot be such a representation.\nIf he is suggesting that idea, one wonders why that would be the case.\nI discuss this issue in the next section.\n\nIn the next few paragraphs of the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant\nreaches the famous conclusions that we can speak of space \u201conly\nfrom the human standpoint\u201d (A26/B42) and that space has\n\u201ctranscendental ideality\u201d (A28/B44). This is the heart of\none of Kant\u2019s main positions in the Critique of Pure\nReason. In order to clarify these ideas, I first follow\nKant\u2019s suggestion in the passage above that he intends his\nposition to be contrasted in some respects with the positions of\nLeibniz and of Newton. This maneuver will place us in a position to\nunderstand transcendental idealism in a bit more depth.\n4.2 Absolute/relational vs. real/ideal\n\nVarious confusions can plague one\u2019s understanding of the modern\ndebate between absolutism and relationalism about space and\ntime\u2014some of these confusions are especially pervasive in\ndiscussions of Kant\u2019s views. For instance, absolutism is\nsometimes conflated with realism, and idealism with relationalism. One\nreason for the first conflation may be historical in nature. In their\ncelebrated correspondence, which forms part of the essential\nbackground to Kant\u2019s work on space and time in the\nCritique, Clarke and Leibniz often consider the proposition:\nspace is real. By our lights, realism and anti-realism\nconcern the question of whether something is in some sense dependent\non the mind. We ask this question about tables and chairs, numbers and\nsets, and all manner of other things. But when Leibniz and Clarke\ndiscuss the \u201creality,\u201d or the \u201cabsolute\nreality,\u201d of space, they are typically concerned with the\nquestion of space\u2019s status vis-\u00e0-vis objects. This is\nclearly the case when Leibniz and Clarke consider one of the principal\nquestions of their correspondence, whether their common acceptance of\nthe principle of sufficient reason entails that one of them holds the\ncorrect conception of space (cf. L3: 4 and C 3: 4\u20135). Leibniz\ncontends, while Clarke denies, that if space were independent of\nobjects, God would lack a sufficient reason for placing the objects of\nthe universe into space with one orientation rather than another.\nLeibniz concludes from this that space lacks \u201creality\u201d or\nthat it lacks \u201cabsolute reality\u201d (see L5: 29 and L5: 36).\nBased on precisely the same considerations, Leibniz denies\nthat space is \u201cabsolute\u201d (L3: 2\u20133, L3: 5, L4: 16, L4:\n9\u201310) and contends that it is \u201crelative\u201d (L3: 4).\nHence in this context, for space to be real is for space to\nexist independently of objects and relations.\n\nLikewise, Leibniz\u2019s contention that space is ideal (L5:\n33) serves as his response to Clarke\u2019s claim (C4: 7) that there\ncan be \u201cextramundane\u201d space, that is, space beyond the\nboundaries of the object-universe. Here, too, the contention that\nspace is ideal\u2014or that it lacks reality\u2014amounts to the\ncontention that it cannot exist independently of objects.\nThis is evident in a passage from Leibniz\u2019s last letter:\n\nI have demonstrated that space is nothing other than an order of the\nexistence of things observed in their simultaneity. And therefore the\nfiction of a material finite universe, moving forward in an infinite\nempty space, cannot be admitted. It is altogether unreasonable and\nimpracticable. For, besides that there is no real space out of the\nmaterial universe, such an action would be without any design in it:\nit would be working without doing any thing\u2026It would produce no\nchange which could be observed by any person whatsoever. These are\nimaginations of philosophers who have incomplete notions, who make of\nspace an absolute reality [r\u00e9alit\u00e9 absolue] (L 5: 29).\n\n\nNote that by \u201creal space out of the material universe\u201d\nLeibniz does not mean space independent of the mind, but\nrather, space independent of objects.\n\nThis is not to say that there is no discussion of space\u2019s status\nrelative to the mind in the correspondence. Leibniz asserts in his\nlast letter that relations are \u201cideal\u201d because they are\nneither substances nor accidents, and are therefore not elements of\nreality (L5: 47). As he writes in the New Essays, in reality\nthere are only substances and properties of substances; the mind\n\u201cadds\u201d relations (New Essays, 2.12; cf. also\n2.30.4 and 2.25.1). Since space is the order of the possible relations\nof objects, it is presumably ideal in the sense of being\nmind-dependent. But Leibniz\u2019s point here seems to be that just\nas people reify relations, thinking they exist independently of\nobjects, they reify space, thinking it too exists independently of\nobjects. So even when Leibniz discusses the ideality of space, he does\nso to indicate that we need not think of relations and of space as\nabsolute in order to account for the tendency toward reification.\n\nThe ideality and reality of space bear a different significance for\nKant than they do for Leibniz and Clarke. For Kant, asking whether\nsomething is real or ideal concerns its status vis-\u00e0-vis the\nmind. One of Kant\u2019s most explicit discussions of realism and\nidealism appears in the Fourth Paralogism (A368\u2013380), where he is\nconcerned with the possible mind-dependent status of objects and with\nthe status of our knowledge of their existence. Although it is clear\nthat Kant is discussing the status of spatial objects vis-\u00e0-vis\nthe mind, in part by discussing the relation of space and time to\nthe mind, there is no treatment here of the status of space and\ntime vis-\u00e0-vis objects per se.\n\nBut I understand under the transcendental idealism of all\nappearances the doctrine according to which they are all together to\nbe regarded as mere representations, and not as things in themselves,\nand accordingly that space and time are only sensible forms of our\nintuition, but not determinations given for themselves, or conditions\nof objects as things in themselves. This idealism is opposed by\ntranscendental realism, which considers space and time as\nsomething given in themselves (independent of our sensibility). The\ntranscendental realist therefore represents outer appearances (when\none grants their reality) as things in themselves, which would exist\nindependently of us and our sensibility, and therefore also would be\noutside us according to pure concepts of the understanding. (A369)\n\n\nIn light of these points, consider the following table:\n\n\n\n Realist relationalism\n\nSpace is the order of possible relations among objects\nRelations are mind-independent\n \n Idealist relationalism\n\nSpace is the order of possible relations among objects\nRelations are mind-dependent\n  \n\n Realist absolutism\n\nSpace is an object-independent framework for object relations\nSpace is mind-independent\n \n Idealist absolutism {?}\n\nSpace is an object-independent framework for object relations\nSpace is mind-dependent\n   \n\n\nA realist can be a relationalist if she thinks space is the order of\nactual and possible relations among actual (and maybe possible)\nobjects and she thinks those relations are real. This\nindicates, incidentally, that realists about space need not think of\nit as a kind of object: it can be perfectly real and\nthe order of possible relations among objects. Indeed, Kant himself\nmay have held this view in his Physical Monadology of 1755:\nhe still accepted Leibinzian relationalism, but he rejected the\nLeibnizian construal of relations, holding them to be aspects of\n reality.[17]\n Similarly, some contemporary defenders of relationalism seem to hold\nthe view that space is the order of actual and possible relations\namong actual and possible objects, and those relations are perfectly\nreal, that is, they are not dependent on the mind in any sense.\n\nAbsolutism raises other difficulties. It is possible to think of space\nas an instantaneous framework projected onto reality by the\n mind.[18]\n If space is such a mind-dependent framework, it could still be\nthought of as independent of objects. At any rate, if absolutism\nindicates that space is independent of all objects and relations, and\nif that is held to entail that it must be independent of the mind as\nwell, we probably require some clarification of this entailment, for\nit is not obvious (Ishiguro 1972, 109). In fact, Kant may have\ndefended an absolutist-idealist conception of space in the\nInaugural Dissertation of 1770 (Friedman 1992, 29\u201331).\nClarity can be achieved only if one avoids conflating these myriad\nviews.\n\nKant consistently writes in the Critique of ideality and\nreality in the more familiar modern sense, where mind-dependence is at\nissue. His usage serves to shift the philosophical discussion\nconcerning space from a focus on relationalism and absolutism to one\non idealism and realism. Hence when he reflects on the Newtonian and\nLeibnizian conceptions of space and time in general terms in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, he eschews a discussion of the relative\nmerits of absolutism and relationalism in favor of discussing the\ncommon mistake of his predecessors. For instance, after outlining his\nconception of space and time, Kant claims: \u201cThose, however, who\nassert the absolute reality [absolute Realit\u00e4t] of space\nand time, whether they take it to be subsisting or only inhering, must\nthemselves come into conflict with the principles\n[Principien] of experience\u201d (A39/B56). The former\ngroup, also called \u201cthe mathematical investigators of\nnature,\u201d is clearly identified with the Newtonians, and the\nlatter, the \u201cmetaphysicians of nature,\u201d with the\nLeibnizians (cf. Shabel 2005, 31, 45\u20139). So transcendental idealism is\narticulated as a kind of replacement for the Leibnizian and\nNewtonian conceptions of space and time, but it is not their status as\nrelationalist and absolutist conceptions, respectively, that calls for\ntheir replacement. Rather, it is their status as representatives of a\nseparate and overarching conception of space, a conception according\nto which space (like time) is said to bear an \u201cabsolute\nreality.\u201d This occurrence of \u2018absolute\u2019 clearly\ncannot have the meaning that Leibniz and Clarke intend.\n\nThis raises a difficult question. Kant contends that transcendental\nidealism as a general conception of space is to be contrasted with\ntranscendental realism, a position he attributes both to Newton and to\nLeibniz. Yet from Leibniz\u2019s point of view, the only elements of\nreality are substances and their properties. Relations, which are\nneither substances nor properties, are not among such elements, if we\nare speaking with metaphysical rigor. This is evident in a number of\ntexts; for instance, in response to his Lockean interlocutor, Leibniz\nwrites in the New Essays: \u201cThis division of the objects\nof our thoughts into substances, modes, and relations is pretty much\nto my liking. I believe that qualities are nothing but modifications\nof substances and the understanding adds relations\n[l\u2019entendement y adjoute les relations].\u201d He adds that\nrelations are \u201cthe work of the understanding\u201d (New\nEssays, 145). Since space for Leibniz is just the order of object\nrelations, and relations are ideal, space too is ideal in some sense\n(New Essays, 145; cf. Cassirer 1902, 248). That is to say,\nthere is a sense in which spatiality does not characterize reality\n(Adams 1994, 254\u20135). These views are to be found in the letters to\nClarke and in the New Essays, both of which Kant read, and\nKant himself explicitly mentions some of\n them.[19]\n The obvious obstacles to understanding Leibniz as a realist\ncomplicate the interpretation of transcendental idealism, since Kant\nclearly thinks it is an alternative to both Leibniz\u2019s and\nNewton\u2019s allegedly realist views. This problem is tackled\nin the next section.\n5. What is transcendental realism?\n5.1 Kant\u2019s criticisms of Leibniz\n\nWhy might Kant characterize Leibniz as holding some version of the\n\u201ctranscendental realist\u201d perspective that he also\nattributes to Newton? This characterization is puzzling, as we have\nseen. If we return to the conceptual matrix above, it is not merely\nthat Leibniz considers space to be the order of the possible relations\namong objects, and therefore to be dependent upon objects and their\nrelations; it is also the case that he explicitly adopts the common\nearly modern view that relations are ideal in the sense that\nthey are somehow dependent upon the\n mind.[20]\n So prima facie, if space is a relational order, or dependent\nupon relations, and relations, in turn, are dependent upon the mind,\nthen it seems that space is itself dependent upon the mind. Thus\nLeibniz appears to deny that space is real in a\nKantian sense. Denying that space is real can be equivalent\nto denying that space is absolute; but Leibniz\u2019s relationalism,\ncoupled with his familiar early modern view of relations (an\nindependent metaphysical thesis), seems to entail that space is\nalso not real in the sense that it is not independent of the\nmind. In what sense, then, can Leibniz be called a transcendental\nrealist? Prima facie, it is unfair to interpret him in this\nway.\n\nWe might return to the first description in the Critique of\nthe Leibnizian position regarding space and time, which appears just\nbefore Kant begins the Metaphysical Exposition of Space. He asks of\nspace and time: \u201cAre they only determinations or also relations\nof things, yet such as would belong to things even if they were not\nintuited?\u201d\n (A23/B38).[21]\n This may suggest what Kant has in mind when he contends that the\nLeibnizians think of space and time as bearing an \u201cabsolute\nreality.\u201d Perhaps what he means is that for Leibniz, space has a\nreality independent of intuition, or that space exists\nindependently of intuition per se, even though it may not be\nindependent of the mind per se. But then what might this idea\nmean in more detail?\n\nIn his extensive discussion of Leibniz in the so-called Amphiboly,\nKant suggests that Leibniz\u2019s transcendental realism might be\nexpressed in his view that space and time are phenomena bene\nfundata:\n\nFourth, the famous doctrine of time and space, in which he\nintellectualized these forms of sensibility, arose solely from this\nvery same deception of transcendental reflection. If I would represent\nouter relations of things through mere understanding, this can be done\nonly through a concept of their reciprocal effect, and if I should\nconnect a state of one and the same thing with another state, then\nthis can only be done in the order of grounds and consequences. Thus\nLeibniz thought of space as a certain [gewisse] order in the community\nof substances, and of time as the dynamic sequence of their states.\nThe uniqueness and independence from things, however, which both of\nthese seem to have in themselves, he ascribed to the\nconfusion of these concepts, which made that which is a mere\nform of dynamical relations be taken for a single intuition subsisting\nby itself and preceding the things themselves. Thus space and time\nbecame the intelligible form of the connection of things (substances\nand their states) in themselves (A275\u20136/B331\u20132).\n\n\nSpace is the order of the actual and possible relations of objects;\nsince objects reflect the order of substances (in some\nvery-difficult-to-specify sense), space itself reflects the order of\nsubstances, albeit in a confused manner (see Langton 1998, 68\u201396).\nWhereas a conceptual representation of this circumstance would provide\none with a representation of the monadic order, sensibility\nmisrepresents space as an independent entity. Hence space is\nindependent of intuition in that it is the order of relations, and\nthat order reflects or expresses the order of substances, which itself\nis independent of\n intuition.[22]\n Hence space is viewed as \u201ca certain order in the community of\nsubstances,\u201d a variant of which Kant himself defended in the\npre-critical period (see Friedman\u2019s introduction to\nMetaphysical Foundations, 174).\n\nThis indicates, in turn, how to interpret the idea that transcendental\nrealism can involve different portrayals of space\u2019s relationship\nwith objects. One may think that space is independent of intuition by\nclaiming that it supervenes on the order of substances (which itself\nis independent of intuition); or, one may think that space is\nindependent of intuition by claiming that space is an independently\nexisting entity. The former is the Leibnizian view, the latter the\nNewtonian. Kant suggests as much in the Transcendental Aesthetic:\n\nWe dispute all claim of time to absolute reality [absolute\nRealit\u00e4t], namely where it would attach to things absolutely as a\ncondition or property even without regard to the form of our sensible\nintuition. Such properties, which pertain to things in themselves, can\nalso never be given to us through the senses. Therefore herein lies\nthe transcendental ideality of time, according to which, if\none abstracts from the subjective condition of our sensible intuition,\nit is nothing at all, and can be considered neither as subsisting nor\nas inhering in the objects in themselves (without their relation to\nour intuition). (A36/B52)\n\n\nThe absolutist construal of transcendental realism contends that space\nand time \u201csubsist\u201d on their own, i.e., independently of\nobjects. The relationalist construal of transcendental realism\ncontends that space and time \u201cinhere\u201d in the objects, that\nis, they do not exist independently of them. And as we have seen,\nLeibniz would also contend that ordinary objects themselves somehow\ninhere in the monadic\n order.[23]\n\nBut how does Leibniz\u2019s conception of the representation of space\nsquare with Kant\u2019s reading? In his latter letter to Clarke,\nLeibniz attempts to show that we can form an idea of space without\nrelying on the notion that space is somehow independent of the\nrelations of objects (L 5: 47). Since he talks of people\n\u201cobserving\u201d various objects and their relations to one\nanother, it can sound as if he thinks that the idea of space is\nobtained through sensory experience of object relations. But which\nidea of space does he have in mind? In other words, what is the\ncontent of the idea of space that he has in mind? He may mean that one\ncan gain a rough and ready idea of space\u2014of a three-dimensional\nmagnitude that is not itself a property of any object or grouping of\nobjects\u2014in the way that he describes. But surely one cannot gain\nthe mathematical view of space in this way, for several reasons that\nLeibniz expresses in the New Essays (as noted above): (a)\nspace and time are entities in pure mathematics; (b) space is a\ncontinuum, and one certainly cannot obtain that notion from the sense\nperception of object relations; and, (c) sense perception will\ngenerate a confused idea, but to have a clear and distinct idea of\nspace, one indicating its properties as a mathematical entity,\nrequires something other than sense perception. So it seems reasonable\nto distinguish between an ordinary, everyday conception of\nspace\u2014one in which we need not consider whether it is infinite\nor finite, infinitely divisible or finitely divisible, or perhaps\nwhether the parallel postulate holds, etc.\u2014and our geometric\nconception of space. There can be little doubt that Kant has our\ngeometric conception of space in mind throughout the Transcendental\nAesthetic\u2014this is clear in the third argument of the\nmetaphysical exposition and throughout the transcendental\nexposition.\n\nSo for Leibniz, <space>confused arises from our\nperceptual experience with objects, but <space>clear &\ndistinct could not possibly so arise. Kant himself emphasizes,\nnot only in the Amphiboly, but also in the Aesthetic itself, that the\nLeibnizians are committed to the view that\n<space>confused arises from our perceptual experience\nof objects and their relations. In \u00a77 of the Aesthetic (in the B\nedition), he writes:\n\nIf they take the second position (as do some metaphysicians of\nnature), and hold space and time to be relations of appearances (next\nto or successive to one another) that are abstracted from experience,\nthough confusedly represented in this abstraction, then they must\ncontest the validity or at least the apodictic certainty of a\npriori mathematical doctrines with respect to actual things\n(e.g., in space), since this certainty does not at all occur a\nposteriori, and according to this view the a priori\nconcepts of space and time are only creatures of the imagination, the\norigin of which must actually be sought in experience, out of whose\nabstracted relations imagination has made something that certainly\ncontains what is general in them but that cannot occur without the\nrestrictions that nature has attached to them. (A39/B56\u2013A40/B57)\n\n\nWe might read Kant\u2019s Leibniz as committed to the following\nclaims:\n\n(1)\n<space>confused arises from our perceptual\n    experience, as outlined in the last letter to Clarke; and,\n(2)\n<space>clear & distinct arises when we\n    remove the confused perceptual elements from\n    <space>confused, thereby obtaining a clear and\n    distinct idea, that is, a conceptual representation of\n    space.\n\nWe can then see the first two arguments in the Metaphysical Exposition\nas attempting to undermine (1), and the second two arguments as\nattempting to undermine (2). Thus Leibniz denies that we have an a\npriori, singular, immediate representation of space. Instead, he\nthinks we begin with an empirical representation of space, remove the\nconfused elements of that representation, and thereby obtain a clear\nand distinct idea, i.e., a conceptual representation of an abstract\nmathematical\n entity.[24]\n\nThis discussion is reminiscent of Kant\u2019s fundamental\ndisagreement with the Leibnizians regarding what Kant calls\n\u201csensibility\u201d and \u201cunderstanding.\u201d In the\nGeneral Remarks on the Aesthetic, we read:\n\nThat, therefore, our entire sensibility is nothing but the confused\nrepresentation of things, which contains solely that which pertains to\nthem in themselves, but only under a heap of marks and partial\nrepresentations that we can never separate from one another\nconsciously, is a falsification of the concept of sensibility and of\nappearance, which renders the entire theory of them useless and empty.\n(A43/B60)\n\nKant wishes to oppose this Leibnizian attitude toward\nsensibility\u2014which he goes on to label an \u201centirely unjust\nperspective\u201d (A44/B62)\u2014in a general but thoroughgoing way\nin the Aesthetic and elsewhere in the Critique. In the\nAmphiboly, for instance, he complains that Leibniz \u201cleft nothing\nfor the senses but the contemptible job of confusing and upsetting the\nrepresentations\u201d of the understanding (A276/B332). Thus Kant\ndoes not merely think that we have a non-empirical, singular,\nimmediate representation of space. He thinks\u2014if we borrow\nLeibnizian terminology\u2014that our clear and distinct\nrepresentation of space is singular and immediate. For Kant, intuition\ncan be a genuine source of clear and distinct representations.\n\nIf we return to Kant\u2019s fundamental conception of representation,\naccording to which sensation is a representation of the\nsubject\u2019s state, and intuition is an \u201cobjective\u201d\nrepresentation, we might characterize Kant\u2019s critical attitude\ntoward the Leibnizians as follows: they conflate intuition with\nsensation, or construe intuition as a kind of sensation. The\nLeibnizians fail to recognize that intuition is a kind of objective\nrepresentation, rather than a merely confused representation, one that\nis confused because it actually represents a state of the subject\nwhile purporting to represent objects. According to\nKant\u2019s Leibniz, when I have a red book in front of me,\nand then have a sensation of redness, my senses represent the book as\nhaving a property that is similar to my sensation, when in fact it\nbears a distinct property (say, a surface texture of some kind). This\nmay be the right view of the sensation of secondary\nqualities\u2014the Leibnizian error lies instead in assimilating all\ncases of perception to this kind of case, and thereby concluding that\nperception presents us only with confused ideas. If we rigorously\ndistinguish sensation from intuition \u00e0 la Kant, then we open\nthe possibility of objective representations that are akin to\nperceptions. We do not have a sensation of an infinite\nEuclidean magnitude (!), but we do have a singular and immediate\nrepresentation of it. The Leibnizians lack room for this option.\n5.2 Kant\u2019s criticisms of Newton\n\nKant focuses most of his critical gaze in the Aesthetic on Leibniz and\nthe Leibnizians. This may reflect the fact that Leibniz held, as we\nhave seen, well-developed views concerning space and time and their\nrepresentation. Newton did not hold extensive views about the\nrepresentation of space and time (although he had a minimal\nperspective on such matters). It may also reflect the fact that Kant\nheld various broadly \u201cLeibnizian\u201d positions throughout the\npre-critical period, breaking rather substantively with Leibniz in the\nInaugural Dissertation of 1770. But this is not to say that Kant\nfocused exclusively on Leibniz and his followers in the Aesthetic. He\nalso presents two broad sorts of criticism of the Newtonian position.\nFirst, he criticizes the Newtonians for holding a transcendental\nrealist position concerning space and time\u2014his arguments against\ntranscendental realism presumably hold, if they are successful,\nagainst both the Leibnizian \u201cinherence\u201d view and the\nNewtonian \u201csubsistence\u201d view of space and time. Second, he\ncontends that their perspective, unlike Leibniz\u2019s, is marred by\na set of serious metaphysical problems. When discussing the Newtonian\nposition, Kant often emphasizes those problems. In \u00a77 of the\nAesthetic (in the B edition of 1787), Kant describes the\ntranscendental idealist conception of space and time, and then\ncharacterizes the relevant contrast class:\n\nThose, however, who assert the absolute reality [absolute\nRealit\u00e4t] of space and time, whether they take it to be\nsubsisting or only inhering, must themselves come into conflict with\nthe principles [Principien] of experience. For if they decide in favor\nof the first (which generally is the position of the mathematical\ninvestigators of nature), then they must assume two eternal and\ninfinite self-subsisting non-entities (space and time), which are\nthere (yet without there being anything actual) only in order to\ncomprehend everything actual within themselves.\n (A39/B56\u2013A40/B57)[25]\n\n\nKant contends that the Newtonians conceive of space as a kind of\nquasi-object. He seems to return here to the classical discussion of\nthe ontology of space mentioned at the outset of this entry. He\nemphasizes that on the Newtonian view, space and time are akin to\nsubstances\u2014in that they are independent of all objects and\nrelations, on the one hand, and independent of the mind (and of\nintuition), on the other\u2014and yet lack causal relations. They are\nalso imperceptible, and certainly in the case of space, infinite. Thus\nfor Kant, the Newtonians regard space as an infinite substance-like\nentity that is imperceptible and causally inert, a view that Kant\nregards as absurd on general metaphysical grounds. Numerous\nphilosophers throughout the eighteenth century, from Leibniz to\nBerkeley to Du Ch\u00e2telet, concurred. Kant adds that the Newtonian\nview seems to conflict with what he calls \u201cthe principles of\nexperience\u201d (see Shabel 2005, 46\u20137). Perhaps the idea behind\nthis second criticism can be discerned from Kant\u2019s comments\nelsewhere in the Critique and in the Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science\u2014in those texts, Kant notes\nthat absolute space is not an object of possible experience and that\none cannot prove its existence by appealing to\n experience.[26]\n In this way, Kant\u2019s criticisms of the Newtonian view seem to\nrest on very general metaphysical and epistemic\nconsiderations\u2014they seem to be largely divorced from the sort of\nspecific views of intuition and of representation that played a\nsubstantial role in Kant\u2019s criticisms of Leibniz.\n6. What is transcendental idealism?\n\nTranscendental idealism is obviously too complex to clarify simply by\ndiscussing Kant\u2019s views of space and time. A full discussion of\nit would have to range over his critical writings in metaphysics,\naesthetics, teleology, and ethics. But as we have seen, Kant himself\nindicates in the Transcendental Aesthetic that transcendental idealism\nis closely related to his conception of space and time, and so some\nclarity concerning Kant\u2019s overarching philosophical position can\nbe achieved in the context of this entry. The modus operandi,\nas above, will be to probe Kant\u2019s own discussions of the views\nof space and time articulated by his predecessors in order to clarify\nhis own position. In particular, Kant\u2019s remarks concerning\nBerkeley are especially helpful in this context, in addition to his\nremarks on Leibniz and Newton.\n6.1 Kant\u2019s criticisms of Berkeley\n\nWe have seen above that from Kant\u2019s point of view, both Leibniz\nand Newton\u2014and perhaps some of their followers\u2014defend\nversions of \u201ctranscendental realism.\u201d This is due to their\nsupport of the view\u2014or perhaps commitment to the view (on other\ngrounds)\u2014that space and time are independent of intuition in\nsome sense. They may also be adherents of this realist position on the\ngrounds that they do not articulate the view Kant defends in the\nMetaphysical Exposition, viz. that we have a non-empirical, singular,\nimmediate representation of space and time. But what does it mean for\nKant to say that space and time are somehow dependent on intuition?\nOne way of achieving some clarity in this domain is to fill out what\nKant regards as the relevant conceptual landscape by looking to his\ncharacterization of another idealist position, that of Berkeley (as he\nunderstands him). So suppose that space is not a property of objects\nindependent of intuition in any sense\u2014it does not even\nsupervene on properties of objects that are independent of\nintuition (recall that for Leibniz, space supervenes on the monadic\norder because objects and relations supervene on that order). On the\nview I want to consider, space does not supervene on properties of\nobjects that are independent of intuition because there are no such\nproperties. Suppose that space is indeed dependent on intuition, but\non empirical intuition. I take this to represent one\npossible construal of Berkeley\u2019s phrase, esse est\npercipii. This consideration suggests that, prima facie,\nKant should not interpret Berkeley as a transcendental realist. And if\nthat is right, what prevents Berkeley from being understood as a\ntranscendental idealist? Correlatively, what prevents one from\nunderstanding transcendental idealism as some kind of Berkeleyan\nidealism about space and time? These sorts of question can help to\nclarify what Kant understands by transcendental idealism, for\nKant seems to view Berkeley as a fellow idealist, but one who does not\ndefend a transcendental variety of this position.\n\nIronically, the view that Kant is\u2014perhaps despite his fervent\ndenials\u2014an idealist of the Berkeleyan variety arose in one of\nthe first critical appraisals of the Critique, the so-called\nGarve-Feder review of\n 1782.[27]\n In the Prolegomena, written directly after the review, Kant\n is concerned to distinguish his version of idealism from\n Berkeley\u2019s; one point he emphasizes hinges on their differing\n conceptions of space. In considering the question of why his early\n critics Garve and Feder interpreted him as a Berkeleyan idealist, he\n writes:\n\nThe solution to this difficulty rests upon something that could have\nbeen very easily seen from the context of the work, if one had wanted\nto. Space and time, along with what they contain, are not things, or\nproperties of things, in themselves, but belong merely to the\nappearances of such things; thus far I am in agreement with the\nprevious idealists. But these idealists, and among them especially\nBerkeley, saw space as a merely empirical representation, a\nrepresentation which, just like the appearances in space together with\nall of the determinations of space, would be known to us only by means\nof experience or perception; I show on the contrary, first, that space\n(and time too, to which Berkeley gave no attention), along with all\nits determinations, can be cognized by us a priori, for\nspace, as well as time, inheres in us before all perception or\nexperience as a pure form of our sensibility and makes possible all\nintuition from sensibility, and therefore all appearances (Ak 4:\n374\u20135).\n\n\nSo from Kant\u2019s point of view, Berkeley rejects transcendental\nrealism\u2014he rejects the notion that space is a thing in itself,\nor a property of things in\n themselves.[28]\n He presumably also rejects the idea that space and time are\nindependent of intuition. In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant admits\nthat one cannot \u201cblame\u201d Berkeley for falling into a\nradical version of idealism in an attempt to avoid the\n\u201cabsurdities\u201d of transcendental realism, absurdities into\nwhich Kant takes the Newtonians to have fallen (B70\u20131)\u2014these are\nthe very absurdities discussed above in the section on Kant\u2019s\ncriticisms of Newton. Kant seems to be suggesting with this remark\nthat Berkeley\u2014who was himself a fierce critic of the Newtonian\nidea of absolute or mathematical space\u2014defended the view that\nspace and time are dependent on intuition, that they are not\n\u201ctranscendentally real,\u201d in order to evade the Newtonian\nconception. And just before the Refutation of Idealism, Kant\nemphasizes again that Berkeley avoids transcendental realism\n(B274\u2014see Wilson 1999, 276\u201393). From Kant\u2019s point of view,\nBerkeley correctly avoids transcendental realism, but does so by\nfalsely claiming that space is dependent on empirical\nintuition. This is a mistake, as we have seen, because Kant thinks\nthat the representation of space cannot be empirical. It is precisely\nthis sort of view, in turn, that Kant cites when concluding that space\nmust be dependent on a priori intuition in some sense. So\nperhaps transcendental idealism is transcendental\u2014and\nnot merely idealist\u2014because it contains the view that\nour representation of space is non-empirical as an essential\ncomponent.\n\nWhat, then, of Kant\u2019s famous contention that endorsing\ntranscendental realism commits one to empirical idealism (A368\u20139)? It\nwould seem, prima facie, that Berkeley ought to be committed\nto empirical idealism, and yet Kant interprets him as\nrejecting transcendental realism. I take it that Berkeley\navoids transcendental realism, and therefore merely empirical\nidealism, by defending a more radical dogmatic idealism\n(B274\u20135). According to that view, there are no objects or properties\nthat are independent of\n intuition.[29]\n In contrast, Kant interprets the Leibnizians as thinking both that\nthe order of substances is transcendentally real, i.e. independent of\nintuition per se, and also as thinking that well-founded\nphenomena and their relations are not real\u2014the latter emerge\nfrom our misrepresentation of the underlying non-relational monadic\nreality. The phenomenal world of objects bearing spatial and causal\nrelations is merely ideal. It is perhaps in that sense that\nthe Leibnizians are committed to empirical\n idealism.[30]\n6.2 Conclusions\n\nThe reading (provided above) of what makes transcendental idealism\ntranscendental hints at a further way of clarifying\nKant\u2019s overarching position. His view is not just that space is\nnot a property of things independent of intuition per se, but\nthat space is not a property of things independent of a\npriori intuition. That distinguishes Kant\u2019s conception from\nthe idealism of a thinker like Berkeley, for Kant denies, as we have\nseen, the view that space is somehow dependent upon empirical\nintuition. This point, in turn, highlights a significant parallel\nbetween the first and second arguments of the Metaphysical Exposition\nand its third and fourth arguments. Just as the latter two arguments\nallow Kant to distinguish his idealism from Leibniz\u2019s based on\nthe notion that the representation of space is non-conceptual, the\nformer two arguments allow him to distinguish his idealism from\nBerkeley\u2019s based on the notion that the representation of space\nis non-empirical. Hence the \u201cdogmatic\u201d idealism of\nBerkeley and the \u201cempirical\u201d idealism of Leibniz are each\nruled out by considering the content and origin of the representation\nof space. That, at least, would seem to form part of Kant\u2019s\nintention in the Transcendental Aesthetic, especially in the\nMetaphysical Exposition. This indicates that Berkeleyan and Leibnizian\nidealist views can be construed as conceptions of the relation between\nspace and intuition. Whereas Berkeley takes space to be dependent on\nempirical intuition, Leibniz takes it to be independent of\nintuition per se. This illuminates Kant\u2019s concern in\nthe Transcendental Aesthetic with our representation of space:\nconsidering that representation in particular allows Kant to tackle\nother conceptions of the relation between space and intuition.\n\nFinally, transcendental idealism, in so far as it concerns space and\ntime, has the following essential component: we have a non-empirical,\nsingular, immediate representation of space. Part of Kant\u2019s\ninnovation is to introduce into the philosophical lexicon the very\nidea that we can have non-empirical intuition. It is improbable that\nwe can interpret this idea correctly unless we remind ourselves that\nKant rigorously distinguishes between sensation and intuition. That\ndistinction, in turn, forms a crucial component in Kant\u2019s\nextensive rejection of the Leibnizian doctrine of perception. It is\nonly with the rejection of that doctrine that we can understand\nKant\u2019s break with the Leibnizian view of space and time in the\nright light.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Hume, David, <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em>, edited by L.A.\nSelby-Bigge, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1888.", "Kant, Immanuel, <em>Kants gesammelte Schriften</em>, edited by\nK\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin: G.\nReimer, 1902\u2013", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, <em>Prolegomena zu einer jeden</em>\n<em>k\u00fcnftigen Metaphysik, die als Wissenschaft wird auftreten\nk\u00f6nnen</em>, edited by Karl Vorl\u00e4nder, Hamburg: Felix Meiner\nVerlag, 1920.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, <em>Kritik der Reinen Vernunft</em>, edited by\nRaymund Schmidt, Hamburg: Felix Meiner Verlag, 1956.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, <em>On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and\nthe Intelligible World</em> [<em>Inaugural Dissertation</em>], in\n<em>Theoretical Philosophy: 1755\u20131770</em>, translated by David\nWalford and Ralf Meerbote.
