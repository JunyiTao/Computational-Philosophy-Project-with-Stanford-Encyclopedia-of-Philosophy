    "main_text": "Expected Utility\n1. Expected Utility\n\nSuppose that a student is considering whether to study for an exam. He\nreasons that if he will pass the exam, then studying is wasted effort.\nAlso, if he will not pass the exam, then studying is wasted effort. He\nconcludes that because whatever will happen, studying is wasted\neffort, it is better not to study. This reasoning errs because\nstudying raises the probability of passing the exam. Deliberations\nshould take account of an act\u2019s influence on the probability of\nits possible outcomes.\nAn act\u2019s expected utility is a probability-weighted average\nof its possible outcomes\u2019 utilities. Possible states of the\nworld that are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive, and so form\na partition, generate an act\u2019s possible outcomes. An act-state\npair specifies an outcome. In the example, the act of studying and the\nstate of passing form an outcome comprising the effort of studying and\nthe benefit of passing. The expected utility of studying is the\nprobability of passing if one studies times the utility of studying\nand passing plus the probability of not passing if one studies times\nthe utility of studying and not passing. In compact notation,\n\n\\[\n\\textit{EU} (S) = P(P \\mbox{ if } S) \\util (S \\amp P) + P({\\sim}P \\mbox{ if } S) \\util (S \\amp{\\sim}P).\n\\] \n\n\nEach product specifies the probability and utility of a possible\noutcome. The sum is a probability-weighted average of the possible\noutcomes\u2019 utilities.\n\nHow should decision theory interpret the probability of a state \\(S\\)\nif one performs an act \\(A\\), that is, \\(P(S \\mbox{ if }A)\\)?\nProbability theory offers a handy suggestion. It has an account of\nconditional probabilities that decision theory may adopt. Decision\ntheory may take \\(P(S \\mbox{ if }A)\\) as the probability of the state\nconditional on the act. Then \\(P(S \\mbox{ if }A)\\) equals \\(P(S\\mid A)\\),\nwhich probability theory defines as \\(P(S \\amp A)/P(A)\\) when \\(P(A)\n\\ne 0\\). Some theorists call expected utility computed using\nconditional probabilities conditional expected utility. I call it\nexpected utility tout court because the formula using\nconditional probabilities generalizes a simpler formula for expected\nutility that uses nonconditional probabilities of states. Also, some\ntheorists call an act\u2019s expected utility its utility tout\ncourt because an act\u2019s expected utility appraises the act\nand yields the act\u2019s utility in ideal cases. I call it expected\nutility because a person by mistake may attach more or less utility to\na bet than its expected utility warrants. The equality of an\nact\u2019s utility and its expected utility is normative rather than\ndefinitional.\nExpected utilities obtained from conditional probabilities steer\nthe student\u2019s deliberations in the right\ndirection.\n\n\\[\\textit{EU} (S) = P(P\\mid S)\\util (S \\amp P) + P({\\sim}P\\mid S)\\util\n(S \\amp{\\sim}P), \\]\n\nand \n\n\\[\\textit{EU} ({\\sim}S) = P(P\\mid {\\sim}S)\\util ({\\sim}S \\amp P) +\nP({\\sim}P\\mid {\\sim}S)\\util ({\\sim}S \\amp{\\sim}P).\n\\] \n\n\nBecause of studying\u2019s effect on the probability of passing,\n\\(P(P\\mid S) \\gt P(P\\mid {\\sim}S)\\) and \\(P({\\sim}P\\mid S) \\lt\nP({\\sim}P\\mid {\\sim}S)\\). So \\(\\textit{EU} (S) \\gt \\textit{EU}\n({\\sim}S)\\), assuming that studying\u2019s increase in the\nprobability of passing compensates for the effort of\nstudying. Maximization of expected utility recommends studying.\n\nThe handy interpretation of the probability of a state if one performs\nan act, however, is not completely satisfactory. Suppose that one\ntosses a coin with an unknown bias and obtains heads. This result is\nevidence that the next toss will yield heads, although it does not\ncausally influence the next toss\u2019s result. An event\u2019s\nprobability conditional on another event indicates the evidence that\nthe second event provides for the first. If the two events are\ncorrelated, the second may provide evidence for the first without\ncausally influencing it. Causation entails correlation, but\ncorrelation does not entail causation. Deliberations should attend to\nan act\u2019s causal influence on a state rather than an act\u2019s\nevidence for a state. A good decision aims to produce a good outcome\nrather than evidence of a good outcome. It aims for the good and not\njust signs of the good. Often efficacy and auspiciousness go hand in\nhand. When they come apart, an agent should perform an efficacious act\nrather than an auspicious act.\n\nConsider the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, a stock example of game theory.\nTwo people isolated from each other may each act either cooperatively\nor uncooperatively. They each do better if they each act cooperatively\nthan if they each act uncooperatively. However, each does better if he\nacts uncooperatively, no matter what the other does. Acting\nuncooperatively dominates acting cooperatively. Suppose, in addition,\nthat the two players are psychological twins. Each thinks as the other\nthinks. Moreover, they know this fact about themselves. Then if one\nplayer acts cooperatively, he concludes that his counterpart also acts\ncooperatively. His acting cooperatively is good evidence that his\ncounterpart does the same. Nonetheless, his acting cooperatively does\nnot cause his counterpart to act cooperatively. He has no contact with\nhis counterpart. Because he is better off not acting cooperatively\nwhatever his counterpart does, not acting cooperatively is the better\ncourse. Acting cooperatively is auspicious but not efficacious.\n\nTo make expected utility track efficacy rather than auspiciousness,\ncausal decision theory interprets the probability of a state if one\nperforms an act as a type of causal probability rather than as a\nstandard conditional probability. In the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma with\ntwins, consider the probability of one player\u2019s acting\ncooperatively given that the other player does. This conditional\nprobability is high. Next, consider the causal probability of one\nplayer\u2019s acting cooperatively if the other player does. Because\nthe players are isolated, this probability equals the probability of\nthe first player\u2019s acting cooperatively. It is low if that\nplayer follows dominance. Using conditional probabilities, the\nexpected utility of acting cooperatively exceeds the expected utility\nof acting uncooperatively. However, using causal probabilities, the\nexpected utility of acting uncooperatively exceeds the expected\nutility of acting cooperatively. Switching from conditional to causal\nprobabilities makes expected-utility maximization yield acting\nuncooperatively.\n",
