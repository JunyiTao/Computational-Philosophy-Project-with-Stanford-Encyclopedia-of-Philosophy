    "main_text": "Arguments for Disjunctivism || Further Motivations for Disjunctivism\n3.6 Further Motivations for Disjunctivism\n\n\nThis section briefly summarises some further considerations that\nhave been appealed to in motivating disjunctive accounts of perceptual\nexperience.\n\n\nSome have argued that a genuine perception of the world is a\nperceptual state with an intentional content containing demonstrative\nelements that refer to the items perceived. (See Brewer 2000, Burge\n1993, and Tye 2007, Scellenberg 2010, 2013, and 2016. For objections\nto this idea see Davies 1992 and McGinn 1982.) Acceptance of this\nview, together with two further assumptions, can lead to the\nconclusion that the kind of experience that occurs when one perceives\nthe world isn\u2019t one that can occur when one hallucinates, which\nin turn can motivate a disjunctive approach to perceptual experience\nin general. The two further assumptions are the following. (a)\nTruth-evaluable intentional contents with demonstrative elements that\nsuccessfully refer are object-dependent, and (b) experiences are of\nthe same mental kind only if they have the same truth-evaluable\ncontents. (The latter claim is endorsed by Evans 1981, 1982 and\nMcDowell 1984. For criticisms of this claim see Burge 1983, 1993,\n2005, 2010, and Martin 2003).\n\n\nBrewer advocated a view of this form in his book Perception and\nReason. In his more recent work on perceptual experience he has\nproposed an alternative view of genuine perception, but which also\ncommits to disjunctivism about perceptual experience. (See Brewer\n2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2017a, and 2017b.) In this work Brewer is\nconcerned to identify and defend the account of experience that he\nthinks is most conducive to our common sense \u2018empirical\nrealist\u2019 world-view\u2014the view that the tables, trees,\npeople and animals etc, that we sense, are as they are independently\nof anyone\u2019s thought or experience of them. Brewer argues that\nthe \u2018Object View\u2019 of experience, which he contrasts with\nthe \u2018Content View\u2019, is the most promising such\naccount. According to this \u2018object view\u2019, perception is an\nacquaintance with mind-independent empirical things whose basic\nnatures and perceptible qualities constitute what it is like to be\npresented with them in this way. A similar line of empirical realist\nline of thought can be found in Campbell\u2019s work. (For example,\nsee Campbell and Cassam 2014. For a related line of thought, see also\nLogue 2012b). Campbell argues that only a na\u00efve realist account of the\nphenomenal character of perception can accommodate an epistemic role\nthat conscious perception plays in grounding the concepts we possess\nof mind-independent objects and the qualities we perceive. For\nexample, he argues that only a na\u00efve realist account of phenomenal\ncharacter can adequately capture the following two ideas: (i) The\nphenomenal character of perception plays a crucial role in explaining\nour distinctive conceptions of what our colour terms refer to, and\n(ii) our colour terms refer to mind-independent qualities of\nobjects. (For discussion of Campbell\u2019s view, see Soteriou 2016,\nCh. 4. For objections to Campbell\u2019s arguments, see\nCassam\u2019s contribution to Campbell and Cassam 2014. For\nobjections to the view of colour defended by Campbell, see Pautz\nforthcoming. For further discussion of this issue, see Kalderon 2011,\nAllen 2016, and Beck 2019).\n\n\nOne significant recent source of motivation for disjunctivism (common\nto the views proposed by Martin, Campbell and Brewer) is the\nsuggestion that we should moving away from representationalist\naccounts of the way in which our minds are intentionally directed upon\nthe mind-independent world when we perceive it. Influential in this\nregard is Charles Travis\u2019s work on perception. Travis (2004 and\n2013), who cites Austin\u2019s Sense and Sensibilia as an\nimportant influence, argues that perception is not\nrepresentational. He offers a critique of a representationalist view\nthat is committed to the following claims: (i) Experiences have\nrepresentational contents and can be true / false\u2014veridical\n/non-veridical; (ii) the representational content of an experience is\nsomething that the subject can take at face value, and accept, or\ndecline; (iii) the experience having this content isn\u2019t a matter\nof the subject taking / judging things to be a certain way; and (iv)\nthe way our experience represents things to be is something we can\nappreciate and recognize. According to Travis\u2019s alternative view\nof perception our senses confront us with what is there, they bring\nour surroundings into view, but there is nothing in a perceptual\nexperience to make it count as having some one representational\ncontent as opposed to countless others. In making out, or trying to\nmake out what it is that we are confronted with,\nwe may go wrong, and make false judgements, but when we are\nmisled in this way, this is not because our senses non-veridically\nrepresent to us that the world is a certain way. On the assumption\nthat we are not confronted with the mind-independent world when we\nhallucinate, this sort of view naturally leads to a disjunctivist view\nof perceptual experience. (For discussion of these issues, see Raleigh\n2013, Shahmoradi 2016, and Wilson 2018).\n",
