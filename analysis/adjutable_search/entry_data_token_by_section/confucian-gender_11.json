For instance, even under the non-gendered virtue of\n\u201cpersuasive and communicative\u201d (biantong) where\nwomen in early antiquity were celebrated as skillful rhetoricians\nturning a precarious situation in their favor through the sheer power\nof persuasion, the narratives of these skillful women rhetoricians\nwere still told in the context of or their servitude to\npatrilineage.\n\nTake for example the opening biography of Ch. 6, Lien\u00fc\nzhuan 6.1: \u201cGuan Zhong of Qi\u2019s Concubine,\nJing\u201d. Jing was a skillful rhetorician who successfully helped\nGuan Zhong (c. 720\u2014645 BCE)\u2014the famed prime minister of\nQi\u2014decipher the opaque speech of Ning Qi. Guan Zhong was under\nthe Duke\u2019s directive to gauge Ning Qi\u2019s intention to\nserve, and yet during their encounter Ning Qi only uttered the phrase\n\u201cHow vast, the white water\u201d which had vexed Guan Zhong for\nfive days. Upon seeing Guan Zhong\u2019s vexation, Jing, the\nconcubine, offered her help to lessen his burden, but was quickly\ndismissed as nothing that she would understand. Jing was obviously\nerudite, since she was able to place Ning Qi\u2019s speech of\n\u201cHow vast, the white water\u201d in the context of an old\nOde signaling Ning Qi\u2019s willingness to serve the Duke.\nThe story ended with a praise of Guan Zhong\u2019s recommendation of\nNing Qi to the Duke who then was able to secure the means to good\ngovernance. It is clear that even though Jing was as erudite as Ning\nQi, one was offered the position of a minister and the other remained\na lowly concubine who had to persuade Guan Zhong not to take her lowly\nstatus as the ground to dismiss her ability to help him in the first\nplace. The most a talented woman could do was to be of service to the\nmen of her kin who then were memorialized for their achievements in\nthe wai.\n",
