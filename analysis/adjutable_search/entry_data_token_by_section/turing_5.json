Building a Brain\n\n\nThe provocative words \u2018building a brain\u2019 from the outset\nannounced the relationship of Turing's technical computer engineering\nto a philosophy of Mind. Even in 1936, Turing had given an\ninterpretation of computability in terms of \u2018states of\nmind\u2019. His war work had shown the astounding power of the\ncomputable in mechanising expert human procedures and judgments. From\n1941 onwards, Turing had also discussed the mechanisation of\nchess-playing and other \u2018intelligent\u2019 activities with his\ncolleagues at Bletchley Park (Hodges 1983, p. 213). But more\nprofoundly, it appears that Turing emerged in 1945 with a conviction\nthat computable operations were sufficient to embrace all\nmental functions performed by the brain. As will become clear from the\nensuing discussion, the uncomputable \u2018intuition\u2019 of 1938\ndisappeared from Turing's thought, and was replaced by new ideas all\nlying within the realm of the computable. This change shows even in the\ntechnical prospectus of (Turing 1946), where Turing referred to the\npossibility of making a machine calculate chess moves, and then\ncontinued: \nThis \u2026 raises the question \u2018Can a machine play\nchess?\u2019 It could fairly easily be made to play a rather bad game.\nIt would be bad because chess requires intelligence. We stated \u2026\nthat the machine should be treated as entirely without intelligence.\nThere are indications however that it is possible to make the machine\ndisplay intelligence at the risk of its making occasional serious\nmistakes. By following up this aspect the machine could probably be\nmade to play very good chess.\n\n\nThe puzzling reference to \u2018mistakes\u2019 is made clear by a\ntalk Turing gave a year later (Turing 1947), in which the issue of\nmistakes is linked to the issue of the significance of seeing the truth\nof formally unprovable statements.\n\u2026I would say that fair play must be given to the\nmachine. Instead of it giving no answer we could arrange that it gives\noccasional wrong answers. But the human mathematician would likewise\nmake blunders when trying out new techniques\u2026 In other words\nthen, if a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be\nintelligent. There are several mathematical theorems which say almost\nexactly that. But these theorems say nothing about how much\nintelligence may be displayed if a machine makes no pretence at\ninfallibility.\n\n\nTuring's post-war view was that mathematicians make mistakes, and so\ndo not in fact see the truth infallibly. Once the possibility of\nmistakes is admitted, G\u00f6del's theorem become irrelevant.\nMathematicians and computers alike apply computable processes to the\nproblem of judging the correctness of assertions; both will therefore\nsometimes err, since seeing the truth is known not to be a computable\noperation, but there is no reason why the computer need do worse than\nthe mathematician. This argument is still very much alive. For\ninstance, Davis (2000) endorses Turing's view and attacks Penrose\n(1989, 1990, 1994, 1996) who argues against the significance of human\nerror on the grounds of a Platonist account of mathematics.\n\n\nTuring also pursued more constructively the question of how\ncomputers could be made to perform operations which did not appear to\nbe \u2018mechanical\u2019 (to use common parlance). His guiding\nprinciple was that it should be possible to simulate the operation of\nhuman brains. In an unpublished report (Turing 1948), Turing explained\nthat the question was that of how to simulate \u2018initiative\u2019\nin addition to \u2018discipline\u2019\u2014comparable to the need\nfor \u2018intuition\u2019 as well as mechanical ingenuity expressed\nin his pre-war work. He announced ideas for how to achieve this: he\nthought \u2018initiative\u2019 could arise from systems where the\nalgorithm applied is not consciously designed, but is arrived at by\nsome other means. Thus, he now seemed to think that the mind when\nnot actually following any conscious rule or plan, was\nnevertheless carrying out some computable process.\n\n\nHe suggested a range of ideas for systems which could be said to\nmodify their own programs. These ideas included nets of logical\ncomponents (\u2018unorganised machines\u2019) whose properties could\nbe \u2018trained\u2019 into a desired function. Thus, as expressed\nby (Ince 1989), he predicted neural networks. However, Turing's nets\ndid not have the \u2018layered\u2019 structure of the neural\nnetworks that were to be developed from the 1950s onwards. By the\nexpression \u2018genetical or evolutionary search\u2019, he also\nanticipated the \u2018genetic algorithms\u2019 which since the late\n1980s have been developed as a less closely structured approach to\nself-modifying programs. Turing's proposals were not well developed in\n1948, and at a time when electronic computers were only barely in\noperation, could not have been. Copeland and Proudfoot (1996) have\ndrawn fresh attention to Turing\u2019s connectionist ideas, which\nhave since been tried out (Teuscher 2001).\n\n\nIt is important to note that Turing identified his prototype neural\nnetworks and genetic algorithms as computable. This has to be\nemphasised since the word \u2018nonalgorithmic\u2019 is often now\nconfusingly employed for computer operations that are not explicitly\nplanned. Indeed, his ambition was explicit: he himself wanted to\nimplement them as programs on a computer. Using the term Universal\nPractical Computing Machine for what is now called a digital computer,\nhe wrote in (Turing 1948):\nIt should be easy to make a model of any particular machine\nthat one wishes to work on within such a UPCM instead of having to work\nwith a paper machine as at present. If one also decided on quite\ndefinite \u2018teaching policies\u2019 these could also be programmed\ninto the machine. One would then allow the whole system to run for an\nappreciable period, and then break in as a kind of \u2018inspector of\nschools\u2019 and see what progress had been made. One might also be\nable to make some progress with unorganised\nmachines\u2026\n\n\nThe upshot of this line of thought is that all mental operations are\ncomputable and hence realisable on a universal machine: the\ncomputer. Turing advanced this view with increasing confidence in the\nlate 1940s, perfectly aware that it represented what he enjoyed calling\n\u2018heresy\u2019 to the believers in minds or souls beyond material\ndescription.\n\n\nTuring was not a mechanical thinker, or a stickler for convention;\nfar from it. Of all people, he knew the nature of originality and\nindividual independence. Even in tackling the U-boat Enigma problem,\nfor instance, he declared that he did so because no-one else was\nlooking at it and he could have it to himself. Far from being trained\nor organised into this problem, he took it on despite the prevailing\nwisdom in 1939 that it was too difficult to attempt. His arrival at a\nthesis of \u2018machine intelligence\u2019 was not the outcome of\nsome dull or restricted mentality, or a lack of appreciation of\nindividual human creativity.\n",
