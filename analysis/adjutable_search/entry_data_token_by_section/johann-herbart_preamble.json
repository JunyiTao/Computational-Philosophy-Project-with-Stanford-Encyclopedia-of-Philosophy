    "main_text": "\nJohann Friedrich Herbart (1776\u20131841) is known today mainly as a founding figure\nof modern psychology and educational theory. But these were only parts\nof a much grander philosophical project, and it was as a philosopher\nof the first rank that his contemporaries saw him. Even in his own\nday, Herbart\u2019s direct influence on academic philosophy was\nlimited, but this had as much to do with shifting disciplinary borders\nas with his polemics against the German Idealists. In psychology and\npedagogy, however, his influence was greater and longer lasting. While\nno one took over his philosophy or psychology (and especially the\nimpenetrable mathematics) as a whole, certain aspects of his thought\nproved immensely fruitful. Indeed, without Herbart, the landscape of\nmodern psychology and philosophy would be unrecognizable.\nThough his mathematization of the mind proved a dead end, it\nencouraged early experimentalists like Fechner to apply mathematics to\nthe psyche. His interpretation of space had an important influence on\nHelmholtz\u2019s empirical theory of vision, and on Natorp\u2019s\n\u201clogicization\u201d of Kantian spatio-temporal intuition.\nHerbart\u2019s arguments against psychological faculties were taken\nover by Wundt, and his notions of the limen and the\n\u201csubconscious\u201d were fundamental to Freud\u2019s\npsychoanalytic theory. In philosophy, Herbart anticipated key ideas of\nPhenomenology, such as Brentano\u2019s conception of mental\nphenomena, and his ideas of representational force,\nthe limen, and reproduction all find positive endorsement and\ndevelopment in Husserl\u2019s Phenomenology. Finally, recent\nscholarship in both psychology and philosophy is rediscovering\nHerbart. For example, Boudewijnse et al.  argue not only for the\ncontemporary relevance of Herbart\u2019s psycho-mechanics, but also\nthat it is supported by experiment. And Beiser\u2019s important\ncontribution to the early history of neo-Kantianism reveals Herbart as\na radical and important interpreter of Kant.\n",
