At first glance, facts of all sorts inside metaphysics and out\nseem to at least in principle admit of metaphysical explanation. In\nthis section, we discuss recent applications in ethics, philosophy of\nmind, and philosophy of social science respectively.\n\nFirst, ethics. In Plato\u2019s Euthyphro, the eponymous\nEuthyphro is asked by Socrates to consider the following question: Is\nthat which is pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it\npious because it is loved by the gods? (Euthyphro 10a). This\nis a very early example of a request for a metaphysical explanation,\nfor the connection between piety and being loved by the gods imagined\nin the second horn does not seem to be a causal connection, but a\nconstitutive one (although what Plato means by \u201cbecause\u201d\nin the first horn, and the overall structure of Plato\u2019s\nargument, remains controversial). Requests for explanation abound in\nmoral philosophy: one of the key aims of first-order moral philosophy\nis to explain why the right actions are right and the wrong\nones are wrong (Fogal & Risberg 2020), and of metaethics is to\nsystematize those explanations. Fine (2012: 37) distinguishes between\nthree different explanatory relations: metaphysical, normative, and\nnatural, apparently suggesting that normative explanations and\nmetaphysical explanations are different kinds of explanation. However,\nexplanations in the moral realm (e.g., that an action is bad because\nit causes pain, or that something has intrinsic value just in case it\nis valuable in virtue of its intrinsic properties) are often\nconsidered paradigm cases of metaphysical explanations. Berker (2018),\nwho is a unionist, argues at length that it is metaphysical grounding\n(and thus metaphysical explanation) that is at issue in moral\nphilosophy.\n\nSecond, philosophy of mind. Although there has been limited systematic\ndiscussion of metaphysical explanation in the area, considerations\nabout metaphysical explanation inform some of the most fundamental\nquestions in the discipline, such as how it could be the case that\nconsciousness exists. It is fairly common for the grounding literature\nto mention by way of elucidation of the notion of grounding that we\nmight think of mental facts as grounded in the physical facts. This\nexample is supposed to be compelling because of the attractiveness of\nthe idea that physical facts determine and metaphysically explain the\nmental facts, and grounding is a prima facie appealing notion\nwith which to characterize the relationship between the mental and the\nphysical precisely because of its explanatory nature. This idea is\nmade more precise in the development of grounding physicalism\n(see, e.g., Ney 2016; O\u2019Conaill 2018; Rabin forthcoming-a,\nforthcoming-b; Schaffer 2021), though this new version of physicalism\nhas not been met with universal approval (see, e.g., Melnyk 2016; J.\nWilson 2018).\n\nFor physicalists in the philosophy of mind who maintain that the\nmental is grounded in, supervenient on, or identical with the\nphysical, there is a pressing need to explain what makes it the case\nthat some particular phenomenal feel should be associated with a given\nphysical state (see, e.g., Chalmers 1996; Levine 2001). This\nexplanatory gap is an epistemic one, and so there are two ways we\nmight proceed. The first is to insist that unless the explanatory gap\nhas been closed, we do not have a metaphysical explanation of the\nmental in terms of the physical. The second is to allow that we might\nhave a metaphysical explanation without a corresponding epistemic one.\nSchaffer (2017) argues that grounding, and the metaphysical laws that\nprovide the framework for grounding, close the explanatory gap between\nthe mental and the physical (and many more besides). Rabin (2019)\ndisagrees, claiming that the gap between consciousness and physical\nfundamentalia has a special status, persisting even if we grant that\nthe former is metaphysically explained by the latter.\n\nThird, philosophy of social science. Theorizing about the nature of\nsocial reality at least partly involves metaphysically explaining\nsocial reality. Debates between (methodological) holists and\nindividualists, for example, concern whether social activities and\nevents are to be explained by appeal to macro-level (social)\nphenomena, or by the thoughts and actions of the individuals that,\nmost agree, make up or ground those social phenomena (see, e.g.,\nPopper 1945; Watkins 1952). The metaphysically explanatory nature of\nsocial theorizing has not always been appreciated. This is brought out\nin the distinction between explanatory and ontological individualism\n(Lukes 1968). Explanatory individualism is the thesis that social\nreality is best explained in terms of individuals, their thoughts and\ninteractions. Ontological individualism, on the other hand, holds that\nsocial reality consists in or is exhaustively determined by\nindividuals, their thoughts and interactions. If, however, social\nreality is or is grounded in individuals and their interactions,\nsocial reality is metaphysically explained by those individuals and\ntheir interactions (Epstein 2015). Both these theses are theses about\nexplanation.\n\nMetaphysical explanation is also relevant when considering the\nexistence and nature of social kinds. According to Haslanger (2012),\nfor example, being a woman amounts to occupying a certain (subordinate\nand hence oppressed) position in a social hierarchy. This type of view\ngives rise to Euthyphro-like queries of the kind: is x a\nwoman because she occupies a certain position in an oppressive\nstructure, or does she occupy this position because she is a woman?\n(see \u00c1sta 2010). According to some philosophers involved in\nthis debate, how you answer this question will decide if your account\nis realist (Barnes 2017) or deflationist (D\u00edaz-Le\u00f3n\n2018). Haslanger herself has argued that the account is best\nunderstood as something in between. Against the\n\u201cdeflationists\u201d, she is an extensionalist about meaning,\nfrom which it follows that it would make no sense to say that we have\nto sort out what the word means before determining its extension.\nAgainst the realists, Haslanger sometimes talks as if she rejects the\nidea that reality is hierarchically structured and holds instead that\nthe natural world is neither explanatorily prior to nor ontologically\nmore fundamental than the social world (pace, e.g., Schaffer\n2017).\n",
