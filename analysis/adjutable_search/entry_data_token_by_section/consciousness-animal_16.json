    "main_text": "Evolution and Distribution of Consciousness || Mammals\n6.3 Mammals\nA variety of theoretical and empirical arguments have been put\nforward to the effect that consciousness is shared across all\nmammals. Seth, Baars and Edelman (2005) argue that the neural\nprocesses essential to human conscious \u2014 widespread reentrant\nactivity in the thalamo-cortical complex \u2014 involve anatomical\nsystems that are shared among all mammals (and perhaps more\nwidely). Panksepp (reviewed in 2005) takes a similar approach,\nalthough focusing on the neurophysiological systems involved in the\n\u2018core emotions\u2019. Although in both of the above proposals,\nthe authors acknowledge that consciousness may be more widespread than\njust mammals, they argue that in the case of mammals, the weight of\nevidence based on homology of relevant neurophysiological systems is\noverwhelming, whereas outside of mammals, the inference is more\ntenuous because of the biological differences in non-mammalian\nanimals. Further, it should be kept in mind that all of the following\nproposals imply that consciousness is widely shared among\nmammals. Hence, the position that all mammals are conscious is widely\nagreed upon among scientists who express views on the distribution of\nconsciousness.\n",
