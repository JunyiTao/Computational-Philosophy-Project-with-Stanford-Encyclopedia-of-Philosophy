    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nShe was born in Limerick, Ireland 18 March 1919 to Allen Wells\nAnscombe and Gertrude Elizabeth Anscombe (n\u00e9e Thomas). At the\ntime of her birth her father was serving in the British Army. The\nfamily later returned to England where her father resumed his career\nas a schoolmaster, while her mother, a classical scholar, worked as a\nheadmistress.\n\nAn inquisitive child, Anscombe decided to convert to Roman Catholicism\nin her early teens. She attended the Sydenham School, graduating in\n1937, and went on to St. Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford. During her\nearly years at Oxford she met three young women who also had\nremarkable careers in philosophy: Iris Murdoch, Mary Midgley, and,\nabove all, Philippa Foot, with whom she developed a deep friendship\nher entire life (Mac Cumhaill & Wiseman 2022). Anscombe received a\nFirst in Literae Humaniores (Classics and Philosophy) in 1941. After\nher graduation she remained at St. Hugh\u2019s as a research student,\nand in 1942 moved to Newnham College, Cambridge, where she met Ludwig\nWittgenstein. She believed that attending Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlectures freed her from the trap of phenomenalism that had so plagued\nher (MPM, ix). In 1946 she was offered a Research Fellowship at\nSomerville College, Oxford, and was appointed to a teaching Fellowship\nthere in 1964. She moved from Oxford to Cambridge in 1970 when she was\nawarded a Chair of Philosophy at Cambridge \u2013 the Chair formerly\noccupied by Wittgenstein. She remained at Cambridge until her\nretirement in 1986.\n\nIn 1938, at Oxford, she met the philosopher Peter Geach, who then was\nstudying at Balliol. They were both receiving instruction from the\nsame Dominican priest. They were married in 1941, and had three sons\nand four daughters.\n\nIn 1948, the young Anscombe read a paper [CSL] to the Socratic Club\nattacking an argument offered by C. S. Lewis in his book\nMiracles. In Chapter 3 of that book Lewis argued that\nnaturalism is self-refuting. Lewis attended her talk, and, although\naccounts vary, some acquaintances report that he was crushed by her\nwithering criticism. In any case, Lewis significantly rewrote the\nrelevant chapter in the subsequent edition of his book.\n\nAnscombe also became one of Wittgenstein\u2019s good friends and\nthen, after his death in 1951, the chief translator of his work into\nEnglish. Ray Monk wrote that Anscombe was \u201c\u2026one of\nWittgenstein\u2019s closest friends and one of his most trusted\nstudents, an exception to his general dislike of academic women and\nespecially of female philosophers.\u201d (Monk 1991, 498).\n\nAnscombe did not avoid controversy. In 1956 she publicly opposed\nOxford University\u2019s decision to award an honorary degree to\nHarry Truman, whom she considered a murderer for intentionally killing\nthe civilians of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. She also courted\ncontroversy by coming out in print against contraception (see below),\nand engaging in civil disobedience at abortion clinics.\n\nAnscombe famously flouted gender conventions: she did not take her\nhusband\u2019s name, she frequently wore men\u2019s clothes, she\nsmoked cigars, and she was prone to cursing and vulgar speech.\nAlthough influenced by several men \u2013 Frege, Wittgenstein, Geach,\nvarious Catholic thinkers historical and contemporaneous \u2013\nAnscombe was a fiercely independent and original philosopher. Those\nwho suspect she merely echoed or applied the views of another person\nare sorely mistaken.\n\nAnscombe continued to produce original work beyond her retirement.\nPeter Geach, for example, reported in Analysis that she had\nconstructed a novel paradox late in life (Geach 2006,\n266\u20137).\n\nAnscombe died in Cambridge on 5 January 2001.\n2. Moral and Political Philosophy\n\nAnscombe\u2019s philosophical work does not form a system. But\nunderstanding her thoughts in moral and political philosophy helps one\ngrasp some of her wider philosophical motivations, especially those on\nthe topics of action and intention. We will first discuss several of\nher most well-known papers in moral and political philosophy, for this\nwill shed light on her interest in these other areas.\n\nIn her infamous pamphlet \u201cMr. Truman\u2019s Degree\u201d (MTD)\n(1958), Anscombe protested Oxford\u2019s decision to award Harry\nTruman an honorary doctorate. Some of the ideas in this pamphlet were\nlater developed in \u201cWar and Murder\u201d (WAM) (1972), written\nfor a Christian venue.\n\nShe opposed Oxford\u2019s decision to honor Truman on the grounds\nthat Truman was a murderer. He was a murderer, because \u201cchoosing\nto kill the innocent as a means to your ends is always murder\u201d\n(MTD, 66). The people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were by and large\nnoncombatants, neither fighting the Allies nor supplying Japan with\nthe means of fighting them. She argued that killing these innocent\npeople seemed necessary only because the Allies stupidly insisted that\nJapan unconditionally surrender.\n\nOne defense of Truman that she mentions and briefly opposes goes like\nthis: Truman didn\u2019t really kill anybody; he merely\nsigned a piece of paper. Another goes like this: if killing innocent\npeople were really murderous, then it would be murderous to kill enemy\nsoldiers while they are sleeping, for at that moment they aren\u2019t\nharming anyone (MTD, 67). Both of these moves rest on an implicit view\nof what action (e.g. killing, harming) is. Opposing this view of\naction motivated Anscombe\u2019s own later work on action and\nintention, discussed below in Section 4.\n\nIn WAM, Anscombe wrote at greater length about the difference between\nmurdering and other forms of killing. She distinguished choosing to\nkill the innocent as a means to your end, which is always murder, from\nchoosing to do something else which you know as a statistical\ncertainty will kill the innocent. Bombing civilian populations in\norder to provoke surrender is clearly a case of the former. The\nlatter might or might not also be murder \u2013 it depends upon some\ndetails. It\u2019s possible to administer a drug to alleviate the\nhorrid pain of someone in mortal illness, knowing full well that,\nalas, the patient will thereby die sooner, but not thereby murder your\npatient. The patient\u2019s death might not have been your end, nor a\nmeans to any such end. This difference in an action\u2019s\nstructure bears upon whether it constitutes murder. That is,\nwhat makes some forms of killing murder is not our opposition to it,\nnor the fact that it is unjust or wrong. Rather, some forms of killing\nare aptly described as murder, which we then might condemn\nand oppose.\n\nIn WAM, Anscombe also argued that human society is essential to human\ngood, that the state is necessary for such society, and thus the state\nmust have some right to use even deadly violence against those who\nattack it. (She defends some of these claims in greater detail in\nSAS.) But while pacifism is misguided, so too is the view that the\nstate or its officers may do anything to defend itself. Killing is\nsometimes unjust, sometimes not. But warriors and police are often\ntempted to kill even those who are not unjustly attacking it, and, she\nholds, to kill the innocent deliberately is always murder, and,\nmoreover, murder is always unjust.\n\nTo kill someone deliberately, she notes, is to kill someone either for\nits own sake or as a means to some further end. Such killing is\nintentional. By contrast, Anscombe claims that the distinction between\nthe intended and the merely foreseen is \u201cabsolutely\nessential\u201d to Christian ethics. Some actions (e.g. murder)\nChristian ethics always prohibits or forbids, and intentional killing\nof the innocent is on this list.\n\nSome people had instead held that one can direct one\u2019s\nintentions a certain way to achieve the desired result with moral\nimpunity. If, for example, one tells oneself that by doing y\none is really only intending x, then one is off the hook,\neven if y is forbidden.\n\nThe devout Catholic bomber secures by a \u201cdirection of\nintention\u201d that any shedding of innocent blood that occurs is\n\u201caccidental.\u201d I know a Catholic boy who was puzzled at\nbeing told by his schoolmaster that it was an accident that\nthe people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were there to be killed; in fact,\nhowever absurd it seems, such thoughts are common among priests who\nknow that they are forbidden by the divine law to justify the direct\nkilling of the innocent (WAM, 59).\n\n\nThis teaching strikes Anscombe as quite absurd. She chalks this\nmisunderstanding up to \u201cCartesian\u201d psychology, a\nphilosophy of psychology she works to oppose elsewhere.\n\nA philosophical understanding of intention (and thus not just Catholic\ndoctrine) is needed to show that killing innocent people as a\nmeans to ending a war (or whatever) just is intentionally\nkilling the innocent, despite whatever thoughts are running through\nthe mind of the killer at the time. Thus she argues for a proper\nunderstanding of Aquinas\u2019s idea that it matters whether some\naction\u2019s effect is intended or merely foreseen, something we\nmust grasp if we are to see what motivates the Principle or Doctrine\nof Double Effect (See SEP entry for more about the pros and cons of\nthe Doctrine of Double Effect). Anscombe does not so much argue for\nthe principle, as insist that it has not been adequately understood.\nSo to defend the Principle of Double Effect, a principle of ethics, we\nfirst need a sound understanding of the concepts of action and of\nintention. More on this in Section 4.\n\nWe will see the same need to understand the concepts of action and\nintention by studying her most well-known paper, \u201cModern Moral\nPhilosophy\u201d (MMP). There Anscombe presses three theses. First,\ndoing moral philosophy is useless, and will remain so until we have an\nadequate philosophy of psychology, which is a long way away. Second,\nmoral philosophers in any case should abandon the concepts of moral\nobligation, moral duty, and the moral \u201cought\u201d, for these\nconcepts make sense only in several conceptions of ethics none of\nwhich generally survives. Third, there are no important differences\namong the well-known English moral philosophers from Sidgwick onwards.\nEach of Anscombe\u2019s three theses is bold; taken together, they\nare shocking.\n\nWe will start with her last thesis. Anscombe notes that despite their\nmany differences, \u201cevery one of the best known English academic\nmoral philosophers\u201d thinks that killing the innocent is\nsometimes right, such as when the foreseeable consequences of\nnot killing them would be catastrophic. She traces this to\nSidgwick\u2019s definition of intention, according to which one\nintends any and every foreseen consequence of one\u2019s\nvoluntary action. While the moral philosophers she criticizes\ndon\u2019t necessarily accept Sidgwick\u2019s definition of\nintention, they do accept an ethical thesis based upon it: a person is\nalways equally responsible for the intended and the merely\nforeseeable consequences of their voluntary actions. Anscombe\nidentifies this move as the difference between the\nUtilitarianism of John Stuart Mill, who rejected the thought that it\ncould ever be apt to calculate whether to kill an innocent person, and\nthe consequentialism (a term she invented) of later English\nphilosophers. Consequentialism, as she explains, is not directly a\ndoctrine about what makes an action right \u2013 this meaning came\nabout only later in the recent history of philosophy. Instead,\nconsequentialism is about what one is responsible for. But the two\ntopics are connected: if you are equally responsible for intentionally\nkilling innocent people and for merely foreseeably killing innocent\npeople, then why would it be wrong to kill one innocent person to save\nfive? For if you don\u2019t, you\u2019d be just as responsible for\nthe death of the five as if you had killed them yourself. Thus even\nmany deontologists (like W.D. Ross) agree with Sidgwick that in some\ncircumstances you have a moral duty to kill innocent people. (See also\nMTD, 71.) But Anscombe instead held that the consequentialist view of\nresponsibility ultimately rests on a false view of what it is to act\nintentionally.\n\nHere and elsewhere, MMP touched a nerve with the philosophers she\ntargeted. One reason for this was the rather dismissive tone she took\nin some of her criticisms. Another is her rich use of irony. In\naddition to criticizing her contemporaries, she brusquely and perhaps\nuncharitably attacks Butler, Hume, Kant, Bentham, and Mill. One might\nsometimes guess that Anscombe is complaining about her colleagues\nbecause they favor new radical ideas, preferring philosophy that\nleaves everything in its place. But in fact she criticizes them on the\ngrounds that the standards from which they begin are, in practice, the\nones that happen to be current in their own society, and so modern\nmoral philosophers wind up being very conventional. This was also the\nthrust of her BBC radio lecture \u201cDoes Oxford Moral Philosophy\nCorrupt the Youth?\u201d, which she answered in the negative, on the\ngrounds that English culture was already corrupt, and\ncontemporary moral philosophy merely reflected rather than generated\nor opposed this turpitude.\n\nThe second thesis of MMP is that moral philosophers ought to abandon\nthe concepts of moral obligation, moral duty,\nmoral \u201cought\u201d, and the like. (The generic\n\u2018ought\u2019 is fine.) These concepts, Anscombe argues, have a\npoint only in a law-based ethics: if a moral legislator (e.g. God)\ncommands you to do something, then you have a moral obligation or\nmoral duty to do it. But in forms of ethics not based upon such a\nlegislator, talk about moral obligation or moral duty is akin to those\narguing about what is criminal in a society lacking criminal law or\ncourts, or, alternatively, to castaways talking about whether their\nclothing accords with the new company policy \u2013 the necessary\nsocial framework for making such talk meaningful is absent. Unlike J.\nL. Mackie, who thought that moral thought and talk was false, Anscombe\nargued that it was nonsense, which is probably worse. She held that\nethicists would do better to classify actions instead as, say,\ntruthful or untruthful, just or unjust, \u2026 rather than as\nmorally right or morally wrong.\n\nAnscombe\u2019s thought here resembled that of her contemporaries\nPhilippa Foot and Iris Murdoch. All were opposed to Utilitarianism,\nand were suspicious of its emphasis on \u2018thin\u2019 evaluative\nterms. Our moral thought is far richer than that. Of course, their\ncriticism was not restricted to Utilitarianism. Any moral theory\npredominantly employing thin moral concepts such as \u2018morally\nright\u2019 and \u2018morally wrong\u2019 were subject to this\ncritique. Thin moral concepts are opposed to \u2018thick\u2019 ones.\nBernard Williams famously characterized thick concepts this way:\n\nIf a concept of this kind applies, this often provides someone with a\nreason for action \u2026 We may say, summarily, that such concepts\nare \u201caction-guiding.\u201d \u2026 At the same time, their\napplication is guided by the world. A concept of this sort may be\nrightly or wrongly applied, and people who have acquired it can agree\nthat it applies or fails to apply to some new situation \u2026. We\ncan say, then, that the application of these concepts is at the same\ntime world-guided and action-guiding. (Williams, 1985, 140)\n\n\nTo describe an action as \u2018cowardly\u2019 seems to provide much\nmore information than to describe it as \u2018wrong\u2019. Further,\nthin terms can lead us astray. In MMP, after describing the\nUtilitarian commitment to be open, in principle, to \u201c\u2026\njudicially punishing a man for what he is clearly understood not to\nhave done \u2026\u201d, which is clearly \u2018unjust\u2019, she\nwrites:\n\nAnd here we see the superiority of the term \u2018unjust\u2019 over\nthe terms \u2018morally right\u2019 and \u2018morally wrong\u2019.\nFor in the context of English moral philosophy since Sidgwick it\nappears legitimate to discuss whether it might be \u2018morally\nright\u2019 in some circumstances to adopt that procedure; but it\ncannot be argued that the procedure would in any circumstances be\njust. (MMP, 16)\n\n\nNo doubt Anscombe\u2019s claims in MMP inspired some philosophers to\ndevelop modern versions of what\u2019s now known as virtue ethics, a\ntheory designed to be a full-fledged alternative to Kantianism,\nexistentialism, utilitarianism, and other totalizing theories. But it\nis crucially important to notice that Anscombe herself did not\nadvocate this development, and this brings us to the first thesis of\nMMP: it is not profitable for us at present to do moral philosophy\nuntil we have an adequate philosophy of psychology. Even if it would\nbe in some ways \u201cbetter\u201d to theorize about ethics by using\nvirtue concepts such as \u2018truthful\u2019 or \u2018just\u2019,\nrather than using concepts that now have no point, our efforts should\nreally be directed to the philosophy of psychology, and not to moral\nphilosophy at all. Even if we do know that some paths (e.g.\nthose which fixate on moral obligation) take us in the wrong\ndirection, we don\u2019t know which of the many remaining paths to\ntake.\n\nWhat did she have in mind by \u2018philosophy of psychology\u2019?\nIn MMP, she names several topics we would first need better\nconceptions of: \u2018action\u2019, \u2018intention\u2019,\n\u2018pleasure\u2019, \u2018wanting\u2019, and maybe one day\n\u2018virtue\u2019 and \u2018flourishing\u2019. She never\ndeveloped an adequate conception of virtue nor of flourishing, and so\nshe was never in a position even to begin doing moral\nphilosophy. But she did, of course, contribute to the development of\nbetter conceptions of action and intention.\n\nThere is some controversy about whether Anscombe was being sincere in\narguing we should stop doing moral philosophy. Crisp 2004 suspected\nthat she was surreptitiously arguing for the superiority of a\nGod-based moral philosophy over any secular moral philosophy,\neven one like Aristotle\u2019s. He worried that Anscombe\u2019s view\nthat moral philosophers should turn to issues in moral psychology\nreally applies only to those who deny divine law, and that Christians\nlike her can continue to do moral philosophy.\n\nIn a sense, Crisp is right. Anscombe did believe in a divine moral\nlaw, and so must have thought that a theistic moral philosophy would\nhave advantages over any other. And Anscombe, of course, did have\nviews about how to live, had arguments for some of these views, and\nrepeatedly opposed the zeitgeist by, say, protesting the use of atomic\nbombs and of abortion.\n\nBut when Anscombe said we (we secular or at least disunified\nphilosophers) should stop doing moral philosophy until we have an\nadequate philosophy of psychology, she did not mean that we should\nabandon all of our ethical thought and talk. This is for two reasons.\nFirst, one need not think it\u2019s profitable to do moral philosophy\nto have views about how to live or to coherently support or oppose\nvarious actions. Her plea to stop doing moral philosophy does\nnot conflict with her having strong views about what to oppose, just\nas one might have all kinds of views about what is and isn\u2019t\nillegal even if one never does any legal philosophy. Echoing\nRousseau, you don\u2019t need to be a philosopher in order to oppose\n(or support!) injustice.\n\nSecond, she did indeed think that some classes of action (e.g. murder)\nwere \u201cabsolutely excluded\u201d (MTD 71) for what we\nmight call moral reasons. But most of her argumentative writings on\nsuch topics were aimed at audiences who already shared her view that\none did not need the results of moral philosophy in order to live\nwell. In the preface to a posthumous collection of essays, Luke\nGormally explains that the bulk of her addresses in that volume were\ndelivered to Catholic audiences, where she assumed \u201cacceptance\nof authoritative Church teaching\u201d [FHG, x]. If you and your\naudience trust that God has promised each of you that it is in your\ninterest to avoid injustice, you don\u2019t need to deeply understand\nthe concept of flourishing or of virtue in order to talk to one\nanother about how to live. Compare: if you trust your travel agent\nwhen she says that drinking alcohol on what appears to you to be a\nstateless island is in fact illegal, then you don\u2019t need to do\npolitical philosophy in order to talk with your fellow travelers about\nwhether to leave the alcohol at home.\n\nFinally, as Aquinas exemplified, it\u2019s possible to think that\nmorality is based upon God and also believe that we need to understand\nthe nature of our psychology in order to adequately understand\nmorality. Her call to give moral philosophy a rest until we better\nunderstand the philosophy of psychology was addressed to us all, not\njust to a subset of moral philosophers.\n3. Metaphysics\n\nSome of Anscombe\u2019s most influential work was on the nature of\ncausation, a concept which is notoriously difficult to analyze. Part\nof her motivation for working on causation was to understand human\nfreedom. Her paper \u201cCausality and Determination\u201d [CAD]\nchallenged some of the empiricist orthodoxy of Hume\u2019s account.\nShe is concerned to distinguish causality from determination, arguing\nthat one event can cause another even if the latter isn\u2019t\ndetermined by its cause. When we note an event\u2019s cause, we note\nfrom what it derived. She writes \u201cCausality consists in the\nderivativeness of an effect from its causes\u201d (CAD, 136). But\nthat Y derives from X does not entail that\nX necessitated Y. So, we need not assume that every\ncause necessitates its effect. If causation always relates\ntypes of events (\u201cWhenever an X-like event\nhappens, a Y-like event happens\u201d), then it might look\nlike a cause necessitates its effect. But she challenged the view that\nthe causal relation is actually characterized by constant conjunction\nof types, and thus whether causation entails necessitation. Discussing\nFeynman\u2019s Geiger counter case, she writes:\n\nAn example of a non-necessitating cause is mentioned by Feynman: a\nbomb is connected to a Geiger counter, so that it will go off if the\nGeiger counter registers a certain reading; whether it will or not is\nnot determined, for it is so placed near some radioactive material\nthat it may or may not register that reading. (CAD, 145)\n\n\nAnd yet, if the bomb explodes it was caused by the Geiger counter\narrangement. Causation thus does not involve determination or\nnecessity. Since the radioactive decay was not sufficient for this\neffect, the case tells against viewing causes as sufficient\nconditions. There need be no general connection between cause and\neffect. This challenge to the Humean account would turn out to be very\ninfluential \u2013 it helped push philosophers towards the\ndevelopment of probabilistic accounts of causation to account for the\nabove type of case.\n\nInstead, Anscombe was a singularist about causation, since she further\nrejected the Humean view that causation is not observable in a single\ninstance. In her view, some perceivable events are themselves\ninstances of causation. Anscombe produced examples from ordinary\nlanguage that seem to show that we do perceive causation. Such\nexamples are abundant. \u201cI saw her clean the dishes\u201d\nreports the perception of a causal process.\n\nShe was also an indeterminist about freedom of action. Actions are\nmostly physical movements, and \u201cif these physical movements are\nphysically predetermined by processes which I do not control, then my\nfreedom is perfectly illusory\u201d (CAD, 146). Our actions are\nsurely caused, but not determined, and so there is still room for\nfreedom. Yet she also recognized that indeterminism does not suffice\nfor freedom; more is needed to establish that. We will need to\nunderstand what more is needed when we discuss her views about\naction.\n\nIn her paper \u201cThe First Person\u201d [TFP], originally\npublished in 1975, Anscombe argues for a thesis that seems patently\nfalse: the word \u201cI\u201d is not a referring expression. That\nis, while the function of a term like \u201cElizabeth\nAnscombe\u201d, or \u201cthe daughter of Allen Anscombe\u201d, or\n\u201cthat woman\u201d, or \u201cshe\u201d is\nreferential, the term \u201cI\u201d does not function in the same\nway. \u201cI\u201d thus refers to nothing at all. (Compare with the\nuse of \u2018It\u2019 in the thought \u201cIt is snowing.\u201d)\n\u201cThe First Person\u201d is probably Anscombe\u2019s most\ndifficult article \u2013 which is saying something \u2013 and even\nsympathetic scholars disagree about what the argument is supposed to\nbe. She was clearly influenced by Geach 1957, and by\nCaste\u00f1ada\u2019s various papers on the first person. Later,\nLewis 1979 discussed this issue in a distinct but by then familiar\nway.\n\nAnscombe focuses approvingly on some aspects of Descartes\u2019 use\nof \u2018I\u2019 in the Meditations. Famously, he cannot\ndoubt \u2018I exist.\u2019 But on the same grounds that he can doubt\n\u2018I have a body\u2019, he also can doubt \u2018I am\nDescartes.\u2019 After all, \u2018Descartes\u2019 is just the name\nof a human being, and he can doubt that he is any human being\nwhatsoever \u2013 he can wonder whether he\u2019s instead a brain in\na vat. So, if the argument indeed establishes the non-identity of\nhimself with this body, it likewise establishes the non-identity of\nhimself with Descartes!\n\nThis may seem strange, for this last thought may seem equivalent to\n\u201cDescartes was not Descartes\u201d, and that\ncan\u2019t be coherently denied. But Anscombe argues that these two\nthoughts are not equivalent. Why\u2019s that?\n\nWe do tend to think of \u2018I\u2019 as simply being that\nexpression people use to refer to themselves. However,\n\n\u201cWhen John Smith spoke of James Robinson he was speaking of his\nbrother, but he did not know this.\u201d That\u2019s a possible\nsituation. So similarly is \u201cWhen John Smith spoke of John\nHoratio Auberon Smith (named in a will perhaps) he was speaking of\nhimself, but he did not know this.\u201d If so, then \u2018speaking\nof\u2019 or \u2018referring to\u2019 oneself is compatible with not\nknowing that the object one speaks of is oneself. (TFP, 47)\n\n\nWe might then wish to say \u201cSmith can speak of himself without\nrealizing that he is speaking of himself.\u201d This shows\nthat there are two distinct kinds of reflexive pronouns: the ordinary\nreflexive pronoun and the indirect reflexive pronouns. The first\noccurrence of \u2018himself\u2019 immediately above is the ordinary\nreflexive pronoun, and it refers successfully just in case it picks\nout the same object as its antecedent. It doesn\u2019t matter\nhow it does so, nor must the antecedent and pronoun share a\nsense. When above we say \u201cSmith spoke of himself\u201d, we are\nusing the ordinary reflexive pronoun, for the person to whom Smith\nthereby referred was indeed the person who spoke.\n\nThings are different if we are tempted to say \u201cThe word\n\u2018I\u2019 is a word each of us uses in speaking of\nhimself.\u201d This use of \u2018himself\u2019 can\u2019t\nbe the ordinary reflexive, because, as we just saw, a person can speak\nof himself in cases where he wouldn\u2019t also use the word\n\u2018I\u2019 to refer to the same thing. The word\n\u2018himself\u2019 in this newer attempt at explaining the word\n\u2018I\u2019 gets its distinctive sense from that of the\nword \u2018I\u2019. But since the sense of the indirect reflexive\npronoun \u2018himself\u2019 depends upon that of the word\n\u2018I\u2019, we cannot use the indirect reflexive pronoun, as\nthough we understand it independently, to explain the word\n\u2018I\u2019. Things instead are the other way around. This\ndiscussion displays the problem that \u2018I\u2019 poses, but it\ndoesn\u2019t solve it.\n\nHow do we solve it? Anscombe thinks you can\u2019t. In the\nbulk of the paper, Anscombe argues that the word \u2018I\u2019\nisn\u2019t a referring expression in a few steps. First, she argues\nthat \u2018I\u2019 isn\u2019t like other referring expressions:\nproper names, other pronouns, demonstratives, definite descriptions,\nand so on. So we can\u2019t assimilate the use of the word\n\u201cI\u201d to other more tractable types of referring\nexpressions. Second, she argues that the only remaining possibility is\nthat the word \u201cI\u201d refers to an immaterial substance (a\nCartesian ego), or at least a stretch of such a substance that exists\nso long as one is thinking a thought. But that would still leave us no\nway to identify the same referent in different\n\u201cI\u201d-thoughts at different times, an\n\u201cintolerable\u201d result. Moreover, Anscombe explicitly denied\nthat there are immaterial substances. She described the very\nconception of an immaterial substance as \u201ca delusive one\u201d\n(IOS, 71).\n\nSo, having ruled out all the standard ways that terms refer, she\nconcludes that the function of the word \u2018I\u2019 is\nnon-referential. She says little about what its function is,\nalthough she notes that the word is dispensable \u2013 a language\nwhose verbs are conjugated to reflect what we call \u2018the first\nperson\u2019 (e.g. Latin, Spanish) can do without such a word. Her\nconclusion could be resisted if one produced a way of referring she\nhadn\u2019t considered, or if one rebutted any of her arguments\nagainst the possibilities she does consider. Important discussions of\nthis paper can be found in Doyle 2018, O\u2019Brien 1994, and many\nother places, and it has clearly inspired the work of R\u00f6dl\n2007.\n4. Action Theory\n\nAnscombe\u2019s Intention is one of the classics of 20th\ncentury philosophy. Indeed, it continues to be a standard point of\nreference for those working in action theory and philosophical\npsychology, so much so that contemporary theories of action are often\ncategorized as either Anscombean or Davidsonian.\n\nOn its back cover, David Velleman aptly quips that Intention\nis \u201coften quoted, sometimes read, rarely understood\u201d. Many\nreaders are indeed puzzled by the significance and the lessons of what\nshe writes. Intention is a work on the nature of agency\nthrough an understanding of the concept of intention. As we saw above,\nAnscombe wrote Intention after opposing supporters of\nTruman:\n\nPerplexed by defenders of Truman she came to the conclusion that they\nhad failed to understand the nature of his actions, and it was this\nthat led her to write Intention, in which she pointed out\nthat in doing one thing (moving one\u2019s hand) one may\nintentionally be doing another (directing the death of human beings).\n(Haldane 2000, 1020)\n\n\nIndeed we have seen many points in her work in moral philosophy where\nshe calls us to understand the concepts of action and of intention\nbetter.\n\nThe best way to understand the argument of the book might be to\nconsider its claims in a different order than the way the book lays\nthem out. For the actual narrative of the books deliberately leads the\nreader into a bunch of dead ends and incomplete solutions before\nforwarding specific positive claims.\n\nIn what might reasonably be considered to be the conclusion of the\nbook\u2019s argument, she writes that \u201cthe term\n\u2018intentional\u2019 has reference to a form of\ndescription of events\u201d (INT, 84). To unpack this cryptic\nthought, note first that the events she has in mind are some of those\nthat we human beings are the subject of. It does not pick out things\nthat merely happen to us.\n\nSecond, note that a single action can be described in various ways. Is\nhe moving his arm up and down? Pumping water? Doing his job? Clicking\nout a steady rhythm? Making a funny shadow on the rock behind him?\nWell, it could be that all of these descriptions are\ntrue.\n\nThird, note that even if the same action can be described in multiple\nways, it usually won\u2019t be intentional in every one of those ways\ndescribed. For example, even though a man is pumping water\nintentionally, he might not be making a funny shadow on the rock\nbehind him intentionally. But what determines which of the\ndescriptions of his action are indeed intentional?\n\nAt first, Anscombe answers this disjunctively: she identifies several\ncases which are not intentional, and several other cases that\nare. If you ask someone \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d, and\nthey give one of a few types of answers, this establishes that the\naction is not intentional. Such ways of answering can include 1)\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was doing that.\u201d, 2) \u201cI\n(merely) observed/inferred that I was doing that\u201d, 3) \u201cI\n(merely) observed/inferred how my physical movement was caused.\u201d\nBy contrast, the following answers show that the action so described\nis indeed intentional: 1) an answer that mentions something future\n(\u201cTo end the war\u201d), 2) an answer that interprets it\n(\u201cOut of curiosity\u201d) , 3) an answer that mentions\nsomething past that\u2019s given as the ground for something good or\nbad for the person at whom it is aimed (\u201cThey attacked us\nfirst\u201d), or, finally, 4) \u201cNo reason\u201d (INT, 24).\n\nSuch a hodgepodge of answers sheds little light upon the concept of\nintention, her quarry. Thus, she shifts methods. She emphasizes that\nin every case of doing something intentionally, you don\u2019t need\nto observe yourself in order to know that that\u2019s what you are up\nto. For example, you know that you are reading this encyclopedia\nentry, and you know this not because somebody told you, nor did you\nmerely infer it, nor did you see yourself in a mirror reading it.\nRather, you know it in some distinctive way, what later writers will\ncall a \u2018first-personal\u2019 way. Anscombe calls this knowledge\nof one\u2019s own intentional actions \u201cpractical\nknowledge\u201d, which is likewise obscure. But she concludes that\n\u201cthe notion of \u2018practical knowledge\u2019 can only be\nunderstood if we first understand \u2018practical\nreasoning\u2019\u201d (INT, 57). Thus it is only by grasping what it\nis to reason practically that we will understand what practical\nknowledge and the concept of intention are.\n\nWhat, then, is practical reasoning? There are two ways to think about\nit. One familiar way is via deliberation: we have some end, and we\nreason to some sufficient means to that end. Aristotle sketched things\nthis way. Anscombe focuses on another way (although it winds up being\nequivalent to the first). She notes that the various ways to describe\nwhat someone does can bear a particular order to one another.\nA man might be moving his arm up and down because (and not\njust, and) he is operating the pump, which he\u2019s doing because\n(and not just, and) he\u2019s pumping water to the house, and so on.\nThis is an order that really exists among events; it\u2019s not\nmerely the sum of merely physically described events going on in the\nworld and, also somehow, what\u2019s going on in his head.\nThis order is the order of intention.\n\nOf course, the man himself is in a special position to grasp this\nactually-existing order among the ways of describing what he\u2019s\ndoing. Anscombe compared this knowledge to the knowledge had by a man\nwho directs a project like the erection of a building simply by giving\norders for every little thing that anyone does, a project which he\ncan\u2019t see and gets no reports on. If all goes well, the director\nknows what\u2019s done, and his knowledge is practical knowledge. His\npractical knowledge is his grasping the order of the events that\nunfold. Practical knowledge, then, isn\u2019t fundamentally knowledge\nof certain atomic actions, e.g. thinking of a number, blinking.\nIt\u2019s knowledge of the entire means-end order among the things\none does, an order which of course includes the actions\nconstituting it. The man in the earlier example can say\n\u201cI\u2019m moving my arm up and down\u201d because he\ncan say \u201cI\u2019m moving my arm up and down because I\u2019m\npumping water\u201d.\n\nIndeed, many of the very concepts we use to describe movements\ninvolving human beings \u2013 e.g. \u2018greeting\u2019,\n\u2018hiring\u2019, \u2018sending for\u2019, even\n\u2018offending\u2019, \u2018dropping\u2019, \u2018placing\u2019\n\u2013 are concepts we\u2019d lack were we to lack the concept of\nintention. So the term \u2018intentional\u2019 refers not only to\nthe aforementioned \u2018because\u2019 and what it structures, but\nto the very terms by which we conceptualize most human and animal\nmovement. Intention is thus not something \u2018added\u2019 on to\nmere behavior we somehow first separately conceptualize. Rather, the\norder of intention is baked into the ways we represent our lives from\nthe very start.\n\nThere are a wealth of other sections from Intention that have\nbeen \u201coften quoted\u201d and yet \u201crarely\nunderstood\u201d. Consider, for example, this famous passage:\n\nLet us consider a man going round a town with a shopping list in his\nhand. Now it is clear that the relation of this list to the things he\nactually buys is one and the same whether his wife gave him the list\nor it is his own list; and that there is a different relation where a\nlist is made by a detective following him about. If he made the list\nitself, it was an expression of intention; if his wife gave it to him,\nit has the role of an order. What then is the identical relation to\nwhat happens, in the order and the intention, which is not shared by\nthe record? It is precisely this: if the list and the things that the\nman actually buys do not agree, and if this and this alone constitutes\na mistake, then the mistake is not in the list but in the man\u2019s\nperformance (if his wife were to say: \u201cLook, it says butter and\nyou have bought margarine\u201d, he would hardly reply: \u201cWhat a\nmistake! we must put that right\u201d and alter the word on the list\nto \u201cmargarine\u201d); whereas if the detective\u2019s record\nand what the man actually buys do not agree, then the mistake is in\nthe record. (INT, 56).\n\n\nAnscombe draws attention to the fact that when there is a discrepancy\nbetween a piece of paper and what happens, the source of the error\ndepends upon the \u201crole\u201d of the paper. If the paper has the\nrole of a record, the error is in the paper. But if the paper has the\nrole of an order or intention, the error is in what happens. Thus\nthere can be two ways to fail to know what happens: by\nmisrecording, and by misperforming. And one who practically knows\ndoesn\u2019t misperform.\n\nBeginning with Searle (1975), a different thesis gets very widely\nattributed to Anscombe in the literature: one about \u2018mental\nstates\u2019 like beliefs and desires, each of which supposedly has a\ndifferent \u201cdirection of fit\u201d. Anscombe, however, says\nnothing here about believing or desiring or other kinds of mental\nstates; the example instead displays two ways of knowing. Her\npoint is that you can know something either by believing something\nthat is (already) true, or by intentionally doing something. Both are\nforms of knowledge, and indeed there can be two ways to know one and\nthe same thing. (See Frost 2014.)\n\nAnscombe applied her views on intention to clarify her own positions\non controversial claims, such as the condemnation of contraception.\nOne puzzle in the Catholic doctrine condemning contraception, and yet\nallowing for the \u2018rhythm method\u2019 of avoiding pregnancy, is\nto reconcile the rationales in a consistent way. Many charged the\nChurch with inconsistency, since the intention to not get pregnant\nduring intercourse is present in both cases. Anscombe claims there is\nan important difference:\n\nThe reason why people are confused about intention, and why they\nsometimes think there is no difference between contraceptive\nintercourse and the use of infertile times to avoid conception, is\nthis: They don\u2019t notice the difference between\n\u201cintention\u201d when it means the intentionalness of the thing\nyou\u2019re doing \u2013 that you\u2019re doing this on\npurpose \u2013 and when it means a further or\naccompanying intention with which you do the thing.\n(CAC, 182)\n\n\nHer claim is that the further intentions that accompany these actions\nmay be the same, but there is a significant difference between the\nacts themselves. Her claim is that contraceptive intercourse, unlike\ntiming intercourse to coincide with infertile periods, is a bad sort\nof action because in the case of contraceptive intercourse\n\u201c\u2026to intend such an act is not to intend a marriage act\nat all, whether or not we\u2019re married\u201d (CAC, 183). Having\nintercourse that has purposely been rendered infertile is itself a\ndifferent act from having intercourse at an infertile time. Even\nthough both types of action may have the further aim of, for example,\nlimiting family size, the acts themselves differ. The\n\u201cperversion of the sex act in marriage is, in this one way, like\nwriting a forged check for a good cause\u201d, she claims. The\nfurther intention of, let\u2019s say, helping the needy is a worthy\none but does not vindicate the action of forging the check.\n\nNeedless to say, this view was controversial. Bernard Williams and\nMichael Tanner criticized her argument for failing to consider one of\nher own theses \u2013 that actions, including sorts of actions, can\nfall under a variety of descriptions. On their view, she is picking\nand choosing descriptions of actions in order to get the outcome she\nwants \u2013 a distinction between the rhythm method and\ncontraception that isn\u2019t just a trivial distinction. But, they\nargue, she cannot do this convincingly. They argue that couples who\nemploy the rhythm method are taking steps to achieve infertility just\nas those who take contraception are. Those steps are central to\nunderstanding the acts themselves, not simply the further purpose of\nthe acts. (Williams and Tanner 1972)\n5. Philosophy of Perception\n\nWhat is it that we perceive? The world? Or only our ideas or\nsense-data? Something else? Anscombe deployed some of the conceptual\nmachinery she had developed in the philosophy of action to topics in\nthe philosophy of sense-perception. Three relevant theses from the\nphilosophy of action include:\n\nNot any true description of what you do is an intentional action.\n(\u201cShe tripped over the rug\u201d)\nThe descriptions of what you intentionally do can be vague.\n(\u201cI\u2019m intentionally eating some jelly beans \u2013 but\nI\u2019m not intentionally eating some specific number of\nthem.\u201d)\nWhen you make a mistake, you might not do what you intend.\n(\u201cHe intended to unlock the door, but he mistakenly broke the\nknob.\u201d)\n\n\nAs we will see shortly, analogous claims can be made about sensation\nor perception.\n\nBut first, note that Anscombe distinguished sharply between two senses\nof the word \u201cobject\u201d \u2013 one of which is material\n(\u201cThere are ten objects on the bowling lane\u201d), while the\nother is intentional (\u201cImmortality was the object of his\ndesire\u201d), which otherwise needn\u2019t exist at all. An\nintentional object is given by a word or phrase which gives a\ndescription under which it is such (IOS, 9). She insists that\nneither sense of the word \u201cobject\u201d is deviant nor\nphilosophically uninteresting, but they are easily confused with each\nother.\n\nShe makes a foray into grammatical theory to illustrate the\npossibility of this distinction between senses of\n\u201cobject\u201d. Consider the sentence \u201cLuke gave Leia his\nlightsaber\u201d. If asked \u201cWhat object did Luke give\nLeia?\u201d, we would reply \u201chis lightsaber\u201d. And if\nasked for the direct object of the sentence, we would again reply\n\u201chis lightsaber\u201d. But although \u201chis\nlightsaber\u201d is indeed the direct object of the sentence, Luke\ndid not give Leia a direct object; to think otherwise is to confuse\nthe two senses. Moreover, \u201chis lightsaber\u201d is the direct\nobject of this sentence, even though no lightsaber materially exists.\nIt would be foolish to object to the claim that the direct object of\nthe sentence is \u201chis lightsaber\u201d on the grounds that\nlightsabers aren\u2019t real. Anscombe\u2019s insight is that\nlikewise there are also objects of perception in both a material and\nan intentional sense.\n\nIn light of the three claims above, Anscombe makes three analogous\nclaims about sense-perception:\n\nNot any true description of what you perceive is the intentional\nobject of what you perceive. For example, what you see might be a\npicture of a duck-rabbit drawn by the Queen, but you might not see it\nas a picture of a duck-rabbit, nor as a picture drawn by the Queen\n\u2013 you happen to see only a picture of a duck, the intentional\nobject of sight.\nYou might perceive something vaguely. For example, although the\ntree you see has 125 leaves (material object), you see only a tree\nwith an indeterminate number of leaves (intentional object).\nYou can perceive something that doesn\u2019t materially exist.\nFor example, after rubbing your eyes you might see stars (intentional\nobject), even though materially there are no stars to be seen.\n\n\nAnscombe maintained that certain philosophical views look inescapable\nonly if we conflate these two distinct senses. Idealism is the view\nthat we see only sense data, taking what is the intentional object of\nperception also to be the material objection of perception. On the\nother hand, direct realism (or what she calls \u2018ordinary language\nphilosophy\u2019) holds that we see only material objects without any\nintermediaries, overlooking or dismissing the legitimate use of saying\nthings like \u201cNow I see stars\u201d after getting hit on the\nhead. They thereby ignore or misunderstand the relevance of the\nintentional sense of sense-perception. Thus neither idealism nor\ndirect realism recognizes the importance of the distinction between\ntwo ways of thinking about verbs of sense-perception. Both views thus\nfail to recognize the distinct intentionality of sensation.\n\nAlthough these two senses are distinct, Anscombe notes that sometimes\npeople use the word \u201csee\u201d and other verbs of\nsense-perception without definitely intending it either only\nmaterially or only intentionally. Only further questioning would nudge\nthem to make their meaning more specific.\n6. Testimony\n\nAmong the very many topics Anscombe worked on, her ideas about the\nrole of testimony have prefigured or influenced much contemporary\nthought on the topic. We will summarize three of her short but\nimportant papers on testimony: \u201cHume and Julius Caesar\u201d\n(HJC), \u201cWhat Is It to Believe Someone?\u201d (WBS), and\n\u201cAuthority in Morals\u201d (AIM), each of which heralds ideas\nthat gained prominence in philosophy only later.\n\nIn HJC, she considers Hume\u2019s answer to the question, how do we\nknow about historical events? For example, how do we know that Caesar\nwas killed on the Ides of March? How do we even know that Caesar was a\nreal man, and not a mythical figure like Electra? Hume\u2019s answer\nwas essentially that you perceive or remember someone (perhaps your\nschool teacher) telling you about Caesar, and you next infer the cause\nof that \u2013 namely, that someone told them \u2013 and so on,\nuntil you infer that there were eyewitnesses in the Senate, who then\nwitnessed Caesar\u2019s death. You thus infer the original event\nthrough a series of causes terminating in something you perceive or\nremember perceiving.\n\nAnscombe argued that Hume\u2019s answer cannot be right. First, is it\nreally true that we infer that Caesar was killed on the Ides of March\nfrom the thought there were many observant people in the\nSenate that day? No. If anything, it\u2019s the other way around:\ngiven that we think that Caesar was killed then and there, we\ninfer that there must have been eyewitnesses to his death. It is not\nthat we first establish the presence of these people, and only then\ninfer what caused them to say what they said.\n\nAnscombe also discussed \u201cone of the rare pieces of stupidity in\nthe writings of Wittgenstein\u201d (HJC, 89). He once wrote that if\nwe were to find a piece of writing saying Caesar never existed, and\nwas invented for other ends, this would be some evidence that Caesar\nnever existed. Anscombe pushes us to think further about this. If we\nwere to discover such a document, we would instead immediately\nconclude it to be worthless, this because it conflicts with so much we\nhave been taught about the history of the West. She thus opposed the\nidea that our belief in Caesar\u2019s existence rests upon any\nevidence we have for it, rather than from our directly\ntrusting what we have been taught. A coherentist might reply that any\ndocument alleging Caesar\u2019s nonexistence clashes with the\npreponderance of historical evidence we have about him, and that we\ncan check the claims of this document against these other sources of\nevidence. But Anscombe rejoins that these other sources of\n\u201cevidence\u201d are themselves historians who straightforwardly\nbelieve much of what they have been taught, and we believe them. Thus,\nwe cannot \u201creduce\u201d testimony to some other source of\njustification. Believing testimony is basic.\n\nShe provocatively concludes the essay\n\n[N]ot everything can be put up for checking. Von Neurath\u2019s image\nof the ship which we repair \u2013 and, I suppose, build on to\n\u2013 while it is afloat: if this suggests that we can go round\ntapping every plank for rottenness, and so we might end up with a\nwholly different ship, the analogy is not good. For there are things\nthat are on a level. A general epistemological reason for doubting one\nwill be a reason for doubting all, and then none of them would have\nanything to test it(HJC, 92)\n\n\nShe thus opposes epistemological coherentism about justification, or\nat least a certain popular version of it. The many sources of\ninformation about Caesar\u2019s life are themselves equally\nvulnerable to skepticism, and so we cannot actually test the former\nwhile trusting the latter. Without trusting what we have been taught,\nwe have almost no historical knowledge.\n\nWell before C. A. J. Coady\u2019s masterful monograph on testimony\n(1992) that revived widespread interest in the topic, Anscombe\npublished a little essay titled \u201cWhat Is It to Believe\nSomeone?\u201d, anticipating many points he and others later\ndeveloped. She wrote that the topic of believing someone is not merely\nneglected but actually unknown in the philosophical discussion of her\ntime. Yet she avers that it is \u201cof great importance in\nphilosophy and in life\u201d, for \u201cthe greater part of our\nknowledge of reality rests upon the belief that we repose in things we\nhave been taught and told\u201d. What is it, then, for a\nperson, rather than a proposition, to be the object of\nbelief?\n\nAnscombe distinguishes believing a person from believing what a person\nsays, for you can do the latter without the former \u2013 both when\nyou already believe what is said, and when you believe that the person\nis both misinformed and yet trying to deceive you. Anscombe describes\nmany \u201cpresuppositions\u201d to believing someone: noticing the\nrelevant sound or inscription, understanding it as an attempt to\ncommunicate, noticing that it is addressed to oneself, understanding\nit properly, understanding that it was produced by the person indeed\nproducing it, and many more. Only once all these are in place do we\ncome to the situation where we can ask: \u201cDoes he believe\nher?\u201d\n\nIt is no small matter whether people trust you when you tell them\nthings. Anscombe claimed \u201cIt is an insult and it may be an\ninjury not to be believed\u201d (WBS, 9). Although she does not\nelaborate upon the nature of the insult and injury, her claim\nforeshadows contemporary discussions of epistemic injustice.\nInterestingly, it can be insulting, she notes, not even to be\nheard as telling one something. For example, if you tell me\np, but I fail to note that you were telling me anything\n\u2013 perhaps I thought you were just venting aloud \u2013 you\nmight reasonably say that I disrespectfully failed to believe you. We\ncan wrong one another by refusing to accept one another\u2019s word,\nan idea that has recently become widely discussed at the intersection\nof epistemology and ethics.\n\nIn the third paper on testimony, \u201cAuthority in Morals\u201d,\nAnscombe again considers a few related questions that only recently\nhave become widely discussed: can one person aptly tell another what\nto think about morality, and can the hearer aptly trust what they are\nthus told? Given that the paper was originally presented at a\nconference in an abbey, much of her discussion involves trusting a\nreligious authority about moral truths. But her points generalize.\n\nAnscombe compares moral teaching to mathematical teaching: in both\ncases, one must do something to truly learn what is being\ntaught, rather than merely accepting something as to be believed.\nTeaching someone either morality or mathematics thus won\u2019t just\ninvolve the formation of belief. Even so, she denies that a proper\nunderstanding of autonomy is incompatible with trusting moral\ntestimony: deciding to trust someone who tells you about a bit of\nmoral truth can be a way of thinking for oneself. A man who\ndoes this and acts on this testimony is still \u201chis own\npilot\u201d (AIM, 49).\n\nYet there are limits to moral testimony. Although she thinks certain\ndogmatic truths are religiously revealed and could not otherwise be\nknown, this is not so for moral truths. Moral truths may be\nreligiously revealed only per accidens. In other words, moral\ntruths can always be known other than by trusting some\nsource. There seems to be no room for moral truths that per\nse can be taken only through trust.\n\nOne way moral truths can be revealed per accidens is when\nsomeone relies on an authority for a moral claim that they in some\nsense could have thought out for themselves, but didn\u2019t.\nAnscombe does not imply that so relying need be a sign of laziness;\nrather, she thinks that different people have already grasped\ndifferent parts of the moral law (AIM, 45), and so seems to think that\nsharing moral truths is much like sharing other truths. For example,\nif you tell me what you ate for lunch, I can reasonably trust you even\nif in principle it\u2019s true that I could have instead spied on you\nto find out. Likewise, I might reasonably believe you when you tell me\nsome moral truth that I hadn\u2019t worked out for myself (but, in\ntheory, could).\n\nThe second way moral truths can be revealed per accidens is\nwhen their factual grounds are knowable only by religious revelation.\nFor example, consider the ascetic life. As Hume noted, there seems to\nbe nothing good about it. And so if someone were to tell you that it\nis indeed good, there would be no question of believing them.\n\nBut now suppose you come to accept certain ordinary (non-moral) truths\nof revealed religion: the doctrine of original sin, and the\npossibility of joining your suffering with that of Christ. Now in\nlight of accepting these ideas, it becomes possible to see for\nyourself that there is indeed something good about the ascetic life.\nSo, you need not accept this moral claim itself on the basis of\nreligious revelation, but you accept it on the basis of other truths\nthemselves accepted as revelation. Moral truths, however,\nalways can in principle be graspable without needing to trust another.\nEven though there need be nothing bad about trusting an authority who\nteaches about morality, their teachings, if true, could be\narrived at otherwise.\n7. Conclusion\n\nG. E. M. Anscombe\u2019s work ranged over many years and many\ndifferent areas in philosophy. The breadth of her work is impressive.\nShe was systematic in her thinking, seeing and developing connections\nbetween metaphysics, moral psychology, and ethics that exhibited not\nsimply a grasp of one particular problem, but a world view. Much of\nher works remains unpublished, although newly accessible through the\nAnscombe Papers Project at the Collegium Institute for Catholic\nThought & Culture. Anscombe\u2019s legacy is one of the broadest\nand deepest left by a 20th century philosopher.\n",
