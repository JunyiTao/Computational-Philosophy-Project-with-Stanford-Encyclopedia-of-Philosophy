    "main_text": "Kinds of Associations || Related Phenomena: Interactions and Assemblies\n1.3 Related Phenomena: Interactions and Assemblies\n\nOur persistent associations differ from, but intersect with, our\npractice of engaging in ordinary interactions with each other and our\npractice of assembling together.\nInteracting: Interactions of some sort are a\npre-requisite for associations. Two \u201cfriends\u201d are hardly\nfriends if they opt never to interact with each other when they could.\nWithin large collectives, of course, many members won\u2019t know or\ninteract with each other at all. But, each member must interact with\nsome other member for them to count as a member and for their\ncollective to count as an association. Interactions are also a domain\nof interpersonal engagement unto themselves apart from associations.\nOur average day is full of incidental interactions with strangers and\nnon-associates, on buses, in the streets, in parks with children, and\nin buying milk from the local shop. These micro-moments of connection\nconstitute a significant portion of our experience of living together\nwith other people (Fredrickson 2013: Part I; Speck 2012: 49; Cacioppo\n& Patrick 2008: 237). While philosophers tend to focus on\nlarger-scale, substantive and active forms of association, they have\nreason to analyze as well the ambient sociability (or lack of it) that\nis available to us within our general environment, and the ways that\nour incidental interactions (or lack of them) can resonate with the\nrest of our associational life. For example, the phenomena of\n\u201cneighborhood effects\u201d on voting behavior, our attitudes\nto strangers, and our own self-esteem, are important in thinking about\nthe associative value in our routine connections that fall short of\nthicker forms of association (Sampson 2011). These interactions and\nthe incidental communities they create provide resources that can\nbuild up to, and support, the more substantive goods that flow from\nmeaningful association (Fleischacker 1998: 273; Fredrickson 2013: Part\nII). Importantly, the quality and number of these incidental\nmicro-interactions is subject partly to our control. We limit our\nopportunities for such moments if, for example, we choose to shop\nonline, to commute alone in our car, or to retreat into a gated\ncommunity with vigorous vetting processes for residents.\nAssembling: Association and assembly are often discussed\nin the same breath. International agreements such as the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (Article 20.1) lump the two\ntogether to declare that \u201ceveryone has the right to freedom of\npeaceful assembly and association\u201d. Commentaries on the drafting\nof the UDHR acknowledge that drafters conjoined these two activities\nin a single Article because drafters were thinking principally about\nhow to protect political associations such as trade unions (Scheinin\n1999: 418\u2013419). Subsequent international agreements such as the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights enumerate our\nrights to association and rights to assembly within different\nArticles. One reason for this could be to acknowledge that assembling\nis but one activity in which certain associates might partake and,\nequally, it can be done by people who are not associates. Assembling\ncan be both a product of, and a Petri dish for, intimate and\nnon-intimate associations. A second reason to divorce assembling from\nassociating is to recognize properly that associative freedom includes\nintimate associations as well as collective and expressive\nassociations (Scheinin 1999: 420). Assembling has political\nconnotations. We prefer to speak of family members or congregations\n\u201cgathering\u201d, for example, or to describe an audience as\nbeing together \u201cin attendance\u201d (though we do speak of\nschool \u201cassemblies\u201d). \u201cAssembly\u201d we tend to\nreserve for activists, protesters, town hall members, or lobbyists. In\npolitics, people assemble in a physical space (we do not (yet) speak\nof people \u201cassembling\u201d on social media) usually to empower\nthemselves individually and collectively, and to make non-participants\naware of their energy, numbers, and intentions (Graeber 2013:\n35\u201354).\n",
