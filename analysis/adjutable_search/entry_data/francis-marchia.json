    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Work\n\n Francis of Marchia (a.k.a. de Appignano, de Pignano, de Esculo, de\nAscoli, Franciscus Rubeus, and the Doctor Succinctus) was\nborn ca. 1285\u20131290 in the village of Appignano del Tronto in the\nprovince of Ascoli Piceno, east of Rome and near the Adriatic (see especially Marchia 2008, xiii\u2013xvii). He became a Franciscan and rose in the order\u2019s educational hierarchy, probably studying theology at the\nUniversity of Paris around 1310, then teaching at a Franciscan\nstudium elsewhere, before returning to the Minorites\u2019 Paris\nstudium to lecture on the Sentences of Peter Lombard\nas bachelor of theology, a common career path for members of the\nmendicant orders at the time. Marchia\u2019s Parisian lectures on the\nSentences were delivered during the 1319\u201320 academic\nyear. What little information we have suggests that Marchia remained in Paris at least until 1323, by which time he had most likely been promoted to master\nof theology. He did not attend the Franciscan General Chapter in Perugia in 1322, although in 1321 he may have visited the court of King Robert of Anjou, then residing in Avignon. A document of April 1328 places Marchia as lector at\nthe Franciscan convent in Avignon (Nicolaus Minorita 1996, 189), the\nsite of the papal court, but we have no solid evidence for his earlier\npresence there. (Marchia\u2019s stay in Avignon is commonly thought to have begun by\n1324, but this is based on an error: a reference to Marchia\u2019s confr\u00e8re Francis of Meyronnes in the Quodlibet of the Augustinian James of Pamiers was misinterpreted as citing Marchia. Without contemporary documentation, later\nwriters claimed that Marchia was elected Franciscan provincial minister\nof his native area, Marchia, in 1327, but Roberto Lambertini has found evidence definitively refuting this assertion.)\n\nThe 1328 document concerns Marchia\u2019s falling out with\nPope John XXII for supporting the Franciscan Minister General Michael\nof Cesena on the issue of apostolic poverty. The next month Marchia\nfled Avignon with William of Ockham and others, first going to Pisa,\nwhere, under the protection of the Holy Roman Emperor Louis of\nBavaria, Marchia and Ockham respectively were the top witnesses to a\ndocument composed against Pope John in September 1328 (Nicolaus\nMinorita 1996, 423, 455). Soon afterwards Marchia apparently went on a\nmission to France, for in February of 1329 Pope John wrote to Elias of\nNabinaux, then Franciscan bachelor of the Sentences at Paris,\nordering him to arrest Marchia and ship him to Avignon under guard\n(CUP II, no. 886). The pope had heard recently that Marchia had gone\n\u201cto Paris and other parts of France to spread the worst errors and to\nturn the hearts of the faithful religious and others, especially our\nmost dear children in Christ the illustrious king and queen, as well\nas other princes and magnates, from their devotion to the Church.\u201d The\nFranciscans at Paris loyal to the pope moved against the rebels in\nJune. Marchia and his colleagues continued to write against the pope;\nthe pope responded in the bull Quia vir reprobus of 16\nNovember 1329. Meanwhile Marchia had taken refuge in Munich at the\ncourt of the Emperor, along with Cesena, Ockham, Marsilius of Padua,\nand others. It was in Munich, probably around the start of the new\nyear, 1330, that Marchia began to write his Improbatio\nagainst John XXII\u2019s bull (Lambertini 2006a, 187\u20139). Marchia remained a\nfugitive and important papal adversary for several years, well into\nthe reign of Pope Benedict XII, but he was eventually\ncaptured. Although there are problems with the date, a document\nindicates that Marchia\u2019s trial began in early 1341. He confessed and\nretracted his errors before the Inquisition at the end of 1343\n(Wittneben-Lambertini 1999, 2000). Thus reconciled with the Church,\nFrancis of Marchia disappears from the historical record.\n\nFrom Marchia\u2019s Parisian lectures of 1319\u201320 we have a popular commentary on all four books of the Sentences, extant in at least ten manuscripts\nfor each book, with two distinct redactions of book I and two differing versions of books III and IV, alongside various abbreviations (on Marchia\u2019s works, see Friedman-Schabel 2001 and Marchia 2008, xix\u2013xxiii). Manuscript Vat. lat. 943 preserves a full redaction of book II and fragments of the other three books of a commentary on the Sentences that Marchia may have composed outside\nParis after studying there, so this could represent Marchia\u2019s early teaching, although it may also be connected with his Paris lectures themselves. Marchia\u2019s sole Quodlibet was probably held in Marchia\u2019s Paris period as well, rather than in Avignon as previously thought, although the first two questions in the modern edition do not belong to Marchia\u2019s text but to John Duns Scotus\u2019 Sentences commentary (Duba 2007, 2008). It is difficult to date Marchia\u2019s literal commentary on\nthe Physics, his short commentary on the first two books of the Metaphysics, and his related question commentary on the first seven books of the\nMetaphysics. The question commentary had been dated to before 1323, but this was based on the erroneous terminus ante quem of 1323 for the question commentary on the Physics of \u2018John the Canon\u2019, actually Francis Marbres, which cites explicitly and copies from Marchia\u2019s Metaphysics questions. Marbres actually composed his work after 1325 and probably around 1330 (Duba 2014a, 445\u20136; Schabel 2014).\n\n\nUntil 1991, when Notker Schneider\u2019s monograph on Francis of Marchia\u2019s cosmological ideas appeared (Schneider 1991), almost none of Marchia\u2019s writings had been published and only\nAnneliese Maier had devoted serious and sustained attention to his thought\n(Maier 1940\u20131958). Since then, however, Nazzareno Mariani has\npublished eight volumes of Marchia\u2019s works: the Improbatio\n(Marchia 1993; also in Italian: Marchia 2001a), the Physics commentary (Marchia 1998), the\nQuodlibet (Marchia 1997, including a transcription of roughly a quarter of\nthe Scriptum version of book I of the Sentences\ncommentary and two questions from book II in appendices), the four\nPrincipia and the Prologue to his Sentences\nlectures, the Reportatio\nversion of book I of the Sentences commentary (Marchia\n2003, 2006a, 2007, 2009), and finally the Metaphysics commentary (Marchia 2012; in Italian: Marchia 2013a). While Mariani has edited the Reportatio of book I, Russell Friedman and Christopher\nSchabel have laid the foundations for the Scriptum edition\n(Friedman 1997, 1999; Marchia 1999, 2000, 2001b), and Girard J. Etzkorn has completed a working edition of the entire book. For book II, Etzkorn\u2019s edition of the Vat. lat. 943\nversion is forthcoming, and the critical edition of the main redaction has already been published in three volumes by Tiziana\nSuarez-Nani, William Duba, Etzkorn,\nEmmanuel Babey, and Delphine Carron (Marchia 2008, 2010, 2013b). Duba is completing an edition of the versions of book III (Duba 2003\u201304; Duba-Schabel 2006\u201308), and Roberto\nLambertini and Schabel have been untangling book IV (Lambertini 2004,\n2006b; Marchia 2006b, 2006c; Katsoura-Papamarkou-Schabel 2006).\n\n With the edition of many of Marchia\u2019s works thus completed and the\nremainder in progress, Marchia studies have matured since the first\nversion of this entry was published in early 2001. Six papers on Marchia were presented at the SIEPM congress on medieval philosophy in Porto in 2002, a special issue\nof Vivarium was devoted to Marchia in 2006 and published as\na book (Friedman-Schabel 2006), a monograph on Marchia appeared in 2008 (Folger-Fonfara 2008), and a volume of Tiziana Suarez-Nani\u2019s revised articles on Marchia will appear shortly (Suarez-Nani 2015). The journal Picenum\nSeraphicum, edited by Roberto Lambertini, continues to be a\nforum for Marchia studies. Most impressively, with the initiative\nof the Comune di Appignano del Tronto under the leadership of Domenico\nPriori, the Centro Studi Francesco d\u2019Appignano was established in\nMarchia\u2019s hometown in May of 2001 during the First International\nConference on Francis of Marchia. With the publication of the proceedings of the sixth such\nconference in 2014 (Priori 2014), some fifty studies on Marchia by leading scholars have appeared from these venues alone, and the seventh meeting is\nplanned for 2016. Thus around one hundred new studies have\nappeared dealing with different aspects of Marchia\u2019s thought. Many questions about his works have been settled, but\nnew disagreements have arisen, for example about the relative\nchronology of the Vat. lat. 943 version of Marchia\u2019s\nSentences commentary, the character of the main versions of\nbook IV, the respective dating and nature of the\nScriptum and Reportatio on book I, and the authenticity of sermons attributed to him (Friedman-Schabel\n2001; Mariani 2002; Friedman 2004; Schabel 2004; Lambertini 2004;\nLambertini 2006b; Alliney 2006a; Katsoura-Papamarkou-Schabel\n2006\u201308; Lambertini 2009a; Duba 2014b). There is also significant\ndebate about Marchia\u2019s thought, as will be seen below in\nthe section on natural philosophy.\n\nMuch work from the past few years has concentrated on Marchia\u2019s ideas in metaphysics, both in his commentaries on the Aristotelian work and in the various versions of his Sentences commentary. In particular, Marchia has been singled out for the theory of \u2018supertranscendentals\u2019 and for his explicit distinction between special and general metaphysics, foreshadowing an early modern development. There is some indication that Marchia\u2019s innovations in metaphysics were influential into the fifteenth century, but more research is called for (see especially Folger-Fonfara 2008; Amerini 2008b; Aertsen 2012; Duba 2014a). In anticipation of the reaction of\nthe scholarly community to these and other new studies and of the further\ncontextualization of Marchia\u2019s ideas, the present edition of this\nentry will concentrate on what is already known to be both distinctive and\ninfluential in Marchia\u2019s thought.\n2. Philosophical Theology\n\n\nMarchia\u2019s main and most popular writing, larger than all his other\nworks combined, is the Sentences commentary. Although this\ngenre of scholastic writing contains much material that we would call\npure science, especially in Marchia\u2019s case (see\n Natural Philosophy\n below), it is primarily a vehicle for philosophical\ntheology. Here it must be stressed at the outset that Francis of\nMarchia was not a faithful Scotist, contrary to a\ncommon opinion based on misconceptions from early in the twentieth\ncentury. Most recent research has proven that Marchia generally\nrejected or severely modified John Duns Scotus\u2019s doctrines, rather than\nfollowed them, even in the specific contexts like Trinitarian theology\nwhere he was claimed to have been a loyal Scotist (Friedman 1999). For\nexample, Marchia was uncomfortable with Scotus\u2019s stress on and use of a\nstrong distinction between the divine intellect and will, and this led\nMarchia to oppose Scotus on issues such as the procession of the Holy\nSpirit and the mechanism of divine foreknowledge. Indeed, it seems that\nMarchia was perhaps less of a Scotist than any of the other continental\nFranciscans active between Peter Auriol and the Black Death.\nNevertheless, Scotus forms much of the backdrop for Marchia\u2019s theology.\nThe other thinker against whose theories Marchia often developed his\nown doctrine was Auriol, whose Sentences commentary Marchia\nappears to have known in a Reportatio version. \n\n\nThe completed critical edition of just one redaction of Marchia\u2019s Sentences\ncommentary will take up about a dozen volumes. It is\nroughly equal in size to that of his contemporary and confr\u00e8re\nLandulph Caracciolo. Whereas Caracciolo\u2019s commentary is frequently a\ndisjointed, point-by-point refutation of Peter Auriol and defense of\nScotus on many issues, however, Marchia was more selective in choosing\nhis topics, more independent in giving his determination, and generally\nmore eloquent. For example, Marchia asks only one brief question on the\nImmaculate Conception, a favorite Franciscan topic (book III, q. 8; Duba 2004), showing himself to\nsupport the immaculatist position, but he asks a great number of\nquestions in books I, II, and IV on the relationship between the will\nand intellect.\n\n\nThus, although Auriol\u2019s controversial opinions on epistemology and\ndivine foreknowledge drew fire from Caracciolo and most other Paris\ntheologians up to Gregory of Rimini\u2019s day, even from Oxford\nFranciscans, Marchia devoted much energy to foreknowledge but almost\nignored the great debate over intuitive and abstractive cognition.\nAside from an isolated mention of \u201cintuitive cognition\u201d in\nScriptum I, d. 3, q. 4, and of \u201cintuitive vision\u201d in the very\nlast question in book IV, Marchia merely discusses the problem in\npassing on two brief occasions: first, in book II, q. 25 (Marchia\n1997, p. 322), while treating angelic knowledge, and second, in book\nIII, q. 13, in the context of the beatific vision of the Word (Duba\n2003\u201304). In the latter case, the more substantial passage, he gives a\nsomewhat Scotistic definition: \u201cIntuitive and abstractive cognition\nare not distinguished according to having a species or not, but only\naccording to the disposition of the object, because if the object is\npresent, the species represents it intuitively; if absent, it\nrepresents it abstractively.\u201d Therefore, \u201cthe same species that is\nintuitive in the presence of the object is abstractive in the absence\nof the object.\u201d Marchia adds in agreement with Auriol that God \u201ccan\ncause the act of seeing without the object,\u201d and that a species of a\ncreated object \u201cindifferently represents\u201d a present or absent object.\nAlthough this might provoke some epistemological questions, Marchia\nturns to the vision of the Essence and leaves human cognition in\nvia aside.\n\n\nIn contrast, Marchia singled out divine foreknowledge for special\ntreatment, devoting three entire distinctions (Scriptum I, dd.\n35, 36, and 38) to the issue and concentrating most of his discussion\non the reconciliation of foreknowledge with human free will (Marchia\n1999, 2000; Schabel 2000). Here Marchia was opposed in some way to\njust about everyone else who had written on the issue, but mainly\nAuriol, who had claimed that any determination prior to the coming\nabout of a contingent event destroyed contingency, including the truth\nor falsity of future-contingent propositions. Marchia\u2019s defense of the\napplication of the Principle of Bivalence to propositions about the\ncontingent future was the model for Gregory of Rimini. But having shown\nthat such propositions are either determinately true or false, Marchia\nwent on to articulate a type of prior determination that saved\nforeknowledge while preserving contingency. In fact, according to\nMarchia, there must be some determination in the causes of\nfuture contingent events prior to their actual occurrence; otherwise\nnothing would occur:\nAnd I ask about that determination in the cause, was it in\nthe cause before the placing of the effect [into reality] or not? If it\nwas, then I have my point. If not, I ask, how is the effect determined\nin its cause before it is put into being, necessarily or contingently?\nIf necessarily, then it comes about necessarily, according to this\nopinion. If contingently and a contingent is not determined to one side\nin its cause, then that determination is not determined except through\nsome prior contingent determination. And I would ask of this just as\nbefore, will it go on infinitely, or is it necessary to stop at some\ncontingent determination in the cause before the effect? (d. 35:\nMarchia 1999, p. 75)\n\n Marchia, however, was aware that Auriol had claimed that any such prior\ndetermination was fatal for contingency, so Marchia draws a distinction\nbetween different indeterminations and determinations, perhaps\nexpanding on isolated remarks made by Scotus. There is (1) an\nindetermination \u2018about the possible\u2019 (de\npossibili), with respect to being able to act and being able not\nto act. With this indetermination, we are not determined\nde possibili before an event, so we are free and act\ncontingently and not necessarily. There is also (2) a posterior\nindetermination \u2018about inhering\u2019 (de inesse), with\nrespect to what will be the case in reality. This indetermination\ntoward what will inhere in reality, however, would be an\nobstacle to foreknowledge and, for us, to acting. Thus it must\nbe replaced by (3) a determination in the contingent cause toward\nacting, both for the future to be known and for us to act. The (4)\ndetermination de possibili, toward being able to act or being\nable not to act, is absent from free causes until the event occurs, at\nwhich time our freedom and power with respect to that event are\nremoved. \n\n\nAn obvious objection is that, for Marchia, the effect is determinate\nin the cause before the action of the cause, and thus that\ndetermination is \u2018presupposed\u2019 in the subsequent action of\nthe cause. Since it is \u2018presupposed\u2019, that determination is\nnot in the cause\u2019s power, and thus is not contingent. Marchia replies\nwith another distinction:\n\u2018Action\u2019 can be taken in three ways: either it\ncan be taken actually, namely when an agent is actually acting; or it\ncan be taken virtually, when an agent can act although he is not\nacting; or it can be taken in a middle way, not purely actually nor\npurely virtually, but in a middle way as \u2018dispositionally\u2019\nor \u2018aptitudinally\u2019, namely when an agent is not acting but\nis determined toward acting, although in actuality he is not acting\n\u2014 and he not only can act, but is determined to be acting later.\nSimilarly there is a threefold \u2018determination\u2019 of the\nagent: one actual, by which an agent actually determinately puts one\npart of a contradiction into effect; a second is a potential\ndetermination by which an agent posits or can determine any part of a\ncontradiction dividedly; the other is, as it were, a\n\u2018dispositional\u2019 or \u2018aptitudinal\u2019 determination,\nby which an agent is determined with respect to the future to putting\none part of a contradiction [into effect]. Each determination\npresupposes the action corresponding to it, because an actual\ndetermination follows the action in actuality; the dispositional\ndetermination follows the action dispositionally, although it precedes\nthe actual action; the potential determination follows the potential\naction, although it precedes that actual and dispositional action. (d.\n35: Marchia 1999, pp. 89\u201390)\n\n Thus when an agent is determined de inesse to doing\nsomething in the future, that determination is like a disposition, and\nneither actual, because the event has not yet occurred, nor potential,\nbecause the possibility to do otherwise is not removed. Such a\ndetermination is not \u2018actually\u2019 in the agent\u2019s power,\nMarchia grants, but it is in his power \u2018dispositionally\u2019,\nfor although the agent cannot act before he acts, he can be disposed\nto act so that he will in fact act.\n\n\nThe foregoing example is representative of Marchia\u2019s thought in many\nways. He frequently draws clever and original distinctions, and the\nde possibili/de inesse division is employed in other contexts\nsuch as predestination (book I, d. 40: Marchia 2001b; see also Duba 2012). He makes\nsimilar innovative distinctions when discussing the different types of\nhuman and divine willing, where his voluntarist opinions are quite\ninteresting (Reportatio I, dd. 45\u201348: see the\ncritical edition cited below; Alliney 2006b; Robiglio\n2006). Although one could argue about the cogency of Marchia\u2019s\narguments, in the case of the de possibili/de inesse\ndistinction Marchia found a favorable response among the following,\nwho adopted the device: his Franciscan successors at Paris in the next\ndecade Aufredo Gonteri Brito, William Rubio, and William of Brienne;\nthe Augustinian Hermits Michael of Massa and Gregory of Rimini; the\narts master John the Canon; and, in the later fifteenth century,\nFernando of Cordoba and Francesco della Rovere, who was to become Pope\nSixtus IV. Thus in philosophical theology one could and often did look\nto Marchia for an alternative to Scotus and an innovative response to\nAuriol.\n3. Natural Philosophy\n\n Since the time of Pierre Duhem in the early twentieth century,\nFrancis of Marchia has been known to historians as a scientist. In\nfact, to a large extent Marchia had gained such a reputation in his\nown lifetime. It is in the question commentary on the Physics of Francis Marbres (a.k.a. John the Canon; Schabel 2014) that we find him paraphrasing Marchia on future contingents, for\nexample, and Marbres\u2019 commentary is full of references to Marchia\u2019s own\ncommentaries on the Sentences and the Metaphysics\n(Friedman-Schabel 2006, 8\u201310). Looking through the titles of Marchia\u2019s\nquestions, one finds an abundance of scientific topics related to such\nthings as the infinite and the psychology of willing\n(Friedman-Schabel, 2001). In general, Marchia displays a great\ninterest in the causal process. One thing that helps explain his\npopularity among historians of medieval science, and perhaps his own\ninterest in scientific matters, is his clear and sharp distinction\nbetween natural causation that works necessarily and the contingent\ncausation of human and divine free will. In an influential passage\ncontaining echoes of Siger of Brabant, a passage to which Anneliese\nMaier first drew attention (Scriptum I, d. 36: Maier 1949;\nMarchia 2000), Marchia explains that there are two types of\ncontingency in the world: first, there is contingency per se,\nsimpliciter, positiva, and intrinseca. This\nis the contingency by which something is still able to occur or not\noccur even when all the required accidental, natural causes have been\nposited. There is only one source of such contingency: free\nwill. Second, there is contingency per accidens, secundum\nquid, privativa, and extrinseca. This is the\ncontingency of natural causation. A natural effect takes place as the\nresult of many accidental causes. Some of these causes may be impeded\nby other natural, accidental causes, and so with respect to a small,\nlimited number of causes a natural effect may be considered\n\u2018contingent\u2019. This does not mean that the natural effect\nis really and truly contingent without qualification in the first way,\nhowever, because if we take all of the natural effect\u2019s\ncauses into account, the effect will necessarily follow, or\nnot follow, as the case may be. That is, assuming God\u2019s contingent\ncreation in the first place, and His \u2018general influence\u2019\nthat keeps the chain of causation in existence, natural causation\nworks necessarily, and so with all of an effect\u2019s causes taken\ntogether, what happens in nature is necessary. Of crucial important\nfor science is Marchia\u2019s further assertion that these\n\u2018contingent\u2019 effects can even be known by a\ncreated intellect. This is because the number of natural\ncauses is not infinite. Thus a finite, created intellect can know the\nnatural future with certainty. The only problem, says Marchia, is that\nwe humans have a short life and an intellect that is bound with the\nbody.\n\n Interestingly, one of the debates that has arisen recently\nsurrounding Marchia\u2019s scientific ideas concerns his concept of natural\ncausation and predictability. In giving an analysis similar to the one\nabove, one scholar remarked that \u201cMarchia in essence is laying down\none of the bases of modern science, at least before Heisenberg:\npredictability is theoretically obtainable in natural systems because\nnatural causes are finite and act necessarily\u201d (Marchia 2000, 22;\nSchabel 2000, 196\u20137). A second scholar replied that Marchia is\nnot a natural determinist, that for him, while \u201cgenerally it\u2019s\npossible to achieve merely the habit of foreseeing the development of\ncausal chains, \u2026 physical events happen because causes and\neffects have dispositiones or aptitudines that make\nmore probable some chains than different ones.\u201d According to this\nresponse, Marchia was more in line with \u201cHeisenberg\u2019s principle of\nindetermination\u201d than with post-Galilean physics (Zanin 2006a). It\nseems clear, however, that Marchia\u2019s analysis of\ndispositiones and aptitudines in this context is\nfocused entirely on the problem of knowing causes that are fully\ncontingent in themselves, that is, human free will, as outlined above\nin the section on\n Philosophical Theology.\n By Marchia\u2019s time, treatments of divine foreknowledge of future\ncontingents, where Marchia\u2019s discussion occurs, had become almost\nexclusively concerned with the reconciliation of human free will and\ndivine omniscience. Thus Marchia explains that the seemingly\ncontingent effects of the natural world are not the issue here, since\nthey are not really contingent at all, but necessary, given God\u2019s\ngeneral influence and understanding all natural causes taken\ntogether. Outside of human and divine free will, there are no sources\nof contingency. Indeed, the only reason the natural world can be\ncalled contingent at all is because God acts freely and contingently\nin the world as creator and sustainer, not because there is any real\ncontingency in natural causation:\n\n Everything per accidens is brought back to something per\nse; but the contingency per accidens of natural causes\ncannot be brought back to their per se necessary causality,\nbecause the causality of contingency does not follow from necessary\ncausality alone, since a contingent effect does not follow from\nnecessary causes alone; therefore this contingency per accidens\nis brought back to some per se contingency. But not to the\nper se contingency of the human will, since it is not dependent\non the human will; therefore it is brought back to the per se\ncontingency of a separate cause. Therefore the First Cause acts\ncontingently, because if it did not act contingently, nothing in\nthings would come about contingently, but all things would come about\nnecessarily. (d 36, a. 1: Marchia 2000, 34)\n\n Accordingly, were Marchia alive today, he might very well have great\nconfidence in the ability of scientists and their computers to predict\nnatural phenomena, since he would see that to some extent the\n\u201cimperfection of our intellect\u201d and the \u201cbrevity of life\u201d have been\nneutralized:\nTherefore I maintain differently that, as was said, there\nare two kinds of contingent effects: one natural, one voluntary. And\naccording to this I posit two conclusions. The first conclusion is\nthat a contingent natural effect, given the general influence of the\nFirst Cause, can be known determinately by a created intellect,\nalthough not by a human intellect, through its contingent causes. Let\nme explain: every effect that is dependent on a finite number of\ncauses necessarily bringing it about can be known determinately\nthrough its causes by some finite intellect. (This is clear, because\nsince the causes are finite, they can all be comprehended by a finite\nintellect, and if they necessarily cause the effect, the effect can be\nconcluded determinately on the basis of such causes.) But every\ncontingent natural effect is dependent on a finite number of causes\nconcurring and necessarily causing it in a finite number of ways,\ngiven [God\u2019s] general influence. Therefore, every contingent natural\neffect, given [God\u2019s] general influence, can be known determinately by\nsome finite intellect though its contingent causes... [For] although a\ncontingent effect compared to one particular cause can be impeded by\nanother natural cause, compared to the entire order of natural causes\nthat concur all at once the effect cannot be impeded by any natural\ncause. (d. 36, a. 2: Marchia 2000, 38)\n\n\nOne thing is certain: it is hard to resist comparing the scientific\nideas of a medieval scholar to those of later thinkers, even when one\nis vehemently opposed to doing so. Another debate that has arisen over\nMarchia\u2019s scientific theories further illustrates this. One of the\nmost important innovations of the mature Galileo was the assertion\nthat the celestial and terrestrial realms are made of the same\nfundamental matter and therefore follow the same basic natural\nlaws. In the book that inaugurated the renaissance, or rather birth,\nof Marchia studies, Notker Schneider declared that Francis of Marchia\nput forth a hypothesis similar to Galileo\u2019s in his commentary on book\nII of the Sentences, qq. 29\u201332 (Schneider 1991). On the basis\nof texts he himself edited, Schneider maintained that, contrary to\ncontemporary Aristotelian theory, Marchia argues that the heavens are\nnot made up of matter so completely different from terrestrial matter\nthat it radically differentiates the supralunar realm from the\nsublunar one. On the contrary, the basic matter is the same\neverywhere, and just as Marchia considers the natural world to follow\npredictable patterns, he also thinks that those patterns are\nuniversally applicable. These two tenets have important implications\nfor the practice of natural philosophy (Schneider 1991).\n\n Recently, however, it has been argued convincingly that Marchia\u2019s\nadmittedly complicated texts could be read in a different, less\nradical way. Marchia may say that at the most fundamental level the\nmatter in the celestial and the terrestrial realms is the same, since\nthey share \u201cthe same prime matter and thus the same bare\npotentiality,\u201d but practically speaking he drew such strong\ndistinctions that, since their natural potencies are different, the\nlaws applying to each are different (Thakkar 2006). In response to\nthis reinterpretation, one could point out that, even in the\npost-Galilean world, we still think that the celestial and terrestrial\nrealms are really different, just as water and air are radically\ndifferent realms on earth. The search for the luminiferous ether went\non until comparatively recently, and it is still common sense that\nobjects in deep space behave differently from those in our\natmosphere. All agree that the question for future research is whether\nand to what extent Marchia went further than his predecessors and\ncontemporaries.\n\n\nGiven these fascinating debates, it is no wonder that Marchia\u2019s\nphysical theories drew the attention of medieval and modern scholars\nalike. The first important study on Marchia\u2019s thought was Anneliese\nMaier\u2019s partial edition and analysis of book IV, q. 1, of Marchia\u2019s\nSentences commentary (Maier 1940; critical edition Marchia\n2006b; version from Vat. lat. 943 in Marchia 2006c). There Marchia\nputs forth his famous forerunner to John Buridan\u2019s impetus theory of\nprojectile motion. Aristotle had not provided a satisfactory\nexplanation for why, when we throw a ball, for example, the ball keeps\ngoing even after we have released it. Marchia\u2019s explanation was that\nwe leave behind a force in the ball \u2014 a virtus\nderelicta \u2014 that keeps the ball in motion. The fact that\nthis force was temporary rather than permanent meant that it was not\nakin to the inertia theory of classical mechanics, but, as Marchia\nstated explicitly, it was a simple theory and did explain the\nphenomena in temporary projectile motion.\n\n As part of the recent \u201cupsurge\u201d in Marchia studies, his theory of\nvirtus derelicta has also been reconsidered (Zanin 2006b;\nMarchia 2006b, 2006c). It is clear that the basic idea of a force left\nbehind had been circulating for several decades, so Marchia did not\ndevelop the theory ex nihilo. Nevertheless, Marchia appears\nto have spent much more time and energy on projectile motion than his\npredecessors. Aristotle himself did not go on at great length and in\nmuch detail, which probably explains why his theory was so flawed. It\nseems, then, that the scientific problem only became a significant\nissue among natural philosophers with Francis of Marchia. Despite its\nobvious improvement on Aristotle, before the 1330s Marchia\u2019s theory\nwas opposed by his Franciscan successor at Paris Francis of Meyronnes\nand by Meyronnes\u2019 follower Himbert of Garda, another Franciscan,\nalthough it was treated more favorably by Francis Marbres (a.k.a. John the Canon) and the\nFranciscan Nicholas of Bonet. But none of them analyzed it\nextensively. Already in the mid-1320s, however, Gerard Odonis embraced\nit wholeheartedly and in detail. Therefore, although the famous\ntheories put forth by John Buridan and Nicole Oresme in the following\ndecades in lengthy discussions differ in some ways from Marchia\u2019s, the\nsimilarities between the theories and the mere fact that Buridan and\nOresme took the issue of projectile motion so seriously surely point\nto Marchia\u2019s impact. In this way, Marchia most probably had an impact\non the development of the theory of inertia.\n\n Yet Marchia did not come up with the theory of inertia, Buridan\u2019s\ntheory of impetus, or Oresme\u2019s modifications to Buridan\u2019s\ntheory. Part of the reason for this is that Marchia presented his idea\nin the context of a discussion of the sacraments. This is not unusual\nfor Marchia: in developing his doctrine on the nature of accidents,\nfor example, the Franciscan theologian began with the miracle of the\nEucharist and modified Aristotelian metaphysics accordingly (Amerini\n2006). Thus for Marchia, projectile motion was just one of many\ninstances where a force was left behind. In essence Marchia wanted a\nunified theory of virtus derelicta that would explain a\nnumber of phenomena, including speaking, seeing, celestial motion, and\nthe conversation of the saints in heaven, in addition to the power of\nthe sacraments and projectile motion. Since some of these phenomena\nwere temporary and not permanent, exhausting themselves without\nexternal resistance, Marchia applied this to the general theory:\nvirtus derelicta is a self-expending and therefore temporary\nforce. Accordingly, Marchia believed that celestial motion was\nprobably not perpetual based on an initial virtus derelicta,\nperhaps left behind by God, although he asserted that it was at least\npossible that, in the heavens, without resistance, the virtus\nderelicta could be incorruptible. Making it a permanent force is\nthe step that Buridan would take. But Buridan was not concerned with\nall those other phenomena. For all we know, Marchia would have\napproved of Buridan\u2019s notion. As it stands, Marchia\u2019s theory,\nespecially in its particular details, \u201cis neither an Aristotelian\nsolution to the problem of projectile motion nor a new development on\nthe road to early modern science; it belongs to a new (but\nsubsequently undeveloped) understanding of motion\u201d (Zanin 2006b,\n81). Nevertheless, if we consider that Marchia appears to have been\nthe first in the West to break with Aristotle so clearly, decisively,\nand prolixly, it is more than likely that his virtus\nderelicta was Buridan\u2019s inspiration.\n\n\nPerhaps medieval scholars did not arrive at inertia because of their\nreluctance to accept and then analyze at length motion in a\nvacuum. One of Aristotle\u2019s arguments for the impossibility of a vacuum\nwas the lack of resistance of the medium. If velocity was a function\nof the proportion of force to the resistance of the medium, then with\nno resistance there would be motion in an instant, something usually\nconsidered an impossibility. In\n book II, q. 16, a. 5\n of his Sentences commentary, however, Marchia has to\nwonder why an angel, which is not a \u201ccorpus quantum,\u201d or\nbodily mass, cannot move instantaneously, i.e. from one place to\nanother without any temporal duration. Part of the answer is simply\nthat it is a contradiction to be two places at once, but Marchia adds\nthat there must be some sort of internal resistance in angels that\nmakes instantaneous motion impossible. The notion of internal\nresistance unrelated to natural place (even though no corpus\nquantum is involved) and the concept of impetus (Buridan\u2019s making\nthe virtus derelicta permanent) appear to be primitive\nversions of the ingredients of a theory of inertial mass. Since\nMarchia\u2019s writings predate those of his more famous successors, the\nOxford Calculators and Buridan and Oresme at Paris, and some of\nhis ideas at least resemble Galileo\u2019s in some way, Marchia\u2019s possible\nimpact on later scientists is a good topic for future research.\n4. Political and Social Thought\n\n With the progress of the critical edition of Marchia\u2019s\nSentences commentary, we are beginning to appreciate more\nfully his thought in philosophical theology and natural\nphilosophy. Investigating where Marchia stands in political theory has\nbeen much easier due to Mariani\u2019s publication of the\nImprobatio some fourteen years ago (Marchia 1993), probably\nwritten in the beginning of 1330. While the nature of the relationship\nbetween societal factors, on the one hand, and science and\nphilosophical theology, on the other, has long been a subject of\ncontroversy, it is clear that political thought is closely tied to the\ncircumstances of the thinker. As in the case of Ockham, circumstances\ndrove Marchia into opposition to Pope John XXII. Unlike Ockham,\nhowever, Marchia had dealt with some issues of social and political\nphilosophy in the early 1320s in book IV of his Sentences\ncommentary. In the tense climate of the struggle against Pope John at\nthe end of the decade, when Marchia\u2019s writings focused on more worldly\naffairs, he made some subtle modifications to serve his new aims\n(Lambertini 2006b). The group of scholars supporting the ex-minister\ngeneral of the Franciscans Michael of Cesena gathered at Louis of\nBavaria\u2019s court in Munich and collaborated on their anti-John XXII\ntracts. It has been shown that Marchia\u2019s Improbatio\ninfluenced Ockham\u2019s Opus nonaginta dierum (Miethke 1969;\nLambertini 2000, 2003, 2006a, 2006b) and most probably the Cesena\ngroup\u2019s Appellatio magna monacensis (Lambertini 2001). Thus,\nas in philosophical theology and natural philosophy, Marchia had an\nhistorical impact.\n\n\nThe Franciscans maintained that they lived the most perfect life\nthat was humanly possible, following the model of Christ and the\napostles who, they claimed, possessed nothing either as individuals or\nin common. John XXII not only denied that Christ and the apostles had\nno possessions, but he also declared the Franciscan position to be\nheretical. The resulting quarrel came to touch on such issues as usury,\nownership of property, disposal of property, natural and divine law and\nrights, papal infallibility, and ultimately the basis of\nsovereignty.\n\n\nOn the question on dominion, or possession, of property, Marchia\naccepted the pope\u2019s assertion that, even in the state of nature before\nthe fall, Adam had dominion over the things he used, but Marchia denied\nthat this type of dominion had much at all in common with\npost-lapsarian dominion: they are alterius generis, differing\nlike violent and natural, like corruptible and incorruptible\n(Lambertini 2000, VII). Before the fall, Adam had \u201cdominion of natural\nliberty and perfection,\u201d according to the \u201cprimaeval natural law\u201d;\nafterwards, although Marchia admitted that there was a \u201cremnant of\nnatural law,\u201d basically it had to be replaced by positive law and the\ndominion of \u201cservile necessity\u201d and the \u201cpower of compulsion.\u201d This is\nbecause, if left to his own devices, post-lapsarian man would grab all\nhe could get.\n\n\nMarchia describes the situation in the state of nature thus:\nIn the state of nature all things had been common to all\npeople, not only with respect to the dominion of things but also with\nrespect to use, whether de iure or de facto \u2014\nwith respect to use de iure because the right of using whatever was\nsuitable to them had been common to all and proper to none. (Marchia\n1993, pp. 154\u20135)\n\n Moreover, even before the creation of Eve, Adam had no dominion over\nthings that was \u201cproper\u201d to him. Therefore Pope John erred in claiming\nthat the eventual \u201cdivision of things\u201d into private possessions\nstemmed from divine law, since it came from human or positive law,\nnecessitated by human iniquity. The first division, by human law,\noccurred already with Cain and Abel before the Flood. Of course God\nrestored common dominion to Noah and his sons with the Deluge, but\nhumans and human law soon reinstated the division of goods. This was\nnot by divine will, for \u201cwhen they began to build the tower [of Babel]\nit was by human counsel, not by divine \u2014 indeed God was not\npleased.\u201d By extension, the laws of emperors and princes derive from\nhuman law, not divine, with the exception of Hebrew law in the time\nbefore Christ, a special status lost at the crucifixion.\n\n\nThe upshot is that private property is not divinely instituted, for\nMarchia: it is a human introduction. In the state of nature, by divine\nlaw, humans had a common \u201cdominion\u201d over goods, but this dominion is\nnot at all the dominion of human law, of private property. Moreover, it\nis this common dominion that Christ and the apostles followed. It is\ntherefore humanly possible to do so, indeed the best possible way to\nlive, and the Franciscans approached it more closely than anyone\nelse.\n\n\nOn the question of ecclesiastical power, of course, Marchia was also\nin disagreement with Pope John XXII (Lambertini 2000, IX). In order to\ndefend Christ\u2019s poverty and that of the Franciscans by extension,\nMarchia interpreted Christ\u2019s remark to Pilate that \u201cmy kingdom is not\nof this world\u201d as meaning not only that the origins of his kingdom and\nthe source of his power are not of this world, but also that his\nkingdom and his power are not with respect to the things of this world.\nIndeed, for Marchia, Caesar had legitimate sovereignty over this world.\nMarchia thus denied that Christ, as a man, possessed any temporal\npower, and hence he rejected John XXII\u2019s claim that Christ was\nrex and dominus in a temporal sense. The implication\nis that the pope could not inherit temporal power over the entire\nearth, although Marchia admitted that the temporal sword could pertain\nto the pope indirectly and mediately.\n\n\nGiven that the few historical surveys that have been done demonstrate\nthat Marchia had an impact on his successors in many areas of\nphilosophical thought, and given that it is only in the past twenty-five\nyears that any substantial part of his works has been available in\nprint, we can expect the flood of investigations of the ideas of this\ninteresting and important scholastic thinker to continue.\n5. Critical Editions of Texts\n\n The following texts are critical editions, using all known manuscript\nwitnesses. Distinctions 35\u201348 of book I of the\nSentences concern the unified themes of divine knowledge,\npower, and will. Marchia\u2019s Scriptum for book I ends\nprematurely at distinction 40, and distinction 39 on divine ideas is\nmuch truncated. Since distinctions 35\u201340 of the Scriptum have been\npublished (Marchia 1999, 2000, 2001b), the following texts from the\nReportatio for book I, distinctions 39, 42\u201344, and 45\u201348,\ncomplement the Scriptum material on these subjects. Since there are some differences between this text and that in Marchia 2009, the below edition has been retained.\n\n\nFrancis of Marchia,\n Reportatio in primum librum Sententiarum,\nDistinctio 39, 42\u201344, 45\u201348\n\n",
