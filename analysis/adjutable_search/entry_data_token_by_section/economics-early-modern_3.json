Hirschman (1977) argued, philosophers in early modern\nEurope went to great lengths to position commerce, banking, and the\naccumulation of wealth in a positive light, and thus overturn the\nharsh judgments of Aristotle and Aquinas. The widespread doctrine of\ndoux commerce cast the pursuit of pecuniary interests in an\ninnocent light and tamed the other more untoward passions for\npolitical power or lust. The core idea was that the love of\ngain\u2014relishing the ever-increasing pile of coins\u2014eclipsed\ninclinations for other pleasures or more indolent pursuits. This in\nturn prompted industriousness, a virtue that had already been firmly\nestablished by Hobbes and Locke, among others. Furthermore, as Locke\nhad argued, money served to reduce the affront to God in the event\nthat plums or meat were left to rot rather than brought to market.\nThat said, the modern era was a far cry from Locke\u2019s vision of\nthe American frontier. Many merchants made vast sums from importing\nluxuries\u2014coffee, tea or tobacco\u2014and some European nations\nimposed sumptuary laws or hefty taxes to reduce this trade. Several\nphilosophers argued that the consumption of luxuries was unethical,\nJoseph Butler and Claude-Adrien Helv\u00e9tius for example (see\nBerry 1994). Mandeville and Hume were two of the first to argue that\nthe economic benefits of luxuries outweighed the potential deleterious\neffects (see Susato 2006). Hume also noted that goods that had once\nbeen luxuries, such as paper, had become not just conveniences but\neven necessities. Adam Smith condemned sumptuary laws as hypocritical,\nsince the extravagant consumption by the aristocrats who set the laws\ntended to be far more ruinous to the well-being of the state (Smith\n1776 [1976: 346]).\n\nMoney-making and material advancement also rendered human actions more\npredictable and transparent. The seventeenth-century maxim that\n\u201cinterest will not lie\u201d, first coined by Henri de Rohan,\nwas in wide circulation (Hirschman 1977: 36). The self-interest axiom\nalso began to germinate in economic discourse, enhanced by appeals to\nother virtuous traits, prudence and foresight (see Force 2003).\nSelf-interest did not eclipse other-regarding traits, however, nor\nentail selfishness. While serving their pecuniary interests, merchants\nmaintained that they also served God and Country, by increasing crown\nrevenues and by taming the open seas. Merchants also prompted the rise\nof artisanal techniques and hence the growth of towns. This in turn\nprompted more mild and moderate dispositions. As Montesquieu remarked\nin the Spirit of the Laws:\n\n\nit is an almost general rule that everywhere there are gentle mores,\nthere is commerce and that everywhere there is commerce, there are\ngentle mores. (1748: [1989: 338])\n\n\nCommerce induced civility and more feminine sentiments. As Hume\nobserved of those who\n\n\nflock into cities, \u2026 both sexes meet in an easy and sociable\nmanner; and the tempers of men, as well as their behaviour, refine\napace\u2026 it is impossible but they must feel an increase of\nhumanity, from the very habit of conversing together. (\u201cOf\nRefinement in the Arts\u201d [1987: 271])\n\n\nSmith observed in his Theory of Moral Sentiments that\n\u201chumanity is the virtue of a woman\u201d, and that\n\n\namong civilized nations, the virtues which are founded upon humanity,\nare more cultivated than those which are founded upon self-denial and\nthe command of the passions. (1759 [1976: 190, 204\u20135])\n\n\nSmith, however, also expressed the worry that the European upper crust\nsuffered from excessive \u201cflattery and falsehood\u201d, and that\nthe \u201cman of fashion\u201d lacked the more esteemed\n\u201cmasculine virtues\u201d (1759 [1976: 63]). Modern commercial\nlife, for Smith, was not unequivocally for the good.\n\nIn his overview of early modern economics, Hirschman foregrounded what\nhe called the Montesquieu-Steuart doctrine, namely that international\ntrade induced global peace. Montesquieu singled out the significance\nof the bill of exchange as a critical starting point. This was an\ninternational bank order that much expanded European trade in the\nearly modern period, and constituted an extensive network of trust\nbetween the major banking families in different countries. To trade\nover great distances requires considerable coordination and\ncooperation, if only because of the need to recognize different\ncurrencies or to contract deliveries at a later point in time. The\nbill of exchange averted the risky practice of shipping silver and\ngold from one port to another, and allowed paper representations to\ncirculate and hence the expansion of credit.\n\nHobbes had already grasped that the interdependency of nations for\nbasic goods, such as Swedish timber for English wool, might lessen\ninternational conflict, particularly if nations depended on one\nanother for necessities or conveniences. Conflict stemmed from the\ndesire for imported luxury goods; these goods tended to instill a new\ntype of cupidity that would endanger peaceful trade, or so Hobbes\nbelieved (see Sorell 2006). He thus endorsed the imposition of\nsumptuary laws. Montesquieu was of a different mind. War is always\nmore destructive and more costly than trade under peaceful terms. His\nargument pivoted on an appeal to the mutual gains from trade, and the\nensuing division of labor. Hume issued other worries. He observed that\neach war of his lifetime had lasted longer, and cost more in real\nterms, than was rational given the initial objectives (\u201cOf the\nBalance of Power\u201d [1987: 339]). Insofar as much of the funding\ncame from the excessive issuance of government bonds, the mounting\npublic debt was bound to cripple the British government. The best\nmeans to avoid state bankruptcy was to overcome protectionist policies\nand promote unrestricted global trade, thereby enriching the world and\ndiminishing military conquests.\n\nHowever myopic these theories might sound\u2014given the horrific\ntreatment of African slaves and Indigenous peoples throughout the\nearly modern period, and given the bloodbath of the twentieth century\nbetween purportedly civil trading nations\u2014it is important to\nunderscore that a widespread optimism for a more peaceful and\nprosperous world characterized early modern economic thought. Immanuel\nKant\u2019s celebrated appeal to a world of perpetual peace may be\nviewed as the capstone to this long line of thought (see Nakhimovsky\n2011). As Hirschman noted, Adam Smith was the exception, for exposing\nthe monopolistic and rapacious tendencies of European merchants and\ncolonizers. Smith deplored the European treatment of African slaves\nand Indigenous peoples, not only for the inherent injustices of their\nactions, but because this tended to inculcate deplorable traits in the\ncolonizers, such as tyranny, cowardice and inhumanity (Smith 1759\n[1976: 200\u2013211]; Rothschild 2001).\n\nAbove all, Smith reduced the pursuit of wealth to mere vanity and the\ndesire for the approbation of others. There may be a trickle-down\neffect to the lower orders, or a gradual enrichment of the globe, but\nthe inherent parasitical nature of men, particularly of\nlandlords\u2014\u201cwho love to reap where they never\nsowed\u201d\u2014and the oppressive actions of the merchants ensured\nthat our world would be permanently saddled with grave injustices and\ninequalities (Smith 1776 [1976: 67]). Smith was still a far cry from\nthe stronger despairing claims of later critics of capitalism, notably\nMarx\u2019s appeal to widespread alienation, Durkheim\u2019s caveats\nabout anomie, or Keynes\u2019s ridiculing of stock market\nfrenzies (see Hirschman 1977: Part 3). Nevertheless, there is a clear\nsense in Smith that, however entrenched our practices of commerce and\ntrade, their potential to elevate humans to a kinder and better world\nbeyond mere material gratifications is severely limited (see Griswold\n1998; Hanley 2009). Smith looms large as the voice of pessimism.\n",
