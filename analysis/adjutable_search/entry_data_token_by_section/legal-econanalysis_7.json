    "main_text": "The Nature of Law || Concepts of Law\n3.1 Concepts of Law\n\nSince Dworkin\u2019s initial challenge to Hart\u2019s positivism in\nthe mid-1960s, a robust but unresolved debate over the concept of law\nhas riven the philosophy of law. Hart [1994] viewed this debate with\nsome perplexity as he thought the two sides had not engaged. More\npointedly, he thought there was nothing to argue about as he felt that\nhe and Dworkin asked two different questions; and, consequently,\nexplicated two distinct concepts of law. \n\nDworkin [1986] considered identification of the grounds of\nlaw the central question for the philosophy of law. The grounds\nof law identify the truth conditions of propositions of law. The\ndoctrinal concept of law answered this question. For him, the\njurisprudential debate thus focused on whether the grounds of law\nincluded moral principles or not. Implicitly, then, Dworkin\ninterpreted Hart [1961] as centrally addressing this doctrinal\nquestion. \n\nHart, by contrast, did not understand his project as centrally focused\non the grounds of law. Hart [1961] offered various, non-equivalent\ncharacterizations of his central task. In the first chapter, he\nsuggests as a central aim the differentiation of law from a variety of\nother phenomena, specifically morality, religion, and coercion. In the\npreface, however, Hart suggests that his study might be regarded as an\nessay in \u201cdescriptive sociology.\u201d The answer to the former\nquestion would rely on what Dworkin [2006] called a taxonomic\nconcept of law that distinguished law from other social phenomena; the\nlatter question, by contrast, demands what Dworkin [2006] called a\nsociological concept of law that furthers the aims of social\nscience.\n\nBefore identifying further concepts of law, it is important to\nunderstand how the taxonomic and the sociological concepts of law\ndiffer. A taxonomic concept of law has two functions. As noted, it\ndistinguishes legal norms in society S from other norms in that\nsociety. Second, and derivatively, it makes comparative law possible.\nComparative law must identify which rules and institutions to compare\nacross societies. A comparative study of tort law, for instance, must\nbe able to identify which norms in country X are legal norms governing\naccidents between strangers in order to compare them to the legal\nnorms governing accidents between strangers in country Y. \n\nThe sociological concept, by contrast, must serve the needs of social\ntheorists who seek to understand society and social behavior. It will\nbe a technical concept that emerges from the theory or theories that\nbest explain the phenomena the social theorist studies. Note,\nmoreover, that a social scientist might require more than one concept\nof law. Hart\u2019s descriptive sociology might be interpreted as\noffering a functional concept of law. Anthropologists, by\ncontrast, often seem more interested in an  expressive\nconcept of law. (See Pirie [2010] for a discussion that suggests an\nexpressive account of the concept of law.) \n\nThe doctrinal, taxonomic and (various) sociological concepts of law do\nnot exhaust the possible concepts that might be useful. Obviously, we\nrequire, for instance, an evaluative concept of law that\nidentifies the value of legality. Similarly, some legal philosophers,\nsuch as Raz and Coleman, understand the inquiry as an investigation of\na folk concept of law that underlies ordinary usage of the\nterm. This folk concept will differ from the other concepts of law but\nit may be influenced (or perhaps tainted) by the others, particularly\nthe doctrinal and evaluative concepts. Kornhauser [forthcoming] offers\nan achievement concept of law according to which law is a contingent\nachievement of a functioning governance system in specific\ncircumstances. It realizes some value of legality. This view is\nelaborated at greater length in section 3.3. \n\nA complex web of relations might connect these various concepts.\nHart\u2019s theory does yield a ground of law, and hence a doctrinal\nconcept, from his sociological or taxonomic concept. What makes a\nproposition of law true, for Hart, is its pedigree which must trace\nback ultimately to the rule of recognition in the community.\nSimilarly, we might create a taxonomy by considering how the grounds\nof law differ from the grounds of morality or religion. A taxonomy,\nthat is, follows directly from comparing truth conditions for\npropositions of law to truth conditions for propositions of morality.\n\n\nNo necessary relation, however, holds among the concepts. One might\nhave a sociological concept of law that does not rely on the doctrinal\nconcept of law as their grounds are very different. What makes a\nproposition of law true bears no obvious relation to what concepts\nwill shed light on questions of interest to social theorists.\n",
