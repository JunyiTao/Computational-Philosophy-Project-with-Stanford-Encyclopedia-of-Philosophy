    "main_text": "Replicating, Repeating, and Reproducing Scientific Results || An Account from the Social Sciences\n1.1 An Account from the Social Sciences\n\nSchmidt outlines five functions of replication studies in the social\nsciences:\n\nFunction 1. Controlling for sampling\nerror\u2014that is, to verify that previous results in a sample were\nnot obtained purely by chance outcomes which paint a distorted picture\nof reality\nFunction 2. Controlling for artifacts\n(internal validity)\u2014that is, ensuring that experimental results\nare a proper test of the hypothesis (i.e., have internal validity) and\ndo not reflect unintended flaws in the study design (such as when a\nmeasurement result is, say, an artifact of a faulty thermometer rather\nthan an actual change in a substance\u2019s temperature)\nFunction 3. Controlling for fraud,\nFunction 4. Enabling\ngeneralizability,\nFunction 5. Enabling verification of the\nunderlying hypothesis.\n\n\nModifying Hendrik\u2019s (1991) classes of variables that define a\nresearch space, Schmidt (2009) presents four classes of variables\nwhich may be altered or held constant in order for a given replication\nstudy to fulfil one of the above functions. The four classes are:\n\nClass 1. Information conveyed to\nparticipants (for example, their task instructions).\nClass 2. Context and background. This is a\nlarge class of variables, and it includes: participant characteristics\n(e.g., age, gender, specific history); the physical setting of the\nresearch; characteristics of the experimenter; incidental\ncharacteristics of materials (e.g., type of font, colour of the\nroom),\nClass 3. Participant recruitment, including\nselection of participants and allocation to conditions (such as\nexperimental or control conditions),\nClass 4. Dependent variable measures (or in\nSchmidt\u2019s terms \u201cprocedures for the constitution of the\ndependent variable\u201d, 2009: 93)\n\n\nSchmidt then systematically works through examples of how each\nfunction can be achieved by altering and/or holding a different class\nor classes of variable constant. For example, to fulfil the function\nof controlling for sampling error\n (Function 1),\n one should alter only variables regarding participant recruitment\n(Class 3), attempting to keep variables in all other classes as close\nto the original study as possible. To control for artefacts\n (Function 2),\n one should alter variables concerning the context and dependent\nvariable measures (variables in Classes 2 and 4 respectively), but\nkeep variables in 1 and 3 (information conveyed to participants and\nparticipant recruitment) as close to the original as possible.\nSchmidt, like most other authors in this area, acknowledges the\npractical limits of being able to hold all else constant. Controlling\nfor fraud\n (Function 3)\n is served by the same arrangements as controlling for artefacts\n (Function 2).\n In Schmidt\u2019s account, controlling for sampling error, artefacts\nand fraud (Functions 1 to 3) are connected by a theme of confirming\nthe results of the original study. Functions 4 and 5 go beyond\nthis\u2014generalizing to new populations\n (Function 4)\n which is served by changes to participant recruitment (Class 3) and\nconfirming the underlying hypothesis\n (Function 5),\n which served by changes to the information conveyed, the context and\ndependant variable measures (Classes 1, 2 and 4 respectively) but not\nchanges to participant recruitment (Class 3, although Schmidt\nacknowledges that holding the latter class of variables constant\nwhilst varying everything else is often practically impossible).\nAttempts to enable verification of the underlying research hypothesis\n(i.e., to fulfil Function 5) alone are what Schmidt classifies as\nconceptual replications, following Rosenthal (1991). Attempts\nto fulfil the other four functions are considered variants of\ndirect replications.\n\nIn summary, for Schmidt, direct replications control for sampling\nerror, artifacts, and fraud, and provide information about the\nreliability and validity of prior empirical work. Conceptual\nreplications help corroborate the underlying theory or substantive (as\nopposed to statistical) hypothesis in question and the extent to which\nthey generalize in new circumstances and situations. In practice,\ndirect and conceptual replications lie on a continuum, with\nreplication studies varying more or less compared to the original on\npotentially a great number of dimensions.\n",
