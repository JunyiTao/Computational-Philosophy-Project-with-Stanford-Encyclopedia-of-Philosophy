    "main_text": "Spectrum Inversion in an Argument\u2026 || \u2026Against Behaviorism, Functionalism, and Physicalism\n3.1 \u2026Against Behaviorism, Functionalism, and Physicalism\n\nBehaviorism in the philosophy of mind is the view that the\nmental is nothing over and above behavior (including dispositions to\nbehave). Any version of behaviorism implies that the mental supervenes\non behavior. That is: necessarily, two creatures who are behaviorally\nalike are also mentally alike. Likewise, any version of\nfunctionalism or physicalism implies that the mental\nsupervenes on, respectively, functional organization and physical\nmakeup. For the purposes of this subsection, it is not necessary to\nget into the details of these theories. However, two points should be\nnoted. First, it should not be assumed that either behavior,\nfunctional organization, or physical makeup is an intrinsic \nmatter\u2014the relevant sorts of behavioral, functional, and physical\nproperties may be extrinsic.\n In other words,\nperfect duplicates may differ in behavioral, functional, or physical\n respects.[27]\n Second, as these theories are usually\nunderstood, difference in behavioral respects implies difference in\nfunctional respects, which in turn implies difference in physical\nrespects; none of the converse implications\n holds.[28]\n So the three\nsupervenience theses just mentioned are related as follows: the\nbehaviorist supervenience thesis implies the functionalist thesis,\nwhich in turn implies the physicalist thesis.\n\n\nIf some behaviorally undetectable inverted spectrum hypothesis is\ncorrect, then there could be a pair of creatures who are behaviorally\nalike but mentally different: Invert and Nonvert are in different\nmental states when they each look at a tomato, and are behaviorally\nalike. Hence, if the inverted spectrum hypothesis is correct,\nbehaviorism is false. This gives us an argument against\nbehaviorism:\n\nArgument Aa\n\nP1a.\nThe following spectrum inversion scenario is possible: Invert\nand Nonvert are behaviorally alike, and are both looking at a\n tomato.[29]\n\nSince P1a implies that the mental does not supervene on\nbehavior:\n\nCa.\n\nBehaviorism is false.\n\n\n\nSince behaviorism is not a popular position these days, this\napplication of an inverted qualia scenario is perhaps not so\ninteresting. And given the complications discussed in subsection 2.3.1,\nthere is even room for a behaviorist to resist. However, of\nconsiderably more interest are similar arguments against functionalism\n(and physicalism). Block and Fodor (1972), who invented the terminology\nof \u2018inverted qualia\u2019, were the first to formulate an\ninverted spectrum argument against functionalism, specifically Turing\nmachine functionalism as defended in Putnam\n 1967.[30]\n Ignoring the details\nof particular functionalisms, the argument is exactly parallel to the\none against behaviorism. (Similar remarks go for the inverted spectrum\nargument against physicalism.) According to functionalism, mental\nstates are functional states: states defined by their causal role with\nrespect to inputs, outputs, and other states. So, according to\nfunctionalism, necessarily, two creatures who are functionally alike\nare also mentally alike. In order to complete the argument, an\nappropriate inverted spectrum hypothesis must be established, where\nInvert and Nonvert are functional duplicates.\n\n\nThe anti-functionalist analogue of argument Aa is:\n\nArgument Ab\n\nP1b\n\nThe following spectrum inversion scenario is possible: Invert\nand Nonvert are functionally alike, and are both looking at a\ntomato.\n\n\nSince P1b implies that the mental does not supervene on functional\norganization:\n\nCb.\n\nFunctionalism is false.\n\n\n\nThe possibility of a behaviorally undetectable inversion scenario\n(P1a) can be motivated by appeal to the sorts of considerations\ndiscussed in 2.3.1 above. However, in order to refute functionalism a\nstronger inversion hypothesis (P1b) is needed. As Block and Fodor point\nout, functionalism allows us to deny that \u201ctwo organisms\nare in the same psychological state whenever their behaviors and/or\nbehavioral dispositions are identical\u201d (1972, 86), hence avoiding\nthe stock objections to behaviorism. The functionalist, then, has no\nproblem with behaviorally undetectable inversions. But why should she\nconcede the possibility of a functionally undetectable\ninversion? The question can be made more pointed by observing that (a)\nno one has ever articulated a detailed functionalist theory of any\nmental state, and (b) any realistic version of such a theory would be\nextremely\n complicated.[31]\n In favor of the possibility of a\nfunctionally undetectable inversion, Block and Fodor offer its\n\u201cconceptual coherence\u201d:\nIt seems to us that the standard verificationist\ncounterarguments against the view that the \u2018inverted\nspectrum\u2019 [scenario] is conceptually coherent are not persuasive.\nIf this is correct, it looks as though the possibility of qualia\ninversion poses a serious prima facie argument against functionalist\naccounts of the criteria for type identity of psychological states.\n(91)\n\n\nBlock and Fodor\u2019s apparent move from the \u201cconceptual\ncoherence\u201d of the inversion scenario to its possibility can be\nquestioned. Even though one cannot know a priori that not-p (that is, p\nis conceptually coherent), p may yet be impossible. For example, one\ncannot know a priori that gold does not have the atomic number 79, but\nit is a necessary truth that gold has this atomic number. (This sort of\nseparation between conceptual coherence and possibility is not\nuncontroversial, but is commonly\n accepted.[32])\n\n\nIn any case, there are other conceptually coherent scenarios that are\nconsiderably more straightforward than an inverted spectrum scenario,\nfor example a scenario containing a conscious subject and a functional\nduplicate who is not conscious at all (a \u201czombie\u201d, in the\nphilosophical sense). So if the move from conceptual coherence to\npossibility is in fact legitimate, functionalism may be refuted by a\nsimpler argument that does not have an inversion hypothesis as a\npremise. (Shoemaker is a notable dissenter on this point; he holds\nthat while inverted spectrum scenarios are conceptually coherent,\nzombie scenarios are not. See Shoemaker 1975a, 1981, 1991.)\n\n\nA defender of the utility of an inversion scenario in an argument\nagainst functionalism might reply that the scenario\u2019s possibility does\nnot merely rest on its conceptual coherence. In addition\u2014this\nreply continues\u2014there is a positive \u201cCartesian\nintuition\u201d that such an inversion scenario is possible (a\n\u201cclear and distinct idea\u201d of the scenario, perhaps), and\nthis is prima facie evidence that it \\(is\\) possible.\n\n\nHowever, Cartesian intuition, just like conceptual coherence, is not\na very discriminating weapon, tending to spread possibility over a wide\nlandscape (cf. Tye 2003, section 4). Cartesian intuition also tends to\ncertify the possibility of scenarios containing zombies, thinking\nrocks, entirely disembodied minds (not even embodied in ectoplasm), and\nso forth\u2014all impossibilities, according to the\nfunctionalist. So, as with conceptual coherence, any inverted spectrum\nargument against functionalism that relies on Cartesian intuitions can\nbe converted into an equally plausible and simpler argument that makes\nno mention of the inverted spectrum.\n\n\nThere is one other defense of the utility of inversion scenarios in\nanti-functionalist arguments, namely that some of them are\nbiologically possible\u2014and hence not as far fetched as\nscenarios containing zombies or thinking rocks. If this is right, then\nspectrum inversion would be of special significance, since we have a\nfirmer grip on possibilities that are closer to home.\n\n\nHere is it is helpful to examine Block\u2019s Inverted Earth argument\nagainst functionalism, which at a superficial glance might not seem to\nstray beyond the constraints of Earthly biology. As we saw in\nsubsection 2.3.3, the Inverted Earth scenario is designed to avoid\ncertain objections to the usual argument from intrapersonal inversion\nhypotheses to interpersonal inversion hypotheses. How is the scenario\nturned into an argument against functionalism?\n\n\nThe brand of functionalism (about qualia) that Block sets out to\nrefute is this:\nAn experience has [\\(Q_{R}\\)] if [and\nonly if] it functions in the right way\u2014if it is caused by red\nthings in the right circumstances, and used in thought about red things\nand action with respect to red things rightly. The functional roles I\nam talking about are what I call \u2018long-arm\u2019 roles, roles\nthat include real things in the world as the inputs and outputs. They\nare to be distinguished from the \u2018short-arm\u2019 roles that\nfunctionalists sometimes prefer, roles that stop at the skin. (1990,\n58, note\n omitted)[33]\n\n\nBlock then tries to establish that after a suitable period of time\non Inverted Earth, your beliefs and judgments about the colors of\nthings would be correct: like the locals, you would believe\nthat fire hydrants are green, the sky is yellow, and so on:\n[A]ccording to me, after enough time has passed on Inverted\nEarth, your embedding in the physical and linguistic environment of\nInverted Earth would dominate, and so your intentional contents would\nshift so as to be the same as those of the natives. Consider an analogy\n(supplied by Martin Davies): if you had a Margaret Thatcher\nrecognitional capacity before your journey to Inverted Earth, and on\narriving misidentify twin MT as MT, you are mistaken. But eventually\nyour \u2018That\u2019s MT\u2019 judgements get to be about twin MT, and so\nbecome right after having started out wrong. If you were [transported]\nat age 15, by the time 50 years have passed, you use \u2018red\u2019\nto mean green, just as the natives do. (64)\n\n\n(We can also add that you know that you are on Inverted Earth, and\nmake an effort to speak the local language; see Block 1996a, 42;\n2003.)\n\n\nThis step of the argument appeals to externalism about\nmental content (Putnam 1975, Burge 1979), specifically some sort of\ncausal covariational theory (see the entry\n externalism about mental content).\nPutting the basic idea crudely: after a while on Inverted Earth certain\nof your inner states that on Earth were reliably caused by the presence\nof red things and thereby represented redness will instead be reliably\ncaused by the presence of green things, and thereby will come to\nrepresent greenness.\n\n\nThis gives us an apparent counterexample against the \u201clong\narm\u201d functionalist theory. On Inverted Earth your experiences\nhave the functional role that the functionalist theory says is\nnecessary and sufficient for possessing\n\\(Q_{R}\\): they are \u201ccaused by red things in the\nright circumstances, and used in thought about red things and action\nwith respect to red things rightly\u201d. But on Inverted Earth your\nexperiences with this functional role have\n\\(Q_{G}\\), not (or not always)\n\\(Q_{R}\\).\n\n\nIf we insist that the Inverted Earth scenario is constrained by\nactual biology, can it still be maintained that your experiences caused\nby red things on Inverted Earth have the\n\\(Q_{R}\\)-role? That is not clear, even if we\ngrant Block\u2019s claim about the \u201cshift in intentional\ncontents\u201d without a corresponding change in qualia. The problem\nis twofold. First, because of asymmetries in color space and additional\ncomplications (see footnote 23),\n to say nothing of the details of the\n\u201cinverting lenses\u201d, your total functional organization\nwould certainly change in various respects after traveling to a\nbiologically possible Inverted Earth. Second, Block\u2019s description of\nthe long-arm functional theory is highly schematic. It may be that a\nsuitably sophisticated and developed form of this theory would not have\nthe consequence that, on a biologically possible Inverted Earth, your\nexperiences caused by red things have the\n\\(Q_{R}\\)-role. Similar points go for an argument\nagainst functionalism using a traditional inverted spectrum\nscenario.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Block does not rest very much\u2014if \nany\u2014weight on the biological possibility of the Inverted Earth\nscenario:\nBut what if the facts of human physiology get in the way of\nthe case as I described it? My response is the same as the one\nmentioned earlier (based on Shoemaker\u2019s rebuttal of Harrison), namely\nthat it is possible for there to be a race of people very much like us,\nwith color vision, and color sensations, but whose physiology does not\nrule out the case described (or spectrum inversion). The functionalist\ncan hardly be satisfied with the claim that our experiences are\nfunctional states but the other race\u2019s experiences are not. (1990,\n64)\n\n\nThis response concedes that the Inverted Earth argument against\nfunctionalism may need to appeal to more-or-less outlandish\npossibilities. And if it does, then since other possibilities not\ninvolving inversions, and arguably no more outlandish, will do just as\nwell, it is doubtful that Inverted Earth-type scenarios have an\nessential role to play in arguments against\n functionalism.[34]\n\n\nThe anti-physicalist inverted spectrum argument is:\n\nArgument Ac\n\nP1c.\n\nThe following spectrum inversion scenario is possible: Invert\nand Nonvert are physically alike, and are both looking at a\ntomato.\n\nSince P1c implies that the mental does not supervene on physical\nmakeup:\n\nCc.\n\nPhysicalism is false.\n\n\n\nAlthough there is some controversy about just how science-fictional\nanti-functionalist inversion scenarios need to be,\nanti-physicalist inversion scenarios are usually supposed to\nbe very remote from actuality, and their possibility is hotly disputed.\nAlmost uncontroversially: if an inverted spectrum argument against\nphysicalism works at all, then a simple zombie scenario will equally\nserve the\n purpose.[35]\n",
