    "main_text": "Replies to Multiple Realizability Arguments: The First Forty Years || Appeals to Neuroscience\u2019s Successes\n2.3 Appeals to Neuroscience\u2019s Successes\n\nJaegwon Kim (1992) suggests, and John Bickle (1998: Chapter 4)\nemphasizes that guiding methodological principles in contemporary\nneuroscience assume continuity of underlying neural mechanisms across\nthe nervous systems of different species. This assumption informs many\nneuroscience experimental techniques and conclusions drawn from\nexperimental results. Continuity is assumed both within and across\nspecies. If radical multiple realizability of the sort championed by\nanti-reductionist philosophers actually obtained among existent\nspecies, contemporary neuroscientific experimental techniques and\npractices built upon this continuity assumption should bear little\nscientific fruit. Why experiment on the macaque visual system to\ninvestigate human visual processing, if we can\u2019t safely assume\nsome fairly strong continuity across these species? Why should\npositron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) reveal common areas of high metabolic activity during\npsychological task performance, both across and within individual\nhumans\u2014now down to less than a millimeter of spatial resolution\nin fMRI\u2014if multiple realizability were as prevalent or\nwidespread as many nonreductive philosophers assume? (see\n \u00a71.5\n above). Standard neuroscientific experimental procedures, and even\nclinical diagnostic tools widely used by practicing neurologists and\nneuropsychologists, would seem hopelessly na\u00efve in the face of common\nphilosophical assertions about the extent of multiple realizability.\nBut these procedures and tools do work, and are not hopelessly\nna\u00efve.\n\nSo Kim and Bickle draw the modus tollens conclusion, and insist that\nthese neuroscientific successes are evidence that psychological kinds\nare not as widely or as radically multiply realized in brains as many\nfunctionalists and nonreductive physicalists assume. It turns out that\neven celebrated neural plasticity is systematic within and across\nnervous systems. It has a regular progression following damage to a\nprincipal structure; there are underlying neural mechanisms that\nsubserve it, evolutionarily conserved across species. Furthermore, the\nnewly realized function following brain damage is typically seriously\ndegraded compared to initial performance. Persons can still talk,\nmanipulate spatial representations, or move their extremities, but\ntheir performances are typically qualitatively and quantitatively\nworse than normals. This fact gives rise to tricky questions about\nindividuation of psychological function. Are these alternative neural\nstructures realizing the same psychological function, the\nsame mental kind, as before, as the philosophical uses of\nmultiple realizability require? (This last response has been further\ndeveloped more recently; see\n \u00a72.4\n and\n \u00a73.1\n below.)\n\nWilliam Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale (1999) provide extensive\nempirical details about hypothesized or assumed brain type-identities\nacross species in neuroscientific practice. Their explicit target is a\nmethodological consequence sometimes drawn from the multiple\nrealizability premise: if psychological states are multiply realized\nacross biological species, then neuroscience will be of little use\ntoward understanding cognition. But as details of the neuroscience of\nvision demonstrate, neuroscientists have successfully used\nunderstanding of the brain to decompose visual function. The\nneuroscientific goal has been to\n\n\nshow how functional considerations get built into developing the\nstructural taxonomy and how that taxonomy in turn can be a heuristic\nguide in developing information-processing models. This project has\nnot been impaired by multiple realization of psychological states;\nrather, it relies on the assumption that there is a common realization\nof mechanisms for processing visual information across species. (1999:\n201)\n\n\nIt is difficult to argue against contemporary neuroscience\u2019s\nempirical successes. So even if one accepts multiple realizability in\nits original type-type form advocated by Putnam (see\n \u00a71.2\n above), Bechtel and Mundale\u2019s argument cautions against drawing\nstrong consequences from it about psychology\u2019s\nmethodological autonomy from neuroscience.\n",
