    "main_text": "Equality of Educational Opportunity as an Independent Concern || The Scarcity of High-Quality Educational Opportunity\n1.2 The Scarcity of High-Quality Educational Opportunity\n\nQuestions about the just distribution of educational opportunity are\nespecially vexing given the scarcity of resources allocated to\neducation. Although developed societies provide some education for\nfree to their citizens, funding for education is always in competition\nwith the need to provide citizens with other social goods. As Amy\nGutmann writes: \u201cThe price of using education to maximize the\nlife chances of children would be to forego these other social\ngoods\u201d (Gutmann 1999: 129). Other basic welfare needs (e.g.,\nhousing, healthcare, food), as well as cultural goods (e.g., museums,\nparks, concert halls), must be weighed against public funds allocated\nto education, thereby making high-quality education\u2014even in\nhighly productive societies\u2014scarce to some degree.\n\nThis scarcity is evident on several fronts with respect to higher\neducation in the United States, which attracts applicants from all\nover the world. There is fierce competition for admission to highly\nselective colleges and universities in the U.S. that admit fewer than\n10% of applicants. In this arena, wealthier parents sometimes go to\ngreat lengths to bolster their children\u2019s applications by paying\nfor tutoring, extracurricular activities, and admissions\ncoaching\u2014activities that can put applicants without these\nresources at a significant disadvantage in the admissions process. The\nrecent \u201cvarsity blues\u201d scandal, in which wealthy families\npaid millions of dollars to a college coach who promised admission to\nelite U.S. universities, is an extreme case in point about the degree\nof competition attached to selective universities.\n\nA more urgent demonstration of the scarcity of educational opportunity\nin the U.S. and many other societies is evident in how access to\nhigh-quality primary and secondary education is effectively limited to\nchildren whose families can afford housing in middle-class\nneighborhoods, or who have access to private schools via tuition or\nscholarships. Despite the Brown decision\u2019s eradication\nof de jure, or state-sanctioned, segregation by race in\nschools, public schools in the U.S. remain sharply segregated by race\nand by class due to de facto residential segregation. This\nsegregation has significant consequences for poor and minority\nstudents\u2019 educational opportunity. Given the strong correlation\nbetween school segregation, racial achievement gaps, and overall\nschool quality, poor and minority students are disproportionately\neducated in lower performing schools compared to their white and more\nadvantaged peers (Reardon 2015 and Reardon, Weathers, Fahle, Jang, and\nKalogrides 2022 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these systemic background\ninequalities, with prolonged school closures in the U.S.\ndisproportionately impacting low-income children who rely on schools\nto provide an array of social welfare services, including meals\n(Levinson, Cevik, and Lipsitch 2020; Levinson, Geller, and Allen,\n2021).\n\nIn view of the constellation of intrinsic and instrumental goods that\nflow from educational opportunity, and in the context of relative\nscarcity, questions about how educational resources should be\ndistributed are especially pressing as a matter of social and economic\njustice.\n",
