Broad Aims\n\nMany (perhaps all) mental states are about things, or are directed on\nto things, in the way that a belief that spring is coming is about\nspring coming, or in the way that a desire for chocolate is directed\non to chocolate. In the terminology re-introduced into philosophy by\nFranz Brentano (1874/1924), such mental states exhibit\nintentionality. Alternatively, they can be characterized as\nrepresentational states, or states with representational content.\nPrima facie, the fact that mental states have content, i.e. the fact\nthat they exhibit this particular form of directedness towards the\nworld, is rather mysterious. Teleological theories of mental content,\nlike other theories of mental content, attempt to dispel this mystery:\nthey aim to explain how mental states can be about things, directed on\nto things, or represent \n things.[1]\n\n\nIn pursuing this aim, proponents of teleological theories usually\nadopt a physicalist framework, and try to formulate a theory of\ncontent that is naturalistic, or in other words a theory that is\nconsistent with the natural sciences and their presumed working\nassumption that neither intentionality nor consciousness is\nontologically fundamental. Most teleological theories thus attempt to\nshow how intentionality, at its most fundamental, can be part of the\nnatural world, by showing how it can be understood as deriving from\nother (non-mental) natural things.\n\nIn general, it is helpful to distinguish between two key questions\nthat teleological theorists are trying to answer. First, there is the\nrepresentational status question: in virtue of what do\nrepresentational states count as representational, i.e. what makes it\nthe case that these states have some content or other, rather than\nhaving no content at all? Secondly, there is the\ncontent-determination question: in virtue of what do\nrepresentational states have the content they have, i.e. what makes it\nthe case that these states have this specific content rather\nthan some other content? A full teleological theory needs to address\nboth of these questions, although (as we will see) there has been a\ntendency in the debate to focus on the second one.\n\nOne important aspect of mental representations that a theory of mental\ncontent needs to account for is their so-called\n\u201cnormative\u201d nature. We may evaluate beliefs as true or\nfalse, memories as accurate or inaccurate, perceptions as veridical or\nillusory, desires as satisfied or not satisfied, and motor\ninstructions as correctly or incorrectly executed. The mental states\nwe evaluate in these ways count as true or false, accurate or\ninaccurate (etc.) by virtue of their contents, as well as by virtue of\nother things (such as the actual state of the world). For example, the\ntruth of a belief that today is sunny depends on whether it is sunny,\nbut also on it being a belief that today is sunny. If the content of\nthe belief were different (e.g., if it were a belief that today is\nhot) then its truth value might be different. The\n\u201cnormative\u201d nature of mental content poses at least a\nprima facie problem for all naturalistic theories of it, given the\nHumean warning against trying to derive prescriptive from descriptive\nfacts. Teleological theories share the strategy of explaining the\nnorms pertaining to mental content as deriving from so-called\nfunctional \u201cnorms\u201d, which are regarded as descriptive\nrather than prescriptive. We return to this in the next section.\n\nIn relation to the \u201cnormative\u201d nature of mental content,\nmuch attention is paid to the possibility of misrepresentation, since\nthe distinction between correct and incorrect representation is\narguably central. In fact, a capacity for misrepresentation is often\nregarded as essential for genuine representation (see esp. Grice\n1957). Some state B, for instance, can only be a belief that\ntoday is sunny if B is true when the day is sunny and false\nwhen the day is not sunny. In other words, B only\nqualifies as a representational state of this particular kind if it is\ncapable of misrepresenting the world under certain conditions. And the\nsame holds, mutatis mutandis, for representational states of most\nkinds.\n\nA distinction is sometimes made between representation of and\nrepresentation as. Whether or not teleological theories of\ncontent are concerned with representation as or of\ndepends on how those locutions are being used. Suffice it to say that\nteleological theories are generally offered as theories of referential\ncontent (i.e. of the kind of content that is tightly connected to\ntruth-, correctness- or satisfaction-conditions), rather than of\ncognitive content or mode of presentation.\n\nFurther, the proponents of teleological theories rarely believe that\nreferential content is a kind of narrow content, and so they are not\nusually offering theories of narrow content. How to characterize\nnarrow content is controversial, but the proponents of teleological\ntheories tend to agree with those who think that two beings who are\nphysical replicas at a time t \u201cfrom the skin in\u201d,\nso to speak, can differ in the referential contents of their mental\nstates at t. Of course, this view is also shared by plenty of\nother philosophers, who think that mental reference to content\nsupervenes (in part) on things that are external to the individuals\nwhose mental states are in question, such as on features of their\nsocial or physical environments and/or learning histories (perhaps for\nthe reasons given by Putnam 1975 and Burge 1979, 1986). Still, a\nteleological theory of mental reference to content could be combined\nwith the view that there is also a useful notion of narrow\ncontent. (See the entry on\n narrow mental content.)\n\nA final point about broad aims is that teleological theories of mental\ncontent are usually intended as real nature theories. Those who offer\nreal nature theories of intentional mental states think that our\neveryday ability to recognize the intentional mental states of\nourselves and others does not make us experts on the fundamental\nnature of these intentional mental states, any more than our everyday\nability to recognize water makes us experts on the fundamental nature\nof water. Teleological theories of mental content do not entail that,\nif Bill thinks that Mavis knows that today is Tuesday, then Bill must,\nin so thinking, be thinking that certain teleological functions\npertain to Mavis\u2019s cognitive system.\n2. Teleological Functions\n\nWhile teleological theories of mental content are quite diverse, they\nall share the idea that psycho-semantic norms depend, in part at\nleast, on functional norms. Later sections explain various ideas about\nthe nature of this dependence. This section describes the notion of\nfunction employed. It is generally thought to be in some sense both\nteleological and normative, but both \u201cteleological\u201d and\n\u201cnormative\u201d need qualifying, and the use of these terms\ncan lead to unnecessary misunderstandings. Let\u2019s take the first\nof these terms first.\n\nTalk of biological functions does often seem to have at least a\nteleological flavor. For example, to say that it is the function of\nthe heart to pump blood can seem equivalent to saying that hearts are\nfor pumping blood, or that hearts are there in order\nto pump blood (see esp. Wright 1973). There is also the closely\nrelated concept of an artifact\u2019s function that appears to be\npurposive: for example, when we say that moving the cursor is the\nfunction of the computer\u2019s trackpad, we might mean that this is\nwhat the trackpad was designed to do or was intended to do by the\ncomputer\u2019s designer or user. Of course, if a teleological theory\nof mental content is to be a non-circular theory of original\nintentionality, the functions to which it appeals, as grounding\noriginal intentionality, cannot in turn depend on other intentional\nphenomena. (Some, but not all, prefer to use the term\n\u201cteleonomic\u201d in that case.)\n\nThe claim that the relevant notion of function is in some sense\n\u201cnormative\u201d should also be read with care. What is meant\nby it is generally just that, when using this notion, we (and\nbiologists) may speak of systems functioning normally or properly, as\nwell as of abnormal functioning, malfunction, dysfunction, functional\nimpairment, and so on. The relevant notion of function is one that\npermits the possibility of malfunction. That is, it allows for the\npossibility that a token trait has a function to do Z (in a\nsituation S) while not doing Z (in S), or\neven while lacking the general disposition to do Z (in\n S).[2]\n For example, Joe\u2019s\npineal gland could have the function to secrete melatonin even if it\ncannot secrete melatonin because of some internal damage. Whether it\nis appropriate to describe the notion as genuinely\n\u201cnormative\u201d is unclear, since it is unclear what genuine\nnormativity requires. But all that is usually meant by saying that the\nrelevant notion of function is normative, at least by proponents of\nteleological theories of mental content, is that the relevant notion\npermits the possibility of malfunction, and underwrites the central\nfunction/dysfunction distinction employed in biology.\n\nRecall that, as mentioned earlier, the relevant functional norms are\nunderstood by proponents of teleological theories of mental content to\nbe descriptive rather than prescriptive. Some prefer to reserve the\nterm \u201cnormative\u201d for prescriptive contexts. On that way of\nspeaking, a statement would count as normative only if it entailed an\nought-claim without the addition of further premises. Proponents of\nteleological theories of mental content may all agree that no\nought-claim follows from a function ascription without the addition of\nfurther premises (for discussion, see Jacob 2001), and thus that the\nrelevant function ascriptions are not prescriptive and hence are not\ngenuinely \u201cnormative\u201d if that is what normativity\nrequires. Different terminological practices dominate different\ndiscourses, but it is worth remembering that talk of purely\ndescriptive \u201cnorms\u201d is well established in some contexts\n(e.g., in talk of statistical norms). If either psycho-semantic or\nfunctional norms were prescriptive, the attempt to naturalize them\nwould seem to ignore Hume\u2019s warning to beware trying to derive\nought-statements from is-statements, but those who\noffer teleological theories of mental content claim that the norms of\nboth functions and content fall on the is side of any\nis/ought divide.\n\nThose who favor teleological theories of content usually favor an\netiological theory of functions, according to which an item\u2019s\nfunction is determined by its history of selection or by past\nselection of things of that type. Roughly, on an etiological theory of\nfunctions, an items function is what it was selected for, or what\nthings of the type were selected for (see, e.g., Millikan 1989a and\nNeander 1991; important precursors are Ayala 1970 and Wright 1973,\n1976). This idea can be spelled out in different ways. One influential\nproposal stems from Karen Neander, who gives the following definition\nfor functions in physiology:\n\nIt is a/the proper function of an item (X) of an organism\n(O) to do that which items of X\u2019s type did to\ncontribute to the inclusive fitness of O\u2019s ancestors,\nand which caused the genotype, of which X is the phenotypic\nexpression, to be selected by natural selection. (Neander 1991, 74)\n\n\nEtiological theories of biological function need to allow for the fact\nthat ancestral traits might have been selected for something other\nthan the present function of descendent traits. For example, a\npenguin\u2019s flippers and an emu\u2019s vestigial wings no longer\nhave the function of flight, even though ancestral forelimbs were\nselected for flight. Griffiths (1993) and Godfrey-Smith (1994) offer\n\u201cmodern history\u201d versions of the etiological theory,\naccording to which functions are determined by recent selection. Note\nthat selection does not cease when traits \u201cgo to fixation\u201d\nif on-going maintenance selection is still weeding out fresh harmful\nmutations as they arise. However, selection does require some\nvariation and Schwartz (1999) suggests that a continuing usefulness\nsupplement is needed, which kicks in if variation is absent for a\ntime. In the absence of any variation, the trait retains its function\nif it is still \n adaptive.[3]\n\n\nIt is important to note that standard etiological theories do not\nentail that all functions are directly grounded in processes of\nnatural selection operating over an evolutionary span of time.\nMillikan (1984) offers a theory on which functions can also result\nfrom meme selection. Papineau (1984) speaks of learning and Dretske\n(1986) invokes functions that depend on recruitment by conditioning.\nGarson (2011, 2019a) argues that the notion of selection should be\nloosened so that differential retention without differential\nreplication could count as selection, in which case neural selection\nwould qualify as a form of selection that could underwrite\ncontent-determining functions. Finally, Millikan (1984) further\nsuggests that functions of novel items can be derived from the\nfunctions of the mechanisms that produce them. While the contents of\nsensory-perceptual representations might be determined by functions\nthat are directly grounded in processes of natural selection, it is\nplausible to suppose that the content-determining functions for (most)\nconcepts are grounded in one of the other ways.\n\nWhile etiological theories dominate the discussion of normative\nfunctions in philosophy of biology, the etiological theory is not\nuncontroversial. Some question whether teleology can be naturalized\n(e.g., Bedau 1991). Others support other theories for other reasons.\nPerhaps the systemic theory is the most popular alternative (see esp.\nCummins 1975). Systemic theories of function emphasize the role of\nfunction ascriptions in functional analyses of systems. Functional\nanalyses of systems conceptually decompose complex activities of whole\nsystems into the activities of their contributing parts. The function\nof a part is its contribution to the complex activity of the system\nthat is under analysis. Proponents of the etiological theory have no\nobjection to the idea that biologists give functional analyses of\nsystems but contend that the systemic analysis, on its own, fails to\nnaturalize the normativity of functions or to do so successfully (i.e.\nit fails to provide an adequate account of \n malfunctioning).[4] \n Some who support a systemic\ntheory argue that biology has no need for a naturalistic notion of\nmalfunction (e.g., Davies 2001), while others argue that abnormal\nfunctioning is statistically atypical (Boorse 2002, Craver 2001,\n Lewens 2004).[5]\n\n\nIt is usual to note that etiological (teleological) functions are\ndistinct from the causal-role functions involved in what is standardly\ncalled \u201cfunctionalism\u201d in philosophy of mind. Causal-role\nfunctions are often defined as a select subset of a trait\u2019s\nactual causal dispositions, and functionalism is often defined as the\nview that mental states are individuated or classified into types on\nthe basis of such dispositions (see, e.g., Block 1986). If causal-role\nfunctions are a subset of dispositions actually possessed by token\ntraits then they do not permit the possibility of an important kind of\nmalfunctioning because a trait cannot have the causal-role function to\nZ and at the same time lack the disposition to\nZ.\n\nThat said, the distinction between functionalism and what might be\ntermed \u201cteleo-functionalism\u201d is less stark than might be\nthought (cf. Neander 2017, 90). One reason is that formulations of\nclassical functionalism often spoke of the characteristic or\nnormal causal roles of mental states. Sometimes this was\nexplicitly to allow for pathology (see, e.g., Lewis 1980). Another\nreason is that, although teleological functions are often said to be\nselected effects or effects for which traits were selected, such\nfunctions can also be described as selected dispositions or\ndispositions for which traits were selected (Neander 2017, 127\u2013130;\nHundertmark 2021). Both forms of functionalism also permit multiple\nphysical realizability of traits that perform the same functions.\n3. Teleosemantic Theories\n\nWhat all teleological (or \u201cteleosemantic\u201d) theories of\nmental content have in common is the idea that psycho-semantic norms\nare ultimately derivable from functional norms. Beyond saying this, it\nis hard to give a neat definition of the group of theories that\nqualify.\n\nAn appeal to functional norms can be combined with a variety of other\nideas about content-determination. For example, there can be both\nisomorphic and informational versions of teleosemantics. In the former\ncase, the proposal might be that the relevant isomorphism is one that\ncognitive systems are supposed to exploit. In the latter case, the\ntheory might say that mental content depends on the information\ncarrying, storing or processing functions of mechanisms. (The relevant\nnotion of information is variously defined but, roughly speaking, a\ntype of state or event is said to carry information about some other\nstate or event when it is caused by it or reliably co-occurs with\nit.\n\nIt is sometimes said that the role of functions in a teleological\ntheory of content is to explain how error (misrepresentation) is\npossible, rather than to explain how content is determined (Millikan\n2004, 63), but the two go hand in hand. To see this, it helps to start\nwith the crude causal theory of content and to see how the problem of\nerror arises for it. According to the crude causal theory, a mental\nrepresentation R represents that an F is present if\nand only if Rs are always caused by an F\u2019s\nbeing present. One problem with this simple proposal is its failure to\nprovide for the possibility of misrepresentation, as Fodor (1987,\n101\u2013104) points out. To see the problem, consider a mundane case\nwhere Joan\u2019s belief that there is a cat (which is usually caused\nby cats) is caused by a small fox. The crude causal theory does not\npermit this characterization of the situation because, if a small fox\ncaused Joan\u2019s belief, then belief states of this type cannot\nrepresent that a cat is present; instead, their content must be\nsomething like a cat or a small fox is present. In other\nwords, as soon as the state of a small fox\u2019s being present\ncauses Joan\u2019s belief, it is included in the truth-conditions of\nthat (type of) belief and so, on this theory, there is no logical\nspace for the possibility of error: all candidate errors are\ntransformed into non-errors by their very occurrence. Note that the\nproblem of making room for error can also be described as the problem\nof specifying the content of representations in such a way that error\nis possible. So explaining how content is determined and how the\npossibility of error are accommodated are not separate tasks.\n\nThe error problem is an aspect of what (after Fodor) is often called\n\u201cthe disjunction problem.\u201d With respect to the crude\ncausal theory, the name applies because the theory entails disjunctive\ncontents when it should not. For example, it entails that Joan\u2019s\nbelief has (something like) the content a cat or a small fox is\npresent in the case just considered.\n\nAsking how to alter the crude causal theory to allow for error is one\nplace to begin looking for a more adequate proposal. One approach\nwould be to try to describe certain situations in which only the right\ncauses can produce the representation in question and to maintain that\nthe content of the representation is whatever can cause the\nrepresentation in such situations. This is sometimes referred to as a\n\u201ctype 1 theory.\u201d A type 1 theory distinguishes between two\ntypes of situations, ones in which only the right causes can cause a\nrepresentation (\u201ctype 1 situations\u201d) and ones in which\nother things can too (\u201ctype 2 situations\u201d) (Fodor 1990b,\n60). A type 1 theory says that the first type of situation is\ncontent-determining. A type 1 teleological theory might state, for\nexample, that the content of a perceptual representation is whatever\ncan cause it when the perceptual system is performing its proper\nfunction, or when conditions are optimal for the proper performance of\nits function. Not all teleological theories of content are type 1\ntheories, however. The theory described in the next section is\narguably a variant of a type 1 theory but some of the theories\ndescribed in later sections are not.\n\nThe following sub-sections describe some key differences among\nteleological theories. It is not possible to describe all extant\ntheories but most major approaches are sketched, along with a brief\nreview of some of their strengths and weaknesses. General objections\nto teleological theories are discussed later, in\n section 4.\n3.1 Informational Teleoemantics\n\nStampe (1977) was one of the first philosophers in modern times to\nsuggest a theory of content according to which content is a matter of\nreliable causes. Dretske\u2019s book, Knowledge and the Flow of\nInformation (1981) has also been very influential. The theory\nDretske develops in that book relies primarily on the notion of\ninformation, but he later offers a theory of content that combines\nboth informational and teleological elements (Dretske 1986, 1988,\n1995). He begins with a notion of information-carrying, which he calls\n\u201cindicating\u201d, and suggests that a representation\u2019s\ncontent is what it has the function to \n indicate.[6]\n\n\nDretske (1981) provides the most careful analysis of the indication\nrelation and he often refers back to it in his later work. However,\nthis analysis adverts to background knowledge, which is clearly an\nintentional phenomenon, so it had to be modified in order to serve as\na basis for Dretske\u2019s theory of content. The modified analysis\nruns as follows: an event token of type R indicates that a\nstate of affairs of type C obtains if and only if (i)\nC in fact obtains and (ii) the probability of\nC\u2019s obtaining, given that R is instanced, is\none (assuming that certain background or \u201cchannel\nconditions\u201d \n hold).[7]\n\n\nDretske points out that representation is not equivalent to\nindication. \u201cR indicates C\u201d entails\n\u201cC obtains\u201d, so \u201cmisindication\u201d (or\n\u201cmisinformation\u201d) is impossible. Misrepresentation, by\ncontrast, is clearly possible. So Dretske (1986) suggests that\nrepresentations are states that have the function of\nindicating. The starting idea is this: if something has the function\nof indicating something else then it is supposed to indicate it but,\nsince items don\u2019t always perform their functions, room for error\nhas been made. (The analysis of functions Dretske relies on here\nappears to be an etiological analysis of; see e.g., Dretske 1995,\n7.)\n\nHowever, Dretske (1986) sees a problem with this starting idea. He\nillustrates the problem with the case of ocean-dwelling anaerobic\nbacteria that have tiny magnets (magnetosomes) that are attracted to\nmagnetic north, which serve to direct the bacteria downwards into the\nrelatively oxygen-free sediment on the ocean floor . Plausibly, the\nfunction of the magnetosomes is to direct the bacteria to anaerobic\nconditions. If we \u201cfool\u201d the bacteria by holding a bar\nmagnet nearby and lead the bacteria upward to their death, this looks\nlike a case of natural misrepresentation. We were, in Dretske\u2019s\nwords, looking for \u201cnature\u2019s way of making a\nmistake\u201d and we seem to have found it. The problem, says\nDretske, is that it is indeterminate how we should describe the\nfunction of the magnetosomes. We can plausibly say that they have the\nfunction of indicating the oxygen-free sediment. But we can also\nplausibly say that they have the function of indicating geo-magnetic\nor even local magnetic north. If we say the latter, no\nmisrepresentation has occurred. So Dretske\u2019s interim conclusion\nis that we cannot count this as an unambiguous case of error, on his\ntheory as outlined so far.\n\nA number of distinct problems for teleological theories go under the\nname of \u201cthe functional indeterminacy problem\u201d\n (section 4.1)\n and the magnetosome example can be used to illustrate several of\nthem. However, Dretske\u2019s response to the indeterminacy problem\nthat he raised suggests that his main concern was with what is now\noften called \u201cthe problem of distal content\u201d. His problem,\nthen, is this. Suppose that we have a simple system that has just one\nway of detecting the presence of some feature of the environment. We\nhave just seen a case of this for the anaerobic bacteria have just one\nway of detecting anaerobic conditions (via the local magnetic field).\nIn such a case, if an inner state indicates the distal feature\n(anaerobic conditions) it will also indicate the more proximal feature\n(local magnetic north). Moreover, if there was selection for\nindicating the distal feature, there will also have been selection for\nindicating the more proximal feature (since the inner state indicates\nthe former by indicating the latter). Dretske further points\nout that, even if a creature has several routes by which it can detect\na given distal feature (e.g., even if the bacteria can detect\nanaerobic conditions by means of light sensors as well) there would\nstill be a disjunction of more proximal features that the\nrepresentation could count as representing, since it could still count\nas having the function of indicating the disjunction of more proximal\nfeatures (i.e., local magnetic north or reduced light).\n\nWhile we might be perfectly willing to allow that the magnetosomes in\nanaerobic bacteria do not represent or misrepresent, the problem of\ndistal content generalizes. When you see a chair across the room as a\nchair across the room, you represent it as a solid 3D object at a\ndistance from you and not as a stream of light reflected from it or as\na pattern of firings in your retinas. Otherwise you would not try to\nwalk to the chair and sit on it. An informational theory of content\nmust therefore explain how mental representations represent distal\nfeatures of the world, as opposed to the more proximal items that\ncarry information about those distal features to the representational\nsystems.\n\nDretske (1986) therefore modifies his proposal and maintains that a\ncreature that is capable of representing determinate content must be\ncapable of learning any number of new epistemic routes to the same\ndistal feature. In that case, he says, there is no closed disjunction\nof more proximal stimuli that the representation could count as\nrepresenting. He speaks of conditioning in this context. The relevant\nrepresentation is recruited by conditioning to indicate the distal\nfeature rather than the disjunction of more proximal features, because\nthere is no finite time-invariant disjunction of more proximal stimuli\nthat it has the function of indicating. However, it is controversial\nwhether the presence of such a learning mechanism would, in fact,\nsolve the distality problem (for discussion, cf. Loewer 1987 and the\nexchange between Garson 2019b and Schulte 2022).\n\nThe claim that misrepresentation is impossible without learning anyway\nseems problematic, since it appears to preclude representations\nproduced by innate input systems, such as innate sensory-perceptual\nsystems. Some psychologists also claim that some core concepts are\ninnate (e.g., see Carey 2009). Later, Dretske (1988) appears to drop\nhis conditioning requirement as a general requirement for\n(determinate) content, although he still maintains that instrumental\nconditioning or other forms of learning are necessary for acquiring\nthe kind of content that can explain \n behavior.[8]\n This re-raises the question of how representations produced by innate\ninput analyzers can have distal content.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the problem of distal content, Dretske\u2019s account\nalso faces a number of other difficulties. Some arise from his strict\ndefinition of information and the notion of \u201cchannel\nconditions\u201d (Fodor 1990c), others from the notion of a function\nto indicate/to carry information (Millikan 2004, ch. 6).\n\nDespite these problems, however, Dretske\u2019s central insight seems\nimportant and appealing. It is plausible that sensory-perceptual\nsystems have the function to produce representations that carry\ninformation and that this bears on their content. An alternative\nattempt to elaborate this insight is sketched later\n (section 3.4).\n3.2 Biosemantics and Related Views\n\nRuth Millikan and David Papineau were the first to offer teleological\ntheories of content that put a strong emphasis on how mental\nrepresentations are used within a system. In this section, we\nwill mainly focus on Millikan\u2019s \u2018biosemantics\u2019, as\nher theory is often called, while Papineau\u2019s account will be the\nsubject of the next section. Millikan presents her view in great\ndetail in her (1984) and develops it further in her (2004) and (2017,\npart II); compressed versions are provided in her (1989b) and\n(2009).\n\nThe core of Millikan\u2019s biosemantics consists of two claims. The\nfirst is that all representations are, at bottom, messages sent from a\nproducer to one or more consumers. In other words,\nrepresentations always stand midway between (i) a producer system that\nis supposed to generate them and (ii) one or more consumer systems\nthat are supposed to respond to them in specific ways. According to\nMillikan, these systems must be designed to cooperate with each other,\neither by natural selection or by a process of individual \n learning.[9]\n (Note that Millikan\u2019s\nterminology varies; in some of her writings, producers are described\nas \u2018senders\u2019, representations as \u2018intentional\nicons\u2019 or \u2018intentional signs\u2019, and consumers as\n\u2018receivers\u2019 or \u2018interpreters\u2019.)\n\nSince Millikan aims to give a fully general account of representation,\nher theory applies not only to mental representations, but also to\nrepresentational devices that are used for communication between\nindividuals, such as animal signals, linguistic utterances, and even\nmaps and graphs. In these cases, it is whole organisms that count as\nproducers and consumers. One of Millikan\u2019s standard examples is\nthe splash signal that beavers use to warn their conspecifics: the\nproducer of this representation is the beaver that splashes its tail\non the water, and the consumers are nearby beavers that react to the\nsignal by diving for cover.\n\nThe producers and consumers of mental representations, by contrast,\nare subsystems of an organism. In very simple cases, the producer is a\nparticular sensory system, and the consumer a motor system. Consider\nthe often-cited example of the frog that visually detects\nappropriately small, dark, moving objects, and responds to them by\ndarting out its tongue. In this case, the frog\u2019s visual system\ncan be described as the producer, the internal signals produced by it\nas representations, and the \u2018prey-catching system\u2019, i.e.\nthe collection of motor mechanisms that reacts to these signals by\ngenerating the tongue-darting response, as the consumer.\n\nThe second core claim of Millikan\u2019s theory, in a nutshell, is\nthis: every representation belongs to a set of interrelated\nrepresentations, and the representations of this set must correspond\nto certain other (usually external) states in a systematic way to\nenable the consumer to perform its proper functions. Or, to put it\ndifferently, (i) every representation R that is sent by a producer P\nto a consumer C belongs to a set of interrelated representations that\nP can send to C, and (ii) each representation of this set, if it is\ntokened, must \u2018map onto\u2019 (correspond to) a particular\nstate of affairs in order for C to function properly (Millikan 1984,\n96\u2013102; 1989b, 283\u2013290; and 2004, 71\u201386). The particular state that a\nrepresentation must map onto is, of course, the represented state of\naffairs, the content of this representation. (Note that,\nstrictly speaking, this formulation of Millikan\u2019s second claim\nonly covers descriptive/\u2018belief-like\u2019 representations;\nMillikan\u2019s theory of directive/\u2018desire-like\u2019\nrepresentations and her account of \u2018pushmi-pullyu\nrepresentations\u2019, i.e. of representations that are at once\ndescriptive and directive, will be omitted here. For details on\ndirective representations, cf. Millikan 1984, 96\u2013102 and 2004,\n191\u2013201; for pushmi-pullyu representations, cf. Millikan 1995.)\n\nTo unpack the second claim, let us return to the beaver splash\nexample. According to Millikan, a particular splash, produced by a\nbeaver in location l at time t, is really a complex signal, consisting\nof the splash, the time and the location. Looking at the splash signal\nin this way, we can see that it belongs to a large set of interrelated\nsignals consisting of the (same type of) splash in combination with\nmany different times and locations. Moreover, since the consumers in\nthis case are beavers that (typically) react to the signals by diving\nfor cover, it is clear that there is indeed a systematic\ncorrespondence relation that must obtain between the splash signals\nand certain states in the world in order for the consumers\u2019\nbehavior to fulfill a biological function. To put it briefly, signals\nof the form splash at location l and time t must correspond\nto states of the form danger at location l and time t: if\nthis correspondence relation obtains, the consumer beavers (often)\nescape from danger by diving for cover; if it is does not obtain, they\nmerely waste valuable energy. (This systematic correspondence\nrelationship is described as a \u2018mapping rule\u2019, a\n\u2018mapping function\u2019, or a \u2018semantic mapping\u2019 by\nMillikan.)\n\nThere are two respects, however, in which our initial formulation of\nthe second claim needs to be refined. First, we should note that in\nmost cases, a correspondence between representation and represented\nstate of affairs is not strictly necessary to enable the consumer to\nperform its proper functions; it is only necessary if the consumer is\nto perform its proper functions \u201cin the Normal way\u201d. By\nthis expression, Millikan refers to the way in which the\nconsumer\u2019s functions have generally been performed on those\noccasions that were crucial for the proliferation or preservation of\nthis (kind of) consumer (Millikan 1984, 100; 1989b, \n 286\u2013287).[10]\n Hence, to\nidentify the mapping that determines the contents for a given set of\nrepresentations R1, \u2026, Rn, we need to (i)\nlook at those past occasions where ancestral consumers of the relevant\nkind made the type of fitness contributions that led to the\nproliferation or preservation of consumers of this kind, and (ii) ask\nwhich correspondence relationships between R1, \u2026,\nRn and other states of affairs obtained in these situations\nthat help to explain how the consumers were able to make these\ncontributions. In the case of the beaver splashes, e.g., we must look\nat past occasions where the ancestors of today\u2019s beavers\nresponded to splash signals in a way that made a crucial contribution\nto their fitness (which, we may assume, are situations where they\nresponded by diving for cover), and ask which correspondence\nrelationships between the signals and other states of affairs help to\nexplain these fitness contributions. Presumably, these are precisely\nthose correspondence relationships between signals and danger that we\nhave identified above.\n\nTo incorporate this point into our formulation of Millikan\u2019s\nsecond claim, we can restate it thus: (i) every representation that is\nsent by a producer P to a consumer C belongs to a set of interrelated\nrepresentations that P can send to C, and (ii) it is a Normal\ncondition for C\u2019s performance of its proper functions that\nrepresentations of this set map onto certain other states in a\nsystematic way, i.e. according to a particular \u2018mapping\nrule\u2019.\n\nAnother respect in which Millikan\u2019s second core claim needs to\nbe refined concerns the mapping rule that relates representations to\ntheir contents. Millikan describes this relationship as an\n\u201cisomorphism\u201d or \u201chomomorphism\u201d obtaining\nbetween the set of representations on the one hand and the set of\nrepresented states of affairs on the other (Millikan 2004, ch. 6;\n2013b; 2020). The general idea is this: the mapping rule assigns to\nevery representation (of the relevant set) a represented state of\naffairs, and does so in such a manner that transformation relations\nbetween representations correspond to transformation relations between\nrepresented states affairs. This condition is fulfilled in a\nstraightforward way in the beaver splash example, where\ntransformations of a splash signal that consist in the substitution of\na particular time t* (for t) or location l*\n(for l) correspond to transformations that consist in the\nsubstitution of the very same time t* (for t)\nor location l* (for l) at the level of the represented\nstate of affairs. But it can also be fulfilled in more interesting\nways, e.g. by a set of sentences where the substitution of one name\nfor another (\u201cGinger\u201d for \u201cFred\u201d) corresponds\nto the substitution of one object for another (Ginger for\nFred) at the level of the represented states of affairs.  (For an\nin-depth discussion of this aspect of Millikan\u2019s theory,\ncf. Shea 2013.)\n\nImportantly, Millikan\u2019s second core claim is a fully general\nthesis, and is thus intended to apply to systems of representations\nthat are more complex than the system of beaver splash signals. Take\none of Millikan\u2019s favorite examples, the waggle dance of the\nhoney bee. Different waggle dances do not only vary with respect to\nthe time and place of their performance, as beaver splashes do, but\nalso with respect to the length and direction of the \u2018waggle\nrun\u2019. Furthermore, variations of the latter kind make a\nsignificant difference to the responses of the consumer bees: the\nlength and direction of their subsequent flights in search of food\nNormally depends on the length and direction of the waggle run. Hence,\nwe get a more complex mapping rule that takes us from dances with\ndifferent waggle run lengths and directions (performed in\nlocation l at time t) to states of the form nectar\nsource located in direction r at distance d (relative to location l,\nat\n time t).[11]\n This is the rule that specifies the correspondence relations that\nmust obtain between dances and nectar positions for the consumer\nbees\u2019 behavior to fulfill its biological functions (in the\nNormal way).\n\nOne aspect of Millikan\u2019s theory that has received much attention\nin the literature is the fact that it entails, at least in certain\ncases, content ascriptions of a distinctive kind. This is well\nillustrated by the frog example. Let us suppose, for the sake of\nsimplicity, that the frog\u2019s sensory-perceptual representation\nbelongs to a set of representations that only vary with respect to the\ntime and place of their occurrence, and let us call this the system of\n\u2018R-representations\u2019. To find out what the content of the\nR-representations is, according to Millikan, we must first identify\nthe proper function(s) of the frog\u2019s prey-catching system (the\nconsumer of the R-representations). Plausibly, the prey-catching\nsystem has the function of providing the frog with food, since there\ncan be no doubt that the procurement of food was the fitness-enhancing\neffect that ancestral prey-catching systems (in ancestral frogs) had\non former occasions that led to the proliferation and preservation of\nsuch systems. In a second step, we have to figure out what the\ncorrespondence relation is that has to obtain between the\nR-representations and the world if the prey-catching system is to\nperform its food-providing function in the Normal way (i.e. in the way\nthat the ancestral systems did it). The answer is, quite obviously,\nthat the correspondence relation has to obtain between\nR-representations and the presence of frog food. Hence, an\nR-representation occurring in location l at time t has the content\nthere is frog food present in l at t, rather than (say)\nthere is a fly in l at t or there is a small, dark,\nmoving object in l at t (cf. Millikan 1991, 163). (This point\nwill be discussed further in\n section 4.1.)\n\nThe central role that the representation consumer plays in this story\nhas led many interpreters to describe Millikan\u2019s theory as a\n\u2018consumer theory\u2019 or an \u2018output-oriented\nversion\u2019 of teleosemantics (see, e.g., Jacob 2000; Neander 2004;\nShea 2007). According to this interpretation, Millikan maintains that\nthe representation producer, while necessary for an item\u2019s\nrepresentational status, plays no role in determining its content,\nwhich depends exclusively on the functional nature of the relevant\nconsumer. While there are many passages in Millikan\u2019s earlier\nwritings that do indeed suggest such a view (cf. Millikan 1984, ch. 6,\nand especially Millikan 1989b), it should be noted that Millikan\nherself rejects this \n interpretation.[12]\n Moreover, it is\nclear that Millikan puts greater emphasis on the\n\u2018input-side\u2019 of representational mechanisms in her more\nrecent work, and often stresses the complementary roles of producers\nand consumers. In her (2017), for instance, she goes to some lengths\nto argue that representations which are Normally produced always carry\nnatural information about their contents (where \u2018natural\ninformation\u2019 is understood in a non-Dretskean way), and in other\nwritings, she even maintains that informational considerations of this\nkind can be employed to answer certain recalcitrant objections to her\ntheory (as we will see below). This may suggest that Millikan\u2019s\noriginal account, summarized above, must be supplemented with a claim\nabout natural information, but whether this is indeed the case is an\nissue that cannot be resolved here.\n\nSome argue that Millikan\u2019s theory has advantages in comparison\nwith Dretske\u2019s indicator semantics (see e.g., Godfrey-Smith 1989\nand Millikan 2004). On Millikan\u2019s theory, a representation\nR can represent that some environmental feature F is\npresent even if it was never the case that the presence of an\nR guaranteed the presence of an F. It suffices, on\nher theory, that Rs mapped onto Fs often enough for\nthe representation\u2019s consumers to have (so to speak) benefited\nfrom that mapping. Hence, there is no need to provide independently\nspecifiable \u201cchannel conditions\u201d for the mapping\nrelation.\n\nIt can also be argued that Millikan has solved the problem of distal\ncontent for innate as well as learned concepts. Neither retinal images\nnor light reflected from prey feed a frog. So it can be argued, in the\ncase of the frog\u2019s perceptual representations, that the Normal\ncondition for the proper functioning of its consumer (the\nprey-catching mechanism) is that the representation maps onto frog\nfood, not that it maps onto light reflected from the prey, or onto\nretinal images. \n\nOne objection that can be raised against Millikan\u2019s theory has\nto do with omnipresent beneficial background conditions. The prima\nfacie worry is whether her theory succeeds in ruling them out as\ncontents of ordinary perceptual representations. To stay with the same\nexample, consider that other things besides frog food were required\nfor a contribution to fitness on past occasions when the frog\u2019s\nperceptual representation was used by the prey-catching system (e.g.,\noxygen and gravity). Does her theory entail that the frog\u2019s\nperceptual representation has, in addition to the content there is\nfrog food, contents like the oxygen concentration is above\n18% or the local value of gravity is close to g?\nAccording to several interpreters, Millikan can easily avoid this\nconsequence. She can admit that there are many conditions that the\nfrog\u2019s representational state (state R, for short) must\ncorrespond to if the prey-catching system is to fulfill its functions,\nbut insist that it is only those conditions that are specific\nto R (i.e. that are not required, and do not Normally obtain, when R\nis absent) that constitute R\u2019s content (Shea 2005, 40; Bergman\n 2021, 3\u20134).[13]\n This would rule out conditions involving the\noxygen concentration or the value of gravity. (Interestingly, Millikan\nherself seems to favor a different answer to the problem, one that\nmirrors her reply to the next objection; cf. Millikan 1993, 127.)\n\nAnother objection to Millikan\u2019s theory is it yields content\nascriptions that are overly specific, and thus implausible. Consider\nthe fact that all sorts of circumstances could prevent a contribution\nto fitness: for example, an infected fly or a crow standing nearby\ncould spell disease or death instead of nutrition for the frog (Hall,\n1990). On this basis, Neander (1995) argues that Millikan\u2019s\ntheory has the unintended consequence that the frog\u2019s\nrepresentation has the content food that is not infected, when no\ncrow is standing by \u2026 , etc. Millikan\u2019s reply to\nthis objection (cf. Millikan 2004, 85\u201386; 2009, 404) can be summarized\nas follows: the frog\u2019s representation could only have this\nhighly specific content if the representation\u2019s\nproducer, the frog\u2019s visual system, had the function of\nproducing states that mapped onto such a highly specific state. This,\nin turn, would only be possible if the visual system were sensitive to\nproximal states that carried the information that there is food\nthat is not infected, not in the vicinity of a crow, etc.\nAccording to Millikan, however, there are no such proximal states, so\nthe objection fails (for a critical rejoinder, cf. Mart\u00ednez\n2013a, 437\u2013441). How this response relates to Millikan\u2019s\ncanonical statements of her position (e.g., in Millikan 1984, 1989b),\nand whether it indicates a departure from her original view, are\nquestions that naturally arise at this point, but they will not be\npursued further here. \n\nPietroski (1992) also argues that Millikan\u2019s theory provides\nimplausible content ascriptions, thereby entailing implausible\nintentional explanations. His tale of the kimu is intended to press\nthe point. The kimu are color-blind creatures, until a mutation arises\nwhich results in a mechanism that produces a brain state, B,\nin response to red. Those who inherit this mechanism enjoy being in\nstate B, which leads them to climb to the top of the nearest hill\nevery morning (to see the rising sun or some red flowers). The result\nis that they avoid the dawn-marauding predators, the snorf, who hunt\nin the valley below and, solely as a result of this, there is\nselection for the mutation. As Pietroski wants to describe the case,\nBs have the content there is red (or there is\nsomething red), and the desires that interact with Bs are desires\nto see something red. The point of the story is that Millikan\u2019s\ntheory does not allow us to characterize the kimu in this way. On her\ntheory, the kimu do not see a visual target as red or desire the sight\nof something red, given that it was not the mapping between\nBs and red but between Bs and snorf-free-space that\nwas crucial for the fitness of the kimu (and so for the selection of\nany relevant consumers of the representation). On Millikan\u2019s\ntheory, Bs mean snorf-free-space and there is no\nrepresentation of red in a kimu\u2019s brain.\n\nPietroski argues that biting the bullet is radically revisionist in\nthis case. Behavioral tests, he says, could support his claim. Plant a\nred flag among a crowd of snorf and the kimu will eagerly join them.\nIt is consistent with his story that contemporary kimu might never\nhave seen a snorf and might be unable to recognise one were it stood\nsmack in front of their faces. Intuitively, the kimu do not represent\nsnorf, or the absence of snorf, in any way, according to Pietroski. He\nsuggests that this might be a problem for all teleological theories of\ncontent. However, it is more specifically an objection to biosemantics\nand closely related views (some other teleological theories of content\nimply that the kimu do represent red, see\n section 3.4).\n\nMillikan (2000, 236) agrees that her theory entails that the\nkimu\u2019s B-states represent fewer snorf this way. She\nargues that we need to distinguish between the properties represented\nand the properties that cause representations. How else, she asks,\ncould a tortoise think chow this way, given that being\nnutritious is an invisible property and so could not cause a\nsensory-perceptual representation? Setting aside what a tortoise\nreally thinks, the worry is how a causal theory of content can allow\nfor the representation of that which lies behind the surface features\nof objects.\n\nPrice (2001) offers a detailed teleological theory that is similar to\nMillikan\u2019s. She defends Millikan\u2019s interpretation of the\nmind of the kimu on the ground that it better explains their behavior\n(Price 2001, 113\u2013115). She endorses the idea that the point of making\ncontent ascriptions is to rationalize behavior (as proposed, e.g., by\nDavidson 1984 and Dennett 1987), and her claim is that a desire to\navoid snorf is a better reason to climb to the top of the hill than a\ndesire to see red. Different responses are possible. First, one could\nargue that a desire to see red is reason enough to climb a hill.\nSecondly, one could also question whether it is the role of content\nascriptions to rationalize behavior, or whether this is the\ncrucial role in the context in question.\n\nIn relation to this last point, one can ask more generally if some\ncontent ascriptions are suitable for some theoretical purposes and\nothers for others. One might agree that folk psychological ascriptions\nof intentional mental states are meant to rationalize behavior but\nquestion whether this is their role in cognitive science. In the\nlatter case, the aim is to explain the psychological capacities of\nhumans and (in the case of cognitive neuroethology) other creatures.\nThus a question to ask is what content ascriptions would serve the\nexplanatory purposes of the mind and brain sciences, rather than our\nfolk psychological intuitions. Neander (2006) and Schulte (2012) argue\nthat Millikan\u2019s biosemantics generates the wrong contents for\nmainstream (information-processing) theories of perception in relation\nto the simple system cases discussed in the philosophy literature. A\nprinciple of such mainstream theories is that, in vision, the\n\u2018deeper\u2019 properties of objects that are directly relevant\nfor biological fitness are only represented after the surface features\nof objects are first represented (see, e.g., Palmer 1999). The worry\nis that biosemantics and related theories entail that, at least in\ncertain cases, it is only the \u2018deeper\u2019, beneficial\nproperties that are represented in perception.\n\nTo a large extent, Millikan\u2019s theory has been responsible for\nthe great interest, both positive and negative, that philosophers have\nshown in this general class of theories. Her writings on the topic are\nextensive and this section has only touched on the basics of her\nview.\n3.3 Desire-First Theories\n\nDavid Papineau\u2019s theory also emphasizes the \u2018use\u2019 of\nrepresentations in the production of behavioral output, but does so in\na different way than Millikan\u2019s account. In a first step,\nPapineau (1984, 1987, 1993, 1998) identifies a desire\u2019s content\nwith the effect it is supposed to produce; then, in a second step, he\nprovides an account of belief content in terms of desire content.\nHence, his theory can aptly be described as a\n\u2018desire-first\u2019 version of teleosemantics.\n\nIn a bit more detail, the theory runs as follows. According to\nPapineau, a desire\u2019s satisfaction condition is \u201cthat\neffect which it is the desire\u2019s biological purpose to\nproduce\u201d (1993, 58\u201359), by which he means that\n\u201c[s]ome past selection mechanism has favored that desire \u2013\nor, more precisely, the ability to form that type of desire \u2013 in\nvirtue of that desire producing that effect\u201d (1993, 59). So our\ndesires have the function of bringing about certain conditions \u2013\neither conditions that enhanced the fitness of our ancestors in the\ndistant past (if the selection mechanism in question was natural\nselection) or conditions that constituted a reward for us in the\nrecent past (if the selection mechanism was a mechanism of individual\nlearning). These conditions are the satisfaction conditions of our\ndesires or, in other words, their contents.\n\nThe truth condition of a belief, Papineau tells us, can (roughly) be\nequated with \u201cthat condition which guarantees that actions based\non that belief will satisfy the desires it is acting in concert\nwith\u201d (1993, 70). Suppose that I have the desire to get food\n(which is, on Papineau\u2019s view, a desire with the function of\nbringing it about that I get food), and this desire collaborates with\na certain belief B to cause me to go and look in the fridge. On\nPapineau\u2019s view, it seems that we can say that B has the content\nthat there is food in the fridge, because there being food in the\nfridge is the condition that guarantees that my desire to get food\nwill be satisfied by the action I am performing.\n\nBoth parts of Papineau\u2019s theory have been criticized. Against\nhis account of desire content, critics have raised two main types of\nobjections. First, they have proposed straightforward counterexamples\nto the account: cases where a desire has p as a satisfaction\ncondition, but where it seems that the desire cannot possibly have the\nfunction of bringing it about that p (En\u00e7 1994; Loewer 1997,\n116\u2013117). These counterexamples include entirely novel desires, like\nJohn\u2019s desire to bury his broken iPhone 12 under a Magnolia\ntree, which lack a selectional history and thus, prima facie, a\nfunction. They also include desires directed at actions that have\nnever been fitness-enhancing or rewarding, like the desire to commit\nsuicide, and desires that cannot contribute to their own satisfaction,\nlike the desire for sunny weather or the desire to change the\npast.\n\nIn reply to this line of criticism, Papineau could appeal to the\ncompositionality of desires (in the way that he appeals, in the case\nof a closely related problem, to the compositionality of beliefs; cf.\nPapineau 1993, 75 and 82\u201383). In short, he could argue that once some\nbasic desires and beliefs have content, the concepts that are the\nconstituents of these attitudes acquire contents as well (in virtue of\nthe role they play within these attitudes), and these concepts can\nthen be recombined to produce further desires which may be entirely\nnovel, incapable of contributing to their own satisfaction, or\ndirected at actions that are neither fitness-enhancing nor rewarding.\nHowever, this solution would have to be spelled out in detail in order\nto be fully convincing.\n\nA second line of objection against Papineau\u2019s account of desires\nis that it leaves desire content highly indeterminate. My desire for\nfood, for instance, usually gives rise to a whole chain of events: the\noccurrence of certain bodily movements, the ingestion of food, the\nuptake of nutrients and, ultimately, the enhancement of my biological\nfitness. Arguably, all of these events could be characterized as\n\u201ceffects which it is the desire\u2019s biological purpose to\nproduce\u201d, so it may seem that the theory does not assign a\nunique content to my desire. In a later paper, Papineau (1998, 9)\nattempts to solve this problem by saying that a desire\u2019s content\nis determined by its \u201cspecific function\u201d, where the\nspecific function of a trait is \u2018\u2018the immediate\neffect it produces at the lowest level of description where it appears\nas an unanalysed component in the functional analysis\u2019\u2019\n(Papineau 1998, 4; our \n emphasis).[14]\n This move rules out contents\nlike I induce the uptake of nutrients or I enhance my\nbiological fitness (for the desire that is, ex hypothesi, a\ndesire for food), but it is controversial whether it succeeds in fully\nresolving the indeterminacy problem (cf. Schulte 2019, 164\u2013168).\n\nPapineau\u2019s account of belief content, which is adapted from the\n\u2018success semantics\u2019 of Frank Ramsey (1927) and J.T. Whyte\n(1990), also faces some problems. The first problem is that none of\nthe actions we ordinarily perform are based on a single belief. If I\ngo to the fridge to look for food, my action is not only based on the\nbelief that there is food in the fridge, but also on my belief about\nthe location of the fridge in my apartment, about my own current\nposition, about my physical abilities, and so on. Papineau (1993, 73)\nrecognizes this problem and proposes the following solution: his\ninitial formula should be applied to sets of beliefs on which actions\nare based, and the truth-conditions of a single belief should then be\nidentified by comparing the collective truth-conditions of different\nsets which contain that belief as a member. Even if this solution\nworks, however, a second problem remains: the truth of all the beliefs\non which my action is based still does not guarantee that my\naction will be successful, not only because (for all we know) the laws\ngoverning our universe are indeterministic, but also because my\nsuccess requires that a number of background conditions hold\n(conditions involving gravity, the concentration of oxygen, etc.),\nabout which I may have no beliefs at all (Perry 1993). This suggests\nthat Papineau\u2019s account of belief content must be modified\nfurther, but it is unclear how this should be done (for two different\nproposals, cf. Blackburn 2005 and Nanay 2013).\n\nFinally, we should note that there is one respect in which\nPapineau\u2019s view has changed somewhat in recent years. In his\nearlier writings, Papineau focuses on organisms with a belief-desire\npsychology and is doubtful whether we can attribute determinate\ncontents to creatures with simpler mechanisms of behavior control\n(see, e.g., Papineau 1998, 5). In his most recent paper on the topic,\nhowever, Papineau (2016) proposes a new general account of content\nthat also applies to those simpler creatures. According to this\naccount, a representation R is always part of a producer-consumer\nsystem S, and the content of R is the condition p that ensures that\nthe behavior generated by the consumer in response to R fulfills the\nspecific function of S (Papineau 2016, 100). For organisms that\npossess beliefs and desires, the desire-first account sketched above\nstill applies, but as a special case of the more general\nproducer-consumer theory.\n3.4 Causal-Informational Theories\n\nThe problems faced by use-oriented theories like Millikan\u2019s and\nPapineau\u2019s have led some theorists to reconsider the\ninformational approach originally pioneered by Stampe and Dretske\n (section 3.1).\n One new theory that stands in this tradition is Karen Neander\u2019s\n(2013, 2017) causal-informational theory of content.\n\nNeander\u2019s starting point is the notion of a response function\n(Neander 2013; 2017, ch. 6). She claims that sensory-perceptual\nsystems have such response functions, where to \u2018respond\u2019\nto something is to be caused by it to do something else. For example,\na visual system might be caused by a red instantiation to change into\na RED state, and it might have been selected (in part) for being\ndisposed to do so. This means, according to Neander, that the system\nhas the function to respond to red instances by changing into a RED\nstate.\n\nOn Neander\u2019s view, the resulting states (like, e.g., RED) are\nrepresentations of the causes to which the system is supposed to\nrespond by producing these states. They are, so to speak,\nrepresentations of their \u2018Normal causes\u2019. On this view,\nRED has the content red is present if the visual system that\nproduces RED has the function to produce it in response to the\npresence of red, or more specifically in response to red being\ninstanced in the receptive field of the perceptual processing pathways\nresponsible for RED\u2019s production. Since\n\u2018information\u2019 is defined in causal terms by Neander, she\ncan also state her view by saying that RED has the content red is\npresent because it is supposed to carry the information that red\nis present (Neander 2017, 146). This is Neander\u2019s basic idea,\nthough two further requirements are added. One is a second-order\nsimilarity requirement (Neander 2017, ch. 8) that we will set aside\nhere.\n\nThe other is a requirement that is designed to solve the problem of\ndistal content, i.e. to exclude states that are too proximal (the\nProx-Cs, for short) from the contents of sensory representations. With\nthe addition of this requirement, Neander\u2019s analysis looks as\nfollows:\n\nA sensory-perceptual representation, R, in a\nsensory-perceptual system S, has the descriptive content\nC is present and not Prox-C is present if:\n\n\nS was selected for producing Rs in response to\nCs and,\nif S was selected for producing Rs in response\nto both Cs and Prox-Cs, it was selected for\nproducing Rs in response to Prox-Cs because this was\na means to its producing Rs in response to Cs and\nnot vice-versa (cf. Neander 2013, 34; 2017, 222).\n\n\n\nNote first that clause (1) on its own does not determine suitably\ndistal content because there is a causal chain leading from C\nto R and, if the system had been selected for responding to\nCs by producing Rs, it must also have been selected\nfor responding to the proximal items (the Prox-Cs) in the\ncausal chain (such as the light reflected from Cs toward the\nretina of the eye, in the case of visual perception). There is,\nhowever, an asymmetry, to which clause (2) appeals. The system was\nselected for its disposition to respond to the proximal items because\nby that means it responded to the more distal items, but the system\nwas not selected for responding to the more distal item because by\nthat means it responded to the more proximal items. This is why\nC, rather than one of the Prox-Cs, qualifies as the\ncontent of R.\n\nClause (1), which articulates the basic idea of Neander\u2019s\napproach, ensures different content ascriptions to those generated by\nbiosemantics and other \u2018use-oriented\u2019 theories. For\nexample, consider again the notorious case of the frog. Plausibly, the\nrelevant visual pathways in the frog\u2019s brain were selected for\ntheir disposition to be caused by a certain configuration of visible\nfeatures (roughly, something\u2019s being small, dark and moving) to\nproduce the sensory-perceptual representation in question, as well as\nfor their disposition to initiate orienting and so on thereby. They\nwere plausibly selected for this preferential response to the\nconfiguration of visible features because things with these features\nwere often enough nutritious for the frog. The visual pathways in the\nfrog were not selected for a disposition to respond to the nutritional\nvalue of a stimulus, however. For the normal frog\u2019s visual\nsystem has no causal sensitivity to the nutritional value of the\nstimulus and cannot have been selected for a causal sensitivity it did\nnot have. So, on this proposal, the visual content of the\nrepresentation is there\u2019s something small, dark, moving\n(or something along these lines) rather than there\u2019s\nfrog food. (For analogous reasons, Pietroski\u2019s kimus are\ncharacterized as representing the presence of red, not the absence of\nsnorf; cf. the discussion in\n section 3.2.)\n\nAccording to Neander (2006) the configuration of visible features is\nthe right style of visual content to ascribe for the purpose of\nmainstream scientific explanations of an anuran\u2019s visual\ncapacities (see also Neander 2017, ch. 5). Nor does this proposal seem\nto generate overly specific contents of the kind mentioned earlier in\nrelation to Millikan\u2019s biosemantics. On Neander\u2019s theory,\nthe frog does not represent the stimulus as not carrying an infectious\ndisease, even if only those small, dark and moving things that were\nnot carrying an infectious disease contributed to frog fitness when\nthe frog was fed. Sensory-perceptual systems can only have been\nselected for causal dispositions which past systems of the type\npossessed. Since past systems had no disposition to respond\npreferentially to the absence of an infectious disease in visual\nstimuli that were small, dark and moving, the fact that contributions\nto fitness were made only on those occasions when an infectious\ndisease was absent is, again, a background evolutionary fact that is\nnot content-constitutive on this proposal.\n\nOne possible concern is whether sufficient room for misrepresentation\nhas been made. Some early discussions of teleological theories of\ncontent assumed that the content of the frog\u2019s representation\nmust be there\u2019s frog food or there\u2019s a\nfly or else misrepresentation would be impossible. On\nNeander\u2019s view, the frog would not be in error when it snapped\nat something small, dark and moving that was not frog food, or not a\nfly. However, misrepresentation is possible on this proposal. A\nrepresentation that is supposed to be produced in response to\nsomething that is small, dark and moving and is instead produced in\nresponse to something large and looming would count as misrepresenting\nand a neurologically damaged frog (e.g., one with a damaged thalamus)\nwill indeed attempt to catch all sorts of inappropriate things (e.g.,\nan experimenter\u2019s hand or even the frog\u2019s own limbs).\nNeander\u2019s theory also entails that a kimu\u2019s\nB-state will misrepresent if it is tokened in response to\nanything that is not red. More importantly, perhaps, it seems to\nentail that human REDs will misrepresent if tokened in response to\nsomething not-red, as could happen in color contrast illusions or in\nunusual viewing conditions.\n\nAs Millikan (2013a) and others have pointed out, there are\nrepresentations that cannot be caused by their contents, such as\nTOMORROW. No tomorrow has ever caused a thought about tomorrow.\nHowever, TOMORROW is not a sensory-perceptual representation and so\nthis is not an objection to Neander\u2019s proposal per se. As with\nother modest theories, however, the challenge is explaining how to\nlink this modest theory for some mental contents to a more\ncomprehensive theory that accounts for all of the contents of all of\nour concepts (see also\n section 4.4).\n\nNeander\u2019s theory has been the focus of much discussion in recent\nyears. A number of critics have taken issue with Neander\u2019s\nsolution to the distality problem. Price (2014) and Artiga (2015)\nquestion whether the \u2018distality principle\u2019 (i.e. the\nsecond clause of the analysis presented above) is really consistent\nwith Neander\u2019s basic idea. Schulte (2018, 2022) defends the\nconsistency of Neander\u2019s view, but argues that it yields\nproblematic content ascriptions in certain hypothetical cases and,\narguably, also in actual cases (e.g. cases of olfactory perception).\nHe then develops a modified version of the causal-informational theory\nthat is supposed to avoid these \n consequences.[15]\n\n\nAnother aspect of Neander\u2019s theory that has been criticized is\nher causal requirement: the claim that properties can only enter into\nthe content of a sensory-perceptual representation R if they are\ncausally relevant for bringing it about that R is tokened. Green\n(2017) argues that this requirement, as spelled out by Neander (2017,\n270\u2013271), has the counterintuitive consequence that visual\nrepresentations that appear to represent an object as moving through\nadjacent regions of space (\u2018something moves from region 1 to\nregion 2 to \u2026\u2019) actually represent the successive\noccurrence of object presences in those regions (\u2018something is\nin region 1, then something is in region 2, then \u2026\u2019).\nGanson (2021a) also takes issue with the causal requirement. He\ncontends that Neander cannot accommodate distance representations that\nare generated on the basis of visual cues that are statistically, but\nnot causally related to the distance of perceived objects.\n\nWhether Neander\u2019s theory or some other version of\ncausal-informational teleosemantics can overcome these problems will\nbe a matter for future discussion.\n3.5 Other Views\n\nRecent years have seen a considerable revival of the naturalistic\nprogram in general, and teleosemantics in particular. In addition to\nnew work by Millikan, Neander and Papineau, there have been a number\nof significant contributions by other authors as well. Some of these\nare presented in this section; others, which are more closely\nconcerned with particular problems for the teleosemantic approach,\nwill be discussed in \n section 4. \n\nAmong the new approaches, one of the most influential is Nicholas\nShea\u2019s \u201cvaritel semantics\u201d, which is carefully\nworked out in his (2018). Although this theory stands firmly in the\ntradition of Millikan and Papineau, it has a number of novel and\ndistinctive features. According to Shea, representational systems are\ncharacterized by three features, which are usually found together in\nnature, and which have to do with the production of\n\u2018outcomes\u2019 (i.e. movements, actions, or the consequences\nof actions). More specifically, the outcomes produced by\nrepresentational systems are (i) \u201crobust\u201d, (ii)\n\u201cstabilized\u201d, and (iii) they are being brought about by\nmechanisms \u201cin which internal components stand in exploitable\nrelations to relevant features of the environment\u201d (Shea 2018,\n51). Let us look at these three characteristics in turn.\n\nFirst, the production of an outcome F is supposed to be\nrobust. In Shea\u2019s terminology, this means that F is\nproduced (a) \u201cin response to a range of different inputs\u201d\nand (b) \u201cin a range of different relevant external\nconditions\u201d (Shea 2018, 55). Depending on the ranges in\nquestion, the production of F can be described as more or less robust.\nOf particular importance is clause (a) of the definition, since it is\ndemanding enough to exclude certain outcomes completely. If, for\nexample, a plant closes its flowers only in response to a change in\ntemperature, then the flower-closing behavior does not qualify as a\nrobust outcome. However, if the plant also closes its flowers in\nresponse to some other input, e.g. a change in light levels, then the\nbehavior does count as (minimally) robust (Shea 2018, 213\u2013214).\n\nSecondly, the production of outcome F by system S is supposed to have\nbeen stabilized by a process of natural selection, a process of\nindividual learning, or by having contributed to the survival of S. In\nother words, F must be an etiological function of S, although it\nshould be noted that Shea expands the processes that can ground such\nfunctions by including past contributions to survival in addition to\nnatural selection and learning. (Furthermore, Shea allows that\nrepresentational systems may have design functions instead of\nstabilized functions, so stabilization is not strictly necessary for\nrepresentation; cf. Shea 2018, 64\u201365.)\n\nThirdly, the production of outcome F by system S must involve a\nmechanism with internal components (vehicles) that stand in\nexploitable relations to environmental features. In many cases, the\nexploitable relations in question are informational: the\nmechanism\u2019s internal components carry correlational information\nabout the presence of certain features in the environment (Shea 2018,\n ch. 4).[16] \n In other cases, the exploitable relations are relations\nof structural correspondence: the mechanism\u2019s internal\ncomponents stand in relations to each other that \u2018mirror\u2019\nrelations between entities in the external world (Shea 2018,\nch. 5). Furthermore, there may still be other types of exploitable\nrelations. This pluralism about the relations that are constitutive of\nrepresentational content is one of the reasons why Shea names his\napproach \u201cvaritel semantics\u201d (Shea 2018, 43). \n\nOne respect in which Shea\u2019s approach is very attractive is the\nfact that he pays close attention to the explanatory role of\nrepresentations, and offers a detailed argument for the claim that his\ntheory can account for the \u201cexplanatory purchase\u201d of\nrepresentational properties (Shea 2018, ch. 8). Another potential\nadvantage is the fact that Shea does not rely on the producer-consumer\nmodel that has long dominated in the teleosemantics literature, and\ninstead adopts a more flexible framework that allows for highly\ninterconnected representational systems that cannot be cleanly\nseparated into subsystems (Shea 2018, 19).\n\nHowever, there also several respects in which the theory may appear\nproblematic. Some critics object that Shea\u2019s way of drawing the\ndistinction between representational and non-representational systems\nis unconvincing, either because his requirements for representational\nstatus are too weak (Rescorla 2021, Kracauer 2022), or because the\ndistinction is not significant from an explanatory point of view\n(Ganson 2021b, 287). Other theorists have criticized Shea\u2019s\nclaims about the explananda (Rupert 2022) and the utility (Egan 2020)\nof representational explanations. (For replies to some of these\nobjections, cf. Shea 2020 and 2022.) Finally, given that Shea\u2019s\naccount of content determination resembles those of Millikan and\nPapineau, one may wonder whether some of their problems (especially\nthe problem of overly specific contents) are also problems for\nShea.\n\nThere is another family of views that has gained some prominence in\nrecent years, and that should be discussed in this section. What\ndistinguishes these views from standard teleosemantic theories is the\nfact that they combine a teleological theory of content with a\nnon-etiological account of function (Schroeder 2004; Nanay 2014; Bauer\n2017; Piccinini \n 2020a).[17]\n\n\nNanay\u2019s (2014) proposal, for instance, combines a broadly\nDretskean version of informational teleosemantics with Nanay\u2019s\nown modal theory of functions (Nanay 2010). Like Dretske, Nanay\nmaintains that representing something consists in \u201chaving the\nfunction to indicate (carry information about)\u201d it (Nanay 2014,\n799). However, it should be noted that he restricts this account to\n\u201cpragmatic representations\u201d, which are defined as the\nrepresentations that are most directly involved in the guidance of\nactions (Nanay 2014, 805). His account of content can thus be\nsummarized as follows: for any pragmatic representation R, R\nrepresents that p iff R has the function of indicating (carrying the\ninformation) that p. This account of content is then combined with\nNanay\u2019s modal theory of functions which says, roughly speaking,\nthat a (token) trait of an organism has the function to do X if doing\nX would contribute to the organism\u2019s fitness. Accordingly, a\nrough formulation of Nanay\u2019s theory says that a pragmatic\nrepresentation R of an organism O represents that p iff R\u2019s\nindicating (carrying the information) that p would contribute to\nO\u2019s fitness (Nanay 2014, 804). \n\nThe main advantage of Nanay\u2019s proposal is that it is a\nthoroughly non-historical account of content. As such, it avoids the\ndifficulties of standard teleosemantic accounts that arise from the\nassumption that content properties are determined by selectional\nhistory, like the Swampman problem \n (section 4.2), or problems\nconcerning our epistemic access to content properties. On the other\nhand, the modal theory of function that serves as the basis for\nNanay\u2019s account has been heavily criticized (Artiga 2014, Garson\n2019c), and there are also some more specific objections to his\ntreatment of representational content (cf. Bauer 2017; Hundertmark\n2018, 156\u2013170).\n\nA different non-etiological version of teleosemantics has recently\nbeen developed by Piccinini (2020a, 2020b). Piccinini (2020a) also\nstarts with a version of informational teleosemantics, restricted to\nsensory representations. Simplifying a bit, his account says that a\nsensory representation R has the content <p> if (i) R\u2019s\nproducer has the function of generating R so that R carries the\ninformation that p, and (ii) R can guide the agent\u2019s behavior\nwith respect to the fact that p (Piccinini 2020a, 263). (This account\nis extended to other types of representation in Piccinini 2020b.) In a\nfurther step, Piccinini combines his teleological analysis of content\nwith a so-called goal-contribution theory of function (Piccinini\n2020a, ch. 3; Maley & Piccinini 2017). This theory construes\nbiological functions as regular contributions to the (objective)\nbiological goals of an organism, where these goals include survival,\ndevelopment, reproduction and helping others (especially offspring and\nrelatives). \n\nThis theory of function is not completely ahistorical, since the\npopulation relevant for determining whether a trait makes a\nregular contribution to fitness may extend into the past\n(Maley & Piccinini 2017, 245, fn 10), but it does make functions\nmuch less dependent on historical facts than they are on etiological\naccounts. This fact may be used to argue that Piccinini\u2019s\naccount has advantages over standard teleosemantic theories when it\ncomes to problems concerning our epistemic access to contents. But\nwhether this is the case, and whether the theory can avoid the\ndifficulties that plague other non-etiological versions of\nteleosemantics, is a topic for future discussions.\n4. Problems for Teleosemantics\n\nThe preceding survey of teleological theories of content does not\nmention all of the extant teleological theories but it illustrates\nsome of the commonalities and differences among them. Now we turn to\nsome objections that have been raised against the general idea of\nteleosemantics. This section looks at the objections that have been\nmost \n influential.[18]\n Some have already been touched on in previous sections.\n4.1 Functional Indeterminacy\n\nThere are several potential indeterminacy problems (for a survey, cf.\nNeander 2017, ch. 7). In addition to the problem of distal content,\nwhich has already been discussed above two other indeterminacy\nproblems are especially prominent. \n\nThe first, raised by Fodor (1990b), is the problem of locally\nco-instantiated \n properties.[19]\n Fodor\u2019s example is the familiar case of the frog that snaps at\nanything that is suitably small, dark and moving and thereby feeds\nitself (see \n section 3.2). \n For the sake of the argument, Fodor makes\nthe (unrealistic) assumption that the property of being small, dark\nand moving and the property of being a fly are always co-instantiated\nin the frog\u2019s environment, such that all flies are small, dark,\nmoving things, and vice versa. According to Fodor, if it was adaptive\nfor the frog to snap at flies then it was equally adaptive for it to\nsnap at small, dark, moving things. Hence, when we look at the\nfrog\u2019s detection device, we can equally well say that the\nfunction of the device is to detect flies and that its\nfunction is to detect small, dark, moving things. So, if we try to\ndetermine the content of the representation by reference to the\nfunction of the detection mechanism, the content remains\nindeterminate. We can choose to describe the function one way or\nanother but if the content depends on how we choose to describe the\nfunction it is not a naturalized content. Note that the candidate\ncontents there\u2019s a fly and there\u2019s frog\nfood and there\u2019s a small, dark moving thing each\nlicense different assessments concerning misrepresentation. If the\nfrog is representing the stimulus as a fly, for instance, it will\nmisrepresent a small, dark, moving non-fly as a fly. If it represents\nthe stimulus as a small, dark, moving thing, this will not be the\ncase.\n\nThe second prominent indeterminacy problem is the problem of\nproperties mutually implicated in selection. It stems from the fact\nthat traits are selected for complex causal roles. Consider, for\nexample, an antelope population where an altered hemoglobin shape was\nselected for because it (i) increased oxygen uptake, (ii) which\nallowed the antelopes to move to higher ground, (iii) which gave them\naccess to richer pasture in summer, (iv) and so improved their\nnutritional status, their immunity to disease, their vigor in avoiding\npredation, their attraction to mates and (v) their chances of survival\nand reproduction (Neander 1995). To determine the function of a trait,\nsuch as the altered shape of the hemoglobin, the etiological theory of\nfunctions tells us to ask, \u201cwhat did past instances do that was\nadaptive and that caused traits of that type to be selected?\u201d.\nIn this case, the answer is (i) through (v). The altered shape of the\nhemoglobin did all of this, and all of this was adaptive, and all of\nthis contributed to the selection of the trait (i.e., it was selected\nfor all of this). So all of this would seem to be the\ntrait\u2019s \n function.[20]\n Its function is the complex causal role for which it was\nselected.\n\nThe problem for content can be seen when we consider mechanisms that\nproduce or consume representations. For instance, the frog\u2019s\ndetection device was selected because it (a) responded to small, dark,\nmoving things and (b) that helped the frog catch these things, and (c)\nthat provided the frog with nutrients and (d) that contributed to the\nfrog\u2019s chances of survival and reproduction in various ways.\nThus ancestral detection devices contributed to the selection of that\ntype of device by way of a complex causal route in which the visible\nconfiguration of the stimulus and the nutritional properties of the\nstimulus both play a role. Note that this does not depend on these\nfeatures of the environment being locally co-instantiated. Even if not\nall small, dark and moving things were nutritious and not all\nnutritious things were small, dark and moving in the frog\u2019s\nnatural habitat, this problem of complex causal roles would still\nremain. The problem is that the systems responsible for the production\nand the consumption of representations were selected for complex\ncausal roles in which a number of environmental features were\ninvolved.\n\nWhile these two problems might be fatal to simple teleological\ntheories of content, it is clear that the theories which are currently\nat the center of discussion have ample resources to deal with them. On\nNeander\u2019s causal-information theory, for example, the content of\nthe frog\u2019s sensory-perceptual representation is not\nindeterminate between there\u2019s a small, dark, moving\nobject, there\u2019s a fly and there\u2019s frog\nfood (whether the relevant properties are locally co-instantiated\nor not). The reason is that the frog\u2019s visual system was not\nselected for producing the relevant sensory-perceptual representation\nin response to objects of order Diptera (flies), or\nto objects with nutritional value (frog food). A frog\u2019s visual\nsystem is not causally sensitive to an object\u2019s nutritiousness,\nor to its membership in the order Diptera, and could not have\nbeen selected for a causal sensitivity it did not have (see \n section 3.4). \n The same holds, mutatis mutandis, for Millikan\u2019s\nteleological theory, which entails that the frog\u2019s\nrepresentation has the content there\u2019s frog food rather\nthan there\u2019s a fly or there\u2019s a small, dark,\nmoving object (see \n section 3.2). \n\nOf course, whether these ways of resolving the indeterminacies are\nultimately successful or whether they give rise to further, more\nserious problems is a matter of debate. Some theorists who are\nskeptical of the prospects of Neander\u2019s and Millikan\u2019s\nsolutions have thus proposed alternative answers to the problems of\ncontent indeterminacy, especially to the more serious problem of\nproperties mutually implicated in selection.\n\nNicholas Agar (1993), for instance, supports the idea that the\nfrog\u2019s representation means there\u2019s small, dark,\nmoving frog food, a content intended to incorporate all of the\nproperties causally responsible for the selection. By contrast, Manolo\nMart\u00ednez (2013) argues that it is not these properties\nthemselves that enter into the content of the frog\u2019s\nrepresentation, but the natural kind (understood as a\n\u2018homeostatic property cluster\u2019) that accounts for the\nfrequent co-instantiation of these properties. According to this\nproposal, the content of the frog\u2019s representation would be\nsomething like there\u2019s a fly. (This content ascription\nis also favored by Artiga 2019, who synthesizes Mart\u00ednez\u2019\napproach with Millikan\u2019s biosemantics, and extends it to\nrepresentations that do not refer to natural kinds.)\n\nFinally, some proponents of teleological theories do not think that\ncontent is determinate in the cases used to illustrate the alleged\nproblem. Dennett (1995) maintains that such content indeterminacy is\nunproblematic. Papineau (1998) maintains that content is indeterminate\nin the case of a creature that lacks a belief-desire psychological\nstructure (although he abandons this position later in Papineau 2016).\nMore recently, Bergman (2021) has argued that content indeterminacy in\nthe frog case is acceptable, because (i) it is a type of indeterminacy\nthat is comparatively \u2018well-behaved\u2019, more like vagueness\nthan like other, more radical forms of semantic indeterminacy and (ii)\nthere are good reasons to suppose that the indeterminacy does not\ngeneralize to the propositional attitudes of human beings. According\nto Bergman, this is an attractive position, not least because it can\nexplain why theorists continue to disagree about what the correct\ncontent ascription in the frog case is.\n4.2 Swampman\n\nAnother objection that has been influential is the Swampman objection.\nSwampman-style examples have been around for some time (Boorse 1976;\nMillikan 1984, 93). Swampman in particular was introduced by Davidson\n(1987) as a potential objection to his own historical (but not\nteleological) theory of content. When Swampman comes into existence he\nis a perfect physical replica of Davidson at a certain point in time\n(t).\n\nSwampman\u2019s history differs radically from Davidson\u2019s\nbecause he comes into existence as a result of a purely accidental\ncollision of elementary particles. Crucially, he does not partake in\nour evolutionary history or have any other evolutionary history or any\ndevelopmental history of his own. Nor is he created by God or copied\nfrom Davidson by a machine. The resemblance between Davidson and\nSwampman is nothing but a stupendous coincidence. Swampman\u2019s\nappearance of design is deceptive because he in no way derives from\nany design process, natural or intentional. Swampman\u2019s component\nparts have no functions according to an etiological theory of function\nand so his \u201cbrain\u201d states have no contents according to\nstandard teleological theories of mental content.\n\nMany people find these results highly counter-intuitive, especially\nthe result that Swampman lacks all intentional states. Assuming\nphysicalism, we could substitute Swampman for Davidson and no one,\nincluding his most intimate friends and family, would detect a\ndifference. Swampman would make noises that his friends and family\nwould interpret as witty, interesting and meaningful but, according to\nstandard teleological theories (and Davidson\u2019s own theory of\ncontent) Swampman has no ideas about philosophy, no perceptions of his\nsurroundings and no beliefs or desires about anything at all.\n\nWe have already seen that some proponents of teleosemantics avoid this\nproblem entirely by adopting a non-historical conception of function\n (section 3.5). \n For those theorists who do not want to take this route,\nthere are two broad strategies in responding to the Swampman\nobjection. One is to try to loosen the grip of the intuition that\nSwampman has intentional states and the other is to argue that any\nintuitions that remain do not show that teleological theories are\nwrong. In either case, it is important to isolate the relevant\nintuition because, by all accounts, Swampman would have much that\nDavidson had at t. All of the chemical activity in\nDavidson\u2019s brain when he understood words, for example, would\noccur in Swampman\u2019s brain-analog and certain descriptions of\nthis activity will apply to both equally: e.g., physical, chemical and\nformal descriptions of it. Further, it is trivial that Swampman has\nnarrow content if \u201cnarrow content\u201d is defined as whatever\nmost closely approximates content that nonetheless supervenes on just\nthe narrow physical states of an individual at a time and \u201cfrom\nthe skin in.\u201d By definition, whatever narrow content\nDavidson\u2019s mental states had at t, Swampman\u2019s\ninner states had too, since Swampman is at t physically\nindistinguishable \u201cfrom the skin in\u201d from Davidson at\nt. What teleological theories entail is that Swampman, no\nmatter what narrow content he has, lacks regular normative content.\nThe intuition that conflicts with teleological theories, therefore, is\nthat Swampman\u2019s inner states, which are narrowly identical to\nDavidson\u2019s, are true, false, accurate or inaccurate in the usual\nsense.\n\nThose who try to dislodge this intuition argue that an appearance of\ndesign can be misleading. (Recall that \u201cdesign\u201d here\nincludes the mechanical design-work of natural selection.) Consider,\nfor example,Swampman\u2019s eyes, or eye-analogs. It might be\nintuitive to attribute functions to them. But in nature nothing so\nintricately organized as if for the performance of a function fails to\nbe the result of a design process. It is argued that habits of\nthought, which usually take us from an appearance of design to a\nfunction ascription, lead to false ascriptions in purely hypothetical\nunrealistic cases (Neander 1991). The same habits of thought, the\nargument continues, also lead us to falsely ascribe intentionality to\nSwampman\u2019s internal states. \n\nWe might grant the point about functions and yet resist the move from\nfunctions to intentionality. The problem for theories of content, as\nopposed to theories of function, is exacerbated by the relation\nbetween intentionality and consciousness. Many philosophers find it\nplausible that an individual\u2019s phenomenal consciousness at a\ntime supervenes on just the inner physical properties of that\nindividual at that time. If this narrow supervenience thesis is true,\nthen Swampman will have phenomenal consciousness when he comes into\nexistence, assuming Davidson did at t. However, it is hard to\nsee how we can attribute phenomenal consciousness to Swampman without\nalso attributing some intentional states to him. Suppose, for example,\nthat Swampman has a red-sensation. Then presumably it will seem to him\nthat there is something red. But it seeming to him that there is\nsomething red is presumably an intentional state. (See the\nentry on \n the contents of perception.)\n\nHere we connect with another important issue that lies outside of the\nscope of this entry. However, it should be briefly noted that\nproponents of teleosemantics have several options for dealing with\nthis problem. They can either deny the narrow supervenience thesis for\nphenomenal consciousness (see, e.g., Dretske 1995) or they can argue\nthat there is no necessary connection between phenomenal consciousness\nand intentionality, i.e. that a being can be phenomenally conscious\nwithout having genuine intentional states (see, e.g., Neander 1996 and\nPapineau 2021).\n\nThe second broad strategy is to argue that Swampman intuitions cannot\nshow that teleological theories are false because they are irrelevant.\nThey are, it can be argued, not to the point if a teleological theory\nis offered as an a posteriori, real-nature theory. This strategy comes\nin two versions, which should be clearly distinguished.\n\nProponents of the first version of this strategy, e.g. Millikan (1996)\nand Neander (1996), insist that common Swampman intuitions are\nirrelevant because they are incorrect. They argue that it may\nbe natural to think that a possible being like Swampman would have\nintentional states, but that this intuitive verdict is in fact false.\nThe analogy with an a posteriori analysis of the nature of water is\nthought to be helpful here. Following Kripke and Putnam, many have\nbeen persuaded that the term \u201cwater\u201d and the concept WATER\nhave referred to H2O exclusively, even before it was known\nthat water is H2O, because there was deference to an\nunknown nature that explained the superficial properties by means of\nwhich we usually recognize instances of the liquid. On this view, it\nwas (in 1700) natural to think that there could be water without\nH2O, although this was not, in fact, metaphysically\npossible, given that water is H2O. Along similar lines, it\ncan be argued that a Swampman that has intentional states is only an\napparent, but not a genuine metaphysical possibility, and that common\nSwampman intuitions thus do not undermine standard teleosemantic\ntheories of content. (Note that the claim here is not that Swampman is\nmetaphysically impossible, but only that a Swampman with\nintentional states is.) \n\nOf course, in the case of intentionality, unlike the case of water,\nthe hidden nature or essence cannot be an inner structure, if a\nteleological theory is correct. On such a theory, intentionality is\nalleged to be an historical kind, so the previously hidden nature is\nalleged to be a matter of history. As proponents of teleological\ntheories point out, there is an apparent need for other historical\nkinds in biology (e.g., offspring, homologs and \n species).[21]\n\n\nAccording to the second version of the \u2018real nature\u2019\nstrategy, defended by Papineau (2001; 2016), the common intuitive\nverdict that Swampman would have intentional states may well be true,\nbut its truth would be irrelevant, because it does not conflict with\nthe core claims of teleosemantics (correctly understood). The idea\nhere is that Swampman\u2019s existence is a mere possibility, while\nteleosemantics is a claim about the actual world \u2013 very roughly,\nthe claim that in the actual world, intentional states are\nselectional states of a certain kind (Papineau 2001, 283\u2013284). Hence,\nthe mere possibility of a Swampman whose intentional states are not\nselectional states is perfectly compatible with the truth of\nteleosemantics.\n\nThere has been much discussion of this second strategy in recent\nyears. Some critics argue that it is undermined by actual\nSwampman-like cases (Peters 2014, Porter 2020), or by the epistemic\npossibility of such cases (Sebasti\u00e1n 2017). Braddon-Mitchell\nand Jackson (2002) have tried to show that such a version of\nteleosemantics collapses into a form of analytical functionalism.\nFurthermore, Schulte (2020, 2286\u20132288) contends that acknowledging\neven the mere possibility of a Swampman with intentional states is\nincompatible with the reductive aspirations of teleosemantics. Such\nconsiderations may lead us to reject the teleosemantic approach (at\nleast in its standard, etiological form), but they can also be taken\nas reasons to adopt the first version of the \u2018real nature\u2019\nstrategy instead of the second.\n4.3 Liberalism\n\nComplete teleosemantic theories not only say how the content of a\nstate R is determined, given that R is a representation (thereby\nanswering the content-determination question), they also say what it\ntakes for R to qualify as a representation in the first place (thereby\nanswering the representational status question). Hence, such theories\nentail claims about which systems count as possessing representational\nstates, and which do not. Accordingly, they can be criticized as\nbeing too restrictive or too liberal (or as too\nrestrictive in certain respects and too liberal in others). The\nSwampman objection, for example, aims to show that standard\nteleosemantic theories are too restrictive in one respect, since they\nentail that Swampman does not qualify as a representational system,\neven though he should.\n\nOther theorists have criticized standard teleosemantics as being too\nliberal. A very influential objection along these lines has been\nraised by Tyler Burge (2010, 303\u2013307, 315\u2013319; 2014; see also Rescorla\n2013). Burge starts from the assumption that a theory of\nrepresentation should attribute representational states to a system\nonly if such attributions have genuine explanatory value (due to the\nfact that they can figure in distinctively psychological\nexplanations). He then argues that teleosemantic theories, as well as\nall other naturalistic (\u201cdeflationary\u201d) theories,\nattribute representational states to very simple organisms, e.g. to\nplants, protists and bacteria, where it is clear that such\nattributions have no explanatory value. This leads him to conclude\nthat teleosemantic theories invariably attribute representational\nstates \u201ctoo broadly\u201d \u2013 or, in other words, that\nteleosemantic theories are too \n liberal.[22]\n\n\nNow, Burge is certainly right in claiming that many prominent\nteleosemantic theories are very liberal in attributing\nrepresentational states. Millikan\u2019s biosemantics, for instance,\narguably entails that all living beings are representational systems.\nShea\u2019s theory is not quite as liberal, but it still seems to\nimply that many plants, protists and bacteria qualify as having\nrepresentations (see \n section 3.5). \n Hence, it is no surprise that many\nproponents of teleosemantics seek to defend representational\nliberalism against Burge\u2019s criticism. Artiga (2016), for\ninstance, who endorses a radical liberalism along Millikanian lines,\naims to show that Burge\u2019s case against the explanatory value of\nrepresentational characterizations of simple organisms begs the\nquestion against teleosemantics (for discussion, cf. Schulte 2019a),\nand he also gives a positive argument for the value of such\ncharacterizations in his \n (2021).[23]\n In a similar vein, Shea (2018) argues at length that his (moderately)\nliberal theory allows us to make sense of the explanatory role of\ncontent attributions in cognitive science. \n\nOther theorists have challenged Burge\u2019s assumption that they are\ncommitted to some form of representational liberalism. Schulte (2015)\nstarts from Burge\u2019s (2010) positive thesis that it is the\npossession of sensory systems with constancy mechanisms (e.g. size\nconstancy, color constancy, shape constancy or motion constancy) that\nmarks the distinction between representational and\nnon-representational organisms. If that is right, Schulte argues, then\nthere is a natural way for proponents of teleosemantics to incorporate\nthat insight into their account: they can require producers of sensory\nrepresentations to be systems with constancy mechanisms (where this is\nspelled out in a naturalistic \n way)[24] \n and maintain that non-sensory representations presuppose the\nexistence of sensory \n ones.[25]\n By Burge\u2019s own standards, such a theory would not be\ntoo liberal. An alternative non-liberal version of teleosemantics has\nbeen proposed by Butlin (2020a): he argues that sensory\nrepresentations need not satisfy Schulte\u2019s constancy-mechanism\nrequirement as long as they have an \u2018active consumer\u2019,\ni.e. a consumer system where distinct processes are responsible for\ngenerating behavior and for coordinating behavior with environmental\nconditions.\n4.4 Sophisticated Concepts and Capacities\n\nThe weightiest objection to teleological theories of content and the\nhardest to assess is that it is unclear how such theories could\nexplain our most sophisticated concepts and cognitive \n capacities.[26]\n\n\nNo naturalistic theory of content at this time yet makes perfectly\nclear how we think about democracy, virtue, quarks or even\ncarburetors, and so this is not a problem that is peculiar to\nteleofunctional theories. However, it is sometimes argued that\nteleological theories of content have a special problem in this\nrespect (e.g., by Peacocke 1992). The thought is that they may have\nsome hope of working for contents that concern things that impact on\nfitness \u2013 food, shelter, mates, etc.\n\u2013 but that they are, in principle, unable to deal with contents\nthat cannot have impacted on fitness, or not in any suitably selective\nway. Some contents cannot have impacted on fitness because they belong\nto the future or are non-existent. Others cannot affect fitness in any\nsuitably selective way because, although they have an impact, their\nimpact is too non-specific: for example, quarks have an impact but\nbecause they are omnipresent in our environment they cannot qualify as\nthe content of a representation by virtue of some simple selectional\nstory.\n\nThis objection is hard to assess for a number of reasons. One is that\nthere are many different kinds of sophisticated concepts and\ncapacities and accounting for them all is a large task. Another is\nthat, while the objection is posed as an objection to all\nteleosemantic theories, different versions will address it in\ndifferent ways. Yet another is that we might allow that it is still\nearly days with respect to the development of teleological (and other)\nnaturalistic theories of mental content. It has really only been since\nthe advent of cognitive science in the middle of the last century and\nthe general acceptance of a broadly physicalist perspective on the\nmind in the decades that followed that philosophers of mind have\ndevoted much effort to trying to give a naturalistic theory of mental\ncontent.\n\nIn view of all of this, the present section can do little more than\noffer a few remarks about how some versions of teleosemantics make\nsome inroads on the issue. Most of the points that follow have been\ntouched on in earlier sections.\n\nIt should be emphasized that those who favor teleosemantic theories\nrarely restrict the relevant functions to those that derive from\nnatural selection operating over an evolutionary span of time. As\nremarked earlier, there might be non-intentional selection processes\nthat operate over the span of a culture or over the span of an\nindividual\u2019s own development or life. Meme selection,\nconditioning or some other forms of learning and neural selection are\nconsidered to be relevant kinds of selection by some proponents of\nteleosemantics.\n\nMillikan would in this context ask us to take note of her notions of\nderived and adapted proper functions (Millikan 1984, ch. 2). What\nMillikan refers to as a \u201cdirect proper function\u201d belongs\nto a mechanism for which there has been selection. The mechanisms that\nproduce camouflage patterns on the surface of the octopus have the\ndirect proper function to do so. The patterns that these mechanisms\nproduce by means of which they perform this function possess what\nMillikan calls a \u201cderived proper function,\u201d derived from\nthe function of the mechanism to provide camouflage. Further, a\npattern produced on a particular occasion has an \u201cadapted\nderived proper function,\u201d which is a relational function, in\nthis case to provide camouflage in that particular setting in which\nthe octopus is situated. Millikan makes use of these extended senses\nin which items may have functions to try to explain the contents of\nnovel representations and representations that are produced as a\nresult of learning. Learning mechanisms have certain functions and\nwhen they perform their functions in particular circumstances their\nproducts can have adapted derived proper functions in relation to\nthose circumstances, whether or not the circumstances obtained during\nthe history of our species.\n\nMillikan (2000) gives an extensive treatment of \n concepts.[27]\n In brief, her view is that conceptions play no role in\ndetermining the extensions of the concepts with which they are\nassociated. Millikan\u2019s theory presupposes innate learning\nmechanisms that are tuned to identify substances of different sorts in\naccord with certain principles. The relevant sort of substance is that\nwhich accounts for the past selective success of the learning\nmechanisms. For instance, some mental mechanisms might have been\nselected for recognizing faces of individuals in accord with certain\nprinciples of operation, and others might have been selected for\nrecognizing animals of different species in accord with other\nprinciples of operation. These mechanisms can acquire the\n\u201cpurpose\u201d to recognize something more specific, such as a\nparticular individual\u2019s face or animals of a particular species:\nthis is because the mechanisms were selected for recognizing things in\nthat domain (faces or animals) in accord with certain principles of\noperation and, in accord with those principles, they now have the have\nthe \u201cpurpose\u201d to recognize a particular individual\u2019s\nface or animals of a particular species. The extension of a substance\nconcept, Millikan tells us, is what substance it was selected to\nrecognize.\n\nLarge issues relevant to assessing the different teleological theories\nof content remain to be settled. On a hopeful note, much good work has\nbeen done in exploring the possible range of such theories, in\nproducing interesting in-principle objections and in responding to\nsuch objections in ways that have resulted in better developed or\nbetter defended versions. We should also keep in mind that serious\nwork on naturalistic theories of content has only been going on for\ndecades rather than centuries and that, on a philosophical timescale,\nthat is quite a short time.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abrams, M., 2005, \u201cTeleosemantics Without Natural\nSelection\u201d, <em>Biology &amp; Philosophy</em>, 20:\n97\u2013116.", "Agar, N., 1993, \u201cWhat do Frogs Really Believe?\u201d,\n<em>Australasian Journal of Philosophy</em>, 71: 1\u201312.", "Allen, C., Bekoff, M. &amp; Lauder, G.
