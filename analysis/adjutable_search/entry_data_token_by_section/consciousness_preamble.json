The\nproblem of consciousness is arguably the central issue in current\ntheorizing about the mind. Despite the lack of any agreed upon theory\nof consciousness, there is a widespread, if less than universal,\nconsensus that an adequate account of mind requires a clear\nunderstanding of it and its place in nature. We need to understand both\nwhat consciousness is and how it relates to other, nonconscious, aspects\nof reality.\n",
