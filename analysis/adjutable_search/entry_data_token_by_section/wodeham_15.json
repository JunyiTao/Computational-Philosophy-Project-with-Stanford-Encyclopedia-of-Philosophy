    "main_text": "Ethics || Moral Goodness\n7.1 Moral Goodness\n\nSince the Lectura secunda does not extend beyond book I, the\nmoral philosophy of Adam Wodeham found in book IV of the\nOrdinatio has remained relatively unexamined. However, in\n1981 Marilyn Adams and Rega Wood edited the tenth question of Book IV\nof the Ordinatio, providing us with a glimpse into\nWodeham\u2019s moral philosophy.\n\nQuestion ten concentrates on the moral worth or goodness of an action.\nHere the philosophical debate is about whether the moral worth of\naction resides in the choice of the will alone (in the manner of Kant)\nor whether moral goodness can be ascribed to the performance of\nactions themselves, independent of the intention of the agent.\nWodeham\u2019s discussion is embedded in a larger Franciscan\ndiscussion, whose main players are Scotus and Walter Chatton on the\none hand, and Ockham and Wodeham on the other.\n\nThe discussion is grounded in the distinction between purely internal\nacts (or volitional acts, acts within the power of the will) and\nexternal acts (or acts that can only be indirectly controlled by the\nwill). In the case of the latter (an external act), the power of the\nwill is not sufficient, and another source of power is needed.\nScotus\u2019s position, as understood by Wodeham, states that while\nan external act can only be good if it falls under the control of the\nwill (cf. Adams and Wood 1981, 9), the external and indirectly\ncontrolled act can nevertheless contribute an additional\nmoral goodness beyond the moral value accrued through the act of\nvolition. The result is that while willing to do the right thing or\nbad thing is in itself praiseworthy or blameworthy, executing and\nperforming that act can impute to the agent further praise or blame,\ndepending on how well one performs the willed act (cf. Adams and Wood\n1981, 9).\n\nWodeham, like Ockham, finds this position rather confusing. If someone\nperforms a morally praiseworthy volition, but this volition is not\nable to be executed, the only reason for this failure of performance\nis some impotency within the agent. But Wodeham insists that no one\nshould be damned for not doing what is not in their power to do (OO\nIV, 57\u201359, ll. 11\u201330; cf. Adams and Wood 1981, 14). Thus,\nno one can earn more merit for simply having the potency to perform\nthe action that they willed meritoriously. Having or not having the\npotency to execute that volition does not fall under the free power of\nthe agent, and, even for Scotus, only those acts that \u201care under\nthe free power of the agent\u201d are imputable acts (Adams and Wood\n1981, 9 and 14).\n",
