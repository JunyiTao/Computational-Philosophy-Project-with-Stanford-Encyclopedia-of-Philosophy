    "main_text": "Knowledge\n9. Knowledge\n\nFor Hamann, knowledge is inseparable from self-knowledge, and\nself-knowledge inseparable from knowledge of the other. We are\nvisible, as in a mirror, in each other; \u201cGod and my neighbor are\ntherefore a part of my self-knowledge, my self-love\u201d (N I,\n302:16\u201323). He writes in a letter: \u201cSelf knowledge begins with\nthe neighbor, the mirror, and just the same with true self-love; that\ngoes from the mirror to the matter\u201d (ZH 6, 281:16\u201317).\nSometimes this exploration of self-knowledge through interpersonal\nintimacy takes a sexual form, as in the Sibyl\u2019s Essay on\nMarriage (already discussed).\n\nAll forms of knowledge, of learning and development even of the most\nnatural functions, require the help of another. (The \u2018Knight of\nthe Rose Cross\u2019, while jesting with Hume, tells us ironically\nthat even eating and drinking, and indeed excretion, are not\ninstinctual or innate but require teaching.) (N III, 28:26\u201328; N\nIII, 29:7\u201310) This is conceived not only in such immediately\ninterpersonal ways, but also more widely in the context of the\ncommunity. The indispensability of \u2018the other\u2019 for\nknowledge is also the reason that Hamann gives the importance he does\nto tradition in the formation of knowledge. \u201cOur reason arises,\nat the very least, from this twofold lesson of sensuous revelations\nand human testimonies\u201d (N III 29:28\u201330). Years before\nKant\u2019s first Critique, Hamann attempts to relate the\nsenses and the understanding and their roles in knowledge, using a\ncharacteristically concrete metaphor: the senses are like the stomach,\nthe understanding like blood vessels. Not only do the blood vessels\nneed the stomach to receive the nourishment that they distribute; the\nstomach also needs the blood vessels to function. This insistence on\nthe mutual dependency and interrelation of sense experience and\nunderstanding (as opposed to many Enlightenment views that plumped for\neither reason or the senses as the dominant party) was refined in his\nengagement with Kant\u2019s critique. Throughout his life, he was\nneither materialist, purely empiricist or positivist, nor idealist,\nrationalist or intellectualist in his epistemology. Rather, he is\nfirmly against dividing knowledge or ways of knowing into different\nkinds. \u201cThe philosophers have always given truth a bill of\ndivorce, by separating what nature has joined together and vice\nversa\u201d (N III, 40: 3\u20135). With Kant\u2019s critique, the\nproblem becomes still more urgent; Kant\u2019s treatment of the issue\nis a \u201cviolent, unwarranted, obstinate divorce of what nature has\njoined together\u201d. Revising Kant\u2019s metaphor of sensibility\nand understanding as two stems of human knowledge, he suggests we see\nknowledge as a single stem with two roots. Thus he rejects the\ndivision of what can be known a priori from what can be known\na posteriori, and many of the consequences of such a stance. Here\nagain he reaches for the \u2018Principle of the Union of\nOpposites\u2019 in his deployment of imagery to suggest a different\napproach. The relation of the senses and understanding is a\n\u2018hypostatic union\u2019, a \u2018communicatio\nidiomatum\u2019 (phrases borrowed from Christian theological\ndiscussion of how the two natures of divine and human are united in\nChrist). This mysterious union can only be revealed and understood by\n\u2018ordinary language\u2019. (In suggesting that the problems in\nphilosophy can be cured by attending to \u2018ordinary\nlanguage\u2019, he clearly anticipates the late Wittgenstein).\n\nIn this engagement with Kant, Hamann returns and deepens the lesson he\nhad learnt much earlier in his reading of Hume: that belief or faith\nis an essential precursor for knowledge. Everything is dependent or\ngrounded on faith; there is no privileged position for any kind or\nform of knowledge (a priori, scientific, etc.) In Hamann\u2019s\nepistemology, the hard division between \u2018knowledge\u2019 and\n\u2018belief\u2019 or \u2018faith\u2019 becomes eroded. Both\nknowledge and faith rest on a foundation of trust; neither rest on a\nfoundation of indubitability. \u201cEvery philosophy consists of\ncertain and uncertain knowledge, of idealism and realism, of\nsensuousness and deductions. Why should only the uncertain be called\nbelief? What then are\u2014rational grounds?\u201d (ZH 7,\n165:33\u201337) \u2018Sensuousness\u2019 translates\nSinnlichkeit (Kant\u2019s \u2018sensibility\u2019). Belief\nand reason both need each other; idealism and realism are a fantasized\nopposition, of which the authentic use of reason knows nothing. The\nunity that lies in the nature of things should lie at the foundation\nof all our concepts and reflection (ZH 7, 165:7\u201317).\n",
