    "main_text": "Rhetoric, Poetics and Music\n7. Rhetoric, Poetics and Music\n\nThe titles of Theophrastus\u2019 works on rhetoric as well as their\nfew surviving fragments suggest that they were probably written to\nserve different purposes: The treatise On the Art of\nRhetoric, for instance, seems to have been rather theoretical in\nscope, Rhetorical Precepts may have been a practical guide to\ncomposing speeches, Introductions could have contained a\ncollection of sample prooemia for imitation, On Judicial\nSpeeches is likely to have been a discussion of courtroom\nspeeches. There is plenty of evidence that in this area, too,\nTheophrastus\u2019 writings were influential: they are often\nmentioned by later writers. For instance, Cicero and Quintilian take\nnotice of his contributions to rhetoric (frs. 667\u2013670\nFHS&G), his diction is cited occasionally by lexicographers (frs.\n449B, 464, 494A\u2013B FHS&G), he is repeatedly referred to as\nsomeone who wrote in an attractive manner (frs. 5B, 50\u201354, 497,\n669 FHS&G), and later rhetoricians made use of his\nCharacters for instruction in the schools (see Fortenbaugh\n2003c). It proves difficult, however, to determine Theophrastus\u2019\nown input to rhetoric, especially when compared to those of Aristotle\nand the other Peripatetics, since he seems to have been building\nextensively on their work.\n\nTheophrastus closely followed Aristotle in distinguishing between\ndeliberative, judicial and epideictic rhetoric, as well as in dividing\na speech into parts (fr. 671 FHS&G). He also distinguished between\naudience-oriented speech and fact-oriented speech; the former is\nillustrated by poetry and rhetoric, which are characterized by their\nornamented style, while the latter is illustrated by philosophy, which\nis concerned with truth and methods of argument (fr. 78 FHS&G).\nAlthough the originality of this classification and his acceptance of\nthe legitimacy of affective prose may be limited to a simple\nmodification of Aristotle\u2019s views, Theophrastus thus managed to\neliminate the last traces of Plato\u2019s hostility to rhetoric. In\nhis treatise On Style, on the other hand, he seems to have\ntried to improve over the Aristotelian tripartite division of good\nstyle into clarity, appropriateness and ornamentation\n(Rhetoric 3.2\u201312), by adding a fourth virtue of speech,\nnamely that of speaking correct Greek (hellenismos), which he\nplaces before the others; it is likely that his interest in it\nreflects the development at the time of grammar as an independent\nsubject. So, it is the combination of precisely these four qualities\nthat is meant, according to Theophrastus, to achieve in style the\ndesired mean, which he also advocated in diction, rhythm and sentence\nstructure (see Innes 1985).\n\nConcerning rhetorical delivery, Theophrastus gave the subject\nrecognition and paid more attention to the actual performance than\nAristotle had done before him. It is true, of course, that Aristotle\ntouched on delivery both in his Rhetoric and in his\nPoetics, but his remarks were quite brief and largely\nsubordinate to accounts of style. In contrast, Theophrastus composed a\nspecial treatise On Delivery, which is unfortunately lost;\nthere are at least a few texts among our sources that provide us with\ninformation about Theophrastus\u2019 views on delivery, but none of\nthese texts actually refers by title to the treatise On\nDelivery. Still, it is safe to say that in his rhetoric\nTheophrastus attributed primary importance to the pitch of voice as\nwell as to bodily movement (fr. 712 FHS&G). He also emphasized the\neffects of facial expression and, in particular, those resulting from\na fixed gaze or a blank stare (fr. 713 FHS&G). It is worth adding\nthat, by giving importance and independent treatment to the subject of\ndelivery, Theophrastus succeeded in influencing the subsequent\ndevelopment of rhetoric, for delivery came to be recognized as its\nfourth part coordinate with style, invention and arrangement (see\nFortenbaugh 1985b).\n\nLike Aristotle, Theophrastus discussed prose rhythm, too. He drew a\nsharp distinction between verse and rhythm, arguing that verse has no\nplace in prose and suggesting that a colon or a period can be\nrhythmical without having too precise a rhythm. More specifically, he\nshowed a preference for periods in which the final colon is longer\nthan the preceding one (fr. 701 FHS&G), and betrayed a fondness\nfor the paeon, which he considered as most flexible and at the same\ntime most magnificent (frs. 702\u2013704 FHS&G).\n\nTheophrastus seems to have been well known in antiquity as a writer on\nmusic (frs. 715\u2013721B FHS&G), and there are Arabic sources\nthat refer to a tradition of musical theory that was believed to be\ntraceable to him (frs. 722\u2013725 FHS&G). But although his work\non the subject was apparently respected, we know rather little of its\ncontent. Theophrastus\u2019 writings on music\u2014namely, On\nMusic, On the Musicians and Harmonics\u2014are\nlost, and it is only thanks to Porphyry that a single verbatim\nquotation from his treatise On Music is preserved (fr. 716\nFHS&G), in which we find some of Theophrastus\u2019 views (see\nBarker 1985; Sicking 1998).\n\nTheophrastus advocated that all previous musical theories, which tried\nto provide a basis for the analysis of differences of pitch in\nquantitative terms, were to be rejected. That is to say, he argued\nagainst the Pythagoreans, Plato and Aristotle, because they all had\ndefended the view that, since pitches differ in a quantitative manner\nand a melody is a series of different pitches, music itself consists\nin quantities and relations between quantities. Theophrastus claimed\ninstead that differences in pitch are essentially qualitative, but it\nproves very difficult to reconstruct in detail the doctrine about\npitch that he himself suggested in place of the quantitative account.\nHowever, the important question about music, for Theophrastus, seems\nto be the extent to which it is possible to identify in audible pitch\nsequences qualities that are the same as or analogous to qualities of\npsychic states. Plato and Aristotle believed that music has an\nimportant role to play in the process of educating the human soul to\nvirtue, for music is not only pleasant but also expressive of\ncharacter. Theophrastus, on the other hand, limited the role of music\nto a significant degree; in his view, only in the case of children\ndoes music contribute to virtue, while with others it may even\ncontribute to vice (fr. 720 FHS&G). On the other hand, it seems\nthat Theophrastus assigned to music a cathartic effect; according to\nhim, music cures many of the ills that affect the soul and the body,\nsuch as fainting, fright and prolonged disturbances of mind (fr. 726\nFHS&G).\n",
