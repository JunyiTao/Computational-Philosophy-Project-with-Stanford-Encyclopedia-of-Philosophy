    "main_text": "The Moral Considerability of Animals || Speciesism\n1.1 Speciesism\n\nThe view that only humans are morally considered is sometimes referred\nto as \u201cspeciesism\u201d. In the 1970s, Richard Ryder coined\nthis term while campaigning in Oxford to denote a ubiquitous type of human centered prejudice, which he\nthought was similar to racism. He objected to favoring one\u2019s own\nspecies, while exploiting or harming members of other species. Peter\nSinger popularized the term and focused on the way speciesism, without\nmoral justification, favors the interests of humans: \n\n\nthe racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight\nto the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash\nbetween their interests and the interests of those of another race.\nSimilarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to\noverride the greater interests of members of other species. The\npattern is the same in each case. (Singer 1974: 108) \n\n\nDiscrimination based on race, like discrimination based on species is\nthought to be prejudicial, because these are not characteristics that\nmatter when it comes to making moral claims.\n\nSpeciesist actions and attitudes are prejudicial because there is no\nprima facie reason for preferring the interests of beings\nbelonging to the species group to which one also belongs over the\ninterests of those who don\u2019t. That humans are members of the\nspecies Homo sapiens is certainly a distinguishing feature of\nhumans\u2014humans share a genetic make-up and a distinctive\nphysiology, we all emerge from a human pregnancy, but this is\nunimportant from the moral point of view. Species membership is a\nmorally irrelevant characteristic, a bit of luck that is no more\nmorally interesting than being born in Malaysia or Canada. As a\nmorally irrelevant characteristic it cannot serve as the basis for a\nview that holds that our species deserves moral consideration that is\nnot owed to members of other species.\n\nOne might respond that it is not membership in a biological category\nthat matters morally, but rather the social meaning of those\ncategories, meanings that structure not only the institutions we\noperate within, but how we conceptualize ourselves and our world.\nHumans have developed moral systems as well as a wide range of other\nvaluable practices, and by creating these systems, we separate the\nhuman from the rest of the animal kingdom. But the category\n\u201chuman\u201d itself is morally contested. Some argue, for\nexample, that racism is not simply, or even primarily about\ndiscrimination and prejudice, but rather a mechanism of dehumanizing\nblackness so as to provide the conditions that makes humans white (see\nFanon 1967; Kim 2015; Ko& Ko 2017). According\nto this line of thought, speciesism isn\u2019t focused on\ndiscrimination or prejudice but is a central tool for creating human\n(and white) supremacy or exceptionalism.\n",
