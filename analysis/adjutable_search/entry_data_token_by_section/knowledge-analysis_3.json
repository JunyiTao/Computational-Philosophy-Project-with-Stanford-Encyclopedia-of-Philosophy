    "main_text": "Knowledge as Justified True Belief || The Justification Condition\n1.3 The Justification Condition\n\nWhy is condition (iii) necessary? Why not say that knowledge is true\nbelief? The standard answer is that to identify knowledge with true\nbelief would be implausible because a belief might be true even though\nit is formed improperly. Suppose that William flips a coin, and\nconfidently believes\u2014on no particular basis\u2014that it will\nland tails. If by chance the coin does land tails, then\nWilliam\u2019s belief was true; but a lucky guess such as this one is\nno knowledge. For William to know, his belief must in some epistemic\nsense be proper or appropriate: it must be\n justified.[5]\n\nSocrates articulates the need for something like a justification\ncondition in Plato\u2019s Theaetetus, when he points out\nthat \u201ctrue opinion\u201d is in general insufficient for\nknowledge. For example, if a lawyer employs sophistry to induce a jury\ninto a belief that happens to be true, this belief is insufficiently\nwell-grounded to constitute knowledge.\n1.3.1 Approaches to Justification\n\nThere is considerable disagreement among epistemologists concerning\nwhat the relevant sort of justification here consists in.\nInternalists about justification think that whether a belief\nis justified depends wholly on states in some sense internal\nto the subject. According to one common such sense of\n\u201cinternal\u201d, only those features of a subject\u2019s\nexperience which are directly or introspectively available count as\n\u201cinternal\u201d\u2014call this \u201caccess\ninternalism\u201d. According to another, only intrinsic states of the\nsubject are \u201cinternal\u201d\u2014call this \u201cstate\ninternalism\u201d. See Feldman & Conee 2001\nfor the distinction.\n\nConee and Feldman present an example of an internalist view. They have\nit that S\u2019s belief that p is justified if and only\nif believing that p is the attitude towards p that best\nfits S\u2019s evidence, where the latter is understood to\ndepend only on S\u2019s internal mental states. Conee and\nFeldman call their view \u201cevidentialism\u201d, and characterize\nthis as the thesis that justification is wholly a matter of the\nsubject\u2019s evidence. Given their (not unsubstantial) assumption\nthat what evidence a subject has is an internal matter, evidentialism\nimplies\n internalism.[6]\nExternalists about justification think that factors external\nto the subject can be relevant for justification; for example, process\nreliabilists think that justified beliefs are those which are formed\nby a cognitive process which tends to produce a high proportion of\ntrue beliefs relative to false\n ones.[7]\n We shall return to the question of how reliabilist approaches bear on\nthe analysis of knowledge in\n \u00a76.1.\n1.3.2 Kinds of Justification\n\nIt is worth noting that one might distinguish between two importantly\ndifferent notions of justification, standardly referred to as\n\u201cpropositional justification\u201d and \u201cdoxastic\njustification\u201d. (Sometimes \u201cex ante\u201d\njustification and \u201cex post\u201d justification,\n respectively.)[8]\n Unlike that between internalist and externalist approaches to\njustification, the distinction between propositional and doxastic\njustification does not represent a conflict to be resolved; it is a\ndistinction between two distinct properties that are called\n\u201cjustification\u201d. Propositional justification concerns\nwhether a subject has sufficient reason to believe a given\n proposition;[9]\n doxastic justification concerns whether a given belief is held\n appropriately.[10]\n One common way of relating the two is to suggest that propositional\njustification is the more fundamental, and that doxastic justification\nis a matter of a subject\u2019s having a belief that is appropriately\nresponsive to or based on their propositional justification.\n\nThe precise relation between propositional and doxastic justification\nis subject to controversy, but it is uncontroversial that the two\nnotions can come apart. Suppose that Ingrid ignores a great deal of\nexcellent evidence indicating that a given neighborhood is dangerous,\nbut superstitiously comes to believe that the neighborhood is\ndangerous when she sees a black cat crossing the street. Since forming\nbeliefs on the basis of superstition is not an epistemically\nappropriate way of forming beliefs, Ingrid\u2019s belief is not\ndoxastically justified; nevertheless, she does have good\nreason to believe as she does, so she does have propositional\njustification for the proposition that the neighborhood is\ndangerous.\n\nSince knowledge is a particularly successful kind of belief, doxastic\njustification is a stronger candidate for being closely related to\nknowledge; the JTB theory is typically thought to invoke doxastic\njustification (but see Lowy 1978).\n",
