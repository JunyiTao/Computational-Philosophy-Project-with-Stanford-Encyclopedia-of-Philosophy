    "main_text": "What is Cultural Heritage? || What is Heritage?\n1.2 What is Heritage?\n\nAt its core, the concept of \u2018heritage\u2019 is typically taken\nto mean the inheritance of something from the past (in the case of\ncultural heritage, culture; Harrison 2009: 9; Prott &\nO\u2019Keefe 1992: 311). Increasing attention to the range of ways\nthat heritage is employed and interpreted in contemporary contexts has\nled to an emphasis on the use of the past for present purposes as an\nintegral aspect of the definition of heritage itself (Harrison 2013:\n14; Smith 2006: 44; Ashworth, Graham, & Tunbridge 2007: 3).\nRecognition of this facet of heritage has opened up avenues for\ncritique and reinterpretation of the concept of heritage (Lowenthal\n1998). By making manifest how heritage is used for present purposes,\nwe can identify tacit evaluative assumptions that may have gone\nunremarked upon in the past. In particular, scholars have come to\ndistinguish between \u201cofficial\u201d and\n\u201cunofficial\u201d heritage (Harrison 2013: 14\u201315).\n\nThe idea of \u201cofficial heritage\u201d has been shaped in\nparticular by Laurajane Smith\u2019s analysis of what she calls the\nAuthorized Heritage Discourse (Smith 2006). This is the presentation\nof heritage familiar to us from museums, national monuments, and other\ninstitutionally endorsed understandings of heritage, such as the\nUNESCO World Heritage List. \u201cOfficial heritage\u201d is thus\noften used by governments and cultural institutions to cultivate a\nsense of national or cosmopolitan identity around some aspect of the\npast. As Smith summarizes:\n\n\nThis dominant Western discourse stresses materiality, monumentality,\ngrandiosity, time depth, aesthetics and all that is \u2018good\u2019\nin history and culture. (Smith 2010: 63)\n\n\nOfficial heritage on the global scale of UNESCO is typically presented\nas having a universal value that transcends local attachments (Cleere\n1996; Omland 2006; Matthes 2015). According to Smith\u2019s critique,\nthe material focus of official heritage impedes recognition of the\nfact that heritage is best understood as a process of interpretation\nthat is ongoing, in contrast with the pre-digested lists and museum\ndisplays presented by the official line.\n\n\nHeritage\u2026 is a cultural process that engages with acts of\nremembering that work to create ways to understand and engage with the\npresent, and the sites themselves are cultural tools that can\nfacilitate, but are not necessarily vital for, this process. (Smith\n2006: 44)\n\n\nThus, in contrast with the \u201ctop-down\u201d nature of\n\u201cofficial heritage\u201d, \u201cunofficial heritage\u201d is\ncharacterized by the \u201cbottom-up\u201d ways in which individuals\nsort out their relationship to, and uses of, the past, which may be in\ntension with, or at least unrecognized by, official characterizations\nof heritage (Harrison 2009: 8).\n\n\nExamples include local festivals that are not recognised as of\ninterest to the state, or the heritage of migrant groups or the\nworking class. (Harrison 2013: 16)\n\n\nThis critique also draws our attention to \u201cintangible\u201d\nforms of heritage, in contrast with the material focus of the\ntraditional line, discussed further in\n section 2.5.\n\nThough the distinction between official and unofficial heritage is\nuseful both for drawing attention to how heritage is subject to\nconstant reinterpretation and for challenging dominant historical\nnarratives, some might be hesitant about the extent to which certain\nunderstandings of heritage that emphasize process do so at the expense\nof the traditional material concerns of official heritage. For\ninstance, one might think there is something significant\n(aesthetically, ethically, etc.) about the kinds of old material\nvalues that official heritage tends to endorse (e.g., Korsmeyer 2016;\nJames 2013; Saito 2007), even if these values should also be\nchallenged and supplemented from other cultural perspectives.\n\nAs noted above, heritage (and official heritage in particular) tends\nto be associated with positive evaluations of the past (Harrison 2013;\nWeiss 2007), though not universally so (Smith 2017). Indeed,\n\u201cthe word for \u2018heritage\u2019 in many language has an\noverwhelmingly positive public connotation\u201d (Macdonald 2009: 9).\nThis makes the identification of sites of injustice and atrocity as\nheritage a particularly fraught affair (often referred to as negative,\ndifficult, or dissonant heritage) raising questions about how to\nreconcile the positive associations of the heritage concept with sites\nthat people experience as traumatic (Meskell 2002; Macdonald 2009,\n2016; Tunbridge & Ashworth 1996; Sandis 2014a). These tensions can\nbring to the fore competing conceptions of national identity or\nhistorical narrative, especially in the context of regime change or\ncivil war.\n",
