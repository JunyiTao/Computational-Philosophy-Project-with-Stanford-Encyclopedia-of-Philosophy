Most\nnaturalists simply posit their naturalism and work downstream from it,\nhoping that its consequences will prove attractive to the susceptible\n(Maddy 2007, 3). Naturalism thus effectively becomes a personal\ncredo with little direct attempt to bring anyone else on board:\nI accept only X-standards in some domain because I\nfind them more credible than others. Now perhaps at the end of the day one cannot do better. But we shouldn't assume that at the outset. That is\nall the more important given naturalism's revolutionary features,\nas explained earlier. A conservative theory of justification might\nsanction naturalism given a broadly naturalist starting point; but our\nstarting point, as we have seen, is not that of trumping\nnaturalism: it is at most compatibility naturalism. So an argument for\nanything more than the mildest version of naturalism would be\nwelcome.\n",
