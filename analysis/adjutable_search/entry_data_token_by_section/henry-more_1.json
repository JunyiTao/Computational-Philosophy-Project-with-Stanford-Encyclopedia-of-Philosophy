    "main_text": "Cartesianism and Natural Theology\n2. Cartesianism and Natural Theology\n\nMore read Descartes\u2019s Principia philosophiae in 1646,\nand it had a very profound effect upon him and upon the subsequent\ndevelopment of his own philosophy. \u201cAll that have attempted\nanything in naturall Philosophy hitherto are mere shrimps and fumblers\nin comparison of him\u201d, More wrote in 1648 (Letter to Hartlib, 11\nDecember 1648, Webster 1969, 365). Accordingly, he began to teach\nDescartes\u2019s mechanical philosophy to interested students in\nCambridge, and so became one of the earliest conduits for the\ndissemination of Cartesianism in Britain. More is credited with\ninventing the word, Cartesianism, and has been said to be behind the\nstrangely Platonic reading of Descartes\u2019s methodology in the\nanonymous preface to the first English translation of the\nDiscourse of a Method (1649) (Cristofolini 1974). In his\nlater writings, however, More is much more critical of this new\nphilosophy. It used to be assumed that More began as a follower of\nDescartes and became more critical of his philosophy as his own\nphilosophy matured. It is now recognised, however, that More was\nalways critical of certain aspects of Cartesianism, and that the\nincreasingly negative attitude towards Cartesianism reflects a growing\nrealisation that Descartes\u2019s errors (as More saw them) were not\nsimply infelicities, which might be corrected by philosophical\nnegotiation, but were defining characteristics of Cartesianism,\nparticularly as the philosophy was developed by his followers, after\nDescartes\u2019s own untimely death (Gabbey 1982, 1990; Reid 2012,\n2018; Leech 2013).\n\nThere is an interesting contrast here with More\u2019s response to\nVaughan. More was immediately aware that, although he and Vaughan\nmight seem to be fellow-travellers, their philosophies\u2014and their\nunderlying beliefs\u2014were in fact very different. In the case of\nDescartes, however, More seems to have genuinely believed they were\nfellow-travellers, both committed to the establishment of a dualism of\nbody and soul in the service of religion, even though they might seem\nto onlookers to have been very different. More expressed this in 1662\nin the Preface to his Collection of Philosophical\nWritings:\n\nWe both setting out from the same Lists, though taking several ways,\nthe one travelling in the lower rode of Democritism, amidst the thick\ndust of Atoms, and flying particles of Matter, the other tracing\no\u2019er the high and aiery hills of Platonism, in that more thin\nand subtle Region of immateriality, meet together notwithstanding at\nlast (and certainly not without a Providence) at the same Goal, namely\nthe Entrance to the holy Bible, dedicating our joint labours to the\nuse and glory of the Christian Church\u2026 (More 1662, Preface\nGeneral, xii)\n\n\nRight from his first acquaintance with Descartes\u2019s philosophy,\ntherefore, More believed that, like him, Descartes supposed that\nexplanations of physical phenomena in terms of material principles\ncould only take us so far, and beyond that point it was necessary to\nacknowledge the role of incorporeal active principles. In so far as\nDescartes did believe this, for him the boundary demarcating what\ncould be explained in material terms and what could not, was a long\nway beyond where More would want to place it.\n\nMore\u2019s interest in Descartes\u2019s philosophy was so profound\nthat his acquaintance, Samuel Hartlib (c.1600\u20131662), an\nassiduous \u201cintelligencer\u201d who keenly promoted (and\nfacilitated) philosophical correspondence, persuaded More to write to\nDescartes in December 1648. More wrote four letters in all, but only\nreceived replies to the first two before Descartes\u2019s death in\n1650. He received an unfinished third reply from Claude Clerselier in\n1655, while Clerselier was preparing his edition of Descartes\u2019s\nLettres (1657), which prompted More\u2019s Responsio ad\nfragmentum Cartesii. It is clear from these letters that\nMore\u2019s differences with Descartes were (as we might expect)\nconsiderable and more serious than More realised.\n\nMore had some detailed criticisms of Cartesian physics, including his\naccount of refraction, and his vortex theory of celestial motions\n(which, More pointed out, ought to have given rise to celestial\ncylinders, rather than spheres, because the vortexes were held to be\nrotating in a plane around the equators of celestial bodies) (see, for\nexample, More 1662, in Antidote Against Atheism, separately\npaginated, 39; see also the Preface General, xv), but the more\nphilosophical criticisms revealed the most significant differences\nbetween them. More\u2019s belief in an absolute space and time, which\nwas going to play a major role in his subsequent philosophy, was\nforeshadowed here in his critique of the Cartesian concepts. He\nrejected not only Descartes\u2019s distinction between a universe\nwhich is indefinite in extent and one which can be concluded to be\ninfinite, but also Descartes\u2019s definition of body as extension,\nand the concomitant impossibility of void space (Koyr\u00e9 1957,\nGrobet 2010, Agostini 2017). More began to develop here one of his\nmost idiosyncratic beliefs, that everything had to exist in space. For\nDescartes bodies were extended things, but immaterial entities, such\nas God, angels, and souls, were not extended and could not be said to\noccupy space (to do so was a category mistake). For More, by contrast,\nimmaterial entities had to exist in space, and had to be extended.\nWhat did not exist in space, according to More, did not exist at all\n(Koyr\u00e9 1957, Grant 1981, Reid 2012). Another group of\ncriticisms derived from More\u2019s dissatisfaction with\nDescartes\u2019s version of mind-body dualism, including aspects of\nthe union and interaction of body and soul, the denial of souls in\nanimals, and major differences about what can be achieved by matter in\nmotion, and what for More required a more active principle. More\nagreed with Descartes that matter was inert and therefore could only\nbe moved in passive response to an external mover. Where Descartes\nassumed the only such external movers were other moving bodies\n(initially, matter had been put into motion by God at the Creation and\nsubsequently motion was transferred from one body to another in\naccordance with the three laws of nature Descartes had devised), More\ninsisted that bodies could be moved by self-active, self-moving,\nimmaterial entities, such as souls and even God himself (Henry 1986,\n1989; Reid 2012, 2018).\n\nThe Cartesian claim that animals were more splendid versions of\nartificial automata, \u201cwhich move without thought\u201d (Letter\nto More, February 1649; Descartes 1991, 366), for example, was seen by\nMore as providing hostages to atheists. In the scholastic tradition\nthe ability to move oneself was seen as evidence of the presence of a\nsoul, and therefore of life. Descartes, pointing out that clocks and\nother automata are capable of moving themselves, denied this\ntraditional view and held the soul to be responsible only for\nthinking; movement was exclusively a feature of bodies. In the\nCartesian system, consequently, plants and animals were living\ncreatures without souls. Evidently, More regarded this position as\nlikely to lead to the conclusion that humans could also be counted as\nliving creatures without souls (it is not clear whether there were\ncontemporary Cartesians who held this, but it certainly became at\nleast a minority view in the period of the Enlightenment) (Cohen 1936,\nHenry 1989, Thomson 2008, Muratori 2017, Reid 2018).\n\nAnxious to defend the concept of immaterial souls from all atheist\nthreats, More insisted that the soul was necessary for life. He was\ntherefore opposed not only to Descartes, but also to traditional\nscholastic views. The motions of plants and animals (plants being\ncapable of internal motions associated with nutrition, reproduction,\nand growth), according to scholastics, proved the existence only of\nvegetative and animal souls respectively. Both of these kinds of souls\nwere regarded as material, however, being composed of subtle fluids or\ntenuous but nonetheless material spirits in the body. Descartes simply\nabsorbed the functions of these material souls into his mechanistic\ntheory of creature-as-automaton. By contrast, More, pursuing his\noverriding concern to deny atheists any footholds, ran counter to both\nAristotelians and Cartesians and insisted on the immateriality of\nanimal souls (and presumably vegetative souls, though he does not seem\nto discuss them). In More\u2019s version of dualism only immaterial\nentities are self-active and capable of initiating movement in other\nentities, and so the fact that plants and animals can move themselves\nis taken to prove that they must have immaterial souls (Henry 1986,\n1989; Reid 2012). It should be noted, therefore, that underlying\nMore\u2019s argumentation is a commitment to the belief that matter\nis essentially passive (capable only of inertial motions), and that\nonly immaterial entities are active. This commitment, however, is not\nbased on any original philosophical arguments developed by More\nhimself. It is simply based on what More sees as a fundamental premise\nof Cartesianism, namely, that matter or body is completely inert and\npassive. This is why More seized upon Cartesianism so keenly. If\nmatter is inert then the activity we see all around us must have\nanother source, which must be immaterial. Underlying this, of course,\nwas a desire to deny the claims of contemporary materialist (and\ntherefore atheist) philosophers (Henry 1986, Leech 2013). \n\nMore also took issue with Descartes\u2019s account of colliding\nbodies. In Descartes\u2019s system the amount of motion was always\nmaintained at a constant level (guaranteed by God) and this was made\nmanifest in collisions, where motions could be seen to be transferred\nfrom one body to another. For More, this seemed too materialistic an\nexplanation, and failed to pay due attention to the role of\nimmateriality. The nub of the matter was that, as More saw it, matter\nin motion was allowed to explain too much by Descartes. The system\ncould be (as indeed it was) appropriated by atheists, who would simply\ndismiss God\u2019s role and turn it into an entirely materialist\nphilosophy. Early in his career, More accepted the basic principles of\nDescartes\u2019s mechanical philosophy, and accepted that\n\u201cMatter it self, once moved, can move other Matter\u201d (More\n1662, in Immortality of the Soul, separately paginated, 21).\nAt this time, More\u2019s immaterial principle of activity, the\nSpirit of Nature (discussed more fully below), was only introduced to\nexplain phenomena which More believed could not be explained\nmechanically, such as gravity (More 1662, in Immortality of the\nSoul, separately paginated, 11). In More\u2019s mature natural\nphilosophy, however, matter was going to be held to be not merely\npassive but absolutely inert. That is to say, where once More would\nhave accepted that passive matter might be held to carry on moving\nafter being given an initial push (indeed it must do so because it\ncould not stop itself), More later developed the view that matter was\ncompletely incapable of moving by itself. Consequently, all activity\nin any system (even what might otherwise look like merely passive\ninertial motion) was to be introduced by, or was the result of, the\nworking of immaterial spirit, because immaterial entities were the\nonly entities capable of acting. In the Preface to his Divine\nDialogues (1668), for example, More insisted \u201cthat there is\nno purely Mechanicall Phaenomenon in the whole Universe\u201d (More\n1668, sig. A6v). By this time, More did not want anything to\nblur the distinction between non-active matter and active spirit, and\nso he could not allow that matter might be set in motion and continue\nto move of its own accord, or by its own nature; this looked too much\nlike matter having activity of its own.\n\nAnother striking indication of the development of More\u2019s\nthinking on this issue can be seen by comparing his early vitalistic\nconcept of matter to his later insistence that matter is completely\ninert. In his early philosophical poems and in his correspondence with\nDescartes, More evidently felt he could dismiss mechanistic\nmaterialism by indicating that even supposedly inanimate bodies were\nalive in some way (Reid 2012, 2018). We can see this, for example, in\nhis objection to Descartes\u2019s claim that motion could be\ntransferred from one moving body to another:\n\nI feel more disposed to believe that motion is not communicated, but\nthat from the impulse of one body another body is so to speak roused\ninto motion, like the mind to a thought on this or that occasion, and\nthat body does not take as much motion as it needs for movement, being\nreminded of the matter by the other body. And as I said a short while\nago, motion bears the same relation to a body as a thought does to the\nmind: neither is received into the subject, in fact, but both arise\nfrom the subject in which they are found. And everything that is\ncalled body I hold to be alive in a sottish and drunken way\u2026\n(More, letter to Descartes, 23 July 1649, Descartes 1966, V: 383).\n\n\nEvidently, More saw this as sufficient to refute atheistic\nmaterialism, declaring in the same letter that although a body can\nneither feel nor think, \u201cit constitutes the last and faintest\nshadow and image of the divine essence, which I take to be the most\nperfect life\u201d (Descartes 1966, V: 383). It soon became apparent\nto More, however, that the shortcomings of the mechanical philosophy\nmight be avoided simply by supposing that matter was alive and\ntherefore capable of self-movement. This might be assumed without\nrecourse to God, and would lead to what More called hylozoic atheism\n(Reid 2018). More quickly dropped all traces of vitalism from his\nconcept of body, therefore, and insisted ever afterwards on the strict\ndichotomy between inactive matter, and active immaterial spirit.\nSubsequently, when he discerned hylozoism in later thinkers, such as\nSpinoza and Francis Glisson (about which more later), he opposed them\nas vigorously as he did mechanistic materialists, such as Thomas\nHobbes and the Cartesians (Henry 1987, Sytsma 2017). It is important\nto note, therefore, that there are clear signs of development in\nMore\u2019s works, from vaguely formed starting points to more\ncarefully wrought and internally consistent mature positions (Reid\n2003, 2007). \n\nBe that as it may, Descartes\u2019s initial response to More\u2019s\naccount of what happens in collisions between bodies (end of August\n1649), which he never managed to send before his death, was that More\nwas inventing principles which were surplus to requirements, and\ntherefore detrimental to philosophy:\n\nI will say here once and for all that nothing diverts us more from\ndiscovering the truth than when we declare to be true something of\nwhich we are persuaded for no positive reason, but only by our will.\nThat is, when we have fancied or invented something, and then\nafterwards our fabrication pleases us, as in your case, with corporeal\nAngels, the shadow of the divine essence, and such like, none of which\nought to be adopted by anyone, because this is the very thing that\nbars us from the road to truth (quoted from Gabbey 1982, 212).\n\n\nThis was an extremely perceptive comment. More was going to go on to\ndevelop his concept of the Spirit of Nature (alluded to here as\n\u201cthe shadow of the divine essence\u201d, but which More later\nreferred to as \u201cthe vicarious power of God\u201d) which would\ndraw similar criticisms from the leading natural philosophers, Robert\nBoyle (1627\u20131691) and Robert Hooke (1635\u20131703). For them\nit was merely a fabrication which explained nothing that could not be\nexplained more simply without it; and \u201cTruth\u201d, as Boyle\nwas later to say (1672), \u201cought to be pleaded for only by\nTruth\u201d (Boyle 1999, 184; Henry 1990). Descartes called\nMore\u2019s Angels \u201ccorporeal\u201d simply because More\ndeclared them to be extended entities. More did not see\nDescartes\u2019s comment until 1655, by which time it was too late.\nBy then, More was already committed to his Spirit of Nature, which he\nsaw as an indispensable feature of the world system (enabling him, for\nexample, to move away from his earlier vitalist materialism, which he\nnow saw as dangerous to religion). It is doubtful, however, that More\nwould have been diverted from this course by Descartes\u2019s words,\neven if he had seen them in time. The Spirit of Nature was not just\npleasing to More; he made it an indispensable feature of his\nphilosophical theology (see next section, and Reid 2012, Leech\n2013).\n\nOne of More\u2019s students at Cambridge, who was clearly impressed\nby his account of Cartesianism, was John Finch (1626\u20131682), son\nof Heneage Finch (1580\u20131631), Speaker of the House of Commons.\nFinch introduced More to his half-sister, Anne, who later became\nVicountess Conway and Killultagh (1631\u20131679). Anne had a passion\nfor learning and More tutored her in philosophy, and particularly in\nCartesianism, but their relationship soon developed into one of\nfriendship. Although they remained friends to the last, the\nrelationship of tutor and pupil eventually gave way to one of equals,\nand Anne developed sufficiently to produce a philosophical theology\nthat was very much her own, and was effectively a rejection of\nMore\u2019s (Nicolson 1992, Conway 1996, Hutton 2004). The Cambridge\nPlatonist did not just benefit from the delights of Anne\u2019s\ncompany, however; the Conway family was to prove a powerful patron and\nsupporter for More after the Restoration, when his former allegiance\nto the Protectorate drew potentially dangerous criticism. Indeed,\nEdward, Lord Conway (c. 1623\u20131683) even arranged a\nbishopric in Ireland for More, and an appointment as prebend of\nWorcester, but More preferred to remain in Cambridge.\n\nIt was during the Protectorate that More produced a remarkable group\nof philosophical writings. There is a sense in which the four works\nwhich he published throughout the 1650s can be seen as a summation of\nMore\u2019s philosophical system. This is perhaps evident from the\nfact that, shortly after the appearance of the last of them, The\nImmortality of the Soul of 1659, he re-issued them all together\nin his Collection of Philosophical Writings (1662). The\nessentially pragmatic aim of More\u2019s philosophy was made plain in\nthe title of the first of these, An Antidote Against Atheism\n(1653)\u2014the collection as a whole might well have been called an\nantidote against contemporary threats to religion: atheism, and\nenthusiasm.\n\nThe Antidote deserves to be better known as one of the\nearliest contributions to what later became a vigorous tradition in\nBritish natural philosophy, namely natural theology. Although there is\na sense in which natural theology, or the attempt to establish the\nexistence and attributes of God by studying nature, can be found among\nThomas Aquinas\u2019s five proofs of the existence of God, it was\nonly in the seventeenth century that this enterprise began to be\nworked out in detail, usually alongside the promotion of the new\natomistic philosophies which seemed to offer the best alternative to\nthe traditional \u201chand-maiden\u201d to Christian theology,\nAristotelianism. The very first contributions to natural theology,\npublished long before the tradition\u2019s Newtonian heyday, were\nWalter Charleton\u2019s Darknes of Atheism dispelled by the Light\nof Nature (1652), and More\u2019s Antidote (Leech\n2013). More even prefigured the much later argument of William Paley\nthat depended upon finding a watch in an uninhabited place: \n\nif so brief a treatise as that of Archimedes de Sphaera et\nCylindro had been found by chance, with the delineations of all\nthe figures suitable for the design... could you or anyone else\nimagine that the delineating and fitting these things together was by\nchance, and not from a knowing and designing principle, I mean from a\npower intellectual? (More 1668, 20\u201321)\n\n\nThe Antidote begins by borrowing Descartes\u2019s\nontological proof of the existence of God, but he went on from there\nto consider other aspects of the fact that we have an\n\u201cindelible\u201d idea of God and, as Descartes showed, other\ninnate ideas. This led him to consider, for example, the final cause\nof our idea of God, which in turn led him to consider our innate\nknowledge of good and evil. The first book is also concerned with the\nnature of the soul itself, in which More takes pains to persuade his\nreader that it is distinct from the substance of the body, and that\nthe body is completely incapable not only of thought, without the\nincorporeal soul, but also of movement. The second book develops the\nargument from design to oppose atheism, and the third introduces a\nfavourite stratagem of More\u2019s, the rehearsal of well-known or\nwell-attested stories of witchcraft, snake-charming, raising of\ntempests by the power of words, and other \u201cspiritual\u201d\nphenomena as evidence for the existence of an immaterial realm\n(Coudert 1990, Crocker 2003). Throughout More builds up a picture of\nimmaterial spirit as the only substance capable of spontaneous\nactivity, and insists that inert matter is incapable of explaining all\nphysical phenomena on its own.\n\nMore\u2019s next work, the Conjectura Cabbalistica: Or, A\nconjectural Essay of interpreting the minde of Moses according to a\nthreefold Cabbala, viz., literal, philosophical, mystical, or divinely\nmoral, published in the same year as the Antidote, is a\nstrange exercise, supposedly based on the premise that the first three\nchapters of Genesis contain a summation of all wisdom but hidden under\na veil. It can be seen as an attempt not just to link natural\nphilosophy with religion (which could result in a merely deistic\nnatural theology), but to link it with revealed religion, as\ntaught in Scripture. Written at the request of Anne Conway, it is an\nexercise in imaginative scholarship, seeking to show, for example,\nthat ancient Pythagoreanism, which gave rise to Platonism, was in fact\nderived from an earlier Mosaical philosophy, and can now be seen,\nthanks to More, as tantamount to Cartesianism:\n\nThe Cartesian Philosophy being in a manner the same with that of\nDemocritus; and that of Democritus the same with the Physiological\npart of Pythagoras his Philosophy; and Pythagoras his Philosophy, the\nsame with the Sidonian, as also the Sidonian, with the Mosaical; it\nwill necessarily follow, that the Mosaical Philosophy in the\nPhysiological part thereof is the same with the Cartesian. And how\nfitly the Cartesian Philosophy suits with Moses his Text, I have again\nand again taken notice (More 1712, 114; see also Crocker 2003, 70).\n\n\nOne of the ways in which More tries to establish the link between\nCartesianism and the teachings of Moses is by arguing for a close\nparallel between the three types of matter, or three elements,\ndiscerned by Descartes, and the three successively rarefied\n\u201cvehicles\u201d of the soul in Platonised versions of Christian\ndoctrine, the terrestrial, the aerial, and the aetherial. It is\nperhaps worth pointing out that this work owes little or nothing to\nthe Jewish tradition of Kabbalah, but should be seen as a late\ncontribution to the Renaissance tradition of Christian cabbala first\nintroduced by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463\u20131494) (Coudert\n1992, Crocker 2003; but see below, and Laerke 2017, for developments\nlater in More\u2019s career).\n\nHaving directly attacked atheism, and shown the close relationship\nbetween the Bible and the latest philosophical ideas, More then turned\nhis attention to what was widely perceived as the other contemporary\nthreat to sound religion, enthusiasm. The Enthusiasmus\nTriumphatus of 1656 is concerned with the different kinds of\nreligious fanaticism, their causes, and how to cure them. Among the\nspecific writers singled out by More are the founders of the so-called\nFamily of Love, David George (fl. 1550?), and Henry Nicholas\n(c. 1501\u2013 c. 1580), the alchemist and\n\u201cLuther of medicine\u201d, Paracelsus (1493\u20131541), and\nthe German mystic, Jacob Boehme (1575\u20131624). The cure prescribed\nby Dr More required temperance, humility, and reason. Here again,\nhowever, we can see More\u2019s overriding concern with a failure to\ndistinguish between matter and spirit:\n\nOur exorbitant Enthusiasts professe that everything is God in love and\nwrath: Which if I understand anything is no better then Atheisme. For\nit implies that God is nothing else but the Universall Matter of the\nWorld, dressed up in severall shapes and forms, in sundry properties\nand qualities\u2026 But to slice God into so many parts is to wound\nhim and kill him, and to make no God at all (More 1656, 48).\n\n\nThe final book in this series, and for the time being the culmination\nof More\u2019s philosophical ambitions, was the Immortality of\nthe Soul, So farre forth as it is demonstrable from the Knowledge of\nNature and the Light of Reason (1659). As is evident from the\ntitle, the book marks a return to natural theology, but it also\nreturns to other earlier themes, including the parallel between\nCartesian matter theory and the three \u201cvehicles\u201d of the\nsoul, and the reality of spiritual phenomena as revealed in accounts\nof witchcraft, apparitions, and the like. A major new focus of concern\nis the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, whose Leviathan had\nappeared in 1651. More decries Hobbes for his materialism, his\ndeterminism, and his mortalism (emphasising the resurrection of the\nbody on a far distant Day of Judgment, with no interim post\nmortem punishment, or reward), all of which, of course, are seen\nby More as incompatible with Christian theism.\n\nPerhaps as a result of the perceived atheism of Hobbes, and\nMore\u2019s increasing awareness that the philosophy of Descartes had\nalso been appropriated by atheists and twisted to serve their\npurposes, More presents his own would-be cure for atheism in its most\ncogent and most powerful form in The Immortality of the Soul.\nThe main focus of the three books are the establishment of dualism and\nthe nature of incorporeal substance, the relationship of the soul to\nthe body, and the life of the separated soul in the after-life; but\nalong the way More deals with many associated phenomena, such as the\nsouls of animals, and the pre-existence of the human soul. In\nparticular, it is in this work that he develops most fully his concept\nof the Spirit of Nature. Although the Spirit of Nature is More\u2019s\nmost characteristic contribution to the history of natural philosophy,\nhis pronouncements about it have only very recently been properly\nexamined (Henry 1990, Reid 2012, Leech 2013). It is not hard to see\nwhy this is so. The concept was vigorously opposed by contemporary\nnatural philosophers, from leading figures such as Boyle and Hooke,\ndown to a dilettante virtuoso such as Sir Matthew Hale\n(1609\u20131676). The concept had very little influence, therefore,\nbeyond More\u2019s own circle of devoted followers. The only other\nphilosopher to take it seriously was More\u2019s close friend and\ncolleague, the Master of Christ\u2019s College, Ralph Cudworth\n(1617\u20131688). Since our immediate concern here is the philosophy\nof Henry More, irrespective of its influence, we must look closely at\nhis most distinctive contribution to natural philosophy.\n",
