It is as though being were divided between the being of\na created world and the darkness out of which light was\n brought.[11]\n This shifts phenomenological focus onto being as light and\nvisibility, in which we constitute objects, and being as the dark\nturmoil that we experience in insomnia. Levinas\u2019 attempt to\nexpand the sense of the embodied Da-sein, and reconsider the\ndistinction between being and Da-sein (existence and the\nperceptual open that we are) has also changed. Following\nHusserl\u2019s transcendental phenomenology, in which a multi-layered\n\u201cI\u201d directs intentional focus like a center from which our\nattention radiates, Levinas\u2019 embodied ego is neither preceded\nnor outstripped by its world. The corporeal self [soi],\nhenceforth called the \u201chypostasis\u201d, is its own ground;\ni.e., we awaken out of ourselves, into light; we proceed with our\nprojects (EE: 61\u201386; TO: 51\u201355). We fall asleep, curled\nabout ourselves, thereby exiting our conscious existence. Embodied\nconsciousness thus begins and ends with itself. As such, it is both\ndependent on and independent from its environment, and Levinas will\nurge that the subject, upon awakening, uses and masters being.\n\nIn the middle period essays, the partial transcendences of pleasure\nand desire, already sketched in 1935, receive fuller development and\nvariations. The meaning of transcendence focuses on a new temporality\npromised by desire and \u201cfecundity\u201d, or the birth of the\nson (EE: 100; TO: 91\u201392). The son incarnates alterity in a\ncurious way. He is, in a sense, his father and not his\nfather. However, his birth opens a focus on the future. No longer\nconceived as one of open possibilities, as Heidegger had argued, the\ntime opened by the son responds to two basic limitations on our\nunderstanding and representation: death and the other person. While\nnot denying Heidegger\u2019s intuition about death as the\n\u201cpossibility of impossibility\u201d, Levinas repeats his\nearlier argument that we witness death only in the death of the other.\nBut even as such it escapes everyday understanding. Hence Levinas will\nqualify death as an alterity as radical as that of the other human\nbeing who confronts me. \n\n\nIn death the existing of the existent is alienated. To be sure, the\nother that is announced does not possess this existing as the subject\npossesses it; its hold over my existing is mysterious. It is not\nunknown but unknowable. (TO: 75) \n\n\nOf course, we can and do constitute the other an alter ego.\nYet such constitution by phenomenological analogy never exhausts his\nfundamental difference (TO: 78\u201379). In so arguing, Levinas\nproposes to radicalize Husserl\u2019s \u201cother\u201d, of whom\nthe latter said that he or she is \u201can analogon of\nmyself, [yet also] not an analogon in the habitual\nsense\u201d (hu-CM \u00a744: 92-96).\n\nTwo reversals should be noted, here, relative to 1935. First, against\nHegel\u2019s conception of work as the dialectic of spirit\ntransforming nature, Levinas describes labor phenomenologically as\neffort and\n fatigue,[12]\n again highlighting his distinction between the embodied, working self\nand the cognitive ego. The second reversal concerns moods themselves.\nIn Heidegger, anxiety, joy, and boredom were states of mind, with\nanxiety as the privileged mood by which humans are confronted with\nthemselves, their lack of ground, and with the question of their\nexistence. In his middle period, Levinas will expand the experience of\nbeing to moods now including horror. Nighttime being reveals an\nindeterminate dark presence that is not pure nothing. \u201cThe\nhorror of the night, as an experience of the there-is, does not then\nreveal to us a danger of death, nor even a danger of pain\u201d (EE:\n57). Therefore pure being can never be just Heidegger\u2019s lighted\nclearing. And our existence in the world requires stronger embodiment\nthan an eye and a hand that reaches to grasp objects\n\u201cready-to-hand\u201d (Heidegger). Once again, Levinas recurs to\nbodily states, this time including fatigue, indolence, insomnia, and\nawakening. In the first three, the aforementioned gap between the\nembodied self and the intentional I increases. Upon awakening, the\nembodied ego (soi-moi) reasserts its mastery over things and\neven its own bodily torpor. But for Levinas being in the world is less\na matter of utility and Heidegger\u2019s phenomenon of\n\u201cfalling\u201d into distraction, than one of love of life and\nsheer enjoyment (he-BT:\n 179).[13]\n This, too, is part of Levinas\u2019 critique of Heidegger, for whom\nour concern for the world often coexists with instrumentalist\nrelationships with things. In search of variations on being as a call\nor a revelation, and in privileging the basic subjectivity (or\n\u201chypostasis\u201d) capable of raising itself above being (now\nunderstood as the neutral \u201cthere is\u201d), Levinas is en\nroute to his secular philosophy of alterity and\ntranscendence.\n\nIt bears recalling that, in phenomenology, light plays figurative and\nliteral roles, from Husserl\u2019s daylight as the condition for\noptimal perception (Ideas II \u00a718) to his metaphor for the\nintentional \u201cray\u201d directed like a spotlight upon an\nobject, to Heidegger\u2019s lighted opening that is Da-sein\nitself (he-BT: 171). Levinas in turn underscores the\n\u2018work\u2019 of light as able to suspend, phenomenologically,\nthe traditional distinction between subjective and objective:\n\u201cdue to the light an object, while coming from without, is\nalready ours in the horizon which precedes it\u201d (EE: 41).\nConsequently, intelligibility is well figured by light.\nPhenomenological evidence is guaranteed by lighted\ncircumstances\u2014albeit for someone. Whereas Heidegger\ndefined Da-sein almost operationally (\u201cby its very\nnature, Dasein brings its \u2018there\u2019 along with\nit\u201d [he-BT: 171]), Levinas returns to the Moderns\u2019\nprinciple \u201cevery object presupposes a subject\u201d.\nMoreover, while the being of Da-sein is itself light and\n\u201cdisclosedness\u201d (he-BT: 171), the being of Levinas\u2019\nhypostasis is characterized by its living cycle of drowsing, sleeping,\nwaking, and acting. Thus, if being is equated with illumination, for\nLevinas it must also include the dark anonymity of night (EE: 54). It\nis both gift (Heidegger\u2019s es gibt) and \u201cthere\nis\u201d (Blanchot\u2019s il y a, as taken up by Levinas).\nConsequently, the question that inaugurates fundamental ontology: Why\nis there being instead of simply nothing? is not Levinas\u2019\nprimary concern. Nothingness, understood as pure absence, may be\nthinkable, but it cannot be experienced. Indeterminate, nocturnal\nbeing remains \u2018something\u2019. As the \u201cthere is\u201d,\nbeing fills in all spatial and temporal intervals, whereas\nconsciousness arises out of it thanks to its self-originating\nawakening and focus. This is Levinas\u2019 first\ncomprehensive sketch of being as a totality, in which the\nself-ego dyad appears as the limited transcendence of neutral being.\nOver the course of his analyses, this self-ego will hearken to a call.\nHowever, the call comes not from being but from an alterity that\nLevinas compares with death itself. \u201cJust as with death, I am\nnot concerned with an existent, but with the event of\nalterity\u201d (TO: 87, emph. added). With \u201cthe event of\nalterity\u201d, however, there is the call of the other person,\nnotably female, experienced as desire, need, even\n generosity.[14]\n These works set the stage for later descriptions of world, facticity,\ntime as now-moment, transcendence in immanence, and transcendence\ntoward a future fecundity in the family. They constitute the core of\nLevinas\u2019 first major work, Totality and Infinity: An Essay\non Exteriority. \n",
