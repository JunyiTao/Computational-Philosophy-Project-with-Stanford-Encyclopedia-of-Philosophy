    "main_text": "The Allocation of Organs || Self-inflicted illness and social value\n3.2 Self-inflicted illness and social value\n\nTwo other specific allocation questions are:\n\nShould people who have caused themselves to be in need of a\ntransplant by leading a \u201chigh risk\u201d life be assigned lower\npriority?\nShould people who are more \u201csocially valuable\u201d be\nassigned higher priority?\n\n\nSome people increase their chances of needing a transplant organ by\nleading what they know to be unhealthy lifestyles. Many of those who\nsmoke, or drink alcohol excessively, or eat too much know that they\nare acting unhealthily (whether or not they know that smoking\nincreases the risks of heart and lung failure, that drinking increases\nthe risk of liver failure, and that obesity increases the risk of\nkidney and pancreas failure). It has been suggested that such people\nforfeit or weaken their claims to medical treatment (Brown 2013; Buyx\n2008; Smart 1994; Walker 2010).\n\nThere is one \u201cnon-ethical\u201d argument for this view, called\nthe Medical Argument. According to this:\n\n\n\u2026 patients with self-inflicted illness \u2026 should have\nlower priority in access to health care because they are more likely\nto experience poor medical outcomes. (Sharkley and Gillam 2010:\n661)\n\n\nOn the factual premise, it seems false that as a class those with\n\u201cself-inflicted\u201d illness would do so badly they should be\ndeprioritized (Munson 2002), although transplant systems often do try\nto screen out those who would continue to act in ways that jeopardize\ntheir new organs. In any case, the Medical Argument is essentially\njust an application of more general cost-effectiveness criteria and\nnot something that requires a special ethical justification. The\narguments considered below, in contrast, are ones which claim that\n(for example) heavy drinkers and smokers should have lower priority\naccess to organs even if they are no more likely than others\nto experience poor transplant outcomes. There are three main ethical\narguments for this claim, two of which are clearly quite weak; a\nthird, the Restoration Argument, is worth taking more seriously.\n\nThe first argument concerns incentives. It says that if (for\nexample) we refuse to provide heavy drinkers with liver transplants\nthen this will discourage irresponsible drinking. Similar things are\nsaid about overeating and obesity.\n\nThe argument however is problematic. To continue with alcohol, would\norgan allocation policy really make much difference to people\u2019s\ndrinking-behavior? Some reasons for thinking not include:\n\nThe very long-term nature of the calculation that drinkers would\nbe required to make. They would need to gamble on organ allocation\npolicies staying as they are for perhaps many decades and would need\nto trade off highly speculative longer-term gains (maybe needing and\nthen getting an organ many years down the line) against short-term\npleasure and reward (having another drink now).\nSerious liver disease ought to be incentive enough. If the\nprospect of serious organ failure is not acting as an incentive then\nwhat are the chances of allocation policy doing so?\nMany heavy drinkers are dependent on alcohol and so incentives may\nnot engage them effectively. Similar things might be said about\nsmoking, illegal drug use, and even diet (Walker 2010).\n\n\nAnother challenge for the incentives approach is that if the rationale\nfor deprioritising heavy drinkers, say, is simply incentivisation then\nthere is no reason to restrict these measures to cases of organ\nfailure. Why not instead remove their driving licenses, or their\naccess to non-urgent healthcare, or subject them to punitive rates of\ntax? Such measures could all be incentives to stop drinking\nand would surely be more effective\u2014not least because their\neffects would be felt straightaway, rather than many years down the\nline.\n\nThe next argument suggests that heavy drinkers and smokers should be\ndeprioritised on transplant waiting lists as a punishment for\nwrongdoing. There are several reasons to reject such a position:\n\nUnhealthy behavior such as excessive drinking, overeating, and\nsmoking may well not be morally wrong nor merit punishment.\nIf punishing wrongdoing is the purpose of the allocation exercise\nthen there are probably more deserving candidates for punishment than\nthose who overindulge (even if there is something morally\nwrong with such overindulgence).\nUsing healthcare resource allocation as a mode of punishment is\nimpracticable and unfair, and may have adverse consequences (such as\nnegative effects on public attitudes to organ donation and to\ndoctors). Selecting only certain risky behavior as immoral seems\narbitrary. Waiving that problem, how are judgments about causal and\nmoral responsibility to be made in a timely and cost-effective way,\nand how are doctors going to make them? Punishment should only be\nmeted out by state bodies (i) for prohibited acts (so not, in most\ncountries, drinking, overeating, and smoking) and (ii) following\n\u201cdue process\u201d in a court (Harris 1985).\n\n\nA version of objection (c) applies to an opposite policy proposal:\nthat higher priority should be given to patients with\nhigh social value. This \u201csocial value\u201d could\neither be instrumental (doctors, nurses, parents of young children\nperhaps) or moral (prioritising the virtuous). The fundamental\nobjection to rewarding social value is that it infringes a principle\nof equal treatment but, putting that aside, it has the practical and\nfairness problems of the punishment proposal. How is social value to\nbe determined and then how is it to be applied in a timely and\ncost-effective manner? And, given the potentially dire consequences of\nbeing assigned low social value (which could in practice be a\n\u201cdeath sentence\u201d), procedurally it seems reasonable to\nexpect something akin to a court hearing. A version of allocating\naccording to perceived social value (among other criteria) was tried\nin Seattle in the 1960s in allocating very scarce dialysis (Alexander\n1962). The result seems to have removed any enthusiasm among\ntransplant systems for trying it again.\n\nPerhaps one exception to this is giving higher priority to frontline\nhealthcare workers in situations where such workers are themselves a\nscarce resource, and where therefore there would be fewer transplants\noverall if sick healthcare workers were not prioritised. The\njustification here is that whereas many other \u201csocial\nvalue\u201d based allocation decisions are zero-sum games,\nprioritising healthcare workers could instead increase the total\nnumber of available transplants. This argument has some merit but is\nnot fundamentally so much about social value per se as about\nthe pragmatics of maximising lives saved. Thus, social value\nnotwithstanding, if the healthcare labor market was oversupplied and\ndoctors and nurses could easily be replaced then this pragmatic\nargument would not apply. Conversely, this pragmatic argument could\napply to any shortage profession: e.g. in a situation where,\nbecause of a shortage of Human Resources consultants in the health\nsector, fewer operations are taking place than would otherwise be the\ncase.\n\nThe most promising argument in favor of deprioritising those with\n\u201cunhealthy\u201d lifestyles is the Restoration Argument, which\ngoes as follows (Harris 1985; Smart 1994; S. Wilkinson 1999).\n\nSome people (risk-takers) knowingly and voluntarily have\nunhealthy and/or dangerous lifestyles.\nRisk-takers are more likely to need transplant organs\nthan the general population (non-risk-takers).\nTransplant organs are in short supply.\nBecause of (2) and (3), if we allocate on the basis of clinical\nneed or clinical outcomes alone, non-risk-takers will be\nharmed by the risk-takers\u2019 lifestyle choices;\nthe non-risk-takers\u2019 chances of getting a transplant\norgan will be lower because of the risk-takers\u2019\nincreased demands on the system.\nTo allow the non-risk-takers to be harmed by the\nrisk-takers would be unfair. Why should\nnon-risk-takers have to pay the price for\nrisk-takers\u2019 lifestyle choices?\nIn order to avoid this unfairness, risk-takers\u2019\nentitlements should be reduced such that there is no harm to the\nnon-risk-takers.\n\n\nOne of the most attractive features of this argument is that it\ngrounds the deprioritisation of those with unhealthy lifestyles not in\nvalue judgments about their lifestyles, but rather in a more neutral\nset of concerns about preventing harm to innocent third parties. Thus\nthis argument could apply regardless of whether the risk-taking\nbehavior in question is virtuous or vicious.\n\nEven this argument faces difficulties though. One is that risk-taking\nmay not generate additional healthcare costs or demand for organs.\nIndeed, some kinds of risk-taking behavior (motor sports perhaps)\ncould even increase the supply of high-quality cadaveric organs\navailable for transplant.\n\nS. Wilkinson (1999) takes this fact as a point of departure for a\ndeeper critique of the Restoration Argument. He claims that, if it\nturned out (as is possible in many European countries) that smokers\ncost the state less than non-smokers overall (because on\naverage they die younger, and hence consume fewer health and social\ncare resources in retirement) then proponents of the Restoration\nArgument would be committed to the unpalatable conclusion that smokers\nshould be given not lower but higher priority than other\npatients. Otherwise smokers would be harmed by the non-smokers\u2019\ndeliberate attempts to extend their own lives by avoiding smoking. His\nargument is about financial resources but similar considerations would\napply to organs in relevantly similar situations of scarcity.\n\nWilkinson concludes that this objection seriously weakens the\nRestoration Argument. Either it is simply a reductio ad\nabsurdum of the Restoration Argument, in which case the argument\nmust be rejected wholesale. Or at least its defenders will need to\nappeal to something else, such as moral or social value, in order to\navoid the argument\u2019s unacceptable consequences\u2014thus making\nit vulnerable to some of the problems with appealing to social value\nnoted above (Walker 2010; S. Wilkinson 1999).\n\nAnother wider issue with all of the arguments in this section is that\nassigning responsibility for patterns of action and saying what\nresponsibility amounts to in such cases will be complex, often\ninvolving the interaction of multiple agents and multiple\nenvironmental, genetic, and social factors (Brown & Savulescu\n2019). Therefore, at least in practice, ascertaining for which health\nstates an individual is sufficiently responsible will be too difficult\nand multi-faceted for use in allocation decisions.\n",
