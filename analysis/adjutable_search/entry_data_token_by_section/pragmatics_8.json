    "main_text": "Contemporary Pragmatic Theory || A Methodological Flaw of Linguistic Pragmatism?\n3.5 A Methodological Flaw of Linguistic Pragmatism?\n\nRecently, the philosopher Michael Devitt (2013) raised an interesting\nissue about an alleged methodological flaw of many, if not most,\napproaches to pragmatics. The flaw consists in conflating the\nmetaphysics of meaning \u2014 the study of what constitutes\nthe meaning of an utterance \u2014 and the epistemology of meaning\n\u2014 the study of how the hearer interprets the meaning of\nan utterance. In his words:\n\nConsider the \u2018meaning-properties\u2019 of an utterance in as\nbroad a sense as you like, cover all its \u2018semantic\u2019 and\n\u2018pragmatic\u2019 properties, in whatever preferred sense. So\nthe properties we are concerned with include conventional properties,\n\u2018what is said\u2019, \u2018what is implicated\u2019, and so\non. [footnote omitted] Now, what constitutes one of those properties\nis one thing, how the hearer discovers the property, another. The\nproperty is constituted by what the speaker does, by the conventions\nshe participates in, the objects she has in mind, or messages she\nintentionally conveys. [footnote omitted] That is where we look for\nthe \u2018metaphysics of meaning\u2019. And what needs emphasizing\nis that none of these meaning-properties is constituted in any way at\nall by what the hearer does in trying to interpret what is said or\nmeant (Devitt, 2013: 288).\n\n\nDevitt attributes the confusion between the metaphysics and the\nepistemology of meaning to most contextualist proposals (or what he\ncalls linguistic pragmatism), such as Bezuidenhout (2002),\nCapone (2012), Carston (2004), Crimmins and Perry (1989), Elugardo and\nStainton (2004), Green (1989), Korta and Perry (2008), Levinson\n(2000), Parikh (2010), Recanati (2004), Sperber and Wilson\n(1986/1995), Saul (2002), Stanley and Szabo (2000) and Taylor (2001).\nThe exceptions, on the other hand, would be Bach (1999a, 2005), Neale\n(2004, 2016) and Fodor and Lepore (2004) (for a recent discussion, see\nthe exchange between Korta and Perry (2019a, 2019b) and Devitt (2019)\nin the Journal of Pragmatics.)\n\nRelevance theory, for example, certainly takes pragmatics to be the\nstudy of the comprehension processes of the utterance on the\npart of the hearer (Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995), Carston (2002),\nWilson and Sperber (2012)). And, as Devitt claims, the study of those\nprocesses should not be confounded with the study of what constitutes\nthe pragmatic properties of an utterance. In this case, however, the\nrelevance-theoretic hearer-oriented perspective seems a matter of\ndeliberate choice rather than a confusion.\n\nFollowing Neale (forthcoming), besides the distinction between the\nmetaphysics and the epistemology of meaning, we should also consider\nformatics: the study of how the speaker forms the plan that\neventually causes the production of her utterance. It is reasonable to\nbe clear about these three approaches, because though different, they\nare closely interconnected. The speaker\u2019s beliefs about the\nhearer\u2019s capability of understanding in the circumstances of the\nutterance may affect, and typically do affect, her formation of\ncommunicative intentions, which, in turn, constrain what she says and\nimplicates. Some approaches combine the three perspectives, and being\nexplicit about their difference may be often welcome.\n\nContemporary pragmatics is a large, active, interdisciplinary field.\nThe work we have considered here merges into important work in logic,\ncomputer science and other areas we have not been able to discuss.\nPhilosophers, the founders of the discipline, continue to play an\nimportant role in this field. Philosophically oriented pragmatists (to\ngive an old term a new meaning) usually consider pragmatic issues with\nan eye towards large issues in the philosophy of language and beyond.\nBut in the course of this, they provide detailed analyses and consider\na wide variety of cases that continue to provide ideas and inspiration\nfor pragmatists from other disciplines. There is formal and\ncomputational pragmatics; theoretical and applied; clinical,\nexperimental pragmatics and even neuropragmatics; there is also\nintercultural. Interlinguistic and intersociocultural pragmatics;\nhistorical pragmatics and history of pragmatics. And this list, as the\nwhole entry, is not exhaustive.\n",
