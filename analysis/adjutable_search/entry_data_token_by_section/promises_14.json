    "main_text": "Interpersonal Commitments || Second Personal\n4.2 Second Personal\n\nStephen Darwall\u2019s view makes promissory obligations out to be a\nspecies of what he has called \u201csecond-personal\u201d normative\nphenomena. Second-personal phenomena are many and varied, and Darwall\nplaces promises in the category of \u201ctransactions\u201d, which\nare a group, including contracts and other mutual arrangements, in\nwhich the basic second-personal authority (i.e., the power we have to\n\u201cmake claims and demands on one another\u201d) generates\nobligations to perform what is outlined in the transaction. This\nsecond-personal authority is in turn a normative basic, and Darwall\nargues that this sort of authority is necessarily assumed in all cases\nof agreed-upon arrangement.\n\nDarwall assumes that transactions can engender obligations without an\nexplicit \u201cagreement\u201d. As an example of this he cites\naccepting an invitation. As well Darwall\u2019s second-personal\nauthority story gives rise to explicitly moral obligations, through\nthe mechanism of contractualism: roughly, the sort of authority we\nhave to enter agreements is the sort necessary to ground a\nhypothetical contractualism of the Scanlonian sort.\n\n\nTo begin with the most obvious point, promises are always to some\nperson or persons. There must be a promisee who is given by virtue of\nthe promise an ensemble of rights and prerogatives she would otherwise\nnot have had. But it is also important, as I shall be arguing\npresently is true of all transactions, that it is part of the very\nidea of a promise that the promisee already has some rights\nand prerogatives (hence some (second-personal) authority to make\nclaims and demands) with respect to the promisor, as indeed with\nrespect to every other person, independently of the promise. In\nparticular, the (would be) promisee has the authority to refuse to\naccept a promise. A promise\u2019s existence is conditional on its\nacceptance (or at least not being rejected) by the promisee. I simply\ncannot make a promise to you if you refuse to accept it.\n\nIn this way, a promise is like a gift; it must be accepted or not\nrejected to be given at all. Otherwise, I will have no more than tried\nto promise (or give a gift). Various other rights and prerogatives\nderive from the would-be promisee\u2019s authority to reject the\npromise. Just as it is part of the very idea of a gift that it cannot\nbe forced on someone, so also does a would-be promisee have standing\nto demand that he be genuinely free to reject it\u2014that his\nacceptance not be forced, manipulated, extracted by deception, and so\non. (Darwall, 2011: 269\u201370)\n\n\nDarwall\u2019s work has also led to a new sub-section of the\nliterature, see Watson (2007), Korsgaard (2007), Carassa &\nColombetti (2014), Zylberman (2014), Schofield (2014), Dougherty\n(2015), Kenessey (2020), Roth (2021) among others.\n",
