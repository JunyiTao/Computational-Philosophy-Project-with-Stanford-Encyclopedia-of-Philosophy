According to Taylor,\nDu Bois endorses an expressivist picture of the world, the key to\nwhich \u201cis a determination to think of things as determinate but\nprovisional expressions of an evolving world.\u201d On this view,\n\u201cthe world unfolds into new forms the way a seed unfolds into a\ntree\u2026by clarifying, over time, what was inchoate and implicit:\nby actualizing in history what formerly existed only in\npotentia.\u201d Considered in the perspective of Marx\u2019s\nand Dewey\u2019s revisions of Hegel\u2019s expressivism,\nTaylor\u2019s Du Bois envisions ethical life as a\nwork-in-progress\u2014that is, as an ongoing project of holistic\nself-cultivation, of individuals artistically forming themselves by\ncreatively responding to the histories, languages, and economic\nstructures that constrain them (Taylor, 2016, 91\u201393).\n",
