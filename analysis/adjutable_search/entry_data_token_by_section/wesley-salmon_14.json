    "main_text": "Explanation and Causality || Ontic Conception\n5.7 Ontic Conception\n\nSalmon termed his conception of explanation ontic, as opposed\nto the epistemic conception heralded by Hempel, and the erotetic\napproach defended by van Fraassen (Salmon 1985a [1998] and 1982b\n[1998]). According to the ontic viewpoint events are explained by\nshowing how they fit into the mechanisms operating in the world, and\nthe causal processes and interactions of which mechanisms are\ncompounded are physical entities. In Salmon\u2019s words:\n\n\nTo understand the world and what goes on in it, we must expose its\ninner workings. To the extent that causal mechanisms operate, they\nexplain how the world works. [\u2026] A detailed knowledge of the\nmechanisms may not be required for successful prediction; it is\nindispensable to the attainment of genuine scientific understanding.\n(Salmon 1984: 133)\n\n\nAlbeit he never gave up the task of developing an objective and\nrealistic concept of explanation, in the Nineties Salmon granted the\nimportance of pragmatic considerations in connection with causal\nexplanation. In this vein, he admitted that causal analysis can be\nperformed at different levels of detail, depending on the\ncircumstances. In some cases, phenomena can be analyzed in great\ndetail, based on scientific theories, but more often they can be\nexamined at varying degrees of abstraction, determined by the context.\nIn \u201cA Realistic Account of Causation\u201d, published\nposthumously in 2002, Salmon argued that\n\n\nthe major obstacle to the creation of a fully objective and realistic\ntheory of cause-effect relations is the fact that the instances we\ntend to select are highly context dependent. (Salmon 2002: 123)\n\n\nAfter examining a number of examples he concluded that\n\u201ccause-effect statements are almost always\u2014if not\nalways\u2014context dependent\u201d (Salmon 2002: 125).\n\nThat said, Salmon retained the idea of a complete causal\nstructure including all the processes and interactions operating\nin a certain space-time region. Such a concept bears some resemblance\nto Peter Railton\u2019s \u201cideal explanatory text\u201d (Railton\n1981), the difference being that Railton has a text in mind, while\nSalmon\u2019s complete causal structure is a physical entity. The\nmost important feature characterizing the complete causal structure is\nits objectivity: \u201cthe complete causal structure is a fact of\nnature that exists quite independently of our knowledge or\ninterests\u201d (Salmon 2002: 126).\n\nThe role played by scientific theories within Salmon\u2019s\nmechanistic view should not pass unnoticed. Both causal production and\nprocesses defined in terms of conserved quantities include an appeal\nto theories and laws of nature, because only \u201cour current\ntheories tell us what quantities to think of as conserved\u201d\n(Salmon 1994b [1998: 258]). Similarly, to describe causal interactions\none must appeal to laws such as the conservation of energy and\nmomentum. This led Salmon to conclude:\n\n\nI realize that the theory I am proposing has a highly reductionistic\nflavor. It seems to me that my account should hold in the natural\nsciences\u2014including biology, but not quantum mechanics\u2014I am\nnot confident that it is suitable for psychology and the social\nsciences. (Salmon 2002: 131)\n\n\nA similar conclusion, which further clarifies Salmon\u2019s attitude\ntowards reductionism, is to be found in \u201cThe Causal Structure of\nthe World\u201d:\n\n\nFinally, although my tone in this talk has been rather reductionistic,\nI do not hold a reductionist point of view. It is quite possible that\nother kinds of causation are present in such areas as psychology and\nsociology, where human intentions and interrelations are involved.\nPhysical causation must apply at the basic level of perception and\ncommunication, but there may be more. I would not commit myself to a\nreductionist\u2014or antireductionist\u2014viewpoint unless I had at\nleast an acceptable solution to the mind-body problem, and that is\nsomething I don\u2019t have at present, and I doubt that I\u2019ll\never find one in my lifetime. (Salmon 2010: 12)\n\n\nFurther reading: On Hempel\u2019s theory of explanation see\nHempel 1965 and Fetzer 2010 [2017]. On the notion of probabilistic\ncausality and the relative debate see Hitchcock 1997 [2016] and Beebe,\nHitchcock & Menzies (eds.) 2009. Salmon\u2019s view of a causal\nprocess and Dowe\u2019s conserved quantities theory are discussed in\nDowe 2000. The debate on explanation is surveyed in Woodward 2003\n[2017].\n\nSalmon\u2019s theory of causal explanation had a strong impact on the\nliterature, especially in connection with the biological and medical\nsciences. Bringing to the fore the notion of mechanism, Salmon\nstimulated the formation of the so-called \u2018new\nmechanicism\u2019, see Glennan 2017, and spurred a renewed interest\nin the process approach to explanation, see among others Damman 2020,\nand Nicholson & Dupr\u00e9 (eds.) 2018.\n",
