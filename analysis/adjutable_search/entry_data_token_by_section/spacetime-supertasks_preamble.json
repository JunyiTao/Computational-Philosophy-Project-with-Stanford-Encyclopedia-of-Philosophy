    "main_text": "\n\nA supertask is a task that consists in infinitely many component\nsteps, but which in some sense is completed in a finite amount of\ntime. Supertasks were studied by the pre-Socratics and continue to be\nobjects of interest to modern philosophers, logicians and physicists.\nThe term \u201csuper-task\u201d itself was coined by J.F. Thomson\n(1954).\n\nHere we begin with an overview of the analysis of supertasks and their\nmechanics. We then discuss the possibility of supertasks from the\nperspective of general relativity.\n\n",
