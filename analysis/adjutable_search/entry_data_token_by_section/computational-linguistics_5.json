    "main_text": "Syntax and parsing || Coping with syntactic ambiguity\n2.4 Coping with syntactic ambiguity\n\nIf natural language were structurally unambiguous with respect to some\ncomprehensive, effectively parsable grammar, our parsing technology\nwould presumably have attained human-like accuracy some time ago,\ninstead of levelling off at about 90% constituent recognition\naccuracy.  In fact, however, language is ambiguous at all structural\nlevels: at the level of speech sounds (\u201crecognize speech\u201d\nvs.  \u201cwreck a nice beach\u201d); morphology\n(\u201cun-wrapped\u201d vs. \u201cunwrap-ped\u201d); word category\n(round as an adjective, noun, verb or adverb); compound word\nstructure (wild goose chase); phrase category\n(nominal that-clause vs. relative clause in\n\u201cthe idea that he is entertaining\u201d); and modifier\n(or complement) attachment (\u201cHe hit the man with the\nbaguette\u201d). The parenthetical examples here have been chosen\nso that their ambiguity is readily noticeable, but ambiguities are far\nmore abundant than is intuitively apparent, and the number of\nalternative analyses of a moderately long sentence can easily run into\nthe thousands.\nNaturally, alternative structures lead to alternative meanings, as\nthe above examples show, and so structural disambiguation is\nessential. The problem is exacerbated by ambiguities in the meanings\nand discourse function even of syntactically unambiguous words and\nphrases, as discussed below (section 4). But\nhere we just mention some of the structural preference principles that\nhave been employed to achieve at least partial structural\ndisambiguation. First, some psycholinguistic principles that have been\nsuggested are Right Association (RA) (or Late\nClosure, LC), Minimal Attachment (MA), and Lexical\nPreference (LP). The following examples illustrate these\nprinciples:\n\n\n(2.1)  (RA)\n He bought the book that I had selected for Mary.\n\n(Note the preference for  attaching for Mary to selected rather than bought.) \n(2.2)  (MA?) She carried the\ngroceries for Mary.\n\n(Note the preference for attaching for Mary to carried, rather than groceries,\ndespite RA. The putative MA-effect might actually be an LP-like verb\nmodification preference.)\n(2.3)  (LP) She describes men who have\nworked on farms as\ncowboys.\n(Note the preference for\nattaching as cowboys to describes, rather\nthan worked.)\n\n\n\nAnother preference noted in the literature is for parallel structure in\ncoordination, as illustrated by the following examples:\n\n\n(2.4)\nThey asked for\ntea and coffee with sugar.\n(Note the preference for the grouping\n[[tea and coffee] with sugar], despite RA.)\n(2.5)\nJohn decided to\nbuy a novel, and Mary, a biography.\n(The partially elided conjunct is\nunderstood as \u201cMary decided to buy a biography\u201d.)\n(2.6)  John submitted short stories\nto the editor, and poems too.\n(The partially elided conjunct is\nunderstood as \n\u201csubmitted poems to the editor too\u201d.)\n\n\n\nFinally, the following example serves to illustrate the\nsignificance of frequency effects, though such effects are hard to\ndisentangle from semantic biases for any single sentence (improvements\nin parsing through the use of word and phrase frequencies provide more\ncompelling evidence): \n\n(2.7)   What are the\ndegrees of freedom that an object in space has?\n(Note the preference for attaching the\nrelative clause to degrees of freedom, rather\nthan freedom, attributable to the tendency of degree(s)\nof freedom to occur as a \u201cmultiword\u201d.)\n\n\n\n",
