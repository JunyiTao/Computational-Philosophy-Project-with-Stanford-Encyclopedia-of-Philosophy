    "main_text": "Examining Humboldt\u2019s Writings: Contours, Scope, and Categories\n2. Examining Humboldt\u2019s Writings: Contours, Scope, and Categories\n\nReflecting the extraordinary range of his intellectual interests and\nconcerns, the corpus of Humboldt\u2019s writings consists of a wide\nspectrum of diverse types and genres of texts of which only a small\nportion was ever published during his lifetime. Until this day all\neditions of his works have remained incomplete. His texts consist of\nphilosophical reflections, fragments, studies of varying types and\nlength, notes, diaries, as well as entire treatises and monographs\nwith themes ranging from political theory, anthropology, aesthetics,\neducational theory, literature and history to hermeneutics, ethnology,\nand last but not least, to philosophy of language and linguistics. Not\nto be omitted are the political memoranda produced at the time\nHumboldt held public office, many of which must be counted among his\noutstanding literary and intellectual achievements. There is in\naddition also a sizable corpus of translations from the works of\nLucretius, Pindar, Aeschylus, Aristophanes and others (GS Vol 8) and\nof non-Western works such as the Bhagavad Gita as well as his\nown poetic productions (GS Vol 9). Last but not least, must be\nconsidered Humboldt\u2019s extensive and extraordinarily rich\ncorrespondence that he maintained with a large number of the important\npersonalities of the age throughout his entire life. Noteworthy among\nthese are his correspondence with his wife Caroline (7 vols.), his\nbrother Alexander, Franz Bopp, Karl-Gustav Brinkmann, Charlotte Diede\n(Briefe an eine Freundin), Friedrich Gentz, Johann Wolfgang\nvon Goethe, Henriette Herz, Friedrich Jacobi, Christian Gottfried\nK\u00f6rner, Friedrich Schiller, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Germaine de\nSta\u00ebl, Friedrich Welcker and Friedrich Wolf. An entire group of\nhis correspondence consists of exchanges with scholars in different\nparts of the world and is concerned with specific issues and problems.\nThe bulk of these communications can be found among his extant\nlinguistic papers where they have come down to us in the order in\nwhich Humboldt filed them. His political correspondence forms a\nseparate category and has been published as part of the Academy\nedition in GS Vol 16, 17.\n\nAmong his published writings only the Ideen zu einem Versuch die\nGrenzen der Wirksamkeit des Staats zu bestimmen (The Spheres\nand Duties of Government) 1792, the Aesthetische Versuche\nI (Essays on Aesthetics I) 1799, Pr\u00fcfung der\nUntersuchungen \u00fcber die Urbewohner Hispaniens (On the\nEarly Inhabitants of Spain) 1821, and the\nKawi-Einleitung (Introduction to the Kavi Language)\n1836, constitute complete works in the traditional sense. The majority\nof his writings consist of essays, articles or presentations produced\nfor specific occasions on the one hand and of a large body of\nsketches, studies, notes, expositions and entire treatises on the\nother. Humboldt used the medium of writing as a vehicle of\nintellectual exploration to untangle the complex and diverse aspects\nof a specific problem or set of problems rather than attempting to\nstate a fixed and definite position or opinion, and he would often\nbring to bear different view-points onto the matter at hand and\nutilize varying formulations. It is characteristic of his intellectual\nstyle that he would with consistent philosophical and methodological\nastuteness develop a specific type of questioning that made it\npossible for him to bring to view particular phenomena or sets of\nproblems in their inherent complexity. What lends a sense of unity to\nthe large variety of his writings devoted to so many different domains\nof knowledge, is his consistency in articulating questions, in\napplying a specific viewpoint and perspective, and a recurring use of\nspecific key concepts and their concomitant terminology.\n",
