    "main_text": "Deleuze and the Arts\n5. Deleuze and the Arts\n\nKant had dissociated aesthetics into two halves: the theory of\nsensibility as the form of possible experience (the\n\u201cTranscendental Aesthetic\u201d of the Critique of Pure\nReason), and the theory of art as a reflection on real experience\n(the \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d in the Critique\nof Judgment). In Deleuze\u2019s work, these two halves of\naesthetics are reunited: if the most general aim of art is to\n\u201cproduce a sensation,\u201d then the genetic principles of\nsensation are at the same time the principles of composition for works\nof art; conversely, it is works of art that are best capable of\nrevealing these conditions of sensibility. Deleuze therefore writes on\nthe arts not as a critic but as a philosopher, and his books and\nessays on the various arts\u2014including the cinema (Cinema\nI and II), literature (Essays Critical and Clinical), and\npainting (Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation)\u2014must\nbe read as philosophical explorations of this transcendental domain of\nsensibility.\n\nThe cinema, for instance, produces images that move, and that move in\ntime, and it is these two aspects of film that Deleuze set out to\nanalyze in The Movement-Image and The Time-Image:\n\u201cWhat exactly does the cinema show us about space and time that\nthe other arts don\u2019t show?\u201d Deleuze thus describes his\ntwo-volume Cinema as \u201ca book of logic, a logic of the\ncinema\u201d that sets out \u201cto isolate certain cinematographic\nconcepts,\u201d concepts which are specific to the cinema, but which\ncan only be formed philosophically. Francis Bacon: The Logic of\nSensation likewise creates a series of philosophical concepts,\neach of which relates to a particular aspect of Bacon\u2019s\npaintings, but which also find a place in \u201ca general logic of\nsensation.\u201d\n\nIn general, Deleuze will locate the conditions of sensibility in an\nintensive conception of space and a virtual conception of time, which\nare necessarily actualized in a plurality of spaces and a complex\nrhythm of times (for instance, in the non-extended spaces and\nnon-linear times of modern mathematics and physics).\n\nFor Deleuze, the task of art is to produce \u201csigns\u201d that\nwill push us out of our habits of perception into the conditions of\ncreation. When we perceive via the re-cognition of the properties of\nsubstances, we see with a stale eye pre-loaded with clich\u00e9s; we\norder the world in what Deleuze calls \u201crepresentation.\u201d In\nthis regard, Deleuze cites Francis Bacon: we\u2019re after an artwork\nthat produces an effect on the nervous system, not on the brain. What\nhe means by this figure of speech is that in an art encounter we are\nforced to experience the \u201cbeing of the sensible.\u201d We get\nsomething that we cannot re-cognize, something that is\n\u201cimperceptible\u201d\u2014it doesn\u2019t fit the hylomorphic\nproduction model of perception in which sense data, the\n\u201cmatter\u201d or hyle of sensation, is ordered by\nsubmission to conceptual form. Art however cannot be re-cognized, but\ncan only be sensed; in other words, art splits perceptual processing,\nforbidding the move to conceptual ordering. This is exactly what Kant\nin the Third Critique called reflective judgment: when the concept is\nnot immediately given in the presentation of art. With art we reach\n\u201csensation,\u201d or the \u201cbeing of the sensible,\u201d\nthe sentiendum.\n\nDeleuze talks about this effect of sensation as the\n\u201ctranscendent exercise\u201d of the faculty of sensibility;\nhere we could refer to the third chapter of Difference and\nRepetition, where Deleuze lays out a non-Kantian\n\u201cdifferential theory of the faculties.\u201d In this remarkable\ntheory, intensity is \u201cdifference in itself,\u201d that which\ncarries the faculties to their limits. The faculties are linked in\norder; here we see what Deleuze calls the privilege of sensibility as\norigin of knowledge\u2014the \u201ctruth of empiricism.\u201d In\nthe differential theory of the faculties, sensibility, imagination,\nmemory, and thought all \u201ccommunicate a violence\u201d from one\nto the other. With sensibility, pure difference in intensity is\ngrasped immediately in the encounter as the sentiendum; with\nimagination, the disparity in the phantasm is that which can only be\nimagined. With memory, in turn, the memorandum is the\ndissimilar in the pure form of time, or the immemorial of transcendent\nmemory. With thought, a fractured self is constrained to think\n\u201cdifference in itself\u201d in Ideas. Thus the \u201cfree form\nof difference\u201d moves each faculty and communicates its violence\nto the next. You have to be forced to think, starting with an art\nencounter in which intensity is transmitted in signs or sensation.\nRather than a \u201ccommon sense\u201d in which all the faculties\nagree in recognizing the \u201csame\u201d object, we find in this\ncommunicated violence a \u201cdiscordant harmony\u201d (compare the\nKantian sublime) that tears apart the subject (here we find the notion\nof \u201ccruelty\u201d Deleuze picks up from Artaud).\n",
