    "main_text": "Montaigne\u2019s Scepticism\n4. Montaigne\u2019s Scepticism\n\n With Cornelius Agrippa, Henri Estienne or Francisco Sanchez, among\nothers, Montaigne has largely contributed to the rebirth of scepticism\nduring the XVIth century. His literary encounter with Sextus produced\na decisive shock: around 1576, when Montaigne had his own personal\nmedal coined, he had it engraved with his age, with\n\u201cEpecho\u201d , \u201cI abstain\u201d in Greek, and\nanother Sceptic motto in French: \u201cQue sais-je?\u201d:\nwhat do I know ? At this period in his life, Montaigne is thought to\nhave undergone a \u201csceptical crisis\u201d, as Pierre Villey\nfamously commented. In fact, this interpretation dates back to Pascal,\nfor whom scepticism could only be a sort of momentary\n frenzy.[31]\n The \u201cApologie de Raimond Sebond\u201d, the longest chapter of\nthe Essays, bears the sign of intellectual despair that\nMontaigne manages to shake off elsewhere. But another interpretation of\nscepticism formulates it as a strategy used to confront\n\u201cfideism\u201d: because reason is unable to demonstrate\nreligious dogmas, we must rely on spiritual revelation and faith. The\nparadigm of fideism, a word which Montaigne does not use, has been\n delivered by Richard Popkin in History of\n Scepticism[32]. \nMontaigne appears here as a\nfounding father of the Counter Reformation, being the leader of the\n\u201cNouveaux Pyrrhoniens\u201d, for whom scepticism is used as a\nmeans to an end, that is, to neutralize the grip that philosophy once\nhad on religion. \n\n Commentators now agree upon the fact that Montaigne largely\ntransformed the type of scepticism he borrowed from Sextus. The two\nsides of the scale are never perfectly balanced, since reason always\ntips the scale in favor of the present at hand. This imbalance\nundermines the key mechanism of isosthenia, the equality of\nstrength of two opposing arguments. Since the suspension of judgment\ncannot occur \u201ccasually\u201d, as Sextus Empiricus would like it\nto, judgment must abstain from giving its assent. In fact, the sources\nof Montaigne\u2019s scepticism are much wider: his child readings of\nOvid\u2019s Metamorphosis, which gave him a deep awareness of\nchange, the in utramque partem academic debate which he\npractised at the Coll\u00e8ge de Guyenne (a pro and\ncontra discussion inherited from Aristotle and Cicero), and the\nhumanist philosophy of action, dealing with the uncertainty of human\naffairs, shaped his mind early on. Through them, he learned repeatedly\nthat rational appearances are deceptive. In most of the chapters of\nthe Essays, Montaigne now and then reverses his judgment:\nthese sudden shifts of perspective are designed to escape adherence,\nand to tackle the matter from another point of\n view.[33]\n The Essays mirror a discreet conduct of judgment, in keeping\nwith the formula iudicio alternante, which we still find\nengraved today on the beams of the P\u00e9rigord castle\u2019s\nlibrary. The aim is not to ruin arguments by opposing them, as it is\nthe case in the Pyrrhonian \u201cantilogy\u201d, but rather to\ncounterbalance a single opinion by taking into account other\nopinions. In order to work, each scale of judgment has to be laden. If\nwe take morals, for example, Montaigne refers to varied moral\nauthorities, one of them being custom and the other reason. Against\nevery form of dogmatism, Montaigne returns moral life to its original\ndiversity and inherent uneasiness. Through philosophy, he seeks full\naccordance with the diversity of life: \u201cAs for me, I love life\nand cultivate it as God has been pleased to grant it to\n us\u201d.[34]\n\n\n We find two readings of Montaigne as a Sceptic. The first one\nconcentrates on the polemical, negative arguments drawn from Sextus\nEmpiricus, at the end of the \u201cApology\u201d. This hard-line\nscepticism draws the picture of man as\n \u201chumiliated\u201d.[35]\n Its aim is essentially to fight the pretensions of reason and to\nannihilate human knowledge. \u201cTruth\u201d, \u201cbeing\u201d\nand \u201cjustice\u201d are equally dismissed as unattainable. Doubt\nforeshadows here Descartes\u2019 Meditations, on the problem of the\nreality of the outside world. Dismissing the objective value of one\u2019s\nrepresentations, Montaigne would have created the long-lasting problem\nof \u201csolipsism\u201d. We notice, nevertheless, that he does not\nquestion the reality of things \u2014 except occasionally at the very\nend of the \u201cApology\u201d \u2014 but the value of opinions and men. The\nsecond reading of his scepticism puts forth that Cicero\u2019s probabilism\nis of far greater significance in shaping the sceptical content of the\nEssays. After the 1570s, Montaigne no longer read Sextus;\nadditions show, however, that he took up a more and more extensive\nreading of Cicero\u2019s philosophical writings. We assume that, in his early \nsearch for polemical arguments against rationalism during the 1570s,\nMontaigne borrowed much from Sextus, but as he got tired of the\nsceptical machinery, and understood scepticism rather as an ethics of\njudgment, he went back to\n Cicero.[36]\n The paramount importance of the Academica for\nXVIth century thought has been underlined by Charles\nB. Schmitt.[37]  \nIn the free enquiry, which Cicero engaged throughout the\nvaried doctrines, the humanists found an ideal mirror of their own\nrelationship with the Classics. \u201cThe Academy, of which I am a\nfollower, gives me the opportunity to hold an opinion as if it were\nours, as soon as it shows itself to be highly\n probable\u201d[38], \nwrote Cicero in the De Officiis. Reading Seneca, Montaigne\nwill think as if he were a member of the Stoa; then changing for\nLucretius, he will think as if he had become an Epicurean, and so\non. Doctrines or opinions, beside historical stuff and personal\nexperiences, make up the nourishment of judgment. Montaigne\nassimilates opinions, according to what appears to him as true,\nwithout taking it to be absolutely true.  He insists on\nthe dialogical nature of thought, referring to Socrates\u2019 way of\nkeeping the discussion going: \u201cThe leader of Plato\u2019s dialogues, \nSocrates, is always asking questions and stirring up\ndiscussion, never concluding, never\n satisfying (\u2026).\u201d[39]\n  Judgment has to determine the most convincing position, or at least\nto determine the strengths and weaknesses of each position. The simple\ndismissal of truth would be too dogmatic a position; but if absolute\ntruth is lacking, we still have the possibility to balance\nopinions. We have resources enough, to evaluate the various\nauthorities that we have to deal with in ordinary life.\n\nThe original failure of commentators was perhaps in labelling\nMontaigne\u2019s thought as \u201csceptic\u201d without reflecting on the\nproper meaning of the essay.  Montaigne\u2019s exercise of judgment is an\nexercise of \u201cnatural judgment\u201d, which means that judgment\ndoes not need any principle or any rule as a presupposition. In this\nway, many aspects of Montaigne\u2019s thinking can be considered as\nsceptical, although they were not used for the sake of scepticism. For\nexample, when Montaigne sets down the exercise of doubt as a good\nstart in education, he understands doubt as part of the process of the\nformation of judgment. This process should lead to wisdom,\ncharacterized as \u201calways\njoyful\u201d.[40]\n Montaigne\u2019s scepticism is not a desperate\none. On the contrary, it offers the reader a sort of jubilation which\nrelies on the modest but effective pleasure in dismissing knowledge,\nthus making room for the exercise of one\u2019s natural faculties. \n",
