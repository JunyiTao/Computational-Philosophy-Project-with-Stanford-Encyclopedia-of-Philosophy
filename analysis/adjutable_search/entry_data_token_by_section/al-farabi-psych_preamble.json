He\nwrote extensively on logic, philosophy of language, metaphysics,\nnatural philosophy, ethics, political philosophy, philosophical\npsychology and epistemology. His teachings had a strong Aristotelian\nbackground and at the same time a significant Neoplatonic bent. One of\nthe greatest Islamic thinkers, Avicenna (d. 1037), explicitly admits\nin his autobiography his intellectual debt to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nthrough whom he was able to understand the Metaphysics of\nAristotle. Overall, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b became an important\nreference within the Islamic intellectual milieu as a source of both\ninfluence and contention.\n\nThe precise chronology of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s works is\ndifficult to establish. He wrote treatises devoted to the explanation\nof Plato and Aristotle, commentaries and paraphrases of\nAristotle\u2019s works, and other treatises where he develops his own\nphilosophical thought unifying his metaphysical and cosmological views\nwith his psychology, and even with his political philosophy. His views\nconcerning psychological and epistemological matters appear in several\nplaces within his treatises. Hence, it is necessary to consider\nseveral works where he clarifies and completes his thoughts on the\nmatter. The Principles of Existing Things, also known as\nThe Political Regime (Kit\u0101b al-siy\u0101sa\nal-madaniyya), and The Principles and Opinions of the People\nof the Virtuous City (Mab\u0101di\u2019 \u0101r\u0101\u2019\nahl al-mad\u012bnah al-f\u0101\u1e0dilah), are some of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s major works where he deals with\npsychological topics such as the nature of the soul, its cognitive\ncapacities, and the doctrine of the intellect. Furthermore, there is\nanother important treatise where al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b directly\ndeals with the intellective faculty, namely, The Treatise on the\nIntellect (Ris\u0101lah fi\u2019l-\u2018aql). This\nwork shows signs of the influence of Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the\nsoul and its interpretation by Alexander of Aphrodisias. In fact, M.\nGeoffroy (2002: 191\u2013231) contends that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nprobably never read a complete translation of Aristotle\u2019s On\nthe Soul but knew it through Alexander\u2019s treatises, mainly\nthe On the Intellect. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b addresses\nepistemological topics such as the understanding of scientific\nknowledge and the nature of demonstration and certitude mainly in the\nBook of Demonstration (Kit\u0101b al-burh\u0101n)\nand the Book on the Conditions of Certitude (Kit\u0101b\n\u0160ara\u2019i\u1e6d al-yaq\u012bn). In order to cover the\ndiversity of psychological and epistemological matters in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s works, this article is divided as\nfollows:\n",
