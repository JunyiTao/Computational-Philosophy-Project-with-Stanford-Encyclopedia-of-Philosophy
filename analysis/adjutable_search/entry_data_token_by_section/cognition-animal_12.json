    "main_text": "Animal Cognition Applied to Philosophy || Communication\n3.5 Communication\n\nCommunication is another area in which data from animal studies is\nused to help shape philosophical theories. Many take their starting\nposition from H.P. Grice, who proposed that a speaker means something\nby an utterance x if and only if the speaker utters x\nwith the intention that:\n\nit produces a response in the intended audience,\nthe audience recognizes the speaker\u2019s first intention,\nand\nthe audience\u2019s recognition of the speaker\u2019s first\nintention serves as a reason for the audience responding as it does\n(Grice 1957).\n\n\nDennett interprets Grice as concluding that only those being who can\nentertain a third-order belief (e.g., \u201cI think that she thinks\nthat I think\u201d) can be communicators (Dennett 1987). That would\nentail that only creatures who have a theory of mind, and can think\nabout others\u2019 mental states, are able to communicate. More\nrecently, philosophers have objected to the high cognitive\nrequirements for communication, in part by noting that children and\nanimals often appear to be communicating, expressing their thoughts\nand feelings, or exchanging information in a purposeful way. Current\nresearch also takes seriously that communication need not be limited\nto the verbal domain; communication can occur through gestures and\nother bodily movements, touches, and at least in some species, through\nthe flexible release of chemicals.\n\nFor example, Moore (2016b) suggests that intentional communication\nneed only require a message and an \u201cact of address\u201d that\nsignifies that the message is intended for the receiver. This\npragmatic ostensive communicative account of intentional communication\nrequires that communicative partners be able to understand that others\nhave goals, but doesn\u2019t require understanding others\u2019\nbeliefs. Moore thinks we may find evidence of intentional\ncommunication of this sort in animals from fish to apes.\n\nFor there to be communication, there must be thought, and as we saw in\nthe previous section, some philosophers deny that thought is possible\nwithout language. Dorit Bar-On defends a theory of intentional\ncommunication she calls expressive communication, according to which\navowals are self-reports or expressions of one\u2019s current mental\nstates that have both an action component and a semantic component\n(Bar-On 2004). She argues that an appreciation of expressive\ncommunication can help us see how children and animals who lack\nlanguage may yet still have thoughts (Bar-On 2019).\n\nWhile philosophers are finding value in animal behavior to develop\ntheories of communication, there is less impact on theories of\nlanguage. This is perhaps due to the fact that linguists tend to agree\nwith Noam Chomsky that it is \u201cobviously true\u201d that animals\ncan have systems of communication, but lack anything that can be\ncalled a language (Chomsky 1980: 430). However, continued research\ninto animal communication challenges the idea that human language is\ndiscontinuous from animal communication systems, with evidence of\ncapacities supporting recursion in birdsongs (Gentner et al. 2006) and\nsyntax in bonobos (Clay & Zuberb\u00fchler 2011). Appeal to such\nfindings permits better theories regarding the evolution of language\n(Zuberb\u00fchler 2020).\n\nOn the basis of empirical research into the multimodal communication\nof animals, Eva Meijer (2019) has recently argued that, far from being\nobviously true, it is anthropocentric to restrict the term\n\u201clanguage\u201d to human forms of communication. Instead, she\nsuggests using the Wittgensteinian notion of language games to\narticulate a notion of language that is not fixed and universal, but\ninstead incorporates many different forms of communication that bear a\nfamily resemblance without having any one common characteristic. This\nnotion of language games can include much more than just verbal\ncommunication, seeing language instead as something that is embodied,\nopen-ended, ever-changing and embedded in practices of co-creating\nmeaning, something that need not exclude animals.\n",
