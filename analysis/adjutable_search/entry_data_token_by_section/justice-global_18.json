    "main_text": "Some Issues that Cut Across Several Themes || Allocating Responsibilities for Global Problems\n10.2 Allocating Responsibilities for Global Problems\n\nThere are a number of global justice problems that need to be\naddressed, and this raises the issue of how to allocate\nresponsibilities fairly. Who should do what to reduce global\ninjustices? Several different agents, groups, organizations and\ninstitutions could play a role. Which responsibilities should devolve\nto corporations, governments, consumers, citizens, international\norganizations or social movements? Some frequently discussed proposals\nfocus on agents\u2019 contributions to a problem, their patterns of\nbenefit from the problem, and their capacity to take constructive\naction now. Two influential frameworks deserve more extended\ntreatment, notably that of Iris Marion Young concerning a social\nconnection model for allocating responsibilities for structural\ninjustice and that of David Miller concerning remedial responsibility\n(Young 2011; Miller 2007).\n\nIn contrast to the idea of responsibility as involving finding fault\nand individual liability, Iris Marion Young develops a forward-looking\nmodel which she argues is more appropriate. She draws on the idea that\nparticipation via institutions sometimes produces injustice, so we\nhave particular responsibilities to address injustice. We share\nresponsibility for addressing injustice but we may have different\ndegrees and kinds of responsibility. She offers different parameters\nof reasoning that can help individuals and organizations decide what\nmight make the most sense for them to do in efforts to remedy\ninjustice, given that there are so many injustices, whereas time and\nresources are limited. Using the case study of the global apparel\nindustry she illustrates how the fact that we are positioned\ndifferently can entail varying but important responsibilities for all\nwho participate in activities that sustain sweatshops. There are at\nleast four parameters that agents can use in their reasoning:\n\nPower: we have different levels of influence and capacities to\nchange processes. We should focus on those areas where we have greater\ncapacities to change worrisome structural processes. This might mean\nfocusing on a few key players who have both greater capacity to make\nchanges themselves and to influence others.\nPrivilege: some people have more privilege than others in relation\nto structures. So middle-class clothing consumers have more\ndiscretionary income, choice and ability to absorb costs \u2013 they\ncan change their clothing purchasing practices more easily than those\nwho earn minimum wage, have little discretionary income, and little\nability to absorb further costs.\nInterest: All who have an interest in changing oppressive\nstructures have responsibilities in connection with remedying these.\nThis entails that \u201cvictims\u201d too have important\nresponsibilities since they have a great interest in eliminating\noppression. In a nuanced analysis she argues that they might have\nresponsibilities in certain contexts, such as to speak out about the\nharsh conditions in which they work. They must take some\nresponsibility for resisting and challenging the structures. Without\ntheir participation the need for reforms may be rationalized away or\nreforms may not take the required form. These obligations may not\nalways exist, especially when the costs of resistance would require\nextraordinary sacrifices.\nCollective ability: In some cases we already have collective\norganization capacities and resources that are well established.\nSometimes it just makes good practical sense to draw on these. So, for\ninstance, sometimes student associations, faith-based organizations,\nunions, or stockholder groups already exercise significant power in\nbeing able to coordinate like-minded members who are willing to take\ncertain actions. She encourages us to harness organizational resources\nwhere doing so would prove effective.\n\n\nIn summary, Young encourages us to think about how we can best take\nresponsibility for reducing structural injustice by reflecting on\nthese four parameters \u2013 different positions of power, privilege,\ninterest and collective ability. (For comprehensive review of the\nmerits of Young\u2019s approach see McKeown 2018, 2021.)\n\nDavid Miller offers a tremendously influential connection theory of\nresponsibility that also discusses our remedial responsibilities.\nThere are six ways in which we can be connected to someone, P, who\nneeds help and so be held remedially responsible for assisting. These\nconnections give rise to six ways in which remedial responsibility can\nbe identified. We might be morally responsible for P\u2019s\ncondition; we might be outcome or causally responsible for P\u2019s\ncondition; we might have had no causal role in their condition but\nhave benefited from it; we might have capacity to assist P; or we\nmight be connected to P through ties of\n community.[4]\n\nThere is a huge literature on taking responsibility for remedying or\npreventing future global injustice, including discussing the merits of\nthese two dominant approaches. For some other innovative contributions\nsee, for instance, Barry and Overland 2016, Dahan, Lerner and\nMilman-Sivan 2023, 2016, McKeown 2018, 2021, Brock 2023.\n\nMore recently attention has focused on what those on the receiving end\nof injustice may permissibly do. Alejandra Mancilla (2016) argues that\nthe needy can take what they need and use material resources for self\npreservation even if that requires taking from others. In doing so she\nexpands on James Sterba\u2019s earlier arguments against libertarians\nfor similar conclusions (Sterba 2008, 1996). Also see (Cabrera 2004).\nOthers like Cecil Fabre, Johan Olsthoorn, and Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen\nargue that sometimes poor states may wage war on the affluent for\nsubsistence (Lipper-Rasmussen 2013; Fabre 2016; Olsthoorn 2021).\n[Some, like Peter Unger and Gerhart \u00d8verland argue that it is\nacceptable to force others to assist in poverty-alleviation under at\nleast some circumstances (Unger 1996; \u00d8verland 2009)].\n\nIn the global justice literature, there are also important concerns\nabout the distribution of responsibilities among collective and\nindividual agents. Prominently, can we hold nations responsible for\nglobal injustices or remedying such injustices? This raises important\nquestions about collective responsibility that are well treated\nelsewhere in this encyclopedia (see the entry on\n collective responsibility).\n",
