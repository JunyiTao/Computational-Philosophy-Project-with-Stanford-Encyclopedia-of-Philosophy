    "main_text": "The Origins and Nature of Possibilia || Possibilism Without Bi-Modalism\n2.2 Possibilism Without Bi-Modalism\n\nWe have characterized actualism as, first and foremost, the denial of\npossibilism, defined as the thesis\n (Poss)\n that there are things that contingently fail to be actual. Following\nthe historical precedents just detailed, actuality has been depicted\nas the more robust of two purported modes of being. However, work by\nLinsky and Zalta (1994, 1996) and Williamson (1998, 2013) casts doubt\nupon the viability of the possibilism-actualism distinction under this\nbi-modal conception. Williamson questions its coherence: what,\nexactly, is the nature of the \u201crobustness\u201d that allegedly\ndistinguishes actuality from the merely possible; as Williamson (2013:\n23ff) puts it: \u201cbeing actual had better be actually doing\nsomething harder than just being\u2026. But what is that harder\nthing\u2026?\u201d Convinced there is no cogent answer to the\nquestion, Williamson proposes scotching the possibilism-actualism\ndistinction entirely in favor of an allegedly much clearer distinction\nbetween necessitism and contingentism, that is,\nbetween the thesis that, necessarily, all things exist necessarily\n(\\(\\Box\\forall \\sfx \\Box\\exists \\sfy\\,\\sfy=\\sfx\\)) and its denial.\n(This distinction will be discussed in greater detail\n below.)[24]\n\nLinsky and Zalta (1994: \u00a74) do not so much question the coherence\nof the possibilism-actualism distinction (under the bi-modal\nconception) as dissolve\n it.[25]\n Specifically, they show that, for all that the thesis\n (Act*)\n that, necessarily, everything is actual tells us, there is nothing to\nprevent avowed possibilists like\n themselves[26]\n from simply rejecting the idea that Bergoglio\u2019s merely possible\nchildren \u201chave a [mode] of being that is less than the\nfull-fledged existence\u201d that we enjoy, and insisting instead\nthat they too are fully actual and, hence, exist as robustly as we\n do.[27]\n It\u2019s just that we, by sheer happenstance, are concrete\nand they are not; we, that is, happen to exist in the spatio-temporal\ncausal order and they do not. But things might just as well have been\nthe other way \u2019round: existence-wise, we are all on an\nontological par. There are thus no possibilia in the sense of\n Poss\n at all; necessarily, everything is actual, as per\n Act*.\n On this telling, then, Linsky and Zalta and their ilk all turn out to\nbe fully-fledged actualists, their ontological commitments\nnotwithstanding.\n\nClearly, however, even if one is skeptical of the bi-modal conception,\nthe core of the intended debate remains: whether or not to countenance\nthe likes of Bergoglio\u2019s possible children. In response to those\nwho do, actualists define themselves simply as those who do not. The\nhistorical trajectory sketched above explains why the debate has often\ncome to be framed in terms of distinct modes of\nbeing\u2014actuality and mere possibility. But this\nbi-modal framing is inessential: when the intended debate is kept in\nthe foreground, \u201cactuality\u201d, for the actualist, is best\nunderstood simply as a placeholder for whatever it is that allegedly\ndistinguishes the likes of us (and abstract objects such as the\nnumbers) from the likes of Bergoglio\u2019s merely possible children.\nLinsky and Zalta (1994: \u00a74) and Williamson (2013: \u00a71.2)\nthemselves, in fact, just re-introduce what is essentially\nBolzano\u2019s characterization of possibilia: they are\ncontingently non-concrete. On this characterization,\npossibilism can take a form that clarifies the debate without any\nmention of modes of being and, hence, avoids the above critiques:\n\nPossC:\nThere are possibilia, that is, things that are not\nconcrete but could have been\n\n\nor, more formally, where \\(\\sfC!\\) is concreteness:\n\nPoss\\(_{\\sfC!}\\):\n\\(\\exists \\sfx(\\neg \\sfC!\\sfx \\land \\Diamond \\sfC!\\sfx)\\)\n\n\nAccordingly, actualism becomes:\n\nActC:\nThere could not have been any possibilia, that is, any\nthings that are not concrete but could have been\n\n\nor, more formally:\n\nAct\\(_{\\sfC!}\\):\n\\(\\neg\\Diamond\\exists \\sfx(\\neg \\sfC!\\sfx \\land \\Diamond\n\\sfC!\\sfx)\\)\n\n\nSo on this framing, for the possibilist, what allegedly distinguishes\nthe likes of us (and the likes of the natural numbers) from\npossibilia in the sense of PossC\nis: not being contingently non-concrete. Taking this, then,\nto be what \u201cactuality\u201d signifies, with a bit of\npropositional logic, we have:\n\nA!Def:\n\\(\\sfA!\\tau \\eqdf \\sfC!\\tau \\lor \\Box \\neg \\sfC!\\tau,\\) for any\nterm \\(\\tau\\)\n\n\nThat is, on this framing, to be actual is to be either concrete or\nnecessarily non-concrete; or, more simply put, it is to be either\nconcrete or abstract. It is a straightforward exercise to show that,\nunder this definition of actuality, PossC\nis equivalent to the original definition\n Poss\n and that ActC is equivalent to the\nprinciple\n Act*\n that, necessarily, everything is\n actual.[28]\n\nOf course, possibilists who are more inclined toward the bi-modal\nconception will still prefer the original framing of the debate in\nterms of a primitive notion of actuality as per Poss\nand Act. But even the most committed bi-modalist will\nagree that contingent non-concreteness is at least necessarily\ncoextensive with mere possibility and, hence, its complement with\nactuality. So, for those skeptical of the original framing, nothing\nessential to the debate is lost if it is simply understood in terms of\nconcreteness as per PossC and\nActC.\n\nNote on David Lewis. The influential and highly\noriginal late twentieth century philosopher\n David Lewis\n also rejected bi-modalism and famously defended a view that is often\ncharacterized as a variety of possibilism. In fact, Lewis\u2019s\npossibilism is orthogonal to the classical possibilism-actualism\ndebate under discussion in this entry. See the supplemental document\n Classical Possibilism and Lewisian Possibilism\n for details. \n",
