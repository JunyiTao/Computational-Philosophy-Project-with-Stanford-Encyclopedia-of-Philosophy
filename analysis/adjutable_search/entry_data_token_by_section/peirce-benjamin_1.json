    "main_text": "Mathematics, mechanics and God\n2. Mathematics, mechanics and God\n\n\nTo a degree unusually explicit in a mathematician of that time Peirce\naffirmed his Christianity, seeing mathematics as study of God's work by\nGod's creatures. He rarely committed such sentiments to print; but a\nshort passage occurs in the textbook on mechanics previously mentioned,\nwhen considering the idea that the occurrence of perpetual motion in\nnature \nwould have proved destructive to human belief, in the\nspiritual origin of force and the necessity of a First Cause superior\nto matter, and would have subjected the grand plans of Divine\nbenevolence to the will and caprice of man (Peirce 1855,\n31).\n\n\nPeirce was more direct in a course of Lowell Lectures on\n\u2018Ideality in the physical sciences\u2019 delivered at Harvard in\n1879, which James Peirce edited for posthumous publication (Peirce\n1881b). \u2018Ideality\u2019 connoted \u2018ideal-ism\u2019 as\nevident in certain knowledge, \u2018pre-eminently the foundation of\nthe mathematics\u2019. His detailed account concentrated almost\nentirely upon cosmology and cosmogony with some geology (Petersen\n1955). He did not argue for his stance beyond some claims for existence\nby design. \n",
