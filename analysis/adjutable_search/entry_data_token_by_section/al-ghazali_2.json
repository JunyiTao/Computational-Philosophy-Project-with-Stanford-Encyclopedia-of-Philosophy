Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s \u201cRefutations\u201d of falsafa and Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelism\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee describes the Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers as a \u201crefutation\u201d (radd) of the\nphilosophical movement (Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 18 = 2000b, 61),\nand this has contributed to the erroneous assumption that he opposed\nAristotelianism and rejected its teachings. His response to\nfalsafa was far more complex and allowed him to adopt many of\nits teachings. The fal\u00e2sifa are convinced,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee complains at the beginning of the\nIncoherence, that their way of knowing by\n\u201cdemonstrative proof\u201d (burh\u00e2n) is superior\nto theological knowledge drawn from revelation and its rational\ninterpretation. This conviction led \u201ca group\u201d among the\nMuslim fal\u00e2sifa who disregard Islam and who neglect its\nritual duties and its religious law (shar\u00ee\u2019a). In\nhis Incoherence al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee discusses twenty key\nteachings of the fal\u00e2sifa and rejects the claim that\nthese teachings are demonstratively proven. In a detailed and\nintricate philosophical discussion al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee aims to show\nthat none of the arguments in favor of these twenty teachings fulfills\nthe high epistemological standard of demonstration\n(burh\u00e2n) that the fal\u00e2sifa have set for\nthemselves. Rather, the arguments supporting these twenty convictions\nrely upon unproven premises that are accepted only among the\nfal\u00e2sifa, but are not established by reason. By showing\nthat these positions are supported by mere dialectical arguments\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee aims to demolish what he regarded was an\nepistemological hubris on the side of the fal\u00e2sifa. In\nthe Incoherence he wishes to show that the\nfal\u00e2sifa practice taql\u00eed, meaning they\nmerely repeat these teachings from the founders of their movement\nwithout critically examining them (Griffel 2005).\n\nThe initial argument of the Incoherence focuses on\napodeixis and the demonstrative character of the arguments\nrefuted therein. While the book also touches on the truth of these\nteachings, it \u201crefutes\u201d numerous positions whose truths\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee acknowledges or which he subscribed to in his\nlater works. In these cases al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee wishes to show that\nwhile these particular philosophical teachings are sound and true,\nthey are not demonstrated. The ultimate source of the\nfal\u00e2sifa\u2019s knowledge about God\u2019s nature,\nthe human soul, or about the heavenly spheres, for instance, are the\nrevelations given to early prophets such as Abraham and Moses. Their\ninformation made it into the books of the ancient philosophers who\nfalsely claimed that they gained these insights by reason alone.\n\nAmong the twenty discussions of the Incoherence, sixteen are\nconcerned with positions held in the fal\u00e2sifa\u2019s\nmetaphysics (il\u00e2hiyy\u00e2t) and four with positions\nthat appear in their natural sciences\n(tab\u00ee\u2019iyy\u00e2t). The 17th discussion on\ncausality will be analyzed below. The longest and most substantial\ndiscussion is the first, which deals with Avicenna\u2019s and\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s arguments in favor of the\nworld\u2019s pre-eternity (Hourani 1958, Marmura 1959).\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee denies that this position can be\ndemonstratively proven and draws from arguments that were earlier\ndeveloped by anti-Aristotelian critics such as the Christian John\nPhiloponus (Yahy\u00e2 l-Nahw\u00ee,\nc.490\u2013c.570) of Alexandria. Philoponus\u2019\narguments, most importantly those that deny the possibility of an\ninfinite number of events in the past, had entered the Arabic\ndiscourse on the world\u2019s creation earlier during the 9th century\n(Davidson 1987, 55\u201356, 86\u2013116, 366\u201375).\n\nAt the end of the Incoherence al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee asks\nwhether the twenty positions discussed in the book are in conflict\nwith the religious law (shar\u00ee\u2019a). Most of them\nare wrong, he says, yet pose no serious problems in terms of religion,\nwhere they should be considered \u201cinnovations\u201d (singl.\nbid\u2019a). A small group of positions is considered wrong\nas well as religiously problematic. These are three teachings from\nAvicenna\u2019s philosophy, namely (1) that the world has no\nbeginning in the past and is not created in time, (2) that God\u2019s\nknowledge includes only classes of beings (universals) and does not\nextend to individual beings and their circumstances (particulars), and\n(3) that after death the souls of humans will never again return into\nbodies. In these three cases the teachings of Islam, which are based\non revelation, suggest the opposite, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee says, and\nthus overrule the unfounded claims of the fal\u00e2sifa.\nWhat\u2019s more, these three teachings may mislead the public to\ndisregarding the religious law (shar\u00ee\u2019a) and are,\ntherefore, dangerous for society (Griffel 2000, 301\u20133). In his\nfunction as a Muslim jurisprudent al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee adds a brief\nfatw\u00e2 at the end of his Incoherence and\ndeclares that everybody who teaches these three positions publicly is\nan unbeliever (k\u00e2fir) and an apostate from Islam, who\ncan be killed (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 226).\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s efforts in dealing with the\nphilosophical movement amount to defining the boundaries of religious\ntolerance in Islam. Soon after the Incoherence, he wrote a\nsimilar book about the movement of the Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelite\nShiites, known as the \u201cB\u00e2tinites\u201d (\u201cthose who\narbitrarily follow an inner meaning in the Qur\u2019an\u201d).\nInitially the Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelite Shiites were supporters of\nthe F\u00e2timid counter-caliphate in Cairo and opposed the political\nand religious authority of the Sunni caliph in Baghdad and the Seljuq\nSultans that he installed. During al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s\nlifetime, however, there occurred a schism within the clandestine\nIsm\u00e2\u2019\u00eelite movement. The \u201cnew\npropaganda\u201d of the Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelites in Iraq and\nIran was now independent from the center in Cairo and developed its\nown strategies. A key element of their\u2014not entirely\nunsuccessful\u2014efforts to persuade people to their camp was their\ncriticism of sense perception and of rational arguments\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1954, 34; 1964b, 76, 80).\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee was closely familiar with the\nIsm\u00e2\u2019\u00eelites\u2019 propaganda efforts but did not\nalways have reliable information on their teachings on cosmology and\nmetaphysics. These were deeply influenced by cosmological notions in\nlate antique Gnostic and Neoplatonic literature (Walker 1993, de Smet\n1995). What information he got, al-Ghz\u00e2l\u00ee seems to have\nreceived from the Persian writings of the Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelite\npropagandist and philosopher N\u00e2sir-i Khosrow (d. c.\n1075), who lived a generation earlier in Balkh in Khorasan and in the\nremote region of the Pamir Mountains (Andani 2017).\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee, however, did not know about the schism within\nthe movement. In his book on the Scandals of the Esoterics\n(Fad\u00e2\u2019ih al-B\u00e2tiniyya) he looks closely at\nthose teachings that he knew and discusses which of them are merely\nerroneous and which are unbelief. He assumes\u2014wrongly\u2014that\nthe Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelite propagandists teach the existence of\ntwo gods. Yet this presentation is not so much a misunderstanding on\nthe side of al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee but rather a deliberate\nmisrepresentation, based on a long discourse of\nanti-Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelite polemics (Andani 2017: 193). This\nassumed dualism and the Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelites\u2019 denial of\nbodily resurrection in the afterlife leads to their condemnation by\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee as unbelievers and apostates from Islam\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1964b, 151\u201355 = 2000b,\n228\u201329).\n4. The Place of falsafa in Islam\n\nIn his attempt to define the boundaries of Islam\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee singles out a limited number of teachings that\nin his opinion overstep the borders. In a separate book, The\nDecisive Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine\nUnbelief (Faysal al-tafriqa bayna l-Isl\u00e2m\nwa-l-zandaqa) he clarifies that only teachings that violate\ncertain \u201cfundamental doctrines\u201d (us\u00fbl\nal-\u2018aq\u00e2\u2019id) should be deemed unbelief and\napostasy. These doctrines are limited to three: monotheism,\nMuhammad\u2019s prophecy, and the Qur\u2019anic descriptions of life\nafter death (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1961, 195 = 2002, 112). He\nstresses that all other teachings, including those that are erroneous\nor even regarded as \u201creligious innovations\u201d (singl.\nbid\u2019a), should be tolerated. Again other teachings may\nbe correct, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee adds, and despite their\nphilosophical background, for instance, should be accepted by the\nMuslim community. Each teaching must be judged by itself, and if found\nsound and in accordance with revelation, should be adopted\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 25\u201327 = 2000b, 67\u201370). This\nattitude leads to a widespread application of Aristotelian teachings\nin al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s works on Muslim theology and\nethics.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s refutations of the\nfal\u00e2sifa and the Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelites have a\ndistinctly political component. In both cases he fears that the\nfollowers of these movements as well as people with only a cursory\nunderstanding of them might believe that they can disregard the\nreligious law (shar\u00ee\u2019a). In the case of the\nIsm\u00e2\u2019\u00eelites there was an additional theological\nmotive. In their religious propaganda the\nIsm\u00e2\u2019\u00eelites openly challenged the authority of Sunni\ntheology, claiming its religious speculation and its interpretation of\nscripture is arbitrary. The Sunni theologians submit God\u2019s word\nto judgments that appear to be reasonable, the\nIsm\u00e2\u2019\u00eelites said, yet they are purely capricious, a\nfact evident from the many disputes among Sunni theologians. No\nrational argument is more convincing than any of its opposing rational\narguments, the Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelites claimed, since all\nrational proofs are mutually equivalent (tak\u00e2fu\u2019\nal-adilla). Only the divinely guided word of the Shiite Imam\nconveys certainty (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1964b, 76, 80 = 2000b, 189,\n191). In response to this criticism al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee introduces\nthe Aristotelian notion of demonstration (burh\u00e2n).\nSunni theologians argue among each other, he says, because they are\nlargely unfamiliar with the technique of demonstration. For\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee, reason (\u2018aql) is executed most\npurely and precisely by formulating arguments that are demonstrative\nand reach a level where their conclusions are beyond doubt.\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee wrote in one of his letters to a student that\nlater circulated as an independent epistle: \u201cA [valid] rational\ndemonstration is never wrong\u201d (Griffel 2015: 110\u2013112).\nThis also implies that the results of true demonstrations cannot\nconflict with revelation since neither reason nor revelation can be\nconsidered false. If demonstration proves something that violates the\nliteral meaning of revelation, the scholar must apply interpretation\n(ta\u2019w\u00eel) to the outward text and read it as a\nsymbol of a deeper truth. There are, for instance, valid demonstrative\narguments proving that God cannot have a \u201chand\u201d or sit on\na \u201cthrone.\u201d These prompt the Muslim scholar to interpret\nthe Qur\u2019anic passages where these words appear as symbols\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1961, 175\u201389 = 2002, 96\u2013103). The\ninterpretation of passages in revelation, however, whose outward\nmeaning is not disproved by a valid demonstration, is not allowed\n(Griffel 2000, 332\u201335; 2009, 111\u201316).\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s rule for reconciling apparent conflicts\nbetween reason and the literal meaning of revelation was widely\naccepted by almost all later Muslim theologians, particularly those\nwith rationalist tendencies. Ibn Taymiyya (1263\u20131328), however,\ncriticized al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s rule from an scriptualist\nangle. Ibn Taymiyya (1980, 1:86\u201387) rejected\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s implication that in cases of conflict\nbetween reason and the revealed text, priority should be given to the\nformer over the latter. He also remarked that\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s own arguments denying the possibility\nthat God sits on a \u201cthrone\u201d (Qur\u2019an 2.255), for\ninstance, fail to be demonstrative. Ibn Taymiyya flatly denied the\npossibility of a conflict between reason and revelation and maintained\nthat the perception of such a disagreement results from subjecting\nrevelation to premises that revelation itself does not accept (Heer\n1993, 188\u201392).\n\nOn the fal\u00e2sifa\u2019s side Averroes accepted\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s rule for reconciling conflicts between\nreason and the outward meaning of revelation but he did not agree with\nhis findings on what can and cannot be demonstrated (Griffel 2000,\n437\u201361). Averroes composed a refutation of\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s Incoherence, which he called\nThe Incoherence of the [Book of the] Incoherence\n(Tah\u00e2fut al-tah\u00e2fut). This work was translated\ntwice into Latin in 1328 and 1526, the later one on the basis of an\nearlier Hebrew translation of the text (Steinschneider 1893,\n1:330\u201338). The two Latin translations both have the title\nDestructio destructionum (the later one is edited in Averroes\n1961). They were printed numerous times during the 16th century and\nmade al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s criticism of Aristotelianism known\namong the Averroists of the Renaissance. The Italian Agostino Nifo\n(c.1473\u2013 after 1538), for instance, wrote a Latin\ncommentary to Averroes\u2019 book. While accepting the principle that\nonly a valid demonstration allows interpreting the Qur\u2019an\nsymbolically, Averroes maintained that Aristotle had already\ndemonstrated the pre-eternity of the world, which would elevate it,\naccording to al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s rules, to a philosophical\nas well as religious doctrine. Averroes also remarked that there is no\npassage in the Qur\u2019an that unambiguously states the creation of\nthe world in time (Averroes 2001, 16). Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee was\nclearly aware of this but assumed that this tenet is established\nthrough the consensus (ijm\u00e2\u2019) of Muslim\ntheologians (Griffel 2000, 278, 429\u201330; 2002, 58). While\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee condemns the pre-eternity of the world at the\nend of his Incoherence of the Philosophers, the subject of\nthe world\u2019s pre-eternity is no longer raised in his later more\nsystematic work on the boundaries of Islam, The Decisive\nCriterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief.\n5. The Ethics of the Revival of the Religious Sciences\n\nSoon after al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee had published his two refutations of\nfalsafa and Ism\u00e2\u2019\u00eelism he left his position\nat the Niz\u00e2miyya madrasa in Baghdad. During this period he began\nwriting what most Muslim scholars regard as his major work, The\nRevival of the Religious Sciences (Ihy\u00e2\u2019\n\u2018ul\u00fbm al-d\u00een). The voluminous Revival\nis a comprehensive guide to ethical behavior in the everyday life of\nMuslims (Garden 2014: 63\u2013122). It is divided into four sections, each\ncontaining ten books. The first section deals with ritual practices\n(\u2018ib\u00e2d\u00e2t), the second with social customs\n(\u2018\u00e2d\u00e2t), the third with those things that\nlead to perdition (muhlik\u00e2t) and hence should be\navoided, and the fourth with those that lead to salvation\n(munjiy\u00e2t) and should be sought. In the forty books of\nthe Revival al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee severely criticizes the\ncoveting of worldly matters and reminds his readers that human life is\na path towards Judgment Day and the reward or punishment gained\nthrough it. Compared with the eternity of the next life, this life is\nalmost insignificant, yet it seals our fate in the world to come. In\nhis autobiography al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee writes that reading Sufi\nliterature made him realize that our theological convictions are by\nthemselves irrelevant for gaining redemption in the afterlife. Not our\ngood beliefs or intentions count; only our good and virtuous actions\nwill determine our life in the world to come. This insight prompted\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee to change his lifestyle and adopt the Sufi path\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 35\u201338 = 2000b, 77\u201380). In\nthe Revival he composed a book about human actions\n(mu\u2019\u00e2mal\u00e2t) that wishes to steer clear of\nany deeper discussion of theological insights\n(muk\u00e2shaf\u00e2t). Rather, it aims at guiding people\ntowards ethical behavior that God will reward in this world and the\nnext (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 1:4\u20135).\n\nIn the Revival al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee attacks his colleagues\nin Muslim scholarship, questioning their intellectual capacities and\nindependence as well as their commitment to gaining reward in the\nworld to come. This increased moral consciousness brings\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee close to Sufi attitudes, which have a profound\ninfluence on his subsequent works such as The Niche of Lights\n(Mishk\u00e2t al-anw\u00e2r). These later works also reveal\na significant philosophical influence on al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee. In\nthe Revival he teaches ethics that are based on the\ndevelopment of character traits (singl., khulq, pl.\nakhl\u00e2q). Performing praiseworthy deeds is an effect of\npraiseworthy character traits that warrant salvation in the next life\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 1:34.4\u20135). He criticizes\nthe more traditional concept of Sunni ethics that is limited to\ncompliance with the ordinances of the religious law\n(shar\u00ee\u2019a) and following the example of the\nProphet Muhammad. Traditional Sunni ethics are closely linked to\njurisprudence (fiqh) and limit itself, according to\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee, to determining and teaching the rules of\nshar\u00ee\u2019a. Traditional Sunni jurisprudents are mere\n\u201cscholars of this world\u201d (\u2018ulam\u00e2\u2019\nal-duny\u00e2) who cannot guide Muslims on the best way to gain\nthe afterlife (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 1:30\u201338,\n98\u2013140).\n\nIn his own ethics al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee stresses that the\nProphet\u2014and no other teacher\u2014should be the one person a\nMuslim emulates. He supplements this key Sunni notion with the concept\nof \u201cdisciplining the soul\u201d (riy\u00e2dat\nal-nafs). At birth the essence of the human is deficient and\nignoble and only strict efforts and patient treatment can lead it\ntowards developing virtuous character traits (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\n1937\u201338, book 23). The human soul\u2019s temperament, for\ninstance, becomes imbalanced through the influence of other people and\nneeds to undergo constant disciplining (riy\u00e2da) and\ntraining (tarbiya) in order to keep these character traits at\nequilibrium. Behind this kind of ethics stands the Aristotelian notion\nof entelechy: humans have a natural potential to develop\nrationality and through it acquire virtuous character. Education,\nliterature, religion, and politics should help realizing this\npotential. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee became acquainted with an ethic that\nfocuses on the development of virtuous character traits through the\nworks of Muslim fal\u00e2sifa like Miskawayh (d. 1030) and\nMuslim scholars like al-R\u00e2ghib al-Isfah\u00e2n\u00ee (d.\nc.1025), who strove to make philosophical notions compatible\nwith Muslim religious scholarship (Madelung 1974). As a result\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee rejected the notion, for instance, that one\nshould try to give up potentially harmful affections like anger or\nsexual desire. These character traits are part of human nature,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee teaches, and cannot be given up. Rather,\ndisciplining the soul means controlling these potentially harmful\ntraits through one\u2019s rationality (\u2018aql). The\nhuman soul has to undergo constant training and needs to be\ndisciplined similar to a young horse that needs to be broken in,\nschooled, and treated well.\n\nAt no point does al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee reveal the philosophical\norigins of his ethics. He himself saw a close connection between the\nethics of the fal\u00e2sifa and Sufi notions of an ascetic\nand virtuous lifestyle. In his Revival he merges these two\nethical traditions to a successful and influential fusion. In his\nautobiography al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee says that the ethics of the\nfal\u00e2sifa and that of the Sufis are one and the same.\nCongruent with his position that many teachings and arguments of the\nfal\u00e2sifa are taken from earlier revelations and from\nthe divinely inspired insights of mystics, who existed already in\npre-Islamic religions (Treiger 2012, 99\u2013101) he adds that the\nfal\u00e2sifa have taken their ethics from the Sufis,\nmeaning here mystics among the earlier religions\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 24 = 2000b, 67).\n\nAnother important field where al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee introduced\nAvicennan ideas into Ash\u2019arite kal\u00e2m in a way\nthat this tradition eventually adopted them is human psychology and\nthe rational explanation of prophecy (Griffel 2004, al-Akiti 2004).\nBased on partly mis-translated texts by Aristotle (Hansberger 2011),\nAvicenna developed a psychology that assumes the existence of several\ndistinct faculties of the soul. These faculties are stronger or weaker\nin individual humans. Prophecy is the combination of three faculties\nwhich the prophet has in an extraordinarily strong measure. These\nfaculties firstly allow the prophet to acquire theoretical knowledge\ninstantly without learning, secondly represent this knowledge through\nsymbols and parables as well as divine future events, and thirdly to\nbring about effects outside of his body such as rain or earthquakes.\nThese three faculties exist in every human in a small measure, a fact\nproven by the experience of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, for\ninstance, a phenomenon referred to in the Arabic philosophic tradition\nas \u201cthe veridical dream\u201d (al-man\u00e2m\nal-s\u00e2diq). Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee adopted these teachings\nand appropriated them for his own purposes (Treiger 2012). The\nexistence of the three faculties in human souls that make up prophecy\nserves for him as an explanation of the higher insights that mystics\nsuch as Sufi masters have in comparison to other people. While\nprophets have strong prophetic faculties and ordinary humans very weak\nones, the \u201cfriends of God\u201d (awliy\u00e2\u2019,\ni.e. Sufi masters) stand in between these two. They are endowed with\n\u201cinspiration\u201d (ilh\u00e2m), which is similar to\nprophecy and which serves in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee as one of the most\nimportant sources of human knoweldge. Unlike Avicenna, for whom\nprophets and maybe also some particularly talented humans\n(\u2019\u00e2rif\u00fbn in his language) acquire the same\nknowledge that philosophers reach through apodictic reasoning, in\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee the prophets and awliy\u00e2\u2019\nhave access to knowledge that is superior to that available solely\nthrough reason. \n\nDespite the significant philosophical influence on\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s ethics, he maintained in Islamic law\n(fiqh) the anti-rationalist Ash\u2019arite position that\nhuman rationality is mute with regard to normative judgments about\nhuman actions and cannot decide whether an action is\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d When humans think they know,\nfor instance, that lying is bad, their judgment is determined by a\nconsideration of their benefits. With regard to the ethical value of\nour actions we have a tendency to confuse moral value with benefit. We\ngenerally tend to assume that whatever benefits our collective\ninterest is morally good, while whatever harms us collectively is bad.\nThese judgments, however, are ultimately fallacious and cannot be the\nbasis of jurisprudence (fiqh). \u201cGood\u201d actions are\nthose that are rewarded in the afterlife and \u201cbad\u201d actions\nare those that are punished (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1904\u201307,\n1:61). The kind of connection between human actions and reward or\npunishment in the afterlife can only be learned from revelation\n(Hourani 1976, Marmura 1968\u201369). Muslim jurisprudence is the\nscience that extracts general rules from revelation. Like most\nreligious sciences it aims at advancing humans\u2019 prospect of\nredemption in the world to come. Therefore it must be based on the\nQur\u2019an and the sunna of the Prophet while it uses logic\nand other rational means to extract general rules.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee was one of the first Muslim jurists who\nintroduced the consideration of a \u201cpublic benefit\u201d\n(maslaha) into Muslim jurisprudence. In addition to\ndeveloping clear guidance of how to gain redemption in the afterlife,\nreligious law (shar\u00ee\u2019a) also aims at creating an\nenvironment that allows each individual wellbeing and the pursuit of a\nvirtuous and pious lifestyle. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee argues that when\nGod revealed divine law (shar\u00ee\u2019a) He did so with\nthe purpose (maqsad) of advancing human benefits in this\nworld and the next. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee identifies five\nessential components for wellbeing in this world: religion, life,\nintellect, offspring, and property. Whatever protects these\n\u201cfive necessities\u201d (al-dar\u00fbriyy\u00e2t\nal-khamsa) is considered public benefit (maslaha) and\nshould be advanced, while whatever harms them should be avoided. The\njurisprudent (faq\u00eeh) should aim at safeguarding these\nfive necessities in his legal judgments. In recommending this,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee practically implies that a \u201cmaslaha\nmursala,\u201d a public benefit that is not mentioned in the\nrevealed text, is considered a valid source of legislation (Opwis 2007\nand 2010, 65\u201388).\n6. Cosmology in the Revival of the Religious Sciences\n\nDespite his declared reluctance to enter into theological discussions,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee addresses in his Revival important\nphilosophical problems related to human actions. In the 35th book on\n\u201cBelief in Divine Unity and Trust in God\u201d (Kit\u00e2b\nal-Tawh\u00eed wa-l-tawakkul) he discusses the relationship\nbetween human actions and God\u2019s omnipotence as creator of the\nworld. In this and other books of the Revival\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee teaches a strictly determinist position with\nregard to events in the universe. God creates and determines\neverything, including the actions of humans. God is the only\n\u201cagent\u201d or the only \u201cefficient cause\u201d\n(f\u00e2\u2019il, the Arabic term means both) in the world.\nEvery event in creation follows a pre-determined plan that is\neternally present in God\u2019s knowledge. God\u2019s knowledge\nexists in a timeless realm and does not contain individual\n\u201ccognitions\u201d (\u2018ul\u00fbm) like human\nknowledge does. God\u2019s knowledge does not change, for instance,\nwhen its object, the world, changes. While the events that are\ncontained in God\u2019s knowledge are ordered in \u201cbefore\u201d\nand \u201cafter\u201d, there is no past, present, and future.\nGod\u2019s knowledge contains the first moment of creation just as\nthe last, and He knows \u201cin His eternity,\u201d for instance,\nwhether a certain individual will end up in paradise or hell (Griffel\n2009, 175\u2013213).\n\nFor all practical purposes it befits humans to assume that God\ncontrols everything through chains of causes (Marmura 1965,\n193\u201396). We witness in nature causal processes that add up to\nlonger causal chains. Would we be able to follow a causal chain like\nan \u201cinquiring wayfarer\u201d (s\u00e2lik\ns\u00e2\u2019il), who follows a chain of events to its origin,\nwe would be led through causal processes in the sub-lunar sphere, the\n\u201cworld of dominion\u201d (\u2018\u00e2lam al-mulk),\nfurther to causes that exist in the celestial spheres, the\n\u201cworld of sovereignty\u201d (\u2018\u00e2lam\nal-malak\u00fbt), until we would finally reach the highest\ncelestial intellect, which is caused by the being beyond it, God\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 13:2497\u2013509 = 2001,\n15\u201333; see also idem 1964a, 220\u201321). God is the starting\npoint of all causal chains and He creates and controls all elements\ntherein. God is \u201cthe one who makes the causes function as\ncauses\u201d (musabbib al-asb\u00e2b) (Frank 1992, 18).\n\nGod\u2019s \u201ccausal\u201d determination of all events also\nextends to human actions. Every human action is caused by the\nperson\u2019s volition, which is caused by a certain motive\n(d\u00e2\u2019iya). The person\u2019s volition and motive\nare, in turn, caused by the person\u2019s convictions and his or her\nknowledge (\u2018ilm). Human knowledge is caused by various\nfactors, like one\u2019s experience of the world, one\u2019s\nknowledge of revelation, or the books one has read\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 13:2509\u201311 = 2001,\n34\u201337). There is no single event in this world that is not\ndetermined by God\u2019s will. While humans are under the impression\nthat they have a free will, their actions are in reality compelled by\ncauses that exist within them as well as outside (Griffel 2009,\n213\u201334).\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee viewed the world as a conglomerate of\nconnections that are all pre-determined and meticulously planned in\nGod\u2019s timeless knowledge. God creates the universe as a huge\napparatus and employs it in order to pursue a certain goal\n(qasd). In two of his later works al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\ncompares the universe with a water-clock. Here he describes three\nstages of its creation. The builder of the water-clock first has to\nmake a plan of it, secondly execute this plan and build the clock, and\nthirdly he has to make the clock going by supplying it with a constant\nsource of energy, namely the flow of water. That energy needs to be\ncarefully measured, because only the right amount of energy will\nproduce the desired result. In God\u2019s creation of the universe\nthese three stages are called judgment (hukm), decree\n(qad\u00e2\u2019), and pre-destination (qadar)\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1971, 98\u2013102; 1964a, 12\u201314). God\ndesigns the universe in His timeless knowledge, puts it into being at\none point in time, and provides it with a constant and well-measured\nsupply of \u201cbeing\u201d (wuj\u00fbd). According to\nAvicenna\u2019s explanation of creation\u2014which\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee was not opposed to\u2014\u201cbeing\u201d is\npassed down from God to the first and ontologically highest creation\nand from there in a chain of secondary efficient causes to all other\nexistents. It is important to acknowledge, however, that God is the\nonly true efficient cause (f\u00e2\u2019il) in this chain.\nHe is the only \u201cagent,\u201d all other beings are merely\nemployed in His service (Griffel 2009, 236\u201353).\n\nNature is a process in which all elements harmoniously dovetail with\none another. Celestial movements, natural processes, human actions,\neven redemption in the afterlife are all \u201ccausally\u201d\ndetermined. Whether we will be rewarded or punished in the afterlife\ncan be understood, according to al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee, as the mere\ncausal effect of our actions in this world. In the 32nd book of his\nRevival al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee explains how knowing the\nQur\u2019an causes the conviction (i\u2019tiq\u00e2d) that\none is punished for bad deeds, and how that conviction may cause\nsalvation in the afterlife:\n\n\u2026and the conviction [that some humans will be punished] is a\ncause (sabab) for the setting in of fear, and the setting in\nof fear is a cause for abandoning the passions and retreating from the\nabode of delusions. This is a cause for arriving at the vicinity of\nGod, and God is the one who makes the causes function as causes\n(musabbib al-asb\u00e2b) and who arranges them\n(murattibuh\u00e2). These causes have been made easy for\nhim, who has been predestined in eternity to earn redemption, so that\nthrough their chaining-together the causes will lead him to paradise.\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 11:2225.)\n\n\nAll these are teachings that are very close to those of Avicenna\n(Frank 1992, 24\u201325). Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee also followed\nAvicenna in his conviction that this universe is the best of all\npossible worlds and that \u201cthere is in possibility nothing more\nwondrous than what is\u201d (laysa f\u00ee-l-imk\u00e2n\nabda\u2019 mimm\u00e2 k\u00e2n) (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\n1937\u201338, 13:2515\u201318 = 2001, 47\u201350). This led to a\nlong-lasting debate among later Muslim theologians about what is meant\nby this sentence and whether al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee is, in fact, right\n(Ormsby 1984). It must be stressed, however, that contrary to\nAvicenna\u2014and contrary to Frank\u2019s (1992, 55\u201363)\nunderstanding of him\u2014al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee firmly held that God\nexercises a genuine free will and that when He creates, He chooses\nbetween alternatives. God\u2019s will is not in any way determined by\nGod\u2019s nature or essence. God\u2019s will is the undetermined\ndeterminator of everything in this world.\n7. Causality in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s cosmology of God\u2019s determination\nand His control over events in His creation through chains of causes\n(singl. sabab) aimed at safeguarding the Sunni doctrine of\nomnipotence and divine pre-determination against the criticism of\nMu\u2019tazilites and Shiites. Humans have only the impression of a\nfree will (ikhtiy\u00e2r). In reality they are compelled to\nchoose what they deem is the best action (khayr) among the\npresent alternatives. Avicenna\u2019s determinist ontology, where\nevery event in the created world is by itself contingent (mumkim\nal-wuj\u00fbd bi-dh\u00e2tihi) yet also necessitated by\nsomething else (w\u00e2jib al-wuj\u00fbd bi-ghayrihi),\nprovided a suitable interpretation of God\u2019s pre-determination\nand is readily adopted by al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee although he never\nadmits that or uses Avicenna\u2019s language. In Avicenna the First\nBeing, which is God, makes all other beings and events necessary. In\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee God\u2019s will, which is distinct from His\nessence, necessitates all beings and events in creation. The\nadaptation of fundamental assumptions in Avicenna\u2019s cosmology\ntogether with an almost wholesale acceptance of Avicenna\u2019s\npsychology and his prophetology led Frank (1992, 86) to conclude\n\u201cthat from a theological standpoint most of [Avicenna\u2019s]\ntheses which he rejected are relatively tame and inconsequential\ncompared to those in which he follows the philosopher.\u201d\n\nWhile al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s determinist cosmology is a\nradical but faithful interpretation of the Ash\u2019arite tenet of\ndivine pre-determination, the way al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee writes about\nit in his Revival and later works violates other principles\nof Ash\u2019arism and has led to much confusion among modern\ninterpreters. The remainder of this article will make an attempt to\nresolve current interpretative problems and explain\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s innovative approach towards\ncausality.\n7.1 Occasionalism versus Secondary Causality\n\nAl-Ash\u2019ari (873\u2013935), the founder of the theological\nschool that al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee belonged to, had rejected the\nexistence of \u201cnatures\u201d (tab\u00e2\u2019i\u2019\n) and of causal connections among created beings. In a radical attempt\nto explain God\u2019s omnipotence, he combined several ideas that\nwere developed earlier in Muslim kal\u00e2m to what became\nknown as occasionalism. All material things are composed of atoms that\nhave no qualities or attributes but simply make up the shape of the\nbody. The atoms of the bodies are the carrier of\n\u201caccidents\u201d (singl. \u2018arad), which are\nattributes like weight, density, color, smell, etc. In the cosmology\nof al-Ash\u2019ar\u00ee all immaterial things are considered\n\u201caccidents\u201d that inhere in a \u201csubstance\u201d\n(jawhar). Only the atoms of spatially extended bodies can be\nsubstances. A person\u2019s thoughts, for instance, are considered\naccidents that inhere in the atoms of the person\u2019s brain, while\nhis or her faith is an accident inhering in the atoms of the heart.\nNone of the accidents, however, can subsist from one moment\n(waqt) to the next. This leads to a cosmology where in each\nmoment God assigns the accidents to bodies in which they inhere. When\none moment ends, God creates new accidents. None of the created\naccidents in the second moment has any causal relation to the ones in\nthe earlier moment. If a body continues to have a certain attribute\nfrom one moment to the next, then God creates two identical accidents\ninhering in that body in each of the two subsequent moments. Movement\nand development generate when God decides to change the arrangement of\nthe moment before. A ball is moved, for instance, when in the second\nmoment of two the atoms of the ball happen to be created in a certain\ndistance from the first. The distance determines the speed of the\nmovement. The ball thus jumps in leaps over the playing field and the\nsame is true for the players\u2019 limbs and their bodies. This also\napplies to the atoms of the air if there happen to be some wind. In\nevery moment, God re-arranges all the atoms of this world anew and He\ncreates new accidents\u2014thus creating a new world every moment\n(Perler/Rudolph 2000, 28\u201362).\n\nAll Ash\u2019arite theologians up to the generation of\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2014including his teacher\nal-Juwayn\u00ee\u2014subscribed to the occasionalist ontology\ndeveloped by al-Ash\u2019ar\u00ee. One of al-Juwayn\u00ee\u2019s\nlate works, the Creed for Niz\u00e2m al-Mulk\n(al-\u2018Aq\u00eeda al-Niz\u00e2miyya), shows, however,\nthat he already explored different ontological models, particularly\nwith regard to the effects of human actions (al-Juwayn\u00ee 1948,\n30\u201336; Gimaret 1980, 122\u201328). A purely occasionalist model\nfinds it difficult to explain how God can make humans responsible for\ntheir own actions if they do not cause them. As a viable alternative\nto the occasionalist ontology, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee considered the\nAvicennan model of secondary causes. When God wishes to create a\ncertain event He employs some of His own creations as mediators or\n\u201csecondary causes.\u201d God creates series of efficient causes\nwhere any superior element causes the existence of the inferior ones.\nAvicenna stresses that no causal series, in any of the four types of\ncauses, can regress indefinitely. Every series of causes and effects\nmust have at least three components: a first element, a middle\nelement, and a last element. In such a chain only the first element is\nthe cause in the real sense of the word (\u2018illa mutlaqa)\nof all subsequent elements. It causes the last element of that\nchain\u2014the ultimate effect\u2014through one or many\nintermediaries (singl. mutawassat), which are the middle\nelements of the chain. Looking at a chain of efficient causes, the\n\u201cfiniteness of the causes\u201d (tan\u00e2h\u00ee\nl-\u2019ilal) serves for Avicenna as the basis of a proof of\nGod\u2019s existence. Tracing back all efficient causes in the\nuniverse will lead to a first efficient cause, which is itself\nuncaused. When the First Cause is also shown to be incorporeal and\nnumerically one, one has achieved a proof of God\u2019s existence\n(Avicenna 2005, 257\u20139, 270\u20133; Davidson 1987,\n339\u201340).\n7.2 The 17th Discussion of the Incoherence\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee offers a brief yet very comprehensive\nexamination of causality within the 17th discussion of his\nIncoherence of the Philosophers. The 17th discussion is not\ntriggered by any opposition to causality. Rather it aims at forcing\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s adversaries, the\nfal\u00e2sifa, to acknowledge that all prophetical miracles\nthat are reported in the Qur\u2019an are possible. If their\npossibility is acknowledged, a Muslim philosopher who accepts the\nauthority of revelation must also admit that the prophets performed\nthese miracles and that the narrative in revelation is truthful.\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee divides the 17th discussion into four different\nsections. He presents three different \u201cpositions\u201d (singl.\nmaq\u00e2m) of his (various) opponents and addresses them\none by one. His response to the \u201csecond position\u201d, which\nis that of Avicenna, is further divided into two different\n\u201capproaches\u201d (singl. maslak). This four-fold\ndivision of the 17th discussion is crucial for its understanding.\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee addresses different concepts about causality\nwithin the different discussions and develops not one, but at least\ntwo coherent responses.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of the four parts in the 17th discussion the\nreader must be referred to chapter 6 in Griffel 2009 (147\u201373).\nThe following pages give only an outline of\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s overall argument. In the opening\nsentence of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee introduces the\nposition he wishes to refute and he lines out elements that\nalternative explanations of causality must include in order to be\nacceptable for al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee. This opening statement is a\nmasterwork of philosophical literature:\n\nThe connection (iqtir\u00e2n) between what is habitually\nbelieved to be a cause and what is habitually believed to be an effect\nis not necessary (dar\u00fbr\u00ee), according to us. But\n[with] any two things [that are not identical and that do not imply\none another] (\u2026) it is not necessary that the existence or the\nnonexistence of one follows necessarily (min dar\u00fbra)\nfrom the existence or the nonexistence of the other (\u2026). Their\nconnection is due to the prior decision (taqd\u00eer) of\nGod, who creates them side by side (\u2018al\u00e2\nal-tas\u00e2wuq), not to its being necessary by itself,\nincapable of separation. (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 166)\n\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee lays out four conditions that any explanation\nof physical processes that is acceptable to him must fulfill: (1) the\nconnection between a cause and its effect is not necessary, (2) the\neffect can come to exist without this particular cause (\u201cthey\nare not incapable of separation\u201d), (3) God creates two events\nconcomitant, side by side, and (4) God\u2019s creation follows a\nprior decision (taqd\u00eer). On first sight, it seems that\nonly an occasionalist explanation of physical processes would fulfill\nthese four conditions, and this is how this statement has mostly been\nunderstood. Rudolph (in Perler/Rudolph 2000, 75\u201377), however,\npointed out that not only occasionalism but other types of\nexplanations also fulfill these four criteria. Most misleading is the\nthird requirement that God would need to create events \u201cside by\nside.\u201d These words seem to point exclusively to an occasionalist\nunderstanding of creation. One should keep in mind, however, that this\nformula leaves open, how God creates events. Even an\nAvicennan philosopher holds that God creates the cause concomitant to\nits effect, and does so by means of secondary causality. While the\n17th discussion of al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s Incoherence\npoints towards occasionalism as a possible solution, it also points to\nothers. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee chooses a certain linguistic\nassociation to occasionalism, which has led many interpreters of this\ndiscussion to believe that here, he argues exclusively in favor of\nit.\n\nIt is important to understand that al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee does not\ndeny the existence of a connection between a cause and its effect;\nrather he denies the necessary character of this connection. In the\nFirst Position of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee brings\nthe argument that observation cannot prove causal connections.\nObservation can only conclude that the cause and its effect occur\nconcomitantly:\n\nObservation (mush\u00e2hada) points towards a concomitant\noccurrence (al-hus\u00fbl \u2018indahu) but not to a\ncombined occurrence (al-hus\u00fbl bihi) and that there is\nno other cause (\u2018illa) for it. (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\n2000a, 167.)\n\n\nIt would be wrong, however, to conclude from this argument that\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee denied the existence of causal connections.\nWhile such connections cannot be proven through observation (or\nthrough any other means), they may or may not exist. In the First\nPosition al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee rejects the view that the connection\nbetween an efficient cause and its effect is simply necessary per\nse, meaning that the proximate cause alone is fully responsible\nfor the effect and that nothing else is also necessary for the effect\nto occur. In another work this position is described as one held by\n\u201cmaterialists\u201d (dahriyy\u00fbn) who deny that\nthe world has a cause or a maker (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1959a, 19 =\n2000b, 61). The Mu\u2019tazilite view of tawallud, meaning\nthat humans are the sole creators of their own actions and their\nimmediate effects, also falls under this position\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000, 226.13\u201314). Like in the connection\nbetween a father and his son, where the father is not the\nonly efficient cause for the son\u2019s existence, so there\nmay be in every causal connection efficient causes involved other than\nthe most obvious or the most proximate one. The proximate efficient\ncause may be just the last element in a long chain of efficient causes\nthat extends via the heavenly realm. The intellects of the celestial\nspheres, which were thought to be referred to in revelation as\n\u201cangels,\u201d may be middle elements or intermediaries in\ncausal chains that all have its beginning in God.\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee rejects the position of the materialists and\nthe Mu\u2019tazilites because it does not take account of the fact\nthat God is the ultimate efficient cause of the observed effect. God\nmay create this effect directly or by way of secondary causality.\nDiscussing the example that when fire touches a ball of cotton it\ncauses it to combust, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee writes about the First\nPosition that the fire alone causes combustion:\n\nThis [position] is one of those that we deny. Rather we say that the\nefficient cause (f\u00e2\u2019il) of the combustion through\nthe creation of blackness in the cotton and through causing the\nseparation of its parts and turning it into coal or ashes is\nGod\u2014either through the mediation of the angels or without\nmediation. (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 167.)\n\n\nSecondary causality is a viable option for al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee that\nhe is willing to accept. Still he does not accept the teachings of\nAvicenna, which are discussed in the Second Position. Avicenna\ncombines secondary causality with the view that causal processes\nproceed with necessity and in accord with the natures of things, and\nnot by way of deliberation and choice on the side of the efficient\ncause. The ultimate efficient cause in a cosmology of secondary\ncausality is, of course, God. The Avicennan opponent of the Second\nPosition teaches secondary causality plus he holds that the\ncausal connections follow with necessity from the nature of the First\nBeing. They are not created through God\u2019s deliberation and\nchoice but are a necessary effect of God\u2019s essence.\n7.3 Two Different Concepts of the Modalities\n\nWhen al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee writes that the connection between a cause\nand its effect is not necessary he attacks Avicenna\u2019s\nnecessitarian ontology not his secondary causality. The dispute\nbetween al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee and Avicenna is not about causality as\nsuch, rather about the necessary nature of God\u2019s creation.\nKukkonen (2000) and Dutton (2001) have shown that the two start with\nquite different assumptions about necessity. Avicenna\u2019s view of\nthe modalities follows the statistical model of Aristotle and connects\nthe possibility of a thing to its temporal actuality (B\u00e4ck 1992).\nA temporally unqualified sentence like, \u201cFire causes cotton to\ncombust,\u201d contains implicitly or explicitly a reference to the\ntime of utterance as part of its meaning. If this sentence is true\nwhenever uttered, it is necessarily true. If its truth-value can\nchange in the course of time, it is possible. If such a sentence is\nfalse whenever uttered, it is impossible (Hintikka 1973, 63\u201372,\n84\u20136, 103\u20135, 149\u201353). In Aristotelian modal\ntheories, modal terms were taken to refer to the one and only\nhistorical world of ours. For Avicenna, fire necessarily causes cotton\nto combust because the sentence \u201cFire causes cotton to\ncombust,\u201d was, is, and will always be true.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s understanding of the modalities\ndeveloped in the context of Ash\u2019arite kal\u00e2m and\ndoes not share the statistical model of Aristotle and Avicenna.\nAsh\u2019arite kal\u00e2m developed an understanding that\nis closer to our modern view of the modalities as referring to\nsynchronic alternative states of affairs. In the modern model, the\nnotion of necessity refers to what obtains in all alternatives, the\nnotion of possibility refers to what obtains in at least in one\nalternative, and that which is impossible does not obtain in any\nconceivable state of affairs (Knuuttila 1998, 145). Ash\u2019arite\nkal\u00e2m pursued the notion that God is the\nparticularizing agent (mukhassis) of all events in the world,\nwho determines, for instance, when things come into existence and when\nthey fall out of existence (Davidson 1987, 159\u201361,\n176\u201380). The idea of particularization (takhs\u00ees)\nincludes implicitly an understanding of possible worlds that are\ndifferent from this. The process of particularization makes one of\nseveral alternatives actual. In his Creed for Niz\u00e2m\nal-Mulk, al-Juwayn\u00ee explains the Ash\u2019arite\nunderstanding of the modalities. Every sound thinking person finds\nwithin herself, \u201cthe knowledge about the possibility of what is\npossible, the necessity of what is necessary, and the impossibility of\nwhat is impossible\u201d (al-Juwayn\u00ee 1948, 8\u20139). We know\nthis distinction instinctively without learning it from others and\nwithout further inquiry into the world. It is an impulse\n(bad\u00eeha) in our rational judgment\n(\u2018aql). Al-Juwayn\u00ee explains this impulse:\n\nThe impulsive possibility that the intellect rushes to apprehend\nwithout [any] consideration, thinking, or inquiry is what becomes\nevident to the intelligent person when he sees a building. [The\nbuilding] is a possibility that comes into being (min jaw\u00e2z\nhud\u00fbthihi). The person knows decisively and offhand that\nthe actual state (hud\u00fbth) of that building is from\namong its possible states (ja\u2019iz\u00e2t) and that it\nis not impossible in the intellect had it not been built.\n(al-Juwayn\u00ee 1948, 9)\n\n\nThe intelligent person (al-\u2018\u00e2qil)\u2014here\nsimply meaning a person with full rational capacity\u2014realizes\nthat all the features of the building, its height, its length, its\nform, etc., are actualized possibilities and could be different. The\nsame applies to the time when the building is built. We immediately\nrealize, al-Juwayn\u00ee says, that there is a synchronic alternative\nstate to the actual building. This is what we call possibility or more\nprecisely contingency (imk\u00e2n). Realizing that there is\nsuch an alternative is an important part of our understanding:\n\u201cThe intelligent person cannot realize in his mind anything\nabout the states of the building without comparing it with what is\ncontingent like it (imk\u00e2n mithlihi) or what is\ndifferent from it (khil\u00e2fihi).\u201d (al-Juwayn\u00ee\n1948,9.)\n\nIn at least three passages of the Incoherence\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee criticizes Avicenna\u2019s understanding of\nthe modalities. Here he refers to another, closely related dispute,\nnamely that for Avicenna the modalities exist in reality while for\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee they exist only as judgments in the minds of\nhumans (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000, 42.2\u20135, 124.10\u201311,\n207.4\u201314). He denies Avicenna\u2019s premise that possibility\nneeds a substrate. This premise is Aristotelian\u2014it is the basis\nto the principle of entelechy, namely that all things have\npotentialities and are driven to actualize them (Dutton 2001,\n26\u20137) Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee shifts, as Kukkonen (2000,\n488\u20139) puts it, the locus of the presumption of a thing\u2019s\nactual existence from the plane of the actualized reality to the plane\nof mental conceivability.\n\nWhen al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee says that \u201caccording to us\u201d\nthe connection between the efficient cause and its effect is not\nnecessary, he aims to point out that the connection could be\ndifferent even if it never will be different. For Avicenna, the fact\nthat the connection never was different and never will be different\nimplies that it is necessary. Nowhere in his works requires\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee that any given causal connection was different\nor will be different in order to be considered not necessary. We will\nsee that he, like Avicenna, assumes causal connections never were and\nnever will be different from what they are now. Still they are not\nnecessary, he maintains. The connection between a cause and its effect\nis contingent (mumkin) because an alternative to it is\nconceivable in our minds. We can imagine a world where fire does not\ncause cotton to combust. Or, to continue reading the initial statement\nof the 17th discussion:\n\n(\u2026) it is within divine power to create satiety without eating,\nto create death without a deep cut (hazz) in the neck, to\ncontinue life after having received a deep cut in the neck, and so on\nto all connected things. The fal\u00e2sifa deny the\npossibility of [this] and claim it to be impossible.\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 166.)\n\n\nOf course, a world where fire doesn\u2019t cause combustion in cotton\nwould be radically different from the one we live in. A change in a\nsingle causal connection would probably imply that many others would\nbe different as well. Still, such a world can be conceived in our\nminds, which means it is a possible world. God, however, did not\nchoose to create such an alternative possible world (Griffel 2009,\n172\u20133).\n\nIn the initial statement of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\nclaims that \u201cthe connection [between cause and effect] is due to\nthe prior decision (taqd\u00eer) of God.\u201d When he\nobjects to Avicenna that these connections are not necessary,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee wishes to point out that God could have chosen\nto create an alternative world where the causal connections are\ndifferent from what they are. Avicenna denied this. This world is the\nnecessary effect of God\u2019s nature and a world different from this\none is unconceivable. Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee objects and says this\nworld is the contingent effect of God\u2019s free will and His\ndeliberate choice between alternative worlds.\n7.4 The Cum-Possibility of Occasionalism and Secondary Causality\n\nIn the Second Position of the 17th discussion al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\npresents two different \u201capproaches\u201d (singl.\nmaslak) in order to counter Avicenna\u2019s position that\nthe necessary connection between existing causes and effects renders\nsome miracles in the Qur\u2019an impossible. In the First Approach\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee denies the existence of \u201cnatures\u201d\n(tab\u00e2\u2019i\u2019) and of causal connections and\nmaintains that God creates every event immediately. This is the part\nof the 17th discussion where he presents occasionalism as a viable\nexplanation of what we have usually come to refer as efficient\ncausality. God\u2019s eternal and unchanging knowledge already\ncontains all events that will happen in creation. By creating\ncombustion every time fire touches cotton, God follows a certain\ncustom (\u2018\u00e2da). In real terms, however, combustion\noccurs only concomitantly when fire touches cotton and is not\nconnected to this event. In the First Approach of the Second Position\nin the 17th discussion (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a,\n169.14\u2013171.11) and in some of his later works\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1962), he maintains that causal processes may\nsimply be the result of God\u2019s habit and that He creates what we\nconsider a cause and its effect individually and immediately. When God\nwishes to perform a miracle and confirm the mission of one of His\nprophets, he suspends His habit and omits to create the effect He\nusually does according to His habit.\n\nThe Second Approach (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 171.12\u2013174.8)\npresents a very different explanation of prophetical miracles. Marmura\n(1981) called it \u201cal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s second causal\ntheory.\u201d Here al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee accepts the existence of\n\u201cnatures\u201d (tab\u00e2\u2019i\u2019) and of\nunchanging connections between causes and their effects. In the second\ncausal theory al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee merely points out that despite\nhuman efforts in the natural sciences, we are far away from knowing\nall causes and explaining all processes in nature. It may well be the\ncase that those miracles that the fal\u00e2sifa deny have\nimmanent natural causes that are unknown to us. When Moses, for\ninstance, threw his stick to the ground and it changed into a serpent\n(Qur\u2019an, 7.107, 20.69, 26.32) the material of the wooden stick\nmay have undergone a rapid transformation and become a living animal.\nWe know that wood disintegrates with time and becomes earth that\nfertilizes and feeds plants. These plants are, in turn, the fodder of\nherbivores, which are consumed by carnivores like snakes. The\nfal\u00e2sifa cannot exclude that some unknown cause acts as\na catalyst and may rapidly expedite the usually slow process where the\nmatter of a wooden stick is transformed into a snake. These and other\nexplanations given in the Second Approach are only examples of how the\nprophetical miracles may be the result of natural causes that are not\nfully understood by humans.\n\nMarmura (1965, 183; 1981, 97) rejected the suggestion that\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee might have held occasionalism and secondary\ncausality as two cum-possible cosmological explanations. Marmura\nconceded that al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee makes use of causalist language\n\u201csometimes in the way it is used in ordinary Arabic, sometimes\nin a more specifically Avicennian / Aristotelian way\u201d and that\nthis usage of language is innovative for the Ash\u2019arite school\ndiscourse (1995, 89). Yet in all major points of Muslim theology\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee held positions that follow closely the ones\ndeveloped by earlier Ash\u2019arite scholars, namely the possibility\nof miracles, the creation of humans acts, and God\u2019s freedom\nduring the creation of the universe (1995, 91, 93\u201397,\n99\u2013100). In Marmura\u2019s view, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee never\ndeviated from occasionalism, while he sometimes expressed his opinions\nin ambiguous language that mocked philosophical parlance, probably in\norder to lure followers of fals\u00e2fa into the\nAsh\u2019arite occasionalist camp.\n\nThat al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee considered occasionalism and secondary\ncausality as cum-possible explanations of God\u2019s creative\nactivity is stated, however, in a passage in the 20th discussion of\nthe Incoherence on the subject of corporeal resurrection in\nthe afterlife. The fal\u00e2sifa argue that corporeal\nresurrection is impossible because it requires the transformation of\nsubstances like iron into a garment, which is impossible. In his\nresponse, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee refers to the Second Approach of the\nSecond Position in the 17th discussion where, he says, he had already\ndiscussed this problem. He argues that the unusually rapid recycling\nof the matter that makes up the piece of iron into a piece of garment\nis not impossible. \u201cBut this is not the point at issue\nhere,\u201d al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee says. The real question is whether\nsuch a transformation \u201coccurs purely through [divine] power\nwithout an intermediary, or through one of the causes.\u201d He\ncontinues:\n\nBoth these two views are possible for us (kil\u00e2hum\u00e2\nmumkin\u00e2n \u2018indan\u00e2) (\u2026) [In the 17th\ndiscussion we stated] that the connection of connected things in\nexistence is not by way of necessity but through habitual events,\nwhich can be disrupted. Thus, these events come about through the\npower of God without the existence of their causes. The second [view]\nis that we say: This is due to causes, but it is not a condition that\nthe cause [here] would be one that is well-known\n(ma\u2019h\u00fbd). Rather, in the treasury of things that\nare enacted by [God\u2019s] power there are wondrous and strange\nthings that one hasn\u2019t come across. These are denied by someone\nwho thinks that only those things exists that he experiences similar\nto people who deny magic, sorcery, the talismanic arts, [prophetic]\nmiracles, and the wondrous deeds [done by saints].\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 2000a, 222.)\n\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee maintained this undecided position throughout\nhis lifetime. Given the fact that neither observation nor any other\nmeans of knowing (including revelation) gives a decisive proof for the\nexistence or non-existence of a connection between a cause and its\neffect, we must suspend our judgment on this matter. God may create\nthrough the mediation of causes that He employs, or directly without\nsuch mediation. This undecided position is unfortunately nowhere\nclearly explained. It can be gathered from isolated statements like\nthe one above and the fact that after the Incoherence\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee wrote books where he maintained a distinctly\noccasionalist cosmology (al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1962) and others like\nthe 35th book of his Revival or the Niche of Lights,\nwhere he uses language that is explicitly causalist. In none of these\nbooks, however, he commits himself to the position that the cause is\nconnected to its effect. God may create the two independently from one\nanother or He may create them through the mediation of secondary\ncauses. In his very last work, completed only days before his death,\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee discusses whether God creates \u201cthrough\nthe mediation\u201d (bi-w\u00e2sita) of his creations or\nnot, and maintains that the matter cannot be settled decisively\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1985, 68\u201369).\n\nIn all this al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee accepted the unchanging character\nof this creation. Once God chose to create this world among\nalternatives, He also chose not to change the rules that govern it.\nWhile it is conceivable and therefore possible that God would break\nhis habit or intervene in the assigned function of the secondary\ncauses, He informs us in His revelation that He will not do so. In the\n31st book of his Revival, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee says that\nGod creates all things one after the other in an orderly manner. After\nmaking clear that this order represents God\u2019s habit\n(sunna), he quotes the Qur\u2019an (33:62 and 48:23):\n\u201cYou will not find any change in God\u2019s habit.\u201d\n(al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee 1937\u201338, 11:2084\u201385.) This verse\nis quoted several times in the Revival; in one passage\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee adds that we should not think God will ever\nchange His habit (ibid, 4:12). Prophetical miracles are merely\nextraordinary occurrences that take place within the system of the\nstrictly habitual operation of God\u2019s actions or within the\n\u201cnatural laws\u201d that govern the secondary causes. Miracles\nare programmed into God\u2019s plan for His creation, so to speak,\nfrom the very beginning and do not represent a direct intervention or\na suspension of God\u2019s lawful actions (Frank 1992, 59; idem,\n1994, 20). Given that there will never be a break in God\u2019s\nhabit, an occasionalist universe will always remain indistinguishable\nfrom one governed by secondary causality.",
