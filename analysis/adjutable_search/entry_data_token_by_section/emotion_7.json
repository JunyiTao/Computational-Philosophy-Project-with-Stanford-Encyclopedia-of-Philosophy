    "main_text": "The Hybrid Evaluative-Feeling Tradition in Recent Philosophy || Emotions as Evaluative Perceptions\n7.1 Emotions as Evaluative Perceptions \n\nPerceptual theories come in literal/strong and non-literal/weak\nvarieties (Brady 2013; Salmela 2011). Strong versions generally assume\nthat emotions are genuine forms of perception along the lines of\nsensory perception; weak versions stress key properties emotions share\nwith sensory perception, while also acknowledging important\ndifferences. \n\nPrinz\u2019s Neo-Jamesian theory is a good example of a strong\nperceptual theory. For Prinz (2004), we can speak of a bona\nfide perceptual system when we are in the presence of a dedicated\ninput system with specialized transducers and mental representations.\nSensory perception clearly has input systems dedicated to vision,\nolfaction, touch, hearing, and taste. Following in the footsteps of\nDamasio\u2019s (1994, 2003) neuroscientific work, Prinz suggests that\nemotions can also rely on a dedicated system within the somatosensory\nsystem. Thus, emotions literally are perceptions of bodily changes,\neither at the visceral, hormonal, or musculoskeletal levels, or in the\nform of changes in the somatosensory brain areas.\n\nPrinz adds that emotions are not just perceptions of bodily\nchanges, from which it follows that two emotions can differ from one\nanother despite involving indistinguishable perceptions of bodily\nchanges. For example, fear is not just the perception of \u201ca\nracing heart and\u2026other physiological changes\u201d (Prinz\n2004: 69): it also has a distinctive function\u2014being elicited by\ndanger\u2014and a specific negative valence marker\u2014less of\nthis!\u2014which motivates avoidant action. Since on a teleosemantic\ntheory of representation mental states represent what they have the\nfunction of indicating (Prinz 2004; Dretske 1988), Prinz concludes\nthat perceiving a racing heart can also represents danger insofar as\nit has the function of indicating it (but see Shargel & Prinz\n2018; Robinson 2005). To sum up, subjects literally perceive bodily\nchanges (the nominal content) and indirectly perceive the formal\nobject (the real content) by virtue of the fact that bodily changes\nrepresent formal objects.\n\nWeak perceptual theories take emotions to be relevantly analogous to\nsensory perception or proprioception. In addition, most take emotions\nto be direct perceptions of formal objects rather than perceptions of\nbodily changes with the function of tracking formal objects.\n\nAn influential proposal in this vein is offered by Roberts (2003), who\nholds that \u201cemotions are a kind of perception\u201d (2003: 87) in the\nform of concern-based construals. Roberts clarifies that construals\nare \u201cimpressions, ways things appear to the subject\u201d (2003: 75)\nand that they are concern-based by virtue of being based on the\nsubject\u2019s desires and aversions. For example, a father\u2019s\nfear that a fire will hurt his daughter is a construal of the fire as\ndangerous based on the father\u2019s desire that nothing bad happen\nto his daughter.\n\nAlong similar lines, Tappolet (2016) suggests that emotions are\nperceptual experiences of evaluative properties (a.k.a. values) like\ndangerousness (fear) or slights (anger). Some authors add that such\nevaluative properties are not available through any others means, just\nlike color properties are not available except by courtesy of visual\nperception (see, e.g., Johnston 2001).\n\nTappolet emphasizes that evaluative perception, just like sensory\nperception, is non-conceptual in nature and cognitively impenetrable\n(see also D\u00f6ring 2007; D\u00f6ring & Lutz 2015; Goldie 2000;\nTappolet 2000; Goldie 2002; Wollheim 1999; Charland 1995; Zajonc\n2000). This would explain why creatures who do not possess concepts,\nlike animals and pre-linguistic infants, can have emotions, and it\nwould account for emotional recalcitrance, which can be understood\nalong the lines of a visual illusion. As we visually perceive a pencil\nas bent while judging it to be straight, so we emotionally perceive a\ntransparent platform over the Grand Canyon as dangerous while judging\nit to be non-dangerous.\n\nTappolet (2016) lists additional features that help explain why so\nmany authors have come to think of emotions as perceptions: (a) both\nemotions and perceptions have salient phenomenal properties, (b) both\nare elicited automatically by real or imagined objects, (c) both have\ncorrectness conditions because they represent the world as being a\ncertain way, and (d) both play the epistemic role of providing\ndefeasible reasons for belief (e.g., visual perception for the belief\nthat something is blue, and fear for the belief that something is\ndangerous). \n\nThese analogies notwithstanding, several critics have rejected\nperceptual theories of emotions (e.g., Salmela 2011; Dokic &\nLemaire 2013). A prominent critique concerns their inability to\naccount for emotional recalcitrance. For example, Helm (2001) has\nargued that perceptualists have ended up removing the irrationality\nthat is distinctive of recalcitrance. If perceiving a transparent\nplatform over the Grand Canyon as dangerous while judging it to be\nnon-dangerous were just like a visual illusion, then there would be\nnothing irrational about it, as there is nothing irrational in seeing\na pencil as bent while judging it to be straight. But there clearly is\nsome measure of irrationality involved in recalcitrant emotions:\nunlike perceptual illusions, they motivate us to act. In other words,\nthey involve a passive assent which contradicts the active assent\ncaptured by the contradicting judgment.\n",
