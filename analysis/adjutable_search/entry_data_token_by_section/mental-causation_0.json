    "main_text": "Preliminaries || The Importance of Mental Causation\n1.1 The Importance of Mental Causation\n\nMental causation\u2014the mind\u2019s causal interaction with the\nworld, and in particular, its influence on behavior\u2014is central\nto our conception of ourselves as agents. Mind\u2013world interaction\nis taken for granted in everyday experience and in scientific\npractice. The pain you feel when you sprain your ankle causes you to\nopen the freezer in search of an ice pack. An intention to go to the\ncinema leads you to get into your car. Psychologists tell us that\nmental images enable us to navigate our surroundings intelligently.\nEconomists explain fluctuations in financial markets by citing\ntraders\u2019 beliefs about the price of oil next month. In each\ncase, a mental occurrence appears to produce a series of complex and\ncoordinated bodily motions that subsequently have additional\ndownstream effects in the physical world. Instances of apparent mental\ncausation are so common that they often go unremarked, but they are\ncentral to the commonsense picture we have of ourselves. It\u2019s\nnot surprising, then, that questions about the nature and possibility\nof mental causation arise in a variety of philosophical contexts.\n\nOntology: Suppose you accept the \u201cEleatic Principle\u201d that\npower is the mark of being: to exist is to have causal powers\n(Armstrong 1978, pp. 45\u20136; Oddie 1982). It\u2019s plausible to\nthink that if the mental has any causal powers at all, it can affect\nthe physical world. Without such powers, the mental faces ontological\nembarrassment, even elimination.\n\nMetaphysics: Mental causation is \u201cat the heart of the mind-body\nproblem\u201d (Shoemaker 2001, p. 74), often figuring explicitly in\nhow the problem is formulated (Mackie 1979; Campbell 1984; Crane\n1999). To ask how mind and body are related just is, in part, to ask\nhow they could possibly affect one another.\n\nMoral psychology: Agency of the sort required for\n free will\n and\n moral responsibility\n appears to require mental causation. If your behavior is not caused\nby your mind\u2019s activities\u2014its deliberations, decisions,\nand the like\u2014what sense would it make to hold you responsible\nfor what your body does? You would appear to be scarcely more than a\npassive observer of your body\u2019s activities. We would then need\nto abandon what\n Strawson\n (1962) calls our \u201creactive attitudes\u201d, the moral\nattitudes and feelings (e.g., gratitude, resentment) so central to our\ninterpersonal lives.\n\nAction theory: It is widely believed that psychological explanation\nhinges on the possibility of mental causation. If your mind and its\nstates, such as your beliefs and desires, were causally isolated from\nyour bodily behavior, then what goes on in your mind could not explain\nwhat you do (Davidson 1963; Mele 1992; for dissent, see\n\u201cnoncausalists\u201d such as Ginet 1990; Sehon 2005; Tanney\n2013; and see the essays in D\u2019Oro 2013). These observations\nabout agency suggest a more basic conceptual point: if minds did not\ninfluence behavior, in what sense would anyone truly act?\nSounds would be made, but no one would mean anything by them. Bodies\nwould move, but no one would thereby do anything (Malcolm 1968; Horgan\n2007).\n\nAlthough each of the above points could be contested, collectively\nthey create pressure to address the problem of mental\ncausation\u2014problem or problems: as will become clear,\nthere is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind\u2019s\ncausal efficacy can arise.\n",
