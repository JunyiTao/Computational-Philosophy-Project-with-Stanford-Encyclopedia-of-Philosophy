    "main_text": "The Philosophical System of the Periphyseon || The Four Divisions of Nature\n3.1 The Four Divisions of Nature\n\nBook One opens abruptly with the claim that \u201cnature\u201d\n(natura), \u201cthe general term for all things that are and\nall things that are not\u201d, (I.441a), including both God and\ncreation, is divided into four species. Echoing similar divisions in\nAugustine (De civitate Dei Bk. V. 9, PL 41: 151) and Marius\nVictorinus (Ad Candidum), nature\u2019s four\n\u201cdivisions\u201d or \u201cspecies\u201d are: that which\ncreates and is not created (i.e., God); that which creates and is\ncreated (i.e., Primary Causes or Ideas); that which is created and\ndoes not create (i.e., Temporal Effects, created things); that which\nis neither created nor creates (i.e., non-being, nothingness). The\nfirst species of nature is God, \u201cthe cause of all things that\nare and that are not\u201d (I.442b). There are several remarkable\naspects of this division. First of all, division is defined by\nEriugena in De praedestinatione as a branch of dialectic.\nSecondly, the four divisions are not strictly a hierarchy in the usual\nNeoplatonic sense where there are higher and lower orders, rather, as\nEriugena will explain, the first and fourth divisions both refer to\nGod as the Beginning and End of all things, and the second and third\ndivisions may also be thought to express the unity of the cause-effect\nrelation. Finally, the division is an attempt to show that nature is a\ndialectical coming together of being and non-being. Creation is\nnormally understood as coming into being from non-being. God as\ncreator is then a kind of transcendent non-being above the being of\ncreation. These themes are rigorously discussed and disentangled\nthroughout the dialogue.\n",
