    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nBorn in Mantua, Pomponazzi studied at Padua, obtaining his degree in\narts in 1487. He then taught there, first as extraordinary and then\nordinary professor from 1488\u20131496 (Nardi 1965: 54\u201355). His\nteacher and fellow professor at Padua Nicoletto Vernia as well as his\ncolleague Alessandro Achillini openly endorsed Averroes\u2019 view of\nthe unicity of the material intellect, a view that Bishop Pietro\nBarrozzi condemned with the threat of excommunication in 1489, leading\nthem to revise or hide their teachings (Hasse 2016: 184\u2013214).\nPomponazzi questioned and ultimately rejected Averroes\u2019 unicity\nposition. Perhaps influenced by his other teachers Pietro Trapolino\nand Francesco Securo da Nard\u00f2, he respected Thomas\nAquinas\u2019s views even if he found them to use theological\npremises that he believed were unwelcome in natural philosophy\nand contrary to Aristotle\u2019s philosophy. Despite rejecting\nAverroes\u2019 view on the material intellect, throughout his career,\nPomponazzi\u2019s lectures relied on Averroes\u2019 commentaries.\nFor example, among Pomponazzi\u2019s writings are\nquaestiones based on Averroes\u2019 De substantia\norbis (On the Substance of the Orbs). Around 1496, he\nobtained a doctorate in medicine (Oliva 1926: 179), a common step for\nthose who wished to rise in the universities of northern Italy, where\nphilosophy was often taught as preparation to the study of medicine\n(see Kristeller 1993: vol. 3, 436\u201338; Kraye 2010: 93). Although\nPomponazzi never taught medicine he was consulted for his medical\nexpertise (see Park 2006: 175\u201376) and frequently considered\nmedical teachings in his writings on wondrous phenomena,\nAristotle\u2019s zoological writings, and Meteorologica IV\n(see Perfetti 2004: xliii\u2013xlv; Martin 2002). During this first\nstint at Padua, he wrote Quaestio de maximo et minimo\n(Question on the Maximum and the Minimum), which\nattacked William Heytesbury and the calculatory tradition (see\nBiard 2009). Beginning in the 1330s, Heytesbury and others at Merton\nCollege at Oxford applied mathematical and logical analysis on a range\nof topics, including natural philosophical questions regarding\nkinematics. Pomponazzi remained hostile to the calculatory and\nterminist traditions throughout his life because he considered their\ninterpretations of Aristotle\u2019s texts as veering too far from a\nstrict exegesis of Aristotle. In 1496, Pomponazzi left Padua, after\ndisputing with Agostino Nifo, and tutored Prince Alberto Pio da Carpi,\nwho was in exile at Ferrara. Alberto Pio remained for years a\nsupporter of Aristotelian thought, commissioning translations of\nAverroes and Aristotle, and Pomponazzi dedicated his 1514 De\nintensione et remissione formarum (On the Intension and\nRemission of Forms) to him (see Schmitt 1984).\n\nAfter returning to Padua in 1499, he taught natural philosophy there\nuntil 1509, when the university closed due to the War of the League of\nCambrai. He stayed briefly in Ferrara, where he taught at\nthe university for a year, and then returned to his native\nMantua, before moving to the university of Bologna in\n1511. He remained there for the rest of his life, teaching\nnatural and moral philosophy (Oliva 1926: 265). His years at Bologna\nwere both productive and filled with controversy, including being\nunsuccessfully accused of heresy in 1514 and in 1518 (Nardi 1965: 70;\nBianchi 2008: 132). All his works printed during the sixteenth century\nstem from his tenure at Bologna (Lohr 1988: 347\u201362). In\n1514 he completed a disputation on the intension and remission of\nforms; and in 1515 he published the question De reactione\n(On Reaction). A year later he published Tractatus de\nimmortalitate animae (Treatise on the Immortality of the\nSoul). The work defends a materialist reading of Aristotle in\nwhich the human soul depends on and perishes with the body. The\ntreatise came out three years after the Fifth Lateran Council issued\nthe bull Apostolici regiminis. The bull demanded that\nphilosophers refrain from teaching that the soul is one in number or\nmortal and that the universe eternal. It also demanded that\nphilosophers defend Christian doctrine to the best of their ability.\nAs Pomponazzi\u2019s teaching appeared to many to run against the\nbull, he was attacked, but also defended, by a number of scholars and\necclesiastical authorities. Although he was denounced as a heretic, he\nwas not tried and never abjured, protected by the powerful\nVenetian Cardinal Pietro Bembo (see Bianchi 2008: 130\u201334; Pine 1986:\n124\u201328).\n\nDespite these controversies, Pomponazzi maintained his position at\nBologna and continued to teach and write, pursuing many of the themes\nfound in his psychological writings. In 1520, he completed De\nnaturalium effectuum admirandorum causis sive de incantationibus\n(On the Causes of Marvelous Natural Effects or On\nIncantations). The work circulated in manuscript widely before\nbeing printed first in 1556 and again in 1567 (Regnicoli 2010). In the\nsame year he finished De fato, de libero arbitrio, de\npraedestinatione (On Fate, Free Will, On\nPredestination), which was not printed until 1567. In 1521, he\npublished De nutritione et augmentatione (On Nutrition\nand Growth). Given greater freedom to choose the subject of his\nlectures as the result of contract negotiations, Pomponazzi lectured\non a number of Aristotle\u2019s writings that were not part of the\ntypical duties of an ordinary professor. These topics include\nAristotle\u2019s De generatione et corruptione and his\nzoological and meteorological writings. His Dubitationes in\nquartum Meteorologicorum librum (Doubts on Meteorologica\nIV) were printed in 1563. Pomponazzi, after several years of illness,\ndied from kidney disease in 1525 (Nardi 1965: 205\u20136).\n",
