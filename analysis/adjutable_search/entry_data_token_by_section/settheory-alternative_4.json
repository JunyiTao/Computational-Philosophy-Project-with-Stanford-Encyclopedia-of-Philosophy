    "main_text": "Naive Set Theory || The other paradoxes of naive set theory\n2.1 The other paradoxes of naive set theory\n\nTwo other paradoxes of naive set theory are usually mentioned, the\nparadox of Burali-Forti (1897)\u2014which has historical\nprecedence\u2014and the paradox of Cantor. To review these other\nparadoxes is a convenient way to review as well what the early set\ntheorists were up to, so we will do it. Our formal presentation of\nthese paradoxes is anachronistic; we are interested in their\nmathematical content, but not necessarily in the exact way that they\nwere originally presented.\n\nCantor in his theory of sets was concerned with defining notions of\ninfinite cardinal number and infinite ordinal number. Consideration of\nthe largest ordinal number gave rise to the Burali-Forti paradox, and\nconsideration of the largest cardinal number gave rise to the Cantor\nparadox.\n\nInfinite ordinals can be presented in naive set theory as isomorphism\nclasses of well-orderings (a well-ordering is a linear order \\(\\le\\)\nwith the property that any nonempty subset of its domain has a\n\\(\\le\\)-least element). We use reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive\nrelations \\(\\le\\) as our linear orders rather than the associated\nirreflexive, asymmetric, transitive relations \\(\\lt\\), because this\nallows us to distinguish between the ordinal numbers 0 and 1 (Russell\nand Whitehead took the latter approach and were unable to define an\nordinal number 1 in their Principia Mathematica).\n\nThere is a natural order on ordinal numbers (induced by the fact that\nof any two well-orderings, at least one will be isomorphic to an\ninitial segment of the other) and it is straightforward to show that\nit is a well-ordering. Since it is a well-ordering, it belongs to an\nisomorphism class (an ordinal number!) \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nIt is also straightforward to show that the order type of the natural\norder on the ordinals restricted to the ordinals less than \\(\\alpha\\)\nis \\(\\alpha\\): the order on \\(\\{0, 1, 2\\}\\) is of order type 3, the\norder on the finite ordinals \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots \\}\\) is the first\ninfinite ordinal \\(\\omega\\), and so forth.\n\nBut then the order type of the ordinals \\(\\lt \\Omega\\) is \\(\\Omega\\)\nitself, which means that the order type of all the ordinals\n(including \\(\\Omega)\\) is \u201cgreater\u201d\u2014but \\(\\Omega\\)\nwas defined as the order type of all the ordinals and should not be\ngreater than itself!\n\nThis paradox was presented first (Cantor was aware of it) and Cantor\ndid not think that it invalidated his system.\n\nCantor defined two sets as having the same cardinal number if there\nwas a bijection between them. This is of course simply common sense in\nthe finite realm; his originality lay in extending it to the infinite\nrealm and refusing to shy from the apparently paradoxical results. In\nthe infinite realm, cardinal and ordinal number are not isomorphic\nnotions as they are in the finite realm: a well-ordering of order type\n\\(\\omega\\) (say, the usual order on the natural numbers) and a\nwell-ordering of order type \\(\\omega + \\omega\\) (say, the order on the\nnatural numbers which puts all odd numbers before all even numbers and\nputs the sets of odd and even numbers in their usual order) represent\ndifferent ordinal numbers but their fields (being the same set!) are\ncertainly of the same size. Such \u201cparadoxes\u201d as the\napparent equinumerousness of the natural numbers and the perfect\nsquares (noted by Galileo) and the one-to-one correspondence between\nthe points on concentric circles of different radii, noted since the\nMiddle Ages, were viewed as matter-of-fact evidence for\nequinumerousness of particular infinite sets by Cantor.\n\nNovel with Cantor was the demonstration (1872) that there are infinite\nsets of different sizes according to this criterion. Cantor\u2019s\nparadox, for which an original reference is difficult to find, is an\nimmediate corollary of this result. If \\(A\\) is a set, define the\npower set of \\(A\\) as the set of all subsets of \\(A: \\wp(A) =\n\\{B \\mid \\forall x(x \\in B \\rightarrow x \\in A)\\}\\). Cantor proved\nthat there can be no bijection between \\(A\\) and \\(\\wp(A)\\) for any\nset \\(A\\). Suppose that \\(f\\) is a bijection from \\(A\\) to \\(\\wp(A)\\).\nDefine \\(C\\) as \\(\\{a \\in A \\mid a \\not\\in f(a)\\}\\). Because \\(f\\) is\na bijection there must be \\(c\\) such that \\(f(c) = C\\). Now we notice\nthat \\(c \\in C \\leftrightarrow c \\not\\in f (c) = C\\), which is a\ncontradiction.\n\nCantor\u2019s theorem just proved shows that for any set \\(A\\), there\nis a set \\(\\wp(A)\\) which is larger. Cantor\u2019s paradox arises if\nwe try to apply Cantor\u2019s theorem to the set of all sets (or to\nthe universal set, if we suppose (with common sense) that not all\nobjects are sets). If \\(V\\) is the universal set, then \\(\\wp(V)\\), the\npower set of the universal set (the set of all sets) must have larger\ncardinality than \\(V\\). But clearly no set can be larger in\ncardinality than the set which contains everything!\n\nCantor\u2019s response to both of these paradoxes was telling (and\ncan be formalized in ZFC or in the related systems which\nadmit proper classes, as we will see below). He essentially reinvoked\nthe classical objections to infinite sets on a higher level. Both the\nlargest cardinal and the largest ordinal arise from considering the\nvery largest collections (such as the universe \\(V)\\). Cantor drew a\ndistinction between legitimate mathematical infinities such as the\ncountable infinity of the natural numbers (with its associated\ncardinal number \\(\\aleph_0\\) and many ordinal numbers \\(\\omega ,\n\\omega + 1, \\ldots ,\\omega + \\omega ,\\ldots)\\), the larger infinity of\nthe continuum, and further infinities derived from these, which he\ncalled transfinite, and what he called the Absolute Infinite,\nthe infinity of the collection containing everything and of such\nrelated notions as the largest cardinal and the largest ordinal. In\nthis he followed St. Augustine (De Civitate Dei) who argued\nin late classical times that the infinite collection of natural\nnumbers certainly existed as an actual infinity because God was aware\nof each and every natural number, but because God\u2019s knowledge\nencompassed all the natural numbers their totality was somehow finite\nin His sight. The fact that his defense of set theory against the\nBurali-Forti and Cantor paradoxes was subsequently successfully\nformalized in ZFC and the related class systems leads some to\nbelieve that Cantor\u2019s own set theory was not implicated in the\nparadoxes.\n",
