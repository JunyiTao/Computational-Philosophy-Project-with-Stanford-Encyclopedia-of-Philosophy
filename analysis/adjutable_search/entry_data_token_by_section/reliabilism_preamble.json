    "main_text": "\n\nOne of the main goals of epistemologists is to provide a substantive\nand explanatory account of the conditions under which a belief has\nsome desirable epistemic status (typically, justification or\nknowledge). According to the reliabilist approach to epistemology, any\nadequate account will need to mention the reliability of the process\nresponsible for the belief, or truth-conducive considerations more\ngenerally. Historically, one major motivation for\nreliabilism\u2014and one source of its enduring interest\u2014is its\nnaturalistic potential. According to reliabilists, epistemic\nproperties can be explained in terms of reliability, which in turn can\nbe understood without reference to any unreduced epistemic notions,\nsuch as evidence or knowledge.\n\nThis article begins by surveying some of the main forms of\nreliabilism, concentrating on process reliabilism as a theory of\njustification. It proceeds to review some of the main objections to\nreliabilism, and some of the responses that have been offered on the\nreliabilist\u2019s behalf. After canvassing some recent developments\nin reliabilist epistemology, the article concludes by considering\nvarious cousins and spin-offs of reliabilist epistemology, including\nvirtue reliabilism and various evidentialist-reliabilist hybrids.\n",
