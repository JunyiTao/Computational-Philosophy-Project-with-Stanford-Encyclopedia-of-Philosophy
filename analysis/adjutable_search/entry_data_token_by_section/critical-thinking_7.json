    "main_text": "Its Value\n4. Its Value\n\nDewey thought that education for reflective thinking would be of value\nto both the individual and society; recognition in educational\npractice of the kinship to the scientific attitude of children\u2019s\nnative curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry\n\u201cwould make for individual happiness and the reduction of social\nwaste\u201d (Dewey 1910: iii). Schools participating in the\nEight-Year Study took development of the habit of reflective thinking\nand skill in solving problems as a means to leading young people to\nunderstand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life\ncharacteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17\u201318, 81).\nHarvey Siegel (1988: 55\u201361) has offered four considerations in\nsupport of adopting critical thinking as an educational ideal. (1)\nRespect for persons requires that schools and teachers honour\nstudents\u2019 demands for reasons and explanations, deal with\nstudents honestly, and recognize the need to confront students\u2019\nindependent judgment; these requirements concern the manner in which\nteachers treat students. (2) Education has the task of preparing\nchildren to be successful adults, a task that requires development of\ntheir self-sufficiency. (3) Education should initiate children into\nthe rational traditions in such fields as history, science and\nmathematics. (4) Education should prepare children to become\ndemocratic citizens, which requires reasoned procedures and critical\ntalents and attitudes. To supplement these considerations, Siegel\n(1988: 62\u201390) responds to two objections: the ideology objection\nthat adoption of any educational ideal requires a prior ideological\ncommitment and the indoctrination objection that cultivation of\ncritical thinking cannot escape being a form of indoctrination.\n",
