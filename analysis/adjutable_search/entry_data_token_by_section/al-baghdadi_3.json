Criticisms against the Moderns \n\nAbd al-Latif constantly held authors defined by him as Moderns\ndistinct from the Ancients and he unleashed a harsh polemic attack\nagainst the works of the former. His privileged targets were Avicenna\nand Fakhr al-Din al-Razi whom he considered, as far as it was\npossible, even worse than Avicenna. The writings of these authors in\nfact, if compared with those of the Ancients, reveal their low\nscientific level, are confused, and lack detailed analysis.\n",
