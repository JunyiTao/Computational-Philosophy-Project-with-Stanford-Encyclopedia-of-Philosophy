    "main_text": "Attributes in the Short Treatise\n2. Attributes in the Short Treatise\n\nIn the Short Treatise Spinoza develops ideas that will come\nto a full articulation later on in the Ethics, such as the\nidea that, strictly speaking, there are only two attributes through\nwhich we can properly come to have knowledge of God\u2014Thought and\nExtension. However, unlike in the Ethics, he does not simply\ndismiss the more traditional attributes such as omnipotence,\neternality, immutability, and infinity. To maintain some sense of\nthese traditional divine attributes, Spinoza explains that they are\nnot attributes strictly speaking, but rather propria of God.\nThis is stated first clearly in the first footnote to Chapter III\n(\u201cHow God is the Cause of All Things\u201d):\n\nThe following are called Propria because they are nothing but\nAdjectives which cannot be understood without their\nSubstantives. I.e., without them God would indeed not be God;\nbut still, he is not God through them, for they do not make known\nanything substantial, and it is only through what is substantial that\nGod exists.\n\n\nSpinoza then, is distinguishing between that which gives us knowledge\nof God, or better yet, through which God can be known\u2014Thought\nand Extension\u2014and things that can be said of God, that is,\nadjectival, but give us no knowledge\u2014what he terms\npropria. This is explained most explicitly in Chapter VII of\nthe Short Treatise. The difference Spinoza wishes to draw\nbetween these is that although these traditional divine attributes can\nbe said of God, they do not teach us anything about what God is really\nlike. An analysis of these traditional attributes (propria)\nshows them either to be said of God when considering all of the\nattributes or to be only modes of attributes. For example, Spinoza\nclaims that when statements such as that \u201cGod is one,\u201d\n\u201ceternal\u201d and \u201cimmutable\u201d are said of God,\nthey are said \u201cin consideration of all his attributes.\u201d On\nthe other hand, something like \u201comniscience\u201d is only a\nmode of an attribute, since it is only said of God when he is\nconceived through, or considered under, the attribute of Thought. That\nis, only when God is thought of as a thinking thing, can he be said to\nbe omniscient. Similarly, when God is said to be\n\u201comnipresent,\u201d it is only when he is conceived of through\nExtension. In the Ethics though, Spinoza does away with the\ntalk of propria and does not accord them really any status as\nsuch.\n",
