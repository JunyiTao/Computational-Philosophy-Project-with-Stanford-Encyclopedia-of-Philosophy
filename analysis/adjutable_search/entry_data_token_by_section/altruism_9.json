    "main_text": "Does altruism exist? || Desire and motivation\n2.5 Desire and motivation\n\nIt is worth observing, however, that first premise of this argument is\nalso open to question.\n\nThis thesis that what motivates us to act is always a desire should be\naccepted only if we have a good understanding of what a desire is. If\na desire is simply identified with whatever internal state moves\nsomeone to act, then the claim, \u201cwhat motivates us to act is\nalways a desire\u201d, when spelled out more fully, is a tautology.\nIt says: \u201cthe internal state that moves us to act is always the\ninternal state that moves us to act\u201d. That is not a substantive\ninsight into human psychology, but a statement of identity, of the\nform \u201cA = A\u201d. We might have thought we were\nlearning something about what causes action by being told, \u201cwhat\nmotivates people is always a desire\u201d, but if\n\u201cdesire\u201d is just a term for whatever it is that motivates\nus, we are learning nothing (see Nagel 1970: 27\u201332).\n\nHere is a different way of making the same point: As the words\n\u201cdesire\u201d and \u201cwant\u201d are often used, it makes\ngood sense to say: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this, but I think I\nought to\u201d. That is the sort of remark we often make when we take\nourselves to have an unpleasant duty or obligation, or when we face a\nchallenge that we expect to be difficult and stressful. In these sorts\nof situation, we do not hunger after the goal we move towards. So, as\nthe word \u201cdesire\u201d is often used, it is simply false that\nwhat motivates us to act is always a desire. Now, the psychological\negoist who seeks an a priori defense of this doctrine might\nsay: \n\n\nwhen I claim that what motivates us to act is always a desire, I am\nnot using the word \u201cdesire\u201d as it is sometimes used. My\nusage is much broader. Among desires, in this broad sense, I include\nthe belief that one ought to do something. In fact, it includes any\ninternal state that causes someone to act. \n\n\nClearly, the thesis that what moves us is always a desire, when so\nunderstood, is empty. \n\nThe common sense terms we often use to explain why we help others do\nnot need to refer to our own desires. You are in a public space and\ncome across someone off-putting in appearance but who seems to need\nyour help. He appears to be in pain, or confused, or needy in some\nway. Recognizing this, you take yourself to have a good reason to\noffer him your assistance. You think that you ought to ask him whether\nyou can help\u2014even though that will delay you and may cause you\nsome trouble and discomfort. These ways of describing your motivation\nare all that is needed to explain why you offered him your help, and\nit is not necessary to add, \u201cI wanted to help him\u201d.\nAdmittedly, when \u201cdesire\u201d is used to designate whatever it\nis that motivates someone, it is true that you wanted to help him. But\nwhat does the explanatory work, in these cases, is your recognition of\nhis need and your judgment that therefore you ought to offer your\nhelp. Saying, \u201cI wanted to help him\u201d would be misleading,\nsince it would suggest that there was something pleasant that you\nexpected to get by offering your assistance. After you have given him\nyour help, it is true, you might think back on this encounter, and be\npleased that you had done the right thing. But you might not\u2014you\nmight be worried that what you did actually made him worse off,\ndespite your good intentions. And in any case, if you do look back\nwith pleasure at your good deed, it does not follow that feeling good\nwas your goal all along, and that you merely used him as a means to\nthat end. That would follow only if desire by its very nature is a\nform of hunger.\n",
