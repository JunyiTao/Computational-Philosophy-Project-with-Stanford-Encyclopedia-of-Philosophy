    "main_text": "Reproductive Choice || Abortion\n3.1 Abortion\n\n\nRoe v Wade (1973) granted women the right to terminate an unwanted\npregnancy, based on an implicit fundamental right to privacy. Although\nthe Supreme Court in its decision did not hold such right was\nabsolute, and argued that it must be weighted against competing state\ninterests in maternal safety and the protection of prenatal life, it\nprotected this right during the first trimester of pregnancy. In the\ndecades following Roe, its ruling has been weakened, most notably by\nrequirements of spousal and parental notification and consent, the\nenactment of \u201cwaiting periods\u201d and restrictions on the use\nof public funds. In the wake of continued social controversy as well\nas violence and harassment directed at abortion service providers, the\nnumber of doctors who are willing and able to provide such services is\ndeclining. By the mid 1990s, 85% of America's counties had no facility\noffering abortions; 2 states had only 1 provider (Rhode 1997). Many\nstates have moved to criminalize late term abortions.  \n\n\nAlthough most feminists endorse some right to abortion, the issue of\nabortion cannot easily be reduced to the interests of men versus the\ninterests of women. Women are represented on both sides of the abortion\nissue, as leaders, activists and supporters. Even among feminist\narguments in favor of abortion there are a diversity of views as to the\ngrounds that serve to justify it.\n\n\nSome arguments for permitting a right to abortion depend on denying\nrights to the fetus. Only persons have rights and fetuses, it is\nargued, are not yet persons (Tooley 1972). Yet while many arguments\nagainst abortion depend on the idea that the fetus has a right to life,\nnot all arguments supporting legal abortion reject that right. Judith\nJarvis Thomson (1971) argued that even if the fetus is a person with a\nright to life, there are limits on what the state can compel women who\ncarry fetuses in their bodies to do. If women have rights over their\nown bodies, then they have rights not to have their bodies used by\nothers against their will. The state has no right to force someone to\ndonate use of her body to another person, even if that person is in\nextreme need. (In Thomson's famous example, a person is hooked up to a\nfamous violinist, who will die if she withdraws her body's support. While it might be virtuous to remain hooked up, Thomson argues that it is not required by morality.)\nThomson's argument stresses bodily integrity and self-ownership, and\nargues that if we accept these premises we can only allow fetuses to\nuse women's bodies with women's consent. Implicit in Thomson's argument\nis also a point about gender equality: since we do not in general\ncompel people (i.e., women and men) to donate use of their\nbodies to others even in cases of extreme need, then why do we think we\nare justified in only compelling women?\n\n\nFor some feminists Thomson's analogy is not appropriate. They reject\nthe perspective of thinking of fetus and mother as distinct persons and\nemphasize their intertwined relationship. Others worry that the\nperspective of abortion as a right having to do with ownership and\ncontrol of one's body would make it difficult to question abortions\nperformed on grounds of sex selection, a practice which is becoming\nmore common around the world in countries where having girls is\ndisfavored; or abortions sought on trivial grounds like the timing of a\nvacation.\n\n\nTo view abortion only in terms of the freedom of individual choice\nor even as a clash of rights neglects a range of other relevant\nconsiderations. These include: the fact that women and only women get\npregnant and bear children, that women earn less than men, that they\nare subjected to sexual violence, have little or no access to publicly\nprovided day care, and that they have less familial or political\ndecision-making power than men. Abortion is connected to other issues\nthat need to be considered, especially the effects of unwanted\npregnancies on the lives of women and children (Sherwin 1987).\n\n\nFeminists who see a range of values at stake in abortion are more\nlikely to advocate compromise than those who hold single valued\nperspectives. Shrage (1994), for example, proposes that given the\ndiversity of values involved in the abortion controversy\n\u2014 including views of life's sanctity (Dworkin 1993) and the\nmeaning of motherhood (Luker 1984) we seek only conditional access to\nabortion \u2014 during the first trimester \u2014 and advocate policies\nthat help minimize the need for abortion, such as easily available\ncontraception.\n",
