    "main_text": "The nature of Sextus\u2019 Pyrrhonism (PH I) || What is the Skeptical ability or skill?\n3.2 What is the Skeptical ability or skill?\n\n\nScepticism is an ability to set out oppositions among things\nwhich appear and are thought of in any way at all, an ability by which,\nbecause of the equipollence in the opposed objects and accounts, we\ncome first to suspension of judgment and afterwards to\ntranquillity. (I 8)\n\nSextus tells us that the distinctively\nSkeptical ability is the one which enables its possessor to set out\noppositions of such a sort that suspension of judgment ensues\n(tranquillity, we learn later, will follow \n\u2018fortuitously\u2019\u2014see 3.3 below).\n The sort of opposition which will achieve this\nis one where \u2018none of the conflicting accounts takes precedence\nover any other as being more convincing\u2019 (I 10) (this is the\nelucidation of \u2018equipollent\u2019). So, a Skeptic is someone who\nhas the ability to find, for any given argument in favour of a\nproposition P, a conflicting argument (i.e., one whose conclusion is a\nproposition which cannot be true together with P\u2014call it P*)\nwhich is equally convincing.\n\n\nThis connects with investigation in the following way: when one\ninvestigates whether P, one assembles arguments or\nconsiderations in favour of P, and arguments or considerations\nagainst (i.e., arguments whose conclusions conflict with\nP). One assesses whether P or not-P on the basis\nof weighing up these arguments, and seeing which side carries more\nweight:\n\n \nYou pursue an inquiry insofar as you draw up\npossible solutions to the problem it addresses, consider what reasons\nmight be adduced in favour of the different solutions, and attempt to\nassess the force of those reasons in order to pick out the correct\nsolution. (Barnes 2000: xx)\n \nNote then that \u2018x suspends judgment as to whether\nP\u2019 does not merely mean that x neither\nbelieves P nor believes that not-P. For if P is a\nproposition that x has never given any thought to, then it\nmight be true that x neither believes P nor believes\nthat not-P. President Obama neither believes that my mother\u2019s\nname is \u2018Judith\u2019 nor believes that it isn\u2019t, but he is not\na skeptic about whether my mother\u2019s name is \u2018Judith\u2019. To\ncount as suspending judgment (in the Skeptic\u2019s sense) whether\nP, it is at least necessary to have given the question whether\nP some thought. As Barnes 2000: xix, puts it: \n x is sceptical with regard to the proposition\nthat P if and only if (i) x has considered whether or\nnot P, and (ii) x does not believe that P, and\n(iii) x does not believe that not-P.\n\n Note further that Sextus \n \nassembles arguments\nin favour of an affirmative answer, and arguments in favour of a\nnegative answer. The two sets of arguments exactly balance one\nanother. \n\u1f18\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae \n[suspension of judgment] supervenes\u2014\u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae \ndirected towards the\nproposition that P. (Barnes 1982: 59)\n \nThis means that\nconsidering whether or not P requires that one consider both sides\nof the question whether P, i.e., that one considers arguments in\nfavour of P and arguments in favour of not-P (or, more generally, of\nsomething incompatible with P; see PH I 10). It would\nnot be enough, for instance, to look at one argument in favour of P and\nthen reject that argument as invalid; while doing so would indeed leave\none neither believing P nor not-P (assuming one had no further evidence\neither way), one would not have considered both sides of the\nquestion, since one would not yet have considered any arguments in\nfavour of not-P. (This condition will be important later when we\nconsider the Modes of Skepticism\u2014see below, 3.5.2.)\n",
