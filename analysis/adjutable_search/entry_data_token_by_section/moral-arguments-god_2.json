    "main_text": "Arguments from Moral Knowledge or Awareness\n4. Arguments from Moral Knowledge or Awareness\n\nA variety of arguments have been developed that God is necessary to\nexplain human awareness of moral truth (or moral knowledge, if one\nbelieves that this moral awareness amounts to knowledge). Richard\nSwinburne (2004, 218), for example, argues that there is no\n\u201cgreat probability that moral awareness will occur in a Godless\nuniverse.\u201d On Swinburne\u2019s view, moral truths are either\nnecessary truths or contingent truths that are grounded in necessary\ntruths. For example, it is obviously contingent that \u201cIt is\nwrong to drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima,\u201d since it is\ncontingent that there exists a city such as Hiroshima. But one might\nhold that this proposition is true (assuming it is) because of some\nother truth such as \u201cIt is wrong intentionally to kill innocent\nhumans\u201d which does hold universally and is necessarily true.\nSwinburne does not think that an argument to God\u2019s existence\nfrom moral facts as such is powerful, increasing the likelihood of\ntheism only a little. However, the fact that we humans are aware of\nmoral facts is itself surprising and calls for an explanation.\n\nIt may be true that creatures who belong to groups that behave\naltruistically will have some survival advantage over groups that lack\nsuch a trait. However, moral beliefs are not required in order to\nproduce such behavior, since it is clear that \u201cthere are many\nspecies of animals that are naturally inclined to help others of their\nspecies, and yet do not have moral beliefs.\u201d (Swinburne 2004,\n217) If God exists, he has \u201csignificant reason to bring about\nconscious beings with moral awareness,\u201d since his intended\npurpose for humans includes making it possible for them freely to\nchoose good over evil, since this will make it possible for them to\ndevelop a relation to God. Swinburne does not think that this argument\nprovides very strong evidence for God\u2019s existence by itself, but\nrather that it provides some inductive support for belief in God. It\nis one of several phenomena which seem more probable in a theistic\nuniverse than in a godless universe. As we consider more and more such\nphenomena, it will be increasingly improbable that \u201cthey\nwill all occur.\u201d (ibid, 218) All of these\ninductive arguments together may then provide substantial support for\ntheistic belief, even if no one of them by itself would be sufficient\nfor rational belief by demonstrating that theism is likely true.\n\nSwinburne\u2019s version of the argument is quite brief and\nundeveloped, but some claims that could be used to support a more\ndeveloped version of the argument (one that will be described below)\ncan be found in a well-known and much cited article by Sharon Street\n(2006). Street\u2019s argument, as the title implies, is in no way\nintended to support a moral argument for theism. To the contrary, her\npurpose is to defend anti-realist metaethical theories against realist\ntheories that view moral truth as \u201cstance-independent\u201d of\nhuman attitudes and emotions. Street presents the moral realist with a\ndilemma posed by the question as to how our human evaluative beliefs\nare related to human evolution. It is clear, she believes, that\nevolution has strongly shaped our evaluative attitudes. The question\nconcerns how those attitudes are related to the objective evaluative\ntruths accepted by the realist. If the realist holds that there is no\nrelation between such truths and our evaluative attitudes, then this\nimplies that \u201cmost of our evaluative judgments are off track due\nto the distorting influence of Darwinian processes.\u201d The other\nalternative for the realist is to claim that there is a relationship,\nand thus that is not an accident or miracle that our evaluative\nbeliefs track the objective truths. However, this view, Street claims,\nis scientifically implausible. Street argues therefore that an\nevolutionary story about how we came to make the moral judgments we\nmake undermines confidence in the objective truth of those judgments.\nStreet\u2019s argument is of course controversial and thinkers such\nas Erik Wielenberg (2014) have argued against evolutionary debunking\narguments. Still, many regard such arguments as problematic for those\nwho want to defend moral realism, particularly when developed as a\n\u201cglobal\u201d argument (Kahane, 2010).\n\nStreet\u2019s argument has also been challenged by such critics as\nRuss Shafer-Landau (2012). However, her argument, and similar\narguments, have been acknowledged by some moral realists, such as\nDavid Enoch (2011) and Erik Wielenberg (2014) to pose a significant\nproblem for their view. Enoch, for example, even though he offers a\nresponse to Street\u2019s argument, evidently has some worries about\nthe strength of his reply. Wielenberg, to avoid the criticism that in\na non-theistic universe it would be extremely lucky if evolution\nselected for belief in objectively true moral values, proposes that\nthe natural laws that produce this result may be metaphysically\nnecessary, and thus there is no element of luck. However, many\nphilosophers will see this view of natural laws as paying a heavy\nprice to avoid theism. It might appear that Street is arguing\nstraightforwardly that evolutionary theory makes it improbable that\nhumans would have objective moral knowledge. However, it is not\nevolution by itself that predicts the improbability of objective moral\nknowledge, but the conjunction of evolution and metaphysical\nnaturalism. A good deal of the force of Street\u2019s argument stems\nfrom the assumption that naturalism is true, and therefore that the\nevolutionary process is one that is unguided. Since it is not\nevolution by itself that poses a challenge to moral realism but the\nconjunction of evolution and metaphysical naturalism, then rejecting\nnaturalism provides one way for the moral realist to solve the\nproblem. It does appear that in a naturalistic universe we would\nexpect a process of Darwinian evolution to select for a propensity for\nmoral judgments that track survival and not objective moral truths.\nMark Linville (2009, 391\u2013446) has developed a detailed argument\nfor the claim that it is difficult for metaphysical naturalists to\ndevelop a plausible evolutionary story as to how our moral judgments\ncould have epistemological warrant. However, if we suppose that the\nevolutionary process has been guided by God, who has as one of his\ngoals the creation of morally significant human creatures capable of\nenjoying a relation with God, then it would not seem at all accidental\nor even unlikely that God would ensure that humans have value beliefs\nthat are largely correct.\n\nSome philosophers believe that the randomness of Darwinian natural\nselection rules out the possibility of any kind of divine guidance\nbeing exercised through such a process. Some thinkers, including both\nsome atheists and some proponents of what is called \u201ccreation\nscience,\u201d believe that evolution and God are rivals, mutually\nexclusive hypotheses about the origins of the natural world. What can\nbe explained scientifically needs no religious explanation. However,\nthis is far from obviously true; in fact, if theism is true it is\nclearly false. From a theistic perspective to think that God and\nscience provide competing explanations fails to grasp the relationship\nbetween God and the natural world by conceiving of God as one more\ncause within that natural world. If God exists at all, God is not an\nentity within the natural world, but the creator of that natural\nworld, with all of its causal processes. If God exists, God is the\nreason why there is a natural world and the reason for the existence\nof the causal processes of the natural world. In principle, therefore,\na natural explanation can never preclude a theistic explanation. \nAny argument that natural explanations preclude or are in tension with\ntheistic explanations will in fact be theological in character, since\nthey will be grounded in assumptions about the kind of world God would\ncreate.\n\nBut what about the randomness that is a crucial part of the Darwinian\nstory? The atheist might claim that because evolutionary theory posits\nthat the process by which plants and animals have evolved is one that\ninvolves random genetic mutations, it cannot be guided, and thus God\ncannot have used evolutionary means to achieve his ends. However, this\nargument fails. It depends on an equivocation in what is meant by\n\u201crandom.\u201d When scientists claim that genetic mutations are\nrandom, they do not mean that they are uncaused, or even that they are\nunpredictable from the point of view of biochemistry, but only that\nthe mutations do not happen in response to the adaptational needs of\nthe organism. It is entirely possible for a natural process to include\nrandomness in that sense, even if the whole natural order is itself\ncreated and sustained by God. The sense of \u201crandomness\u201d\nrequired for evolutionary theory does not imply that the evolutionary\nprocess must be unguided. A God who is responsible for the laws of\nnature and the initial conditions that shape the evolutionary process\ncould certainly ensure that the process achieved certain ends.\n\nLike the other moral arguments for God\u2019s existence, the argument\nfrom moral knowledge can easily be stated in a propositional form, and\nI believe Swinburne is right to hold that the argument is best\nconstrued as a probabilistic argument that appeals to God as providing\na better explanation of moral knowledge than is possible in a\nnaturalistic universe.\n\nHumans possess\nobjective moral knowledge.\nProbably, if God does\nnot exist, humans would not possess objective moral knowledge.\nProbably, God\nexists.\n\n\nThere is a kind of argument from moral knowledge also implicit in\nAngus Ritchie\u2019s  book From Morality to\nMetaphysics: The Theistic Implications of our Ethical\nCommitments (2012). Ritchie presses a kind of\ndilemma on non-theistic accounts of morality. Subjectivist theories\nsuch as expressivism can certainly make sense of the fact that we make\nthe ethical judgments we do, but they empty morality of its objective\nauthority. Objectivist theories that take morality seriously, however,\nhave difficulty explaining our capacity to make true moral judgments,\nunless the process by which humans came to hold these capacities is\none that is controlled by a being such as God.\n\nThe moral argument from knowledge will not be convincing to anyone who\nis committed to any form of expressivism or other non-objective\nmetaethical theory, and clearly many philosophers find such views\nattractive. And there will surely be many philosophers who will judge\nthat if moral objectivism implies theism or requires theism to be\nplausible, this is a reductio of objectivist views.\nFurthermore, non-theistic moral philosophers, whether naturalists or\nnon-naturalists, have stories to tell about how moral knowledge might\nbe possible. Nevertheless, there are real questions about the\nplausibility of these stories, and thus, some of those convinced that\nmoral realism is true may judge that moral knowledge provides some\nsupport for theistic belief.\n",
