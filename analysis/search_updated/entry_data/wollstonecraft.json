    "preamble": "\n\nMary Wollstonecraft (1759\u20131797) was a moral and political\nphilosopher whose analysis of the condition of women in modern society\nretains much of its original radicalism. One of the reasons her\npronouncements on the subject remain challenging is that her\nreflections on the status of the female sex were part of an attempt to\ncome to a comprehensive understanding of human relations within a\ncivilization increasingly governed by acquisitiveness and consumption.\nHer first publication was on the education of daughters; she went on\nto write about politics, history and various aspects of philosophy in\na number of different genres that included critical reviews,\ntranslations, pamphlets, and novels. Best known for her\nVindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), her influence went\nbeyond the substantial contribution to feminism for which she is\nmostly remembered and extended to shaping the art of travel writing as\na literary genre; through her account of her journey through\nScandinavia as well as her writings on women and thoughts on the\nimagination, she had an impact on the Romantic movement.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\n\nThe second of seven children, Mary Wollstonecraft was born in\nSpitalfields, London, on 27 April 1759, in a house on Primrose Street.\nHer paternal grandfather was a successful master weaver who left a\nsizeable legacy, but her father, Edward John, mismanaged his share of\nthe inheritance. He tried to establish himself as a gentleman farmer\nin Epping. This was the first of the family\u2019s several moves, each of\nwhich marked its financial and social decline. Only Mary\u2019s brother,\nEdward (Ned), was to receive a formal education; he became a lawyer.\nHe had also inherited directly from his grandfather a substantial part\nof the latter\u2019s legacy.\n\nWollstonecraft\u2019s own somewhat haphazard education was, however, not\nentirely unusual for someone of her sex and position, nor was it\nparticularly deficient. Her published writings show her to have\nacquired a true command of the Bible and a good knowledge of the works\nof several of the most famous Ancient philosophers. The latter is\npartly explained through her personal acquaintance with Thomas Taylor,\nfamed for his translations of Plato (Tomaselli 2019). She also drew on a variety of\nearly modern sources, such as Shakespeare and Milton\u2019s works. Through\nher own writing for the Analytical Review she was to become\nwidely read in the literature of her period. Initially, the nature and\nextent of her reading was partly owed to the friendship shown to her\nin her youth by a retired clergyman and his wife. Nevertheless, as a\nwoman from an impecunious family, her prospects were very limited. In\nrelatively rapid succession, she was to enter the most likely\noccupations for someone of her sex and circumstances: a lady\u2019s\ncompanion, a schoolteacher, and a governess.\n\nIn 1778, she was engaged as a companion to a Mrs Dawson and lived at\nBath. She returned home to nurse her ailing mother in the latter part\nof 1781. After Mrs Wollstonecraft\u2019s death, in the spring of 1782, Mary\nlived with the Bloods, the impoverished family of her dearest friend,\nFanny. In the winter of 1783, Mary left them in order to attend to her\nsister Eliza and her newly born daughter. There followed the first of\nthe emotionally very difficult episodes in Mary\u2019s life. What prompted\nMary to intervene as decisively as she did in her sister\u2019s marriage\nremains somewhat of a mystery; but in the course of January 1784, Mary\ntook her sister away, and the two women went into hiding, leaving\nEliza\u2019s infant daughter behind; the baby died the following\nAugust.\n\nBy February of that year, the two sisters had already been planning to\nestablish a school with Fanny Blood. Mary\u2019s other sister, Everina,\njoined in the project a little later. They first set their sights on\nIslington, then moved to Newington Green, where Mary met the moral and\npolitical thinker, the Reverend Richard Price, head of Newington\u2019s\nthriving Dissenting community, and heard him preach. This was a\ncrucial encounter for Mary. Several years later, she was to rise to\nhis defence in a Vindication of the Rights of Men\n(1790), and it was through her connections to members of this\ncommunity that she was to gain an introduction to her future\npublisher, friend, and one might even say, patron, Joseph Johnson.\n\nIn November 1785, Wollstonecraft set off on a trip to Lisbon, where\nher friend Fanny, who had married that February, was expecting her\nfirst child. On board the ship, Mary met a man suffering from\nconsumption; she nursed him for a fortnight, the length of the\njourney. This experience is related in her first novel, Mary, a\nFiction (1788). She gained a very unfavourable opinion of\nPortuguese life and society, which seemed to her ruled by\nirrationality and superstitions. Mary\u2019s brief stay in Portugal was,\nfurthermore, to be a profoundly unhappy one, for both Fanny and her\nbaby died shortly after the delivery.\n\nOn her return to England, Wollstonecraft found her school in a dire\nstate. Far from providing her with a reliable income and some\nstability, it was to be a source of endless worries and a financial\ndrain. Only Joseph Johnson\u2019s advance on her first\nbook, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters: with Reflections on\nFemale Conduct in the more important Duties of Life (1787) helped\nease her considerable financial difficulties. It consists of brief\ndiscussions on such topics as \u2018Moral Discipline\u2019,\n\u2018Artificial Manners\u2019, \u2018Boardings-Schools\u2019,\n\u2018The Benefits Which Arise From Disappointments\u2019,\n\u2018The Observance of Sunday\u2019, and \u2018On the Treatment of\nServants\u2019. Although it might seem somewhat cursory, this book\nserved as the groundwork for many of the topics to which she would\nreturn in her more famous works of the 1790s.\n\nFollowing the collapse of her school, Wollstonecraft became a\ngoverness to the family of Lord Kingsborough for a brief and\nunsatisfactory period. The position took her to Ireland, where she\ncompleted Mary, A Fiction. On her return to London, Joseph\nJohnson came to the rescue once again by giving her some literary\nemployment. In 1787, she also began, but never completed, The Cave\nof Fancy. A Tale. The same year, she wrote Original Stories\nfrom Real Life; with Conversations, calculated to Regulate the\nAffections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness (1788); it\nappeared in two other London editions in her life time (1791 and\n1796), the last of which illustrated by William Blake.\nWollstonecraft\u2019s anthology, The Female Reader; Miscellaneous\nPieces in Prose and Verse; Selected from the Best Writers and Disposed\nunder Proper Heads; for the Improvement of Young Women (1789),\nwas compiled in the same period and published under the name of\n\u2018Mr. Cresswick, teacher of Elocution\u2019; it pursues themes\nto be found in her previous works and contains excerpts mostly from\nthe Bible and Shakespeare\u2019s plays, as well as many by various\neighteenth-century authors, such as Voltaire, Hume, Steele, Charlotte\nSmith, and Madame de Genlis.\n\nTo understand the extent to which Wollstonecraft made up for the lack\nof a formal education, it is essential to appreciate fully that her\ntalents were to extend to translating and reviewing, and that these\ntwo activities, quite apart from her own intellectual curiosity,\nacquainted her with a great many authors, including Leibniz and Kant.\nShe translated into English Jacques Necker\u2019s Of the Importance of\nReligious Opinions (1788) from French, Rev. C. G. Salzmann\u2019s \nElements of Morality, for the Use of Children; with an Introductory\nAddress to Parents (1790) from German, and Madame de Cambon\u2019s\nYoung Grandison (1790) from Dutch. In each case, the texts\nshe produced were almost as if her own, not just because she was in\nagreement with their original authors, but because she more or less\nre-wrote them. The Reverend Salzmann is unlikely to have resented her\nfor this, as he was to translate into German both A Vindication of\nthe Rights of Woman and William Godwin\u2019s Memoirs of the\nAuthor of a Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798).\n\nThroughout the period covered by these translations Wollstonecraft\nwrote for the Analytical Review, which her publisher, Joseph\nJohnson, together with Thomas Christie, started in May 1788. She was\ninvolved with this publication either as a reviewer or as editorial\nassistant for most of its relatively short life. Despite her own\npractice of the genre, her many reviews reveal the degree to which,\nshe, like many other moralists in the eighteenth century, feared the\nmoral consequences of reading novels. She believed that even those of\na relatively superior quality encouraged vanity and selfishness. She\nwas to concede, however, that reading such works might nonetheless be\nbetter than not reading at all. Besides novels, Wollstonecraft\nreviewed poetry, travel accounts, educational works, collected\nsermons, biographies, natural histories, and essays and treatises on\nsubjects such as Shakespeare, happiness, theology, music, architecture\nand the awfulness of solitary confinement; the authors whose works she\ncommented on included Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Emanuel Swedenborg, Lord\nKames, Rousseau, and William Smellie. Until the end of 1789, her\narticles were mostly of a moral and aesthetic nature. However, in\nDecember 1789, she reviewed a speech by her old friend, Richard Price,\nentitled A Discourse on the Love of our Country, delivered on Nov.\n4, 1789, at the Meeting-House in the Old Jewry, to the Society for\nCommemorating the Revolution of Great Britain. With an Appendix,\ncontaining the report of the Committee of the Society; and Account of\nthe Population of France; and the Declarations of the Rights by the\nNational Assembly of France (1789). This address to the\nRevolution Society in commemoration of the events of 1688 partly\nprompted Burke to compose his famous Reflections on the\nRevolution in France, and on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in\nLondon Relative to that Event (1790).\n\nBurke\u2019s attack on Price in that work in turn led Wollstonecraft, egged\non by her publisher, Johnson, to take up her pen in the aged\nReverend\u2019s defence. A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790)\nwas almost certainly the first of many responses Burke\u2019s\nReflections elicited. Initially published\nanonymously at the end of November, the second edition that quickly\nfollowed in mid-December bore its author\u2019s name and marked a turning\npoint in her career; it established her as a political writer. In\nSeptember 1791, Wollstonecraft began A Vindication of the Rights\nof Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects, which\nelaborated a number of points made in the previous\nVindication, namely, that in most cases, marriage was nothing\nbut a property relation, and that the education women received ensured\nthat they could not meet the expectations society had of them and\nalmost certainly guaranteed them an unhappy life.\n\nFollowing the publication of her second Vindication,\nWollstonecraft was introduced to the French statesman and diplomat,\nCharles Talleyrand, on his mission to London on the part of the\nConstituent Assembly in February 1792. She dedicated the second\nedition of the A Vindication of the Rights of Woman to him.\nIn December 1792, she travelled to France where she met Gilbert Imlay,\nan American merchant and author of A Topographical Descriptions of\nthe Western Territory of North America (1792) and The\nEmigrants (1793). As British subjects were increasingly at risk\nunder the Terror, Wollstonecraft passed as Imlay\u2019s wife so as to\nbenefit from the security enjoyed at the time by American citizens.\nThey never married. Imlay was probably the source of Wollstonecraft\u2019s\ngreatest unhappiness, first through his lack of ardour for her, then\nbecause of his infidelity, and finally because of his complete\nrejection of her. Most of all, her love of Imlay brought\nWollstonecraft to the realisation that the passions are not so easily\nbrought to heel by reason.\n\nWollstonecraft had a girl by Imlay. She was born at Le Havre in May\n1794 and named Fanny, after Wollstonecraft\u2019s friend, Fanny Blood. A\nyear after Fanny\u2019s birth, Wollstonecraft twice attempted suicide,\nfirst in May, then in October 1795. She broke with Imlay finally in\nMarch 1796. In April of the same year, she renewed her acquaintance\nwith William Godwin and they became lovers that summer. They were\nmarried at St Pancras church in March 1797. On the 30th\nAugust, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, future author of\nFrankenstein and wife of Shelley, was born.\n2. Pedagogical Writings\n\nApart from Mary, a Fiction and The Cave of Fancy\nWollstonecraft\u2019s early writings were of a pedagogical nature (Jones 2020). These\nreveal the profound influence John Locke had on Wollstonecraft\u2019s\nthought, and several of the arguments of his Some Thoughts\nConcerning Education (1693) are echoed in Wollstonecraft\u2019s\nconception of morality and the best manner to inculcate it in\nindividuals at the earliest possible age. The opening paragraph of her\nThoughts on the Education of Daughters speaks of the duty\nparents have to ensure that \u2018reason should cultivate and govern\nthose instincts which are implanted in us to render the path of duty\npleasant\u2014for if they are not governed they will run wild; and\nstrengthen the passions which are ever endeavouring to obtain\ndominion\u2014I mean vanity and self-love.\u2019 Similarly, the\nbeginning of her Original Stories from Real Life stated its\nauthor\u2019s intent, namely to seek \u2018to cure those faults by reason,\nwhich ought never to have taken root in the infant mind. Good habits,\nimperceptibly fixed, are however far preferable to the precepts of reason; but\nas this task requires more judgement than generally falls to the lot\nof parents, substitutes must be sought for, and medicines given, when\nregimen would have answered the purpose better\u2019.\nWollstonecraft\u2019s prescriptions to counter the deplorable education she\nthought her contemporaries were inflicting on their children takes the\nform of a tale about two girls, Mary and Caroline. At the beginning of\nthe story, the reader finds the girls left to the management of\nignorant servants (one of Locke\u2019s great bugbears), but they are\neventually placed under the tuition of a woman of tenderness and\ndiscernment. The book shows how the latter succeeds in teaching\ncontemptuous Mary and vain Caroline to avoid anger, exercise\ncompassion, love truth and virtue, and respect the whole of God\u2019s\ncreation.  It is important to note however that whilst Locke advocated home education to shield boys from the bad influences to which they might be subject at school, Wollstonecraft was mostly inclined to think the opposite on the grounds that children needed to be with persons of their own age.  In an ideal world, boys and girls would be educated together in schools. Many of these concerns would appear again in her Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792): indeed Sandrine Berg\u00e8s reads this work primarily as a treatise on education (Berg\u00e8s 2013).\n\nThat reason must rule supreme could easily appear to be a running theme of Wollstonecraft\u2019s\nworks written prior to her sojourn in Revolutionary France and, all\nthe more, prior to her travels through Scandinavia. It is stressed in\nher Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Other\ncontinuities between her Thoughts on the Education of\nDaughters and the Vindication include her insistence that girls and\nyoung women be made to acquire \u2018inner resources\u2019 so as to\nmake them as psychologically independent as possible. The\nThoughts also reveals Wollstonecraft\u2019s conviction that\nuniversal benevolence is the first virtue, as well as her faith in a\nprovidentially ordained universe. She enjoined her readers to prepare\ntheir children for \u2018the main business of our lives\u2019,\nthat is, the acquisition of virtue, and, unsurprisingly given her own\nhistory, she urged parents to strengthen their children\u2019s characters\nso as to enhance their capacity to survive personal tragedies.\nSelf-mastery was thus the aim of education and it was the duty of\nparents to ensure that their children received it.  However, she insisted that there was a time for everything, including for the development of each of the mind\u2019s faculties, not least the imagination.  Ultimately, she wanted children and young people to educated in such a way as to have well balanced minds in strong and healthy bodies. That mind and body\nneeded to be exercised and prepared to face the inevitable hardships of life is\nthe fundamental point of her of her pedagogical works (Tomaselli 2020).\n3. Moral and Political Writings\n\nWhen Wollstonecraft began to engage in political commentary in\nreviewing Price\u2019s A Discourse on the Love of our Country, she\npraised him for his account of true patriotism as \u2018the result of\nreason, not the undirected impulse of nature, ever tending to selfish\nextremes\u2019 as well as his defence of Christianity\u2019s prescription\nof universal benevolence against those who argued that such sentiments were\nincompatible with the love of one\u2019s country. She endorsed his view of\nliberty of conscience as a sacred right and wrote sympathetically\nabout his plea for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, which\nimposed civil disabilities on Dissenters. She also seemed to support\nhis claim that the political Settlement of 1689 was wanting in that it\ndid not make for full representation of the people and hence made only\nfor partial liberty. Finally, Wollstonecraft reproduced the passage in\nwhich Price linked the American and French revolutions and clamoured\nfor the end of despotism throughout Europe.\n\nWhen not so long thereafter she came to write her Vindication of\nthe Rights of Men (1790), Wollstonecraft attacked Edmund Burke\nfor having set upon an harmless elderly preacher in his\nReflections; yet her own review justifies Burke\u2019s depiction\nof Price\u2019s sermon as inflammatory. Far from thinking that the events\ntaking place in France gave grounds for rejoicing, Burke feared their\nconsequences from the very start. The National Assembly\u2019s confiscation\nof the Church\u2019s property, he predicted, would lead to further\nconfiscations, undermine the fundamental right to property, and result\nin anarchy, which only the rise of a charismatic, authoritarian figure could bring to\nan end.\n\nOf the disagreements between Price and Wollstonecraft, on the one\nhand, and Burke, on the other, one of the deepest was over their\nrespective view of the nature of civil society and of political power\nin general. The two friends believed that government, the rule of law,\nand all human relations could be simplified, explicated, and rendered\ntransparent, and both were convinced that this was the task ahead for\nall lovers of liberty. For Burke, on the contrary, civil society\nconsisted of countless ineffable links between individuals. The\nlatter\u2019s relationship to authority was for the most part no less\nineffable; moreover, he believed sound political judgement to be the\nproduct of experience, and he cautioned prudence. To sweep away\nestablished practices and institutions and think of politics as a mere\nmatter of administrating in accordance with a set of abstract rules or\nrights uninformed by the customs and culture, and hence the national\ncharacter, of a people was, in his view, to demonstrate a crass\ndisregard for the most obvious facts of human nature and history (Conniff 1999).\nBurke\u2019s argument led him to dwell on France\u2019s financial position in\nsome detail, and he defended its royal family and its Church; he\ninsisted, moreover, that it was already benefiting from a policy of\ngradual reform. The overall effect Burke sought to achieve was to depict\nhis opponent as theoretically confused, politically naive, generally\nmisinformed; and to show, most damnably of all, that Price\u2019s sermon on the Love of\nour Country, with all its affirmation of feelings for humanity,\nproved him to be unpatriotic.\n\nWollstonecraft\u2019s Vindication was the first of many replies.\nAmongst those that followed was one by Catharine Macaulay, who had\ninfluenced Wollstonecraft\u2019s pedagogy and was much admired by her (Gunther-Canada 1998; Coffee, 2019). Wollstonecraft\u2019s riposte is an interesting and rhetorically powerful\nwork in its own right as well as a necessary introduction to the\nVindication of the Rights of Woman. It consists mostly of a\nsustained attack on Burke rather than a defence of the rights of man.\nThis is partly because Wollstonecraft took for granted a Lockean\nconception of God-given rights discoverable by reason, except when the\nlatter was warped by self-love. Wollstonecraft further believed that\nGod made all things right and that the cause of all evil was man. In\nher view, Burke\u2019s Reflections showed its author to be blind\nto man-made poverty and injustice; this she attributed to his\ninfatuation with rank, Queen Marie-Antoinette, and the English\nConstitution. Demonstrating her familiarity with Burke\u2019s other works\nand speeches, especially A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin\nof our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757) and the\nSpeech on Conciliation with America (1775), she also argued\nthat he was inconsistent, if only because of the impossibility, as she\nsaw it, of reconciling his sympathy for the American cause with his\nreaction to events in France. In this, Wollstonecraft was far from\nalone and many who had followed Burke\u2019s parliamentary career and heard\nhis Speeches to the House of Commons were astonished by what they\nthought was a radical and inexplicable change of position.\n\nAs she was to do in her next and more famous Vindication,\nWollstonecraft did not simply clamour for rights, but emphasised that\nthese entail duties; but she also insisted that none could be expected\nto perform duties whose natural rights were not respected. Furthermore\nshe used David Hume\u2019s History of England (1754\u201362) to\ncontend that England\u2019s laws were the product of historical contingency\nand insisted that only those institutions that could withstand the\nscrutiny of reason and be shown to be in conformity with natural\nrights and God\u2019s justice merited respect and obedience. There was no\nquestion of blanket reverence for the past and its juridical legacy.\nAs for civilization, she thought its progress very uneven and\ndismissed the culture of politeness and polish as nothing but a screen\nbehind which hypocrisy, egotism and greed festered unchecked. Finally,\nopposing nature and reason to artifice and politeness, she made\nherself the true patriot and Burke the fickle Francophile. She was the\nclear-headed independent thinker, he the emotive creature of a system\nof patronage. She exhibited manly virtues, he effeminacy; although Mary Fairclough argues that, in truth, there was much in common between each thinker\u2019s treatment of feelings and instincts (Fairclough 2020).\n\nIn the midst of her tirade she turned, rather unexpectedly, to the\nsubject of family life and the limits of parental authority,\nespecially in relation to arranged marriages (Tomaselli 2001). She condemned marriages\nof convenience together with late marriages: both fostered immorality\nin her view. Indeed, from her perspective, nearly every aspect of the\nprevailing culture had that consequence, for, in bringing girls up to\nbe nothing but empty headed playthings, parents made for a morally\nbankrupt society. Such beings could never make dutiful mothers, as\nthey took the horizon to be the eyes of the men they flirted with. The\nmoral depravity of a society devoted to the acquisition of property\nand its conspicuous display rather than to the pursuit of reason and\nthe protection of natural rights found the means of its reproduction\nin the family, she contended. Here her dispute was not just with\nBurke, but implicitly also with Price (Jones, 2005). In his sermon, he had deplored\nthe sexual depravity of the times that he saw embodied even in those\nhe considered patriots. But to seek only to vindicate the rights of\nmen, as Price had done, was insufficient and misconceived, according\nto Wollstonecraft. If one sought a truly moral society, the family had\nto change, and this, in turn, required a complete transformation in the\nnature of the relationship between men and women before, and within,\nmarriage (Botting 2006). Only a sound upbringing of both the sexes could secure that.\nThis was the nub of her attack on political theorists and\neducationalists alike.\n\nWhen Wollstonecraft came to write The Vindication of the Rights of\nWoman, which she did within a matter of months following the\npublication of her first overtly political work, the moral\nrejuvenation of society and the happiness of individual women were\nwoven together. Women were ill-prepared for their duties as social\nbeings and imprisoned in a web of false expectations that would\ninevitably make them miserable. She wanted women to become\nrational and independent beings whose sense of worth came, not\nfrom their appearance, but from their inner perception of self-command\nand knowledge. Women had to be educated; their minds and bodies had to\nbe trained. This would make them good companions, wives, mothers and\ncitizens (Brace 2000). Above all it would make them fully human, that is, beings\nruled by reason and characterised by self-command. Besides criticisms\nof existing pedagogical practices and theories, most notably\nRousseau\u2019s Emile (1762), the Vindication contains\nmany social and political proposals which range from a detailed\noutline of necessary changes in school curriculum to the suggestion\nthat women be granted not only civil and political rights, but have\nelected representatives of their own. It argues that women should be\ntaught skills so as to be able to support themselves and their\nchildren in widowhood, and never have to marry or remarry out of\nfinancial necessity. It seeks to reclaim midwifery for women, against\nthe encroachment of men into this profession, and contends that women\ncould be physicians just as well as nurses. It urges women to extend\ntheir interests to encompass politics and the concerns of the whole of\nhumanity. It also contains advice on how to make marriages last. In\nWollstonecraft\u2019s view, marriages ought to have friendship rather than\nphysical attraction as their basis (Kendrick 2019). Husbands and wives ought not,\nmoreover, to be overly intimate and should maintain a degree of\nreserve towards each other.  This said, she thought sex should be based on genuine mutual physical desire.\n\nWollstonecraft wanted women to aspire to full citizenship, to be\nworthy of it, and this necessitated the development of reason.\nRational women would perceive their real duties. They would forgo the\nworld of mere appearances, the world of insatiable needs on which\neighteenth-century society was based, as Adam Smith had explained more\nlucidly than anyone, and of which France was the embodiment, in\nWollstonecraft\u2019s conception (Leddy 2016).\n\nThat she embraced the social and economic consequences of her vision\nof happy marriages, based on friendship and producing the next moral\ngeneration was spelled out further in her subsequent work, An\nHistorical and Moral View of the Origin and Progress of the French\nRevolution; and the Effect It Has Produced in Europe (1794). In\nthat work, she endeavoured, amongst other things, to assess the merits\nand demerits of the progress of humanity and establish the causes of\nFrench despotism. The picture she drew of ancien\nr\u00e9gime France was of a country ruled by superstition,\nand morally and politically degenerate. Borrowing from Smith, whose\nTheory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and Inquiry into the\nNature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) she had drawn\non previously, she sketched a possible future society in which the\ndivision of labour would be kept to a minimum and the sexes would be\nnot only educated together but encouraged to work in family units.\nSingle sex institutions and, for instance, all-male workshops\nencouraged lasciviousness in her view. She thus looked forward to a\nsociety in which small businesses and farms would provide basic,\ninstead of superfluous, needs.\n\nThe combination of her experience of her unrequited love for\nImlay, the dictates of her own emotions, and the tribulations of a\ntrip in Northern Europe led her to reconsider her view of the power of reason.\nIndeed, she was also to review her opinion of France, polite culture and\nmanners, even Catholicism which she had abhorred, a loathing that her\nstay in Portugal had done much to strengthen. The Letters Written\nDuring A Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark (1796),\nwhose influence on travel literature as well as the Romantic movement\nis by no means negligible, show Wollstonecraft to have begun to\nespouse an increasingly nuanced view of the world, and to have sought to\ndevelop an even more fluid account of the relationship between reason, the imagination, and the\npassions, as well as of modernity. Thus she grew a little closer to\nBurke in that she came to think that the tyranny of commercial wealth\nmight be worse than that of rank and privilege. Whilst in France, she\nhad already begun to write less critically of the English system of\ngovernment. She had witnessed the Terror, fallen in love, born a child\nout of wedlock, been rejected, and attempted suicide. A second suicide\nattempt lay ahead. So did the prospect of happiness with William\nGodwin, a prospect cut short by her death in childbirth. Posthumous\nnotoriety was to follow as Wollstonecraft became identified only with\nthe Vindication of the Rights of Woman and that work was\nironically, in turn, equated with a flouting of social conventions,\nprincipally in relation to marriage.\n4. Reputation\n\nAlthough she was very much encouraged by her publisher, Joseph\nJohnson, she received little support from fellow intellectuals in her\nlifetime. Even Godwin did not take to her on their first meeting. Relatively few of the foremost women writers gave Wollstonecraft their\nwholehearted support in the eighteenth century. She received some encouragement for her first publications from Catharine Macaulay, but the latter unfortunately died in 1791, before Wollstonecraft\u2019s career reached its peak. Some mocked her, but rarely were her ideas genuinely assessed in the way they have come to be since the second half of the twentieth century. The\nleading poet, Anna Barbauld (1743\u20131825) was one of the few members of the radical intelligentsia of the time whose opposition to Wollstonecraft was the product of a real engagement with her views on women. By the end of the 1790s and for most of the nineteenth century, Wollstonecraft was derided by many, if only because of what was deemed to have been a scandalous personal life. There were, to be sure, important exceptions, especially in America (Botting and Carey 2004). But such praise as she did receive on both sides of the Atlantic came from arguably limited acquaintance with her ideas or her intellectual persona.\n\nThus it seemed that from the end of the eighteenth century and throughout the\nnext, she, who had endeavoured to place marriage on a solid foundation\nby providing an account of the education that would prepare spouses\nfor it, would be thought of as someone who had sought to pass\nas married when she wasn\u2019t and as the mother of an illegitimate child.\nMuch of this reputation was owed to Godwin\u2019s frank, arguably\nunnecessarily frank, account of Wollstonecraft\u2019s life, in Memoirs\nof the Author of a \u2018Vindication of the Rights of\nWoman\u2019 (1798). It revealed, amongst other personal details,\nher relationship with Imlay and thereby cast a deep shadow over her\nreputation. In any event, John Stuart Mill\u2019s Subjection of\nWomen (1869) was to eclipse most other contributions to feminist\ndebates of the period.\n\nIn the twentieth century, and especially following the growth of\nfeminism in the Anglo-Saxon world in the 1960s, scholars disregarded\nthe vicissitudes of Wollstonecraft\u2019s private life and heralded her as\nthe first English feminist. She came to be read principally within the\ncontext of the history of the women\u2019s movement. Since the last decades\nof the twentieth century, however, a growing number of commentators\nhave looked at A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in its\nhistorical and intellectual context rather than in isolation or in\nrelation to subsequent feminist theories. This has led to renewed\ninterest in her other political writings, including her Letters\nWritten During A Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.\nWollstonecraft has now long ceased to be seen as just a scandalous\nliterary figure, or just the embodiment of a nascent feminism which\nonly reached maturity two hundred years later, but as an Enlightenment\nmoral and political thinker whose works present a self-contained\nargument about the kind of change society would need to undergo for\nmen and women to be virtuous in both the private and the public sphere\nand thereby secure the chance of a measure of happiness.\n\nWhat is more, with growing interest in reception history, the extent\nof her influence in Europe and beyond as been the subject of\nreassessments. It is becoming increasingly evident that\nWollstonecraft was widely read and respected as a pioneer of woman\u2019s\nrights around the world, especially in America, continental Europe, and Brazil (Botting 2013). She was translated into several languages, in the 1790s and throughout the nineteenth century (Johns 2020).\n\nEfforts to place Wollstonecraft\u2019s thought within an international, and specifically an imperial, context have focused on her use of abolitionist discourses, or what Laura Brace (2016) calls the \u2018social imaginary\u2019 of anti-slavery, to criticize British society. Moira Ferguson (1994) places Wollstonecraft in dialogue with nineteenth-century representations of sexual exploitation within the colonial context by such women authors as Jane Austen and Jamaica Kincaid.\n\nWollstonecraft\u2019s reference to slavery and the slave trade as \u201can atrocious\ninsult to humanity\u201d in Vindication of the Rights of\nMen, and her call for social justice more generally, has been\nnoted by Amartya Sen in his The Idea of Justice (2009). Often\nseen as a proponent of liberal values (Sapiro 1992), Wollstonecraft\ncontinues also to placed within a republican tradition, most recently\nby Sandrine Berg\u00e8s (2013), Alan Coffee (2014), and Lena Halldenius\n(2015), who have analysed her view of freedom in terms of independence\nand the absence of subordination to the arbitrary power of others.\n\nIn recent years, scholars have also made use of Wollstonecraft to inform modern feminist discussions, especially those regarding autonomy, education, and nature. Catriona Mackenzie (2016) argues that Wollstonecraft\u2019s understanding of freedom as independence is a forebear to feminist theories that emphasise female autonomy. Sandrine Berg\u00e8s has compared Wollstonecraft\u2019s model of education to modern \u2018capabilities\u2019 approaches that favour grassroots educational programmes. Barbara Seeber (2016) places Wollstonecraft within the tradition of ecofeminism: she argues that Wollstonecraft linked social hierarchies with the domination of nature by human beings. Sandrine Berg\u00e8s (2016) identifies a contradiction in her position on feminist motherhood that remains relevant for feminism today.\n\nTwenty-first century studies have displayed new interest in the philosophical and theological underpinnings of Wollstonecraft\u2019s work. Isabelle Bour (2019) has charted her engagement with competing epistemological models in the 1790s, while Sylvana Tomaselli (2016; 2019) asserts that Wollstonecraft engaged closely with the aesthetic theories of Immanuel Kant and Edmund Burke, as well as Plato\u2019s theory of knowledge, Emily Dumler-Winckler (2019) argues that Wollstonecraft appropriated and sometimes subverted a set of conceptual tools from theology in order to make her arguments for women\u2019s equality. Wollstonecraft\u2019s complex relationship with the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau has been investigated by Christopher Brooke (2019).\n\nWhether Wollstonecraft is best seen as belonging to one tradition or\nany other will remain a matter of dispute. What is important to\nremember is that she responded to a fast changing political situation\nand that she continued to engage critically with public opinion, the\nleading intellectual and political figures of her age, and most\nremarkably, her own views in the light of her experiences in France,\nNorthern Europe and Great Britain. Her critique of Burke, the English\npolitical system, even the aristocracy, became more muted as she found\nthe continued expansion of commerce and growth of the luxury economy\nto lead to even greater inequities than the world it was\nreplacing.\n",
