    "main_text": "The Doctrine of Suspension\n10. Compatibilism or Incompatibilism?\nCompatibilism is the thesis that free will is compatible with\ncausal determinism, and incompatibilism is the thesis that free will\nis incompatible with causal determinism. Is Locke a compatibilist or\nan incompatibilist?\nThe fact that Locke thinks that freedom of action is compatible\nwith the will\u2019s being determined by uneasiness might immediately\nsuggest that Locke is a compatibilist. But, as we have seen\n(Section 8 above), it is illegitimate to infer\ncompatibility with causal determinism from compatibility with\ndetermination of the will by uneasiness. Still, the evidence strongly\nsuggests that Locke would have embraced compatibilism, if the issue\nhad been put to him directly. Freedom of action, on Locke\u2019s\naccount, is a matter of being able to do what one wills and being able\nto forbear what one wills to forbear. Although we sometimes act under\nnecessity (compulsion or restraint\u2014E1\u20135 II.xxi.13: 240), the\nmere fact (if it is a fact) that our actions are determined by the\nlaws of nature and antecedent events does not threaten our freedom\nwith respect to their performance. As Locke makes clear, if the door\nto my room is unlocked, I am free with respect to the act of leaving\nthe room, because I have the ability to stay or leave as I will. It is\nonly when the door is locked, or when I am chained, or when my path is\nblocked, or something else deprives me of the ability to stay or\nleave, that I am unfree with respect to the act of leaving.\nDeterminism by itself represents no threat to our freedom of\naction. In this respect, Locke is a forerunner of many other\ncompatibilist theories of freedom, including, for example, those of\nG.E. Moore (1912) and A.J. Ayer (1954). (For a contrary view, see\nSchouls 1992: 121. And for a response to Schouls 1992, see Davidson\n2003: 213 ff.)\n",
