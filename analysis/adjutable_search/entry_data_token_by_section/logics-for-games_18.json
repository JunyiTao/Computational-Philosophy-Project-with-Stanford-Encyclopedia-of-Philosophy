    "main_text": "The Nature of Players || Preference and Equilibria\n3.1 Preference and Equilibria\n\nGame trees and game matrices specify the moves available to players at\ndifferent moments in time. They also indicate all possible outcomes,\neither as cells in a matrix, or as leaf nodes in an extensive game.\nHowever, to study what players should or will do in\na game, a further component is needed: players\u2019 preferences.\nSuch preferences need not only reflect material pay-offs or other\nfeatures of outcome states. Rather, they may also relate to the\nprocess of play itself, and which moves lead to a certain outcome.\nMoreover, preferences may contain irreducibly subjective elements.\nEven when assuming the same role in a game, different players may\ndisagree about the relative desirability of certain outcomes (Fehr\n& Schmidt 1999).\n\nWithin a static, outcome-oriented perspective on games, a major\nemphasis is on equilibria: strategy combinations where all players do\nthe best they can in light of their preferences and the\nopponents\u2019 strategies. A further, dynamic perspective focuses on\nhow such equilibria relate to the individual players\u2019 stepwise\nlocal reasoning on how to act in light of their beliefs and desires.\nThis perspective is taken up in\n Section 4.\n",
