    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness || Nonexistence Does Not Hold the Key\n5.6 Nonexistence Does Not Hold the Key\n\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\) is very remote from MOT\\(^o\\). Recall that,\naccording to MOT\\(^o\\), the object called \u201cthe golden\nmountain\u201d is not an abstract object but something as concrete as\nevery existent mountain in the world. Secondly, and related to this,\nthe idea that some objects do not exist is one of the cornerstones of\nMOT\\(^o\\)\u2014but it is not an essential feature of\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\), i.e., it doesn\u2019t play an essential role within\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\). Within MOT\\(^{dc}\\), Meinongian objects are\ndefined as a particular kind of abstract objects (namely abstract\nobjects to which two kinds of predicates apply). Of course, one can\ndecide to say that these objects are \u201cnonexistent\u201d; but\nnothing hinges upon this decision. According to MOT\\(^o\\), the\nonly difference between Meinongian objects and normal objects consists\nin the alleged nonexistence of the former. However, in\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\), Meinongian objects are distinct from normal objects\nbecause only the former are abstract objects which encode properties.\nThis suffices to distinguish Meinongian objects from normal objects.\nThus, there is no need to assume that existence is a property of\nindividuals and that there is a difference between \u201cThere are\nobjects that are such-and-such\u201d and \u201cObjects that are\nsuch-and-such exist\u201d.\n\nIf MOT\\(^{dc}\\) is essentially different from MOT\\(^o\\), the\nquestion arises to what extent MOT\\(^{dc}\\) can fulfill the tasks\nMOT\\(^o\\) was supposed to fulfill. It seems that\nMOT\\(^{dc}\\) cannot do everything MOT\\(^o\\) was\nsupposed to do. First, consider the problem of intentionality: if\nsomebody fears the devil, does he fear an abstract object? \u2014\nThis seems to be psychologically impossible, for an abstract object\ncannot do any harm to\n anybody.[38]\n Second, recall the problem of negative singular existence sentences:\nAstronomers claim that Vulcan does not exist. Do they thereby intend\nto deny the existence of an abstract object that only encodes being\nsuch-and-such a planet? \u2014 Probably not. They rather deny the\nexistence of something that is a planet, i.e., a concrete\nmaterial thing. Finally, consider the problem of discourse about the\npast and the future: when a teacher in a history of philosophy class\ntalks about Socrates, does she then intend to talk about an abstract\nobject that only encodes all of the properties that Socrates (the\n\u201creal\u201d one) once exemplified? \u2014 Presumably not. If\nthere is an object which she is intentionally directed at, then it is\nprobably the \u201creal\u201d Socrates, not its abstract\ncounterpart.\n\nIt may be that proponents of MOT\\(^{dc}\\) find ways to meet these\nobjections such that their theories provide solutions for the problem\nof intentionality, the problem of singular existence sentences, and\nthe problem of reference to past and future objects. But even if they\ndon\u2019t, it is beyound doubt that Neo-Meinongian theories can be\nand indeed are fruitful in many ways. In particular, they provide the\nbasis for a consistent realist ontology of fictitious objects. (For a\nvariety of further applications see in particular the writings of\nJacquette, Parsons, and Zalta.)\n",
