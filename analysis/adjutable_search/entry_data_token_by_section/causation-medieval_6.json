    "main_text": "Causality, Knowledge and Necessity || Causality and Necessity\n4.1 Causality and Necessity\n\n\nMedieval thinkers believed that the world was created by God, and so\na question like \u201cIs proposition P contingent?\u201d were seen as equivalent\nto the question \u201cCould God have created a world in which P does not\nhold?\u201d. So our question can be reduced to one about divine power.\n\n\nA very common theme in medieval thought is the distinction between\nGod\u2019s absolute and ordered, or ordained, power (potentia\nabsoluta and potentia ordinata). This distinction goes\nback to early medieval thought (Moonan 1994), and was extensively used\nin later medieval philosophy (Courtenay 1971; Adams 1987, pp.\n1186ff.).\n\n\nGod\u2019s absolute power is unrestricted power. According to this power,\nGod can create a huge variety of possible worlds. One frequently used\nprinciple is this: given two distinct entities, God can create a world\nin which one of them, but not the other, exists, or, in this\nworld, God can destroy one of them, leaving the other intact. We should\nnote that this is not exactly innocuous; ontologically, it amounts to\nsome sort of logical atomism. See (White 1990b).\n\n\nBut God will, in practice, not exercise absolute power: as Aquinas\nputs it, \u201cwhat is attributed to the divine power insofar as the command\nof a just will executes it, God is said to be able to do with respect\nto His ordered power\u201d. (Aquinas, Summa theologiae I, qu. 25,\na. 5, ad 1) So there are limits to God\u2019s ordained power (which come\nfrom the concept of a just agent): inside the space of worlds which God\ncould create by absolute power, there is a space of worlds which could\nbe created by ordered power. It is this smaller space of worlds which\nis relevant for our question of the necessity of causal connections.\nAnd, with respect to God\u2019s ordered power, there was a wide range of\ncausal assertions which were regarded as necessary by medieval\nthinkers.\nOne of the significant aspects of this distinction was that \u2013\nentirely apart from its theological motivation \u2013 it gave\nmedieval authors very powerful and flexible analytical tools. \nBuridan, for example, deploys this distinction in a very subtle\nanalysis of some extremely obscure arguments in Aristotle (Knuuttila 2001).\nScotus uses different, but related, arguments to investigate\nmodal questions such as that of the contingency of the\npresent. To some extent (although there is\nconsiderable argument about this area) these methods allowed\na far-reaching reformulation of the metaphysics of modality \n(Normore 2003; cf. Knuuttila 1993). \n\n",
