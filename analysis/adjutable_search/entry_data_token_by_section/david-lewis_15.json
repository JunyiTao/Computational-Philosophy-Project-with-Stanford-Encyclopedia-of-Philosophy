    "main_text": "Humean Supervenience || Causation\n5.2 Causation\n\nIn \u201cCausation\u201d (1973b), Lewis put forward an analysis of\n causation in terms of counterfactual dependence.\n The idea was that event B was counterfactually dependent on\nevent A if and only if the counterfactual Had A not\noccurred, B would not have occurred was true. Then event\nC causes event E if and only if there is a chain\nC, D1, \u2026, Dn,\nE such that each member in the chain (except C) is\ncounterfactually dependent on the event before it. In summary,\ncausation is the ancestral of counterfactual dependence.\n\nThe reasoning about chains helped Lewis sidestep a problem that many\nthought unavoidable for a counterfactual theory of causation, namely\nthe problem of pre-empting causes. Imagine that Suzy throws a rock,\nthe rock hits a window and the window shatters. Suzy\u2019s throw\ncaused the window to shatter. But there is a backup\nthrower\u2014Billy. Had Suzy not thrown, Billy would have thrown\nanother rock and broken the window. So the window breaking is not\ncounterfactually dependent on Suzy\u2019s throw. Lewis\u2019s\nsolution was to posit an event of the rock flying towards the window.\nHad Suzy not thrown, the rock would not have been flying towards the\nwindow. And had the rock not been flying towards the window, the\nwindow would have not shattered. Lewis\u2019s thought here is that it\nis Suzy\u2019s throwing that causes Billy to not throw; once she has\nthrown Billy is out of the picture and the window\u2019s shattering\ndepends only on what Suzy\u2019s rock does. So we avoid this problem\nof pre-empters.\n\nMuch of the argumentation in \u201cCausation\u201d concerns the\nsuperiority of the counterfactual analysis to deductive-nomological\ntheories. These arguments were so successful that from a contemporary\nperspective they seem somewhat quaint. There are so few supporters of\ndeductive-nomological theories in contemporary metaphysics that a\nmodern paper would not spend nearly so much time on them.\n\nAfter \u201cCausation\u201d the focus, at least of those interested\nin reductive theories, moved to counterfactual theories. And it became\nclear that Lewis had a bit of work left to do. He needed to say more\nabout the details of the notion of counterfactual dependence. He did\nthis in \u201cCounterfactual Dependence and Time\u2019s Arrow\u201d\n(1979c), as discussed in section 2. He needed to say more about the\nnature of events. In \u201cEvents\u201d (1986g) he said that they\nwere natural properties of regions of space-time. (At this stage he\nassumed that events were the relata of the causal relation. This\nassumption is criticised by L. A. Paul (2000), and in (2004d) Lewis\ndrops it.) And prodded by Jaegwon Kim (1973), he needed to add that\nA and B had to be wholly distinct events for\nB to counterfactually depend on A. The alternative\nwould be to say that an event\u2019s happening is caused by any\nessential part of the event, which is absurd.\n\nBut the biggest problem concerned what became known as \u201clate\npre-emption\u201d. In the rock throwing example above, we assumed\nthat Billy decided not to throw when he saw Suzy throwing. But we can\nimagine a variant of the case where Billy waits to see whether\nSuzy\u2019s rock hits, and only then decides not to throw. In such a\ncase, it is the window\u2019s shattering, not anything prior to this,\nthat causes Billy not to throw. That means that there is no event\nbetween Suzy\u2019s throw and the window\u2019s shattering on which\nthe shattering is counterfactually dependent.\n\nLewis addressed this issue in \u201cRedundant Causation\u201d, one\nof the six postscripts to the reprinting of \u201cCausation\u201d in\n(1986b). He started by introducing a new concept: quasi-dependence.\nB quasi-depends on A if and only if there is a\nprocess starting with A*, and ending with B* , and\nB* counterfactually depends on A*, and the process\nfrom A* to B* is an intrinsic duplicate of the\nprocess from A to B, and the laws governing the process from\nA* to B* (i.e. the laws of the world in which\nA* and B* happen) are the same as the laws governing\nthe process from A to B. In short, quasi-dependence\nis the relation you get if you start with dependence, then add all of\nthe duplicates of dependent processes. Causation is then the ancestral\nof quasi-dependence. Although the window\u2019s shattering does not\ndepend on Suzy\u2019s throw, it does quasi-depend on it. That\u2019s\nbecause there is a world, with the same laws, with a duplicate of\nSuzy\u2019s throw, but Billy determined not to throw, and in that\nworld the window shatters in just the same way, and depends on\nSuzy\u2019s throw.\n\nEventually, Lewis became unsatisfied with the quasi-dependence based\ntheory. In \u201cCausation as Influence\u201d (2000a, 2004a) he set\nout several reasons for being unhappy with it, and a new theory to\nsupersede it.\n\nOne argument against it is that it makes causation intrinsic to the\npair C and E, but some cases, especially cases of\ndouble prevention, show that causation is extrinsic. Double\nprevention occurs when an event, call it C, prevents\nsomething that would have prevented E from happening.\nIntuitively, these are cases of causation. Indeed, when we look at the\ndetails we find that many everyday cases of causation have this\npattern. But that C causes E does not depend on the\nintrinsic natures of C and E. Rather, it depends on\nthere being some threat to E, a threat that C\nprevents, and the existence of threats is typically extrinsic to\nevents.\n\nAnother argument is that quasi-dependence cannot account for what came\nto be known as \u2018trumping pre-emption\u2019. Lewis illustrated\nthis idea with an example from Jonathan Schaffer (2000). The troops\nare disposed to obey all orders from either the Sergeant or the Major.\nBut they give priority to the Major\u2019s orders, due to the\nMajor\u2019s higher rank. Both the Major and the Sergeant order the\ntroops to advance, and they do advance. Intuitively, it is the Major,\nnot the Sergeant, who caused the advance, since the Major\u2019s\norders have priority. But the advance does quasi-depend on the\nSergeant\u2019s orders, since in a world where the Major\ndoesn\u2019t make an order, the advance does depend on the\nSergeant.\n\nLewis\u2019s alternative theory relied on changing the definition of\ncounterfactual dependence. The theory in \u201cCausation\u201d was\nbased on what he came to call \u2018whether-whether\u2019\ndependence. What\u2019s crucial is that whether B\nhappens depends counterfactually on whether A\nhappens. The new theory was based on what we might call\n\u2018how-how\u2019 dependence. Lewis says that B depends\non A if there are large families of counterfactuals of the\nform If A had happened in this way, then B would\nhave happened in that way, and the ways in which B would\nhappen are systematically dependent on the ways in which A\nhappens. How much A influences B depends on how big\nthis family is, how much variation there is in the way B\nchanges, and how systematic the influence of A on B\nis. He then defines causation as the ancestral of this notion of\ncounterfactual dependence.\n\nOn this new theory, causation is a degree concept, rather than an\n\u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 concept, since counterfactual dependence\ncomes in degrees. Sometimes Lewis says we properly ignore small\namounts of causation. For instance, the location of nearby parked cars\ninfluences the smashing of a window by a rock in virtue of small\ngravitational effects of the cars on the flight of the rock. But\nit\u2019s very little influence, and we properly ignore it most of\nthe time.\n\nThere are two other notable features of \u201cCausation as\nInfluence\u201d. It contains Lewis\u2019s most comprehensive defence\nof the transitivity of causation. This principle was central to\nLewis\u2019s theory of causation from the earliest days, but had come\nunder sustained attack over the years. And the paper has a brief\nattack on non-Humean theories that take causation to be a primitive.\nLewis says that these theories can\u2019t explain the variety of\ncausal relations that we perceive and can think about. These passages\nmark an interesting change in what Lewis took to be the primary\nalternatives to his counterfactuals based reductionism. In 1973 the\nopponents were other kinds of reductionists; in 2000 they were the\nnon-reductionists.\n",
