    "main_text": "Kinds of Consciousness\n1. Kinds of Consciousness\n\nOne of the advances made in the last few decades has been to\ndistinguish between different questions concerning consciousness (see\nparticularly: Rosenthal 1986; Dretske 1993; Block 1995; Lycan 1996).\nNot everyone agrees on quite which distinctions need to be\ndrawn. But all are agreed that we should distinguish creature\nconsciousness from mental-state consciousness. It is one\nthing to say of an individual person or organism that it is\nconscious (either in general or of something in particular); and it is\nquite another thing to say of one of the mental states of a\ncreature that it is conscious.\n\nIt is also agreed that within creature-consciousness itself we should\ndistinguish between intransitive and transitive\nvariants. To say of an organism that it is conscious\nsimpliciter (intransitive) is to say just that it is awake,\nas opposed to asleep or comatose. There don\u2019t appear to be any\ndeep philosophical difficulties lurking here (or at least, they\naren\u2019t difficulties specific to the topic of consciousness, as\nopposed to mentality in general). But to say of an organism that it is\nconscious of such-and-such (transitive) is normally to say at\nleast that it is perceiving such-and-such, or aware\nof such-and-such. So we say of the mouse that it is conscious of\nthe cat outside its hole, in explaining why it doesn\u2019t come out;\nmeaning that it perceives the cat\u2019s presence. To\nprovide an account of transitive creature-consciousness would thus be\nto attempt a theory of perception.\n\nThere is a choice to be made concerning transitive\ncreature-consciousness, failure to notice which may be a potential\nsource of confusion. For we have to decide whether the perceptual\nstate in virtue of which an organism may be said to be\ntransitively-conscious of something must itself be a conscious one\n(state-conscious\u2014see below). If we say \u2018Yes\u2019 then we\nshall need to know more about the mouse than merely that it perceives\nthe cat if we are to be assured that it is conscious of the\ncat\u2014we shall need to establish that its percept of the cat is\nitself conscious. If we say \u2018No\u2019, on the other hand, then\nthe mouse\u2019s perception of the cat will be sufficient for the mouse to\ncount as conscious of the cat; but we may have to say that although it\nis conscious of the cat, the mental state in virtue of which it is so\nconscious is not itself a conscious one! It may be best to by-pass any\ndanger of confusion here by avoiding the language of\ntransitive-creature-consciousness altogether. Nothing of importance\nwould be lost to us by doing this. \n\nTurning now to the notion of mental-state consciousness, the\nmajor distinction here is between phenomenal consciousness,\non the one hand\u2014which is a property of states that it is\nlike something to be in, that have a distinctive\n\u2018feel\u2019 (Nagel 1974)\u2014and various\nfunctionally-definable forms of access consciousness, on the\nother (Block 1995). Most theorists believe that there are mental\nstates\u2014such as occurrent thoughts or judgments\u2014that are\naccess-conscious (in whatever is the correct functionally-definable\nsense), but that are not phenomenally conscious. In contrast, there is\nconsiderable dispute as to whether mental states can be\nphenomenally-conscious without also being conscious in the\nfunctionally-definable sense\u2014and even more dispute about whether\nphenomenal consciousness can be reductively explained in\nfunctional and/or representational terms.\n\nIt is plain that there is nothing deeply problematic about\nfunctionally-definable notions of mental-state consciousness, from a\nnaturalistic perspective. For mental functions and mental\nrepresentations are the staple fare of naturalistic accounts of the\nmind. But this leaves plenty of room for dispute about the form that\nthe correct functional account should take. Some claim that for a\nstate to be conscious in the relevant sense is for it to be poised to\nhave an impact on the organism\u2019s decision-making processes (Kirk 1994;\nDretske 1995; Tye 1995, 2000), perhaps also with the additional requirement\nthat those processes should be distinctively rational ones\n(Block 1995). Others think that the relevant requirement for\naccess-consciousness is that the state should be suitably related to\nhigher-order representations\u2014experiences and/or thoughts\u2014of\nthat very state (Armstrong 1968, 1984; Rosenthal 1986, 1993, 2005;\nDennett 1978a, 1991; Carruthers 1996, 2000, 2005; Lycan 1987,\n1996; Gennaro 2012).\n\nWhat is often thought to be naturalistically problematic, in\ncontrast, is phenomenal consciousness (Nagel 1974, 1984; Jackson 1982,\n1986; McGinn 1991; Block 1995; Chalmers 1996). And what is really and\ndeeply controversial is whether phenomenal consciousness can be\nexplained in terms of some or other functionally-definable\nnotion. Cognitive (or representational) theories\nmaintain that it can. Higher-order cognitive theories\nmaintain that phenomenal consciousness can be reductively explained in\nterms of representations (either experiences or thoughts) that are\nhigher-order. It is such theories that concern us here.\n",
