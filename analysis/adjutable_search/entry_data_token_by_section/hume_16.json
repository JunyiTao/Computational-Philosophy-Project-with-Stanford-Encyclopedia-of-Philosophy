    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Sentimentalism: Constructive Phase\n7.2 Sentimentalism: Constructive Phase\n\nIn Treatise 3.3.1, Hume turns to his constructive task of\nproviding a naturalistic explanation of the moral sentiments. He\nrefers to them as feelings of approval or disapproval, praise or\nblame, esteem or contempt. Approval is a kind of pleasant or agreeable\nfeeling; disapproval a kind of painful or disagreeable feeling. In\nseveral key passages, he describes the moral sentiments as calm forms\nof love and hatred. When we evaluate our own character traits, pride\nand humility replace love and hatred.\n\nHume\u2019s project is \u201cto discover the true origin of morals,\nand of that love or hatred, which arises\u201d (T 3.3.1/575) when we\ncontemplate our own or other people\u2019s character traits and\nmotives. He traces the moral sentiments to sympathy. Sympathy\nis a psychological mechanism that explains how we come to feel what\nothers are feeling. It is not itself a feeling or sentiment and so\nshould not be confused with feelings of compassion or pity. Hume\nappeals to sympathy to explain a wide range of phenomena: our interest\nin history and current affairs, our ability to enjoy literature,\nmovies, and novels, as well as our sociability. It is central to his\nexplanations of our passions, our sense of beauty, and our sense of\nwhat is morally good and bad.\n\nSympathy is a process that moves me from my idea of what someone is\nfeeling to actually experiencing the feeling. There are four steps to\nthis process. I first arrive at the idea of what someone is feeling in\nany of the usual ways. I next become aware of the\nresemblances between us, so we are linked by that principle\nof association. While we resemble every human being to some extent, we\nalso resemble some individuals more than others\u2014for instance,\nthose who share our language or culture or are the same age and sex as\nwe are. The associative principles of contiguity and\ncausality also relate individuals who are located closely to\nus in time or space or who are family members or teachers. According\nto Hume, we are able to sympathize more easily and strongly with\nindividuals with whom we have strong associative ties. The stronger\nthe associative relations, the stronger our sympathetic responses.\nHume then claims\u2014controversially\u2014that we always have a\nvivid awareness of ourselves. Finally, he reminds us that the\nprinciples of association not only relate two perceptions, but they\nalso transmit force and vivacity from one perception to another.\n\nSuppose my friend recently suffered a devastating loss and I realize\nshe is feeling sad. The associative principles transmit force and\nvivacity from my vivid awareness of myself to my idea of my\nfriend\u2019s sadness. Since for Hume the difference between\nimpressions and ideas is that impressions are more lively and\nvivacious than ideas, if an idea of a passion is sufficiently\nenlivened, it becomes the very passion itself. I now feel sad too, but\nnot quite as strongly as my friend.\n\nThe way Hume uses the idea that the associative principles transmit\nforce and vivacity in his explanation of sympathy is parallel to the\nway he uses it in his explanation of causal inference. In the case of\ncausal inference, if we have an impression of an effect (smoke), the\nassociative principles give rise not only to the idea of its cause\n(fire), but they also transmit some of the impression\u2019s force\nand vivacity to the idea of its cause, so that we come to believe that\nfire is the cause of the smoke. A belief is an idea that is so lively\nthat it is like an impression, and influences us in the way\nimpressions do. Similarly, my lively awareness of myself enlivens by\nassociation my idea of my friend\u2019s sadness. But the result in\nthe case of sympathy is even stronger: when an idea of a passion is\nsufficiently enlivened, it becomes the very passion itself.\n\nOne advantage Hume\u2019s explanation of the moral sentiments in\nterms of sympathy has over Hutcheson\u2019s claim that we possess a\nGod-given moral sense is that it enables him to provide a unified\ntheory of the mind. He explains the moral sentiments by appealing to\nsympathy, which, in turn, he explains in terms of the same associative\nprinciples he invoked to explain causal beliefs. Without sympathy, and\nthe associative principles that explain it, we would be unimaginably\ndifferent than we are\u2014creatures without causal or moral\nideas.\n\nHume develops his account of moral evaluation further in response to\ntwo objections to his claim that the moral sentiments arise from\nsympathy. The first is the \u201csympathy is variable\u201d\nobjection. Sympathy enables us to enter into the feelings of anyone,\neven strangers, because we resemble everyone to some extent. But it is\nan essential feature of his account of the natural and spontaneous\noperation of sympathy that our ability to respond sympathetically to\nothers varies with variations in the associative relations. I am able\nto sympathize more easily and strongly with someone who resembles me\nor is related to me by contiguity or causation. The objection is that\nthe moral sentiments can\u2019t be based in sympathy because the\nloves and hatreds that result from the natural and spontaneous\nworkings of sympathy vary, but our moral approval doesn\u2019t vary.\nThe second objection is that \u201cvirtue in rags\u201d still evokes\nour approval. Sympathy works by looking at the actual effects of a\nperson\u2019s character traits, but sometimes misfortune or lack of\nopportunity may prevent an individual from exercising their good\ncharacter traits, yet we still admire them.\n\nHume argues that moral love and hatred spring from sympathy, but only\nwhen we regulate our sympathetic reactions by taking up what he calls\n\u201cthe general point of view\u201d. There are two regulatory\nfeatures to the general point of view. The first is that we survey a\nperson\u2019s character from the perspective of the person and his\nusual associates\u2014friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers. We\nsympathize with the person and the people with whom that person\nregularly interacts and judge character traits in terms of whether\nthey are good or bad for these people. Second, we regulate sympathy\nfurther by relying on general rules that specify the general effects\nand tendencies of character traits rather than sympathizing with their\nactual effects.\n\nBy putting together these two regulatory features, we arrive at\nHume\u2019s idea of the general point of view, which defines a\nperspective from which we may survey a person\u2019s character traits\nthat we share with everyone. When we occupy the general point of view,\nwe sympathize with the person herself and her usual associates, and\ncome to admire the person for traits that are normally good for\neveryone. The general point of view is, for Hume, the moral\nperspective. We do not experience the moral sentiments unless we have\nalready taken up the general point of view. The moral sentiments and\nthe concepts to which they give rise are products of taking up that\nstandpoint.\n\nHume offers the claim that we admire four sorts of character\ntraits\u2014those that are useful or immediately agreeable to the\nagent or to others\u2014as an empirical hypothesis. While he provides\nsupport for it in his discussion of the individual virtues, he also\nuses his fourfold classification to undermine Christian conceptions of\nmorality. He makes pride a virtue and humility a vice. He throws out\nthe \u201cmonkish\u201d virtues\u2014celibacy, fasting, and\npenance\u2014on the grounds that they are not pleasant or useful to\nanyone. He also rejects the distinction between virtues and natural\ntalents, which legislators, \u201cdivines\u201d and modern moralists\ndefend by claiming that the moral virtues are voluntary, whereas\nnatural talents aren\u2019t. Their goal is to reform us\u2014or at\nleast our outward behavior\u2014making us better, when understood in\nChristian terms. They accordingly restrict the domain of the moral to\nactions that proceed from character traits because they believe only\nthey can be modified, shaped, and controlled by sanctions, while\ntalents can\u2019t. Hume, however, rejects the distinction along with\nthe dubious function these reformers assign to morality.\n\nHume identifies both what has value and what makes things valuable\nwith features of our psychology. Our first-order sentiments, passions\nand affections, as well as actions expressive of them, are what have\nmoral value. Our second-order reflective sentiments about our own or\nother people\u2019s sentiments, passions and affections are what give\nthem value. On his view, morality is entirely a product of human\nnature.\n\nIn the \u201cConclusion\u201d of the second Enquiry, Hume\nsummarizes his explanation of morality with a definition of virtue or\nmerit:\n\n\nevery quality of mind, which is useful or agreeable\nto the person himself or to others,\ncommunicates a pleasure to the spectator, engages his esteem, and is\nadmitted under the honourable denomination of virtue or merit. (EPM\n9.1.12/277)\n\n\nThis is a precise parallel of his two definitions of cause in the\nfirst Enquiry. Both sets of definitions pick out features of\nevents, and both record a spectator\u2019s response to those\nevents.\n",
