    "main_text": "The Desire-Frustration Theory of Suspense\n3. The Desire-Frustration Theory of Suspense\n\n\nAaron Smuts defends the desire-frustration theory of suspense, which \nholds that the frustration of a desire to affect the outcome of an \nimmanent event is both necessary and sufficient to create suspense. \nWhereas Carroll revises the first claim, Smuts simply denies that \nuncertainty is necessary for suspense (Smuts 2008). Smuts appeals to \nexamples such as Psycho\u2014which are more suspenseful on \nrepeated to encounters\u2014and historical re-enactments such as \nTouching the Void (2004)\u2014where the audience knows the \noutcome before the first viewing\u2014to support the claim that \nuncertainty is unnecessary for suspense. \n\n\nSmuts argues that in all suspenseful narratives and in all \nsuspenseful situations in real life we find factors that partially \nfrustrate one\u2019s ability to satisfy a desire, factors that suspend \none\u2019s efficacy. He argues that even when the stakes are high, if one \nis actively working towards the realization of a desired outcome, \nthere can be no suspense. Smuts\u2019 explanation of why fictions are \nextremely effective at creating suspense and how suspense in response\nto fictions is possible when we know the outcome is this: In contrast\nwith our engagement with real situations, where we can actively work \ntowards the satisfaction of a desire, in engaging with fictions we \nare completely powerless. \n\n\nSmuts notes that our inability to affect fictions is something we are\noften aware of, and something the masters of suspense frequently make\nprominent. For instance, one of the most suspenseful episodes in \nHitchcock\u2019s Rear Window (1954) is that in which Lisa (Grace \nKelly) is looking for evidence of murder in the apartment across the \nway. Through binoculars, Jeff (James Stewart) sees Thorwald enter his\napartment as Lisa is hunting around in the bedroom. Jeff\u2019s position \nmirrors that of the audience: We are unable to warn Lisa of the \ndanger, utterly incapable of using our knowledge to affect the \noutcome. Similarly, Smuts and Frome argue that the most suspenseful \nvideogames are those where the player is temporarily taken out of \ncontrol, having to wait to see how a jump turns out or whether his or\nher character will be discovered by sniffing guard dogs. Smuts\u2019 \nexplanation is that the partial frustration of our ability to satisfy\nour desires is necessary to the creation of suspense. \n\n\nThere are at least two important questions unanswered by the \ndesire-frustration theory. First, why do suspenseful events need to \nbe imminent? This element of the theory is under-developed, raising \ndoubts about its claims to sufficiency. The defender of the \ndesire-frustration theory might be able to reply that this is merely \na function of the way we desire\u2014near events provoke much \nstronger responses than those that are distant. But, as it stands, \nthe account is incomplete. \n\n\nSecond, one can feel suspense in response to situations where one \nmight not readily consent to having a desire. If so, the frustration \nof a desire would not be necessary for suspense. For instance, in \nMichael Clayton (2008) the two thugs hired to kill the \nprotagonist try to install a tracking device in his car radio. Before\nthey can finish, Michael starts walking back to his car. The scene is\nincredibly suspenseful, but what desire is frustrated? I cannot \nrecall desiring to warn Michael. Is it the desire to see the thugs \nget away unnoticed? That would be odd. It is not clear why audiences \nwould desire to see the installation complete, since our sympathies \ncertainly lie with Michael and not his pursuers. But neither does it \nseem that we want to do something to stop the installation of the \ntracking device. \n\nAn additional worry that has been raised for the desire frustration\ntheory is that the desire to change a fictional world is a desire that\nnecessarily can\u2019t be satisfied. As such it is a deviant desire that\nmay be seen as implausibly weird (Uidhir 2011a, 2011b). On the other\nhand, such desires may be thought of as \u201cwishes\u201d. For\ninstance, if I regret some past action, it is plausible to say that I\nwish I could change the past. It is a common sort of desire, even\nthough it can\u2019t be satisfied.\n",
