    "main_text": "1877b: The combinatorial argument || Remarks and problems\n4.1 Remarks and problems\n\n\n1. No dynamical assumption is made; i.e., it is not relevant to the\nargument whether or how the particles collide. It might seem that this\nmakes the present argument more general than the previous one. Indeed,\nBoltzmann suggests at the end of the paper that the same argument might\nbe applicable also to dense gases and even to solids. \n\n\nHowever, it should be noticed that the assumption that the total\nenergy can be expressed in the form \\(E = \\sum_i n_i\\epsilon_i\\) means\nthat the energy of each particle depends only on the cell in which it\nis located, and not the state of other particles. This can only be\nmaintained, independently of the number \\(N\\), if there is no\ninteraction at all between the particles. The validity of the argument\nis thus really restricted to ideal gases.\n\n\n2. The procedure of dividing \\(\\mu\\) space into cells is essential\nhere. Indeed, the whole prospect of using combinatorics would\ndisappear if we did not adopt a partition. But the choice to take all\ncells equal in size in position and momentum variables is not quite\nself-evident, as Boltzmann himself shows. In fact, before he develops\nthe argument above, his paper first discusses an analysis in which the\nparticles are characterized by their energy instead of position and\nmomentum. This leads him to carve up \\(\\mu\\)-space into cells of equal\nsize in energy. He then shows that this analysis fails to reproduce\nthe desired Maxwell distribution as the most probable state. This\nfailure is remedied by taking equally sized cells in position and\nmomentum variables. The latter choice is apparently\n\u2018right\u2019, in the sense that leads to the desired\nresult. However, since the choice clearly cannot be relegated to a\nmatter of convention, it leaves the question for a justification.\n\n\n3. A crucial new ingredient in the argument is the distinction between\nmicro- and macrostates. Note in particular that where in the previous\nwork the distribution function \\(f\\) was identified with a probability\n(namely of a molecular state), in the present paper it, or its\ndiscrete analogy \\(Z\\) is a description of the macrostate of the\ngas. Probabilities are not assigned to the particles, but to the\nmacrostate of the gas as a whole. According to Klein (1973, 84), this\nconceptual transition in 1877b marks the birth of statistical\nmechanics. While this view is not completely correct (as we have seen,\nBoltzmann 1868 already applied probability to the total gas), it is\ntrue that (1877b) is the first occasion where Boltzmann identifies\nprobability of a gas state with relative volume in phase space, rather\nthan its relative time of duration.\n\n\nAnother novelty is that Boltzmann has changed his concept of\nequilibrium. Whereas previously the essential characteristic of an\nequilibrium state was always that it is stationary, in Boltzmann's new\nview it is conceived as the macrostate (i.e., a region in phase space)\nthat can be realized in the largest number of ways. As a result, an\nequilibrium state need not be stationary: in the course of time, the\nsystem may fluctuate in and out of equilibrium.\n4. But what about evolutions? Perhaps the most important\nissue is the question what exactly the relation is of the 1877b paper\nto Loschmidt\u2019s objection and Boltzmann\u2019s p reply to it (1877a)? The\nprimary reply can be read as an announcement of two subjects of\nfurther investigation:\n\nFrom the relative numbers of the various distributions of state, one\nmight even be able to calculate their probabilities. This could lead\nto an interesting method of determining thermal equilibrium (W.A. II,\np. 121)\n\nThis is a problem about equilibrium. The second announcement was that\nBoltzmann said: \n\n \u201cThe case is completely analogous for the Second Law\u201d (W.A.. II, p. 121).\n\nBecause there are so very many more uniform than non-uniform\ndistributions, it should be extraordinarily improbable that a system\nshould evolve from a uniform distribution of states to a non-uniform\ndistribution of states. This is a problem about evolution. In other\nwords, one would like to see that something like the statistical\nH-theorem actually holds.  Boltzmann\u2019s (1877b) is widely read as a\nfollow-up to these announcements. Indeed, Boltzmann repeats the first\nquote above in the introduction of the paper (W.A. II, p. 165),\nindicating that he will address this problem. And so he does,\nextensively. Yet he also states:\n\nOur main goal is not to linger on a discussion of thermal equilibrium,\nbut to investigate the relations of probability with the Second Law of\nthermodynamics (W.A.. II, p. 166).\n\n\nThus, the main goal of 1877b is apparently to address the problem\nconcerning evolutions and to show how they relate to the Second\nLaw. Indeed, this is what one would naturally expect since the\nreversibility objection is, after all, a problem concerned with\nevolutions. Even so, a remarkable fact is that the 1877b paper hardly\never touches its self-professed \u201cmain goal\u201d at all.  For a sketch of\nhow different commentators on Boltzmann's (1877b) view his attitude on\nthis question I refer to Uffink (2007).\n To sum up this discussion of Boltzmann\u2019s answer to the\nreversibility objection: it seems that on all above readings of his\ntwo 1877 papers, the lacuna between what Boltzmann had achieved and\nwhat he needed to do to answer Loschmidt satisfactorily \u2013\ni.e. to address the issue of the evolution of distributions of state\nand to prove that non-uniform distributions tend, in some statistical\nsense, to uniform ones, or to prove any other reformulation of the\nH-theorem \u2013 remains striking.\n",
