    "main_text": "No-go results in quantum gravity\n5. No-go results in quantum gravity\n\n\nThree degrees of quantum involvement in gravity can be distinguished.\nThe first degree, referred to as quantum field theory on curved \nspacetimes, simply takes off the shelf a spacetime provided by \ngeneral relativity theory and then proceeds to study the behavior of \nquantum fields on this background spacetime. The Unruh effect, which \npredicts the thermalization of a free scalar quantum field near the \nhorizon of a black hole, lies within this ambit. The second degree of\ninvolvement, referred to as semi-classical quantum gravity, attempts \nto calculate the backreaction of the quantum fields on spacetime \nmetric by computing the expectation value \n\\(\\langle \\Psi \\mid T_{ab} \\mid \\Psi \\rangle\\) of the stress-energy \ntensor in some appropriate quantum state \\(\\lvert\\Psi\\rangle\\) and then \ninserting the value into Einstein\u2019s field equations in place of \n\\(T_{ab}\\).[26]\n Hawking\u2019s celebrated prediction of black hole radiation belongs to \nthis \n ambit.[27]\n The third degree of involvement attempts to produce a genuine quantum\ntheory of gravity in the sense that the gravitational degrees of \nfreedom are quantized. Currently loop quantum gravity and string \ntheory are the main research programs aimed at this \n goal.[28]\n\n\n\nThe first degree of quantum involvement, if not opening the door to \nThornian time machines, at least seemed to remove some obstacles \nsince quantum fields are known to lead to violations of the energy \nconditions used in the setting of classical general relativity theory\nto prove chronology protection theorems and no-go results for time \nmachines. However, the second degree of quantum involvement seemed, \nat least initially, to slam the door shut. The intuitive idea was \nthis. Start with a general relativistic spacetime where CTCs develop \nto the future of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) (often referred to \nas the \u201cchronology horizon\u201d) for some suitable partial \nCauchy surface \\(\\Sigma\\). Find that the propagation of a quantum field \non this spacetime background is such that \n\\(\\langle \\Psi \\mid T_{ab} \\mid\\Psi \\rangle\\) \u201cblows up\u201d as\n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is approached from the past. Conclude\nthat the backreaction on the spacetime metric creates unbounded \ncurvature, which effectively cuts off the future development that \nwould otherwise eventuate in CTCs. These intuitions were partly \nvindicated by detailed calculations in several models. But eventually\na number of exceptions were found in which the backreaction remains \narbitrarily small near \n \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\).[29]\n This seemed to leave the door ajar for Thornian time machines.\n\n\nBut fortunes were reversed once again by a result of Kay, \nRadzikowski, and Wald (1997). The details of their theorem are too \ntechnical to review here, but the structure of the argument is easy \nto grasp. The na\u00efve calculation of \n\\(\\langle \\Psi \\mid T_{ab}\\mid\\Psi \\rangle\\) results in infinities \nwhich have to be subtracted off to produce a renormalized expectation\nvalue \n\\(\\langle \\Psi \\mid T_{ab}\\mid\\Psi \\rangle_R\\) with\na finite value. The standard renormalization procedure uses a \nlimiting procedure that is mathematically well-defined if, and only \nif, a certain condition \n obtains.[30]\n The KRW theorem shows that this condition is violated for points on \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) and, thus, that the expectation value\nof the stress-energy tensor is not well-defined at the chronology \nhorizon.\n\n\nWhile the KRW theorem is undoubtedly of fundamental importance for \nsemi-classical quantum gravity, it does not serve as an effective \nno-go result for Thornian time machines. In the first place, the \ntheorem assumes, in concert with Hawking\u2019s chronology protection \ntheorem, that \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is compactly generated,\nand we repeat that it is far from clear that this assumption is \nnecessary for seeing a Thornian time machine in operation. A second, \nand more fundamental, reservation applies even if a compactly \ngenerated \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is accepted as a necessary \ncondition for time machines. The KRW theorem functions as a no-go \nresult by providing a reductio ad absurdum with a dubious \nabsurdity: roughly, if you try to operate a Thornian time machine, \nyou will end up invalidating semi-classical quantum gravity. But \nsemi-classical quantum gravity was never viewed as anything more than\na stepping stone to a genuine quantum theory of gravity, and its \nbreakdown is expected to be manifested when Planck-scale physics \ncomes into play. This worry is underscored by Visser\u2019s (1997, 2003) \nfindings that in chronology violating models trans-Planckian physics \ncan be expected to come into play before \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is reached.\n\n\nIt thus seems that if some quantum mechanism is to serve as the basis\nfor chronology protection, it must be found in the third degree of \nquantum involvement in gravity. Both loop quantum gravity and string \ntheory have demonstrated the ability to cure some of the curvature \nsingularities of classical general relativity theory. But as far as \nwe are aware there are no demonstrations that either of these \napproaches to quantum gravity can get rid of the acausal features \nexhibited in various solutions to Einstein\u2019s field equations. An \nalternative approach to formulate a fully-fledged quantum theory of \ngravity attempts to capture the Planck-scale structure of spacetime \nby constructing it from causal \n sets.[31]\n Since these sets must be acyclic, i.e., no element in a causal set \ncan causally precede itself, CTCs are ruled out a priori. Actually, a\ntheorem due to Malament (1977) suggests that any Planck-scale \napproach encoding only the causal structure of a spacetime cannot \npermit CTCs either in the smooth classical spacetimes or a \ncorresponding phenomenon in their quantum \n counterparts.[32]\n\n\n\nIn sum, the existing no-go results that use the first two degrees of \nquantum involvement are not very convincing, and the third degree of \ninvolvement is not mature enough to allow useful pronouncements. \nThere is, however, a rapidly growing literature on the possibility of\ntime travel in lower-dimensional supersymmetric cousins of string \ntheory. For a review of these recent results and a discussion of the \nfate of a time-traveller\u2019s ambition in loop quantum gravity, see \nSmeenk and W\u00fcthrich (2010).\n",
