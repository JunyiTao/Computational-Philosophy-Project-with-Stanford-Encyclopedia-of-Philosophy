    "main_text": "Principles of Property and Contracts\n5. Principles of Property and Contracts\n\nContracts lie at the very core of economic thought. A simple purchase\nis a type of contract, the use of money another. Property rights are\nalso grounded in the idea of a contract, at least since the early\nmodern period. Aristotle had argued in favor of private property,\nprimarily with appeals to security and superior stewardship. Aquinas\nreinforced these claims but also argued that in the case of a famine\nor siege, one might appropriate available foods to fulfil the\nChristian dictate of self-preservation. In the early modern period,\nBodin, Grotius, and Pufendorf reflected at length on the question of\nproperty rights, prompted by the breakdown of feudal land tenure and\never-expanding overseas trade. Grotius\u2019s De Mare\nLiberum (1609) addressed the possibility of unregulated naval and\nfishing rights. Hobbes (1651) and Locke (1689), with their respective\nappeals to the state of nature, motivated the formation of property\nrights and hence the government. Sovereign rule would alleviate\npenury, facilitate the spread of trade and commerce and, above all,\nfoster population growth, or so it was widely believed.\n\nPopulation growth, providing more hands as well as the demand for more\ncorn and cloth, was viewed as the primary source of economic\nprosperity for about two centuries, until the alarm bell sounded by\nThomas Robert Malthus\u2019s Essay on the Principle of\nPopulation (1798). Whereas for Hobbes, might made right, Locke\ngrounded property rights in consent and the virtue of industriousness;\nthose who enclosed and cultivated the land created a right to its\nyield that did no harm to one\u2019s neighbors (see Sreenivasan\n1995). Because children are one\u2019s property, this also\nlegitimated the transfer of accumulated wealth via inheritance. Over\ntime, inequality became salient, as some owned land while others, less\nfortunate, were compelled to enter into a wage contract to earn their\nbread and ale. Locke, however, underscored the volitional nature of\nthese arrangements, forged on equal terms and by \u201ctacit\nconsent\u201d.\n\nWhile a strong advocate of traditional property laws to insure\neconomic flourishing, Hume underscored their contingent nature,\npointing to the voluminous quantity of law books that meant\ninterpretation would never come to an end. In opposition to Locke,\nHume believed that the appeal to an ancient contract forming the\ncommonwealth was merely a myth. Ancient land rights were primarily\ngained by conquest and usurpation, and sustained by privilege, rather\nthan a reward to the sweat of one\u2019s brow. By contrast, the\nmodern commercial era that enabled the spread of capital and hence\nmoveable wealth, moved in step with the rise of representative\ngovernment, either in the form of a republic or a constitutional\nmonarchy such as his own (McArthur 2007; Harris 2015).\n\nIn his Treatise of Human Nature (Book Three) Hume unpacked\nthe essential components of a contract. He identified the implicit\nconventions in contracts and the importance of trust.\n\n\nYour corn is ripe to-day; mine will be so to-morrow. \u2019Tis\nprofitable for us both, that I shou\u2019d labour with you to-day,\nand that you shou\u2019d aid me to-morrow. (Hume 1739\u201340 [2000:\n334])\n\n\nSuch contractual arrangements might exist and spread among strangers\nas individuals came to discern their benefits. As Hume observed,\n\n\nthe freedom and extent of human commerce depend entirely on a fidelity\nwith regard to promises. (1739\u201340 [2000: 349])\n\n\nThis included the use of money, which Hume recognized symbolized a\nchain of pledges, extending backward and forward in time. Property,\nmoney, and markets were thus bundled together, as conventions that ran\nno deeper than the utility of promise-keeping and one\u2019s\nhonor.\n\nHume took up the matter of forging an honorable character in his\nEnquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (1751). Although\nthe sphere for exercising one\u2019s free will to reform one\u2019s\ncharacter was very limited, Hume adhered to the gradual evolution of\nbehavioral norms, forged by material conditions, particularly commerce\nand trade. Monkish virtues of the medieval period had given way to\ncommercial virtues of the modern period, honesty, probity and\nindustry. For Adam Smith, self-command, prudence, and courage were\nvirtues ranked more highly than others. For these reasons, those in\nthe middling ranks, merchants and bankers, were more likely to happen\nonto the road to virtue than those in the lower or upper classes. And\nbecause the nouveau riches were the ones to safeguard contractual\nsettlements, this meant that the core institutions of property and\ncommerce would, ceteris paribus, be sustained in the\ncenturies ahead. The merchant or banker, not the knight, had become\nthe paragon of honor, serving the national interests as much as\nthemselves.\n",
