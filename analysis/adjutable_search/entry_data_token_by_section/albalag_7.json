    "main_text": "God-world Relationship || Divine Will\n5.2 Divine Will\n\nWithin the framework of the theory of eternal creation, Albalag deals\nwith another problematic issue, which also links to al-Ghazali\u2019s\nrefutations of philosophers in Tah\u0101fut\nal-Fal\u0101sifah: the nature of divine causation, whether it is\nvoluntary or involuntary. In this treatise, Al-Ghazali maintains that\nvolition is a fundamental characteristic of acting causes; \u201cthe\nagent must be willing, choosing and knowing what he wills \u201d\n(Tah\u0101fut al-Fal\u0101sifah, third discussion:\n135). Causes that act by necessity, that is, without willing or\nchoosing, fall in the category of natural involuntary\ncauses. Proceeding from this conception of agency, Al-Ghazali asserts\nthat the conception of divine causation that philosophers espouse\ndeprives the deity of volition. Again, the theory of eternity is\nbrought into focus. Necessity is a key postulation of the scheme of\neternity. Philosophers, according to al-Ghazali, hold the perpetual\nprocession of the universe from God to be necessary in the same manner\nthat the connection between \u201cthe sun and light\u201d is\nnecessary (Tah\u0101fut, third discussion: 135;\ncf. Tiqqun n.23: 24). In opposition to al-Ghazali, Albalag\nbroadens the conception of agency to include both involuntary natural\nand voluntary causes. However, he emphasizes that a natural cause is\ninsufficient to produce an effect. It must primarily be moved by a\nvoluntary agent. In the empirical world, natural causes bring forth\neffects inasmuch as they are being moved by close or remote voluntary\nagents. In this connection, Albalag states that \u201cin this way all\nmaterial effects are related to God and it is said of Him that He is\ntheir Maker\u201d, vaguely indicating that God is the ultimate\nvoluntary cause in the universe. Other than articulating the God-world\ncausal relationship in terms of motion, Albalag barely explains the\nnature of divine will or the manner in which it causes the perpetual\nproduction of the universe.\n\nIn other contexts, Albalag argues, in opposition to al-Ghazali, that\ndivine agency is neither natural nor voluntary, but an intermediary\ntype that lies beyond human understanding. This, however, does not\nmean that God has no will. The truth is that God has a capacity that\nconstitutes for Him what will constitutes for human beings. The exact\nnature of this capacity, which human beings call will, is obscure,\neven though demonstration establishes that it exists. Nonetheless,\nconsidering the defining criteria of the conception of divine\nperfection, it is inferred that this capacity shares no features with\nempirical will. Unlike empirical will which follows from a stimulus\nand seeks to fulfill a desire, divine will is self-sufficient. While\nempirical will is temporal, originates with a stimulus and perishes as\nsoon as the desire is fulfilled, divine will, consistently with the\neternal and immutable nature of God, is eternal and immutable, being\ncharacterized as a benevolent and immutable capacity to eternally\n\u201cchoose\u201d the best of two opposite things: \n\n\nEven though He possesses power over everything, the manner of His will\nis such that it constantly attaches itself to a single object, the\nbest among two opposites. Certainly, if He willed evil He would be\ncapable of doing it, but His will desires nothing but what is good\nonly. (Tiqqun n.23: 24 [my translation]; cf. Guide\nIII:25 where Maimonides states that God acts in the best way) \n\n\nOn this basis, the universe maintains a fixed natural order such that\n\u201cnothing can be added to or reduced from it\u201d\n(Tiqqun n.30: 39), since God\u2019s will continuously and\nimmutably chooses this order.\n",
