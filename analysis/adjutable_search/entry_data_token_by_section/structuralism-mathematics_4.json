    "main_text": "Later Developments and a Broader Taxonomy || Several Additional Variants of Structuralism\n2.2 Several Additional Variants of Structuralism\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in many discussions of structuralism, from the\n1980s to the early 2000s and beyond, a few positions have taken center\nstage: Shapiro\u2019s, Hellman\u2019s, sometimes Parsons\u2019, and\noccasionally Resnik\u2019s. But other forms of structuralism have\nbeen around for decades too. These deserve, and are starting to get,\nmore attention as well. Without any claim to comprehensiveness, we\nwant to mention several noteworthy examples. A major one, whose\norigins can be traced back to before the 1960s, is\n\u201cset-theoretic structuralism\u201d (cf. Reck & Price 2000,\nalso Reck & Schiemer forthcoming). To introduce it, let us\nreconsider the example central to Benacerraf\u2019s 1965 paper: the\nnatural numbers. \n\nAs Benacerraf argued, there is something wrong with identifying\n\u201cthe natural numbers\u201d with a particular set-theoretic\nsystem; or at least, it seems wrong to do so in any absolute sense.\nBenacerraf\u2019s conclusion was that numbers are not sets, nor\nobjects of any kind, but positions in a structure. Now, one can agree\nwith almost everything Benacerraf says and still want to identify\n\u201cthe natural numbers\u201d with some set-theoretic system in a\nless absolute sense.  In doing so, one can admit that any other model\nof the Dedekind-Peano axioms \u201cwould do as well\u201d, i.e.,\ncould have been chosen instead (except perhaps for pragmatic reasons,\ne.g., the ability to generalize to the transfinite). This means that\nwhat we identify as the natural numbers depends on an initial,\nprovisional, and somewhat arbitrary choice. For most mathematical\npurposes, such a pragmatic identification is sufficient; in fact, this\nis exactly what one does in standard axiomatic set theory. The\nresulting position deserves again to be counted as a form of\nstructuralism, as its defenders insist. What makes it structuralist is\nthe \u201cindifference to identify\u201d the natural numbers in any\nmore absolute sense (cf. Burgess 2015). \n\nThe core of set-theoretic structuralism, as just described, is to\nchoose one of several isomorphic systems as the pragmatic referent for\n\u201cthe natural numbers\u201d (similarly for the real numbers\netc.). In a sense, our talk of \u201cthe natural numbers\u201d, then\nalso of \u201cthe number 0\u201d, \u201cthe number 1\u201d, etc.,\nis relative to this initial choice. This is seen as unproblematic\nbecause, no matter how we choose, we will get the same arithmetic\ntheorems (because of the categoricity of the axiom system, which\nimplies its semantic completeness). As background, we can again employ\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory. But we can also broaden the approach\nslightly by allowing for \u201catoms\u201d or\n\u201curelements\u201d, i.e., objects that are not sets. Thus, we\ncan include Julius Caesar or some beer mug in our domain, with the\nconsequence that either of them can \u201cbe\u201d the number 2,\nsay, in the sense of taking up the \u201c2-position\u201d in the\nmodel for arithmetic we choose to work with. Because of this feature,\nwe will use \u201crelativist structuralism\u201d for this approach\n(cf. Reck & Price 2000). It also seems fair to say that this\nposition, particularly in its set-theoretic version, is accepted by\nmany mathematicians, explicitly or implicitly.  In fact, it may be the\nmost widely favored form of structuralism.\n\nIn set-theoretic structuralism, and in relativist structuralism more\nbroadly, the only mathematical objects at play are those that\naxiomatic set theory, possibly with urelements, allows us to\nintroduce. We do not need to postulate abstract structures in\naddition. For that reason, the position is another form of eliminative\nstructuralism (while it is not fully eliminative insofar as it\ncountenances sets).  In fact, set-theoretic relational systems (the\nset-theoretic models of theories) are themselves taken to be the\nrelevant structures here. (It is exactly such relational systems that\nare called \u201cstructures\u201d in many mathematics textbooks.)\nHowever, there is another option in connection with the\nlatter. Namely, we can also identify the structure of the natural\nnumbers, say, with the (higher-order) concept defined by the\nDedekind-Peano axioms; similarly for other (categorical) axiom\nsystems. This leads to yet another eliminative form of structuralism:\n\u201cconcept structuralism\u201d (cf. Isaacson 2010, Feferman 2014,\nalso Ketland 2015, Other Internet Resources).\n\nAccording to concept structuralism, what matters in modern axiomatic\nmathematics aren\u2019t really objects, especially not problematic\nabstract objects.  Rather, crucial are mathematical concepts, e.g.,\nthe concept \u201cnatural number system\u201d (or \u201cmodel of\nthe Dedekind-Peano axioms\u201d, \u201cprogression\u201d);\nsimilarly for the concept \u201ccomplete ordered field\u201d\netc. (In Ketland 2015, Other Internet Resources, such concepts are\nexplicated further in terms of intensional propositional functions,\nwhile Isaacson and Feferman leave their nature more open.) More\nprecisely, what matters in the end is what follows from those\nconcepts, in the sense of what can be derived from the corresponding\naxioms. It is true, as concept structuralists might admit, that often\nthe way in which we reason in mathematics involves talking about\nobjects falling under the relevant concepts. But as they would add,\nsuch talk can be explained away in the end (e.g., by taking up a\nformalist position). In this or similar forms, concept structuralism\nseems again a fairly widespread view among mathematicians and\nlogicians, even though it has not been very prominent in the\nstructuralism debates until recently.\n\nFor the sake of a more comprehensive survey, we want to go even\nfurther.  As the next step, we will introduce two forms of\nstructuralism that are closely related to relativist structuralism and\nconcept structuralism but not identical with either. (Both are forms\nof \u201cabstractionist structuralism\u201d, as we will see.)  Let\nus start again with a higher-order concept defined by an axiom system,\nsuch as \u201cnatural number system\u201d, together with the\nset-theoretic systems falling under it. However, instead of\nidentifying the corresponding structure either with that concept or\nwith some pragmatically chosen system falling under it, we focus on\nthe whole equivalence class determined by the concept.\n\nAt this point, we can go down one of two \u201cabstractionist\u201d\npaths. First, we can simply identify the relevant structure with that\nequivalence class (with the \u201cconcept in extension\u201d, as it\nis sometimes put). Thus, corresponding to the concept \u201cnatural\nnumber system\u201d and set-theoretic systems falling under it, like\nthe finite von Neumann ordinals, there is the entire equivalence class\nof corresponding models as a third entity. (Our primary focus is again\non categorical axiom systems, but the approach can be generalized.) It\nis this class that is now called \u201cthe natural number\nstructure\u201d. It is not a set, to be sure, but a proper class; but\nit can still be studied logico-mathematically.  Looked at from a\n\u201crelativist\u201d perspective, the new approach can also be\ndescribed as follows: Its core is to go from a particular, arbitrarily\nchosen system falling under a higher-order concept to the related\nequivalence class, i.e., the class of all systems isomorphic to it (in\nthe categorical case).  And we can think of this move as involving a\nkind of \u201cabstraction\u201d, specifically in the sense of the\n\u201cprinciple of abstraction\u201d in Russell (1903; also adopted\nby Rudolf Carnap and others). The result is a first form of\n\u201cabstractionist structuralism\u201d.\n\nThere is a second path we can take, resulting in a second form of\nabstractionist structuralism.  It too has played a role in the recent\nstructuralism debates; but, like the first, it can also be traced back\nfurther in time. Let us start again from a relevant higher-order\nconcept, or from the axiom system that defines it, together with an\narbitrarily chosen relational system falling under it (a set-theoretic\nsystem, say, possibly with urelements). The new suggestion is to\nproceed as follows: We \u201cabstract away from the particular nature\nof its elements\u201d so as to arrive at a novel, distinguished\nrelational system that deserves to be called \u201cthe natural\nnumbers\u201d (cf. Dedekind 1888, especially as interpreted in Reck\n2003). The intention is that the objects introduced by such\nabstraction only have structural properties, or better, only have\nthese essentially. Also, together these objects form a system\nisomorphic to the one from which we started (unlike the equivalence\nclass we just considered). Finally, it is the latter we now consider\nthe relevant abstract structure.\n\n\nIn several respects, this second abstractionist alternative is close\nto Shapiro\u2019s\nante rem structuralism (who occasionally appeals to\n\u201cabstraction\u201d himself, \ne.g., in Shapiro 1997); it is also close to Parsons\u2019 \nform of non-eliminative structuralism. Yet it neither involves a separate \nstructure theory \u00e0 \nla Shapiro nor an appeal to Parsons\u2019\nmeta-linguistic procedure. Instead, abstract structures are introduced \n\u201cby abstraction\u201d from\nmore concrete systems, e.g., from set-theoretic relational systems.\nThe relevant abstraction can be explicated further in\nterms of an \u201cabstraction \noperator\u201d and a corresponding\n\u201cabstraction principle\u201d. \nAnother comparison that suggests itself then is with the use of \nabstraction principles in contemporary neo-logicism. In fact, that \nconnection has already been explored in Linnebo & \nPettigrew (2014) and Reck (2018a). What we arrive at along such lines is an\nabstractionist form of non-eliminative structuralism. In contrast, the first \nalternative mentioned above is an abstractionist form of eliminative\nstructuralism. (Given their historical roots, these positions\nmight be labeled \u201cRussellian abstractionist \nstructuralism\u201d\nand \u201cDedekindian abstractionist \nstructuralism\u201d,\nrespectively; cf. Reck 2018a.)\n\nThe list of additional variants of structuralism does not end here\neither. Let us mention five further examples very briefly, without\ngoing into any details (and there may undoubtedly be more).  First,\nUri Nodelman and Edward Zalta have introduced a form of\nnon-eliminative structuralism, parallel to Shapiro\u2019s, which uses\nan \u201cobject theory\u201d inspired by Meinong to account for the\nabstract structures (Nodelman & Zalta 2014). Parallel to that, one\ncan use other fundamental theories for the introduction of abstract\nstructures, leading to further forms of non-eliminative\nstructuralism. As a second example, Hannes Leitgeb has described how\nto adapt graph theory for this purpose (Leitgeb forthcoming). Third,\nLeon Horsten has built on Kit Fine\u2019s theory of \u201carbitrary\nobjects\u201d to construct a parallel form of \u201cgeneric\nstructuralism\u201d (Horsten forthcoming).  Fourth, above we already\nmentioned Charles Chihara\u2019s \u201celiminative\u201d form of\nstructuralism, which is not identical with Hellman\u2019s (see\nChihara 2004).  And fifth, there is a whole family of\n\u201ccategorical forms of structuralism\u201d, based on a variety\nof axiom systems from category theory, that has become prominent\nrecently. \n\nWe will postpone our discussion of categorical structuralism to\nsection 3,\nboth because it is important mathematically, thus deserving treatment\nin a separate section, and because it is harder to compare to the other\nforms of structuralism. Before that, we want to offer a richer, more \ncomprehensive taxonomy for structuralist positions.\nThis taxonomy will be wide enough to encompass all the positions\nmentioned so far. But it will also point beyond them, starting with\nthe introduction of a basic dichotomy between\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d and \n\u201cmethodological\u201d \nstructuralism.\n",
