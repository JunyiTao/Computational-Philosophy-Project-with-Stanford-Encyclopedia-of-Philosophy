Proving an External Material World\n\nThe opening line of the Sixth Meditation makes clear its principal\nobjective: \u201cIt remains for me to examine whether material things\nexist\u201d (AT 7:71, CSM 2:50). At this juncture, the meditator\nperfectly knows of his own existence and of God\u2019s. It follows\nthat there\u2019s an external world with at least one object, namely,\nGod. However, the existence of an external material world\nremains in doubt. Establishing the existence of material bodies is not\na straightforward matter of perceiving them, because, in\nDescartes\u2019 view, \u201cbodies are not strictly perceived by the\nsenses\u201d (see\n Section 9.1).\n\nIn his eventual argument, Descartes\u2019 strategy for proving an\nexternal material world has two main parts: first, he argues for the\nexternality of the causes of sensation; second, he argues for\nthe materiality of these external causes. (Calling the ideas\nin question \u201csensations\u201d can seem circular, if one\nconceives of sensations as having a physiological component. But note\nthat for Descartes, \u201cwhat is called \u2018having a sensory\nperception\u2019,\u201d strictly encompasses only a mental aspect\nMed. 2, AT 7:29, CSM 2:19). From these two steps, it follows that there\nexists an external material world. Let\u2019s consider each phase of\nthe argument.\n7.1 Case for the Externality\nof the Causes of Sensation\n\nDescartes builds on a familiar line of argument in the history of\nphilosophy, itself appealing to the involuntariness of sensations.\nThe familiar argument is first articulated in the Third Meditation.\nSpeaking of his apparently adventitious ideas (sensations), the\nmeditator remarks:\n\nBut the chief question at this point concerns the ideas which I take\nto be derived from things existing outside me \u2026 I know by\nexperience that these ideas do not depend on my will, and hence that\nthey do not depend simply on me. Frequently I notice them even when I\ndo not want to: now, for example, I feel the heat whether I want to or\nnot, and this is why I think that this sensation or idea of heat comes\nto me from something other than myself, namely the heat of the fire by\nwhich I am sitting. (AT 7:38, CSM 2:26)\n\n\nThough some such involuntariness argument has convinced many\nphilosophers, the inference does not hold up to methodical doubt, as\nthe meditator explains:\n\nThen again, although these [apparently adventitious] ideas do not\ndepend on my will, it does not follow that they must come from things\nlocated outside me. Just as the impulses which I was speaking of a\nmoment ago seem opposed to my will even though they are within me, so\nthere may be some other faculty [of my mind] not yet fully known to\nme, which produces these ideas without any assistance from external\nthings; this is, after all, just how I have always thought ideas are\nproduced in me when I am dreaming. (Med. 3, AT 7:39, CSM 2:27)\n\n\nWe first examined this passage in regard to the Always Dreaming Doubt.\nThat sceptical hypothesis raises the problem of the existence of\nexternal things. For all I know, my \u201cwaking\u201d experiences \nare produced not by external things, but by processes similar to those\nproducing my dreams. This sceptical possibility explains why the\nfamiliar involuntariness argument fails: the inference presupposes\nexactly what is at issue \u2013 namely, whether involuntarily\nreceived sensory ideas are produced by external things, rather than\nby a subconscious faculty of my mind.\n\nMany philosophers have assumed that we lack the epistemic resources to\nsolve this sceptical problem. For example, Hume writes:\n\nBy what argument can it be proved, that the perceptions of the mind\nmust be caused by external objects \u2026 and could not arise either\nfrom the energy of the mind itself \u2026 or from some other cause\nstill more unknown to us? It is acknowledged, that, in fact, many of\nthese perceptions arise not from anything external, as in dreams,\nmadness, and other diseases. \u2026 It is a question of fact,\nwhether the perceptions of the senses be produced by external objects\n\u2026 But here experience is, and must be entirely silent.\n(Enquiry Sec. 12)\n\n\nInterestingly, Descartes would agree that experiential\nresources cannot solve the problem. By the Sixth Meditation, however,\nDescartes purports to have the innate resources he needs to\nsolve it \u2013 notably, innate ideas of mind and body. Among the\nmetaphysical theses he develops is that mind and body have wholly\ndistinct essences: the essence of thinking substance is pure thought;\nthe essence of body is pure extension. In a remarkable maneuver,\nDescartes invokes this distinction to refute the sceptical worry that\nsensations are produced by a subconscious faculty of the mind:\n\u201cnothing can be in me, that is to say, in my mind, of which I am\nnot aware,\u201d and this \u201cfollows from the fact that the soul\nis distinct from the body and that its essence is to think\u201d (13\nDec 1640 letter to Mersenne, AT 3:273, CSMK 165f). This result allows\nDescartes to supplement the involuntariness argument, thereby\nstrengthening the inference. For from the additional premise that\nnothing can be in my mind of which I am unaware, it follows\nthat if sensations were being produced by some activity in my mind,\nI\u2019d be aware of that activity on the occasion of its operation.\nSince I\u2019m not thus aware, it follows that the sensation\nI\u2019m having is produced by a cause external to my mind. As\nDescartes writes, this cause\n\n\u2026 cannot be in me, since clearly it presupposes no intellectual\nact [of awareness] on my part, and the ideas in question are produced\nwithout my cooperation and often even against my will. So the only\nalternative is that it is in another substance distinct from me\n\u2026 (Med. 6, AT 7:79, CSM 2:55)\n\n\nIt follows that my sensations are caused by external world objects\n\u2013 i.e., objects external to my mind. It remains to be shown that\nthese external causes are material objects.\n7.2 Case for the Materiality\nof the Causes of Sensation\n\nOn Descartes\u2019 analysis, there are three possible options for the\nkind of external thing causing sensations:\n\nGod\nMaterial/corporeal substance\nSome other created substance\n\n\nThat is, the cause is either infinite substance (God), or finite\nsubstance; and if finite, then either corporeal, or something else.\nDescartes thinks he eliminates options (a) and (c) by appeal to God\nbeing no deceiver:\n\nBut since God is not a deceiver, it is quite clear that he does not\ntransmit the ideas to me either directly from himself, or indirectly,\nvia some creature [other than corporeal substance] \u2026 For God\nhas given me no faculty at all for recognizing any such\nsource for these ideas; on the contrary, he has given me a great\npropensity to believe that they are produced by corporeal things.\nIt follows that corporeal things exist. (Med. 6, AT 7:79f, CSM 2:55;\nitalics added)\n\n\nThis is a problematic passage. The \u201cgreat propensity\u201d\nhere cited is not the irresistible compulsion of clear and distinct\nperception. (If it were, the conclusion that sensation is caused by\nmaterial objects would follow straightaway from this clear and\ndistinct perception, via the C&D Rule.) But unless each step of\nthe argument is clearly and distinctly perceived, Descartes should not\nbe making the argument. Adding to the difficulties of the passage, he\nexpressly cites the conclusion as following from the fact that\n\u201cGod is not a deceiver,\u201d implying that he thinks this\ninference is supported by a divine guarantee.\n\nOn one kind of interpretation, Descartes relaxes his epistemic\nstandards in the Sixth Meditation (cf. Schmitt 1986, 493f). He no\nlonger insists on perfect knowledge, now settling for probabilistic\narguments. Though no decisive texts support the interpretation, it\ndoes find some support. For instance, in the Synopsis to the\nMeditations, Descartes writes of his Sixth Meditation\narguments:\n\nThe great benefit of these arguments is not, in my view, that they\nprove what they establish \u2026 The point is that in considering\nthese arguments we come to realize that they are not as solid or as\ntransparent as the arguments which lead us to knowledge of our own\nminds and of God \u2026 (AT 7:15f, CSM 2:11)\n\n\nThe remark can be read as a concession that the Sixth Meditation\narguments are weaker than the earlier arguments about minds and God\n\u2013 that these later arguments do not \u201cprove what they\nestablish.\u201d Of course, one need not read the remark this way.\nAnd other texts are unfavorable to this interpretation. For example,\nin the opening paragraphs of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes considers\na probabilistic argument for the existence of external bodies. Though\nhe accepts the proposed account as offering the best explanation, he\nnonetheless dismisses it for the express reason that it grounds\n\u201conly a probability\u201d \u2013 it does not provide the\n\u201cbasis for a necessary inference that some body exists\u201d\n(AT 7:73, CSM 2:51). This is a puzzling dismissal, assuming Descartes\nhas relaxed his standards to probable inference.\n\nThe relaxed standards interpretation falls short for another reason.\nIt leaves unexplained why Descartes cites a divine guarantee for the\nconclusion that sensations are caused by material objects.\n\nOn another kind of interpretation, the troubling passage appealing to\na \u201cgreat propensity\u201d does not mark a relaxing of epistemic\nstandards. Instead, Descartes is extending the implications of his\ndiscussion of theodicy in the Fourth Meditation to encompass further\ncases of natural belief \u2013 such beliefs deriving from our\nGod-given cognitive nature. It was noted above\n (Section 5.2)\n that Descartes thinks the divine guarantee of the C&D Rule\nfollows, in part, from the fact that God wouldn\u2019t allow us to be\nmistaken when our assent is a natural consequence of our God-given\ncognitive nature. Suppose Descartes holds that there are further cases\nin which an all-perfect God would not allow us to be in error, in part\nbecause the beliefs in question arise naturally from our God-given\ncognitive nature. And suppose the further cases involve a\nnatural propensity to believe which cannot be\ncorrected by our cognitive faculties. Given these assumptions,\nthe resulting rule for truth would look something like the\nfollowing:\n\nI am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a natural propensity to\nbelieve, and (ii) God provided me no faculty by which to correct a\nfalse such belief.\n\n\nThis rule is more expansive than the C&D Rule, in that it\nlicenses more kinds of judgments. Clauses (i) and (ii) are tailored to\nthe problematic passage wherein, as we\u2019ve seen, Descartes\ninvokes two conditions: \u201cGod has given me no faculty at all\nfor recognizing any such source for these ideas; on the contrary,\nhe has given me a great propensity to believe that they are\nproduced by corporeal things.\u201d If this is on the right\ninterpretive track, then Descartes needs some way to justify this\nrule. Assuming a proof similar in structure to the proof of the\nC&D Rule, the justification might run as follows:\n\nThere is an all-perfect God.\nAn all-perfect God cannot allow me to be in error in cases in\nwhich (i) I have a natural propensity to believe, and (ii) God\nprovided me no faculty by which to correct a false such belief.\nTherefore, I am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a\nnatural propensity to believe, and (ii) God provided me no faculty\nby which to correct a false such belief.\n\n\nIf Descartes affirms premise 2, it explains why he thinks he\u2019s\nentitled to this more expansive rule, and without relaxing his\nepistemic standards. Indeed, a number of texts indicate that he\nholds some version of premise 2. The relevant Sixth Meditation\npassage states that from \u201cthe very fact that God is not a \ndeceiver\u201d there is a \u201cconsequent impossibility of there \nbeing any falsity in my opinions which cannot be corrected by some \nother faculty supplied by God\u201d (AT 7:80, CSM 2:55f). Another \npassage adds that we would be \u201cdoing God an injustice\u201d\nif we implied \u201cthat God had endowed us with such an imperfect \nnature that even the proper use of our powers of reasoning allowed\nus to go wrong\u201d (Prin. 3:43, AT 8a:99, CSM 1:255).\nAnd in the Second Replies, Descartes addresses case of judgments\nthat \u201ccould not be corrected by any clearer judgements or by \nmeans of any other natural faculty,\u201d adding that \u201cin\nsuch cases I simply assert that it is impossible for us to be \ndeceived\u201d (Replies 2, AT 7:143f, CSM 2:102f). These passages\nmake a strong case that something like premise 2 is in play,\nindeed implying that God\u2019s benevolent nature entails a more\nexpansive rule of truth than the C&D Rule. (As will emerge,\nDescartes looks again to call on this more expansive rule\nin his effort to prove that he is not dreaming.)\n\nEarlier, we noted another apparent problem in the Sixth Meditation\npassage wherein Descartes concludes that the external cause of\nsensation is something corporeal. One of his premises cites a\ngreat propensity to believe, yet the propensity is not\nitself the irresistible compulsion of clear and distinct perception. \nDoes not the methodic procedure of the Meditations restrict \nDescartes to using clear and distinct premises? By way of reply, \ndistinguish (a) that my sensation has an external cause, and (b)\nthat I have a great propensity to believe my sensation has\nan external cause. In context, the meditator lacks clear and distinct \nperception of (a). However, the relevant premise of the argument (as \nopposed to its conclusion) is not (a), but (b). And there is no \nprincipled reason that the meditator cannot clearly and distinctly \nperceive this premise.\n\nA final observation. It goes regularly unnoticed that the conclusion\nof Descartes\u2019 argument for the existence of an external material\nworld leaves significant scepticism in place. Granting the success of\nthe argument, my sensations are caused by an external material world.\nBut for all the argument shows \u2013 for all the broader argument of\nthe Meditations shows, up to this point \u2013 my mind might\nbe joined to a brain in a vat, rather than a full human body.\nThis isn\u2019t an oversight on Descartes\u2019 part. It\u2019s all\nhe thinks the argument can prove. For even at this late stage\nof the project, the meditator has not yet established himself to be\nawake \u2013 a line of inquiry to which we now turn.\n\n(For further discussion of Descartes\u2019 effort to prove the\nexistence of an external material world, see Carriero 2009 [146ff],\nFriedman 1997, Garber 1992, and Newman 1994.)\n8. Perfect Knowledge of Being Awake\n\nBy design, the constructive arguments of the Meditations\nunfold even though the meditator remains in doubt about being awake.\nThis of course reinforces the ongoing theme that perfect knowledge\ndoes not properly encompass judgments of external sense. (The judgment\nthat an external material world exists is not strictly a judgment of\nexternal sense \u2013 as if knowing its existence simply by sensing\nit. Rather, as we\u2019ve seen, the judgment arises from an complex\ninference about the possible causes of sensations.) In the closing\nparagraph of the Sixth Meditation, Descartes revisits the issue of\ndreaming. He claims to show how, in principle \u2013 even if not\neasily in practice \u2013 it is possible to achieve perfect knowledge\nthat one is presently awake.\n\nA casual reading of that final paragraph might suggest that Descartes\noffers a naturalistic solution to the problem (i.e., a\nnon-theistic solution), in the form of a continuity test: since\ncontinuity with past experiences holds only of waking but not\ndreaming, checking for the requisite continuity provides a test for\nascertaining that one is awake. The following remarks can be read in\nthis way:\n\nI now notice that there is a vast difference between the two\n[\u201cbeing asleep and being awake\u201d], in that dreams are never\nlinked by memory with all the other actions of life as waking\nexperiences are. \u2026 But when I distinctly see where things come\nfrom and where and when they come to me, and when I can connect my\nperceptions of them with the whole of the rest of my life without a\nbreak, then I am quite certain that when I encounter these things I am\nnot asleep but awake. (AT 7:89f, CSM 2:61f)\n\n\nThis naturalistic \u201csolution\u201d prompts two obvious\ncriticisms, both raised by Hobbes in the Third Objections. First, the\nsolution runs contrary to Descartes\u2019 No Atheistic Perfect\nKnowledge Thesis: since the continuity test (on the naturalistic\nreading of it) does not invoke God, it thus appears, as Hobbes notes,\n\u201cthat someone can know he is awake without knowledge of\nthe true God\u201d (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Second, it seems that one\ncould dream the requisite continuity: one could \u201cdream\nthat his dream fits in with his ideas of a long series of past\nevents,\u201d thus undermining the credibility of the continuity test\n(AT 7:195, CSM 2:137).\n\nMirroring our discussion in\n Section 7.2,\n one kind of interpretation has Descartes relaxing his epistemic\nstandards. He\u2019s aware that the naturalistic solution does not\nstand up to methodic doubt, but he\u2019s not attempting to overcome\nthe Now Dreaming Doubt with perfect knowledge. A problem for this\ninterpretation is that it doesn\u2019t square with the following\nreply Descartes makes to Hobbes\u2019 first objection: \u201can\natheist can infer that he is awake on the basis of memory of his past\nlife\u201d (via the continuity test); but \u201che cannot know that\nthis criterion is sufficient to give him the certainty that he is not\nmistaken, if he does not know that he was created by a non-deceiving\nGod\u201d (Replies 3, AT 7:196, CSM 2:137). Evidently,\nDescartes\u2019 solution is not supposed to be available to the\natheist. Taken at face value, this reply rules out a relaxed standards\ninterpretation; it indeed rules out any interpretation involving a\nnaturalistic solution to the problem of dreaming.\n\nOn closer inspection, the Sixth Meditation passage puts forward not a\nnaturalistic solution, but a theistic one. The meditator\nfinally concludes that he\u2019s awake because, as the passage\nexplicitly reads, \u201cGod is not a deceiver\u201d (AT 7:90, CSM\n2:62).\n\nHow does his argument go? Recall, in the proof of the external\nmaterial world\n (Section 7.2),\n that Descartes mysteriously invokes the following (divinely\nguaranteed) truth rule:\n\nI am not in error in cases in which (i) I have a natural propensity to\nbelieve, and (ii) God provided me no faculty by which to correct a\nfalse such belief.\n\n\nThe dreaming passage looks to have Descartes again invoking this rule.\nThe passage opens with the meditator observing the following:\n\nI can almost always make use of more than one sense to investigate the\nsame thing; and in addition, I can use both my memory, which connects\npresent experiences with preceding ones, and my intellect, which has\nby now examined all the causes of error. Accordingly, I should not\nhave any further fears about the falsity of what my senses tell me\nevery day; on the contrary, the exaggerated doubts of the last few\ndays should be dismissed as laughable. This applies especially to\n\u2026 my inability to distinguish between being asleep and being\nawake. (AT 7:89, CSM 2:61)\n\n\nReferring to the worry that he\u2019s presently dreaming as\nexaggerated suggests that condition (i) is met \u2013 i.e.,\nsuggesting that the present circumstance includes a \u201cnatural\npropensity\u201d to believe he\u2019s awake. As such, he needs only\nto establish condition (ii), and he\u2019ll have a divine guarantee\nof being awake. Here, notice that an important theme of the above\npassage concerns the meditator\u2019s faculties for correcting\nsensory error \u2013 a theme suggestive of condition (ii). In\ncontext, Descartes\u2019 appeal to the continuity test is perhaps\nbest understood in conjunction with condition (ii). As the meditator\nsays (speaking of his apparently waking experience):\n\n[W]hen I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they\ncome to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with the\nwhole of the rest of my life without a break, then I am quite certain\nthat when I encounter these things I am not asleep but awake. And I\nought not to have even the slightest doubt of their reality if,\nafter calling upon all the senses as well as my memory and my\nintellect in order to check them, I receive no conflicting reports\nfrom any of these sources. For from the fact that God is not\na deceiver it follows that in cases like these I am\ncompletely free from error. (AT 7:90, CSM 2:62; italics added)\n\n\nCentral to the inference is the meditator\u2019s effort to check the\ncorrectness of his belief, by means of his various faculties. The\ncases like these to which Descartes refers look to be those\nwhere conditions (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. Recall what\nDescartes writes in conjunction with the proof of the external\nmaterial world: from \u201cthe very fact that God is not a\ndeceiver\u201d there is a \u201cconsequent impossibility of there\nbeing any falsity in my opinions which cannot be corrected by some\nother faculty supplied by God\u201d (AT 7:80, CSM 2:55f). Perhaps,\ntherefore, we can understand Descartes\u2019 theistic solution to the\nNow Dreaming Doubt as building on the same rule he employs in\nhis proof for the external material world.\n\nWhat about Hobbes\u2019s other objection \u2013 in effect, that one\ncould dream both (i) and (ii)? Descartes\u2019 response:\n\u201cA dreamer cannot really connect his dreams with the ideas of\npast events, though he may dream that he does. For everyone admits\nthat a man may be deceived in his sleep\u201d (AT 7:196, CSM 2:137).\nPerhaps Descartes thinks the situation with dreaming parallels that of\nwaking life: those who are sufficiently tired, or otherwise\nperceptually inattentive, \u201ccannot really\u201d perceive truths\nclearly and distinctly, though it may seem to them that they\ndo. Whether in waking or dreaming, the Fourth Meditation theodicy has\nGod allowing us to make judgment errors, provided that they are\ncorrectable. Descartes is committed to holding that when our\nperception is confused, we can in principle come to discover the\nconfusion \u2013 even if not easily. When we lack clear and distinct\nperception, we are at fault (not God) for any resulting judgments, in\npart because we can discover that our perception is confused.\nDescartes needs it that the same principle holds even while dreaming.\n(And again, nearly the entirety of the Meditations unfolds\nunder the supposition that, for all we know, we may presently be\ndreaming.) For the case at hand \u2013 i.e., the possibility of\nmistakenly judging that I\u2019m awake, while in a dream\n\u2013 Descartes needs it that we could, in principle, discover that\nwe\u2019re mistaken. Apropos of condition (ii), therefore, is whether\nGod has provided us a faculty by which to discover that we\u2019re\ndreaming, on occasions when we wrongly believe ourselves to be awake.\nEvidently, Descartes thinks so, as he tells Gassendi:\n\nWhen, for example, we are asleep and are aware that we are dreaming,\nwe need imagination in order to dream, but to be aware that we are\ndreaming we need only the intellect. (Replies 5, AT 7:358f, CSM 2:248)\n\n\nImportantly, Descartes does not say we can easily correct the\nmistake of dreaming that we\u2019re awake. To the contrary,\nthe Sixth Meditation treatment of the Now Dreaming Doubt closes with a\nconcession that his solution is perhaps more theoretical than\npractical:\n\nBut since the pressure of things to be done does not always allow us\nto stop and make such a meticulous check, it must be admitted that in\nthis human life we are often liable to make mistakes about particular\nthings, and we must acknowledge the weakness of our nature. (AT 7:90,\nCSM 2:62)\n\n\nThus the importance of Descartes\u2019 First Meditation remark that\n\u201cno danger or error will result\u201d from the program of\nmethodical doubt, \u201cbecause the task now in hand does not involve\naction\u201d (AT 7:22, CSM 2:15). Methodical doubt should not be\napplied to practical matters. Prudence dictates that when making\npractical decisions I should assume I\u2019m awake, even if I\ndon\u2019t perfectly know that I\u2019m awake. Judgment errors made\nwhile mistakenly assuming I\u2019m awake do not have\nactual practical consequences, unlike those made while mistakenly\nassuming I\u2019m dreaming.\n\n(For further discussion, see Newman 1999, Williams 1978, and\nWilson 1978.)\n9. Self-Knowledge\n9.1 That Mind is Better-Known than Body\n\nDescartes holds that our judgments about our own minds are\nepistemically better-off than our judgments about bodies. In our\nnatural, pre-reflective condition, however, we\u2019re apt to confuse\nthe sensory images of bodies with the external things themselves, a\nconfusion leading us to think our judgments about bodies are\nepistemically impressive. The confusion is clearly expressed\n(Descartes would say) in G. E. Moore\u2019s famous claim to knowledge\n\u2013 \u201cHere is a hand\u201d \u2013 along with his more\ngeneral defense of common sense:\n\nI begin, then, with my list of truisms, every one of which (in my own\nopinion) I know, with certainty, to be true. \u2026 There\nexists at present a living human body, which is my body. This\nbody was born at a certain time in the past, and has existed\ncontinuously ever since \u2026 But the earth had existed also for\nmany years before my body was born \u2026 (1962, 32f)\n\n\nIn contrast, Descartes writes:\n\n[I]f I judge that the earth exists from the fact that I touch it or\nsee it, this very fact undoubtedly gives even greater support for the\njudgement that my mind exists. For it may perhaps be the case that I\njudge that I am touching the earth even though the earth does not\nexist at all; but it cannot be that, when I make this judgement, my\nmind which is making the judgement does not exist. (Prin.\n1:11, AT 8a:8f, CSM 1:196)\n\n\nMethodical doubt is intended to help us appreciate the folly of the\ncommonsensical position \u2013 helping us recognize that perception\nof our own minds is \u201cnot simply prior to and more certain\n\u2026 but also more evident\u201d than perception of our own\nbodies (Prin. 1:11, AT 8a:8, CSM 1:196). \u201cDisagreement\non this point,\u201d writes Descartes, comes from \u201cthose who\nhave not done their philosophizing in an orderly way\u201d; from\nthose who, while properly acknowledging the \u201ccertainty of their\nown existence,\u201d mistakenly \u201ctake \u2018themselves\u2019\nto mean only their bodies\u201d \u2013 failing to \u201crealize\nthat they should have taken \u2018themselves\u2019 in this context\nto mean their minds alone\u201d (Prin. 1:12, AT 8a:9, CSM\n1:196).\n\nIn epistemological contexts, Descartes purports to establish the\nmind-better-known-than-body doctrine with methodical doubt. For\nexample, while reflecting on his epistemic position in regard both to\nhimself, and to the wax, the Second Meditation meditator says: \n\nSurely my awareness of my own self is not merely much truer and more\ncertain than my awareness of the wax, but also much more distinct and\nevident. For if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I see\nit, clearly this same fact entails much more evidently that I myself\nalso exist. It is possible that what I see is not really the wax; it\nis possible that I do not even have eyes with which to see anything.\nBut when I see, or think I see (I am not here distinguishing the two),\nit is simply not possible that I who am now thinking am not something.\n(AT 7:33, CSM 2:22)\n\n\nFurther reasons might be helping to motivate Descartes\u2019 view.\nOn the kind of representational theory of perception that is widely \nattributed to him, our sense organs and nerves serve as literal mediating links in the causal chains generating sense perception:\nthey stand between (both spatially and causally) external things themselves, and the brain events occasioning our perceptual\nawareness (cf. Prin. 4:196). In veridical sensation, the \nobjects of immediate sensory awareness are not external bodies \nthemselves, nor are we immediately aware of the states of our sense \norgans or nerves. Rather, the objects of immediate awareness are \n\u2013 whether in veridical sensation, or in dreams \u2013 the \nmind\u2019s own ideas. Descartes indeed holds that the\nfact of physiological mediation helps explain delusional ideas,\nbecause roughly the same kinds of physiological processes that\nproduce waking ideas are employed in producing delusional ideas:\n\n[I]t is the soul which sees, and not the eye; and it does not see\ndirectly, but only by means of the brain. That is why madmen and those\nwho are asleep often see, or think they see, various objects which are\nnevertheless not before their eyes: namely, certain vapours disturb\ntheir brain and arrange those of its parts normally engaged in vision\nexactly as they would be if these objects were present.\n(Optics, AT 6:141, CSM 1:172; cf. AT 7:85ff and AT 11:248f)\n\n\nVarious passages of the Meditations lay important groundwork\nfor this theory of perception. For instance, one of the messages of\nthe wax passage is that sensory awareness does not reach to external\nthings themselves: \n\nWe say that we see the wax itself, if it is there before us, not that\nwe judge it to be there from its colour or shape; and this might lead\nme to conclude without more ado that knowledge of the wax comes from\nwhat the eye sees, and not from the scrutiny of the mind alone. But\nthen if I look out of the window and see men crossing the square, as I\njust happen to have done, I normally say that I see the men\nthemselves, just as I say that I see the wax. Yet do I see any more\nthan hats and coats which could conceal automatons? I judge\nthat they are men. (Med. 2, AT 7:32, CSM 2:21)\n\n\nDescartes thinks we\u2019re apt to be \u201ctricked by ordinary\nways of talking\u201d (ibid.). In ordinary contexts we \ndon\u2019t say that it seems there are men outside the \nwindow; we say that we see them. Nor, in such contexts,\nare our beliefs about those men apt to result from conscious, \ninferentially complex judgments, say, like this one: \u201cWell,\nI appear to be awake, and the window pane looks clean, and \nthere\u2019s plenty of light outside, and so on, and I thus\nconclude that I am seeing men outside the window.\u201d Even\nso, our ordinary ways of speaking and thinking often mislead. \nDescartes\u2019 view is that the mind\u2019s immediate perception \ndoes not, strictly speaking, extend beyond itself, to external\nbodies. This is an important basis of the mind-better-known-than-body \ndoctrine. In the concluding paragraph of the Second Meditation, \nDescartes writes:\n\nI see that without any effort I have now finally got back to\nwhere I wanted. I now know that even bodies are not strictly\n[proprie] perceived by the senses or the faculty of\nimagination but by the intellect alone, and that this perception\nderives not from their being touched or seen but from their being\nunderstood; and in view of this I know plainly that I can achieve an\neasier and more evident perception of my own mind than of anything\nelse. (AT 7:34, CSM 2:22f)\n\n\nThe understanding of ideas as the only immediate objects of\nawareness arises in a number of texts. In the Sixth Meditation,\nwhile discussing sense perception and our ideas of external things, \nDescartes writes that the mind\u2019s sensation extends strictly\nand immediately only to the ideas: \u201cthe ideas were, strictly \nspeaking, the only immediate objects of my sensory awareness\n[solas proprie et immediate sentiebam]\u201d (AT 7:75,\nCSM 2:52). The Second Replies defines thought \u201cto \ninclude everything that is within us in such a way that we are \nimmediately aware of it\u201d; it defines idea in\nterms of the \u201cimmediate perception\u201d that makes us \n\u201caware of the thought\u201d (AT 7:160, CSM 2:113). And\nin the Third Replies Descartes writes: \u201cI make it quite\nclear in several places \u2026 that I am taking the word \n\u2018idea\u2019 to refer to whatever is immediately perceived\nby the mind\u201d (AT 7:181, CSM 2:127).\n\nComplicating an understanding of such passages is that Descartes\nscholarship is divided on whether to attribute to him some version of\nan indirect theory of perception, or instead some version of a direct\ntheory. According to indirect perception accounts, in normal sensation\nthe mind\u2019s perception of bodies is mediated by an awareness of\nits ideas of those bodies. By contrast, direct perception\ninterpretations allow that in normal sensation the mind\u2019s ideas\nplay a mediating role, though this role doesn\u2019t have ideas\nfunctioning as items of awareness; rather, the objects of direct\nawareness are the external things, themselves. On both accounts, ideas\nmediate our perception of external objects. On direct theory accounts,\nthe mediating role is only a process role. By analogy, various brain\nprocesses mediate our perception of external objects, but in the\nnormal course of perception we are not consciously aware of\nthose processes; and likewise for the mind\u2019s ideas,\naccording to direct perception accounts. On one recent version of an\nindirect perception interpretation, sensory ideas mediate our\nperception of the external bodies they\u2019re of, in much the same\nway that pictures (or other representational media) mediate our\nperception of what they portray (Newman 2009). More generally,\nDescartes seems to view all ideas as mental pictures, of a sort. As he\nwrites: \u201cthe term \u2018idea\u2019 is strictly\nappropriate\u201d only for thoughts that \u201care as it were the\nimages of things\u201d (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:25); he adds that\n\u201cthe ideas in me are like {pictures, or} images\u201d (Med. 3,\nAT 7:42, CSM 2:29). \n\nIndirect perception interpretations have figured prominently in the\nhistory of Descartes scholarship. A number of recent commentators,\nhowever, have challenged this traditional view. For example,\nCarriero defends a direct perception interpretation: \u201cI don\u2019t read Descartes as holding that I am (immediately)\naware only of my sensory ideas and only subsequently (and perhaps \nindirectly) aware of bodies or their qualities\u201d (2009, 25).\nThus on Carriero\u2019s reading, Descartes\u2019 broader argument \nrebutting our doubts about the external world is not to be understood \nas an effort to get on the other side (as it were) of our ideas:\n\nThe argument (as I understand it) is not intended to get us from a\nrealm of inner mental objects (\u201csensory ideas\u201d) to some\nother realm of outer, physical objects (\u201cbodies\u201d); rather,\nit is to confirm our instinctive feeling that we have been receiving\ninformation (\u201cdirectly\u201d) from outer objects, bodies, all\nalong. (2009, 26)\n\n\n(For further discussion of Descartes\u2019 theory of ideas and\nperception, see Carriero 2009, Chappell 1986, Cunning 2010,\nHoffman 1996 and 2009, Jolley 1990, Nadler 2006, Nelson 1997, \nNewman 2009, 2011, and Smith 2014.)\n9.2 Whether We Perfectly Know Our Own Minds\n\nWe have seen that the proper use of our cognitive faculties requires\nus to withhold assent except when our perception is clear and distinct\n\u2013 indeed, that forming judgments in accord with the C&D Rule\nprovides the only guarantee of truth. Let\u2019s apply this standard\nto introspective judgments. Suppose that the present contents of my \nmind include a confused array of ideas \u2013 say, a confused \nassemblage of auditory ideas, or color ideas, or perhaps I am\npresently flooded with a confused assortment of ideas of emotion.\nIn such cases, the proper use of my faculties requires me to withhold \njudgment about the present state of my mind.\n\nIt is surprising, therefore, to learn that on the standard view in\nDescartes scholarship, he holds a strong view of privileged access\nguaranteeing the truth of all introspective judgments about\nthe present contents of our own minds. The usual result is an\ninfallibility thesis whereby judgments about our own mental states\ncannot be mistaken if based on introspective awareness: if\nI seem to be in mental state x, then I am\nin x. (A variety of related doctrines are also sometimes\nattributed to him, including the indubitability of the mental\n\u2013 roughly, that introspective judgments are indubitable;\nand omniscience with respect to the mental \u2013 roughly,\nthat one has knowledge of every true proposition about one\u2019s own\npresent contents of consciousness. There is some variation in the way\nthese doctrines are formulated in the literature.)\n\nAt least two lines of argument are widely cited in support of this\nstandard interpretation. One draws on the transparency doctrine. The\nother draws on texts interpreted as providing support. Let\u2019s \nexamine both.\n\nThe transparency doctrine has it that we are aware of everything\noccurring in our minds \u2013 this, a result of Descartes\u2019 view\nthat thinking constitutes the whole essence of\nmind:\n\nAs to the fact that there can be nothing in the mind, in so far as it\nis a thinking thing, of which it is not aware, this seems to me to be\nself-evident. For there is nothing that we can understand to be in the\nmind, regarded in this way, that is not a thought or dependent on a\nthought. \u2026 and we cannot have any thought of which we are not\naware at the very moment when it is in us. (Replies 4, AT 7:246, CSM\n2:171f)\n\n\nAdd to this that, unlike with external sensation, there is no\nintrospective appearance/reality gap, and there can seem to be no room\nfor introspective errors. Zeno Vendler explains:\n\nIf the mind, at any given time, is identical with a certain complex of\nthoughts \u2026 then the very idea of a medium between the\nmind and its thoughts is impossible from the outset. Accordingly, it\nis an understatement to say that the mind knows its thoughts;\nthe mind is these thoughts. (1972, 191)\n\n\nKenny adds:\n\nThe occurrence of thoughts is not open to doubt or error. Thoughts\ncannot occur without our knowing that they occur, and we cannot think\nthat a thought is occurring unless that thought actually is occurring.\n(1968, 72)\n\n\nIn opposition to this standard interpretation, note that from the\nfact that I have awareness of whatever is occurring in my mind, it\ndoes not follow that I have distinct awareness. If\nwhat\u2019s occurring in my mind is a confused muddle of ideas, then\nI\u2019ll be aware of a confused muddle of ideas. But in that case,\nforming a judgment about the present state of my mind is a recipe for\nerror \u2013 i.e., given the Fourth Meditation account of proper\njudgment. The situation is arguably better in cases in which I\nam experiencing fewer and simpler ideas; this is because such ideas\nare generally easier to render clear and distinct. Even so, such\nideas must actually be rendered as clear and distinct.\nNoteworthy is that Descartes writes, of \u201csensations, emotions\nand appetites,\u201d that \u201cwe are frequently wrong in our \njudgements concerning them\u201d; adding, that we can avoid such\nerrors \u201cprovided we take great care in our judgements\nconcerning them to include no more than what is strictly contained\nin our perception \u2013 no more than that of which we have inner\nawareness\u201d (Prin 1:66, AT 8a:32, CSM 1:216).\n\nConsider another case that seems at odds with the standard\ninterpretation. Were Descartes committed to introspective\ninfallibility, then he should say that we could never\nbe mistaken as to whether our occurring ideas are ideas of\nsensation, or instead ideas of imagination\noccurring in a dream. Yet as we\u2019ve seen, he takes\ndreaming-based scepticism utterly seriously.\n\nWhat about the textual line of argument regularly cited in support\nof the standard interpretation? Consider two Meditations\npassages that can seem to entail the infallibility thesis:\n\n\nI certainly seem to see, to hear, and to be warmed. This\ncannot be false; what is called \u201chaving a sensory\nperception\u201d is strictly just this, and in this restricted sense\nof the term it is simply thinking. (Med. 2, AT 7:29, CSM 2:19)\n\nNow as far as ideas are concerned, provided they are considered solely\nin themselves and I do not refer them to anything else, they cannot\nstrictly speaking be false; for whether it is a goat or a chimera that\nI am imagining, it is just as true that I imagine the former as the\nlatter. As for the will and the emotions, here too one need not worry\nabout falsity; for even if the things which I may desire are wicked or\neven non-existent, that does not make it any less true that I desire\nthem. (Med. 3, AT 7:37, CSM 2:26)\n\n\nPrima facie, it is plausible to take such passages to entail that if\nI seem to be having an idea of blue, or an idea of a noise,\nor of warmth, etc., then I am. Indeed, one might take such\npassages to convey that judgments to this effect \u201ccannot be\nfalse\u201d because introspective judgments are infallible.\nBut note the continuation of the second passage: \u201cThus the only\nremaining thoughts where I must be on my guard against making a\nmistake are judgements.\u201d This suggests that these passages can\nbe read in a very different way. Accordingly, a mere seeming\n\u201ccannot be false\u201d because it is not the kind of mental\nstate that could be false; on Descartes\u2019 view,\nfalsity arises not simply from the mind\u2019s awareness\nof its ideas, but from judgments \u2013 i.e., from acts of will \nassenting to those items of awareness. Read in this way, these\npassages anticipate the Fourth Meditation theory of judgment:\n\nNow all that the intellect does is to enable me to perceive the ideas\nwhich are subjects for possible judgements; and when regarded strictly\nin this light, it turns out to contain no error in the proper sense of\nthat term. (AT 7:56, CSM 2:39)\n\n\nArguably, Descartes\u2019 mind-better-known-than-body\ndoctrine is intended as a comparative rather than a\nsuperlative thesis. We have seen that, for Descartes, the\nonly superlative perceptual state is that of clarity and distinctness.\nThis suggests that the only guarantee of truth in our introspective \njudgments is, like all other judgments, that they be based on clear \nand distinct perception: if I clearly and distinctly perceive myself\nto be in mental state x, then I am in x.\n\n(For further discussion of related issues in Descartes, see Alanen \n2003, Broughton 2008, Curley 2006, Jolley 2013, Kenny 1968,\nLoLordo 2005, McRae 1972, Newman 2023, Nolan & Whipple 2005,\nVendler 1972, and Wilson 1978.)",
