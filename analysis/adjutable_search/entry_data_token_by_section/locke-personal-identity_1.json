Locke on Persons: What\u2019s Up for Debate\n\nThis section outlines some of the areas of Locke\u2019s text, and\naspects of Locke\u2019s view, that continue to be debated by\nhistorians of philosophy working to make sense of Locke\u2019s\npicture of persons and their persistence conditions today. As will\nsoon become clear, there is disagreement about almost every\naspect of Locke\u2019s discussion of persons, and even some of\nwhat has been presented thus far betrays a particular interpretive\nframework.\n\nOne of the overarching questions asked about Locke\u2019s\nEssay is how much it includes metaphysical exploration. Some\nthink that Locke\u2019s project is exclusively\nepistemological, citing (among other passages) the following as\nevidence for their view: In the Epistle to the Reader, Locke\ndescribes himself as an \u201cunderlabourer\u201d. Locke then goes\non to say,\n\n\nThis, therefore being my Purpose to enquire into the\nOriginal, Certainty, and Extent of humane Knowledge; together, with\nthe Grounds and Degrees of Belief, Opinion, and Assent; I shall not at\npresent meddle with the Physical Consideration of the Mind; or trouble\nmy self to examine, wherein its Essence consists, or by what Motions\nof our Spirits, or Alterations of our Bodies, we come to have any\nSensation by our Organs, or any Ideas in our Understandings;\nand whether those Ideas do in their Formation, any, or all of\nthem, depend on Matter, or no. These are Speculations, which, however\ncurious and entertaining, I shall decline, as lying out of my Way, in\nthe Design I am now upon. (L-N 1.1.2) \n\n\nUnder this reading, Locke is interested in determining what we can and\ncannot know by first determining how we come to have ideas, but what\nthis entails is determining which activities give rise to our ideas,\nrather than investigating the metaphysical nature of the thinking\nthing wherein these activities\u2014sensation and\nreflection\u2014take place. Likewise all other explorations within\nthe Essay eschew metaphysics.\n\nThose who read L-N 2.27 as part of a project which is purely\nepistemological see the claims that Locke makes about the persistence\nof persons as claims about what we can know about the\npersistence of persons. As Lex Newman puts it, \n\n\nLocke\u2019s broader aim is to clarify the conditions under which we\njudge that we are numerically the same with some earlier\nperson, not the conditions under which we strictly are the\nsame person. (2015: 90) \n\n\nUnder this kind of reading, Locke\u2019s claim that the identity of\nany person does not rest in the identity of substance (L-N 2.27.10 and\n23) amounts to the claim that if any person wants to determine whether\nthey are the same, they do not look to substance to find out. The idea\nis that because we have such an impoverished notion of substance in\ngeneral, we do not look to substratum to determine if we are the same\nperson over time in Locke\u2019s view.\n\nOther scholars tend to think that although Locke sets his task in the\nEssay as an epistemological one, he cannot help but dabble in\nsome metaphysics along the way. What has been presented (regarding the\nbasics of Locke\u2019s picture of persons) in this entry thus far\nfalls within this interpretive camp. This is why the imaginary cases\nthat Locke employs in L-N 2.27 have been described as giving the\nreader information about what makes it the case that a person\nis the same at time 2 as at time 1. According to this view, what Locke\nis giving us in L-N 2.27 are inter alia \u201cthe conditions\nunder which we strictly are the same person\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, within the interpretive camp that takes Locke to dabble\nin metaphysics, there is widespread debate, both at the macro and the\nmicro level. To start with the macro level: Some who fall into this\ncamp see Locke making metaphysical claims in various passages\nthroughout the text. Such scholars thus see what Locke is\ndoing in L-N 2.27 as very much in keeping with moves that he makes in\nother parts of the Essay (see Stuart 2013, for example).\nHowever, others see L-N 2.27\u2014and the metaphysics Locke is doing\ntherein\u2014as a significant break from the methodology\nthat Locke employs in the rest of the Essay. This is because\njust after Locke claims that his project in the Essay is an\nepistemological one (1.1.2), he makes clear that in this project, he\nis using the historical plain method, or roughly, the Baconian method\nof induction (see Nuovo forthcoming). Of this, Locke says,\n\n\n\u2026I shall imagine I have not wholly misimploy\u2019d my self in\nthe Thoughts I shall have on this Occasion, if, in this Historical,\nplain Method, I can give any Account of the Ways , whereby our\nUnderstandings come to attain those Notions of Things we have, and can\nset down any Measures of the Certainty of our Knowledge, or the\nGrounds of those perswasions, which are to be found amongst Men, so\nvarious, different, and wholly contradictory\u2026. (L-N 1.1.2) \n\n\nThose who see a tension between Locke\u2019s discussion of personal\nidentity and the rest of the Essay contend that the way in\nwhich Locke proceeds in L-N 2.27 not only includes metaphysics, but\nalso a reliance on thought experiments for data. Thus, rather than\nsurveying a number of instances, and drawing inferences from\nthere\u2014or utilizing the historical, plain method\u2014as he\nclaims to be doing throughout the Essay, Locke is doing\nsomething quite different in 2.27: He is employing imaginary cases\ninstead (see Antonia LoLordo 2012, for example).\n\nHowever, what the historical plain method amounts to for Locke, and\nwhether Locke\u2019s use of thought experiments in L-N 2.27 is in\ntension with this method is also the subject of debate. So too is\nwhether Locke uses thought experiments in 2.27 alone.\nAdditionally, some have questioned whether the exercises that Locke\nwalks readers through in 2.27 count as thought experiments at all (see\nKathryn Tabb 2018, for more on this). There are thus wide-ranging\ndebates about how to best describe 2.27 and the methodologies Locke\nemploys therein. There is also much disagreement regarding how to\nsquare these methodologies with the general description Locke gives of\nhis project in the Essay. Moreover, this is the case even\namongst those who are in agreement that Locke is doing\nmetaphysics in 2.27.\n\nOn top of this, there are deep and long-standing micro-level debates\namongst those who think Locke is giving us some metaphysics in L-N\n2.27. One such debate regards the implications of Locke\u2019s\nassertion that the identity of any person does not rest in the\nidentity of substance (2.27.10 and 23). Some scholars take\nLocke\u2019s assertion that the identity of any person does not rest\nin the identity of substance, and other similar claims, to be evidence\nthat Locke is a relativist about identity (see Stuart 2013, for\nexample). To get a sense of what this entails, it is helpful to\nconsider the contrast case: strict identity. If a philosopher holds a\nstrict identity theory, then she takes it that we can ask, \u201cIs\ny at time 2 the same as x at time 1?\u201d and arrive\nat a determinate answer. On the other hand, if a philosopher is a\nrelativist about identity, then she asserts that in response to the\nformer question, we have to ask \u201cSame what?\u201d So if we ask,\n\u201cIs Socrates the same?\u201d a relativist about identity thinks\nwe have to specify under which sortal term we are considering\nSocrates. Are we thinking about Socrates as a human being, or a body,\nor a soul (or something else altogether)?\n\nOn top of this, the relativist about identity thinks that an entity\nwho is of two sorts can persist according to one, while failing to\npersist according to the other. We might say that from one day to the\nnext, Socrates persists as the same human being, but not as the same\nbody. Thus when Locke says that a person can persist despite a change\nin substance, or a person can persist despite a change in soul, some\nscholars take Locke to be showing that he is a relativist about\nidentity. Relative identity readings were rather unpopular for some\ntime, but have experienced a resurgence as of late (see Stuart\n2013).\n\nStill, some think that attributing this kind of reading to Locke is\nanachronistic. Others take issue with the fact that under a relative\nidentity reading, there is, properly speaking, just one entity\ndescribed under different sorts. (What we call \u201cSocrates\u201d\ndoes not pick out a human being, and person, with a body and soul, but\nrather one thing, described in these different ways.) This is\nappealing for some, especially those who think that this is the only\nway to save Locke from violating the place-time-kind principle, which\nstipulates that no two things of the same kind can be in the same\nplace at the same time. But it lacks appeal for those who take Locke\nto be claiming that persons and the human beings who house them (for\ninstance) are\n distinct.[4]\n\nSome scholars take Locke\u2019s assertion that the identity of\nsubstance is neither required nor enough for the persistence of any\nperson to be evidence that persons are modes (or attributes), rather\nthan substances (or things themselves). Such scholars then turn to\nLocke\u2019s place-time-kind principle, for further evidence for\ntheir view. They take Locke\u2019s assertion that no two things of\nthe same kind can be in the same place at the same time to mean that\nno two substances of the same kind can be in the same place\nat the same time. Souls are thinking substances for Locke, and if\npersons are substances, they would count as such. Thus, persons cannot\nbe substances, for otherwise wherever there is a person and her soul\nthere are two thinking substances in the same place at the same time.\nThose who offer mode readings additionally turn to Locke\u2019s claim\nthat person is a \u201cforensic term\u201d and Locke\u2019s bold\nassertion that a demonstrative science of morality is possible as\nevidence that the term \u201cperson\u201d must be a mode term,\nrather than a substance term. This line of interpretation is popular\ntoday (see LoLordo 2012, Mattern 1980, Uzgalis 1990), but dates back\nto Edmund Law (1769).\n\nOther Locke scholars defend substance readings of Locke on persons.\nThey turn to Locke\u2019s claims about substance, power, and agency,\nto conclude that if an entity has any power whatsoever it has to be a\nsubstance. Persons have powers. Thus, persons have to be substances\nfor Locke (for arguments along these lines, see Gordon-Roth 2015,\nRickless 2015, Chappell 1990). They then have to explain what Locke\nmeans when he asserts that the identity of any person does not rest in\nthe identity of substance. Those who do not take the relative identity\npath usually end up working to get clear on what Locke could mean by\n\u201csubstance\u201d when he makes this claim. Many conclude that\nwhat Locke means is that the identity of any person does not depend\nupon the identity of the simple substances that compose or constitute\nher. There are numerous defenders of this position today (see Alston\nand Bennett 1988, Bolton 1994, Chappell 1990, and Uzgalis 1990). Thus\nquestions about two of the most basic features of Locke\u2019s\npicture of personal identity\u2014What is Locke\u2019s (general)\nview on identity?; and, What kind of entity is a person,\nexactly?\u2014are the subject of ongoing\n debate.[5]\n\nSo too are the most clearly stated aspects of Locke\u2019s view: the\nclaim that persons have consciousnesses, and the accompanying\nassertion that sameness of person rests in sameness of consciousness.\nWhat is consciousness for Locke? What does Locke mean by\n\u201csameness of consciousness\u201d? Answering these questions\nturns out to be difficult, since Locke does not say much about what he\ntakes consciousness to be (and we only know the persistence conditions\nof any entity, once we get clear on the nominal essence of that\nentity\u2019s kind, according to Locke). Nevertheless, answering\nthese questions is crucial to understanding Locke\u2019s theory of\npersonal identity since it is consciousness centered.\n\nSome scholars take Locke to be a strict memory theorist. In other\nwords, consciousness just is memory for Locke. As will become clear\nbelow, this reading dates back at least as far as Thomas Reid. Of\ncourse, it is the case that the way a person extends their\nconsciousness backward is via memory. It thus may seem as if the\nidentity of consciousness consists in memory, or that to have the same\nconsciousness as she who did x, one has to have a memory of\ndoing x, under Locke\u2019s view. Nevertheless, as Margaret\nAtherton points out, Locke talks at length about forgetfulness, and if\nconsciousness just is memory, then we cannot make sense of\nconsciousness at any given moment where a person is not\ninvoking memory (1983: 277\u2013278). Atherton then goes on to\ndevelop an account of consciousness that is analogous with\nLocke\u2019s conception of animal \u201clife\u201d.\n\nThe identity of consciousness is what allows for the persistence of\nany person, just as the identity of life is what allows for the\npersistence of any animal. \u201cIf we look at Locke in this\nfashion\u201d, Atherton argues, \n\n\nthen what he is saying is that what makes me different at this moment\nfrom any other person is that my thoughts are identical with\nmy consciousness of them. No one else can have my\nconsciousness any more than any organism can have my life. (Atherton\n1983: 283) \n\n\nA person, in Atherton\u2019s reading of Locke, is a single center of\nconsciousness, and so long as that single center of consciousness\npersists, the person persists.\n\nOther scholars hold what is called an \u201cappropriation\nreading\u201d (see Winkler 1991, Thiel 2011, LoLordo 2012). Under\nthis reading, what Locke means when he says that sameness of person\nconsists in sameness of consciousness, is that any person extends back\nonly to those mental events or acts which they take to be their\nown. In other words, the persistence of any person or self is\nbest seen in terms of the \u201csubjective constitution of the\nself\u201d (Winkler 1991: 204). There might be a worry that under\nthis kind of reading, Locke gives persons too much authority. That is,\na person could deny that she is the one who committed the crime, just\nbecause she doesn\u2019t see that act as her own. But, although the\n\u201cself has a certain authority over its own constitution\u201d,\nKenneth Winkler makes clear that \n\n\nit is important to realize that this authority is not consciously\nexerted. I do not willfully disown one act and appropriate another;\ninstead I accept what my consciousness reveals to me. There is also a\nsevere limit on that authority, imposed by the transitivity of\nidentity, \n\n\nwhich comes through, as Winkler notes, in Reid\u2019s\nobjection\u2014an objection which Winkler thinks sympathetic readers\nof Locke can answer and which is discussed in section 3 below (Winkler\n1991: 206).\n\nFrom these treatments it is still difficult to discern what\nconsciousness is for Locke, however. Shelley Weinberg works\nto give a robust picture of Locke\u2019s conception of consciousness\nin her recent book (2016). According to Weinberg, Locke uses the term\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d in two different ways: \n\n\n\u2026Locke seems to see consciousness as (1) a mental state\ninseparable from an act of perception by means of which we are aware\nof ourselves as perceiving, and (2) the ongoing self we are\naware of in these conscious states. (Weinberg 2016: 153) \n\n\nThe former is a momentary psychological state that allows for what\nWeinberg calls \n\n\na momentary subjective experience that the self presently perceiving\nis the same as the self that remembers having once had a past thought\nor action \n\n\nand captures the first-person experience of persisting over time\n(Weinberg 2016: 153). The latter is an \u201cobjective fact of an\nongoing consciousness\u201d (Weinberg 2016: 153). This sense of\nconsciousness is available from a third personal point of view, and\nfills in the gaps that any person\u2019s subjective experience might\nentail.\n\nThus, Weinberg contends that the identity, or continued existence, of\nconsciousness consists in a metaphysical fact, rather than\nappropriation. Nevertheless, Weinberg additionally argues that the\nfirst personal (conscious) experience of our own mental states,\nwhether those states are occurrent sensations, reflections, or via\nremembering is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of personal\nidentity. In other words, to have the awareness (or knowledge) of an\nongoing self\u2014or (2)\u2014we must have (1). Although there is a\nrange of interpretations of Locke on consciousness on the table,\nWeinberg\u2019s book, Consciousness in Locke, marks the\nfirst large-scale treatment of Locke\u2019s views on\n consciousness.[6]\n\nIn addition to the debate over what consciousness is, and what Locke\nmeans when he says that the identity of any person consists in the\nidentity of consciousness, there is ongoing debate about what\nLocke\u2019s stance is when it comes to what can give rise\nto consciousness. That is, there is ongoing discussion of what Locke\nmeans when he says that God could have superadded thinking to formerly\ninert systems of matter, and what Locke\u2019s actual\nposition is on the substantial nature of finite thinkers. There are\nthose who take Locke to be truly agnostic. Those who take this line of\ninterpretation remind readers of Locke\u2019s stated aims at the\nstart of the Essay (as quoted earlier), and the epistemic\nmodesty that Locke maintains throughout the text. But, there are\nothers who think that Locke overstates the probability that souls are\nimmaterial substances, so as not to ruffle the feathers of\nStillingfleet and other religious authorities. Some in the latter\ngroup think that Locke leans toward materialism. This raises questions\nabout how far Anthony Collins (discussed below) departs from the\nLockean picture, or the degree to which Locke anticipates later\nmaterialist pictures of\n persons.[7]\n At the very least, it can be said that Locke challenges the\nimportance that many philosophers place on the immaterial soul to\npersonhood and personal\n identity.[8]\n As might be expected, this was met with mixed reviews.\n",
