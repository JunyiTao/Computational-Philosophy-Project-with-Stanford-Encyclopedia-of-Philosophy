    "main_text": "\n1. What is Modal Logic?\n\nNarrowly construed, modal logic studies reasoning that involves the\nuse of the expressions \u2018necessarily\u2019 and\n\u2018possibly\u2019. However, the term \u2018modal logic\u2019 is\nused more broadly to cover a family of logics with similar rules and a\nvariety of different symbols.\n\nA list describing the best known of these logics follows.\n\n\nLogic\nSymbols \nExpressions Symbolized  \n\nModal Logic\n\\(\\Box\\)\nIt is necessary that \u2026 \n\n\n\\(\\Diamond\\)\nIt is possible that \u2026 \n\nDeontic Logic\n\\(O\\)\nIt is obligatory that \u2026 \n\n\n\\(P\\)\nIt is permitted that \u2026 \n\n\n\\(F\\)\nIt is forbidden that \u2026 \n\nTemporal Logic\n\\(G\\)\nIt will always be the case that \u2026 \n\n\n\\(F\\)\nIt will be the case that \u2026 \n\n\n\\(H\\)\nIt has always been the case that \u2026 \n\n\n\\(P\\)\nIt was the case that \u2026 \n\nDoxastic Logic\u00a0\n\\(Bx\\)\n\\(x\\) believes that \u2026 \n\nEpistemic Logic\u00a0\n\\(Kx\\)\n\\(x\\) knows that \u2026 \n\n2. Modal Logics\n\nThe most familiar logics in the modal family are constructed from a\nweak logic called \\(\\bK\\) (after Saul Kripke). Under the narrow\nreading, modal logic concerns necessity and possibility. A variety of\ndifferent systems may be developed for such logics using \\(\\bK\\) as a\nfoundation. The symbols of \\(\\bK\\) include \u2018\\({\\sim}\\)\u2019\nfor \u2018not\u2019, \u2018\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019 for\n\u2018if\u2026then\u2019, and \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 for the modal\noperator \u2018it is necessary that\u2019. (The connectives\n\u2018\\(\\amp\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(\\vee\\)\u2019, and\n\u2018\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)\u2019 may be defined from\n\u2018\\({\\sim}\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019 as is done\nin propositional logic.) \\(\\bK\\) results from adding the following to\nthe principles of propositional logic. \n\nNecessitation Rule: \u00a0\u00a0If \\(A\\) is a theorem of \\(\\bK\\), then\nso is \\(\\Box A\\).\n\nDistribution Axiom: \\(\\Box(A\\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow (\\Box\nA\\rightarrow \\Box B)\\).\n\n(In these principles we use \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 as metavariables ranging over formulas of the\nlanguage.) According to the Necessitation Rule, any theorem of logic\nis necessary. The Distribution Axiom says that if it is necessary that\nif \\(A\\) then \\(B\\), then if necessarily \\(A\\), then necessarily\n\\(B\\).\n\nThe operator \\(\\Diamond\\) (for \u2018possibly\u2019) can be defined\nfrom \\(\\Box\\) by letting \\(\\Diamond A = {\\sim}\\Box{\\sim}A\\). In\n\\(\\bK\\), the operators \\(\\Box\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\) behave very much like\nthe quantifiers \\(\\forall\\) (all) and \\(\\exists\\) (some). For example,\nthe definition of \\(\\Diamond\\) from \\(\\Box\\) mirrors the equivalence\nof \\(\\forall xA\\) with \\({\\sim}\\exists x{\\sim}A\\) in predicate logic.\nFurthermore, \\(\\Box(A \\amp B)\\) entails \\(\\Box A \\amp \\Box B\\) and\nvice versa; while \\(\\Box A\\vee \\Box B\\) entails \\(\\Box (A\\vee B)\\),\nbut not vice versa. This reflects the patterns exhibited by\nthe universal quantifier: \\(\\forall x(A \\amp B)\\) entails \\(\\forall xA\n\\amp \\forall xB\\) and vice versa, while \\(\\forall xA \\vee \\forall xB\\)\nentails \\(\\forall x(A \\vee B)\\) but not vice versa. Similar parallels\nbetween \\(\\Diamond\\) and \\(\\exists\\) can be drawn. The basis for this\ncorrespondence between the modal operators and the quantifiers will\nemerge more clearly in the section on\n Possible Worlds Semantics.\n\nThe system \\(\\bK\\) is too weak to provide an adequate account of\nnecessity. The following axiom is not provable in \\(\\bK\\), but it is\nclearly desirable. \n\\[\\tag{\\(M\\)}\n\\Box A\\rightarrow A\n\\]\n\n\n\\((M)\\) claims that whatever is necessary is the case. Notice that\n\\((M)\\) would be incorrect were \\(\\Box\\) to be read \u2018it ought to\nbe that\u2019, or \u2018it was the case that\u2019. So the presence\nof axiom \\((M)\\) distinguishes logics for necessity from other logics\nin the modal family. A basic modal logic \\(M\\) results from adding\n\\((M)\\) to \\(\\bK\\). (Some authors call this system\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\).)\n\nMany logicians believe that \\(M\\) is still too weak to correctly\nformalize the logic of necessity and possibility. They recommend\nfurther axioms to govern the iteration or repetition of modal\noperators. Here are two of the most famous iteration axioms:\n\n\\[\\tag{4}\n\\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Box A\n\\]\n \n\\[\\tag{5}\n\\Diamond A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond A\n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) is the system that results from adding (4) to \\(M\\).\nSimilarly \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) is \\(M\\) plus (5). In \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\), the\nsentence \\(\\Box \\Box A\\) is equivalent to \\(\\Box A\\). As a result, any\nstring of boxes may be replaced by a single box, and the same goes for\nstrings of diamonds. This amounts to the idea that iteration of the\nsame modal operator is superfluous. Saying that \\(A\\) is necessarily\nnecessary is considered a uselessly long-winded way of saying that\n\\(A\\) is necessary. The system \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) has even stronger\nprinciples for simplifying strings of modal operators. In\n\\(\\mathbf{S4}\\), a string of operators of the same kind can\nbe replaced by that operator; in \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\), strings containing\nboth boxes and diamonds are equivalent to the last operator in the\nstring. So, for example, saying that it is possible that \\(A\\) is\nnecessary is the same as saying that \\(A\\) is necessary. A summary of\nthese features of \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) follows.\n\n\\[\\tag{\\(\\mathbf{S4}\\)}\n\\Box \\Box \\ldots \\Box = \\Box \\text{ and }\n\\Diamond \\Diamond \\ldots \\Diamond = \\Diamond\n\\]\n \n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\tag{\\(\\mathbf{S5}\\)}\n00\\ldots \\Box &= \\Box \\text{ and } 00\\ldots \\Diamond = \\Diamond, \\\\\n &\\text{ where each } 0 \\text{ is either } \\Box \\text{ or } \\Diamond\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nOne could engage in endless argument over the correctness or\nincorrectness of these and other iteration principles for \\(\\Box\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond\\). The controversy can be partly resolved by recognizing\nthat the words \u2018necessarily\u2019 and \u2018possibly\u2019\nhave many different uses. So the acceptability of axioms for modal\nlogic depends on which of these uses we have in mind. For this reason,\nthere is no one modal logic, but rather a whole family of systems\nbuilt around \\(M\\). The relationship between these systems is\ndiagrammed in\n Section 8,\n and their application to different uses of \u2018necessarily\u2019\nand \u2018possibly\u2019 can be more deeply understood by studying\ntheir possible world semantics in\n Section 6.\n\nThe system \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (for the logician Brouwer) is formed by\nadding axiom \\((B)\\) to \\(M\\). \n\\[\\tag{\\(B\\)}\nA\\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond A\n\\]\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) can be formulated\nequivalently by adding \\((B)\\) to \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\). The axiom \\((B)\\)\nraises an important point about the interpretation of modal formulas.\n\\((B)\\) says that if \\(A\\) is the case, then \\(A\\) is necessarily\npossible. One might argue that \\((B)\\) should always be adopted in any\nmodal logic, for surely if \\(A\\) is the case, then it is necessary\nthat \\(A\\) is possible. However, there is a problem with this claim\nthat can be exposed by noting that \\(\\Diamond \\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) is\nprovable from \\((B)\\). So \\(\\Diamond \\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) should be\nacceptable if \\((B)\\) is. However, \\(\\Diamond \\Box A\\rightarrow A\\)\nsays that if \\(A\\) is possibly necessary, then \\(A\\) is the case, and\nthis is far from obvious. Why does \\((B)\\) seem obvious, while one of\nthe things it entails seems not obvious at all? The answer is that\nthere is a dangerous ambiguity in the English interpretation of\n\\(A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond A\\). We often use the expression\n\u2018If \\(A\\) then necessarily \\(B\\)\u2019 to express that the\nconditional \u2018if \\(A\\) then \\(B\\)\u2019 is necessary. This\ninterpretation corresponds to \\(\\Box(A\\rightarrow B)\\). On other\noccasions, we mean that if \\(A\\), then \\(B\\) is necessary:\n\\(A\\rightarrow \\Box B\\). In English, \u2018necessarily\u2019 is an\nadverb, and since adverbs are usually placed near verbs, we have no\nnatural way to indicate whether the modal operator applies to the\nwhole conditional or to its consequent. For these reasons, there is a\ntendency to confuse \\((B): A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond A\\) with\n\\(\\Box(A\\rightarrow \\Diamond A)\\). But \\(\\Box(A\\rightarrow \\Diamond\nA)\\) is not the same as \\((B)\\), for \\(\\Box(A\\rightarrow \\Diamond A)\\)\nis already a theorem of \\(M\\), and \\((B)\\) is not. One must take\nspecial care that our positive reaction to \\(\\Box(A\\rightarrow\n\\Diamond A)\\) does not infect our evaluation of \\((B)\\). One simple\nway to protect ourselves is to formulate \\(B\\) in an equivalent way\nusing the axiom \\(\\Diamond \\Box A\\rightarrow A\\), where these\nambiguities of scope do not arise.\n3. Deontic Logics\n\nDeontic logics introduce the primitive symbol \\(O\\) for \u2018it is\nobligatory that\u2019, from which symbols \\(P\\) for \u2018it is\npermitted that\u2019 and \\(F\\) for \u2018it is forbidden that\u2019\nare defined: \\(PA = {\\sim}O{\\sim}A\\) and \\(FA = O{\\sim}A\\). The\ndeontic analog of the modal axiom \\((M): OA\\rightarrow A\\) is clearly\nnot appropriate for deontic logic. (Unfortunately, what ought to be is\nnot always the case.) However, a basic system \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) of\ndeontic logic can be constructed by adding the weaker axiom \\((D)\\) to\n\\(\\bK\\). \n\\[\\tag{\\(D\\)}\n OA\\rightarrow PA\n\\]\n\n\nAxiom \\((D)\\) guarantees the consistency of the system of obligations\nby insisting that when \\(A\\) is obligatory, \\(A\\) is permissible. A\nsystem which obligates us to bring about \\(A\\), but doesn\u2019t\npermit us to do so, puts us in an inescapable bind. Although some will\nargue that such conflicts of obligation are at least possible, most\ndeontic logicians accept \\((D)\\).\n\n\\(O(OA\\rightarrow A)\\) is another deontic axiom that seems desirable.\nAlthough it is wrong to say that if \\(A\\) is obligatory then \\(A\\) is\nthe case \\((OA\\rightarrow A)\\), still, this conditional ought\nto be the case. So some deontic logicians believe that \\(D\\) needs to\nbe supplemented with \\(O(OA\\rightarrow A)\\) as well.\n\nControversy about iteration (repetition) of operators arises again in\ndeontic logic. In some conceptions of obligation, \\(OOA\\) just amounts\nto \\(OA\\). \u2018It ought to be that it ought to be\u2019 is treated\nas a sort of stuttering; the extra \u2018ought\u2019s do not add\nanything new. So axioms are added to guarantee the equivalence of\n\\(OOA\\) and \\(OA\\). The more general iteration policy embodied in\n\\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) may also be adopted. However, there are conceptions of\nobligation where distinction between \\(OA\\) and \\(OOA\\) is preserved.\nThe idea is that there are genuine differences between the obligations\nwe actually have and the obligations we should\nadopt. So, for example, \u2018it ought to be that it ought to be that\n\\(A\\)\u2019 commands adoption of some obligation which may not\nactually be in place, with the result that \\(OOA\\) can be true even\nwhen \\(OA\\) is false.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, see the entry on\n deontic logic.\n4. Temporal Logics\n\nIn temporal logic (also known as tense logic), there are two basic\noperators, \\(G\\) for the future, and \\(H\\) for the past. \\(G\\) is read\n\u2018it always will be that\u2019 and the defined operator \\(F\\)\n(read \u2018it will be the case that\u2019) can be introduced by\n\\(FA = {\\sim}G{\\sim}A\\). Similarly \\(H\\) is read \u2018it always was\nthat\u2019 and \\(P\\) (for \u2018it was the case that\u2019) is\ndefined by \\(PA={\\sim}H{\\sim}A\\). A basic system of temporal logic\ncalled \\(\\mathbf{Kt}\\) results from adopting the principles of \\(\\bK\\)\nfor both \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), along with two axioms to govern the\ninteraction between the past and future operators:\n\nNecessitation Rules:\n\nIf \\(A\\) is a theorem then so are \\(GA\\) and \\(HA\\). \n\nDistribution Axioms:\n\n\\(G(A\\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow(GA\\rightarrow GB)\\) and\n\\(H(A\\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow (HA\\rightarrow HB)\\)\n\nInteraction Axioms:\n\n\\(A\\rightarrow GPA\\) and \\(A\\rightarrow HFA\\)\n\nThe interaction axioms raise questions concerning asymmetries between\nthe past and the future. A standard intuition is that the past is\nfixed, while the future is still open. The first interaction axiom\n\\((A\\rightarrow GPA)\\) conforms to this intuition in reporting that\nwhat is the case \\((A)\\) will at all future times be in the past\n\\((GPA)\\). However \\(A\\rightarrow HFA\\) may appear to have\nunacceptably deterministic overtones, for it claims, apparently, that\nwhat is true now \\((A)\\) has always been such that it will occur in\nthe future \\((HFA)\\). However, possible world semantics for temporal\nlogic reveals that this worry results from a simple confusion and that\nthe two interaction axioms are equally acceptable.\n\nNote that the characteristic axiom of modal logic, \\((M): \\Box\nA\\rightarrow A\\), is not acceptable for either \\(H\\) or \\(G\\), since\n\\(A\\) does not follow from \u2018it always was the case that\n\\(A\\)\u2019, nor from \u2018it always will be the case that\n\\(A\\)\u2019. However, it is acceptable in a closely related temporal\nlogic where \\(G\\) is read \u2018it is and always will be\u2019, and\n\\(H\\) is read \u2018it is and always was\u2019.\n\nDepending on which assumptions one makes about the structure of time,\nfurther axioms must be added to temporal logics. A list of axioms\ncommonly adopted in temporal logics follows. An account of how they\ndepend on the structure of time will be found in the section\n Possible Worlds Semantics.\n \n\\[\\begin{align*}\nGA\\rightarrow GGA &\\text{ and } HA\\rightarrow HHA \\\\\nGGA\\rightarrow GA &\\text{ and } HHA\\rightarrow HA \\\\\nGA\\rightarrow FA &\\text{ and } HA\\rightarrow PA\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that certain combinations of past tense and\nfuture tense operators may be used to express complex tenses in\nEnglish. For example, \\(FPA\\), corresponds to sentence \\(A\\) in the\nfuture perfect tense (as in \u201820 seconds from now the light will\nhave changed\u2019). Similarly, \\(PPA\\) expresses the past perfect\ntense.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, see the entry on\n temporal logic.\n5. Conditional and Relevance Logics\n\nThe founder of modal logic, C. I. Lewis, defined a series of modal\nlogics which did not have \\(\\Box\\) as a primitive symbol. Lewis was\nconcerned to develop a logic of conditionals that was free of the so\ncalled Paradoxes of Material Implication, namely the classical\ntheorems \\(A\\rightarrow({\\sim}A\\rightarrow B)\\) and\n\\(B\\rightarrow(A\\rightarrow B)\\). He introduced the symbol\n\\(\\fishhook\\) for \u201cstrict implication\u201d and developed\nlogics where neither \\(A\\fishhook ({\\sim}A\\fishhook B)\\) nor\n\\(B\\fishhook (A\\fishhook B)\\) is provable. The modern practice has\nbeen to define \\(A\\fishhook B\\) by \\(\\Box(A\\rightarrow B)\\) and use\nmodal logics governing \\(\\Box\\) to obtain similar results. However,\nthe provability of such formulas as \\((A \\amp{\\sim}A)\\fishhook B\\) in\nsuch logics seems at odds with concern for the paradoxes. Anderson and\nBelnap (1975) have developed systems \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) (for Relevance\nLogic) and \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) (for Entailment) which are designed to\novercome such difficulties. These systems require revision of the\nstandard systems of propositional logic. (See Mares (2004) and the\nentry on\n relevance logic.)\n\nDavid Lewis (1973), Robert Stalnaker (1968), and others have developed\n conditional logics\n to handle counterfactual expressions, that is, expressions of the\nform \u2018if \\(A\\) were to happen then \\(B\\) would\nhappen\u2019. (Kvart (1980) is another good source on the topic.)\nCounterfactual logics differ from those based on strict implication\nbecause the former reject while the latter accept contraposition.\n6. Possible Worlds Semantics\n\nThe purpose of logic is to characterize the difference between valid\nand invalid arguments. A logical system for a language is a set of\naxioms and rules designed to prove exactly the valid\narguments statable in the language. Creating such a logic may be a\ndifficult task. The logician must make sure that the system is\nsound, i.e. that every argument proven using the rules and\naxioms is in fact valid. Furthermore, the system should be\ncomplete, meaning that every valid argument has a proof in\nthe system. Demonstrating soundness and completeness of formal systems\nis one of a logician\u2019s central concern. \n\nSuch a demonstration cannot get underway until the concept of validity\nis defined rigorously. Formal semantics for a logic provides a\ndefinition of validity by characterizing the truth behavior of the\nsentences of the system. In propositional logic, validity can be\ndefined using truth tables. A valid argument is simply one where every\ntruth table row that makes its premises true also makes its conclusion\ntrue. However, truth tables cannot be used to provide an account of\nvalidity in modal logics because there are no truth tables for\nexpressions such as \u2018it is necessary that\u2019, \u2018it is\nobligatory that\u2019, and the like. (The problem is that the truth\nvalue of \\(A\\) does not determine the truth value for \\(\\Box A\\). For\nexample, when \\(A\\) is \u2018Dogs are dogs\u2019, \\(\\Box A\\) is\ntrue, but when \\(A\\) is \u2018Dogs are pets\u2019, \\(\\Box A\\) is\nfalse.) Nevertheless, semantics for modal logics can be defined by\nintroducing possible worlds. We will illustrate possible worlds\nsemantics for a logic of necessity containing the symbols \\({\\sim},\n\\rightarrow\\), and \\(\\Box\\). Then we will explain how the same\nstrategy may be adapted to other logics in the modal family.\n\nIn propositional logic, a valuation of the atomic sentences (or row of\na truth table) assigns a truth value \\((T\\) or \\(F)\\) to each\npropositional variable \\(p\\). Then the truth values of the complex\nsentences are calculated with truth tables. In modal semantics, a set\n\\(W\\) of possible worlds is introduced. A valuation then gives a truth\nvalue to each propositional variable for each of the possible\nworlds in \\(W\\). This means the value assigned to \\(p\\) for world\n\\(w\\) may differ from the value assigned to \\(p\\) for another world\n\\(w'\\).\n\nThe truth value of the atomic sentence \\(p\\) at world \\(w\\) given by\nthe valuation \\(v\\) may be written \\(v(p, w)\\). Given this notation,\nthe truth values \\((T\\) for true, \\(F\\) for false) of complex\nsentences of modal logic for a given valuation \\(v\\) (and member \\(w\\)\nof the set of worlds \\(W)\\) may be defined by the following truth\nclauses.

According to (5), \\(\\Box A\\) is true (at a world \\(w)\\)\nexactly when \\(A\\) is true in all possible worlds. Given the\ndefinition of \\(\\Diamond\\) (namely \\(\\Diamond A =\n{\\sim}\\Box{\\sim}A)\\), the truth condition (5) insures that \\(\\Diamond\nA\\) is true just in case \\(A\\) is true in some possible\nworld. Since the truth clauses for \\(\\Box\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\) involve\nthe quantifiers \u2018all\u2019 and \u2018some\u2019\n(respectively), the parallels in logical behavior between \\(\\Box\\) and\n\\(\\forall x\\) and between \\(\\Diamond\\) and \\(\\exists x\\) noted in\nSection 2 will be expected.\n\nClauses \\(({\\sim}), (\\rightarrow)\\), and (5) allow us to calculate the\ntruth value of any sentence at any world on a given valuation. A\ndefinition of validity is now just around the corner. An argument is\n5-valid for a given set W (of possible worlds) if and only if\nevery valuation of the atomic sentences that assigns the premises\n\\(T\\) at a world in \\(W\\) also assigns the conclusion \\(T\\) at the\nsame world. An argument is said to be 5-valid iff it is valid\nfor every non-empty set \\(W\\) of possible worlds.\n\nIt has been shown that \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) is sound and complete for\n5-validity (hence our use of the symbol \u20185\u2019). The 5-valid\narguments are exactly the arguments provable in \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\). This\nresult suggests that \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) is the correct way to formulate a\nlogic of necessity.\n\nHowever, \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) is not a reasonable logic for all members of\nthe modal family. In deontic logic, temporal logic, and others, the\nanalog of the truth condition (5) is clearly not appropriate;\nfurthermore there are even conceptions of necessity where (5) should\nbe rejected as well. The point is easiest to see in the case of\ntemporal logic. Here, the members of \\(W\\) are moments of time, or\nworlds \u201cfrozen\u201d, as it were, at an instant. For simplicity\nlet us consider a future temporal logic, a logic where \\(\\Box\nA\\) reads: \u2018it will always be the case that\u2019. (We\nformulate the system using \\(\\Box\\) rather than the traditional \\(G\\)\nso that the connections with other modal logics will be easier to\nappreciate.) The correct clause for \\(\\Box\\) should say that \\(\\Box\nA\\) is true at time \\(w\\) iff \\(A\\) is true at all times in the\nfuture of \\(w\\). To restrict attention to the future, the\nrelation \\(R\\) (for \u2018earlier than\u2019) needs to be\nintroduced. Then the correct clause can be formulated as follows.\n\n\\[\\tag{\\(K\\)}\n v(\\Box A, w)=T \\text{ iff for every } w',\n \\text{ if } wRw', \\text{ then } v(A, w')=T.\n\\]\n\n\nThis says that \\(\\Box A\\) is true at \\(w\\) just in case \\(A\\) is true\nat all times after \\(w\\).\n\nValidity for this brand of temporal logic can now be defined. A\nframe \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) is a pair consisting of a\nnon-empty set \\(W\\) (of worlds) and a binary relation \\(R\\) on \\(W\\).\nA model \\(\\langle F, v\\rangle\\) consists of a frame \\(F\\) and\na valuation \\(v\\) that assigns truth values to each atomic sentence at\neach world in \\(W\\). Given a model, the values of all complex\nsentences can be determined using \\(({\\sim}), (\\rightarrow)\\), and\n\\((K)\\). An argument is \\(\\bK\\)-valid just in case any model whose\nvaluation assigns the premises \\(T\\) at a world also assigns the\nconclusion \\(T\\) at the same world. As the reader may have guessed\nfrom our use of \u2018\\(\\bK\\)\u2019, it has been shown that the\nsimplest modal logic \\(\\bK\\) is both sound and complete for\n\\(\\bK\\)-validity.\n7. Modal Axioms and Conditions on Frames\n\nOne might assume from this discussion that \\(\\bK\\) is the correct\nlogic when \\(\\Box\\) is read \u2018it will always be the case\nthat\u2019. However, there are reasons for thinking that \\(\\bK\\) is\ntoo weak. One obvious logical feature of the relation \\(R\\) (earlier\nthan) is transitivity. If \\(wRv\\) (\\(w\\) is earlier than \\(v)\\) and\n\\(vRu\\) (\\(v\\) is earlier than \\(u)\\), then it follows that \\(wRu\\)\n(\\(w\\) is earlier than \\(u)\\). So let us define a new kind of validity\nthat corresponds to this condition on \\(R\\). Let a 4-model be any\nmodel whose frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) is such that \\(R\\) is a\ntransitive relation on \\(W\\). Then an argument is 4-valid iff any\n4-model whose valuation assigns \\(T\\) to the premises at a world also\nassigns \\(T\\) to the conclusion at the same world. We use\n\u20184\u2019 to describe such a transitive model because the logic\nwhich is adequate (both sound and complete) for 4-validity is\n\\(\\mathbf{K4}\\), the logic which results from adding the axiom (4):\n\\(\\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Box A\\) to \\(\\bK\\).\n\nTransitivity is not the only property which we might want to require\nof the frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) if \\(R\\) is to be read\n\u2018earlier than\u2019 and \\(W\\) is a set of moments. One\ncondition (which is only mildly controversial) is that there is no\nlast moment of time, i.e. that for every world \\(w\\) there is some\nworld \\(v\\) such that \\(wRv\\). This condition on frames is called\nseriality. Seriality corresponds to the axiom \\((D): \\Box\nA\\rightarrow \\Diamond A\\), in the same way that transitivity\ncorresponds to (4). A \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)-model is a \\(\\bK\\)-model with a\nserial frame. From the concept of a \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)-model the\ncorresponding notion of \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)-validity can be defined just as\nwe did in the case of 4-validity. As you probably guessed, the system\nthat is adequate with respect to \\(\\mathbf{D}\\)-validity is\n\\(\\mathbf{KD}\\), or \\(\\bK\\) plus \\((D)\\). Not only that, but the\nsystem \\(\\mathbf{KD4}\\) (that is \\(\\bK\\) plus (4) and \\((D))\\) is\nadequate with respect to \\(\\mathbf{D4}\\)-validity, where a\n\\(\\mathbf{D4}\\)-model is one where \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) is\nboth serial and transitive.\n\nAnother property which we might want for the relation \u2018earlier\nthan\u2019 is density, the condition which says that between any two\ntimes we can always find another. Density would be false if time were\natomic, i.e. if there were intervals of time which could not be broken\ndown into any smaller parts. Density corresponds to the axiom \\((C4):\n\\Box \\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box A\\), the converse of (4), so for example,\nthe system \\(\\mathbf{KC4}\\), which is \\(\\bK\\) plus \\((C4)\\) is\nadequate with respect to models where the frame \\(\\langle W,\nR\\rangle\\) is dense, and \\(\\mathbf{KDC4}\\) is adequate with respect to\nmodels whose frames are serial and dense, and so on.\n\nEach of the modal logic axioms we have discussed corresponds to a\ncondition on frames in the same way. The relationship between\nconditions on frames and corresponding axioms is one of the central\ntopics in the study of modal logics. Once an interpretation of the\nintensional operator \\(\\Box\\) has been decided on, the appropriate\nconditions on \\(R\\) can be determined to fix the corresponding notion\nof validity. This, in turn, allows us to select the right set of\naxioms for that logic.\n\nFor example, consider a deontic logic, where \\(\\Box\\) is read\n\u2018it is obligatory that\u2019. Here the truth of \\(\\Box A\\) does\nnot demand the truth of \\(A\\) in every possible world, but\nonly in a subset of those worlds where people do what they ought. So\nwe will want to introduce a relation \\(R\\) for this kind of logic as\nwell, and use the truth clause \\((K)\\) to evaluate \\(\\Box A\\) at a\nworld. However, in this case, \\(R\\) is not earlier than. Instead\n\\(wRw'\\) holds just in case world \\(w'\\) is a morally acceptable\nvariant of \\(w\\), i.e. a world that our actions can bring about which\nsatisfies what is morally correct, or right, or just. Under such a\nreading, it should be clear that the relevant frames should obey\nseriality, the condition that requires that each possible world have a\nmorally acceptable variant. The analysis of the properties desired for\n\\(R\\) makes it clear that a basic deontic logic can be formulated by\nadding the axiom \\((D)\\) and to \\(\\bK\\).\n\nEven in modal logic, one may wish to restrict the range of possible\nworlds which are relevant in determining whether \\(\\Box A\\) is true at\na given world. For example, I might say that it is necessary that I\npay my bills, even though I know full well that there is a possible\nworld where I fail to pay them. In ordinary speech, the claim that\n\\(A\\) is necessary does not require the truth of \\(A\\) in all\npossible worlds, but rather only in a certain class of worlds which I\nhave in mind (for example, worlds where I avoid penalties for failure\nto pay). In order to provide a generic treatment of necessity, we must\nsay that \\(\\Box A\\) is true in \\(w\\) iff \\(A\\) is true in all worlds\nthat are related to \\(w\\) in the right way. So for an\noperator \\(\\Box\\) interpreted as necessity, we introduce a\ncorresponding relation \\(R\\) on the set of possible worlds \\(W\\),\ntraditionally called the accessibility relation. The accessibility\nrelation \\(R\\) holds between worlds \\(w\\) and \\(w'\\) iff \\(w'\\) is\npossible given the facts of \\(w\\). Under this reading for \\(R\\), it\nshould be clear that frames for modal logic should be reflexive. It\nfollows that modal logics should be founded on \\(M\\), the system that\nresults from adding \\((M)\\) to \\(\\bK\\). Depending on exactly how the\naccessibility relation is understood, symmetry and transitivity may\nalso be desired.\n\nA list of some of the more commonly discussed conditions on frames and\ntheir corresponding axioms along with a map showing the relationship\nbetween the various modal logics can be found in the next section.\n8. Map of the Relationships Between Modal Logics\n\nThe following diagram shows the relationships between the best known\nmodal logics, namely logics that can be formed by adding a selection\nof the axioms \\((D), (M)\\), (4), \\((B)\\) and (5) to \\(\\bK\\). A list of\nthese (and other) axioms along with their corresponding frame\nconditions can be found below the diagram.\n\n\n\nDiagram of Modal Logics\n\n\nIn this chart, systems are given by the list of their axioms. So, for\nexample \\(\\mathbf{M4B}\\) is the result of adding \\((M)\\), (4) and\n\\((B)\\) to \\(\\bK\\). In boldface, we have indicated traditional names\nof some systems. When system \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) appears below and/or to\nthe left of \\(\\mathbf{S}'\\) connected by a line, then \\(\\mathbf{S}'\\)\nis an extension of \\(\\mathbf{S}\\). This means that every argument\nprovable in \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is provable in \\(\\mathbf{S}'\\), but\n\\(\\mathbf{S}\\) is weaker than \\(\\mathbf{S}'\\), i.e. not all arguments\nprovable in \\(\\mathbf{S}'\\) are provable in \\(\\mathbf{S}\\).\n\nThe following list indicates axioms, their names, and the\ncorresponding conditions on the accessibility relation \\(R\\), for\naxioms so far discussed in this encyclopedia entry.\n\n\nName \nAxiom \nCondition on Frames\nR is\u2026  \n\n\\((D)\\)\n\\(\\Box A\\rightarrow \\Diamond A\\)\n\\(\\exists u wRu\\)\nSerial \n\n\\((M)\\)\n\\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\)\n\\(wRw\\)\nReflexive \n\n(4)\n\\(\\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Box A\\)\n\\((wRv \\amp vRu) \\Rightarrow wRu\\)\nTransitive \n\n\\((B)\\)\n\\(A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond A\\)\n\\(wRv \\Rightarrow vRw\\)\nSymmetric \n\n(5)\n\\(\\Diamond A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond A\\)\n\\((wRv \\amp wRu) \\Rightarrow vRu\\)\nEuclidean\n\n \n\n\\((CD)\\)\n\\(\\Diamond A\\rightarrow \\Box A\\)\n\\((wRv \\amp wRu) \\Rightarrow v=u\\)\nFunctional \n\n\\((\\Box M)\\)\n\\(\\Box(\\Box A\\rightarrow A)\\)\n\\(wRv \\Rightarrow vRv\\)\nShift\n\nReflexive \n\n\\((C4)\\)\n\\(\\Box \\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box A\\)\n\\(wRv \\Rightarrow \\exists u(wRu \\amp uRv)\\)\nDense \n\n\\((C)\\)\n\\(\\Diamond \\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond A\\)\n\\(wRv \\amp wRx \\Rightarrow \\exists u(vRu \\amp xRu)\\)\nConvergent \n\n\nIn the list of conditions on frames, and in the rest of this article,\nthe variables \u2018\\(w\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(v\\)\u2019,\n\u2018\\(u\\)\u2019, \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 and the quantifier\n\u2018\\(\\exists u\\)\u2019 are understood to range over \\(W\\).\n\u2018&\u2019 abbreviates \u2018and\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\u2019 abbreviates\n\u2018if\u2026then\u2019.\n\nThe notion of correspondence between axioms and frame conditions that\nis at issue here was illustrated in the previous section. The idea is\nthat when S is a list of axioms and F(S) is the corresponding set of\nframe conditions, then S corresponds to F(S) exactly when the system\nK+S is adequate (sound and complete) for F(S)-validity, that is, an\nargument is provable in K+S iff it is F(S)-valid. However, a stronger\nnotion of the correspondence between axioms and frame conditions has\nemerged in research on modal logic. (See\n Section 14\n below.) \n9. The General Axiom\n\nThe correspondence between axioms and conditions on frames may seem\nsomething of a mystery. A beautiful result of Lemmon and Scott (1977)\ngoes a long way towards explaining those relationships. Their theorem\nconcerned axioms which have the following form:  \n\\[\\tag{\\(G\\)}\n\\Diamond^h \\Box^i A \\rightarrow \\Box^j\\Diamond^k A\n\\]\n\n\nWe use the notation \u2018\\(\\Diamond^n\\)\u2019 to represent \\(n\\)\ndiamonds in a row, so, for example, \u2018\\(\\Diamond^3\\)\u2019\nabbreviates a string of three diamonds: \u2018\\(\\Diamond \\Diamond\n\\Diamond\\)\u2019. Similarly \u2018\\(\\Box^n\\)\u2019 represents a\nstring of \\(n\\) boxes. When the values of \\(h, i, j\\), and \\(k\\) are\nall 1, we have axiom \\((C)\\): \n\\[\\tag{\\(C\\)}\n\\Diamond \\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond A = \\Diamond^1\\Box^1 A \\rightarrow \\Box^1\\Diamond^1 A\n\\]\n\n\nThe axiom \\((B)\\) results from setting \\(h\\) and \\(i\\) to 0, and\nletting \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) be 1: \n\\[\\tag{\\(B\\)}\nA \\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond A = \\Diamond^0\\Box^0 A \\rightarrow \\Box^1\\Diamond^1 A\n\\]\n\n\nTo obtain (4), we may set \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) to 0, set \\(i\\) to 1 and\n\\(j\\) to 2: \n\\[\\tag{4}\n\\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box \\Box A = \\Diamond^0\\Box^1 A \\rightarrow \\Box^2\\Diamond^0 A\n\\]\n\n\nMany (but not all) axioms of modal logic can be obtained by setting\nthe right values for the parameters in \\((G).\\)\n\nOur next task will be to give the condition on frames which\ncorresponds to \\((G)\\) for a given selection of values for \\(h, i,\nj\\), and \\(k\\). In order to do so, we will need a definition. The\ncomposition of two relations \\(R\\) and \\(R'\\) is a new relation \\(R\n\\circ R'\\) which is defined as follows: \n\\[\nwR \\circ R'v \\text{ iff for some } u, wRu \\text{ and } uR'v.\n\\]\n\n\nFor example, if \\(R\\) is the relation of being a brother and \\(R'\\) is\nthe relation of being a parent then \\(R \\circ R'\\) is the relation of\nbeing an uncle (because \\(w\\) is the uncle of \\(v\\) iff for some\nperson \\(u\\), both \\(w\\) is the brother of \\(u\\) and \\(u\\) is the\nparent of \\(v)\\). A relation may be composed with itself. For example,\nwhen \\(R\\) is the relation of being a parent, then \\(R \\circ R\\) is\nthe relation of being a grandparent, and \\(R \\circ R \\circ R\\) is the\nrelation of being a great-grandparent. It will be useful to write\n\u2018\\(R^n\\)\u2019, for the result of composing \\(R\\) with itself\n\\(n\\) times. So \\(R^2\\) is \\(R \\circ R\\), and \\(R^4\\) is \\(R \\circ R\n\\circ R \\circ R\\). We will let \\(R^1\\) be \\(R\\), and \\(R^0\\) will be\nthe identity relation, i.e. \\(wR^0 v\\) iff \\(w=v\\).\n\nWe may now state the Scott-Lemmon result. It is that the condition on\nframes which corresponds exactly to any axiom of the shape \\((G)\\) is\nthe following: \n\\[\\tag{\\(hijk\\)-Convergence}\nwR^h v \\amp wR^j u \\Rightarrow \\exists x (vR^i x \\amp uR^k x).\n\\]\n\n\nIt is interesting to see how the familiar conditions on \\(R\\) result\nfrom setting the values for \\(h\\), \\(i\\), \\(j\\), and \\(k\\) according\nto the values in the corresponding axiom. For example, consider (5).\nIn this case \\(i=0\\), and \\(h=j=k=1\\). So the corresponding condition\nis \n\\[\nwRv \\amp wRu \\Rightarrow \\exists x (vR^0 x \\amp uRx).\n\\]\n\n\nWe have explained that \\(R^0\\) is the identity relation. So if \\(vR^0\nx\\) then \\(v=x\\). But \\(\\exists x (v=x \\amp uRx)\\) is equivalent to\n\\(uRv\\), and so the Euclidean condition is obtained: \n\\[\n(wRv \\amp wRu) \\Rightarrow uRv.\n\\]\n\n\nIn the case of axiom (4), \\(h=0, i=1, j=2\\) and \\(k=0\\). So the\ncorresponding condition on frames is \n\\[\n(w=v \\amp wR^2 u) \\Rightarrow \\exists x (vRx \\amp u=x).\n\\]\n\n\nResolving the identities, this amounts to:  \n\\[\nvR^2 u \\Rightarrow vRu.\n\\]\n\n\nBy the definition of \\(R^2, vR^2 u\\) iff \\(\\exists x(vRx \\amp xRu)\\),\nso this comes to: \n\\[\n\\exists x(vRx \\amp xRu) \\Rightarrow vRu,\n\\]\n\n\nwhich by predicate logic, is equivalent to transitivity: \n\n\\[\nvRx \\amp xRu \\Rightarrow vRu.\n\\]\n\n\nThe reader may find it a pleasant exercise to see how the\ncorresponding conditions fall out of hijk-Convergence when the values\nof the parameters \\(h\\), \\(i\\), \\(j\\), and \\(k\\) are set by other\naxioms.\n\nThe Scott-Lemmon results provides a quick method for establishing\nresults about the relationship between axioms and their corresponding\nframe conditions. Since they showed the adequacy of any logic that\nextends \\(\\bK\\) with a selection of axioms of the form \\((G)\\) with\nrespect to models that satisfy the corresponding set of frame\nconditions, they provided \u201cwholesale\u201d adequacy proofs for\nthe majority of systems in the modal family. Sahlqvist (1975) has\ndiscovered important generalizations of the Scott-Lemmon result\ncovering a much wider range of axiom types.\n10. Two Dimensional Semantics\n\nTwo-dimensional semantics is a variant of possible world semantics\nthat uses two (or more) kinds of parameters in truth evaluation,\nrather than possible worlds alone. For example, a logic of indexical\nexpressions, such as \u2018I\u2019, \u2018here\u2019,\n\u2018now\u2019, and the like, needs to bring in the linguistic\ncontext (or context for short). Given a context \\(c = \\langle s, p,\nt\\rangle\\) where \\(s\\) is the speaker, \\(p\\) the place, and \\(t\\) the\ntime of utterance, then \u2018I\u2019 refers to \\(s\\),\n\u2018here\u2019 to \\(p\\), and \u2018now\u2019 to \\(t\\). So in the\ncontext \\(c = \\langle\\)Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00 P.M. CST on\n4/3/\\(2014\\rangle\\) \u2018I am here now\u2019 is T iff Jim Garson is\nin Houston, at 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/2014.\n\nIn possible worlds semantics, a sentence\u2019s truth-value depended\non the world at which it is evaluated. However, indexicals bring in a\nsecond dimension \u2013 so we need to generalize again. Kaplan (1989)\ndefines the character of a sentence \\(B\\) to be a function\nfrom the set of (linguistic) contexts to the content of \\(B\\), where\nthe content, in turn, is simply the intension of \\(B\\), that is, a\nfunction from possible worlds to truth-values. Here, truth evaluation\nis doubly dependent \u2013 on both linguistic contexts and possible\nworlds.\n\nOne of Kaplan\u2019s most interesting observations is that some\nindexical sentences are contingent but at the same time analytically\ntrue. An example is (1).\n\n(1)  I am here now.\n\n\n\nJust from the meaning of the words, you can see that (1) must be true\nin any context \\(c = \\langle s, p, t\\rangle\\). After all, \\(c\\) counts\nas a linguistic context just in case \\(s\\) is a speaker who is at\nplace \\(p\\) at time \\(t\\). Therefore (1) is true at \\(c\\), and that\nmeans that the pattern of truth-values (1) has along the context\ndimension must be all Ts (given the possible world is held fixed).\nThis suggests that the context dimension is apt for tracking analytic\nknowledge obtained from the mastery of our language. On the other\nhand, the possible-worlds dimension keeps track of what is necessary.\nHolding the context fixed, there there are possible worlds where (1)\nis false. For example, when \\(c = \\langle\\)Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00\nP.M. CST on 4/3/\\(2014\\rangle\\), (1) fails at \\(c\\) in a possible\nworld where Jim Garson is in Boston at 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/2014. It\nfollows that \u2018I am here now\u2019 is a contingent analytic\ntruth. Therefore, two-dimensional semantics can handle situations\nwhere necessity and analyticity come apart.\n\nAnother example where bringing in two dimension is useful is in the\nlogic for an open future (Thomason, 1984; Belnap, et al., 2001). Here\none employs a temporal structure where many possible future histories\nextend from a given time. Consider (2).\n\n(2)  Joe will order a\nsea battle tomorrow. \n\n\nIf (2) is contingent, then there is a possible history where the\nbattle occurs the day after the time of evaluation and another one\nwhere it does not occur then. So to evaluate (2) you need to know two\nthings: what is the time \\(t\\) of evaluation, and which of the\nhistories \\(h\\) that run through \\(t\\) is the one to be considered. So\na sentence in such a logic is evaluated at a pair \\(\\langle t,\nh\\rangle\\).\n\nAnother problem resolved by two-dimensional semantics is the\ninteraction between \u2018now\u2019 and other temporal expressions\nlike the future tense \u2018it will be the case that\u2019. It is\nplausible to think that \u2018now\u2019 refers to the time of\nevaluation. So we would have the following truth condition:\n\n\\[\\tag{Now}\nv(\\text{Now} B, t)=\\mathrm{T} \\text{ iff } v(B, t)=\\mathrm{T}.\n\\]\n\n\nHowever this will not work for sentences like (3).\n\n(3)  At some point in\nthe future, everyone now living will be unknown. \n\n\nWith \\(\\mathrm{F}\\) as the future tense operator, (3) might be\ntranslated: \n\\[\\tag{\\(3'\\)}\n\\mathrm{F}\\forall x(\\text{Now} Lx \\rightarrow Ux).\n\\]\n\n\n(The correct translation cannot be \\(\\forall x(\\text{Now} Lx\n\\rightarrow \\mathrm{F}Ux)\\), with \\(\\mathrm{F}\\) taking narrow scope,\nbecause (3) says there is a future time when all things now living are\nunknown together, not that each living thing will be unknown in some\nfuture time of its own.) When the truth conditions for (3)\\('\\) are\ncalculated, using (Now) and the truth condition (\\(\\mathrm{F}\\)) for\n\\(\\mathrm{F}\\), it turns out that (3)\\('\\) is true at time \\(u\\) iff\nthere is a time \\(t\\) after \\(u\\) such that everything that is living\nat \\(t\\) (not \\(u\\)!) is unknown at \\(t\\). \n\\[\\tag{F}\nv(\\mathrm{F}B, t)=\\mathrm{T} \\text{ iff for some time } u\n \\text{ later than } t, v(B, u)=\\mathrm{T}.\n\\]\n\n\nTo evaluate (3)\\('\\) correctly, so that it matches what we mean by\n(3), we must make sure that \u2018now\u2019 always refers back to\nthe original time of utterance when \u2018now\u2019 lies in the\nscope of other temporal operators such as F. Therefore we need to keep\ntrack of which time is the time of utterance \\((u)\\) as well as which\ntime is the time of evaluation \\((t)\\). So our indices take the form\nof a pair \\(\\langle u, e\\rangle\\), where \\(u\\) is the time of\nutterance, and \\(e\\) is the time of evaluation. Then the truth\ncondition (Now) is revised to (2DNow). \n\\[\\tag{2DNow}\nv(\\text{Now} B, \\langle u, e\\rangle)=\\mathrm{T}\n \\text{ iff } v(B, \\langle u, u\\rangle)=\\mathrm{T}.\n\\]\n\n\nThis has it that the Now\\(B\\) is true at a time \\(u\\) of utterance and\ntime \\(e\\) of evaluation provided that \\(B\\) is true when \\(u\\) is\ntaken to be the time of evaluation. When the truth conditions for F,\n\\(\\forall\\), and \\(\\rightarrow\\) are revised in the obvious way (just\nignore the \\(u\\) in the pair), (3)\\('\\) is true at \\(\\langle u,\ne\\rangle\\) provided that there is a time \\(e'\\) later than \\(e\\) such\nthat everything that is living at \\(u\\) is unknown at \\(e'\\). By\ncarrying along a record of what \\(u\\) is during the truth calculation,\nwe can always fix the value for \u2018now\u2019 to the original time\nof utterance, even when \u2018now\u2019 is deeply embedded in other\ntemporal operators.\n\nA similar phenomenon arises in modal logics with an actuality operator\nA (read \u2018it is actually the case that\u2019). To properly\nevaluate (4) we need to keep track of which world is taken to be the\nactual (or real) world as well as which one is taken to be the world\nof evaluation.\n\n(4)  It is possible\nthat everyone actually living be unknown. \n\n\nThe idea of distinguishing different possible world dimensions in\nsemantics has had useful applications in philosophy. For example,\nChalmers (1996) has presented arguments from the conceivability of\n(say) zombies to dualist conclusions in the philosophy of mind.\nChalmers (2006) has deployed two-dimensional semantics to help\nidentify an a priori aspect of meaning that would support such\nconclusions.\n\nThe idea has also been deployed in the philosophy of language. Kripke\n(1980) famously argued that \u2018Water is H2O\u2019 is a posteriori\nbut nevertheless a necessary truth, for given that water just is H20,\nthere is no possible world where THAT stuff is (say) a basic element\nas the Greeks thought. On the other hand, there is a strong intuition\nthat had the real world been somewhat different from what it is, the\nodorless liquid that falls from the sky as rain, fills our lakes and\nrivers, etc. might perfectly well have been an element. So in some\nsense it is conceivable that water is not H20. Two dimensional\nsemantics makes room for these intuitions by providing a separate\ndimension that tracks a conception of water that lays aside the\nchemical nature of what water actually is. Such a \u2018narrow\ncontent\u2019 account of the meaning of \u2018water\u2019 can\nexplain how one may display semantical competence in the use of that\nterm and still be ignorant about the chemistry of water (Chalmers,\n2002).\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, see the entry on\n two-dimensional semantics.\n11. Provability Logics\n\nModal logic has been useful in clarifying our understanding of central\nresults concerning provability in the foundations of mathematics\n(Boolos, 1993). Provability logics are systems where the propositional\nvariables \\(p, q, r\\), etc. range over formulas of some mathematical\nsystem, for example Peano\u2019s system \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) for\narithmetic. (The system chosen for mathematics might vary, but assume\nit is \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) for this discussion.) G\u00f6del showed that\narithmetic has strong expressive powers. Using code numbers for\narithmetic sentences, he was able to demonstrate a correspondence\nbetween sentences of mathematics and facts about which sentences are\nand are not provable in \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\). For example, he showed there\nthere is a sentence \\(C\\) that is true just in case no contradiction\nis provable in \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) and there is a sentence \\(G\\) (the\nfamous G\u00f6del sentence) that is true just in case it is not\nprovable in \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\).\n\nIn provability logics, \\(\\Box p\\) is interpreted as a formula (of\narithmetic) that expresses that what \\(p\\) denotes is provable in\n\\(\\mathbf{PA}\\). Using this notation, sentences of provability logic\nexpress facts about provability. Suppose that \\(\\bot\\) is a constant\nof provability logic denoting a contradiction. Then \\({\\sim}\\Box\n\\bot\\) says that \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) is consistent and \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow\nA\\) says that \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) is sound in the sense that when it\nproves \\(A, A\\) is indeed true. Furthermore, the box may be iterated.\nSo, for example, \\(\\Box{\\sim}\\Box \\bot\\) makes the dubious claim that\n\\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) is able to prove its own consistency, and \\({\\sim}\\Box\n\\bot \\rightarrow{\\sim}\\Box{\\sim}\\Box \\bot\\) asserts (correctly as\nG\u00f6del proved) that if \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) is consistent then\n\\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) is unable to prove its own consistency.\n\nAlthough provability logics form a family of related systems, the\nsystem \\(\\mathbf{GL}\\) is by far the best known. It results from\nadding the following axiom to \\(\\bK\\): \n\\[\\tag{\\(GL\\)} \n \\Box(\\Box A\\rightarrow A)\\rightarrow \\Box A.\n\\]\n\n\nThe axiom (4): \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box \\Box A\\) is provable in\n\\(\\mathbf{GL}\\), so \\(\\mathbf{GL}\\) is actually a strengthening of\n\\(\\mathbf{K4}\\). However, axioms such as \\((M): \\Box A\\rightarrow A\\),\nand even the weaker \\((D): \\Box A\\rightarrow \\Diamond A\\) are not\navailable (nor desirable) in \\(\\mathbf{GL}\\). In provability logic,\nprovability is not to be treated as a brand of necessity. The reason\nis that when \\(p\\) is provable in an arbitrary system \\(\\mathbf{S}\\)\nfor mathematics, it does not follow that \\(p\\) is true, since\n\\(\\mathbf{S}\\) may be unsound. Furthermore, if \\(p\\) is provable in\n\\(\\mathbf{S} (\\Box p)\\) it need not even follow that \\({\\sim}p\\) lacks\na proof \\(({\\sim}\\Box{\\sim}p = \\Diamond p). \\mathbf{S}\\) might be\ninconsistent and so prove both \\(p\\) and \\({\\sim}p\\).\n\nAxiom \\((GL)\\) captures the content of Loeb\u2019s Theorem, an\nimportant result in the foundations of arithmetic. \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow\nA\\) says that \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) is sound for \\(A\\), i.e. that if \\(A\\)\nwere proven, A would be true. (Such a claim might not be secure for an\narbitrarily selected system \\(\\mathbf{S}\\), since \\(A\\) might be\nprovable in \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) and false.) \\((GL)\\) claims that if\n\\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) manages to prove the sentence that claims soundness\nfor a given sentence \\(A\\), then \\(A\\) is already provable in\n\\(\\mathbf{PA}\\). Loeb\u2019s Theorem reports a kind of modesty on\n\\(\\mathbf{PA}\\)\u2019s part (Boolos, 1993, p. 55). \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\)\nnever insists (proves) that a proof of \\(A\\) entails \\(A\\)\u2019s\ntruth, unless it already has a proof of \\(A\\) to back up that\nclaim.\n\nIt has been shown that \\(\\mathbf{GL}\\) is adequate for provability in\nthe following sense. Let a sentence of \\(\\mathbf{GL}\\) be always\nprovable exactly when the sentence of arithmetic it denotes is\nprovable no matter how its variables are assigned values to sentences\nof \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\). Then the provable sentences of \\(\\mathbf{GL}\\) are\nexactly the sentences that are always provable. This adequacy result\nhas been extremely useful, since general questions concerning\nprovability in \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) can be transformed into easier\nquestions about what can be demonstrated in \\(\\mathbf{GL}\\).\n\n\\(\\mathbf{GL}\\) can also be outfitted with a possible world semantics\nfor which it is sound and complete. A corresponding condition on\nframes for \\(\\mathbf{GL}\\)-validity is that the frame be transitive,\nfinite and irreflexive.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, see the entry on\n provability logic.\n12. Advanced Modal Logic\n\nThe applications of modal logic to mathematics and computer science\nhave become increasingly important. Provability logic is only one\nexample of this trend. The term \u201cadvanced modal logic\u201d\nrefers to a tradition in modal logic research that is particularly\nwell represented in departments of mathematics and computer science.\nThis tradition has been woven into the history of modal logic right\nfrom its beginnings (Goldblatt, 2006). Research into relationships\nwith topology and algebras represents some of the very first technical\nwork on modal logic. However the term \u2018advanced modal\nlogic\u2019 generally refers to a second wave of work done since the\nmid 1970s. Some examples of the many interesting topics dealt with\ninclude results on decidability (whether it is possible to compute\nwhether a formula of a given modal logic is a theorem) and complexity\n(the costs in time and memory needed to compute such facts about modal\nlogics). The next two sections describe examples of research in this\ntradition.\n13. Bisimulation\n\nBisimulation provides a good example of the fruitful interactions that\nhave been developed between modal logic and computer science. In\ncomputer science, labeled transition systems (LTSs) are commonly used\nto represent possible computation pathways during execution of a\nprogram. LTSs are generalizations of Kripke frames, consisting of a\nset \\(W\\) of states and a collection of \\(i\\)-accessibility relations\n\\(R_i\\), one for each computer process \\(i\\). Intuitively, \\(wR_i w'\\)\nholds exactly when \\(w'\\) is a state that results from applying the\nprocess \\(i\\) to state \\(w\\).\n\nThe language of poly-modal or dynamic logic introduces a collection of\nmodal operators \\(\\Box_i\\), one for each program \\(i\\) (Harel, 1984).\nThen \\(\\Box_i A\\) states that sentence \\(A\\) holds in every result of\napplying \\(i\\). So ideas like the correctness and successful\ntermination of programs can be expressed in this language. Models for\nsuch a language are like Kripke models save that LTSs are used in\nplace of frames. A bisimulation is a counterpart relation\nbetween states of two such models such that exactly the same\npropositional variables are true in counterpart states, and whenever\nworld \\(v\\) is \\(i\\)-accessible from one of two counterpart states,\nthen the other counterpart bears the \\(i\\)-accessibility relation to\nsome counterpart of \\(v\\). In short, the \\(i\\)-accessibility structure\none can \u201csee\u201d from a given state mimics what one sees from\na counterpart. Bisimulation is a weaker notion than isomorphism (a\nbisimulation relation need not be 1-1), but it is sufficient to\nguarantee equivalence in processing.\n\nIn the 70s, bisimulation had already been developed by modal logicians\nto help better understand the relationship between modal logic axioms\nand their corresponding conditions on Kripke frames. Kripke\u2019s\nsemantics provides a basis for translating modal formulas into\nsentences of first-order logic with quantification over possible\nworlds. Replace metavariables \\(A\\) in an axiom with open sentences\n\\(Ax\\), and translate \\(\\Box Ax\\) to \\(\\forall y(Rxy \\rightarrow\nAy)\\), in the result. (The translation for \\(\\Diamond Ax\\) is given by\n\\( \\exists y(Rxy \\amp Ay)\\).) For example, the translation of the\naxiom schema \\(\\Diamond \\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) comes to \\(\\exists y\n(Rxy \\amp \\forall z(Ryz \\rightarrow Az)) \\rightarrow Ax\\). This open\nformula with a free variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 reflects what\n\\(\\Diamond \\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) \u201csays\u201d in the language of\nfirst-order logic. Obviously the translations of modal formulas are\nspecial; most first-order formulas are not equivalent to the result of\ntranslating modal formulas in this way. The modal translations form a\nspecial subset of the predicate logic language, which delimits what\nmodal logic formulas can express. \n\nIs there any interesting way to characterize the expressive power of\nthe modal translations? The answer is that bisimulation serves exactly\nthat purpose. Van Benthem showed (Blackburn et al., 2001, p. 103) that\na first-order formula is equivalent to a modal translation exactly\nwhen its holding in a model entails that it holds in any bisimular\nmodel, and the idea easily generalizes to the poly-modal case. This\nsuggests that poly-modal logic lies at exactly the right level of\nabstraction to describe, and reason about, computation and other\nprocesses. (After all, what really matters there is the preservation\nof truth values of formulas in models, rather than the finer details\nof the frame structures.) Furthermore, the implicit translation of\nmodal logics into well-understood fragments of predicate logic\nprovides a wealth of information of interest to computer scientists.\nAs a result, a fruitful area of research in computer science has\ndeveloped with bisimulation as its core idea (Ponse et al.\n1995).\n14. Frame Validity and Incompleteness\n\nWork on modal logic in the 60s was primarily concerned with obtaining\ncompleteness results with respect to various conditions on the\naccessibility relation. However as research progressed into the 70s,\ndeeper connections were discovered concerning what modal axioms\nexpress about frames. A central idea in this work is the notion of\nframe validity, which differs from the kind of validity which was laid\nout in Section 6 above. There an argument was considered valid for a\nset of conditions \\(C\\) on frames exactly when for every model\n\\(\\langle W, R, v\\rangle\\) whose frame obeys \\(C\\), and every world\n\\(w\\) in \\(W\\), the truth of the premises at \\(w\\) entails the truth\nof the conclusion at \\(w\\). In short, model validity amounts to\npreservation of truth on every model. Frame validity, on the other\nhand, focuses more clearly on the frames of the model. A sentence is\nsaid to be valid on a frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) iff it is\ntrue in every world in any model with frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\).\nThen an argument is ruled frame valid for a set of conditions\n\\(C\\) on frames iff it preserves frame validity, that is, for every\nframe that obeys \\(C\\), if the premises are valid on that frame, then\nso is the conclusion.\n\nFrame validity appears a better way to understand what a modal axiom\nexpresses about frames. There are models that assign the axiom (M):\n\\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) true, even though its frame does not satisfy\nreflexivity - the corresponding frame condition for (M). That is\nbecause the valuation function for a model can be specially crafted so\nthat it does the work of ensuring that \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) is\ntrue. However, as we will soon see, if \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) is\nvalid for frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\), then it follows that\n\\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) is reflexive. By abstracting away from details\nabout the valuation function, one obtains better insight into the\nrelationship between axioms and frame conditions.\n\nThe concept of frame validity provides a basis for translating what\nmodal axioms express into sentences of a second-order language where\nquantification is allowed over one-place predicate letters \\(P\\).\nReplace metavariables \\(A\\) with open sentences \\(Px\\), translate\n\\(\\Box Px\\) to \\(\\forall y(Rxy \\rightarrow Py)\\), and close free\nvariables \\(x\\) and predicate letters \\(P\\) with universal\nquantifiers. For example, the predicate logic translation of the axiom\nschema \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) comes to \\(\\forall P \\forall x[\\forall\ny(Rxy\\rightarrow Py) \\rightarrow Px\\)]. (The basis for the\nquantification over the predicate letters P is that frame validity\nquantifies over all valuations of the propositional variables p, but\nvaluations over p are functions from the set of possible worlds to\ntruth values, and these can be likened to properties of worlds\nexpressed by p, namely the property that world w has when p is true\nthere.) \n\nGiven this translation for \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\), one may\ninstantiate the variable \\(P\\) to an arbitrary one-place predicate,\nfor example to the predicate \\(Rx\\) whose extension is the set of all\nworlds w such that \\(Rxw\\) for a given value of \\(x\\). Then one\nobtains \\(\\forall x[\\forall y(Rxy\\rightarrow Rxy) \\rightarrow Rxx\\)],\nwhich reduces to \\(\\forall xRxx\\), since \\(\\forall y(Rxy\\rightarrow\nRxy)\\) is a tautology. This illuminates the correspondence between\n\\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) and reflexivity of frames \\((\\forall xRxx)\\).\nSimilar results hold for many other axioms and frame conditions. The\n\u201ccollapse\u201d of second-order axiom conditions to first-order\nframe conditions is very helpful in locating how axioms correspond to\nframe conditions, and in obtaining completeness results for various\nmodal logics. For example, this is the core idea behind the elegant\nresults of Sahlqvist (1975), which are described in (Blackburn et al.,\n2001, Ch. 3, especially section 3.6).\n\nThe striking successes along these lines suggests that every modal\nlogic can be shown to be sound and complete with respect to the frame\nconditions that its axioms express. Unfortunately, this is not the\ncase. Some logics are incomplete for their frame conditions as is\nillustrated by the following example (Boolos, 1993 pp. 148ff). The\nprovability logic GL results from adding the axiom \\(\\Box(\\Box\nA\\rightarrow A) \\rightarrow \\Box A\\) to the basic modal logic K.\nSystem H results from adding the weaker axiom: \\(\\Box(\\Box A\n\\leftrightarrow A) \\rightarrow \\Box A\\) to K. GL is stronger than H as\nit is able to prove the standard axiom for S4: \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow\n\\Box\\Box A\\), but H is not. The problem is that GL and H express\nequivalent second-order conditions. That means in turn that H is\nincomplete, for it cannot prove a formula \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow\n\\Box\\Box A\\) which is in fact valid for the frames it expresses.\n\nSo from the frame validity perspective, there is no way to always\nconvert the second-order translation of an axiom into a first-order\nframe condition for which a given system is both sound and complete.\nThe reason is that if there were, both GL and H would have to be sound\nand complete with respect to the same first order condition C. But\nthat means (by soundness of GL) that \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box\\Box A\\)\nwould be frame valid for C, but not provable in H. The upshot is that\nin general, what modal logics express in the frame-validity paradigm\nmay be more powerful than what can be said in a first-order\nlanguage.\n15. Modal Logic and Games\n\nThe interaction between the theory of games and modal logic is a\nflourishing new area of research (van der Hoek and Pauly, 2007; van\nBenthem, 2011, Ch. 10, and 2014). This work has interesting\napplications to understanding cooperation and competition among agents\nas information available to them evolves. \n\nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma illustrates some of the concepts in game\ntheory that can be analyzed using modal logics. Imagine two players\nthat choose to either cooperate or defect. If both cooperate, they\nboth achieve a reward of 3 points, if they both defect, they both get\n1 point, and if one cooperates and the other defects, the defector\nmakes off with 5 points and the cooperator gets nothing. If both\nplayers are altruistic and motivated to maximize the sum of their\nrewards, they will both cooperate, as this is the best they can do\ntogether. However, they are both tempted to defect to increase their\nown reward from 3 to 5, leaving their opponent with nothing. On the\nother hand, if they are both rational, they may recognize that if\ndefection is the best strategy, their opponent will choose this as\nwell, leaving them with only 1 point. So unless there is enough trust\nbetween the players to motivate cooperation, they will be doomed to\nreceiving 1 point apiece. However, if each thinks the other realizes\nthis, they may be willing to risk cooperating anyway.\n\nAn extended (or iterated) version of this game gives the players\nmultiple moves, that is, repeated opportunities to play and collect\nrewards. If players have information about the history of the moves\nand their outcomes, new concerns come into play, as success in the\ngame depends on knowing their opponent\u2019s strategy and\ndetermining (for example) when he/she can be trusted not to defect. In\nmulti-player versions of the game, where players are drawn in pairs\nfrom a larger pool at each move, one\u2019s own best strategy may\nwell depend on whether one can recognize one\u2019s opponents and the\nstrategies they have adopted. (See Grim et. al., 1998 for fascinating\nresearch on Interated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemmas.) \n\nIn games like Chess, players take turns making their moves and their\nopponents can see the moves made. If we adopt the convention that the\nplayers in a game take turns making their moves, then the Iterated\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma is a game with missing information about the\nstate of play \u2013 the player with the second turn lacks\ninformation about what the other player\u2019s last move was. This\nillustrates the interest of games with imperfect information. \n\nThe application of games to logic has a long history. One influential\napplication with important implications for linguistics is Game\nTheoretic Semantics (GTS) (Hintikka et. al. 1983), where validity is\ndefined by the outcome of a game between two players, one trying to\nverify and the other trying to falsify a given formula. GTS has\nsignificantly stronger resources that standard Tarski-style semantics,\nas it can be used (for example) to explain how meaning evolves in a\ndiscourse (a sequence of sentences).\n\nHowever, the work on games and modal logic to be described here is\nsomewhat different. Instead of using games to analyze the semantics of\na logic, the modal logics at issue are used to analyze games. The\nstructure of games and their play is very rich, as it involves the\nnature of the game itself (the allowed moves and the rewards for the\noutcomes), the strategies (which are sequences of moves through time),\nand the flow of information available to the players as the game\nprogresses. Therefore, the development of modal logic for games draws\non features found in logics involving concepts like time, agency,\npreference, goals, knowledge, belief, and cooperation. \n\nTo provide some hint at this variety, here is a limited description of\nsome of the modal operators that turn up in the analysis of games and\nsome of the things that can be expressed with them. The basic idea in\nthe semantics is that a game consists of a set of players 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026, and a set of W of game states. For each player \\(i\\), there\nis an accessibility relation \\(R_i\\) understood so that \\(sR_i t\\)\nholds for states \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) iff when the game has come to state\n\\(s\\) player \\(i\\) has the option of making a move that results in\n\\(t\\). This collection of relations defines a tree whose branches\ndefine every possible sequence of moves in the game. The semantics\nalso assigns truth-values to atoms that keep track of the payoffs. So,\nfor example in a game like Chess, there could be an atom \\(\\win_i\\)\nsuch that \\(v(\\win_i, s)=T\\) iff state \\(s\\) is a win for player\n\\(i\\). Model operators \\(\\Box_i\\) and \\(\\Diamond_i\\) for each player\n\\(i\\) may then be given truth conditions as follows. \n\\[\\begin{align*}\nv(\\Box_i A, s) &=T \\text{ iff for all } t \\text{ in } W, \\text{ if } sR_i t, \\text{ then } v(A, t)=T. \\\\\nv(\\Diamond_i A, s) &=T \\text{ iff for some } t \\text{ in } W, sR_i t \\text{ and }v(A, t)=T.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nSo \\(\\Box_i A\\) \\((\\Diamond_i A)\\) is true in s provided that sentence\n\\(A\\) holds true in every (some) state that \\(i\\) can chose from state\n\\(s\\). Given that \\(\\bot\\) is a contradiction (so \\({\\sim}\\bot\\) is a\ntautology), \\(\\Diamond_i {\\sim}\\bot\\) is true at a state when it is\n\\(i\\)\u2019s turn to move. For a two-player game \\(\\Box_1\\bot\\) &\n\\(\\Box_2\\bot\\) is true of a state that ends the game, because neither\n1 nor 2 can move. \\(\\Box_1\\Diamond_2\\)win\\(_2\\) asserts that player 1\nhas a loss because whatever 1 does from the present state, 2 can win\nin the following move. \n\nFor a more general account of the player\u2019s payoffs, ordering\nrelations \\(\\leq_i\\) can be defined over the states so that \\(s\\leq_i\nt\\) means that \\(i\\)\u2019s payoff for \\(t\\) is at least as good as\nthat for \\(s\\). Another generalization is to express facts about\nsequences \\(q\\) of moves, by introducing operators interpreted by\nrelations \\(sR_q t\\) indicating that the sequence \\(q\\) starting from\ns eventually arrives at \\(t\\). With these and related resources, it is\npossible to express (for example) that \\(q\\) is \\(i\\)\u2019s best\nstrategy given the present state.\n\nIt is crucial to the analysis of games to have a way to express the\ninformation available to the players. One way to accomplish this is to\nborrow ideas from epistemic logic. Here we may introduce an\naccessibility relation \\({\\sim}_i\\) for each player such that\n\\(s{\\sim}_i t\\) holds iff \\(i\\) cannot distinguish between states\n\\(s\\) and \\(t\\). Then knowledge operators \\(\\rK_i\\) for the players\ncan be defined so that \\(\\rK_i A\\) says at \\(s\\) that \\(A\\) holds in\nall worlds that \\(i\\) cannot distinguish from \\(s\\); that is, despite\n\\(i\\)\u2019s ignorance about the state of play, he/she can still be\nconfident that \\(A\\). \\(\\rK\\) operators may be used to say that player\n1 is in a position to resign, for he knows that 2 sees she has a win:\n\\(\\rK_1 \\rK_2\\Box_1\\Diamond_2\\win_2\\).\n\nSince player\u2019s information varies as the game progresses, it is\nuseful to think of moves of the game as indexed by times, and to\nintroduce operators \\(O\\) and \\(U\\) from tense logic for\n\u2018next\u2019 and \u2018until\u2019. Then \\(K_i OA \\rightarrow\nOK_i A\\) expresses that player \\(i\\) has \u201cperfect recall\u201d,\nthat is, that when \\(i\\) knows that \\(A\\) happens next, then at the\nnext moment \\(i\\) has not forgotten that \\(A\\) has happened. This\nillustrates how modal logics for games can reflect cognitive\nidealizations and a player\u2019s success (or failure) at living up\nto them.\n\nThe technical side of the modal logics for games is challenging. The\nproject of identifying systems of rules that are sound and complete\nfor a language containing a large collection of operators may be\nguided by past research, but the interactions between the variety of\naccessibility relations leads to new concerns. Furthermore, the\ncomputational complexity of various systems and their fragments is a\nlarge landscape largely unexplored.\n\nGame theoretic concepts can be applied in a surprising variety of ways\n\u2013 from checking an argument for validity to succeeding in the\npolitical arena. So there are strong motivations for formulating\nlogics that can handle games. What is striking about this research is\nthe power one obtains by weaving together logics of time, agency,\nknowledge, belief, and preference in a unified setting. The lessons\nlearned from that integration have value well beyond what they\ncontribute to understanding games.\n16. Quantifiers in Modal Logic\n\nIt would seem to be a simple matter to outfit a modal logic with the\nquantifiers \\(\\forall\\) (all) and \\(\\exists\\) (some). One would simply\nadd the standard (or classical) rules for quantifiers to the\nprinciples of whichever propositional modal logic one chooses.\nHowever, adding quantifiers to modal logic involves a number of\ndifficulties. Some of these are philosophical. For example, Quine\n(1953) has famously argued that quantifying into modal contexts is\nsimply incoherent, a view that has spawned a gigantic literature.\nQuine\u2019s complaints do not carry the weight they once did. See\nBarcan (1990) for a good summary, and note Kripke\u2019s (2017)\n(written in the 60\u2019s for a class with Quine) which provides a\nstrong formal argument that there can be nothing wrong with\n\u201cquantifying in\u201d.\n\nA second kind of complication is technical. There is a wide variety in\nthe choices one can make in the semantics for quantified modal logic,\nand the proof that a system of rules is correct for a given choice can\nbe difficult. The work of Corsi (2002) and Garson (2005) goes some way\ntowards bringing unity to this terrain, and Johannesson (2018)\nintroduces constraints that help reduce the number of options;\nnevertheless the situation still remains challenging.\n\nAnother complication is that some logicians believe that modality\nrequires abandoning classical quantifier rules in favor of the weaker\nrules of free logic (Garson 2001). The main points of disagreement\nconcerning the quantifier rules can be traced back to decisions about\nhow to handle the domain of quantification. The simplest alternative,\nthe fixed-domain (sometimes called the possibilist) approach, assumes\na single domain of quantification that contains all the possible\nobjects. On the other hand, the world-relative (or actualist)\ninterpretation, assumes that the domain of quantification changes from\nworld to world, and contains only the objects that actually exist in a\ngiven world.\n\nThe fixed-domain approach requires no major adjustments to the\nclassical machinery for the quantifiers. Modal logics that are\nadequate for fixed domain semantics can usually be axiomatized by\nadding principles of a propositional modal logic to classical\nquantifier rules together with the Barcan Formula \\((BF)\\) (Barcan\n1946). (For an account of some interesting exceptions see Cresswell\n(1995).) \n\\[\\tag{\\(BF\\)}\n \\forall x\\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box \\forall  xA.\n\\]\n\n\nThe fixed-domain interpretation has advantages of simplicity and\nfamiliarity, but it does not provide a direct account of the semantics\nof certain quantifier expressions of natural language. We do not think\nthat \u2018Some man exists who signed the Declaration of\nIndependence\u2019 is true, at least not if we read\n\u2018exists\u2019 in the present tense. Nevertheless, this sentence\nwas true in 1777, which shows that the domain for the natural language\nexpression \u2018some man exists who\u2019 changes to reflect which\nmen exist at different times. A related problem is that on the\nfixed-domain interpretation, the sentence \\(\\forall y\\Box \\exists\nx(x=y)\\) is valid. Assuming that \\(\\exists x(x=y)\\) is read: \\(y\\)\nexists, \\(\\forall y\\Box \\exists x(x=y)\\) says that everything exists\nnecessarily. However, it seems a fundamental feature of common ideas\nabout modality that the existence of many things is contingent and\nthat different objects exist in different possible worlds. \n\nThe defender of the fixed-domain interpretation may respond to these\nobjections by insisting that on his (her) reading of the quantifiers,\nthe domain of quantification contains all possible objects,\nnot just the objects that happen to exist at a given world. So the\ntheorem \\(\\forall y\\Box \\exists x(x=y)\\) makes the innocuous claim\nthat every possible object is necessarily found in the domain\nof all possible objects. Furthermore, those quantifier expressions of\nnatural language whose domain is world (or time) dependent can be\nexpressed using the fixed-domain quantifier \\(\\exists x\\) and a\npredicate letter \\(E\\) with the reading \u2018actually exists\u2019.\nFor example, instead of translating \u2018Some \\(M\\)an exists who\n\\(S\\)igned the Declaration of Independence\u2019 by \n\\[\n \\exists x(Mx \\amp Sx),\n\\]\n\n\nthe defender of fixed domains may write:  \n\\[\n \\exists x(Ex \\amp Mx \\amp Sx),\n\\]\n\n\nthus ensuring the translation is counted false at the present time.\nCresswell (1991) makes the interesting observation that world-relative\nquantification has limited expressive power relative to fixed-domain\nquantification. World-relative quantification can be defined with\nfixed-domain quantifiers and \\(E\\), but there is no way to fully\nexpress fixed-domain quantifiers with world-relative ones. Although\nthis argues in favor of the classical approach to quantified modal\nlogic, the translation tactic also amounts to something of a\nconcession in favor of free logic, for the world-relative quantifiers\nso defined obey exactly the free logic rules. \n\nA problem with the translation strategy used by defenders of\nfixed-domain quantification is that rendering the English into logic\nis less direct, since \\(E\\) must be added to all translations of all\nsentences whose quantifier expressions have domains that are context\ndependent. A more serious objection to fixed-domain quantification is\nthat it strips the quantifier of a role which Quine recommended for\nit, namely to record robust ontological commitment. On this view, the\ndomain of \\(\\exists x\\) must contain only entities that are\nontologically respectable, and possible objects are too abstract to\nqualify. Actualists of this stripe will want to develop the logic of a\nquantifier \\(\\exists x\\) which reflects commitment to what is actual\nin a given world rather than to what is merely possible.\n\nHowever, some work on actualism tends to undermine this objection. For\nexample, Linsky and Zalta (1994) and Williamson (2013) argue that the\nfixed-domain quantifier can be given an interpretation that is\nperfectly acceptable to actualists. Pavone (2018) even contends that\non the haecceitist interpretation, which quantifies over individual\nessences, fixed domains are required. Actualists who employ possible\nworlds semantics routinely quantify over possible worlds in their\nsemantical theory of language. So it would seem that possible worlds\nare actual by these actualist\u2019s lights. By populating the domain\nwith abstract entities no more objectionable than possible worlds,\nactualists may vindicate the Barcan Formula and classical\nprinciples. \n\nHowever, recent work suggests that the fixed domain option may not be\nas actualist as originally thought; see Menzel 2020 and the entry on\nthe possibilism-actualism\ndebate. And some actualists might respond that they need not be\ncommitted to the actuality of possible worlds so long as it is\nunderstood that quantifiers used in their theory of language lack\nstrong ontological import. Furthermore, Hayaki (2006) argues that\nquantifying over abstract entities is actually incompatible with any\nserious form of actualism. In any case, it is open to actualists (and\nnon-actualists as well) to investigate the logic of quantifiers with\nmore robust domains, for example domains excluding possible worlds and\nother such abstract entities, and containing only the spatio-temporal\nparticulars found in a given world. For quantifiers of this kind,\nworld-relative domains are appropriate.\n\nSuch considerations motivate interest in systems that acknowledge the\ncontext dependence of quantification by introducing world-relative\ndomains. Here each possible world has its own domain of quantification\n(the set of objects that actually exist in that world), and the\ndomains vary from one world to the next. When this decision is made, a\ndifficulty arises for classical quantification theory. Notice that the\nsentence \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) is a theorem of classical logic, and so\n\\(\\Box \\exists x(x=t)\\) is a theorem of \\(\\bK\\) by the Necessitation\nRule. Let the term \\(t\\) stand for Saul Kripke. Then this theorem says\nthat it is necessary that Saul Kripke exists, so that he is in the\ndomain of every possible world. The whole motivation for the\nworld-relative approach was to reflect the idea that objects in one\nworld may fail to exist in another. If standard quantifier rulers are\nused, however, every term \\(t\\) must refer to something that exists in\nall the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary\npractice of using terms to refer to things that only exist\ncontingently.\n\nOne response to this difficulty is simply to eliminate terms. Kripke\n(1963) gives an example of a system that uses the world-relative\ninterpretation and preserves the classical rules. However, the costs\nare severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and\nsecond, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be\nweakened.\n\nPresuming that we would like a language that includes terms, and that\nclassical rules are to be added to standard systems of propositional\nmodal logic, a new problem arises. In such a system, it is possible to\nprove \\((CBF)\\), the converse of the Barcan Formula. \n\\[\\tag{\\(CBF\\)}\n \\Box \\forall xA\\rightarrow \\forall x\\Box A.\n\\]\n\n\nThis fact has serious consequences for the system\u2019s semantics.\nIt is not difficult to show that every world-relative model of\n\\((CBF)\\) must meet condition \\((ND)\\) (for \u2018nested\ndomains\u2019). \n\n\\((ND)\\)   If \\(wRv\\)\nthen the domain of \\(w\\) is a subset of the domain of \\(v\\).\n\n\n\nHowever \\((ND)\\) conflicts with the point of introducing\nworld-relative domains. The whole idea was that existence of objects\nis contingent so that there are accessible possible worlds where one\nof the things in our world fails to exist. \n\nA straightforward solution to these problems is to abandon classical\nrules for the quantifiers and to adopt rules for free logic\n\\((\\mathbf{FL})\\) instead. The rules of \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\) are the same\nas the classical rules, except that inferences from \\(\\forall xRx\\)\n(everything is real) to \\(Rp\\) (Pegasus is real) are blocked. This is\ndone by introducing a predicate \u2018\\(E\\)\u2019 (for\n\u2018actually exists\u2019) and modifying the rule of universal\ninstantiation. From \\(\\forall xRx\\) one is allowed to obtain \\(Rp\\)\nonly if one also has obtained \\(Ep\\). Assuming that the universal\nquantifier \\(\\forall x\\) is primitive, and the existential quantifier\n\\(\\exists x\\) is defined by \\(\\exists xA =_{df} {\\sim}\\forall\nx{\\sim}A\\), then \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\) may be constructed by adding the\nfollowing two principles to the rules of propositional logic.\n\nFree Universal Generalization.\n\nIf \\(B\\rightarrow(Ey\\rightarrow A(y))\\) is a theorem, so is\n\\(B\\rightarrow \\forall xA(x)\\).\n\nFree Universal Instantiation.\n\n\\(\\forall xA(x)\\rightarrow(Et\\rightarrow A(t))\\) \n\n(Here it is assumed that \\(A(x)\\) is any well-formed formula of\npredicate logic and that \\(A(y)\\) and \\(A(t)\\) result from replacing\n\\(y\\) and \\(t\\) properly for each occurrence of \\(x\\) in \\(A(x)\\).)\nNote that the instantiation axiom is restricted by mention of \\(Et\\)\nin the antecedent. The rule of Free Universial Generalization is\nmodified in the same way. In \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\), proofs of formulas like\n\\(\\exists x\\Box(x=t)\\), \\(\\forall y\\Box \\exists x(x=y)\\), \\((CBF)\\),\nand \\((BF)\\), which seem incompatible with the world-relative\ninterpretation, are blocked. \n\nOne philosophical objection to \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\) is that \\(E\\) appears\nto be an existence predicate, and many would argue that existence is\nnot a legitimate property like being green or weighing more than four\npounds. So philosophers who reject the idea that existence is a\npredicate may object to \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\). However in most (but not all)\nquantified modal logics that include identity \\((=)\\) these worries\nmay be skirted by defining \\(E\\) as follows. \n\\[\n Et =_{df} \\exists x(x=t).\n\\]\n\n\nThe most general way to formulate quantified modal logic is to create\n\\(\\mathbf{FS}\\) by adding the rules of \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\) to a given\npropositional modal logic \\(\\mathbf{S}\\). In situations where\nclassical quantification is desired, one may simply add \\(Et\\) as an\naxiom to \\(\\mathbf{FS}\\), so that the classical principles become\nderivable rules. Adequacy results for such systems can be obtained for\nmost choices of the modal logic \\(\\mathbf{S}\\), but there are\nexceptions (Cresswell (1995). \n\nThere is another way to formulate quantified modal logics for\nworld-relative domains that avoids the non-standard quantifier rules\nof free logic and allows term constants in the language. Deutsch\n(1990) shows how to define such a semantics, where the classical\nprinciple \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) comes out valid. His strategy is inspired\nby Kaplan\u2019s (1989) idea that validity and necessity may part\ncompany. (See the discussion of two-dimensional semantics in\n Section 10\n above.) Kaplan showed that there are sentences such as \u2018I am\nhere now\u2019 that qualify as logically valid, because they are true\nin any context of their assertion, but which are not necessary. That\nsuggests a reply to anyone who objects to the classical theorem\n\\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) on the grounds that \u2018\\(t\\) exists\u2019 is\nnot necessary. One need only point out that the validity of \\(\\exists\nx(x=t)\\) is in fact compatible with its contingency.\n\nSpecial adjustments to the formal semantics are needed to flesh out\nthis idea. Deutsch introduces what he calls \u2018contexts of\norigin\u2019 as sequences of possible worlds. (These are not to be\nconfused with Kaplan\u2019s linguistic contexts.) However, Stephanou\n(2002) shows how to streamline the definition of a model so that this\nextra machinery is avoided. Deutsch\u2019s main idea is that a model\ndistinguishes one of the possible worlds \\(w^*\\) as actual, and the\nterm constants are directly assigned referents in the domain for\n\\(w^*\\). That ensures that \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) is true in \\(w^*\\).\nAlthough \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) is false in other worlds where the\nreferent of \\(t\\) does not exist, the definition of validity for this\nsemantics rates a sentence true provided it is true at the actual\nworld \\(w^*\\) for each model. The result is that \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\)\nand all classical quantifier principles are rated valid, even though\n\\(\\Box\\exists x(x=t)\\) is not.\n\nStephanou (2002) provides a set of axioms and rules that exactly\ncapture this notion of validity. Classical laws of quantification are\npreserved in the sense that the provable formulas lacking any modal\noperator are the classical ones. However, restrictions must be placed\non the rules of propositional modal logic. The Necessitation Rule (If\n\\(A\\) is a theorem, then so is \\(\\Box A\\)) cannot be accepted because\n\\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) is valid, while \\(\\Box\\exists x(x=t)\\) is not.\nFurthermore, the rules for quantification are more complex. Two axioms\nof Universal Instantiation are needed. One is restricted: \\(\\forall\nxA(x)\\rightarrow(Ft\\rightarrow A(t))\\), where \\(Ft\\) is any atomic\nsentence containing term \\(t\\). Since the semantics requires all\npredicate letters to have extensions for a world in the domain of that\nworld, \\(Ft\\) ensures that \\(t\\) refers to something that exists. So\nthis restricted axiom reminds one of Free Universal Instantiation. The\nsecond axiom is an unrestricted form of Instantiation: \\(\\forall\nxA(x)\\rightarrow A(t)\\). However, this principle comes with the\nproviso that once it is used in a proof, no axioms or rules may be\nused other than it and Modus Ponens. This has the effect of blocking\nthe use of Necessitation to obtain \\(\\Box\\exists x(x=t)\\) from\n\\(\\exists x(x=t)\\).\n\nNote that this strategy cannot treat all proper names in English as\nterms of the formal language, since those terms refer to what exists\nin the actual world. Therefore names for fictional entities\n(\u2018Pegasus\u2019) must be dealt with in another way, perhaps\nwith Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions. An alternative treatment\nwould also be need in a temporal logic for names of those who are\ndeceased (\u2018Benjamin Franklin\u2019).\n\nA final complication in the semantics for quantified modal logic is\nworth mentioning. It arises when non-rigid expressions such as\n\u2018the inventor of bifocals\u2019 are introduced to the language.\nA term is non-rigid when it picks out different objects in different\npossible worlds. The semantical value of such a term can be given by\nwhat Carnap (1947) called an individual concept, a function that picks\nout the denotation of the term for each possible world. One approach\nto dealing with non-rigid terms is to employ Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions. However, in a language that treats non rigid expressions\nas genuine terms, it turns out that neither the classical nor the free\nlogic rules for the quantifiers are acceptable. (The problem cannot be\nresolved by weakening the rule of substitution for identity.) A\nsolution to this problem is to employ a more general treatment of the\nquantifiers, where the domain of quantification contains individual\nconcepts rather than objects. This more general interpretation\nprovides a better match between the treatment of terms and the\ntreatment of quantifiers and results in systems that are adequate for\nclassical or free logic rules (depending on whether the fixed domains\nor world-relative domains are chosen). It also provides a language\nwith strong and much needed expressive powers (Bressan, 1973, Belnap\nand M\u00fcller, 2013a, 2013b). (See also Aloni (2005) who explores\nthe pros and cons of quantifying over individual concepts in\nepistemic logic.) \n",
