    "main_text": "Indefinite, Definite, and Bare Singular Generics || Indefinite Singular Generics and Normativity\n3.1 Indefinite Singular Generics and Normativity\n\nUnlike bare plurals, singular generics can easily be infelicitous. For\nexample, it is perfectly fine to say\n (36)\n or\n (37):\n\n(36)\nA madrigal is polyphonic\n(37)\nA football hero is popular\n\n\nBut not\n (38):\n\n(38)\n*A madrigal is popular\n\n\n(Notice, however, that the plural version of\n (38)\n \u201cmadrigals are popular\u201d is perfectly felicitous (though\nperhaps false, unfortunately).)\n\nLawler (1973) notes that indefinite singulars are only felicitous when\nthey express properties that are somehow \u201cnecessary\u201d,\n\u201cessential\u201d or \u201cinherent\u201d to the kind.\nBurton-Roberts (1977) argues that indefinite singulars carry a special\nnormative force, while Krifka et al. (1995) take a different tact,\narguing that the facts can be accounted for in terms of logical\nform.\n\nMore generally, linguists such as Carlson (1995), Cohen (2001), and\nGreenberg (2003) have noted that generics can sometimes have a\nnormative flavor, e.g. \u201ca gentleman opens the door for\nladies\u201d or \u201cboys don\u2019t cry.\u201d A connection\nbetween linguistic form (e.g., bare plural vs. indefinitely singular)\nand normativity is often drawn, with some theorists such as Greenberg\n(2003) and Cohen (2001) arguing that indefinite singulars can express\nonly \u201crules and regulations\u201d, in the sense of Carlson\n(1995).\n\nGreenberg and Cohen offer distinct semantic analyses of the phenomenon\nof normative generics: Greenberg (2003) implements her analysis by way\nof possible worlds semantics, while Cohen proposes that the logical\nform of such normative generics are entirely different from that of\ndescriptive generics. In particular, for Cohen (2001), normative\ngenerics assert that certain rules are in effect, as opposed to\nexpressing generalizations over kinds.\n\nLeslie (2015b) offers an alternative account of how some generics can\nhave normative force, building on the work of Knobe, Prasada, and\nNewman (2013) on dual character concepts. Knobe et al. note that\ncertain concepts seem to have dual normative/descriptive senses. For\nexample, we might say of a professional scientist who cares only about\ngetting grants and publications and not at all about discovering the\ntruth that though there is a sense in which they are clearly a\nscientist, there is also a sense in which they are not a (true)\nscientist. Conversely, we might say of a postal worker who\napplies the scientific method whenever they can and who cares about\ntruth above all else that even though there is a sense in which\nthey are clearly not a scientist, there is nonetheless a sense in\nwhich they are a (true) scientist. Leslie proposes that a given\ngeneric has normative reading just in case the kind in question is\nassociated with a dual character concept.\n\nUnlike Greenberg, Cohen, and Leslie, Hesni (2021) argues that the\nnormative force of generic statements cannot be located in the\nsemantics of generic statements. Instead, Hesni proposes that when we\nconsider a wider variety of generic sentences that do not contain dual\ncharacter concepts but appear to have normative force in certain\ncontexts (e.g., \u201cRocks aren\u2019t breakfast\u201d), we must\nappeal to Gricean pragmatics to explain their normative force.\n",
