He distinguished two forms of probability:\nProbability\\(_1\\) or \u201cdegree of confirmation\u201d \\(P_1 (h ;\ne)\\) is a logical relation between two sentences, a\nhypothesis h and a sentence e reporting a series of\nobservations. Statements of this type are either analytical or\ncontradictory. The second form, Probability\\(_2\\) or \u201crelative\nfrequency\u201d, is the statistical concept. In the words of his\nstudent Solomonoff (1997):\n\n\nCarnap\u2019s model of probability started with a long sequence of\nsymbols that was a description of the entire universe. Through his own\nformal linguistic analysis, he was able to assign a priori\nprobabilities to any possible string of symbols that might represent\nthe universe.\n\n\nThe method for assigning probabilities Carnap used, was not universal\nand depended heavily on the code systems used. A general theory of\ninduction using Bayes\u2019 rule can only be developed when we can\nassign a universal probability to \u201cany possible string\u201d of\nsymbols. In a paper in 1960 Solomonoff (1960, 1964a,b) was the first\nto sketch an outline of a solution for this problem. He formulated the\nnotion of what is now called a universal probability\ndistribution: consider the set of all possible finite strings to\nbe programs for a universal Turing machine U and define the\nprobability of a string x of symbols in terms of the length of\nthe shortest program p that outputs x on U.\n\nThis notion of Algorithmic Information Theory was invented\nindependently somewhat later separately by Kolmogorov (1965) and\nChaitin (1969). Levin (1974) developed a mathematical expression of\nthe universal a priori probability as a universal (that is,\nmaximal) lower semicomputable semimeasure M, and showed that\nthe negative logarithm of \\(M(x)\\) coincides with the Kolmogorov\ncomplexity of x up to an additive logarithmic term. The actual\ndefinition of the complexity measure is: \n\n\nKolmogorov complexity The algorithmic complexity of a\nstring x is the length \\(\\cal{l}(p)\\) of the smallest program\np that produces x when it runs on a universal Turing\nmachine U, noted as \\(U(p)=x\\):  \n\\[K(x):=\\min_p \\{l(p), U(p)=x\\}\\]\n\n\n\nAlgorithmic Information Theory (a.k.a. Kolmogorov complexity theory)\nhas developed into a rich field of research with a wide range of\ndomains of applications many of which are philosophically relevant (Li\n& Vit\u00e1nyi 2019):\n\nIt provides us with a general theory of induction. The use of\nBayes\u2019 rule allows for a modern reformulation of Ockham\u2019s\nrazor in terms of Minimum Description Length (Rissanen 1978, 1989;\nBarron, Rissanen, & Yu 1998; Gr\u00fcnwald 2007, Long 2019) and\nminimum message length (Wallace 2005). Note that Domingos (1998) has\nargued against the general validity of these principles.\nIt allows us to formulate probabilities and information content\nfor individual objects. Even individual natural numbers.\nIt lays the foundation for a theory of learning as data\ncompression (Adriaans 2007).\nIt gives a definition of randomness of a string in terms of\nincompressibility. This in itself has led to a whole new domain of\nresearch (Niess 2009; Downey & Hirschfeld 2010).\nIt allows us to formulate an objective a priori measure\nof the predictive value of a theory in terms of its randomness\ndeficiency: i.e., the best theory is the shortest theory that makes\nthe data look random conditional to the theory. (Vereshchagin &\nVit\u00e1nyi 2004).\n\n\nThere are also down-sides:\n\nAlgorithmic complexity is uncomputable, although it can in a lot\nof practical cases be approximated and commercial compression programs\nin some cases come close to the theoretical optimum (Cilibrasi &\nVit\u00e1nyi 2005).\nAlgorithmic complexity is an asymptotic measure (i.e., it gives a\nvalue that is correct up to a constant). In some cases the value of\nthis constant is prohibitive for use in practical purposes.\nAlthough the shortest theory is always the best one in terms of\nrandomness deficiency, incremental compression of data-sets is in\ngeneral not a good learning strategy since the randomness deficiency\ndoes not decrease monotonically with the compression rate (Adriaans\n& Vit\u00e1nyi 2009).\nThe generality of the definitions provided by Algorithmic\nInformation Theory depends on the generality of the concept of a\nuniversal Turing machine and thus ultimately on the interpretation of\nthe Church-Turing-Thesis.\nThe Kolmogorov complexity of an object does not take in to account\nthe amount of time it takes to actually compute the object. In this\ncontext Levin proposed a variant of Kolmogorov complexity that\npenalizes the computation time (Levin 1973, 1984):\n\n\n\nLevin complexity The Levin complexity of a string\nx is the sum of the length \\(\\cal{l}(p)\\) and the logarithm of\nthe computation time of the smallest program p that produces\nx when it runs on a universal Turing machine U, noted as\n\\(U(p)=x\\):  \n\\[Kt(x):=\\min_p \\{l(p) + \\log(time(p)), U(p)=x\\}\\]\n\n \n\n\nAlgorithmic Information Theory has gained rapid acceptance as a\nfundamental theory of information. The well-known introduction in\nInformation Theory by Cover and Thomas (2006) states:\n\u201c\u2026 we consider Kolmogorov complexity (i.e., AIT) to be\nmore fundamental than Shannon entropy\u201d (2006: 3).\n\nThe idea that algorithmic complexity theory is a foundation for a\ngeneral theory of artificial intelligence (and theory of knowledge)\nhas already been suggested by Solomonoff (1997) and Chaitin (1987).\nSeveral authors have defended that data compression is a general\nprinciple that governs human cognition (Chater & Vit\u00e1nyi\n2003; Wolff 2006). Hutter (2005, 2007a,b) argues that\nSolomonoff\u2019s formal and complete theory essentially solves the\ninduction problem. Hutter (2007a) and Rathmanner & Hutter (2011)\nenumerate a plethora of classical philosophical and statistical\nproblems around induction and claim that Solomonoff\u2019s theory\nsolves or avoids all these problems. Probably because of its technical\nnature, the theory has been largely ignored by the philosophical\ncommunity. Yet, it stands out as one of the most fundamental\ncontributions to information theory in the twentieth century and it is\nclearly relevant for a number of philosophical issues, such as the\nproblem of induction.\n",
