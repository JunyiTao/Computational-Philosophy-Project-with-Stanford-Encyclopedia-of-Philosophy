    "main_text": "The Role of Substance in the Study of Being Qua Being\n3. The Role of Substance in the Study of Being Qua Being\n\nThe Categories leads us to expect that the study of being in\ngeneral (being qua being) will crucially involve the study of\nsubstance, and when we turn to the Metaphysics we are not\ndisappointed. First, in Metaphysics \u0393 Aristotle argues\nin a new way for the ontological priority of substance; and then, in\nBooks \u0396, \u0397, and \u0398, he wrestles with the problem of what\nit is to be a substance. We will begin with \u0393\u2019s account of\nthe central place of substance in the study of being qua being.\n\nAs we noted above, metaphysics (or, first philosophy) is the science\nwhich studies being qua being. In this respect it is unlike the\nspecialized or departmental sciences, which study only part of being\n(only some of the things that exist) or study beings only in a\nspecialized way (e.g., only in so far as they are changeable, rather\nthan in so far as they are beings).\n\nBut \u2018being\u2019, as Aristotle tells us in \u0393.2, is\n\u201csaid in many ways\u201d. That is, the verb \u2018to be\u2019\n(einai) has different senses, as do its cognates\n\u2018being\u2019 (on) and \u2018entities\u2019\n(onta). So the universal science of being qua being appears\nto founder on an equivocation: how can there be a single science of\nbeing when the very term \u2018being\u2019 is ambiguous?\n\nConsider an analogy. There are dining tables, and there are tide\ntables. A dining table is a table in the sense of a smooth flat slab\nfixed on legs; a tide table is a table in the sense of a systematic\narrangement of data in rows and columns. But there is not a single\nsense of \u2018table\u2019 which applies to both the piece of\nfurniture at which I am writing these words and to the small booklet\nthat lies upon it. Hence it would be foolish to expect that there is a\nsingle science of tables, in general, that would include among its\nobjects both dining tables and tide tables. Tables, that is to say, do\nnot constitute a single kind with a single definition, so no single\nscience, or field of knowledge, can encompass precisely those things\nthat are correctly called \u2018tables\u2019.\n\nIf the term \u2018being\u2019 were ambiguous in the way that\n\u2018table\u2019 is, Aristotle\u2019s science of being qua being\nwould be as impossible as a science of tables qua tables. But,\nAristotle argues in \u0393.2, \u2018being\u2019 is not ambiguous in\nthis way. \u2018Being\u2019, he tells us, is \u2018said in many\nways\u2019 but it is not merely (what he calls)\n\u2018homonymous\u2019, i.e., sheerly ambiguous. Rather, the various\nsenses of \u2018being\u2019 have what he calls a \u2018pros\nhen\u2019 ambiguity\u2014they are all related to a single\ncentral sense. (The Greek phrase \u2018pros hen\u2019 means\n\u201cin relation to one.\u201d)\n\nAristotle explains his point by means of some examples that he takes\nto be analogous to \u2018being\u2019. Consider the terms\n\u2018healthy\u2019 and \u2018medical\u2019. Neither of these has\na single definition that applies uniformly to all cases: not every\nhealthy (or medical) thing is healthy (medical) in the same sense of\n\u2018healthy\u2019 (\u2018medical\u2019). There is a range of\nthings that can be called \u2018healthy\u2019: people, diets,\nexercise, complexions, etc. Not all of these are healthy in the same\nsense. Exercise is healthy in the sense of being productive of health;\na clear complexion is healthy in the sense of being symptomatic of\nhealth; a person is healthy in the sense of having good health.\n\nBut notice that these various senses have something in common: a\nreference to one central thing, health, which is actually possessed by\nonly some of the things that are spoken of as \u2018healthy\u2019,\nnamely, healthy organisms, and these are said to be healthy in the\nprimary sense of the term. Other things are considered healthy only in\nso far as they are appropriately related to things that are healthy in\nthis primary sense.\n\nThe situation is the same, Aristotle claims, with the term\n\u2018being\u2019. It, too, has a primary sense as well as related\nsenses in which it applies to other things because they are\nappropriately related to things that are called \u2018beings\u2019\nin the primary sense. The beings in the primary sense are substances;\nthe beings in other senses are the qualities, quantities, etc., that\nbelong to substances. An animal, e.g., a horse, is a being, and so is\na color, e.g, white, a being. But a horse is a being in the primary\nsense\u2014it is a substance\u2014whereas the color white (a\nquality) is a being only because it qualifies some substance. An\naccount of the being of anything that is, therefore, will ultimately\nhave to make some reference to substance. Hence, the science of being\nqua being will involve an account of the central case of\nbeings\u2014substances.\n",
