    "main_text": "Some general considerations || Logicians\n1.1 Logicians\n\nLogicians are often interested in displaying the underlying logical\nstructure of a theory, physical or mathematical, and in exploring\nwhether or not there are alternatives, usually by changing the\nunderlying logical principles. One could imagine a geometry based not\non classical logic, but, e.g., on intuitionistic logic, where\nprinciples such as the excluded third, i.e., \\(p\\) or not-\\(p\\), for\nany statement \\(p\\), or double negation, i.e., if not-not-\\(p\\) then\n\\(p\\), no longer hold. Often the goal is to find a complete\nclassification of all possibilities. This approach implies that the\nlogician working on and developing discrete models, does not\nnecessarily believe that these models are correct or true in some\nsense. They merely help to understand better what classical geometry\nis.\n\nA perfect illustration of such an approach is the work on spatial\nlogic, see Aiello et al. (2007) for an excellent overview. The authors\ncompare their approach to the work done in temporal logic (see the\nentry on\n temporal logic\n in this encyclopedia). There are plenty of ways to model time: with a\nstarting and/or final point, discrete or continuous, linear, cyclic or\nbranching, \u2026. The logical task is to construct a language that\nallows one to \u201ctalk\u201d about all these structures and to be\nable to differentiate between them. In temporal logic such a language\nuses the operators \\(Fp\\) (\u201cI will be the case that\n\\(p\\)\u201d) and \\(Pp\\) (\u201cIt has been the case that\n\\(p\\)\u201d). One example: if time is linear in the future, then this\nproperty can be expressed as follows. Suppose that \\(Fp\\) and \\(Fq\\)\nare given, then only three things are possible: either \\(F(p \\amp\nq)\\), i.e., \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) will be the case, or \\(F(p \\amp Fq)\\),\ni.e., \\(p\\) will happen first and then \\(q\\), or \\(F(Fp \\amp q)\\),\ni.e., the other way round. In one formula: \\((Fp \\amp Fq) \\rightarrow\n(F(p \\amp q)\\) or \\(F(p \\amp Fq)\\) or \\(F(Fp \\amp q))\\). In an\nentirely similar way, to construct such a language is what spatial\nlogic wants to achieve for geometry and is thus related to the\nproposals that we will discuss in\n section 3.\n\nA different logical approach is to make the connection between\nconstructivity in geometry and constructivity in logic. Naibo (2015)\nis a fine example, leading to a rather particular view on geometry as\nthe author claims that \u201cEuclidean geometry can be seen as a\ntheory the ontology of which is not composed of a set of extensional\nobjects playing the role of references of language expressions but is\ncomposed instead of intensional objects represented by constructive\nactions corresponding to the algorithmic procedures\u201d (Naibo\n2015, 158). Such approaches are related to the constructive, more\nconcrete and non-intensional approach of Suppes, discussed in\n section 2.3.\n",
