    "main_text": "The Field and its Significance\n1. The Field and its Significance\n\nIdeally, a guide to the nature and history of philosophy of religion\nwould begin with an analysis or definition of religion. Unfortunately,\nthere is no current consensus on a precise identification of the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions of what counts as a religion. We\ntherefore currently lack a decisive criterion that would enable clear\nrulings whether some movements should count as religions (e.g.,\nScientology or Cargo cults of the Pacific islands). But while\nconsensus in precise details is elusive, the following general\ndepiction of what counts as a religion may be helpful:\n\n\nA religion involves a communal, transmittable body of teachings and\nprescribed practices about an ultimate, sacred reality or state of\nbeing that calls for reverence or awe, a body which guides its\npractitioners into what it describes as a saving, illuminating or\nemancipatory relationship to this reality through a personally\ntransformative life of prayer, ritualized meditation, and/or moral\npractices like repentance and personal regeneration. [This is a\nslightly modified definition of the one for \u201cReligion\u201d in\nthe Dictionary of Philosophy of Religion, Taliaferro &\nMarty 2010: 196\u2013197; 2018, 240.]\n\n\nThis definition does not involve some obvious shortcomings such as\nonly counting a tradition as religious if it involves belief in God or\ngods, as some recognized religions such as Buddhism (in its main\nforms) does not involve a belief in God or gods. Although\ncontroversial, the definition provides some reason for thinking\nScientology and the Cargo cults are proto-religious insofar as these\nmovements do not have a robust communal, transmittable body of\nteachings and meet the other conditions for being a religion. (So,\nwhile both examples are not decisively ruled out as religions, it is\nperhaps understandable that in Germany, Scientology is labeled a\n\u201csect\u201d, whereas in France it is classified as \u201ca\ncult\u201d.) For a discussion of other definitions of religion, see\nTaliaferro 2009, chapter one, and for a recent, different analysis,\nsee Graham Oppy 2018, chapter three. The topic of defining religion is\nre-engaged below in the\n section 4, \u201cReligion and Science\u201d.\n But rather than devoting more space to definitions at the outset, a\npragmatic policy will be adopted: for the purpose of this entry, it\nwill be assumed that those traditions that are widely recognized today\nas religions are, indeed, religions. It will be assumed, then, that\nreligions include (at least) Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism,\nJudaism, Christianity, Islam, and those traditions that are like them.\nThis way of delimiting a domain is sometimes described as employing a\ndefinition by examples (an ostensive definition) or making an appeal\nto a family resemblance between things. It will also be assumed that\nGreco-Roman views of gods, rituals, the afterlife, the soul, are\nbroadly \u201creligious\u201d or \u201creligiously\nsignificant\u201d. Given the pragmatic, open-ended use of the term\n\u201creligion\u201d the hope is to avoid beginning our inquiry with\na procrustean bed.\n\nGiven the above, broad perspective of what counts as religion, the\nroots of what we call philosophy of religion stretch back to\nthe earliest forms of philosophy. From the outset, philosophers in\nAsia, the Near and Middle East, North Africa, and Europe reflected on\nthe gods or God, duties to the divine, the origin and nature of the\ncosmos, an afterlife, the nature of happiness and obligations, whether\nthere are sacred duties to family or rulers, and so on. As with each\nof what would come to be considered sub-fields of philosophy today\n(like philosophy of science, philosophy of art), philosophers in the\nAncient world addressed religiously significant themes (just as they\ntook up reflections on what we call science and art) in the course of\ntheir overall practice of philosophy. While from time to time in the\nMedieval era, some Jewish, Christian, and Islamic philosophers sought\nto demarcate philosophy from theology or religion, the evident role of\nphilosophy of religion as a distinct field of philosophy does not seem\napparent until the mid-twentieth century. A case can be made, however,\nthat there is some hint of the emergence of philosophy of religion in\nthe seventeenth century philosophical movement Cambridge Platonism.\nRalph Cudworth (1617\u20131688), Henry More (1614\u20131687), and\nother members of this movement were the first philosophers to practice\nphilosophy in English; they introduced in English many of the terms\nthat are frequently employed in philosophy of religion today,\nincluding the term \u201cphilosophy of religion\u201d, as well as\n\u201ctheism\u201d, \u201cconsciousness\u201d,and\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d. The Cambridge Platonists provided the first\nEnglish versions of the cosmological, ontological, and teleological\narguments, reflections on the relationship of faith and reason, and\nthe case for tolerating different religions. While the Cambridge\nPlatonists might have been the first explicit philosophers of\nreligion, for the most part, their contemporaries and successors\naddressed religion as part of their overall work. There is reason,\ntherefore, to believe that philosophy of religion only gradually\nemerged as a distinct sub-field of philosophy in the mid-twentieth\ncentury. (For an earlier date, see James Collins\u2019 stress on\nHume, Kant and Hegel in The Emergence of Philosophy of\nReligion, 1967.)\n\nToday, philosophy of religion is one of the most vibrant areas of\nphilosophy. Articles in philosophy of religion appear in virtually all\nthe main philosophical journals, while some journals (such as the\nInternational Journal for Philosophy of Religion,\nReligious Studies, Sophia, Faith and\nPhilosophy, the European Journal for Philosophy of\nReligion, Open Theology, Analytical Theology\nand others) are dedicated especially to philosophy of religion.\nPhilosophy of religion is in evidence at institutional meetings of\nphilosophers (such as the meetings of the American Philosophical\nAssociation and of the Royal Society of Philosophy). There are\nsocieties dedicated to the field such as the Society for Philosophy of\nReligion (USA) and the British Society for Philosophy of Religion and\nthe field is supported by multiple centers such as the Center for\nPhilosophy of Religion at the University of Notre Dame, the Rutgers\nCenter for Philosophy of Religion, the Centre for the Philosophy of\nReligion at Glasgow University, The John Hick Centre for Philosophy of\nReligion at the University of Birmingham, and other sites (such as the\nUniversity of Roehampton and Nottingham University). Oxford University\nPress published in 2009 The History of Western Philosophy of\nReligion in five volumes involving over 100 contributors (Oppy\n& Trakakis 2009), and in 2021 Wiley Blackwell published the\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy of Religion in four volumes, with\nover 250 contributors from around the world. What accounts for this\nvibrancy? Consider four possible reasons.\n\nFirst: The religious nature of the world population. Most social\nresearch on religion supports the view that the majority of the\nworld\u2019s population is either part of a religion or influenced by\nreligion (see the Pew Research Center online). To engage in philosophy\nof religion is therefore to engage in a subject that affects actual\npeople, rather than only tangentially touching on matters of present\nsocial concern. Perhaps one of the reasons why philosophy of religion\nis often the first topic in textbook introductions to philosophy is\nthat this is one way to propose to readers that philosophical study\ncan impact what large numbers of people actually think about life and\nvalue. The role of philosophy of religion in engaging real life\nbeliefs (and doubts) about religion is perhaps also evidenced by the\ncurrent popularity of books for and against theism in the UK and USA.\nInterest in the question \u201cis religion dangerous?\u201d (the\ntitle of a 2006 book by Keith Ward) calls for work in history,\nsociology, and psychology, as well was philosophy of religion.\n\nOne other aspect of religious populations that may motivate philosophy\nof religion is that philosophy is a tool that may be used when persons\ncompare different religious traditions. Philosophy of religion can\nplay an important role in helping persons understand and evaluate\ndifferent religious traditions and their alternatives. See, for\nexample, the philosophically oriented survey Religions: a Quick\nImmersion and Victoria Harrison\u2019s Eastern Philosophy of\nReligion. \n\nSecond: Philosophy of religion as a field may be popular because of\nthe overlapping interests found in both religious and philosophical\ntraditions. Both religious and philosophical thinking raise many of\nthe same, fascinating questions and possibilities about the nature of\nreality, the limits of reason, the meaning of life, and so on. Are\nthere good reasons for believing in God? What is good and evil? What\nis the nature and scope of human knowledge? In Hinduism; A\nContemporary Philosophical Investigation (2018), Shyam\nRanganathan argues that in Asian thought philosophy and religion are\nalmost inseparable such that interest in the one supports an interest\nin the other.\n\nThird, studying the history of philosophy provides ample reasons to\nhave some expertise in philosophy of religion. In the West, the\nmajority of ancient, medieval, and modern philosophers philosophically\nreflected on matters of religious significance. Among these modern\nphilosophers, it would be impossible to comprehensively engage their\nwork without looking at their philosophical work on religious beliefs:\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650), Thomas Hobbes\n(1588\u20131679), Anne Conway (1631\u20131679), Baruch Spinoza\n(1632\u20131677), Margaret Cavendish (1623\u20131673), Gottfried\nLeibniz (1646\u20131716), John Locke (1632\u20131704), George\nBerkeley (1685\u20131753), David Hume (1711\u20131776), Immanuel\nKant (1724\u20131804), and G.W.F. Hegel (1770\u20131831) (the list\nis partial). And in the twentieth century, one should make note of the\nimportant philosophical work by Continental philosophers on matters of\nreligious significance: Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976), Jean-Paul\nSartre (1905\u20131980), Simone de Beauvoir (1908\u20131986), Albert\nCamus (1913\u20131960), Gabriel Marcel (1889\u20131973), Franz\nRosenzweig (1886\u20131929), Martin Buber (1878\u20131956), Emmanuel\nLevinas (1906\u20131995), Simone Weil (1909\u20131943) and, more\nrecently Jacques Derrida (1930\u20132004), Michel Foucault\n(1926\u20131984), and Luce Irigaray (1930\u2013). Evidence of\nphilosophers taking religious matters seriously can also be found in\ncases of when thinkers who would not (normally) be classified as\nphilosophers of religion have addressed religion, including A.N.\nWhitehead (1861\u20131947), Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970), G.E.\nMoore (1873\u20131958), John Rawls (1921\u20132002), Bernard\nWilliams (1929\u20132003), Hilary Putnam (1926\u20132016), Derek\nParfit (1942\u20132017), Thomas Nagel (1937\u2013), J\u00fcrgen\nHabermas (1929\u2013), and others. Chris Firestone and Nathan Jacobs\nhave done recent work highlighting the immense work on religions by\nmodern philosophers that are sometimes ignored in secular histories of\nphilosophy (see their The Persistence of the Sacred in Modern\nThought).\n\nIn Chinese and Indian philosophy there is an even greater challenge\nthan in the West to distinguish important philosophical and religious\nsources of philosophy of religion. It would be difficult to classify\nNagarjuna (150\u2013250 CE) or Adi Shankara (788\u2013820 CE) as\nexclusively philosophical or religious thinkers. Their work seems as\nequally important philosophically as it is religiously (see\nRanganathan 2018).\n\nFourth, a comprehensive study of theology or religious studies also\nprovides good reasons to have expertise in philosophy of religion. As\njust observed, Asian philosophy and religious thought are intertwined\nand so the questions engaged in philosophy of religion seem relevant:\nwhat is space and time? Are there many things or one reality? Might\nour empirically observable world be an illusion? Could the world be\ngoverned by Karma? Is reincarnation possible? In terms of the West,\nthere is reason to think that even the sacred texts of the Abrahamic\nfaith involve strong philosophical elements: In Judaism, Job is\nperhaps the most explicitly philosophical text in the Hebrew Bible.\nThe wisdom tradition of each Abrahamic faith may reflect broader\nphilosophical ways of thinking; the Christian New Testament seems to\ninclude or address Platonic themes (the Logos, the soul and body\nrelationship). Much of Islamic thought includes critical reflection on\nPlato, Aristotle, Plotinus, as well as independent philosophical\nwork.\n\nLet us now turn to the way philosophers have approached the meaning of\nreligious beliefs.\n",
