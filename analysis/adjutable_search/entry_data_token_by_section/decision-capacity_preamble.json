    "main_text": "\n\nIn many Western jurisdictions the law presumes that adult persons, and\nsometimes children that meet certain criteria, are capable of making\ntheir own medical decisions; for example, consenting to a particular\nmedical treatment, or consenting to participate in a research trial.\nBut what exactly does it mean to say that a subject has or lacks the\nrequisite capacity to decide? This question has to do with what is\ncommonly called \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d, a central concept\nin health care law and ethics, and increasingly an independent topic\nof philosophical inquiry.\n\nDecisional capacity can be defined as the ability of subjects to make\ntheir own medical decisions. Somewhat similar questions of capacity\narise in other contexts, such as capacity to stand trial in a court of\nlaw and the ability to make decisions that relate to personal care and\nfinances. However, the history behind the more general legal notions\nof capacity to stand trial and capacity to manage one\u2019s life is\ndifferent and operates somewhat differently in law (Roth, Meisel,\n& Litz 1977; Zapf & Roesch 2005). For the purposes of this\ndiscussion the notion of decisional capacity will be limited to\nmedical contexts only; most notably, those where decisions to consent\nor to refuse treatment or participation in clinical research are\nconcerned.\n\nThis makes sense given that the current notion of decisional capacity\nin health care arose with, and remains closely tied to, the doctrine\nof informed consent. Informed consent is both a moral concept and a\nlegal practice that arose in the second half of the twentieth century\nin response to the widespread paternalism of physicians and clinical\nresearchers. It was only once patients and research subjects began to\nbe involved in making their own decisions that it became clear to many\nthat some sort of fair, formal method was needed for distinguishing\nbetween those who can make their own decisions (and so ought to be\nallowed to) and those who can\u2019t make their own decisions (and so\nshould not be expected to) (Kim 2010: 11\u201314).\n\nIt is fairly obvious that some individuals cannot make their own\ndecisions: persons who are unconscious (temporarily or permanently),\nindividuals with severe brain damage, infants and very small children,\nthose who are born with severe cognitive impairment, and those in the\nadvanced stages of dementia. We do these individuals no favor by\npretending that they can decide for themselves. Instead, we must try\nto look out for these vulnerable individuals in our midst, and to the\nextent possible, ensure that their perspectives are taken into account\nin making decisions for them (Silvers & Francis 2009). But these\nare the \u201ceasy\u201d cases. The more difficult task is to\ndevelop a fair and consistent notion of decisional capacity that\napplies to the more subtle cases, the ones in which individuals have\nsome but not all of the mental capacities of ordinary adult agents. It\nis a moral failure if we say of someone who lacks decisional capacity\nthat she has it, for then we fail to protect someone who genuinely\ncannot decide for herself. But it is also a serious moral failure to\nsay of someone who has decisional capacity that she lacks it, for we\nthen deprive someone of a very important moral power: the power to\ndirect her own life through making her own decisions (Buchanan &\nBrock 1989: 40\u201341; Kim 2010: 1). Those who tackle the issue of\ncapacity face moral danger of various types, and there is no easy way\nto avoid all moral pitfalls all the time.\n\nDespite the dangers, theoretical questions about decisional capacity\nremain extremely important because they have huge practical\nimplications. Indeed, it is the combined theoretical and practical\nnature of decisional capacity that makes it so intellectually\ncompelling to philosophers who write about it. But this is still\nlargely uncultivated philosophical territory. One reason is the highly\ninterdisciplinary and rapidly changing nature of the field. Clinical\nmethods and tests to assess capacity are proliferating even as\ndisagreements remain about whether these instruments track what is\ntruly important. Philosophers have much to contribute, but they must\ntread carefully if their contributions are to be timely and\nrelevant.\n",
