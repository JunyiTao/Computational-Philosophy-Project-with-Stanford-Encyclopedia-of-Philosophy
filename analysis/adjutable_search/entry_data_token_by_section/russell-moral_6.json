Russell\u2019s Ideal: the Influence of Spinoza\n\nBefore going on to discuss Russell\u2019s meta-ethic in more detail, it is\nworth pausing for a moment to consider his ideal. For although Russell\nclaimed to make his \u201cpractical moral judgments\u201d on a\n\u201croughly hedonistic basis\u201d (RoE:\n165\u20136/Papers 11: 311), he was far from being an out-and\nout hedonist. He was, as we have seen, a utilitarian of sorts, who\nbelieved that the right thing to do is the action that, on the\navailable evidence, seems likely to produce the best balance of good\nover evil consequences. Since we cannot perform the requisite\ncalculations in every case, we need codes of conduct, though these\nshould be taken with a pinch of salt and reassessed from time to time\nin the light of new information. This is sensible and humane, but\nperhaps a little pedestrian. However Russell\u2019s conception of the\ngood\u2014the end to be promoted\u2014is a bit more interesting. To\nbegin with, although he valued human happiness, he did not see this in\ncrudely hedonistic terms. However pleasurable the life of a pig may\nbe, Russell would not have preferred the life of a pig to that of a\nhuman being. Russell also valued passion and a life which\nallowed for spontaneous (but \u201ccreative\u201d) impulses. These\nviews distinguish him from the classical utilitarians who he otherwise\nadmired. However, the really distinctive features of Russell\u2019s ethic\nwere derived from Spinoza (1632\u20131677), who remained a\nphilosophical hero even though Russell rejected most of his\nmetaphysics as set out (rather confusingly) in his Ethics of\n1677. There was something about Spinoza\u2019s attitude to life that\nRussell regarded as profoundly right. Kenneth Blackwell calls this\n\u201cthe ethic of impersonal self-enlargement\u201d (Blackwell\n1985: 17). According to this ideal, the best life is lived in\nawareness of the Other. This includes other selves (since Russell\nconsidered a purely selfish life unfulfilling, and a life without\nhistory\u2014which involves knowledge of other\nselves\u2014drab) but also the wholly other\u2014the\nnon-human universe of large impersonal forces, the wind, the sea, the\nmountains and the stars and even (if they exist) the entities of\nmathematics. He felt that the self is enlarged by the contemplation of\nthe not-self and that the person whose concerns are limited to their\nown states of mind has confined themself within a spiritual prison. By\nthe same token, a philosophy that reduces reality to an emanation\neither of the self or of the collective reduces the self by denying it\naccess to the Other. All this may sound unduly elevated, but in\npractice what this means is that the good person takes an interest in\nother people (including people who may not be connected with them) and\nin the world at large. Russell sometimes talks about contemplation in\nthis connection, but this should not be understood as a purely passive\nprocess. The contemplative person does not just sit and stare (though\nRussell was not averse to this kind of contemplation) but actively\nseeks to know the Other through science, history and other forms of\nenquiry. Thus Russell\u2019s distaste for idealism and for anti-realist and\ninstrumentalist philosophies of science is connected with his ideal of\nimpersonal self-enlargement. Of course Russell does not attempt to\nderive an Is (such as the claim that idealism or pragmatism\nis false) from an Ought (such as the claim that we\nought to enlarge the Self through contemplation of the Other,\nsomething that would be difficult if either of these philosophies were\ncorrect). But he does suggest that there is something morally suspect,\nas well as wrong-headed, about attempts to reduce the vast forces of\nnature to human experience or to useful predictive devices enabling\nhuman beings to achieve their puny ends. For Russell the good life is\na life that looks outward, which is one reason for his dislike of\nphilosophies that diminish what is outside ourselves into something\nnot worth looking at.
