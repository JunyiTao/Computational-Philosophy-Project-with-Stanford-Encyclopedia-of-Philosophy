    "main_text": "\n\n\nQuestions central to the ontology of art include the following: what\nsort of things are works of art? Do all works of art belong to a\nsingle category of entities?  Do they have multiple instances? Do\nworks have parts or constituents, and if so, what is their relation to\nthe work as a whole? How are works of art individuated? Are they\ncreated or discovered?  Can they be destroyed?\n\n\nExplicit and extensive treatments of these topics written\nprior to the 19th century have yet to be found. This does\nnot mean, however, that there is nothing relevant to these ontological\nquestions in early writings on beauty, the arts, and related\nmatters. For example, Aristotle\u2019s claims about the functions and\nelements of tragedy (see Gerald Else 1957) can be mined for ideas\nabout the nature of literary and dramatic works more generally. And\nwhat can be made of the hint, in Metaphysics Eta, 6, that the\nunity of The Iliad is a matter of a set of words made\n\u201cone\u201d by being connected together?\n\n\nRather than attempting to make conjectures about such difficult\nexegetical topics, this entry focuses primarily on contributions made\nby authors who explicitly address themselves at length to some of the\naforementioned questions pertaining directly to the ontology of works\nof art, either in general or with reference to such major art forms as\nmusic, literature, painting, architecture, and sculpture.\n\n\nOne further note about the scope of this entry is in\norder. Instructive surveys of the subfield of aesthetics known as the\nontology of art are fairly plentiful; see Nicholas Wolterstorff\n(1992), Gregory Currie (1998, 2010), Joseph Margolis (1998), Stephen\nDavies (2003a), Amie Thomasson (2004, 2006b), Guy Rohrbaugh (2005),\nTheodore Gracyk (2009), Robert Stecker (2010), and Carl Matheson and\nBen Caplan (2011). Surveys of the history of the field have\nnot, however, been forthcoming, and the comments on this topic that\ncrop up in the literature are sketchy and sometimes quite\nmisleading. One shortcoming has been a marked tendency to focus on\nvery recent contributions, the one salient exception being due\nattention paid to works by Roman Ingarden (e.g., 1931, 1962, and see\nthe entry on Ingarden). Accordingly, the present entry focuses\nprimarily on contributions made in the 19th and\n20th centuries and the first decade of the 21st. \n",
