    "main_text": "Notable Figures\n2. Notable Figures\n\nFor much of the Song-Ming period, Confucian thought and textual\nstudies were a significant part of the lives of most adult males who\nhad a formal education. Those who wanted a career in government\nservice were required to memorize and produce learned essays on the\nConfucian classics for their civil service exams, and scholarly\ndiscourse was replete with discussions of and allusions to Confucian\nthought. The Song-Ming period was thus a particularly vibrant one for\nConfucian philosophy. Two of the earliest intellectual histories of\nthis period describe the lives and thought of more than two thousand\nConfucians who played some significant role in shaping the tradition\n(SYXA; MRXA). What follows is a brief description of\nthe philosophers who loom largest. In most cases these are the\nthinkers who had the greatest influence on Neo-Confucianism, although\nwe will also see some who, while less influential historically, now\nattract a great deal of scholarly interest for their originality or\nsophistication.\n",
