    "main_text": "Montague Semantics\n10. Montague Semantics\nNow that we have a whole hierarchy of propositional functions, we\nshould find some work for them to do. One theory in which\npropositional functions do good work is Montague semantics, developed\nin the late 1960s by Richard Montague.\nIn order to understand Montague's method we need to\nunderstand lambda abstraction. For the formula\nA(x) we read the expression\n\u03bbx[A(x)] as a predicate expression. It\nextension (in a given possible world) is the set of things that\nsatisfy the formula\nA(x). Lambda abstractors are governed by two rules,\nknown as \u03b1-conversion and \u03b2-reduction:\n\n(\u03b1-con) A(a) (a formula with a free\nfor x) can be replaced by\n\u03bbx[A(x)]a.\n\n(\u03b2-red)\n\u03bbx[A(x)]a can be replaced by\nA(a) (where x is free for a\nin A(x)).\nBecause of the equivalence between a formula A(x) and\n\u03bbx[A(x)]a, one might wonder why add\nlambda abstractors to our language. In Montague semantics, the answer\nhas to do with the very direct way that he translates expressions of\nnatural languages into his logical language. We will discuss that\nsoon, but first let us learn a bit about Montague's\nintensional logic.\nMontague adds two other pieces of notation to his\nlanguage: \u2227 and  \u2228. The\nexpression \u2227\u03bbx[Fx] represents\na function from worlds to sets of individuals. Given a possible world\nw, \u2227\u03bbx[Fx] represents a function that takes\nw to the extension of \u03bbx[Fx]. The\noperator \u2228 takes expressions of the form\n\u2227\u03bbx[Fx] \u2018down\u2019 to\ntheir extensions at the world in which the expression is being\nevaluated. For example, the extension of\n\u2228\u2227\u03bbx[Fx]\nat w is just the same as the extension of\n\u03bbx[Fx] at w.\nWhat is so special about Montague semantics is that it can be used\nin a very direct way as a semantics for large fragments of natural\nlanguages. Consider the following sentence:\n\nZermela barks.\nThe meaning of this sentence is understood in Montague\nsemantics as a structure of the meanings of its constituent\nexpressions. Montague represents the meanings of expressions using\ntranslation rules. Here we use the following translation rules:\n\nZermela translates into\n\u03bbP[(\u2228P)z]\n\nbarks translates\ninto \u2227B\nNow we can construct a formula that gives the meaning\nof \u2018Zermela barks\u2019:\n\n\u03bbP[(\u2228P)z]\u2227B\nNotice that in constructing the sentence we place the\nexpressions in the same order in which they occur in English. The use\nof lambda abstracts allows us to reverse the order of two expressions\nfrom the way in which they would appear in ordinary statements of a\nformal logical language (that does not have lambdas). Now we can use\n\u03b2-reduction to obtain:\n\n(\u2228\u2227B)z\nAnd now we apply Montague's rule to\neliminate \u2228\u2227:\n\nBz\nIn this process we start with an expression that has the same order\nof expressions as the original English sentence and then reduce it to\na very standard formula of logic. This tells us that the truth\ncondition of the sentence \u2018Zermela barks\u2019 is the set of\nworlds that is the proposition expressed by Bz. Of course we\nknew that independently of Montague's work, but the point is that the\nMontague reduction shows us how we can connect the surface grammar of\nEnglish sentences to the formula of our logical language. The formula\nof standard logic, moreover, displays its truth-conditions in a very\nperspicuous way. So, the Montague reduction shows us the connection\nbetween sentences of natural languages to their truth conditions.\n",
