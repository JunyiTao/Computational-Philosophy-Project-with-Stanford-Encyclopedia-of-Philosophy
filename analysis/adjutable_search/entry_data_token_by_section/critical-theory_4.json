This work combined philosophy, social theory, and\npsychoanalytic theory with empirical research.\n\nThe first substantial foray was Studies in Authority and the\nFamily (Horkheimer 1936b), the product of five years of research\ncarried out by members of the Institute as part of the research agenda\noutlined by Horkheimer when he became director in 1930. In an essay\narticulating the study\u2019s theoretical framework, Erich Fromm\nargued that the \u201cdrives underlying the authoritarian\ncharacter\u201d are \u201cthe pleasure of obedience, submission, and\nthe surrender of one\u2019s personality\u201d along with\n\u201caggression against the defenseless and sympathy with the\npowerful\u201d (Fromm 1936 [2020, 39, 41]). A main concern of the\nStudies was that the nuclear family had lost the power it\nonce had to counter other socializing forces, which could now more\ndirectly influence the individual, and that individuals who view the\nworld as governed by irrational forces submit to powerful leaders who\nease their feelings of powerlessness.\n\nThe focus on authoritarianism continued into exile, with Neumann and\nKirchheimer focusing more on distinctly political phenomena such as\nlaw, the state structure, and competing political groups under the\nNazi regime (see Neumann 1944, Scheuerman 1996). Neumann and\nKirchheimer were the main legal and political analysts of the first\ngeneration, but were outside the inner circle and less influential on\nthe trajectory the Frankfurt School took in the 1940s (see Scheuerman\n1994 and Buchstein 2020 for attempts to revive interest in their legal\nand political analysis).\n\nThe work on authoritarianism that the Institute is most well-known for\ncame with the publication of The Authoritarian Personality\n(1950), the result of research conducted by Adorno in collaboration\nwith a team of psychologists at the University of California,\nBerkeley. The aim was to identify personality types that might be\nsusceptible to authoritarianism, based not on explicit commitments to\nfascist political movements but on psychological characteristics and\nsocial attitudes (measured on an \u201cF-scale\u201d). The\nresearchers posited that individuals with an authoritarian personality\ntend to exhibit traits such as rigid conformity to conventional norms,\na tendency toward stereotypical thinking, a preference for strong\nauthority figures and disdain for perceived weakness, a preoccupation\nwith power and status, and a propensity for prejudice and hostility\ntowards minority groups. The book explored the link between\nauthoritarianism and antisemitism, highlighting the role of\nscapegoating and the projection of repressed aggression onto targeted\nminority groups.\n\nThe text was published in a series edited by Horkheimer, titled\nStudies in Prejudice, along with other innovative studies\nsuch as Prophets of Deceit: A Study of the Techniques of the\nAmerican Agitator (1949), a psychoanalytic analysis of the\nrhetoric and tropes of American demagogues authored by Frankfurt\nSchool member Leo L\u00f6wenthal and Norbert Guterman. If The\nAuthoritarian Personality studied the kinds of people potentially\nreceptive to the messages of authoritarian leaders, Prophets of\nDeceit studied the content of the messaging itself. Adorno would\nlater follow up on all these themes \u2013 both the form and content\nof fascist agitation and the social and psychological conditions under\nwhich it can succeed (1951b, 1967a).\n\nThe Authoritarian Personality had a major impact on the field\nof political sociology, inspiring a wave of similar studies and\ncommentary. The recent resurgence of authoritarian populism has\ninspired renewed interest in Frankfurt School analysis of\nauthoritarianism (see\n Section 4.2\n below) in conjunction with publication of new editions of some of the\nclassic texts along with previously untranslated work by Kracauer on\ntotalitarian propaganda dating from the late 1930s (Kracauer 2013\n[2022]) and a 1967 lecture by Adorno on \u201cAspects of the New\nRight-Wing Extremism\u201d (Adorno 1967a [2020]).\n\nOne point of continuity between the studies of authoritarianism and\nFrankfurt School cultural analysis more broadly was the idea that\n\u201cmass culture\u201d was one of the powerful forces playing an\nincreasing role in the direct socialization of individuals, a role\nthat led to the \u201cdisappearance of the inner life\u201d of the\nindividual (Horkheimer 1941) and an increasing loss of the ability to\nimagine a world any different than the existing one. In its various\nforms, this general thesis was common to Horkheimer, Adorno, and\nMarcuse in their critiques of mass culture from the 1930s to the\n1960s.\n\nMore generally, the Frankfurt School is known for its analysis of\npopular culture. By contrast to orthodox Marxist dismissal of cultural\nanalysis for focusing on the less consequential\n\u201csuperstructure\u201d of society, Frankfurt School theorists\nattentively analyzed the form and content of cultural objects along\nwith the genres and modes of producing works of art and popular\nculture. In an early essay titled \u201cMass Ornament\u201d (1927),\nKracauer argued that analyzing the \u201cinconspicuous surface-level\nexpressions\u201d of an epoch, by virtue of their \u201cunconscious\nnature,\u201d can disclose its \u201cfundamental substance\u201d\nand \u201cunheeded impulses\u201d (1927 [1975, 75]). Adorno would\nlater maintain that \u201ccultural criticism must become social\nphysiognomy\u201d (1951a [1967, 30]), a method he pursued in his\ninterpretations of works of literature and music by interpreting the\nsurface features and forms of various cultural artifacts in relation\nto underlying social conditions as a mode of disclosive critique.\n\nThe more pessimistic analysis of mass culture of Horkheimer, Adorno,\nand Marcuse can be distinguished from the more optimistic views\ndeveloped by Kracauer and Walter Benjamin. Benjamin posited, in his\nfamous essay, \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Technological\nReproducibility\u201d (1936), that the rise of technologies for\nmechanical reproduction, such as photography and film, led to the\ndecline of the \u201caura\u201d surrounding traditional works of art\n\u2013 the \u201cauthenticity\u201d associated with the unique\npresence of the original in space and time \u2013 in part because it\nmakes no sense to talk about the \u201coriginal\u201d version of a\nphotograph. The resulting changes in perception and modes of\ncollective experience and participation in cultural production could,\nBenjamin hoped, also bring about political forms of art and a more\ngeneral democratization of culture. He contrasted this emancipatory\npotential of mass culture, through a politicization of aesthetics,\nwith the aestheticization of politics under fascism (Buck-Morss 1992).\nAdorno expressed his disagreement in an earlier letter to Benjamin and\nin published work (Adorno 1936, 1938). As Wellmer puts it, \u201cin\ntechnologized mass culture, Benjamin sees elements of an antidote to\nthe psychic destruction of society, whereas Adorno regards it above\nall as a medium of conformism and psychic manipulation\u201d (1985/86\n[1991, 32\u201333]). While Benjamin placed hope in mass culture,\nAdorno saw it lying in the kind of autonomous art that resists\nreconciling subjects to their social world, instead offering a kind of\n\u201cpromise of happiness\u201d in a transfigured future that lies\nbeyond that social world (Adorno 1970, Finlayson 2015, Gordon\n2023).\n",
