    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nBradley was born on 30th January, 1846 in Clapham (then in the county\nof Surrey, since absorbed into a much expanded London). He was the\nfourth child and eldest surviving son of Charles Bradley, a prominent\nEvangelical preacher, and his second wife, Emma Linton. The family was\ntalented and well connected: George Granville Bradley, a son from the\nfirst marriage, was successively Head Master of Marlborough College,\nMaster of University College, Oxford, and Dean of Westminster Abbey;\nA.C. Bradley, a younger son from the second marriage, taught\nphilosophy at Oxford until 1881, and, after moving to literary\nstudies, held chairs at Liverpool and Glasgow, refused one at\nCambridge, and became the most distinguished Shakespearean critic of\nhis day. Charles Bradley\u2019s \u2018Clapham Sect\u2019 (as this\nactively evangelical humanitarian group was known at the time) had\nstrong imperial connections, including among its members a\nGovernor-General of Bengal, a Governor of Sierra Leone, several\nmembers of Parliament and a permanent head of the Colonial Office.\n\nIn 1856 F.H. Bradley\u2019s schooling began at Cheltenham College; in\n1861 he was transferred to Marlborough College, then under his\nhalf-brother\u2019s Headship. While at Cheltenham he began learning\nGerman; he read at least some of Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure\nReason while still at school, though it is not clear that this\nwas in the original language. In the winter of 1862\u20133 he\ncontracted typhoid fever (at one stage expected to kill him), followed\nshortly by pneumonia. Surviving both, he was protected from further\nexposure to the rigours of English public school life by leaving\nMarlborough in 1863.\n\nIn 1865 Bradley entered University College, Oxford, as a Scholar,\ngetting a first in classical moderations (Mods) in 1867 but only an\nunexpected second in literae humaniores (Greats) in 1869. The\nprominent Plato scholar A.E. Taylor, a later admirer of Bradley and\nsympathetic to his idealism, attributed his reverse in Greats to\n\u2018the complete incapacity of examiners whose philosophical\nscriptures were the writings of John Stuart Mill to comprehend what\nphilosophy meant to the brilliant younger men who were shortly to\nrevolutionize philosophical studies in Great Britain.\u2019 Whether\nor not this is true, there is certainly an undisguised contempt for\nMill and his followers exhibited in Bradley\u2019s Principles of\nLogic. After more than one failure to obtain a college\nfellowship, he was in December 1870 elected to one at Merton College\nOxford, tenable for life, with no teaching duties, and terminable only\non marriage. He never married, and remained in his fellowship until\nhis death.\n\nIn June 1871 Bradley suffered a severe inflammation of the kidneys\nwhich appears to have had permanent effects. It has been suggested,\npossibly with malice, that the Bradleys in general were disposed to\nhypochondria; be that as it may, he was prone thereafter to be\nincapacitated by cold, physical exhaustion or anxiety, and in\nconsequence lived a retired life. He took an active part in the\nrunning of his college, but avoided public occasions, to the extent,\nfor example, of declining an invitation to become a founding member of\nthe British Academy. Collingwood records of Bradley in his\nAutobiography, \u2018[A]lthough I lived within a few hundred\nyards of him for sixteen years, I never to my knowledge set eyes on\nhim.\u2019 This relative seclusion added an element of mystery to his\nphilosophical reputation, a mystery enhanced by the dedication of some\nof his books to a person identified only by the initials\n\u2018E.R.\u2019\n\nBut although Bradley devoted himself to philosophy, so that the\nhistory of his public life is largely that of his books and articles,\nit is clear that his was not a narrowly bookish existence. To protect\nhis health, he frequently escaped the damp chill of Oxford winters for\nthe kinder weather of southern English and Mediterranean seaside\nresorts. (In the course of one of these travels Bradley met an\nAmerican engineer named Radcliff, and fell in love with one of his\ndaughters, the mysterious E.R. of the dedications.) His metaphysics, a\nstriking combination of the rational and the mystical, makes more than\ngrudging room for the life of the senses and emotions, and his\nwritings, especially his posthumously published Aphorisms,\ncould not be the work of a man whose experience had been confined to\nthe study. He liked guns and disliked cats, indulging his preferences\neconomically by using the former to shoot the latter in the college\ngrounds at night.\n\nBradley\u2019s political views are said to have been conservative,\nthough not of a narrowly doctrinaire kind. Although his writings\nreveal a religious temperament, he seems (judging by a letter of 1922)\nto have found the evangelical religiosity of his father\u2019s\nhousehold oppressive, and, perhaps in consequence, the attitude to\nChristianity displayed later in his writings exhibits a certain\nambivalence; on the whole, he appears to have been a freethinker. (To\nimagine growing up amongst the members of the Clapham Sect, we might\nuse John Sutherland\u2019s suggestion that the characters of Edmund\nand Fanny in Jane Austen\u2019s Mansfield Park give us some\nidea of what they would have been like.)\n\nBradley\u2019s public recognition included the conferring of the\nhonorary degree LL.D. by the University of Glasgow (1883), election to\nmembership of the Royal Danish Academy (1921), of the Accademia\ndei Lincei and the Reale Istituto Lombardo of Milan\n(1922), and election to an Honorary Fellowship of the British Academy\n(1923). In 1924, King George V bestowed on him, the first philosopher\nto be singled out for this very rare honour, the Order of Merit. Three\nmonths later, after a few days\u2019 illness, he died from blood\npoisoning on 18th September, 1924. He is buried in Holywell Cemetery,\nOxford.\n",
