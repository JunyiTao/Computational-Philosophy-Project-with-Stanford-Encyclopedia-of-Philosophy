    "main_text": "The Semantics of Natural Kind Terms || Descriptivism and Internalism\n4.1 Descriptivism and Internalism\n\nThe modern tradition of natural kinds begins with J. S. Mill (1884)\nwho talked of \u2018Kinds\u2019 (the term \u2018natural kind\u2019\nis traced by Hacking (1991a) back to Mill\u2019s contemporary, the\nlogician John Venn (1866)). According to Mill, typical singular\n(individual) names such as \u2018Scott\u2019 denote their\nreferents but lack any connotation, that is to say the names\ndo not imply any attribute. Some singular names do have connotation as\nwell as denotation, for example \u2018the author of Waverley\u2019.\nA general name, such as \u2018white\u2019, denotes all the things\nthey hold of (its extension) while also connoting the attribute they\nall share in common. Natural kind terms are a special case of general\nterms in this respect\n\nThe idea that something such as a connotation determines the extension\nof a term is elaborated in Frege\u2019s notion of sense and,\nlater, that of intension. Frege and later philosophers have\napplied this view to singular proper names, and views of this sort\nfall under the general heading of \u2018descriptivism\u2019. Russell\nis also often referred to in this regard, but it should be remembered\nthat Russell\u2019s view is that grammatically proper names are\nabbreviations of quantified expressions and so do not have any\nreferring role at all (and so a fortiori they do not have a\nreferring role that is meditated by a connotation/sense/intension).\nSome neo-Fregeans nevertheless deny that Fregean senses should be\ncashed out as descriptions (e.g., McDowell 1977; Evans 1982).\n\nMill\u2019s descriptivism implies that for each natural kind term\nthere is an associated set of properties such that for some item to be\na member of that natural kind, it should possess those\nproperties\u2014these are properties that describe objects belonging\nto the kind in question. Implicit in Mill and explicit in Frege is the\nclaim that these descriptions are constitutive of the meaning of the\nterm in the following way: someone who understands the term adequately\nwill be in a position to grasp a priori that something falls\nunder the kind term if and only if it satisfies that description. For\nthis reason the relevant properties will normally be readily\nobservable properties of things; they will not be properties\nassociated with the kind only by a posteriori investigation.\nFor example, as mentioned above, Kant held the view that it is a\npriori that something falls under the kind term gold\nonly if it is a yellow metal. Because the extension-fixing meaning of\na term is thus graspable a priori this view is\ninternalist about extension fixing. The extensions of kind\nterms of any two subjects with the same internal mental states will\nhave (in the same context) the same extensions.\n",
