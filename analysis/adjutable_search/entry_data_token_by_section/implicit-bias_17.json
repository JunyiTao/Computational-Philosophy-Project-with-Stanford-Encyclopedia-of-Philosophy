    "main_text": "Critical Responses || Implicit vs. Explicit\n5.2 Implicit vs. Explicit\nSome have argued that explicit bias can explain much of what\nimplicit bias purports to explain (e.g., Hermanson 2017a,b, 2018\n(Other Internet Resources); Singal 2017; Buckwalter 2018). Jesse\nSingal (2017), for example, denies that implicit bias is more\nimportant than explicit bias, pointing to the United States Department\nof Justice\u2019s findings about intentional race-based\ndiscrimination in Ferguson, MO and to the fact that the United States\nelected a relatively explicitly racist President in 2016.\n\n\nSingal and others are surely right that explicit bias and outright\nprejudice are persistent and, in some places, pervasive. It is,\nhowever, unclear who, if anyone, thinks that implicit bias is more\nimportant than explicit bias. Philosophers in particular have been\ninterested in implicit bias because, despite the persistence and\npervasiveness of explicit bias, there are many people\u2014presumably\nmany of those reading this article\u2014who aim to think and act in\nunprejudiced ways, and yet are susceptible to the kinds of biased\nbehavior implicit bias researchers have studied. This is not only an\nimportant phenomenon in its own right, but also may contribute causally\nto the mainstream complacence toward the very outrageous instances of\nbigotry Singal discusses. Implicit bias may also contribute causally to\nexplicit bias, particularly in environments suffused with prejudiced\nnorms (Madva 2019).\nA related worry is that there is not agreement in the literature\nabout what \u201cimplicit\u201d means. Arguably the most common\nunderstanding is that \u201cimplicit\u201d means\n\u201cunconscious.\u201d But whatever is assessed by implicit\nmeasures is arguably not unconscious (\u00a73.1).\nIt is true that there is no widespread agreement about the meaning\nof \u201cimplicit,\u201d and it is also true that no theory of\nimplicit social cognition is consistent with all the current data. To\nwhat extent this is a problem depends on background theories about how\nscience progresses. It is also crucial to recognize that implicit\nmeasures are not high-fidelity assessments of any one distinct\n\u201cpart\u201d of the mind. They are not process pure (\u00a71.2).\nThis means that they capture a mix of various cognitive and affective\nprocesses. Included in this mix are people\u2019s beliefs and explicit\nattitudes. Indeed, researchers have known for some time that the best\nway to predict a person\u2019s scores on an implicit measure like the\nIAT is to ask them their opinions about the IAT\u2019s targets. This\ndoes not mean that implicit measures lack \u201cdiscriminant\nvalidity,\u201d however (i.e., that they are redundant with existing\nmeasures). By analogy, you are likely to find that people who say that\ncilantro is disgusting are likely to have aversive reactions to it, but\nthis doesn\u2019t mean that their aversive reactions are an invalid\nconstruct. Indeed, one of the leading theories of the dynamics and\nprocesses of implicit social cognition since 2006\u2014APE\n(\u00a72.2)\u2014is based on a set of predictions about this process\nimpurity (i.e., about the interactions of implicit and explicit\nevaluative processes).\n",
