The Distinction between Ideas and Sensations\n\nIn the last section, we learned that there are no particular things in\nGod, but what about particular ideas? Malebranche sometimes\nwrites as if there are, and one commentator has argued that he was\ncommitted to such a view in the first edition of the Search\n(Gueroult 1955\u20139, vol. 1, 63f). This has since been disputed\n(see Schmaltz 2000, 72 and note 39), but whatever the case,\nMalebranche tends in later editions of the Search and in his\nlater writings generally to treat ideas as general and abstract. This\nis true both of the various geometrical ideas that we see in God and\nof the idea of extension: \u2018when I said that we see different\nbodies through the knowledge we have of God\u2019s perfections that\nrepresent them, I did not exactly mean that there are in God certain\nparticular ideas that represent each body individually \u2026\u2019\n(Elucidation 10, OC:154; LO 627). Beginning with the\nElucidations, Malebranche employs the term\n\u2018intelligible extension\u2019 to denote the general idea of\nextension, and to distinguish it from actual extension, which again is\nunintelligible in itself. In addition to being general, ideas\nin God are also \u2018pure\u2019 in the Cartesian sense that they\nare non-sensuous. Intelligible extension, then, is just the idea of\ngeometrical extension and its properties, or what in the\nseventeenth-century came to be known as the \u2018primary\nqualities.\u2019 Malebranche reduces these to two \u2013 figure\n(i.e., size and shape) and motion.\n\nThese two characteristic features of ideas raise the following\nquestions:\n\n\nIf intelligible extension is pure, then how can it represent\nsensible objects? Following Descartes, Malebranche wanted to\nhighlight the intellectual character of sense perception, but has he\ndone so at the expense of its sensory component?\n\nSupposing that intelligible extension does represent sensible objects\nhow, as a general idea, can it represent particular\nobjects?\n\n\nTo answer these questions we must first uncover an important\ndistinction that Malebranche draws between ideas on the one hand and\nsensations on the other. As we have already discovered, ideas are in\nGod and are cosubstantial with his substance. Sensations of colors,\nsounds, odors, heat, pleasure, etc., on the other hand, are\nmodifications of finite minds. Another important difference is that\nideas are intrinsically representational, whereas sensations are not.\nThe idea of a pyramid, for example, represents an actual pyramid in\nthe sense that it resembles it, but the sensation of pain that one\nexperience\u2019s when, say, accidentally lacerating one\u2019s arm,\nin no way resembles the wounded tissue. Ideas and sensations, then,\nare very different kinds of entity, but Malebranche maintains that\nsense perception combines elements of each.\n\n\nWhen we perceive something sensible, two things are found in our\nperception: sensation and pure idea. The sensation\nis a modification of our soul, and it is God who causes it in us. As\nfor the idea found in conjunction with the sensation, it is in God,\nand we see it because it pleases God to reveal it to us.\n(Search 3.2.6, OC 1:445; LO 234)\n\n\nThe composite character of sense perception provides answers to both\nof our questions. Malebranche explains:\n\n\nintelligible extension becomes visible and represents a certain body\nin particular only by means of color, because it is only by the\nvariety of colors that we judge the difference between the objects we\nsee\u2026. [A]s the sensations of color are essentially different,\nby means of them we judge the variety of bodies. If I distinguish your\nhand from your coat and both from the air surrounding them, this is\nbecause the sensations of light or color that I have of them are very\ndifferent (Dialogue 1, OC 12:46\u20137; JS 17).\n\nwe see or sense a given body when its ideas, i.e., when some figure\ncomposed of intelligible and general extension, becomes sensible and\nparticular through color or some other sensible perception by which\nits idea affects the soul and that the soul ascribes to it, for the\nsoul almost always projects its sensations on an idea that strikes it\nin lively fashion. (Elucidation 10, OC 3:152; LO 626)\n\n\nIn sense perception the mind \u2018projects\u2019 its sensations\nonto intelligible extension, or some determinate part of it, thereby\nrendering sensible what is otherwise abstract and general. It was a\ncommon view in the seventeenth century that sensations of color and\nlight, in particular, also serve another function in sense perception:\nthey enable us to discriminate shapes and, correlatively, individual\nbodies. As illusionists of the age were well aware, one can make a\nwoman appear headless if her head is covered with something that\nblends into the background (such as a black hood against a black\ncurtain) and she is dressed in clothing that is color-contrasting. In\nthese passages, Malebranche applies this general point to explain how\nthe sensations of color and light individuate intelligible extension\nand thereby yield sensory perceptions of particular objects.\nSensations both \u2018sensualize\u2019 and\n\u2018particularize\u2019 intelligible extension, and thus make it\npossible for us to see particular sensible objects in it.\n\nIn characterizing the relation between ideas and sensations here,\nMalebranche relies partially on metaphors. He speaks of\n\u2018projecting\u2019 our sensations onto ideas and elsewhere he\ncompares intelligible extension to a canvas onto which sensations are\n\u2018painted\u2019 (OC 6:78). Some commentators have attempted to\nunpack these metaphors and to offer a more specific account of the\nrelation between ideas and sensations in sense perception. They\nattribute an \u2018adverbial theory\u2019 of sensation to\nMalebranche. Since sensations are nonrepresentational, they do not\nconstitute an extra object of perception over and above the general\nidea of extension and the material objects they represent. In other\nwords, we do not perceive sensations; we directly perceive ideas and\nvia these ideas we indirectly perceive corporeal objects. Given this\naccount of the intentionality of perception, sensations are best\nunderstood adverbially, that is, as a way of perceiving\nobjects in the world. For example, when observing the setting sun, it\nwould be most accurate to say not that one senses \u2018red,\u2019\nbut that one senses redly (see Jolley 2000, 37f; Nadler 1992, 64; Pyle\n2003, 57, 63\u20135 and Radner 1978, 89). However, more recent\ndiscussions have cast serious doubts on whether Malebranche could be\ncommitted to an adverbial theory of sense perception, for a variety of\ndifferent reasons (see Nolan 2012, Ott 2014, and Simmons 2009).\n\nIn addition to the roles already discussed, sensations play one other\nimportant function in Malebranche\u2019s epistemology. They provide a\nkind of \u2018natural revelation\u2019 of the existence of bodies.\nIt is important to remember here that the idea of extension in God\ndoes not reveal anything about the existence of bodies, only their\nessence. Speaking once again of the composite character of sense\nperception, he writes: \u2018There is always a clear idea and a\nconfused sensation in the view we have of sensible objects. The idea\nrepresents their essence, and the sensation informs us of their\nexistence\u2019 (Dialogue 5, OC 12:113; JS 74). More strongly,\nsensations \u2018make us judge\u2019 that there is an object in the\nworld corresponding to our perception (Elucidation 10, OC 3:143; LO\n621). \u2018God joins the sensation to the idea when objects are\npresent so that we may believe them to be present\u2026.\u2019\n(Search, 6.2.6, OC 3:152; LO 234).\n\nAlthough sensations provide a \u2018strong propensity\u2019 to\nbelieve in the existence of bodies, they do not provide conclusive\nproof or even evidence of their existence, for the senses often\ndeceive us (Elucidation 6, OC 3:55f; LO 569f). Malebranche notes, for\nexample, that \u2018our eyes represent colors to us on the surface of\nbodies and \u2026 our ears make us hear sounds as if spread out\nthrough the air and in the resounding bodies; and if we believe what\nthe senses report, heat will be in fire, sweetness will be in sugar,\nmusk will have an odor\u2026.\u2019 (ibid., OC 3:55\u20136; LO\n569). Like many of the mechanical philosophers in the seventeenth\ncentury, Malebranche holds that so-called sensible qualities (colors,\nsounds, odors, heat and cold, etc.) are not in bodies \u2013 which\nagain are to be conceived in terms of geometrical extension alone\n\u2013 but are modifications of the mind. However, his point in the\npassage cited is that the senses deceptively entice us to attribute\nthem to bodies. If they deceive us in this way, then it is at least\npossible that they also deceive us about the existence of bodies.\n\nIf the senses do not provide absolute certainty about the existence of\nbodies, one might wonder why God uses them at all for this purpose,\nespecially since Malebranche also contends \u2018faith obliges us to\nbelieve that there are bodies\u2019 (ibid., OC 3:62; LO 573). Why\nthen don\u2019t the revelations of Scripture suffice? Why do we need\nthe \u2018natural revelations\u2019 of sense? The answer is that\nlike most Cartesians, Malebranche holds that the main purpose of the\nsenses is to aid and preserve one\u2019s mind-body union. If a lion\nis chasing me or if I am in danger of being consumed by a raging fire,\nI do not need to be absolutely certain that the lion or the fire\nexists in order to know that it is in my best interests to flee. So\nwhereas faith obliges me to believe in the existence of bodies\ngenerally, sensations inform me of the existence of those particular\nbodies, such as my own body and those in its vicinity, which may\naffect it positively or negatively.\n",
