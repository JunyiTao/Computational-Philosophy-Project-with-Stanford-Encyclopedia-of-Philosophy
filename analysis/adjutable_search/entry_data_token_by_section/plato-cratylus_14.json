    "main_text": "The Etymological Section (394e\u2013421c) || The Challenge of Heracliteanism\n6.3 The Challenge of Heracliteanism\n\nWhat remains to be discussed is the idea that the etymological section\nis meant to draw attention to the ontological challenge of\nHeracliteanism. As it is clear from other dialogues like the\nTheaetetus that coming to grips with Heracliteanism is a\nphilosophical task of paramount importance for Plato, this idea is\nindeed plausible. But what, exactly, is the challenge of\nHeracliteanism? This is a very difficult and contested question. It is\nnot even clear how the notion of flux is to be construed. Some\ncommentators believe that for Plato, flux amounts to what Irwin has\ncalled \u201caspectual change\u201d (Irwin 1977). If that were true,\nthe claim that all things are in flux would be equivalent to the claim\nthat all things have opposing properties in different respects.\nHeracliteanism would then not be a theory that reduces reality to\ngenuine change and motion, but a position that is very close to (a\ncertain variety of) relativism (see, e.g., Sedley 2003:\n109\u2013112). It has also been claimed, however, that the\netymological section presents Heracliteanism as \u201ca robustly\nphysical theory according to which everything is engaged in\nspatial change, i.e. locomotion\u201d (Ademollo 2011: 233).\nIf that were the case, there would be a sharp distinction between\nHeracliteanism and relativism.\n\nIf it is controversial how the Heraclitean claim that everything is in\nflux should be construed\u2014can one at least be sure about\nPlato\u2019s assessment of this claim? He has Socrates disagree\nstrongly with Heraclitus in the etymological section (411b\u2013c);\nand later on, he has him postulate forms and thereby acknowledge the\nexistence of entities that are exempt from flux (439c\u2013440e).\nHence, Plato certainly takes Heraclitus and his followers to err\ninsofar as they overlook that there is a flux-less\nintelligible realm. But what about the sensible\nrealm\u2014the realm of the things that surround us? Might Plato not\nbelieve that these things are in flux and thus accept a restricted\nversion of Heracliteanism? The issue is once again contested: While\nsome commentators do indeed take the Cratylus to lend support\nto the venerable claim that Plato is a Heraclitean when it comes to\nsensible things (Gaiser 1974: 61\u201380; Barney 2001: 73; Sedley\n2003: 99\u2013122), it has been objected that Socrates seems to\nconsider Heracliteanism as \u201cwrong across the board\u201d in the\netymological section (Ademollo 2011: 207f.).\n\nAs these considerations show, the etymological section\u2019s\ntreatment of Heracliteanism leaves open many important questions. This\nis clearly no coincidence. Just like the whole Cratylus, the\netymological section is not aimed at providing a thorough metaphysical\ndiscussion of the ins and outs of Heracliteanism (this is, arguably,\nthe job of the Theaetetus). It illustrates, however, that\nsuch a discussion is of much greater necessity and consequence than an\ninquiry into the hidden meanings of names could ever be. And thus, it\ndovetails with the conclusion that Socrates reaches at the very end of\nhis investigation (440c\u2013d).\n",
