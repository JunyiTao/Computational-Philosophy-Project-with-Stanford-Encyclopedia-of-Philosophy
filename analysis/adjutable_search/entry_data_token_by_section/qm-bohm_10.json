    "main_text": "Spin\n11. Spin\n\nThe case of spin illustrates nicely both the way Bohmian mechanics\ntreats non-configurational quantum observables, and some of the\ndifficulties that the naive realism about operators mentioned above\ncauses. \n\nSpin is the canonical quantum observable that has no classical\ncounterpart, reputedly impossible to grasp in a nonquantum way. The\ndifficulty is not quite that spin is quantized in the sense that its\nallowable values form a discrete set (for a spin-1/2 particle, \\(\\pm\n\\hslash/2\\)). Energy too may be quantized in this sense. Nor is it\nprecisely that the components of spin in the different directions fail\nto commute\u2014and so cannot be simultaneously discussed, measured,\nimagined, or whatever it is that we are advised not to do with\nnoncommuting observables. Rather the problem is that there is no\nordinary (nonquantum) quantity which, like the spin observable, is a\n3-vector and which also is such that its components in all possible\ndirections belong to the same discrete set. The problem, in other\nwords, is that the usual vector relationships among the various\ncomponents of the spin vector are incompatible with the quantization\nconditions on the values of these components.\n\nFor a particle of spin-1 the problem is even more severe. The\ncomponents of spin in different directions aren\u2019t simultaneously\nmeasurable. Thus, the impossible vector relationships for the spin\ncomponents of a quantum particle are not observable. Bell (1966), and,\nindependently, Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker (1967) showed that for a\nspin-1 particle the squares of the spin components in the various\ndirections satisfy, according to quantum theory, a collection of\nrelationships, each individually observable, that taken together are\nimpossible: the relationships are incompatible with the idea that\nmeasurements of these observables merely reveal their preexisting\nvalues rather than creating them, as quantum theory urges us to\nbelieve. Many physicists and philosophers of physics continue to\nregard the\n Kochen-Specker Theorem\n as precluding the possibility of hidden variables.\n\nWe thus might naturally wonder how Bohmian mechanics copes with spin.\nBut we have already answered this question. Bohmian mechanics makes\nsense for particles with spin, i.e., for particles whose wave\nfunctions are spinor-valued. When such particles are suitably directed\ntoward Stern-Gerlach magnets, they emerge moving in more or less a\ndiscrete set of directions\u20142 possible directions for a spin-1/2\nparticle, having 2 spin components, 3 for spin-1 with 3 spin\ncomponents, and so on. This occurs because the Stern-Gerlach magnets\nare so designed and oriented that a wave packet (a localized wave\nfunction with reasonably well defined velocity) directed towards the\nmagnet will, by virtue of the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution, separate\ninto distinct packets\u2014corresponding to the spin components of\nthe wave function and moving in the discrete set of directions. The\nparticle itself, depending upon its initial position, ends up in one\nof the packets moving in one of the directions.\n\nThe probability distribution for the result of such a\n Stern-Gerlach experiment\n can be conveniently expressed in terms of the quantum mechanical spin\noperators\u2014for a spin-1/2 particle given by certain 2 by 2\nmatrices called the Pauli spin matrices\u2014in the manner alluded to\n above.\n From a Bohmian perspective there is no hint of paradox in any of\nthis\u2014unless we assume that the spin operators correspond to\ngenuine properties of the particles.\n\nFor further discussion and more detailed examples of the Bohmian\nperspective on spin see Norsen 2014.\n",
