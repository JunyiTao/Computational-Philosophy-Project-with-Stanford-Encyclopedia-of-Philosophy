Operationalism and Conventionalism\n\nAbove we saw that mathematical theories of measurement are primarily\nconcerned with the mathematical properties of measurement scales and\nthe conditions of their application. A related but distinct strand of\nscholarship concerns the meaning and use of quantity terms. Scientific\ntheories and models are commonly expressed in terms of quantitative\nrelations among parameters, bearing names such as\n\u201clength\u201d, \u201cunemployment rate\u201d and\n\u201cintroversion\u201d. A realist about one of these terms would\nargue that it refers to a set of properties or relations that exist\nindependently of being measured. An operationalist or conventionalist\nwould argue that the way such quantity-terms apply to concrete\nparticulars depends on nontrivial choices made by humans, and\nspecifically on choices that have to do with the way the relevant\nquantity is measured. Note that under this broad construal, realism is\ncompatible with operationalism and conventionalism. That is, it is\nconceivable that choices of measurement method regulate the use of a\nquantity-term and that, given the correct choice, this term\nsucceeds in referring to a mind-independent property or relation.\nNonetheless, many operationalists and conventionalists adopted\nstronger views, according to which there are no facts of the matter as\nto which of several and nontrivially different operations is correct\nfor applying a given quantity-term. These stronger variants are\ninconsistent with realism about measurement. This section will be\ndedicated to operationalism and conventionalism, and the next to\nrealism about measurement.\n\nOperationalism (or \u201coperationism\u201d) about measurement is\nthe view that the meaning of quantity-concepts is determined by the\nset of operations used for their measurement. The strongest expression\nof operationalism appears in the early work of Percy Bridgman (1927),\nwho argued that \n\n\nwe mean by any concept nothing more than a set of operations; the\nconcept is synonymous with the corresponding set of operations. (1927:\n5) \n\n\nLength, for example, would be defined as the result of the operation\nof concatenating rigid rods. According to this extreme version of\noperationalism, different operations measure different quantities.\nLength measured by using rulers and by timing electromagnetic pulses\nshould, strictly speaking, be distinguished into two distinct\nquantity-concepts labeled \u201clength-1\u201d and\n\u201clength-2\u201d respectively. This conclusion led Bridgman to\nclaim that currently accepted quantity concepts have\n\u201cjoints\u201d where different operations overlap in their\ndomain of application. He warned against dogmatic faith in the unity\nof quantity concepts across these \u201cjoints\u201d, urging instead\nthat unity be checked against experiments whenever the application of\na quantity-concept is to be extended into a new domain. Nevertheless,\nBridgman conceded that as long as the results of different operations\nagree within experimental error it is pragmatically justified to label\nthe corresponding quantities with the same name (1927:\n 16).[8]\n\nOperationalism became influential in psychology, where it was\nwell-received by behaviorists like Edwin Boring (1945) and B.F.\nSkinner (1945). Indeed, Skinner maintained that behaviorism is\n\u201cnothing more than a thoroughgoing operational analysis of\ntraditional mentalistic concepts\u201d (1945: 271). Stevens, who was\nBoring\u2019s student, was a key promoter of operationalism in\npsychology, and argued that psychological concepts have empirical\nmeaning only if they stand for definite and concrete operations (1935:\n517; see also Isaac 2017). The idea that concepts are defined by\nmeasurement operations is consistent with Stevens\u2019 liberal views\non measurability, which were discussed above\n (Section 3.3).\n As long as the assignment of numbers to objects is performed in\naccordance with concrete and consistent rules, Stevens maintained that\nsuch assignment has empirical meaning and does not need to satisfy any\nadditional constraints. Nonetheless, Stevens probably did not embrace\nan anti-realist view about psychological attributes. Instead, there\nare good reasons to think that he understood operationalism as a\nmethodological attitude that was valuable to the extent that it\nallowed psychologists to justify the conclusions they drew from\nexperiments (Feest 2005). For example, Stevens did not treat\noperational definitions as a priori but as amenable to\nimprovement in light of empirical discoveries, implying that he took\npsychological attributes to exist independently of such definitions\n(Stevens 1935: 527). This suggests that Stevens\u2019 operationalism\nwas of a more moderate variety than that found in the early writings\nof\n Bridgman.[9]\n\nOperationalism met with initial enthusiasm by logical positivists, who\nviewed it as akin to verificationism. Nonetheless, it was soon\nrevealed that any attempt to base a theory of meaning on\noperationalist principles was riddled with problems. Among such\nproblems were the automatic reliability operationalism conferred on\nmeasurement operations, the ambiguities surrounding the notion of\noperation, the overly restrictive operational criterion of\nmeaningfulness, and the fact that many useful theoretical concepts\nlack clear operational definitions (Chang\n 2009).[10]\n In particular, Carl Hempel (1956, 1966) criticized operationalists\nfor being unable to define dispositional terms such as\n\u201csolubility in water\u201d, and for multiplying the number of\nscientific concepts in a manner that runs against the need for\nsystematic and simple theories. Accordingly, most writers on the\nsemantics of quantity-terms have avoided espousing an operational\n analysis.[11]\n\nA more widely advocated approach admitted a conventional element to\nthe use of quantity-terms, while resisting attempts to reduce the\nmeaning of quantity terms to measurement operations. These accounts\nare classified under the general heading\n\u201cconventionalism\u201d, though they differ in the particular\naspects of measurement they deem conventional and in the degree of\narbitrariness they ascribe to such\n conventions.[12]\n An early precursor of conventionalism was Ernst Mach, who examined\nthe notion of equality among temperature intervals (1896: 52). Mach\nnoted that different types of thermometric fluid expand at different\n(and nonlinearly related) rates when heated, raising the question:\nwhich fluid expands most uniformly with temperature? According to\nMach, there is no fact of the matter as to which fluid expands more\nuniformly, since the very notion of equality among temperature\nintervals has no determinate application prior to a conventional\nchoice of standard thermometric fluid. Mach coined the term\n\u201cprinciple of coordination\u201d for this sort of\nconventionally chosen principle for the application of a quantity\nconcept. The concepts of uniformity of time and space received similar\ntreatments by Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1898, 1902: Part 2).\nPoincar\u00e9 argued that procedures used to determine equality\namong durations stem from scientists\u2019 unconscious preference for\ndescriptive simplicity, rather than from any fact about nature.\nSimilarly, scientists\u2019 choice to represent space with either\nEuclidean or non-Euclidean geometries is not determined by experience\nbut by considerations of convenience.\n\nConventionalism with respect to measurement reached its most\nsophisticated expression in logical positivism. Logical positivists\nlike Hans Reichenbach and Rudolf Carnap proposed \u201ccoordinative\ndefinitions\u201d or \u201ccorrespondence rules\u201d as the\nsemantic link between theoretical and observational terms. These a\npriori, definition-like statements were intended to regulate the\nuse of theoretical terms by connecting them with empirical procedures\n(Reichenbach 1927: 14\u201319; Carnap 1966: Ch. 24). An example of a\ncoordinative definition is the statement: \u201ca measuring rod\nretains its length when transported\u201d. According to Reichenbach,\nthis statement cannot be empirically verified, because a universal and\nexperimentally undetectable force could exist that equally distorts\nevery object\u2019s length when it is transported. In accordance with\nverificationism, statements that are unverifiable are neither true nor\nfalse. Instead, Reichenbach took this statement to expresses an\narbitrary rule for regulating the use of the concept of equality of\nlength, namely, for determining whether particular instances of length\nare equal (Reichenbach 1927: 16). At the same time, coordinative\ndefinitions were not seen as replacements, but rather as necessary\nadditions, to the familiar sort of theoretical definitions of concepts\nin terms of other concepts (1927: 14). Under the conventionalist\nviewpoint, then, the specification of measurement operations did not\nexhaust the meaning of concepts such as length or length-equality,\nthereby avoiding many of the problems associated with\n operationalism.[13]\n",
