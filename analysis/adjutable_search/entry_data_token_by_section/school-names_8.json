    "main_text": "Gongsun Long\n6. Gongsun Long\n\nGongsun Long (c. 320\u2013250 B.C.E.) was a retainer to the Lord of\nPingyuan (d. 252 B.C.E.) in the northern state of Zhao. Anecdotes\nabout him are found in the Zhuangzi and The Annals of\nL\u00fc Buwei, in which he is depicted advising King Hui of Zhao\n(r. 298\u2013266 B.C.E.) against war (18.1, 18.7) and in disputation\nwith Kong Chuan, a descendent of Confucius, at the home of the Lord of\nPingyuan (18.5). He is mentioned in \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d as a\nleading disputer and in the Han dynasty Records of the Grand\nHistorian (Book 74) as undertaking disputation about the hard and\nwhite and the same and different. Intriguingly, the Annals\ndepicts him citing the Mohist principle of \u201call-inclusive\ncare\u201d (jian ai) to King Hui. Together with his anti-war\nstance, this suggests that he was influenced by and may once have\nnumbered among the Mohists. The Xunzi does not criticize him\nby name but does cite a version of his white horse sophism in a list\nof incorrect uses of names (22.3). \n\nIn one anecdote, Gongsun Long is shown applying his cleverness to help\nrescue a state from attack. Zhao, his state, had formed a treaty with\nQin to assist each other in anything either wished to do. Qin\nproceeded to attack Wei, Zhao\u2019s neighbor. Zhao wished to rescue\nWei, but Qin sent an envoy to the king of Zhao to complain. \n\nThe King of Qin was displeased and sent an envoy to reproach the King\nof Zhao, saying, \u201cThe treaty says, \u2018Whatever Qin wishes to\ndo, Zhao will assist it; whatever Zhao wishes to do, Qin will assist\nit.\u2019 Now Qin wishes to attack Wei, yet Zhao wishes to rescue it.\nThis is not what we agreed on.\u201d The King of Zhao told the Lord\nof Pingyuan about it. The Lord of Pingyuan told Gongsun Long about it.\nGongsun Long said, \u201cWe too can dispatch an envoy to reproach the\nKing of Qin, saying, \u2018Zhao wishes to rescue Wei, but now the\nKing of Qin alone does not assist Zhao. This is not what we agreed\non.\u2019\u201d (The Annals of L\u00fc Buwei, 18.5/457)\n\n\nAnother anecdote is valuable for what it suggests about the nature of\nGongsun Long\u2019s disputations. Gongsun Long debates with an\nopponent, Kong Chuan, at the residence of the Lord of Pingyuan. With\ngreat cleverness, he argues for the claim that \u201cJohn Doe has\nthree ears.\u201d (In Chinese, plurals are unmarked, so the sophist\ncan assert of any normal two-eared person, such as John Doe, that he\n\u201chas ear(s),\u201d and also that he has a left ear and a right\near. Therefore he has \u201cthree ears.\u201d) Eventually, Kong\nChuan is unable to reply. \n\nThe next day, Kong Chuan came to court. The Lord of Pingyuan said to\nhim, \u201cYesterday, Gongsun Long\u2019s speech was extremely\nclever.\u201d Kong Chuan said, \u201cThat\u2019s so. He was nearly\nable to make John Doe have three ears. Although he could do so,\nit\u2019s a difficult claim to accept. May I ask a question of you,\nyour Lordship? Claiming that John Doe has three ears is extremely\ndifficult and in reality is wrong. Claiming that John Doe has two ears\nis extremely easy and in reality is right. I wonder whether your\nLordship will follow what is easy and right, or what is difficult and\nwrong?\u201d (Annals, 18.5/457)\n\n\nGongsun Long\u2019s disputation is perceived as plainly not fitting\n\u201creality\u201d (shi, also the \u201cstuff\u201d\nspoken of). It is an exercise in cleverness, a kind of trick\nperformance in which the disputer attempts to make a case for a claim\nthat everyone knows does not fit its object. Harbsmeier has rightly\nemphasized this point in arguing that further attention to Gongsun\nLong\u2019s social and historical context is needed if we are to\nunderstand the white horse sophism properly (1998: 300\u2013301). He\nsuggests that Gongsun Long probably belonged to a class of\nentertainers at Chinese courts who performed various skills or tricks.\nHis was to prove, over any and all objections, that a white horse is\nnot a horse. His sophistries may have been intended primarily as a\nkind of light entertainment, not as expressions of a principled\nphilosophical position. They touch on philosophical issues, such as\ndiscriminating the same and different, but there is no reason to\nexpect them to demonstrate cogent reasoning based on a coherent\nsemantic or logical theory. The truth may be just the opposite: They\ncould have been intended to be whimsical and amusing, even comical.\nThe \u201cWhite Horse\u201d dialogue may be a record of the sort of\narguments Gongsun Long would offer in his performances. \n\nThe Han History lists Gongsun Long as the author of fourteen\nscrolls of writings. The extant text called Gongsun Longzi\ncomprises only five short dialogues and an introduction, which is\nobviously of relatively late date. A. C. Graham argued persuasively\nthat three of the dialogues are not Warring States texts, but much\nlater forgeries pieced together partly from misunderstood bits of the\nMohist Dialectics. Probably only the \u201cWhite\nHorse,\u201d the essay \u201cIndicating Things,\u201d and a bit of\nanother dialogue are genuine pre-Han\n texts.[17]\n We will look at the first of these below (the second is treated in a\nsupplement at the end of this section). \n\nThe Gongsun Longzi has inspired a vast exegetical literature\nin both Asian and European languages, with no consensus in sight as to\nthe significance and theoretical basis of its arguments. The\ninterpretation proposed here must be considered only one of several\npotentially defensible approaches (others are noted below). In the\ncase of the \u201cWhite Horse\u201d dialogue, the text is generally\nclear enough. (\u201cIndicating Things,\u201d on the other hand,\nappears to be intentionally obscure.) The scholarly controversy\nconcerns what theory and implicit premises to ascribe to the text so\nthat the arguments come out as cogent defenses of a reasonable\nposition. As Graham says, the interpretive obstacle is \u201cthe\ndifficulty of finding an angle of approach from which the arguments\nwill make sense.\u2026The arguments are clear, yet the first seems\nan obvious non sequitur\u2026and the rest seem to assume an\nelementary confusion of identity and class membership\u201d (1989:\n82). Introducing his own interpretation, he says, \u201cNo one has\nyet proposed a reading of the dialogue as a consecutive demonstration\nwhich does not turn it into an improbable medley of gross fallacies\nand logical subtleties\u201d (1990: 193). Building on\nHarbsmeier\u2019s insight that the historical context of Gongsun\nLong\u2019s disputations has been insufficiently appreciated, we may\nsuspect Graham\u2019s remarks signal interpretive charity gone too\nfar. Given what information we have about Gongsun\nLong\u2014Harbsmeier\u2019s considerations, the general reputation\nof the disputers for flippant wordplay, the denunciation of Gongsun\nLong in the \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d essay, and most important, the\nfact that his contemporaries took his most famous claim to be patently\nfalse\u2014we should expect the text to be a \u201cmedley\nof gross fallacies and logical subtleties,\u201d roughly a Chinese\nanalogue to the subtle, fallacious, and deeply amusing arguments of\nLewis Carroll. \n\nNone of this means that interpreting \u201cWhite Horse\u201d is\npointless. We can learn about the serious practice of disputation by\nstudying what is in effect a spoof of disputation, just as an\nanthropologist can learn about a culture by studying its humor. But we\nshould not expect the Gongsun Longzi to present rigorous\narguments or defend well-developed theses of philosophical substance.\nIn this case, interpretive charity may direct us to look not for true\nclaims supported by sound reasoning, but for whimsical claims defended\nby bewildering, even madcap arguments. \n",
