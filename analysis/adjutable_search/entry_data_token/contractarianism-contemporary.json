The Role of the Social Contract\n1.1 Distinctiveness of the Social Contract Approach \n\nThe aim of a social contract theory is to show that members of some\nsociety have reason to endorse and comply with the fundamental social\nrules, laws, institutions, and/or principles of that society. Put\nsimply, it is concerned with public justification, i.e., \u201cof\ndetermining whether or not a given regime is legitimate and therefore\nworthy of loyalty\u201d (D\u2019Agostino 1996, 23). The ultimate\ngoal of state-focused social contract theories is to show that some\npolitical system can meet the challenge Alexander Hamilton raised in\nFederalist no. 1 of whether \u201cmen are really capable or\nnot of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or\nwhether they are forever destined to depend for their political\nconstitutions on accident and force\u201d (Hamilton 1788). Going\nfurther, David Gauthier argues that any system of moral constraints\nmust be justified to those to whom it is meant to apply. \u201cWhat\ntheory of morals,\u201d Gauthier asks, \u201ccan ever serve any\nuseful purpose unless it can show that all the duties it recommends\nare truly endorsed in each individual\u2019s reason?\u201d (1986,\n1).\n\nThe ultimate goal, then, of social contract theories is to show, in\nthe most general sense, that social (moral, political, legal, etc.)\nrules can be rationally justified. This alone does not, however,\ndistinguish the social contract from other approaches in moral and\npolitical philosophy, all of which attempt to show that moral and\npolitical rules are rationally justifiable in some sense. The true\ndistinctiveness of the social contract approach is that justification\ndoes not rely, for its foundation, on some exogenous reason or truth.\nJustification is generated endogenously by rational agreement (or lack\nof rejection in T. M. Scanlon\u2019s version). That is, the fact that\neveryone in a society, given their individual reasoning, would agree\nto a certain rule or principle is the critical justification for that\nrule or principle.\n\nAlthough contract theorists differ in their account of the reasons of\nindividuals, with some being attracted to more objectivist accounts\n(Scanlon 2013), most follow Hobbes in modeling individual reasons as\nsubjective, motivationally internal, or at least agent-relative. This\nmay be because of skepticism about moral reasons generally (Harman\n1975, Gauthier 1986, Binmore 1998), a conviction about the\noverwhelming importance of self-interest to the social order (Hobbes\n1651, Buchanan 2000 [1975], Brennan and Buchanan 1985), a concern to\ntake seriously the disagreement of individual view in modern society\n(Gaus 2011a, 2016; Muldoon 2017; Moehler 2014, 2015, 2018) or because\nthis approach is consistent with the most well-developed theories of\nrational choice in the social sciences (Binmore 2005, Buchanan 2000\n[1975]). In any case, the reasons individuals have for agreeing to\nsome rules or principles are importantly their own reasons, not\n\u201cgood reasons\u201d from the impartial perspective. Of course,\nthose same individuals may care about what they perceive to be the\nimpartial good or some other non-individualistic notion\u2014they\nneed not be egoists\u2014but what they care about, and so their\nreasons will differ from one another. This point, as Rawls highlights\nin his later work, is crucial to understanding political justification\nin a diverse society where members of a society cannot reasonably be\nexpected to have similar conceptions of the good (Rawls 1996). Recent\ncontractarian accounts put even greater weight on heterogeneity\n(Southwood 2010, Gaus 2016, Muldoon 2017, Moehler 2018, Sugden\n2018).\n1.2 The Social Contract as a Model\n\nThe social contract is a model of rational justification that\ntransforms the problem of justification (what reasons individuals\nhave) into a problem of deliberation (what rules they will agree to).\nAs Rawls argues:\n\n[T]he question of justification is settled by working out a problem of\ndeliberation: we have to ascertain which principles it would be\nrational to adopt given the contractual situation. This connects the\ntheory of justice with the theory of rational choice (Rawls 1999, 16).\n\n\nJustification is not a \u201cmere proof\u201d (Rawls 1999a 508), nor\nis it reasoning from given or generally accepted premises to\nconclusions about political legitimacy or morality (Rawls 1980, p.\n518). Rather, the contractual model makes explicit the reasoning that\nconnects our standpoint as persons with determinate interests and\ngoals to our standpoint as citizens.\n\nAt the simplest level, models take something complex and make it\nsimpler. Along these lines, both the economist Ariel Rubinstein (2012)\nand the philosopher Nancy Cartwright (1991) compare models to fables.\nFables are stories that communicate some important lesson in a simple,\neasy-to-understand fashion. Fables, like models, communicate important\ngeneral rules through particular, though fictional, cases.\n\nModels involve abstraction and idealization, but they do more than\nthat: they help us see what our key assumptions are, identify the\nfactors that we see as relevant (Gaus 2016, xv-xvii). Models, as\ntechniques of idealization, do more than abstract (Weisberg 2007a,\n2013). Consider the periodic table of the elements. It is an\nabstraction, but not a model according to Michael Weisberg. He calls\nabstractions like the periodic table abstract direct\nrepresentations to distinguish them from models (2007b). Modeling\nseeks to isolate the important features of the target phenomena,\nallowing the modeler to understand and manipulate important elements\nof the phenomena in simulations. John Rawls\u2019s representatives to\nthe original position, for instance, are not only abstractions of real\npersons. They are idealizations that isolate particular aspects of\npersons that are relevant to justification as a choice, specifically\ntheir thin theory of rationality, and their values (in the form of\nprimary goods). Isolating these features is important for modeling the\nagreement procedure in Rawls\u2019s theory.\n\nGiven this, we can think of social contract theories as having a\ngeneral schematic form. Social contract theories are models of\njustification with several general parameters that are set differently\nin different theories. What distinguishes contractarian theories is\nhow they specify these general parameters (Thrasher 2019). The goal of\nthe model is to represent our reasons for endorsing and complying with\nsome set of social rules, principles, or norms. This is done by\nshowing that our representatives in the model would agree to a given\nset of these rules, principles, or norms in a suitably constructed\nchoice situation. What \u201csuitably constructed\u201d means here\nwill depend on the other parameters in the model.\n\nCritically, there are two sets of relevant individuals (N and\nN*). The first set is the representative choosers\n(N) constructed in the \u201cdevice of representation\u201d\nsuch as the original position (Rawls 1996, 27). The second set\n(N*) is composed of real individuals whose terms of\ninteraction are to be guided by the contract/agreement. If the\ndeliberations of the contractors (N) are to be relevant to\nthe actual participants (N*), the reasoning of the former\nmust, in some way, be shared by the latter. There is, however,\nconsiderable debate about what it means for reasons to be shared in\nthis sense (see\n Public Reason\n and\n Public Justification).\n The other main parameter in the model is the deliberative setting\n(M), in which the model choosers (N) endorse some\nrules, principles, or norms (R).\n\nGiven all of this, we can identify a general model of social contract\ntheories:\n\nGeneral Model of the Social Contract: N\nchooses R in M and this gives N* reason to\nendorse and comply with R in the real world insofar as the\nreasons N has for choosing R in M can be\nshared by N*.\n\nEach of these parameters (N,M,R,N*) can be specified in any\nnumber of ways. The shape of a particular contractual theory depends\non the precise way these parameters are set in the theory.\n2. Modeling the Parties\n2.1 Reductionist vs. Non-Reductionist\n\nHow contract theorists model the representative choosers (N)\nis determined by our (actual) justificatory problem and what\nis relevant to solving it. A major divide among contemporary social\ncontract theories thus involves defining the justificatory problem. A\ndistinction is often drawn between the Hobbesian/Lockean\n (\u201ccontractarian\u201d)\n and Rousseavian/Kantian\n (\u201ccontractualist\u201d)\n interpretations of the justificatory problem. These categories are\nimprecise, and there is often as much difference within these two\napproaches as between them, yet, nevertheless, the distinction can be\nuseful for isolating some key disputes in contemporary social contract\ntheory.\n\nAmong those \u201ccontractarians\u201d who\u2014very\nroughly\u2014can be called followers of Hobbes and/or Locke, the\ncrucial justificatory task is, as Gauthier (1991, 16) puts it, to\nresolve the \u201cfoundational crisis\u201d of morality:\n\nFrom the standpoint of the agent, moral considerations present\nthemselves as constraining his choices and action, in ways independent\nof his desires, aims, and interests\u2026. And so we ask, what\nreason can a person have for recognizing and accepting a constraint\nthat is independent of his desires and interests? \u2026 [W]hat\njustifies paying attention to morality, rather than dismissing it as\nan appendage of outworn beliefs?\n\n\nIf our justificatory problem is not simply to understand what morality\nrequires, but whether morality ought to be paid attention to, or\ninstead dismissed as a superstition based on outmoded metaphysical\ntheories, then obviously the parties to the agreement must not employ\nmoral judgments in their reasoning. Another version of this concern is\nGregory Kavka\u2019s (1984) description of the project to reconcile\nmorality with prudence. On both these accounts, the aim of the\ncontract is to show that commitment to morality is an effective way to\nfurther one\u2019s non-moral aims and interests, answering the\nquestion \u201cwhy be moral?\u201d The political version of this\nproject, is similar, though the target of justification is a set of\npolitical rules or constitution rather than morality generally\n(Buchanan 2000[1975], Coleman 1985, Kavka 1986, Sugden 2018). This\n\u201ccontractarian\u201d project is reductionist in a pretty\nstraightforward sense: it derives moral or political reasons from\nnon-moral ones. Or, to use Rawls\u2019s terminology, it attempts to\ngenerate the reasonable out of the rational (1996, 53).\n\nThe reductionist approach is appealing for several reasons. First,\ninsofar as we doubt the normative basis of moral reasons, such a\nreductionist strategy promises to ground morality\u2014or at least a\nvery basic version of it\u2014on the prosaic normativity of the basic\nrequirements of instrumentalist practical rationality (Moehler 2018).\nThe justificatory question \u201cwhy be moral?\u201d is transformed\ninto the less troubling question \u201cwhy be rational?\u201d\nSecond, even if we recognize that moral reasons are, in some sense,\ngenuine, contractarians like Kavka also want to show that prudent\nindividuals, not independently motivated by morality would have reason\nto reflectively endorse morality. Furthermore, if we have reason to\nsuspect that some segment of the population is, in fact, knavish then\nwe have good defensive reasons based on stability to build our social\ninstitutions and morality so as to restrain those who are only\nmotivated by prudence, even if we suspect that most persons are not so\nmotivated. Geoffrey Brennan and James Buchanan argue that a version of\nGresham\u2019s law holds in political and social institutions that\n\u201cbad behavior drives out good and that all persons will be led\nthemselves by even the presence of a few self-seekers to adopt\nself-interested behavior\u201d (2008 [1985], 68). We need not think\npeople are mostly self-seeking to think that social institutions and\nmorality should be justified to and restrain those who are.\n\nOn the other hand, \u201ccontractualists,\u201d such as Rawls, John\nHarsanyi (1977), Thomas Scanlon (1998), Stephen Darwall (2006),\nNicholas Southwood (2010) and Gerald Gaus (2011) attribute ethical or\npolitical values to the deliberative parties, as well as a much more\nsubstantive, non-instrumentalist form of practical reasoning. The\nkinds of surrogates that model the justificatory problem are already\nso situated that their deliberations will be framed by\nethico-political considerations. The agents\u2019 deliberations are\nnot, as with the Hobbesian theorists, carried out in purely prudential\nor instrumentalist terms, but they are subject to the \u2018veil of\nignorance\u2019 or other substantive conditions. Here the core\njustificatory problem is not whether the very idea of moral and\npolitical constraints makes sense, but what sorts of moral or\npolitical principles meet certain basic moral demands, such as\ntreating all as free and equal moral persons, or not subjecting any\nperson to the will or judgment of another (Reiman 1990, chap. 1). This\napproach, then, is non-reductionist in the sense that justification is\nnot derived from the non-moral.\n\nA benefit of the non-reductive approach is that the choosers in the\ncontractual procedure (N) share many of the normative\nconcerns of their actual counterparts (N*). This should\nensure a closer normative link between the two parties and allow for\nthe contract to generate a thicker, more substantive morality,\npresumably closer to that already held by N*. Whether this is\nso, however, depends on how closely the non-reductionist model of\nrationality is to the reasoning of actual individuals.\n\nAt this point, the debate seems to be centered on two positions, which\nwe might call the robustness and sensitivity\npositions. According to the proponents of robustness, whatever else\nmoral agents may disagree about, we can safely assume that they would\nall be committed to basic standards of rationality (Moehler 2013,\n2017, 2018). We should thus suppose this same basic, shared conception\nof rationality and agency: when people fall short of more moralistic\nideals and virtue, the contract will still function. It will be\nrobust. According to this view, we are better off following Hume\n(1741) in assuming every person to be a knave, even though that maxim\nis false in fact.\n\nThe sensitivity position rejects this, holding that, if, in fact,\nindividuals in N* are not resolutely self-interested, the\nproblems of N, resolutely self-interested individuals, and\ntheir contractual solutions, will be inappropriate to N*.\nPerhaps whereas N* can count on social trust, the\nself-interested contractors will find it elusive and arrive at\nsecond-best alternatives that trusting folks would find silly and\ninefficient. Indeed, the sensitivity theorist may insist that even if\nthe self-interested agents can talk themselves into acting as moral\nagents they do so for the wrong sort of reasons (Gaus 2011,\n185ff).\n2.2 Idealization and Identification \n\nThe core idea of social contract theories, we have been stressing, is\nthat the deliberation of the parties is supposed to model the\njustificatory problem of ordinary moral agents and citizens. Now this\npulls social contract theories in two opposing directions. On the one\nhand, if the deliberations of the hypothetical parties are to model\nour problem and their conclusions are to be of relevance to\nus, the parties must be similar to us. The closer the parties are to\n\u201cyou and me\u201d the better their deliberations will model you\nand me, and be of relevance to us. On the other hand, the point of\ncontract theories is to make headway on our justificatory problem by\nconstructing parties that are models of you and me, suggesting that\nsome idealization is necessary and salutary in constructing a model of\njustification. To recognize that some forms of idealization are\nproblematic does not imply that we should embrace what Gaus has called\n\u201cjustificatory populism\u201d that every person in society must\nactually assent to the social and moral institutions in question (Gaus\n1996, 130\u2013131). Such a standard would take us back to the older\nsocial contract tradition based on direct consent and as we argue in\n\u00a73, modern contract theories are concerned with appeals to our\nreason, not our self-binding power of consent.\n\nDespite possible problems, there are two important motivations behind\nidealization in the modeling of the deliberative parties. First, you\nand I, as we now are, may be confused about what considerations are\nrelevant to our justificatory problem. We have biases and false\nbeliefs; to make progress on solving our problem of justification we\nwish, as far as possible, to see what the result would be if we only\nreasoned correctly from sound and relevant premises. So in\nconstructing the hypothetical parties we wish to idealize them in this\nway. Ideal deliberation theorists like J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1985) and\nSouthwood (2010), in their different ways, are deeply concerned with\nthis reason for idealization. On the face of it, such idealization\ndoes not seem especially troublesome, since our ultimate concern is\nwith what is justified, and so we want the deliberations of the\nparties to track good reasons. But if we idealize too far from\nindividuals and citizens as they presently are (e.g., suppose we posit\nthat they are fully rational in the sense that they know all the\nimplications of all their beliefs and have perfect information) their\ndeliberations may not help much in solving our justificatory problems.\nWe will not be able to identify with their solutions (Suikkanen 2014,\nSouthwood 2019). For example, suppose that hyper-rational and\nperfectly informed parties would have no religious beliefs, so they\nwould not be concerned with freedom of religion or the role of\nreligion of political decision making. But our problem is that among\ntolerably reasonable but far from perfectly rational citizens,\npluralism of religious belief is inescapable. Consequently, to gain\ninsight into the justificatory problem among citizens of limited\nrationality, the parties must model our imperfect rationality.\n2.3 Homogeneity vs. Heterogeneity \n\nSocial contract theories model representative choosers (N) so\nas to render the choice situation determinate. This goal of\ndeterminacy, however, can have the effect of eliminating the pluralism\nof the parties that was the original impetus for contracting in the\nfirst place. In his Lectures on the History of Political\nPhilosophy Rawls tells us that \u201ca normalization of\ninterests attributed to the parties\u201d is \u201ccommon to social\ncontract doctrines\u201d and it is necessary to unify the\nperspectives of the different parties so as to construct a\n\u201cshared point of view\u201d (2007, 226). Here Rawls seems to be\nsuggesting that to achieve determinacy in the contract procedure it is\nnecessary to \u201cnormalize\u201d the perspectives of the\nparties.\n\nThe problem is this. Suppose that the parties to the contract closely\nmodel real agents, and so they have diverse bases for their\ndeliberations\u2014religious, secular, perfectionist, and so on. In\nthis case, it is hard to see how the contract theorist can get a\ndeterminate result. Just as you and I disagree, so will the parties.\nRawls (1999, 121) acknowledges that his restrictions on particular\ninformation in the original position are necessary to achieve a\ndeterminate result. If we exclude \u201cknowledge of those\ncontingencies which set men at odds \u2026. \u201d then since\n\u201ceveryone is equally rational and similarly situated, each is\nconvinced by the same arguments\u201d(Rawls 1999, 17, 120). Gaus\n(2011a, 36\u201347) has argued that a determinative result can only\nbe generated by an implausibly high degree of abstraction, in which\nthe basic pluralism of evaluative standards\u2014the core of our\njustificatory problem\u2014is abstracted away. Thus, on Gaus\u2019s\nview, modelings of the parties that make them anything approaching\nrepresentations of real people will only be able to generate a\nnon-singleton set of eligible social contracts. The parties might\nagree that some social contracts are better than none, but they will\ndisagree on their ordering of possible social contracts. This\nconclusion, refined and developed in (Gaus 2011a, Part Two) connects\nthe traditional problem of indeterminacy in the contract procedure\n(see also Hardin 2003) with the contemporary, technical problem of\nequilibrium selection in games (see Vanderschraaf 2005). A topic we\nwill explore more in \u00a73 below.\n\nIt is possible, however, that determinacy may actually require\ndiversity in the perspective of the deliberative parties in a way that\nRawls and others like Harsanyi didn\u2019t expect. The reason for\nthis is simple, though the proof is somewhat complex. Normalizing the\nperspectives of the parties assumes that there is one stable point of\nview that has all of the relevant information necessary for generating\na stable and determinate set of social rules. There is no reason,\nantecedently, to think that such a perspective can be found, however.\nInstead, if we recognize that there are epistemic gains to be had from\na \u201cdivision of cognitive labor\u201d there is good reason to\nprefer a diverse rather than normalized idealization of the parties to\nthe contract (see: Weisberg and Muldoon 2009, Gaus 2016, Muldoon 2017,\nMuldoon 2017a, Muldoon 2018). There is reason to conclude that if we\nwish to discover social contracts that best achieve a set of\ninterrelated normative desiderata (e.g., liberty, equality, welfare,\netc.), a deliberative process that draws on a diversity of\nperspectives will outperform one based on a strict normalization of\nperspectives (Gaus 2011b, 2016; Thrasher 2020).\n2.4 Doxastic vs. Evaluative \n\nAny representation of the reasoning of the parties will have two\nelements that need to be specified: 1) doxastic and 2) evaluative.\nThese elements, when combined, create a complete model that will\nspecify how and why representatives in the contractual model choose or\nagree to some set of social rules. The first (doxastic) is the\nspecification of everything the representatives in the original\nposition know or at least believe. Choice in the contractual model in\nthe broadest sense, is an attempt by the parties to choose a set of\nrules that they expect will be better than in some baseline condition,\nsuch as \u201cgeneralized egoism\u201d (Rawls, 1999: 127) a\n\u201cstate of nature\u201d (Hobbes 1651) or the rules that they\ncurrently have (Binmore, 2005; Buchanan 2000 [1975]). To do this, they\nneed representations of the baseline and of state of the world under\ncandidate set of rules). Without either of these doxastic\nrepresentations, the choice problem would be indeterminate. Rawls\nfamously imposes severe doxastic constraints on his parties to the\nsocial contract by imposing a thick veil of ignorance that eliminates\ninformation about the specific details of each individual and the\nworld they live in. James Buchanan imposes a similar, but less\nrestrictive \u201cveil of uncertainty\u201d on his representative\nchoosers (Buchanan and Tullock 1965 [1962]; Buchanan 1975; see also\nRawls, 1958).\n\nIn addition to specifying what the representatives believe to be the\ncase about the world and the results of their agreement, there must\nalso be some standard by which the representative parties can evaluate\ndifferent contractual possibilities. They must be able to rank the\noptions on the basis of their values, whatever those may be. Rawls\nmodels parties to the contractual situation as, at least initially,\nhaving only one metric of value: primary goods. They choose the\nconception of justice they do insofar as they believe it will likely\ngenerate the most primary goods for them and their descendants. This\nspecification of the evaluative parameter is uniform across choosers\nand therefore, choice in the original position can be modeled as the\nchoice of one individual. Insofar as there is evaluative diversity\nbetween the representatives, more complex models of agreement will be\nneeded (see \u00a73). If we think in terms of decision theory, the\ndoxastic specification individuates the initial state of affairs and\nthe outcomes of the contractual model, while the specification of the\nevaluative elements gives each representative party a ranking of the\noutcomes expected to result from the choice of any given set of rules.\nOnce these elements are specified, we have a model of the parties to\nthe contract.\n3. Modeling Agreement\n\nSocial contract theories fundamentally differ in whether the parties\nreason differently or the same. As we have seen (\u00a72.3) in\nRawls\u2019s Original Position, everyone reasons the same: the\ncollective choice problem is reduced to the choice of one individual.\nAny one person\u2019s decision is a proxy for everyone else. In\nsocial contracts of this sort, the description of the parties (their\nmotivation, the conditions under which they choose) does all the work:\nonce we have fully specified the reasoning of one party, the contract\nhas been identified.\n\nThe alternative view is that, even after we have specified the parties\n(including their rationality, values and information), they continue\nto disagree in their rankings of possible social contracts. On this\nview, the contract only has a determinate result if there is some way\nto commensurate the different rankings of each individual to yield an\nagreement (D\u2019Agostino 2003). We can distinguish four basic\nagreement mechanisms of doing this.\n3.1 Consent \n\nThe traditional social contract views of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau\ncrucially relied on the idea of consent. For Locke only \u201cconsent\nof Free-men\u201d could make them members of the government (Locke\n1689, \u00a7117). In the hands of these theorists\u2014and in much\nordinary discourse\u2014the idea of \u201cconsent\u201d implies a\nnormative power to bind oneself. When one reaches \u201cthe age of\nconsent\u201d one is empowered to make certain sorts of binding\nagreements\u2014contracts. By putting consent at the center of their\ncontracts these early modern contract theorists (1) were clearly\nsupposing that individuals had basic normative powers over themselves\n(e.g. self-ownership) before they entered into the social contract (a\npoint that Hume (1748) stressed), and (2) brought the question of\npolitical obligation to the fore. If the parties have the power to\nbind themselves by exercising this normative power, then the upshot of\nthe social contract was obligation. As Hobbes (1651, 81 [chap\nxiv,\u00b67) insisted, covenants bind; that is why they are\n\u201cartificial chains\u201d (1651, 138 [chap. xxi, \u00b65).\n\nBoth of these considerations have come under attack in contemporary\nsocial contract theories, especially the second. According to\nBuchanan, the key development of recent social contract theory has\nbeen to distinguish the question of what generates political\nobligation (the key concern of the consent tradition in\nsocial contract thought) from the question of what constitutional\norders or social institutions are mutually beneficial and stable over\ntime (1965). The nature of a person\u2019s duty to abide by\nthe law or social rules is a matter of morality as it pertains to\nindividuals (Rawls 1999, 293ff), while the design and justification of\npolitical and social institutions is a question of public or social\nmorality. Thus, in Buchanan\u2019s view, a crucial feature of more\nrecent contractual thought has been to refocus political philosophy on\npublic or social morality rather than individual obligation. In most\nmodern social contract theories, including Rawls\u2019s, consent and\nobligation play almost no role whatsoever.\n\nAlthough contemporary social contract theorists still sometimes employ\nthe language of consent, the core idea of contemporary social contract\ntheory is agreement. \u201cSocial contract views work from\nthe intuitive idea of agreement\u201d (Freeman 2007a, 17). One can\nendorse or agree to a principle without that act of endorsement in any\nway binding one to obey. Social contract theorists as diverse as\nSamuel Freeman and Jan Narveson (1988, 148) see the act of agreement\nas indicating what reasons we have; agreement is a \u201ctest\u201d\nor a heuristic (see \u00a75). The \u201crole of unanimous collective\nagreement\u201d is in showing \u201cwhat we have reasons to do in\nour social and political relations\u201d (Freeman 2007, 19). Thus\nunderstood, the agreement is not itself a binding act\u2014it is not\na performative that somehow creates obligation\u2014but is\nreason-revealing (Lessnoff 1986). If individuals are rational, what\nthey agree to reflects the reasons they have. In contemporary contract\ntheories such as Rawls\u2019s, the problem of justification takes\ncenter stage. Rawls\u2019s revival of social contract theory in A\nTheory of Justice thus did not base obligations on consent,\nthough the apparatus of an \u201coriginal agreement\u201d persisted.\nRecall that for Rawls (1999, 16) the aim is to settle \u201cthe\nquestion of justification \u2026 by working out a problem of\ndeliberation.\u201d\n\nGiven that the problem of justification has taken center stage, the\nsecond aspect of contemporary social contract thinking appears to fall\ninto place: its reliance on models of counterfactual agreement. The\naim is to model the reasons of citizens, and so we ask what they would\nagree to under conditions in which their agreements would be expected\nto track their reasons. Contemporary contract theory is,\ncharacteristically, doubly counterfactual. Certainly, no\nprominent theorist thinks that questions of justification are settled\nby an actual survey of attitudes towards existing social arrangements,\nand are not settled until such a survey has been carried out. The\nquestion, then, is not \u201cAre these arrangements\npresently the object of an actual agreement among citizens?\u201d (If\nthis were the question, the answer would typically be\n\u201cNo\u201d.) The question, rather, is \u201cWould\nthese arrangements be the object of an agreement if citizens were\nsurveyed?\u201d Although both of the questions are, in some sense,\nsusceptible to an empirical reading, only the latter is in play in\npresent-day theorizing. The contract nowadays is always counterfactual\nin at least this first sense.\n\nThere is a reading of the (first-order) counterfactual question,\n\u201cWould R be the object of agreement if___\u201d which,\nas indicated, is still resolutely empirical in some sense. This is the\nreading where what is required of the theorist is that she try to\ndetermine what an actual survey of actual citizens would reveal about\ntheir actual attitudes towards their system of social arrangements.\n(This is seldom done, of course; the theorist does it in her\nimagination. See, though, Klosko 2000). But there is another\ninterpretation that is more widely accepted in the contemporary\ncontext. On this reading, the question is no longer a counterfactual\nquestion about actual reactions; it is, rather, a\ncounterfactual question about counterfactual\nreactions\u2014it is, as we have said, doubly\ncounterfactual. Framing the question is the first\ncounterfactual element: \u201cWould R be the object of\nagreement if they were surveyed?\u201d Framed by this\nquestion is the second counterfactual element, one which involves the\ncitizens, who are no longer treated empirically, i.e. taken as given,\nbut are, instead, themselves considered from a counterfactual point of\nview\u2014as they would be if (typically) they were better informed\nor more impartial, etc. The question for most contemporary contract\ntheorists, then, is, roughly: \u201cIf we surveyed the idealized\nsurrogates of the actual citizens in this polity, what social\narrangements would be the object of an agreement among\nthem?\u201d\n\nFamously, Ronald Dworkin (1975) has objected that a (doubly)\nhypothetical agreement cannot bind any actual person. For the\nhypothetical analysis to make sense, it must be shown that\nhypothetical persons in the contract can agree to endorse and comply\nwith some principle regulating social arrangements. Suppose that it\ncould be shown that your surrogate (a better informed, more impartial\nversion of you) would agree to a principle. What has that to do with\nyou? Where this second-stage hypothetical analysis is employed, it\nseems to be proposed that you can be bound by agreements that\nothers, different from you, would have made. While it might\n(though it needn\u2019t) be reasonable to suppose that you\ncan be bound by agreements that you would yourself have entered into\nif, given the opportunity, it seems crazy to think that you can be\nbound by agreements that, demonstrably, you wouldn\u2019t have made\neven if you had been asked.\n\nThis criticism is decisive, however, only if the hypothetical social\ncontract is supposed to invoke your normative power to self-bind via\nconsent. That your surrogate employs her power to self-bind would not\nmean that you had employed your power. Again, though, the power to\nobligate oneself is not typically invoked in the contemporary social\ncontract: the problem of deliberation is supposed to help us make\nheadway on the problem of justification. So the question for\ncontemporary hypothetical contract theories is whether the\nhypothetical agreement of your surrogate tracks your reasons to accept\nsocial arrangements, a very different issue (Stark 2000).\n\nThis argument has been revived by Jussi Suikkanen (2014) as the claim\nthat certain forms of contract theory, most notably Southwood\u2019s\n(2010) \u201cdeliberative\u201d contractualism, commit the\nconditional fallacy. The conditional fallacy is a specific version of\nthe problem we are considering here, namely that a conditional with\ncounterfactual agents, will not necessarily apply if the\ncounterfactual agents are sufficiently different from the real ones it\nis meant to apply to. In response, Southwood (2019) develops what he\ncalls an \u201cadvice model\u201d of contractualism wherein we take\nthe counterfactual contractors to generate reasons that should appeal\nto us as advice from a more thoughtful, idealized version of\nourselves, along lines similar to Michael Smith\u2019s (1994) ideal\nadvisor theory of moral reasons. Thrasher (2019) raises a different\nbut related concern that segmented choice in the model of agreement\ncan create outcomes that are not rationalizable to the parties, since\nthey are the result of path-dependent processes.\n\nAs we have argued, contemporary social contract theory rely on\nhypothetical or counterfactual agreement, rather than actual\nagreement. In one sense this is certainly the case. However, in many\nways the \u201chypothetical/actual\u201d divide is artificial: the\ncounterfactual agreement is meant to model, and provide the basis for,\nactual agreement. All models are counterfactual Understanding\ncontemporary social contract theory is best achieved, not through\ninsisting on the distinction between actual and hypothetical\ncontracts, but by grasping the interplay of the counterfactual and the\nactual in the model of agreement.\n\nRawls (1995) is especially clear on this point in his explication of\nhis model of agreement in response to Habermas. There he distinguishes\nbetween three different perspectives relevant to the assessment of the\nmodel (1996, 28):\n\nyou and me\nthe parties to the deliberative model\npersons in a well-ordered society\n\n\nThe agreement of the parties in the deliberative model is certainly\ncounterfactual in the two-fold sense we have analyzed: a\ncounterfactual agreement among counterfactual parties. But the point\nof the deliberative model is to help us (i.e., \u201cyou and\nme\u201d) solve our justificatory problem\u2014what social\narrangements we can all accept as \u201cfree persons who have no\nauthority over one another\u201d (Rawls 1958, 33). The parties\u2019\ndeliberations and the conditions under which they deliberate, then,\nmodel our actual convictions about justice and justification. As Rawls\nsays (1999, 514), the reasoning of the counterfactual parties matters\nto us because \u201cthe conditions embodied in the description of\nthis situation are ones that we do in fact accept.\u201d Unless the\ncounterfactual models the actual, the upshot of the agreement could\nnot provide us with reasons. Gaus describes this process as a\n\u201ctesting conception\u201d of the social contract (2011a, 425).\nWe use the counterfactual deliberative device of the contract to\n\u201ctest\u201d our social institutions. In this way, the\ncontemporary social contract is meant to be a model of the\njustificatory situation that all individuals face. The counterfactual\nand abstracted (see \u00a72) nature of the contract is needed to\nhighlight the relevant features of the parties to show what reasons\nthey have.\n\nSamuel Freeman has recently stressed the way in which focusing on the\nthird perspective\u2014of citizens in a well-ordered\nsociety\u2014also shows the importance of counterfactual agreement in\nRawls\u2019s contract theory. On Freeman\u2019s interpretation, the\nsocial contract must meet the condition of publicity. He\n(2007b:15) writes:\n\nRawls distinguishes three levels of publicity: first, the publicity of\nprinciples of justice; second, the publicity of the general beliefs in\nlight of which first principles of justice can be accepted\n(\u201cthat is, the theory of human nature and of social institutions\ngenerally)\u201d; and, third, the publicity of the complete\njustification of the public conception of justice as it would be on\nits own terms. All three levels, Rawls contends, are exemplified in a\nwell-ordered society. This is the \u201cfull publicity\u201d\ncondition.\n\n\nA justified contract must meet the full publicity condition: its\ncomplete justification must be capable of being actually accepted by\nmembers of a well-ordered society. The counterfactual agreement itself\nprovides only what Rawls (1996, 386) calls a \u201cpro\ntanto\u201d or \u201cso far as it goes\u201d justification of\nthe principles of justice. \u201cFull justification\u201d is\nachieved only when actual \u201cpeople endorse and will liberal\njustice for the particular (and often conflicting) reasons implicit in\nthe reasonable comprehensive doctrines they hold\u201d (Freeman\n2007b, 19). Thus understood, Rawls\u2019s concern with the stability\nof justice as fairness, which motivated the move to political\nliberalism, is itself a question of justification (Weithman, 2010).\nOnly if the principles of justice are stable in this way are they\nfully justified. Rawls\u2019s concern with stability and publicity is\nnot, however, idiosyncratic and is shared by all contemporary contract\ntheorists. It is significant that even theorists such as Buchanan\n(2000 [1975], 26\u201327), Gauthier (1986, 348), and Binmore (2005,\n5\u20137)\u2014who are so different from Rawls in other\nrespects\u2014share his concern with stability.\n3.2 Bargaining\n\nIt is perhaps no surprise that the renaissance in contemporary contact\ntheory occurred at the same time as game-theoretic tools and\nespecially bargaining theory began to be applied to philosophical\nproblems. Bargaining theory, as it was developed by John Nash (1950)\nand John Harsanyi (1977) is a rigorous approach to modeling how\nrational individuals would agree to divide some good or surplus. In\nits most general form, the bargaining model of agreement specifies\nsome set of individuals who have individual utility functions that can\nbe represented in relation to one other without requiring\ninterpersonal comparisons of utility directly. Some surplus is\nspecified and if the individuals involved can agree on how to divide\nthe good in question, they will get that division. If, however, they\ncannot agree they will instead get their disagreement result. This may\nbe what they brought to the table or it could be some other specified\namount. One example is a simple demand game where two people must\nwrite down how much of given pot of money they want. If the two\n\u201cbids\u201d amount to equal or less than the pot, each will get\nwhat he or she wrote down, otherwise each will get nothing.\n\nAs Rawls recognized in his 1958 essay \u201cJustice as\nFairness\u201d one way for parties to resolve their disagreements is\nto employ bargaining solutions, such as that proposed by R.B.\nBraithwaite (1955). Rawls himself rejected bargaining solutions to the\nsocial contract since, in his opinion, such solutions rely on\n\u201cthreat advantage\u201d (i.e., disagreement result) and\n\u201cto each according to his threat advantage is hardly a principle\nof fairness\u201d (Rawls 1958, 58n). In addition to Rawls\u2019s\nconcern about threat advantage, a drawback of all such approaches is\nthe multiplicity of bargaining solutions, which can significantly\ndiffer. Although the Nash solution is most favored today, it can have\ncounter-intuitive implications. Furthermore, there are many who argue\nthat bargaining solutions are inherently indeterminate and so the only\nway to achieve determinacy is to introduce unrealistic or\ncontroversial assumptions (Sugden, 1990, 1991; Thrasher 2014). Similar\nproblems also exist for equilibrium selection in games (see\nVanderschraaf 2005 and Harsanyi and Selten 1988).\n\nGauthier famously pursued the bargaining approach, building his Morals\nby Agreement on his bargaining solution, minimax relative concession,\nwhich is equivalent to the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution in\nthe two-person case (see also Gaus 1990, Ch. IX). Binmore (2005) has\nrecently advanced a version of social contract theory that relies on\nthe Nash bargaining solution, as does Ryan Muldoon (2017) while\nMoehler (2018) relies on a \u201cstabilized\u201d Nash bargaining\nsolution. In later work, Gauthier (1993) shifted from minimax relative\nconcession to the Nash solution. Gauthier has since adopted a less\nformal approach to bargaining that is, nevertheless, closer to his\noriginal solution than to the Nash Solution (2013).\n\nMany of the recent developments in bargaining theory and the social\ncontract have adopted dynamic (Muldoon 2017, Vanderschraaf 2018) or\neven evolutionary approaches to modeling bargaining (Alexander and\nSkyrms 1999, Skyrms 2014). This highlights a general divide in\nbargaining models between what we can call axiomatic and\nprocess models. The traditional, axiomatic, approach to the\nbargaining problem going back to John Nash, codified by John Harsanyi,\nand popularized by R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa (1957). Out of\nthis tradition has come several core bargaining solutions. Each uses a\nslightly different set of axioms to generate a unique and generally\napplicable way to divide a surplus. These include, most notably, the\negalitarian (Raiffa 1953), the Nash (1950), the stabilized Nash\n(Moehler 2010), the Kalai-Smorodinsky (1975), and Gauthier\u2019s\nminimax relative concession (1986). The main point of contention among\nthese theories is whether to employ Nash\u2019s independence axiom or\nto use a monotonicity axiom (as the egalitarian, Kalai-Smorodinsky,\nand minimax relative concession do), although, to one degree or\nanother all of the axioms have been contested.\n\nThe other approach is what we can call a process model.\nInstead of using various axioms to generate a uniquely rational\nsolution, these theorists rely on some procedure that will generate a\ndeterminate, though not always unique result. Process approaches use\nsome mechanism to generate agreement. An example is an auction. There\nare many types of auctions (e.g., English, Dutch, Vickrey, etc.), each\nhas a way of generating bids on some good and then deciding on a\nprice. Posted price selling, like one often sees in consumer markets,\nare also a kind of bargain, though an extremely asymmetric one where\nthe seller has offered a \u201ctake or leave it\u201d ask.\nDouble-auctions are more symmetrical and have a clearer link to the\ninitial bargaining model. Although auctions are not typically used to\nsolve pure division problems, there are some examples of auction\nmechanisms being used to solve public goods problems in interesting\nways that guarantee unanimity (Smith 1977). Dworkin also uses a kind\nof auction mechanism in his work on equality, though he doesn\u2019t\ndevelop his approach for more general application (Dworkin 1981, Heath\n2004). Despite its promise, however, auction theory and its potential\napplication to social contract theory have largely gone\nunexploited.\n\nThe main process approach to bargaining derives from the influential\nwork of Rubinstein (1982) and his proof that it is possible to show\nthat an alternating offer bargaining process will generate the same\nresult as Nash\u2019s axiomatic solution in certain cases. This\nresult added life to Nash\u2019s (1950) early observation that\nbargaining and the rules of bargaining must be the result of some\nnon-cooperative game, with the idea being that it might be possible to\nunify bargaining theory and game theory. This approach, called the\nNash Program, is most notably championed by Binmore (1998), whose\nevolutionary approach to the social contract relies on biological\nevolution (the game of life) to generate the background conditions of\nbargaining (the game of morals). Both can be modeled as\nnon-cooperative games and the later can be modeled as a bargaining\nproblem. By using this approach, Binmore (1998, 2005) claims to be\nable to show, in a robust and non-question-begging way, that something\nvery much like Rawls\u2019s \u201cjustice as fairness\u201d will be\nthe result of this evolutionary bargaining process.\n\nA more empirically minded approach follows Schelling\u2019s (1960)\nearly work on bargaining and game theory by looking at the way actual\npeople bargain and reach agreement. The pioneers of experimental\neconomics used laboratory experiments to look at how subjects behaved\nin division problems (Hoffman et. al. 2000, Smith 2003). Some of the\nmost interesting results came, perhaps surprisingly, from asymmetric\nbargaining games like the ultimatum game (Smith 1982). Since these\nearly experiments, considerable experimental work has been done on\nbargaining problems and cooperative agreement in economics. Much of\nthe most philosophically relevant work involves the importance of\nsocial norms and conventions in determining the result (Bicchieri\n2016, Vanderschraaf 2018).\n\nAlthough appealing to a bargaining solution can give determinacy to a\nsocial contract, it does so at the cost of appealing to a\ncontroversial commensuration mechanism in the case of axiomatic\nbargaining or of moving to process approaches that must ultimately\nrely on the empirically contingent outcome of social and biological\nevolution. Although the importance of bargaining in the social\ncontract has been moribund for some time, recent work is changing that\n(see Alexander 2007, Thrasher 2014, Thoma 2015, Muldoon 2017, Moehler\n2018, Vanderschraaf 2018, Bruner 2020).\n3.3 Aggregation\n\nWe can distinguish bargaining from aggregation models of agreement.\nRather than seeking an outcome that (as, roughly, the\nKalai-Smorodinsky solution does) splits the difference between various\nclaims, we might seek to aggregate the individual rankings into an\noverall social choice. Arrow\u2019s theorem and related problems with\nsocial choice rules casts doubt on any claim that one specific way of\naggregating is uniquely rational: all have their shortcomings (Gaus\nand Thrasher 2021, chap. 8). Harsanyi (1977, chaps. 1 and 2; 1982)\ndevelops a contractual theory much like Rawls\u2019s using this\napproach. In Harsanyi\u2019s approach, reasoning behind a veil of\nignorance in which people do not know their post-contract identities,\nhe supposes that rational contractors will assume it is equally\nprobable that they will be any specific person. Moreover, he argues\nthat contractors can agree on interpersonal utility comparisons, and\nso they will opt for a contract that aggregates utility at the highest\naverage (see also Mueller 2003, chap. 26). This, of course, depends on\nthe supposition that there is a non-controversial metric that allows\nus to aggregate the parties\u2019 utility functions. Binmore (2005)\nfollows Harsanyi and Amartya Sen (2009, Chap. 13) in arguing that\ninterpersonal comparisons can be made for the purposes of aggregation,\nat least some of the time. John Broome (1995) develops something like\nHarsanyi\u2019s approach that relies on making interpersonal\ncomparisons.\n\nOne of the problems with this approach, however, is that if the\ninterpersonal comparisons are incomplete they will not be able to\nproduce a complete social ordering. As Sen points out, this will lead\nto a maximal set of alternatives where no alternative is dominated by\nany other within the set but also where no particular alternative is\noptimal (Sen, 1997). Instead of solving the aggregation problem, then,\ninterpersonal comparisons may only be able to reduce the set of\nalternatives without being able to complete the ordering of\nalternatives.\n\nBecause of the problems with indeterminacy, many theorists have\nrejected the aggregation approach as being either unworkable or as\nbeing incomplete in some way. Gaus (2011), for instance, uses an\nevolutionary mechanism to generate determinacy in his aggregation\nmodel. Brian Kogelmann (2017) argues, however, that under reasonable\nassumptions about the preferences of the representative agents,\naggregation alone is sufficient to generate determinacy.\n3.4 Equilibrium\n\nThere is a long tradition of thinking of the social contract as a kind\nof equilibrium. Within this tradition, however, the tendency is to see\nthe social contract as some kind of equilibrium solution to a\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma type situation (see Gauthier, 1986 and\nBuchanan, 2000 [1975]). Brian Skyrms (1996, 2004) suggests a different\napproach. Suppose that we have a contractual negotiation in which\nthere are two parties, ordering four possible \u201csocial\ncontracts\u201d:\n\nboth Alf and Betty hunt stag\nboth hunt hare;\nAlf hunts stag, Betty hunts hare;\nAlf hunts hare, Betty hunts stag.\n\n\nLet 3 be the best outcome, and let 1 be the worst in each\nperson\u2019s ranking (Alf\u2019s ranking is first in each pair). We\nthus get Figure 1\n\n\n\n\n \nALF \n\n \nHunt Stag\nHunt Hare \n\nBETTY\nHunt Stag\n3,3\n2,1 \n\nHunt Hare\n1,2\n2,2  \n\n\nFigure 1: A Stag Hunt\n\n\nThe Stag Hunt, Skyrms argues, \u201cshould be a focal point for\nsocial contract theory\u201d (2004, 4). The issue in the Stag Hunt is\nnot whether we fight or not, but whether we cooperate and gain, or\neach go our separate ways. There are two Nash equilibria in this game:\nboth hunting stag and both hunting hare. Alf and Betty, should they\nfind themselves at one of these equilibria, will stick to it if each\nconsults only his or her own ranking of options. In a Nash\nequilibrium, no individual has a reason to defect. Of course, the\ncontract in which they both hunt stag is a better contract: it is\nPareto superior to that in which they both hunt hare. The Hare\nequilibrium is, however, risk superior in that it is a safer bet.\nSkyrms argues that the theory of iterated games can show not simply\nthat our parties will arrive at a social contract, but how they can\ncome to arrive at the cooperative, mutually beneficial contract. If we\nhave a chance to play repeated games, Skyrms holds, we can learn from\nHume about the \u201cshadow of the future\u201d: \u201cI learn to\ndo a service to another, without bearing him any real kindness;\nbecause I foresee, that he will return my service, in expectation of\nanother of the same kind, and in order to maintain the same\ncorrespondence of good offices with me and with others\u201d (Skyrms\n2004, 5). Sugden, along different lines, also suggests that repeated\ninteractions, what he calls \u201cexperience\u201d is essential to\nthe determination of which norms of social interaction actually hold\nover time (1986).\n\nThe problem with equilibrium solutions is that, as in the stag hunt\ngame, many games have multiple equilibria. The problem then becomes\nhow to select one unique equilibrium from a set of possible ones. The\nproblem is compounded by the controversies over equilibrium refinement\nconcepts (see Harsanyi and Selten 1988). Many refinements have been\nsuggested but, as in bargaining theory, all are controversial to one\ndegree or another. One of the interesting developments in social\ncontract theory spurred by game theorists such as Skyrms and Binmore\nis the appeal to evolutionary game theory as a way to solve the\ncommensuration and equilibrium selection problem (Vanderschraaf 2005).\nWhat cannot be solved by appeal to reason (because there simply is no\ndeterminate solution) may be solved by repeated interactions among\nrational parties. The work of theorists such as Skyrms and Binmore\nalso blurs the line between justification and explanation. Their\nanalyses shed light both on the justificatory problem\u2014what are\nthe characteristics of a cooperative social order that people freely\nfollow?\u2014while also explaining how such orders may come\nabout.\n\nThe use of evolutionary game theory and evolutionary techniques is a\nburgeoning and exciting area of contract theory. One of the many\nquestions that arise, however, is that of why, and if so under what\ncircumstances, we should endorse the output of evolutionary\nprocedures. Should one equilibrium be preferred to another merely\nbecause it was the output of an evolutionary procedure? Surely we\nwould want reasons independent of history for reflectively endorsing\nsome equilibrium. This problem highlights the concern that social\ncontracts that are the product of evolutionary procedures will not\nmeet the publicity condition in the right kind of way. If the\npublicity condition seems harder to meet, the evolutionary approach\nprovides a powerful and dynamic way to understand stability. Following\nMaynard Smith (1982), we can see stability as being an evolutionarily\nstable strategy equilibrium or an ESS. Basically, this is the idea\nthat an equilibrium in an evolutionary game where successful\nstrategies replicate at higher rates is stable if the equilibrium\ncomposition of the population in terms of strategies is not\nsusceptible to invasion by a mutant strategy. An ESS is an application\nof the Nash equilibrium concept to populations. A population is\nevolutionarily stable when a mutant strategy is not a better response\nto the population than the current mix of strategies in the\npopulation. This gives a formal interpretation of Rawls\u2019s\nconception of \u201cinherent stability\u201d and to Buchanan\u2019s\nnotion that social contracts should be able to withstand subversion by\na sub-population of knaves. This new conception of stability combined\nwith the dynamic nature of evolutionary games provides interesting new\nways for the social contract theorist to model the output of the\ncontract.\n4. The Object of Agreement\n\nSocial contract theories differ about the object of the contract. In\nthe traditional contract theories of Hobbes and Locke, the contract\nwas about the terms of political association. In particular, the\nproblem was the grounds and limits of citizen\u2019s obligation to\nobey the state. In his early formulation, Rawls\u2019s parties\ndeliberated about \u201ccommon practices\u201d (1958). In his later\nstatement of his view, Rawls took the object of agreement to be\nprinciples of justice to regulate \u201cthe basic\nstructure:\u201d\n\nThe basic structure is understood as the way in which the major social\ninstitutions fit together into one system, and how they assign\nfundamental rights and duties and shape the division of advantages\nthat arises through social cooperation. Thus the political\nconstitution, the legally enforced forms of property, and the\norganization of the economy, and the nature of the family, all belong\nto the basic structure. (Rawls 1996, 258)\n\n\nFor Rawls, as for most contemporary contract theorists, the object of\nagreement is not, at least directly, the grounds of political\nobligation, but the principles of justice that regulate the basic\ninstitutions of society. Freeman (2007a: 23), focuses on \u201cthe\nsocial role of norms in public life.\u201d Buchanan is concerned with\njustifying constitutional orders of social and political institutions\n(2000 [1975]). Gauthier (1986), Scanlon (1998), Darwall (2006),\nSouthwood (2010), and Gaus (2011a) employ the contract device to\njustify social moral norms or rules.\n\nThe level at which the object of the contract is described is apt to\naffect the outcome of the agreement. \u201cA striking feature of\nHobbes\u2019 view,\u201d Russell Hardin points out, \u201cis that\nit is a relative assessment of whole states of affairs. Life under one\nform of government versus life under anarchy\u201d (2003, 43). Hobbes\ncould plausibly argue that everyone would agree to the social contract\nbecause \u201clife under government\u201d is, from the perspective\nof everyone, better than \u201clife under anarchy\u201d (the\nbaseline condition). However, if a Hobbesian sought to divide the\ncontract up into, say, more fine-grained agreements about the various\nfunctions of government, she is apt to find that agreement would not\nbe forthcoming on many functions. As we \u201czoom in\u201d (Lister,\n2010) on more fine-grained functions of government, the contract is\napt to become more limited. If the parties are simply considering\nwhether government is better than anarchy, they will opt for just\nabout any government (including, say, one that funds the arts); if\nthey are considering whether to have a government that funds the arts\nor one that doesn\u2019t, it is easy to see how they may not agree on\nthe former. In a similar way, if the parties are deliberating about\nentire moral codes, there may be wide agreement that all the moral\ncodes, overall, are in everyone\u2019s interests; if we \u201czoom\nin\u201d in specific rights and duties, we are apt to get a very\ndifferent answer.\n\nIn multi-level contract theories such as we find in the work of\nBuchanan\u2019s (2000 [1975], Moehler\u2019s (2018), or Thrasher\n(2020), each stage or level has its own unique object. In\nBuchanan\u2019s theory, the object of the constitutional stage is a\nsystem of constraints that will allow individuals to peacefully\nco-exist, what Buchanan calls the \u201cprotective state\u201d (2000\n[1975]). On his view, the state of nature is characterized by both\npredation and defense. One\u2019s ability to engage in productive\nenterprises is decreased because of the need to defend the fruits of\nthose enterprises against those who would rely on predation rather\nthan production. We all have reason to contract, according to\nBuchanan, in order to increase the overall ability of everyone to\nproduce by limiting the need for defense by constraining the ability\nto engage in predation. Once the solution to the predation-production\nconflict has been solved by the constitutional contract, members of\nsociety also realize that if all contributed to the production of\nvarious public goods, the productive possibility of society would be\nsimilarly increased. This second, post-constitutional stage, involves\nwhat Buchanan calls the \u201cproductive state.\u201d Each stage is\nlogically distinct though there are causal relationships between\nchanges made at one stage and the efficacy and stability of the\nsolution at the later stage. The distinction between the two stages is\nanalogous to the traditional distinction between commutative and\ndistributive justice. Although these two are often bound up together\nin contemporary contract theory, one of Buchanan\u2019s novel\ncontributions is to suggest that there are theoretical gains to\nseparating these distinct objects of agreement.\n\nMoehler\u2019s (2017) \u201cmulti-level\u201d contract has several\naspects. First, drawing on their pluralistic moral commitments\nindividuals seek to agree on social-moral rules that all can endorse\nas a common morality. This object of this agreement is similar to that\nof Darwall\u2019s, Gaus\u2019s and Southwood\u2019s models. The\nsecond-level agreement is appropriate to circumstances in which\npluralism is so deep and wide no common morality can be forged. Rather\nthan moral agents, the parties are reconceived as instrumentally\nrational prudential agents: the object of this second level is rules\nof cooperation that advance the interests of all when a deeper moral\nbasis cannot be uncovered.\n5. What Does the Contract Show?\n\nSuppose, then, that we have arrived at some social contract. Depending\non the initial justificatory problem, it will yield an outcome\nR (principles, rules, etc. that have some normative property\nL\u2014such as justice, morality, authority, obligation,\nlegitimacy, mutual benefit, and so on. But, supposing that the\ncontract has generated a principle, rule, etc. with the relevant\nnormative property, precisely what is shown by the fact that this\nprinciple or rule was generated through the contractual device?\n\nThroughout we have been distinguishing the justificatory problem from\nthe deliberative model. Now the strongest that could be claimed for a\ncontractual argument is that the outcome of the deliberative model is\nconstitutive of both the correct solution of the\njustificatory problem and the conclusion that \u201cR has\nL.\u201d On this \u201cconstructivist\u201d reading of the\noutcome of the deliberative model, there is no independent and\ndeterminate external justification that R has L,\nwhich the contractual device is intended to approximate, but, rather,\nthat R is the outcome of the deliberative model is the\ntruth-maker for \u201cR has L\u201d.\n\nRawls, along with Gauthier and Buchanan, was sometimes attracted to\nsuch a reading. Rawls (1999, 104) describes the argument from the\noriginal position as invoking \u201cpure procedural\njustice\u201d\u2014the deliberative situation is so set up that\nwhatever principles it generates are, by the fact of their\ngeneration, just. But, his considered position is that the outcome of\nthe deliberative model is indicative (not constitutive) of\nthe correct solution to \u201cthe question of justification\u201d\n(1999, 16).\n\nWe might say that the deliberative model is evidence of the\nproper answer to the question of justification. However, this is still\nconsistent with Rawls\u2019s \u201cconstructivism\u201d because the\nanswer to the justificatory problem is constitutive of\nR\u2019s having L. So we might say that\nRawls\u2019s two principles are just\u2014simply because they are in\nreflective equilibrium with the considered judgments of you and me and\nthat they would be chosen in the original position is indicative of\nthis.\n\nThe weakest interpretation of the contract is that the contractual\nresult is simply indicative of the correct answer to the\njustificatory problem, which itself is simply indicative of the fact\nthat R has L. One could be a \u201crealist,\u201d\nmaintaining that whether R has L is a fact that\nholds whether or not the contract device generates R has\nL, and independently of whether the correct answer to our\njustificatory problem (i.e., what we can justify to each other) is\nthat R has L. There is still logical space for a\ntype of contractualism here, but an indicative contractualism of this\nsort would not be a form of \u201cconstructivism.\u201d Some, for\nexample, have argued that Scanlon\u2019s theory is actually based on\na sort of natural rights theory, where these rights are prior to the\ncontract (Mack 2007). Even if this is correct, Scanlon can be a sort\nof social contract theorist. The diversity of possible approaches\nwithin social contract theory indicates the variety of different uses\nto which social contract theory can be applied.\n6. Conclusion: The Social Contract and Justification\n\nThe social contract theories of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau all\nstressed that the justification of the state depends on showing that\neveryone would, in some way, consent to it. By relying on consent,\nsocial contract theory seemed to suppose a voluntarist conception of\npolitical justice and obligation: what counts as \u201cjustice\u201d\nof \u201cobligation\u201d depends on what people agree\nto\u2014whatever that might be. Only in Kant (1797) does it become\nclear that consent is not fundamental to a social contract view: we\nhave a duty to agree to act according to the idea of the\n\u201coriginal contract.\u201d Rawls\u2019s revival of social\ncontract theory in A Theory of Justice did not base\nobligations on consent, though the apparatus of an \u201coriginal\nagreement\u201d persisted as a way to help solve the problem of\njustification. As the question of public justification takes center\nstage, it becomes clear that posing the problem of justification in\nterms of a deliberative or a bargaining problem is a heuristic: the\nreal issue is \u201cthe problem of justification\u201d\u2014what\nprinciples can be justified to all reasonable citizens or persons.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackerman, Bruce, 1980. <em>Social Justice in the Liberal\nState</em>.
