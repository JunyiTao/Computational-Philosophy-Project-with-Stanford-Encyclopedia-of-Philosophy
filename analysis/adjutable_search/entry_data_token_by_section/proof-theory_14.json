    "main_text": "Beyond Arithmetic: Subsystems of Z2 || Impredicative Subsystems and Generalized Inductive Definitions\n5.3 Impredicative Subsystems and Generalized Inductive Definitions \n\nSpector\u2019s (1962) functional interpretation of \\(\\bZ_2\\) via bar\nrecursive functionals was of great interest to proof theory. However,\nit was not clear whether there was a constructive foundation of these\nfunctionals along the lines of hereditarily continuous functionals\nthat can be represented by computable functions (akin to Kleene 1959;\nKreisel 1959) which would make them acceptable on intuitionistic\ngrounds. In 1963 Kreisel conducted a seminar the expressed aim of\nwhich was to assay the constructivity of Spector\u2019s\ninterpretation (see Kreisel 1963). Specifically he asked whether an\nintuitionistic theory of monotonic inductive definitions,\n\\(\\bID^i_1(\\text{mon})\\), could model bar recursion, or even more\nspecifically, formally capture a class of indices of representing\nfunctions of these functionals. In a subsequent report the\nseminar\u2019s conclusion was later summarized by Kreisel:\n\n\n\u2026 the answer is negative by a wide margin, since not even bar\nrecursion of type 2 can be proved consistent [from intuitionistically\naccepted principles]. (Kreisel in \u201cReports of the Seminar on the Foundations of Analysis,\nStanford, Summer 1963\u201d, as quoted in Feferman 1998: 223)\n\n\n\nHe not only introduced theories of one inductive definition but also\nof \\(\\nu\\)-times transfinitely iterated inductive definitions,\n\\(\\bID_{\\nu}\\). Albeit it soon became clear that even the theories\n\\(\\bID_{\\nu}\\) couldn\u2019t reach the strength of \\(\\bZ_2\\) (in\npoint of fact, such theories are much weaker than the fragment of\n\\(\\bZ_2\\) based on \\(\\Pi^1_2\\)-comprehension); they became the subject\nof proof-theoretic investigation in their own right and occupied the\nattention of proof theorists for at least another 15 years. One reason\nfor this interest was surely that the intuitionistic versions\ncorresponding to the accessible (i.e., well-founded) part of a\nprimitive recursive ordering are immediately constructively appealing\nand a further reason was that they were thought to be more amenable to\ndirect proof-theoretic treatments than fragments of \\(\\bZ_2\\) or set\ntheories.\n\nWe shall not give a detailed account of the formalization of these\ntheories, but focus on the non-iterated case \\(\\bID_1\\) and its\nintuitionistic version \\(\\bID_1^i\\) to convey the idea. A monotone\noperator on \\(\\bbN\\) is a map \\(\\Gamma\\) that sends a set \\(X\\subseteq\n\\bbN\\) to a subset \\(\\Gamma(X)\\) of \\(\\bbN\\) and is monotone, i.e.,\n\\(X\\subseteq Y\\subseteq \\bbN\\) implies \\(\\Gamma(X) \\subseteq\n\\Gamma(Y)\\). Owing to monotonicity, the operator \\(\\Gamma\\)\nwill have a least fixed point \\(I_{\\Gamma}\\subseteq\\bbN\\), i.e.,\n\\(\\Gamma( I_{\\Gamma})=I_{\\Gamma}\\) and for every other fixed point\nX it holds \\(I_{\\Gamma} \\subseteq X\\).\nSet-theoretically \\(I_{\\Gamma}\\) is obtained by iterating \\(\\Gamma\\)\nthrough the ordinals,  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\Gamma^0&=\\emptyset,\\\\\n\\Gamma^1&=\\Gamma(\\Gamma^0),\\\\\n\\Gamma^{\\alpha}&=\\Gamma\\left(\\bigcup_{\\xi<\\alpha}\\Gamma^{\\xi}\\right).\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nMonotonicity ensures (in set theory) that one finds an ordinal\n\\(\\tau\\) such that \\(\\Gamma(\\Gamma^{\\tau})=\\Gamma^{\\tau}\\), and the\nset \\(\\Gamma^{\\tau}\\) will be the least fixed point. If one adds a new\n1-place predicate symbol P to the language of arithmetic, one\ncan describe the so-called positive arithmetical operators. They are\nof the form  \n\n\\[\n\\Gamma_A(X)=\\{n\\in\\bbN\\mid A(n,X)\\}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A(x,P)\\) is a formula of the language of PA\naugmented by P in which the predicate P occurs only\n positively.[28]\n The syntactic condition of positivity then ensures that the operator\n\\(\\Gamma_A\\) is monotone. The language of \\(\\bID_1\\) is an extension\nof that of PA. It contains a unary predicate symbol\n\\(I_A\\) for each positive arithmetical operator \\(\\Gamma_A\\) and the\naxioms  \n\n\\[\\label{id1} \n\\begin{align}\n\\tag{Id1} \\forall x\\,(A(x,I_A)\\rightarrow I_A(x))\\\\\n\\tag{Id2}  \\forall x\\,[A(x,F)\\to F(x)]\\to \\forall x\\,[I_A(x)\\to F(x)]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere in (Id2) \\(F(x)\\) is an arbitrary formula of \\(\\bID_1\\) and\n\\(A(x,F)\\) arises from \\(A(x,P)\\) by replacing every occurrence of\n\\(P(t)\\) in the formula by \\(F(t)\\). Collectively these axioms assert\nthat \\(I_A\\) is the least fixed point of \\(\\Gamma_A\\), or more\naccurately the least among all sets of natural numbers definable in\nthe language of \\(\\bID_1\\). \\(\\bID_1^i\\) will be used to denote the\nintuitionistic version. Its subtheory \\(\\bID_{1}^{i}(\\cO)\\) is\nobtained by just adding the predicate symbol \\(I_A\\) and the\npertaining axioms (Id1) and (Id2), where \\(\\Gamma_A\\) is the operator\nthat defines Kleene\u2019s \\(\\cO\\) (cf.\n Definition 5.1).\n\nBy a complicated passage through formal theories for choice sequences\nit was known that the theory \\(\\bID_{1}\\) can be reduced to\n\\(\\bID_{1}^{i}(\\cO)\\). The first ordinal analysis for the theory\n\\(\\bID_{1}^{i}(\\cO)\\) was obtained by Howard (1972). Via the known\nproof-theoretical reductions this entailed also an ordinal analysis\nfor \\(\\bID_{1}\\). The proof-theoretic ordinal of \\(\\bID_{1}\\) is the\nBachmann-Howard ordinal, which is denoted by\n\\({\\psi_{\\sOmega_{1}}(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega_1+1})}\\) in the system of\n Definition 5.11.\n\nAs inductively defined sets can be the starting point of another\ninductive definition, the procedure of inductively defining predicates\ncan be iterated along any well-ordering \\(\\nu\\) in a uniform way. This\nleads to the theories \\(\\bID_{\\nu}\\) which allow one to formalize\n\\(\\nu\\)-times iterated inductive definitions, where \\(\\nu\\) stands for\na primitive recursive well-ordering. If \\(\\nu\\) is a well-ordering on\nconstructive grounds then also the \\(\\nu\\)-times iterated version of\nKleene\u2019s \\(\\cO\\) has a clear constructive meaning. As a result\nthe formal theories \\({{\\bID}}^i_{\\nu}(\\cO)\\) that embody this process\nare constructively justified. The topic of theories of iterated\ninductive definitions was flourishing at the 1968 conference on\nIntuitionism and Proof Theory in Buffalo (see Kino et al. 1970). One\nof the main proof-theoretic goals was to find a reduction of the\nclassical theories \\(\\bID_{\\nu}\\) to their intuitionistic counterparts\n\\({{\\bID}}^i_{\\nu}(\\cO)\\). This was all the more desirable because of\nknown reductions of important fragments of second order arithmetic to\ntheories of the former kind. Friedman (1970) had shown that the second\norder system with the \\(\\Sigma _2^1\\)-axiom of choice can be\ninterpreted in the system\n\\(\\hbox{($\\Pi_1^1$-CA)}_{<{\\varepsilon_0}}\\) of less than\n\\({\\varepsilon_0}\\)-fold iterated \\(\\Pi_1^1\\)-comprehensions and\nFeferman (1970a) had shown that less than \\(\\nu\\)-fold iterated\n\\(\\Pi_1^1\\)-comprehensions could be interpreted in the system \n\n\\[\n\\bID_{<\\nu} \\coloneqq \\bigcup_{\\alpha<\\nu}\\bID_{\\alpha}\n\\]\n\n\nfor \\(\\nu=\\omega^{\\gamma}\\) with \\(\\gamma\\) limit. However, Zucker\n(1973) showed that there are definite obstacles to a straightforward\nreduction of the theories \\(\\text{ID}_{\\nu}\\) for \\(\\nu > 1\\) to\ntheir intuitionistic cousins. Sieg (1977) attacked the problem by a\nmethod adapted from Tait (1970) who had used cut elimination for an\ninfinitary propositional logic with formulae indexed over constructive\nnumber classes to obtain a consistency proof for second order\narithmetic theory with the schema of \\(\\Sigma _2^1\\) dependent\nchoices. He achieved a reduction of \\(\\bID_{<\\nu}\\) to\n\\(\\bID_{<\\nu}^i(\\cO)\\) for limit \\(\\nu\\) by carrying out the proof\ntheory for a system of \\(\\PL_{\\alpha}\\) of propositional logic with\ninfinitely long conjunctions and disjunctions indexed over the\nconstructive number classes \\(\\cO_{\\alpha}\\) for \\(\\alpha<\\nu\\)\ninside \\(\\bID^i_{\\alpha+1}(\\cO)\\). As \\(\\bID_{\\alpha}\\) can be reduced\nto \\(\\PL_{\\alpha}\\) this brought about the reduction. Ordinal analyses\nfor theories of iterated inductive definitions, first for finite and\nthen also for transfinite iterations, were obtained by Pohlers using\nTakeuti\u2019s reduction procedure for \\(\\Pi_1^1\\)-comprehension (see\nPohlers 1975, 1977). Working independently, Buchholz (1977a) used a new type of rules, dubbed\n\\(\\Omega_{\\mu+1}\\)-rules to recapture these results without use of\nTakeuti\u2019s methods. These rules are an extension of the\n\u03a9-rule described in\n Definition C.3.\n5.3.1 Interlude: an ordinal representation system beyond Bachmann\u2019s \n\nThe ordinal representation systems encountered so far are not\nsufficient for expressing the strength of theories of iterated\ninductive definitions nor that of the strongest of the standard system\nof reverse mathematics, \\((\\Pi^1_1{\\Hy}\\bCA)_0\\). Therefore we\nintersperse a brief account of how to proceed onwards, adumbrating the\nmain ideas.\n\nBachmann\u2019s bold move of using large ordinals to generate names\nfor small ordinals was a very important idea. To obtain ordinal\nanalyses of ever stronger theories one has to find new ways of\ndefining ordinal representation systems that can encapsulate their\nstrength. The latter goes hand in hand with the development of new cut\nelimination techniques that are capable of removing cuts in\n(infinitary) proof systems with strong reflection rules. Ordinal\nrepresentations, however, appear to pose a considerable barrier to\nunderstanding books and articles in this research area. Nonetheless we\nthink that they are the best way to express the proof-theoretic\nstrength of a theory as they provide a scale by means of which one can\nget a grasp of how much stronger a theory \\(S_1\\) is than another\ntheory \\(S_2\\) (rather than the bland statement that \\(S_1\\) is\nstronger than \\(S_2\\)).\n\nAs an example we will introduce an ordinal representation system which\ncharacterizes the theory \\((\\Pi^1_1{\\Hy}\\bCA)+{{\\BI}}\\), following\nBuchholz 1977b. It is\nbased on certain ordinal functions \\(\\psi_{\\sOmega_n}\\) which are\noften called collapsing functions. The definition of these\nfunctions, that is of the value \\({\\psi_{\\sOmega_{n}}(\\alpha)}\\) at\n\\(\\alpha\\), proceeds by recursion on \\(\\alpha\\) and gets intertwined\nwith the definition of sets of ordinals\n\\(C^{{\\Omega_{\\omega}}}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\), dubbed \u201cSkolem\nhulls\u201d since they are defined as the smallest structures closed\nunder certain functions specified below.\n\nLet \\(\\bbN^+\\) be the natural numbers without 0. Below we shall assume\nthat \\(\\Omega_n\\) \\((n\\in\\bbN^+)\\) is a \u201clarge\u201d ordinal\nand that \\(\\omega<\\Omega_n <\\Omega_{n+1}\\). Their limit,\n\\(\\sup_{n\\in\\bbN^+}\\Omega_n\\), will be denoted by\n\\(\\Omega_{\\omega}\\).\n\n\nDefinition 5.11 By recursion on \\(\\alpha\\)\nwe define:  \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nC^{\\Omega_{\\omega}}(\\alpha,\\beta) & = \n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} \\textrm{closure of } \\beta\\cup\\{0,\\Omega_{\\omega}\\}\\cup\\{\\Omega_n\\mid n\\in\\bbN^+\\}  \\\\\n\\textrm{under: }\\\\ \n+, (\\xi\\mapsto \\omega^{\\xi})\\\\\n(\\xi\\longmapsto{\\psi_{\\sOmega_{n}}(\\xi)})_{\\xi<\\alpha}\\textrm{ for } n\\in\\bbN^+\n\\end{array}\\right. \\\\[1ex]\n{\\psi_{\\sOmega_{n}}(\\alpha)}&= \\min\\{\\rho<\\Omega_n\\mid\\;C^{\\Omega_{\\omega}}(\\alpha,\\rho)\\cap\\Omega_n=\\rho\\}.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nAt this point it is not clear whether \\({\\psi_{\\sOmega_{n}}(\\alpha)}\\)\nwill actually be defined for all \\(\\alpha\\) since there might not\nexist a \\(\\rho<\\Omega_n\\) such that  \n\n\\[\nC^{{\\Omega_{\\omega}}}(\\alpha,\\rho)\\cap\\Omega_n=\\rho.\n\\]\n\n\nThis is where the \u201clargeness\u201d of \\(\\Omega_n\\) comes into\nplay. One (easy) way of guaranteeing this consists in letting\n\\(\\Omega_n\\) be the \\(n^{th}\\) uncountable regular cardinal, that is\n\\(\\Omega_n\\coloneqq \\aleph_n\\). However, such strong set-theoretic\nassumptions can be avoided. For instance, it suffices to let\n\\(\\Omega_n\\) be the \\(n^{th}\\) recursively regular ordinal (which is a\ncountable ordinal) (see Rathjen 1993a).\n\nTo get a better feel for what \\(\\psi_{\\sOmega_{n}}\\) is doing, note\nthat if \\(\\rho={\\psi_{\\sOmega_{n}}(\\alpha)}\\), then\n\\(\\rho<\\Omega_n\\) and with \\([\\rho,\\Omega_n)\\) being the interval\nconsisting of ordinals \\(\\rho\\leq\\alpha<\\Omega_n\\) one has \n\n\\[\n[\\rho,\\Omega_n)\\cap C^{\\Omega_{\\omega}} (\\alpha,\\rho) =\\emptyset\n\\]\n\n\nthus the order-type of the ordinals below \\(\\Omega_n\\) which belong to\nthe \u201cSkolem hull\u201d \\(C^{{\\Omega_{\\omega}}}(\\alpha,\\rho)\\)\nis \\(\\rho\\). In more pictorial terms, \\(\\rho\\) is said to be the\n\\(\\alpha^{th}\\) collapse of \\(\\Omega_n\\) since the order-type\nof \\(\\Omega_n\\) viewed from within the structure\n\\(C^{{\\Omega_{\\omega}}}(\\alpha,\\rho)\\) is actually \\(\\rho\\).\n\nThe ordinal representation system we are after is provided by the set\n \n\n\\[\nC^{{\\Omega_{\\omega}}}(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega_{\\omega}+1},0)\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega_{\\omega}+1} \\) is the least epsilon number\nafter \\(\\Omega_{\\omega}\\), i.e., the least ordinal\n\\(\\eta>\\Omega_{\\omega}\\) such that \\(\\omega^{\\eta}=\\eta\\). The\nproof-theoretic ordinal of \\((\\Pi^1_1{\\Hy}\\bCA)+{{\\BI}}\\) is\n\\({\\psi_{\\sOmega_{1}}(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega_{\\omega}+1})}\\). Although\nthe definition of the set\n\\(C^{{\\Omega_{\\omega}}}(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega_{\\omega}+1},0)\\) and its\nordering is set-theoretic, it turns that it also has a purely\nprimitive recursive definition which can be given in a fragment of\nPRA. Thus the set-theoretic presentation mainly\nserves the purpose of a \u201cvisualization\u201d of an elementary\nwell-ordering.\n\nThe pattern of definition exhibited in\n Definition 5.11\n continues for stronger systems, albeit only as a basic template since\nfor theories beyond the level of \\((\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCA)+{{\\BI}}\\)\nsubstantially new ideas are required. Analogies between large\nset-theoretic ordinals (cardinals) and recursively large ordinals on\nthe one hand and ordinal representation systems on the other hand can\nbe a fruitful source of inspiration for devising new representation\nsystems. More often than not, hierarchies and structural properties\nthat have been investigated in set theory and recursion theory on\nordinals turn out to have proof-theoretic counterparts.\n5.3.2 Assigning proof-theoretic ordinals \n\nUsing an extended version of the representation system from\n Definition 5.11\n if\n \\(\\nu>\\omega\\),[29]\n the outcome of all the work on the theories of inductive definitions\ncan be summarized by the following\n theorem.[30]\n\n\n\nTheorem 5.12 For recursive \\(\\nu\\), \n\n\\[\n\\lvert \\bID_{\\nu}\\rvert = \\lvert \\bID^i_{\\nu}(\\cO)\\rvert = \\psi_{\\sOmega_\\nu}(\\varepsilon_{\\sOmega_{\\nu}+1}).\n\\]\n\n\n\nA generalized treatment of theories of iterated inductive definitions\nfor arbitrary well-orderings and of autonomous iteration was carried\nout in Rathjen 1988, 2010. These theories are stronger than\n\\((\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCA)\\) if \\(\\nu\\geq\\varepsilon_0\\).\n\nTheorem 5.12\n played an important role in determining the exact strength of some\nfragments of \\(\\bZ_2\\). The major ordinal-theoretic results pertaining\nto subsystems of \\(\\bZ_2\\) of the pre-1980 area given in the next\n theorem.[31]\n\n\nTheorem 5.13\n\n\\(\\lvert (\\Pi^1_1{\\Hy}\\bCA)_0\\rvert =\n\\lvert \\bID_{<\\omega}\\rvert =\\psi_{\\sOmega_1}(\\Omega_{\\omega})\\)\n\\(\\lvert (\\Pi^1_1{\\Hy}\\bCA)\\rvert\n=\\psi_{\\sOmega_1}(\\Omega_{\\omega}\\cdot\\varepsilon_0)\\)\n\\(\\lvert (\\Pi^1_1{\\Hy}\\bCA)+{{\\BI}}\\rvert =\\lvert \\bID_{\\omega}\\rvert\n=\\psi_{\\sOmega_1}(\\varepsilon_{\\sOmega_{\\omega}+1})\\)\n\\(\\lvert (\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCR)\\rvert =\n\\psi_{\\sOmega_1}(\\Omega_{\\omega^{\\omega}})\\)\n\\(\\lvert (\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCA)\\rvert =\n\\psi_{\\sOmega_1}(\\Omega_{\\varepsilon_0})\\)\n\n\n\nThe next challenge after \\((\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCA)\\) was posed by the\ntheory \\((\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCA)+{{\\BI}}\\). Its treatment not only\nrequired a considerably stronger ordinal representation system but\nalso coincided with a shift away from \\(\\cL_2\\) theories and theories\nof iterated inductive definitions to a direct proof-theoretic\ntreatment of set theories. Pioneering work on the proof theory of set\ntheories is mainly due to J\u00e4ger (1980, 1982). The analysis of\n\\((\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCA)+{{\\BI}}\\) in J\u00e4ger & Pohlers 1982\nprovides a particularly nice application of this new approach which\nhas been called admissible proof theory, owing to its concern\nwith theories extending Kripke-Platek set theory by axioms asserting\nthe existence of admissible sets (for some details see\n Appendix D.1).\n\n\nTheorem 5.14 \\(\\lvert (\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCA)+\\BI\\rvert =\n\\psi_{\\sOmega_1}(\\varepsilon_{I+1})\\)\n\n\nThe \u201cI\u201d in the foregoing notation is supposed to be\nindicative of \u201cinaccessible cardinal\u201d. Indeed,\nthe easiest way to build an extended ordinal representation system\nsufficient unto this task (modeled on\n Definition 5.11)\n is to add an inaccessible I, close the Skolem hulls under\n\\(\\xi\\mapsto \\Omega_\\xi\\) for \\(\\xi<I\\) and introduce collapsing\nfunctions \\(\\psi_{\\pi}\\) for all \\(\\pi\\) of either form I or\n\\(\\Omega_{\\xi+1}\\).\n\nThe goal of giving an ordinal analysis of full second order arithmetic\nhas not been attained yet. For many years \\(\\Pi^1_2\\)-comprehension\nposed a formidable challenge and the quest for its ordinal analysis\nattained something of a holy grail status (cf. Feferman 1989). At\nfirst blush it might be difficult to see why the latter comprehension\nis so much more powerful than \\(\\Delta^1_2\\)-comprehension (plus\n\\({{\\BI}}\\)). To get a sense for the enormous difference, it seems\nadvisable to work in (admissible) set theory and consider a hierarchy\nof recursively large ordinal notions wherein these comprehension\nschemes correspond to the bottom and the top end of the scale,\nrespectively. That is discussed in\n Appendix D.\n Here we just mention a few reductions to \u201cconstructive\u201d\nframeworks. The reductions we have in mind, underlie a broadened view\nof \u201cconstructivity\u201d. Constructive theories of functions\nand sets that relate to Bishop\u2019s constructive mathematics as\ntheories like ZFC relate to Cantorian set theory have\nbeen proposed by Myhill, Martin\u2013L\u00f6f, Feferman and Aczel.\nAmong those are Feferman\u2019s constructive theory of operations and\nclasses, \\(\\bT_0\\) in 1975 and 1979, Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s\nintuitionistic type theory (1984) and constructive set theory,\nespecially Constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory,\nCZF, the latter also combined with the regular\nextension axiom, REA. By employing an ordinal\nanalysis for set theory KPi which is an extension of\nKripke-Platek set theory via an axiom asserting that every set is\ncontained in an admissible set (see\n Appendix D)\n it has been shown that KPi and consequently\n\\((\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCA)+{{\\BI}}\\) can be reduced to both of these\ntheories:\n\n\nTheorem 5.15 (Feferman 1975; J\u00e4ger\n1983; J\u00e4ger & Pohlers 1982; Rathjen 1993b)\n\\((\\Delta^1_2{\\Hy}\\bCA)+\\BI\\), KPi, \\(\\bT_0\\) and\nCZF+REA are proof-theoretically\nequivalent. In particular, these theories prove the same theorems in\nthe negative arithmetic fragment.\n\n\n\nTheorem 5.16 (Rathjen 1993b; Setzer 1998)\nThe soundness of the negative arithmetic fragment of\n\\(\\Delta^1_2-\\bCA+\\BI\\) and KPi is provable in\nMartin-L\u00f6f\u2019s 1984 type theory.\n\n\nA detailed account of these results has been given in section 3 of\nRathjen 1999a.\n6. Epilogue \n\nProof theory has become a large subject with many specialized branches\nthat can be mathematically quite complex. So we have tried to present\ndevelopments close to the main artery of its body, starting with its\ninception at the beginning of the twentieth century and ending with\nresults from the close of the century. The theorems mentioned at the\nend of section 5 foreshadow investigations in the twenty-first century\nthat are presented in Rathjen (2018) and concern relationships\nbetween Feferman\u2019s systems of explicit mathematics and\nMartin-L\u00f6f type theories; the paper touches also on the\ncompletely new developments of homotopy type theory (see Awodey 2012).\nSome additional contemporary proof theoretic developments are\ndescribed in appendices\n D,\n E and\n F.\n The theme of\n Appendix E,\n the extraction of computational information from proofs in particular\nformal theories, is the central topic of Schwichtenberg and\nWainer\u2019s 2012. They deal with theories of arithmetic and\nanalysis up to \\((\\Pi^1_1{\\Hy}\\bCA)_0\\). Standard texts on proof\ntheory covering ordinal analysis are Takeuti 1985 and Sch\u00fctte\n1977. First steps into ordinal analysis are taken in Pohlers 2009.\nFinally, some new directions of proof theoretic work are taken in\ncontributions to both Kahle and Rathjen 2015 and J\u00e4ger and\nSieg 2018.\n\nLet us also report on progress on the methodological issues the\nfinitist consistency program was to address. First of all, due to\nquite a bit of important historical work, we have a much better grasp\nof the evolution of the program in the 1920s and its roots in the\ndevelopment toward modern structuralist mathematics in the nineteenth\ncentury. The work of editing Hilbert\u2019s unpublished lecture notes\nhas opened a treasure of\n information.[32]\n The connections to the development in nineteenth century mathematics\nare hinted at in\n Appendix A,\n but they are explored in greater depth, for example, in\nFerreir\u00f3s 2008; Reck 2003, 2013; and the papers Sieg wrote on\nDedekind with Morris (forthcoming) and Schlimm (2005, 2017),\nrespectively. Secondly, as to the properly methodological issues, we\npresented some broad considerations in\n section 4.1,\n namely, that consistency proofs should be given relative to\n\u201cconstructive\u201d theories. We did not make any remarks about\nwhat is characteristic of a constructive perspective and why such a\nperspective has not only a mathematical, but also a philosophical\npoint. There is, of course, a very rich literature. Let us point to\nsome informative sources: van Atten (2007) as defending\nBrouwer\u2019s views, Martin-L\u00f6f (1984) as exposing the\nphilosophical motivation for his type theory, Feferman (1988, 2000)\ndiscussing the foundational point of proof theory, Bernays (1976) as\npresenting crucial aspects of an informed philosophy of mathematics,\nand (Sieg 2013) as\nexplicating (the context for) his reductive\nstructuralism.\n\nBack to proof theory: We have to admit that we neglected some\nclassical topics. One is the study of different proof systems and\ntheir relationships going back to Gentzen\u2019s dissertation (1935).\nIn their Basic Proof Theory, Troelstra and Schwichtenberg\n(2000) give an excellent selection, but some important calculi such as\nthe Sch\u00fctte proof systems are not covered (see, for example,\nSch\u00fctte 1960b, 1977). They also do not cover proof systems for\ntemporal and modal logic, neither are substructural logics\n presented.[33]\n\n\nA second omission concerns Bounded Arithmetic, where feasibility\nissues are a central focus: one studies formal theories with provably\nrecursive functions that form very small subclasses of the primitive\nrecursive ones. Indeed, the class of the provably total functions of\nBuss\u2019 base theory is that of functions that can be computed in\npolynomial time, and there was the hope that proof theoretic\ninvestigations might contribute novel results in complexity theory. A\nthird omission concerns proof mining; that line of deep mathematical\ninvestigations using proof theoretic tools was initiated by Kreisel\n(1958, 1982) and Luckhardt (1989), but really perfected only by Kohlenbach\n(2007). We hinted at the work of his school at the very end of\n section 4.1.\n\nProof theory, as we described it, deals primarily with formal proofs\nor derivations. Hilbert aimed, however, as we pointed out in\n section 1,\n for a more general analysis of ordinary, informal mathematical\nproofs. For Gentzen in his 1936, \u201cthe objects of proof theory\nshall be the proofs carried out in mathematics proper\u201d (p. 499). The aim of Hilbert and his\ncollaborators was undoubtedly to achieve a deeper mathematical and\nconceptual understanding, but also to find general methods of proof\nconstruction in formal calculi. This is now being pursued in the very\nactive area of using powerful computers for the interactive\nverification of proofs and programs as well as the fully automated\nsearch for proofs of mathematical\n theorems.[34]\n That can be pursued with a cognitive scientific purpose of modeling\nmathematical reasoning (see Sieg 2010 and Ganesalingam & Gowers 2017). It is clearly\nin the spirit of Hilbert who articulated matters in his second Hamburg\ntalk of 1927 as follows:\n\n\nThe formula game \u2026 has, besides its mathematical value, an\nimportant general philosophical significance. For this formula game is\ncarried out according to certain definite rules, in which the\ntechnique of our thinking is expressed. These rules form a closed\nsystem that can be discovered and definitively stated.\n\n\nThen he continues with a provocative statement about the cognitive\ngoal of proof theoretic investigations.\n\n\nThe fundamental idea of my proof theory is none other than to describe\nthe activity of our understanding, to make a protocol of the rules\naccording to which our thinking actually proceeds. (Hilbert 1927\n[1967: 475]) \n\n\nIt is clear to us, and it was clear to Hilbert, that mathematical\nthinking does not proceed in the strictly regimented ways imposed by\nan austere formal theory. Though formal rigor is crucial, it is not\nsufficient to shape proofs intelligibly or to discover them\nefficiently, even in pure logic. Recalling the principle that\nmathematics should solve problems \u201cby a minimum of blind\ncalculation and a maximum of guiding thought\u201d, we have to\ninvestigate the subtle interaction between understanding and\nreasoning, i.e., between introducing concepts and proving\ntheorems.",
