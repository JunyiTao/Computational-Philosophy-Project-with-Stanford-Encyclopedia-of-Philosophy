    "main_text": "Probabilistic Toolkit || Where do the numbers come from?\n1.4 Where do the numbers come from?\n\nIn the examples considered so far, probabilities were assigned on the\nbasis of empirical frequencies and expert opinions. For example, an\nexpert testimony that only 5% of people possess a particular blood\ntype was used to set \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg \\source)=.05\\).\nProbabilities were also assigned on the basis of common sense, for\nexample, \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\source)\\) was set to 1 assuming that if\nsomeone is the source of the crime traces, the person must match the\ncrime traces (setting aside the possibility of framing, fabrication of\nthe traces or false negatives in the test results). But probabilities\nneed not always be assigned exact values. Agreeing on an exact value\ncan in fact be extremely difficult, especially for prior\nprobabilities. This is a challenge for legal probabilism (see later in\n \u00a77.3).\n One way to circumvent this challenge is to avoid setting exact values\nand adopt plausible intervals. This method is based on sensitivity\nanalysis, an assessment of how prior probabilities affect other\nprobabilities.\n\nConsider the paternity case State v. Boyd (331\nN.W.2d 480, Minn. 1983). Expert witness Dr. Polesky testified\nthat 1,121 unrelated men would have to be randomly selected from the\ngeneral population before another man could be found with all the\nappropriate genes to have fathered the child in question. This formulation can be misleading since the expected number of matching DNA profiles need not be the same as the number of matching profiles actually found in a population (the error of thinking otherwise is called the expected value fallacy). On a more careful formulation, the probability that a random person \nwould be a  match is \\(\\slashfrac{1}{1121}\\), or in\nsymbols,  \n\n  \\[\\Pr(\\match\\pmid \\neg \\textsf{father})=\\frac{1}{1121}.\\]\n\n\nAs explained earlier in\n \u00a71.2.3,\n this probability cannot be easily translated into the probability\nthat a person whose genetic profile matches is the father, or in\nsymbols, \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father}\\pmid \\match)\\). The latter should be\ncalculated using Bayes\u2019 theorem:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(\\textsf{father}\\pmid \\match) & = \n    \\frac{\n        \\Pr(\\match\\pmid \\textsf{father}) \\times \\Pr(\\textsf{father})\n        }\n        {\n\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\textsf{father}) \\times \\Pr(\\textsf{father}) +\n  \\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\textsf{not-father}) \\times \\Pr(\\textsf{not-father})      \n  }   \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n In actual practice, the formula to establish paternity is more\ncomplicated (Kaiser and Seber, 1983), but for the sake of\nillustration, we abstract away from this complexity. Suppose the prior\nprobability that the defendant would be the father is as low as .01,\nor in symbols, \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father})=.01\\).  Plugging in this prior\nprobability into Bayes theorem, along with \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{m}\\pmid\n\\textsf{father})=1\\) and \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{m}\\pmid\n\\textsf{not-father})=1/1,121\\), gives a probability of paternity\n\\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father}\\pmid \\textsf{m})\\) that is equal to about .92.\n But why take the prior probability \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father})\\) to be .01\nand not something else? The idea in sensitivity analysis is to look at a range of plausible probability assignments and investigate the impact of such choices. In\nlegal applications, the key question is whether assignments that are\nmost favorable to the defendant would still return a strong\nevidentiary case against the defendant. In the case at hand, the\nexpert testimony is so strong that for a wide spectrum of the prior\nprobability \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father})\\), the posterior probability\n\\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father} \\pmid \\match)\\) remains high, as the plot in\n figure 1\n shows.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThe posterior surpasses .9 once the prior is above approximately .008.\nIn a paternity case, given the mother\u2019s testimony and other\nevidence, it is clear that the probability of fatherhood before the\nexpert testimony is taken into account should be higher than that, no\nmatter what the prior probability should exactly be. Without settling\non an exact value, the interval of values above .008 would guarantee a\nposterior probability of paternity to be at least .9. This is amply\nsufficient to meet the preponderance standard that governs civil cases\nsuch as paternity disputes (on standards of proof, see later in\n Section 5.)\n",
