    "main_text": "Propositional Functions and the Birth of Mathematical Logic\n3. Propositional Functions and the Birth of Mathematical Logic\nIn the work of Giuseppe Peano (1858\u20131932), we find another\nimportant step towards the modern notion of a propositional\nfunction. Although his work is not as sophisticated as Frege's (see\nbelow), it is important because it is influential particularly on\nBertrand Russell. \nIn his \u2018Principles of Arithmetic Presented by a New\nMethod\u2019 (1889), Peano introduces propositional connectives in the\nmodern sense (an implication, negation, conjunction, disjunction, and\na biconditional) and propositional constants (a verum and a falsum).\n\nMore important for us is his treatment of quantification. Peano\nallows propositions to contain variables, that is to say, he utilizes\nopen formulas. He does not give an interpretation of open\nformulas. He does not tell us what they represent. But they are used\nin his theory of quantification. Peano only has a universal\nquantifier. He does not define an existential quantifier in the\n\u2018Principles\u2019. The quantifier is always attached to a\nconditional or biconditional. Quantified propositions are always of\nthe form\n\nA \u2283x,y,\u2026 B\n\nor\n\nA =x,y,\u2026 B\n\nPeano reads \u2018A \u2283x,y,\u2026\nB\u2019 as saying \u2018whatever\nx,y,\u2026  may be, from the proposition A one\ndeduces B\u2019 and \u2018=\u2019 is Peano's biconditional, that he\ndefines in the usual way from the conditional and conjunction. But he\nprovides us with no more interpretation than that. He refers to\nvariables as \u2018indeterminate objects\u2019, but does not discuss\nwhat this or what a proposition (or propositional function) that\ncontains propositional objects might be.\n",
