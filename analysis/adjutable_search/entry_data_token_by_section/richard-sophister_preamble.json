    "main_text": "\n\n\nRichard the Sophister (Richardus Sophista) was an English\nphilosopher/logician who studied at Oxford most likely sometime during\nthe second quarter of the thirteenth century. Richard's identity is\nuncertain, but he is known to be the author of a collection of\nlogically puzzling sentences, sometimes called \u201csophisms\u201d,\nentitled Abstractiones. The puzzling aspect of these sophisms\nis variously caused by semantic or syntactic ambiguities involved in\ncertain logical or \u201csyncategorematic\u201d words such as\n\u201call\u201d, \u201cevery\u201d, \u201cor\u201d,\n\u201cif\u2026then\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201cnot\u201d,\n\u201cbegins\u201d, \u201cceases\u201d, \u201cexcept\u201d,\n\u201cnecessary\u201d, \u201cpossible\u201d, etc.\n",
