    "main_text": "The Domain of Intellectual Property || Trade Secret\n2.4 Trade Secret\n\nThe subject matter of trade secret law is almost unlimited in terms of\nthe content or subject matter that may be protected and typically\nrelies on private measures, rather than state action, to preserve\nexclusivity. \u201cA trade secret is any information that can be used\nin the operation of a business or other enterprise and that is\nsufficiently valuable and secret to afford an actual or potential\neconomic advantage over others\u201d (U.S. Legal Code, The\nRestatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, 1995, \u00a739). The secret\nmay be a formula for a chemical compound; a process of manufacturing,\ntreating, or preserving materials; a pattern for a machine or other\ndevice; or a list of customers. Trade secrets are not registered\nwith a government agency.\n\nThe two major restrictions on the domain of trade secrets are the\nrequirements of secrecy and competitive advantage. An intellectual\nwork is not a secret if it is generally known within the industry,\npublished in trade journals, reference books, etc., or readily\ncopyable from products on the market.\n\nAlthough trade secret rights have no built-in expiration, they are\nextremely limited in one important respect. Owners of trade secrets\nhave exclusive rights to make use of the secret only as long as the\nsecret is maintained. If the secret is made public by the owner, then\ntrade secret protection lapses and anyone can make use of it.\nMoreover, owners\u2019 rights do not exclude independent invention or\ndiscovery. Within the secrecy requirement, owners of trade secrets\nenjoy management rights and are protected from misappropriation. This\nlatter protection is probably the most important right granted, given\nthe proliferation of industrial espionage and employee theft of\nintellectual works. If a trade secret is misappropriated and made\npublic, courts may impose injunctive relief and damages. For example,\nif someone misappropriates a trade secret and publishes it on a\nwebsite, courts may require deletion and payment of fines.\n",
