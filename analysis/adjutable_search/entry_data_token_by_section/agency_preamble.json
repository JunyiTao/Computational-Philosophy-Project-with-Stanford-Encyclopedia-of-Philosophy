    "main_text": "\nIn very general terms, an agent is a being with the capacity to\nact, and \u2018agency\u2019 denotes the exercise or manifestation of\nthis capacity. The philosophy of action provides us with a standard\nconception and a standard theory of action. The former construes\naction in terms of intentionality, the latter explains the\nintentionality of action in terms of causation by the agent\u2019s\nmental states and events. From this, we obtain a standard conception\nand a standard theory of agency. There are alternative conceptions of\nagency, and it has been argued that the standard theory fails to\ncapture agency (or distinctively human agency). Further, it seems that\ngenuine agency can be exhibited by beings that are not capable of\nintentional action, and it has been argued that agency can and should\nbe explained without reference to causally efficacious mental states\nand events.\nDebates about the nature of agency have flourished over the past\nfew decades in philosophy and in other areas of research (including\npsychology, cognitive neuroscience, social science, and\nanthropology). In philosophy, the nature of agency is an important\nissue in the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of psychology, the\ndebates on free will and moral responsibility, in ethics, meta-ethics,\nand in the debates on the nature of reasons and practical\nrationality. For the most part, this entry focuses on conceptual and\nmetaphysical questions concerning the nature of agency. In the final\nsections, it provides an overview of empirically informed accounts of\nthe sense of agency and of various empirical challenges to the\ncommonsense assumption that our reasons and our conscious intentions\nmake a real difference to how we act.\n",
