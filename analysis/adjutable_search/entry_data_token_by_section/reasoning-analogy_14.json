    "main_text": "Philosophical foundations for analogical reasoning || A priori justification\n4.3 A priori justification\n\nAn a priori approach traces the validity of a pattern of\nanalogical reasoning, or of a particular analogical argument, to some\nbroad and fundamental principle. Three such approaches will be\noutlined here.\n\nThe first is due to Keynes (1921). Keynes appeals to his famous\nPrinciple of the Limitation of Independent Variety, which he\narticulates as follows:\n\n(LIV) \n The amount of variety in the universe is limited in such a way\nthat there is no one object so complex that its qualities fall into an\ninfinite number of independent groups (i.e., groups which might exist\nindependently as well as in conjunction) (1921: 258). \n\n\nArmed with this Principle and some additional assumptions, Keynes is\nable to show that in cases where there is no negative\nanalogy, knowledge of the positive analogy increases the\n(logical) probability of the conclusion. If there is a non-trivial\nnegative analogy, however, then the probability of the conclusion\nremains unchanged, as was pointed out by Hesse (1966). Those familiar\nwith Carnap\u2019s theory of logical probability will recognize that\nin setting up his framework, Keynes settled on a measure that permits\nno learning from experience.\n\nHesse offers a refinement of Keynes\u2019s strategy, once again along\nCarnapian lines. In her (1974), she proposes what she calls the\nClustering Postulate: the assumption that our epistemic\nprobability function has a built-in bias towards generalization. The\nobjections to such postulates of uniformity are well-known (see Salmon\n1967), but even if we waive them, her argument fails. The main\nobjection here\u2014which also applies to Keynes\u2014is that a\npurely syntactic axiom such as the Clustering Postulate fails\nto discriminate between analogical arguments that are good and those\nthat are clearly without value (according to Hesse\u2019s own\nmaterial criteria, for example).\n\nA different a priori strategy, proposed by Bartha (2010),\nlimits the scope of justification to analogical arguments that satisfy\ntentative criteria for \u2018good\u2019 analogical reasoning. The\ncriteria are those specified by the articulation model\n (\u00a73.5).\n In simplified form, they require the existence of non-trivial\npositive analogy and no known critical disanalogy. The scope of\nBartha\u2019s argument is also limited to analogical arguments\ndirected at establishing prima facie plausibility, rather\nthan degree of probability.\n\nBartha\u2019s argument rests on a principle of symmetry reasoning\narticulated by van Fraassen (1989: 236): \u201cproblems which are\nessentially the same must receive essentially the same\nsolution.\u201d A modal extension of this principle runs roughly as\nfollows: if problems might be essentially the same, then they\nmight have essentially the same solution. There are two\nmodalities here. Bartha argues that satisfaction of the criteria of\nthe articulation model is sufficient to establish the modality in the\nantecedent, i.e., that the source and target domains \u2018might be\nessentially the same\u2019 in relevant respects. He further suggests\nthat prima facie plausibility provides a reasonable reading\nof the modality in the consequent, i.e., that the problems in the two\ndomains \u2018might have essentially the same solution.\u2019 To\ncall a hypothesis prima facie plausible is to elevate it to\nthe point where it merits investigation, since it might be\ncorrect.\n\nThe argument is vulnerable to two sorts of concerns. First, there are\nquestions about the interpretation of the symmetry principle. Second,\nthere is a residual worry that this justification, like all the\nothers, proves too much. The articulation model may be too vague or\ntoo permissive.\n",
