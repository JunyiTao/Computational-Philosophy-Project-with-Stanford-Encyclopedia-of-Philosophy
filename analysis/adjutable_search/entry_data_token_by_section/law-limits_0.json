    "main_text": "Legal Moralism: Formulation and Structure\n1. Legal Moralism: Formulation and Structure\n\nLegal moralism is an initially simple and natural position to take in\ndelineating the legitimate boundaries of the legal use of coercion. At\nits heart is a strong link between moral wrongdoing and legal\n(especially criminal) wrongdoing. In the 1960s Herbert Hart applied\nthe label \u201clegal moralist\u201d to his intellectual sparring\npartner, Lord Patrick Devlin, and the label stuck (Hart 1963; Devlin\n1965). Devlin\u2019s account, which we come to below, has led to\nnumerous responses; beyond Hart himself a sample might include: Rostow\n(1960), Ronald Dworkin (1965), Ten (1972), Feinberg (1987), Kane\n(1994), Jeffrie Murphy (1999), Gerald Dworkin (1999), Kekes (2000),\nNussbaum (2004, 2010), Wall (2013). While many of the responses to\nDevlin have been heavily critical, the approach is alive and well and\ncontinues to develop in the hands, among others, of self-declared\nlegal moralists, such as Michael Moore and Antony Duff (Duff 2016: 96,\n2018; Moore 1997, 2014) and in writers who seem at least broadly\nfavourably disposed (Tadros 2016a: 169\u2013170). Something akin to\nit is also found implicit in a vast range of legal writing.\n\nLegal Moralism is often formulated in terms of immorality as a\nsufficient condition for legal coercion. Hart asks whether\nthe fact that conduct is immoral is \u201csufficient to justify\nmaking that conduct punishable by law?\u201d (Hart 1963 [1982:4]).\nLarry Alexander similarly defines legal moralism as \u201cthe\nposition that immorality is sufficient for criminalization\u201d\n(Alexander 2003: 131). Joel Feinberg\u2014mindful of the possibility\nthat a legal moralist might want to excise from the picture certain\nkinds of immorality\u2014defines legal moralism without mention of\nsufficient conditions:\n\n\nit can be morally legitimate to prohibit conduct on the\nground that it is inherently immoral, even though it causes neither\nharm nor offence to the actor or to others. (Feinberg 1984: 27,\nemphasis added)\n\n\nHowever, Hart\u2019s and Alexander\u2019s formulations are at best\nmisleading as characterizations of legal\n moralism;[1]\n and Feinberg\u2019s is incomplete by the measure of his own\nformulations of rival positions. What both leave out is the important\npoint that immorality or wrongdoing is generally taken by legal\nmoralists to be a prima facie or pro tanto ground\nfor the imposition of legal coercion, subject to potential defeat by\nother\n factors.[2]\n That certain conduct is by common standards immoral gives the\nsociety, in Devlin\u2019s view, \u201cprima facie right to\nlegislate\u201d (Devlin 1965: 11). The immorality is certainly a\nvalid reason for criminalization, but such a reason will fail to be\nconclusive if unable to override a series of potential defeating\nfactors that Devlin outlines. Accordingly, the\n\n\nappointed law makers of society have the duty to balance conflicting\nvalues\u2026and to form a judgement according to the merits of each\ncase. (Devlin 1965: 117)\n\n\nDevlin identifies a series of \u201cfactors which should restrict the\nuse of the criminal law\u201d, even where an immorality or moral\nwrong has been identified (Devlin 1965: viii). Balances must be struck\nas between \u201cfactors of principle\u201d and \u201cfactors of\nexpediency\u201d (we examine some of these in the next section).\nHence it will often be the case that the posited wrongness or\nimmorality will not be a sufficient ground for legal\ncoercion.\n\nAs far as Feinberg\u2019s formulation is concerned, it is perhaps\nrevealing to contrast his formulation of the harm principle (which we\ndiscuss below in\n section 4)\n with his formulation of legal moralism cited above.\n\n\nHarm to others: It is always a good reason in support of\npenal legislation that it would be effective in preventing\n(eliminating, reducing) harm to persons other than the actor (the one\nprohibited from acting) and that there is probably no other\nmeans that is equally effective at no greater cost to other\nvalues. (Feinberg 1984: 26, emphasis added)\n\n\nIn formulating his harm principle, Feinberg is careful to qualify his\ncentral claim with conditions relating to what would be\n\u201ceffective\u201d and of what the \u201ccost\u201d may be to\n\u201cother values\u201d. Not so, however, when he formulates legal\nmoralism. This may be no more than an oversight. However,\nconsiderations of the sort\u2014potential\n\u201ceffectiveness\u201d, \u201ccost to other\nvalues\u201d\u2014are central to legal moralists as will be seen in\nthe next section (Devlin 1965; Moore 1997: 663\u2013665). Stressing\nthese, as regards the harm principle, but omitting them, as regards\nlegal moralism, leaves the unfair impression that the former has a\nsubtlety and a realism that the latter lacks. Furthermore,\nFeinberg\u2019s formulation makes wrongdoing or immorality sound like\nsomething of an afterthought or a factor of only marginal importance\nto the criminalization question. The legal moralist by contrast sees\nwrongdoing or immorality not as marginal or in play only after harm\nand offence have had their due, but as central or pivotal. Wrongs, as\nDevlin would have it, \u201cshape\u201d crimes. Of the best\nknown\u2014murder, rape, battery, theft, fraud, arson\u2014so called\nmala in se\u2014we should say \u201ca moral idea shapes the\ncontent of the law\u201d (Devlin 1965: 27). It is true, the moralist\nwill say, that while these crimes are shaped by morality, the criminal\noffence of, say, murder is not identical to the moral wrong of murder\nas law will import various other requirements, of legality and so on;\nfor example the law\n\n\nmust trim the edges so that they present a line sharp enough for the\nclear acquittal or condemnation which the administration of justice\nrequires. (Devlin 1965: 27)\n\n\nThe wrongdoing is, however, essential. Hence the legal moralist takes\nmurder, fraud etc as ripe for criminalization because they are\nwrongful. They may (or may not) be wrongful because harmful;\nbut from the fact that harms form a significant subset of wrongs, we\nshould not be tempted to put the cart before the horse. Harms matter a\ngreat deal, but this is because they are often a kind of wrong. As\nDevlin\u2019s fellow legal moralist Michael Moore puts it\n\n\nwe care about harm to non-consenting victims because to cause such\nharms (and sometimes, to fail to prevent them) breaches our moral\nobligations. (Moore 1997: 649)\n\n\nIf one were to revise Feinberg\u2019s definition of legal moralism so\nas to be symmetrical with his definition of the harm principle one\nwould get something closer to the essence of the position: It is\n(always or sometimes) a good reason in support of penal legislation\nthat it would be effective in preventing (eliminating, reducing)\nwrongs and that there is probably no other means that is equally\neffective at no greater cost to other\n values.[3]\n\nLegal moralism, then, broadly comes in two parts, first, a wrong or\nimmorality is identified and, second, a set of countervailing factors\nare considered; and considered with the aim of reaching an\nall-things-considered-judgement on whether legal coercion should be\ndeployed. The wrong may be strong enough to see off the countervailing\nfactors, as the case may be, or the factors may be powerful enough to\ndefeat the wrong, all things considered. Thus, some wrongs will be\ntolerable, according to this position, and some will be intolerable.\nBeyond this core of the position, legal moralist accounts diverge\nsignificantly. Moore takes a specific philosophy of punishment, a form\nof retributivism, as an essential component of his account (Moore\n1997). Duff argues that only a subset of moral wrongs should be\ncriminalizable\u2014public, not private wrongs (Duff 2016, 2018).\nTadros, whose relationship to legal moralism is complex, also excludes\na subset of moral wrongs as potentially criminalizable, for example\n\u201cless serious wrongs committed in families\u201d (Tadros 2016a:\n131). Against this Moore accepts there is initially reason to\ncriminalize all kinds of morally wrongful conduct\u2014even\nbreach of contract or treachery among friends\u2014and leaves it to\nthe second part of the structure mentioned above, the countervailing\nfactors, to block the absurdity of criminalizing such conduct (Moore\n1997, 2016). There is also considerable variation between legal\nmoralists as to how \u201cmorality\u201d is to be understood.\nNotably, Devlin\u2019s understanding of morality is widely rejected\nby his successors. Below the flexibility of the approach will be\nemphasized. We return to the question of how the\n\u201cmorality\u201d in \u201clegal moralism\u201d is to be\nunderstood in\n section 3.\n",
