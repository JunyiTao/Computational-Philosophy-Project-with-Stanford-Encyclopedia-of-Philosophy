    "main_text": "Main Schools and Lineages || The \u201cSouthern Tradition\u201d\n3.2 The \u201cSouthern Tradition\u201d\n\nAfter the period of the Three Kingdoms (220\u201380), China was\nreunified by the Jin dynasty. Unification, however, lasted only for a\nfew decades. The southward migrations that followed the fall of the\ncapital Luoyang to the Xiongnu in 311 involved not only members of the\ncourt and the aristocracy, but also representatives of Tianshi dao. As\na result, the religion of the Celestial Masters reached Jiangnan, the\nregion south of the lower Yangzi river, and apparently for the first time came in\ntouch with the traditions of that region. The events that followed\nleft a permanent mark on the history of Daoism.\n\nThe native \u201cSouthern tradition\u201d comprised methods for\nsummoning benevolent deities and expelling demonic entities, various\ntypes of \u201clongevity practices\u201d, as well as meditation and\nalchemy (Andersen 1994; Campany 2002: 18\u201397; Steavu 2015). A\nsurvey of these traditions is given by Ge Hong (283\u2013343) in the\n\u201cInner Chapters\u201d (\u201cNeipian\u201d) of his Baopu\nzi (Book of the Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature, ca. 320).\nThis work (trans. Ware 1966; part. trans. Che 1999) provides a comprehensive overview of\nreligion in Jiangnan shortly before the arrival of the Celestial\nMasters, seen through the eyes of a member of one of the main families\nof Jiangnan aristocracy.\n\nAccording to Ge Hong, three textual bodies incorporated the higher\nreligious traditions of Jiangnan. The first consisted of scriptures\nbased on talismans (fu), mainly represented by the\nSanhuang wen (Script of the Three Sovereigns; Steavu 2019). Owning them,\nor even holding them in one\u2019s hands, granted protection against\nassaults of demons, dangers brought by external forces, and even\ndeath. The second and third textual bodies were based on meditation\nand alchemy, respectively, described by Ge Hong as the highest forms of\nself-cultivation. The main meditation practice is \u201cguarding the\nOne\u201d (shouyi), which consists in visualizing the god\nthat represents Unity in its multiple residences within the human\nbeing. Alchemical elixirs, instead, were superior to herbal drugs:\nwhile the \u201cmedicines of herbs and plants\u201d can only heal\nillnesses and grant a long life, the elixirs grant immortality.\n3.3 Shangqing (Highest Clarity) and Lingbao (Numinous Treasure)\n\nAgainst this background, the representatives of the religious legacies\nof Jiangnan responded to the newly-imported cults and rites of the\nCelestial Masters by reformulating and recodifying certain aspects of\ntheir own traditions in ways that also admitted elements of the new\nreligion. This led to the creation of two major new\n\u201cschools\u201d, which actually consist in two textual corpora\nand the related practices. The first one is Shangqing\n(Highest Clarity), based on revelations that occurred from 364 to 370\nnear present-day Nanjing (Strickmann 1977; Robinet 2000). Its main\nscripture, the Dadong zhenjing (True Book of the Great\nCavern), describes visualization methods of the inner gods, including\nillustrations, chants, and talismans (fu). This and other\nworks make clear that Shangqing incorporates earlier traditions, but\nreorganizes and ranks them in a different way compared to the past:\nmeditation is now the main practice, and even alchemy is modified to\ninclude processes that cannot take place in the laboratory but only\nwithin the adept\u2019s own person.\n\nWhile the main function of the Shangqing master is to transmit texts\nand oral instructions, the priest is at the center of the second\ncorpus. The Lingbao (Numinous Treasure) revelations occurred\nin the years 397\u2013402, when Ge Chaofu\u2014Ge Hong\u2019s\ngrand-nephew\u2014received another set of scriptures (Bokenkamp 1983;\nYamada 2000). The Lingbao synthesis of different traditions is even\nmore visible compared to Shangqing: it incorporates elements of\nTianshi dao ritual and pantheon, as well as certain aspects of\nShangqing itself (including visualization, performed for instance by the\npriest when he sends off his own inner gods to submit petitions to the\nhighest celestial deities). In addition, Lingbao shows the first\nsubstantial signs of the integration of Buddhist elements into Daoism:\nin particular, its notion of \u201cuniversal salvation\u201d\n(including a version of the \u201cBodhisattva vow\u201d) and also\nits cosmology, reflected in a system of ranked \u201cheavens\u201d\n(see\n \u00a75.1).\n At the center of Lingbao lies communal ritual. The new codification\nby Lu Xiujing (406\u201377), which followed the original revelations\nby a few decades, served as the blueprint for several later ones, and\nclear traces of it are still apparent in present-day Daoist\nritual.\n3.4 The \u201cThree Caverns\u201d\n\nWith the creation of the Shangqing and Lingbao corpora, Daoism for the\nfirst time clearly defined its two main poles, which consist of both\nindividual practices (codified in the Shangqing corpus) and communal\npractices (codified in the Lingbao corpus). In the 5th\ncentury, the relations among these corpora and the other traditions of\nJiangnan were formally defined in the system of the Three Caverns\n(sandong), which is traditionally attributed to Lu Xiujing\nbut clearly reflects the perspectives of the Daoist community as a\nwhole (Schipper and Verellen 2004: 14\u201317). In this system, the\nmain Daoist traditions and scriptural corpora of southeastern China\nare arranged into three hierarchical groups, namely (1) Shangqing, (2)\nLingbao, and (3) Sanhuang (Three Sovereigns, understood as\nthe Sanhuang wen and related textual materials). Each Cavern\ncorresponds to a heaven and is ruled by one of the three highest\nDaoist gods: Yuanshi tianzun (Celestial Venerable of the Original\nCommencement), Lingbao tianzun (Celestial Venerable of the Numinous\nTreasure), and Daode tianzun (Celestial Venerable of the Dao and Its\nVirtue, another name of the deified Laozi). The Three Caverns also\nprovided a model for other aspects of doctrine and practice, including\nthe ranks of priestly ordination and the classification of scriptures\nin the future Daoist Canons (id., 17\u201337). (On the Daoist Canon\nsee Schipper and Verellen 2004; a shorter survey is found in Bokenkamp\nand Boltz 1986.)\n3.5 Tang and Five Dynasties\n\nThe founding of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) was accompanied by\nmillenarian prophecies about the advent of a sage-emperor surnamed Li (Bokenkamp\n1994). As we saw before\n (\u00a72.5),\n this was also the surname of the Han-dynasty messiah; four centuries later, the\npowerful Li clan claimed to belong to Laozi\u2019s lineage, and its\nrise to the throne was supported by representatives of the Shangqing\nlineage. The Shangqing patriarch Wang Yuanzhi (528\u2013635) predicted the\nrise of the Tang, informed Li Yuan that he would become the next\nemperor, and secretly transmitted to him the \u201cregisters\u201d\nof the Celestial Mandate (tianming). Li Yuan\u2014the future Emperor Gaozu\u2014finally founded\nthe Tang dynasty. These events marked the beginning\nof the ascent of Shangqing to a status similar to \u201cstate\nreligion\u201d, which it maintained throughout the first half of the\ndynasty (Barrett 1996; Kohn and Kirkland 2000). The support of the\ncourt culminated in ca. 740 with the compilation of the Kaiyuan\ndaozang (Daoist Canon of the Kaiyuan Reign Period), the first of\na series of imperially-sponsored collections of Daoist texts.\n\nWhile the disastrous An Lushan rebellion of 755\u201363 put an end to\nthe glory of the Tang dynasty, for Daoism as a whole the Tang was an\nage of consolidation, but also of major changes and innovations. With\nregard to ritual, the Tang period and the successive decades of the\nFive Dynasties (907\u201360) were marked by two important new\ncodifications, respectively created by Zhang Wanfu (fl. 710\u201313;\nBenn 1991) and by Du Guangting (850\u2013933), one of the foremost\n\u201ccourt Daoists\u201d of all times (Verellen 1989). After its\nintroduction in the 1st century and its development during\nthe Six Dynasties, in the Tang period Buddhism became substantially\n\u201csinified\u201d with the rise of new schools, the most\nimportant of which are Tiantai and Chan (Jpn. Zen), and with the\nspread of \u201cpopular\u201d Tantric practices. (On Daoism and\nBuddhism see Z\u00fcrcher 1980 and Mollier 2008a; for an overview of\nthe main points, see Bokenkamp 2004.) This led to two phenomena that\nbecame constant in the second millennium: competition for state\npatronage, on the one hand, and repeated attempts to synthesize the\n\u201cThree Teachings\u201d (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism), on\nthe other. Intersections of Daoist and Buddhist thought and religion\nare visible in doctrines (Robinet 2004), cults (with several shared\ndeities, e.g., Avalokite\u015bvara/Guanyin; Mollier 2008a,\n174\u2013208), and meditation practices (see\n \u00a79.4).\n\nFinally, this period marked not only the highest stage of development\nof Waidan (External Alchemy), but also the beginnings of\nNeidan (Internal Alchemy; see\n \u00a710).\n The first clearly identifiable Neidan lineage is the Zhong-L\u00fc\n(named after the two immortals, Zhongli Quan and L\u00fc Dongbin),\nwhich appears to have developed from the second half of the Tang\nperiod.\n3.6 New Lineages in the Song Dynasty\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), major\nchanges in society\u2014in particular urbanization, the creation of a\nmarket economy, and the rise to prominence of new classes, especially\nin the southeastern regions\u2014led to major transformations in\nreligion. The institution of \u201clay associations\u201d, whose\nmain function was (in addition to performing various meritorious\nactions) supporting the local temple, was especially important in the\ndevelopment of Daoism, and at the same time in furthering the\nincorporation of cults to local deities and saints into the Daoist\npantheon and liturgy.\n\nThe Way of the Celestial Masters (then based at Mount Longhu, in\npresent-day Jiangxi) was officially assigned the task of ordaining\npriests, but a series of revelations resulted in the creation of\nlineages that, in several cases, claimed to have been\noriginated by Zhang Daoling himself. Between the mid-10th\nand the mid-13th centuries, five main lineages were\nestablished: Tianxin (Celestial Heart), Shenxiao\n(Divine Empyrean), Yutang dafa (Great Rites of the Jade\nHall), Lingbao dafa (Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure),\nand Qingwei (Pure Tenuity). All of them were based on\ndifferent codifications of ritual\u2014including exorcist\nrites\u2014but with little variation in the basic practices (Boltz 1987:\n26\u201349; Skar 2000). Local communities, in addition, had their own\nritual specialists, known as fashi (\u201critual\nmasters\u201d), a term that designated, as it still does in the\npresent day, lay officiants who specialize in exorcist practices\n(Davis 2001).\n\nThe Song dynasty and the successive Mongol Yuan dynasty\n(1271\u20131368) also saw important developments in the traditions of\nInternal Alchemy (Neidan), especially with the creation of\nNanzong, the Southern Lineage, which is ascribed with one of\nthe main codifications of the alchemical practice (see\n \u00a710.3).\n3.7 Quanzhen (Complete Reality, or Complete Perfection)\n\nIn 1127, the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234) captured Kaifeng,\nand the Song dynasty was obliged to move its capital to Hangzhou,\nestablishing the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279). It was under\nthe Jin rule that Quanzhen (Complete Reality, or Complete Perfection)\nwas created (Yao 2000; Goossaert 2001; Marsone 2010). This monastic\norder is, with the Way of the Celestial Masters, the main branch of\npresent-day Daoism.\n\nQuanzhen was founded by Wang Zhe (1113\u201370), who was active as a\npreacher in Shandong in the late 1160s, and by his seven main\ndisciples, among whom Ma Yu, Sun Bu\u2019er (the latter\u2019s\nwife), and Qiu Chuji deserve mention. Five \u201clay\nassociations\u201d were established to support the teaching, which\nspread rapidly. Controversies with Buddhism led to proscriptions in\nthe second half of the 13th century, which included the\nburning of a Daoist Canon recently compiled by Quanzhen\nrepresentatives. Quanzhen, however, maintained a strong local\npresence, and after the reunification of China under the Yuan dynasty\nit obtained again the favor of the court. While the Ming dynasty\n(1368\u20131644) gave priority to the Celestial Masters, Wang\nChangyue (1592\u20131680) gained the support of the newly-established\nManchu Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912). Since then, his\nLongmen (Dragon Gate) lineage has been the main branch of\nQuanzhen (Esposito 2004). In the present day, Wang Changyue\u2019s temple, the Baiyun\nGuan (Abbey of the White Cloud) in Beijing, is the\nseat of the China Daoist Association (Zhongguo daojiao xiehui).\n\nUnlike Tianshi dao, whose priests are married and live with their\nfamilies, Quanzhen is a celibate monastic order, and under this form\nit has propagated mainly in northern China. In addition to certain\nforms of ritual, the main practices of Quanzhen monks include\nmeditation and Internal Alchemy (Eskildson 2004). However, the overall\nimage of Quanzhen (and Longmen) is complex, as it also includes\nnon-institutional and non-monastic forms. At their origins lies the\nfact that Wang Zhe and his seven disciples are also identified as the\nso-called Beizong, or Northern Lineage, of Neidan; and especially the\nfact that Longmen as a whole traces its origins to the above-mentioned\nQiu Chuji, who is traditionally known as a Neidan practitioner. From\nthe Yuan period onwards, therefore, several masters and adepts of\nNeidan have claimed affiliation to Quanzhen and/or Longmen, and have\ncreated innumerable sub-lineages throughout China with little or no\nconnection to the central institution.\n4. Dao and Cosmos\n\nThis and the following three sections are concerned with subjects that\nare relevant to Daoism as a whole: cosmology, gods and rituals,\nsoteriology, and the views of the human being and the human body. In\ndifferent ways and to different extents, all of them have contributed\nto frame doctrines and practices of several Daoist schools or\nlineages.\n4.1 The Dao and the \u201cTen Thousand Things\u201d\n\nWhether it addresses itself to the community or the individual, Daoism\npurports to provide ways and methods for \u201creturning to the\nDao\u201d (fandao, huandao). Discussing the main\npoints of doctrine before approaching their particular subjects\nis\u2014in addition to references to Laozi and the Daode\njing, already noted above\u2014the other main way used in Daoist\ntexts to declare their affiliation to Daoism.\n\nIn the Daoist view, the Dao is both the \u201cultimateless\u201d (or\n\u201climitless\u201d, wuji, a term akin in meaning to\n\u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201cinfinite\u201d) and the \u201cgreat\nultimate\u201d (taiji). In the first sense, the Dao is\ndevoid of definition, determination, form, name, attributes, and\nqualities. Yet, it comprises all definitions,\ndeterminations, forms, etc., none of which could exist outside it.\nFrom the perspective of the \u201cten thousand things\u201d\n(wanwu, the objects and phenomena that exist and occur in the\nmanifested world), all that can be said is that they come about\n\u201cwithin\u201d the Dao, but the Dao is not the same as any of\nthem, or else it would be subject to, and limited by, their\nindividuality, form, change, and transitoriness. When the Dao, in the\nsecond sense, is understood as the \u201cgreat ultimate\u201d, it is\nseen as the supreme principle of Unity. This Unity, or Oneness, is\nmeant as the transcendent unity both beyond multiplicity (1 as the\norigin of numbers, but itself not a number) and as the origin of the\nmany (1 as the first number).\n\nIn the Daode jing, these two aspects of the Dao correspond to\nthe Dao as \u201cabsolute\u201d and as \u201cmother\u201d. The two\nmain ontologic and cosmogonic stages respectively prior and posterior\nto the creatio continua of the cosmos are often referred to\nas xiantian (precelestial, \u201cbefore Heaven\u201d) and\nhoutian (postcelestial, \u201cafter Heaven\u201d).\n4.2 Essence, Breath, Spirit\n\nWith its self-manifestation, the Dao gives birth to the three main\ncomponents of the cosmos. Collectively called the\n\u201cthree treasures\u201d (sanbao), these components are\njing, or Essence, qi, or Breath, and shen,\nor Spirit.[1]\nEach of them has two aspects, related to their unmanifested or\n\u201cprecelestial\u201d natures and to their\n\u201cpostcelestial\u201d forms in the manifested world. The same\nthree components are also seen as the primary components of the human\nbeing.\n\nIn their precosmic aspects, shen, qi, and\njing (in this order) represent three consecutive stages in\nthe process of the generation of the cosmos, from the initial state of\nNon-Being and Emptiness (wu, xu) to the coagulation\nof the Essence that finally generates the \u201cten thousand\nthings\u201d. Shen is the principle that presides over\nnon-material entities (including the celestial deities, which are also\ncalled shen, \u201cspirits\u201d or \u201cgods\u201d);\njing is the principle that presides over material entities;\nand qi is the principle that maintains the whole cosmos for\nits entire extent and duration and throughout its continuous changes.\nUnder these aspects, jing, qi, and shen are\nusually prefixed by the word yuan, \u201coriginal\u201d\n(yuanjing, yuanqi, yuanshen). In certain\ncases, Original Breath (yuanqi) is also seen as a principle\nprior to the emergence of Essence, Breath, and Spirit; when it is used\nin this sense, it is also called Ancestral Breath (zuqi) and\nis equated to the Dao itself.\n\nIn the manifested world, the three components take on different\naspects. With regard to the human being, shen emerges as the\nmind (the \u201ccognitive spirit\u201d, shishen, or\n\u201cthinking spirit\u201d, sishen); qi appears\nas breath; and the main materializations of jing are\u2014in\naddition to other liquid components of the body, such as saliva and\ntears\u2014semen in men and menstrual blood in women.\n4.3 Cosmogony\n\nTo explain the relation between Dao and cosmos, the Daode\njing describes a sequence of states taken on by the Dao,\nincluding the Dao itself, unity, duality (Yin and\nYang), and finally multiplicity: \u201cThe Dao generates the\nOne; the One generates the Two; the Two generate the Three; the Three\ngenerate the Ten Thousand Things\u201d (sec. 42). This basic sequence\nis always respected even though other texts or authors may mention\nadditional intermediate stages or exclude them (as does the\nZhuangzi: \u201cThe ten thousand things come forth from\nNon-Being\u201d; ch. 23; Watson 1968: 257). The vertical arrangement\nof the stages illustrates the process of descent from\nthe Dao to the cosmos, but also implies\u2014and often explicitly\noutlines\u2014a corresponding process of ascent from\nthe cosmos to the Dao, to be performed gradually and with the support of suitable\npractices.\n\nWhen this hierarchical arrangement is represented as a sequence of\nmetaphoric time stages, the discourse shifts from ontology to cosmogony. In\naddition to the one mentioned above, Daoism has elaborated several\nother accounts of cosmogony during its history (Robinet 1997a). Many\nof them focus on hundun, a term usually rendered as\n\u201cchaos\u201d or \u201cthe inchoate\u201d, in the sense of\nsomething that has just begun to be and therefore is not yet fully\nformed or developed, but from which the cosmos finally emerges (cf.\nDaode jing 25: \u201cThere is something inchoate and yet\naccomplished, born before Heaven and Earth\u201d). In a famous\npassage of the Zhuangzi, this state is represented by an\nemperor called Hundun who ruled \u201con the Center\u201d. As his\nbody had no openings, the Emperors of the North and of the South\ndecided to make him look similar to a human, providing him with eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth. \u201cEach day they\nbored one opening, and on the seventh day Hundun died\u201d (ch. 7;\nWatson 1968: 97). As shown by Norman Girardot (1983: 113\u201333),\nthis story attributes the cause of Hundun\u2019s death and the shift\nfrom chaos to cosmos not only to the emergence of duality\u2014the\nEmperors of the North and the South\u2014but also to the creation of\nsocial institutions. What brings the harmony of the \u201cchaotic\norder\u201d to an end is the emergence of the \u201csocial\norder\u201d.\n\nAmong later accounts (Kohn 1998: 179\u201397; Robinet 2002), Laojun\n(Lord Lao) began to be seen as the \u201cbody\u201d of the Dao, from\nwhich the cosmos is generated (Seidel 1969: 84\u201391). The Way of\nthe Celestial Masters (Bokenkamp 1997: 188\u201392; Seidel 1969:\n79\u201384) and Lingbao Daoism (Lagerwey 1981: 104; Bokenkamp 1997:\n380\u201381; Robinet 2002: 148\u201355) also created their own\ncosmogonies.\n4.4 Cosmology\n\nAfter the cosmos is generated, it is subject to the laws of cosmology.\nThe Chinese cosmological system\u2014often called \u201ccorrelative\ncosmology\u201d by Western scholars\u2014is a structured and\ncoherent corpus of knowledge that uses abstract emblems\n(xiang, lit. \u201cimages\u201d) to analyze and explain the\nfeatures of the cosmic domain and the relations that occur among its\ncomponents (Schwartz 1985: 350\u201382; Graham 1989: 319\u201356;\nKalinowski 1991). Among the main emblems are the following:\n\n The Northern Dipper (beidou, Ursa Major), which\nrepresents the center and the unity of the cosmos. Through its\napparent rotation around itself, the Dipper distributes its vital\nenergy (or \u201cbreath\u201d, qi) throughout the compass\nof space and the cycles of time.\n Yin and Yang, which are the main emblems of\nduality. They denote the two complementary forces\u2014one\n\u201cpositive\u201d, the other \u201cnegative\u201d\u2014that\nperform two main functions: they generate entities and phenomena\nthrough their conjunction, and they regulate the functioning of the\ncosmos through their cyclical alternation.\n The five agents (or five phases, wuxing), which serve to\nclassify and relate items belonging to different domains to one\nanother. Their names are Wood (mu), Fire (huo), Soil\n(tu), Metal (jin), and Water (shui). The\nagent Wood, for instance, classifies the direction east, the season\nspring, the numbers 3 and 8, the color green (or blue), the planet\nJupiter, the organ liver, and the acoustic phenomenon jue in\nthe same category. Four of the five agents also represent different\nstates of Yin and Yang: \u201cminor\nYang\u201d (Wood), \u201cgreat Yang\u201d (Fire),\n\u201cminor Yin\u201d (Metal), and \u201cgreat\nYin\u201d (Water). In the Daoist view, the five agents\nemblematize different modes or states taken on by the Original Breath\n(yuanqi) or the One Breath (yiqi) of the Dao in the\ncosmos. The function of the fifth agent, Soil, is especially\nimportant: being placed at the center, Soil stands for the source from\nwhich the other four agents derive, and guarantees the conjunction of\nthe world of multiplicity to Unity.\n The eight trigrams of the Yijing (Book of Changes),\nwhich are formed by different combinations of three broken\n(Yin) or solid (Yang) lines. Their names are\nZhen \u2633, Li \u2632, Dui \u2631,\nQian \u2630, Xun \u2634, Kan \u2635,\nGen \u2636, and Kun \u2637. The trigrams are\nrelated to divination practices, but their primary use in Daoism is\npurely emblematic; in particular, they represent different states of\nYin and Yang. With regard to space, for instance,\nthe trigrams refer to the directions; in this case, four of them\nrepresent the cardinal directions (just like four of the five agents),\nand the other four represent the intermediate directions.\n\n\nIn addition to those mentioned above, Daoist traditions draw several\nother images, concepts, and terms from the standard Chinese\ncosmological system, but one point requires mention. Cosmology\nprovides Daoism with tools to represent the unfolding of Unity into\nmultiplicity; to express the relation between Dao, cosmos, and human\nbeing; and to frame practices supported by microcosmic\nframeworks\u2014the ritual area, the alchemical laboratory, or the\nhuman body itself. These practices aim to provide means for\n\u201creturning to the Dao\u201d. This implies that, while the\nemblems of cosmology are suitable to represent the differentiation of\nUnity into the \u201cten thousand things\u201d, they also serve as\npointers for reverting from the \u201cten thousand things\u201d to\nUnity. To give one example, alchemists often represent the return to\nUnity as the reduction of the five agents to three and then to\none.\n5. Gods and Rituals\n\nIn China, the boundaries among Daoism, Buddhism, and the common\nreligion are much less marked compared to those among monotheistic\nreligions. According to individual needs and circumstances, lay\npersons may perform cults and address prayers and petitions\nindifferently to Daoist, Buddhist, or popular deities.\n\nThis has placed Daoism in close touch with the common religion, but\nhas also been the reason for a controversial relation. Daoism attempts\nto undertake the dual task\u2014by no means always\nsuccessful\u2014of drawing people closer to the deities that\nrepresent the Dao, while at the same time responding to their\nimmediate religious demands. As a consequence, in the words of Peter\nNickerson (2008: 148), \n\n\nTaoists, precisely because they relied upon traditions of practice\nthey claimed to have superseded, were compelled to try to distinguish\nthemselves from their popular predecessors and competitors. \n\n\nDemonizing the gods of popular religion was one of the options\n(Mollier 2005): in the course of its history Daoism has prohibited\ncults to minor deities and spirits, just like it has proscribed\nacupuncture (healing is supposed to occur by confession of sins or\nother ritual means overseen by a Daoist officiant) and divination\n(performed by lay specialists who do not belong to Daoist schools or\nlineages). Yet, plenty of examples show that the opposite attitude was\nalso applied. To quote Nickerson again, \n\n\nalready in early medieval times, Taoism was including in its rites a\nnumber of prohibited practices, and the popular cults themselves were\nbeginning to employ Taoist priests. (Nickerson, id.; on this subject\nsee also Stein 1979; Lagerwey 1987: 241\u201352).\n\n\nOne reason at the basis of these divergent\u2014more precisely,\ncontradictory\u2014attitudes may be the intent of exploiting the\npopularity of certain cults and the demand for certain basic religious\nservices. Another reason may be the attempt of not alienating lay\npersons and of paying tribute to local religious traditions. In any of\nthese cases, Daoism incorporates certain practices of common religion\ninto its rites and includes certain gods of common religion into its\npantheon. Yet, the stated purpose of Daoism remains the one of\n\u201ctransforming\u201d (hua) the people, a term that in\nthis context means educating them to venerate the deities that\nimpersonate the Dao, instead of relying on cults to minor deities and\nspirits and on rites performed by other officiants\u2014in\nparticular, the spirit-medium. Such cults and rites are defined in\nDaoism as \u201cvulgar\u201d (or \u201cprofane\u201d, su)\nand \u201cexcessive\u201d (or \u201cillicit\u201d, yin),\nand have been condemned throughout its history (Kleeman 1994). As\nhas been noted, the first competitor of the Daoist priest within local\ncommunities, in past and present times, is not the Buddhist monk or\nthe Confucian officer, but the spirit-medium (Seidel 1997: 62; see\nLagerwey 1987: 216\u201318, for an amusing but revealing\nepisode).\n5.1 Daoist Heavens\n\nDaoism represents the celestial realm as different systems of\n\u201cheavens\u201d, usually arranged hierarchically. In several\ncases, these domains are not only the residences of deities, but also\ncorrespond to degrees of priestly ordination and to inner spiritual\nstates, and are associated with revelations of teachings and textual\ncorpora. The existence of multiple systems reflects the development of\nthe religion. Different traditions created their own systems in order\nto demonstrate that the respective methods derive from a superior\ncelestial domain compared to those of other traditions, and therefore\nare more effective or grant access to a higher spiritual state.\n\nThe thirty-two heavens of Lingbao are arranged horizontally, with each\nheaven occupying one sector of an imaginary circle. At their center is\nthe Grand Veil (Daluo), the highest celestial domain. The\nlanguage spoken in these heavens is based on sounds represented in a\nform of pseudo-Sanskrit called Secret Language of the Great\nBrahm\u0101 (Bokenkamp 1997: 385\u201389). The thirty-six heavens of\nShangqing, instead, are arranged vertically. This system was created\nafter the Lingbao model and draws in part from it. In one of several\nlists, the highest heaven is again the Grand Veil. Below it are the\nheavens of the Three Clarities, followed by the four heavens of the\n\u201cSeed People\u201d (zhongmin, who survive beyond the end\nof the present cosmic cycle) and further below by the four heavens of\nFormlessness, the eighteen of Form, and the six of Desire.\n\nAs mentioned above\n (\u00a73.4),\n the Three Clarities (Sanqing) reflect the systematization of\nDaoist traditions after the Shangqing and Lingbao revelations. The\nterm itself defines both the three highest deities and the heavens in\nwhich they reside. While this became the classic Daoist model of the\ncelestial realms, it could be modified in several ways. Different\nsystems were devised in later times; these include the Shenxiao\ncosmography, which places the eponymous Divine Empyrean\n(shenxiao) at the center of nine celestial realms (Boltz\n1987: 26\u201333; Despeux 2000: 513).\n5.2 The Pantheon\n\nThe supreme Daoist deities are the Three Clarities (or Three Pures, Sanqing),\neach of which rules over one heaven (for their names, see\n \u00a73.4).\n They are associated with different pre-cosmic eras and are deemed to\nbe at the origins of the textual corpora associated with the Three\nCaverns. Along the history of Daoism, the Three Clarities have been\nsupplemented, but never replaced, by other deities that effectively\nmight share with them the title of \u201chighest Daoist\ndeities\u201d. Most important among them are Taiyi, or Great One, who\nrepresents the fundamental Unity of the cosmos in a deified form; and\nYuhuang, or Jade Sovereign, the highest god of popular religion before\nhis incorporation in the Daoist pantheon in the Song period.\n\nSeveral other gods, such as the \u201cemperors\u201d (or\n\u201cthearchs\u201d, di) of the five directions, represent\ncosmological principles. In addition, a multitude of deities, most of\nwhich originate from local cults and are shared with the common\nreligion, contribute to form a pantheon that is impossible to describe\nin full, as it takes different forms in different places and times\n(Lagerwey 2010: 19\u201355; iconography in Little 2000, Delacour et\nal. 2010, Huang 2012, and Fava 2013). To give a few examples, these\ndeities include the Queen Mother of the West (Xiwang Mu, an ancient\ngoddess of the immortals); the Mother of the Dipper (a deity of Indian\norigin, especially associated with children and childbirth); Mazu (a\nwoman who lived in the late 10th century and was deified as\nthe protector of sailors and fishermen, but also of women seeking\nchildren); Zhenwu (the protector of the Ming dynasty, related to the\nNorthern Dipper and provided with exorcist and healing powers);\nMarshall Wen (Wen Yuanshuai, who gave up his life to prevent\n\u201cplague spirits\u201d from poisoning local wells); and the\n\u201cplague spirits\u201d themselves, who are appeased in Daoist\nrituals called Plague Offerings (wenjiao).\n5.3 The Function of Writing\n\nThe highest gods reveal texts, teachings, and methods either directly\nor through their representatives. For instance, the Shangqing and\nLingbao scriptures are deemed to have taken shape from self-generated\ngraphs coagulated from Original Breath (Robinet 1993: 21\u201324), or\nfrom sounds generated by its vibration (Bokenkamp 1997: 386\u201387),\nin the early stages of the formation of the cosmos. They were\ntransmitted in Heaven until a \u201cdivine being\u201d or an\n\u201cimmortal\u201d transcribed them into characters understandable\nto humans.\n\nJust like the gods usually grant revelations in the form of\nscriptures, the typically Daoist form of communicating with the gods\nis by writing: as Anna Seidel remarked, the Chinese deities\n\u201cneither speak nor listen, but write and read\u201d (1997: 43).\nIn Daoist ritual, the priest delivers a \u201cmemorial\u201d (or\n\u201cstatement\u201d, shu) to the gods in order to\nannounce the ceremony performed in their honor, declare its purpose,\nspecify its program, and list the names of those who sponsor it\n(Schipper 1974). The so-called talismans (fu, a word almost\nexactly corresponding to the original meaning of Greek\nsymbolon) are traced on paper or other supports in graphs\nhardly comprehensible to humans but intelligible to the gods (Despeux\n2000; Mollier 2003). Like the revealed scriptures\u2014some of which,\nin fact, are deemed to have evolved from them\u2014talismans have\ncounterparts in Heaven, and thus serve to identify and authenticate\ntheir possessors in front of the gods. They confer the power to summon\ncertain deities and to control demons, but also protect space and heal\nillnesses; they are worn on one\u2019s body, affixed at the four\ndirections, placed along the path that leads to one\u2019s dwelling,\nor made into ashes and drunk with water.\n5.4 Rituals\n\nThe two main Daoist ceremonies in the present day are the Offering\n(jiao) and the Merit (gongde) rituals. (On their\nhistory and on earlier forms of ritual see Benn 2000; Andersen 2008;\nLagerwey 2010: 58\u201393). The Offering ritual (Lagerwey 1987:\n51\u2013167; Schipper 1993: 72\u201399; Dean 2000: 670\u201377) is\nperformed to renovate the bond between a community\u2014from the\nvillage to the empire\u2014and its gods. The Merit ritual (Lagerwey\n1987: 169\u2013237) is a funerary ceremony performed to ensure that\nthe deceased is not kept in the netherworld but may ascend to\nHeaven.\n\nThe communal ritual is requested and organized by the representatives\nof community via the local \u201clay association\u201d, which is\nalso in charge of the local temple or shrine. The main officiant is\nthe Daoist priest, or daoshi (lit. \u201cDaoist\nmaster\u201d), a function typically transmitted within families. When\nhe receives a request to celebrate an Offering, the daoshi\nconvenes his assistants to perform the ritual. The celebration\ntypically lasts one, two, three, five, or ten days, but arrangements\n(especially the preparation of the necessary paperwork) require a much\nlonger time. While the Offering is celebrated in the temple, a\nfestival is performed in the streets outside, with\nprocessions\u2014the statue of the local tutelary god is carried\nthrough the neighborhood\u2014music, and theatrical performances. In\naddition to this dual \u201couter\u201d and \u201cinner\u201d\naspect of the celebration, another important distinction is the one\nbetween the portions of the ritual that are public and those that are performed\nbehind closed doors, in which only the priests and selected representatives of the\nlocal community can participate.\n6. Soteriology\n\nTerms meaning \u201clong life\u201d (shou,\nchangsheng) and \u201cimmortality\u201d (busi,\netc.) are among the most recurrent ones in Daoist literature. Both\nhave been understood in different ways according to the perspectives\nof the respective texts and authors. In general, liberation has been\nrepresented in Daoism according to two main models: \u201cunion with\nthe Dao\u201d (hedao and similar terms) and incorporation\ninto the celestial bureaucracy (not as a deity, but as an officer of\nthat bureaucracy). The highest form of liberation is often described\nas \u201cascension to Heaven\u201d (shengtian), attaining\n\u201ccelestial immortality\u201d (tianxian), or in\nanalogous terms, but the general concept of immortality has been\nconstrued in many ways.\n6.1 The Immortals\n\nAccording to hagiographic works, the Daoist immortals are historical,\nsemi-historical, or entirely legendary persons who transcend the\nlimits of ordinary human existence, sometimes by birth but usually by means of their practices. As\ndescribed by Benjamin Penny (2000: 125\u201326), their powers include\nthe ability to transform themselves into different creatures or\nobjects; the possession of extraordinary bodies, devoid of signs of\naging and capable of stunning feats; the skill of controlling people,\nanimals, and objects by means of mastery of qi (the\nlife-giving \u201cbreath\u201d); the gift of healing; and the\nfaculty of predicting the future. The main power possessed by the\nimmortals, however, is certainly the ability to reach indefinitely\nlong lifespans. It is especially in hagiographic works that the idea\nof human \u201cperfectibility\u201d is understood in a sense that\nis, at the same time, most elementary and most idealistic: not only an\nexceptional longevity, but also the immortality of the physical\nbody.\n\nThe earliest extant hagiographic collections are the Liexian\nzhuan (Biographies of Exemplary Immortals; Kaltenmark 1953),\nprobably dating from the 1st century BCE, and the\nShenxian zhuan (Biographies of Divine Immortals; Campany\n2002), traditionally attributed to Ge Hong although no conclusive\nevidence is available about his authorship (Penny 1996). With the\nexception of works devoted to a single deity (in particular, Laozi in\nhis divine aspect; Kohn 1998: 7\u201336), hagiographies contain\nexemplary stories about men and women who have risen to a saintly\nstate (but not a \u201cgodlike\u201d state: the immortals are not\ngods). These stories are often related to local cults and reflect oral\ntraditions, but are typically composed by literati, including some who\ndo not have much to do with Daoism but are interested in the\n\u201cextraordinary\u201d and the unusual, or in the preservation of\nlocal traditions. More importantly, hagiographic works are intended\nfor open circulation and are not the object of transmission among\ninitiated or ordained Daoists. One may read them as\n\u201cintroductions to Daoism\u201d addressed to the general public,\nwhose knowledge of their subject matter often would not go much beyond\nwhat they read there.\n6.2 \u201cFeigning Death\u201d\n\nWhen we look at other sources, belonging to the various traditions\nthat have evolved during the history of Daoism, a different picture\nemerges. These sources show that Daoist adepts did not intend to reach\nimmortality in their physical body; they intended, instead, to make\nuse of their physical body in order to generate a new\n\u201cperson\u201d (shen) that is not subject to death. The\nrelated views and practices cover a wide spectrum of Daoism: from the\nearly Way of the Celestial Masters to late Internal Alchemy\n(Neidan).\n\nSome Daoist texts describe liberation as a rebirth that takes place in\nlife, but only after one forsakes one\u2019s mortal body. In the\nearliest account of this process, related to the Way of the Celestial\nMasters, the adept goes through a \u201cfeigned death\u201d\n(tuosi) and moves to a region of Heaven called Palace of\nTaiyin, or Great Darkness, where his physical body is\nrefined. This process culminates in a \u201crebirth\u201d, or\n\u201csecond birth\u201d (fusheng), in a body that\npreserves itself indefinitely (Bokenkamp 1997: 46\u201348 and\n102).\n\nNo details are given on how this process actually occurs.\n\u201cRefining the bodily form in Great Darkness\u201d, however, is\nsimilar and for some aspects identical to what many later Daoist texts\ncall shijie, \u201crelease from the mortal body\u201d or\n\u201cfrom the corpse\u201d (Robinet 1979: 57\u201366; Seidel 1987:\n230\u201332; Cedzich 2001; Campany 2002: 52\u201360; Pregadio 2004:\n121\u201326). After once again going through a \u201cfeigned\ndeath\u201d, the adept departs, only to return to live in the world,\ntypically on a mountain but at times among other human beings, in a\nperfected body that subsists indefinitely. A rare description of a\nrelevant practice, found in a source originally dating from the late\n3rd century, suggests that \u201crelease from the\ncorpse\u201d occurs in meditation. The adept is instructed to draw a\ntalisman and to visualize himself as \u201cbeing dead\u201d. Then he\ntakes off his clothes\u2014an act symbolic of his forsaken\npersonality\u2014and walks into the mountains, never to return where\nhe was born or lived (Cedzich 2001: 27\u201328; Campany 2002:\n54\u201355). Ritual elements are also involved. The adept stages his\ndeath, and his associates (family or Daoist companions) participate in\nthe performance: they state that his corpse has disappeared and has\nbeen replaced by other objects\u2014typically a sword (signifying a\nhigher form of release), a staff (signifying a lower one), or a pair\nof sandals (on which see Kaltenmark 1953: 40 and 52).\n\nThe adept who performs \u201crelease from the mortal body\u201d is\nalso said to change his name, so that he could escape the spirits\nbelonging to the bureaucracy of the underworld that manage the\n\u201cregisters of life and death\u201d. For this reason, this\npractice has been called \u201cdeceptive\u201d, in contrast to\ndirect ascension to Heaven, which would be a \u201cnonillicit method\nof transcendence\u201d (Campany 2002: 59). Yet, Daoist texts never\ndefine shijie as illicit, and state instead that this form of liberation is lower because of its temporary nature: those who\nundergo \u201crelease from the mortal body\u201d have not yet\nattained a state sufficiently advanced to attain complete liberation\nin life, and need a further period of refinement that cannot occur in\nthe bodily form in which they presently dwell. Significantly, the\nChinese term for \u201cchanging name\u201d (gaiming) is\nhomophonous of the term for \u201cchanging destiny\u201d.\n6.3 Re-Generation in Life\n\nShangqing (Highest Clarity) scriptures are the first ones to describe\nmeditation methods for the creation of an immortal body, or an\nimmortal self, through the generation of a new inner embryo. An\naccount of \u201crefining the bodily form in Great Darkness\u201d,\nfound in a Shangqing source, adds an important detail to what we have\nseen above, saying that the adept receives his second birth by going\nagain through his embryonic development (Robinet 1979: 63\u201366;\nStrickmann 1979: 182\u201383; Pregadio 2004: 124\u201325). Another\nexample is the practice of \u201cuntying the knots\u201d\n(jiejie). In the Shangqing view, human gestation accounts for\nthe creation of \u201cknots\u201d and \u201cnodes\u201d that serve\nto support the five viscera, but are ultimately responsible for\none\u2019s death. To untie them, the adept is instructed to create a\nnew embryo through a complex meditation practice (Robinet 1993:\n139\u201343; on the \u201cchange of destiny\u201d involved in this\npractice see Bokenkamp 2005b, 160\u201362).\n\nShangqing texts also describe meditation practices performed in order\nto save one\u2019s ancestors confined in the netherworld, who are\ntransformed into immortals by first returning to the embryonic state\n(Lagerwey 1981: 206\u20138; Robinet 1984: 1:170\u201373). Lingbao\nsources describe ritual practices performed for the same purpose\n(Bokenkamp 1989: 7\u201314). Several centuries later, these practices\nwould evolve in two main ways. The first is the method of Salvation\nthrough Refinement (liandu), in which a priest descends\ninto the hells to release the souls of the deceased and lead them to\nthe realm of Jade Clarity. Combining ritual and meditation, the entire\npractice takes place within the officiant: the celestial and infernal\nregions correspond to loci found within his own person, and the\ndeities involved in the practice are enabled to perform their salvific\nwork through his own body (Lagerwey 1987: 232\u201335; Boltz 1983).\nThe second development is Neidan, or Internal Alchemy, whose\npractice is often described as the conception, gestation, and delivery\nof an immortal embryo (see\n \u00a710.3).\n7. Views of the Human Body\n\nIt is virtually impossible to distinguish the Daoist understanding of\nthe human body from its understanding of the human being as a whole,\nand this point constitutes on its own a central aspect of the Daoist\nway of seeing. Daoism is not interested in anatomy or physiology. The\nphysical body performs a different function: it supports various sets\nof metaphors that express the relation of the whole person to the\nultimate principle, the Dao.\n\nThe emphasis given to the symbolic aspects of the body is also the\nmain aspect under which Daoism differs from Chinese traditional\nmedicine: Daoism sees the body as an instrument for \u201creturning\nto the Dao\u201d. Catherine Despeux draws attention to this point by\nnoting that Daoists \n\n\nhave considered the body in its practical ends, in its uses,\ndeveloping all kinds of body techniques that intend to liberate the\nindividual from the constraints of the physical body, and consequently\nto entrust a major role to the symbolic body. (translated from Despeux\n1996: 87\u201388)\n\n7.1 Terminology\n\nThe ordinary Western understanding of the body as physical frame or\nstructure cannot convey the complexity of the premodern Chinese view.\nThis view revolves around three main terms. The first, ti, or\n\u201cbody\u201d, refers to the corporeal frame as an ordered whole\nmade of interdependent parts; it denotes the physical body made of\nskin, flesh, limbs, bones, muscles, tissues, vessels, and all other\nmaterial components. The second term, xing, or\n\u201cform\u201d, is best understood\u2014at least in a Daoist\nperspective\u2014in contrast to the idea of\n\u201cformlessness\u201d (wuxing), which pertains to the\nDao. In this sense, \u201cform\u201d refers to the embodiment as the\nfeature that identifies each entity in the \u201cworld of\nform\u201d, distinguishing it from\u2014and relating it to\u2014all\nother entities. Therefore the \u201cform\u201d, rather than the\n\u201cbody\u201d, is the principle of individuality at the physical\nlevel. The third term, shen, is the most comprehensive: it\ndenotes the human being in all of its physical and non-physical\naspects. Shen often is best translated as\n\u201cperson\u201d and at times can also be rendered as\n\u201coneself\u201d. For example, an expression such as\nxiushen means \u201ccultivating one\u2019s person\u201d or\n\u201ccultivating oneself\u201d; it refers to cultivating not only\nthe body, but the entire person. (Explications of these terms, some of\nwhich differ from the understanding suggested here, are found in Kohn\n1991: 241\u201347; Sivin 1995: 14; Despeux 1996: 88\u201389;\nEngelhardt 2000: 95\u201396.)\n\nEach facet of the \u201cbody\u201d mentioned above requires the\nother two, but the variety of concepts embraced by these terms raises\nthe question of which among them is at the center of the Daoist\ndiscourse. It could hardly be said that Daoism focuses on the physical\nbody: as shown below, several loci at the basis of Daoist\npractices\u2014for instance, the three Cinnabar Fields\n(dantian)\u2014do not even exist at the purely physical\nlevel. In other cases, the loci at the basis of Daoist practices have\ncorporeal counterparts, but their emblematic functions are more\nsignificant than those performed by the body parts themselves. The\nmain example is the five viscera (wuzang). In its discourse\non the viscera, Daoism shows little or no interest in the physical\norgans per se; the viscera serve, instead, as material\nsupports for the network of correspondences that tie the human being\nto its immediate and remote surroundings: society and cosmos.\n7.2 Models of \u201cSymbolic Body\u201d\n\nA merely anatomical view of the body, therefore, is the least of all\nconcerns in Daoism. Rather than ti (the physical body), the\nDaoist discourse and practices focus on xing (the\n\u201cform\u201d) and shen (the whole person). Maintaining\nthe physical body in good health is not an end in itself; it serves to\nensure that the body and its parts and organs may fulfill their\nemblematic functions.\n\nThese emblematic functions pertain to what Kristofer Schipper has\ncalled the \u201csymbolic vision\u201d of the body (1993: 104 ff)\nand Catherine Despeux has called the \u201csymbolic body\u201d\n(1996: 98). This view is centered on several key notions and\nrepresentations, which receive more or less emphasis according to the\nindividual cases. Five different models of the body can be\ndistinguished within Daoism as a whole:\n\n The cosmological model, where the human being is seen as a\nmicrocosm that contains and reproduces all of the main features of the\nmacrocosm.\n The political model, where the human being is likened to an\nadministrative system, which in turn parallels the bureaucratic\nsystems of the state and of the heavens.\n The theological model, which sees the body as the residence of\ninner gods visualized and nourished in meditation (see\n \u00a79.1\n below).\n The natural model, which pertains to representations of the body\nas a landscape\u2014in particular, a mountain\u2014with peaks,\nwatercourses and other features corresponding to specific internal\nloci or to \u201cflows of energy\u201d (for graphic representations,\nsee Huang 2012: 78\u201381).\n The alchemical model, where the body is seen as containing the\ningredients of the elixir and the tools required to compound it,\nincluding furnace, tripod, and fire.\n\n\nThese five representations are not competing models, and in fact often overlap\none another. For instance, the principles that operate in the cosmos\nand the inner deities that personify those principles are to a large\nextent equivalent: one may understand and represent those principles\nin abstract terms, in deified forms, or simultaneously in both ways.\nCertain aspects of the cosmological and the alchemical models are\nidentical. Similarly, illustrations of the body as a landscape also\ninclude the palaces that function as headquarters for the\nadministration of the body (Huang 2012: id.).\n7.3 Main Components and Loci\n\nIn addition to the different models outlined above, the Daoist view of\nthe body is grounded on several components and loci that are not\nphysical in the ordinary sense, or that perform functions going beyond\nthose of the corresponding physical organs. The three main\ncomponents\u2014jing or \u201cessence\u201d, qi\nor \u201cbreath\u201d, and shen or\n\u201cspirit\u201d\u2014have been discussed above\n (\u00a74.2).\n Only a few of the others will be mentioned here.\n\nThe center of the human being is represented in different ways; and\nnot being material, it may have different symbolic locations and\nnames. Most important among them is the Heart (xin, a word\nalso meaning \u201ccenter\u201d). Related images and terms include\nthe Yellow Court and the Mysterious-Female. The Yellow Court\n(huangting, where \u201cyellow\u201d is the color of the\ncentral agent Soil, and the \u201ccourt\u201d is the central\ncourtyard in traditional Chinese houses) has different\ndefinitions. When the framework of reference is the three Cinnabar\nFields, it may denote any of them, and especially the central one,\ncorresponding to the heart; when it is the five agents, it denotes the\nspleen, which is placed at the center of the five viscera and\ncorresponds to Soil. The Mysterious-Female (xuanpin, a term\nderived from the Daode jing and often translated as\n\u201cmysterious female\u201d) is the immaterial locus of the\nconjunction of Yin (the \u201cfemale\u201d) and Yang (the\n\u201cmysterious\u201d).\n\nThe three Cinnabar Fields (dantian) are the lower Cinnabar\nField (the dantian proper), which is found in the region of\nthe abdomen and is the seat of the Essence (jing); the middle\nCinnabar Field, which is found in the region of the heart and is the\nseat of Breath (qi); and the upper Cinnabar Field, which is\nfound in the region of the brain and is the seat of Spirit\n(shen). In meditation practices, the three Fields are the\nresidences of the Three Ones (Sanyi), who represent the One and its\nsubdivision into the Two. In Neidan (Internal Alchemy, on which see\n \u00a710.3),\n they are the loci of the conception, nourishment, and delivery of the\nalchemical embryo.\n\nImportant symbolic functions are performed by the five viscera\n(wuzang), namely the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and\nkidneys. They are related, in this order, to the agents Wood, Fire,\nSoil, Metal, and Water. This makes the viscera the main support for\nthe macrocosm-microcosm doctrine in Daoism. The three Cinnabar Fields\nand the five viscera respectively reproduce the vertical and\nhorizontal dimensions of the cosmos within the human being.\n\nMany Daoist texts also refer to the hun and the po,\ntwo untranslatable terms often rendered as \u201cspiritual and\nmaterial souls\u201d, \u201ccelestial and\nearthly souls\u201d, or in similar ways. The hun stands for\nthe Yang and lighter components of the human\nbeing that pertain to Heaven and return there after death. The\npo stands for the Yin and grosser\ncomponents that pertain to the Earth and return there when death\noccurs. According to different views, the hun and the\npo may be single or multiple; in the latter case, the\nhun are three, and the po are seven.\n\nFinally, the human body also hosts two sets of parasites: the\n\u201cthree corpses\u201d (sanshi), which reside in the\nhead, the chest, and the legs; and the \u201cnine worms\u201d\n(jiuchong), which live in different parts of the body. All of\nthem cause weakening, diseases, and death. The \u201cthree\ncorpses\u201d are also said to report periodically one\u2019s\ntransgressions to Heaven, which results in the shortening of\none\u2019s life span. As these parasites feed on cereals,\n\u201cabstaining from grains\u201d (bigu) was one of the\nways to expel them.\n8. \u201cNourishing Life\u201d\n\nDaoist self-cultivation teachings and practices can be subdivided into\nthree main groups:\n\n Yangsheng (Nourishing Life), including such methods as\ndaoyin, breathing, sexual practices, and dietetics\n Meditation, including visualization of the inner gods, meditation\non Unity, \u201cinner journeys\u201d to constellations or to the\nremote corners of the cosmos, and methods focused on contemplation and\ninsight\n Alchemy, including Waidan (External Alchemy) and Neidan (Internal\nAlchemy)\n\n\nWhile Confucianism saw the cultivation of ethical and moral principles\nas the highest pursuit in a person\u2019s life, Daoism deems those\nprinciples to be the foundation of one\u2019s self-cultivation. In\nthe Daoist perspective, ethics and morals therefore are not a branch\nof \u201cphilosophical thought\u201d, but also pertain to the basic\nfield of Nourishing Life. (On Daoist precepts see Schipper 2001, and\nthe translation of a representative text in Hendrischke and Penny\n1996.)\n\nThis and the next sections are concerned with the three main groups of\nteachings and practices mentioned above.\n8.1 Practices\n\nYangsheng or Nourishing Life is the general designation of a\nvariety of practices designed to benefit the body (Engelhardt 2000).\nThe term is so indefinite that no precise list can be drawn of what\npertains to \u201cnourishing life\u201d. Nevertheless, relevant\nmethods would certainly include daoyin, breathing, and sexual\npractices. Present-day practices often defined as\n\u201cDaoist\u201d, such as Qigong and Taiji quan,\nmay also be seen as belonging to Yangsheng.\n\nDaoyin (lit., \u201cguiding and pulling\u201d; Despeux\n1989; Kohn 2008) can be defined, in Western terms, as a sort of\ngymnastics, in the sense that it grants physical agility and\ncoordination. In a different reference frame, its formal features and\nits place in Daoism bear analogies to what hatha yoga is in Hinduism.\nThe purpose of daoyin postures and movements is to allow the\nunhindered flow of qi within the body. The practice is known\nto have existed at least by the 3rd or 2nd\ncentury BCE (trans. of a Mawangdui manuscript, Harper 1998:\n310\u201327). Only one text on daoyin is found in the Daoist\nCanon (trans. Kohn 2012, in a chapter oddly entitled \u201cInternal\nAlchemy\u201d).\n\nBreathing practices exist in many varieties. The most common general\nterms are xingqi (\u201ccirculating breath\u201d) and\ntuna (\u201cexhaling [the old] and inhaling [the new\nbreath]\u201d). Particular practices include biqi\n(\u201cretaining breath\u201d), buqi (\u201cspreading\nbreath\u201d), lianqi (\u201crefining breath\u201d), and\ntiaoqi (\u201charmonizing breath\u201d). Another celebrated\nterm is zhongxi (\u201cbreathing through the heels\u201d),\nused in the Zhuangzi to designate the spontaneous breathing of\nthe realized person, which does not stop at the lungs but circulates\nthroughout the entire body (ch. 6; Watson 1968: 78). Two especially\nimportant practices are the ingestion of the \u201cbreaths\u201d of\nthe four directions (Raz 2013), and the so-called \u201cembryonic\nbreathing\u201d (taixi), which purports to replicate the\nbreathing of an embryo in its womb (Maspero 1981: 459\u2013505).\n\nSexual practices are commonly defined in Chinese as fangzhong\nshu or \u201carts of the bedroom\u201d (Maspero 1981:\n517\u201341). The large amount of literature existing on this subject\nshows that these arts are, with few exceptions, primarily addressed to\nmales (another common term that defines them is yun\u00fc,\n\u201criding women\u201d). Their main purpose is to avoid\nejaculation: semen should be prevented from being emitted and should\ninstead be \u201creturned to the brain\u201d (which is deemed to be\nthe origin of the marrow, in its turn the source of semen). This\nmethod is known as huangjing bunao, \u201creverting the\nessence to replenish the brain\u201d.\n8.2 Criticism\n\nWhile in Chinese popular culture and in the Western re-invention of\nDaoism the \u201carts of the bedroom\u201d are often seen as Daoist,\nsexual practices performed in the history of Daoism are of a different\nkind. They include the heqi (\u201cjoining breaths\u201d or\n\u201cpneumas\u201d) ritual, practiced in the early Tianshi\ndao (Way of the Celestial Masters) between married couples in\norder to generate the \u201cseed people\u201d (zhongmin),\nwho would survive the impending end of world (Raz 2012: 186\u2013202;\nKleeman 2014; Mollier 2016). Certain traditions of Neidan (Internal\nAlchemy) also involve sexual conjunction, performed in order to enable\nthe male practitioner to collect the True Yang from the\nYin (represented in this case by the sexual essences produced\nby the female). In Neidan, these practice are contrasted with\nqingxiu, literally meaning \u201cpure\ncultivation\u201d.\n\nSeveral Daoist texts emphasize that the Yangsheng methods should not be\nperformed as the only way for \u201creturning to the Dao\u201d.\nOthers\u2014beginning with the Zhuangzi (ch. 15; Watson\n1968: 167\u201368)\u2014express criticism towards them. While some\nscholars have looked at these contrasts as examples of competition\ntaking place in a sort of \u201cself-cultivation market\u201d,\nDaoist authors take into account the state of realization afforded by the Yangsheng methods, which in their view is lower compared to other practices.\n9. Meditation\n\nDaoist meditation practices can be divided into four main types: (1)\nVisualization of inner gods; (2) Meditation on Unity, or the One; (3)\n\u201cExcursions\u201d to astral bodies and constellations, or to\nthe remotest poles of the cosmos; (4) Inner contemplation.\n9.1 Inner Gods\n\nAccording to Daoist traditions documented from around 200 CE, the\nhuman being hosts a veritable pantheon of gods. These deities perform\nmultiple roles related to one another: they allow the human being to\ncommunicate with the corresponding gods of the celestial pantheon,\nserve as administrators of the human body, and guard the balance of\nthe body\u2019s main functions.\n\nSeveral texts describe the features of the inner gods. One of the main\nsources, the Huangting jing (Book of the Yellow Court; ca.\n200 CE; Robinet 1993: 55\u201396; Despeux 2012: 128\u201349),\nmentions, for instance, a major series of gods that live within the\nfive viscera. Significantly, each of these organs is called a\n\u201cdepartment\u201d (bu), the same term that denotes a\ngovernment \u201cministry\u201d, and each of these gods is said to\nreside in a \u201cpalace\u201d. These and other details, such as\nnames, appearances, dimensions, and garments of the gods, are\nmentioned as supports for meditation practices. In agreement with the\nclassical Chinese views on the fateful separation of the spirit\n(shen) from the body, several works warn that if the inner\ngods (also called shen) leave their residences, a person dies.\n\u201cMaintaining one\u2019s thoughts\u201d (cun) on them\nenables one to keep them in their corporeal dwellings.\n\nThese deities are not deemed to possess physical existence in the\nordinary sense of the word. They pertain, instead, to a domain that\nlies midway between formlessness and form; as noticed by Isabelle\nRobinet, they are \u201cimages\u201d (xiang) that play an\nintermediary function \u201cbetween the world of sensory realities\nand the world of the unknowable\u201d (1993: 50). The person in whom\nthe gods reside is neither possessed by them nor is\n\u201cdeified\u201d by their presence (for a different view, see\nPuett 2002:\n226\u201327). The practitioner, instead, becomes the focus of a\ndivine representation, of which he is the lone creator and the lone\nspectator. The organs and loci in which the gods reside cease to be\nmere \u201cbody parts\u201d, and become the supports that make that\nrepresentation possible.\n\nThe inner gods are literally innumerable and different texts describe\ndifferent pantheons (Pregadio 2005: 131\u201341), but here only the\nmost important one can be mentioned. Known as the Red Child (Chizi),\nhe is featured in the Laozi zhongjing (Central Book of Laozi;\nprobably ca. 200 CE; Schipper 1993: 100\u201312; Schipper 1995;\nLagerwey 2004a). The speaker of this text is Laozi; in fact, the Red\nChild is no other than Laozi himself, now playing the role of\n\u201ctrue self\u201d (zhenwu) of each human being. He\ndefines himself as \u201cthe child of the Dao\u201d, adding that he\nresides in the stomach (another symbolic center of the person) where\nhe is nourished by his mother and protected by his father. Like other\ninner gods, however, the Child should also be nourished by the person\nin whom he lives: in particular, a \u201cyellow essence\u201d\n(huangjing) and a \u201cred breath\u201d (chiqi),\nrespectively associated with the Moon (Yin) and the Sun\n(Yang), should be delivered to him by the adept in\nmeditation.\n\nAs an image of the \u201ctrue self\u201d, the Red Child is the main\nprecursor of the \u201cembryo\u201d that, several centuries later,\nadepts of Neidan would generate and nourish by means of their own\npractices\n (\u00a710.3).\n9.2 The One and the Three Ones\n\nMeditation practices focused on the principle of Unity are known as\n\u201cguarding Unity\u201d or \u201cguarding the One\u201d\n(shouyi), an expression analogous in meaning to\n\u201cembracing Unity\u201d (baoyi) found in the Daode\njing (sec. 10 and 22). In his famous speech to the Yellow\nEmperor, recorded in the Zhuangzi, Guangcheng zi says,\n\u201cI guard this Unity and thus abide in this harmony\u201d (ch.\n11; Watson 1968: 120).\n\nWhile in these examples \u201cguarding Unity\u201d refers to the\nconstant awareness of the One as the principle of the many, in later times the\nsame expression designates meditation practices based on the\nvisualization of the One as an anthropomorphic inner deity. A\nclassical description is found in the Baopu zi, where Ge Hong\nreckons \u201cguarding the One\u201d as the superior way of\ntranscendence together with the ingestion of elixirs. The main\npractice consists in visualizing the features that the One as a god\ntakes within the human being as it moves among the three Cinnabar\nFields. Meditation on the One as an inner god is also described in the\nLaozi zhongjing and in the Dadong zhenjing.\nLater,\nthis practice evolved into \u201cguarding the Three Ones\u201d\n(shou sanyi), which again exists in several varieties\n(Andersen 1979; Robinet 1993: 119\u201338). For instance, the Three\nOnes are represented as three children who live in the\nCinnabar Fields. Another practice combines external and\ninternal aspects: after visualizing the descent of the\nNorthern Dipper above his head, the adept sees the Three Ones emerging\namong its stars; he breaths three times, and each time one of the\nThree Ones reaches its residence in the respective Cinnabar Field.\n9.3 \u201cPacing the Celestial Net\u201d\n\nShangqing Daoism also developed meditation practices that take adepts\nto the extremities of the cosmos or to the Sun, the Moon, and other\nastral bodies (Robinet 1993: 171\u201385 and 187\u2013230). For some\nof their features, these practices are related to the\n\u201cfar roaming\u201d described in pre-Han and Han literary works\n(see\n \u00a72.2).\n The Dipper, in particular, is the heavenly residence of the Great One\n(Taiyi); it is made of nine stars, two of which are said to be visible\nonly by advanced adepts. One of the nine stars, called Heavenly Pass\n(tianguan), allows the adept to exit the cosmos and access\nthe domains placed above and beyond it. The meditative walk on the\nstars was called Pacing the Celestial Net (bugang). It\nincorporated the ancient ritual practice of the Steps of Yu\n(yubu), which imitated the lamely way of walking of the\nmythical Emperor Yu, but also included cosmological and numerological\nelements (Andersen 1989\u201390).\n9.4 Contemplation\n\nFrom approximately the 7th century, the meditation\npractices outlined above were largely replaced by methods of\ncontemplation and introspection (Kohn 2010). While their closeness to\nBuddhism is manifest, their roots also lie in early teachings and\npractices such as those described in the Neiye (Internal\nTraining), dating from the second half of the 4th\ncentury BCE (Kirkland 2004: 39\u201352; Roth 1999; Graziani 2001),\nand in the above-mentioned speech of Guangcheng\nzi to the Yellow Emperor (Zhuangzi, ch. 11; Watson 1968:\n118\u201320).\n\nOne of the main sources on contemplation (guan) methods is\nthe Neiguan jing (Book of Inner Contemplation; Kohn 2010:\n179\u201387), another text spoken by Laozi in his deified aspect.\nThis work emphasizes that the original state of clarity and purity is\nlost when the mind is overcome by passions and attachments caused by\nsensual cravings. When the mind is stabilized, disordered thoughts do\nnot arise; one then does not only reach the state of quiescence, but\nthe state in which both movement and quiescence are transcended.\n\nThe Qingjing jing (Book of Clarity and Quiescence; Kohn 1993:\n24\u201329) is another influential work, also dating from the Tang\nperiod and also spoken by Laozi. It states that the innate clarity and\nquiescence of the mind and the spirit are defiled by passion and lust\nowed to the separation of original Unity into the two complementary\nprinciples. Only by realizing that mind, forms, and individual objects\nare devoid of an underlying nature is it possible to awaken to their\nfundamental emptiness. This is attained by contemplation, and leads\none to the recovery of the \u201cclarity and quiescence\u201d\nmentioned in the title (an expression derived from the Daode\njing, sec. 45). Among the main uses of this work was, and still\nis, its daily recitation by Quanzhen monks, nuns, and adepts.\n10. The External and the Internal Elixirs\n\nAlchemy developed in China in two main branches. Waidan, or External\nAlchemy, is based on compounding elixirs through the manipulation of\nnatural substances\u2014primarily minerals and metals\u2014which\nrelease their essences when they are submitted to the action of fire.\nNeidan, or Internal Alchemy, aims to produce the elixir within the\nalchemist\u2019s person according to two main models of doctrine and\npractice: first, by\ncausing the primary components of the cosmos and the human\nbeing\u2014Essence, Breath, and Spirit\u2014to revert to their\noriginal states; and second, by purifying one\u2019s mind of defilements and\npassions, in order to \u201csee one\u2019s Nature\u201d\n(jianxing), which is equated to the elixir.\n10.1 Waidan or External Alchemy\n\nIn the Taiqing (Great Clarity) tradition of Waidan, which\ndeveloped from the 3rd century CE, the alchemical practice\nis framed as a complex ritual sequence (Pregadio 2006). The initial\nstage is the ceremony of transmission, followed by a period of\nretirement and purifications. Then, having protected the ritual space\nby means of talismans (fu), the alchemist builds the\nlaboratory, or \u201cchamber of the elixirs\u201d (danshi).\nAt a time deemed to be suitable according to traditional hemerology,\nthe alchemist performs a ceremony for kindling the\nfire\u2014including a request of assistance addressed to Laojun (Lord\nLao) and other deities\u2014and only then does he devote himself to\nthe compounding. The process is concluded by the consecration and the\ningestion of the elixir. It is this entire sequence, and not only the\nwork at the furnace, that constitutes the alchemical practice.\n\nThe main tool, from both a ritual and a technical point of view, is\nthe crucible. To reproduce the state of the cosmos at its inception\n(hundun; see \u00a74.3), the vessel\nshould be hermetically sealed so that the vital \u201cbreath\u201d\n(qi) is not dispersed. Under these conditions, the elixir\ningredients \u201crevert\u201d (huan) to their original\nstate. This refined matter is equated with the Essence (jing)\nthat is hidden within the Dao and gives birth to the world\n(\u201cVague and indistinct! Within it there is something. Dim and\nobscure! Within it there is an essence\u201d; Daode jing,\nsec. 21). The elixir therefore is a tangible sign of the seed that\ngenerates the cosmos.\n\nIngesting an elixir is said to confer, in the first place,\ntranscendence, immortality, and admission into the ranks of the\ncelestial bureaucracy. One also gains the ability of summoning\nbenevolent gods and obtains protection from demons, spirits, and\nseveral other disturbances, including weapons, wild animals, and even\nthieves. Remarkably, in order to provide these benefits, the elixir\ndoes not need to be ingested: it may simply be kept in one\u2019s\nhand or carried at the belt as a powerful apotropaic talisman.\n10.2 Alchemy and Cosmology\n\nEarly Waidan sources do not rely on the system of correlative\ncosmology. This system, instead, becomes essential in the\nlater Waidan traditions and in virtually the whole of Neidan. The\nfoundations of this new model of doctrine and practice were provided\nby the Cantong qi (Seal of the Unity of the Three),\ntraditionally said to be written in the 2nd century CE but\ndating from between the mid-5th and the mid-7th\ncentury (Pregadio 2011). Scores of texts both within and outside the\nDaoist Canon are related to this work. Although its views have been\nunderstood mainly in relation to Neidan, they also apply to\nWaidan.\n\nThe Cantong qi and its tradition use several sets of emblems\nthat represent different aspects of the relation of the cosmos to the\nDao. The main set is formed by four trigrams of the Book of\nChanges, namely Qian \u2630, Kun \u2637,\nKan \u2635, and Li \u2632, which represent the\nmodes taken on by the Dao in its self-manifestation. Qian\nstands for the active (Yang) aspect of the Dao, and Kun stands\nfor its passive (Yin) aspect. Their permanent conjunction in\nthe precosmic domain gives birth to the cosmos. The Yang of\nQian \u2630 moves into Kun \u2637, which becomes\nKan \u2635; in response, the Yin of Kun\n\u2637 moves into Qian \u2630, which becomes Li\n\u2632. In the cosmos, therefore, the Yin contains True\nYang (the inner solid line of Kan \u2635), and the\nYang contains True Yin (the inner broken line of\nLi \u2632).\n\nOn the basis of these principles, the only form of alchemical practice\nsanctioned by the Cantong qi and by the works that follow its\nsystem is the one that enables the conjunction of Qian and\nKun, or True Yang and True Yin. According\nto the Cantong qi, only True Lead and True Mercury are\n\u201cof the same kind\u201d (tonglei) as Qian and\nKun. The Yin and Yang entities that\ncontain these authentic principles are \u201cblack\nlead\u201d (i.e., native lead) and cinnabar, respectively. In the strict sense of\nthe term, alchemy therefore consists in extracting True Lead from\n\u201cblack lead\u201d and True Mercury from cinnabar, and in\njoining them to one another. This is accomplished in Waidan by using\nthe corresponding minerals and metals, and in Neidan by operating on\nvarious components of the human body\u2014both physical and\nnon-physical\u2014which are symbolically denoted by the same\nterms.\n10.3 Neidan or Internal Alchemy\n\nAlthough the Cantong qi forever changed the history of Daoist\nalchemy, by no means are all Waidan works written in the Tang period\n(7th-9th centuries) inspired by its doctrines\n(Sivin 1968; Needham 1976: 132\u201374). During this period, however,\nWaidan methods increasingly tend to mirror features of the\ncosmological system (Sivin 1976 and 1980).\n\nThe shift of focus from ritual to cosmology also paved the way for the\ndevelopment of Neidan. However, the roots of Neidan are multiple, and\nit would be reductive to see it as a mere transposition of Waidan to\nan \u201cinner\u201d plane: Neidan owes its origins to meditation\nmethods on the inner gods more than it does to Waidan (Pregadio 2005).\nTo summarize a complex phenomenon, Waidan terminology and imagery were\ncombined with concepts and emblems drawn from the cosmological system\naccording to the model of the Cantong qi, and with elements\ninherited from the early meditation practices. This necessarily caused\nthe disappearance of the inner gods themselves: incorporating them\ninto Neidan would require an impossible \u201cre-mapping\u201d of\nthe inner pantheon onto a different cosmological model. The only, but\nmajor, exception is the Red Child, the innermost deity of early Daoist\nmeditation (see\n \u00a79.1).\n When he reappears in Neidan, however, the Red Child is no longer a\ngod possessed by all human beings: he is now an image of the\n\u201cembryo\u201d generated by means of the alchemical\npractice.\n\nEspecially in its forms that integrate elements defined (or\nre-defined) by Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism, Neidan focuses its\ndiscourse and practice on xing and ming, two\ncardinal concepts in its view of the human being (Robinet 1995:\n165\u201395; Pregadio 2014). Xing denotes the \u201cinner\nnature\u201d, which is related to Spirit (shen) and pertains\nto one\u2019s \u201cheart\u201d or \u201cmind\u201d\n(xin). Neidan texts often discourse on xing by using\nBuddhist terms and expressions, such as \u201cseeing one\u2019s\nnature\u201d (jianxing), and even use the term \u201cBuddha-nature\u201d (foxing). Ming, an even more complex\nterm, is related to Breath (qi) and pertains to the\n\u201cbody\u201d (shen). The term means in the first place\nthe \u201ccommand\u201d or \u201cmandate\u201d conferred by\nHeaven, but its senses also include \u201clife\u201d,\n\u201cexistence\u201d, \u201clifespan\u201d, as well as\n\u201cdestiny\u201d. While one\u2019s xing is unborn and\nis therefore free from death, everything in the domain of\nming has a beginning and an end.\n\nAs far as we know, Neidan developed from the early 8th\ncentury onwards. Two of its main branches, which emerged between the\n12th and the 13th centuries, are traditionally\nascribed with the creation of models of self-cultivation based on the\nconcepts summarized above (Yokote 2015). The first model, associated\nwith the Nanzong (Southern Lineage), gives initial priority\nto the cultivation of one\u2019s ming (existence), gradually\nshifting to the cultivation of xing (inner nature) as the\npractice progresses. The second model, associated with the\nBeizong (Northern Lineage), emphasizes instead the\ncultivation of one\u2019s xing by means of \u201cclarity\nand quiescence\u201d (qingjing); this is also said to\ninvolve the cultivation of one\u2019s ming. Despite the\ndifferences between these two models, Neidan as a whole insists that\nboth xing and ming should be cultivated, a view\nreflected in the term \u201cconjoined cultivation of nature and\nexistence\u201d (xingming shuangxiu).\n\nIn its most widespread codification, which originates in the Southern\nLineage, the Neidan practice consists of three main stages (Despeux\n1979: 55\u201382; Robinet 1995: 147\u201364; Wang Mu 2011). Its\npurpose is to lead an adept from the postcelestial to the precelestial\ndomains through the gradual reintegration of each of the three main\ncomponents of the human being\u2014Essence, Breath, and\nSpirit\u2014into the one that precedes it, culminating in the\nreversion to the state of Non-Being (wu), or Emptiness\n(xu, kong). While this is the function of alchemy\nper se, certain authors indicate that the process of\nascent to the precelestial domain should be followed by\na new descent or return to the postcelestial domain, in\norder to merge them with one another.\n\nThe practice outlined above is often described as the generation of\n\u201ca person outside one\u2019s person\u201d (or \u201ca self\noutside oneself\u201d, shen zhi wai shen), defined as the\n\u201ctrue person\u201d (zhenshen; compare\n \u00a76.3).\n In this case, the main stages of the practice are portrayed as the\nconception, gestation, and birth of an embryo, which personifies the\npractitioner\u2019s realized state (Despeux 2016). In another view,\nthe Internal Elixir is seen as already possessed by every human being\nand as identical to one\u2019s own innate realized state. Liu Yiming\n(1734\u20131821) expresses this view by saying: \u201cAll human\nbeings have this Golden Elixir complete in themselves: it is entirely\nrealized in everybody\u201d. Other authors of Neidan texts state in\ntheir works that \u201cthe Golden Elixir is in front of your\neyes\u201d.",
