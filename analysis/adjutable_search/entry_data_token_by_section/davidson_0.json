    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nDavidson was born on March 6th, 1917, in Springfield, Massachusetts,\nUSA. He died suddenly, as a consequence of cardiac arrest following\nknee surgery, on Aug. 30, 2003, in Berkeley, California. Remaining\nboth physically and philosophically active up until his death,\nDavidson left behind several important and unfinished projects\nincluding a major book on the nature of predication. The latter volume\nwas published posthumously (see Davidson 2005b), together with two\nadditional volumes of collected essays (Davidson 2004, 2005a), under\nthe guidance of Marcia Cavell.\n\nDavidson completed his undergraduate study at Harvard, graduating in\n1939. His early interests were in literature and classics and, as an\nundergraduate, Davidson was strongly influenced by A. N. Whitehead.\nAfter starting graduate work in classical philosophy (completing a\nMaster\u2019s degree in 1941), Davidson\u2019s studies were\ninterrupted by service with the US Navy in the Mediterranean from\n1942\u201345. He continued work in classical philosophy after the\nwar, graduating from Harvard in 1949 with a dissertation on\nPlato\u2019s \u2018Philebus\u2019 (1990b). By this time, however,\nthe direction of Davidson\u2019s thinking had already, under\nQuine\u2019s influence, changed quite dramatically (the two having\nfirst met at Harvard in 1939\u201340) and he had begun to move away\nfrom the largely literary and historical concerns that had preoccupied\nhim as an undergraduate towards a more strongly analytical\napproach.\n\nWhile his first position was at Queen\u2019s College in New York,\nDavidson spent much of the early part of his career (1951\u20131967)\nat Stanford University. He subsequently held positions at Princeton\n(1967\u20131970), Rockefeller (1970\u20131976), and the University\nof Chicago (1976\u20131981). From 1981 until his death, he worked at\nthe University of California, Berkeley. Davidson was the recipient of\nseveral awards and fellowships and was a visitor at many universities\naround the world. He was married three times, to the artist Virginia\nDavidson, from whom he was divorced but with whom he had his only\nchild, then to the psychologist Nancy Hirschberg, who died in 1979,\nand finally, in 1984, to Marcia Cavell. Davidson\u2019s posthumously\npublished essays are edited by Cavell, and she was also an important\ninfluence on Davidson as well as drawing on Davidson\u2019s thinking\nin her own work (see esp. Cavell 1993). For more on Davidson\u2019s\nbiography, including reminiscences from those who knew him, see\nBaghramian 2013. The Donald Davidson papers, which include course\nnotes, professional correspondence, administrative materials, and\nacademic writings, are held in the Bancroft Library at the University\nof California, Berkeley. In the late 1990s, under the auspices of the\nCentre for Philosophy of the Natural and Social Sciences, at the\nLondon School of Economics, Davidson participated in a series of\nrecorded one-on-one conversations with many of the leading figures in\nphilosophy at the time \u2013 including, among others, Quine, Nancy\nCartwright, Richard Rorty, Peter Strawson, and Michael Dummett\n(Davidson, 1997). These recordings, now available online and\nelsewhere, provide valuable additional insight into both the style and\ncontent of Davidson\u2019s thought.\n",
