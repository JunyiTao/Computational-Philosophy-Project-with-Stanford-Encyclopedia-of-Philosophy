Kant, Hume, and the Newtonian Science of Nature\n\nIn \u00a7 36 of the Prolegomena (after he has presented his\nofficial \u201canswer to Hume\u201d in \u00a7 29) Kant addresses the\nquestion of the relationship between particular empirical laws and the\na priori principles of the understanding under the title \u201cHow is\nnature itself possible?\u201d Nature in the material sense\nis \u201cthe totality of all appearances\u201d given in space and\ntime (4, 318; 69). Nature in the formal sense is \u201cthe\ntotality of rules under which all appearances must stand if they are\nto be thought as connected in an experience\u201d (4, 318; 70). In\nanswering the question of how nature in the formal sense is possible\nKant proceeds to distinguish between \u201cempirical laws of nature,\nwhich always presuppose particular perceptions\u201d and \n\n\nthe pure or universal laws of nature, which, without having a basis in\nparticular perceptions, contain merely the conditions of their\nnecessary unification in an experience. (4, 320; 71)\n\n\nYet (as we have seen) the empirical laws owe their status as\n\u201cnecessary and universally valid\u201d to their relationship\nwith the a priori \u201cpure or universal\u201d laws (principles) of\nthe understanding. Moreover, Kant illustrates this situation with an\nexample, which (as explained in the very brief \u00a7 37) \n\n\nis to show, that laws that we discover in objects of sensible\nintuition, especially if they are cognized as necessary, are already\ntaken by us to be such as the understanding has put there, even though\nthey are otherwise similar in all respects to laws of nature that we\nattribute to experience. (4, 320; 72) \n\n\nThe example (presented in the immediately following \u00a7 38) is a\n\n\n\nphysical law of mutual attraction, extending over the whole of\nmaterial nature, whose rule is that it diminishes inversely with the\nsquare of the distances from every attracting point. (4, 321; 73) \n\n\nThus, Kant illustrates his conception of the relationship between\nparticular empirical laws and the a priori principles of the\nunderstanding with the Newtonian law of universal\n gravitation.[11]\n\nIn \u00a7 VI of the Introduction to the second edition of the\nCritique, where Kant discusses the \u201cgeneral problem of\npure reason\u201d (\u201cHow are synthetic a priori judgments\npossible?\u201d), Kant explains that \n\n\nin the solution of [this] problem there is also conceived, at the same\ntime, the possibility of the pure employment of reason in grounding\nand developing all sciences that contain a theoretical a priori\ncognition of objects, i.e., the answer to the questions: How\nis pure mathematics possible? How is pure natural science\npossible?. (B20) \n\n\nKant illustrates his contention that propositions of \u201cpure\nnatural science\u201d actually exist in a footnote (ibid.): \n\n\nOne need only attend to the various propositions that appear at the\nbeginning of proper (empirical) physics, such as those of the\npermanence of the same quantity of matter, of inertia, of the equality\nof action and reaction, and so on, in order to be soon convinced that\nthey constitute a pure (or rational) physics, which well deserves, as\na science of its own, to be isolated and established in its entire\nextent, be it narrow or wide.\n\n\nKant had just completed the latter task, in fact, in his\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, which had\nmeanwhile appeared in 1786 (following the publication of the\nProlegomena in 1783 and immediately preceding the publication\nof the second edition of the Critique in 1787). There Kant\narticulates what he calls \u201cpure natural science\u201d in four\nchapters corresponding, respectively, to the four headings of the\ntable of categories (quantity, quality, relation, and modality). In\nthe third chapter or Mechanics (corresponding to the three categories\nof relation: substance, causality, and community) Kant derives three\n\u201claws of mechanics\u201d corresponding, respectively, to the\nthree Analogies of Experience: the permanence or conservation of the\ntotal quantity of matter, the law of inertia, and the equality of\naction and reaction\u2014which Kant describes as a law of \u201cthe\ncommunication of motion\u201d (4, 544; 84). All these laws, Kant\nmakes clear, are synthetic a priori propositions, demonstrated a\npriori and \u201cdrawn from the essence of the thinking faculty\nitself\u201d (4, 472; 8).\n\nFor Kant, therefore, the laws of the Newtonian science of nature are\nof two essentially different kinds. Kant regards Newton\u2019s three\n\u201cAxioms or Laws of Motion\u201d presented at the beginning of\nthe Principia as synthetic a priori truths\u2014which Kant\nhimself attempts to demonstrate a priori in the Metaphysical\n Foundations.[12]\n By contrast, Kant does not regard the inverse-square law of universal\ngravitation, which Newton establishes by a famous \u201cdeduction\nfrom the phenomena\u201d in Book 3 of the Principia, as a\nsynthetic a priori truth\u2014and, accordingly, Kant does not attempt\nto demonstrate this law a priori in the Metaphysical\nFoundations. Nevertheless, Kant regards the synthetic a\nposteriori law of universal gravitation as \u201cnecessary and\nuniversally valid\u201d in virtue of the way in which it is\n\u201cdetermined\u201d in relation to the \u201cphenomena\u201d by\nthe synthetic a priori laws of pure natural science. And, since the\nlatter, in turn, are \u201cdetermined\u201d from the a priori\nprinciples of the understanding, the a posteriori law of universal\ngravitation is thereby \u201cdetermined\u201d in relation to actual\nperceptions \u201cin accordance with the general conditions of\n experience\u201d.[13]\n\nWe shall return to Kant\u2019s conception of Newtonian natural\nscience below, but we first want to discuss Hume\u2019s rather\ndifferent debt to Newton. Hume, like virtually everyone else in the\neighteenth century (including Kant), takes Newtonian natural science\nas his model, and, indeed, he attempts to develop his own\n\u201cscience of human nature\u201d following Newton\u2019s\nexample. Yet Hume learns a very different lesson from Newton than does\nKant, based on Newtonian inductivism rather than Newtonian\nmathematical demonstrations. Contrasting Hume and Kant on this point\ngreatly illuminates their diverging conceptions of causation and\nnecessity.\n\nTo begin with, Hume does not consider Newton\u2019s \u201cAxioms or\nLaws of Motion\u201d as a priori in any sense (in Kant\u2019s\nterminology, neither analytic nor synthetic a priori). All of these\nlaws, according to Hume, are simply \u201cfacts\u201d inductively\nderived from (constant and regular) experience. Hume considers\nNewton\u2019s second law of motion (F = ma) in the Enquiry,\nsection 4, part 1 (EHU 4.13; SBN 31): \n\n\nThus, it is a law of motion, discovered by experience, that the moment\nor force of any body in motion is in the compound ratio or proportion\nof its solid contents and its velocity \u2026 . Geometry assists us\nin the application of this law \u2026 ; but still the discovery of\nthe law itself is owing merely to experience, and all the abstract\nreasonings in the world could never lead us one step towards the\nknowledge of it.\n\n\nOne of Newton\u2019s main examples of the third law of motion is the\ncommunication of motion by impact or\n impulse.[14]\n Hume considers such communication of motion in the same section of\nthe Enquiry (EHU 4.8; SBN 28\u201329): \n\n\nWe are apt to imagine, that we could discover these effects by the\nmere operation of our reason, without experience. We fancy, that were\nwe brought, on a sudden, into this world, we would at first have\ninferred, that one billiard ball would communicate motion to another\nupon impulse; and that we needed not to have waited for the event, in\norder to pronounce with certainty concerning it. Such is the influence\nof custom, that, where it is strongest, it not only covers our natural\nignorance, but even conceals itself, and seems not to take place,\nmerely because it is found in the highest degree.\n\n\nFinally, in a footnote at the end of part 1 of section 7 (the section\nin the Enquiry devoted to the idea of necessary connection),\nHume considers the law of inertia (EHU 7.25n16; SBN 73n1): \n\n\nI need not examine at length the vis inertiae which is so\nmuch talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed to matter.\nWe find by experience, that a body at rest or in motion continues for\never in its present state, till put from it by some new cause; and\nthat a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as\nit acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a vis\ninertiae, we only mark these facts, without pretending to have\nany idea of the inert power. \n\n\n(Hume here puts the law of inertia and the communication of motion by\nimpulse together, because both are consequences of a body\u2019s\n\u201cinherent force [vis insita]\u201d or \u201cinert\nforce [vis inertiae\u201d] according to Newton\u2019s third\ndefinition preceding the Laws of\n Motion.[15])\n It is clear, therefore, that Hume views all of Newton\u2019s laws of\nmotion as inductively derived empirical propositions, which\n(deceptively) appear to be derived from reason simply because the\nconstant and regular experience on which they are in fact based is so\npervasive.\n\nWe believe that Hume\u2019s discussion of the communication of motion\nby contact or impulse shows his debt to Newton especially clearly. In\nsection 7, part 1 of the Enquiry Hume is criticizing the\ninherited ideas of necessary connection. We believe that both here and\nin section 4, part 1, where he rejects any a priori demonstration of\ncausality, Hume is centrally concerned with the conception of\nnecessary connection articulated by the mechanical natural philosophy.\nThis philosophy had taken the communication of motion by contact or\nimpulse as the paradigm of an a priori rationally intelligible causal\nconnection, to which all other instances of causal connection must be\nreduced. The reduction would take place by reducing all observable\ncausal relationships to the motions and impacts of the tiny\nmicroscopic parts of\n bodies.[16]\n\nIn the view of contemporary mechanical philosophers, especially\nHuygens and Leibniz, Newton\u2019s conception of universal\ngravitation involved an entirely unintelligible action at a distance\nacross empty space. Gravitation could only be acceptable, on their\nview, if it were explained, in turn, by vortices of intervening\ninvisible matter whose tiny microscopic particles effected the\napparent attraction of bodies via impulse. Although both Leibniz and\nHuygens accepted Newton\u2019s demonstration that the orbits of the\nsatellites of the major astronomical bodies in the solar system obey\nthe inverse-square law (the planets with respect to the sun, the moons\nof Jupiter and Saturn with respect to their planets, the earth\u2019s\nmoon with respect to the earth), they rejected Newton\u2019s\nunrestricted generalization of this law to hold between all bodies\n(and all parts of bodies) whatsoever. For them, the inverse-square law\ncould be accepted in astronomy only by taking the major bodies of the\nsolar system as each being surrounded by vortices limited to the\nfinite surrounding region of their satellites. The validity of the\ninverse-square law would thus be restricted to precisely such a finite\nregion, so that it could not be extended arbitrarily far: the moons of\nJupiter would accelerate towards Jupiter, for example, but neither\nSaturn nor the sun, for example, would experience such accelerations\ntowards\n Jupiter.[17]\n\nIn the second (1713) edition of the Principia, in response to\nthese doubts about the law of universal gravitation raised by\nmechanical philosophers, Newton adds an explicit principle of\nunrestricted inductive generalization\u2014Rule 3\u2014to a set of\n\u201cRules for the Study of Natural Philosophy\u201d at the\nbeginning of Book 3. Rule 3 states (Principia, 795): \n\n\nThose qualities of bodies that cannot be intended and remitted [i.e.\nqualities that cannot be increased and diminished] and that belong to\nall bodies on which experiments can be made should be taken as\nqualities of all bodies\n universally.[18]\n\n\n\nThen, in the explanation of this Rule, Newton depicts the hypotheses\nof the mechanical philosophy as in conflict with the method of\ninductive generalization that leads to the law of universal\ngravitation (Principia, 795\u2013796): \n\n\nFor the qualities of bodies can be known only through experiments; and\ntherefore qualities that square with experiments universally are to be\nregarded as universal qualities \u2026. Certainly idle fancies ought\nnot to be fabricated recklessly against the evidence of experiments,\nnor should we depart from the analogy of nature, since nature is\nalways simple and ever consonant with itself.\n\n\nThat the \u201cidle fancies\u201d in question include the hypotheses\nof the mechanical philosophers (such as the vortex hypothesis) is made\nperfectly clear and explicit in the passage from the General Scholium\n(also added to the second edition in 1713) where Newton famously says\nthat he \u201cfeigns\u201d no hypotheses (Principia, 943):\n\n\n\nI have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reason for\n[the] properties of gravity, and I do not feign hypotheses. For\nwhatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a\nhypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based\non occult qualities, or mechanical, have no place in experimental\nphilosophy. In this experimental philosophy, propositions are deduced\nfrom the phenomena and are made general by induction. The\nimpenetrability, mobility, and impetus of bodies, and the laws of\nmotion and the law of gravitation have been found by this\n method.[19]\n\n\n\nThus, Newton also makes it clear that gravity is (at least) as well\ngrounded by induction as the favored properties of bodies singled out\nby the mechanical philosophers (impenetrability, motion, and impetus),\nall of which have been derived inductively from phenomena (a\npoint he had earlier developed in the explanation of Rule\n 3).[20]\n\nHume (as we have seen) considers all the laws of\nmotion\u2014including the communication of motion by contact or\nimpulse\u2014as (merely) inductively derived general principles.\nAccordingly, Hume also unreservedly accepts universal gravitation and\ntakes Newton\u2019s theory to articulate a fundamental law of nature\ncompletely on a par with all other inductively established laws (EHU\n6.4; SBN 57): \n\n\nThere are some causes, which are entirely uniform and constant in\nproducing a particular effect; and no instance has ever yet been found\nof any failure or irregularity in their operation. Fire has always\nburned, and water suffocated every human creature: The production of\nmotion by impulse and gravity is an universal law, which has hitherto\nadmitted of no exception. \n\n\nFor Hume, contrary to the mechanical philosophy, there is no asymmetry\nbetween the law of universal gravitation and the laws of impact with\nrespect to their intrinsic\n intelligibility.[21]\n\nThere is an even more fundamental relationship between Hume\u2019s\nconception of the inductive method and Newton\u2019s Rule 3. In the\nexplanation of this Rule (as we have seen) Newton takes the\nsupposition that \u201cnature is always simple and ever consonant\nwith itself\u201d to license the inductive generalizations made in\naccordance with the Rule. Similarly, Hume appeals, in the\nEnquiry, to the supposition that \u201cthe course of\nnature\u201d does not change (EHU 4.21; SBN 37\u201338) or,\nequivalently, that \u201cthe future will be conformable to the\npast\u201d (EHU 4.19; SBN 35\u201336). In the Treatise Hume\nformulates this supposition as the \n\n\nprinciple, that instances, of which we have had no experience,\nmust resemble those, of which we have had experience, and that the\ncourse of nature continues always uniformly the same. (T 1.3.6.4;\nSBN 89) \n\n\nHume takes this supposition to license (in his own words, to provide\nthe \u201cfoundation\u201d for: compare\n note 5\n above) all inductive inferences from observed constant conjunctions,\njust as Newton takes the supposition that \u201cnature is always\nsimple and ever consonant with itself\u201d to license the\napplications of his Rule 3. It appears very likely, therefore, that\nHume takes this Newtonian supposition as the model for his own\nprinciple of the uniformity of\n nature.[22]\n\nYet Hume raises radical skeptical doubts about this very principle. It\nhas no foundation in reasoning: neither in demonstrative reasoning nor\n(on pain of circularity) in inductive reasoning itself. Nevertheless,\nas firmly based in custom or habit, it is a universal principle of the\nhuman mind. Moreover, it is also the foundation for the best available\nscience of matters of fact\u2014Newtonian inductive science\u2014and\nfor Hume\u2019s own inductive science (self-consciously following\nNewton) of human\n nature.[23]\n Thus, when Hume sets his radical skeptical doubts aside, the\napplication of our foremost empirical scientific method (based on\nuniform constant conjunction) has normative force, and it thereby\nleads to the articulation of universal, exceptionless laws of nature\nwhich, as such, we are compelled to treat as necessary until\nexperience teaches us otherwise (in accordance with Newton\u2019s\nRule 4 in Book 3 of the Principia: see\n note 19\n above).[24] It is because the idea of necessary\nconnection, for Hume, arises from the application of the Newtonian\ninductive method that our projection of an inner feeling of\ndetermination onto nature does not merely reduce to a blind\ninstinctual disposition, but amounts to a normative methodological\nstandard in our best scientific understanding of\n nature.[25]\n\nIn the famous hypothesis non fingo passage from the General\nScholium Newton characterizes his \u201cexperimental\u201d method as\nfollows (Principia, 943): \u201cIn this experimental\nphilosophy, propositions are deduced from the phenomena and are made\ngeneral by induction\u201d. Hume focusses exclusively on the second,\ninductive, clause, and he thereby shows an especially deep insight\ninto the fundamental difference between Newton\u2019s methodology and\nthe purely demonstrative ideal of scientific knowledge represented by\nthe mechanical\n philosophy.[26]\n For Kant, by contrast, the dispute between Newton and the mechanical\nphilosophers is now effectively over; and Kant concentrates instead on\nNewtonian mathematical demonstrations and the idea of \u201cdeduction\nfrom phenomena\u201d. This comes out especially clearly in the\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science, where Kant\nengages with some of the most important details of Newton\u2019s\ndemonstration of the law of universal gravitation from the initial\n\u201cphenomena\u201d described at the beginning of Book 3 of the\nPrincipia. Kant shows especially deep insight into the way in\nwhich this argument is inextricably entangled, in turn, with the\nNewtonian mathematical conception of (absolute) space, time, and\nmotion; and he thereby takes special pains to frame the explicitly\ninductive steps in Newton\u2019s argument within the a priori\n\u201cspecial metaphysics\u201d of nature expounded in the\nMetaphysical\n Foundations.[27]\n\nThe \u201cphenomena\u201d with which Book 3 of the\nPrincipia begins record the observed relative motions of the\nprincipal satellites in the solar system with respect to their primary\nbodies (the planets with respect to the sun, the moons of Jupiter and\nSaturn with respect to their planets, the earth\u2019s moon with\nrespect to the earth). All of these satellites obey Kepler\u2019s\nlaws (at the time often called \u201crules\u201d) of orbital motion;\nand, appealing to his first law of motion (the law of inertia), Newton\nis able to derive purely mathematically that each of the satellites in\nquestion experiences an inverse-square acceleration directed towards\nits respective primary body. Moreover, the so-called \u201cmoon\ntest\u201d (developed in Proposition 4 of Book 3) shows that the\ninverse-square acceleration governing the moon\u2019s orbit is, when\nthe distance in question approaches the surface of the earth,\nnumerically equal to the constant acceleration of terrestrial gravity\nfiguring in Galileo\u2019s law of fall. Newton concludes (by the\nfirst and second of his Rules for the Study of Natural Philosophy)\nthat the (centripetal) force holding the moon in its orbit is the same\nforce as terrestrial gravity.\n\nThe crucial inductive steps come next. Newton generalizes the result\nof the moon test to all the other satellites in the solar system:\nthey, too, are held in their orbits by the same force of gravity\n(Proposition 5). Then (in Proposition 6) Newton concludes that all\nbodies whatsoever gravitate towards every primary body (including both\nSaturn and the sun towards Jupiter, for example); moreover, their\nweights, like those of terrestrial bodies, are proportional to their\nmasses at equal distances from the primary body in\n question.[28]\n Finally (in Proposition 7), Newton applies the third law of motion to\nthis last result to derive the law of universal gravitation itself:\nnot only do all bodies whatsoever experience inverse-square\naccelerations (proportional to mass) towards every primary body in the\nsolar system, but the primary bodies themselves experience\ninverse-square accelerations (proportional to mass) towards every\nother body (Jupiter towards its moons and all other planets, the earth\ntowards its moon and all other planets, and so\n on).[29]\n Indeed, Newton here extends this universal conclusion to the\nparts of all bodies as\n well.[30]\n\nKant accepts Newton\u2019s law of gravitation in its full universal\nform\u2014as a \n\n\nphysical law of mutual attraction, extending over the whole of\nmaterial nature, whose rule is that it diminishes inversely with the\nsquare of the distances from every attracting point.\n(Prolegomena, \u00a7 38: 4, 321; 73) \n\n\nMoreover, Kant has no qualms at all about action at a distance, and he\neven attempts to demonstrate a priori (in the Metaphysical\nFoundations) that universal gravitation, as a manifestation of\nwhat he calls the \u201coriginal\u201d or \u201cfundamental\u201d\nforce of attraction, must be conceived as an immediate action\nat a distance through empty\n space.[31]\n Kant also attempts to demonstrate his three \u201claws of\nmechanics\u201d corresponding to Newton\u2019s three laws of motion\nas synthetic a priori truths, especially the crucially important third\nlaw (the equality of action and\n reaction).[32]\n Whereas Newton had devoted considerable effort to producing\nexperimental evidence for this law (see\n note 14\n above), Kant here ventures a rare criticism of Newton for not having\nthe courage to prove it a\n priori.[33]\n Indeed, regarding this particular law as a synthetic a priori truth\nis central to Kant\u2019s reinterpretation of the Newtonian concepts\nof (absolute) space, time, and motion; for it is in virtue of his\nunderstanding of the equality of action and reaction that Kant is now\nable simply to define the center of gravity of the solar\nsystem (in which this principle necessarily holds) as an empirically\ndeterminable (provisional) surrogate for Newtonian absolute\n space.[34]\n Moreover, and for closely related reasons, Kant takes the\nuniversality of what he calls the \u201coriginal\u201d or\n\u201cfundamental\u201d force of attraction\u2014that it proceeds\nfrom every part of matter to every other part to infinity\u2014as\nanother synthetic a priori truth demonstrable in \u201cpure natural\n science\u201d.[35]\n\nGiven this foundation in \u201cpure natural science\u201d, Kant then\nreconstructs Newton\u2019s \u201cdeduction from the phenomena\u201d\nof the law of universal gravitation as follows. We begin, following\nNewton, from the observable \u201cphenomena\u201d described by\nKepler\u2019s \u201crules\u201d. These \u201cphenomena\u201d, in\nKant\u2019s terminology, are so far mere \u201cappearances\n[Erscheinungen]\u201d, which have not yet attained the\nstatus of \u201cexperience\n [Erfahrung]\u201d.[36]\n Then, again simply following Newton, we can use the law of inertia to\nderive (purely mathematically) inverse-square accelerations of their\nsatellites directed towards every primary body in the solar system.\nOnce we have done this, however, we can now, from Kant\u2019s point\nof view, frame all of Newton\u2019s explicitly inductive steps within\nthe a priori \u201cspecial metaphysics\u201d of nature developed in\nthe Metaphysical Foundations. By demonstrating a priori his\nthree \u201claws of mechanics\u201d corresponding to the three\nAnalogies of Experience, Kant establishes that Newton\u2019s three\n\u201cAxioms or Laws of Motion\u201d are synthetic a priori truths\n(compare notes\n 12\n and\n 32\n above). Further, by identifying the accelerations in question as\neffects of what Kant calls the fundamental force of attraction, it now\nfollows from Kant\u2019s \u201cspecial metaphysics\u201d of\n(material) nature that these accelerations must hold immediately\nbetween each part of matter and every other part of matter\u2014and,\naccordingly, are also directly proportional to the\n mass.[37]\n\nIn the fourth chapter or Phenomenology of the Metaphysical\nFoundations Kant connects this reconstruction of Newton\u2019s\nargument with the modal categories of possibility, actuality, and\nnecessity\u2014the very categories which (as we saw at the end of the\nsecond section above) make it possible for initially merely inductive\ngeneralizations (\u00e0 la Hume) to acquire the status of necessary\nlaws. The first stage, where we simply record the\n\u201cphenomena\u201d described by Kepler\u2019s\n\u201crules\u201d (as mere \u201cappearances\u201d:\n note 36\n above), corresponds to the category of possibility. The second stage,\nwhere we say that we here have instances of \u201ctrue\u201d (as\nopposed to merely \u201capparent\u201d) rotation by appealing to the\nlaw of inertia, corresponds to the category of\n actuality.[38]\n In the third stage, finally, we apply the equality of action and\nreaction to the true centripetal accelerations correlated with such\ntrue rotations\n (note 38\n above); and all of them, in accordance with Kant\u2019s metaphysical\n\u201cdynamical theory of matter\u201d, must now be taken as\nextending universally to infinity from each attracting point (compare\nnotes\n 35\n and\n 37\n above). The result is the law of universal gravitation, now seen as\nfalling under the category of necessity. In this way, Kant\u2019s\nreconstruction of Newton\u2019s \u201cdeduction\u201d of the law of\nuniversal gravitation from the initial Keplerian\n\u201cphenomena\u201d provides a perfect illustration of the\nthree-step procedure, described in the Postulates of Empirical\nThought, by which a mere \u201cempirical rule\u201d is transformed\ninto a \u201cnecessary and universally valid\u201d objective\n law.[39]\n",
