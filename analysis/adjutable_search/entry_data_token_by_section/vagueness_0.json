When does a fertilized egg\ndevelop into a person?\n\nThese questions are impossible to answer because they involve absolute\nborderline cases. In the vast majority of cases, the unknowability of\na borderline statement is only relative to a given means of settling\nthe issue (Sorensen 2001, chapter 1). For instance, a boy may count as\na borderline case of \u2018obese\u2019 because people cannot tell\nwhether he is obese just by looking at him. His curious mother could\ntry to settle the matter by calculating her son\u2019s body mass\nindex. The formula is to divide his weight (in kilograms) by the\nsquare of his height (in meters). If the value exceeds 30, this test\ncounts him as obese. The calculation will itself leave some borderline\ncases. The mother could then use a weight-for-height chart. These\ncharts are not entirely decisive because they do not reflect the ratio\nof fat to muscle, whether the child has large bones, and so on. The\nboy will only count as an absolute borderline case of\n\u2018obese\u2019 if no possible method of inquiry could settle\nwhether he is obese. When we reach this stage, we start to suspect\nthat our uncertainty is due to the concept of obesity rather than to\nour limited means of testing for obesity.\n\nAbsolute borderline cases are first officially targeted by Charles\nSanders Peirce\u2019s entry for \u2018vague\u2019 in the 1902\nDictionary of Philosophy and Psychology:\n\nA proposition is vague when there are possible states of things\nconcerning which it is intrinsically uncertain whether, had\nthey been contemplated by the speaker, he would have regarded them as\nexcluded or allowed by the proposition. By intrinsically uncertain we\nmean not uncertain in consequence of any ignorance of the interpreter,\nbut because the speaker\u2019s habits of language were indeterminate.\n(Peirce 1902, 748)\n\n\nPeirce connects intrinsic uncertainty with the sorites paradox:\n\u201cvagueness is an indeterminacy in the applications of an idea,\nas to how many grains of sand are required to make a heap, and the\nlike\u201d (1892, 167). In the case of relative borderline cases, the\nquestion is determinate but our means for answering it are incomplete.\nFor absolute borderline cases, there is incompleteness in the question\nitself. When a term is applied to one of its absolute borderline cases\nthe result is a statement that resists all attempts to settle whether\nit is true or false (Hu 2021). For instance, no amount of conceptual\nanalysis or empirical inquiry can establish the minimum number of\ngrains needed for a heap. Equally futile is inquiry into the\nqualitative vagueness illustrated by the decapitation riddle. An\ninventive speaker could give the appearance of settling the matter by\nstipulating that \u2018decapitate\u2019 means \u2018remove a\nhead\u2019 (as opposed to \u2018make headless\u2019 or\n\u2018remove the head\u2019). But that semantic revision would\nchange the topic to an issue that merely sounds the same as\ndecapitation. The switch in meaning might not be detected if the\ninventive speaker was misperceived as merely applying antecedent\nknowledge of decapitation.\n\nWe should expect absolute borderline cases to arise for unfamiliar\ncases. Where there is no perceived need for a decision, criteria are\nleft undeveloped. Since philosophical thought experiments often\ninvolve unfamiliar cases, there is apt to be intrinsic uncertainty. W.\nV. O. Quine was especially suspicious of the far-out hypotheticals\npopular in the literature on personal identity. He globalizes his\ndoubts about determinate answers in his thesis of radical translation:\nfor any language, there are indefinitely many, equally adequate rival\ntranslation manuals.\n\nThe indeterminacy of translation applies to one\u2019s own language.\nIntrospection will not settle whether \u2018\\(x\\) is the same person\nas \\(y\\)\u2019 means \u2018\\(x\\) has the same body as \\(y\\)\u2019\nor \u2018\\(x\\) has same memories as \\(y\\)\u2019. You have never\nencountered a case in which these two possible rules of usage diverge.\nJohn Locke imagines a prince and cobbler who awake with each\nother\u2019s memories. Is the prince now in the cobbler\u2019s bed\nor is the prince in his royal bed with errant memories? Quine sees a\ndeflating resemblance with the decapitation riddle. Either of the\nincompatible answers fits past usage. Yet Locke answers that the\nprince and cobbler have switched bodies. Materialists counter that the\nprince and cobbler have instead switched psychologies. Locke and his\nadversary should have instead shrugged their shoulders.\n\nThe Cambridge University philosophers Bertrand Russell (1923) and\nFrank Ramsey were heavily influenced by American pragmatism (Misak\n2016). Their reading of Peirce made semantic indeterminacy grow into\nan international pre-occupation among analytic philosophers. Although\nvagueness seems holistic, Peirce\u2019s definition is reductive.\n\u2018Tall\u2019 is vague by virtue of there being cases in which\nthere is no fact of the matter. A man who is 1.8 meters in height is\nneither clearly tall nor clearly non-tall. No amount of conceptual\nanalysis or empirical investigation can settle whether a 1.8 meter man\nis tall. Borderline cases are inquiry resistant.\n\nInquiry resistance recurs. For in addition to the unclarity of the\nborderline case, there is normally unclarity as to where the unclarity\nbegins. Twilight governs times that are borderline between day and\nnight. But we are equally uncertain as to when twilight begins. This\nsuggests there are borderline cases of borderline cases of\n\u2018day\u2019. Consequently, \u2018borderline case\u2019 has\nborderline cases. This higher-order vagueness seems to show that\n\u2018vague\u2019 is vague (Hu 2017). We are slow to recognize\nhigher-order vagueness because we are under a norm to assert only what\nwe know. When we discuss cases of twilight, we focus on definite cases\nof this borderline between day and night, not the marginal cases\nbetween definite day and definite twilight.\n\nThe vagueness of \u2018vague\u2019 would have two destructive\nconsequences. First, Gottlob Frege could no longer coherently\ncharacterize vague predicates as incoherent. For this attribution of\nincoherence uses \u2018vague\u2019. Frege\u2019s ideal of precision\nis itself vague because \u2018precise\u2019 is the complement of\n\u2018vague\u2019. Second, the vagueness of \u2018vague\u2019\ndooms efforts to avoid a sharp line between true and false with a\nbuffer zone that is neither true nor false. If the line is not drawn\nbetween the true and the false, then it will be between the true and\nthe intermediate state. Any finite number of intermediates just delays\nthe inevitable.\n\nSeveral philosophers repudiate higher-order vagueness as an illusion\n(Wright 2021, chapter 5). They deny that there is an open-ended\niteration of borderline status. They find it telling that speakers do\nnot go around talking about borderline borderline cases and borderline\nborderline borderline cases and so forth (Raffman 2005, 23). Defenders\nof higher-order vagueness reply that ordinary speakers avoid iterating\n\u2018borderline\u2019 for the same reason they avoid iterating\n\u2018million\u2019 or \u2018know\u2019. The iterations are\nconfusing but perfectly meaningful. \u2018Borderline\u2019 behaves\njust like a vague predicate. For instance, \u2018borderline\u2019\ncan be embedded in a sorites argument. Defenders of higher-order\nvagueness have also tried to clinch the case with particular-specimens\nsuch as borderline hermaphrodites (reasoning that these individuals\nare borderline borderline males) (Sorensen 2010).\n\nSecond thoughts about higher-order vagueness are difficult to sustain\nunless one also rethinks first-order vagueness. Perhaps Peirce\noverreacted to the threat of futile inquiry! Where does the tail of a\nsnake begin? When posed as a rhetorical question, the speaker\nintimates that there is no definite answer. But the tail can be\nlocated by tracing down from the snake\u2019s rib cage. A false\nattribution of indeterminacy will lead to the premature abandonment of\ninquiry. Is heat the absence of cold or cold the absence of heat? Many\nphysicists ceased to inquire after Ernst Mach ridiculed the ancient\nriddle as indeterminate. Israel Scheffler (1979, 77\u201378) draws a\nmoral from such hasty desertions. Never give up! In an internal\ncriticism of his colleague Quine, Scheffler condemns any attribution\nof semantic indeterminacy as a defeatist relic of the distinction\nbetween analytic and synthetic statements. Appeals to meaning never\nconclude inquiry or preclude inquiry.\n\nNo one pursues the many lines of inquiry Scheffler refuses to close.\nYet some agree that the attribution of borderline status is never\nmandatory. Crispin Wright (2021) concludes there are no\ndefinite borderline cases. Diana Raffman (2014, 153) offers\nsome empirical support for borderline status always being optional. A\nminority of fluent speakers will draw a sharp line between yellow and\norange.\n\nMandatory status is defended by listing paradigm cases of\n\u2018borderline\u2019. Just as a language teacher tests for\ncompetence by having students distinguish clear positives from clear\nnegatives, she also tests by their recognition of borderline cases.\nAny pupil who uses \u2018-ish\u2019 without recognizing borderline\ncases of \u2018noonish\u2019 has not yet mastered the suffix.\n\u2018Noonish\u2019 is not a synonym of \u2018within ten minutes of\nnoon\u2019 or any other term with a precisely delimited interval.\n",
