    "main_text": "Biographical Background\n1. Biographical Background\n\n\nThe setting of Buber\u2019s early childhood was late-nineteenth-century Vienna, then still the\ncosmopolitan capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a multiethnic\nconglomerate whose eventual demise (in the First World War) effectively\nended the millennial rule of Catholic princes in Europe.\nFin-de-si\u00e8cle Vienna was the home of light opera and\nheavy neo-romantic music, French-style boulevard comedy and social\nrealism, sexual repression and deviance, political intrigue and vibrant\njournalism, a cultural cauldron aptly captured in Robert Musil\u2019s\nThe Man Without Qualities (Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften,\n1930\u20131932).\n\n\nBuber\u2019s parents, Carl Buber and Elise n\u00e9e Wurgast, separated\nwhen Martin was four years old. For the next ten years, he lived with\nhis paternal grandparents, Solomon and Adele Buber, in Lemberg (now:\nLviv/Ukraine) who were part of what one might call the landed Jewish\naristocracy. Solomon, a \u201cmaster of the old Haskala\u201d \n(\u201c[ein] \u2026 Meister der alten Haskala\u201d; \nBuber 1906b, Dedication) who called himself \n\u201ca Pole of the Mosaic persuasion\u201d\n(Friedman [1981] p. 11), produced the first modern editions of rabbinic\nmidrash literature yet was also greatly respected in the traditional\nJewish community. His reputation opened the doors for Martin when he\nbegan to show interest in Zionism and Hasidic literature. The wealth of\nhis grandparents was built on the Galician estate managed by Adele and\nenhanced by Solomon through mining, banking, and commerce. It provided\nMartin with financial security until the German occupation of Poland in\n1939, when their estate was expropriated. Home-schooled and pampered by\nhis grandmother, Buber was a bookish aesthete with few friends his age,\nwhose major diversion was the play of the imagination. He easily\nabsorbed local languages (Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, German) and acquired\nothers (Greek, Latin, French, Italian, English). German was the\ndominant language at home, while the language of instruction at the\nFranz Joseph Gymnasium was Polish. This multilingualism nourished\nBuber\u2019s life-long interest in language.\n\n\nAmong the young Buber\u2019s first publications are essays on, and\ntranslations into Polish of, the poetry of Arthur Schnitzler and Hugo\nvon Hofmannsthal. Buber\u2019s literary voice may be best understood as\nprobingly personal while seeking communication with others, forging a\npath between East and West, Judaism and Humanism, national\nparticularity and universal spirit. His deliberate and perhaps somewhat\nprecious diction was nourished by the contrasts between the German\nclassics he read at home and the fervently religious to mildly secular\nGalician Jewish jargon he encountered on the outside. Reentering the\nurban society of Vienna, Buber encountered a world brimming with\nAustrian imperial tradition as well as Germanic pragmatism, where\nradical new approaches to psychology and philosophy were being\ndeveloped. This was a place where solutions to the burning social and\npolitical issues of city, nation, and empire were often expressed\nin grandly theatrical oratory (Karl Lueger) and in the aestheticizing\nrhetoric of self-inscenation (Theodor Herzl). As a student of art\nhistory, German literature, and psychology in Vienna, Leipzig,\nZ\u00fcrich, and Berlin, Buber made himself at home in a bohemian world\nof letters.\n\n\nFrom 1900 to 1916, Buber and his life-partner, the author Paula\nWinkler (1877\u20131958; pen-name: Georg Munk), moved to Berlin where they\nbefriended the anarchist Gustav Landauer (1870\u20131919) and attended the\nsalon of the Hart brothers, an epicenter of Jugendstil\naesthetics. Early on in this period Buber was active in the Zionist\nmovement of Theodor Herzl, who recruited him as the editor of his\njournal Die Welt. In 1904, the year Herzl died, Buber finished\nhis dissertation on the problem of individuation in Nicholas of Cusa\nand Jakob Boehme and he took a position as literary editor for Ruetten\n& Loening, a publishing house whose mid-nineteenth century Jewish\nfounders (Rindskopf and L\u00f6wental) had made a fortune with the\nperennially best-selling Struwwelpeter, a politically\nincorrect book of drawings about ill-behaved children (Wurm, 1994). At\nthe beginning of the century, the publisher was looking to move beyond\nthe gilded editions of Goethe and Schiller that they were publishing at the\ntime. Buber became their agent of modernization. One of the first books\nBuber placed here was his retelling of the stories of Rabbi Nachman,\none of the great figures of Eastern European Hasidism. The flagship\npublication edited by Buber was an ambitious forty-volume series of\nsocial studies, titled Die Gesellschaft, that appeared between\n1906 and 1912. As editor, Buber recruited and corresponded with many of the leading minds of his time.\n\n\nIn 1916, Martin and Paula moved to Heppenheim/Bergstrasse, half-way\nbetween Frankfurt/Main and Heidelberg. At that time, his friend Gustav\nLandauer severely criticized Buber\u2019s enthusiasm for the salutary\neffect that, as Buber saw it, the war was having on a hitherto\nfragmented society (Gesellschaft), transforming it into a\nnational community (Gemeinschaft). Buber later claimed that it\nwas at this time that he began to draft the book that was to become\nI and Thou. In Frankfurt, Buber met Franz Rosenzweig\n(1886\u20131929) with whom he was to develop a close intellectual\ncompanionship. In the early nineteen twenties, Rosenzweig recruited\nBuber as a lecturer for his unaffiliated (\u201cfree\u201d) Jewish\nadult education center (Freies j\u00fcdisches Lehrhaus) and he\nmanaged Buber\u2019s appointment as university lecturer in Jewish\nreligious studies and ethics, a position endowed by a Jewish community\nthat initially opposed Buber as too radical. Rosenzweig also became\nBuber\u2019s chief collaborator in the project, initiated by the young\nChristian publisher Lambert Schneider, to produce a new translation of\nthe Bible into German, a project he continued after Rosenzweig\u2019s\ndeath. Dismissed by the Nazis from the university in 1933, Buber served\nas the architect of German Jewish teacher re-education through the\nso-called Mittelstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische\nErwachsenenbildung (Simon, 1959). In 1937 Buber received a\nlong-coveted call to teach at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem (officially founded in 1925), an institution whose creation he had promoted since 1902 and that he \nrepresented as a member of its board of overseers. In Jerusalem, Buber\nreturned to the field of social philosophy, an academic appointment the\nuniversity administration wrested from a faculty that deemed the\n\u201cSchriftsteller Dr. Martin Buber\u201d neither a genuine scholar of religion nor sufficiently educated as a specialist in Jewish\nstudies. World-famous in his later years, Buber traveled and lectured\nextensively in Europe and the United States.\n\n\nBuber\u2019s wide range of interests, his literary abilities, and the\ngeneral appeal of his philosophical orientation are reflected in the\nfar-flung correspondence he conducted over the course of his long\nlife.  As the editor of Die Gesellschaft, Buber corresponded\nwith Georg Simmel, Franz Oppenheimer, Ellen Key, Lou\nAndreas-Salom\u00e9, Werner Sombart, and many other academics and\nintellectuals. Among the poets of his time with whom he exchanged\nletters were Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Hermann Hesse, and Stefan\nZweig. He was particularly close to the socialist and Zionist novelist\nArnold Zweig. With poet Chaim Nachman Bialik and the later Nobel\nlaureate Sh. Y. Agnon Buber shared a deep interest in the revival of\nHebrew literature. He published the works of the Jewish Nietzschean\nstory-teller Micha Josef Berdiczewsky. He was a major inspiration to\nthe young Zionist cadre of Prague Jews (Hugo Bergmann, Max Brod,\nRobert Weltsch), and the Jewish\nadult education system he organized under the Nazis inadvertently provided a last bastion\nfor the free exchange of ideas for non-Jews as well. Buber\u2019s name is\nintimately linked with that of Franz Rosenzweig and his circle (Eugen\nRosenstock-Huessy, Hans Ehrenberg, Rudolf Ehrenberg, Viktor von\nWeizs\u00e4cker, Ernst Michel, etc.), an association that manifested\nitself, among others, in the journal Die Kreatur\n(1926\u201329). The journal Der Jude, founded and edited by\nBuber from 1916 until 1924, and several editions of his speeches on\nJudaism made Buber a central figure of the Jewish cultural\nrenaissance of the early twentieth century.  Buber\u2019s work awakened\nmany young intellectuals from highly assimilated families, such as Ernst Simon, to the possibility of embracing Judaism as a living faith. Others, among them Franz Rosenzweig, Gershom Scholem, and Leo Strauss, developed their scholarly and philosophical agendas in critical appreciation of Buber without giving in to the seductions of \u201cBuberism.\u201d Buber\ncounted among his friends and admirers Christian theologians such as\nKarl Heim, Friedrich Gogarten, Albert Schweitzer, and Leonard\nRagaz. His philosophy of dialogue entered into the discourse of\npsychoanalysis through the work of Hans Tr\u00fcb, and is today among\nthe most popular approaches to educational theory in German-language\nstudies of pedagogy.\n",
