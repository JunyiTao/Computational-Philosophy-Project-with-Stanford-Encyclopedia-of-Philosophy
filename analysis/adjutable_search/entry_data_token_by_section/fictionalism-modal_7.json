    "main_text": "Technical Problems || The Brock/Rosen Objection\n3.1 The Brock/Rosen Objection\n\nThe reader is advised to consult Brock 1993 and Rosen 1993 for an\nexact statement of their objections, but in essence the problem arises\nwhen we consider the modal status of certain claims about possible\nworlds themselves. One of the principal fictionalist biconditionals,\nas we have seen, is the biconditional connecting necessary truths and\nwhat the fiction asserts about all possible worlds:\n\nNecessarily P iff, according to the modal fiction, at all\nworlds, P*,\n\n\nwhere P* is the possible-worlds paraphrase of P.\nAccording to the fiction employed by Rosen 1990 (i.e. the theory which\nDavid Lewis offers as fact), there are many co-existing concrete\npossible worlds \u2014 each one its own cosmos. Furthermore, this\nclaim is true at any of these possible worlds. So, according to the\nmodal fiction, at all worlds it is true that there are many other\npossible worlds. However, it follows from the biconditional that\nsince, according to the modal fiction, at all worlds, there are many\npossible worlds, it follows that necessarily, there are many possible\nworlds. Since necessarily P implies P, it follows\nthat there are (literally!) many possible worlds. But the whole point\nof modal fictionalism was to deny (or at least avoid asserting) that\nthere were many possible worlds. So modal fictionalism, at least of\nthe variety described, is self-refuting.\n\nSo the objection goes. (The version presented above is Brock\u2019s\nfrom Brock 1993 \u2014 for some of the detail of Rosen\u2019s\nargument, see below or Rosen 1993.) Two direct responses have been\noffered to this problem in the literature. The first, by Peter Menzies\nand Philip Pettit (Menzies and Pettit 1994), conceded that the\nobjection \u201cis decisive against the letter of the Rosen\nproposal\u201d (p. 29), and sought to provide modified fictionalist\nbiconditionals to produce a modal fictionalist theory which would not\nbe susceptible to the Brock/Rosen objection. Nolan and\nO\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1996 produced a version of the Brock/Rosen\nobjection which they believed circumvented the Menzies and Pettit\nsolution offered in section 3 of Menzies and Pettit\u2019s paper.\nSection 5 of Menzies and Pettit gave another translation scheme meant\nto avoid the Brock/Rosen objection; it is argued in the following\nsupplementary document that this scheme too is unsatisfactory.\n\n [A Persisting Problem For Fictionalism About Possible Worlds]\n \n\nI shall not dwell on the details of the Menzies/Pettit position, since\nthe other response to the Brock/Rosen objection has been more\ninfluential: the response of Noonan 1994. Noonan claims that the\nBrock/Rosen objection is not even successful against the letter of the\noriginal proposal in Rosen 1990 (Noonan 1994, p. 133). He argues that\ncareful attention to the procedures actually given by Lewis (Lewis\n1968) for paraphrasing modal claims into claims in the language of\npossible worlds will show that \u201caccording to the fiction of\npossible worlds, at any world, there are many worlds\u201d will not\nbe able to be derived, and so the move to \u201cnecessarily, there\nare many worlds\u201d cannot be carried through. Thus if\nfictionalists stick closely to the possible-worlds\n\u201ctranslations\u201d given in Lewis 1968, they will be able to\navoid the threatened collapse.\n\nThe way the Brock/Rosen objection is raised by Rosen begins with an\napparently harmless statement of contingency: (numbering of claims are\nRosen\u2019s, and while Brock and Rosen\u2019s presentations are\nreasonably informal, the formal translations are given by Noonan, and\nhis numberings for those are provided)\n\n(2) Necessarily, it is contingent whether kangaroos exist\n\n\nor to put it in formal modal logic (Kx = x is a\nkangaroo):\n\n\u25a1 (\u25ca\u2203xKx & \u25ca\u00ac\u2203xKx)\n\n\nFrom this, Rosen claims, the \u201cstandard analysis\u201d\ndelivers:\n\n(3) At all worlds, there are worlds where kangaroos exist and worlds\nwhere they don\u2019t.\n\n\nIgnoring for our purposes the complications which need to be\nintroduced if we are to add accessibility relations between worlds,\nthe Lewis 1968 equivalent of (2) is\n\n(3L) \u2200w(Ww\u2192\n\u2203w\u2032(Ww\u2032 &\n\u2203x(Ixw\u2032 & Kx)) &\n\u2203w\u2033(Ww\u2033 &\n\u00ac\u2203x(Ixw\u2033 & Kx))))\n\n\nNoonan points out that this formula does not imply\n\n(4L) \u2200w(Ww\u2192\n\u2203w\u2032(Ww\u2032 &\nIw\u2032w &\n\u2203w\u2033(Ww\u2033 &\nIw\u2033w &\n\u00acw\u2032=w\u2033)))\n\n\nwhich is the formula required in Lewis 1968 to be able to move back to\n\u201cnecessarily, there are two worlds\u201d, and which is the\nformula Brock and Rosen would need to derive if they were to show that\nRosen\u2019s (2) (or Brock\u2019s equivalent) led the modal\nfictionalist to have to say that there are literally several worlds.\nThe reason why (3L) does not imply (4L) is that it is not enough for\nthere to be two worlds at a given world (V, let us call it)\nthat there be existential quantification over two worlds within the\nscope of an existential quantifier committing us to V: the\ntwo worlds must also be \u201cin\u201d V, in the sense that\nthe two place predicate \u201cI\u201d must hold between\nV and each of the worlds. This is what happens in (4L), but\nit does not happen in (3L), where there are two existential\nquantifiers over worlds in the scope of the outside universal\nquantifier, but where the worlds existentially quantified over are not\nasserted to be \u201cin\u201d any of the worlds w.\n\nRosen 1995 has accepted Noonan\u2019s resolution of the problem\napparently posed by the Brock/Rosen objection. Rosen has thus changed\nhis preferred proposal, so that instead of a general endorsement of\nthe position outlined by Lewis 1986, Rosen\u2019s recommendation for\nmodal fictionalists now relies more heavily on Lewis 1968. Instead of\nthe simpler biconditionals discussed near the beginning of this entry\nand in Rosen 1990, the revised proposal is to take equivalences\nasserted by Lewis 1968 between modal claims and claims couched in\nterms of quantification over possible worlds, and treat those\nequivalences instead as specifying connections between modal\nstatements and claims about what is true according to the fiction. If\na modal claim is literally true, its associated world-claim is true\naccording to the fiction, and vice versa.\n\nSo the state of play seems to be this: while the Brock/Rosen style\nobjection remains something for a modal fictionalist to be wary of\nwhen constructing the fiction of possible worlds, it is possible to\navoid the objection by being suitably careful about what fictionalist\nbiconditionals to employ: and if Noonan is right, strict adherence to\nthe fictionalist modification of the equivalences offered by Lewis\n1968 provides one suitable way of being careful. It is not\nuncontroversial, of course, that Noonan\u2019s strategy is the one a\nmodal fictionalist should employ: Divers 1999a and 1999b, Kim 2002 and\nDivers and Hagen 2006 argue that it is not.\n\nHow best to respond to the Brock-Rosen objection continues to be a\nmatter for debate: both Liggins 2008 and Woodward 2008 offer\nalternatives for the modal fictionalist.\n",
