    "main_text": "Forcing || Other applications of forcing\n8.1 Other applications of forcing\n\nBesides the CH, many other mathematical conjectures and problems about\nthe continuum, and other infinite mathematical objects, have been\nshown undecidable in ZFC using the forcing technique.\n\nOne important example is Suslin\u2019s Hypothesis (SH).\nCantor had shown that every linearly ordered set \\(S\\) without\nendpoints that is dense (i.e., between any two different elements of\n\\(S\\) there is another one), complete (i.e., every subset of \\(S\\)\nthat is bounded above has a supremum), and with a countable dense\nsubset is isomorphic to the real line. Suslin conjectured that this is\nstill true if one relaxes the requirement of containing a countable\ndense subset to being ccc, i.e., every collection of\npairwise-disjoint intervals is countable. In the early 1970s, Thomas\nJech produced a consistent counterexample using forcing, and Ronald\nJensen showed that a counterexample exists in \\(L\\). About the same\ntime, Robert Solovay and Stanley Tennenbaum (1971) developed and used\nfor the first time the iterated forcing technique to produce a model\nwhere the SH holds, thus showing its independence from ZFC. In order\nto make sure that the SH holds in the generic extension, one needs to\ndestroy all counterexamples, but by destroying one particular\ncounterexample one may inadvertently create new ones, and so one needs\nto force again and again; in fact one needs to go on for at least\n\\(\\omega_2\\)-many steps. This is why a forcing iteration is\nneeded.\n\nAmong other famous mathematical problems that have been shown\nundecidable in ZFC thanks to the forcing technique, especially using\niterated forcing and sometimes combined with large cardinals, we may\nmention the Measure Problem and the Borel Conjecture in measure\ntheory, Kaplansky\u2019s Conjecture on Banach algebras, and\nWhitehead\u2019s Problem in group theory.\n",
