    "main_text": "Making sense of text || Integrated methods\n5.4 Integrated methods\n\nObviously, the many forms of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic\nambiguity and underspecification enumerated in the preceding sections\ninteract with one another and with world knowledge. For example, word\nsense disambiguation, reference resolution, and metaphor interpretation\nare interdependent in the sentence\n\n(5.15) The Nebraska Supreme Court\nthrew out the chair because it deemed electrocution to be a cruel form\nof capital punishment.\n\nNote first of all that it could refer syntactically to\nthe Nebraska Supreme Court or to the chair, but\nworld knowledge rules out the possibility of a neuter-gendered chair\nmanifesting a mental attitude.  Note as well that if it is\nreplaced by he, then the chair  is\nreinterpreted as a person and becomes the referent of the pronoun; at\nthe same time, threw out is then reconstrued as a metaphor\nmeaning removed from office (with an implication of\nruthlessness).\nThus it seems essential to find a uniform framework for jointly\nresolving all forms of ambiguity and underspecification, at least to\nthe extent that their resolution impacts inference. Some frameworks\nthat have been proposed are weighted abduction, constraint\nsolving, and \n\u201cloose-speak\u201d interpretation. Weighted\nabduction (Hobbs et al. 1993) is based on the idea that the\ntask of the hearer or reader is to explain the word sequence\ncomprising a sentence by viewing the meaning of  that sentence as\na logical consequence of general and contextual knowledge along with\nsome assumptions, to be kept as \u201clightweight\u201d as possible. The\nconstraint-solving approach views syntax, semantics, pragmatics,\ncontext, and world knowledge as supplying constraints on\ninterpretations that need to be satisfied simultaneously.  Often\nconstraints are treated as defeasible, or ranked, in which case the\ngoal is to minimize constraint violations, particularly of relatively\nstrong constraints.  (There is a connection here to\nOptimality Theory in cognitive language modeling.)\nLoose-speak interpretation (Fan et al. 2009, cited previously\nin connection with nominal compound interpretation) sets aside\nsyntactic ambiguity but tries to deal with pervasive semantic\nlooseness in the meanings of nominal compounds, metonymy, and other\nlinguistic devices. It does so by expanding semantic triples (from the\npreliminary logical form) of type \u27e8Class1,\nrelation, Class2\u27e9, where the relation cannot\nproperly relate the specified classes, into longer chains containing\nthat relation and terminating at those classes. Finding such chains\ndepends on background knowledge about the relations that are possible\nin the domain of interest.\nProspects\nThe methods just mentioned have been applied in restricted tasks,\nbut have not solved the problem of comprehensive language\ninterpretation. They all face efficiency problems, and\u2014since they\nall depend on a rich base of linguistic and world knowledge\u2014the\nknowledge acquisition bottleneck. We comment on the efficiency issue\nhere, but leave the discussion of knowledge acquisition to \nsection 8.\nIn view of the speed with which people disambiguate and comprehend\nlanguage, one may surmise that these processes more closely resemble\nfitting the observed texts or utterances to familiar patterns, than\nsolving complex inference or constraint satisfaction problems. For\nexample, in a sentence such as\n\n(5.16)  He dropped the cutting board on the glass\nand it\ndidn't break,\n\n\nthe pronoun is understood to refer to the glass, even though world\nknowledge would predict that the glass broke, whereas the cutting board\ndid not. (The idea that communication focuses on the unexpected is of\nno help here, because the referent remains unchanged if we change\ndidn't break to broke.) This would be expected if\nthe interpretive\nprocess simply found a match between the concept of a fragile object\nbreaking and the glass breaking (regardless of the exact logical\nstructure), and used that match in choosing a referent. The\nprocessing of the example from Winograd,\n in section 5.1, concerning\nrefusal of a parade permit to a group of women, may similarly depend in\npart on the familiarity of the idea that people who (seek to) parade\nmay advocate some cause. Note that in\n\n(5.17) The city council granted the women a\nparade permit\nbecause they did not advocate\nviolence\n\n\n\nthe women are still preferred as the referent of they, even though it\nis generally true that stalwarts of society, such as city councillors,\ndo not advocate violence.\nIf disambiguation and (at least preliminary) interpretation  in\nlanguage understanding turn out to be processes guided more by learned\npatterns than by formalized knowledge, then methods similar to those\nused in feature-based statistical NLP may be applicable to their\neffective mechanization.\n",
