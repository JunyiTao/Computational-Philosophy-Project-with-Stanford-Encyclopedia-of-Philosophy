    "main_text": "Diogenes of Apollonia and the Sophists\n10. The Presocratic Legacy\n\nThe range of Presocratic thought shows that the first philosophers\nwere not merely physicists (although they were certainly that). Their\ninterests extended to religious and ethical thought, the nature of\nperception and understanding, mathematics, meteorology, the nature of\nexplanation, and the roles of matter, form, causal mechanisms, and\nstructure in the world. Almost all the Presocratics seemed to have\nsomething to say about embryology, and fragments of Diogenes and\nEmpedocles show a keen interest in the structures of the body; the\noverlap between ancient philosophy and ancient medicine is of growing\ninterest to scholars of early Greek thought (Longrigg 1963, van der\nEijk 2008). Recent discoveries, such as the Derveni Papyrus, show that\ninterest in and knowledge of the early philosophers was not\nnecessarily limited to a small audience of rationalistic\nintellectuals. They passed on many of what later became the basic\nconcerns of philosophy to Plato and Aristotle, and ultimately to the\nwhole tradition of Western philosophical thought.\n",
