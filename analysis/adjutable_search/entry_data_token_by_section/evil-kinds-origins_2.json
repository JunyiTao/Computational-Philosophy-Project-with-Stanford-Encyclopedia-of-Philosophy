Kinds of Evil: Metaphysical and Empirical\n\nThe first key distinction is concerned with the kinds of\nevil\u2014with what evil is or consists in, and thus with where and\nhow it manifests. Again, the distinction is not exclusive: someone\nmight hold that there is both metaphysical evil and empirical\nevil, and that the latter is typically a manifestation of metaphysical\nevil. Someone else, however, might hold that there is no such thing as\nmetaphysical evil, and that all evils can be accounted for at the\nempirical, causal level.\n",
