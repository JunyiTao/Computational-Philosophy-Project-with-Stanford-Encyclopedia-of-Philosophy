    "main_text": "Mathematics || The natural numbers\n3.3 The natural numbers\n\nThe existence of the natural numbers is given by the first act of\nintuitionism, that is by the perception of the movement of time and\nthe falling apart of a life moment into two distinct things: what was,\n1, and what is together with what was, 2, and from there to 3, 4, \u2026\nIn contrast to classical mathematics, in intuitionism all infinity is\nconsidered to be potential infinity. In particular this is the case\nfor the infinity of the natural numbers. Therefore statements that\nquantify over this set have to be treated with caution. On the other\nhand, the principle of induction is fully acceptable from an\nintuitionistic point of view.\n\nBecause of the finiteness of a natural number in contrast to, for\nexample, a real number, many arithmetical statements of a finite\nnature that are true in classical mathematics are so in intuitionism\nas well. For example, in intuitionism every natural number has a prime\nfactorization; there exist computably enumerable sets that are not\ncomputable; \\((A \\vee \\neg A)\\) holds for all quantifier free\nstatements \\(A\\). For more complex statements, such as van der\nWaerden\u2019s theorem or Kruskal\u2019s theorem, intuitionistic\nvalidity is not so straightforward. In fact, the intuitionistic proofs\nof both statements are complex and deviate from the classical proofs\n(Coquand 1995, Veldman 2004).\n\nThus in the context of the natural numbers, intuitionism and classical\nmathematics have a lot in common. It is only when other infinite sets\nsuch as the real numbers are considered that intuitionism starts to\ndiffer more dramatically from classical mathematics, and from most\nother forms of constructivism as well.\n",
