Deflationists\ntypically note that the truth predicate provides us with a convenient\ndevice of disquotation. Such a device allows us to make some\nuseful claims which we could not formulate otherwise, such as the\nblind ascription \u2018The next thing that Bill says will be\ntrue\u2019. (For more on blind ascriptions and their relation to\ndeflationism, see Azzouni, 2001.) A predicate obeying the Tarski\nbiconditionals can also be used to express what would otherwise be\n(potentially) infinite conjunctions or disjunctions, such as the\nnotorious statement of Papal infallibility put \u2018Everything the\nPope says is true\u2019. (Suggestions like this are found in Leeds,\n1978 and Quine, 1970.)\n\nRecognizing these uses for a truth predicate, we might simply think of\nit as introduced into a language by stipulation. The Tarski\nbiconditionals themselves might be stipulated, as the minimalists\nenvisage. One could also construe the clauses of a recursive Tarskian\ntheory as stipulated. (There are some significant logical differences\nbetween these two options. See Halbach (1999) and Ketland (1999) for\ndiscussion.) Other deflationists, such as Beall (2005) or Field\n(1994), might prefer to focus here on rules of inference or rules of\nuse, rather than the Tarski biconditionals themselves.\n\nThere are also important connections between deflationist ideas about\ntruth and certain ideas about meaning. These are fundamental to the\ndeflationism of Field (1986; 1994), which will be discussed in section\n6.3. For an insightful critique of deflationism, see Gupta (1993).\n\nFor more on deflationism, see Azzouni (2018) and the entry on the\n deflationary theory of truth.\n",
