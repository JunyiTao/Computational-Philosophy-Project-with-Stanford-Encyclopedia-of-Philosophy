Conversational implicature\n\nConversational implicatures are, roughly, things that a hearer can\nwork out from the way something was said rather than\nwhat was said. People process conversational implicatures all\nof the time and are mostly unaware of it. For example, if someone asks\n\u201cCould you close the door?\u201d the hearer does not usually\nanswer \u201cYes\u201d, instead they perform the non-linguistic act\nof closing the door. In this case, although the speaker used a form of\nwords that is conventionally a question, the hearer can infer that the\nspeaker is making a request.\n\nGrice was the first to note this ubiquitous feature of language use\nand also the first to present a philosophical analysis. He begins by\nnoting that conversations are usually to some degree cooperative\nenterprises. He then formulates the Cooperative Principle: \u201cMake\nyour conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at\nwhich it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk\nexchange in which you are engaged\u201d (1989, 26).\n\nAt a more detailed level, he distinguishes four categories with more\nspecific maxims. The category of Quantity includes two injunctions,\none to make your contribution as informative as is required, and the\nsecond to make it no more informative than is required. The category\nof Quality is governed by a supermaxim: \u201cTry to make your\ncontribution one that is true\u201d. The category of Relation has a\nsingle maxim, \u201cBe relevant\u201d, while the final category of\nManner has a short \u201csuper\u201d maxim \u201cBe\nperspicuous\u201d which has various submaxims (1989, 27).\n\nPerhaps the first thing to note is that conversational maxims often\ncome into conflict. One party to the conversation may be caught\nbetween saying something less informative than is desired (violating\nQuantity) and saying something for which there is insufficient\nevidence (violating Quality). One example of the application of these\nprinciples given by Grice is the following exchange:\n\nI\u2019m low on gas.\nThere is a station around the corner on Main St.\n\n\nIn this situation the sentence B uttered does not logically imply that\nthe station is open. However, the remark is irrelevant unless the\nstation is open, so A can infer from the combination of Manner and\nQuality that B believes he has good evidence that the station is open.\nThus B\u2019s utterance conversationally implicates that the station\nis open. One characteristic of conversational implicatures is that\nthey can be cancelled. Thus if B adds to his remark above, \u201cbut\nI don\u2019t know whether it is open\u201d then there is no\nconversational implicature that the station is open. This contrasts\nwith logical or semantic implications which cannot be cancelled\nwithout contradiction.\n\nThe most famous application of Grice\u2019s ideas is to the debate\nabout whether the truth conditions of declarative conditional\nstatements, such as \u201cIf George is driving, he will be\nlate\u201d are accurately captured by the material conditional.\nRepresenting the sample sentences as \u2018George is driving\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) he will be late\u2019 would make the sentence true if\nit is false that George is driving or true that he will be late (or\nboth). Many writers argued that it would be inappropriate for someone\nto make the assertion if they knew that George was not driving.\nGrice\u2019s response is that to argue that in most circumstances it\nis conversationally inappropriate to make that assertion, not\nbecause it is false, but because it violates conversational\nprinciples.\n\nSymbolically, \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) should not be asserted in\ncircumstances where the speaker knows that \\(A\\) is false because the\nstatement not-\\(A\\) is true and simpler; similarly, if the speakers\nknows \\(B\\) is true, \\(B\\) is a shorter simpler statement; and if the\nspeaker knows both of those facts, then not-\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), is more\ninformative. Thus the only circumstances in which the conditional is\nappropriate is where the speaker is ignorant of the truth values of\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), but has some good reason to think that if \\(A\\) does\nprove to be true, \\(B\\) will as well. On this account, the truth\nconditions of the conditional are those of the material implication,\nbut the appropriate assertibility of a conditional tracks the\nconditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\).\n It should be noted that while this explanation of the\ncircumstances in which a conditional is asserted seems very plausible,\nthe account does not readily extend to apparent discrepancies between\nordinary language conditionals and the material conditional when the\nconditional is embedded in a larger context, e.g., \u201cMary\nbelieves that if George is driving, he will be\nlate\u201d. Mary\u2019s believing that George will be late allows\nMary to immediately form the material conditional belief George is\ndriving \\(\\rightarrow\\)\nGeorge will be late. But this is clearly not enough for a\nspeaker reporting on Mary\u2019s beliefs to assert that Mary\ntherefore believes that if George is driving then George will be\nlate. Grice\u2019s explanation cannot say why.\n\nIn the last two decades, there has been a burgeoning number of\nresearchers investigating conversational implicature and Grice\u2019s\nprinciples. Criticisms have come from two opposing directions. Some\ncritics argue that Grice\u2019s maxims are not sufficiently worked\nout to explain many of the phenomena related to implicature. For\nexample, in the sentence, \u201cJoan believes that some of her\nstudents will fail,\u201d there seems to be an implicature that not\nall of her students will fail, even though the contained sentence is\nnot asserted. In another direction, Wilson and Sperber, and separately\nBardzokas, argue that Grice\u2019s principles can be derived from\nmore general principles and should be understood in the context of\nsome version of relevance theory.\n\nAnother continuing topic generated by Grice\u2019s ideas is the\nrelation between semantics and pragmatics\n (see the entry on pragmatics).\n The nature of the distinction is controversial, as argued by Bach\n1997 and Horn 2006. Korta & Perry 2011 (Ch. 11) points out that there are\nvarious theoretical meanings to \u201cproposition\u201d and that the\nextent to which pragmatic principles are needed to determine the\nproposition expressed by an utterance depends on which understanding\nof proposition is in play. Two examples of the ongoing debate are\nLePore and Stone 2015 which argues that most, or perhaps all, of what Grice\nthought as pragmatic is in fact governed by linguistic rules, and\nRecanati 2010 which argues the contrary, that pragmatics plays a\nlarger role than is generally recognized.\n",
