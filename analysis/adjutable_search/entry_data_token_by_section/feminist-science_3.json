    "main_text": "Feminist Critique of Science || Feminist Science as the Elimination of Sexist Values\n2.1 Feminist Science as the Elimination of Sexist Values\n\nWomen entering science also absorb the culture of their disciplines\nand so their research begins with the assumptions, frameworks, and\ndominant methodology of those disciplines. If they are feminists, or\neven if they are not, they sometimes come to their work with different\ninterests and goals. These differences may be because of an awareness\nof aspects of the world that are either not of interest or invisible\nto their counterparts who are men. They may frame research through\nquestions not asked by others and see phenomena that had been\noverlooked, deemed irrelevant, or misinterpreted. They also may be\nmore likely to notice when research has been guided by assumptions\nabout the subject matter that are informed by stereotypical\nunderstandings of gender.\n\nOn the face of it, there is no reason to think that better\nimplementation of the practices of science could not correct these\nabsences or misinterpretations. One could argue that social science\nthat fails to acknowledge the fundamentally gendered nature of society\nsimply fails to be empirically adequate. However, as Judith Stacey and\nBarrie Thorne put it, \n\n\nOver time \u2026 feminists discover that many gaps were there for a\nreason, i.e., that existing paradigms systematically ignore or erase\nthe significance of women\u2019s experiences and the organization of\ngender. This discovery \u2026 leads feminists to rethink the basic\nconceptual and theoretical frameworks of their respective fields.\n(Stacey & Thorne 1985: 302) \n\n\nDoing traditional science better but with the same basic assumptions\ndoes not eliminate many of these problems.\n\nWorries about what it would mean to \u201crethink basic conceptual\nand theoretical frameworks\u201d of science were among the reasons\nthat feminist critique of science was a target of the \u201cscience\nwars\u201d of the 1990s. As philosophers, historians, and other\nsocial scientists recognized social influences on scientific research\nand the fact that scientific communities were social entities their\naccounts threatened the notion that moral, political, cultural, or\nsocial values should not play a role in the assessment of evidence,\nthe choice of methodology, or ultimately the acceptance of\ntheories\u2014the value-free ideal. While those embracing the ideal\nhad always recognized that some values\u2014epistemic or cognitive\nvalues that include, for example, the commitment to the pursuit of\ntruth, the empirical adequacy of theories, the consideration of total\nevidence\u2014do and should play a role in science, they rejected\nthat social, political, or moral values should. From the perspective\nof the value-free ideal, feminist values are precisely the sort of\nvalues that ought to be excluded.\n\nThus, we see the value-free ideal evoked in philosophical discussions\nof feminist epistemology and philosophy of science during the 1990s.\nFor example, Susan Haack describes feminist epistemology as\n\u201cincongruous on its face\u201d (Haack 1993: 32; for similar\nsentiments see Pinnick 1994). In response, feminist philosophy of\nscience during the 1990s was formulated as a defense against the\ncharge that forsaking the value-free ideal would undermine the\nobjectivity of science and result in a pernicious relativism.\n\nCritiques like Haack\u2019s and Pinnick\u2019s mischaracterized at\nleast some feminist philosophy of science and science studies from\nthis period. Not all feminists were arguing for a radical rethinking\nof science and most were committed to maintaining some notion of\nobjectivity and resisting relativism. Harding described those who\nbelieved that science was fundamentally sound and feminist goals could\nbe achieved through eliminating bias \u201cfeminist\nempiricists\u201d (Harding 1986). The view is not, prima facie,\nimplausible. Consider the cases discussed in\n section 1.2\n from economics, medicine, and political science. The idea that unpaid\ndomestic work should figure in economic analysis could be described as\ncontributing to a more empirically adequate economics. However, such\nan analysis fails to account for the lack of uptake of feminist\ncritique in the broader discipline.\n\nFor rational choice things are a bit trickier. For the agent of\nrational choice theory gender characteristics are not considered\nrelevant and so claiming that the approach is tainted by sexist values\nmight seem difficult to defend. Nonetheless a feminist empiricist (in\nHarding\u2019s original sense) response is possible. Rational choice\naccounts can fail in circumstances when gender is in fact a relevant\nfeature\u2014and so in such cases accounts that do not consider\ngender fail to be empirically adequate. Empirical adequacy requires\nthat all the significant or relevant phenomena be\naccounted for. But from the feminist perspective that requirement\nraises questions: \u201cRelevant for whom?\u201d and \u201cRelevant\nfor what end?\u201d Questions of significance and relevance suggest\nthat values are unavoidable.\n\nThis is even more clear in the medical example. The failure to\nconsider women when investigating cardiac health looks like sexist\nbias in the research. This might be seen as straightforward sexism\nresulting from considering the lives of men to be more important than\nthe lives of women. However, we need not assume such overt sexism in\norder to see values at work in this case. A more nuanced analysis\nrecognizes that on average heart disease has an earlier age of onset\nin men, striking them in the \u201cprime of life\u201d.\nConsequently, heart disease in men has a greater impact on economic\nproductivity in a society in which gender roles proscribe that men are\nin the workforce to a greater extent than women\u2014as has\nhistorically been the case in the industrialized north. The value\nplaced on the lives of (younger) men as opposed to (older) women is\nreflected in the prioritizing of research on men. The impact of heart\ndisease on the economy because it affected more men of working age\nthan women, is a reflection of the gendered structure of the economy.\nUnderstanding such priorities requires identifying how values are\nimplicit in research decisions.\n\nWhat researchers (and the society in which they are embedded) take to\nbe important, and so, what they investigate, always sits in the\nbackground. The questions that are asked, what counts as evidence, and\nultimately what counts as knowledge, is dependent on those interests.\nEliminating bias in science does not mean eliminating interests.\n\nWhile there is general agreement that science improperly informed by\nunexamined sexist assumptions is bad science, current thinking is that\nwhat makes it bad is less that it incorporates values but rather that\nthe values that it incorporates either are the wrong ones (Kourany\n2010), are used in the wrong way (Anderson 2004), or are adopted\nuncritically (Longino 1990). These differing feminist attitudes\ntowards the role of values as they appear in feminist philosophy of\nscience will be discussed in more detail in\n section 4.2.\n",
