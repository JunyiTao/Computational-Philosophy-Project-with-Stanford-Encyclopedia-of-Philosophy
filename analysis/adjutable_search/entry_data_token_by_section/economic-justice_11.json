    "main_text": "Social Choice || Arrow\u2019s Theorem\n4.1 Arrow\u2019s Theorem\n\nIn an attempt to construct a consistent social ranking of a set of\nalternatives on the basis of individual preferences over this set,\nArrow (1951) obtained: 1) an impossibility theorem; 2) a\ngeneralization of the framework of welfare economics, covering all\ncollective decisions from political democracy and committee decisions\nto market allocation; 3) an axiomatic method which set a standard of\nrigor for any future endeavor.\n\nThe impossibility theorem roughly says that there is no general way to\nrank a given set of (more than two) alternatives on the basis of (at\nleast two) individual preferences, if one wants to respect three\nconditions: (Weak Pareto) unanimous preferences are always respected\n(if everyone prefers A to B, then A is better than B); (Independence\nof Irrelevant Alternatives) any subset of two alternatives must be\nranked on the sole basis of individual preferences over this subset;\n(No-Dictatorship) no individual is a dictator in the sense that his\nstrict preferences are always obeyed by the ranking, no matter what\nthey and the other individuals\u2019 preferences are. The\nimpossibility holds when one wants to cover a great variety of\npossible profiles of individual preferences. When there is sufficient\nhomogeneity among preferences, for instance when alternatives differ\nonly in one dimension and individual preferences are based on the\ndistance of alternatives to their preferred alternative along this\ndimension (think, for instance, of political options on the left-right\nspectrum), then consistent methods exist (the majority rule, in this\nexample; Black 1958).\n\nArrow\u2019s result clearly extends the scope of analysis beyond the\ntraditional focus of welfare economics, and nicely illuminates the\ndifficulties of democratic voting procedures such as the Condorcet\nparadox (consisting of the fact that majority rule may be\nintransitive). The analysis of voting procedures is wide domain. For\nrecent surveys, see e.g. Saari (2001) and Brams and Fishburn (2002),\nas well as the entry on\n Arrow\u2019s Theorem.\n This analysis reveals a deep tension between rules based on the\nmajority principle and rules which protect minorities by taking\naccount of preferences in a more extended way (see Pattanaik\n2002).\n\nSpecialists of welfare economics once claimed that Arrow\u2019s\nresult had no bearing on economic allocation (e.g. Samuelson 1967),\nand there is some ambiguity in Arrow (1951) about whether, in an\neconomic context, the best application of the theorem is about\nindividual self-centered tastes over personal consumptions,\nin which case it is indeed relevant to welfare economics, or about\nindividual ethical values about general allocations. It is\nnow generally considered that the formal framework of social choice\ncan sensibly be applied to the Bergson-Samuelson problem of ranking\nallocations on the basis of individual tastes. Applications of\nArrow\u2019s theorem to various economic contexts have been made (see\nthe surveys by Le Breton 1997, Le Breton and Weymark 2011).\n",
