The Anthropological Side of Language Production and the Humboldtian Model of Communication; Laying the Basis of Modern Structural Linguistics\n\nBut there is yet another important facet in Humboldt\u2019s account that is\nlacking in Saussure and that Humboldt already had referred to in\nthesis 5. There he had shown the act of language production, or\nArticulation to be at one and the same time the constitutive\nact for the consciousness of self of the speaking individual. Thus\nthere arises in the act of speaking the distinction between subject\nand object as mutually constitutive correlatives of this act.\nSubsequently, in thesis 7 we learn that besides the linguistic and\nepistemological angle there is still an anthropological side to this\nprocess. For language begins simultaneously with \u201cthe first act\nof reflection\u201d, Humboldt argues, and\n\n\nprecisely when man awakens from the stupor of desire (Dumpfheit\nder Begierde), in which the subject devours the object, to\nself-consciousness, the word is there also the first impulse, as it\nwere, which man gives himself to stand still, to look around and to\norient himself.\n\n\nHis notion of the rise of human self-consciousness is therefore quite\nthe opposite of Hobbes\u2019 and particularly Hegel\u2019s view as depicted by\nthe latter in the life and death struggle of the master/slave\ndialectics in his Phenomenology of the Spirit. For Humboldt\nit is language instead that serves as the civilizing force leading the\nindividual to self-consciousness and societal interaction and thus\ninvolves a positive relation to the other. In his later linguistic\nwritings, discussed below, he developed a communicative model of human\nspeech that can be seen as an extension and transformation of the\nFichtean concept of the intersubjective \u201cI\u201d. In the\ntwentieth century the philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas attempted to\nincorporate Humboldt\u2019s model in his theory of communicative action.\n\n\nHumboldt\u2019s notion of articulation first introduced in his\n\u201cOn Thinking and Speaking\u201d of 1795 formed the theoretical\nbasis also for his empirical work into the phonemic structures of\nnatural languages where his research anticipated modern linguists\u2019,\ne.g., Trubetzkoy\u2019s and Jakobson\u2019s, conception of phonology. Already in\n1795 he drew a clear distinction between the physical sound of nature\non the one hand and the \u201carticulated\u201d sounds that\nconstitute language on the other. In his empirical studies he\ndiscovered that the latter alone would form a clearly discernible\n\u201cunit\u201d (scharf zu vernehmende Einheit), capable\nof embodying features to allow these sounds to enter into specific\nrelationships with each other and any other sound (GS Vol 7: 67). What\nthis means is that for Humboldt, the individual sound of a given\nlanguage can be formed only \u201cin relation to the others\u201d\n(in Beziehung auf die \u00fcbrigen) that make up the entire\n\u201csound system\u201d (Lautsystem) of that language (GS\nVol 7: 67). He thought it possible and desirable to set up schemata\naccounting for the different classes of phonemes\n(Buchstabenlaute) found in the world\u2019s languages, and the\ndifferent relationships into which these may enter according to their\naffinities (Verwandtschaft) or their mutual opposition\n(\u201cin Verschiedenheit einander\ngegen\u00fcberstellen\u201d GS Vol 7: 69). In working with over\na dozen native South and Central American languages, Humboldt created\none such schema enabling him to describe and to compare the phonetic\nsystems of these different\n languages.[4]\n\n",
