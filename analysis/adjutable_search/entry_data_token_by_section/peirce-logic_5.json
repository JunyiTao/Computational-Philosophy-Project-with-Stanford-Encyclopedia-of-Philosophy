    "main_text": "From Symbolic to Iconic Representation || Alpha system\n2.2 Alpha system\n\nPeirce\u2019s Alpha graphs may be drawn on a blackboard, on a\nwhiteboard, or on a sheet of paper. The basic unit is a simple\nsentence without any sentential connectives, that is, negation,\nconjunction, disjunction or conditional, etc. The following is an\nexample of a basic Alpha graph, asserting that it is sunny.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we would like to assert that it is sunny and windy, we juxtapose\ntwo basic Alpha graphs in the following way:\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make the Alpha Graph Boolean-functionally complete, all we\nneed is to represent negation. The following Alpha graph says that it\nis not the case it is sunny, by enclosing the above graph with a\ncut:\n\n\n\n\nWhen we have negation and conjunction, it is important to keep the\norder in the right way. \u201cIt is not sunny and it is not\nwindy\u201d is different from \u201cIt is not the case that it is\nsunny and windy\u201d. Hence, the sentence \u201cIt is not the case\nthat it is sunny and it is windy\u201d is ambiguous, depending on the\nscope of \u201cit is not the case\u201d. In the case of sentential\nlogic, parentheses get in to prevent this ambiguity: \\(\\neg (S \\land\nW)\\) versus \\(\\neg S \\land W\\). Peirce\u2019s warning follows:\n\n\nThe interpretation of existential graphs is endoporeutic,\nthat is proceeds inwardly; so that a nest sucks the meaning from\nwithout inwards unto its centre, as a sponge absorbs water. (Peirce\n1910a: 18, Ms 650)\n\n\nHence, the following Alpha graph should be read not as\n\u201c\\(\\neg P \\land \\neg Q\\)\u201d, but as \u201c\\(\\neg(P\n\\land \\neg Q)\\)\u201d:\n\n\n\n\nThis way of understanding Alpha Graphs is not incorrect, but has given\na wrong impression that the Alpha system is equivalent to a sentential\nsystem with two connective symbols, negation and conjunction. We all\nprefer having more connectives than these two, especially when we use\nthe language. The section explores an alternative reading of Alpha\ndiagrams, beyond negation and conjunction only, without introducing\nany new syntactic device.\n\nBelow we introduce Alpha Graphs as a formal system equipped with its\nsyntax and semantics. These tools not being available to Peirce, the\npresentation aims to show Peirce\u2019s EG is not intrinsically\ndifferent from other formal systems. At the same time, in order to\nplace Peirce\u2019s graphical systems in the traditional\nwell-developed discourse of logic, there will be an intermediate\nstage, that is, to read off Peirce\u2019s graphs into symbolic\nlanguage. This will make Peirce\u2019s graphs more accessible, and at\nthe same time support our claim that Peirce extended forms of\nrepresentations with the same scope of logic as symbolic\nrepresentation.\nSyntax\nVocabulary\n\nSentence symbols: \\(A_{1},\\) \\(A_{2},\\)\u2026\n\n\nCut\n\n\n \n\nWell-formed diagrams\n\nAn empty space is a well-formed diagram.\nA sentence symbol is a well-formed diagram.\nIf \\(D\\) is a well-formed diagram, then so is a single cut of\n\\(D\\) (we write \u201c\\([D]\\)]\u201d).\nIf \\(D_{1}\\) and \\(D_{2}\\) are well-formed diagrams, then so is\nthe juxtaposition of \\(D_{1}\\) and \\(D_{2}\\) (write \u201c\\(D_{1}\\\nD_{2}\\)\u201d).\nNothing else is a well-formed diagram.\n\n\nHere we present two equivalent reading methods for the system. The\nEndoporeutic reading algorithm, formalized based on Peirce\u2019s own\nsuggestion (as quoted above), is a traditional way to understand EG.\nAn alternative reading method, the Multiple reading algorithm, was\nmore recently presented to approach EG in a more efficient\n way.[28]\nEndoporeutic Reading Algorithm\n\nIf \\(D\\) is an empty space, then it is translated into\n\\(\\top\\).\nIf \\(D\\) is a sentence letter, say \\(A_{i}\\), then it is\ntranslated into \\(A_{i}\\).\nSuppose the translation of \\(D\\) is \\(\\alpha\\). Then, \\([D]\\) is\ntranslated into \\((\\neg \\alpha)\\).\n\n\nSuppose the translation of \\(D_{1}\\) is \\(\\alpha_{1}\\) and the\ntranslation of \\(D_{2}\\) is \\(\\alpha_{2}\\).\n\nThen, the translation of \\(D_{1}\\ D_{2}\\) is \\((\\alpha_{1} \\land\n\\alpha_{2})\\).\n\nMultiple Readings Algorithm\n\nIf \\(D\\) is an empty space, then it is translated into\n\\(\\top\\).\nIf \\(D\\) is a sentence letter, say \\(A_{i}\\), then it is\ntranslated into \\(A_{i}\\).\nSuppose the translation of \\(D\\) is \\(\\alpha\\). Then,\n\\([D]\\) is translated into \\((\\neg \\alpha)\\).\nSuppose the translation of \\(D_{1}\\) is \\(\\alpha_{1}\\)\nand the translation of \\(D_{2}\\) is \\(\\alpha_{2}\\).\n\n\nthe translation of \\(D_{1} D_{2}\\) is \\((\\alpha_{1}\n\\land \\alpha_{2})\\),\nthe translation of \\([D_{1} D_{2}]\\) is\n\\((\\neg\\alpha_{1} \\lor \\neg \\alpha_{2})\\),\nthe translation of \\([D_{1}\\ [D_{2}]]\\) is \\((\\alpha_{1}\n\\rightarrow \\alpha_{2})\\), and\nthe translation of \\([[D_{1}]\\ [D_{2}]]\\) is\n\\((\\alpha_{1} \\lor \\alpha_{2})\\).\n\n\n\nEach of these two readings has its own \n strength.[29]\n The Endopreutic\nreading assures us that the Alpha system is truth-functionally\ncomplete, since it has power to express conjunction and negation.\nHowever, this traditional method has been partly responsible for the\nfollowing two incorrect judgments about Alpha graphs: \n\n There is not much difference between the Alpha system and a\npropositional language with only two connectives, \\(\\land\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\), except that Alpha graphs have cuts instead of symbolic\nconnectives. \n When it comes down to practical use, just as we do not want to\nuse only two connectives in a language, we have no reason to adopt the\nAlpha system over propositional languages with more connectives.\n\n\nChallenging these misconceptions, the Multiple readings algorithm\nshows that Alpha diagrams do not have to be read off as a sentence\nwith \u201c\\(\\land\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\neg\\)\u201d only, but can\nbe directly read off in terms of other connectives as well. Two\nquestions may be raised: \n\n Is there a redundancy in the Multiple readings method? For\nexample, is\n clause 4(b)\n above dispensable in terms of\n clause 3\n and\n clause 4(a)?\n \n Does this new reading show that the Alpha system is just like a\npropositional language with various connectives?\n\n\nLet us answer these questions through the following example.\nExample\n\nThe following graph is translated into the following four\nformulas:\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\\(\\neg(\\neg R \\land \\neg S)\\)\nEndoporeutic Reading \n\n2.\n\\(R \\lor S\\)\n4(d)\n of Multiple Readings \n\n3.\n\\(\\neg R \\rightarrow S\\)\n3\n and\n 4(c)\n of Multiple Readings \n\n4.\n\\(\\neg\\neg R\\lor \\neg\\neg S\\)\n3\n and\n 4(b)\n of Multiple Readings \n\n\n\nThe Endoporeutic reading allows us to get the first reading only, but\nwe may obtain different sentences by the Multiple Readings. Of course,\nall of these sentences are logically equivalent. Here is an\ninteresting point: In the case of symbolic systems, we need to prove\nthe equivalence among the above sentences by using inference rules.\nBut, derivation processes are dispensable in the case of the Alpha\nsystem when the Multiple readings are\n adopted.[30]\n Hence, having the\n clause 4(b)\n above in addition to\n clause 3\n and\n clause 4(a)\n is not redundant, but instead highlights a fundamental difference\nbetween the Alpha system and a symbolic language with various\nconnectives (see Shin 2002: \u00a7\u00a74.3.2, 4.4.4, and 4.5.3).\n\nSince we have the semantics for propositional logic and our reading\nmethods translate Alpha diagrams into a propositional language, we can\nlive without the direct semantics. However, if one insists on the\ndirect semantics:\nSemantics\n\nLet \\(v\\) be a truth function such that it assigns t or f to each\nsentence letter and t to an empty space. Now, we extend this function\nto \\(\\overline{v}\\) as follows:\n\n\n\n\\(\\overline{v}(D) = v(D)\\) if \\(D\\) is a sentence symbol or an empty\nspace. \n\n\n\\(\\overline{v} ( {\\bf [}D{\\bf ]})\\) = t iff \\(\\overline{v}(D)\\) =\nf. \n\n\n\\(\\overline{v}(D_{1} D_{2})\\) = t iff \\(\\overline{v}(D_{1}) =\\)t and\n\\(\\overline{v}(D_{2})\\) = t. \n\n\nWe also would like to emphasize that this is not the only way to\napproach Peirce\u2019s EG. For example, some claim that\ngame-theoretic semantics were foreshadowed by Peirce, and thus argue\nfor a more dynamic understanding of EG from the game-theoretic point\nof view (Burch 1994; Hilpinen 1982; Hintikka 1997; Pietarinen\n2006).\n\nPeirce makes it clear his EG is a deductive system equipped with\ninference rules:\n\n\nThe System of Existential Graphs is a certain class of\ndiagrams upon which it is permitted to operate certain\ntransformations. (1903a [CP 4.414])\n\n\nThe inference rules for the Alpha system are presented as follows:\n(1903a [CP\n 4.415])[31]\n\n\nCode of Permissions\n\nPermission No. 1. In each special problem such graphs may be\nscribed on the sheet of assertion as the conditions of the special\nproblem may warrant.\nPermission No. 2. Any graph on the sheet of assertion may be\nerased, except an enclosure with its area entirely blank.\nPermission No. 3. Whatever graph it is permitted to scribe on the\nsheet of assertion, it is permitted to scribe on any unoccupied part\nof the sheet of assertion, regardless of what is already on the sheet\nof assertion.\nPermission No. 4. Any graph which is scribed on the inner area of\na double cut on the sheet of assertion may be scribed on the sheet of\nassertion.\nPermission No. 5. A double cut may be drawn on the sheet of\nassertion; and any graph that is scribed on the sheet of assertion may\nbe scribed on the inner area of any double cut on the sheet of\nassertion.\nPermission No. 6. The reverse of any transformation that would be\npermissible on the sheet of assertion is permissible on the area of\nany cut that is upon the sheet of assertion.\nPermission No. 7. Whenever we are permitted to scribe any graph we\nlike upon the sheet of assertion, we are authorized to declare that\nthe conditions of the special problem are absurd.\n\n\n\nEmphasizing the symmetry both in erasure versus insertion and in even\nversus odd number of cuts, Shin rewrote the rules (Shin 2002:\n84\u201385):\nReformulated Transformation Rules\n\n\n\nRR1: In an\n E-area,[32]\n say, area \\(a\\),\n\n\n\nwe may erase any graph, and \n\n\nwe may draw graph \\(X\\), if there is a token of \\(X\\)\n\n\n\nin the same area, i.e., area \\(a\\), or\n\n\nin the next-outer area from area \\(a\\).\n\n\n\n\nRR2: In an\n O-area,[33]\n say, area \\(a\\),\n\n\n\nwe may erase graph \\(X\\), if there is another token of\n\\(X\\)\n\n\n\nin the same area, i.e., area \\(a\\), or\n\n\nin the next-outer area from area \\(a\\), and\n\n\n\nwe may draw any graph.\n\n\n\nRR3: A double cut may be erased or drawn around any part of a\ngraph. \n\n\nFor examples of deduction sequences, refer to Roberts (1973:\n45\u201346) and Shin (2002: 91).\n",
