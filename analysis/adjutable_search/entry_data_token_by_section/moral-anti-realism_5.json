    "main_text": "Arguing For and Against Moral Anti-realism || Non-objectivism\n3.3 Non-objectivism\n\nTo deny both noncognitivism and the moral error theory suffices to\nmake one a minimal moral realist. Traditionally, however, moral\nrealism has required the acceptance of a further thesis: the\nobjectivity of morality. \u201cMoral non-objectivism\u201d denotes\nthe view that moral facts exist and are mind-dependent (in the\nrelevant sense), while \u201cmoral objectivism\u201d holds that they\nexist and are mind-independent. (Note that this taxonomy makes the two\ncontraries rather than contradictories; the error theorist and the\nnoncognitivist count as neither objectivists nor non-objectivists. The\nerror theorist may, however, be an objectivist in a different sense:\nin holding that objectivity is a feature of morality\nconceptually speaking.) Let us say that if one is a moral\ncognitivist and a moral success theorist and a moral\nobjectivist, then one is a robust\nmoral realist.\n\nYet this third condition, even more than the first two, introduces a\ngreat deal of messiness into the dialectic, and the line between the\nrealist and the anti-realist becomes obscure (and, one might think,\nless interesting). The basic problem is that there are many\nnon-equivalent ways of understanding the relation of\nmind-(in)dependence, and thus one philosopher\u2019s realism\nbecomes another philosopher\u2019s anti-realism. At least one\nphilosopher, Gideon Rosen, has expressed pessimism that the relevant\nnotion of objectivity can be sharpened to a useful philosophical\npoint:\n\nTo be sure, we do have \u201cintuitions\u201d of a sort about when\nthe rhetoric of objectivity is appropriate and when it isn\u2019t.\nBut these intuitions are fragile, and every effort I know to find the\nprinciple that underlies them collapses. We sense that there\nis a heady metaphysical thesis at stake in these debates over realism\n\u2026 [b]ut after a point, when every attempt to say just what the\nissue is has come up empty, we have no real choice but to conclude\nthat despite all the wonderful, suggestive imagery, there is\nultimately nothing in the neighborhood to discuss. (1994: 279. See\nalso Dworkin 1996.)\n\n\nAs Rosen says, metaphors to mark non-objectivism from objectivism are\neasy to come by and easy to motivate in the uninitiated. The\nobjectivist about X likens our X-oriented activity\nto astronomy, geography, or exploration; the non-objectivist likens it\nto sculpture or imaginative writing. (These are Michael\nDummett\u2019s metaphors (1978: xxv).) The objectivist sees the goal\nof our inquiries as being to \u201ccarve the beast of reality at the\njoints\u201d (as the popular paraphrase of Plato\u2019s\nPhaedrus puts it); the non-objectivist sees our inquiries as\nthe application of a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d: imposing a\nnoncompulsory conceptual framework onto an undifferentiated reality\n(to use Hilary Putnam\u2019s equally memorable image (1987: 19)). The\nobjectivist sees inquiry as a process of detection, our\njudgments aiming to reflect the extension of the truth\npredicate with respect to a certain subject; the non-objectivist sees\ninquiry as a process of projection, our judgments\ndetermining the extension of the truth predicate regarding\nthat subject.\n\nThe claim \u201cX is mind-(in)dependent\u201d is certainly\ntoo coarse-grained to do serious work in capturing these powerful\nmetaphors; it is, perhaps, better thought of as a slogan or as a piece\nof shorthand. There are two conspicuous points at which the phrase\nrequires precisification. First, we need to decide what exactly the\nword \u201cmind\u201d stands for. It can be construed strictly and\nliterally, to mean mental activity, or it can be understood\nin a more liberal manner, to include such things as conceptual\nschemes, theories, methods of proof, linguistic practices,\nconventions, sentences, institutions, culture, means of epistemic\naccess, etc. Were the moral facts to depend on any of these\nanthropocentric things, the anti-realist imagery of humans as\ninventors of morality may seem more apt than that of humans as\ndiscoverers. Second, we need to decide what kind of relation is\ndenoted by \u201c(in)dependent.\u201d Consider the following\npossibilities, any of which might form the basis of the claim that\ngoodness depends on mental activity (in this case, for\nsimplicity, Mary\u2019s attitude of approval):\n\n\nx is good iff Mary approves of x.\n\nx is good iff Mary would approve of x (in\nsuch-and-such circumstances).\n\nx is good iff x merits Mary\u2019s approval.\n\n\nThe catalog can be made longer, depending on whether the\n\u201ciff\u201d is construed as necessary or contingent, conceptual,\na priori, or a posteriori. To illustrate further the\nubiquity of and variation among mind-dependence relations on the menu\nof moral theories, consider the following:\n\nAccording to classic utilitarianism, one is obligated to act so as\nto maximize moral goodness, and moral goodness is identical to\nhappiness. Happiness is a mental phenomenon.\nAccording to Kant, one\u2019s moral obligations are determined by\nwhich maxims can be consistently willed as universal laws; moreover,\nthe only thing that is good in itself is a good will. Willing is a\nmental activity, and the will is a mental faculty.\nAccording to John Rawls (1971), fairness is determined by the\nresults of an imaginary collective decision, wherein self-interested\nagents negotiate principles of distribution behind a veil of\nignorance. Decision-making, negotiation, and agency all require mental\nactivity.\nAccording to Michael Smith (1994), the morally right action for a\nperson to perform depends in part on what advice would be given to\nthat person by her epistemically and rationally idealized counterpart.\n(See also Railton 1986.) Epistemic improvement and rational\nimprovement are mental phenomena.\nAccording to Richard Boyd (1988), moral goodness is identical to a\ncluster of properties conducive to the satisfaction of human needs,\nwhich tend to occur together and promote each other. Human needs may\nnot all be mental, but the needs that depend in no way on the\nexistence of mental activity are surely few.\nAccording to Frank Jackson (1998), ethical terms pick out\nproperties that play a certain role in the conceptual network\ndetermined by mature folk morality. \u201cThe folk\u201d necessarily\nhave minds, and the relevant process of \u201cmaturing\u201d is\npresumably one that implicates a variety of psychological events.\n\n\nIndeed, it is difficult to think of any serious version of moral\nsuccess theory for which the moral facts depend in no way on\nmental activity. Yet to conclude that the distinction between minimal\nand robust realism cannot be upheld would be premature. Many\nmetaethicists who reject noncognitivism and the error theory, and thus\ncount as minimal realists, continue to define their position (often\nunder the label \u201cconstructivism\u201d) in contrast to a realist\nview. (See Bagnoli 2002; Ronzoni 2010; Street 2010, 2012. See also the\nentry on\n constructivism in metaethics.)\n The challenge is to pick among the various mind-(in)dependence\nrelations in the hope of drawing a distinction that is philosophically\ninteresting and meshes satisfactorily with our preexisting\nphilosophical taxonomy, such that some success theorists count as\nrealists and some do not.\n\nElizabeth Tropman (2018) argues that the best way of understanding\nmoral objectivity is as follows: The fact that x is\nM (where \u201c\u2026 is M\u201d is some moral\npredicate) is objective if and only if this fact doesn\u2019t depend\nonly on any actual or hypothetical agent\u2019s (i) belief or\nnoncognitive attitude about x\u2019s being M, or\n(ii) noncognitive attitude about x. According to this view,\nmany of the aforementioned examples of moral theories, although making\nmoral facts dependent in various ways on various kinds of mental\nphenomena, will not count as non-objective. Consider, for example, the\nutilitarian view that what makes a particular action, \u03c6, morally\nobligatory is that it produces maximal happiness. According to this\nview, although some agent\u2019s (or agents\u2019) mental\nstates\u2014in this case, their happiness\u2014may contribute to\n\u03c6\u2019s moral status, they do not exclusively determine it.\nOther factors also contribute to \u03c6\u2019s moral status, such as\nhow \u03c6 compares with other potential actions in terms of happiness\nproduction,. Therefore, on Tropman\u2019s view, this form of\nutilitarianism would satisfy the requirements for morality to count as\nobjective.\n\nThe attractions of moral non-objectivism are that it ticks a lot of\nboxes that its competitors fail to tick. Unlike noncognitivism or\nerror theory, moral non-objectivism is a form of moral anti-realism\nthat allows for the existence of moral beliefs, moral facts, and moral\ntruth, and thus also potentially makes conceptual space for such\nthings as moral progress and moral knowledge. Unlike moral realism, by\nmaking the moral facts depend on us, moral non-objectivism seems to\nhave an easier time accounting for a moral ontology that is both\nnaturalistic and normative.\n\nGiven the wide variety of versions of moral non-objectivity,\nidentifying generic problems is not a straightforward task. One way of\nbringing out some potential worries is to see the non-objectivist as\nfacing a dilemma. Moral non-objectivism comes in both relativistic and\nabsolutist flavors, and either way one goes poses challenges.\n\nConsider first an absolutist version on non-objectivism. Here we would\nhave to identify some agent or group of agents whose beliefs or\nnoncognitive attitudes determine the moral facts. Reasonable\ncontenders for this role are not going to be actual particular people.\nIt would not, for example, be a reasonable theory that maintained that\nthe moral facts for everyone throughout all time are determined by\nwhat Richard Joyce thinks on the matter. (The only plausible contender\nfor this role might be God, but such a theory faces its own\narray of problems.) Rather, absolutist non-objectivists are likely to\nplump for idealized hypothetical agents. Roderick Firth (1952), for\nexample, identifies moral properties with dispositions to prompt\nresponsive attitudes in an \u201cideal observer\u201d\u2014where\nthe ideal observer is defined in terms such as omniscience,\ndisinterestedness, and dispassionateness. (Slightly confusingly for\nour purposes, Firth explicitly characterizes this theory as an\nobjectivist one, but this is because he has in mind a kind of\nexistential mind-dependence relation. The moral status of an\naction, on this view, doesn\u2019t depend on the existence of an\nideal observer\u2019s mental activity; rather, it depends on how such\nan agent counterfactually would respond. We can consider this as\nfurther evidence of the difficulties in nailing down a fixed notion of\nmoral objectivity.) A structurally similar version of\nabsolutist non-objectivism is Ronald Milo\u2019s contractarian\nconstructivism (1995), according to which the moral facts are\ndetermined by the choices that would be made by a hypothetical\nidealized group of rational contractors. (See also Scanlon 1998.)\n\nThe challenge for such theories is to explain why one should\ncare about the moral status of actions. Since the person or\ngroup that determines the moral status of my actions is not\nme, and is not even someone I\u2019ve ever met or\nnecessarily care about, then why should their hypothetical responses\nmatter to me? Any particular proposed action of mine will have an\ninfinity of dispositional properties. My proposed action of, say,\nstealing a newspaper may have the dispositional property that a\nFirthian ideal observer would disapprove of it, while simultaneously\nhaving the dispositional property that a Miloesque idealized group of\nrational contractors would choose to refrain from it. But it also has\na myriad of other dispositions to prompt responses in hypothetical\nagents: it may also be such that drunken Vikings would heartily cheer\nit, be such that zealous medieval samurai would think it dishonorable,\nbe such that Soviet communists seeking to promote the Workers\u2019\nRevolution would regard it as obligatory, and so on. The question is\nwhy I, in trying to decide how to act, should care about any of these\ndispositional properties\u2014or (perhaps more pointedly) why I\nshould care about one of them very much indeed while ignoring all the\nothers. Simply labeling one of these dispositional properties\n\u201cmoral wrongness\u201d doesn\u2019t make that property\nmatter.\n\nOne response to this challenge is to make the idealized judges, whose\nbeliefs or noncognitive states determine the moral status of\nagents\u2019 actions, versions of the agents themselves (see Carson\n1984). Perhaps I have reason to care about what I would think\nif I were, say, fully informed and had fully reflected on the matter.\nThis brings us back to the other horn of the dilemma: the relativistic\nversion on non-objectivism. The problem is that securing the practical\nsignificance of moral facts in this manner (something that the\nabsolutist version struggles to secure) comes at a price. If you and I\nare quite different people\u2014with different desires, interests,\nand goals\u2014then the idealized version of me may have a different\nresponse to a situation than the idealized version of you would have\n(see Sobel 1999). In this case, the very same action may be morally\nright relative to me and morally wrong relative to you, and\nthat\u2019s all there is to it: there would be no way for you and me\nto settle our moral disagreement. Indeed, there may not even\nbe a disagreement, since if when I say \u201cX is\nmorally right\u201d I mean \u2026 relative to idealized\nme, and when you say \u201cNo, X is not morally\nright\u201d you mean \u2026 relative to idealized you,\nthen we are not really contradicting each other. (See entry for\n moral relativism.)\n If relativistic non-objectivism makes moral disagreement disappear,\nthen it very probably also makes the notion of moral progress\ndisappear. If the moral views I held in the past were true\nrelative to me then (though false relative to me now), and my\ncurrent very different moral views are true relative to me now (but\nfalse relative to past me), then the best one could say on behalf of\nmoral progress is that there has been progress from my current\npoint of view (something that will be seen as moral deterioration\nfrom my past point of view). To the extent, then, that we do wish to\naccommodate the existence of moral disagreement and moral progress,\nrelativistic non-objectivism has some explaining to do. (Note that the\nversion of relativistic non-objectivism just discussed is\nindividual-relative, but the same problems concerning disagreement and\nmoral progress would arise if a culture-oriented version of relativism\nwere examined instead.)\n\nThe proposal that moral facts are non-objective\u2014that morality is\nsomething created, not discovered\u2014is often rejected in popular\ndiscussion because people have only crude versions of non-objectivism\nin mind, such as views that would make the moral facts for a person be\njust whatever whimsically suits them (e.g., \u201cX is\nmorally wrong\u201d = \u201cI disapprove of X\u201d). But\nno professional philosopher endorses such a view; nobody thinks that\nthe non-objectivity of morality would be like the non-objectivity of\nchoosing your favorite ice cream flavor. Serious forms of moral\nnon-objectivism are sophisticated and subtle. Still, there is a real\nworry that if the non-objectivism is too\nsophisticated\u2014especially if it looks to the responses of highly\nidealized hypothetical agents as being determinative of the moral\nfacts\u2014then the question of why, on this account, morality would\nmatter to non-idealized non-hypothetical agents comes to the\nfore.\n",
