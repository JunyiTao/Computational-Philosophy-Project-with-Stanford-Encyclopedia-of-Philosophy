    "main_text": "Social-Political Philosophy || Feminism\n3.2 Feminism\n\nIf feminism is the view that women are, and ought to be recognized as,\nmen\u2019s intellectual, moral, sexual, and political equals, then\nthe Objectivist philosophy of human nature is inherently feminist,\nsince it applies equally to all human beings, regardless of gender (or\nrace) (N. Branden 1999). Decades before it was considered acceptable\nfor women to lack \u201cmaternal instincts\u201d or pursue careers,\nRand created heroines who lack the first and pursue the second, free\nof guilt or\n self-doubt.[11]\n Kira (We the Living) wants to be an engineer, and Dagny\n(Atlas Shrugged) runs Taggart Transcontinental, the largest\nand most successful transcontinental railroad in the country. None of\nRand\u2019s heroines sacrifices her interests, intellect, or\nprinciples for the man or men in her life. One literary critic argues\nthat Dagny is the first, and perhaps only, epic heroine in Western\nliterature because of the grandness of her vision, her courage and\nintegrity, her unusual abilities, and her national importance\n(Michalson 1999). Rand\u2019s depiction of her heroines\u2019\nenjoyment of sex and their freedom from all merely conventional norms\nabout sex anticipates the sexual liberation movement of the\n20th century by at least 30 years. In all three novels, it\nis the heroine who has the power to choose which of the men who love,\nadmire, and desire her (and only her) she will have. Rand was also an\nardent champion of a woman\u2019s right to control her own\nreproductive choices (1968a, 1981).\n\nHer relationship to the feminist movement, however, was more complex.\nAlthough she praised Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine\nMystique, mainstream feminism\u2019s collectivism and emphasis\non women as victims later led her to reject feminism as such. Many\ntheorists argue that Rand\u2019s work, especially Atlas\nShrugged, upholds important feminist ideals, even as it succumbs\nto some anti-feminist tendencies that contradict her individualistic\nethics (e.g., Gladstein 1978, 1999; B. Branden 1999; Presley 1999;\nSheaffer 1999; Taylor 1999). Many others regard her and her work as\nplainly anti-feminist, with Susan Brownmiller even calling her\n\u201ca traitor to her own sex\u201d (Brownmiller 1975). One\ncriticism takes aim at the individualism of Rand\u2019s ethics and\npolitics, which rejects any special government help for women or\ndiscrimination against men (e.g., Harrison 1978). Another objects that\nRand has internalized a masculine conception of human nature and\nvirtue, and then created her ideal woman in light of this conception\n(Brownmiller 1975; Glennon 1979). This may be responsible for\nRand\u2019s puzzling (and offensive) view that the essence of\nfemininity is to hero-worship (not men, but) masculinity, while\ninsisting (as her novels depict) that women and men are inherently\nequal and that the ideal romantic relationship is between moral and\nintellectual equals (1968b; cf. Brown 1999). At least as offensive to\nmany are the violent sex scenes in her novels, especially the infamous\nscene in The Fountainhead that many regard as rape, where\nHoward Roark has sex with Dominique in spite of her resistance.\n\nThose who reject the charge of rape argue that in the 1940s and 50s,\nwhen Rand wrote her novels, it would have been seen as rough sex\nrather than non-consensual sex (McElroy 1999; Sheaffer 1999). That\nRand herself thought of this scene as consensual is shown a few pages\nlater, when she writes: \u201cThey had been united in an\nunderstanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of\nhis action\u201d (1943: 218). And in letters to disturbed readers in\n1946 and 1965, Rand denied that the scene is \u201cactual rape\u201d\nwhich, she stated, is \u201ca dreadful crime\u201d, a \u201cvicious\naction and a violation of a woman\u2019s rights\u201d (Rand 1995a).\nOn the other hand, she also depicts Dominique exultantly telling\nherself that she\u2019s been raped. McElroy wonders if having her\nheroine call it rape is just another instance of Rand\u2019s desire\nto provoke and shock the reader (McElroy 1999), as when she uses\n\u201cselfishness\u201d to mean \u201crational\nself-interest\u201d.\n",
