    "main_text": "Life and Influence\n1. Life and Influence\n\nVienna-born Alfred Schutz joined the artillery division of the\nAustrian army during World War I and served on the Italian front\nbefore returning to pursue studies at the University of Vienna. There\nSchutz studied law, social science, and business with renowned figures\nsuch as Hans Kelsen and Ludwig von Mises, but his most significant\neducational experience occurred while he was a member of the Mises\nCircle, one of many Viennese circles, of which the \u201cSchlick\nCircle\u201d was the most famous. In the interdisciplinary Mises\nCircle, Schutz formed friendships that would continue throughout the\ncataclysmic decades of the 1930s and 1940s and that included, among\nothers, economists Gottfried von Haberler, Friedrich A. von Hayek,\nFritz Machlup, Oskar Morgenstern, philosopher Felix Kaufmann, and\npolitical scientist Eric Voegelin. While continuing to pursue his\nacademic interests, in 1927 Schutz was named executive officer of\nReitler and Company, a leading Viennese banking firm with\ninternational business relations, and thus he commenced a life-long\npattern that led Edmund Husserl to describe him as \u201ca banker by\nday and a philosopher by night.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning, Schutz had been taken with the methodological\nwritings of Max Weber, who had lectured in Vienna in the summer of\n1918 and whose work was immensely popular among Viennese\nintellectuals. However, Schutz felt that Weber\u2019s work rested on\ntacit, unexamined presuppositions resulting from his lack of interest\nin fundamental epistemological problems that had no direct bearing on\nhis special sociological problems. In 1925\u20131927, Schutz turned\nto Henri Bergson\u2019s philosophy of consciousness and inner time in\norder to clarify notions such as meaning, action, and\nintersubjectivity, and his results have been collected in manuscripts\npublished as Life Forms and Meaning Structure. Dissatisfied,\nthough, with his analyses of temporality to the extent that he never\npublished them and prompted by comments of Felix Kaufmann, he\ndiscovered the relevance of the phenomenology of the consciousness of\ninner time of Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938). He then went on to\nproduce his major life\u2019s work, The Phenomenology of the\nSocial World (1932), a work for which Husserl praised him as\n\u201can earnest and profound phenomenologist.\u201d He spent the\nrest of the 1930s authoring brief essays showing how his phenomenology\nof the social world could come to terms with the economic thought of\nMises and Hayek. Also, before any direct encounter with American\npragmatism, he developed a manuscript on personality in the social\nworld that stressed the pragmatic elements of the everyday social\nworld.\n\nSchutz\u2019s career, academic and business, was thoroughly convulsed\nwhen Adolf Hitler implemented the annexation (Anschluss) of\nAustria by Germany on March 13, 1938, especially since he, on a\nbusiness trip in Paris, was separated for three months from his own\nfamily, whose emigration to Paris he finally arranged. As an\ninternational lawyer and businessperson, he was able to assist\nnumerous intellectuals to escape Austria, but the westward movement of\nthe Nazi juggernaut eventually compelled him to immigrate with his\nfamily to the United States on July 14, 1939.\n\nIn the United States, he continued assisting immigrants and working\nwith Reitler and Company in reestablishing its business, and he\nsupported the United States war effort by reporting on German and\nAustrian economic matters for the Board of Economic Warfare. He also\ncooperated with Marvin Farber in founding the International\nPhenomenological Society, whose initial turf-battles he often\nmediated, and in instituting and editing Philosophy and\nPhenomenological Research. In 1943, Schutz began teaching\nsociology and philosophy courses on The Graduate Faculty of The New\nSchool for Social Research, and his responsibilities included\npresenting papers in the school-wide General Seminar, supervising\ndissertations, and serving as chair of the Philosophy Department from\n1952\u20131956. In spite of his many activities, he managed to carry\non an extensive philosophical correspondence with Farber, Aron\nGurwitsch, Fritz Machlup, Eric Voegelin, and Maurice Natanson, his\ngraduate student from 1951 to 1953. However, to date, only the\ncorrespondences with Gurwitsch and Voegelin have been published. While\nin the United States, Schutz published a collection of articles on a\nwide variety of topics, explaining and criticizing Husserl\u2019s\nthought; examining the works of American philosophers such as William\nJames or George Santanyana; engaging continental philosophers such as\nMax Scheler or Jean-Paul Sartre; developing his own philosophical\npositions on the social sciences, temporality, language, multiple\nrealities, responsibility, and symbolism; addressing socio-political\nquestions dealing with strangers, homecomers, well-informed citizens,\nand equality; and treating themes in literature and music.\n\nSeveral thinkers have continued Schutz\u2019s tradition in philosophy\nand sociology, such as Maurice Natanson who emphasized the tension\nbetween individual, existential and social, anonymizing dimensions of\neveryday life experience. Thomas Luckmann, who served as co-author for\nthe posthumous publication of Schutz\u2019s The Structures of the\nLife-World, developed the sociology of knowledge implications of\nSchutz\u2019s thought and stressed the differences between science\nand the life-world as well as the importance of language, symbolism,\nand the moral order of society. While John O\u2019Neill has fused\nSchutz\u2019s thought with that of Merleau-Ponty by focusing on the\nlived, communicative body, Richard Grathoff has investigated the\nexperience of normality within the bounded and situated context of a\nmilieu. Ilja Srubar developed the pragmatic dimensions of\nSchutz\u2019s thought and several of its economic and political\nimplications, Lester Embree clarified his typology of the sciences,\nand Fred Kersten has expanded his aesthetic insights. Drawing on\nSchutz\u2019s thought, Harold Garfinkel launched ethnomethodology,\nand George Psathas, a commentator on ethnomethodology, played a key\nrole initiating the new discipline of conversation analysis. Several\nother scholars worldwide have dedicated themselves to Schutz\u2019s\nwork and to the development of his insights, and Germany, Japan, and\nthe United States are home to archives containing Schutz\u2019s work\nand correspondence.\n",
