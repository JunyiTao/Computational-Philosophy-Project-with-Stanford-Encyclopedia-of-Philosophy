    "main_text": "The Debate over the Conventionality of Language || Language Use as a Convention: the Basic View\n2.1 Language Use as a Convention: the Basic View\n\nLewis\u2019s (1975) take on human languages results from his attempt\nto solve an apparent paradox. On the one hand, languages are functions\nfrom sentences to meanings, and a theory of meaning for any language\nwill describe such functions. On the other hand, a natural\nlanguage is a social practice followed by a given population. It seems\nthat languages (simpliciter) and natural languages belong to deeply\ndifferent categories, raising the puzzle of how the two might be\nrelated. One difference is that there are indefinitely many languages,\nbut the great majority are not even potentially natural languages.\nThey could not be learned, acquired, or deployed by humans because\nthey have an infinite lexicon, for example, or infinitely many rules\nof composition, or allow for an unlimited embedding of subordinate\nsentences. Another difference is that languages are abstract objects\nwhile a natural language appears to be a concrete thing that, by\ndefinition, is learned, acquired, and developed by members of a\nspecific human population.\n\nLewis claims that we can incorporate both perspectives within a single\nview. Natural languages, he says, are a proper subset of the set of\nlanguages. More specifically, a natural language is a function\nL from sentences to meanings that a particular population uses,\nwhere this use of L is governed by a convention of\n\u201ctruthfulness and trust in L\u201d. To understand this\nproposal, we need to understand (a) Lewis\u2019s conception of the\nmotive a population might have to use L, (b) what he means by\n\u201cconvention\u201d, and (c) how he thinks a language\u2014a\nfunction from sentences to meanings\u2014could figure within a\nconvention thus understood.\n(a) At the most general level, members of any population often want\nthe others to think and act in a particular way. This requires them to\nrecognize each other\u2019s intentions, share thoughts, and to act\naccordingly. Members of the population must therefore find a way to\ndisplay their intentions, etc., and, in equal measure, to recognize\nthe intentions, etc., of others. Using the same language (i.e., the\nsame function from sentences to meanings) to convey their mental\nstates offers an excellent way of meeting this need. It gives members\nof the population a way to \u201ccontrol others\u2019 beliefs and\nactions to some extent by means of sounds and marks\u201d (Lewis\n1975: 166). Lewis explains how they do this\u2014and in particular\nhow they settle on the same language\u2014by invoking his general\nnotion of a convention.\n(b) A convention is a practice that solves a coordination problem\nwithin a community. The solution will bring mutual benefits but it\nwill also be arbitrary. For example, the practice in North America of\ndriving on the right is a convention in this sense: it is a mutually\nbeneficial practice, but at least one other solution to the problem of\navoiding head-on collisions is available: driving on the left. Natural\nlanguages (i.e., the use of languages by populations along the lines\ndescribed in (a)) seem to be conventions in this simple sense. The\nexistence of shared meanings within a community is clearly of mutual\nbenefit, as evidenced, for example, by the use of English among\nEnglish-speaking populations. It allows members of a population to\nlearn one another\u2019s thoughts about the world, for example. But\nthere are many other solutions to the problem of finding out one\nanother\u2019s thoughts about the world, such as using Spanish or\nJapanese, so the choice is arbitrary.\n\nMoving beyond this simple account of conventionality, Lewis tells us\nthat a convention in his sense is a regularity R in action\n(driving on the left, for example) or in belief within a population\nP for which the following six conditions nearly always\nhold:\n\nEveryone conforms to R.\nEveryone believes the others conform to R.\nThe belief in (2) gives each believer a (practical or epistemic)\nreason to conform to R.\nGeneral conformity is generally preferred to\nslightly-less-than-general conformity.\nR is not the only regularity that could satisfy (3) and\n(4).\n(1)\u2013(5) are known matters of mutual knowledge: they are\nknown to everyone, and it is known that they are known to everyone,\nand so on.\n\n\n(2) and (3) jointly predict that R perpetuates itself within\nthe community (as in (1)), despite being (according to (5))\narbitrarily chosen. A convention is stable within a community because\nit is rational for each member of the community to abide by it. (The\n convention\n entry goes into more detail.)\n\n(c) How could the use of a language in Lewis\u2019s sense (a function\npairing sentences with meanings) be a convention in his sense, i.e., a\nregularity satisfying conditions (1) to (6)? Lewis\u2019s answer is\nthat the regularity, the R, is the practice of being truthful\nand trusting in a language, L. When this practice is a\nconvention in a community, L is the community\u2019s language.\nTo be truthful in L is to utter a sentence only if one believes\nthat what it means in L holds. To be trusting in L is to\nbelieve whatever is meant in L by the sentences one hears\nuttered. Together, these conventions give rise to a basic two-way\ncooperation, with speakers being truthful and hearers being trusting.\nWithout this two-way coordination the coordination problem would be\ndifficult (if not impossible) to solve. If speakers are not truthful,\nwhat they say is not trustworthy evidence of what they think. If\nhearers are not trusting, what speakers say is not useful to get\nhearers to believe and act in the intended manner.\n\nPutting this together with the six conditions that define what it is\nto be a convention, a language L is the natural language of a\ngiven community when the following six conditions hold, at least to a\nsignificant degree:\n\nEveryone is truthful and trusting in L.\nEveryone believes the others are truthful and trusting in\nL.\nThe belief in (2) gives each a reason to be truthful and trusting\nin L.\nGeneral conformity to truthfulness and trustfulness in L is\ngenerally preferred to slightly-less-than-general conformity.\nL is not the only language that could satisfy (3) and\n(4).\n(1)\u2013(5) are known matters of mutual knowledge: they are\nknown to everyone, and it is known that they are known to everyone,\nand so on.\n\n",
