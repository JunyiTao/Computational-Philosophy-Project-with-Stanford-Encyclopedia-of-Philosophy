    "main_text": "Peirce\u2019s Early Account: 1867\u20138. || Thought-Signs\n2.1 Thought-Signs\n\nAn interesting feature of Peirce\u2019s early account is that he is keen to\nassociate signs with cognition. In particular, Peirce claims that all\nthought is in signs (W2. 213). We can see this from Peirce\u2019s early\nidea that every interpretant is itself a further sign of the signified\nobject. Since interpretants are the interpreting thoughts we have of\nsignifying relations, and these interpreting thoughts are themselves\nsigns, it seems to be a straight-forward consequence that all thoughts\nare signs, or as Peirce calls them \u201cthought-signs\u201d. One\ninteresting consequence of this is that in the early account, Peirce\nis quick to dismiss the importance and relevance of icons and\nindices.\n\nThe objects of the understanding, considered as representations, are\nsymbols, that is, signs which are at least potentially general. But\nthe rules of logic hold good of any symbols, of those which are\nwritten or spoken as well as those which are thought. They have no\nimmediate application to likeness [icons] or indices, because no\narguments can be constructed of these alone, but do apply to all\nsymbols. (W2. 56)\n\n\nThis gives Peirce\u2019s early account of signs a rather narrow scope; it\nis concerned primarily with the general and conventional signs of\nwhich our language and cognition consist. The reason for this narrow\nfocus is simple: for Peirce, since symbols are \u201cpotentially\ngeneral\u201d and fall under the remit of general rules, they are a\nfit subject of study for his primary focus, logic. This early account,\nthen, focuses mainly on general and conventional signs, those signs\nidentified by Peirce as symbols. Icons and indices, although noted at\nthis early stage, are considered of secondary philosophical\nimportance. As we shall see later, this narrow focus is something that\nPeirce was later to revise.\n",
