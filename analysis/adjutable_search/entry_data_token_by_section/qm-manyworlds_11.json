    "main_text": "Probability in the MWI || Probability from Uncertainty\n4.1 Probability from Uncertainty\n\nThe difficulty with the concept of probability in a deterministic\ntheory, such as the MWI, is that the only possible meaning for\nprobability is an ignorance probability, but there is no\nrelevant information that an observer who is going to perform a\nquantum experiment is ignorant about. The quantum state of the\nUniverse at one time specifies the quantum state at all times. If I am\ngoing to perform a quantum experiment with two possible outcomes such\nthat standard quantum mechanics predicts probability 1/3 for outcome A\nand 2/3 for outcome B, then, according to the MWI, both the world with\noutcome A and the world with outcome B will exist. It is senseless to\nask: \u201cWhat is the probability that I will get A instead of\nB?\u201d because I will correspond to both \u201cLev\u201ds: the\none who observes A and the other one who observes B.\n\nTo solve this difficulty, Albert and Loewer 1988 proposed the Many\nMinds interpretation (in which the different worlds are only in the\nminds of sentient beings). In addition to the quantum wave of the\nUniverse, Albert and Loewer postulate that every sentient being has a\ncontinuum of minds. Whenever the quantum wave of the Universe develops\ninto a superposition containing states of a sentient being\ncorresponding to different perceptions, the minds of this sentient\nbeing evolve randomly and independently to mental states corresponding\nto these different states of perception (with probabilities equal to\nthe quantum probabilities for these states). In particular, whenever a\nmeasurement is performed by an observer, the observer\u2019s minds\ndevelop mental states that correspond to perceptions of the different\noutcomes, i.e. corresponding to the worlds A or B in our example.\nSince there is a continuum of minds, there will always be an infinity\nof minds in any sentient being and the procedure can continue\nindefinitely. This resolves the difficulty: each \u201cI\u201d\ncorresponds to one mind and it ends up in a state corresponding to a\nworld with a particular outcome. However, this solution comes at the\nprice of introducing additional structure into the theory, including a\ngenuinely random process.\n\nSaunders 2010 claims to solve the problem without introducing\nadditional structure into the theory. Working in the Heisenberg\npicture, he uses appropriate semantics and mereology according to\nwhich distinct worlds have no parts in common, not even at early times\nwhen the worlds are qualitatively identical. In the terminology of\nLewis 1986 (p. 206) we have the divergence of worlds rather than\noverlap. Wilson 2013, 2020 develops this idea by introducing a\nframework called \u201cindexicalism\u201d, which involves a set of\ndistinct diverging \u201cparallel\u201d worlds in which each\nobserver is located in only one world and all propositions are\nconstrued as self-locating (indexical). In Wilson\u2019s words,\n\u201cindexicalism\u201d allows us to vindicate treating the weights\nas a candidate objective probability measure. However, it is\nnot clear how this program can succeed, see Marchildon 2015, Harding\n2020, Tappenden 2019a. It is hard to identify diverging worlds in our\nexperience and there is nothing in the mathematical formalism of\nstandard quantum mechanics which can be a counterpart of diverging\nworlds, see also Kent 2010 (p. 345). In the next section, the measure\nof existence of worlds is related to subjective ignorance\nprobability.\n\nThere are more proposals to deal with the issue of probability in the\nMWI. Barrett 2017 argues that for a derivation of the Probability\nPostulate it is necessary to add some assumptions to unitary\nevolution. For example, Weissman 1999 has proposed a modification of\nquantum theory with additional non-linear decoherence (and hence with\neven more worlds than in the standard MWI) which can lead\nasymptotically to worlds of equal mean measure for different outcomes.\nHanson 2003, 2006 proposed decoherence dynamics in which observers of\ndifferent worlds \u201cmangle\u201d each other such that an\napproximate Born rule is obtained. Van Wesep 2006 used an algebraic\nmethod for deriving the probability rule, whereas Buniy et\nal. 2006 used the decoherent histories approach of Gell-Mann and\nHartle 1990. Waegell and McQueen 2020 considered probability based on\nthe ontology of `local worlds\u2019 introduced by Waegell 2018, which\nis a concept inspired by the approach of Deutsch and Hayden 2000.\n",
