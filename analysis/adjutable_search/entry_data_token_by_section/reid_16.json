    "main_text": "Memory and Personal Identity\n5. Memory and Personal Identity\n\n\nReid constructs a theory of personal identity in opposition to Locke's\naccount, which appeals to psychological continuity as a necessary\ncondition for sameness of person over time. Reid argues that Locke has\nmisunderstood the relationship between consciousness and memory. Reid\ndevelops a direct theory of memory according to which the objects of\nmemory are events in the past, not mental representations. Reid\nattempts to provide sufficient continuity of the self through time to\nground sameness of person without lapsing into Humean skepticism about\nthe self.\n",
