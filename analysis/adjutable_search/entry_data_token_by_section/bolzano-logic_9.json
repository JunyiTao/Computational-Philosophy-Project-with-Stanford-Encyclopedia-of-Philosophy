    "main_text": "Bolzano\u2019s logic of variation || Universal validity/invalidity and analyticity\n6.2 Universal validity/invalidity and analyticity\n\nBolzano begins by defining attributes of of single propositions with\nvariable parts (TS, \u00a7147). When the method of variation\nis applied to a proposition, he notes, three different cases may\narise: either the class of (objectual) propositions obtained by\nsubstitution contains only true propositions, or it contains only\nfalse propositions, or it contains both true and false propositions.\nIn the first case, the initial proposition is called universally\nvalid, in the second universally invalid, in both cases\nrelative to the specified variables. Bolzano does not give a name to\nthe third case; such propositions could be called neutral. Here are\nsome examples:\n\n[The man Caius is mortal] \n\nis universally valid relative to the variable idea [Caius], because\neach appropriate substitution generates a true proposition, or\nalternatively, because all its objectual variants are true.\n\n[The man Caius is omniscient]\n\nis universally invalid relative to the same variable idea [Caius],\nbecause all its variants are false. \n\nThe same proposition\n\n[The man Caius is wealthy]\n\nis neutral relative to the variable idea [wealthy], because some of\nits variants are true (e.g., the first example quoted) while others\nare false (the second example).\n\nConsider now the proposition [Murgatroyd\u2019s favourite number, which is\nan integer between 1 and 10, is prime], and let [Murgatroyd\u2019s\nfavourite number] be tagged as variable. Furthermore, let us restrict\nthe class of permissible substituends by stipulating that (1)\nobjectuality be preserved and (2) no two equivalent ideas be included.\nIn this case, there will be eight permissible substitutions and, of\nthese, four will result in true propositions. The ratio of the number\nof substitutions resulting in true propositions to the total number is\naccordingly equal to 1:2. Bolzano calls this the degree of\nvalidity of the proposition relative to the specified variables.\nHe comments (TS, II: 81): \u201cThis ratio determines the\ndegree of probability which the proposition takes on under certain\ncircumstances.\u201d Universal validity and universal invalidity are\nextreme cases, in which the ratio is respectively equal to 1:1 and\n0:1.\n\nBolzano appropriated Kant\u2019s term analytic for\npropositions that are either universally valid or universally invalid\nrelative to some specification of variable parts or other. This choice\nof terminology was based on his analysis of Kant\u2019s examples.\nConsider, for instance, the proposition (Kant: judgement): [A\nright-angled triangle is a triangle]. Kant had declared such judgments\nanalytic because analysis, i.e., decomposition, of the subject concept\nwould reveal the presence of the predicate. For Bolzano, this\ncontainment relation was just a distraction: what was truly\ninteresting about this proposition, he thought, was that we could\nsubstitute whatever other ideas we like for [triangle] and\n[right-angled] without changing the truth-value (subject to the\nproviso about objectuality). That is, as Quine would later put it,\ncertain parts of such propositions occur vacuously: \n\n\nI believe that th[e] importance [of analytic propositions] lies in the\nfact that their truth or falsity does not depend upon the individual\nideas of which they are composed, but that it remains the same\nirrespective of the changes to which some of their ideas are\nsubjected, provided only that the objectuality of the proposition is\nnot destroyed (TS, \u00a7 148). \n\n\nThe truly noteworthy feature of the propositions Kant had called\nanalytic, that is, is the invariance of their truth-value under an\nentire class of transformations. It is this feature and no other that\nBolzano singles out with his definition of analyticity.\n\nGiven the breadth of Bolzano\u2019s definition, it is clear that\nanalytic propositions are quite common, notably in mathematics. Here\nare some of Bolzano\u2019s examples of analytic propositions, true as\nwell as false, where the underlining or the letters indicate the\nvariable parts:\n\nIf all men are mortal and Caius is a\nman, then Caius is mortal.\n(TS,\u00a7315)\nIf A is larger than B, then B is smaller than A.\n(TS,\u00a7148)\nIf \\(P=Mm\\), then \\(M = P/m\\). (TS, \u00a7148)\nThe soul of Socrates has been annihilated. (TS,\n\u00a7 369)\nThe soul of Socrates is a simple substance. (TS,\n\u00a7447)\nA is A. (TS, \u00a7148)\nAn A, which is B, is A. (TS, \u00a7148)\nAn A, which is B, is B. (TS, \u00a7148)\nEvery object is either B or non-B. (TS, \u00a7148)\n\n\nThe last four examples in the above list are noteworthy, Bolzano\nclaims, because the only invariable parts in them are logical\nconcepts. He speaks of logical analyticity in such cases.\nLike Tarski after him, he comments that his definition of logical\nanalyticity is not completely determinate, because the \u201cdomain\nof concepts belonging to logic is not circumscribed so sharply that\ncontroversies could not arise at times\u201d (TS, \u00a7\n148, no. 3; Tarski, 1983, 418\u2013419).\n\nThough the similarities should not be exaggerated, there are clear\naffinities between this narrower notion and later ones in the works of\nAdjukiewicz, Carnap, Quine, and Tarski (see K\u00fcnne, 2006 for\ndetailed discussion).\n\nAs Bolzano was well aware, analyticity in his general sense entails\nneither necessity nor apriority (TS, \u00a7197). [Truman, who\nwas president of the USA in in the 20th century, was male], for\ninstance, is universally valid with respect to [Truman], and thus\nanalytic according to Bolzano\u2019s definition. Clearly, his use of\nthe term \u2018analytic\u2019 differs radically not only from\nKant\u2019s, but also from later uses of the term in the writings of\nFrege, Carnap, and others. This has led to some misunderstandings on\nthe part of some of his later readers (e.g., Bar-Hillel, 1950).\n",
