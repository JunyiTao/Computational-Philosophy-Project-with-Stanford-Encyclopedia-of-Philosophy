    "main_text": "Common Sense and Certainty\n7. Moore's Legacy\n\n\nMoore was not a systematic philosopher: unlike Reid's philosophy of\ncommon sense, Moore's \u2018common sense\u2019 is not a system. Even\nin ethics, where he comes closest to presenting a \u2018theory\u2019\nhe explicitly disavows any aspiration to provide a systematic account\nof the good. Hence, as the preceding discussions show, Moore's legacy\nis primarily a collection of arguments, puzzles and challenges. One\nnotable addition to those mentioned already is \u2018Moore's\nparadox\u2019: if I am mistaken about something, then I believe\nsomething which is not the case \u2014 perhaps that it is raining when\nit is not. Yet if I attribute this mistake to myself by saying\n\u2018It's not raining but I believe that it is\u2019 my statement is\nabsurd. Why is this so? Why is it absurd for me to say something that\nit is true about myself? Moore himself thought that the explanation\nhere was just that we generally believe the things we say, so that when\nsaying \u2018It's not raining\u2019 I imply that I believe this; but\nWittgenstein rightly saw that this explanation was superficial and that\nMoore had put his finger on a much deeper phenomenon here which\nconcerns our sense of our own identity as thinkers.\n\n\nThis case is typical. Moore had an unparalleled ability for\nidentifying philosophical \u2018phenomena\u2019. His own discussions\nof their significance are not always satisfying; but he would be the\nfirst to acknowledge his own fallibility. What matters is that if we\nstart where he starts we can be sure that we are dealing with something\nthat will tell us something important about ourselves and the\nworld.\n",
