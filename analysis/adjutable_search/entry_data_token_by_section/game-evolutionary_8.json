    "main_text": "Applications of Evolutionary Game Theory || The emergence of language.\n5.2 The emergence of language.\n\nIn his seminal work Convention, David Lewis developed the\nidea of sender-receiver games. Such games have been used to explain\nhow language, and semantic content, can emerge in a community which\noriginally did not possess any language\n whatsoever.[10]\n His original definition is as follows (with portions of extraneous\ncommentary deleted for concision and points enumerated for clarity and\nlater reference):\n\nA two-sided signaling problem is a situation \\(S\\) involving\nan agent called the communicator and one or more other agents\ncalled the audience, such that it is true that, and it is\ncommon knowledge for the communicator and the audience that:\n\n\nExactly one of several alternative states of affairs \\(s_1 ,\n\\ldots ,s_m\\) holds. The communicator, but not the audience, is in a\ngood position to tell which one it is.\nEach member of the audience can do any one of several alternative\nactions \\(r_1 , \\ldots ,r_m\\) called responses. Everyone\ninvolved wants the audience\u2019s responses to depend in a certain\nway upon the state of affairs that holds. There is a certain\none-to-one function \\(F\\) from \\(\\{s_i\\}\\) onto \\(\\{r_j\\}\\) such that\neveryone prefers that each member of the audience do \\(F(s_i)\\) on\ncondition that \\(s_i\\) holds, for each \\(s_i\\).\nThe communicator can do any one of several alternative actions\n\\(\\sigma_1 , \\ldots ,\\sigma_n (n \\ge m)\\) called signals. The\naudience is in a good position to tell which one he does. No one\ninvolved has any preference regarding these actions which is strong\nenough to outweigh his preference for the dependence \\(F\\) of\naudience\u2019s responses upon states of affairs. [\u2026]\nA communicator\u2019s contingency plan is any possible\nway in which the communicator\u2019s signal may depend upon the state\nof affairs that he observes to hold. It is a function \\(Fc\\) from\n\\(\\{s_i\\}\\) into \\(\\{\\sigma_k \\}\\). [\u2026]\nSimilarly, an audience\u2019s contingency plan is any\npossible way in which the response of a member of the audience may\ndepend upon the signal he observes the communicator to give. It is a\none-to-one function \\(Fa\\) from part of \\(\\{\\sigma_k\\}\\) into\n\\(\\{r_j\\}\\). [\u2026]\n\n\nWhenever \\(Fc\\) and \\(Fa\\) combine [\u2026] to give the preferred\ndependence of the audience\u2019s response upon the state of affairs,\nwe call \\(\\langle Fc, Fa\\rangle\\) a signaling system. (Lewis,\n1969, pp. 130\u2013132)\n\n\nSince the publication of Convention, it is more common to\nrefer to the communicator as the sender and the members of\nthe audience as receivers. The basic idea behind\nsender-receiver games is the following: Nature selects which state of\nthe world obtains. The person in the role of Sender observes this\nstate of the world (correctly identifying it), and sends a signal to\nthe person in the role of Receiver. The Receiver, upon receipt of this\nsignal, performs a response. If what the Receiver does is the correct\nresponse, given the state of the world, then both players receive a\npayoff of 1; if the Receiver performed an incorrect response, then\nboth players receive a payoff of 0. Notice that, in this simplified\nmodel, no chance of error exists at any stage. The Sender always\nobserves the true state of the world and always sends the signal he\nintended to send. Likewise, the Receiver always receives the signal\nsent by the Sender (i.e., the channel is not noisy), and the Receiver\nalways performs the response he intended to.\n\nWhereas Lewis allowed the \u201caudience\u201d to consist of more\nthan one person, it is more common to consider sender-receiver games\nplayed between two people, so that there is only a single receiver\n(or, in Lewisian terms, a single member of the\n audience).[11]\n For simplicity, in the following we will consider a two-player,\nsender-receiver game with two states of the world \\(\\{S_1, S_2\\}\\),\ntwo signals \\(\\{\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2\\}\\), and two responses \\(\\{r_1,\nr_2\\}\\). (We shall see later why larger sender-receiver games are\nincreasingly difficult to analyse.)\n\nNotice that, in point (2) of his definition of sender-receiver games,\nLewis requires two things: that there be a unique best response to the\nstate of the world (this is what requiring \\(F\\) to be one-to-one\namounts to) and that everyone in the audience agrees that this is the\ncase. Since we are considering the case where there is only a single\nresponder, the second requirement is otiose. For the case of two\nstates of the world and two responses, there are only two ways of\nassigning responses to states of the world which satisfy Lewis\u2019s\nrequirement. These are as follows (where \\(X \\Rightarrow Y\\) denotes\n\u201cin state of the world \\(X\\), the best response is to do\n\\(Y\\)\u201d):\n\n\\(S_1 \\Rightarrow r_1, S_2 \\Rightarrow r_2\\).\n\\(S_1 \\Rightarrow r_2, S_2 \\Rightarrow r_1\\).\n\n\nIt makes no real difference for the model which one of these we\nchoose, so pick the intuitive one: in state of the world \\(S_i\\), the\nbest response is \\(r_i\\) (i.e., function 1).\n\nA strategy for the sender (what Lewis called a\n\u201ccommunicator\u2019s contingency plan\u201d) consists of a\nfunction specifying what signal he sends given the state of the world.\nIt is, as Lewis notes, a function from the set of states of the world\ninto the set of signals. This means that it is possible that\na sender may send the same signal in two different states of\nthe world. Such a strategy makes no sense, from a rational point of\nview, because the receiver would not get enough information to be able\nto identify the correct response for the state of the world. However,\nwe do not exclude these strategies from consideration because they are\nlogically possible strategies.\n\nHow many sender strategies are there? Because we allow for the\npossibility of the same signal to be sent for multiple states of the\nworld, there are two choices for which signal to send given state\n\\(S_1\\) and two choices for which signal to send given state \\(S_2\\).\nThis means there are four possible sender strategies. These strategies\nare as follows (where \\(\\mathrm{`}X \\rightarrow Y\\text{'}\\) means that\nwhen the state of the world is \\(X\\) the sender will send signal\n\\(Y)\\):\n\nSender 1:  \\(S_1 \\rightarrow \\sigma_1, S_2\n\\rightarrow \\sigma_1\\).\n\nSender 2:  \\(S_1 \\rightarrow \\sigma_1, S_2\n\\rightarrow \\sigma_2\\).\n\nSender 3:  \\(S_1 \\rightarrow \\sigma_2, S_2\n\\rightarrow \\sigma_1\\).\n\nSender 4:  \\(S_1 \\rightarrow \\sigma_2, S_2\n\\rightarrow \\sigma_2\\).\n\n\nWhat is a strategy for a receiver? Here, it proves useful to deviate\nfrom Lewis\u2019s original definition of the \u201caudience\u2019s\ncontingency plan\u201d. Instead, let us take a receiver\u2019s\nstrategy to be a function from the set of signals into the set of\nresponses. As in the case of the sender, we allow the receiver to\nperform the same response for more than one signal. By symmetry, this\nmeans there are \\(\\mathbf{4}\\) possible receiver strategies. These\nreceiver strategies are:\n\nReceiver 1:  \\(\\sigma_1 \\rightarrow r_1, \\sigma_2\n\\rightarrow r_1\\).\n\nReceiver 2:  \\(\\sigma_1 \\rightarrow r_1, \\sigma_2\n\\rightarrow r_2\\).\n\nReceiver 3:  \\(\\sigma_1 \\rightarrow r_2, \\sigma_2\n\\rightarrow r_1\\).\n\nReceiver 4:  \\(\\sigma_1 \\rightarrow r_2, \\sigma_2\n\\rightarrow r_2\\).\n\n\nIf the roles of Sender and Receiver are permanently assigned to\nindividuals \u2014 as Lewis envisaged \u2014 then there are only two\nsignaling systems: \\(\\langle\\)Sender 2, Receiver 2\\(\\rangle\\) and\n\\(\\langle\\)Sender 3, Receiver 3\\(\\rangle\\). All other possible\ncombinations of strategies result in the players failing to\ncoordinate. The coordination failure occurs because the Sender and\nReceiver only pair the appropriate action with the state of the world\nin one instance, as with \\(\\langle\\)Sender 1, Receiver 1\\(\\rangle\\),\nor not at all, as with \\(\\langle\\)Sender 2, Receiver 3\\(\\rangle\\).\n\nWhat if the roles of Sender and Receiver are not permanently assigned\nto individuals? That is, what if nature flips a coin and assigns one\nplayer to the role of Sender and the other player to the role of\nReceiver, and then has them play the game? In this case, a\nplayer\u2019s strategy needs to specify what he will do when assigned\nthe role of Sender, as well as what he will do when assigned the role\nof Receiver. Since there are four possible strategies to use as Sender\nand four possible strategies to use as Receiver, this means that there\nare a total of \\(\\mathbf{16}\\) possible strategies for the\nsender-receiver game when roles are not permanently assigned to\nindividuals. Here, a player\u2019s strategy consists of an ordered\npair (Sender \\(X\\), Receiver \\(Y)\\), where \\(X, Y \\in \\{1, 2, 3,\n4\\}\\).\n\nIt makes a difference whether one considers the roles of Sender and\nReceiver to be permanently assigned or not. If the roles are assigned\nat random, there are four signaling systems amongst two\n players[12]:\n\nPlayer 1:  (Sender 2, Receiver 2), Player\n2:  (Sender 2, Receiver 2)\nPlayer 1:  (Sender 3, Receiver 3), Player\n2:  (Sender 3, Receiver 3)\nPlayer 1:  (Sender 2, Receiver 3), Player\n2:  (Sender 3, Receiver 2)\nPlayer 1:  (Sender 3, Receiver 2), Player\n2:  (Sender 2, Receiver 3)\n\n\nSignaling systems 3 and 4 are curious. System 3 is a case where, for\nexample, I speak in French but listen in German, and you speak German\nbut listen in French. (System 4 swaps French and German for both you\nand me.) Notice that in systems 3 and 4 the players are able to\ncorrectly coordinate the response with the state of the world\nregardless of who gets assigned the role of Sender or\nReceiver.\n\nThe problem, of course, with signaling systems 3 and 4 is that neither\nPlayer 1 nor Player 2 would do well when pitted against a clone of\nhimself. They are cases where the signaling system would not work in a\npopulation of players who are pairwise randomly assigned to play the\nsender-receiver game. In fact, it is straightforward to show that the\nstrategies (Sender 2, Receiver 2) and (Sender 3, Receiver 3) are the\nonly evolutionarily stable strategies (see Skyrms 1996,\n89\u201390).\n\nAs a first approach to the dynamics of sender-receiver games, let us\nrestrict attention to the four strategies (Sender 1, Receiver 1),\n(Sender 2, Receiver 2), (Sender 3, Receiver 3), and (Sender 4,\nReceiver 4). Figure 16 illustrates the state space under the\ncontinuous replicator dynamics for the sender-receiver game consisting\nof two states of the world, two signals, and two responses, where\nplayers are restricted to using one of the previous four strategies.\nOne can see that evolution leads the population in almost all\n cases[13]\n to converge to one of the two signaling\n systems.[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\nFigure 16: The evolution of signaling\nsystems.\n\n\nFigure 17 illustrates the outcome of one run of the replicator\ndynamics (for a single population model) where all sixteen possible\nstrategies are represented. We see that eventually the population, for\nthis particular set of initial conditions, converges to one of the\npure Lewisian signalling systems identified above.\n\n\n\nFigure 17: The evolution of a signalling\nsystem under the replicator dynamics.\n\n\nWhen the number of states of the world, the number of signals, and the\nnumber of actions increase from 2, the situation rapidly becomes much\nmore complex. If there are \\(N\\) states of the world, \\(N\\) signals,\nand \\(N\\) actions, the total number of possible strategies equals\n\\(N^{2N}\\). For \\(N=2\\), this means there are 16 possible strategies,\nas we have seen. For \\(N=3\\), there are 729 possible strategies, and a\nsignalling problem where \\(N=4\\) has 65,536 possible strategies. Given\nthis, one might think that it would prove difficult for evolution to\nsettle upon an optimal signalling system.\n\nSuch an intuition is correct. Hofbauer and Hutteger (2008) show that,\nquite often, the replicator dynamics will converge to a suboptimal\noutcome in signalling games. In these suboptimal outcomes, a\npooling or partial pooling equilibrium will emerge.\nA pooling equilibrium occurs when the Sender uses the same signal\nregardless of the state of the world. A partial pooling equilibrium\noccurs when the Sender is capable of differentiating between some\nstates of the world but not others. As an example of a partial pooling\nequilibrium, consider the following strategies for the case where\n\\(N=3\\): Suppose that the Sender sends signal 1 in state of the world\n1, and signal 2 in states of the world 2 and 3. Furthermore, suppose\nthat the Receiver performs action 1 upon receipt of signal 1, and\naction 2 upon receipt of signals 2 and 3. If all states of the world\nare equiprobable, this is a partial pooling equilibrium. Given that\nthe Sender does not differentiate states of the world 2 and 3, the\nReceiver cannot improve his payoffs by responding differently to\nsignal 2. Given the particular response behaviour of the Receiver, the\nSender cannot improve her payoffs by attempting to differentiate\nstates of the world 2 and 3.\n",
