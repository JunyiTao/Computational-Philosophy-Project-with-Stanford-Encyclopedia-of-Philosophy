    "main_text": "Principal Varieties in More Detail || Borderline Cases and Hybrid Theories\n2.6 Borderline Cases and Hybrid Theories\n\nOften philosophical positions are introduced in rather pure and stark\nversions, only to be modified in light of arguments and objections so\nas to become more like competing theories over time. It should not be\ntoo surprising that this is the case in metaethics and that present\nday non-cognitivist theories are less distinguishable from cognitivist\nalternatives than earlier versions. It can even be a controversial\nmatter whether theories developed within the non-cognitivist tradition\nbut modified to handle objections still deserve the label. The\nvarieties of emotivism which postulate both descriptive meaning and\nemotive meaning have sometimes aroused such suspicions and the more\ndeveloped hybrids discussed at the end of this section are in that\ntradition. Furthermore, while paradigm non-cognitivists accept each of\nthe two negative theses outlined above, there are views which accept\nonly one of the two without the other. These positions constitute two\nmetaethical theories which we might think of as borderline cases lying\njust outside the non-cognitivist region of logical space.\n\nHermeneutic moral fictionalists are not semantic non-factualists.\nMoral sentences are regarded as genuinely truth-apt. Such sentences do\nhave truth conditions and an assertive sentence using a moral\npredicate does predicate a property. Yet, in normal use these\nsentences are not strictly speaking true. Thus far the hermeneutic\nfictionalist agrees with error theorists. But while error theorists\nthink that the falsity of moral sentences implies that ordinary moral\ntalk is massively in error, fictionalists disagree. According to the\nhermeneutic fictionalist a speaker uttering a false moral sentence is\ntypically not expressing a belief in the content expressed by the\nsentence. Rather such speakers are using it fictively, and this use\ninvolves no error. Thus, fictionalists are psychological\nnon-cognitivists. Use of a moral sentence does not communicate that\nthe speaker believes the proposition expressed by that sentence.\nRather speakers use such sentences to express other, non-cognitive\nstates of mind. Just as with standard versions of non-cognitivism,\nfictionalists will generally offer a story about the nature of the\nnon-cognitive attitude expressed. For example, they may suggest that\nthe state of mind is an intention to act as if the moral judgment\nexpressing the intention is true (Kalderon 2005b). At the same time,\nbecause they are not pursuing the expressivist semantic program the\nexpression relation need not be exactly what ordinary expressivists\ntake it to be. Since they need not require a one\u2013to\u2013one\nmapping of moral sentences onto states of mind that express them to\nsupport their semantic theory, fictionalists can allow for more\nvariation in the states of mind such sentences (loosely) express.\nHermeneutic fictionalism is often contrasted with revolutionary\nfictionalism. Revolutionary moral fictionalists think we should reform\nour current cognitively committed use of normative language to work\nroughly as the hermeneutic fictionalist thinks we already do (Joyce\n2001, 2005). They are thus not committed to non-cognitivism about\nactual current use of moral terms in the way that hermeneutic\nfictionalists seem to be. Revolutionary fictionalists could be read as\nproposing that we convert to using moral language to express something\nother than belief with our indicative moral sentences, but\nrevolutionary fictionalists have not usually presented their reforms\nin that way. That should not be too surprising. Fictionalist rejection\nof semantic nonfactualism leads most taxonomists to omit fictionalism\nfrom the non-cognitivist genus. Still at least one prominent\nhermeneutic fictionalist has presented his view as a version of\nnon-cognitivism (Kalderon 2005b) drawing on some comments in MacIntyre\n(1981, 15\u201318). (See also Beddor, 2023)\n\nFor more detail on fictionalism see the entry on\n fictionalism.\n\nIn contrast, Terry Horgan and Mark Timmons have propounded a view\nwhich they call Nondescriptivist Cognitivism. As the label suggests,\nthey do not regard their view as a species of non-cognitivism, but\nlike fictionalism the view does accept one of non-cognitivism\u2019s\ntwo constitutive negative theses while rejecting the other. However,\nwith respect to each thesis Horgan and Timmons\u2019s choices\ncontrast with those made by fictionalism. Nondescriptivist cognitivism\nspurns psychological non-cognitivism, but embraces semantic\nnonfactualism, at least insofar as it rejects the claim that moral\nsentences describe the world or predicate genuine properties (Horgan\n& Timmons 2000; Timmons 1999). The precise content of the view can\nbe difficult to pin down. Horgan and Timmons challenge a standard\nHumean division of the mind into a domain of cognitive states which\nrepresent the world as being some way and a separate domain of\nnoncognitive states that do not represent the world. Rather they think\nthere is an important division within the cognitive domain\nbetween beliefs that represent the world and beliefs that do not do\nthis but which have non-descriptive but cognitive content.\nNondescriptive Cognitivism then holds that moral judgments express\nsuch nondescriptive but cognitive states. Indicative sentences apt for\nexpressing these mental states (in one sense of \u2018express\u2019)\nalso semantically express the contents of these\nnondescriptive states just as on a more standard picture indicative\nsentences semantically express the propositions that are the contents\nof sentences that (in a different sense of \u2018express\u2019)\nexpress beliefs. Whether this is in fact a distinctive cognitivist\nposition will depend on the best way of dividing up different sorts of\nmental states. Some will think that Horgan and Timmons have stipulated\na new use for old terms, but they respond by defending\nphenomenological criteria for dividing cognitive from non-cognitive\nmental states that justify counting nonrepresentational states among\nthe cognitive.\n\nHowever that debate comes out, it is nevertheless worth noting the\nview as one which makes trouble for the standard division between\ncognitivist and non-cognitivist views. Together with fictionalism it\nillustrates a position which accepts only one of the two negative\ntheses constitutive of standard non-cognitivism. If such views are\ncoherent this would suggest the two negative theses are logically\nindependent.\n\nHybrid-expressivist theories can be thought of as another sort of\nborderline case but for a different reason. These theorists combine\nthe positive claims of expressivism \u2013 that moral sentences are\nconventional devices for the expression of pro-attitudes and that\nmoral attitudes are (partly) non-cognitive with features of\ncognitivism \u2013 that moral sentences predicate properties and that\nmoral attitudes are (partly) cognitive. There are a variety of ways of\ncombining these ideas and various extant theories adopt many of the\noptions.\n\nWe\u2019ve already noted a tendency for emotivists and\nprescriptivists to allow a kind of secondary descriptive meaning for\nmoral terms over and above their expressive meaning in order to\ncapture the way that moral statements can be used to convey\ndescriptive information. If I know that you are a utilitarian you\nmight convey the information that an action maximizes utility by\ntelling me that it is right. In such cases, what the speaker\nsuccessfully conveys depends on the audience\u2019s knowledge of the\nspeaker\u2019s moral views. One sort of hybrid theorist incorporates\nthis idea into the semantics of moral expressions. Such theorists\nsuggest that moral utterances as a matter of their semantics predicate\na property, one which is determined by the speaker\u2019s moral\nattitudes, while at the same time expressing a non-cognitive attitude\ntowards that property. Proponents hope that the view will have\nadvantage in explaining the communication of factual information with\nmoral terms and with handling the embedding problem (explained below),\nwhile also explaining the motivational efficacy of moral judgements.\nOne implementation of this view equates the main semantic content of a\nmoral predicate with the property it picks out (via a function from\nthe speaker\u2019s attitudes to the relevant properties), while use\nof the predicate conventionally implicates the presence of a pro or\ncon attitude (Barker 2000). A different implementation of the strategy\nincorporates both components into the semantic values of moral terms,\neven while the descriptive content is a function of the non-cognitive\nattitude expressed. More specifically on this way of developing the\nidea, moral sentences to the effect that something is right\nsemantically express both a proposition \u2013 that the action has a\nparticular property \u2013 and a particular positive attitude toward\nthat particular property. The particular property picked out itself\ndepends on the non-cognitive attitudes of the speaker, insofar as the\nproperty predicated is the most general property towards which the\nspeaker holds the non-cognitive attitudes expressed by the very same\njudgement(Ridge, 2006a, 2006b, 2014). One upshot is that the\ndescriptive content of a speaker\u2019s judgements can vary over time\nas the object of her attitudes change. John Eriksson(2009) suggests\nthat R. M. Hare was an early adopter of this kind of hybrid\ntheory.\n\nA contrasting sort of hybrid theory holds the descriptive content of\nmoral predicates constant. Such views are often modeled on slurs or\nepithets, as explicated in a certain way. It is plausible and perhaps\neven standard to think of slurs as semantically expressing a certain\ndescriptive property (being a member of such and such a group, say)\nwhile also conventionally expressing a negative attitude towards those\nwith the property. Copp (2001, 2009) and Boisvert (2008) suggest that\nmoral terms could function in the same way. Here again there are\nvarious ways to work out the details. Advocates of the approach can\nnote that it has advantages over the previous kind of hybrid theory in\nexplaining communication insofar as the descriptive content remains\nfixed from speaker to speaker (Schroeder 2009). And they claim that\nthe view does so without undermining the standard hybrid explanation\nof the motivational efficacy of moral judgements. Other theorists\nsuggest that pejoratives like \u2018idiot\u2019 present a better\nmodel than slurs (Hay 2013).\n\nAs the literature develops hybrid views get more complicated and\nsubtle. Close relatives of these theories claim to elude objections\ndirected at each of the above variants and yet the resulting theories\nare probably best understood as developments of these simpler variants\n(Schroeder 2013;Toppinen 2013).\n\nPerhaps hardest to characterize as a species of non-cognitivism are\nthe claims of several recent theorists who suggest that\nnon-cognitivism is best understood as a metasemantic theory. The claim\nseems to be that non-cognitivism is a theory not about the meaning of\nmoral sentences or about the contents of moral thoughts, but rather a\nstory at a different level about how sentences and thoughts come to\nhave these meanings or contents (Charlow 2015; Chrisman 2012, 2016;\nP\u00e9rez Carballo 2014; Ridge 2014; Silk 2014 at 217). One\nmotivation for the view seems to be that it allows noncognitivists to\ntake advantage of ordinary semantic theories and hence avoid the\nembedding problem. There isn\u2019t yet a lot of literature disputing\nthe idea, but Alwood (2016) expresses some skepticism about the\nadvantages of the approach. It is at least worth thinking about which\nof the standard motivations for non-cognitivism in ethics support the\nview when it is construed as a metasemantic theory. It is also worth\nthinking about exactly how the view contrasts with cognitivist views\non which attitudes can play a role in determining the content of\ncertain expressions, either generally or in particular occurrences.\nChances are the literature will take up such questions in the near\nfuture and subsequent versions of this entry will say more about the\ndevelopments to come.\n",
