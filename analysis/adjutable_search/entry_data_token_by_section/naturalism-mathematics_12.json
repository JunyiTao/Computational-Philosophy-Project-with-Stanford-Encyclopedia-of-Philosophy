    "main_text": "Motivating Naturalism || Naturalism is Revolutionary in some Respects\n4.1 Naturalism is Revolutionary in some Respects\n\n\nNaturalism is often thought to be a conservative philosophy of\nmathematics, as we suggested in section 1. But actually things are more\ncomplicated. Each of the three naturalisms of interest is revolutionary in some\nrespect.\n\n\nOur default view is that mathematical standards decide questions in\nmathematics proper, for example questions such as whether\nFermat's Last Theorem or the Axiom of Choice is true. Scientific\nstandards are thought not to affect this: when Andrew Wiles proved\nFermat's Last Theorem in the mid-1990s, he was not particularly\nconcerned with how his proof would go down in physics departments, or\nmore generally its impact on empirical science. Similarly, the claim\nthat if some large cardinal axiom is not scientifically sanctioned\n(perhaps because it leads to no new empirical consequences) then there\nis no good reason to accept it is, as Maddy points out, \u2018out of\nstep with the actual practice of set theory\u2019 (1997, 132), and\nindeed out of step with the actual practice of much philosophy. We\nusually do not judge large cardinal axioms by scientific standards; we\njudge them by mathematical standards. Quine was self-consciously going\nagainst the grain when he rejected the higher flights of set theory on\nscientific grounds (1986, 400).\n\n\nScientific naturalism about mathematics proper is thus a\nphilosophically revolutionary view, since it advocates a different set\nof standards with which to judge mathematics (scientific ones) from\nthe traditional ones (mathematical). It is also potentially\nrevolutionary about mathematics itself, as it might lead to a revision\nof mathematics. (Notice that even if scientific naturalism does not\nentail a revision of mathematics, it still counts as philosophically\nrevolutionary: advocating the replacement of Y-standards with\nX-standards as the proper arbiters in some domain is\nphilosophically revolutionary even if the Y-standards\nand X-standards happen to endorse the same claims in that\ndomain.) Having said that, recent scientific naturalists have tended\nto be mathematically conservative in temperament and have advocated\nlittle or no revision of mathematics.\n\n\nThese morals also apply to mathematical-cum-scientific naturalism,\nbut to a lesser extent, as the latter gives some weight to mathematical\nstandards in mathematical justification.\n\n\nThe third of the three naturalisms of interest, mathematical naturalism, is philosophically\nbut not mathematically revolutionary. Mathematically, it is as\nconservative as can be: no standards other than mathematical ones are\nrelevant to the assessment of mathematical claims. Thus no accepted\nmathematics is overturned from without. Yet mathematical naturalism is\na revolutionary stance in the philosophy of mathematics.  To see this,\nsuppose that platonism is part of standard, accepted mathematical\npractice. In that case, mathematical naturalism entails that there is\nno further question of its truth. Loosely put, simply because\nmathematicians (qua mathematicians) are platonists, platonism\nis the correct philosophy of mathematics. This is clearly out of step\nwith philosophical practice: philosophers look to mathematicians'\nviews (qua mathematicians) as defeasible data for the\nphilosophy of mathematics, not its conclusion. Thus we see that the\nsimple characterisation of mathematical naturalism as conservative is\nnot quite right: though mathematically conservative, it is philosophically\nrevolutionary.\n\n\nIn sum, scientific, mathematical, and mathematical-cum-scientific\nnaturalism are each revolutionary in some respect and face a\ncorresponding burden of proof. We may now appreciate the sense in which\nthe general claim, expressed in section 1, that naturalism is\nanti-revisionary is true and the sense in which it is not.\n\n\n\nThis also shows that contemporary naturalism is different from the\nlatter Wittgenstein's superficially similar metaphilosophy.\nWittgenstein's anti-philosophy, like naturalism, bars philosophy\nfrom changing mathematics: \u201cPhilosophy may in no way interfere\nwith the actual use of language\u2026It leaves everything as it is.\nIt also leaves mathematics as it is\u201d (1953, \u00a7163).\nNaturalism's revolutionary tenor, however, means that it does not\nleave everything as it is.\n",
