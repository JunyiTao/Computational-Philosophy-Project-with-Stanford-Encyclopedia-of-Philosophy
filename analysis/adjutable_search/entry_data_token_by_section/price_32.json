First, Price endorses\ntalk of degrees of belief (1969: 39\u201341). Second, in assessing\nthe reasonableness of someone\u2019s belief, the focus must be on the\nevidence that one possesses, not on the evidence available. According\nto Price, the notion of evidence suggests facts that are known,\nwhereas people\u2019s belief-formation can be guided by other beliefs\nthey already have, whether accurate or not. Third, because standards\nfor knowledge are high, when knowledge is unavailable,\n\u201cmere\u201d beliefs need to guide thought and action. Fourth,\ncomplex series of beliefs which support each other might be grounded\noutside themselves in at least four ways: (1) perception, (2)\nself-consciousness, (3) memory, and (4) testimony.\n\nPrice\u2019s attitude to perception as a source of belief can be\ndescribed as Moorean: the regress of the justification of belief is\nterminated by perceptual experiences and self-observation. Perception\nis simply a way to settle questions, whatever sceptical arguments\nmight be offered.\n\nPrice argues that self-consciousness gives us evidence about\nourselves: he writes, for example: \n\n\nMy evidence for believing that I am a timid person is [\u2026] the\nfrequent experiences of fear which I have noticed in myself on many\ndifferent sorts of occasions. (1969: 105)\n\n\nHe blocks scepticism about memory in ways familiar from\n \u00a72:\n sceptical problems about memory can only be generated by relying on\nmemory. A ground for scepticism will rely eventually on something\ndelivered by memory. Say you seem to remember doing something.\nYou\u2019re told that you didn\u2019t do it. Acknowledging this\nrelies on your trusting someone else\u2019s memory of what happened\n(1969: 106\u2013111). Also, to draw a conclusion from premises, one\ngenerally relies on one\u2019s memory of the premises. Thus,\narguments against memory rely on memory, so are self-undermining\n(1930b: 195\u2013196). (Bernecker 2008: 98\u201399 discusses and\nuses Price\u2019s argument; for more on memory: Price 1936:\n16\u201333; 1952c).\n\nPrice stresses how much of what each human being believes is grounded\nin testimony. However, Price argues that the following, widely\naccepted generalisation isn\u2019t well-supported: \u201cWhat there\nis said to be (or to have been) there is (or was) more often than\nnot\u201d (1969: 114). For it involves a clash in the ethics of\nbelief (1969: ch. 11; 1954b: passim): (a) that it is wrong to\nbelieve things that are not supported, and (b) that we should trust\nothers. Another approach he calls an \u201ceconomic\u201d\njustification takes the claim about others as corresponding to a\nrule (not a generalisation) to believe others unless one has\na reason not to do so (1969: 124\u2013126). Its justification is that\nunless one endorses the rule one forgoes the chance of learning about\nmost parts\u2014spatial and temporal\u2014of the world.\n\nFamously, Price (1954b: 23) opposes the ethics of belief, arguing that\nany blame directed on people\u2019s thoughts will have dire\nconsequences, such as that \u201ccharity will almost disappear from\nthe world\u201d (for discussion: Wolterstorff 2005: 326).\n \u00a74.7\n above discusses his view that we cannot simply decide to believe\nsomething (1969: 225ff, 238). However, he defends, against Newman\n(1870: ch. 6), John Locke\u2019s (1689: IV, chs. 14\u201316, 19)\nEthics of Belief (1969: 130), which in short is that we should assent\nto a degree which corresponds to the strength of our evidence for the\ntruth of the claim.\n",
