Basic Probability Operators\n\nIn this section we will study probability logics that extend the\npropositional language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) with rather basic probability\noperators. They differ from the logics in \n Section 2 \n in that\nthe logics here involve probability operators in the object language.\n Section 3.1\n discusses qualitative probability\noperators; \n Section 3.2\n discusses quantitative probability operators.\n",
