    "main_text": "Work on Tense Logic\n1. Work on Tense Logic\n\n\nPrior\u2019s most significant achievement was the invention and\ndevelopment of tense logic. Tense logic involves two new modal\noperators, \u2018It will be the case that\u2019 and \u2018It has\nbeen the case that\u2019.\n\n\nDuring the 1940s, the logic of time was in its infancy. In 1941\nFindlay briefly suggested a \u2018calculus of tenses\u2019, as\nexplained below, and in 1947 both \u0141o\u015b, in Poland, and\nReichenbach, in the United States, published limited proposals\nconcerning the logic of time (\u0141o\u015b 1947, Reichenbach 1947;\n\u0141o\u015b\u2019s paper was reviewed in English by Hi\u017c 1951;\nsee also Prior 1967a: 12\u201315, 212\u2013213, and Tkaczyk and Jarmu\u017cek\n2018). However, neither \u0141o\u015b nor Reichenbach anticipated the\ncrucial idea of using modal operators to create a formal calculus of\ntime.\n\n\nPrior catalysed the field with his detailed proposals for a modal\nlogic of time-distinctions. His tense logic was nothing less than a new\nparadigm for the study of time (Hasle and \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2016).\nPrior went on to use his tense logic to articulate theories about the\nstructure and metaphysics of time and to mount a robust defence of\nfreewill and indeterminism. Tense logic is now also employed for the\nmanipulation of time-dependent data and has numerous applications in\ncomputing, including database management, program verification, and\ncommonsense reasoning in artificial intelligence.\n",
