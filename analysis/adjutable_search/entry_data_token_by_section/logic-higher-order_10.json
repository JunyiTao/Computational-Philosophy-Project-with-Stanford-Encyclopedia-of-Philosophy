    "main_text": "Model Theory of Second-Order Logic\n7. Model Theory of Second-Order Logic\n\nLet us start by noting that there are some trivial consequences of\nsecond-order logic being able to quantify over relations. For example,\nthe Craig Interpolation Theorem holds for second-order logic for\ntrivial reasons: If the finite relational vocabulary of \\(\\phi\\) is\nL, the finite relational vocabulary of \\(\\phi'\\) is \\(L'\\) and\n\\(\\models\\phi\\to\\phi',\\) then there is \\(\\theta\\) such that\n\\(\\models\\phi\\to\\theta\\text{ and } \\models\\theta\\to\\phi'\\) and the\nvocabulary of \\(\\theta\\) is \\(L\\cap L'\\), because we can let\n\\(\\theta\\) be the sentence \\(\\exists X_1\\ldots\\exists X_n\\,\\phi\\),\nwhere \\(L\\setminus L'=\\{X_1,\\ldots, X_n\\}\\). We can additionally\ndemand that every predicate symbol occurring positively in \\(\\theta\\)\noccurs positively in \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\), and every predicate symbol\noccurring negatively in \\(\\theta\\) occurs negatively in \\(\\phi\\) and\n\\(\\psi\\) (the Lyndon Interpolation Theorem [Lyndon 1959]). In\nthe same way the Beth Definability Theorem holds for trivial reasons,\nalso some preservation\n results[7]\n have a trivial proof. For a negative result, see Craig 1965.\n\nHowever, second-order logic does not have a model theory in the same\nsense as first order logic does. There is no Compactness Theorem to\nproduce non-standard models. One reason why first order logic has such\na rich model theory is that first order logic is relatively weak.\nCountable first order theories that have infinite models have models\nof all infinite cardinalities. This is a consequence of a weakness of\nfirst order logic: its sentences cannot limit the size of the model\nunless the size is finite. In model theory this weakness is turned to\na strength: the structure of models of first order theories can be\nanalyzed in interesting ways. See the entry on\n model theory\n for examples of this.\n\nSecond-order theories can typically have just one model up to\nisomorphism. Thus if we investigate the class of models of a\nsecond-order sentence, the class may very well consist of just one\nmodel, up to isomorphism. With just one model one cannot really\ndevelop a model theory. One ends up investigating the one and only\nmodel and there are no compelling reasons to use logic in the study of\nit. If the one and only model is an algebraic structure, one should\nuse algebra to study it. If it is an ordered structure, one should use\nthe general theory of ordered structures to study it, and so on. It is\nunlikely that being second-order characterizable (see\n \u00a77.1)\n tells much about the structure. It reveals more about second-order\nlogic in general. For example, being able to characterize the\nstructure of natural numbers means that the Compactness Theorem and\nthe Completeness Theorem fail. Being able to characterize the ordered\nfield of real numbers means that both the Downward and the Upward\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorems fail. It is from this\nperspective\u2014to understand second-order logic itself\u2014that\nit is interesting to know exactly which structures are second-order\ncharacterizable up to isomorphism.\n\nLet us finally compare the two hierarchies, the model theoretic\nhierarchy \\(\\Sigma_n^1\\cup\\Pi_n^1\\) inside second-order logic and the\nLevy hierarchy \\(\\Sigma_n\\cup\\Pi_n\\) in set theory.\n\n\nTheorem 4\n\nThe set of G\u00f6del numbers of valid second-order sentences is\nthe complete \\(\\Pi_2\\)-set of natural numbers. (Tharp 1973)\nThe L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem number of second-order logic is the\nsupremum of all \\(\\Pi_2\\)-definable ordinals. (Krawczyk & Marek\n1977)\nThe Hanf number of second-order logic is the supremum of all\n\\(\\Sigma_2\\)-definable ordinals. (Krawczyk & Marek 1977)\nEvery model class which is definable in second-order logic is\n\\(\\Delta_2\\)-definable in set theory. (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen\n1979)\n\n\n\nIn the light of the above theorem second-order logic sits firmly on\nthe \\(\\Sigma_2\\cup\\Pi_2\\)-level of set theoretic definability. This is\na reason to consider second-order logic weaker than first\norder set theory. This sounds paradoxical. How can second-order logic,\nwith all the power and non-first order properties it has, be weaker\nthan first order logic based set theory, when first order logic cannot\neven express finiteness, countability, uncountability, and so on?\nNevertheless the message of\n Theorem 4\n is undeniable. Perhaps this would not be so puzzling if we thought of\nset theory as a very high order logic over the singleton of the empty\nset. After all, set theory permits endless iterations of the power set\noperation, while second-order logic permits only one iteration.\n\nWe start below with a subsection on models that can be characterized\nin second-order logic by one sentence up to isomorphism. Another\napproach to the model theory of second-order logic is to focus on\nmodels with large cardinal (inaccessible, measurable,\nsupercompact cardinals) properties. This is the topic of\n \u00a77.2.\n Finally, in\n \u00a77.3\n we consider the possibility of allowing the so-called general models\nintroduced in\n \u00a79.1.\n In this case second-order logic becomes very much like first order\nlogic. However, general models are mostly interesting when they are\nso-called Henkin models, i.e., they satisfy the so-called\nComprehension Axioms. In Henkin models second-order logic satisfies\nthe Compactness Theorem and other principles familiar from first order\nmodel theory but no general structure- or classification theory exists\nyet, perhaps because the Comprehension Axioms bring in a lot of\ncomplicated structure into the models.\n\n",
