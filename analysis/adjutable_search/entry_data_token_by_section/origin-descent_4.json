    "main_text": "The Reception of the Origin || The Professional Reception of Darwin\u2019s Theory\n3.2 The Professional Reception of Darwin\u2019s Theory\n\nOne cannot always distinguish between \u201cpopular\u201d and\n\u201cprofessional\u201d receptions of Darwin. The simplest solution\nis to confine the latter designation to those who embraced\nDarwin\u2019s version of a general theory of descent with\nmodification by people with professional research and teaching\npositions in universities and scientific societies, those who were\nintimately familiar with the empirical evidence and the technical\nscientific issues under debate in the 1860s in geology, comparative\nanatomy, embryology, biogeography, and classification theory. This\ngroup can usually be distinguished from lay interpreters who may not\nhave made distinctions between the views of Lamarck, Chambers,\nSchelling, Spencer, and Darwin on the historical development of life.\nBut this only gives a crude instrument of analysis.\n\nThe case of Ernst Haeckel displays this imprecision. He was a leading\nprofessor of zoology at an important German university (Jena), and he\nformed a generation of scientific workers in embryology and natural\nhistory who had major impact on the history of the life sciences. From\nhis position, Haeckel was able to develop Darwinism both as a popular\nmovement with social and political extensions, and also as a\nscientific research program that pursued the study of morphology and\ncomparative embryology in the light of Darwin\u2019s general theory\n(R.J. Richards 1992: chp. 6, 2008, 2013; Nyhart 1995).\n\nIf we concentrate on the reception by workers holding professional\npositions in museums, laboratories, and research and teaching\npositions in universities and membership in elite scientific\nsocieties, Darwin\u2019s reception was varied (Bowler 1996; Hull\n1973). Many prominent members of Darwin\u2019s immediate intellectual\ncircle\u2014Adam Sedgwick, William Whewell, Charles Lyell, Richard\nOwen, and Thomas Huxley\u2014had previously been highly critical of\nChambers\u2019s Vestiges in the 1840s for its speculative\ncharacter and its scientific incompetence (Secord 2000). Darwin\nhimself feared a similar reception, and he recognized the substantial\nchallenge facing him in convincing this group and the larger community\nof scientific specialists with which he interacted and corresponded\nwidely. With this group he was only partially successful.\n\nHistorical studies have revealed that only rarely did members of the\nscientific elites accept and develop Darwin\u2019s theories exactly\nas they were presented in his texts. Statistical studies on the\nreception by the scientific community in England in the first decade\nafter the publication of the Origin have shown a complicated\npicture in which there was neither wide-spread conversion of the\nscientific community to Darwin\u2019s views, nor a clear generational\nstratification between younger converts and older resisters, counter\nto Darwin\u2019s own predictions in the final chapter of the\nOrigin (Hull et al. 1978). These studies also reveal a\ndistinct willingness within the scientific community to separate\nacceptance of Darwin\u2019s more general claim of species descent\nwith modification from common ancestors from the endorsement of his\nexplanation of this descent through the action of natural selection\n(Bowler 1983, 2013a). To utilize the categories of a Lakatosian\n\u201cresearch program\u201d analysis of scientific theories in\ntheir historical extension, one can distinguish between a \u201chard\ncore\u201d of defining central assumptions, a \u201cprotective\nbelt\u201d of auxiliary hypotheses that protect this central core\nfrom refutations, and a \u201cpositive heuristic\u201d of applied\nresearch applications that are subject to continued revision and even\nrefutation (Lakatos 1970). With these distinctions in mind, it is\ndifficult to claim that anything more than the belief in descent from\ncommon ancestry was maintained by a broadly international scientific\ncommunity at the \u201chard core\u201d level in the period between\n1870\u20131930. This meant that the historical impact of\nDarwin\u2019s theories on the professional scientific community must\nconsider the important deviations from his own formulations (Bowler\n1983, 2003).\n\nOf central importance in analyzing this complex professional reception\nwas the role assigned to normal individual variation and its causes.\nIn the initial public presentation of his theory, Darwin had relied on\nthe novel claim that small individual variations\u2014the kind of\ndifferences considered by an earlier tradition as merely\n\u201caccidental\u201d\u2014formed the raw material upon which, by\nunlimited addition through the action of natural selection, major\nchanges could be produced sufficient to explain the origin and\nsubsequent differences in all the various forms of life over time.\nDarwin, however, left the specific causes of this variation unspecified beyond some effect of the environment on the sexual organs.\nVariation was presented in the Origin with the statement that\n\u201cthe laws governing inheritance are quite unknown\u201d (Darwin\n1859: 13). In keeping with his commitment to the\ngradualism of Lyellian geology, Darwin also rejected the role of major\n\u201csports\u201d or other sources of discontinuous change in this\nprocess.\n\nAs critics focused their attacks on the claim that such\nmicro-differences between individuals could be accumulated over time\nwithout natural limits, Darwin began a series of modifications and\nrevisions of the theory through a back and forth dialogue with his\ncritics that can be followed by revisions to the text of the\nOrigin. In the fourth edition of 1866, for example, Darwin\ninserted the claim that the continuous gradualism illustrated by his\nbranching diagram was misleading, and that transformative change does\nnot necessarily go on continuously. \u201cIt is far more probable\nthat each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then again\nundergoes modification\u201d (Origin 1866: 132 [Peckham 1959\n[2006: 213]). This change-stasis-change model presumably allowed\nvariation to stabilize for a period of time around a mean value from\nwhich additional change could then resume. Such a model would,\nhowever, presumably require even more time for its working than the\nmulti-millions of years assumed in the original presentation of the\ntheory.\n\nThe difficulties in Darwin\u2019s arguments that had emerged by 1866\nwere highlighted in a lengthy and telling critique in 1867 by the\nScottish engineer Henry Fleeming Jenkin (1833\u201385) (typically\nFleeming Jenkin). Using an argument previously raised in the 1830s by\nCharles Lyell against Lamarck, Fleeming Jenkin cited empirical\nevidence from domestic breeding that suggested a distinct limitation\non the degree of variation, and denied that selection upon this could\nbe taken to the extent assumed by Darwin (Fleeming Jenkin 1867; Hoquet\n2013). Using a loosely mathematical argument, Fleeming Jenkin argued\nthat the effects of intercrossing would continuously swamp deviations\nfrom the mean values of characters and result in a tendency of the\nvariation in a population to return to mean values over time. For\nFleeming Jenkin, Darwin\u2019s reliance on continuous additive\ndeviation was presumed to be undermined by this argument, and only\nmore dramatic and discontinuous change\u2014something Darwin\nexplicitly rejected\u2014could account for the origin of new\nspecies.\n\nFleeming Jenkin also argued that the time needed by Darwin\u2019s\ntheory was simply inadequate, supporting this claim by an appeal to\nthe physical calculations of the probable age of the earth presented\nin publications by Fleeming Jenkin\u2019s mentor, the Glasgow\nphysicist William Thompson (Lord Kelvin, 1824\u20131907; Burchfield,\n1975). On the basis of Thompson\u2019s quantitative physical\narguments, Fleeming Jenkin judged the time since the origin of the\nsolar system to be insufficient for the Darwinian gradualist theory of\nspecies transformation to take place. Jenkin\u2019s multi-pronged\nargument gave Darwin considerable difficulties and set the stage for\nmore detailed empirical inquiries into variation and its causes. The\ntime difficulties were only resolved in the twentieth-century with the\ndiscovery of radioactivity.\n\nAs a solution to the variation question, Darwin developed his\n\u201cprovisional hypothesis\u201d of pangenesis, which he presented\nthe year after the appearance of the Fleeming Jenkin review in his\ntwo-volume Variation of Plants and Animals Under\nDomestication (1868, second edition 1875; Olby 2013). Although\nthis theory had been formulated independently of the Jenkin review\n(Olby 1963), in effect it functioned as his reply to it. This offered\na causal theory of variation and inheritance through a return to a\ntheory resembling Buffon\u2019s theory of the organic molecules of\nthe previous century (see entry on\n evolutionary thought before Darwin\n section 3.2). Invisible material \u201cgemmules\u201d were presumed\nto exist within the cells, and according to theory, these were subject\nto possible external alteration by environment and circumstance. The\ngemmules were then shed continually into the blood stream (the\n\u201ctransport\u201d hypothesis) and assembled by \u201cmutual affinity for each other, leading to their aggregation into buds or into the sexual elements\u201d\n(Variation 1875: vol. 2: 370). In this form they were then\ntransmitted\u2014the details were not explained\u2014by sexual\ngeneration to the next generation to form the new organism out of\n\u201cunits of which each individual is composed\u201d (ibid.). In\nDarwin\u2019s view, this hypothesis united together numerous issues\ninto a coherent and causal theory of inheritance and explained the\nbasis of variation. It also explained how use-disuse inheritance, a\ntheory which Darwin never abandoned, could work.\n\nThe pangenesis theory, although not specifically referred to, seems to\nbe behind an important distinction he inserted into the fifth edition\nof the Origin of 1869 where he made a direct reply to the\ncriticisms of Jenkin. In this textual revision, Darwin distinguished\n\u201ccertain variations, which no one would\nrank as mere individual differences\u201d, from ordinary variations\n(Origin 1869: 105) [Peckham 1959\n[2006: 178\u2013179]]). This revision shifted Darwin\u2019s emphasis\naway from his early reliance on normal slight individual variation,\nand gave new status to what he termed by the sixth edition of 1872 \u201cstrongly\nmarked\u201d variations. The latter were now the form of variation to\nbe given primary evolutionary significance, and presumably this was\nmore likely to be transmitted to the offspring, although details are\nleft unclear. In this form it presumably could be maintained in a\npopulation against the tendency to swamping by intercrossing.\nDarwin\u2019s struggles over this issue defined a set of problems\nthat British life scientists in particular were to deal with into the\n1930s. The debates over variation placed Darwinism in a defensive\nposture that forced its supporters into major revisions in the\nDarwinian research program (Gayon 1998; Vorzimmer 1970). The long\nperiod between 1870 and 1930, sometimes characterized as the\n\u201cEclipse\u201d of Darwinism, or at least of his natural\nselection theory, was the outcome of these debates (Bowler 1983,\n2013a).\n",
