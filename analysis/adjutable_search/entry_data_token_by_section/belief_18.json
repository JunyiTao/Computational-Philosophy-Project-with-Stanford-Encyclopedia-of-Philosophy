    "main_text": "The Content of Beliefs || Frege\u2019s Puzzle\n4. Can There Be Belief Without Language?\n\nSome philosophers have argued that beings without language, notably\nhuman infants and non-human animals, cannot have beliefs. The most\ninfluential case for this view has been Davidson\u2019s (1982, 1984;\nHeil 1992). Three primary arguments in favor of the necessity of\nlanguage for belief can be extracted from Davidson.\n\nThe first starts from the observation that if we are to ascribe a\nbelief to a being without language\u2014a dog, say, who is barking up\na tree into which a squirrel has just run\u2014we must ascribe a\nbelief with some particular content. At first blush, it seems natural\nto say that, in the case described, the dog believes that the squirrel\nis in the tree. However, on reflection, that attribution may seem to\nbe not quite right. The dog does not really have the concept of a\nsquirrel or a tree in the human sense. The dog may not know, for\ninstance, that trees have roots and require water to grow.\nConsequently, according to Davidson, it is not really accurate to say\nthat the dog believes that the squirrel is in the\ntree (at least in the de dicto sense: see \u00a73.3\nabove). However, Davidson argues, neither does the dog have any\nother particular belief. Embracing holism (see \u00a73.2\nabove), Davidson asserts that to have a belief with a specific\ncontent, that belief must be embedded in a rich network of other\nbeliefs with specific contents, but a dog\u2019s cognitive life is\nnot complex enough to support such a network. \u201cBelief\u201d\ntalk thus cannot get traction (cf. Dennett 1969; Stich 1979,\n1983).\n\nSeveral philosophers (e.g., Routley 1981; Smith 1982; Allen 1992;\nGlock 2010) have objected to this argument on the grounds that the\ndog\u2019s cognition about things such as trees, while perhaps not\nmuch like ours, is nonetheless relatively rich, involving a number of\nelements relatively neglected by us, such as their scent and their use\nin marking territory. The dog\u2019s understanding of a tree may be\nat least as rich as the human understanding of some objects about\nwhich we seem to have beliefs. For example, it seems that a chemically\nuntrained person may believe that boron is a chemical element without\nknowing very much about boron apart from that fact. Since we have no\nlanguage for doggy concepts, our belief ascriptions to dogs can only\nbe approximate\u2014but if one accepts holism, then belief ascription\nto other human beings may be similarly approximate.\n\nDavidson also argues that to have a belief one must have the\nconcept of belief, which involves the ability to recognize\nthat beliefs can be false or that there is a mind-independent reality\nbeyond one\u2019s beliefs; and that these abilities require language.\nHowever, Davidson offers little explicit support for this claim.\nFurthermore, many developmental psychologists have suggested that\nchildren do not understand the appearance-reality distinction and do\nnot recognize that beliefs can be false until they are at least three\nyears old (Perner 1991; Wellman, Cross, and Watson 2001; though see\nSouthgate, Senju, and Csibra 2007; Scott and Baillargeon 2017).\nDavidson\u2019s view thus requires him either to reject this\nempirical thesis or embrace the seemingly implausible view that\ntwo-year-olds have no beliefs (see also Andrews 2002).\n\nThe view that belief requires language is a natural consequence of the\nview that belief attribution is inextricably intertwined with the\ninterpretation of a subject\u2019s linguistic utterances. Davidson,\nas described above (\u00a71.3), argues that the interpretation of\ncreature\u2019s beliefs, desires, and its language must come\ntogether as a package. This provides a third Davidsonian reason for\nrejecting belief without language (a reason that, however, remains\nlargely implicit in Davidson): Creatures without language are missing\npart of what is essential to a behavioral pattern of the sort that can\nunderwrite proper belief ascription (and recall that on an\ninterpretational view, all there is to having a belief is having a\npattern of behavior that is interpretable in that way to an outside\nobserver). Any view that ties belief attribution and the\nsubject\u2019s language as closely together as Davidson\u2019s\ndoes\u2014Sellars (1956, 1969), Brandom (1994), and Wettstein (2004)\nalso offer views of this sort\u2014will have difficulty accommodating\nthe possibility of belief in creatures without language. Thus,\nwhatever draws us to such views will also provide reason to deny\nbelief (or at least robust, full-blown belief) to languageless\ncreatures.\n\nPositive arguments for attributing beliefs to (at least) human infants\nand non-linguistic mammals have tended to focus on the general\nbiological and behavioral similarity between adult human beings, human\ninfants, and non-human mammals; the naturalness of describing the\nbehavior of infants and non-linguistic mammals in terms of their\nbeliefs and desires; and the difficulty of usefully characterizing\ntheir mental lives without relying on the ascription of propositional\nattitudes (e.g., Routley 1981; Marcus 1995; Allen and Bekoff 1997;\nZimmerman 2018; Curry forthcoming).\n",
