    "main_text": "Is Equality Desirable Per Se? Alternatives to Egalitarianism || Other Views\n6.4 Other Views\n\n\nJust about any moral principles might require moves toward equality\nof some sort across persons in some actual, likely, or conceivable\ncircumstances. Utilitarianism says that one ought always to do whatever\nwould maximize aggregate welfare. In some circumstances doing that\nwould require working especially hard to boost the welfare of the\ndisadvantaged, and so to bring about a state of affairs that is closer\nto equality of welfare than would otherwise have come about. Sometimes\nin order to maximize aggregate welfare one would need to transfer\nincome or wealth from rich to poor, and thus bring about a closer\napproximation to the state of affairs in which all persons have the\nsame income or wealth or both. A Lockean natural rights view holds that\none is always bound by a strict moral duty to respect everyone's\nnatural rights, come what may. It might be that in some circumstances\ndoing what brings about greater equality of some sort across persons\nwould be a good means to bringing it about that one respects the\nnatural rights of other people that morality says one ought to respect.\nIn other situations increasing equality might be a byproduct of the\ncourse of action that one is morally obliged to take, according to\nLockean morality, in order to respect people's natural\nrights.\n\n\nIt should be clear that even if some contingent connections of these\nsorts hold between promoting equality and acting in conformity with\nsome quite different moral view whose best articulation contains no\nessential reference to equality promotion, the quite different moral\nview is not thereby revealed to be egalitarian. At the outset of this\nsurvey broad and narrow egalitarianism were distinguished. The former\nsays equality is at least instrumentally valuable and should be\npromoted; the latter says equality is non-instrumentally valuable and\nshould on that ground be promoted. To show that some moral doctrine\nsupports broad egalitarianism one would need to show not just that the\nview might conceivably, given some logically possible circumstances,\nsupport the claim that equality of some sort should be promoted, but\nrather that given the world as it is and is likely to be, the doctrine\nin question is often or usually or always aligned with broad\negalitarianism.\n\n\nSufficiency, priority, and desert are rivals of narrow\negalitarianism. Advocates of each of these views have argued that the\nrival often supports equalization, and so one might mistakenly support\nequalization on the ground that equality of some sort is\nnon-instrumentally valuable. But once one examines a broader sample of\nexamples, and reviews situations in which the rival and narrow\negalitarianism yield opposed recommendations as to what should be done,\none should conclude that the rival, and not any version of narrow\negalitarianism, should be affirmed as non-instrumentally valuable and\nincorporated into the set of fundamental moral principles. Or so the\nadvocates of the rivals will say.\n\n\nTo defend the position that equality is per se morally desirable one\nwould need carefully to investigate the scenarios in which egalitarian\ntransfers are attractive and the variety of principles that would\nsupport egalitarian transfers in those scenarios. If the norm of\nequality does not match our considered judgments after wide reflection,\nwe should be content to be instrumental egalitarians if we are\ndetermined to be egalitarians at all.\n\n7. Egalitarian Standards for Institutions and Individual\nConduct\n\n\nEgalitarian principles might apply only to individual conduct, only\nto institutions, to both, or neither. The same principles might apply\nto individual conduct and institutions, or it could be that different\nprinciples apply in each domain.\n\n\nOne reason for supposing that more demanding egalitarian principles\napply to the enactment of laws and public policies and to the conduct\nof states than to individual conduct is that the reasons to insist that\nthe state choose its actions according to impartial standards, treating\nall citizens impartially, are stronger than the reasons to insist that\nindividuals in private life should choose actions according to\nimpartial standards, treating all fellow citizens who might be affected\nby one's choices impartially. In private life, an individual is\npermitted to favor herself over others. An individual is also permitted\nto favor her own friends and family members over other people in many\ncontexts (not when she is an employer selecting who among those who\nhave applied for a job should be selected for employment, nor is she\npermitted to offer goods and services for sale to some while refusing\nto sell these same commodities to others). Individuals are thought to have wide discretion\nto pursue their own projects in their own way. In contrast, the state\nis widely supposed to be entitled to favor the interests of its\ncitizens living with its jurisdiction over the interests of noncitizens\nliving outside its jurisdiction, but is required to be strictly\nimpartial in treating citizens. In the words of Ronald Dworkin, the\nstate is obliged to treat all citizens with equal concern and\nrespect.\n\n\nThe considerations advanced in the previous paragraph could be given\na stronger or a weaker interpretation. On the stronger reading, the\nprinciples that determine morally acceptable state actions have no\nimplications for what individuals should do in private life. The\nprinciples for state action might in principle be entirely separate and\ndistinct from the principles that determine morally acceptable\nindividual conduct. On the weaker reading, the principles that regulate\nstate action might have implications for what individuals should do in\ntheir private as well as public roles and might partially determine the\nstandards regulating individual conduct. Nonetheless individuals\ngenerally should have greater permission to deviate from strict\nimpartiality in deciding how to act when their actions could help\nothers than states should have.\n\n\nEven those sympathetic to the position just outlined are likely to\nacknowledge the position must be qualified and hedged in some ways.\nConsider racial discrimination. Suppose we hold that the state should\nnot engage in discriminatory conduct on the basis of racial\nclassifications even to advance morally worthy goals\u2014imagine that\nin some circumstances guiding police behavior by racial profiling would\nbe a cost-effective measure to reduce crime. The reasons we hold it is\nwrong for the state to engage in racial discrimination would appear to\ncarry over to private discriminatory behavior by citizens. It would be\nwrongful racial discrimination to choose my friends according to their\nrace or skin color. Private action by individuals that expresses hatred\nof people on grounds of their race or skin color is wrong for pretty\nmuch the same reasons that it would be wrong for a state to pass and\nenforce laws and public policies that express hatred of people on\ngrounds of their race or skin color.\n\n\nTo illustrate some of the complexities of determining how\negalitarian principles regulating state action and egalitarian\nprinciples regulating individual conduct might be related, consider\nJohn Rawls's view that the primary subject of justice is the\nbasic structure of society\u2014core institutions including the state,\nprivate ownership and the market economy, and the family as they\ninteract and affect people's fundamental life prospects. Rawls\ndevises a special argument designed to generate principles for the\nregulation of the basic structure of society that we, contemplating\nthis argument, should accept as principles that determine what must be\ntrue if the basic structure is to qualify as just. The special argument\ndevice, which Rawls calls the \u201coriginal position,\u201d is also\ndeployed to select principles of individual conduct associated with the\nprinciples of justice, but these principles merely state that\nindividuals should support just institutions. When the basic structure\nof society is just, individuals should support it and conform to its\nnorms and rules, and if the basic structure is not just individuals\nshould cooperate with others to bring about a just basic structure so\nlong as they can do so at moderate cost and risk to themselves (Rawls\n1999, chapters 2 and 3).\n\n\nFor purposes of examining the relationship between requirements on\nindividuals and requirements on institutions in a theory of justice, I\nshall simplify Rawls's theory and suppose it simply mandates that\nthe basic structure institutions should be arranged so that the primary\nsocial good holdings of the worst off sector of society are maximized.\n(As is well known, Rawls's theory also includes a principle of\nequal liberty that mandates that a fully adequate scheme of civil and\npolitical liberties be secured for all and a principle of fair equality\nof opportunity that requires that inequalities in primary social good\nholdings be attached to positions and offices open to all in such a way\nthat those with equal ambition and equal native talent have equal\nchances of being competitively successful. These principles take\nlexical priority over the difference principle [Rawls 1999, chapters\n2\u20134]).\n\n\nThere is undoubtedly a certain appeal to the strategy of holding the\nlegal, coercive structure of legal rules to be the entity that delivers\ndistributive justice according to the difference principle. The laws\nincluding laws regulating contract, property, torts, and family are set\nso that, as compared to any alternative set of rules that might be\nchosen, they work to maximize the long-run primary social good holdings\nof the people who have least of these. In private life, and carrying out\nprivate decisions within the institutions regulated by the coercive\nrules, the individual citizen has complete liberty to act according to\nher own values and preferences so long as she obeys the legal rules\nthat apply to her. The strategy reflects a balance of liberty and\nequality (Nagel 1991).\n\n\nThe adoption of the strategy also reflects the view that the\ncoercively imposed basic structure of society including its political\nconstitution must be acceptable to all reasonable persons in a diverse\nsociety in which reasonable people disagree widely in their\ncomprehensive conceptions of the right and the good. Since any attempt\nto impose egalitarian norms on individual economic choices would be\nunavoidably controversial and socially divisive, the just society\neschews the attempt, on principle (Scheffler 2010, chapter 5).\n\n\nIn several of his writings G. A. Cohen has mounted an attack on the\nRawlsian position that the basic structure is the primary subject of\njustice and that beyond supporting just institutions individuals are\nnot morally required to pursue justice goals including the difference\nprinciple in their choices of how to live (Cohen 2000 and 2008, see\nalso Murphy 1998). In a nutshell, Cohen objects that in a society in which\npeople and institutions are just according to Rawls's standards,\nthe people endorse the difference principle: they believe institutions\nshould be set to make the condition of the worst off in primary goods\nholdings as good as it can be made. However, their own actions,\nindividually and in the ensemble, will have an impact on the condition\nof the least advantaged members of society. Hence their acceptance of\nthe difference principle ought to have implications for the conduct of\ntheir lives. Grant that each person is free to live as she chooses, to\nsome extent, without being required in every action to do her utmost to\nbring about the fullest realization of social justice in the universe.\nEach person has a legitimate personal prerogative to do actions that\nproduce less than the best outcome within certain moral limits\n(Scheffler 1982). But the prerogative gives out, and where it does, if\none is committed to the difference principle, one will make decisions\nconcerning work and career that will aim to improve the condition of\nthe worst off. Suppose one holds instead that justice requires an equal\ndistribution of benefits and burdens among the members of society,\nexcept when inequality arises in a way for which the person who ends up\nwith less should properly be held responsible (Cohen 2008). Then also,\none will, to some considerable extent, shape one's economic\nbehavior with this egalitarian aim in view, if one is seriously\ncommitted to the idea that justice demands equality.\n\n\nIf justice is a fair distribution of benefits and burdens across\npeople, and if one's economic behavior affects the degree to\nwhich justice obtains, then if one is committed to justice, one must,\nto some degree, guide one's behavior by that commitment. So Cohen\nurges. He complains that Rawls countenances a split in the thinking and\naction of the just individual in an imagined fully just society that\ndoes not make sense. The Rawlsian just individual supports the\ndifference principle as the regulative standard for institutions, for\nthe basic structure of society, but does not regulate his own life\nchoices in daily economic affairs and career choices by the difference\nprinciple. Cohen objects that this split personality cannot be an\nideally just person, contrary to what Rawls claims (Rawls 1999).\nAccording to Cohen a fully just society regulated by egalitarian\nprinciples would include an egalitarian ethos that instructs\nindividuals that each should do her bit towards sustaining equality by\nher everyday choices. Individuals internalize the egalitarian ethos and\nare guided by it in their economic choices, and hence will not be\ndisposed to bargain hard for extra pay and benefits in exchange for\nmaking efficient contributions to the economy. They will rather be\ndisposed to cooperate with others efficiently in their economic\ninteractions without requiring the spur of economic incentives. In this\nway a thoroughly just Rawlsian society populated by just individuals\nachieves more egalitarian outcomes while maximizing the benefits that\ngo to the worst off than a Rawlsian society regulated in the split\npersonality fashion. (Cohen also challenges Rawls's argument for\nthe difference principle. Cohen claims that Rawls starts with a\nconsideration favoring equality that illicitly gets dropped as his\ndiscussion proceeds. Cohen then holds that Rawls, and we, should\nbelieve that justice requires equality, even if pragmatic nonjustice\ngrounds favor the difference principle, which does not incorporate the\nidea that equality is non-instrumentally morally valuable. (See Cohen\n2008, chapter 4). But in the argument being considered here, Cohen\naccepts the difference principle arguendo, and argues that Rawls does\nnot fully acknowledge the implications of his own commitment to\nit.)\n\n\nA Rawlsian rejoinder to Cohen might point out that the principles of\njustice including the difference principle are principles for the\nregulation of the basic structure of society. Accepting the difference\nprinciple as a standard for institutional arrangements is not\ntantamount to accepting the difference principle as a guide to\none's personal life. Cohen insists this position is unstable.\nRawls holds that the basic structure of society is the primary subject\nof justice because its effects on people's fundamental life\nprospects are so deep and widespread. But voluntary choices of\nindividuals within institutions such as the economy and the family also\nmassively shape people's fundamental life prospects. According to\nCohen, the rationale for taking the basic structure to be the primary\nsubject of justice is also a rationale for taking people's\nchoices within the basic structure to be incorporated in the primary\nsubject of justice. Perhaps the principles of justice in their\napplication to individuals take a somewhat different form than they do\nin their application to institutions. Recall here Cohen's\nacceptance of the idea that each individual has a Scheffler prerogative\nto pursue her own projects and aims, to some extent, and not always to\nbe acting with a view to promoting justice. But Cohen's bottom\nline is that if justice requires the promotion of a moral goal,\nacceptance of that moral goal as a requirement of justice by the\nindividual must commit her to acting in her own life with a view to\npromoting that goal.\n\n\nSeveral issues arise in considering Cohen versus Rawls. According to\nRawls, a just society is a fair scheme of cooperation among persons\nregarded as free and equal. Each is free in having the ability and the\nright to develop and pursue a conception of the good and also the\nability and the disposition to cooperate with others on fair terms. In\nany modern, diverse society that refrains from clearly unacceptable\nrestriction of freedom, individuals will develop allegiance to\ndifferent and opposed conceptions of the right and the good, and a\nconception of justice that can elicit everyone's reasonable\nacceptance must be acceptable to the different reasonable ethical views\nthat individuals espouse. The moral equality of persons generates this\nunanimity requirement. To satisfy this requirement, a justice doctrine\nmust be built up from ideas deeply embedded in the culture of modern\ndemocracies. To enable satisfaction of this requirement, reasonable\ncitizens do not press as justice norms controversial, sectarian\ndoctrines that some cannot reasonably accept. When we act together as\ncitizens through the state, we act on the basis of shared reasons, a\ncommon ideal of justice. But each of us has different ultimate ethical\nallegiances, and no single idea of what demands morality places on us\nto promote justice in our private conduct will make sense to all of us.\nMoreover, it would be a form of tyranny to require that we generally\nact only on the shared reasons of justice throughout our lives rather\nthan on the aims and ambitions that are uniquely our own. In a just\nsociety, individuals in their daily lives will decide from their own\nindividual ethical perspectives what goals to pursue, including justice\ngoals, within constraints set by the rights of others. There is no\nsocial consensus on this issue, so no particular view of the demands of\njustice promotion in ordinary life will be part of a conception of\njustice that all can accept (see generally Rawls 2005).\n\n\nThe defender of the Cohen side of this debate will insist that\nreasonable people can make mistakes, so the fact, if it is a fact, that\nany particular view of the positive duties to promote justice and\nequality in daily life that we should accept will fail to gain\nunanimous support does not necessarily impugn the particular view. Some\nsuch view may be correct though controversial. Also, the egalitarian\nethos with its demands on individual daily conduct is not supposed to\nbe legally enforceable, rather it is supposed to be a social norm\nbacked by informal sanctions and rational persuasion. Still, justice\ndemands an egalitarian ethos, and individual conduct in conformity with\nit. So the defender of the Cohen position will hold. This is a tricky\nissue. It may be difficult to determine to what extent Cohenites and\nRawlsians are in substantial disagreement, as opposed to arguing past\neach other. It may be still more difficult to determine which side (if\neither one) is right on the points that substantially divide them.\n\n\nStepping back from the Cohen versus Rawls polemic (on which, see\nWilliams 1998, Pogge 2000, Scheffler 2006, and Shiffrin 2010), we\nshould note that any theory of egalitarian justice must indicate how\nits requirements for institutions and practices mesh with its views\nconcerning what justice requires of individuals. For example, any\nordinary person seeking to fashion a fulfilling life for himself will\nform friendships and close family ties and other associations that will\ncommand his loyalty. Being a good friend, one will be partial to\none's friend over others in some contexts; being a good family\nmember, one will be partial to one's family members over others;\nbeing a good citizen, one will (perhaps, this case is more\ncontroversial) have a special loyalty to one's compatriots. These\nspecial-tie commitments appear to be unavoidably in tension with any\ncommitment to any impartial justice norms (Scheffler 2003). Suppose we\naccept the idea that the person committed to egalitarianism will not\nseek to expunge all personal commitments from her life but will seek to\naccommodate impartial ethical and partial concerns in some way that does\njustice to both. What way is that? Presumably the answer will vary\nacross the different types of personal commitments that might lead one\nto do what cuts against justice requirements. Relations to colleagues,\nfamily members, friends, lovers, parents, children, ethnic and social\ngroup comrades, and so on will pose different sorts of problems that\nwill require different sorts of accommodations and adjustments. A\ncomplete egalitarian theory includes principles that would properly\nguide these accommodations and adjustments. (For an attempt to work out\nthese issues for one domain, that of parents and children, from a\nperspective sympathetic to Cohen's line, see Brighouse and Swift\n2009).\n",
