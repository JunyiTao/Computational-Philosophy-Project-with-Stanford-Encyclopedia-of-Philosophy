    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Divine Power\n2.2 Divine Power\n\nLike all scholastics since the early thirteenth century, James\nsubscribes to the distinction between God\u2019s ordained power,\naccording to which \u201cGod can only do what he preordained he would\ndo according to wisdom and will\u201d (Quodl. I, q. 2, p.\n17, 35\u201337) and his absolute power, according to which he can do\nwhatever is \u201cdoable,\u201d i.e., whatever does not imply a\ncontradiction. Problems concerning what God can or cannot do arise\nonly in the latter case. James considers several questions: can God\nadd an infinite number of created species to the species already in\nexistence (Quodl. I, q. 2)? Can he make matter exist without\nform (Quodl. IV, q. 1)? Can he make an accident subsist\nwithout a substrate (Quodl. II, q. 1)? Can he create the\nseminal reason of a rational soul in matter (Quodl. III, q.\n10)? In response to the first question, James explains, following\nGiles of Rome but against the opinion of Godfrey of Fontaines and\nHenry of Ghent, that God can by his absolute power add an infinite\nnumber of created species ad superius, in the ascending order\nof perfection, if not in actuality, then at least in potency. God\ncannot, however, add even one additional species of reality ad\ninferius, between prime matter and pure nothingness, not because\nthis exceeds his power but because prime matter is contiguous to\nnothingness and leaves, so to speak, no room for God to exercise his\npower (C\u00f4t\u00e9 2009). James is more hesitant about the\nsecond question. He is sympathetic both to the arguments of those who\ndeny that God can make matter subsist independently of form and to the\narguments of those who claim he can. Both positions can reasonably be\nheld, because each argues from a different (and valid) perspective.\nProponents of the first position argue from the point of view of\nreason: because they rightly believe that God cannot make what implies\na contradiction, and because they believe (rightly or wrongly) that\nmaking matter exist without form does involve a contradiction, they\nconclude that God cannot make matter exist without form. Proponents of\nthe second group argue from the perspective of God\u2019s omnipotence\nwhich transcends human reason: because they rightly assume that\nGod\u2019s power exceeds human comprehension, they conclude (rightly\nor wrongly) that making matter exist without form is among those\nthings exceeding human comprehension that God can make come to\npass.\n\nAnother question James considers is whether God can make an accident\nsubsist without a subject or substrate. The question arises only with\nrespect to what he calls \u201cabsolute accidents,\u201d namely\nquantity and quality, as opposed to relational accidents\u2014the\nremaining categories of accident. God clearly cannot make relational\naccidents exist without a subject in which they inhere, for this would\nentail a contradiction. This is so because relations for James, as we\nwill see in\n section 3.3\n below, are modes, not things. What about absolute accidents? As a\nCatholic theologian, James is committed to the view that some\nquantities and qualities can subsist without a subject, for instance\nextension and color, a view for which he attempts to provide a\nphilosophical justification. His position, in a nutshell, is that\naccidents are capable of existing independently if they are thing-like\n(dicunt rem). Numbers, place (locus), and time are\nnot thing-like and are thus not capable of independent existence;\nextension, however, is and so can be made to exist without a subject.\nThe same reasoning applies to quality. This is somewhat surprising,\nfor according to the traditional account of the Eucharist, whereas\nextension may exist without a subject, the qualities, color, odor,\ntexture, necessarily cannot; they inhere in the extension. James,\nhowever, holds that just as God can make thing-like quantities to\nexist without a subject, so too must he be able to make a thing-like\nquality exist without the subject in which it inheres. Just which\nqualities are capable of existing without a subject is determined by\nwhether or not they are \u201cmodes of being,\u201d i.e., by whether\nor not they are relational. This seems to be the case with health and\nshape: health is a proportion of the humors, and so, relational;\nlikewise, shape is related to parts of quantity, without which,\ntherefore, it cannot exist. Colors and weight, by contrast, are\nnon-relational, according to James, and are thus in principle capable\nof being made to exist without a subject.\n\nThe fourth question James considers in relation to God\u2019s\nomnipotence raises the interesting problem of whether the rational\nsoul can come from matter. James proceeds carefully, claiming not to\nprovide a definitive solution but merely to investigate the issue\n(non determinando sed investigando). The upshot of the\ninvestigation is that although there are many good reasons (the\nsoul\u2019s immortality, its spirituality and its per se\nexistence) to say that God cannot produce the seminal reason of the\nrational soul in matter, in the end, James decides, with the help of\nAugustine, that such a possibility must be open to God. Thus, it is\ntrue in the order which God has de facto instituted, that the\nsoul\u2019s incorruptibility is repugnant to matter, but this is not\nso in absolute terms: if God can miraculously cause something to come\nto existence through generation and confer immortality upon it (James\nis presumably thinking of Christ), then he can make it come to pass\nthat souls are produced through generation without being subject to\ncorruption. Likewise, although it appears inconceivable that something\nmaterial could generate something endowed with per se\nexistence, it is not impossible absolutely speaking: if God can confer\nseparate existence upon an accident\u2014despite the fact that\naccidents naturally inhere in their substrates\u2014then, in like\nmanner, he can confer separate existence upon a soul, although it has\na seminal reason in matter.\n",
