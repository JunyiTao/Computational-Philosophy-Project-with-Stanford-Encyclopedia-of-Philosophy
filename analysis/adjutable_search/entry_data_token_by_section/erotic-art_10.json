    "main_text": "Erotic Art vs Pornography: Beyond Aesthetics || Erotic Art, Feminist Theory, and Objectification\n5. Further questions\n\nMany more philosophical questions remain to be examined in relation to\nerotic art. The following will likely play an important role in future\nresearch on this topic. First, what exactly does it mean for a\nrepresentation to be voyeuristic and what, if anything, is the\ndifference between voyeurism in artistic and non-artistic\nrepresentations? The question was already raised in John\nBerger\u2019s classic Ways of Seeing (1972) and has since\nthen been addressed in Schellekens 2012 and Eaton 2012. The latter\nalso offers a philosophical re-interpretation of the influential but\nstrongly psychoanalytically informed concept of the \u201cmale\ngaze\u201d (Mulvey 1989). To say that a work embodies the male gaze,\nEaton submits, is simply to say that it prescribes that its audience\nperceives the woman represented as primarily a sex object. As such,\nthe tradition of the female nude in Western art promotes sexually\nobjectifying, heteronormative erotic taste, and thereby has insidious\neffects on gender equality. Following on from this, Lavallee (2016)\nargues that Eaton\u2019s thesis is mainly based on the experiences of\nwhite women and does not pay adequate attention to the lives of\nnonwhite women. This act of exclusion exposes a more general bias in\ndiscussions of female representations in art. Different kinds of\nbodies have been subjected to different kinds of objectifying\nconstrual. Lavallee therefore suggests that the ethics of nudity in\nart must be extended to take such variation into account (see also\nTaylor 2016, especially chapter 4).\n\nSecond, what is the role of transgression in erotic art? While\nfeminist philosophers have rightly highlighted the moral dangers\ninvolved in the production and dissemination of sexual imagery, other\nphilosophers and most notably Georges Bataille (1985, 1986), have\nargued that norm-breaking, and in particular the violation of social\nor moral norms about sexual behavior, is indispensable for sexual\narousal and provides a basis for other affective states, such as\ndisgust, humor, and awe, which are often in play in sexual encounters\nand representations. (For a demystified and less radical version of\nthis argument, see Newall 2012. For a general discussion of the role\nof transgression in art, see Julius 2002).\n\nThird, how does the degree of eroticism of a work of erotic art relate\nto its goodness as art, and how do the criteria for assessing erotic\nart differ from those appropriate to assessing art of other sorts? By\nreflecting on the appreciation and artistic status of art with a\nnon-artistic primary intended function, such as religious, political\nor erotic art, Davies (2012) makes a good start in answering these\nquestions.\n\nFourth, there are interesting differences between art forms that are\nworth investigating. For instance, philosophical discussions of erotic\nart have often focused on visual art or literature. But Benovsky\n(2021) draws attention to erotic experiences qua proprioceptive\nexperiences and defends the claim that, under the right circumstances,\nsuch experiences can bring about proprioceptive artworks. Adil Mustafa\nAhmad notes in relation to Islamic art that\n\n\npractically all that is perceived as erotic (acceptable, sublime) when\ndescribed in literature is seen as pornographic (off-putting and\nvulgar) if projected in painting and sculpture. (Ahmad 1994: 281)\n\n\nIn Western art, too, there appear to be different degrees of\npermissibility if one compares literature with the visual arts. How to\nexplain this? How to explain, furthermore, the absence, or\nnear-absence, of the genre of erotic art in what are sometimes called\nthe non-representational arts? There seems to be very little erotic\narchitecture and it is not entirely clear whether there is any\nabsolute music that qualifies as erotic. There are erotic dances, of\ncourse, but these are rarely performed within an art context or\nconsidered as art works.\n\nTo illuminate the latter phenomenon it might be helpful to reflect on\nissues of fictionality and imagination\u2014a fifth important\nresearch strand. As Cain Todd (2012) argues, the awareness of\nfictionality of sexual representations ensures that one\u2019s\nimaginative engagement implies merely imagined\n\u201cdesire-like\u201d states, whereas the voyeuristic appreciation\nof a stripper\u2019s erotic dance seems to preclude this sort of\nengagement, and in virtue of doing so, involves real sexual desire.\nOne might think that, characteristically, arousal-directed imagining\ntowards a sexual representation is de se in that one uses the\nimage as a prop to imagine committing or witnessing certain sexual\nacts and, indeed, Todd argues that the engagement with sexual imagery\ncan possess certain cognitive values, insofar as it involves the self\nin de se imaginative projects. But notwithstanding the\napparent plausibility of such claims, this is denied by Stock (2012)\nwho argues that enjoying erotica does not always involve imagining\nsomething about oneself.\n\nSixth, if erotic art and pornography are not mutually exclusive, why\nis there not more art that qualifies as both? Van Brabandt and Prinz\n(2012) address this question in relation to cinema. Despite the many\nresemblances between art films and pornographic films\u2014jump cuts,\nlong takes, \u201cBrechtian\u201d acting, a cinema\nv\u00e9rit\u00e9-like grittiness, arousal of strong emotions, an\nexploration of the extremes of human experience and of the margins of\nsociety\u2014they argue that market forces are mainly to be blamed\nfor the lack of overlap between the two. Mari Mikkola (2013), by\ncontrast, builds on recent work in the ontology of artifacts to\nspeculate about the possibility of porno-art\u2014a new class of\nobjects growing out of the extant categories of pornography and art,\nwithout being reducible to either one.\n\nSeventh, obscenity and censorship issues will continue to play a key\npart in research on erotic art. They crop up in philosophical\ndiscussions of the nude (Nead 1992; Hammer 1997; Danto 2000; Scruton\n2009) and of art that challenges the classical ideal of beauty\n(O\u2019Hear 1991, Danto 1995, Mey 2007). They are also central to\nstipulative distinctions between erotic art and pornography\n(Maes 2012). George P. Elliott, for instance, defines pornography\nas\n\n\nthe representation of directly or indirectly erotic acts with an\nintrusive vividness which offends decency without aesthetic\njustification. (1970: 74\u201375)\n\n\nA normative definition of this kind will bring to mind certain legal\ndescriptions of obscenity such as the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s\nnotorious Miller test, set forth in Miller v. California\n(1973). This test proposed a three-pronged criterion for obscenity:\nx is obscene if (1) it is found appealing to the prurient\ninterest by an average person applying contemporary community\nstandards, (2) it depicts sexual conduct, specifically defined by the\napplicable state law, in a patently offensive way and (3) taken as a\nwhole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific\nvalue. The Miller test has proved problematic in many respects, one of\nits most evident flaws being the conflation of two ideas\u2014the\npornographic and the obscene (Nussbaum 2004). Recent philosophical\nattempts to define the obscene have avoided this\nmistake\u2014allowing for non-pornographic obscenities and obscene\nerotic art (e.g., Kieran 2002).\n\nFinally, if erotic representations and art works help to shape how we\nsee and engage with bodies, how can they be mobilised to challenge (or\nperpetuate) oppression based on race, sexual orientation, age, size,\nand disability? Audre Lorde\u2019s \u201cUses of the Erotic\u201d\n(1978) has been a seminal text. But while Davidson (2016), Cahill\n(2016), Lintott & Irvin (2016), Mikkola (ed., 2017) and\nThorneycroft (2021) offer some recent perspectives, much more work\nstill needs to be done on this front.\n\nIn sum, it will be clear that any serious thinking about erotic art\nleads to fundamental questions about the nature of aesthetics, the\nmoral impact and status of representations, and the boundaries of art.\nAs such there can be little doubt that this topic will prove to be\nfruitful for further philosophical investigation.\n",
