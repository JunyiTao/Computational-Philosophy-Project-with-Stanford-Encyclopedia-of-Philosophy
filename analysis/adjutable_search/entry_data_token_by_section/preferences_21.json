    "main_text": "Preference change || Valuational preference change\n7.4 Valuational preference change\n\nIf an agent forms a specific preference as a result of some\nexperience, further changes in her overall preference state are often\nnecessary to regain consistency. A model of preference change can\ntherefore be constructed as an input-output model in the same style as\nstandard models of belief change. (Hansson 1995, Liu 2011) Changes in\npreference are triggered by inputs that are represented by sentences\nexpressing new preference patterns. Hence, if the subject grows tired\nof her previous favourite brand of mustard, \\(A\\), and starts to like\nbrand \\(C\\) better, then this will be represented by a change with the\nsentence \u201c\\(C\\) is better than \\(A\\)\u201d, in formal language\n\\(C\\succ A\\), as an input. However, a change in which the previous\npreference \\(A\\succ C\\) is replaced by the new preference \\(C\\succ A\\)\ncan take place in different ways. For instance, there may be a third\nbrand \\(B\\) that was previously placed between \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) in the\npreference ordering.  The instruction to make the new preference\nrelation satisfy \\(C\\succ A\\) does not tell us where \\(B\\) should be\nplaced in the new ordering. The new ordering may for instance be\neither \\(C\\succ A\\succ B\\) or \\(C\\succ B\\succ A\\). One way to deal\nwith this is to include additional information in the input, for\ninstance specifying which element(s) of the alternative set should be\nmoved while the others keep their previous positions. In our example,\nif only \\(C\\) is going to be moved, then the outcome should satisfy\n\\(C\\succ A\\succ B\\). These and other considerations make it necessary\nto modify the standard model of belief change in order to accommodate\nthe subject matter of preferences.\n",
