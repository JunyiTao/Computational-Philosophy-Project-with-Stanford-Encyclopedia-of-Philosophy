    "main_text": "A History of the Concept\n1. A History of the Concept\n\nThe concept religion did not originally refer to a social\ngenus or cultural type. It was adapted from the Latin term\nreligio, a term roughly equivalent to\n\u201cscrupulousness\u201d. Religio also approximates\n\u201cconscientiousness\u201d, \u201cdevotedness\u201d, or\n\u201cfelt obligation\u201d, since religio was an effect of\ntaboos, promises, curses, or transgressions, even when these were\nunrelated to the gods. In western antiquity, and likely in many or\nmost cultures, there was a recognition that some people worshipped\ndifferent gods with commitments that were incompatible with each other\nand that these people constituted social groups that could be rivals.\nIn that context, one sometimes sees the use of nobis religio\nto mean \u201cour way of worship\u201d. Nevertheless,\nreligio had a range of senses and so Augustine could consider\nbut\u00a0reject it as the right abstract term for \u201chow one\nworships God\u201d because the Latin term (like the Latin terms for\n\u201ccult\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d) was used for the\nobservance of duties in both one\u2019s divine and one\u2019s human\nrelationships (Augustine City of God [1968: Book X, Chapter\n1, 251\u2013253]). In the Middle Ages, as Christians developed\nmonastic orders in which one took vows to live under a specific rule,\nthey called such an order\u00a0religio (and\nreligiones for the plural), though the term continued to be\nused, as it had been in antiquity, in adjective form to describe those\nwho were devout and in noun form to refer to worship (Biller 1985:\n358; Nongbri 2013: ch. 2).\n\nThe most significant shift in the history of the concept is when\npeople began to use religion as a genus of which Christian\nand non-Christian groups were species. One sees a clear example of\nthis use in the writings of Edward Herbert (1583\u20131648).\u00a0As\nthe post-Reformation Christian community fractured into literal\nwarring camps, Herbert sought to remind the different protesting\ngroups of what they nevertheless had in common. Herbert identified\nfive \u201carticles\u201d or \u201celements\u201d that he proposed\nwere found in every religion, which he called the Common Notions,\nnamely: the beliefs that\n\nthere is a supreme\n deity,[2]\nthis deity should be worshipped,\nthe most important part of religious practice is the cultivation\nof virtue,\none should seek repentance for wrong-doing, and\none is rewarded or punished in this life and the next.\n\n\nIgnoring rituals and group membership, this proposal takes an\nidealized Protestant monotheism as the model of religion as such.\nHerbert was aware of peoples who worshipped something other than a\nsingle supreme deity. He noted that ancient Egyptians, for instance,\nworshipped multiple gods and people in other cultures worshipped\ncelestial bodies or forces in nature. Herbert might have argued that,\nlacking a belief in a supreme deity, these practices were not\nreligions at all but belonged instead in some other category such as\nsuperstition, heresy, or magic. But Herbert did include them, arguing\nthat they were religions because the multiple gods were actually\nservants to or even aspects of the one supreme deity, and those who\nworshiped natural forces worshipped the supreme deity \u201cin His\nworks\u201d.\n\nThe concept religion understood as a social genus was\nincreasingly put to use by\u00a0to European Christians as they sought\nto categorize the variety of cultures they encountered as their\nempires moved into the Americas, South Asia, East Asia, Africa, and\nOceania. In this context, fed by reports from missionaries and\ncolonial administrators, the extension of the generic concept was\nexpanded. The most influential example is that of anthropologist\nEdward Burnett Tylor (1832\u20131917) who had a scholarly interest in\npre-Columbian Mexico. Like Herbert, Tylor sought to identify the\ncommon denominator of all religions, what Tylor called a\n\u201cminimal definition\u201d of religion, and he proposed that the\nkey characteristic was \u201cbelief in spiritual beings\u201d (1871\n[1970: 8]). This generic definition included the forms of life\npredicated on belief in a supreme deity that Herbert had classified as\nreligion. But it could also now include\u2014without Herbert\u2019s\nprocrustean assumption that these practices were really directed to\none supreme being\u2014the practices used by Hindus, ancient\nAthenians, and the Navajo to connect to the gods they revere, the\npractices used by Mahayana Buddhists to connect to Bodhisattvas, and\nthe practices used by Malagasy people to connect to the cult of the\ndead. The use of a unifying concept for such diverse practices is\ndeliberate on Tylor\u2019s part as he sought to undermine assumptions\nthat human cultures poorly understood in Christian\nEurope\u2014especially those despised ones, \u201cpainted black on\nthe missionary maps\u201d (1871 [1970: 4])\u2014were not on the very\nsame spectrum as the religion of his readers. This opposition to\ndividing European and non-European cultures into separate categories\nunderlies Tylor\u2019s insistence that all human beings are\nequivalent in terms of their intelligence. He argued that so-called\n\u201cprimitive\u201d peoples generate their religious ideas when\nthey wrestle with the same questions that all people do, such as the\nbiological question of what explains life, and they do so with the\nsame cognitive capacities. They may lack microscopes or telescopes,\nbut Tylor claims that they seek to answer these questions in ways that\nare \u201crational\u201d, \u201cconsistent\u201d, and\n\u201clogical\u201d. Tylor repeatedly calls the Americans, Africans,\nand Asians he studies \u201cthinking men\u201d and\n\u201cphilosophers\u201d. Tylor was conscious that the definition he\nproposed was part of a shift: though it was still common to describe\nsome people as so primitive that they had no religion, Tylor complains\nthat those who speak this way are guilty of \u201cthe use of wide\nwords in narrow senses\u201d because they are only willing to\ndescribe as religion practices that resemble their own expectations\n(1871 [1970: 3\u20134]).\n\nIn the twentieth century, one sees a third and last growth spurt in\nthe extension of the concept. Here the concept religion is\nenlarged to include not only practices that connect people to one or\nmore spirits, but also practices that connect people to\n\u201cpowers\u201d or \u201cforces\u201d that lack minds, wills,\nand personalities. One sees this shift in the work of William James,\nfor example, when he writes,\n\n\nWere one asked to characterize the life of religion in the broadest\nand most general terms possible, one might say that it consists of the\nbelief that there is an unseen order, and our supreme good lies in\nharmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto. (1902 [1985: 51]; cf.\nProudfoot 2000)\n\n\nBy an \u201cunseen order\u201d, James presumably means a structure\nthat is non-empirical, though he is not clear about why the term would\nnot also include political, economic, or other invisible but\nhuman-created orders. The same problem plagues James\u2019s\ndescription of \u201ca MORE\u201d operating in the universe that is\nsimilar to but outside oneself (1902 [1985: 400], capitalization in\nthe original). The anthropologist Clifford Geertz addresses this\nissue, also defining religion in terms of an\n\u201corder\u201d but specifying that he means practices tied to\nconceptions of \u201ca general order of existence\u201d,\nthat is, as he also says, something whose existence is\n\u201cfundamental\u201d, \u201call-pervading\u201d, or\n\u201cunconditioned\u201d (1973: 98, emphasis added). The practices\nthat are distinctly religious for Geertz are those tied to a\nculture\u2019s metaphysics or worldview, their conception of\n\u201cthe overall shape of reality\u201d (1973: 104). Like James,\nthen, Geertz would include as religions not only the forms of life\nbased on the theistic and polytheistic (or, more broadly, animist or\nspiritualist) beliefs that Herbert and Tylor recognized, but also\nthose based on belief in the involuntary, spontaneous, or\n\u201cnatural\u201d operations of the law of karma, the Dao in\nDaoism, the Principle in Neo-Confucianism, and the Logos in Stoicism.\nThis expansion also includes Theravada Buddhism because dependent\nco-origination (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da) is a conception\nof the general order of existence and it includes Zen Buddhism because\nBuddha-nature is said to pervade everything. This third expansion is\nwhy non-theistic forms of Buddhism, excluded by the Herbert\u2019s\nand Tylor\u2019s definitions but today widely considered religions,\ncan serve as \u201ca litmus test\u201d for definitions of the\nconcept (Turner 2011: xxiii; cf. Southwold 1978). In sum, then, one\ncan think of the growth of the social genus version of the concept\nreligion as analogous to three concentric circles\u2014from\na theistic to a polytheistic and then to a cosmic (or\n\u201ccosmographic\u201d [Dubuisson 1998]) criterion. Given the\nnear-automatic way that Buddhism is taken as a religion today, the\ncosmic version now seems to be the dominant one.\n\nSome scholars resist this third expansion of the concept and retain a\nTylorean definition, and it is true that there is a marked difference\nbetween practices that do and practices that do not involve\ninteracting with person-like beings. In the former, anthropomorphic\ncases, practitioners can ask for help, make offerings, and pray with\nan understanding that they are heard. In the latter,\nnon-anthropomorphic cases, practitioners instead typically engage in\nactions that put themselves \u201cin accord with\u201d the order of\nthings. The anthropologist Robert Marett marks this difference between\nthe last two extensions of the concept religion by\ndistinguishing between \u201canimism\u201d and\n\u201canimatism\u201d (1909), the philosopher John Hick by\ndistinguishing between religious \u201cpersonae\u201d and religious\n\u201cimpersonae\u201d (1989: ch. 14\u201315). This difference\nraises a philosophical question: on what grounds can one place the\npractices based on these two kinds of realities in the same category?\nThe many loa spirits, the creator Allah, and the\nall-pervading Dao are not available to the methods of the natural\nsciences, and so they are often called \u201csupernatural\u201d. If\nthat term works, then religions in all three concentric circles can be\nunderstood as sets of practices predicated on belief in the\nsupernatural. However, \u201csupernatural\u201d suggests a two-level\nview of reality that separates the empirically available natural world\nfrom some other realm metaphorically \u201cabove\u201d or\n\u201cbehind\u201d it. Many cultures lack or reject a distinction\nbetween natural and supernatural (Saler 1977, 2021). They believe that\ndisembodied persons or powers are not in some otherworldly realm but\nrather on the top of a certain mountain, in the depths of the forest,\nor \u201ceverywhere\u201d. To avoid the assumption of a two-level\nview of reality, then, some scholars have replaced supernatural with\nother terms, such as \u201csuperhuman\u201d. Hick uses the term\n\u201ctranscendent\u201d:\n\n\nthe putative reality which transcends everything other than itself but\nis not transcended by anything other than itself. (1993: 164)\n\n\nIn order to include loa, Allah, and the Dao but to exclude\nnations and economies, Kevin Schilbrack (2013) proposes the neologism\n\u201csuperempirical\u201d to refer to non-empirical things that are\nalso not the product of any empirical thing. Wouter Hanegraaff (1995),\nfollowing J. G. Platvoet (1982: 30) uses \u201cmeta-empirical\u201d.\nWhether a common element can be identified that will coherently ground\na substantive definition of \u201creligion\u201d is not a settled\nquestion.\n\nDespite this murkiness, all three of these versions are\n\u201csubstantive\u201d definitions of religion because\nthey determine membership in the category in terms of the presence of\na belief in a distinctive kind of reality. In the twentieth century,\nhowever, one sees the emergence of an importantly different approach:\na definition that drops the substantive element and instead defines\nthe concept religion in terms of a distinctive role that a\nform of life can play in one\u2019s life\u2014that is, a\n\u201cfunctional\u201d definition. One sees a functional approach in\nEmile Durkheim (1912), who defines religion as whatever\nsystem of practices unite a number of people into a single moral\ncommunity (whether or not those practices involve belief in any\nunusual realities). Durkheim\u2019s definition turns on the social\nfunction of creating solidarity. One also sees a functional approach\nin Paul Tillich (1957), who defines religion as whatever\ndominant concern serves to organize a person\u2019s values (whether\nor not that concern involve belief in any unusual realities).\nTillich\u2019s definition turns on the axiological function of\nproviding orientation for a person\u2019s life.\n\nSubstantive and functional approaches can produce non-overlapping\nextensions for the concept. Famously, a functional approach can hold\nthat even atheistic forms of capitalism, nationalism, and Marxism\nfunction as religions. The literature on these secular institutions as\nfunctionally religions is massive. As Trevor Ling says,\n\n\nthe bulk of literature supporting the view that Marxism is a religion\nis so great that it cannot easily be set aside. (1980: 152)\n\n\nOn capitalism as a religion, see, e.g., McCarraher (2019); on\nnationalism, see, e.g., Omer and Springs (2013: ch. 2). One\nfunctionalist might count white supremacy as a religion (Weed 2019;\nFinley et al. 2020) and another might count anti-racism as a religion\n(McWhorter 2021). Here, celebrities can reach a religious status and\nfandom can be one\u2019s religious identity (e.g., Lofton 2011;\nLovric 2020). Without a supernatural, transcendent, or superempirical\nelement, these phenomena would not count as religious for Herbert,\nTylor, James, or Geertz. Conversely, interactions with supernatural\nbeings may be categorized on a functional approach as something other\nthan religion. For example, the Thai villager who wears an apotropaic\namulet and avoids the forest because of a belief that malevolent\nspirits live there, or the ancient Roman citizen who takes a bird to\nbe sacrificed in a temple before she goes on a journey are for\nDurkheim examples of magic rather than religion, and for Tillich\nquotidian rather than ultimate concerns.\n\nIt is sometimes assumed that to define religion as a social\ngenus is to treat it as something universal, as something that appears\nin every human culture. It is true that some scholars have treated\nreligion as pan-human. For example, when a scholar defines\nreligion functionally as the beliefs and practices that\ngenerate social cohesion or as the ones that provide orientation in\nlife, then religion names an inevitable feature of the human\ncondition. The universality of religion that one then finds is not a\ndiscovery but a product of one\u2019s definition. However, a social\ngenus can be both present in more than one culture without being\npresent in all of them, and so one can define religion,\neither substantively or functionally, in ways that are not universal.\nAs common as beliefs in disembodied spirits or cosmological orders\nhave been in human history, for instance, there were people in the\npast and there are people in the present who have no views of an\nafterlife, supernatural beings, or explicit metaphysics.\n",
