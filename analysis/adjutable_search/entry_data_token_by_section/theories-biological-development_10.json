    "main_text": "Regulative Theories of Development || Positional information\n8.3 Positional information\n\nMore influential for mainstream developmental biology was the concept\nof positional information. Though originally a contribution to\nregulative theories of development, the concept soon transformed to\nsupport theories of genetic control. This epitomizes the shift in\nbiological thought that followed breakthroughs on DNA structure,\nprotein coding, and other phenomena of molecular genetics (see the entry on\n molecular genetics).\n Lewis Wolpert (1969) introduced the concept of positional information\nto solve (like Turing)\n\n\nthe problem of assigning specific states to an ensemble of identical\ncells, whose initial states are relatively similar, such that the\nresulting ensemble of states forms a well-defined spatial pattern.\n(1969: 4)\n\n\nWolpert\u2019s answer was that each cell in a developing system has a\nunique value reflecting its position in that system, encoded by the\nspatial gradient of a diffusible molecule across the system.\nSpecification of a cell\u2019s position in the system is relative to\none or more points in the system: the source(s) of the diffusible\nmolecule or cell property. Cells that share the same set of points\nrelative to which their position is specified make up a field. Wolpert\nused this model to explain a range of experimental results and\nobservations of development in various species (as well as the toy\n\u201cFrench flag\u201d example). In 1969, Wolpert saw the next task\nas discovering and articulating rules (and underlying mechanisms) for\nspecification of positional information and polarity, the nature of\npoints and boundaries, and \u201cnew meaning to classical concepts\nsuch as induction, dominance and field\u201d (1969: 1).\n\nWolpert\u2019s theoretical approach differed from predecessors in its\nrelation to genetic information. Positional information was proposed\nas a \u201cuniversal mechanism\u201d for \u201ctranslation of\ngenetic information into spatial patterns of differentiation\u201d\n(Wolpert 1969: 1). The concept was designed to integrate gene-based\nand organicist approaches to development. Cells\n\u201cinterpret\u201d changes in their positional information, so as\nto change the pattern of gene activation in a cell. Changing patterns\nof gene expression drive cell differentiation in a developing\norganism. This in turn effects spatial distribution of cell forces\n(e.g., contraction, motility, cell-cell contact), which drives\norganism-level morphogenesis. However, by 1975, Wolpert\u2019s\nthinking about development had undergone a conceptual shift (Keller\n2002). Between 1971 and 1975, Wolpert\u2019s ideas were\n\u201cgeneticized\u201d, after which he accepted the idea of a\ngenetic program for development and the embryo as\n\u201ccomputable\u201d from an egg. In this way, the idea of a\nmorphogen gradient establishing positional information for cells was\nput under genetic control (see\n Section 9).\n\nWolpert and Lewis (1975) proposed a research program of computational\nembryology aimed at a\n\n\ntheory of development [that] would effectively enable one to compute\nthe adult organism from the genetic information in the egg. The\nproblem may be approached by viewing the egg as containing a program\nfor development. (1975: 14)\n\n\nPhilosopher Alexander Rosenberg (1997) endorses this version of\nWolpert\u2019s theory as vindication of strong molecular reductionism\nin developmental biology. Manfred Laubichler and G\u00fcnter Wagner\n(2001), alongside other biological theorists, reject this version of\nreductionism (see\n Section 10).\n Jaeger, Irons, and Monk (2008) propose to reverse Wolpert\u2019s\nconceptual shift with their \u201crelativistic theory of positional\ninformation\u201d, adding a role for regulative feedback by\nresponding cells. Vecchi and Hern\u00e1ndez (2014) criticize\nWolpert\u2019s and Rosenberg\u2019s reductionist computational\nembryology as classically preformationist and note explanatory lacunae\nof the idea of a genetic program pre-established in the egg. This\nfollows Keller (2002), who argues that the twentieth-century consensus\non development is essentially preformationist. This brings us to\n\n\nthe widespread reductionist and deterministic view of development as\nprogrammed in genes\u2026with the implicit idea that the final form\nof the organism is \u201calready there\u201d in the instructions\ncontained in its genome as early as the egg stage.
