    "main_text": "Deflationism\n5. Deflationism\n\nWe began in section 1 with the neo-classical theories, which explained\nthe nature of truth within wider metaphysical systems. We then\nconsidered some alternatives in sections 2 and 3, some of which had\nmore modest ontological implications. But we still saw in section 4\nthat substantial theories of truth tend to imply metaphysical theses,\nor even embody metaphysical positions.\n\nOne long-standing trend in the discussion of truth is to insist that\ntruth really does not carry metaphysical significance at all. It does\nnot, as it has no significance on its own. A number of different ideas\nhave been advanced along these lines, under the general heading of\ndeflationism.\n",
