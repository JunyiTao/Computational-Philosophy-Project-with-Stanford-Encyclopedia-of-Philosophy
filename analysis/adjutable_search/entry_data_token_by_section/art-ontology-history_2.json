    "main_text": "Do works of art exist? || Modes of being and existence\n1.2 Modes of being and existence\n\n\nSome philosophers postulate a plurality of modes of being, and some of\nthese philosophers have attributed modes of being other than existence\nto works of art. An example is C. E. M. Joad, who included a fairly\nlengthy discussion of issues related to the ontology of art in his\npopular Guide to Philosophy of 1936.\n\n\nJoad denied that a work such as Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet\ncould be correctly identified with any existing concrete particular,\nsuch as a script, or with a collection of events, such as those\ninvolved in a staging of the play. Nor should the title\n\u2018Hamlet\u2019 be taken as referring to ideas in the\nauthor\u2019s mind, to some spectator\u2019s experience of the work,\nor to some collection of experiences occasioned by performances of the\nplay. Joad\u2019s alternative was to say that the work of art is\na subsistent object, neither mental nor material, which, like\nother universals, is a constituent of the universe possessing a\nspecial kind of being, subsistence, in its own right. According to\nJoad, then, at least some works are subsistent universals, and this is\nthe sort of entity to which the titles of such works of art refer.\n\n\nIn his Mellon lectures presented at the National Gallery in Washington\nin 1955 (published in 1957), \u00c9tienne Gilson classified works of\nart as Aristotelian substances (for background, see the entries on\nsubstance and Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics).  Gilson also claimed that a\nwork has aesthetic and artistic modes of existence in addition to a\nsubstantial one. A work exists artistically qua product of\nthe artist\u2019s activity, whereas it exists aesthetically when it is the\nobject of someone\u2019s aesthetic (or contemplative) experience. A similar\nplurality of modes of existence of works of art had been postulated by\n\u00c9tienne Souriau (1943, 1947), who posited thing-like\n[chosale], aesthetic, and transcendent modes of\nexistence.\n",
