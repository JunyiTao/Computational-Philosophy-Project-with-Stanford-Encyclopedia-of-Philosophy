To better\nunderstand what the \u201claws of revelation\u201d refer to,\nconsider again the contrast class, viz. the \u201claws of\nreason\u201d (which are of course also found in the revealed\nBible). As mentioned above, this distinction between 2 classes of\nBiblical laws is already alluded to in rabbinic literature\n(cf. Babylonian Talmud, Yoma 67b); Saadya, though, is\nseen as the first Jewish writer to really engage this discussion\nphilosophically. Saadya addresses this distinction in the third\nchapter of his Am\u00e2n\u00e2t (a chapter devoted to an\ninvestigation of \u201ccommandment and prohibition\u201d). The\n\u201claws of reason\u201d (again, the ones described as\n\u201c\u00a0\u2018aqliyy\u00e2t\u00a0\u201d from the root\n\u201cintellect\u201d) are essentially characterized there as\ncommandments and prohibitions in the Bible whose reasons could be\narrived at independently by any rational human being. In other words,\nthese are laws which ought to \u2018make sense\u2019 to any\nreasonable person, and, as such, are basic (one might say, natural)\nmoral laws which, left to our own devices, we ought come up with on\nour own. Examples of such laws are the prohibitions against murder,\nadultery, theft, and lying. The \u201claws of reason\u201d are\ndescribed by Saadya as legislating over matters that, as Saadya says,\nGod \u201chas implanted approval [or, in cases of prohibition,\ndisapproval] of\u2026in our reason\u201d (Altmann, 97). The\n\u201claws of revelation\u201d (sam\u2018iyy\u00e2t, again,\nfrom the root sami\u2018a, \u2018to hear\u2019) are\ndescribed on the contrary as follows:\n\n The Second Class of law consists of matters regarding which reason\npasses no judgment in the way either of approval or disapproval so far\nas their essence is concerned\u2026 (Altmann, 97) \n\n In the pages immediately following, Saadya gives as examples of such\nlaws: the laws demarcating Sabbath and other festival days as separate\nfrom \u2018ordinary\u2019 days, rules about who gets chosen as a\nprophet and/or leader, the Jewish dietary laws, certain sexual\nprohibitions, and laws of purity and impurity.\n",
