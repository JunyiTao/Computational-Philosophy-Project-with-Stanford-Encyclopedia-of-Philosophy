Bodily sensations are typically attributed to bodily\nlocations and appear to have features such as volume, intensity,\nduration, and so on, that are ordinarily attributed to physical\nobjects or quantities. Yet these sensations are often thought to be\nlogically private, subjective, self-intimating, and the source of\nincorrigible knowledge for those who have them. Hence there appear to\nbe reasons both for thinking that pains (along with other similar\nbodily sensations) are physical objects or conditions that we perceive\nin body parts, and for thinking that they are not. This apparent\nparadox is one of the main reasons why philosophers are especially\ninterested in pain. One increasingly popular but still controversial\nway to deal with this apparent paradox is to defend a perceptual or\nrepresentational view of pain, according to which feeling pain is in\nprinciple no different from undergoing other standard perceptual\nprocesses like seeing, hearing, touching, etc. But there are many who\nthink that pains are not amenable to such a treatment. Although it was\nthe treatment of pain as a sensory-discriminative experience that had\ndominated the philosophical discussions throughout most of the\ntwentieth century, attention to pains\u2019 affective-motivational\ndimension has gained prominence in recent years. \n", "toc": [{"#conception": "1.

The common-sense conception of pain\n\nThere are two main threads in the common-sense conception of pain that\npull in opposite directions. We might call this tension the\nact-object duality (or ambiguity) embedded in our\nordinary concept of pain.\n1.1 First thread: pain as something in a body part\n\nThe first thread treats pains as particulars spatially located in body\nregions, or more generally, as particular conditions of body parts\nthat have spatiotemporal characteristics as well as features such as\nintensity (among others). This thread manifests itself in common ways\nof attributing pains to bodily locations, such as the following:\n\n\n(1) I have a sharp pain in the back of my right hand.\n(2) There is a throbbing pain in my left thigh.\n(3) My right shoulder hurts.\n(4) My wisdom tooth aches.\n\n\n\nAccording to this thread, pains are like physical objects or specific\nconditions of physical objects. We also commonly use the verbs\n\u2018feel\u2019 or \u2018experience\u2019 to describe our\nepistemic relation to pains attributed to body parts:\n\n\n(5) I feel a sharp pain in the back of my right hand.\n(6) I am experiencing pain in my upper left thigh, etc.\n\n\n\n(5) suggests that we stand in some sort of perceptual relation to a\nspatiotemporal particular. Without an indefinite article, (6) suggests\nthat I perceive some quantifiable feature or condition of my thigh.\nWhen we feel pains in bodily locations, our attention and nursing\nbehavior are directed toward those locations.\n\nLess frequently, we also talk about the same pain returning or lasting\nintermittently:\n\n\n(7) I have been having the same pain in my knee whenever\nI start jogging.\n(8) My headache returned the moment we started having the\nsame argument again.\n\n\n\nSo according to this thread when we feel pain in parts of our bodies,\nwe perceive something or some condition in those parts.\u00a0 When we\nreport them by uttering sentences like (1) through (8), we seem to\nmake perceptual reports. These reports seem on a par with\nmore straightforward perceptual reports such as:\n\n\n(9) I see a dark discoloration on the back of my right hand.\n(10) I see the red apple on the table.\n(11) I heard a big explosion.\n(12) I am smelling the sweet odor coming from the rose\ngarden.\n(13) I feel the smooth texture of the surface, etc.\n\n\n\nCompare, for instance, (5) and (9): they seem to have the same surface\ngrammar demanding a similar perceptual reading according to which I\nstand in some sort of perceptual relation to something.\n\nThus, this thread in our ordinary conception favors an understanding\nof pains as if they were the objects of our perceptions. When\nthis is combined with our standard practice of treating pains as\nhaving spatiotemporal properties along with other similar features\ntypically attributed to physical objects or quantities, it points to\nan understanding of pains according to which pains might plausibly be\nidentified with physical features or conditions of our body parts,\nprobably with some sort of (actual or impending) physical damage or\ntrauma to the tissue. Indeed, when we look at the ways in which we\ntalk about a pain, we seem to be attributing something bad to a bodily\nlocation by reporting its somatosensory perception there, just as we\nreport the existence of a rotten apple on the table by reporting its\nvisual perception.\n\nNevertheless, the very same common sense, although it points in that\ndirection, resists identifying a pain with any physical\nfeature or condition instantiated in the body. Thus it also seems\nto resist identifying feeling pain in body regions with\nperceiving something physical in those regions.\n\nA quick thought experiment should confirm this. Suppose that we do in\nfact attribute a physical condition, call it PC,\nwhen we attribute pain to body parts, and that PC is the\nperceptual object of such experiences. So, for instance, John\u2019s\ncurrent excruciating experience (call this E) is caused by\nand represents a physical condition in his right thigh and our\nordinary concept of pain applies in the first instance to this\ncondition in his thigh. From this it would follow that\n\n\n(a) John would not have any pain if he had E, but no\nPC in his thigh\n\n(as in the case of, for instance, phantom limb pains and centrally\ngenerated chronic pains such as sciatica),\n\n\nand, conversely,\n\n\n(b) John would have pain if he had PC but no E\n\n(as would be the case, for instance, if he had taken absolutely\neffective painkillers or his thigh had been anesthetized).\n\n\nBut these statements are intuitively incorrect. They appear to clash\nwith our ordinary or dominant concept of pain, which seems to track\nthe feeling of pain (experience) rather than the physical condition.\nThis resistance to identifying pains with localizable physical\nconditions comes from the second thread found in the very same\ncommon-sense conception of pain.\n1.2 Second thread: pain as subjective experience\n\nThat pain is a subjective experience seems to be a truism. Given our\ncommon-sense understanding of pain, this seems to be the more dominant\nthread: instead of treating pains as objects of perceptual experience,\nit treats them as experiences themselves. Indeed it is this thread\nthat the official scientific definition of \u2018pain\u2019 picks up\nand emphasizes, which was first formulated in\u00a0 1979 by a\ncommittee organized by the International Association for the Study of\nPain (IASP), and has been, since then, widely accepted by the\nscientific community and\n clinicians:[1]\n\n\nPain: An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience\nassociated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in\nterms of such damage.\n\nNote: ... Pain is always subjective. Each individual learns\nthe application of the word through experiences related to injury in\nearly life. Biologists recognize that those stimuli which cause pain\nare liable to damage tissue. Accordingly, pain is that experience we\nassociate with actual or potential tissue damage. It is unquestionably\na sensation in a part or parts of the body, but it is also always\nunpleasant and therefore also an emotional experience. Experiences\nwhich resemble pain but are not unpleasant, e.g., pricking, should not\nbe called pain. Unpleasant abnormal experiences (dysesthesias) may\nalso be pain but are not necessarily so because, subjectively, they\nmay not have the usual sensory qualities of pain. Many people report\npain in the absence of tissue damage or any likely pathophysiological\ncause; usually this happens for psychological reasons. There is\nusually no way to distinguish their experience from that due to tissue\ndamage if we take the subjective report. If they regard their\nexperience as pain, and if they report it in the same ways as pain\ncaused by tissue damage, it should be accepted as pain. This\ndefinition avoids tying pain to the stimulus. Activity induced in the\nnociceptor and nociceptive pathways by a noxious stimulus is not pain,\nwhich is always a psychological state, even though we may well\nappreciate that pain most often has a proximate physical cause. (IASP\n2011 Web Edition, cf. IASP-Task-Force-On-Taxonomy 1994)\n\n\nLike other experiences as conscious episodes, pains are thought to be\nprivate, subjective, self-intimating, and the source of incorrigible\nknowledge. These elements can certainly be found in the IASP\ncharacterization, which also adds that pain experiences are\nunpleasant. Indeed, by emphasizing that pain is always a\n\u201cpsychological state\u201d the note warns against a conception\nof pain suggested by the first thread above.\n\nInterestingly, however, when we talk about pains as experiences, we\nalso, in the same breath, talk about feeling them as if these\nexperiences were also the object of some sort of inner perception,\nwhich suggests introspection. Indeed the discussion of privacy,\nsubjectivity, self-intimation, and incorrigibility naturally forces us\nto talk this way.\u00a0 These are paradigm features that many have\nthought mark the mental phenomena as such.\n\n\n\nPains are said to be private to their owners in the strong\nsense that no one else can epistemically access one\u2019s pain in\nthe way one has access to one\u2019s own pain, namely by feeling it\nand coming to know one is feeling it on that basis. This sharply\ncontrasts with the public nature of objects of standard perception,\nthat is, perception of one\u2019s immediate extramental environment\nincluding one\u2019s body. Let\u2019s call this\nexteroception, to contrast with introspection which\nis access to one\u2019s intra-mental activity. So, for instance, the\nvery same apple I see on the table can be seen by others in possibly\nthe exact same way I see it, so is not private in this sense.\n\nPains also seem to be subjective in the sense that their\nexistence depends on feeling them. There is an air of paradox when\nsomeone talks about unfelt pains. One is naturally tempted to say that\nif a pain is not being felt by its owner then it does not exist. Again\ncompare the subjectivity of pains to the \u2018objectivity\u2019 of\nthe objects of standard exteroception. The apple I see does not depend\non my perceiving it in order to exist: (pace Berkeley and\nphenomenalists) its existence is independent of my, or for that matter\nanyone else\u2019s, seeing it.\n\nNot only do people seem to have a special epistemic access to their\nown pains, they also seem to have a very special epistemic\nauthority with respect to their pain: they seem to be\nincorrigible, or even infallible, about their pains and pain\nreports. Necessarily, if I sincerely believe that I am in pain, then I\nam in pain. Conversely, if I feel pain, then I know that I am in pain.\nThis is the self-intimating aspect of pain experiences.\n\nIn short, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any room for a possible gap\nbetween the appearance of pain and being in pain (that is, no\nappearance/reality distinction is applicable to pain). As Kripke\nfamously put it:\n\n\nTo be in the same epistemic situation that would obtain if one had a\npain is to have a pain; to be in the same epistemic situation\nthat would obtain in the absence of pain is not to have a\npain\u2026. Pain \u2026 is not picked out by one of its accidental\nproperties; rather it is picked out by its immediate phenomenological\nquality\u2026. If any phenomenon is picked out in exactly the same\nway that we pick out pain, then that phenomenon is pain.\n(Kripke 1980, pp. 152\u201353)\n\n\nIf there is no appearance/reality distinction applicable to pain, then\nit seems that one cannot be mistaken about one\u2019s beliefs about\none\u2019s pain formed on the basis of feeling pain in the way one\ncan be mistaken about the existence and properties of the apple one\nsees. In the latter case, appearances can be misleading precisely\nbecause the perceptual appearance of an apple might not correspond to\nwhat the apple is like in reality. In apparent contrast to pain,\nnormal exteroception always involves the possibility of misperception,\nand thus miscategorization (that is, misapplication of concepts to the\nobjects of exteroception).\u00a0 Even with a healthy dose of\nskepticism about whether pain experiences (or, sensations in general)\nalways exhibit these features, it is clear that the strong and robust\n(almost definitional) association of these features with pain\nexperiences suffice to make pains puzzling and problematic \u2014 as\nwe will see shortly.\n\n\n1.3 The tension between the two threads\n\nNow that the two threads in our ordinary conception of pain are in\nfull view, we can better appreciate why they are in tension.\nExperiences are in the head, if they are anywhere. Indeed, for most\nphysicalists, they are in the head by being realized in the brain or\nin the central nervous system. So we can\u2019t be locating pains\nqua experiences (or qua sensations, for that matter)\nin body parts when we correctly utter sentences such as (1) through\n(6) \u2014 discounting headaches perhaps. But then what are we\nlocating when we seem to attribute pains to body parts? Recall that,\nalthough the first thread in our common-sense conception treats pains\nas spatiotemporally locatable particulars or particular conditions of\nbody parts, it does not identify pains with them \u2014 it only\nexerts pressure towards such an identification in the light of the\nfact that there doesn\u2019t seem to be any other credible\nalternative (but see below). We have already conducted a little\nthought-experiment to bring this out in Section 1.1. Comparing the\nfollowing two sentences will help us understand the tension\nbetter:\n\n\n(5) I feel a sharp pain in the back of my right hand.\n\n(9) I see a dark discoloration on the back of my right hand.\n\n\nIt is reasonably clear that for (9) to be true, I have to stand in the\nseeing (perceiving) relation to a dark discoloration on the back of my\nright hand, i.e., to a certain surface region on the back of my hand\nmarked by a darker shade of the usual color of my skin, a certain\nregion that can be seen by others possibly in the same way in which I\nsee it. Note that if I am hallucinating a dark discoloration on the\nback of my hand, then (9) is simply false. Also note that although the\ntruth of (9) doesn\u2019t require the possession of any concept by me\nexpressed by the words making up the sentence, my uttering of (9) to\nmake a report typically does \u2014 if we take such\nutterances as expressions of one\u2019s thoughts and take thoughts to\nbe composed of concepts. So my seeing would typically induce me to\nconceptually identify something on the back of my hand as a\ndark discoloration. This is a typical case of categorization of\nsomething extramental under a concept induced by an exteroceptive\nexperience. Of course, my uttering of (9) does more than attribute a\nphysical property to a bodily region: it also reports that I am seeing\nit.\n\nWhat has to be the case for (5) to be true? Whatever the complete\nanalysis of sentences like (5) turns out to be, one thing seems\nreasonably clear: the truth-conditions of (5) put no constraints\nwhatsoever on how things physically are with my hand. Anyone\nwho has a sufficient mastery of our ordinary concept of pain has no\ndifficulty in understanding how (5) could still be true even though\nthere is nothing physically wrong with my hand, which is typically the\ncase in centrally caused chronic pain\n syndromes.[2]\n\nSo we standardly use sentences like (5) to make correct statements\nabout a pain felt in a bodily location even when there may be nothing\nwrong with that location. In other words, when we make claims about\nwhere it hurts (attribute pain to bodily locations), strictly speaking\nwe in fact refrain from logically committing ourselves to there being\nanything physically wrong in those locations \u2014 even though we\nnormally expect to find some physical disorder in them. Compare this\nto my uttering (9) on the basis of my having a very vivid visual\nhallucination of a discoloration on the back of my hand. In such a\ncase, my utterance would be incorrect, because in uttering (9) I\ncommit myself to finding some physical condition (namely, a dark\ndiscoloration) on the back of my hand. If and when I realize that I\nhave hallucinated, then I correct myself and revert to introspective\nmode by saying things like \u201cI seemed to see a discoloration on\nthe back of my hand\u201d or \u201cit appeared to me that there was\na discoloration,\u201d etc. Nothing of this sort happens when I\nrealize or am told that there is nothing physically wrong with my\nhand: I still correctly continue to report the pain I feel\nthere by uttering the very same sentence, (5), or its equivalents. I\ndon\u2019t need to make any correction in my pain report. This shows\nthat despite the pressure exerted by the first thread, it is the\nsecond thread that seems to capture the dominant common-sense\nconception of pain \u2014 as indeed the IASP definition above\nindicates.\n\nStill the puzzle remains: what is it that I am doing when I appear to\nbe attributing something to the back of my hand by correctly uttering\n(5) \u2014 if, as agreed, I am not attributing a mental experience or\na physical condition there? It is not clear whether there is a\ncommon-sense answer to this question. Just as the scientific\ndefinition doesn\u2019t touch on the issue of our common practice of\ncorrectly locating pains in healthy body parts, the common\nsense would probably draw a blank if the problem were articulated\nexplicitly and the question is pressed really hard.\n\nOr maybe not. Intuitively and somewhat naively, what common sense\nwould drive us to say when pressed hard might be something\nlike the\n following.[3]\n Granted, by uttering (5) I am not attributing any sort of physical\nthing or condition to the back of my hand, nor am I locating a mental\nexperience there \u2014 experiences and sensations are strictly\nspeaking in the head if they are anywhere. But when I attend to my\nhand with my mind\u2019s inner eye, so to speak, I clearly feel\nsomething there. I can introspectively examine different\nqualities of that thing such as its sharpness, volume, intensity,\nunpleasantness, burning quality, etc. I can in real time follow the\nchanges in it: it is now somewhat less intense and unpleasant, now\nmore; it is getting duller now, it was sharper and brighter a moment\nago; it seems to be moving toward my fingers, etc. Clearly, I seem to\nbe confronted or acquainted with spatially located something\nthat I can introspectively examine carefully in real time and report\non its various qualities. It is this thing, the object of my inner\nattention, which is located in the back of my hand, which seems\nessentially private, subjective, and about which I can\u2019t be\nwrong.\n\nIf this is what one might like to say intuitively and naively, one\nshould be prepared to swallow its strange consequences: this\nobject of my inner attention is both located in public space\nand logically private, that is, only I can have epistemic access to it\ndespite its being spatiotemporally located. Also, the existence of\nthis object seems to literally depend on my epistemic access to it: it\nseems to go out of existence when I cease to feel it\n(perceive it). In addition, if it is the object of my\nattention (separate from my attention), how could it be the case that\nI cannot be wrong about it? And importantly, if this object is not\nphysical, what sort of thing could it be? A ghostly mental particular\nthat I can introspectively attend to which is nevertheless\nspatiotemporally located beyond my head?\n\nThe act-object duality embedded in our ordinary concept of pain yields\nstrange results when followed intuitively and naively to its logical\nend. But perhaps this duality is a robust symptom of a deeper truth\nunderlying all perception and introspection. Perhaps pain is simply\nthe most paradigmatic example of a broad range of perceptual\nexperiences where this deep underlying iceberg shows its tip most\nprominently and revealingly \u2014 albeit confusedly. Indeed this is\nexactly the case according to so-called sense-datum theories.\n2. Sense-datum theories\n2.1 Introduction\n\nStandard perception (exteroception) can be analyzed as involving the\nperception (act) of a public object. The perceptual act on the part of\nthe perceiving subject, in turn, is analyzed as involving an\nexperience which typically induces conceptual categorization, i.e.,\napplication of concepts to the object of perception and its qualities\n\u2014 not to the experience. Thus perceptual experiences seem\ntransparent to the perceiver, who may be said to perceive the\nextramental reality directly, without first perceiving or somehow\nbeing aware of the experience itself or its qualities. This view is\nsupported by common sense and is typically called naive or direct\nrealism.\n\nAccording to the indirect realists, this directness is an\nillusion; we are in fact directly aware of experiential\nintermediaries, and we perceive the extramental world only indirectly,\nin virtue of being directly aware of these intermediaries. Most early\nindirect realists (e.g., Moore 1903, 1939; Russell 1912; Price 1950)\nthought of these intermediaries as phenomenal or mental particulars,\ntypically called\n sense-data.\n Consider a hallucination of a red apple. Intuitively, the person\nhaving the hallucination seems to see something. This something is\nnot, of course, an apple. But it is an object, according to\nsense-datum theorists, which is shaped like an apple and is really\nred. It is a sense-datum, a phenomenal (mental) individual which\nreally has the qualities that it visually appears to have. Sense-data,\nhowever, are no ordinary objects: they are private, subjective,\nself-intimating, and the source of incorrigible knowledge. According\nto sense-datum theorists, sense-data are internal to one\u2019s\nconsciousness: they are not before one\u2019s sense-organs. These\ntheories claim that there is a hidden act-object structure in the\nperceptual awareness itself. Every perceptual awareness involves the\nact of being aware of phenomenal objects and their qualities that\nphenomenally determine this perceptual awareness, whether or not this\nawareness is a hallucination or a veridical perception of external\nobjects.\n\nOn sense-datum theories, one perceives external objects and their\nqualities indirectly by directly perceiving (being aware of, or\nacquainted with) sense-data internal to one\u2019s consciousness that\nresemble in various degrees the physical objects that cause them.\nAccording to sense-datum theorists, however, we are rarely, if ever,\naware of this indirection in ordinary (veridical) exteroception. It is\nonly critical philosophical reflection on features of perceptual\nawareness that reveals that the indirection must occur. The importance\nof pain and other (intransitive) bodily sensations lies in the fact\nthat the indirection seems to be easily revealed introspectively as is\nshown by our unwillingness to identify the pain we attribute to body\nparts with anything physical in those parts.\n\nWhatever advantages or disadvantages sense-datum theories might have\nwith respect to genuine perception (exteroception) and misperception\nin general, its attraction seems undeniable when it comes to its\ntreatment of pains and other \u201cintransitive\u201d bodily\nsensations like itches, tickles, tingles,\n etc.[4]\n According to many sense-datum theorists, pains are paradigm examples\nof phenomenal individuals, mental objects with phenomenal qualities\nwhose existence depends on their being sensed or felt, and thus are\nlogically private to their owners who feel them. This position\npresumably explains why we have the act-object duality or ambiguity in\npain talk that we discussed earlier: pains qua localizable objects\ncannot exist without the corresponding acts, i.e., without\nsomeone\u2019s acts of experiencing them (Broad\n 1959).[5]\n In other words, the concept of pain plausibly applies to both the\nobject part of the act-object pair and to the act of\nbeing directly aware of these objects.\n\nThe puzzle of locating pains in body parts can be treated in more than\none way within this framework. The most straightforward way is simply\nto take the phenomena at face value and say that pains as mental\nobjects or sense-data are literally located where they seem to be\nlocated in body parts or even in empty space where one\u2019s limb\nwould have been, say, before the amputation. That pains are mental\nparticulars and depend for their existence on being sensed apparently\ndoes not logically preclude their being capable of having, literally,\na spatial location (see Jackson 1976, 1977 for this\n line).[6]\n\nA second and more popular way of handling the location problem is to\nsay that even though pains cannot literally be located in\nphysical space, they can have location in a\nphenomenal space or field that is somehow isomorphic or\nsystematically related to their counterparts (say, tissue damage) in\nphysical space. In fact, this move would also work for visual\nsense-data that require some spatiotemporal framework. In the case of\nbodily sensations, this phenomenal space is sometimes called\none\u2019s somatic field by analogy to a visual field that maps onto\nphysical space (Price\n 1950).[7]\n2.2 Problems for sense-datum theories\n\nThe most important strength of sense-datum theories is that they are\ntailor-made for the peculiarities of pain experiences as well as other\nintransitive bodily sensations that we have discussed above. Indeed,\nthese theories seem to take the naive, perhaps somewhat confused but\nintuitive understanding of pain embedded in common sense and turn it\ninto a full-fledged philosophical theory supported on a general and\nindependent platform about what perception involves. In other words,\nthese theories seem to vindicate the act-object duality embedded in\ncommon-sense conception of pain.\n\nThere is irony in this. The irony is that sense-datum theories find\ntheir most natural home in intransitive bodily sensations like pain\nthat have been traditionally and historically contrasted with\nstandard exteroceptual experiences rather than co-classified\nwith them (for many, feeling pain is not a perceptual affair at all).\nThis is ironic for two reasons. First, the main proponents of\nsense-datum theories advanced these theories mainly as theories of\nexteroception, that is, perception of external physical reality.\nSecond, when applied to standard exteroception, sense-datum theories\ndon\u2019t seem to support the perceptual direct (naive) realism of\ncommon sense at all. Indeed, according to common sense, when I see a\nred apple on the table, I am directly seeing the apple (at least its\nsurface facing me) and its qualities like its redness. In short,\nalthough sense-datum theories that are explicitly advanced as theories\nof perception (exteroception) in general don\u2019t generate much\nconviction, they seem to be more convincing when applied to\nintransitive bodily sensations like pains that have not been\nusually thought to be perceptual.\n\nDespite the clash with common sense, various philosophers have\nadvanced powerful arguments for sense-datum theories about\nwhat perception in general involves (Moore 1903, 1939; Russell 1912;\nPrice 1950; Broad 1959; Jackson 1977, among others). There are also\npowerful arguments against sense-datum theories. Both sorts\nof arguments tend to be general arguments not directly related to\npain, so we won\u2019t cover them here (but see the entry on\n sense-data).\n Whatever the fate of sense-datum theories might be as general\ntheories of exteroception, their appeal as a model for understanding\npains and other intransitive bodily sensations is very strong. Indeed,\nas noted before, introspection seems to be the right mode of access\ninvolved in pain. So even if one finds the anti-sense-datum arguments\nconvincing and rejects indirect realism of this kind for standard\nexteroception, there may still be room for adopting a sense-datum\ntheory for intransitive bodily sensations and for pain in\nparticular.\n\nNevertheless, it is plausible to argue that this apparent strength of\nsense-datum theories of pain is also one of their main weaknesses, in\nthat their function seems to merely codify the conceptual\npeculiarities of pain into a theory rather than explain them. After we\nare told how the sense-datum theories treat pains and other bodily\nsensations, our understanding of these sensations don\u2019t seem to\nbe deepened or advanced significantly. Whatever puzzles we had at the\nstart with only the common-sense conception of pain at hand, they seem\nto be transformed into puzzles about what the theories themselves say\nor imply.\n\nFor instance, the question about what it is that we seem to attribute\nto or locate in our body parts when we claim to have pains in just\nthose parts is answered, on one version of the theory, by saying that\nwe literally locate mental objects with phenomenal qualities in those\nparts. But pains, even by the standards of sense-datum theories, are\nmind-dependent objects, and many have taken this to imply that pains\nare internal to one\u2019s consciousness or experience, and\nare epistemically transparent to their owners partly because of this\n(Perkins 1983,\n 2006).[8]\n If they were literally in physical space, does this mean that\none\u2019s mind spatially extends or overlaps with one\u2019s body?\nAlternatively, shouldn\u2019t it be possible for others, at least in\nprinciple, to \u201ccome across\u201d these pains, that is, access\nand interact with them physically? It is one thing to say that there\nis no logical inconsistency about pains literally being in physical\nspace, but it is another to make the view plausible. The latter\nrequires giving positive arguments showing why our intuitions to the\ncontrary might mislead us here.\n\nOn the other version of the theory, we are told that even though we\nseem to locate something in public space, appearances are misleading;\nrather, we are locating private mental objects in a private phenomenal\nspace, which is conceived to be a kind of space, not merely a\nrepresentation of real space.\u00a0 So, on this version, pains are\nnot, after all, located in body parts, ordinarily understood. But it\nis not clear how these two spaces are supposed to relate to or\ninteract with each other. Phenomenal space is not physical space, nor\nis it a subregion of that space. Thus the question of how they can\ncausally interact becomes an issue for two reasons. First,\nthere is the standard worry about how a physical event can influence\nor be influenced by a non-physical event in a non-physical space.\nSecond, these two spaces need to be systematically correlated with\neach other, but it is not clear whether a principled mapping function\ncan be defined for the correlation especially in the absence of\ncausation. At any rate, these constitute significant challenges for\nthe defenders of this view.\n\nApart from their strange consequences, sense-datum theories seem to\ncommit their defenders to anti-physicalism. A naturalist who is trying\nto understand pain phenomena within a physicalist framework could\nhardly admit the existence of phenomenal objects (Lycan 1987a, 1987b).\nIf there are sense-data, physicalism seems just false. A physicalist\ncannot admit actual objects, which are, say, literally colored,\nshaped, moving and so on, that one is directly aware of but are not\nidentical to the extramental objects of perception. So understood,\nthere seem to be no sense-data to be found in the physical world.\n3. Perceptual theories\n\nBecause sense-datum theories are most plausible when applied to\nintransitive bodily sensations, many philosophers, who believe that a\nnaturalist account of ordinary perception can be given without\nintroducing sense-data, have attempted to understand pains and other\nbodily sensations as species of ordinary perception (exteroception).\nThe so-called perceptual theories of pain are advanced and defended on\nthe hope that pains and other intransitive bodily sensations, contrary\nto first appearances, are species of information gathering which work\non the same principles that govern other sensory modalities for which\na successful direct realist account can be given.\n3.1 Introduction\n\nThe core commitment of any perceptual view of pain, put as broadly as\npossible, is that normally, in having or feeling pain, one is\nperceiving something extramental. In other words, feeling\npain normally involves perceiving something in the same sense\nin which one perceives a red apple when one sees it in good light. It\ninvolves exteroception. Sometimes, in ordinary parlance, the term\n\u2018perception\u2019 is used in conjunction with\n\u2018pain\u2019 as in \u2018pain perception\u2019 to mean\nawareness of pain, or just feeling/experiencing pain. This is the\nintrospective use of \u2018perception\u2019 and should be\nsharply distinguished from what the perceptual theorists mean when\nthey claim that feeling pain involves perceiving something. They have\nexteroception in mind, and we\u2019ll use the term always in this\nsense.\n\nAccording to perceptual theorists, when one feels, say, a sharp pain\nin the back of one\u2019s hand, one perceives some physical feature\nor condition of one\u2019s hand. The proper modality for this\nperception is somatosensory, similar to the sensory modality of touch\nor proprioception (the sensory modality internal to one\u2019s body\nthat informs one about the position and movement of one\u2019s body\nand body parts). Most perceptual theorists identify this feature with\ntissue damage or some condition of the tissue that would likely result\nin damage if sustained in that condition. More abstractly, it is some\nsort of physical disorder due to some tissue trauma, irritation,\ninflammation, or some such pathological condition, or a condition\nclose to such. It is also possible to identify the object of\nperception in pain with the activation of nociceptors innervating the\ndamaged or irritated tissue. (Nociceptors are peripheral nerve endings\nrelatively specialized to respond to potentially damaging stimuli,\ni.e., to noxious stimuli). Let\u2019s use \u2018tissue damage\u2019\nas a stand-in for whatever physical disorderly condition of bodily\ntissue is said to be perceived in feeling pain according to perceptual\ntheorists. Normally, when we talk about the location of a pain, we are\ntalking about the location of this perceptual object, i.e., the\nlocation where the tissue damage is occurring or about to occur.\n\nPerceptual theories of pain as alternatives to sense-datum theories\nwere first explicitly stated and philosophically developed in the\n1960s. The most influential and prominent defenders were Armstrong\n(1962; 1968) and Pitcher (1970; 1971). There were others, but in terms\nof setting the tone and philosophical agenda for the subsequent\ndiscussion for decades to come, it is fair to say that no one has\nsurpassed their enormous\n influence.[9]\n At the time, the dominant view was that pains and other intransitive\nbodily sensations are not perceptual at all: they were conceived to be\nsensations or experiences (\u00e0 la sense-datum theories) that are\nreliably caused by (actual or impending) injury or damage to body\ntissue or internal organs. They were thus thought to be useful warning\nsignals, but they didn\u2019t have much in common with standard ways\nof perceiving extramental world. This view has still many defenders\ntoday. Although the conception of pains as sense-data has been largely\nabandoned, those who are not sympathetic to perceptual theories still\nhold what might be called the \u201csensation or qualia view of\npain\u201d, according to which pain is not a phenomenal\nobject but a phenomenal quality of one\u2019s\nexperience, or alternatively, it is a subjective experience with\ncertain qualia or qualitative character that one is directly\nacquainted with when one is in pain. (Conee 1984 defends a qualia view\nof pain. But he draws a distinction between the state of being in pain\nand this state\u2019s qualitative content, qualia. He claims that we\nuse \u2018pain\u2019 for both, depending on the context. Aydede 2019\ndevelops a modern version of qualia theories that is adverbialist and\nweak representationalist with completely physicalist credentials and\nclaimed to be free of the problems that plagued the older qualia\ntheories.)\n3.2 The appearance/reality problem\n\nThe main source of resistance to a perceptual view of pain comes from\nthe common-sense conception of pain according to which pains are\nsensations with essential privacy, subjectivity, self-intimation, and\nincorrigibility. These apparently essential features of pains pose\ndifficulties for any perceptual theory. Indeed, they can be used in\nadvancing anti-perceptualist arguments whose general form can be put\nin the following way. Genuine perception always involves the\npossibility of misperceiving the perceptual object that is not\nessentially private and subjective. In other words, there is always an\nappearance/reality distinction applicable to the objects of genuine\nperception which gives rise to the possibility that the perceptual\nappearance of this object misleads us about what the object is like in\nreality. The main reason for this is that these objects have a reality\nbeyond their appearances. They are thus public objects and capable of\nexisting on their own without anyone\u2019s perception of them. But\nfeeling pain has none of these features. Therefore, it cannot be\ngenuine perception.\n\nSo, how do the perceptual theorists handle this objection, which lies\nbehind the intuitive resistance to treating pain as a form of\nperception? Given the core commitment of perceptual views (namely,\nthat feeling pain involves perceiving something extramental), one\nmight think that perceptual theorists identify pain with tissue\ndamage. Indeed, if one takes this view, the above objection seems\nalmost decisive against it. But relatively few defenders actually take\nthis route \u2014 among the most notable are Newton (1989), Stephens\nand Graham (1987), and Hill (2004, 2006). Most others, including\nArmstrong and Pitcher, bowed to common-sense understanding of pain and\nidentified pains with pain experiences or sensations, understood in a\ndirect realist fashion. If pains are identified with experiences, not\nwith their causes (i.e., tissue damage), then the above objection\nseems to disappear (but see below).\n\nIt is primarily for this reason that most perceptual theorists\nidentify feeling pain with having an experience in the first place\n\u2014 just as the pain scientists and clinicians do (see IASP\ndefinition above) following the second thread in our ordinary\nconception of pain. But this is the experience mediating or involved\nin the perception of tissue damage. In other words, they\ngrant that the (dominant) concept of pain is the concept of a\nsubjective experience, but they insist that this experience is\nessentially perceptual: it constitutes our perception of tissue\ndamage. Compare the situation with seeing. In seeing a red apple in\ngood light, I am having a visual experience which is perceptual: it\nconstitutes my seeing the red apple. The difference lies not in the\nflow of information, but in the locus of our spontaneous interest and\nconceptual identification directly induced by the perceptual\nexperience. According to most perceptual theorists, we apply the\nconcept of pain, PAIN, primarily to the perceptual experience we are\nhaving, not to the object of this experience, i.e., tissue damage\n(even though, as discussed above, common sense also uses confusingly\nthe same word \u2018pain\u2019 to indicate where the tissue damage\nmight be occurring by applying it to a bodily location \u2014 more on\nthis\n shortly).[10\n In other words, \u2018pain\u2019 names a subjective experience. In\nvision, however, the locus of conceptual identification is different:\nnormally it is the object of our visual experience we are interested\nin, say, a red apple seen in good light and identified as such. Thus,\nwe both perceptually and conceptually focus on it and its visible\nproperties such as its redness, roundness, etc., by applying our\nconcepts, RED, ROUND, APPLE, to it on the basis of our visual\nexperience. Of course, we are sometimes interested in and can focus\nand report on our visual experiences too, but this happens usually\nwhen we are not sure about what we are seeing.\n\nThere is thus an asymmetry in our spontaneous reaction to incoming\nstimuli in seeing and having pain; that is, our spontaneous interest\nand focus directly resulting from the perceptual experiences is\ndifferent in each case. We can represent this asymmetry with a\nschematic (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: There is asymmetry in concept application\neven when it is assumed that the structure of information flow may be\nsymmetrical in the contrast cases.\n\n\nThus the incorrigibility mentioned before reduces to one\u2019s\nincorrigibility about one\u2019s occurrent experiences. To the extent\nto which we are incorrigible in discriminating and conceptually\nidentifying our own experiences, to that extent we cannot be wrong\nabout our own pains. Hence the locus of concept application is the\npain experiences, even though it might seem to us as if we were\napplying the concept of pain to bodily locations (see below). It\nfollows that hallucinations or illusions are possible, in one sense,\nnot about feeling/experiencing pain, but about whether these\nexperiences\u2019 correctly represent some tissue damage, that is,\nthe object of perception in feeling pain.\n\nThe privacy and subjectivity of pains are explained similarly. If\npains are experiences, they cannot exist without being the state of\nsomeone\u2019s mind. In other words, they exist insofar as one has\nthem: they are mental states or processes, hence essentially\nmind-dependent. The privacy of pains again reduces to the privacy of\nexperiences. There may be philosophical problems about how privacy,\nsubjectivity and incorrigibility are possible in a completely physical\nworld, but if there are such problems, they are general problems about\nhaving perceptual experience of any kind, not necessarily pertaining\nto pains and other intransitive bodily sensations.\n3.3 The problem of pain location\n\nThe perceptualist identification of pains with experiences is not in\nthe clear yet: the perceptual theorist has to give an account of the\ncommon practice of attributing pains to bodily locations. For if pains\nare perceptual experiences they can\u2019t be intelligibly (let alone\ncorrectly) located in body parts (except perhaps in the head).\n\nThe most common perceptualist treatment of this problem concedes that\nthere is no way to analyze sentences attributing pain to body parts,\nlike (1)\u2013(6), which would do complete justice to all aspects of\nour common-sense conception of pain. Nevertheless, the resulting\naccount, it is claimed, comes pretty close. According to the basic\nproposal, when I utter a sentence like\n\n\n(5) I feel a sharp pain in the back of my right hand,\n\n\nI primarily self-attribute a certain kind of experience which has an\nintentional content (Armstrong 1962, 1968, pp. 314\u2013316; and\nPitcher 1970, pp. 383\u2013385, 1971 \u2014 see also Dretske 1999,\n2006; Tye 1997, 2006a). To say that an experience has an intentional\ncontent is to say that it represents a certain situation or state of\naffairs (which may be quite complex), or to say that it has an\nintentional content with a non-indicative function like issuing a\ncommand (imperative content \u2014 see below). So for instance, when\nI see a red apple on the table, I am having a visual experience which\nrepresents, among other things, a red apple on the table. Some\nperceptualists might describe the proper intentional or\nrepresentational content of experiences in less objectual terms by not\nnaming what is represented in terms of ordinary objects like apples\nand tables. For these theorists, it is more appropriate to\ncharacterize the representational content of perceptual experiences in\nterms of the ways in which the sensible qualities of those objects are\ninstantiated or distributed in one\u2019s perceptual field.\nExperiences detect or track these qualities. For instance, they may\nsay that my visual experience represents the instantiation of redness\nwith the instantiation of a certain (apple-like) shape quality, etc.\nBut both ways of characterizing this content are meant to be objective\nin the sense that they represent extramental reality (at least, partly\n\u2014 it all depends on how one conceives of so-called secondary\nqualities). Treating perceptual experiences as having intentional\ncontent is appropriate and in line with the naturalistic motivation\nbehind developing perceptual accounts in general, for this is how they\nserve their primary function of informing their owners about their\nimmediate extramental environment, including bodily environment.\n\nSo the proposal is that, just like other perceptual experiences, pain\nexperiences also represent. They represent tissue damage as occurring\nin a certain region of one\u2019s body. The location of pain, then,\nis the location of tissue damage as represented by pain experiences.\nThe location is an intentional location. So (5) should be analyzed as\nself-attributing an experience which represents a certain kind of\ntissue damage occurring in the back of my hand. In other words, even\nthough the surface structure of sentences (5) suggests that there is\nan attribution of pain to a bodily location (more strictly, that I\nstand in the feeling relation to a pain which is located in a part of\nmy body), the proposed analysis says that this is not what is\ngoing on. What I do when I utter (5) is an attribution of a different\nsort: I attribute to myself a feeling state (an\nexperience) which has an intentional content to the effect that a\ncertain region of my body is in a physical condition of a certain\nsort.\n\nOn this view, there is thus a confusion in common-sense ways of\ntalking, due to the fact that the pain is not in my hand; the pain,\nbeing a state of feeling or experience, is \u201cin my mind.\u201d\nIt is the physical disturbance that is in my hand which my feeling\nstate represents (in a confused and indistinct way, as Descartes would\nput it). Upon reflection, however, we may realize that in uttering (5)\nI actually attribute an intentional feeling state to\nmyself which in turn attributes a physical disturbance to my\nhand. The colloquial ways of speaking just jumble the pain with the\ndisturbance, and thus confuse and mislead us. Pains, on this view, are\nexperiences, not objects of our experiences. Moreover, since these\nexperiences have representational content, they have accuracy\nconditions: they can be correct or incorrect; they can veridically\nrepresent or misrepresent. But even when they misrepresent, these\nexperiences are pain experiences. So I can be in genuine pain, even\nthough there is nothing physically wrong with my hand.\n\nNote that according to this analysis, there are, in a sense, two kinds\nof property attribution going on: an attribution of an experience and\nan attribution of tissue damage to a body part. But in uttering (5)\nI do only the former attribution, not the latter. The latter\nattribution is done not by me but by my experience, so to speak, by\nrepresenting it as happening in my hand. This is why I am not\nlogically committed to finding tissue damage in my hand in\ntruly uttering (5) \u2014 even though this is what I normally\nexpect to find there. Indeed, as observed in the first\nsection, if it turns out that there is nothing physically wrong with\nmy hand, I am not wrong. (5) is still true. But my experience\nis now wrong: it misrepresents the back of my hand as having something\nphysically wrong with it, as if some tissue damage were occurring\nthere. I am having an illusion about my hand but I am still in genuine\npain. Illusory or hallucinatory pain experiences are still genuine\npains.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s and Pitcher\u2019s perceptual accounts of pain\nlocation have been very influential. Treating pain location as the\nintentional location of tissue damage as represented in the pain\nexperience, in one form or another, seems to dominate the thinking in\nthis area. Nevertheless, there is a sizable philosophical literature\non the problem of pain location or the spatiality of pain in\n general.[11\n\n3.4 Direct and indirect perceptual theories\n\nThe perceptual view of pain as presented so far is a view even an\nindirect realist can subscribe to, although, as a matter of historical\nfact, very few indirect realists have done so (Perkins 1983, 2006;\nMaund 2003, 2006). A sense-datum theorist is someone who thinks that\nall perception of extramental reality is indirect, mediated by a\ndirect perception of sense-data that stand in certain systematic\nrelations to extramental objects in the world in virtue of which\nsense-data contingently come to represent them. So it is entirely\npossible, in fact reasonable, to hold that pain sense-data are also\nrepresentational. In other worlds, direct awareness of pain sense-data\ncould constitute the indirect perception of tissue damage in bodily\nregions which typically and systematically cause these sense-data.\n\nThe reason why this line was not pursued by indirect realists has\nprobably something to do with the intuitive resistance against any\nperceptual view of pain already embedded in our ordinary conception\nthat we discussed\n above.[12]\n Indirect realists like sense-datum theorists, as we have already\nseen, have the theoretical resources to accommodate the intuitive\nunderstanding of pain without forcing it into a perceptualist mold.\nWithout any qualms, they can say that we are directly and immediately\naware of pain qua a mental object or quality, whether or not\nthis represents or signals tissue damage. This is to say that they\nalready have a locus of concept application in their theory for the\nconcept of pain: PAIN directly applies to the experience or to its\ninternal direct object, i.e., to either a sense-datum or to\nits direct awareness. This seems to accommodate all the intuitions\nembedded in common sense; why go further? Furthermore, if one is not a\nperceptualist, one doesn\u2019t have an obligation to deal with what\nwe\u2019ll call below the problem of focus, the problem of\nexplaining why there is an asymmetry in conceptual focus between pain\nand standard exteroception if both are genuinely perceptual.\n\nIn practice, however, almost all defenders of perceptual view of pains\nare direct realists. If one wants to run a direct realist version of\nthe perceptual theory, however, one immediately runs into the\ndifficulty of finding an appropriate locus for direct perceptual\nawareness, and for that matter, a locus for immediate concept\napplication; that is, one runs into the difficulty of finding an\nobject, state, or event to which we spontaneously apply PAIN, ITCH,\nTICKLE, etc., when we are introspectively aware of our pains, itches,\ntickles, etc., and report them on this basis. This difficulty arises\nbecause the mark of any (early) direct realism in the theory of\nperception is the repudiation of consciously available perceptual\nintermediaries that mediate standard exteroception: when I see a red\napple on the table, there is no object or quality distinct from the\napple and its redness such that I see the apple in virtue of seeing\nit (or more generally, in virtue of directly perceiving or\nbeing aware of it). On the direct realist view, when I see an\napple, I directly perceive, or am directly acquainted with, the apple\nand its qualities such as its redness. This view works well in\nveridical perception: the locus of concept application is always the\npublic object of perception, like the apple and its properties. It\nalso explains why the spontaneous concept application is the way it is\neven when one hallucinates or has illusions. Even when one\nhallucinates a red apple, one is naturally disposed to apply the\nconcept RED APPLE to what one either takes or is tempted to take to be\nthe public object of one\u2019s epistemic efforts and its publicly\navailable features, and rarely, if ever, to what one believes to be a\nprivate mental object or quality.\n\nBut how is the repudiation of consciously available perceptual\nintermediaries to be reconciled with the admission that the concept of\npain is the concept of a subjective sensation/experience of a certain\nsort? Recall that most perceptual theorists admit that introspective\nreports of pain in body regions are reports of experiences\nthat represent physical disorder of some sort in those regions. This\nis just to say that when one is in pain one is directly aware of a\nsensation or experience, i.e., pain. This in turn means that the\nconcepts we are spontaneously prompted to apply in having pains and\nother intransitive bodily sensations directly apply to the prompting\nsensations/experiences in the first place \u2014 appearances to the\ncontrary. So how to understand the direct realist\u2019s talk of\nconscious sensations or experiences?\n3.5 Adverbialist perceptual theories\n\nDirect realists reject the act-object analysis of perceptual\nexperiences advanced by sense-datum theorists and other indirect\nrealists. According to most early direct realists (e.g., Ducasse 1952,\nSellars 1975), even when visually hallucinating a red apple on the\ntable, one does not directly see a private mental particular or a\nconstellation of mental qualities; rather one is having a visual\nexperience that is like an experience which is normally brought about\nwhen one actually sees a real red apple on the table. Direct realists,\nin other words, typically insist that such cases should not\nbe analyzed in terms of a perceiver standing in a certain perceptual\nrelation to a private mental object or quality. Rather the analysis\ninvolves only one particular, the perceiver herself, and her being in\ncertain sorts of (perceptual, experiential) states or conditions that\nare typically brought about under certain circumstances in which one\ngenuinely perceives something. In standard cases, when one is having a\nveridical perception, the experiential state of the perceiver is\nbrought about by the actual object of her perception, and the\nperceiver\u2019s state is qualitatively differentiated by the causal\ninfluences of the sensible properties of the public object. In\nnonstandard cases like in hallucinations and illusions,\nphenomenologically the same kinds of states are brought about by\ndifferent causal routes, and the qualitative differentiation of\none\u2019s experiential state in such non-veridical cases is the\nresult of deviant causal influences. (Pitcher 1970, p. 384)\n\nThis sort of analysis of experiences is sometimes known as\nadverbialism in the literature because in perceiving a red object one\nis said to be in a state of perceiving something \u201cred-ly.\u201d\nThe theoretical import of this way of talking is that perceiving\nsomething that is red is a manner of perceiving that object\nthat would be distinct from the manner of perceiving it if the object\nwere blue, in which case one would be perceiving it\n\u201cblue-ly.\u201d Similarly when one hallucinates a red object,\nthere is only one object, the perceiver who is sensing in a certain\nmanner, namely, red-ly. In other words, \u2018red\u2019 is said to\nqualify not a private object but rather a state or activity of a\nperson, that state being a manner of perceiving or sensing physical\nobjects that are\n red.[13]\n For our purposes, keeping up with the general naturalistic motivation\nbehind developing direct realist views, we can take adverbialism as an\nattempt to get rid of mysterious mental objects or qualities in favor\nof metaphysically less costly states or activities of persons or\nmanners of perceiving that qualify persons qua subjects of experience.\nSo a pain experience, for a direct realist, is a specific manner in\nwhich tissue damage is (somatosensorially) perceived in a bodily\nregion. When we report pain, we report the occurrence of experiences\nunderstood this way \u2014 adverbially.\n\nAdverbialism of this sort can be effectively combined with\nintentionalism or representationalism about experience (for more on\nthe connection between adverbialism and representationalism, see Kraut\n1982, and Lycan 1987a, 1987b). An adverbialist has to somehow\ncharacterize these ways or manners of sensing/perceiving for\ndistinguishing between them, and a natural way to do that is by\nappealing to the standard or canonical conditions under which those\nperceptual events are brought about (recall how direct realists want\nto handle a visual hallucination: one is having a visual experience\nthat is like an experience which is normally brought about when one\nactually sees a real red apple on the table). Thus it may be\nreasonable to argue that those canonical conditions are what the\nspecific perceptual events or activities of the persons\nrepresent. For instance, it is plausible to claim that a\nspecific perceptual activity constitutes the perception of red (= the\nperceptual event representing the instantiation of red) because it is\nthe kind of psychological event regularly (canonically) caused by red\nsurfaces \u2014 indeed one might expect that the psychophysics of\nsensory modalities would detail these canonical or standard conditions\nin objective terms. Although this maneuver is open to direct realists,\nit is optional. When one takes this option the result is pretty much a\nstrong form of representationalism \u2014 for which see next\nsection.\n\nThere are various technical difficulties with adverbialism, especially\nwhen dealing with phenomenologically complex overall experiences such\nas having three pains of different qualitative character\nsimultaneously occurring in three different locations in one\u2019s\nbody. It is not clear whether adverbialist approaches can successfully\ntie the appropriate manners corresponding to different qualities with\nthe right pains or tissue damage on different locations. (See Jackson\n1975, 1977 for a detailed criticism of this sort; Tye 1996a, pp.\n74\u201377, contains a useful summary.) Furthermore, even when one\nmight successfully get rid of mysterious mental objects like\nsense-data with this adverbialist move, it is not clear whether\nadverbialism might still lead to a form of property dualism according\nto which one is directly aware of certain (non-physical)\nphenomenological qualities instantiated by experiences realized by\nbrain states. These qualities seem to be required to explain how the\nmanners of different perceptual activities of a perceiver can be\ndifferentiated. \n\nThere are other sources of resistance to direct perceptual theories of\npain and other intransitive bodily sensations. Some objections stem\nfrom considerations about whether direct perceptual theories can give\nadequate accounts of perception in general, so are not specific to\ntheir treatment of pain. One of the most frequently discussed worries\nabout direct perceptual theories in general is whether they can do\njustice to the internalist intuition that perceptual experience is\nphenomenally rich and peculiar in a way that cannot be pushed back to\nthe extramental world. In the case of early direct realists like\nArmstrong and Pitcher, this worry is even more pressing since they\nwere cognitivist about perceptual experience in general; that is, they\nattempted to explain perception in terms of belief acquisition (or, in\nterms of acquisition of belief-like cognitive states). But beliefs\ndon\u2019t seem to have the right kind of phenomenology associated\nwith perceptual experiences and bodily sensations (see Everitt 1988\nand Grahek 1991 for this kind of criticism). As pointed out earlier,\nearly direct realists played down the importance of experiential\nphenomenology and sometimes even denied its existence fearing that\nacknowledging it will lead to the introduction of sense-data or\n\u201cirreducibly psychic\u201d\n qualia.[14]\n But this concern about qualia or phenomenology in general drove many\naway from the early direct perceptual theories (especially those who\nwere not much worried about skepticism and epistemology in general)\nwith the conviction that these theories are not adequate after all for\ncapturing the rich and robust phenomenology of perceptual\nexperiences.\n4. Representationalist theories\n\nConfronted with such difficulties and many others, it is tempting to\nadopt a strong form of representationalism that openly admits the\nexistence of phenomenologically rich experiences, while preserving the\nbasic intuition and naturalistic motivation behind direct realism.\nIndeed, many have yielded to this temptation.\n4.1 Introduction\n\nRepresentationalism about pain is the view that the entire\nphenomenology of a pain experience is strictly identical to its\nrepresentational or intentional content. In other words, the\nphenomenal and representational contents of pain are one and the same\nthing, thus they cannot come apart. Among the defenders of pain\nrepresentationalism understood this way are Harman (1990), Dretske\n(1995, 1999, 2003), Tye (1996, 1997, 2006a, 2006b), Byrne (2001),\nSeager (2002), Bain (2003, 2007, 2013, 2017), and Cutter & Tye\n(2011), Cutter\n (2017).[15]\n\nMost early direct realist accounts of perception, as mentioned before,\nwere shy about acknowledging a robust phenomenology for experiences.\nThis was primarily because experiential phenomenology was associated\nwith indirect realism and sense-data theories in particular. Many\nearly direct realists embraced adverbialism because adverbialism\npromised a way of being realist about experiences while\navoiding an act-object view of them. Because most direct realists\nidentified pains with sensory experiences rather than their objects,\nthe direct perceptual theorists about pain needed a robust (realist)\nnotion of experience. Adverbialism gave way to a strong form of\nrepresentationalism by suggesting ways in which intentional content\ncould be naturalized on the basis of those canonical conditions that\ncausally/lawfully control the occurrence of perceptual experiences in\nvirtue of which they represent those bodily conditions. This opened up\nthe possibility of defending direct realism about a robust\nexperiential phenomenology with completely naturalistic credentials.\nThe result was strong representationalism about all experiential\nphenomenology, according to which the entire phenomenal (qualitative)\ncharacter or qualities of any experience is metaphysically constituted\nwithout remainder by its (wide) representational content (=phenomenal\ncontent)\n\nHence, representationalism about experience in this context needs to\nbe understood in a reductionist sense. As we have seen, indirect\nrealist theories, especially in the form of sense-datum theories, were\nalso advanced as representational theories (perhaps excluding the\nintransitive bodily sensations). Indeed, the old name for indirect\nrealism was \u201crepresentative realism.\u201d On these theories,\nin having a perceptual experience we are directly acquainted with\nqualia, understood either as intrinsic qualities of experiences or as\nproperties of phenomenal individuals like sense-data. But, at least in\nstandard exteroception, these qualities contingently\nrepresent objective sensible properties of public objects in virtue of\neither resembling them or by being regularly caused by their\ninstantiations \u2014 or both. In other words, on an indirect realist\napproach, they are distinct existences: qualia or sense-data come\nto represent public objects and their sensible properties in\nvirtue of some contingent relations holding between them\n(resemblance or causation).\n\nHowever, in her acknowledgment of phenomenology, the reductionist\ndirect realist cannot have such phenomenal objects somehow internal to\none\u2019s mind or experience, nor can she endorse the existence of\nqualities intrinsic to experiences that we can become\ndirectly aware of in introspection \u2014 the basic direct\nperceptualist intuition, recall, is that our experiences are\ntransparent to us in that they present us the world directly and\nimmediately (this external relation is primary). So if qualia are to\nbe retained in one\u2019s direct realist picture of perception, these\nqualia need to be reduced to representational content of perceptual\nstates. We will sometimes use \u2018strong representationalism\u2019\nto distinguish this view from \u201crepresentative realism\u201d\n(see Block 2006 \u2014 Block uses \u2018representationism\u2019 to\nmark the same distinction).\n\nLike earlier direct realists, strong representationalists tend to be\nnaturalists or physicalists. Therefore these theories usually come\nwith a naturalist account of how these states (thought of as realized\nin the central nervous system) acquire their representational content.\nThe most common account is either an ideal causal co-variation theory\n(informational semantics \u2014 see Dretske 1981, Fodor 1987, Aydede\nand G\u00fczeldere 2005) or a teleological psychosemantics (see\nMillikan 1984, Papineau 1987) or both (Dretske 1988, 1995; Tye 1996a).\nThese are externalist\n theories.[16]\n\nTo recap, strong representationalism is the modern day\u2019s direct\nrealism about perception, where adverbialism is replaced by\nrepresentationalism run on a naturalistic story about how perceptual\nexperiences acquire their (analog) representational content that in\nturn constitutes their phenomenology. So, according to strong\nrepresentationalism, pain experiences feel the way they do in virtue\nof their representational content, and nothing else. They represent\nvarious disorderly conditions of bodily tissue. The way they represent\nthese conditions is analogous to the way our visual system represents\ncolors. If colors are (at least, partly) objective features of\nsurfaces like their surface spectral reflectances, our visual\nexperiences don\u2019t represent colors as such, so we cannot come to\nconceptualize colors as spectral reflectances on the basis of their\n\u201cgrainless\u201d visual presentations. So it is no objection to\nrepresentationalism that our pain experiences don\u2019t represent\ntissue damage as such, which is to say that we cannot necessarily\nconceptualize what pain experiences represent as tissue damage solely\non the basis of these experiences.\n\nIt is sometimes said that perceptual experiences represent what they\ndo nonconceptually, which is often times equated with\nanalog content (realized in picture-like continuous\nrepresentations). In this context we can take this as a claim about\nthe way experiences are representationally structured: they are not\nstructured out of concepts (discrete representations) as thoughts are\nusually thought to be. Every sensory modality has a range of\nproprietary qualities that they can detect. Pain experiences seem no\ndifferent, although they may be less rich in terms of their\ninformational content compared to vision for instance. Nevertheless,\nit is reasonable to argue that qualitative differences in pain\nexperiences are due to their representing different bodily conditions.\nTye lists a number of candidates:\n\n\u2026 a twinge of pain represents a mild, brief case of damage. A\nthrobbing pain represents a rapidly pulsing disorder. Aches represent\nregions of damage inside the body rather than on the surface. These\nregions are represented as having volume, as gradually beginning and\nending, as increasing in severity, as slowly fading away. The volumes\nso represented are not represented as precise or sharply bounded. This\nis why aches are not felt to have precise locations, unlike pricking\npains, for example. A stabbing pain is one that represents sudden\ndamage over a particular well-defined bodily region. This region is\nrepresented as having volume (rather than being two-dimensional), as\nbeing the shape of something sharp-edged and pointed (like that of a\ndagger). In the case of a pricking pain, the relevant damage is\nrepresented as having a sudden beginning and ending on the surface or\njust below, and as covering a very tiny area. A racking pain is one\nthat represents that the damage involves the stretching of internal\nbody parts (e.g., muscles). (Tye 1997, p. 333; cf. Tye 1996, 2006a)\n\n\nThe problem of pain location is handled in the same way that the early\nperceptual theories handled them: the location of pain is the location\nthat the pain experiences represent as where the tissue damage is\noccurring. This sort of account becomes more attractive in light of\nthe fact that we now have a much more robust and realist notion of\nexperience whose phenomenological-cum-representational-content is a\ndirect guide to the location of tissue damage. The phenomenology of\npain experiences now directly (transparently) presents tissue damage\nto the sufferer in virtue of its identity with its representational\ncontent (Tye 2006a, 2006b).\n4.2 The problem of focus\n\nOne of the central difficulties for any perceptual/representational\nview of pain is to explain why, if feeling pain is genuinely\nperceiving tissue damage in a body part, we report its experience\nrather than the tissue damage (see Pitcher 1970, pp. 379\u201380;\nArmstrong 1962, p. 125; and Aydede 2009, 2017b for the statement of\nthe\n difficulty).[17]\n We may call this difficulty the problem of focus for perceptual\ntheories in general (including strong representationalist views).\nAccording to the common sense conception of pain (and following it,\nmost perceptual theories) we are, epistemologically and\npsychologically, more interested in the experience than its object,\ntissue damage. Our spontaneous conceptual reaction also follows this\npattern: there is a marked difference in the locus of concept\napplication or conceptual identification between standard\nexteroception and pain. As depicted in Figure 1 above, there is an\nobvious asymmetry between the two. If feeling pain is nothing but\nperceiving tissue damage in a bodily region on a par with seeing a red\napple, then one would naturally expect that when we report pain in\nbody parts, we are reporting a perceptual relation that obtains\nbetween the perceiver and an extramental condition perceived.\n\nBut this is not what we find. Instead, what we find is a report of an\nexperience of a certain sort whose informational/representational\netiology makes no difference to its own conceptual classification. A\npain report is a report of an experience whose representational\naccuracy is of no relevance to whether the report itself is accurate.\nRecall that, on most perceptual theories, when I utter a sentence like\n(5), I am saying something like \u201cI am having an experience which\ntells me that there is some sort of physical disorder in the back of\nmy hand.\u201d In other words, I simply report an experience that\ntells me something. Whether or not I come to believe what it tells me\nis a matter of factors that ought not to be read into the analysis of\nwhat the truth-conditions of (5) are. In fact, this sort of analysis\nproposed by perceptual theorists seems initially plausible given the\nordinary conception of pain, and thus can be taken as an argument in\nfavor of such theories. But this is precisely where the problem lies\nfor perceptual theories. Why is a pain report a report of an\nexperience in the first instance if the experience is genuinely\nperceptual (exteroceptual)? Isn\u2019t this strange? Nothing of this\nsort happens in genuine perception. In fact, this asymmetry can be\ntransformed into a compelling argument against perceptual (as well as\nstrong representationalist) theories in the following way.\n\nEvery genuine case of perception invites reporting an instance of\nperception in the relevant modality by sentences similar to (9)-(13),\nwhere the perceptual verb is used dominantly as a success verb. For\ninstance:\n\n\n(10) I see a red apple on the table.\n\n\nThis is for good reason: perception essentially is an activity whereby\none gathers information about one\u2019s (extramental) environment in\nreal time (including one\u2019s internal bodily environment of\ncourse). So it is not surprising that the dominant form of reporting\nis in the form of a relation between the perceiver and the perceived\nwhere the latter are extramental objects or conditions of one\u2019s\nenvironment. It is also not surprising that perception typically\nyields conceptual categorization of the perceived object or condition\nin the first instance: the typical result of a perceptual process is\nbringing the perceived object under a perceptual concept. Genuine\nperception thus puts the premium in the perceived object, not in the\nperceptual activity itself or in the perceptual experience whereby one\nis typically brought into epistemic contact with one\u2019s\nextramental environment. Hence the typical result of perception is the\nacquisition of beliefs with contents expressible by sentences like\n(9)\u2013(13). If sentences reporting pain in body parts don\u2019t\nfollow this pattern, i.e., if they are not to be construed as reports\nof perceptual relations between the perceiver and the perceived, then\npain reports are prima facie not perceptual reports, reports\nto the effect that one stands in a perceptual relation to something\nextramental. But pain reports report feeling pain. Thus feeling pain\nis a not a form of genuine perception. Let us call this the\nargument from focus against perceptual theories.\n\nThere is an obvious sense in which the perceptual theorist is bound to\nconcede that reporting pain is not a case of reporting the obtaining\nof a perceptual relation between the perceiver and the extramental\nperceived object. For to the extent to which reporting pain is\nreporting a conscious experience and only that, to that extent it is\nan introspective report, a report of intramental activity.\nNevertheless, a perceptual theorist would insist that this reported\nexperience is a perceptual experience. But why report the experience,\nthe messenger, rather than its object, the message? Why are we fixated\non the messenger here?\n\nA natural explanation that a perceptual theorist might give is that\nunlike other perceptual modalities, the acts of sensing tissue damage\ninvolved in feeling pain (i.e., the experience) have a very pronounced\nnegative affective quality: pains are unpleasant, awful, hurtful,\npainful (see Pitcher 1970, p. 379ff; and Armstrong 1962, p. 125ff;\n1968, p. 310ff). It is this negative affect that explains why we are\nfixated on the experience itself, rather than what it is a perception\nof, i.e., traumatized body parts. In other words, it is this negative\nquality that turns the recognitional focus onto itself, and with it,\nonto the experience it attaches to. If this is correct, then, of\ncourse, pains are equally unpleasant even when they misrepresent. This\nis why we pick out our acts of sensing (i.e., the experiences\nthemselves) rather than their external objects irrespective of their\ninformational etiology: whether or not they are veridical, they\nequally hurt.\n\nThis seems to be a plausible explanation on a first pass. Indeed, a\nperceptual theorist can even give, plausibly, an evolutionary story\nabout why these perceptual experiences should feel unpleasant: they\nrepresent or signal a property of body parts that tends to hinder\nsurvival. However, can the same sort of explanation be given for other\nintransitive bodily sensations like itches, tickles, tingles, and\norgasms? Perhaps it can be done for experiencing orgasms, which are\nusually intensely pleasurable and has obvious evolutionary benefits\n(Block 1996, Tye 1996b, Aydede 2019). But what about others? Itches\nhave an unpleasant quality to them which normally makes one want to\nscratch the spot where one itches. But tickles and tingles can be\npleasant at times and unpleasant at others, as well as affectively\nneutral at still other times. Still, the concept of a tickle or tingle\nis like the concept of a pain in that they apply to the acts of\nsensing or experiencing, rather than to what external conditions these\nacts may be representing \u2014 if they represent\n anything.[18]\n Further, gustatory and olfactory experiences can be pleasant,\nunpleasant or affectively neutral, yet the acts of sensing involved in\nthe exercise of these sensory modalities seem to be largely\ntransparent in that we apply the relevant concepts like SWEET, BITTER,\netc. to the external objects of these experiences in the first\ninstance, and only derivatively or incidentally to the acts of sensing\nor to the experiences themselves.\n\nThese observations cast doubt on the plausibility of the explanation\noffered by the perceptual theorist for the asymmetry in focus.\nHowever, the perceptual theorist can still claim that whatever the\nexplanation might be in the case of other intransitive bodily\nsensations, the explanation offered for pain is essentially correct,\nand such a theorist may thus conclude that she has discharged the\nburden of proof in claiming that experiencing pain is engaging in\ngenuine exteroception. This reply has some initial plausibility since\npain experiences have almost always a pronounced negative affect.\nNevertheless, if one suspects \u2014 as one should \u2014 that the\nintransitivity of certain kinds of bodily sensations as a whole must\nhave a unified explanation, one would be wise to conclude that the\noffered explanation is probably not the whole story, and thus might\nnot be adequate all by itself.\n\nThere is also quite substantial scientific evidence that there are\nabnormal pain phenomena where the sensory and affective aspects of\npain experiences are dissociated from each other \u2014 see Section\n6.1 below for references and for further discussion. The most typical\ncase is known as the pain asymbolia syndrome, where people who suffer\nfrom it have pain experiences without the negative affect.\nInterestingly, these people still identify their experience as pain,\nbut show no bodily, emotional, and behavioral signs typically\nassociated with the unpleasant aspect of pains. They are feeling a\npain that doesn\u2019t hurt! If pains are not necessarily unpleasant,\nas this syndrome seems to show, it is an interesting and open question\nwhether feeling pains without its negative affect would still retain\nits intransitive nature.\n\nBut the real problem for this response that appeals to negative affect\nis that even if the provided explanation were correct, it would not\nsave a perceptual theory. The explanandum (namely, that the semantic\nfocus of spontaneous concept application in reporting pains is the\nexperience rather than the extramental object of this experience) can\nplausibly be interpreted as admission that feeling pain in a body part\nis not perceiving something extramental there. What justifies this\ninterpretation is a reasonable condition on genuine perception: an\nexperience kind is genuinely perceptual only if it generally gives\nrise to proprietary concept applications whose semantic focus is the\nproper object of this kind of experience. In other words, some\ncognitive uptake of a certain sort is necessary for a sensory process\nto become genuinely perceptual. Generally, concepts of secondary\nqualities are taken to be proprietary for each sensory modality.\nIndeed these concepts primarily apply to objects of experiences\ntypically generated by these modalities, rather than to the\nexperiences themselves (or if they do, only derivatively). But in the\ncase of pain, we don\u2019t seem to semantically apply PAIN, or\n\u2018pain\u2019 for that matter, to tissue damage. Again this is\nevidenced by the truth-conditions of pain attributing sentences, as\nwe\u2019ve seen before. So the explanans may be correct, but it seems\nto miss its target, the explanandum: it turns out to be an explanation\nof why feeling pain is not genuinely perceptual.\n\nAnother kind of response to the problem of focus might be to treat it\nas a pseudo problem that stems from our linguistic practices without\naffecting the phenomena. It might be argued in the following way\n(Chalmers in correspondence; cf. Hill 2006, 2009, 2017). We can invent\na term \u2018see2\u2019 such that one can see2\neven when the perceptual object is not present (so\n\u2018see2\u2019 applies to the visual experience, unlike\nthe ordinary \u2018see1\u2019). We can also invent a term\n\u2018feel1\u2019 such that feeling1 requires\nthe presence of the perceptual object, tissue damage (so\n\u2018feel1\u2019 is unlike the ordinary\n\u2018feel2\u2019). As it happens, in our language\n\u2018see\u2019 expresses \u201csee1\u201d and\n\u2018feel\u2019 expresses \u201cfeel2\u201d, but\nthat\u2019s just terminology. At the level of phenomena, the two\ncases are on a par.\n\nBut the problem won\u2019t go away with this maneuver. For one thing,\nit doesn\u2019t really address the anti-perceptualist argument from\nfocus given above. For another, the question isn\u2019t whether we\ncan or cannot invent new terms or form new concepts so that the two\nphenomena turn out to be type-identical. Linguistic practices reflect\nour conceptual practices, how we think and conceptually respond to\nincoming perceptual information. As a matter of fact, our conceptual\npractices treat seeing and other standard exteroception differently\nfrom the way they treat feeling pain, despite the fact that the types\nof information flow seem identical in both cases. The question is why?\nFor these practices are shaped by our epistemic needs and\npsychological preferences that show up in our behavior. They are not\narbitrary. If perception is a psychological process by which we gather\ninformation about the extramental world and align our conceptual and\nbehavioral responses on this basis in a certain way, it is a fair\nquestion to ask whether a psychological process that deviates from\nthis is perception, especially when the deviation seems to reflect\nthat our epistemic needs and psychological preferences are markedly\ndifferent than those involved in exteroception. The question of\nwhether feeling pain is perception is not a purely metaphysical or\nphilosophical question, but it is also partly and importantly an\nempirical (psychological) question.\n4.3 The problem of affective phenomenology\n\nPains are not only sensory or perceptual experiences, they are also\naffective-motivational experiences, or at least they seem to have an\naffective aspect. Feeling pain is normally having an awful, hurtful,\n\u2018painful,\u2019 experience. So we may say that pains have a\nnegative hedonic valence or affective value.\n\nStrong representationalists are committed to claiming that all aspects\nof phenomenology are representational. So if this negative affective\naspect of pain (i.e., the hurting, painful quality of pains) is a\nproper part of pain\u2019s overall qualitative phenomenology, then it\nmust also be representational. But what does it represent? Pain\nphenomenology seems complex in that it seems to consist of at least\ntwo dimensions, affective-motivational and sensory-discriminative.\nRepresentationalists, along with earlier perceptual theorists, claim\nthat the sensory aspect of pain is representational: it represents\ntissue damage. But what does the affective aspect represent? There\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be a plausible candidate.\n\nThe early perceptual theorists, especially direct realists, were\ncognitivist about pain\u2019s negative affect. They claimed,\nroughly, that it consists of the experiencer\u2019s spontaneous\ncognitive/conative reactions to their own pain experiences. These\nreactions were conceived as forming conative or evaluative\npropositional attitudes. In other words, the painfulness of pains\nwas constituted by their power to immediately \u201cevoke in [one]\nthe peremptory desire that the [pain] perception should cease\u201d\n(Armstrong 1968, pp. 314\u201316). (See also, Stephens and Graham\n1985, 1987; Nelkin 1986, 1994; Hall 1989. Cf. Parfit 1984. According\nto Chisholm\u2019s 1987 presentation, Brentano also held that pains\nand pleasures are partly conative reactions to sensory elements.)\n\nEven though theoretically cognitivism is an option for\nrepresentationalism, adopting it would seem to violate the spirit of\nstrong representationalism. It all depends on how one would like to\ndevelop the cognitivist line. One option is to say that the affective\naspect of pain is not qualitative or phenomenological. We are under\nthe illusion that it is because we are hard-wired to cognitively and\nbehaviorally react to the sensory content of pain in a certain way.\nThis option has the advantage of preserving strong\nrepresentationalism: if affect is not qualitative, there is no\npressure to treat it as representational \u2014 cf. Tye (1996, pp.\n111\u201316 and 134\u201336; 1997, p. 332\u20133). But if it is\nadmitted that affective aspect of pain is as qualitative as its\nsensory content, then cognitivism comes as a compromise for strong\nrepresentationalist because it admits that not all phenomenal\ncharacter is representational. This latter option may lead to\nrepresentational-cum-functionalist approaches to pains and other\naffectively non-neutral experiences in that the sensory content of an\nexperience may be given a purely representational account while its\naffective dimension may be a matter of functionally processing this\ncontent for setting motivational parameters (on the assumption that\ncognitive attitudes can be captured functionally).\n\nThe problem with cognitivism in general is that it suffers from\nintuitive implausibility: it certainly doesn\u2019t appear that the\nhurting aspect of pain experiences is just a matter of our\ncognitive reactions to them as ordinarily\nunderstood. Cognitive reactions in the form of propositional attitudes\ndon\u2019t seem to have much qualitative phenomenology peculiar to\nthem. But more importantly, this move appears to mislocate the\nproblem. The question is: in what does the painfulness, the hurting\nquality, of pains consist? The answer offered seems to be: in our\ncognitive/conative reaction to the experience, something like having a\ndesire for it to stop, for instance. But one would like to think that\nit is because the experience is painful that one desires it to stop,\nnot the other way round.\n\nThe most straightforward way to deal with affective phenomenology for\na representationalist is to say that it too is representational, just\nlike the sensory phenomenology. Tye seems to propose such a view:\n\n\nPeople in pain try to get rid of it or to diminish it. Why? The answer\nsurely is because pain feels unpleasant or bad, because it is\nexperienced as such. But what exactly is experienced as\nunpleasant? One\u2019s attention, when one feels pain, goes to a\nplace different from the one in which the experience of pain is\nlocated. The qualities that are experienced as unpleasant are located\nin the bodily location to which one attends (in normal circumstances).\nPeople whose pains lack the affective dimension undergo purely\nsensory, non-evaluative representations of tissue damage of one sort\nor another in a localized bodily region. Those whose pains are normal\nexperience the same qualities, but now those qualities are experienced\nby them as unpleasant. It is precisely because the qualities\nare experienced as unpleasant or bad that people have the cognitive\nreactions to them they do, reactions such as desiring to stop the\npain. To experience tissue damage as bad is to undergo an experience\nwhich represents that damage as bad. Accordingly, in my view, the\naffective dimension of pain is as much a part of the representational\ncontent of pain as the sensory dimension is. (Tye 2006a: 107)\n\n\nSo the experience I undergo when I feel a sharp pain in the back of my\nhand feels the way it does because it represents tissue damage in my\nhand and it represents it as bad. In other words, it represents tissue\ndamage as having the quality of being bad. (See also O\u2019Sullivan\n& Schroer 2012; Bain 2013, 2017.)\n\nOf course, normally having one\u2019s tissue damaged is bad. We also\nnormally think/judge that it is bad. Not only that, experiencing\ntissue damage (i.e., feeling pain) is bad. We think/judge so too. But\nit doesn\u2019t follow from these truisms (without additional\npremises) that the experience represents the damage as\nbad. These truisms should not be confused with this last claim,\nwhich is a substantive metaphysical claim. But what does it mean for\none\u2019s experience to represent tissue damage as bad?\n\nThis is a non-trivial question for a strong representationalist who\naspires to be a naturalist. Recall that strong representationalism\nusually comes with a naturalistic story about how experiences acquire\ntheir representational content. So it is important that representing\ntissue damage as bad can be cashed out in terms of whatever\nnaturalistic story a representationalist has in his disposal. Many\nrepresentationalists including Tye defend (or at least start with) an\ninformational theory. But what is the natural property of the tissue\ndamage itself that is detected or tracked by the experience so that we\ncan say the experience carries information about it? The\nproperty of being bad doesn\u2019t seem to be the kind of property\nthat can be informationally detected or transduced. Arguably, an\ninformation-theoretic version of representationalism seems not quite\nappropriate for affective phenomenology (but see Tye 2006b for a\nresponse \u2014 for different options and critical discussion, see\nBain 2017, Cutter & Tye 2014, and Corns 2018).\n\nBut perhaps a functional role semantics might work better for cashing\nout what it means for pain experiences to represent tissue damage as\nbad. The idea is that pain experiences play a certain\nfunctional/causal role in the behavioral and mental economy of their\nowners. In particular, given that they normally signal injury, such\nexperiences are typically causally associated with a certain battery\nof cognitive and behavioral effects. It might be claimed that this\ncausal or functional profile as a whole (rather than a mere\ninformational link) is what makes pain experiences represent\ntissue damage as bad.\n\nIt is not clear, however, whether representationalism is doing any\nwork in this proposal once an appeal to functionalism is made. For one\nthing, it transforms strong representationalism into a partly\ninternalist theory. For another, why not simply say that the\nfunctional role itself constitutes pain\u2019s affective\nphenomenology? Indeed, functionalism (or better: psychofunctionalism)\nin the philosophy of mind has always treated pains as paradigmatic\nexamples of qualitative mental states whose phenomenology can\nplausibly be captured by functionalist proposals. What made this prima\nfacie plausible was pain\u2019s affective phenomenology (as opposed\nto its sensory phenomenology), which is essentially connected with\npain\u2019s being an inherent motivator. But once functionalism is\nallowed, we don\u2019t need to make a detour via representationalism.\nIn fact, it is hard to see how an experience\u2019s representing\nsomething as bad can be an inherent motivator all by itself. To\nexplain how, a representationalist has to advert to additional\n(learning?) mechanisms to connect representational content with drive\nand motivation. (See Aydede & Fulkerson 2014, 2019 for an\nelaboration of a psychofunctionalist account of pain affect as well as\nfurther criticisms of representationalism from a functionalist\nperspective. See Corns 2014 for criticism.)\n5. Evaluative and motivational theories\n\nAlthough a functionalist treatment of affective phenomenology seems\nproblematic for pure strong representationalists, it may be welcomed\nby perceptual theorists in general who are seeking to give a\nnaturalistic account of pain as a perception. All they need to do to\naccommodate pain\u2019s affective phenomenology is to say that\nfeeling pain involves perception although perception doesn\u2019t\nexhaust its nature: feeling pain is also an affective/emotional\nexperience that can be explained by invoking other factors, say, the\nfunctional role of pain\u2019s sensory/representational content (see,\nfor example, Lycan 1987a, pp. 60\u201361 and Clark 2006, Aydede &\nFulkerson 2019 for proposals roughly along this line) or the\nevaluative representation of what the sensory-discriminative component\nof pain represents (e.g., the badness of tissue damage) \u2014 see\nbelow. Including the affective phenomenology, as we may recall, is\nwhat the IASP definition of pain seems to recommend. It seems also\nembedded in the common-sense conception of pain: pains are\nunpleasant.\n\nIndeed a number of theorists embraced this sort of approach that may\nbe usefully called \u2018mixed theories of pain\u2019. These come in\na variety of forms, sometimes motivated by different sets of concerns,\nand accordingly, emphasizing different aspects of pain. But the basic\nidea is that the nature of pain is complex consisting of at least two\nmental elements. Generally one element is characterized by using one\nor more of the following group of terms: sensory, perceptual,\nrepresentational, discriminating, descriptive, or informational. The\nother is characterized by one or more of the following: affective,\nemotional, motivational, evaluative, directive, or imperative. So far\nwe have been focusing on those theories that have emphasized the\nformer aspect. Indeed this has been the overwhelmingly dominant style\nof theorizing \u2014 at least in the philosophical tradition. But in\nthe last 10 years or so, there has been an increasing recognition of\nthe fact that pain has an affective and motivational aspect which\nseems at least prima facie distinct from its sensory or perceptual\naspect (see next section for some scientific evidence). As observed,\nmost perceptual theorists and weak representationalists could, and as\na matter of historical fact, did accommodate the affective\naspect of pain to various degrees of success \u2014 mostly, by going\ncognitivist as described above. \n\nNevertheless, in recent years, a number of theorists have focused more\non the affective aspect of pain experiences rather than on their\nsensory/perceptual aspect, perhaps feeling that it is this aspect that\nmakes pain experiences and other similar bodily sensations unique and\ndistinctive. There are historical precedents to this kind of approach\n(e.g., Marshall 1892, 1894a, 1894b; Duncker 1941), but I will focus on\ncontemporary developments of the view. (Corns 2013 contains a\ncriticism of unitary views of pain, and recommends a multi-dimensional\nview. In this vein, see also Borg et al., forthcoming, for a polyeidic\nmodel of folk conception of pain.)\n\nA good example is Nelkin 1994. Nelkin calls his theory, the\n\u2018evaluative theory of pain\u2019, according to which pain\nconsists of two components, one of which is an occurrent phenomenal\nstate representing various troubles in body parts. The second\ncomponent is a simultaneous and non-inferential evaluation of this\nphenomenal state. Nelkin conceives of this evaluation as a form of\nspontaneous de re judgment about the phenomenal state as\nrepresenting harm to the body. He thinks that both elements are\nnecessary for pain experience. Surprisingly, however, Nelkin claims\nthat the evaluative component should not be equated with affect and\nmotivation involved in experiencing pain. According to Nelkin, these\ntwo are only contingently related to pain experiences. (A similar view\nis presented in Hall 1989.) \n\nAnother evaluative theory is offered by Helm (2002) who develops the\nview in a more integrated fashion. According to Helm, bodily pains and\npleasures are just felt evaluations, spontaneous evaluations of what\nis happening in one\u2019s body as good or bad. According to Helm,\nthese evaluations aren\u2019t judgments understood ordinarily.\nNevertheless, they have intentional contents rationally responsive to\na broader range of background conative and cognitive states of the\nexperiencer. Thus as felt evaluations they inherently motivate and\nrationalize behavior typically associated with pain and pleasure.\nTherefore, they are not a separate or separable component of pain.\nPains and pleasure just are felt evaluations. Helm\u2019s\naccount is nuanced in many ways as it depends on his theory of\nemotions (Helm 2001). \n\nPerhaps the two most prominent proponents of a mixed evaluative view\nof pain, in recent years, are Michael Tye (2006a,b, Cutter & Tye\n2011) and David Bain (2003, 2013, 2017). Both defend strong\nrepresentationalism for both the sensory and affective components of\npains. Bain labels the position evaluativism and states it\nsuccinctly: \n\n\nA subject\u2019s being in unpleasant pain consists in his (i)\nundergoing an experience (the pain) that represents a disturbance of a\ncertain sort, and (ii) that same experience additionally representing\nthe disturbance as bad for him in the bodily sense. (Bain, 2013:\nS82)\n\n\nTye (2006a,b) and Cutter & Tye (2011) take the badness of physical\ndisorder to be an evolutionarily significant objective property of the\ndisturbance (such as aptness to harm), whereas Bain seems\nnon-committal about what the badness might eventually come to (but see\nhis 2017). (For recent criticisms of evaluativism, see Aydede &\nFulkerson 2019; Jacobson 2013, 2018; see Cutter & Tye 2014 for a\nresponse to Jacobson 2013. Jacobson 2018 additionally develops an\nattitudinal first-order anti-damage desire account of pain\naffect.)\n\nHall (2008), Martinez (2011), and Klein (2007) offer accounts of pain\nthat belong to the class of motivational theories. They call\ntheir views \u2018imperative\u2019 theories (or,\nimperativism as the views have come to be known), according\nto which pains are experiences with purely intentional content:\naccording to Hall and Martinez, pains have mixed intentional contents\npartly consisting of descriptive content, and partly of imperative\ncontent. On these views, pain experiences both represent\nactual or potential damage in body parts and command certain\nactions involving those parts such as: \u201cStop! Stop doing what\nyou\u2019re doing with this bodily part\u201d (Hall 2008: 534), or\n<See to it that this bodily damage is no more!> (Martinez\n2011).\n\nKlein (2007, 2015) further develops this imperative account of pain in\na more radical way: he proposes that pain experiences are exhausted by\ntheir imperative content alone. He claims that they have no\ndescriptive (in his words, representational) content at all. He\nintends his account in the same metaphysical spirit in which strong\nrepresentationalists present their account: the difference being in\nthe kind of intentional content pains have. According to strong\nrepresentationalists (in Klein\u2019s terminology, intentionalists),\nthis content is purely descriptive. According to Klein, it is purely\nimperative: a proscription against acting with bodily parts where pain\nis felt. In his 2015, Klein takes this imperative content to be a\nprotective command issued by the body to the agent: <protect\nthat body part in this way!>. Klein offers his\nimperativism as an account of the essential nature of pains\nwhich he takes to consist only in pains\u2019 sensory-discriminative\ncomponent. The affective, unpleasantness, aspect is only contingently\nrelated to pains, according to Klein, and consists of second-order\nagential level commands directed at the pain\u2019s imperative\ncontent. (For criticisms, see Bain 2011, Aydede [2017, in Other\nInternet Resources].)\n\nGustafson (2006) develops an extended and multi-stage argument against\nunderstanding pain as a sensory experience. On his view, pains are\nessentially emotions. \n\nWhen the naturalistic underpinnings of these evaluative and\nmotivational theories are explored, functionalist or\npsychofunctionalist reductions of the affective/evaluative dimension\nof pain might turn out to be the most natural option for these\ntheorists. (For general critical reviews of the class of recent\nevaluative and motivational accounts of pain, and in particular the\naffective aspect of pains, see Corns 2018, and Aydede & Fulkerson\n2019, the latter develop a psychofunctionalist and a first-order\nexperiential anti-damage desire account of sensory affect, including\npain affect.)\n6. Eliminativism about pain\n6.1 The argument from reactive dissociation for eliminating pain\n\nDaniel Dennett, in his influential article, \u201cWhy You Can\u2019t\nMake a Computer that Feels Pain\u201d (1978), argued that the\nordinary concept of pain is irremediably incoherent and should be\nabandoned. His argument relied on some clinical pain syndromes which\nhe dubbed the \u201creactive dissociation\u201d of pain affect from\nits sensory aspect.\n\nIt has been well known that certain surgical procedures, some drugs\nand certain pathological conditions reduce or remove the\nunpleasantness of pain while preserving its sensory-discriminative\naspect. These data typically come from patients who have undergone\nprefrontal lobotomy (Freeman et al. 1942; Freeman and Wattz 1946,\n1950; Hardy et al. 1952; Barber 1959; Bouckoms 1994) or cingulotomy\n(Foltz and White 1962a, 1962b; White and Sweet 1969) as a last resort\nfor their intractable chronic pain (as frequently involved in phantom\nlimb pain, neuralgia, causalgia, severe psychogenic and cancer pains),\nfrom patients under the effects of hypnotic suggestion (Barber 1964;\nRainville et al. 1997, 1999), nitrous oxide (laughing gas), and some\nopium derivatives like morphine (Barber 1959). These patients by and\nlarge claim that they are in pain, and they can recognize and identify\ntheir pain as such, but do not feel or seem bothered or distressed in\nways characteristic to having pain experiences.\n\nAlthough it is usually not recognized in the literature, there are\nimportant differences among the phenomena afflicting these patients,\nwhich are manifested in patients\u2019 reports and behavior. For\ninstance, pain asymbolia also typically produces a kind of\ndissociation \u2014 a rather strong kind \u2014 sometimes similar to\ncingulotomy patients\u2019 but interestingly different from lobotomy\npatients\u2019 (Rubins and Friedman 1948; Hurt and Ballantyne 1974;\nBerthier et al. 1988, 1990; Devinsky et al. 1995; Weinstein et al.\n1995). In fact, there is evidence that pain asymbolia may be the only\nform of genuine dissociation (Grahek 2007). These patients, for\ninstance, don\u2019t react even to momentary pains like pinpricks,\nsmall cuts, or burns. Experimental pain stimuli fail to produce any\nrecognizable affective reactions. Nevertheless, the patients insist\nthat the stimuli cause pain \u2014 they identify their experiences as\npain (Rubins and Friedman 1948; Berthier et al. 1988, 1990; Dong et\nal. 1994; Weinstein et al. 1995). The lobotomy and morphine patients,\non the other hand, do show the usual affective reactions and symptoms\nwhen they are stimulated momentarily by normally painful stimuli. But\nthey don\u2019t seem to care or be bothered by their standing\npersistent or chronic pains. Probably, they still feel the negative\naffect but don\u2019t mind it, whereas the pain asymbolia patients\ndon\u2019t even seem to feel the momentary negative affect.\n\nThese two cases also need to be distinguished from so-called\ncongenital insensitivity to pain, a condition where the patients\ndon\u2019t even report any pain experience upon various kinds of\nnoxious stimuli \u2014 unfortunately these patients don\u2019t live\nlong (McMurray 1955, 1975; Baxter and Olszewski 1960; Sternbach 1963;\nBrand and Yancey\n 1993).[19]\n\nIn his paper, Dennett primarily relies on the kind of dissociation\ninvolved in lobotomy and morphine cases and treats them as if they\ninvolved the same kind of strong dissociation involved in pain\nasymbolia. He also presents certain aspects of the gate-control theory\nof pain transmission developed by Melzack and Wall which had already\nstarted to revolutionize the scientific pain research (Melzack and\nWall 1965; Melzack 1973). Inspired by this theory, he then presents a\nspeculative subpersonal functional theory of pain processing,\naccording to which pain processing occurs in many functionally (even\nanatomically) different components of the central nervous system,\nmostly in parallel, such that some of them can be selectively\nimpaired. This kind of selective impairment, he says, can produce not\nonly dissociation of the kind we are familiar with, but many more\nbizarre phenomena we can expect to find and imagine happening. His\ninsight is that our ordinary notion of pain with its essentialist\nintuitions cannot withstand the implications of such scientific\ndevelopments in pain research.\n\nAccording to the common-sense concept of pain, Dennett argues,\n\n\n(14) pain experiences are essentially painful, awful,\nabhorrent, so that it is a logical impossibility to have an\naffectively neutral pain experience.\n\n\nBut it is also part of common sense that\n\n\n(15) a subject\u2019s access to her pain experiences is essentially\n\u201cprivileged or infallible or incorrigible\u201d (1978, p.\n226).\n\n\nIn the case of reactive dissociation (RD) patients, these two main\npillars of our ordinary concept of pain come into irremediable\nconflict according to Dennett. A totally alert and conceptually\ncompetent RD patient sincerely believes that (a) she is having a pain\nexperience, and that (b) her pain experience is not painful at all.\nGiven (14) and (a), we, as well as the patient, may conclude that she\nis having a painful pain experience. But this contradicts her belief\n(b) that is guaranteed to be true given (15). So we have a\ncontradictory concept of pain, which means that nothing can be a pain\n\u2014 an object or event with essentially contradictory properties\ncannot exist. Dennett also argues that the ordinary notion of pain\nwill not survive giving up either (14) or (15). So pains, as\nordinarily understood, do not exist. This is Dennett\u2019s\neliminativism about pain.\n\nOne way to respond to Dennett\u2019s challenge is to say that if the\ncommon-sense conception of pain did indeed require (14) and (15), then\nit was simply wrong (Kaufman 1985). So strictly speaking nothing\ncorresponds to the ordinary notion of pain. But given that pain\nexperiences are almost always unpleasant (in fact, always unpleasant\nin non-pathological cases), we can easily replace the faulty\nconception with a new one which is close enough not to cause alarm by\nits being empty \u2014 read (14) with \u2018normally\u2019 instead\nof \u2018essentially.\u2019 A similar line can be run for (15).\n\nAlternatively, one can argue against Dennett that (14) and (15) are\nnot really part of the common sense concept of pain (Conee 1984,\nKaufman 1985, Guirguis 1998). Indeed when we are told the complete\ndetails of what is going on in RD cases, there is no tendency to\nconclude that pains turn out not to exist. Rather, in such cases we\nrealize that pain phenomenology may be complex: what appears to be a\nsimple and homogenous phenomenology in casual introspection turns out\nto have a complex structure in close and trained inspection\n(challenging a strict reading of (15)). Then what the RD cases show is\nthat the affective aspect is not essential for an experience to be\nclassified as pain. Indeed such a conclusion was urged by early\nintrospectionist psychologists long before the discovery of reactive\ndissociation. So we learn that the identity of pain goes with its\nsensory aspect rather than its affective aspect (as, indeed,\nPloner\u2019s 1999 case study seems to show). Surprising, yes, but\nnothing like a major conceptual confusion. But part of Dennett\u2019s\noverall point should be granted in any case: the limit of what can be\nconceptually revised or abandoned as a result of scientific\ndevelopments may be much closer to home than we ordinarily tend to\nthink.\n6.2 Other arguments for eliminativism\n\nIn her book, The Myth of Pain (1999), Valerie Hardcastle also\nargued for eliminating the commonsense understanding of pain and much\nof the ordinary pain talk. She argues that the commonsense notion of\npain conceives of pains as simple subjective sensations devoid of any\ncomplexity. According to Hardcastle, pain is a complex phenomenon\nconsisting of many dissociable dimensions. To the two components\n(sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational) we discussed\nabove, she adds, following Melzack and Wall (1988) and others, a\ncognitive component (involving judgments, beliefs, memories,\nperception of environment and patient\u2019s own history). Hardcastle\nclaims that to the extent to which these components are ignored by the\ncommonsense conception of pain, to that extent it\u2019s inadequate.\nMoreover, on her view, it is a fatal mistake to take this subjective\nsensation of pain as the nature of pain because she thinks that a\nbiologically more realistic objective understanding of pain involving\nthe various systems processing nociceptive information will serve our\nscientific purposes much better and the commonsense understanding of\npain should follow that.\n\nJennifer Corns (2015) critically discusses both Dennett\u2019s and\nHardcastle\u2019s eliminativism about pain, and argues that we need\nto make a distinction between scientific eliminativism and traditional\neliminativism (about folk concepts). She argues that even if a case\nmay be made for scientific eliminativism about pain as a natural kind\n(see her 2012), nothing follows about eliminating the folk concept of\npain in so far as the latter serves a variety of useful functions in\nordinary life.\n\nThere are other ways of being eliminativist about pains having to do\nwith the nature of qualia or the alleged existence of apparent\nphenomenal objects. Some philosophers, feeling that qualia or\nphenomenal objects cannot be accommodated by an emerging scientific\nnaturalism, tend to conclude that they simply don\u2019t exist as we\nphilosophically conceive of them (Dennett 1988, Rey 1997). This is a\nparticularly vivid worry for intransitive bodily sensations in general\nand for pain in particular, because they seem to impress upon us as if\nin having them we were literally confronted with phenomenal objects\nthat cannot be part of the natural world order. If one comes to the\nconclusion that none of the theories offered has any chance of\nsucceeding in helping us understand how a purely physical world could\ncontain pains, tickles, itches, orgasms, etc., then one way to go is\nto say that they don\u2019t exist \u2014 rather than giving up on\nnaturalism or physicalism. But the issues here are more general,\npertaining to broader concerns in the philosophy of mind.\n7. Conclusion\n\nWhen we look at the science of pain, especially at what has happened\nsince the publications of Melzack and Wall\u2019s (1965) and Melzack\nand Casey\u2019s (1968), which revolutionized the scientific research\non pain, we see that the science of pain has increasingly conceived of\npain as less like perception of an objective reality and more like\nemotions (affective states) by first drawing the sensory/affective\ndistinction and then emphasizing more and more its affective aspect.\n(For a review see Price 1999. See Gustafson 2006 for a sustained\nargument that pain is primarily an emotion. A.D. Craig 2003 claims on\nscientific grounds that pains are homeostatic emotions. See also\nChapman & Nakamura 1999 as well as Vogt 2005 for scientific\ngrounds linking pain to emotion.) As we have seen, the trend in\nphilosophy, until very recently, had been in the other direction: as\nnaturalism has started to become an orthodoxy in the second part of\nthe 20th century, philosophers have increasingly sought for ways in\nwhich they could assimilate pain to ordinary perception like vision,\naudition, etc.\n\nOne of the main motivations behind the perceptual/representational\nviews of pain in philosophy is the belief (or hope) that perception as\na species of information gathering can be accounted for entirely in\nphysicalistic terms. Of course, this is a controversial claim. There\nare many who think that perception involving as it does conscious\nphenomenal experience cannot be a purely physical\n phenomenon.[20]\n However, even these theorists may agree that it is a plausible\ntheoretical strategy to pursue an understanding of pain and other\nintransitive bodily sensations in perceptual/representational terms.\nThis strategy, if it works, minimizes the diversity of mental\nphenomena, and thus potentially offers the prospects of a more unified\ntheory of mind. If this theory turns out to be in harmony with the\nrest of our sciences and their fundamental metaphysical and\nmethodological assumptions, so much the better. Indeed, it was the\nplausibility of this strategy and the belief that we will eventually\nsucceed in understanding perception in purely naturalistic terms that\nhave prompted many philosophers to advance perceptual/representational\ntheories of pain. Many in fact believe that philosophy has made some\nprogress in the second half of the last century in developing the\nconceptual tools for a better and more naturalistic understanding of\nperception and the mind in general \u2014 e.g., the notion of a\nmental representation and its (broadly) computational processing.\n\nBut does the scientific trend towards understanding pain as a\nsubjective experience less like a perception and more like an emotion\nwith quite a variable link to injurious stimuli undermine the\nphilosophical project? There is no simple answer. We may say,\n\u201cyes it does,\u201d if we take the perceptual/representational\ntheories as making the strong claim that pain is strictly nothing but\na perception just like other standard perceptions. We may say,\n\u201cno it doesn\u2019t\u201d if we take their claim in a weaker\nsense to the effect that pain involves some form of\nperception understood in a certain way (on the assumption that the\nperceptualists can answer other arguments against their views, such as\nthe argument from focus). Nothing in the scientific understanding of\npain by itself seems to show that pain involves no sensory perception\nat all. On the contrary, as the science of pain has unearthed in the\nlast fifty years or so, there are relatively specialized systems that\nprocess noxious stimuli from the moment they affect peripheral\nreceptors to the central processing of these signals in the spinal\ncord and the brain.\n\nIf we take the weaker claim to the effect that feeling pain involves\nsensory perception but that this doesn\u2019t exhaust its nature\nmostly due to its affective dimension, we may still preserve a\nnaturalistic view of pain by giving a functionalist (or,\npsychofunctionalist) account of its affective aspect. According to\nthis proposal, even though the sensory-discriminative aspect of pain\ncan perhaps be handled\n representationally,[21]\n the affective aspect reduces to the way in which the\nsensory-discriminative information is processed, not for analysis to\nextract information about the proximal or distal properties of the\nstimuli, but rather for its significance for learning as well as the\neffector or motor systems, to set learning and motivational parameters\nfor action on the basis of stimuli\u2019s informational content.\nThere is in fact strong supporting evidence for such a thesis in the\nevolutionary stories of different organisms at different developmental\nhierarchies. The neuroscientific evidence about the affective brain\nseems also to support this idea in\n general.[22]\n\nThis is a view that treats pain as both a weakly representational and\na functional state. Such a view still needs to provide a good answer\nto the problem of focus that we have seen afflicts all\nperceptual/representationalist views. Why is there an asymmetry in\nconcept application, or in the focus of conceptual categorization?\nPointing out that pain has a deeply pronounced negative affect seems\nnot entirely adequate even when we have an adequate account of what\nthis affect consists in.\n\nThese are the major questions that an adequate perceptual account of\npain ought to give satisfactory answers to. Thus, despite significant\nadvances in our philosophical and scientific understanding of pain in\nthe last fifty years or so, there is still a lot of work to be done to\ndevelop a fully satisfactory account of pain.\n\nThere are other philosophical as well as scientific questions about\npain. Do animals feel pain? If they do, is it comparable to the way we\nfeel pain? What are the social, economical, ethical and religious\nimplications of affirmative answers to these questions? How can animal\npain be scientifically studied? What should be the methodology of\nscientific research on animals in general and of animal pain in\nparticular? How can we project the results obtained by pain research\non animals onto humans (or vice versa)? Parallel or similar questions\narise in the case of fetuses and young infants that are even more\npressing and urgent for obvious reasons. What is the relationship\nbetween pain and pleasure, or pain and emotions in general? What are\nthe ethical and religious significance and implications of pain? These\nand many other questions remain to be the focus of many researchers in\nthe field.
