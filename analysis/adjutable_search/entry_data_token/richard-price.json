Life, Works, and General Overview\n\nPrice was born in Llangeinor, Wales, the son of a dissenting minister.\nHe was initially educated privately, but after the death of his\nparents was encouraged by an uncle to attend the dissenting academy in\nMoorfields, London. In 1744 Price became family chaplain to George\nStreatfield at Stoke Newington. His duties were not onerous, leaving\nhim ample time for study. It was here that he began what became his\nmost important work: A Review of the Principal Questions in\nMorals (1758; 3rd. ed. 1787). In its main doctrines\nPrice was strongly influenced by Ralph Cudworth, whose Treatise\nConcerning Eternal and Immutable Morality was published\nposthumously in 1731. In 1757 Streatfield died and, his financial\ncircumstances having improved, Price married Sarah Blundell in June of\nthat year and became, shortly after, the minister in Newington Green,\nwhere he remained for most of his life.\n\nPrice became a leading figure in liberal intellectual groups,\nespecially the \u201cBowood Circle\u201d, which was named after the\nhouse of its leader, Lord Shelburne, and included Joseph Priestley and\nBenjamin Vaughan. He also belonged to the group that Benjamin Franklin\ndubbed the \u201cClub of Honest Whigs\u201d: a dining group\nrevolving round John Canton, which included some other members of the\nBowood Circle. Other prominent visitors or acquaintances included the\neminent politicians, Lord Stanhope, William Pitt the Elder, and the\nprison reformer John Howard, as well as David Hume, and Adam\nSmith.\n\nPrice was a keen supporter of both the American and French\nrevolutions. In early 1776 he published Observations on the Nature\nof Civil Liberty, followed by Additional Observations in\nthe next year. In 1784 he added Observations on the Importance of\nthe American Revolution. Price\u2019s support of the colonies\nearned him the friendship of many of the leading figures in the\nrebellion, including Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, and Paine. His\nsupport led to his being invited by the Continental Congress to assist\nin the financial administration of the States, and to his being\nawarded an honorary LL.D. by Yale University (1781, the other honoree\nthat year being George Washington), to add to the honorary doctorates\nhe had already received from Aberdeen and Glasgow Universities. When\nLord Shelburne became Prime Minister in 1782 he offered Price the post\nof his private secretary, which Price refused.\n\nHis published sermon, A Discourse on the Love of our Country\n(1789), defending the French revolution, ignited a pamphlet war,\nincluding Burke\u2019s famous and furious response in Reflections\non the Revolution in France (1790), as well as equally passionate\ndefenses by his friends Thomas Paine in Rights of Man (1791),\nand Mary Wollstonecraft in A Vindication of the Rights of Men\n(1790).\n\nA central aspect of Price\u2019s dissension from the doctrines of the\nChurch of England was his rejection of Trinitarianism. For the\nTrinitarian, the Godhead is three persons in one substance, so that\nChrist is fully God as well as fully man. For the Socinian, by\ncontrast, Jesus is merely human: a supreme teacher and exemplar of how\nto live, but nothing more. Price takes a position between these\nextremes. Christ is creator and judge, who descended from heaven and\nbecame man. He is not God, but the Messiah, and is on no account to be\nworshipped. When it comes to Christ\u2019s redemptive power, Price\nagain steers a middle course between the Socinian view that Christ\nsaves by precept and example, so that his death was not necessary to\nsalvation, and the Calvinist claim that redemption is wholly the work\nof God, who saves whom he will save, and damns whom he will damn (see\nRomans 9:18). For Price, salvation requires the cooperation\nof both parties. The sinner must of his own free will repent and\nstrive for righteousness, but God is not required to accept\nrepentant sinners, for repentance does not wipe out the consequences\nof sin. God wipes out all guilt as a reward to Christ for his perfect\nobedience.\n\nIn line with Cudworth, Clarke, and many others, Price rejected\ntheological voluntarism: the view that the precepts of morality depend\non God\u2019s will. The fundamental principles of morality are\nnecessary, and thus eternal and immutable. The standard objection to\nthis view is that it limits the sovereignty of God by making him\nsubject to moral demands that are not dependent on him. Price\u2019s\nresponse to this difficulty lies in his claim that, since God\nis eternal truth and reason, and since reason must recognize\nmoral obligations, moral constraints are part of God\u2019s nature,\nand not distinct from it. Nothing external to God constrains him.\n\nIn addition to his writings on ethics, theology, and politics, Price\ncorresponded at length with Joseph Priestley on the topic of free\nwill; their correspondence was published in 1778. He was also a\npioneer in probability theory, and edited Thomas Bayes\u2019 major\nwork An Essay Towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of\nChances (1763). As a consequence of his important introduction to\nBayes\u2019 essay he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in\n1765. His statistical work led to an interest in demography and\nactuarial calculations. His foundational book, Observations on\nReversionary Payments (1771) was in use for about a century, as\nwas his life table compiled by data he drew from a study of\nNorthampton. His Essay on the Population of England\n(2nd ed. 1780) influenced Thomas Malthus. His concern about\nthe failure of successive governments to tackle the mounting national\ndebt led to his publication, in the same year, of his Appeal to\nthe Public on the Subject of the National Debt (1771), which may\nhave influenced William Pitt the Younger to re-establish the sinking\nfund for the extinction of the national debt.\n\nIt is Price\u2019s views on ethics that remain most relevant to\ncontemporary philosophy, so that will be the central focus of this\nentry, which will also cover his political theory, theology, and\nhis position on free will.\n2. Price\u2019s Moral Philosophy\n2.1 Overview\n\nPrice can be classified as an Ethical Intuitionist in two respects.\nFirst, he rejects empiricism about our acquisition of knowledge, and\nespouses an intuitionist epistemology in ethics. Empiricists are\nmistaken in thinking that all knowledge has its basis in experience.\nThere are a number of substantial necessary truths, essential to\nrational thought, which cannot be established by empirical methods,\nbut which are self-evident. Reflection on them is sufficient to\nestablish their truth. These include, as well as some mathematical and\nmetaphysical truths, a number of fundamental moral principles.\n\nEmpiricism is also mistaken in its account of concept acquisition.\nThere are certain simple concepts that cannot be acquired by\nabstraction from sensory data or from reflecting on the mind\u2019s\nown operations. Among these are the basic concepts of ethics denoted\nby words such as: \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwrong\u201d,\n\u201cgood\u201d, \u201cbad\u201d, \u201cobligation\u201d. While\nnothing in experience itself answers to these concepts, they can be\ngrasped and applied correctly by the understanding to pick out genuine\nproperties of agents and actions. Since we possess these moral\nconcepts, which cannot arise in the ways that empiricists allow, the\nempiricism to which Locke and Hume subscribe must be false.\n\nAre these sufficient grounds for rejecting empiricism as a\nmethodology? If moral concepts were alone in presenting a difficultly\nfor empiricism, then there might be grounds for maintaining that\nepistemology, and either denying that there are moral concepts, or at\nleast denying that we have moral knowledge. Price\u2019s main\nargument against empiricism about concept acquisition consists in\nfinding what Mackie later called companions in guilt; i.e., other\nconcepts which are indispensable, and which we happily use, that\ncannot be explained on empiricist epistemology of this sort.\nPrice\u2019s rather familiar examples include: solidity, substance,\npower, cause, duration, inertia, infinity, number, identity, equality,\nand all modal concepts. If empiricists are successfully to defend\ntheir methodology they must either show that the concepts in question\ncan be explained on their epistemology, or bite the bullet and deny\nthat we do have any clear understanding of concepts like these or, at\nleast, that our ideas about such matters are confused or misleading.\nFor Price, by contrast, it is the understanding (a branch of\nreason), and not sense experience, that is the source of such\nconcepts.\n\nPrice is also an Intuitionist in a second and quite different sense in\nthat he embraces pluralism about basic duties. Those of a utilitarian\npersuasion held that all our duties were founded in one fundamental\nduty: to be benevolent, in the sense of promoting the well-being of\nall parties impartially. Price denies this. He contends, first, that\nwe have a duty to give preference to the welfare of some rather than\nothers; second, that there are duties that are quite distinct from\nbenevolence. On the first count, we have positional duties to God, to\nourselves, and to those with whom we have a special relationship. On\nthe second, there are some duties, such as gratitude, veracity, and\njustice, which are quite distinct from benevolence. Indeed, Price\nclaims, our duties to God do not even include benevolence; it does not\nmake sense to suppose we can benefit God, or increase his\nhappiness, by our obedience and worship.\n\nPrice recognizes that our various duties may conflict in a particular\ncase: the only way to prevent harm may be to lie; acting justly may be\nimprudent, and so on. He maintains that in some cases one duty is\nclearly weightier than another and no perplexity arises. But there are\nmany cases where it is not clear what is the right thing to do, and\nconscientious people may differ as to which duty should give way in\nsuch cases. There is always a determinate answer to the question of\nwhich action is right, but as finite creatures we may lack penetration\nand wisdom to discern it. Doubt about what we should do in a\nparticular case should not, however, infect our confidence in the\nexistence of objective moral truth, for the fundamental principles\nthat we bring to bear on particular cases are self-evident.\n\nThese claims have been made familiar in more recent times by W. D.\nRoss, and consequently much debated, so the focus in what follows will\nbe on what is peculiar to Price\u2019s views.\n2.2 Moral Epistemology and Metaphysics\n\nAs a moral realist, Price rejects all forms of voluntarism, all forms\nof the self-interest theory, as well as all forms of the\nsentimentalist theories of Hutcheson and Hume. A central plank in his\narguments against the first two of these positions is what would later\nbecome known as the Open Question Argument. Indeed it is Price, and\nnot Moore, that should be credited with its discovery. Price\u2019s\nchallenge, like Moore\u2019s, poses a dilemma for his opponent.\nEither the opponent is offering an account of what constitutes\nrightness and wrongness, or she is offering an account of what\nmakes actions right and wrong. Either answer leads to\ndifficulties. Embracing the first horn leaves the proponent open to\nthe Open Question Argument.\n\n\nAs to the schemes which found morality on self-love, on positive laws\nand compacts, or the Divine Will; they must either mean, that moral\ngood and evil are only other words for advantageous and\ndisadvantageous, willed and forbidden. Or\nthey relate to a very different question; that is, not to the\nquestion, what is the nature and true account of virtue; but\nwhat is the subject-matter of it.\n\nAs far as the former may be the intention of the schemes \nI have mentioned, they afford little room for controversy. Right and wrong\nwhen applied to actions which are commanded or forbidden by the will\nof God, or that produce good or harm, do not signify merely, that such\nactions are commanded or forbidden, or that they are useful or\nhurtful, but a sentiment concerning them and our consequent\napprobation or disapprobation of the performance of them. Were not\nthis true, it would be palpably absurd in any case to ask, whether it\nis right to obey a command, or wrong to disobey it;\nand the propositions, obeying a command is right, or\nproducing happiness is right, would be most trifling. (R\n16)\n\n\n(As Raphael points out, it is clear from the rest of the book that by\n\u201csentiment\u201d, Price here means opinion, not feeling.)\n\nIf, however, the self-interest theorist, or the utilitarian, takes the\nsecond horn, and is propounding a substantial moral theory about what\nmakes actions right or wrong, then she will have to show that her\ntheory survives critical reflection. Is it really true that we have no\nreason to do anything unless it is in our self-interest, or unless it\nproduces happiness? Price is confident that the answer to these\nquestions is in the negative, but they can be answered only by careful\nthought about our actual moral judgments.\n\nWhether Price's argument is successful depends on the soundness of the\nOpen Question Argument about which there is continuing\ndisagreement. Price has, however, other arguments against\nsentimentalism in particular, which is his main target in this\nbook. The disagreement concerns the metaphysical status of moral\nattributes: are they genuinely properties of actions and agents, or\nare they best understood as projections of our feelings or sentiments\nonto actions and agents?\n2.2.1 The battle with sentimentalism\n\nThroughout the eighteenth century there was considerable disagreement,\nwhich continues today, between sentimentalists and rationalists, about\nthe basis or origin of morals. On the sentimentalist side were those,\nsuch as Hutcheson and Hume, who thought that our moral faculty was\ngrounded, not in our ability to reason, but in our capacity to\nexperience emotions, and pleasure or displeasure\u2014in short, in\nour sentiments. \u201cMorality is more properly felt than judged\nof\u201d (Hume 1739\u201340: 470; Book III, Part I, Section 2). We\nare so constituted that we take pleasure in contemplating some\ncharacters and actions, while we are displeased by others. Reason does\nindeed play a role in moral agency, but a subordinate one. Once our\nfeelings have selected our ends, then we need to use reason to find\nsuitable means to those ends. Despite some differences, most humans\nshare many of their basic emotional responses; we tend to care about\nthe same things. It is in virtue of this widespread agreement that\nthere can be a shared standard of morality. But such agreement is\ncontingent; we can imagine agents very different from ourselves in\ntheir emotional make-up. If other agents share our moral outlook it\nwill not be in virtue of our common rationality, but as a result of\ntheir having a similar range of affective responses to us.\n\nA main strength of sentimentalism is the apparent ease with which it\ncan explain how our moral attitudes typically motivate us. Since moral\nattitudes are expressions of the affective rather than the cognitive\nsides of our nature, there is nothing puzzling about how our desires\nand aversions, likes and dislikes, approvings and disapprovings, can\nplay a motivational role. Rationalism, by contrast, is frequently\ncharged with being unable to explain the connection between morality\nand motivation. On the rationalist account, it seems, it must be\npossible to know what is right or wrong and not care in the least.\n\nIn opposition to sentimentalism were ranged those, such as Cudworth,\nClarke, Balguy, and Price, who adhered to the more traditional view\nthat moral distinctions are perceived by reason, and that reason has\nauthority to direct our lives. Reason tells us what goals we should\naim at, as well as how best to achieve them. It has motivational\npower.\n2.2.2 The battle with sentimentalism: defense\n\nPrice offers both defensive and offensive strategies against\nsentimentalism. On the defensive side, he tries to meet the following\nobjections to his view.\n\n How can reason, rather than our feelings of approval and\ndisapproval, be the origin of our moral concepts?\n How can we discern moral properties and make true moral claims\nabout them?\n What is the connection between feeling and cognition?\n How can reason move us to act?\n\n\nI briefly discussed the first two questions in\n \u00a72.1.\n It turns out that the last two are connected.\n\nSentimentalists claim that we adopt a moral stance in virtue of our\nhaving feelings of approval or disapproval towards an object, action,\nor practice. Price maintains that this gets things the wrong way\nround: we have feelings of approval towards an action or a person,\nbecause we apprehend that the action is right, or the person\nmorally praiseworthy.\n\n\nI cannot perceive an action to be right without approving it;\nor approve it, without being conscious of some\nsatisfaction and complacency. \u2026 To behold\nvirtue is to admire it. (R 59) \n\nWhen we are conscious that an action is fit to be done, or\nthat it ought to be done, it is not conceivable that we can\nremain uninfluenced, or want a motive to action.\n\u2026 An affection or inclination to rectitude cannot be separated\nfrom the view of it. (R 186\u20137)\n\n\nFurther, to recognize an action as right, or wrong, is to\nrecognize that one has an obligation to do it, or refrain from doing\nit.\n\n\n[V]irtue, as such, has a real obligatory power. (R 105)\n\nFrom the account given of obligation, it follows that\nrectitude is a law as well as a rule to us;\nthat it not only directs, but binds all, as far as\nit is perceived \u2026 Reason is the guide, the natural and\nauthoritative guide of a rational being. (R 108)\n\nHow absurd it is to enquire, what obliges us to practise\nvirtue? \u2026 [I]t is the very same as to ask, why are we\nobliged to do what we are obliged to do. (R 110)\n\n\nIn the passages above, Price is making three claims that are, on his\nview, inseparable. The first is an espousal of motivational\ninternalism about obligation. To recognize an action as morally\nrequired (or forbidden) is to be motivated to do it (or\nabstain from doing it). The second is a claim about the connection\nbetween cognition and feeling: the recognition of the moral character\nof an action necessarily arouses appropriate feelings in us.\nWe cannot, for example, breach the moral law without suffering remorse\nand pain. Thirdly, he takes it that, if we are morally\nobliged to act then we are obliged to act, period. Why? Because the\nprinciples of morality are principles of reason; thus we have decisive\nreason to do what morality dictates. For some philosophers, the\nquestion of what I ought to do has a moral and a deliberative reading.\nOnce I have determined what morality requires of me, the\ndeliberative question of what, all things considered, I should do is\nstill open. Price denies this gap. For him the question of why I ought\nto do what I morally ought to do makes no sense, for it is simply\nasking why I ought to do what I ought.\n\nIn more modern parlance, Price is claiming that, in our practical\ndeliberations, the notions of obligation and duty, right and wrong, are\nnormative ones. Normative features are internally tied to\n(motivation to) action, since to think one ought or should do\nsomething is to think there are decisive reasons to do it, and to\nthink there is decisive reason to do something is, ceteris\nparibus, to do it. This analysis supplies Price with an answer to\nthe challenge that Rational Intuitionists are unable to explain how\nawareness of moral facts is sufficient to motivate us. Although moral\nweakness may cause us to fail to do what we recognize we have decisive\nreason to do, no rational creature can be wholly unmoved by the\nawareness that she has such reason, and if she fails to act she is\nless than fully practically rational in this respect.\n\nThese claims are, of course, controversial, and there is no space to\ndiscuss them here. But we might note that Price\u2019s position is as\nold as Western Philosophy itself. It is, at its heart, a Platonist\nview of value. Rational beings cannot fail to love and be moved by\nwhat is good; if they love less than they should it is because they\nare not fully rational agents.\n2.2.3 The battle with sentimentalism: offense\n\nHutcheson, and following him, Hume, hold that there is an implanted\nmoral sense, the deliverances of which guide us in matters of\nmorals. For Hutcheson, there are more than the five senses. As well as\ntouch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing, there is, for example, the\nsense of beauty. Certain objects afford aesthetic delight, while\nothers disgust us. The operation of all senses depends on the actual\nconstitution of human nature, and that is a contingent matter. It is\nperfectly conceivable that, like the dung beetle, we should find the\nsmell of faeces attractive. Similarly, on this view, the structure of\nour moral sense depends on contingent facts about our affective\nresponses. It is this aspect of the view that Price finds most\nintolerable: had our emotional reactions been different then we would\nhave had a different moral sense, which would have been no better or\nworse than the one we have\u2014simply different.\n\nAre our moral judgments the product of sense or of understanding?\nPrice\u2019s main argument for the latter view is an appeal to moral\nphenomenology. It is, he asserts, \u201cscarcely conceivable\u201d\nthat on careful introspection someone should ascribe to the view that\n\n\n\nwhen he thinks gratitude or beneficence to be right, he\nperceives nothing true of them, and understands\nnothing, but only receives an impression from a sense. (R 44)\n\n\n\nIn short, Price offers the by now very familiar challenge to the\nsentimentalist or expressivist to explain how it is, if her view is\ncorrect, that we speak and think as if moral judgments are true or\nfalse independently of what anyone feels on these matters.\n\nThe moral sense theorist offers our awareness of color, sound, and smell as\na model or analogy by which to understand the sentimentalist account\nof moral properties.\n\n\nVice and virtue, therefore, may be compared to sounds, colours, heat\nand cold, which, according to modern philosophy, are not qualities in\nobjects, but perceptions in the mind. (Hume 1739\u201340: 469;\nIII.i.1)\n\n\nThat is, they are akin to secondary rather than primary qualities.\nPrice, in his criticism of the moral sense theorist fastens on to this\nanalogy. However, the cogency of Price\u2019s objections is somewhat\nclouded by the fact that both parties subscribe to a controversial and\nrather implausible account of secondary qualities. To appreciate this\npoint, we need to say more about the then widely accepted distinction\nbetween primary and secondary qualities that had its origin in\nLocke.\n\nOur sense-organs enable the mind to receive ideas of objects and\nevents in our immediate environment. Some of these ideas, those of the\nprimary properties or qualities, such as shape, size, and solidity,\nare both caused by and standardly resemble those qualities as\nthey actually are in the objects themselves. Thus the computer screen\nI am looking at now looks oblong and is oblong.\nUnder ideal conditions, the way the primary qualities of an object\nappear accurately represent its real nature, both as portrayed by\ncommon sense and as understood by scientific investigation. By\ncontrast, the ideas of secondary qualities do not resemble the\nproperties in the object that cause us to have those ideas. There is\nnothing in the objects themselves that resembles our ideas of color,\nsound, and so on. The story, as revealed by scientific investigation,\nof what is going on in the physical world when someone sees a red\nball, or smells the aroma of their morning coffee, would not mention\ncolors or smells at all. Rather, the objects in question are so\nconstituted that, in suitable conditions, they emit waves or particles\nthat stimulate the sense-organs in certain ways causing us to have the\ncharacteristic secondary quality experience. The full scientific\naccount of how this happens is complicated, more complicated than\npeople in Locke\u2019s time realized, but however the story goes,\nthere will be nothing in the world at all like colors-as-we-see-them,\nor sounds-as-we-hear-them. Since the ideas of secondary qualities that\narise in our minds when our sense-organs are stimulated depend on the\nnature and constitution of our sensory apparatus, as well as on the\nnature of external reality, it follows that creatures whose\nsense-organs differ from ours would have a different kind of secondary\nquality experience. Nor is this merely a thought experiment; it seems\nthat insects, for example, make color distinctions that do not match\nours in significant respects.\n\nSo far, the theory has talked about the ideas of secondary\nqualities, and their relation to the physical goings on that lead to\nthese ideas arising in the mind. But what are colors, sounds,\nand smells? Two accounts can be found in Locke. First, there is the\ndispositional theory: secondary qualities are powers or dispositional\nproperties in the object to produce certain ideas in us. Thus to say\nthat something is, for example, red is to say that it has a capacity\nor power, based in the physical microstructure of its surface, to\ncause the characteristic idea of red in normal human observers in\nstandard conditions. Second, there is the subjective theory: colors,\nsounds, etc. are not in objects; rather, they are identified\nwith the ideas in the perceiving subject caused by those objects. Both\naccounts exist in tension in Locke, though it is now generally agreed\nthat the former view represents his \u201cofficial\u201d position.\nThe dispositional account has the advantage of preserving the truth of\nmany of the things that we want to say about secondary qualities: for\nan object standardly retains a power even when it is not being\nexercised. Salt is soluble whether or not it is immersed in water; red\nobjects remain red under lighting conditions that make them look a\ndifferent color, or even in the absence of light. But the subjective\naccount gained considerable currency through the writings of Berkeley\nand Hume, who took it to be the one Locke was offering.\n\nThe subjectivist allows that we do normally take colors, sounds, and smells\nto be properties of things existing outside of us; similarly, we take\nright and wrong, vice and virtue, to be properties of actions and\nagents. In both cases, the sentimentalist claims, we are mistaken, and\nin virtue of a similar mechanism in each case. We project the contents\nof the mind on to reality; or, as Hume rather charmingly puts it\n(1739\u201340, 167; 1.3.14), the mind has a tendency to \u201cspread\nitself on external objects\u201d. In both cases, reflection shows\nthat, contrary to the way they are presented in experience, these\nfeatures in fact have no existence outside the mind. If we can be\nmistaken in the case of secondary qualities, we can equally be mistaken in the\ncase of moral qualities, so the moral phenomenology to which Price\nappeals is no more decisive in the one case than the other. Since\nPrice accepts the subjective account of secondary qualities, he would\nseem to be vulnerable to this riposte.\n\nIn response, Price denies that the two cases are parallel. The reason\nwe must reject the phenomenology in the case of secondary qualities is\nthat the ascription of them to objects is seen, on philosophical\nexamination, to be incoherent. This is not so in the case of\nmoral properties. Since it makes sense to suppose that they are\nproperties of actions and agents, we have no reason, in their case, to\nreject the phenomenology as mistaken.\n\n\nA coloured body, if we speak accurately, is the same\nabsurdity with a square sound. We need no experience to prove\nthat heat, cold, colours, tastes, etc. are not real qualities of\nbodies; because the idea of matter and of these qualities are\nincompatible. But is there indeed any such incompatibility between\nactions and right? Or any such absurdity in\naffirming the one of the other? Are the ideas of them as different as\nthe idea of a sensation and its cause? (R 46)\n\n\nWhat is it about secondary qualities that makes the supposition that\nthey are properties of matter absurd? Price\u2019s argument has two\npremisses. First, only conscious beings can have sensations:\n\n\nSensations, as such, are modes of consciousness, or feelings of a\nsentient being, which must be of a nature totally different from the\nparticular causes which produce them. (R 46)\n\n\nSecond, colors, sounds, tastes, smells, are sensations. Price uses the\nexample of pleasure and pain to illustrate the point. The entry of the\nknife into the body causes the person to feel pain, but it is absurd\nto think that the pain might be a property of the knife; pains can\nonly be a property of conscious perceivers. But the colors we see and\nthe sounds we hear are equally sensations. Therefore, it is\nincoherent to suppose that they might be properties of\nmatter.\n This argument appears to beg the question. Price\u2019s objection\ncomes to this: we know a priori that realism is an error in\nthe case of secondary qualities, but it remains an open\nquestion whether it is an error in the case of moral properties.\nBut the sentimentalist can maintain that, strictly speaking, the one\nidentification is as much a metaphysical error as the other, though we\nmake them often enough in ordinary life. It only seems to Price to be\nan open question in the moral case because he rejects the metaphysics\nof the sentimentalist.  But that is precisely what is in dispute. If\nmoral properties are affective responses, it is incoherent to ascribe\nthem to objects.\n\nThere is much that is confused in this dispute between Price and the\nsentimentalists. Conscious states are properties of the perceiver, and\nnot of the perceived object, but the claim that colors, sounds, and\nsmells are essentially conscious states is not well supported. Nor\nshould the ideas of these properties be classified\nas sensations, on the model of pleasure and pain. It is\nnoteworthy that, whereas no-one supposes that the sensations of\npleasure and pain can be predicated of whatever causes the pain, this\nis not true of colors, tastes, and sounds. But if it is as absurd to\nsuppose that a body is colored as it is to suppose that what causes us\npain is itself in pain, why is the first identification so often made\nand the second not? There must be some difference between the two\ncases that explains this tendency, but any such difference casts doubt\non the claim that they should be regarded as being equally\nsensations.\n\nSuppose the sentimentalist were to switch to the more plausible\ndispositional account of both secondary qualities and moral\nproperties. Colors, tastes etc. really are properties of\nobjects\u2014it is just that they are dispositional and not\ncategorical, as we might at first be tempted to suppose. Similarly,\nactions really are right and wrong, but these are dispositional,\nrather than categorical, properties. Certain features of actions and\nagents are apt to arouse feelings of approval or disapproval in\nus.\n\nIf we adopt the dispositional account, it might seem that Price has\nnow lost any dialectical advantage. In both the perceptual and the\nmoral cases the theory lines up with the phenomenology. \nBroad (1971: 208) plausibly claims, however, that Price would also have rejected the dispositional theory of moral properties.\nOne of Price\u2019s principal objections to the sentimentalist\naccount is that it makes the truth of moral claims contingent on our\nnatures\u2014and our natures might have been very different. On this\nview, what we approve or disapprove of depends on \n\n\na positive constitution of our minds, or \u2026 an\nimplanted and arbitrary principle by which a\nrelish is given us for certain moral objects and forms and\naversion to others. (R 14) \n\n\nThis objection applies as much to the dispositional as to the\nsubjective account. Especially worrying for a theist like Price, there\nis no reason to suppose on the sentimentalist view that God shares our\nmoral sentiments. Indeed, Hume had already drawn this conclusion in a\nletter to Hutcheson (Hume [L], 38\u201340 = Volume I, Letter 16, 16\nMarch 1740).\n\nIndeed Price goes further and claims that, were sentimentalism true,\nGod would have an attitude of complete moral indifference to\neverything that happens. For he knows that all actions and states are\nin themselves neither right nor wrong, neither good nor bad;\nnor, lacking our emotional nature, can he be supposed to make moral\ndiscriminations based on feeling.\n\nThe subjective and the dispositional sentimentalist models are equally\nvulnerable to Price\u2019s implanted sense complaint; on either\naccount the standard of correctness for our moral judgments is set by\nour contingent human nature. Price, by contrast, insists that moral\nprinciples are necessarily and not merely contingently true. What\nmakes them true is solely the intrinsic nature of\nthe actions or character that they characterize. To use a more modern\nparlance, Price is a moral realist, who holds that there are\nstance-independent moral facts.\n2.3 Necessary moral principles\n\nIf there are necessary moral principles, it might seem that they must\nbe exceptionless. If lying is, in virtue of its nature, wrong, then\nall lying is wrong. And the same will hold for any other principles.\nBut such moral rigorism seems deeply implausible. While some (most\nnotably Kant) have bitten the bullet, most of us believe that there\nare circumstances in which it is permissible, or even required, to\nlie. Price agrees. Principles can conflict and none automatically\ntrumps the others. Which principle should govern our actions will\ndepend on the circumstances. In some cases of conflict, it is clear\nwhat morality demands. But in many cases it is not: \u201cdoubt\narises; and we may thus be rendered entirely incapable of determining\nwhat we ought to chuse\u201d (R 167). The lack of clarity here is\nepistemic, not metaphysical: \u201cTruth and right in all\ncircumstances, require one determinate way of acting\u201d (R 167).\nBut since what that way is can be unclear, there can be disagreements\nbetween right-minded people about what to do. None of this, however,\nimpugns our knowledge of the fundamental principles.\n\n\nThe principles themselves, it should be remembered, are self-evident;\nand to conclude the contrary \u2026 because of the obscurity\nattending several cases wherein a competition arises between the\nseveral principles of morality, is very unreasonable. It is not unlike\nconcluding, that, \u2026 because it may not in some instances be\neasy to determine what will be the effect of different forces,\nvariously compounded and acting contrary to each other; therefore we\ncan have no assurance what any of them acting separately will produce,\nor so much as know that there is any such thing as force. (R 168)\n\n\nPrice has, in effect, anticipated Ross\u2019s celebrated distinction\nbetween prima facie duties and duties proper, even down to\nusing the same analogy about conflicting forces to illustrate the\ndistinction.\n2.4 Virtue \n2.4.1 Virtuous motivation\n\nWhat is it to be virtuous? A virtuous act is one that is motivated by\nthe sense of duty\u2014a recognition of what morality requires and\nforbids. What of actions that are motivated by other concerns? While\nPrice denies any moral worth to actions not motivated by a sense of\nduty, he seems to allow that, where motives are mixed, moral credit\nshould be given to the degree to which considerations of duty\nmotivate.\n\n\nBut instinctive benevolence is no principle of virtue, nor\nare any actions flowing merely from it virtuous. \u2026 All actions\n\u2026 appear to have as much less moral value, as they are derived\nmore from natural instinct, and less attended with reflexion on their\nreasonableness and fitness. (R 191)\n\n\nHow is it that humans so often ignore the call of duty? The answer\nlies in the other motivational forces in our nature, such as\nself-love, desires, and the emotions, which can conflict with\ndutifulness. But we are not helpless in the face of these impulses; we\ncan resist at least some of them at will, and we can learn to control\nthem better by developing our character. How our character develops is\nto some extent under our control because personality traits can be\nstrengthened or weakened by practice. Since we are imperfectly\nrational, we should strive to modify our desires and feelings so that\nit is easier for us to do our duty.\n\nBut in what does our duty consist? Price distinguishes between what he\nterms abstract and practical virtue, or what was later (by Prichard\nand Ross) called objective and subjective duty. An agent\u2019s\nobjective duty is what she is morally required to do, given the actual\nfacts of the case; her subjective duty lies in what she should do,\ngiven her reasonable beliefs about the facts of the case. It\nis for succeeding or failing to do one\u2019s subjective duty that\none should be praised or blamed, for an imperfect agent cannot be\nrequired to avoid all errors of fact.\n2.4.2 Supererogation\n\nWhat is it to be perfectly virtuous? Is it sufficient simply\nto perform all our duties, or is there something even better, as many\nhave supposed: meritorious acts of heroism or saintliness that exceed\nwhat is morally required and are singled out for special praise? Price\nmaintains that there are no such supererogatory acts\u2014acts that\ngo beyond the call of duty. Why? Price holds that any action must be\neither right (i.e., required), or wrong, or indifferent.\nSupererogatory actions do not fit this pattern. They are not required\nbut their performance is not morally indifferent. Rejecting the\nsupererogatory leads Price to a counter-intuitive conclusion. \n\n\nTo aim at acting beyond obligation, being the same with\nacting contrary to obligation; and doing more than\nis fit to be done, the same with doing wrong. (R 124)\n\n\nIf we find this doctrine harsh, there are two possible responses. The\nfirst is to add a further category to Price\u2019s tripartite\ndistinction. Price suggests that some may wish to deny that\n\u201cright\u201d and \u201cobligatory\u201d are co-extensive.\n\n\nAll right actions are not so in precisely the same sense; and it might\n\u2026 be granted, that some things are right in such a sense as yet\nnot to be our indispensable duty. (R 120)\n\n\nPrice\u2019s only comment on this approach is that it would undermine\na symmetry between \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d as he\nis using them. It allows cases where an action is right but not\nrequired, but there are still no cases in which an action is wrong but\nnot forbidden. Price does not reject this approach but thinks it\nunnecessarily complicated.\n\nHe prefers to retain his original tripartite structure, but to soften\nany apparent harshness by further explanation. Many of our\nobligations, such as that of being benevolent, are framed only in\ngeneral and vague terms. How and when we fulfill them is, to some\nextent, up to us. Since it is unclear exactly how much is required of\nus by way of kind deeds, a truly virtuous person will err on the side\nof generosity. The praise we bestow on them is not, as the proponent\nof supererogation supposes, because they exceeded the demands of duty,\nbut because they showed such scrupulous care to ensure that they did\nnot fall short of what was required of them. This solution has the\nadvantage of explaining why the heroic or saintly frequently claim\nthat they were, after all, only doing their duty, rather than claiming\nthat they were exceeding it.\n2.4.3 Promising\n\nMost of Price\u2019s claims are defensible, and many have been\nadopted by other prominent thinkers in the Intuitionist tradition. But\nthere is one issue on which he has generally, but not universally,\nbeen held to have gone astray: namely, the source of our obligation to\nkeep our promises. Instead of taking it to be a distinct species of\nduty, Price holds that \u201cfidelity to promises is\nproperly a branch or instance of veracity\u201d (R\n155). We must distinguish, Price claims, between statements about the\npresent and statements about the future. Expressing an intention or a\nresolution to act does not, Price allows, give rise to obligation.\n\n\nFor when I say I intend to do such and such, I affirm only a present\nfact.\u2014But to promise, is to declare that such a thing\nshall be done. \u2026 In this case, it is not enough to\nacquit me from the charge of falsehood, that I intend to do\nwhat I promise, but it must be actually done, agreeably to the\nassurances given. (R 155)\n\n\nPrice allows that I can confidently and reasonably make predictions\nabout events outside my control that subsequently turn out to be\nfalse, without being guilty of lying. But in the case of\nactions that lie within our power\n\n\nthe falsehood must be known and wilful, and entirely imputable to our\nown neglect and guilt. (R 156)\n\n\nThis view has been attacked on a number of counts. First, acts of\nlying are datable; when someone lies they do so at a particular time,\nin a particular place, and to a particular audience. While the\ncontent of a false assertion may concern the future, the lie\noccurs at the time of utterance. If someone fails to do what they said\nshe would, she does not lie at that later time, for at that later time\nshe asserts nothing. Nor does she lie when she says she will do it\nbecause, ex hypothesi, she sincerely believed at that time\nthat she would. If the deed does not follow her words she may be\nguilty of many things: weakness of will, or laziness, cowardice,\npusillanimity, depending on the circumstances. If she has led\nsomeone to rely on her earlier assertion, she may be accused of breach\nof faith, or going back on her word. But what she is not guilty of is\nlying. She would only be guilty of that if she was not\nexpressing a sincere belief when she made the original assertion.\n\nSecond, Price\u2019s view fails to account for the fact that promises\nare made to particular individuals. Suppose Shakira promises\nTom, in the presence of Miguel, that she will pick him up at the\nairport when he returns from his journey. Miguel later discovers that\nhe is flying in to the airport at the same time as Tom and awaits\nShakira\u2019s arrival hoping for a ride. Each has taken Shakira at\nher word and relied on her for transport home. On Price\u2019s\naccount, if Shakira does not show up (without an adequate excuse) then\nshe has lied to both of them, and hence both have the same cause for\ncomplaint. However, Tom has a complaint against Shakira that\nMiguel does not have, for Shakira\u2019s promise was to Tom\nand not to Miguel. It is Tom that she has let down, and not Miguel.\nArguably, Miguel has no complaint against Shakira. He\nreasonably believed that she would show up, but she had offered him no\nassurances. Further, only Tom can let Shakira off her promise, while\nMiguel has no such power.\n\nThere are, indeed, lying promises, but these are ones where\nthe promisor has, at the time he makes it, no intention of carrying it\nout. If my promise is sincere but I fail (without adequate excuse) to\nfulfill it I may be a scoundrel, but not a lying\nscoundrel.\n\nThese are weighty criticisms, but they may be uncharitable to Price.\nThough veracity is, of course, the virtue that concerns truth, Price\nhas a wider conception of what it involves than merely avoiding\nlying.\n\n\nUnder this head, I would comprehend impartiality and honesty of mind\nin our enquiries after truth, as well as a sacred regard to it in all\nwe say; fair and ingenuous dealing; such an openness and simplicity of\ntemper as exclude guile and prevarication, and all the contemptible\narts of craft, equivocation and hypocrisy; fidelity to our\nengagements; sincerity and uprightness in our transactions with\nourselves as well as others; and the careful avoiding of all secret\nattempts to deceive ourselves, and to evade or disguise the truth in\nexamining our own characters. (R 154\u20135)\n\n\nThis is a good description of the virtue of honesty (or\nstraightforwardness, or trustworthiness). And one might reasonably\ndescribe someone who fails to keep their word as dishonest. Moreover,\nguile and deception need not involve lying. Iago does not lie\nwhen he leaves Desdemona\u2019s handkerchief for Othello to find. And\nthere is being \u201ceconomical with the truth\u201d, and casuistry\nof all kinds. Understood thus, there is nothing untoward in Price\ngrouping these desirable qualities together. But\n\u201cveracity\u201d, with its narrow implication of truth-telling,\ndoes not happily cover this wide range of characteristics and Price\noften forgets his official definition and equates honesty with\ntruthfulness.\n\nPart of what Price is doing is to resolve a puzzle raised by Hume in\nthe Treatise.\n\n\n[S]ince the act of the mind, which enters into a promise, and produces\nits obligation, is neither the resolving, desiring, nor willing any\nparticular performance, it must necessarily be the willing of\nthat obligation, which arises from the promise. Nor is this\nonly a conclusion of philosophy; but is entirely conformable to our\ncommon ways of thinking and of expressing ourselves, when we say that\nwe are bound by our own consent, and that the obligation arises from\nour mere will and pleasure. The only question, then, is, whether there\nbe not a manifest absurdity in supposing this act of the mind, and\nsuch an absurdity as no man cou'd fall into, whose ideas are not\nconfounded with prejudice and the fallacious use of language.\n(1739\u201340: 516\u20137; III.ii.5)\n\n\nHume\u2019s puzzle is: how can I, by a mere act of will, create a\nnew obligation? In making a promise, I would thereby declare that\nI am creating an obligation to do something, that was previously\nmorally indifferent. I would somehow make it the case that I am now\nunder an obligation I was not under before. Yet nothing about the act\nI promise to do has changed. How can mere words transform the moral\nlandscape?\n\nPrice agrees with Hume that obligations cannot be created simply by an\nact of will, but denies that this is the correct conception of\npromising. He first tackles this problem when defending his\nanti-voluntarist account of obligation. On his view, which he takes\nfrom Cudworth, each action has a nature in virtue of which it is\nrequired, forbidden, or indifferent.\n\n\nNo will \u2026 can render any thing good and obligatory,\nwhich was not so antecedently, and from eternity. (R 50)\n\n\nIf an act is morally indifferent, then no mere act of will can change\nits moral status. Price considers the objection that the command of\nGod, or a sovereign, may do just that. Price replies:\n\n\nIt is true, the doing of any indifferent thing may become obligatory,\nin consequence of a command from a being possessed of rightful\nauthority over us: But \u2026 in this case, the command produces a\nchange in the circumstances of the agent, and that what, in\nconsequence of it, becomes obligatory, is not the same with what\nbefore was indifferent. (R 51)\n\n\nAs Price puts it, the \u201cmatter of the action\u201d remains the\nsame, but it now falls under a moral law that it did not before. In\nvirtue of changed circumstances, what was previously indifferent can\nbecome an instance of gratitude, or obedience to a lawful command or,\nindeed, an instance of promise-keeping. In this last case we should\nnot suppose\n\n\nthat our own will or breath alters the nature of things by making what\nis indifferent not so. \u2026 All that the promise does, is,\n\u2026 to cause that to be an instance of right conduct [in\nearlier editions, Price writes \u2018of a general and eternal duty]\nwhich was not so before. (R 51)\n\n\nPrice\u2019s answer to Hume is that, though we cannot create\nan obligation by our mere will and pleasure, we can place\nourselves under an obligation by what we do or say, including\nwhen what we say expresses our will. On this central point, Price is\ncorrect. As we have seen, Price holds that the species of obligation\nunder which I place myself in promising is veracity. \nIt may be that the moral category of honesty or trustworthiness would\nbetter capture what Price wants to say, but that is of comparatively\nsecondary importance.\n3. Theology\n\nPrice\u2019s writings on theology and philosophy of religion are\nextensive and complex. After a brief discussion of his views about\nGod\u2019s nature and the arguments for his existence, \nthis section will\nfocus on those aspects of his views that bear on morality, and his\ndiscussion of the credibility of miracles.\n3.1 A priori Arguments for God\u2019s existence\n\nPrice appended to the Review a \u201cDissertation on the\nBeing and Attributes of the Deity\u201d, in which he largely follows\nSamuel Clarke\u2019s a priori arguments to show that there\nmust be a first cause that is perfect in every respect. He begins with\na version of the well-known argument from contingency, which proceeds\nfrom things that exist contingently to something that exists\nnon-contingently, i.e., necessarily. Price accepts the argument but\nholds that previous writers have not properly explained the nature of\nthe necessity of God\u2019s existence. The necessity in question is\nnot what he terms \u201crelative\u201d or\n\u201cconsequential\u201d necessity, as when we say there must be a\ncause of every effect. Rather,\n\n\nthe impossibility of not existing implied in the necessity of\nGod\u2019s existence is \u2026 an impossibility appearing\nimmediately, and carrying its own evidence with it; an\nimpossibility in the nature of the thing itself. (R 287)\n\n\nPrice then goes on, in short order, to deduce several conclusions.\nFirst, that the \u201cnecessity of God\u2019s existence\nimplies that it is necessary \u2026 to the very conception\nof all other existence\u201d (R 288). What can be conceived without a\ndivine ground can be conceived as existing alone. Such beings\n\n\nmight be conceived to exist without him, which is the same as\nconceiving him not to exist, and consequently, with the\npossibility of his non-existence. (R 288)\n\n\nWhat exists necessarily can have no limits or imperfections. For what\nis limited could have had different limits, and so the limited has\nonly contingent existence. Finally, and for our purposes most\nimportantly, a necessary being does not possess its properties, as\nother things do, by participation in those properties as\nsomething distinct from it. Suppose, for example, God were to be\nomnipresent by existing in every part of space, then we could\nconceive of infinite space without him. But if space were\ndistinct from him we would need an explanation of why he existed in\nall of it, rather than in some part, or in none. The same, Price says,\nis true of God\u2019s relation to all his attributes, which he must\npossess\n\n\nin a manner peculiar to himself. He is intelligent, not by the\napprehension of truth, but by being truth. (R\n290)\n\n\nAnd so on, for all his other attributes.\n\n\nThere can be numberless beings who are powerful, wise and benevolent;\nbut there can be but one being of whose nature, power, wisdom\nand benevolence in necessary union and forming one idea, are the\nessential attributes. (R 295)\n\n\nPrice did not publish this piece for some time, and remained\nconcerned that the \u201cparticular imperfection\nof language\u201d rendered him \u201cincapable of stating [his view]\nwith sufficient correctness and clearness\u201d (R 286). \nIt is indeed rather puzzling. His view is clearly influenced by\nthe neo-Platonism which, presumably, he gets from Cudworth.\nNecessary truths depend on the Forms, on their self-identity. The\nForms constitute a purely intelligible realm, and other things are\nintelligible only in so far as they participate in the Forms. Since\nthe Forms are purely intelligible beings their mode of being, the manner in which they exist is by being\nthought. That which thinks the Forms, namely God, is that in which\nthey are. They cannot exist independently, because their very being is\nto be a part of his nature. And it is his own nature governs his\nwill.\n\nBe that as it may, Price\u2019s account of God\u2019s nature enables\nhim to deal with a standard objection to those who reject the Divine\nCommand Theory of morality. If we conceive of morality as a set of\ntruths that are outside God\u2019s control, are we not demeaning\nGod\u2019s sovereignty, by supposing that there is something both\nexternal to him and co-eternal with him? Price\u2019s answer is that\nGod\u2019s rectitude consists, not in obeying some principles that he\ndid not create, cannot change, and must accept, but in following his\nown nature.\n3.2 Natural Theology\n\nLike Cleanthes in Hume\u2019s Dialogues, Price holds that\nbelief in a Designer is immediate and irresistible. \u201cThis\nvisible universe \u2026 is self-evidently, an exhibition of\nthe power and wisdom of a powerful and wise cause\u201d (R 285) But\nwhat of his moral qualities? Although in his introduction to the\n\u201cDissertation\u201d, Price claims that a posteriori\narguments also show the Designer to be good, in Chapter X of the\nReview, Price strikes a cautious note. There may be much more\nof good than bad in the works of that Designer, but we might wonder\nwhether that is sufficient grounds for drawing conclusions about the\nDesigner\u2019s moral character. For a malicious being could produce\nhappiness, and perhaps the Designer grants us happiness now only to\nfrustrate our expectations in order to increase our misery later by\ncontrast to our present state. Price himself thinks that, despite such\npossibilities, we are justified in inferring God\u2019s goodness from\nhis creation but accepts that such inferences are open to cavil.\nHowever, as a moral realist, Price does not need to rely on arguments\nfrom the distribution of good and bad things in the world. For if\nbenevolence is, in itself better than malice, justice than injustice,\nand so on, and if an intelligent mind must both recognize and be\nguided by these thoughts, then we can know a priori that God\nis morally perfect.\n\nNevertheless, it is a striking fact that virtue is not always\nproportionately rewarded, nor vice punished. Price is more realistic\non this point than Butler who said \u201cSelf-love then, though\nconfined to the interest of the present world, does in general\nperfectly coincide with virtue\u201d (1729: Sermon 3, para. 8 [2017:\n36]). Not only do the virtuous often suffer and the vicious flourish,\nbut the virtuous are open to peculiar psychological sufferings of\nwhich the vicious know nothing. They may suffer from an over\nscrupulous conscience, from guilt, and consciousness of their own\nunworthiness.\n\n\nIt can scarcely be denied with respect to wickedness, that it would\nvery frequently be much better for a man, (I mean for his own present\nease) to be thoroughly wicked than partially so. (R\n259)\n\n\nSo much is this the case that Price contends\n\n\nthis world appears fitted more to be a school for the\neducation of virtue, than a station of honour to it. (R\n257)\n\n\nWhat may we infer from these rather dismal facts with respect to a\nfuture life? If we are moral sentimentalists, nothing. But if we\naccept moral realism then we know that a wise Designer will also be a\nmorally good one. From this we may conclude that there is some future\nscene of life in which these imbalances between virtue and reward will\nbe rectified. We cannot, however, infer that this future life will be\nendless, for the injustices of this life could be rectified in a\nfinite time.\n\n\nThat we are to be delivered to from death to a new life that shall\nnever end of complete happiness, this is unspeakably\nmore than any arguments from distributive justice can teach us to\nexpect. (R 263)\n\n\nIt is revelation alone that can assure us of God\u2019s graciousness\nin this respect.\n3.3 Miracles\n\nPrice\u2019s illuminating discussion of Hume\u2019s notorious attack\non the credibility of miracles is informed both by his interest in\nprobability theory, and by his good sense. Hume\u2019s argument, in a\nnutshell, is that there can never be sufficient reason to believe in a\nviolation of a law of nature because we know, a priori, that\nany evidence from testimony for the occurrence of a miracle will be\noutweighed by our evidence from long experience that such things do\nnot happen. Our confidence in the reliability of testimony and our\nconfidence in some generalization being a law of nature have the same\nsource: experience. But whereas we have often found testimony to be\nfalse, the experiences on which our belief in a law of nature is\nfounded are exceptionless. If there were exceptions, we would conclude\nthat we were not dealing with a law of nature. So we always have more\nevidence that a miracle did not occur than that it did. Hume presents\nus with a characteristic fork. If what is reported would violate a law\nof nature, then we should not give credence to the report. If what is\nreported is merely uncommon, then we might have sufficient evidence to\nbelieve it, but the event would not be miraculous.\n\nPrice disputes four claims, on which he thinks Hume\u2019s argument\nrests.\nThe most important are the first three.\n\n \u201cThat the credit we give to testimony, is derived\nsolely from experience\u201d\n \u201cThat a miracle is a fact contrary to\nexperience\u201d\n \u201cThat the previous improbability of a fact is a proof\nagainst it, diminishing, in proportion to the degree of it, the proof\nfrom testimony for it\u201d (D 389).\n\n\nPrice\u2019s rebuttals are as follows.\n\nOur confidence in the reliability of testimony rests, and should\nrest, not only on the frequency with which testimony has been\nconfirmed balanced against the frequency with which it has been\ndisconfirmed, but also on our knowledge of the character(s) of those\nbearing witness, and of people in general.\n\n\nOne action, or one conversation with a man, may convince us of his\nintegrity and induce us to believe his testimony, though we have\nnever, in a single instance, experienced his veracity. (D 399)\n\n\u201cA miracle is more properly an event different from\nexperience than contrary to it\u201d (D 402). Testimony to\nan unusual event, while it provides evidence for the occurrence of\nthat event, does not contradict our experience of what\nhappened before, or even conflict with it. We would continue to be as\njustified as we were previously in believing that this kind of event\nhad not happened before. Prior uniform observation is not\nexperiential evidence against the occurrence of the unusual.\n\u201c[I]t can be no part of any one\u2019s experience, that the\ncourse of nature will continue always the same\u201d (D 402). Were\nthis not so, we could never have reason to believe that something we\npreviously took to be a law of nature was not in fact one.\n Price argues that it is very common for \u201cthe slightest\ntestimony to overcome an almost infinite improbability\u201d (D 406).\nThe prior probability of many common facts is extremely low, yet the\nevidence of testimony is sufficient to confirm them. Take an example\nwhere the prior probability can be calculated: the odds against any\nparticular distribution of cards in a game of Bridge are enormous. Yet\nthe testimony of the players as to what was in each hand is quite\nsufficient to establish that as a fact. What is more, Price argues,\nvariations in the prior improbability of the event are irrelevant when\nit comes to the weight of testimony. \u201cThe only causes of\nfalsehood in testimony are the intention to deceive, and the danger of\nbeing deceived\u201d (D 415). But the degree of prior improbability\ndoes not increase or diminish either of these.\n\n\nImprobabilities \u2026 as such, do not affect the\ncapacity of testimony to report truth. They \u2026 should\nnot be considered as a counter-evidence invalidating, in\nproportion to their degree, its reports.\u2014But tho\u2019 this is\ntrue, it by no means follows, that they may not in many circumstances\naffect the credit of testimony, or cause us to question its\nveracity. (D 417)\n \n\n\nAs Hume pointed out, mankind are lovers of the marvelous, and\nraconteurs delight in feeding that credulity. If someone reports a\ntruly astonishing event, especially if it redounds to the\nnarrator\u2019s credit, or supports some ideology she is keen to\npromote, that may lead us \u201cto question the faithfulness of a\nreport, and give just ground to suspect a design to misrepresent or\nexaggerate\u201d (D 420). Price points out, however, that this only\napplies when the reporter is aware of the marvelous nature of their\ntale. Mere coincidence does not diminish the evidential\nweight of testimony.\n\n\n[W]ere a person to tell us that \u2026 at the time of drawing a\nlottery, he happened to hear his age, the day of the month, and the\ndate of the year drawn together, we should scarcely believe him,\ntho\u2019 we know that he was not more unlikely to hear these numbers\ndrawn, than any other particular numbers. But if the same person was\nonly to tell us the numbers themselves, and the coincidence which\nstrikes us was entirely our own discovery, we should have just the\nsame reason for believing his account, as if there had been no such\ncoincidence. (D 422\u20133)\n\n\nThe upshot is that, in Price\u2019s view, the debate should neither\nfocus on the abstract possibility of evidence for miracles, nor on\ntheir prior improbability, but, rather, on the particular question of\nwhether the Apostles were either deceived or were themselves\ndeceivers. Price, needless to say, is confident of victory on this\nground, though others may demur.\n4. Liberty\n\nPrice distinguishes four different sorts of liberty all of which, he\nclaims, have a common theme.\n\n\n Physical liberty is \u201cthat principle of\nspontaneity, or self-determination, which constitutes us agents, or\nwhich gives us a command over our actions, rendering them properly\nours, and not effects of the operation of any foreign cause\u201d (P\n21\u20132).\n Moral liberty \u201cis the power of following, in all\ncircumstances, our sense of right and wrong, or of acting in\nconformity to our reflecting and moral principles, without being\ncontrouled by any contrary principles\u201d (P 22)\n Religious liberty \u201cis the power of exercising,\nwithout molestation, that mode of religion which we think best\u201d\n(P 22)\n Civil liberty \u201cis the power of a civil society\n\u2026 to govern itself by its own discretion, or by laws of its own\nmaking\u201d (P 22).\n\n\n\nThe first two concern the issue of free will and moral responsibility;\nthe second two concern issues of political governance. Nevertheless,\nPrice contends, they are all forms of liberty because \u201cthere is\none general idea that runs through them all; \u2026 the idea of\nself-direction or self-government\u201d (P 22)\n4.1 Free will, rationality, and moral agency\n\nPrice distinguishes, in a way that anticipates Kant, two ways in which\nmy action may be free: the first, physical liberty, is freedom to\nchoose; the second is moral autonomy. Freedom of choice is required\nfor agency and hence for moral responsibility. But that freedom allows\nus to act wrongly as well as rightly, to be irrational as well as\nrational, to go astray as well as to go aright. When we go astray,\nPrice contends, by doing something we know we shouldn\u2019t, we feel\nourselves unfree, in that we have lost control. We lack self-mastery\nor moral autonomy: we have succumbed to temptation, instead of obeying\nthe moral law. As with Kant, moral autonomy is the triumph of both\nrationality and morality over countervailing desires, since we always\nhave most reason to fulfill our moral obligations. Price contends\nalso, in good Platonic fashion, that when we follow virtue we do what\nwe (really) want. It is fairly common to distinguish those parts of\none\u2019s personality with which one identifies, and that are taken\nto be its central core, and those impulses that are seen as external,\nalien, or even threatening. The metaphor of addiction or enslavement\nis virtually irresistible in explaining this distinction: we are under\nattack by passions which can take control of us if we are not careful,\nso that we no longer do what we want to do, but what these\nalien forces or siren voices tempt us to do. If we give in too often\nwe will have lost the battle and our autonomy; we will no longer be in\ncharge of our own lives, but succumb to what we reject, and even hate.\nSome philosophers hold that the agent has considerable choice in\ndetermining which parts of her personality are central and which\nperipheral. Price claims, however, that the central core of our\nidentity is metaphysically fixed.\n\n\n[What] is most properly a man\u2019s self \u2026 is\n\u2026 not his passions, but his reason or his judgment, prescribing\nwhat is right, and prohibiting what is wrong. The conscience of a man\nis the man; the reflecting principle is our supreme principle. It is\nwhat gives our distinction as intelligent creatures; and whenever we\nact contrary to it, we violate our natures, and are at variance with\nourselves. (Price 1816: 208, quoted in D.\nO. Thomas 1977: 170)\n\n\nIn short, physical liberty is a necessary condition of the capacity to\ndirect one\u2019s actions at all; moral liberty is exercising that\nagency to direct one\u2019s actions as normative reality\nrequires.\n4.2 Determinism and agent-causation\n\nThere is much to suggest that Price is a libertarian who denies\npsychological determinism and embraces agent-causation instead. It is\nwe, and not our psychological states, that determine our\nactions. The self stands above the fray, as it were, and decides which\nreasons or motives we will act on. The following passages are\ntypical.\n\n\nDetermination requires an efficient cause. If that cause is the being\nhimself, I plead for no more. If not, then it is no longer\nhis determination; that is, he is no longer the\ndeterminer, but the motive, or whatever else any one will say to be\nthe cause of the determination. To ask, what effects our\ndetermination, is the very same with asking who did an action, after\nbeing informed that such a one did it. (R 181\u20132)\n\n[It is] very plain, that motives can have no concern in\neffecting [the agent\u2019s] determination \u2026 What\nwould be more absurd than to say, that our inclinations act upon us,\nor compel us; that our desires and fears put us into motion,\nor produce our volitions; that is, are agents? (R\n183n)\n\n\nD. O. Thomas (1977: 160\u20132) points out, however, that there are\npassages in Price in which he appears to embrace psychological\ndeterminism, of which this is one of the most striking.\n\n\nWere we thoroughly acquainted with the heart of a man, the turn of his\ntemper, and the make of his mind, we should never want experience to\ninform us, what he will do, or how far he is to be trusted (R 28).\n\n\nSolving these difficulties is beyond the scope of this entry, but we\nmight note that while causal determinism (whether physical or\npsychological) entails that, in principle, all events are completely\npredictable, including human actions, the entailment does not run the\nother way. What is predictable need not be causally determined.\nConsider God, the morally perfect agent. He will always act according\nto the dictates of reason, and thus has moral freedom to the highest\ndegree. This need not preclude his having freedom of choice, however.\nPrice\u2019s view is that he has the power, the physical\nliberty, to do or abstain, but his character is such that he\nwill not do the wrong thing. (R 206)\n\nWhat of finite agents? In the passage from which the quotation comes,\nPrice is contrasting our belief that phenomena are regularly connected\nwith each other with a real understanding of why this is so.\n\n\nThe whole meaning of accounting for a fact, implies something in the\nnature of objects that includes a connexion between them, or a fitness\nin certain ways to influence one another. \u2026While we only see\none thing constantly attending or following another, without\nperceiving the real dependence and connexion \u2026 we are\nnecessarily dissatisfied. (R 27)\n\n\nGiven this context, Price may be claiming simply that, were we to\nunderstand the light in which an agent saw all the considerations\nrelevant to acting, we would know how he would choose. That may be\ncompatible with the agent\u2019s character being self-formed by his\nchoices.\n\nHere are two difficulties for Price\u2019s claim that understanding\nthe light in which someone saw their action would enable us to predict\nwhat they would do. First, it is questionable whether weak-willed\nactions are fully intelligible. Although the agent has reasons for\nwhat he does, they do not explain his making the worse rather than the\nbetter choice. Second, if we are genuinely able to form and change our\ncharacters through our choices, then there must be occasions on which\nwe act out of character. If there is real freedom of choice even God\nmight not know with complete certainty what we will do (though this view, known as Open Theism, might be unpalatable to\nPrice).\n4.3 Political Liberty\n\nPrice\u2019s writings on religious and civil liberty are voluminous.\nMany are largely of historical interest, as they deal with issues of\nthe day, rather than broad principles.  The main claims of his social\nand political philosophy are briefly summarised in what follows.\n4.3.1 Religious Liberty\n\nPrice\u2019s reasons for advocating complete freedom of religion are\nnumerous, but familiar. All religious tests for public office\nencourage persecution of the nonconformists as well as hypocrisy, by\ngiving incentives for outward subscription to something not believed.\nThey interfere with conscience, which is a private matter between an\nindividual and his deity. Above all, they hinder the great\nEnlightenment project of the onward march of reason and the\ndestruction of all forms of superstition. Toleration is insufficient,\nfor that implies that society recognizes one creed but tolerates\nothers. Full freedom should be extended to all religions, not just\ndifferent Christian denominations.\n4.3.2 Civil Liberty\n\nPrice\u2019s political philosophy is, broadly speaking, in line with\nLocke\u2019s, but he follows it through to more radical conclusions.\nThe legitimacy of a government (though not of other hierarchical\ndistinctions) stems from the consent of the governed. Whereas in Locke\nthe people have a right to rebel only if there is a breach of the\nsocial contract, for Price they retain the right to alter their form\nof government as they wish. Direct democracy is the most desirable\nform of government, but in larger states democracy has perforce to be\nrepresentative. However, those elected are to be more delegates than\nrepresentatives, subject to instructions from their constituents (P\n25).\n\nIt is not clear how far Price thinks the franchise should be extended.\nThe logic of his position would seem to suggest universal suffrage,\nbut Price is no real advocate for it. He shares a common concern about\nthe qualifications of the uneducated and dependent to be voters.\nWriting of the election of British Members of Parliament before the\nGreat Reform Act of 1832, Price complains not only of the small size\nof the electorate, but also that voters are often drawn from the\n\u201cmeanest persons\u201d, the \u201clowest of the people\u201d.\nOne worry was that, insofar as they were dependent on landowners or\nemployers, their vote would not be genuinely independent.\nPrice appears never to have suggested extending the suffrage to women,\nperhaps because he thought them too ill educated and too dependent on\ntheir husbands or other male relatives. Price, unlike his friend\nWollstonecraft, appears never to have questioned the status quo in\nthis respect.\n\nCivil liberty, for Price, concerns the autonomy of a community or\nstate to make its own laws, free from outside interference. Important\nas this is, especially in the context of the American Revolution, it\nraises the question of what constitutes a distinct community or\nsociety. Does any dissident group constitute a community with the\nright to secede? This is an issue that has occasioned much violence\nand bloodshed, including the secession of the Southern States in 1860\nand, in our own day, Scottish, Basque, and Irish independence. The\nomission of a discussion of this seriously weakens his political\nphilosophy.\n\nOddly, Price does not include the liberty of the citizen as well as\nthe liberty of a country in his original definition of civil liberty.\nA country that governs itself can still be internally deeply\nrepressive. Price became aware of this deficiency, and expanded his\naccount in Additional Observations (P 76-100).\n\n\nA citizen is free when the power of commanding his own conduct and the\nquiet possession of his life, person, property and good name are\nsecured to him by being his own legislator \u2026 a government is\nfree when constituted in such a manner as to give this security. And\nthe freedom of a community or nation is the same among nations that\nthe freedom of a citizen is among his fellow-citizens. (P 82)\n\n\nThe best ways to secure a free government are the following:\n\n all parts of the state should be represented in the governing\nlegislature\n the representatives must be freely chosen by the electorate\n the representatives must be independent of any outside source of\npower\n they should be subject to frequent re-election\n they should be accountable to their constituents in all their\nacts\n\n\nThese proposals may now appear fairly modest, but few societies match\nup to them. For example, the power of corporate owners and lobbyists\nin funding elections in the United States breaches clause 3. The\nexistence of dependent territories, such as Puerto Rico, breaches\nclause 1. The existence of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom\nbreaches clauses 2 and 4. Revolutionary for the time, Price\u2019s\nsuggestions remain radical even today.\n5. Influence\n\nAlthough Price was influential in his lifetime in many areas, that\ninfluence soon waned, and few of his works were reprinted after his\ndeath. His immediate impact on discussion of the events surrounding\nthe American and French revolutions was large, but naturally faded as\nthose upheavals slipped into history. He died before the excesses of\nthe French revolution, which had been predicted by Burke. As a result\nof the success of his predictions, Burke acquired an immense\nreputation, while Price\u2019s was eclipsed. There is no doubt that\nPrice, along with others in the \u201cAge of Reason\u201d,\nexaggerated the degree to which people would pay attention to rational\nprinciples and reasonable solutions. There seems little to suggest\nthat his writings had a long-term impact on political philosophy.\nNevertheless, liberal-democratic societies have embraced many of\nPrice\u2019s causes; in that sense, in the longer term, Price could\nbe seen as being on the side of history after all.\n\nHis influence on the Unitarian movement also faded. His version of\nArianism, in which Christ was seen as having most of the supernatural\nattributes of the second person of the Trinity without actually being\nGod, gave way to the Socinian view, championed by Priestley, which\nstressed the straightforward humanity of Jesus. His reputation in\nactuarial work and demography suffered from his mistaken claim that\nthe British population was in decline. Even his beloved project of\nreducing or eliminating the national debt by means of a sinking fund\nfell out of favor.\n\nHis main legacy is, of course, in moral philosophy, but even here it\nis unclear how much direct influence he had. Some of the themes in\nA Review, especially issues to do with moral motivation and\nresponsibility, find distinct echoes in Kant, but that comes from\nsympathy of outlook, rather than influence. And Price\u2019s\nepistemology and metaphysics are wholly different from Kant\u2019s,\ndespite Hastings Rashdall\u2019s exaggerated claim that the\nReview \u201ccontains the gist of the Kantian doctrine\nwithout Kant\u2019s confusion\u201d (1907: 81 fn 1). The main\nfeatures of Price\u2019s epistemology, and his pluralism about moral\nprinciples, emerge again with the British Intuitionists who flourished\nin the first half of the twentieth century. While we know that C. D.\nBroad and Hastings Rashdall both rated Price very highly, \nthere is\nno direct evidence that Prichard, or even Ross (whose views most closely\nresemble Price\u2019s) had read him, though it seems likely they\ndid.\n\nInterest in Price was to some degree revived by books by Roland Thomas\n(1924), Carl Cone (1952), Lennart \u00c5qvist (1960), D. O. Thomas\n(1977), and W. D. Hudson (1970). Since then there has been a steady\ntrickle of articles on aspects of Price\u2019s work, but no real\ngroundswell of interest, despite another revival in the fortunes of\nIntuitionism towards the end of the twentieth century. In 1977 the\nPrice-Priestley Newsletter was founded; it morphed later into\nEnlightenment and Dissent, which ceased publication in 2016.\nHowever, resources for the study of Price have been greatly enhanced\nby the untiring work of D. O. Thomas who not only edited Price\u2019s\npolitical writings but, together with Bernard Peach, produced a\ncomplete edition of Price\u2019s correspondence.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<h4 id=\"WorkRichPric\">Works by Richard Price</h4>\n<p>\nThere is currently no up to date complete edition of Price\u2019s\nworks.

It devotes considerable space to Price's\ninfluence on actuarial practice and on the politics of his day. Cone\n(1952) has a similar structure, but is more detailed than Thomas\n1924. Written from an American perspective it casts light on Price's\ninfluence in the framing of the Constitution of the USA. Thomas 1976\nis a very brief but engaging study. Frame's (2015) magisterial volume\nis the first to take a purely chronological approach to its subject\nseeking to place Price and his work firmly in their historical\ncontext.

Although it contains some inaccuracies, it\nis by far the most detailed contemporary source. A modern edition,\nedited and with an introduction by D. O. Thomas, constitutes the\ncomplete contents of the journal Enlightenment and Dissent 22\n(2003). R. Thomas (1924) interweaves biography with discussion of his\nideas and influence. It devotes considerable space to Price's\ninfluence on actuarial practice and on the politics of his day. Cone\n(1952) has a similar structure, but is more detailed than Thomas\n1924. Written from an American perspective it casts light on Price's\ninfluence in the framing of the Constitution of the USA.  Thomas 1976\nis a very brief but engaging study. Frame's (2015) magisterial volume\nis the first to take a purely chronological approach to its subject\nseeking to place Price and his work firmly in their historical\ncontext. It makes full use of Price's correspondence and his shorthand\njournal to give the fullest picture to date.</p>\n</div>"}, "related_entries": {"entry_list": ["Butler, Joseph: moral philosophy",
