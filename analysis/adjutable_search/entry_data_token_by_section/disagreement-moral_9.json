    "main_text": "Epistemological Arguments from Moral Disagreement || Disagreement and Safety\n4.2 Disagreement and Safety\n\n\nIs there a plausible way to accommodate the fact that there is\nnear-universal agreement about some moral claims while still\nmaintaining that moral disagreement supports global moral skepticism?\nOne option is to argue that the disagreement can play a more indirect\nrole (see, e.g., Enoch 2009). The idea could be that it is not the\ndisagreement itself which makes our moral beliefs unjustified, but\nrather some underlying factor which the disagreement is a symptom of\n(and which might obtain also when the symptom is absent). One may\nimagine, for example, that even if just some moral claims attract\ndisagreement, the best explanation of the diversity of moral views is\nnevertheless a theory about the causal background of moral beliefs\nwhich holds generally. If that theory in turn suggests that the beliefs\nare caused in a way that undermines their justification, it allows us\nto see how the disagreement can support global moral skepticism, even\ngranted that some moral claims do not generate controversy. In this\ntype of argument, the relevance of the disagreement is somewhat reduced\n(though not entirely obliterated) compared to that assigned to it by\nconciliationism, as disagreement merely plays the role of being\nevidence that the more fundamental skepticism-generating condition\nobtains.\n\n\nAccording to one suggestion along those lines, what moral\ndisagreements reveal is that the abilities or methods we use to form\nour moral beliefs are not sufficiently reliable or truth-tracking. They\nmay fail to be so, for example, by being such that, even if the beliefs\nwe have formed by using those methods are in fact true, we could easily\nhave ended up with false ones. If we could not easily have been\nmistaken (by using the same methods that we used to form our actual\nbeliefs), then our beliefs are sometimes said to be \u201csafe\u201d.\nSome theorists take safety to be a necessary condition of knowledge\n(see, e.g., Pritchard 2005 and Williamson 2000). If it could be shown\nthat existing moral disagreements indicate that our moral beliefs are\nnot safe, then this offers a way forward for moral skeptics (for this\nidea, see e.g., Mogensen 2016; Hirvela 2017; Risberg and Tersman 2019;\nand Clarke-Doane 2020, 148).\n\n\nHow is moral disagreement supposed to show that our moral beliefs\nare unsafe? Consider a person a whose beliefs about a set of\ncontested moral topics are true. The beliefs are safe only if\na, by using the same methods, could not easily have formed\nbeliefs that contradict her actual ones in circumstances where the\nmoral facts remain the same. Now, what disagreement about\na\u2019s beliefs entails is that some people have in\nfact formed beliefs that contradict a\u2019s actual ones\nin circumstances where (we are supposing) the moral facts remain the\nsame. So, if (some of) those persons have used the same methods as\na and if the existence of those persons accordingly indicates\nthat a could easily have formed those beliefs as well by using\nthose methods (on the ground, perhaps, that they have grown up in\nsimilar social or cultural circumstances and have been exposed to\nsimilar types of education), then it also indicates that\na\u2019s beliefs are unsafe.\n\n\nThis is just a sketch of an argument, of course, and it faces\nserious challenges. One is to clarify the notion of a\n\u201cmethod\u201d, which is required in order to make sense of the\nclaim that different people use the same methods to arrive at\nincompatible moral beliefs. Another problem is to explain in more\nprecise terms what it means to say that it could \u201ceasily\u201d\nhave happened that someone had formed an opposing belief. It is a\ntricky task to provide precise definitions of those notions which both\nrender the view that safety is required for knowledge plausible and\nvindicate the role assigned to disagreement by the indicated\nargument.\n",
