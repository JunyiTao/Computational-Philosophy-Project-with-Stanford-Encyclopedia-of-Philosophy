    "main_text": "Cognitive Science\n5. Cognitive Science\n\nAs we have seen, most theories of word meaning in linguistics face, at\nsome point, the difficulties involved in drawing a plausible dividing\nline between word knowledge and world knowledge, and the various ways\nthey attempt to meet this challenge display some recurrent features.\nFor example, they assume that the lexicon, though richly interfaced\nwith world knowledge and non-linguistic cognition, remains an\nautonomous representational system encoding a specialized body of\nlinguistic knowledge. In this section, we survey a group of empirical\napproaches that adopt a different stance on word meaning. The focus is\nonce again psychological, which means that the overall goal of these\napproaches is to provide a cognitively realistic account of the\nrepresentational repertoire underlying knowledge of word meaning.\nUnlike the approaches surveyed in\n Section 4,\n however, these theories tend to encourage a view on which the\ndistinction between the semantic and pragmatic aspects of word meaning\nis highly unstable (or even impossible to draw), where lexical\nknowledge and knowledge of worldly facts are aspects of a continuum,\nand where the lexicon is permeated by our general inferential\nabilities (Evans 2010).\n Section 5.1\n will briefly illustrate the central assumptions underlying the study\nof word meaning in cognitive linguistics.\n Section 5.2\n will turn to the study of word meaning in psycholinguistics.\n Section 5.3\n will conclude with some references to neurolinguistics.\n",
