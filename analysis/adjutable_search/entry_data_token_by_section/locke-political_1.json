    "main_text": "State of Nature\n2. State of Nature\n\nLocke\u2019s concept of the state of nature has been interpreted by\ncommentators in a variety of ways. At first glance it seems quite\nsimple. Locke writes \u201cwant [lack] of a common judge, with\nauthority, puts all men in a state of nature\u201d and again,\n\u201cMen living together according to reason, without a common\nsuperior on earth, with authority to judge between them, is properly\nthe state of nature.\u201d (Two Treatises 2.19) Many\ncommentators have taken this as Locke\u2019s definition, concluding\nthat the state of nature exists wherever there is no legitimate\npolitical authority able to judge disputes and where people live\naccording to the law of reason. On this account the state of nature is\ndistinct from political society, where a legitimate government exists,\nand from a state of war where men fail to abide by the law of\nreason.\n\nSimmons (1993) presents an important challenge to this view. Simmons\npoints out that the above statement is worded as a sufficient rather\nthan necessary condition. Two individuals might be able, in the state\nof nature, to authorize a third to settle disputes between them\nwithout leaving the state of nature, since the third party would not\nhave, for example, the power to legislate for the public good. Simmons\nalso claims that other interpretations often fail to account for the\nfact that there are some people who live in states with legitimate\ngovernments who are nonetheless in the state of nature: visiting\naliens (Two Treatises 2.9), children below the age of\nmajority (2.15, 118), and those with a \u201cdefect\u201d of reason\n(2.60). He claims that the state of nature is a relational concept\ndescribing a particular set of moral relations that exist between\nparticular people, rather than a description of a particular\ngeographical territory where there is no government with effective\ncontrol. The state of nature is just the way of describing the moral\nrights and responsibilities that exist between people who have not\nconsented to the adjudication of their disputes by the same legitimate\ngovernment. The groups just mentioned either have not or cannot give\nconsent, so they remain in the state of nature. Thus A may be in the\nstate of nature with respect to B, but not with C.\n\nSimmons\u2019 account stands in sharp contrast to that of Strauss\n(1953). According to Strauss, Locke presents the state of nature as a\nfactual description of what the earliest society is like, an account\nthat when read closely reveals Locke\u2019s departure from Christian\nteachings. State of nature theories, he and his followers argue, are\ncontrary to the Biblical account in Genesis and evidence that\nLocke\u2019s teaching is similar to that of Hobbes. As noted above,\non the Straussian account Locke\u2019s apparently Christian\nstatements are only a fa\u00e7ade designed to conceal his\nessentially anti-Christian views. According to Simmons, since the\nstate of nature is a moral account, it is compatible with a wide\nvariety of social accounts without contradiction. If we know only that\na group of people are in a state of nature, we know only the rights\nand responsibilities they have toward one another; we know nothing\nabout whether they are rich or poor, peaceful or warlike.\n\nA complementary interpretation is made by John Dunn (1969) with\nrespect to the relationship between Locke\u2019s state of nature and\nhis Christian beliefs. Dunn claimed that Locke\u2019s state of nature\nis less an exercise in historical anthropology than a theological\nreflection on the condition of man. On Dunn\u2019s interpretation,\nLocke\u2019s state of nature thinking is an expression of his\ntheological position, that man exists in a world created by God for\nGod\u2019s purposes but that governments are created by men in order\nto further those purposes.\n\nLocke\u2019s theory of the state of nature will thus be tied closely\nto his theory of natural law, since the latter defines the rights of\npersons and their status as free and equal persons. The stronger the\ngrounds for accepting Locke\u2019s characterization of people as\nfree, equal, and independent, the more helpful the state of nature\nbecomes as a device for representing people. Still, it is important to\nremember that none of these interpretations claims that Locke\u2019s\nstate of nature is only a thought experiment, in the way Kant\nand Rawls are normally thought to use the concept. Locke did not\nrespond to the argument \u201cwhere have there ever been people in\nsuch a state\u201d by saying it did not matter since it was only a\nthought experiment. Instead, he argued that there are and have been\npeople in the state of nature (Two Treatises 2.14). It seems\nimportant to him that at least some governments have actually been\nformed in the way he suggests. How much it matters whether they have\nbeen or not will be discussed below under the topic of consent, since\nthe central question is whether a good government can be legitimate\neven if it does not have the actual consent of the people who live\nunder it; hypothetical contract and actual contract theories will tend\nto answer this question differently.\n",
