    "main_text": "Set theory as the foundation of mathematics || Metamathematics\n5.1 Metamathematics\n\nThe remarkable fact that virtually all of mathematics can be\nformalized within ZFC, makes possible a mathematical study of\nmathematics itself. Thus, any questions about the existence of some\nmathematical object, or the provability of a conjecture or hypothesis\ncan be given a mathematically precise formulation. This makes\nmetamathematics possible, namely the mathematical study of\nmathematics itself. So, the question about the provability or\nunprovability of any given mathematical statement becomes a sensible\nmathematical question. When faced with an open mathematical problem or\nconjecture, it makes sense to ask for its provability or unprovability\nin the ZFC formal system. Unfortunately, the answer may be neither,\nbecause ZFC, if consistent, is incomplete.\n",
