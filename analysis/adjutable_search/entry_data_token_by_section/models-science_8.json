    "main_text": "Epistemology: The Cognitive Functions of Models || Learning about target systems\n3.2 Learning about target systems\n\nOnce we have knowledge about the model, this knowledge has to be\n\u201ctranslated\u201d into knowledge about the target system. It is\nat this point that the representational function of models becomes\nimportant again: if a model represents, then it can instruct us about\nreality because (at least some of) the model\u2019s parts or aspects\nhave corresponding parts or aspects in the world. But if learning is\nconnected to representation and if there are different kinds of\nrepresentations (analogies, idealizations, etc.), then there are also\ndifferent kinds of learning. If, for instance, we have a model we take\nto be a realistic depiction, the transfer of knowledge from the model\nto the target is accomplished in a different manner than when we deal\nwith an analogue, or a model that involves idealizing assumptions. For\na discussion of the different ways in which the representational\nfunction of models can be exploited to learn about the target, we\nrefer the reader to the entry\n Scientific Representation.\n",
