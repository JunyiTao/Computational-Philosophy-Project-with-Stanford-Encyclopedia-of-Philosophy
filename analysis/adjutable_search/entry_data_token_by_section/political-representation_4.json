    "main_text": "Contemporary Advances\n3. Contemporary Advances\n\nThere have been a number of important advances in theorizing the\nconcept of political representation. In particular, these advances\ncall into question the traditional way of thinking of political\nrepresentation as a principal-agent relationship. Most notably,\nMelissa Williams\u2019 recent work has recommended reenvisioning the\nactivity of representation in light of the experiences of historically\ndisadvantaged groups. In particular, she recommends understanding\nrepresentation as \u201cmediation.\u201d In particular, Williams\n(1998, 8) identifies three different dimensions of political life that\nrepresentatives must \u201cmediate:\u201d the dynamics of\nlegislative decision-making, the nature of legislator-constituent\nrelations, and the basis for aggregating citizens into representable\nconstituencies. She explains each aspect by using a corresponding\ntheme (voice, trust, and memory) and by drawing on the experiences of\nmarginalized groups in the United States. For example, drawing on the\nexperiences of American women trying to gain equal citizenship,\nWilliams argues that historically disadvantaged groups need a\n\u201cvoice\u201d in legislative decision-making. The \u201cheavily\ndeliberative\u201d quality of legislative institutions requires the\npresence of individuals who have direct access to historically\nexcluded perspectives.\n\nIn addition, Williams explains how representatives need to mediate the\nrepresentative-constituent relationship in order to build\n\u201ctrust.\u201d For Williams, trust is the cornerstone for\ndemocratic accountability. Relying on the experiences of\nAfrican-Americans, Williams shows the consistent patterns of betrayal\nof African-Americans by privileged white citizens that give them good\nreason for distrusting white representatives and the institutions\nthemselves. For Williams, relationships of distrust can be \u201cat\nleast partially mended if the disadvantaged group is represented by\nits own members\u201d(1998, 14). Finally, representation involves\nmediating how groups are defined. The boundaries of groups according\nto Williams are partially established by past experiences \u2014 what\nWilliams calls \u201cmemory.\u201d Having certain shared patterns of\nmarginalization justifies certain institutional mechanisms to\nguarantee presence.\n\nWilliams offers her understanding of representation as mediation as a\nsupplement to what she regards as the traditional conception of\nliberal representation. Williams identifies two strands in liberal\nrepresentation. The first strand she describes as the \u201cideal of\nfair representation as an outcome of free and open elections in which\nevery citizen has an equally weighted vote\u201d (1998, 57). The\nsecond strand is interest-group pluralism, which Williams describes as\nthe \u201ctheory of the organization of shared social interests with\nthe purpose of securing the equitable representation \u2026 of those\ngroups in public policies\u201d (ibid.). Together, the two\nstrands provide a coherent approach for achieving fair representation,\nbut the traditional conception of liberal representation as made up of\nsimply these two strands is inadequate. In particular, Williams\ncriticizes the traditional conception of liberal representation for\nfailing to take into account the injustices experienced by\nmarginalized groups in the United States. Thus, Williams expands\naccounts of political representation beyond the question of\ninstitutional design and thus, in effect, challenges those who\nunderstand representation as simply a matter of formal procedures of\nauthorization and accountability.\n\nAnother way of reenvisioning representation was offered by Nadia\nUrbinati (2000, 2002). Urbinati argues for understanding\nrepresentation as advocacy. For Urbinati, the point\nof representation should not be the aggregation of interests, but the\npreservation of disagreements necessary for preserving liberty.\nUrbinati identifies two main features of advocacy: 1) the\nrepresentative\u2019s passionate link to the electors\u2019 cause\nand 2) the representative\u2019s relative autonomy of judgment.\nUrbinati emphasizes the importance of the former for motivating\nrepresentatives to deliberate with each other and their constituents.\nFor Urbinati the benefit of conceptualizing representation as advocacy\nis that it improves our understanding of deliberative democracy. In\nparticular, it avoids a common mistake made by many contemporary\ndeliberative democrats: focusing on the formal procedures of\ndeliberation at the expense of examining the sources of inequality\nwithin civil society, e.g. the family. One benefit of Urbinati\u2019s\nunderstanding of representation is its emphasis on the importance of\nopinion and consent formation. In particular, her agonistic conception\nof representation highlights the importance of disagreements and\nrhetoric to the procedures, practices, and ethos of democracy. Her\naccount expands the scope of theoretical discussions of representation\naway from formal procedures of authorization to the deliberative and\nexpressive dimensions of representative institutions. In this way, her\nagonistic understanding of representation provides a theoretical tool\nto those who wish to explain how non-state actors\n\u201crepresent.\u201d\n\nOther conceptual advancements have helped clarify the meaning of\nparticular aspects of representation. For instance, Andrew Rehfeld\n(2009) has argued that we need to disaggregate the delegate/trustee\ndistinction. Rehfeld highlights how representatives can be delegates\nand trustees in at least three different ways. For this reason, we\nshould replace the traditional delegate/trustee distinction with three\ndistinctions (aims, source of judgment, and responsiveness). By\ncollapsing these three different ways of being delegates and trustees,\npolitical theorists and political scientists overlook the ways in\nwhich representatives are often partial delegates and partial\ntrustees.\n\nOther political theorists have asked us to rethink central aspects of\nour understanding of democratic representation. In Inclusion and\nDemocracy Iris Marion Young asks us to rethink the importance of\ndescriptive representation. Young stresses that attempts to include\nmore voices in the political arena can suppress other voices. She\nillustrates this point using the example of a Latino representative\nwho might inadvertently represent straight Latinos at the expense of\ngay and lesbian Latinos (1986, 350). For Young, the suppression of\ndifferences is a problem for all representation (1986, 351).\nRepresentatives of large districts or of small communities must\nnegotiate the difficulty of one person representing many. Because such\na difficulty is constitutive of representation, it is unreasonable to\nassume that representation should be characterized by a\n\u201crelationship of identity.\u201d The legitimacy of a\nrepresentative is not primarily a function of his or her similarities\nto the represented. For Young, the representative should not be\ntreated as a substitute for the represented. Consequently, Young\nrecommends reconceptualizing representation as a differentiated\nrelationship (2000, 125\u2013127; 1986, 357). There are two main\nbenefits of Young\u2019s understanding of representation. First, her\nunderstanding of representation encourages us to recognize the\ndiversity of those being represented. Second, her analysis of\nrepresentation emphasizes the importance of recognizing how\nrepresentative institutions include as well as they exclude.\nDemocratic citizens need to remain vigilant about the ways in which\nproviding representation for some groups comes at the expense of\nexcluding others. Building on Young\u2019s insight, Suzanne Dovi\n(2009) has argued that we should not conceptualize representation\nsimply in terms of how we bring marginalized groups into democratic\npolitics; rather, democratic representation can require limiting the\ninfluence of overrepresented privileged groups.\n\nMoreover, based on this way of understanding political representation,\nYoung provides an alterative account of democratic representation.\nSpecifically, she envisions democratic representation as a dynamic\nprocess, one that moves between moments of authorization and moments\nof accountability (2000, 129). It is the movement between these\nmoments that makes the process \u201cdemocratic.\u201d This fluidity\nallows citizens to authorize their representatives and for\ntraces of that authorization to be evident in what the\nrepresentatives do and how representatives are held accountable. The\nappropriateness of any given representative is therefore partially\ndependent on future behavior as well as on his or her past\nrelationships. For this reason, Young maintains that evaluation of\nthis process must be continuously \u201cdeferred.\u201d We must\nassess representation dynamically, that is, assess the whole ongoing\nprocesses of authorization and accountability of representatives.\nYoung\u2019s discussion of the dynamic of representation emphasizes\nthe ways in which evaluations of representatives are incomplete,\nneeding to incorporate the extent to which democratic citizens need to\nsuspend their evaluations of representatives and the extent to which\nrepresentatives can face unanticipated issues.\n\nAnother insight about democratic representation that comes from the\nliterature on descriptive representation is the importance of\ncontingencies. Here the work of Jane Mansbridge on descriptive\nrepresentation has been particularly influential. Mansbridge\nrecommends that we evaluate descriptive representatives by contexts\nand certain functions. More specifically, Mansbridge (1999, 628)\nfocuses on four functions and their related contexts in which\ndisadvantaged groups would want to be represented by someone who\nbelongs to their group. Those four functions are \u201c(1) adequate\ncommunication in contexts of mistrust, (2) innovative thinking in\ncontexts of uncrystallized, not fully articulated, interests, \u2026\n(3) creating a social meaning of \u2018ability to rule\u2019 for\nmembers of a group in historical contexts where the ability has been\nseriously questioned and (4) increasing the polity\u2019s de facto\nlegitimacy in contexts of past discrimination.\u201d For Mansbridge,\ndescriptive representatives are needed when marginalized groups\ndistrust members of relatively more privileged groups and when\nmarginalized groups possess political preferences that have not been\nfully formed. The need for descriptive representation is contingent on\ncertain functions.\n\nMansbridge\u2019s insight about the contingency of descriptive\nrepresentation suggests that at some point descriptive representatives\nmight not be necessary. However, she doesn\u2019t specify how we are\nto know if interests have become crystallized or trust has formed to\nthe point that the need for descriptive representation would be\nobsolete. Thus, Mansbridge\u2019s discussion of descriptive\nrepresentation suggests that standards for evaluating representatives\nare fluid and flexible. For an interesting discussion of the problems\nwith unified or fixed standards for evaluating Latino representatives,\nsee Christina Beltran\u2019s The Trouble with Unity.\n\nMansbridge\u2019s discussion of descriptive representation points to\nanother trend within the literature on political representation\n\u2014 namely, the trend to derive normative accounts of\nrepresentation from the representative\u2019s function. Russell\nHardin (2004) captured this trend most clearly in his position that\n\u201cif we wish to assess the morality of elected officials, we must\nunderstand their function as our representatives and then infer how\nthey can fulfill this function.\u201d For Hardin, only an empirical\nexplanation of the role of a representative is necessary for\ndetermining what a representative should be doing. Following Hardin,\nSuzanne Dovi (2007) identifies three democratic standards for\nevaluating the performance of representatives: those of\nfair-mindedness, critical trust building, and good gate-keeping. In\nRuling Passions, Andrew Sabl (2002) links the proper behavior\nof representatives to their particular office. In particular, Sabl\nfocuses on three offices: senator, organizer and activist. He argues\nthat the same standards should not be used to evaluate these different\noffices. Rather, each office is responsible for promoting democratic\nconstancy, what Sabl understands as \u201cthe effective pursuit of\ninterest.\u201d Sabl (2002) and Hardin (2004) exemplify the trend to\ntie the standards for evaluating political representatives to the\nactivity and office of those representatives.\n",
