    "main_text": "Metaphysics || God\n1.1 God\n\nAccording to Astell, God is the \u201cFirst Intelligence,\u201d the\nbeing whose nature is to be infinite in all perfections. When writing\nabout God\u2019s perfections, Astell often lists wisdom, goodness,\njustice, holiness, intelligence, presence, power, and self-existence.\nIn keeping with rationalist views of the period, Astell maintains that\nthe correct understanding of metaphysics turns on the correct\nunderstanding of God. For this reason, much of her work is dedicated\nto demonstrating not only what God is, but also how a correct\nunderstanding of God can be attained.\n\nHer earliest such account is in A Serious Proposal to the\nLadies, where she demonstrates the existence, perfection, and\nnecessary creative power of God. There she gives an example of the\ncorrect method for attaining knowledge, one similar to those developed\nby Descartes in Discourse on the Method and by Arnauld and\nNicole in Logic or the Art of Thinking (see section 3.2 of\nthis entry). Her proof of God\u2019s existence includes an account of\nsimple and composed ideas; clear and distinct perceptions; obscure and\nconfused perceptions; adequate and inadequate ideas; proofs by\nintuition and proofs by comparison of ideas; God\u2019s perfections\nand our ideas of them; and the relation between ideas and terms\n(Astell SP, 176\u2013182). In Christian Religion, she frames\nother arguments for God\u2019s existence in terms of what we can and\ncannot doubt; God\u2019s perfections and our ideas of them;\ncausality; and the beauty of the created universe (Astell 1705,\n7\u201310 [sections 7\u201310]).\n\nAt times, Astell privileges some of God\u2019s perfections over\nothers: sometimes emphasizing self-existence above all perfections,\nother times focusing no goodness and wisdom over omnipotence. For\nexample, in Christian Religion, when stating her ontological\nargument for God\u2019s existence, she notes that \u201cI find that\nthe notion I have of GOD, contains those and all other perfections.\nAmong which Self-existence is most remarkable, as being the original\nand basis of all the rest\u201d (Astell 1705, 8 [section 7]). This\nclaim is about the order of ideas: her idea of God\u2019s\nself-existence allows her to understand God\u2019s other perfections.\nA few lines later, she makes the analogous claim about the order of\nreality: \u201cAnd Self-existence is such a Perfection as necessarily\nincludes all other perfections\u201d (section 8).\n\nBroad (2002a, 103) presents evidence that Astell privileges\nGod\u2019s wisdom and goodness over his omnipotence. There are two\nways that philosophers of the period thought about God\u2019s\nattributes of wisdom, power, and goodness. Some held\n\u201cintellectualist\u201d theories, according to which God\nexercises his will in accordance with the true nature of things;\nothers held \u201cvoluntarist\u201d theories, according to which God\nexercises his will to create both things and the truth of things. In\nshowing that Astell maintains an intellectualist theology, Broad\nrefers to a number of passages, one of which is the following:\n\nThis is then the sum of the matter; GOD who is Infinite in all\nPerfections, in Justice and Holiness, as well as in Goodness and\nMercy, always does what is best and most becoming His Perfections, and\ncannot act but according to the Essential Nature and Reason of things;\nnor is it possible that our Wishes or Actions shou\u2019d make any\nalteration in the immutable Rectitude of His Conduct.
