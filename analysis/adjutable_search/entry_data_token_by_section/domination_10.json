    "main_text": "What Kind of Power Is Domination? || Moralized, Norm-Dependent Theories\n4.4 Moralized, Norm-Dependent Theories\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like we must appeal to moral concepts to say\nwhether a powerful person can or cannot dictate social norms; but, for\nan influential cluster of theories, the norm-dependence of domination\nis constructed in specifically moral terms. This is an understandable\nmove. After all, if we think domination is always expressed through\nnorms, and we think that domination is morally illegitimate\neven when socially legitimate, it makes sense to think of domination\nas a specific failure to reckon with morally legitimate\nnorms. For theories of domination that are moralized as well as\nnorm-dependent, we diagnose domination not just as power expressed\nthrough authority claims, but as a specific kind of morally\nillegitimate authority. \n\nGiven that the most influential moralized/norm-dependent\ntheories\u2014Henry Richardson\u2019s and Rainer\nForst\u2019s\u2014developed either within or in direct response to\nneorepublicanism, it is not surprising to find here a similar\ntwo-movement approach to domination; first giving an account of power\nmanifest in domination but also in benign forms of power, and second,\ngiving an account of what makes domination distinct and unjust. For\nRichardson, the broader category of benign or even legitimate power is\nthe power to \u201cmodify the rights and duties of others\u201d\n(2002: 34). An agent may have this power without dominating anyone;\ndominators exercise an unauthorized variety of this \u201cnormative\npower\u201d. Richardson here is motivated again by the desire to\nsteer around what he thinks are neorepublican false positives:\ncriminals like the mob boss do not, he claims, dominate. If an\nuncontrolled capacity to interfere with choice dominates, we are\ndominated by the mere possibility that our neighbors will slash our\ntires in the night. Secret tire-slashing may be arbitrary\nchoice-interference, but it serves no obvious role in wielding\nnormative power.\n\nForst favors the language of reasons in identifying the\nbroader category of power of which domination is a subset. All social\npower, he says, is power \u201cwithin the space of\nreasons\u201d\u2014specifically justifying reasons. This is\nwhy he calls his account of power noumenal: power is not\nbased merely on the control of material resources, but instead on\ninfluence over what other agents see as justified thought or action.\nThat you have a lot of some material resource\u2014say,\nmoney\u2014is irrelevant from the perspective of power unless you can\nuse it to alter what others think they have most reason to do. In\ngeneral, Forst says, power is \u201cthe capacity of A to\nmotivate B to think or do something that B would\notherwise not have thought or done\u201d (2015: 115). It is clear\nenough that such power has innocent varieties: when a teacher shows a\nstudent a new way to solve a math problem, they motivate them to think\nand do in ways they would not otherwise. Gentle persuasion between\nfriends manifests the same power.\n\nSo, both Richardson and Forst try to situate domination within a\nbroader, essentially normative phenomenon, the power to place others\nunder [supposed] duties or the power to affect what others regard as\njustified. What, then, makes domination distinct and unjust? For both\nRichardson and Forst, domination involves a violation of our rights\nrelative to the normative domain. Dominators claim authority or power\nwithin the space of reasons that properly belongs to the dominated.\nDomination is power unbound by the moral standing of its victims as\nco-authors of the norms that bind them. For Richardson, who focuses\nspecifically on power in the political context, the arbitrariness of\nnormative power manifests itself along several moralized dimensions:\ndominating power fails to express \u201cfair\u201d deliberative\nprocesses among \u201cfree and equal citizens\u201d that respect\n\u201cfundamental rights and liberties\u201d (2002: 52). The slave\nmaster dominates because he takes for himself a power that belongs\nproperly to his slaves: we have a moral right to decide together what\nour political rights and duties will be. He is able to do this because\nhis role as a master of slaves has institutional support. If one of\nhis slaves runs away, he can call on the state to track the slave down\nand return them. This is how real dominators are distinct from deluded\nclaimants to normative power. Imagine a mob boss who comes to believe\nthat he speaks for God. He might believe that he has a power to create\nrights and duties; even so, without social and legal backing analogous\nto what a tyrant or slave master or patriarch can depend on, the mob\nboss will not succeed even in creating illegitimate rights and\nduties\u2014and so will fail to dominate on a theory like\nRichardson\u2019s. \n\nSimilarly, Forst measures dominating power against an explicitly\nmoralized baseline\u2014power dominates to the extent that it is\nexercised outside a structure of democratic institutions designed to\nsecure and respect the equal authority of each citizen to offer and\nreceive adequate justifications (Forst 2013). Noumenal power within\nsocial relationships becomes domination when agents within that\nrelationship are denied their right to justification: i.e., their\nright to participate as free equals in the space of reasons (2015:\n116\u2013117). Interestingly, Forst\u2019s theory, like\nBlunt\u2019s non-moralized theory and unlike Richardson\u2019s,\napparently allows for domination outside official structures of\nauthority. Dominators, Forst says, \u201cseal off\u201d the space of\nreasons by denying our right to receive and offer adequate\njustifications, but there are many ways to do this. One way is simply\nthrough the threat of violence. If a mob boss has all the guns and\nmuscle, he will be able to crowd the shop owner completely out of the\njustificatory space. What the shop owner might believe about what they\nhave reason to think and do is irrelevant, given the price they will\npay for non-compliance.\n\nAgain, if we understand the power required for domination as a kind of\nauthority, it makes sense to diagnose the presence or absence of\ndomination in terms of illicit authority. When illicit\nnormative authority counts as such because it is claimed by a powerful\nfew, we are pushed firmly in the direction of a reckoning with the\nnormative authority of all. Of course, once this reckoning has begun,\nit is natural to diagnose domination in broadly Kantian terms as the\nabsence of institutions securing respect for our autonomy. (See Bohman\n2004 for a similar approach applied to international relations.)\n\nNorm-dependent or moralized theories identify domination with some\nvarieties of unrestrained asymmetric power and not others, whether it\nbe power to dictate the norms of a social relationship, to establish\nlegitimizing narratives, to alter the shape of our supposed rights and\nduties, to close us off from the space of reasons, to violate our\nbasic interests, or to do us wrong. This makes them more vulnerable to\nthe possibility that domination can take some form not captured by any\nof these specific powers. Lovett\u2014an advocate of a non-moralized,\nnorm-independent theory\u2014worries that moralized or norm-dependent\ntheories tend toward a kind of historical or cultural myopia, seeing\ndomination only in whatever \u201cforms of social power happen to be\nthe predominant instruments of domination\u201d here and now or in\ntime gone by (2010: 92). He recommends we see some of the powers\nhighlighted by moralized or norm-dependent theories as varieties of\ndomination, but remain alert to other forms it might assume. Of\ncourse, devotees of moralization or norm-dependency may respond that\nthe leading non-moralized/norm-independent contenders see domination\nwhere there is none, fail to see its specific threat, or cry\n\u201cdomination\u201d where some other social evil is really the\nproblem.\n",
