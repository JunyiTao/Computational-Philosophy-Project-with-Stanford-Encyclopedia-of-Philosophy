    "main_text": "Heidegger for Art, Introduction:  The Three Pillars of Heidegger\u2019s Understanding of Art || The Phenomenological Approach to Art\n3.2 The Phenomenological Approach to Art\n\n\nTo encounter the paradoxical movement at rest within a great artwork\n(the mysterious movement that, Hammermeister nicely suggests, enables\nart to move us in turn), Heidegger believes we need only follow the\nphenomenological dictum that we should \u201csimply describe\u201d\nour experience of the work of art \u201cwithout any philosophical\ntheory\u201d (PLT 32/GA5\n 18).[46]\nThe phenomenological approach to art\nobliges us to\n\n\nrestrain from all usual doing and prizing, knowing and looking, in\norder to linger within the truth that is happening in the work.\nOnly the restraint of this lingering allows what is created to first be\nthe work that it is. (PLT 66/GA5\n 54)[47]\n\n\nYet, simply \u201cto let a being be the way it is [wie es\nist]\u201d turns out to be \u201cthe most difficult of\ntasks\u201d (PLT 31/GA5 16). For, insofar as the concepts we use\nto make sense of our experience remain uninterrogated as to their own\nbuilt-in interpretive biases, we tend not even to notice when\ninappropriate conceptual categories lead us to a distorted or\ninadequate apprehension of the phenomenon at issue.\n\n\nPhenomenology\u2019s ideal of pure description thus requires us to\nstruggle vigilantly against our usual tendency to force the square peg\nof recalcitrant experience into the round hole of ready-made conceptual\ncategories. (For example, since metaphysics tells us that things\nat rest cannot move, we are inclined to dismiss any inkling of movement\nin an artwork as some sort of idiosyncratic, subjective projection on\nour parts.) In order truly to be open to the way things show\nthemselves to us, then, we have \u201cto keep at a distance all\npreconceptions and interfering misconceptions\u201d [Vor- und\n\u00dcbergriffe] of what things are. Rather\nthan giving us license simply to do what comes \u201cnaturally,\u201d\nfollowing Husserl\u2019s famed phenomenological\ndictum\u2014\u201cBack to the things\nthemselves!\u201d\u2014requires us to struggle to discern and\nneutralize the usually unnoticed metaphysical presuppositions (such as\nthe modern assumption of a fundamental subject/object dichotomy) which,\nalthough they remain \u201cderivative\u201d of more basic experiences\nthat they cannot explain, nevertheless continue to pass themselves off\nas \u201cself-evident\u201d and so lead modern aesthetics off track\n(PLT 31/GA5 16).\n\n\nIt is not a coincidence that Van Gogh\u2019s painting is the first\nexample of an actual work of art that Heidegger mentions in \u201cThe\nOrigin of the Work of Art,\u201d and the context is revealing.\nHeidegger is introducing the concept of a \u201cthing,\u201d a\nseemingly obvious idea the complex history of which he then goes on to\nexplicate and deconstruct in detail (PLT 20\u201330/GA5 5\u201316), thereby\nundermining its initial appearance of\n obviousness.[48]\nBy showing that none of the three\nstandard metaphysical conceptions of a thing (which conceive of a thing\nvariously as \u201cthe bearer of traits, as the unity of a sensory\nmanifold, and as formed matter\u201d [PLT 30/GA5 15]) manages to\ncapture fully our sense of what things are, Heidegger is able to make\nthe crucial suggestion that there is something about a thing which\neludes all our attempts to capture and express it conceptually:\n\n\nThe inconspicuous thing withdraws itself from thought most\nstubbornly. Or can it be that this self-refusal of the mere\nthing, this self-contained refusal to be pushed around, belongs\nprecisely to the essential nature of things? (PLT 31\u20132/GA5\n17)\n\n\nBy suggesting that an ineliminable elusiveness\u2014an independence\nfrom human designs\u2014is in fact essential to what things are,\nHeidegger is motivating his own concept of the \u201cearth\u201d as\nwhat both informs and resists conceptualization. (Indeed, this\ncrucial insight that there is something essential to things that\nresists human control seems to be what motivates Heidegger to make the\ntransition from talking about the \u201cnothing\u201d to discussing\nthe \u201cearth,\u201d as we will see.) At the same time,\nHeidegger is also illustrating the phenomenological dictum that our\ncommon-sense view of things\u2014although it appears\n\u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cself-evident\u201d\u2014is often\nfreighted with unnoticed metaphysical presuppositions that can eclipse\nand so prevent a full encounter with the phenomena we face. By\nrevealing the limitations of Western philosophy\u2019s metaphysical\nconceptions of what \u201cthings\u201d are, Heidegger gives a\nconcrete demonstration of his critical-phenomenological (and obviously\nNietzsche-influenced) view that: \u201cWhat seems natural to us\nis presumably just the familiarity of a long-established custom which\nhas forgotten the unfamiliarity from which it arose\u201d (PLT 24/GA5\n9).\n\n\nThe fact that Heidegger\u2019s first mention of Van Gogh is framed\nby these two ways of undermining our usual sense of the obviousness of\nthings should lead us to suspect that he is introducing an ordinary\nidea that he will subsequently use phenomenology to try to excavate\nbeneath and so go beyond. Once we recognize the context, it is not difficult to detect\nthe irony in Heidegger\u2019s initial suggestion that \u201cartworks\nare familiar to everyone\u201d already since they populate our world\njust like all the other objects \u201con hand\u201d:\n\n\nOne [Man] finds works of architecture and sculpture erected\nin public places, in churches, and in private dwellings.\n\u2026Works are of course on hand [vorhanden, i.e.,\nobjectively present] like any other thing. The picture hangs on\nthe wall like a rifle or a hat. A painting, for example the one\nby Van Gogh that represents a pair of farmer\u2019s shoes, travels\nfrom one exhibit to another. Works are shipped like coal from the\nRuhr and logs from the Black Forest. (PLT 19/GA5 3)\n\n\nIn fact, it is clear that for Heidegger the very obviousness of the\npublic knowledge that artworks are objects and that they\nrepresent things conceals the more \u201coriginal\u201d\ntruths about art which he seeks to uncover in \u201cThe Origin of the\nWork of\n Art.\u201d[49]\n\n\nThat the initial familiarity of the anonymous \u201ceveryone\u201d\n(jedermann) with art objects and representational paintings\nturns out to be a superficial acquaintance that covers over the true\ndepths of the matter at issue should not be surprising.  Almost a\ndecade earlier, when Being and Time famously sought to\ndisclose the ubiquitous and thus usually unnoticed ways in which the\nanonymous \u201cone [das Man] unfolds its true\ndictatorship,\u201d Heidegger had already observed that \u201cwe\nread, see, and judge literature and art the way one sees and\njudges.\u201d So, for example, \u201ceveryone knows\u201d that Da\nVinci\u2019s\n \u201cMona Lisa\u201d\nis a great work of art; we think we\n\u201cknow\u201d this even if the painting has never spoken to us at\nall, or if we have only heard that \u201cthey say\u201d the enigmatic\nhint of a smile on her face is supposed to suggest the numinous\npresence of God, or the wry smirk of a secret lover, or, more recently,\nthat the sublime elusiveness of her smile finally can be\n\u201cexplained\u201d by neuroscientific findings about the way our\nbrains process different spatial\n frequencies.[50]\nThrough this kind of\n\u201cleveling down\u201d to a publicly-accessible, take-home\nmessage,\n\n\neverything primordial gets glossed over as something long\nfamiliar. Everything gained by a struggle becomes just something\nto be manipulated. Every mystery loses its power. (BT\n164\u20135/SZ 126\u20137)\n\n\n\u201cThe Origin [Ursprung] of the Work of Art\u201d\nsuggests, conversely, that by struggling personally with the mysteries\nat work in Van Gogh\u2019s painting of a \u201cA Pair of\nShoes,\u201d we can gain an insight into art\u2019s most\n\u201cprimordial\u201d (or \u201coriginal,\u201d\nUrspr\u00fcngliche) level of truth.\n\n\nUnfortunately, it is quite difficult to present the deepest truths\nthat emerge from the kind of personal struggle that existential\nphenomenology demands without thereby inadvertently supplying the\npublic with another leveled-down formula to bandy about, a familiar\ncatchphrase (like \u201clanguage is the house of being\u201d) that\nquickly becomes a superficial substitute for the insight it\nbespeaks. The problem, expressed metaphorically, is that\nreceiving a souvenir from someone else\u2019s journey makes a poor\nsubstitute for taking that voyage for oneself. Heidegger\u2019s\nrecognition of this difficulty helps explain why he seeks to\nshow at least as much as to say what he takes to be\nart\u2019s deepest truths in \u201cThe Origin of the Work of\nArt.\u201d Indeed, the distinguishing mark of the later\nHeidegger\u2019s \u201cpoetic\u201d style comes from the fact that,\nafter Being and Time, he is no longer content simply to\nconstruct arguments in relatively straightforward philosophical prose,\nbut also begins to try to lead his audience performatively to see the\nphenomenon ultimately at issue for themselves. This is a large\npart of what makes Heidegger\u2019s later works even more elusive and\nchallenging for contemporary philosophical readers than Being and\n Time.[51]\nNonetheless, by drawing on\nHeidegger\u2019s early as well as his later works, we can clearly\nunderstand the enduring philosophical challenge that his\nphenomenological approach to art seeks to surmount.\n",
