    "main_text": "Alexander of Aphrodisias and the Aristotelian Tradition in the 1st and 2nd century CE\n3. Alexander of Aphrodisias and the Aristotelian Tradition in the 1st and 2nd century CE\n\nThe revival of interest in the philosophy of Aristotle outlived the\n1st century BCE. The exegetical activity on\nAristotle\u2019works continued to flourish in the 1st and\n2nd century CE. New layers of interpretation were added in\nthese two centuries. They greatly contributed to the formation of the\nexegetical tradition that found its culmination in the commentaries of\nAlexander of Aphrodisias.\n\nAlexander of Aegae wrote about the Categories (Simplicius,\nIn Cat. 10.20; 13.16) and the De caelo (Simplicius,\nIn DC 430.29\u201332). Since he is said to have been teacher\nof the Emperor Nero, his exegetical activity can be dated to the first\nhalf of the 1st century CE. Nothing can be said about the\nform of his literary production. This is also the case of two other\ninterpreters of the Categories: Sotion and Achaius\n(Simplicius, In Cat. 159.23). Although their exegetical\nactivity is much more difficult to date, there is one line of argument\nthat places it in the 1st century CE. The information at\nour disposal is frustratingly meagre, but it is hard to escape the\nconclusion that the Categories continued to be at the centre\nof the exegetical activity on the philosophy of Aristotle. The\nsituation did not change in the first half of the 2nd\ncentury CE. From Galen we learn that Adrastus of Aphrodisias and\nAspasius wrote elementary commentaries on the Categories.\nFrom the way Galen refers to these commentaries, they must have been\neasily available and routinely used to introduce students to the\nCategories. Adrastus and Aspasius established themselves as\nrespected interpreters of Aristotle. We know that their commentaries\nwere still used about one hundred years later by the great Plotinus\n(Porphyry, Life of Plotinus. 14.12\u201314). Aspasius did\nnot confine his exegetical activity to the Categories. He\nwrote commentaries on the De Interpretatione, the\nPhysics, and the Metaphysics. These commentaries\nwere used and quoted by later generations of commentators. The\nreputation that Aspasius enjoyed in antiquity explains why his\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Ethics has survived. This\ncommentary is the earliest surviving commentary on an Aristotelian\ntext.\n\nOne significant impact on the way the practice of philosophy developed\ntoward the end of the 2nd century CE was the intervention\nof the imperial power in matters of education. This intervention seems\nto go as far back as the Emperor Antoninus Pius, who is said to have\nestablished public chairs of rhetoric and philosophy in the provinces.\nBut it was Marcus Aurelius who first established Imperial chairs of\nphilosophy in Athens in 176 CE. From our ancient sources we are told\nthat those chairs were in Platonic, Stoic, Peripatetic, and Epicurean\nphilosophy. In all probability, the first holder of the chair in\nAristotelian philosophy was Alexander of Damascus, an older\ncontemporary of Galen described by him as \u201cknowledgeable about\nthe doctrines of Plato but more inclined to those of Aristotle\u201d\n(Galen, De praenotione XIV 627\u2013628 K\u00fchn). The\nholder of the Imperial chairs of philosophy was a public teacher and\nreceived an annual salary. His teaching consisted in lecturing on the\ntexts of the founder of the school. Alexander of Aphrodisias was one\nof these teachers publicly appointed to a chair of Aristotelian\nphilosophy. Alexander refers to himself as a teacher\u2014namely, a\ndidaskalos (De fato 164.15). As a teacher of\nAristotelian philosophy, Alexander was concerned not only with\nexplicating this philosophy but also with defending it in the context\nof debates between philosophical schools. His attitude toward\nAristotle is best expressed at the very beginning of his De\nanima. This treatise is not a commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nDe anima but an investigation of the soul based on the\nprinciples established in Aristotle\u2019s De anima. The\ntask that here Alexander sets for himself is that of clarifying and\npromoting the views of Aristotle:\n\nIn all philosophical questions, the present writer cherishes a special\nregard for the authority of Aristotle, in the conviction that his\nteaching on these matters has greater claim to truth than that of\nother philosophers. The purpose of this present treatise will\ntherefore be satisfactorily accomplished if the doctrine of the soul\nwhich I here set forth is as clear an exposition as possible of what\nAristotle has said on this subject; and I shall limit my own\ncontribution to explanations of the specific points that Aristotle\nhimself has so excellently stated. (Alexander, De anima 2.\n5\u20139, translation after Fotinis)\n\n\nAlexander wrote commentaries on most (but not all) of\nAristotle\u2019s treatises.  His commentaries on the Prior\nAnalytics (Book 1), Topics, Meteorology, and\nthe work On Sense and Sense Objects have survived. Fragments\nfrom his lost commentaries on the Posterior Analytics and\nPhysics have been collected and edited (in Moraux 1979 and\nRashed 2011, respectively). A long excerpt from his lost commentary on\nGeneration and Corruption, extant only in the Arabic\ntradition, is now available in English translation (Gannag\u00e9\n2005). Of the commentary on the Metaphysics that is\ntransmitted under his name, only the first five books (Alfa\nto Delta) are genuine. Since Praetcher (Praetcher 1906) the\ncommentary on the other books (Epsilon to Nu) is\ngenerally attributed to Michael of Ephesus. This attribution is now\nvindicated (in Luna 2001) except for book Epsilon, which\nshould be attributed to Stephanus of Alexandria (Golitsis 2016b). The\ncommentary on the Sophistical Refutations, traditionally\nattributed to Alexander, is spurious. It should be attributed to\nMichael of Ephesus (Ebbesen 1981, I: 268\u2013285).\nAlthough Alexander is best known for his\ncommentaries on Aristotle, his exegetical activity extended to include\nshort discussions on specific points of interpretation within\nAristotelian philosophy. These discussions are collected in four books\nof Problems and Solutions and in a further book traditionally\nknown as Mantissa (literally, \u201cMakeweight\u201d). These\ncollections offer an eloquent illustration of the extraordinary\nvariety of exegetical methods deployed in the exposition of\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy. Up to a point, the deployment of such a\nvariety of exegetical methods can be explained with reference to the\npedagogic function of these writings, which were used as teaching\ntools in the instruction of students with different levels of\nknowledge of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy. \n\nAlexander\u2019s exegetical activity ultimately consisted in an\neffort of systematization combined with an attempt to extract what he\nregarded as the genuine thought of Aristotle. It was this loyalty to\nthe philosophy of the master coupled with the finesse of his\ninterpretation that gained Alexander the reputation of \u201cthe most\nauthentic interpreter of Aristotle\u201d (Simplicius, In\nPhys. 80.16). His commentaries set standards of interpretations\nthat remained largely unsurpassed in antiquity and beyond. But it is\nimportant to realize that his extraordinary accomplishment was the\nculmination of the exegetical tradition that had started in the\n1st century BCE. More to the point: Alexander was not the\nfirst but rather the last authentic interpreter of Aristotle. Although\nsubsequent generations of commentators were profoundly influenced by\nAlexander, they were motivated by a very different exegetical\nideal. Their primary aim was no longer to recover and preserve\nAristotle\u2019s thought for its own sake, but rather for the sake of\nfinding agreement between Aristotle and Plato and presenting the two\nphilosophers as part of one and the same philosophical outlook.
