    "main_text": "Thermal Awareness\n5. Thermal Awareness\nPhilosophers have long been interested in the thermal system. As\nnoted above, thermal properties are difficult to connect with other\ntangible features for both spatial and intensity views. On either view,\nit seems difficult to make sense of the unique structure and bodily\nrole played by our thermoreceptive systems. One possibility for this\ndifficulty may be due to the fact that thermal properties\nare secondary qualities. A secondary quality is one that (in\nsome manner) crucially depends on our subjective awareness.\n  \nThe idea is that out in the world there really is no such thing as\n\u201chot\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d. Instead, there are only\ndiffering amounts of temperature or mean kinetic energy. We feel\nsomething much more structured than this through our skin (a fact most\nkeenly developed in Gray 2012). We feel objects as very cold, to cool,\nand then on to neutral, and only within a fairly narrow total\nrange. After this neutral point, objects take on an entirely different\ncharacter, and start to feel warm, followed by hot (again, up to a\nlimit). This space of thermal awareness involves a kind of inversion\nthrough a neutral point. But this neutral point is unique to human\nexperience; there is no neutral point in the temperature taken\nobjectively. More importantly, the temperatures that we typically feel\nas neutral depends on the context and especially on the current\nthermal conditions of our body and sensory surfaces.\nThis presents something of a problem for our naive conception of\nthermal awareness. We generally tend to think that our awareness of\nhot and cold provides objective or at least useful information about\nactual temperature. We use it to check baby bottles, determine if the\nheater is on, and make sure the bath isn\u2019t going to scald us. If\ninstead, thermal awareness only gives us awareness of a purely\nsubjective experience only loosely connected with temperature, then it\nseems thermal awareness isn\u2019t quite what we generally take it to\nbe. A warm stimuli feels cold when our bodies are already heated, but\nit feels hot when our bodies are in a cold state. This difference can\nbe experienced at once by simultaneously heating one hand in hot water\nand cooling another in an ice bath, and exposing them both to a\nneutral water bath. The same water will feel hot and cold at the same\ntime.\nThermal awareness, and its unsteady connection to objective\ntemperature, has been used to argue that sensory systems generally\naren\u2019t in the business of (only) conveying objective sensory\ninformation (Akins 1996). Instead, it seems to only convey\ninformation about our current bodily state (Craig 2002). If this is\nright, then it might explain some well\u2013known but puzzling\nphenomena, such as metal feeling cool to the touch, and wood feeling\nwarm, even when they are of the same objective temperature. It also\nexplains our different levels of thermal awareness for body parts at\ndifferent temperatures.\n",
