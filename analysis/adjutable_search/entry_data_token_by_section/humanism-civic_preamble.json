    "main_text": "\n\nAlthough widely and commonly confused with republicanism, civic\nhumanism forms a separate and distinct phenomenon in the history of\nWestern political thought. Republicanism is a political philosophy\nthat defends a concept of freedom as non-domination, and identifies\nthe institutions that protect it (Pettit 1999). In particular,\nrepublicanism stands against two alternative theories of politics. The\nfirst is despotism, especially as manifested in any form of one-man\nrule; a republic is self-governing, and so are its denizens. The\nsecond is liberalism, which posits the primacy of the autonomous\nindividual vis-\u00e0-vis public order and government; the\nrepublican values civic engagement in order to realize a form of\nliberty achievable only in and through the community. Republican\ntheorists sometimes refer to writings by historically antecedent\nauthors, such as Aristotle or Machiavelli, but their concern is not\nprimarily accurate interpretation. Rather, to the extent that they\nshow an interest in the past, it is as a source of ideas that they\nfind useful.\n\nBy contrast, civic humanism is a historiographical construct. As\nconventionally employed by scholars, the term refers to a group of\nthinkers who emerged during the period of the Italian Renaissance,\nespecially in Florence, and who were committed to public engagement\n(in theory as well as practice) and whose values were fundamentally\nantithetical to the medieval past. The \u201cinvention\u201d of\ncivic humanism is primarily associated with Hans Baron\n(1900\u20131988), the famed German-American historian (Fubini 1992).\nAlthough he first used the phrase in its original German form\n(B\u00fcrgerhumanismus) as early as 1925, its popularity\nstems from the publication in 1955 of his classic book The Crisis\nof the Early Italian Renaissance: Civic Humanism and Republican\nLiberty in an Age of Classicism and Tyranny (revised 1966). In\nthis volume, as well as in later writings that built upon it (many\ncollected in Baron 1968 and 1988), he developed what has come to be\ncalled the \u201cBaron thesis\u201d (Witt 1996; Hankins 1995). Baron\nwas not, however, the first scholar to propose that the form of\nhumanism that emerged during the fifteenth century in the Italian\ncities mainly promoted the civic vita activa rather than the\nliterary and philological pursuits ordinarily ascribed to the\nhumanists. In two books from 1952 and 1954, written and published in\nItalian, Eugenio Garin defended a position almost identical to that of\nBaron\u2019s: Renaissance humanism, especially as propounded in\nFlorence, reflects a pronounced shift from the emphasis on\ncontemplation typical of the Middle Ages to the priority of civil\naction to attain a common good (Garin 1947 [1965]). (If not for purely\ncontingent reasons, the historiographical label for civic humanism\nmight readily have been \u201cthe Garin thesis\u201d.) In the\npresent context, it should be noted that some advocates of civic\nhumanism were disposed toward republicanism, but the latter is not\nentailed by the former.\n",
