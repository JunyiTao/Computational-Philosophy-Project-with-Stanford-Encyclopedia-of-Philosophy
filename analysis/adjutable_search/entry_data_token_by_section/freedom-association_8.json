    "main_text": "The Right to Exit\n5. The Right to Organizational Autonomy\n\nThe right to organizational autonomy intersects with both the right to\nexclude and the right to exit since, typically, associates want not\njust to do certain things together, but to do those things with\ncertain people and not other people. Indeed, in the eyes of many\nassociations, the things they do wouldn\u2019t be those same things\nif they couldn\u2019t exclude unwanted people from joining them, or\nif they couldn\u2019t exercise control over their own\nparticipation.\n\nMaintaining rights to organizational autonomy does not necessarily\nissue in liberal practices (Alexander 2008: 14). The right of the\nfamily to operate, unimpeached, according to patriarchal values, the\nright of unions to maintain hierarchical decision procedures, and the\nrights of churches to refuse women access to positions of authority,\nare all consequences of those associations being allowed to shape\ntheir organization without outside interference. These rights find\ntheir limits when they do indefensible harm to members, particularly\nto those members who cannot consent.\n\nFocusing on mutually voluntary associations, what kinds of\nassociations do we have the right to consent to join? And, what kinds\nof conduct do we have the right to engage in as associates? For\ninstance, can we have a right to voluntarily become a slave and our\nassociate the master, an association that would deny us all prospects\nto make other associative decisions even if our master treats us\nkindly? Less radically, do we have a right to consent to harmful\nrelations, such as sadomasochistic sexual relations, or to\nlife-threatening connections, such as a marriage with a highly\ncontagious asymptomatic carrier of typhoid or a marriage with a person\nwho suffers from psychopathy? Our answers will depend partly on how we\nconceive of autonomy. If autonomous agency cannot be\nself-negating, then we cannot voluntarily enslave ourselves or enter\nself-destructive relations. But, if we can autonomously do things that\neliminate all prospects for future autonomous agency such as seek\nvoluntary euthanasia, then why could we not autonomously form\nassociations that do or threaten the same thing?\n\nConsent can do the work to protect the internal operations of many\nassociations, even when the associates pose severe risks to each other\nand to themselves. But, there will be natural limits to these rights\nof organizational autonomy, despite worries about paternalism.\nLimits to the right to organizational autonomy\n\nWhen associations lack full rights to exclude or exit, they will\ninevitably lack full rights over their organizational autonomy. For\nmany years, orchestras have been required by convention to have\ncandidates audition behind a screen to ensure anonymity. The result\nhas been that orchestras have hired far more musicians from\ntraditionally under-represented groups than they did previously. In\nthe eyes of defenders of an all-male preserve like the Vienna\nPhilharmonic (which delayed admitting women as full members until\n1997, far later than any other leading orchestra), this changes the\ncharacter of the enterprise, and, some would say, costs it the vital\ncomradery and cohesion necessary for great orchestral work.\nUnsurprisingly, leading orchestras have found that wonderful work can\nbe produced by a diverse company of musicians. What matters is the\nperformers\u2019 musical ability and their ability to work well\ntogether. Their gender and ethnicity are, or should be, irrelevant to\nthose things.\n\nIn other spheres, however, features such as sex, gender or nationality\nare not irrelevant. A Taiwanese students\u2019 club at an American\nuniversity might accept, or be required to admit, non-Taiwanese\nstudents who are interested in that country. But, if non-Taiwanese\nstudents make up the majority of the club members or are running the\nshow, this will undoubtedly change the club\u2019s character and\npossibly compromise its intended organizational identity.\n\nAs already noted in connection with the right to exclude, the\nstate\u2019s compelling interests can justifiably limit\nassociations\u2019 rights to organizational autonomy (Johnson 2001).\nIn some respects, state interference with organizational autonomy is\ninevitably going to be more complex than state interference with\nassociations\u2019 efforts to exclude people: Here, the state is not\nsimply refusing, for instance, to give schools permission to bar\nstudents of color. Instead, the state is setting down limits to how\nfar a group can decide to organize itself. When the state gives an\norganization a quota that dictates how many women or people from\ndifferent ethnicities it must include, the state then insists on\nparticular patterns of inclusion. Quotas might thus be taken as an\ninstance of the state attempting to achieve more substantive forms of\nintegration. For instance, insisting on the inclusion of sufficiently\nlarge numbers of women in political parties and representative bodies\ncan aim to improve the democratic credentials of an overall\ninstitutional structure (Phillips 1998; Mansbridge 1999). Similarly,\nhaving a quota for the number of corporate board members who must be\nwomen, 40% in the case of Norway, can aim to achieve greater\nintegration as well as better working conditions for all women. In\nanother example, the US government worked to create less segregated\nschools, with programs such as Moving to Opportunity (MTO), and more\nintegrated neighbourhoods, with Chicago\u2019s Gautreaux Program.\nSuch actions can be described as attempts to bring about certain\npatterns of inclusion and connection within especially formative\nassociations, even though they sometimes go against the wishes of some\nparticipants (Anderson 2010: 119\u2013120).\n\nA potential limit to this imperative is presented by Tommie Shelby, in\nexplicit response to Elizabeth Anderson\u2019s argument for\nintegration. Shelby suggests that, in deeply unjust societies, ghettos\nperform important survivalist functions for their residents. They are\nspaces in which people can nourish a sense of community and a feeling\nof security from the familiarities of their own space, against a\nseemingly hostile outside world. To expect these residents, as\nAnderson does, to integrate into white neighborhoods is to potentially\nsacrifice those goods in the name of correcting for wider injustices,\nfor which these people are not responsible. Even if additional\n(though, empirically, potentially spurious) access to a wider field of\nsocial capital can become available by integrating, the people most\nburdened by injustice should not have to make additional sacrifices in\norder to amend those structural failures (Shelby 2016: 49\u201379).\nHere, the freedom to associate, and the functions served by already\nexisting associations, are given priority over the possibly beneficial\nassociative relations that could be developed once existing\nassociations are weakened. In addition to this freedom of association\nagainst interferences from the state, Shelby also describes the\nassociative duties and solidarities that come with\nliving in and belonging to ghetto communities (2016: 61).\nConclusion\n\nThis entry has distilled from the vast array of associations to which\nwe belong a taxonomy that highlights paradigmatic forms of association\nwhile noting how those forms overlap with each other. The entry\ndetails the values protected by the rights to exclude, to exit, and to\nexercise organizational autonomy, while also noting how, only by\nlimiting these rights, can other specific values, goods, and rights be\nachieved.\n\nThe values of association go far beyond what can be captured by\nreference to freedom of association and the rights and duties that\ngive shape to this freedom. Given our constitutive sociality, we are\ncreatures that come together with one another for all sorts of\nreasons: some good, some benign, and some nefarious. By looking to the\nwider field of values and functions performed by association, we can\nsituate freedom of association within a proper appreciation of the\ncomplex realm of associative life, and thereby gain a full sense not\nonly of the value of this freedom, but also of why such freedom might\nneed to be limited in order to pursue other values. Some of these\nalternative values will also be associative in nature (such as\nensuring simple connection to other humans, free or otherwise) and\nsome will go beyond associative values altogether, to include the\nvalues of security, equality or economic efficiency.\n",
