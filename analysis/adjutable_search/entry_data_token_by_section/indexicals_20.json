    "main_text": "Indexical Belief and Indexical Semantics || Direct Reference Theories of Indexicals, Singular Propositions, and Indexical Belief\n4.1 Direct Reference Theories of Indexicals, Singular Propositions, and Indexical Belief\n\nDirect reference theories of indexicals (such as\nKaplan\u2019s) say that the contents of \u2018I\u2019,\n\u2018he\u2019, \u2018she\u2019, \u2018you\u2019,\n\u2018that\u2019, and similar indexicals, in contexts, are the\nindividuals to which those terms refer, in those contexts. Further, the\ncontents (in contexts) of sentences containing such indexicals\nsentences are singular propositions (structured propositions\nthat have individuals as constituents). Thus direct reference theories,\ntogether with the earlier assumptions about the connection of semantics\nwith belief, imply that agents with indexical beliefs believe singular\npropositions. But various examples suggest that there is something\nwrong with, or at least something missing from, theories that say that\nagents with indexical beliefs believe singular propositions. Here is\none famous example of this sort.\n\nThe messy shopper (Perry 1979)\n\n\nJohn is in a grocery store, pushing a shopping cart. At the end of\neach row in the store there is a large mirror mounted near the ceiling.\nJohn notices a reflection of a shopper in one of these mirrors. He\ncannot see the shopper\u2019s face, but he can see that the\nshopper\u2019s cart contains a leaking bag of sugar. John utters\n\u2018He is making a mess\u2019 and sets off to find the messy\nshopper. But in fact, John saw a reflection of himself, and the leaking\nbag of sugar that he saw was in his own cart. After circling the store,\nJohn returns to the spot where he first spotted the messy shopper. He\nencounters the trail of sugar that he left behind. He then says\n\u2018I am making a mess\u2019, stops his cart, and adjusts the\nleaking bag of sugar in his cart.\n\n\nLet \\(t_0\\) be the time at which John first saw the\nmessy shopper and uttered \u2018He is making a mess\u2019. Let\n\\(t_1\\) be the later time at which John uttered \u2018I\nam making a mess\u2019 and stopped pushing his cart. It seems that\nJohn began to believe something at time \\(t_1\\) that he\ndid not believe at \\(t_0\\). One proposition he seemingly\nbegan to believe for the first time at \\(t_1\\) is the\nproposition that the sentence \u2018I am making a mess\u2019\nexpressed in his context at \\(t_1\\). However, according\nto direct reference theories, that sentence expressed, in John\u2019s\ncontext at \\(t_1\\), the singular proposition that John\nis making a mess. But John already believed the proposition that\n\u2018He is making a mess\u2019 expressed in his context at the\nearlier time \\(t_0\\), and he continued to believe\nthat proposition through time \\(t_1\\). If direct\nreference theories are true, that proposition is also the singular\nproposition that John is making a mess. So, direct reference theories\nentail that John already believed, before time \\(t_1\\),\nthe singular proposition that John is making a mess. So, if direct\nreference theories are correct, then it is not the case that John began\nto believe a proposition at \\(t_1\\) that he did not\npreviously believe. But he did. Therefore, direct reference theories of\nindexicals are incorrect.\n\n\nWe can extract a simpler argument against direct reference theories\nfrom the messy shopper example by adding one more element to it.\nConsider the earlier time \\(t_0\\) when John first looked\nin the mirror and uttered \u2018He is making a mess\u2019, and now\nsuppose he also uttered \u2018I am not making a mess\u2019 at that\ntime. Then he believed the propositions expressed by both \u2018He is\nmaking a mess\u2019 and \u2018I am not making a mess\u2019 in his\ncontext at \\(t_0\\). But according to direct reference\ntheories, \u2018He is making a mess\u2019 expresses, in John\u2019s\ncontext at \\(t_0\\), the singular proposition that John\nis making a mess and the sentence \u2018I am not making a mess\u2019\nexpresses, in that same context, the singular proposition that John is\nnot making a mess. So, if direct reference theories are true, then at\n\\(t_0\\), John believed both a proposition and its\nnegation. But John is rational, and no rational person believes a\nproposition and its negation. Therefore, direct reference theories of\nindexicals are incorrect.\n\n\nBoth of the above objections to direct reference theories of\nindexicals can easily be modified to target theories that say that the\ncontents of expressions containing indexicals, in contexts, are merely\nintensions, rather than structured contents.\n\n\nBefore considering replies from direct-reference theorists, let us\nconsider an alternative semantics for indexicals, and an alternative\ntheory of indexical belief, that may avoid the apparent problems with\ndirect-reference theories.\n",
