    "main_text": "Antirealism: Foils for Scientific Realism || Feminist Approaches\n4.5 Pragmatism, Quietism, and Dialectical Paralysis\n\nIt is not uncommon to hear philosophers remark that the dialogue\nbetween the forms of realism and antirealism surveyed in this article\nshows every symptom of a perennial philosophical dispute. The issues\ncontested range so broadly and elicit so many competing intuitions\n(about which, arguably, reasonable people may disagree) that some\nquestion whether a resolution is even possible. This prognosis of\npotentially irresolvable dialectical complexity is relevant to a\nnumber of further views in the philosophy of science, some of which\narise as direct responses to it. For example, Fine ([1986b] 1996: chs.\n7\u20138) argues that ultimately, neither realism nor antirealism is\ntenable, and recommends what he calls the \u201cnatural ontological\nattitude\u201d (NOA) instead (see Rouse 1988, 1991 for detailed\nexplorations of the view). NOA is intended to comprise a neutral,\ncommon core of realist and antirealist attitudes of acceptance of our\nbest theories. The mistake that both parties make, Fine suggests, is\nto add further epistemological and metaphysical diagnoses to this\nshared position, such as pronouncements about which aspects of\nscientific ontology should be viewed as real, which are proper\nsubjects of belief, and so on. Others contend that this sort of\napproach to scientific knowledge is non- or anti-philosophical, and\ndefend philosophical engagement in debates about realism (Crasnow\n2000, Mcarthur 2006). Musgrave (1989) argues that the view is either\nempty or collapses into realism.\n\nThe idea of putting the conflict between realist and antirealist\napproaches to science aside is also a recurring theme in some accounts\nof pragmatism, and quietism. Regarding the first, Peirce ([1992] 1998,\nin \u201cHow to Make Our Ideas Clear\u201d, for instance, originally\npublished in 1878) holds that the content of a proposition should be\nunderstood in terms of (among other things) its \u201cpractical\nconsequences\u201d for human experience, such as implications for\nobservation or problem-solving. For James ([1907] 1979), positive\nutility measured in these terms is the very marker of truth (where\ntruth is whatever will be agreed in the ideal limit of scientific\ninquiry). Many of the points disputed by realists and\nantirealists\u2014differences in epistemic commitment to scientific\nentities based on observability, for example\u2014are effectively\nnon-issues on this view (Almeder 2007; Misak 2010). It is nevertheless\na form of antirealism on traditional readings of Peirce and James,\nsince both suggest that truth in the pragmatist sense exhausts our\nconception of reality, thus running foul of the metaphysical dimension\nof realism. The notion of quietism is often associated with\nWittgenstein\u2019s response to philosophical problems about which,\nhe maintained, nothing sensible can be said. This is not to say that\nengaging with such a problem is not to one\u2019s taste, but rather\nthat quite independently of one\u2019s interest or lack thereof, the\ndispute itself concerns a pseudo-problem. Blackburn (2002) suggests\nthat disputes about realism may have this character.\n\nOne last take on the putative irresolvability of debates concerning\nrealism focuses on certain meta-philosophical commitments adopted by\nthe interlocutors. Wylie (1986: 287), for instance, claims that \n\n\nthe most sophisticated positions on either side now incorporate\nself-justifying conceptions of the aim of philosophy and of the\nstandards of adequacy appropriate for judging philosophical theories\nof science. \n\n\nDifferent assumptions ab initio regarding what sorts of\ninferences are legitimate, what sorts of evidence reasonably support\nbelief, whether there is a genuine demand for the explanation of\nobservable phenomena in terms of underlying realities, and so on, may\nrender some arguments between realists and antirealists\nquestion-begging. This diagnosis is arguably facilitated by van\nFraassen\u2019s (1989: 170\u2013176, 1994: 182) intimation that\nneither realism nor antirealism (in his case, empiricism) is ruled out\nby plausible canons of rationality; each is sustained by a different\nconception of how much epistemic risk one should take in forming\nbeliefs on the basis of one\u2019s evidence. An intriguing question\nthen emerges as to whether disputes surrounding realism and\nantirealism are resolvable in principle, or whether, ultimately,\ninternally consistent and coherent formulations of these positions\nshould be regarded as irreconcilable but nonetheless permissible\ninterpretations of scientific knowledge (Chakravartty 2017; Forbes forthcoming).\n",
