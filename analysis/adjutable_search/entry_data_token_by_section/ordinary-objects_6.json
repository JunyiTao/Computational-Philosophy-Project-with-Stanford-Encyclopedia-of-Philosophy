    "main_text": "Against Conservative Ontologies || Arbitrariness Arguments\n2.5 Arbitrariness Arguments\n\nArguments from arbitrariness turn on the observation that there would\nseem to be no ontologically significant difference between certain\nordinary and extraordinary objects, that is, no difference between\nthem that can account for why there would be things of the one kind\nbut not the other. Here is an example (drawn from Hawthorne 2006:\nvii):\n\n(AR1)\nThere are islands.\n(AR2)\nThere is no ontologically significant difference between islands\nand incars.\n(AR3)\nIf there is no ontologically significant difference between\nislands and incars, then: if there are islands then there are\nincars.\n(AR4)\nSo, there are incars.\n\n\nThe idea behind AR2 is that islands and incars (see\n \u00a71.3)\n would seem to be objects of broadly the same sort, namely, objects\nthat go out of existence simply by virtue of changing their\norientation with respect to some other thing (the water level in the\none case, the garage in the other), without their constitutive matter\nundergoing any intrinsic change. The idea behind AR3 is that, if there\ntruly are islands but no incars, then this is something that would\nseem to stand in need of explanation: there would have to be something\nin virtue of which it\u2019s the case. To think otherwise would be to\ntake the facts about what exists to be arbitrary in a way that they\nplausibly are not.\n\nSimilar arguments may be used to establish the existence of leg\ncomplements (on the grounds that there\u2019s no ontologically\nsignificant difference between them and legs) and trout-turkeys (on\nthe grounds that there\u2019s no ontologically significant difference\nbetween them and scattered objects like solar\n systems).[34]\n\n\nEliminativists may of course resist the argument by denying\n AR1.[35]\n\n\nThe argument may also be resisted by denying AR2 and identifying some\nontologically significant difference between islands and incars. For\ninstance, a certain sort of anti-realist will say that which objects\nthere are is largely determined by which objects we take there to be.\nAccordingly, the very fact that we take there to be islands but not\nincars marks an ontologically significant difference between them.\nAlternatively, one may attempt to identify an ontologically\nsignificant difference between the ordinary and extraordinary objects\nwithout endorsing anti-realism. In the case at hand, one might resist\nAR2 by insisting that islands have importantly different persistence\nconditions from incars. Incars are meant to cease to exist when their\nmatter ceases to be inside a garage. But islands, contra hypothesis,\ndo not cease to exist when they are completely submerged; they merely\ncease to be\n islands.[36]\n\nHow about AR3? Part of why it seems arbitrary to countenance islands\nbut not incars is that one would seem to be privileging islands over\nincars by virtue of taking them to exist. For this reason, proponents\nof certain deflationary ontological views are well positioned to deny\nAR3. Relativists, for instance, may maintain that islands exist and\nincars do not exist\u2014relative to our conceptual scheme, that is.\nRelative to other, equally good schemes, incars exist and islands do\nnot. Quantifier variantists, who maintain that there are counterparts\nof our quantifiers that are on a par with ours and that range over\nthings that do not exist\u2014but rather exist*\u2014may maintain\nthat islands exist but do not exist* while incars exist* but do not\nexist. On such views, islands and incars receive a uniform treatment\nat bottom; islands are not getting any sort of \u201cspecial\ntreatment\u201d that cries out for\n explanation.[37]\n\n",
