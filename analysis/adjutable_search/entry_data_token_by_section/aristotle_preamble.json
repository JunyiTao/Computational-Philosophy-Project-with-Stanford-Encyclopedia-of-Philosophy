    "main_text": "\n\n\nAristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.) numbers among the greatest\nphilosophers of all time. Judged solely in terms of his philosophical\ninfluence, only Plato is his peer: Aristotle\u2019s works shaped centuries\nof philosophy from Late Antiquity through the Renaissance, and even\ntoday continue to be studied with keen, non-antiquarian interest. A\nprodigious researcher and writer, Aristotle left a great body of work,\nperhaps numbering as many as two-hundred treatises, from which\napproximately thirty-one\n survive.[1] \n His extant writings span a wide range of\ndisciplines, from logic, metaphysics and philosophy of mind, through\nethics, political theory, aesthetics and rhetoric, and into such\nprimarily non-philosophical fields as empirical biology, where he\nexcelled at detailed plant and animal observation and description. \nIn all these areas, Aristotle\u2019s theories have provided\nillumination, met with resistance, sparked debate, and generally\nstimulated the sustained interest of an abiding readership.\n\n\nBecause of its wide range and its remoteness in time,\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy defies easy encapsulation. The long\nhistory of interpretation and appropriation of Aristotelian texts and\nthemes\u2014spanning over two millennia and comprising philosophers\nworking within a variety of religious and secular traditions\u2014has\nrendered even basic points of interpretation controversial. The\nset of entries on Aristotle in this site addresses this situation by\nproceeding in three tiers. First, the present, general entry\noffers a brief account of Aristotle\u2019s life and characterizes his\ncentral philosophical commitments, highlighting his most distinctive\nmethods and most influential\n achievements.[2] \n Second are General Topics, which offer detailed introductions\nto the main areas of Aristotle\u2019s philosophical activity. Finally,\nthere follow Special Topics, which investigate in greater\ndetail more narrowly focused issues, especially those of central\nconcern in recent Aristotelian scholarship. \n",
