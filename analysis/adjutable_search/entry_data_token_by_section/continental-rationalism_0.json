Introduction: Rationalism and Substance\n\n\nThe seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries saw the heyday of\nmetaphysical system-building, but the expression\n\u201ccontinental rationalism\u201d primarily connotes rather a set\nof epistemological views. By contrast to British empiricism,\nwhich traces all knowledge to sensory experience, these views\nemphasize a reliance on reason (ratio in Latin, hence\nrationalism), the resources of which are taken to be sufficient in\nsome sense for what we know. Thus, a signature doctrine of rationalism\nis the doctrine of innate ideas, according to which the mind has built\ninto it not just the structure of knowledge but even its\ncontent. Nonetheless, among the philosophers comprising the extension\nof the expression, metaphysical issues, particularly the ontology of\nsubstance, occupy the central place. Certainly, this is true of\nLeibniz and Spinoza, but also of Malebranche and other Cartesians, and\neven of Descartes on some plausible understandings of him.\n\n\nTo understand the relationship between rationalism\u2019s\nmetaphysical and epistemological commitments, it is helpful to recall\nPlato\u2019s divided line, which establishes a parallel between\nobjects known and the means by which they are known. In fact, the\norder of objects, the ordo essendi ranging in importance down\nfrom the Good to other forms, to individual things, and to images, and\nthe order of knowing, the ordo cognoscendi, ranging from\nintuition of various sorts down to sensory experience, is itself to be\nfound in various versions among the later rationalists. The important\npoint, in any case, is that, for the continental rationalists as for\nPlato, the epistemological distinctions are grounded in ontological\ndistinctions. Or, to put it in terms that reflect rationalist thinking\non a number of issues, there is only a distinction of reason between\nthe two orders. The orders of being and knowing are not really\ndistinct; they differ only in our ways of thinking about them.\n\n\nThere is a good explanation of the close connection seen by the\nrationalists between the epistemological and ontological orders, one\nthat also accounts for their notable reliance on reason. It derives\nfrom their answer to what Leibniz called the grand metaphysical\nquestion: why is there something rather than nothing at all? There is\nsomething because there must be something; there cannot be nothing (and\nthis way of putting it shows the ultimate debt of the rationalists to a\ntradition that goes back to Parmenides). Reality, or at least some part\nof it, has necessary existence, and that necessity is something like\nlogical necessity. With this answer, a whole philosophical outlook\nfalls into place. First of all, any significant role for sensory\nexperience falls away, since what exists can be known a priori\nby logic alone. Causal connections tend to be viewed as logical\nconnections; a principle of sufficient reason falls out which tends to\nbe read as a matter of logical deduction. One result is that there is\nan impulse toward monism: if the ultimate cause must exist, then that\nfor which it is the sufficient reason must also exist, and just how the\ntwo can be distinguished becomes problematic (again, the Parmenidean\nantecedent is clear).\n\n\nThis outlook was not articulated as such by any rationalist except,\nperhaps, Spinoza\u2014indeed most were concerned to avoid such\nconsequences of their views. But the outlook does capture the\nintuitions behind the metaphysical systems they elaborated. And it\ncertainly draws the contrast between them and the empiricists, who\ntended toward tychism, the view that the world is largely, or\neven entirely, a product of chance. On the empiricist account, the\nuniverse consists of many independent individuals, which, if they are\nconnected, are so only accidentally, reducing causation to nothing\nmore than a matter of constant conjunction. (This physical,\nmetaphysical, and logical atomism is in the tradition of Democritus,\nEpicurus, and Lucretius.) Under such circumstances, only experience of\nthe world can provide knowledge of it.\n\n\nThe early modern period of philosophy, including continental\nrationalism, is generally supposed to have been driven by the new\nscience to a radical departure from the Aristotelianism of the late\nmedieval or renaissance period immediately preceding it. (But see\nGoldstone\u2019s 1998 problematization of the very idea of early\nmodernity, and of the view that the period was launched by the New\nScience.) The mechanization and mathematization of the world demanded\nby the inertial physics of a moving Earth led to a revolutionary\nphilosophy better described, at least in its rationalist version, as\nPlatonic, or even Pythagorean. Even so, Aristotelian concepts and\nterminology persisted. Both were appropriated and deployed to deal\nwith the new problems. The principal Aristotelian concept taken over\nby the rationalists was the concept of substance.\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s term ousia is usually translated as\n\u201csubstance\u201d. What exactly Aristotle meant by the term is a\nthorny matter, much debated in the literature. His account of\nsubstance in the Categories holds individual things, which he\nterms \u201cproper substances\u201d, to be paradigmatic of\nsubstance. On this account, substance is best understood by analogy\nwith a grammatical subject\u2014it takes a predicate, and is not\npredicable of anything further. Thus, while animal is predicable of\nhorse, and horse of Bucephalus, Bucephalus stands by himself,\nimpredicable of, and hence, numerically different from anything\nelse. Much of Aristotle\u2019s account in\nthe Metaphysics\u2014written years later\u2014seems to\naccord with this. However, Metaphysics (1017b10\u201326)\ncomplicates the story. Aristotle there describes four uses of the\nterm. He concludes by reducing these to two broad senses\u2014(1)\nsubstance as hypokeimenon, the ultimate substratum, which is\nnot predicated of anything further; and (2) substance as form\u2014\nthat which makes each thing the kind of thing that it is. Indications\nwithin the text suggest that, by the time that he was giving the\nlectures that are collected in the\nMetaphysics, Aristotle regarded not individual things but the\nmatter of which these individual things are formed as the ultimate\nsubject of predication. On this conception, there is some sense in\nwhich Bucephalus is himself predicable of matter. Thus, while the\nsubstance of the Categories serves as a principle of\nindividuation, the substance of the Metaphysics is more\ncomplicated, serving both to individuate Bucephalus and Seabiscuit and\nto capture the connection or sameness that holds between them.\n\n\nThat substance should be called upon to account for both difference\nand sameness in the world indicates an inherent tension in the\nconcept.  Certainly, the two senses of the term\n\u2018substance\u2019 were in tension during the seventeenth\ncentury. The momentum of rationalist argument was to resolve the\ntension by folding the first sense into the second: there is no real\ndifferentiation in the world, only the appearance of\ndifference. Seventeenth century rationalists assigned to substance\nthree roles of connection. Substance was taken (1) to connect\nattributes as attributes of the same thing at a time (a given\nshape and a given size as the shape and size of the same thing), (2)\nto connect them over time (the later shape and size, perhaps\ndifferent from the earlier, as nonetheless the shape and size of the\nvery same thing), and (3) to connect them as somehow related to the\nthing as a certain kind of thing (for the Cartesians, shape and size\nwould indicate the thing to be of the kind \u201cextended\u201d).\nHowever, Spinoza alone among the continental rationalists fully\nembraced the conception of substance as a fundamental connection\nbetween things. The other members of the movement struggled to retain\na notion of substance as individuator, but did so with varying degrees\nof success.\n",
