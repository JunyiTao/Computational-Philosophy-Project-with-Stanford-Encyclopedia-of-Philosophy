    "main_text": "Conceptions of Narrow Content || Sets of Maximal Epistemic Possibilities\n4.5 Sets of Maximal Epistemic Possibilities\n\nA final view about the nature of narrow content has some striking\nstructural resemblances to the idea of a diagonal proposition, but is\nmotivated very differently. This is the view of David Chalmers (1996,\n2002); a related view has been defended by David Lewis (1979, 1994).\nIn a nutshell, the view construes narrow contents as sets of maximal\nepistemic possibilities, or scenarios. (Scenarios closely\nresemble the centered worlds used to define diagonal propositions.\nWhether there is a centered world for every scenario, and vice versa,\nare debated issues: see Chalmers 2006, section 3.4.) The motivation\nfor this view requires some development.\n\nNarrow content is intended to capture a subject\u2019s perspective on\nthe world, the way the world is according to the subject. A very\nnatural way to think of this is to consider the narrow content of a\nbelief or other thought to be a way of dividing up the ways things\ncould conceivably be into those that are compatible with the thought\nand those that are ruled out by it.\n\nOf course, broad contents also produce a kind of partitioning\nof possibilities. Any sort of content that determines truth\nconditions will rule in some possibilities and rule out others. But\nbroad content does not provide the kind of partitioning needed for\nnarrow content. Twin Earth is ruled out by the broad content of my\nbelief that the lakes are full of water, since the lakes on Twin Earth\ndo not contain water. But narrow content was introduced precisely in\norder to have a kind of content that my Twin and I share, so the\nnarrow content of my thought that the lakes contain water should come\nout true in a Twin Earth environment centered on my Twin, just as my\nTwin\u2019s parallel thought comes out true there. A related way to\nsee why Twin Earth is not ruled out by the narrow content of my\nthought is to notice that I can imagine finding out that all the\nwatery stuff in my actual environment is XYZ. In that case I\nwould not conclude that the lakes do not contain water; instead I\nwould conclude that water is XYZ. So the narrow content of my thought\nthat the lakes contain water does not rule out Twin Earth, even though\nits broad content does.\n\nChalmers develops this line of thought with the help of the following\napparatus. A thought is said to be epistemically possible if\nit cannot be ruled out a priori, i.e. if its negation cannot be\nconclusively established without any appeal to experience. Such a\nthought corresponds to an epistemic possibility, a way the world could\nbe for all one can tell a priori. A scenario is then defined\nto be a maximally specific epistemic possibility, an epistemic\npossibility with no detail left unspecified. Epistemic space\nis the set of all such scenarios. Any thought carves out a particular\nregion of epistemic space by endorsing some scenarios and\nexcluding others. A thought endorses a scenario when, if we\naccept that the scenario is actual, we should accept the thought as\ntrue. For instance, if we accept as actual a scenario in which the\nliquid that falls from the skies and fills the lakes is XYZ, we should\naccept as true the thought that water is XYZ. We can then think of the\nnarrow content of a thought as constituted by the way the thought\ndivides epistemic space into those scenarios it endorses and those it\nexcludes. More specifically, we can think of the narrow content of a\nthought as a function from scenarios to truth values, or (equivalently\nif we have only two truth values) simply as a set of scenarios, namely\nthose endorsed by the thought. (This paragraph closely follows\nChalmers 2002, p. 610. Chalmers gives related but somewhat more\ndetailed expositions in Chalmers 2003, especially pp. 47, 54, and in\nChalmers 2006, especially pp. 76ff. Note that a thought endorses a\nscenario iff the scenario verifies the thought: Chalmers 2006 uses the\nlatter terminology but not the former.)\n\nScenarios clearly have much in common with centered worlds. Indeed, it\nmay be possible to simply identify scenarios with centered worlds.\n(Chalmers is cautious about this, noting reasons that some might\nreject this identification, but makes use of it for some purposes.) If\nscenarios are thought of as centered worlds, then the idea that narrow\ncontent is a function from scenarios to truth values is obviously a\nclose cousin of the idea that narrow contents are diagonal\npropositions, which can also be thought of as functions from centered\nworlds to truth values. The differences between the two accounts\nshould not be underestimated, however. An immediate formal difference\nis that narrow contents on Chalmers\u2019 approach are defined over a\nlarger class of centered worlds than are diagonal propositions. On the\ndiagonal approach, the centered worlds with respect to which a thought\nis evaluated must include a token of that very thought at the center,\nwhile this is not the case on the approach we are now considering.\nAnother substantive difference between the two views is that they lead\nto very different strategies for determining narrow contents, as will\nemerge in sections 5.1 and 5.4.\n",
