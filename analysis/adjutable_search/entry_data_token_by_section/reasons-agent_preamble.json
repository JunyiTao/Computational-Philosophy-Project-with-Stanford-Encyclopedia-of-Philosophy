    "main_text": "\n\nThe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction is widely and rightly\nregarded as a philosophically important one. Unfortunately, the\ndistinction is often drawn in different and mutually incompatible\nways. The agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction has historically\nbeen drawn three main ways: the \u2018principle-based\ndistinction\u2019, the \u2018reason-statement-based\ndistinction\u2019 and the \u2018perspective-based\ndistinction\u2019. Each of these approaches has its own distinctive\nvices (Sections 1\u20133). However, a slightly modified version of\nthe historically influential principle-based approach seems to avoid\nmost if not all of these vices (Section 4). The distinction so\nunderstood differs from numerous other distinctions with which it\nmight easily be confused (Section 5). Finally, the distinction so\ndrawn is important to normative theorizing for a variety of reasons\n(Section 6).\n",
