    "main_text": "Arguments for Disjunctivism || An Argument from Demonstrative Reference\n3.5 An Argument from Demonstrative Reference\n John Campbell (2002a, 2002b, 2005, 2011) has argued that there is\nan important connection between the nature of the conscious perceptual\nexperience that occurs when we veridically perceive the world and our\nability to think demonstratively about the mind-independent objects\nthat we perceive. He argues that only a \u2018relational view of\nexperience\u2019 can adequately acknowledge the role of conscious\nexperience in making it possible for us to think demonstratively about\nthe categorical properties of the mind-independent objects we\nperceive, and this relational view of experience commits him to a form\nof disjunctivism about perception.\n\n\nAccording to this relational view of experience, when you veridically\nperceive the world the mind-independent objects and properties you\nperceive are constituents of your conscious experience\u2014the\nqualitative character of the conscious experience you undergo is\nconstituted by the qualitative characters of the mind-independent\nitems you perceive. This kind of experience cannot occur when you\nhallucinate\u2014veridical perceptions and hallucinations are\nexperiences of different conscious kinds\u2014hence the commitment to\ndisjunctivism. More precisely, according to the relational view of\nexperience that Campbell endorses, we are not to think of perceptual\nconsciousness of an object as a two-place relation between a person\nand an object, but rather as a three-place relation between a person,\na standpoint, and an object. Campbell suggests that we need\nto factor in the notion of a \u2018standpoint\u2019 as our\nexperience of objects is always in some sense partial. You always\nexperience an object from a standpoint, and you can experience one and\nthe same object from different standpoints. (For a similar proposal,\nsee Brewer 2011 and 2017a. For further discussion of this aspect of\nna\u00efve realism, see French 2018 and Christy 2019).\n\n\nCampbell argues that an adequate account of the nature of our\nconscious experience of objects should accommodate the fact that such\nconscious experience performs a significant explanatory role. According\nto Campbell, such conscious experience provides us with knowledge of\nwhat our perceptual demonstrative terms, like \u2018this\u2019 and\n\u2018that\u2019, refer to. Furthermore, according to Campbell, the\nknowledge of the semantic value of the demonstrative that such\nconscious experience provides us with, justifies and causes the pattern\nof use we make of that demonstrative in our reasoning. The relevant\npatterns of reasoning we engage in reflect our conception of the object\nreferred to as mind-independent. So, Campbell argues, our conscious\nexperience of objects has a role to play in explaining what provides us\nwith our conception of the objects of perception as mind-independent.\nCampbell argues that it is only the relational view of experience that\ncan adequately acknowledge the way in which conscious experience plays\nthis explanatory role, so competing accounts of experience should be\nrejected.\n\n\nNote that the explanatory role that Campbell is suggesting that our\nconscious experience of objects is supposed to play isn\u2019t simply that\nof justifying, or providing warrant for, our beliefs and judgements\nthat employ perceptual demonstratives. His claim is rather that such\nexperience has a role to play in justifying the patterns of use we\nmake of the demonstrative in reasoning that we engage in\u2014where\nsuch reasoning reflects our grasp of the criteria of identity of the\nobject referred to, which in turn reflects our grasp of the object as\nbeing mind-independent. According to Campbell, this pattern of use is\njustified by appeal to the semantic value of the demonstrative. Our\nconscious experience of the object to which the demonstrative refers\nprovides us with a form of knowledge of the semantic value of the\ndemonstrative, and thereby plays a role in justifying the use we make\nof the demonstrative in our reasoning.\n\n\nCampbell argues that one cannot adequately acknowledge the way in\nwhich conscious experience plays this explanatory role if one holds a\nview of experience according to which an experience is a mental state\nor event with an intentional content that represents the world as\nbeing a certain way. For such a view of experience at best presupposes\nwhat is to be explained. It presupposes what is to be explained if the\ncontent of such a representational state is conceptual, and it doesn\u2019t\nhave the resources to play the relevant explanatory role if its\nrepresentational content is non-conceptual. What\u2019s required, argues\nCampbell, is a conception of experience as something less than\nconceptual representation of the object of experience, but which\nnonetheless has the resources to explain how experience of an object\ncan provide one with a form of knowledge of the semantic value of a\ndemonstrative that refers to it. Campbell argues that the only\nadequate contender is the relational view, for according to the\nrelational view one\u2019s conscious experience in the veridical case\nacquaints one with a mind-independent object and its\ncategorical properties. This confrontation with, this awareness\nof, the mind-independent object referred to is what provides\none with the relevant form of knowledge of the semantic value of the\ndemonstrative that allows experience to play its explanatory role.\n\n\nAs Campbell himself points out, his argument presses very hard the\nidea that experience of objects has this explanatory role to play. Some\nissues of contention here are the following: (a) Whether an account of\nthe nature of conscious experience really does have a role to play when\nit comes to an explanation of the fact that we have a conception of\nobjects in the world as mind-independent. (b) If the nature of\nconscious experience does have such an explanatory role to play,\nwhether it is the one that Campbell identifies\u2014i.e., that of\ncausing and justifying the use we make of demonstrative terms that\nrefer to the mind-independent objects we perceive. (c) Whether the\nrelational view of experience really does have the resources to play\nthe explanatory role that Campbell assigns to it. (For criticism of\nCampbell\u2019s argument, see Burge 2005, Rey 2005, and Cassam 2011).\n",
