    "main_text": "Neural networks\n4. Neural networks\n In the 1980s, connectionism emerged as a prominent rival to\nclassical computationalism. Connectionists draw inspiration from\nneurophysiology rather than logic and computer science. They employ\ncomputational models, neural networks, that differ\nsignificantly from Turing-style models. A neural network is a\ncollection of interconnected nodes. Nodes fall into three\ncategories: input nodes, output nodes,\nand hidden nodes (which mediate between input and output\nnodes). Nodes have activation values, given by real numbers. One node\ncan bear a weighted connection to another node, also given by\na real number. Activations of input nodes are determined exogenously:\nthese are the inputs to computation.  Total input activation\nof a hidden or output node is a weighted sum of the activations of\nnodes feeding into it. Activation of a hidden or output node is a\nfunction of its total input activation; the particular function varies\nwith the network. During neural network computation, waves of\nactivation propagate from input nodes to output nodes, as determined\nby weighted connections between nodes.\nIn a feedforward network, weighted connections flow only\nin one direction. Recurrent networks have feedback loops, in\nwhich connections emanating from hidden units circle back to hidden\nunits. Recurrent networks are less mathematically tractable than\nfeedforward networks. However, they figure crucially in psychological\nmodeling of various phenomena, such as phenomena that involve some\nkind of memory (Elman 1990).\nWeights in a neural network are typically mutable, evolving in\naccord with a learning algorithm. The literature offers\nvarious learning algorithms, but the basic idea is usually to adjust\nweights so that actual outputs gradually move closer to\nthe target outputs one would expect for the relevant\ninputs. The backpropagation algorithm is a widely used\nalgorithm of this kind (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986).\nConnectionism traces back to McCulloch and Pitts (1943), who\nstudied networks of interconnected logic gates (e.g.,\nAND-gates and OR-gates). One can view a network of logic gates as a\nneural network, with activations confined to two values (0 and 1) and\nactivation functions given by the usual truth-functions. McCulloch and\nPitts advanced logic gates as idealized models of individual\nneurons. Their discussion exerted a profound influence on computer\nscience (von Neumann 1945). Modern digital computers are simply\nnetworks of logic gates. Within cognitive science, however,\nresearchers usually focus upon networks whose elements are more\n\u201cneuron-like\u201d than logic gates. In particular, modern-day\nconnectionists typically emphasize analog neural networks whose nodes\ntake continuous rather than discrete activation values. Some authors\neven use the phrase \u201cneural network\u201d so that it\nexclusively denotes such networks.\nNeural networks received relatively scant attention from cognitive\nscientists during the 1960s and 1970s, when Turing-style models\ndominated. The 1980s witnessed a huge resurgence of interest in neural\nnetworks, especially analog neural networks, with the\ntwo-volume Parallel Distributed Processing (Rumelhart, McClelland, and the PDP research group, 1986; McClelland, Rumelhart, and the PDP research group, 1987) serving as a\nmanifesto.  Researchers constructed connectionist models of diverse\nphenomena: object recognition, speech perception, sentence\ncomprehension, cognitive development, and so on. Impressed by\nconnectionism, many researchers concluded that CCTM+RTM was no longer\n\u201cthe only game in town\u201d.\n\nIn the 2010s, a class of computational models known as deep neural\nnetworks became quite popular (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton\n2012; LeCun, Bengio, and Hinton 2015). These models are neural\nnetworks with multiple layers of hidden nodes (sometimes hundreds of\nsuch layers). Deep neural networks\u2014trained on large data sets\nthrough one or another learning algorithm (usually\nbackpropagation)\u2014have achieved great success in many areas of\nAI, including object recognition and strategic game-playing. Deep\nneural networks are now widely deployed in commercial applications,\nand they are the focus of extensive ongoing investigation within both\nacademia and industry. Researchers have also begun using them to model\nthe mind (e.g. Marblestone, Wayne, and Kording 2016; Kriegeskorte\n2015).\n\nFor a detailed overview of neural networks, see Haykin (2008). For a\nuser-friendly introduction, with an emphasis on psychological\napplications, see Marcus (2001). For a philosophically oriented\nintroduction to deep neural networks, see Buckner (2019).\n",
