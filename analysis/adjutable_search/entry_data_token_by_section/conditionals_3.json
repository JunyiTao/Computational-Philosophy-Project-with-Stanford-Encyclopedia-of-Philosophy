    "main_text": "Truth Conditions for Indicative Conditionals || Arguments Against Truth-Functionality\n2.3 Arguments Against Truth-Functionality\n\nThe best-known objection to the truth-functional account, one of the\n\u201cparadoxes of material implication\u201d, is that according to\nHook, the falsity of \\(A\\) is sufficient for the truth of \u201cIf\n\\(A, B\\)\u201d. Look at the last two lines of column (i). In every\npossible situation in which \\(A\\) is false, \u201c\\(A \\supset\nB\\)\u201d is true. Can it be right that the falsity of \u201cShe\ntouched the wire\u201d entails the truth of \u201cIf she touched the\nwire she got a shock\u201d? \n\nHook might respond as follows. How do we test our intuitions about the\nvalidity of an inference? The direct way is to imagine that we know\nfor sure that the premise is true, and to consider what we would then\nthink about the conclusion. Now when we know for sure that\n\\({\\sim}A\\), we have no use for thoughts beginning \u201cIf \\(A\\),\n\u2026\u201d. When you know for sure that Harry didn\u2019t do it,\nyou don\u2019t go in for \u201cIf Harry did it \u2026\u201d\nthoughts or remarks. In this circumstance conditionals have no role to\nplay, and we have no practice in assessing them. The direct intuitive\ntest is, therefore, silent on whether \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d\nfollows from \\({\\sim}A\\). If our smoothest, simplest, generally\nsatisfactory theory has the consequence that it does follow, perhaps\nwe should learn to live with that consequence.\n\nThere may, of course, be further consequences of this feature of\nHook\u2019s theory which jar with intuition. That needs\ninvestigating. But, Hook may add, even if we come to the conclusion\nthat \u201c\\(\\supset\\)\u201d does not match perfectly our\nnatural-language \u201cif\u201d, it comes close, and it has the\nvirtues of simplicity and clarity. We have seen that rival theories\nalso have counterintuitive consequences. Natural language is a fluid\naffair, and we cannot expect our theories to achieve better than\napproximate fit. Perhaps, in the interests of precision and clarity,\nin serious reasoning we should replace the elusive \u201cif\u201d\nwith its neat, close relative, \\(\\supset\\) .\n\nThis was no doubt Frege\u2019s attitude. Frege\u2019s primary\nconcern was to construct a system of logic, formulated in an idealized\nlanguage, which was adequate for mathematical reasoning. If \u201c\\(A\n\\supset B\\)\u201d doesn\u2019t translate perfectly our\nnatural-language \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d, but plays its intended\nrole, so much the worse for natural language.\n\nFor the purpose of doing mathematics, Frege\u2019s judgement was\nprobably correct. The main defects of \\(\\supset\\) don\u2019t show up\nin mathematics. There are some peculiarities, but as long as we are\naware of them, they can be lived with. And arguably, the gain in\nsimplicity and clarity more than offsets the oddities.\n\nThe oddities are harder to tolerate when we consider conditional\njudgements about empirical matters. The difference is this: in\nthinking about the empirical world, we often accept and reject\npropositions with degrees of confidence less than certainty. \u201cI\nthink, but am not sure, that \\(A\\)\u201d plays no central role in\nmathematical thinking. We can, perhaps, ignore as unimportant the use\nof indicative conditionals in circumstances in which we are\ncertain that the antecedent is false. But we cannot ignore\nour use of conditionals whose antecedent we think is likely to be\nfalse. We use them often, accepting some, rejecting others. \u201cI\nthink I won\u2019t need to get in touch, but if I do, I shall need a\nphone number\u201d, you say as your partner is about to go away; not\n\u201cIf I do I\u2019ll manage by telepathy\u201d. \u201cI think\nJohn spoke to Mary; if he didn\u2019t he wrote to her\u201d; not\n\u201cIf he didn\u2019t he shot her\u201d. Hook\u2019s theory has\nthe unhappy consequence that all conditionals with unlikely\nantecedents are likely to be true. To think it likely that \\({\\sim}A\\)\nis to think it likely that a sufficient condition for the truth of\n\u201c\\(A \\supset B\\)\u201d obtains. Take someone who thinks that\nthe Republicans won\u2019t win the election \\(({\\sim}R)\\), and who\nrejects the thought that if they do win, they will double income tax\n\\((D)\\). According to Hook, this person has grossly inconsistent\nopinions. For if she thinks it\u2019s likely that \\({\\sim}R\\), she\nmust think it likely that at least one of the propositions,\n\\(\\{{\\sim}R, D\\}\\) is true. But that is just to think it likely that\n\\(R \\supset D\\). (Put the other way round, to reject \\(R \\supset D\\)\nis to accept \\(R \\amp{\\sim}D\\); for this is the only case in which \\(R\n\\supset D\\) is false. How can someone accept \\(R \\amp{\\sim}D\\) yet\nreject \\(R\\)?) Not only does Hook\u2019s theory fit badly the\npatterns of thought of competent, intelligent people. It cannot be\nclaimed that we would be better off with \\(\\supset\\). On the contrary,\nwe would be intellectually disabled: we would not have the power to\ndiscriminate between believable and unbelievable conditionals whose\nantecedent we think is likely to be false.\n\nArrow does not have this problem. Her theory is designed to avoid it,\nby allowing that \u201c\\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\u201d may be false when\n\\(A\\) is false.\n\nThe other paradox of material implication is that according to Hook\nall conditionals with true consequents are true: from \\(B\\) it follows\nthat \\(A \\supset B\\). This is perhaps less obviously unacceptable: if\nI\u2019m sure that \\(B\\), and treat \\(A\\) as an epistemic\npossibility, I must be sure that if \\(A, B\\). Again the problem\nbecomes vivid when we consider the case when I\u2019m only nearly\nsure, but not quite sure, that \\(B\\). I think \\(B\\) may be\nfalse, and will be false if certain, in my view unlikely,\ncircumstances obtain. For example, I think Sue is giving a lecture\nright now. I don\u2019t think that if she was seriously injured on\nher way to work, she is giving a lecture right now. I reject that\nconditional. But on Hook\u2019s account, the conditional is false\nonly if the consequent is false. I think the consequent is true: I\nthink a sufficient condition for the truth of the conditional\nobtains.\n",
