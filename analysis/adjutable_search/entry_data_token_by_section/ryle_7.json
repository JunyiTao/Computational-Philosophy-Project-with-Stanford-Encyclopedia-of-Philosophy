    "main_text": "Behaviourism\n8. Behaviourism\n\nRyle\u2019s view is standardly characterised as a weaker or\n\u201csofter\u201d version of this doctrine (Smith and Jones, 144).\nAccording to this standard interpretation, Ryle\u2019s view is that\nstatements containing mental terms can be translated, without loss of\nmeaning, into subjunctive conditionals about what the individual will\ndo in various circumstances. So Ryle (on this account) is to be\nconstrued as offering a dispositional analysis of mental statements\ninto behavioural ones. It is conceded that Ryle does not confine his\ndescriptions of what the agent will do (under the circumstances) to\npurely physical behaviour\u2014in terms, say, of skeletal or muscular\ndescriptions\u2014but is happy to speak of full-bodied actions like\nscoring a goal or paying a\n debt.[10]\n But the \u201csoft\u201d behaviourism attributed to Ryle still\nattempts an analysis (or translation) of mental statements into a\nseries of dispositional statements which are themselves construed as\nsubjunctive conditionals describing what the agent will do (albeit\nunder the relevant action description) under various circumstances.\nEven this \u201csoft\u201d behaviourism is bound to fail, however,\nsince mentalistic vocabulary is not analysable or translatable into\nbehavioural statements even if these are allowed to include\ndescriptions of actions. For the list of conditions and possible\nbehaviour will be infinite since any one proffered translation can be\ndefeated by slight alteration of the circumstances; and the defeating\nconditions in any particular case may involve a reference to facts\nabout the agent\u2019s mind, thereby rendering the analysis circular.\nIn sum, the standard interpretation of Ryle construes him as offering\na somewhat weakened form of reductive behaviourism whose reductivist\nambitions, however weakened, are nonetheless futile.\n\nBut this characterisation of Ryle\u2019s programme is wrong. Although\nit is true that Ryle was keen to point out the dispositional nature of\nmany mental concepts, it would be wrong to construe him as offering a\nprogramme of analysis of mental predicates into a series of\nsubjunctive conditionals. The relationship between mental predicates\nand the \u201chypothetical\u201d and \u201csemi-hypothetical\u201d\nsentences with which we can \u201cunpack\u201d them is other than\nthat required by this kind of analysis.\n\nIt will be helpful to keep in mind that Ryle\u2019s target is the\nOfficial Doctrine with its attendant ontological, epistemological, and\nsemantic commitments. His arguments serve to remind us that we have in\na large number of cases ways of telling or settling disputes, for\nexample, about someone\u2019s character or intellect. If you dispute\nmy characterisation of someone as believing or wanting something, I\nwill point to what he says and does in defending my particular\nattribution (as well as to features of the circumstances). But our\npractice of giving reasons of this kind to defend or to challenge\nascriptions of mental predicates would be put under substantial\npressure if the Official Doctrine were correct.\n\nFor Ryle to remind us that we do, as a matter of fact, have a way of\nsettling disputes about whether someone is vain or whether she is in\npain is much weaker than saying that a concept is meaningless unless\nit is verifiable; or even that the successful application of mental\npredicates requires that we have a way of settling disputes in all\ncases. Showing that a concept is one for which, in a large number of\ncases, we have agreement-reaching procedures (even if these do not\nalways guarantee success) captures an important point, however: it\ncounts against any theory, say, of vanity or pain that would render it\nunknowable in principle or in practice whether or not the\nconcept is correctly applied in every case. And this was precisely the\nproblem with the Official Doctrine (and is still a problem, as I\nsuggested earlier, with some of its contemporary progeny).\n\nRyle points out in a later essay that there is a form of dilemma that\npits the reductionist against the\n duplicationist[11]:\n those whose battle cry is \u201cNothing but \u2026\u201d and those\nwho insist on \u201cSomething else as Well \u2026\u201d. Ryle\nattempts a dissolution of these types of dilemma by rejecting the two\nhorns; not by taking sides with either one, though part of what\ndissolution requires in this case, as in others, is a description of\nhow both sides are to be commended for seeing what the other side does\nnot, and criticised for failing to see what the other side does.\n\nThe attraction of behaviourism, he reminds us, is simply that it does\nnot insist on occult happenings as the basis upon which all mental\nterms are given meaning, and points to the perfectly observable\ncriteria that are by and large employed when we are called upon to\ndefend or correct our employment of these mental terms. The problem\nwith behaviourism is that it has a too-narrow view both of what counts\nas behaviour and of what counts as observable. The attraction of\nCartesianism is that it recognizes in a way the behaviourist does not\nthat there may be crucial differences between creatures who\u2014on a\ncertain restrictive notion of behaviour\u2014do indeed behave\nidentically. The problem with Cartesianism is that it attempts to\naccount for these differences by hypothesizing the existence of occult\nor hidden causes.\n\nIn an attempt to defeat the Cartesian or Platonist and remind us that\nmental predicates have perfectly ordinary standards of application,\nRyle focuses on what is observable. It is part of his war against what\nis not only occult (and observable only through introspection) but\nalso against what is hidden from the viewpoint of a third-party\nobserver. But, in focussing on what is observable, he does not commit\nhimself to reducing what is observable itself to sequences of\n\u201cmuscular behaviour\u201d. Those who attribute to Ryle a\n\u201csoft\u201d behaviourism are at least correct that the\nreminders he issues to ward off Cartesianism include frank appeal to\nwhat he later will describe as actions much higher up on the\n\u201csophistication ladder\u201d like paying a bill, or scoring a\ngoal, as well as to what he will later call \u201cconcrete\u201d,\n\u201cper se\u201d, or \u201cinfra\u201d doings like\nscribbling numbers on a cheque book or kicking a ball between two\nposts.\n\nSurely, as his earlier critics pointed out (and as those who see him\nas a behaviourist ignore) some of the phenomena he allows will\nreintroduce a realm of private occurrences (dreams and imaginings will\nbe the paradigm case). But as Ayer suspects, this sort of\n\u201cghost\u201d is an honest ghost. Not simply (as Ayer suggests)\nbecause the phenomena do not command the stage of a private theatre:\nin the sense that no one else can tell us about them they are in that\nrespect\n private.[12]\n As Ryle himself admits, \u201cthe technical trick of conducting our\nthinking in auditory word-images, instead of spoken words, does indeed\nsecure secrecy for our thinking \u2026\u201d (1949a, 35).\n\nIt is an \u201chonest ghost\u201d since privacy or secrecy of\ncertain episodes will not lead to privacy for them all; and thus the\nepistemological concomitant to the Official Doctrine that would lead\nto the problem of other minds is not a threat. Nor does this sort of\nprivacy usher in the semantic consequences of the Official Doctrine.\nThe privacy attending our dreams and imaginings does not impugn our\nright to draw on observable (in the robust sense of the term)\nphenomena to defend our right to employ mental predicates for a large\nnumber of cases, for \u201cthis secrecy is not the secrecy ascribed\nto the postulated episodes of the ghostly shadow-world\u201d (1949a,\n35).\n\nThere will indeed be cases in which only the agent can say whether she\nis pondering, imagining, dreaming, letting her mind wander,\ncalculating, solving, planning, or rehearsing. But the sort of privacy\nin which only she can say whether she was doing any of these or other\nparticular things is not the sort of privacy that gives rise to\nphilosophical conundrums like the problem of other minds and the\nproblem of necessarily private languages. On the contrary, the ability\nto describe one\u2019s dreams (as well as one\u2019s sensations)\npresupposes a language whose terms have established and\npublic criteria for their correct use.\n9. Dispositional Concepts\n\nA constant irritant for Ryle, throughout his writings, is \u201cthe\npreposterous assumption that every true or false statement either\nasserts or denies that a mentioned object or set of objects possesses\na specified attribute\u201d (1949a,\n 115).[13]\n As an example of a kind of sentence whose primary job is other than\nfact-stating, consider laws. Although we speak of law-sentences as\ntrue or false, \u201cthey do not state truths or falsehoods of the\nsame type as those asserted by the statements of fact to which they\napply or are supposed to apply\u201d (1949a, 116\u20137). The way to\nbring out the difference is to note that part of the point of trying\nto establish laws is to find out how to infer from particular matters\nof fact to other particular matters of fact, how to explain particular\nmatters of fact by reference to other matters of fact, and how to\nbring about or prevent particular states of affairs.\n\nA law, Ryle tells us, is \u201can inference ticket (a season ticket)\nwhich licenses its possessors \u2026 to move from one assertion to\nanother, to provide explanations of given facts, and to bring about\ndesired states of affairs by manipulating what is found existing or\nhappening\u201d (1949a, 117).\n\nA dispositional sentence such as \u2018Jones believes the earth is\nround\u2019 is unlike a law-sentence insofar as it mentions an\nindividual, Jones. But it is like a law-sentence insofar as its role\nis not (or not primarily) one of describing or reporting, or stating\nthat some object has such-and-such an attribute or stands in\nsuch-and-such a relation with another object. Its\n\u201ctruth-maker\u201d, to use a contemporary expression, has to be\nunderstood in terms of what would satisfy it as opposed to what it\npurportedly\n describes.[14]\n What would satisfy a law is not specified or mentioned in the\nlaw-sentence; similarly, what would satisfy a disposition is not\nspecified or mentioned in the disposition-sentence. Nor could it be.\nWhat would satisfy \u2018Jones believes the earth is round\u2019 is\nan open-ended (infinite) list of inferrings, imaginings, saying, and\ndoings (etc.) on the part of Jones (1949a, 44). (And note again, a\npropos of behaviourism, that if \u2018imagining\u2019 is construed\nin one of its ordinary senses, as something someone may be doing just\nby sitting, unmoving, with his hand on his chin, there is explicit\nreference to an irreducible-to-behaviour mental occurrence in this\nspecification of what would satisfy the sentence as well as the\nexplicit denial of the finiteness of the long list that would unpack\nthe sentence by alluding to its satisfaction conditions.)\n\nRyle suggests that \u2018John knows French\u2019 is a warrant which\ngives us the right to infer that John understands what he reads in\nLe Monde or that he is communicating successfully when\ntelephoning in French. Immediately on specifying what we are\nentitled to do with the inference ticket \u2018John knows\nFrench\u2019, Ryle admits that the examples of what would satisfy the\nsentence are too precise, for\n\n[w]e should not withdraw our statement that he knows French on finding\nthat he did not respond pertinently when asleep, absentminded, drunk,\nor in a panic; or on finding that he did not correctly translate\nhighly technical treatises. We expect no more than that he will\nordinarily cope pretty well with the majority of ordinary French-using\nand French-following tasks. \u2018Knows French\u2019 is a vague\nexpression and, for most purposes, none the less useful for being\nvague. (1949a, 119)\n\n\nTo adopt a couple contemporary turns of phrases, the warrants or\ninference tickets provided are therefore pro tanto and\noccasion-sensitive. The latter is yet another feature of\nRyle\u2019s view that puts him at a safe distance from the ideals of\nanalytical behaviourism. \n\nRyle concedes that what he says about dispositional sentences is\nlikely to be contested by the \u201caddicts of the superstition that\nall true indicative sentences either describe existents or report\noccurrences\u201d (1949a, 119). How could the statement \u2018This\nwire conducts electricity\u2019 or \u2018Jones believes the earth is\nround\u2019 be true unless there were something now going on, albeit\nunfortunately behind the scenes? (Note that this applies to those\ntoday who take it for granted that dispositional concepts report\nexistences (\u2019dispositions\u2019) which in turn, it is argued,\nrequire \u2019causal bases\u2019 to facilitate prediction,\nexplanation, and modification.) But consider Ryle\u2019s argument\nagainst this. Even those who are attracted by this picture will have\nto admit that we often do know that a wire conducts electricity, that\nan individual knows French, that a person is proud, that a sugar cube\nis soluble, without having discovered anything in the appropriate\nsense \u201chidden\u201d (read: accessible via introspection or\nlaboratory experiment). In any case what would be the point or the\ntheoretical utility of discovering what is hidden? Ryle suggests the\nutility would consist only in its entitling us to do just that\npredicting, explaining, and modifying which we already do and often\nknow that we are entitled to do. Even if these postulated processes\nwere conceded, they themselves are hypotheses or inferences to\n(\u201cthe best explanation\u201d): processes the existence of which\nare inferred from the fact that we can predict, explain, and modify\nthe observable actions and reactions of individuals. So if a theorist\ndemands actual \u201crails\u201d to ground ordinary inferences, this\ntheorist will have to provide some further \u201crails\u201d to\njustify his own peculiar inference from the legitimacy of ordinary\ninferences to the purported \u201crails\u201d that he supposes to\nground them. \u201cThe postulation of such an endless hierarchy of\n\u2018rails\u2019 could hardly be attractive even to those who are\nattracted by its first step\u201d (1949a, 120). \n10. Self-knowledge\n\nThe editors of a contemporary volume on self-knowledge write:\n\nEach of us effortlessly knows an enormous amount about those of our\nattributes which go with our rationality, sentience, and affective\nsusceptibilities: our beliefs, hopes, desires, and fears, whether we\nhave a headache or an itchy toe, whether we are elated or depressed,\nwhom we love and hate, what attracts or repels us. (Wright, et. al.,\n1)\n\n\nWhereas knowledge of others\u2019 sensations, emotions, and\nintentional states demands reliance on independently articulatable\ngrounds, self-knowledge is, by contrast, characteristically immediate.\nThis immediacy is already enough to be philosophically perplexing, but\nnot only do we know differently from others what we think,\nhope, and feel, we are also, in normal circumstances, regarded as\nknowing best. Furthermore, if we do enjoy certain mental\nattributes, we are expected to know that we do: our mental states are\nsalient to us. According to the editors, \u201c[t]hese three features\nof the epistemology of self-knowledge\u2014immediacy,\nauthority, and salience\u2014combine to set a\ncertain explanatory problem \u2026\u201d.\n\nTo what extent does this explanatory puzzle arise because of a tacit\nallegiance to Cartesianism? We have already seen how the\nepistemological consequences of the Official Doctrine lead to the\nproblem of other minds. The other side of the Cartesian coin seems to\nput us in an especially privileged position with respect to our own\nminds. For, if ascribing mental predicates to others is problematic,\naccording to the Official Doctrine, ascribing them to ourselves is\nproblem-free. Immediacy, authority, and salience are features of the\nepistemology of self-knowledge that the Cartesian view is best-placed\nto accommodate.\n\nRyle would see this contemporary expression of the problem of\nself-knowledge as a result of the conflation of various suspect\nphilosophical tendencies. One of these has its roots in the\nepistemological strand of the Official Doctrine; another is the\ntendency of philosophers to underestimate the many-layered complexity\nof mental discourse. This includes the refusal to acknowledge that the\nsame sentence may have different elasticities or kinds of jobs, as\nwell as the tendency to favour sentence-jobs of informing, describing\nor reporting over those, for example, of explaining, exhorting,\nencouraging, or admonishing.\n\nFor if self-knowledge is to be construed as a sort of perception of\ninner states or events that are (by the special faculty of\nintrospection or by the \u201crefulgence\u201d of consciousness)\n\u201cvisible\u201d to me but not to others, then Cartesianism,\nthough seeming to leave knowledge of our own minds intact, instead\npresents an untenable picture of what this \u201cknowledge\u201d can\nbe. Sorting out this confusion puts what can genuinely be called\nself-knowledge on relative parity with other-knowledge. It will also\nleave room for the importance of \u201cunstudied talk\u201d,\n\u201cego-pronouncements\u201d, or \u201cavowals\u201d, which do\nenjoy protection from epistemic criticism. But once the nature of this\nprotection is understood, philosophical perplexity should be\nextinguished, not kindled.\n\nRyle accepts the sort of privacy or secrecy that attends our dreams,\nimaginings and silent soliloquies and he concedes that besides the\ndispositional one there is another sense of \u2018know\u2019 which\nhas to do with what a person is presently thinking, feeling or doing.\nHe does not deny the existence of mental processes of this kind\n(again, a reason to resist calling him a \u2018behaviourist\u2019);\nnor does he deny that I am the only one in a position to say what, for\nexample, my musings, ponderings, or dreams are about. Nor does Ryle\ndeny that usually when we witness something, or feel something, or act\nin such-and-such a way we are able, when asked, to give a correct\naccount of it. He denies, rather, that either the\n\u201cluminous\u201d or \u201crefulgent\u201d view of\nconsciousness or one that buys into the intellectualist legend is\nrequired to accommodate this ability. He acknowledges that the concept\nof visualizing, imagining, or \u201cseeing\u201d in the mind\u2019s\neye, and \u201chearing\u201d in the mind\u2019s ear are useful\nconcepts. He denies that these uses commit us to the existence of\npictures or images that we contemplate or tunes that we hear: rather\nthan construe someone who pictures his nursery as the spectator of a\nresemblance of his nursery, he should be construed as resembling a\nspectator in his nursery (1949a, 234).\n\nRyle\u2019s discussion of avowals introduces, in effect, a different\nelasticity in our use of \u2018know\u2019, when we say, for example,\nthat usually a person knows what she is on about. This has to do with\nher propensity to avow moods, feelings, inclinations, intentions,\ndesires, and so forth. One striking feature of avowals is that they\nseem to enjoy a special kind of security from epistemic assessment or\ncriticism. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d or \u201cI think you must\nbe mistaken\u201d or \u201cYou have been careless in your\nobservations\u201d do not make sense as rejoinders to avowals. For\nRyle,\n\n[i]f the avowal [\u201cI feel depressed\u201d] is to do its job, it\nmust be said in a depressed tone of voice; it must be blurted out to a\nsympathizer, not reported to an investigator. Avowing \u201cI feel\ndepressed\u201d is doing one of the things, namely one of the\nconversational things, that depression is the mood to do. It is not a\npiece of scientific premises-finding, but a piece of conversational\nmoping. (1949a, 99)\n\n\nRyle warns against construing the fact that avowals are unassailable\nas indicating that there is special kind of knowledge in play. From\nthe fact that these utterances are protected from epistemic assessment\nor criticism it does not follow that we have a special kind of\nknowledge about them; any more, says Ryle, than it follows from the\nfact that someone is not a quack doctor that he is a good doctor: for\nhe may not be a doctor at all (1993b, 216). For with the idea of\nknowledge comes the idea of truth, of justification, of\nrepresentation, of description, of taking closer looks, etc.\n\nThe standards for assessing \u201cego-pronouncements\u201d run along\nlines of sincerity/insincerity where these in turn are cashed out in\nterms of lying, feigning (for fun), acting (in a play), putting on\n(for sympathy), etc. When lying, feigning, etc., are ruled out, then\nsomeone\u2019s saying so may be on some particular occasion what\njustifies us in accepting or what gives us a reason to accept what he\nsays. The question of his being wrong (as measured against some\nadditional standard) may not arise. If he is not wrong in saying that\nhe is in pain (because he can only be lying or insincere in the ways\nthat we are imagining have been ruled out) it does not follow that he\nhas a special kind of knowledge. Rather, it would be more appropriate\nto say that questions of knowledge are here out of place. The\ndiscussion of avowals, then, illustrates yet another elasticity or\nsentence-job for certain mental expressions. None of this is to deny\nthat \u201cI am in pain\u201d, for example, may have a use which, on\nsome occasion, counts as a description. Indeed, it may be both a\ndescription and a complaint (1993a, 214).\n\nMany contemporary discussions in philosophy of mind and\nself-knowledge, accepting a modern variant of the assumptions of\nCartesianism, are committed to the view that in using mental\npredicates, we (or the subject) attribute(s) to the subject a mental\nstate or condition of which her subsequent behaviour is a causal,\ncontingent manifestation. But once the assumption is made that mental\nverbs function to pick out such underlying states or events, then\nseemingly incompatible demands are placed upon these states and the\ntraditional philosophical problem of self-knowledge is revealed.\nConstrued as speaking from and expressing an occurrent state the\nspeaker is authoritative; construed as speaking from or referring to a\ndispositional state she is not.\n\nIn Ryle\u2019s (and in Wittgenstein\u2019s) hands, pointing to the\nnon-descriptive, expressive, use of an utterance such as \u201cI\nintend to go to the store\u201d or \u201cI am bored\u201d is\nsupposed to put to rest the mystery of the avower\u2019s presumptive\nauthority; it is not supposed to invite the development of a\nphilosophical account to explain it. It constitutes a step not only in\nrebutting the Cartesian\u2019s accommodation of this authority, but\nalso in denying that there is only one use of the relevant\nexpression\u2014namely, to describe or designate a state, occurrence,\nor property\u2014in the first place.\n\nSimilar considerations apply when we consider perplexities about the\nSelf, such as when children ask \u201cWhere was I before I was\nborn?\u201d or (we might add) when many of us wonder \u201cWhere\nwill I be after I die?\u201d What, precisely, is the mysterious\nreferent of \u201cI\u201d, \u201cme\u201d, and\n\u201cmyself\u201d? Since the way out of this puzzle is not merely a\nrejection of the para-mechanical hypothesis, Ryle suggests a different\ndiagnosis:\n\nGratuitous mystification begins from the moment that we start to peer\naround for the beings named by our pronouns. \u2026 [however] the way in\nwhich the people mentioned are identified by pronouns is quite\ndifferent from the way in which they are identified by proper names.\n(1949, 179)\n\n\nLike the index finger used to point to an object, pronouns function as\n\u201cindex words\u201d. Indexicals such as \u201chere\u201d,\n\u201cnow\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d ,\u201cshe\u201d,\n\u201cI\u201d and \u2019\u201cmyself\u201d indicate the place,\ntime, or person referred to. \u201cI\u201d is not an extra name for\nan extra being any more than \u201cnow\u201d is a name for a special\ntime: \n\n\n\u2026 it indicates, when I say or write it, the same individual who can\nalso be addressed by the proper name \u201cGilbert Ryle\u201d.\n\u201cI\u201d is not an alias for \u201cGilbert Ryle\u201d; it\nindicates the person whom \u201cGilbert Ryle\u201d names, when\nGilbert Ryle uses \u201cI\u201d. (1949, 180)\n\n\nFurthermore, the first personal pronoun has different elasticities of\nuse. Sometimes \u201cmyself\u201d, for example, can be replaced by\n\u201cmy body\u201d (or parts of my body), as in \u201cI am warming\nmyself (my hands) by the fire\u201d. In other contexts such pronouns\ncannot be so replaced. \n\n\nIt makes perfect sense to say that I caught myself just beginning to\ndream, but not that I caught my body beginning to dream, or that my\nbody caught me doing so \u2026. [1949, 181].\n\n\nThe puzzles are multiplied rather than solved when we talk of the Self\nas akin to a business\u2014with, for example, an executive branch\nand subordinate departments\u2014or a University\u2014with\nwarring or collaborative Faculties representing mental capacities.\n\u201cMyself\u201d and \u201cI\u201d, in the example above, are\nindex words or indexicals used in different senses or with different\nlogical ties, in different sorts of contexts.  \n\nThe construal of \u201cI\u201d as a name renders its supposed\nnominatum, the Self, and one\u2019s awareness of oneself, or\nself-consciousness, particularly elusive. For though we can catch hold\nof our streams of thoughts, and we can comment on this awareness, and\nperhaps even reflect upon our self-comment, and then regret having\nspent so much time in self-reflection, \u2026\u2014we can never capture\nthe last episode of self-awareness, until another one comes along\nwhich will, though capturing the last, will itself be elusive. \n\n\n\u2026 the more [one] puts one\u2019s finger on what the \u201cI\u201d\nstands for, the less does [one] succeed in doing so \u2026 Like the\nshadows of one\u2019s own head, it will not wait to be jumped on. And\nyet it is never very far ahead; indeed, sometimes it seems not to be\nahead of the pursuer at all. (1949, 178]) \n\n\nThe way out of the mystery is, again, to recognise that\n\u201cI\u201d does not name an elusive Self any more than\n\u201cnow\u201d names an elusive Present. Neither functions as\nnames. They indicate the person who utters it or the time it is\nuttered. \n\n\n\u2026 there is nothing mysterious or occult about the range of\nhigher-order acts and attitudes, which are apt to be inadequately\ncovered by the umbrella-title \u201cself-consciousness\u201d. They\nare the same in kind as the higher-order acts and attitudes exhibited\nin the dealings of people with one another. Indeed the former are only\na special application of the latter and are learned first from them.\nIf I perform the third order operation of commenting on a second order\nact of laughing at myself for a piece of manual awkwardness, I shall\nindeed use the first personal pronoun in two different ways \u2026. But so\nfar from this showing that there are two \u201cMes\u201d in my skin,\nnot to speak, yet , of the third on which is still commenting on them,\nit shows only that I am applying the public two-pronoun idiom in which\nwe talk of her laughing at him; and I am applying the method of\ninter-personal transaction which the idiom is ordinarily employed to\ndescribe. (1949,189) \n\n11. Thinking\n\nRyle\u2019s express target in The Concept of Mind was the\nCartesianism of the Official Doctrine, and the ontological,\nepistemological and semantic predicament we would be confronted with\nif the view were correct. Because of this target, many of his\nreminders about how mental expressions are used point to the kinds of\ncircumstances and performances that would satisfy them: often these\ninclude what others suitably trained have no trouble seeing. But he\nwas dissatisfied that in this work he left out some of the cardinal\nuses of concepts of thinking, in which there may be no performances\nfor others to witness. Certainly, the concept of thinking applies to\nobservable performances. But it also applies to the many\nthinking-activities we may imagine of Rodin\u2019s Le\nPenseur who is merely sitting on a rock with his chin in his\nhand. Ryle\u2019s professed long-range objective in much of his later\nwork was to come to an understanding of the various sorts of thinking\nqua pensive without committing either the\n\u201cCategory-howler of Behaviourism or the Category-howler of\nCartesianism\u201d (1979a, 17). In these later articles, he suggests\nthat what is needed besides the choice between \u201cnot muscular,\ntherefore inner\u201d or \u201cnot inner, therefore muscular\u201d\nis a way of enlarging the domain of the mental so that it includes not\nonly actions or performances but also certain omissions or failures to\nact that are conceived on a relatively high step of the ladder of\nsophistication of mental discourse (1979c, 119).\n\nLike all or at least most philosophically interesting concepts, Ryle\nthought there was no general answer to the question \u2018What does\nthinking consist of?\u2019 (any more that there is a general answer\nto the question \u2018What does working consist of?\u2019).\n\nWhen we start to theorise about thinking, we naturally hanker to\nfollow the chemist\u2019s example, namely, to say what thinking\nconsists of and how the ingredients of which it consists are\ncombined \u2026. But modelling thinking on processes like perspiring,\ndigesting, counting, and apple-picking, which can be broken down into\ningredient processes which have been coordinated in a certain way is a\nmistake \u2026. (1951b, 260)\n\n\nThere is a host of widely different sorts of toiling and idlings,\nengaging in any one of which is thinking.\n\nRyle rejects the view that thinking is symbol manipulation: indeed, he\ndenies that words, phrases or sentences are symbols, if symbols are to\nbe understood as proxies or as representations for something else\n(perhaps that which the word is alleged to designate). Thinking, in\nthe sense of pondering, calculating, and musing, is not reserved for\nthe labour of trying to decide things. Nor do we reserve the title\n\u2018thinking\u2019 for inner processes. An architect can think out\nhis plan while manipulating toy bricks as can a sculptor plan a statue\nin marble by modelling a piece of plasticine. Additional labours might\nbe necessary to put these plans into words. In general, thinking\nshould not be equated with using language.\n\nOur ordinary ways of describing our ponderings and musings tend to be\ngraphic and not literal. They should be histories, not chronicles, and\nas such the plot should be told in abstraction from any particular\nstream-of-consciousness reports of detail we may recall. In only some\ncases of thinking the accomplishment of a task, if there is one,\ninvolves the thinker\u2019s being equipped to declare his policy,\nscheme or theory. But there can be thinking where there is no talking\nor even the attempt to talk. Mozart\u2019s thinking results in\nsomething playable, not statable; Cezanne may make mistakes but is not\nin error. A symphony is not composed in English or German, it has no\ntranslation, and there is no evidence for or against it. Thus,\nalthough it is an important truth that the products of thinking may be\npublishable truths or falsehoods (and not unshareable\nintrospectibles), this is true for only some types of thinking (1979b,\n85).\n\nWhen the thinking does result in propositions or sayings, however, the\ntemptation is on the one hand toward excessive inflation, and on the\nother toward excessive deflation. For the result is not merely a\nstring of words linked together in a grammatically well-formed\nsentence. In recognising this truth, however, we are tempted toward\nthe view that bits of language are only necessary as the interpersonal\nvehicles of objective Meanings that are thinkable, in principle, to\nany hearers or readers of any nationalities.\n\nThese Meanings are for the Duplicationist those significance-cargoes\nthat are carried indifferently by your French and my English internal\nlocutions\u2014though the challenge to exhibit to his Reductionist\ncritic even one such cargo, prised off its French or English vehicle,\nis as usual unwelcome to him. (1979b, 87)\n\n\nRyle\u2019s solution is to reject the vehicle-cargo model. In owning\na penny, the duplicationist is right in saying I own more than a mere\nmetallic disc; but the reductionist is also right in rejecting the\nidea that I own two things: a mere disc and a non-metallic,\nunpocketable yet marketable cargo. The word I employ is not a noise\nand something else as well; nor is just a noise. In learning a\nword\u2019s meaning, I become enabled to conduct with it a host of\ninter alia informative, calculative, recording,\nanagram-solving, and versifying transactions of quite specific kinds.\nJust as a penny is not just a disc and nor is it a disc and something\nelse as well, so a word is not just noise, but nor is it a noise and\nsomething else as well. The penny is an institutionally-qualified\nenabling instrument that I can use for specific sorts of transactions.\nThe word is a complexly qualified noise, endowed with a quite specific\nsaying-power, endowed by institutional regulations, accumulating\npublic custom, pedagogic disciplines, and so on. The formulation of\nthe qualifications of both penny and word would \u201crequire not\njust some simple auxiliary nouns, simple adjectives or simple verbs\nbut a whole batch of syntactically variegated subordinate\nclauses\u201d (1979b, 88).\n\nEven if it is true that Le Penseur is saying things to\nhimself, this description fails because it stops just where it ought\nto begin. \u2018Murmuring syllables\u2019 to himself is the thinnest\npossible description of what he is engaged in. A thick description may\nbe that he is trying to find out whether or not the things that he is\nsaying will lead him where he wants to go:\n\n\u2026 in his pondering, reflecting, deliberating, etc., the thinker\nis not guiding himself anywhere, but trying to find out whether this\nor that track of his own making would or would not qualify as a\nguiding, as opposed to a mis-guiding, or non-guiding, track. (1968,\n494)\n\n\nExploring is on a higher-sophistication level than piloting; and\npiloting is on a higher sophistication level than following a\npilot\u2019s lead. If Le Penseur is trying to find the proof\nof a new theorem then he is working on a higher accomplishment-level\nthan he is in trying to teach his student his proof when he has got\nit; just as trying to teach it is on a higher-sophistication level\nthan that on which his students are working in trying to master\nit.\n\nOn its thinnest description, Le Penseur may be muttering to\nhimself a few geometrical words or phrases, just as on its thinnest\ndescription a penny is a piece of metal. But to say that that is not\nall he is doing (or that that is not all the penny\nis) is consistent with saying it is the only thing he is doing or with\ndenying that the penny is a piece of metal and something else as\nwell.\n\nA statesman signing his surname to a peace-treaty is doing much more\nthan inscribe the seven letters of his surname, but he is not doing\nmany or any more things. He is bringing war to a close by inscribing\nthe seven letters of his surname. (1968, 496)\n\n\nThinking can be saying things to oneself under a thin description.\nUnder a thicker description it may be saying things to oneself with\nthe specific heuristic intention of trying to open one\u2019s eyes or\nconsolidate one\u2019s grasp. It is this specific, experimental\nintention that is obliterated, Ryle tells us, by sweeping generic\nslogans such as \u201cThought is Language\u201d or \u201cThinking\nis Saying Things to Oneself\u201d, whether or not this is\nsupplemented by \u201c\u2026 and Something Else as Well.\u201d The\nadverb \u2018experimentally\u2019 adds not an extra action but the\nintention-to-find-out-what-happens-when \u2026. Neither the\nReductionist nor the Duplicationist (the Behaviourist or the\nCartesian) can account for the adverb\n\u2018experimentally\u2019.\n\nThey had tried to tell us what pondering is, eluding that little knot\nof subordinate clauses, such as \u2018\u2026 in order\nto \u2026\u2019, \u2018what happens\u2026\u2019, and\n\u2018\u2026 when \u2026\u2019 without which the notion of\nexperimenting cannot be unpacked; no more than burglary,\ntreaty-signing, or goal-scoring can deliberately be described in\nsimple adjectives plus simple verbs, whether mundane or\ntranscendent. What qualifies an undertaking as one of pondering or,\nnot very differently, as one of discussing, is not any catalogue of\nsimple qualities and simple relations, whether rude or refined, but\nsome nexus of statable because statement-shaped conditions. (1979b,\n82)\n\n12. Sensation\n\nRyle was unhappy with the treatment he gave of the concepts of\nsensation and perception in The Concept of Mind. In both the\nForeword and the Afterword of the chapter entitled \u201cSensation\nand Observation\u201d, he expresses his dissatisfaction at having\ngiven too much to the opposition by having \u201cfallen in\u201d\nwith the Official story that perceiving involves having\nsensations.\n\nIn a later paper (1956) Ryle corrects this. The idea that perceiving\ninvolves \u201chaving sensations\u201d is called into question with\nan investigation of the ordinary concepts of sensation and feeling and\ntheir relation to the technical notions of sense-impression and\nsense-data. (Arguably, today\u2019s notion of \u201cperceptual\nexperiences\u201d \u2013 conceptual or non-conceptual\u2014also\nfigure as a target of Ryle\u2019s arguments.) In this section, I\nshall discuss the negative thesis that perception does not require the\npostulation of sensations construed in its ordinary sense and why one\nmotivation for postulating sense-data or sense-impressions should be\nresisted. In the next, I discuss a different motivation and show why\nthe thickness of perceptual concepts thwarts attempts to discover the\n\u201cnature\u201d of perception in physiological, optical,\nacoustic, etc. phenomena.\n\nBoth philosophers and physiologists \u201cpass without apology\u201d\nfrom saying that without optical or auditory sense-impressions there\nis no seeing or hearing to saying that seeing and hearing involve the\nhaving of sensations. But can the sense-impressions which are\nsupposedly required for perception be identified with sensations or\nfeelings in one of their non-technical senses?\n\nRyle suggests not. On one understanding of \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201csensation\u201d we include pains, nausea, tickles,\nsuffocation, and thirst, which are distressing in some way. (In the\nConcept of Mind he notes that not all\n\u201cagitations\u201d are disagreeable: \u201cPeople voluntarily\nsubject themselves to suspense, fatigue, perplexity, fear, and\nsurprise \u2026\u201d(95).)\n\nA different understanding of \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201csensation\u201d comes with tactual sensations of external\nobjects and kinaesthetic sensations (of anatomically internal things\nand events). Instances of the latter include the feeling of warmth,\nsay, as my hand approaches a fire or feeling how cold, rough, smooth,\nslippery, or sticky some things are or whether they are vibrating,\nstiff, resilient, or loose.\n\nPace Berkeley, the difference between these types of states\nis not merely a matter of degree: feeling the warmth of a fire is not\nlike a feeling of pain. Feeling the fire is hotter than it was before\nis a matter of perception, discrimination, or finding out a\ndifference. People can be better at it than others: doctors acquire\nthe skill of feeling pulses that an untrained person cannot and race\ndrivers feel a car going into a skid well before an ordinary motorist\ncan. Feeling pain, giddy, nauseous, or high, by contrast are not a\nmatter of perception, an acquired skill or that which training can\nfine-tune. Mistakes due to carelessness are ruled out when we talk of\nsensations qua pain or elation; they are not ruled out when\nit comes to perception as discrimination or detection.\n\nArmed with these two sets of implication threads (and in this sense,\ndifferent understandings of, or things we count\nas) sensation or feeling, it can be seen that perception\nrequires neither of these. Seeing a cat does not require that I feel\nanything in the sense of pain, discomfort, tickle, giddiness, or calm\n(nor, we can add, relief, amusement, surprise, or rapture). Nor,\nhowever, does seeing a cat or hearing a violin require that I\ntactually or kinaesthetically feel with my eye or with my ear that\nwhich I also perceive. Nor does smelling require that I feel, in this\nsense, with my nose. And though the tongue is a double-sense organ\ninsofar as I can tactually and kinaesthetically detect the texture and\nthe temperature of food in my mouth, as well as taste it, tasting food\ndoes not depend upon my being able to feel these other properties of\nthe food with my tongue.\n\nSo, Ryle says, when philosophers and psychologists assert that all\nperceiving involves the having of sensations or the feeling of\nsomething, either they are wrong or they are using a third, different\nunderstanding of \u201csensation\u201d or \u201cfeeling\u201d.\n\nLet us examine this different sense of \u201cfeeling\u201d or\n\u201csensation\u201d. It does not seem to derive from ordinary use,\nwhich, we might suggest, would not in itself be a problem, as long as\nthe implication threads of one understanding are not crossed with\nthose of another. Consider the epistemologist\u2019s notion of\nsense-data or sense-impressions which are posited as candidates for\ngrounding knowledge or certainty in what is supposedly given in\nperception. Suppose this third understanding of sensation or\nfeeling derives from sense-data or sense-impressions thus\nunderstood. Whatever the merits or demerits of this view, in order for\nsensations\u2014now understood as sense-impressions or\nsense-data\u2014to play this foundational role, we must be\nconscious of them. Curiously enough, however, we do not report them.\nInstead, we report what we see under different descriptions, which\ncarry different luggage-loads. (Or, as Austin said, we report what we\nsee under different descriptions which depend, in part, on how far we\nare willing to stick our neck out.) Someone who claimed to see\nsomething green might subsequently, when he learns of the presence of\na cat, claim that what he saw was the eyes of a cat. The\n\u201cluggage\u201d that Ryle speaks of here includes the logical\nthreads (including implication and evidence, etc.) that accompany\ncertain descriptions rather than others. (There are more ways to be\nwrong, as Austin says, the more we stick our necks out.) We shall come\nback to this in the next section. But now we are investigating a\nthird, new sense of \u201csensation\u201d or \u201cfeeling\u201d\nwhich derives, not from ordinary use, but from the (alleged) needs of\nepistemology. But what supports the idea that we see have such\nexperiences?\n\nNot the fact that we report appearances, for, as Ryle reminds\nus, we use the locution \u201cit appears that \u2026\u201d all the\ntime without committing ourselves to having any particular\nexperiences. \u201c15 x 16 appears to make 220\u201d or \u201cIt\nlooks as if the river is twice the size of the road\u201d commit me\nto no special sense-experiences. So, argues Ryle, we cannot adduce\nidioms of the patterns \u201cIt looks as if \u2026\u201d or\n\u201cIt appears \u2026\u201d as evidence of the untutored,\nuninferential manner in which the postulated sense-impressions are\ndelivered to consciousness. But this leaves us with a problem.\n\nWe have, in fact, no special way of reporting the occurrence of these\npostulated impressions; we are, therefore, without the needed marks of\nour being conscious of such things at all. For there is surely\nsomething absurd in maintaining that we are constantly conscious of\nsome things in the way in which we are conscious of pains, and yet\nhave no way of telling ourselves or other people anything whatsoever\nabout them. (1956, 343)\n\nThis particular theoretical allegiance that drives some\nepistemologists to posit sensations understood in the technical sense\nof sense-data has as its source the idea that there are two kinds of\nspace, which we know today, thanks to Sellars, as the space of reason\nand the space of natural law. In the first, the notion of inference,\nevidence, premises, evidence, and conclusions have their home; in the\nother is the raw \u201cdata\u201d understood in the sense of that\nwhich is given or accepted without argument.\n\nThe allegiance to this picture has its source in the view that all\nthinking intended to result in the discovery or establishment of\ntruths is inferring. A child sees a word on a page, an adult sees a\nmisprint, and an illiterate sees a black mark. Each has eyes in\nperfect working order. According to this view, the difference between\nseeing black marks, a word, or a misprint has to do with the reasoning\nwe bring to what is perceptually given. And sense-data (or, we may\nadd, perceptual experience) play the role of what is given prior to\nany thinking, and prior therefore to any exploitation of knowledge or\nbeliefs previously acquired. A datum, as it is used here, is something\nthat we reason from and does not have to be reasoned\nto.\n\nRyle dismisses this motivation for introducing sensation thus\nunderstood on the grounds that not all thinking is inferring.\nMultiplying, for example, is thinking but our calculations are not\nconclusions and our mistakes are not fallacies. If it is not true that\nthe thinking that enters into perceptual recognition, identification,\ncomparison, etc. is inferring then the search for its fund of premises\nis the search for nothing.\n\nBut worse, why suppose that seeing the misprint or seeing a crop of\nwheat (as opposed to a word, or a planted field) is thinking at all?\nIt may be discerned in a flash; there may be no moment, however short,\nin which one might be described as pondering, reflecting, or putting\ntwo and two together. All the argument has shown so far is that\nwithout a particular training, recognising a misprint or a crop of\nwheat would be impossible. Why suppose the exploitation of the\nknowledge resulting from this training involves thinking qua\nreflecting, pondering, or inferring?\n\nHere the fact that the misprint is immediately obvious to him is\nsupposed to need to be explained not just by reference to his prior\neducation, but also by the postulation of the performance by him of a\npiece of thinking, with the queer property of not requiring any time\nfor its performance. (1956, 345)\n\nAccording to Ryle, seeing a misprint involves the possession of the\nexploitation of knowledge already acquired. But this exploitation of\nknowledge required for perceptual recognition, identification, etc.\nneed not embody any thinking; a fortiori, it need not embody\ninferential thinking. \u201cSo the argument for the occurrence of\nsense-impressions to be the data or premises for the inferential\nthinking embodied is doubly broken-backed\u201d (1956, 345).\n\nReaders interested in Ryle\u2019s thoughts about perception and\nimagination are referred to the following supplementary documents:\n\nRyle on Perception\nRyle on Imagination\n\n13. Afterword\n\nThis has been a short tour\u2014concentrating on the philosophy of\nlanguage and mind\u2014through but a patch of the rich philosophical\nlandscape that Ryle has charted. Left out are a number of themes and\ninterests of Ryle, for example, his discussion of traditions in\nphilosophy from Plato, through the Phenomenological tradition and the\nwork of Brentano, Husserl, and then Heidegger, through the trenchant\nexposition of Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus, to his\ncriticism of Carnap, to Collingwood, and Anderson. I have not\ncommented on the dissolution of philosophical problems\nhe presented in his Tarner Lectures; nor have I been able to include\ndiscussions on morality, feelings, pleasure, and much more. Nor is\nthis reading of Ryle a standard one: even many of his students\ninterpreted him as a behaviourist and irrealist. I hope it is enough,\nhowever, to raise the possibility that his work has been widely\nmisunderstood, is presently underestimated, and that he has a lot to\ncontribute to today\u2019s debates.",
