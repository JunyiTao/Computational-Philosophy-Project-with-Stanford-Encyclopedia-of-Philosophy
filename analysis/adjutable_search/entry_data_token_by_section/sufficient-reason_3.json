    "main_text": "Leibniz || What is a Sufficient Reason?\n3.1 What is a Sufficient Reason?\n\nWhen Leibniz insists that every truth or fact requires a sufficient\nreason, what does he mean by \u201csufficient reason?\u201d In some\ntexts he suggests that sufficient reason is an \u201ca\npriori proof\u201d. This should not be understood in Kantian\nterms as a proof that doesn\u2019t require any input from sense\nexperience. Rather, Leibniz uses the term \u201ca\npriori\u201d in its original pre-Kantian meaning, which means an\nargument from causes to effects. An a priori proof is a proof\nthat reflects the causal order. Thus, a sufficient reason would be a\nproof that is both a demonstration\u2014a set of premises and a\nconclusion such that the former necessitate the later\u2013and a\ncausal explanation\u2014a statement of the causal antecedents of some\ntruth or event (see Adams 1994: 109). \n\nIn order to fully understand Leibniz\u2019s conception of a\nsufficient reason, we need to also understand his theory of truth and\nits relationship to his theory of modality. Let us begin with truth.\nTo keep things simple, we will focus only on categorical propositions\nof subject-predicate form. A proposition is true, according to\nLeibniz, just in case the concept of the predicate is contained in the\nconcept of the subject. Uncontroversially, the concept of the\npredicate unmarried is contained in the concept\nbachelor and it is this conceptual containment which explains\nthe truth of the statement bachelors are unmarried. But\nLeibniz makes the further highly controversial claim that all\ntrue statements are true for this reason, even statements like\nCaesar crossed the Rubicon. That is, this statement is true\nbecause the concept crossed the Rubicon is contained in the\nconcept of Caesar. This theory of truth is sometimes called the\nconceptual containment theory of truth. It has as a\nconsequence that all truths are analytic. But wouldn\u2019t such a\ntheory entail that all truths are necessary? After all, how could an\nanalytic truth be contingent?\n\nIn response to this worry, Leibniz develops an account of contingency\nin terms of infinite\n analysis.[8]\n Leibniz understands analysis as the process of replacing the terms of\na proposition with definitions or partial definitions. A demonstration\nresults when an identity is obtained through the process of analysis\nin a finite number of steps. Leibniz claims that all and only\nnecessary truths have a finite demonstration by analysis and all and\nonly contingent truths do not have a demonstration by analysis in a\nfinite number of steps. In this way, he preserves the distinction\nbetween necessary and contingent truths while also maintaining that\nall truths are analytic, that is, true in virtue of the meaning of the\nconcepts involved.\n\nThis has led some commenters to think that Leibniz gave up the account\nof sufficient reason as an a priori proof. If there were a\nproof or demonstration, it would reveal that the concept of the\npredicate was contained in the concept of the subject in a finite\nnumber of steps and hence every proposition would be necessary.\nLeibniz is not a necessitarian in his late philosophy and thus he\ncould not have accepted this consequence. Instead, he must have\nshifted from the conception of a sufficient reason as an a\npriori proof to that of an a priori proof sequence,\nwhere the latter notion is understood as an analysis that converges on\nan identity without reaching it in a finite number of steps (see\nSleigh 1983: 200). What it means for an analysis to converge on an\nidentity is, unfortunately, obscure. Nevertheless, there is some clear\nsense in which every contingent truth has a sufficient reason on this\nunderstanding. The sufficient reason why it is true that Caesar\ncrossed the Rubicon, for example, is that the concept crossing the\nRubicon is contained in the concept Caesar. The truth of\nthe proposition obtains in virtue of the concepts of the subject and\nthe predicate. Of course, this reason is undiscoverable by any finite\nhuman mind because it is buried too deeply in the concept of Caesar.\nOnly God, in his omniscience sees the conceptual connection between\nthem. It is enough for there to be such a connection for there be a\nsufficient reason.\n\nSuch a conception of the nature of a sufficient reason have led some\ncommentators to think that for Leibniz the PSR is a logical notion or\nthat it is a metaphysical notion that is ultimately reducible to logic\n(Couturat 1901: 123ff and Russell 1937: v). But the notion of a\nsufficient reason as a non-terminating proof sequence is not the only\nconception of a sufficient reason to be found in Leibniz. And other\nconceptions have a decidedly less logical and more metaphysical\nflavor.\n\nOne such characterization of a sufficient reason comes from\nLeibniz\u2019s conviction that in order to preserve the notion of\ncausal activity, without which substances are not really\nsubstances\u2014i.e., truly fundamental building blocks of reality.\nEach genuine substance, for Leibniz, has what he calls a\n\u201cprimitive active force\u201d. This force is the nature or\nessence of the substance. Now according to Leibniz, substances do\nnot causally interact with one another (see the entry\n Leibniz on causation).\n The changes that they undergo derive solely from their own natures or\nprimitive active force, which consequently determines the whole of its\nhistory. Many texts suggest that, for Leibniz, the sufficient reason\nfor any state of a substance is its primitive active force (NE\n65\u20136; T 400/G VI, 354; Mon. 18/G VI, 609\u2013610; G IV, 507; G\nIII, 72).\n\nIn many ways primitive active force plays the role of the concept of\nthe subject in the logical version of the PSR. Just as on the logical\nversion the PSR that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) is explained by the fact\nthat the concept of \\(F\\)-ness is in the concept of \\(a\\),\nso too on the metaphysical version of the PSR fact that \\(a\\) is\n\\(F\\) is explained by the primitive active force of \\(a\\)\nthat determines it to be \\(F\\). Whereas commentators such as\nCouturat and Russell emphasize the logical notion of a sufficient\nreason to the detriment of the metaphysical notion, other commentators\nsee the logical and the metaphysical as two equally fundamental\npresentations of the same datum (see Frankel 1994).\n\nAnother metaphysical characterization of a sufficient reason connects\nwith the Principle of the Best, which says that for any proposition\n\\(p\\), \\(p\\) is true just in case \\(p\\) holds in the\nbest possible world (G VI.448/DM 22; Mon. 46, 53, 54/G VI,\n614\u2013616). Is the Principle of the Best a supplement to the PSR\nor a rival to the PSR? It is, in fact, a consequence of the PSR in\nconjunction with three additional assumptions: (1) the sufficient\nreason for every choice is that the chooser perceives it to be the\nbest; (2) God chooses the actual world; (3) God perceives something to\nbe what is best just in case it is the best.\n\nIn some texts, Leibniz suggests that the sufficient reason for\ncontingent truths cannot be found in the concepts or natures of\nthings. We must instead look to the Principle of the Best (Mon.\n36\u201338/G VI, 613). In other words the sufficient reason for any\ncontingent proposition of the form \u201c\\(a\\) is\n\\(F\\)\u201d is that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) is true in the best\npossible word. This appears to be an entirely different sort of reason\nthan the fact that \u201c\\(a\\) is \\(F\\)\u201d is analytic\nor that the nature of \\(a\\) determines that it is \\(F\\).\nThose latter reasons are to be found internal to the concept of the\nsubject or the nature of the substance. Reasons that advert to the\nPrinciple of the Best look outside the concept of the subject or the\nnature of the substance and make comparisons between worlds in terms\nof their relative perfections. It is possible that Leibniz thought\nthat these different conceptions of sufficient reasons were equivalent\nbut that they are so is far from obvious.\n",
