    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Two Questions about Manipulation\n1.3 Two Questions about Manipulation\n\nAs will be apparent from our discussion so far, two main questions\nneed to be answered by any satisfactory theory of manipulation.\n\nOne question\u2014call it the identification\nquestion\u2014concerns definition and identification: How can we\nidentify which forms of influence are manipulative and which are not?\nA satisfactory answer would presumably involve a general definition of\nmanipulation, which explains what the diverse forms of manipulative\ninfluence have in common. In addition to illuminating how the various\ninstances of manipulation are manifestations of a single more basic\nphenomenon, an answer to the identification question should also\nprovide criteria for determining whether a given instance of influence\nis manipulative. Such an analysis might, of course, show that some of\nthe phenomena that we were pre-theoretically inclined to count as\nmanipulation are relevantly different from clear cases of\nmanipulation, so that we might be led to revise our usage of the term\n\u201cmanipulation.\u201d\n\nA second question\u2014call it the evaluation\nquestion\u2014concerns morality: How should we evaluate the\nmoral status of manipulation? A satisfactory answer to this question\nshould tell us whether manipulation is always immoral. And if\nmanipulation is not always immoral, it should tell us how to determine\nwhen manipulation is immoral. But more importantly, a\nsatisfactory answer to the evaluation question should explain\nwhy manipulation is immoral when it is immoral. What feature\nof manipulation makes it immoral in those situations when it is\nimmoral?\n\nAlthough the identification and evaluation questions are distinct,\nthey are not entirely independent. Any analysis of why manipulation is\nimmoral (when it is immoral) will presuppose some account of what\nmanipulation is. Thus, our answer to the identification question will\nconstrain our answer to the evaluation question. But an answer to the\nidentification question might do more than constrain our\nanswer to the evaluation question: it might also guide it. If\nan account of manipulation identifies its underlying characteristic as\nbeing relevantly similar to some other thing that we have independent\ngrounds for regarding as morally wrong, then we would likely want to\nargue that manipulation is wrong for similar reasons. Finally, we\nmight need to adjust our answers to one or both questions if they\ntogether imply implausible consequences. For example, if we define\nmanipulation as every form of influence besides rational persuasion or\ncoercion, and then claim that the wrongness of manipulation is\nabsolute, we will be forced to conclude that no form of influence\nbesides rational persuasion is ever morally legitimate. This is a\nradical conclusion that few would be willing to accept, but it is a\nconclusion that results from combining a certain answer to the\nidentification question with a certain answer to the evaluation\nquestion.\n",
