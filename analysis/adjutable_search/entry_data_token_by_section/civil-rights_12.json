    "main_text": "Marriage Equality\n7. Disability\n\nDuring the 1970s and 80s, persons with disabilities increasingly\nargued that they were treated as second-class citizens by law and\nsociety. They organized into a civil rights movement that pressed for\nlegislation that would help secure for them the status of free and\nequal citizens. Protection against discrimination based on disability\nwas written into the\n Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,\n The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and the Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities. The disability rights movement in the U.S. culminated\nwith the passage of the\n Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990\n (ADA). The ADA has served as a model for legislation in countries\nsuch as Australia, India and Israel\n\nThe disability rights movement began with the idea that discrimination\non the basis of disability was not different in any morally important\nway from discrimination based on race. The aim of the movement was to\nenshrine in law the same kind of antidiscrimination principle that\nprotected persons based on their race. But some theorists have\nquestioned how well the analogy holds. They point out that applying\nthe antidiscrimination norm to disability, for example, by installing\nramps for access to buildings or offering special education programs,\nrequires taking account of physical or mental differences among\npeople. This seems to be treatment based on a person\u2019s physical\nor mental features, apparently the exact opposite of the ideal of\n\u201ccolorblindness\u201d behind the traditional antidiscrimination\nprinciple.\n\nEven race-based affirmative action does not really seem to be parallel\nto antidiscrimination policies that take account of disability.\nAdvocates of affirmative action assert that the social ideal is for\npersons not to be treated on the basis of their race or color at all.\nRace-conscious policies are seen as instruments that will move society\ntoward that ideal (Wasserstrom: 2001).\n\nIn contrast, policies designed to counter discrimination based on\ndisability are not sensibly understood as temporary measures or steps\ntoward a goal in which people are not treated based on their\ndisabilities. The policies permanently enshrine the idea that in\ndesigning buildings or buses or constructing some other aspect of our\nphysical-social environment, we must be responsive to the disabilities\npeople have in order for the disabled to have \u201cfair equality of\nopportunity\u201d (Rawls 2001: 43\u201344; Hartley 2009). The need\nfor a permanent \u201caccommodation\u201d of persons with disabilities marks an\nimportant difference in how the antidiscrimination norm should be\nunderstood in the context of disability, as opposed to the context of\nrace. However, it is important to recognize that, at the level of\nfundamental principle, the reasons why disability-based discrimination\nis morally objectionable and even unjust are parallel to the reasons\nwhy racial discrimination is so. At the individual level,\ndisadvantageous treatment of the disabled is often rooted in ill-will,\ndisregard, and moral arbitrariness. At the systemic level, such\ntreatment creates a social pattern of disadvantage that reduces the\ndisabled to second-class status. In those two respects, the grounds of\ncivil rights law are no different when it comes to the disabled.\n\nAnother way in which disability is thought to be different from race\nconcerns the special needs that the disabled often have that make life\nmore costly for them. These extra costs would exist even if the\nsocially-constructed physical environment were built to provide the\ndisabled with fair equality of opportunity and their basic civil and\npolitical liberties were secured. In order to function effectively,\ndisabled persons may need to buy medications or therapies or other\nforms of assistance that the able-bodied do not need for their\nfunctioning. And there does not seem to be any parallel in matters of\nrace to the special needs of some of those who are disabled. The\ndriving idea of the Civil Rights Movement was that blacks did not have\nany special needs: all they needed was to have the burdens of racism\nlifted from them and, once that was accomplished, they would flourish\nor fail like everyone else in society.\n\nHowever, Silvers (1998) argues that the parallel between race and\ndisability still holds: all the disabled may claim from society as a\nmatter of justice is that they have fair equality of opportunity and\nthe same basic civil rights as everyone else. Any special needs that\nthe disabled may have do not provide the grounds of any legitimate\nclaims of justice. On the other hand, Kittay (2000) argues that the\nspecial needs of the disabled are a matter of basic justice. She\nfocuses on the severely mentally disabled, for whom fair opportunity\nin the labor market and political rights in the public sphere will\nhave no significance, and on the families that have the responsibility\nof caring for the severely disabled. Pogge (2000) also questions\nSilvers\u2019 view, suggesting that it is implausible to deny that\njustice requires that society provide resources for meeting the needs\nof the severely disabled. Still, it may be the case that some version\nof Silvers\u2019 approach is justifiable when it comes to disabled\npersons who have the capacity \u201cto participate fully in the\npolitical and civic institutions of the society and, more broadly, in\nits public life\u201d (Pogge, 2000: 45). In the case of such persons,\nthe basic civil right to equal citizenship would require that they\nhave the equal opportunity to participate in such institutions,\nregardless of their disability. Although there may be some aspects of\nthe racial model that cannot be applied to persons with severe forms\nof mental disability, the principles behind the American civil rights\nstruggles of the 1950s and 60s remain crucial normative resources for\nunderstanding and combating forms of unjust discrimination that have\nonly more recently been addressed by philosophers and by society more\nbroadly.\n\nBarnes focuses on the category of physical disability and argues that\nthe conditions fitting under the category are \u201cstrikingly\nheterogenous\u201d (2016: 9 and 46) and that there is no feature\ncommon to the bodies of all (physically) disabled persons that makes\nthem disabled. On her account, disability is a socially-constructed\ncategory that \u201cpeople have found useful when organizing\nthemselves in a civil rights struggle\u201d and \u201cdisability\njust is whatever the disability rights movement is promoting\njustice for\u201d (43 \u2013 emphasis in original). Barnes adds that\nthe movement\u2019s judgments about which persons and conditions are\nincluded under its umbrella are not arbitrary but rather\n\u201crule-based\u201d and implicitly treat the category of\ndisability as a \u201ccluster-concept\u201d to be applied to\nphysical conditions that have \u201csome sufficient number of\nfeatures such as: being subject to social stigma and prejudice; being\nviewed as unusual or atypical; making ordinary daily tasks difficult\nor complicated; causing chronic pain; causing barriers to access\npublic places, \u2026 requiring the use of mobility aids or\nassistive technology [and] requiring medical care\u201d (45). What\nunifies the various conditions categorized as disabilities, in\nBarnes\u2019s view, is that they \u201care the kind of\nthing that the disability rights movement is trying to make the\nworld a better place to live with\u201d (48 \u2013 emphasis in\noriginal). To be clear, her view is not that the movement is\nrecognizing a \u201ckind of thing\u201d that would exist even in its\nabsence but that the movement creates the kind of thing we call\n\u201cdisability.\u201d Accordingly, if we ask about each of the\nconditions that fit under the category of physical disability,\n\u2018What does it have common with the other conditions in the\ncategory?, then Barnes thinks that the most illuminating answer is\nthat the disability rights movement is fighting for the just treatment\nof persons with that condition.\n\nNonetheless, it is difficult to see how Barnes\u2019s account can\nadequately explain why some stigmatized features, such as blindness\nand deafness, count as disabilities at the same time that others, such\nas dark skin and being Jewish, are not disabilities. Under Jim Crow,\ndark skin was stigmatized, atypical, made ordinary tasks (like getting\nmedical assistance or a bank loan) difficult, and caused barriers to\naccess public places (where \u201cwhites only\u201d signs were found\nat public parks, hospitals, bathrooms, and swimming pools). Yet, the\nCivil Rights Movement was not, even implicitly, a matter of\neliminating disadvantage based on disability, notwithstanding\nimportant parallels between race-based and disability-based\ndiscrimination (Lim 2018: 983\u201384).\nLegal Cases and Statutes\n\nAllen v.
