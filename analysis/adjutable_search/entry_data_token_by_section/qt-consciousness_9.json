    "main_text": "Quantum Mind || Concrete Applications\n4.2 Concrete Applications\n Decision Processes\n\nAn early precursor of work on decision processes is due to Aerts and\nAerts (1994). However, the first detailed account appeared in a\ncomprehensive publication by Busemeyer et al. (2006). The key\nidea is to define probabilities for decision outcomes and decision\ntimes in terms of quantum probability amplitudes. Busemeyer et\nal. found agreement of a suitable Hilbert space model (and\ndisagreement of a classical alternative) with empirical data.\nMoreover, they were able to clarify the long-standing riddle of the\nso-called conjunction and disjunction effects (Tversky and Shafir\n1992) in decision making (Pothos and Busemeyer 2009). Another\napplication refers to the asymmetry of similarity judgments (Tversky\n1977), which can be adequately understood by quantum approaches (see\nAerts et al. 2011, Pothos et al. 2013).\n Order Effects\n\nOrder effects in polls, surveys, and questionnaires, recognized for a\nlong time (Schwarz and Sudman 1992), are still insufficiently\nunderstood today. Their study as contextual quantum features (Aerts\nand Aerts 1994, Busemeyer et al. 2011) offers the potential\nto unveil a lot more about such effects than the well-known fact that\nresponses can drastically alter if questions are swapped. Atmanspacher\nand R\u00f6mer (2012) proposed a complete classification of possible\norder effects (including uncertainty relations, and independent of\nHilbert space representations), and Wang et al. (2014)\ndiscovered a fundamental covariance condition (called the QQ equation)\nfor a wide class of order effects.\n\nAn important issue for quantum mind approaches is the complexity or\nparsimony of Hilbert space models as compared to classical (Bayesian,\nMarkov, etc.) models. Atmanspacher and R\u00f6mer (2012) as well as\nBusemeyer and Wang (2018) addressed this issue for order effects, with\nthe result that quantum approaches generally require less free\nvariables than competing classical models and are, thus, more\nparsimonious and more stringent than those. Busemeyer and Wang (2017)\nstudied how measuring incompatible observables sequentially induces\nuncertainties on the second measurement outcome. \n Bistable Perception\n\nThe perception of a stimulus is bistable if the stimulus is ambiguous,\nsuch as the Necker cube. This bistable behavior has been modeled\nanalagous to the physical quantum Zeno effect. (Note that this differs\nfrom the quantum Zeno effect as used in\n Section 3.2.)\n The resulting Necker-Zeno model predicts a quantitative relation\nbetween basic psychophysical time scales in bistable perception that\nhas been confirmed experimentally (see Atmanspacher and Filk 2013 for\nreview).\n\nMoreover, Atmanspacher and Filk (2010) showed that the Necker-Zeno\nmodel violates temporal Bell inqualitities for particular\ndistinguished states in bistable\n perception.[15]\n This theoretical prediction is yet to be tested experimentally and\nwould be a litmus test for quantum behavior in mental systems. Such\nstates have been denoted as temporally nonlocal in the sense\nthat they are not sharply (pointwise) localized along the time axis\nbut appear to be stretched over an extended time interval (an extended\npresent). Within this interval, relations such as\n\u201cearlier\u201d or \u201clater\u201d are illegitimate\ndesignators and, accordingly, causal connections are ill-defined.\n Learning Processes\n\nAnother quite obvious arena for non-commutative behavior is learning\nbehavior. In theoretical studies, Atmanspacher and Filk (2006) showed\nthat in simple supervised learning tasks small recurrent networks not\nonly learn the prescribed input-output relation but also the sequence\nin which inputs have been presented. This entails that the recognition\nof inputs is impaired if the sequence of presentation is changed. In\nvery few exceptional cases, with special characteristics that remain\nto be explored, this impairment is avoided.\n Semantic Networks\n\nThe difficult issue of meaning in natural languages is often explored\nin terms of semantic networks. Gabora and Aerts (2002) described the\nway in which concepts are evoked, used, and combined to generate\nmeaning depending on contexts. Their ideas about concept association\nin evolution were further developed by Gabora and Aerts (2009). A\nparticularly thrilling application is due to Bruza et al.\n(2015), who challenged a long-standing dogma in linguistics by\nproposing that the meaning of concept combinations (such as\n\u201capple chip\u201d) is not uniquely separable into the meanings\nof the combined concepts (\u201capple\u201d and \u201cchip\u201d).\nBruza et al. (2015) refer to meaning relations in terms of\nentanglement-style features in quantum representations of concepts and\nreported first empirical results in this direction. \nQuantum Agency\n\nA quantum approach for understanding issues related to agency,\nintention, and other controversial topics in the philosophy of mind\nhas been proposed by Briegel and M\u00fcller (2015), see also\nM\u00fcller and Briegel (2018). This proposal is based on work on\nquantum algorithms for reinforcement learning in neural networks\n(\u201cprojective simulation\u201d, Paparo et al. 2012),\nwhich can be regarded as a variant of quantum machine learning (Wittek\n2014). The gist of the idea is how agents can develop agency as a kind\nof independence from their environment and the deterministic laws\ngoverning it (Briegel 2012). The behavior of the agent itself is\nsimulated as a non-deterministic quantum random walk in its memory\nspace.\n Super-Quantum Correlations\n\nQuantum entanglement implies correlations exceeding standard classical\ncorrelations (by violating Bell-type inequalitites) but obeying the\nso-called Tsirelson bound. However, this bound does not exhaust the\nrange by which Bell-type correlations can be violated in principle.\nPopescu and Rohrlich (1994) found such correlations for particular\nquantum measurements, and the study of such super-quantum correlations\nhas become a vivid field of contemporary research, as the review by\nPopescu (2014) shows. \n\nOne problem in assessing super-quantum correlations in mental systems\nis to delineate genuine (non-causal) quantum-type correlations from\n(causal) classical correlations that can be used for signaling.\nDzhafarov and Kujala (2013) derived a compact way to do so and\nsubtract classical context effects such as priming in mental systems\nso that true quantum correlations remain. See Cervantes and Dzhafarov\n(2018) for empirical applications, and Atmanspacher and Filk (2019)\nfor further subtleties. \n",
