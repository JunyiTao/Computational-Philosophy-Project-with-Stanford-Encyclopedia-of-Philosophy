    "main_text": "Culmination of the Classical Period || Dign\u0101ga\n4.1 Dign\u0101ga\n\nDign\u0101ga wrote three works pertaining to reasoning and argument.\nUnfortunately, in each case, the original Sanskrit text is not\navailable. One, the Ny\u0101ya-mukha (Introduction to\nlogic), is extant in Chinese translation.\u00a0However, a\nSanskrit manuscript is now known to exist in Tibet. It has yet to be\nedited and published. The remaining two are extant only in Tibetan\ntranslation: Hetu-cakra-\u1e0damaru (The drum wheel of\nreason) and his magnum opus,\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya (Compendium on epistemic\nmeans of cognition), four of whose six chapters are devoted to\ninference or argument.\n\nOne idea which is particularly clear in Dign\u0101ga\u2019s work is\nhis explicit recognition that arguments which are expressed as\nsyllogisms are expressions of inferences. This is reflected in his\nterms inference for oneself\n(sv\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na), which refers to the cognitive\nprocess expressible as a syllogism, and inference for another\n(par\u0101rtha-anum\u0101na), which refers to the verbal\nexpression of the syllogistic inference. These terms are also the\ntitles of the second and third chapters of his\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya.\n\nDign\u0101ga apparently enlarges the form of Vasubandhu\u2019s\ncanonical syllogism. Even though the texts just mentioned are not\nextant in Sanskrit, some of their commentaries are and some of these\ntexts\u2019 passages are found cited in existing Sanskrit works.\nAvailing himself of these works, S. Katsura (2004a p. 143) has\nidentified the following as an argument instantiating what\nDign\u0101ga considers the canonical form of a good syllogism.\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid):\nDign\u0101ga\n\n\n\nthesis:\nSound is non-eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause it is immediately connected with an effort. \n\nsimilarity example:\nThat which is immediately connected with an effort is observed\nto be non-eternal, like a pot. \n\ndissimilarity example:\nThat which is eternal is observed not to be immediately\nconnected with an effort, like space.  \n\n\n\nBefore discussing the syllogism, we must take notice of the word\npak\u1e63a (thesis), which Dign\u0101ga uses\ninstead of pratij\u00f1\u0101 (proposition). The\nword is used both for the statement, previously called a proposition\nand now called a thesis, as well as for the factual situation it\nexpresses. It is also used to refer to the grammatical subject of the\nthesis statement as well as to the thing denoted by the grammatical\nsubject. (See Staal 1973 for a lucid exposition of this and other\nambiguities in the technical terms of classical Indian logic.)\n\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s canonical syllogism, like that of Vasubandhu, has\nneither an application statement nor a conclusion statement. However,\nunlike that of Vasubandhu, it has two example statements. Each example\nstatement comprises a universal statement and a phrase naming\nsomething. In the case of the statement of similarity example, the\nuniversal statement asserts that whatever has the property adduced as\na reason (hetu) has the property to be established\n(s\u0101dhya-dharma), which is mentioned in the\nsyllogism\u2019s thesis, while the phrase names something, distinct\nfrom the subject (pak\u1e63a), yet similar to it with\nrespect to the property to be established\n(s\u0101dhya-dharma), and has the property adduced as the\nreason. The example named is said to be subject-like\n(sa-pak\u1e63a). In the case of the statement of\ndissimilarity example, the universal statement asserts that whatever\ndoes not have the property to be established\n(s\u0101dhya-dharma) does not have the property adduced as a\nreason (hetu) and the phrase names something dissimilar to\nsubject with respect to the property to be established and not having\nthe property adduced as the reason. The example named here is said to\nbe subject-unlike (vi-pak\u1e63a). Finally, Dign\u0101ga\nseems to have added a word to the formulation of the universal\nstatement, namely, the word observed\n(d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da), the past passive participle of the\nverb to see (d\u1e5b\u015b), which means not only\nto see but also to observe, to notice and even to know. Hereafter, we\nshall refer to a syllogism\u2019s reason statement as its minor\npremiss and the universal statement in its example statement as its\nmajor premiss.\n\nPerhaps most original in Dign\u0101ga\u2019s work on argument and\ninference is what he called the wheel of reasons\n(hetu-cakra), an equivalent alternative to the three forms of\nreason (tri-r\u016bpa-hetu). It comprises a three by three\nmatrix, which distinguishes a proper from an improper reason. It\nspecifies, on the one hand, the three cases of the reason\n(hetu) occurring in some, none, or all of subject-like things\n(sa-pak\u1e63a), and, on the other, the three cases of the\nreason (hetu) occurring in some, none, or all of\nsubject-unlike things (vi-pak\u1e63a). Letting H be the\nreason, S the subject-like things and \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\) the\nsubject-unlike things, we obtain the following table.\n\n\n\n\nH occurs in:\nall S\nall S\nall S \n\n\u00a0\nall \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nno \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nsome \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\) \n\nH occurs in:\nno S\nno S\nno S \n\n\u00a0\nall \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nno \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nsome \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\) \n\nH occurs in:\nsome S\nsome S\nsome S \n\n\u00a0\nall \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nno \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)\nsome \\(\\bar{\\mbox{S}}\\)  \n\n\n\nDign\u0101ga identified the syllogisms corresponding to the top and\nbottom cases of the middle column as good syllogisms and those\ncorresponding to the other cases as bad.\n\nThese developments have led to a rather lively debate among scholars\nof the development of logic in early classical India. A very succinct,\nbut somewhat misleading, way to put the question at the center of the\ndebate is whether or not Dign\u0101ga\u2019s canonical syllogism is\ninductive or deductive. A more cumbersome, but more precise, way to\nput the question is this: Is there a choice of a subject, of a\nproperty adduced as a reason, and of a property to be established\nwhich Dign\u0101ga would accept as constituting a good syllogism but\nwhich fails to satisfy the form corresponding to the canonical\nsyllogism given above?\n\nLet us now consider those aspects of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s treatment of\nthe syllogism which are at the center of this debate. One reason to\nthink that Dign\u0101ga would accept as a good syllogism one failing\nto be deductively valid might be his inclusion of the word\nobserved (d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da) in the example\nstatement. In other words, one might think that Dign\u0101ga would\naccept as a good syllogism one in which, even though it is not the\ncase that whatever has H has S, it is the case that whatever is\nobserved to have H has S: that is to say, the major premiss pertains\nonly to observed cases of H, and not for every case of H. However, no\nsuch syllogisms are accepted by Dign\u0101ga. Indeed, the addition of\nthe word observed (d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da) does not\npermit attributing such an idea to Dign\u0101ga, for the word is\nadded, not to the major premiss\u2019s subordinate, relative clause,\nbut to its main clause. Thus, what the major premiss says is not that\nevery observed instance of the reason (H) is an instance of the\nproperty to be established (S), but rather that every instance of the\nreason (H) is observed to be an instance of the property to be\nestablished (S). Moreover, if the word observed\n(d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da) has a factive sense, that is, a\nsense which presupposes the truth of the clause into which the word is\ninserted, as do several of its English translations, for example,\nnoticed, known, then the word in the statement\nleaves the truth conditions of major premiss unaffected.\n\nA further reason which has prompted scholars to think that included\namong the syllogisms Dign\u0101ga would accept as good ones are ones\nwhich might not be deductively valid is the fact that he has retained\nan example phrase in example statements, for such phrases have no\nbearing on the deductive validity of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s canonical\nsyllogism. This doubt is re-enforced by the fact that example\nstatements, stripped of their example phrases, are contrapositives of\none another. Thus, one being logically equivalent to the other is also\nlogically superfluous with respect to it. Yet, Dign\u0101ga seems to\nbe aware of the equivalence, for he acknowledges in his commentarial\ndiscussion of the three forms (PS 2.5) that the second and third forms\nare equivalent (Katsura 2000 p. 245; Katsura 2004b pp. 121\u2013124),\nfrom which it follows that any two statements, one of which satisfies\nthe second form and the other of which satisfies the third form are\nequivalent.\n\nThat said, it is nonetheless perfectly reasonable to exclude some\ndeductively valid syllogisms as good syllogisms. Consider, for\nexample, a syllogism whose conclusion is identical with one of its\npremisses. It is a deductively valid syllogism, though it is utterly\nunpersuasive. Dign\u0101ga, like any rational thinker, would not, and\ndid not, accept as a good syllogism any syllogism in which the reason\n(H) and the property to be established (S) are the same property, even\nif such syllogisms have the same form as the canonical syllogism\nabove. Excluding such circular syllogisms is fully consistent with the\nview that the syllogisms accepted by Dign\u0101ga are only deductively\nvalid ones. (For extensive scholarly discussion of the role of\nexamples in Buddhist arguments, see the collection of articles in\nKatsura and Steinkellner (eds.) 2004.)\n\nA good reason for Dign\u0101ga to retain an example phrase in the\nexample statements of his canonical syllogism would be to exclude\nsyllogisms which are patently unpersuasive, even though, like circular\nsyllogisms, they are deductively valid. Consider the following\nargument:\n\n\n\nthesis:\nSound is eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause it is audible. \n\nsimilarity example:\nWhatever is audible is eternal.  \n\n\nThis syllogism, rejected as a bad syllogism by Dign\u0101ga, was put\nforth by a school of Brahmanical thinkers who held, for doctrinal\nreasons, that sound is eternal. To maintain this claim in the face of\nobservation to the contrary, these thinkers maintained instead that\nwhat is transitory is the revelation of sound, not sound itself.\nAccording to them, in other words, sound is constantly present, but we\nhear it only when its presence is revealed.\n\nTheir syllogism as stated above, though deductively valid, is utterly\nunpersuasive. The reason is that the instances of audibility (H), are\ncoextensive with sound (p). Thus, there is no independent empirical\nevidence to support the universal statement that whatever is audible\nis eternal. Requiring that there be at least some thing different from\nsound which is both audible and eternal is an obvious and plausible\nway to eliminate such patently unpersuasive syllogisms. Dign\u0101ga,\ntherefore, rules out the syllogism as a bad syllogism, rather than, as\nwe would, accept it as a valid syllogism with an unpersuasive premiss.\n(See also Tillemans 1990.)\n\nBut this cannot be the entire explanation of why Dign\u0101ga appears\nto insist on example phrases in example statements, for nowhere does\nhe rule out as a good syllogism one which, though valid, is\nunpersuasive for want of some subject-unlike thing.\n\nBecause of the doubts just discussed, some scholars think that\nDign\u0101ga was not striving to work out a deductive form of\nreasoning and argument. Rather, according to some, such as Hayes\n(1980; 1988 ch. 4.2), Dign\u0101ga was seeking to develop an inductive\nform of reasoning and argument. According to others, such as Oetke\n(1994; 1996), Dign\u0101ga and some of his predecessors and\ncontemporaries were striving to spell out a defeasible form of\nreasoning and argument. (See Taber 2004 for a critical assessment of\nOetke\u2019s view.)\n\nA final contribution by Dign\u0101ga is found in the sixth and final\nchapter of his Pram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya, where he\naddresses fourteen fallacious rejoinders (j\u0101ti), each\nbearing the same name as one of the fourteen treated in\nVasubandhu\u2019s V\u0101da-vidhi, though sometimes the\nargument associated with a particular name in the\nPram\u0101\u1e47a-samuccaya is different from the one\nassociated with the name in the V\u0101da-vidhi. His\ntreatment is often different from, and critical of, the treatment\nfound in this earlier work.\n",
