    "main_text": "Ontological Aspects of Russell\u2019s Logical Atomism || Atomic Propositions, Logical Independence and Necessity\n5. Influence and Reception\n\n Russell\u2019s logical atomism had significant influence on the\ndevelopment of philosophy, especially in the first half of the 20th\ncentury.  Nowhere is Russell\u2019s influence more clearly seen than in the\nwork of his pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus appeared in 1921; in it, Wittgenstein\npresented in some detail a logical atomist metaphysics.  (It should be\nnoted, however, that there is significant controversy over whether, in\nthe end, Wittgenstein himself meant to endorse this metaphysics.)  In\nthe Tractatus, the world is described as consisting of\nfacts. The simplest facts, which Wittgenstein called\n\u201cSachverhalte\u201d, translated either as \u201cstates of affairs\u201d or\n\u201catomic facts\u201d, are thought of as conglomerations of objects combined\nwith a definite structure. The objects making up these atomic basics\nwere described as absolutely simple. Elementary propositions are\npropositions whose truth depends entirely on the presence of an atomic\nfact, and other propositions have a determinate and unique analysis in\nwhich they can be construed as built up from elementary propositions in\ntruth-functional ways. \n\n \nPartly owing to Wittgenstein\u2019s influence, partly directly, Russell\u2019s\nlogical atomism had significant influence on the works of the logical\npositivist tradition, as exemplified in the works of Carnap, Waismann,\nHempel and Ayer.  This tradition usually disavowed metaphysical\nprinciples, but methodologically their philosophies owed much to\nRussell\u2019s approach. Carnap, for example, described philosophy as\ntaking the form of providing \u201cthe logical analysis of the language of\nscience\u201d (Carnap 1934, 61). This originally took the form of\nattempting to show that all meaningful scientific discourse could be\nanalyzed in terms of logical combinations beginning with \u201cprotocol\nsentences\u201d, or sentences directly confirmable or disconfirmable by\nexperience.  This notion of a \u201cprotocol sentence\u201d in this tradition\nwas originally modeled after Russellian and Wittgensteinian atomic\npropositions. The notion of a \u201clogical construction\u201d was also\nimportant for how such thinkers conceived of the nature of ordinary\nobjects (see, e.g., Ayer 1952, chap. 3). The view that scientific\nlanguage could readily and easily be analyzed directly in terms of\nobservables gradually gave way to more holistic views, such as Quine\u2019s\n(see, e.g. Quine 1951), in which it is claimed that it is only a body\nof scientific theories that can be compared to experience, and not\nisolated sentences.  However, even in later works growing out of this\ntradition, the influence of Russell can be felt.\n\n \nBesides positive influence, many trends in 20th century philosophy can\nbe best understood largely as a reaction to Russell\u2019s atomistic\nphilosophy. Ironically, nowhere is this more true than in the later\nwritings of Wittgenstein, especially his Philosophical\nInvestigations (1953). Among other things, Wittgenstein there\ncalled into question whether a single, unequivocal notion of\nsimplicity or a final state of analysis can be found (e.g.,\nsecs. 46\u201349, 91), and questioned the utility of an ideal language\n(sec. 81). Wittgenstein also called into question whether, in those\ncases in which analysis is possible, the results really give us what\nwas meant at the start: \u201cdoes someone who says that the broom is in\nthe corner really mean: the broomstick is there, and so is the brush,\nand the broomstick is fixed in the brush?\u201d (sec. 60). Much of the work\nof the so-called \u201cordinary language\u201d school of philosophy centered in\nOxford in the 1940s and 1950s can also been seen largely as a critical\nresponse to views of Russell (see, e.g., Austin 1962, Warnock 1951,\nUrmson 1956). \n\n \nNevertheless, despite the criticisms, many so-called \u201canalytic\u201d\nphilosophers still believe that the notion of analysis has some role\nto play in philosophical methodology, though there seems to be no\nconsensus regarding precisely what analysis consists in, and to what\nextent it leads reliably to metaphysically significant\nresults. Debates regarding the nature of simple entities, their\ninterrelations or dependencies between one another, and whether there\nare any such entities, are still alive and well.  Russell\u2019s rejection\nof idealistic monism, and his arguments in favor of a pluralistic\nuniverse, have gained almost universal acceptance, with a few\nexceptions. Abstracting away from Russell\u2019s particular examples of\nproposed analyses in terms of sensible particulars, the general\nframework of Russell\u2019s atomistic picture of the world, which consists\nof a plurality of entities that have qualities and enter into\nrelations, remains one to which many contemporary philosophers are\nattracted.\n",
