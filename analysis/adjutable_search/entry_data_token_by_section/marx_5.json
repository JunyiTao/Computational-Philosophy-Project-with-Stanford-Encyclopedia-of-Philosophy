    "main_text": "Alienation and Human Flourishing || Religion and Work\n2.2 Religion and Work\n\nMarx\u2019s ideas concerning alienation were greatly influenced by\nthe critical writings on religion of Ludwig Feuerbach\n(1804\u20131872), and especially his The Essence of\nChristianity (1841). One key text in this respect is Marx\u2019s\n\u201cContribution of Hegel\u2019s Critique of Right:\nIntroduction\u201d (1843). This work is home to Marx\u2019s\nnotorious remark that religion is the \u201copium of the\npeople,\u201d a harmful, illusion-generating painkiller\n(MECW 3: 175). It is here that Marx sets out his account of\nreligion in most detail.\n\nWhile traditional Christian theology asserts that God created man in\nGod\u2019s own image, Marx fully accepted Feuerbach\u2019s inversion\nof this picture, proposing that human beings had invented God in their\nown image; indeed a view that long pre-dated Feuerbach.\nFeuerbach\u2019s distinctive contribution was to argue that\nworshipping God diverted human beings from enjoying their own human\npowers. In their imagination humans raise their own powers to an\ninfinite level and project them on to an abstract object. Hence\nreligion is a form of alienation, for it separates human beings from\ntheir \u201cspecies essence.\u201d Marx accepted much of\nFeuerbach\u2019s account but argues that Feuerbach failed to\nunderstand why people fall into religious alienation, and so is unable\nto explain how it can be transcended. Feuerbach\u2019s view appears\nto be that belief in religion is purely an intellectual error and can\nbe corrected by persuasion. Marx\u2019s explanation is that religion\nis a response to alienation in material life, and therefore cannot be\nremoved until human material life is emancipated, at which point\nreligion will wither away.\n\nPrecisely what it is about material life that creates religion is not\nset out with complete clarity. However, it seems that at least two\naspects of alienation are responsible. One is alienated labour, which\nwill be explored shortly. A second is the need for human beings to\nassert their communal essence. Whether or not we explicitly recognise\nit, human beings exist as a community, and what makes human life\npossible is our mutual dependence on the vast network of social and\neconomic relations which engulf us all, even though this is rarely\nacknowledged in our day-to-day life. Marx\u2019s view appears to be\nthat we must, somehow or other, acknowledge our communal existence in\nour institutions. At first it is \u201cdeviously acknowledged\u201d\nby religion, which creates a false idea of a community in which we are\nall equal in the eyes of God. After the post-Reformation fragmentation\nof religion, where religion is no longer able to play the role even of\na fake community of equals, the modern state fills this need by\noffering us the illusion of a community of citizens, all equal in the\neyes of the law. Interestingly, the political or liberal state, which\nis needed to manage the politics of religious diversity, takes on the\nrole offered by religion in earlier times of providing a form of\nillusory community. But the political state and religion will both be\ntranscended when a genuine community of social and economic equals is\ncreated.\n\nAlthough Marx was greatly inspired by thinking about religious\nalienation, much more of his attention was devoted to exploring\nalienation in work. In a much-discussed passage from the 1844\nManuscripts, Marx identifies four dimensions of alienated labour\nin contemporary capitalist society (MECW 3: 270\u2013282).\nFirst, immediate producers are separated from the product of their\nlabour; they create a product that they neither own nor control,\nindeed, which comes to dominate them. (Note that this idea of\n\u201cfetishism\u201d\u2014where human creations escape our\ncontrol, achieve the appearance of independence, and come to oppress\nus\u2014is not to be equated with alienation as such, but is rather\none form that it can take.) Second, immediate producers are separated\nfrom their productive activity; in particular, they are forced to work\nin ways which are mentally and/or physically debilitating. Third,\nimmediate producers are separated from other individuals; contemporary\neconomic relations socialise individuals to view others as merely\nmeans to their own particular ends. Fourth, and finally, immediate\nproducers are separated from their own human nature; for instance, the\nhuman capacities for community and for free, conscious, and creative,\nwork, are both frustrated by contemporary capitalist relations.\n\nNote that these claims about alienation are distinct from other,\nperhaps more familiar, complaints about work in capitalist society.\nFor instance, alienated labour, as understood here, could\nbe\u2014even if it is often not\u2014highly remunerated, limited in\nduration, and relatively secure.\n\nMarx holds that work has the potential to be something creative and\nfulfilling. He consequently rejects the view of work as a necessary\nevil, denying that the negative character of work is part of our fate,\na universal fact about the human condition that no amount of social\nchange could remedy. Indeed, productive activity, on Marx\u2019s\naccount, is a central element in what it is to be a human being, and\nself-realisation through work is a vital component of human\nflourishing. That he thinks that work\u2014in a different form of\nsociety\u2014could be creative and fulfilling, perhaps explains the\nintensity and scale of Marx\u2019s condemnation of contemporary\neconomic arrangements and their transformation of workers into\ndeformed and \u201cdehumanised\u201d beings (MECW 3:\n284).\n\nIt was suggested above that alienation consists of dysfunctional\nseparations\u2014separations between entities that properly belong\ntogether\u2014and that theories of alienation typically presuppose\nsome baseline condition whose frustration or violation by the relevant\nseparation identifies the latter as dysfunctional. For Marx, that\nbaseline seems to be provided by an account of human flourishing,\nwhich he conceptualises in terms of self-realisation (understood here\nas the development and deployment of our essential human capacities).\nLabour in capitalism, we can say, is alienated because it embodies\nseparations preventing the self-realisation of producers; because it\nis organised in a way that frustrates the human need for free,\nconscious, and creative work.\n\nSo understood, and returning to the four separations said to\ncharacterise alienated labour, we can see that it is the implicit\nclaim about human nature (the fourth separation) which identifies the\nother three separations as dysfunctional. If one subscribed to the\nsame formal model of alienation and self-realisation, but held a\ndifferent account of the substance of human nature, very different\nclaims about work in capitalist society might result. Imagine a\ntheorist who held that human beings were solitary, egoistic creatures,\nby nature. That theorist could accept that work in capitalist society\nencouraged isolation and selfishness, but deny that such results were\nalienating, because those results would not frustrate their baseline\naccount of what it is to be a human being (indeed, they would rather\nfacilitate those characteristics).\n",
