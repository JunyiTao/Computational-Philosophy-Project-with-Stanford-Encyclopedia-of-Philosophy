    "main_text": "The History in Letters and Macaulay as a critic of Burke || Response to Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents\n3.1 Response to Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents\n\nBurke\u2019s pamphlet was prompted by two proposed pieces of legislation,\nwhich he argued would, if passed, have undermined the independence of\nParliament. One, a consequence of the controversy concerning Wilkes,\nwould have allowed Parliament to expel any of its members at its\npleasure. The other committed the Parliament to paying the debts\naccumulated in the Civil List. These bills, he suggested \u201cmust\nestablish such a fund of rewards and terrors as will make Parliament\nthe best appendage and support of arbitrary power that ever was\ninvented by the wit of man\u201d (Burke 1770, 94). He looks back with\nsome nostalgia to the time of Queen Anne, when the Whig party had\ncontrol of the parliament, and argues that it is only through the\npower of parties, grounded in aristocratic influence, that the\nparliament can exercise an effective control over the executive (Burke\n1770, 109). Macaulay does not disagree with Burkes\u2019 analysis of the\ncontemporary situation, nor that the increasing dominance of the court\nwas in effect making parliament a tool of court policy, but she rounds\non Burke for his inadequate analysis of the causes of the contemporary\nstate of affairs. It was in fact the aristocratic factions, jostling\nfor power, which had enabled the court to deprive the parliament of\neffective means of controlling the monarch. The Whigs had played a\nmore destructive role in this process than the Tories, because they\nhad concealed their desire for power under the rhetoric of\nliberty.\n\n\nA system of corruption began at the very period of the Revolution, and\ngrowing from its nature with increasing vigor, was the policy of every\nsucceeding administration. To share the plunder of a credulous people,\ncabals were formed between the representatives and the ministers.\nParliament, the great barrier of our much boasted constitution, while\nit preserved its forms, annihilated its spirit; and, from a\ncontrouling power over the executive parts of government, became a\nmere instrument of regal administration. (Macaulay 1770, 13)\n\n\nWhat is required, according to Macaulay, in order to restore some\nindependence and authority to parliament, is triennial elections, in\nplace of the septennial ones, which had been brought in during\nWilliam\u2019s reign, and which placed parliamentarians in a position to\naccumulate too much power of patronage, as well as \u201ca more\nextended and equal power of election\u201d (Macaulay 1770, 28).\n",
