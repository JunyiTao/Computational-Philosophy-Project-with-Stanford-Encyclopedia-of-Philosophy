    "main_text": "Fifth Case Study: Social Epistemology || The Zollman Effect\n5.1 The Zollman Effect\n\nImagine there are two treatments for some medical condition. One\ntreatment is old, and its efficacy is well known: it has a .5 chance\nof curing the condition in any given case. The other treatment is new,\nand might be slightly better or slightly worse: a .501 chance of\nsuccess, or else .499. Researchers aren\u2019t sure yet which it\nis.\n\nAt present, some doctors are wary of the new treatment, others are\nmore optimistic. So some try it on their patients while others stick\nto the old ways. As it happens the optimists are right: the new\ntreatment is superior: it has a .501 chance of success.\n\nSo, will the new treatment\u2019s superiority eventually emerge as a\nconsensus within the community? As data on its performance are\ngathered and shared, shouldn\u2019t it become clear over time that\nthe new treatment is slightly better?\n\nNot necessarily. It\u2019s possible that those trying the new\ntreatment will hit a string of bad luck. Initial studies may get a run\nof less-than-stellar results, which don\u2019t accurately reflect the\nnew treatment\u2019s superiority. After all, it\u2019s only slightly\nbetter than the traditional treatment. So it might not show its mettle\nright away. And if it doesn\u2019t, the optimists may abandon it\nbefore it has a chance to prove itself.\n\nOne way to mitigate this danger is to limit the flow of information in\nthe medical community. Following Zollman (2007), let\u2019s\ndemonstrate this by simulation.\n\nWe\u2019ll create a network of \u201cdoctors,\u201d each with their\nown initial credence that the new treatment is superior. Those with\ncredence above .5 will try the new treatment, others will stick to the\nold one. Doctors connected by a line share their results with each\nother, and everyone then updates on whatever results they see using\nBayes\u2019 theorem (\u00a71.2.2).\n\nWe\u2019ll consider networks of different sizes, from 3 to 10\ndoctors. And we\u2019ll try three different network\n\u201cshapes,\u201d either a complete network, a wheel, or a\ncycle:\n\n\nThree network configurations, illustrated here with 6 doctors each\n\n\nOur conjecture is that the cycle will prove most reliable. A doctor\nwho gets an unlucky string of misleading results will do the least\ndamage there. Sharing their results might discourage their two\nneighbours from learning the truth. But the others in the network may\nkeep investigating, and ultimately learn the truth about the new\ntreatment\u2019s superiority. The wheel should be more vulnerable to\naccidental misinformation, however, and the complete network most\nvulnerable.\n\nHere are the details. Initially, each doctor is assigned a random\ncredence that the new treatment is superior, chosen uniformly from the\n[0, 1] interval. Those with credence above .5 will then try the new\ntreatment on 1,000 patients. The number of successes will be randomly\ndetermined by performing 1,000 \u201cflips\u201d of a virtual coin\nwith probability .501 of heads (successful treatment).\n\nEach doctor then shares their results with their neighbours, and\nupdates by Bayes\u2019 theorem on all data available to them. Then we\ndo another round of experimenting, sharing, and updating, followed by\nanother, and so on until the community reaches a consensus.\n\nConsensus can be achieved in either of two ways. Either everyone\nlearns the truth, that the new treatment is superior, by achieving\nhigh credence in it (above .99 we\u2019ll say). Alternatively,\neveryone might reach credence .5 or lower in the new treatment. Then\nno one experiments with it further, so it\u2019s impossible for it to\nmake a comeback.\n\nHere\u2019s what happens when we run each simulation 10,000 times.\nBoth the shape of the network and the number of doctors affect how\noften the community finds the truth. The first factor is the Zollman\neffect: the less connected the network, the more likely they\u2019ll\nfind the truth.\n\n\nProbability of discovering the truth\ndepends on network configuration and number of doctors.\n\n\nBut notice that a bigger community is more likely to find the truth\ntoo. Why? Because bigger, less connected networks are better insulated\nagainst misleading results. Some doctors are bound to get data that\ndon\u2019t reflect the true character of the new treatment once in a\nwhile. And when that happens, their misleading results risk polluting\nthe community with misinformation, discouraging others from\nexperimenting with the new treatment. But the more people in the\nnetwork, the more likely the misleading results will be swamped by\naccurate, representative results from others. And the fewer people see\nthe misleading results, the fewer people will be misled.\n\nHere\u2019s an animated pair of simulations to illustrate the first\neffect. Here I\u2019ve set the six doctors\u2019 starting credences\nto the same, even spread in both networks: .3, .4, .5, .6, .7, and .8.\nI also gave them the same sequence of random data. Only the\nconnections in the networks are different, and in this case it makes\nall the difference. Only the cycle learns the truth. The complete\nnetwork goes dark very early, abandoning the novel treatment entirely\nafter just 26 iterations.\n\n\nTwo networks with identical priors encounter\n identical evidence, but only one discovers the truth.\n [Alternative link to video]\n\n\nWhat saves the cycle network is the doctor who starts with .8 credence\n(bottom left). They start out optimistic enough to keep going after\nthe group encounters an initial string of dismaying results. In the\ncomplete network, however, they receive so much negative evidence\nearly on that they give up almost right away. Their optimism is\noverwhelmed by the negative findings of their many neighbours. Whereas\nthe cycle exposes them to less of this discouraging evidence, giving\nthem time to keep experimenting with the novel treatment, ultimately\nwinning over their neighbours.\n\nAs Rosenstock, Bruner, and O\u2019Connor (2017) put it: sometimes\nless is more, when it comes to sharing the results of scientific\ninquiry. But how important is this effect? How often is it present,\nand is it big enough to worry about in actual practice?\n\nRosenstock, Bruner, and O\u2019Connor argue that the Zollman effect\nonly afflicts epistemically \u201chard\u201d problems. It\u2019s\nonly because the difference between our two treatments is so hard to\ndiscern from the data that the Zollman effect is a concern. If the new\ntreatment were much more noticeably superior to the old one, say a .7\nchance of success rather than the .501 we imagined above,\nwouldn\u2019t there be little chance of its superiority going\nunnoticed?\n\nSo Rosenstock, Bruner, and O\u2019Connor rerun the simulations with\ndifferent values for \u201cepsilon,\u201d the increase in\nprobability of success afforded by the new treatment. Before we held\nepsilon fixed at .001 = .501 \u2212 .5. But now we\u2019ll let it\nvary up to .1. For simplicity we\u2019ll only consider a complete\nnetwork versus a cycle this time, and we\u2019ll hold the number of\ndoctors fixed at 10. (The number of trials each round continues to be\n1,000.)\n\n\nThe Zollman effect vanishes as the difference in efficacy between the two treatments increases\n\n\n\nObserve how the Zollman effect shrinks as epsilon grows. In fact\nit\u2019s only visible up to about .025 in these simulations.\n\nRosenstock, Bruner, and O\u2019Connor also run other variations to\nshow that if our medical community is much larger, or if each doctor\ngathers a much larger sample before sharing, the Zollman effect\nvanishes. It becomes very unlikely that an unrepresentative sample\nwill arise and discourage the whole community. So there\u2019s no\nreal harm in sharing data freely.\n\nA natural question then is: how often do real-world research\ncommunities face the kind of \u201chard\u201d problem where the\nZollman effect is a real concern? Rosenstock, Bruner, and\nO\u2019Connor acknowledge that some laboratory experiments have found\nsimilar effects, where limiting communication between subjects leads\nto improved epistemic outcomes. But they also stress that the Zollman\neffect is not \u201crobust,\u201d requiring fairly specific\ncircumstances to arise (small epsilon, a small research community, and\nnot-too-large sample sizes). Since the above model is both simple and\nidealized, this lack of robustness should give us pause, they argue,\nabout its likely applicability in real-world scenarios.\n",
