    "preamble": "\n\nBehind the various Christian ideas about heaven and hell lies the more\nbasic belief that our lives extend beyond the grave (see the entry on\n afterlife).\n For suppose that our lives do not extend beyond the grave. In\naddition to excluding a variety of ideas about reincarnation and\nkarma, this would also preclude the very possibility of future\ncompensation of any kind for those who experience horrendous\nevil during their earthly lives. Indeed, despite their profound\ndifferences, many Christians (though perhaps not all) and many\natheists can presumably agree on one thing at least. If a young girl\nshould be brutally raped and murdered and this should be the end of\nthe story for the child, then a supremely powerful, benevolent, and\njust God would not exist. An atheist may seriously doubt whether\nany future compensation would suffice to justify a supreme\nbeing\u2019s decision to permit such an evil in the first place. But\nthe point is that even many Christians would concede that, apart from\nan afterlife, such an evil would constitute overwhelming evidence\nagainst the existence of God; some might even concede that such an\nevil would be logically (or metaphysically) inconsistent with\nGod\u2019s existence as well.\n\nIt is hardly surprising, then, that a belief in an afterlife should be\nan important part of the Christian tradition. Even if our lives do\nextend beyond the grave, however, the question remains concerning the\nnature of the future in store for us on the other side, and the\nvarious Christian views about heaven and hell are proposed answers to\nthis question. According to a relatively common view in the wider\nChristian culture, heaven and hell are essentially deserved\ncompensations for the kind of earthly lives we live. Good people go to\nheaven as a deserved reward for a virtuous life, and bad people go to\nhell as a just punishment for an immoral life; in that way, the scales\nof justice are sometimes thought to balance. But virtually all\nChristian theologians regard such a view, however common it may be in\nthe popular culture, as overly simplistic and unsophisticated; the\nbiblical perspective, as they see it, is far more subtly nuanced than\nthat.\n\nWhen we turn to the theological and philosophical literature in the\nChristian tradition, we encounter, as we would in any of the other\ngreat religious traditions as well, a bewildering variety of different\n(and often inconsistent) theological views. The views about hell in\nparticular include very different conceptions of divine love, divine\njustice, and divine grace, very different ideas about free will and\nits role (if any) in determining a person\u2019s ultimate destiny,\nvery different understandings of moral evil and the purpose of\npunishment, and very different views about the nature of moral\nresponsibility and the possibility of inherited guilt. There is also\nthis further complication: in the Abrahamic family of monotheistic\nreligions to which Christianity belongs (along with Judaism and\nIslam), theological reflection often includes an interpretation of\nvarious texts thought to be both sacred and authoritative. But the\nmeaning of these texts, particularly when read in their original\nlanguages, is rarely transparent to all reasonable interpreters; that\nis, not even all who regard a relevant text as authoritative seem able\nto agree on its correct interpretation. Still, despite this\nbewildering diversity of theological opinion, there may be a\nrelatively easy way to identify three primary eschatological views\nwithin the Christian religion and thus to organize the various ideas\nabout heaven and hell around these three primary views.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Three Primary Eschatological Views\n\nLet theism in general be the belief that a supremely\npowerful, supremely wise, and supremely good (loving, just, merciful)\npersonal being exists as the Creator of the universe. Christian\ntheism is, of course, more specific than that, and Christian\ntheists typically make the following two-fold assumption: first, that\nthe highest possible good for created persons (true blessedness, if\nyou will) requires that they enter into a proper relationship (or even\na kind of union) with their Creator, and second, that a complete\nseverance from the divine nature, without even an implicit experience\nof God (see\n note 11)\n would be a terrifying evil. As C. S. Lewis once put it, union with\nthe divine \u201cNature is bliss and separation from it [an\nobjective] horror\u201d (1955, 232). Although most Christians would\nprobably agree with this, some may want additional clarity on the\nnature of the union and the separation in question here. But in any\ncase, whereas heaven is in general thought of as a realm in which\npeople experience the bliss of perfect fellowship and harmony with God\nand with each other, hell is in general thought of as a realm in which\npeople experience the greatest possible estrangement from God, the\ngreatest possible sense of alienation, and perhaps also an intense\nhatred of everyone including themselves.\n\nThe ideas of heaven and hell are also closely associated with the\nreligious idea of salvation, which in turn rests upon a\ntheological interpretation of the human condition. Even the\nnon-religious can perhaps agree that, for whatever reason, we humans\nbegin our earthly lives with many imperfections and with no\n(conscious) awareness of God. We also emerge and begin making choices\nin a context of ambiguity, ignorance, and misperception, and behind\nour earliest choices lie a host of genetically determined inclinations\nand environmental (including social and cultural) influences. As young\nchildren, moreover, we initially pursue our own needs and interests as\nwe perceive (or misperceive) them. So the context in which we humans\nemerge with a first person perspective and then begin developing into\nminimally rational agents virtually guarantees, it seems, that we\nwould repeatedly misconstrue our own interests and pursue them in\nmisguided ways; it also includes many sources of misery, at least some\nof which\u2014the horror of war, horrifying examples of inhumanity to\nchildren, people striving to benefit themselves at the expense of\nothers, etc.\u2014are the product of misguided human choices. But\nother sources include such non-moral evils as natural disasters,\nsickness, and especially physical death itself.\n\nClearly, then, we all encounter in our natural environment many\nthreats to our immediate welfare and many obstacles, some of our own\nmaking and some not, to enduring happiness. The Christian\ninterpretation of this human condition thus postulates an initial\nestrangement from God, and the Christian religion then offers a\nprescription for how we can be saved from such estrangement; it\nteaches in particular that \u201cGod was in Christ, reconciling the\nworld unto himself\u201d (2 Cor. 5:19a\u2014KJV). But Christians\nalso disagree among themselves concerning the extent and ultimate\nsuccess of God\u2019s saving activity among human beings. Some\nbelieve that God will positively reject unrepentant sinners after a\ngiven deadline, typically thought of as the moment of physical death,\nand actively punish them forever after; others believe that God would\nnever reject any of God\u2019s own loved ones even though some of\nthem may freely reject God forever, thereby placing themselves in a\nkind of self-created hell; and still others believe that God\u2019s\nredemptive love will triumph in the end and will successfully bring\nreconciliation to all of those whom God has loved into existence in\nthe first place. So one way to organize our thinking here is against\nthe backdrop of the following inconsistent set of three\npropositions:\n\nAll human sinners are equal objects of God\u2019s\nredemptive love in the sense that God wills or aims to win over each\none of them over time and thereby to prepare each one of them for the\nbliss of union with the divine nature.\nGod\u2019s redemptive love will triumph in the end and\nsuccessfully win over each and every object of that love, thereby\npreparing each one of them for the bliss of union with the divine\nnature.\nSome human sinners will never be reconciled to God and will\ntherefore remain separated from the divine nature forever.\n\n\nIf this set of propositions is logically inconsistent, as it surely\nis, then at least one proposition in the set is false. In no way does\nit follow, of course, that only one proposition in the set is\nfalse, and neither does it follow that at least two of them are true.\nBut if someone does accept any two of these propositions, as virtually\nevery mainline Christian theologian does, then such a person has no\nchoice but to reject the\n third.[1]\n It is typically rather easy, moreover, to determine which proposition\na given theologian ultimately rejects, and we can therefore classify\ntheologians according to which of these propositions they do reject.\nSo that leaves exactly three primary eschatological views. Because the\nAugustinians, named after St. Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430),\nbelieve both that God\u2019s redemptive (or electing) love will\ntriumph in the end (proposition (2)) and that some human sinners will\nnever be reconciled to God (proposition (3)), they finally reject the\nidea that God\u2019s redemptive love extends to all human sinners\nequally (proposition (1)); because the Arminians, named after Jacobus\nArminius (1560\u20131609) for his opposition to the Augustinian\nunderstanding of limited election, believe both that God\u2019s\nredemptive love extends to all human sinners equally (proposition (1))\nand that some of these sinners will never be reconciled to God\n(proposition (3)), they finally reject the idea that God\u2019s\nredemptive love will triumph in the end (proposition (2)); and\nfinally, because the Christian universalists believe both that\nGod\u2019s redemptive love extends to all human sinners equally\n(proposition (1)) and that this love will triumph in the end\n(proposition (2)), they finally reject altogether the idea that some\nhuman sinners will never be reconciled to God (proposition (3)). \n\nSo here, then, are three quite different systems of theology.\nAccording to Augustinian theology, God\u2019s redemptive love cannot\nbe thwarted forever, but the scope of that love is restricted to a\nlimited elect. According to Arminian theology, God\u2019s redemptive\nlove extends to all human sinners equally, but that love can be\nthwarted by factors, such as certain human choices, over which God has\nno direct causal control. And according to the theology of Christian\nuniversalism, God\u2019s redemptive love extends to all human sinners\nequally and God\u2019s will to save each one of them cannot be\nthwarted forever. Accordingly, a question that may now arise is,\n\u201cWhich system of theology best preserves the praiseworthy\ncharacter and the glory of God?\u201d\n1.1 Postulating a Final and Irreversible Division within the Human Race\n\nSome may already have observed that the third proposition in our\ninconsistent triad, namely\n\nSome humans will never be reconciled to God and will therefore\nremain separated from the divine nature forever,\n\n\nis fairly unspecific concerning the fate of the wicked and the import\nof separation from God. For if we think of such separation as a state\nof being estranged or alienated from God, or if we think of it as\nsimply the absence of a loving union with God, then (3) is equally\nconsistent with many different conceptions of hell, some arguably\nmilder than others. It is equally consistent, for example, with the\nidea that hell is a realm where the wicked receive retribution in the\nform of everlasting torment, with the idea that they will simply be\nannihilated in the end, with the idea that they create their own hell\nby rejecting God, and with the idea that God will simply make them as\ncomfortable as possible in hell even as God graciously limits the harm\nthey can do to each other (see Stump 1986). This lack of specificity\nis by design. For however one understands the fate of those who\nsupposedly remain separated from God forever, such a fate\nwill entail something like (3). Alternatively, anyone who rejects (3)\nwill likewise reject the idea of everlasting torment as well as any of\nthe supposedly milder conceptions of an everlasting separation from\nGod.\n\nNow when the Fifth General Council of the Christian church condemned\nthe doctrine of universal reconciliation in 553 CE, it did not,\nstrictly speaking, commit the institutional church of that day to a\ndoctrine of everlasting conscious torment in hell. But it did commit\nthe church to a final and irreversible division within the human race\nbetween those who will be saved, on the one hand, and those who will\nbe hopelessly lost forever, on the other. So anyone who accepted the\nCouncil\u2019s decision on this point, as most major theologians over\nthe subsequent thousand years did, inevitably confronted an obvious\nquestion. If there is to be such a final and irreversible division\nwithin the human race, just what accounts for it? According to the\nAugustinians, the explanation lies in the mystery of God\u2019s\nfreedom to extend the divine love and mercy to a limited elect and to\nwithhold it from the rest of humanity; but according to the Arminians,\nthe explanation lies in our human free choices. Thanks to God\u2019s\ngrace, we ultimately determine our own destiny in heaven or\nhell. \n\nThese two very different explanations for a final and irrevocable\ndivision within the human race, where some end up in heaven and others\nin hell, also reflect profound disagreements over the nature of divine\ngrace. Because the Augustinians hold that, in our present condition at\nleast, God owes us nothing, they also believe that the grace God\nconfers upon a limited elect is utterly gratuitous and supererogatory.\nAs John Calvin put it, \u201cFor as Jacob, deserving nothing by good\nworks, is taken into grace, Esau, as yet undefiled by any crime, is\nhated\u201d (Calvin 1960, Bk. III, Ch. XXIII, sec. 12). But the\nArminians reject such a doctrine as inherently unjust; it is simply\nunjust, they insist, for God to do for some, namely the elect, what\nGod refuses to do for others, particularly since the elect have done\nnothing to deserve their special treatment. The Arminians therefore\nhold that God offers his grace to all human beings, though\nmany are those who freely reject it and eventually seal their fate in\nhell forever. But for their part, the Augustinians counter that this\nArminian explanation in terms of human free will contradicts St.\nPaul\u2019s clear teaching that salvation is wholly a matter of\ngrace: \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith,\u201d\nPaul declared, \u201cand this [the faith] is not your own doing; it\nis the gift of God\u2014not the result of works, so that no one may\nboast\u201d (Eph. 2:8\u20139). The Augustinians also challenge the\nArminians with the following question: if the ultimate difference\nbetween the saved and the lost lies in the superior free choices that\nthe saved have made during their earthly lives, then why\nshouldn\u2019t they take credit for this difference or even boast\nabout it? Why shouldn\u2019t they say, \u201cWell, at least\nI\u2019m not as bad as those miserable people in hell who were so\nstupid as to have freely rejected the grace that God offers to\nall.\u201d\n\nA Christian universalist, of course, might insist that the\nAugustinians and the Arminians are both right in their respective\ncriticisms of each other.\n1.2 Restricting the Scope of God\u2019s Love\n\nWe have seen so far that the Augustinians in effect reason as follows:\nGod\u2019s saving grace is irresistible in the end, and yet\neverlasting torment in hell will nonetheless be the terrible fate for\nsome; therefore, God does not love all created persons equally and his\n(electing) love is thus limited in its scope. Augustine\u2019s own\ninterpretation of 1 Timothy 2:4 provides a nice illustration. He\nwrote: \u201cthe word concerning God, \u2018who will have all men to\nbe saved,\u2019 does not mean that there is no one whose salvation he\n[God] doth not will \u2026 but by \u2018all men\u2019 we are to\nunderstand the whole of mankind, in every single group into which it\ncan be divided \u2026 For from which of these groups doth not God\nwill that some men from every nation should be saved through\nhis only-begotten Son our Lord?\u201d (Enchiridion,\n103\u2014italics added).\n\nSo it is not God\u2019s will, Augustine claimed, to save every\nindividual from every group and every nation; it is merely God\u2019s\nwill to save all kinds of people, that is, some individuals\nfrom every group and every nation. Augustine\u2019s exegetical\narguments for such an interpretation, however fantastic they may\nappear to non-Augustinians, need not concern us here. More important\nfor our purposes is his pattern of argument, as illustrated in the\nfollowing comment: \u201cWe could interpret it [1 Tim. 2:4] in any\nother fashion, as long as we are not compelled to believe that the\nOmnipotent hath willed something to be done which was not\ndone\u201d\u2014and as long as we are not compelled to believe, he\nno doubt took for granted, that no one will be eternally damned. For\nif propositions (2) and (3) are both true, then proposition\n(1) is false and the scope of God\u2019s love is restricted to a\nlimited elect. It is as simple as that.\n\nNor should one suppose that this Augustinian understanding of limited\nelection is totally bereft of contemporary defenders. One such\ncontemporary defender, the Christian philosopher Paul Helm, has argued\nthat God\u2019s loving nature no more necessitates that God extend a\nredemptive love equally to all humans than it necessitates that God\ncreate them all with the same human characteristics. For why is it,\nHelm asks, \u201cthat some are strong, some weak, some male, some\nfemale, some healthy, some diseased, and so forth?\u201d He then\nmakes the following claim: \u201cif it is possible for there to be\ndifferentiations in the created universe that are consistent with the\nattributes of God then it is presumably possible for there to be\ndifferentiations with regard to God\u2019s redemptive purposes which\nare entirely consistent with the divine attributes\u201d (Helm 1985,\n53). How one evaluates such a claim will no doubt depend, at least in\npart, upon how one answers such questions as these: Would God\u2019s\nwilling that one person have black hair and another brown hair be\ncompatible with loving both of them equally and with acting justly\ntoward both of them? Would God\u2019s willing that one person should\ncome to a glorious end and another to a horrific end be compatible\nwith loving both of them equally and with acting justly toward both of\nthem?\n\nIn response to similar questions, Jeff Jordan has challenged the whole\nidea, which he acknowledges to be widely accepted among theistic\nphilosophers, that \u201cGod\u2019s love must be maximally extended\nand equally intense\u201d (Jordan 2012, 53). According to Jordan,\nsuch maximally extended love would be a deficiency in any human who\nmanifested it; hence, it should not be numbered among God\u2019s\nperfections or great-making properties. Neither is it possible, he\nappears to argue, that God should love equally each and every created\nperson. For \u201cif God has deep attachments [with some of them], it\nfollows that he does not love all [of them] equally. And being a\nperfect being, God would have loves of the deepest kind\u201d (Jordan\n2012, 67). Jordan thus asks in a later article, \u201cWhat if ... it\nis not possible in-principle [even for God] to love every person\nuniformly to the same degree?\u201d And in support of his contention\nthat this is indeed impossible, Jordan argues, first, that people in\nfact have incompatible interests, second, that two \u201cinterests\nare incompatible just in case attempts to bring about one of them\nrequire that the other be impeded,\u201d and third, that love of the\ndeepest kind \u201chas as a necessary constituent identifying with\nthe interests of one\u2019s beloved\u201d (Jordan 2015, 184). \n\nTwo critical problems arise at this point. First, why suppose that the\ndeepest love for others (in the sense of willing the very best for\nthem) always requires identifying with their own interests? According\nto Jordan, a person\u2019s interest is merely \u201ca desire or goal\nhad by that person\u2014something that a person cares about\u201d\n(Jordan 2012, 62, n. 26; see also Jordan 2020, 83). But in that sense\nof \u201cinterest,\u201d God\u2019s deepest love for a person\nsurely requires that God actually oppose or impede some of that\nperson\u2019s interests. Why else would Christians believe, as the\nauthor of Hebrews put it, that God often \u201cdisciplines those whom\nhe loves and chastises every child whom he accepts\u201d? (Heb.\n12:6). And second, why suppose that God cannot identify with\nincompatible interests anyway? Indeed, why cannot a single individual\nidentify with incompatible interests (or conflicting desires) of his\nor her own? Jordan himself offers the following explanation of what it\nmeans to identify with an interest: \u201cIdentifying with an\ninterest we might understand as, roughly, caring about what\none\u2019s beloved cares about because one\u2019s beloved cares\nabout it\u201d (Jordan 2015, 184). But why, then, cannot a loving\nmother, for example, care deeply about the incompatible interests (or\nimmediate desires) of her two small children as they squabble over a\ntoy and care about these incompatible interests, however trivial they\nmight otherwise have seemed to her, precisely because her beloved\nchildren care about them? The impossibility of her satisfying\nsuch incompatible interests hardly entails the impossibility of her\nidentifying with them in the sense of caring deeply about\n them.[2]\n Accordingly, what a proponent of limited election needs at this point\nis to specify a clear sense of \u201cto identify with\u201d such\nthat (a) it is impossible for God to identify with incompatible\ninterests and (b) an equally deep love for all created persons would\nnonetheless require that God be able to identify with at least some of\ntheir incompatible interests. \n\nIn any case, the vast majority of Christian philosophers who have\naddressed the topic of hell in recent decades and have\npublished at least some of their work in the standard philosophical\njournals do accept proposition (1) and also reject, therefore, any\nhint of Augustinian limited election. However ephemeral and changeable\nsuch a consensus may be, the contemporary consensus does seem to be\nthat God\u2019s redemptive love extends to all humans equally (see,\nfor example, Buckareff and Plug 2005, Knight 1997, Kronen and Reitan\n2011, Kvanvig 1993, Murray 1998, Seymour 2000b, Stump 1983, Swinburne\n1983, and Walls 1998). For a more thorough examination and critique of\nJordan\u2019s specific arguments, see Parker 2013, and Talbott 2020;\nand for Jordan\u2019s reply to some of this criticism, see Jordan\n2015 and Jordan 2020, Ch. 5.\n2. The Augustinian Understanding of Hell\n\nBehind the Augustinian understanding of hell lies a commitment to a\nretributive theory of punishment, according to which the primary\npurpose of punishment is to satisfy the demands of justice or, as some\nmight say, to balance the scales of justice. And the Augustinian\ncommitment to such a theory is hardly surprising. For based upon his\ninterpretation of various New Testament texts, Augustine insisted that\nhell is a literal lake of fire in which the damned will experience the\nhorror of everlasting torment; they will experience, that is, the\nunbearable physical pain of literally being burned forever. The\nprimary purpose of such unending torment, according to Augustine, is\nnot correction, or deterrence, or even the protection of the innocent;\nnor did he make any claim for it except that it is fully deserved and\ntherefore just. As for how such torment could be even physically\npossible, Augustine insisted further that \u201cby a miracle of their\nmost omnipotent Creator, they [living creatures who are damned] can\nburn without being consumed, and suffer without dying\u201d (City\nof God, Bk. 21, Ch. 9). Such is the metaphysics of hell, as\nAugustine understood it.\n\nIt would be unfair, however, to imply that all Augustinians, as\nclassified above, accept Augustine\u2019s own understanding of an\neternal torture chamber. For many Augustinians view the agony of hell\nas essentially psychological and spiritual in nature, consisting of\nthe knowledge that every possibility for joy and happiness has been\nlost forever. Hell, as they see it, is thus a condition in which\nself-loathing, hatred of others, hopelessness, and infinite despair\nconsumes the soul like a metaphorical fire. Still, virtually all\nAugustinians agree with Jonathan Edwards concerning this: whatever the\nprecise nature of the suffering, \u201cIn hell God manifests his\nbeing and perfections only in hatred and wrath, and hatred without\nlove\u201d (Edwards 1738, 390). In fact, according to Edwards, the\ndamned never were an object of God\u2019s electing love in the first\nplace: \u201cThe saints in glory will know concerning the damned in\nhell, that God never loved them, but that he hates them, and [that\nthey] will be for ever hated of God\u201d (Edwards 1834, sec. III).\nSo why are Christians required to love even those whom God has always\nhated? Because, says Edwards, we have no way of knowing in this life\nwho is, and who is not, an object of God\u2019s eternal hatred.\n\u201cWe ought now to love all, and even wicked men\u201d because\n\u201cwe know not but that God loves them\u201d (sec. III). In the\nnext life, however, \u201cthe heavenly inhabitants will know that\n[the damned] \u2026 are the objects of God\u2019s eternal\nhatred\u201d (sec. II). Edwards and other Augustinians thus hold that\nthe damned differ from the saved in one respect only: even before the\ndamned were born, God had already freely chosen to exclude them from\nthe grace and the redemptive love that God lavishes upon on the\nelect.\n\nSo why, one may wonder at this point, do the Augustinians believe that\nanyone\u2014whether it be Judas Iscariot, Saul of Tarsus, or Adolph\nHitler\u2014actually deserves unending torment as a just recompense\nfor their sins? The typical Augustinian answer appeals to the\nseriousness or the heinous character of even the most minor offense\nagainst God. In Cur Deus Homo (or Why God Became\nMan), a classic statement of the substitution theory of\natonement, St. Anselm illustrated such an appeal with the following\nexample. Suppose that God were to forbid you to look in a certain\ndirection, even though it seemed to you that by doing so you could\npreserve the entire creation from destruction. If you were to disobey\nGod and to look in that forbidden direction, you would sin so gravely,\nAnselm declared, that you could never do anything to pay for that sin\nadequately. As a proponent of the retributive theory, Anselm first\ninsisted that \u201cGod demands satisfaction in proportion to the\nextent of the sin.\u201d He then went on to insist that \u201cyou do\nnot make satisfaction [for any sin] unless you pay something greater\nthan is that for whose sake [namely God\u2019s] you ought not to have\nsinned\u201d (Cur Deus Homo I, Ch. 21). Anselm\u2019s\nargument, then, appears to run as follows: Because God is infinitely\ngreat, the slightest offense against God is also infinitely serious;\nand if an offense is infinitely serious, then no suffering the sinner\nmight endure over a finite period of time could possibly pay for it.\nSo either the sinner does not pay for the sin at all, or the sinner\nmust pay for it by enduring everlasting suffering (or at least a\npermanent loss of happiness).\n\nBut what about those who never commit any offense against God at all,\nsuch as those who die in infancy or those who, because of severe brain\ndamage or some other factor, never develop into minimally rational\nagents? These too, according to Augustine, deserve to be condemned\nalong with the human race as a whole. \u201cFor \u2026 the whole\nhuman race,\u201d he insisted, \u201cwas condemned in its apostate\nhead by a divine judgment so just that even if not a single member of\nthe race [including, therefore, those who die in infancy] were ever\nsaved from it, no one could rail against God\u2019s justice\u201d\n(Enchiridion,\n 99).[3]\n Registering his agreement with Augustine, Calvin likewise wrote:\n\u201cHence, as Augustine says, whether a man is a guilty unbeliever\nor an innocent believer, he begets not innocent but guilty\nchildren, for he begets them from a corrupted nature\u201d (Calvin\n1536, Bk. II, Ch. I, sec. 7 \u2014italics added). Augustine and\nCalvin both believed, then, that God justly condemns some who die in\ninfancy; indeed, if their innocence required that God unite with them,\nthen the ground of their salvation would lie in themselves rather\nthan, as Augustine saw it, in God\u2019s own free decision to save\nthem from their inherited\n guilt.[4]\n With respect to the unborn twins Jacob and Esau, Augustine thus\nwrote: \u201cboth the twins were \u2018by nature children of\nwrath,\u2019 not because of any works of their own, but because they\nwere both bound in the fetters of damnation originally forged by\nAdam\u201d (Enchiridion, 98).\n\nAs these remarks illustrate, the Augustinian understanding of original\nsin implies that we are all born guilty of a heinous sin against God,\nand this inherited guilt relieves God of any responsibility for our\nspiritual welfare. In Augustine\u2019s own words, \u201cNow it is\nclear that the one sin originally inherited, even if it were the\nonly one involved, makes men liable to condemnation\u201d\n(Enchiridion, 50\u2014italics added). Augustine thus\nconcluded that God can freely decide whom to save and whom to damn\nwithout committing any injustice at all. \u201cNow, who but a\nfool,\u201d he declared, \u201cwould think God unfair either when he\nimposes penal judgment on the deserving or when he shows mercy to the\nundeserving\u201d (Enchiridion, 98). For the Augustinians, then, the\nbottom line is that, even as our Creator, God owes us nothing in our\npresent condition because, thanks to original sin, we come into this\nearthly life already deserving nothing but everlasting punishment in\nhell as a just recompense for original sin.\n\nAlthough this Augustinian rationale for the justice of hell has had a\nprofound influence on the Western theological tradition, particularly\nin the past, critics of Augustinian theology, both ancient and\ncontemporary, have raised a number of powerful objections to it.\n2.1 Retributivist Objections\n\nOne set of objections arises from within the retributive theory\nitself, and here are three such objections that critics have raised.\nFirst, why should the greatness of the one against whom an\noffense occurs determine the degree of one\u2019s personal\nguilt anyway? According to most proponents of the retributive\ntheory, the personal guilt of those who act wrongly must depend, at\nleast in part, upon certain facts about them. A schizophrenic\nyoung man who tragically kills his loving mother, believing her to be\na sinister space alien who has devoured his real mother, may need\ntreatment, they would say, but a just punishment seems out of the\nquestion. Similarly, the personal guilt of those who disobey God or\nviolate the divine commands must likewise depend upon the answer to\nsuch questions as these: Have they knowingly violated a\ndivine command?\u2014and if so, to what extent are they responsible\nfor their own rebellious impulses? To what extent do they possess not\nonly an implicit knowledge of God and the divine commands, but a clear\nvision of the nature of God? To what extent do they see clearly the\nchoice of roads, the consequences of their actions, or the true nature\nof evil? Even many Augustinians admit the relevance of such questions\nwhen they insist that Adam\u2019s sin was especially heinous because\nhe supposedly had special advantages, such as great happiness and the\nbeatific vision, that his descendants do not enjoy. If Adam\u2019s\nsin was especially heinous because he had special advantages, then the\nsins of those who lack his special advantages must be less heinous;\nand if that is true, if some sins against God are less heinous than\nothers, then the greatness of God cannot be the only, or even the\ndecisive, factor in determining the degree of one\u2019s personal\nguilt or the seriousness of a given sin (see Adams 1975, 442 and\nKvanvig 1993, 40\u201350).\n\nSecond, virtually all retributivists, with the notable exception of\nthe Augustinian theologians, reject as absurd the whole idea of\ninherited guilt. So why, one may ask, do so many Augustinians, despite\ntheir commitment to a retributive theory of punishment, insist that\nGod could justly condemn even infants on account of their supposedly\ninherited guilt? Part of the explanation, according to Philip Quinn,\nmay lie \u201cin a homuncular view of human nature itself\u201d\n(Quinn 1988, 99) or in what some philosophers might label as a simple\ncategory mistake. A good illustration of the homuncular view, as Quinn\ncalls it, might be the following chapter heading in Anselm\u2019s\nCur Deus Homo: \u201cWhat it was that man, when he sinned,\nremoved from God and cannot repay\u201d (I, Ch. 23). The implication\nof such language, which we also find in Augustine, Calvin, and a host\nof others, is that humankind or human nature or the human race as a\nwhole is itself a person (or homunculus) who can act and sin against\nGod. Perhaps that explains how Augustine could write: \u201cMan\n\u2026 produced depraved and condemned children. For we were all in\nthat one man, since we were all that one man who fell into sin\u201d\n(City of God, Bk. XIII, Ch. 14). And perhaps it also explains\nhow Calvin could write: \u201ceven infants themselves, while they\ncarry their condemnation with them from the mother\u2019s womb, are\nguilty not of another\u2019s fault but of their own\u201d fault\n(Calvin 1536, Bk. II, Ch. I, sec. 8). The reasoning here appears to\nrun as follows: Humankind is guilty of a grievous offense against God;\ninfants are instances of humankind; therefore, infants are likewise\nguilty of a grievous offense against God. But most retributivists\nwould reject this way of speaking as simply incoherent. Whether one\nagrees with it or not, one can at least understand the claim that\nAdam\u2019s sin had disastrous consequences for all his progeny in\nthat they inherited many defects, deficiencies, and degenerate\ndispositions. One can also understand Calvin\u2019s claim that, as a\nresult of original sin, \u201cour own insight \u2026 is utterly\nblind and stupid in divine matters\u201d and that \u201cman\u2019s\nkeenness of mind is mere blindness as far as the knowledge of God is\nconcerned\u201d (Calvin 1536, Bk. II, Ch. II, sec. 19). One can even\nunderstand the claim that we are morally responsible for doing\nsomething about our inherited defects, provided that we have the power\nand the opportunity to do so. But the claim that we are born\nguilty is another matter, as is the claim that we are all\ndeserving of everlasting punishment on account of having inherited\ncertain defects or deficiencies. Most retributivists would regard such\ninherited defects as excusing conditions that decrease,\nrather than increase, the degree of one\u2019s personal\nguilt. So even though the Augustinians accept the idea of divine\nretribution, they appear at the same time to reject important parts of\nthe retributive theory of punishment.\n\nThird, if, as Anselm insisted, even the slightest offense against God\nis infinitely serious and thus deserves a permanent loss of happiness\nas a just recompense, then the idea, so essential to the retributive\ntheory, that we can grade offenses and fit lesser punishments to\nlesser crimes appears to be in danger of collapsing. Many Christians\ndo, it is true, speculate that gradations of punishment exist in hell;\nsome sinners, they suggest, may experience greater pain than others,\nand some places in hell may be hotter than others. Augustine even\ntried to ameliorate his views concerning the fate of unbaptized\ninfants by suggesting that \u201csuch infants as quit the body\nwithout being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of\nall\u201d (On Merit and the Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism\nof Infants, Bk. I, Ch. 21\n [available online]).\n But many retributivists would nonetheless respond as follows. If all\nof those in hell, including the condemned infants, are dead in the\ntheological sense of being separated from God forever, and if this\nimplies a permanent loss of both the beatific vision and every other\nconceivable source of worthwhile happiness, then they have all\nreceived a punishment so severe that the further grading of offenses\nseems pointless. We would hardly regard a king who executes every\nlaw-breaker, the jaywalker no less than the murderer, as just; nor\nwould we feel much better if, in an effort to fit the punishment to\nthe crime, the king should reserve the more \u201chumane\u201d forms\nof execution for the jaywalker. Once you make a permanent and\nirreversible loss of happiness the supposedly just penalty for the\nmost minor offense, the only option left for more serious offenses is\nto pile on additional suffering. But at some point piling on\nadditional suffering for more serious offenses seems utterly demonic,\nor at least so many retributivists would insist; and it does nothing\nto ameliorate a permanent loss of happiness for a minor offense or, as\nin the case of non-elect babies who die in infancy, for no real\noffense at all.\n\nAll of which brings one to what Marilyn McCord Adams and many others\nsee as the most crucial question of all. How could any sin\nthat a finite being commits in a context of ambiguity, ignorance, and\nillusion deserve an infinite penalty as a just recompense? (See Adams\n1993, 313).\n2.2 Challenging the Retributive Theory Itself\n\nAnother set of objections to the Augustinian understanding of hell\narises from the perspective of those who reject a retributive theory\nof punishment. According to Anselm and the Augustinians generally, no\npunishment that a sinner might endure over a finite period of time can\njustly compensate for the slightest offense against God. Anselm thus\nspeculated that if no suffering of finite duration will fully\nsatisfy the demands of justice, perhaps suffering of infinite\nduration will do the trick. But the truth, according to many critics,\nis that no suffering and no punishment of any duration could\nin and of itself compensate for someone\u2019s wrongdoing.\nIn the right circumstances punishment might be a means to something\nthat satisfies the demands of justice, but it has no power to do so in\nand of itself. The Victorian visionary George MacDonald thus put it\nthis way: \u201cPunishment, or deserved suffering, is no equipoise to\nsin. It is no use laying it on the other scale. It will not move it a\nhair\u2019s breadth. Suffering weighs nothing at all against\nsin\u201d (MacDonald 1889, 510). Why not? Because punishment, whether\nit consists of additional suffering or a painless annihilation, does\nnothing in and of itself, MacDonald insisted, to cancel out a sin, to\ncompensate or to make up for it, to repair the harm that it brings\ninto our lives, or to heal the estrangement that makes it possible in\nthe first\n place.[5]\n Neither does it justify God\u2019s decision to permit the wrongdoing\nin the first place.\n\nSo what, theoretically, would make things right or fully\nsatisfy justice in the event that someone should commit murder or\notherwise act wrongly? Whereas the Augustinians insist that justice\nrequires punishment, other religious writers insist that justice\nrequires something very different, namely reconciliation and\nrestoration (see, for example, Marshall, 2001). Only God,\nhowever, has the power to achieve true restoration in the case of\nmurder, because divine omnipotence can resurrect the victims of murder\njust as easily as it can the victims of old age. According to George\nMacDonald, whose religious vision was almost the polar opposite of the\nAugustinian vision, perfect justice therefore requires,\nfirst, that sinners repent of their sin and turn away from everything\nthat would separate them from God and from others; it requires,\nsecond, that God forgive repentant sinners and that they forgive each\nother; and it requires, third, that God overcome, perhaps with their\nown cooperation, any harm that sinners do either to others or to\nthemselves. Augustinians typically object to the idea that divine\njustice, no less than divine love, requires that God forgive sinners\nand undertake the divine toil of restoring a just order. But MacDonald\ninsisted that, even as human parents have an obligation to care for\ntheir children, so God has a freely accepted responsibility, as our\nCreator, to meet our moral and spiritual needs. God therefore\nowes us forgiveness for the same reason that human parents\nowe it to their children to forgive them in the event that\nthey misbehave. Of course, precisely because they do forgive their\nchildren, loving parents may sometimes punish their children and even\nhold the feet of a child to the proverbial fire when this seems\nnecessary for the child\u2019s own welfare. And if the time should\ncome when loving parents are required to respect the misguided choices\nof a rebellious teenager or an adult child, they will always stand\nready to restore fellowship with a prodigal son or daughter in the\nevent of a ruptured relationship.\n\nWe thus encounter two radically different religious visions of divine\njustice, both of which deserve a full and careful examination.\nAccording to the Augustinian vision, those condemned to hell are\nrecipients of divine justice but are not recipients of divine mercy;\nhence justice and mercy are, according to this vision, radically\ndifferent (perhaps even inconsistent) attributes of\n God.[6]\n But according to an alternative religious vision, as exemplified in\nthe work of George MacDonald 1889 and J.A.T. Robinson 1968,\nGod\u2019s justice and mercy are the very same attribute in this\nsense: divine justice is altogether merciful even as divine mercy is\naltogether just. \n3. Free-will Theodicies of Hell\n\nUnlike the Augustinians, Arminian theologians emphasize the role that\nfree will plays in determining one\u2019s eternal destiny in heaven\nor hell; they also accept the so-called libertarian understanding of\nfree will, according to which freedom and determinism are incompatible\n(see the entry on\n free will)).\n Because not even an omnipotent being can causally determine a\ngenuinely free choice, the reality of free will, they say, introduces\ninto the universe an element that, from God\u2019s perspective, is\nutterly random in that it lies outside of God\u2019s direct causal\ncontrol. Accordingly, if some person should freely act\nwrongly\u2014or worse yet, freely reject God\u2019s grace\u2014in a\ngiven set of circumstances, then it was not within God\u2019s power\nto induce this person to have freely acted otherwise, at least not in\nthe exact same circumstances in which the person was left free to act\nwrongly. So in that sense, our human free choices, particularly the\nbad ones, are genuine obstacles that God must work around in order to\nbring a set of loving purposes to fruition. And this may suggest the\nfurther possibility that, with respect to some free persons, God\ncannot both preserve their their libertarian freedom in the\nmatter and prevent them from freely continuing to reject God\nforever. As C. S. Lewis, an early 20th Century proponent of such a\ntheodicy, once put it, \u201cIn creating beings with free will,\nomnipotence from the outset submits to the possibility of \u2026\ndefeat. \u2026 I willingly believe that the damned are, in one\nsense, successful, rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are\nlocked on the inside\u201d (Lewis 1944, 115). \n\nThe basic idea here is that hell, along with the self imposed misery\nit entails, is essentially a freely embraced condition rather\nthan a forcibly imposed\n punishment;[7]\n and because freedom and determinism are incompatible, the creation of\nfree moral agents carries an inherent risk of ultimate tragedy.\nWhether essential to our personhood or not, free will is a precious\ngift, an expression of God\u2019s love for us; and because the very\nlove that seeks our salvation also respects our freedom, God will not\nprevent us from separating ourselves from him, even forever, if that\nis what we freely choose to do. So even though the perfectly loving\nGod would never reject anyone, sinners can reject God and thus freely\nseparate themselves from the divine nature; they not only have the\npower as free agents to reject God for a season, during the time when\nthey are mired in ambiguity and subject to illusion, but they are also\nable to cling forever to the illusions that make such rejection\npossible in the first place. \n\nBut why suppose it even possible that a free creature should freely\nreject forever the redemptive will of a perfectly loving and\ninfinitely resourceful God? In the relevant literature over the past\nseveral decades, advocates of a free-will theodicy of hell have\noffered at least three quite different answers to this question: \n\nPerhaps the most commonly expressed answer concerns the\npossibility of an irrevocable decision to reject God forever. Jerry\nWalls thus describes the damned as those who have made a decisive\nchoice of evil (see Walls 1992, Ch. 5), Richard Swinburne suggests\nthat \u201conce our will is fixed for bad, we shall never [again]\ndesire or seek what we have missed\u201d because we have made an\n\u201cirrevocable choice of character\u201d (Swinburne 1989, 199),\nand R. Zachary Manis interprets Kierkegaard, whose view he defends, as\nsuggesting that the \u201cdamned are so filled with hatred \u2026\nso motivated by malice and spite \u2026 that they will to remain in\ntheir state of torment, all for the sake of demonstrating that they\nare in the right, and that God is in the wrong\u201d (Manis 2016,\n290).\nAnother proposed answer rejects altogether the traditional idea\nthat those in hell are lost without any further hope of restoration.\nBuckareff and Plug (2005) have thus argued from the very nature of the\ndivine perfections (including perfect love) that God will always have\n\u201can open-door policy towards those in hell\u2014making it\n[always] possible for those in hell to escape\u201d (39); and\nsimilarly, Raymond VanArragon has argued that those in hell continue\nto reject God freely only if they retain the power to act otherwise\nand hence also the power to repent and be saved (see VanArragon 2010).\nBecause the damned never lose forever their libertarian freedom in\nrelation to God\u2019s offer of salvation, in other words, and never\nlose forever the psychological possibility of genuine repentance,\nthere is no irreversible finality in the so-called final\n judgment.[8]\n Still, the possibility remains, according to this view, that some\nwill never avail themselves of the opportunity to escape from hell.\n\nA third proposed answer rests upon a Molinist perspective,\naccording to which God\u2019s omniscience includes what philosophers\nnow call middle knowledge, which in turn includes far more than a\nsimple foreknowledge of a person\u2019s future free actions. It also\nincludes a perfect knowledge uf what a person would have done\nfreely in circumstances that will never even obtain. So with\nrespect to the decision whether or not to create a given person and to\nplace that person in a given set of circumstances, God can base this\ndecision in part on a knowledge of what the person would do freely if\ncreated and placed in these precise circumstances\u2014or if, for\nthat matter, the person were placed in any other possible set of\ncircumstances as well. From this Molinist perspective, William Lane\nCraig has defended the possibility that some free persons are utterly\nirredeemable in this sense: short of overriding their libertarian\nfreedom, nothing God might do for them\u2014whether it be to impart a\nspecial revelation. to administer an appropriate punishment, or to\nhelp them in some other way\u2014will ever win them over or persuade\nthem to repent as a means of becoming reconciled to God (Craig 1989).\nCraig himself calls this dreadful property of being irredeemable\ntransworld damnation (184).\n\n\nIn part because it rests upon the idea of middle knowledge, which is\nitself controversial, Craig\u2019s idea of transworld\ndamnation may be the most controversial idea that any proponent\nof a free will theodicy of hell has put forward. It also raises the\nquestion of why a morally perfect God would create someone (or\ninstantiate the individual essence of someone) whom God already knew\nin advance would be irredeemable. By way of an answer, Craig insists\non the possibility that some persons would submit to God freely only\nin a world in which others should damn themselves forever; it is even\npossible, he insists, that God must permit a large number of people to\ndamn themselves in order to fill heaven with a larger number of\nredeemed. Craig himself has put it this way:\n\nIt is possible that the terrible price of filling heaven is also\nfilling hell and that in any other possible world which was feasible\nfor God the balance between saved and lost was worse. It is possible\nthat had God actualized a world in which there are less persons in\nhell, there would also have been less persons in heaven. It is\npossible that in order to achieve this much blessedness, God was\nforced to accept this much loss (1989, 183).\n\n\nAs this passage illustrates, Craig accepts at least the possibility\nthat, because of free will, history includes an element of\nirreducible tragedy; he even accepts the possibility that if\nfewer people were damned to hell, then fewer people would have been\nsaved as well. So perhaps God knows from the outset that a complete\ntriumph over evil is unfeasible no matter what divine actions might be\ntaken; as a result, God merely tries to minimize the defeat, to cut\nthe losses, and in the process to fill heaven with more saints than\notherwise would have been feasible. (For a critique of this reply, see\nTalbott 1992; for Craig\u2019s rejoinder, see Craig 1993; and for a\ncritique of Craig\u2019s rejoinder, see Seymour 2000a.) \n\nIn any case, how one assesses each of the three answers above will\ndepend upon how one understands the idea of moral freedom and the role\nit plays, if any, in someone landing in either heaven or hell. The\nfirst two answers also represent a fundamental disagreement concerning\nthe existence of free will in hell and perhaps even the nature of free\nwill itself. According to the first answer, the inhabitants of hell\nare those who have freely acquired a consistently evil will and an\nirreversibly bad moral character. So for the rest of eternity, these\ninhabitants of hell do not even continue rejecting God freely\nin any sense that requires the psychological possibility of choosing\notherwise. But is such an irreversibly bad moral character even\ncoherent or metaphysically possible? Not according to the second\nanswer, which implies that a morally perfect God would never cease\nproviding those in hell with opportunities for repentance and\nproviding these opportunities in contexts where such repentance\nremains a genuine psychological possibility. All of which points once\nagain to the need for a clearer understanding of the nature and\npurpose of moral freedom. (See section 5.1 below for some additional\nissues that arise in connection with freedom in heaven and hell.) \n3.1 Moral Freedom and Rationality\n\nGiven the New Testament imagery associated with Gehenna, the Lake of\nFire, and the outer darkness\u2014where there is \u201cweeping and\ngnashing of teeth\u201d\u2014the question is not how\nsomeone in a context of ambiguity, ignorance, and misperception could\nfreely choose separation from the divine nature over union with it;\nthe question is instead how someone could both experience\nsuch separation (or the unbearable misery of hell, for example)\nand freely choose to remain in such a state forever. This is\nnot a problem for the Augustinians because, according to them, the\ndamned have no further choice in the matter once their everlasting\npunishment commences. But it is a problem for those free-will theists\nwho believe that the damned freely embrace an eternal destiny apart\nfrom God, and the latter view requires, at the very least, a plausible\naccount of the relevant freedom. \n\nNow, as already indicated, those who embrace a free-will theodicy of\nhell typically appeal, in the words of Jonathan Kvanvig, to \u201ca\nlibertarian account of human freedom in order to provide a complete\nresponse to\u201d the problem of hell (Kvanvig 2011, 54). But of\ncourse such a \u201ccomplete response\u201d would also require a\nrelatively complete account of libertarian freedom. According to\nKvanvig, \u201csome formulation of the Principle of Alternative\nPossibilities (PAP) correctly describes this notion of [libertarian]\nfreedom\u201d; and, as he also points out, this \u201cprinciple\nclaims that in order to act freely one must be able to do\notherwise\u201d (48). But at most PAP merely sets forth a necessary\ncondition of someone acting freely in the libertarian sense, and it\nincludes no requirement that a free choice be even minimally rational.\nSo consider again the example, introduced in section 2.1 above, of a\nschizophrenic young man who kills his loving mother, believing her to\nbe a sinister space alien who has devoured his real mother; and this\ntime suppose further that he does so in a context in which PAP obtains\nand he categorically could have chosen otherwise (perhaps because he\nworries about possible retaliation from other sinister space aliens).\nWhy suppose that such an irrational choice and action, even if not\ncausally determined, would qualify as an instance of acting freely?\nEither our seriously deluded beliefs, particularly those with\ndestructive consequences in our own lives, are in principle\ncorrectable by some degree of powerful evidence against them, or the\nchoices that rest upon them are simply too irrational to qualify as\nfree moral choices.\n\nIf that is true, then not just any causally undetermined choice, or\njust any agent caused choice, or just any randomly generated selection\nbetween alternatives will qualify as a free choice for which the\nchoosing agent is morally responsible. Moral freedom also requires a\nminimal degree of rationality on the part of the choosing agent,\nincluding an ability to learn from experience, an ability to discern\nnormal reasons for acting, and a capacity for moral improvement. With\ngood reason, therefore, do we exclude lower animals, small children,\nthe severely brain damaged, and perhaps even paranoid schizophrenics\nfrom the class of free moral agents. For, however causally\nundetermined some of their behaviors might be, they all lack some part\nof the rationality required to qualify as free moral\n agents.[9]\n\n\nNow consider again the view of C. S. Lewis and many other Christians\nconcerning the bliss that union with the divine nature entails, so\nthey believe. and the objective horror that separation from it\nentails, and suppose that the outer darkness\u2014that is, a soul\nsuspended alone in nothingness, without even a physical order to\nexperience and without any human relationships at all\u2014should be\nthe logical limit (short of annihilation) of possible separation from\nthe divine nature. These ideas seem to lead naturally to a dilemma\nargument for the conclusion that a freely chosen eternal destiny apart\nfrom God is metaphysically impossible. For either a person S is fully\ninformed about who God is and what both union with the divine nature\nand separation from it would entail, or S is not so informed. If S\nis fully informed and should choose a life apart from God\nanyway, then S\u2019s choice would be utterly and almost\ninconceivably irrational; such a choice would fall well below the\nthreshold required for moral freedom. And if S is not fully informed,\nthen God can of course continue to work with S, subjecting S to new\nexperiences, shattering S\u2019s illusions, and correcting S\u2019s\nmisjudgments in perfectly natural ways that do not interfere with\nS\u2019s freedom. Beyond that, for as long as S remains less than\nfully informed, S is simply in no position to reject the true God; S\nmay reject a caricature of God, perhaps even a caricature of S\u2019s\nown devising, but S is in no position to reject the true God.\nTherefore, in either case, whether S is fully informed or less than\nfully informed, it is simply not possible that S should reject the\ntrue God freely. \n\nBy way of a reply to this argument and in defense of his own\nfree\u2013will approach to hell\u2014which, by the way, in no way\nexcludes the possibility that some inhabitants of hell may\neventually escape from it\u2014Jerry Walls concedes that \u201cthe\nchoice of evil is impossible for anyone who has a fully formed\nawareness that God is the source of happiness and sin the cause of\nmisery\u201d (Walls 1992, 133). But Walls also contends that, even if\nthose in hell have rejected a caricature of God rather than the true\nGod, it remains possible that some of them will finally make a\ndecisive choice of evil and will thus remain in hell forever.\nHe then makes a three-fold claim: first, that the damned have in some\nsense deluded themselves, second, that they have the power to cling to\ntheir delusions forever, and third, that God cannot forcibly remove\ntheir self-imposed deceptions without interfering with their\nfreedom in relation to God (Walls 1992, Ch. 5).\n\nFor more detailed discussions of these and related issues, see\nSwinburne 1989 (Ch. 12), Craig 1989 and 1993, Talbott 2007, Walls 1992\n(Ch. 5), 2004a, and 2004b, Kronen and Reitan 2011 (142\u2013146), and\nManis 2016 and 2019. See also sections 4.2 and 5.1 below.\n3.2 Moral Freedom and Irreparable Harm\n\nConsider now the two conditions under which we humans typically feel\njustified in interfering with the freedom of others (see Talbott\n1990a, 38). We feel justified, on the one hand, in preventing one\nperson from doing irreparable harm\u2014or more accurately, harm that\nno human being can repair\u2014to another; a loving father\nmay thus report his own son to the police in an effort to prevent the\nson from committing murder. We also feel justified, on the other hand,\nin preventing our loved ones from doing irreparable harm to\nthemselves; a loving father may thus physically overpower his daughter\nin an effort to prevent her from committing suicide.\n\nNow one might, it is true, draw a number of faulty inferences from\nsuch examples as these, in part because we humans tend to think of\nirreparable harm within the context of a very limited timeframe, a\nperson\u2019s life on earth. Harm that no human being can repair may\nnonetheless be harm that God can repair. It does not follow,\ntherefore, that a loving and omnipotent God, whose goal is the\nreconciliation of the world, would prevent every suicide and every\nmurder; it follows only that such a God would prevent every harm that\nnot even omnipotence could repair at some future time, and neither\nsuicide nor murder is necessarily an instance of that kind of\nharm. So even though a loving God might sometimes permit murder, such\na God would never permit one person to annihilate the soul of another\nor to destroy the very possibility of future happiness in another; and\neven though a loving God might sometimes permit suicide, such a God\nwould never permit genuine loved ones to destroy the very possibility\nof future happiness in themselves either. The latter conclusion\nconcerning suicide is no doubt the more controversial, and Jonathan\nKvanvig in particular has challenged it (see Kvanvig 1993,\n83\u201388). But whatever the resolution of this particular debate,\nperhaps both parties can agree that God, as Creator, would deal with a\nmuch larger picture and a much longer timeframe than that with which\nwe humans are immediately concerned.\n\nSo the idea of irreparable harm\u2014that is, of harm that\nnot even omnipotence could ever repair\u2014is critical at this\npoint. It is most relevant, perhaps, in cases where someone imagines\nsinners freely choosing annihilation (Kvanvig), or imagines them\nfreely making a decisive and irreversible choice of evil (Walls), or\nimagines them freely locking the gates of hell from the inside (C. S.\nLewis). But proponents of the so-called escapism understanding of hell\ncan plausibly counter that hell is not necessarily an instance of such\nirreparable harm, and Raymond VanArragon in particular raises the\npossibility that God might permit some loved ones to continue forever\nrejecting God in a non-decisive way that would not, at any given time,\nharm them irreparably (see VanArragon 2010, 37ff; see also Kvanvig\n2011, 52). Here it is perhaps worth noting how broadly VanArragon\ndefines the term \u201crejecting God\u201d (see 2010,\n30\u201331)\u2014so broadly, in fact, that any sin for which one is\nmorally responsible would count as an instance of someone rejecting\nGod. He thus explicitly states that rejecting God in his broad sense\nrequires neither an awareness of God nor a conscious decision, however\nconfused it may be, to embrace a life apart from God. Accordingly,\npersistent sinning without end would never result, given such an\naccount, in anything like the traditional hell, whether the latter be\nunderstood as a lake of fire, the outer darkness, or any other\ncondition that would reveal the full horror of separation from God\n(given the traditional Christian understanding of such separation).\nNeither would such a sinner ever achieve a state of full clarity. For\ngiven VanArragon\u2019s understanding of libertarian freedom,\ncontinuing to sin forever would require a perpetual context of\nambiguity, ignorance, and misperception. \n4. The Universalist Rejection of Everlasting Separation\n\nA theist of any religion who accepts the traditional idea of\neverlasting punishment, or even the idea of an everlasting separation\nfrom God, must either reject the idea that that all human sinners are\nequal objects of God\u2019s redemptive love (see proposition (1) in\nsection 1 above) or reject the idea that God\u2019s redemptive love\nwill triumph in the end and bring reconciliation to each and every\nobject of such divine love (see proposition (2)). But a theist who\naccepts proposition (1), as the Arminians do, and also accepts\nproposition (2), as the Augustinians do, can then reason deductively\nthat almighty God will indeed triumph in the end and successfully win\nover each and every human sinner. From the perspective of an\ninterpretation of the Christian Bible, moreover, Christian\nuniversalists need only accept the exegetical arguments of the\nArminian theologians in support of (1) and the exegetical arguments of\nthe Augustinian theologians in support of (2); that alone would enable\nthem to build an exegetical case for a universalist interpretation of\nthe Bible as a whole.\n4.1 Divine Grace and the Inclusive Nature of Love\n\nOne argument in support of proposition (1) contends that love\n(especially in the form of willing the very best for another) is\ninclusive in this sense: even where it is logically possible for a\nloving relationship to come to an end, two persons are bound together\nin love only when their purposes and interests, even the conditions of\ntheir happiness, are so logically intertwined as to be inseparable. If\na mother should love her child even as she loves herself, for example,\nthen any evil that befalls the child is likewise an evil that befalls\nthe mother and any good that befalls the child is likewise a good that\nbefalls the mother; hence, it is simply not possible, according to\nthis argument, for God to will the best for the mother without also\nwilling the best for the child as well.\n\nFor similar reasons, Kenneth Einar Himma has argued that some\nwidespread moral intuitions, \u201ctogether with Christian\nexclusivism and the traditional doctrine of hell, entail that it is\nmorally wrong for anyone to have children\u201d (Himma 2011, 198).\nThat argument seems especially forceful in the context of Augustinian\ntheology, which implies that, for all any set of potential parents\nknow, any child they might produce could be one of the reprobate whom\nGod has hated from the beginning and has destined from the beginning\nfor eternal torment in hell. The title of Himma\u2019s article,\n\u201cBirth as a Grave Misfortune,\u201d would seem to describe such\ncases perfectly. (See Bawulski 2013 for a reply to Himma and Himma\n2016 for Himma\u2019s rejoinder.)\n\nIn any event, Arminians and universalists both regard an acceptance of\nproposition (1) as essential to a proper understanding of divine\ngrace. Could God truly extend grace to an elect mother, they might\nask, by making the baby she loves with all her heart the object of a\ndivine hatred and do this, as the Augustinians say was done in the\ncase of Esau, even before the child was born or had done anything good\nor bad? As the Arminians and the universalists both view the matter,\nthe Augustinians have embraced a logical impossibility: the idea that\nGod could extend a genuine love and compassion to one person even as\nGod withholds it from some of that person\u2019s own loved ones. They\ntherefore reject the doctrine of limited election on the ground that\nit undermines the concept of grace altogether. Where they disagree, of\ncourse, is over the issue of whether the objects of God\u2019s love\ncan resist his grace forever. Whereas Arminians hold that, given the\nreality of free will, we humans can, if we so choose, resist\nGod\u2019s grace forever, universalists tend to believe that, even\nthough we can resist God\u2019s grace for a while, perhaps even for a\nsubstantial period of time (while mired in ignorance and ambiguity),\nwe cannot resist it forever. So the issue between these two camps, the\nArminians and the universalists, finally comes down to the question of\nwhich position has the resources for a better account of human freedom\nand of God\u2019s respect for it (see, for example, the exchange\nbetween Walls 2004 and Talbott 2004). Or, to put the question in a\nslightly different way, which position, if either, requires that God\ninterfere with human freedom (or human autonomy) in morally\ninappropriate ways? As the following section should illustrate, the\nanswer to this question may be far more complicated than some might at\nfirst imagine.\n4.2 Universalism and Human Freedom\n\nA widely held assumption among free\u2013will theists is that no\nguarantee of universal reconciliation is even possible apart from\nGod\u2019s willingness to interfere with human freedom in those cases\nwhere someone persists in rejecting God and his grace. Indeed,\nJonathan Kvanvig goes so far as to describe universalism as a\n\u201cview, according to which God finally decides that if one has\nnot freely chosen Heaven, there will come a time when one will be\nbrought to Heaven against one\u2019s will. One will experience, in\nthis sense, coercive redemption at some point\u201d (Kvanvig 2011,\n14). But in fact, no universalist\u2014not even a theological\ndeterminist\u2014holds that God sometimes coerces people into heaven\nagainst their will. For although many Christian universalists\nbelieve that God provided Saul of Tarsus with certain revelatory\nexperiences that changed his mind in the end and therefore\nchanged his will as well, this is a far cry from claiming that he was\ncoerced against his will. Kvanvig\u2019s own understanding of\nlibertarian freedom, moreover, already establishes the logical\npossibility that God can bring about a universal reconciliation\nwithout in any way interfering with human freedom. \n\nBut in addition to defending the bare logical possibility of such a\nuniversal reconciliation on libertarian grounds, Eric Reitan has set\nforth an intriguing argument, which he calls \u201cthe Argument from\nInfinite Opportunity,\u201d for the conclusion that God can\neffectively guarantee the salvation of all sinners without ever\ninterfering with anyone\u2019s libertarian freedom (see Kronen and\nReitan 2011, Ch. 8). The basic idea here is that a sinner could have,\nif necessary, infinitely many opportunities over an unending stretch\nof time to repent and to submit to God freely. So consider this.\nAlthough it is logically possible, given the normal philosophical view\nof the matter, that a fair coin would never land heads up, not even\nonce in a trillion tosses, such an eventuality is so incredibly\nimprobable and so close to an impossibility that no one need fear it\nactually happening. Similarly, in working with some sinner S\n(shattering S\u2019s illusions and correcting S\u2019s ignorance),\nGod could presumably bring S to a point, just short of actually\ndetermining S\u2019s choice, where S would see the choice between\nhorror and bliss with such clarity that the probability of S repenting\nand submitting to God would be extremely high. Or, if you prefer, drop\nthe probability to .5. Over an indefinitely long period of time, S\nwould still have an indefinitely large number of opportunities to\nrepent; and so, according to Reitan, the assumption that sinners\nretain their libertarian freedom together with the Christian doctrine\nof the preservation of the saints yields the following result. We can\nbe just as confident that God will eventually win over all sinners\n(and do so without causally determining their choices), as we can be\nthat a fair coin will land heads up at least once in a trillion\ntosses.\n\nA possible reply to Reitan\u2019s argument, as just briefly\nsummarized, is that our free choices can sometimes create a hardened\ncharacter, which in turn places constraints on future free choices.\nBut either the hardened character of those in hell removes forever the\npsychological possibility of their choosing to repent, or it does not.\nIf it does remove that psychological possibility, then they do not\ncontinue rejecting God freely in the sense that the Principle of\nAlternative Possibilities (PAP) requires; and if it does not remove\nthat psychological possibility, then Reitan\u2019s argument remains\npertinent. Beyond that, the most critical issue at this point concerns\nthe relationship between free choice, on the one hand, and character\nformation, on the other. Our moral experience does seem to provide\nevidence that a pattern of bad choices can sometimes produce bad\nhabits and a bad moral character, but it also seems to provide\nevidence that a pattern of bad choices can sometimes bring one closer\nto a dramatic conversion of some kind. So why not suppose that a\npattern of bad choices might be even more useful to God than a pattern\nof good choices would be in teaching the hard lessons we sometimes\nneed to learn and in thus rendering a dramatic conversion increasingly\nmore probable over the long run? Are not the destructive consequences\nthat alcoholism can have in the lives of some people the very thing\nthat sometimes motivates them to seek help and even to give up alcohol\n altogether?[10]\n For more on the issue of free will and character formation, see\nSwinburne 1989 (Ch. 12), Sennett 1999, Murray 1999, the rejoinder to\nMurray in Kronen and Reitan 2011 (170\u2013177), the discussion of\ncharacter formation in Talbott 2010 (9\u201313), and section 5.1\nbelow.\n4.3 The Limits of God\u2019s Power to Preserve Human Freedom\n\nSuppose that a man is standing atop the Empire State Building with the\nintent of committing suicide by jumping off and plunging to his death\nbelow. One obvious way in which God could interfere with the\nman\u2019s freedom in this matter would be simply to cause him to\nchange his mind; that would effectively prevent the suicide from\noccurring. But there is another, less obvious, way in which God could\ninterfere with the man\u2019s freedom to commit suicide; God could\npermit him to leap from the building and then cause him to float\ngently to the ground like a feather; that too would effectively\nprevent the suicide from occurring. So one is not free to accomplish\nsome action or to achieve some end, unless God permits one to\nexperience the chosen end, however confusedly one may have chosen it;\nand neither is one free to separate oneself from God, or from the\nultimate source of human happiness as Christians understand it, unless\nGod permits one to experience the very life one has chosen and the\nfull measure of misery that it entails.\n\nGiven the almost universal Christian assumption that a complete\nseparation from the divine nature (in the outer darkness, for example)\nwould be an objective horror, it seems to follow that even God would\nface a dilemma with respect to human freedom. For either God could\npermit sinners to follow a path that ultimately leads, according to\nChristian theology, to an objective horror and permit them to continue\nfollowing it for as long as they freely choose to do so, or God could\nat some point prevent them from continuing along their freely chosen\npath. If God should permit sinners to continue along their freely\nchosen path\u2014the one that unbeknownst to them will inevitably\nlead them to an objective horror\u2014then their own experience,\nprovided they are rational enough to qualify as free moral agents,\nwould eventually shatter their illusions and remove their\nlibertarian freedom to continue along that path.\nAlternatively, if God should prevent sinners from achieving their\nfreely chosen goal of separating themselves from the divine nature,\nthen they would have no real freedom to do so. In neither case,\ntherefore, would sinners be able to retain forever their libertarian\nfreedom to continue separating themselves from the divine nature and\nfrom the ultimate source of human happiness. \n\nIf this argument should be sound, it also seems to follow that, no\nmatter how tenaciously some sinners might pursue a life apart from God\nand resist the divine purpose for their lives, God would have, as a\nsort of last resort, a sure-fire way to shatter the illusions that\nmake their rebellion possible in the first place. To do so, God need\nonly honor their own free choices and permit them to experience the\nvery life they have confusedly chosen for themselves. Why interfere\nwith someone\u2019s freedom, after all, at the very point where\nhonoring that freedom would in fact teach a hard lesson and therefore\ndo the most good? Would that not be utterly incompatible with\nGod\u2019s moral character, as most Christians understand it? \n\nHowever one might answer such a question, the Christian\nuniversalist\u2019s understanding of the nature and scope of\nGod\u2019s irresistible grace is very different from the Augustinian\nunderstanding of it. For Christian universalists not only reject the\nAugustinian idea that God\u2019s irresistible grace extends to a\nlimited elect only; they also hold that God\u2019s judgment of sin is\nessentially a matter of permitting sinners to experience the very\ncondition of separation they have confusedly chosen for themselves.\nMany Christian universalists are thus fond of quoting St. Paul\u2019s\nremark that \u201cGod has bound everyone over to disobedience so that\nhe may have mercy on them all\u201d (Rom. 11:32\u2014NIV), and they\ninterpret this as a declaration that divine judgment, however harsh it\nmay seem, is itself an expression of divine mercy and is therefore\npart of what makes God\u2019s grace irresistible in the end. If, as a\nlast resort, God should allow a sinner to live for a while without\neven an implicit experience of the divine\n nature,[11]\n the resulting horror, they believe, will at last shatter any illusion\nthat some good is achievable apart from God; and such a discovery will\nfinally elicit a cry for help of a kind that, however faint it may be,\nis just what God needs in order to begin and eventually to complete\nthe process of reconciliation. \n\nIn sum, opponents of universalism must either restrict God\u2019s\nredemptive love to a limited elect or admit that God\u2019s love will\nsuffer an ultimate defeat in this sense: God\u2019s own desire for\nthe human race as a whole, as expressed in a place like 1 Timothy 2:4,\nwill never be satisfied. Because the Arminians and the universalists\nagree that God could never love an elect mother even as, at the same\ntime, God rejects her beloved baby, they both agree that the first\nalternative is utterly impossible. But because the issues surrounding\nthe idea of free will are so complex and remain the source of so much\nphilosophical controversy, perhaps they can also agree that a\nfree\u2013will theodicy of hell is the best philosophical account\ncurrently available for a doctrine of everlasting separation from God.\n\n5. Heaven: Three Critical Issues\n\nRarely, if ever, are Christian theologians very specific about what\nheaven will supposedly be like, and there are no doubt good reasons\nfor this. For most of them would deny that the primary sources of the\nChristian faith, such as the Bible, provide much information on this\nparticular matter. But three issues have typically arisen in the\nrelevant philosophical literature: first, because so many of the\nrecent Christian philosophers have focused upon free will theodicies\nof hell, it is hardly surprising that the issue of freedom in heaven\nshould likewise have arisen; a second issue is whether the misery of\nloved ones in hell would undermine the blessedness of those in heaven;\nand a third issue is whether immortality of any kind would ultimately\nlead to tedium, boredom, and an insipid life.\n5.1 Freedom in Heaven\n\nLike the arguments over universalism and human freedom, as briefly\nsummarized in section 4.2 above, the issue of freedom in heaven once\nagain illustrates the need for a reasonably clear and complete account\nof free will. It also illustrates how easily a purely verbal dispute,\nwhich is an apparent dispute that arises from different uses of the\nsame term, can sometimes disguise itself as a genuine disagreement\nover some matter of substance. With respect to the issue of freedom in\nheaven, here are a couple of additional examples to consider: (a) the\nhonest banker whose deeply-rooted moral and religious convictions make\nit psychologically impossible for him to accept a bribe in a given\nsituation, and (b) the mother whose great love for her newborn baby\nmakes it psychologically impossible for her knowingly to harm her\nbeloved child physically. The question of whether there is freedom in\nheaven seems relevantly similar to the question of whether our honest\nbanker freely refuses the bribe and whether our loving mother\nfreely refuses to do anything she knows would harm her baby\nphysically. \n\nConsider now three different non-compatibilist accounts of what it\nmeans to act freely and the implications that each of these\naccounts has for the possibility of freedom in heaven. According to\nthe first account, briefly introduced in section 3.1 above, freedom\nalways requires that PAP obtain; that is, one is free with respect to\nsome action A in a given set of circumstances only if it is within\none\u2019s power to do A in that set of circumstances and also within\none\u2019s power to refrain from doing A. So if no one in heaven, as\nChristians typically understand it, will ever have the slightest\ninclination to disobey God\u2014if, that is, it would be as\npsychologically impossible for the saints in heaven to disobey God as\nit would be for our loving mother to torture her beloved baby to\ndeath, then there can be no freedom of that kind in heaven.\nThis is not a matter for dispute; it is instead merely a matter of\nbeing clear about a specified use of the term \u201cfreedom.\u201d\nEither the saints in heaven retain a robust power to disobey God and\nto sin, or they do not have the kind of freedom that PAP specifies.\nOr, to put it another way: if the saints in heaven do have this kind\nof freedom even as Lucifer, according to one traditional\ninterpretation of his supposed fall from perfection, was able to\ncommit the primal sin in heaven, then they also retain the power to\nsin in heaven (see Matheson 2018, 66). \n\nA second account carries no implication that having the relevant\nfreedom in the present always requires an ability to do otherwise\nin the present, though it does require an ability to do\notherwise at various times in one\u2019s life history. For according\nto Robert Kane, \u201cAgents with free will . . . must be such that\nthey could have done otherwise on some occasions of their life\nhistories with respect to some character- or motive-forming acts by\nwhich they make themselves into the kinds of persons they are\u201d\n(Kane 1998, 72). In a similar vein, James F. Sennett defends the free\nwill of the saints in heaven by in effect arguing that they have\nfreely chosen their own moral character. \u201cA character that is\nlibertarian freely chosen,\u201d he therefore suggests, \u201cis the\nonly kind of character that can determine compatibilist free\nchoices\u201d (Sennett 1999, 74; and for a similar view, albeit\ntweaked a bit, see Pawl and Timpe 2008). The basic idea here seems to\nbe that one\u2019s own motives and character can determine a free\naction in the present only when one is fully responsible for the\nmotives and character traits that determine this action. \n\nA possible difficulty here is to provide a coherent account, not to\nmention an empirically verifiable account, of how certain undetermined\nchoices buried in a life history might render one responsible for\none\u2019s present motives and character traits. This is a problem in\npart because, as Manuel Vargas points out, \u201ceven freely chosen\nfeatures of our lives and ourselves can, because of our epistemic\nlimitations, yield unanticipated consequences\u201d (Vargas 2005,\n282)\u2014as, for instance, when someone sincerely cultivates moral\nintegrity and inadvertently produces some of the worst character\ntraits: moral rigidity, self-righteousness, and a lack of compassion.\nSimilarly, someone\u2019s worst choices and the lessons learned from\nthem may be the very thing that has the most profound effect on the\ndevelopment of a good character. So given our epistemic limitations\nand the unanticipated consequences of our free choices, is it any\nwonder that many Christian theologians view a good character as a gift\nfrom God rather than as something for which we can credit ourselves?\n\n\nA third account of freedom, sometimes neglected by those who emphasize\nthe importance of human freedom, is Susan Wolf\u2019s Reason View,\naccording to which \u201cthe freedom necessary for responsibility\nconsists in the ability (or freedom) to do the right thing for the\nright reasons\u201d (Wolf 1990, 94). But unlike the autonomy view, as\nshe calls it, such freedom does not require the ability to refrain\nfrom doing the right thing for the right reasons. Wolf thus commits\nherself to the following asymmetry: whereas committing a wrong (or\nimmoral) act freely requires an ability to do otherwise and\ntherefore to refrain from acting wrongly, doing the right thing for\nthe right reasons freely does not require an ability to act\notherwise. Such a view takes full advantage of the idea, expressed in\nsection 3.1 above, that the relevant freedom requires a minimal degree\nof rationality, and it might be modified slightly as follows. If a\nrelevant threshold of rationality requires only an ability to make\nreasonable judgments, rather than infallible ones, concerning the best\ncourse of action, then perhaps we can say that freedom consists in the\nability to follow one\u2019s own reasonable judgment concerning the\nbest course of action in a given situation (see Talbott 2009, 388).\nWhether one accepts such a modification or not, something like\nWolf\u2019s Reason View seems to accord perfectly with the religious\nview that those in heaven are the freest of all created persons, even\nas those in hell remain in bondage to sin (a bondage similar to an\nalcoholic\u2019s bondage to alcohol). Such a view also seems to\naccord perfectly with St. Paul\u2019s view that salvation is a means\nby which the will is released from its bondage to sin. \n5.2 Concerning the Misery of Loved Ones in Hell\n\nAssuming that love ties people\u2019s interests together in the way\ndescribed in section 4.1 above, one might then wonder how God could\npreserve the happiness of those in heaven who know that some of their\nown loved ones are suffering forever in hell. For the question\ninevitably arises, \u201cHow could anyone remain happy knowing that a\ngenuine loved one, however corrupted, is destined to be miserable\nforever\u201d. When a reporter asked the mother of Ted\nBundy, a serial murderer of young women, whether she could still\nsupport a son who had become a monster, her answer provided a poignant\nillustration of the problem. \u201cOf course I support him,\u201d\nshe declared, as her eyes filled with tears and her body literally\nbegan shaking. \u201cHe is my son. I love him. I have to support\nhim.\u201d She obviously did not support his monstrous crimes, and\nneither did she even object to the severity of his punishment. But\nstill, one wonders how this suffering woman\u2014a committed\nChristian, by the way\u2014could ever achieve supreme happiness\nknowing that the son she continued to love was destined to be lost\nforever without any future hope of redemption.\n\nSuch considerations have led some, including the 19th\nCentury theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, to argue that the misery\nof those in hell would undermine altogether the blessedness of the\nredeemed in heaven (see Schleiermacher 1830, 721\u2013722; Kronen and\nReitan 2011, 80\u201389; and Talbott 1990b, 237\u2013241). But\nothers have argued that God could always shield forever the redeemed\nin heaven from painful memories of the lost in hell. William Lane\nCraig thus raises the possibility that God could simply\n\u201cobliterate\u201d from the minds of the redeemed \u201cany\nknowledge of lost persons so that they experience no pangs of remorse\nfor them\u201d (Craig, 1991, 306). Given the widespread theological\nview, which Craig seems to accept, that billions of people will\neventually be lost forever, one issue here concerns how much of some\npeople\u2019s minds, particularly those whose entire family is lost\nforever, God would have to wipe out in order to accomplish such a\nstrategy. Another concerns how God, as an infinitely loving being,\nmight expunge the infinitely more painful memories from his own mind.\nBut the main issue to be resolved here is whether blissful\nignorance qualifies as a worthwhile form of happiness at all.\n\nAs a matter of historical fact, in any case, some of the most\ninfluential theologians in the Western tradition, including some who\nare widely admired as heroes of faith, have not only made an eternal\ntorture chamber an important part of their teaching about hell; they\nseem also to have gloried in the idea that the torments of those\nwrithing in hell forever will increase the joy of those in heaven.\nJonathan Edwards thus wrote: \u201cWhen the saints in glory \u2026\nshall see how miserable others of their fellow-creatures are, who were\nnaturally in the same circumstances with themselves; when they shall\nsee the smoke of their torment, and the raging of the flames of their\nburning, and hear their dolorous shrieks and cries, and consider that\nthey [the saints] in the mean time are in the most blissful state and\nshall surely be in it to all eternity; how will they rejoice!\u201d\n(Edwards 1834, sec. II\n [available online]).\n Remarkably, Edwards was also a theological determinist who held that\nGod determined from the beginning to bring a huge number of people to\na horrific end and did so for the precise purpose of increasing the\njoy of the elect in heaven. He even insisted, contra Craig,\nthat the inhabitants of heaven and hell will be acutely aware of each\nother\u2019s condition; so even as the torments of former loved ones\nin hell will contribute to the joy of those in heaven, so the joy of\nformer loved ones in heaven will contribute to the psychological\ntorment of those in hell. He thus made the following kind of warning\nan important part of his preaching: \u201cHow will you bear to see\nyour parents, who in this life had so dear an affection for you, now\nwithout any love to you \u2026 How will you bear to see and hear\nthem praising the Judge, for his justice exercised in pronouncing this\nsentence, and hearing it with holy joy in their countenances, and\nshouting forth the praises and hallelujahs of God and Christ on that\naccount?\u201d (sec. IV).\n\nAs horrifying as such descriptions are apt to appear to someone such\nas Ted Bundy\u2019s mother, perhaps all parties can agree on one\nthing at least. If justice were to require that one suffer\neternally for sins that God himself causally determined, then such\nsuffering would have to be a source of satisfaction, if not outright\nbliss, on the part of any fair-minded person witnessing it. But since,\nas they say, one person\u2019s modus ponens is another\u2019s modus\n tollens,[12]\n a critic of Edwards will simply reply in the following way. No\nfair-minded person would find satisfaction in someone\u2019s\nexperiencing eternal torment as punishment for even the worst of sins,\nparticularly in the case of sins that God himself has causally\ndetermined; therefore, such torment is not what justice requires.\nAccording to Edwards\u2019s own theology, moreover, he was no less\ndeserving of eternal torment himself than are those who suffer in\nhell. Schleiermacher and many others therefore find it hard to\nunderstand how those who receive special favor in this regard could be\nso deliriously happy in the knowledge that some of their own loved\nones do not receive a similar special\n favor.[13]\n\n5.3 Concerning the Supposed Tedium of Immortality\n\nA third issue concerning heaven that sometimes arises is whether\neverlasting bliss is even a possible state of affairs. Bernard\nWilliams has thus suggested \u201cthat immortality would be, where\nconceivable at all, intolerable\u201d (in Fischer 1993, 73).\nCommenting on a play by Karel Capek about a women who at age 42\nreceives immortality and by age 342 no longer wants to live, Williams\nwrote: \u201cHer trouble was, it seems, boredom: a boredom connected\nwith the fact that everything that could happen and make sense to one\nhuman being of 42 had already happened to her\u201d by age 342\n(82).\n\nSuch a statement is reminiscent of a quotation often attributed to\nCharles H. Duell, who became commissioner of the U.S. patent office in\n1898. According to legend, Duell declared that everything that can be\ninvented has already been invented; and even though this wonderful\nstory is probably apocryphal, it nonetheless illustrates in a humorous\nway the possible consequences of an impoverished imagination. It would\nhardly take even 30 years, depending upon the circumstances, for a\ngiven life to become dull and insipid. But the idea that a healthy\nperson could exhaust all the possibilities for adventure and\nmeaningful experience in a mere 300 years will strike many as simply\npreposterous. A mere 300 years is virtually nothing, it is true, when\ncompared to a life without end. So the real issue is whether it is\nlogically possible that an unending life (in which one retains\none\u2019s identity as the same person) should be filled with\nunending joy and ever increasing opportunities for novel and\nmeaningful experiences.\n\nAddressing this very issue, John Martin Fischer writes:\n\u201cRemember [the possibility] that certain \u2026 of one\u2019s\nfamily and friends also have the relevant sort of immortality. It\nseems to me that under such circumstances one could live an attractive\nlife characterized by a desirable mix of fulfilling\nactivities\u201d (Fischer 1993, 10\u2014his italics). Might not an\nunending life even increase the possibilities for such a\ndesirable mix? A favorite symphony not heard for a hundred years or so\nmight be experienced as utterly fresh and exciting. And even if we set\naside anything that might raise a controversy about personal identity,\nthe mere discovery of an unexpected means of traversing our\nextravagant universe, with its billions of galaxies and billions of\nstar systems within each of them, might open up\u2014for adventurous\nspirits anyway\u2014incredible possibilities for new and exciting\nexperiences. Nor should we ignore the further possibility of\nexperiencing infinitely many other realms and universes that are not\nspatially contiguous with our own. Pursuing Fischer\u2019s idea of a\ndesirable mix even further, a longer life could also increase the\nchances for the experience of boredom itself to fit into a larger\ncontext of meaningful experience. In caring for her baby, for example,\na mother typically performs many mundane tasks that might seem utterly\ntedious were it not for the joy of interacting with her baby and of\nwatching it grow and flourish. Similarly, St. Paul found even the\ntedium of prison to be tolerable, so he claimed, because he saw it as\npart of a larger story that he believed to be both true and glorious.\nSo why allow, many religious people would ask, an impoverished\nimagination to exclude the very possibility of an over-arching story\narc perpetually giving fresh meaning to our individual lives?\n\nStill, all of that having been said, Williams\u2019s view concerning\nthe inevitably tedious nature of an unending life is not that far\nremoved from the religious view that in our present unperfected\ncondition we are not yet fit for eternity and not yet capable of\nexperiencing the most worthwhile forms of happiness; indeed, given our\npresent condition, some would claim, we might even turn heaven itself\ninto a hellish experience. And if that be true, then the task of\nrendering someone fit for eternal joy may be far more complicated,\neven for an omnipotent being, than one might have imagined. As many\nreligions including Christianity teach, we must first learn to love\nproperly before we can experience enduring happiness, and this\nrequires that we also be purged of all selfish tendencies, all lust\nfor power over others, every temptation to benefit ourselves at the\nexpense of others, and anything else that might separate one person\nfrom another. Right here, of course, is where Williams would question\nwhether a suitably transformed person would be the same individual as\nthe unperfected person that existed previously. But none of our moral\nimperfections, a religious person might retort, can coherently be\nnumbered among our essential properties\u2014as if we could never\nprogress morally and never learn to become more loving persons. So\nhere, perhaps, is the sum of the matter from a religious perspective:\nthe more self-absorbed we become, the more tedious and dreary our\nlives inevitably become over time. But the more outwardly focused we\nbecome in loving relationships, the more joyful and meaningful our\nlives also become over time.\n\nIn any case, the controversies associated with Williams\u2019s\nunderstanding of immortality are also relevant to the problem of evil.\nFor the same considerations that lead some to wonder whether\nimmortality would eventually become dreadfully boring may also lead\nsome of the religious to consider favorably the following hypothesis.\nFor all we know, an environment such as the one we live in\u2014an\nenvironment in which one encounters real threats and dangers of a\ntemporary kind, where one person\u2019s temporary welfare may depend\nupon the choices of others and upon natural forces over which one has\nlimited or no control, where a quest for truth and genuine discoveries\nabout the glories of God\u2019s creation are possible, and where\nmoral failure would likely provide ample opportunities for repentance,\nforgiveness, and atonement\u2014for all we know, such an environment\nis an important part of the process whereby God renders us fit for\neternal joy. Although the problem of evil is the subject of another\nentry (see the entry on\n The Problem of Evil),\n the relevant point for the topic of heaven is just this: one need not\nthink of heaven (or the coming age, as the Gospel writers sometimes\nrefer to it) as a static ethereal realm in which there is nothing to\ndo. One might instead suppose that God will never stop creating\nadditional persons to love and additional realms for us to experience\nand that we will always have important roles to play, as Paul hinted\nin Ephesians 2:7, in this ongoing process of creation and\nrevelation.\n",
