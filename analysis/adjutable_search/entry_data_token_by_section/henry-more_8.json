    "main_text": "Necessitarian Theology and New Threats\n9. Posthumous Reputation\n\nIt seems fair to say that although More had a small number of\nlike-minded and devoted followers during his own lifetime, his\nphilosophical theology was for the most part regarded with suspicion\nby his contemporaries. Even some of those who had been tutored by him,\nand who admired him personally, most notably John Finch and Anne\nConway, could not go along with his claims about the necessity of a\ndualistic ontology. For those who failed to share More\u2019s\nnecessitarian theology, such as Boyle and Baxter, More\u2019s views\nwere dangerous to religion. There were others, however, who believed\nthat More\u2019s dichotomy between passive matter and active spirit\nwas invaluable for combatting atheism. It was More\u2019s\nanti-atheistic stratagem which lay behind the rejection of John\nLocke\u2019s speculation about the possibility of thinking matter by\nthe Bishop of Worcester, Edward Stillingfleet (1635\u20131699). If\nmatter could think, then the dichotomy between passive matter and\nactive spirit did not hold, and it would be impossible (the Bishop\nthought) to use the presence of activity in the world to establish the\nexistence of a necessarily spiritual realm. Locke, like Baxter, merely\nobjected that Stillingfleet\u2019s insistence that not even God could\nmake matter capable of thinking, undermined God\u2019s omnipotence,\nand thereby was likely to undermine the faith (Henry 2011). Samuel\nClarke took More\u2019s distinction between inert matter and active\nspirit even further, insisting that not even God could endow bodies\nwith active powers, and developing what has been called \u201cpartial\noccasionalism\u201d (Sangiacomo 2018). Effectively, therefore, where\nnatural phenomena were concerned, Clarke replaced More\u2019s Spirit\nof Nature, \u201cthe vicarious Power of God\u201d, with the direct\naction of God himself, or his angels (Henry 2020; see also Thomas\n2018).\n\nIt was only really after his death that More\u2019s reputation began\nto rise, at least in Britain. There was renewed interest in his\nwritings in the early eighteenth century, when More\u2019s\ncombination of rationalism with a passionate, almost enthusiastic,\nfaith must have proved heartening to churchmen living in an age of\ndeism. The natural theology which flourished in the age after Isaac\nNewton led to an increased emphasis on rationalism in religion but it\nwas important for the clergy to avoid descending into deism, and to\ncombine their natural theologies with a belief in Scripture, and with\nwhat More would have called the \u201cGrand Mysteries\u201d of\nreligion. His reputation was also helped by the fact that he was seen\nas a prominent member of the early Latitudinarians, and as this\nrational and liberal approach to belief became dominant, More could be\nseen as one of the movement\u2019s heroes. Furthermore, while More\nhad been trying to promote necessitarian theology at a time when\nvoluntarist theology was very much in the ascendant (especially in\nCalvinist countries), the eighteenth century saw a reversal, and\nnecessitarian theology came to the fore, as represented seriously in\nAlexander Pope\u2019s Essay on Man, and satirically in\nVoltaire\u2019s Candide. As the eighteenth century\nprogressed More\u2019s reputation as a theologian, if not as a\nphilosopher, became assured and it has remained high ever since\n(Taliaferro 2005).\n\nIn more recent scholarship More has been seen as a significant\ninfluence upon Isaac Newton, particularly his ideas on absolute space,\nand this, together with his role in introducing Cartesianism into\nEngland, has assured his continual inclusion in histories of science\nof the period. Newton certainly knew More personally in Cambridge, and\nowned and read a significant number of More\u2019s books. A\nmanuscript copy of the correspondence between More and Descartes,\ncompiled before Clerselier\u2019s edition of Descartes\u2019s\ncorrespondence (1657), has recently been found among Newton\u2019s\npersonal papers (Hutton 2020). They also shared a profound interest in\nthe interpretation of the prophetic scriptures (Hutton 1994). It seems\nundeniable that Newton read and was influenced by More\u2019s views\non space and time, as presented in the Enchiridion\nmetaphysicum (Koyr\u00e9 1957, Grant 1981, Hall 1990). Like\nMore, Newton also believed that for something to exist it must exist\nin space, and he identified the immensity of infinite space with the\nextension of God (Grant 1981). Similarly, in the \u201cGeneral\nScholium\u201d, which he added to the second edition of his\nPrincipia mathematica (1713), Newton wrote that God \u201cby\nexisting always and everywhere he constitutes duration and space,\neternity, and infinity\u201d (Newton 1999, 941; Hall 1990, Henry\n1993). It seems certain that Newton took some salient ideas from More,\nbut he was by no means a complete disciple. It is highly unlikely that\nNewton would have admired More\u2019s natural philosophy, and\ncertainly, like Boyle, Hooke, and other natural philosophers, he\nrejected More\u2019s Spirit of Nature. Nor did they share similar\nreligious views. Newton disagreed with More\u2019s interpretation of\nthe Book of Daniel and the Revelation, and Newton was very much a\nvoluntarist in his theology and so would have been opposed to\nMore\u2019s necessitarianism (Henry 1990). Even so, the similarities\nbetween their views of space and time, and their relationship to God,\nguarantees More\u2019s place in the history of science. Moreover,\nMore\u2019s position in the history of philosophy, and in the history\nof relations between science and religion, is secure.\n",
