    "main_text": "Asymmetrical Existential Dependence\n3. Asymmetrical Existential Dependence\n\nWhere does the above analysis of existential dependence lead us? The\ncase of Socrates\u2019s life demonstrates that\n (EDR)\n permits the possibility of mutual existential\ndependenceR between non-identical things. But this\nimplication does not seem to be acceptable in every context and indeed\nsymmetric dependence more generally is a controversial issue (see\nBarnes 2018 for discussion). Take, again, the relationship between\nSocrates and his life. According to (EDR), Socrates is quite as much\nexistentially dependentR upon his life as his life is upon\nhim. And yet there is a strong intuition that, in another and perhaps\nmore important sense, Socrates\u2019s life is the truly\ndependent object here, while Socrates is, in some sense, an\nindependent existent. We might say that Socrates\u2019s life\nexists only because Socrates does, whereas it would be\nputting the cart before the horse to say that Socrates exists\nbecause his life does. Now, it appears that the conjunction\n\u201cbecause\u201d must be asymmetrical, because it\nexpresses an explanatory relationship and explanation is\nasymmetrical. Plausibly, two distinct states of affairs cannot\nexplain each other. There may, quite conceivably, be\nself-explanatory states of affairs, so we should only want to\nurge that non-identical states of affairs cannot be mutually\nexplanatory. Technically, this means that we should strictly describe\nexplanation as an \u201cantisymmetric\u201d rather than as an\nasymmetric relation. The asymmetry of explanation is, of course,\nintimately related to the unacceptability of circular\narguments. It is also closely linked to recent discussions\nregarding metaphysical grounding, to which we will return\nlater, in\n \u00a75.\n\nOne upshot of all this is that, for the purpose of defining\nontologically independent existents (if there are any), (EDR)\nshould be replaced, at least to a first approximation, by something\nlike:\n\n(EDX)\n x dependsX for its existence upon y\n=df Necessarily, x exists only because y\nexists.\n\n\nWe use the subscript \u201cX\u201d because, in line with foregoing\nremarks, it seems appropriate to call this species of ontological\ndependence eXplanatory existential dependence. (We shall need\nthe subscript \u201cE\u201d for another use later.) Here it is\nimportant to note that the presence of the word \u201conly\u201d in\n(EDX)\u2019s definiens should not be understood as implying\nthat an object x may not dependX for its existence\nupon two (or more) different things, y and z.\nThus the particularized relation of Mary\u2019s loving\nTom\u2014supposing such an object to exist\u2014plausibly exists\nonly because Mary exists, but plausibly also exists\nonly because Tom exists. Furthermore, we may assume that it\nis not an implication of (EDX) that a composite object\ndependsX for its existence upon its proper parts, that is,\nthat it is not the case that it \u201cexists only because\nthey exist\u201d\u2014on the grounds that it could still exist in\nthe absence of those particular parts, provided suitable\nalternative parts were substituted for them. Thus (EDX) is quite\nunlike\n (EDG)\n in its implications for part-whole dependence relations, as far as\ncomposite objects are concerned. For the same reason, we may assume\nthat (EDX) does not imply that an \u201cAristotelian\u201d universal\ndependsX for its existence upon its particular exemplars.\nIndeed, we may take it that the definiens of (EDX) entails\nthe definiens of\n (EDR)\u2014although\n not vice versa, of course\u2014so that the following is a\nprinciple that one could accept:\n\n(B-NEC)\nIf, necessarily, x exists only because y\nexists, then, necessarily, x exists only if y\nexists.\n\n\nHowever, despite these clarifications, it must be conceded that the\nlocution \u201cx exists only because y exists\u201d is\nhardly very perspicuous, either as to its logical form or as to its\nexact meaning. Moreover, precisely because we have introduced the\nconjunction \u201cbecause\u201d as an explanatory\nconjunction, it may be felt that it is not well-suited to the\nontological role now being devised for it (for one of the many recent\nattempts to specify the explanatory role of \u201cbecause\u201d, see\ndeRosset 2013). There are perhaps two sources of worry here: first,\nthat this approach invites a confusion between metaphysics and\nepistemology; and secondly (but relatedly) that contexts governed by\nthe conjunction \u201cbecause\u201d are opaque (in the\ntechnical sense of the term, in which it implies the non-applicability\nof Leibniz\u2019s Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles).\n\nSome of these worries can perhaps be allayed by resorting to the\nrecent work on metaphysical grounding, which presents a much more\nrigorous analysis of non-causal, metaphysical explanation of this type\n(see especially the articles in Correia & Schnieder (eds.) 2012a).\nThis is not to take any stand on the relationship between grounding\nand metaphysical explanation (see \u00a74 of the separate entry on\n metaphysical grounding),\n but only to note that the discussion surrounding explanatory\ndependence has progressed, in part, independently of the wider\nconsiderations surrounding ontological dependence. So we should\nperhaps accept that\n (EDX)\n as it stands does not really constitute a satisfactory definition of\na species of existential dependence, conceived as an objective\nmetaphysical relation between entities, because it is insufficiently\nperspicuous. In any case, the fact that (B-NEC) but not its\nconverse holds some appeal indicates that what we should be trying to\nframe is a perspicuous definition of a species of ontological\ndependence that is a relation between x and y\nstronger than (entailing but not entailed by)\n\u201cnecessarily, x exists only if y exists\u201d.\nThis should moreover be (for reasons discussed earlier) an\nasymmetrical relation\u2014or, more accurately, an\nantisymmetric relation, that is, a relation \\(\\Rrel\\) such\nthat if \\(x\\Rrel y\\) and \\(y\\Rrel x\\), then \\(x = y\\). This is to\nallow that in principle an object may, in the anticipated sense,\ndepend ontologically upon itself, controversial as this may\nbe (it is nevertheless a position that is of at least historical\ninterest, e.g., because of the potential special case of God depending\non herself).\n\nAs we shall see in a moment, a relation that may be of some assistance\nin spelling out the relevant sense of dependence is the relation of\nidentity-dependence, to be explained below. But first we\nshould digress for a moment to note that the one-sided\nholding of the relation defined by\n (EDR)\n is unlikely to do the job. According to this suggestion, we have:\n\n(EDA)\n x dependsA for its existence upon y\n=df\n\n(i)\n necessarily, x exists only if y exists and \n(ii)\n it is not the case that, necessarily, y exists\nonly if x exists.\n \n\n\nNotice that the relation thus defined is asymmetric (rather\nthan antisymmetric): it doesn\u2019t permit any object to be\nexistentially dependent upon itself. Indeed, we have chosen\nto use the subscript \u201cA\u201d here because the relation in\nquestion may aptly be called asymmetrical rigid existential\ndependence. One might think that this is at it should be, as on the\nface of it the idea of something existentially depending on itself\nappears very strange. There is of course an obvious theological\ncandidate that may violate this condition, namely God, so perhaps we\nshould not rule out the possibility outright. But there may be\nslightly less controversial candidates as well, for it could be\nsuggested that there are fundamental entities that\nexistentially depend on themselves (rather than on nothing). At any\nrate, if anything of the sort is possible, we better not rule it out\nby definition, as (EDA) does.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, an appeal to (EDA) does not seem to help to\nresolve the difficulty raised by the example of Socrates\u2019s life.\nFor neither Socrates nor his life is existentially\ndependentA on the other, since in neither case is clause\n(ii) of (EDA) satisfied. But we were looking for a sense of\n\u201contologically dependent\u201d in which it is true to\nsay that Socrates\u2019s life is ontologically dependent upon\nhim, but not vice versa.\n",
