    "main_text": "Life and Writings || Philolaus\u2019 Book: Genuine Fragments and Testimonia\n1.3 Philolaus\u2019 Book: Genuine Fragments and Testimonia\n\nIt is important to distinguish between two traditions regarding\nPhilolaus\u2019 publication of books (Burkert 1972a, 223\u20137; Huffman\n1993, 12\u201315). In one tradition, which is likely to be reliable,\nPhilolaus is reported to have published a single book, which came to\nbear the traditional title for all Presocratic philosophical\ntreatises, On Nature, although it is doubtful that this title\ngoes back to Philolaus himself. This tradition is found in Diogenes\nLaertius (VIII 85) but goes back to Hermippus (3rd BC) and\nTimon (DK 44 A8; 320\u2013230 BC). Diogenes quotes the first sentence\nof this book, and it is likely that it was available to Aristotle and\nhis pupil Meno in the fourth century (see section 1.2 above). This\ntradition also suggests that Plato cribbed the Timaeus from\nPhilolaus\u2019 book. The accusation of plagiarism on Plato\u2019s part is\nabsurd, but there are enough general similarities between the\nTimaeus and Philolaus\u2019 book to explain the origin of the\naccusation (e.g., the musical scale which Plato uses in the\nconstruction of the world soul corresponds to the scale in Philolaus,\nFr. 6a). This book of Philolaus is also likely to be the first book\npublished in the Pythagorean tradition. Diogenes asserts that\nPhilolaus was the first Pythagorean to publish a treatise on nature\n(VIII 85). Pythagoras wrote nothing, and we are told that the same is\ntrue of Philolaus\u2019 immediate predecessor in the Pythagorean tradition,\nHippasus (D. L. VIII 84). Some scholars argue that there were books by\nPythagoreans earlier than Philolaus (Zhmud 1989 and 2012: 121\u20139), but,\nwhere there is clear evidence for a book, it is unlikely that the\nfigure is a Pythagorean (e.g. Alcmaeon) and, where the figure is\nclearly a Pythagorean, there is no explicit evidence for a book (e.g.\nHippasus). A second tradition reports that Plato bought three books\nfrom Philolaus (D. L. III 9; VIII 15 and 84). It is implied that these\nbooks were not by Philolaus himself, and it seems likely that the\nstatement refers to three spurious works assigned to Pythagoras at\nD.L. VIII 6\u00a0 (Burkert 1972a, 224\u20135). The story of Plato\u2019s\npurchase of these books from Philolaus was probably invented to\nauthenticate the three forged treatises of Pythagoras.\n\nBurkert\u2019s arguments (1972a, 238\u2013277), supported by further\nstudy (Huffman 1993), have led to a consensus that some 11 fragments\nare genuine (Frs. 1\u20136, 6a, 7, 13, 16 and 17) and derive from\nPhilolaus\u2019 book On Nature (Barnes 1982; Kahn 1993 and\n2001; Kirk, Raven and Schofield 1983; Nussbaum 1979; Zhmud 2012,\nGraham 2014). Fragments 1, 6a and 13 are identified as coming from the\nbook On Nature by ancient sources. Stobaeus cites fragments 2\nand 4\u20137 as coming from a work On the Cosmos, but this\nappears to be an alternate title for On Nature, which\nprobably arose because the chapter heading in Stobaeus under which the\nfragments are cited is \u2018On the Cosmos.\u2019 Testimonia A7a,\nA9, A10, A16 (part), A17 (part), A18\u201324, A27\u20139 are also\ngenerally agreed to reflect the contents of On Nature. The\nauthenticity of some fragments and testimonia remains\ncontroversial. Fr. 6b and Testimonium A 26, which, in contrast to\nFr. 6a, take a numerological approach rather than a properly\nmathematical approach to music theory, were accepted as authentic by\nBurkert (1972a, 394\u2013400; followed by Mueller 1997, 292\u20133),\nwhereas Huffman argues that they are spurious (1993, 364\u201374;\nfollowed by Zhmud 1997, 185). Recent scholarship on harmonic theory\nargues that the conflict in approach may be less significant than it\nappears at first sight (see the end of section 2.2 below) and that 6b\nand A26 may thus be authentic (Barker 2007: 271; Hagel 2009:\n143\u2013151). Similarly, Burkert accepts A 14 as genuine and as\nrepresenting the earliest evidence for horoscopic astrology in Greece\n(1972a, 350), whereas Huffman argues against authenticity (1993,\n381\u201391).\n",
