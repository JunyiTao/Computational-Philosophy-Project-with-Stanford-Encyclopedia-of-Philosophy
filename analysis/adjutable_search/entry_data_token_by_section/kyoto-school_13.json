Relating the \u201cideal\u201d world of\nphilosophy to the \u201creal\u201d world of political action is a\nperilous, if arguably obligatory, undertaking.\n\nThe pitfalls of political intervention are particularly deep when\nphilosophers find themselves in a nation headed down a road toward\ninjustice and disaster. What is a philosopher to do in such a\nsituation? Barring straightforward complicity, there appear to be\nthree choices: withdraw into reclusion, stand up in overt\nresistance, or attempt to negotiate a reorientation by means\nof immanent critique or cooperative correction.\nWhile many intellectuals in wartime Japan took the first course, some\ncourageous Leftists braved the second course. Both Tosaka Jun and Miki\nKiyoshi, the key figures of what is sometimes called the \u201cleft\nwing of the Kyoto School,\u201d died in prison in 1945 as a result of\ntheir intellectual resistance. The majority of the Kyoto School\nthinkers, however, including Nishida, Tanabe, and Nishitani, took the\nthird course of action.\n\nIn retrospect Nishitani wrote: \u201cMy attempt was, on the one hand,\nto explain where Japan was situated within the world to those\nintellectuals remaining on the sidelines [of politics]; and, on the\nother hand, with respect to the extremely nationalistic thought that\nwas becoming increasingly prevalent at the time, I attempted from\nwithin to open up a path for overcoming this extreme\nnationalism\u201d (NKC IV, 384). Rather than either stand up and die,\nor sit out and wait, Nishitani and other members of the Kyoto School\nattempted to walk the razor\u2019s edge of what \u014chashi\nRy\u014dsuke has called \u201canti-establishment cooperation\u201d\nor \u201ccooperative resistance\u201d (hantaiseiteki\nky\u014dryoku) (see \u014chashi 2001, 20ff.).\n\nTo be sure, the question of how successfully the Kyoto School managed\nto carry out this \u201ccooperative resistance\u201d (and the\nquestion of whether they cooperated more than resisted) is debatable,\nespecially given the fact that they did not succeed in altering the\ndisastrous orientation of the regime. Their intentions of cooperative\nresistance notwithstanding, the fact is that their political writings\nwere more or less successfully co-opted by the extreme nationalism\nthat they were more or less trying to reorient or overcome from\nwithin. Nevertheless, we must take care to separate their ideals from\nthe reality they were attempting to influence, and bear in mind the\nconstraints of their chosen path of immanent critique.\n\nWhatever the political failings of the Kyoto School thinkers may be,\nit is clear that certain crudely one-sided condemnations are at least\nas simplistic and misleading as are the occasional attempts of\noverzealous acolytes to whitewash everything they ever said or wrote.\nIt is, for example, highly misleading to sum up the Kyoto\nSchool\u2019s various philosophies of history as \u201ca thinly\ndisguised justification \u2026 for Japanese aggression and\ncontinuing imperialism,\u201d or to claim that \u201cno group helped\ndefend the state more consistently and enthusiastically \u2026 and\nnone came closer \u2026 to defining the philosophic contours of\nJapanese fascism\u201d (Najita & Harootunian 1998, 238\u201339;\nfor a severe critique of such polemical claims, see Parkes 1997 and\n2011). The latter dishonor, namely that of attempting to give\nquasi-philosophical expression to Japanese fascism, surely goes to the\nproponents of \u201cImperial Way Philosophy,\u201d who in fact\nharshly attacked the \u201cworld-historical philosophy\u201d of the\nKyoto School for being insufficiently Japan-centric (see \u014chashi\n2001, 71\u201372).\n\nJudicious critics of the wartime political writings of the Kyoto\nSchool must surely try to steer a middle course between and beyond\nwhat James Heisig aptly calls the \u201cside-steppers and the\nside-swipers\u201d (see Heisig 1990, 14). With this balance in mind,\nin the following sections let me highlight some of the key points and\nepisodes of the Kyoto School\u2019s wartime political ventures and\nmisadventures.\n",
