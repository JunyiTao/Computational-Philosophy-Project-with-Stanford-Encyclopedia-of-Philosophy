    "main_text": "Views which Undermine the Debate: Quietism\n9. Concluding Remarks and Apologies\n\nThis discussion of realism and of the forms that non-realist\nopposition may take is far from exhaustive, and aims only to give the\nreader a sense of what to expect if they delve deeper into the issues.\nIn particular, nothing has been mentioned about the work of Hilary\nPutnam, his characterisation of \u2018metaphysical realism\u2019,\nand his so-called \u2018model-theoretic\u2019 argument against it.\nPutnam\u2019s writings are extensive, but one could begin with Putnam\n1981 and 1983. For critical discussion, see Hale and Wright 2017 and\nWright 2001; see also the entries on\n scientific realism\n and\n challenges to metaphysical realism.\n Nor have issues about the metaphysics of modality and possible worlds\nbeen discussed. The locus classicus in this area is Lewis 1986. For\ncommentary, see Divers 2002 and Melia 2003; see also the entries on\n David Lewis\u2019s metaphysics\n and the\n epistemology of modality.\n And the very important topic of scientific realism has not been\ntouched upon. For an introductory treatment and suggestions for\nfurther reading, see Bird 1998 Ch. 4; see also, the entries on\n scientific realism\n and\n structural realism.\n Finally, it has not been possible to include any discussion of\nrealism about intentionality and meaning (but see the entries on\n intentionality\n and\n theories of meaning.)\n The locus classicus in recent philosophy is Kripke 1982. For a\nrobustly realistic view of the intentional, see Fodor 1987. For a\ncollection of some of the central secondary literature, see Miller and\nWright 2002, and for a robust defence of Kripke\u2019s interpretation\nof Wittgenstein, see Kusch (2006). For an entertaining defence of\nmetaphysical realism, see Musgrave 2001 (exercise for the reader: do\nany of the forms of opposition to realism described in this entry rely\non what Musgrave calls word-magic?). For an alternative approach to\nmapping the debates about realism involving conceptions of\nindependence more distinctively metaphysical than those focussed on\nhere, see Fine (2001) and the entry on\n metaphysical grounding.\n For good introductory book length treatments of realism, see Kirk\n1999 and Brock and Mares 2006. Greenough and Lynch (2006) is a useful\ncollection of papers by many of the leading lights in the various\ndebates about realism. \n",
