    "main_text": "The Essay on Education || The Formation of Character\n6.2 The Formation of Character\nMill\u2019s Education (and Analysis) was criticized for blending together two different projects: epistemology and psychology. The confusion, Wyndham Hedley Burston argued, was due to Mill\u2019s failure to acknowledge the synthetic/analytic or conceptual/empirical distinction (Burston 1973, chs. 5\u20136; Wilson 1990, ch. 4), a critique which was also levelled at his son\u2019s A System of Logic. However, given that epistemology concerns itself, not only with what knowledge is, but also with questions such as how it can be attained and with which cognitive processes do actually allow the attainment of knowledge, James Mill\u2019s enterprise in both Education and Analysis might not appear as suspect as on first glance from a philosophical point of view. Still, Mill\u2019s interest laid indeed primarily in the shaping of the mind, the beliefs, and the behavior of the \u201cknowing subject.\u201d His fundamental doctrine in psychology, his son reported, \u201cwas the formation of all human character by circumstances, through the universal Principle of Association, and the consequent unlimited possibility of improving the moral and intellectual condition of mankind by education\u201d (J.S. Mill 1873, 109, 111). For James Mill, education was all-powerful: \u201cif education does not perform every thing, there is hardly anything which it does not perform\u201d (Mill 1992, 160).\nMill\u2019s argument was straightforward: both individual and social wellbeing depends upon individual action. Actions depend upon one\u2019s feelings and thoughts (the last step in the chain of association prior to action). Education must thus be structured upon the \u201cknowledge of the sequences which take place in the human feelings or thought.\u201d Such knowledge enables the preceptor \u201cto make certain feelings or thoughts take place instead of others\u201d in the student. The kinds of mental succession, upon which education works, Mill urged, make \u201call the difference between the extreme of madness and of wickedness, and the greatest attainable heights of wisdom and virtue\u201d (Mill 1992, 147; Mill 1813a, 98). As one\u2019s bent of mind is revealed in the sequences of its ideas, the object of education is \u201cto provide for the constant production of certain sequences, rather than others,\u201d either through repetition and the inculcation of certain habits, or through association with ideas of pleasure or pain, including those of praise and blame (Mill 1992, 151).\nThe Essay on Education identified two sorts of circumstances that form character: physical and moral. Unlike moral circumstances, not all physical circumstances were amenable to human will. Still, Mill pointed out, the most important of them were: \u201call education is impotent\u201d unless nutrition and labor (and, consequently, health) are of appropriate quality and quantity. He pressed on the point that \u201cnature herself forbids that you shall make a wise and virtuous people, out of a starving\u201d or an over-worked people (Mill 1992, 172\u2013174). Especially as regards the latter, Mill painted a strikingly Platonic picture in 1813, discussing the influence of labor upon factory workers:\nShut up for almost the whole of that period of time which they pass without sleep, with their eyes and all their faculties exclusively fastened day after day upon one and the same narrow circle of objects and operations, their minds are accessible to a smaller number of ideas, and get less of any thing which can be called mental exercise, than any other set of human being, even than the savages in the forest (Mill 1813a, 94).\nThe \u201ceffects of their situation upon their minds are, if possible, still more deplorable\u201d than upon their body, he argued. \"[U]nless care is taken,\" he highlighted in Education, \"by means of the other instruments of education, to counteract\" these dreadful effects of economic progress, the minds \"of the great body of the people are in danger of really degenerating, while the other elements of civilization are advancing\" (Mill 1992, 173).\nAs far as the moral circumstances were concerned, rather than waste time debating final ends, Mill focused on accepted middle principles. The stable production of those mental sequences which fulfil the ends of education, he argued, depends upon cultivating four virtues: intelligence, temperance, justice and generosity. The first two promote individual well-being. Intelligence referred to \"bringing within our ken what is capable, and what is not capable of being used as means,\" but also \"seizing and combining, at the proper moment, whatever is the fittest as means to each particular end.\" More generally, rational practice requires a collection of observations of past acts, with a justified expectation (i.e. that similar causes produce similar effects) for specific results. Temperance entailed the ability of controlling one\u2019s appetites and desires, preventing them from leading to a \"hurtful direction,\" allowing the constant pursuit of what one \"deliberately approves.\" The latter two cardinal virtues, justice and generosity, promote social wellbeing, by avoiding doing harm and by doing positive good to others (i.e. acting supererogatorily) respectively. Of course, Mill insisted, that \"[i]n reality, as the happiness of the individual is bound up with that of his species, that which affects the happiness of the one, must also, in general, affect that of the other (Mill 1992, 154\u2013156, 179; Loizides 2019c).\n",
