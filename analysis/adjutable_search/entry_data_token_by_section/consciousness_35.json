    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Reflexive theories\n9.2 Reflexive theories\n \n\nReflexive theories, like higher-order theories, imply a strong link\nbetween consciousness and self-awareness.  They differ in that they\nlocate the aspect of self-awareness directly within the conscious\nstate itself rather than in a distinct meta-state directed at it. The\nidea that conscious states involve a double intentionality goes back\nat least to Brentano (1874) in the 19th century.  The conscious state\nis intentionally directed at an object outside itself\u2014such as a\ntree or chair in the case of a conscious perception\u2014as well as\nintentionally directed at itself. One and the same state is both an\nouter-directed awareness and an awareness of itself.  Several recent\ntheories have claimed that such reflexive awareness is a central\nfeature of conscious mental states.  Some view themselves as variants\nof higher-order theory (Gennaro 2004, 2012) while others reject the\nhigher-order category and describe their theories as presenting a\n\u201csame-order\u201d account of consciousness as self-awareness\n(Kriegel 2009). Yet others challenge the level distinction by\nanalyzing the meta-intentional content as implicit in the phenomenal\nfirst-order content of conscious states, as in so called Higher-Order\nGlobal State models (HOGS) (Van Gulick 2004,2006). A sample of papers,\nsome supporting and some attacking the reflexive view can be found in\nKrigel and Williford (2006).\n",
