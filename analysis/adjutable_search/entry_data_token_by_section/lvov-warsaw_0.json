    "main_text": "The Origin and Development of the Lvov-Warsaw School\n1. The Origin and Development of the Lvov-Warsaw School\n\nKazimierz Twardowski (1866\u20131938) began his post as professor of\nphilosophy at Lvov University in 1895. He came to Lvov from Vienna,\nwhere he had studied philosophy under Franz Brentano and Robert\nZimmermann. Twardowski belonged to the last group of Brentano\u2019s\nstudents. His Habilitationschrift (1894) concerned the\nconcepts of the content and the object of presentations; it \nclarified and sharpened this important distinction. This work strongly\ninfluenced Meinong and Husserl.\n\nTwardowski appeared in Lvov with the ambitious plan of creating a\nscientific philosophy (in Brentano\u2019s spirit) in Poland (at that\ntime, Poland was partitioned between Austro-Hungary, Germany and\nRussia; Lvov belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.) In fact, he\nsubordinated all his activities to achieving this task and\nconsiderably limited his own scientific work. Twardowski was an\nextraordinary and charismatic teacher. He very soon attracted many\nyoung people to philosophy. After ten years of teaching he sometimes\nhad about 200 candidates for seminars and 2000 attendants of his\nlectures. He propagated a clear style of writing and speaking about\nphilosophical matters, insisted upon justification of philosophical\ntheses and sharply distinguished philosophy as a science from\nworld-views. Following Brentano, he favoured problems on the\nborderline of descriptive psychology, grammar and logic (he\nsupplemented his object/content distinction by that of\nactions/products). A photo of Twardowski\u2019 seminar participants\ntaken during the 1925\u20131926 academic year is available (see the\n supplement),\n with most of the participants identified.\n\nAlthough Twardowski was not a logician and did not consider himself as\nsuch, his program formed a friendly environment for logic in all its\nsubdomains: formal logic, semantics and methodology of science. Jan\n\u0141ukasiewicz (1878\u20131956) was the first of Twardowski\u2019s\nstudents to be interested in logic. He began his lectures in logic in\nLvov in 1906. Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (1890\u20131963), Tadeusz\nCze\u017cowski (1889\u20131981), Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski\n(1886\u20131981) and Zygmunt Zawirski (1882\u20131948) studied\nmainly under Twardowski, but they also attended courses conducted by\n\u0141ukasiewicz. Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski (1886\u20131939)\njoined this circle in 1910. Warsaw appeared on the stage exactly in\n1915, when the University of Warsaw was reopened. The academic staff\nwas mainly imported from Lvov; \u0141ukasiewicz was appointed\nprofessor of philosophy.\n\nPoland recovered its independence in 1918 and Polish scholars began to\nbuild national academic life. The program for the development of\nmathematics elaborated by a mathematician Zygmunt Janiszewski (the\nJaniszewski program) had a great importance for the subsequent\ndevelopment of the LWS. According the Janiszewski program, Polish\nmathematicians should concentrate on set theory, topology and their\napplications to other branches of mathematics. In particular, the\nJaniszewski program attached great importance to mathematical logic\nand the foundations of mathematics. Two philosophers, namely\nLe\u015bniewski and \u0141ukasiewicz, became professors of the\nUniversity of Warsaw at the Faculty of Mathematical and Natural\nSciences. Both began intensive teaching of mathematical logic, mostly\namong mathematicians but also among philosophers. Thus, logic in the\nLWS had two parents: mathematics and philosophy.\n\nAlfred Tarski (1901\u20131983) opened the list of young\nmathematicians and philosophers attracted by logic in Warsaw. The\nlogical community in this city included (in alphabetical order and\ncovering the whole period 1918\u20131939: Stanis\u0142aw\nJa\u015bkowski (1906\u20131965), Adolf Lindenbaum (1904\u20131941?),\nAndrzej Mostowski (1913\u20131975), Moses Presburger (1904?\u20131943),\nJerzy S\u0142upecki (1904\u20131987), Boles\u0142aw Soboci\u0144ski\n(1904\u20131980; a philosopher by training)) and Mordechaj Wajsberg\n(1902\u20131942?). The names of three other logicians who graduated\nshortly before 1939 or studied during War World II and began their\nacademic work after 1945 should be added, namely Jan Kalicki\n(1922\u20131953; a mathematician), Czes\u0142aw Lejewski\n(1913\u20132001; a classicist and philosopher) and Henryk Hi\u017c\n(1917; a philosopher).\n\nThe development of logic in Warsaw had two subperiods in\n1918\u20131939, namely 1918\u20131929 and 1929\u20131939. The first\ndecade consisted in intensive teaching and scientific work at the\nseminars of Le\u015bniewski and \u0141ukasiewicz. Not many results\nwere published at that time. The explosion of publications took place\nin 1929 and later. There are several factors which caused the\ndevelopment of mathematical logic in Poland. The Warsaw school of\nlogic appears to be model case, but the power of this circle\ninfluenced other places where the general environment was not so\nfavourable to logic. The fruitful co-operation of mathematicians and\nphilosophers in Warszawa had the utmost significance. The founders of\nthe Polish mathematical school made a brave experiment consisting in\ninviting two philosophers with a modest mathematical background as\nprofessors at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences; this\ndid not happen in any other country. The gifts of Le\u015bniewski and\n\u0141ukasiewicz as teachers and the abilities of the latter as an\norganizer attracted young mathematicians. In Poland mathematical logic\nwas considered to be an autonomous science, not a part of mathematics\nor philosophy. From the present-day point of view this might seem as\nan exaggeration, but this ideology contributed essentially to the\nstrength of Polish logic. Their representatives were fairly conscious\nof the fact that the propagation and defence of the autonomy of this\nfield had to be confirmed by important scientific results and\ninternational recognition. Moreover, this view about logic motivated\nvarious purely theoretical investigations on formal systems. On the\nother hand, Polish logicians strongly insisted that logic should not\nbe restricted only to mathematics and required the co-operation of\nrepresentatives of all field in which logic might be used. Still\nanother factor played an important role, namely the conviction about\nthe social significance of logic as a weapon against all kinds of\nirrationalism. Tarski once said \u201cReligion [you can also say\n\u2018ideology\u2019 \u2014 JW] divides people, logic brings them\ntogether.\u201d According to \u0141ukasiewicz, \u201cLogic is\nmorality of thought and speech\u201d. Thus, Polish logicians doing\nlogic and teaching it were convinced that they were performing an\nimportant social service.\n\nKotarbi\u0144ski was appointed professor of philosophy in Warsaw in\n1919. His teaching activity resulted in a group of scholars working\nmainly in the philosophy of science, including Janina Hosiasson (later\nMrs. Lindenbaum; 1899\u20131942), Edward Pozna\u0144ski\n(1901\u20131976), Dina Sztejnbarg (later Mrs. Kotarbi\u0144ski)\n(1901\u20131997) and Aleksander Wundheiler (1902\u20131957).\n\nTwardowski and Ajdukiewicz (appointed professor in 1928) remained in\nLvov. They trained a group that included Izydora D\u0105mbska\n(1904\u20131983), Maria Kokoszy\u0144ska (1905\u20131981), Henryk\nMehlberg (1904\u20131978) and Zygmunt Schmierer (?\u20131943).\nAlthough Twardowski\u2019s students also taught at other Polish\nuniversities (Cze\u017cowski in Vilna, Zawirski in Pozna\u0144 and\nKrak\u00f3w), Lvov and Warsawa were the main centres of the LWS. The\nschool was also joined by a group of catholic philosophers, including\nFather Innocenty (J\u00f3zef) M. Boche\u0144ski (1902\u20131995)\nand Father Jan Salamucha (1904\u20131944).\n\nWorld War II had disastrous consequences for the LWS. Twardowski and\nLe\u015bniewski died before September 1, 1939. Of the people mentioned\nabove who lost their lives (mostly Jews murdered by the Nazis): the\nLindenbaums, Presburger, Salamucha, Schmierer and Wajsberg. Zawirski\ndied in 1947. Many emigrated from Poland during World War II or\nshortly after it: \u0141ukasiewicz (Dublin), Tarski (Berkeley),\nHi\u017c (Philadelphia), Kalicki (Berkeley), Lejewski (Manchester),\nMehlberg (Toronto, Chicago), Soboci\u0144ski (Notre Dame) and\nWundheiler (New York); Boche\u0144ski (Fribourge) and Pozna\u0144ski\n(Jerusalem, before 1939).\n\nThe situation in Poland in 1945\u20131948 was similar as before 1939.\nThe Marxist ideological offensive against bourgeois philosophy started\nin 1949. The policy became more liberal after 1956. Although many\nscholars of the LWS actively taught and worked in the new political\nreality, it would be difficult to say that the school continued its\nformer manner of existence. The tradition of the LWS was rather\npreserved in individual hands, but not as an organized enterprise.\n\nNote: the present essay focuses on the logical wing of the LWS. In\n1939, the entire school comprised about 80 scholars actively working\nin all branches of philosophy as well as in other academic fields,\nlike psychology, sociology, theoretical linguistics, history of art\nand literary studies.\n",
