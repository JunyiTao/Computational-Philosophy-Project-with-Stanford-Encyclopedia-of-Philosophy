    "main_text": "Characteristic Human Properties || Privileging Properties\n3.1 Privileging Properties\n\nThe answer given by TP2 to the first question was in terms of the\nfully developed human form, where \u201cform\u201d does not refer\nsolely to observable physical or behavioural characteristics, but also\nincludes psychological features. This answer entails two claims:\nfirst, that there is one single such \u201cform\u201d, i.e.,\nproperty or set of properties, that figures in explanations that range\nacross individual human organisms. It also entails that there is a\npoint in human development that counts as \u201cfull\u201d, that is,\nas development\u2019s goal or \u201ctelos\u201d. These claims go\nhand in hand with the assumption that there is a distinction to be\ndrawn between normal and abnormal adult specimens of the species.\nThere is, common sense tells us, a sense in which normal adult humans\nhave two legs, two eyes, one heart and two kidneys at specific\nlocations in the body; they also have various dispositions, for\ninstance, to feel pain and to feel emotions, and a set of capacities,\nsuch as for perception and for reasoning. And these, so it seems, may\nbe missing, or under- or overdeveloped in abnormal specimens.\n\nSober has influentially described accounts that work with such\nteleological assumptions as adhering to an Aristotelian \u201cNatural\nState Model\u201d (Sober 1980: 353ff.). Such accounts work with a\ndistinction that has no place in evolutionary biology, according to\nwhich variation of properties across populations is the key to\nevolution. Hence, no particular end states of organisms are privileged\nas \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d (Hull 1986: 7ff.). So\nany account that privileges particular morphological, behavioural or\npsychological human features has to provide good reasons that are both\nnon-evolutionary and yet compatible with the evolutionary account of\nspecies. Because of the way that the notion of the normal is\nfrequently employed to exclude and oppress, those reasons should be\nparticularly good (Silvers 1998; Dupr\u00e9 2003: 119ff.; Richter\n2011: 43ff.; Kronfeldner 2018: 15ff.).\n\nThe kinds of reasons that may be advanced could either be internal to,\nor independent of the biological sciences. If the former, then various\ntheoretical options may seem viable. The first grounds in the\nclaim that, although species are not natural kinds and are thus\nunsuited to figuring in laws of nature (Hull 1987: 171), they do\nsupport descriptions with a significant degree of generality, some of\nwhich may be important (Hull 1984: 19). A theory of human nature\ndeveloped on this basis should explain the kind of importance on the\nbasis of which particular properties are emphasised. The\nsecond theoretical option is pluralism about the metaphysics\nof species: in spite of the fairly broad consensus that species are\ndefined as units of evolution, the pluralist can deny the primacy of\nevolutionary dynamics, arguing that other epistemic aims allow the\necologist, the systematist or the ethologist to work with an equally\nlegitimate concept of species that is not, or not exclusively\ngenealogical (cf. Hull 1984: 36; Kitcher 1986: 320ff.; Hull 1987:\n178\u201381; Dupr\u00e9 1993: 43f.). The third option\ninvolves a relaxation of the concept of natural kinds, such that it no\nlonger entails the instantiation of intrinsic, necessary, sufficient\nand spatiotemporally unrestricted properties, but is nevertheless able\nto support causal explanations. Such accounts aim to reunite taxonomic\nand explanatory criteria, thus allowing species taxa to count as\nnatural kinds after all (Boyd 1999a; R. Wilson, Barker, & Brigandt\n2007: 196ff.). Where, finally, the reasons advanced for\nprivileging certain properties are independent of biology, these tend\nto concern features of\nhumans\u2019\u2014\u201cour\u201d\u2014self-understanding as\nparticipants in, rather than observers of, a particular form of life.\nThese are likely to be connected to normative considerations. Here\nagain, it seems that a special explanation will be required for why\nthese privileged properties should be grouped under the rubric\n\u201chuman nature\u201d.\n\nThe accounts to be described in the next\n subsection (3.2)\n of this entry are examples of the first strategy.\n Section 4\n includes discussion of the relaxed natural kinds strategy.\n Section 5\n focuses on accounts of human nature developed from a participant\nperspective and also notes the support that the pluralist metaphysical\nstrategy might be taken to provide.\n",
