    "main_text": "Theory and Theoretical Virtues || The Tasks of Moral Theory\n2.1 The Tasks of Moral Theory\n\nOne task (though this is somewhat controversial) of a moral theory\nis to give an account of right actions. Often, this will involve\nan explication of what counts as good \u2013 some theories then get\nspelled out in terms of how they approach the good, by maximizing it,\nproducing enough of it, honoring it, etc. In addition, some\ntheories explicate the right in terms of acting in accordance with\none\u2019s duties, or acting as a virtuous person would act. In\nthese cases the notions of \u2018duty\u2019 and \u2018virtue\u2019\nbecome important to the overall analysis, and one function of moral\ntheory is to explore the systematic connections between duty or virtue\nand the right and the good.\n\nMoral theories also have both substantive and formal aims. \nMoral theories try to provide criteria for judging actions. It\nmight be that the criterion is simple, such as right actions maximize\nthe good, or it may be complex, such as the right action is the one\nthat gives adequate weight to each competing duty. \nSometimes, in recognition that there is not always \u201cthe\u201d\nright action, the theory simply provides an account of wrongness, or\npermissibility and impermissibility, which allows that a range of\nactions might count as \u201cright\u201d. \n\nIn addition to simply providing criteria for right or virtuous\naction, or for being a virtuous person, a given moral theory, for\nexample, will attempt to explain why something, like an action\nor character trait, has a particular moral quality, such as rightness\nor virtuousness. Some theories view rightness as grounded in or\nexplained by value. Some view rightness as a matter of\nreasons that are prior to value. In each case, to\nprovide an explanation of the property of \u2018rightness\u2019 or\n\u2018virtuousness\u2019 will be to provide an account of what the\ngrounding value is, or an account of reasons for action.\n\nIn addition, moral theories may also provide\ndecision-procedures to employ in determining how to act\nrightly or virtuously, conditions on being good or virtuous, or\nconditions on morally appropriate practical deliberation. Thus,\nthe theory provides substance to evaluation and reasons. However,\nmoral theories, in virtue of providing an explanatory framework, help\nus see connections between criteria and decision-procedures, as well as\nprovide other forms of systemization. Thus, moral theories will\nbe themselves evaluated according to their theoretical virtues:\nsimplicity, explanatory power, elegance, etc. To evaluate moral\ntheories as theories, each needs to be evaluated in terms of\nhow well it succeeds in achieving these theoretical goals.\n\nThere are many more specialized elements to moral theories as\nwell. For example, a moral theory often concerns itself with\nfeatures of moral psychology relevant to action and character, such as\nmotives, intentions, emotions, and reasons responsiveness. A\nmoral theory that incorporates consideration of consequences into the\ndetermination of moral quality, will also be concerned with issues\nsurrounding the proper aggregation of those consequences, and\nthe scope of the consequences to be considered.\n",
