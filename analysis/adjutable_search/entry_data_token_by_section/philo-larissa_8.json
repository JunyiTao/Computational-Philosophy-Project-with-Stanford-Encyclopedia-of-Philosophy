    "main_text": "Ethics and Rhetoric\n6. Conclusion\n\nOn this reconstruction of his work, Philo eventually abandoned both\nradical and mitigated skepticism for a form of fallibilism that he\ndescribed as the basis of the Academic tradition. His promotion of\nAcademic philosophy as open-ended critical inquiry had some impact on\nthe work of Cicero, Plutarch, Favorinus and Augustine, but his radical\ninnovations in epistemology and ethics sank almost without trace. The\nskeptical tradition survived in the form of Pyrrhonism, but the\nAcademy did not. Like any interpretation of Philo\u2019s\nphilosophical development, this reconstruction is speculative in some\nrespects. But much of it can be confirmed or disconfirmed by further\nwork on ancient skepticism, and especially its Latin tradition, which\nremains an open field for research.\n",
