What would it mean to give children the\nequal opportunity for flourishing lives? Again, that depends on the\nview one should have about the appropriate obstacles. At the most\nextreme, some have argued all people should face only the obstacle of\ntheir own choices. The view makes sense of many of our intuitions. For\nexample, we tend to think that victims of bad luck, those born with\ndisabilities, or those who are severely harmed by natural disasters,\nare entitled to aid. Meanwhile, those who gamble and lose are not\nusually viewed as having any case for compensation.\n\nThe view so stated has very radical implications for educational\ninstitutions since it charges them with ensuring that all\nstudents have equal prospects for living well, regardless of\ndifferences in their natural potentials. Thus, educational\ninstitutions organized in accordance with equality of opportunity for\nflourishing would not only have to provide compensatory support and\nresources for those from disadvantaged family backgrounds, but also\nfor those who have genetic disadvantages.\n\nMany philosophers have taken issue with this general view. Some have\nargued that its unmitigated emphasis on choice and responsibility\nwould lead to stigma (e.g., Anderson 1999; Wolff 1998). Imagine a\nletter to parents saying that the state is offering your child extra\nopportunities because your genes create significant disadvantages.\nMoreover, as has already been noted, any view emphasizing choice so\nheavily seems especially out of place when dealing with young\nchildren.\n\nWe also need an account of the flourishing that should be the aim of\neducational opportunities. Is it to be understood in terms of\npreference satisfaction? Or something else? Would it require autonomy?\nIn choosing an account of flourishing, we have to respond to these\nquestions and also be attentive to concerns about sectarianism. How\ncan an undoubtedly controversial account of what makes a human life\nvaluable (e.g., that a good life is an autonomous life) be a suitable\nbasis for educational policy in a pluralistic society? Many liberals\nargue that families may justifiably reject, and request exemption\nfrom, an education that conflicts with their religious, cultural, or\npolitical views. They argue that an educational system driven by a\nprinciple of equality of opportunity for flourishing will not respect\nindividuals\u2019 entitlement to pursue their own account of how they\nwish to live, in accordance with their own reason (Rawls 2005). Of\ncourse, it might be pointed out in reply, that educational decisions\nmade by parents affect not only their own views of how to live but\nalso, and more importantly, their children\u2019s.\n",
