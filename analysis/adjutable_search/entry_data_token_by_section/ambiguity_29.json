It is tempting to\ntreat these as ambiguities involving the modal term. However, it is\nworth noting that other treatments abound. Kratzer (1983) treats\nmodals as univocal but indexical: they get their differing\ninterpretations by taking in different input sets of worlds and\norderings induced on the relevant sets. If this is right, it may well\nbe that what looks like an ambiguity should actually be treated as a\nmatter of straightforward indexicality (much like \u2018I\u2019 is\nnot ambiguous but indexical).\n6.4 Focal Stress\nA really interesting case that may be loosely described as\nambiguity at the level of a sentence concerns focal stress and its\nmyriad of interesting effects. Generally focal stress is well known to\nco-ordinate assertions with questions under discuss and to introduce\nsets of alternatives into a discourse. In particular, these\nalternative sets can have truth conditional effects, for example:\n\nPutin only poisons his opponents.\nPutin only poisons his opponents\n (78) is falsified by Putin shooting an opponent, (79) is not.\n(78) introduces a presupposition that Putin does something to his\nopponents while (79) introduces a presupposition that Putin poisons\nsomeone. The sentence, thought of in terms of orthography, \u2018Putin only\npoisons his opponents\u2019 is thus ambiguous. Assuming that focal stress\nis syntactically marked, the LF disambiguates. See (Rooth (1993) and\nHerburger (2000) for semantic theories of focal stress).\n\n6.5 Cancellation vs. Disambiguation\n\nGriceans have long used cancellation as a method to detect\nconversational implicatures, or information communicated by an utterer\nof a sentence that isn\u2019t part of what\u2019s said by S. Cancellation is a\nprocedure by which an explicit denial of putatively conveyed\ninformation is conjoined to the original utterance to see if the\nresult is a contradiction. For example, consider an utterance of:\n\nI got drunk and I drove home (but not in that order).\n\n\n\nThe non-bracketed sentence, absent an utterance of the bracketed\ncontent, will typically convey the order events as being mirrored in\nthe order of the conjuncts. But, as Grice famously argued, this\nisn\u2019t due to an embedded ordering in the meaning of\n\u2018and\u2019 as shown by the addition of the bracketed content\nnot producing a contradiction. The Gricean stories about how we come\nabout this extra information in non-cancellation cases is fairly well\nknown. But given the preceding, it\u2019s not hard to see that an\noption has been overlooked: why shouldn\u2019t we think of\n\u2018but\u2019 as playing the role of a disambiguator? If\n\u2018and\u2019 were ambiguous, for example, wouldn\u2019t one way\nof avoiding an contradictory utterance involve adding a phrase that\nruled out one possible meaning? We saw Grice\u2019s claims about\nModified Occam\u2019s razor and so perhaps attributing an ambiguity\nto \u2018and\u2019 is not so attractive.  But perhaps an ambiguity\nin the assignment of times to the present tense markers is, and the\nputative cancellation serves to indicate the intended resolution of the\nthose variables? Or perhaps \u2018and\u2019 signals two or more\npossible discourse relations and the putative cancellation services to\ndisambiguate between those? Lepore and Stone (2016) put disambiguation\nto work in an attempt to show that ambiguities in interpretation are\nmore rife and wide spread than we might have previously assumed. If\nthey are right, ambiguity plays a more central role than perhaps might\nhave been thought in sentence, utterance and discourse\ninterpretation. It remains to see if they are. The point of these\nexamples is that it is often difficult to tell which theoretical\ntreatment best explains a case of multiple interpretability. One must\nbe cautious in one\u2019s approach to these issues. It is all too\neasy to notice an apparent ambiguity, but often all too difficult to\nexplain its nature.\n",
