    "main_text": "Female Dependency and Didactic Texts for Women || Gender-based Consciousness\n4.3 Gender-based Consciousness\n\nThe emergence of gender-based consciousness is the natural fallout\nfrom this uniquely women-centric literary genre made for women, of\nwomen, and by women. Ban Zhao\u2019s N\u00fcjie as the\ninaugurating text for this literary genre and the kind of life that\nBan Zhao lived became inspirational models for other equally talented\nand virtuous women. Song Ruoxin and Song Ruozhao who self-consciously\ninvoked Ban Zhao as their interlocutor in their original draft of the\nN\u00fclunyu\u2014intended as a parity to the Confucian\ncanonic text of Lunyu\u2014are clear examples of this sort.\nInstead of looking to Confucius as their intellectual guide, the two\nSong sisters took Xuan Wenjun (c. 4th century CE)\u2014a\nlearned woman held the position of instructor in the state academy\nteaching over one hundred students\u2014as Confucius, and took Ban\nZhao as their Yen Hui (i.e., Confucius\u2019s favorite disciple) in\ntheir imagined dialogical instructions to provide domestic counsels to\nwomen (Jiutangshu, Ch. 56, paragraph 33), seemingly invoking\na women-centric intellectual genealogy.\n\nEmpress Renxiaowen composed Neixun with a view to supplant\nBan Zhao\u2019s seven brief chapters of N\u00fcjie in order\nto offer a comprehensive text for women\u2019s education; this is\nanother example of women\u2019s affirmation of their own intellectual\nauthority over the domain of nei. Furthermore, Empress\nRenxiaowen equated her own effort in writing the Neixun as a\nstandard text for women\u2019s education with the famed Confucian\nscholar\u2019s (i.e., Zhu Xi; 1130\u20131200 CE) compilation of the\nElementary Learning (Xiaoxue) as a standard text for\nmen (Neixun, Preface), making women\u2019s education\ncomparable to men\u2019s.\n\nThe self-assertiveness of a women-centric genealogy and women\u2019s\nown intellectual authority is most clearly illustrated in the\nN\u00fcfan jielu, the last text of the N\u00fcsishu.\nUnlike Ban Zhao\u2019s N\u00fcjie, Woman Liu\u2019s\nN\u00fcfan jielu was not overly concerned with household\nmanagement nor immersed in excessive humble rhetoric of lowliness.\nInstead, Woman Liu appealed to past virtuous and talented women from\nempresses, female generals, concubines, to servants as historical\nprecedents to illustrate the importance of nei and\nfurthermore to advocate for the priority of nei over\nwai, women over men, daughters over sons (N\u00fcfan\njielu, Ch. 1, Ch. 3, Ch. 9, and Ch. 11). Woman Liu\u2019s\naudacious claim of female priority is part of this subversive effect\nof the didactic texts for women, which paradoxically are meant to\npropagate female servitude and compliance to patrilineage.\n",
