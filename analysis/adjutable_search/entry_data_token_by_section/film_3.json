    "main_text": "Emotional Engagement\n4. Emotional Engagement\n\n\nPhilosophic discussion of viewer involvement with films starts out\nwith a puzzle that has been raised about many artforms: Why should we\ncare what happens to fictional characters?  After all, since they are\nfictional, their fates shouldn't matter to us in the way that the\nfates of real people do. But, of course, we do get involved in the\ndestinies of these imaginary beings. The question is why.  Because so\nmany films that attract our interest are fictional, this question is\nan important one for philosophers of film to answer. \n\n\nOne answer, common in the film theory tradition, is that the reason\nthat we care about what happens to some fictional characters is\nbecause we identify with them. Although or, perhaps, because\nthese characters are highly idealized\u2014they are more beautiful,\nbrave, resourceful, etc. than any actual human being could\nbe\u2014viewers identify with them, thereby also taking themselves to\nbe correlates of these ideal beings. But once we see the characters as\nversions of ourselves, their fates matter to us, for we see ourselves\nas wrapped up in their stories. In the hands of feminist theorists,\nthis idea was used to explain how films use their viewers' pleasures\nto support a sexist society. Male viewers of film, it was held,\nidentify with their idealized screen counterparts and enjoy the\nobjectification of women through both screen images that they view\nwith pleasure and also narratives in which the male characters with\nwhom they identify come to possess the sought after female\ncharacter.\n\n\nPhilosophers of film have argued that identification is too crude a\ntool to use to explain our emotional engagement with characters, for\nthere is a wide variety of attitudes that we take to the fictional\ncharacters we see projected on the screen. (See, for example, Smith\n(1995).) And even if we did identify with some characters, this would\nnot explain why we had any emotional reactions to characters with whom\nwe did not identify.  Clearly, a more general account of viewer\ninvolvement with cinematic characters and the films in which they\nappear is required.\n\n\nThe general outline of the answer philosophers of film have provided\nto the question of our emotional involvement with films is that we\ncare about what happens in films because films get us to imagine\nthings taking place, things that we do care about. Because how we\nimagine things working out does affect our emotions, fiction films\nhave an emotional impact upon us.\n\n\nThere are two basic accounts that philosophers have put forward to\nexplain the effects that the imagination has upon us.  Simulation\ntheory employs a computer analogy, saying that imagining\nsomething involves one having one's usual emotional response to\nsituations and people, only the emotions are running\noff-line. What this means is that, when I have an emotional\nresponse like anger to an imagined situation, I feel the same emotion\nthat I would normally feel only I am not inclined to act on this\nemotion, say, by yelling or responding in an angry way, as I would be\nif the emotion was a full-fledged emotion. \n\n\nWhat this explains, then, is a seemingly paradoxical feature of our\nfilm-going experience: that we seem to enjoy watching things on the\nscreen that we would hate seeing in real life. The most obvious\ncontext for this is horror films, for we may enjoy seeing horrific\nevents and beings that we would strongly desire not to witness in real\nlife. The last thing I would want to see more of in real life is a\nrampaging giant ape, yet I am fascinated to watch its screen\nexpoits. The simulation theorist says that the reason for this is\nthat, when we experience an emotion off-line that would be distressing\nin real life, we may actually enjoy having that emotion in the safety\nof the off-line situation.\n\n\nOne problem facing the simulation theorist is explaining what it means\nfor an emotion to be off-line. While this is an intriguing metaphor,\nit is not clear that the simulation theorist can provide an adequate\naccount of how we are to cash it out.\n\n\nAn alternative account of our emotional response to imagined scenarios\nhas been dubbed the thought theory. The idea here is that we\ncan have emotional responses to mere thoughts.  When I am told that a\njunior colleague of mine was unjustly denied reappointment, the\nthought of this injustice is sufficient to make me experience\nanger. Similarly, when I imagine such a scenario in relation to\nsomeone, the mere thought of them being treated in this way can\noccasion my anger. Mere thought can bring about real emotion.\n\n\nWhat the thought theory claims about our emotional response to films\nis that our emotions are brought about by the thoughts that occur to\nus as we are watching a film. When we see the dastardly villain tying\nthe innocent heroine to the tracks, we are both concerned and outraged\nby the very thought that he is acting in this way and that she is\ntherefore in danger. Yet all the time we are aware that this is a\nmerely fictional situation, so there is no temptation to yield to a\ndesire to save her. We are always aware that no one is really in\ndanger. As a result, there is no need, says the thought theorist, for\nthe complexities of simulation theory in order to explain why we are\nmoved by the movies.\n\n\nThere are some problems with thought theory as well. Why should a mere\nthought, as opposed to a belief, be something that occasions an\nemotional response from us?  If I believe that you were wronged,\nthat's one thing. But the thought of your being wronged is\nanother. Since we can't have full-fledged beliefs about the fictional\ncharacters in films, the thought theory needs to explain why we are so\nmoved by their fates. (See Plantinga and Smith (1999) for more\ndiscussion of this issue.)\n",
