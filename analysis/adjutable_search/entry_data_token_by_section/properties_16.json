Complex Properties\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between simple and\ncomplex properties, even though some philosophers take all\nproperties to be simple (Grossmann 1983: \u00a7\u00a758\u201361). The\nformer are not characterizable in terms of other properties, are\nprimitive and unanalyzable and thus have no internal structure,\nwhereas the latter somehow have a structure, wherein other properties,\nor more generally entities, are parts or constituents. It is not\nobvious that there are simple properties, since one may imagine that\nall properties are analyzable into constituents ad infinitum\n(Armstrong 1978b: 67). Even setting this aside, to provide examples is\nnot easy. Traditionally, determinate colors are cited, but nowadays\nmany would rather appeal to fundamental physical properties such as\nhaving a certain electric charge. It is easier to provide\nputative examples of complex properties, once some other properties\nare taken for granted, e.g., blue and spherical or blue\nor non-spherical. These logically compound properties,\nwhich involve logical operations, will be considered in\n \u00a74.1.\n Next, in\n \u00a74.2\n we shall discuss other kinds of complex properties, called\nstructural (after Armstrong 1978b), which are eliciting a\ngrowing interest, as a recent survey testifies (Fisher 2018). Their\ncomplexity has to do with the subdivisions of their instances into\nsubcomponents. Typical examples come from chemistry, e.g.,\nH2O and methane understood as properties\nof molecules.\n\nIt should be noted that it is not generally taken for granted that\ncomplex properties literally have parts or constituents. Some\nphilosophers take this line (Armstrong 1978a: 36\u201339, 67ff.;\nBigelow & Pargetter 1989; Orilia 1999), whereas others demur, and\nrather think that talk in terms of structures with constituents is\nmetaphorical and dependent on our reliance on structured terms such as\n\u201cblue and spherical\u201d (Bealer 1982; Cocchiarella 1986a;\nSwoyer 1998: \u00a71.2).\n",
