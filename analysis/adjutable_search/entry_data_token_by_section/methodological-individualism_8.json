    "main_text": "Criticism || Microrealization-robustness\n6.3 Microrealization-robustness\n\n\nChristian List and Kai Spiekermann (2013) have recently argued that\n\u201ccausal-explanatory holism\u201d is called for in the social\nsciences under a very precise set of circumstances. Their general\nthought is that descriptions can usually be formulated at different\nlevels of generality, and that in certain circumstances it may be more\nilluminating to formulate explanations using concepts at a higher, rather\nthan a lower, level of generality. This is particularly so when a\nhigher-level property can be instantiated in various ways, but some\ncausal relation in which it is embedded continues to obtain regardless\nof the particular instantiation (a condition that they refer to as\n\u201cmicrorealization-robustness\u201d). This suggests that\nmethodological individualism will not be appropriate in cases where\n\u201csocial regularities are robust to changes in their\nindividual-level realization\u201d (629). Under such conditions,\n\u201cexplanatory holism\u201d is required. List and Spiekermann\nspecify three \u201cjointly necessary and sufficient\nconditions\u201d (639) under which this will be so:\n\nMultiple levels of description: The system admits\nlower and higher levels of description, associated with different\nlevel-specific properties (e.g. individual-level properties versus\naggregate properties).\n\nMultiple realizability of higher-level properties: The system\u2019s\nhigher-level properties are determined by its lower-level properties,\nbut can be realized by numerous different configurations of them and\nhence cannot feasibly be redescribed in terms of lower-level\nproperties.\n\nMicrorealization-robust causal relations: The causal relations\nin which some of the system\u2019s higher-level properties stand are robust\nto changes in their lower-level realization.\n \n\nAn example they give is the \u201cdemocratic peace hypothesis\u201d (2013, 640),\nthat democracies do not go to war with one another. This is typically\nexplained in terms of internal structural features of democracies that\nprivilege norms of cooperation and compromise. There are, however, so\nmany ways of instantiating these features that an explanation at the\nlower level of description, such as that of the individual, would be\nunable to articulate the relevant causal relation.\n",
