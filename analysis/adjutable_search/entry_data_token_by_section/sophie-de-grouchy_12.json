    "main_text": "Philosophy || Political Philosophy\n4.2 Political Philosophy\n4.2.1 Liberty\n\nSince the revival of neo-republican thought in contemporary political\nphilosophy, several philosophers of the past have been re-interpreted\nas republican thinkers. This is the case, for instance, with Mary\nWollstonecraft, who until recently was thought of as a liberal\nthinker, is now seen by many as an important source for feminist\nrepublicanism (Halldenius 2015; Berges & Coffee 2016). Although we\nshould be weary of reading too much contemporary political theory into\npast thinkers, in particular when it comes to very technical arguments\nand definitions, it is nonetheless often helpful to focus on the\ncentral themes of republican thought in order to understand these\nthinkers. In particular, the Revolutionary engagement with liberty was\nvery often framed in Roman terms with arguments that to become a\nrepublic was to become free from domination by an arbitrary power.\nThese thoughts resonated particularly strongly, and sometimes\ndifferently for women philosophers as they considered whether their\npositions as wives and daughters in a patriarchal society meant that\nthey too were dominated, and would carry on being so in a republic\nunless marriage and family laws were reformed. This was the focus of\nMary Wollstonecraft and Olympe de Gouges, but it was less so in the\ncase of Grouchy, who to some extent relied on her husband\u2019s more\npowerful and influential voice to propose feminist reforms.\n\nPlacing Grouchy in a republican context highlights the importance of\nher work for the French Revolution and vice versa. Few political\nphilosophers write in a vacuum; most are influenced by or wish to\ninfluence the events unfolding around them. But when the events are as\nremarkable as a revolution, then it makes no sense to ignore their\nimpact on the work we are looking at. In the case of Grouchy, it is\neven clearer that she wished to participate, through her writings, in\nthe making of the new Republic; in the summer of 1791, together with\nCondorcet and a few friends, she established a political journal,\nLe R\u00e9publicain, the purpose of which was to enlighten\nthe public as to what republicanism was.\n\nLe R\u00e9publicain lasted for just over a month, framed by\ntwo events: Louis XVI\u2019s attempted escape from France, and the\nChamp de Mars Massacre. The aim of Le R\u00e9publicain\nstated in its opening article, \u201cAvis aux Fran\u00e7ais,\u201d\nwas to promote the ideal of republicanism, attempting to make it more\nrespectable and better understood than it was at the time: \u201cto\nenlighten minds on the subject of republicanism, which is slandered\nbecause it is misunderstood\u201d. (Condorcet and Paine 1792, p.5\n\nA theme that is strongly present in all the articles of Le\nR\u00e9publicain, including the ones attributed to Grouchy, is\nthe threat to freedom constituted by any monarchy, no matter how\nwell-intentioned the monarch is. In this, Grouchy and the other\nauthors of the R\u00e9publicain differ from republicans\ninspired by Montesquieu, such as Siey\u00e8s, who believed that the\nform of government was incidental to a republican constitution as long\nas the ruler always acted in the public interest. Grouchy and others\ndisagreed on the grounds that the hereditary power granted to a\nmonarch is always arbitrary, so that even if it is benign, it is not\nreliably so. It does not matter, says Paine, whether a monarch is\n\u201ca fool a hypocrite or a tyrant\u201d\u2014what matters is\nthat this individual has \u201cabsolute power\u201d over everyone,\nincluding those who are not yet born (Condorcet and Paine 1792, p.5. A\nmonarch who is well intentioned may change his attitude for personal\nreasons and become a tyrant, or he may die and leave the power in the\nhands of a tyrannical successor.\n4.2.2 Equality\n\nPhilosophers of the French revolution were interested in equality as\nwell as liberty (fraternity was added later to the motto), but the\nequality that concerned them was equality of status, specifically\ncivic status, rather than political status. Very few of them even\nthought about economic equality. Sophie de Grouchy wrote that all\ncitizens are owed the same respect, and this implies that there should\nnot be extreme economic inequality.\n\nThe central argument of Grouchy\u2019s Letters is that\nvirtue, moral or political, is born out of sympathy, the ability and\npropensity to feel others\u2019 pain and to want to relieve it.\nGrouchy claims that we first experience sympathy as an infant in the\narms of a nurse, and that we learn progressively to feel sympathy for\nthe physical and mental pain that any other person experiences,\nwhether or not we are close to them. But in order for this to be\npossible, we do need to see the suffering other as a human being, as\nsomeone just as capable of experiencing pain as we are. Extreme\ninequality means that this does not happen: the very rich and the very\npoor do not regard each other as being part of the same species, so\nthat they cannot sympathize with each other and will not apply the\nlaws of morality and justice in their dealings with each other (Letter\nVIII).\n\nGrouchy\u2019s concrete proposal to reduce extreme inequality does\nnot include even the possibility of future inequality. She assumes\nthat without legally supported inequality, natural inequalities (in\nintelligence and fecundity) would result in three quarters of the land\nbeing distributed randomly according to luck and skill and one quarter\ndistributed equally between families. But this, she argues, with\nfigures at hand, would still exclude extreme poverty or extreme wealth\nand would be sufficient to ensure that all citizens recognized each\nother as equally worthy of respect.\n\nAlthough there is definitely a feminist background to Grouchy\u2019s\nLetters, one which reflects her husband\u2019s 1790 paper on\nthe inclusion of women to the rights of the city, and perhaps in fact\ninspired that paper, it does not have a clear or central feminist\nagenda. Humanity in general is the focus of her discussion; women are\nexplicitly included in the arguments (indeed, the very first teacher\nof sympathy is the wet-nurse, the most prominent example given of a\ngood teacher is Sophie\u2019s own mother, and mothers and fathers are\nequally enjoined to participate in a child\u2019s proper education)\nbut they are not given separate consideration. In her discussion of\nfamily law, she does mention reforms that would affect women more\nparticularly.\n4.3 Legal Philosophy\n4.3.1 Citizenship\n\nIn her defense of equality, Sophie de Grouchy considers the problems\nbrought about by inequality of status, privileges, and wealth and the\nway in which the law contributes to these problems by maintaining\nprivileges. She is in agreement with the principles debated in the\nearly days of the French revolution, in particular by Emmanuel\nSiey\u00e8s who argued that to be unequal in the eyes of the law is\nto be potentially dominated. That is, a citizen can use a privileged\nrelationship to the law to abuse another. Grouchy argues that this was\none the greatest wrongs of the Ancient R\u00e9gime, i.e., when the\nlaw is not applied equally to all, those who cannot manipulate it\nperceive themselves as dominated:\n\n\n[When the law allows for] privileges, hereditary, personal or local\nwhich offer a legal loophole, direct or indirect, [t]hen the people\nare tempted to see criminal laws as made against them and in favor of\nthe rich, as the result of an association designed to oppress them.\n(Letter VIII, p. 152\n\n4.3.2 Punishment\n\nMuch of Grouchy\u2019s discussion of the law focuses of the question\nof punishment. Before 1789, there were a number of ways in which the\nlaw could kill its criminals depending both on the kind of crime they\nhad committed and their station. Aristocrats were decapitated with a\nsword. This was regarded as the most honorable death, although it was\nnot always the least painful or horrible. The Count Lally-Tollendal,\nwho received the death penalty in 1766 for having betrayed the\nKing\u2019s interest at war, had to be hit three times by the sword\nbefore his neck could be broken and the head detached. Sanson, the\nexecutor of the Revolution, cited his example when defending the\nproposed new machine that would cut heads off neatly and instantly.\nNonetheless, decapitation was more honorable than the sentences\nreserved for commoners of death by hanging (murderers) or the wheel\n(thieves, highway robbers). The crime women were most commonly accused\nof was infanticide or performing abortions. These were punished by\nhanging when they were found guilty of having killed their infants,\nbut, as was most often the case, when evidence was lacking, they would\ndo prison time for fornication, or be freed until more evidence could\nbe found.\n\nGrouchy\u2019s discussion of punishment is clearly influenced by the\nwritings of the Milanese criminologist Cesare Beccaria. Beccaria had\nalready argued for the necessity of equal penalties for all as even\nprivileges must rest on an equal respect for the law. His book On\nCrimes and Punishment published in 1764 was translated in French\nthat same year and published with a lengthy commentary from Voltaire.\nBeccaria came to Paris and spent much of 1776 in Madame\nHelvetius\u2019s salon in Auteuil. His influence was no doubt still\npresent some years later when the Marquis de Condorcet, and their\nfuture brother-in-law Pierre-George Cabanis, and later\nCondorcet\u2019s wife Sophie de Grouchy also became frequent\nvisitors. This, as well as Condorcet\u2019s close connection with\nVoltaire, and his own engagement at the time Beccaria\u2019s book was\npublished in penal reform, goes some way towards explaining\nGrouchy\u2019s affinities with Beccaria\u2019s claims. In her\nLetters on Sympathy, she argues that:\n\n\nIn order for the fear of a sentence to be effective and beneficial the\nsentence must not outrage. Its justice must be perceptible to average\nreason, and it must especially awaken the conscience, at the same time\nas it punishes its silence and slumber. But this will not be so\n[\u2026] if a judge can arbitrarily harden or soften a sentence; if\nthere are privileges, hereditary, personal or local which offer a\nlegal loophole, direct or indirect. (Letter VIII)\n\n4.3.3 Marriage and family laws\n\nDivorce was legalized and made more accessible for a brief period\nduring the French Revolution before it was codified under Napoleon in\na way that made much more difficult to obtain, especially for women.\nGrouchy in her Letters argues in favor not only of divorce,\nbut of short-term, renewable marriage contracts and clear rights for\nchildren born outside marriage and for their mothers. In these she is\nin agreement with another woman philosopher of the Revolution, Olympe\nde Gouges. Grouchy derived these arguments at least in part from\nMontesquieu\u2019s analysis of the Roman law in the Spirit of the\nLaw.\n4.3.4 Commercial law\n\nGrouchy also argued that a heavily regulated market increased poverty,\nforcing the poor to remain poor, or even become poorer because they\ncouldn\u2019t regulate their exchanges or negotiate their work and\nproduction fairly. Grouchy, like Condorcet and Turgot, believed that\nshackling the market with strict laws was a form of domination and\nthat allowing farmers and merchants to set their own prices would go\nsome way towards relieving poverty in the country. Thus she can be\ninterpreted as one of the original defenders of commercial\nrepublicanism (Berg\u00e8s 2018a).",
