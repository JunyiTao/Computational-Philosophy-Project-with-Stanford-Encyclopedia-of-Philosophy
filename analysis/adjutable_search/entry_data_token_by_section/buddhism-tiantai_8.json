    "main_text": "Transformative Self-Recontextualization (\u958b\u6b0a\u986f\u5be6 kaiquanxianshi) || Time and Facts\n3.3 Time and Facts\n\nThe Three Truths, then, are actually three different but mutually\nimplicative ways of looking at any object or state. Each implies the\nother two, and each is one way to describe the whole of that\nobject, including its other two aspects. To be established is to be\nnegated. To be begun is to be constitutively incomplete; to be\ndeterminate is to be ambiguous, to be anything is to be more than that\nthing. If it were not more\u2014other\u2014than X, it would\nnot even be X. We may think about this in terms of the status\nof a \u201cfact\u201d. Emerson says in his essay,\n\u201cHistory\u201d (1841):\n\n\nTime dissipates to shining ether the solid angularity of facts. No\nanchor, no cable, no fences avail to keep a fact a fact.\n\n\nHe meant that every historical fact registers \u201cat a\ndistance\u201d, in other times and places, taking on the role of an\never-ramifying metaphor that applies to more and more individual\ncases, with more and more diverse and rich implications. With a few\nsmall modifications, this brings us close to the Tiantai view: all we\nneed to do is specify that \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cfact\u201d\nare not really two different things, with the former acting to\nambiguate the solidity of the latter, but are in reality two sides of\nthe same thing, two aspects of a single process, in fact are\nultimately synonyms. Time is just the addition of other facts. New\nfacts are just the presence of additional time. In the Tiantai view\nthese new facts are not imposed on the initial fact from without, but\nare posited as the context which alone made it a fact in the first\nplace, made it determinate as just this fact. \u201cTime\u201d just\nmeans the self-positing of both itself and other facts by any fact.\nTime makes facts facts, and unmakes facts by making more facts, all of\nwhich are intrinsic to the first fact: history is the positing and\ntranscending, the self-establishment and self-recontextualization of\nany given fact.\n\nPut another way, let us stipulate that a fact\u2014any determination\nabout what is so\u2014is something that is in principle knowable, and\nthat knowability implies a subject-object relation, and therefore a\n\u201cdistance\u201d or separation, some space away from the\nfact-to-be-known. That means that a fact is only a fact if there is\nsomething outside of it, another fact, another time, a place to view\nit from; it doesn\u2019t count as a fact unless it can impact on some\nother site, unless it relates to some otherness. But that means that\nits journey out beyond itself to otherness is intrinsic to its very\nfacticity, and it is this journey out beyond itself that Emerson\ndenotes with the word \u201ctime\u201d. To be thus and so, a fact\nmust be viewable from elsewhere, and elsewhere, whether in physical or\nin conceptual space, implies the illimitable positing of still other\nalternate perspectives from which to be seen, facts to impact,\nviewpoints to interpret and metaphorically internalize the initial\nfact. Determinacy implies limit, limit implies space, space implies\ninfinity of other spaces, of other perspectives, of other contexts.\nFor something to be a fact is for it to intrinsically posit distances\nfrom itself, and thus to be viewable otherwise.\n\nMost simply, we can say that for Tiantai time itself simply\nis the continual \u201copening of the provisional to reveal\nthe real\u201d: an unceasing process of self-recontexualization where\nthe past on the one hand remains unchangeable and on the other is\nconstantly changing with each recontextualization. A moment of time is\na recontextualization of the all the past. This also implies that the\nTiantai notion of interpervasion of past, present and future, and of\nthe \u201cinherent inclusion\u201d of all entities in each, is very\nfar from resulting in a static picture of the universe devoid of any\ngenuine creativity. For in Tiantai, each moment of time brings with it\nnot only a new set of actual occasions, but a new set of\n\u201ceternal principles\u201d\u2014categorical obligations,\neternal objects, laws, universals. Each moment is effectively the\ncreation of a new God who determines anew the character of the rest of\nthe universe and of all the past and future.\n\nA moment, to be a moment, must be surrounded by other moments, from\nwhich it differs. \u201cNow\u201d must be different from\n\u201cthen\u201d. But that means \u201cnow\u201d must\nrelate to \u201cthen\u201d. The \u201cthen\u201d is part\nof the world of the \u201cnow\u201d, against which it defines\nitself, to which it stands in necessary contrast. This contrast cannot\nbe either internal or external to the \u201cnow\u201d and to the\n\u201cthen\u201d. \u201cNow\u201d is really\n\u201cnow-then\u201d, and \u201cthen\u201d is really\n\u201cthen-now\u201d. This is easy to understand if we consider the\nstate of the entire totality of being at moment M and at\nmoment M+1. The state of things at M is thought to\nhave the power to cause the arising of the state of things at\nM+1. But if M is gone when M+1 arrives, it\ncannot \u201creach\u201d M+1 to do anything to it; it is\nalready gone, non-existent, and thus can do nothing. If the state of\nthings at M continues to exist when M+1 arrives,\nhowever, time has failed to move ahead, or we must admit the\ncoexistence of two alternate total states of being at the same time.\nIf the appearance of M+1 does not necessitate the\ndisappearance of M (which by our hypothesis possesses the\npower to bring about M+1), M would then continue to\ngenerate precisely M+1 repeatedly forever. In either case,\ntime would not be possible, and no real entities could arise. Moments\nof time are neither same nor different; they are present as one\nanother, the past as present as future, the future as past and\npresent, the present as past and future. The past is not yet\nover\u2014every moment of the present and future reveals more about\nthe past and its infinite changes, for they are non-different from it,\nthough allowing it to appear as these new moments. The\npresent never begins\u2014however far back you look, you will always\nbe able to find all the characteristics of the present there,\nunchanged though appearing as some former moment. The present\nnever ends\u2014all future moments are further disclosures about this\npresent moment of experience happening right now.\n",
