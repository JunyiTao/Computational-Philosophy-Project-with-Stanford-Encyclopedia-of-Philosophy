    "main_text": "Falaquera as an encyclopedist\n4. Falaquera as an encyclopedist\n\n\nFalaquera\u2019s use of his sources is a bit different in his\nDe\u2018ot ha-Filosofim, one of the first Hebrew\nencyclopedias of science and philosophy, and the third book of the\ntrilogy. Falaquera states his goals and methods in his encyclopedia in\nhis introduction.\n\n\nI endeavored to translate these opinions [of the philosophers] from\nArabic to Hebrew, and to compile them from the books that are\nscattered there, so that whoever wishes to grasp these [opinions] will\nfind them in one book, and will not need to weary himself by reading\nall the books [on these subjects], for all the opinions [of the\nphilosophers], general and particular, on natural science and divine\nscience are included in this composition. \u2026 There is not a word\nin this entire composition that I say of my own; rather all that I\nwrite are the words of Aristotle as explained in the commentaries of\nthe scholar Averroes, for he was the last of the commentators and he\nincorporated what was best from the [earlier]\ncommentaries.\n\n\nFalaquera\u2019s goal in the encyclopedia, his longest work, was to make\npossible the serious study of the sciences by his fellow Jews. The\nencyclopedia is divided into two parts, one on the natural beings and\none on the divine ones. The first part basically follows the\ntraditional order of Aristotle\u2019s books on natural science. When\nFalaquera writes that there \u201cis not a word in this entire\ncomposition that I say of my own,\u201d he is hardly\nexaggerating. His main source in the work is usually the middle\ncommentaries of Averroes or his epitomes when the middle commentaries\nwere not available. These texts are often translated literally, but\nwith no hesitation to abridge them and to blend them with other\nsources, in particular other commentaries by Averroes, for the sake of\nclarification or completeness. Short passages from other works and\nother authors are inserted when it suits Falaquera\u2019s purposes. But\napart from connecting phrases, references to other parts of the book,\nand occasional attributions, there is indeed hardly a word that is\nFalaquera\u2019s own. It is thus remarkable that Falaquera was often able\nto improve upon his sources and even intentionally part from them\nsolely through his combining of texts. It has been shown, for example,\nthat \u201cby advisedly and creatively combining [Averroes\u2019]\ncommentaries [on the Meteorology],\u201d Falaquera was able\nto present an account of Aristotle\u2019s teachings clearer than that of\neither of Averroes\u2019 commentaries [Fontaine, \u201cWhy Is the Sea\nSalty?\u201d 213\u2013218], and that by inserting a brief passage\nfrom Avicenna into his abridged paraphrase of Averroes\u2019 Epitome of\nthe Parva naturalia, he was able to provide a response to\nAverroes\u2019 argument therein that theoretical knowledge cannot be\nacquired in dreams [Harvey, \u201cFalaquera\u2019s De\u2018ot\nha-Filosofim,\u201d 232\u2013233]. Other such examples abound, but\ncan usually be detected only through a careful comparison of the\nencyclopedia with its sources. Falaquera\u2019s intended reader, who did\nnot know Arabic, would thus have been unaware of his skill and\nparticular goals in weaving together his sources, but this would not\nhave bothered Falaquera. He had a far greater goal in mind. The\nDe\u2018ot ha-Filosofim presents the reader with an\nambitious and comprehensive account of Aristotelian science and\nphilosophy, indeed the first full in-depth treatment of Aristotelian\nscience in Hebrew.\n",
