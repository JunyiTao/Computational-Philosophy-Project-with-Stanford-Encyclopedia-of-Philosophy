Other Uses of the Term\n\n\nIn the philosophy of mind, the phrase \u201cmethodological\nindividualism\u201d is commonly associated with a claim made by Jerry\nFodor concerning the individuation of psychological states (1980,\n1987, 42). It is important to emphasize that Fodor\u2019s use of the term\nhas nothing in common with its traditional use in the philosophy of\nsocial science. Fodor introduces it by way of a distinction between\n\u201cmethodological individualism\u201d and \u201cmethodological\nsolipsism.\u201d His goal is to deal with variations on the\ntwin-earth problem, introduced by Hilary Putnam. The question is\nwhether an individual with a belief about water on earth, where water\nis made up of H2O, has the same belief as an\nindividual with a belief about water in a parallel universe, where\nwater has the same appearance and behavior, but happens to be made up\nof XYZ. The \u201cexternalist\u201d is one who says that they are\nnot the same, whereas an \u201cinternalist\u201d like Fodor wants to\nsay that they are \u2013 speaking roughly, that the content of\nbeliefs is determined by what is in the agent\u2019s head, and not what is\nin the world.\n\n\nThe issue comes down to one concerning the individuation of mental\nstates. How do we determine what is and is not the \u201csame\u201d\nbelief? Fodor begins by introducing the constraint that he calls\n\u201cmethodological individualism,\u201d viz., \u201cthe doctrine\nthat psychological states are individuated with respect to their\ncausal powers\u201d (1987, 42). This implies, among other\nthings, that if one psychological state is incapable of causing\nanything different to happen than some other psychological state, then\nthe two must be the same. \u201cMethodological solipsism\u201d is\nthe stronger claim that \u201cpsychological states are individuated\nwithout respect to the semantic evaluations\u201d (1987,\n42). This implies, among other things, that even if one state is\n\u201ctrue\u201d in some context and another is \u201cfalse,\u201d\nthe two may still turn out to be the same. As Fodor goes on to point\nout, the semantic evaluation of a mental state will typically be\nrelational, e.g. whether certain beliefs about water are true will\ndepend upon how things happen to stand with water in the world; thus\nmethodological solipsism has the consequence of precluding one type of\nrelational property from playing a role in the individuation of mental\nstates. It is therefore \u201cindividualistic\u201d in the everyday\nsense of the term, since it suggests that what\u2019s going on in the\nagent\u2019s head does most or all of the work in the individuation of\nmental states.  Methodological individualism, on the other hand,\n\u201cdoes not prohibit the relational individuation of mental\nstates; it just says that no property of mental states,\nrelational or otherwise, counts taxonomically unless it affects causal\npowers\u201d(1987, 42). Thus it is very unclear why Fodor chooses to\ncall this a form of \u201cindividualism,\u201d since these relations\ncould also be relations to other speakers, and not just the physical\nword.\n\n\nThere is considerable infelicity in Fodor\u2019s choice of terms. He is\nable to offer a cogent account of why methodological individualism\ncounts as a methodological constraint. He argues that the desire to\nalign terminological distinctions with objects having different causal\npowers is \u201cone which follows simply from the scientist\u2019s goal of\ncausal explanation and which, therefore, all scientific taxonomies\nmust obey\u201d (1987, 42). Thus it is a methodological\nprecept. (Although one can see clearly here the stark contrast between\nFodor\u2019s use of the term and that of Weber or Hayek, for whom the\nability of the social scientist to provide something beyond\nmerely causal explanation was what imposed the methodological\ncommitment to the action-theoretic level of analysis.) It is simply\nunclear why Fodor chooses to call it individualism. With\nmethodological solipsism, on the other hand, one can see why he calls\nit solipsism, but it is unclear what makes it methodological. Indeed,\nFodor goes on to state that \u201csolipsism (construed as prohibiting\nthe relational taxonomy of mental states) is unlike individualism in\nthat it couldn\u2019t conceivably follow from any general considerations\nabout scientific goals and practices. \u2018Methodological\nsolipsism\u2019 is, in fact, an empirical theory about the\nmind.\u201d(1987, 43). Thus in Fodor\u2019s use of the terms,\n\u201cmethodological individualism\u201d is not really\nindividualistic, and \u201cmethodological solipsism\u201d is not\nreally methodological.\n",
