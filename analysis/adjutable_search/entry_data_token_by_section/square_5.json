    "main_text": "Origin of the Square of Opposition || Aristotle\u2019s Formulation of the O Form\n2.2 Aristotle\u2019s Formulation of the O Form\n\n\nAckrill\u2019s translation contains something a bit unexpected: Aristotle\u2019s\narticulation of the O form is not the\nfamiliar \u2018Some S is not P\u2019 or one of its\nvariants; it is rather \u2018Not every S is\nP\u2019. With this wording, Aristotle\u2019s doctrine\nautomatically escapes the modern criticism. (This holds for his views\nthroughout De\n Interpretatione.[5])\n For assume again that \u2018S\u2019 is an empty term, and\nsuppose that this makes the I form \u2018Some\nS is P\u2019 false. Its contradictory, the\nE form: \u2018No S is P\u2019, is\nthus true, and this entails the O form in Aristotle\u2019s\nformulation: \u2018Not every S is P\u2019, which\nmust therefore be true. When the O form was worded\n\u2018Some S is not P\u2019 this bothered us, but\nwith it worded \u2018Not every S is P\u2019 it\nseems plainly right. Recall that we are granting that \u2018Every\nS is P\u2019 has existential import, and so if\n\u2018S\u2019 is empty the A form must be\nfalse. But then \u2018Not every S is P\u2019\nshould be true, as Aristotle\u2019s square requires.\n\n\nOn this view affirmatives have existential import, and\nnegatives do not\u2014a point that became elevated to a general\nprinciple in late medieval\n times.[6]\n The ancients thus did\nnot see the incoherence of the square as formulated by Aristotle\nbecause there was no incoherence to see.\n",
