    "main_text": "Politics, Part One: The Ideal Constitution || Communism\n4.2 Communism\n\n\nOne of the most striking features of the ideal city is its abolition \nof private families and sharp limitation on private property in the \ntwo guardian classes. Starting with Aristotle (Politics II 1\u20135), this communism in the \nRepublic\u2019s ideal city has been the target of confusion and \ncriticism (see Nussbaum 1980, Stalley 1991, Mayhew 1997). On the one hand, Aristotle (at Politics \n1264a11\u201322) and others have expressed uncertainty about the extent of\ncommunism in the ideal city. On the other, they have argued that communism of any extent has no place in an ideal political community.\n\n\nThere should be no confusion about private property. When Socrates \ndescribes the living situation of the guardian classes in the ideal \ncity (415d\u2013417b), he is clear that private property will be sharply \nlimited, and when he discusses the kinds of regulations the rulers \nneed to have in place for the whole city (421c ff.), he is clear that\nthe producers will have enough private property to make the \nregulation of wealth and poverty a concern. But confusion about the scope\nof communal living arrangements is possible, due to the casual way in\nwhich Socrates introduces this controversial proposal. The abolition \nof private families enters as an afterthought. Socrates says that \nthere is no need to list everything that the rulers will do, for if \nthey are well educated, they will see what is necessary, including \nthe fact that \u201cmarriage, the having of wives, and the procreation of \nchildren must be governed as far as possible by the old proverb: \nfriends possess everything in common\u201d (423e6\u2013424a2). It is not \nimmediately clear whether this governance should extend over the \nwhole city or just the guardian classes. Still, when he is pressed to\ndefend the communal arrangements (449c ff.), Socrates focuses on the \nguardian classes (see, e.g., 461e and 464b), and it seems most \nreasonable to suppose that the communism about families extends just \nas far as the communism about property does, on the grounds that only\nthe best people can live as friends with such things in common (cf. \nLaws 739c\u2013740b).\n\n\nTo what extent the communism of the ideal city is problematic is a \nmore complicated question. The critics claim that communism is\neither undesirable or impossible. The charge of impossibility essentially \nextends one of Plato\u2019s insights: while Plato believes that most \npeople are incapable of living without private property and private \nfamilies, the critics argue that all people are incapable of living \nwithout private property. This criticism fails if there is clear \nevidence of people who live communally. But the critic can fall back \non the charge of undesirability. Here the critic needs to identify \nwhat is lost by giving up on private property and private \nfamilies, and the critic needs to show that this is more valuable \nthan any unity and extended sense of family the communal arrangements\noffer. It is not clear how this debate should go. Plato\u2019s position on\nthis question is a stubbornly persistent ideal, despite the equally \nstubborn persistence of criticism.\n",
