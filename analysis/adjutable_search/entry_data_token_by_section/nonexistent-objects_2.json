    "main_text": "Historical Roots: Alexius Meinong and the Problem of Intentionality\n2. Historical Roots: Alexius Meinong and the Problem of Intentionality\n\nPhilosophical writings on nonexistent objects in the 20th and 21st\ncentury usually take as their starting point the so-called\n\u201ctheory of objects\u201d of the Austrian philosopher Alexius\nMeinong (1853\u20131920). Therefore, it is appropriate to give an\noutline of the basic principles of and motives behind this theory.\n(For a detailed presentation see the entry on\n Meinong.)\n\nMeinong was concerned about the problem of intentional states which\nare not directed at anything existent. The starting point of this\nproblem is the so-called \u201cprinciple of intentionality\u201d,\nwhich says that mental phenomena are characterized by an\n\u201cintentional directedness\u201d towards an object. For\ninstance, to love is always to love something, to imagine is always to\nimagine something, and so forth. In other words, every intentional act\nis \u201cabout\u201d something. The problem is that sometimes people\nimagine, desire or fear things that do not exist. Some people fear the\ndevil, although the devil doesn\u2019t exist. Many people hope for\npeace in the Middle East. But there is no peace in the Middle East.\nPonce the Leon searched for the fountain of youth, even though it\ndoesn\u2019t exist. It is easy to imagine a golden mountain, even if\nno such thing exists.\n\nCases like these seem to be clear counterexamples to the principle of\nintentionality. However, many philosophers found this principle too\nappealing to be given up completely. While some came to the conclusion\nthat intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not\nrequire the existence of an object (see, for instance, Brentano 1874,\nPrior 1971, Searle 1983, Crane 2013), Meinong offered another\nsolution: there is indeed an object for every mental state\nwhatsoever\u2014if not an existent object then at least a nonexistent\n one.[3]\n\nThe problem of intentionality may still count as one of the most\nimportant motivations for thinking there are nonexistent\n objects.[4]\n But there are other motivations as well.\n",
