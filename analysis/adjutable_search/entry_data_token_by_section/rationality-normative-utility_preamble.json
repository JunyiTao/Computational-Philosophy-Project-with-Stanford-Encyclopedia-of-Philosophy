    "main_text": "\n\n\nWe must often make decisions under conditions of uncertainty.\nPursuing a degree in biology may lead to lucrative employment, or to\nunemployment and crushing debt. A doctor\u2019s appointment may result in\nthe early detection and treatment of a disease, or it may be a waste\nof money. Expected utility theory is an account of how to choose\nrationally when you are not sure which outcome will result from your\nacts. Its basic slogan is: choose the act with the highest expected\nutility.\n\n\nThis article discusses expected utility theory as a normative\ntheory\u2014that is, a theory of how people should make\ndecisions. In classical economics, expected utility theory is often\nused as a descriptive theory\u2014that is, a theory of how\npeople do make decisions\u2014or as a predictive\ntheory\u2014that is, a theory that, while it may not accurately model\nthe psychological mechanisms of decision-making, correctly predicts\npeople\u2019s choices. Expected utility theory makes faulty predictions\nabout people\u2019s decisions in many real-life choice situations (see\nKahneman & Tversky 1982); however, this does not settle whether\npeople should make decisions on the basis of expected utility\nconsiderations.\n\n\nThe expected utility of an act is a weighted average of the\nutilities of each of its possible outcomes, where the utility\nof an outcome measures the extent to which that outcome is preferred,\nor preferable, to the alternatives. The utility of each outcome is\nweighted according to the probability that the act will lead to that\noutcome. Section 1 fleshes out this basic definition of expected\nutility in more rigorous terms, and discusses its relationship to\nchoice. Section 2 discusses two types of arguments for expected\nutility theory: representation theorems, and long-run statistical\narguments. Section 3 considers objections to expected utility\ntheory; section 4 discusses its applications in philosophy of\nreligion, economics, ethics, and epistemology.\n",
