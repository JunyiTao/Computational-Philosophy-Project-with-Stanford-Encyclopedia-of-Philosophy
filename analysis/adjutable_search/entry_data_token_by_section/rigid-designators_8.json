    "main_text": "Philosophical Work for Rigidity || The Contingent A Priori\n3.2 The Contingent A Priori\n\nAccording to Kripke, a proper understanding of rigidity also reveals\nthat some contingent statements are a priori. Kripke considers the\nstandard meter stick, which has been used to define the length of one\nmeter. Someone decreed that the expression \u2018one meter\u2019 is\nto be used for the unit of length of that stick, perhaps at a certain\ntime in the stick\u2019s existence. The stick, S, might not have\nbeen the length that it was at the time \u2018one meter\u2019 was\ncoined: had it been heated or cooled it might have been longer or\nshorter. As things are, it was not heated or cooled. So the sentence\n\u2018One meter = the length of S (at time\nt0)\u2019 is true in the actual world but it is\nfalse in some possible worlds: it is contingently true. Yet S\nhas been used to define \u2018one meter\u2019, in the sense\nthat it fixes the reference (see above), so the definers of \u2018one\nmeter\u2019 know a priori the truth of the sentence \u2018The length\none meter is instantiated by S (at time\nt0)\u2019. The reason that the sentence is\ncontingently true is that \u2018one meter\u2019 is a rigid\ndesignator for the length one meter. \u2018The length of S\n(at time t0)\u2019 is, on the other hand, a\nnon-rigid designator for one meter; in this world it designates one\nmeter but in other worlds, those in which S is heated or\ncooled, \u2018the length of S (at time\nt0)\u2019 designates other lengths.\n\nThe contingent a priori has not been as widely discussed as the\nnecessary a posteriori. The introduction of the contingent a priori is\nperhaps less surprising than the introduction of the necessary a\nposteriori, in view of the plausible contingency of a priori\nstatements that philosophers all along recognized, like the plausible\ncontingency of the statement, as uttered in a context, \u2018I\nexist\u2019. Further, Kripke\u2019s examples of the contingent a priori\nare perhaps more controversial than his examples of the necessary a\nposteriori. Many dispute that the examples really are examples of the\ncontingent a priori (Donnellan 1977; Hughes 2004, pp. 84\u2013107;\nPlantinga 1974, pp. 8\u20139n.; Salmon 1987\u20131988; cf. Kripke 2019, Other Internet Resources for a defense; Oppy 1994; Salmon 2020 distinguishes an interesting notion related to the contingent a priori that Kripke has allegedly identified). And even if they are contingent and a priori, many feel they\nlack much significance. They are not \u201cscary,\u201d as Donnellan\nputs it (also Fitch 2004, p. 121).  On the other hand, confusions are\nlike loose threads: they sometimes work their way to apparently remote\nmaterial. Confusion about the contingent a priori can and arguably\ndoes lead to confusion and apparent paradox in unsuspected areas of\nphilosophy (an alleged example is discussed in LaPorte 2003). Kripke\n(1980, pp. 14\u201315) recalls that considerations about the\ncontingent a priori led in his mind to a number of clarifications\nconcerning designation, which again is hardly surprising given the\ninterconnectedness of different issues in a fabric.\n",
