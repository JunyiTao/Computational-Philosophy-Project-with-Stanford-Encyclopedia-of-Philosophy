    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind\n3. Philosophy of Mind\n\nPhilosophy of mind or what is called descriptive psychology represents\none of the main axes of Stumpf\u2019s program in philosophy. His\ntreatises in this domain are quite diversified, ranging from animal\nand developmental psychology to acoustic psychology and Gestalt\npsychology. Other than his Raumbuch, the book that made\nStumpf renowned in psychology is Psychology of Sound\n(published in two volumes in 1883 and 1890) which was widely received\nin Germany and England (see reviews by P. Natorp, A. Meinong, T. Lipps\nand J. Sully). In this book, as in most of his treatises on\npsychology, Stumpf\u2019s approach is similar to that of\nBrentano\u2019s descriptive psychology. It differs from experimental\nand physiological psychology in that it conceptually analyses and\ndescribes what physiological psychology explains through the\ndescriptive apparatus of the natural sciences such as biology or\nphysiology. Between these two branches of psychology there is a form\nof division of labor wherein the first analyses and describes what the\nother explains. However, descriptive psychology has a methodological\npriority over experimental psychology in that the analysis and\ndescription of the explanandum is a prerequisite to its\nexplanation. The two main tasks assigned to descriptive psychology are\nthe analysis and the classification of mental states (also called acts\nor mental functions). In his influential study entitled\n\u201cPhenomena and Mental Functions,\u201d Stumpf shows how\nphenomena are closely linked in that they form a real unity, which can\nonly be separated by abstraction. He conceives of phenomena as unitary\nwholes and not as aggregates, and claims that they are perceived as\nconcrete and unitary wholes. As such, phenomena are the contents of\nsensations that are characterized by certain properties or attributes,\nfor example extension, intensity, brightness, etc., and these contents\nof sensations are first-order phenomena as opposed to second-order\nphenomena like \u201cmnemonic images\u201d and phenomena such as\ncolor or sound, to the extent that they \u201care merely\nrepresented.\u201d Although Stumpf rarely uses the concept of\nintentionality, one might say that mental functions are distinct from\nphysical phenomena in that they are related to their objects by\nintentional relations.\n\nPsychical functions have a specific structure that is characterized by\nthe distinction between the content of a function and its relation to\nan object. This relationship is characterized by the notion of\nspecific content, to which Stumpf refers with the concept of\nGebilde (product), and by the quality and matter of an act.\nIn an act of judgment, for example, the quality of an act consists in\nan affirmation or a negation, and it is characterized linguistically\nby the copula \u201cis\u201d or its negation. The\n\u201cmatter\u201d (Materie) of a judgment is what remains\nwhen one disregards the affirmation and negation, i.e. the mere\ncomplex of presentations (subject and predicate without the copula).\nIn addition to its quality and matter, the judgment conveys a specific\n\u201cformation\u201d or product (Gebilde) that Stumpf\nsometimes calls a state of affairs. They are \u201ccorrelates\u201d\nof thought and distinguish themselves from the individual act, of\nwhich they are the content, through their objective character. All\nother functions, from the simplest to the most complex, have their\nspecific content. For example, the act of abstraction, which is\nresponsible for the formation of concepts, has a concept as its\nspecific content. In the field of more complex functions such as\nemotion, desire, and will, Stumpf maintains that we must also\npresuppose specific contents which he calls values.\n\nDescriptive psychology\u2019s second task is the classification of\nacts or psychical functions. This classification is based on the\ndistinction between two classes of acts: intellectual and emotional\nfunctions. All functions that fall under either of these two classes\nhave relationships ranging from the simplest to the most complex, so\nthat functions of the second class presuppose, and are based on, lower\nlevel functions of the first class. This class of intellectual\nfunctions subsumes all acts ranging from sense perception to judgment.\nSense perception in this classification has a particular status\nbecause it gives direct access to first-order phenomena and as such it\nis the function of consciousness (attention) through which something\nis noticed or apprehended. It serves as the foundation of all\nfunctions in that it provides them with their sensory material.\nBetween perception and judgment, there is a series of intermediate\nacts: the act of presentation, which has as content second order\nphenomena, the act of abstraction and what Stumpf calls the acts of\nsynthesis, whose specific contents are sets (Inbegriffe).\n\nFrom the class of intellectual functions, Stumpf sets apart the class\nof feelings or emotional functions. Stumpf\u2019s works in the field\nof emotions led to a debate with Brentano and were the subject of many\ndiscussions, particularly by the American psychologist E. B.\nTitchener. (E. B. Titchener, 1908, 1927; R. Reisenzein and W.\nSch\u00f6npflug, 1992; D. Fisette, 2013) At issue was whether the\nnature of pleasure provided by an object such as a work of art, for\ninstance, is intentional, as was the case in Brentano\u2019s theory\nwherein it is closely related to the class of emotions, or phenomenal\nas in Husserl and the sensualist theories of James and Mach. Stumpf\nclaims that there is a specific difference between sense-feelings\n(bodily pleasure, pain, etc.) which are sensory qualities like sound\nand color, and emotions (joy, sadness, anger, disgust, etc.) which are\nintentional states directed towards states of affairs. Between\nemotional and intellectual functions, there is the same relation of\nfoundation as that between judgment and perception, since judgment, or\nmore precisely states of affairs, are presupposed by emotional\nfunctions which, although more complex, are nevertheless structured in\nthe same way. In addition to emotions, this class of feelings subsumes\nthe acts of desire and will, upon which the field of ethics is based.\nBetween emotions and the will, there is a hierarchy comparable to that\nof the class of intellectual states, with the difference being however\nthat the phenomenal basis of the class of emotional acts is nothing\nother than sense-feelings (pleasure and displeasure). Emotions belong\nto the subclass of passive feelings while desire and will belong to\nthe subclass of active feelings. Feelings are passive in that they\nhave something existent as an object (that is any object of a true\njudgment) while active feelings are related to a duty (object of a\nvoluntary act). Values are the specific content of the class of active\nfeelings (desire and will) while the contents of an emotion are\nvalues. Emotions are evaluative states concerning the content of a\njudgment and the evaluative element of emotions lies in the positive\nor negative stand taken with respect to the judged state of affairs.\nThe difference between these two classes of acts lies therefore in\ntheir quality, meaning their negative or positive stand\n(Stellungsnahme) regarding their object: affirmation and\nnegation in the case of judgment, love and hate in the case of the\nentire class of feelings. The relation of foundation between emotions\nand judgments or beliefs presupposes, on the one hand, a causal\nrelation between states of belief and valuation (or stand), and on the\nother hand, an intentional relation between the content of belief and\nthe emotion. From this point of view, jealousy, to use Stumpf\u2019s\nexample, would be a negative stand and a valuation of the state of\naffairs that a given person possesses and which another person wants\nor covets for herself, but which she does not possess; and this state\nis caused by the belief or judgment (true) that this state of affairs\nexists (besteht).\n",
