    "main_text": "Analyses of Disposition Ascriptions || The Simple Conditional Analysis and Counterexamples\n1.2 The Simple Conditional Analysis and Counterexamples\n\nThe simplest analysis of dispositions in terms of counterfactual\nconditionals is the Simple Conditional Analysis:\n\nSCA.\nAn object is disposed to \\(M\\) when \\(C\\) iff it\nwould \\(M\\) if it were the case that \\(C\\).\n\nNotice that the analysandum of SCA is an ascription\nof a\nschematic canonical disposition. SCA has\nbeen explicitly endorsed by Ryle (1949), Goodman (1954), and Quine\n(1960) and implicitly by countless others.\n\nCounterexamples to SCA first raised by Martin\n(1994) exploit the fact that some dispositions are\n\u2018finkish\u2019 in the sense that the conditions for an object\u2019s\nacquiring or losing disposition \\(D\\) might be the same\nas \\(D\\)\u2019s stimulus conditions. Suppose that an electrical\nwire is live just in case it has the canonical disposition to conduct\nelectricity when touched by a conductor. (This is an artificial\ndefinition that might differ from a dictionary definition of\n\u2018live\u2019.) SCA then entails that a wire\nis live iff it would conduct electricity if touched by a conductor.\nSuppose now that a dead wire is connected to an electro-fink, a device\nwhich senses when the wire is about to be touched by a conductor, and\nwhich makes the wire live in every such circumstance. If the wire were\ntouched by a conductor then, thanks to the work of the device, the\nwire would become live, and so would conduct electricity. Hence the\nwire would conduct electricity if touched by a conductor. Being dead,\nhowever, it is not disposed to conduct electricity when touched by a\nconductor. The device can also operate on a reverse cycle, attaching\nto a naturally live wire but removing its property of being live if\never it is touched by a conductor. In this case, although the wire is\ndisposed to conduct electricity when touched by a conductor, the\n\u2018reverse-cycle\u2019 fink ensures that the associated\ncounterfactual conditional is false. Martin\u2019s examples are special\ncases of what R. K. Shope (1978) calls \u2018The Conditional Fallacy\nin Contemporary Philosophy\u2019, roughly the fallacy of ignoring the\nfact that, in a purported conditional analysis, the truth or falsity\nof the analysandum might depend on the truth or falsity of the\nantecedent of the conditional analysans.\n\nAnother kind of counterexample to SCA, due to Johnston\n(1992) and Bird (1998), involves a fragile glass that is carefully\nprotected by packing material. It is claimed that the glass is\ndisposed to break when struck but, if struck, it wouldn\u2019t break thanks\nto the work of the packing material. There is an important difference\nbetween this example and Martin\u2019s: the packing material would prevent\nthe breaking of the glass not by removing its\ndisposition to break when struck but by blocking the process that\nwould otherwise lead from striking to breaking. This difference will\nbe important in the context of evaluating Lewis\u2019s analysis of\ndispositions in\n section 1.4.\n The packing material is called a masker (Johnston) or antidote (Bird)\nto the glass\u2019s disposition at issue (see Choi 2003 for a refinement of\nthe masking counterexample to SCA).\n\nStill another kind of counterexample to SCA, discussed\nby Smith (1977), Prior, Pargetter & Jackson (1982), Lewis (1997),\nand Armstrong (1997), involves an interfering factor in virtue of\nwhich \\(x\\) mimics the manifestation of\ndisposition \\(D\\) although it does not\npossess \\(D\\). When a styrofoam dish is struck, it makes a\ndistinctive sound. The Hater of Styrofoam is within earshot of it.\nWhat if it were struck? The Hater of Styrofoam would hear the\ndistinctive sound and tear the styrofoam dish apart. It seems evident\nthat the dish is not disposed to break when struck. If struck,\nhowever, it would break due to the interference of the Hater of\nStyrofoam, which goes against SCA. Here the Hater of\nStyrofoam is called a mimicker of the disposition to break when\nstruck, meaning that it makes it the case that the dish, which does\nnot have the disposition, mimics its manifestation. (This example is\ndue to Lewis 1997.)\n\nNotice that finking, masking and mimicking situations are ubiquitous\n(Fara 2005). Extremely fragile and valuable objects, for example,\nare routinely protected by various kinds of\npackaging material. See also Bird 1998.\n",
