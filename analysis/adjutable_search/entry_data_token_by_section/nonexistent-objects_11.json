    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness || Fictionalism and Indifferentism\n5.2 Fictionalism and Indifferentism\n\nIn recent years, something close to the de-ontologization\nstrategy\u2014or rather a bundle of more or less similar\nstrategies\u2014became prominent, known under the heading\n\u201cfictionalism\u201d. The basic idea of fictionalism is, roughly\nput, that utterances belonging to a certain region of discourse are\nnot to be taken literally, that speakers producing such utterances\nhave a fictional attitude towards them and are engaged in a sort of\npretense or make-believe. (For an overview of the diverse versions of\nfictionalism as well as a succinct presentation of its most important\npros and cons see the entry on\n fictionalism.)\n\nFictionalism differs from the de-ontologization strategy since\nfictionalists do not claim that the relevant utterances are literally\ntrue; to the contrary, according to fictionalism, certain kinds of\ndiscourse consist of utterances that are false (if taken literally),\nbut nevertheless it may be useful in some respects to stick to that\nsorts of discourse.\n\nA general assessment of fictionalism is difficult since the positions\nincluded under this heading differ considerably from each other. Much\ndepends on how exactly the \u201cfictional attitude\u201d is spelled\nout. Many versions of fictionalism are prone to the\n\u201cphenomenological objection\u201d: external talk about\nfictitious objects\u2014to mention one of the applications of the\nfictionalist strategy that is particularly relevant in the context of\nthe present entry\u2014does not feel like \u201cmake-believe\u201d;\nintrospection does not reveal that we are engaged in any kind of\npretense when we say things like \u201cSherlock Holmes is one of the\nmost famous characters of popular literature\u201d and the like.\n\nA position inspired by and in important respects similar to\nfictionalism that, however, avoids the phenomenological objection is\nEklund\u2019s \u201cindifferentism\u201d. Indifferentism is the\nview that speakers outside the \u201cphilosophy room\u201d are often\nsimply indifferent with regards of the ontological implications of\ntheir utterances and thus are not committed to the existence of those\nentities whose existence is implied by their utterances. As Eklund\nemphasizes, however, indifferentism does not say anything about which\nentities one should accept in one\u2019s ontology; it is, in\nthis sense, not an ontological thesis.
