    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Explanatory Direction\n1.3 Explanatory Direction\n\n\nA final preliminary distinction between internalist views concerns\ntheir direction of explanation. As characterized thus\nfar, the various internalist theses merely posit a necessary connection\nbetween the existence of reasons, on the one hand, and facts about\nmotivation or motivational states, on the other, and do not distinguish\nbetween competing ways of explaining this necessary connection.\nDo we have reasons because we have (counterfactual or actual)\nmotivation or desire, or do we have motivation or desire\nbecause we have reasons? (Or is there some third possibility?)\nThe Humean Theory of Reasons is standardly understood to claim not only\nthat we have reasons only if we have certain desires, but\nfurther that we have those reasons because we have those\ndesires. We interpret it accordingly in the rest of this\narticle.\n\nHTR (revised): If there is a reason for\nsomeone to do something, then she must have some desire that would be\nserved by her doing it, which is the source of her reason.\n\n\nIt is natural to understand any Actual State internalist view as\nclaiming this direction of explanation. Since there surely can be\nnormative reasons for an agent to act of which she is unaware, it is\nimplausible that a consideration could be a reason for her to act only\nif she has an actual motivating state because of it.\n\n\nCounterfactual Motivation views, however, can adopt either direction\nof explanation, and a variety of philosophers insist that the existence\nof reasons explains the relevant facts about motivation rather than\nvice versa. Consider the popular thesis that if there is a reason\nfor someone to do something, then necessarily if she is fully\nrational she will be motivated to do it. The most trivial\naccount of this kind suggests that \u2018fully rational\u2019 simply\nmeans motivated by all one\u2019s reasons. If this is the\ntruth in internalism, however, it places no constraints whatsoever on\nwhat can and cannot be an agent\u2019s practical reason; for this reason it\nis often called an externalist thesis. But the explanatory\npriority of reasons over motivation can also yield a nontrivial version\nof internalism. Consider again the thesis appealing to a\ncondition of full rationality. If by \u2018rationality\u2019 we\nmean a substantive psychological capacity involving\nparticular desires or dispositions that enable us to respond to\nreasons, then we have a form of internalism that places substantive\nconstraints on what can and cannot be a reason. For example,\nChristine Korsgaard (1986) advocates such a nontrivial version of\ninternalism, taking the counterfactual about motivation under the\ncondition of rationality to be explained by a substantive (non-trivial)\naccount of practical rationality. According to Korsgaard, an\nagent is only rational if she is consistently motivated in accordance\nwith some general principles that provide her conception of her\npractical identity. Given this account of rationality, the\ninternalist thesis above tells us that only those considerations that\nwould motivate such a principle-governed agent can be reasons for her\nto act.\n",
