Sketch of the Proof.\n\n\nKS proceed in two steps. \n\n\n(1) In the first (and decisive) step they show that two rays with\nopposite colours cannot be arbitrarily close. They first show that the\ndiagram\n \u03931\n depicted in Fig. 1 (where for the time being we ignore the colours \nspecified in the figure) can be constructed, only if \na0 and a9 are separated by an angle\n \u03b8\n with 0\n \u2264\n \u03b8\n \u2264\n sin\u22121(1/3)\n (Proof).\n\n\nFigure 1: Ten-point KS graph\n \u03931 with inconsistent colouring.\n\n\nConsider now (for a reductio ad absurdum) that a0 and\na9 have different colours. We arbitrarily colour\na0 white and a9 black. The colouring\nconstraints then force us to colour the rest of the diagram as is\ndone in Fig. 1, but this requires that a5 and a6\nare orthogonal and both white \u2014 which is forbidden. Hence, two\npoints closer than sin\u22121(1/3) cannot have different\ncolours. Contrapositively, two points of different colour cannot be\ncloser than sin\u22121(1/3).\n\n\n(2) KS now construct another quite complicated KS diagram\n \u03932\n in the following way. They consider a realization of\n \u03931\n for an angle\n \u03b8=18\u00b0\n <\nsin\u22121(1/3). Now they choose three orthogonal points\np0, q0, r0 and space interlocking\ncopies of\n \u03931\n between them such that every instance of point a9 of one\n copy of\n \u03931\n is identified with the instance of a0 of the next\ncopy. In this way five interlocking copies of\n \u03931\n are spaced between p0 and q0 and all five\ninstances of a8 are identified with r0\n(likewise five such interlocking copies are spaced between q0 and \nr0, identifying all copies of a8 with p0, \nand between p0 and r0, identifying all copies of \na8 with q0). That\n \u03932\n is constructible is borne out directly by the construction\nitself. Spacing out five copies of \u03931 with angles\n \u03b8=18\u00b0\n between instances of a0\n will space out an angle of 5x18\u00b0 = 90\u00b0 which is exactly what\nis required. Moreover, wandering from one copy of\n \u03931\n to the next between, say, p0 and q0 is\nequivalent to a rotation by 18\u00b0 of the copy about the axis through\nthe origin and r0, which evidently conserves the\northogonality between the points a0 and a9 of\nthe copy and r0.\n\n\nFigure 2: 117-point KS graph\n \u03932\n\n(From Kochen and Specker 1967, 69; by permission of the\nIndiana University Mathematics Journal)\n\n\nHowever, although\n \u03932 is\nconstructible it is not consistently colourable. From the\nfirst step we know that a copy of\n \u03931 with\n \u03b8=18\u00b0\n requires that points a0 and a9 have equal\ncolour.  Now, since a9 in one copy of\n \u03931\n is identical to a0 in the next copy, a9 in the\nsecond copy must have the same colour as a0 in the\nfirst. Indeed, by repetition of this argument all instances of\na0 must have the same colour. Now, p0,\nq0, r0 are identified with points\na0, so they must be either all white or all black \u2014 both\nof which are inconsistent with the colouring constraint that exactly\none of them be white.\n\n\nIf from the 15 copies of\n \u03931\n used in the process of constructing\n \u03932\n we subtract those points that were identified with each other, we\nend up with 117 different points. So, what KS have shown is that a set\nof 117 yes-no observables cannot consistently be assigned values in\naccordance with VC1 (or, equivalently, VC2).\n\n\nNote that in the construction of\n \u03931,\n i.e. the set of 10 points forming 22 interlocking triples, all\npoints except a9 appear in more than one triple. In\n \u03932 every\n point appears in a multiplicity of triples. It is here that the\nnoncontextuality premise is crucial to the argument: we assume that\nan arbitrary point keeps its value 1 or 0 as we move from one\northogonal triple to the next (i.e. from one maximal set of\ncompatible observables to another).\n",
