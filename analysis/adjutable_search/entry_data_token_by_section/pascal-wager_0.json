    "main_text": "Background\n1. Background\n\nIt is important to contrast Pascal\u2019s argument with various\nputative \u2018proofs\u2019 of the existence of God that had come\nbefore it. Anselm\u2019s ontological argument, Aquinas\u2019\n\u2018five ways\u2019, Descartes\u2019 ontological and cosmological\narguments, and so on, purport to prove that God exists. Pascal is\napparently unimpressed by such attempted justifications of theism:\n\u201cEndeavour \u2026 to convince yourself, not by increase of\nproofs of God\u2026\u201d Indeed, he insists that \u201cwe do not\nknow if He is \u2026\u201d. Pascal\u2019s project, then, is\nradically different. He aims to show that we\u00a0ought to\nbelieve in God, rather than that God\nexists.\u00a0And\u00a0he seeks to provide prudential\nreasons rather than evidential reasons\u00a0for believing in\nGod. To put it simply, we should wager that God exists because it is\nthe best bet. Ryan 1994 finds precursors to this line of\nreasoning in the writings of Plato, Arnobius, Lactantius, and others;\nwe might add Ghazali to his list\u2014see Palacios 1920. Franklin\n2018 presents striking parallels to Pascal\u2019s Wager by Sirmond\nand Chillingworth from 1637 and 1638 respectively, thus predating\nPascal by a few years. But what is distinctive is Pascal\u2019s\nexplicitly decision-theoretic formulation of the reasoning. In fact,\nHacking 1975 describes the Wager as \u201cthe first well-understood\ncontribution to decision theory\u201d (viii). Thus, we should pause\nbriefly to review some of the basics of that theory.\n\nIn any decision problem, the way the world is, and what an agent does,\ntogether determine an outcome for the agent. We may assign\nutilities to such outcomes, numbers that represent the degree\nto which the agent values them. It is typical to present these numbers\nin a decision table, with the columns corresponding to the various\nrelevant states of the world, and the rows corresponding to the\nvarious possible actions that the agent can perform.\n\nIn decisions under uncertainty, nothing more is\ngiven\u2014in particular, the agent does not assign subjective\nprobabilities to the states of the world. Still, sometimes rationality\ndictates a unique decision nonetheless. Consider, for example, a case\nthat will be particularly relevant here. Suppose that you have two\npossible actions, \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), and the worst outcome\nassociated with \\(A_1\\) is at least as good as the best outcome\nassociated with \\(A_2\\); suppose also that in at least one state of\nthe world, \\(A_1\\)\u2019s outcome is strictly better than\n\\(A_2\\)\u2019s. Let's say in that case that \\(A_1\\)\nsuperdominates \\(A_2\\). Then rationality seems to require you\nto perform\n \\(A_1\\).[1]\n\nExample. A magician will toss a coin. You know\nnothing about the coin\u2014it might be a normal coin, it might be\ntwo-headed, it might be two-tailed, and it might be biased to any\ndegree. Suppose that in this state of complete ignorance about the\ncoin, you do not assign any probability whatsoever to its landing\nheads. Suppose that you can either bet on heads or on tails; it costs\nnothing to bet, and you will win $1 if you bet correctly. But I will\npay you an extra $1 if you bet on heads (I especially like bets on\nheads). Your possible total pay-offs are given by this decision\ntable:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCoin lands heads\nCoin lands tails \n\nBet on heads\n2\n1 \n\nBet on tails\n0\n1  \n\n\nBetting on heads superdominates betting on tails. The worst outcome\nassociated with betting on heads (which pays $1)\u00a0 is at least as\ngood as the best outcome associated with betting on tails (which pays\n$1); and if the coin lands heads, the outcome associated with betting\non heads pays more than that associated with tails ($2 >\n$0). Moreover, it seems clear that you should bet on heads.\n\nIn decisions under risk, the agent assigns subjective\nprobabilities to the various states of the world. Assume that the\nstates of the world are independent of what the agent does. A figure\nof merit called the expected utility, or the\nexpectation of a given action can be calculated by a simple\nformula: for each state, multiply the utility that the action produces\nin that state by the state\u2019s probability; then, add these\nnumbers. According to decision theory, rationality requires you to\nperform the action of maximum expected utility (if there is one).\n\nExample. Suppose that the utility of money is linear\nin number of dollars: you value money at exactly its face value.\nSuppose now that you know that a fair\u00a0coin will be\ntossed, and so you assign probability 1/2 to heads and 1/2 to tails.\nIt costs a dollar to play the following game. If the coin lands heads,\nyou will win $3; if it lands tails, you will get nothing.\u00a0\n(Including the initial cost of playing, the total possible payoffs are\n$1 less than these respective amounts.) Should you play? Here is the\ndecision table:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCoin lands heads\nCoin lands tails \n\nPlay\n2\n\u20131 \n\nDo not play\n0\n0  \n\n\nThe expectation of playing is (2 x 1/2)\u00a0 + (\u20131 x 1/2) =\n1/2. This exceeds the expectation of not playing\u2014namely\n0\u2014so you should play.\n\nAnd now suppose that the the payoff if the coin lands heads is reduced\nby $1, so that the decision table becomes:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCoin lands heads\nCoin lands tails \n\nPlay\n1\n\u20131 \n\nDo not play\n0\n0  \n\n\nThen consistent with decision theory, you could either play or not,\nfor either way your expectation would be 0.\n\nConsiderations such as these will play a crucial role in\nPascal\u2019s arguments. It should be admitted that there are certain\nexegetical problems in presenting these arguments. Pascal never\nfinished the Pens\u00e9es, but rather left them in the form\nof notes of various sizes pinned together. Hacking 1972 describes the\n\u201cInfinite\u2014nothing\u201d as consisting of \u201ctwo\npieces of paper covered on both sides by handwriting going in all\ndirections, full of erasures, corrections, insertions, and\nafterthoughts\u201d\n (24).[2]\n This may explain why certain passages are notoriously difficult to\ninterpret, as we will see. Furthermore, our formulation of the\narguments in the parlance of modern Bayesian decision theory might\nappear somewhat anachronistic. For example, Pascal did not distinguish\nbetween what we would now call objective and\nsubjective probability, although it is clear that it is the\nlatter that is relevant to his arguments. To some extent,\n\u201cPascal\u2019s Wager\u201d now has a life of its own, and our\npresentation of it here is perfectly standard. Still, we will closely\nfollow Pascal\u2019s text, supporting our reading of his arguments as\nmuch as possible. (See also Golding 1994 for another detailed analysis\nof Pascal\u2019s reasoning, broken down into more steps than the\npresentation here.)\n\nThere is the further problem of dividing the Infinite-nothing\ninto separate arguments. We will locate three arguments that each\nconclude that rationality requires you to wager for God, although they\ninterleave in the\n text.[3]\n Finally, there is some disagreement over just what \u201cwagering\nfor God\u201d involves\u2014is it believing in God, or\nmerely engendering belief? We will conclude with a discussion\nof what Pascal meant by this.\n",
