    "main_text": "Life and Achievements\n1. Life and Achievements\n\n\nHermann Weyl was born on 9 November 1885 in the small town of \nElmshorn near Hamburg. In 1904 he entered G\u00f6ttingen University, \nwhere his teachers included Hilbert, Klein and Minkowski. Weyl was \nparticularly impressed with Hilbert\u2019s lectures on number theory and \nresolved to study everything he had written. Hilbert\u2019s work on \nintegral equations became the focus of Weyl\u2019s (1908) doctoral \ndissertation, written under Hilbert\u2019s direction. In this and in \nsubsequent papers Weyl made important contributions to the theory of \nself-adjoint operators. Virtually all of Weyl\u2019s many publications \nduring his stay in G\u00f6ttingen until 1913 dealt with integral \nequations and their applications.\n\n\nAfter Weyl\u2019s (1910b) habilitation, he became a Privatdozent and was \nthereby entitled to give lectures at the University of \nG\u00f6ttingen. Weyl chose to lecture on Riemann\u2019s theory of \nalgebraic functions during the winter semester of 1911\u201312. \nThese lectures became the basis of Weyl\u2019s (1913) first book Die \nIdee der Riemannschen Fl\u00e4che (The Concept of a Riemann \nSurface). This work, in which function theory, geometry and \ntopology are unified, constitutes the first modern and comprehensive \ntreatment of Riemann surfaces. The work also contains the first \nconstruction of an abstract manifold. Emphasizing that the `points of\nthe manifold\u2019 can be quite arbitrary, Weyl based his definition of a \ngeneral two-dimensional manifold or surface on an extension of the \nneighbourhood axioms that Hilbert (1902) had proposed for the \ndefinition of a plane. The work is indicative of Weyl\u2019s exceptional \ngift for harmoniously uniting into a coherent whole a patchwork of \ndistinct mathematical fields.\n\n\nIn 1913 Weyl was offered, and accepted, a professorship at the \nEidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule\u2014ETH (Swiss Federal \nInstitute of Technology)\u2014in Z\u00fcrich. Weyl\u2019s years in \nZ\u00fcrich were extraordinarily productive and resulted in some of \nhis finest work, especially in the foundations of mathematics and \nphysics. When he arrived in Z\u00fcrich in the fall of 1913, Einstein\nand Grossmann were struggling to overcome a difficulty in their \neffort to provide a coherent mathematical formulation of the general \ntheory of relativity. Like Hilbert, Weyl appreciated the importance \nof a close relationship between mathematics and physics. It was \ntherefore only natural that Weyl should become interested in \nEinstein\u2019s theory and the potential mathematical challenges it might \noffer. Following the outbreak of the First World War, however, in May\n1915 Weyl was called up for military service. But Weyl\u2019s academic \ncareer was interrupted only briefly, since in 1916 he was exempted \nfrom military duties for reasons of health. In the meantime Einstein \nhad accepted an offer from Berlin and had left Z\u00fcrich in 1914. \nEinstein\u2019s departure had weakened the theoretical physics program at \nthe ETH and (as reported by Frei and Stammbach (1992, 26) the \nadministration hoped that Weyl\u2019s presence would alleviate the \nsituation. But Weyl needed no external prompting to work in, and to \nteach, theoretical physics: his interest in the subject in general \nand, above all, in the theory of relativity, gave him more than \nsufficient motivation in that regard. Weyl decided to lecture on the \ngeneral theory of relativity in the summer semester of 1917, and \nthese lectures became the basis of his famous book \nRaum-Zeit-Materie (Space-Time-Matter) of 1918.\n\n\nDuring 1917\u201324, Weyl directed his energies equally to the \ndevelopment of the mathematical and philosophical foundations of \nrelativity theory, and to the broader foundations of mathematics. It \nis in these two areas that his philosophical erudition, nourished \nfrom his youth, manifests itself most clearly. The year 1918, the \nsame year in which Space-Time-Matter appeared, also saw the \npublication of Das Kontinuum (The Continuum), a \nwork in which Weyl constructs a new foundation for mathematical \nanalysis free of what he had come to see as fatal flaws in the \nset-theoretic formulation of Cantor and Dedekind. Soon afterwards \nWeyl embraced Brouwer\u2019s mathematical intuitionism; in the early 1920s\nhe published a number of papers elaborating on and defending the \nintuitionistic standpoint in the foundations of mathematics.\n\n\nIt was also during the first years of the 1920s that Weyl came to \nappreciate the power and utility of group theory, initially in \nconnection with his work on the solution to the Riemann-Helmholtz-Lie\nproblem of space. Weyl analyzed this problem, the \nRaumproblem, in a series of articles and lectures during the\nperiod 1921\u201323. Weyl (1949b, 400) noted that his interest in \nthe philosophical foundations of the general theory of relativity had\nmotivated his analysis of the representations and invariants of the \ncontinuous groups:\nI can say that the wish to understand what really\nis the mathematical substance behind the formal apparatus of\nrelativity theory led me to the study of the representations and\ninvariants of groups; and my experience in this regard is probably not\nunique.\n\n\nThis newly acquired appreciation of group theory led Weyl to what he \nhimself considered his greatest work in mathematics, a general theory\nof the representations and invariants of the classical Lie groups \n(Weyl 1924a, 1924f, 1925, 1926a, 1926b, 1926c). Later Weyl (1939) \nwrote a book, The Classical Groups: Their Invariants and \nRepresentations, in which he returned to the theory of \ninvariants and representations of semisimple Lie groups. In this work\nhe realized his ambition \u201cto derive the decisive results for \nthe most important of these groups by direct algebraic construction, \nin particular for the full group of all non-singular linear \ntransformations and for the orthogonal group.\u201d\n\n\nWeyl applied his work in group theory and his earlier work in \nanalysis and spectral theory to the new theory of quantum mechanics. \nWeyl\u2019s mathematical analysis of the foundations of quantum mechanics \nshowed that regularities in a physical theory are most fruitfully \nunderstood in terms of symmetry groups. Weyl\u2019s (1928) book \nGruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik (Group Theory and \nQuantum Mechanics) deals not only with the theory of quantum \nmechanics but also with relativistic quantum electrodynamics. In this\nwork Weyl also presented a very early analysis of discrete symmetries\nwhich later stimulated Dirac to predict the existence of the positron\nand the antiproton.\n\n\nDuring his years in Z\u00fcrich Weyl received, and turned down, \nnumerous offers of professorships by other \nuniversities\u2014including an invitation in 1923 to become Felix \nKlein\u2019s successor at G\u00f6ttingen. It was only in 1930 that he \nfinally accepted the call to become Hilbert\u2019s successor there. His \nsecond stay in G\u00f6ttingen was to be brief. Repelled by Nazism, \n\u201cdeeply revolted,\u201d as he later wrote, \u201cby the \nshame which this regime had brought to the German name,\u201d he \nleft Germany in 1933 to accept an offer of permanent membership of \nthe newly founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Before \nhis departure for Princeton he published The Open World \n(1932); his tenure there saw the publication of Mind and \nNature (1934), the aforementioned The Classical Groups \n(1939), Algebraic Theory of Numbers (1940), Meromorphic \nFunctions and Analytic Curves (1943), Philosophy of \nMathematics and Natural Science (1949; an enlarged English \nversion of a 1927 work Philosophie der Mathematik und \nNaturwissenschaften), and Symmetry (1952). In 1951 he \nformally retired from the Institute, remaining as an emeritus member \nuntil his death, spending half his time there and half in \nZ\u00fcrich. He died in Z\u00fcrich suddenly, of a heart attack, on 9\nDecember 1955.\n",
