    "main_text": "Physical Theory || Psychology\n2.9 Psychology\n\nOne further topic treated as part of Stoic physics is psychology, the\naccount of the soul. Here the Stoics argue that the soul is corporeal,\ni.e. a body of a certain kind, since it is causally efficacious in a\nway that only bodies are. If the soul were incorporeal, as some\nancient philosophers maintain, then it could not causally interact\nwith the body it animates, as it does e.g. in feeling pain when the\nbody suffers a flesh-wound or in causing the cheeks to blush when it\nfeels shame (Nemesius reporting Cleanthes, 45C). Furthermore, if\nx and y come into contact with each other, then\nx and y must be bodies. But the soul and the body it\nanimates are in constant contact, the Stoics hold, and are later\nseparated from each other at death (Nemesius reporting Chrysippus,\n45D). Therefore the soul is corporeal.\n\nWhat kind of body is the soul? As mentioned above\n (2.3),\n the Stoics identify the soul as pneuma at a certain degree\nof tensility, more rarified than pneuma in the condition of\ntenor (hexis), which is responsible for the coherence of\nsolid objects, and than pneuma in the condition of nature\n(phusis), which regulates vital activities such as nutrition\nand growth (Philo, 47P, Q). Pneuma in the condition of soul\nenables the animal to take in perceptual information from its\nsurroundings, by forming impressions (phantasiai), and to\nmove itself from place to place, by forming impulses (hormai)\n(Origen, 53A).\n\nIn a noteworthy break from both ordinary Greek usage and earlier\nphilosophical theories, the Stoics deny that all living things have\nsouls. Plants have tenor-pneuma and nature-pneuma\nbut not soul, since they do not engage in perception or\nself-locomotion (Philo, 47P; Origen, 53A). Ensouled life is therefore\ndistinguished by the possession of the representational and\nmotivational faculties just mentioned: impression and impulse. In\nnarrowing the conception of the soul from a general principle of life\nto one that refers specifically to these more obviously mental\ncharacteristics, the Stoics take an important step forward in the\nhistory of the philosophy of mind (on which see Annas 1992, Nawar\n2020, and the entry on\n Ancient Theories of Soul).\n\nAmong ensouled creatures, some, such as mature human beings, possess\nreason (logos) and are called \u201crational\u201d\n(logikos), while others, such as dogs or cows, do not and are\ncalled \u201cnon-rational\u201d (alogos). What can the\nrational soul do that the non-rational cannot? Arguably, the most\nimportant difference is the power of assent (sunkatathesis).\nAssent is a faculty found only in the rational soul \u2013 in\nparticular, only in the ruling part or commanding faculty\n(h\u00eagemonikon) of the rational soul (Aetius, 53H;\nIamblichus, 53K) \u2013 which enables us to adopt a critical stance\ntowards our own impressions and pass judgment on them (Origen, 53A).\nRational creatures give assent to the impression that p when\nthey deem p to be true; otherwise, they suspend assent on\np. (\u201cDissenting\u201d, or taking p to be\nfalse, seems to be more precisely analyzed by the Stoics as suspending\nassent on p and then giving assent to not-p.)\nRational creatures are morally and epistemically responsible for our\nacts of assent, but not for the kinds of impressions we form: assent\nis \u201cin our power\u201d or \u201cup to us\u201d in a way that\nreceiving an impression is not (cf. the cylinder and cone analogy\nabove,\n 2.8).\n For the Stoics, there is no exaggeration in the claim that what kind\nof person we are \u2013 whether we are virtuous or not, or\nknowledgeable or not \u2013 depends entirely on our acts of assent.\nThe Stoic conception of assent is therefore of far-reaching\nimportance, both within their own system and for a proper\nunderstanding of later philosophical debates (cataloged in Nawar 2020;\nsee also Frede 2011).\n\nAccording to Stoic psychological theory,\n the outcome of giving assent to the impression that p will\nbe either a doxastic commitment of a certain kind (knowledge,\ncognition, or the opinion that p; see\n 3.7\n below) or a \u201crational impulse\u201d. Impulse, in general, is\nthe psychological event responsible for action, and in rational\ncreatures all impulses are \u201crational impulses\u201d \u2013\n\u201cmovements of thought towards something in the sphere of\naction\u201d (Stobaeus, 53Q). Since assent is necessary and\nsufficient for any rational impulse to be created, the Stoics can be\nseen to endorse a strong form of \u201cmotivational\ncognitivism\u201d: all cases of human action require, and follow\nupon, the agent forming the judgment that the action in question is\nappropriate for them to do (Klein 2015; Graver 2007; Inwood 1985).\nThis account would seem to rule out the possibility of occurrent\nmental conflict, or akrasia, in the form of simultaneously\nconflicting impulses, since it is impossible for the rational mind as\na whole to maintain, at one and the same time, conflicting judgments\n(acts of assent) about what is fitting to do. (Some Stoics seem to\nhave re-analyzed cases of putatively simultaneous akrasia as\ninstead a rapid oscillation between opposing practical judgments:\nPlutarch, 65G.) Stoic psychology and action theory can therefore be\nunderstood as a rejection of the Platonic-Aristotelian approach of\npositing non-rational sources of cognition and motivation in the\nmature human soul, which can potentially oppose the dictates of\nreason, in favor of a reversion to the monistic intellectualism of\nSocrates. Like Socrates, the Stoics are committed to the claim that\nhuman action invariably reflects the assessment of the rational mind\nas a whole concerning what is appropriate to do in the scenario.\n\nGiven this theory, the Stoics construe the skeptical practice of\nglobal suspension of judgment as entailing apraxia, i.e.\ntotal inaction (cf. Plutarch, 69A). For further discussion of the\napraxia charge, see Obdrzalek 2012 and the entries on\n Arcesilaus\n and\n Ancient Skepticism.\n\nAccording to the Stoics, human beings are not born with reason but\nrather acquire it later in life (at age seven, according to Aetius,\n39E). In childhood, then, we utilize a non-rational soul, just like\nnon-rational animals, and thus form impulses without the intervention\nof assent. (On the development of rationality in humans, see Frede\n1994c.) Interestingly, the Stoics also distinguish between rational\nand non-rational impressions, i.e. the impressions formed by\nrational and non-rational creatures (Diogenes Laertius, 39A). Exactly\nhow rational impressions (phantasiai logikai) differ from\ntheir non-rational counterparts remains the subject of lively\nscholarly debate. It is broadly agreed, however, that only rational\nimpressions are created under the direct influence of the\nperceiver\u2019s concepts (ennoiai; cf. Galen, 53V), and\nthat only rational impressions express propositions\n(axi\u00f4mata, one kind of sayable or lekton) (see\nFrede 1983, 1994c; Brittain 2002; Shogry 2019; for alternative views,\nsee Caston forthcoming, and Sorabji 1990).\n",
