    "main_text": "Truth Conduciveness: the Analysis Debate\n7. Truth Conduciveness: the Analysis Debate\n\nPeter Klein and Ted Warfield\u2019s 1994 paper in Analysis\ninitiated a lively and instructive debate on the relationship between\ncoherence and probability (e.g., Klein and Warfield 1994 and 1996,\nMerricks 1995, Shogenji 1999, Cross 1999, Akiba 2000, Olsson 2001,\nFitelson 2003 and Siebel 2004). According to Klein and Warfield, just\nbecause one set of beliefs is more coherent than another set, this\ndoes not mean that the first set is more likely to be true. On the\ncontrary, a higher degree of coherence can, so they claimed, be\nassociated with a lower probability of the whole set. The idea behind\ntheir reasoning is simple: We can often raise the coherence of an\ninformational set by adding more information that explains the\ninformation already in the set. But as more genuinely new information\nis added, the probability that all the elements of the set are true is\ncorrespondingly diminished. This, Klein and Warfield wrote, follows\nfrom the well-known inverse relationship between probability and\ninformational content. They concluded that coherence is not truth\nconducive.\n\nMuch in the spirit of C. I. Lewis, Klein and Warfield illustrated\ntheir argument referring to a detective story (the so-called\n\u201cDunnit example\u201d). It turns out that this example is\nunnecessarily complex and that the main point can be illustrated by\nreference to a simpler case (borrowed from computer science where it\nis used to exemplify the concept of non-monotonic inference). Suppose\nthat you are told by one source, Jane, that Tweety is a bird and by\nanother source, Carl, that Tweety cannot fly. The resulting\ninformation set \\(S = \\langle\\)\u201cTweety is a bird\u201d,\n\u201cTweety cannot fly\u201d\\(\\rangle\\) is not particularly coherent\nfrom an intuitive standpoint. Nor is it coherent from the point of\nview of Lewis\u2019s definition: assuming one of the items true decreases\nthe probability of the other. At this point, it would be reasonable to\nconjecture that either Jane or Carl is not telling the truth. However,\nupon consulting a further source, Rick, we receive the information\nthat Tweety is a penguin. The new set \\(S' = \\langle\\)\u201cTweety is a bird\u201d, \u201cTweety cannot fly\u201d,\n\u201cTweety is a penguin\u201d\\(\\rangle\\) is surely more coherent than\n\\(S\\). In explaining the previous anomaly, the information supplied\nby Rick contributes to the explanatory coherence of the set.\n\nThe new enlarged set \\(S'\\) is more coherent than the\noriginal smaller set \\(S\\). And yet \\(S\\), being less\ninformative, is more probable than \\(S'\\): the conjunction of\nall the propositions in \\(S\\) is more probable than the conjunction\nof all the propositions in \\(S'\\). Hence, more coherence does\nnot necessarily imply higher likelihood of truth in the sense of\nhigher joint probability. Klein and Warfield seem to be right:\ncoherence is not truth conducive.\n\nBut, as will soon be clear, this conclusion is premature. As a\npreliminary, let us state Klein and Warfield\u2019s argument more formally\nusing the following abbreviations:\n\n\\(A_1 =\\)\u201cTweety is a bird.\u201d\n\\(A_2 =\\)\u201cTweety cannot fly.\u201d\n\\(A_3 =\\)\u201cTweety is a penguin.\u201d\n\n\nThe first information set \\(S\\) consists of \\(A_1\\)\nand \\(A_2\\). The second, more coherent set\n\\(S'\\) contains, in addition, \\(A_3\\). We let\n\\(C\\) denote the degree of coherence, intuitively understood. What\nwe have then is:\n\n\\[\nC(A_1,A_2) \\lt C(A_1,A_2,A_3).\n\\]\n\n\nAs we saw, due to the greater informational content of the larger set,\nits probability is lower than that of the smaller set:\n\n\\[\nP(A_1,A_2,A_3) \\lt P(A_1,A_2).\n\\]\n\n\nYet behind this seemingly impeccable piece of reasoning lurks a\nserious difficulty. As we saw, it is part of the example that we are\nsupposed to know also that Jane reports that Tweety is a\nbird, that Carl reports that Tweety cannot fly and that\nRick reports that Tweety is a penguin. Let:\n\n\\(E_1 =\\)\u201cJane reports that Tweety is a bird\u201d\n\\(E_2 =\\)\u201cCarl reports that Tweety cannot fly\u201d\n\\(E_3 =\\)\u201cRick reports that Tweety is a penguin\u201d\n\n\nThe well-known principle of total evidence now dictates that all\nrelevant evidence should be taken into consideration when computing\nprobabilities. Since it cannot be excluded at the outset that the\nevidence represented by\n\\(E_1\\)\u2013\\(E_3\\) may be relevant to the\nprobability of the information sets \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\), the\nprobability of the smaller set is not\n\\(P(A_1,A_2)\\) but rather\n\\(P(A_1,A_2 \\mid E_1,E_2)\\). Similarly, the probability\nof the larger set is not\n\\(P(A_1,A_2,A_3)\\)\nbut rather\n\\(P(A_1,A_2,A_3 \n\\mid E_1, E_2,\nE_3)\\).\n\nBovens and Olsson (2002) raised the question whether, given this\nrevised understanding of the probability of a set of reported\npropositions, it would still follow that extended sets are no more\nprobable than the sets they extend. Referring to our Tweety example,\nwould it still hold that\n\n\\[\nP(A_1,A_2,A_3 \\mid E_1,E_2,E_3) \\lt P(A_1,A_2 \\mid E_1,E_2)?\n\\]\n\n\nBovens and Olsson demonstrated that the answer to the general question\nis in the negative by giving an example of a more coherent extended\nset that is also more probable, on the revised understanding of what\nthis means, than the original smaller set. Klein and Warfield\u2019s\nreasoning is based on an problematic understanding of the joint\nprobability of a set of reported propositions. In the end, they have\nnot shown that coherence is not truth conducive. \n\nLet us say that a measure \\(C\\) of coherence is propositionally\ntruth conducive if and only if the following holds: \n\nif \n \\(C(A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n) \\gt C(B_1 ,\\ldots ,B_m)\\), then\n\n \\(P(A_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge A_n) \\gt P(B_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge B_m)\\).\n\n\n\nOne lesson emerging from the Analysis debate is\nthat this way of construing truth conduciveness should be replaced by\na notion of truth conduciveness where the relevant probabilities take\nall relevant evidence into account, whatever that evidence may be\n(beliefs, testimonies etc.). For example, a coherence measure \\(C\\)\nis doxastically truth conducive (for a subject \\(S)\\) if\nand only if:\n\nif \\(C(A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n) \\gt C(B_1 ,\\ldots ,B_m)\\), then \n\\(P(A_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge A_n \\mid \\mathrm{Bel}_S A_1,\\ldots,\\mathrm{Bel}_{S}A_n)\n\\gt\\) \\(P(B_1\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge B_m \\mid \\mathrm{Bel}_S B_1,\\ldots,\\mathrm{Bel}_{S}B_m)\\),\n\n\nwhere \\(\\mathrm{Bel}_S A\\) abbreviates \u201c\\(S\\) believes\nthat \\(A\\)\u201d. In other words, a measure of coherence is\ndoxastically truth conducive just in case a more coherent set of\nbelieved propositions is jointly more probable than a less\ncoherent set of believed propositions. This the how we will\nunderstand the probability (likelihood of truth) of a set in the\nfollowing.\n",
