Contemporary Ethical Concerns about Social Networking Services\n\nWhile early SNS scholarship in the social and natural sciences tended\nto focus on SNS impact on users\u2019 psychosocial markers of\nhappiness, well-being, psychosocial adjustment, social capital, or\nfeelings of life satisfaction, philosophical concerns about social\nnetworking and ethics have generally centered on topics less amenable\nto empirical measurement (e.g., privacy, identity, friendship, the\ngood life and democratic freedom). More so than \u2018social\ncapital\u2019 or feelings of \u2018life satisfaction,\u2019 these\ntopics are closely tied to traditional concerns of ethical theory\n(e.g., virtues, rights, duties, motivations and consequences). These\ntopics are also tightly linked to the novel features and distinctive\nfunctionalities of SNS, more so than some other issues of interest in\ncomputer and information ethics that relate to more general Internet\nfunctionalities (for example, issues of copyright and intellectual\nproperty).\n\nDespite the methodological challenges of applying philosophical theory\nto rapidly shifting empirical patterns of SNS influence, philosophical\nexplorations of the ethics of SNS have continued in recent years to\nmove away from Borgmann and Dreyfus\u2019 transcendental-existential\nconcerns about the Internet, to the empirically-driven space of\napplied technology ethics. Research in this space explores three\ninterlinked and loosely overlapping kinds of ethical phenomena:\n\ndirect ethical impacts of social networking activity\nitself (just or unjust, harmful or beneficial) on participants as well\nas third parties and institutions;\nindirect ethical impacts on society of social networking\nactivity, caused by the aggregate behavior of users, platform\nproviders and/or their agents in complex interactions between these\nand other social actors and forces;\nstructural impacts of SNS on the ethical shape of\nsociety, especially those driven by the dominant surveillant and\nextractivist value orientations that sustain social networking\nplatforms and culture.\n\n\nMost research in the field, however, remains topic- and\ndomain-driven\u2014exploring a given potential harm or\ndomain-specific ethical dilemma that arises from direct, indirect, or\nstructural effects of SNS, or more often, in combination. Sections\n3.1\u20133.5 outline the most widely discussed of contemporary\nSNS\u2019 ethical challenges.\n",
