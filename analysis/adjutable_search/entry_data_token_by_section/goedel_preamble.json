    "main_text": "\n\nKurt Friedrich G\u00f6del (b. 1906, d. 1978) was one of the principal\nfounders of the modern, metamathematical era in mathematical logic. He\nis widely known for his Incompleteness Theorems, which are among the\nhandful of landmark theorems in twentieth century mathematics, but his\nwork touched every field of mathematical logic, if it was not in most\ncases their original stimulus. In his philosophical work G\u00f6del\nformulated and defended mathematical Platonism, the view that\nmathematics is a descriptive science, or alternatively the view that\nthe concept of mathematical truth is objective. On the basis of that\nviewpoint he laid the foundation for the program of conceptual\nanalysis within set theory (see below). He adhered to Hilbert\u2019s\n\u201coriginal rationalistic conception\u201d in mathematics (as he\ncalled\n it);[1]\n and he was prophetic in anticipating and emphasizing the importance\nof large cardinals in set theory before their importance became\nclear.\n",
