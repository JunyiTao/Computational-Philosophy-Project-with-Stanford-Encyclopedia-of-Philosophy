    "main_text": "Writings\n2. Writings\n\nThe extant writings of Adam Wodeham include: his two commentaries on\nthe Sentences of Peter Lombard (the Lectura and the\nOrdinatio); a prologue to William of Ockham\u2019s Summa\nlogicae; a short quaestio on the continuum; a\nlonger Tractatus de indivisibilibus; the Tractatus\nalphabeticus, and perhaps the 51st chapter of part I\nof Ockham\u2019s Summa logicae and the last question of book\nIV of the same author\u2019s Reportatio.\n\nAdam Wodeham\u2019s most significant philosophical and theological\nworks are his two commentaries on the Sentences. The\nLectura (c. 1320s) is the earlier of the two works and is a\nloose commentary on the first 26 distinctions of the first book of the\nLombard\u2019s Sentences. The single manuscript of the\nLectura (Cambridge, Gonville and Caius, Ms 281 (674), ff.\n105\u2013250) has been published in a modern critical edition\n(G\u00e1l and Wood 1990). The Ordinatio (1332\u201334),\nWodeham\u2019s most mature extant work, is a more expansive\ncommentary, treating all four books of the Lombard\u2019s\nSentences and extensively re-writing and re-organizing the\nfirst 26 distinctions of the first book. A critical edition of the\nOrdinatio is available at the\n Scholastic Commentaries and Texts Archive.\n\nThe shorter works of Wodeham comprise several collaborations with his\nteacher William of Ockham. These include Wodeham\u2019s brief\nintroduction to Ockham\u2019s Summa logicae, which has been\nedited in the critical edition. Further, Courtenay argues that Wodeham\nis probably the disciple who wrote the 51st chapter of part\nI of Ockham\u2019s Summa logicae (Courtenay 1978, 34). Both\nof these short works were written between 1320 and 1324, as Wodeham\ncollaborated with the Venerable Inceptor. Finally, Gedeon G\u00e1l\nalso noted that in one of the manuscripts of Ockham\u2019s\nReportatio (Milan, Ambros. 281 inf., fol. 69rb) on\nbook IV of the Sentences, a marginal notation attributes the\nfinal question of the work to Wodeham (Courtenay 1978, 34, fn.\n61).\n\nWodeham\u2019s shorter works also include two tracts on the\ncontinuum written against the indivisibilists or atomists and\nthe Tractatus alphabeticus. The shorter work on the\ncontinuum (Murdoch and Synan 1966, 212\u2013288), consisting\nof a single quaestio, is an early redaction of the longer\nwork, the Tractatus de indivisibilibus (Wood 1988). Both of\nthe works were probably written between 1323 and 1331 (Wood 1998, 16).\nThe Tractatus alphabeticus considers the latitude of forms\nand was written around 1333 (Wood 374).\n\nFinally, the lost works of Adam Wodeham include Biblical commentaries\non the Canticum canticorum and the first book of\nEcclesiasticus. And, based on historical and textual\nevidence, it is generally held that Wodeham wrote a set of\nDeterminationes, some of which were probably included in the\nTractatus de indivisibilibus.\n",
