    "main_text": "Category Theory\n6. Category Theory\n\n\n           \nIn speaking of beings which depend upon substance for their existence,\nAristotle implicitly appeals to a foundational philosophical commitment\nwhich appears early in his thought and remains stable throughout his\nentire philosophical career: his theory of categories. In what is\nusually regarded as an early work, The Categories, Aristotle\nrather abruptly announces:\n\n\nOf things said without combination, each signifies either: (i) a\nsubstance (ousia); (ii) a quantity; (iii) a quality; (iv) a\nrelative; (v) where; (vi) when; (vii) being in a position; (viii)\nhaving; (ix) acting upon; or (x) a being affected. (Cat.\n1b25\u201327)\n\n\nAristotle does little to frame his theory of categories, offering no\nexplicit derivation of it, nor even specifying overtly what his theory\nof categories categorizes. If librarians categorize books and\nbotanists categorize plants, then what does the philosophical category\ntheorist categorize?  \n\n\n           \nAristotle does not say explicitly, but his examples make reasonably\nclear that he means to categorize the basic kinds of beings there may\nbe. If we again take some clues from linguistic data, without\ninferring that the ultimate objects of categorization are themselves\nlinguistic, we can contrast things said \u201cwith\ncombination\u201d:\n\nMan runs.\n\n\n\nwith things said \u2018without combination\u2019:\n\nMan\nRuns\n\n\n\n\u2018Man runs\u2019 is truth-evaluable, whereas neither \n\u2018man\u2019 nor \u2018runs\u2019 is. Aristotle says that\nthings of this sort signify entities, evidently\nextra-linguistic entities, which are thus, correlatively, in the first\ncase sufficiently complex to be what makes the sentence \u2018Man\nruns\u2019 true, that is a man running, and in the second,\nitems below the level of truth-making, so, e.g., an entity a man,\ntaken by itself, and an action running, taken by itself. \nIf that is correct, the entities categorized by the categories are the\nsorts of basic beings that fall below the level of truth-makers, or\nfacts. Such beings evidently contribute, so to speak, to the\nfacticity of facts, just as, in their linguistic analogues, nouns and\nverbs, things said \u2018without combination\u2019, contribute to the\ntruth-evaluability of simple assertions. The constituents of\nfacts contribute to facts as the semantically relevant parts of a\nproposition contribute to its having the truth conditions it has. \nThus, the items categorized in Aristotle\u2019s categories are the\nconstituents of facts. If it is a fact that Socrates is\npale, then the basic beings in view are Socrates and\nbeing pale.   In Aristotle\u2019s terms, the first\nis a substance and the second is a quality. \n\n\nImportantly, these beings may be basic without being\nabsolutely simple. After all, Socrates is made up of all\nmanner of parts\u2014arms and legs, organs and bones, molecules and\natoms, and so on down. As a useful linguistic analogue, we may\nconsider phonemes, which are basic, relative to the morphemes\nof a linguistic theory, and yet also complex, since they are made up of\nsimpler sound components, which are irrelevant from the\nlinguist\u2019s point of view because of their lying beneath the level\nof semantic relevance. \n\n\n           \nThe theory of categories in total recognizes ten sorts of\nextra-linguistic basic beings:\n\n\nCategory\nIllustration\n\n\nSubstance\nman, horse\n\n\nQuality\nwhite, grammatical\n\n\nQuantity\ntwo-feet long\n\n\nRelative\ndouble, slave\n\n\nPlace\nin the market\n\n\nTime\nyesterday, tomorrow\n\n\nPosition\nlying, sitting\n\n\nHaving\nhas shoes on\n\n\nActing Upon\ncutting, burning\n\n\nBeing Affected\nbeing cut, being burnt\n\n\n\n\nAlthough he does not say so overtly in the Categories,\nAristotle evidently presumes that these ten categories of being are\nboth exhaustive and irreducible, so that while there are no other\nbasic beings, it is not possible to eliminate any one of these\ncategories in favor of another.\n\n\n           \nBoth claims have come in for criticism, and each surely\n requires\n defense.[15]\nAristotle offers neither conviction a defense in his\nCategories. Nor, indeed, does he offer any principled\ngrounding for just these categories of being, a circumstance which has\nleft him open to further criticism from later philosophers, including\nfamously Kant who, after lauding Aristotle for coming up with the idea\nof category theory, proceeds to excoriate him for selecting his\nparticular categories on no principled basis whatsoever. Kant\nalleges that Aristotle picked his categories of being just as he\nhappened to stumble upon them in his reveries (Critique of Pure\nReason, A81/B107).   According to Kant, then,\nAristotle\u2019s categories are ungrounded. \nPhilosophers and scholars both before and after Kant have sought to\nprovide the needed grounding, whereas Aristotle himself mainly tends to\njustify the theory of categories by putting it to work in his various\nphilosophical investigations.\n\n\n           \nWe have already implicitly encountered in passing two of\nAristotle\u2019s appeals to category theory: (i) in his approach to\ntime, which he comes to treat as a non-substantial being; and (ii) in his\ncommitment to the core-dependent homonymy of being, which introduces\nsome rather more contentious considerations. These may be\nrevisited briefly to illustrate how Aristotle thinks that his doctrine\nof categories provides philosophical guidance where it is most\nneeded.\n\n\nThinking first of time and its various puzzles, or aporiai,\nwe saw that Aristotle poses a simple question: does time exist? \nHe answers this question in the affirmative, but only because in the\nend he treats it as a categorically circumscribed question.  \nHe claims that \u2018time is the measure of motion with respect to the\nbefore and after\u2019 (Phys. 219b1\u20132).   By\noffering this definition, Aristotle is able to advance the judgment\nthat time does exist, because it is an entity in the category of\nquantity: time is to motion or change as length is to a line. \nTime thus exists, but like all items in any non-substance category, it\nexists in a dependent sort of way. Just as if there were no lines\nthere would be no length, so if there were no change there would be no\ntime. Now, this feature of Aristotle\u2019s theory of time has\noccasioned both critical and favorable\n reactions.[16] \n In the present context,\nhowever, it is important only that it serves to demonstrate how\nAristotle handles questions of existence: they are, at root, questions\nabout category membership. A question as to whether, e.g.,\nuniversals or places or relations exist, is ultimately, for Aristotle,\nalso a question concerning their category of being, if any.\n\n\n           \nAs time is a dependent entity in Aristotle\u2019s theory, so too are\nall entities in categories outside of substance. This helps\nexplain why Aristotle thinks it appropriate to deploy his apparatus of\ncore-dependent homonymy in the case of being. If we ask\nwhether qualities or quantities exist, Aristotle will answer in the\naffirmative, but then point out also that as dependent entities they do\nnot exist in the independent manner of substances. Thus, even in\nthe relatively rarified case of being, the theory of\ncategories provides a reason for uncovering core-dependent\nhomonymy. Since all other categories of being depend upon\nsubstance, it should be the case that an analysis of any one of them\nwill ultimately make asymmetrical reference to substance. Aristotle\ncontends in his Categories, relying on a distinction that\ntracks essential (said-of) and accidental (in)\npredication, that:\n\n\nAll other things are either said-of primary\nsubstances, which are their subjects, or are in them as\nsubjects. Hence, if there were no primary substances, it would be\nimpossible for anything else to exist. (Cat. 2b5\u20136)\n \n\n\nIf this is so, then, Aristotle infers, all the non-substance\ncategories rely upon substance as the core of their being. So, he\nconcludes, being qualifies as a case of core-dependent homonymy.\n\n\n           \nNow, one may challenge Aristotle\u2019s contentions here, first by\nquerying whether he has established the non-univocity of being\nbefore proceeding to argue for its core-dependence. Be that as it\nmay, if we allow its non-univocity, then, according to Aristotle, the\napparatus of the categories provides ample reason to conclude that\nbeing qualifies as a philosophically significant instance of\ncore-dependent homonymy.\n\n\n           \nIn this way, Aristotle\u2019s philosophy of being and substance, like\nmuch else in his philosophy, relies upon an antecedent commitment to\nhis theory of categories.   Indeed, the theory of categories\nspans his entire career and serves as a kind of scaffolding for much of\nhis philosophical theorizing, ranging from metaphysics and philosophy\nof nature to psychology and value theory. \n\n\n           \nFor this reason, questions regarding the ultimate tenability of\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine of categories take on a special urgency for\nevaluating much of his philosophy. \n\n\nFor more detail on the theory of categories and its grounding,\n see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s Categories.\n",
