Some Major Figures\u2019 Views on the Morality of Revolution\n\nNo attempt can be made here to conduct a survey of views on revolution\nacross the history of Western Philosophy, much less one that\nencompasses other traditions. Instead, it must suffice to say that the\ntypical attitude toward revolution of major figures in the Western\ntradition prior to the modern period was to condemn it or to\nacknowledge its moral permissibility only in very narrow circumstances\n(Morkevicius 2014). Augustine (City of God) and Aquinas\n(Summa theologiae), for example, both condemn rebellion and\nhence revolution, unambiguously urging obedience to the powers that\nbe. Su\u00e1rez (1609) held that only \u201clesser\nmagistrates\u201d had the authority to try to overthrow an existing\ngovernment, with the implication that revolution by those who do not\nalready occupy official roles is never justified. Hobbes (1651),\nexplicitly denied that revolution could ever be justified, holding\ninstead that a subject could only rightly resist government authority\nas a matter of self-defense and then only when the perpetration of\nlethal harm against her was imminent.\n\nPerhaps the most famous condemnation of revolutions comes from\nImmanuel Kant. According to Kant, revolution is never justified,\nregardless of the extent to which political power is abused. He\nwrites: \u201cThe reason a people has a duty to put up with even what\nis held to be an unbearable abuse of supreme authority is that its\nresistance to the highest legislator can never be regarded as other\nthan contrary to law, and indeed as abolishing the entire legal\nconstitution\u201d (Ak 6:320). Kant\u2019s unqualified rejection of\nthe possibility of justified revolution is based in his understanding\nof individual rights as inherently relational. For Kant, the Universal\nPrinciple of Right dictates that constraints on individual freedom are\nto be such that they are compatible with the freedom of all under\nuniversal law (Ak 6:230\u20131). Rights are constituted by claims\nconcerning the conduct of others, but individuals are not in a\nposition to unilaterally enforce those claims. Individual enforcement\nof a rights claim amounts to an individual imposing his will and\ninterpretation of the situation on another, and this kind of\nimposition is impermissible as a basic matter of justice.\nConsequently, a juridical, omnilateral will that is not party to\nrights relations is necessary to enforce rights claims in a way that\nis compatible with the Universal Principle of Right. The state is such\na will. Hence, submission to the state is a necessary condition of\nachieving the juridical conditions of mutual freedom that are required\non grounds of the Universal Principle of Right (for much more detailed\ndiscussions, see: Hill 2002, Korsgaard 2008, Flikschuh 2008).\nRevolution is never justified because it lacks rightful authority.\n\nThe anti-revolutionary arguments just surveyed can be summarized in\nthe following terms. First is the Undue Risk Argument, according to\nwhich the prospect of violent anarchy that follows an attempted\nrevolution is so great that it defeats any other reasons that purport\nto justify political revolution. Second is the Conceptual Argument\noffered by Kant, according to which acts that instigate revolution can\nnever satisfy the requirement of rightful authority, and so are\nnecessarily unjustified.\n\nA number of figures in the history of political thought have opposed\nsuch anti-revolutionary positions. The monarchomachs in late\n16th century France argued that their monarchy was\nunjustified and advocated for revolution and tyrannicide. Francois\nHotman defended this claim by arguing that the French constitution was\nfundamentally based in an assembly of the nation, and the author of\nVindicie contra Tyrannos, publishing under the pseudonym\nStephanus Junius Brutus, argued that subjects are never bound to obey\na prince that oversteps God\u2019s law and that subjects are entitled\nto resist a King that deviates from his divine duties (for an overview\nof the monarchomachs, see Dunning 1904). In his work De Jure Regni\napud Scotos, the Scottish thinker George Buchanan argues for an\nearly conception of popular sovereignty according to which the people\nare entitled to resist and punish tyrants (Macmillan 2016 [1906]\nprovides a comprehensive biography of Buchanan\u2019s life and\nsummary of his political thought).\n\nThe most prominent defense of revolution in the liberal tradition was\noffered by John Locke, according to which revolution is both justified\nand permissible when the state breaches its duty to protect the\nnatural rights of persons (1689, chapter XIX). On Locke\u2019s social\ncontract theory, the state is formed to protect individual rights and\nresolve disputes between persons concerning their rights. The state\nthus acts as a trustee of the rights of individuals, and violation of\nthose rights amounts to a breach of trust (Simmons 1993, pp.\n157\u20138). If the trust is breached, the rights entrusted to the\nstate are returned to civil society, members of which are then\nentitled to defend against violations of those rights through the use\nof force (Locke 1689, section 227, on rights returning to civil\nsociety see Simmons 1993, pp. 171\u20132). We can thus summarize the\ncore of Locke\u2019s view on revolution in terms of the Self-Defense\nArgument, according to which revolution is justified against some\nstate S when S breaches its fiduciary obligation to protect individual\nnatural rights, then the authority to protect these rights returns to\nthe people (for a discussion contrasting Kant\u2019s and\nLocke\u2019s views of revolution, see Flikschuh 2008).\n\nLocke took a more favorable stance toward revolution than Hobbes or\nhis medieval predecessors because he did not believe that the risks of\nphysical insecurity attendant upon the destruction of an existing\ngovernment were as high as those thinkers did. That more optimistic\nview as grounded, in turn, in his belief that the destruction of the\npolitical order need not entail the destruction of society\u2014that\nis, of social practices and habits that effectively control the most\nserious forms of violence (Simmons 1993, p. 171). It is a mistake,\nhowever, to conclude either that Hobbes was right and Locke was wrong\nor vice versa about the consequences for physical security of\nthe destruction of government. A more reasonable view is that the\nrisks of the destruction of government and hence of revolution vary,\ndepending upon the circumstances. If that is so, and if the\njustifiability of revolution depends even in part on the severity of\nthe risks of physical insecurity it involves, then it appears that the\ncontent of a moral theory of revolution must be shaped by empirical\nconsiderations. We return to this point in the subsequent section,\nwhere we introduce a distinction between the different kinds of social\ncontexts within which revolutions take place.\n\nWhereas liberal political philosophers have tended to frame the\njustification for revolution in terms of natural rights and justice,\nrevolution in the Marxist tradition is understood quite differently.\nThere is one strain of Marx interpretation according to which he\nrejects rights-talk altogether, either in favor of the discourse of\nconflicting interests or in favor of the vocabulary of\nself-realization or mankind\u2019s overcoming of alienation from its\n\u201cspecies being\u201d (Buchanan 1982). On this interpretation,\nMarx held that the very concept of rights is an ideological construct\nthat is fostered by and in turn reinforces the egoistic psychology of\nbourgeois society and will be discarded once the transition to\ndeveloped communist society occurs. If the very concept of rights is\nthus both tainted and fated for obsolescence, then the question arises\nas to how else the justification for proletarian revolution might be\nframed (Finlay 2006). One answer that is consistent at least with the\nearly writings of Marx is that proletarian revolution is needed to\ndestroy the conditions of alienation and create the conditions for the\nfull realization of man\u2019s nature as a creative, communal being,\nthe sort of being who will, through processes of scientifically\ninformed collective decision-making, bring the natural and social\nworld fully under deliberate human control for the good of all\n(Economic & Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, in\nMER: 66\u2013125).\n\nEven if Marx thought that successful revolution could be correctly\ndescribed as the overcoming of alienation or more positively as the\nrealization of human \u201cspecies being\u201d, it is doubtful that\nhe thought that proletarian revolution needed to be justified\nin this or any other way. There is, after all, a Marx who derides\n\u201cmoralistic\u201d socialists and who seems to hold that\nsuccessful proletarian revolution is a matter of the historically\ninevitable realization of the common interests of the proletariat, and\nthat the revolution will be effectively motivated by those interests,\nnot by a commitment to any moral principle (On the Division of\nLabor in Production in MER: 683\u2013717). Such\nan interpretation fits well with Marx\u2019s understanding of his\ntheory of history as scientific and realistic. According to this\naccount, the question of whether revolution is justified is idle; it\nwill occur, because the revolution in the mode of production that\nmarks the transition from capitalism to communism will produce a\nfundamental transformation of all social relationships that will carry\nhuman beings beyond the state and beyond politics (Critique of the\nGotha Programme, Part IV, 1875 in MER:\n525\u2013541). On this reading, Marx does not offer a justification\nof revolution so much as he offers an explanation for why a certain\nkind of revolution must (on his view) occur (for a discussion\ncomparing Kant and Marx\u2019s views that argues against the\namoralist reading of Marx, see Ypi 2014)\n\nBy way of summary and as a broad generalization, it is fair to say\nthat at least since the time of Locke, the dominant view on revolution\nin Western Political Philosophy, both in the Liberal and Marxist\ntraditions, and perhaps in popular political culture as well, has been\nconsiderably more permissive than that of Hobbes and Kant and their\nmedieval predecessors. For the remainder of this entry, we will assess\nvarious morally relevant features of revolutions, drawing on insights\ndeveloped in contemporary just war theory.\n",
