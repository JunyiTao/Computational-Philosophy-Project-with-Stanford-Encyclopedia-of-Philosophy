    "main_text": "Repatriation || Arguments Based on Reparations\n3.2 Arguments Based on Reparations\n\nInstead of resting claims for repatriation on appeals to cultural\nproperty, one might instead argue that repatriation is required as a\ncomponent of reparations for historical injustices: in particular, for\nthe unjust acquisition of cultural property, and for the unjust\ncampaigns of colonial occupation and genocide in which such\nacquisitions were embedded. Because many repatriation claims concern\nobjects that changed hands during previous generations, reparations\nfor unjust acquisition or the unjust treatment of the former owners\ncan seem to provide a suitable framework for justifying repatriation.\nMoreover, because humans remains are typically not considered subject\nto private ownership (Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 464), reparations might be\nthought to offer a more fitting framework for repatriation cases\nconcerning remains than a cultural property framework. Interestingly,\nhowever, many of the objections that can be raised against the\ncultural property approach apply to the reparations approach as well.\nThis section will focus only on reparative issues that are especially\npertinent to repatriation (for further discussion of reparations, see\nentries on\n reconciliation,\n intergenerational justice, and\n black reparations).\n For a general argumentative framework for repatriation as reparations\nto be successful, it needs to demonstrate that some entity has an\nobligation to correct an historical injustice, that reparations are an\nappropriate form of correction, and that repatriation is an\nappropriate means of reparations (Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 463).\n3.2.1 Unjust acquisition\n\nIt appears that the first step in a reparative argument will be to\nestablish that an object was unjustly acquired. Failure to do so would\nseem to undermine the reparative basis for a repatriation claim of\nsuch an object: if an object was not unjustly acquired, then a\nrepatriation claim based on the reparation of an historical injustice\ndoes not appear to apply (Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 464). This might be\nthought of as an additional burden faced in reparation-based\nrepatriation cases in particular: more general arguments for\nreparation often involve compensation as opposed to restitution (Perez\n2011; though notably not in the case of land claims (Simmons 1995)),\nsince what is being compensated for is typically pain, suffering, and\nloss of economic opportunity. However, one might alternatively think\nthat repatriation could be justified as part of a reparative\nobligation to a cultural group even if there is no justifiable claim\nto ownership of a particular object, but simply as a form of\ncompensation for historical injustices against the group in general,\nespecially given the inextricable relationship between these broader\ninjustice and the more specific case of cultural property acquisition\n(Harding 1997: 739; Ypi 2013: 187; Thompson 2013: 90\u201391; Ypi\n2017; Matthes 2017: 946\u2013950). If this is correct, then the\nreparative approach has an important advantage over appeals to\ncultural property: it can avoid the problem of establishing unjust\nacquisition of a particular object.\n3.2.2 \u201cLegitimate descendants\u201d and cultural continuity\n\nA successful case for repatriation as reparations requires a\njustifiable account of to whom an object should be returned. In the\ncontext of reparations, this requires identifying the\n\u201clegitimate descendants\u201d of the original victims of the\npast injustice of wrongful acquisition (Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 465;\ndrawing on Boxill 2003). Although repatriation cases sometimes involve\nindividuals or families (as in cases concerning the return of items\nseized by the Nazis), most repatriation claims addressed in the\nliterature concern wrongs against, and return to, nations or cultural\ngroups. Identifying the legitimate descendants of the original victims\nmight depend on tracing a causal chain of harms from the original\nvictims (Boxill\u2019s \u201charm argument\u201d) or based on the\ninheritance of compensation that was owed but never made\n(Boxill\u2019s \u201cinheritance argument\u201d). One route to\nemploying the inheritance argument in this context is to appeal to\nbonds of common culture in order to identify the relevant inheritors\n(Bj\u00f6rnberg 2014: 466). However, this approach raises the same\ncultural group problems of cultural continuity\n (2.3)\n and cultural essentialism\n (4.2.3)\n that confront other topics in heritage ethics. Using the harm\nargument, on the other hand, or an alternative application of the\ninheritance argument, would require appeal to some variety of\ncontinuity, but this would not necessarily be equivalent to cultural\ncontinuity (Matthes 2017: 937). For instance, one might be able to\ntrace a chain of harms between an original victim group and a later\ngroup, even if the later group has undergone radical cultural\nchanges.\n3.2.3 Value for humanity\n\nEven if the rightful recipients in repatriation claims can be\nestablished, a further objection to reparation-based repatriation may\nstill be pressed. This is the objection that repatriation is not\njustified all things considered because countervailing considerations\n(Young 2007: 122), particularly concerning the value of retaining\nobjects in public and/or academic settings, outweigh the reasons in\nfavor of it (Thompson 2004). This kind of objection often appeals to\nthe purportedly universal value of cultural heritage discussed in\n section 2.2.\n In the case of artifacts, this may be construed as an aesthetic,\ncultural, or historical value that renders such objects inherently\npublic (Lindsay 2012). Assuming, for instance, that encyclopedic\nmuseums have an important value, some worry that repatriation would\nlead to the gutting of these collections, though whether or not such a\nworry is justified, particularly on the basis of slippery slope\narguments, remains questionable (Joyce 2003). In the case of human\nremains, this universal value claim often takes the form of scientific\nvalue, as in the much-discussed dispute over the \u201cThe Ancient\nOne\u201d (or \u201cKennewick Man\u201d; Thompson 2013: 95;\nWhittaker 1997; Brown 2003; TallBear 2013). Disputes over human\nremains, particularly of indigenous peoples, are thus often framed in\nterms of a conflict between religion and science, where it is often\nthought that the former should give way to the latter (Thompson 2013:\n95\u20136). However, an alternative framing of the dispute notes that\nburials possess a wide range of legal protections, and so Native\nAmerican repatriation claims are not based so much on religious\ngrounds as on pursuit of equality of treatment (Harding 1997: 765).\nOne might also argue that precisely because many museums are committed\nto serving as trustees of universally valuable collections for all\nhumankind, they should be more concerned with achieving a just\ndistribution of such cultural resources, in contrast with the\nretentionist position that they often take such commitments to support\n(Thompson 2004: 558\u2013559; Matthes 2017).\n4. Cultural Appropriation\n4.1 What is Cultural Appropriation?\n\nCultural appropriation is generally understood as the taking or use of\nthe cultural products of \u201ccultural insiders\u201d by\n\u201ccultural outsiders\u201d (Young 2005: 136). Cultural products\ncan range widely, including stories, styles, motifs, artifacts,\nartworks, traditional knowledge, as well as representations of the\nmembers of a particular culture (Young 2008: 4; 2005: 136; Scafidi\n2005). Questions about cultural appropriation thus often arise in a\nbroad array of artistic contexts (in particular, but not limited to,\nmusic and fashion) as well as other non-artistic contexts, such as\ncostumes, hairstyles, cuisine, and traditional knowledge (Young &\nBrunk 2012).\n\nThe concept of cultural appropriation can be used in either a\ndescriptive or normative sense, and so it is important to be attentive\nto how it is being employed in a particular context. By comparison,\nconsider how \u201cexploitation\u201d can have a descriptive or\nnormative sense (Valdman 2009: 2): you can exploit an opportunity to\nget a snack when the food truck unexpectedly arrives without this\nimplying wrongfulness. Likewise, some writers invoke cultural\nappropriation in a descriptive sense that leaves open whether a\nparticular act of appropriation is wrongful (Young 2008: 18), whereas\nothers employ the normative sense in order to pick out a particular\nkind of wrongful action (Todd 1990: 24).\n\nDisputes over cultural appropriation often have an important racial\ndimension, as in discussions surrounding the blues or hip hop (Rudinow\n1994; Taylor 1995; Taylor 2005). However, this need not be the case.\nFor instance, cultural appropriation (whether wrongful or not) could\nbe thought to arise with respect to cultural groups that cut across\nmultiple racialized groups, such as cultures surrounding disability,\nsexual orientation, gender identity, and religion, as well as arising\nwithin the diverse cultural groups that are circumscribed by a single\nracialized category (Matthes 2016a: 356). In whatever context it\narises, it is generally recognized that an essential ingredient in\nwrongful appropriation is a background of social inequality between\ncultural insiders and cultural outsiders (Ziff & Rao 1997: 5;\nHurka 1999: 184; Hladki 1994). Indeed, given the way in which dominant\ncultural groups tend to assimilate minority cultures, it may even be a\ncategory mistake to speak of members of marginalized cultural groups\n\u201cappropriating\u201d from dominant ones (Rogers 2006:\n480\u20131). That being said, some commentators argue in favor of\nleaving conceptual space for the appropriation of objects or practices\nby marginalized groups, though construed in a beneficial as opposed to\nharmful light (Walsh & Lopes 2012).\n\nA substantial catalyst for academic and popular discussion of cultural\nappropriation (particularly in Canada) was the recommendation in 1992\nof an ad hoc committee of the Canada Council to take cultural\nappropriation into account in its decisions about the award of arts\ngrants (Rowell 1995: 138). Concerns about government funding for work\nabout culturally marginalized peoples made by non-group members are\ntheoretically consistent with finding cultural appropriation\nunobjectionable if it succeeds in the marketplace of its own merits\n(Rowell 1995: 141). However, in more recent years, public and\nscholarly discussion has shifted beyond this narrower question about\ngovernment funding towards more general discussion of whether cultural\nappropriation is wrongful.\n4.2 What Might be Wrong with Cultural Appropriation?\n4.2.1 Offense\n\nOne potential source of the wrongfulness of cultural appropriation is\nthat it can be offensive to cultural group members. If this is the\nsole explanation of wrongful cultural appropriation, then the case is\nrelatively weak: the prima facie reason for thinking that\nappropriation is wrong could be easily defeated by any number of\nmorally significant countervailing factors. While there may be a\ngeneral presumption against needlessly offending others, the fact that\nsomeone might be offended by most anything makes run-of-the-mill\noffense seem relatively easy to justify.\n\nThe prima facie wrongfulness of cultural appropriation\nbecomes weightier if we think that beyond causing mere offense, it can\ncause what Joel Feinberg terms profound offense: \u201can\noffense to one\u2019s moral sensibilities\u2026[that] strikes at a\nperson\u2019s core values or sense of self\u201d (Young 2005: 135).\nNevertheless, even if cultural appropriation is profoundly offensive,\nand thus there is a prima facie reason for thinking it is\nwrongful, one might still think that it can be morally permissible all\nthings considered because of other morally relevant features of the\nact, such as its social value, the value of freedom of expression, the\ntime and place of the act, the extent to which it is tolerated by\ngroup members, and how reasonable the offense is (Young 2005). Given\nthe diversity of values and sensibilities, the potential for profound\noffense is substantial across many domains of social life. While it\nwill be debatable under what circumstances the aforementioned features\ndefeat the prima facie reasons for thinking that profoundly\noffensive appropriation is wrong, the range of cases in which it is\noften thought that profound offense is outweighed by other values\nsuggests that cultural appropriation will often be morally\npermissible, all things considered (Young 2005: 138). Indeed, one\nmight think that cultural appropriation is an essential aspect of\ncultural development, and in fact a beneficial aspect of cultural\ncreativity and exchange (Young 2008; Rogers 2006; Heyd 2003).\n4.2.2 Harm\n\nIn contrast with (or complementary to) the explanation in terms of\noffense, one might also think that cultural appropriation can be\nwrongful because it can cause harm. Analogously to debates about\nharmful vs. offensive speech, if cultural appropriation is harmful,\nthis would raise the bar for countervailing considerations that would\nbe sufficient to render it morally permissible: while harm can be\nmorally justified, there is a strong presumption against causing harm\n(see entry on\n freedom of speech).\n\nSo what might make cultural appropriation harmful? For one, it might\nbe thought to be wrongfully exploitative, defined, for instance,\nas\n\n\nthe appropriation of elements of a subordinated culture by a dominant\nculture without substantive reciprocity, permission, and/or\ncompensation. (Rogers 2006: 477)\n\n\nFor instance, one might think that when cultural outsiders profit from\nthe cultural achievements of insiders who are themselves excluded from\nsuch opportunities due to cultural marginalization and socio-economic\ninequality, they do so unfairly (Keeshig-Tobias 1990; Root 1996; Brown\n2005). Whether or not cultural appropriation is economically harmful\nto cultural group members is a difficult empirical question, and\ncertain cases may suggest that it could be an economic boon (Young\n2008: 114\u201318; Cowen 2002; Shelby 2007: 194). However, even if we\nassume for the sake of argument that cultural appropriation increases\neconomic opportunity for group members, it might still be thought of\nas a form of mutually advantageous exploitation: the features of\nexploitation identified above could persist even in the presence of a\nnet gain in economic opportunity. For instance, one common argument is\nthat cultural appropriation is an instance and extension of\ncolonialism, sharing in its exploitative extraction of labor and\nresources from those with less relative power, and thus does not treat\ncultural group members in a way that recognizes their equality and\nautonomy: culture can be appropriated in the same way that land was\nappropriated by European colonists (Todd 1992, 1990; Coombe 1993;\nRogers 2006; though against the similarity with land and natural\nresources, see Shelby 2007: 193\u20134; for more on explaining the\nwrong of colonialism, see Ypi 2013; see also entry on\n colonialism).\n Moreover, given the ways in which colonial powers often mandated the\neradication of cultural practices, especially for indigenous people,\nthrough, for example, outlawing ceremonies and languages and forcing\nassimilation through residential schools, the prospect of\nsimultaneously benefiting from these same cultural products can seem\nparticularly perverse (Coleman, Coombe, & MacArailt 2012: 178;\nChild 1998).\n\nNow, one might think that whether cultural appropriation qualifies as\nexploitative in these ways will hinge on the viability of a concept of\ncultural property, which, as we saw in\n section 3,\n remains contentious. The thinking is that cultural group members do\nnot have a right to cultural products (nor to an audience for them,\nalong with whatever economic boons it might hold) absent a claim to\nsuch products as their cultural property (Young 2008: Ch. 4). It would\nthus be no more exploitative to use or profit off of cultural products\nthan it is to use or profit off of math: no one has an exclusive right\nto it. On the other hand, one might think the claim of exploitation is\nfitting even in the absence of claims about cultural property.\nBuilding on the colonial narrative, if Urban Outfitters, for instance,\nprofits off the sale of clothes with Navajo patterns while the people\nof the Navajo nation grapple with poverty and its related injustices\n(an ongoing case that came to a head in 2012), then we might\ncharacterize this relationship as exploitative even absent a cultural\nproperty claim (though note that, in fact, the Navajo name is\ntrademarked). This is because the relationship seems to have two\nfeatures that are commonly invoked as jointly sufficient for wrongful\nexploitation: deriving an unfair or opportunistic gain from a\nvulnerable group who cannot reasonably consent (Liberto 2014; Valdman\n2009). Granted, questions remain about the application of the\nexploitation framework. For instance, we might wonder about the\nconditions under which a group could reasonably consent to the use of\ncultural products (though see Lackey 2017), or whether the case above\nis correctly construed as the kind of transaction to which charges of\nexploitation apply (one might claim that Urban Outfitters is not\ncorrectly described as transacting with the Navajo people at all).\n\nA further set of harms often invoked in discussions of cultural\nappropriation are the harms of misrepresentation and silencing.\nMisrepresentation can take many forms. For instance, it can present a\nculture in a false or misleading light. It can traffic in prejudices\nand stereotypes. It can also present a small aspect of a culture (even\nif accurate) as representative of the whole, creating a caricature, or\npresent a cultural practice in a context that perverts its meaning\n(Coleman, Coombe, & MacArailt 2012). Cultural appropriation can\nalso silence members of marginalized cultural groups by skewing public\nunderstanding of cultural expertise away from group members and\ndenying group members opportunities and platforms for cultural\nexpression (Keeshig-Tobias 1990; Todd 1990; Hladki 1994; Coombe 1993).\nThese effects can cumulatively lead to the erosion of cultural forms\nand cultural assimilation of group members (Coleman 2001). Indeed, in\nlight of these effects, some argue that cultural group members may\nhave a political obligation to engage in cultural practices for the\nsake of cultural preservation (Jeffers 2015).\n\nThe related harms of misrepresentation and silencing can be fruitfully\ncouched in terms of philosophical work on epistemic injustice and\nepistemic violence (Fricker 2007; Dotson 2011; Matthes 2016a; Nicholas\n& Wylie 2013). Operating against a broader backdrop of social\nmarginalization, cultural appropriation can inhibit or deny the\nability of group members to speak for and represent themselves,\noffering further support for Loretta Dodd\u2019s definition of\ncultural appropriation as the opposite of cultural autonomy (Todd\n1990). For instance, on this understanding, the disability rights\nslogan \u201cnothing about us without us\u201d can be construed as\nan objection against appropriation through representation.\n\nHowever, these accounts of harmful appropriation are subject to\nphilosophical objections. For instance, we might grant that\nmisrepresentation can be harmful, but deny that such a harm has\nanything to do with appropriation per se: misrepresentations\npromulgated by cultural insiders can be harmful, too (Young 2008: Ch.\n4). Thus the argument that misrepresentation is harmful does not\nestablish that cultural appropriation itself is harmful. In reply, one\nmight note that while misrepresenting oneself and being misrepresented\nby others could be equally harmful, that does not entail that they\nconstitute the same kind or degree of wrong. Moreover, we might\nquestion whether it is important to demonstrate that cultural\nappropriation is a sui generis kind of wrong: indeed, given\nthat harmful cultural appropriation seems to depend on background\nconditions of social inequality, we might think it would be\nunsurprising if a fitting explanation of its wrongfulness overlaps\nsubstantially with the explanation of other wrongs that depend on\nsocial inequality (Matthes 2016a).\n4.2.3 The problem of cultural essentialism\n\nA further persistent objection to the aforementioned accounts of\nwrongful cultural appropriation concerns the problem of cultural\nessentialism, the idea that cultural group membership can be defined\nin terms of a specific set of necessary and sufficient conditions\n(Young 2005). The problem arises because the very concept of cultural\nappropriation seems to be predicated on distinguishing cultural group\nmembers from non-members:\n\n\nThe need to describe a community of insiders and outsiders is implicit\nin most of what has been said about the practice of\nappropriation\u2026some test of group belonging seems required in\ndiscussions about cultural appropriation. (Ziff & Rao 1997: 3)\n\n\nThe objection to essentialism can take both an epistemic/metaphysical\nform and a moral form in the context of cultural appropriation.\n\nFirst, one might contend that essentialist definitions of culture are\nempirically false: cultures do not have rigid boundaries (Patten 2014:\nCh. 2). Even if we granted for the sake of argument that cultural\ngroups could be carved at the joint, we might doubt our ability to\nknow what the correct cultural group boundaries are (Young 2005:\n136\u20137). If either of these objections holds, it seems as if the\nidea of cultural appropriation is at best inapplicable in practice,\nand at worst, conceptually confused.\n\nOn the moral front, one might worry that objections to cultural\nappropriation reify cultural group boundaries in a way that can\nexclude precarious or marginalized group members, or construct\ncaricatures or even oppressive conceptions of cultural authenticity\n(Killmister 2011; Rogers 2006; Shelby 2002: 249\u201354). This can\ngenerate the same kind of harmful cultural misrecognition as cultural\nappropriation itself (Matthes 2016a: 355\u2013358).\n\nThese two sets of objections are aptly encapsulated in Alan\nPatten\u2019s \u201cdilemma of essentialism\u201d for\nmulticulturalism:\n\n\nEither culture is understood in an \u2018essentialist\u2019\nway, in which case multiculturalism is empirically and morally flawed;\nor culture is understood in a nonessentialist way, but the\nconcept no longer supplies multiculturalism with the means of making\nthe empirical judgments and normative claims that matter to it.\n(Patten 2014: 39)\n\n\nCultural essentialism generates a similar dilemma for cultural\nappropriation. How best to solve this dilemma remains an open\nquestion. The answer will depend in part on how best to address more\ngeneral questions about cultural essentialism, and essentialism about\nconceptual categories more broadly (see entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties).\n Moreover, given the use of cultural categories in many everyday\ncontexts, we should be hesitant about inferring from worries about\nessentialism that cultural categories do not exist, or should not be\nemployed, just as objections to racial essentialism should not\nnecessarily lead us to dismiss all talk of racialized categories,\nespecially as a tool for accurately characterizing the effects of\nracism (see entry on\n race).\n Indeed, such assumptions can generate their own harms, for instance,\nby dismissing claims to cultural identity and autonomy on the basis\nthat they are \u201cessentializing\u201d (Todd 1992). But it can\nseem that some theoretically viable understanding of cultural group\nmembership that can survive the metaphysical, epistemological, and\nmoral objections mentioned above is essential to a robust defense of\nthe concept of cultural appropriation. One possible alternative is to\neschew the problem of cultural group membership by shifting our\nattention away from determining who counts as a cultural outsider and\ntoward the background conditions of social marginalization and\ninequality that make cultural appropriation harmful (Matthes 2016a:\n362\u2013366). However, this approach may be inadequate in certain\ncases where identifying specific acts of cultural appropriation is\nitself morally important.\n5. Heritage and Environmental Preservation\n\nWhether or not one favors a distinction between cultural and natural\nheritage (see\n section 1.5\n above), the idea of heritage plays an important role in recent\nthinking about environmental preservation.\n\nAmong the many reasons that one might think that nature is valuable\ninclude the idea that natural things have a certain kind of history,\nin particular, a history independent of human intervention (Elliot\n1982). This belief leads to the conclusion that, at least with respect\nto this particular kind of natural value, environmental restoration is\nimpossible: one cannot restore a history free of human intervention\nthrough human intervention. Thus, if we want to retain this kind of\nvalue, we need to pursue policies of environmental preservation that\nwill protect the natural spaces that bear it (Elliot 1982).\n\nThe sharp distinction between nature and culture represented in this\nview has been criticized from many fronts, for reasons ranging from an\noverly narrow perspective on environmental value to minimizing the\nactual history, and present extent, of human influence on the\nenvironment (Cronon 1995; O\u2019Neill 2002; Scoville 2013; Heyd\n2005). That being said, we might grant that Elliot identifies\nan important environmental value, provided that we do not\nmake the mistake of thinking it is the only one (Matthes 2016b). This\nwill of course significantly temper the power of Elliot\u2019s\nnormative conclusions about the promise of environmental restoration.\nBut a more nuanced understanding of the distinction between nature and\nculture, one that recognizes a broader spectrum rather than a strict\ndichotomy, can still provide reasons for cultivating a respect for\nnature\u2019s self-directedness or \u201cspontaneity\u201d as well\nas reason to preserve and protect this natural heritage (Heyd 2005:\n345). Other approaches to environmental preservation also leverage the\nheritage value of the environment, though emphasizing the cultural\ndimensions of this heritage as well as the \u201cnatural\u201d\nones.\n\nFor instance, one might think that recognizing that the environment is\npart of our cultural heritage can ground distinctive reasons or\nobligations to preserve it (Thompson 2000a). For instance, viewing\naspects of the environment as part of a cultural inheritance from our\nancestors might offer reason to preserve the environment as part of an\nintergenerational social contract (Thompson 2000a,b); or, because\n\u201cparticular places matter to both individuals and communities in\nvirtue of embodying their history and cultural identities\u201d\n(O\u2019Neill, Holland, & Light 2008: 2\u20133) we might think\nour approach to environmental preservation and decision-making should\nbe guided in part by the question: \u201cWhat would make the most\nappropriate trajectory from what has gone before?\u201d\n(O\u2019Neill, Holland, & Light 2008: 156); or, we might\nrecognize that\n\n\nindigenous peoples have long advocated that the conservation and\nrestoration of native species, the cultivation of first foods, and the\nmaintenance of spiritual practices require the existence of plants and\nanimals of particular genetic parentage whose lives are woven with\necologically, economically and culturally significant stories,\nknowledges and memories. (Whyte 2017)\n\n\nOn views like these, despite their differences, to recognize the\nheritage-dimension of the environment is to see its value as\nconsisting, at least in part, in its narrative significance, its role\nin stories that connect us to the past and contribute a distinctive\nmeaning to our lives (Holland 2011; Thompson 2000a; Scoville 2013). To\nsee environmental preservation as guided by the preservation of\nnarrative value can thus have significant implications: for instance,\npreserving narrative value might in fact entail changes to the\nphysical landscape required for preserving meaning rather than\nmaterial continuity or authenticity (O\u2019Neill, Holland, &\nLight 2008: 157; Arntzen 2008).\n\nHow best to capture that narrative value in practice is a difficult\nquestion. For instance, in places that have a history of varied use\n(what some have called \u201clayered landscapes\u201d) how do we\nadjudicate among competing narratives (Hourdequin & Havlick 2011,\n2016)? Rather than the traditional \u201cbaseline problem\u201d for\necological restoration, according to which any particular historical\nbenchmark for returning a space to its \u201cnatural\u201d state\nappears arbitrary (Lee, Hermans, & Hale 2014), we are faced with\nthe problem of deciding how a plurality of historical values ought to\nshape restoration and preservation efforts. Thus, in order to\nunderstand how best to preserve narrative value, it seems we will need\nindependent standards for adjudicating among the value of competing\nnarratives (McShane 2012). This is particularly important given the\nunequal distribution of power in crafting and promulgating historical\nnarratives, which is liable to leave many place-narratives untold or\nunheard (McShane 2012: 60; Palmer 2011: 355\u20136).\n6. Other Topics in Heritage Ethics\n\nThe previous sections discussed topics in heritage ethics that have\nseen the most engagement to date from philosophers. The following\nsubsections offer a brief overview of some other topics in heritage\nethics that have been discussed in the literature.\n6.1 The Ethics of Display\n\nBeyond issues concerning the repatriation of art and artifacts,\nfurther ethical questions arise about how cultural heritage that is\nretained in museums should be displayed. These questions play out\nagainst the backdrop of how non-Western artworks have been regarded in\nthe context of Western art institutions, vacillating between\nrelegation to anthropological museums that challenged their art-status\nto de-contextual display in modern art museums that deprived them of\nrelevant cultural context (Eaton & Gaskell 2012). Analogous to\ndebates about cultural appropriation discussed in\n section 4,\n museums are sometimes challenged for misrepresenting non-Western\ncultures, or lacking relevant participation from cultural group\nmembers (Brown 2009). Thus questions arise about the relative value of\ndifferent kinds of knowledge, how they are prioritized by institutions\nclaiming to steward the past, respectful display, and to whom these\ninstitutions are accountable (Wylie 2005; Pantazatos 2016, 2017;\nGaskell 2008).\n6.2 Further Issues in Archaeological Ethics\n\nSome dimensions of the issues discussed above could be considered part\nof the field of archaeological ethics (Scarre & Scarre 2006;\nVitelli & Colwell-Chanthaphonh 2006; Scarre & Coningham 2013),\nincluding aspects of the literature concerning cultural property,\nrepatriation, and cultural appropriation. However, further ethical\nissues arise concerning, for instance, the ethics of digging for\nrecreational, financial, or subsistence purposes (Hollowell 2006;\nWylie 1996), the professional responsibilities of archaeologists\n(Scarre 2014), and respect for the dead (Scarre 2003).\n6.3 The Ethics of Cultural Heritage Protection in War\n\nSome central aspects of the literature on cultural property have\narisen from discussion and policy surrounding the protection of\ncultural heritage in war, such as the Hague Convention and the Lieber\nCode (Merryman 1986). But further questions concerning the ethics of\ncultural heritage protection in war, such as the permissibility of\ncausing or allowing causalities in order to protect cultural heritage,\nor the obligations (or permissibility) of humanitarian intervention to\nprotect cultural heritage have received only a little philosophical\nattention to date (Thompson 2010; Matthes 2018).",
