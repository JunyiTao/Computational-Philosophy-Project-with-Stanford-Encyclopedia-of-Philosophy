Schopenhauer\u2019s Critique of Kant\n\nSchopenhauer can be called a Kantian in many respects, but he did not\nalways agree with the details of Kant\u2019s arguments. As noted,\nSchopenhauer\u2019s teacher in G\u00f6ttingen was G. E. Schulze, who\nauthored in 1792, a text entitled Aenesidemus, that contains\na criticism of the Kantian philosopher, Karl Leonhard Reinhold\n(1757\u20131823). Reinhold was a defender of Kant, and was known for\nhis Philosophy of the Elements (Elementarphilosophie) that\nwas expressed, along with some earlier writings, in Reinhold\u2019s\n1791 work, The Foundation of Philosophical Knowledge\n(Fundament des philosophischen Wissens).\n\nSchulze\u2019s critique of Kant is essentially the following: it is\nincoherent to posit as a matter of philosophical knowledge \u2013 as\nKant seems to have done \u2013 a mind-independent object that is\nbeyond all human experience, and that serves as the primary cause of\nour sensory experience. Schulze shares this criticism of Kant with F.\nH. Jacobi, who expressed the same objection five years earlier in\nDavid Hume on Faith, or Idealism and Realism, a Dialogue\n[1787] in an appendix entitled \u201cOn Transcendental\nIdealism.\u201d Schulze argues that Kant illegitimately uses the\nconcept of causality to conclude as a matter of strong epistemological\nrequirement, and not merely as a matter of rational speculation, that\nthere is some object \u2013 namely, the thing-in-itself \u2013\noutside of all possible human experience, that is nonetheless the\ncause of our sensations. \n\nSchopenhauer concurs that hypothesizing a thing-in-itself as the cause\nof our sensations amounts to a constitutive application and projection\nof the concept of causality beyond its legitimate scope, for according\nto Kant himself, the concept of causality only supplies knowledge when\nit is applied within the field of possible experience, and not outside\nof it. Schopenhauer therefore denies that our sensations have an\nexternal cause in the sense that we can know there is some\nepistemologically inaccessible object \u2013 the thing-in-itself\n\u2013 that exists independently of our sensations and is the cause\nof them.\n\nThese internal problems with Kant\u2019s argument suggest to\nSchopenhauer that Kant\u2019s reference to the thing-in-itself as a\nmind-independent object (or as an object of any kind) is misconstrued.\nSchopenhauer maintains instead that if we are to refer to the\nthing-in-itself, then we must come to an awareness of it, not by\ninvoking the relationship of causality \u2013 a relationship where\nthe cause and the effect are logically understood to be distinct\nobjects or events (since self-causation is a contradiction in terms)\n\u2013 but through another means altogether. As we will see in the\nnext section, and as we can see immediately in the title of his main\nwork \u2013 The World as Will and Representation \u2013\nSchopenhauer believes that the world has a double-aspect, namely, as\n\u201cWill\u201d (Wille) and as representation\n(Vorstellung). The German word \u201cVorstellung,\u201d can be translated as\n\u201crepresentation,\u201d \u201cpresentation,\u201d\n\u201cidea,\u201d or \u201cmental image.\u201d\n\nSchopenhauer does not believe, then, that Will causes our\nrepresentations. His position is that Will and representations are one\nand the same reality, regarded from different perspectives. They stand\nin relationship to each other in a way that compares to the\nrelationship between a force and its manifestation (e.g., as\nexemplified in the relationship between electricity and a spark, where\nthe spark \u201cis\u201d electricity). This is opposed to saying\nthat the thing-in-itself causes our sensations, as if we were\nreferring to one domino striking another. Schopenhauer\u2019s view is\nthat the relationship between the thing-in-itself and our sensations\nis more like that between two sides of a coin, neither of which causes\nthe other, and both of which are of the same coin and coinage.\n\nAmong his other criticisms of Kant (see the appendix to the first\nvolume of The World as Will and Representation, entitled,\n\u201cCriticism of the Kantian Philosophy\u201d), Schopenhauer\nmaintains that Kant\u2019s twelve categories of the human\nunderstanding \u2013 the various categories through which we\nlogically organize our field of sensations into comprehensible and\ninterrelated individual objects \u2013 are reducible to the single\ncategory of causality, and that this category, along with the forms of\nspace and time, is sufficient to explain the basic format of all human\nexperience, viz., individual objects dispersed throughout space and\ntime, causally related to one another.\n\nSchopenhauer further comprehends these three (and for him,\ninterdependent) principles as expressions of a single principle,\nnamely, the principle of sufficient reason, whose fourfold root he had\nexamined in his doctoral dissertation. In The World as Will and\nRepresentation, Schopenhauer often refers to an aspect of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason as the \u201cprinciple of individuation\u201d\n(principium individuationis), linking the idea of\nindividuation explicitly with space and time, but also implicitly with\nrationality, necessity, systematicity and determinism. He uses the\nprinciple of sufficient reason and the principle of individuation as\nshorthand expressions for what Kant had more complexly referred to as\nspace, time and the twelve categories of the understanding (viz.,\nunity, plurality, totality, reality, negation, limitation, substance,\ncausality, reciprocity, possibility, actuality [Dasein], and\nnecessity).\n",
