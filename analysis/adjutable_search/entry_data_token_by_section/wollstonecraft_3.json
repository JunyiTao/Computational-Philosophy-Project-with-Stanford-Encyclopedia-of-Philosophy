Reputation\n\nAlthough she was very much encouraged by her publisher, Joseph\nJohnson, she received little support from fellow intellectuals in her\nlifetime. Even Godwin did not take to her on their first meeting. Relatively few of the foremost women writers gave Wollstonecraft their\nwholehearted support in the eighteenth century. She received some encouragement for her first publications from Catharine Macaulay, but the latter unfortunately died in 1791, before Wollstonecraft\u2019s career reached its peak. Some mocked her, but rarely were her ideas genuinely assessed in the way they have come to be since the second half of the twentieth century. The\nleading poet, Anna Barbauld (1743\u20131825) was one of the few members of the radical intelligentsia of the time whose opposition to Wollstonecraft was the product of a real engagement with her views on women. By the end of the 1790s and for most of the nineteenth century, Wollstonecraft was derided by many, if only because of what was deemed to have been a scandalous personal life. There were, to be sure, important exceptions, especially in America (Botting and Carey 2004). But such praise as she did receive on both sides of the Atlantic came from arguably limited acquaintance with her ideas or her intellectual persona.\n\nThus it seemed that from the end of the eighteenth century and throughout the\nnext, she, who had endeavoured to place marriage on a solid foundation\nby providing an account of the education that would prepare spouses\nfor it, would be thought of as someone who had sought to pass\nas married when she wasn\u2019t and as the mother of an illegitimate child.\nMuch of this reputation was owed to Godwin\u2019s frank, arguably\nunnecessarily frank, account of Wollstonecraft\u2019s life, in Memoirs\nof the Author of a \u2018Vindication of the Rights of\nWoman\u2019 (1798). It revealed, amongst other personal details,\nher relationship with Imlay and thereby cast a deep shadow over her\nreputation. In any event, John Stuart Mill\u2019s Subjection of\nWomen (1869) was to eclipse most other contributions to feminist\ndebates of the period.\n\nIn the twentieth century, and especially following the growth of\nfeminism in the Anglo-Saxon world in the 1960s, scholars disregarded\nthe vicissitudes of Wollstonecraft\u2019s private life and heralded her as\nthe first English feminist. She came to be read principally within the\ncontext of the history of the women\u2019s movement. Since the last decades\nof the twentieth century, however, a growing number of commentators\nhave looked at A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in its\nhistorical and intellectual context rather than in isolation or in\nrelation to subsequent feminist theories. This has led to renewed\ninterest in her other political writings, including her Letters\nWritten During A Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.\nWollstonecraft has now long ceased to be seen as just a scandalous\nliterary figure, or just the embodiment of a nascent feminism which\nonly reached maturity two hundred years later, but as an Enlightenment\nmoral and political thinker whose works present a self-contained\nargument about the kind of change society would need to undergo for\nmen and women to be virtuous in both the private and the public sphere\nand thereby secure the chance of a measure of happiness.\n\nWhat is more, with growing interest in reception history, the extent\nof her influence in Europe and beyond as been the subject of\nreassessments. It is becoming increasingly evident that\nWollstonecraft was widely read and respected as a pioneer of woman\u2019s\nrights around the world, especially in America, continental Europe, and Brazil (Botting 2013). She was translated into several languages, in the 1790s and throughout the nineteenth century (Johns 2020).\n\nEfforts to place Wollstonecraft\u2019s thought within an international, and specifically an imperial, context have focused on her use of abolitionist discourses, or what Laura Brace (2016) calls the \u2018social imaginary\u2019 of anti-slavery, to criticize British society. Moira Ferguson (1994) places Wollstonecraft in dialogue with nineteenth-century representations of sexual exploitation within the colonial context by such women authors as Jane Austen and Jamaica Kincaid.\n\nWollstonecraft\u2019s reference to slavery and the slave trade as \u201can atrocious\ninsult to humanity\u201d in Vindication of the Rights of\nMen, and her call for social justice more generally, has been\nnoted by Amartya Sen in his The Idea of Justice (2009). Often\nseen as a proponent of liberal values (Sapiro 1992), Wollstonecraft\ncontinues also to placed within a republican tradition, most recently\nby Sandrine Berg\u00e8s (2013), Alan Coffee (2014), and Lena Halldenius\n(2015), who have analysed her view of freedom in terms of independence\nand the absence of subordination to the arbitrary power of others.\n\nIn recent years, scholars have also made use of Wollstonecraft to inform modern feminist discussions, especially those regarding autonomy, education, and nature. Catriona Mackenzie (2016) argues that Wollstonecraft\u2019s understanding of freedom as independence is a forebear to feminist theories that emphasise female autonomy. Sandrine Berg\u00e8s has compared Wollstonecraft\u2019s model of education to modern \u2018capabilities\u2019 approaches that favour grassroots educational programmes. Barbara Seeber (2016) places Wollstonecraft within the tradition of ecofeminism: she argues that Wollstonecraft linked social hierarchies with the domination of nature by human beings. Sandrine Berg\u00e8s (2016) identifies a contradiction in her position on feminist motherhood that remains relevant for feminism today.\n\nTwenty-first century studies have displayed new interest in the philosophical and theological underpinnings of Wollstonecraft\u2019s work. Isabelle Bour (2019) has charted her engagement with competing epistemological models in the 1790s, while Sylvana Tomaselli (2016; 2019) asserts that Wollstonecraft engaged closely with the aesthetic theories of Immanuel Kant and Edmund Burke, as well as Plato\u2019s theory of knowledge, Emily Dumler-Winckler (2019) argues that Wollstonecraft appropriated and sometimes subverted a set of conceptual tools from theology in order to make her arguments for women\u2019s equality. Wollstonecraft\u2019s complex relationship with the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau has been investigated by Christopher Brooke (2019).\n\nWhether Wollstonecraft is best seen as belonging to one tradition or\nany other will remain a matter of dispute. What is important to\nremember is that she responded to a fast changing political situation\nand that she continued to engage critically with public opinion, the\nleading intellectual and political figures of her age, and most\nremarkably, her own views in the light of her experiences in France,\nNorthern Europe and Great Britain. Her critique of Burke, the English\npolitical system, even the aristocracy, became more muted as she found\nthe continued expansion of commerce and growth of the luxury economy\nto lead to even greater inequities than the world it was\nreplacing.\n",
