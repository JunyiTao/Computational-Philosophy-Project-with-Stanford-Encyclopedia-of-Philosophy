    "main_text": "Alternative demarcation criteria || The criterion of puzzle-solving\n4.3 The criterion of puzzle-solving\n\nThomas Kuhn is one of many philosophers for whom Popper\u2019s view\non the demarcation problem was a starting-point for developing their\nown ideas. Kuhn criticized Popper for characterizing \u201cthe entire\nscientific enterprise in terms that apply only to its occasional\nrevolutionary parts\u201d (Kuhn 1974, 802). Popper\u2019s focus on\nfalsifications of theories led to a concentration on the rather rare\ninstances when a whole theory is at stake. According to Kuhn, the way\nin which science works on such occasions cannot be used to\ncharacterize the entire scientific enterprise. Instead it is in\n\u201cnormal science\u201d, the science that takes place between the\nunusual moments of scientific revolutions, that we find the\ncharacteristics by which science can be distinguished from other\nactivities (Kuhn 1974, 801).\n\nIn normal science, the scientist\u2019s activity consists in solving\npuzzles rather than testing fundamental theories. In puzzle-solving,\ncurrent theory is accepted, and the puzzle is indeed defined in its\nterms. In Kuhn\u2019s view, \u201cit is normal science, in which Sir\nKarl\u2019s sort of testing does not occur, rather than extraordinary\nscience which most nearly distinguishes science from other\nenterprises\u201d, and therefore a demarcation criterion must refer\nto the workings of normal science (Kuhn 1974, 802). Kuhn\u2019s own\ndemarcation criterion is the capability of puzzle-solving, which he sees\nas an essential characteristic of normal science.\n\nKuhn\u2019s view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his\ncomparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has\nbeen a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an\nastronomer\u2019s prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he\ncould hope to solve for instance with more measurements or\nadjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such\npuzzles since in that discipline \u201cparticular failures did not\ngive rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make\nuse of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological\ntradition\u201d (Kuhn 1974, 804). Therefore, according to Kuhn,\nastrology has never been a science.\n\nPopper disapproved thoroughly of Kuhn\u2019s demarcation criterion.\nAccording to Popper, astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and\nconsequently Kuhn\u2019s criterion commits him to recognize astrology\nas a science. (Contrary to Kuhn, Popper defined puzzles as\n\u201cminor problems which do not affect the routine\u201d.) In his\nview Kuhn\u2019s proposal leads to \u201cthe major disaster\u201d\nof a \u201creplacement of a rational criterion of science by a\nsociological one\u201d (Popper 1974, 1146\u20131147).\n",
