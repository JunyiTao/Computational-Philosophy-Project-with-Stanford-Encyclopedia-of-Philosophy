    "main_text": "Philosophical Psychology || The Therapy of the Emotions\n3.3 The Therapy of the Emotions\n\nQuestions relating to Stoic psychological monism have been most widely\ndiscussed with a view to the theory of the emotions\u2014here, it\nmakes a great difference whether we think that irrational desires can\novercome reason, or are irrational acts of the rational soul.\nSeneca\u2019s treatment of the emotions has been scrutinized for\nindications of both points of view. Sorabji interprets Seneca as\nsituating his account of the emotions vis-\u00e0-vis early and\nmiddle Stoic theories that differ from his own (1989); Fillon-Lahille\nstudies On Anger with source-critical methods (1984).\nAccording to others, On Anger can be studied as a treatise on\nemotion that is basically in agreement with Stoic psychological\nmonism, and appreciated for the detailed treatment that Seneca devotes\nto this, as he sees it, particularly violent emotion (Cooper 1999;\nVogt 2006).\n\nAccording to the Stoics, the ideal agent has no emotions. Stoic theory\nof the emotions does not aim at moderation or \u201cadequate\u201d\nemotional responses. Rather, it aims at a life without emotions.\nHowever, the Stoics do not suggest that the perfect agent is\naffectively inert. Rational affective reactions and dispositions\nreplace emotion. The ideal agent has \u201cgood feelings\u201d of\nwishing (which replaces desire), caution (which replaces fear), and\njoy (which replaces pleasure) (Cooper 2005; Graver 2007, 51\u201355;\nKamtekar 2005). Further, the ideal agent has proto-emotions, that is,\ninitial affective and physiological reactions that do not depend on\nassent (On Anger 2.1\u20134; 1.16.7). These responses which,\nfor Seneca and early Stoics, do not count as emotions, have recently\nbeen a starting point in comparing Stoic and Chinese philosophy, and\ndescribed in terms of self-emerging feelings (Machek 2015).\n\nThe conceptions of good or rational feelings (i.e., the affective\ndispositions and reactions of the wise person) and proto-emotions\nrender Stoic thought on the emotions less implausible than it is\nsometimes taken to be. But still, students of ancient theories of\nemotion have often felt that one simply must side with an Aristotelian\nposition\u2014with the view that there are adequate, measured\nemotions. Suppose someone commits a crime; are we not justly angry,\nand should we not react to the crime? As Seneca puts it, will the\nideal agent not be angry if he sees his father murdered and his mother\nraped? Yes, he argues, we should react, but not with emotions and\nemotional action (revenge), no matter how curbed they might be through\nreflection. The idea of \u201cmoderate emotions,\u201d says Seneca,\nis about as absurd as the idea of \u201cmoderate insanity\u201d\n(Letter 85.9). Emotions are irrational (85.8); there is no\ntaming of the irrational, precisely because it is irrational. Emotions\nthus cannot be moderated\u2014they must be replaced with\nrational responses. The ideal agent will avenge and defend others out\nof duty (quia oportet) (On Anger 1.12), not out of\nanger or lust for revenge. Scholars disagree, however, whether\nSeneca\u2019s consolatory writings are an exception. According to Konstan\n(2015), Seneca\u2019s consolations recommend metriopatheia,\nmoderate affection, instead of apatheia, the elimination of\ngrief. Alternatively, Fournier argues that Ad Marciam\ndisplays a progression from the aim of moderate grief to the aim of\nelimination of grief (2009). According to Machek (2015), moments where\nSeneca seems to advocate metriopatheia can be interpreted as\ninvoking the ideal agent\u2019s proto-emotions.\n\nSeneca\u2019s detailed analysis of anger adds in interesting ways to\nour knowledge of how, precisely, the Stoic claim that emotions\nare opinions plays out. According to the early Stoics, there\nare four generic emotions: pleasure (in the sense of being pleased\nabout something), pain (in the sense of being distressed or feeling\ndispleased), desire, and fear. Pleasure is directed at a presumed good\nthat is present; pain at a presumed bad that is present; desire at a\npresumed good in the future; fear at a presumed bad in the future.\nSince emotions are impulses, they result in action (if there is no\nexternal impediment). Anger counts as a kind of desire. In anger, the\nagent assents to the impression that she should take revenge. But the\njudgment that first generates anger is something like \u2018He\nwronged me\u2019. On Anger thus helps shed light on the way\nin which several judgments can figure in one emotion, and how emotion\nis tied up with irrational action (Vogt 2006; Kaster 2010,\nIntroduction).\n\nIn recent years, scholars have increasingly turned to a topic that is\nprominently discussed in the Aristotelian tradition, so-called\nakrasia or lack of control (for discussion of Seneca\u2019s\nengagement with Aristotelian ideas in ethics and psychology, see\nInwood 2014, 73-104). On the Aristotelian account, the akratic agent\nacts contrary to her correct reasoning and based on desire. This view\nseems recognizable to many. It captures that desire can seem\noverpowering, \u201cwinning\u201d in a perceived struggle between\nreason and desire. Stoic psychological monism can appear colorless and\nunrealistic in comparison. It cannot accommodate the sense that reason\nand desire are in conflict. For the Stoics, each motivational state is\na thought. What Aristotelians call akrasia is, on one early\nStoic account, an oscillation between opinions (M\u00fcller 2014). For\nexample, an agent thinks in quick succession \u201cI\u2019ll have\nanother cookie\u201d and \u201cI won\u2019t have another cookie\u201d;\nher hand reaches out to take the cookie at a moment when she thinks\nthe former. Recent Seneca scholars have asked whether Seneca adheres\nto the oscillation view of conflicted motivation, or whether his\naccount is closer to Aristotelian akrasia. Sorabji argues\nthat the Latin term \u201cimpotens\u201d is Seneca\u2019s\ntranslation of the Greek \u201cakrates\u201d (lacking\ncontrol); he proposes that in Seneca all cases of anger are cases of\nakrasia (2000, 61). According to Gartner (2015), on the other\nhand, On Anger is fully in agreement with Stoic monism.\nSeneca\u2019s analysis of anger involves tumultuous states of mind,\nbut it does not involve the distinctive state of akrasia.\nWithin the framework of Aristotelian theory, akrasia is worse\nthan control (enkrateia) and much worse than virtue. Gartner\nnotes that Seneca also cannot accommodate control, because\ncontrol\u2014just as akrasia\u2014involves a distinction\nbetween reason and desire that is alien to Seneca\u2019s framework.\nOther scholars pursue intermediate approaches. Rather than avoid the\nAristotelian term akrasia, M\u00fcller (2014) discusses\nSeneca\u2019s views on motivational conflict in terms of\nakrasia; but he ascribes distinctively Stoic views to Seneca.\nOn his reading of Seneca\u2019s tragedy Medea, Medea\u2019s\nconflicted motivations exemplify the oscillation model. Maso (2018)\nemphasizes Seneca\u2019s engagement with the corporeality of the\nsoul, as the Stoics conceive of it. On his reading, On Anger\ndevelops a version of psychological monism that permits dualist\nimagery and that explains motivational conflict in part in terms of\nthe physiology of inner turmoil (on the physiology of anger in On\nAnger, see also Riggsby 2015).\n\nNext to anger, Seneca pays most attention to fear and grief, emotions\nthat tend to dominate human life due to human mortality (NQ\n6.1.1\u20134.2; 32.1\u201312; on grief, see esp. Letters\n26, 63, 77). Fear of death is paradoxical: It wants to preserve life,\nbut it spoils life (6.32.9). It is one of the key tasks for the\nprogressor to come to terms with death (Edwards 2014; Mann 2006;\nLetters 1.2 and 4.3\u20139). Fear makes us \u201close our\nminds,\u201d and thus literally removes rationality (NQ\n6.29). It is through changing our views regarding the presumed badness\nof death that we can overcome fear and grief. Death is a natural\nevent, and understanding death is part of the study of nature. We fear\nmost what we do not understand; knowledge cures fear (NQ\n6.3.4). Seneca takes seriously two accounts of death: either death is\na transition to a better afterlife, or it is a genuine end. In his\ntragedies, Seneca explores more troubling scenarios (see above). The\ntragedies might illustrate irrational attitudes to death; or they\nmight be a testament to the fact that consolatory philosophy cannot\nsilence these darker visions (for a discussion of death in\nSeneca\u2019s prose writings and poetry, and a defense of the latter\nview, see Busch 2009). \n\nIn On Peace of Mind 15.1, Seneca raises an interesting\nquestion. Why does the ideal agent not deplore vice, and so feel in\nsome way bad about it? This question bears on a key aspect of the\nStoic theory. Although there are four generic emotions, there are only\nthree rational feelings; they replace pleasure, desire, and fear.\nThere is no rational correlate to pain or distress, i.e., to those\nemotions in which we judge something bad to be present. Of course, the\nwise person will not judge that illness or loss of money is bad; she\nknows that only vice is bad. But why does she not make precisely this\njudgment\u2014that vice is bad\u2014in such a way that an affective\nstance of \u2018rational deploring\u2019 goes along with it? Seneca\ngives an answer that is in agreement with the fundamental Stoic claim\nthat virtue benefits. The sage puts on a smile, rather than being\nsaddened, because his cheerfulness gives hope. This reply, brief as it\nis, perhaps contains the core of an argument relevant to the Stoic\nstance on (what we call) the \u2018negative moral emotions\u2019.\nPart of this argument might be that virtue does not allow for rational\nnegative affective responses, since such responses would not\nbenefit.\n\nIn his discussion of how the virtuous person responds to weaknesses in\nothers, Seneca extends the Stoic spectrum of rational feelings to\ninclude mercy (clementia). Seneca\u2019s treatise On\nMercy has puzzled historians: by praising the goodness of the\nyoung Nero as Emperor\u2014his mercy, as opposed to cruelty,\nseverity, and pity\u2014Seneca creates the prototype of \u201cadvice\nto princes\u201d literature (see Long 2003; cf. Kaster 2010 for a\nbrief introduction to the treatise). We cannot here enter into the\nquestion of whether Seneca chooses to ignore or did not know of the\nmurder Nero had recently committed. Perhaps the answer is simply that\nthings look different in hindsight (see Braund 2009). The Latin term\nfor mercy, clementia, is difficult to translate; sometimes\nscholars opt for clemency, thus signaling that Seneca discusses a\nvirtue that we are not immediately familiar with. In On\nMercy, clementia is a virtue of a superior. This is in\nitself a novelty within Stoic ethics. Earlier Stoics did not conceive\nof virtues for particular roles. Instead, virtue or wisdom is thought\nto translate into role-specific kinds of expertise whenever a virtuous\nperson comes to have such a role. The notion of clemency, as Seneca\ndevelops it, has its origin in Roman self-descriptions: clemency is a\nvirtue that Rome exercises vis-a-vis defeated peoples (on Seneca\u2019s\nconception of the state in On Mercy, see Wildberger 2018c,\n169-171). That is, clemency is an attitude that was originally\ndisplayed towards enemies, not towards one\u2019s own citizens; with\nCaesar, it becomes the virtue of an emperor (these are the outlines of\na highly instructive sketch of the concept\u2019s history in Braund\n2009). \n\nIn Seneca, clementia is a kind of restraint in a powerful\nperson who might otherwise lash out and act cruelly, and it is\nsomething like equity (cf. Braund 2009). Arguably, the first kind of\nclementia is not a Stoic virtue. A person whose savagery\nneeds to be contained cannot count as virtuous (Vogt 2011). Scholars\nalso raise the question of whether equity, understood as the ability\nof a ruler to judge a case by all its particular characteristics\n(rather than simply apply a rule) fits into Stoic philosophy (Braund\n2009). \u2018Equity\u2019 is the standard translation of the Greek\nepieikeia, which Aristotle discusses in Nicomachean\nEthics V.10. Aristotle discusses a well-known problem: the law is\ngeneral, but every case that needs to be judged is particular. Equity\nis a juridical virtue; it aims to remedy an inevitable feature of the\nlaw understood as a set of rules: its generality. According to two\ndoxographical passages, the Stoics do not ascribe equity to their wise\nperson (DL 7.123 and Stobaeus, 2.96.4\u20139). However, these texts\nare plausibly understood as making the claim that the Stoics do not\nascribe Aristotelian equity \u2014and that is, the equity\nthat aims to remedy the shortcomings of general rules\u2014to the\nwise person. The law, as the Stoics conceive of it, is not the\npositive set of laws in a given political community. For them, the\nonly law worthy of the name \u2018law\u2019 is identical with\nreason, and thus with what should be done (Vogt 2008, chapter 4).\nEquity of a distinctively Stoic kind, understood as the ability to\njudge every case by fully appreciating all particular circumstances,\nfits perfectly into the larger framework of Stoic ethics (Vogt\n2011).\n",
