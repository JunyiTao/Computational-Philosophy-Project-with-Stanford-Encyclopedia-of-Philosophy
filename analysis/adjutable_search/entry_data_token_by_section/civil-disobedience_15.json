Is\npunishment appropriate at all? If there is a right to civil\ndisobedience, then, as we saw, it protects people from punishment.\nEven if there isn\u2019t, is punishment indefensible if it sanctions\nmorally justified civil disobedience? The tensions become clear when\nwe consider the criminal law\u2019s function, which is to punish and\nprevent crimes, that is, to tackle wrongful conduct. Unlike civil\nwrongs, which are privately brought, criminal wrongs are public\nwrongs: the polity, not the victim (there may not be any), prosecutes\nthe alleged wrongdoer. Punishment, depending on one\u2019s\noverarching account, serves to: dissuade people from committing the\ntypes of conduct identified as wrongful (Bentham 1789 [1970]);\nappropriately respond to those who culpably commit them (Moore 1997),\nincluding by engaging with them in a moral dialogue so that they\nrepent and reform (Duff 1998); and/or express the community\u2019s\nmoral disapproval of such conduct (Feinberg 1994). So, we may ask,\nfrom the consequentialist, forward-looking standpoint, whether the\nstate should deter civil disobedience; and, from a retributivist\n(desert-based) or communicative, backward-looking perspective, whether\ncivil disobedients deserve the community\u2019s censure (Bennett and\nBrownlee 2021).\n\nIf civilly disobedient breaches of law are public wrongs, comparable\nto or worse than ordinary offenses, then civil disobedients should be\npunished similarly or more severely than those who commit ordinary\noffenses. Kent Greenawalt lays out reasons to hold that civil\ndisobedients deserve the same punishment as others who breach the same\nlaws. First, the demands of proportionality would seem to recommend a\nuniform application of legal prohibitions. Since trespass is\nprohibited, persons who breach trespass laws in protest of either\nthose laws or other laws would seem to be equally liable to persons\nwho breach trespass laws for private purposes. Second, any principle\nthat officials may use to excuse justified illegal acts will result in\nsome failures to punish unjustified acts, for which the purposes of\npunishment would be more fully served. Even when officials make\ncorrect judgments about which acts to excuse, citizens may draw\nmistaken inferences, and restraints of deterrence and norm acceptance\nmay be weakened for unjustified acts that resemble justified ones\n(Greenawalt 1987, 273). What follows is that all such violations,\njustified and unjustified, should be treated the same.\n\nThere also are reasons to believe that civil disobedients should be\ndealt with more severely than are others who have offended. First, as\nmentioned above, disobedients seem to have put themselves above the\nlaw in preferring their own moral judgment about a certain issue to\nthat of the democratic decision-making process and the rule of law.\nSecond, the communicative aspect of civil disobedience could be said\nto aggravate disobedient offenses since their communication usually is\nattended by much greater publicity than most covert violations are.\nThis forces legal authorities to concern themselves with the\npossibility that law-abiding citizens will feel distressed, insecure,\nand perhaps imposed on, if no action is taken. So, notes Greenawalt,\nwhile authorities may quietly let minor breaches pass, failure to\nrespond to violations performed, in some respect, in the presence of\nauthority, may undercut claims that the rules and the persons who\nadministered them deserve respect (1987, 351\u20132). Third, and\nrelated, civil disobedients often invite, and might inspire, other\ncitizens to do what they do. Such risk of proliferation of civil\ndisobedience and, further, of its escalation into lawlessness and\nviolence, may support the imposition of more severe punishment for\nagents engaged in civil disobedience.\n\nHowever, both the models of civil disobedience presented above, which\nstress its role and value in liberal democracies, and the arguments\nfor the right to civil disobedience examined below, strongly push for\nthe opposite view that civil disobedients, if punished at all, should\nbe dealt with more leniently than others who have offended. The\npreceding discussion highlights that civil disobedience is in fact a\npublic good \u2013 a crucial component of democratic culture, in\nHabermas\u2019s words \u2013 and, hence, many theorists defend the\nstate\u2019s responsibility to treat civil disobedients\nleniently.\n\nDworkin argues that the state has a \u201cspecial responsibility to\ntry to protect [the civil disobedient], and soften his predicament,\nwhenever it can do so without great damage to other policies\u201d\n(Dworkin 1978, 260). The government can exercise its responsibility of\nleniency by not prosecuting civil disobedience at all, depending on\nthe balance of reasons, including individual rights, state interests,\nsocial costs, and constitutional benefits. Reasons for prosecuting in\nany particular case are \u2018practical\u2019, not intrinsic or\ndeontological, and always potentially defeasible. In general,\nprosecutors should not charge disobedients with the most serious\noffenses applicable and judges should give them light sentences.\nLeniency follows from the recognition of the special constitutional\nstatus of civil disobedience.\n\nIn this view, officials at all levels have the discretion to not\nsanction civil disobedients, and they should use it. Prosecutors have\nand should use their discretion not to press charges against civil\ndisobedients in some cases, or to charge them with the least serious\noffense possible. Dworkin (1985) urges judges to engage in an open\ndialogue with civil disobedients (at least those who articulate legal\narguments in defense of their actions) and dismiss their charges after\nhearing them, or to use their discretion in sentencing, for instance\nby accepting guilty pleas or guilty verdicts but imposing trivial\npunishments.\n\nHowever, this proposal could amount to letting judges evaluate the\nworthiness of individual civil disobedients\u2019 causes, which would\nnot on its own guarantee judicial leniency. To the contrary, judges\nmight well systematically decide against civil disobedients, upholding\nthe special interests of the ruling class of which they are part. The\nproceduralist insistence on courts\u2019 neutrality avoids this\npitfall, and generally warns against turning courtrooms into political\nforums. Yet the transformation of courts into public fora might not be\nso insidious, and may indeed be part of a necessary institutional\nreform to provide civil disobedients with a platform, perhaps along\nthe lines of Arendt\u2019s (1972, 101\u20132) proposal to treat\ncivil disobedients as a kind of people\u2019s lobbyists (see Smith\n2011).\n",
