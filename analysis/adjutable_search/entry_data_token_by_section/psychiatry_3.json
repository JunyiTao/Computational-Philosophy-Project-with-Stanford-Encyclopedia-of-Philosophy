Individuals who share a DSM diagnosis have a\nsubset of symptoms in common, often drawn from a larger list so that\nalthough some people may have all their symptoms in common, there may\nbe no overlap at all in other cases. These collections of symptoms are\nalso supposed to unfold over time in more or less the same way, once\nwe make due allowances for some individual variation. They are also\nexpected to respond to treatment in the same way. The previous version\nof the DSM assumed that each\ndiagnosis represented malfunction in some mental, physical or\nbehavioural trait or capacity (DSM-IV-TR, xxi). However, the diagnoses\nwere listed without worrying about what that underlying malfunction\nmight be, and in most cases there was (and remains) no agreement about\nwhat causes what. DSM-5 defines mental disorders (p. 20) as syndromes\ncomprising clinically significant disturbances of cognition, emotion\nor behaviour that reflect underlying dysfunctions. These are normally\nassociated with distress or social disability, but cannot be diagnosed\nif the behaviour is culturally normal or merely socially deviant,\nunless it reflects a dysfunction. \n\n\nDSM diagnoses are usually taken to reflect a conventional concept of\ndisease, despite the talk of underlying malfunction, because of the\nemphasis on syndromes and the lack of causal hypotheses. In the\nmanner of the minimal medical model, they let us make use of\ndescriptive and statistical reasoning and offer the hope of accurate\nprediction and effective control. In the opinion of some philosophers,\nthat is all science ever aspires to. I began by citing a textbook\ndeclaration that psychiatry uses normal medical methods, and there is\ncertainly nothing within McHugh and Slavney\u2019s discussion of mental\nillness that makes scientific methods inapplicable.\n\n\nOther philosophers, though, will tell you that the job of science is\nto discover the causal structure of the world. Furthermore, there are\nplenty of students of psychopathology who argue that the neglect of\ncausal structure in psychopathology is getting in the way of science\n(Poland, Von Eckardt and Spaulding 1994, Murphy 2006, Gerrans\n2014). They worry that we are lumping together different groups of\npeople based on behavioral evidence alone, when in fact their\nobservable similarities mask important underlying differences,\nincluding differences between normal people who are troubled but\nbasically healthy, and their pathological counterparts. From this\nphilosophical-cum-clinical perspective it looks like dereliction of\nduty when any scientific discipline isolates itself from inquiry into causes. Suppose we ask why\nthe conventional view of diseases is successful in organizing\nprediction and control (what psychiatrists sometimes call\n\u201cpredictively valid\u201d). The obvious answer is that\nsuccessful predictive categories are actually tracking the causal\nstructure in the world that accounts for the shared nature of the\ndifferent instances, so we should aim for a stronger validation of the\ndiagnosis than mere predictive validity. Whilst the reliability of a\ndiagnosis is a gauge of agreement across measurements and observers,\nvalidity is supposed to be about what is really there. It looks\nobvious that even the most expert observers could all agree but\nnonetheless be wrong, whereas proper validation reassures us that we\nare measuring something that is really there. (Psychiatrists employ\nthe concept of validity in several ways; for help in sorting them out,\nsee Fulford et al. (2006: 318\u201319), Schaffner (2012) and the\nessays in Zachar et al. 2014.)\n\n\nSomeone committed to a strong version of the medical model sees\nvalidating a diagnosis as understanding its underlying causal\nstructure: a valid diagnosis rests on a biological process\nthat can be identified by experiment and observation using the methods\nof the biological and cognitive sciences. Any approach to psychiatry\nthat looks to science to validate its categories in this way must meet\nat least two conceptual challenges. First, there is a metaphysical\nchallenge, which is that a concept of validity tied to the uncovering\nof neurobiological processes seemingly adopts a realist philosophical\nposition, thinking that science can tell us how the world is really\nput together. Many philosophers think that realism is a wholly\nunnecessary and unwarranted metaphysical commitment, and that all\nscience can really tell us about is a set of relationships among the\ndata. These relationships let us make predictions and exert some\ncontrol over nature, but do not tell us what is really out\nthere. Philosophical disputes over realism have often centred on the\nnotion of the unobservable. In psychiatry\nthe situation is different; theories and constructs refer to latent\nvariables rather than unobservables.  Schizophrenia, as a\nconstruct, is not a further type of stuff that lies behind the\nappearances and explains them: it is constituted by visible\nphenomena. We are not looking for an unobservable, but asking which\nobservable phenomena (neurological, genetic, developmental, social)\nexplain the symptoms. If the strong conception of the medical model is\nphilosophically realist, it is so in light of its commitment to\ncauses, not to unobservables.  We may look for a hidden variable that\nexplains the observable phenomena, or for some other hypothetical\nunderlying cause. Gold and Gold (2014, p.163\u201366) for example, suggest\nthat many delusions and other psychotic symptoms may reflect a\nmalfunctioning \u201cSuspicion System\u201d that has evolved to\ndetect and monitor social threats. If such a system exists it is not\ndirectly observable, but its components should be open to observation\nand manipulation via the standard methods of the cognitive\nsciences. Psychiatry, like many sciences, deals in hidden variables or\nhypothetical causal structures, but it is not helpful to think of\nthese as unobservable in the traditional sense.  \n\n\nThe second conceptual challenge to the realist interpretation of\nvalidity is normative. The challenge is that there is an important\nsense in which diagnoses cannot be validated at all, if by\n\u201cvalidation\u201d we mean \u201cshown to be a real\ndisorder\u201d. All validation can do is show that a pattern of\nbehaviour deemed to be clinically significant depends on a physical\nprocess. Whether that pattern of behaviour is really pathological -\nrather than immoral or harmlessly odd- is another matter. The second\nchallenge probably is very hard to meet. It requires that judgements\nof pathology be scientifically\ngrounded, rather than human judgements. If\nso, there has to be some natural fact of the matter about whether some\nphysical system is dysfunctional. If this cannot be done, then\npredictions about physical states can be validated, but disorders\ncannot be. \n \nThe DSM classification has been designed to improve communication\nbetween psychiatrists and across disciplines and provide a basis for\neducation. But it is not advertised as the jumping-off point for a\nmature system of causally organised classification and practice. This\nreflects a minimal interpretation of the medical model; it can guide\nempirical research but not uncover causal structure. This leaves it\nopen to the charge that a classification which groups together\nobservable phenomena can sort entities into heterogeneous classes,\nwith underlying diversity masked by surface similarities so that like\ncases are not grouped with like cases (Tabb 2015). We already know\nfrom other areas of medicine that what looks like the same\nphenomenon\u2014a cough, say, or a sore throat, or chest\npain\u2014can reflect different biological processes and hence may\nreally signify different conditions. A taxonomy that is content with\nsurface features risks lumping different conditions together and\nkeeping related ones apart.\n\n\nHere are some examples of this charge in the recent literature (for\nothers, see Murphy 2006 (chapters 1\u20133) and McNally, 2012). Ross\net al. (2008, 33\u201334, 200\u201301) suggested some revisions to the current\ndiagnostic category of Pathological Gambling (PG) (see DSM-IV-TR, 671\u201374).\nThe category of pathological gambling is designed to operationalize a\nconcept whose content is, roughly, gambling that causes problems for\nthe gambler. But Ross et al. reasoned as follows: the existing category\n\u201cmaps relatively smoothly onto the class of people who exhibit\nclassic patterns of addictive behaviour as a result of a specific kind\nof dysfunction in their dopaminergic reward system and consequent\nneuroadaptation impairing frontal control circuits. We therefore\nbelieve that clarity would be served \u2026 by replacing the\nbehaviourally derived concept of PG with the neuroscientifically\nanchored concept of addictive gambling (200)\u201d.\n\n\nA judgment that DSM categories have insufficient validity led the\nNational Institute of Mental Health to introduce the Research Domain\nCriteria (RDoC) in grant proposals (Insel et al. 2010). The\noriginators of the RDoC acknowledged that the system entrenched by\nprevious versions of the DSM has increased diagnostic reliability. But\nthey worried that it was too detached from the nature of mental\nillness, which they conceived of as disorders of brain circuits. For\nexample, rather than existing categories such as depression, the RDoC\nenvisaged a domain of negative valence including symptoms of anxiety\nor depression that might come to be seen as expressions of an\nunderlying disorder of specific brain circuits (Sanislow et al 2010)\n. These disorders could be studied at many levels and need not be\nidentified with simple lesions. But future models of mental illness\nare expected, on this vision, to draw on psychological, neurological,\nand genetic mechanisms, as well as information about the wider\ncultural context. In this case, validating a diagnosis is thought of\nas understanding its underlying causal structure: a diagnosis is valid\nif it rests on a biological process that can be identified by\nexperiment and observation using the methods of the biological and\ncognitive sciences. (For philosophical discussion of the RDoC in the\ncontext of precision medicine, see Tabb 2020).\n\n\nRoss and his colleagues argued along similar lines in their discussion\nof gambling. They thought there were two benefits to the conceptual\nchange that they wanted. First, it would provide a clearer and\nprincipled demarcation of the addicted gambler from the \u201cproblem\ngambler\u201d which is currently somewhat arbitrary (201). They also\nshowed the way to a better understanding of the nature of the addictive\ndisorders more generally via the use of their preferred approach,\nwhich combined neuroscience and behavioural economics. They drew on\nprior research (ch. 6.2) to suggest that addictive gambling resembles\ndependence on stimulants (like cocaine) more than it does alcoholism,\nand hence enlarges our understanding of addiction more fully than\npurely behavioural criteria would do. The worry is that a behavioural\napproach misses the similarities and differences between forms of\naddiction by treating all as more or less the same, based on shared\nbehavioural and phenomenological effects.\n\n\nTo make these arguments we have to distinguish the truly\npathological gambler, whose life is dominated (and typically wrecked)\nby gambling, from merely habitual gamblers. Habitual gamblers might\nengage in gambling more than they feel they should, or periodically\nlose more than they can afford, but there is a qualitative difference\nbetween this population and the population of genuinely addicted\ngamblers. This qualitative difference is detected by observing\nbehaviour and rating the results of questionnaires. However, if we\nclassify gamblers according to quantitative measures alone, we miss the\nreason why different groups behave differently. The reason is a causal\nprocess. The brains of the real addicts don\u2019t work like the\nbrains of the merely troubled; thinking of addiction merely in terms of\nhabitual behaviours will not let us make the discriminations among\ngamblers that neuroscientific evidence detects.\n\n\nA stronger but similar argument was made by Horwitz and\nWakefield (2007). They claim that only a hypothesis about causes\ndistinguishes a normal population from a disordered one. They\nbegin with the DSM criteria for diagnosing major depression. A subject must suffer from\nfive of the following nine symptoms in a two week period (including\neither or both of depressed mood or diminished interest or pleasure in\nalmost all activities): depressed mood; diminished interest; weight\ngain or loss (without dieting) or change in appetite; insomnia or\nexcessive sleep; observable psychomotor agitation or retardation;\nfatigue or loss of energy; feeling worthless or excessively guilty;\ndiminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness;\nrecurrent thoughts of death or suicide or a planned or attempted\nsuicide.\n\n\nObviously many ordinary episodes in a person\u2019s life can cause\nbehaviors or feelings from this list, such as losing one\u2019s job.\nThe traditional concept of melancholy or depression, which in the West has a\ncontinuous history going back to classical antiquity (Radden 2000),\nsees pathology only where\none\u2019s circumstances do not justify a normal melancholy response.\n\n\nThe DSM, however, ignores this tradition. Anyone who fits the syndrome\nreceives the diagnosis regardless of how their life is going.  The\nsole exception stipulates that grief following bereavement does not\ncount towards diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder until two months\nhave elapsed, after which one may diagnose major depression. But not\neven that qualification is made if you show depressive symptoms after\nyour intended jilts you at the altar or you fail all your exams or get\nyour legs blown off. In subsequent work Horwitz and Wakefield (2012)\n extended their analysis to the anxiety disorders. They argued\nthat normal human anxieties are being pathologized and that the\ndiagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression have been much too\nsharply distinguished from those for depression, leading to an\ninability to explain why depression and anxiety so often co-occur.\n\n\nDuring the run-up to DSM-5 the Mood Disorders Work Group proposed\neliminating the bereavement exclusion. This met considerable\nprofessional and public opposition (see\nZachar 2014, ch. 10 for a summary of the debate and a discussion of\nthe issues). From the standpoint of Horwitz and Wakefield, the\nproposal appeared to be pathologizing a normal human\nreaction. However, it was never suggested that grieving itself was\npathological. Rather, the proposal was based on the idea that\nstressful life events often precipitate episodes that meet the\ncriteria for a major depressive episode, and there is no reason to\nexempt bereavement. Many people, after the death of a loved one,\nexhibit symptoms very like those of major depression, and are at risk\nfor subsequent episodes. From this perspective, the elimination of the\nbereavement exclusion is justified by science, regardless of common\nsense (Kendler et al 2007; Lamb et al 2010). Why should bereavement\nalone be exempted from the general claim that depression is caused by\nstressful life events?\n\n\nHorwitz and Wakefield suggest that genuine depression is caused by a\ndysfunction on the part of a loss-response system that evolved to\nrespond to losses that threaten to deprive us of reproductive\nresources. In depression the system misfires. It causes a\nloss-response in situations where it should not. Whether or not that\nis convincing, the argument that Horwitz and Wakefield make about the\nconflation of depression and sadness stands on its own merits. They\nmake the case that the DSM conception of depression respects neither\nfolk psychological common sense nor previous psychiatric consensus\nabout depression. They conclude that the concept of depression defined\nby this diagnostic syndrome represents a major conceptual break. Our\nuse of the new concept, they suggest, means that many people who are\njust normally miserable for understandable and ordinary reasons are\nbeing diagnosed as depressed. This leads to unnecessary alarm about an\nepidemic of depression as well as carrying unfortunate consequences\nfor many people who are wrongly diagnosed. However, it is certainly\nopen to those theorists opposed to the bereavement exclusion to insist\nthat if depression is the result of an underlying system that\nmisfires, it could misfire in response to bereavement. The proposal is\nnot that everyone who grieves should be called depressed, but that\nthere are reactions to bereavement that are severe enough to meet the\ncriteria for major depression and should be classed as such. \n\n\nThe DSM concept of depression, on the face of it, lumps together\ndifferent psychological and behavioral types in the same category. It\ndoes this because it neglects the diverse etiologies that may produce\nsimilar signs and symptoms. There is no way to answer this charge, or\nto arrive at a satisfactory taxonomy that mirrors that of general\nmedicine, unless we adopt a causal foundation for nosology as suggested\nby psychiatrists who urge the adoption of what I have called the strong\nmedical model. Indeed, without an account of underlying causal\nstructure, it becomes difficult to give a principled answer to the\nquestion why some conditions should be seen as pathological to begin\nwith. Merely saying that members of a class have certain properties\ndoes not tell us whether, let alone why, they are mentally ill. To\nanswer that question we need some basis for making the judgment. The\nDSM, as we have seen, states that we have such a basis; mental disorder\nis an outward sign of dysfunction. But to make that argument, we need a\ncommitment to finding dysfunction somewhere on the basis of the\noutward, observable phenomena. The minimal model can only\nanswer questions about the relationship between membership in a taxon\nand some other variable: it will not explain why the taxon has the\nnature that it has, or why it should be seen as a kind of disorder.\n\n\nDoing that involves not just the empirical study of mental disorder,\nbut a strong interpretation of the medical model, with its commitment\nto a view of disease as not just a syndrome but a destructive process.\nIt is certainly possible to collect data using the DSM concept of\ndepression, especially information about epidemiology and natural\nhistory. In that sense normal medical reasoning can indeed be employed,\nbut much medical reasoning is directed at trying to\nunderstand causes. It is here that we come to the strong\ninterpretation, with its commitment to the idea that a mental disorder,\nlike any other disease, is not just a construct to guide inquiry, but a\ngenuine part of the causal structure of the biological world\u2014a\ndestructive entity with a distinctive pathophysiology which explains\nthe observable phenomena that the minimal model is content with.\n",
