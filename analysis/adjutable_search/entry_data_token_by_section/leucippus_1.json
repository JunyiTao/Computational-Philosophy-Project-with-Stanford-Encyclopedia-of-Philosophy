    "main_text": "Life and Works\n2. Atomist Doctrine\n\nLeucippus is named by most sources as the originator of the theory\nthat the universe consists of two different elements, which he called\n\u2018the full\u2019 or \u2018solid,\u2019 and \u2018the\nempty\u2019 or \u2018void\u2019. Both the void and the solid atoms\nwithin it are thought to be infinite, and between them to constitute\nthe elements of everything. Because little is known of\nLeucippus\u2019 views and his specific contributions to atomist\ntheory, a fuller discussion of the developed atomist doctrine is found\nin the entry for Democritus.\n\nEarly Greek atomism is generally taken to have been formulated in\nresponse to the Eleatic claim that \u2018what is\u2019 must be one\nand unchanging, because any assertion of differentiation or change\nwithin \u2018what is\u2019 involves the assertion of \u2018what is\nnot,\u2019 an unintelligible concept. While Parmenides\u2019\nargument is difficult to interpret, he was understood in antiquity to\nhave forced philosophers after him to explain how change is possible\nwithout supposing that something comes from \u2018what is not,\u2019\ni.e. nothing. Aristotle tells us that Leucippus tried to formulate a\ntheory that is consistent with the evidence of the senses that change\nand motion and a multiplicity of things exists in the world (DK 67A7).\nIn the atomist system, many of the changes we perceive are merely\napparent: the real constituents of being persist unchanged, merely\nrearranging themselves into new combinations that form the world of\nappearance. Like Parmenidean Being, the atoms cannot change or\ndisintegrate into \u2018what is not\u2019 and each is a solid unit;\nnonetheless, the combinations of atoms that form the world of\nappearance continually alter. Aristotle cites an analogy to the\nletters of the alphabet, which can produce a multitude of different\nwords from a few elements in combinations; the differences all stem\nfrom the shape (sch\u00eama) of the letters, as A differs\nfrom N; by their arrangement (taxis), as AN differs from NA;\nand by their positional orientation (thesis), as N differs\nfrom Z (DK 67A6).\n\nLeucippus also reportedly accepted the Eleatic Melissus\u2019\nargument that void is necessary for motion, but took this to be\nevidence that, since we experience motion, there must be void (DK\n67A7). The reason for positing smallest indivisible magnitudes is also\nreported to be a response to Zeno\u2019s paradoxes that arise from\nassuming magnitudes are infinitely divisible (DK 29A22). Leucippus is\nreported to hold that the atoms are always in motion (DK 67A18).\nAristotle criticizes him for not offering an account that says not\nonly why a particular atom is moving (because it collided with\nanother) but why there is motion at all. Because the atoms are\nindestructible and unchangeable, their properties presumably stay the\nsame through all time.\n\nAs Diogenes Laertius reports Leucippus\u2019 cosmology, worlds or\nkosmoi are formed when groups of atoms combine to form a\ncosmic whirl, which causes the atoms to separate out and sort by like\nkind. A sort of membrane of atoms forms out of the circling atoms,\nenclosing others within it, and creating pressure by whirling. The\nouter membrane continually acquires other atoms from outside when it\ncontacts them, which get ignited as they revolve and form the stars,\nwith the sun in the outermost circle. Worlds are formed, grow and\nperish, according to a kind of necessity (DK 67A1).\n\nOne direct quotation preserved from Leucippus says that nothing\nhappens in vain (mat\u00ean) but everything from\nlogos and by necessity (DK 67B2). This has been found\npuzzling, since the reference to logos might seem to suggest\nthat things are ruled by reason, an idea that Democritus\u2019 system\nexcludes. Either Leucippus\u2019 system is different in this respect\nfrom that of Democritus, or the reference to logos here\ncannot be to a controlling mind. Barnes takes there to be no grounds\nfor preferring either interpretation (Barnes 1984), but Taylor argues\nthat Leucippus\u2019 position is that an account (or logos)\ncan be given of the causes of all occurrences (Taylor 1999, p. 189).\nThere is nothing in other reports to suggest that Leucippus endorsed\nthe idea of a universal intelligence governing events.\n\nAristotle frequently pairs Leucippus and Democritus in his reports,\nincluding his account of the motivation for positing atoms and void.\nIn particular, Aristotle associates Leucippus as well as Democritus\nwith the deliberately paradoxical assertion that \u2018being is no\nmore than not-being,\u2019 i.e., that void exists as much as the full\nor solid (DK 67A6). Schofield (2002) has argued that the more careful\naccount in Simplicius shows that the ou mallon or \u2018no\nmore\u2019 doctrine is due to Democritus. Following this lead, Graham\n(2008) suggests a new reading of Leucippus, wherein the distinction\nbetween atom and void is actually based on a reading of\nParmenides\u2019 Doxa, his cosmological account. Rather than logical\nabstractions, Being and Not-being, Leucippus\u2019 atoms would in\nessence be based on Parmenides\u2019 cosmological contraries, night\nand light. If this line of interpretation is followed,\nLeucippus\u2019 notion of atom and void might have been rather\ndifferent from Democritus\u2019, and Aristotle\u2019s tendency to\nrefer to the two in conjunction somewhat misleading.\n",
