    "main_text": "Future Contingents || Chatton\u2019s Anti-Fatalist Argument\n6.2 Chatton\u2019s Anti-Fatalist Argument\n\nI present the first part of his solution as an annotated argument.\nFirst, we should state the fatalist argument generally. For any\ncontingent object \\(a\\) we have:\n\nNecessarily (IF God knows that \\(a\\) will be THEN \\(a\\) will\nbe).\nNecessarily God knows that \\(a\\) will be.\nNecessarily \\(a\\) will be.\n\n\nOr, in modern notation:\n\n\\(\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)\\)\n\\(\\Box p\\)\n\\(\\Box q\\)\n\n\nThis argument is clearly valid by application of the K-axiom and modus\nponens, i.e., by the K-axiom we can go from the necessity of the\nconsequence, \\(\\Box(p\\rightarrow q)\\), to the necessity of both parts,\n\\(\\Box p\\rightarrow \\Box q\\), and then we just apply modus ponens at\nline\n (2).[9]\n\nChatton rebuts this argument by denying the second premise. He claims\nthat when \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 names a contingent thing, the sentence\n\u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 is contingent, not\nnecessary. His counter-argument is based on two pieces of\nphilosophical analysis (premises 1 and 4 below), and a theory of\nequivalence (premise 7):\n\nTo assert a sentence of the form \u2018\\(a\\) will be\u2019\nreally means either to assert: (i) that \u2018\\(a\\) will be\u2019 is\ntrue, or (ii) that \u2018\\(a\\) is\u2019 will be true. These two\nexpositions are non-equivalent, since one can be true while the other\nis false. [Explicit premise. Chatton claims to borrow this analysis\nfrom an opinion that was making the rounds at Oxford when he studied\nthere.]\nIf \\(a\\) names a contingent thing, then option (i) is right out,\nsince this would entail that there is no reason to take trouble about\nthe future. [Explicit premise. Chatton draws the fatalistic inference\nfrom option (i) and thereby rejects that option.]\nTherefore, option (ii) holds: if \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 names a\ncontingent thing in \u2018\\(a\\) will be\u2019, we must understand\nthe sentence \u2018\\(a\\) will be\u2019 to be equivalent to the\nfollowing contingent sentence \u2018\u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d\nwill be true\u2019. [From 1 and 2. \u2018\u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will\nbe true\u2019 must be contingent, because otherwise it is no\ndifferent in meaning or fatalistic consequences from option (i).]\nFrom now on let \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 name a contingent thing. Now,\nthe sentence \u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019, properly\nexposited, is equivalent to this conjunction: \u2018God knows \\(a\\)\nAND \\(a\\) will be\u2019. [Explicit premise. This analysis is\nChatton\u2019s original contribution.]\nTherefore the following expository equivalences hold: \u2018God\nknows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 = \u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \\(a\\)\nwill be\u2019 = \u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d\nwill be true\u2019. [From 3 and 4.]\n\u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will be\ntrue\u2019 has a contingent conjunct, namely the second conjunct.\n[From 3.]\nWhen a proposition is exposited by a conjunction, if one of the\nconjuncts of the exposition is contingent, the original proposition is\nas well. [Implicit premise.]\n\u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 is contingent. [From 5,\n6, and 7.]\n\n\nTo sum up, the first part of Chatton\u2019s response comes to\nthis:\n\n\u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 is equivalent to the\nconjunction \u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will be\ntrue\u2019.\nThe sentence \u2018God knows \\(a\\)\u2019 is of course necessary,\nbut \u2018\u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will be true\u2019 is contingent,\ntherefore the conjunction of the two sentences is contingent.\nTherefore, since \u2018God knows that \\(a\\) will be\u2019 is\nequivalent to a contingent sentence, it is itself contingent.\n\n\nTwo remarks need to be made. First, premise 4 seems to have originated\nwith Chatton, and he was followed in this by the next generation of\nOxford theologians, for example, Robert\n Holcot.[10]\n Second, even if we accept this argument, Chatton still owes us an\nexplanation of what the first conjunct means in the\nconjunction \u2018God knows \\(a\\) AND \u201c\\(a\\) is\u201d will be\ntrue\u2019. On the assumption that \\(a\\) is a contingent future\nthing, we can still sensibly ask, how can God possibly know\nthis future contingent \\(a\\)? Chatton admits that this conjunct is\nnecessary, but this fact, together with the firmness of divine\nknowledge, seems to violate our sense of \\(a\\)\u2019s contingency; it\nseems we can just raise the problem of future contingents all over\nagain, focusing on the left-hand conjunct. There is yet another\nproblem. Does the fact that God knows contingent \\(a\\) entail that his\nknowledge changes when \\(a\\) comes into existence in time?\nFortunately, Chatton is aware of these difficulties and tries to solve\nthem by distinguishing God\u2019s knowing a thing from his\ncognizing it.\n",
