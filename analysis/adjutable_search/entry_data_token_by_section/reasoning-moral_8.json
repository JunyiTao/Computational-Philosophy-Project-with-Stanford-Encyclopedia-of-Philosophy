In addition, of course, these\nsituations will also present us with a lot of information that is not\nmorally relevant. On any realistic account, a central task of moral\nreasoning is to sort out relevant considerations from irrelevant ones,\nas well as to determine which are especially relevant and which only\nslightly so. That a certain woman is Sartre\u2019s student\u2019s\nmother seems arguably to be a morally relevant fact; what\nabout the fact (supposing it is one) that she has no other children to\ntake care of her? Addressing the task of sorting what is morally\nrelevant from what is not, some philosophers have offered general\naccounts of moral relevant features. Others have given accounts of how\nwe sort out which of the relevant features are most relevant,\na process of thinking that sometimes goes by the name of\n\u201ccasuistry.\u201d\n\nBefore we look at ways of sorting out which features are morally\nrelevant or most morally relevant, it may be useful to note a\nprior step taken by some casuists, which was to attempt to set out a\nschema that would capture all of the features of an action or\nproposed action. The Roman Catholic casuists of the middle ages did so\nby drawing on Aristotle\u2019s categories. Accordingly, they asked,\nwhere, when, why, how, by what means, to whom, or by whom the action\nin question is to be done or avoided (see Jonsen and Toulmin 1988).\nThe idea was that complete answers to these questions would contain\nall of the features of the action, of which the morally relevant ones\nwould be a subset. Although metaphysically uninteresting, the idea of\nattempting to list all of an action\u2019s features in this way\nrepresents a distinctive \u2013 and extreme \u2013 heuristic for\nmoral reasoning. \n\nTurning to the morally relevant features, one of the most developed\naccounts is Bernard Gert\u2019s. He develops a list of features\nrelevant to whether the violation of a moral rule should be generally\nallowed. Given the designed function of Gert\u2019s list, it is\nnatural that most of his morally relevant features make reference to\nthe set of moral rules he defended. Accordingly, some of Gert\u2019s\ndistinctions between dimensions of relevant features reflect\ncontroversial stances in moral theory. For example, one of the\ndimensions is whether \u201cthe violation [is] done intentionally or\nonly knowingly\u201d (Gert 1998, 234) \u2013 a distinction that\nthose who reject the doctrine of double effect would not find\nrelevant. \n\nIn deliberating about what we ought, morally, to do, we also often\nattempt to figure out which considerations are most relevant.\nTo take an issue mentioned above: Are surrogate motherhood contracts\nmore akin to agreements with babysitters (clearly acceptable) or to\nagreements with prostitutes (not clearly so)? That is, which feature\nof surrogate motherhood is more relevant: that it involves a contract\nfor child-care services or that it involves payment for the intimate\nuse of the body? Both in such relatively novel cases and in more\nfamiliar ones, reasoning by analogy plays a large role in ordinary\nmoral thinking. When this reasoning by analogy starts to become\nsystematic \u2013 a social achievement that requires some historical\nstability and reflectiveness about what are taken to be moral norms\n\u2013 it begins to exploit comparison to cases that are\n\u201cparadigmatic,\u201d in the sense of being taken as settled.\nWithin such a stable background, a system of casuistry can develop\nthat lends some order to the appeal to analogous cases. To use an\nanalogy: the availability of a widely accepted and systematic set of\nanalogies and the availability of what are taken to be moral norms may\nstand to one another as chicken does to egg: each may be an\nindispensable moment in the genesis of the other. \n\nCasuistry, thus understood, is an indispensable aid to moral\nreasoning. At least, that it is would follow from conjoining two\nfeatures of the human moral situation mentioned above: the\nmultifariousness of moral considerations that arise in particular\ncases and the need and possibility for employing moral principles in\nsound moral reasoning. We require moral judgment, not simply a\ndeductive application of principles or a particularist bottom-line\nintuition about what we should do. This judgment must be responsible\nto moral principles yet cannot be straightforwardly derived from them.\nAccordingly, our moral judgment is greatly aided if it is able to rest\non the sort of heuristic support that casuistry offers. Thinking\nthrough which of two analogous cases provides a better key to\nunderstanding the case at hand is a useful way of organizing our moral\nreasoning, and one on which we must continue to depend. If we lack the\nkind of broad consensus on a set of paradigm cases on which the\nRenaissance Catholic or Talmudic casuists could draw, our casuistic\nefforts will necessarily be more controversial and tentative than\ntheirs; but we are not wholly without settled cases from which to\nwork. Indeed, as Jonsen and Toulmin suggest at the outset of their\nthorough explanation and defense of casuistry, the depth of\ndisagreement about moral theories that characterizes a pluralist\nsociety may leave us having to rest comparatively more weight\non the cases about which we can find agreement than did the classic\ncasuists (Jonsen and Toulmin 1988). \n\nDespite the long history of casuistry, there is little that can\nusefully be said about how one ought to reason about competing\nanalogies. In the law, where previous cases have precedential\nimportance, more can be said. As Sunstein notes (Sunstein 1996, chap.\n3), the law deals with particular cases, which are always\n\u201cpotentially distinguishable\u201d (72); yet the law also\nimposes \u201ca requirement of practical consistency\u201d (67).\nThis combination of features makes reasoning by analogy particularly\ninfluential in the law, for one must decide whether a given case is\nmore like one set of precedents or more like another. Since the law\nmust proceed even within a pluralist society such as ours, Sunstein\nargues, we see that analogical reasoning can go forward on the basis\nof \u201cincompletely theorized judgments\u201d or of what Rawls\ncalls an \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d (Rawls 1996). That is,\nalthough a robust use of analogous cases depends, as we have noted, on\nsome shared background agreement, this agreement need not extend to\nall matters or all levels of individuals\u2019 moral thinking.\nAccordingly, although in a pluralist society we may lack the kind of\ncomprehensive normative agreement that made the high casuistry of\nRenaissance Christianity possible, the path of the law suggests that\nnormatively forceful, case-based, analogical reasoning can still go\non. A modern, competing approach to case-based or precedent-respecting\nreasoning has been developed by John F. Horty (2016). On Horty\u2019s\napproach, which builds on the default logic developed in (Horty 2012),\nthe body of precedent systematically shifts the weights of the reasons\narising in a new case.\n\nReasoning by appeal to cases is also a favorite mode of some recent\nmoral philosophers. Since our focus here is not on the methods of\nmoral theory, we do not need to go into any detail in comparing\ndifferent ways in which philosophers wield cases for and against\nalternative moral theories. There is, however, an important and\nbroadly applicable point worth making about ordinary reasoning by\nreference to cases that emerges most clearly from the philosophical\nuse of such reasoning. Philosophers often feel free to imagine cases,\noften quite unlikely ones, in order to attempt to isolate relevant\ndifferences. An infamous example is a pair of cases offered by James\nRachels to cast doubt on the moral significance of the distinction\nbetween killing and letting die, here slightly redescribed. In both\ncases, there is at the outset a boy in a bathtub and a greedy older\ncousin downstairs who will inherit the family manse if and only if the\nboy predeceases him (Rachels 1975). In Case A, the cousin hears a\nthump, runs up to find the boy unconscious in the bath, and reaches\nout to turn on the tap so that the water will rise up to drown the\nboy. In Case B, the cousin hears a thump, runs up to find the boy\nunconscious in the bath with the water running, and decides to sit\nback and do nothing until the boy drowns. Since there is surely no\nmoral difference between these cases, Rachels argued, the general\ndistinction between killing and letting die is undercut. \u201cNot so\nfast!\u201d is the well-justified reaction (cf. Beauchamp 1979). Just\nbecause a factor is morally relevant in a certain way in comparing one\npair of cases does not mean that it either is or must be relevant in\nthe same way or to the same degree when comparing other cases. Shelly\nKagan has dubbed the failure to take account of this fact of\ncontextual interaction when wielding comparison cases the\n\u201cadditive fallacy\u201d (1988). Kagan concludes from this that\nthe reasoning of moral theorists must depend upon some theory that\nhelps us anticipate and account for ways in which factors will\ninteract in various contexts. A parallel lesson, reinforcing what we\nhave already observed in connection with casuistry proper, would apply\nfor moral reasoning in general: reasoning from cases must at least\nimplicitly rely upon a set of organizing judgments or beliefs, of a\nkind that would, on some understandings, count as a moral\n\u201ctheory.\u201d If this is correct, it provides another kind of\nreason to think that moral considerations could be crystallized into\nprinciples that make manifest the organizing structure involved. \n",
