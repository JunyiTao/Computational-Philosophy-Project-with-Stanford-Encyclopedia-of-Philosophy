    "main_text": "The Soul\n7. The Soul\n\nWilliam\u2019s treatise On the Soul is one of the most\nsubstantial Latin works on the topic from before the middle of the\nthirteenth century. Although William begins this treatise with\nAristotle\u2019s definition of the soul as the perfection of an\norganic body potentially having life, his conception of the soul is\nheavily influenced by Avicenna and decidedly Platonic in character. He\ninterprets Aristotle\u2019s definition to mean that the body is an\ninstrument of the soul (as he thinks the term \u201corganic\u201d\nindicates) and that \u201ca body potentially having life\u201d must\nrefer to a corpse, since a body prior to death actually has life. And\nalthough he calls a soul, with Aristotle, a form, unlike Aristotle he\nholds that a soul is in fact a substance, something individual,\nsingular and a \u201cthis something\u201d (hoc aliquid),\nnot at all dependent on the body for its existence.\n\nWilliam adopts the standard view that souls serve to vivify or give\nlife to bodies, and thus he posits not just souls of human beings\n(i.e., rational souls), but also those of plants and animals\n(vegetative and sensitive souls respectively), as they all have living\nbodies. But in the case of the human soul, William also identifies the\nsoul with the human being, the referent of the pronoun\n\u201cI.\u201d\n",
