    "main_text": "Piron\u2019s Theorem || Conditioning and the Covering Law\n5.1 Conditioning and the Covering Law\n\nLet us call a complete orthomodular lattice satisfying the hypotheses\nof Piron\u2019s theorem a Piron lattice. Can we give any\ngeneral reason for supposing that the logic/property lattice of a\nphysical system (one for which these are isomorphic) is a Piron\nlattice? Or, failing this, can we at least ascribe some clear physical\ncontent to these assumptions? The atomicity of \\(L\\) follows if we\nassume that every pure state represents a \u201cphysical\nproperty\u201d. This is a strong assumption, but its content seems\nclear enough. Irreducibility is usually regarded as a benign\nassumption, in that a reducible system can be decomposed into its\nirreducible parts, to each of which Piron\u2019s Theorem applies.\n\nThe covering law presents a more delicate problem. While it is\nprobably safe to say that no simple and entirely compelling argument\nhas been given for assuming its general validity, Piron [1964, 1976]\nand others (e.g., Beltrametti and Cassinelli [1981] and Guz [1978])\nhave derived the covering law from assumptions about the way in which\nmeasurement results warrant inference from an initial state to a final\nstate. Here is a brief sketch of how this argument goes. Suppose that\nthere is some reasonable way to define, for an initial state \\(q\\) of\nthe system, represented by an atom of the logic/property lattice\n\\(L\\), a final state \\(\\phi_p (q)\\)\u2014either another atom, or\nperhaps 0\u2014conditional on the proposition \\(p\\) having been\nconfirmed. Various arguments can be adduced suggesting that the only\nreasonable candidate for such a mapping is the Sasaki\nprojection \\(\\phi_p : L \\rightarrow L\\), defined by\n\n\\(\\phi_p (q) = (q \\vee p') \\wedge\n p\\).[18]\n\nIt can be shown that an atomic OML satisfies the atomic covering law\njust in case Sasaki projections take atoms again to atoms, or to 0.\nAnother interesting view of the covering law is developed by Cohen and\nSvetlichny [1987].\n",
