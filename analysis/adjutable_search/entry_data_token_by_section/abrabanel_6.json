Medieval Aristotelians tended to locate rhetoric in\nthe trivium (which also included logic and dialectic), and,\nthus, as propaedeutic to \u201chigher\u201d sciences such as\nmetaphysics. In the Renaissance, however, eloquence was equated\nwith wisdom, and the good rhetorician had to be proficient in all\nbranches of human knowledge. This led many Jewish Renaissance\nthinkers to examine not only the classical authors (e.g., Cicero and\nQuintilian), but also to mine the Bible for its use of language and\nstyle. Whereas Maimonides and other Jewish Aristotelians had been\ninterested in biblical rhetoric as a means to reproduce imaginative\nrepresentations of philosophical truths to those unlearned in\nphilosophy, Renaissance thinkers held that rhetoric was the art form\npar excellence, one that enabled the individual to command\nrespect in public\n life.[23]\n\n\nFurthermore, following Maimonides (e.g., Guide I.2), many\nmedieval thinkers envisaged beauty as contingent upon consensus and not\na matter of the intellectual faculty. In the Renaissance, by\ncontrast, beauty was elevated to an ideal that, inter alia,\nmoved the intellect, by means of desire, to either perfect that which\nexists below it or to be perfected by that above.  This principle\nwas subsequently shared by philosophers, poets, and visual artists,\nand, quite frequently, there existed a fluid line separating these\nprofessions.\n\nThis elevation of rhetoric and aesthetics in the Renaissance led to a\nsubsequent interest in the imagination, a faculty frequently\nmistrusted, but often deemed necessary to medieval political\nphilosophy. Mistrusted because, following Plato\u2019s critique, the\nimagination had the power to deceive and distort; yet, at the same\ntime necessary because the imagination was the defining element of\nprophecy. (In medieval Aristotelianism, the prophet was regarded as a\nperfect philosopher with a perfected imaginative faculty to coin\nimages for the uneducated masses.)  Only now, because Judah was not\nparticularly concerned with philosophical esotericism, the products of\nthe imagination, i.e., images, were not to be appreciated on a\npedagogical level alone, but more importantly on an aesthetic\none. Following Ficino, Judah argues that the artist\u2014more\nspecifically, the artist\u2019s imagination\u2014becomes the vessel\nthrough which God \n speaks.[24]\n",
