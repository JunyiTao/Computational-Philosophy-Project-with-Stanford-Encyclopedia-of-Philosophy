    "main_text": "(Neo)-Russellian Challenges || The Dominant Cause Challenge\n2.2 The Dominant Cause Challenge\n\nMany paradigmatically causal claims relate one cause (or at most a\nvery small set of causal factors) to an effect. Often discussed\nexamples in the literature include \u201cthe short circuit caused the\nfire\u201d or \u201cSuzy\u2019s throwing the rock caused the window\nto break\u201d. If one takes it to be an essential characteristic of\ncausal claims that they involve only a small set of fairly localized\ncausally relevant factors\u2014what Norton calls \u201cthe dominant\ncauses\u201d (Norton 2003: 17)\u2014acting along clearly\ndistinguishable causal routes, then this gives rise to the following\nargument against the applicability of causal notions in physics (Field\n2003).\n\nIf we assume that a system is governed by deterministic physical laws,\nthen the laws allow us to derive the occurrence of some event E\nfrom appropriate initial and boundary conditions. What combination of\ninitial and boundary conditions are required depends on the type of\nmathematical equation that express the laws. In the case of hyperbolic\nequations, such as the wave equation, we can formulate a pure initial\nvalue problem. In this case, the event E occurring at spatial\nlocation x and time \\(t_1\\) is derivable from an earlier state\nS specified on a complete initial value surface in a region\nsurrounding x at time \\(t_0.\\) What is important is that\nnothing less than a complete specification of the state on the initial\nvalue surface will allow E to be derived from the\nlaws\u2014the laws are silent on how a system with incompletely\nspecified initial conditions may evolve. That is, (a) we need to\nspecify the initial state in the relevant region completely and in\nwhatever detail the laws at issue require; and (b) the relevant region\ncomprising the initial value surface may be quite large. In the case\nof relativistic theories initial value surfaces consist of entire\ncross sections of the backward lightcone of E. (The backward\nlightcone consists of those events from which a signal traveling at\nmost at the speed of light could reach E.) In the case of\nclassical Newtonian theories, which allow for signals propagating at\narbitrarily high speeds, S would have to amount to the state of\nthe entire universe at some time \\(t_0\\) prior to E.\n\nIn his seminal article (1912), Russell uses similar considerations to\nargue that the causal law \u201csame cause, same effect\u201d is\neither trivial or false: if the cause of an event E is taken to\ninclude less than a complete specification of all the putatively\ncausal factors relevant to the E\u2019s occurrence, then the\nlaw is false, since then the occurrence of E could then still\nbe disrupted by some external influence not captured within the\nspecification of the set of E\u2019s causes. But once the\nstate S on an initial value surface is fully specified in\nsufficient detail including the entire environment of E, this\nstate will generally be so complex that it is highly likely that a\nstate of exactly this kind will never again occur in the history of\nthe universe. That is, true causal regularities of the form\n\u201cwhenever S is instantiated E will occur\u201d\nwill be instantiated at most once.\n\nWhat, then, is the cause of an event E? It is not enough for\ndefenders of causation simply to give up the principle \u201csame\ncause, same effect\u201d. The challenge, according to the\ndominant cause argument, is to find a criterion that somehow\nallows us to distill a small set of causes from the complete goings-on\non an initial value surface S. And causal skeptics argue that\nphysical theories themselves cannot provide such a criterion. If\ncauses determine their effects, nothing short of the complete state on\nS will classify as the cause or the set of causes of E.\nThis leaves three options, all of which may seem unpalatable for a\ndefender of causation in physics.\n\nEither we take the entire state on S to be the single cause of\nE. But then causes will in general be highly non-localized\nevents. Or we allow for a very large and potentially infinite set of\ncauses of E at all times t prior to E. But then\nwe have given up on the idea that it is part of the concept of cause\nto single out a small set of factors as being responsible for an\nevent. Or, finally, we concede that whatever considerations allow us\nto single out a small set of factors come from outside of physics. But\nthen, it seems, we have to concede that causal notions do not play a\nrole within physics proper. Isolating a small set of factors as\nthe causes or the dominant causes of an event presupposes a\ndistinction between causes and background conditions. For example, we\nmight take the short-circuit to be a cause of the fire, relegating the\npresence of oxygen and of flammable materials and the prevailing\nmeteorological conditions to the background conditions. Yet, the\nargument claims, such a distinction cannot be drawn on purely physical\ngrounds. Any reason for singling out the short circuit goes beyond a\npurely physical description of the situation and must be driven by\nadding context-dependent or pragmatic considerations.\n\nThe dominant cause challenge can be raised both as part of the\ndescriptive project and as part of the functional project. Within the\ndescriptive project the claim is that it is part of our commonsense\nnotion of causation that events only have a small number of causes.\nWithin the functional project the claim becomes that singling out a\nsmall set of events as an event\u2019s causes serves important\npurposes in our cognitive architecture that would not be fulfilled by\nany notion of cause allowing for an event to have an arbitrarily large\nset of causes. This claim might be supported by pointing out that\ncausal claims are used to assign responsibility or blame, to single\nout factors that are particularly amenable to interventions into a\nsystem and for control, or to single out factors that we may find\nparticularly salient in a given context\u2014functions that all\nappear to require zeroing in on only a small number of dominant\nfactors as an event\u2019s causes.\n\nIn response to the dominant cause challenge one can argue that (either\ndescriptively or functionally) we ought to distinguish between more\nstrongly pragmatic causal notions and an objective\u2014or at least\nless context-dependent\u2014core concept of causation. The fact that\na small set of particularly salient or explanatorily relevant causal\nfactors, in a given context, are often singled out as the\ncauses of an event points to a pragmatic dimension of causal talk. Yet\nthis is compatible with allowing for much more complex and\nfine-grained underlying structures, which are causal in a\nnon-pragmatic (or at least less pragmatic) sense of\n\u201ccause\u201d. Our physical theories, according to this view,\ndescribe an arbitrarily complex and appropriately objective causal\nweb, yet in any given explanatory context only an extremely small\nsubset of the web\u2019s nodes is singled out as pragmatically\nsalient causes.\n\nWithin the descriptive project the reply would have to argue that our\ncommonsense concept of cause is multidimensional in this sense. Within\nthe functional project, the reply could concede that focusing on a\nsmall set of causal factors fulfills certain pragmatic and context\ndependent roles yet maintain that these are not the only functions of\ncausal concepts and causal judgements and that there are other\nfunctions that are compatible with\u2014or even require\u2014a\nbroader notion of what counts as an event\u2019s causes.\n",
