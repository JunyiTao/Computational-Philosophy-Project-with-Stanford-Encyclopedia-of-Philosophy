Unity of Science and the Encyclopedia Model\n\nEarly in his intellectual life, at the turn of the twentieth century,\nNeurath was acquainted with at least four recent images and projects\nof unification of the sciences: (1) The scholastic (Llull) and\nrationalist (Leibniz) tradition of an ideal universal language and\ncalculus of reasoning; (2) the Neo-Kantians\u2019distinction between\nthe Naturwissenschaften and the\nGeisteswissenschaften; (3) Wundt\u2019s comprehensive\nlogical viewpoints associated with different sciences, or perspectival\nmonism; and (4) the Monist movement more generally, with figures such\nas Ernst Haeckel and Wilhelm Ostwald that included the project of\nenergetics, with Mach\u2019s related bio-economic, neutral monism of\nelementary sensations. Subsequently, throughout the 1910s, Neurath\nengaged four connected debates: (1) The debate over the Neo-Kantian\ndivide between natural and human, or cultural, sciences; (2) the\ndebate over the distinctive role of value judgment in the social\nsciences; (3) the debate over the scope and validity of concepts and\nlaws in economics; and (4) the debate over the possibility of history\nas a positive science.\n\nIn the Vienna Circle\u2019s manifesto (1929), Neurath ushered in and\nextolled a scientistic turn in philosophy he labelled the scientific\nworld-conception. Beyond the intellectual, he added, \u2018the\nscientific world-conception serves life and life receives\nit\u2019 (Carnap, Hahn and Neurath 1929/1973, 306, orig. ital.).\nHere the project of logical empiricism gets its Enlightenment\ndimension, with the old reforming, constructive and universalist\nambitions, but with new and revised ideas and ideals of society,\nscience and rationality (Uebel 1998). Neurath continued to maintain\nthe view that, as predictive tools, all sciences are \u2018aids to\ncreative life\u2019 (Neurath 1931/1973, 319), alongside his view of\nthe complexity of life, e.g., the earthly plane of the empirical world\nthat includes the human, private and social. It cannot surprise, then,\nthat in this new transformative joint philosophical-social project he\nwould urge that \u2018the goal ahead is unified\nscience\u2019 (Carnap, Hahn and Neurath 1929/1973, 306, orig.\nital.). Like science itself, unified science straddles any divide\nbetween theory and action, the world of physical objects and the world\nof social objectives, past and future, empirical reality and human\nrealization. It is unity of science at the point of action (Cartwright\net al 1991, Cartwright et al. 1996 and Cat et al.\n1996, O\u2019Neill 2003).\n\nNeurath illustrated the fact that the holistic argument for\nunification from the complexity of life generalizes Duhem\u2019s\nholistic argument about prediction and testing with the example of a\nforest fire:\n\n\nCertainly, different kinds of laws can be distinguished from each\nother: for example, chemical, biological or sociological laws;\nhowever, it can not be said of a prediction of a concrete\nindividual process that it depend on one definite kind of law\nonly. For example, whether a forest will burn down at a certain\nlocation on earth depends as much on the weather as on whether human\nintervention takes place or not. This intervention, however, can only\nbe predicted if one knows the laws of human behaviour. That is,\nunder certain circumstances, it must be possible to connect all kinds\nof laws with each other. Therefore all laws, whether chemical,\nclimatological or sociological, must be conceived as parts of a\nsystem, namely of unified science. (Neurath 1931/1983, 59, orig.\nitals.)\n\n\nLaws of one kind may apply nicely to systems, phenomena or events\npurely of one kind, but such things are not concrete individuals in\nthe real world. We may think of them as useful models or abstractions;\nreality behaves more like them only in controlled settings, the\noutcome of engineering, of planned design and construction, that is,\nthe materialized form of abstraction. Idealizations, like ideal types,\ndangerously assume real separability between properties (Neurath\n1941/1983, 225). In this sense, necessary experimentation for the\npurpose of prediction and testing that control is key to observation\nand in turn observation controls theory. In general, from that point\nof view, exactness and scope requires the possibility of composing\nmodels, laws and sciences of different kinds. Science at the point of\naction is unified science.\n\nNeurath\u2019s philosophical contributions to logical empiricism\nappear now more distinctly motivated and more clearly understood: It\nis to serve the valuable goal of unified science, within science,\nphilosophy and society, that Neurath conceived the stress on two\nfurther epistemological aims, namely, the role of collective efforts\nand finally, by implication, intersubjectivity (ibid.). The\nargument from holism would in turn meet the requirements of the\ndemarcation against metaphysics, since metaphysical terms and\nmetaphysicians divide, whereas scientific terms and scientists unite.\nThe boat images further illustrated Neurath\u2019s aim of unity,\nwithin its proper epistemological framework: as a historically\nsituated, non-foundational and collective enterprise. Science is a\nmodel and a resource for society and society is in turn a model and\nresource for science.\n\nIn the context and the phase of the rise of logical empiricism,\nNeurath\u2019s arguments took a general intellectual formulation and\napplication, with references to precedents from intellectual history\nsuch as Leibniz and L\u2019Encyclop\u00e9die (see SCIENTIFIC\nUNITY), and an institutional expression in the form of the planned\nunity of science movement, with its different institutions (Institute\nof Unified Science), events (International Congresses for the Unity of\nScience) and publications (International Encyclopedia of Unified\nScience) (Neurath 1937a/1983, Reisch 1994, Symons et al. 2011).\n\nWhat are the model and mode of unity? What is the alternative they\noppose? Despite popular approaches suggesting a hierarchical, or\npyramidal, structure, which he associated with, among others, Comte,\nOstwald and then Carnap (in the Aufbau and in his subsequent\ndoctrine of physicalism), Neurath opposed the ideal of\n\u2018pyramidism\u2019 and a \u2018system-model\u2019: an\naxiomatic, precisely and deductively closed and complete hierarchy of\nconceptually pure, distinct and fixed sciences. He also dismissed the\nidea of ONE method and ONE ideal language, for instance, mathematics\nor physics, followed by all the other sciences (Neurath 1936/1983 and\nNeurath 1937b/1983). Since 1910 Neurath\u2019s approach to the issue\nwas thoroughly antireductionist: cognitively, logically and\npragmatically. Each science would fail to deal with the connections to\nothers (Neurath 1910/2004). In particular, electron talk, Neurath\ninsisted, is irrelevant to understanding and predicting the complex\nbehavior of social groups.\n\nThe imperative of unity required that \u2018it must be possible to\nconnect each law with every other law under certain circumstances, in\norder to obtain new formulations\u2019 (Neurath 1931/1983, 59).\nInstead of the system-model, he proposed a weaker, dynamical and local\nmodel of integration he called the \u2018encyclopedia-model\u2019: a\nmore or less coherent totality of scientific statements at a given\ntime, in flux, incomplete, with linguistic imprecisions and logical\nindeterminacy and gaps, unified linguistically by the universal jargon\nof physicalist language (not Carnap\u2019s physicalism)\u2014a\nmixture of \u2018cluster\u2019 and \u2018formula\u2019\u2014, the\ncooperative and empiricist spirit, and the acceptance of a number of\nmethods or techniques (probability, statistics, etc), all providing\n\u2018cross-connections\u2019 (Neurath 1936/1983, 145\u2013158 and\n213\u2013229). The evolution of the sciences could be said to proceed\nfrom encyclopedias to encyclopedias (a model weaker and more\npluralistic than those based on Kuhn\u2019s paradigms and\nFoucault\u2019s epist\u00e8mes, but closer to\nCarnap\u2019s later notion of linguistic frameworks; from this\nperspective, it seems less paradoxical that Carnap published\nKuhn\u2019s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in the\nlast volume of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science).\nNeurath spoke of a \u2018mosaic\u2019, an \u2018aggregation\u2019,\nan interdisciplinary \u2018orchestration\u2019 of the sciences as\n\u2018systematisation from below\u2019 rather than a \u2018system\nfrom above\u2019, especially, after World War II, carefully excluding\nany form of \u2018authoritative integration\u2019, even favoring\n\u2018cooperation in fruitful discussion\u2019 to a socialist, Nazi\nor totalitarian-sounding talk of a \u2018programme\u2019 (Neurath\n1936/1983 and Neurath 1946/1983, 230\u2013242). Correspondingly, his\nlater political writings emphasized internationalism, democracy and\nplurality of institutional loyalties.\n\nThe disciplinary dismissal of philosophy, especially its talk of\ntranscendental entities that make up metaphysical doctrines, hardly\nrecommend calling Neurath\u2019s views a philosophy. At the same\ntime, his emphasis on science was coached in a framework that\nconnected thought and action. One may speak of a program.\nNeurath\u2019s program was intended to be and was pluralistic and\n\u2018aggregational\u2019 through and through, semantically,\ntheoretically, disciplinarily, educationally, socially,\npolitically.\n",
