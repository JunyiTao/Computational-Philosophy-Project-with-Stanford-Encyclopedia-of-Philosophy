    "main_text": "Core Principles || Other Mereological Concepts\n2.2 Other Mereological Concepts\n\nIt is convenient at this point to introduce some degree of\nformalization. This avoids ambiguities stemming from ordinary language\nand facilitates comparisons and developments. For definiteness, we\nassume here a standard first-order language with identity, supplied\nwith a distinguished binary predicate constant, \u2018P\u2019, to be\ninterpreted as the parthood\n relation.[6]\n Taking the underlying logic to be the classical predicate calculus\nwith\n identity,[7]\n the requisites on parthood discussed in Section 2.1 may then be\nregarded as forming a first-order theory characterized by the\nfollowing proper axioms for \u2018P\u2019:\n\n\n(P.1)\nReflexivity\n\nPxx \n\n(P.2)\nTransitivity\n\n(Pxy \u2227 Pyz) \u2192 Pxz  \n\n(P.3)\nAntisymmetry\n\n(Pxy \u2227 Pyx) \u2192 x=y.\n\n\n\n(Here and in the following we simplify notation by dropping all\ninitial universal quantifiers. Unless otherwise specified, all\nformulas are to be understood as universally closed.) We may call such\na theory Core Mereology\u2014M for\n short[8]\u2014since\n it represents the common starting point of all standard theories.\n\nGiven (P.1)\u2013(P.3), a number of additional mereological\npredicates can be introduced by definition. For example:\n\n\n(19)\nEquality\n\nEQxy =df Pxy \u2227 Pyx \n\n\n(20)\nProper Parthood\n\nPPxy =df Pxy \u2227\n\u00acx=y \n\n(21)\nProper Extension\n\nPExy =df Pyx \u2227\n\u00acx=y \n\n(22)\nOverlap\n\nOxy =df \u2203z(Pzx \u2227\nPzy) \n\n(23)\nUnderlap\n\nUxy =df \u2203z(Pxz \u2227\nPyz). \n\n\nAn intuitive model for these relations, with \u2018P\u2019\ninterpreted as spatial inclusion, is given in Figure 1.\n\n\nFigure 1. Basic patterns of mereological relations.\n(Shaded cells indicate parthood).\n\n\nNote that \u2018Uxy\u2019 is bound to hold if one assumes\nthe existence of a \u201cuniversal entity\u201d of which everything\nis part. Conversely, \u2018Oxy\u2019 would always hold if\none assumed the existence of a \u201cnull item\u201d that is part of\neverything. Both assumptions, however, are controversial and we shall\ncome back to them below.\n\nNote also that the definitions imply (by pure logic) that EQ, O, and U\nare all reflexive and symmetric; in addition, EQ is also\ntransitive\u2014an equivalence relation. By contrast, PP and PE are\nirreflexive and asymmetric, and it follows from (P.2) that both are\nalso transitive\u2014so they are strict partial orderings. Since the\nfollowing biconditional is also a straightforward consequence of the\naxioms (specifically, of P.1),\n\n\n(24)\nPxy \u2194 (PPxy \u2228 x=y),\n \n\n\nit should now be obvious that one could in fact use proper parthood as\nan alternative starting point for the development of classical\nmereology, using the right-hand side of (24) as a definiens for\n\u2018P\u2019. This is, for instance, the option followed in Simons\n(1987), as also in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s original theory (1916),\nwhere the partial ordering axioms for \u2018P\u2019 are replaced by\nthe strict ordering axioms for\n \u2018PP\u2019.[9]\n Ditto for \u2018PE\u2019, which was in fact the primitive relation\nin Whitehead's (1919) semi-formal treatment of the mereology of events\n(and which is just the converse of \u2018PP\u2019). Other options\nare in principle possible, too. For example, Goodman (1951) used\n\u2018O\u2019 as a primitive and Leonard and Goodman (1940) used its\n opposite:[10]\n\n\n(25)\nDisjointness\n\nDxy =df \u00acOxy. \n\n\nHowever, the relations corresponding to such predicates are strictly\nweaker than PP and PE and no biconditional is provable in\nM that would yield a corresponding definiens of\n\u2018P\u2019 (though one could define \u2018P\u2019 in terms of\n\u2018O\u2019 or \u2018D\u2019 in the presence of further axioms;\nsee below ad (61)). Thus, other things being equal,\n\u2018P\u2019, \u2018PP\u2019, and \u2018PE\u2019 appear to be\nthe only reasonable options. Here we shall stick to \u2018P\u2019,\nreferring to J. Parsons (2014) for further discussion.\n\nFinally, note that identity could itself be introduced by definition,\ndue to the following obvious consequence of the antisymmetry postulate\n(P.3):\n\n\n(26)\nx=y \u2194 EQxy.  \n\n\nAccordingly, theory M could be formulated in a pure\nfirst-order language by assuming (P.1) and (P.2) and replacing (P.3)\nwith the following variant of the Leibniz axiom schema for identity\n(where \u03c6 is any formula in the language):\n\n\n(P.3\u2032)\nIndiscernibility\n\nEQxy \u2192 (\u03c6x \u2194 \u03c6y). \n\n\n\nOne may in fact argue on these grounds that the parthood relation is\nin some sense conceptually prior to the identity relation (as in\nSharvy 1983: 234), and since \u2018EQ\u2019 is not definable in\nterms of \u2018PP\u2019 or \u2018PE\u2019 alone except in the\npresence of stronger axioms (see below ad (27)), the argument\nwould also provide evidence in favor of \u2018P\u2019 as the most\nfundamental primitive. As we shall see in Section 3.2, however, the\nlink between parthood and identity is philosophically problematic. In\norder not to compromise our exposition, we shall therefore keep to a\nlanguage containing both \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018=\u2019 as\nprimitives. This will also be convenient in view of the previous\nremarks concerning the controversial status of Antisymmetry, on which\n(26) depends.\n\nThe last remark is also relevant to the definition of \u2018PP\u2019\ngiven above. That is the classical definition used by Le\u015bniewski\nand by Leonard and Goodman and corresponds verbatim to the intuitive\ncharacterization of proper parthood used in the previous section.\nHowever, in some treatments (including earlier versions of this\n entry[11]),\n \u2018PP\u2019 is defined directly in terms of \u2018P\u2019,\nwithout using identity, as per the following variant of (20):\n\n\n(20\u2032)\n(Strict) Proper Parthood\n\nPPxy =df Pxy \u2227 \u00acPyx.\n \n\n\n(See e.g. Goodman 1951: 35; Eberle 1967: 272; Simons 1991a: 286;\nCasati and Varzi 1999: 36; Niebergall 2011: 274). Similarly for\n\u2018PE\u2019. In M the difference is immaterial,\nsince the relevant definientia are provably equivalent. But the\nequivalence in question depends crucially on Antisymmetry. Absent\n(P.3), the second definition is strictly stronger: any two things that\nare mutually P-related would count as proper parts of each other\naccording to (20) but not, obviously, according to (20\u2032), which\nforces PP to be asymmetric. Indeed, in the presence of (P.1) and (P.2)\nthe latter definition is still strong enough to deliver a strict\npartial ordering, whereas (20) does not even yield a transitive\nrelation unless (P.3) is\n assumed.[12]\n Another important difference is that, absent (P.3), the biconditional\nin (24) continues to hold only if \u2018PP\u2019 is defined as in\n(20); if (20\u2032) is used instead, the left-to-right direction\nfails whenever x and y are distinct mutual parts. In\nview of the above remarks concerning the doubtful status of (P.3), it\nis therefore convenient to work with the weaker definition. Standardly\nit makes no difference, but some of the definitions and results\npresented below would not extend to non-well-founded mereology if\n(20\u2032) were used instead. (See e.g. Cotnoir 2010 and Gilmore\n2016.) Furthermore, since both definitions force PP to be irreflexive,\nit should be noted that the only way to develop a non-well-founded\nmereology that allows for strict mereological loops, i.e., things that\nare proper part of themselves, is to rely on yet another definition or\nelse take \u2018PP\u2019 as a primitive (as in Cotnoir and Bacon\n2012, where PP is axiomatized as transitive but neither irreflexive\nnor asymmetric).\n",
