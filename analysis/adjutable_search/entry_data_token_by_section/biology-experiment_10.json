    "main_text": "Experimental Artifacts and Data Reliability || Robustness\n5.2 The Vera Causa Ideal\n\nRecent scholarship has defended the traditional ideal of vera causa\nboth as a normatively adequate methodological standard for\nexperimental biology as well as a standard that biologists are\nactually committed to. The ideal requires that scientific explanations\nof a phenomenon cite true causes or verae causae. To qualify as a true\ncause, an entity must satisfy the following criteria (e.g., Hodge\n1992): First, it must have been shown to exist. Second, it must be\ncausally competent to produce the phenomenon in question. Third, it\nmust be causally responsible for this phenomenon. Importantly, the\nevidence for existence must be independent from the evidence for\ncausal competence. Thus, the mere fact that an entity\u2019s\npurported causal capacities are able to explain a phenomenon dies not\nalone constitute sufficient evidence for its existence. What this\nmeans, obviously, is that an inference to the best explanation (IBE)\nof a phenomenon cannot alone justify acceptance of a postulated\nentity. It must always be accompanied by independent evidence for\nexistence.\n\nProponents of the vera causa ideal thus oppose the idea that IBE might\nbe something like a common methodological standard for metaphysics and\nfor science. If metaphysicians rely on IBE to justify the entities\nthey postulate, for examples, tropes or substances (as argued by Paul\n2012), they do not hold these beliefs to the same methodological\nstandard as scientists do (Novick forthcoming). For scientists are not\ncontent with IBE-type arguments; they require something more before\nthey accept theoretical entities.\n\nAn example for the vera causa ideal at work can be found in the\nhistory of genetics. In the 19th Century, there was much speculation\nabout hereditary particles. For example, Darwin\u2019s\n\u201cprovisional hypothesis of pangenesis\u201d postulated freely\ncirculating particles or \u201cgemmules\u201d that represented the\nparts and organs of an organism and transmitted this information to\nsubsequent generations. While Darwin was himself an advocate of the\nvera causa ideal, which he meticulously applied to his theory of\nnatural selection, he held this \u201cprovisional hypothesis\u201d\nto less exacting standards (Stanford 2006). However, of course others\ncriticized the pangenesis theory for its failure to meet the vera\ncausa standard, because the gemmules were only inferred on the grounds\nthat they could explain certain hereditary phenomena.\n\nAs Novick and Scholl (forthcoming) show, a science of genetics that\nmet the vera causa standard eventually emerged in the 20th century, in\nthe wake of the re-discovery of Mendel\u2019s laws as well as\nimproved microscopic and cytological techniques. The latter were\nimportant, because they allowed independent checks of the structures\nthat were invoked in order to explain the observed experimental\nregularities. A case in point is Thomas Hunt Morgan\u2019s and his\nco-workers\u2019 \u201cproof\u201d of the hypothesis that genes are\nparts of chromosomes (Bridges 2014). \n\nMorgan et al.\u2019s argument made use of a phenomenon that is called\nchromosomal non-disjunction. This term designates the failure of\nsister chromosomes to segregate during the process of meiosis. A\npossible result of this failure in Drosophila is a fly that has two\nfemale sex chromosomes in addition to a male one (XXY). The\ngeneticists noticed that this would explain why some flies failed to\nexhibit an inheritance pattern normally exhibited by traits that are\ndetermined by sex-linked factors (i.e., factors that lie on one of the\nsex chromosomes X or Y), namely \u201ccriss-cross\u201d inheritance.\nIn this pattern, a recessive trait such as white eye color is\ntransmitted from the females of the first generation to the males in\nthe second generation, while the females revert to the original state\nof red eyes, hence the expression \u201ccriss-cross\u201d. This\nnormal pattern is explained by the fact that a recessive X-linked\ntrait is always expressed in a male because there is only copy of the\ncorresponding gene in a male. The female offspring, by contrast,\nreceive a normal copy of the gene from their father, which is why the\nrecessive trait will be hidden.\n\nIn non-disjunction, some of the offspring carry an extra X in addition\nto the male Y chromosome. This obliterates the criss-cross\nmechanism.\n\nMorgan and his group were adamant that neither the phenomenon of\nsex-linked inheritance nor the fact that non-disjunction would explain\nthe observed deviations from this inheritance pattern were sufficient\nto prove the chromosome theory. A necessary element in their case was\nthe cytology: The excessive X-chromosome was microscopically\nobservable, and it was shown to be present exactly in those flies that\nfailed to exhibit the criss-cross pattern. This is how the vera causa\nideal was met: The chromosomes as carriers of the genes not only\nexplained the phenomena, their existence was also supported by\nevidence other than the fact that they explained the phenomena.\nThat\u2019s how they earned their place in biology\u2019s\nontology.\n\nThe vera causa ideal may also have been effective in the historical\nepisodes presented in previous sections. In the oxidative\nphosphorylation case, the hypothetical chemical intermediate was never\naccepted because biochemists failed to isolate and detect it.\nMitchell\u2019s chemi-osmotic gradient, by contrast, was readily\naccepted. However, it\u2019s causal efficacy in powering\nphosphorylation was doubted. This is where the Racker-Stoeckenius came\nin: By demonstrating this causal efficacy, it completed the case for\nchemiosmotic coupling in compliance with the vera causa ideal.\n\nIn a similar way, it can be argued that Meselson\u2019s and\nStahl\u2019s evidence for semi-conservative replication was\nincomplete. The distribution of DNA in the density gradient supported\nsemi-conservative replication by IBE, but before the identity of the\nthe DNA molecules was confirmed the case was inconclusive, which is\nwhy Meselson and Stahl were so cautious.\n",
