    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nDeductivism is a philosophy of mathematics that was popular in the\nlate nineteenth and early twentieth century. It understands a\nmathematical sentence \\(s\\) as expressing the claim that \\(s\\)\ndeductively follows from appropriate axioms. For instance,\ndeductivists might construe \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d as\n\n\nthe sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d deductively follows from the\naxioms of arithmetic,\n\n\nor \u201c2 is prime\u201d as\n\n\nthe sentence \u201c2 is prime\u201d deductively follows from the\naxioms of arithmetic,\n\n\nor, for a non-arithmetical example, \u201cevery group \\(G\\) has\nexactly one identity element\u201d as\n\n\nthe sentence \u201cevery group \\(G\\) has exactly one identity\nelement\u201d deductively follows from the axioms of group\ntheory.\n\n\nDeductivists thus reject the surface syntax of mathematics. They do\nnot take \u201c2 is prime\u201d to attribute a property (primeness)\nto an entity (the number 2); for them, it states that the sentence\n\u201c2 is prime\u201d follows from some axioms.\n\nThis entry will assess deductivism\u2019s strengths and weaknesses,\ndiscuss its turn-of-the-twentieth-century heyday, and compare it to\ncontemporary versions of structuralism.\n",
