    "main_text": "Psychology || Estimation\n5.1 Estimation\n\nAvicenna had argued in his On the Soul (the De anima\npart of The Healing I.5 and IV.3) that human beings and\nanimals share an internal sense called estimation (wahm,\naestimatio), which perceives so-called\n\u201cintentions\u201d (ma\u02bf\u0101nin,\nintentiones) in an object, such as hostility and\nfriendliness: The sheep perceives hostility in the wolf and judges\nthat the wolf is to be fled from. The basic ingredients of this theory\nwere adopted by many scholastic writers. There was disagreement,\nhowever, over several issues: Firstly, Averroes and Thomas Aquinas (in\ncontrast to Avicenna, Albertus Magnus and others) argued that\nestimation existed in animals only, but not in human beings. To\nexplain instinctive reactions in human beings, it is not necessary,\nthey argue, to assume the existence of a faculty besides the\ncogitative faculty, or ratio particularis, as Thomas calls it\n(Summa theologiae Ia 81.3c). Secondly, scholastic writers\nwere divided over whether the intentions are perceived in the object,\nas Avicenna and Thomas Aquinas say (cf. also John Blund, Tractatus\nde anima, ch. 19), or abstracted from sensory forms, as for\ninstance Albertus Magnus and John Buridan argue (Albertus, De\nanima II.4.7; Buridan, Quaestiones de anima II.22)\n(Black 2000; Hasse 2000, 141\u2013153; cf. also Black 2011). Thirdly,\nthere was disagreement about the notion of \u201canimal\njudgement\u201d propagated by Avicenna. Nominalists such as Adam\nWodeham argue that judgements always involve the formation of a\ncomplex sentence, which presupposes linguistic capabilities; animals,\ntherefore, never truly judge (Perler 2006).\n",
