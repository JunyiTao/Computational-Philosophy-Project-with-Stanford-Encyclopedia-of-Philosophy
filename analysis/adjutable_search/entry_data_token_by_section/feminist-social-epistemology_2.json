    "main_text": "Social Models of Knowers || Differentiated Knowers and Standpoint Theory\n2.1 Differentiated Knowers and Standpoint Theory\n\n\nAt the core of many the feminist discussions of knowers is the idea\nthat experiential differences lead to differences in perspective, and\nthese perspectival differences carry epistemic consequences. At first,\nthis suggestion may appear epistemically innocuous. Even a staunch\nsupporter of the atomistic view can acknowledge that we don\u2019t all share\nthe same experiences, and if one is an empiricist, holding that one\nobtains knowledge primarily through experience, one can acknowledge\nthat different experiences will lead to different knowledge bases. But\nfor the atomist, this point is not epistemically interesting, because a\ndifferent knower could know the same thing as another if she\nwere to have the particular experience in question. In this\nsense, knowers are interchangeable for the atomist. Feminists who argue\nfor the epistemic relevance of the identity of knowers, however, are\ninterested in forms of knowing for which it is questionable whether a\ndifferently located knower could have the same experience. To\ngive an obvious example, sex-specific bodily experiences, such as\nknowing pain during childbirth, cannot be accessed by members of the\nother sex. Feminists arguing for differentiated knowers expand this\nidea, suggesting that there is a vast range of experiences\ndifferentiated along the lines of social location. In a\ngender-structured society, for example, a girl\u2019s experience in math\nclass might differ significantly from her male counterpart\u2019s\nexperience. The differences in knowers that feminists attend to are not\nrandom or idiosyncratic, but are socially structured and systematic,\nwith the potential to be major influences on people\u2019s lives. The\nfeminist arguments that gender is an epistemically relevant category of\nsocial location apply only as long as the society under consideration\nis structured along the lines of gender.\n\n\nWhat makes these feminist arguments interesting is that they do more\nthan argue for a direct link between having a certain experience and\nobtaining a certain piece of knowledge (though they include such cases\nin their analyses too). The intervening concept is that of perspective.\nIf social location shapes one\u2019s perspective on the world (through\ndifferential experiences) and we can only interact with the world and\nknow it through that perspective, then the areas of knowledge for which\none\u2019s social location is relevant may be very broad indeed, and may\ninclude areas of knowledge not obviously connected to the experiences\nof a particular social location. According to these arguments, one\u2019s\nperspective both shapes and sets limits on how a particularly located\nindividual can know, at least through her own achievements. Such\narguments also suggest that institutions of knowledge production that\nare dominated by a particular group may be influenced by the\nperspective of that group, without that perspective being recognized.\nFor example, many who argue that the underrepresentation of women in\nscience is a concern do so not simply from the belief that women should\nbe afforded equal opportunities, but also out of a worry that the\nscience might be shaped by a dominant masculine perspective (Addelson\n1983; Keller 1985; Lloyd 1984), making the underrepresentation of women\nan epistemic issue as well as a justice issue.\n\n\nFeminist standpoint theory has done the most to articulate the\nimportance of perspectival differences stemming from social location.\nAdopted from elements of Marxist theory, feminist standpoint theory\nalso represents one of the more thorough attempts to ground\nepistemology and, correspondingly, a view of knowers in a social\ntheory.  It ties social location very closely to epistemic position,\narguing that social locations not only vary from an epistemological\npoint of view, but that some social locations offer the potential to\nbe more epistemically reliable than others. According to strands of\nMarxist materialism developed by Georg Luk\u00e1cs, one\u2019s social\nposition with respect to material labor is inversely related to one\u2019s\nepistemic position. Society is structured primarily along the lines of\ntwo classes, the working class (proletariat) and the capitalists (the\nbourgeoisie) who own the means of production. As the privileged class,\nthe capitalists have a motivation to maintain the status quo, and this\ninterest interferes in their ability to understand the exploitation of\nthe working class upon which their capitalist privilege depends. The\nworking class, however, as the socially underprivileged, can achieve a\nricher understanding of social relations; they not only have a\nmotivation to understand the true nature of the exploitation to which\nthey are subject (in order to be able to end to the exploitation), but\ntheir position offers the potential for a dual vision. Since they are\nsubject to the rules of the capitalists who wield social power, the\nworking class has an understanding of the capitalists\u2019 view of the\nworld. But additionally, they have an experiential understanding of\ntheir own lives as the exploited. Thus, their position as socially\nunderprivileged affords them the possibility of an epistemic privilege\nstemming from this dual vision. \n\n\nEarly feminist standpoint theory draws on these ideas, but rests on a sexual\ndivision of labor rather than class divisions. Sociologist Dorothy\nSmith argues for the epistemic advantage women sociologists have over\nmale sociologists in their experience of a \u201cbifurcated\nconsciousness\u201d, caught as they are between the conceptual world\nof sociology and the material world of their lives as women (Smith\n1974). Nancy Hartsock\u2019s 1983 articulation of the theory argues that\nwomen\u2019s contributions to subsistence and childrearing result in a\nsystematic difference of experience across the genders. Accordingly,\nthe activities of women that place them in a socially underprivileged\nposition can form the basis of a privileged epistemic standpoint,\nthrough which a deeper understanding of patriarchal institutions and\nideologies can be reached (Hartsock 1983). For most feminist\nstandpoint theorists, including Hartsock, a standpoint is understood\nas an \u201cachieved stance\u201d and is not just a synonym for a\n\u201cperspective\u201d. The achievement of an epistemically\nprivileged standpoint involves a political engagement that makes clear\nto the socially underprivileged the shared nature of their experiences\nof oppression and reveals the systematic structure of power\nrelations. \n\n\nFeminist standpoint theories have developed substantially over the\nyears, especially in response to feminist theorists\u2019 recognition that\ngender cannot be understood in isolation from other social\ncategories. For example, the highly influential work of Patricia Hill\nCollins puts forth the idea of a black women\u2019s standpoint, identifying\nspecific epistemic resources in black women\u2019s experience that are\nimportant to the development of black feminist thought (Collins\n1990). Recognizing the intersection of many axes of oppression,\nfeminist standpoint theorists have had to reconceptualize the idea of\nthe margins and move away from the original Marxian standpoint premise\nof a bifurcated society. As bell hooks has articulated, the margins\nmust be recognized as both sites of oppression and resistance (hooks\n1990). If this is the case, then the Marxian requirement that the\nepistemic privilege of the oppressed must stem from their being\npositioned as the inverse of the dominant in a bifurcated system, is\nmistaken. The oppressed can gain epistemic privilege through their\nresistance, without relying on the idea that they complete the system\nof power by being positioned as both marginal and central the system\u2019s\nfunctioning (Tanesini 1999).\n\n\nFeminist standpoint theories have been controversial because by\nconnecting epistemic perspective so closely to one\u2019s material and\nsocial location, they appear to posit chasms between knowers,\nsuggesting knowers are unable to share knowledge across social\nlocations (Nelson 1990; Walby 2001). Versions of standpoint theory\nhave also been criticized for failing to adequately account for\nphenomenon such as internalized oppression, in which the perspective\nof the oppressed is damaged by the forces of oppression and is\nunreliable. For example, feminists have argued that many women who\nblame themselves for their rapes have internalized damaging false\nbeliefs about their responsibilities and the causes of their rapes,\nmaking it problematic to consider their perspective epistemically\nadvantageous or reliable. Some versions of feminist standpoint theory\nhave had difficulty accounting for the coherence of a feminist\nstandpoint while acknowledging that women are variously situated and\ndo not experience gender oppression (or any particular form of\noppression) in the same way. Standpoint theories have also been\ncriticized for valorizing the agency of those in the margins, and the\nsame time as falsely theorizing a single central power in society (Bar\nOn 1993). It has also been important for standpoint theories to\nspecify the scope of their claims.  Claims concerning the epistemic\nsignificance of social location have seemed most plausible for\nunderstanding social relations, and this is certainly the focus of the\noriginal contributions of standpoint theories.  But there may be\nadditional realms of knowledge for which social location is\nsignificant, and social location may not play out in the same way in\nall realms. Alison Wylie has argued that it is a contingent matter,\nopen to empirical investigation, how certain subdominant standpoints\noffer epistemic advantages in particular fields of knowledge\n(2003).\n\n\nLooking back on the developments of standpoint theories, Sandra\nHarding has argued that while they have been the most controversial of\nfeminist epistemologies, they have also been the most productive with\nrespect to their application in research projects across the\ndisciplines (Harding 2009). Harding argues that they offer an\nincredibly effective methodology in the production of sound knowledge\nabout marginalized groups. As a methodology, standpoint theories\ninsist that researchers focus their attention on the standpoints of\nthe underprivileged, striving to understand the world from these\nvantage points, and successfully uncovering a good deal of knowledge\nabout the lives of the underprivileged in the process.\n\n\nUltimately, the plausibility of standpoint theories as epistemologies\ndepends on their specific details, and many versions have developed\nsignificantly since their first articulations. Additionally, many\nfeminist social epistemologists who ultimately reject standpoint\ntheory have adopted some form of the idea that social location is\nconnected to epistemic perspective in significant ways, and hence that\nknowers are differentiated. The controversies evoked by standpoint\ntheories and their criticisms also have stimulated important\ndiscussions concerning how feminist social epistemologists are to\nunderstand the exact nature of the relationship between social\nlocation and epistemic perspective. With such developments, some\nfeminist empiricists such as Kristen Intemann have become interested\nin drawing on the strengths of both empiricism and standpoint theory,\nproposing a merger of the two approaches (Intemann 2010). \n",
