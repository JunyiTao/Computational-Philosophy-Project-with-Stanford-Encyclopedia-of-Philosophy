    "main_text": "The Problem of Race || Ontological Issues\n3.1 Ontological Issues\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed the concept of race, sometimes\nconsidered to be biological or scientific, in the history of thought\nin Latin America. This concept remained influential during the early\ndecades of the twentieth century in the form of a scientific\nracism. However, similarly to what occurred in the discussion of\nthe concept of race more generally (James & Burgos 2020 [2022]), a\nconsensus has also been reached among biologists and philosophers in\nLatin America that rejects the traditional biological concept of race\nand racial naturalism, leading to acceptance of racial\nskepticism. This has been argued at length by biologists, such as\nBrazilian S\u00e9rgio D. J. Pena (2002, 2005, 2008; Pena &\nBirchal 2005\u20132006) and philosophers like Mexican Carlos\nL\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n (2000\u20132001) and Argentine Gustavo\nCaponi (2020), who resides in Brazil.\n\nNonetheless, denying the biological or natural existence of races does\nnot imply denying the existence of a social use of racialized\ncategories and thinking. Indeed, academics accept a kind of racial\nconstructivism, either by affirming that races remain real social\nobjects that were created and exist by means of human culture and\nhuman decisions, or accepting race as an idea that people use to\ncategorize themselves and others through classic racial traits, which\nare typically essentialist in character and refer back to familiar\nracial categories (Wade et al. 2014b).\n\nThe socially attested existence of this idea, which we can call the\nfolk concept of race, and its social use are, of course,\ncompatible with thin constructivism, that is, the idea that\nsuperficial properties are prototypically linked with race. However,\ngiven the real social consequences of the resulting racialization and\nthe enduring presence of racialized categories in government\ninstitutions and public policies, this idea is also compatible with\nso-called interactive constructivism, or individuals who are\nlabeled according to their ascription to a certain racial category and\nhave certain common experiences, and institutional\nconstructivism, which describes race as specific to the society\nin which it is embedded and inapplicable to all cultures or historical\nepochs.\n\nCaponi (2020) analyzes possible explications of the folk concept\nof race made from the population perspective, such as races as\nspecies, subspecies (geographic race) or lineages of populations, and\nas populations (ecological race or ecotype) or sub-lineages of\nsubspecies, and discards them as inadequate. He points out that the\nfundamental difficulty of these attempts lies in the differences\nbetween the typological perspective, which is proper to the notion of\nhuman race, and the population perspective.\n\nMany authors stress the centrality of an individual\u2019s physical\nappearance in racial classification in Latin America, both regarding\nself-identification and hetero-classification (Wade 2017; Kent &\nWade 2015; Nieves Delgado, Garc\u00eda Deister, & L\u00f3pez\nBeltr\u00e1n 2017). Caponi aims to refine this idea by explicating\nthe concept expressed by racial typologies, that is, the folk concept\nof race, and the term \u201crace\u201d itself, through the notion of\nphysiognomic type. Caponi argues that this concept should not\nbe explicated by phenotypes considered in their totality but rather by\nsuperficial morphological aspects and details identifiable to the\nnaked eye, though they may also be detectable by a device or\nmeasurement system. Physiognomic differences exist (e.g., skin color,\nwhich is perhaps socially considered more important in the use of\nracialized categories and racialized thinking), and individuals are\nthereby differentiated from each other, but this does not mean that\nthere are natural or biological races. This demarcation is associated\nwith differences of other kinds, such as class or socioeconomic\nposition, \u201ccultural\u201d or educational level, socially\nacceptable or punishable behaviors, etc. It also entails the social\nprejudices, suspicions, and discriminations that are greater when\nthese physiognomic differences are close to those that were supposed\nto be characteristic of traditional biological or natural racial\ncategories. Thus, even though human races are mere taxonomic fictions\nand, phylogenetically speaking, human races are a myth, the folk\nconcept of race and racialized categories and thinking are not a\nsocial myth; they exist and have very real effects. The question then\narises, entering the normative realm: how socially useful is this\nmethod of classifying humans?\n\nThe answer Caponi (2020) gives contrasts with that given by authors\nlike L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n (2000\u20132001) or Pena (Pena &\nBirchal 2005\u20132006). The latter argue for a normative racial\neliminativism, recommending the complete abolishment of any\nconcept of race or racialized typologies and thinking given that they\nreinforce biological misconceptions and categories on which racism is\nbased. Although Caponi partially share\u2019s Pena\u2019s social\ncontext of Brazil, similar to L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n\u2019s\ncontext of Mexico, he adopts a stance of normative racial\nconservationism. Even though he rejects all forms of racism, as\ndo Pena and L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n, Caponi maintains that in\ncertain contexts, racial categories understood as mere physiognomic\ntypes are functional and may have some epistemic value. One context,\nthough limited, is that of forensic anthropology. Another possible\ncontext, also limited and requiring caution, is that of medicine.\nHowever, physiognomic types do not have the greatest cognitive\nrelevance regarding biological processes but rather social ones. The\nfact that an individual corresponds to one physiognomic type or\nanother may influence the way they insert themself and function within\ncertain contexts and social spaces. In Brazil, for example, given the\nexistence of structural inequalities usually correlated with\nphysiognomic type, some public policies have been proposed and\nimplemented to correct these injustices. As a result, affirmative\naction or the quota system in Brazilian public universities have been\nthe subject of public debate, with the participation of various\ngeneticists, sociologists, anthropologists, educators, and jurists,\namong others (see Kent & Wade 2015; Wade 2017).\n\nFor instance, the geneticist Pena gave evidence on the genetic\nnonexistence of race in the 2010 Supreme Court hearings on the\nconstitutionality of such quotas. This evidence was drawn from his own\nresearch, in which he emphasizes the high levels of genetic diversity\nin Brazil (Pena, Carvalho-Silva, et al; 2000, Parra et al. 2003;\nVentura Santos et al. 2009). In relation to affirmative action\npolicies in general, Pena argues that although they are\nwell-intentioned in promoting necessary social changes, governments\nshould be careful not to provoke artificial and arbitrary tensions and\ndivisions among the people of Brazil (Pena & Birchal\n2005\u20132006). In particular, regarding the system of racial quotas\nin Brazilian public universities, he argues that modern genetics can\nprovide inputs for policy decisions but cannot claim an explicit\nprescriptive role (Pena 2005; Pena & Bortolini 2004; Pena &\nBirchal 2005\u20132006; Birchal & Pena 2011). However, moving\nfrom the field of biological science to the social field, Pena himself\nopposes such a system (which, by the way, was declared constitutional\nby the Brazilian Supreme Court in 2012).\n\nIn contrast, Caponi (2020) considers that, given the fact that races\ndo not exist but individuals with some differentiated physiognomic\ntraits do exist and are thereby discriminated against, affirmative\naction or \u201cpositive discrimination\u201d programs will tend to\ndiminish discrimination against these individuals with these traits by\npromoting them to positions of prestige and power, eroding the very\ncondition of possibility for such discrimination.\n",
