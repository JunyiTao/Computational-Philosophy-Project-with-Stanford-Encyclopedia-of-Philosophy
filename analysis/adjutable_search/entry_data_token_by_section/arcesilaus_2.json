    "main_text": "Criticism of Stoic epistemology\n3. Criticism of Stoic epistemology\n\n\nArcesilaus\u2019 best known arguments, and the only ones that\nsurvive in any detail, are his criticisms of Stoic epistemology (Sextus\nAgainst the Logicians [\u2018M.\u2019]\n7.150\u20139, Cicero Academica 2\npassim, esp. 2.66\u20137 & 2.77).\n\n\nThe Stoic theory of knowledge represented a radical shift in\nepistemology, since it offered an empirically-based route to the kind\nof wisdom Socrates had sought (see Frede 1999). Its basis was three\nnovel claims made by Zeno, the founder of the Stoa (see Cicero\nAcademica 1.40\u20132). First, Zeno proposed a new\npsychological theory: to form a belief of any kind is to give one\u2019s\nassent to one\u2019s \u2018impression\u2019 (or \u2018appearance\u2019:\n\u2018phantasia\u2019 in Greek) about the matter.\nSecondly, he claimed that some of our perceptual impressions are\n\u2018cognitive\u2019 or self-warranting, so that assenting to them\nconstitutes a cognition or apprehension\n(\u2018katal\u00eapsis\u2019) of their objects.\nAnd, thirdly, he argued that we ought to restrict our assent to just\ncognitive impressions, since it is contrary to reason to form\n\u2018opinions\u2019\u2014that is, mere beliefs whether true or\nfalse\u2014by assenting to inadequately warranted, non-cognitive\nimpressions. But, given that there are cognitive impressions, we can\nattain infallible knowledge or wisdom by restricting our assent to\nthem, since our thoughts will then be constituted entirely by\ncognitions derived from perception or from concepts warranted by\nperceptual cognitions.\n\n\nThe focus of Arcesilaus\u2019 attack on Zeno\u2019s theory was its\ncenterpiece, the theory of cognitive impressions. Zeno defined a\ncognitive impression as one that comes from what is, is stamped and\nimpressed exactly in accordance with it, and is such that it could not\nbe false (Sextus M. 7.248, Cicero Academica 2.77).\nThis means, roughly, that an impression is cognitive if and only if\n[a] its propositional content is true, [b] it is caused in the\nappropriate way for correctly representing its object, and [c] its\ntruth is thus warranted by the inimitable richness and detail of the\nrepresentational character guaranteed by its causal history\u2014such\nthat [a] is entailed by [b]. Arcesilaus\u2019 tactic was to grant\nthat conditions [a] and [b] are often met, as Zeno claimed, but to\nargue that condition [c] never obtained (M.\n7.154, Academica 2.77).  Although his detailed arguments for\nthis have not survived, it is fairly clear from later Academic and\nStoic arguments that he followed two main lines of attack. One line\ndepended on the existence of indistinguishable\u2014or, at any rate,\nindiscernibly distinct\u2014objects, such as twins, or pairs of eggs,\nmanufactured items (statues or impressions on wax of the same\nletter-seal), and grains of sand (Academica 2.54\u20138\n& 2.84\u20136, M.  7.408\u201310). Any of these could\nbe mistaken for another no matter how good one\u2019s impression of it\nwas. The second depended on abnormal states of mind, such as dreams,\nillusions, and fits of madness (Academica 2.47\u201353 &\n2.88\u201390, M.  7.402\u20138). In either case, Arcesilaus\nargued that, whether the nature of the objects or of our minds is at\nfault, it is always possible to have a false impression with exactly\nthe same propositional content and representational character as a\ntrue one that meets condition [b]. But if so, no impression can be\nself-warranting in virtue of the way in which its content is\nrepresented. So condition [c] never obtains. Hence, on the Stoic view\nof the requirements for cognition, there is no cognition. And if\nknowledge is derived entirely from perceptual cognition and concepts\nwarranted by it, as Zeno supposed, it follows that nothing can be\nknown. (Intricate Stoic-Academic debates on these issues lasted for\nanother 150 years; they can best be traced through the arguments of\nChrysippus and Carneades, preserved in some detail in\nCicero\u2019s Academica and Sextus M. 7.)\n\n\nThe argument is standardly summarized as follows:\n\nSome impressions are true (a Stoic view).\nFalse impressions are non-cognitive (Zeno\u2019s condition [a]).\nIf the content of a true impression is potentially\nindistinguishable or indiscernible from that of a false impression, it\nis non-cognitive (Zeno\u2019s condition [c]).\nThe content of all true impressions is potentially\nindistinguishable or indiscernible from that of false impressions\n(Arcesilaus\u2019 counterexamples).\nSo, there are no cognitive impressions. (See Academica\n2.40 & 2.83.)\n\n\n\nAnd, since for Zeno knowledge itself depends on assent to cognitive\nimpressions, this argument leads to the further conclusion that nothing\ncan be known (inapprehensibility).\n\n\nArcesilaus followed up this argument against the cognitive\nimpression with a briefer argument against Zeno\u2019s ideal of wisdom:\n\nthere are no cognitive impressions (as Arcesilaus has argued),\n&\nit is irrational to hold \u2018opinions\u2019, i.e., to assent to\nnon-cognitive impressions (as the Stoics held); therefore,\nit is irrational to assent to any impressions at all. (See\nM. 7.155\u20137 & Academica 2.66\u20137.)\n\n\n\nThat is, Arcesilaus pointed out to the Stoics that if his argument\n[1]\u2013[5] against the cognitive\nimpression is successful, they are also committed to the conclusion\nthat it is irrational to assent to anything (universal\nsuspension).\n\n\nThese arguments are presented in two very different ways in our two\nsources. In Sextus\u2019 account (followed above), they are presented\nas explicitly dialectical arguments, relying on clearly marked Stoic\nviews, and leading to the conclusion that the Stoic sage will have no\nbeliefs. In the report of Cicero in Academica 2, however, we\nare informed that Arcesilaus was in some way committed to premises and\nconclusions of both arguments: that is, he agreed that condition [c] of\nthe Stoic definition of the cognitive impression could never be met,\nand hence that nothing can be known; and he maintained premises [5] and\n[6] of the second argument, and hence concluded that assent to any\nimpression was irrational (Academica 2.66\u20137 & 2.77).\nThis historical interpretation of Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism is\nsupported elsewhere in Cicero\u2019s dialogues, where we find histories of\nphilosophy that have Arcesilaus following Socrates and Plato (and\nPresocratic philosophers such as Democritus, Parmenides and Empedocles)\nin concluding that nothing can be known by perception or reason, and\nhence adopting a method of argument that would lead others to refrain\nfrom all assent (De oratore 3.67 &\nAcademica\u00a01.43\u20136; see also Plutarch Against\nColotes 1121f).\n\n\nCicero\u2019s interpretation in Academica 2.66\u20137 &\n2.77 faces two problems. The first is that the argument against the\nexistence of cognitive impressions depends on many facets of the\nepistemological framework of the Stoics. For the conclusion doesn\u2019t\nfollow unless it is true that there are impressions, that some are\ntrue, that there are no other routes to cognition, that the Stoic\ndefinition of cognition gives necessary and sufficient conditions for\nknowledge, etc. And there is reason to doubt Cicero\u2019s testimony that\nArcesilaus subscribed to these Stoic views, since we have some evidence\nthat he argued against every aspect of Stoic epistemology and\npsychology. Plutarch, for instance, mentions an objection to the Stoic\ntheory of the soul\u2019s interaction with the body, which implies that\nArcesilaus argued against the fundamental mechanism of impression in\nZeno\u2019s account (On Common Conceptions 1078c). Another fragment\nfrom Plutarch suggests that Arcesilaus argued against Zeno\u2019s causal\ntheory of perception (Fragment 215a). And Sextus reports that\nArcesilaus also objected to Zeno\u2019s conception of belief as assent to an\nimpression, on the ground that assent is a matter of reason or thought,\nrather than the acceptance of a physiological item, the impression\n(M. 7.154).\n\n\nIn these cases, as with his argument against the satisfiability of\ncondition [c] of the Stoic definition of the cognitive impression, it\nseems possible to trace a definite strategy behind Arcesilaus\u2019\narguments: he argued against Zeno\u2019s empiricist presuppositions by\ndeploying Platonic objections and theories (see Schofield 1999,\nTrabattoni 2005, Vezzoli 2016, and von Staden 1978). One might\nconclude, as some did in antiquity, that Arcesilaus therefore had a\nhidden objective of undermining Stoic or Epicurean empiricism in favor\nof Platonic doctrine (see Sextus Outlines of Pyrrhonism\n1.234). But Arcesilaus\u2019 method implies that he would argue\nagainst Platonic doctrines as well, if anyone proposed them. So if he\ndid hold the view that nothing can be known, it seems more plausible to\nthink that he held it due to the success of his arguments against all\nconceptions of knowledge, rather than solely as the conclusion of an\nargument relying on a particular epistemological theory. Cicero\u2019s\naccount, then, may give only a partial story of the grounds of\nArcesilaus\u2019 skeptical views.\n\n\nThe second problem with the interpretation of Arcesilaus\u2019\nskepticism in Academica 2.66\u20137 & 2.77 is that it\nrisks self-defeat. The problem lies not in knowing that nothing can be\nknown, since, on one account\n(Cicero\u00a0Academica\u00a01.45), Arcesilaus, unlike\nSocrates, explicitly disclaimed such second-order knowledge. It lies\nrather in believing that nothing can be known in conjunction with the\nbelief that it is irrational to hold opinions in the absence of\nknowledge. If the former is true, it is irrational (and so one ought\nnot) to believe the premises of the arguments that support both\ninapprehensibility and universal suspension.\n4. Inapprehensibility and Universal Suspension of Assent\n\n\nThere are two approaches to resolving this second problem, that\naccepting inapprehensibility and universal suspension\nmay be self-defeating. The NRNB view takes a negative route,\ndenying that Arcesilaus was committed to inapprehensibility\nand universal suspension, at least as a prescriptive claim\nabout the irrationality of assent (see [7] in sect. 3). By contrast,\nthe RNB and NRB views positively ascribe\ninapprehensibility and universal suspension to\nArcesilaus, but they maintain that his acceptance of them is not\nexplained in terms of rational belief of the sort which would lead a\nStoic convinced by Arcesilaus to a self-defeating position (see sect.\n2).\n4.1 The Non-Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe NRNB view of Arcesilaus argues that he was not\ncommitted to inapprehensibility and universal\nsuspension, as a prescriptive claim about the\nirrationality of assent (see [7] in sect. 3). On this view, the two\nsources for the anti-Stoic arguments still imply that Arcesilaus was\n\u2018committed\u2019 to universal suspension, but this is\nunderstood as the descriptive claim that the skeptic does not\nassent to anything due to the balance of opposing arguments; and he was\ncommitted to it only in the sense that he acted in accordance with his\nunreflective impressions (see sect. 5.1 below). Thus, there is no\nconflict between the anti-Stoic sources, Sextus and Cicero, and those\nthat report that Arcesilaus\u2019 universal suspension is\ncaused by the equipollence of arguments without mentioning his\ncriticism of Stoic epistemology (viz., Diogenes Laertius 4.28, Cicero\nAcademica 1.45, & Sextus Outlines of Pyrrhonism\n1.232).\n\n\nThis interpretation takes Sextus to imply that Arcesilaus\u2019\ncommitment to a descriptive version of universal suspension is\nprior to his anti-Stoic argument (M. 7.156\u20137),\noutlined above in sect. 3 (see e.g., Ioppolo 2002; 2009). In this\nargument he holds that the Stoic who concedes the non-existence of\ncognitive impressions is forced to conclude that it is rational to\n\u2018withhold assent\u2019 (\u2018asugkatathetein\u2019)\nabout everything (see [10] below). This conclusion is sufficient to\noppose the Stoic thesis that some assents are rational. The full\nversion of the argument outlined in sect. 3 is:\n\nThere are no cognitive impressions, as Arcesilaus has argued.\n\n\nThe wise person does not hold \u2018opinions\u2019, i.e., assent\nto non-cognitive impressions, as the Stoics held.\nTherefore, the wise person does not assent to anything.\nIf one does not to assent to anything, one withholds assent\n(\u2018asugkatathetein\u2019) about everything.\nTo withhold assent is to suspend judgment\n(\u2018epechein\u2019).\nTherefore, the wise person suspends judgment about everything.\n\n\n\nThat Arcesilaus used premise [11] to move from withholding assent to\nthe suspension of judgment (\u2018epoch\u00ea\u2019)\nindicates, on this account, a commitment to epoch\u00ea that\nis independent of Stoic notions like assent and the irrationality of\nholding opinions, because it is reached only through the equipollence\nof arguments.\n\n\nThe NRNB view also interprets Cicero as confirming that\nArcesilaus was committed to the descriptive version of universal\nsuspension, even though Cicero Academica 2.66\u20137\n& 77 reports that Arcesilaus was committed to various components of\nhis anti-Stoic arguments (see sect. 3): that there are no cognitive\nimpressions, that nothing can be known, that it is irrational to hold\nopinions, and that it is rational to suspend assent. Cicero may be\nunreliable here, because he is biased by his own, later conception of\nradical skepticism, and in his text one may yet find an alternative\nview (see Ioppolo 2008): at Academica 2.32, Cicero\u2019s pro-Stoic\ncharacter Lucullus refers to skeptical Academics who concede that\neverything is uncertain (\u2018ad\u00eala\u2019) without\npreferring any views; and these Academics appear to be followers of\nArcesilaus (cf. Academica 2.16 & 59). Since these\nAcademics\u2019 suspension of judgment is based on the notion of\nuncertainty, which is not necessarily Stoic, their skeptical views do\nnot depend on an anti-Stoic critique.\n\n\nHowever, there are strong reasons not to read Sextus and Cicero as\nconfirming that Arcesilaus\u2019 commitment to a descriptive version\nof universal suspension is independent of his anti-Stoic\narguments. Even if Arcesilaus developed a notion of suspension\n(\u2018epoch\u00ea\u2019) before his criticisms of the\nStoa, premise [11] above conceptualizes it in Stoic terms. It is true\nthat Arcesilaus in Sextus M. 7.156\u20137 goes beyond the\npoint sufficient to oppose the Stoic\u2014viz., that the wise person\ndoes not assent to anything (see [9] above). But he continued the\nargument because there is a conceptual difference between not assenting\nand withholding assent (see e.g., Friedman 2013), and because\nepoch\u00ea refers to the latter. Withholding assent\npresupposes a prior examination of evidence and the recognition of an\nequipollence among the reasons for competing beliefs. (See also Maconi\n1988 and B\u00e9natou\u00efl 2011.) As for the evidence of Cicero,\neven if Lucullus thinks Arcesilaus himself belongs to the group of\nAcademics who say that everything is non-evident, he also accuses\nArcesilaus of appealing to the authority of Presocratics to promote his\nview of inapprehensibility, which crucially presupposes Stoic\nconditions on knowledge (Academica 2.15). So even Lucullus\nthinks Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism is related to his anti-Stoic\narguments.\n\n\nThere are further problems with the NRNB view, separate\nfrom the issues of interpretation mentioned above. For one, it narrowly\nrestricts the skeptic to a life of unreflective reaction (see sect.\n5.1), and therefore does not seem compatible with the patterns of\nrationality and inquiry that Arcesilaus engaged with. Its narrow\nrestriction on the scope of skeptical action is also overly dogmatic:\nwere the NRNB view true, it seems implausible Arcesilaus would\nsee the need for a theory of skeptical action, let alone use the\nStoic model of non-rational animals.\n4.2 The Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe RNB view of Arcesilaus denies that his acceptance of\ninapprehensibility and universal suspension is\nexplained in terms of belief in the premises and hence in the\nconclusions of his arguments. Rather, on this account Arcesilaus\nguides his rational activity by something like a supposition or\nhypothesis\u2014a set of notions deployed variously in Plato\u2019s\ndialogues, Theophrastus\u2019 dialectic, and geometrical theory (see\nSchofield 1999 and Thorsrud 2018; cf. B\u00e9natou\u00efl & El\nMurr 2010). Even the Stoics distinguished hypotheticals from\nassertions and arguments, such that one can accept hypotheses and what\nfollows from them without asserting them (see Barnes 1997). Arcesilaus\ncould have adapted this kind of theory to account for the rational\nactivities of the skeptic. Accounts of impression and assent also\nafford a distinction between beliefs and belief-like imaginings such\nas suppositions, which may then take the place of beliefs in chains of\ninference. This distinction allows for a reasoned commitment\nthat falls short of assent (see Striker 1980, Bett 1990, and\nReinhardt 2018). Arcesilaus, on this view, supposes that we ought to\nlive without realist commitments that fix our view of the world. His supposition may have been based on\npremises\u2014some of which he shared with Zeno\u2014as well as on a\ngeneralization from his philosophical experience, after repeatedly\nfinding that rational inquiry does not justify assent.\n\n\nHowever, this proposal must address several problems. For instance,\nit seems doubtful that a rational life can be based on hypotheticals\nwithout a large web of background beliefs (see Frede 1979 and Bett\n1989). Without them, the skeptic seems unable to decide which\nhypotheses to suppose and when to suppose them. And even if such a life\nis possible, it is not clear how it would be practically\ndistinguishable from, and so preferable to, a life based wholly on\nbelief. If the skeptic regards as hypothetical the very same things we\nordinarily believe, then skepticism seems unmotivated. (See Thorsrud\n2010 and Perin 2013 for other objections.) Perhaps one could defend\nthe possibility of a radically skeptical life of this kind by saying\nthat, while its development requires starting with beliefs, over time\nan increasing number of background beliefs may be substituted with\nhypotheses, and that the benefits of the skeptical life are of a\nsecond-order, affecting the ease with which the skeptic can change the\nguiding assumptions of her life.\n4.3 The Non-Rational Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe NRB view instead argues that universal\nsuspension isn\u2019t opposed to beliefs per se, but only to\nbeliefs justified through philosophical theory or reasons generally.\nThe Stoics maintain that the mind is essentially rational, so that its\nassent is necessarily reason-responsive (see Coope 2016).\nArcesilaus\u2019 skepticism, on this view, challenges the rationalist\npresupposition that belief is necessarily and explicitly grounded in\nreason. This doesn\u2019t preclude that Arcesilaus found himself\u2014as\na result of the inadequacy of the arguments for any position, and of\nthe equally convincing arguments against it\u2014with the belief\nthat nothing can be known. Thus, inapprehensibility is neither\nthe conclusion of a deductive argument relying on a theory of knowledge\nor of our cognitive faculties, nor an inductive inference from prior\ninvestigations; it is not a theoretical or even rationally warranted\nbelief, but just the way things strike him (see Cooper 2004 and\nThorsrud 2009).\n\n\nBut in the case of universal suspension, it seems that the\nview that it is irrational to hold unwarranted beliefs is\nheld\u2014at least in part\u2014on the basis of a theoretical belief\nthat knowledge is very important to acquire and that mere belief is to\nbe avoided. Cicero, for instance, stresses that Arcesilaus agreed with\nZeno that it is irrational to hold opinions, i.e., inadequately\nwarranted assents (premise [6] in sect. 3, above); and Sextus suggests\nthat he thought that individual cases of suspended\nbelief\u2014presumably in the light of inconclusive\narguments\u2014were good (Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.233). And\nthe view that it is irrational to hold mere beliefs (that is,\nopinions) depends on a further set of epistemological beliefs about\nthe nature of belief and knowledge. If Arcesilaus was not rationally\ncommitted to any set of assumptions about the nature and requirements\nof rationality or about belief and knowledge\u2014which he ought not\nto be, given that he had argued against the various views on offer,\nand hence, ex hypothesi, suspended belief about them\u2014it\ndoesn\u2019t look like he can believe that one ought not to take beliefs to\nbe justified.\n\n\nThe NRB view thus takes universal\nsuspension to be a belief that is not rationally warranted, as\nwell as the views on which it causally depends. That is, Arcesilaus\nbegan inquiry motivated by a pre-theoretical belief, that philosophical\nknowledge is important and mere belief inadequate. And his repeated and\nextensive investigations left him with the realization that even these\nregulating assumptions of his philosophical practice have failed to be\nwarranted and that no beliefs are justified.\n\n\nOn this view, the radical skeptic has beliefs but doesn\u2019t take them\nto be justified. This proposal raises problems, too (see Burnyeat\n1983). It seems that a large part of being a rational agent is to\nexercise some control over one\u2019s beliefs. Since this control takes the\nform of a responsiveness to reasons, it does not seem possible for\nrational agents to give up practices of justification. A related\nobjection is to maintain that even having beliefs, which involves the\nuse of concepts, is necessarily responsive to reasons (see Williams\n2004). To have a belief, according to this view, requires making a\nconscious inference about the proper use of concepts, and conscious\ninferences are made in virtue of reasons. One may respond that the\nskeptic isn\u2019t precluding herself from a responsiveness to reasons but\nrather lacks confidence in them, and that such rationalist theories of\nagency and belief are stricter even than the Stoics\u2019, against\nwhich Arcesilaus argued (see sect. 5 below).\n5. The practical criterion\n\n\nThe third doctrine we might ascribe to Arcesilaus on the basis of\nhis sources is a so-called practical criterion, i.e., a theory that\nmakes action without assent possible (see [iii] in sect. 2).\n\u00a0Arcesilaus\u2019 argument for a \u2018practical\ncriterion\u2019 responds to two Stoic objections of\n\u2018inaction\u2019 (apraxia). The first, found in\nPlutarch, is that action is impossible without assent, since action is\ncaused by assent to an impression of something suited to the agent\u2019s\nnature, i.e., \u2018oikeion\u2019 (Against\nColotes 1122a\u2013d; cf. Cicero Academica\n2.37\u20138). The second objection, reported by Sextus, is that a good\nor successful life is impossible without assent, since a good life\nrequires action based on knowledge of what is good and bad, and hence\nassent (M. 7.158; cf. Cicero Academica 2.39).\nArcesilaus\u2019 reported replies to these objections are brief, and\naccordingly difficult to interpret (see Bett 1989). His counter to the\nfirst objection is the suggestion that action is possible without\nassent, since even on the Stoic account animal action is triggered\ndirectly by their impressions of something oikeion: the\naddition of assent, and so a belief that the object is in fact\nnaturally suited to the agent, is redundant and liable to be a\ncause of error. In response to the second objection, Arcesilaus argued\nthat the person who suspends assent universally will successfully guide\ntheir actions in light of their sense of what is\n\u2018reasonable\u2019 (\u2018eulogon\u2019).\n\n\nThe three doctrinal interpretations of Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism under consideration take these arguments in Plutarch and Sextus to support, in different ways, their distinct views of his commitment to inapprehensibility and/or universal suspension.\n5.1 The Non-Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n\n\nProponents of the NRNB view take the argument of Plutarch\nto give a general theory of action that supports universal\nsuspension of judgment as a natural reaction to equally balanced\narguments. On this theory all actions are merely impulsive, i.e.,\ncaused just by impressions of what appears suitable\n(\u2018oikeion\u2019). Since the skeptic doesn\u2019t make\njudgments, the only sense in which she is committed to her impressions\nis that she acts on them. It is unclear how this is compatible with the\nevidence of Sextus on \u2018the reasonable\u2019, where the skeptic\nconsiders reasonable justifications in deciding what to do. But some\nadvocates of NRNB combine the two so that a class of impulsive\nactions count as voluntary if, after their performance, one can\nreasonably justify them as successful (e.g., Ioppolo 1981; 1986; 2000).\n\n\nEven allowing for this attenuated sense of the voluntary, it is\nunclear why Arcesilaus would come to accept this impulsivist theory of\naction, if it were true: since\u2014as the theory\nmaintains\u2014theory doesn\u2019t inform action, it is difficult to\nexplain theoretical commitments solely in terms of what appears suited\nto an agent (see Maconi 1988, Trabattoni 2005, and Vezzoli\n2016). An NRNB reading of \u2018the reasonable\u2019\ntherefore concedes that Sextus may have elided important details (see\nIoppolo 2018).\n5.2 The Rational Non-Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe RNB view opens up a more promising way to read the\nbrief counter-arguments in Plutarch and Sextus as a positive theory of\nArcesilaus. His counter in Plutarch is that action isn\u2019t always caused\nby occurrent beliefs\u2014we sometimes act through habit, or by\ninstinct. By itself, this doesn\u2019t go very far, however, since the\nStoics will have objected that, even if this were possible, this\naccount couldn\u2019t describe the voluntary and responsible actions of a\nrational agent. (The Stoics defined responsible or voluntary action in\nterms of assent, since this was the mechanism through which our\nrationality acts on the world.) But one can read the counter-argument\nin Sextus as supplementing that response: there is space for\nrationality and responsibility, on this view, in the production of the\nimpressions or thoughts motivating us when we act. We can act in\naccordance with what strikes us as the reasonable thing to do upon\nreflection, but still refrain from assent, i.e., refrain from forming\nthe belief that this is the right thing to do.\n\n\nThere are two problems facing this interpretation of \u2018the\nreasonable\u2019. The first is that it does not look to be supported\nby the evidence to which it appeals. Sextus, the source for the notion\nof \u2018the reasonable\u2019 as the criterion, says that Arcesilaus\nand his followers did not define a criterion and that, when they\nseemed to, they did so \u201ca counterblast to that of the\nStoics\u201d (M. 7.150, Bury trans.). (Sextus\u2019 later\naccount of Arcesilaus in another work is also incompatible with his\nhypothesizing such a theory; see Outlines of Pyrrhonism\n1.232\u20133.) And Cicero and Numenius, our other sources for the\nview that Arcesilas was committed to inapprehensibility\nand universal suspension, do not mention his adoption of a\npractical criterion\u2014in fact, in both authors it is suggested\nthat Arcesilaus did not offer a position on how one might live without\nassent, and that Carneades significantly revised the Academic position\nin this respect (Academica 2.32; Numenius fr. 27.14\u201332,\ncf.  Numenius fr. 26.107\u201311).\n\n\nThe second problem is that even if the context does not explicitly\ndemand that Arcesilaus\u2019 practical criterion was a dialectical\nploy, the argument Arcesilaus used to support it makes the most sense\nif it is construed dialectically. The argument he gives is something\nlike this (Sextus M. 7.158):\n\na good life depends on practical wisdom;\npractical wisdom consists in a disposition causing right or\nsuccessful actions;\nright or successful actions are those that have a reasonable\ndefense (or justification);\nthe wise person will be guided by what is reasonable;\nhence, the wise person will go right or be successful.\n\n\n\nTwo difficulties face this non-dialectical reading. One is that\nthere is no other evidence that Arcesilaus was committed to premises\n[13] through [16], and they are also ones that Arcesilaus may have\nargued against, since it is reported that he argued not just against\nthe Stoic theory but against all ethical views (Philodemus Index\nAcademicorum 18.40\u201319.9, Diogenes Laertius 7.171, Numenius\nfr. 25.154\u201361, cf. fr. 25.41\u20135).\n\n\nThe second, more pressing difficulty is that, although these premises\nare adapted to the Arcesilean context in which nothing can be known\nand the wise person does not assent to anything, they are manifestly\nvariants of the Stoic theory. The Stoics claimed that a good life is\nthe result of performing \u2018appropriate\nactions\u2019\u2014defined as \u201cthose that, once done, have a\nreasonable defense\u201d\u2014from a disposition of wisdom, i.e.,\nknowledge of what is good, bad and neither. But if nothing can be\nknown, as Arcesilaus has already argued ([5]\u2013[7] in sect. 3,\nabove), the wisdom of the sage consists in not having any\nbeliefs. This disposition will still allow the sage to perform\nappropriate actions, however, if, as the Stoics claim, they are\ndefined by reasonable defenses or justifications. The connection\nbetween performing such actions through a wise disposition and success\nis, Arcesilaus suggests, something that the Stoics can\u2019t deny, because\nthey agree that opinion is the cause of error (this is the\njustification for premise [6] in sect. 3, above).  Hence, the perfect\nexercise of our rationality\u2014reflection without assent, as\nArcesilaus has argued\u2014will lead us to find the action that is\nappropriate to us as rational animals, i.e., the reasonable thing to\ndo, and this guarantees success. Arcesilaus therefore employs the\nStoic definition of appropriate action to defend acting on views that\nare reasonably justified. But, for the Stoics, what is reasonably\njustified is what conforms with the sage\u2019s knowledge of what is\ngood, bad, and neither. Arcesilaus, it seems, cannot borrow his\nopponents\u2019 theory without also accepting the possibility of\nknowledge.\n5.3 The Non-Rational Belief interpretation\n\n\nThe NRB view can instead deny that Arcesilaus was\npersonally committed to defending the life of universal\nsuspension against Stoic counterattack. The Stoics pointed out\nthat Arcesilaus\u2019 subversive argument for the rationality of\nuniversally suspending assent cannot be true, because it makes action,\nor at least rational and virtuous action, impossible\u2014but these\nare plainly possible (cf. Cicero Academica 2.37\u201339). But\neven if this objection did not target his own skeptical view,\nArcesilaus was bound by his method to counter it. Hence it is\nunreasonable to think that he was invested in rationalizing the life of\nthe skeptic with a theory of action (see Stopper 1983; for a\ndifferent view of the polemic, see, e.g., Ioppolo 1986, Maconi 1988,\nand Thorsrud 2009).\n6. Priority of Method\n\n\nSection 2 noted that the central question for the interpretation of\nArcesilaus\u2019 skepticism is how to reconcile his method with his\nskeptical commitments, and sections 4\u20135 set out three accounts of\nhow his commitments are compatible with his method. A further question\nrelates to the purpose of Arcesilaus\u2019 philosophical activity.\nCompeting histories of Arcesilaus\u2019 intentions in Cicero\u2019s\nAcademica offer different answers (see Allen 2018): at one\npoint Cicero suggests that Arcesilaus adopted a Socratic method\nafter he accepted inapprehensibility and\nuniversal suspension, in order to facilitate suspension of\nassent (Academica 1.44\u201345; cf. Sextus Outlines of\nPyrrhonism 1.232); but elsewhere he says that Arcesilaus\u2019\naim in questioning Zeno was to discover the truth (Academica\n2.76; cf. Cicero On the Nature of the Gods 1.11). So\nin question is whether Arcesilaus\u2019  method was\nin the service of inquiry\u2014independently of his commitments to\ninapprehensibility or universal suspension\u2014or\na revival of a Socratic methodology that only reflected skeptical\nconclusions he already reached.\n\n\nAn argument in favor of the latter is as follows (see G\u00f6rler\n1994): if Arcesilaus indeed shared the views that knowledge is\nimpossible and that holding opinions is irrational\u2014as both the\nRNB and NRB interpretations say\u2014then he could\nnot have genuinely been in the business of inquiry, which aims at\nknowledge of the truth; hence the only motivation for dialectical\nargument Arcesilaus might be left with is the promotion of\nuniversal suspension. But this argument ignores the context\nfrom which Arcesilaus\u2019 skeptical views emerged and the effects\nthey could reasonably be expected to have had on his philosophical\npractice.\n\n\nOn the RNB view, the Academic skeptic, at the start of her\nphilosophical career, inherits a rational method of inquiry, as well as\nguiding views about belief and knowledge. But her inheritance is so far\nuntested (at least by her). As she goes about putting it to work, she\nmight at first believe that her method and its norms help her to get at\nthe truth. But she then finds that by arguing in accordance with those\nnorms she is wildly successful at combatting any and all positions. She\ntherefore comes to suppose on rational grounds\u2014which may\ninclude particular arguments against Stoic cognition, the inadequacy of\nall non-skeptical theories of knowledge, and her experiences in\nargument generally\u2014that the norms cannot successfully guide her\nto truths. But she doesn\u2019t quit her life of inquiry because her\nskeptical view of the inadequacy of her method depends on that very\nmethod; it makes little sense for her to act on a view that rejects its\nown grounds. Instead she continues to inquire, now treating her\ninherited norms and guiding views about belief and knowledge only as\nhypotheses rather than as given. On the RNB view, therefore,\nArcesilaus\u2019 skepticism was self-defeating only insofar as it\ncould not justify abandoning reason.\n\n\nA similar story can be told with the NRB view. The skeptic\nlooks for the truth, on the assumption that obtaining it is of crucial\nimportance for her life. But since she consistently fails to find it,\nit begins to strike her that perhaps she never will. Perhaps, it was\nnot, after all, so important for her life to have it: maybe mere\nbelief is all we need. But it doesn\u2019t follow that she should give up\n(as false) her belief that it is irrational to hold opinions, since it\nwould only be correct to give it up if it actually is true that mere\nbelief is all she needs\u2014but this is something that her arguments\ndon\u2019t warrant, any more than they warrant the opposite\nconclusion. An NRB view, then, suggests that\nArcesilaus\u2019 beliefs in the importance of knowledge and the\ninadequacy of opinion were explicitly non-rational, in the sense that\nhe was not persuaded that they were warranted by a rational argument\nor theory, or even by the extensive arguments he devoted his life\nto. He believed that he hadn\u2019t found knowledge and that it is\nirrational to assent to anything without knowledge, but realized, as a\nresult of the unrestricted application of his Socratic method, that\nthere were strong reasons against these beliefs. He was thus not in a\nposition to give his rational assent to the belief that it is\nirrational to hold opinions\u2014he just found that that was how\nthings striked him, i.e., that\u2019s what he believed. The Academic\nskeptic, on this view, is someone whose sustained but pre-theoretical\ncommitment to rational investigation undermines her confidence in\nrationality. The result is not a negative theory\u2014e.g., the\ntheory that we can\u2019t acquire knowledge owing to the limitations of our\ncognitive or rational capacities\u2014but a pervasive lack of theory\nsustained by a dialectical method.\n\n\nIf either of these stories is correct, we don\u2019t need to deny\nArcesilaus seached for the truth, and the basic philosophical puzzle\nabout his radical skepticism is not whether it is possible to live\nwithout rational beliefs, but whether it is possible to be committed to\nrationality and yet sufficiently detached from it to recognise that,\nwhatever it is, it may not work.\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nIt is clear that any interpretation of Arcesilaus must take into\naccount both his reputation as a master dialectician who deployed\nSocrates\u2019 method ruthlessly against his philosophical\ncontemporaries, and his notorious advocacy of\ninapprehensibility and universal suspension. Given\nthe contradictory nature and scarcity of the evidence, it is perhaps\nnot surprising that modern critics do not agree about the success of\nthe \u2018dialectical\u2019 or various \u2018doctrinal\u2019\ninterpretations of Arcesilaus or about the consistency of the very\ndifferent kinds of skepticism the latter propose. But further progress\nis not ruled out, since it is open to us to offer more sophisticated\nphilosophical elaborations of those forms of skepticism and to test\ntheir historical plausibility by appealing to the diverse, but better\nattested traditions in the later Academy.",
