    "main_text": "Constituents of the Social World\n3. Constituents of the Social World\n\nWhat are the parts of a crowd or of a corporation? What are the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for an event to be an animal\nsacrifice? What facts determine that Massachusetts is a state in the\nUnited States?\n\nSome theories strive to give very general answers to questions like\nthese. They aim to fill in for X in the formula: All social\nentities are exhaustively determined by (or are constituted by, or\nsupervene on, or are grounded by, etc.) entities of type X. That\nis, they argue for a particular \u201cdetermination base\u201d for\nthe social entities. A large class of theories fill in \u2018X\u2019\nwith strictly non-social entities. Others argue that this asks too\nmuch: they agree that we can analyze constituents of social entities,\nbut deny that social entities decompose into non-social parts. Still\nothers reject the question altogether. And within all these views a\nvariety of positions are taken on what the \u201cdetermination\u201d\nor building relation is (see\n section 2.3).\n\nOther theories make less ambitious claims. Instead of searching for an\nexhaustive determination base for all social entities, they\nfocus on a particular subset of social entities. Or even more\nmodestly, they aim to analyze certain social entities in terms of\nother social parts\u2014such as a battalion in terms of platoons, or\nan industry in terms of corporations.\n\nMany positions on these matters descend from the debates between\nindividualism versus holism that took place in the early part of the\ntwentieth century (cf. O\u2019Neill 1973, Udehn 2001, Zahle &\nCollin 2014a). Individualism is the somewhat vague thesis that the\nsocial is built exclusively out of individual people. Holism is the\neven vaguer thesis that social entities are \u201csui generis\u201d,\nor ontologically fundamental in some sense. Some recent work aims to\nclarify these (cf. List & Spiekermann 2013, Epstein 2014a, entry on\n methodological holism in the social sciences),\n while some rejects the terms of that debate.\n",
