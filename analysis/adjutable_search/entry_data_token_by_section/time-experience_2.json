    "main_text": "Duration\n3. Duration\n\nOne of the earliest, and most famous, discussions of the nature and\nexperience of time occurs in the autobiographical Confessions\nof St Augustine. Augustine was born in Numidia (now Algeria) in 354\nAD, held chairs in rhetoric at Carthage and Milan, and become Bishop\nof Hippo in 395. He died in 430. As a young adult, he had rejected\nChristianity, but was finally converted at the age of 32. Book XI of\nthe Confessions contains a long and fascinating exploration\nof time, and its relation to God. During the course of it Augustine\nraises the following conundrum: when we say that an event or interval\nof time is short or long, what is it that is being described as of\nshort or long duration? It cannot be what is past, since that has\nceased to be, and what is non-existent cannot presently have any\nproperties, such as being long. But neither can it be what is present,\nfor the present has no duration. (For the reason why the present must\nbe regarded as durationless, see the section on the specious present,\nbelow.) In any case, while an event is still going on, its duration\ncannot be assessed.\n\nAugustine\u2019s answer to this riddle is that what we are measuring,\nwhen we measure the duration of an event or interval of time, is in\nthe memory. From this he derives the radical conclusion that past and\nfuture exist only in the mind. While not following Augustine all the\nway to the mind-dependence of other times, we can concede that the\nperception of temporal duration is crucially bound up with memory. It\nis some feature of our memory of the event (and perhaps specifically\nour memory of the beginning and end of the event) that allows us to\nform a belief about its duration. This process need not be described,\nas Augustine describes it, as a matter of measuring something wholly\nin the mind. Arguably, at least, we are measuring the event or\ninterval itself, a mind-independent item, but doing so by means of\nsome psychological process.\n\nWhatever the process in question is, it seems likely that it is\nintimately connected with what William Friedman (1990) calls\n\u2018time memory\u2019: that is, memory of when some particular\nevent occurred. That there is a close connection here is entailed by\nthe plausible suggestion that we infer (albeit subconsciously) the\nduration of an event, once it has ceased, from information about how\nlong ago the beginning of that event occurred. That is, information\nthat is metrical in nature (e.g. \u2018the burst of sound\nwas very brief\u2019) is derived from tensed information,\nconcerning how far in the past something occurred. The question is how\nwe acquire this tensed information. It may be direct or indirect, a\ncontrast we can illustrate by two models of time memory described by\nFriedman. He calls the first the strength model of time\nmemory. If there is such a thing as a memory trace that persists over\ntime, then we could judge the age of a memory (and therefore how long\nago the event remembered occurred) from the strength of the trace. The\nlonger ago the event, the weaker the trace. This provides a simple and\ndirect means of assessing the duration of an event. Unfortunately, the\ntrace model comes into conflict with a very familiar feature of our\nexperience: that some memories of recent events may fade more quickly\nthan memories of more distant events, especially when those distant\nevents were very salient ones (visiting a rarely seen and frightening\nrelative when one was a child, for instance.) A contrasting account of\ntime memory is the inference model. According to this, the\ntime of an event is not simply read off from some aspect of the memory\nof it, but is inferred from information about relations between the\nevent in question and other events whose date or time is known.\n\nThe inference model may be plausible enough when we are dealing with\ndistant events, but rather less so for much more recent ones. In\naddition, the model posits a rather complex cognitive operation that\nis unlikely to occur in non-human animals, such as the rat. Rats,\nhowever, are rather good at measuring time over short intervals of up\nto a minute, as demonstrated by instrumental conditioning experiments\ninvolving the \u2018free operant procedure\u2019. In this, a given\nresponse (such as depressing a lever) will delay the occurrence of an\nelectric shock by a fixed period of time, such as 40 seconds,\ndescribed as the R-S (response-shock) interval. Eventually, rate of\nresponding tracks the R-S interval, so that the probability of\nresponding increases rapidly as the end of the interval approaches.\n(See Mackintosh 1983 for a discussion of this and related\nexperiments.) It is hard to avoid the inference here that the mere\npassage of time itself is acting as a conditioned stimulus: that the\nrats, to put it in more anthropocentric terms, are successfully\nestimating intervals of time. In this case, the strength model seems\nmore appropriate than the inference model.\n",
