    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || Singular Cardinals\n1.2 Singular Cardinals\nThe case of cardinal arithmetic on singular cardinals is much more\nsubtle. For the sake of completeness we pause to briefly discuss this\nbefore proceeding with the continuum hypothesis. \n It was generally believed that, as in the case for regular\ncardinals, the behaviour of the function\n\u03ba \u21a6 2\u03ba would be relatively unconstrained\nwithin the setting of ZFC. But then Silver proved the following\nremarkable result:[3] \n\nTheorem 1.4 (Silver \n1974). If\n\u2135\u03b4 is a singular cardinal of uncountable\ncofinality, then, if GCH holds below\n\u2135\u03b4, then GCH holds\nat \u2135\u03b4. \nIt turns out that (by a deep result of Magidor, published in 1977)\nGCH can first fail at \u2135\u03c9 (assuming the\nconsistency of a supercompact cardinal). Silver's theorem shows\nthat it cannot first fail at \u2135\u03c91\nand this is provable in ZFC. \n This raises the question of whether one can \u201ccontrol\u201d\nthe size of 2\u2135\u03b4 with a weaker assumption\nthan that \u2135\u03b4 is a singular cardinal of\nuncountable cofinality such that GCH holds below\n\u2135\u03b4. The natural hypothesis to consider is\nthat \u2135\u03b4 is a singular cardinal of uncountable\ncofinality which is a strong limit cardinal, that is, that\nfor all \u03b1 < \u2135\u03b4,\n2\u03b1 < \u2135\u03b4. In 1975\nGalvin and Hajnal proved (among other things) that under this weaker\nassumption there is indeed a bound: \n\nTheorem 1.5 (Galvin and Hajnal\n1975). If\n\u2135\u03b4 is a singular strong limit cardinal of\nuncountable cofinality then\n2\u2135\u03b4 <\n\u2135(|\u03b4|cf(\u03b4))+.\n\nIt is possible that there is a jump\u2014in fact, Woodin showed\n(again assuming large cardinals) that it is possible that for all\n\u03ba, 2\u03ba = \u03ba++. What the above\ntheorem shows is that in ZFC there is a provable bound on how big the\njump can be. \n The next question is whether a similar situation prevails with\nsingular cardinals of countable cofinality. In 1978 Shelah showed that\nthis is indeed the case. To fix ideas let us concentrate on\n\u2135\u03c9. \n\nTheorem 1.6 (Shelah 1978). If\n\u2135\u03c9 is a strong limit cardinal\nthen\n2\u2135\u03c9 <\n\u2135(2\u21350)+.\n\nOne drawback of this result is that the bound is sensitive to the\nactual size of 2\u21350, which can be anything below\n\u2135\u03c9. Remarkably Shelah was later able to\nremedy this with the development of his pcf (possible cofinalities)\ntheory. One very quotable result from this theory is the\nfollowing: \n\nTheorem 1.7\n(Shelah 1982). If\n\u2135\u03c9 is a strong limit cardinal then\n(regardless of the size of\n2\u21350)\n\n2\u2135\u03c9 <\n\u2135\u03c94. \n\n In summary, although the continuum function at regular cardinals\nis relatively unconstrained in ZFC, the continuum function at singular\ncardinals is (provably in ZFC) constrained in significant ways by the\nbehaviour of the continuum function on the smaller cardinals. \nFurther Reading: For more cardinal arithmetic see Jech\n(2003). For more on the case of singular cardinals and pcf theory see\nAbraham & Magidor (2010) and Holz, Steffens & Weitz\n(1999). \n2. Definable Versions of the Continuum Hypothesis and its Negation\nLet us return to the continuum function on regular cardinals and\nconcentrate on the simplest case, the size of\n2\u21350. One of Cantor's original approaches\nto CH was by investigating \u201csimple\u201d sets of real\nnumbers (see Hallett (1984), pp. 3\u20135 and \u00a72.3(b)).  One of the first results in this direction is the\nCantor-Bendixson theorem that every infinite closed set is either\ncountable or contains a perfect subset, in which case it has the same\ncardinality as the set of reals. In other words, CH holds (in this\nformulation) when one restricts one's attention to closed sets\nof reals. In general, questions about \u201cdefinable\u201d sets of\nreals are more tractable than questions about arbitrary sets of reals\nand this suggests looking at definable versions of the continuum\nhypothesis. \n",
