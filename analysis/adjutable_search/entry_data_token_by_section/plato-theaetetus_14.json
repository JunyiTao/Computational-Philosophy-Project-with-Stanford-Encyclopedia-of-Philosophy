To believe or judge falsely is to\njudge, for some two objects O1 and O2, that\nO1 is O2.\n\n\nHow can such confusions even occur? Plato presents a dilemma that\nseems to show that they can\u2019t. The objects of the judgement,\nO1 and O2, must either be known or unknown to the\njudger x. Suppose one of the objects, say O1, is\nunknown to x. In that case, O1 cannot figure in\nx\u2019s thoughts at all, since x can only form\njudgements using objects that he knows. So if O1 is not an\nobject known to x, x cannot make any\njudgement about O1. A fortiori, then, x can\nmake no false judgement about O1 either.\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, both O1 and O2 are known to\nx, then x can perhaps make some judgements\nabout O1 and O2; but not the false judgement that\n\u201cO1 is O2.\u201d If x knows\nO1 and O2, x must know that O1 is\nO1 and O2 is O2, and that it would be a\nconfusion to identify them. So apparently false belief is impossible\nif the judger does not know both O1 and O2; but also\nimpossible if he does know both O1 and O2.  \n\n\nI cannot mistake X for Y unless I am able to\nformulate thoughts about X and Y. But I will not be\nable to formulate thoughts about X and Y unless I am\nacquainted with X and Y. Being acquainted\nwith X and Y means knowing X and\nY; and anyone who knows X and Y will not\nmistake them for each other.\n\n\nWhy think this a genuine puzzle? There seem to be plenty of everyday\ncases where knowing some thing in no way prevents us from sometimes\nmistaking that thing for something else. One example in the dialogue\nitself is at 191b (cp. 144c5). It is perfectly possible for someone\nwho knows Socrates to see Theaetetus in the distance, and wrongly\nthink that Theaetetus is Socrates. The First Puzzle does not even get\noff the ground, unless we can see why our knowledge of X and\nY should guarantee us against mistakes about X and\nY. Who is the puzzle of 188a\u2013c supposed to be a puzzle\nfor?\n\n\nSome authors, such as Bostock, Crombie, McDowell, and White, think\nthat Plato himself is puzzled by this puzzle. Thus Crombie 1963: 111\nthinks that Plato advances the claim that any knowledge at all of an\nobject O is sufficient for infallibility about O\nbecause he fails to see the difference between \u201cbeing acquainted\nwith X\u201d and \u201cbeing familiar with\nX.\u201d But to confuse knowing everything about\nX with knowing enough about X to use the name\n\u2018X\u2019 is really a very simple mistake. Plato would\nnot be much of a philosopher if he made this mistake.\n\n\nIf (as is suggested in e.g. Chappell 2004, ad loc.) 187\u2013201 is an\nindirect demonstration that false belief cannot be explained by\nempiricism (whether this means a developed philosophical theory, or\nthe instinctive empiricism of some people\u2019s common sense), then it is\nlikely that the First Puzzle states the basic difficulty for\nempiricism, to which the other four Puzzles look for alternative\nsolutions. The nature of this basic difficulty is not fully, or indeed\nat all, explained by the First Puzzle. We have to read on and watch\nthe development of the argument of 187\u2013201 to see exactly what the\nproblem is that gives the First Puzzle its bite.\n",
