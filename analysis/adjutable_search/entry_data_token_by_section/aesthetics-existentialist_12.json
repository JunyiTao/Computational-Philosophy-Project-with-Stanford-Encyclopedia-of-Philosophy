Only Camus, following the\nexample of Nietzsche, wrote a number of poems (in his youth writings\nand his notebooks, Camus 1933, 1935\u20131941). In many passages in Camus,\npoetry has a positive connotation. This connotation, however, refers to\na specific quality of language, viz., the use of vivid images that\nmanage to convey some truth about the human condition, rather than to\nthe merits of poetry as a specific literary form.\n\n\nFor Sartre, the stance of 19th century novelists who\nengaged in \u2018art for art\u2019s sake\u2019 is not too dissimilar\nto the problematic way modern poets approach language. In fact,\nSartre\u2019s studies on two of the major French poets of the\n19th century, Baudelaire and Mallarm\u00e9, are tinged\nwith the same disapprobation as his immense study of Flaubert (Sartre\n1947b, 1952b, 1971\u201372). Modern poetry for Sartre is, in the final\nanalysis, a misguided use of language. It uses language as an end in\nitself, a thing, the same way that a painter uses colour. This ignores\nthe fact that in language the relationship between materiality and\nsignification is the inverse to what is the case in other artistic\nmedia. Language is, for the existentialists, the favoured artistic\nmedium because, as the mode of expression that is most directly a\nmedium of signification, it is the one that best reveals a situation as\nsituation in the strong sense, viz., as a part of the world\nwhere human freedom is directly engaged metaphysically, ethically and\npolitically. Poets, on the other hand, \u201care men who refuse to\nutilise language. Now, since the quest for truth takes place in and by\nlanguage conceived as a kind of instrument, it is unnecessary to\nimagine that they aim to discern or expound the true. Nor do they dream\nof naming the world\u201d (Sartre 1948a, 5). In their use of language,\nmodern poets seem to overlook and act against the main qualities that\nthe existentialists grant it, namely, its representative and\ncommunicative powers. This explains why poetry remains at the margins\nof the existentialist system of the arts, as a literary genre that is\nnot as eminently philosophical and political as the theatre and the\nnovel. The existentialists are, once again, squarely at odds with the\nsurrealists, who condemned the novel and saw in poetry the real\nartistic medium.\n\n\nThe existentialists made, however, some notable exceptions. Camus,\nfor example, wrote a vibrant review of the work of Ren\u00e9 Char\n(Camus 1935\u20131936), and saw in the work of Francis Ponge an eminent\nillustration of the task of literature in the absurd situation of\npost-war France (Camus 1943). Sartre also dedicated a long and largely\npositive review to the work of Francis Ponge, seeing in it a kind of\nprofane phenomenology (Sartre 1944 in 1947a). This positive assessment\nmight well have rested on a misunderstanding, since Ponge seemed to\nhave had the exact opposite view of language as Sartre, and regarded\npoetry precisely as the form that would best be able to \u201cname the\nworld\u201d and make human freedom face its responsibility.\n",
