The \u201cPlatonic\u201d turn (after 1324): the \u2018regional\u2019 ontologies\n\nSince Burley conceives of primary substances as the ultimate\nsubstrates of existence and subjects of predication in relation to\nanything else (EP, ch. de substantia, fols. 24va\u2013b,\nand 25va), the only way to demonstrate the reality of beings in other\ncategories is to treat them as forms and attributes of substances.\nSince Burley wanted to preserve the reality of quantity and its real\ndistinction from substances and other accidents, he insists that\nquantity is a form inherent in the material part of a composite\nsubstance (EP, ch. de quantitate, fol. 29rb). This\nis problematic, however, for if the highest genus of the category is a\nform, Aristotle\u2019s seven species of quantity (line, surface, solid,\ntime, space, number, and speech), mentioned in the sixth chapter of\nthe Categories, are not. Burley tries to meet this difficulty\nby reformulating the notion of a quantified thing (quantum).\nEncouraged by the Aristotelian distinction between strict and\nderivative quantities (Categories 6, 5a38\u2013b10), he\ndistinguishes two different modes of being quantified: in-itself\n(per se) and in-virtue-of-something-else (per\naccidens). The seven species of quantity are quantified by\nthemselves, whereas other quantified things (e.g., corporeal\nsubstances) are quantified in virtue of one or more of the seven\nspecies (EP, ch. de quantitate, fol. 29va). In other\nwords, Burley considers the seven species not as quantitative forms,\nbut as the most proper and primary bearers (supposita) of the\nquantitative properties revealed by the supreme genus of the category.\nAny other kind of quantified thing is simply a subject\n(subiectum) of quantitative forms.\n\nAnother distinguishing mark of quantity is its characteristic\n(proprium). In the Categories (6, 6a26\u201335),\nAristotle identified it through the fact that only quantities are said\nto be equal or unequal. Burley does not wholly agree with him because\nquanta per accidens also are said to be equal or unequal,\nthough in a derivative way (EP, ch. de quantitate,\nfol. 32rb). Thus, Burley turns to two texts from Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics (books V, ch. 13 and X, ch. 1) for an alternative\naccount of the proprium of quantity as the measure of what is\nquantified (EP, ch. de quantitate, fol. 28rb).\nMoreover he employs this property as the common principle from which\nthe seven species of quantity can be derived (EP, ch. de\nquantitate, fol. 30ra). In this way, he tries to show that the\ncategory of quantity, like that of substance, has an ordered internal\nstructure, and he reasserts the reality and real distinction of\nquantity against authors such as Peter Olivi and Ockham, who had\nattempted to reduce quantity to an aspect of material substance.\nBurley quotes at length from Ockham\u2019s commentary on the\nCategories (ch. 10, \u00a7 4), where the Franciscan master\ntries to demonstrate that quantity is really nothing distinct from\nsubstance and quality. He then proceeds to reject Ockham\u2019s arguments\n(EP, ch. de quantitate, fol. 30rb\u2013vb).\n\nOckham had claimed that it was superfluous to posit quantitative forms\nreally distinct from substance and quality, since quantity presupposes\nwhat it is intended to explain, i.e., the extension of material\nsubstances and their having parts outside parts. As an accident,\nquantity presupposes substance as its substrate of inherence. Burley\ndenies that material substances can be extended without the presence\nof quantitative forms, thereby affirming their necessity. He admits\nthat the existence of any quantity always implies the existence of a\nsubstance, but he also believes that the actual existence of parts of\na substance necessarily implies the presence of a quantitative form in\nit. He does not provide any sound metaphysical reason for this\npreference. But it makes sense when one considers his semantic theory,\naccording to which reality is the interpretative pattern of\n(philosophical) language, so that the structure of language is a\nmirroring of reality. In Burley\u2019s opinion, therefore, abstract terms\nin the category of quantity (such as \u2018extension\u2019,\n\u2018duration\u2019, \u2018magnitude\u2019, and so on) must\ncorrespond to realities in the world that are distinct from those\nsignified by the abstract substantial terms.\n\nAs we have seen, Burley thinks that what falls under any categorial\nfield are simple accidental forms; therefore, the things of the ad\naliquid category are relations (relationes) and not\nrelatives (relativa or ad aliquid), which are merely\naggregates formed by a substance and a relation. Accordingly, the\nrelationship between relation and relatives is like that between\nquantity and what is quantified, or quality and what is qualified. The\nrelation is the cause of the nature of the aggregate (that is, the\nrelatives), of which it is a constituent. Unlike modern logicians,\nBurley denies that a relation is a two-place predicate, and views it\ninstead as a monadic function, arguing that like the other accidental\nforms, relation inheres in a single substrate and makes reference to\nanother thing without inhering in it. This thesis is based on the\nfollowing principle, which Burley states in his commentary on the\nBook of Six Principles (LsP, ch. de habitu,\nfol. 63ra): there must always be equivalence and correspondence\nbetween the accidental form and its substrate of inherence, so that no\naccidental form can completely inhere at the same time in two or more\ndifferent substrates\u2014not even numbers, the different parts of\nwhich inhere in their own distinct substrates. Unlike other accidental\nforms, however, relations do not directly inhere in their substrates,\nbut are present in them only by means of another accidental form that\nBurley calls the foundation of the relation (fundamentum\nrelationis\u2014EP, ch. de relatione, fol.\n34va). Among the nine categories of accidents, only quantity, quality,\naction, and affection can be the foundations of relations.\n\nConsequently, Burley claims that in the act of referring one substance\nto another we can distinguish five constitutive elements: (1) the\nrelation itself (e.g., the form of paternity); (2) the substrate of\nthe relation, i.e., the substance that denominatively receives the\nname of the relation (the animal which begets another similar to\nitself); (3) the foundation (fundamentum) of the relation,\ni.e., the absolute entity in virtue of which the relation inheres in\nthe substrate and makes reference to another substance (in this case,\nthe generative power); (4) the antecedent term (terminus a\nquo) of the relation, i.e., the substrate of inherence of the\nrelation considered as the subject of that relation (the father); and\n(5) the consequent term (terminus ad quem) of the relation,\ni.e., the substance with which the substrate of the relation is\nconnected, considered as the object with which the antecedent term is\ncorrelated (in our example, the son). The foundation is the main\ncomponent, since it joins the relation to the underlying substances,\npermits the relation to link the antecedent to the consequent term,\nand transmits some of its properties to the relation (EP, ch.\nde relatione, fol. 35rb\u2013vb). Even though the relation depends\nfor its existence on the foundation, its being is completely distinct\nfrom it, so that when the foundation fails the relation also fails,\nbut not vice versa (EP, ch. de relatione, fol.\n35ra).\n\nFrom this analysis Burley draws some rather important consequences\nabout the nature and ontological status of relations and relatives:\n(1) the existence relations have is feebler than that of any other\naccident, as it depends upon the simultaneous existence of three\ndifferent things: the substrate, the consequent term, and the\nfoundation; (2) relations do not add any absolute perfection to the\nsubstances in which they occur; (3) relations can inhere in substances\nwithout any change in the latter, through a change in the consequent\nterm of the relation (e.g., given two things, one white and the other\nblack, if the black thing becomes white then because of the change, a\nnew accident, a relation of similarity, will inhere in the other\nwithout any other change in it; (4) there are two main kinds of\nrelatives: real (secundum esse) and linguistic (secundum\ndici). Linguistic relatives (such as \u2018knowledge\u2019 and\n\u2018knowable\u2019) are connected only by the mutual reference of\nthe nouns signifying them. Real relatives are linked as well by a\nrelation which inheres in one of them and entails a real reference to\nthe other. Linguistic relatives in reality belong to the category of\nquality. Real relatives are aggregates compounded by a substance and a\nrelation, so that they fall under the category of relation only\nindirectly (per reductionem) because of their accidental\nform. Finally (5), all true relatives are simultaneous by nature\n(simul natura), so Aristotle was wrong in denying that some\npairs of relatives are mutually simultaneous, but one prior and the\nother posterior. In fact, the real cause of being a relative is the\nrelation, which at the same time inheres in one thing and entails a\nreference to the other, thereby making both things relatives\n(EP, ch. de relatione, fols. 32va\u2013b, 34ra,\n37ra).\n\nAmong the \u2018regional\u2019 ontologies Burley developed in his\nfinal commentary on the Ars Vetus, the one which deals with\nthe categorial field of quality is, in many ways, the least complex\nand problematic. Here Burley follows the Aristotelian doctrine very\nclosely, does not argue against Ockham, and sometimes offers rather\nsuperficial analyses.\n\nThe main topics he deals with are: (1) the internal structure of the\ncategory; (2) the relationship between quality and what is qualified\n(quale); (3) the nature of the four species of quality\nAristotle lists in the Categories (states and dispositions,\nnatural capacities or incapacities to do or suffer something,\naffective qualities and affections, shapes and external forms); and\n(4) the distinctive characteristic (proprium) of the category\nof quality, i.e., the fact that two or more things can be described as\nsimilar only because of quality and in respect of it. We will\nfocus on the first two only, since the questions they raise are more\ngeneral.\n\nFollowing the opinion of Duns Scotus (q. 36 of his Quaestiones in\nlibrum Praedicamentorum\u2014Questions on the Book of the\nCategories), Burley maintains that the four \u2018species\u2019\nof quality mentioned by Aristotle are not properly species but modes\n(modi) of quality. That is because unlike real species, they\nare not completely separate classifications, since many things\nbelonging to the first species also belong to the second and/or the\nthird (EP, ch. de qualitate, fol. 38vb).\n\nAs far as the nature of qualia and their relation to quality\nare concerned, Burley thinks that qualia are aggregates\ncomposed of a substance and a quality inhering in it. They do not\nbelong to any categorial field because they lack in real unity.\nNevertheless, since they are qualia in virtue of a\nqualitative form, they can be included in the category of quality\nindirectly (per reductionem\u2014EP, ch. de\nqualitate, fol. 41rb). Qualia share qualities to\ndifferent degrees. While no qualitative form admits of more or less,\ntheir substrates of inherence do (EP, ch. de\nqualitate, fol. 41vb). In this way, Burley advances two important\ntheses of his metaphysics as logical corollaries of his theories of\nuniversals and substances: (1) no universal form can be shared in\ndifferent degrees by the individual instantiating it; (2) no\nindividual form can be subject to change, except, of course, through\ngeneration and corruption.\n",
