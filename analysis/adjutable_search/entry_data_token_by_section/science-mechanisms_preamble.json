    "main_text": "\nAround the turn of the twenty-first century, what has come to be\ncalled the new mechanical philosophy (or, for brevity,\nthe new mechanism) emerged as a framework for thinking about\nthe philosophical assumptions underlying many areas of science,\nespecially in sciences such as biology, neuroscience, and\npsychology. In this entry, we introduce and summarize the distinctive\nfeatures of this framework, and we discuss how it addresses a range of\nclassic issues in the philosophy of science, including explanation,\nmetaphysics, the relations between scientific disciplines, and the\nprocess of scientific discovery. For each of these issues, we show how\nthe mechanistic framework has reoriented philosophical work, what the\nnew mechanism has contributed to the discussion, and what remains to\nbe done.\n",
