Is it Cheating to Use Enhancements?\nOne of the kinds of human enhancement that has received extensive\nphilosophical attention in recent years is the use of biomedical interventions to\nimprove the physical performance of athletes in the context of sports\n(Miah 2004; Murray 2009; Tolleneer 2013). One reason athletic\nperformance enhancement garners so much attention is because of its\ncurrency, given the epidemic of \u201cdoping\u201d scandals in\ncontemporary sport. Another reason, however, is that it seems to serve\nas a paradigm case for teasing out important dimensions of the problem:\nit involves measurable improvements in biological capacities in a\nsocial context that is both well outside health care and defined by\nclear rules of engagement.\nAt first impression, the ethical problem with performance\nenhancement in sport would seem to be simply a problem of cheating\n(Schermer, 2008a). If the rules of sport forbid the use of performance\nenhancements, then their illicit use confers an advantage to users\nagainst other athletes (who either accept the rules of the game or do\nnot have access to the enhancement interventions). That advantage, in\nturn, can create pressure for more athletes to cheat in the same way,\nundermining the basis for the competitions at stake and exacerbating\nthe gap between those who can afford enhancements and those who cannot\n(Murray 1987, Sparrow 2015). Extrapolating from sports to a\ncompetitive view of society at large, critics argue that the social\nacceptance of enhancement interventions in other spheres would also\ncreate unfair advantages for those with access to them, and perhaps\nlead to the development of new social divides between classes of\n\u201cgenobility\u201d and the \u201cgenpoor\u201d, raising\nfundamental justice and human rights concerns (Mehlman 2003, 2009;\nBuchanan, Brock, Wickler and Daniels 2000; Sparrow 2011).\n \nMuch of the rhetoric about \u201cdoping\u201d assumes the very\nclaim that needs to be established by argument: that the rules of\nsport (or the norms of social advancement) ought to ban the use of\nbiomedical enhancement. The rules of a game can be changed. In sports,\nnovel forms of performance enhancing equipment and training are\nroutinely introduced as athletic technology and expertise\nevolve. Where issues of athletes\u2019 equitable access arise, they\ncan be dealt with in one of two ways. Sometimes it is possible to\nensure fair distribution, as for example, when the International\nOlympic Committee negotiated an agreement with the manufacturer of the\nnew \u201cFastSkin\u201d swimming suit to provide suits to all the\nteams at the Sydney Olympics. In other cases, inequalities may simply\ncome to be accepted as unfortunate but not unfair. This is, for\nexample, how many people would view a story about an equatorial\ncountry that could not afford year-round artificial snow for its ski\nteam, and so could not compete evenly with the ski teams of northern\ncountries.  If enhancement interventions can either be distributed\nfairly or the inequities they create can be written into the rules of\nthe social game in question as part of the given advantages of the\nmore fortunate, then individual users no longer face a fairness\nproblem. For those who can afford it, for example, what would be\nethically suspect about mounting a mirror image of the \u201cSpecial\nOlympics\u201d for athletes with disabilities: a \u201cSuper\nOlympics\u201d, featuring athletes universally equipped with the\nlatest modifications and enhancements? (Munthe 2000) For answers to\nthat challenge, the critics of biomedical enhancement have to dig\nbeyond concerns about the fair governance of games to a deeper and\nbroader sense of \u201ccheating\u201d, in terms of the corrosive\neffects of enhancement on the integrity of admirable human practices\n(Loland 2002; Schermer 2008a).\nOn this view, to the extent that biomedical shortcuts allow specific\naccomplishments to be divorced from the admirable practices they were\ndesigned to reflect, the social value of those accomplishments will be\nundermined. If one\u2019s good grades are gained by drug fueled\n\u201ccramming\u201d rather than disciplined study, their value as\nevidence of learning diminish. This means that for institutions\ninterested in continuing to foster the social values for which they\nhave traditionally been the guardians, choices will have to be made.\nEither they must redesign their games to find new ways to evaluate\nexcellence in the admirable practices that are not affected by\navailable enhancements, or they must prohibit the use of the enhancing\nshortcuts. However, knowing which way to go suggests that one has a\ntheory of the social practice at risk and of the values that animate\nit. The case of sport again leads the way down this path in the\nliterature, perhaps because, unlike most important social practices\nthat might be susceptible to enhancement shortcuts (like child-rearing,\neducation, love, politics, and spiritual growth), the stakes are\nlow enough to allow for some deliberate policy-making at the\ninternational level.\nFor example, one prominent theory that has influenced the work of\nThe World Anti-Doping Association (WADA), the international\norganization committed to policing performance enhancement in elite\nsport, is the view that \u201cjust as healing is the point or goal or\nend of surgery, so the virtuous perfection of natural talents is the\npoint or goal or end of sport\u201d (Murray 2009). This statement has\nseveral important features for the enhancement debate. Sport is\nconcerned with celebrating differences in natural talents and the\nvirtues that can be displayed in attempts to differentiate one\u2019s\nown talents even further. The virtues that sport celebrates are\nsocially admirable habits and traits in and of themselves, and their\npromotion is what gives sport social value as a practice. However,\nwithin the practice, the virtues are instrumental (as either\nside-constraints or facilitators) to the perfection of the\nathlete\u2019s natural talents\u2014i.e., to their differentiation\nfrom other people\u2019s talents. Although the key role of\nhierarchical ranking in sport is often ignored in the rhetoric of\nsports organizations, philosophers of sport acknowledge that fixation\nwith hierarchical ranking\u2014with competition, contest,\nscore-keeping, record-breaking, championship, victory and\ndefeat\u2014is pervasive in the everyday practice of sport (Coakley\n1998) and that \u201ccomparing and ranking two or more\ncompetitors\u2026defines sports characteristic social\nstructure\u201d (Loland 2002, 10). Sport creates a system of values,\nvirtues, and practices that are designed to hierarchically grade people\nin terms of their (virtuously perfected) inherited traits and glorifies\nthe best specimens as champions. What is unfair about enhancement, on\nthis view, is that enhancement interventions undermine the ability of\nsport to distinguish those who passively inherited their talents from\ntheir progenitors from those who actively acquired them from their\nphysicians (Sandel 2004).\nBut this outcome seems to display the very problem that the\nfairness critique of enhancement was meant to combat: the danger of\nfomenting distributive injustice by creating social hierarchies of\nadvantage on arbitrary grounds (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2000;\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2005). On one hand, of the many ways humans use\ninherited traits to create interpersonal hierarchies, athletic\ncompetition is amongst the most benign. When it is \u201cjust a\ngame\u201d, comparative interpersonal ranking in terms of genetic\nidentity in sports is a welcome substitute for blood feuds, racism,\nand genocide. But when sport becomes a matter of national pride and a\nsource of economic opportunity, athletic losers risk more than simply\nadmiration and social status: like insurance applicants with genetic\nsusceptibilities, less naturally talented athletes risk access to\nimportant social benefits and potential life plans. In this regard,\nthe challenge that performance enhancement poses to sport is its\nindictment of the accepted social practice itself rather than its\nthreat to undermine it. The availability of biomedical abilities to\nundermine competition simply raises the question: are there ways to\nenjoy, appreciate and even show off our bodies and abilities without\nrequiring someone else to lose social standing on genetic grounds?\nFor the case of sports, it seems like this line of fairness\narguments ultimately backfires on the critics of enhancement. It opens\nthe door to thinking about enhancements as means to render the practice\nmore rather than less fair. Whether or not fairness arguments would\nhave a similar effect in debates about enhancement in the realm of\nother social practices, like parenting or diplomacy, is still an open\nquestion. But the theme of \u201ccheating\u201d has also been taken\nin another direction by the enhancement ethics literature, into\nconcerns about the authenticity of accomplishments achieved with the\nhelp of enhancements and the integrity of the enhanced individuals that\nclaim their rewards.\n",
