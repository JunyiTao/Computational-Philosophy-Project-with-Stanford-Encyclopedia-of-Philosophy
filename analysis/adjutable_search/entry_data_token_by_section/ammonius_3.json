    "main_text": "Philosophical Positions\n3. Philosophical Positions\n\nFor four reasons it is difficult to pinpoint Ammonius\u2019 own\nphilosophical positions and contributions to philosophy or to the\ninterpretation of Aristotle: (1) Our evidence is confined to\ncommentaries on Aristotle, whose interpretation did not leave as much\nscope for expounding Neoplatonic ideas as did that of Plato. (2) He\ndepends in these works on Proclus, whose Aristotle lectures or\ncommentaries do not survive, so that we cannot be sure what in them is\nreally his own. (3) Some of Ammonius\u2019 works failed to reach us.\n(4) We have to depend to a significant degree on his pupils\u2019\nwritings for our information about him and his contributions, and\ntheir own stance may be difficult to separate from that of Ammonius\nhimself. The best approach at present attempts to piece together\nAmmonius\u2019 views from his commentary on De\nInterpretatione, from statements attributed to him by later\ncommentators, and from those lectures of Ammonius which were either\npublished by students under Ammonius\u2019 name or which, while\npublished under students\u2019 names, seem to show little sign of\nhaving altered his teachings\u2014namely, Asclepius on the\nMetaphysics and the early commentaries of Philoponus (or\ntheir early versions, in the case of commentaries, such as that on the\nPhysics, which were revised). The use of Philoponus to\nrecover Ammonius\u2019 positions was much advanced by Verrycken\n1990a; his chronology of the commentaries by Philoponus\u2014and\nhence, the degree to which they may represent the thought of Ammonius,\nbefore Philoponus departed from it in important ways\u2014has\nrecently been revisited by Golitsis 2008 and Sorabji 2016d. (see\nabove, sect. 1.2).\n",
