    "main_text": "Creation and the big bang || Whose theism is the big bang supposed to confirm?\n2.1 Whose theism is the big bang supposed to confirm?\n\nThe big-bang theologian argues that the claim\n\n\u201cThe universe is 13 billion years old\u201d\n\n\nprovides evidential support for theism. But there are many theists for\nwhom the discovery that the universe is 13 billion years old would\nactually serve as a disconfirmation of their theistic belief. For\nexample, Bishop Ussher of Ireland (1581\u20131656) claimed to derive\nfrom the Bible that the universe was created in 4004 B.C.; and even in\nthe twenty-first century, some Christian thinkers claim Biblical\nwarrant for an age of the universe much less than 13 billion years\n(see Kelly 2000 and Byl 2001). For these thinkers, then, the big bang\nwould disconfirm theism\u2014or at least their version of theism,\nwhich is committed to the literal accuracy of the Biblical account of\ncreation. More strongly, it seems that Christian theism is committed\nto a belief in a finitely old universe primarily on the basis of its\ncommitment to the accuracy of Biblical accounts of creation. Thus, if\na theist comes to believe the big-bang account of the universe\u2019s\norigin, and hence to doubt the literal Biblical account, then she will\nlose one reason\u2014and possibly her only reason\u2014for believing\nthat the universe is finitely old.\n\nOf course, there are also theists who interpret Genesis metaphorically\nas implying that the universe was created, but not indicating a\nspecific age for the universe. For these theists, finding that the\nuniverse is finitely old might confirm rather than undermine their\nbelief.\n",
