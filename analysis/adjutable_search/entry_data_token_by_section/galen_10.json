    "main_text": "Causation || Explicit Categorizations of Causes\n5.1 Explicit Categorizations of Causes\nGalen\u2019s causal accounts bear very clear echoes of Aristotle, both linguistically and in the fundamental approach to causal explanations in the natural world. At the same time, where Galen gives a listing of the number of different causes that may be used in such explanations, he refers explicitly to Plato and seems indebted to the Platonic tradition. In a passage of UP\u2014the work which has the strongest Aristotelian echoes in this teleological sense\u2014he gives a list of five causes, which seems closely related to one attested elsewhere in Platonist writing: final, efficient, material, instrumental, formal (UP VI.12; see Hankinson 1994b and 1998). On the other hand, the list comes in a dialectical context, and Galen is certainly not in general concerned to give accounts which mention all five. Of those in this \u201cofficial\u201d list, it is the teleological and material that recur and are of most significance elsewhere. One might ask about the role of the two other \u201cAristotelian\u201d causes, the formal and the efficient. Explicitly, Galen has little role for the latter (although it is mentioned in an account of the demiurge\u2019s construction of the body; see further below). As for the formal: certainly, forms (eid\u0113) are of great importance in Galen\u2019s biology, where an account of both form and matter is necessary in the description of animals and their development. Forms, indeed, have a close conceptual relationship with the teleological cause, as the way in which design or structure enters the physical world; at the same time, their relationship with matter and in particular with the concept of mixture is difficult to extricate (see further \u00a76).\nGalen also makes use of a further set of causal categories, which are derived partly from the Stoic philosophical and partly from the medical tradition. Of particular importance\u2014especially in medical contexts\u2014are the concepts of \u201cantecedent\u201d (prokatarktikai) and \u201cpreceding\u201d (pro\u0113goumenai) causes; the further category of \u201ccontaining\u201d or \u201ccohesive\u201d (sunektikai) causes is also discussed. (Galen devoted two works explicitly to these causal concepts, CP and CC; see further Hankinson 1994b, 2008a.) While rejecting the specific Stoic theory to which this last category belongs, namely that objects require this type of cause as explanation of their persistence, Galen employs the concept to a limited extent, allowing that something productive of a particular effect, and co-temporal with that effect, may be considered its \u201ccontaining cause\u201d; he finds the category of some value for example in the analysis of the pulse.\nThe other two categories are of more significance. They help, for example, to explain how certain things may be called \u201ccauses\u201d even though they do not always bring about the effect in question. Antecedent causes are conditions which raise the likelihood of an outcome in a body (say, the occurrence of a disease); these are typically external conditions, for example extreme ambient heat or moisture. But the presence of such causes does not guarantee the outcome; this will depend on internal differences in the constitution of the bodies in question, and in particular a preceding cause will be required as trigger. Galen explores the problem through the example of a person who contracts fever as a consequence of exposure to heat in a public stadium. Not everyone present in the stadium at the same time was similarly affected; but this does not mean that exposure to heat was not correctly identified as a (part) cause. It is, namely, an antecedent cause, which will only produce the pathological outcome in conjuction with the relevant preceding (internal) cause. Again, Galen uses this framework in an epistemologically optimistic way, highlighting the ability of the expert to predict or correctly analyse such an outcome, given sufficient understanding of all the relevant causal features.\n\n",
