    "main_text": "Propositions in themselves\n3. Propositions in themselves\n\nBolzano\u2019s first important innovation in the TS aims at\nthe transformation of the domain of logic (more specifically, of the\nTheory of Elements). According to him, logic is not a theory of ideas\nand judgments in our mind, it is not an art de pens\u00e9e\nin the sense of Arnauld\u2019s and Nicole\u2019s Port-Royal\nLogic or an exposition of the laws of thought. Rather, logic is\nconcerned with the objective relations between propositions and ideas\nin themselves, that is, independently of their being thought\nor expressed.\n\nAlthough Bolzano took propositions to be composed of parts, which he\ncalled ideas, he does not offer a definition of the concept\nof a proposition as a certain kind of structured whole. The reason for\nthis was that no definition he had found in the writings of others,\nnor any that he could think of himself, was satisfactory. Instead, he\nseeks to convey what he means by \u2018proposition\u2019 using the\nprocedure he had earlier called \u2018circumscription\u2019 (cf.\nTS, \u00a7668, no. 9), presenting the reader with a number of\nsentences containing the word that are supposed to be true when it is\nrightly understood.\n\n\nOne will gather what I mean by proposition as soon as I\nremark that I do not call a proposition in itself or an\nobjective proposition that which the grammarians call a\nproposition, namely, the linguistic expression, but rather simply the\nmeaning of this expression, which must be exactly one of the two, true\nor false; and that accordingly I attribute actuality to the grasping\nof a proposition, to thought propositions as well as to the\njudgments made in the mind of a thinking being (existence,\nnamely, in the mind of the one who thinks this proposition and who\nmakes the judgment); but the mere proposition in itself (or the\nobjective proposition) I count among the kinds of things that\ndo not have any existence whatsoever, and never can attain existence.\nOur thinking of a proposition, our judgment that a\nthing is so and so, is something actual, which began at a certain time\nand will end at a certain time; the written signs, through\nwhich we record these propositions in some place or other are equally\nreally existing things; the propositions themselves, however, do not\nexist in any time or place (Bolzano 2004a: 40\u201341). \n\n\nThe expression \u2018in itself\u2019, as Bolzano explains elsewhere,\nis used to indicate that a term is used in its full generality, and\nhence that any customary tacit additions (such as thought or\nexpressed in a language) should be suppressed\n(TS,\u00a7 57, no. 2). In view of the unhelpful Kantian\nassociations with the expression \u2018in itself\u2019,\nBolzano\u2019s expression \u2018an sich\u2019 might also\nbe rendered as \u2018as such \u2019 (as suggested by Jan Berg) or\n\u2018per se\u2019.\n\nBolzano maintained that there are (es gibt)\npropositions in themselves, though they are not actual\n(wirklich), that is, do not act, or enter into causal\nrelations. Thus they have the status often accorded to mathematical\nobjects. And although he thought that the recognition of propositions\nin themselves was crucial for metaphysics, he also sought to persuade\nthose who did not share his metaphysical views to accept propositions\nbased on pragmatic and methodological considerations (TS,\n\u00a720, no. 1).\n\nIn this article, we will follow the common practice of the secondary\nliterature on Bolzano by using square brackets to form designations of\npropositions in themselves and like entities. Thus, for instance,\n\u2018[Socrates has wisdom]\u2019 designates the proposition in\nitself expressed by the sentence \u2018Socrates has wisdom\u2019,\nwhile \u2018[Socrates]\u2019 designates the part of that proposition\n(or idea) designated by \u2018Socrates\u2019.\n",
