Humans bore the\nimage of God, including the rationality Su\u00e1rez saw in all\nmortals. These beings could be moved by reason to right conduct,\nindividually and in politics. (Pink 2022: 279\u2013305). Spanish\nScholastics like Bartolom\u00e9 de Medina and Azpilcueta were deeply\nconcerned with casuistry, the means of guiding human conduct. Others,\nincluding some Protestants, used similar approaches. Casuistry can be\nfound in the discussion of such issues as lying through \u201cmental\nreservation\u201d. Cases of conscience were compiled to help in the\nguidance of souls, especially in avoidance of sin.\n\nThe uncertainties of life led to the development of the idea of\n\u201cprobabilism,\u201d looking to what was most likely when\ncertainty could not be obtained. Medina was a pioneer in this,\nclaiming that, when in doubt, one might discern the more probable\nopinion. This, in turn, permitted choosing the \u201cmore probable\noption\u201d\u2014or even a less probable choice\u2014in moral\ndecision making. It looks as if the first traces can already be found\nin writings of Vitoria and Alonso de la Vera Cruz (Eg\u00edo\nGarc\u00eda 2022). Probabilism was also used by some of the Jesuits\nwho were active in South America and Nueva Espa\u00f1a when they had\nto cope with problems of the treatment of Indigenous peoples and with\nAfrican slavery, e.g., Diego de Avenda\u00f1o (1594\u20131688)\n(Avenda\u00f1o 1668; Haar & Kaufmann 2023: Kap. 2.4.2.,\n4.2.).\n\nMore strictly, some theologians said to adopt only the safest course\nof action. Critics of such approaches, including Blaise Pascal,\ndenounced them for laxity, leading to use of \u201ccasuistry\u201d\nas a negative term (Sch\u00fcssler 2022). \n",
