    "main_text": "Neo-Kantianism || Materialism, Psychology without the Soul, and the Back to Kant Movement\n4.1 Materialism, Psychology without the Soul, and the Back to Kant Movement\n\nThe domination of German philosophy by Hegelian Idealism for the first\nthird of the nineteenth century was followed by a revival of\nmaterialism. This was in part brought on by the criticisms of\nChristian theology and supernaturalism in David Friedrich\nStrauss\u2019s The Life of Jesus and the criticisms of\nChristian theology and Hegelian idealism in the works of Ludwig\nFeuerbach, most famously in The Essence of Christianity. The\nrevival was also given impetus by the recent successes and the\nincreasing prestige of the natural sciences. This new materialism was\nrepresented by figures including Karl Vogt, Jacob Moleschott, Eugen\nD\u00fchring, Ludwig B\u00fcchner, and Heinrich Czolbe. These\nmaterialists explicitly took the natural sciences as their ideal.\nIndeed, many of them were practicing natural scientists. (See Edgar\n(2015), sections 6.2, 6.5, and passim, for analysis of\nB\u00fcchner\u2019s and Lange\u2019s accounts of objectivity. See\nMayerhofer and Vanacek 2007 and Pecere 2000, ch. 4, for Lange\u2019s\npsychology and its relationship to his philosophy.)\n\nLange thought that materialism faced serious problems; however, he\nalso thought that Hegelian idealism was bankrupt. What was needed was\na philosophical approach that would be compatible with the recent\nsuccesses of materialistic explanations as deployed by the natural\nsciences but not simply be a form of materialism. Lange was one of the\nfirst in this period to argue that the appropriate response to the\nphilosophical situation in Germany at the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury was to return to Kant. (See Widmer, forthcoming, for a new\nevaluation of Lange\u2019s positions on Kant. Beiser (2014) contains a\ncareful appreciation of Lange as a central figure in the \u201cComing\nof Age\u201d of Neo-Kantianism; see Patton (2015) and Edgar (2015)\nfor reviews of Beiser.) As Lange put it in a letter, \u201cI take the\nHegelian System to be a step backward towards Scholasticism from which\nwe are really already free. Herbart, to whom I first attached myself,\nwas for me only a bridge to Kant, to whom so many honest researchers\nreturn in order to, where possible, complete what Kant had only half\ndone: the annihilation of metaphysics\u201d (Ellissen 1894, 106).\nLange was thus one of the founding figures in what was to emerge as\nthe neo-Kantian movement rallied by Otto Liebmann\u2019s slogan\n\u201cBack to Kant!\u201d\n\nWhile keeping much of the language of Kant, Hermann von Helmholtz,\namong others, worked to change the questions being asked in\nKant\u2019s name and the methods used to find answers to these\nquestions. It is not easy to assess the degree of continuity between\nthe strands of neo-Kantianism that emerged and Kant\u2019s own\ninterests. Lange is sometimes taken as the founder of the Marburg\nSchool of neo-Kantianism. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say\nthat Lange was a mentor of the first famous member of the Marburg\nSchool, Hermann Cohen. The other well-known members were Paul Natorp\nand Ernst Cassirer. The appendices of the second volume of Holzhey\n(1986) contains Cohen\u2019s correspondence, including some\ncorrespondence between Cohen and Lange. In general, Holzhey (1986) is\nan excellent source of information on the foundation of the Marburg\nSchool, as is Sieg 1994. Holzhey and Bu\u00e9e (2011) and Holzhey\n(2005) explore the relationship between Cohen and Lange. Karl\nVorl\u00e4nder published a review of Cohen\u2019s lengthy\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to Lange\u2019s History of\nMaterialism in 1897, in Kant-Studien.\nVorl\u00e4nder\u2019s brief review nonetheless sets out a number of\ndifferences of method and conclusion between Cohen and Lange. In many\nways Hermann Cohen returned to a conception of the basic questions of\nepistemology that was closer to Kant\u2019s, one Vorl\u00e4nder calls\n\u201ccritical idealism\u201d. Lange, on the other hand, drew on\nHelmholtz\u2019s early thought to conclude that the scientific\ninvestigation of the physiology of the sense organs provided partial\nconfirmation of Kant\u2019s fundamental claims.\n\nIn the 1850s, Helmholtz had argued that contemporary science was\nconfirming on empirical grounds insights that Kant had had but that\nKant took as supported by a priori considerations. In his famous\naddress, \u201cOn Goethe\u2019s Scientific Researches\u201d, he\nclaimed:\n\nThe result of [scientific] examination, as at present understood, is\nthat the organs of sense do indeed give us information about external\neffects produced on them, but convey those effects to our\nconsciousness in a totally different form, so that the character of a\nsensuous perception depends not so much on the properties of the\nobject perceived as on those of the organ by which we receive the\ninformation. (Helmholtz 1853, 13)\n\n\nThe ground for this conclusion was supposed to be the fact, uncovered\nby physiology, that nerves are not faithful transmitters of external\nproperties to consciousness (Helmholtz 1853, 13). Helmholtz inferred\nfrom this his famous sign theory, according to which \u201cour sensations\nare for us only symbols of the objects of the external world, and\ncorrespond to them only in some such way as written characters or\narticulate words to the things they denote. They give us, it is true,\ninformation respecting the properties of things without us, but no\nbetter information than we give a blind man about colour by verbal\ndescriptions\u201d (Helmholtz 1853, 14). Thus, Helmholtz argues,\n\u201cwhat the recent physiology of the senses has shown by the way\nof experience is what Kant had tried to show for the representations\nof the human mind in general when he laid out the participation of the\nparticular, built-in rules of the mind, the organization of the mind\nas it were, in our representations\u201d (Helmholtz 1855, 58).\nHelmholtz thinks the confirmation of Kant goes further. The only way\nto get from the \u201cworld of sensations\u201d to the \u201cworld\nof reality\u201d, the \u201cexternal world\u201d, is through an\ninference. We infer that there is an external world because there has\nto be a \u201ccause of our nerve excitations because there\ncan be no effect without cause.\u201d But, Helmholtz asks, \u201cHow\ndo we know that there is no effect without a cause?\u201d This is not\na principle we could learn from experience, since it must be in place\nbefore we can come to any conclusions about the world, including the\nconclusion that cause follows effect. Thus, \u201cthe investigation\nof sensory perception also leads us to what Kant had already\nrecognized, namely that the principle, \u2018No effect without\ncause\u2019, is a law of our thought given before all\nexperience\u201d (Helmholtz 1855, 77). Thus, as he puts it later,\nwhat science shows us does not decide the question between idealism\nand realism:\n\nIt is always good to keep this in mind so as not to conclude more from\nthe facts than is warranted. The different shadings of idealistic and\nrealistic opinions are metaphysical hypothesis which, so long as they\nare recognized as such, and however injurious they may become when\nrepresented as dogma or as supposed necessities of thought, are\ncompletely justified scientifically. (Helmholtz 1878, 360).\n\n\nOne should wholeheartedly welcome the successes of natural science and\nempirical methodology, but the naive realism of the materialists was\nmistaken. The epistemological questions need to be taken\nseriously.\n\nLange\u2019s most famous book, The History of Materialism and\nCritique of its Contemporary Significance, is in essence a\ndefense of such a return to Kant. It is also a detailed history of\nmaterialism (and was read well into the twentieth century for\nprecisely this reason). More fundamentally, The History of\nMaterialism was meant to drive home the above-mentioned concerns.\nLange accepted materialism as a sensible maxim for the construction of\ntheories within natural science. However, as a comprehensive\nphilosophical system, as both fundamental ontology and epistemology,\nmaterialism is self-undermining.\n\nLange\u2019s History is divided into two parts. The first\npart covers the history of materialism from the atomism of Democritus\ntill the time of Kant. It includes discussions of what Lange considers\nto be reactions to materialism: the philosophical positions of Plato\nand Aristotle and the theological positions taken by both Christian\nand Muslim scholars. He includes a discussion of the dominance of\nAristotelianism in the writings of the Scholastics. Materialism\nfinally returns with the regeneration of science. In this context,\nafter discussions of Gassendi and Hobbes, he turns to Newton and\nLocke. Finally he treats Leibniz as a German reaction to materialism.\nThe second part covers the history of materialism from the time of\nKant. The opening section of this part is a discussion of Kant\u2019s\nown position in relation to materialism and sets the stage for\nLange\u2019s \u201cback to Kant\u201d arguments. These arguments\nare directed against the contemporary forms of materialism mentioned\nabove.\n\nLange claims that \u201cthe empirical method has celebrated its\nhighest triumph\u201d in the physiology of the sense organs. But this\ntriumph \u201cat the same time \u2026 leads us to the very limits\nof our knowledge, and betrays to us at least so much of the sphere\nbeyond it as to convince us of its existence\u201d (Lange\n1873\u201375, 3:202; see also 2:158). Such physiological\ninvestigation into the sense organs may initially look favourable for\nthe materialists, in that it promises to give us a materialistic\naccount of our knowledge of the world. In fact, it is deadly to\nmaterialism as an ontology. Physiology shows us that the sense organs\ndo not show us how the world really is and indeed that our very\nconcept of matter may have nothing to do with what is really there in\nthe world (Lange 1873\u201375, 3:\n 205\u201319).[7]\n\nThe arguments Lange deploys are drawn from research into the\nphysiology of perception, by materialist researchers and by Helmholtz\nhimself. For example, Lange claims that the physiology of our eyes\nshows that the visual sensation of a single three-dimensional object\nin front of me is in fact a composite generated from the two\ntwo-dimensional stimulations of each of my retinas (Lange 1873\u201375,\n3:203). Supposedly we learn that even the simplest of sensations is\nnot the result of a single natural process, but the combination of\nmany different processes (3:203\u2013204). Furthermore, we learn that\n\u201ccolours, sounds, smells, &c., do not belong to things in\nthemselves, \u2026 they are peculiar forms of excitation of our\nsensibility, which are called forth by corresponding but qualitatively\nvery different phenomena in the world\u201d (3:217). Indeed,\naccording to these physiological accounts, only a very specific set of\nvibrations is picked out and the rest are ignored (3:217). We learn\nthat there is a blind spot on the retina but that the brain fills in\nthe spot when constructing our image of the world (3:220). The\nconclusion Lange wants us to draw from all of this is that the world\nwe think we see is radically different from the way the world really\nis by materialism\u2019s own lights.\n\nLange considers the possibility that many of these then commonplace\narguments could perhaps be seen merely as arguments in favour of a\nsubjective account of secondary qualities, and that one could respond\nby insisting that nonetheless the empirical theory we construct gives\nus a correct account of the primary qualities. Indeed, for all that\nhas been said, someone might argue, we may still be warranted in\nthinking that reality is composed of bodies in motion in space.\nHowever, Lange wants to resist even this move, the \u201clast refuge\nof Materialism\u201d as he calls it (3:224):\n\nJust as the vibrations of the phenomenal world we have to deal with\nare related to the colours of the immediately seen, so too an\nentirely, to us, inconceivable order of things might be related to the\norder of time and space that rules in our perceptions.\n(3:224\u2013225)\n\n\nFor example, Lange claims that physical space could easily be of more\nthan three dimensions without that having any effect on our phenomenal\nworld (3:227). Thus materialism, as the belief in \u201cmaterial,\nself-existent things\u201d is thoroughly undermined: the\n\u201cconsistent Materialistic view thus changes around, therefore,\ninto a consistently idealistic view\u201d (Lange 1873\u201375,\n3:215, 223).\n\nIn trying to understand Lange\u2019s position, it is helpful to see\nthe kind of view he thinks would escape these worries. Lange considers\none version of materialism in his book that he thinks does not\nundermine itself. This is the position of Heinrich Czolbe, the author\nof Neue Darstellung des Sensualismus. Lange credits him for\nbeing the only one among the materialists to truly face up to the\nproblems regarding perception generated by materialism for itself\n(Lange 1873\u201375, 2: 105).\n\nCzolbe gets credit from Lange for facing up to the self-undermining\nnature of materialism, precisely because Czolbe takes as central the\nproblem created by the above mentioned empirical arguments about the\nnature of nerve processes in sense organs. He takes this to be the\nproblem that Feuerbach, Vogt, Moleschott, and others have not dealt\nwith adequately (Czolbe 1855, vi; Lange 1873\u201375, 3:286). Indeed,\nCzolbe complains that the physiologists play right into the hands of\nthe speculative, idealistic philosophers, because they do not think\nthrough the philosophical consequences of their physiological theories\n(Czolbe 1856, 27\u201328). The only way to defeat the speculative\nphilosophers, Czolbe argues, is to insist that sensory qualities are\nmechanically propagated through the nerves without any change (Czolbe\n1855, 14; 1856, 15\u201316, 27\u201328). His view appears to be that\nqualitative properties such as colours or sounds are transmitted\ndirectly from the outside to the inside. The suggestion is that\ncolours and sounds exist independently of the subject. They are not\ngenerated by the nerves, rather, they are transmitted to the inside of\nthe brain by the nerves. Of course, Czolbe was not ignorant of wave\ntheories of light or sound, but claimed that the wave particle already\nis the colour or sound, which has only to be transmitted to the right\nspot in the brain in order for us to be conscious of it. As Lange\nmockingly emphasizes, the sound waves somehow involve the experience\nof their sound in themselves already (Lange 1873\u201375, 2:111).\nCzolbe appears to bite this bullet, and accepts Hermann Lotze\u2019s\ndescription of his view, according to which\n\nthe sensible qualities of sensation are already completely present in\nthe external stimuli, that from a red-radiating object a ready-made\nredness, from a sound source a melody, detaches itself in order to\npenetrate into us through the portals of the sense organs (Czolbe\n1856, 14).\n\n\nIf this were the correct view of how the sense organs work, then,\nCzolbe claims, we would have an empirical account of knowledge that\nwas not self-undermining.\n\nOne immediate problem was how to defend such a view against the\nempirical evidence then available. Consider, for example, something\nCzolbe was aware of: the presence of electrical currents in nerves.\nThe worry for Czolbe is that light waves end up being converted to\nelectrical currents in the nerves, which might lead back to the\nsupposedly self-undermining empirical stories of the other\nmaterialists. Czolbe\u2019s response is first to point out that it is\npossible that both electricity and light\u2014not just light waves\nbut the sensations of light\u2014could be transmitted at the same\ntime. He then points to supposed empirical data that at the moment of\nexcitation the electrical current in the nerve weakens. This, he\nthinks, is decisive evidence that the electrical current is not\nresponsible for transmission since if it were, the electrical current\nwould have to increase at the moment of excitation rather\nthan decrease (Czolbe 1855: 16\u201317).\n\nLange concedes that Czolbe\u2019s materialism, were it to actually be\nsupported by empirical evidence, is in principle able to avoid\nundermining itself. To Lange, though, Czolbe has to twist the\nempirical evidence, and so Czolbe\u2019s materialism ultimately does\nundermine itself. Lange accuses Czolbe of being obstinate and treating\nthe results of scientific investigations in an unscientific manner, as\nmere illusions that would disappear on closer examination (Lange\n1873\u201375, 2:291).\n\nLange thus thinks he has good grounds for drawing the following\nconclusions from his discussion of physiology and materialism:\n\nThe sense-world is a product of our organisation.\nOur visible (bodily) organs are, like all other parts of the\nphenomenal world, only pictures of an unknown object.\nThe transcendent basis of our organisation remains therefore just\nas unknown to us as the things which act upon it. We have always\nbefore us only the product of both. (Lange 1873\u201375, 3: 219)\n\n\nHe sees himself as agreeing with Helmholtz when Helmholtz\n\u201cresolves the activity of the senses into a kind of\ninference\u201d (Lange 1873\u201375, 3:228). It does not follow, he\nemphasizes, that \u201cthe search for a physical mechanism of\nsensation, as of thought, [is] superfluous or inadmissible. At length,\nhowever, we see that such a mechanism, like every other represented\nmechanism, must be itself only a necessarily occurring picture of an\nunknown state of things\u201d (Lange 1873\u201375, 3:229). He\nconcludes:\n\nThe senses give us, as Helmholtz says, effects of things, not\nfaithful copies, let alone the things themselves. To these mere\neffects, however, belong also the senses themselves, together with the\nbrain and the supposed molecular movements in it. We must therefore\nrecognise the existence of a transcendent world order, whether this\ndepends on \u201cthings-in-themselves\u201d, or whether\u2014since\neven the \u201cthing in itself\u201d is but a last application of\nour intuitive thought\u2014it depends on mere relations, which\nexhibit themselves in various minds as various kinds and stages of the\nsensible, without its being at all conceivable what an adequate\nappearance of the absolute in a cognizing mind would be. (Lange\n1873\u201375, 3:230)\n\n\nThat we do not have knowledge of this transcendent order shows us that\nall metaphysics is, like art, a creation of the imagination.\nNonetheless we should still \u201cin natural science everywhere apply\nthe same conceptions and methods as the Materialist; but what to the\nlatter is definitive truth is to the Idealist only the necessary\nresult of our organisation\u201d (Lange 1873\u201375, 3:324).\n\nAs the nineteenth century came to a close, critics of the Back to Kant\nmovement, including Ernst Mach, began to question Helmholtz\u2019s\nand Lange\u2019s appeal to the thing in itself. Edgar (2012)\nidentifies a \u201cdeep tension\u201d: Helmholtz and Lange\n\u201cwanted to conceive of things in themselves as the causes of our\nsensations, while their own accounts of causal inference ruled that\nclaim out\u201d (p. 1). Edgar (2012) goes on to argue that\n\u201cThese Neo-Kantians\u2019 problems with things in themselves\nwere fully solved only by Ernst Mach, in the context of the\nuncompromisingly austere theory of knowledge he developed in the early\n1880s, in his 1882 \u2018The Economical Nature of Physical\nInquiry\u2019 and his 1884 \u2018Contributions to the Analysis of\nSensations\u2019\u201d (p. 2). While Mach is critical of Helmholtz\nand of Lange, Edgar emphasizes nonetheless that:\n\nIn a context where German-speaking philosophers were responding in a\nvariety of ways to a rapid accumulation of results in experimental\npsychology and the physiology of the sense organs, Mach\u2019s views\nof knowledge from the 1880s are in certain central respects continuous\nwith the psychologistic epistemology that Back to Kant Neo-Kantians\nsought to articulate over the course of the 1860s and 1870s. Like\nLange and others, Mach took M\u00fcller\u2019s and Helmholtz\u2019s\nphysiological investigations of sensory processes as a model for how\nto marshal the methods of natural science in the project of explaining\nthe cognitive processes that give rise to knowledge (p. 19).\n\n\nIn summer 2015, a special issue of Philosophical Readings,\nedited by Pietro Gori, focused on \u201cAnti-metaphysical\nPsychology\u201d. Gori (2015b) and Martinelli (2015), especially,\nfocus on Lange\u2019s place within the tradition of \u201cpsychology\nwithout a soul\u201d, as Lange and Brentano dubbed it. The work of\nMichael Heidelberger (2015, among other works) investigates\nLange\u2019s place in the physiological tradition.\n\nLange\u2019s History of Materialism is known to have had an\ninfluence on Friedrich Nietzsche, who learned about Gustav Fechner and\nothers in the \u201cpsychophysics\u201d movement from Lange\u2019s\nwork. Nietzsche went on to re-define philosophy as\n\u201cpsycho-physiology\u201d in Beyond Good and Evil\n(Nietzsche 2002/1886, 23, see also Gori 2015a). George L.\nStack\u2019s Lange and Nietzsche brought the question of\nLange\u2019s influence on Nietzsche to the forefront. For critical\nresponses see Breazeale (1989), Seigfried (1989), Wilcox (1989), and\nPletsch (1991); also see Salaquarda (1978, 1979, and 1996), Leiter\n(2013), Campioni (2019); Swift (2005). Stack responds to critics in\nStack (1989 and 1991). R. Kevin Hill assesses the influence of Lange,\nSchopenhauer, and Kant on Nietzsche\u2019s thought (2003); for a\ncritical perspective see Clark and Dudrick (2005). Villarroel\nSoto et al. (2020) and Slama (2019) assess the extent to which\nNietzsche can be considered a Kantian, and how Lange may have\ninfluenced Nietzsche in this direction.\n\nThe section following details Lange\u2019s criticisms of metaphysics\nand religion on the basis of materialism and scientific achievement,\nand his argument that the ethical standpoint, like metaphysics, is a\ncreation of the imagination like Schiller\u2019s poetry. These ideas\nare perhaps one reason why Nietzsche himself cited Lange as an\ninfluence on his thought.\n",
