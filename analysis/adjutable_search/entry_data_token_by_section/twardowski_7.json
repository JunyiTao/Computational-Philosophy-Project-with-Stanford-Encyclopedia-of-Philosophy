The Lvov Years: 1895\u20131938\n\nAmong the issues that Twardowski only sketched or left open in his\nVienna years and investigated later are, next to theories of truth and\nknowledge (Theory of Knowledge, 1925; see Schaar 2015, Chapter\n5.3), the relationship between time and truth (\u2018On the So-called\nRelative Truths,\u2019 1900) and that between linguistic meaning and\nthe content of mental acts (\u2018Actions and Products,\u2019 1912).\nParticularly important themes to mention are the relationship between\na priori or deductive sciences, a posteriori or\ninductive sciences and the notion of grounding (\u2018A Priori and A\nPosteriori Sciences,\u2019 1923), and the relation between\nphilosophy, psychology and physiology (\u2018Psychology vs.\nPhysiology and Philosophy\u2019, 1897b). Well worth mentioning are\nTwardowski's writings on issues of philosophical methodology\n(\u2018On Clear and Obscure Philosophical Style,\u2019 1919/20;\n\u2018Symbolomania and Pragmatophobia,\u2019 1921). He also left a\nrelatively substantial corpus of writings in ethics (\u2018On Ethical\nSkepticism\u2019, 1905-24).\n\nTwardowski's publications during his Lvov years are in Polish, but of\nthose writings that Twardowski considered as important academic\npublications we normally also have German versions. Especially\nimportant and influential among these are \u2018On the So-Called\nRelative Truths\u2019 (1900) and \u2018Actions and Products\u2019\n(1912). \n3.1 On the so-called relative truths (1900)\n\n\u2018On the So-Called Relative Truths\u2019 (henceforth:\nRelative Truths) is a work of fundamental importance for the\ndevelopment of the idea of absolute truth in Poland. Scholars have\ndeemed its impact to have reached as far as Tarski's work on truth\n(Wolenski & Simons 1989). It certainly influenced the\n1910\u20131913 discussion on future contingents which involved\nKotarbi\u0144ski, Le\u015bniewski, and \u0141ukasiewicz, which served\nlater as metaphysical foundation for \u0141ukasiewicz's three-valued\nlogic (Wole\u0144ski 1990). Twardowski's position is distinctive and\ninteresting because it is a non-platonistic theory of absolute truth,\nthough it is difficult to say exactly what place it occupies with\nrespect to Le\u015bniewski's nominalistic or to Tarski's platonistic\napproach (for these labels see Simons 2003: section 2.) One of the\nreasons why it was important for Twardowski to defend an\nanti-relativistic notion of truth was that relativism jeopardizes the\npossibility of constructing ethics as a science based on principles\n(on Twardowski's ethics, see Paczkowska-\u0141agowska 1977). \nThis aspect is important because Twardowski is usually characterized\nnot as a builder of systems, but as championing \u2018small\nphilosophy.\u2019 This is correct, in some sense, but it should not\nmake one mistakenly think that there is no unity sought in\nTwardowski's thought, or that his works are separate small occasional\ncontributions without overarching ideas in the background governing\ntheir development.\n\nIn Relative Truths, Twardowski opposes Brentano's ideas on the\nrelationship between time and truth, and sides instead with Bolzano's\n views.[9]\n By \u2018truth,\u2019 Twardowski means a true judgment and by\n\u2018absolute truth\u2019 he means a judgment true independently of\nany circumstance, time, and place.\n\nThe main claim of Relative Truths is that every truth (falsity)\nis absolute, i.e. no judgment changes its truth-value relatively to\ncircumstance, time, or place. Although Twardowski's treatment is\ngeneral, and is not confined to the relation between truth and time,\nit is his ideas on the latter that were particularly important for\nlater discussions. We can characterize Twardowski's view in this\nrespect as the view that a judgment is true for ever and\nsince ever, that is: \n\nOmnitemporal truth:\n\nFor any judgment g, if g is true at a time\nt, then it is true also at an arbitrary time\nt\u2032 past or future with respect to t (the same\napplies, mutatis mutandis, to falsity).\n\n\nTwardowski's aim is to defend this claim against those who argue that\ntruth is relative on the basis of examples of elliptical sentences\n(such as \u2018I don't\u2019), sentences with indexicals (\u2018my\nfather is called Vincent\u2019), sentences of general form\n(\u2018radioactivity is good for you\u2019), and sentences about\nethical principles (\u2018it is wrong to speak against one's own\nconvictions\u2019). Those who argue that truth is relative on this\nbasis, says Twardowski, make a mistake. They confuse judgments, which\nare the real truth-bearers, with the (type) sentences expressing them.\nBut sentences are merely the external expression of judgments, and\noften they do not express everything one has in mind when judging. For\nhuman speech has a purely practical task; it can perfectly serve its\ncommunicative purposes and yet be strictly speaking ambiguous or\nelliptic.\n\nTwardowski's main point is that we can disambiguate ambiguous\nsentences or integrate elliptic ones in such a way that they become\nthe appropriate means of expression of the judgment that they actually\nand strictly speaking express (Twardowski 1900, 156)\u2014we can make\nsentences eternal, as we would say in our Post-Quinean age. Once we\nshow that eternalization is possible, the confusion on which\nrelativists rely is dispelled. For instance, if standing in Lvov on\nthe High Castle Hill, I assert that it is raining, \n\nI do not have in mind just any rain, falling at any place and time,\nbut I voice a judgment about the rain falling here and now\n(Twardowski 1900, 151).\n\n\nOne could object that the true sentence \u2018it is raining here and\nnow\u2019 is relative because it may become false, i.e. be true when\nuttered in Amsterdam and become false when uttered in the Dry Valley\nin Antarctica. Twardowski observes that this impression is, again,\nonly due to the ambiguity of the indexicals \u2018here and now\u2019\nin the sentence. Take thus the sentence\n\n(i) It is raining here and now,\n\n\nwhen uttered in Lvov, on 1 March 1900, in accordance with the\nGregorian calendar, at noon, Central European Time, on the High Castle\nHill. That sentence expresses the same judgment as\n\n(i*) On 1 March 1900, in accordance with the Gregorian calendar, at\nnoon, Central European Time, it is raining in Lvov, on the High Castle\nHill and in its vicinity.\n\n\nAccording to Twardowski, the difference between the two sentences is\nonly in their brevity and their practical use. Take now the\nsentence\n\n(ii) It is raining here and now,\n\n\nwhen uttered in Krakow on 2 March 1900, in accordance with the\nGregorian calendar, at noon, Central European Time, on the Castle\nHill. That sentence expresses the same judgment as\n\n(ii*) On 2 March 1900, in accordance with the Gregorian calendar, at\nnoon, Central European Time, it is raining in Krakow, on the Castle\nHill and in its vicinity.\n\n\nIt's not that we have in (i) and (ii) one and the same judgment; we\nhave the same sentence, which expresses two different\njudgments, (i*) and (ii*). Therefore, one cannot argue that the\nsame judgment can turn from true to false.\n\n\nIt is apparent that [the judgment expressed by (i) and (i*)], which\n[...] asserts that it is raining, is true not only at a particular\ntime and place, but is always true. (Twardowski 1900, 153)\n\n[...] Only sentences can be said to be relatively true; yet the truth\nof a sentence depends on the truth of the judgment expressed by that\nsentence; usually a given sentence can express various judgments, some\ntrue, some false, and it is thus relatively true because it expresses\na true judgment only under certain conditions, i.e. if we consider it\nas an expression of a judgment which is true (Twardowski 1900, 169).\n\n\n\nNotice that Twardowski is not saying that judgments can be integrated\nor completed: the judgments we formulate in our head, and which\nare true or false, are complete and fully unambiguous. It is\nfor this reason that he can think that the procedure of completing\nsentences as expressions of judgments can be carried out. \n\nAn important thing to notice in Relative Truths is that\nTwardowski, differently from what Meinong and \u0141ukasiewicz were to\ndo, did not question the principle of contradiction or the principle\nof the excluded middle. \n\nTwardowski's idea that one can have absolute truth in an all-changing\nworld has been recently taken up by Simons (2003). \n3.2 Actions and Products (1912)\n\nFor quite some time Twardowski thought that logic was dependent on\npsychology\n [10],\n and continued to hold the psychologistic idea of meaning as mental\ncontent from Content and Object. In his\n\u2018Self-Portrait,\u2019 Twardowski says that he changed his mind\nin an anti-psychologistic sense because of Husserl's Logical\nInvestigations\n (1900/01).[11]\n \u2018Actions and Products\u2019 (1912) is the first printed work\nwhere Twardowski favors an \u2018Aristotelian\u2019 view of ideal\nmeaning, i.e. of meaning in specie, which he associates with\nthat of Husserl's in the Logical Investigations. \n\nIn marking the line of demarcation between logic and psychology on the\nbasis of the distinction act/product which underlies his theory of\nmeaning, Twardowski writes:\n\nIndeed, a rigorous demarcation of products from actions has already\ncontributed enormously to liberating logic from psychological\naccretions. (Twardowski 1912, \u00a745, 132)\n\n\nTwardowski's mature theory of meaning is connected with the rigorous\ndefinition of the distinction between actions and\nproducts of actions (while in Relative Truths he speaks\nof judgments as actions or products). On the basis of grammatical\nanalyses, purporting however to show logically salient differences,\nTwardowski establishes a basic distinction between physical,\npsychical (i.e. mental), and psychophysical actions and\ntheir products. The analysis is reminiscent in philosophical style of\nthat of \u2018the presented\u2019 in Content and Object,\nthough more general, and a nice example of the method which has become\nnow strongly associated with analytic philosophy.\n\nThe relationship between an action and what results from it, its\nproduct, is exemplified linguistically in the relationship between a\nverb and the corresponding noun as internal complement (Twardowski\n1912, \u00a71, 10; \u00a78, 107): \n\n\n\n\n\nAct\nProduct \n\nPhysical\nrunning\nrun \n\nMental\njudging\njudgment \n\nPsychophysical\nspeaking\nspeech  \n\n\n\nA psychophysical product (e.g., a speech) differs from a mental\nproduct (e.g., a judgment) because it is perceptible to senses; it\ndiffers from a physical product (e.g., a run) because in the\npsychophysical action which produces it (speaking) a mental action is\nalso involved, which has bearing on the physical action, and thus on\nits product (\u00a710). In some cases, a psychophysical product\nexpresses a mental product; for instance, a sentence is a\npsychophysical product which expresses a mental product, a\njudgment.\n\nTwardowski points out that the meaning of the noun\n\u2018judgment,\u2019 like other nouns (\u2018mistake\u2019), is\nambiguous between action and product. A judgment in the sense of the\naction (a judging) is a judgment in the psychological sense,\nwhile a judgment in the sense of the product is a judgment in the\nlogical sense (\u00a714) (a third meaning of\n\u2018judgment\u2019 is that of \u2018disposition, aptitude to make\ncorrect judgments,\u2019 \u00a715).\n\nTwardowski points out that he uses \u2018judgment\u2019 in the sense\nof \u2018judgment in the logical sense,\u2019 i.e. the product of\nthe action of judging, and he clarifies that what he means now by\n\u2018judgment-product\u2019 is the content of judgment in\nContent and Object (\u00a724, n. 37, 117). Exactly as it was\nthe case there, the judgment exists as long as someone performs the\ncorresponding action of judging; for this reason, it is called a\nnon-enduring product (\u00a723, 116).\n\nNon-enduring products do not exist in actuality separately from the\ncorresponding actions, but only in conjunction with them; we can only\nanalyze them abstractly apart from these actions. On the other hand,\nenduring products can and do exist in actuality apart from the actions\nowing to which they arise (Twardowski 1912, n. 41, 116).\n\nEnduring products last longer than the action which produces\nthem; they originate from a transformation or a rearrangement of\npre-existing physical material in the course of the action: footprints\nin the sand are enduring products arising from the change of\nconfiguration of grains of sand (the material) as a product of the\naction of walking applied to that material (Twardowski points out that\nthe product is not the grains of sand arranged in some way, but the\narrangement itself, \u00a726). If actions are processes, non-enduring\nproducts are events whereas enduring products present\nthemselves as things (\u00a7 27). Among enduring products, we\nfind physical products (such as footprints in the sand) and\npsychophysical products (such as paintings). A mental product, such as\na judgment, is never enduring (\u00a729), but it can have its\nexpression in an enduring psychophysical product, such as a\nwritten sentence. \n\nThe process of preserving non-enduring products such as judgments in\nenduring products such as written sentences is a complex one\n(\u00a737), and goes in two steps. \n\nIn step one a spoken sentence is produced which expresses a judgment,\nin such a way that the judgment is the meaning of the sentence and the\nsentence is the sign of the judgment. The process goes as follows. A\nnon-enduring mental product, a judgment (together with the action of\njudging), which is non-perceptible, gives rise\u2014by being its\n(partial) cause\u2014to a non-enduring psychophysical product, a\nspoken sentence, which is perceptible. In this case, the spoken\nsentence is the expression of the judgment (\u00a730). Now, if\nthe spoken sentence becomes itself a partial cause of another\njudgment, which (we would say) is a token of the same type of the\ninitial judgment (by partially causing an action of judging which\nproduces that other judgment in another person or at a different time\nin the same person), then the spoken sentence can also count as\nthe sign of the judgment, and the judgment as the\nmeaning of the expression (\u00a732, \u00a734). The condition\njust sketched in the antecedent is fundamental: without it, a sentence\np might very well have been an expression of a judgment\nj once (j was a partial cause of p), but no\nmeaning is linked with p: for, if p is incomprehensible,\nnamely it is not a partial cause of another judgment j\u2032,\nthen nothing can be said to be its meaning (\u00a731).\n\nStep two is to preserve the spoken sentence (a non-enduring\npsychophysical product) in an enduring psychophysical product\ns, a written\n sentence.[12]\n When a judgment is preserved in this way, it has in the sign an\nexistence called potential. This is because the sign may at any\nmoment cause the formation of an identical or similar judgment\n(Twardowski 1912, \u00a734), and it will be able to (partially) cause\njudgments as long as it lasts. In consequence of this,\n\u2018meaning\u2019 can therefore also mean \n\nthe capacity to evoke a mental product in the individual on whom a\npsychophysical product acts as a sign of that mental product, or, more\nbriefly, the capacity to bring the corresponding mental product to\nawareness. (Twardowski 1912, n. 51, 125.)\n\n\nOnce they are preserved in this two-step way, non-enduring products\nassume not only the illusory appearance of enduring products, but also\nof products which are somehow independent from the actions\nwhich produce them. The appearance of independence is made stronger by\nthe fact that we do as if one and the same judgment-product existed in\nall individuals, although many judgment-products are elicited\nby the written sentence-product. All these many judgments are\ndifferent from each other, but, insofar as we consider a judgment to\nbe the meaning of a sentence which is its sign\n\nthere must be a group of common attributes in these individual mental\nproducts. And it is precisely these common attributes (in which these\nindividual products accord) that we ordinarily regard as the meaning\nof the psychophysical product, as the content inherent in it, provided\nof course that these common attributes correspond to the intent with\nwhich that psychophysical product was utilized as a sign. [...] Thus,\nwe speak of only a single meaning of a sign\u2014barring cases of\nambiguity\u2014and not of as many meanings as there are mental\nproducts that are aroused or capable of being aroused, by that sign in\nthe persons on whom it acts. Now, a meaning conceived in this matter\nis no longer a concrete mental product, but something at which we\narrive by way of an abstraction performed on concrete products.\n(Twardowski 1912, \u00a739, 128)\n\n\nTo this passage, Twardowski appends a note referring to Husserl's\nnotion of ideal meaning. The relationship between Husserl's and\nTwardowski's notion of meaning as well as the status of Twardowski's\nunique meaning has been and remains object of discussion (see\nPaczkowska-\u0141agowska 1979, Buczy\u0144ska-Garewicz 1980, Placek\n1996, Brandl 1998, Schaar 2015, 108). These matters should be\nconsidered as yet unsettled. \n\nThe introduction of the notion of the unique meaning of a sentence\nleads Twardowski to make a further distinction between substitutive\n(artefacta) and non-substitutive judgments. Substitutive judgments\naren't real judgments, but fictitious ones. The latter are in fact the\npresented judgments of Content and Object; the difference is\nthat in Actions and Products, Twardowski applies the concept of\nsubstitutive judgments explicitly to logic: the sentences uttered or\nwritten by logicians-at-work are not sentences which express or have\nas meanings judgments which are really passed by them, but only\npresented judgments, produced thus by actions of\npresenting\u2014which are different actions from actual judging acts.\nThis happens for instance when a logician constructs a valid syllogism\nmade up of materially false sentences to give examples of formally\nvalid inferences (\u00a744, 130). In this case, the logician does not\nactually judge that all triangles are square, that all squares are\nround, and that all triangles are round, but she merely\npresents the corresponding judgments. The sentences \u2018all\ntriangles are square,\u2019 \u2018all squares are round,\u2019 and\n\u2018all triangles are round\u2019 are not real sentences, but\nartificial ones, because they are \u201cexpressions of artificial\nproducts that substitute for actual judgments, namely merely\nrepresented judgments\u201d (Ibid.). The meanings of these artificial\nsentences are artificial judgments, because they are merely presented,\nnot passed. These artificial judgments are the subject-matter of logic\n(on this point, Twardowski is again indebted to Bolzano). Operating\nwith surrogate sentences such as \u2018all triangles are\nsquare\u2019 constitutes the most extreme example of \u201cmaking\nmental products independent of the actions owing to which alone they\ncan truly (actually) exist\u201d (\u00a744, 131). \n\nTwardowski's distinction between acts and products is presently being\nre-discovered in act-based theories of semantic content, within which\nTwardowski's notion of product is considered an interesting\nalternative to the notion of proposition (as the mind-independent and\nlanguage-independent content of assertions, meaning of sentences,\nprimary truthbearer, and object of propositional attitudes).
