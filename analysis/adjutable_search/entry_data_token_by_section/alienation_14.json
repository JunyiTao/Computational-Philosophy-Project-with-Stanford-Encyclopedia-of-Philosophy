    "main_text": "Alienation and Value || Morality as Alienating\n5.3 Morality as Alienating\n\nThis claim\u2014that alienation might not be a wholly negative\nphenomenon\u2014concerns the normative dimensions of alienation.\nHowever, it is sometimes suggested that the concept of alienation\nmight provide a standpoint from which morality itself, or at least\nsome forms of it, can be criticised. This looks to be a very\ndifferent kind of thought.\n\nThe broad suggestion is that morality, or certain conceptions of\nmorality, might embody, or encourage, alienation. More precisely,\nmorality, or certain conceptions of morality, might embody or\nencourage a problematic division of self and a problematic separation\nfrom much that is valuable in our lives. Consider, for example,\naccounts of the moral standpoint as requiring universalisation and\nequal consideration of all persons (Railton 1984: 138). It could seem\nthat adopting such a standpoint requires individuals to disown or\ndownplay the relevance of their more personal or partial (as opposed to impartial) beliefs and\nfeelings. The picture of persons divided into cognitive and affective\nparts, with the partial and personal relegated to the downgraded\nsphere of the latter (perhaps conceptualised as something closer to\nmere sentiment than reason) is a familiar one. In addition to that\nproblematic bifurcation of the self, such accounts might seem to cut\nus off from much that is valuable in our lives. If these impersonal\nkinds of moral consideration are to dominate our practical reasoning,\nthen it seems likely that an individual\u2019s particular\nattachments, loyalties, and commitments will have, at best, a marginal\nplace (Railton 1984: 139). In aspiring to adopt \u2018the point of\nview of the universe\u2019\u2014to use the well-known phrase of\nHenry Sidgwick (1838\u20131900) \u2013 there can sometimes seem to\nbe precious little security or space remaining for, say, friendship,\nlove, and family (Sidgwick 1907: 382). So understood, morality, or\ncertain conceptions of morality, are charged with embodying and\nencouraging alienation in the form of both a divided self, and a\nseparation of self and world.\n\nThe weight and scope of these kinds of concerns about alienation\ncan obviously vary; that is, they might be thought to have more or\nless critical purchase on a wider or narrower range of targets. There\nare various possibilities here. These concerns might, for\nexample, be said to apply: first, only to certain kinds of personality\ntypes inclined to adopt particular moral theories, and not to the\ntheories themselves (Piper 1987); second, only to certain ways of\nformulating particular moral theories (the objections here being\novercome by a more adequate formulation of\nthe particular theories in question); third, only to particular\nmoral theories (such as act utilitarianism, certain forms of\nconsequentialism, or all impartial moral theories) to which they\nconstitute foundational objections (but not to morality as such);\nand, fourth, as a foundational objection that counts\nagainst \u2018the peculiar institution\u2019 of morality itself\n(Williams 1985: 174). Given both that variety and the subject matter\nof this entry, it may not be helpful to generalise much more here.\nHowever, the point is hopefully made that the ethical dimensions of\nthe present topic extend beyond the normative assessment of the\nrelevant separations. Indeed, taking alienation seriously might lead\nus to think more critically about some familiar moral standpoints and\ntheories.\n",
