Ever since the discovery of the double-helical\nstructure of DNA, geneticists knew what genes were made of and what\nstructure they took. But they did not know how many genes there were.\nAnd with the exception of the handful of genes that had already been\ndiscovered, they did not know where the vast majority of genes were\nlocated. The challenge was to spell out the ordered sequence of the\nhuman genome in its entirety\u2014no small task when you consider\nthat all three billion base pairs of the human genome reside in cells\nno bigger than the period at the end of this sentence. The Human\nGenome Project met the challenge with the largest and most expensive\nbiological collaboration in history. An international consortium of\nscientists at twenty different sequencing centers spread out across\nthe United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and\nChina took charge of different portions, breaking up the entire genome\ninto smaller and smaller overlapping segments until stretches several\nthousand base pairs at a time could be sequenced. Then the whole thing\nwas pasted back together using the areas of overlap as guides. The\nHuman Genome Project was officially completed in 2003 (entry:\n the Human Genome Project).\n\nThe successful completion of the Human Genome Project was met with\nlofty language. The media hailed the effort as uncovering the\n\u201cHoly Grail of biology\u201d, and project leaders compared it\nto splitting the atom and putting a human on the moon. At a\ncelebration of the Human Genome Project in 2003 (for video see\n Other Internet Resources),\n Francis Collins\u2014one of the directors of the effort\u2014boldly\npredicted that the major genes for diabetes, mental illness, asthma,\nand many other diseases would all be discovered in the next few years.\nThese genetic findings, he claimed, would in turn completely transform\nthe way those very common diseases were diagnosed and treated. By\n2010, Collins foresaw a world of individualized medicine where genetic\ntesting was common and physicians tailored treatment plans and\nlifestyle changes all to a patient\u2019s unique DNA. And by 2020, he\nhoped \u201cwe will have a gene-based designer drug available for\nalmost any disease that you can name.\u201d A genomic revolution was\npromised, where traditional \u201cone-size-fits-all medicine\u201d\nwas going to be replaced with \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d\n(entry:\n philosophy of medicine).\n\nInterestingly, while the geneticists and news reporters were looking\nahead to the bright future of personalized medicine, the actual\nresults from the Human Genome Project pointed to a much more\ncomplicated and daunting path ahead. Going into the sequencing,\ngeneticists assumed humans carried over 100,000 genes around with\nthem. Humans are more complex than mice or rice, the thought went, so\nthey should have more genes. Instead, the Human Genome Project\nrevealed that humans bore only 20,000 genes, while mice carried 25,000\nand rice more than 30,000. This gene-count surprise was a strong\nindication that there would be much more to personalized medicine than\nsimply assigning different stretches of DNA to different diseases\n(entry:\n genomics and postgenomics).\n\nWe live now in the postgenomic era. Just what\n\u201cpostgenomic\u201d means, though, is a point of contention. On\nthe one hand, many life sciences have embraced genomics, bringing DNA\nsequencing methods and an attention to genes into their\ndomain\u2014conservation genomics, cancer genomics, behavioral\ngenomics, immunological genomics, bacterial genomics, and marine\ngenomics, to name just a few (entries:\n biodiversity;\n philosophy of immunology;\n conservation biology,\n cancer). On the other hand, it\u2019s become abundantly clear\nthat there is a great deal of complexity between a sequence of DNA and\na trait, and that there are far more variables affecting that trait\nthan just the order of As, Cs, Ts, and Gs. This has spawned the\nproliferation of other \u201comic\u201d disciplines that attempt to\ncatalogue and functionally understand the great variety of molecular\nand cellular entities and processes that contribute to the structure\nand function of organisms\u2014proteomics, transcriptomics,\nmetabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics, to name just a few (entry:\n scientific research and big data).\n What\u2019s more, genome-wide association studies, which scour\nentire genomes for regions that are associated with traits, have\nrevealed that in most case, tens, hundreds, or thousands of genomic\nregions are implicated in even fairly simple human traits like height.\nThis tension\u2014between an urge to trace things down to genes and a\nrealization once you get there that there is far more to the story\nthan genes\u2014is at the heart of many philosophical reflections on\ngenetics (Richardson and Stevens 2015; Reardon 2017; entries:\n genomics and postgenomics;\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology;\n heritability).\n",
