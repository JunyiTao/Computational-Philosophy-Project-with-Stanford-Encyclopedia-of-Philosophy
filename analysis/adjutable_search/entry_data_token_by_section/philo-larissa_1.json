The Evidence for the Development of Philo\u2019s Views\n\nSince the evidence for Philo\u2019s various epistemological views is\nphilosophically rich but radically incomplete, their interpretation is\nunsurprisingly controversial. The primary sources agree that\nPhilo\u2019s views evolved between his election as scholarch in 110/9\nBCE and the publication of the Roman Books in 88 BCE; but the precise\nstages of his epistemological evolution and the arguments that led\nPhilo to change his mind are not explicitly described in the texts we\nhave.\n\nOur evidence indicates (and no scholar disputes this) that Philo began\nas an adherent of the radical skepticism attributed to Carneades by\nClitomachus. The two central questions that the evidence appears to\nleave open are:\n\nDid Philo change his epistemological position in the period\npreceding the Roman Books?\nWhat was the epistemological position of the Roman Books?\n\n\nIn order to understand these questions it is important to know\nsomething about the context in which Philo\u2019s views evolved.\nSeveral sources make it clear that when Philo arrived in Athens in the\n130s BCE, the Academy was sharply divided over the legacy of\nCarneades. One side, led by Clitomachus, advocated radical skepticism\nas the authentic Carneadean position, while another, led by Metrodorus\nof Stratonicea, promoted some form of mitigated skepticism. We know,\nhowever, that Philo was elected scholarch in 110/9 BCE as a\nrepresentative of the Clitomachian, i.e., radically skeptical, wing of\nthe Academy (see Numenius fragment 28). We also know that the\nepistemological views in his Roman Books in 88 BCE were regarded as\nshocking innovations by Academics of all kinds (see Cicero\nAcademica [Ac.] 2.18).\n\nWith respect to the first question, this suggests that, if Philo\nabandoned radical skepticism prior to the Roman Books, then he adopted\nthe form of mitigated skepticism earlier attributed to Carneades by\nMetrodorus. Otherwise he held the same view from the 130s BCE until\nleaving Athens in 89/8 BCE.\n\nOn the second question, about the epistemological position of the\nRoman Books, the limited textual evidence has elicited from\ninterpreters three answers: some form of mitigated skepticism,\nfallibilism, or Platonism. The first answer implies that Philo\u2019s\nview developed once, from radical to mitigated skepticism, whether\nprior to (Sedley 1981; Vezzoli 2011; Tarrant 2018) or in the Roman\nBooks (Glucker 1978; L\u00e9vy 1992, 2010). According to the second\nanswer, the Roman Books adopted a form of fallibilism. Philo\u2019s\ninnovation in the Roman Books may then be understood either as his\nfirst departure from radical skepticism (Hankinson 1995; Thorsrud\n2009) or as a second change of view, now from mitigated skepticism (M.\nFrede 1987; Barnes 1989; Striker 1997; Brittain 2001). The third\nanswer, that the Roman Books advocated a form of Platonism, may\nsimilarly presume Philo\u2019s views developed either once, from\nradical skepticism directly to Platonism (Glidden 1996), or twice,\nfirst from radical skepticism to mitigated skepticism and then to\nPlatonism (Tarrant 1985).\n\nGiven these two questions and the interpretive constraints on their\nanswers, we arrive at a schema of five accounts of Philo\u2019s\nepistemological development:\n\nRadical Skepticism \u2192 Mitigated Skepticism\nRadical Skepticism \u2192 Fallibilism\nRadical Skepticism \u2192 Platonism\nRadical Skepticism \u2192 Mitigated Skepticism \u2192\nFallibilism\nRadical Skepticism \u2192 Mitigated Skepticism \u2192\nPlatonism\n\n\nThe resolution of these questions depends primarily on an\ninterpretation of Cicero\u2019s Academica, our principal,\nand only first-hand, philosophical source for Academic skepticism. But\nthis text strongly suggests Philo held three epistemological positions\nover his career, since Cicero identifies and distinguishes three\npositions held by different Academics in Philo\u2019s lifetime: a\nradical skepticism associated with Clitomachus (e.g., in Ac.\n2.78, 2.108); a form of mitigated skepticism held by a group of\nAcademics who regarded it as incompatible with the Roman Books\n(Ac.\u00a02.148, 2.11\u201312 & 2.18); and the Roman\nBook view (Ac.\u00a02.18). So it is clear that the Roman\nBooks did represent a third distinct Academic position. It also seems\nclear that they represented Philo\u2019s third\nepistemological view, because the interpretation of Carneades that\ngenerated the second view is explicitly tied to Philo and Metrodorus\n(Ac. 2.78, cf. 2.148), while we know that the Roman Books\noffered a novel interpretation of Arcesilaus and Carneades that was\ncontested by the proponents of the second view (Ac.\n2.11\u201312, 2.18). We can thus safely infer, in response to the\nfirst question above, that Philo advocated mitigated skepticism at\nsome point in the 90s BCE, prior to the Roman Books of 88 BCE and\nafter his election to the scholarchate as a Clitomachian radical\nskeptic in 110/9 BCE. That this is correct is confirmed by the\ncriticisms of mitigated skepticism aimed at Philo by his student\nAntiochus before the Roman Books (see\n section 3.4\n below), and by the fact that virtually all the generic references to\nAcademic skepticism in later writers assume that it was a form of\nmitigated skepticism (see, e.g., Gellius Attic Nights 11.5.8,\nPhotius Library 212.170a, Plutarch Stoic\nContradictions ch. 10, and Sextus Outlines of Skepticism\n[PH] 1.226\u201331). Since Metrodorus was regarded as\nunorthodox, the only plausible candidate for the creation of this\nreceived view of Academic skepticism is a work by Philo from the 90s\nBCE.\n\nThe second question above is much simpler to dispose of once the first\nhas been resolved. If Philo had previously been a mitigated skeptic\nand the Roman Books presented an epistemological innovation, his final\nposition was not mitigated skepticism. But we have excellent evidence\nthat it wasn\u2019t a (recognizable) form of Platonism, since\nAntiochus and Numenius flatly rejected it, despite being avowed\nrevivers of Platonism. (The only evidence in favor of the Platonist\nhypothesis is an explicitly unsupported fantasy in Augustine, to the\neffect that Platonist doctrines were secretly taught in the Academy\nthroughout its skeptical phase [Against the Academics\n3.37\u201343].) The fallibilist interpretation of the Roman Books is\nthus at least prima facie the most plausible candidate\noffered to date. Whether it is in fact a satisfying candidate will\ndepend on its ability to present a coherent philosophical\ninterpretation of the development of Philo\u2019s epistemological\nviews from the evidence we have.\n\nThe following sections thus offer an interpretation of Philo\u2019s\nphilosophical development on the hypothesis that he held three\ndistinct epistemological views, as proposed by the Radical Skepticism\n\u2192 Mitigated Skepticism \u2192 Fallibilism account above. It is\nworth stressing, however, that, given the uncertainties of our\nevidence, the exegetical and historical arguments above cannot be\nregarded as conclusive. The case is not closed (see, e.g., Glucker\n2004 and Tarrant 2018).\n",
