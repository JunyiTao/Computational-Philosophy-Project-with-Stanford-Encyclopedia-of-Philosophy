The concept of information potentially\nhas an impact on almost all philosophical main disciplines, ranging\nfrom logic, theory of knowledge, to ontology and even ethics and\nesthetics (see introduction above). Philosophy of science and\nphilosophy of information, with their interest in the problem of\ninduction and theory formation, probably both could benefit from\ncloser cooperation (see\n 4.1 Popper: Information as degree of falsifiability).\n The concept of information plays an important role in the history of\nphilosophy that is not completely understood (see\n 2. History of the term and the concept of information).\n \n\nAs information has become a central issue in almost all of the\nsciences and humanities this development will also impact\nphilosophical reflection in these areas. Archaeologists, linguists,\nphysicists, astronomers all deal with information. The first thing a\nscientist has to do before he can formulate a theory is gathering\ninformation. The application possibilities are abundant. Datamining\nand the handling of extremely large data sets seems to be an essential\nfor almost every empirical discipline in the twenty-first century.\n\nIn biology we have found out that information is essential for the\norganization of life itself and for the propagation of complex\norganisms (see entry on\n biological information).\n One of the main problems is that current models do not explain the\ncomplexity of life well. Valiant has started a research program that\nstudies evolution as a form of computational learning (Valiant 2009)\nin order to explain this discrepancy. Aaronson (2013) has argued\nexplicitly for a closer cooperation between complexity theory and\nphilosophy.\n\nUntil recently the general opinion was that the various notions of\ninformation were more or less isolated but in recent years\nconsiderable progress has been made in the understanding of the\nrelationship between these concepts. Cover and Thomas (2006), for\ninstance, see a perfect match between Kolmogorov complexity and\nShannon information. Similar observations have been made by\nGr\u00fcnwald and Vit\u00e1nyi (2008). Also the connections that\nexist between the theory of thermodynamics and information theory have\nbeen studied (Bais & Farmer 2008; Harremo\u00ebs &\nTops\u00f8e 2008) and it is clear that the connections between\nphysics and information theory are much more elaborate than a mere\nad hoc similarity between the formal treatment of entropy and\ninformation suggests (Gell-Mann & Lloyd 2003; Verlinde (2011,\n2017). Quantum computing is at this moment not developed to a point\nwhere it is effectively more powerful than classical computing, but\nthis threshold might be passed in the coming years. From the point of\nview of philosophy many conceptual problems of quantum physics and\ninformation theory seem to merge into one field of related questions:\n\n\nWhat is the relation between information and computation?\nIs computation in the real world fundamentally\nnon-deterministic?\n What is the relation between symbol manipulation on a macroscopic\nscale and the world of quantum physics? \n What is a good model of quantum computing and how do we control\nits power? \n Is there information beyond the world of quanta?\n\n\nThe notion of information has become central in both our society and\nin the sciences. Information technology plays a pivotal role in the\nway we organize our lives. It also has become a basic category in the\nsciences and the humanities. Philosophy of information, both as a\nhistorical and a systematic discipline, offers a new perspective on\nold philosophical problems and also suggests new research domains.\n",
