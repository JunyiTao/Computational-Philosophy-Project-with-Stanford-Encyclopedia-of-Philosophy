It is widely held\nthat the most powerful argument in favour of scientific realism is the\nno-miracles argument, according to which the success of science would\nbe miraculous if scientific theories were not at least approximately\ntrue descriptions of the world. While the underdetermination argument\nis often cited as giving grounds for scepticism about theories of\nunobservable entities, arguably the most powerful arguments against\nscientific realism are based on the history of radical theory change\nin science. The best-known of these arguments, although perhaps not\nthe most compelling of them, is the pessimistic meta-induction,\naccording to which reflection on the abandonment of theories in the\nhistory of science supports the expectation that our best current\nscientific theories will themselves be abandoned, and hence that we\nought not to assent to them. (See\n \u00a72\n below and the entry on\n scientific realism\n for more on these arguments.)\n\nStructural realism was introduced into current philosophy of science\nby John Worrall in 1989 as a way to break the impasse that results\nfrom taking both arguments seriously, and have \u201cthe best of both\nworlds\u201d in the debate about scientific realism. With respect to\nthe case of the transition in nineteenth-century optics from\nFresnel\u2019s elastic solid ether theory to Maxwell\u2019s theory\nof the electromagnetic field, Worrall argues that:\n\n\nThere was an important element of continuity in the shift from Fresnel\nto Maxwell\u2014and this was much more than a simple question of\ncarrying over the successful empirical content into the new theory. At\nthe same time it was rather less than a carrying over of the full\ntheoretical content or full theoretical mechanisms (even in\n\u201capproximate\u201d form) \u2026 There was continuity or\naccumulation in the shift, but the continuity is one of form or\nstructure, not of content. (1989: 117)\n\n\nAccording to Worrall, we should not accept standard scientific\nrealism, which asserts that the nature of the unobservable objects\nthat cause the phenomena we observe is correctly described by our best\ntheories. However, neither should we be antirealists about science.\nRather, we should adopt structural realism and epistemically commit\nourselves to the mathematical or structural content of our theories.\nSince there is (says Worrall) retention of structure across theory\nchange, structural realism both (a) avoids the force of the\npessimistic meta-induction (by not committing us to belief in the\ntheory\u2019s description of the furniture of the world) and (b) does\nnot make the success of science (especially the novel predictions of\nmature physical theories) seem miraculous (by committing us to the\nclaim that the theory\u2019s structure, over and above its empirical\ncontent, describes the world).\n\nWorrall\u2019s paper has been widely cited in an extensive literature\nin which various varieties of structural realism are advocated or\ncriticised, and different notions of structure are discussed. These\ncontemporary debates recapitulate the work of some of the greatest\nphilosophers of science of the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies. The increasing mathematisation of physics through the\nnineteenth century, with electromagnetism and thermodynamics lacking\nmechanical and material models, and then the advent of quantum and\nrelativity physics, prompted a variety of structuralist responses.\nWorrall says he found his structural realism in Henri Poincar\u00e9\n(1902 [1905]; 1905 [1907]) whose structuralism was combined with\nneo-Kantian views about the nature of arithmetic and group theory, and\nwith conventionalism about the geometry of space and time. (The\nprevalence of Kantian themes in the literature on structural realism\nis discussed further below; for more on Poincar\u00e9 and structural\nrealism see Giedymin 1982; Gower 2000; and Zahar 1996, 2001, and\nbelow.) Ernan McMullin (1990) argues that Pierre Duhem was a realist\nabout the relations found in laws but not about explanations in terms\nof an ontology. According to Worrall (1989), Barry Gower (2000) and\nElie Zahar (2001), Duhem too was a kind of structural realist, though\nthere are passages in Duhem that more readily lend themselves to an\ninstrumentalist interpretation (see the entry on\n Pierre Duhem).\n Milena Ivanova (2015a) compares the thought of Duhem and\nPoincar\u00e9 in respect of conventionalism and structural realism,\nidentifying significant differences between their views as well as\nsimilarities. Gower\u2019s (2000) historical survey of structural\nrealism discusses how it figures in the thought of Ernst Cassirer,\nMoritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap and Bertrand Russell. Stathis Psillos\n(1999) explores the connections between structuralism and the\nRamsey-sentence approach to scientific theory in the development of\nCarnap\u2019s philosophy from logical positivism to ontologically\nrelativist empiricism (Ramsey sentences are discussed in\n \u00a73.2\n below). Other important pioneers of structuralism about science\ninclude Arthur Eddington (see French 2003), Grover Maxwell (see\nLadyman 1998 and\n \u00a73.1\n below) and Hermann Weyl (see Ryckman 2005).\n\nLadyman (1998) distinguished epistemic and ontic forms of structural\nrealism in arguing for the latter. Many of those who have taken up\nstructural realism have been philosophers of physics who have\ndeveloped various forms of ontic structural realism, most notably\nSteven French. Others, including Worrall, have made it clear that\ntheir structural realism is a purely epistemological refinement of\nscientific realism. On the other hand, Bas van Fraassen (1997, 2006,\n2007, 2008) defends an empiricist and non-realist form of\nstructuralism about science, based on his view of scientific\nrepresentation and motivated by an illuminating reconstruction of the\norigins of structuralism in the debate about the epistemology of\nphysical geometry in the nineteenth century (see also Bueno 1999, 2000\non structural empiricism). Other kinds of structuralism abound in\ncurrent analytic philosophy. These include causal structuralism\nconcerning the individuation of properties, mathematical structuralism\nconcerning the nature of mathematical objects, and structuralism about\nlaws and dispositions. Following the debates about structural realism\nin the philosophy of science in the early twentieth century, the\nnotion of structure in general, and the idea of modal structure in\nparticular, have also become prominent in analytic metaphysics.\nClearly, there many different notions of structure, and many different\nkinds of structural realism. This article reviews the main issues and\nprovides a guide for further reading.\n",
