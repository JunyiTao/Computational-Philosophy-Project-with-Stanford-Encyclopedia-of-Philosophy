    "main_text": "The Good: Political Theory, Ethical Theory and Religion in the Enlightenment || Political Theory\n2.1 Political Theory\n\nThe Enlightenment is most identified with its political\naccomplishments. The era is marked by three political revolutions,\nwhich together lay the basis for modern, republican, constitutional\ndemocracies: The English Revolution (1688), the American Revolution\n(1775\u201383), and the French Revolution (1789\u201399). The\nsuccess at explaining and understanding the natural world encourages\nthe Enlightenment project of re-making the social/political world, in\naccord with the models we allegedly find in our reason. Enlightenment\nphilosophers find that the existing social and political orders do not\nwithstand critical scrutiny. Existing political and social authority\nis shrouded in religious myth and mystery and founded on obscure\ntraditions. The criticism of existing institutions is supplemented\nwith the positive work of constructing in theory the model of\ninstitutions as they ought to be. We owe to this period the basic\nmodel of government founded upon the consent of the governed; the\narticulation of the political ideals of freedom and equality and the\ntheory of their institutional realization; the articulation of a list\nof basic individual human rights to be respected and realized by any\nlegitimate political system; the articulation and promotion of\ntoleration of religious diversity as a virtue to be respected in a\nwell ordered society; the conception of the basic political powers as\norganized in a system of checks and balances; and other now-familiar\nfeatures of western democracies. However, for all the enduring\naccomplishments of Enlightenment political philosophy, it is not clear\nthat human reason proves powerful enough to put a concrete, positive\nauthoritative ideal in place of the objects of its criticism. As in\nthe epistemological domain, reason shows its power more convincingly\nin criticizing authorities than in establishing them. Here too the\nquestion of the limits of reason is one of the main philosophical\nlegacies of the period. These limits are arguably vividly illustrated\nby the course of the French Revolution. The explicit ideals of the\nFrench Revolution are the Enlightenment ideals of individual freedom\nand equality; but, as the revolutionaries attempt to devise rational,\nsecular institutions to put in place of those they have violently\noverthrown, eventually they have recourse to violence and terror in\norder to control and govern the people. The devolution of the French\nRevolution into the Reign of Terror is perceived by many as proving\nthe emptiness and hypocrisy of Enlightenment reason, and is one of the\nmain factors which account for the end of the Enlightenment as an\nhistorical period.\n\nThe political revolutions of the Enlightenment, especially the French\nand the American, were informed and guided to a significant extent by\nprior political philosophy in the period. Though Thomas Hobbes, in his\nLeviathan (1651), defends the absolute power of the political\nsovereign, and is to that extent opposed to the revolutionaries and\nreformers in England, this work is a founding work of Enlightenment\npolitical theory. Hobbes\u2019 work originates the modern social\ncontract theory, which incorporates Enlightenment conceptions of the\nrelation of the individual to the state. According to the general\nsocial contract model, political authority is grounded in an agreement\n(often understood as ideal, rather than real) among individuals, each\nof whom aims in this agreement to advance his rational self-interest\nby establishing a common political authority over all. Thus, according\nto the general contract model (though this is more clear in later\ncontract theorists such as Locke and Rousseau than in Hobbes himself),\npolitical authority is grounded not in conquest, natural or divinely\ninstituted hierarchy, or in obscure myths and traditions, but rather\nin the rational consent of the governed. In initiating this model,\nHobbes takes a naturalistic, scientific approach to the question of\nhow political society ought to be organized (against the background of\na clear-eyed, unsentimental conception of human nature), and thus\ndecisively influences the Enlightenment process of secularization and\nrationalization in political and social philosophy.\n\nBaruch Spinoza also greatly contributes to the development of\nEnlightenment political philosophy in its early years. The\nmetaphysical doctrines of the Ethics (1677) lay the\ngroundwork for his influence on the age. Spinoza\u2019s arguments\nagainst Cartesian dualism and in favor of substance monism, the claim\nin particular that there can only be one substance, God or nature, was\ntaken to have radical implications in the domains of politics, ethics\nand religion throughout the period. Spinoza\u2019s employment of\nphilosophical reason leads to the denial of the existence of a\ntranscendent, creator, providential, law-giving God; this establishes\nthe opposition between the teachings of philosophy, on the one hand,\nand the traditional orienting practical beliefs (moral, religious,\npolitical) of the people, on the other hand, an opposition that is one\nimportant aspect of the culture of the Enlightenment. In his main\npolitical work, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (1677),\nSpinoza, building on his rationalist naturalism, opposes superstition,\nargues for toleration and the subordination of religion to the state,\nand pronounces in favor of qualified democracy. Liberalism is perhaps\nthe most characteristic political philosophy of the Enlightenment, and\nSpinoza, in this text primarily, is one of its originators.\n\nHowever, John Locke\u2019s Second Treatise of\nGovernment (1690) is the classical source of modern liberal\npolitical theory. In his First Treatise of Government, Locke\nattacks Robert Filmer\u2019s Patriarcha (1680), which\nepitomizes the sort of political theory the Enlightenment opposes.\nFilmer defends the right of kings to exercise absolute authority over\ntheir subjects on the basis of the claim that they inherit the\nauthority God vested in Adam at creation. Though Locke\u2019s\nassertion of the natural freedom and equality of human beings in the\nSecond Treatise is starkly and explicitly opposed to\nFilmer\u2019s view, it is striking that the cosmology underlying\nLocke\u2019s assertions is closer to Filmer\u2019s than to\nSpinoza\u2019s. According to Locke, in order to understand the nature\nand source of legitimate political authority, we have to understand\nour relations in the state of nature. Drawing upon the natural law\ntradition, Locke argues that it is evident to our natural reason that\nwe are all absolutely subject to our Lord and Creator, but that, in\nrelation to each other, we exist naturally in a state of equality\n\u201cwherein all the power and jurisdiction is reciprocal, no one\nhaving more than another\u201d (Second Treatise, \u00a74).\nWe also exist naturally in a condition of freedom, insofar as we may\ndo with ourselves and our possessions as we please, within the\nconstraints of the fundamental law of nature. The law of nature\n\u201cteaches all mankind \u2026 that, being all equal and\nindependent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health,\nliberty, or possessions\u201d (\u00a76). That we are governed in our\nnatural condition by such a substantive moral law, legislated by God\nand known to us through our natural reason, implies that the state of\nnature is not Hobbes\u2019 war of all against all. However, since\nthere is lacking any human authority over all to judge of disputes and\nenforce the law, it is a condition marred by\n\u201cinconveniencies\u201d, in which possession of natural freedom,\nequality and possessions is insecure. According to Locke, we\nrationally quit this natural condition by contracting together to set\nover ourselves a political authority, charged with promulgating and\nenforcing a single, clear set of laws, for the sake of guaranteeing\nour natural rights, liberties and possessions. The civil, political\nlaw, founded ultimately upon the consent of the governed, does not\ncancel the natural law, according to Locke, but merely serves to draw\nthat law closer. \u201c[T]he law of nature stands as an eternal rule\nto all men\u201d (\u00a7135). Consequently, when established\npolitical power violates that law, the people are justified in\noverthrowing it. Locke\u2019s argument for the right to revolt\nagainst a government that opposes the purposes for which legitimate\ngovernment is taken by some to justify the political revolution in the\ncontext of which he writes (the English revolution) and, almost a\nhundred years later, by others to justify the American revolution as\nwell.\n\nThough Locke\u2019s liberalism has been tremendously influential, his\npolitical theory is founded on doctrines of natural law and religion\nthat are not nearly as evident as Locke assumes. Locke\u2019s\nreliance on the natural law tradition is typical of Enlightenment\npolitical and moral theory. According to the natural law tradition, as\nthe Enlightenment makes use of it, we can know through the use of our\nunaided reason that we all \u2013 all human beings, universally\n\u2013 stand in particular moral relations to each other. The claim\nthat we can apprehend through our unaided reason a universal\nmoral order exactly because moral qualities and relations (in\nparticular human freedom and equality) belong to the nature of things,\nis attractive in the Enlightenment for obvious reasons. However, as\nnoted above, the scientific apprehension of nature in the period does\nnot support, and in fact opposes, the claim that the alleged moral\nqualities and relations (or, indeed, that any moral qualities\nand relations) are natural. According to a common\nEnlightenment assumption, as humankind clarifies the laws of nature\nthrough the advance of natural science and philosophy, the true moral\nand political order will be revealed with it. This view is expressed\nexplicitly by the philosophe Marquis de Condorcet, in his\nSketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human\nMind (published posthumously in 1795 and which, perhaps better\nthan any other work, lays out the paradigmatically Enlightenment view\nof history of the human race as a continual progress to perfection).\nBut, in fact, advance in knowledge of the laws of nature in the\nscience of the period does not help with discernment of a natural\npolitical or moral order. This asserted relationship between natural\nscientific knowledge and the political and moral order is under great\nstress already in the Enlightenment. With respect to Lockean\nliberalism, though his assertion of the moral and political claims\n(natural freedom, equality, et cetera) continues to have considerable\nforce for us, the grounding of these claims in a religious cosmology\ndoes not. The question of how to ground our claims to natural freedom\nand equality is one of the main philosophical legacies of the\nEnlightenment.\n\nThe rise and development of liberalism in Enlightenment political\nthought has many relations with the rise of the mercantile class (the\nbourgeoisie) and the development of what comes to be called\n\u201ccivil society\u201d, the society characterized by work and\ntrade in pursuit of private property. Locke\u2019s Second\nTreatise contributes greatly to the project of articulating a\npolitical philosophy to serve the interests and values of this\nascending class. Locke claims that the end or purpose of political\nsociety is the preservation and protection of property (though he\ndefines property broadly to include not only external property but\nlife and liberties as well). According to Locke\u2019s famous\naccount, persons acquire rightful ownership in external things that\nare originally given to us all by God as a common inheritance,\nindependently of the state and prior to its involvement, insofar as we\n\u201cmix our labor with them\u201d. The civil freedom that Locke\ndefines, as something protected by the force of political laws, comes\nincreasingly to be interpreted as the freedom to trade, to exchange\nwithout the interference of governmental regulation. Within the\ncontext of the Enlightenment, economic freedom is a salient\ninterpretation of the individual freedom highly valued in the period.\nAdam Smith, a prominent member of the Scottish Enlightenment,\ndescribes in his An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the\nWealth of Nations (1776) some of the laws of civil society, as a\nsphere distinct from political society as such, and thus contributes\nsignificantly to the founding of political economy (later called\nmerely \u201ceconomics\u201d). His is one of many voices in the\nEnlightenment advocating for free trade and for minimal government\nregulation of markets. The trading house floor, in which people of\nvarious nationalities, languages, cultures, religions come together\nand trade, each in pursuit of his own self-interest, but, through this\npursuit, supplying the wants of their respective nations and\nincreasing its wealth, represents for some Enlightenment thinkers the\nbenign, peaceful, universal rational order that they wish to see\nreplace the violent, confessional strife that characterized the\nthen-recent past of Europe.\n\nHowever, the liberal conception of the government as properly\nprotecting economic freedom of citizens and private property comes\ninto conflict in the Enlightenment with the value of democracy. James\nMadison confronts this tension in the context of arguing for the\nadoption of the U.S. Constitution (in his Federalist #10). Madison\nargues that popular government (pure democracy) is subject to the evil\nof factions; in a pure democracy, a majority bound together by a\nprivate interest, relative to the whole, has the capacity to impose\nits particular will on the whole. The example most on Madison\u2019s\nmind is that those without property (the many) may seek to bring about\ngovernmental re-distribution of the property of the propertied class\n(the few), perhaps in the name of that other Enlightenment ideal,\nequality. If, as in Locke\u2019s theory, the government\u2019s\nprotection of an individual\u2019s freedom is encompassed within the\ngeneral end of protecting a person\u2019s property, then, as Madison\nargues, the proper form of the government cannot be pure democracy,\nand the will of the people must be officially determined in some other\nway than by directly polling the people.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s political theory, as presented in his\nOn the Social Contract (1762), presents a contrast to the\nLockean liberal model. Though commitment to the political ideals of\nfreedom and equality constitutes a common ground for Enlightenment\npolitical philosophy, it is not clear not only how these values have a\nhome in nature as Enlightenment science re-conceives it, but also how\nconcretely to interpret each of these ideals and how properly to\nbalance them against each other. Contrary to Madison, Rousseau argues\nthat direct (pure) democracy is the only form of government in which\nhuman freedom can be realized. Human freedom, according to\nRousseau\u2019s interpretation, is possible only through governance\naccording to what he calls \u201cthe general will,\u201d which is\nthe will of the body politic, formed through the original contract,\nconcretely determined in an assembly in which all citizens\nparticipate. Rousseau\u2019s account intends to avert the evils of\nfactions by structural elements of the original contract. The contract\nconsists in the self-alienation by each associate of all rights and\npossessions to the body politic. Because each alienates all, each is\nan equal member of the body politic, and the terms and conditions are\nthe same for all. The emergence of factions is avoided insofar as the\ngood of each citizen is, and is understood to be, equally (because\nwholly) dependent on the general will. Legislation supports this\nidentification with the general will by preserving the original\nequality established in the contract, prominently through maintaining\na measure of economic equality. Rousseau\u2019s account of the ideal\nrelation of the individual citizen to the state differs from\nLocke\u2019s; in Rousseau\u2019s account, the individual must be\nactively engaged in political life in order to maintain the\nidentification of his supremely authoritative will with the general\nwill, whereas in Locke the emphasis is on the limits of governmental\nauthority with respect to the expressions of the individual will.\nThough Locke\u2019s liberal model is more representative of the\nEnlightenment in general, Rousseau\u2019s political theory, which in\nsome respects presents a revived classical model modified within the\ncontext of Enlightenment values, in effect poses many of the enduring\nquestions regarding the meaning and interpretation of political\nfreedom and equality within the modern state.\n\nBoth Madison and Rousseau, like most political thinkers of the period,\nare influenced by Baron de Montesquieu\u2019s The Spirit of the\nLaws (1748), which is one of the founding texts of modern\npolitical theory. Though Montesquieu\u2019s treatise belongs to the\ntradition of liberalism in political theory, given his scientific\napproach to social, legal and political systems, his influence extends\nbeyond this tradition. Montesquieu argues that the system of\nlegislation for a people varies appropriately with the particular\ncircumstances of the people. He provides specific analysis of how\nclimate, fertility of the soil, population size, et cetera, affect\nlegislation. He famously distinguishes three main forms of\ngovernments: republics (which can either be democratic or\naristocratic), monarchies and despotisms. He describes leading\ncharacteristics of each. His argument that functional democracies\nrequire the population to possess civic virtue in high measure, a\nvirtue that consists in valuing public good above private interest,\ninfluences later Enlightenment theorists, including both Rousseau and\nMadison. He describes the threat of factions to which Madison and\nRousseau respond in different (indeed opposite) ways. He provides the\nbasic structure and justification for the balance of political powers\nthat Madison later incorporates into the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt is striking how unenlightened many of the Enlightenment\u2019s\ncelebrated thinkers are concerning issues of race and of gender\n(regarding race, see Race and Enlightenment: A Reader, edited\nby Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze). For all the public concern with the\nallegedly universal \u201crights of man\u201d in the Enlightenment,\nthe rights of women and of non-white people are generally overlooked\nin the period. (Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s Vindication of the\nRights of Woman (1792) is a noteworthy exception.) When\nEnlightenment thinkers do turn their attention to the social standing\nof women or of non-white people, they tend to spout unreasoned\nprejudice. Moreover, while the philosophies of the Enlightenment\ngenerally aspire or pretend to universal truth, unattached to\nparticular time, place or culture, Enlightenment writings are rife\nwith rank ethno- and Eurocentrism, often explicit.\n\nIn the face of such tensions within the Enlightenment, one response is\nto affirm the power of the Enlightenment to improve humanity and\nsociety long beyond the end of the eighteenth century, indeed, down to\nthe present day and into the future. This response embraces the\nEnlightenment and interprets more recent emancipation movements and\nachievement of recognition of the rights and dignity of traditionally\noppressed and marginalized groups as expressions of Enlightenment\nideals and aspirations. Critics of the Enlightenment respond\ndifferently to such tensions. Critics see them as symptoms of\ndisorder, ideology, perversity, futility or falsehood that afflict the\nvery core of the Enlightenment itself. (See James Schmidt\u2019s\n\u201cWhat Enlightenment Project?\u201d for discussion of critics of\nthe Enlightenment.) Famously, Adorno and Horkheimer interpret Nazi\ndeath camps as the result of \u201cthe dialectic of the\nEnlightenment\u201d, as what historically becomes of the supremacy of\ninstrumental reason asserted in the Enlightenment. As another example,\nwe may point to some post-modern feminists, who argue, in opposition\nto the liberal feminists who embrace broadly Enlightenment ideals and\nconceptions, that the essentialism and universalism associated with\nEnlightenment ideals are both false and intrinsically hostile to the\naspirations to self-realization of women and of other traditionally\noppressed groups. (See Strickland and the essays in Akkerman and\nStuurman.) This entry is not the place to delineate strains of\nopposition to the Enlightenment, but it is worth noting that\npost-Enlightenment social and political struggles to achieve equality\nor recognition for traditionally marginalized or oppressed groups are\nsometimes self-consciously grounded in the Enlightenment and sometimes\nmarked by explicit opposition to the Enlightenment\u2019s conceptions\nor presuppositions.\n",
