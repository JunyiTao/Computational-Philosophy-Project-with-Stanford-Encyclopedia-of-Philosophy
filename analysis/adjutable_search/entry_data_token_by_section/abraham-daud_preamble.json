    "main_text": "\n\n\nAbraham ibn Daud (c.1110\u20131180) can be regarded as a pioneer in\nJewish philosophy. His philosophical treatise ha-Emunah\nha-Ramah (The Exalted Faith, c. 1160) constitutes the first\nsystematic attempt to integrate Aristotelianism into Jewish thought.\nHowever, only a few decades later Moses Maimonides, the medieval Jewish\nphilosopher par excellence, wrote his philosophical magnum\nopus, Moreh Nevukhim (The Guide of the Perplexed), a work\nthat has much in common with Ibn Daud\u2019s book. As a result,\nha-Emunah ha-Ramah was soon superseded. However, traces of\nits influence are visible in later medieval Jewish thought. This\narticle will survey Ibn Daud\u2019s major ideas and examine his\ncontribution to medieval Jewish philosophy.\n",
