The work of psychologist Carol Gilligan therefore has great\ninfluence on philosophers interested in just such evidence for\nsubstantial sex differences in moral reasoning, despite the fact that\nGilligan herself does not describe these differences as polar. In her\nlandmark work, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and\nWomen\u2019s Development (1982), Gilligan disputes accounts of\nmoral development that do not take into account girls\u2019 moral\nexperiences (18\u201319), or that describe women as stuck at an\ninterpersonal stage short of full moral development as in the theories\nof Lawrence Kohlberg (30). Gilligan argues that Kohlberg wrongly\nprioritizes a \u201cmorality of rights\u201d and independence from\nothers as better than, rather than merely different from, a\n\u201cmorality of responsibility\u201d and intimate relationships\nwith others (19).\n\nGilligan\u2019s research follows Nancy Chodorow\u2019s in suggesting\nthat for boys and men, \u201cseparation and individuation are\ncritically tied to gender identity\u201d (Gilligan 1982, 8). Further,\nthe development of masculinity typically involves valuing autonomy,\nrights, disconnection from others, and independence, while seeing\nother persons and intimate relationships as dangers or obstacles to\npursuing those values. This perspective is referred to as the\n\u201cperspective of justice\u201d (Held 1995; Blum 1988). Women, in\nGilligan\u2019s studies, were as likely to express the perspective of\njustice as they were to express a perspective that valued intimacy,\nresponsibility, relationships, and caring for others, while seeing\nautonomy as \u201cthe illusory and dangerous quest\u201d (Gilligan\n1982, 48), in tension with the values of attachment. This perspective\nis known as the perspective of \u201ccare\u201d (Friedman 1991;\nDriver 2005).\n\nPhilosophers who apply Gilligan\u2019s empirical results to ethical\ntheory differ about the role that a care perspective should play in\nnormative recommendations. Nel Noddings\u2019s influential work,\nCaring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education\n(1984), argues for the moral preferability of a care perspective as\nboth feminine and, as she later says explicitly, feminist (Noddings\n2013, xxiv), orienting moral agents to focus on the needs of those one\ncares for in relational contexts rather than on abstract, universal\nprinciples. Like her historical predecessors discussed above, Noddings\nemphasizes the feminine \u201cto direct attention to centuries of\nexperience more typical of women than men\u201d (xxiv), in part to\ncorrect the extent to which \u201cthe mother\u2019s voice has been\nsilent\u201d (1). Noddings\u2019s normative theory endorses the\nmoral value of partiality that justifies prioritizing interpersonal\nrelationships over more distant connections. Virginia Held\u2019s\n(1993; 2006) and Joan Tronto\u2019s (1993) different applications of\nthe perspective of care endorse care as social and political rather\nthan limited to interpersonal relationships, and suggest that an ethic\nof care provides a route to realizing better societies as well as\nbetter treatment of distant others. Both Held and Sara Ruddick (1989)\nurge societal shifts to prioritize children\u2019s vulnerabilities\nand the perspectives of mothers as necessary correctives to moral and\npolitical neglect of policies that would ensure the well-being of\nvulnerable people in relationships requiring care. This concern is\nfurther elaborated in Eva Feder Kittay\u2019s attention to caregivers\nas \u201csecondarily\u201d or \u201cderivatively dependent\u201d\n(1999). In normative theory and applied ethics, care-work and caring\nin workplace relationships have come to receive more attention in\ntwenty-first century philosophy than previously, as appreciation for\nthe ethical demands of relational support-provision and\nclient-centered or helping professions come to be influenced by\nvariations on the ethic of care (Kittay 1999; Feder and Kittay 2002;\nTronto 2005; Lanoix 2010; Reiheld 2015).\n\nRobin Dillon observes that, \u201cCare ethics was for some time the\ndominant approach in feminist ethics and so feminist discussions of\nvirtue\u201d (2017b, 574). Although the ethic of care continues to be\nstrongly associated with feminist ethics, Gilligan\u2019s work in\npsychology and Noddings\u2019s work in philosophy were immediately\ncontested (Superson 2012). Some feminist ethicists have argued that\nthe ethic of care valorizes the burdened history of femininity\nassociated with caring (Card 1996). The complex history of femininity\nand caregiving practices were shaped in contexts of oppression that\nmay permit \u201cmoral damage\u201d to women\u2019s agency (Tessman\n2005). If that burdened feminine history includes attention to\nparticular relationships at the expense of attention to wider social\ninstitutions and systematic political injustice, then the ethic of\ncare runs the risk of lacking a feminist vision for changing\nsystematic and institutional forms of oppression (Hoagland 1990; Bell\n1993). Further worries about the ethic of care include whether\nunidirectional caring enables the exploitation of caregivers (Houston\n1990; Card 1990; Davion 1993), and whether such caring excludes moral\nresponsibilities to strangers and individuals we may affect without\nmeeting interpersonally (Card 1990), thereby risking an insular ethic\nthat ignores political and material realities (Hoagland 1990). Another\nconcern is whether we risk generalizing some women\u2019s\nprioritizing caring to all women, which disregards the complex\npluralism of many women\u2019s voices (Moody-Adams 1991). Finally,\npreoccupation with women\u2019s kinder and gentler feelings may\nprevent or distract from attention to women\u2019s capacities for\nharm and injustice, especially the injustices borne of racial and\nclass privilege (Spelman 1991).\n\nThe above criticisms tend to proceed from a view that it is\nproblematic that an ethic of care is predicated on seeing femininity\nas valuable. They suggest that critical feminist perspectives require\nus to doubt the value of femininity. However, it remains controversial\nwhether femininity is necessarily defined in relationship to\nmasculinity and is thereby an inauthentic or insufficiently critical\nperspective for feminist ethics, or whether femininity is a\ndistinctive contribution of moral and valuing agents to a feminist\nproject that rejects or corrects some of the errors and excesses of\nlegacies of masculinity (Irigaray 1985; Harding 1987; Tong 1993;\nBartky 1990).\n",
