    "main_text": "From Mendelian Research and Models to the Present: Advances, Ambiguities and Persisting Questions || Particulate Factors\u2014Mapping Genes Along Chromosomes\n3.1 Particulate Factors\u2014Mapping Genes Along Chromosomes\n\nMendelian research soon showed the independent assortment of factors\nin Mendel\u2019s experiments to be a special case, not a law.\nDepartures from independent assortment of traits allowed the\nidentification of linkage groups, in which variants of two or more\ntraits co-occur, which eventually were shown to correspond to the\nproximity of their place or locus on distinct chromosomes.\n(Indeed, Mendelian research helped expose properties of the\nchromosomes, such as their role in sex determination, and investigate\nmany other biological issues. Waters [2004] criticizes philosophers\nwho interpret Mendelism solely in terms of establishing a theory of\ninheritance: \u201cPosing and solving carefully orchestrated pedigree\nproblems was the means, not the ends, of classical genetics\u201d.)\nJohannsen\u2019s resistance to the idea that \u201cdiscrete\nparticles of the chromosomes are \u2018bearers\u2019 of special\nparts of the whole inheritance\u201d (1911: 131\u20132) was shared\nby others (Deichmann 2014), but such reservations did not hold back\nthe rise of Mendelianism to a dominant position in research into\nheredity well before the material make-up and functioning of those\nparticles\u2014the genes\u2014was revealed in the 1950s. The\nparticulate view was affirmed by producing heritable alterations in\nphenotypes after bombarding organisms with high-energy ionizing\nradiation. \n\nIt remained central to experiments involving crosses between lines\nthat, as much as possible, those lines were inbred and identical and\nhomozygous for genes influencing all traits apart from for the traits\nunder study. While the identical homozygous genes might have an\ninfluence on the development of any focal trait,\ndifferences in that trait could be attributed to\ndifferences in the genes that were not identical among the\ncrossed lines. (Indeed, by the 1930s heredity had come to refer to the\ntransmission of and cross-generational patterns in these differences,\nnot to the development of the similarities from which differences\ndepart [Sapp 1987].) Genotype could be applied to classes of\norganisms with a specific pair of genes (or small set of pairs)\nor to the specific pairs of genes themselves (matching the\nconnotation of type as an abstraction away from the full set of\nobserved characteristics). In Mendelian experiments\nphenotypes-as-classes demarcated by a small set of traits could be\nused to identify genotypes-as-classes. Then, once the genotype as\npair(s) of genes was mapped to a locus on the chromosome, the\ndirection could be reversed: the phenotype would then be the subset of\nan organism\u2019s traits associated with the genotype under given\nconditions (a forerunner here of the predominant current-day\nmeaning).\n",
