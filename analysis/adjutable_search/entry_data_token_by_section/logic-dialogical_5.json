    "main_text": "Variations on the Standard Dialogical Framework || Objections against the standard dialogical framework\n3.1 Objections against the standard dialogical framework\n\nThe standard dialogical framework is too formal. A\nrecurrent objection made to the standard dialogical framework is that\nit is too formal, in the sense that the dialogues in this\n\u201cdialogical\u201d logic are not real dialogues, with actual\ncontent, they only deal with the logical constants. See for instance\nHintikka (1973: 77\u201382), Peregrin (2014: 100, 106), Trafford\n(2017: 86\u201388), and Dutilh Novaes and French (2018: 131).\n\nAt least two options adopted provide an answer to this objection: one,\nwhich is not in the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition, consists in linking\ndialogues with empirical social interaction in line with argumentation\ntheory (Barth & Krabbe 1982; Gethmann 1979, for example); the\nother intends to stay in the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition and go all\nthe way with dialogues, which supposes providing content through\ndialogical means. The Immanent Reasoning framework\u2019s\nmaterial dialogues is a proposal to deal with this contentual\naspect, especially regarding elementary propositions. Such a project\nis consistent with the work of Lorenz (1970; 2009; 2010; 2011), which\ndeals with predication from a dialogical perspective, discussing the\ninteraction between perceptual and conceptual knowledge.\n\nMaterial dialogues have in fact been included in the dialogical\nframework from the start, as Krabbe (1985: 297) points out. Material\ndialogues indeed had priority over formal dialogues in Lorenzen and\nLorenz\u2019s work (Kamlah & Lorenzen 1967 [1972]; Lorenz 1961,\n1968). However, Krabbe further points out that the standard dialogical\nframework developed thereafter did not focus on the material\ndialogues; he interprets this fact as a sign that formal dialogues\nhad, after all, priority over material dialogues in the dialogical\nframework.\n\nThe reasons are not explicit in the standard dialogical\nframework. It may be objected to the standard dialogical\nframework that it claims to be a \u201cgame of giving and asking for\nreasons\u201d, but that these reasons are implicit. One way to answer\nthis challenge is proposed in the Immanent Reasoning framework which\nprovides \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cstrategic\u201d reasons to\nanswer this objection.\n\nThe standard dialogical framework is not completely\ndialogical. The original project of the dialogical framework\nwas to have language games that link meaning and use so tightly\ntogether that no extra theoretic construction would be required for\nthese games (Lorenz 1970: 109): syntax and meaning are dealt with at\nthe level of the language games, without necessitating any metalogical\napproach (which would deprive the signs from their meaning). But could\nthis project be carried out? The standard dialogical framework does\nnot require any metalogical reasoning at the level, say, of the\nparticle rules, but it does presuppose for example that the players\nuse well-formed formulas (wff) for statements. The well\nformation can be checked at will, but only with the usual meta\nreasoning by which one checks that the expression does indeed observe\nthe definition of a wff.\n\nSo can the dialogical framework be entirely based on language games,\nwithout any metalogical recourses? Or does it need at some point to\ncall on devices outside dialogues themselves? A typology of dialogical\napproaches to logic can be sketched according to their degree of\ndependency on non-dialogical frameworks:\n\ncomplete dependency (exits the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition):\ne.g., the Built-In Opponent conception of deduction, which depends on\nanother framework, usually Natural Deduction (Dutilh Novaes &\nFrench 2018; French 2021);\nlimited dependency: the standard dialogical framework, which\ndepends on metalogical considerations for checking that the statements\nare syntactically well formed;\nno dependency: the Immanent Reasoning framework, in which 1. the\nmeaning of the logical constants, 2. the syntactic formation of the\nstatements, and 3. the content of the elementary statements, are all\ntaken in charge through dialogues and their rules.\n\n",
