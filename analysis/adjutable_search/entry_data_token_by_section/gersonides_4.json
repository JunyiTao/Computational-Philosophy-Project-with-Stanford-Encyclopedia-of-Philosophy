Gersonides\u2019 Astrological Determinism\n\nEven a summary reading of Gersonides\u2019 major philosophical work\nevinces an explicit \u201cbelief in\u201d astrology. Gersonides\ndevelops his astral determinism in two contexts: in book II of\nWars he interweaves astrological motifs into his discussion\nof divine providence and prophecy, while in Book V astrology occupies\na central role in the context of his cosmological speculations. His\nmajor concern is the extent to which the stars and planets exerted an\ninfluence over human events in general, or more particularly, over\nthose actions that entail human choice. Judicial astrology was based\non the assumption that the entire world of nature was governed and\ndirected by the movement of the heavens and the celestial bodies, and\nthat man, as an animal naturally generated and living in the world of\nnature, was also naturally under their rule.\n\nLangermann emphasizes the teleological nature of astrology for\nGersonides, its chief merit being its ability to provide\n\u201cteleological explanations for the wide variety of stellar\nmotions that are observed to take place\u201d (Wars, Vol\nIII, p. 506). This teleology is reflected in V.2 ch 7\u20139 where,\nafter listing 27 problems raised by the heavenly bodies, Gersonides\nsuggests that only astrological considerations can furnish\nsatisfactory replies; it is astrology alone that can explain the\nconnection between the two realms. It is worth noting that on this\npoint, Gersonides disagrees with Maimonides over the ultimate purpose\nof the celestial bodies. For Maimonides it is not possible that a\ngreater entity, the heavens, would exist for the sake of the sublunar\nuniverse. Gersonides disagrees, maintaining that it is not\ninappropriate that the more noble exist for the less noble. The stars,\nhe argues, exist for the sake of things in the sublunar world\n(Wars, V.2.3, p. 194). More explicitly, the heavenly bodies\nare designed for the benefit of sublunar existence, and they guarantee\nthe perpetuation of life on earth.\n\nThis teleology is spelled out in Milhamot II, in which\nGersonides is concerned to explain how divine knowledge operates, and\nto what extent divine foreknowledge of future contingents affects\nhuman choice. His major thesis is that divine knowledge is predicated\nto a great extent upon knowledge of the heavenly bodies, which bodies\nare in turn \u201csystematically directed toward his [man\u2019s]\npreservation and guidance so that all his activities and thoughts are\nordered by them\u201d (Wars, II.2, p. 33). In support of\nthis teleological cosmology, Gersonides presents an extensive argument\nto the effect that the celestial bodies have a purpose. On the basis\nof this argument Gersonides concludes that from the perspective of the\nteleological structure of the universe, we can understand why the\nheavenly bodies behave the way they do. This teleology is reflected by\na \u201claw, order and rightness\u201d in the universe, implying the\nexistence of an intellect that orders the nature of things: \u201cyou\nsee that the domain of the spheres provides, in the best way possible,\nfor the sub-lunar world\u201d (Wars, V.2.5, p. 137).\n\nAs we have seen, the existence of a connection between celestial and\nterrestrial events was admitted by most everybody, but not everybody\nagreed on the nature of this connection. Gersonides as well must\naccount for the type of relation obtaining between celestial and\nterrestrial events. Having articulated the ordering power of the\nastral bodies, Gersonides describes in Milhamot V.3 the\nseparate intellects and the spheres that they move. The main\ncharacteristic of the astral bodies is their luminosity\n(nitzutz). This luminosity affects their actions and effects\n(Wars, V.2.3, p. 137). Gersonides is very much aware of the\nproblem of accounting for how the astral bodies can affect actions at\na distance. The sun, for example, functions as a paradigm for action\nat a distance. Once we understand, Gersonides claims, how the activity\nof heating reaches earth from the sun, we can understand how the\nparticular activities of the other stars reach the sublunar realm as\nwell. By explaining the efficient cause as the light or radiation of\nthe stars, Gersonides can account for weak or strong effects. As\nLangermann has pointed out, Gersonides\u2019 account furnishes the\nbasis for the introduction of astrological causation into natural\nphilosophy.\n\nIn Milhamot V.2.8 Gersonides lays out six astrological\nprinciples that affect his general cosmological scheme. These can be\nsummarized as follows. First, each astral body exercises a different\ninfluence specific to it. Second, astral influence depends upon its\nposition in the zodiac (galgal hamazalot). Third, the longer\na star stays in one place in the zodiac, the greater its effect\nbecause of the strength of its luminosity. Fourth, astral influence is\ndependent upon its inclination to the north or to the south; its\neffect will be strongest when it is in the middle, as evidenced by the\nsun, whose heat is strongest when it is at the Tropic of Cancer as\nopposed to being at the Tropic of Capricorn. Fifth, the greater the\nradiation or luminosity of a star, the stronger its influence. And\nfinally, the closer to earth a star is, the stronger will be its\ninfluence (Wars, V.2.8, p. 207\u20138). These principles\nfunction as the underpinnings of his general astronomy as well.\n\nIn light of the original problems posed by astrology above, let me\npropose that the most important piece of Levi\u2019s astrology is\nwhat Langermann calls the variety of the heavens (ribbui\nhayahasim). Gersonides must be able to account for individual\nvariety in the sublunar realm. Inasmuch as stellar radiation is the\nmeans by which stellar influences are conveyed, the wide variety of\nmixtures of stellar radiation guarantees a sufficient variety of\n\u201cinfluences\u201d on terrestrial processes. The movers emanate\nfrom God who is construed as the \u201cFirst Separate\nIntellect\u201d (Wars, V.3.8, p. 272). They are ordered in a\nrational system that governs the sublunar domain. If there were no one\nfirst intellect, Gersonides argues, the rational order we see in the\nheavens would be the result of chance, which is unacceptable. The\nagent intellect thus functions as the link between these celestial\nbodies and human affairs. The kinds of information it transmits are of\nan astronomical type, as evidenced in the following example: \u201cit\n[the agent intellect] knows how many revolutions of the sun, or of the\ndiurnal sphere, or of any other sphere [have transpired] from the time\nat which someone, who falls under a particular pattern, had a\nparticular level of good or ill fortune\u2026\u201d (Wars,\nII.6, p. 64). The agent intellect serves as the repository of\ninformation communicated by the heavenly bodies. The patterns revealed\nin this communication between agent intellect and diviner (astrologer,\nprophet) are from the heavenly bodies which themselves are endowed\nwith intellects and so \u201capprehend the pattern that derives from\nthem.\u201d Each mover apprehends the order deriving from the\nheavenly body it moves, and not patterns that emanate from other\nheavenly bodies. As a result, the imaginative faculty receives the\n\u201cpattern inherent in the intellects of the heavenly bodies from\nthe influence deriving from them.\u201d This influence derives from\nthe position of the heavenly bodies \u201cby the ascendent degree or\nthe dominant planet [in a particular zodiacal position]\u201d\n(Wars, II.6, p. 64). However, inasmuch as the heavenly bodies\ndo not jointly cooperate with one another (lo yishtatfu) in\nthis process, it is possible for the communication to be\nmisconstrued.\n\nOf course, as we all know, astrologers often err in their predictions.\nAstrological errors can be due to several factors. In general,\nGersonides claims, we know very little of the order of the heavenly\nbodies. \u201cIn general, it is impossible for man to know the\n[complete] truth of the order of the sublunar world. This is nicely\nillustrated in astrology, where frequently false predictions are made.\nAll the more so is it impossible for man to know the general order of\nthe sublunar world by means of its causes so that his knowledge would\nbe perfect\u201d (Wars, I.12, p. 219). In some cases, the\ninformation is not transmitted clearly. Why is it that certain\ncommunications are received more clearly than others? A\nconstitutionally perfect imaginative faculty receives information from\nboth dominant and weak heavenly bodies. By \u2018weak\u2019,\nGersonides means that certain celestial bodies are too weak both to\nbring about events on earth as well as to transmit information about\nthese events. Hence he concludes that information about the future\nemanates \u201cfrom the dominant body in the particular proper face\n(panim) in which it has dominance but not from any of the\nattending planets (ha-meshartim)\u201d (Wars, II.7,\npp. 69\u201370). But to constitutionally imperfect imaginative\nfaculties, the information received is only from the dominant heavenly\nbodies. Hence the overall quality of the information received will\ndiffer in the two cases. More specifically, because of the difficulty\nof obtaining the necessary positions of these bodies by observation,\nastrologers are often unable to verify their data. Furthermore, since\nthe zodiacal position of a heavenly body at any given time is only\nrepeated once in many thousands of years, astrologers have no access\nto the repeatability of those events that would be required to verify\ntheir knowledge. Furthermore, humans simply do not have sufficient\nknowledge about the heavenly bodies.\n\nThe final cause for error has to do with human free will: as we have\nseen above, our intellect and choice \u201chave the power to move us\ncontrary to that which is determined by the heavenly bodies\u201d\n(Wars, II.2, p. 34). Although he admits that on occasion\nhuman choice is able to contravene the celestial bodies, nevertheless\nthis intervention is rare, and true contingency is a rare state of\naffairs indeed in Gersonides\u2019 ontology. Gersonides presents an\nargument to show that human choice guided by reason can subvert the\ncelestial bodies despite their general ordering of our lives. The\nheavenly bodies can order human affairs either by virtue of their\ndifference of position in the heavens, or from the difference of the\nbodies among themselves. Astral bodies, however, will affect different\nindividuals in different ways; they can also affect an individual\ndifferently at different times; and finally, two or more bodies can\naffect a single individual, resulting in multiple influences that can\nhave contrary effects, echoing the scholastic phrase,\n\u201csapiens dominabitur astris [the wise man will be ruled\nby the stars]\u201d. Gersonides notes that humans can contravene\nthese effects: God has provided humans with \u201cthe intellectual\ncapacity (sekhel ba\u2019al takhlit) that enables us both to\nact contrary to what has been ordered by the heavenly bodies and to\ncorrect, as far as possible, the [astrally ordained] misfortunes that\nbefall us\u201d (Wars, II.2, p. 35). Nevertheless, he\nassures us that whatever happens by chance is \u201cdetermined and\nordered according to this type of determinateness and order\u201d\n(Wars, II.2, p. 34). Outdoing even Plato\u2019s hierarchical\nstructuring in Republic IV, Gersonides argues that the\nultimate perfection and ordering of society is due to astrological\ninfluence.\n\nThe commensurability of the motion of heavenly bodies raises an\nadditional concern, having to do with the uniqueness of individual\nbeings and the doctrine of eternal return. Gersonides\u2019 immediate\n13th century predecessors Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera and Judah\nben Solomon ha-Cohen discussed this issue against the backdrop of\nAristotle\u2019s Gen. Animalia. In Gen. Animalia,\nAristotle had established a connection between the life spans and\ngestations periods of animals and the revolutions of the sun and moon\n(Gen. Anim., IV.10, 777b17\u2013778a10). Thus the\nrevolutions of the sun measure not only time but also produce the\nalternating periods of growth and decay. Eschatological predictions\nare thus tied to the cyclicity of the heavenly bodies. Gersonides did\nnot [to our knowledge] indulge in eschatological and millennial\npredictions. In fact, Gersonides wrote only one astrological text that\nhas survived, a prognostication based on the conjunction of Saturn and\nJupiter to take place in March 1345. Gersonides himself died in 1344,\na year before the event in question. As Goldstein has demonstrated,\nthis conjunction was predicted already by Ibn Ezra, and repeated by\nAbraham Bar Hiyya in his Megillat ha-Megalleh where the\nconjunction was associated with a date of messianic significance that\nwould supposedly take effect in 1358 (Goldstein 1990, p. 3). The\nconjunction was codified by Levi ben Abraham ben Hayyim in his\nencyclopedia Livyat Hen, indicating an awareness in the\nJewish community of the messianic significance of this conjunction.\nAccording to North, Ibn Ezra was the earliest scholar to record one of\nthe seven methods for the setting up of the astrological houses;\nGersonides then computed the astrological houses for the\nprognostication of 1345 according to Ibn Ezra\u2019s method. (See\nNorth 1986, p. 25.) Goldstein suggests that as the date 1345\napproached, the Papal court might have become interested as well in\nthe conjunction. We do know that Gersonides\u2019 text was translated\ninto Latin with the aid of his brother shortly after Gersonides\u2019\ndeath in 1344.\n\nIn his prognostication, Gersonides predicts that there will be\n\u201cextraordinary evil with many wars, visions and miraculous\nsigns;\u201d \u201cDiseases and death, and the evil will endure for\na long time;\u201d \u201cthe absence of good, pleasure and happiness\nfor most of the inhabited world;\u201d \u201cthe spilling of much\nblood and increasing enmity, jealousy, strife, famine, various\ndiseases, drought and dearth\u201d (Goldstein 1990). The Black\nDeath, which arrived in Europe in 1347, was thus provided with\nnumerous astrological credentials. The official statement of the\nmedical faculty of the University of Paris, presented to the king in\n1348, reported on the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in the house\nof Aquarius on 20 March 1345, which was seen to spread \u201cdeath\nand disaster\u201d. It is not hard to see how the conjunction of 1345\ncame to be associated with the Black Death.\n",
