    "main_text": "Nozick\u2019s Life and Times\n1. Nozick\u2019s Life and Times\n\nRobert Nozick was born in Brooklyn in 1938 to a Russian Jewish\nimmigrant family. He earned an undergraduate Philosophy degree from\nColumbia University in 1959 and a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Princeton\nUniversity in 1963. He taught for a couple of years at Princeton,\nHarvard, and Rockefeller Universities before moving permanently to\nHarvard in 1969. He became widely known through his 1974 book,\nAnarchy, State, and Utopia, which shocked the philosophical\nworld with its robust and sophisticated defense of the minimal\nstate\u2014the state that restricts its activities to the protection\nof individual rights of life, liberty, property, and contract and\neschews the use of state power to redistribute income, to make people\nmoral, or to protect people from harming themselves. Nozick went on to\npublish important works that ranged over metaphysics, epistemology,\nthe philosophy of science, and axiology\u2014Philosophical\nExplanations (1981), The Examined Life (1989), The\nNature of Rationality (1993), Socratic Puzzles (1997),\nand Invariances (2001). Nozick\u2019s always lively,\nengaging, audacious, and philosophically ambitious writings revealed\nan amazing knowledge of advanced work in many disciplines including\ndecision theory, economics, mathematics, physics, psychology, and\nreligion. Robert Nozick died in 2002 from stomach cancer for which he\nwas first treated in 1994.\n\nAs an undergraduate student at Columbia and at least in his early days\nas a graduate student at Princeton, Nozick endorsed socialism. At\nColumbia, he was a founder of what was to become the local chapter of\nStudents for a Democratic Society. The major force in his conversion\nto libertarian views was his conversations at Princeton with his\nfellow philosophy graduate student, Bruce Goldberg. It was through\nGoldberg that Nozick met the economist Murray Rothbard who was the\nmajor champion of \u201cindividualist anarchism\u201d in the later\ndecades of the twentieth century (Raico 2002, Other Internet\nResources). Nozick\u2019s encounter with Rothbard and\nRothbard\u2019s rights-based critique of the state (Rothbard 1973 and\n1978)\u2014including the minimal state\u2014lead Nozick to the\nproject of formulating a rights-based libertarianism that would\nvindicate the minimal state. There is, however, an intriguing lacuna\nin this story. Goldberg himself and the economists whose writings are\noften said to have influenced Nozick\u2019s conversion to\nlibertarianism\u2014F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman\u2014were not at\nall friends of natural rights theory. So, we have no account of why\nthe libertarianism that Nozick himself adopted came in the form of\nnatural rights theory (and an associated doctrine of acquired property\nrights).\n\nThis account of the political philosophy of Robert Nozick is\nfundamentally an account of the rights-oriented libertarian doctrine\nthat Nozick presents in Anarchy, State, and Utopia. That\ndoctrine is the Nozickean\n doctrine.[2]\n Nozick never attempted to further develop the views that he expressed\nin\n ASU,[3]\n and he never responded to the extensive critical reaction to those\nviews. Nozick did seem to repudiate at least some aspects of the\nASU doctrine in The Examined Life and The Nature\nof Rationality (Nozick 1989: 286\u2013296). Nozick\u2019s real\nor apparent repudiation in these works turned on his doctrine of\nsymbolic utility which cannot be examined\n here.[4]\n At later yet points in his life Nozick downplayed his apparent\nrepudiation of political\n libertarianism.[5]\n In a 2001 interview, he said:\n\n\n\u2026 the rumors of my deviation (or apostasy!) from libertarianism\nwere much exaggerated. I think [Invariances] makes clear the\nextent to which I still am within the general framework of\nlibertarianism, especially the ethics chapter and its section on the\n\u201cCore Principle of Ethics\u201d. (Sanchez 2001, Other Internet\nResources)\n\n\nAccording to that chapter, there are a number of layers of ethics. The\nfirst of these is the ethics of respect which consists of a set of\nnegative rights. This layer and only this layer may be made mandatory\nin any society. \u201cAll that any society should (coercively) demand\nis adherence to the ethics of respect\u201d (Nozick 2001: 282).\n\nThere are four main topics that most deserve discussion with respect\nto Anarchy, State, and Utopia. They are: (1) the underpinning\n(if any) and the character and robustness of the moral rights that\nconstitute the basic normative framework for most of Anarchy,\nState, and Utopia; (2) the character and degree of success of\nNozick\u2019s defense of the minimal state against the charge by the\nindividualist anarchist that \u201cthe state itself is intrinsically\nimmoral\u201d (ASU 51); (3) Nozick\u2019s articulation and\ndefense of his historical entitlement doctrine of justice in holdings\nand his associated critique of end-state and patterned doctrines of\ndistributive justice, especially John Rawls\u2019 difference\nprinciple (as defended in A Theory of Justice); and (4)\nNozick\u2019s argument that utopian aspirations provide a\ncomplementary route to the vindication of the minimal state. Our\ndiscussion of the first two topics focuses on Part I of ASU,\nentitled \u201cState-of-Nature Theory or How to Back into a State\nwithout Really Trying\u201d. Our investigation of the third topic,\nthe historical entitlement doctrine of just holdings and competing\nconceptions of distributive justice, focuses on chapter 7,\n\u201cDistributive Justice\u201d of Part II of ASU,\n\u201cBeyond the Minimal State?\u201d Our discussion of the fourth\ntopic, the utopian route to the minimal state, focuses on chapter 10,\n\u201cA Framework for Utopia\u201d, which is the whole of Part III\nof ASU, \u201cUtopia\u201d. Focusing on these four core\ntopics leaves aside many of Nozick\u2019s rich and intriguing side\ndiscussions.\n",
