    "main_text": "Friendship, Politics, and Environmentalism\n4. Friendship, Politics, and Environmentalism\n\nThoreau\u2019s ethic of personal flourishing is focused upon the\nproblem of how to align one\u2019s daily life in accordance with\none\u2019s ultimate ideals. What was enthusiasm in the youth, he\nargues, must become temperament in the mature person: the \u201cmere\nvision is little compared with the steady corresponding endeavor\nthitherward\u201d (Journal, 11/1/51 & 11/24/57). Much of\nour time ought to be spent \u201cin carrying out deliberately and\nfaithfully the hundred little purposes which every man\u2019s genius\nmust have suggested to him\u2026 . The wisely conscious life springs\nout of an unconscious suggestion\u201d (Wild Fruits, 166).\nCharacter, then, can be defined as \u201cgenius\nsettled\u201d\u2014the promptings of conscience in themselves are\nonly potentially moral, until we have integrated them into\nthe fabric of our everyday existence and begun to hold ourselves\nresponsible for living up to them (Journal, 3/2/42). Hence,\nwe need to cherish and nurture our capability to discern the\ndifference between the idea and the reality, between what is\nand what ought to be. It is when we experience\ndissatisfaction with ourselves or with external circumstances that we\nare stimulated to act in the interest of making things better.\n\nIt follows that the greatest compliment we can pay to another person\nis to say that he or she enhances our life by inciting us to realize\nour highest aspirations. So Thoreau views it as deplorable that\n\u201cwe may love and not elevate one another\u201d; the \u201clove\nthat takes us as it finds us, degrades us\u201d (\u201cChastity and\nSensuality\u201d). He speaks of \u201clove\u201d and\n\u201cfriendship\u201d as closely related terms which are tainted by\nthe \u201ctrivial dualism\u201d which assumes that the one must\nexclude the other (Journal, undated 1839 entry). Clearly,\nwhat he is concerned about is the kind of love the Greeks called\nphilia\u2014and in his sustained consideration of\nfriendship, as in so many other respects, Thoreau is \u201csquarely\nin the virtue ethics tradition\u201d (Cafaro 2004, 127). In his\nethical writings, the notion of wishing good on behalf of another\nperson is often taken to a severe extreme, as if he does not think it\npossible to ask too much of love and friendship. In A Week on the\nConcord and Merrimack Rivers, he says: \u201cI value and trust\nthose who love and praise my aspiration rather than my\nperformance\u201d (A Week, \u201cWednesday\u201d). This is\nwell and good, but Thoreau may be going too far when he proclaims that\na friend should be approached \u201cwith sacred love and awe,\u201d\nand that we profane one another if we do not always meet on religious\nterms; it is no wonder that he finds himself doubting whether his\n\u201cidea of a friend\u201d will ever actually be instantiated\n(Journal, 6/26/40). Nonetheless, as a recent interpreter of\nThoreau has pointed out, the \u201cexalted and rarefied ideal\u201d\nof friendship that he upholds does not imply that a friend is merely\ninstrumental to one\u2019s own self-realization (see Hodder 2010,\n129\u2013142). Above all, Thoreau\u2019s discussion of love and\nfriendship provokes us to reflect upon what we can and cannot expect\nfrom our closest human relationships, and on their role in a good\nlife.\n\nIt would be a mistake to consider Thoreau\u2019s political views in\nisolation from other aspects of his thought. It is, for example, his\nunderstanding of wild nature that informs his sociopolitical ideas. As\nwas noted above, nature is a point of reference outside the\npolis which can provide valuable moral guidance, reminding us\nthat society is not the measure of all things. Considering the human\nbeing as \u201can inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature,\u201d\nrather than a cultural artifact merely (\u201cWalking\u201d), he\nlooks to the nonhuman natural world and to our inherent\n\u201cwildness\u201d as a source of evaluation which can empower us\nto discover that the standards of our civilization are profoundly\nflawed. His conviction that nature provides us with \u201ca\ndifferent, truer, and more significant moral reality\u201d than what\nwe find in society provides the \u201ccrucial and often overlooked\npolitical core\u201d to what has been called his \u201cpastoral\nenvironmentalism\u201d (Taylor 1992, 12\u201324). Withdrawing into the\nnatural world allows us to view the state in a broader context and to\nconceive of ways in which social values and political structures could\nbe improved radically. This includes unjust laws that ought to be\nreformed, about which more will be said in a moment, as well as the\nunwritten rules embodied in prevailing expectations about how one\nought to live and what matters. Anticipating Heidegger\u2019s\ncritique of Das Man in section 27 of Being and Time,\nThoreau describes the source of these culturally prevalent attitudes\nas the \u201cThey\u201d (Walden, I; see also Bennett 1994,\n18\u201319) and is critical of their pervasive and corrupting influence,\ntheir way of making people content with distorted values. For\ninstance, most of his fellow citizens of Massachusetts are able to\ngreet each other politely on the street and in church, thinking of\nthemselves as morally decent while remaining complacent to uphold and\nperpetuate the institution of slavery in America (see \u201cSlavery\nin Massachusetts\u201d and \u201cA Plea for Captain John\nBrown\u201d). In denouncing a specific pernicious attitude that is\nwidespread among his contemporaries, Thoreau also seeks to identify\nand analyze the general tendency it exemplifies to defer to public\nopinion: for this reason, his project of social critique is not only\nrelevant to his parochial context but has universal implications. He\nis acutely conscious of the threat that shared modes of discourse can\npose to justice and authentic intersubjectivity.\n\nThoreau is only half-joking when he tells us that, after becoming\nfrustrated with society, he turned \u201cmore exclusively than ever\nto the woods, where I was better known\u201d (Walden, I).\nNot only is it true that a degree of solitude and distance from our\nneighbors may actually improve our relations with them, but by moving\naway from the center of town we liberate ourselves from a slavish\nadherence to prevailing attitudes. \u201cThe greater part of what my\nneighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad,\u201d he claims,\nproviding this kind of example: \u201cIf a man walk in the woods for\nlove of them half of each day, he is in danger of being regarded as a\nloafer; but if he spends his whole day as a speculator, shearing off\nthose woods and making earth bald before her time, he is esteemed an\nindustrious and enterprising citizen\u201d (Walden, I and\n\u201cLife Without Principle\u201d). This warped sense of value is\nall too common amidst the desperation of modern life, with its\n\u201crestless, nervous, bustling, trivial\u201d activity\n(Walden, XVIII). Thoreau builds a critique of American\nculture upon his conviction that \u201cthe mind can be permanently\nprofaned by the habit of attending to trivial things, so that all our\nthoughts shall be tinged with triviality\u201d (\u201cLife Without\nPrinciple\u201d): his polemic aims at consumerism, philistinism, mass\nentertainment, vacuous applications of technology, and the herd\nmentality that conforms to the dictates of an anonymous\n\u201cThey.\u201d During his life Thoreau spoke out against the\nMexican War and the subjugation of Native America, and campaigned\naggressively in favor of bioregionalism and the protection of animals\nand the natural environment. It is outrageous that he is often\nstereotyped as a recluse and hermit. Above all, the political issue\nthat aroused his indignation was slavery. Because Thoreau understood\nphilosophy as a way of life, it is only fitting that philosophical\nideals would lead him into political action.\n\nHe was an activist involved in the abolitionist movement on many\nfronts: he participated in the Underground Railroad, protested against\nthe Fugitive Slave Law, and gave support to John Brown and his party.\nMost importantly perhaps, he provides a justification for principled\nrevolt and a method of nonviolent resistance, both of which would have\na considerable influence on revolutionary movements in the twentieth\ncentury. In his essay on \u201cCivil Disobedience,\u201d originally\npublished as \u201cResistance to Civil Government,\u201d Thoreau\ndefends the validity of conscientious objection to unjust laws, which\nhe claims ought to be transgressed at once. Political institutions as\nsuch are regarded by him with distrust, and although he arguably\noverestimates the extent to which it is possible to disassociate\noneself from them, he convincingly insists that social consensus is\nnot a guarantee of rectitude or truth. One of the most valuable points\nhe makes against the critics of John Brown is that a person should not\nbe dismissed as \u201cinsane\u201d by virtue of dissenting from the\nmajority: Brown\u2019s anger is grounded upon an awareness of the\nfact that slavery is a violation of human rights, and Thoreau berates\nthe law-abiding citizens of Massachusetts for looking the other way\n(\u201cA Plea for Captain John Brown\u201d). Passively and quietly\nallowing an unjust practice to continue is tantamount to collaborating\nwith evil, he claims, articulating a principle of noncompliance that\nwould inspire the philosophically informed nonviolent resistance of\nMahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, among others.\n\nWhen Thoreau argues that all of Brown\u2019s actions were justified\nbecause he was an inspired reformer with a sacred vocation,\nhe is appealing to something like the notion of natural right. His\nessay in this respect has a more general pertinence to debates about\nthe individual moral reformer in relation to community norms. It also\nraises the issue of whether political violence can be justified as the\nlesser of evils, or in cases where it may be the only available way of\nending injustice. Usually, he prefers nonviolent forms of advocacy\nsuch as creating \u201ccounter friction to stop the machine\u201d by\nopposing, and acting in defiance of, practices and laws that are not\nrighteous (\u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d). Speaking about the act\nof protest that led him to spend a night in jail, he expresses\ncharacteristic irony by saying that \u201cI might have resisted\nforcibly with more or less effect, might have run amok against\nsociety; but I preferred that society should run amok against me, it\nbeing the desperate party\u201d (Walden, VIII). Although at\ntimes it sounds as though Thoreau is advocating anarchy, what he\ndemands is a better government, and what he refuses to\nacknowledge is the authority of one that has become so morally corrupt\nas to lose the consent of those governed. \u201cThere will never be a\nreally free and enlightened State, \u201d he argues, \u201cuntil the\nState comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent\npower, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and\ntreats him accordingly\u201d (\u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d).\nThere are simply more sacred laws to obey than the laws of society,\nand a just government\u2014should there ever be such a thing, he\nadds\u2014would not be in conflict with the conscience of the\nethically upright individual.\n",
