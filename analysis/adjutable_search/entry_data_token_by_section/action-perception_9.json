    "main_text": "Motor Component and Efferent Readiness Theories || The Motor Component Theory (Embodied Visual Perception)\n3.1 The Motor Component Theory (Embodied Visual Perception)\n\nAs pointed out in\n Section 2.3.2,\n there are numerous, independently variable sources of information\nabout the spatial layout of the environment in the light sampled by\nthe eye. In many cases, however, processing of stimulus information\nrequires or is optimized by recruiting sources of auxiliary\ninformation from outside the visual system. These may be directly\nintegrated with incoming visual information or used to change the\nweighting assigned to one or another source of optical stimulus\ninformation (Shams & Kim 2010; Ernst 2012).\n\nAn importantly different recruitment strategy involves combining\nvisual input with non-perceptual information originating in the\nbody\u2019s motor control systems, in particular, efference copy,\nand/or proprioceptive feedback from active movement (kinaesthesis).\nThe motor component theory, as we shall call it, is\npremised on evidence for such motor-modal processing.\n\nThe motor component theory can be made more concrete by examining\nthree situations in which the spatial contents of visual experience\nare modulated by information concerning recently initiated or\nimpending bodily movements:\n\nApparent direction: The retinal image produced by\nan object is ambiguous with respect to the object\u2019s direction in\nthe absence of extraretinal information concerning the orientation of\nthe eye relative to the head. While there is evidence that\nproprioceptive inflow from muscle spindles in the extraocular muscles\nis used to encode eye position, as Sherrington 1918 proposed,\noutflowing efference copy is generally regarded as the more\nheavily weighted source of information (Bridgeman & Stark 1991).\nThe problem of visual direction constancy was discussed in detail in\n Section 2.1\n above.\nApparent distance and size: When an object is at\nclose range, its distance in depth from the perceiver can be\ndetermined on the basis of three variables: (1) the distance between\nthe perceiver\u2019s eyes, (2) the vergence angle formed by the line\nof sight from each eye to the object, and (3) the direction of gaze.\nInformation about (1) is updated in the course of development as the\nperceiver\u2019s body grows. Information about (2) and (3), which\nvary from one moment to the next, is obtained from efference copy of\nthe motor command to fixate the object as well as proprioceptive\nfeedback from the extraocular muscles. Since an object\u2019s\napparent size is a function of its perceived distance from the\nperceiver and the angle it subtends on the retina (Emmert 1881),\ninformation about (2) and (3) can thus modulate visual size perception\n(Mon-Williams et al. 1997).\nApparent motion: In the most familiar case of\nmotion perception, the subject visually tracks a moving target, e.g.,\na bird in flight, against a stable background using smooth\npursuit eye movements. As Bridgeman et al. 1994 note,\nsmooth pursuit \u201creverses the movement conditions on the retina:\nthe tracked object sweeps across the retina very little, while the\nbackground undergoes a brisk motion\u201d (p. 255). Nonetheless, it\nis the target that appears to be in motion while the environment\nappears to be stationary. There is evidence that the visual system is\nable to compensate for pursuit induced retinal motion by means of\nefference-based information about the changing direction of gaze (for\na review, see Furman & Gur 2012). This has been used to explain\nthe travelling moon illusion (Post & Leibowitz 1985: 637).\nNeuropsychological findings indicate that failure to integrate\nefference-based information about eye movement leads to a breakdown in\nperceived background stability during smooth pursuit (Haarmeier et\nal. 1997; Nakamura & Colby 2002; Fischer et al.\n2012).\n\n\nThe motor component theory is a version of the view that perception is\nembodied in the sense of Prinz 2009 (see the entry on\n embodied cognition).\n Prinz explains that\n\n\nembodied mental capacities, are ones that depend on mental\nrepresentations or processes that relate to the body\u2026. Such\nrepresentations and processes come in two forms: there are\nrepresentations and processes that represent or respond to body, such\nas a perception of bodily movement, and there are representations and\nprocesses that affect the body, such as motor commands (2009:\n420).\n\n\nThe three examples presented above provide empirical support for the\nthesis that visual perception is embodied in this sense. For\nadditional examples, see Ebenholtz 2002: chap. 4, and for further\ndiscussion of various senses of embodiment, see Alsmith & de\nVignemount 2012, de Vignemont & Alsmith 2017, Bermu\u0301dez 2018,\nStoneham 2018, and Berendzen 2023.\n",
