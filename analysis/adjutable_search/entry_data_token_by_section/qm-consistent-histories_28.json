    "main_text": "Paradoxes Resolved || Incompatibility paradoxes\n10.3 Incompatibility paradoxes\nThe Bell-Kochen-Specker family of\nparadoxes (Bell 1966; Kochen & Specker\n1967) are based on a relatively simple idea, although its\nexecution is sometimes complicated: if one chains together a\nsufficient number of incompatible frameworks it is possible to arrive\nat a logical contradiction. The chaining consists in finding a\nprojector which belongs to two (or more) incompatible decompositions\nof the identity, and then assuming it has the same truth value in both\nframeworks, whereas in any single decomposition one and only one\nprojector is true. The histories approach blocks paradoxes of this\nsort because they (obviously) violate the single framework rule. See\nthe Further Reading supplement for details.\n\n\nThe three-box paradox of Aharonov &\nVaidman (1991) is similar to Bell-Kochen-Specker, except that\nin this case quantum dynamics is involved, and the issue has to do\nwith incommensurate families of histories (combining them violates the\nconsistency conditions) rather than incompatible sample spaces. Again,\nthe histories resolution of the paradox, Sec. 22.5\nof Griffiths (2002a), consists in\napplying the single framework rule: a contradiction can only be\nreached by violating quantum rules of reasoning.\n",
