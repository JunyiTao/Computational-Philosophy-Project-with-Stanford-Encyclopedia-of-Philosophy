    "main_text": "The Debate About the Comprehensiveness of Liberalism || Political Liberalism\n3.1 Political Liberalism\n\nAs his work evolved, Rawls (1996: 5ff) insisted that his liberalism\nwas not a \u2018comprehensive\u2019 doctrine, that is, one which\nincludes an overall theory of value, an ethical theory, an\nepistemology, or a controversial metaphysics of the person and\nsociety. Our modern societies, characterized by a \u2018reasonable\npluralism\u2019, are already filled with such doctrines. The aim of\npolitical liberalism is not to add yet another sectarian doctrine, but\nto provide a political framework that is neutral between such\ncontroversial comprehensive doctrines (Larmore, 1996: 121ff).\nRawls\u2019s notion of a purely political conception of liberalism\nseems more austere than the traditional liberal political theories\ndiscussed above, being largely restricted to constitutional principles\nupholding basic civil liberties and the democratic process.\n\nGaus (2004) argues that the distinction between\n\u2018political\u2019 and \u2018comprehensive\u2019 liberalism\nmisses a great deal. Liberal theories form a broad continuum, from\nthose that constitute full-blown philosophical systems, to those that\nrely on a full theory of value and the good, to those that rely on a\ntheory of the right (but not the good), all the way to those that seek\nto be purely political doctrines. Nevertheless, it is important to\nappreciate that, though we treat liberalism as primarily a political\ntheory, it has been associated with broader theories of ethics, value,\nand society. Indeed, many believe that liberalism cannot rid itself of\nall controversial metaphysical (Hampton, 1989) or epistemological\n(Raz, 1990) commitments.\n",
