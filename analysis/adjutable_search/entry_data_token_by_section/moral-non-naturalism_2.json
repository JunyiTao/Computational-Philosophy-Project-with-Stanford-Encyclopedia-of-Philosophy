    "main_text": "Intuitionism\n3. Intuitionism\n\n\nHow can we come to know anything about non-natural properties? The\nquestion is a reasonable one on any of the myriad ways in which\nnon-natural properties have been conceived. On many characterizations,\nnon-natural properties by definition elude scientific investigation\nwhich many take to be the most reliable form of knowledge available to\nus. On other characterizations, non-natural properties are causally\ninert which makes it hard to see how we could reliably detect them.\n\n\nAt least two kinds of questions are relevant here. First, once we\nhave a particular property in mind how can we know it is a moral one?\nSecond, how do we come to know anything about moral properties apart\nfrom knowing they are moral? The first question might seem more\ndifficult for the naturalist than for some non-naturalists; if goodness\nreally is a sui generis non-natural property then perhaps\nbeing directly acquainted with it is sufficient for recognizing it as\nmoral. The second question, though, is easier for the naturalist than\nthe non-naturalist. Since the naturalist holds that moral properties\nare either identical to or reducible to some subset of natural\nproperties there need be no mystery about how we come to have some\nknowledge of those properties even if there is some residual mystery as\nto how we discover that they are the moral ones. Or, at least, a\ncommitment to naturalism in meta-ethics introduces no new problems\nabout how we come to know anything about these properties. For given\nnaturalism, the moral properties might well be identical to or\nreducible to familiar properties like the property of promoting\nhappiness or the property of being truthful. In general we learn about\nsuch natural properties through observation and scientific inquiry and\nthe naturalist can \u201cpiggy back\u201d on whatever more general\nepistemological theory explains our ability to come to know anything\nabout those properties. We learn, for example, what kinds of upbringing\npromote honesty through empirical observation and theorizing.\nNon-naturalism can be understood in many different ways, but none seems\nto make the task of explaining the possibility of moral knowledge as\nstraightforward as it seems to be for the naturalist.\n\n\nThe non-naturalist\u2019s standard move here is to defend some form of\n\u201cintuitionism.\u201d In its most straightforward form, intuitionism holds\nthat we come to know about moral properties through direct observation\nof those properties. Just as we can learn that cat is on the mat\nthrough direct observation we can also learn that kicking the cat on\nthe mat is wrong through direct observation. If we have the appropriate\nmoral sensibilities and just look carefully enough at a given situation\nthen we should be able to discern the relevant moral properties as such\nquite directly. It is worth noting that this move is in principle\navailable to naturalists as well as non-naturalists. In some cases this\nwill be easy; if you watch a bully beat up a defenseless child for fun\nthen it should be easy enough to see the cruelty and wrongness of his\naction. In other cases, discerning the moral facts will be much more\ndifficult. However, the difficulty of such cases is compatible with\nintuitionism. Familiarity with aesthetes makes it clear that perceiving\ncertain properties can be very subtle and require considerable training\nand attention. Plausibly, an intuitionist epistemology fits better\nwith some versions of non-naturalism than others. If, for example, we\nunderstand non-natural properties as properties we can know only a\npriori then the idea that we come to know them through perception seems\nproblematic. In any event, if intuitionism is defensible then it\nprovides the non-naturalist with an answer to both of the questions\nraised above. Plausibly, if we directly perceive moral properties (at\nleast partly answering the second question) then we also directly\nperceive that they are moral (answering the first question).\n\n\nSometimes the intuitionist\u2019s perceptual characterization of moral\nknowledge is metaphorical. The idea is that moral knowledge is not\nliterally perceptual in the first instance but is somehow very much\nlike perceptual knowledge. This approach has its advantages. In trying\nto make sense of the idea of moral perception of non-natural\nproperties, some intuitionists have maintained that our ability to have\nveridical experiences of the moral properties is in virtue of our\nhaving a special faculty of mind whose function is to detect such\nproperties. This raises a number of questions about the origin and\nfunctioning of such a faculty. An account that claims only that moral\nknowledge is somehow like perceptual knowledge need not face these\ndifficulties. Of course, such accounts run the risk of being too vague\nto be helpful unless some less metaphorical account of moral knowledge\nis forthcoming. Even those who take the idea or perceptual moral\nknowledge literally are not thereby committed to belief in such special\nfaculties. Perhaps moral perception is continuous with other ordinary\nforms of perception even if it is literally the perception of a\nnon-natural property. If non-natural properties are by definition\ncausally inert then this position seems problematic. On other ways of\nunderstanding non-natural properties, though, whether there is a\nproblem will depend on further controversial philosophical questions.\nFor example, if non-natural properties are understood as properties\nthat would not figure in the best scientific account of reality then\nthe issue obviously concerns the authority of science to determine the\nanswers to all ontological questions. Non-naturalists sometimes accuse\ntheir opponents of crude scientism for assuming that science has such\nauthority and this brings out some deeper methodological differences\nbetween naturalists and non-naturalists (see below, \u201cMethodology\u201d).\n One interesting objection to the non-naturalist\u2019s deployment of\nintuitionism is that this combination of views makes it a\n\u201ccosmic coincidence\u201d that our intuitions would reliably\ntrack the moral facts (see Bedke 2009).  The force of the worry\nderives from the fact that non-natural properties, on some construals,\nare causally inert, whereas our intuitions are psychological states\nand hence part of the natural world.  It is simply not clear how our\nintuitions could reliably track such facts, given that they are\ncausally isolated from them.  An obvious contrast is with the way in\nwhich our knowledge of the empirical world plausibly does depend on\nreliability secured through suitable causal connections.  This is\nobviously related to other worries about the way in which the origins\nof our moral intuitions does not cohere well with their reliability,\ngiven non-naturalism \u2013 e.g. worries which focus more on the Darwinian\ninfluences on human moral judgment (see also Street 2006; for a reply\nto such worries, see Vavova forthcoming).  Interestingly, some\nnon-naturalists have tried to give a Darwinian argument for a kind of\nnon-theological pre-established harmony between our moral intuitions\nand the moral facts (see especially Enoch 2011).\n An even more fundamental worry arising out of the causal inertness\nof moral properties, given non-naturalism, is how our words and\nconcepts manage so much as to be about those properties.  Certainly on\na causal theory of reference it would be very hard indeed to explain\nhow our moral words and concepts could refer to such sui generis moral\nproperties.  This worry about what is sometimes called \u201csemantic\naccess\u201d has only recently started to get the attention it\ndeserves \u2013 see Wedgwood 2009 and Enoch 2011.  Matti Eklund develops this worry about reference determination in an especially powerful way (Eklund 2017).  He argues that a constraint on a plausible theory of reference determination must ensure that what he calls the \u201cnormative role\u201d (roughly, the practical role played by normative predicates in our deliberations about what to do) must be sufficient to determine a unique non-natural referent.  Otherwise, it will be possible for there to be other communities to use apparently normative predicates to refer to different non-natural properties.  This constraint is very far from trivial to satisfy; Eklund suggests that Wedgwood\u2019s theory is unique in trying to meet it.  By contrast, a form of non-naturalism like the one defended by Cuneo and Shafer-Landau (Cuneo and Shafer Landau 2014) seems ill-suited to meeting this constraint.   On their view, the reference of moral terms and concepts is fixed, in part by more substantive \u201cfixed points\u201d which would seem to go beyond the mere normative role that Eklund has in mind.  Although Eklund admits the worry he has is in some ways ineffable, it seems like there ought to be some way in which the properties picked out by our normative predicates are the \u201cright\u201d ones to care about.  The reason Eklund\u2019s worry is perhaps ineffable is that we presumably must index \u201cright\u201d in \u201cright ones to care about\u201d either to what we mean by \u201cright\u201d or by what some deviant possible community means by \u201cright,\u201d but neither seems to capture the intended worry.  Eklund notes the obvious analogies with the \u201cMoral Twin Earth\u201d objection to naturalism. \n",
