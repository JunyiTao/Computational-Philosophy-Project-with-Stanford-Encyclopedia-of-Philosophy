    "main_text": "The Standard Account and the Rationality of Hope\n3. The Standard Account and the Rationality of Hope\n\nThe contemporary debate about hope in analytic philosophy is primarily\nconcerned with providing a definition of hope, explicating standards\nof rationality and explaining the value of hope. The debate takes as\nits starting point what has been called the \u201corthodox\ndefinition\u201d (Martin 2013: 11) or the \u201cstandard\naccount\u201d (Meirav 2009: 217), which analyzes \u201chope that\np\u201d in terms of a wish or desire for p and a\nbelief concerning p\u2019s possibility. R.S. Downie is\nrepresentative of this position:\n\n\nThere are two criteria which are independently necessary and jointly\nsufficient for \u2018hope that\u2019. The first is that the object of\nhope must be desired by the hoper. [\u2026] The second [\u2026] is that the\nobject of hope falls within a range of physical possibility which\nincludes the improbable but excludes the certain and the merely\nlogically possible. (Downie 1963: 248f.)\n\n\nSimilarly, J. P. Day writes:\n\n\n\u201cA hopes that p\u201d is true iff\n\u201cA wishes that p, and A thinks that\np has some degree of probability, however small\u201d is\ntrue. (Day 1969: 89)\n\n\nThe desire-condition captures the intuition that we only hope for what\nwe take to be good (at least in some respect) or desirable. The belief\ncomponent is meant to capture the intuition that we do not normally\nhope for what we think is impossible (or certain), whereas this is not\na problem for desires or wishes (in e.g., \u201cI wish I could\nfly\u201d).\n\nMost authors implicitly assume that the hoped-for event is in the\nfuture. In ordinary usage however, people often express hopes\nregarding past events of which they do not have complete knowledge. An\nexample is the hope that someone did not suffer excessively when they\ndied. While some authors consider this use of language to be parasitic\non the future-directed case (McGeer 2004: 104), others argue that\nthese are genuine cases of hope (Martin 2013: 68).\n\nAnother question in this context concerns the concept of possibility\nthat is at issue: It seems clear that we cannot hope for the logically\nimpossible, but can we hope for the physically impossible, e.g., that\nthe dead will rise tomorrow? Downie, for example, holds that logical\npossibility is not enough (Downie 1963: 249), whereas Chignell does\nnot exclude the possibility of hope for something which is physically\nimpossible (Chignell 2013: 201ff.). Whatever the answer to this\nquestion, all views (except Wheatley 1958) allow for cases of hope in\nwhich the outcome is extremely improbable; in other words, no lower\nbound to the probability is required for hoping (Meirav 2009:\n219).\n\nObjections have been raised against the idea that the standard\ndefinition provides sufficient conditions for hope. There are two main\nlines of objections: the \u201cdespair objection\u201d and the\n\u201csubstantial hope objection\u201d (Milona 2020a: 103).\nAccording to the \u201cdespair objection\u201d, two people can have\nidentical desires and beliefs about the possibility of an outcome, and\nyet one of them may hope for the outcome while the other despairs of\nit (Meirav 2009). The \u201csubstantial hope objection\u201d holds\nthat even though the standard definition might capture a minimal sense\nof hope, it fails to explain the special value of more\n\u201csubstantial\u201d kinds of hope. In particular, it fails to\nexplain how hope can have special motivating force in difficult\ncircumstances, especially when the probability of the desired outcome\nis low (Pettit 2004; Calhoun 2018). These objections either lead to\nthe claim that the standard definition must be revised or motivate the\nproposal that hope is entirely different from desire and belief, and\nhence irreducible to them.\n\nLuc Bovens suggests that besides desire and belief, hope also involves\nmental imaging (Bovens 1999). However, it has been objected\nthat mental imaging is already entailed by desire (and hence, that the\nstandard definition can account for this) and that it is still not\nable to distinguish hope from despair, since a despairing person can\nstill form mental images about the desired outcome. Andrew Chignell\nsuggests a variant of Bovens\u2019 account, although he does not\nrequire imaging but a specific kind of attention: A subject who hopes\nis disposed to focus on the desired outcome under the aspect of\nits possibility, while a despairing subject focuses on the\noutcome under the aspect of its improbability (Chignell\nforthcoming).\n\nAccording to Meirav\u2019s \u201cExternal Factor Account\u201d\n(Meirav 2009: 230), hope also involves an attitude towards an external\nfactor (e.g., nature, fate, God) on which the realization of the\nhoped-for end causally depends. \u201cIf one views the external\nfactor as good, then one hopes for the prospect. If one views it as\nnot good, then one despairs of it\u201d (Meirav 2009: 230). However,\nit is doubtful whether Meirav\u2019s account is applicable to cases\nof hope where the realization of the outcome depends on luck (e.g.,\nhoping to win the lottery). Further, it seems that one might hope even\nin circumstances where one believes the external factor to be bad,\ne.g., in unjust political circumstances.\n\nWhile Meirav aims to answer the despair objection, Philip Pettit and\nCheshire Calhoun suggest solutions to the substantial hope objection.\nIn order to capture the motivating power of hope, Pettit distinguishes\nthe \u201csuperficial\u201d kind of hope described by the orthodox\ndefinition from a more \u201csubstantial\u201d hope (Pettit 2004:\n154). He construes substantial hope as acting on a belief that the\nagent does not really hold:\n\n\nHope will consist in acting as if a desired prospect is going to\nobtain or has a good chance of obtaining, just as precaution consists\nin acting as if this were the case with some feared prospect. (Pettit\n2004: 158)\n\n\nHowever, in typical cases, a hopeful person does not describe herself\nas acting as if the chances were higher, but as taking the\nchances as they are as good enough to try (Martin 2013: 23).\nCheshire Calhoun (2018) shares Adrienne Martin\u2019s criticism and argues\nthat we need to distinguish a \u2018planning idea\u2019 from a\n\u2018phenomenological idea\u2019 of the future: The third component\nof hope besides desire and belief, according to her, is \u201ca\nphenomenological idea of the determinate future whose content includes\nsuccess\u201d (Calhoun 2018: 86). This phenomenological idea,\nshe argues, has motivational effects independently of the\nagent\u2019s desires.\n\nAccording to Martin\u2019s suggestion (Martin 2013), hope involves\ntwo more elements in addition to belief and desire: First, the agent\nmust see or treat her belief about the possibility of the\noutcome\u2019s occurring as licensing hopeful activities,\ni.e., as not advising against some specific activities. Second, the\nagent must treat her attraction to the outcome as a practical\nreason to engage in the activities characteristic of hope. Martin\ncalls her account the Incorporation Thesis, which refers to\nthe fact that the hoping person incorporates the desire-element into\nher rational scheme of ends.\n\nMartin\u2019s proposal has been criticized as being overly reflective\nand unable to account for \u201crecalcitrant\u201d hopes where the\nhoping person does not see herself as justified in her\nhopeful activities (Milona and Stockdale 2018). Milona and Stockdale\noffer an account of hope that is inspired by the philosophy of\nemotions: They describe hope as a kind of perceptual state that\ninvolves a \u201chopeful\u201d feeling.\n\nThere is an ever-increasing number of accounts that aim to remedy the\nshortcomings of the standard definition (see also Kwong 2019,\nPalmqvist 2021). The discussion seems to come full circle with Michael\nMilona\u2019s return to the standard definition: Rather than\naugmenting the standard account, he suggests that one should employ a\nrich notion of desire and a suitable account of the relation\nbetween the desire and the belief\u2014the belief in the possibility\nof the outcome must be in the \u201ccognitive base\u201d of the\ndesire (Milona 2019).\n\nThe view that hope can be reduced to desires and beliefs (and a third\nfactor) is not without alternative, however. Segal and Textor (2015)\nargue that hope is a primitive mental state that can be\ncharacterized by its functional role; Bl\u00f6ser (2019) argues that hope\nis an irreducible concept. This latter view is compatible\nwith ontological variety and the view that different manifestations of\nhope are related in terms of family resemblance.\n\nAs for the norms of hope, there is consensus regarding the point that\nthere is a theoretical (or epistemic) and a practical aspect to the\nrationality of hope. On the theoretical side, the question is whether\nthe outcome is indeed possible (this amounts to evaluating hope in\nterms of its correctness) and whether the person is justified in her\ntaking the outcome to be possible (this amounts to evaluating hope in\nterms of justification or responsiveness to reasons). One question of\ndebate is whether the outcome must also be probable to a\ncertain degree in order for hope to be rational (for an affirmative\nanswer, see Moellendorf 2020 and Stockdale 2021). Andy Mueller\ncaptures the epistemic rationality of hope by specifying the idea that\n\u201choping that p\u201d is rationally incompatible with\n\u201cknowing that not-p\u201d (Mueller 2021: 45). (On the relation\nbetween hope and knowledge, see also Benton 2021).\n\nOn the practical side, most authors focus on the instrumental\nrationality of hope. Martin holds that hope is rational\n\u201cso long as it promotes her [the agent\u2019s] rational ends to\ndo these things [i.e. engage in hopeful activities such as acting to\npromote the end, fantasizing about the outcome, entertaining certain\nfeelings of anticipation]\u201d (Martin 2013). Similarly, Pettit\nemphasizes the instrumental value hope has for the pursuit of our ends\n(Pettit 2004: 161).\n\nHowever, the practical rationality of hope does not seem to be\nexhausted by instrumental considerations. Bovens argues that in\ncases where hoping has no instrumental value (because we cannot help\nbring about the desired state), hope can still have intrinsic\nvalue in virtue of its concomitant mental imaging: This characteristic\nof hope is responsible for its intrinsic value in three respects:\nFirst, hope has intrinsic value because the mental imaging connected to it (that is, the imaginative anticipation of the fulfillment of one\u2019s hope) is pleasurable\nin itself (Bovens 1999: 675f.). Second, hope has epistemic value\nbecause it increases one\u2019s self-understanding. Third, hope has\nintrinsic worth because it is constitutive of love towards others and\ntowards oneself, which are intrinsically valuable activities. It is in\nvirtue of mental imaging that hope is intimately connected to love,\nbecause spending mental energy in thinking about the well-being of\nanother person is constitutive of loving her. Bloeser and Stahl (2017)\nargue that certain hopes\u2014fundamental hopes\u2014can be rational\nin virtue of their contribution to the practical identity of the\nhoping person.\n\nFinally, it is a matter of debate how the theoretical and the\npractical dimension of rationality are related. On Martin\u2019s\naccount, the practical dimension has priority. Miriam Schleiffer\nMcCormick, by contrast, holds that the theoretical and practical\ndimensions equally contribute to hope\u2019s overall rationality and\nare intertwined (McCormick 2017).\n\nAnother approach to the value of hope explores the prospects of\nunderstanding hope as a virtue. Michael Milona interprets hope as a\nmoral virtue along the lines of \u201cgetting one\u2019s\npriorities straight\u201d (Milona 2020b). (For another attempt to\nunderstand hope as a moral virtue, see Han-Pile/Stern, forthcoming;\nfor a critical view of such an enterprise, see Bobier 2018.) Michael\nLamb aims to apply the structure of Thomas Aquinas\u2019 theological\nvirtue of hope to argue that hope can be a democratic virtue\nthat perfects acts of hoping in fellow citizens to achieve democratic\ngoods (Lamb 2016). Nancy Snow (2013) proposes that hope can be\nunderstood as an intellectual virtue. (For a critical\nassessment of Snow\u2019s approach, see Cobb 2015.)\n\nAccounts of hope as a virtue suggest that not all instances of hope\ncan be described as \u201chope that p\u201d, i.e., as\npropositional hopes that the standard definition and its successors\naim to analyze. There are two kinds of non-propositional hope that are\nsubject to debate (see Rioux 2021): First, as Lamb\u2019s account\nsuggests, we might have hope in a person, which Adrienne\nMartin calls \u201cinterpersonal hope\u201d (Martin 2020). Second,\nit has been suggested that there is an attitude of indeterminate hope\nthat is able to survive the loss of particular, determinate hopes. The\ndistinction between \u201chope that\u201d and hope without a\ndeterminate object has been introduced into the philosophical\ndiscourse by Gabriel Marcel and has recently been taken up (with or\nwithout explicit reference to Marcel) by otherwise different accounts.\nJoseph Godfrey calls hope without object \u201cfundamental\nhope\u201d and bases his account on an analysis of Bloch, Kant and\nMarcel (Godfrey 1987). Patrick Shade\u2019s pragmatist theory\ndistinguishes particular hopes and hopefulness as \u201can openness\nto possibilities that are meaningful and promising for us\u201d\n(Shade 2001: 139). Jonathan Lear similarly describes \u201cradical\nhope\u201d as a sense of a future in which \u201csomething good will\nemerge\u201d (Lear 2006: 94), even though all particular hopes were\ndestroyed; and Matthew Ratcliffe takes such radical hope as an\ninstance of \u201cpre-intentional hope\u201d, which is\n\n\na kind of general orientation or sense of how things are with the\nworld, in the context of which intentional states of the kind \u201cI\nhope that p\u201d are possible.
