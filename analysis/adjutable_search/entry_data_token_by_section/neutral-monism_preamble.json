    "main_text": "\n\nNeutral monism is a monistic metaphysics. It holds that ultimate\nreality is all of one kind. To this extent neutral monism is in\nagreement with the more familiar versions of monism: idealism and\nmaterialism. What distinguishes neutral monism from its monistic\nrivals is the claim that the intrinsic nature of ultimate reality is\nneither mental nor material but rather, in some sense, neutral between\nthe two.\n\nNeutral monism is compatible with the existence of many neutral\nentities or kinds. And neutral monism is compatible with the existence\nof non-neutral entities or kinds\u2014mental and material ones, for\nexample\u2014provided that they are, in some sense, derivative of\nultimate reality\u2019s neutral intrinsic nature. Most versions of\nneutral monism have been pluralist in both these respects. They were\nconceived as solutions to the mind-body problem. Their goal was to\nclose the apparent chasm between mental and material entities by\nexhibiting both as grounded in more basic neutral entities.\n\nAny version of neutral monism will therefore have to answer the\nfollowing three questions: (1) What are the neutral entities and what\nis their nature?, (2) What is the relationship of these neutral\nentities to matter?, and (3) What is the relationship of these neutral\nentities to mind?\n",
