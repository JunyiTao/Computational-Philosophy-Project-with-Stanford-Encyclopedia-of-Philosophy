    "main_text": "Philosophy and the Human Genome Project\n2. Philosophy and the Human Genome Project\n\nAt an October 1988 news conference called to announce his appointment,\nWatson, in an apparently off-the-cuff response to a reporter who asked\nabout the social implications of the project, promised that a portion\nof the funding would be set aside to study such issues (Marshall\n1996b). The result was the NIH/DOE Joint Working Group on Ethical,\nLegal, and Social Implications (ELSI) of Human Genome Research,\nchaired by Nancy Wexler, which began to meet in September 1989. The\nJoint Working Group identified four areas of high priority:\n\u201cquality and access in the use of genetic tests; fair use of\ngenetic information by employers and insurers; privacy and\nconfidentiality of genetic information; and public and professional\neducation\u201d (Wexler in Cooper 1994, p. 321). The NIH and DOE each\nestablished ELSI programs: philosopher Eric T. Juengst served as the\nfirst director of the NIH-NCHGR ELSI program from 1990 to 1994. ELSI\nwas funded initially to the tune of three percent of the HGP budget\nfor both agencies; this was increased to four and later five percent\nat the NIH, a huge boost in bioethics funding, on the order of tens of\nmillions of dollars each year.\n\nEthical issues such as genetic privacy, access to genetic testing, and\ngenetic discrimination were not the only considerations of interest to\nphilosophers, and besides ethicists, philosophers of science,\npolitical theorists and philosophers working in other areas benefited\nfrom ELSI-related funding. There is now a vast literature on human\ngenome-related topics. From among these topics, this section attempts\nto provide a synopsis of those that are most directly associated with\nthe HGP itself, of greatest concern and enduring interest to\nphilosophers, and not covered in other SEP entries. Since\nthere is interest in exporting the ELSI model to other biomedical\ncontexts, such as neuroscience, consideration is also given to its\nlegacy.\n",
