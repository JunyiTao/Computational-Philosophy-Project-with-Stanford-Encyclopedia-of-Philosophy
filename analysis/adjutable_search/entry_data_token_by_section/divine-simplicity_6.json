    "main_text": "Constituent Versus Nonconstituent Ontology || God and Mann: DDS and Property-Instances\n3.4 God and Mann: DDS and Property-Instances\n\nWilliam Mann cites a couple of difficulties that arise if the divine\nattributes are said to be identical to each other. The first is that\nif God = wisdom, and God = life, then wisdom = life. But wisdom and\nlife are not even extensionally equivalent, let alone identical. If\nTom is alive, it doesn\u2019t follow that Tom is wise (Mann 2015,\n23). The second difficulty is that if God is wisdom, and Socrates is\nwise by participating in wisdom, then Socrates is wise by\nparticipating in God. But this smacks of heresy. No creature\nparticipates in God (Mann 2015, 23). The problem arises if the divine\nattributes are thought to be universals.\n\nEnter property instances. It is one thing to say that God is wisdom,\nquite another to say that God is God\u2019s wisdom.\nGod\u2019s wisdom is an example of a property instance. And similarly\nfor the other divine attributes. God is not identical to life; God is\nidentical to his life. Suppose we say that God = God\u2019s\nwisdom, and God = God\u2019s life. It would then follow that\nGod\u2019s wisdom = God\u2019s life, but not that God = wisdom or\nthat wisdom = life. So if we construe identity with properties as\nidentity with property instances, then we can evade both of the above\ndifficulties. Mann\u2019s idea, then, is that the identity claims\nmade within DDS should be taken as Deity-instance identities (e.g.,\nGod is his omniscience) and as instance-instance identities (e.g.,\nGod\u2019s omniscience is God\u2019s omnipotence), but not as\nDeity-property identities (e.g., God is omniscience) or as\nproperty-property identities (e.g., omniscience is omnipotence).\nSupport for Mann\u2019s approach is readily available in the texts of\nthe doctor angelicus (Mann 2015, 24). Aquinas says things\nlike, Deus est sua bonitas, \u201cGod is his\ngoodness.\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is a property instance? If the concrete individual\nSocrates instantiates the abstract universal property wisdom, then two\nfurther putative items come into consideration. One is the\n(Chisholmian-Plantingian as opposed to Bergmannian-Armstrongian) state\nof affairs, Socrates\u2019 being wise. Such items are abstract, i.e.,\nnot in space or time. The other is the property instance, the wisdom\nof Socrates. Mann rightly holds that they are distinct. All abstract\nstates of affairs exist, but only some of them obtain or are actual.\nBy contrast, all property instances are actual: they cannot exist\nwithout being actual. The wisdom of Socrates is a particular, an\nunrepeatable item, just as Socrates is, and the wisdom of Socrates is\nconcrete (in space and/or time) just as Socrates is. If we admit\nproperty instances into our ontology, then the above two difficulties\ncan be circumvented. Or so Mann maintains.\n\nBut then other problems loom. One is this. If the F-ness of God = God,\nif, for example, the wisdom of God = God, then God is a property\ninstance. But God is a person. How could a person be a property\ninstance? From the frying pan into the fire? How could the stupendous\nand super-eminent reality of God be reduced to something as\nontologically flimsy as a property instance? The problem displayed as\nan inconsistent triad: (a) God is a property instance; (b) God is a\nperson; (c) No person is a property instance.\n\nMann solves the triad by denying (c) (2015, 37). Some persons are\nproperty instances. Indeed, Mann argues that every person is a\nproperty instance because everything is a property instance. (2015,\n38) God is a person and therefore a property instance. If you object\nthat persons are concrete while property instances are abstract,\nMann\u2019s response is that both are concrete (2015, 37). To be\nconcrete is to be in space and/or time (2015, 37). Socrates is\nconcrete in this sense, but so is his being sunburned.\n\nIf you object that persons are substances and thus independent items\nwhile property instances are not substances but dependent on\nsubstances, Mann\u2019s response will be that the point holds for\naccidental property instances but not for essential property\ninstances. Socrates may lose his wisdom but he cannot lose his\nhumanity. Now all of God\u2019s properties are essential: God is\nessentially omniscient, omnipotent, etc. So it seems to Mann that\n\u201cthe omniscience of God is not any more dependent on God than\nGod is on the omniscience of God: should either cease to be, the other\nwould also.\u201d (2015, 37) This is scarcely compelling: x can\ndepend on y even if both are necessary beings. Both the set whose sole\nmember is the number 7 and the number 7 itself are necessary beings,\nbut the set depends on its member both for its existence and its\nnecessity, and not vice versa. Closer to home, Aquinas held that some\nnecessary beings have their necessity from another while one has its\nnecessity in itself. I should think that the omniscience of God is\ndependent on God, and not vice versa. Mann\u2019s view, however, is\nnot unreasonable. Intuitions vary.\n\nMann\u2019s argument for the thesis that everything is a property\ninstance involves the notion of a rich property. The rich property of\nan individual x is a conjunctive property the conjuncts of\nwhich are all and only the essential and accidental properties, some\nof them temporally indexed, instantiated by x throughout\nx\u2019s career (2015, 38). Mann tells us that for anything\nwhatsoever there is a corresponding rich property. From this he\nconcludes that \u201ceverything is a property instance of some rich\nproperty or other\u201d (38). It follows that every person is a\nproperty instance. The argument seems to be this: (a) For every\nconcrete individual x, there is a corresponding rich property\nR. Therefore, (b) for every concrete individual x,\nx is a property instance of some rich property or other.\nTherefore, (c) For every concrete individual x, if x\nis a person, then x is a property instance.\n\nVallicella (2016, 379) argues that the move from (a) to (b) smacks of\na non sequitur absent some auxiliary premise. Let it be granted\narguendo that for each concrete individual x there\nis a corresponding rich property R. And let it be granted\nthat there are property instances. So, in addition to Socrates and\nwisdom, there is the wisdom of Socrates. Recall that this property\ninstance is not to be confused with the abstract state of affairs,\nSocrates\u2019 being wise. From what has been granted it follows that\nfor each x there is the rich property instance, the R-ness of\nx. But how is it supposed to follow that everything is a\nproperty instance? Everything instantiates properties, and in this\nsense everything is an instance of properties; but this is not to say\nthat everything is a property instance. Socrates instantiates a rich\nproperty, and so is an instance of a property, but it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that Socrates is a property instance. Something seems to be\nmissing in Mann\u2019s argument.\n\nThere is of course no chance that Mann is confusing being an instance\nof a property with being a property instance. If a\ninstantiates F-ness, then a is an instance of the\nproperty F-ness; but a is not a property instance as\nphilosophers use this phrase: the F-ness of a is a\nproperty instance. So what do we have to add to Mann\u2019s argument\nfor it to generate the conclusion that every concrete individual is a\nproperty instance? How do we validate the inferential move from (a) to\n(b)? Let \u2018Rs\u2019 stand for\nSocrates\u2019 rich property. We have to add the claim that there is\nnothing one could point to that could distinguish Socrates from the\nproperty instance generated when Socrates instantiates\nRs. Rich property instances are a special case of\nproperty instances. Socrates cannot be identical to his wisdom because\nhe can exist even if his wisdom does not exist. And he cannot be\nidentical to his humanity because there is more to Socrates that his\nhumanity, even though he cannot exist without it. But since\nSocrates\u2019 rich property instance includes all his property\ninstances, why can\u2019t Socrates be identical to this rich property\ninstance? And so Mann\u2019s thought seems to be that there is\nnothing that could distinguish Socrates from his rich property\ninstance. So they are identical. And likewise for every other\nindividual. But it is arguable that it is a mistake to hold that every\nperson is a property instance. Here (Vallicella 2016 379\u2013380) is\none argument.\n\nRich Properties and Haecceity Properties. Socrates can exist\nwithout his rich property; ergo, he can exist without his rich\nproperty instance; ergo, Socrates cannot be a rich property instance\nor any property instance. The truth of the initial premise is fallout\nfrom the definition of \u2018rich property.\u2019 The R of\nx is a conjunctive property each conjunct of which is a\nproperty of x. Thus Socrates\u2019 rich property includes\n(has as a conjunct) the property of being married to Xanthippe. But\nSocrates might not have had that property, whence it follows that he\nmight not have had R. (If R has C as a\nconjunct, then necessarily R has C as a conjunct,\nwhich implies that R cannot be what it is without having\nexactly the conjuncts it in fact has. An analog of mereological\nessentialism holds for conjunctive properties.) And because Socrates\nmight not have had R, he might not have had the property\ninstance of R. So Socrates cannot be identical to this\nproperty instance. What Mann needs is not a rich property, but an\nhaecceity property: one that individuates Socrates across every\npossible world in which he exists. His rich property, by contrast,\nindividuates him in only the actual world. In different worlds,\nSocrates has different rich properties. And in different worlds,\nSocrates has different rich property instances. It follows that\nSocrates cannot be identical to, or even necessarily equivalent to,\nany rich property instance. An haecceity property, however, is a\nproperty Socrates has in every world in which he exists, and which he\nalone has in every world in which he exists. Now if there are such\nhaecceity properties as identity-with-Socrates, then perhaps we can\nsay that Socrates is identical to a property instance, namely, the\nidentity-with-Socrates of Socrates. Unfortunately, there are powerful\narguments for rejecting haecceity properties (Vallicella 2002,\n99\u2013104). So we ought to conclude that concrete individuals\ncannot be identified with property instances, whence follows the\nperhaps obvious proposition that no person is a property instance, not\nGod, not me, not Socrates.\n",
