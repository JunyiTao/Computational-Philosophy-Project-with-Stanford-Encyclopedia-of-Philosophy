    "main_text": "Alienation and Human Flourishing || The Basic Idea\n2.1 The Basic Idea\n\nAlienation is a concept especially, but not uniquely, associated with\nMarx\u2019s work, and the intellectual tradition that he helped\nfound. It identifies a distinct kind of social ill, involving a\nseparation between a subject and an object that properly belong\ntogether. The subject here is typically an individual or a group,\nwhile the object is usually an \u201centity\u201d which variously is\nnot itself a subject, is another subject(s), or is the original\nsubject (that is, the relation here can be reflexive). And the\nrelation between the relevant subject and object is one of problematic\nseparation. Both elements of that characterisation are important. Not\nall social ills, of course, involve separations; for instance, being\noverly integrated into some object might be dysfunctional, but it is\nnot characteristic of alienation. Moreover, not all separations are\nproblematic, and accounts of alienation typically appeal to some\nbaseline unity or harmony that is frustrated or violated by the\nseparation in question.\n\nTheories of alienation vary considerably, but frequently: first,\nidentify a subset of these problematic separations as being of\nparticular importance; second, include an account (sometimes implicit)\nof what makes the relevant separations problematic; and, third,\npropound some explanatory claims about the extent of, and prognosis\nfor, alienation, so understood.\n",
