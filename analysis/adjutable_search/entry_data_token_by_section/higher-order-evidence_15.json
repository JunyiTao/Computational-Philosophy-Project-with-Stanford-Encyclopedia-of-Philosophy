    "main_text": "Dilemmas and Two-Norm Views || Propositional justification vs. doxastic justification\n5. Conclusion\n\nWe began by noting that higher-order evidence gives rise to a puzzle.\nIt seems that \u201chigher-order evidence\u201d\u2014information\nabout our own irrationality or unreliability\u2014should prompt us to\nrevise our beliefs about the world, but if we do so, we must ignore\nevidence and reasoning that is directly relevant to the truth of those\nbeliefs. Much of the literature on higher-order evidence revolves\naround this puzzle: arguing that we should reject one side of the\npuzzle or the other, or finding ways to hold onto both.\n\nAs of this writing, two related questions emerge as central to the\ndebate going forward. First: is higher-order evidence significant\nbecause it gives us information about our own rationality? Or\nbecause it gives us information about our own reliability?\nAnd second: are there genuine norms prohibiting epistemic akrasia?\n(So, should our beliefs about what\u2019s rational line up\nwith our beliefs about the world?) Or does the appearance of these\nnorms merely arise because of nearby norms regarding\nreliability\u2014or, perhaps, because there are multiple, conflicting\nmodes of epistemic normativity? Untangling the puzzles surrounding\nhigher-order evidence will ultimately involve answering these\nquestions as well, as well as broader questions about the relationship\nbetween rationality and truth.\n",
