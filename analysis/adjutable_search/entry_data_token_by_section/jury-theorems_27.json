    "main_text": "Other Types of Jury Theorems || Jury theorems for voters tracking individual facts\n5.6 Jury theorems for voters tracking individual facts\n\nOrdinary jury theorems assume the classic paradigm of epistemic\ndemocracy: collective decisions should be correct, and individuals\nvote for what they believe to be correct. But collective correctness\ncan emerge even if voters do not pursue it. For instance, decisions\ncan serve the collective interest even if voters vote for what they\nbelieve serves their personal interest. This is the message of\njury theorems for voters tracking individual facts. They\nfollow a semi-epistemic paradigm of democracy: collective decisions\nshould still be correct, but voters express judgments about individual\nfacts.\n\nWithin this paradigm, what vote is correct depends on the individual.\nThe rationale could be that votes express judgments about\nagent-indexed facts, for instance about which alternative is best\nfor oneself, i.e., serves one\u2019s own interest.\nObviously, correctness of judgments like \u201coption X is\nin my interest\u201d is voter-dependent. An entirely\ndifferent rationale for voter-dependent correctness is that\ncorrectness facts are subjective\u2014a meta-ethical thesis sometimes\nadvanced for normative facts. Either way, an individual might not know\nwith certainty which alternative is individually correct (e.g., serves\ntheir own interest or is subjectively correct). Individual competence,\nin this framework, is the ability to track one\u2019s own correctness\nfact.\n\nWhich truth does the group track in its aggregate decision?\nThe collective correctness standard combines the individual standards.\nCollective correctness could, for instance, be defined as correctness\nfor most\n individuals.[33]\n The natural procedure to track this collective truth is majority\nvoting (assuming there are just two alternatives). Still, majority\noutcomes may be collectively incorrect, as individuals may cast\nindividually incorrect votes. Yet, under some stylized assumptions,\nincluding broadly Condorcetian competence and independence\nassumptions, majority voting can generate increasingly reliable and\npossibly asymptotically infallible outcomes (see theorems conjectured\nby Miller 1986 and List & Spiekermann 2016).\n\nBut this standard of collective correctness can be questioned. It\nrests solely on how often an alternative is individually\ncorrect. Yet it might also matter how strongly\nsomeone\u2019s correctness standard (e.g., her welfare) is satisfied\nor violated. This becomes evident in concrete\n examples.[34]\n To account for degrees, let a correctness standard be given by a\nvalue function \\(V\\), assigning a value or correctness degree to each\nalternative, formally \\(V:\\mathcal{A}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\). If\n\\(V_{1},V_{2},\\ldots\\) are the (unknown) value functions of the\nindividuals \\(1,2,\\ldots\\), respectively, how valuable or correct are\nalternatives collectively? Under an additive approach, the\ncollective value function is \\(V_{1}+\\cdots+V_{n}\\). If individual\nvalue represents individual welfare or interest, then such additive\ncollective value represents utilitarian collective welfare; but\nnothing hinges on a welfarist interpretation of value. An alternative\nin \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is now correct (individually or collectively) if it\nmaximises the relevant value function. Here collective correctness no\nlonger reduces to correctness for most individuals.\nPivato\u2019s (2016) statistical utilitarianism\ntheorem\u2014initially a theorem about making approximately\nutilitarian-optimal decisions\u2014can be interpreted as a jury\ntheorem for individual correctness of this graded kind and collective\ncorrectness of additive\n kind.[35]\n\nJury theorems with voters tracking individual facts depart from\nordinary jury frameworks and classic epistemic democracy in two\nfundamental ways. First, different voters track different\n\u201ctruths\u201d, against the epistemic conception of democracy.\nSecond, the collectively correct alternative depends on group size\n\\(n\\), hence is a moving target that changes as voters are added.\nStill, such theorems make a remarkable point: voting in pursuit of the\nindividual good can create the collective good, as if through an\ninvisible hand. Democracy finds the collective truth even if voters\nsearch for different, purely individual, truths. But does democracy\nfind the collective truth more easily if voters express\njudged individual truth or judged collective truth? This is an open\nquestion for epistemic democracy.\n",
