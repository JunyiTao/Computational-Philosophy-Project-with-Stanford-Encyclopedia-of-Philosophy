    "preamble": "\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b (1149\u20131210) was one of the\nmost innovative and influential thinkers in the first stage of what is\nsometimes called \u201cpost-classical\u201d Islamic thought. Along\nwith other major thinkers of the Islamic East in the twelfth century,\nnotably Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b and\nal-Suhraward\u012b, Fakhr al-D\u012bn reacted critically to the\nphilosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna). He produced a voluminous\ncorpus that is often elusive in terms of conveying Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn\u2019s own considered opinions, but is packed with subtle\nphilosophical argumentation on pretty well every aspect of Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s thought. Fakhr al-D\u012bn did also stake out\ndistinctive positions of his own, for example with respect to the\nproblem of providing real definitions, the distinction between essence\nand existence, the principles of physics, the unity of the human soul,\nand the source of ethical norms. This abundant output in philosophy\nwas only one part of his life\u2019s work, which includes texts on\nIslamic law, theology, astrology, and one of history\u2019s most\nimportant commentaries on the Quran.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s life was shaped by the\npolitical situation in central Asia in the generations just before the\nMongol conquest of that region. He was born in the Persian city of\nRayy, near modern-day Tehran, in 1149 CE (544 of the Muslim calendar).\nThe name \u201cR\u0101z\u012b\u201d refers to this birthplace,\nleading to potential confusion with other philosophers from Rayy,\nincluding the earlier Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b (d. 920) and the\nlater Qu\u1e6db al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b (d.1364). Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn did not stay in Rayy, but traveled widely throughout\nPersia and central Asia for the rest of his life in search of\neducation, patronage, and worthy intellectual opponents. In fact, he\ndid not need to venture far for his initial education. His father was\nan expert in Islamic theology and law, a second-generation student of\nthe major Ash\u02bfarite thinker al-Juwayn\u012b (d.1085). Thus the\nyoung Fakhr al-D\u012bn was from early on trained in the rational\ntheology (kal\u0101m) of the Ash\u02bfarite school and the\nlegal system of his father\u2019s Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b school. He\nwent on to study in Nishapur, where he first encountered the works of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d.950\u201351) and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n(Avicenna, d.1037). Responding to the latter would become the central\nproject of his own philosophical career. At Mar\u0101gha, he studied\nwith the teacher Majd al-D\u012bn al-J\u012bl\u012b (d. after 1175).\nAl-Suhraward\u012b (d. 1191), the famous founder of the\n\u201cIlluminationist\u201d philosophical tradition, was also a\nstudent of al-J\u012bl\u012b\u2019s.\n\nThe mature career of Fakhr al-D\u012bn has been divided into three\nphases in a recent detailed overview of his life (Griffel 2021:\n264\u2013303; see also Street 1997, Griffel 2007, Alta\u015f 2013a\nand 2013b, Shihadeh 2022). These phases were marked by patronage\nrelationships with two political powers who were vying for dominance\nin central Asia, the Khw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101hs and the Gh\u016brids.\nFakhr al-D\u012bn first enjoyed the support of the\nKhw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101hs for about two decades, before joining the\nGh\u016brids in 1197 after a military defeat of the\nKhw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101hs at the hands of the Gh\u016brids. By all\naccounts this led to great wealth and standing, as Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nbecame an ornament to the Gh\u016brid court and a close companion and\nteacher of the sultan Ghiy\u0101th al-D\u012bn (d.1203). This did not\nmean he could stay above the political fray, though. He was accused of\nlingering loyalty to the enemies of the court and was also involved in\na religious rivalry between Ash\u02bfarism and the more literalist,\nless rationalist Karr\u0101mite theological movement. His travels in\nTransoxania seeking out debates with other jurists and theologians\nhave similarly been explained as an attempt to promote Ash\u02bfarite\nkal\u0101m against Matur\u012bd\u012b opponents, and\nSh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b legal thought against Hanbal\u012b opponents\n(for his legal thought see, e.g., Opwis 2012, Ba\u015fo\u011flu 2014).\nIn a record of these encounters around the year 1186, called\nDebates (Mun\u0101\u1e93ar\u0101\u1e6d), Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn presents himself as \u201cthe only respectable scholar\namong a swarm of dimwits\u201d (Griffel 2021: 296; for this work see\nKholeif 1966). At the end of his life, we see a third phase of\npatronage as he rejoins the Khw\u0101razm-Sh\u0101hs after they take\nthe city of Herat from the Gh\u016brids. Fakhr al-D\u012bn died two\nyears later in that city, in 1210 CE (606 of the Muslim calendar).\n\nDespite his extensive travels and political maneuvering, Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn found time to compose a startlingly large body of work.\nMany will associate his name most immediately with his titanic\nGreat Commentary on the Quran (also called Keys to the\nHidden: Maf\u0101\u1e6dih al-ghayb). The modern\nprinting runs to no fewer than 32 volumes (here it is almost\nobligatory to cite Ibn Taymiyya\u2019s barb that the work\n\u201ccontains everything apart from exegesis of the Quran\u201d).\nFakhr al-D\u012bn wrote extensively on law, theology, and\n\u201coccult sciences\u201d like magic and astrology. As can be\nlearned from studies of his Quranic commentary (Jaffer 2015) and a\ntreatise of his on the occult disciplines (Noble 2021), every work of\nFakhr al-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b can be profitably read with his\nphilosophical interests in mind. But in this overview we will largely\nrestrict our focus to the theological-philosophical treatises that are\nof most evident importance for the historian of philosophy. Scholars\nsometimes refer to these as summae, which suggests a parallel\nwith Latin scholastic works like those by Thomas Aquinas. The\ncomparison is not misleading, insofar as Fakhr al-D\u012bn was\navowedly a theologian, but one who pursued philosophical problems at\nlength and with great sophistication.\n\nA couple of problems confront anyone who is trying to come to grips\nwith his writings in this area. First, the sheer quantity of material.\nHis first summa, entitled Eastern Points of Investigation\non Metaphysics and Physics (al-Mab\u0101\u1e25ith\nal-mashriqiyya f\u012b \u02bfilm al-il\u0101hiyy\u0101t\nwa-l-\u1e6dab\u012b\u02bfiyy\u0101t) is more than 1200 pages\nlong in the modern printing. His final summa, written in his\nfinal years and arguably best representing his own views on a wide\nrange of topics, is the similarly titled Exalted Topics of Inquiry\nwithin Divine Science (al-Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib\nal-\u02bf\u0101liya min al-\u02bfilm al-il\u0101h\u012b) and is\nprinted in nine books bound in five volumes. In between these two\nworks we have, among other texts, the shorter but highly innovative\nand influential Mulakhkha\u1e63 al-\u1e25ikma (Epitome\nof Philosophy) and not one but two exegetical works devoted to\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s Pointers and Reminders\n(al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t wa-l-tanb\u012bh\u0101t), a critical\nabridgment from 1201 (Lubab al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t) and an\nearlier, and very extensive, line-by-line critical commentary\n(Shar\u1e25 al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s decision to devote such a detailed\ncommentary to a work by Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 is historically revealing.\nWhile his contemporary Sharaf al-D\u012bn al-Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b\n(d. before 1204) did compose a set of Doubts\n(Shuk\u016bk) on the same text, the commentary of\nal-R\u0101z\u012b on al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t seems to be the\nfirst lemmatized exegesis of an Arabic philosophical work (see also\nWisnovsky 2013, Shihadeh 2014 and 2017), as had been devoted to\nAristotle in late antiquity and earlier Arabic philosophy. Even a\ncasual perusal of Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s corpus makes clear that he\nhas identified Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 as the chief representative of\nfalsafa, a word which is most naturally translated\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d (since it is likewise derived from the Greek\nphilosophia) but which really has a narrower meaning in this\nperiod, since it is so closely tied to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\ndistinctive teachings. To be a faylas\u016bf is to uphold\nsuch doctrines as the necessary and eternal emanation of the universe\nfrom God. (A more generic word for the discussion of such issues,\nwithout any particular doctrinal commitment, would be\n\u1e25ikma, literally meaning \u201cwisdom\u201d; see\nGriffel 2021.) While Fakhr al-D\u012bn follows his famous predecessor\nand fellow Ash\u02bfarite al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (d. 1111) in targeting\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 as the outstanding exponent of falsafa, he\ndoes not go along with al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s idea that the\nfal\u0101sifa were heretics and apostates from Islam.\n\nInstead, he seems to welcome the powerful challenge posed by Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s thought, since it gives him something worthy of\nhis own considerable critical acumen and helps him to map out the wide\nrange of issues tackled in his summae. These fall into the\ndomains of logic, physics, psychology, ethics, and above all,\nmetaphysics (general survey in Zark\u0101n 1963). Indeed Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn used metaphysics to restructure the curriculum of the\nsciences, something we especially see in his Mulakhkha\u1e63\n(Eichner 2007, 2009). This work adopts a new arrangement, which would\nbe influential on later thinkers. Fakhr al-D\u012bn first tackles\nlogic, then \u201cgeneralities (al-um\u016br\nal-\u02bf\u0101mma)\u201d, then natural philosophy, and finally\nphilosophical theology. The second and fourth parts of the project\ncorrespond to what is called general and special metaphysics in the\nLatin scholastic tradition, and the parallel does not end there. Like\nDuns Scotus, Fakhr al-D\u012bn offers an analysis of existence (the\ncentral case of a metaphysical \u201cgenerality\u201d) by way of\ndisjunction, e.g., existence may be one or many, necessary or\ncontingent, infinite or finite, self-sufficient or dependent, etc.\nWhile these contrasts are largely drawn from Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn innovates with his systematic use of the disjunctions to\nstructure general metaphysics. This also means, as we will see below,\nthat his discussions of metaphysics are by no means restricted to\nraising and answering questions about God, as we might expect from a\n\u201ctheologian\u201d.\n\nIn fact, while Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s Ash\u02bfarite sympathies are\noften evident, and he does also write works that summarize\nkal\u0101m teachings, he is not consistent in taking a clear\nstance in favor of Ash\u02bfarite kal\u0101m and against\nAvicennan falsafa. Instead, the really stable feature of his\nwork is a method that is, again, reminiscent of Latin scholasticism\nand its genre of disputed questions. His various summae are\norganized into topics for inquiry (hence the use of words like\nmab\u0101\u1e25ith and ma\u1e6d\u0101lib in the\ntitles of the works), with arguments considered for and against every\nconceivable stance that could be adopted on each topic. (The famous\nSufi poet al-R\u016bm\u012b compared this approach to \u201ctearing\nscience apart like bread and feeding it to the birds\u201d.) The fact\nthat no actual historical figure or school has adopted a possible\nposition will not prevent Fakhr al-D\u012bn from considering it.\n\nBy using this \u201cdialectical\u201d procedure (Wisnovsky 2004,\nShihadeh 2005, Griffel 2011) Fakhr al-D\u012bn is able to stand in\njudgment over the whole historical tradition leading up to him.\nAlongside Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and other philosophers, notably the\nslightly earlier Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b (d.\n1160s), the kal\u0101m tradition supplies him with a stock of\npositions and arguments to rehearse and critique. He will thus\nfrequently refer in the third person to \u201ctheologians\n(mutakallim\u016bn)\u201d, as if this were a group that does\nnot include him. The upshot is that Fakhr al-D\u012bn puts himself\nforward as the arbiter in debates that span the\nfalsafa-kal\u0101m divide. If he is not consistent in\nadopting one or another teaching himself (many times, a lengthy\ninvestigation in his works ends with only a brief statement of the\nlikeliest answer, or none at all, followed with a pious \u201cbut God\nknows best\u201d), this is perhaps because the exhaustive method of\ntesting arguments and doctrines is more important to him than the\nassertion of any one doctrine.\n2. Logic and Epistemology\n\nIn the Islamic world, representatives of falsafa largely\naccept the traditional Aristotelian presentation of the manner of the\nacquisition of knowledge. This is the Peripatetic Organon,\nwhich starts from the predicables and moves through syllogistic to\ndemonstrative science and essential definitions. Fakhr al-D\u012bn,\nhowever, presents a different structure for logic and epistemology,\nwhich leaves the traditional organization of the Organon\nbehind. The new structure revolves around two ways of acquiring\nknowledge, conceptualization (ta\u1e63awwur) and assent\n(ta\u1e63d\u012bq) (El-Rouayheb 2019: 29).\n\u201cConceptualization\u201d stands for mentally entertaining a\nconcept, such as \u201chuman\u201d or \u201crational animal\u201d,\nwithout ascribing any truth-value to it, while \u201cassent\u201d\nstands for claiming that the human is rational animal in the real\nworld (Lameer 2006). Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s reorganization of logic\nand epistemology may have been one inspiration for later authors who\nre-define the subject matter of logic as \u201cthe objects of\nconception and assent\u201d (El-Rouayheb 2012).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn complements this picture with his critique of\ndefinitions, a rejection of the intentional acquisition of knowledge\nthrough conceptualization (Falaturi 1969, Ibrahim 2013, \u00d6zturan\n2018, Jacobsen Ben Hammed 2020, Benevich 2022a). According to the\ntraditional Aristotelian epistemology, wholly embraced by Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, we know what a human is by acquiring a complete\ndefinition of the essence of what it means to be a human, through a\ncombination of all inherent generic and specific aspects, for instance\n\u201cbeing an animal\u201d and \u201cbeing rational\u201d. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn denies that this is how we learn what things are. For him,\nas for his contemporaries Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t and\nal-Suhraward\u012b, the best that we can hope to achieve with the\ntraditional Aristotelian-Avicennan approach is a nominal definition,\nthe explication of a meaning we have in our minds\n(Mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al, 84; Mulakhkha\u1e63:\nMan\u1e6diq, 106). By defining humans as \u201crational\nanimals\u201d, we do not learn anything new about real humans.\nRather, we just explain what we meant by \u201chumans\u201d in the\nfirst place.\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s main argument against real definitions is a\nreapplication of an old epistemological problem that goes back to\nMeno\u2019s paradox in Plato (Meno, 80d6\u201310).\nAl-R\u0101z\u012b formulates it as follows:\n\n\nIf one is not aware of the object of inquiry, inquiry is impossible.\nFor, if one is entirely unaware of something, the soul undertakes no\ninquiry into it. If on the other hand one is aware of it,\ninquiry is again impossible, since it is absurd to make something\navailable when it is already available (ta\u1e25\u1e63\u012bl\nal-\u1e25\u0101\u1e63il).\n\n\nIf someone says: [the inquirer] is aware of [the object of\ninquiry] in some respect or other, I respond: the respect in\nwhich he is aware of it is distinct from the respect in which he is\nnot aware of it. [82] He cannot inquire into the first [respect],\nsince it is [already] available. Nor can he inquire into the second\n[respect], since he is absolutely unaware of it\n(Mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al, 81\u201382)\n\nHow can we learn something new if we do not even know what to look\nfor; and if we already know what we are looking for, what sense does\nit make to learn something new about it? Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 mostly accepted the Aristotelian solution to the\nparadox, namely that we can know something in one respect, and inquire\ninto it and learn something new about it in another respect (Black\n2008, Marmura 2009). Fakhr al-D\u012bn rejects this solution, on the\ngrounds that the problem may be applied to each aspect individually.\nIf we do not know one aspect but already know another aspect, new\ninquiry is impossible for both, with the two aspects falling prey to\nthe two different horns of the paradox.\n\nIn his analysis of the acquisition of knowledge, Fakhr al-D\u012bn\naddresses the traditional epistemological distinction inherited from\nkal\u0101m between \u201cnecessary\u201d\n(\u1e0dar\u016br\u012b) and \u201cacquired\u201d\n(iktis\u0101b\u012b) knowledge. We receive\n\u201cnecessary\u201d items of knowledge as a given, whether or not\nwe want to do so. For instance, when I look at a red apple, I have no\npower over seeing that the apple is red. I cannot just decide to see\nit as blue. By contrast, acquired knowledge means that we are\nintentionally involved in the acquisition of knowledge. I might for\ninstance try to learn why humans have certain features that belong to\nthem, though I need not do so (see further Abrahamov 1993, Radhi\nIbrahim 2013, Benevich 2022b). Fakhr al-D\u012bn goes against this\nstandard kal\u0101m account by denying the second type of\nknowledge. According to him, we do not have any power over our\nconceptualization of things, nor over any beliefs that derive from\nconceptualization (Arba\u02bf\u012bn, vol.1, 330\u2013332).\nRather, all items of conceptualization and assent are given to us,\nwhich in the occasionalist Ash\u02bfarite framework means given\ndirectly by God (Jacobsen Ben Hammed 2020, Benevich 2022a). We are\nthus \u201cforced\u201d to have whatever knowledge we wind up\nhaving. The nature of the objects known is not so clear: it has been\nargued that for Fakhr al-D\u012bn we can only get to objects of\nphenomenal experience (Ibrahim 2013), and also that for him we can get\nat the things in themselves (Benevich 2022a). Either way, the\nnecessary items of knowledge are the primary data for epistemic\nagents. We do not learn what humans are through an inquiry and by\nproducing essential definitions. We know what humans are through\ndirect experience, which is not up to us.\n\nFor someone who denies that we can voluntarily acquire knowledge\nthrough either conceptualization or assent, Fakhr al-D\u012bn devotes\nsurprising effort to discussing the ways of acquiring assents. He\nintroduces a few substantial innovations in the Avicennan theories of\nthe types of propositions and syllogistics. In fact, Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nintroduces several notions and distinctions that become standard in\nthe subsequent history of Arabic logic. Most of them are rooted in Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s logical apparatus, but Fakhr al-D\u012bn makes\ngreat effort to critically revise and re-organize them, creating the\nfoundations of what has been called \u201crevisionist Avicennan\nlogic\u201d (El-Rouayheb 2019: 68\u201369). One of the most\nimportant innovations is Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s suggestion that Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 failed to distinguish between the alethic and temporal\nunderstanding of necessity. \u201cEvery A is necessarily\nB\u201d does not need to mean the same as \u201cEvery\nA is always B\u201d. With this distinction, Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn creates what Street has called \u201cprofusion of\npropositional types\u201d, which would be extensively discussed in\nthe later period of Arabic logic (Street 2014, 2016; see further\nStrobino & Thom 2016).\n\nAnother important contribution in logic is Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s\ndistinction between two readings of the subject term of a proposition:\nexternalist (kh\u0101rij\u012b) and essentialist\n(\u1e25aq\u012bq\u012b). When we say \u201cEvery A\nis B\u201d on the externalist reading, we mean that every\nsingle thing which actually happens to be A in the real world\nis B. On the essentialist reading, \u201cEvery A is\nB\u201d means \u201ceverything, were it to be described as\nA, would be B\u201d (Mulakhkha\u1e63:\nMan\u1e6diq, 141\u201342). The distinction between the\nexternalist and the essentialist reading is Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s\nresponse to the earlier Arabic discussions of the subject term by\nal-Far\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101. Al-Far\u0101b\u012b was\ncredited with the ampliation of the subject term to the possible. In\nother words, for him, \u201cEvery A is B\u201d\nmeans \u201ceverything that is possibly A, is\nB\u201d. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 was more restrictive:\n\u201cEvery A is B\u201d means \u201ceverything\nthat is actually A, is B\u201d. This need not mean\n\u201ceverything that actually is A in the real\nworld\u201d but can also refer to whatever is actually described\nas A in the mind (Street 2005, 2010, 2014, and 2016, cf.\nChatti 2016). Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s distinction between the\nessentialist and the externalist readings of the subject term may be a\nreaction to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s ampliation of the subject term\nto include the mental realm. As we will see in\n Section 4,\n Fakhr al-D\u012bn denies mental existence, and hence requires\ndifferent formulation for the readings of the subject term that do not\nrefer to real-world actuality.\n3. Physics\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s treatment of the principles of physics\nprovides an illuminating example of his philosophical method. In his\nvarious summae he addresses the same set of issues treated in\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s physics, which are ultimately those already\naddressed by Aristotle\u2019s Physics. Thus we get\nconsiderations of body, motion, time, place, and void. Yet ideas from\nthe kal\u0101m tradition are brought into the mix too, and\nsometimes allowed to prevail. Thus he usually upholds the atomism\nshared by both the Mu\u02bftazilite and Ash\u02bfarite schools of\nkal\u0101m against the continuism of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101. In\nother cases, Fakhr al-D\u012bn seems to be following the lead of\nAb\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b (who was himself an atomist), as he\nembraces a \u201cPlatonic\u201d understanding of time and place,\naccording to which these are independent principles rather than\nmeasurements and limits of bodies and their motions.\n\nThe fundamental distinction in kal\u0101m physics is that\nbetween the atomic substance (jawhar) or \u201cindivisible\npart\u201d, on the one hand, and the accidental properties\n(a\u02bfr\u0101\u1e0d) that belong to these atoms, on the\nother hand (Dhanani 1994, Sabra 2006). As far back as the initial\nreception of Greek philosophy into Arabic, fal\u0101sifa like\nal-Kind\u012b (in a lost work) had rejected atomism in favor of\nAristotelian continuism. This is the view that every part of every\nbody, no matter how small, can in principle be divided into yet\nsmaller sub-parts. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 was also a strong opponent of\natomism (Lettinck 1988, McGinnis 2013, Dhanani 2015), and his\narguments provoked discussion in a number of twelfth century authors\n(see, e.g., McGinnis 2019). Fakhr al-D\u012bn is thus joining a\nlong-running debate when he addresses the cogency of atomism. His\nstatements on the question present a typically confusing picture. He\nseems to reject atomism in his \u201cphilosophical\u201d\n(falsaf\u012b, \u1e25ikm\u012b) works, only to\naccept it in his kal\u0101m works (Zark\u0101n 1963:\n67\u201398). However his late summa, the\nMa\u1e6d\u0101lib, may show that he came to embrace\nkal\u0101m atomism as his own considered view (Dhanani 2015;\nsee also Setia 2004 and 2006, and Baffioni 1982: 211\u201375; for his\nopposition to hylomorphism see Ibrahim 2020).\n\nAs a decisive consideration in favor of atomism he here states that,\nif continuism were true, each body would have an infinity of parts, so\nthat a mustard seed could be \u201cstretched\u201d to coincide with\nthe whole universe (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.6, 71; see Dhanani\n2015: 102 for the passage). Another atomist argument is that if a true\nsphere were to meet a true surface, it would make contact at an\nindivisible point. We can further argue as follows:\n\n\nOnce it is established that the locus of contact is something\nindivisible, the existence of the individual atom must be\nacknowledged. For if we roll a sphere in a full circle on a plane\nsurface, there can be no doubt that as soon as one point of contact\nceases, contact is established with another\n(Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.6, 48\u20139).\n\n\nAs this argument shows, the atoms under consideration here are akin to\ngeometrical points, rather than the very small, extended but\nindivisible bodies proposed in ancient Greek atomism and by the\nearlier Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b. This itself an inheritance\nfrom the kal\u0101m tradition. Geometry was also used by some\nto rebut atomism, so in both the Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib and a\nseparate treatise dedicated to this issue (Alta\u015f 2015), Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn sets out geometrical arguments against atomism and offers\ncounter-refutations.\n\nIf he is indeed an atomist, it would make sense that he should believe\nin the possibility of void, since in both classical and\nkal\u0101m atomism these two doctrines are usually found\ntogether. Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b and Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t\nal-Baghd\u0101d\u012b were also proponents of the void, and both were\ninfluential figures for Fakhr al-D\u012bn. On this topic, he seems to\nbe fairly consistent in upholding the possibility of void against\nAristotelian and Avicennan arguments for its impossibility (Adamson\n2018a). For example, he rejects the Aristotelian argument that, if the\nspeed of motion is inversely proportional to the density of the\nmedium, then motion in a void would be infinitely fast:\n\n\nIf we assume that part of the [required] time is to accommodate the\nmotion in itself, and part of it to accommodate the hindrance, then\nthe motion in pure void will take place in that amount of time that is\nappropriate to the motion as it is in itself. Motion occurring in a\nplenum, meanwhile, will occur in that amount of time plus a further\namount of time, as rendered appropriate by whatever is in the interval\nthat offers [175] hindrance. So it is established that the conclusion\nthey sought to force [on the proponent of void, sc. that motion in a\nvoid would be infinitely fast given the total lack of resistance] does\nnot follow (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.5,\n174.19\u2013175.1).\n\n\nIn other words, the density of the medium only slows the intrinsic\nspeed of the motion that it would have in a vaccuum, which is\nfinite.\n\nVoid is defined either as a case in which two bodies fail to be in\ncontact, with no body between them (Arba\u02bf\u012bn vol.2,\n32) or as a space that has nothing placed within it\n(Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.5, 155). Physical arguments provide\nevidence that void is in fact not just possible but actually occurs,\nas when two flat surfaces are pulled apart: it will take some time,\nhowever minimal, until air rushes in to fill the empty space\n(Arba\u02bf\u012bn vol.2, 35). The second definition of void\njust mentioned brings us to Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s notion of space\nor place, and already suggests his view that place is not dependent on\nbodies, as Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 had claimed (Adamson 2017). For Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, following Aristotle, place is the inner boundary of a\ncontaining body, for example the interior surface of a jug that\nsurrounds the water placed in the jug (Lammer 2018: \u00a75.3). Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn subjects this conception to a barrage of criticisms, for\nexample that a jewel inside a bag would remain in the same\n\u201cplace\u201d even as it is being transported between cities\n(Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.5, 147). Instead, place is for him\nindeed \u201cspace\u201d (fa\u1e0d\u0101\u02be,\n\u1e25ayyiz), which is independent of bodies and may be\neither occupied by a body or not.\n\nWe find a parallel between this idea about space and his account of\ntime (Setia 2008, Adamson 2018b, Adamson & Lammer 2020). For Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 time is a measure of motion (\u02bfAbd\nal-Muta\u02bf\u0101l 2003, McGinnis 2003 and 2008). In the first\ninstance it is the measure of the motion of the outermost heaven,\nsince this is the fastest motion in the cosmos, which accounts for the\napparent diurnal rotation of the fixed stars around the Earth. This,\nfor Fakhr al-D\u012bn, is the \u201cperipatetic\u201d account of\ntime. In his Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib he refutes it and also a\nvariant of the view found in Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t, according to\nwhich time is the measure of existence rather than motion.\nFakhr al-D\u012bn does at least agree that time is real. To establish\nthis he cites an old kal\u0101m idea that time offers a\ncoordination between independent events (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith\nvol.1, 761; Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.5, 47), which is why it is\npossible for me to arrange to meet with you tomorrow (one event) when\nthe sun rises (another event). But time\u2019s existence is not\nsupervenient on motions or cases of existence. Were that the case,\nthen we would have multiple, simultaneous times for the various\nmotions, which would need a superordinate time to coordinate them.\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s discussions of time give us a nice example\nof how his views developed, even while circling around the same set of\narguments (Adamson & Lammer 2020). In the\nMab\u0101\u1e25ith he expresses an an agnostic point of\nview:\n\n\nI have not yet arrived at the realization of the truth about time, so\nlet your expectation from this book be a thorough examination and\nreport of whatever can possibly be said [about time] from all points\nof view (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith vol.1, 761).\n\n\nWhen he writes the Mulakhkha\u1e63, by contrast, he is\ncoming around to the view that beforeness and afterness are\n\u201citems of consideration\u201d (um\u016br\ni\u02bftib\u0101riyya). Yet at the end of his career, he has\nadopted the contrary view. Now he endorses what he says is\nPlato\u2019s view of time: it is \u201ca substance subsisting in\nitself and independent in itself\u201d (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib\nvol.6, 76). The allusion to Plato presumably refers to the\nTimaeus. He is apparently following his fellow philosopher of\nRayy, Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b, both in accepting the\nindependence of time and place and in seeing Plato as an authority for\nthat physical theory (Adamson 2021a: ch.5). One difference between the\ntwo R\u0101z\u012bs, however, is that Fakhr al-D\u012bn makes it clear\nthat time and place are both created by God, and not\n\u201ceternal\u201d principles. Thus his overall account of physics\nenvisions a created spatio-temporal framework within which bodies may,\nbut need not, exist.\n4. Metaphysics\n\nJust as \u201csubstance\u201d (ousia) may rightfully be\ncalled the central notion of Aristotelian metaphysics, so is\n\u201cexistence\u201d (wuj\u016bd) the core notion of\nAvicennan metaphysics. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s metaphysics is a\nstudy of the relationship between different kinds of things and the\nmode of their existence, which ultimately results in identifying a\nspecial, necessary mode of existence, which belongs to one being\nalone, namely God (see, e.g., Bertolacci 2016). There are two core\ndoctrines of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s metaphysics, both widely\ndiscussed after him in the Islamic world, and both addressed by Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn in detail: the distinction between essence and existence,\nand the idea that God is sheer existence, necessary in all\nrespects.\n\n\u201cExistence\u201d refers for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 to the very fact\nthat things are, irrespective of what they are. For instance, it is\none thing for a red apple to be a red apple, and it is a completely\ndifferent thing for the red apple to be. To establish the\ndistinction between what things are (that is, their essence), and\nwhether they are (that is, their existence), Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 uses\nan argument from conceivability. We can conceive of a red apple\nwithout knowing whether it exists, hence its existence must be\ndifferent from its essence (I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t,\nnama\u1e6d 4, 266). But how should we understand this\ndistinction between essence and existence? In the post-Avicennan\ntradition, there are two main answers to this question: the\ndistinction between essence and existence is real\n(\u1e25aq\u012bq\u012b) or it is merely conceptual\n(i\u02bftib\u0101r\u012b). The first answer requires that\nthere are two different items outside the mind, which together make up\nthe existent red apple. The second response means that there is just\none item in the extramental world, the existent red apple; but we can\nanalyse it conceptually into \u201cexistence\u201d and \u201cred\napple\u201d (Wisnovsky 2012, Eichner 2011b).\n\nWithin this debate, Fakhr al-D\u012bn seems to take the realist stance\nthat essence and existence are distinct outside the mind (Benevich\n2017). For instance, he feels compelled to address one of the most\npressing issues for the realists. If essence and existence are\ndistinct in reality, does this mean that all essences are already\nsomehow out there before existence attaches to them? Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nis not puzzled by that difficulty:\n\n\nThe essence as such (min \u1e2bay\u1e6fu hiya hiya) is an\nessence distinct from existence and non-existence. This does not imply\nthe subsistence of something existent in something non-existent\n(Arba\u02bf\u012bn, vol.1, 88).\n\n\nThe essence of the red apple as such (min \u1e25aythu hiya\nhiya) is indeed prior to its existence. The essences of things,\nconsidered as such, are in a different, third state of being, neither\nexistent nor non-existent (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith, vol.1, 129).\nOf course, this does not mean that there are essences of red apples\nhanging around before they even become existent. Just like Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, Fakhr al-D\u012bn accepts that essence and existence\nare extensionally identical: all instances of essence are also\ninstances of existence (Wisnovsky 2012). But Fakhr al-D\u012bn offers\na realist take on the Avicennan distinction by introducing a clear\npriority of essence over existence; more recent interpreters disagree\nas to whether this is faithful to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s own\nmetaphysics (Bertolacci 2012, Benevich 2019b, Janos 2020).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn consistently uses his theory of the priority of\nessence over existence to discuss what Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 considered a\nspecial case, God. In Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s understanding, for Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, God\u2019s essence is just identical to His\nexistence. For Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, this would be the only way to\nguarantee that God exists necessarily. For, if there were any\ncomposition at all of A and B, A could fail\nto be B, and B could fail to attach to A;\nsome further cause would be needed to guarantee the connection between\nthe two. Thus, the only way to secure that A is necessarily\nB is just to say that A is B. That would\nmean that God\u2019s essence is not even conceptually distinct from\nGod\u2019s existence. There is an obvious problem with this doctrine,\nhowever. If God\u2019s essence is sheer existence, but existence also\nbelongs to, for example, a red apple, how is the existence of the red\napple different from the divine essence? Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nreply depends on the notion of the analogy or modulation\n(task\u012bk) of existence, whereby one kind of existence\nbelongs to the red apple and another kind belongs to\u2014or rather,\njust is\u2014God (Treiger 2012, De Haan 2015, Druart 2014,\nZamboni 2020, Janos 2021). But Fakhr al-D\u012bn, again much like Duns\nScotus almost a century later, refuses to take this route. Instead, he\ninsists on the univocity of existence. Everything that exists, does so\nin the same manner of existence. Thus Fakhr al-D\u012bn is also\ncompelled to deny the identity of essence and existence in God\u2019s\ncase. God\u2019s existence will still be necessary, because His\nessence is such that it implies its own existence. So in God essence\nis prior to existence. This priority should not bother or indeed\nsurprise us, since we just have learned that all essences are\nprior to their existence. The upshot is that what is special about God\nis His essence, not a unique kind of existence\n(Mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al, 67; see further Mayer 2003,\nBenevich 2020a).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s contribution to history of metaphysics\nrecalls not only Duns Scotus but also Thomas Aquinas. Like Aquinas, he\noffers a taxonomy of proofs for God\u2019s existence, which becomes\nstandard in philosophy of the Islamic world after him. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn distinguishes between four mains proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence available to him at his time: from the contingency of\nessences; from the temporal origination (\u1e25ud\u016bth)\nof essences; from the contingency of attributes; and from the temporal\norigination of attributes. The first argument may be easily identified\nwith Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof for God\u2019s existence, which\nestablishes the existence of the Necessary Being by reasoning from the\ncontingency of all beings in the world (Marmura 1980; Mayer 2001;\nZarepour 2022). The second argument is the kal\u0101m\ncosmological argument. It argues for the existence of a Creator based\non the fact that the world came to be at some point. The third\nargument, from the contingency of attributes, alludes to the fact that\neverything in the world exists in a certain way, while it could have\neasily been some other way. Therefore, there needs to be some agent\nthat determined how things would exist. Finally, the fourth argument\ncomes closest to what we would designate as a design argument. The\nattributes of things in the world are not just one way when they could\nhave been different, but are in the best way possible. Hence, there\nmust be a wise agent who chose these marvelous features for the world.\nFakhr al-D\u012bn contends that the first argument, that is, Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s argument for the existence of a Necessary Being\nis more fundamental than all other arguments\n(Ma\u02bf\u0101lim, 42).\n\nSo, while disagreeing with Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 whether God\u2019s\nessence and existence are identical, Fakhr al-D\u012bn does accept\nthat God is a Necessary Being. Still, probably due to his\nkal\u0101m allegiances, he is not ready to accept that God is\na necessary being in all respects. For instance, Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s God cannot know particular individuals.\nKnowledge of what is happening right now while you are reading this\narticle would involve a change in God, since He would need to stop\nknowing that you are reading this sentence as soon as you move on to\nthe next one. But if God changes, then He is not necessary in all\nrespects, since necessity implies immutability. So the only way for\nGod to know what happens in the world is to conceive of universal\nrules, laws of nature, and causation, without knowing which of those\nrules are being at work right now (Marmura 2005, Adamson 2005; cf.\nAcar 2004 and Nusseibeh 2009). Following Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t and\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Fakhr al-D\u012bn rejects this line of\nreasoning, on the grounds that change in God\u2019s knowledge is\nmerely relational (Arba\u02bf\u012bn, vol.1, 198). Imagine\nthat you are standing still and something passes by you from right to\nleft; in such a case you do not change, but your relation to that\nmoving thing does change. Now, we need to imagine the same with\nrespect to God\u2019s knowledge the chain of events: it passes by God\nand God observes it, without God essentially changing.\n\nThis account of divine knowledge requires a very specific\nunderstanding of knowledge and cognition. Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nal-R\u0101z\u012b, again following Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t and\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, defines cognition as a relational state\n(\u1e25\u0101la i\u1e0d\u0101fiyya). Fahr al-D\u012bn\nopposes this theory to the representationalist theory of cognition,\ncommonly ascribed to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 at this time:\n\n\nPerception does not just come down to the making of an impression. The\ntruth is rather that it is a relational connective state. For we know\nself-evidently that we have seen Zayd, given that our visual capacity\nfaculty has a certain relation to him. Anyone who claims that the\nobject seen is not Zayd, who exists extramentally and is not seen at\nall, and that the object seen is rather his representation\n(mi\u1e6f\u0101l) and likeness\n(\u0161aba\u1e25), has put into doubt the most important\nand powerful items of necessary knowledge (\u0160ar\u1e25\nal-I\u0161\u0101r\u0101t vol.2, 233).\n\n\nAccording to representationalism, cognition involves the inherence of\nthe cognized object in the object of cognition. For instance, when I\nthink of a red apple, the idea of a red apple must be\n\u201cimprinted\u201d in my mind. For Fakhr al-D\u012bn, cognition\nis a direct relation between the agent of cognition and the object of\ncognition itself, that is, the red apple in itself.\nRepresentations\u2014if there are any\u2014are not the objects of\ncognition (Benevich 2019a, 2020b; Griffel 2021: 341\u201384).\n\nOne may wonder how this theory could explain the cognition of\nnon-existent objects. To what does my mind relate when I think of a\nphoenix, or of a square circle? Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 introduced the\nnotion of mental existence in response to this kind of question. The\nphoenix may fail to be existent outside the mind, but it\nexists in my mind while I am thinking about it, again being imprinted\nin my mind (Black 1997). Just as Fakhr al-D\u012bn rejects the\nrepresentationalist theory of cognition, he consistently rejects the\nAvicennan notion of mental existence (wuj\u016bd\ndhihn\u012b). For him, when I think of non-existent beings, I\njust think of elements that constitute those beings and are observable\nin the world. For instance, thinking of a square circle means thinking\nof a square and a circle as if they were combined (Benevich 2018; on\nthe related issue of the \u201cparadox of the unknown\u201d see\nLameer 2014).\n\nWith this relational theory of cognition in hand, Fakhr al-D\u012bn is\nable to resolve the puzzle of how God knows about changing things.\nObjects of cognition are external to the agent of cognition, so that\nchange in those objects and the subsequent change in the process of\ncognition does not involve any change in the agent. Thus we can say\nthat God is a necessary being, but not necessary in all respects,\nsince His relational cognition of current events is constantly in the\nprocess of change. Yet this implies no change in God\u2019s essence.\nMoreover, we have seen above that Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 suggests that God\nhas knowledge of universal rules of causation and natural laws. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn argues that precisely this kind of knowledge that Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 ascribes to God, that is, the knowledge of universal\nrules and causation, results in knowing every single event in the\nworld at the time when it happens (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.3,\n163\u201364).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s reasoning here presupposes a strictly\ndeterminist account of the world. There is a causal explanation for\neach event, and God knows it. And indeed, Fakhr al-D\u012bn is willing\nto embrace determinism fully. For instance, with respect to human\nactions, he argues that they are determined by the combination of our\nmotivations, beliefs, and capacities. We do not have control over any\nof these (as we saw in Section 1, Fakhr al-D\u012bn insists that our\nbeliefs are not up to us); so we do not have any control over our\nactions either (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.9, 35\u201343).\nThere are two important premises underlying Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s\ndeterminism, both borrowed from Ibn S\u012bn\u0101. One is that there\nmust be, for everything that exists but could have failed to exist,\nsome reason why it exists; this is said to \u201cpreponderate\u201d\nthe thing to exist rather than not existing. Second, when that reason\nis present, the phenomenon must inevitably happen. Therefore, in the\npresence of our capacities and motivations, we have no choice but to\nact, and do so necessarily (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.9,\n21\u201323; Mab\u0101\u1e25ith, vol.2, 517; on\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s theory of action see further Shihadeh\n2006).\n5. Psychology\n\nA fundamental assumption of Aristotelian psychology is that the souls\nof all living things are characterized by a range of\n\u201cpowers\u201d or \u201cfaculties\u201d (Greek\ndunameis, Arabic quwan). These powers account for\nthe distinction between plants, animals, and humans: plants have the\n\u201cvegetative\u201d powers of nutrition, growth, and\nreproduction; animals the powers of sensation, locomotion, and\nimagination; humans alone (among embodied beings) have the power of\nreason or intellect. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 made significant alterations\nto this scheme, not least by introducing a theory of \u201cinternal\nsenses\u201d to account for cognitive capacities lying between\nsensation and full-blown intellection. But broadly speaking, he\nadhered to the tradition of faculty psychology. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn\u2019s earlier contemporary Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t\nal-Baghd\u0101d\u012b rejected this whole approach. For him the soul\nis a unity and is the single subject of all cognition (Kaukua\n2016).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn agrees, and in several of his works offers arguments\nintended to confirm Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t\u2019s thesis. The most\npowerful of these is that the soul is capable of what we might call\n\u201chybrid judgments\u201d. These are modeled on the sort of case\nconsidered already by Aristotle, that honey is both white and sweet:\nhere vision and taste might seem to be making a judgment about the\nsame object, suggesting that they belong to a single subject, which\ncould be the entire soul. Such is Aristotle\u2019s commitment to\nfaculty psychology, though, that he instead introduces a new power\nwithin the soul (the \u201ccommon sense\u201d) to take\nresponsibility for judgments that involve more than one sense\nmodality. Or at least, this is how he was understood in the later\ntradition.\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn argues, however, that the same pattern repeats\nacross all the faculties. For example, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 had drawn a\nstrict contrast between the human intellect and the lower cognitive\nfaculties, on the grounds that the former grasps universals while the\nlatter powers\u2014from sensation to imagination and\nmemory\u2014deal only with particulars. But, says Fakhr al-D\u012bn,\nwe are able to apply a universal to a particular (\u201cZayd is\nhuman\u201d). It must be the unified soul that is responsible for\nsuch judgments:\n\n\nWhen we perceive a particular individual human, we know that he is a\nparticular belonging to the universal \u201chuman\u201d and not a\nparticular belonging to the universal \u201chorse\u201d. That which\njudges a particular man to be a particular belonging to the universal\n\u201chuman\u201d and not a particular belonging to the universal\n\u201chorse\u201d, must inevitably be perceptive of the particular\nman, the universal \u201chuman\u201d, and the universal\n\u201chorse\u201d. And so that which perceives particulars is also\nthat which perceives universals (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith vol.2,\n255; 345\u20136; Shar\u1e25 al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t vol.2,\n265\u20137; the unity of the soul is discussed in depth at\nMa\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.7, 159ff).\n\n\nAnother point, which again is taken over from Ab\u016b\nl-Baghd\u0101d\u012b, is that the human soul at least has a kind of\n\u201cfirst person perspective\u201d on its cognitive actions. It is\ncapable of grasping itself directly\u2014as argued by Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 himself in his famous \u201cflying man\u201d\nargument\u2014and of grasping itself as the subject of all its\ncognitions. Note that, since these arguments all turn on active\ncognition, Fakhr al-D\u012bn is willing to exempt the non-cognitive\nvegetative powers from this unified soul (Mab\u0101\u1e25ith\nvol.2, 256\u20137). But there is no division of powers distinguishing\nthe \u201canimal soul\u201d from the rational soul that is\ndistinctive of humans.\n\nThis does not stop Fakhr al-D\u012bn from using Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s method for proving that the human soul is an\nimmaterial substance (Adamson 2021b, Alpina 2021). Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof inferred the rational soul\u2019s nature\nfrom the nature of its objects: since it grasps indivisible\nintelligible forms, it must itself be indivisible, and therefore not a\nbody. In this case Fakhr al-D\u012bn chooses not to refute the\nAvicennan line of argument but to improve upon it, by adding further\narguments to show that intelligibles are indeed indivisible\n(Mab\u0101\u1e25ith vol.2, 362\u20135, also\nShar\u1e25 vol.2, 285\u20138). He does still worry that the\nargument is incomplete: the rational soul could be indivisible but not\nimmaterial if it were an atom (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.7, 62),\nso the cogency of the argument will depend on showing that atomism is\nincoherent (see above, Section 3). And even if we reject atomism,\nAvicennan prime matter is arguably also indivisible\n(Shar\u1e25 vol.2, 295). Still Fakhr al-D\u012bn seems to be\nat least well-disposed towards the idea that the soul\u2019s ability\nto grasp intelligibles establishes its immateriality.\n\nSince this ability belongs to the entire, unified soul and not is just\none \u201cfaculty\u201d that could exist on its own as a disembodied\nmind, this should secure immateriality, and hence the prospect of\nimmortality, for the human soul. When he speaks about the nature of\nthe human soul, he sometimes says that it is a luminous substance that\nfuses with the body like rosewater in rose petals or oil in sesame,\nwhich seems to make it a kind of very subtle body but not, he says,\nlike those perceptible to the senses (for passages see Jaffer 2015:\n192). But it other contexts, Fakhr al-D\u012bn seems to be ready to\nembrace full-fledged substance dualism. For this conclusion he\ntypically uses argumentation based on introspection, such as his\nversion of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s Flying Man argument, or the\nimmediate awareness of personal identity over time (see, e.g.,\nMa\u1e6d\u0101lib, vol.7, 101; 105).\n\nWhat about animal souls? The arguments presented so far clearly blur\nthe sharp distinction that Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and other\nfal\u0101sifa drew between human and animal souls. But Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn goes further. In both his Mulakhkha\u1e63 and\nhis Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib he suggests that non-human animals\nhave intelligence that is not different in kind from human rationality\n(Adamson & Somma forthcoming, Virgi 2022). Animals are self-aware,\nknow that they persist through time, grasp universals, and can make\nplans and solve problems. This does not necessarily mean that animals\nare equal to humans in their intelligence. Rather there may be a\ncontinuum of cognitive capacities, with some animals ranged further\naway from humans, others closer to them. But\n\n\nif what is meant by \u201creason\u201d is any of the types of\nintelligence, then this intelligence should be attributed to\n[non-human] animals. (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.7, 311)\n\n\nHe may have found this view plausible in part because, again following\nAb\u016b l-Barak\u0101t, he is open to the idea that even just within\nthe human \u201cspecies\u201d we have differences that amount to\ndistinctions in quiddity (Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.7, 141). So\nfrom this point of view too, there is little reason to embrace a stark\nopposition between human and non-human animal nature.\n6. Ethics\n\nOne passage which makes that point is found in his Book on the\nSoul and Spirit (Kit\u0101b al-Nafs wa-l-r\u016b\u1e25\n86\u20137): humans differ so much in their character traits that one\nmay suspect they do not all share the same essence. That exemplifies\nthe approach of this separate treatise, which is to stage a joint\ninquiry into ethics and the soul. One theme addressed here is the\nimprovement of our \u201ccharacter traits\n(akhl\u0101q)\u201d. This is hardly surprising: the\ncentrality of this concept in Arabic moral thinking was such that\nethics itself was referred to as \u02bfilm al-akhl\u0101q\n(literally, \u201cthe science of character traits\u201d). And\nphilosophers both before Fakhr al-D\u012bn, like Miskawayh (d.1040)\nand Ya\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn \u02bfAd\u012b (d.974), and after him, like\nNa\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (d.1274), put\ncharacter traits in both the thematic focus of their writings on\nethics and the titles of those writings. These works are part of a\nbroadly Aristotelian tradition of virtue ethics, which encourages\nreaders to pursue excellent rather than base character. Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 also contributed to this tradition, as in two short\nworks called On Ethics (again, F\u012b l-\u02bfilm\nal-akh\u0101q) and On Governance (F\u012b\nl-Siy\u0101sa; for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019S influence on later\npractical philosophy see Kaya 2014).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn was of course aware of this approach to ethics, and\ntook an interest in the topic of virtue (al-Shaar 2012). But he was no\nAristotelian. Historically, we can say that he responds more to\nkal\u0101m ethics; philosophically, we can say that he was a\nconsequentialist rather than a virtue theorist (for this the essential\nreading is Shihadeh 2006; see also his 2016). Taking the historical\npoint first, as an Ash\u02bfarite he is committed to what would now be\ncalled a \u201cdivine command theory\u201d. That is, the right\naction is whatever is commanded by God, the wrong action is whatever\nis forbidden. The Ash\u02bfarite stance emerged as a critique of the\nMu\u02bftazilite position, which holds that certain types of action\nare known to be wrong without recourse to revelation, for example\nlying. We can always imagine circumstances in which\n\u201cintrinsically wrong\u201d action types turn out to be right\nafter all, like lying to a tyrant to avoid betraying a prophet\n(Arba\u02bf\u012bn vol.1, 348). Therefore this\nMu\u02bftazilite theory is untenable.\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s early works uphold a straightforward divine\ncommand theory. But he comes to pair this with a hedonist and\nconsequentialist ethics, which assumes that pleasure is good for\nhumans and pain bad. To avoid a regress of normative explanation,\nthere must be some fundamental norm, and in Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s\nview hedonism provides that norm. The connection between hedonism and\nAsh\u02bfarite ethics is that God has promised us pleasure if we\nfollow His commands, and pain if we do not. Thus, the divine command\ntheory turns out to be justified on egoistic, consequentialist grounds\n(Shihadeh 2016: 66). This also opens the prospect for determining what\nwe should do in the absence of a divine command: whatever is\n\u201cbeneficial\u201d, in other words pleasure-maximizing for the\nagent. Because pleasure is now so central to his ethical theory, he\ndevotes significant attention to its nature, refuting the originally\nPlatonic \u201crestoration theory\u201d according to which all\npleasure is a return to a natural state from a harmful or painful\nstate (Shar\u1e25 vol.2, 552\u20134). This analysis might\napply to the base pleasures of food or sex, but would not hold for\nhigher pleasures like the grasping of knowledge (see his Epistle\nCensuring the Pleasures of this World, in Shihadeh 2016).\n\nIf we again take his late work, the Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, as\nour best evidence for Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s final philosophical\nviews, then we can infer that he retained his commitment to\nconsequentialism. Characteristically, he itemizes arguments against\nhis own position and refutes them one by one\n(Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib vol.3, 66\u20139). For example, you\nmight encounter an ill person in a wasteland where no one else is\naround to see, and help them. What pleasure are you getting out of\nthis? None, it would seem, yet you would and should do it nonetheless.\nFakhr al-D\u012bn explains that you would be acting on the principle\nthat, if you were in the same position as the unfortunate person, you\nwould want to be treated in the same way. This is not an appeal to\nsome kind of Kantian categorical imperative, but more like what we now\ncall \u201crule utilitarianism\u201d. That is, we should act in such\na way that if people in general acted like this, pleasure would be\nmaximized and pain minimized (for a similar interpretation see\nShihadeh 2016: 80, who emphasizes that the motivation is\n\u201cneither altruistic nor based on a sense of duty\u2026 but is\na self-centred, prudential motivation\u201d).\n\nThis example shows that Fakhr al-D\u012bn was not simply reacting to\nAvicennan falsafa by rehearsing an Ash\u02bfarite\nkal\u0101m view (though he does also refute Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proposal, inspired by Neoplatonism, that evils\nare cases of non-being). He also applied his philosophical acuity to\nreflect on, and modify, the Ash\u02bfarite position. In the later\ntradition he was sometimes accused of adopting skepticism. A\nrepresentative anecdote has him weeping after being disabused of\nsomething he had formerly taken as certain truth and lamenting,\n\u201cwhat is there to prove that all my beliefs are not of this\nnature?\u201d (quoted at Kholeif 1966: 18). The impression of\nskepticism could also be encouraged by his tendency to provide only a\nminimal verdict, or no verdict at all, at the end of a lengthy\ndialectical investigation of some issue. This is something else that\nannoyed later readers: the sheer accumulation of arguments he offered\nfor unacceptable views was dangerous, even if refutations of these\narguments were given thereafter. And it does seem that he saw certain\ndemonstration as being impossible on many theological and\nphilosophical issues. But he was not a global skeptic. As discussed\nabove, he had views about what it would mean to have knowledge, and\nassumed that knowledge is indeed attainable. His massive and still\ninadequately explored corpus testifies to his determination to attain\nthat knowledge like no one else in his time, and thus to supplant Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 as the indispensable thinker of the Islamic world.\n",
