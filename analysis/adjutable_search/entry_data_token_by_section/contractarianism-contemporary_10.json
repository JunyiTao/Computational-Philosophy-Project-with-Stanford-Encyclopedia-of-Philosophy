    "main_text": "The Object of Agreement\n4. The Object of Agreement\n\nSocial contract theories differ about the object of the contract. In\nthe traditional contract theories of Hobbes and Locke, the contract\nwas about the terms of political association. In particular, the\nproblem was the grounds and limits of citizen\u2019s obligation to\nobey the state. In his early formulation, Rawls\u2019s parties\ndeliberated about \u201ccommon practices\u201d (1958). In his later\nstatement of his view, Rawls took the object of agreement to be\nprinciples of justice to regulate \u201cthe basic\nstructure:\u201d\n\nThe basic structure is understood as the way in which the major social\ninstitutions fit together into one system, and how they assign\nfundamental rights and duties and shape the division of advantages\nthat arises through social cooperation. Thus the political\nconstitution, the legally enforced forms of property, and the\norganization of the economy, and the nature of the family, all belong\nto the basic structure. (Rawls 1996, 258)\n\n\nFor Rawls, as for most contemporary contract theorists, the object of\nagreement is not, at least directly, the grounds of political\nobligation, but the principles of justice that regulate the basic\ninstitutions of society. Freeman (2007a: 23), focuses on \u201cthe\nsocial role of norms in public life.\u201d Buchanan is concerned with\njustifying constitutional orders of social and political institutions\n(2000 [1975]). Gauthier (1986), Scanlon (1998), Darwall (2006),\nSouthwood (2010), and Gaus (2011a) employ the contract device to\njustify social moral norms or rules.\n\nThe level at which the object of the contract is described is apt to\naffect the outcome of the agreement. \u201cA striking feature of\nHobbes\u2019 view,\u201d Russell Hardin points out, \u201cis that\nit is a relative assessment of whole states of affairs. Life under one\nform of government versus life under anarchy\u201d (2003, 43). Hobbes\ncould plausibly argue that everyone would agree to the social contract\nbecause \u201clife under government\u201d is, from the perspective\nof everyone, better than \u201clife under anarchy\u201d (the\nbaseline condition). However, if a Hobbesian sought to divide the\ncontract up into, say, more fine-grained agreements about the various\nfunctions of government, she is apt to find that agreement would not\nbe forthcoming on many functions. As we \u201czoom in\u201d (Lister,\n2010) on more fine-grained functions of government, the contract is\napt to become more limited. If the parties are simply considering\nwhether government is better than anarchy, they will opt for just\nabout any government (including, say, one that funds the arts); if\nthey are considering whether to have a government that funds the arts\nor one that doesn\u2019t, it is easy to see how they may not agree on\nthe former. In a similar way, if the parties are deliberating about\nentire moral codes, there may be wide agreement that all the moral\ncodes, overall, are in everyone\u2019s interests; if we \u201czoom\nin\u201d in specific rights and duties, we are apt to get a very\ndifferent answer.\n\nIn multi-level contract theories such as we find in the work of\nBuchanan\u2019s (2000 [1975], Moehler\u2019s (2018), or Thrasher\n(2020), each stage or level has its own unique object. In\nBuchanan\u2019s theory, the object of the constitutional stage is a\nsystem of constraints that will allow individuals to peacefully\nco-exist, what Buchanan calls the \u201cprotective state\u201d (2000\n[1975]). On his view, the state of nature is characterized by both\npredation and defense. One\u2019s ability to engage in productive\nenterprises is decreased because of the need to defend the fruits of\nthose enterprises against those who would rely on predation rather\nthan production. We all have reason to contract, according to\nBuchanan, in order to increase the overall ability of everyone to\nproduce by limiting the need for defense by constraining the ability\nto engage in predation. Once the solution to the predation-production\nconflict has been solved by the constitutional contract, members of\nsociety also realize that if all contributed to the production of\nvarious public goods, the productive possibility of society would be\nsimilarly increased. This second, post-constitutional stage, involves\nwhat Buchanan calls the \u201cproductive state.\u201d Each stage is\nlogically distinct though there are causal relationships between\nchanges made at one stage and the efficacy and stability of the\nsolution at the later stage. The distinction between the two stages is\nanalogous to the traditional distinction between commutative and\ndistributive justice. Although these two are often bound up together\nin contemporary contract theory, one of Buchanan\u2019s novel\ncontributions is to suggest that there are theoretical gains to\nseparating these distinct objects of agreement.\n\nMoehler\u2019s (2017) \u201cmulti-level\u201d contract has several\naspects. First, drawing on their pluralistic moral commitments\nindividuals seek to agree on social-moral rules that all can endorse\nas a common morality. This object of this agreement is similar to that\nof Darwall\u2019s, Gaus\u2019s and Southwood\u2019s models. The\nsecond-level agreement is appropriate to circumstances in which\npluralism is so deep and wide no common morality can be forged. Rather\nthan moral agents, the parties are reconceived as instrumentally\nrational prudential agents: the object of this second level is rules\nof cooperation that advance the interests of all when a deeper moral\nbasis cannot be uncovered.\n",
