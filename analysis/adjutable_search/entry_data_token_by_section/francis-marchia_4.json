    "main_text": "Political and Social Thought\n5. Critical Editions of Texts\n\n The following texts are critical editions, using all known manuscript\nwitnesses. Distinctions 35\u201348 of book I of the\nSentences concern the unified themes of divine knowledge,\npower, and will. Marchia\u2019s Scriptum for book I ends\nprematurely at distinction 40, and distinction 39 on divine ideas is\nmuch truncated. Since distinctions 35\u201340 of the Scriptum have been\npublished (Marchia 1999, 2000, 2001b), the following texts from the\nReportatio for book I, distinctions 39, 42\u201344, and 45\u201348,\ncomplement the Scriptum material on these subjects. Since there are some differences between this text and that in Marchia 2009, the below edition has been retained.\n\n\nFrancis of Marchia,\n Reportatio in primum librum Sententiarum,\nDistinctio 39, 42\u201344, 45\u201348\n\n",
