    "main_text": "Possibilism || Professor Procrastinate\n2.2 Professor Procrastinate\n\nThese views, and their differences, can best be understood by\nconsidering the standard case in the literature, viz. Professor\nProcrastinate. Holly M. Smith (formerly Holly S. Goldman)\nprovides the original version of this case in her (1978:\n185\u2013186) essay, and variations of it appear throughout the\nliterature (Jackson & Pargetter 1986: 235; Carlson 1995: 124;\nVorobej 2000: 131\u2013132; Portmore 2011: 180, 2019: ch. 5;\nTimmerman 2015: 1512; Timmerman & Cohen 2016: 673\u2013674;\nCariani 2016: 400). \n\nProfessor Procrastinate: Professor\nProcrastinate is asked to review a graduate student\u2019s paper,\nsoon to be given as a job talk. Procrastinate can \u27e8agree to\nreview the paper & review the paper\u27e9, which would result in\nthe student receiving a first-rate job offer. Procrastinate can also\n\u27e8agree to review the paper & not review the paper\u27e9,\nwhich would result in the student receiving no job offer. Finally,\nProcrastinate can \u27e8decline to review the paper & not review\nthe paper\u27e9, which would result in the student asking someone\nelse, getting mediocre comments, and receiving a second-rate job\noffer. Now, if Procrastinate were to \u27e8agree to review the\npaper\u27e9, she would later freely \u27e8not review\nit\u27e9.\n\n\nThe value of the act-sets that Procrastinate can perform are ranked\nfrom best to worst as follows.\n\nX. \\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\) agree to review the paper and \\(\\langle b\\rangle\\) review\nthe paper\nY.\n\\(\\langle{\\sim} a\\rangle\\) decline to review the paper and\n\\(\\langle{\\sim}b\\rangle\\) not review the paper\nZ.\\(\\langle\na\\rangle\\) agree to review the paper and \\(\\langle{\\sim}b\\rangle\\)\nnot review the paper\n\n\nFurthermore, Procrastinate would \\(\\langle{\\sim}b\\rangle\\) regardless\nof whether she would \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\). In other words, the\nfollowing counterfactuals are true.\n\n(1)\nIf Procrastinate\nwere to \\(\\langle a\\rangle\\), she would \\(\\langle\nZ\\rangle\\).\n(2)\nIf Procrastinate\nwere to \\(\\langle{\\sim} a\\rangle\\), she would \\(\\langle\nY\\rangle\\).\n\n\nOn a rough definition, according to actualism, Procrastinate is\nobligated to decline to review the paper because what would\nactually happen if she were to decline is better than what\nwould actually happen if she were to agree to review the\npaper. By contrast, according to possibilism, Procrastinate is\nobligated to agree to review the paper because doing so is part of the\nbest series of possible actions that Procrastinate can\nperform over her life. Now that we\u2019ve covered how these views\ngenerally come apart, we will focus on the more precise formulations\nof these views in subsequent sections. It should also be noted that\ncounterfactuals like (1) and (2) are assumed to be true at least\npartly in virtue of Procrastinate\u2019s imperfect moral character.\nHowever, such counterfactuals can also be true as a result of an\nagent\u2019s ignorance, as a result of lacking the dexterity to\nperform an act, and as a result of an agent\u2019s inability to\ncomprehend some future act (Goldman 1978:198; Bykvist 2002: 50). For\nthe purposes of this entry, we will focus on an agent\u2019s\nimperfect moral character since this factor seems to be the driving\nforce behind many points of disagreement between actualists and\npossibilists.\n",
