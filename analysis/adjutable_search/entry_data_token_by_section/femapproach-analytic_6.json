    "main_text": "Characteristics of Analytic Feminism || Style and Aggression\n4.3 Style and Aggression\n\nAlthough arguing explicitly is not to be equated with arguing\naggressively or in an adversarial manner, analytic feminists have\naddressed the issue of stylistic aggressiveness. We must distinguish\ntwo related issues on this subject: first, an aggressive manner of\narguing in general, and second, Janice Moulton\u2019s critique of the\n\u201cadversary method\u201d as a paradigm in philosophy\u2014and\nspecifically in analytic philosophy (1983). Moulton\u2019s point is\nnot simply that the socially constructed belief that aggression is an\nunladylike/unfeminine characteristic puts women at a disadvantage\n(indeed, in a double bind) in careers such as philosophy that equate\naggression with competence. She also focuses on the ways in which the\nuse of the adversary method as a paradigm of philosophy limits and\ndistorts the work of philosophers.\n\nMoulton uses \u201cthe adversary method\u201d to refer to the view\nof philosophy in which the philosopher\u2019s task is to develop\ngeneral claims, produce counterexamples to each other\u2019s general\nclaims, and use only deductive reasoning (1983: 152\u2013153). If\nthis is the paradigm of philosophy rather than simply one strategy\namong many, then the discipline excludes many fruitful kinds of\nexploration and development, distorts the history of philosophy, and\n(because it works best in well-defined areas, even isolated arguments)\ngreatly narrows the scope of philosophical concerns. Moulton also sees\nintegrated into this paradigm several ideals of which she is critical,\nfor example, \u201cvalue-free\u201d reasoning and objectivity.\nInterestingly, she does not draw illustrations from the obvious\nexamples in analytic philosophy such as Edmund Gettier\u2019s\nanalysis of \u201cS knows that p\u201d and the decades\nof responses to it. Instead she uses an early feminist essay, Judith\nThomson\u2019s \u201cA Defense of Abortion\u201d (1971), to show\nways in which important facets of a substantive issue can be set aside\nbecause of restrictions imposed by the adversary method.\n\nI know of no feminist who has argued in print against Moulton\u2019s\nspecific argument opposing the adversary method, although some have\nmade further distinctions (for example, Govier 1999\u00a0and Rooney\n2010). Nevertheless, some analytic feminists have pointed to the value\nof arguing aggressively in general. For example, Louise Antony values\nthe gender transgression and feelings of empowerment and freedom that\ncan stem from a woman\u2019s using an aggressive analytic style of\nwriting and argument (Antony 2003, see also Baber 1993). More recent\ntreatments of aggressive or adversarial styles have arisen in\ndiscussions of the persistently low number of women in philosophy,\ncompared with other humanistic disciplines (see, for example, Burrow\n2010, Rooney 2010, Beebee 2014, and for a differing view that centers\nBlack women, see Henning 2018, 2020). This issue is not one that finds\nanalytic feminists (or any others) in unanimity. Underlying the\ndisagreement over style are important shared goals: to offer clear,\nrational support for feminist positions and to remain respectful of\nthe other person while disagreeing. Feminist philosophers find the\nlatter to be especially important, but peculiarly elusive, when they\nare disagreeing among themselves. The parameters of respectful\ndisagreement have engendered interesting\n debate.[7]\n",
