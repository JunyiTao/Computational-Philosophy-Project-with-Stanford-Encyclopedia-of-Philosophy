    "main_text": "Einstein || General Relativity and Relativity of Motion\n2.4 General Relativity and Relativity of Motion\n\nThere is one key element left out of this success story, however, and\nit is crucial to understanding why most physicists reject\nEinstein\u2019s claim to have eliminated absolute states of motion in\nGTR. Going back to our accelerating rocket, we accepted\nEinstein\u2019s claim that we could regard the ship as hovering at\nrest in a universe-filling gravitational field. But a gravitational\nfield, we usually suppose, is generated by matter. How is this\nuniverse-filling field linked to generating matter? The answer may be\nsupplied by Mach-heavy. Regarding the \u2018accelerating\u2019\nrocket which we decide to regard as \u2018at rest\u2019 in a\ngravitational field, the Machian says: all those stars and galaxies,\netc., jointly accelerating downward (relative to the rocket),\n\u2018produce\u2019 that gravitational field. The mathematical\nspecifics of how this field is generated will have to be different\nfrom Newton\u2019s law of gravity, of course; but it should give\nessentially the same results when applied to low-mass, slow-moving\nproblems such as the orbits of the planets, so as to capture the\nempirical successes of Newtonian gravity. Einstein thought, in 1916 at\nleast, that the field equations of GTR are precisely this mathematical\nreplacement for Newton\u2019s law of gravity, and that they fully\nsatisfied the desiderata of Mach-heavy relationism. But it was not so.\n(See the entry on\n early philosophical interpretations of general relativity.)\n\nIn GTR, spacetime is locally very much like STR\u2019s flat Minkowski\nspacetime. There is no absolute velocity locally, but there are clear\nlocal standards of accelerated vs non-accelerated motion, i.e., local\ninertial frames. In these \u2018freely falling\u2019 frames bodies\nobey the usual rules for non-gravitational physics familiar from STR,\nalbeit only approximately (this is sometimes called the \u2018strong\nequivalence principle\u2019, and is discussed further in section 4\nbelow). But overall spacetime is curved, and local inertial frames may\ntip, bend and twist as we move from one region to another. The\nstructure of curved spacetime is encoded in the metric field tensor\ngab, with the curvature encoding gravity\nat the same time: gravitational forces are so to speak \u2018built\ninto\u2019 the metric field, geometrized away. Since the spacetime\nstructure encodes gravity and inertia, and in a Mach-heavy theory\nthese phenomena should be completely determined by the relational\ndistribution of matter (and relative motions), Einstein wished to see\nthe metric as entirely determined by the distribution of matter and\nenergy. But what the GTR field equations entail is, in general, only a\npartial-determination relation.\n\nWe cannot go into the mathematical details necessary for a full\ndiscussion of the successes and failures of Mach-heavy in the GTR\ncontext. But one can see why the Machian interpretation Einstein hoped\nhe could give to the curved spacetimes of his theory fails to be\nplausible, by considering a few simple \u2018worlds\u2019 permitted\nby GTR. In the first place, for our hovering rocket ship, if we are to\nattribute the gravity field it feels to matter, there has got to\nbe all this other matter in the universe. But if we regard\nthe rocket as a mere \u2018test body\u2019 (not itself substantially\naffecting the gravity present or absent in the universe), then we can\nnote that according to GTR, if we remove all the stars, galaxies,\nplanets etc. from the world, the gravitational field does not\ndisappear. On the contrary, it stays basically the same locally, and\nglobally, in the simplest solution of the field equations, it takes\nthe form of empty Minkowski spacetime \u2013 precisely the\nquasi-absolute structure Einstein was hoping to eliminate. Solutions\nof the GTR field equations for arbitrary realistic configurations of\nmatter (e.g., a rocket ship ejecting a stream of particles to push\nitself forward) are hard to come by, and in fact a realistic two-body\nexact solution has yet to be discovered. But numerical methods can be\napplied for many purposes, and physicists do not doubt that something\nlike our accelerating rocket \u2013 in otherwise empty space \u2013\nis possible according to the\n theory.[7]\n We see clearly, then, that GTR fails to satisfy Einstein\u2019s own\nunderstanding of Mach\u2019s Principle, according to which, in the\nabsence of matter, space itself should not be able to exist.\n\nA second example: GTR allows us to model a single rotating\nobject in an otherwise empty universe (e.g., a neutron star).\nRelationism of the Machian variety says that such rotation is\nimpossible, since it can only be understood as rotation relative to\nsome sort of absolute space. In the case of GTR, this is indeed the\nnatural way to understand such a model: the rotation is best\nunderstood as rotation relative to a \u2018background\u2019\nspacetime that is identical to the Minkowski spacetime of STR, only\n\u2018curved\u2019 by the presence of matter in the region of the\nstar.\n\nOn the other hand, there is one charge of failure-to-relativize-motion\nsometimes leveled at GTR that is unfair. It is sometimes asserted that\nthe simple fact that the metric field (or the connection it\ndetermines) distinguishes, at every location, motions that are\n\u2018absolutely\u2019 accelerated and/or \u2018absolutely\nrotating\u2019 from those that are not, by itself entails that GTR\nfails to embody a folk-Leibniz style general relativity of motion\n(e.g. Earman (1989), ch. 5). We think this is incorrect, and leads to\nunfairly harsh judgments about confusion on Einstein\u2019s part. The\nlocal inertial structure encoded in the metric would not be\n\u2018absolute\u2019 in any meaningful sense, if that structure were\nin some clear sense fully determined by the relationally specified\nmatter-energy distribution. Einstein was not simply confused\nwhen he named his gravity theory. (Just what is to be understood by\n\u201cthe relationally specified matter-energy distribution\u201d is\na further, thorny issue, which we cannot enter into here.)\n\nGTR does not fulfill all the goals of Mach-heavy, at least as\nunderstood by Einstein, and he recognized this fact by 1918 (Einstein\n1918). And yet \u2026 GTR comes tantalizingly close to achieving\nthose goals, in certain striking ways (cf. Hoefer 2014). For one\nthing, GTR does predict Mach-heavy effects, known as\n\u2018frame-dragging\u2019: if we could model Mach\u2019s\nthick-walled bucket in GTR, it seems clear that it would pull the\nwater slightly outward, and give it a slight tendency to begin\nrotating in the same sense as the bucket (even if the big\nbucket\u2019s walls were not actually touching the water). While GTR\ndoes permit us to model a lone rotating object, if we model the object\nas a shell of mass (instead of a solid sphere) and let the size of the\nshell increase (to model the \u2018sphere of the fixed stars\u2019\nwe see around us), then as Brill & Cohen (1966) showed, the\nframe-dragging becomes complete inside the shell. In other words: our\noriginal Minkowski background structure effectively disappears, and\ninertia becomes wholly determined by the shell of matter, just as Mach\nposited was the case. This complete determination of inertia by the\nglobal matter distribution appears to be a feature of other models,\nincluding the Friedman-Lem\u00e2itre-Robertson-Walker Big Bang models\nthat best match observations of our universe.\n\nFinally, it is important to recognize that GTR is generally covariant\nin a very special sense: unlike all other prior theories (and unlike\nmany subsequent quantum theories), it postulates no fixed\n\u2018prior\u2019 or \u2018background\u2019 spacetime structure.\nAs mathematicians and physicists realized early on, other theories,\ne.g., Newtonian mechanics and STR, can be put into a generally\ncovariant form. But when this is done, there are inevitably\nmathematical objects postulated as part of the formalism, whose role\nis to represent absolute elements of spacetime structure (see Friedman\n1983, Pooley 2017). What is unique about GTR is that it was the first,\nand is still the only \u2018core\u2019 physical theory, to have no\nsuch absolute elements in its covariant equations. (Whether these\nclaims are exactly correct is a matter of ongoing debate, relating to\nthe question of the \u2018background independence\u2019 of GTR: for\ndiscussion, see e.g. Belot (2011), Pitts (2006), Read (2016), and\nPooley (2017).) The spacetime structure in GTR, represented by the\nmetric field, is at least partly \u2018shaped\u2019 by the\ndistribution of matter and energy. And in certain models of the\ntheory, such as the Big Bang cosmological models, some authors have\nclaimed that the local standards of inertial motion \u2013 the local\n\u2018gravitational field\u2019 of Einstein\u2019s equivalence\nprinciple \u2013 are entirely fixed by the matter distribution\nthroughout space and time, just as Mach-heavy requires (see, for\nexample, Wheeler and Cuifollini 1995).\n\nAbsolutists and relationists are thus left in a frustrating and\nperplexing quandary by GTR. Considering its anti-Machian models, we\nare inclined to say that motions such as rotation and acceleration\nremain absolute, or nearly-totally-absolute, according to the theory.\nOn the other hand, considering its most Mach-friendly models, which\ninclude all the models taken to be good candidates for representing\nthe actual universe, we may be inclined to say: motion in our\nworld is entirely relative; the inertial effects normally used to\nargue for absolute motion are all understandable as effects of\nrotations and accelerations relative to the cosmic matter, just as\nMach hoped. But even if we agree that motions in our world are in fact\nall relative in this sense, this does not automatically settle the\ntraditional relationist/absolutist debate, much less the\nrelationist/substantivalist debate. Many philosophers (including, we\nsuspect, Nerlich 1994 and Earman 1989) would be happy to acknowledge\nthe Mach-friendly status of our spacetime, and argue nevertheless that\nwe should understand that spacetime as a real thing, more like a\nsubstance than a mere ideal construct of the mind as Leibniz insisted.\nBy contrast, other philosophers (e.g., Rynasiewicz 1995) argue that\ndue to the conceptual and mathematical novelties introduced in GTR,\nthe traditional absolute vs. relational motion debate simply fails to\nmake sense any more (on this question, see also Hoefer 1998).\n",
