    "main_text": "Tillers and Soldiers: Ruling the People || Punishments\n3.1 Punishments\n\nShang Yang gained notoriety as a people-basher. The text attributed to\nhim indeed appalls the readers with provocative pronouncements, such\nas \u201cWhen the people are weak, the state is strong. Hence the\nstate that possesses the Way devotes itself to weakening the\npeople\u201d (Book of Lord Shang 20.1, \u201cWeakening the\npeople\u201d). Elsewhere, the author insists that to succeed in his\nundertakings, the ruler should \u201ccontrol the people as the\nmetalworker controls metal and the potter clay... Those who excel at\norderly rule block the people with law; then a [good] name and lands\ncan be attained.\u201d (Book of Lord Shang 18.2,\n\u201cCharting the policies\u201d). Similar pronouncements permeate\nthe text.\n\nNo other thinker matches Shang Yang\u2019s brazennes in exposing the\nperennial contradiction between society (\u201cthe people\u201d) and\nthe state. In the age when the people are \u201cknowledgeable and\ncrafty,\u201d coercion is the only mean to rein them in. This\nexplains the pivotal role of the punitive system in Shang Yang\u2019s\nmodel. Harsh punishments should be imposed even on minor or even\n\u201cabout to be committed\u201d transgressions. The system of\nmutual responsibility among neighbors and kin, tight residential\ncontrol, and mandatory denouncement of crimes would ensure that every\ncriminal is apprehended. Yet once the populace is overawed, the\npunishments become redundant:\n\n\nTo prevent wrongdoing and stop transgressions, nothing is better than\nmaking punishments heavy. When punishments are heavy and [criminals]\nare inevitably captured, then the people dare not try [to break the\nlaw]. Hence, there are no penalized people in the state. When there\nare no penalized people in the state, it is said, then:\n\u201cClarifying punishments [means] no executions.\u201d (Book\nof Lord Shang 17.3, \u201cRewards and punishments\u201d)\n\n\nHarshness is essential for the system\u2019s success, but so is the\nlaws\u2019 transparency and fairness (above, section 2.3). The\nultimate goal is to \u201ceradicate punishments with\npunishments\u201d (Book of Lord Shang 18.1, \u201cCharting\nthe policies\u201d). To a certain degree, this goal was achieved.\nActually, even such critics of Shang Yang as Sima Qian acknowledged\nhis success in turning the Qin people into law-abiding subjects\n(Shiji 68: 2231).\n",
