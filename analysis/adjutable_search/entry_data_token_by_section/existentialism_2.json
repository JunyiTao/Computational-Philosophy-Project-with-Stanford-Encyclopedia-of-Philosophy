    "main_text": "Engagement vs. Detachment || Subjective Truth\n2.1 Subjective Truth\nThe existentialist critique of theoretical detachment was pioneered\nby Kierkegaard whose scorn was directed primarily at G.W. F. Hegel, a\nphilosopher who adopted the \u201cperspective of eternity\u201d to\nbuild a metaphysical system that would provide complete knowledge of\nreality. By taking a disengaged and panoptic view, Kierkegaard argues\nHegel\u2019s system invariably covers over the deeply personal project\nof being human and the specific needs and concerns of the existing\nindividual. In his words, \u201cit makes the subject accidental, and\nthereby transforms existence into something indifferent, something\nvanishing\u201d (1846 [1941, 173]). In response, Kierkegaard reverses\nthe traditional orientation that privileges objectivity by claiming\nthat, when it comes to the question of existence, one\u2019s own\nsubjective truth is \u201cthe highest truth attainable\u201d\n(1846 [1941, 182]). This means the abstract truths of philosophical\ndetachment are always subordinate to the concrete truths of the\nexisting individual. \u201cThe real subject,\u201d writes\nKierkegaard, \u201cis not the cognitive subject \u2026 the real\nsubject is the ethically existing subject\u201d (1846 [1941, 281]). And\nsubjective truth cannot be reasoned about or explained logically; it\nemerges out of the situated commitments, affects, and needs of the\nindividual. For this reason, it does not disclose timeless and\nobjective truths; it discloses \u201ca truth which is true for\nme\u201d (1835 [1959, 44]). For Kierkegaard, to live this truth\ninvariably results in feelings of anxiety and confusion because it is\nobjectively uncertain; it has no rational justification, and no one\nelse can understand or relate to it. It is an ineffable truth that is\nfelt rather than known. In this sense, the existing individual\n\u201cdiscovers something that thought cannot think\u201d\n(Kierkegaard 1844 [1936, 29]). But prioritizing the contingent and\nunrationalizable truths of existence does not mean Kierkegaard is\nforwarding a position of \u201cirrationalism.\u201d He is claiming,\nrather, that the standpoint of rational detachment cannot help us\naccess the self-defining commitments and projects that matter to the\nexisting individual. Truths of flesh and blood cannot be reduced to\nsystematic explanation because such truths do not provide us with\nobjective knowledge. Rather, they lay bare the passionate and urgent\nsense of how we should live our lives. They tell the individual:\n\u201cwhat I am to do, not what I am to know\u201d\n(Kierkegaard, 1835 [1959, 44]).\n",
