    "main_text": "The Early Modern Reception of Locke\u2019s Picture of Persons\n4. Locke\u2019s Lasting Impact on the Personal Identity Debate\n\nThis section briefly outlines the lasting impact that Locke has had on\nthe debate over persons and their persistence conditions by exploring\nhow Locke\u2019s theory of personal identity gets taken up in the\ntwentieth and twenty-first centuries. Most metaphysicians contributing\nto the debate over personal identity refer to Locke\u2019s treatment\nof persons in their texts. Many even directly respond to\nLocke\u2019s view as they flesh out their own.\n\nMost who hold psychological continuity theories of personal identity\ntake their views to be descendants of Locke\u2019s. This is true of\nJohn Perry (1975), David Lewis (1976), Sydney Shoemaker (1984), and\nDerek Parfit (1984), for instance (Schechtman \u201cMemory, Identity,\nand Sameness of Consciousness\u201d, forthcoming in The Lockean\nMind). In fact, Parfit defends what he calls a \u201cLockean\nview\u201d as recently as 2016 (34). What makes each of these views\nLockean (at least according to their authors) is that, as\nLocke does, they take personal identity to consist in the continuity\nof psychological life, and they take this to mean that personal\nidentity is relational. Moreover, like Locke, they emphasize the\nforensic nature of personhood.\n\nMarya Schechtman offers a rival interpretation to those held by Perry,\nLewis, Shoemaker, and Parfit, but Locke is very much in the foreground\nof Schechtman\u2019s narrative account as well. In The\nConstitution of Selves (1996: 15), Schechtman claims, \n\n\nThe argument that personal identity must be defined in psychological\nterms is first systematically presented and defended by Locke in his\nEssay concerning Human Understanding \n\n\nSchechtman then goes on to show that the project of psychological\ncontinuity theorists is \u201cincoherent\u201d because \n\n\n[t]he goal of offering reidentification criterion is fundamentally at\nodds with the goal of defining personal identity in terms of\npsychological continuity\u2026. (1996: 24) \n\n\nImportantly, Schechtman does this not just by making a passing\nreference to Locke and then treating Parfit, Perry, and the like, but\nvia a thorough examination of Locke\u2019s theory, and the objections\nraised to it by Butler, Reid, and others.\n\nMoreover, this is the case not only in Schechtman\u2019s earlier\nwork, but in her most recent work as well. Schechtman includes a\nthirty-two page chapter titled, \u201cLocke and the Psychological\nContinuity Theorists\u201d at the start of Staying Alive:\nPersonal Identity, Practical Concerns, and the Unity of a Life\n(2014), and in \u201cMemory, Identity, and Sameness of\nConsciousness\u201d, Schechtman turns to recent developments in the\npsychological study of memory to update Locke\u2019s view to\n\u201c\u2026capture some of the crucial insights of Locke\u2019s\naccount, and show why it remains relevant and influential\u201d (in\nThe Lockean Mind, forthcoming).\n\nThose who defend animalism\u2014or the view that persons just are\nhuman organisms\u2014hold a position that is quite different from\npsychological continuity theories or narrative based views. Still,\nmost animalists respond to Locke. Some even invoke Locke\u2019s view\nas they develop their own. For example, Eric Olson\u2019s animalist\nview relies very heavily both on Locke\u2019s conception of\n\u201clife\u201d, and the persistence conditions Locke gives for\norganisms (1997: 137\u2013138, etc.). This is why Olson describes his\nview as \u201cLockean\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, some animalists blame Locke for separating the\ndiscussion of persons and personal identity from the discussion of\nhuman beings or human animals. In Animalism: New Essays on\nPersons, Animals & Identity, Stephen Blatti and Paul Snowdon\nask, \u201cWhy was the idea of an animal conspicuously\nabsent\u2026\u201d in the personal identity debate for so long\n(2016: 3)? They go on,\n\n\nTo answer this question, we need to return to Locke\u2019s famous\ndiscussion of personal identity, in which the notion of an animal was\ncentral\u2026Locke exercised great care in specifying the different\nideas for which the words \u2018animal\u2019 and\n\u2018person\u2019 stood. A reasonable conjecture, or proposal, we\nsuggest, is that Locke\u2019s treatment of these two terms and\nnotions was so effective that it generated in people engaging with the\nproblem the conviction that the notion of a person is the central one\nfixing the type of thing the problem is about, with the consequence\nthat the notion of an animal was lost to sight. (2016: 3) \n\n\nLocke does much to distinguish between human beings (or\nmen)\u2014which are animals\u2014and persons, and Blatti and Snowdon\nassert that this sets the stage for how the personal identity debate\nplays out for the next several hundred years. In other words, Locke is\nthe reason that animalist views do not emerge until later in the\ntwentieth\n century.[16]\n\nFinally, even those working to carve out an entirely new space for the\ndiscussion of persons and their persistence conditions say something\nabout Locke as they proceed. Leke Adeofe outlines and develops a\ntripartite picture of persons according to what he calls the\n\u201cAfrican thought system\u201d. As he does, Adeofe aligns his\napproach with Locke\u2019s. He says, \n\n\nMy approach, partly descriptive and partly imaginative, ought to be\nfamiliar; it has been borrowed from a tradition that dates back at\nleast to John Locke. (2004: 69) \n\n\nMoreover, this is the case even though Adeofe uses the African, or\nYoruba, conception of \u201cperson\u201d to challenge Western\nphilosophy\u2019s treatment of persons and their persistence\nconditions.\n\nIn Real People: Personal Identity Without Thought Experiments\n(1988), Kathleen Wilkes takes aim at the proliferation of thought\nexperiments in the personal identity literature. It is clear that\nWilkes has the elaborate thought experiments that Parfit employs\n(including teletransportation, split brain cases, etc.) in mind\nthroughout her critique. But, it is also clear that Wilkes traces this\nmethodology back to Locke. Of this she says, \n\n\nThe subject of personal identity\u2026has probably exploited the\nmethod [of thought experiments] more than any other problem area in\nphilosophy. Many of the examples are familiar:\u2026Locke testing\n\u2018what we would say if\u2019 the soul of a cobbler migrated into\nthe body of a prince, or if the Mayor of Queinborough awoke one day\nwith all of Socrates\u2019 memories. (Wilkes 1988: 6) \n\n\nThe \u201cprince and the cobbler\u201d passage, or L-N 2.27.15,\nproceeds in the opposite direction, with Locke asking us what we would\nconclude about the soul of a prince entering and informing the body of\na cobbler, but, regardless, Wilkes takes Locke and the tradition that\nfollows, as her target as she works to move the discussion of personal\nidentity away from fantasy cases and toward real-life ones.\n\nLocke\u2019s discussion of personal identity is central to the\ncurrent debate over persons and their persistence conditions.\nNevertheless, there are many different versions of Locke\u2019s view\nthat contemporary metaphysicians take themselves to be embracing or\nrejecting. Even those who describe their respective views as\n\u201cLockean\u201d\u2014Parfit and Olson, for instance\u2014can\nend up defending very different pictures of persons. This highlights\njust how difficult it is to determine what Locke\u2019s view on\npersons and their persistence conditions amounts to, despite how clear\nits importance is.\n",
