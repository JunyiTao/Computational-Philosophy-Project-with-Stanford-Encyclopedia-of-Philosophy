    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nFranz Brentano was born on January 16, 1838 in Marienberg am Rhein,\nGermany, a descendent of a strongly religious German-Italian family of\nintellectuals (his uncle Clemens Brentano and his aunt Bettina von\nArnim were among the most important writers of German Romanticism and\nhis brother Lujo Brentano became a leading expert in social\neconomics). He studied mathematics, poetry, philosophy, and theology\nin Munich, W\u00fcrzburg, and Berlin. Already at high school he became\nacquainted with Scholasticism; at university he studied Aristotle with\nTrendelenburg in Berlin, and read Comte as well as the British\nEmpiricists (mainly John Stuart Mill), all of whom had a great\ninfluence on his work. Brentano received his Ph.D. from the University\nof T\u00fcbingen in 1862, with his thesis On the Several Senses of\nBeing in Aristotle.\n\nAfter graduation Brentano prepared to take his vows; he was ordained a\nCatholic priest in 1864. Nevertheless he continued his academic career\nat the University of W\u00fcrzburg, where he presented his\nHabilitationsschrift on The Psychology of Aristotle\nin 1867. Despite reservations in the faculty about his priesthood he\neventually became full professor in 1873. During this period, however,\nBrentano struggled more and more with the official doctrine of the\nCatholic Church, especially with the dogma of papal infallibility,\npromulgated at the first Vatican Council in 1870. Shortly after his\npromotion at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Brentano withdrew from\nthe priesthood and from his position as professor.\n\nAfter his Habilitation, Brentano had started to work on a\nlarge scale work on the foundations of psychology, which he entitled\nPsychology from an Empirical Standpoint. The first volume was\npublished in 1874, a second volume (The Classification of Mental\nPhenomena) followed in 1911, and fragments of the third volume\n(Sensory and Noetic Consciousness) were published\nposthumously by Oskar Kraus in 1928.\n\nShortly after the publication of the first volume, Brentano took a job\nas a full professor at the University of Vienna, where he continued a\nsuccessful teaching career. During his tenure in Vienna, Brentano, who\nwas very critical towards his own writing, did not pursue his plans to\ncomplete and publish the second and third volumes of his\nPsychology, but preferred to publish shorter texts, most of\nwhich were based on manuscripts for public lectures. The topics range\nfrom aesthetics (Das Genie [The Genius], Das Schlechte\nals Gegenstand dichterischer Darstellung [Evil as Object of\nPoetic Representation]) and issues in historiography to The Origin\nof the Knowledge of Right and Wrong, in which Brentano laid out\nhis views on ethics. The latter was Brentano\u2019s first book to be\ntranslated into English in 1902. \n\nWhen in 1880 Brentano and Ida von Lieben decided to wed, they had to\nconfront the fact that the prevailing law in the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire denied matrimony to persons who had been ordained priests\n\u2013 even if they later had resigned from priesthood. They\nsurmounted this obstacle by temporarily moving to and becoming\ncitizens of Saxony, where they finally got married. This was possible\nonly by temporarily giving up the Austrian citizenship and, in\nconsequence, the job as full professor at the University. When\nBrentano came back to Vienna a few months later, the Austrian\nauthorities did not reassign him his position. Brentano became\nPrivatdozent, a status that allowed him to go on teaching\n\u2013 but did not entitle him to receive a salary or to supervise\ntheses. For several years he tried in vain to get his position back.\nIn 1895, after the death of his wife, he left Austria disappointed; at\nthis occasion, he published a series of three articles in the Viennese\nnewspaper Die neue freie Presse entitled Meine letzen\nW\u00fcnsche f\u00fcr \u00d6sterreich [My Last Wishes for\nAustria] (which soon afterwards appeared as a self-standing book), in\nwhich he outlined his philosophical position as well as his approach\nto psychology, but also harshly criticized the legal situation of\nformer priests in Austria. In 1896 he settled down in Florence where\nhe got married to Emilie Ruprecht in 1897.\n\nBrentano has often been described as an extraordinarily charismatic\nteacher. Throughout his life he influenced a great number of students,\nmany of who became important philosophers and psychologists in their\nown rights, such as Edmund Husserl, Alexius Meinong, Christian von\nEhrenfels, Anton Marty, Carl Stumpf, Kasimir Twardowski, as well as\nSigmund Freud. Many of his students became professors in different\nparts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Marty and Ehrenfels in Prague,\nMeinong in Graz, and Twardowski in Lvov (now Lviv), and so spread\nBrentanianism over the whole Austro-Hungarian Empire, which explains\nthe central role of Brentano in the philosophical development in\ncentral Europe, especially in what was later called the Austrian\nTradition in philosophy.\n\nBrentano always emphasized that he meant to teach his students to\nthink critically and in a scientific manner, without holding\nprejudices and paying undue respect to philosophical schools or\ntraditions. When former students of his took a critical approach to\nhis own work, however, when they criticized some of his doctrines and\nmodified others to adapt them for their own goals, Brentano reacted\nbitterly. He often refused to discuss criticism, ignored improvements,\nand thus became more and more isolated, a development that was\nreinforced by his increasing blindness.\n\nDue to these eye-problems Brentano could not read or write any longer,\nbut had his wife read to him and dictated his work to her.\nNonetheless, he produced a number of books in his years in Florence.\nIn 1907 he published Untersuchungen zur Sinnespsychologie, a\ncollection of shorter texts on psychology. In 1911 he presented not\nonly the second volume of his Psychology from an Empirical\nStandpoint, but also two books on Aristotle: in Aristotle and\nhis World View he provides an outline and interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy. In Aristoteles Lehre vom Ursprung\ndes menschlichen Geistes Brentano continues a debate with Zeller.\nThis debate had started already in the 1860s, when Brentano criticized\nZeller\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle in his Psychology of\nAristotle and became quite intense and aggressive in the\nseventies and eighties of the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen Italy entered war against Germany and Austria during World War I,\nBrentano, who felt himself a citizen of all three countries, moved\nfrom Florence to neutral Switzerland. He passed away in Zurich on\nMarch 17, 1917.\n\nBrentano left a huge number of unpublished manuscripts, including\npoetry and letters on a wide range of philosophical topics in his last\ndomicile in Z\u00fcrich and in his summer-residence in\nSch\u00f6nb\u00fchel bei Melk; some manuscripts were probably left\nbehind in Florence. After his death, Alfred Kastil and Oskar Kraus, who\nwere students of Brentano\u2019s former student Anton Marty in\nPrague, worked on the Nachlass, transferring a good part of it\nto Innsbruck. Their attempt to set up a Brentano-archive was supported\nby Tomas Masaryk, a former student of Brentano who had become founder\nand first President (from 1918 to 1935) of the Republic of\nCzechoslovakia. As a result, in 1932 many of the original manuscripts\nwere moved to Prague where an archive was founded. Alas, due to the\npolitical turbulences that were to came over central Europe the\nproject made it necessary to transfer the archive again. Substantial\nparts of the Nachlass were transferred to different places in\nthe United States, some of it has later been brought back to Europe,\nespecially to the Brentano-Forschungsstelle at the University of Graz,\nAustria, and the Brentano family archive in Blonay, Switzerland. (For\na detailed history of Brentano\u2019s Nachlass, cf. Binder\n(2013)). \n\nKastil and Kraus did succeed, however, to begin to publish\nposthumously some of the lecture notes, letters, and drafts he had\nleft. They tried to present Brentano\u2019s work as best as they\ncould, putting together various texts to what they thought were\nrounded, convincing works, sometimes following questionable editorial\ncriteria. Their work was continued by other, more careful editors, but\nhas by far not yet been completed: a much needed critical edition of\nhis complete \u0153uvre is still to be waited for.\n",
