    "main_text": "Work || The 1480s and 1490s\n2.4 The 1480s and 1490s\n\n\nAs time went by, Ficino\u2019s intellectual energies moved in the direction\nof deepening his understanding of Platonism and of expanding this\nproject of cultural translation. Having translated and explicated much\nof Plato\u2019s work, he shifted, in the late 1480s, to Plotinus, an\nexegetical project that included the first full Greek to Latin\ntranslation of Plotinus\u2019s works along with commentary. \n\nIn 1489, Ficino published a work, Three Books on Life (De\nvita libri tres), that had a substantial printing history in\nearly modern Europe, even as its contents contributed to his later\nreputation as a less-than-serious philosopher (see Kaske and\nClark; and Robichaud 2017a). The manuscript tradition prior to its printing tells the story\nof a work composed of three separate books: \u2018On Healthy\nLife\u2019 (De vita sana), completed around 1480,\ncorresponded to Book One in the eventual printed edition. An amalgam\nof folk medicine and learned commentary, De vita sana was\nintended to help scholars, thought to have a \u201cmelancholic\u201d\nhumoral temperament, achieve a healthy style of life.  Toward that\nend, it counseled various recipes, dietary regimes, and personal\nhabits, all to be undertaken under the umbrella of what were\nconsidered proper astrological conditions. The second book, \u2018On\nLong Life\u2019 (De vita longa), completed in 1489, was\nwritten in a similar vein and directed to the aged. Finally, the third\nbook, \u2018On Obtaining Life from the Heavens\u2019 (De vita\ncoelitus comparanda), composed sometime between the first two\nbooks, grew out of Ficino\u2019s commentary project on Plotinus (it was\nspecifically a commentary on Enneads, 4.3.11).\nOf the three books of De vita, the third proved most\ncontroversial, dealing as it did in places with seemingly heretical\nthemes, including potentially idolatrous \u201cstatue\nanimation\u201d, which is to say the possibility of drawing down\ncelestial forces into inanimate objects, thus rendering them\nanimate. For Ficino, the ritualized activation of occult properties\n(\u201csigned\u201d images and \u201csympathies\u201d) represented a legitimate part of\nnatural philosophy, one to which the recently available range of later\nPlatonic and \u201cHermetic\u201d material had opened new pathways. Ficino tells\n(to take one typical example) of certain stars that possess discrete\npowers (Ficino in Kaske and Clark, 3.8, 278-79). He reports that\nThebit, an ancient thinker known from the Hermetic Corpus,\n\u201cteaches that, in order to capture the power of any of the stars just\nmentioned, one should take its stone and herb and make a gold or\nsilver ring and should insert the stone with the herb underneath it\nand wear it touching [your flesh]\u201d (ibid., tr. Kaske and\nClark). Channeling powers that the divine had implanted in nature for\nhumankind to use could indeed seem legitimate. Yet Ficino came close\nenough to theological unacceptability that the publication\nof Three Books on Life signaled the only time, seemingly,\nthat his work drew negative attention from Church authorities. What\nprecisely happened is vague, but a substantial correspondence after\nMay, 1490, in which Ficino asked certain friends of his at the court\nof Pope Innocent VIII for help, suggests that certain people had\ncalled his orthodoxy into question (Kristeller 1956-96,\n4:265-76).  By August of that year, Ficino was assured that his\nreputation was favorable at the Papal Court.\nThe year 1496 saw the publication of an expanded version of\nsome Commentaries on Plato, including\nthe Parmenides, Sophist, Philebus,\nTimaeus, Phaedrus, and the \u201cnuptial\nnumber\u201d in the Republic (Allen 1994). In 1497 Ficino\npublished, with Aldus Manutius, a volume devoted to other\n\u201cPlatonic\u201d authors, with works by Iamblichus, Proclus,\nPorphyry, Synesius, and Psellus making appearances.\n",
