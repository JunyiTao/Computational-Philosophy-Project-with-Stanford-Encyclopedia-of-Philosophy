    "main_text": "Examples of Psychologistic Reasoning\n3. Examples of Psychologistic Reasoning\n\nAlthough the exact definition of \u2018psychologism\u2019 was itself\npart and parcel of the Psychologismus-Streit, most\nGerman-speaking philosophers, from the 1880s onwards, agreed that the\nfollowing arguments deserved the label \u2018psychologistic\u2019 (I\nshall write PA for \u2018psychologistic\nargument\u2019):\n\n(PA\u00a01)\n1. Psychology is defined as the science which studies\nall (kinds of) laws of thought.\n\n2. Logic is a field of inquiry which studies a subset of all\nlaws of thought.\n\nErgo, logic is a part of psychology. \n(PA\u00a02)\n1. Normative-prescriptive disciplines \u2014 disciplines that\ntell us what we ought to do \u2014 must be based upon\ndescriptive-explanatory sciences.\n\n2. Logic is a normative-prescriptive discipline concerning human\nthinking.\n\n3. There is only one science which qualifies as constituting the\ndescriptive-explanatory foundation for logic: empirical psychology.\n\nErgo, logic must be based upon psychology. \n(PA\u00a03)\n1. Logic is the theory of judgments, concepts, and inferences.\n\n2. Judgments, concepts, and inferences are human mental entities.\n\n3. All human mental entities fall within the domain of psychology.\n\nErgo, logic is a part of psychology. \n(PA\u00a04)\n1. The touchstone of logical truth is the feeling of\nself-evidence.\n\n2. The feeling of self-evidence is a human mental experience.\n\nErgo, logic is about a human mental experience \u2014 and\nthus a part of psychology. \n(PA\u00a05)\n1. We cannot conceive of alternative logics.\n\n2. The limits of conceivability are mental limits.\n\nErgo, logic is relative to the thinking of the human species;\nand this thinking is studied by psychology. \n\n\nWho actually held these views, indeed whether anyone did, was hotly\ncontested at the time, but it seems reasonable to attribute PA\n1 to Theodor Lipps (1893) and Gerardus Heymans (1894, 1905),\nPA 2 to Wilhelm Wundt (1880/83), PA 3 to Wilhelm\nJerusalem (1905) and Christoph Sigwart (1921), PA 4 to\nTheodor Elsenhans (1897), and PA 5 to Benno Erdmann (1892).\nWe might also note a couple of quotations that for many authors at the\ntime were paradigmatic expressions of psychologism. The bulk of the\nfirst quotation comes from Mill\u2019s Logic and has already\nbeen quoted in the last section:\n\nSo far as it is a science at all, [Logic] is a part, or branch, of\nPsychology; differing from it, on the one hand as the part differs\nfrom the whole, and on the other, as an Art differs from a Science.\nIts theoretical grounds are wholly borrowed from Psychology, and\ninclude as much of that science as is required to justify its rules of\nart (1865, 359).\n\n\nAnd Theodor Lipps held that\n\n\u2026 logic is a psychological discipline since the process of\ncoming-to-know takes place only in the soul, and since that thinking\nwhich completes itself in this coming-to-know is a psychological\nprocess. The fact that psychology differs from logic in disregarding\nthe opposition between knowledge and error does not mean that\npsychology equates these two different psychological conditions. It\nmerely means that psychology has to explain knowledge and error in the\nsame way. Obviously, no-one claims that psychology dissolves into\nlogic. What separates the two sufficiently is that logic is a\nsub-discipline of psychology (Lipps 1893, 1\u20132).\n\n",
