Beeckman set various problems for Descartes,\nincluding questions about falling bodies, hydrostatics, and\nmathematics. Descartes and Beeckman engaged in what they called\n\u201cphysico-mathematica,\u201d or mathematical physics\n(Beeckman\u2019s journal, in Descartes, 10:52). Since\nantiquity, mathematics had been applied to various physical subject\nmatters, in optics, astronomy, mechanics (focusing on the lever), and\nhydrostatics. Beeckman and Descartes brought to this work a commitment\nto atoms as the basic constituents of matter. As had ancient atomists,\nthey attributed not only size, shape, and motion but also weight to\nthose atoms (10:68). Descartes opened a section in his\nnotebook entitled \u201cDemocritica\u201d (10:8), in honor\nof the ancient atomist Democritus.\n\nPerhaps at this time, though certainly by 1628, Descartes had the\nfundamental insight that makes analytic geometry possible: the\ntechnique for describing lines of various sorts by using mathematical\nequations involving ratios between lengths in relation to coordinate\nlines. (Descartes did not require that the lines be perpendicular to\none another.) Descartes himself did not foresee replacing geometrical\nconstructions with algebraic formulas; rather, he viewed geometry as\nthe basic mathematical science and he considered his algebraic\ntechniques to provide an extension beyond compass-and-ruler\nconstructions. When the right-angled coordinate system of algebraic\ngeometry was subsequently developed, the name \u201cCartesian\ncoordinates\u201d honored Descartes\u2019 discovery. (See Boyer\n1968, Ch. 17, Shea 1991, Ch. 3, and, more generally, Domski 2022.)\n\nDescartes left Breda in 1619 to join the Catholic army of Maximilian I\n(Duke of Bavaria and ally of France). The war concerned the authority\nof Ferdinand II, a Catholic, who in September had been crowned emperor\nof the Holy Roman Empire (located in Central Europe and including\nAustria and parts of northern Italy). Descartes attended the\ncoronation and was returning to the army when winter caught him in the\nsmall town of Ulm (or perhaps Neuburg), not far from Munich. On the\nnight of 10 November 1619, he had three dreams that seemed to provide\nhim with a mission in life. The dreams themselves are interesting and\ncomplex (see Sebba 1987). Descartes took from them the message that he\nshould set out to reform all knowledge. He decided to begin with\nphilosophy, since the principles of the other sciences must be derived\nfrom it (Disc. II, 6:21\u20132).\n\nDescartes was familiar with both mainstream philosophy and recent\ninnovators (those who, among other things, rejected aspects of\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy), from both his schooling and from\nreading he undertook from 1620 on. In 1640, he recalled\n(Corr. 3:185) having read various works in philosophy around\nthe year 1620, written by well-known Jesuit commentators on Aristotle:\nFrancisco Toledo (1532\u201396), Antonio Rubio (1548\u20131615), and\nthe Coimbran commentators (active ca. 1600). He also recalled an\nabstract or summary of \u201cthe whole of scholastic\nphilosophy\u201d by Eustace of Saint Paul (1573\u20131640), whose\nSumma Philosophiae was first published in 1609. In 1638, he\nrecalled having read Thomas Campanella\u2019s De Sensu Rerum\n(1620) about fifteen years before, and not being much impressed\n(2:659\u201360). And in 1630 he was able to rattle off the names of\nrecent innovators in philosophy (1:158), including Campanella\n(1568\u20131639), Bernardino Telesio (1509\u201388), Giordano Bruno\n(1548\u20131600), Lucilio Vanini (1585\u20131619), and\nS\u00e9bastien Basson (b. ca. 1573). From these sources, he would\nhave acquired basic philosophical concepts, such as the notion that\nsubstances are characterized by essences that determine which\nproperties they must have in order to be what they are (an\nAristotelian concept). He would also have seen first attempts, among\nthe innovators, of reviving atomism, or of challenging the notion of\nsubstantial forms (see Sec. 1.3).\n\nDescartes\u2019 activities during the early 1620s are not\nwell-documented. He was in France part of the time, visiting Poitou to\nsell some inherited properties in 1622 and visiting Paris. He also\nwent to Italy (1623\u201325). Upon his return he lived in Paris,\nwhere he was in touch with mathematicians and natural philosophers in\nthe circle of his long-time friend and correspondent Marin Mersenne\n(1588\u20131648). While in Paris, he worked on some mathematical\nproblems and derived the sine law of refraction, which facilitated his\nwork on formulating mathematically the shapes of lenses (later\npublished in the Dioptrics). His major philosophical effort\nduring these years was on the Rules.\n\nIn the Rules, he sought to generalize the methods of\nmathematics so as to provide a route to clear knowledge of everything\nthat human beings can know. His methodological advice included a\nsuggestion that is familiar to students of elementary geometry: break\nyour work up into small steps that you can understand completely and\nabout which you have utter certainty, and check your work often. But\nhe also had advice for the ambitious seeker of truth, concerning where\nto start and how to work up to greater things. Thus, Rule 10 reads:\n\u201cIn order to acquire discernment we should exercise our\nintelligence by investigating what others have already discovered, and\nmethodically survey even the most insignificant products of human\nskill, especially those which display order\u201d (10:403). As\nexamples of \u201csimple\u201d arts \u201cin which order\nprevails\u201d (10:404), he offered carpet-making and embroidery, and\nalso number-games and arithmetic games. He went on to discuss the\nroles of the \u201ccognitive faculties\u201d in acquiring knowledge,\nwhich include the intellect, imagination, sense perception, and\nmemory. These faculties allow the seeker of knowledge to combine\nsimple truths in order to solve complex problems as found in optics\n(10:394) or to discover how a magnet works (10:427).\n\nBy the end of 1628, Descartes abandoned work on the Rules,\nhaving completed about half of the projected treatise. He moved to the\nDutch Netherlands, returning to France only infrequently prior to\nmoving to Sweden in 1649. While in the Netherlands, he tried to keep\nhis address secret and changed locations often, according to his\nmotto, \u201cwho lives well hidden, lives well\u201d (1:286*).\n",
