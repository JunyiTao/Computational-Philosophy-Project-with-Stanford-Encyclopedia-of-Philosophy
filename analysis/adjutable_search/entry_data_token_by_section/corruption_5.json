    "main_text": "Integrity Systems\n4. Integrity Systems\n\nThus far our concern has been with theorizing institutional\ncorruption. Indeed, most of the philosophical work undertaken to date\nhas consisted in such theorizing. However, there are some salient\nexceptions to this. For instance, Pogge has suggested undermining the\ninternational borrowing privileges of authoritarian governments who\nhave removed democratic governments (Pogge 2002 [2008]: Chapter 10);\nWenar (2016) argues for the enforcement of property rights (popular\nresource sovereignty) in relation to the resources curse; Lessig\n(Lessig 2011) has elaborated a raft of specific measures to reform the\nsystem of campaign contributions in the U.S.; Alexandra and Miller\n(2010) have outlined ways to utilize reputational devices in some\nsectors in which reputational loss hurts the \u201cbottom line\u201d\n(see also Brennan & Pettit 2005 for an account of the theoretical\nunderpinnings of such practical reforms).\n\nHowever, at a more general level there is an apparent need on the part\nof philosophers to conceptualize the notion of an anti-corruption\nsystem or, more broadly, an integrity system for institutions\n(Klitgaard 1988; Pope 1997; Anechiarico & Jacobs 1998; Klitgaard\net al. 2000; Preston & Sampford 2002; Baker 2005; Miller 2017). An\nintegrity system is an institutional arrangement the purpose of which\nis to promote ethical attitudes and behavior and, crucially, to\nprevent or, at least, reduce institutional corruption. For instance,\nan integrity system for a police organization might consist of a set\nof laws and regulations, an internal affairs department comprised of\ncorruption investigators, an external oversight body, professional\nreporting mechanisms, an enforceable code of ethics, a complaints and\ndiscipline process, and so on. The contribution of philosophers to\nintegrity systems has been threefold. Firstly, they have offered\nsynoptic or \u201cbirds-eye\u201d views of the architecture of such\nsystems and in so doing determined whether they are fit for normative\ninstitutional purpose. Naturally, this work presupposes theories of\nthe normative institutional purposes of the institutions in question\n(Lessig 2011; Thompson 1995). Secondly, they have addressed a variety\nof ethical issues that have arisen in the design and implementation of\nintegrity systems and their various institutional components.\nConsider, for instance, the range of ethical issues that arise in\nrelation to anti-corruption systems for police organizations, e.g.,\nentrapment, privacy/surveillance (Miller 2016). Thirdly, they have\nidentified the underlying causal and/or rational basis of the\ncorruption and, in light of this, designed appropriate anti-corruption\nmeasures. (Pogge 2002 [2008]: Chapter 6; Lessig 2011); van den Hoven,\nMiller, & Pogge 2017). An important set of structural problems\nfacilitating corruption are collective action problems, e.g.,\nregulatory arbitrage in the global financial system and tax havens\n(Obermayer & Obermaier 2016; Rothstein & Varraich 2017). One\nkind of solution proposed is that of an enforceable cooperative scheme\nat the international level (Eatwell & Taylor 2000).\n\nIntegrity systems can be thought of as being either predominantly\nreactive or predominantly preventive, albeit the distinction is\nsomewhat artificial since there is always a need for both reactive\nelements, e.g., investigations of corrupt actions, and preventive\nelements, e.g., ethics training and transparency mechanisms. Reactive\nsystems are fundamentally linear. They frame laws and regulation that\nset out a series of offences, wait for transgressions, investigate,\nadjudicate and take punitive measures. In many areas, including\ninstitutional corruption, resources are limited and, thus, ethically\ninformed decisions have to be made in relation to the prioritization\nof corrupt activity to be investigated and to what extent. This\nethical problem is to be distinguished from the problem of\nunder-resourcing motivated by a desire to hamstring anti-corruption\ninitiatives. Moreover, both problems are to be distinguished from the\ndebate between those who favor increased laws and regulations to\ncombat, for instance, financial corruption, and those who argue for a\ndecrease in such laws and regulations since they unnecessarily\nincrease the cost of doing business.\n\nPreventive institutional mechanisms for combating corruption can be\ndivided into four categories. Mechanisms designed to reduce the\nmotivation to engage in corruption, e.g., ethics education programs;\nmechanisms to reduce the capacity of those motivated to engage in\ncorruption, e.g., legislation to downsize oligopolies to prevent\ncartels (Rose-Ackerman 1999), exploitation of the lack of trust\nbetween corruptors (Lambsdorff 2007), democratization and the\nseparation of powers (\u201cpower corrupts\u201d (Acton 1887 [1948:\n364]) to reign in powerful, corrupt governments (Johnston 2014);\nmechanisms to eliminate or reduce the opportunity to engage in\ncorruption, e.g., conflict of interest provisions; mechanisms to\nexpose corrupt behavior, e.g., oversight bodies, media organizations\n(Pope 1997; Spence et al. 2011).\n\nIt is self-evident that there is need for both reactive and preventive\nelements if an integrity system is to be adequate. This point obtains\nwhether or not the integrity system in question pertains to a single\norganization, an industry, an occupational group, or an entire\nsociety. However, the reactive and preventive elements need to cohere\nin an overall holistic integrity system (Miller 2017). A further point\noften overlooked is that if an integrity system is to be effective it\npresupposes a framework of accepted social norms in the sense of\nsocially accepted moral principles. Social norms provide the standards\nwhich determine what counts as corruption. Moreover, in so doing they\ndetermine whether or not such behavior will be tolerated or not.\nRevealing corruption has very little effect if the wider community to\nwhom the corruption is revealed are tolerant or otherwise accepting of\nit.\n",
