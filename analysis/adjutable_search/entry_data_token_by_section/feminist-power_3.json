    "main_text": "Power as Domination || Phenomenological Feminist Approaches\n3.1 Phenomenological Feminist Approaches\n\nThe locus classicus of feminist phenomenological approaches\nto theorizing male domination is Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s The\nSecond Sex. Beauvoir\u2019s text provides a brilliant analysis\nof the situation of women: the social, cultural, historical, and\neconomic conditions that define their existence. Her diagnosis of\nwomen\u2019s situation relies on the distinction between being\nfor-itself \u2013 self-conscious subjectivity that is capable of\nfreedom and transcendence \u2013 and being in-itself \u2013 the\nun-self-conscious things that are incapable of freedom and mired in\nimmanence. Beauvoir argues that whereas men have assumed the status of\nthe transcendent subject, women have been relegated to the status of\nthe immanent Other. As she puts it in a famous passage from the\nIntroduction to The Second Sex: \u201cShe is defined and\ndifferentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her;\nshe is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He\nis the Subject, he is the Absolute \u2013 she is the Other\u201d\n(Beauvoir, xxii). This distinction \u2013 between man as Subject and\nwoman as Other \u2013 is the key to Beauvoir\u2019s understanding of\ndomination or oppression. She writes, \u201cevery time transcendence\nfalls back into immanence, stagnation, there is a degradation of\nexistence into the \u2018en-soi\u2019 \u2013 the brutish life of\nsubjection to given conditions \u2013 and liberty into constraint and\ncontingence. This downfall represents a moral fault if the subject\nconsents to it; if it is inflicted upon him, it spells frustration and\noppression. In both cases it is an absolute evil\u201d (Beauvoir,\nxxxv). Although Beauvoir suggests that women are partly responsible\nfor submitting to the status of the Other in order to avoid the\nanguish of authentic existence (hence, they are in bad faith) (see\nBeauvoir xxvii), she maintains that women are oppressed because they\nare compelled to assume the status of the Other, doomed to immanence\n(xxxv). Women\u2019s situation is thus marked by a basic tension\nbetween transcendence and immanence; as self-conscious human beings,\nthey are capable of transcendence, but they are compelled into\nimmanence by cultural and social conditions that deny them that\ntranscendence (see Beauvoir, chapter 21).\n\nSome feminists have criticized Beauvoir's conception of oppression for\nits reliance on a problematic analogy between race and gender (see,\nfor example, her claim that \u201cthere are deep similarities between\nthe situation of woman and that of the Negro,\u201d (Beauvoir,\nxxix)). Beauvoir's frequent use of such analogies, critics contend,\nerases the experience of Black women by implicitly coding all women as\nwhite and all Blacks as male (Gines (Belle) 2010 and 2017, Collins\n2019, 194\u2013198, and Simons 2002). As Kathryn T. Gines (now Kathryn\nSophia Belle) argues further, Beauvoir's analysis deploys\n\u201ccomparative and competing frameworks of oppression\u201d\n(Gines (Belle) 2014a). At times, Beauvoir treats not just sexism and\nracism but also antisemitism, colonialism, and class oppression\ncomparatively, arguing that they rest of similar dynamics of Othering.\nHer comparative analysis of race and gender is most problematic in her\nfrequent analogy between the situation of women and that of the slave.\nAs Belle argues, this analogy not only obscures the experiences of\nBlack female slaves, it also leads Beauvior to \u201cengage in an\nappropriation of Black suffering in the form of slavery to advance her\nphilosophical discussion of woman's situation\u201d (265). At other\ntimes, Beauvoir treats racism, sexism, antisemitism, colonialism, and\nclass oppression as competing frameworks and argues that gender\nsubordination is the most significant and constitutive form of\noppression. Both moves are problematic, according to Belle, the former\nfor its erasure of the oppression of Black women and the latter for\nits privileging of gender oppression over other forms of\noppression.\n\nFeminist phenomenologists have engaged critically with Beauvoir's work\nwhile extending her insights into power. For example, Young argues\nthat Beauvoir pays relatively little attention to the role that female\nembodiment plays in women\u2019s oppression (Young 1990b,\n142\u20133). Although Beauvoir does discuss women\u2019s bodies in\nrelation to their status as immanent Other, she tends to focus on\nwomen\u2019s physiology and how physiological features such as\nmenstruation and pregnancy tie women more closely to nature, thus, to\nimmanence. In her essay, \u201cThrowing Like a Girl,\u201d Young\ndraws on Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u2019s phenomenological analysis of\nthe lived body to analyze \u201cthe situatedness of the woman\u2019s\nactual bodily movement and orientation to its surroundings and its\nworld\u201d (Young 1990b, 143). She notes that girls and women often\nfail to use fully the spatial potential of their bodies (for example,\nthey throw \u201clike girls\u201d), they try not to take up too much\nspace, and they tend to approach physical activity tentatively and\nuncertainly (Young 1990b, 145\u2013147). Young argues that feminine\nbodily comportment, movement, and spatial orientation exhibit the same\ntension between transcendence and immanence that Beauvoir diagnoses in\nThe Second Sex. \u201cAt the root of those\nmodalities,\u201d Young writes, \u201cis the fact that the woman\nlives her body as object as well as subject. The source of this is\nthat patriarchal society defines woman as object, as a mere body, and\nthat in sexist society women are in fact frequently regarded by others\nas objects and mere bodies\u201d (Young 1990b, 155). And yet women\nare also subjects, and, thus, cannot think of themselves as mere\nbodily objects. As a result, woman \u201ccannot be in unity with\nherself\u201d (Young 1990b, 155). Young explores the tension between\ntranscendence and immanence and the lack of unity characteristic of\nfeminine subjectivity in more detail in several other essays that\nexplore pregnant embodiment, women\u2019s experience with their\nclothes, and breasted experience (See Young 1990b, chapters\n9\u201311).\n\nMuch important work in feminist phenomenology follows Young in drawing\ninspiration from Merleau-Ponty\u2019s analyses of embodiment and\nintercorporeality (see Heinamaa 2003, Weiss 1999); like Young, these\nauthors use a Merleau-Pontyian approach to phenomenology to explore\nthe fundamental modalities of female embodiment or feminine bodily\ncomportment. Feminists have also mined the work of Edmund Husserl, the\nfounder of phenomenology, for useful resources for feminist\nphenomenology (Al-Saji 2010 and Oksala 2016).\n\nMore generally, Oksala defends the importance of feminist\nphenomenology as an exploration of gendered experience against\npoststructuralist critics who find such a project hopelessly\nessentialist. While Oksala acknowledges that essentialism is a danger\nfound in some work in feminist phenomenology \u2013 for example, she\nis critical of Sonia Kruks (2001) for \u201cconsidering \u2018female\nexperience\u2019 as an irreducible given grounded in a female\nbody\u201d (Oksala 2016, 72) \u2013 she also insists that a\nphenomenological analysis of experience is crucial for feminism. As\nshe puts it, \u201cit is my contention that feminist theory must\n\u2018retrieve experience\u2019, but this cannot mean returning to a\npre discursive female experience grounded in the commonalities of\nwomen\u2019s embodiment\u201d (40). On her view, experience is\nalways constructed in such a way that it \u201creflects oppressive\ndiscourses and power relations\u201d (43); and yet, experience and\nthought or discourse are not co-extensive. This means that there is\nalways a gap between our personal experience and the linguistic\nrepresentations that we employ to make sense of that experience, and\nit is this gap that provides the space for contestation and critique.\nThus, Oksala concludes, \u201cexperiences can contest discourses even\nif, or precisely because, they are conceptual through and\nthrough\u201d (50). For Oksala, experience plays a crucial role in\nreinforcing and reproducing oppressive power relations, but radical\nreflection on our experience opens up a space for individual and\ncollective resistance to and transformation of those power\nrelations.\n\nThe concept of experience is also central to Mariana Ortega's analysis\nof Latina feminist phenomenology (Ortega 2016). Ortega reads the\nprominent Latina feminists Gloria Anzald\u00faa and Mar\u00eda\nLugones as phenomenologists \u201cwhose writings are deeply informed\nby their lived experience, specifically by their experience of\nmarginalization and oppression as well as their experience of\nresistance\u201d (7). By highlighting the experience of marginalized\nand oppressed selves who live their lives at the borderlands or in a\nstate of in-betweenness, Latina feminist phenomenology, as Ortega\nreads it, offers an important corrective to and expansion of the\ncritique of modern subjectivity in the European phenomenological\ntradition.\n\nFor other influential feminist-phenomenological analyses of domination\nsee Bartky 1990, 2002, Bordo 1993, and Kruks 2001. For helpful\noverviews of feminist phenomenology, see Fisher and Embree 2000, and\nHeinamaa and Rodemeyer 2010. For a highly influential articulation of\nqueer phenomenology, drawing on the work of Husserl, Heidegger,\nMerleau-Ponty, and Fanon, see Ahmed (2006). For a compelling\nphenomenological analysis of transgender experience, see Salamon\n(2010).\n",
