    "main_text": "Grounds of Moral Status || Other Grounds\n5.7 Other Grounds\n\nIn addition to some of the features noted in section 5.3 (e.g., having\ninterests, having a good, etc.), some philosophers have attempted to\nground the moral status of an entity on features that do not connect\nwith interests in any way. One such feature is not being designed by\nanyone to fulfill any purpose, which some philosophers hold as a\nground for being treated as an end and not a mere means, and thus\nhaving at least some degree of moral status (Brennan 1984, pp. 44 and\n56 and Katz 1997, pp. 129\u2013131). Naturalness, that is, being\nunaltered by humans, has also been proposed as itself a ground of\nintrinsic value, and so as grounding at least some degree of moral\nstatus (Elliot 1997, p. 80). Perhaps harmony and beauty might be yet\nother features one could appeal to as grounds of the moral status of\necosystems (Leopold 1949 and Callicott 1980). These views do not\ndiscuss whether moral status comes in degrees and provide no guidance\nfor how to adjudicate the numerous conflicts that would arise among\nentities with moral status. Insofar as these two issues are addressed\nby supplementing these views with one (or more) of the accounts\ndiscussed in sections 5.1\u20135.6, the views will inherit the\nproblems of those accounts. For elaboration of these and other such\nviews as they arise in environmental ethics, along with critiques, see\nthe entry on\n environmental ethics.\n",
