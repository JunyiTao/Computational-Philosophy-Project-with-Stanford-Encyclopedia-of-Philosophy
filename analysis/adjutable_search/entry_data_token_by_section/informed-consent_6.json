    "main_text": "Why informed consent? || Self-ownership\n2.5 Self-ownership\n\nAnother rationale surrounds self-ownership: we are presumed to hold\nproprietary rights over ourselves and our bodies, perhaps in line with\nJohn Locke\u2019s idea that \u201cevery Man has a\n Property\n in his own Person\u201d (Locke 1988, V. 27, 305).\nNaturally, once an owner\u2019s consent is given, the alleged\nproprietary prohibition on access and on direct impact is removed.\nThis rationale may better explain why we must normally grant our\npermission, even for medical intervention that is safe, low-impact,\nand clearly beneficial, and requires no agency on our part. Trespass\ninto a private sphere can be forbidden even when it involves mere\ntouching, and the owner is foolish or selfish to reject it (Archard\n2008, 27f; Thomson 1990, ch. 8; Nozick 1986).\n\nBut an account based on self-ownership raises more questions than it\nsettles. Self-ownership may just mean that the individual\nshould be the final arbiter in the relevant sphere, and that seems\nlike a part of what informed consent requires\u2014hardly an edifying\nrationalization for requiring informed consent (compare Cohen 1995,\nchs. 9\u201310). Alternatively, self-ownership may designate a more\ncircumscribed list of rights (Fried 2005; Archard 2008, 29\u201330),\nbut this list would also stand in need of a defense, and cannot by\nitself count as adequate justification. A further challenge is that\nthe self-ownership rationale fails to clarify why touching sensitive\nareas of the body without consent seems worse than touching less\nsensitive areas without consent. Property violation is not usually a\nmatter of degree (compare Archard 2008, 30\u20131). Finally, the\nself-ownership rationale fails to clarify why physicians must disclose\nand ensure our comprehension of information prior to intervention,\nsomething which proprietary rights seldom require. Indeed, the notion\nof self-ownership could be used against coercing doctors to\ngive patients that information\u2014because such coercion may violate\nthese physicians\u2019 self-ownership rights to interact as they\nwill.\n",
