    "main_text": "The Search for a Philosophical Foundation for Marxism and the Radical Subject || Negative (Dialectical) Thinking and Social Change\n3.3 Negative (Dialectical) Thinking and Social Change\n\n\nIn 1941 Marcuse\u2019s studies of Marx and Hegel culminated in a book\nentitled Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social\nTheory (1941 [1983]). This book accomplished several\nthings. First, it disclosed the role of Hegel\u2019s most critical,\nrevolutionary, and emancipatory concepts in the development of\nMarx\u2019s critical philosophy. Secondly, it rescued Hegel from the\ncharge that his social and political philosophy was conservative and\nlegitimated the oppressive Prussian state. The third great\naccomplishment, or at least goal, embodies the first two\naccomplishments and is perhaps the most important for the formation of\nMarcuse\u2019s form of critical theory. The Hegelian/Marxian notion\nof dialectic or what Marcuse will call negative thinking becomes a\ncentral element in Marcuse\u2019s critical theory. In part,\nReason and Revolution is not an attempt to rescue Hegel, but\nrather, an attempt to rescue dialectical or negative thinking. Marcuse\nmakes this clear in a new preface to the 1960 edition of the book. The\nnew preface entitled \u201cA Note on Dialectic\u201d can actually\nstand on its own as a guide to reading and understanding Marcuse.\nMarcuse begins with the claim that this book is an attempt to rescue a\nform of thinking or a mental faculty which is in danger of being\nobliterated (Marcuse 1960: vii).\n\n\nThe purpose of dialectical or negative thinking is to expose and then\novercome by revolutionary action the contradictions by which advanced\nindustrial societies are constituted. The problem of concealment\noccurs here because not only does society produce contradictions and\nthe forms of domination that come with them, but also produces the\nsocial and psychological mechanisms that conceal these\ncontradictions. An example of a social contradiction is the\nco-existence of the growth of national wealth and poverty at the same\ntime. Those who own, control, and influence the means of production\n(the minority) grow richer while the workers (the minority) grow\npoorer. The idea that the unbridled attempt by the rich to become\nricher will somehow allow their wealth to trickle down so that all\nwill benefit has been proven false as the gap between the rich and\npoor continues to grow. However, the trickle down ideology is still\nvery effective. The capitalist belief that unbridled competition is\ngood for everyone conceals the goal of purging society of competition\nby allowing large corporations to buy out their competition.\n\nIn this situation, the worker does not become a free and rational\nsubject through her labor, but rather, an object to be used by the\neconomic system, a system that is a human creation, but over which the\nworker has no control. In the capitalist system, the worker is used as\nan object for the sake of production while not reaping the full\nbenefits of production. In such a situation the worker is not able to\nactualize his or her potential as a free and rational human being but\nis instead reduced to a life of toil for the sake of survival. The\nexistence of the worker erases her essence. The task of dialectical\nthinking is to bring this situation to consciousness. Once this\nsituation is brought to consciousness it can be resolved through\nrevolutionary practice. Thus, Kellner writes:\n\n The central concepts presented are precisely those of the\nbook\u2019s title, \u201creason\u201d and\n\u201crevolution\u201d. Reason distinguishes between existence and\nessence through conceptualizing unrealized potentialities, norms and\nideals that are to be realized in social practice. If social\nconditions prevent their realization, reason calls for\nrevolution. (Kellner 1984: 131) \n\nMarcuse\u2019s concept of essence is not transcendental but\nhistorical. That is, there is no human essence apart from\nhistorical context. Within the context of historical happening,\nwithin material existence, what the human being could potentially be is\nalready present. For example, it seems logical to assert that no\nhuman being would want to spend his or her entire life engaged in\nalienating labor just to remain in poverty. Nevertheless, this is\nprecisely the situation in which many human beings find\nthemselves. However, essence is embedded in this historical\nappearance insofar as the potential for the worker to be free from\nexploitation and alienating toil is present as a real possibility that\nneed only be actualized. In the society wherein the worker works\nthere is enough wealth (produced by the worker) to free the worker of\nendless toil. In an essay entitled \u201cThe Concept of\nEssence\u201d Marcuse writes: \u201cMaterialist theory thus\ntranscends the given state of fact and moves toward a different\npotentiality, proceeding from immediate appearance to the essence that\nappears in it. But here appearance and essence become members of\na real antithesis arising from the particular historical structure of\nthe social process of life\u201d (Marcuse 1968b: 67). \n\nThe above passage is crucial for understanding the theme of\nReason and Revolution and Marcuse\u2019s famous later work\nOne-Dimensional Man (1964) (which will be discussed later). His\nconcept of essence is not static or transcendental. Essence\npresents itself as the possibility of a free non-alienating,\nnon-repressive form of life within a particular historical,\nsocial/political structure. Appearance (the present order of\nthings) is in contradiction to the very possibilities that are produced\nby the present social reality. For example, the capitalist mode\nof production has made it possible for all members of our society to\nlive non-alienating and fruitful lives. However, many are still\nin poverty. Dialectical or negative thinking sees this\ncontradiction and attempts to negate such circumstances. \n The concept of negation is best understood by distinguishing\nbetween two levels of negation in capitalist societies. The concept of\nnegation employed by Marcuse is actually a critical response to a\nprior form of negation. This prior form of negation will be referred\nto as negation1 and the response to it as negation2. Negation1 is the\nnegation of human essence or freedom by an oppressive, repressive\nsocio/economic system. Here the potential for liberation,\nself-development, self-determination, the good life, etc. are all\nerased by various forms of domination. Hence, the human individual is\nnegated. Negation2 refers to the development of critical,\nrevolutionary consciousness that seeks to negate these oppressive\nsocial structures. The goal of negation2 is liberation (Farr 2009: 85\u201386). \n\nThere are many other features of Reason and Revolution that\nare worth discussing here, especially Marcuse\u2019s critique of\npositivism. However, these issues will come up again in other\nworks that will be discussed later. Suffice it to say that at\nthis point Marcuse presents negative thinking as an alternative to what\nhe will later call one-dimensional thinking. It is through\nnegative thinking and revolution that liberation becomes\npossible. In the next section we will examine another possibility\nfor liberation. \n",
