    "main_text": "Why Do Comparative Philosophy If It\u2019s So Hard?\n5. Hybridity as a result of comparative philosophizing\n\nIt was stipulated at the beginning that comparative philosophy brings\ntogether philosophical traditions that have developed in relative\nisolation from one another. It is time to emphasize the\n\u2018relative\u2019 qualifier. A common assumption of those who do\nphilosophy in the West nowadays is that it had its roots in Greece.\nPark (2013), however, has argued that the more common view in the\neighteenth century was that it began in India and/or Africa, which\nthen passed it onto Greece. And as Van Norden (2017) points out,\nEuropean philosophers who encountered Chinese thought in the 17th\ncentury immediately recognized it as philosophy. The Jesuits, who were\ndeeply trained in philosophy, produced the first major translation of\nthe Analects into a European language, and titled it\nConfucius Sinarum Philosophus (Confucius the Chinese\nPhilosopher, 1687). Leibniz was greatly struck by the way the\nBook of Changes represents the structure of the world through\na system of broken and unbroken lines, which he believed to bear\nuncanny resemblance to his invention of binary arithmetic, which was\nto become the digital language of computers. \n\nChinese and Western traditions may currently be undergoing an\nincreased period of interaction and mutual influence. Wong (2009)\ndevelops a metaethical theory drawing from contemporary forms of\nphilosophical naturalism, Hume, Mencius, and Xunzi. Stephen Angle\n(2012) defines two kinds of comparative philosophy: (a) \u201crooted\nglobal philosophy\u201d is working within a particular live\nphilosophical tradition in such a way as to be open to stimulus and\ninsights from other philosophical traditions, and (b)\n\u201cConstructive engagement,\u201d on the other hand, is an\napproach that is focused on the interaction of stimulus and insights\nbetween two live philosophical traditions. Angle exemplifies the\nrooted approach by working within the neo-Confucian tradition and by\nbeing open to exchange with other philosophies, primarily within the\nAmerican tradition. At the same time, his position as an American\nphilosopher allows Angle to focus on mutually enriching interaction\nbetween American philosophy and neo-Confucianism. Joseph Chan is\ngrounded both in Confucian ethical and political thought, primarily\nclassical, and in contemporary Anglo-American political philosophy. He\nregards himself as a Confucian scholar in the sense of one who engages\nin the activity of making sense of Confucian thought, and develops,\nrevises, and improves it as a tradition. At the same time, his\nproposed improvements of the tradition are related to a broader\nargument that the modern language of freedom, rights, and democracy\nshould not and will not replace the traditional language of virtue,\nresponsibility, and benevolent care, but rather be enriched by it\n(2013). \n\nHutton (2006), Sarkissian (2010) and Slingerland (2011) develop\nresponses based on Confucian moral psychology and virtue ethics to\nchallenges mounted by Gilbert Harman (1998\u201399) and John Doris\n(2002) to the viability of virtue ethics (as conceived in the Western\ntradition). A contingent of those working in Chinese philosophy have\nfound that its insights into moral psychology resonate with recent\nfindings in cognitive and social psychology and neuroscience (see\nFlanagan, 2017; Sarkissian, 2010; Slingerland, 2011; Wong 2015a,\n2015b; Cline, 2015; Bruya, 2015; Seok, 2017). Besides the\ncontributions of Confucian moral psychology, insights contained in\nDaoist texts such as the Zhuangzi resonate with recent\nfindings in cognitive psychology and cognitive science concerning the\nintuitive, automatic and non-conscious operations of the mind and body\n(Slingerland, 2014; Bruya, 2015; Wong, 2017).\n\nAs mentioned above, Cline (2007, 2013) argues that insights from the\nAnalects and from Rawls can be combined to produce a more\nplausible conception of how a sense of justice develops starting with\nthe family. More recently (2015), she has argued that Confucians were\nright about the critical importance of parental-child relationships to\nthe moral development and well-being of the individual, and connects\nwith contemporary psychological theories of development and successful\nsocial welfare programs that seek to support parents raising their\nchildren. \n\nIn writing about the concepts of integrity and vulnerability as they\napply to early Confucian texts, Ing provides a particularly fruitful\ndemonstration of how the comparative philosopher can set up a\ndialogical relationship between the texts and the contemporary\ninquirer, such that \u201cthe text shapes the questions we ask as\nmuch as the questions we ask shape our readings of the texts\u201d\n(2017: 10\u201311). \u2018Integrity\u2019 is a term for which there is no\nreadily translatable equivalent in classical Chinese. Ing first\nglosses it in a familiar way as wholeness and integration, but then\nrelying upon the Confucian idea that persons are at least partly\nconstituted by relationships, Ing proposes that integrity is\nunderstood as a social relation. The work of integration is not purely\ninternal but also about tending to one\u2019s current relationships\nas well as entering into new ones that further self-cultivation.\nVulnerability also has the familiar meaning of susceptibility to harm,\nbut Ing imbues it with a meaning at home in certain feminist analyses\nand in Confucianism: an openness and affectivity that comes with\nrelationships, together with our human inability to predict, control\nand to fully know that to which we are open and how it will affect us.\nOur vulnerability to harm is of a piece with that which makes our\nlives most worthwhile. Because our relationships are plural and of\ndifferent kinds, we are vulnerable to conflicts between their\nrequirements. Confucians have traditionally been much concerned with\nconflicts engendered by one\u2019s attempts to better a social and\npolitical world rife with corruption and immorality. One prominent\nstance toward these conflicts present in some of the most prominent\nConfucian texts such as the Mencius and the work of Zhu Xi is\nthat an inability to resolve such conflicts stems from a lack of skill\nor virtue. The stories about Shun the sage-king told in the\nMencius (cited in section 2 above) are presented as models of\nskilled and virtuous resolution of value conflicts. However, an\nalternative stance toward value conflicts also found in a tradition as\nrich and as diverse as Confucianism is that the world can sometimes\ndefeat even the best we can muster from ourselves. One particularly\nstriking apparent clash of values that resists harmonization is the\nstory of Shen Ming as told by the Han Shi Waizhuan. Shen Ming\nbecame minister of Chu. Enemies captured and threatened to execute his\nfather in an attempt to get him to turn against Chu. Known for his\nfiliality, Shen nevertheless decided to attack and defeated the\ninsurgents, and his father was killed. Unable to bear the fact that he\ndid not fulfill his duties of filiality while maintaining loyalty to\nhis ruler, Shen killed himself. The tragedy of this situation is\ncompounded by Shen Ming\u2019s being initially reluctant to accept\nthe position because he feared conflicts between loyalty to ruler and\nfilial care. He accepts only at his father\u2019s urging him to do\nso, partly because he would with his salary be better able to support\nhis father. An act of filial care thus leads to the father\u2019s\ndeath for the sake of loyalty to ruler. That which is of greatest\nvalue to us can make our lives impossible. Such a conclusion is not\nunfamiliar, of course, but the path we take to get to it, through a\ndialogue between traditions, brings it home with a force and vivacity\nthat demonstrates the power of comparative philosophy. \n",
