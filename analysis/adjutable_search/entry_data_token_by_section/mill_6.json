    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy || Arithmetic, Geometry and Necessity\n3.4 Arithmetic, Geometry and Necessity\n\nAmongst the Laws of Nature learnt by way of inductive reasoning are\nthe laws of geometry and arithmetic. It is worth emphasizing that in\nno case does Mill think that the ultimately inductive nature of the\nsciences\u2014whether physical, mathematical, or\nsocial\u2014precludes the deductive organization and\npractice of the science (Ryan 1987: 3\u201320). Manifestly,\nwe do work through many inferences in deductive terms\u2014and this\nis nowhere clearer than in the case of mathematics. Mill\u2019s claim\nis simply that any premise or non-verbal inference can only be as\nstrong as the inductive justification that supports it.\n\nArithmetic, Mill holds, is at base non-verbal. That two plus one is\nequal to three is not \n\n\na definition of the word three; a statement that mankind have agreed\nto use the name three as a sign exactly equivalent to two and one; to\ncall by the former name whatever is called by the other more clumsy\nname. (System, VII: 253) \n\n\nIn contrast to many in the empiricist tradition\u2014including his\nfather\u2014Mill holds that mathematical propositions assert genuine\nfacts. \u201c[T]here is in every step of arithmetical or\nalgebraically calculation a real induction, a real inference of facts\nfrom facts\u201d (System, VII: 254). That we perform\noperations in a deductive manner in the following case:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n 2 \\times (2+1) & = 2 \\times 3\\\\\n & = 6\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nshould not obscure that the validity of each move is established by\ninduction. We establish that two plus one is equal to three by\ngeneralization from specific instances: that two pebbles and one\npebble together make three pebbles, that two horses and one horse\ntogether make three horses, and so on. So too other such arithmetic\nlaws. Of course, as is the case with our discovery of physical laws,\nthe laws which we learn first are, as the \u201cScience of\nNumber\u201d grows more sophisticated, subsumed as instances of more\nfundamental laws\u2014and can eventually be shown to follow from the\naxioms of mathematics (System, VII: 253, 608ff.).\n\nGeometrical propositions, too, are inferred from premises which\nthemselves have real content. Such premises\u2014that, for instance,\nwe can draw a straight line connecting any two single points\u2014are\nnot mere verbal propositions. Indeed, Mill claims, such premises are\nnot strictly even true of the real space we encounter in experience:\nneither perfectly single points, nor perfectly straight lines exist in\nnature. These are rather idealizations of that space\u2014but\nidealizations which are based on principles that could only be known\nby inductive generalization of our observations. The same holds for\nthe results of geometric reasoning (System, VII:\n 224ff.).[3]\n\nMill\u2019s account of mathematics is brief, and raises many issues.\nAmongst the most pressing questions pertain to the status of the\nobjects which mathematicians talk about. The Platonist can\ncharacterize the claims of mathematics as claims about abstract\nobjects\u2014but, as a naturalist, no such option is open to Mill.\n\u201cAll numbers must be numbers of something: there are no such\nthings as numbers in the abstract\u201d (System, VII: 254).\nSimilarly, there are no real objects corresponding to the definitions\nof geometry (System, VII: 225). Mill, rather, claims that\nnumbers are properties of aggregates and as such denote aggregates\nwith those properties, and takes geometrical objects to be limit cases\nof real world objects (System, VII: 610\u20131,\n226\u20139). More, however, needs to be said about the referents of\nthe entities appealed to in the higher regions of\nmathematics\u2014higher order sets, imaginary numbers, the\ntransfinites\u2014as well as how to construe \u2018limit\ncases\u2019 naturalistically (Shapiro 2000: 91\u2013102,\n226\u201356; Kitcher 1998). One can, perhaps, take mathematical\nobjects to be fictions (Balaguer 2014)\u2014but specifying how such\nfictions can be subject to constrained standards of truth and falsity\nremains difficult.\n\nThat Mill holds that even mathematics is founded upon\ninductive reasoning is perhaps most interesting because it\ndemonstrates the radical and thoroughgoing nature of his empiricism.\nIndeed, Mill saw this aspect of his work in just this\nway\u2014combatting the a priori and intuitionist school by\n\u201cdriv[ing] it from its stronghold\u201d\n(Autobiography, I: 233). Mill\u2019s denial of the a\npriori status of mathematical propositions, of course, challenges\nthe commonplace idea that, when true, such propositions are true\nnecessarily. Indeed, the rejection of the possibility of\na priori knowledge as such challenges the notion that there\nare any necessary truths. Mill does not shy away from this\nimplication. Truths can be better or worse established\u2014central\nor peripheral to our understanding of the world\u2014and we can\ntherefore be more or less willing to abandon them. But Mill shows\nlittle interest in principled or absolute modal distinctions between\nnecessary and contingent truths. Rather, Mill argues, some\npropositions seem to us necessary because of processes of\npsychological association make them so ingrained that their denial\nseems to us inconceivable.\n",
