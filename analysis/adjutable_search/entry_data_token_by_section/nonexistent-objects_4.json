    "main_text": "Further Motivations for Belief in Nonexistent Objects || The Problem of Fictional Discourse\n3.2 The Problem of Fictional Discourse\n\nBy \u201cfictional discourse\u201d we mean here and in what follows\ndiscourse about fictitious objects. Sometimes, the term\n\u201cfictitious object\u201d is used as synonymous with\n\u201cnonexistent object\u201d. Here, the term is used in a\ndifferent sense, namely for objects (characters, things, events etc.)\nwhich occur in fictions, i.e., in myths or fairy tales, in fictional\nnovels, movies, operas etc. Pegasus is a fictitious object in this\nsense (as are Sherlock Holmes and Hamlet) but Vulcan (the hypothetical\nplanet sought by Le Verrier) is not.\n\nConsider, for instance, the sentence\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nLike many other sentences of fictional discourse, it appears to\nfulfill the following three conditions:\n\nIt has the grammatical structure of a predication, i.e., the\nstructure that is rendered in logical notation by\n\u201c\\(Fb\\)\u201d (where \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d stands for a\npredicate expression\u2014here: \u201cis a flying\nhorse\u201d\u2014and \u201c\\(b\\)\u201d stands for a singular\nterm\u2014here: \u201cPegasus\u201d).\nThe singular term in subject position is a name for a fictitious\nobject.\nIt is commonly, and with good reason, taken to be true.\n\n\nThe problem of fictional discourse is closely connected to two logical\nprinciples. The first one is well known as \u201cthe principle of\nexistential generalization\u201d:\n\nExistential Generalization \\((\\mathbf{EG})\\):\n\n\\(Fb \\rightarrow \\exists x(Fx)\\), i.e.,\n\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then there is something that is\n \\(F\\).[6]\n\n\nThe second principle is less prominent, rather seldom explicitly\nstated, but often tacitly assumed. We call it \u201cthe predication\nprinciple\u201d:\n\nPredication Principle \\((\\mathbf{PP})\\):\n\n\\(Fb \\rightarrow \\exists x(x = b)\\).[7]\n\n\n(PP) may be read in two ways:\n\n(PPa)\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then there is something that is\nidentical with \\(b\\).\n(PPb)\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then \\(b\\) exists.\n\n\nBoth principles are prima facie extremely plausible: If it is\ntrue of some individual that the predicate \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d\napplies to it, then the predicate \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d\napplies to something. If some predicate\n\u201c\\(F\\)\u201d applies to an individual, then the individual\nhas to exist (for if it were otherwise, how could the predicate apply\nto it?).\n\nYet, when applied to fictional discourse, these two principles lead to\nconsequences that seem to contradict hard empirical facts on the one\nhand and trivial truths about the ontological status of fictitious\nobjects on the other. According to (EG), the sentence\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nimplies\n\n(2)\nThere are flying horses.\n\n\nYet, as we all know, there are no flying horses.\n\nAccording to (PP),\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nimplies\n\n(3)\nPegasus exists.\n\n\nBut Pegasus is a fictitious object; and it seems that to call an\nobject fictitious is just to say that it does not exist.\n\nThe problem is that obviously true sentences of fictional discourse\nseem to lead into outright contradictions. Of course, there are\nseveral ways to avoid the contradictions. One of them consists in\nrejecting the principles (EG) and (PP). By this move, one blocks the\ninference from \u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d to \u201cThere\nare flying horses\u201d and \u201cPegasus exists\u201d. Indeed,\nsome logicians, notably proponents of Free Logics, take this path.\n(See Crane 2013, Hintikka 1959, Lambert 1983 and 1991, Leonard\n 1956.)[8]\n Again (as with the case of negative singular existence statements)\nthis raises the question of what the truthmakers of such sentences\nare. There are attempts to answer this question in a\n\u201creductionist\u201d fashion, i.e., to claim that sentences\nabout fictitious objects are made true not by fictitious objects but\nby something else, e.g., by literary works, myths, stories or facts\nabout these,\n respectively.[9]\n\nAnother way to avoid the contradictions would be simply to reject the\nsentence \u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d (and, in general, all\nalleged predications about fictitious objects) as false or untrue.\nThis radical solution, however, fails to do justice to the widespread\nintuition that there is a difference in truth-value between\n\u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d and, say, \u201cPegasus is a\nflying dog\u201d.\n\nA third attempt to resolve the problem is what may be called\n\u201cthe story-operator strategy\u201d. According to the\nstory-operator strategy, we have to interpret sentences of fictional\ndiscourse as incomplete. A complete rendition of, for instance,\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nwould be as follows:\n\n(1\u2032)\nAccording to the story \\(S\\) (where\n\u201c\\(S\\)\u201d here and in what follows stands for the story\nof Greek mythology): Pegasus is a flying horse.\n\n\nThe expression \u201caccording to the story \\(S\\)\u201d is the\nso-called \u201cstory\n operator\u201d,[10]\n which is a sentence operator (that is, it is the sentence as\na whole that is in its scope, not just a part of the sentence, for\ninstance the predicate). While the sentence within the scope of the\nstory operator (here: \u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d) may be\nfalse when taken in isolation, the complete sentence may be true.\n(This strategy is developed in detail in K\u00fcnne 1990.)\n\nSentence (1\u2032) does not imply that there are flying\nhorses; neither does it imply that Pegasus exists. Thus, the\ncontradictions are\n avoided.[11]\n This looks like an elegant solution, at least as long as we confine\nourselves to a particular kind of example. Unfortunately, however, it\ndoes not work equally well for all kinds of sentences of fictional\ndiscourse. Consider, for instance:\n\n(4)\nPegasus is a character from Greek mythology.\n\n\nThis sentence seems to be straightforwardly true; but if we put a\nstory operator in front of it, we get a straightforward falsehood:\n\n(4\u2032)\nAccording to the story \\(S\\): Pegasus is a character\nfrom Greek mythology.\n\n\nIt is not true that according to the relevant story, Pegasus is a\ncharacter. Rather, according to this story, Pegasus is a living being\nof flesh and blood.\n\nOne may call sentences like \u201cPegasus is a flying horse\u201d or\n\u201cHamlet hates his stepfather\u201d \u201cinternal\nsentences of fictional discourse\u201d, in distinction from\nexternal sentences of fictional discourse, like\n\u201cPegasus is a character from Greek mythology\u201d or\n\u201cHamlet has fascinated many psychoanalysts\u201d. The story\noperator strategy can be applied to internal sentences only and thus\nfails as a general solution to the problem of fictional\n discourse.[12]\n\nThe claim that there are nonexistent objects provides a solution that\ncan be applied uniformly both to internal and external sentences of\nfictional discourse. It allows us to admit that fictitious objects do\nnot exist but at the same time to acknowledge that there\nare fictitious objects. According to this position, fictitious\nobjects are just a species of nonexistent objects.\n\nIn order to see how this assumption is supposed to avoid the\ncontradictions spelled out above, consider:\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying\n horse.[13]\n(2)\nThere are flying horses. (1, EG)\n(3)\nThere are no flying horses.\n\n\nAccording to the Meinongian solution, premise 3 has to be rejected as\nfalse. The Meinongian grants that flying horses do not exist,\nbut this does not imply that there are no flying horses.\nAccording to the Meinongian, there are flying horses, and they belong\nto the class of nonexistent objects, and Pegasus is one of them.\nPremise 3 may be replaced by\n\n(3\u2032)\nFlying horses do not exist.\n\n\nBut this does not contradict\n\n(2)\nThere are flying horses.\n\n\nThus, the problem is\n solved.[14]\n\nConsider next:\n\n(1)\nPegasus is a flying horse.\n(2)\nPegasus exists. (1, PP)\n(3)\nPegasus is a fictitious object.\n(4)\nFictitious objects do not exist.\n(5)\nPegasus doesn\u2019t exist. (3, 4)\n\n\nIn this case, the Meinongian solution consists in rejecting premise 2.\nThe Meinongian cannot accept 2, since Pegasus is supposed to be a\nnonexistent object.\n\nWhat, then, about the predication principle? Does the Meinongian have\nto reject it?\u2014Not necessarily. Remember that (PP) can be read in\n(at least) two ways:\n\n(PPa)\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then there is something that is\nidentical with \\(b\\).\n(PPb)\nIf \\(b\\) is \\(F\\), then \\(b\\) exists.\n\n\nWithin the Meinongian framework, these two readings are not\nequivalent. According to the Meinongian, certainly there is something\nthat is identical with Pegasus, although Pegasus does not exist. Thus,\nthe Meinongian must reject the reading (PPb), but she can (and does)\naccept the reading\n (PPa).[15]\n\nSince the Meinongian accepts only the weaker version (PPa) of the\npredication principle, the inference from premise 1 (\u201cPegasus is\na flying horse\u201d) to \u201cPegasus exists\u201d is blocked. All\nthat can be derived from premise 1 is the weaker claim\n\n(2\u2032)\nThere is something that is identical with Pegasus.\n\n\nBut this is not in conflict with \u201cPegasus does not exist\u201d.\nThus, the problem is resolved.\n\nAlternatively, one may abstain from the Meinongian distinction between\nbeing and existence and hold that fictitious objects are existent\nabstract objects. According to this position, \u201cPegasus does not\nexist\u201d has to be rejected as false, and thus, again, the\ncontradiction is avoided. This position (it might be called\n\u201cabstractionism with respect to fictitious objects\u201d) comes\nin two varieties. The first one might be characterized, in a somewhat\nsimplified fashion, as follows: To every set of properties, there\nis/exists a corresponding abstract object. These abstract objects\nexist necessarily. Some of them occur in fictional stories, and these\nare what we call \u201cfictitious objects\u201d. Thus, fictitious\nobjects are necessarily existent objects that have been somehow\n\u201cdiscovered\u201d or \u201cselected\u201d by the authors of\nfictional stories. (For this position, see, for instance, Parsons\n1975, Zalta 1983 and 1988, Jacquette 1996, Berto 2008 and Priest 2011.\nActually, this is one of the applications of contemporary versions of\nMeinongianism. See Sections 5.4 and 5.5 below.) According to the other\nvariety of abstractionism, fictitious objects are abstract artefacts,\ni.e., they are not discovered or selected but created by the\nauthors of fictional\n stories.[16]\n\nThe latter view (today often referred to as \u201ccreationism\u201d)\nfits well into a general ontology of abstract artefacts (like, for\ninstance, literary and other works of fiction as well as non-fictional\ncultural entities) and does justice to the intuition that fictitious\nobjects as well as the works in which they occur are literally brought\ninto being through human acts of creation. However, it is objected\nagainst creationism that the creation of an abstract object is\nsomething deeply mysterious.\n",
