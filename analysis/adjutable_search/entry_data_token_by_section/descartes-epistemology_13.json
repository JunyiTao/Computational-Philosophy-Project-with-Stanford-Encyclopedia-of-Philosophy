    "main_text": "C&D Rule and the Road to Perfect Knowledge || Fourth Meditation Proof of the C&D Rule\n5.3 Fourth Meditation Proof of the C&D Rule\n\nIt might seem that a separate argument for the C&D Rule is\nunneeded \u2013 that having demonstrated a non-deceiving God, the\nveracity of the rule is a straightforward consequence. But this is too\nfast. Why should only the C&D Rule be a straightforward\nconsequence, but not also a more general infallibility of all\nour judgments? Essentially this point is made in the First Meditation,\nat the introduction of the Evil Genius Doubt. As we saw, the meditator\nthere observes that what seems to follow from the standard view\n\u2013 whereby God \u201cis said to be supremely good,\u201d rather\nthan a deceiver \u2013 is that God would not allow us ever\nto be mistaken in our judgments:\n\nBut if it were inconsistent with his goodness to have created me such\nthat I am deceived all the time, it would seem equally foreign to his\ngoodness to allow me to be deceived even occasionally; yet this last\nassertion cannot be made. (Med. 1, AT 7:21, CSM 2:14)\n\n\nIn short, the most straightforward consequence of an all-perfect\ncreator would seem to be the universal rule: If I form a judgment,\nthen it is true. Yet quite clearly, this rule\ndoesn\u2019t hold. What emerges is an instance of the problem of\nevil, here applied to judgment error. As the passage reasons:\n\nJudgment error occurs.\nThat judgment error occurs is incompatible with the hypothesis\nthat I am the creation of an all-perfect God.\nTherefore, I am not the creation of an all-perfect God.\n\n\nThese First Meditation remarks set the stage for the discussion\nthat comes in the Fourth Meditation. Descartes needs a theodicy\nfor error \u2013 theodicy being an effort to explain how\nan all-perfect God is compatible with evil. The theodicy needs to\nshow that the existence of such a God is compatible with some forms\nof judgment error, but not others; somehow, God allows error in our \nsensory judgments, while guaranteeing the inerrancy of judgments\nbased on clear and distinct perception. In contrast with the First \nMeditation setting, the context of the Fourth Meditation comes on\nthe heels of a demonstration of the existence of an all-perfect\nGod. The argument of the Fourth Meditation thus begins by reviewing\nthe problem where the First Meditation left it, but in the light of\nthe meditator\u2019s newfound conclusion \u2013 \u201cto begin\nwith, I recognize that it is impossible that God should ever deceive \nme.\u201d The passage continues:\n\nNext, I know by experience that there is in me a\nfaculty of judgement which, like everything else which is in me, I\ncertainly received from God. And since God does not wish to deceive\nme, he surely did not give me the kind of faculty which would ever\nenable me to go wrong while using it correctly.\nThere would be no further doubt on this issue\nwere it not that what I have just said appears to imply that I am\nincapable of ever going wrong. For if everything that is in me comes\nfrom God, and he did not endow me with a faculty for making mistakes,\nit appears that I can never go wrong. (Med. 4, AT 7:53f, CSM 2:37f)\n\n\nSeeking to resolve the problem, the meditator investigates the\ncauses of error. In the course of the discussion, Descartes puts \nforward his theory whereby judgment arises from the cooperation\nof the intellect and the will: the role of the \nintellect is to consider a perceptual content \u2013 i.e.,\nsomething seeming to be the case, thereby functioning as a\npossible judgment; the role of the will is to give assent (or\ndissent), or withhold assent, to the perceptual content under \nconsideration.\n\nThe investigation concludes that the blameworthy cause of error\nlies in our improper use of our free will. Neither the intellect\nnor the will is inherently defective (though each is, of course,\nfinite), nor is there inherent defect in the design of how they \ncooperate \u2013 i.e., their design does not render error\ninevitable. The design does make for the possibility of error,\nin that \u201cthe scope of the will is wider than that of the \nintellect\u201d: my will is able to assent to further matters\nthan just those that I clearly and distinctly understand; \u201cbut \ninstead of restricting it within the same limits, I extend its use\nto matters which I do not understand\u201d (AT 7:58, CSM 2:40).\nIn short, actual mistakes of judgment arise from user error:\n\n[If] I simply refrain from making a judgement in cases where I do not\nperceive the truth with sufficient clarity and distinctness, then it\nis clear that I am behaving correctly and avoiding error. But if in\nsuch cases I either affirm or deny, then I am not using my free will\ncorrectly. (Med. 4, AT 7:59, CSM 2:41)\n\n\nThe theodicy that emerges is a version of the free will defense.\nAccordingly, we should thank God for giving us free will, but the cost\nof having free will is the possibility of misusing it. Since error is\nthe result of misusing our free will, we should not blame God.\n\nNot only is the theodicy used to explain the kinds of error God\ncan allow, it serves to clarify the kinds of error God\ncannot allow. From the latter arises a proof of the C&D\nRule. God can allow errors that are our fault, but not errors\nthat would be God\u2019s fault. On occasions when my\nperception is clear and distinct, my assent is involuntary and thus\nnot a result of a misuse of my free will. In such cases,\nassent is a necessary consequence of my cognitive nature \u2013 a\npoint made in many passages, as we\u2019ve seen: \u201cour mind is\nof such a nature that it cannot help assenting to what it clearly\nunderstands\u201d (AT 3:64, CSMK 147). Since, on occasions of clarity\nand distinctness, my assent is the unavoidable consequence of my\nGod-given cognitive nature, God would properly get the blame if those\njudgments resulted in error. Therefore, they are not in error; indeed\nthey could not be. That an evil genius might have created me\ncasts doubt on my clear and distinct judgments. That, instead, an\nall-perfect God created me guarantees that these judgments are true. A\nclever strategy of argument thus unfolds \u2013 effectively inverting\nthe usual reasoning in the problem of evil:\n\nI am the creation of an all-perfect God.\nThat I am the creation of an all-perfect God is incompatible with\nthe sceptical hypothesis that I am in error about what I clearly and\ndistinctly perceive.\nTherefore, I am not in error about what I clearly and distinctly\nperceive.\n\n\nThe first premise is argued in the Third Meditation. The second\npremise arises from the discussion of the Fourth Meditation. The\nresult is a divine guarantee of the C&D Rule. Whatever I perceive\nclearly and distinctly is guaranteed true, because I am the creature\nof an all-perfect God.\n\nIt might seem that, by the end of the Fourth Meditation, \nDescartes\u2019 broader case to overcome radical doubt is complete. \nAt that stage, the meditator is in position to reproduce a \ndemonstration \u2013 each step of which he clearly and distinctly \nperceives \u2013 which supports the grand conclusion that he\u2019s\nthe creation of an all-perfect God who would not allow him to be \nmistaken about whatever he perceives clearly and distinctly. However,\nthere are significant issues that must be addressed. Among the\nphilosophical concerns is that the demonstration itself looks \nsuspiciously circular \u2013 the so-called Cartesian Circle. A\nfurther issue arises in connection with the interpretation we\nhave been developing: for when the meditator is no longer clearly\nand distinctly perceiving the steps of the demonstration, the\ngrand conclusion can then be undermined by means of the Evil Genius\nDoubt; i.e., it would seem that perfect knowledge is not yet within\nthe meditator\u2019s grasp. Perhaps related is that at the close\nof the Fourth Meditation one finds no announcement of victory over\nthe Evil Genius Doubt; instead, the announcement comes at the end\nof the Fifth Meditation. But why? It is to such issues that we\nnow turn.\n\n",
