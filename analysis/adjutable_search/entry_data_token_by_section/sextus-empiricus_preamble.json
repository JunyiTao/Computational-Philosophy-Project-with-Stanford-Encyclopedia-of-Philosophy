    "main_text": "\n\n\nSextus Empiricus was a Pyrrhonian Skeptic living probably in the\nsecond or third century CE, many of whose works survive, including the\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism, the best and fullest account we have\nof Pyrrhonian skepticism (a kind of skepticism named for Pyrrho (see\nentry on Ancient Skepticism)). \n Pyrrhonian skepticism involves having no beliefs\nabout philosophical, scientific, or theoretical matters\u2014and\naccording to some interpreters, no beliefs at all, period. Whereas\nmodern skepticism questions the possibility of knowledge, Pyrrhonian\nskepticism questions the rationality of belief: the Pyrrhonian skeptic\nhas the skill of finding for every argument an equal and opposing\nargument, a skill whose employment will bring about suspension of\njudgment on any issue which is considered by the skeptic, and\nultimately, tranquillity.\n",
