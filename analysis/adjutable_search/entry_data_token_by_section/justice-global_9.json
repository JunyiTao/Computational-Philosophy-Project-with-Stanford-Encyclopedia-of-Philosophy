    "main_text": "The Proper Use of Force, Military Intervention, and its Aftermath || Humanitarian Intervention\n3.2 Humanitarian Intervention\n\nUnder what conditions, if any, may we engage in military intervention\naimed at stopping genocide? In recent years this issue has become\nsalient as large-scale human rights violations and suffering unfolded\nin Rwanda, the Sudan, the former Yugoslavia, and Libya. Against the\ntraditional understanding that respecting state sovereignty requires\nnon-interference, successful arguments were marshaled that there are\nimportant responsibilities to protect the vulnerable (International\nCommission on Intervention and State Sovereignty 2001). Leaning\nheavily on the conventional conditions contained in the just war\nframework, the International Commission on Intervention and State\nSovereignty argued that we may engage in war aimed at protecting those\nwho suffer at the hands of governments unwilling or unable to stop\nlarge-scale human rights abuses. The commission produced an\ninfluential report \u201cThe Responsibility to Protect\u201d which\nwas accepted by the United Nations in 2005, and the principles\ncontained in the report have guided decisions about cases, such as\nLibya in 2011 and Syria in 2012. One frequently voiced concern about\nhumanitarian interventions is whether they are just another form of\nimperialism. How will interveners be held accountable for their\nactions? Taking such concerns seriously Allen Buchanan and Robert\nKeohane advocate for a series of innovative mechanisms of\naccountability, both before and after the proposed intervention takes\nplace, to allay fears about abuse (Buchanan and Keohane 2004).\n",
