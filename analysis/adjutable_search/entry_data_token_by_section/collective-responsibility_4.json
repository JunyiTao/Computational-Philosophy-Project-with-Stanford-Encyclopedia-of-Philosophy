Alternative Approaches to Collective Responsibility\n\nMoral Responsibility has traditionally been understood to entail\nmoral\u2014and not just social or legal\u2014blameworthiness and\nmoral blameworthiness has, during the modern period, been understood\nto be an aspect of an individual\u2019s own moral agency rather than\na judgment that we ourselves make on the basis of our own social and\nlegal standards. Hence, those who search for the conditions of moral\nresponsibility generally insist that an agent has herself\ncaused\u2014freely willed\u2014that for which she is being held\nmorally responsible. Marion Smiley (1992) argues that this has not\nalways been the case but is rather a modern development.\n\nNot surprisingly, the kind of free will that is required of the modern\nnotion of moral responsibility\u2014contra-causal freedom\u2014is\ndifficult if not impossible to locate in practice. So, too, is the\n\u201csofter\u201d notion of free will preferred by\ncompatibilitists. Hence, when contemporary philosophers turn their\nattention to the conditions of moral responsibility in practice, they\nfrequently zero in on what they take to be one of free will\u2019s\nkey components\u2014intentionality\u2014and ask: Under what\nconditions can we say that an agent intended X?\n\nSmiley (1992) argues that having an intention is neither equivalent to\nfree will nor sufficient to ground the modern notion of moral\nresponsibility (as distinct from its Aristotelian counterpart).\nSuffice it to point out here that contemporary philosophers who write\nabout collective responsibility place intentionality at the center of\ntheir attention and because they have accepted (consciously or\nunconsciously) the modern notion of moral responsibility, they\nassociate it with a unified moral self that is capable of controlling\noutcomes.\n\nBut, as we have seen in Section 2, such a unified moral self might not\nbe possible in the case of collective entities. Where, then, does that\nleave us? Critics of collective responsibility assume that if such a\nunified moral self is not possible in the case of collective entities,\ncollective moral responsibility does not make sense. But such an\nassumption may be premature and in the end not warranted. For, if we\nwere to develop an alternative notion of collective moral\nresponsibility, i.e., one that does not attempt to mimic its (modern)\nindividualist counterpart, we might not have to insist on such a\nunified moral self. What might such an alternative notion of\ncollective moral responsibility look like?\n\nThree things suggest that we have a lot more creative freedom in this\ncontext than we now realize. First of all, contrary to the assumptions\nof many contemporary philosophers, the modern notion of moral\nresponsibility is not moral responsibility per se. Instead,\nit is a distinctly Kantian notion of moral responsibility that has at\nleast a trio of respectable counterparts, namely, the Aristotelian,\nChristian, and pragmatist notions of moral responsibility (Smiley\n1992).\n\nSecond, while many contemporary moral philosophers may in the end\nprefer the Kantian notion, we cannot dismiss these others simply\nbecause they do not live up to Kantian standards. Nor, for that\nmatter, can we designate these other notions of moral responsibility\nas non-moral or as \u201cmerely sociological\u201d simply because\nthey do not conform to what Kantians see as \u201cthe moral\nrealm\u201d. Instead, we have to make room for the above notions of\nmoral responsibility\u2014and perhaps others still\u2014in our\ndiscussions of collective responsibility.\n\nThird, given its association with discrete individuals, the Kantian\nunderstanding of moral responsibility would seem to be especially out\nof place when it comes to collective responsibility. For, moral\nresponsibility as Kantians understood it is not something that we just\nhappen to associate with individual moral agents. Nor is its\nnotion of moral blameworthiness just incidentally applied to\nindividuals. Instead, moral responsibility as put forward by Kantians\nis by nature associated with individual moral agents. So,\ntoo, is the notion of moral blameworthiness that grounds it. Indeed,\nthe latter is best defined as individual moral\nblameworthiness.\n\nAll three points should be liberating for those who want to re-think\ncollective responsibility in ways that render it both possible and\nappropriate to groups. The first suggests that there are other notions\nof moral responsibility available to us. The second makes clear that\nthese other notions of moral responsibility cannot be dismissed simply\nbecause they do not conform to the Kantian notion of morality. The\nthird points to the need to move beyond what is by definition a notion\nof individual moral blameworthiness and to figure out how\ngroups might be understood as morally blameworthy qua\ngroups.\n\nWhat might it mean for groups to be morally blameworthy? What kind of\ncausation would be required to sustain a notion of group moral\nblameworthiness? How might we put these two things\u2014group moral\nblameworthiness and causation\u2014together in this context to\nconstitute an alternative way of thinking about collective\nresponsibility that is both possible and appropriate to groups?\n\nIn recent years, a small group of moral philosophers has begun to ask\nthese questions and in doing so has provided us with intriguing\nalternatives to the traditional understanding of moral responsibility.\nIn his own re-thinking of collective responsibility, Kenneth Shockley\n(2007 and 2016) sets out to replace the Kantian notion of moral\nblameworthiness with a looser notion of \u201cbeing at fault\u201d\nthat allows us to talk about a particular collective as\n\u201cdeserving of some kind of punishment apart from that meted out\nto its members for their role in harm\u201d (p. 452). Such punishment\nmight mean \u201ceradicating the groups themselves or dismantling\npart of them. Likewise, it might take the form of reducing the\nstrength of bonds between individual members or \u2026\nde-institutionalizing group norms\u201d (p. 452).\n\nNeta Crawford (2007, 2013 and 2014), who also distances herself from\nthe Kantian notion of moral blameworthiness, points to the importance\nof recognizing that collectives, as distinct from their members, can\ndo morally bad things\u2014in some cases through the actions of their\nmembers\u2014by virtue of the particular kind of group that they are\nand how they are organized. Crawford\u2019s particular concern here\nis with military groups whose soldiers end up killing innocents as a\nresult of either their rules of engagement or the kinds of weapons\nthat they use. What sense does it make to say that such military\ngroups, as distinct from their members, are morally blameworthy for\nthe deaths of these innocents?\n\nCrawford argues that while it makes no sense to consider a military\ngroup morally guilty in the sense of having a tainted soul, it does\nmake sense to consider that it is in at least some respects a morally\nbad organization that deserves punishment. Not surprisingly, such\npunishment has to be appropriate to organizations, as distinct from\nindividuals, if it is going to ground collective moral responsibility.\nHence, Crawford chooses to view punishment here as a matter of forcing\na collective to apologize, make amends, and change.\n\nThe \u201cchange\u201d here frequently amounts to either eradicating\nparts of the group in question or changing those aspects of the group\nthat lead it to produce harm. In the case of a morally blameworthy\nmilitary group, it means \u201creducing the likelihood of systematic\natrocities and avoidable accidents by reviewing and revising the\nchoice of weapons and rules of engagement \u2026 and apologizing and\nmaking amends when systematic atrocity occurs\u201d (Crawford 2007,\np. 212).\n\nIn other cases, the punishment associated with a morally blameworthy\ncollective may amount to eradicating the group altogether or to\nforcing it to give up important aspects of itself. The Nazi\nregime\u2014or any other regime whose purpose is to destroy a race of\npersons\u2014would presumably fall into the first camp. A government\nor business club that excludes persons of color and/or women as part\nof its raison d\u2019etre would presumably fall into the second.\n\nWhat kind of causation or agency is required by moral blameworthiness\nof this kind? Since we are not talking about a Kantian notion of moral\nblameworthiness, we do not have to go as far as to insist on free will\nor focus all of our attention on the possibility of a unified moral\nself. Nor as such do we have to make sense of a group\u2019s having\nfreely willed something bad. But, unless we want to ground moral\nblameworthiness in pure utility, we do have to assume, at the very\nleast, that the collective in question has produced the\nharm.\n\nNot surprisingly, not just any kind of production will do here. At the\nvery least, the collective has to play what Shockley (2007) calls an\n\u201celiminable role\u201d in the production of harm\u2014even if\nthat role is primarily one of providing the conditions under which\nmembers of the collective carry out the harmful actions. In other\nwords, the collective has to be necessary to the harm\u2019s\nproduction by virtue of what Shockley calls its \u201ccoordinating\ncontrol\u201d over members.\n\nHow can we understand such control? In the case of corporations, we\ncan focus on the way in which the norms of the collective determine or\nshape particular paths of behavior, as well as on how incentive\nstructures and patterns of discipline lead individuals to act in\nharmful ways. Shockley finds many of these things at work in the case\nof Enron. According to him, \u201c[t]he norms operative within the\nmembership of Enron controlled for the climate of secrecy and\ndoubt\u201d (Shockley 2007, p. 449).\n\nShockley assumes here that the collective is morally responsible for\nharm because it exerts \u201ccoordinating control\u201d over what\nhappens in the group. But he does not excuse individual members from\nmoral blameworthiness in the process. Nor, for that matter, does he\nallow for the possibility that individual members may together bring\nabout harm without having acted in a morally blameworthy fashion\nthemselves. Indeed, he insists on individual members having acted as\nsuch if collective moral responsibility is to be coherent. In cases\nwhere collectives are morally responsible for harm, \u201cthe\ncollective serves as an enabling condition of individual blameworthy\nagents to perform harmful acts\u201d (Shockley 2007, p. 442).\n\nShockley is wise to point out that the moral responsibility of a\ncollective does not preclude the moral responsibility of its members.\nBut he may go too far in including the moral blameworthiness of\nindividual members in collective moral responsibility itself. For,\nthere are\u2014even according to Shockley\u2019s own criteria of\ncoordinating control\u2014cases of collective moral responsibility in\nwhich individuals either do nothing wrong but together bring about\nharm within a collective or do harmful things but are excused from\nmoral blameworthiness by virtue of their inability to do otherwise.\nMobs are a case of the first kind. Neta Crawford\u2019s soldiers are\na case of the second.\n\nMoreover, as argued in Smiley 2010, if we are truly concerned about\ncollective moral responsibility, rather than about the moral\nresponsibility of individuals who belong to collectives, we do not\nhave to insist that individual members have performed actions that\nrender them morally blameworthy. Instead, we have to insist only that\nthe collective, by virtue of its very nature as the particular kind of\ncollective that it is, has led individual members to produce harm that\nthey could not have produced themselves. For, it is the moral\nblameworthiness of the collective itself, rather than that of its\nmembers, that constitutes collective moral responsibility.\n\nWhile associating collectives with moral blameworthiness is difficult,\nit is not, as we have seen, impossible. Indeed, by both reimagining\nmoral blameworthiness in the context of groups and developing\nalternative notions of collective agency that allow us to locate such\nmoral blameworthiness, we can move toward a coherent and empirically\nfeasible practice of collective moral responsibility. Two recent\nefforts to defend collective moral responsibility appear to be\nparticularly promising in this context. The first involves\nappropriating P. F. Strawson\u2019s reactive attitudes model of moral\nblameworthiness for the purpose of showing how a collective might be\nconstrued as morally blameworthy qua collective. Gunnar\nBjornsson and Kendy Hess (2017) pick up on Strawson\u2019s approach\nin their own work on collective moral responsibility and ask whether\ncorporations and other collective entities can have the requisite\nreactive attitudes to be held morally responsible for bringing about\nharm. They answer in the affirmative and argue that collective\nentities can have the capacities associated with guilt and\nindignation, as well as the relevant epistemic and motivational\ncapacities to be blamed.\n\nThe second effort zeros in on the motivational capacities of groups\nassociated with reason-giving. Here the argument is that while\ncollectives may not have the kind of free will associated with\nindividual moral agents, they do have the capacity to formulate\nreasons and act on them. Silver (2022) argues that it is this capacity\nto respond to one\u2019s reasons and to be motivated by them that\nrenders collectives self-directed in a way that lends credence to our\nascriptions of collective moral responsibility to them.\n\nPresumably, not all groups which are appropriate sites of moral\nresponsibility should be blamed. How, if at all, can groups\nwhich are appropriate sites of collective moral responsibility, in\ngeneral, avoid blame in particular cases? While, as Andr\u00e9s\nGarcia (2021) argues, collective moral responsibility is not itself\ninherently unfair in ways that early critics such as H. D. Lewis\n(1948) claimed, it can be unfair in particular cases. In some of these\ncases, its unfairness will be a matter of a group\u2019s not having\nmade a sufficient contribution to the harm for which it is being\nblamed. In other cases, it will be a matter of the group\u2019s not\nhaving known what was going on. In these latter cases, we confront the\npossibility that the group can make a plea of ignorance to avoid blame\nin the way that individuals do. A plea that as Smiley (2016) points\nout, needs to be assessed with various standards of fairness in\nmind.\n\nNot surprisingly, the possibility of group-based ignorance is itself\ncontroversial. Anne Schwenkenbecher (2021) articulates several\ndifferent kinds of group-based ignorance and goes on to argue for\ncollective epistemic obligations. S\u00e4de Hormio (2018) explores how\ngroup-based ignorance is structured, as well as maintained, within\norganizations and provides us with a framework for distinguishing\nbetween acceptable and unacceptable excuses in the context of\ngroup-based blame. While such efforts face the same kinds of\nchallenges faced by all efforts that treat groups as moral agents,\nthey signal the possibility of yet another alternative approach to\ncollective moral responsibility (and a very promising one at that) by\ntreating collective moral responsibility as at least shaped, if not\ndesignated by worldly practices such as excuse-giving,\n",
