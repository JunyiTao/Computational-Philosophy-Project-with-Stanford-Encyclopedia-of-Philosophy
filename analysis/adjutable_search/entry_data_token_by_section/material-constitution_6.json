    "main_text": "Relative Identity\n7. Deflationism\n\nImagine a debate between two friends over whether or not boats are\nships. One party points to a rowboat and says, \u201cThat boat is a\nship. After all, a ship is a vessel that floats on water and the\nrowboat is obviously a vessel that floats on water.\u201d The second\nparty disagrees: \u201cA ship is a sufficiently large vessel\nthat floats on water and the rowboat is not sufficiently large. So the\nboat is not a ship.\u201d Clearly, there is something defective about\nthis debate. First, there are two \u201ccandidate meanings\u201d for\nthe predicate \u2018ship\u2019\u2014namely a vessel that floats\non water and a sufficiently large vessel that floats on\nwater. Second, neither of these candidate meanings is more\n\u201cnatural\u201d than the other\u2014unlike \u2018water\u2019\nor \u2018electron\u2019, the predicate \u2018ship\u2019 does not\ncorrespond to a natural kind in the world. Third, the two parties to\nthe debate agree on all of the \u201cnon-ship\u201d facts\u2014in\nparticular, both parties agree that the rowboat is a vessel, that it\nfloats on water, and that it is relatively small in size. Given these\npoints, it is tempting to say that the two parties agree on all of the\nfacts and that their dispute is merely verbal. Note\nthat this conclusion is consistent with the view that one of the\nparties is actually mistaken. Suppose, for example, that semantic\nexternalism is correct and the meanings of our terms are\ndetermined, in part, by overall use (see the entry on\n externalism about mental content).\n In that case, the first party to our debate is presumably mistaken,\nsince English-speakers do not use the term \u2018ship\u2019 for rowboats. Still,\nthere is a sense in which the debate is verbal, for there is a\npossible language (\u201cEnglish*\u201d) that (a) employs a\ndifferent, equally natural meaning for \u2018ship\u2019, (b) is\nadequate for describing all of the facts, and (c) is such that the\nfirst party\u2019s statements would be true in that language. Thus,\nwe might say that the real dispute between the two parties is over\nwhether or not English is English*. And that is clearly a verbal\ndispute.\n\nSome philosophers have suggested that the debate over material\nconstitution is defective in exactly the same way. There is no genuine\ndispute between Lewis and Unger, for example, over whether or not\nstatues exist. Both parties agree on all of the relevant\nfacts\u2014e.g., that there are simples arranged statuewise. And both\nparties agree that there are two possible languages\n(\u201cLewis-English\u201d and \u201cUnger-English\u201d) where\nthe sentence \u201cStatues exist\u201d comes out true in one and\nfalse in the other. So the only disagreement is over whether English\nis Lewis-English or Unger-English. In other words, the debate is\nmerely verbal. This kind of deflationist view is often\nassociated with Rudolf Carnap (1950), Hilary Putnam (1987) and, more\nrecently, Eli Hirsch (2002a, 2002b, 2005). The issues raised by\ndeflationism are extremely complicated; here, we will limit ourselves\nto a few initial observations. (For a longer introduction to these\nissues, see Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman 2009. For an extended\ndefense of deflationism, see Thomasson 2015.)\n\nIn the imagined dispute, we know exactly what the disputed term is\n(\u2018ship\u2019) and exactly what the relevant candidate meanings\nare (a vessel that floats on water and a sufficiently\nlarge vessel that floats on water). In the actual dispute between\nLewis and Unger, matters are not so clear. One might suspect that the\ndisputed term in this case is the predicate \u2018statue\u2019, but\nit turns out to be fairly difficult to specify the relevant candidate\nmeanings. For example, we might say that, in Lewis-English,\n\u2018statue\u2019 simply means a collection of simples arranged\nstatuewise. Whether or not that is a plausible interpretation of\nwhat Lewis means depends in part on the meaning of\n\u2018collection\u2019 (Sider 2009, pp. 388\u201390). In any case,\nit is even more difficult to specify an appropriate candidate meaning\nfor \u2018statue\u2019 in Unger-English. More importantly, even if\nwe are able to specify the relevant candidate meanings, we will not\nhave succeeded in showing that the general dispute between Lewis and\nUnger is verbal, for the dispute can be brought out without using the\npredicate \u2018statue\u2019 (or any non-logical predicate, for that\nmatter). Consider, for example, a world that contains one-million\nsimples arranged statuewise and nothing else. And consider the\nnumerical sentence (see section 4) which asserts the existence of at\nleast one-million and one things. Lewis and Unger will disagree over\nthe truth of that sentence. But that sentence contains only logical\nvocabulary. Hence, if the two parties are really talking past each\nother, then they must assign different meanings to one or more of the\nlogical constants.\n\nThe most plausible suggestion is that Lewis and Unger assign (or, at\nleast, intend to assign) different meanings to the existential\nquantifier, \u2018\u2203\u2019 (as well as quantificational phrases\nlike \u2018there are\u2019, \u2018there is\u2019, and\n\u2018some\u2019). And, indeed, this is where deflationists have\nfocused their attention. Putnam, for example, writes that \u201c[T]he\nlogical primitives themselves, and in particular the notions of object\nand existence, have a multitude of different uses rather than one\nabsolute \u2018meaning\u2019\u2009\u201d (1987, p. 71). This\nthesis\u2014that there are many meanings for the existential\nquantifier that are equally natural and equally adequate for\ndescribing all the facts\u2014is often referred to as \u201cthe\ndoctrine of quantifier variance\u201d (Hirsch 2002b). What exactly\nare the candidate meanings in question? Once again, matters are not so\nclear. Lewis could, of course, simply interpret Unger to be using a\nrestricted quantifier that ranges only over simples. On that\ninterpretation, Unger speaks truthfully when he utters the sentence\n\u201cStatues do not exist\u201d, since there are no statues among the simples.\nThe problem with this interpretation is that it seems manifestly\nimplausible, given that Unger will insist that his quantifiers are to\nbe understood as unrestricted. Even more worrying is the question of\nhow Unger is supposed to interpret Lewis. He cannot, for example, say\nthat Lewis is using a less restrictive quantifier, for that would be\nto say that there are things (that Lewis\u2019s quantifier ranges\nover) that do not exist (by Unger\u2019s own lights). Unger could,\nperhaps, take a more holistic approach and interpret Lewis\u2019s\nassertion of \u2018Statues exist\u2019 to mean there are some simples\narranged statuewise. More generally, Unger could interpret Lewis\nby replacing singular quantifiers over composites with plural\nquantifiers over simples, and by replacing each predicate of\ncomposites with an irreducibly plural predicate of simples. Once\nagain, we should expect protest\u2014Lewis will reject the proposed\ntranslation and insist that he is using singular quantification when\nhe asserts the sentence \u2018Statues exist\u2019.\n\nThese initial observations bring out one disanalogy between the\nontological dispute and paradigm verbal disputes. In the earlier\nargument over whether or not boats are ships, the proposed\ntranslations are friendly, since the first party will admit\nthat he uses \u2018ship\u2019 to mean a vessel that floats on\nwater and the second will grant that he uses \u2018ship\u2019\nto mean a sufficiently large vessel that floats on water.\nGiven this disambiguation, the dispute will evaporate. The\ndeflationist\u2019s proposals are instead hostile, for\nneither Lewis nor Unger will accept the deflationist interpretation\noffered by his opponent (Sider 2009, section 5). This does not mean\nthat the ontologists\u2019 debate is non-verbal, but it does mean\nthat the issues involved here are more complicated than those in\nparadigm verbal disputes.
