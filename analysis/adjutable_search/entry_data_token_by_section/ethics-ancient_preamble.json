    "main_text": "\n\nWhile moral theory does not invent morality, or even reflection on it,\nit does try to bring systematic thinking to bear on these activities.\nAncient moral theory, however, does not attempt to be a comprehensive\naccount of all the phenomena that fall under the heading of morality.\nRather, assuming piecemeal opinions and practices, it tries to capture\nits underlying essence. It is the nature of such an enterprise to\nevaluate and criticize some of these opinions and practices but that\nis not its primary goal. Ancient moral theory tries to provide a\nreflective account of an essential human activity so one can grasp\nwhat is of fundamental importance in pursuing it. In historical order,\nthe theories to be considered in this article are those of Socrates as\npresented in certain dialogues of Plato; Plato in the\nRepublic; Aristotle; the Cynics; Cyrenaic hedonism; Epicurus;\nthe Stoics; and Pyrrhonian skepticism.\n",
