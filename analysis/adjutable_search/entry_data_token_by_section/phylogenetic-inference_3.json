    "main_text": "Phylogenetic Inference and Philosophy || Alignment and Character Coding\n2.1 Alignment and Character Coding\n\nThe question of which method of phylogenetic inference is best\njustified is clearly important, but skips over an important step in\nphylogenetic inference\u2014the construction of a data matrix of\ncharacters. Mishler (2005), for one, argues that it is the most\nimportant step! Following Winther (2009), we can separate\ncharacter analysis which results in the construction of a\ndata matrix from phylogenetic analysis which treats the data\nas input and produces a phylogeny. This first stage of character\nanalysis has been widely discussed in biology (though surely less\nwidely discussed than the second stage). In addition to the voluminous\nliterature on homology, useful collections of work on characters\ninclude those edited by Wagner (2000) and Scotland & Pennington\n(2000).\n\nCharacter analysis includes identifying characters of the organisms we\nare looking at, and in particular, identifying when a character in one\norganism is the same character as in another organism. This is the\nproblem of homology. A different, but related problem, is assigning\ncharacter states. For example, one bear might have black fur while\nanother has white fur. Here, \u201cfur\u201d is the character, but\nit is in a different state (fur color) in the two organisms. Though it\nis standard to treat characters and character states separately, the\nextent to which these are genuinely different problems rather than\nthan aspects of the same problem is a matter of debate (Stevens 2000;\nFreudenstein 2005; Sereno 2005).\n\nIdentifying and coding characters is certainly a biological problem,\nbut it is a philosophical one as well. On what basis can we judge that\none character is homologous to another? Debates on this extend back to\nthe very beginning of contemporary biology, e.g., Richard Owen\u2019s\ninfluential pre-Darwinian notion of homologue to Ernst Haeckel working\nto develop accounts of homology in the context of Darwinian evolution.\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the pheneticists argued that character\nidentification must be \u201ctheory-free\u201d and advocated using\nraw similarity as a guide to identifying homology (Sokal & Sneath\n1963; Sneath & Sokal 1973). There are well known philosophical and\nbiological problems with trying to use similarity in this way (e.g.,\nGoodman 1972), many of which were raised as objections to strict\npheneticism during the Systematics Wars (e.g., Mayr 1965b; Neff 1986;\nRieppel & Kearney 2002 though see Lewens 2012 for a recent defense\nof pheneticism in a contemporary context).\n\nIn a phylogenetic context, homologies are regarded as the result of\ndescent with modification from common ancestors. Similarity and\nidentity, in that context, is an expression of shared evolutionary\nhistory. At the same time, homologies are also treated as hypotheses\nfrom which we can infer phylogenetic hypotheses (and, subsequently,\nboth test and explain our hypotheses of homology). Clearly, even in a\ncontemporary phylogenetic context, questions remain on how to\nindividuate characters and identify homologies. Richards (2002, 2003)\nworries that since there is no algorithm for individuating characters,\nwe rely on illegitimate, nonscientific factors rendering character\nidentification and phylogenetic analysis ultimately subjective.\nRieppel and Kearney (2007) and Winther (2009) respond that character\nanalysis can be considered objective since it relies on various kinds\nof causal criteria; Kendig (2016) adopts a slightly different\nstrategy, rejecting the idea that we need to develop an analytic\ndefinition of \u201chomology\u201d, instead looking to biological\npractice as a guide for individuating characters.\n\nWhile character analysis and phylogenetic analysis are logically\nseparate tasks, in theory they should be intertwined. A given\nphylogeny can make an assessment of homology more or less plausible.\nOne proposal to avoid this problem is the introduction of a\ndistinction between \u201cprimary\u201d homologies (an initial\ncharacter identification based on structural features) and\n\u201csecondary\u201d homologies (similarity due to common ancestry)\nwhich are inferred through phylogenetic analysis (Pinna 1991; see\nRoffe 2020 for a recent philosophical treatment of this distinction).\nOn the other hand, Rieppel and Kearney (2002) argue that character\nhypotheses need to be independently testable and phylogenetic analysis\ncan clearly provide evidence for miscoding of characters\u2014even if\nthis is not the intended goal.\n\nMolecular data presents a different set of challenges for\nindividuating characters and coding them into a matrix, nicely\nillustrated by DNA sequence data. With only four base nucleotides,\ncoding is easy\n (\u00a71.2.3),\n and modern laboratory techniques provide highly reliable sequences of\nnucleotides in a stretch of DNA. But here, the problem is\nalignment. How do we know that one stretch of nucleotide\nsequences should correspond to similar stretches in other taxa? We\nmight consider chromosomal location, or even functional similarities,\nthough each of these raise other questions of how we decide what ought\nto be treated as homologous characters (even contingently) across\ntaxa. This becomes even more complicated as we consider how historical\nprocesses like gene duplication/loss or recombination add complexity\nto these questions. This is the problem of positional homology. Like\nmorphological character coding, molecular alignment is intertwined\nwith phylogenetic analysis and various methods of joint inference have\nbeen proposed (Redelings & Suchard 2005; Wheeler et al. 2006).\n",
