Actual vs. Expected Consequentialisms\n\nA second set of problems for classic utilitarianism is\nepistemological. Classic utilitarianism seems to require that agents\ncalculate all consequences of each act for every person for all time.\nThat\u2019s impossible.\n\nThis objection rests on a misinterpretation. These critics assume that\nthe principle of utility is supposed to be used as a decision\nprocedure or guide, that is, as a method that agents\nconsciously apply to acts in advance to help them make decisions.\nHowever, most classic and contemporary utilitarians and\nconsequentialists do not propose their principles as decision\nprocedures. (Bales 1971) Bentham wrote, \u201cIt is not to be\nexpected that this process [his hedonic calculus] should be strictly\npursued previously to every moral judgment.\u201d (1789, Chap. IV,\nSec. VI) Mill agreed, \u201cit is a misapprehension of the\nutilitarian mode of thought to conceive it as implying that people\nshould fix their minds upon so wide a generality as the world, or\nsociety at large.\u201d (1861, Chap. II, Par. 19) Sidgwick added,\n\u201cIt is not necessary that the end which gives the criterion of\nrightness should always be the end at which we consciously aim.\u201d\n(1907, 413)\n\nInstead, most consequentialists claim that overall utility is the\ncriterion or standard of what is morally right or\nmorally ought to be done. Their theories are intended to spell out the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for an act to be morally right,\nregardless of whether the agent can tell in advance whether those\nconditions are met. Just as the laws of physics govern golf ball\nflight, but golfers need not calculate physical forces while planning\nshots; so overall utility can determine which decisions are morally\nright, even if agents need not calculate utilities while making\ndecisions. If the principle of utility is used as a criterion of the\nright rather than as a decision procedure, then classical\nutilitarianism does not require that anyone know the total\nconsequences of anything before making a decision.\n\nFurthermore, a utilitarian criterion of right implies that it would\nnot be morally right to use the principle of utility as a decision\nprocedure in cases where it would not maximize utility to try to\ncalculate utilities before acting. Utilitarians regularly argue that\nmost people in most circumstances ought not to try to calculate\nutilities, because they are too likely to make serious miscalculations\nthat will lead them to perform actions that reduce utility. It is even\npossible to hold that most agents usually ought to follow their moral\nintuitions, because these intuitions evolved to lead us to perform\nacts that maximize utility, at least in likely circumstances (Hare\n1981, 46\u201347). Some utilitarians (Sidgwick 1907, 489\u201390)\nsuggest that a utilitarian decision procedure may be adopted as an\nesoteric morality by an elite group that is better at calculating\nutilities, but utilitarians can, instead, hold that nobody should use\nthe principle of utility as a decision procedure.\n\nThis move is supposed to make consequentialism self-refuting,\naccording to some opponents. However, there is nothing incoherent\nabout proposing a decision procedure that is separate from one\u2019s\ncriterion of the right. Similar distinctions apply in other normative\nrealms. The criterion of a good stock investment is its total return,\nbut the best decision procedure still might be to reduce risk by\nbuying an index fund or blue-chip stocks. Criteria can, thus, be\nself-effacing without being self-refuting (Parfit 1984, chs. 1 and\n4).\n\nOthers object that this move takes the force out of consequentialism,\nbecause it leads agents to ignore consequentialism when they make real\ndecisions. However, a criterion of the right can be useful at a higher\nlevel by helping us choose among available decision procedures and\nrefine our decision procedures as circumstances change and we gain\nmore experience and knowledge. Hence, most consequentialists do not\nmind giving up consequentialism as a direct decision procedure as long\nas consequences remain the criterion of rightness (but see Chappell\n2001).\n\nIf overall utility is the criterion of moral rightness, then it might\nseem that nobody could know what is morally right. If so, classical\nutilitarianism leads to moral skepticism. However, utilitarians insist\nthat we can have strong reasons to believe that certain acts reduce\nutility, even if we have not yet inspected or predicted every\nconsequence of those acts. For example, in normal circumstances, if\nsomeone were to torture and kill his children, it is possible that\nthis would maximize utility, but that is very unlikely. Maybe they\nwould have grown up to be mass murders, but it is at least as likely\nthat they would grow up to cure serious diseases or do other great\nthings, and it is much more likely that they would have led normally\nhappy (or at least not destructive) lives. So observers as well as\nagents have adequate reasons to believe that such acts are morally\nwrong, according to act utilitarianism. In many other cases, it will\nstill be hard to tell whether an act will maximize utility, but that\nshows only that there are severe limits to our knowledge of what is\nmorally right. That should be neither surprising nor problematic for\nutilitarians.\n\nIf utilitarians want their theory to allow more moral knowledge, they\ncan make a different kind of move by turning from actual consequences\nto expected or expectable consequences. Suppose that Alice finds a\nrunaway teenager who asks for money to get home. Alice wants to help\nand reasonably believes that buying a bus ticket home for this runaway\nwill help, so she buys a bus ticket and puts the runaway on the bus.\nUnfortunately, the bus is involved in a freak accident, and the\nrunaway is killed. If actual consequences are what determine moral\nwrongness, then it was morally wrong for Alice to buy the bus ticket\nfor this runaway. Opponents claim that this result is absurd enough to\nrefute classic utilitarianism.\n\nSome utilitarians bite the bullet and say that Alice\u2019s act was\nmorally wrong, but it was blameless wrongdoing, because her motives\nwere good, and she was not responsible, given that she could not have\nforeseen that her act would cause harm. Since this theory makes actual\nconsequences determine moral rightness, it can be called actual\nconsequentialism.\n\nOther responses claim that moral rightness depends on foreseen,\nforeseeable, intended, or likely consequences, rather than actual\nones. Imagine that Bob does not in fact foresee a bad consequence that\nwould make his act wrong if he did foresee it, but that Bob could\neasily have foreseen this bad consequence if he had been paying\nattention. Maybe he does not notice the rot on the hamburger he feeds\nto his kids which makes them sick. If foreseen consequences\nare what matter, then Bob\u2019s act is not morally wrong. If\nforeseeable consequences are what matter, then Bob\u2019s\nact is morally wrong, because the bad consequences were foreseeable.\nNow consider Bob\u2019s wife, Carol, who notices that the meat is\nrotten but does not want to have to buy more, so she feeds it to her\nchildren anyway, hoping that it will not make them sick; but it does.\nCarol\u2019s act is morally wrong if foreseen or foreseeable\nconsequences are what matter, but not if what matter are\nintended consequences, because she does not intend to make\nher children sick. Finally, consider Bob and Carol\u2019s son Don,\nwho does not know enough about food to be able to know that eating\nrotten meat can make people sick. If Don feeds the rotten meat to his\nlittle sister, and it makes her sick, then the bad consequences are\nnot intended, foreseen, or even foreseeable by Don, but those bad\nresults are still objectively likely or probable,\nunlike the case of Alice. Some philosophers deny that probability can\nbe fully objective, but at least the consequences here are foreseeable\nby others who are more informed than Don can be at the time. For Don\nto feed the rotten meat to his sister is, therefore, morally wrong if\nlikely consequences are what matter, but not morally wrong if what\nmatter are foreseen or foreseeable or intended consequences.\n\nConsequentialist moral theories that focus on actual or objectively\nprobable consequences are often described as objective\nconsequentialism (Railton 1984). In contrast, consequentialist\nmoral theories that focus on intended or foreseen consequences are\nusually described as subjective consequentialism.\nConsequentialist moral theories that focus on reasonably foreseeable\nconsequences are then not subjective insofar as they do not depend on\nanything inside the actual subject\u2019s mind, but they are\nsubjective insofar as they do depend on which consequences this\nparticular subject would foresee if he or she were better informed or\nmore rational.\n\nOne final solution to these epistemological problems deploys the legal\nnotion of proximate cause. If consequentialists define consequences in\nterms of what is caused (unlike Sosa 1993), then which future events\ncount as consequences is affected by which notion of causation is used\nto define consequences. Suppose I give a set of steak knives to a\nfriend. Unforeseeably, when she opens my present, the decorative\npattern on the knives somehow reminds her of something horrible that\nher husband did. This memory makes her so angry that she voluntarily\nstabs and kills him with one of the knives. She would not have killed\nher husband if I had given her spoons instead of knives. Did my\ndecision or my act of giving her knives cause her husband\u2019s\ndeath? Most people (and the law) would say that the cause was her act,\nnot mine. Why? One explanation is that her voluntary act intervened in\nthe causal chain between my act and her husband\u2019s death.\nMoreover, even if she did not voluntarily kill him, but instead she\nslipped and fell on the knives, thereby killing herself, my gift would\nstill not be a cause of her death, because the coincidence of her\nfalling intervened between my act and her death. The point is that,\nwhen voluntary acts and coincidences intervene in certain causal\nchains, then the results are not seen as caused by the acts further\nback in the chain of necessary conditions (Hart and Honor\u00e9\n1985). Now, if we assume that an act must be such a proximate cause of\na harm in order for that harm to be a consequence of that act, then\nconsequentialists can claim that the moral rightness of that act is\ndetermined only by such proximate consequences. This position, which\nmight be called proximate consequentialism, makes it much\neasier for agents and observers to justify moral judgments of acts\nbecause it obviates the need to predict non-proximate consequences in\ndistant times and places. Hence, this move is worth considering, even\nthough it has never been developed as far as I know and deviates far\nfrom traditional consequentialism, which counts not only proximate\nconsequences but all upshots \u2014 that is, everything for which the\nact is a causally necessary condition.\n",
