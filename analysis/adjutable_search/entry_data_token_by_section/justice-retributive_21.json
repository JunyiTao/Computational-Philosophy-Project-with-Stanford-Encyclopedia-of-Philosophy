    "main_text": "The Question of Justification || Fairness and free riding\n5.2 Fairness and free riding\n\nArguably the most popular theoretical framework for justifying\nretributivism in the past fifty years or so has been Herbert Morris's\n(1968) appeal to fairness. The argument starts with the thought that it is to our mutual\nbenefit to live in society, and that to be in society, we have to\naccept certain limits on our behavior. It then continues with this claim:\n\n\nIf a person fails to exercise self-restraint even though he might\nhave\u2026 he renounces a burden which others have voluntarily\nassumed and thus gains an advantage which others, who have restrained\nthemselves, do not possess. (1968: 33)\n\n\nIt concludes with the thought that his unfair advantage should be erased by \u201cexacting the\ndebt\u201d (1968: 34). This is done with hard treatment.\n\nThough influential, the problems with this argument are serious. First,\nit is unclear that criminals have advantages that others have\nforsaken. Suppose someone murders another in a moment of anger,\ntriggered by a minor offense. Does he get the \u201cadvantage\u201d\nof getting to express his anger? What if most people feel they can\nexpress their anger sufficiently in such situations by expressing it\nin words? Then it seems that the only advantage he has is being able\nto express his anger violently. But if most people do not, at least\nnot upon reflection, wish to do that sort of thing, then he is not\nrenouncing a burden that others too wish to renounce.\n\nEven if there is some sense in which he gains an advantage over\nothers, such as the advantage of being free to use violence, what\nwould then be the proper measure of bringing him back in line? To see\nthe problem, compare how \u201cfar ahead\u201d such a murderer is\nlikely to get to how \u201cfar ahead\u201d someone might get by\neconomic fraud. Fraud may produce a much greater advantage, but we\nnormally think that violence is the greater crime. (Davis 1993\nchallenges this framing of the advantage gained, suggesting the right\ntest is the value a crime would find at an auction of licenses to\ncommit crimes; Shafer-Landau 1996: 303 rejects this solution as\nequally implausible.)\n\nMore problematically yet, it seems to be fundamentally missing the\npoint to say that the crime of, for example, murder is, at bottom,\nfree riding rather than unjustly killing another. (For these and\nrelated criticisms, see Braithwaite & Pettit 1990: 158\u2013159;\nDolinko 1991: 545\u2013549; Murphy 2007: 13\u201314.)\n\nAn alternative interpretation of Morris's idea is that the relevant\nbenefit is the opportunity to live in a relatively secure state, and\nthe wrong is not the gaining of an extra benefit but the failure to\naccept the burdens that, collectively, make that benefit possible.\nPunishment then removes the benefit that the wrongdoer cannot fairly\nlay claim to, having shirked the burden that it was her due to carry\n(see Westen 2016). This interpretation avoids the first of the\nproblems outlined above. But it still has difficulty accounting for\nthe thought that a crime such as murder is not fundamentally about\nfree riding. Moreover, it has difficulty accounting for proportional\npunishment in a plausible way. Presumably, the measure of a\nproportional punishment would be something like this: the greater the\nshirking of one's duty to accept the burdens of self-restraint, the\nlarger should be one's punishment. But how do we measure the degree of\nshirking? By the harm one causes or risks causing, by the benefit one\nreceives, or by the degree to which respecting the burden shirked\nwould have been burdensome? Only the first corresponds with a normal\nretributive notion of punishment, but this alternative reading seems\nto point to one of the latter two meanings as the measure of unjust\ngain. In addition, this view seems to imply that one who entered a\nsecure society from some sort of failed state, and who has not yet\nbenefited from the secure state, cannot be punished if she commits\nviolent criminal acts in the secure state. This is quite an odd\nimplication, though one that a social contract theorist might be\nwilling to accept.\n\nFor another attempt to develop a better Morris-like view, making the\nwrong the undermining of the conditions of trust, see Dimock 1997: 41.\nFor a criticism, see Korman 2003. For an attempt to build on Morris's\nidea, translating the basic wrong into flouting legitimate, democratic\nlaw, see Markel 2011.\n",
