    "main_text": "Intuition and Expression || The Double Ideality of the Work of Art\n4.1 The Double Ideality of the Work of Art\n\nFor our purposes, it is simplest to regard Croce as an idealist, for\nwhom there is nothing besides the mind. So in that sense, the work of\nart is an ideal or mental object along with everything else; no\nsurprise there, but no interest either. But he still maintains the\nordinary commonplace distinction between mental things\u2014thoughts,\nhopes and dreams\u2014and physical things\u2014tables and trees. And\non this divide, the work of art, for Croce, is still\na mental thing. In other words, the work of art in doubly\nideal; to put it another way, even if Croce were a\ndualist\u2014or a physicalist with some means of reconstructing\nthe physical-mental distinction\u2014the work of art would remain\nmental. In what follows, then, except where otherwise noted, we shall\ntreat Croce is being agnostic as between idealism, physicalism, or\ndualism (see PPH 227).\n\nThis claim about the ontological status of works of art means that a\nspectator \u2018of\u2019 a work of art\u2014a sonata, a poem, a\npainting\u2014is actually creating the work of art in his mind.\nCroce\u2019s main argument for this is the same as, therefore no\nbetter but no worse than, Russell\u2019s argument from the relativity\nof perception to sense-data. The perceived aesthetic qualities of\nanything vary with the states of the perceiver; therefore in speaking\nof the former we are really speaking of the latter (Aes. 106;\nCroce does not, it seems, consider the possibility that certain states\nof the perceiver might be privileged, but it is evident that he would\ndiscount this possibility). Now the Crocean formulation\u2014to\nintuit is to express\u2014perhaps begins to make sense. For\n\u2018intuition\u2019 is in some sense a mental act, along\nwith its near-cognates \u2018representation\u2019,\n\u2018imagination\u2019,\n\u2018invention\u2019,\u2018vision\u2019, and\n\u2018contemplation.\u2019 Being a mental act, something we do, it\nis not a mere external object.\n",
