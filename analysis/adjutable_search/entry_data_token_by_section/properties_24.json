    "main_text": "Formal Property Theories and their applications || Semantics and Logical Form\n6.3 Foundations of Mathematics\n\nSince the systematization in the first half of last century, which\ngave rise to paradox-free axiomatizations of set\ntheory such as ZFC, sets are\ntypically taken for granted in the foundations of mathematics and it\nis well known that they can do all the works that numbers can do. This\nhas led to the proposal of identifying numbers with sets.\nRussell\u2019s type theory was an alternative that rather relied on\nproperties (viewed as propositional functions), in backing up a\nlogicist reduction of mathematics to logic. In essence, the idea was\nthat properties can do all the work that sets are supposed to do, thus\nmaking the latter dispensable. Hence, Russell spoke of his approach as\na \u201cno-classes\u201d theory of classes (see Landini 2011: 115,\nand \u00a72.4 of the entry on\n Russell\u2019s logical atomism;\n cf. Bealer 1982: 111\u2013119, and Jubien 1989 for followers of this\nline). Following this line, numbers are then seen as properties rather\nthan sets.\n\nThe Russellian approach did not encounter among mathematicians a\nsuccess comparable to that of set theory. Nevertheless, from an\nontological point of view, it appears to be more economical in its\nrelying on properties, to the extent that the latter are needed any\nway for all sorts of explanatory jobs, reviewed above, which sets,\nqua extensional entities, can hardly perform. As we have\nseen, type theory is problematic. However, type-free property theories\ncan come to the rescue by replacing typed properties with untyped ones\nin the foundations of mathematics. And in fact the advocates of such\ntheories have often proposed to recover the logicist program, in\nparticular by identifying natural numbers with untyped properties of\nproperties (Bealer 1982; Cocchiarella 1986b; Orilia 2000b). (See also\nentry on\n logicism and neologicism).\n",
