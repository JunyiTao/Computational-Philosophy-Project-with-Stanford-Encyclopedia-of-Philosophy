Life and Works\n1.1 The life of John Duns the Scot\n\n\u2018Scotus\u2019 identifies Scotus as a Scot. His family name was\nDuns, which was also the name of the Scottish village in which he was\nborn, just a few miles from the English border. We do not know the\nprecise date of his birth, but we do know that Scotus was ordained to\nthe priesthood in the Order of Friars Minor\u2014the\nFranciscans\u2014at Saint Andrew\u2019s Priory in Northampton,\nEngland, on 17 March 1291. The minimum age for ordination was\ntwenty-five, so we can conclude that Scotus was born before 17 March\n1266. But how much before? The conjecture, plausible but by no means\ncertain, is that Scotus would have been ordained as early as\ncanonically permitted. Since the Bishop of Lincoln (the diocese that\nincluded Oxford, where Scotus was studying, as well as St\nAndrew\u2019s Priory) had ordained priests in Wycombe on 23 December\n1290, we can place Scotus\u2019s birth between 23 December 1265 and\n17 March 1266.\n\nScotus studied philosophy and then theology at Oxford beginning some\ntime in the 1280s. In the academic year 1298\u201399 he commented on\nthe first two books of the Sentences of Peter Lombard. Scotus\nleft Oxford for Paris, probably in 1302, and began lecturing on the\nSentences again (we think in the order Book I, Book IV, Book\nII, Book III). In June 1303 Scotus was expelled from France along with\neighty other friars for taking Pope Boniface VIII\u2019s side in a\ndispute with King Philip IV of France. After Boniface died in October\n1303 the king allowed the exiled students and masters to return, so\nScotus could have returned in the late fall of 1303 to resume his\nlectures on the Sentences. Scotus became Doctor of Theology\nin 1305 and was Franciscan regent master at Paris in 1306\u201307. He\nwas transferred to the Franciscan studium at Cologne,\nprobably beginning his duties as lector in October 1307. He died there\nin 1308; the date of his death is traditionally given as 8\nNovember.\n1.2 Scotus\u2019s works\n\nIt is generally agreed that Scotus\u2019s earliest works were his\ncommentaries on the Old Logic: questions on Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge and Aristotle\u2019s Categories, two sets\nof questions on Peri hermeneias, and De sophisticis\nelenchis. These probably date to around 1295; the Quaestiones\nsuper De anima is also very likely an early work (the editors\ndate it to the late 1280s or early 1290s). Scotus\u2019s other\nAristotelian commentary, the Quaestiones super libros\nMetaphysicorum Aristotelis, seems to have been started early; but\nBooks VI through IX are all late or were at least revised later in\nScotus\u2019s career. Scotus also wrote an Expositio on\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. It had been unidentified for\ncenturies but was recently identified and edited by Giorgio Pini.\n\nThings really get complicated when we come to Scotus\u2019s\ncommentaries on the four books of Sentences of Peter Lombard,\nsince he commented on the Sentences more than once and\nrevised his lectures over a long period; the relations among the\nvarious versions that have come down to us are not always clear.\nCertainly the Lectura presents us with Scotus\u2019s Oxford\nlectures on Books I and II of the Sentences in 1298\u201399.\nThere is an Ordinatio (i.e., a version prepared for\npublication by the author himself) of lectures at Oxford, based in\npart on the Lectura and on material from his lectures in\nParis. The Ordinatio, which Scotus seems to have been\nrevising up to his death, is generally taken to be Scotus\u2019s\npremier work; the critical edition was at last completed in 2013.\nFinally, Scotus lectured on the Sentences at Paris, and there\nare various Reportationes of these lectures. A critical\nedition is in progress; at present we have a transcription of a\nreasonably reliable manuscript of Book I. Although the Paris lectures\nthemselves were later than the Oxford lectures, it seems probable that\nparts of the Ordinatio\u2014Book IV and perhaps also Book\nIII\u2014are later than the corresponding parts of the\nReportatio.\n\nIn addition to these works, we have 46 short disputations called\nCollationes dating from 1300\u20131305, a late work in\nnatural theology called De primo principio, and\nQuaestiones Quodlibetales from Scotus\u2019s days as regent\nmaster (either Advent 1306 or Lent 1307). Finally, there is a work\ncalled Theoremata. Though doubts have been raised about its\nauthenticity, the recent critical edition accepts it as a genuine work\nof Scotus.\n2. Natural Theology\n2.1 Some methodological preliminaries\n\nNatural theology is, roughly, the effort to establish the existence\nand nature of God by arguments that in no way depend on the contents\nof a purported revelation. But is it even possible for human\nbeings to come to know God apart from revelation? Scotus certainly\nthinks so. Like any good Aristotelian, he thinks all our knowledge\nbegins in some way with our experience of sensible things. But he is\nconfident that even from such humble beginnings we can come to grasp\nGod.\n\nScotus agrees with Thomas Aquinas that all our knowledge of God starts\nfrom creatures, and that as a result we can only prove the existence\nand nature of God by what the medievals call an argument quia\n(reasoning from effect to cause), not by an argument propter\nquid (reasoning from essence to characteristic). Aquinas and\nScotus further agree that, for that same reason, we cannot know the\nessence of God in this life. The main difference between the two\nauthors is that Scotus believes we can apply certain predicates\nunivocally\u2014with exactly the same meaning\u2014to God and\ncreatures, whereas Aquinas insists that this is impossible, and that\nwe can only use analogical predication, in which a word as applied to\nGod has a meaning different from, although related to, the meaning of\nthat same word as applied to creatures. (See\n medieval theories of analogy\n for details.)\n\nScotus has a number of arguments for univocal predication and against\nthe doctrine of analogy (Ordinatio 1, d. 3, pars 1, q.\n1\u20132, nn. 26\u201355). One of the most compelling uses\nAquinas\u2019s own view against him. Aquinas had said that all our\nconcepts come from creatures. Scotus says, very well, where will that\nanalogous concept come from? It can\u2019t come from anywhere. If all\nour concepts come from creatures (and Scotus doesn\u2019t deny this),\nthen the concepts we apply to God will also come from creatures. They\nwon\u2019t just be like the concepts that come from\ncreatures, as in analogous predication; they will have to be the\nvery same concepts that come from creatures, as in univocal\npredication. Those are the only concepts we can have\u2014the only\nconcepts we can possibly get. So if we can\u2019t use the concepts we\nget from creatures, we can\u2019t use any concepts at all, and so we\ncan\u2019t talk about God\u2014which is false.\n\nAnother argument for univocal predication is based on an argument from\nAnselm. Consider all predicates, Anselm says. Now get rid of the ones\nthat are merely relatives, since no relative expresses the nature of a\nthing as it is in itself. (So we\u2019re not talking about such\npredicates as \u201csupreme being\u201d or \u201cCreator,\u201d\nsince even though those properly apply to God, they don\u2019t tell\nus anything about what God is in himself, only about how he is related\nto other things.) Now take the predicates that are left. Here\u2019s\nthe test. Let F be our predicate-variable. For any\nF, either\n\n(a) It is in every respect better to be F than not to be\nF.\n\n~or~\n\n(b) It is in some respect better to be not-F than\nF.\n\nA predicate will fall into the second category if and only if it\nimplies some sort of limitation or deficiency. Anselm\u2019s argument\nis that we can (indeed must) predicate of God every predicate that\nfalls into the first category, and that we cannot predicate of God any\npredicate that falls into the second (except metaphorically, perhaps).\nScotus agrees with Anselm on this point (as did Aquinas: see\nSCG I.30). Scotus has his own terminology for whatever it is\nin every respect better to be than not to be. He calls such things\n\u201cpure perfections\u201d (perfectiones simpliciter). A\npure perfection is any predicate that does not imply limitation.\n\nSo Scotus claims that pure perfections can be predicated of God. But\nhe takes this a step further than Anselm. He says that they have to be\npredicated univocally of God; otherwise the whole business of\npure perfections won\u2019t make any sense. Here\u2019s the\nargument. If we are going to use Anselm\u2019s test, we must first\ncome up with our concept\u2014say, of good. Then we check out the\nconcept to see whether it is in every respect better to be good than\nnot-good. We realize that it is, and so we predicate\n\u2018good\u2019 of God. That test obviously won\u2019t work unless\nit\u2019s the same concept that we\u2019re applying in both\ncases.\n\nOne can see this more clearly by considering the two possible ways in\nwhich one might deny that the same concept is applied to both God and\ncreatures. One might say that the concept of the pure perfection\napplies only to creatures, and the concept we apply to God has to be\nsomething different; or one might try it the other way around and say\nthat the concept of the pure perfection applies only to God, and the\nconcept we apply to creatures has to be something different. Take the\nfirst possibility. If we come up with the idea of a pure perfection\nfrom creatures and don\u2019t apply the same concept to God,\nwe\u2019re saying that we can come up with something that is in every\nrespect better to be than not to be, but it doesn\u2019t apply to\nGod. Such a view would destroy the idea that God is the greatest and\nmost perfect being. So then one might try the second possibility: the\nconcept of the pure perfection really applies only to God. Scotus\npoints out that that can\u2019t be right either. For then the\nperfection we apply to creatures won\u2019t be the pure perfection\nany more, and so the creature wouldn\u2019t be better off for having\nthis pseudo-perfection. But the whole way in which we came up with the\nidea of the pure perfection in the first place was by considering\nperfections in creatures\u2014in other words, by considering what\nfeatures made creatures better in every respect. So this possibility\ngets the test backwards: it says that we have to start with knowing\nwhat features God has and thereby determining what is a pure\nperfection, but in fact we first figure out what the pure perfections\nare and thereby know what features God has.\n\nNot only can we come up with concepts that apply univocally to God and\ncreatures, we can even come up with a proper (distinctive)\nconcept of God. Now in one sense we can\u2019t have a proper concept\nof God in this life, since we can\u2019t know his essence as a\nparticular thing. We know God in the way that we know, say, a person\nwe have heard about but have never met. That is, we know him through\ngeneral concepts that can apply both to him and to other things. In\nanother sense, though, we can have a proper concept of God, that is,\none that applies only to God. If we take any of the pure perfections\nto the highest degree, they will be predicable of God alone. Better\nyet, we can describe God more completely by taking all the pure\nperfections in the highest degree and attributing them all to him.\n\nBut these are all composite concepts; they all involve putting two\nquite different notions together: \u2018highest\u2019 with\n\u2018good\u2019, \u2018first\u2019 with \u2018cause\u2019, and\nso on. Scotus says that we can come up with a relatively\nsimple concept that is proper to God alone, the concept of\n\u201cinfinite being.\u201d Now that concept might seem to be every\nbit as composite as \u201chighest good\u201d or \u201cfirst\ncause,\u201d but it\u2019s really not. For \u201cinfinite\nbeing\u201d is a concept of something essentially one: a being that\nhas infinity (unlimitedness) as its intrinsic way of existing. I will\nreturn to the crucial role of the concept of infinite being in\nScotus\u2019s natural theology after I examine his proof of the\nexistence of God.\n2.2 Proof of the existence of God\n\nScotus\u2019s argument for the existence of God is rightly regarded\nas one of the most outstanding contributions ever made to natural\ntheology. The argument is enormously complex, with several\nsub-arguments for almost every important conclusion, and I can only\nsketch it here. (Different versions of the proof are given at\nLectura 1, d. 2, q. 1, nn. 38\u2013135; Ordinatio\n1, d. 2, q. 1, nn. 39\u2013190; Reportatio 1, d. 2, q. 1;\nand De primo principio.)\n\nScotus begins by arguing that there is a first agent (a being that is\nfirst in efficient causality). Consider first the distinction between\nessentially ordered causes and accidentally ordered causes. In an\naccidentally ordered series, the fact that a given member of that\nseries is itself caused is accidental to that member\u2019s own\ncausal activity. For example, Grandpa A generates a son, Dad B, who in\nturn generates a son of his own, Grandson C. B\u2019s generating C in\nno way depends on A\u2014A could be long dead by the time B starts\nhaving children. The fact that B was caused by A is irrelevant to\nB\u2019s own causal activity. That\u2019s how an accidentally\nordered series of causes works.\n\nIn an essentially ordered series, by contrast, the causal activity of\nlater members of the series depends essentially on the causal activity\nof earlier members. For example, my shoulders move my arms, which in\nturn move my golf club. My arms are capable of moving the golf club\nonly because they are being moved by my shoulders.\n\nWith that distinction in mind, we can examine Scotus\u2019s argument\nfor the existence of a first efficient cause:\n\n\n\n(1)\nNo effect can produce itself. \n\n(2)\nNo effect can be produced by just nothing at all. \n\n(3)\nA circle of causes is impossible. \n\n(4)\nTherefore, an effect must be produced by something else. (from\n1, 2, and 3) \n\n(5)\nThere is no infinite regress in an essentially ordered series of\ncauses.  \n\n\n\n\n(5a)\nIt is not necessarily the case that a being possessing a causal\npower C possesses C in an imperfect way. \n\n(5b)\nTherefore, it is possible that C is possessed without\nimperfection by some item. \n\n(5c)\nIf it is not possible for any item to possess C without\ndependence on some prior item, then it is not possible that there is\nany item that possesses C without imperfection (since dependence is a\nkind of imperfection). \n\n(5d)\nTherefore, it is possible that some item possesses C without\ndependence on some prior item. (from 5b and 5c by modus tollens)\n\n\n(5e)\nAny item possessing C without dependence on some prior item is a\nfirst agent (i.e., an agent that is not subsequent to any prior causes\nin an essentially ordered series). \n\n(5f)\nTherefore, it is possible that something is a first agent. (from\n5d and 5e) \n\n(5g)\nIf it is possible that something is a first agent, something is\na first agent. (For, by definition, if there were no first agent,\nthere would be no cause that could bring it about, so it would not in\nfact be possible for there to be a first agent.) \n\n(5h)\nTherefore, something is a first agent (i.e., an agent that is\nnot subsequent to any prior causes in an essentially ordered\nseries\u2014Scotus still has to prove that there is an agent that is\nnot subsequent to any prior causes in an accidentally ordered series\neither. That\u2019s what he does in step (6) below). (from 5f and\n5g)  \n\n\n\n\n(6)\nIt is not possible for there to be an accidentally ordered\nseries of causes unless there is an essentially ordered series.\n \n\n\n\n\n(6a)\nIn an accidentally ordered series, each member of the series\n(except the first, if there is a first) comes into existence as a\nresult of the causal activity of a prior member of the series.\n\n\n(6b)\nThat causal activity is exercised in virtue of a certain\nform. \n\n(6c)\nTherefore, each member of the series depends on that form for\nits causal activity. \n\n(6d)\nThe form is not itself a member of the series. \n\n(6e)\nTherefore, the accidentally ordered series is essentially\ndependent on a higher-order cause.  \n\n\n\n\n(7)\nTherefore, there is a first agent. (from 4, 5, and 6) \n\n\n\nScotus then goes on to argue that there is an ultimate goal of\nactivity (a being that is first in final causality), and a maximally\nexcellent being (a being that is first in what Scotus calls\n\u201cpre-eminence\u201d).\n\nThus he has proved what he calls the \u201ctriple primacy\u201d:\nthere is a being that is first in efficient causality, in final\ncausality, and in pre-eminence. Scotus next proves that the three\nprimacies are coextensive: that is, any being that is first in one of\nthese three ways will also be first in the other two ways. Scotus then\nargues that a being enjoying the triple primacy is endowed with\nintellect and will, and that any such being is infinite. Finally, he\nargues that there can be only one such being.\n2.3 Divine infinity and the doctrine of univocity\n\nIn laying out Scotus\u2019s proof of the existence of God, I passed\nrather quickly over the claim that God is infinite. But the divine\ninfinity deserves more detailed treatment. As we have already seen,\nthe concept of \u201cinfinite being\u201d has a privileged role in\nScotus\u2019s natural theology. As a first approximation, we can say\nthat divine infinity is for Scotus what divine simplicity is for\nAquinas. It\u2019s the central divine-attribute generator. But there\nare some important differences between the role of simplicity in\nAquinas and the role of infinity in Scotus. The most important, I\nthink, is that in Aquinas simplicity acts as an ontological spoilsport\nfor theological semantics. Simplicity is in some sense the key thing\nabout God, metaphysically speaking, but it seriously complicates our\nlanguage about God. God is supposed to be a subsistent simple, but\nbecause our language is all derived from creatures, which are all\neither subsistent but complex or simple but non-subsistent, we\ndon\u2019t have any way to apply our language straightforwardly to\nGod. The divine nature systematically resists being captured in\nlanguage.\n\nFor Scotus, though, infinity is not only what\u2019s ontologically\ncentral about God; it\u2019s the key component of our best available\nconcept of God and a guarantor of the success of theological language.\nThat is, our best ontology, far from fighting with our theological\nsemantics, both supports and is supported by our theological\nsemantics. The doctrine of univocity rests in part on the claim that\n\u201c[t]he difference between God and creatures, at least with\nregard to God\u2019s possession of the pure perfections, is\nultimately one of degree\u201d (Cross [1999], 39). Remember one of\nScotus\u2019s arguments for univocity. If we are to follow Anselm in\nascribing to God every pure perfection, we have to affirm that we are\nascribing to God the very same thing that we ascribe to\ncreatures: God has it infinitely, creatures in a limited way. One\ncould hardly ask for a more harmonious cooperation between ontology\n(what God is) and semantics (how we can think and talk about him).\n\nScotus ascribes to Aquinas the following argument for the divine\ninfinity: If a form is limited by matter, it is finite. God, being\nsimple, is not limited by matter. Therefore, God is not finite. This,\nas Scotus points out, is a fallacious argument. (It\u2019s an\ninstance of denying the antecedent.) But even apart from the fallacy,\nsimplicity is not going to get us infinity. As Scotus puts it:\n\u201cif an entity is finite or infinite, it is so not by reason of\nsomething accidental to itself, but because it has its own intrinsic\ndegree of finite or infinite perfection\u201d (Ordinatio 1,\nd. 1, pars 1, q. 1\u20132, n. 142). So simplicity does not entail\ninfinity, because finitude is not the result of composition. To look\nat it another way, Aquinas\u2019s conception of infinity is\nnegative and relational. The infinite is that which\nis not bounded by something else. But Scotus thinks we can\nhave a positive conception of infinity, according to which infinity is\nnot a negative, relational property, but instead a positive, intrinsic\nproperty. It is an \u201cintrinsic degree of perfection.\u201d\n\nHow do we acquire that conception of positive, intrinsic infinity? The\nstory goes like this. We begin with \u201cthe potentially infinite in\nquantity.\u201d According to Aristotle, you can never have an actual\nquantitative infinity, since no matter how great a quantity you have,\nyou can always have more. What you can have (and in fact do have,\nAristotle thinks) is a quantitative infinity by successive parts. The\nnext step is to imagine that all the parts of that quantitative\ninfinity remained in existence simultaneously. That is, we imagine an\nactual quantitative infinity. Scotus then asks us to shift from\nthinking about an actual quantitative infinity to thinking about an\nactual qualitative infinity. Think of some quality (say,\ngoodness) as existing infinitely: so that there is, as it were, no\nmore goodness that you could add to that goodness to make it any\ngreater. That\u2019s infinite goodness. But notice that you\ncan\u2019t think of infinite goodness as in some way composed of\nlittle goodness-bits (just an infinite number of them). If I say that\nan angel is better than a human being, I can\u2019t mean that a human\nbeing has a certain number of goodness-bits while the angel has that\nmany plus some extras. Rather, the specific degree of goodness of a\nthing is just an intrinsic, non-quantitative feature of that thing.\nInfinite being is just like that. Scotus describes it as \u201ca\nmeasure of intrinsic excellence that is not finite.\u201d This is why\nthe concept of \u201cinfinite being\u201d is the simplest concept\navailable to us for understanding God. Infinity is not some sort of\naccidental addition to being, but an intrinsic mode of being. Of\ncourse, if this is right, then the concepts of \u2018infinite\ngoodness\u2019, \u2018infinite power\u2019, and so forth, are every\nbit as simple as the concept of \u2018infinite being\u2019. So why\ndoes Scotus make such a big deal about \u2018infinite being\u2019?\nBecause \u2018infinite being\u2019 \u201cvirtually contains\u201d\nall the other infinite perfections of God. That is, we can deduce the\nother infinite perfections from infinite being. So besides being the\nnext best thing to a simple concept, it\u2019s the most theoretically\nfruitful concept we can have of God in this life.\n3. Metaphysics\n3.1 The subject matter of metaphysics\n\nMetaphysics, according to Scotus, is a \u201creal theoretical\nscience\u201d: it is real in that it treats things rather than\nconcepts, theoretical in that it is pursued for its own sake rather\nthan as a guide for doing or making things, and a science in that it\nproceeds from self-evident principles to conclusions that follow\ndeductively from them. The various real theoretical sciences are\ndistinguished by their subject matter, and Scotus devotes considerable\nattention to determining what the distinctive subject matter of\nmetaphysics is. His conclusion is that metaphysics concerns\n\u201cbeing qua being\u201d (ens inquantum ens).\nThat is, the metaphysician studies being simply as such, rather than\nstudying, say, material being as material.\n\nThe study of being qua being includes, first of all, the\nstudy of the transcendentals, so called because they transcend the\ndivision of being into finite and infinite, and the further division\nof finite being into the ten Aristotelian categories. Being itself is\na transcendental, and so are the \u201cproper attributes\u201d of\nbeing\u2014one, true, and good\u2014which are coextensive with\nbeing. Scotus also identifies an indefinite number of disjunctions\nthat are coextensive with being and therefore count as\ntranscendentals, such as infinite-or-finite and\nnecessary-or-contingent. Finally, all the pure perfections (see above)\nare transcendentals, since they transcend the division of being into\nfinite and infinite. Unlike the proper attributes of being and the\ndisjunctive transcendentals, however, they are not coextensive with\nbeing. For God is wise and Socrates is wise, but\nearthworms\u2014though they are certainly beings\u2014are not\nwise.\n\nThe study of the Aristotelian categories also belongs to metaphysics\ninsofar as the categories, or the things falling under them, are\nstudied as beings. (If they are studied as concepts, they belong\ninstead to the logician.) There are exactly ten categories, Scotus\nargues. The first and most important is the category of substance.\nSubstances are beings in the most robust sense, since they have an\nindependent existence: that is, they do not exist in\nsomething else. Beings in any of the other nine categories, called\naccidents, exist in substances. The nine categories of accidents are\nquantity, quality, relation, action, passion, place, time, position,\nand state (habitus).\n3.2 Matter and form, body and soul\n\nNow imagine some particular substance, say, me. Suppose I go from\nbeing pale to being tan. Now it is still I who exist both before and\nafter the sun has had its characteristic effect on me. This\nillustrates an important feature of substances: they can successively\nhave contrary accidents and yet retain their numerical identity. This\nsort of change is known, appropriately enough, as accidental change.\nIn an accidental change, a substance persists through the change,\nhaving first one accident and then another. But clearly not all\nchanges are accidental changes. There was once a time when I did not\nexist, and then I came into existence. We can\u2019t analyze this\nchange as an accidental change, since there doesn\u2019t seem to be\nany substance that persists through the change. Instead, a substance\nis precisely what comes into being; this is not an accidental but a\nsubstantial change. And yet there must be something that\npersists even through substantial change, since otherwise we\nwouldn\u2019t have change at all; substances would come to exist from\nnothing and disappear into nothing. Scotus follows Aristotle in\nidentifying matter as what persists through substantial\nchange and substantial form as what makes a given parcel of\nmatter the definite, unique, individual substance that it is. (There\nare also accidental forms, which are a substance\u2019s accidental\nqualities.)\n\nThus far Scotus is simply repeating Aristotelian orthodoxy, and none\nof his contemporaries or immediate predecessors would have found any\nof this at all strange. But as Scotus elaborates his views on form and\nmatter, he espouses three important theses that mark him off from some\nother philosophers of his day: he holds that matter can exist without\nany form whatsoever, that not all created substances are composites of\nform and matter, and that one and the same substance can have more\nthan one substantial form. Let us examine each of these theses in\nturn.\n\nFirst, Scotus argues that God can create and conserve what was called\n\u201cprime matter\u201d: that is, matter that has no form\nwhatsoever. (For an analysis of the arguments, see Ward 2014.) Matter\nand form are distinct things, as the case of substantial change makes\nclear: matter persists when forms come and go. Now that fact by itself\nmight be taken to show only that matter can exist apart from any\ngiven form (and Scotus thinks that too), but Scotus takes the\nseparability of matter and form even further. Divine omnipotence means\nthat God can cause immediately (that is, without a secondary cause)\nwhatever he ordinarily causes through a secondary cause. God\nordinarily causes matter through form; but given divine omnipotence,\nhe need not. He can create matter without any form. Moreover, given\nthat matter is a thing distinct from form, God creates matter directly\nand immediately; and what God creates immediately, he can conserve\nimmediately. So God can conserve matter without conserving any of the\nforms that characterize that matter.\n\nSecond, Scotus denies \u201cuniversal hylomorphism,\u201d the view\nthat all created substances are composites of form and matter\n(Lectura 2, d. 12, q. un., n. 55). Universal hylomorphism\n(from the Greek hyle, meaning \u2018matter\u2019, and\nmorphe, meaning \u2018form\u2019) had been the predominant\nview among Franciscans before Scotus. Saint Bonaventure, for example,\nhad argued that even angels could not be altogether immaterial; they\nmust be compounds of form and \u201cspiritual matter.\u201d For\nmatter is potentiality and form is actuality, so if the angels were\naltogether immaterial, they would be pure actuality without any\nadmixture of potentiality. But only God is pure actuality. But as we\nhave already seen in his affirmation of the existence of prime matter,\nScotus simply denies the unqualified equation of matter with\npotentiality and form with actuality. Prime matter, though entirely\nwithout form, could be actual; and a purely immaterial being is not\nautomatically bereft of potentiality.\n\nThird, Scotus holds that some substances have more than one\nsubstantial form (Ordinatio 4, d. 11, q. 3, n. 54). This\ndoctrine of the plurality of substantial forms was commonly held among\nthe Franciscans but vigorously disputed by others. We can very easily\nsee the motivation for the view by recalling that a substantial form\nis supposed to be what makes a given parcel of matter the definite,\nunique, individual substance that it is. Now suppose, as many medieval\nthinkers (including Aquinas) did, that the soul is the one and only\nsubstantial form of the human being. It would then follow that when a\nhuman being dies, and the soul ceases to inform that parcel of matter,\nwhat is left is not the same body that existed just before death;\nthere is an entirely new substance, with entirely new accidents (for\naccidents depend for their being on the substance in which they\ninhere). For what made it that very body was its substantial form,\nwhich (ex hypothesi) is no longer there.\n\nTo Scotus and many of his fellow Franciscans it therefore seemed\nobvious that we need to posit a plurality of substantial forms to\navoid these metaphysical incongruities. One standard form of such\npluralism postulated a \u201cform of the body\u201d (forma\ncorporeitatis) that makes a given parcel of matter to be a\ndefinite, unique, individual organism, and the \u201canimating\nform\u201d or soul, which makes that body alive. At death, the\nanimating soul ceases to vivify the body, but numerically the same\nbody remains, and the form of the body keeps the matter organized, at\nleast for a while. Since the form of the body is too weak on its own\nto keep the body in existence indefinitely, however, it gradually\ndecomposes.\n\nScotus\u2019s view is more complicated still, for he treats each\norgan of a living body as a substance (a composite of matter and\nsubstantial form). Whether Scotus also acknowledges a forma\ncorporeitatis over and above the forms of the bodily organs is\ndisputed (see Ward 2014, 90\u201393). If he does not, he must accept\nthe unpalatable conclusion that a corpse is not the same body as the\nbody of the organism. He can, however, avoid the conclusion that no\naccidents of that body remain: any accidents that inhere in the organs\ncan remain, because the organs are substances and continue to exist\n(for a while, anyway) when the body of which they were parts ceases to\nexist.\n\nNote that the general tendency of Scotus\u2019s theories of form and\nmatter is to allow a high degree of independence to form and matter.\nIn positing the existence of prime matter, Scotus envisions matter as\nexisting without any form; in denying universal hylomorphism, he\nenvisions form as existing without any matter. And the doctrine of the\nplurality of substantial forms strongly suggests that the human soul\nis an identifiable individual in its own right. So everything Scotus\nsays in this connection seems to make room for the\npossibility that the soul survives the death of the body and\ncontinues to exist as an immaterial substance in its own right. But\nScotus canvases a number of philosophical arguments for the claim that\nthis possibility is in fact realized, and he finds none of them\ncompelling. That the human soul survives the death of the body is\nsomething we can know only through faith.\n3.3 Universals and individuation\n\nThe problem of universals may be thought of as the question of what,\nif anything, is the metaphysical basis of our using the same predicate\nfor more than one distinct individual. Socrates is human and Plato is\nhuman. Does this mean that there must be some one universal\nreality\u2014humanity\u2014that is somehow repeatable, in\nwhich Socrates and Plato both share? Or is there nothing\nmetaphysically common to them at all? Those who think there is some\nactual universal existing outside the mind are called realists; those\nwho deny extra-mental universals are called nominalists. Scotus was a\nrealist about universals, and like all realists he had to give an\naccount of what exactly those universals are: what their status is,\nwhat sort of existence they have outside the mind. So, in the case of\nSocrates and Plato, the question is \u201cWhat sort of item is this\nhumanity that both Socrates and Plato exemplify?\u201d A related\nquestion that realists have to face is the problem of individuation.\nGiven that there is some extra-mental reality common to Socrates and\nPlato, we also need to know what it is in each of them that makes them\ndistinct exemplifications of that extra-mental reality.\n\nScotus calls the extra-mental universal the \u201ccommon\nnature\u201d (natura communis) and the principle of\nindividuation the \u201chaecceity\u201d (haecceitas). The\ncommon nature is common in that it is \u201cindifferent\u201d to\nexisting in any number of individuals. But it has extra-mental\nexistence only in the particular things in which it exists,\nand in them it is always \u201ccontracted\u201d by the haecceity. So\nthe common nature humanity exists in both Socrates and Plato,\nalthough in Socrates it is made individual by Socrates\u2019s\nhaecceitas and in Plato by Plato\u2019s haecceitas.\nThe humanity-of-Socrates is individual and non-repeatable, as is the\nhumanity-of-Plato; yet humanity itself is common and repeatable, and\nit is ontologically prior to any particular exemplification of it\n(Ordinatio 2, d. 3, pars 1, qq. 1\u20136, translated in\nSpade [1994], 57\u2013113).\n4. Theory of Knowledge\n4.1 Sensation and abstraction\n\nScotus adopts the standard medieval Aristotelian view that human\nbeings, alone among the animals, have two different sorts of cognitive\npowers: senses and intellect. The senses differ from the intellect in\nthat they have physical organs; the intellect is immaterial. In order\nfor the intellect to make use of sensory information, therefore, it\nmust somehow take the raw material provided by the senses in the form\nof material images and make them into suitable objects for\nunderstanding. This process is known as abstraction, from the Latin\nabstrahere, which is literally \u201cto drag out.\u201d The\nintellect pulls out the universal, as it were, from the material\nsingular in which it is embedded. This activity is performed by the\nactive or agent intellect, which takes the \u201cphantasms\u201d\nderived from sense experience and turns them into \u201cintelligible\nspecies.\u201d Those species are actualized in the possible or\nreceptive intellect, whose function is to receive and then store the\nintelligible species provided by the active intellect. Scotus denies\nthat the active and passive intellect are really distinct. Rather,\nthere is one intellect that has these two distinct functions or\npowers.\n\nPhantasms do not, however, become irrelevant once the intelligible\nspecies has been abstracted. Scotus holds (just as Aquinas had held)\nthat the human intellect never understands anything without turning\ntowards phantasms (Lectura 2, d. 3, pars 2, q. 1, n. 255).\nThat is, in order to deploy a concept that has already been acquired,\none must make some use of sensory data\u2014although the phantasms\nemployed in using a concept already acquired need not be anything like\nthe phantasms from which that concept was abstracted in the first\nplace. I acquired the intelligible species of dog from phantasms of\ndogs, but I can make use of that concept now not only by calling up an\nimage of a dog but also by (say) imagining the sound of the Latin word\nfor dog. Scotus\u2019s point is simply that there must be some\nsensory context for any act of intellectual cognition.\n\nAnd even that point is not quite as general as my unqualified\nstatement suggests. For one thing, Scotus believes that our\nintellect\u2019s need for phantasms is a temporary state. It is only\nin this present life that the intellect must turn to phantasms; in the\nnext life we will be able to do without them. For another thing,\nScotus argues in his later works that even in this life we enjoy a\nkind of intellectual cognition that bypasses phantasms. He called it\n\u201cintuitive cognition.\u201d\n4.2 Intuitive cognition\n\nScotus understands intuitive cognition by way of contrast with\nabstractive cognition. The latter, as we have seen, involves the\nuniversal; and a universal as such need not be exemplified. That is,\nmy intelligible species of dog only tells me what it is to be a dog;\nit doesn\u2019t tell me whether any particular dog actually exists.\nIntuitive cognition, by contrast, \u201cyields information about how\nthings are right now\u201d (Pasnau [2002]). Sensory cognition, as\nScotus explicitly acknowledges, counts as intuitive cognition on this\naccount. It is, after all, quite uncontroversial that my seeing or\nhearing a dog gives me information about some particular dog as it\nexists when I see or hear it. Scotus\u2019s much bolder claim\nconcerns intellectual intuitive cognition, by which the\nintellect cognizes a particular thing as existing at that very moment.\nIntellectual intuitive cognition does not require phantasms; nor does\nit involve intelligible species (which, like phantasms, are\nabstractive).\n\nIntellectual intuitive cognition has two different kinds of objects:\nextramental sensible objects and the soul\u2019s own acts. (Scotus\ncomes around to affirming the possibility of such cognition of\nextramental objects in his later works, having denied it earlier in\nhis career; he is consistent about the possibility of intuitive\ncognition of the soul\u2019s acts. See Cross 2014, 43\u201364, on\nwhom I draw thoughout this section.) We must have intuitive cognition\nof extramental objects because we can cognize them intellectually\nas existing; we can form propositions about them and use such\npropositions in syllogisms. So, for example, if I form the proposition\n\u201cThis flower is red,\u201d the contents of that proposition\nmust be in the intellect, not merely in the sense. This is\nintellectual cognition because it is conceptual; it is\nintuitive cognition because it concerns something as\nexisting. The information contained in the sensible\nspecies\u2014the shape and color of the flower\u2014is \"promoted\" by\nthe agent intellect from material existence in an organ to immaterial\nexistence in the non-organic intellect, so that it is available for\nintellectual cognition. The role of sensible species in intuitive\nintellectual cognition explains why Scotus denies that we can have\nsuch cognition of non-sensible objects, such as angels, in this\nlife.\n\nWe also have intuitive cognition of our mental acts. (As I discuss in\nthe next section, Scotus attaches considerable importance to our\nintuitive self-knowledge). Abstractive cognition could provide me with\nan abstract concept of thinking about Scotus, for example,\nbut I need intuitive cognition to know that I am in fact exemplifying\nthat concept right this minute. This kind of intuitive cognition\nclearly dispenses even with sensible species, since the\nintellect\u2019s acts, like the intellect itself, are immaterial and\ntherefore not the sorts of things that can be sensed.\n4.3 The attack on skepticism and illuminationism\n\nScotus argues that the human intellect is capable of achieving\ncertainty in its knowledge of the truth simply by the exercise of its\nown natural powers, with no special divine help. He therefore opposes\nboth skepticism, which denies the possibility of certain knowledge,\nand illuminationism, which insists that we need special divine\nillumination in order to attain certainty. He works out his attack on\nboth doctrines in the course of a reply to Henry of Ghent in\nOrdinatio 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 4. (For a translation, see van\nden Bercken [2016], 114\u2013143.)\n\nAccording to Henry, truth involves a relation to an\n\u201cexemplar.\u201d (We can think of this relation as akin to the\nrelation of correspondence appealed to by certain theories of truth,\nand the exemplar itself as the mental item that is one of the relata\nof the correspondence-relation. The other relatum, of course, is\n\u201cthe way things really are.\u201d) Now there are two exemplars:\nthe created exemplar, which is the species of the universal caused by\nthe thing known, and the uncreated exemplar, which is an idea in the\ndivine mind. Henry argues that the created exemplar cannot provide us\nwith certain and infallible knowledge of a thing. For, first, the\nobject from which the exemplar is abstracted is itself mutable and\ntherefore cannot be the cause of something immutable. And how can\nthere be certain knowledge apart from some immutable basis for that\nknowledge? Second, the soul itself is mutable and subject to error,\nand it can be preserved from error only by something less mutable than\nitself. But the created exemplar is even more mutable than the soul.\nThird, the created exemplar by itself does not allow us to distinguish\nbetween reality and dreaming, since the content of the exemplar is the\nsame in either case. Henry therefore concludes that if we are to have\ncertainty, we must look to the uncreated exemplar. And since we cannot\nlook to the uncreated exemplar by our natural powers, certainty is\nimpossible apart from some special divine illumination.\n\nScotus argues that if Henry is right about the limitations of our\nnatural powers, even divine illumination is not enough to save us from\npervasive uncertainty. To Henry\u2019s first argument he replies that\nthere is no certainty to be had by knowing a mutable object as\nimmutable. To the second he replies that anything in the\nsoul\u2014including the very act of understanding that Henry thinks\nis achieved through illumination\u2014is mutable. So by Henry\u2019s\nargument it would be impossible for anything whatever to preserve the\nsoul from error. And to the third argument he replies that if the\ncreated exemplar is such as to preclude certainty, adding extra\nexemplars will not solve the problem: \u201cWhen something\nincompatible with certainty concurs, certainty cannot be\nattained\u201d (Ordinatio 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 4, n.\n221).\n\nSo Henry\u2019s arguments, far from showing that certainty is\npossible through divine illumination, actually lead to a pervasive\nskepticism. Scotus counters that we can show that skepticism is false.\nWe can in fact attain certainty, and we can do so by the unaided\nexercise of our natural intellectual powers. There are four types of\nknowledge in which infallible certainty is possible. First, knowledge\nof first principles is certain because the intellect has only to form\nsuch judgments to see that they are true. (And since the validity of\nproper syllogistic inference can be known in just this way, it follows\nthat anything that is seen to be properly derived from first\nprinciples by syllogistic inference is also known with certainty.)\nSecond, we have certainty with respect to quite a lot of causal\njudgments derived from experience. Third, Scotus says that many of our\nown acts are as certain as first principles. It is no objection to\npoint out that our acts are contingent, since some contingent\npropositions must be known immediately (that is, without needing to be\nderived from some other proposition). For otherwise, either some\ncontingent proposition would follow from a necessary proposition\n(which is impossible), or there would be an infinite regress in\ncontingent propositions (in which case no contingent proposition would\never be known). Fourth, certain propositions about present sense\nexperience are also known with certainty if they are properly vetted\nby the intellect in light of the causal judgments derived from\nexperience.\n5. Ethics and Moral Psychology\n5.1 The natural law\n\nFor Scotus the natural law in the strict sense contains only those\nmoral propositions that are per se notae ex terminis along\nwith whatever propositions can be derived from them deductively\n(Ordinatio 3, d. 37, q. un.). Per se notae means\nthat they are self-evident; ex terminis adds that they are\nself-evident in virtue of being analytically true. Now one important\nfact about propositions that are self-evident and analytically true is\nthat God himself can\u2019t make them false. They are necessary\ntruths. So the natural law in the strict sense does not depend on\nGod\u2019s will. This means that even if (as I believe) Scotus is\nsome sort of divine-command theorist, he is not whole-hog in his\ndivine command theory. Some moral truths are necessary truths, and\neven God can\u2019t change those. They would be true no matter what\nGod willed.\n\nWhich ones are those? Scotus\u2019s basic answer is that they are the\ncommandments of the first tablet of the Decalogue (Ten Commandments).\nThe Decalogue has often been thought of as involving two tablets. The\nfirst covers our obligations to God and consists of the first three\ncommandments: You shall have no other gods before me, You\nshall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, and\nRemember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. (Note that many\nProtestants divide them up differently.) The second tablet spells out\nour obligations toward others: Honor your father and mother,\nYou shall not kill, You shall not commit adultery,\nYou shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness\nagainst your neighbor, and two commandments against coveting. The\ncommandments of the first tablet are part of the natural law in the\nstrict sense because they have to do with God himself, and with the\nway in which God is to be treated. For Scotus says that the following\nproposition is per se nota ex terminis: \u201cIf God exists,\nthen he is to be loved as God, and nothing else is to be worshiped as\nGod, and no irreverence is to be done to him.\u201d Given the very\ndefinition of God, it follows that if there is such a being, he is to\nbe loved and worshiped, and no irreverence should be shown to him.\nBecause these commandments are self-evident and analytic, they are\nnecessary truths. Not even God himself could make them false.\n\nBut even the first three commandments, once we start looking at them,\nare not obviously part of the natural law in the strict sense. In\nparticular, the third commandment, the one about the Sabbath day, is a\nlittle tricky. Obviously, the proposition \u201cGod is to be\nworshiped on Saturday\u201d is not self-evident or analytic. In fact,\nScotus says it\u2019s not even true any more, since Christians are to\nworship on Sunday, not Saturday. So, Scotus asks, what about the\nproposition \u201cGod is to be worshiped at some time or\nother\u201d? Even that is not self-evident or analytic. The best one\ncan do is \u201cGod is not to be hated.\u201d Now that\u2019s\nself-evident and analytic, since by definition God is the being most\nworthy of love and there is nothing in him worthy of hate. But\nobviously that\u2019s far weaker than any positive commandment about\nwhether and when we should worship God.\n\nSo by the time Scotus completes his analysis, we are left with nothing\nin the natural law in the strict sense except for negative\npropositions: God is not to be hated, no other gods are to be\nworshiped, no irreverence is to be done to God. Everything else in the\nDecalogue belongs to the natural law in a weaker or looser sense.\nThese are propositions that are not per se notae ex terminis\nand do not follow from such propositions, but are \u201chighly\nconsonant\u201d with such propositions. Now the important point for\nScotus is this: since these propositions are contingent, they are\ncompletely up to God\u2019s discretion. Any contingent truth\nwhatsoever depends on God\u2019s will.\n\nAccording to Scotus, God of course is aware of all contingent\npropositions. Now God gets to assign the truth values to those\npropositions. For example, \u201cUnicorns exist\u201d is a\ncontingent proposition. Therefore, it is up to God\u2019s will\nwhether that proposition will be true or false. The same goes for\ncontingent moral propositions. Take any such proposition and call it\nL, and call the opposite of L, not-L. Both\nL and not-L are contingent propositions. God can\nmake either of them true, but he can\u2019t make both of them true,\nsince they are contradictories. Suppose that God wills L.\nL is now part of the moral law. How do we explain why God\nwilled L rather than not-L? Scotus says we\ncan\u2019t. God\u2019s will with respect to contingent propositions\nis unqualifiedly free. So while there might be some reasons why God\nchose the laws he chose, there is no fully adequate reason, no total\nexplanation. If there were a total explanation other than God\u2019s\nwill itself, those propositions wouldn\u2019t be contingent at all.\nThey would be necessary. So at bottom there is simply the sheer fact\nthat God willed one law rather than another.\n\nScotus intends this claim to be exactly parallel to the way we think\nabout contingent beings. Why are there elephants but no unicorns? As\neveryone would agree, it\u2019s because God willed for there to be\nelephants but no unicorns. And why did he will that? He just did.\nThat\u2019s part of what we mean by saying that God was free in\ncreating. There was nothing constraining him or forcing him to create\none thing rather than another. The same is true about the moral law.\nWhy is there an obligation to honor one\u2019s parents but no such\nobligation toward cousins? Because God willed that there be an\nobligation to honor one\u2019s parents, and he did not will that\nthere be any such obligation toward one\u2019s cousins. He could have\nwilled both of these obligations, and he could have willed neither.\nWhat explains the way that he did in fact will? Nothing whatsoever\nexcept the sheer fact that he did will that way.\n\n(For recent criticisms of this strongly voluntaristic reading of\nScotus\u2019s account of the moral law, see Borland and Hillman 2017\nand Ward 2019.)\n5.2 The will, freedom, and morality\n\nScotus quite self-consciously puts forward his understanding of\nfreedom as an alternative to Aquinas\u2019s. According to Aquinas,\nfreedom comes in simply because the will is intellectual appetite\nrather than mere sense appetite. Intellectual appetite is aimed at\nobjects as presented by the intellect and sense appetite at objects as\npresented by the senses. Sense appetite is not free because the senses\nprovide only particulars as objects of appetite. But intellectual\nappetite is free because the intellect deals with universals, not\nparticulars. Since universals by definition include many particulars,\nintellectual appetite will have a variety of objects. Consider\ngoodness as an example. The will is not aimed at this good thing or\nthat good thing, but at goodness in general. Since that universal,\ngoodness, contains many different particular things, intellectual\nappetite has many different options.\n\nBut Scotus insists that mere intellectual appetite is not enough to\nguarantee freedom in the sense needed for morality. The basic\ndifference comes down to this. When Aquinas argues that intellectual\nappetite has different options, he seems to be thinking of this over a\nspan of time. Right now the intellect presents x as good, so\nI will x; but later on the intellect presents y as\ngood, so then I will y. But Scotus thinks of freedom as\ninvolving multiple options at the very moment of choice. It\u2019s\nnot enough to say that now I will x, but later I can will\ny. We have to say that at the very moment at which I will\nx, I also am able to will y. Aquinas\u2019s\narguments don\u2019t show that intellectual appetite is free in this\nstronger sense. So as far as Scotus is concerned, Aquinas hasn\u2019t\nmade room for the right kind of freedom.\n\nThis is where Scotus brings in his well-known doctrine of the two\naffections of the will (see especially Ordinatio 2, d. 6, q.\n2; 2, d. 39, q. 2; 3, d. 17, q. un.; and 3, d. 26, q. un.). The two\naffections are fundamental inclinations in the will: the affectio\ncommodi, or affection for the advantageous, and the affectio\niustitiae, or affection for justice. Scotus identifies the\naffectio commodi with intellectual appetite. Notice how\nimportant that is. For Aquinas intellectual appetite is the same thing\nas will, whereas for Scotus intellectual appetite is only part of what\nthe will is. Intellectual appetite is just one of the two fundamental\ninclinations in the will. Why does Scotus make this crucial change?\nFor the reason we\u2019ve already discussed. He doesn\u2019t see how\nintellectual appetite could be genuinely free. Now he can\u2019t deny\nthat the will involves intellectual appetite. Intellectual appetite is\naimed at happiness, and surely happiness does have some role to play\nin our moral psychology. But the will has to include something more\nthan intellectual appetite if it\u2019s going to be free. That\nsomething more is the affectio iustitiae. But one can\u2019t\nfully understand what the affectio iustitiae is until Aquinas\nand Scotus are compared on a further point.\n\nFor Aquinas the norms of morality are defined in terms of their\nrelationship to human happiness. We have a natural inclination toward\nour good, which is happiness, and it is that good that determines the\ncontent of morality. So like Aristotle, Aquinas holds a eudaimonistic\ntheory of ethics: the point of the moral life is happiness.\nThat\u2019s why Aquinas can understand the will as an intellectual\nappetite for happiness. All of our choosing is aimed at the human good\n(or at least, it\u2019s aimed at the human good as we conceive it).\nAnd choices are good\u2014and, indeed, fully intelligible\u2014only\nwhen they are aimed at the ultimate end, which is happiness. So\nAquinas just defines the will as the capacity to choose in accordance\nwith a conception of the human good\u2014in other words, as\nintellectual appetite.\n\nWhen Scotus rejects the idea that will is merely intellectual\nappetite, he is saying that there is something fundamentally wrong\nwith eudaimonistic ethics. Morality is not tied to human flourishing\nat all. For it is Scotus\u2019s fundamental conviction that morality\nis impossible without libertarian freedom, and since he sees no way\nfor there to be libertarian freedom on Aquinas\u2019s eudaimonistic\nunderstanding of ethics, Aquinas\u2019s understanding must be\nrejected. And just as Aquinas\u2019s conception of the will was\ntailor-made to suit his eudaimonistic conception of morality,\nScotus\u2019s conception of the will is tailor-made to suit his\nanti-eudaimonistic conception of morality. It\u2019s not merely that\nhe thinks there can be no genuine freedom in mere intellectual\nappetite. It\u2019s also that he rejects the idea that moral norms\nare intimately bound up with human nature and human happiness. The\nfact that God creates human beings with a certain kind of nature does\nnot require God to command or forbid the actions that he in fact\ncommanded or forbade. The actions he commands are not necessary for\nour happiness, and the actions he forbids are not incompatible with\nour happiness. Now if the will were merely intellectual\nappetite\u2014that is, if it were aimed solely at happiness\u2014we\nwould not be able to choose in accordance with the moral law, since\nthe moral law itself is not determined by any considerations about\nhuman happiness. So Scotus relegates concerns about happiness to the\naffectio commodi and assigns whatever is properly moral to\nthe other affection, the affectio iustitiae.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriTexLat\">Primary texts in Latin</a>", "<a name=\"PriTexEngTra\">Primary texts in English translation</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriTexLat\">Primary texts in Latin</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Cuestiones Cuodlibetales</em>.
