    "main_text": "Panpsychism\n4. Panpsychism\n\nCavendish does not think that thinking is restricted to human brains\nand nervous systems. She argues that thinking takes place across the\nspectrum of creatures \u2013 from human beings to non-human animals,\nto insects and cells, and to all of creaturely reality. For Cavendish\nmentality is ubiquitous throughout the entire universe.\n\nFirst she cites what she takes to be obvious data about particular\nnon-human animals. She writes,\n\nthe knowledge of other Creatures many times gives information to Man:\nAs for example, the Egyptians are informed how high the River Nilus\nwill rise by the Crocodil\u2019s building her nest higher or lower,\nwhich shews, that those Creatures fore-see or fore-know more then Man\ncan do: also many Birds fore-know the rising of a Tempest, and shelter\nthemselves before it comes: the like examples might be given of\nseveral other sorts of Animals. (Cavendish 1668c, 297)\n\n\nThen she supposes that the same applies to insects like ants and bees\nand spiders. In what is basically an ode to the ant, she writes,\n\nA Company of Ants meeting together, chose the Root, or bottom thereof,\nto build a City; they build after one fashion, which is like a Hill,\nor half-Globe, the outside being Convex, the inside Concave; a Figure,\nit seems, they think most lasting, and least subject to Ruin\u2026.\nThey, being Wiser than Man, know Time is precious; and therefore\njudiciously order it, forecasting while they work, and taking up the\nwhole time with Contrivance\u2026. Likewise, they are careful of\nRepairs, lest Ruin should grow upon them; insomuch, that if the least\nGrain of Dust be misplaced, they stop, or close it up again.\n\u2026So their care and affection is not less to bury their Dead.\n(Cavendish 1671, 280\u201382)\n\n\nAccording to Cavendish, crocodiles and birds exhibit extremely\nsophisticated behavior that is guided by intelligence and mentality.\nSo do ants and other insects. And so do other creatures that we might\nsuppose are too primitive to think. She indeed supposes that cells and\nother microscopic creatures are mindful as well:\n\n\nthe Elemental Creatures are as excellent as Man, and\u2026 I cannot\nperceive more abilities in Man then in the rest of natural\nCreatures\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 147)\n\nLife and knowledg is animate matter, and is in all parts of all\nCreatures. (Ibid., 514)\n\n\nCavendish supposes that it is obvious that there is mentality\nin all creatures. She looks around; she sees it; and she describes\nwhat she takes to be in front of her.\n\nBut someone might object that it is only metaphorical to say that ants\nand spiders \u2013 or cells \u2013 exhibit mentality. Perhaps they\nare just a kind of machine, and Cavendish is anthropomorphisizing when\nshe insists (and projects) otherwise. So she also makes sure to back\nher contention with arguments.\n\nOne especially clever argument begins with the assumption that human\nbrains think. That seems fair enough. Then Cavendish argues that the\nonly way that human brains could think is if the elemental bodies that\ncompose the brain were also mental and perceptive. In effect, she is\nasking the question: if the physical elements that make up the brain\nare entirely non-mental \u2013 and exhibit no trace of mentality\n\u2013 how could they add up to a larger brain that thinks? If the\nbasic elements of the brain do not have any mentality at all, then\nthey could not combine together into a larger body that thinks. That\nwould be magic, and Cavendish is not going to appeal to magic in her\nexplanations of things. Non-mental elements could certainly combine\ntogether to compose a larger thing that is also not mental or minded.\nBut if elements combine together to form a brain that thinks, then\nthose elements must have some trace of mentality or\n proto-mentality.[25]\n She writes,\n\nI shall never be able to conceive, how senseless and irrational Atomes\ncan produce sense and reason, or a sensible and rational body, such as\nthe soul is\u2026. \u2018Tis true, different effects may proceed\nfrom one cause or principle; but there is no principle, which is\nsenseless, can produce sensitive effects; nor no rational effects can\nflow from an irrational cause\u2026 (Cavendish 1668d, 375)\n\n\nHere Cavendish is taking a stand on a critical question of the early\nmodern period \u2013 the question of how bodies would be able to\nthink if their most basic features did not include mentality of some\nkind. Many of her contemporaries argued that the most basic features\nof body are extensive features like size, shape and motion; they\nconcluded that bodies cannot think because there is no way to explain\nhow thinking would arise or emerge from building blocks that are\nutterly non-mental. Descartes is an example (Descartes 1644, I.53,\n210\u20131), as is Malebranche:\n\nCan a thing extended in length, width, and depth reason, desire,\nsense? Undoubtedly not, for all the ways of being of such an extended\nthing consist only in relations of distance; and it is evident that\nthese relations are not perceptions, reasonings, pleasures, desires,\nsensations\u2014in a word, thoughts. Therefore this I that\nthinks, my own substance, is not a body, since my perceptions, which\nsurely belong to me, are something entirely different from relations\nof distance. (Malebranche 1688, 6)\n\n\nFor Malebranche, \u201cthe ways of being\u201d of a body are\nrestricted to what can be understood as bearing relations of distance\nto other things. It is impossible to conceive of a thought as having a\nsize, or as being a certain distance from another thought or from a\nbody, so a thought is not a body or the property of a body.\n\nCavendish turns the debate on its head. In a nutshell, she argues that\nif elemental bodies do not exhibit an iota of mentality, then human\nbrains would not exhibit an iota of mentality. But human brains\ndo exhibit mentality. Therefore the smaller elemental bodies\nthat compose the brain exhibit mentality as well. Those bodies that\nmake up the brain have electrons and protons (although that language\nwas not yet available in the Seventeenth Century); they also have a\nkind of proto-mentality and perception.\n\nCavendish would then just need to appeal to the assumption that the\nbodies that make up the brain are not essentially different from the\nbodies that compose everything else. Or better put: she would\nneed to appeal to the assumption that the elemental bodies that\nmake up the bodies that make up the brain are not essentially\ndifferent from the elemental bodies that compose the bodies that make\nup everything else. She takes that assumption to be confirmed in the\nbehavior of the bodies that surround us. We might again consider bees,\nor ants, or the natural and highly sophisticated processes by which an\neyeball is produced, or the process of the formation of metal. She\nwrites,\n\nI cannot perceive more abilities in Man then in the rest of natural\nCreatures; for though he can build a stately House, yet he cannot make\na Honey-comb; and though he can plant a Slip, yet he cannot make a\nTree; though he can make a Sword, or Knife, yet he cannot make the\nMettal. (Cavendish 1664, 147)\n\n\nWe can create a sword, but we cannot create the metal that makes up a\nsword. Perhaps we can do it in the current day, but Cavendish would\ninsist that if so, nature figured it out first, and we are just\nimitating the skill of nature and following its lead. There is also a\nsense in which we can make a tree, but not really. We can certainly\nplant a shrub, or what Cavendish is calling a \u201cslip.\u201d But\nwhen we do that, we aren\u2019t doing all the productive work, and\nindeed the contribution on our end is fairly minimal. We put a seed or\nshrub in the ground and water it, and a tree eventually forms. All of\nthe real work is done by the complicated genetic and physical\nstructure of the seed or shrub, and if it did not have that structure,\nwe could water the thing all day long and nothing would grow. Two\npeople might also announce that they made a baby together, but\nthe same applies again: the real legwork is done by the sophistication\nof the reproductive organs and the infrastructure by which nutrition\nis redistributed to the growing fetus \u2013 for example through the\nplacenta. A human being forms, and it consists of things like the\nhuman eye, which is about as intricate an entity as could be. Perhaps\nwe have caught up to nature in some instances \u2013 for\nexample we can now create synthetic seeds that become plants\n\u2013 but again Cavendish would insist that in such a case we are\nimitating the wisdom of nature and that nature figured it out first.\nBut we still cannot make a human eye or much else that nature has been\nmanufacturing seamlessly and skillfully for eons.\n\nCavendish accordingly concludes that the wisdom that is exhibited in\nnatural bodies is often of a higher order than the wisdom that is\nexhibited in human beings. Indeed we are at our best when we imitate\nnature:\n\nNatural reason is above artific[e]: wherefore those Arts are the best\nand surest Informers, that alter Nature least, and they the greatest\ndeluders that alter Nature most. (Cavendish 1668a, 12\u201313)\n\n\nNon-human bodies are intelligent and creative, according to Cavendish,\nand they communicate with each other in the course of bringing about\nimpressive and coordinated feats. She writes,\n\nit is well to be observed, that there being an entercourse and\ncommerce, as also an acquaintance and agreement between parts and\nparts, there must also of necessity be some knowledg or perception\nbetwixt them. that is, one part must be able to perceive another part,\nand the actions of that same part; for wheresoever is life and\nknowledg, that is, sense and reason, there is also perception; and\nthough no part of Nature can have an absolute knowledg, yet it is\nneither absolutely ignorant, but it has a particular knowledge, and\nparticular perceptions, according to the nature of its own innate and\ninterior figure. (Ibid., 165)\n\n\nThe bodies that compose an artifact are also natural bodies, of\ncourse, and so they have a history of perception and communication\nwith the bodies with which they are standardly continguous, but human\nartifice is often a matter of extracting such bodies from their normal\ncontext and putting them in a position that is foreign and unfamiliar.\nThese bodies are still perceptive, but the combinations into which\nthey are forced to enter are not as well-functioning. An everyday\nexample that might shed light on Cavendish\u2019s thinking here is the\ndifference between an office staff of individuals who have a long\nhistory of working together and a group of office workers that was\njust recently assembled. Statistically speaking the first group would\nbe able to get a lot more done. Or perhaps a better example is Muppet\nMan.\n\nCavendish would also appeal to the order that is exhibited throughout\nthe natural world as evidence for her view that thinking is\nubiquitous. As we have seen, she holds that bodies do not exhibit\norderly behavior unless they are guided by intelligence and mentality.\nOrder is exhibited throughout nature, and so mentality abounds.\n\nNote however that Cavendish is not thereby committed to the view that\nnon-human creatures exhibit the same kind of thinking as human beings.\nShe writes that\n\nthere are different Knowledges, in different Creatures; \u2026 they are\ndifferent Knowledges proper to their kind, (as, Animal-kind,\nVegetable-kind, Mineral-kind, Elemental-kind) and are also different\nKnowledges in several sorts: As for example, Man may have a different\nKnowledg from Beasts, Birds, Fish, Flies, Worms, or the like; and yet\nbe no wiser than those sorts of Animal-kinds. (Cavendish 1668b,\n163\u201364)\n\n\nShe then offers the same kind example that we find later in the work\nof Cudworth, who also held that thinking is ubiquitous in nature,\nthough he argued that thinking is immaterial. If we worry that it\nsounds odd to say that there is thinking in trees, cells, and other\nbodies that exhibit order, Cudworth notes that not all thinking is the\nhighly conscious and reflective variety that is showcased by\nDescartes. Instead, there is the intelligence that is exhibited by the\nfingers of the \u201cexercised lutonist\u201d \u2013 fingers that\nare able to create beautiful music without being conscious (Cudworth\n1678, 157). We might point to other examples of expert behavior that\nare more mundane \u2013 like driblling a basketball, or doing the\nsteps of a dance \u2013 where we do well when we proceed\nunthinkingly, but where get tripped up if we bring our behavior to the\nlevel of conscious attention. Anticipating Cudworth, and anticipating\nmuch-later philosophers who posit the existence of embodied\ncognition, Cavendish writes:\n\n[M]ost spend their time in talk rather then in thought; but there is a\nwise saying, think first, and speak after; and an old saying that many\nspeak first, and think after; and doubtlesse many, if not most do so,\nfor we do not alwayes think of our words we speak, for most commonly\nwords flow out of the mouth, rather customarily then premeditately,\njust like actions of our walking, for we go by custome, force and\nstrength, without a constant notice or observation; for though we\ndesigne our wayes, yet we do not ordinarily think of our pace, nor\ntake notice of every several step; just so, most commonly we talk, for\nwe seldom think of our words we speak, nor many times the sense they\ntend to; unlesse it be some affected person that would speak in fine\nphrases \u2026 . (Cavendish 1655, Epistle, unnumbered)\n\n\nSome of us might squirm at using an expression like \u201cmuscle\nmemory\u201d \u2013 if we think that (material) muscles cannot\nexhibit mental states. But for Cavendish phenomena like muscle memory\nare to be expected if bodies are mindful across the board.\n\nShe would add for good measure that although human beings do engage in\nconscious and reflective thinking, most of our thinking is not of that\nsort. A human being is composed of a very large number of bodies, and\nmost of these are involved in such orderly functions as the beating of\nthe heart, digestion, the absorption of nutrients, the disposal of\nwaste, reproduction, and the significant amount of communication that\ntakes place between cells. That is a lot of mentality, and arguably it\nis much more than the mentality that is constituted by episodes of\nconscious reflection. Cavendish even offers a clever argument to the\neffect that episodes of conscious mentality of a human being\npresuppose a torrential amount of unconscious cognitive labor that is\ntaking place behind the scenes.\n\nThe example of a conversation is especially telling, Cavendish\nsupposes \u2013 \u201cfor most commonly words flow out of the mouth,\nrather customarily then premeditately.\u201d In the course of a\nconversation a string of thoughts often just comes\nto us, and then we utter them. A similar example is that in which\nwe come to have a witty or clever idea in response to a situation that\nwe inhabit. It\u2019s not that we have the conscious idea already, among\nmany other conscious thoughts that are in our mind, and then we choose\nto express the one that has a high-relevance flag attached to it; the\nthought just presents itself. Or if we have many thoughts and one has\nattached to it the high-relevance flag, something attached that flag,\nand that is cognitive work. Or we might consider the case of the\nlate-night talk-show host who thinks of exactly the right thing at\nexactly the right time, though it is one of perhaps a hundred million\npossible thoughts in their wheelhouse. But they think of \u2013 and\nutter \u2013 just the one. Cavendish shines a light on the phenomenon\nby positing the existence of unconscious cognitive workers in the\nbrain that wisely select our thoughts and put them before our\nconscious mind. She writes (\u201cOf small Creatures, such as we call\nFairies,\u201d in Cavendish 1653a, 162):\n\n\nWho knows, but in the Braine may dwel\n\nLittle small Fairies, who can tell?\n\nAnd by their several actions they may make\n\nThose formes and figures, we for fancy\ntake.\n\nAnd when we sleep, those Visions, dreames we call\n\nBy their industry may be raised all;\n\nAnd all the objects, which through sens\u2019es get\n\nWithin the Braine they may in order set.\n\n\nCavendish does not suppose that there are actual winged fairies flying\naround in our brain. What she does suppose is that there must be a\ncause that puts before our mind the intelligent thoughts that we come\nto have \u2013 in the coherent and intelligent order in which we come\nto have them. Otherwise we would not have those thoughts, or we would\ncome to have them in an order that is jumbled and random. In the\ncourse of a conversation, and in the course of any train of thought,\nthere is something of which we are not aware that \u201cin order\nset[s]\u201d our ideas. This something is cognitive and perceptive\nand discriminating by nature. If a comedian or philosopher or witty\nperson is identified as intelligent for articulating a clever idea,\nthe process by which the idea comes to them is properly identified as\nintelligent \u2013 if not more so. But by hypothesis we are not\nconscious of that background process; we are just conscious of the\nthoughts themselves. The background process is quite intelligent,\nhowever; and we would be lost without it. Indeed, a fun exercise in\nwhich a person might engage is to notice when a funny quip comes to\nthem out of the blue, and ask how it arose. Cavendish would say that\nit\u2019s fairies, which are the intelligent (and hence mindful)\nentities that \u201cin order set\u201d our ideas. These engage in a\ntremendous amount of mental activity, and for every bit of conscious\nreflective activity that we count, there is at least one bit of\nunconscious mental activity (if not more) that makes it possible. And\nthen there is digestion, the absorption of nutrients, the disposal of\nwaste, reproduction, the significant amount of communication that\ntakes place between cells, etc. Just a fraction of the thinking that\ntakes place in a human body is of the conscious and reflective\nvariety, according to Cavendish, even if we think that kind of\nthinking is special and that it is the only kind of thinking that we\ndo. But conscious thinking is an outlier, and if so, at most a\nfraction of the thinking that takes place in nature is of the sort\nwith which we identify. The parts of a human body exhibit mentality\n\u2013 \u201cone part of a mans body, as one hand, is not less\nsensible, then the other, nor the heel less sensible then the heart,\nnor the legg less sensible then the head, but each part hath its sense\nand reason, and so consequently its sensitive and rational\nknowledge\u2026.\u201d (Cavendish 1664, 113\u201314). If a human\nhand or heel is composed of the same elemtental bodies that compose\nthe rest of the bodies in nature, then unconscious embodied mentality\nabounds.\n\nAnother philosophical tenet that bears on Cavendish\u2019s view on the\nubiquity of thinking is her view that nature is a plenum. If there\nwere empty space between bodies, then there would be no thinking that\ntakes place between bodies, but Cavendish holds that the notion of\nempty space is a fiction. In the regions that we call \u201cempty\nspace,\u201d there is air, for example, and in addition there are\nother bodies that are below the threshold of human perception. She\noffers a number of reasons for supposing that the universe is a\nplenum, including that nothingness can have no properties and that God\nwould not create non-being. She writes,\n\nan incorporeal dimension or extension, seems, in my opinion, a meer\ncontradiction; for I cannot conceive how nothing can have a dimension\nor extension, having nothing to be extended or measured. (Cavendish\n1664, 451\u2013452)\n\n\nmy sense and reason cannot believe a Vacuum, because there\ncannot be an empty Nothing; but change of motion makes all the\nalteration of figures, and consequently all that which is called\nplace, magnitude, space, and the like; for matter, motion, figure,\nplace, magnitude, &c. are but one thing. But some men perceiving\nthe alteration, but not the subtil motions, believe that bodies move\ninto each others place\u2026. (Cavendish 1664, 521)\n\n\nGod being not a Creator of Nothing, nor an annihilator of Nothing, but\nof Something, he cannot be a creator of Vacuum; for Vacuum is a pure\nNothing. (Cavendish 1664, 453\u2013454)\n\n\nCavendish will have to be careful about putting any weight on this\nlast argument, if she also holds that we have no idea of God and no\nideas of any immaterials more generally, but she does make sure to\noffer the additional argument that contains no theological premises.\nNon-being is nothing, she supposes, and in addition nothingness cannot\nhave any properties. The universe is a plenum of contiguous bodies,\nand these bodies are also perceptive and are in regular communication\nwith the bodies in their local environment. Cavendish is a panpsychist\nin the sense that she holds that all creatures exhibit mentality, and\nshe holds that there is no space that is not inhabited by a creature.\nAll creatures think, and there is no region of the universe that does\nnot exhibit mentality.[26]\n\nCavendish does make a distinction between three kinds of matter\n\u2013 rational, sensitive, and inanimate \u2013 and so it might\nseem that she allows that some creatures, for example inanimate\nbodies, do not exhibit mentality. She writes,\n\nThe truth is, nature considered as she is, and as much as our sense\nand reason can perceive by her various effects, must of necessity be\ncomposed, or consist of a commixture of animate, both rational and\nsensitive, and inanimate matter: for, were there no inanimate matter,\nthere would be no ground, or grosser substance to work on, and so no\nsolid \ufb01gures: and, were there no animate sensitive matter,\nthere would be no \u2018\u2018labourer,\u2019\u2019 or\n\u2018\u2018workman,\u2019\u2019 as I may call it, to form the\ninanimate part of matter into various \ufb01gures; such\nin\ufb01nite changes, compositions, divisions, productions,\ndissolutions, etc. (Cavendish 1668a, 157\u201358)\n\n\nThe basic idea here is that if all matter were rational\nmatter \u2013 of the sort that composes our ideas \u2013 then\nmacroscopic bodies would assemble (and also decompose) just as quickly\nas our ideas of those bodies, but they do not. In imagination we can\nquickly form an idea of a house or mountain or dragon, and then\nrecombine the components of that idea into an idea of something very\ndifferent, but in nature things are more slow. They are also more\nsteady. The three kinds of matter are more precisely \u201cdegrees of\nmatter\u201d (Cavendish 1668b,\n 4\u20135).[27]\n Cavendish supposes that all three are so intimately blended that\nthere is no region of matter that does not exhibit at least some\nmentality and perception (O\u2019Neill 2001, xxiii\u2013xxvi).\n\nPerhaps a final question that arises in the context of a discussion of\nCavendish and panpsychism is about artificial intelligence. Cavendish\nwould agree that a creature would never exhibit thinking if the\nelemental bodies of nature did not have features like thought and\nperception. In that circumstance, there is absolutely no chance, and\nno risk, that a computer would ever think, no matter its program, and\na robot would never think, no matter how complicated the arrangement\nof its parts. But Cavendish holds that the elemental bodies of nature\ndo exhibit thought and perception. There is no chance that a machine\nwould think just in virtue of the size and shape of the bodies that\ncompose it, but an artist or technologist might still create a\nthinking machine \u2013 not in virtue of its code or its wiring,\nbut in virtue of the mentality of the bodies that are blended with\nthem. As we will see, Cavendish has numerous reservations about human\nartifice. A twenty-first-century application of her view is to note\nthat (non-panpsychist) artists and\ntechnologists are being naive and reckless in\nany attempt to create a powerful and efficient machine\nthat merely simulates thinking; they lack a\nproper appreciation of what it is that is thereby combined.\n",
