    "main_text": "\n\n\nThat postmodernism is indefinable is a truism. However, it can be\ndescribed as a set of critical, strategic and rhetorical practices\nemploying concepts such as difference, repetition, the trace, the\nsimulacrum, and hyperreality to destabilize other concepts such as\npresence, identity, historical progress, epistemic certainty, and the\nunivocity of meaning.  \n\nThe term \u201cpostmodernism\u201d first entered the philosophical\nlexicon in 1979, with the publication of The Postmodern\nCondition by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard. I therefore give\nLyotard pride of place in the sections that follow. An economy of\nselection dictated the choice of other figures for this entry. I have\nselected only those most commonly cited in discussions of\nphilosophical postmodernism, five French and two Italian, although\nindividually they may resist common affiliation. Ordering them by\nnationality might duplicate a modernist schema they would question,\nbut there are strong differences among them, and these tend to divide\nalong linguistic and cultural lines. The French, for example, work\nwith concepts developed during the structuralist revolution in Paris\nin the 1950s and early 1960s, including structuralist readings of Marx\nand Freud. For this reason they are often called\n\u201cpoststructuralists.\u201d They also cite the events of May\n1968 as a watershed moment for modern thought and its institutions,\nespecially the universities. The Italians, by contrast, draw upon a\ntradition of aesthetics and rhetoric including figures such as\nGiambattista Vico and Benedetto Croce. Their emphasis is strongly\nhistorical, and they exhibit no fascination with a revolutionary\nmoment. Instead, they emphasize continuity, narrative, and difference\nwithin continuity, rather than counter-strategies and discursive\ngaps. Neither side, however, suggests that postmodernism is an attack\nupon modernity or a complete departure from it. Rather, its\ndifferences lie within modernity itself, and postmodernism is a\ncontinuation of modern thinking in another mode.\n\nFinally, I have included a summary of Habermas's critique of\npostmodernism, representing the main lines of discussion on both sides\nof the Atlantic. Habermas argues that postmodernism contradicts itself\nthrough self-reference, and notes that postmodernists presuppose\nconcepts they otherwise seek to undermine, e.g., freedom,\nsubjectivity, or creativity. He sees in this a rhetorical application\nof strategies employed by the artistic avant-garde of the nineteenth\nand twentieth centuries, an avant-garde that is possible only because\nmodernity separates artistic values from science and politics in the\nfirst place.  On his view, postmodernism is an illicit\naestheticization of knowledge and public discourse.  Against this,\nHabermas seeks to rehabilitate modern reason as a system of procedural\nrules for achieving consensus and agreement among communicating\nsubjects. Insofar as postmodernism introduces aesthetic playfulness\nand subversion into science and politics, he resists it in the name of\na modernity moving toward completion rather than\nself-transformation.\n",
