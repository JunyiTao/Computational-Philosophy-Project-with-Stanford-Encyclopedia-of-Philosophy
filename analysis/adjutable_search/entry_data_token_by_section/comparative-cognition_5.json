    "main_text": "Eliminating Alternative Explanations\n2. Eliminating Alternative Explanations\n\nComparative cognition researchers often test hypotheses about animal\nminds through behavioral studies or experiments. These studies are\ndesigned to determine whether a species, group, or individual animal\nbehaves as one would expect on the assumption that a given hypothesis\nis true. Often these hypotheses specify to some degree the cognitive\nprocesses thought to underlie a given suite of behaviors. As\nShettleworth notes, researchers seek\n\n\nnot just to confirm that animals are (or are not) capable of doing\nsomething \u201cclever\u201d but to discover how they do\nwhat they do. (Shettleworth 2013: 4)\n\n\nIn this section, we consider the role that statistical nulls,\nalternative explanations, epistemic values, and non-epistemic values\nplay in the evaluation of hypotheses in comparative cognition.\n",
