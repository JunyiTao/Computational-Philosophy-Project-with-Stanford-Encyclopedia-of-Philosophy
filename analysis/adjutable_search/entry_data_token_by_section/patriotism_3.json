    "main_text": "Normative issues || Patriotism and the ethics of belief\n2.1 Patriotism and the ethics of belief\n\nWhen asked \u201cwhy do you love your country?\u201d or \u201cwhy\nare you loyal to it?\u201d, a patriot is likely to take the question\nto mean \u201cwhat is so good about your country that you should love\nit, or be loyal to it?\u201d and then adduce what she believes to be\nits virtues and achievements. This suggests that patriotism can be\njudged from the standpoint of ethics of belief \u2013 a set of norms\nfor evaluating our beliefs and other doxastic states. Simon Keller has\nexamined patriotism from this point of view, and found it wanting.\n\nKeller argues that whereas one\u2019s love of and loyalty to a family\nmember or a friend may coexist with a low estimate of the\nperson\u2019s qualities, patriotism involves endorsement of\none\u2019s country. If the patriot is to endorse her country, she\nmust consider her beliefs about the country\u2019s virtues and\nachievements to be based on some objectively valid standards of value\nand an unbiased examination of the country\u2019s past and present\nrecord that leads to the conclusion that it lives up to those\nstandards. However, the patriot\u2019s loyalty is not focused on her\ncountry simply because it instantiates a set of virtues a country can\nhave. If that were the case, and if a neighboring country turned out\nto have such virtues to an even higher degree, the patriot\u2019s\nloyalty would be redirected accordingly. She is loyal to her country\nbecause that country, and only that country, is her country;\nhers is a loyalty \u201cin the first instance.\u201d Thus the\npatriot is motivated to think of the patria as blessed by all\nmanner of virtues and achievements whether the evidence, interpreted\nobjectively, warrants that or not. Accordingly, she forms beliefs\nabout her country in ways different from the ways in which she forms\nbeliefs about other countries. Moreover, she cannot admit this\nmotivation while at the same time remaining a patriot. This leads her\nto hide from herself the true source of some of the beliefs involved.\nThis is bad faith. Bad faith is bad; so is patriotism, as well as\nevery identity, individual or collective, constituted, in part, by\npatriotic loyalty. This, in Keller\u2019s view, amounts to \u201ca\nclear presumptive case against patriotism\u2019s being a virtue and\nfor its being a vice\u201d (Keller 2005, 587\u201388).\n\nThis portrayal does seem accurate as far as much patriotism as we know\nit is concerned. Yet Keller may be overstating his case as one against\npatriotism as such. When queried about one\u2019s loyalty to\none\u2019s country, couldn\u2019t one say: \u201cThis is\nmy country, my home; I need no further reason to be\nloyal to it and show special concern for its well-being\u201d? This\nmight not be a very satisfactory answer; we might agree with J.B.\nZimmermann that \u201cthe love for one\u2019s country \u2026 is in\nmany cases no more than the love of an ass for its stall\u201d\n(quoted in Nathanson 1993, 3). But however egocentric, irrational,\nasinine, surely it qualifies as patriotism. (In a later statement of\nhis argument (2007a, 80\u201381), Keller seems to be of two minds on\nthis point.)\n",
