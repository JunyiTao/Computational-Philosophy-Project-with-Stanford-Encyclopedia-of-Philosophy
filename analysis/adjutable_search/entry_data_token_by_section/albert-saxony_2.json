    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n3. Natural Philosophy and Mathematics\n\nIt is this analysis of language together with a particularist ontology\nthat places Albert in the tradition of nominalism. This is combined\nwith an epistemological realism that emerges, e.g., in his analysis of\nthe vacuum. In certain respects, Albert\u2019s work is an extension\nof physical analysis to imaginary cases. Distinguishing, as Buridan\ndid, between what is absolutely impossible or contradictory and what\nis impossible \u201cin the common course of nature\u201d\n(Questions on De Caelo I, qu. 15), he considers hypotheses\nunder circumstances that are not naturally possible but imaginable\ngiven God\u2019s absolute power (e.g., the existence of a vacuum and\nthe plurality of worlds). However, even if we can imagine a vacuum\nexisting by divine omnipotence, no vacuum can occur naturally\n(Questions on the Physics IV, qu. 8). Albert refuses to\nextend the reference of physical terms to supernatural, purely\nimaginary possibilities. In the same way, one can certainly use the\nconcept of a point, although this would only be an abbreviation of a\nconnotative and negative expression. There is no simple concept of a\npoint, a vacuum, or the infinite, and although imaginary hypotheses\nprovide an interesting detour, physics must in the end provide an\naccount of the natural order of things.\n\nHistorically, Albert\u2019s reputation in natural philosophy is at\nleast as high as the one he had in logic. His commentaries on the\nPhysics, on De caelo or on De generatione et\ncorruptione are close to  Oresme\u2019s and\nBuridan\u2019s. He appeals to the authority of his \u201crevered\nmasters from the Faculty of Arts at Paris\u201d at the beginning of\nhis questions on De caelo. Even so, it should be noted that\nhis Physics was composed soon after 1351, before the final\nversion of Buridan\u2019s Questions on the Physics (between\n1355 and 1358). On some points we know that Buridan modifies his\npositions between the third and the final versions of his commentary,\nand we can presume that this is in response sometimes to Oresme\u2019s\nideas, but sometimes also to Albert\u2019s.\n\nOn some other issues, the oppositions remain strong between the two\nmasters. We have already seen that on the question of the status of\nthe category of quantity, then at the border of logic and physics,\nAlbert followed Ockham and distanced himself from Buridan by reducing\nquantity to a disposition of substance or quality. This move becomes\nevident in certain physical questions, e.g., in the study of\ncondensation and rarefaction, where Albert openly disagrees with\nBuridan by arguing that condensation and rarefaction are possible only\nthrough the local motion of the parts of a body, and without needing\nto assume some quantity that would have a distinct reality on its own.\nNevertheless, he defines the concept of a \u201clump of matter\n[materie massa]\u201d without giving it any autonomous\nreality, although it does help fill out the idea of a \u2018quantity\nof matter\u2019, which Giles of Rome had already distinguished from\nsimple extension.\n\nSimilarly, Albert is sometimes seen as standing alongside Ockham on\nthe nature of motion, rejecting the idea of motion as a flux\n(fluxus), which is the position Buridan had adopted. In\ncontrast to Buridan, Albert treats locomotion in the same way as\nalteration (movement according to quality): in neither case is it\nnecessary to imagine local motion as a res successiva\ndistinct from permanent things, at least if the common course of\nnature holds and one does not take into account the possibility of\ndivine intervention.\n\nConcerning the motion of projectiles, gravitational acceleration, and\nthe motion of celestial bodies, Albert\u2019s position is similar to\nBuridan\u2019s major innovation, i.e., the theory of\nimpetus, a quality acquired by a moving body (see\nBuridan\u2019s Questions on the Physics VIII, qu. 13, on\nprojectile motion). Like Buridan, he extends this approach to\ncelestial bodies in his commentary on De caelo, clearly\nfollowing its consequences in rejecting intelligences as agents of\nmotion and in treating celestial and terrestrial bodies using the same\nprinciples. Nevertheless, he formulates the idea of impetus\nin more classical terms as a virtus impressa (impressed\nforce) and virtus motiva (motive force). Albert makes no\npronouncements about the nature of this force, claiming that this is a\nquestion for the metaphysician. His work also mentions the mean speed\ntheorem, a method of finding the total velocity of a uniformly\naccelerated (or decelerated) body, which had been stated (though\nwithout being demonstrated) in Heytesbury\u2019s Tractatus de\nmotu, and also adopted by Nicole Oresme. Albert was part of a\ngeneral scientific trend which sought the first formulations of the\nprinciples of dynamics.\n\nHe shares with Buridan the theory according to which, to explain the\nfact that a part of the earth is above the water, we have to\ndistinguish, for the earth, a centre of magnitude and a centre of\ngravity, because of the evaporation of water, but also because of the\nrarefaction of a part of the earth under the influence of the solar\nheath (Quaestiones in De caelo, II, q. 25 and 28).  He\nexplained also a number of curious natural phenomena, taking\nparticular interest in earthquakes, tidal phenomena, and geology.\n\nAlbert wrote a treatise on proportions dedicated to the analysis of\nmotion, highly influenced by the treatise De proportionibus\nvelocitatum in motibus of Thomas Bradwardine. He explains in a\nsynthetic way the elements of the theory of proportions, applying this\ntheory to different motions (local motion, alteration, augmentation,\nand diminution). Motion is to be studied \u201cfrom the point of view\nof the cause\u201d and \u201cfrom the point of view of the\neffect\u201d. Like Oresme, Albert adopts the idea that motion varies\naccording to a geometrical progression when the relation of motive\nforce to resistance varies arithmetically. His treatise is less\ninnovative than Oresme\u2019s, but it is a clear exposition that was\nvery widely read.\n\nAlbert was interested in certain mathematical problems. In addition to\nauthoritative arguments and purely empirical justifications, his\nquestion on the squaring of the circle uses properly mathematical\narguments appealing to both Euclid (in the version of Campanus of\nNovarra) and Archimedes (translated by Gerard of Cremona). His most\noriginal contribution is a proposal to dispense with Euclid\u2019s\nproposition X.1, replacing it with a postulate stating that if A is\nless than B, then there exists a quantity C such that A<C<B.\n\nFinally, a treatise De maximo et minimo, considering the\nlimits of active and passive potencies, written in the tradition of\nthe Oxford Calculators, at the frontiers of logic and natural\nphilosophy.\n",
