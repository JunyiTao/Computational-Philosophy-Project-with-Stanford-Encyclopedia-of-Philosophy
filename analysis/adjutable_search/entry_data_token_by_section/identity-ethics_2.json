    "main_text": "Contemporary Accounts of Personal Identity || The Psychological View\n2.1 The Psychological View \n\n\nBy far the most popular view of personal identity, until quite \nrecently, has been a significantly amended version of Locke's \nrelational memory criterion. To make such a view plausible, though, \nthe three objections just detailed need to be addressed. Start, then, with \nButler's complaint that memory presupposes identity, that I can \nremember only my own experiences, so memory just reveals to me my identity\nrelation to some past experiencer and cannot constitute that \nrelation. Following Sydney Shoemaker (1970) and Derek Parfit (1984), \none can introduce a more inclusive memory relation, called \nquasi-memory, or q-memory, defined so that it does not \npresuppose identity. I have a q-memory of some past experience \njust in case that experience occurred to someone and my \nmemory of the experience was caused in the right sort of way by the \nexperience I now remember. Regular memory, then, would just be a \nsubset of q-memory (applying to ordinary instances when I was the \nperson to whom the remembered experience occurred), and q-memory \ncould be the relevant relation incorporated into the theory of \nidentity in a way that avoids Butler's objection.\n\n\nThe second objection was Reid's, about transitivity of identity in \nthe Brave Officer case. What gets Locke in trouble is that memories \nfade, so someone may no longer be capable of having direct memories \nof what is clearly his earlier life. But one may certainly have \ndirect memories of some past stage that itself had direct memories of\nan earlier stage, and so on, until every stage in the life is linked \nby a chain of overlapping direct memories. What one can then insert \ninto the criterion of identity across time is a  continuity \nof direct (q-)memories, so that the retired general is the same \nperson as the apple-stealer insofar as he directly remembers the \nexperiences of the brave officer, who himself directly remembers the \nexperiences of the apple-stealer. Of course, one direct memory of \nsome past experience won't be sufficient to establish identity, it \nseems. Suppose I volunteered to have your memory trace of walking in \nAntarctica implanted in me (and I myself had never been there), and I\nwoke up having that q-memory of walking in the bitter cold and deep \nsnow. Surely this would not make me you, even though there is a \ndirect memory connection between us, so theorists taking this route \nwill talk about the need for strong memory connections, \nwhere this just consists in a significant number of such connections \n(Parfit 1984, 205\u2013206, 219\u2013223). \n\n\nThe third objection was that someone could persist through a loss of \nmemory, a claim Locke's view denies. What can be done to render the \nLockean view more plausible, then, is to incorporate more \npsychological features than just memory into the identity-preserving \nrelation. So not only are there present-past relations of memory that\nare relevant to my identity, but there may also be present-future \nrelations such as intentions fulfilled in action, relations that \npersist across time such as beliefs, goals, and desires, and \nresemblance relations such as similarity of character.\n\n\nPutting all these replies together, then, we have The \nPsychological Criterion of Personal Identity: X at \nt1 is the same person as Y at \nt2 if and only if X is uniquely \npsychologically continuous with Y, where psychological \ncontinuity consists in overlapping chains of strong psychological \nconnectedness, itself consisting in significant numbers of direct \npsychological connections like memories, intentions, \nbeliefs/goals/desires, and similarity of character (Parfit 1984, \n207). We will see the meaning and importance of the \n\u201cuniqueness\u201d clause later.\n\n\nThis criterion of identity (and its variants) has been taken to fit\nparticularly well with our practical concerns, both self-regarding \nand other-regarding. For instance, what seems to matter for \nself-concern and rational anticipation is that my \npsychological life continue. Anticipation and self-concern\nare psychological states, as are their objects (future experiences),\nso a theory of identity that ties those states together by virtue of\ntying distinct stages of me together seems initially quite\nplausible. In addition, concerns having to do with moral\nresponsibility are also about the relations between various\npsychological states \u2013 including intentions to perform actions,\nmemories of past doings, desires and beliefs explaining actions, and\nso forth \u2013 and so if personal identity is a necessary condition\nfor moral responsibility, the Psychological Criterion provides a\nplausible and satisfying account of that condition: I cannot be\nresponsible for the actions of some person if I'm not the inheritor of\nthat person's psychology.\n",
