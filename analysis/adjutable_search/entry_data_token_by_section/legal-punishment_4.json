    "main_text": "Punishment as Communication\n5. Punishment as Communication\n\nPerhaps the most influential version of retributivism in recent\ndecades seeks the meaning and justification of punishment as a\ndeserved response to crime in its expressive or communicative\ncharacter. (On the expressive dimension of punishment, see generally\nFeinberg 1970; Primoratz 1989; for critical discussion, see Hart 1963:\n60\u201369; Skillen 1980; M. Davis 1996: 169\u201381; A. Lee 2019.)\nConsequentialists can of course portray punishment as useful partly in\nvirtue of its expressive character (see Ewing 1927; Lacey 1988;\nBraithwaite and Pettit 1990); but a portrayal of punishment as a mode\nof deserved moral communication has been central to many recent\nversions of retributivism.\n\nThe central meaning and purpose of punishment, on such accounts, is to\nconvey the censure or condemnation that offenders deserve for their\ncrimes. On some versions of this type of theory, punishment serves to\nexpress to the community generally (including the offender and victim)\nthe society\u2019s denunciation of or dissociation from the crime\n(see Bennett 2008; Wringe 2016). On other such accounts, the primary\nintended audience of the condemnatory message is the offender himself,\nalthough the broader society may be a secondary audience (see Duff\n2001: secs. 1.4.4, 3.2; Markel 2011).\n\nOnce we recognise that punishment can serve this communicative\npurpose, we can see how such accounts begin to answer the two\nquestions that retributivists face. First, there is an obviously\nintelligible justificatory relationship between wrongdoing and\ncondemnation: whatever puzzles there might be about other attempts to\nexplain the idea of penal desert, the idea that it is appropriate to\ncondemn wrongdoing is surely unpuzzling. Second, it is appropriate for\nthe state to ensure that such censure is formally administered through\nthe criminal justice system: if crimes are public wrongs, breaches of\nthe political community\u2019s authoritative code, then they merit\npublic censure by the community. (For other examples of communicative\naccounts, see especially von Hirsch 1993: ch.2; Markel 2012. For\ncritical discussion, see M. Davis 1991; Boonin 2008: 171\u201380;\nHanna 2008; Matravers 2011a.)\n\nTwo crucial lines of objection face any such justification of\npunishment as a communicative enterprise. The first line of critique\nholds that, whether the primary intended audience is the offender or\nthe community generally, condemnation of a crime can be communicated\nthrough a formal conviction in a criminal court; or it could be\ncommunicated by some further formal denunciation issued by a judge or\nsome other representative of the legal community, or by a system of\npurely symbolic punishments which were burdensome only in virtue of\ntheir censorial meaning. It can, of course, also be communicated by\n\u2018hard treatment\u2019 punishments of the kinds imposed by our\ncourts \u2014 by imprisonment, by compulsory community service, by\nfines and the like, which are burdensome independently of their\ncensorial meaning (on \u2018hard treatment\u2019, see Feinberg\n1970): but why should we choose such methods of communication, rather\nthan methods that do not involve hard treatment (see Christie 1981:\n98\u2013105; Boonin 2008: 176\u201379; Hanna 2008; K\u00f6nigs 2013;\nTadros 2011: 103)? Is it because they will make the communication more\neffective (see Falls 1987; Primoratz 1989; Kleinig 1991)? But one\nmight think that an account that relies on punishment\u2019s\ncontingent effectiveness in communicating the desired message begins\nto look more like the sort of consequentialist account of which\nretributivists are critical (but see Glasgow 2015: 611\u201320). And\nanyway, one might worry that the hard treatment will conceal, rather\nthan highlight, the moral censure it should communicate (see Mathiesen\n1990: 58\u201373).\n\nOne sort of answer to this first line of critique explains penal hard\ntreatment as an essential aspect of the enterprise of moral\ncommunication itself. Punishment, on this view, should aim not merely\nto communicate censure to the offender, but to persuade the offender\nto recognise and repent the wrong he has done, and so to recognise the\nneed to reform himself and his future conduct, and to make apologetic\nreparation to those whom he wronged. His punishment then constitutes a\nkind of secular penance that he is required to undergo for his crime:\nits hard treatment aspects, the burden it imposes on him, should serve\nboth to assist the process of repentance and reform, by focusing his\nattention on his crime and its implications, and as a way of making\nthe apologetic reparation that he owes (see Duff 2001, 2011b; see also\nGarvey 1999, 2003; Tudor 2001; Brownless 2007; Hus 2015; for a\nsophisticated discussion see Tasioulas 2006). This type of account\nfaces serious objections (see Bickenbach 1988; Ten 1990; von Hirsch\n1999; Bagaric and Amarasekara 2000; Ciocchetti 2004; von Hirsch and\nAshworth 2005: ch. 7; Bennett 2006, 2015): in particular that it\ncannot show penal hard treatment to be a necessary aspect of a\ncommunicative enterprise which is still to respect offenders as\nresponsible and rational agents who must be left free to remain\nunpersuaded; that apologetic reparation must be voluntary if it is to\nbe of any real value; and that a liberal state should not take this\nkind of intrusive interest in its citizens\u2019 moral\ncharacters.\n\nThe second line of objection to communicative versions of\nretributivism \u2014 and indeed against retributivism generally\n\u2014 charges that the notions of desert and blame at the heart of\nretributivist accounts are misplaced and pernicious. One version of\nthis objection is grounded in scepticism about free will. Free will\nscepticism holds that people\u2019s behaviour is the product of\ndeterminism, luck, or chance, and thus that we are not morally\nresponsible for our behaviour in the respects that would justify the\nideas that those who commit crimes are blameworthy and\ndeserve punishment (see Pereboom 2013; Caruso 2018). In\nresponse, retributivists may point out that only if punishment is\ngrounded in desert can we provide more than contingent assurances\nagainst punishment of the innocent or disproportionate punishment of\nthe guilty, or assurances against treating those punished as mere\nmeans to whatever desirable social ends (see s. 3 above; but see\nVilhauer 2013).\n\nAnother version of the objection is not grounded in free will\nscepticism: it allows that people may sometimes merit a judgement of\nblameworthiness. But it contends that the \u2018affective\u2019\naspect of blame \u2014 its realisation in negative reactive attitudes\nsuch as anger, hatred, and contempt \u2014 has pernicious effects\nwhen manifested in the criminal law: such emotion-laden blame fosters\nall-encompassing condemnations of offenders, rather than condemnation\nmerely of their crimes; and it has contributed to overcriminalisation,\noverly harsh sentencing, and mass incarceration. On this line of\nobjection, the state\u2019s response to crimes should focus not on\nretribution but on rehabilitation, treating offenders as morally\nresponsible agents but not blaming them (see Lacey and Pickard 2013,\n2015, 2018, 2021; for similar accounts, see Kelly 2018; Nussbaum 2016:\nch. 6).\n\nTo this second version of the objection to retributivist blame,\nretributivists may respond that although emotions associated with\nretributive blame have no doubt contributed to various excesses in\npenal policy, this is not to say that the notion of deserved censure\ncan have no appropriate place in a suitably reformed penal system.\nAfter all, when properly focused and proportionate, reactive attitudes\nsuch as anger may play an important role by focusing our attention on\nwrongdoing and motivating us to stand up to it; anger-tinged blame may\nalso serve to convey how seriously we take the wrongdoing, and thus to\ndemonstrate respect for its victims as well as its perpetrators (see\nCogley 2014; Hoskins 2020). What\u2019s more, on the sort of\ncommunicative retributivist account sketched above, treating offenders\nas responsible agents involves pointing out when they have done wrong\nand expecting them to take responsibility for their wrongful actions.\nIf taking responsibility for one\u2019s wrongdoing requires that one\nacknowledge it as wrongdoing, commit to reforming one's behaviour, and\nbegin to reconcile with one\u2019s community by making reparation for\nthe wrongdoing, then one might argue that emotions associated with\nself-blame (guilt, remorse) and others\u2019 blame (anger,\nresentment) play a central role in such a process.\n",
