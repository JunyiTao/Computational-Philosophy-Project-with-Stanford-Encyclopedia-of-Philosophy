    "main_text": "Nishida\u2019s Theology: the Finite Self meets the Absolute\n5. Nishida\u2019s Theology: the Finite Self meets the Absolute\n\n\nToward the end of his life, perhaps thinking of the significance of\ndeath for understanding individuality, perhaps re-considering the\ntheme of self-awakening as a kind of death and re-birth, Nishida\ndelved deeper into the relation between the individual finite human\nself and the absolute or God. In his view, this relation logically\ndefines the place of religion. Experientially it comes to the fore in\ndeath. We will consider the meaning of death first, then the nature of\nGod or the absolute in relation to the finite self.\n\n\nThe theme of personal death is absent in Nishida\u2019s early work on pure\nexperience and self-awareness, and mentioned only abstractly in essays\non the historical world and the self, for example: \u201cIn absolute\ndialectics, mediation as absolute negation is mediation as absolute\ndeath, living by dying absolutely\u201d (NKZ VII, 314). In the last\ncompleted essay, \u201cThe Logic of Place and the Religious\nWorldview\u201d (1945), Nishida is more experiential. Death is not an\nevent at the end of one\u2019s life but penetrates life at each and every\nmoment. It is the ever-present opening, so to speak, where one\u2019s utter\nfinitude can come to light. Insofar as this is the finitude of the\nindividual self, it also implies a logic of individuation where the\nrole of other relative selves is diminished. \u201cI am myself by\nknowing my own death\u201d (NKZ XI, 420) is both a declaration of\nexistential self-awareness and a statement of what makes me uniquely\nme. What makes me an individual is not merely my differences from\nothers nor my sameness with some essential core; it is precisely what\nmost makes me not me, what negates me, in any moment\nof action. In this context, death signifies the self-negation of the\nfinite self.\n\n\nIf death is an ever-present opening, the other side of that opening, so\nto speak, is the absolute. To die is to stand vis-\u00e0-vis the\nabsolute. In the discussion of the \u201cI-You\u201d relation, this\nterm appeared as the absolute other in one\u2019s interior; here it shifts\nto the absolute in contradistinction to finite beings. Nishida calls\nit God as well, but makes clear that he is not referring to a\npersonal, transcendent being. If transcendence is involved, it is a\ngoing beyond by going within. He also implies that it is not\nsynonymous with absolute nothingness. If relative nothingness as opposed to\nbeing is implied, it is in the verbal sense of self-negating. The\nabsolute \u201clives\u201d through its own self-negation and inclusion of the\nrelative self. It does not die in the sense that relative beings do,\nfor it embraces all others whereas they, by being individual, exclude\nothers. God cannot be wholly transcendent to or exclusive of the\nself or the world. Even Nishida\u2019s early work, An Inquiry Into the\nGood , had spoken of God in a way that undermined the notion of a\ntranscendent being outside the world; it conceived of God as the\ninfinite activity of unification at work behind the articulations of\nspirit and nature out of pure experience.\n \n\nIn his final essay, Nishida\nadmits that his notion of an absolute totally embracing the relative,\neven in its diabolical forms, is more in tune with a Mahayana Buddhist\ntradition than with the Christian sources that also inspired him. To\nexpress the relation between a God and the relative finite self,\nNishida introduces a new term, \u201cinverse correlation\u201d(gyaku tai\u014d). This relation is another instance of\nopposites held together in a unity, a kind of \u201cself-identity of\ncontradictories,\u201d but this time not a symmetrical one. The more\none faces one\u2019s death, the negation of one\u2019s life as an individual,\nthe more acutely one is self-aware as an individual. The closer the\nfinite self approaches God, the stronger the difference between them\nbecomes. This peculiar kind of relation implies that God and the\nrelative self are inseparable but asymmetrically co-dependent. God or the absolute embraces and never excludes the human or relative, and the relative self never coincides with or dissolves into God. Nishida\u2019s inverse correlation is perhaps comparable to some theological notions of non-reciprocal dependence, where for example it is said that God is my being yet I am not God\u2019s being. But in Nishida\u2019s case, insofar as the distinction entails an undifferentiated source of their\ndifference, an absolute nothingness, the more that source is\ncontacted the stronger the distinction holds. \n",
