    "main_text": "Dance, Lived Experience and Somatic Awareness || The Primacy of Practice\n3.1 The Primacy of Practice\n\nThose philosophers, some of whom are mentioned above, who treat lived\nexperience as legitimate descriptive and explanatory evidence are\nfirmly committed to the validity of practice in philosophy of dance.\nAnalytic aesthetics philosophers, however (such as D. Davies and\nMontero), often find it necessarily to legitimize their recourse to\npractice in an explicit way. D. Davies\u2019 view is that ontologies\nof art should operate under a \u201cpragmatic constraint\u201d that\ntethers their views to what can be demonstrated in practice (2009).\nMontero\u2019s is that there is empirical evidence to support the\nidea that practitioners are experts in their domain of practice (see\n2012, 2013, and 2016).\n\nJulie Van Camp and Renee Conroy have argued that analytic dance\naesthetics needs to be more reflective of and responsive to actual\ndanceworld and artworld practice. Van Camp has proposed \n\n\nthat the identity of works of art [including dance] be understood\npragmatically as ways of talking and acting by the various communities\nof the art world. (2006: 42) \n\n\nConroy (2013b) has instead of a definition provided an argument for\nwhat she calls three \u201cminimal desiderata\u201d for an adequate\naccount of dancework identity, two of which require that any theory be\nresponsive to and applicable in danceworld practice, and one that\nrequires that criteria of metaphysical adequacy be met. (For an\naccount of practice as dance research see Pakes 2003 and 2017a.)\n",
