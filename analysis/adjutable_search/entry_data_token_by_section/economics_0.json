    "main_text": "Introduction: What is Economics?\n1. Introduction: What is Economics?\n\nBoth the definition and the precise domain of economics are subjects\nof controversy within philosophy of economics. At first glance, the\ndifficulties in defining economics may not appear serious. Economics\nis, after all, concerned with aspects of the production, exchange,\ndistribution, and consumption of commodities and services. But this\nclaim and the terms it contains are vague; and it is arguable that\neconomics is relevant to a great deal more. It helps to approach the\nquestion, \u201cWhat is economics?\u201d historically, before\nturning to comments on contemporary features of the discipline.\n",
