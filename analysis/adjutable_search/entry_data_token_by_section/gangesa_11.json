    "main_text": "Inference || How entailments are known\n5.2 How entailments are known\n\nInferences put forth for others (par\u00e2rtha) make plain\nthe conditions that work with oneself (sv\u00e2rtha)\nautomatically, and in texts of philosophy little is automatic. Thus\nbuilt into the conception of the operation of inference are the\ninductive procedures whereby a pervasion is known. Putatively similar\ninstances, sapak\u1e63a, are defined as cases known to\npossess the probandum and thus should also, at least in one (as first\ninsisted by the Buddhist Dign\u0101ga), exhibit the prover (e.g.,\n\\(Hb\\) and \\(Sb\\))\u2014while putatively dissimilar instances,\nvipak\u1e63a, are defined as cases known not to possess the\nprobandum and thus should lack the prover, too (e.g., \\(\\neg Sc\\) and\n\\(\\neg Hc\\)). The example, d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta,\nis normally a single instance of sapak\u1e63a where the\nprover also occurs (\\(Hb\\) and \\(Sb\\)), its citing thus indicating\nthat there is inductive support. In other words, by reference to cases\nthat are sapak\u1e63a \u2014i.e., known instances of the\nprobandum\u2014where the prover is also found, positive evidence is\nmarshalled to support an inference-underpinning pervasion\n(anvaya, \u201cpositive correlation\u201d). And by\nreference to cases that are vipak\u1e63a \u2014i.e., known\ninstances of the absence of the probandum\u2014further support is\ngarnered by our not finding the prover (vyatireka,\n\u201cnegative correlation\u201d). Citing an example is shorthand to\nindicate that such a procedure supports assertion of a\nvy\u0101pti, \u201cpervasion\u201d or general rule.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba devotes several sections of the\nJewel\u2019s inference chapter to elucidating inferences\nbased on both sapak\u1e63a and vipak\u1e63a, as\nwell as those based exclusively on sapak\u1e63a\n(\u201cpositive-only inference\u201d) and exclusively on\nvipak\u1e63a (\u201cnegative-only inference\u201d). In\ngeneral, it is \u201cwide experience,\u201d\nbh\u016byo-dar\u015bana, that is responsible for\npervasion-knowledge. But this term, championed by Udayana, and others,\nis vague, and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba devotes several sections to inductive\nmethod.\n\nThere is also \u201chypothetical reasoning,\u201d tarka,\nwhich, although not itself a knowledge source, is said to be able to\nshift the balance of what it is rational to accept. Its main role is\nto help people grasp pervasions, and is an important supplement to the\ninferences that are central to philosophic controversies.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba explains tarka as a hypothetical argument\nrevealing a fallacy or defeater with respect to a position\n\u223cp opposed to another position p that is to be\naccepted so long as p has independent evidence in its favor,\ntechnically called, pratik\u016bla-tarka. There is, however,\nalso anuk\u016bla-tarka, \u201csupportive reasoning,\u201d\nsuch as economy of conception, that is positive in character. The\ntypes of tarka that Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba recognizes are: (1)\n\u0101tm\u00e2\u015braya, \u201cself-dependence\u201d\n(begging the question), (2) anyony\u00e2\u015braya,\n\u201cmutual dependence\u201d (mutual presupposition), (3)\ncakraka, \u201ccircularity\u201d (reasoning in a circle),\n(4) anavasth\u0101 \u201cinfinite regress,\u201d (5)\nani\u1e63\u1e6da-prasa\u1e45ga, \u201cunwanted\nconsequence\u201d (contradiction), (6)\nprathama-upasthitatva, \u201cbeing presupposed by the\nother,\u201d the \u201cfirst established\u201d (a form of\nanuk\u016bla, \u201cfavorable,\u201d tarka), (7)\nutsarga, \u201chasty generalization,\u201d (8)\nvinigaman\u0101-viraha, \u201cdifferentiation\nfailure,\u201d (9) l\u0101ghava, \u201ceconomy of\nconception,\u201d \u201ctheoretic lightness\u201d (another form of\nfavorable tarka), and (10) gaurava, \u201clack of\neconomy of conception,\u201d \u201ctheoretic heaviness\u201d\n(Bagchi 1951: 151).\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba devotes a section of his inference chapter to\ntarka where he shows \u201cpragmatic contradiction\u201d\nalso to be included, which was mentioned above in connection with his\nrejection of skepticism and defense of knowledge as the default for\nawareness. That passage begins (2020: 649):\n\n\nAs an example, consider the particular doubt about smoke as pervaded\nby fire. If smoke is not produced from a set of causes excluding fire,\nthen smoke, as not produced from a causal complex including fire,\nwould not be produced (a conclusion in contradiction, presumably, with\nthe doubter\u2019s belief that smoke is produced). Now doubt (against\nthis hypothetical reasoning): Could the smoke come to be from\nsomething that is not fire? Or just in some instances could it come to\nbe without fire? Or could it come to be simply by chance\n(ahetuka, \u201cwithout a cause\u201d)?\n\nWere a subject \\(M\\) who has ascertained thoroughgoing positive\ncorrelations (\\(S\\) where \\(H\\)) and negative correlations (where no\n\\(S\\), no \\(H\\)), to doubt that an effect might arise without a cause,\nthen\u2014to take up the example of smoke and fire\u2014why should\n\\(M\\), as \\(M\\) does in a rulewise manner, resort to fire for smoke,\nto food to allay hunger, and to speech to communicate to another\nperson?\n\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba argues that tarka is useful for\u2014as\nwe might say these days\u2014re\u00ebstablishing a presumption of\ntruth in favor of one or another thesis brought into doubt. For\nexample, by supposing the truth of an opponent\u2019s thesis and\nshowing how it leads to unacceptable consequences, one repossesses a\npresumption of truth, provided one\u2019s own thesis is supported by\nat least the appearance of a knowledge source and, further, that it\nhas not itself been ruled out. Thus tarka comprises arguments\nthat are not in themselves knowledge-generators but capable\nnonetheless of showing what we should and should not believe. In\nparticular, reasoning can show \u201cuntoward ramifications\u201d\n(prasa\u1e45ga) of not accepting a conclusion that is\nevidenced, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba says. Forms of tarka such as\nself-contradiction, infinite regress, and circular reasoning are\nemployed in the dialogic exchanges constructed in the Jewel\nand other works of later and indeed early Ny\u0101ya philosophy and,\nfor that matter, all the philosophic schools.\n",
