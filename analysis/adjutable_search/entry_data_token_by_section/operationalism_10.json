    "main_text": "Current relevance of operationalism || Operations as units of analysis of scientific practice\n3.1 Operations as units of analysis of scientific practice\n\nAs already noted, Bridgman\u2019s ideas first gained recognition in\nthe midst of the logical-positivist preoccupation with language and\nmeaning; therefore, operationalism was taken primarily as a doctrine\nabout meaning and, as such, shown to be inadequate. In that context,\nit was reasonable for most philosophers to abandon it. Bridgman made\nvarious attempts to get beyond the popular caricature of\noperationalism adopted by advocates and critics alike. These attempts\nnever received sufficient attention, but they offer some valuable\nlessons and show many productive directions in which his views can be\ninterpreted and extended.\n\nIt is useful to continue listening to his retrospective given in the\n1953 AAAS conference, quoted earlier. Bridgman tells us that what he\nadvocated was merely:\n\nan attitude or point of view generated by continued practice of\noperational analysis. So far as any dogma is involved here at all, it\nis merely the conviction that it is better, because it takes us\nfurther, to analyze into doings or happenings rather than into objects\nor entities. (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 76)\n\n\nAlready in his paper on \u201cOperational Analysis\u201d Bridgman\n(1938, 115\u2013116) had stated that in the attempt to understand how\nscience works, \u201cthe subject matter \u2026 is activity of one\nsort or another\u201d. He equated \u201cactivity\u201d and\n\u201coperations\u201d, the term \u201coperation\u201d only\naccentuating the directedness of the activity in question. In his last\ngeneral philosophical treatise, The Way Things Are, Bridgman\ncame back to this theme and stated that an operational analysis was\nonly \u201ca particular case of an analysis in terms of\nactivities\u2014doings or happenings\u201d, instead of analysis\n\u201cin terms of objects or static abstractions\u201d, or \u201cin\nterms of things or static elements\u201d (1959a, 3; also 1959b,\n522).\n\nIf we take our inspiration from this later Bridgman, we can take him\nas a guide for a new practice-oriented philosophy of science. We can\nput aside his reductive doctrine of meaning, his puritanical search\nfor certainty, and his ambivalent privileging of instrumental\noperations over other types of operations. What Bridgman started up\nbut never quite accomplished in a systematic and complete way was a\nphilosophical analysis of science in terms of activities. Operations\nprovide the philosopher (and the historian) of science with a very\nuseful unit of analysis: actions or events, as opposed to objects,\nstatements, beliefs, theories, paradigms, research programs, etc. The\nconcept of operation should provide an effective framework for\nincorporating certain highly valuable insights about the nature of\nscientific practice, including the ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953)\non language-games, Michael Polanyi (1958) on tacit knowledge, Marjorie\nGrene (1974) on the knowing agent, and Ian Hacking (1983) on direct\ninterventions in experimental investigations.\n\nIn order to develop Bridgman\u2019s operational analysis into a\nfull-fledged philosophy of scientific practice, there are some aspects\nof his thought that we need to develop and articulate further. First\nof all, as noted in Section 2.3 above, we need a clearer and more\ndetailed taxonomy of operations, without trying to say which types are\nbetter or worse at the outset. From this point of view it should not\nbe regarded as a problem or an annoyance that there are different\ntypes of operations. The categories offered by Bridgman are much too\nbroad, so we need to identify and describe specific and concrete\noperations, and also distinguish simple and elementary ones from more\ncomplex ones. For example, the operation of length measurement with a\nmeter-stick would be analyzable into the instrumental operations of\nalignment and concatenation, the perceptual operation of judging\nspatial coincidence, and the mental operation of counting. The\noperation of hypothesis-testing (in the \u201creceived view\u201d)\nwould be analyzable into the simpler operations of deductive\nprediction, experimental observation, and the comparison between\ndeduced and observed outcomes. In the understanding of these\noperations we would need a detailed account of the scientist as the\nagent who performs the operations; here we return to Bridgman\u2019s\npreoccupation with the free individual, but also in essential social\ninteraction with other individuals. A full understanding of operations\nwould require an understanding of the agent\u2019s purposes (partly\nbased on the fundamental aims of science), assumptions (including\nmetaphysical principles essential for the particular type of activity\nin question), and skills and capabilities (including the tacit\ndimension). If we can achieve such a thick description of the\noperations that constitute scientific practice, we would be able to\nmake good on Bridgman\u2019s promise that \u201cit is better,\nbecause it takes us further, to analyze into doings or happenings\nrather than into objects or entities.\u201d\n",
