    "main_text": "Interactivity || Display Variability\n4.2 Display Variability\n\nThat users are responsible for generating certain features of an\ninteractive work means that their displays, unlike those of\nnon-interactive works, can occur in a couple of different ways (Lopes\n2010: 37-38). The less standard of the two occurs when the displays of\nan interactive work are generated in a succession of states over a\nperiod of time, but where none of the displays can be revisited. One\nsuch example is Telegarden, a temporary work of computer art\nthat users accessed from a networked computer. The work was comprised\nof a table with an attached mechanical arm that dispensed water and\nfood for the plants via the users\u2019 inputs. As one may imagine,\nthe garden took shape in a variety of ways over the span of its\nexhibition, but each state of the garden, or its succession of display\nstates, could not be repeated. Although not common, videogames can\nalso exhibit this kind of display variability. Consider the\nexperimental game, Cube. For a limited time, players could\nexplore a large cube and its nested smaller cubes while racing to be\nthe first to reach the center. As with Telegarden, players\ngenerated different properties of the game displays by interacting\nwith it, but once a new display was generated, the previous ones were\ngone.\n\nThe more standard of the two variable structures for interactive works\nare displays that can be repeated, such as most net art and videogames\nthat can be accessed many times, from multiple locations, to generate\ndifferent displays. Although repeatable works are more common (at\nleast with videogames if not museum-housed works), more needs to be\nsaid about the changing properties of these works and how the\nrepeatability trait distinguishes interactive digital works from\nnon-interactive digital images.\n\nIf the display properties of digital images can vary from instance to\ninstance due to even slightly different settings on different devices\n(e.g., brightness, resolution, intensity), then the aesthetic and\nstructural differences of many works could be misconstrued as\ninteractive. Since the example just given is not an interactive work\nof art, it is worth looking more closely at what is going on with\nnon-interactive repeatable works versus interactive repeatable ones.\nConsider traditional performance works such as works of theater and\nmusic. Each performance might differ to a slight degree due to\ndifferent performers and other varying conditions of the environment,\nand these may certainly affect our aesthetic experiences each time.\nHowever, those changes, in principle, do not reshape the structure of\nthe performed play or song. In the same way, the subtle changes made\nwith a digitally displayed image do not change the structure of the\nimage-based work. Compare those slight artistic or aesthetic\nvariations to the display variability of interactive works. For\nexample, many videogames permit players to choose which route to take,\nquests to accept, characters to kill or save, personalities to adopt,\nand the like. These sorts of in-game player choices are not merely\ngenerating features such as varying the brightness or resolution, nor\nare they as straightforwardly interactive as a game of chess that ends\nin a win or a loss. Rather, the degree of variability permits multiple\nendings. Again for comparison, while traditional tragedies will always\nend on a tragic note, some highly variable works can end either on a\ntragic note or on one that is not at all tragic.\n\nTo articulate the above more clearly, Dominic Preston says,\n\n\nfor any given artwork, each possible set of structural and aesthetic\nproperties F is a display type of that artwork. (Preston\n2014: 271, original emphasis).\n\n\nFrom the above, we can briefly infer the following scenarios: works\nlike digital photographs are ontologically similar to plays and music\nbecause they consist of one prescribed display type. While the display\ntype might permit multiple displays (duplicates, performances,\ninstances, etc.) consisting of subtle variances between the particular\ntokens, there is still a single correct display that should be\nmaintained or achieved. Works that instance a succession of states\nsuch as Telegarden and Cube consist of multiple\npotential display types where only one display type is instantiated at\nany given time. Now, compare such works with those like videogames\nthat present us with the strong degrees of display variability\nmentioned earlier. Because some repeatable works can end drastically\ndifferently from one \u201cplaythrough\u201d to the next, there is\nno singular, correct display. Instead, these sorts of works consist of\nboth multiple display types and multiple displays, which means users\nwill generate one of the possible display types (and their displays)\neach time they repeat the work.\n\nAccording to Katherine Thomson-Jones (2021), there is a problem with\nPreston\u2019s claim that interactive artworks \u2014 at least ones\nthat are digital \u2014 have multiple display types, as well as\nmultiple displays. This is because the digital is inherently\nreplicable and replicability requires a transmissible display \u2014\na single display type that can have multiple, interchangeable\ninstances. This seems to introduce a problem of incompatibility: How\ncan we have an image whose instances still count as instances of the\nsame image-based work when those instances, in virtue of users\u2019\nactions, look very different from one another? There are various ways\none might overcome this problem \u2014 for example, by distinguishing\nbetween the display of an image and the display of an artwork that\nincorporates the image in question. Preston\u2019s distinction\nbetween display and display type can continue to play a role here.\nWhile the concept of interactivity with high variability is mostly\napplicable to videogames, one can imagine interactive digital\ninstallations, net art, and table-top roleplaying games to which it\nalso applies.\n\nIt is important to reiterate that the strong interactivity just\ndescribed is not restricted to the digital. Whilst interactivity is a\nstandard feature of many contemporary digital works, and the\nresponsiveness of such works is remarkable, non-digital appreciative\ncategories can also exploit a similar degree of display variability.\nFor example, literature, theater, and tabletop role-playing games can\nbe strongly interactive in ways similar to many digital artworks. What\nis unique about all such works are the ways in which things like\nimmersion, agency, identity, and fiction, to list a few features, are\nimpacted by interactivity, due to the user\u2019s role in the work\n(for more, see Robinson & Tavinor 2018; Patridge 2017; Meskin\n& Robson 2016).\n\nA noteworthy point about the concepts presented above is that they are\nall conceived with the norms of traditional art and art practices in\nmind, meaning, works of art that are predominantly object-based.\nHowever, as described, interactive digital works can be said to have a\n\u201cbehavior\u201d based on prescribed interactions. While\ntraditional artworks typically emphasize a work that is complete prior\nto audience engagement, interactive works emphasize the\nmoment-to-moment unfolding of the works by way of audience engagement.\nOne recent approach to the ontology of art suggests that interactive\nworks (among other kinds) are better conceived on a process-based,\nrather than on an object-based, model (Nguyen 2020). A key difference\nbetween the two models is that the former focuses on the user\u2019s\nactions and experiences or \u201cinward aesthetics\u201d, while the\nlatter focuses on the \u201coutward\u201d aesthetic features of the\nself-contained object (Nguyen 2020: 25). While a process-based account\nprioritizes the internalizability of a user\u2019s actions, it does\nnot completely give up the idea of an artistic object. Rather, it\nrenders the object\u2019s significance secondary insofar as any\nappreciation for a work\u2019s objecthood is in service to the\nactivities it permits (Nguyen 2020: 20).\n",
