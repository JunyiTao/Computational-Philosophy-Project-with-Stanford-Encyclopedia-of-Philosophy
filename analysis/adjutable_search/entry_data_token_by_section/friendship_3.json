    "main_text": "The Nature of Friendship || Shared Activity\n1.3 Shared Activity\n\nA final common thread in philosophical accounts of friendship is\nshared activity. The background intuition is this: never to share\nactivity with someone and in this way to interact with him is not to\nhave the kind of relationship with him that could be called\nfriendship, even if you each care for the other for his sake. Rather,\nfriends engage in joint pursuits, in part motivated by the\nfriendship itself. These joint pursuits can include not only such\nthings as making something together, playing together, and talking\ntogether, but also pursuits that essentially involve shared\nexperiences, such as going to the opera together. Yet for these\npursuits to be properly shared in the relevant sense of\n\u201cshare,\u201d they cannot involve activities motivated simply\nby self interest: by, for example, the thought that I\u2019ll help\nyou build your fence today if you later help me paint my house.\nRather, the activity must be pursued in part for the purpose of doing\nit together with my friend, and this is the point of saying that the\nshared activity must be motivated, at least in part, by the friendship\nitself.\n\nThis raises the following questions: in what sense can such activity\nbe said to be \u201cshared,\u201d and what is it about friendship\nthat makes shared activity so central to it? The common answer to this\nsecond question (which helps pin down an answer to the first) is that\nshared activity is important because friends normally have shared\ninterests as a part of the intimacy that is characteristic of\nfriendship as such, and the \u201cshared\u201d pursuit of such\nshared interests is therefore an important part of friendship.\nConsequently, the account of shared activity within a particular\ntheory ought to depend at least in part on that theory\u2019s\nunderstanding of the kind of intimacy relevant to friendship. And this\ngenerally seems to be the case: for example, Thomas (1987, 1989, 1993,\n2013), who argues for a weak conception of intimacy in terms of mutual\nself-disclosure, has little place for shared activity in his account\nof friendship, whereas Sherman (1987), who argues for a strong\nconception of intimacy in terms of shared values, deliberation, and\nthought, provides within friendship a central place not just to\nisolated shared activities but, more significantly, to a shared\nlife.\n\nNonetheless, within the literature on friendship the notion of shared\nor joint activity is largely taken for granted: not much thought has\nbeen given to articulating clearly the sense in which friends share\ntheir activity. This is surprising and unfortunate, especially insofar\nas the understanding of the sense in which such activities are\n\u201cshared\u201d is closely related to the understanding of\nintimacy that is so central to any account of friendship; indeed, a\nclear account of the sort of shared activity characteristic of\nfriendship may in turn shed light on the sort of intimacy it involves.\nThis means in part that a particular theory of friendship might be\ncriticized in terms of the way in which its account of the intimacy of\nfriendship yields a poor account of the sense in which activity is\nshared. For example, one might think that we must distinguish between\nactivity we engage in together in part out of my concern for someone I\nlove, and activity we share insofar as we engage in it at\nleast partly for the sake of sharing it; only the latter, it might be\nargued, is the sort of shared activity constitutive of the\nrelationship of friendship as opposed to that constitutive\nmerely of my concern for him (see Nozick 1989). Consequently,\naccording to this line of thought, any account of the intimacy of\nfriendship that fails to understand the sharing of interests in such a\nway as to make sense of this distinction ought to be rejected.\n\nHelm (2008) develops an account of shared activity and shared valuing\nat least partly with an eye to understanding friendship. He argues\nthat the sense in which friends share activity is not the sort of\nshared intention and plural subjecthood discussed in literature on\nshared intention within social philosophy (on which, see Tuomela 1995,\n2007; Gilbert 1996, 2000, 2006; Searle 1990; and Bratman 1999), for\nsuch sharing of intentions does not involve the requisite intimacy of\nfriendship. Rather, the intimacy of friendship should be understood\npartly in terms of the friends forming a \u201cplural agent\u201d: a\ngroup of people who have joint cares\u2014a joint evaluative\nperspective\u2014which he analyzes primarily in terms of a pattern of\ninterpersonally connected emotions, desires, judgments, and (shared)\nactions. Friendships emerge, Helm claims, when the friends form a\nplural agent that cares positively about their relationship, and the\nvariety of kinds of friendships there can be, including friendships of\npleasure, utility, and virtue, are to be understood in terms of the\nparticular way in which they jointly understand their relationship to\nbe something they care about\u2014as tennis buddies or as life\npartners, for example.\n",
