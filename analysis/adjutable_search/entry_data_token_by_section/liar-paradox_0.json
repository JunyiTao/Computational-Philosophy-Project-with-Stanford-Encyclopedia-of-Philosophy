    "main_text": "The Paradox and the Broader Phenomenon || Simple-falsity Liar\n1.1 Simple-falsity Liar\n\nConsider a sentence named \u2018FLiar\u2019, which says of itself\n(i.e., says of FLiar) that it is false.\n\nFLiar: FLiar\nis false.\n\n\nThis seems to lead to contradiction as follows. If the sentence\n\u2018FLiar is false\u2019 is true, then given what it says, FLiar\nis false. But FLiar just is the sentence \u2018FLiar is false\u2019,\nso we can conclude that if FLiar is true, then FLiar is false.\nConversely, if FLiar is false, then the sentence \u2018FLiar is\nfalse\u2019 is true. Again, FLiar just is the sentence \u2018FLiar\nis false\u2019, so we can conclude that if FLiar is false, then FLiar\nis true. We have thus shown that FLiar is false if and only if FLiar\nis true. But, now, if every sentence is true or false, FLiar itself is\neither true or false, in which case\u2014given our reasoning\nabove\u2014it is both true and false. This is a contradiction.\nContradictions, according to many logical theories (e.g., classical\nlogic, intuitionistic logic, and many others) imply triviality, that\nis, that every sentence is true.\n\nAn obvious response is to deny that every sentence is true or false,\ni.e., to deny the principle of bivalence. As we will discuss in\n \u00a74,\n some descendants of this idea remain important in current work on the\nLiar. Even so, a simple variant Liar sentence shows that this\nimmediate answer is not all there is to the story.\n",
