Stuart Newman (2003) argues that physical factors played a\nmajor role in the early evolutionary history of multicellular\norganisms. Living tissues undergoing development have properties of\nliquid-like \u201csoft matter\u201d, such as viscous flow,\nelasticity, surface tension. They are also\n\u201cexcitable\u201d,\n\n\nsimultaneously hav[ing] chemical, mechanical, and electrical\nproperties, they behave in a multiscale fashion, continuously and\nsimultaneously changing their composition and organizational\nproperties on several temporal and spatial scales. (2003: 96)\n\n\nThese material properties allow living tissues to be analyzed in terms\nof physical theories and constraints. Although developmental processes\nin organisms today appear to follow pre-determined genetic programs,\nphysical forces and constraints are at the origin of developmental\nsystems and still play a vital role within them.\n\nNewman\u2019s theoretical approach \u201clink[s] the modern physics\nof materials with contemporary knowledge of genetic\ndeterminants\u201d (2014: 107; see also Newman 2003; Forgacs &\nNewman 2005). A core thesis of this theoretical approach is that\nexcitable soft matter can exhibit self-organization in the absence of\nany pre-existing program; e.g., synchronized oscillations, local\ndiffusion gradients, compartment-formation via cell adhesion. (This\ntheoretical approach is anticipated in the work of Brian Goodwin, see\n Section 9.2.)\n Newman posits that the earliest multicellular organisms underwent\ndevelopment spurred by these physical processes, together yielding a\nbasic body plan. Over long evolutionary timescales, gene regulatory\nnetworks are overlaid upon physics-driven self-organizing processes.\nThe result is a highly-conserved set of dynamical patterning modules\n(DPMs) that make basic shapes in a developing embryo: layers, lumens,\nfolds, tubes, segments, etc. Importantly, DPMs are not predetermined\ngenetic programs, but more inclusive systems capable of\nself-organization. Newman and colleagues use computer simulation to\nstudy the possible patterns generated by dynamical gene network models\nrepresenting DPMs (Salazar-Ciudad, Newman, & Sol\u00e9 2001).\nThis method brings in dynamical systems theory, which has recently\nbecome central to systems biology (see the entry on\n systems and synthetic biology).\n\nDynamical systems approaches to development, being committed to holism\nand temporal unfolding, echo classic epigenesis and early\ntwentieth-century organicism. These earlier ideas are brought to bear\non new high-throughput quantitative datasets using simulation\ntechnology\u2014updating and revitalizing the earlier systems\ntheoretic approaches of D\u2019Arcy Thompson and von Bertalanffy.\nAlthough most work in systems biology focuses on single-cell organisms\nand intracellular networks, some researchers look to dynamical systems\ntheory to construct a general theory of development. Following\nGoodwin\u2019s theories, Johannes Jaeger and colleagues seek to\nidentify a finite core set of basic developmental processes\nimplemented by genetic-epigenetic-cellular regulatory systems (e.g.,\nJaeger & Sharpe 2014). They use computer simulation of regulatory\nnetwork models to identify classes of geometrically similar networks\nthat perform specific functions (such as producing stripe patterns).\nThe goal is a rational classification scheme for\nfunctionally-characterized developmental mechanisms, which can in turn\nserve as groundwork for a general theory of development. It remains\nunclear, however, if biological functions in development can be\ncharacterized in a context-independent (modular) way, allowing for a\ntractable theory. Relatedly, Jonathan Bard (2011, 2013) posits a\nrelatively small set of developmental networks driving\n\u201cpatterning, signaling, proliferation, differentiation, and\nmorphogenesis\u201d, \u201cthemes used over and over again\u201d in\nnetworks of signaling pathways. Bard\u2019s graphical network\napproach is distinctive in cutting across spatial scales and levels of\nhierarchical organization. Core processes (as networks) are\ndistributed across levels; there is no preferred level of\ndevelopmental activity, but all involved simultaneously. The resulting\nnetwork structures are quite complex.\n",
