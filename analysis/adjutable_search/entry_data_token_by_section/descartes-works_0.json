    "main_text": "Early Years\n1. Early Years\n\nDescartes was born in La Haye on March 31, 1596 of Joachim Descartes\nand Jeanne Brochard. He was one of a number of surviving children (two\nsiblings and two half-siblings). His father was a lawyer and\nmagistrate, which apparently left little time for family.\nDescartes\u2019 mother died in May of the year following his birth,\nand he, his full brother and sister, Pierre and Jeanne, were left to\nbe raised by their grandmother in La Haye. At around ten years of age,\nin 1606, he was sent to the Jesuit college of La Fl\u00e8che. He\nstudied there until 1614, and in 1615 entered the University of\nPoitiers, where a year later he received his Baccalaureate and License\nin Canon & Civil Law. For the history and the text of his thesis,\nsee the following supplementary document:\n\nDescartes\u2019 Law Thesis\n\n\nIn 1618, at the age of twenty-two, he enlisted in the army of Prince\nMaurice of Nassau. It is not known what his duties were exactly,\nthough Baillet suggests that he would have very likely been drawn to\nwhat would now be called the Corps of Engineers (Baillet, Livre 1,\nChapitre 9, p. 41). This division would have engaged in applied\nmathematics, designing a variety of structures and machines aimed at\nprotecting and assisting soldiers in battle. Sorell, on the other\nhand, notes that in Breda, where Descartes was stationed, the army\n\u201cdoubled as military academy for young noblemen on the\nContinent\u201d (Sorell, p. 6). And, Gaukroger notes that the\neducation of the young noblemen was structured around the educational\nmodel of Lipsius (1547\u20131606), a highly respected Dutch political\ntheorist who received a Jesuit education at Cologne (Gaukroger, pp.\n65\u20136). Although the historical records point to there being a\nmilitary presence in Breda, there is no definitive evidence that\nspeaks for there being a full-fledged \u201cacademy\u201d. There are\nreasons for thinking that Descartes may have been a soldier, but the\nmajority of biographers suggest that it is more likely that his duties\nwere oriented more toward engineering or education.\n\nWhile stationed at Breda, Descartes met Isaac Beeckman\n(1588\u20131637). Notes that Descartes kept related to his\ncorrespondence reveal that he and Beeckman had become more than simple\nacquaintances\u2014their relationship was more one of teacher and\nstudent (Descartes being the latter). This relationship would rekindle\nin Descartes an intense interest in the sciences. In addition to\ndiscussions about a wide variety of topics in natural science, a\ndirect result of certain questions posed by Beeckman compelled\nDescartes to write the Compendium Musicae. Among other\nthings, the Compendium attempted to work out a theory of\nharmony rooted in the concepts of proportion or ratio, which (along\nthe lines of the ancients) attempted to express the notion of harmony\nin mathematical terms. It would not be published during\nDescartes\u2019 lifetime. As for Beeckman, Descartes would later\ndownplay his influence.\n",
