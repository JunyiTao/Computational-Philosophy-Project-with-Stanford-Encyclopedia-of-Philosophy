    "main_text": "Political Liberalism: Legitimacy and Stability within a Liberal Society || Stability: An Overlapping Consensus\n3.5 Stability: An Overlapping Consensus\n\nPolitical power is used legitimately in a liberal society when it is\nused in accordance with a political conception of justice. Yet the\nchallenge of stability remains. Legitimacy means that the law may be\nenforced, but Rawls still needs to explain why citizens are willing to\nabide by it. If citizens do not believe that they have reasons to\nabide by the law from within their own perspectives, social order may\ndisintegrate.\n\nRawls places his hopes for social stability on an overlapping\nconsensus. In an overlapping consensus, citizens all endorse a\ncore set of laws for different reasons. In Rawlsian terms, each\ncitizen supports a political conception of justice for reasons\ninternal to her own comprehensive doctrine.\n\nRecall that the content of a political conception is freestanding: it\nis specified without reference to any comprehensive doctrine. This\nallows a political conception to be a \u201cmodule\u201d that can\nfit into any number of worldviews that citizens might have. In an\noverlapping consensus, each reasonable citizen affirms this common\n\u201cmodule\u201d from within her point of view.\n\nHere is an example. The quotation below from the second Vatican\nCouncil of the Catholic Church shows how a particular comprehensive\ndoctrine (Catholicism) affirms one component of a liberal political\nconception (a familiar individual liberty) for its own reasons:\n\nThis Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to\nreligious freedom. This freedom means that all men are to be immune\nfrom coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of\nany human power, in such wise that in matters religious no one is\nforced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs. Nor is anyone\nto be restrained from acting in accordance with his own beliefs,\nwhether privately or publicly, whether alone or in association with\nothers, within due limits. The council further declares that the right\nto religious freedom has its foundation in the very dignity of the\nhuman person, as this dignity is known through the revealed Word of\nGod and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious\nfreedom is to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society\nis governed and thus it is to become a civil right. (1965, art. 2)\n\n\nCatholic doctrine here supports the liberal right to religious freedom\nfor reasons internal to Catholicism. A reasonable Islamic doctrine,\nand a reasonable atheistic doctrine, might also affirm this same right\nto religious freedom\u2014not, of course, for the same reasons as\nCatholic doctrine, but each for its own reasons. In an overlapping\nconsensus, all reasonable comprehensive doctrines will support the\nright to religious freedom, each for its own reasons. Indeed, in an\noverlapping consensus, all reasonable comprehensive doctrines will\nendorse all of a political conception of justice, each from within its\nown point of view.\n\nCitizens within an overlapping consensus work out for themselves how\nthe liberal \u201cmodule\u201d fits with their own worldviews. Some\ncitizens may see liberalism as derived directly from their deepest\nbeliefs, as in the quotation from Vatican II above. Others may accept\na liberal conception as attractive in itself, but mostly separate from\ntheir other concerns. What is crucial is that all citizens view the\nvalues of a political conception of justice as very great values,\nwhich normally outweigh their other values should these conflict on\nsome particular issue. All citizens, for their own reasons, give the\npolitical conception priority in their reasoning about how their\nsociety\u2019s basic laws should be ordered.\n\nRawls sees an overlapping consensus as the most desirable form of\nstability in a free society. Stability in an overlapping consensus is\nbetter than a mere balance of power (a modus vivendi) among\ncitizens who hold contending worldviews. After all, power often\nshifts, and when it does the stability of a modus vivendi may\nbe lost.\n\nIn an overlapping consensus, citizens affirm a political conception\nwholeheartedly from within their own perspectives, and so will\ncontinue to do so even if their group gains or loses political power.\nRawls says that an overlapping consensus is stable for the right\nreasons: each citizen affirms a moral doctrine (a liberal\nconception of justice) for moral reasons (as given by their\ncomprehensive doctrine). Abiding by liberal basic laws is not a\ncitizen\u2019s second-best option in the face of the power of others;\nit is each citizen\u2019s first-best option given her own\nbeliefs.\n\nRawls does not assert that an overlapping consensus is achievable in\nevery liberal society. Nor does he say that, once established, an\noverlapping consensus must forever endure. Citizens in some societies\nmay have too little in common to converge on a liberal political\nconception of justice. In other societies, unreasonable doctrines may\nspread until they overwhelm liberal institutions.\n\nRawls does hold that history shows both convergence in beliefs and\ndeepening trust among citizens in many liberal societies. This gives\nhope that an overlapping consensus is at least possible. Where an\noverlapping consensus is possible, Rawls believes, it is the best\nsupport for social stability that a free society can achieve.\n",
