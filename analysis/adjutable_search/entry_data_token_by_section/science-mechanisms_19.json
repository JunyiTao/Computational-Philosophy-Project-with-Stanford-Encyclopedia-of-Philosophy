Clearly, there are many ways of answering this question from\ndifferent metaphysical starting assumptions. And clearly, many\nmetaphysical starting assumptions rule this world picture out as\nillegitimate. The clearest path forward, it would seem, is to work out\nprecisely what one must be committed to in holding that the world is\ncomposed of a hierarchy of mechanisms and precisely what of that can\nbe recovered on the basis of different starting assumptions.\nThat said, not all applications of the mechanism framework require\na fully articulated metaphysics. Work on discovery and explanation\nmight proceed perfectly well without embracing any particular\nmetaphysical world picture. Philosophers with different interests\n(discovery, explanation, testing, reduction, emergence, and so) are\nlikely to elaborate the concept in different ways. There is every\nreason to doubt, that the idea of mechanism can be given a one-size\nfits all metaphysical analysis that will adequately address the\ndiverse philosophical ends to which the concept is being deployed.\n",
