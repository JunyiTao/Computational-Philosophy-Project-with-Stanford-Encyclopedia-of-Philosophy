    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Systematic Aesthetics or Philosophy of Art || The Particular Forms of Art\n6.2 The Particular Forms of Art\n\n\nHegel also acknowledges that art can, indeed must, both fall short of\nand go beyond such ideal beauty. It falls short of ideal beauty when\nit takes the form of symbolic art, and it goes beyond such\nbeauty when it takes the form of romantic art. The form of\nart that is characterized by works of ideal beauty itself is\nclassical art. These are the three forms of art\n(Kunstformen), or \u201cforms of the beautiful\u201d\n(PK\u00c4, 68), that Hegel believes are made necessary by\nthe very idea of art itself. The development of art from one form to\nanother generates what Hegel regards as the distinctive\nhistory of art.\n\n\nWhat produces these three art-forms is the changing relation between\nthe content of art\u2014the Idea as spirit\u2014and its\nmode of presentation. The changes in this relation are in turn\ndetermined by the way in which the content of art is itself conceived.\nIn symbolic art the content is conceived abstractly, such that it is\nnot able to manifest itself adequately in a sensuous, visible form. In\nclassical art, by contrast, the content is conceived in such a way\nthat it is able to find perfect expression in sensuous, visible\nform. In romantic art, the content is conceived in such a way that it\nis able to find adequate expression in sensuous, visible form and yet\nalso ultimately transcends the realm of the sensuous and visible.\n\n\nClassical art is the home of ideal beauty proper, whereas romantic art\nis the home of what Hegel calls the \u201cbeauty of inwardness\u201d\n(Sch\u00f6nheit der Innigkeit) or, as Knox translates it,\n\u201cbeauty of deep feeling\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 531).\nSymbolic art, by contrast, falls short of genuine beauty altogether.\nThis does not mean that it is simply bad art: Hegel recognizes that\nsymbolic art is often the product of the highest level of artistry.\nSymbolic art falls short of beauty because it does not yet have a rich\nenough understanding of the nature of divine and human spirit. The\nartistic shapes it produces are deficient, therefore, because the\nconceptions of spirit that underlie it\u2014conceptions that are\ncontained above all in religion\u2014are deficient\n(PK\u00c4, 68).\n6.2.1 Symbolic Art\n\n\nHegel\u2019s account of symbolic art encompasses the art of many\ndifferent civilizations and shows his considerable understanding of,\nand appreciation for, non-Western art. Not all of the types of symbolic\nart Hegel discusses, however, are fully and properly symbolic.\nSo what connects them all? The fact that they all belong to the sphere\nof what Hegel calls \u201cpre-art\u201d (Vorkunst)\n(PK\u00c4, 73). Art proper, for Hegel, is the sensuous\nexpression or manifestation of free spirit in a medium (such as metal,\nstone or color) that has been deliberately shaped or\nworked by human beings into the expression of freedom. The\nsphere of \u201cpre-art\u201d comprises art that falls short of art\nproper in some way. This is either because it is the product of a\nspirit that does not yet understand itself to be truly free,\nor because it is the product of a spirit that does have a sense of its\nown freedom but does not yet understand such freedom to involve the\nmanifestation of itself in a sensuous medium that has been specifically\nshaped to that end. In either case, compared to genuine art,\n\u201cpre-art\u201d rests on a relatively abstract\nconception of spirit.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s intention in his account of symbolic art is not to\ncomment exhaustively on every kind of \u201cpre-art\u201d there is.\nHe says nothing, for example, about prehistoric art (such as cave\npainting), nor does he discuss Chinese art or Buddhist art (even though\nhe discusses both Chinese religion and Buddhism in his lectures on the\nphilosophy of religion). Hegel\u2019s aim in his account of symbolic\nart is to examine the various kinds of art that are made necessary by\nthe very concept of art itself, the stages through which art has to\npass on its journey from pre-art to art proper.\n\n\nThe first stage is that in which spirit is conceived as being in an\nimmediate unity with nature. This stage is encountered in the\nancient Persian religion of Zoroastrianism. The Zoroastrians, Hegel\nclaims, believe in a divine power\u2014the Good\u2014but\nthey identify this divinity with an aspect of nature itself, namely\nwith light. Light does not symbolize or point to a separate God or\nGood; rather, in Zoroastrianism (as Hegel understands it) light\nis the Good, is God (Aesthetics, 1: 325).\nLight is thus the substance in all things and that which gives life to\nall plants and animals. This light, Hegel tells us, is personified as\nOrmuzd (or Ahura Mazda). Unlike the God of the Jews, however, Ormuzd is\nnot a free, self-conscious subject. He (or it) is the Good in the form\nof light itself, and so is present in all sources of light, such as the\nsun, stars and fire.\n\n\nThe question we have to ask, Hegel remarks, is whether seeing the Good\nas light (or giving utterance to such an intuition) counts as art\n(PK\u00c4, 76). In Hegel\u2019s view, it does not do so for two\nreasons: on the one hand, the Good is not understood to be free spirit\nthat is distinct from, but manifests itself in, the light; on the\nother hand, the sensuous element in which the Good is\npresent\u2014the light itself\u2014is understood not to be something\nshaped or produced by free spirit for the purpose of its\nself-expression, but simply to be a given feature of nature with which\nthe Good is immediately identical.\n\n\nIn the Zoroastrian vision of the Good as light, we encounter the\n\u201csensuous presentation [Darstellung] of the\ndivine\u201d (PK\u00c4, 76). This vision, however, does\nnot constitute a work of art, even though it finds expression\nin well-crafted prayers and utterances.\n\n\nThe second stage in the development of pre-art is that in which there\nis an immediate difference between spirit and nature. This is\nfound, in Hegel\u2019s view, in Hindu art. The difference between the\nspiritual and the natural means that the spiritual\u2014i.e., the\ndivine\u2014cannot be understood (as in Persia) to be simply\nidentical with some immediately given aspect of nature. On the other\nhand, Hegel claims, the divine in Hinduism is conceived in such an\nabstract and indeterminate way that it acquires determinate\nform only in and through something immediately sensuous, external and\nnatural. The divine is thus understood to be present in the\nvery form of something sensuous and natural. As Hegel puts it in his\n1826 lectures on aesthetics: \u201cnatural objects\u2014the human\nbeing, animals\u2014are revered as divine\u201d (PK\u00c4,\n79).\n\n\nHindu art marks the difference between the spiritual (or divine) and\nthe merely natural by extending, exaggerating and distorting the\nnatural forms in which the divine is imagined to be present. The divine\nis portrayed not in the purely natural form of an animal or human\nbeing, therefore, but in the unnaturally distorted\nform of an animal or human being. (Shiva is portrayed with many arms,\nfor example, and Brahma with four faces.)\n\n\nHegel notes that such portrayal involves the work of\n\u201cshaping\u201d or \u201cforming\u201d the medium of\nexpression (PK\u00c4, 78). In that sense, one can speak of\nHindu \u201cart.\u201d He claims, however, that Hindu art does not\nfulfill the true purpose of art because it does not give appropriate\nand adequate shape to free spirit and thereby create images of beauty.\nRather, it simply distorts the natural shape of animals and human\nbeings\u2014to the point at which they become \u201cugly\u201d\n(unsch\u00f6n), \u201cmonstrous,\u201d\n\u201cgrotesque\u201d or \u201cbizarre\u201d (PK\u00c4,\n78, 84)\u2014in order to show that the divine or spiritual, which\ncannot be understood except in terms of the natural and sensuous, is\nat the same time different from, and finds no adequate expression in,\nthe realm of the natural and sensuous. Hindu divinity is inseparable\nfrom natural forms, but it indicates its distinctive presence by the\nunnaturalness of the natural forms it adopts.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s judgment on Hindu art does not mean, by the way, that he\nfinds no merit at all in such art. He remarks on the splendor of Hindu\nart and on the \u201cmost tender feeling\u201d and the\n\u201cwealth of the finest sensuous naturalness\u201d that such art\ncan display. He insists, however, that Hindu art fails to reach the\nheight of art, in which spirit is shown to be free in itself and is\ngiven appropriate natural, visible shape (PK\u00c4, \n84).\n\n\nThe third stage in the development of \u201cpre-art\u201d is that of\ngenuinely symbolic art in which shapes and images are\ndeliberately designed and created to point to a determinate and quite\nseparate sphere of \u201cinteriority\u201d\n(Innerlichkeit) (PK\u00c4, 86). This is the\nprovince of ancient Egyptian art. The Egyptians, Hegel tells us, were\nthe first people to \u201cfix\u201d (fixieren) the idea of\nspirit as something inward that is separate and independent in itself\n(PK\u00c4, 85). (In this context he refers to Herodotus,\nwho maintained that the Egyptians were \u201cthe first people to put\nforward the doctrine of the immortality of the soul\u201d [Herodotus,\n145 [2: 123]].) Spirit, as Hegel understands it (in his philosophy of\nsubjective and objective spirit), is the activity of externalizing and\nexpressing itself in images, words, actions and institutions. With the\nidea of spirit as \u201cinteriority,\u201d therefore, there\nnecessarily comes the drive to give an external shape to this inner\nspirit, that is, to produce a shape for spirit from out of\nspirit itself. The drive to create shapes and images\u2014works of\nart\u2014through which the inner realm can make itself known is thus\nan \u201cinstinct\u201d in the Egyptians that is deeply rooted in the\nway they understand spirit. In this sense, in Hegel\u2019s view,\nEgyptian civilization is a more profoundly artistic civilization than\nthat of the Hindus (Aesthetics, 1: 354; PK\u00c4, \n86).\n\n\nEgyptian art, however, is only symbolic art, not art in its full sense.\nThis is because the created shapes and images of Egyptian art do not\ngive direct, adequate expression to spirit, but merely point\nto, or symbolize, an interiority that remains hidden from view.\nFurthermore, the inner spirit, though fixed in the Egyptian\nunderstanding as a \u201cseparate, independent inwardness\u201d\n(PK\u00c4, 86), is not itself understood as fully\nfree spirit. Indeed, the realm of spirit is understood by the\nEgyptians to a large degree as the simple negation of the\nrealm of nature and life. That is to say, it is understood above all as the realm\nof the dead.\n\n\nThe fact that death is the principal realm in which the independence of the soul\nis preserved explains why the doctrine of the immortality of the soul\nis so important to the Egyptians. It also explains why Hegel sees the\npyramid as the image that epitomizes Egyptian symbolic art.\nThe pyramid is a created shape that hides within it something separate\nfrom it, namely a dead body. It thus serves as the perfect image of\nEgyptian symbols which point to, but do not themselves reveal\nand express, a realm of interiority that is independent but still lacks\nthe freedom and life of genuine spirit (Aesthetics, 1:\n356).\n\n\nFor Hegel, Greek art contains symbolic elements (such as the eagle to\nsymbolize the power of Zeus), but the core of Greek art is not the\nsymbol. Egyptian art, by contrast, is symbolic through and through.\nIndeed, Egyptian consciousness as a whole, in Hegel\u2019s view, is\nessentially symbolic. Animals, for example, are regarded as symbols or\nmasks of something deeper, and so animal faces are often used as masks\n(by amongst others, embalmers). Symbolism can also be multi-layered:\nthe image of the phoenix, Hegel claims, symbolizes natural (especially,\ncelestial) processes of disappearance and reemergence, but those\nprocesses are themselves viewed as symbols of spiritual rebirth\n(PK\u00c4, 87).\n\n\nAs noted above, the pyramid epitomizes the symbolic art of the\nEgyptians. Such art, however, does not just point symbolically to the\nrealm of the dead; it also bears witness to an incipient but still\nundeveloped awareness that true inwardness is found in the living human\nspirit. It does so, Hegel maintains, by showing the human spirit\nstruggling to emerge from the animal. The image that best depicts this\nemergence is, of course, that of the sphinx (which has the body of a\nlion and the head of a human being). The human form is also mixed with\nthat of animals in images of gods, such as Horus (who has a human body\nand a falcon\u2019s head). Such images, however, do not constitute art\nin the full sense because they fail to give adequate expression to free\nspirit in the form of the fully human being. They are mere\nsymbols that partially disclose an interiority whose true character\nremains hidden from view (and mysterious even to the Egyptians\nthemselves).\n\n\nEven when the human form is depicted in Egyptian art without\nadulteration, it is still not animated by a genuinely free and living\nspirit and so does not become the shape of freedom itself. Figures,\nsuch as the Memnon Colossi of Amenhotep III in Western Thebes, display\nno \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d (PK\u00c4, 89), in\nHegel\u2019s view, and other smaller figures, which stand with their arms\npressed to their sides and their feet firmly planted on the ground,\nlack \u201cgrace [Grazie] of movement.\u201d Egyptian\nsculpture is praised by Hegel as \u201cworthy of admiration\u201d;\nindeed, he claims that under the Ptolemies (305\u201330 B.C.)\nEgyptian sculpture exhibited great \u201cdelicacy\u201d (or\n\u201celegance\u201d) (Zierlichkeit). Nonetheless, for all\nits merits, Egyptian art does not give shape to real freedom and life\nand so fails to fulfill the true purpose of art.\n\n\nThe fourth stage of pre-art is that in which spirit gains such a degree\nof freedom and independence that spirit and nature \u201cfall\napart\u201d (PK\u00c4, 89). This stage is in turn\nsub-divided into three. The first sub-division comprises\nsublime art: the poetic art of the Jewish people.\n\n\nIn Judaism, Hegel maintains, spirit is understood to be fully free and\nindependent. This freedom and independence is, however, attributed to\nthe divine rather than the human spirit. God is thus conceived as a\n\u201cfree spiritual subject\u201d (PK\u00c4, 75), who is\nthe creator of the world and the power over everything natural and\nfinite. That which is natural and finite is, by contrast, regarded as\nsomething \u201cnegative\u201d in relation to God, that is, as\nsomething that does not exist for its own sake but that has been\ncreated to serve God (PK\u00c4, 90).\n\n\nJudaic spirituality, in Hegel\u2019s view, is not capable of producing\nworks of true beauty because the Jewish God transcends the world of\nnature and finitude and cannot manifest itself in that world\nand be given visible shape in it. Jewish poetry (the Psalms) gives\nexpression, rather, to the sublimity of God by praising and exalting\nHim as the source of all things. At the same time, such poetry gives\n\u201cbrilliant\u201d (gl\u00e4nzend) expression to the pain\nand fear felt by the sinful in relation to their Lord\n(PK\u00c4, 91).\n\n\nThe second sub-division of this fourth stage of pre-art comprises what\nHegel calls \u201coriental pantheism\u201d and is found in the poetry\nof Islamic \u201cArabs, Persians, and Turks\u201d (PK\u00c4,\n93), such as the Persian lyric poet Hafez (German: Hafis) (c.\n1310\u20131389). In such pantheism, God is also understood to stand\nsublimely above and apart from the realm of the finite and natural, but\nhis relation to that realm is held to be affirmative, rather\nthan negative. The divine raises things to their own magnificence,\nfills them with spirit, gives them life and in this sense is actually\nimmanent in things (Aesthetics, 1: 368;\nPK\u00c4, 93).\n\n\nThis in turn determines the relation that the poet has to objects. For\nthe poet, too, is free and independent of things, but also has an\naffirmative relation to them. That is to say, he feels an identity\nwith things and sees his own untroubled freedom reflected in\nthem. Such pantheism thus comes close to genuine art, for it uses\nnatural objects, such as a rose, as poetic \u201cimages\u201d\n(Bilder) of its own feeling of \u201ccheerful, blessed\ninwardness\u201d (PK\u00c4, 94\u20135). The pantheistic spirit remains, however, free within itself in distinction from and in\nrelation to natural objects; it does not create shapes of its\nown\u2014such as the idealized figures of the Greek gods\u2014in\nwhich its freedom comes directly into view. (Note, by the way, that in the Hotho edition of Hegel\u2019s lectures on aesthetics pantheistic Islamic poetry is placed before, rather than after, the poetry of Judaism; see Aesthetics, 1: 364\u201377.)\n\n\nThe third sub-division of the fourth stage of pre-art is that in which\nthere is the clearest break between spirit and the realm of the\nnatural or sensuous. At this stage, the spiritual aspect\u2014that\nwhich is inner and, as it were, invisible\u2014takes the form of\nsomething quite separate and distinct. It is also something finite and\nlimited: an idea or meaning entertained by human beings. The\nsensuous element is in turn something separate and distinct from the\nmeaning. It has no intrinsic connection to the meaning, but is, as\nHegel puts it, \u201cexternal\u201d to that meaning. The sensuous\nelement\u2014the pictorial or poetic image\u2014is thus connected\nwith the meaning by nothing but the subjective \u201cwit\u201d or\nimagination of the poet (PK\u00c4, 95). This occurs, Hegel\nmaintains, in fables, parables, allegories, metaphors and similes.\n\n\nThis third sub-division is not associated with any particular\ncivilization, but is a form of expression that is found in many\ndifferent ones. Hegel contends, however, that allegory, metaphor and\nsimile do not constitute the core of truly beautiful art, because they\ndo not present us with the very freedom of spirit itself, but point\nto (and so symbolize) a meaning that is separate and independent.\nA metaphor, such as \u201cAchilles is a lion,\u201d does not embody\nthe spirit of the individual hero in the way that a Greek sculpture\ndoes, but is a metaphor for something that is distinct from\nthe metaphor itself (see Aesthetics, 1: 402\u20138;\nPK\u00c4, 104).\n\n\nHegel\u2019s account of symbolic art (or \u201cpre-art\u201d) draws\nwidely on the work of other writers, such as his former colleague at\nHeidelberg, Georg Friedrich Creuzer, the author of Symbolism and\nMythology of Ancient Peoples, especially the Greeks (1810\u201312).\nHegel\u2019s account is not meant to be strictly historical, but\nrather to place the various forms of pre-art discussed in a\nlogical relation to one another. This relation is determined\nby the degree to which, in each form of pre-art, spirit and nature (or\nthe sensuous) are differentiated from one another.\n\n\nTo recapitulate: in Zoroastrianism, spirit and nature are in immediate\nidentity with one another (as the Light). In Hindu art, there\nis an immediate difference between the spiritual (the divine)\nand nature, but the spiritual remains abstract and indeterminate in\nitself and so can be brought to mind only through images of natural\nthings (unnaturally distorted). In Egyptian art, the spiritual is again\ndifferent from the realm of the merely natural and sensuous.\nIn contrast to the indeterminate divinity of the Hindus, however,\nEgyptian spirituality (in the form of the gods and of the human soul)\nis fixed, separate and determinate in itself. The images of Egyptian\nart thus point symbolically to a realm of spirit that remains\nhidden from direct view. The spirit to which such symbolic images\npoint, however, lacks genuine freedom and life and is often identified\nwith the realm of the dead.\n\n\nIn the sublime poetry of the Jews, God is represented as transcendent\nand as a \u201cfree spiritual subject.\u201d Finite human\nbeings, however, are portrayed in a negative relation to God\nin that they are created to serve and praise God and are pained by\ntheir own sinfulness. In the sublime poetry of \u201coriental\npantheism\u201d God is once again portrayed as transcendent, but, in\ncontrast to Judaism, God and finite things are shown to stand in an\naffirmative relation to one another: things are infused with\nspirit and life by God. The poet\u2019s relation to things is,\naccordingly, one in which his own free spirit finds itself\nreflected in the natural things around him.\n\n\nIn the last stage of pre-art, the difference between the spiritual and\nthe natural (or sensuous) is taken to its limit: the spiritual element\n(the \u201cmeaning\u201d) and the sensuous element (the\n\u201cshape\u201d or \u201cimage\u201d) are now completely\nindependent of, and external to, one another. Furthermore,\neach is finite and limited. This is the realm of allegory and metaphor.\n6.2.2 Classical Art\n\n\nHegel does not deny the magnificence or elegance of pre-art, but he\nmaintains that it falls short of art proper. The latter is found in\nclassical art, or the art of the ancient Greeks.\n\n\nClassical art, Hegel contends, fulfills the concept of art in that it\nis the perfect sensuous expression of the freedom of spirit. It is in\nclassical art, therefore\u2014above all in ancient Greek sculpture\n(and drama)\u2014that true beauty is to be found. Indeed, Hegel\nmaintains, the gods of ancient Greece exhibit \u201cabsolute beauty\nas such\u201d: \u201cthere can be nothing more beautiful than the\nclassical; there is the ideal\u201d (PK\u00c4, 124, 135;\nsee also Aesthetics, 1: 427).\n\n\nSuch beauty consists in the perfect fusion of the spiritual and the\nsensuous (or natural). In true beauty the visible shape before us does\nnot merely intimate the presence of the divine through the unnatural\ndistortion of its form, nor does it point beyond itself to a hidden\nspirituality or to divine transcendence. Rather, the shape manifests\nand embodies free spirituality in its very contours. In true beauty,\ntherefore, the visible shape is not a symbol of, or metaphor for, a\nmeaning that lies beyond the shape, but is the expression of\nspirit\u2019s freedom that brings that freedom directly into view.\nBeauty is sensuous, visible shape so transformed that it stands as the\nvisible embodiment of freedom itself.\n\n\nHegel does not deny that Greek art and mythology contain many symbolic\nelements: the story, for example, that Cronus, the father of Zeus,\nconsumed his own children symbolizes the destructive power of time\n(Aesthetics, 1: 492; PK\u00c4, 120). In\nHegel\u2019s view, however, the distinctive core of Greek art consists\nin works of ideal beauty in which the freedom of spirit is made visible\nfor the first time in history. Three conditions had to be met for such\nbeautiful art to be produced.\n\n\nFirst, the divine had to be understood to be freely self-determining\nspirit, to be divine subjectivity (not just an abstract power\nsuch as the Light). Second, the divine had to be understood to take the\nform of individuals who could be portrayed in sculpture and\ndrama. The divine had to be conceived, in other words, not as sublimely\ntranscendent, but as spirituality that is embodied in many\ndifferent ways. The beauty of Greek art thus presupposed Greek\npolytheism. Third, the proper shape of free spirit had to be recognized\nto be the human body, not that of an animal. Hindu and Egyptian gods\nwere often portrayed as a fusion of human and animal forms; by\ncontrast, the principal Greek gods were depicted in ideal human form.\nHegel notes that Zeus would sometimes take on animal form, for example\nwhen he was engaged in seduction; but he sees Zeus\u2019\ntransformation of himself into a bull for the purpose of seduction as a\nlingering echo of Egyptian mythology in the Greek world (see\nPK\u00c4, 119\u201320, in which Hegel confuses Io, who in another story was\nherself changed into a white cow by Zeus to protect her from the jealous Hera, with Europa,\nwho was the object of Zeus\u2019 love in the story Hegel has in\nmind).\n\n\nNot only do Greek art and beauty presuppose Greek religion and\nmythology, but Greek religion itself requires art in order to\ngive a determinate identity to the gods. As Hegel notes (following\nHerodotus), it was the poets Homer and Hesiod who gave the Greeks their\ngods, and Greek understanding of the gods was developed and expressed\nabove all in their sculpture and drama (rather than in distinctively\ntheological writings) (PK\u00c4, 123\u20134). Greek religion\nthus took the form of what Hegel in the Phenomenology called a\n\u201creligion of art.\u201d Moreover, Greek art achieved the highest\ndegree of beauty, in Hegel\u2019s view, precisely because it\nwas the highest expression of the freedom of spirit enshrined in Greek\nreligion.\n\n\nAlthough Greek sculpture and drama achieved unsurpassed heights of\nbeauty, such art did not give expression to the deepest\nfreedom of the spirit. This is because of a deficiency in the Greek\nconception of divine and human freedom. Greek religion was so well\nsuited to aesthetic expression because the gods were conceived as free\nindividuals who were wholly at one with their bodies and their sensuous\nlife. In other words, they were free spirits still immersed in nature\n(PK\u00c4, 132\u20133). In Hegel\u2019s view, however, a\ndeeper freedom is attained when the spirit withdraws into itself out of\nnature and becomes pure self-knowing interiority. Such an understanding\nof spirit is expressed, according to Hegel, in Christianity. The\nChristian God is thus pure self-knowing spirit and love who created\nhuman beings so that they, too, may become such pure spirit and love.\nWith the emergence of Christianity comes a new form of art:\nromantic art. Hegel uses the term \u201cromantic\u201d to\nrefer not to the art of the late 18th- and early 19th-century German\nRomantics (many of whom he knew personally), but to the whole tradition\nof art that emerged in Western Christendom.\n6.2.3 Romantic Art\n\n\nRomantic art, like classical art, is the sensuous expression or\nmanifestation of the freedom of spirit. It is thus capable of genuine\nbeauty. The freedom it manifests, however, is a profoundly\ninward freedom that finds its highest expression and\narticulation not in art itself but in religious faith and philosophy.\nUnlike classical art, therefore, romantic art gives expression to a\nfreedom of the spirit whose true home lies beyond art. If\nclassical art can be compared to the human body which is thoroughly\nsuffused with spirit and life, romantic art can be compared to the\nhuman face which discloses the spirit and personality within.\nSince romantic art actually discloses the inner spirit,\nhowever, rather than merely pointing to it, it differs from symbolic\nart which it otherwise resembles.\n\n\nRomantic art, for Hegel, takes three basic forms. The first is that of\nexplicitly religious art. It is in Christianity, Hegel\ncontends, that the true nature of spirit is revealed. What is\nrepresented in the story of Christ\u2019s life, death and resurrection\nis the idea that a truly divine life of freedom and love is at\nthe same time a fully human life in which we are willing to\n\u201cdie\u201d to ourselves and let go of what is most precious to\nus. Much religious romantic art, therefore, focuses on the suffering\nand death of Christ.\n\n\nHegel notes that it is not appropriate in romantic art to depict Christ\nwith the idealized body of a Greek god or hero, because what is central\nto Christ is his irreducible humanity and mortality. Romantic art,\ntherefore, breaks with the classical ideal of beauty and incorporates\nreal human frailty, pain and suffering into its images of Christ (and\nalso of religious martyrs). Indeed, such art can even go to the point\nof being \u201cugly\u201d (unsch\u00f6n) in its depiction of\nsuffering (PK\u00c4, 136).\n\n\nIf, however, romantic art is to fulfill the purpose of art and present\ntrue freedom of spirit in the form of beauty, it must show the\nsuffering Christ or suffering martyrs to be imbued with a profound\ninwardness (Innigkeit) of feeling and a genuine sense\nof reconciliation (Vers\u00f6hnung)\n(PK\u00c4, 136\u20137): for such an inward sense of\nreconciliation, in Hegel\u2019s view, is the deepest spiritual\nfreedom. The sensuous expression (in color or words) of this inner\nsense of reconciliation constitutes what Hegel calls the \u201cbeauty\nof inwardness\u201d or \u201cspiritual beauty\u201d (geistige\nSch\u00f6nheit) (PK\u00c4, 137). Strictly speaking,\nsuch spiritual beauty is not as consummately beautiful as\nclassical beauty, in which the spirit and the body are perfectly fused\nwith one another. Spiritual beauty, however, is the product of, and\nreveals, a much more profound inner freedom of spirit than\nclassical beauty and so moves and engages us much more readily than do\nthe relatively cold statues of Greek gods.\n\n\nThe most profound spiritual beauty in the visual arts is found, in\nHegel\u2019s view, in painted images of the Madonna and Child, for in these\nwhat is expressed is the feeling of boundless love.  Hegel\nhad a special affection for the paintings of the Flemish Primitives,\nJan van Eyck and Hans Memling, whose work he saw on his visits to\nGhent and Bruges in 1827 (Hegel: The Letters, 661\u20132),\nbut he also held Raphael in high regard and was particularly moved by\nthe expression of \u201cpious, modest mother-love\u201d in\nRaphael\u2019s Sistine Madonna which he saw in Dresden in 1820\n(PK\u00c4, 39; P\u00f6ggeler et al 1981, 142). Greek\nsculptors portrayed Niobe as simply \u201cpetrified in her\npain\u201d at the loss of her children. By contrast, the painted\nimages of the Virgin Mary are imbued by van Eyck and Raphael with an\n\u201ceternal love\u201d and a \u201csoulfulness\u201d that Greek\nstatues can never match (PK\u00c4, 142, 184).\n\n\nThe second fundamental form of romantic art identified by Hegel depicts\nwhat he calls the secular \u201cvirtues\u201d of the free spirit\n(Aesthetics, 1: 553; PK\u00c4, 135). These are not\nthe ethical virtues displayed by the heroes and heroines of\nGreek tragedy: they do not involve a commitment to the necessary\ninstitutions of freedom, such as the family or the state. Rather, they\nare the formal virtues of the romantic hero: that is to say,\nthey involve a commitment by the free individual, often grounded in contingent choice or passion, to an object or another person.\n\n\nSuch virtues include that of romantic love (which concentrates on a\nparticular, contingent person), loyalty towards an individual (that can\nchange if it is to one\u2019s advantage), and courage (which\nis often displayed in the pursuit of personal ends, such as rescuing a\ndamsel in distress, but can also be displayed in the pursuit of\nquasi-religious ends, such as the hunt for the Holy Grail)\n(PK\u00c4, 143\u20134).\n\n\nSuch virtues are found primarily in the world of mediaeval chivalry\n(and are subjected to ridicule, Hegel points out, in Cervantes\u2019\nDon Quixote) (Aesthetics, 1: 591\u20132;\nPK\u00c4, 150). They can, however, also crop up in more\nmodern works and, indeed, are precisely the virtues displayed in an\nart-form of which Hegel could know nothing, namely the American\nWestern.\n\n\nThe third fundamental form of romantic art depicts the formal freedom\nand independence of character. Such freedom is not associated with any\nethical principles or (at least not principally) with the formal virtues just\nmentioned, but consists simply in the \u201cfirmness\u201d\n(Festigkeit) of character (Aesthetics, 1: 577;\nPK\u00c4, 145\u20136). This is freedom in its modern, secular\nform. It is displayed most magnificently, Hegel believes, by\ncharacters, such as Richard III, Othello and Macbeth, in the plays of\nShakespeare. Note that what interests us about such individuals is not\nany moral purpose (which they invariably lack anyway), but simply the energy and\nself-determination (and often ruthlessness) that they exhibit. Such\ncharacters must have an internal richness (revealed through imagination\nand language) and not just be one-dimensional, but their main appeal is\ntheir formal freedom to commit themselves to a course of action, even\nat the cost of their own lives. These characters do not constitute\nmoral or political ideals, but they are the appropriate objects of\nmodern, romantic art whose task is to depict freedom even in its most\nsecular and amoral forms.\n\n\nHegel also sees romantic beauty in more inwardly sensitive characters,\nsuch as Shakespeare\u2019s Juliet. After meeting Romeo, Hegel remarks,\nJuliet suddenly opens up with love like a rosebud, full of childlike\nnaivety. Her beauty thus lies in being the embodiment of love. Hamlet\nis a somewhat similar character: far from being simply weak (as Goethe\nthought), Hamlet, in Hegel\u2019s view, displays the inner beauty of a\nprofoundly noble soul (Aesthetics, 1: 583; PK\u00c4,\n147\u20138).\n6.2.4 The \u201cEnd\u201d of Art\n\n\nOne should note that the development of romantic art, as Hegel\ndescribes it, involves the increasing secularization and humanization\nof art. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (as in ancient Greece)\nart was closely tied to religion: art\u2019s function was to a large\ndegree to make the divine visible. With the Reformation, however,\nreligion turned inward and found God to be present in faith\nalone, not in the icons and images of art. As a result, Hegel\npoints out, we who live after the Reformation \u201cno longer venerate\nworks of art\u201d (VPK, 6). Furthermore, art itself was\nreleased from its close ties to religion and allowed to become fully\nsecular. \u201cTo Protestantism alone,\u201d Hegel states, \u201cthe\nimportant thing is to get a sure footing in the prose of life, to make\nit absolutely valid in itself independently of religious associations,\nand to let it develop in unrestricted freedom\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 1: 598).\n\n\nIt is for this reason, in Hegel\u2019s view, that art in the modern\nage no longer meets our highest needs and no longer affords us the\nsatisfaction that it gave to earlier cultures and civilizations. Art\nsatisfied our highest needs when it formed an integral part of\nour religious life and revealed to us the nature of the divine\n(and, as in Greece, the true character of our fundamental ethical\nobligations). In the modern, post-Reformation world, however, art has\nbeen released (or has emancipated itself) from subservience to\nreligion. As a result, \u201cart, considered in its highest vocation,\nis and remains for us a thing of the past\u201d (Aesthetics,\n1: 11).\n\n\nThis does not mean that art now has no role to play and that it\nprovides no satisfaction at all. Art is no longer the highest and most\nadequate way of expressing the truth (as it was, according to Hegel, in\nfifth-century Athens); we moderns now seek ultimate or\n\u201cabsolute\u201d truth in religious faith or in philosophy,\nrather than in art. (Indeed, the considerable importance we assign to\nphilosophy is evident, in Hegel\u2019s view, in the prominence of the\nphilosophical study of art itself in modernity [Aesthetics, 1:\n11; VPK, 6].) Yet art in modernity continues to perform the\nsignificant function of giving visible and audible expression to our\ndistinctively human freedom and to our understanding of ourselves in\nall our finite humanity.\n\n\nHegel does not claim, therefore, that art as a whole simply comes to an\nend or \u201cdies\u201d in the modern age. His view is, rather, that\nart plays (or at least should play) a more limited role now\nthan it did in ancient Greece or in the Middle Ages. Yet Hegel does\nthink that art in modernity comes to an end in a certain\nrespect. To understand why he thinks this, we need to consider his\nclaim that art in modernity \u201cfalls apart\u201d\n(zerf\u00e4llt) into the exploration of everyday\ncontingencies, on the one hand, and the celebration of witty,\n\u201chumorous\u201d subjectivity, on the other (PK\u00c4,\n151).\n\n\nIn Hegel\u2019s view, much painting and poetry after the Reformation\nfocuses its attention on the prosaic details of ordinary daily life,\nrather than on the intimacy of religious love or the magnificent\nresolve and energy of tragic heroes. To the extent that such works of\nart no longer aim to give expression to divine or human freedom but\nseek (apparently at least) to do no more than \u201cimitate\nnature,\u201d they prompt Hegel to consider whether they still count\nas \u201cart works\u201d in the strictly philosophical (as opposed to\nthe more generally accepted) sense of the term. In the twentieth\ncentury it is the abstract creations of, for example, Jackson Pollock\nor Carl Andr\u00e9 that usually provoke the question: \u201cis this\nart?\u201d. In Hegel\u2019s mind, however, it is works that appear to\nbe purely naturalistic and \u201crepresentational\u201d that raise\nthis question. His view is that such works count as genuine works of\nart only when they do more than merely imitate nature. The\nnaturalistic and prosaic works that best meet this criterion, he\nmaintains, are the paintings of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century\nDutch masters.\n\n\nIn such works, Hegel claims, the painter does not aim simply to show us\nwhat grapes, flowers or trees look like: we know that already\nfrom nature. The painter aims, rather, to capture the\u2014often\nfleeting\u2014\u201clife\u201d (Lebendigkeit) of things:\n\u201cthe lustre of metal, the shimmer of a bunch of grapes by\ncandlelight, a vanishing glimpse of the moon or the sun, a smile, the\nexpression of a swiftly passing emotion\u201d (Aesthetics, 1:\n599). Often, indeed, the painter seeks to delight us specifically with\nthe animated play of the colors of gold, silver, velvet or fur. In such\nworks, Hegel notes, we encounter not just the depiction of things, but\n\u201cas it were, an objective music, a peal in colour [ein\nT\u00f6nen in Farben]\u201d (Aesthetics, 1:\n598\u2013600).\n\n\n A\ngenuine work of art is the sensuous expression of divine or human\nfreedom and life. Paintings that are no more than prosaic, naturalistic\ndepictions of everyday objects or human activity would thus appear to\nfall short of genuine art. Dutch artists, however, turn such depictions\ninto true works of art precisely by imbuing objects with \u201cthe\nfullness of life.\u201d In so doing, Hegel claims, they give expression\nto their own sense of freedom, \u201ccomfort\u201d and\n\u201ccontentment\u201d and their own exuberant subjective skill\n(Aesthetics, 1: 599; PK\u00c4, 152). The paintings\nof such artists may lack the classical beauty of Greek art, but they\nexhibit magnificently the subtle beauties and delights of everyday\nmodern life. \n\n\nA much more overt expression of subjectivity is found by Hegel in\nworks of modern humor. Such witty, ironic, humorous\nsubjectivity\u2014one we might now describe as\n\u201canarchic\u201d\u2014manifests itself in playing or\n\u201csporting\u201d with objects, \u201cderanging\u201d and\n\u201cperverting\u201d material and \u201crambling to and\nfro,\u201d and in the \u201ccriss-cross movement of subjective\nexpressions, views, and attitudes whereby the author sacrifices\nhimself and his topics alike\u201d (Aesthetics, 1:\n601). Hegel claims that works of \u201ctrue humour,\u201d\nsuch as Laurence Sterne\u2019s\nTristram Shandy (1759), succeed in making \u201cwhat is\nsubstantial emerge out of contingency.\u201d Their \u201ctriviality\n[thus] affords precisely the supreme idea of depth\u201d\n(Aesthetics, 1: 602). In other works, by contrast\u2014such\nas those of Hegel\u2019s contemporary, Jean Paul Richter\u2014all\nwe encounter is the \u201cbaroque mustering of things objectively\nfurthest removed from one another\u201d and \u201cthe most confused\ndisorderly jumbling of topics related only in his own subjective\nimagination\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 601). In such works, we do\nnot see human freedom giving itself objective expression, but rather\nwitness subjectivity \u201cdestroying and dissolving everything that\nproposes to make itself objective and win a firm shape for itself in\nreality\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 601).\n\n\nTo the extent that works of humor do not give body to true\nself-determining freedom and life\u2014or afford \u201cthe supreme\nidea of depth\u201d\u2014but merely manifest the power of\narbitrary, subjective wit to subvert the settled order, such works, in\nHegel\u2019s view, no longer count as genuine works of art.\nConsequently, \u201cwhen the subject lets itself go in this way, art\nthereby comes to an end [so h\u00f6rt damit die Kunst\nauf]\u201d (PK\u00c4, 153). In this respect, Hegel\ndoes after all proclaim that art comes to an end in modernity. This is\nnot because art no longer performs a religious function and so no\nlonger fulfills the highest vocation of art; it is because there emerge\nin modernity certain \u201cart works\u201d that are no longer the\nexpressions of true human freedom and life and so no longer genuine\nart works at all.\n\n\nAs was noted above, however, this does not mean that art as a\nwhole comes to an end in the early nineteenth century. Art, in\nHegel\u2019s view, still has a future: \u201cwe may well hope,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cthat art will always rise higher and come to\nperfection\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 103). For Hegel, the\ndistinctive character of genuine art in contemporary\n(and future) modernity\u2014and thus of genuinely modern art\u2014is\ntwofold. On the one hand, it remains bound to give expression to\nconcrete human life and freedom; on the other hand, it is no longer\nrestricted to any of the three art-forms. That is to say, it does not\nhave to observe the proprieties of classical art or explore the\nintense emotional inwardness or heroic freedom or comfortable\nordinariness that we find in romantic art.  Modern art, for Hegel, can\ndraw on features of any of the art-forms (including symbolic art) in\nits presentation of human life. Indeed, it can also present human life\nand freedom indirectly through the depiction of nature.\n\n\nThe focus of modern art, therefore, does not have to be on one\nparticular conception of human freedom rather than another. The new\n\u201choly of holies\u201d in art is humanity itself\u2014\n\u201cHumanus\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cthe depths and\nheights of the human heart as such, mankind in its joys and sorrows,\nits strivings, deeds, and fates\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 607).\nModern art, in Hegel\u2019s view, thus enjoys an unprecedented freedom to\nexplore \u201cthe infinity of the human heart\u201d in manifold ways\n(V\u00c4, 181). For this reason, there is little that Hegel\ncan say about the path that art should take in the future; that is for\nartists to decide.\n\n\nHegel\u2019s judgment that modern artists are\u2014and are quite\nrightly\u2014free to adopt whatever style they please has surely\nbeen confirmed by the history of art since Hegel\u2019s death in 1831.\nThere is reason to suspect, however, that Hegel might not have welcomed\nmany of the developments in post-Hegelian art. This is due to the fact\nthat, although he does not lay down any rules that are to govern modern\nart, he does identify certain conditions that should be met if modern\nart is to be genuine art. Hegel notes, for example, that such art\nshould \u201cnot contradict the formal law of being simply beautiful\nand capable of artistic treatment\u201d (Aesthetics, 1: 605;\nVPK, 204). He insists that modern artists should draw their\ncontent from their own human spirit and that \u201cnothing that can be\nliving [lebendig] in the human breast is alien to\nthat spirit.\u201d He also remarks that modern art may represent\n\u201ceverything in which the human being as such is capable of being\nat home [heimisch]\u201d (Aesthetics, 1:\n607). These may appear to be fairly innocuous conditions, but they\nsuggest that certain post-Hegelian art works would not count in\nHegel\u2019s eyes as genuine works of art. These might include works\nthat by no stretch of the imagination can be called\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d (such as some of the paintings of Willem De\nKooning or Francis Bacon), or works in which it is evidently hard to\nfeel very much \u201cat home\u201d (such as the writings of Franz\nKafka). Hegel\u2019s account of the different arts (such as sculpture\nand painting) also suggests that he would not have regarded the move\nfrom figurative to abstract visual art as appropriate: Netherlandish\nand Dutch painters excelled in the creating of \u201cobjective\nmusic\u201d through the play of colors, yet they did so not in the\nabstract but in the very depiction of concrete, identifiable objects.\n(Robert Pippin takes a different view on this last point; see Pippin\n2007.)\n\n\nFrom a twentieth- or twenty-first-century point of view, Hegel\u2019s\nstance may well look conservative. From his point of view, however, he\nwas trying to understand what conditions would have to be met for works\nof art to be genuine works of art and genuinely modern. The\nconditions that Hegel identified\u2014namely that art should present\nthe richness of human freedom and life and should allow us to feel at\nhome in its depictions\u2014are ones that many modern artists (for\nexample, Impressionists such as Monet, Sisley and Pissarro) have felt\nno trouble in meeting. For others, these conditions are simply too\nrestrictive. They have thus taken modern art in a direction in which,\nfrom a Hegelian perspective, it has ceased to be art in the\ntrue sense any longer.\n",
