    "main_text": "Law || Law is posited by the responsible authority\n7.3 Law is posited by the responsible authority\n\nThe person or body that \u201chas the care of the community\u201d is\nentitled to make laws. Aquinas treats all human law as\n\u201cposited\u201d and (synonymously) \u201cpositive\u201d, even\nthose of its rules that are restatements of, or authoritatively\npromulgated deductions (conclusiones) from, general moral\nprinciples or norms. Interpretation, too, Aquinas thinks of as\ninvolving, in the last analysis, an appeal to the legislator(s) to\ndeclare what the enacted law truly means.\n\nThe making of law by custom is not incompatible with this thesis; it\namounts to a positing of law by the people, considered as having a\ndiffused authority and responsibility for their own community.\n\nEven in a paradise unflawed by any human vice, there would, Aquinas\nthinks, have been need for government and for law, though not\nnecessarily \u201cpolitical\u201d government, still less coercive\nlaw. For social life needs a considerable amount of common policy and\ncommon action which cannot otherwise than by authoritative\ndeterminatio be achieved by a group whose members have many\nideas \u2013 perhaps all of them good \u2013 about priorities and\nways to proceed: ST I q. 96 a. 4. A determinatio, if\nit is just and fit to be authoritative, must have a rational\nconnection to principles of practical reasonableness. But that\nrational connection is like an architect\u2019s decisions about\ndimensions; they must be rationally connected to the terms of the\ncommission (e.g. to build a maternity hospital, not a lion\u2019s\ncage) but these terms, while excluding various options, leave many\noptions entirely open (the doors must be more than 1 foot high but as\nbetween 7.1 and 7.2 feet the choice is entirely free, and likewise\nwith every dimension, selection of materials, colors, and so\nforth).\n",
