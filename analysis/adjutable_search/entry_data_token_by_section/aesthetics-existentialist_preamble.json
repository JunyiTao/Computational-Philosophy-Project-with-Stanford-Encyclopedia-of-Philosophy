    "main_text": "\n\n\nMany of the philosophers commonly described as\n\u201cexistentialist\u201d have made original and decisive\ncontributions to aesthetic thinking. In most cases, a substantial\ninvolvement in artistic practice (as novelists, playwrights or\nmusicians) nourished their thinking on aesthetic experience. This is\ntrue already of two of the major philosophers who inspired\n20th century existentialism: S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and\nFriedrich Nietzsche. For reasons of space, however, this entry is\nrestricted to 20th century thinkers who at one point or\nanother accepted the tag \u201cexistentialist\u201d as an accurate\ncharacterisation of their thinking, and who have made the most\nsignificant contributions to aesthetics: Albert Camus, Simone de\nBeauvoir, Gabriel Marcel, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean-Paul\nSartre.\n\n\nExistentialism owes its name to its emphasis on\n\u201cexistence\u201d. For all the thinkers mentioned above,\nregardless of their differences, existence indicates the special way in\nwhich human beings are in the world, in contrast with other beings. For\nthe existentialists, the human being is \u201cmore\u201d than what it\nis: not only does the human being know that it is but, on the\nbasis of this fundamental knowledge, this being can choose how\nit will \u201cuse\u201d its own being, and thus how it will relate to\nthe world. \u201cExistence\u201d is thus closely related to freedom\nin the sense of an active engagement in the world. This metaphysical\ntheory regarding human freedom leads into a distinct approach to\nontology, i.e., the study of the different ways of being.\n\n\nThis ontological aspect of existentialism ties it to aesthetic\nconsiderations. Existentialist thinkers believe that, under certain\nconditions, freedom grants the human being the capacity of revealing\nessential features of the world and of the beings in it. Since artistic\npractice is one of the prime examples of free human activity, it is\ntherefore also one of the privileged modes of revealing what the world\nis about. However, since most of the existentialists followed Nietzsche\nin the conviction that \u201cGod is dead,\u201d art\u2019s power of\nrevelation is to a large extent devoted to expressing the absurdity of\nthe human condition. For the existentialists, the world is no longer\nhospitable to our human desire for meaning and order.\n\n\nThis ontological approach to art underpins some of the most\ndistinctive features of existentialist aesthetics. Because it views art\nin terms of \u201crevelation,\u201d it favors representative art and\nis suspicious of formalist avant-gardes. And because it grounds\nexpressive capacity on the notion of human freedom, it demands that\nartistic representation be strongly informed by ethical and political\nconcerns. This is why at times existentialist aesthetics can appear out\nof touch with the aesthetic avant-gardes of the 20th\ncentury.\n\n\nSome of the existentialists wrote substantial analyses about\ndifferent art forms and how they can be compared, elaborating something\nlike a \u201csystem of the arts\u201d similar to that of classical\naesthetics. All the existentialist thinkers, with the exception of\nMerleau-Ponty, thought that the form that best enabled the revelatory\npotential of art was the theatre, followed by the novel.\n",
