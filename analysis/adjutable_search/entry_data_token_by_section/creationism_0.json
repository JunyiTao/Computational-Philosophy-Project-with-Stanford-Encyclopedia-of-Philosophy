    "main_text": "History of Creationism\n1. History of Creationism\n\nCreationists present themselves as the true bearers and present-day\nrepresentatives of authentic, traditional Christianity, but\nhistorically speaking this is simply not true (Ruse 1988 (ed.), 2005;\nNumbers 1992; McMullin 1985). The Bible has a major place in the life\nof any Christian, but it is not the case that the Bible taken\nliterally has always had a major place in the lives or theology of\nChristians. For most, indeed, it has not (Turner 2002). Although, one\nshould remember that most literalists are better known as\ninerrantists, because they often differ on the meaning of a literal\nreading! Tradition, the teachings and authority of the church, has\nalways had main status for Catholics, and natural religion \u2013\napproaching God through reason and argument \u2013 has long had an\nhonored place for both Catholics and Protestants. Catholics,\nespecially dating back to Saint Augustine around 400 AD, and even to\nearlier thinkers like Origen, have always recognized that at times the\nBible needs to be taken metaphorically or allegorically. Augustine was\nparticularly sensitive to this need, because for many years as a young\nman he was a Manichean and hence denied the authenticity and relevance\nof the Old Testament for salvation. When he became a Christian he knew\nfull well the problems of Genesis and hence was eager to help his\nfellow believers from getting ensnared in the traps of literalism.\n\n\nIt was not until the Protestant Reformation that the Bible started to\ntake on its unique central position, as the great Reformers \u2013\nespecially Luther and Calvin \u2013 stressed the need to go by\nscripture alone and not by what they took to be the overly rich\ntraditions of the Catholic Church. But even they were doubtful about\ntotally literalistic readings. For Luther, justification by faith was\nthe keystone of his theology, and yet the Epistle of Saint James seems\nto put greater stress on the need for good works. He referred to the\ngospel as \u2018right strawy stuff.\u2019 (Wengert 2013). Calvin\nlikewise spoke of the need for God to accommodate His writings to the\nuntutored public \u2013 especially the ancient Jews \u2013 and hence\nof the dangers of taking the Bible too literally in an uncritical\nsense. The radical branch of the Reformation under Zwingli always put\nprimacy on God\u2019s speaking directly to us through the heart, and to\nthis day one finds modern-day representatives like the Quakers\nuncomfortable with too-biblically centered an approach to religion.\n\n\nIt was after the religious revivals of the eighteenth and early\nnineteenth century in Britain and America \u2013 revivals that led to\nsuch sects as the Methodists \u2013 that a more full-blooded\nliteralism became a major part of the religious scene. In America\nparticularly literalism took hold, and especially after the Civil War,\nit took root in the evangelical sects \u2013 especially Baptists\n\u2013 of the South (Numbers 1998; Noll 2002). It became part of the\ndefining culture of the South, having (as we shall see below) as much\na role in opposing ideas and influences of the leaders and policy\nmakers of the North as anything rooted in deeply thought-through\ntheology. Note the important qualification, \u2018leaders and policy\nmakers\u2019 of the North. Many \u2013 especially working and\nlower-middle-class people \u2013 living in the large cities of the\nNorth felt deeply threatened by the moves to industrialism, the\nweakening of traditional beliefs, and the large influx of immigrants\nfrom Europe. They provided very fertile material for the literalist\npreachers. (See the extended discussions of these happenings in Ruse\n2013.) Thanks to a number of factors, Creationism started to grow\ndramatically in the early part of the twentieth century. First, there\nwere the first systematic attempts to work out a position that would\ntake account of modern science as well as just a literal reading of\nGenesis. Particularly important in this respect were the Seventh-day\nAdventists, especially the Canadian-born George McCready Price, who\nhad theological reasons for wanting literalism, not the least being\nthe belief that the Seventh Day \u2013 the day of rest \u2013 is\nliterally twenty-four hours in length. Also important for the\nAdventists and for fellow travelers, that is people who think that\nArmageddon is on its way, is the balancing and complementary early\nphenomenon of a world-wide flood. (This, as we shall see, was to\nbecome a major theme in twentieth-century Cold War times.) Second,\nthere was the released energy of evangelicals (referring generically\nto Protestants whose faith was tied to the Bible, taken rather\nliterally) as they succeeded in their attempts to prohibit liquor in\nthe United States. Flushed from one victory, they looked for other\nfields to conquer. Third there was the spread of public education, and\nmore children being exposed to evolutionary ideas, bringing on a\nCreationist reaction. Fourth, there were new evangelical currents\nafloat, especially the tracts the Fundamentals \u2013 a series of\nevangelical publications, conceived in 1909 by California businessman\nLyman Stewart, the founder of Union Oil and a devout Presbyterian \u2013\nthat gave the literalist movement its name. And fifth, there was the\nidentification of evolution \u2013 Darwinism particularly \u2013\nwith the militaristic aspects of Social Darwinism, especially the\nSocial Darwinism supposed embraced by the Germans in the First World\nWar (Larson 1997; Ruse 2018a).\n\nThis battle between evolutionists and \u2018Fundamentalists\u2019\ncame to a head in the mid 1920s in Dayton Tennessee, when a young\nschool teacher John Thomas Scopes was prosecuted for teaching\nevolution in class, in defiance of a state law prohibiting such\nteaching. Prosecuted by three-times presidential candidate William\nJennings Bryan and defended by noted agnostic lawyer Clarence Darrow,\nthe \u2018Scopes Monkey Trial\u2019 caught the attention of the\nworld, especially thanks to the inflammatory reporting of\nBaltimore Sun journalist H. L. Mencken. Matters descended to\nthe farcical when, denied the opportunity to introduce his own science\nwitnesses, Darrow put on the stand the prosecutor Bryan. In the end,\nScopes was found guilty and fined $100. This conviction was overturned\non a technicality on appeal, but there were no more prosecutions, even\nthough the Tennessee law remained on the books for another forty\nyears. In the 1950s, the Scopes trial became the basis of a famous\nplay and then movie, Inherit the Wind. This portrays the Bryan\nfigure as a bigot, wedded to a crude picture of life\u2019s past. In fact,\nBryan in respects was an odd figure to be defending the Tennessee law.\nHe thought that the days of Creation are long periods of time, and he\nhad little sympathy for eschatological speculations about Armageddon\nand so forth. It is quite possible that, humans apart, he accepted\nsome form of evolution. His objections to Darwinism were more social\nthan theological. He hated what he thought were the militaristic\nimplications that many drew from the struggle for existence at the\ncenter of Darwin\u2019s thinking. The First World War, with many justifying\nviolence in the name of evolutionary biology, confirmed his\nsuspicions. (The Pulitzer Prize winning, Summer of the Gods,\nLarson 1997, is definitive on the Scopes trial. It is generally agreed\nthat Inherit the Wind is using history as a vehicle to\nexplore and condemn McCarthy-like attacks on uncomfortably new or\ndissenting-type figures in American society.)\n",
