    "main_text": "Second Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: Ecofeminist Philosophy || Linguistic Perspectives\n3.3 Linguistic Perspectives\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein argues that the language one uses mirrors and\nreflects one's view of oneself and the world\u2014one's conceptual\nframework. According to ecofeminist philosophers, language plays a key\nrole in the formation of problematic concepts of women, animals, and\nnature\u2014concepts that reinforce the five features of an\noppressive conceptual framework and contribute to the\n\u201cjustification\u201d of the dominations of women, animals, and\nnature. Consider some examples of how language does this.\nThe English language animalizes and naturalizes\nwomen in cultural contexts where women and nonhuman animals are\nalready viewed as inferior to men and male-identified culture. Women\nare referred to pejoratively as dogs, cats, catty, pussycats, pussies,\npets, bunnies, dumb bunnies, cows, sows, foxes, chicks, bitches,\nbeavers, old bats, old hens, old crows, queen bees, cheetahs, vixen,\nserpents, bird-brains, hare-brains, elephants, and whales. Women\ncackle, go to hen parties, henpeck their husbands, become old biddies\n(old hens no longer sexually attractive or able to reproduce), and\nsocial butterflies. Animalizing women in a sexist (or, patriarchal)\nculture that views animals as inferior to \u201chumans\u201d\nreinforces and attempts to legitimate women's alleged inferior\nstatus to men (see Adams 1990; Joan Dunayer 1995; Warren 2000).\nSimilarly, the English language feminizes nature in cultural\ncontexts that view women and nature as inferior to men and\nmale-identified culture. Mother Nature (not Father Nature) is raped,\nmastered, controlled, conquered, mined; her (not his) secrets are\npenetrated, and her womb (men don't have one) is put into the service\nof the man of science (not woman of science, or simply\nscientist). Virgin timber is felled, cut down. Fertile (not potent)\nsoil is tilled, and land that lies fallow is useless or barren, like a\nwoman unable to conceive a child.\nIn these examples, the exploitations of nature and animals are\njustified by feminizing (not masculinizing) them; the\nexploitation of women is justified by animalizing (not\nhumanizing) and naturalizing (not \u201cculturizing\u201d)\nwomen. As Carol Adams argues (1990), language that feminizes nature\nand naturalizes women describes, reflects, and perpetuates unjustified\npatriarchal domination by failing to see the extent to which the\ndominations of women, nonhuman animals, and nature are culturally (not\njust metaphorically) analogous and sanctioned.\nThe point of these examples is not to claim that only females are\ndenigrated by use of animal or nature language. That would be\nfalse. In the English language, animal terms also are used\npejoratively against men. For example, men are called wolves, sharks,\nskunks, snakes, toads, jackasses, old buzzards, and goats. Nor is it\nto claim that all uses of animal or nature language are\nderogatory. That would also be false. In Western culture, it is\ngenerally complimentary to describe someone as busy as a bee,\neagle-eyed, lion-hearted, or brave as a lion. Rather, the point is\nthat, within patriarchal contexts, the majority of animal and\nnature terms used to describe women, and the majority of female terms\nused to describe animals and nature, function differently from the\nanimal and nature terms used to describe men.  Within a\npatriarchal context, they function to devalue women, animals, and\nnature in a way that reinforces the unjustified dominations of all three.\n\n",
