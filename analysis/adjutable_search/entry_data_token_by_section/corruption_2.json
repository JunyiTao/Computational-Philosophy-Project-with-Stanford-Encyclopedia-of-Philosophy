    "main_text": "Institutional Corruption || Causal Theory of Institutional Corruption\n2.2 Causal Theory of Institutional Corruption\n\nThe causal theory of institutional corruption (Miller 2017)\npresupposes a normative teleological conception of institutions\naccording to which institutions are defined not only as organizations\nor systems of organizations with a purpose(s), but organizations or\nsystems of organizations the purpose(s) of which is a human good. The\ngoods in question are either intrinsic or instrumental goods. For\ninstance, universities are held to have as their purpose the discovery\nand transmission of knowledge, where knowledge is at the very least an\ninstrumental good. (For criticisms see Thompson 2018 and Ceva &\nFerretti 2021.)\n\nIf a serviceable definition of the concept of a corrupt action is to\nbe found\u2014and specifically, one that does not collapse into the\nmore general notion of an immoral action\u2014then attention needs to\nbe focused on the moral effects that some actions have on\npersons and institutions. An action is corrupt only if it corrupts\nsomething or someone\u2014so corruption is not only a moral concept,\nbut also a causal or quasi-causal concept. That is, an action\nis corrupt by virtue of having a corrupting effect on a\nperson\u2019s moral character or on an institutional process or\npurpose. If an action has a corrupting effect on an institution,\nundermining institutional processes or purposes, then\ntypically\u2014but not necessarily\u2014it has a corrupting effect\nalso on persons qua role occupants in the affected\ninstitutions.\n\nAccordingly, an action is corrupt only if it has the effect of\nundermining an institutional process or of subverting an institutional\npurpose or of despoiling the character of some role occupant\nqua role occupant. In light of the possibility that some acts\nof corruption have negligible effects, such as a small one-off bribe\npaid for a minor service, this defining feature needs to be qualified\nso as to include acts that are of a type or kind that tends to\nundermine institutional processes, purposes or persons (qua\ninstitutional role occupants)\u2014as well as individual or token\nacts that actually have the untoward effects in question. Thus\nqualified, the causal character of corruption provides the\nsecond main feature of the causal theory of institutional corruption,\nthe first feature being the normative teleological conception of\ninstitutions. I note accounts predicated on these two assumptions have\nancient origins, notably in Aristotle (Hindess 2001).\n\nIn keeping with the causal account, an infringement of a specific law\nor institutional rule does not in and of itself constitute an act of\ninstitutional corruption. In order to do so, any such infringement\nneeds to have an institutionally undermining effect, or be of\na kind that has a tendency to cause such an effect, e.g., to defeat\nthe institutional purpose of the rule, to subvert the institutional\nprocess governed by the rule, or to contribute to the despoiling of\nthe moral character of a role occupant qua role occupant. In\nshort, we need to distinguish between the offence considered in itself\nand the institutional effect of committing that offence. Considered in\nitself the offence of, say, lying is an infringement of a law, rule,\nand/or a moral principle. However, the offence is only an act of\ninstitutional corruption if it has some institutionally undermining\neffect, or is of a kind that has such a tendency, e.g., it is\nperformed in a courtroom setting and thereby subverts the judicial\nprocess.\n\nA third feature of the causal theory of institutional corruption\npertains to the agents who cause the corruption. As noted in\n section 2.1.3,\n there are many different kinds of entities which might causally\nundermine institutions, including other collective entities. However,\nit is an assumption of the causal theory of corruption that only human\nagents are possessed of minds and moral agency. Accordingly, on the\ncausal theory it is only human agents who culpably perform actions\nthat undermine legitimate institutional processes or purposes.\n\nA fourth and final feature of the causal theory also pertains to the\nagents who cause corruption. It is a further assumption of the causal\ntheory that the human agents who perform acts of corruption (the\ncorruptors) and/or the human agents who are corrupted (the corrupted)\nare necessarily institutional actors (see discussion above in\n section 2.1.3).\n More precisely, acts of institutional corruption necessarily involve\na corruptor who performs the corrupt action qua occupant of an\ninstitutional role and/or someone who is corrupted qua\noccupant of an institutional role.\n\nIn light of the above discussion the following normative theory of\ncorruption suggests itself: the causal theory of institutional\ncorruption (Miller 2017: Chapter 3).\n\nAn act x (whether a single or joint action) performed by an\nagent (or set of agents) A is an act of institutional\ncorruption if and only if:\n\nx has an effect, or is an instance of a kind of act that\nhas a tendency to have an effect, of undermining, or contributing to\nthe undermining of, some institutional process and/or purpose\n(understood as a collective good) of some institution, I,\nand/or an effect of contributing to the despoiling of the moral\ncharacter of some role occupant of I, agent (or set of\nagents) B, qua role occupant of I;\nAt least one of (a) or (b) is true:\n\n\nA is a role occupant of I who used the\nopportunities afforded by their role to perform x, and in so\ndoing A intended or foresaw the untoward effects in question,\nor should have foreseen them;\nB could have avoided the untoward effects, if\nB had chosen to do\n so.[5]\n \n\n\nNote that\n (2) (a)\n tells us that A is a corruptor and is, therefore, either\n(straightforwardly) morally responsible for the corrupt action, or\nA is not morally responsible for A\u2019s corrupt\ncharacter and the corrupt action is an expression of\nA\u2019s corrupt character.\n\nNotice also that the causal theory being cast in general terms, i.e.,\nthe undermining of institutional purposes, processes and/or persons\n(qua institutional role occupants), can accommodate a\ndiversity of corruption in a wide range of institutions in different\nsocial, political and economic settings, past and present, and\naccommodate also a wide range of mechanisms or structures of\ncorruption, including structural relations of dependency, collective\naction problems and so on.\n\nA controversial feature of the causal account is that organizations\nthat are entirely morally and legally illegitimate, such as criminal\norganizations, (e.g., the mafia), are not able to be corrupted (Lessig\n2013b). For on the causal account the condition of corruption exists\nonly relative to an uncorrupted condition, which is the condition of\nbeing a morally legitimate institution or sub-element thereof.\nConsider the uncorrupted judicial process. It consists of the\npresentation of objective evidence that has been gathered lawfully, of\ntestimony in court being presented truthfully, of the rights of the\naccused being respected, and so on. This otherwise morally legitimate\njudicial process may be corrupted, if one or more of its constitutive\nactions are not performed in accordance with the process as it ought\nto be. Thus to present fabricated evidence, to lie under oath, and so\non, are all corrupt actions. In relation to moral character, consider\nan honest accountant who begins to \u201cdoctor the books\u201d\nunder the twin pressures of a corrupt senior management and a desire\nto maintain a lifestyle that is only possible if he is funded by the\nvery high salary he receives for doctoring the books. By engaging in\nsuch a practice he risks the erosion of his moral character; he is\nundermining his disposition to act honestly.\n",
