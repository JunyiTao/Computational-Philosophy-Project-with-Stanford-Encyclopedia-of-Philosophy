    "main_text": "The Idea of Necessary Connection || Necessary Connection: Critical Phase\n6.1 Necessary Connection: Critical Phase\n\nTo get clear about the idea of power or necessary connection, we need\nto determine the impressions that are its source. Hume identifies\nthree possible sources in the work of his predecessors: Locke thought\nwe get our idea of power secondarily from external\nimpressions of the interactions of physical objects, and\nprimarily from internal impressions of our ability to move\nour bodies and to consider ideas. Malebranche argued that what we take\nto be causes of the motion of bodies or mental activity aren\u2019t\ncauses at all. They are only occasions for God, the sole\nsource of necessary connection, to act in the world. Hume rejects all\nthree possibilities.\n\nHe argues that external impressions of the interactions of\nbodies can\u2019t give rise to our idea of power. When we see that\nthe motion of one billiard ball follows another, we\u2019re only\nobserving their conjunction, never their\nconnection.\n\nAttending to internal impressions of the operations of our\nminds doesn\u2019t help. Although voluntary bodily movements follow\nour willing that those movements occur, this is a matter of fact I\nlearn through experience, not from some internal impression of my\nwill\u2019s power. When I decide to type, my fingers move over the\nkeyboard. When I decide to stop, they stop, but I have no idea how\nthis happens. Were I aware of the power of my will to move my fingers,\nI\u2019d know both how it worked and its limits.\n\nOur ability to control our thoughts doesn\u2019t give us an\nimpression of power, either. We don\u2019t have a clue about how we\ncall up our ideas. Our command over them is limited and varies from\ntime to time. We learn about these limitations and variations only\nthrough experience, but the mechanisms by which they operate are\nunknown and incomprehensible to us. If I decide to think about\nIstanbul, my idea of that city comes to mind, but I experience only\nthe succession of my decision followed by the idea\u2019s appearance,\nnever the power itself.\n\nWhen ordinary people can\u2019t determine an event\u2019s cause,\nthey attribute it to some \u201cinvisible intelligent\nprinciple\u201d. Malebranche and other occasionalists do the same,\nexcept they apply it across the board. True causes aren\u2019t powers\nin the physical world or in human minds. The only true cause is\nGod\u2019s willing that certain objects should always be conjoined\nwith certain others.\n\nAnyone aware of our minds\u2019 narrow limits should realize that\nMalebranche\u2019s theory takes us into\n\u201cfairyland\u201d\u2014it goes so far beyond our experience\nthat we have no way of intelligibly assessing it. It also capitalizes\non how little we know about the interactions of bodies, but since our\nidea of God is based on extrapolations from our faculties, our\nignorance should also apply to him.\n",
