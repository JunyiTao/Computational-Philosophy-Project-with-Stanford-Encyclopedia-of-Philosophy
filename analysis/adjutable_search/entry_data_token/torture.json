The first part concerns the definition of\ntorture and addresses the question, what is torture? The second part\nconcerns the defining features of torture from a moral standpoint and\naddresses the question, what makes torture inherently morally wrong?\nFor instance, it is generally held that torture is defined in part as\nthe deliberate infliction of extreme suffering and that \u2013 by virtue of\nthis defining feature \u2013 torture is morally wrong. Note that even\nactions or practices that are inherently morally wrong might be\nmorally justified in extreme circumstances. Or to put things another\nway, performing an evil action might be morally justified if\nrefraining from performing it constituted a much greater evil. Indeed,\nthe third part of the entry concerns just this possibility: the\npossibility that notwithstanding its inherent moral wrongness, torture\nmight, nevertheless, in extreme emergencies be morally justified. In\nshort, the third part addresses the question, is torture morally\njustified in extreme emergencies? The last part of the entry concerns\nthe legality, as opposed to the morality, of torture and addresses the\nquestion,should torture ever be legalised or otherwise\n institutionalised?[1]\n\nIn relation to the definition of torture, there are now a number of\ncontemporary philosophical accounts on offer, notably those of Twining\n& Paskins (1978), Davis (2005), Miller (2005), Sussman (2005),\nGross (2009) and Kamm (2011). Moreover, there are numerous detailed\ndiscussions concerning the inherent moral wrongness of torture, all of\nwhich focus on the extreme suffering inflicted (Bentham 1804; Shue\n1978; Miller 2005 and 2009; Matthews 2008; Brecher 2008; Kershnar\n2011), but some of which put greater emphasis on torture as a\nviolation of autonomy (Sussman 2005; Miller 2005). Useful collections\nof essays on this and related topics are Levinson 2004, Greenberg et\nal. 2005, Roth & Worden 2005, Rodin 2007, Allhoff 2008, Clucas et\nal. 2009, Luban 2014 and Shue 2016.\n\nThe contemporary debate concerning the moral justifiability of torture\nin extreme emergencies principally concerns the torture of terrorists\nand is dominated by two groups. There are those who argue in the\naffirmative and point to so-called ticking bomb scenarios to support\ntheir case. These theorists often adhere to some form of\nconsequentialism, such as utilitarianism. They include Allhoff (2003,\n2012), and Bagaric and Clarke (2007), albeit the classic utilitarian\njustification remains that of Bentham (1804). (See also Twining &\nTwining 1973.) Then there are those who argue in the negative and\nstress not only the inherent immorality of torture but also contest\nthat it ever has good effects in practice (Davis 2005; Brecher 2008;\nMatthews 2008). For instance, they typically claim that torture does\nnot work, since those who are tortured tell their torturers whatever\nthey want to hear.\n\nThe classic denunciation of the legalisation of torture is that of\nCesare Beccaria 1764. In the contemporary debate concerning the\nlegalisation of torture many theorists of a liberal persuasion have\nstressed the incompatibility of torture with the values underpinning\nliberal institutions (Luban 2005; Waldron 2005, 2010; Shue\n2016). Moreover, in this contemporary debate, the protagonists have\ntended to assume that if torture is morally justified in some extreme\nemergencies then it ought to be legalised. Thus Alan Dershowitz claims\nthat torture is morally justified in some extreme emergencies and, in\nthe light of this claim, argues for torture warrants in these cases\n(2003, \n Chapter 4).[2] \n See also Steinhoff 2006 and\n2013. However, some theorists have argued that although torture can\nin some extreme emergencies be morally justified, nevertheless,\ntorture ought never to be legalised or otherwise\ninstitutionalised. This position was originally advanced by Machan\n(1990) before being argued in more detail by Miller (2005) and (2009),\nand later by McMahan (2008). \n\nBefore proceeding to the question, or questions, of the moral\njustifiability of torture in extreme emergencies we need some\nunderstanding of what torture is. We also need some account of what is\ninherently morally wrong with torture.\n", "toc": [{"#DefiTort": "1. Definition of Torture"}, {"#WhatInheWronTort": "2.

Definition of Torture\n\nTorture includes such practices as searing with hot irons, burning at\nthe stake, electric shock treatment to the genitals, cutting out parts\nof the body, e.g., tongue, entrails or genitals, severe beatings,\nsuspending by the legs with arms tied behind back, applying\nthumbscrews, inserting a needle under the fingernails, drilling\nthrough an unanesthetized tooth, making a person crouch for hours in\nthe \u2018Z\u2019 position, waterboarding (submersion in water or\ndousing to produce the sensation of drowning), and denying food, water\nor sleep for days or weeks on\n end.[3]\n There is a dispute in relation to how extreme the infliction of\nphysical suffering needs to be before it counts as torture and,\ndoubtless, there is a continuum here. For an attempt to make some\ndistinctions in this area see Lauritzen 2013. (For detailed\ndescriptions in a variety of recent and not so recent settings\nincluding in policing and in prisons, see Wickersham 1931, Murton\n& Hyams 1969, Nagel 1978, Landau 1987, Bybee 2002, Public\nCommission Against Torture in Israel (2003), Levinson 2004,\nGreenberg & Dratel 2005, Gross 2009, Clucas et al. 2009,\nFeitlowitz 2011 and Rejali 2007.)\n\n\nAll of these practices presuppose that the torturer has control over\nthe victim\u2019s body, e.g., the victim is strapped to a chair.\n\nMost of these practices, but not all of them, involve the infliction\nof extreme physical pain. For example, sleep deprivation does not\nnecessarily involve the infliction of extreme physical pain.\nHowever, all of these practices involve the infliction of extreme\nphysical suffering, e.g., exhaustion in the case of sleep\ndeprivation. Indeed, all of them involve the intentional\ninfliction of extreme physical suffering on some\nnon-consenting and defenceless person. If A\naccidentally sears B with hot irons A has\nnot tortured B; intention is a necessary condition for\ntorture. Further, if A intentionally sears B with\nhot irons and B consented to this action, then B has\nnot been tortured. Indeed, even if B did not consent, but\nB could have physically prevented A from searing him\nthen B has not been tortured. That is, in order for it to be\nan instance of torture, B has to be\n defenceless.[4]\n\nIs the intentional infliction of extreme mental suffering on\na non-consenting, defenceless person necessarily torture? Michael\nDavis thinks not (2005: 163). Assume that B\u2019s friend,\nA, is being tortured, e.g., A is undergoing electric\nshock treatment, but that B himself is untouched \u2013 albeit\nB is imprisoned in the room adjoining the torture chamber.\n(Alternatively, assume that B is in a hotel room in another\ncountry and live sounds and images of the torture are intentionally\ntransmitted to him in his room by the torturer in such a way that he\ncannot avoid seeing and hearing them other than by leaving the room\nafter having already seen and heard them.) However, A is\nbeing tortured for the purpose of causing B to disclose\ncertain information to the torturer. B is certainly\nundergoing extreme mental suffering. Nevertheless, B is\nsurely not himself being tortured. To see this, reflect on the\nfollowing revised version of the scenario. Assume that A is\nnot in fact being tortured; rather the \u2018torturer\u2019 is only\npretending to torture A. However, B believes that\nA is being tortured; so B\u2019s mental suffering\nis as in the original scenario. In this revised version of the\nscenario the \u2018torturer\u2019 is not torturing A. In\nthat case surely he is not torturing B\n either.[5]\n\nOn the other hand, it might be argued that some instances of\nthe intentional infliction of extreme mental suffering on\nnon-consenting, defenceless persons are cases of torture, albeit some\ninstances (such as the above one) are not. Consider, for example, a\nmock execution or a situation in which a victim with an extreme rat\nphobia lies naked on the ground with his arms and legs tied to stakes\nwhile dozens of rats are placed all over his body and face. The\ndifference between the mock execution and the phobia scenario on the\none hand, and the above case of the person being made to believe that\nhis friend is being tortured on the other hand, is that in the latter\ncase the mental suffering is at one remove; it is suffering caused by\nsomeone else\u2019s (believed) suffering. However, such suffering at\none remove is in general less palpable, and more able to be resisted\nand subjected to rational control; after all, it is not my\nbody that is being electrocuted, my life that is being\nthreatened, or my uncontrollable extreme fear of rats that is\nbeing experienced. An exception to this general rule might be cases\ninvolving the torture of persons with whom the sufferer at one remove\nhas an extremely close relationship and a very strong felt duty of\ncare, e.g. a child and its parent. At any rate, if as appears to be\nthe case, there are some cases of mental torture then the above\ndefinition will need to be extended, albeit in a manner that does not\nadmit all cases of the infliction of extreme mental suffering\nas being instances of torture.\n\nIn various national and international laws, e.g., Convention against\nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment\n(United Nations 1984 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources), a\ndistinction is made between torture and inhumane treatment, albeit\ntorture is a species of inhumane treatment. Such a distinction needs\nto be made. For one thing, some treatment, e.g., flogging, might be\ninhumane without being sufficiently extreme to count as torture. For\nanother thing, some inhumane treatment does not involve physical\nsuffering to any great extent, and is therefore not torture, properly\nspeaking (albeit, the treatment in question may be as morally bad as,\nor even morally worse than, torture). Some forms of the infliction of\nmental suffering are a case in point, as are some forms of morally\ndegrading treatment, e.g., causing a prisoner to pretend to have sex\nwith an animal.\n\nSo torture is the intentional infliction of extreme physical suffering\non some non-consenting, defenceless person. Is this an adequate\ndefinition of torture? Perhaps not, albeit some theorists, such as\nKamm (2011), adhere to this kind of conception. Consider the following\nimaginary counter-example. A woman who is being raped but who is,\nnevertheless, still in control of the movement of her jaws sinks her\nteeth into the face of her attacker causing him excruciating pain\nagainst which he is defenceless, until finally he desists. Surely the\nwoman is not torturing her attacker but rather defending herself by\ninflicting excruciating pain on her attacker. Evidently what is\nmissing in the account thus far is the relationship between torture\nand autonomy: torture substantially curtails autonomy\n\nSo torture is: (a) the intentional infliction of extreme physical\nsuffering on some non-consenting, defenceless person, and; (b) the\nintentional, substantial curtailment of the exercise of the\nperson\u2019s autonomy (achieved by means of (a)). Is this now an\nadequate definition of torture? Perhaps not.\n\nHere we need to consider the purpose or point of torture.\n\nThe above-mentioned U.N. Convention identifies four reasons for\ntorture, namely: (1) to obtain a confession; (2) to obtain\ninformation; (3) to punish; (4) to coerce the sufferer or others to\nact in certain ways. Certainly, these are all possible purposes of\ntorture, as is torture performed for sadistic\n pleasure.[6]\n However, in the contemporary the concern is principally with\ninterrogational torture; torture to obtain information (Skerker\n2010; Lauritzen 2013).\n\n\nIt seems that in general torture is undertaken for the\npurpose of breaking the victim\u2019s\n will.[7]\n If true, this distinguishes torture for the sake of breaking the\nvictim\u2019s will from the other four purposes mentioned above. For\nwith respect to each one of these four purposes, it is not the case\nthat in general torture is undertaken for that purpose, e.g.,\nin most contemporary societies torture is not generally undertaken for\nthe purpose of punishing the victim.\n\nOne consideration in favour of the proposition that breaking the\nvictim\u2019s will is a purpose central to the practice of torture is\nthat achieving the purpose of breaking the victim\u2019s will is very\noften a necessary condition for the achievement of the other four\nidentified purposes (and, indeed, for the achievement of sadistic\npleasure). In the case of interrogatory torture of an enemy spy, for\nexample, in order to obtain the desired information the torturer must\nfirst break the will of the victim. And when torture \u2013 as opposed\nto, for example, flogging as a form of corporal punishment \u2013 is\nused as a form of punishment it typically has as a proximate, and in\npart constitutive, purpose to break the victim\u2019s will. Hence\ntorture as punishment does not consist \u2013 as do other forms of\npunishment \u2013 of a determinate set of specific, pre-determined and\npublicly known acts administered over a definite and limited time\nperiod.\n\nA second consideration is as follows. We have seen that torture\ninvolves substantially curtailing the victim\u2019s autonomy.\nHowever, to substantially curtail someone\u2019s autonomy is not\nnecessarily to break their will. Consider the torture victim who holds\nout and refuses to confess or provide the information sought by the\ntorturer. Nevertheless, a proximate logical endpoint of the process of\ncurtailing the exercise of a person\u2019s autonomy is the breaking\nof their will, at least for a time and in relation to certain\nmatters.\n\nThese two considerations taken together render it plausible that in\ngeneral torture has as a purpose to break the victim\u2019s will.\n\nSo perhaps the following definition is adequate. Torture is: (a) the\nintentional infliction of extreme physical suffering on some\nnon-consenting, defenceless person; (b) the intentional, substantial\ncurtailment of the exercise of the person\u2019s autonomy (achieved\nby means of (a)); (c) in general, undertaken for the purpose\nof breaking the victim\u2019s will.\n\nNote that breaking a person\u2019s will is short of entirely\ndestroying or subsuming their autonomy. Sussman implausibly holds the\nlatter to be definitive of torture: \u201cThe victim of torture finds\nwithin herself a surrogate of the torturer, a surrogate who does not\nmerely advance a particular demand for information, denunciation or\nconfession. Rather, the victim\u2019s whole perspective is given over\nto that surrogate, to the extent that the only thing that matters to\nher is pleasing this other person who appears infinitely distant,\nimportant, inscrutable, powerful and free. The will of the torturer is\nthus cast as something like the source of all value in his\nvictim\u2019s world\u201d (Sussman 2005: 26). (See also Bernstein\n2015.) Such self-abnegation might be the purpose of some forms of\ntorture, as indeed it is of some forms of slavery and brainwashing,\nbut it is certainly not definitive of torture.\n\nConsider victims of torture who are able to resist so that their wills\nare not broken. An example from the history of Australian policing is\nthat of the notorious criminal and hard-man, James Finch: \u201cHe\n[Finch] was handcuffed to a chair and we knocked the shit out of him.\nSiddy Atkinson was pretty fit then and gave him a terrible\nhiding\u2026.no matter what we did to Finch, the bastard\nwouldn\u2019t talk\u201d (Stannard 1988: 40). Again, consider the\nfamous case of Steve Biko who it seems was prepared to die rather than\nallow his torturers to break his will (Arnold 1984:\n 281\u20132).[8]\n\nHere breaking a person\u2019s will can be understood in a minimalist\nor a maximalist sense. This is not to say that the boundaries between\nthese two senses can be sharply drawn.\n\nUnderstood in its minimal sense, breaking a person\u2019s will is\ncausing that person to abandon autonomous decision-making in relation\nto some narrowly circumscribed area of life and for a limited\n period.[9]\n Consider, for example, a thief deciding to disclose or not disclose\nto the police torturing him where he has hidden the goods he has\nstolen (a torturing practice frequently used by police in\n India).[10]\n Suppose further that he knows that he can only be legally held in\ncustody for a twenty-four hour period, and that the police are not\nable to infringe this particular law. By torturing the thief the\npolice might break his will and, against his will, cause him to\ndisclose the whereabouts of the stolen goods.\n\nUnderstood in its maximal sense, breaking a person\u2019s will\ninvolves reaching the endpoint of the kind of process Sussman\ndescribes above, i.e., the point at which the victim\u2019s will is\nsubsumed by the will of the torturer. Winston Smith in George\nOrwell\u2019s 1984 is, as Sussman notes, an instance of the\nlatter extreme endpoint of some processes of torture. Smith ends up\nwillingly betraying what is dearest and most important to him, i.e.,\nhis loved one Julia.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous examples of long term damage to\nindividual autonomy and identity caused by torture, to some extent\nirrespective of whether the victim\u2019s will was broken. For\nexample, some victims of prolonged torture in prisons in authoritarian\nstates are so psychologically damaged that even when released they are\nunable to function as normal adult persons, i.e. as rational choosers\npursuing their projects in a variety of standard interpersonal\ncontexts such as work and family.\n\nGiven the above definition of torture (elaborated in Miller 2005 and\n2009), we can distinguish torture from the following practices.\n\nFirstly, we need to distinguish torture from coercion. In the case of\ncoercion, people are coerced into doing what they don\u2019t want to\ndo. This is consistent with their retaining control over their actions\nand making a rational decision to, say, hand over their wallet when\ntold to do so by a robber who threatens to shoot them dead (albeit\npainlessly) if they don\u2019t do so. As this example shows, coercion\ndoes not necessarily involve the infliction of physical suffering (or\nthreat thereof). So coercion does not necessarily involve torture. Nor\ndoes coercion, which does involve the infliction of physical suffering\nas a means, necessarily constitute torture. Consider, for example, a\nSouth African police officer in the days of apartheid who used a\ncattle prodder which delivers an electric shock on contact as a means\nof controlling an unruly crowd of South African blacks. Presumably,\nthis is not torture because the members of the crowd are not under the\npolice officer\u2019s control; specifically, they are not defenceless\nin the face of the cattle prodder. On the other hand, if \u2013 as also\nevidently took place in apartheid South Africa \u2013 a person was tied\nto a chair and thereby rendered defenceless, and then subjected to\nrepeated electric shocks from a cattle prodder this would constitute\ntorture.\n\nDoes torture necessarily involve coercion? No doubt the threat of\ntorture, and torture in its preliminary stages, simply functions as a\nform of coercion in this sense. However, torture proper has as its\nstarting point the failure of coercion, or that coercion is not even\ngoing to be attempted. As we have seen, torture proper targets\nautonomy itself, and seeks to overwhelm the capacity of the victims to\nexercise rational control over their decisions \u2013 at least in\nrelation to certain matters for a limited period of time \u2013 by\nliterally terrorising them into submission. Hence there is a close\naffinity between terrorism and torture. Indeed, arguably torture is a\nterrorist tactic. However, it is one that can be used by groups other\nthan terrorists, e.g., it can be used against enemy combatants by\narmies fighting conventional wars and deploying conventional military\nstrategies. In relation to the claim that torture is not coercion, it\nmight be responded that at least some forms or instances of torture\ninvolve coercion, namely those in which the torturer is seeking\nsomething from the victim, e.g., information, and in which some degree\nof rational control to comply or not with the torturer\u2019s wishes\nis retained by the victim. This response is plausible. However, even\nif the response is accepted, there will remain instances of torture in\nwhich these above-mentioned conditions do not obtain; presumably,\nthese will not be instances of coercion.\n\nSecondly, torture needs to be distinguished from excruciatingly\npainful medical procedures. Consider the case of a rock-climber who\namputates a fellow climber\u2019s arm, which got caught in a crevice\nin an isolated and inhospitable mountain area. These kinds of case\ndiffer from torture in a number of respects. For example, such medical\nprocedures are consensual and not undertaken to break some\npersons\u2019 will, but rather to promote their physical wellbeing or\neven to save their life.\n\nThirdly, there is corporal punishment. Corporal punishment is, or\nought to be, administered only to persons who have committed some\nlegal and/or moral offence for the purpose of punishing them. By\ncontrast, torture is not \u2013 as is corporal punishment \u2013 limited\nby normative definition to the guilty; and in general torture, but not\ncorporal punishment, has as its purpose the breaking of a\nperson\u2019s will. Moreover, unlike torture, corporal punishment\nwill normally consist of a determinate set of specific, pre-determined\nand publicly known acts administered during a definite and limited\ntime period, e.g., ten lashes of the cat-o-nine-tails for theft.\n\nFourthly, there are ordeals involving the infliction of severe pain.\nConsider Gordon Liddy who reportedly held his hand over a burning\ncandle till his flesh burnt in order to test his will. Ordeals have as\ntheir primary purpose to test a person\u2019s will, but are not\nundertaken to break a person\u2019s will. Moreover, ordeals \u2013 as\nthe Liddy example illustrates \u2013 can be voluntary, unlike\ntorture.\n\nHaving provided ourselves with an analytic account of torture and\ndistinguished torture from some closely related practices, we need to\nturn now to the question, What is Wrong with Torture?\n2. What is Inherently Wrong with Torture?\n\nIn terms of the above definition of torture there are at least two\nthings that are inherently morally wrong with torture. Firstly,\ntorture consists in part in the intentional infliction of severe\nphysical suffering \u2013 typically, severe pain; that is, torture\nhurts very badly. For this reason alone, torture is an evil thing.\n\nSecondly, torture of human beings consists in part in the intentional,\nsubstantial curtailment of individual autonomy. Given the moral\nimportance of autonomy, torture is an evil thing \u2013 even considered\nindependently of the physical suffering it involves. (And if torture\ninvolves the breaking of someone\u2019s will, especially in the\nmaximalist sense, then it is an even greater evil than otherwise would\nbe the case.)\n\nGiven that torture involves both the infliction of extreme physical\nsuffering and the substantial curtailment of the victim\u2019s\nautonomy, torture is a very great evil indeed. Nevertheless, there is\nsome dispute about how great an evil torture is relative to other\ngreat evils, specifically killing and murder.\n\nMany have suggested that torture is a greater evil than killing or\neven murder. For example, Michael Davis claims, \u201cBoth torture\nand (premature) death are very great evils but, if one is a greater\nevil than the other, it is certainly torture\u201d (2005: 165), and\nDavid Sussman says, \u201cYet while there is a very strong moral\npresumption against both killing and torturing a human being, it seems\nthat we take the presumption against torture to be even greater than\nthat against homicide\u201d (2005: 15).\n\nCertainly, torturing an innocent person to death is worse than murder,\nfor it involves torture in addition to murder. On the other hand,\ntorture does not necessarily involve killing, let alone murder, and\nindeed torturers do not necessarily have the power of life and death\nover their victims. Consider police officers whose superiors turn a\nblind eye to their illegal use of torture, but who do not, and could\nnot, cover-up the murder of those tortured; the infliction of pain in\npolice cells can be kept secret, but not the existence of dead\nbodies.\n\nOn the moral wrongness of torture as compared to killing, the\nfollowing points can be made.\n\nFirst, torture is similar to killing in that both interrupt and render\nimpossible the normal conduct of human life, albeit the\nlatter \u2013 but not the former \u2013 necessarily forever. But equally\nduring the period a person is being tortured (and in some cases\nthereafter) the person\u2019s world is almost entirely taken up by\nextreme pain and their asymmetrical power relationship to the\ntorturer, i.e. the torture victim\u2019s powerlessness. Indeed, given\nthe extreme suffering being experienced and the consequent loss of\nautonomy, the victim would presumably rather be dead than alive during\nthat period. So, as already noted, torture is a very great evil.\nHowever, it does not follow from this that being killed is preferable\nto being tortured. Nor does it follow that torturing someone is\nmorally worse than killing him.\n\nIt does not follow that being killed is preferable to being tortured\nbecause the duration of the torture might be brief, one\u2019s will\nmight not ultimately be broken, and one might go on to live a long and\nhappy life; by contrast, being killed \u2013 theological considerations\naside \u2013 is always \u2018followed by\u2019 no life whatsoever.\nFor the same reason it does not follow that torturing a person is\nmorally worse than killing that person. If the harm brought about by\nan act of torture is a lesser evil than the harm done by an act of\nkilling then, other things being equal, the latter is morally worse\nthan the former.\n\nA second point pertains to the powerlessness of the victims of\ntorture. Dead people necessarily have no autonomy or power; so killing\npeople is an infringement of their right to autonomy as well as their\nright to\n life.[11]\n What of the victims of torture?\n\nThe person being tortured is for the duration of the torturing process\nphysically powerless in relation to the torturer. By\n\u201cphysically powerless\u201d two things are meant: the victim is\ndefenceless, i.e., the victim cannot prevent the torturer from\ntorturing the victim, and the victim is unable to attack, and\ntherefore physically harm, the torturer. Nevertheless, it does not\nfollow from this that the victim is entirely powerless\nvis-\u00e0-vis the torturer. For the victim might be able to\nstrongly influence the torturer\u2019s actions, either by virtue of\nhaving at this time the power to harm people other than the torturer,\nor by virtue of having at some future time the power to defend\nhim/herself against the torturer, and/or attack the torturer. Consider\nthe clich\u00e9d example of the terrorist who is refusing to\ndisclose to the torturer the whereabouts of a bomb with a timing\ndevice which is about to explode in a crowded market-place. Perhaps\nthe terrorist could negotiate the cessation of torture and immunity\nfor himself, if he talks. Consider also a situation in which both a\nhostage and his torturer know that it is only a matter of an hour\nbefore the police arrive, free the hostage and arrest the torturer;\nperhaps the hostage is a defence official who is refusing to disclose\nthe whereabouts of important military documents and who is\nstrengthened in his resolve by this knowledge of the limited duration\nof the pain being inflicted upon him.\n\nThe conclusion to be drawn from these considerations is that torture\nis not necessarily morally worse than killing (or more undesirable\nthan death), though in many instances it may well be. Killing is an\ninfringement of the right to life and the right to autonomy. Torture\nis an infringement of the right to autonomy, but not necessarily of\nthe right to life. Moreover, torture is consistent with the retrieval\nof the victim\u2019s autonomy, whereas killing is not. On the other\nhand, the period during which the victim is being tortured is surely\nworse than not being alive during that time, and torture can in\nprinciple extend for the duration of the remainder of a person\u2019s\nlife. Further, according to our adopted definition, torture is an\nintentional or purposive attack on a person\u2019s autonomy; this is\nnot necessarily the case with\n killing.[12]\n Finally, torture can in principle involve the effective destruction\nof a person\u2019s autonomy.\n\nLet us now turn directly to the question of the moral justification\nfor torture in extreme emergencies. Here we must distinguish between\none-off cases of torture, on the one hand, and legalised or\ninstitutionalised torture, on the other.\n3. The Moral Justification for One-off Acts of Torture in Emergencies\n\nIn this section one-off, non-institutionalised acts of torture\nperformed by state actors in emergency situations are considered. The\nargument is that there are, or could well be, one-off acts of torture\nin extreme emergencies that are, all things considered, morally\njustifiable. Accordingly, the assumption is that the routine\nuse of torture is not morally justified; so if it turned out that the\nroutine use of torture was necessary to, say, win the war on\nterrorism, then some of what is said here would not be to the point.\nHowever, liberal democratic governments and security agencies have not\neven begun to exhaust the political strategies, and the\nmilitary/police tactics short of the routine use of torture, available\nto them to combat terrorism.\n\nThe most obvious version of the argument in favour of one-off acts of\ntorture in extreme emergencies is consequentialist in form. For\nexample, Bagaric and Clarke (2007: 29) offer a version of the ticking\nbomb scenario in the context of their hedonistic act utilitarian\ntheoretical perspective. A standard objection to this kind of appeal\nto consequentialism is that it licenses far too much: torture of a few\ninnocent victims may well be justified, on this account, if it\nprovides intense pleasure for a much larger number of sadists. As it\nhappens, Bagaric and Clarke insist that they want to restrict the\npractice of torture; only the guilty are to be subjected to torture\nand only for the purpose of extracting information. However it is far\nfrom clear how this desired restriction can be reconciled with\nconsequentialism in any of its various permutations, let alone the\nrelatively permissive version favoured by Bagaric and Clarke. Why, for\nexample, should torture be restricted to the guilty, if torturing a\nsmall number of innocent persons would enable the lives of many other\ninnocents to be saved (as presumably it might). Again, why should\nunder-resourced Indian police not torture \u2013 as they often do in\nreality \u2013 a repeat offender responsible for a very large number of\nproperty crimes, if this proves to be the only available efficient and\neffective form of retrieving the stolen property in question and,\nthereby, securing the conviction of this offender, reducing property\ncrime and making a large number of property owners happy? The\nessential problem confronted by consequentialists participating in the\ntorture debate is that their theoretically admissible moral barriers\nto torture are relatively flimsy; too flimsy, it seems, to accommodate\nthe strong moral intuitions in play.\n\nFaced with the slippery slope, as they see it, of one-off acts of\ntorture in extreme emergencies transmogrifying into institutionalised\ntorture, and/or simply appalled by the inherent evil of the practice\nof torture, many theorists \u2013 Arrigo (2004), Davis (2005), Luban\n(2005), Juratowitch (2008), Mayerfield (2008), Brecher (2008),\nMatthews (2008), and Shue (2016) \u2013 have opted for the opposite\nextreme and argued that torture can never be morally justified. Most\nof these theorists avoid the problems besetting consequentialists such\nas Bagaric and Clarke, and they are on strong ground when providing\ncounter-arguments to consequentialist perspectives and/or views that\nseek to justify torturing the innocent. (But see Arrigo 2004.)\nHowever, their moral absolutism is not without its own problems:\nspecifically, in relation to torturing the guilty few for the purpose\nof saving the innocent many. (See Walzer 1973, Miller 2005; Kershnar\n2006 and Steinhoff 2013.)\n\nBefore turning in detail to the arguments on this issue, let us\nconsider some putative examples of the justified use of torture. The\nfirst is a policing example, the second a terrorist example. Arguably,\nboth examples are realistic, albeit the terrorist ticking bomb\nscenario is often claimed by moral absolutists to be utterly fanciful.\nCertainly, the policing example is realistic; indeed, it was provided\nby a former police officer from his own experience. Moreover, it is\nwidely reported in the media that Al Qaeda, for example, has in the\npast sought to acquire a nuclear device to detonate in a western city\nand the 9/11 attacks and bombings in Bali, London, Madrid and Mumbai\nshould leave no doubt whatsoever that Al Qaeda would use such a device\nif they could get their hands on one. So is it entirely fanciful that\nthere could be such an attack and that an Al Qaeda operative known (on\nthe basis of intercepted communications) to be a member of the cell\ninvolved in the planned attack might not be arrested, interrogated and\ntortured(?) prior to the detonation? At any rate, these are the two\nmost popular kinds of example discussed in the literature. These cases\ninclude the real-life Daschner case involving the threat to torture a\nkidnapper by German police in 2002 which resulted in the kidnapper\ndisclosing the location of a kidnapped child (Miller 2005).\n3.1 Case Study \u2013 The Beating\n\nConsider the following case study:\n\n\n\nHeight of the antipodean summer, Mercury at the century-mark; the\nnoonday sun softened the bitumen beneath the tyres of her little\nHyundai sedan to the consistency of putty. Her three year old son,\nquiet at last, snuffled in his sleep on the back seat. He had a summer\ncold and wailed like a banshee in the supermarket, forcing her to cut\nshort her shopping. Her car needed petrol. Her tot was asleep on the\nback seat. She poured twenty litres into the tank; thumbing notes from\nher purse, harried and distracted, her keys dangled from the\nignition.\n\nWhilst she was in the service station a man drove off in her car.\nPolice wound back the service station\u2019s closed-circuit TV\ncamera, saw what appeared to be a heavy set Pacific Islander with a\nblonde-streaked Afro entering her car. \u201cDon\u2019t\npanic\u201d, a police constable advised the mother, \u201cas soon as\nhe sees your little boy in the back he will abandon the car.\u201d He\ndid; police arrived at the railway station before the car thief did\nand arrested him after a struggle when he vaulted over the station\nbarrier.\n\nIn the police truck on the way to the police station: \u201cWhere did\nyou leave the Hyundai?\u201d Denial instead of dissimulation:\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d It was \u2013 property stolen from\nthe car was found in his pockets. In the detectives\u2019 office:\n\u201cIt\u2019s been twenty minutes since you took the\ncar \u2013 little tin box like that car \u2013 It will heat up like an\noven under this sun. Another twenty minutes and the child\u2019s dead\nor brain damaged. Where did you dump the car?\u201d Again: \u201cIt\nwasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\nAppeals to decency, to reason, to self-interest: \u201cIt\u2019s not\ntoo late; tell us where you left the car and you will only be charged\nwith Take-and-Use. That\u2019s just a six month extension of your\nrecognizance.\u201d Threats: \u201cIf the child dies I will charge\nyou with Manslaughter!\u201d Sneering, defiant and belligerent; he\nmade no secret of his contempt for the police. Part-way through his\numpteenth, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me\u201d, a questioner clipped him\nacross the ear as if he were a child, an insult calculated to bring\nthe Islander to his feet to fight, there a body-punch elicited a roar\nof pain, but he fought back until he lapsed into semi-consciousness\nunder a rain of blows. He quite enjoyed handing out a bit of biffo,\nbut now, kneeling on hands and knees in his own urine, in pain he had\nnever known, he finally realised the beating would go on until he told\nthe police where he had abandoned the child and the car.\n\nThe police officers\u2019 statements in the prosecution brief made no\nmention of the beating; the location of the stolen vehicle and the\ninfant inside it was portrayed as having been volunteered by the\ndefendant. The defendant\u2019s counsel availed himself of this\nfalsehood in his plea in mitigation. When found, the stolen child was\ndehydrated, too weak to cry; there were ice packs and dehydration in\nthe casualty ward but no long-time prognosis on brain damage.\n\n(Case Study provided by John Blackler, a former New South Wales police\nofficer.)\n\n\nIn this case study torture of the car thief can be provided with a\nsubstantial moral justification, even if it does not convince\neveryone. Consider the following points: (1) The police reasonably\nbelieve that torturing the car thief will probably save an innocent\nlife; (2) the police know that there is no other way to save the life;\n(3) the threat to life is more or less imminent; (4) the baby is\ninnocent; (5) the car thief is known not to be an innocent \u2013 his\naction is known to have caused the threat to the baby, and he is\nrefusing to allow the baby\u2019s life to be saved.\n\nThe classic, indeed clich\u00e9, example used to justify torture is\nthat of the so-called \u2018ticking\n bomb\u2019.[13]\n (See Bufacchi & Arrigo 2006, Kleinig 2006, Hill 2007, Kaufman\n2008, Segev 2008, Wisnewski 2009 and Steinhoff 2013.) Consider\nthe following case.\n3.2 Case Study \u2013 The Terrorist and the Ticking Bomb\n\nConsider the following case study:\n\n\nA terrorist group has planted a small nuclear device with a timing\nmechanism in London and it is about to go off. If it does it will kill\nthousands and make a large part of the city uninhabitable for decades.\nOne of the terrorists has been captured by the police, and if he can\nbe made to disclose the location of the device then the police can\nprobably disarm it and thereby save the lives of thousands. The police\nknow the terrorist in question. They know he has orchestrated\nterrorist attacks, albeit non-nuclear ones, in the past. Moreover, on\nthe basis of intercepted mobile phone calls and e-mails the police\nknow that this attack is under way in some location in London and that\nhe is the leader of the group. Unfortunately, the terrorist is\nrefusing to talk and time is slipping away. However, the police know\nthat there is a reasonable chance that he will talk, if tortured.\nMoreover, all their other sources of information have dried up.\nFurthermore, there is no other way to avoid catastrophe; evacuation of\nthe city, for example, cannot be undertaken in the limited time\navailable. Torture is not normally used by the police, and indeed it\nis unlawful to use it.\n\n\nIn this case study there is also a substantial moral justification for\ntorture, albeit one that many moral absolutists do not find\ncompelling. Consider the following points: (1) The police reasonably\nbelieve that torturing the terrorist will probably save thousands of\ninnocent lives; (2) the police know that there is no other way to save\nthose lives; (3) the threat to life is more or less imminent; (4) the\nthousands about to be murdered are innocent \u2013 the terrorist has no\ngood, let alone decisive, justificatory moral reason for murdering\nthem; (5) the terrorist is known to be (jointly with the other\nterrorists) morally responsible for planning, transporting, and arming\nthe nuclear device and, if it explodes, he will be (jointly with the\nother terrorists) morally responsible for the murder of thousands.\n\nIn addition to the above set of moral considerations, consider the\nfollowing points. The terrorist is culpable on two counts. Firstly,\nthe terrorist is forcing the police to choose between two evils,\nnamely, torturing the terrorist or allowing thousands of lives to be\nlost. Were the terrorist to do what he ought to do, namely, disclose\nthe location of the ticking bomb, the police could refrain from\ntorturing him. This would be true of the terrorist, even if he were\nnot actively participating in the bombing project. Secondly, the\nterrorist is in the process of completing his (jointly undertaken)\naction of murdering thousands of innocent people. He has already\nundertaken his individual actions of, say, transporting and arming the\nnuclear device; he has performed these individual actions (in the\ncontext of other individual actions performed by the other members of\nthe terrorist cell) in order to realise the end (shared by the other\nmembers of the cell) of murdering thousands of Londoners. In refusing\nto disclose the location of the device the terrorist is preventing the\npolice from preventing him from completing his (joint) action of\nmurdering thousands of innocent\n people.[14]\n To this extent the terrorist is in a different situation from a\nbystander who happens to know where the bomb is planted but will not\nreveal its whereabouts, and in a different situation from someone who\nmight have inadvertently put life at risk (Miller (2005); Hill\n(2007)).\n\nIn the institutional environment described, torture is both unlawful\nand highly unusual. Accordingly the police, if it is discovered that\nthey have tortured the terrorist, would be tried for a serious crime\nand, if found guilty, sentenced. We will return to this issue in the\nfollowing section. Here simply note that the bare illegality of their\nact of torture does not render it morally impermissible, given it was\notherwise morally permissible. Here it is the bare fact that it is\nillegal that is in question. So the relevant moral considerations\ncomprise whatever moral weight attaches to compliance with the law\njust for the sake of compliance with the law, as distinct from\ncompliance for the sake of the public benefits the law brings or\ncompliance because of the moral weight that attaches to the moral\nprinciple that a particular law might embody. But even if it is held\nthat compliance with the law for its own sake has some moral\nweight \u2013 and arguably it has none \u2013 it does not have\nsufficient moral weight to make a decisive difference in this kind of\nscenario. In short, if torturing the terrorist is morally permissible\nabsent questions of legality, the bare fact of torture being illegal\ndoes not render it morally impermissible.\n\nNote also that since the terrorist is, when being tortured, still in\nthe process of attempting to complete his (joint) action of murdering\nthousands of Londoners, and murdering also the police about to torture\nhim, the post factum legal defence of necessity may well be\navailable to the police should they subsequently be tried for\n torture.[15]\n\nSome commentators on scenarios of this kind are reluctant to concede\nthat the police are morally entitled \u2013 let alone morally\nobliged \u2013 to torture the offender. How do these commentators\njustify their position?\n\nSomeone might claim that torture is an absolute moral wrong (Matthews\n2008; Brecher 2008). (For criticisms of these authors see\nespecially Steinhoff 2013 and Allhoff 2012.) On this view there\nsimply are no real or imaginable circumstances in which torture could\nbe morally justified.\n\nThis is a hard view to sustain, not least because we have already seen\nthat being tortured is not necessarily worse than being killed, and\ntorturing someone not necessarily morally worse than killing him.\nNaturally, someone might hold that killing is an absolute moral wrong,\ni.e., killing anyone \u2013 no matter how guilty \u2013 is never morally\njustified. This view is consistent with holding that torture is an\nabsolute moral wrong, i.e. torturing anyone \u2013 no matter how\nguilty \u2013 is never morally justified. However, the price of\nconsistency is very high. The view that killing is an absolute moral\nwrong is a very implausible one. It would rule out, for example,\nkilling in self-defence. Let us, therefore, set it aside and continue\nwith the view that torture, but not killing, is an absolute moral\nwrong.\n\nFor those who hold that killing is not an absolute moral wrong, it is\nvery difficult to see how torture could be an absolute moral wrong,\ngiven that killing is sometimes morally worse than torture. In\nparticular, it is difficult to see how torturing (but not killing) the\nguilty terrorist and saving the lives of thousands could be morally\nworse than refraining from torturing him and allowing him to murder\nthousands \u2013 torturing the terrorist is a temporary infringement of\nhis autonomy, whereas his detonating of the nuclear device is a\npermanent violation of the autonomy of thousands.\n\nIn conclusion, the view that it is, all things considered, morally\nwrong to torture the terrorist in the scenario outlined faces very\nserious objections; and it is difficult to see how these objections\ncan be met. It is plausible, therefore, that there are some imaginable\ncircumstances in which it is morally permissible to torture\nsomeone.\n\nLet us now turn to the other argument of those opposing the moral\npermissibility of torture mentioned above. This is not the argument\nthat torture is an absolute moral wrong but rather that, as Michael\nDavis puts it, \u201cFor all practical purposes \u2013 and so, for\nmoral agents like us \u2013 torture is absolutely morally wrong\u201d\n(2005: 170). The basic idea is that while torture is not an absolute\nmoral wrong in the sense that the evil involved in performing any act\nof torture is so great as to override any other conceivable set of\nmoral considerations, nevertheless, there are no moral considerations\nthat in the real world have overridden, or ever will override, the\nmoral injunction against torture; the principle of refraining from\ntorture has always trumped, and will always trump, other moral\nimperatives. Proponents of this view can happily accept that the\noffenders in putative examples should be tortured, while\nsimultaneously claiming that the scenarios in these examples are\nentirely fanciful ones that have never been, and will never be,\nrealised in the real world.\n\nIt is important to stress here that the kind of scenario under\ndiscussion remains that of the one-off case of torture in an emergency\nsituation; what is not under consideration in this section is\nlegalised, or otherwise institutionalised, torture.\n\nThe central claim of the proponents of \u201cpractical moral\nabsolutes\u201d seems to be an empirical one; ticking bomb scenarios,\nsuch as our above-described terrorist case \u2013 and other relevant\none-off emergencies such as our above-described police beating case in\nwhich torture seems to be justified \u2013 have not, and will not,\nhappen.\n\nThe first point to be made is simply to reiterate that some of these\nscenarios \u2013 such as police officers beating up kidnappers and\nother offenders to rescue children \u2013 are not only realistic, they\nare real; they have actually happened. What of the ticking bomb\nscenario in particular? As stated above, it is by no means\nself-evident that this kind of scenario is entirely fanciful. Here it\ncan be conceded that there is no guarantee that torture would succeed\nin saving the lives of (to revert to our specific ticking bomb\nscenario) thousands of Londoners. This is because the person tortured\nmight not talk or he might talk too late or he might provide false or\nmisleading information. However, it should be noted that the police\nknow that the offender has committed the offence and is in a\nposition to provide the needed information, i.e. the police know that\nthe offender is guilty. Moreover, the information being sought is\ncheckable; if the terrorist gives the correct location of the bomb\nthen the police will find it \u2013 if he does not, then they will not\nfind it. Further, the police have no alternative methods by which to\navoid the death of the innocent. Given what is at stake and given the\nfact that the police know the offenders are guilty, the police are, it\nseems, justified in the use of torture, notwithstanding a degree of\nuncertainty in relation to the likelihood of success. (See Thiessen\n(2010) for arguments that so-called enhanced interrogation techniques\ndo in fact work.)\n\nThe second point is that, practicalities notwithstanding, the\nproponents of \u201cpractical moral absolutes\u201d still need to\noffer a principled account of the moral limits to torture \u2013 an\naccount of torture, so to speak, in the abstract. And these accounts\ncould differ from one advocate of practical moral absolutes to\nanother. For example, one advocate might accept that it would be\nmorally permissible to torture the terrorist to save the lives of ten\ninnocent people threatened by a non-nuclear explosive device, whereas\nanother advocate might reject this on the grounds that ten lives are\ntoo few. What the two advocates would have in common is the belief\nthat even the revised ticking-bomb scenario involving only the death\nof ten innocent people is, nevertheless, a fanciful scenario that has\nnot occurred, and will not ever occur. In short, different advocates\nof practical absolutism can ascribe different moral weight to\ndifferent moral considerations, and we need to know what these\nweightings are for any given advocate. For otherwise it is extremely\ndifficult to assess the validity or plausibility of the associated\ngeneral empirical claim that in practice no act of torture has ever\nbeen, nor ever will be, morally justified. Roughly speaking, the\ngreater the moral weight that is given by the practical moral\nabsolutist to refraining from torture \u2013 this moral weight\nconsidered both in itself and relative to other moral\nconsiderations \u2013 the more plausible the associated general\nempirical claim becomes. On the other hand, the greater the\nmoral weight that is given to the principle of refraining from\ntorture, the less plausible the narrowly moral claims of the\npractical absolutist become \u2013 indeed, at the limit the practical\nabsolutist becomes a moral absolutist tout court.\n\nAt any rate, the general point to be made here is that the practical\nmoral absolutist owes us a principled account of the moral weight to\nbe attached to refraining from torture relative to other moral\nconsiderations. For without it we are unable to adequately assess\nwhether or not putative counter-examples to this position are really\ncounter-examples or not. It is not good enough for the practical moral\nabsolutist just to give the thumbs down to any putative\ncounter-example that is offered.\n\nThe third general point against the practical moral absolutist is to\nreiterate that it has already been argued that torture is not the\nmorally worst act that anyone could, or indeed has or will, perform.\nIf this is correct, then it is plausible that there will be at least\nsome scenarios in which one will be forced to choose between\ntwo evils, the lesser one of which is torture. Indeed, the\nabove-described police beating scenario (certainly) and the ticking\nbomb scenario (possibly) are cases in point.\n4. The Moral Justification for Legalised and Institutionalised Torture\n\nWe have seen that there are likely to exist, in the real world,\none-off emergency situations in which arguably torture is, all things\nconsidered, the morally best action to perform. It may seem to follow\nthat institutional arrangements should be in place to facilitate\ntorture in such situations. However, it is perfectly consistent to\nconcede that torture might be morally justifiable in certain one-off\nemergency situations and yet oppose any legalization or\ninstitutionalization of torture.\n\nLuban (2005) and (2014), and Waldron (2005), in particular, have drawn\nattention to the moral inconsistency and inherent danger in liberal\ndemocratic states legalising and institutionalising torture, a\npractice that strikes at the very heart of the fundamental liberal\nvalue of individual autonomy. They have also detailed the tendency for\na torture culture to develop in organisations in which torture is\nlegalised or tolerated, a culture in which the excesses of torturing\nthe innocent and the like take place, as in the US army detention\ncentres in Abu Ghraib in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and in the\nIsraeli secret service (General Security Service). Nevertheless, it is\nuseful to sketch a general argument against the legalisation and\ninstitutionalisation of torture. The argument is consistent with,\nindeed at some points it is more or less the same as, the arguments of\nLuban and Waldron. However, the argument has some novel elements, not\nthe least of which is the claim that the view that torture is morally\njustified in some extreme emergencies is compatible with the view that\ntorture ought not to be legalised and institutionalised.\n\nMost of the theorists who oppose the legalisation and\ninstitutionalisation of torture also (at least implicitly) reject the\npossibility, let alone actuality, of one-off emergencies in which\ntorture is morally justified. The argument has been put that there\nare, or could well be, such one-off extreme emergencies in which\ntorture is morally justified. So the first task here is to demonstrate\nthat these two claims are not inconsistent. Specifically, it needs to\nbe shown that it does not follow from the fact that torture is in some\nextreme emergencies morally justified, that torture ought to be\nlegalised, or otherwise institutionalised. So the claim is that it is\njust a mistake to assume that what morality requires or permits in a\ngiven situation must be identical with what the law requires or\npermits in that situation. This calls for some explanation.\n\nThe law in particular, and social institutions more generally, are\nblunt instruments. They are designed to deal with recurring situations\nconfronted by numerous institutional actors over relatively long\nperiods of time. Laws abstract away from differences between\nsituations across space and time, and differences between\ninstitutional actors across space and time. The law, therefore,\nconsists of a set of generalisations to which the particular situation\nmust be made to fit. Hence, if you exceed the speed limit you are\nliable for a fine, even though you were only 10 kph above the speed\nlimit, you have a superior car, you are a superior driver, there was\nno other traffic on the road, the road conditions were perfect, and\ntherefore the chances of you having an accident were actually less\nthan would be the case for most other people most of the time driving\nat or under the speed\n limit.[16]\n\nBy contrast with the law, morality is a sharp instrument. Morality can\nbe, and typically ought to be, made to apply to a given situation in\nall its particularity. (This is, of course, not to say that there are\nnot recurring moral situations in respect of which the same moral\njudgment should be made, nor is it to say that morality does not need\nto help itself to generalisations.) Accordingly, what might be, all\nthings considered, the morally best action for an agent to perform in\nsome one-off, i.e. non-recurring, situation might not be an action\nthat should be made lawful. Consider the real-life example of the five\nsailors on a raft in the middle of the ocean and without food. Four of\nthem decide to eat the fifth \u2013 the cabin boy \u2013 in order to\n survive.[17]\n This is a case of both murder and cannibalism. Was it morally\npermissible to kill and eat the boy, given the alternative was the\ndeath of all five sailors? Clearly it was not pro tanto morally\npermissible, especially given the cabin boy was entirely innocent; but\nperhaps it was morally permissible all things considered. And even if\nit was not morally permissible all things considered, nevertheless,\narguably it was morally excusable, and indeed the sailors, although\nconvicted of murder and cannibalism, had their sentence commuted in\nrecognition of this. But there was no suggestion that the laws against\nmurder and cannibalism admit of an exception in such an extreme case;\nthe sailors were convicted and sentenced for murder and cannibalism.\nAgain, consider an exceptionless law against desertion from the\nbattlefield in time of war. Perhaps a soldier is morally justified in\ndeserting his fellow soldiers, given that he learns of the more\nmorally pressing need for him to care for his wife who has contracted\nsome life-threatening disease back home. However, the law against\ndesertion will not, and should not, be changed to allow desertion in\nsuch cases.\n\nSome theorists (Allhoff 2012) have invoked the legal\nprinciple of necessity in order to establish that torture in some\nextreme circumstances is or should be legally permissible (Gaeta\n2004; Hunsinger 2008). However, the legal principle of necessity\nis inherently (and intentionally) vague. It typically applies to\nsituations in which someone has infringed a law, but done so to avert\na greater evil which is otherwise unavoidable. Here the notion of\ngreater evil is radically underspecified and, therefore, in need of\ninterpretation by the courts in any given case. Moreover, the\napplication of the principle of legal necessity in cases in which it\nis state operatives who invoke it, such as in cases of torture by the\nmembers of security agencies, is fraught with danger. For the\nprotection of the rights of citizens not to be tortured is likely to\nbe significantly reduced if there is a legal justification for torture\navailable to members of security agencies. Given the inherent\nvagueness of the notion of lesser evil, there is the potential in\ntheir adjudications for judges to favour the members of security\nagencies at the expense of ordinary citizens.\n\nWe will shortly turn to arguments to the effect that while there may\nwell be morally justifiable one-off cases of torturing the guilty, it\ndoes not follow that torture should ever be legalised, even in such\ncases. However, it has been suggested by Steinhoff (2010) and (2013)\nthat torturing the guilty can in many cases be understood as torturing\nthe guilty in self-defence. If so, presumably torturing the guilty\ncould reasonably be legalised on the grounds that torturing in\nself-defence is analogous to killing in self-defence, and self-defence\nis an explicit legal justification for killing in most jurisdictions.\nSteinhoff has also suggested (2006, 2013) that legalisation would not\nnecessarily lead to institutionalisation in the sense of the creation\nof the institutional role of a torturer, the routinisation and\nbureaucratisation of the process of torture, and so on.\n\nTorturing the guilty in self-defence is arguably something of a\nmisnomer. Firstly, it is not really self defence per se, but rather\nthe saving of the lives of others. After all, generally the would-be\ntorturer\u2019s life is not at risk, and even if it is at risk in a\nparticular location, as in some terrorist bombing scenarios, then\npresumably the risk can be averted by the torturer simply abandoning\nhis immobilised victim and fleeing the area. Note that on many\naccounts self defence is a more readily acceptable moral justification\nor excuse for killing an attacker than is defending the lives of\nothers (at least, others who are not members of one\u2019s family or\nclose friends). Secondly, torturing in order to save life is\ninherently unreliable by comparison with killing in self-defence. This\nis because killing an attacker is directly connected to the desired\noutcome of removing the threat; indeed, to kill the attacker is to\nremove the threat. This is not so with torture. Rather torturing is\none action and removing the threat (e.g., disarming the ticking bomb)\nis another act necessarily at some causal remove from the first\naction. Moreover, the putative (necessarily indirect) causal\nconnections between the two actions may well not obtain. Thirdly,\ntorturing the guilty to save innocent lives does not typically involve\nan imminent threat, as typically must be the case in instances of\nlawful self-defence in well-ordered jurisdictions. For the threat\nposed by (say) a terrorist-bomber is either imminent, as in the case\nof a suicide-bomber, in which case there is no time to torture anyone;\nor the threat is not imminent in which case there is time to pursue\nother options, such as intercepting the communications of other\nmembers of the terrorist cell and, thereby, locating the bomb. Again,\nconsider typical kidnapping cases. Either the kidnapper is not in\ncustody in which case he or she cannot be tortured; or the kidnapper\nis in custody in which case the threat to the kidnapped child from the\nkidnapper in custody is not imminent (the child is either dead or is\nalive and no longer under threat from the kidnapper in custody).\nNaturally, as we saw in the last section, there may well be a very\nsmall number of exceptional cases in which the threat is more or less\nimminent and torture is, nevertheless, a realistic option for removing\nthe threat (and, indeed, the only option). Accordingly, this small\nnumber of exceptional cases might be analogous to killing in\nself-defence. Moreover, in some torturing the guilty scenarios the all\nthings considered morally best option might be to torture the guilty\nparty; indeed the general argument for the latter proposition was\noutlined in the last section. However, this does not demonstrate that\njustified torturing of the guilty to save the innocent they threaten\nis essentially a species of justified self-defence and that,\ntherefore, it ought to be legalised.\n\nIt is consistent with the rejection of explicit legalisation of the\ntorturing of the guilty that, as noted above, there be some form of\nlegal redress in the very small number of exceptional cases of\ntorturing the guilty in which the threat to the innocent is imminent\n(and torture is morally justifiable all things considered). These\nforms of legal redress for the torturer might include the existence of\nmitigating circumstances or the application of the legal principle of\nnecessity \u2013 since the cases in question involve a genuinely\ndilemmatic situation in which the least harmful of the available\noptions was chosen and chosen to the advantage of the innocent rather\nthan the guilty.\n\nThe upshot of this discussion is that torturing the guilty to save the\nlives of the innocent is not analogous to killing in self-defence.\nSpecifically, the legalisation of torturing the guilty faces the\nproblem of imminence; unlike killing in self-defence it almost never\ninvolves an imminent threat. Accordingly, the legalisation of\ntorturing the guilty is likely to be regarded as extremely\nproblematic, since presumably legalisation is likely to result in\ninstitutionalisation. Consider in this connection police killing in\ndefence of the lives of innocent citizens. This involves the creation\nof the institutional role of police sniper with all its attendant\ntraining, development and implementation of procedures (including the\nrequirement that the threat be imminent before shots are fired) and,\nmore generally, bureaucratisation. This is, of course, not to say that\n(as argued above) certain one-off cases of torturing the guilty might\nnot be both morally justifiable and legally excusable (or otherwise be\nable to avail themselves of mitigating circumstances). \n\nAs already noted and contrary to the above-mentioned presumption,\nSteinhoff insists that legalization does not in fact necessarily lead\nto institutionalization. Specifically, he argues that the legalization\nof killing in self-defence has not led to its institutionalization,\nand he also claims (as we have seen) that torturing in self-defence is\nakin to killing in self-defence. As we have seen, the proposition that\ntorturing the guilty to save lives is analogous to killing in\nself-defence is open to question and there is surely at least a\npresumption that legalisation will lead to institutionalisation.\nHowever, there is a further more specific point to be made here in\nrelation to legalisation and institutionalisation. It is true that\nindividualistic killing in self-defence on the part of private\ncitizens has not led to institutionalization, but this is because it\nis an individual, non-institutional activity which is subject to\nstringent institutional accountability mechanisms (at least in\nwell-ordered liberal democratic states). But it is extremely doubtful\nthat an individual citizen is ever going to be in a situation where he\nhas to defend his life by torturing his attacker. What we are talking\nabout in this debate is the killing or torturing by institutional\nactors, e.g., police, of persons who are attacking third parties\n(whether by killing, kidnapping etc.); the third parties in question\nare, typically, members of the community. As noted above, the\nlegalized killing by police of third parties has been\ninstitutionalized (police snipers). So evidently killing in\nself-defence does not constitute a relevant case in which there is\nlegalization but not institutionalization.\n\nWhether or not torture is likely to be institutionalised once\nlegalised, or is even likely to be institutionalised if not actively\nresisted on an ongoing basis, is partly a matter of the\nmotivational drivers in play. And unfortunately, even in liberal\ndemocracies, when the threat to the community is regarded as\nsubstantial, institutional actors (such as police and military\npersonnel) have been willing to engage in routinised extra-judicial\nkilling (India, today) and more than willing to engage in routinised\ntorture (use of the third degree by police agencies world-wide). In\ndoing so, they have typically appealed to a self-defence moral\njustification (\u2018We had to torture/kill in order to save\nlives\u2019). Moreover, in the case of the extra-judicial killings\nthey have typically helped themselves to and often been aided by the\nlegal justification of self-defence \u2013 \u2018the Naxalites (in\nIndia) shot at us first and we fired back in self-defence\u2019\n(albeit what has also been revealed over time is a culture of\n\u2018shoot first and ask questions later\u2019). Torture is much\nmore prevalent than killing in part because (as Steinhoff argues)\ntorture is rightly regarded as not necessarily as bad as killing\n(criminals tortured by police are typically able to carry on with\ntheir lives, even if in prison) and perhaps also in part because\ntorture is less susceptible to the available accountability measures\n(you cannot hide corpses, at least in liberal democracies). In short,\nthere is good reason to believe that legalizing torture in contexts in\nwhich there is a substantial threat to the community will lead to its\ninstitutionalization.\n\nIt has been noted on a number of occasions that the law and morality\ncan and do come apart. Moreover, it is plausible that sometimes they\nought to come apart. A further point to be elaborated here\npertains to the nature of the sub-institution of torture within the\nlarger military, police, and correctional institutions. There is a\nneed to begin with a few preliminary remarks about social\n institutions.[18]\n\nSocial institutions, including legal institutions and military,\npolice, and correctional organisations, have both a massive collective\ninertia and a massive collective momentum by virtue of the\nparticipation in them of many agents over a long time who: (a) pursue\nthe same goals; (b) occupy the same roles and, therefore, perform the\nsame tasks and follow the same rules and procedures, and; (c) share\nthe same culture. Accordingly, social institutions and their component\norganisations are like very large ocean liners that cannot slow down,\nspeed up, or change direction very easily. It follows that very\ncareful thought needs to be given to the establishment of any\nadditional structure of roles and associated practices that is to be\nwoven into the fabric of the institution. For such an additional\n(embodied) role structure, once it becomes, so to speak, an integrated\nworking part of the larger institution, is likely to be extremely\ndifficult to remove; it is now a beneficiary of the inertia of the\ninstitution. Moreover such an additional, but now integrated, role\nstructure participates in, and influences the direction of, the\ninstitution; it is now a contributing element to the momentum of the\ninstitution.\n\nSo what can be said of the likely institutional fit between military,\npolice, and correctional institutions on the one hand, and the\nsub-institution of torture on the other? The role structure of this\nsub-institution consists of torturers, torturer trainers, medical\npersonnel who assist torturers, and the like. The core practice of\ntorture has been described in an earlier section.\n\nThe practice of torture is endemic in many, perhaps most, military,\npolice, and correctional institutions in the world today, including\ndemocracies such as India. It is only in recent times and with great\ndifficulty that torture in Australian prisons and police services, for\nexample, has been largely eliminated, or at least very significantly\nreduced. The Australian, British, American, and like cases are\nimportant not only because they illustrate that torture can be endemic\nto liberal democratic institutions, but also because they demonstrate\nthat liberal democratic institutions are able \u2013 given the\npolitical will, suitable re-education and training, stringent\naccountability mechanisms, etc. \u2013 to successfully combat a culture\nof torture.\n\nLet us look at some of the evidence from the past. Consider police\norganisations in liberal democracies such as the USA. The influential\nReport on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement from the National\nCommission on Law Observance and Enforcement, also know as the\nWickersham Commission, in 1931 found that the use of the third degree\nwas widespread throughout police organisations in the USA (National\nCommission on Law Observance and Enforcement 1931, 4). More recently,\nwe have the Rampart Reports documenting extensive police\nbrutality \u2013 including extra-judicial killings (Parks 2000,\n87\u2013109; Rampart Independent Review Panel 2000, 11\u201314)\n \u2013 and, in the wake of the Rodney King beating, the report of the\n\u201cChristopher Commission\u201d into the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment which found that a significant number of LAPD officers\n\u201crepetitively use excessive force against the public and\npersistently ignore the written guidelines of the Department regarding\nforce\u201d (Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment 1991, 9\u201312). In India \u2013 another liberal\ndemocratic state, albeit one at an earlier stage of economic\ndevelopment \u2013 police brutality is institutionalised. According to\na recent Human Rights Watch Report (Human Rights Watch 2009: 14),\n\u201cpolice violence and misconduct are \u2026 widespread and\nrooted in institutional practice\u201d. Arvind Verma, an authority on\npolicing in India, states that \u201cMisuse of force, false-encounter\nkillings (execution by police) and routine use of torture in extorting\nconfessions are common with the police departments\u201d (Verma 2011:\n5).\n\nNow consider prisons in liberal democracies. In the USA in the past\nwidespread beatings and torture of prisoners (e.g., use of electrodes\non prisoners\u2019 private parts) has been documented in multiple\njurisdictions, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia\nand Florida. See, for example, Murton and Hyams\u2019 classic work,\nInside Prison, USA (Murton and Hyams 1969). In Australia\nthere was the Nagle Royal Commission into New South Wales Prisons.\nNagle reported systematic bashings in NSW prisons. He said of Grafton\nGaol, in particular, that it had a \u201cregime of terror\u201d,\n\u201c\u2026brutal, savage and sometimes sadistic\u201d (Nagle\n1978: 108). He concluded thus: \u201cIt is the view of the Commission\nthat every prison officer who served at Grafton during the time it was\nused as a gaol for intractables must have known of its brutal regime.\nThe majority of them, if not all, would have taken part in the illegal\nassaults on prisoners\u201d (Nagle 1978: 119).\n\nWhen it comes to authoritarian regimes matters are, of course, much\nworse. Let us set aside the infamous Soviet Gulags under Stalin and\nalso Hitler\u2019s concentration camps, and rather consider some more\nrecent examples. The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission\nstated that under the apartheid regime, \u201ctorture was used\nsystematically by the Security Branch, both as a means of obtaining\ninformation and of terrorising detainees and activists. Torture was\nnot confined to particular police stations, particular regions or\nparticular individual police officers\u201d (TRC 1998: 187). In Chile\nthe National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation (NCTR 1993: 1122)\ndetailed over 2000 victims of human rights violations by the security\nforces of the Pinochet regime of which victims approximately half were\nkilled (hundreds tortured to death) and the remaining half disappeared\nafter arrest. According to Juan Mendez (a UN Special Advisor who was\nhimself tortured during the Argentinean military dictatorship):\n\u201cTorture became systematic and pervasive during the military\ndictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s, but it would be a mistake to\ntrace its origins only as far as this dark era. In fact, torture was\nused by dictatorial as well as elected but authoritarian governments\nthroughout the twentieth century\u201d (Mendez 2005: 56).\n\nIn the light of the evidence it would be a massive understatement to\nsay that historically the sub-institution of torture \u2013 whether in\na lawful or unlawful form \u2013 has been no stranger to military,\npolice, and correctional institutions. Further, there is now a great\ndeal of empirical evidence that in institutional environments in which\ntorture is routinely practised it has a massive impact on other\npractices and on moral attitudes. For example, in police organisations\nin which torture is routinely used the quality of investigations and,\nin particular, of interviewing of suspects, tends to be low. Careful,\nlogically based, questioning on the basis of the available evidence is\nreplaced by beating up suspects. Thus lower echelon police\ninvestigators in India often have little or no training in best\npractice interviewing and (as noted above) they routinely use the\nthird degree. Again, Baldwin\u2019s findings based on hundreds of\ntaped interviews indicate that the interviewing skills of UK police\nduring the period of the infamous police use of the third degree\nagainst the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four and Maguire Seven would\nhave been quite poor (Baldwin 1993). Police in organisations in which\noffenders are routinely tortured do not, unsurprisingly, tend to\ndevelop respect for the moral rights of offenders, suspects, or even\nwitnesses. This is entirely consistent with the excesses detailed by\nLuban and Waldron in the US military detention centres in Iraq and\nelsewhere, e.g., the Abu Ghraib scandal, and in the case of the\ninterrogations of suspected terrorists by the Israeli secret service.\nIndeed, these excesses are to be expected.\n\nAnd there is this further point. The prevalence of torture in numerous\nmilitary, police, and correctional institutions throughout the world\nhas taken place notwithstanding that for the most part it has been\nboth unlawful and opposed by the citizenry.\n\nIt is to be concluded from all this that for the most part military,\npolice, and correctional institutions are qua institutions\nvery receptive to the practice of torture \u2013 even when it is\nunlawful \u2013 and that these institutions qua institutions\nwould relatively easily incorporate the legalised sub-institution of\ntorture; accordingly, it is very easy to legalise torture and thereby\ngrow and develop a torture culture in military, police and\ncorrectional institutions. This does not mean that there are not\nimportant differences between, say, police services in authoritarian\nstates and those in contemporary (though not necessarily historical)\nliberal democratic states; obviously there are. Nor does it mean that\nmost, or even the majority, of the individuals who occupy roles in\nthese institutions, whether in liberal democracies or elsewhere, are\nnecessarily receptive qua individuals to engaging in the\npractice of torture; most of them might not be. However, most of them\nwould not be torturing people; that would be done by a distinct\nminority, as in fact has usually been the case even in institutions in\nwhich torture is unlawful and endemic. The question is whether or not\nas individuals they would initially tolerate, and finally accept, the\npractice of torture, if it were legally and institutionally\nestablished; the suggestion is that the historical and comparative\nevidence is that they would, including in liberal democracies.\n\nA additional conclusion to be drawn is that should the legalised\nsub-institution of torture be integrated into any of these\ninstitutions it would be very difficult to remove and would, even in\nliberal democracies, have a major impact on the direction, culture,\nand practices of these institutions. Again, this is what the\nhistorical and comparative empirical evidence tells, notwithstanding\nthe initial and even continuing aversion of many, perhaps most, of the\nindividuals in these institutions to torture as such. Consider the\nIsraeli case. Limited forms of torture were legal in Israel prior to\n1999, but illegal post 1999. However, evidently torture has by no\nmeans been eradicated post 1999. According to the Public Committee\nAgainst Torture in Israel (PCATI), reporting on the period between\nSeptember 2001 and April 2003: \u201cThe affidavits and testimonies\ntaken by attorneys and fieldworkers\u2026 support the conclusions\n\u2026violence, painful tying, humiliations and many other forms of\nill-treatment, including detention under inhuman conditions, are a\nmatter of course\u2026.The bodies which are supposed to keep the GSS\n[General Security Service] under scrutiny and ensure that\ninterrogations are conducted lawfully act, instead, as rubberstamps\nfor decisions by the GSS\u2026The State Prosecutor\u2019s Office\ntransfers the interrogees\u2019 complaints to a GSS agent for\ninvestigation and it is little wonder that it has not found in even a\nsingle case that GSS agents tortured a Palestinian\n\u2018unnecessarily\u2019\u201d (PCATI 2003).\n\nThe deeper explanation for the prevalence of torture cultures and the\ndifficulty of eradicating institutionalised torture is no doubt very\ncomplex, but presumably it consists in part in the following elements:\n(1) moral docility, as opposed to physical docility, is a feature of\nindividuals housed in, and materially dependent upon, large,\nhierarchical, bureaucratic organisations with strong, relatively\nhomogenous cultures; (2) the roles of soldier, police officer, and\nprison warder necessarily involve the routine use of coercive, and\neven deadly, force against dangerous criminals, enemy soldiers, or\nterrorists, and therefore undertaking these roles inevitably results\nin a degree of moral de-sensitisation and a sense of moral ambiguity\nwhen it comes to torturing criminals and/or terrorists; (3) torture is\nan exercise of enormous power, and power is deeply seductive to many\npeople (and much less dangerous than shooting at armed enemy\ncombatants or trying to arrest or subdue violent criminals).\n\nArmed with these observations on the difference between law and\nmorality, and on the nature of the sub-institution of torture in\nmilitary, police, and correctional institutions, what now can be said\non the question as to whether or not to legalise and institutionalise\ntorture in contemporary well-ordered liberal democratic states\nundergoing a lengthy period of attacks from terrorist\norganisations?\n\nAs we saw above, torture is a terrorist tactic. Indeed, arguably it is\nthe terrorist tactic par excellence. Detonating bombs that\nkill the innocent has come to be regarded as the quintessential\nterrorist tactic. But this is presumably because terrorism has\nimplausibly come to be identified only with non-state terrorism. At\nany rate, the point to be made here is that torture is a terrorist\ntactic, and for a liberal democracy to legalise and institutionalise\nit, i.e. weave the practice of torture into the very fabric of liberal\ndemocratic institutions, would be both an inherent\ncontradiction \u2013 torture being an extreme assault on individual\nautonomy \u2013 and, given what we know about the practice of torture\nin military, police, and correctional institutions, highly damaging to\nthose liberal democratic institutions. It would be equivalent to a\nliberal democracy legalising and institutionalising slavery on the\ngrounds, say, of economic necessity. Legalised and institutionalised\nslavery is inconsistent with liberal democracy, as is legalised and\ninstitutionalised torture. So if legalised and institutionalised\nslavery and/or legalised and institutionalised torture are necessary\nbecause morally required, then liberal democracy is not possible in\nanything other than an attenuated form. But of course neither\nlegalised/institutionalised slavery nor legalised/institutionalised\ntorture is morally required, quite the contrary. At best, torture is\nmorally justified in some one-off emergencies \u2013 just as murder and\ncannibalism might be morally excusable in a one-off emergency on the\nhigh seas, or desertion from the field of battle might be morally\njustifiable given a one-off emergency back home \u2013 but nothing\nfollows as far as the legalisation/institutionalisation of torture is\nconcerned.\n\nA final point here concerns the proposition that, absent\nlegalised/institutional torture, unlawful endemic torture in\nthe security agencies of contemporary liberal democracies confronting\nterrorism is inevitable. The implication here is that unless\nlegalised, torture will become endemic in these agencies. It has\nalready been argued that legalisation/institutionalisation of torture\nwould be profoundly damaging to liberal democratic institutions.\nAssume this is correct; it does not follow from this that a torture\nculture will not come to exist in those agencies in the context of\ntorture being unlawful. Nor does it follow that an unlawful torture\nculture, indeed an unlawful sub-institution of torture, is inevitable.\nHere there is a tendency to use the kind of argument that is plausible\nin relation to, say, the prohibition of alcohol. It is better to\nlegalise alcohol, because then it can be contained and controlled.\nThis form of argument used in relation to torture is spurious.\nConsuming alcohol to excess is not morally equivalent to torture, and\nwe do not legalise the use of alcohol in emergency situations only.\nLegalising the use of torture in extreme emergencies would be much\nmore akin to legalising perjury in extreme situations. As with\ntorture \u2013 and unlike alcohol \u2013 perjury is only morally\njustified in some extreme one-off\n situations.[19]\n However, no-one is seriously considering legalising perjury in\none-off extreme situations (at least to my knowledge), and with good\nreason \u2013 to do so would strike at the very heart of the legal\nsystem.\n\nThe fact is that the recent history of police, military, and other\norganisations in liberal democracies has demonstrated that torture\ncultures and sub-institutions of torture can be more or less\neliminated, albeit with considerable difficulty. The elimination of\ntorture cultures and sub-institutions can only be achieved if torture\nis unlawful, the community and the political and organisational\nleadership are strongly opposed to it, police officers and other\nrelevant institutional actors are appropriately educated and trained,\nand stringent accountability mechanisms, e.g., video-recording of\ninterviews, close-circuit TV cameras in cells, external oversight\nbodies, are put in place. It is surely obvious that to re-introduce\nand indeed protect the practice of torture, by legalising and\ninstitutionalising it, would be to catapult the security agencies of\nliberal democracies back into the dark ages from whence they came.\n\nThe discussion has focussed on the legalisation and\ninstitutionalisation of torture, where the practice of torture is\nunderstood in general terms; it ought to be now obvious why torture\nshould not be legalised. However, some commentators, notably Alan\nDershowitz, have argued that legalised torture could be justified, if\nthe torture in question was restricted to extreme emergency situations\nand subjected to appropriate accountability mechanisms. Specifically,\nhe has argued for torture warrants of the kind introduced for a time\nin Israel (Dershowitz 2003, 2004; and Wisnewski 2008).\n\nThe notion of torture warrants is supposedly analogous to surveillance\nand telephone interception warrants issued to police by a magistrate\nor other judicial officer. The idea is that privacy is a fundamental\nright but it can be infringed under certain conditions, such as\nreasonable suspicion that the person whose privacy right is to be\ninfringed is engaged in serious criminal activity, there is no\nalternative way to acquire the necessary information to convict\nhim/her, and so on. In this kind of set-up the magistrate, not the\npolice, makes the decision as to whether or not these conditions\nobtain. Consequently, the infringements of privacy rights are\nrestricted, and subject to stringent accountability mechanisms.\n\nHowever, morally speaking, torture warrants are entirely different\nfrom telephone interception or surveillance warrants. First, torture\nis a far greater evil than the infringement of privacy. For one thing,\nhaving one\u2019s phone tapped or movements filmed is inherently much\nless distressing, harmful and morally repugnant than the physical\nsuffering and loss of autonomy involved in being strapped to a chair\nand, say, having someone drill into an unanesthetised tooth. On the\nspectrum of evils, torture is closer to murder/killing than it is to\nthe infringement of privacy. For another thing, torture is a far more\ndangerous practice than infringing privacy. For the degree of the\ninfringement of privacy can be minimised, e.g., the information gained\ncan relatively easily be kept strictly confidential by the police;\nmoreover, there is no inherent reason for the police to illicitly\nwiden a given infringement of privacy by breaching confidentiality.\nBut in practice torture cannot be restricted likewise. The methods of\ntorture and the process of torture exist on a continuum, and there is\noften an inherent reason to \u2018push the envelope\u2019 and\ninflict ever more severe forms of physical suffering on victims;\nso-called \u2018torture lite\u2019 becomes full-blooded, no\nholds-barred torture. One of the consequences of this continuum of\ntorture is the ever-present possibility that the victims of torture\nwill not simply be tortured, but rather be murdered; and in point of\nfact numerous people have died in the course of being tortured.\n\nSecond, as has already been argued, there is an inherent institutional\nreceptivity of military, police, and correctional institutions to the\npractice of torture; a receptivity which is such that torture cultures\nwill grow and flourish, notwithstanding Dershowitz\u2019s proposal\nthat only tightly controlled and highly restricted forms of torture\nare to be legally admissible. This institutional receptivity has the\nconsequence that inevitably large numbers of innocent people will be\ntortured \u2013 as has happened in Israel (see PCATI 2003). Indeed,\neven under tightly controlled and highly restricted forms of torture\nsome innocent persons will inevitably be tortured \u2013 just as the\nprivacy of innocent people is infringed under the existing telephone\nand surveillance warrant systems. Arguably, the infringement of the\nprivacy of some \u2013 in fact, many \u2013 innocent persons is a price\nthat we ought to be willing to pay for the sake of preventing serious\ncrimes. However, it would be preposterous to argue that\n(inadvertently?) torturing numerous innocent people is a reasonable\nprice to pay in return for the information provided by those of the\ntortured who are in fact guilty.\n\nThird, the information gained by wire-tapping or surveillance has in\ngeneral far greater utility than that gained by means of the practice\nof torture \u2013 certainly by the tightly controlled and highly\nrestricted forms of torture of the kind envisaged by Dershowitz.\nIndeed, it is by no means clear that the utility \u2013 in terms of\nsaving lives (and leaving aside the costs) \u2013 of the system of\nlegalised torture warrants will be very high. (In Israel, to repeat\nthe example, it does not appear to have been particularly high.) This\nis so for two reasons. One reason is that torture victims typically\ntell the torturer whatever they think he wants to hear, e.g., they are\nhappy to implicate others who are in fact innocent in order to bring\nan end to their own agony. And even in relation to desired\ncheckable information there is often the problem of knowing\nwhether or not the victim of torture is holding out or does not really\nknow; this is especially the case with hardened terrorists. So by\ncomparison with telephone and surveillance warrants, torture warrants\nare likely to yield unreliable information; there is a serious\nquestion about the quality of much of the information provided under a\nsystem of torture warrants. A further reason to disparage the utility\nof torture warrants is that, again unlike telephone and surveillance\nwarrants, torture warrants are to be issued only in extreme\nemergencies. By contrast, telephone interception and surveillance\nwarrants are issued as a matter of routine, albeit only under certain\n(recurring) conditions. Accordingly, the volume of information capable\nof being provided under a system of torture warrants is extremely\nlimited. In short, over time the torture warrant system is likely only\nto yield an extremely small quantity of reliable information. This\noverall likely lack of utility of the torture warrant system qua\ninstitution is important to keep in mind in the context of a\nprotracted struggle against terrorism involving ongoing loss of life\non both sides. Here the torture warrant system stands in sharp\ncontrast to telephone interception and surveillance warrant systems.\nMoreover, it is precisely because the set of conditions under which it\nis reasonable and effective to infringe privacy rights recurs, that\ninfringements of privacy rights by police can reasonably be legalised\nand institutionalised, e.g., by means of a warrant system. Arguably,\nthe proponents of the torture warrant system have made the mistake of\nproposing a legal/institutional solution to what ought to be regarded\nas a one-off moral\n problem;[20]\n hence the inadequacy of their proposal.\n\nAt any rate, the conclusion must be that any attempt to compare\ntorture warrants to surveillance or interception warrants is entirely\nspurious. Torture is a very different beast.\n\nIn the light of the above three points concerning torture warrants\nthat have just been made in the comparison between these and\nsurveillance and interception warrants, the inevitable conclusion is\nthat the practice of torture could not be contained under a system of\nlegalised torture warrants and the consequences of its not being\ncontained would be horrific. Moreover, as noted above, and argued by\nLuban, Waldron and others, the damage to liberal institutions would be\nincalculable. Finally, the benefits of a system of legalised torture\nwarrants over the longer term are likely to be slight; and certainly\neasily outweighed by the costs. So Dershowitz is entirely misguided in\nhis advocacy of torture warrants. Indeed, as repeatedly mentioned\nabove, we have the example of Israel\u2019s use, or rather abuse, of\nthis system to provide specific empirical evidence against the\nintroduction of torture warrants.\n\nSo torture warrants are highly undesirable, indeed a threat to liberal\ndemocratic institutions. Moreover, torture warrants are unnecessary.\nAs has been argued above, there may well be one-off emergencies in\nwhich the use of torture is morally justifiable. In those cases, the\nrelevant public officials must bite the bullet and do what is morally\nrequired, e.g., torture the terrorist to save thousands of innocent\npeople. In such an emergency, the military or police officers involved\nwill need to break the law on this one occasion. But in itself this is\na small price to pay; and a price the police, the military and the\npoliticians have shown themselves only too willing to pay in\nsituations that are far from emergencies.\n\nOne final matter. What should be done to the military officer, police\nofficer, or other public official who tortures the terrorist\nif \u2013 after saving the city \u2013 their crime is discovered? Quite\nclearly he (or she) should resign or be dismissed from their position;\npublic institutions cannot suffer among their ranks those who commit\nserious crimes. Further, the public official in question must be\ntried, convicted, and sentenced for committing the crime of\n torture.[21]\n Obviously, there are (to say the least) mitigating circumstances, and\nthe sentence should be commuted to, say, one day in prison. Would\npublic officials be prepared to act to save thousands of innocent\nlives, if they knew they might lose their job and/or suffer some minor\npunishment? Presumably many would be prepared to so act in these\ncircumstances.
