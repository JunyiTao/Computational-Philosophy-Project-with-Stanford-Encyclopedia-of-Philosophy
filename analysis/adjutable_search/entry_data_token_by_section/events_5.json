    "main_text": "Types of Events || Static and Dynamic Events\n2.2 Static and Dynamic Events\n\nOne may also want to distinguish between dynamic events, such\nas Anita\u2019s walking, and static events, such as\nAnita\u2019s resting under a tree. According to some authors, the\nlatter are not events proper because they do not involve any change\n(Ducasse 1926). In the most abstract construal, a change is an ordered\npair of states of affairs: an initial state and an end state (von\nWright 1963). More substantial accounts of events as changes describe\nthem as exemplifications of dynamic properties, i.e., properties that\nan object has by virtue of a \u201cmovement\u201d in some quality\nspace (Quinton 1979; Lombard 1979, 1986). However, the question of\nwhether all events should be or involve changes of some sort is\ncontroversial (Montmarquet 1980; Steward 1997; Mellor 1998; Simons\n2003) and it may be argued that it is ultimately a matter of\nstipulation\u2014hence of little metaphysical import (Casati &\nVarzi 2008).\n\nIf static events are admitted, the question arises of whether they\nshould be kept distinct from states (Parsons 1989; Maienborn 2019).\nOne plausible assumption is that the distinction between the static\nand the dynamic aspects of the world is skew to the distinction\nbetween states and activities. As there may be static activities, so\nthere may be dynamic states. Walking is a state of Anita\u2019s that\nis dynamic, as opposed to her state of resting, which is static. The\nwalk itself is an activity of Anita\u2019s that is dynamic, as\nopposed to the rest she took under a tree, which may be considered a\nstatic activity.\n",
