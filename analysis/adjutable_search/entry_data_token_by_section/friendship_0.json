    "main_text": "The Nature of Friendship\n1. The Nature of Friendship\n\nFriendship essentially involves a distinctive kind of concern for your\nfriend, a concern which might reasonably be understood as a kind of\nlove. Nonetheless, it is important not to misconstrue the sort of love\nfriendship involves. Ancient Greek had three words that might\nreasonably be translated as love: agape, eros, and\nphilia. Of these, agape through the Christian\ntradition has come to mean a kind of love that does not respond to the\nantecedent value of its object but instead is thought to create value\nin its object, as with the sort of love God has for us persons as well\nas, by extension, our love for God and our love for humankind in\ngeneral. By contrast, eros and philia have come to\nbe generally understood as responsive to the merits of their\nobjects\u2014to the beloved\u2019s properties, such as his goodness\nor beauty. The difference is that eros is a kind of\npassionate desire for an object, typically sexual in nature, whereas\n\u2018philia\u2019 originally meant a kind of affectionate\nregard or friendly feeling towards not just one\u2019s friends but\nalso possibly towards family members, business partners, and\none\u2019s country at large (Liddell et al., 1940; Cooper, 1977a).\nGiven this classification of kinds of love, philia seems to\nbe that which is most clearly relevant to friendship (though just what\nphilia amounts to needs to be clarified in more detail).\n\nFor this reason, love and friendship often get lumped together as a\nsingle topic; nonetheless, there are significant differences between\nthem. As understood here, love is an evaluative attitude\ndirected at particular persons as such, an attitude which we might\ntake towards someone whether or not that love is reciprocated and\nwhether or not we have an established relationship with\n her.[1]\n Friendship, by contrast, is essentially a kind of\nrelationship grounded in a particular kind of special concern\neach has for the other as the person she is; and whereas we must make\nconceptual room for the idea of unrequited love, unrequited friendship\nis senseless. Consequently, accounts of friendship tend to understand\nit not merely as a case of reciprocal love of some form (together with\nmutual acknowledgment of this love), but as essentially involving\nsignificant interactions between the friends\u2014as being in this\nsense a certain kind of relationship.\n\nNonetheless, questions can be raised about precisely how to\ndistinguish romantic relationships, grounded in eros, from\nrelationships of friendship, grounded in philia, insofar as\neach involves significant interactions between the involved parties\nthat stem from a kind of reciprocal love that is responsive to merit.\nClearly the two differ insofar as romantic love normally has a kind of\nsexual involvement that friendship lacks; yet, as Thomas (1989) asks,\nis that enough to explain the real differences between them? Badhwar\n(2003, 65\u201366) seems to think so, claiming that the sexual\ninvolvement enters into romantic love in part through a passion and\nyearning for physical union, whereas friendship involves instead a\ndesire for a more psychological identification. Yet it is not clear\nexactly how to understand this: precisely what kind of\n\u201cpsychological identification\u201d or intimacy is\ncharacteristic of friendship? (For further discussion, see\n Section 1.2.)\n\nIn philosophical discussions of friendship, it is common to follow\nAristotle (Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII) in distinguishing\nthree kinds of friendship: friendships of pleasure, of utility, and of\nvirtue. Although it is a bit unclear how to understand these\ndistinctions, the basic idea seems to be that pleasure, utility, and\nvirtue are the reasons we have in these various kinds of relationships\nfor loving our friend. That is, I may love my friend because of the\npleasure I get out of her, or because of the ways in which she is\nuseful to me, or because I find her to have a virtuous character.\nGiven the involvement of love in each case, all three kinds of\nfriendship seem to involve a concern for your friend for his sake and\nnot for your own.\n\nThere is an apparent tension here between the idea that friendship\nessentially involves being concerned for your friend for his sake and\nthe idea of pleasure and utility friendships: how can you be concerned\nfor him for his sake if you do that only because of the pleasure or\nutility you get out of it? If you benefit your friend because,\nultimately, of the benefits you receive, it would seem that you do not\nproperly love your friend for his sake, and so your relationship is\nnot fully one of friendship after all. So it looks like pleasure and\nutility friendships are at best deficient modes of friendship; by\ncontrast, virtue friendships, because they are motivated by the\nexcellences of your friend\u2019s character, are genuine,\nnon-deficient friendships. For this reason, most contemporary\naccounts, by focusing their attention on the non-deficient forms of\nfriendship, ignore pleasure and utility\n friendships.[2]\n\nAs mentioned in the first paragraph of this section, philia\nseems to be the kind of concern for other persons that is most\nrelevant to friendship, and the word, \u2018philia,\u2019\nsometimes gets translated as friendship; yet philia is in\nsome ways importantly different from what we ordinarily think of as\nfriendship.\n Thus,\n \u2018philia\u2019 extends not just to friends but also to\nfamily members, business associates, and one\u2019s country at large.\nContemporary accounts of friendship differ on whether family members,\nin particular one\u2019s children before they become adults, can be\nfriends. Most philosophers think not, understanding friendship to be\nessentially a relationship among equals; yet some philosophers (such\nas Friedman 1989; Rorty 1986/1993; Badhwar 1987) explicitly intend\ntheir accounts of friendship to include parent-child relationships,\nperhaps through the influence of the historical notion of\nphilia. Nonetheless, there do seem to be significant\ndifferences between, on the one hand, parental love and the\nrelationships it generates and, on the other hand, the love of\none\u2019s friends and the relationships it generates; the focus here\nwill be on friendship more narrowly construed.\n\nIn philosophical accounts of friendship, several themes recur\nconsistently, although various accounts differ in precisely how they\nspell these out. These themes are: mutual caring (or love), intimacy,\nand shared activity; these will be considered in turn.\n",
