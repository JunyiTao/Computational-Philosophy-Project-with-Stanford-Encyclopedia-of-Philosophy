    "main_text": "The Role(s) of Decoherence in Different Approaches to Quantum Mechanics || Spontaneous collapse theories\n3.3 Spontaneous collapse theories\n\nSpontaneous collapse theories\n seek to modify the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, so that superpositions\nof different \u2018everyday\u2019 states do not arise or are very\nunstable. The best known such theory is the so-called GRW theory\n(Ghirardi Rimini and Weber 1986), in which a material particle\nspontaneously undergoes localisation in the sense that at\nrandom times it experiences a collapse of the form used to describe\napproximate position\n measurements.[29]\n In the original model, the collapse occurs independently for each\nparticle (a large number of particles thus \u2018triggering\u2019\ncollapse much more frequently); in later models the frequency for each\nparticle is weighted by its mass, and the overall frequency for\ncollapse is thus tied to mass\n density.[30]\n\nCan decoherence be put to use in GRW? Such approaches may have\nintuitively little to do with decoherence since they seek to suppress\nprecisely those superpositions that are created by decoherence.\nNevertheless their relation to decoherence is interesting (and, as we\nshall see in the next section, interestingly different from the role\nthat decoherence at least implicitly plays in von Neumann\u2019s\ncollapse postulate).\n\nQualitatively at least, since spontaneous collapse produces\nlocalisation, the effect appears formally similar as in some of the\nmodels of decoherence. But we have \u2018true\u2019 collapse instead\nof suppression of interference, and spontaneous collapse occurs\nwithout there being any interaction between the system and\nanything else. In cases in which the decoherence interaction indeed\nalso takes the form of approximate position measurements, the relation\nbetweeen spontaneous collapse and decoherence presumably boils down to\na quantitative comparison. If collapse happens faster than\ndecoherence, then the superposition of components relevant to\ndecoherence will not have time to arise, and insofar as the collapse\ntheory is successful in recovering classical phenomena, decoherence\nplays no role in this recovery. Instead, if decoherence takes place\nfaster than collapse, then the collapse mechanism can find\n\u2018ready-made\u2019 structures onto which to truly collapse the\nwave function. \n\nNot much explicit work has been done on modelling decoherence in the\nsetting of spontaneous collapse theories, however. Simple comparison\nof the relevant rates in models of decoherence and in spontaneous\ncollapse theories suggests that decoherence is generally faster (Tegmark\n1993, esp. Table 2). The more detailed model by Toro\u0161, Donadi and\nBassi (2016, esp. Section V) indicates that the effect of the collapse\nis amplified through the presence of the environment, i.e. the\ncollapse rate is increased. The situation may be more complex when the\ndecoherence interaction does not approximately privilege position\n(e.g. when instead it selects for currents in a SQUID), because\ncollapse and decoherence might actually \u2018pull\u2019 in\ndifferent\n directions.[31]\n\nA further aspect of the relation between decoherence and spontaneous\ncollapse theories relates to the experimental testability of\nspontaneous collapse theories. Indeed, if we assume that collapse is a\nreal physical process, decoherence will make it extremely difficult in\npractice to detect empirically when and where exactly spontaneous\ncollapse takes place: on the one hand, decoherence makes it look as if\ncollapse has taken place already, while on the other it makes it\ndifficult to perform interference experiments to check whether\ncollapse has not yet taken place. (See the nice discussion of this\nissue in Chapter 5 of Albert (1992)).\n\nEven worse, what might be interpreted as evidence for collapse could\nbe reinterpreted as \u2018mere\u2019 suppression of interference\nwithin an Everett or pilot-wave approach, and only those cases in\nwhich the collapse theory predicts collapse but the system is shielded\nfrom decoherence (or perhaps in which the two pull in different\ndirections) could be used to test collapse theories\nexperimentally.\n\nOne particularly bad scenario for experimental testability is related\nto the speculation (in the context of the \u2018mass density\u2019\nversion) that the cause of spontaneous collapse may be connected with\ngravitation. Tegmark (1993, Table 2) quotes some admittedly uncertain\nestimates for the suppression of interference due to a putative\nquantum gravity, but they are quantitatively very close to the rate of\ndestruction of interference due to the GRW collapse (at least outside\nof the microscopic domain). Similar conclusions are arrived at in the\nmore detailed work by Kay (1998). If there is indeed such a\nquantitative similarity between these possible effects, then it would\nbecome extremely difficult to distinguish between the two. In the\npresence of gravitation, any positive effect could be interpreted as\nsupport for either collapse or decoherence. And in those cases in\nwhich the system is effectively shielded from decoherence (say, if the\nexperiment is performed in free fall), then if the collapse mechanism\nis indeed triggered by gravitational effects, no collapse should be\nexpected\n either.[32]\n",
