    "main_text": "The Domain of Intellectual Property || Protecting Mere Ideas\n2.6 Protecting Mere Ideas\n\nOutside of the regimes of copyright, patent, trade secret, and\ntrademark, there is a substantial set of case law that allows\nindividuals to protect mere ideas as personal property. This system of\nproperty is typically called the \u201claw of ideas\u201d (Nimmer\n1954, Epstein 1992). A highly publicized case in this area is\nBuchwald v. Paramount Pictures (13 U.S.P.Q. 2d 1497 (Cal.\nSuper. Ct. 1990)), concerning the Eddie Murphy movie Coming to\nAmerica. Buchwald approached Paramount Pictures with a movie idea\nand it was agreed that if a movie was made following Buchwald\u2019s\npremise he would receive compensation. Buchwald did not fix his idea,\nfor example by writing it down, and thus copyright infringement did\nnot apply. After several years of false starts and negotiations\nParamount notified Buchwald that the movie based on his idea was not\ngoing to be produced. Shortly after this notification, Coming to\nAmerica was released and credit was given to Eddie Murphy. Even\nthough the movie supposedly lost money, Buchwald sued and received\ncompensation.\n\nThe law of ideas is typically applied in cases where individuals\nproduce ideas and submit them to corporations expecting to be\ncompensated. In certain cases, when these ideas are used by the\ncorporation (or anyone) without authorization, compensation may be\nrequired. Before concluding that an author has property rights to her\nidea(s), courts require the idea(s) to be novel or original\n(Murray v. National Broadcasting, 844 U.S. F2d 988 (Second\nCir. 1988)) and concrete (Hamilton Nat\u2019l Bank v. Belt\n(D.C. Cir. 1953)). Compensation is offered only in cases of\nmisappropriation (Sellers v. American Broadcasting Co. (11th\nCir. 1982)).\n",
