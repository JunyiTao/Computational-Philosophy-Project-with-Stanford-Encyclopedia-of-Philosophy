    "main_text": "Analogical arguments || Analogical inference rules?\n2.4 Analogical inference rules?\n\nSchema (4)\n is a template that represents all analogical arguments, good\nand bad. It is not an inference rule. Despite the confidence with\nwhich particular analogical arguments are advanced, nobody has ever\nformulated an acceptable rule, or set of rules, for valid analogical\ninferences. There is not even a plausible candidate. This situation is\nin marked contrast not only with deductive reasoning, but also with\nelementary forms of inductive reasoning, such as induction by\nenumeration.\n\nOf course, it is difficult to show that no successful analogical\ninference rule will ever be proposed. But consider the following\ncandidate, formulated using the concepts of schema (4) and taking us\nonly a short step beyond that basic characterization.\n\n(5) \n Suppose \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) are the source and target domains.\nSuppose \\(P_1 , \\ldots ,P_n\\) (with \\(n \\ge 1)\\) represents the\npositive analogy, \\(A_1 , \\ldots ,A_r\\) and \\({\\sim}B_1 , \\ldots\n,{\\sim}B_s\\) represent the (possibly vacuous) negative analogy, and\n\\(Q\\) represents the hypothetical analogy. In the absence of reasons\nfor thinking otherwise, infer that \\(Q^*\\) holds in the target domain\nwith degree of support \\(p \\gt 0\\), where \\(p\\) is an increasing\nfunction of \\(n\\) and a decreasing function of \\(r\\) and \\(s\\). \n\n\nRule (5) is modeled on the\n straight rule for enumerative induction\n and inspired by Mill\u2019s view of analogical inference, as\ndescribed in\n \u00a72.3.\n We use the generic phrase \u2018degree of support\u2019 in place of\nprobability, since other factors besides the analogical argument may\ninfluence our probability assignment for \\(Q^*\\).\n\nIt is pretty clear that (5) is a non-starter. The main problem is that\nthe rule justifies too much. The only substantive requirement\nintroduced by (5) is that there be a nonempty positive analogy.\nPlainly, there are analogical arguments that satisfy this condition\nbut establish no prima facie plausibility and no measure of\nsupport for their conclusions.\n\nHere is a simple illustration. Achinstein (1964: 328) observes that\nthere is a formal analogy between swans and line segments if we take\nthe relation \u2018has the same color as\u2019 to correspond to\n\u2018is congruent with\u2019. Both relations are reflexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive. Yet it would be absurd to find positive\nsupport from this analogy for the idea that we are likely to find\ncongruent lines clustered in groups of two or more, just because swans\nof the same color are commonly found in groups. The positive analogy\nis antecedently known to be irrelevant to the hypothetical analogy. In\nsuch a case, the analogical inference should be utterly rejected. Yet\nrule (5) would wrongly assign non-zero degree of support.\n\nTo generalize the difficulty: not every similarity increases the\nprobability of the conclusion and not every difference decreases it.\nSome similarities and differences are known to be (or accepted as\nbeing) utterly irrelevant and should have no influence whatsoever on\nour probability judgments. To be viable, rule (5) would need to be\nsupplemented with considerations of relevance, which depend\nupon the subject matter, historical context and logical details\nparticular to each analogical argument. To search for a simple rule of\nanalogical inference thus appears futile.\n\nCarnap and his followers (Carnap 1980; Kuipers 1988; Niiniluoto 1988;\nMaher 2000; Romeijn 2006) have formulated principles of analogy for\ninductive logic, using Carnapian \\(\\lambda \\gamma\\) rules. Generally,\nthis body of work relates to \u201canalogy by similarity\u201d,\nrather than the type of analogical reasoning discussed here. Romeijn\n(2006) maintains that there is a relation between Carnap\u2019s\nconcept of analogy and analogical prediction. His approach is a hybrid\nof Carnap-style inductive rules and a Bayesian model. Such an approach\nwould need to be generalized to handle the kinds of arguments\ndescribed in\n \u00a72.1.\n It remains unclear that the Carnapian approach can provide a general\nrule for analogical inference.\n\nNorton (2010, and 2018\u2014see Other Internet Resources) has argued\nthat the project of formalizing inductive reasoning in terms of one or\nmore simple formal schemata is doomed. His criticisms seem especially\napt when applied to analogical reasoning. He writes:\n\n\nIf analogical reasoning is required to conform only to a simple formal\nschema, the restriction is too permissive. Inferences are authorized\nthat clearly should not pass muster\u2026 The natural response has\nbeen to develop more elaborate formal templates\u2026 The familiar\ndifficulty is that these embellished schema never seem to be quite\nembellished enough; there always seems to be some part of the analysis\nthat must be handled intuitively without guidance from strict formal\nrules. (2018: 1)\n\n\nNorton takes the point one step further, in keeping with his\n\u201cmaterial theory\u201d of inductive inference. He argues that\nthere is no universal logical principle that \u201cpowers\u201d\nanalogical inference \u201cby asserting that things that share some\nproperties must share others.\u201d Rather, each analogical inference\nis warranted by some local constellation of facts about the target\nsystem that he terms \u201cthe fact of analogy\u201d. These local\nfacts are to be determined and investigated on a case by case\nbasis.\n\nTo embrace a purely formal approach to analogy and to abjure\nformalization entirely are two extremes in a spectrum of strategies.\nThere are intermediate positions. Most recent analyses (both\nphilosophical and computational) have been directed towards\nelucidating criteria and procedures, rather than formal rules, for\nreasoning by analogy. So long as these are not intended to provide a\nuniversal \u2018logic\u2019 of analogy, there is room for such\ncriteria even if one accepts Norton\u2019s basic point. The next\nsection discusses some of these criteria and procedures.\n",
