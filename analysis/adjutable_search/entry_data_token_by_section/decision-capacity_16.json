    "main_text": "Are We Measuring the Right Thing?\n6. Are We Measuring the Right Thing?\n\nAs indicated earlier, there are two slightly different questions\ntheorists might have in mind when they ask: \u201cAre we measuring\nthe right thing?\u201d On the one hand, one might be asking whether a\nparticular instrument developed to help clinicians assess capacity is\nempirically valid. Or (closely related), one might be asking whether a\nparticular empirically valid instrument developed in one context, is\napplicable in a different legal context. On the other hand, one might\nbe asking a deeper question about whether the underlying standards\nwhich inspired the development of the instrument, and which the\ninstrument supposedly tracks, are really themselves adequate. In\nshort, the second question challenges the underlying framework itself,\nasking whether we ought to be considering things that it\nfails to capture. Here, the first sort of question will be considered\nbriefly before turning to the second. \n\nAt this point in time, the most widely used instrument is the MacCAT-T\n(Grisso, Appelbaum, & Hill-Fotouhi 1997). It reflects the most\nwidely influential theory of competence to date, that of Grisso and\nAppelbaum (1998). At the core of this theory are the same four\nabilities mentioned in\n \u00a74\n of this entry: the ability to communicate a choice, the ability to\nunderstand, the ability to appreciate, and the ability to reason.\nHowever, Grisso and Appelbaum (1998) develop detailed specifications\nfor how these four abilities should be interpreted. We shall call the\nview of competence defined in terms of these four abilities as\ninterpreted by Grisso and Appelbaum the \u201cfour-abilities\nmodel\u201d. The MacCAT-T is an instrument designed to help\nclinicians quickly and efficiently assess competence according to the\nfour-abilities model. Thus to ask if the MacCAT-T is empirically valid\nis to ask whether it is good at detecting the presence of the four\nabilities as specified by the model and whether it is good at\nmeasuring the degree to which a patient possesses them. A great deal\nof research has been done on the MacCAT-T, and at this point the\ngeneral consensus appears to be that the MacCAT-T is empirically valid\nin this narrow sense.\n\nA slightly different question is about whether the MacCAT-T can be\napplied in different legal contexts. The legal history in the United\nStates, Canada, and Great Britain has many common roots, and because\nof this many people assume that the same criteria apply in these\ndifferent regions. However, it is not always obvious that this is so.\nIn 2005 The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) was passed in England and Wales\nthat, at least on the surface, seems to embrace different criteria\nfrom the ones listed above. The MCA criteria are (1) understanding,\n(2) retaining, (3) using, and (4) weighing and communicating (see\nMental Capacity Act in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Some researchers have concluded that, for all practical purposes,\nthis is the same model. They take \u201cusing\u201d to cover\nappreciation (since one does not use information one does not fully\naccept) and \u201cweighing\u201d to cover reasoning (which is often\nunderstood as the ability to weigh and compare options). But as of now\nthere is no real consensus. Viewing the two sets of criteria as\nequivalent is, of course, convenient, since then one can make use of\nthe broader English-language literature on capacity assessment without\nworries about whether it strictly applies to one\u2019s own legal\ncontext. For example, based on the assumption that the two models are\nbasically equivalent, some researchers in England have conducted\nempirical studies of capacity in specific populations of patients\nusing the MacCAT-T (Owen, Szmukler, et al. 2009; Owen, Szmukler, et\nal. 2013).\n\nOf course, the MacCAT-T is only one of many instruments that have been\ndeveloped to assess capacity (Etchells et al. 1999; S. Welie 2001;\nVellinga et al. 2004; Dunn et al. 2006; Kim 2010: 61\u201365) and all\nsuch instruments must be assessed for empirical validity, namely the\nextent to which they successfully track and measure the properties\nthey claim to track and measure. However, questions of empirical\nvalidity, though obviously important, are generally of less interest\nto philosophers. The more interesting questions arise when we consider\nthe adequacy of the underlying theory a particular instrument is based\nupon. That means that in the case of the MacCAT-T, the deeper,\ninteresting question is whether the four abilities model as specified\nby Grisso and Appelbaum captures everything important about\ndecision-making capacity. Since to date the four abilities model has\nbeen the most influential model by far, the following discussion\nfocuses on it.\n\nAt the origin of any theory of capacity, there lies a set of paradigm\nexamples around which the theory is built and which it must account\nfor. Thus, in the initial instance, a theory is built around a\nselection of paradigm examples of what capacity and incapacity should\nbe taken to be. The criticisms examined below all appeal to cases that\nthe critics take to be obvious examples of incapacity, but which the\nfour abilities model seems to classify as cases of capacity. Most\ntheorists seem to agree that possessing the four abilities, at least\nto some degree, is necessary for capacity. The primary issue\nis about whether the four abilities are always sufficient or\nwhether there are cases in which something else, some further\nabilities or some further feature of the subject\u2019s choice, might\nbe relevant to the assessment of capacity. The three elements most\ncommonly cited by critics are (1) the subject\u2019s emotions, (2)\nthe subject\u2019s values, and (3) the authenticity of a\nsubject\u2019s choice.\n",
