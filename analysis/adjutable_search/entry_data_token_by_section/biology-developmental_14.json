    "main_text": "Development and Evolution || Normal Stages and Phenotypic Plasticity\n6. Conclusion\n\nThis entry has only sampled a small portion of work relevant to the\nimport and promise of conceptual reflection on the epistemology of\ndevelopmental biology. Much more could be said about each of the above\ndomains, such as a more fine-grained analysis of how normal stages\noperate as types in developmental biology (DiTeresi 2010; Lowe 2016).\nAdditionally, little has been said about how evidence works in\ndevelopmental biological experimentation or differences between\nconfirmatory and exploratory experimentation (Hall 2005;\nO\u2019Malley 2007; Waters 2007b), nor have I treated the role of\nmetaphors and models that characterize key practices in developmental\nbiology (Fagan 2013; Keller 2002). The latter have been perspicuously\nanalyzed via increased attention to the details of particular research\nprograms. Finally, nothing has been said about the metaphysical\nimplications of developmental phenomena (a key input for\n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics).\n Concepts of potentiality are very natural in descriptions of\nembryological phenomena (e.g., the pluripotency of stem cells or the\npotential of a germ layer to yield different kinds of tissue lineages)\nand some have argued that empirical advances in developmental biology\nsupport a new form of essentialism about biological natural kinds\n(Austin 2019). This bears on how we understand dispositions (see the\nentry on\n dispositions)\n because the triggering conditions are often complex and multiply\nrealized (including manifestations without a trigger), as well as the\nfact that cells exhibit dispositions with multiple possible\nmanifestations (cell types) in specific sequential orderings\n(H\u00fcttemann and Kaiser 2018; Laplane 2016). Metaphysical issues\nalso arise in the context of human developmental biology, such as how\nto understand the ontology of pregnancy (Kingma 2018; Sidzinska 2017).\nThus, developmental biology displays not only a rich array of material\nand conceptual practices that can be analyzed to better understand the\nscientific reasoning exhibited in experimental life science, but also\npoints in the direction of new ideas for metaphysics, especially when\nthat endeavor explicitly considers the input of empirically successful\nsciences.\n",
