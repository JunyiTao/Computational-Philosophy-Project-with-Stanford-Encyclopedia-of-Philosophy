    "main_text": "The Solutions Based on the Rejection of the Necessity of the Past\n5. The Solutions Based on the Rejection of the Necessity of the Past\n\nAs argued for instance in (Gabbay et al. 2000, p. 65), the\nPeircean system has some obvious weaknesses, which make the system\nproblematic as a satisfactory candidate for a theory of future\ncontingency. First of all, the system fails to represent many\ncommon-sense notions of time, which are arguably reasonable. This is\ndue to the fact that the idea of a plain future as a \u2018middle\nground\u2019 between possible future and necessary future cannot be\nexpressed in the Peircean system. Suppose I say:\n\n\u201cIt will be sunny in London tomorrow\u201d\n\n\nI do not mean that tomorrow perhaps will be sunny in London,\nor maybe not; I mean that indeed it will be the case; but on the other\nhand I do not mean that there is no other option, or that it must be\nso. One should be aware that in adopting the Peircean system, one\nwould have to consider this everyday intuition illusory \u2014 there\nreally is only the \u201cpossibly\u201d, or the\n\u201cnecessarily\u201d (corresponding to \\(fp\\) and \\(Fp\\)\nmentioned in the (g) and (d) clauses in section 4.2). In fact,\nlogically speaking, in this system \u201cit will be sunny in London\ntomorrow\u201d would have to be considered as equivalent to\neither\n\n\u201cPossibly, it will be sunny in London tomorrow\u201d\n\n\nor\n\n\u201cNecessarily, it will be sunny in London tomorrow\u201d.\n\n\nIn addition, it should be noticed that it is a crucial feature of the\nPericean system that the expressions \\(F(x){\\sim}q\\) and\n\\({\\sim}F(x)q\\) are non-equivalent. This certainly gives rise to a\nserious challenge when confronted with everyday intuition. In fact, it\nis rather difficult to make a clear distinction between the two\nexpressions in terms of natural language. E.g. it is doubtable whether\na distinction between \u201ctomorrow it will not be sunny in\nLondon\u201d and \u201cit is not the case that tomorrow will be\nsunny in London\u201d will be accepted as sufficiently clear.\n\nFor such reasons many scholars have found it rather problematic to\nreject (P5). Instead they have focused on systems accepting (P5) but\nrejecting (P3). In the following we shall consider five such\ntheories.\n",
