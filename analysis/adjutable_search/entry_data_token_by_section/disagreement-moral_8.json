    "main_text": "Epistemological Arguments from Moral Disagreement || Moral Peer Disagreement\n4.1 Moral Peer Disagreement\n\n\nOne example of an argument which invokes a specific view is developed\nby Sarah McGrath (2008). The view in question entails that your belief\nabout some topic does not amount to knowledge if it is \u201cdenied by\nanother person of whom it is true that: you have no more reason to\nthink that he or she is in error than you are\u201d. Armed with this\nprinciple, McGrath offers an argument to the effect that many of our\nmoral beliefs do not constitute knowledge. What she in particular has\nin mind are those beliefs that concern issues \u201cthat tend to be\nhotly contested in the applied ethics literature as well as in the\nbroader culture\u201d (92\u201393), such as the ones about the death\npenalty and meat-eating. (Derek Parfit considers a challenge which he\narticulates similarly. See 2011, 546.)\n\n\nMcGrath\u2019s principle is congenial with the position known as\n\u201cconciliationism\u201d in the peer disagreement debate, although\nthat position is more often stated in terms of justified or rational\nbelief than knowledge (see Frances 2019 for an overview of the\npositions and arguments the debate revolves around). An interlocutor is\nyour peer, roughly, if he or she is just as well equipped as you are\n(for example, in terms of evidence and reasoning skills) when it comes\nto figuring out the truth about topics of the kind the contested belief\nconcerns. According to conciliationism, if one learns that one\u2019s\nbeliefs are opposed by a peer, then one should drop the beliefs or at\nleast reduce one\u2019s confidence in them. Conciliationism thus\noffers a way to argue that moral disagreement sometimes has the type of\nsignificance assigned to it by moral skeptics (see Rowland 2020 for an\nextensive discussion of the strategy).\n\n\nConciliationism has been met with criticism from theorists who\ninstead favor \u201csteadfastness\u201d in the face of peer\ndisagreement. And the fact that conciliationism is thus a contested\ndoctrine also raises the self-defeat worry that it can be turned\nagainst itself as it may then seem to call for its own abandonment. But\nan advantage of conciliationism in the present context is that it\nallows moral skeptics to derive skeptical conclusions from moral\ndisagreement without having to assume that the parties are in ideal\ncircumstances. After all, two persons could be in equally favorable\nepistemic situations even if their situations could be improved. At the\nsame time, however, the conclusions a skeptic may, via\nconciliationism, hope to derive from such disagreements are\ncorrespondingly modest. They seem at best to entail that the parties\ncurrently lack justified beliefs or knowledge and do not rule out that\nknowledge is in principle attainable. As Richard Feldman puts it, the\nskepticism we get from conciliationism is \u201ca kind of contingent\nreal-world skepticism\u201d which does not address, for example,\n\u201cwhether it is possible for us to know about the existence and\nnature of things in the external world\u201d (2006, 217).\n\n\nThe type of skepticism which follows from conciliationism is likely\nto be limited in the scope sense as well. The reason is that, besides\nthe disputes about the death penalty, abortion, and so on, there are\nalso issues over which disagreement is rare, such as, to use a couple\nof examples which are often mentioned in this context (e.g., in Vavova\n2014), whether pain is bad and whether parents have a responsibility to\ntake care of their children. A global moral skeptic might try to\ncounter that point by noting that those claims are also opposed by some\npeople, namely error theorists such as Mackie, who reject all\n(positive) moral claims as being incorrect in one fell sweep. But even\nif that group includes some very capable thinkers, they are vastly\noutnumbered by others, including philosophers who appear no less\ncompetent. As McGrath suggests, the fact that the error theorists thus\nare outliers might in itself be seen as a reason for not regarding them\nas peers, in spite of their philosophical capabilities (2008, 95). (For\na different argument to the effect that conciliationism yields at most\na very restricted form of skepticism, see Vavova 2014.)\n",
