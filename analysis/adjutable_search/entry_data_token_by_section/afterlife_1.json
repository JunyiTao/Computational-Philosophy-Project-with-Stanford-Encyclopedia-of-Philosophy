    "main_text": "The Possibility of Survival\u2014Dualism\n2. The Possibility of Survival\u2014Dualism\n\nAt first, it seems obvious that dualism is a\n\u201csurvival-friendly\u201d perspective. If we are nothing more\nthan our bodies, it seems that if death destroys our bodies, we are\ndestroyed and there is nothing left of us as persons\u2014though\nparts of our bodies and the particles that make it up will be\nscattered and perhaps (temporarily) come to be part of the bodies of\nother living organisms. If, however, we are nonphysical (or\nimmaterial) minds or souls or persons who are embodied, then even the\ncomplete annihilation of our physical bodies does not entail our\nannihilation as persons. In fact, one of several arguments for dualism\nis based on the conceivability of our existing without our bodies. If\ndualism is true, however, it does not necessarily follow that persons\nwill survive the death of their bodies. It may be that the functional\ndependence of ourselves on our bodies is so essential that we only\ncome into existence as embodied persons when our bodies reach a\ncertain formation and constitution and then we cease to be when that\nformation and constitution is destroyed. But dualism at least opens\nthe door for claiming that our dependence on our bodies is contingent\n(not necessary) or is essential only given the present laws of nature\n(laws that may be violated by God). Dualist accounts of survival have\nbeen seriously questioned, however. \n\nSome philosophers argue that dualist accounts of survival fail because\nwe have no \u201ccriteria of identity\u201d for disembodied persons.\nWhen we make judgments about the identity of persons we are not making\njudgments about the identity of souls. It has been argued that we\ncannot make judgments about the identity of souls, because souls are\nsaid to be imperceptible and non-spatial. And because of this, the\nidentity of a person over time cannot consist of the identity of the\nperson\u2019s soul over time. What we are able to identify\u2014and\nre-identify\u2014is a person\u2019s body. But once the person has\ndied that body decomposes in a grave, and can\u2019t be the basis for\nour identification of the person who is supposed to have survived\ndisembodied (Perry 1978: 6\u201318).\n\nHasker claims that this objection is confused, conflating two quite\ndistinct questions (Hasker 1989:208\u201309). One is a metaphysical\nquestion: What does it mean to say of a person at one time\nthat she is numerically the same person at a later time? (Or, if you\nlike, it is a metaphysical question to ask: Is x at\nt1 the same \u03c6 as y at\nt2?) The second is an epistemological question:\nHow can we tell that a person at one time is numerically the\nsame person at a later time? (Or how can we tell that x at\nt1 is the same \u03c6 as y at\nt2?) The failure to distinguish these questions (a\nfailure which may be due in part to Wittgenstein) is the source of\nserious philosophical confusions. The short answer to the first\nquestion is that normally, when we know what a \u03c6 is, we know also\nwhat it is for a \u03c6 at t1 to be the same\nindividual \u03c6 as a \u03c6 at t2. The abnormal\ncases are those in which the \u03c6 at t1 has\nundergone changes, and we are unsure whether those changes amount to\nthe destruction of the \u03c6, or its replacement by another object, so\nthat the very same \u03c6 cannot possibly have persisted until\nt2. The classic example is the ship of\n Theseus,[1]\n but there are many others. In such cases, our first recourse is to\nseek to understand more accurately the concept of a \u03c6\u2014does\nour concept of a ship, for example, allow for the progressive\nreplacement of all of the ship\u2019s parts, or not? But\nsometimes there may be no determinate answer to this question. Our\nconcepts, after all, have been developed to deal with the sorts of\ncontingencies that normally arise, and it may sometimes be possible to\ninvent scenarios (or even to discover them empirically) that are not\nprovided for in our ordinary usage of a concept. In that case, we must\neither provide for ourselves criteria to cover the novel situation\n(thus modifying our previous concept of a \u03c6), or else admit that\nthe question we were asking has no answer.\n\nWhen we pose this question with regard to the persistence of\nimmaterial souls, what we find is that there is no problem that needs\na solution. We know what it is to be a subject of experience\u2014to\nbe a being that thinks, and believes, and desires various things, for\nexample\u2014and prima facie at least this does not entail\nbeing embodied, let alone being embodied in the very same body over\ntime. If we think of the immaterial soul in Cartesian terms, there\nsimply isn\u2019t anything that can happen to such a soul (barring\nits being no longer sustained in existence by God) that could bring it\nabout that the soul ceases to be; Cartesian souls are \u201cnaturally\nimmortal\u201d. Some other dualist views may not opt for natural\nimmortality of the soul, and if so they will need to say something\nabout the sorts of changes that a soul can and cannot sustain if it is\nto remain in existence as the individual it was. But there is no\nproblem here for the general hypothesis of survival as an immaterial\nsoul (Hasker 1999: 206\u201311).\n\nThe metaphysical question having been disposed of, it becomes apparent\nthat the epistemological question is less significant than it may\nappear to be at first. How do we re-identify immaterial souls over\ntime? Under normal circumstances, we do this by re-identifying the\nembodiment of the soul, but this is not always possible: prior at\nleast to the advent of DNA testing, cases of disputed identity could\nnot always be settled by re-identifying bodies. Sometimes the\nsubject\u2019s memory of events is an important clue, though not of\ncourse an infallible one. But can any tests establish the identity of\na completely non-embodied subject? Evidently, the question of the\nidentity of a non-embodied subject makes sense to some: those who\nconsult spiritualist mediums certainly understand the question,\nwhether they\u2019re conversing with dear departed Aunt Susie, or\nmerely with a manipulative practitioner. But again, once it is seen\nthat there is no metaphysical problem here, the epistemological\nquestion becomes purely a practical one, requiring to be answered if\nand when we have the need in practice to make such\nidentifications.\n\nIt is also worth noting that an objection against individual\ncontinuity in dualism can be deployed against individual continuity in\nmaterialism. One objection (that can be traced back to Kant) against\ndualism is that the dualist is unable to account for the possibility\nthat the soul or immaterial self is constantly being replaced by\ndifferent individual selves, (with complete updated\n\u201cmemories\u201d and psychological qualities) thus creating the\nillusion of personal continuity of the self-same subject. If\nthe self is immaterial, how would we notice the successive changes?\nThis may be called the problem of undetected (and perhaps\nundetectable) soul-switching. This objection faces many obstacles, one\nbeing that we would be unable to properly account for our experience\nof successive states (we hear Big Ben ring three times by first\nhearing it ring twice) if we are not the self-same individuals over\ntime. But more to the point, in terms of continuity, it is logically\npossible that material bodies are switched every nanosecond. If the\nswitch (or annihilation and creation) were done in an instant (as\nopposed to an interval) there would be no duration, no event that\ncould be measured by us that would reveal the switch. If undetectable\nmaterial object-switching is not a problem, then undetectable\nsoul-switching should not be a problem.\n\nThere may still be an objection to a dualist account of an afterlife\nwhich holds that the idea of disembodied survival, even if not\nlogically incoherent, is one we don\u2019t have a sufficient grasp of\nto allow it to count as a real possibility. What would such survival\namount to, anyway? Of course, if the souls of the departed are assumed\nto be fitted out immediately with resurrection bodies, this difficulty\nis greatly alleviated. But if the notion of an immaterial soul is to\ndo any philosophical work, we need to be able to think what it might\nbe like for such a soul to exist on its own, disembodied.\n\nThis challenge has been met in an interesting article by H.H. Price\n(1953). Price spells out, in considerable detail, a notion of\ndisembodied souls existing in a \u201cworld\u201d of something like\ndream-images\u2014images, however, that would be shared between a\nnumber of more or less like-minded, and telepathically interacting,\nsouls. Included among these images would be images of one\u2019s own\nbody and of other people\u2019s bodies, so that one might, at first,\nfind it difficult to distinguish the image-world from the ordinary\nphysical world we presently inhabit. The conception is similar to\nBerkeley\u2019s, except that Price does not invoke God directly as\nthe sustainer of regularities in the image-world. He does say,\nhowever, that \n\n\nif we are theists, we shall hold that the laws of nature, in other\nworlds as in this one, are in the end dependent on the will of a\nDivine Creator. (1953: 390) \n\n\nSomeone who seriously considers Price\u2019s development of this idea\nwill be forced to admit that a sufficiently clear account of what\ndisembodied existence might be like has been proposed. (And for a more\nrecent work that argues that our actual world is idealist in the\ntradition of Berkeley, see Foster 2007.) We need not follow Price (or\nFoster) in (what appears to be) his supposition that this is a\nplausible account of the actual state of persons who have died. It is\nenough if he has provided an account that makes plain the\nintelligibility of the notion of disembodied survival; the believer in\nan afterlife can then say, \u201cIf not in just this way, then in\nsome other\u201d.\n\nIf there is reason to think that mind-body dualism is true, then there\nis reason to think that a person\u2019s survival of death is\nlogically possible. But dualism has come upon hard times lately, and\nis widely regarded as being discredited. Whether or not this is\nwarranted, dualism is undoubtedly subject to a number of objections,\nthough these are not necessarily more severe than the difficulties\nthat attend materialism (see the entry on\n dualism,\n also Koons and Bealer (eds.) 2010). For a positive case for dualism,\nsee Loose, Menuge, & Moreland 2018 (The Blackwell Companion to\nSubstance Dualism). In view of this let us consider also the\npossibility of survival given some form of\n materialism.[2]\n",
