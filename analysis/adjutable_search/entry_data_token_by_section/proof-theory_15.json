Epilogue \n\nProof theory has become a large subject with many specialized branches\nthat can be mathematically quite complex. So we have tried to present\ndevelopments close to the main artery of its body, starting with its\ninception at the beginning of the twentieth century and ending with\nresults from the close of the century. The theorems mentioned at the\nend of section 5 foreshadow investigations in the twenty-first century\nthat are presented in Rathjen (2018) and concern relationships\nbetween Feferman\u2019s systems of explicit mathematics and\nMartin-L\u00f6f type theories; the paper touches also on the\ncompletely new developments of homotopy type theory (see Awodey 2012).\nSome additional contemporary proof theoretic developments are\ndescribed in appendices\n D,\n E and\n F.\n The theme of\n Appendix E,\n the extraction of computational information from proofs in particular\nformal theories, is the central topic of Schwichtenberg and\nWainer\u2019s 2012. They deal with theories of arithmetic and\nanalysis up to \\((\\Pi^1_1{\\Hy}\\bCA)_0\\). Standard texts on proof\ntheory covering ordinal analysis are Takeuti 1985 and Sch\u00fctte\n1977. First steps into ordinal analysis are taken in Pohlers 2009.\nFinally, some new directions of proof theoretic work are taken in\ncontributions to both Kahle and Rathjen 2015 and J\u00e4ger and\nSieg 2018.\n\nLet us also report on progress on the methodological issues the\nfinitist consistency program was to address. First of all, due to\nquite a bit of important historical work, we have a much better grasp\nof the evolution of the program in the 1920s and its roots in the\ndevelopment toward modern structuralist mathematics in the nineteenth\ncentury. The work of editing Hilbert\u2019s unpublished lecture notes\nhas opened a treasure of\n information.[32]\n The connections to the development in nineteenth century mathematics\nare hinted at in\n Appendix A,\n but they are explored in greater depth, for example, in\nFerreir\u00f3s 2008; Reck 2003, 2013; and the papers Sieg wrote on\nDedekind with Morris (forthcoming) and Schlimm (2005, 2017),\nrespectively. Secondly, as to the properly methodological issues, we\npresented some broad considerations in\n section 4.1,\n namely, that consistency proofs should be given relative to\n\u201cconstructive\u201d theories. We did not make any remarks about\nwhat is characteristic of a constructive perspective and why such a\nperspective has not only a mathematical, but also a philosophical\npoint. There is, of course, a very rich literature. Let us point to\nsome informative sources: van Atten (2007) as defending\nBrouwer\u2019s views, Martin-L\u00f6f (1984) as exposing the\nphilosophical motivation for his type theory, Feferman (1988, 2000)\ndiscussing the foundational point of proof theory, Bernays (1976) as\npresenting crucial aspects of an informed philosophy of mathematics,\nand (Sieg 2013) as\nexplicating (the context for) his reductive\nstructuralism.\n\nBack to proof theory: We have to admit that we neglected some\nclassical topics. One is the study of different proof systems and\ntheir relationships going back to Gentzen\u2019s dissertation (1935).\nIn their Basic Proof Theory, Troelstra and Schwichtenberg\n(2000) give an excellent selection, but some important calculi such as\nthe Sch\u00fctte proof systems are not covered (see, for example,\nSch\u00fctte 1960b, 1977). They also do not cover proof systems for\ntemporal and modal logic, neither are substructural logics\n presented.[33]\n\n\nA second omission concerns Bounded Arithmetic, where feasibility\nissues are a central focus: one studies formal theories with provably\nrecursive functions that form very small subclasses of the primitive\nrecursive ones. Indeed, the class of the provably total functions of\nBuss\u2019 base theory is that of functions that can be computed in\npolynomial time, and there was the hope that proof theoretic\ninvestigations might contribute novel results in complexity theory. A\nthird omission concerns proof mining; that line of deep mathematical\ninvestigations using proof theoretic tools was initiated by Kreisel\n(1958, 1982) and Luckhardt (1989), but really perfected only by Kohlenbach\n(2007). We hinted at the work of his school at the very end of\n section 4.1.\n\nProof theory, as we described it, deals primarily with formal proofs\nor derivations. Hilbert aimed, however, as we pointed out in\n section 1,\n for a more general analysis of ordinary, informal mathematical\nproofs. For Gentzen in his 1936, \u201cthe objects of proof theory\nshall be the proofs carried out in mathematics proper\u201d (p. 499). The aim of Hilbert and his\ncollaborators was undoubtedly to achieve a deeper mathematical and\nconceptual understanding, but also to find general methods of proof\nconstruction in formal calculi. This is now being pursued in the very\nactive area of using powerful computers for the interactive\nverification of proofs and programs as well as the fully automated\nsearch for proofs of mathematical\n theorems.[34]\n That can be pursued with a cognitive scientific purpose of modeling\nmathematical reasoning (see Sieg 2010 and Ganesalingam & Gowers 2017). It is clearly\nin the spirit of Hilbert who articulated matters in his second Hamburg\ntalk of 1927 as follows:\n\n\nThe formula game \u2026 has, besides its mathematical value, an\nimportant general philosophical significance. For this formula game is\ncarried out according to certain definite rules, in which the\ntechnique of our thinking is expressed. These rules form a closed\nsystem that can be discovered and definitively stated.\n\n\nThen he continues with a provocative statement about the cognitive\ngoal of proof theoretic investigations.\n\n\nThe fundamental idea of my proof theory is none other than to describe\nthe activity of our understanding, to make a protocol of the rules\naccording to which our thinking actually proceeds. (Hilbert 1927\n[1967: 475]) \n\n\nIt is clear to us, and it was clear to Hilbert, that mathematical\nthinking does not proceed in the strictly regimented ways imposed by\nan austere formal theory. Though formal rigor is crucial, it is not\nsufficient to shape proofs intelligibly or to discover them\nefficiently, even in pure logic. Recalling the principle that\nmathematics should solve problems \u201cby a minimum of blind\ncalculation and a maximum of guiding thought\u201d, we have to\ninvestigate the subtle interaction between understanding and\nreasoning, i.e., between introducing concepts and proving\ntheorems.\n",
