    "main_text": "The transcendental deduction || The law-giver of nature\n4.3 The law-giver of nature\n\nThe final condition of self-consciousness that Kant adds to the\npreceding conditions is that our understanding must cooperate with\nsensibility to construct one, unbounded, and unified space-time to\nwhich all of our representations may be related. \n\nTo see why this further condition is required, consider that so far we\nhave seen why Kant holds that we must represent an objective world in\norder to be self-conscious, but we could represent an objective world\neven if it were not possible to relate all of our representations to\nthis objective world. For all that has been said so far, we might\nstill have unruly representations that we cannot relate in any way to\nthe objective framework of our experience. On Kant\u2019s view, this\nwould be a problem because, as we have seen, he holds that\nself-consciousness involves universality and necessity: according to\nhis principle of apperception, \u201cthe I think must be\nable to accompany all my representations\u201d (B131). Yet if, on\nthe one hand, I had representations that I could not relate in some\nway to an objective world, then I could not accompany those\nrepresentations with \u201cI think\u201d or recognize them as my\nrepresentations, because I can say \u201cI think\u2026\u201d about\nany given representation only by relating it to an objective world,\naccording to the argument just discussed. So I must be able to relate\nany given representation to an objective world in order for it to\ncount as mine. On the other hand, self-consciousness would also be\nimpossible if I represented multiple objective worlds, even if I could\nrelate all of my representations to some objective world or other. In\nthat case, I could not become conscious of an identical self that has,\nsay, representation 1 in space-time A and representation 2 in\nspace-time B. It may be possible to imagine disjointed spaces and\ntimes, but it is not possible to represent them as objectively real.\nSo self-consciousness requires that I can relate all of my\nrepresentations to a single objective world.\n\nThe reason why I must represent this one objective world by means of a\nunified and unbounded space-time is that, as Kant argued in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, space and time are the pure forms of human\nintuition. If we had different forms of intuition, then our experience\nwould still have to constitute a unified whole in order for us to be\nself-conscious, but this would not be a spatio-temporal whole. Given\nthat space and time are our forms of intuition, however, our\nunderstanding must still cooperate with sensibility to construct a\nspatio-temporal whole of experience because, once again, \u201cwe can\nrepresent nothing as combined in the object without having previously\ncombined it ourselves,\u201d and \u201call combination [\u2026] is\nan action of the understanding\u201d (B130). So Kant distinguishes\nbetween space and time as pure forms of intuition, which belong solely\nto sensibility; and the formal intuitions of space and time (or\nspace-time), which are unified by the understanding (B160\u2013161).\nThese formal intuitions are the spatio-temporal whole within which our\nunderstanding constructs experience in accordance with the\n categories.[18]\n\nThe most important implication of Kant\u2019s claim that the\nunderstanding constructs a single whole of experience to which all of\nour representations can be related is that, since he defines nature\n\u201cregarded materially\u201d as \u201cthe sum total of all\nappearances\u201d and he has argued that the categories are\nobjectively valid of all possible appearances, on his view it follows\nthat our categories are the source of the fundamental laws of nature\n\u201cregarded formally\u201d (B163, 165). So Kant concludes on this\nbasis that the understanding is the true law-giver of nature. In his\nwords: \u201call appearances in nature, as far as their combination\nis concerned, stand under the categories, on which nature (considered\nmerely as nature in general) depends, as the original ground of its\nnecessary lawfulness (as nature regarded formally)\u201d (B165). Or\nmore strongly: \u201cwe ourselves bring into the appearances that\norder and regularity that we call nature, and moreover we would\nnot be able to find it there if we, or the nature of our mind, had not\noriginally put it there. [\u2026] The understanding is thus not\nmerely a faculty for making rules through the comparison of the\nappearances: it is itself the legislation for nature, i.e., without\nunderstanding there would not be any nature at all\u201d\n(A125\u2013126). \n",
