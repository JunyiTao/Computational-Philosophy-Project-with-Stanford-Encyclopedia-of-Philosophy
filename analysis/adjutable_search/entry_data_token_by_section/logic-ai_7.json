Towards a Formalization of Common Sense\n\nJohn McCarthy\u2019s explicit long-term goal\u2014the\nformalization of common sense knowledge\u2014has been adopted and\npursued by a relatively small, but active, subcommunity of AI\nresearchers.  A larger group (those involved in knowledge\nrepresentation, cognitive robotics, and qualitative physics) can be\nconsidered to work on specialized projects that support the larger\ngoal.  Anything like a formalization of common sense is so far from\nbeing accomplished that\u2014if it is achievable at all\u2014it is\nnot even possible to estimate when we could expect the task to be\ncompleted.  However, since 2001 (the date of a symposium on common\nsense reasoning held at The Courant Institute\u2014see\n The Common Sense 2001 Homepage) something like\na cooperative, sustained effort in this direction has begun to\nemerge.  This effort is yielding a better sense of how to develop a\nworkable methodology for formalizing common sense, and of how to\ndivide the larger problem up into more manageable parts.  Many of the\npapers presented at this conference were presented in expanded form\nin 2004 in an issue of Artificial Intelligence.  The\nintroduction to this issue, \nDavis & Morgenstern 2004, provides a useful survey and\nappreciation of the general research area.\n\t\n\nThis cooperative formalization effort (1) seeks to account for\nmany areas of knowledge, and at the same time (2) attempts to see how\nthis formalized knowledge can be brought to bear on moderately\ncomplex common-sense reasoning problems.  The first book-length\ntreatment of this topic, Davis 1991,\ndivides the general problem into the following subtopics.\n\n Quantities and Measurements\n Time\n Space\n Physics\n Minds\n Plans and Goals\n Society\n\n\n\nSeveral of these topics overlap with concerns of the\nqualitative physics and qualitative reasoning community.  Although it\ncan be hard to tell where common sense ends and physics begins, the\nformalization of common sense reasoning can be seen as a more general\nformalization project that can draw on a tradition in qualitative\nphysics that has gone through many years of development and by now is\nfairly \n mature.[39]\n\n\n And a few of them overlap with\nthe work on the formalization of planning that was described above in\nSection 4.  Minds and society, however, are new and\ndifferent topics; the former has to do with common sense psychology\nand its application in introspective and interpersonal reasoning, and\nthe latter, of course, should have to do with social and political\nknowledge and reasoning, but this is the least-developed area of\nformalized common sense knowledge: the chapter on this topic in Davis 1991 is very brief, and discusses\nmutual attitudes and communication.  More recently, Andrew S. Gordon\nand Jerry Hobbs have undertaken a large-scale, ambitious\nformalization of common-sense psychology.  See, for instance, \n Hobbs & Gordon 2005. \n\n\nA more recent book-length treatment of the formalization of\ncommon sense, \n Mueller, 2006, follows a similar\npattern.  More than half of the book is devoted to reasoning about\nactions and change.  There are short chapters on space and mental\nstates, and a longer treatment of default reasoning.  Although\nlogical techniques and formalization methods take center stage in\nthis book, it also contains material on nonlogical methods and\non implementations related to the  formalizations.\n\nEven when attempted on a moderate scale, the formalization of\ncommon sense knowledge puts considerable pressure on the resources of\neven the most powerful logical systems that were devised for the\nformalization of mathematics.  As we tried to show in discussing the\nspecial case of action and planning in Section 4,\nthis pressure may lead us to seek logics that can facilitate the\nformalization projects: for instance, nonmonotomic logics and logics\nthat explicitly represent context.  \n\t\n\nWhen larger-scale formalizations are attempted, other\nchallenges arise that are similar to those that software engineering\ntries to address.  Even fairly small programs and systems of axioms\nare difficult to comprehend and can be highly unpredicable, yielding\nunexpected consequences and unanticipated interactions.  The creation\nand use of larger programs and formalizations raises questions of how\nto enable teams of developers to produce coherent results when\nmodules are integrated, how to maintain and test large systems, and\nhow to use knowledge sources such as dictionaries and knowledge bases\nto automatically generate axioms.  \n\nYou can think of the philosophical methodology of providing\nanalyses as a collection of attempts to formalize or partially\nformalize various common sense notions.  These attempts are far\nsmaller in scale, less systematic, and more heterogeneous than the\nparallel effort that is emerging in AI.  Philosophers have never\nchosen a specific domain comparable to the planning domain and\nmounted a sustained attempt to formalize it, along with a companion\neffort to develop appropriate logics.  And no matter how complex the\nnotions with which they which they are concerned, philosophers have\nnever allowed their analyses to grow to the complexity where \nmethodological issues arise similar to those that apply to the\ndevelopment and maintenance of large software systems. \n\nThe techniques emerging in AI are of great potential\nsignificance for philosophy because it is easy to suspect that many\nphilosophically important phenomena have the sort of complexity that\ncan only be dealt with by accepting the problems that go along with\ndeveloping complex formalizations.  Limitations of the philosophical\nmethods that were used throughout the twentieth century and are still\nin use may make it impossible to produce theories that do justice to\nthe subject matter.  \n\nIt would therefore be a great mistake for philosophers to\ndisparage and ignore the large-scale formalizations that are\nbeginning to emerge in AI because these efforts begin to raise\nengineering issues.  It may well be that, although philosophy\nrequires us to address complex phenomena in a rigorous way, the\ntraditional philosophical methods are capable of doing justice\nto the complexity.  Methods that promise to do this are worth taking\nseriously.\n\nAmong other methods borrowed from computer science, \nthe common sense reasoning community has sought to develop \nsuites of \u201cbenchmark problems\u201d.  The idea is to publicize\nproblems that are difficult but not impossibly difficult, to\nencourage the community to create solutions, and compare\nthe solutions.\n\n\nProbably the best-studied problem to date is Ernest Davis\u2019\n\u201cegg-cracking problem.\u201d  This is formulated as follows on the\nCommon Sense Reasoning Problem webpage.\n\n\n  A cook is cracking a raw egg against a glass bowl.  Properly \n  performed, the impact of the egg against the edge of the bowl will\n  crack the eggshell in half.  Holding the egg over the bowl, the cook\n  will separate the two halves of the shell with his fingers, enlarging\n  the crack, and the contents of the egg will fall gently into the bowl.\n  The end result is that the entire contents of the egg will be in the\n  bowl, with the egg unbroken, and that the two halves of the shell are\n  in the cook\u2019s fingers.\n \n\nVariants:  What happens if: The cook brings the egg to impact\n  very quickly?  Very slowly?  The cook lays the egg in the bowl and\n  exerts steady pressure with his hand?  The cook, having cracked the\n  egg, attempts to peel it off its contents like a hard-boiled egg?\n  The bowl is made of looseleaf paper?  Of soft clay?  The bowl is smaller\n  than the egg?  The bowl is upside down?  The cook tries this\n  procedure with a hard-boiled egg?  With a coconut?  With an\n  M&M? [40]\n\n\nAlong with the problem itself  three solutions are posted:\n Shanahan 2004, \n Lifschitz 1998b,\n and a version of\n  Morgenstern 2001.  Comparing the\nsolutions is instructive: similarities outweigh differences.  All the\nauthors think of this as a planning problem, and use a versions of\nthe Situation Calculus or the Event Calculus in the formalization.\nEach axiomatization is modular, with, for instance, separate modules\ndevoted to the relevant geometrical and material properties.  Each\nauthor provides a \u201cproof of concept\u201d for the formalization by showing\nthat the axioms support a proof of the correctness of a plan to crack\nthe egg in the simple case.  None of the authors considers all of\nDavis\u2019 elaborations of the problem, but the axioms are framed with\nelaboration in mind and some elaborations are considered.  It isn\u2019t\nclear whether any of the authors actually implemented the\nformalization (for instance, using a theorem prover). \n\nThe egg-cracking case raises the problem of how to evaluate\nmoderately large formalizations of common sense problems.\nMorgenstern and Shanahan express this issue explicitly.  Morgenstern\nsuggests that the important criteria are (1) Epistemological adequacy\n(correspondence to intuitive reasoning, as experienced by people who\nengage in it), (2) Faithfulness to the real world, (3) Reusability,\nand (4) Elaboration tolerance.  It isn\u2019t clear whether the first two\nof these criteria are too subjective to be useful.  To these,\nShanahan adds (5) Usability, which probably is presupposed by\nMorgenstern\u2019s third criterion.\n\n\nThere is anecdotal evidence that the larger AI community is\nsomewhat skeptical about such research projects\u2014or, if not\nskeptical, at least puzzled about how to evaluate them.  In\nconsidering these doubts, it is necessary to appreciate the\ncomplexity of these formalization problems, and the preliminary and\ntentative status of the research program.  Nevertheless, this\ncriticism has some legitimacy, the common sense reasoning community\nis sensitive to these criticisms, and is working to develop and\nrefine the methods and criteria for evaluating this work.\n\nAs long as formalization problems remain relatively simple,\nwe can treat formalization as an art rather than as a discipline with\na well-articulated methodology.  But the trends we\u2019ve been\ndiscussing show that formalization of even moderate-sized realistic\ncommon sense reasoning problems is not merely an art.  Just as\nprogramming systems, expert systems and knowledge bases have created\ncorresponding software engineering disciplines, large-scale\nformalization projects require a carefully thought through and tested\nmethodology.\n\n9. Logical Approaches to Natural Language and \nCommunication\n\n\nOver the last twenty-five years or so, many profound relations have\nemerged between logic and grammar. Computational linguistics (or\nnatural language processing) is a branch of AI, and it is fairly\nnatural to classify some of these developments under logic and AI. But\nmany of them also belong to an independent tradition in logical\nfoundations of linguistics; and in many cases it is hard (and\npointless) to attempt a classification. This sketch will concentrate on\ndevelopments that have to do with reasoning about linguistics; other\napplications of logic to linguistics are described in\n van Benthem & ter Meulen 1996.\n9.1 Parsing and Deduction\n\n\nGrammar formalisms\u2014special-purpose systems for the description\nof linguistic systems and subsystems\u2014can be thought of as logics\ndesigned to axiomatize the association of linguistic structures with\nstrings of symbols. You might be able to infer from such a system, for\ninstance, that \u2018assignments\u2019 is the plural form of the\nnominalization of the verb \u2018assign\u2019. So you can look at the\nprocess of parsing a string of words\u2014of finding the\nlinguistic structures, if any, that are associated with it\u2014as a\nsearch for a proof in a certain logical system.\n\n\nThis approach has been highly successful as an analytic tool. It\nmakes model-theoretic techniques applicable to linguistic reasoning,\nThis makes the underlying reasoning problems much more transparent, and\nmakes it possible to apply many well-developed areas of logic to\ngrammar formalisms. For more information on these topics, see\n Buszkowski 1996;\n Shieber 1992.\n9.2 Feature Structure Logic\n\n\nThe usefulness and scope of logical methods in relation to\nlinguistics is greatly increased by the development of techniques for\nanalyzing the way information attaches to linguistic units. It is very\nnatural to represent the information attaching, say, to a lexical item\nin the form of a set of functions (or attributes) that produce values\nin some linguistic domain. A pronoun x may have a number, a\nperson, and a case: if x = \u2018we\u2019 then\n\n\nnumber(x) = plural,\nperson(x) = first,\ncase(x) = nominative.\n\n\n\n\nIn more general cases, the values of these functions may themselves be\nlinguistic units that take on values for certain attributes. \n\n\nAllowing these functions to be partial provides a useful\ninformational representation of the stages of a linguistic parse; much\nof the work of parsing involves completing this partial information,\nsubject to constraints imposed by linguistic agreement conditions.\nFeature structures\u2014sets of identities that serve to evaluate\nlinguistic features\u2014have a natural algebraic interpretation, and\nthere is an elegant treatment of their logic. For more information and\nreferences, see\n Rounds 1996.\n9.3 Logic and Discourse\n\n\nThe reasoning associated with discourse is the probably the least\nwell understood area of computational linguistics. Although logical\ntechniques do not yet play a major role in discourse, they seem to\noffer one of the most promising ways of providing a uniform account of\nthe many forms of reasoning that are involved in generating and\ninterpreting language in interactive conversation.\n\n\nWe  briefly mention three contributions to this area. Building on\nthe fact that the rules governing conversation are exception-ridden,\nAlex Lascarides and Nicholas Asher have developed techniques for\nformalizing discourse phenomena based on nonmonotonic logic; see\n Asher & Lascarides 1994,\n Asher & Lascarides 1997.\n Jerry\nHobbs and various co-workers look at the inference processes used in\ndiscourse as abductive, and propose to formalize abduction as\na search for a proof in which certain \u201clow-cost\u201d assumptions may be\nmade which serve as data or additional axioms for the proof.\n Hobbs et al. 1993\n shows how an\nimpressive range of discourse phenomena can be formalized using this\nidea. In practice, this abductive account looks rather similar to that\nof Lascarides and Asher, because it involves deploying axioms about\ndiscourse (in the form of Horn clause rules supplemented with weights\ngiving the assumption costs of premises) that in effect are\nnonmonotonic.\n\n\nIn more recent work, Matthew Stone shows in\n Stone 1998\n how modal logic can inform the\ncomplex reasoning involved in natural language generation. Generating a\ncoherent, appropriately phrased text that usefully performs a\ntask-oriented communication task is difficult to formalize because it\nrequires the integration of complex and sophisticated domain\ninformation with discourse planning, user modeling, and linguistic\nconstraints. Stone shows that modal logic can be used to modularize the\nformalization of the information required in this task; he also shows\nhow modal theorem proving can be used to implement the reasoning.\n10. Taxonomic Representation and Reasoning\n10.1 Concept-Based Classification\n\n\nTraditionally, the task of representing large amounts of domain\ninformation for general-purpose reasoning has been one of the most\nimportant areas of knowledge representation. Systems that exploit the\nintuitive taxonomic organization of domains are useful for this\npurpose; taxonomic hierarchies not only help to organize the process of\nknowledge acquisition, but provide a useful connection to rule-based\nreasoning.[41]\n\n\nFor domains in which complex definitions are a natural way to\norganize information, knowledge engineering services based on\ndefinitions of concepts have been extremely successful. Like\nvariable-free versions of first-order logic (see, for instance,\n Quine 1960,\n these systems are centered on\nconcepts or first-order predicates, and provide a number of mechanisms\nfor their definition. The fundamental algorithm associated with these\ntaxonomic logics is a classifier which inputs a system of\ndefinitions and outputs the entailment relations between defined and\nprimitive concepts. For background on these systems, see\n Woods & Schmolze 1992\n and\n Brachman et al. 1991.\n\n\nThe simplest taxonomic logics can be regarded as subsystems of\nfirst-order logic with complex predicates; but they have been extended\nin many ways, and the issues raised by many of these extensions overlap\nin many cases with topics in philosophical logic.\n10.2 Nonmonotonic Inheritance\n\n\nMuch more complex logical issues arise when the organization of a\ndomain into hierarchies is allowed to have exceptions. One way to\napproach this topic is to explore how to make a taxonomic logic\nnonmonotonic; but nonmonotonic inheritance is a topic in its\nown right. Although there are strong affinities to nonmonotonic logic,\nnonmonotonic logic relies more heavily on graph-based representations\nthan on traditional logical ideas, and seems to provide a much\nfiner-grained approach to nonmonotonic reasoning that raises entirely\nnew issues, and which quickly becomes problematic. For this reason,\nsystems of nonmonotonic inheritance tend to be expressively weak, and\ntheir relations to the more powerful nonmonotonic logic has never been\nfully clarified. For background on this topic, see\n Thomason 1992,\n Horty 1994.\n11. Contextual Reasoning\n\n\nIn the tradition in philosophical logic dealing with contextual\neffects on the interpretation of expressions, as well as in the more\nrecent tradition in dynamic logic, context is primarily formalized as\nan assignment of values to variables, and the language is designed to\nmake explicit reasoning about context either very limited or outright\nimpossible.\n\n\nConcern in AI about the representation of large and apparently\nheterogeneous domains and about the integration of disparate knowledge\nsources, as well as interests in formalizing common sense of the sort\ndiscussed in\n Section 2.2,\n above, have led to\ninterest in the AI community in formalizing languages that take context\ninto account more explicitly.\n\n\nIn\n McCarthy 1993b,\n McCarthy\nrecommends the study of languages containing a construct\nist(c,\u03c6),\n\n\nwhere ist is read \u201cis-true.\u201d This is analogous to the\nHolds construct of the situation calculus\u2014but now\nc stands for a context, and \u03c6 is a possibly complex\npropositional representation, which many (including McCarthy) take to\nrefer to a sentence. \n\n\nThere are analogies here both to modal logic and to languages with an\nexplicit truth predicate. But the applications that are envisioned for\na logic of context create opportunities and problems that are in many\nways new.  Work on the logic of context subsequent to McCarthy\u2019s\noriginal suggestion, includes \nMcCarthy &\nBuvac 1998, Guha 1991, and some of\nthe papers in the conference volumes\nAkman et al. 2001,\n Bouquet et al. 1999.\nFor extensions of Richard Montague\u2019s Intensional Logic motivated by\nMcCarthy\u2019s suggestions, see Thomason 2003\nand 2005.\n\n\nFor some reason, work on the explicit formalization of context hasn\u2019t\nbeen actively pursued by the computational community beyond this point.\nPhilosophical interest in context, and especially in the interaction\nof context with propositional attitudes and modals, continues to be\nstrong; but the very general logical frameworks for context that \nMcCarthy envisioned have yet not been taken up by philosophers.\n12. Prospects for a Logical Theory of Practical Reason\n\n\nThere is reason to hope that the combination of logical\nmethods with planning applications in AI can enable the development of\na far more comprehensive and adequate theory of practical reasoning\nthan has heretofore been possible. As with many problems having to do\nwith common sense reasoning, the scale and complexity of the\nformalizations that are required are beyond the traditional techniques\nof philosophical logic. However, with computational methods of\nimplementing and testing the formalizations and with areas such as\ncognitive robotics to serve as laboratories for developing and testing\nideas, we can hope to radically advance a problem that has seen little\nprogress since it was first proposed by Aristotle: the problem of\ndevising a formalization of practical reasoning that is genuinely\napplicable to common sense reasoning problems. \n\n\nThe classical work in deontic logic that was begun by von Wright\n(see\n von Wright 1983)\n is one source of\nideas; see\n (Horty 2001,\n van der Torre 1997).\n In fact, as the\nmore recent work in deontic logic shows, nonmonotonic logic provides a\nnatural and useful supplement to the classical deontic logic.  One\nrecent work (Horty 2012) seeks \nto base deontic logic on a prioritized version of Reiter\u2019s default logic.\n\n\n\nAn even more robust account of practical reasoning begins to emerge\nwhen these ideas are supplemented with work on the foundations of\nplanning and reasoning about action that were discussed in\n Section 4,\n above. But this development can be pursued\neven further, by extending the formalism to include preferences and\nintentions.[42]\n\n\nUltimately, what is needed is a model of an intelligent reasoning\nand acting agent. Developing such a model need not be entirely a matter\nof logic, but according to one school of thought, logic has a central\nrole to play in it; see, for instance,\n Baral & Gelfond 2000,\n Wobcke et al. 1998,\n Rao & Georgeff 1991,\n Burkhard et al. 1998).",
