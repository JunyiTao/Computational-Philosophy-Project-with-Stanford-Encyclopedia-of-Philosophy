For Felsenstein and\nmany other phylogeneticists, showing that parsimony is statistically\ninconsistent is a fatal blow. But not everyone agrees. In fact, some\nauthors argue that it is close to an irrelevant consideration. We now\nturn to this debate about the importance of consistency as an example\nof how philosophy plays a central role in phylogenetic theory.\n\nLike Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza before him, Felsenstein (1978) treats\nphylogenetic inference as a problem for statistics. Jerzy Neyman\n(1971) pointed to the emerging field of molecular phylogenetics as a\nsource of novel and interesting statistical problems. In the\nintervening fifty years the field has only expanded in importance to\nthe point where phylogenetic inference is now one of the central\nproblems in statistics. Similarly, research on algorithms for\ninferring phylogenies has been important in computer science for\ndecades.\n\nIf phylogenetic inference is seen as a problem in statistical\ninference, it might be thought that general arguments for ideal\nstatistical methods will just apply in this case. Maximum likelihood\nor Bayesian methods could be defended on these grounds for example. In\nthis light, parsimony is a statistical method and as such, we can\nstudy its statistical properties (Felsenstein 1983, 2004). Anthony\nEdwards (1996) claims that his initial usage of the \u201cminimum\nevolution\u201d principle was as an approximation to the maximum\nlikelihood solution which he believed to be justified on general,\nstatistical grounds, i.e., parsimony methods could be assessed as a\nstatistical approach. Since that time, a number of authors have shown\nexact connections (ordinally equivalent rankings) between parsimony\nand likelihood in a range of cases (Felsenstein 1973; Sober 1985;\nTuffley & Steel 1997; Steel & Penny 2000).\n\nIn an exchange on parsimony and likelihood between Felsenstein and\nElliott Sober, Felsenstein defends the idea that consistency \u201cis\na fundamental property\u201d and in particular, that it is more\nfundamental than likelihood (Felsenstein & Sober 1986). He\nreiterates his earlier claim that\n\n\nmaximum likelihood methods are not desirable in themselves, but\nbecause they have desirable statistical properties such as consistency\nand asymptotic efficiency. (Felsenstein 1978: 408)\n\n\nWith this attitude, Felsenstein is merely following an old and\nvenerable position in statistics. For example, Fisher (1956: 141)\ncalled consistency \u201cthe fundamental criterion of\nestimation\u201d and said that inconsistent estimators are\n\u201coutside the pale of decent usage\u201d (Fisher 1935 [1950:\n11]). Neyman (1952: 188) agrees.\n\nContrary to Felsenstein\u2019s position, Sober claims that\n\n\nOne does not \u201cjustify\u201d a method by showing that there is\nan extremely special case in which it does its work well; nor does one\n\u201crefute\u201d a method by showing that there is another special\ncase in which it makes a hash of things. (Sober 1988b: 76)\n\n\nOne particular argument that he gives against consistency is that it\ncan conflict with likelihood. Sober (1988a) presents an example in\nwhich likelihood inference can fail to be consistent. But Sober\nfollows Anthony Edwards (1972) in positing that likelihood is a\n\u201cprimitive postulate\u201d which does not need justification\nbased on repeated sampling. If a likelihood inference can fail to be\nstatistically consistent but is still justified, then clearly\nconsistency cannot be a necessary criterion of justified\ninference.\n\nA different kind of worry about consistency is expressed by authors\nwho point out that it is not clear what consistent method we could\nuse. As the editors of Cladistics put it in their editorial\ndefending the use of parsimony,\n\n\nwe do not consider the hypothetical problem of statistical\ninconsistency to constitute a philosophical argument for the rejection\nof parsimony. All phylogenetic methods, including parsimony, may\nproduce inconsistent or otherwise inaccurate results for a given data\nset. (Editors 2016)\n\n\nMaximum likelihood estimation is known to be provably consistent under\na wide variety of conditions (Wald 1949), but several authors have\nargued that these conditions do not apply to estimating the tree\ntopology since tree topologies are discrete, not continuous,\nparameters (Yang 1996; Siddall 1998; Farris 1999). However, Swofford\net al. (2001) argue that Wald\u2019s conditions do apply and Yang\n(1994), Chang (1996), and Rogers (2001) prove that maximum likelihood\nis consistent under different assumptions about character evolution.\nBut regardless of which assumptions suffice for likelihood to be\nconsistent, some assumptions about the evolutionary process are\ndefinitely required. But what happens when the model we use is not the\ncorrect model? This is especially problematic when combined with the\nview that to be a correct model it should be true, and that we could\nnever know that our model was true or perhaps even that there is no\nsuch thing as a true model, as some pattern cladists have claimed\n(e.g., Brower 2016, 2018b). As Felsenstein (2004: 272) puts it,\n\n\nlikelihood is usually consistent if we use the correct model in our\nanalysis. When we use the wrong model, there are few guarantees.\n\n",
