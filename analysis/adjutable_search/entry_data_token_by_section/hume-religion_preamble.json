    "main_text": "\n\nDavid Hume\u2019s various writings concerning problems of religion\nare among the most important and influential contributions on this\ntopic. In these writings Hume advances a systematic, sceptical\ncritique of the philosophical foundations of various theological\nsystems. Whatever interpretation one takes of Hume\u2019s philosophy\nas a whole, it is certainly true that one of his most basic\nphilosophical objectives is to discredit the doctrines and dogmas of\ntraditional theistic belief. There are, however, some significant\npoints of disagreement about the exact nature and extent of\nHume\u2019s irreligious intentions. One of the most important of\nthese is whether Hume\u2019s sceptical position leads him to a view\nthat can be properly characterized as \u201catheism\u201d. \n\nThe primary aims of this article are: (1) to give an account of\nHume\u2019s main arguments as they touch on various particular issues\nrelating to religion; and (2) to answer to the question concerning the\ngeneral character of Hume\u2019s commitments on this subject.\n",
